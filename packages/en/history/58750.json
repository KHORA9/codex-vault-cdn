Lea,\r\nin the Office of the Librarian of Congress. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nCollins Printing House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of jurisprudence is the history of civilization. The\r\nlabors of the lawgiver embody not only the manners and customs of his\r\ntime, but also its innermost thoughts and beliefs, laid bare for our\r\nexamination with a frankness that admits of no concealment. These\r\nafford the surest outlines for a trustworthy picture of the past, of\r\nwhich the details are supplied by the records of the chronicler.\r\n\r\nIt is from these sources that I have attempted, in the present work, a\r\nbrief investigation into the group of laws and customs through which\r\nour forefathers sought to discover hidden truth when disputed between\r\nman and man. Not only do these throw light upon the progress of human\r\ndevelopment from primitive savagism to civilized enlightenment, but\r\nthey bring into view some of the strangest mysteries of the human mind.\r\n\r\nIn this edition I have endeavored to indicate, more clearly than\r\nbefore, the source, in prehistoric antiquity, of some of the\r\nsuperstitions which are only even now slowly dying out among us, and\r\nwhich ever and anon reassert themselves under the thin varnish of our\r\nmodern rationalism.\r\n\r\nIn a greatly condensed form the first three essays originally appeared\r\nin the North American Review.\r\n\r\n  June, 1878.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough in the revision of this volume for a fourth edition there has\r\nnot been found much to alter, considerable additions have been made\r\nwhich render the survey of the subject more complete. In revising the\r\nessays on the Wager of Battle and the Ordeal I have had the advantage\r\nof the labors of two recent writers, Dr. Patetta, whose “Le Ordalie” is\r\nan extended and philosophical investigation into the whole topic of the\r\nJudgments of God, and George Neilson, Esq., whose “Trial by Combat” is\r\na complete account, from the original sources, of the history of the\r\njudicial duel in Great Britain. Mr. Neilson has also had the courtesy\r\nto communicate to me the results of his further studies of the subject.\r\nI therefore indulge the hope that the present edition will be found\r\nmore worthy of the favor with which the work has been received.\r\n\r\n  PHILADELPHIA, October, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  THE WAGER OF LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n

I.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE KINDRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conception of crime as a wrong committed against society is\r\ntoo abstract to find expression in the institutions of uncivilized\r\ncommunities. The slayer or the spoiler is an enemy, not of his fellows\r\nin general, but only of the sufferer or of his kindred; and if society\r\ncan provide means for the wronged to exact reparation, it has done\r\nits duty to the utmost, and has, indeed, made a notable advance on\r\nthe path that leads from barbarism to civilization. How recent has\r\nbeen our progress beyond this stage of development is illustrated\r\nin the provisions of a code granted so lately as 1231 by the Abbey\r\nof St. Bertin to the town of Arques. By these laws, when a man was\r\nconvicted of intentional homicide, he was handed over to the family\r\nof the murdered person, to be slain by them in turn.[1] It still was\r\nvengeance, and not justice, that was to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn early times, therefore, the wrong-doer owed no satisfaction to the\r\nlaw or to the state, but only to the injured party. That injured party,\r\nmoreover, was not a mere individual. All the races of the great Aryan\r\nbranch of mankind have developed through a common plan of organization,\r\nin which each family—sometimes merely the circle of near kindred,\r\nat others enlarged into a _gens_ or sept—was a unit with respect to\r\nthe other similar aggregations in the tribe or nation, presenting,\r\nwith respect to personal rights, features analogous to their communal\r\nholding of land.[2] Within these units, as a general rule, each\r\nindividual was personally answerable for all, and all were answerable\r\nfor each. A characteristic incident of this system was the _wer-gild_\r\nor blood-money, through which offences were condoned and the aggrieved\r\nwere satisfied by a payment made, when the crime was homicide, to the\r\nkindred of the slain, and generally contributed by the kindred of the\r\nslayer.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of the Avesta are the earliest records of Aryan\r\nlegislation that have reached us, and in them we find distinctly marked\r\nevidence of this common responsibility of the kindred.[3] Among the\r\nHindus, the ancient code, known as the Manava Dharma Sastra, represents\r\na highly complex social organization, in which primitive institutions\r\nhave been completely overlaid by the later and antagonistic elements\r\nof caste and Brahmanism, but yet it reveals the existence of village\r\ncommunities which were a direct development of the primal system\r\nof the family;[4] and the ancient solidarity of these communities\r\nis shown in the provision that if a murder or robbery could not be\r\ntraced, the village in which it occurred was obliged to make it good,\r\nor that to which the track of the offender could be followed.[5] In\r\nthe adventures of the Kauravas and Pandavas, moreover, the Mahabharata\r\npreserves fragments of traditions conveying some indications of a\r\npre-existing solidarity among kindred.[6] Much more clearly defined\r\nwere the Hellenic organizations of the _patræ_ and _phratriæ_; while\r\nthe institution of the _wer-gild_ is seen in the wages earned by\r\nHeracles in serving Omphale, to be paid to the kinsmen of the murdered\r\nIphitus; and its existence can be traced to historic times in the\r\npayments provided by the Trallian laws to the families of the subject\r\nLeleges and Minyans who might be slain. Sir Henry Maine has acutely\r\nsuggested, also, that the belief in an hereditary curse, which plays\r\nso awful a part in Grecian legend, is derived from the primal idea\r\nof the solidarity of the family group.[7] In Rome, notwithstanding\r\nthe powerful Latin tendency to absorb all minor subdivisions into the\r\nstate, the institution of the _gens_, and the relationship between the\r\npatron and his clients, bear striking analogies to the organizations\r\nwhich we find among the Teutonic tribes as they emerge into history;\r\nwhile the fine imposed on the elder Horatius, to expiate for his son\r\nthe crime of slaying his sister, shows a remnant still existing of\r\nthe _wer-gild_ levied on the relatives.[8] The early legislation of\r\nthe Celts, both in the Irish and Welsh tribes, as we shall presently\r\nsee, carried the solidarity of the family to its highest point of\r\ndevelopment. The same institutions form a prominent feature of social\r\norganization among the Slavs. The Russian Mir, or communal society,\r\nis evidently a development of the original family; while the Ruskaia\r\nPrawda, the earliest extant code, promulgated by Yaroslav Vladomirovich\r\nin the eleventh century, allows the relatives of a murdered man either\r\nto kill the murderer or to accept a _wer-gild_ from him. The district,\r\nmoreover, in which a homicide occurs is liable to a fine, unless\r\nthe victim is an unknown stranger: as such, there are none to claim\r\ncompensation for him, he is outside of all family organization, and the\r\nlaw has no protection for him.[9] In Poland, the laws in force until\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century provided no other penalty for murder\r\nthan a _wer-gild_ to be divided among the kindred and friends of the\r\nslain; and during the fifteenth century there was only a short term of\r\nimprisonment added.[10] Among the southern Slavs the Zadruga takes the\r\nplace of the Russian Mir, and is a still more absolute and primitive\r\nform of family organization.[11]\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this all-pervading tendency of organization, the\r\nbarbarian tribes which overthrew the Roman Empire based their\r\ninstitutions on two general principles—the independence of the\r\nindividual freeman and the solidarity of the family group—and on these\r\nwere founded their simple forms of jurisprudence. As the criminal\r\nwas not responsible to the state, but to the injured party, personal\r\npunishments were unknown, and the law made no attempt to decree\r\nthem. All that it could do was to provide rude courts before which\r\na plaintiff could state his case, and a settled tariff of pecuniary\r\ncompensation to console him for his sufferings.[12] If he disdained\r\nthis peaceful process, he was at liberty to assemble his kindred and\r\nfriends, and exact what satisfaction he could with sword and axe.\r\nThe offender, moreover, could not legitimately refuse to appear when\r\nsummoned before the _mallum_, or judicial assembly of the tribe;\r\nnor could he, as a rule, claim the right of armed defence, if the\r\ncomplainant preferred to receive the money payment provided for the\r\noffence of which he might prove his antagonist guilty.\r\n\r\nThis _wer-gild_ was in no sense a fine inflicted as a punishment for\r\nguilt, but only a compensation to induce the injured party to forego\r\nhis right of reprisals, and the interest which society felt in it\r\nwas not in the repression of crime, but in the maintenance of peace\r\nby averting the endless warfare of hostile families. An Anglo-Saxon\r\nproverb, quoted approvingly in the laws of Edward the Confessor, as\r\ncollected by William the Conqueror, says: “Bicge spere of side oðer\r\nbere”—Buy off the spear from thy side or endure it.[13] The application\r\nof the system is to be seen in the minute and complex tariffs of crime\r\nwhich form so large a portion of the barbarian codes. Every attempt\r\nagainst person and property is rated at its appropriate price, from the\r\ntheft of a sucking pig to the armed occupation of an estate, and from a\r\nwound of the little finger to the most atrocious of parricides. To what\r\nextent this at last was carried may be seen in the Welsh codes, where\r\nevery hair of the eyelash is rated at a penny.[14]\r\n\r\nThis system introduced into legal proceedings a commercial spirit\r\nwhich seems strangely at variance with the savage heroism commonly\r\nattributed to our barbarian ancestors. In the translation by Mr. Dasent\r\nof the old Icelandic Saga of Burnt Njal is vividly set forth the\r\ncomplex procedure which arose from the development of these principles,\r\nwhereby suits could be sold and assigned by one party to another, and a\r\nplaintiff with a promising claim for damages would part with it to some\r\nspeculator who undertook the chances of the suit; or, if the prospects\r\nwere not encouraging, he would pay some shrewd lawyer or mighty\r\nwarrior to prosecute it in his stead. As either party in the primitive\r\nIcelandic code could at any moment interrupt the proceedings with a\r\nchallenge to single combat, or a powerful pleader might collect his\r\nfriends for a raid on the Althing, and thus break up the court, this\r\ntraffic in suits was a speculation well fitted to vary the monotony of\r\na sea-rover’s life on shore.\r\n\r\nIn the application of this principle of compensation the solidarity\r\nof the family bore a part as conspicuous as in the alternative of\r\nprivate warfare. The kindred of the offender were obliged to contribute\r\nshares proportionate to their degrees of relationship; while those of\r\nthe man who was wronged received respective percentages calculated on\r\nthe same basis. Thus the most ancient Barbarian code that has reached\r\nus—that of the Feini, or primitive Irish—in a fanciful quadripartite\r\nenumeration of the principles in force in levying fines, alludes to\r\nthe responsibility of kindred—“And because there are four things for\r\nwhich it is levied: ‘cin’ (one’s own crime), and ‘tobhach’ (the crime\r\nof a near kinsman), ‘saighi’ (the crime of a middle kinsman), and the\r\ncrime of a kinsman in general.”[15] A very complete example of the\r\ndevelopment of this system is to be found in the Icelandic legislation\r\nof the twelfth century, where the fines exacted diminish gradually, as\r\nfar as the relatives in the fifth degree on both sides, each grade of\r\nthe criminal’s family paying its rate to the corresponding grade of the\r\nsufferer’s kindred.[16] When, however, the next of kin were females,\r\nand were thus incompetent to prosecute for murder, the person who\r\nundertook that office was rewarded with one-third of the fine.[17] It\r\nwas not until about 1270 that King Haco, in his unsuccessful attempt\r\nto reform these laws, ventured to decree that in cases of murder the\r\nblood-money should not be divided among the family of the victim, but\r\nshould all be paid to the heir.[18] On the other hand, in Denmark, Eric\r\nVII., in 1269, relieved the kindred of the murderer from contributing\r\nto the _wer-gild_, although it continued to be divided among the\r\nrelatives of the slain.[19]\r\n\r\nAmong the Welsh the provisions for levying and distributing the fines\r\nwere almost as complex as those of the early Icelandic law, one\r\nbody of jurisprudence extending the liability even as far as sixth\r\ncousins;[20] and perhaps the quaintest expression of the responsibility\r\nof the kindred is to be found in the regulation that if any one\r\nshould draw blood from the abbot of either of the seven great houses\r\nof Dyved, the offender should forfeit seven pounds, while a female\r\nof his kindred should become a washerwoman in token of disgrace.[21]\r\nThe firm hold which this practical solidarity of the family had upon\r\nthe jurisprudence of the European races is shown by a clause in the\r\nstatutes of the city of Lille, as late as the fourteenth century, where\r\nthe malefactor had the right to collect from his relatives a portion\r\nof the _wer-gild_ which he had incurred; and elaborate tables were\r\ndrawn up, showing the amount payable by each relative in proportion\r\nto his degree of kinship, the liability extending as far as to third\r\ncousins.[22] A still more pregnant example of the responsibility\r\nof kindred is found in the customs of Aspres, in 1184, where the\r\nkindred of a homicide, if they would abjure him by oath on relics,\r\nwere entitled to the public peace; but, if they refused to do so, it\r\nbecame the duty of the Count of Hainault, the Abbot of St. Vaast, and\r\nthe relatives of the slain, to hunt them down, and seize all their\r\nproperty.[23]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Christianity, with the all-pervading sacerdotalism\r\nof the church, rendered necessary an innovation on the primeval form\r\nof social organization, for ecclesiastical ties dissolved those of the\r\nfamily. By the Carlovingian legislation, when a priest was slain his\r\n_wer-gild_ was paid to the church, which was held to be nearer to him\r\nthan any relative,[24] though this regulation subsequently was modified\r\nso as to divide the composition into three parts, of which one was paid\r\nto the church of the deceased, one to his bishop, and the third to his\r\nkindred.[25] As a general rule, therefore, the clerk could claim no\r\nshare of the blood-money collected for the murder of his kinsmen; nor\r\nbe called upon to contribute to that incurred by his family;[26] though\r\nit is true that, by the Welsh laws of Hoel the Good, compiled in the\r\ntenth century, children, even prospective, were a link through which\r\nthe liability might be again incurred. “Neither clerks nor women are to\r\nhave a share of the _galanas_, since they are not avengers; however,\r\nthey are to pay for their children or to make oath that they shall\r\nnever have any.”[27]\r\n\r\nWith this exception, therefore, in its relations to the community,\r\neach family in the barbaric tribes was a unit, both for attack and\r\ndefence, whether recourse was had to the jealously preserved right of\r\nprivate warfare, or whether the injured parties contented themselves\r\nwith the more peaceful processes of the _mallum_ or _althing_. This\r\nsolidarity of the kindred is the key to much that would otherwise\r\nappear irrational in their legislation, and left, as we have seen, its\r\ntraces late in the customary law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OATH AND ITS ACCESSORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the commission of an offence and its proof in a court of\r\njustice there lies a wide field for the exercise or perversion of\r\nhuman ingenuity. The subject of evidence is one which has taxed man’s\r\nreasoning powers to the utmost; and the subtle distinctions of the\r\nRoman law, with its _probatio_, _præsumptio juris_, _præsumptio juris\r\ntantum_: the endless refinements of the glossators, rating evidence\r\nin its different grades, as _probatio optima_, _evidentissima_,\r\n_apertissima_, _legitima_, _sufficiens_, _indubitata_, _dilucida_,\r\n_liquida_, _evidens_, _perspicua_, and _semiplena_; and the artificial\r\nrules of the common law, so repugnant frequently to human common\r\nsense, all alike show the importance of the subject, and its supreme\r\ndifficulty. The semi-barbarian, impatient of such expenditure of logic,\r\narrived at results by a shorter process.\r\n\r\nThe time has passed for the romantic school of writers who assume that\r\nthe unsupported oath of the accused was originally sufficient to clear\r\nhim of a charge, when the fierce warrior disdained to shrink from the\r\nconsequences of his act. It was not, indeed, until long after the\r\nTeutonic tribes had declined from the assumed virtues of their native\r\nforests, that an unsupported oath was receivable as evidence, and the\r\nintroduction of such a custom may be traced to the influence of the\r\nRoman law, in which the importance of the oath was overwhelming.[28]\r\nThe Wisigoths, who moulded their laws on the Roman jurisprudence, were\r\nthe only race of barbarians who permitted the accused, in the absence\r\nof definite testimony, to escape on his single oath,[29] and this\r\nexception only tends to prove the rule, for at the council of Valence,\r\nin 855, the Wisigothic custom was denounced in the strongest terms\r\nas an incentive to perjury.[30] It is true that the oath of a master\r\ncould clear a slave accused of certain crimes,[31] which was no less an\r\nincentive to perjury, for the master was liable in case of conviction,\r\nbut presumably in such case he took upon himself the responsibility\r\nand laid himself open to an accusation of perjury. As a rule, however,\r\nwe may assume that the purgatorial power of a single oath was an\r\ninnovation introduced by the church, which was trained in the Roman\r\ninstitutions and claimed for its members the privilege, when testimony\r\nwas deficient, of clearing themselves by appealing in this manner to\r\nGod.[32] Continued contact with the remains of Roman civilization\r\nstrengthened the custom, and its development was to a great extent\r\ndue to the revival of the study of the imperial jurisprudence in the\r\ntwelfth century.[33] The primitive principle is well expressed in the\r\nFrisian code, where the pleader says, “I swear alone, if thou darest,\r\ndeny my oath and fight me,”[34] where the oath is only the preliminary\r\nto proof by the judgment of God.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to this in the early legislation of the barbarians\r\nare merely special immunities bestowed on rank. Thus in one of the\r\nmost primitive of the Anglo-Saxon codes, which dates from the seventh\r\ncentury, the king and the bishop are permitted to rebut an accusation\r\nwith their simple asseveration, and the thane and the mass-priest with\r\na simple oath, while the great body both of clerks and laymen are\r\nforced to clear themselves by undergoing the regular form of canonical\r\ncompurgation which will be hereafter described.[35] So, in the Welsh\r\nlegislation, exemption from the oath of absolution was accorded to\r\nbishops, lords, the deaf, the dumb, men of a different language, and\r\npregnant women.[36] Instances of class-privileges such as these may be\r\ntraced throughout the whole period of the dark ages, and prove nothing\r\nexcept the advantages claimed and enjoyed by caste. Thus, by the law of\r\nSouthern Germany, the unsupported oath of a claimant was sufficient,\r\nif he were a person of substance and repute, while, if otherwise,\r\nhe was obliged to provide two conjurators,[37] and in Castile, the\r\n_fijodalgo_, or noble, could rebut a claim in civil cases by taking\r\nthree solemn oaths, in which he invoked on himself the vengeance of God\r\nin this world and the next.[38]\r\n\r\nSo far, indeed, were the Barbarians from reposing implicit confidence\r\nin the integrity of their fellows that their earliest records show\r\nhow fully they shared in the common desire of mankind to place the\r\noath under the most efficient guarantees that ingenuity could devise.\r\nIn its most simple form the oath is an invocation of some deity or\r\nsupernatural power to grant or withhold his favor in accordance with\r\nthe veracity of the swearer, but at all times men have sought to render\r\nthis more impressive by interposing material objects dear to the\r\nindividual, which were understood to be offered as pledges or victims\r\nfor the divine wrath. Thus, among the Hindus, the ancient Manava Dharma\r\nSastra prescribes the oath as satisfactory evidence in default of\r\nevidence, but requires it to be duly reinforced—\r\n\r\n “In cases where there is no testimony, and the judge cannot decide\r\n upon which side lies the truth, he can determine it fully by\r\n administering the oath.\r\n\r\n “Oaths were sworn by the seven Maharshis, and by the gods, to make\r\n doubtful things manifest, and even Vasishtha sware an oath before the\r\n king Sudama, son of Piyavana, when Viswamitra accused him of eating a\r\n hundred children.\r\n\r\n “Let not the wise man take an oath in vain, even for things of little\r\n weight; for he who takes an oath in vain is lost in this world and the\r\n next.\r\n\r\n “Let the judge swear the Brahman by his truth; the Kshatriya by his\r\n horses, his elephants, or his arms; the Vaisya by his cows, his corn,\r\n and his gold; the Sudra by all crimes.”[39]\r\n\r\nAnd in the more detailed code of Vishnu there is an exceedingly\r\ncomplicated system of objects to be sworn upon, varying with the amount\r\nat stake and the caste of the swearer.[40]\r\n\r\nWe see the same custom in Greece, where Homer represents Hera as\r\nexculpating herself by an oath on the sacred head of Zeus, and on\r\ntheir marriage-bed, a practice which mortals imitated by swearing on\r\nthe heads of their children, or on that of their patron, or of the\r\nking.[41] Under the Roman law, oaths were frequently taken on the head\r\nof the litigant, or on those of his children.[42] The Norse warrior was\r\nsworn, like the Hindu Kshatriya, on his warlike gear:\r\n\r\n  “Oaths shalt thou\r\n  First to me swear,\r\n  By board of ship,\r\n  By rim of shield,\r\n  By shoulder of steed,\r\n  By edge of sword,\r\n  That thou wilt not slay\r\n  The wife of Volund,\r\n  Nor of my bride\r\n  Cause the death.”[43]\r\n\r\nWhen these material pledges were not offered, the sanctions of religion\r\nhave in all ages been called into play to impress the imagination of\r\nthe swearer with the awful responsibility incurred, the presence of the\r\ndeity being obtained by the offer of a sacrifice, or his interposition\r\nbeing assured by the use of some object of peculiar sacredness. In\r\nDeuteronomy, when the corpse of a murdered man was found, the elders\r\nof the nearest city disculpated themselves and their fellow-citizens\r\nbefore the Levites over the body of a heifer slain for the purpose.[44]\r\nWe see the same principle applied to promissory oaths in the horse\r\nwhich Tyndareus sacrificed and buried when he exacted from the suitors\r\nof Helen the oath that they would accede to her choice of a bridegroom\r\nand defend her and her husband against all comers;[45] and it is only\r\nnecessary to allude to the well-known Ara Maxima of Hercules in\r\nRome to show the prevalence of the same customs among the Italiotes.\r\nSimilar practices were familiar to the Norsemen. Among them the Godi\r\nwas both priest and judge, the judgment-seat adjoined the temple, and\r\nall parties to a suit, including judge and witnesses, were solemnly\r\nsworn upon the sacred ring kept for that purpose on the altar. It\r\nwas sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificial bull, and then the\r\noath was taken by invoking Freyr and Niord, and the almighty As to\r\nhelp the swearer as he should maintain truth and justice.[46] Yet so\r\nlittle did all these precautions serve to curb the untruthfulness of\r\nthe cunning sea-kings that in Viga-Glums Saga we find Glum denying\r\na charge of murder by an oath taken in three temples, in which he\r\ncalled Odin to witness in words so craftily framed that while he was\r\nin reality confessing his guilt he apparently was denying it most\r\ncircumstantially.[47]\r\n\r\nSimilarly in Christian times, the most venerated forms of religion\r\nwere, from a very early period, called in to lend sanctity to the\r\nimprecation, by devices which gave additional solemnity to the awful\r\nceremony. In this the natural tendency of the church to follow the\r\ntraditional customs of the populations from which its members were\r\ndrawn was reinforced by the example of the practices of Judaism. The\r\n“covenant between the pieces,” by which Yahveh confirmed his promises\r\nto Abram, and by which the Jews renewed their promises to him, was\r\na sacrificial ceremony of the most impressive character, only to be\r\nused on occasions of supreme importance. As soon as a permanent place\r\nof worship was provided, the altar in the temple was resorted to\r\nby litigants in order that the oath might be taken in the presence\r\nof Yahveh himself; and so powerful was the impression of this upon\r\nthe Christian mind that in the early ages of the church there was a\r\npopular superstition that an oath taken in a Jewish synagogue was more\r\nbinding and more efficient than one taken elsewhere.[48] These beliefs\r\ndeveloped into a great variety of formulas, which would reward an\r\nexamination more detailed than that which I can give them here.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the sixth century, Pope Pelagius I. did not disdain\r\nto absolve himself from the charge of having been concerned in the\r\ntroubles which drove his predecessor Vigilius into exile, by taking a\r\ndisculpatory oath in the pulpit, holding over his head a crucifix and\r\nthe gospels;[49] and in the eighth century a priest accused without\r\nwitnesses to prove his guilt was enabled to absolve himself by placing\r\nthe cross upon his head and declaring his innocence by the Everlasting\r\nGod.[50] So, when the holy Gregory of Tours was accused of reproachful\r\nwords truly spoken of Queen Fredegonda, a council of bishops decided\r\nthat he should clear himself of the charge by oaths on three altars,\r\nafter celebrating mass on each, which he duly performed, doubtless\r\nmore to his corporeal than his spiritual benefit.[51] This plan of\r\nreduplicating oaths on different altars was an established practice\r\namong the Anglo-Saxons, who, in certain cases, allowed the plaintiff\r\nto substantiate his assertion by swearing in four churches, while the\r\ndefendant could rebut the charge by taking an oath of negation in\r\ntwelve.[52] Seven altars are similarly specified in the ancient Welsh\r\nlaws in cases where a surety desired to deny his suretyship;[53] and,\r\naccording to the _Fleta_, as late as the thirteenth century, a custom\r\nwas current among merchants of proving the payment of a debt by\r\nswearing in nine churches, the abuse of which led to its abrogation.[54]\r\n\r\nThe intense veneration with which relics were regarded, however, caused\r\nthem to be generally adopted as the most effective means of adding\r\nsecurity to oaths, and so little respect was felt for the simple oath\r\nthat, ere long, the adjuncts came to be looked upon as the essential\r\nfeature, and the imprecation itself to be divested of binding force\r\nwithout them. Thus, in 680, when Ebroin, mayor of the palace of\r\nBurgundy, had defeated Martin, Duke of Austrasia, and desired to entice\r\nhim from his refuge in the stronghold of Laon, two bishops were sent\r\nto him bearing the royal reliquaries, on which they swore that his\r\nlife should be safe. Ebroin, however, had astutely removed the holy\r\nremains from their cases in advance, and when he thus got his enemy\r\nin his power, he held it but a venial indiscretion to expose Martin\r\nto a shameful death.[55] How thoroughly this was in accordance with\r\nthe ideas of the age is shown by the incorporation, in the canons of\r\nthe church, of the doctrine that an oath was to be estimated by its\r\nexternals and not by itself. The penitential of David, dating from the\r\nlatter half of the sixth century, provides that perjury committed in\r\na church shall be punished by a fine of four times the value of that\r\nfor which the false oath was taken,[56] but no penalty is provided for\r\nfalse swearing elsewhere. As the theory developed itself this tacit\r\ncondoning of such perjury was boldly declared to be good ecclesiastical\r\nlaw, and the venerable code of morality which passes under the name of\r\nTheodore Archbishop of Canterbury assumes that a false oath taken on\r\na consecrated cross requires, for absolution, three times the penance\r\nnecessary in cases where the oath had been taken on an unconsecrated\r\none, while, if the ministration of a priest had not been employed, the\r\noath was void, and no penalty was inflicted for its violation.[57] In\r\na similar mood the penitential known as that of Gregory III. provides\r\nthat three years’ penance will absolve for perjury committed on a\r\nconsecrated cross or on the hand of a bishop or priest, while seven\r\nyears are requisite if the oath has been taken on the gospels or on\r\nan altar with relics.[58] This rule took its final shape in the canon\r\nlaw, which provides one year’s penance for perjury committed on an\r\nunconsecrated cross, and three years’ for that on a consecrated one, or\r\non the hand of a bishop.[59]\r\n\r\nThese principles were adopted as the fundamental basis of all legal\r\nprocedures in Wales. Every prosecution and defence required relics to\r\ngive validity to the oaths of both parties, and even in the fifteenth\r\ncentury a collection of laws declares that a plaintiff coming into\r\ncourt without a relic on which to make his oath, not only lost his\r\ncause, but incurred a fine of nine-score pence. The same tendency is\r\nshown in the rule by which a man who suspected another of theft could\r\ngo to him with a relic, and in the presence of witnesses demand an oath\r\nof negation, a failure in which was a conviction of the crime imputed,\r\nwithout further trial.[60] In the same spirit, ecclesiastical authority\r\nwas even found to admit that a powerful motive might extenuate the sin\r\nof perjury. If committed voluntarily, seven years of penitence were\r\nenjoined for its absolution; if involuntarily, sixteen months, while\r\nif to preserve life or limb, the offence could be washed out with four\r\nmonths.[61] When such doctrines were received and acted upon, we can\r\nhardly wonder at the ingenious device which the sensitive charity of\r\nKing Robert the Pious imitated from the duplicity of Ebroin, to save\r\nthe souls of his friends. He provided two reliquaries on which to\r\nreceive their oaths—one for his magnates, splendidly fabricated of\r\ncrystal and gold, but entirely empty, the other for the common herd,\r\nplainer and enshrining a bird’s egg. Knowing in advance that his\r\nlieges would be forsworn, he thus piously sought to save them from sin\r\nin spite of themselves, and his monkish panegyrist is delighted in\r\nrecounting this holy deceit.[62]\r\n\r\nIt was easy, from a belief such as this, to draw the deduction that\r\nwhen an oath was sworn on relics of peculiar sanctity, immediate\r\npunishment would follow perjury; and thus it followed that some\r\nshrines obtained a reputation which caused them to be resorted to in\r\nthe settlement of disputed judicial questions. Even as early as St.\r\nAugustin there are traces of such practices, which that Father of\r\nthe Church not only records, but imitated,[63] and at a later period\r\nthe legends are numerous which record how the perjured sinner was\r\nstricken down senseless or rendered rigid and motionless in the act\r\nof swearing falsely.[64] From this point of view oaths were really\r\nordeals, and as such we shall consider them hereafter. At present it\r\nsuffices to observe that the profit which the church derived from\r\nthus administering oaths on relics affords an easy explanation of her\r\nteachings, and of the extension of these practices. Their resultant\r\nadvantages are well illustrated by the example of the holy taper of\r\nCardigan, in Wales. A miraculous image of the Virgin was cast ashore,\r\nbearing this taper burning in its hand. A church was built for it, and\r\nthe taper “contynued styll burnynge the space of nyne yeres, without\r\nwastynge, until the tyme that one forsware himselfe thereon, so then\r\nit extincted, and never burned after.” At the suppression of the house\r\nunder Henry VIII., the prior, Thomas Hore, testified: “Item, that\r\nsince the ceasynge of burnynge of the sayd taper, it was enclosed and\r\ntaken for a greate relyque, and so worshipped and kyssed of pylgremes,\r\nand used of men to sweare by in difficill and harde matters, whereof\r\nthe advauntage admounted to greate sommes of money in tymes passed,\r\npayenge yerely to the same XXti nobles for a pencion unto thabbott of\r\nChersey.”[65]\r\n\r\nIn all this Spain would seem to be exceptional. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury the rule is expressed that a pleader must take the oath\r\nrequired of him by his antagonist; if he is required to swear by God,\r\nit will not suffice for him to swear by some saint, or by his own head.\r\nOaths could indeed be taken on crosses or altars, but they could also\r\nbe reduced to the simplest asseveration. Thus, there is a provision\r\nthat if one party says “Swear to me on your simple word,” then the\r\nreply “know that it is so,” or “believe me that it is so,” suffices,\r\nand has all the force of the most solemn adjuration.[66]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONJURATORS, OR PARTAKERS IN THE OATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the earnestness with which these teachings were\r\nenforced, it may readily be believed that the wild barbarian, who was\r\nclamoring for the restoration of stolen cattle, or the angry relatives,\r\neager to share the _wer-gild_ of some murdered kinsman, would scarce\r\nsubmit to be balked of their rights at the cost of simple perjury on\r\nthe part of the criminal. We have seen that both before and after their\r\nconversion to Christianity they had little scruple in defiling the most\r\nsacred sanctions of the oath with cunning fraud, and they could repose\r\nlittle confidence in the most elaborate devices which superstition\r\ncould invent to render perjury more to be dreaded than defeat. It was\r\ntherefore natural that they should perpetuate an ancestral custom,\r\nwhich had arisen from the structure of their society, and which derived\r\nits guarantee from the solidarity of families alluded to above. This\r\nwas the custom which was subsequently known as canonical compurgation,\r\nand which long remained a part of English jurisprudence, under the\r\nname of the Wager of Law. The defendant, when denying the allegation\r\nunder oath, appeared surrounded by a number of companions—_juratores_,\r\n_conjuratores_, _sacramentales_, _collaudantes_, _compurgatores_, as\r\nthey were variously termed—who swore, not to their knowledge of the\r\nfacts, but as sharers and partakers in the oath of denial.\r\n\r\nThis form of procedure derives importance from the fact that it is an\r\nexpression of the character, not of an isolated sept, but of nearly all\r\nthe races that have moulded the destinies of modern Europe. Although\r\nunknown to the Roman law, there are traces of it in the ancient\r\nHellenic legislation.[67] The Ostrogoths in Italy, and the Wisigoths\r\nof the south of France and Spain were the only nations in whose extant\r\ncodes it occupies no place, and they, as has already been remarked,\r\nat an early period yielded themselves completely to the influence\r\nof the Roman civilization.[68] On the other hand, the Salians, the\r\nRipuarians, the Alamanni, the Baioarians, the Lombards, the Frisians,\r\nthe Norsemen, the Saxons, the Angli and Werini, the Anglo-Saxons, and\r\nthe Welsh, races whose common origin must be sought in the prehistoric\r\npast, all gave to this form of purgation a prominent position in their\r\njurisprudence, and it may be said to have reigned from Southern Italy\r\nto Scotland.[69]\r\n\r\nThe earliest text of the Salic law presents us with the usages of the\r\nFranks unaltered by any allusions to Christianity, and it may therefore\r\nbe presumed to date from a period not later than the conversion of\r\nClovis. In this primitive code there are directions for the employment\r\nof conjurators, which show that the procedure was a settled and\r\nestablished form at that period.[70] So in the Frisian law, which,\r\nalthough compiled in the eighth century, still reveals pagan customs\r\nand the primitive condition of society, the practice of compurgation\r\nevidently forms the basis of judicial proceedings. The Islands\r\nLandnamabok also exhibits it as a form of regular procedure among the\r\nheathen Norsemen. Although the other codes have only reached us in\r\nrevisions subsequent to the conversion of the several tribes, still,\r\nthe universal use of the practice shows that its origin must be traced\r\nto a period anterior to the separation of the several races from the\r\noriginal common stock.\r\n\r\nThe church, with the tact which distinguished her dealings with her\r\nnew converts, was not long in adopting a system which was admirably\r\nsuited for her defence in an age of brute force. As holy orders\r\nsundered all other ties, and as the church was regarded as one vast\r\nfamily, ecclesiastics speedily arrogated to themselves and obtained\r\nthe privilege of having men of their own class as compurgators, and,\r\nthus fortified for mutual support, they were aided in resisting the\r\noppressors who invaded their rights on every hand. This claim, with\r\nall its attendant advantages, was fully conceded when Charlemagne, in\r\nthe year 800, went to Rome for the purpose of trying Pope Leo III.\r\non a grave charge, and in that august presence the Pontiff, whom no\r\nwitnesses dared to accuse, cleared himself of the crimes imputed to him\r\nby solemnly taking the oath of denial in company with twelve priests\r\nas compurgators.[71] Three years afterwards, the Emperor decreed\r\nthat, in all doubtful cases, priests should defend themselves with\r\nthree, five, or seven ecclesiastical compurgators, and he announced\r\nthat this decision had been reached by the common consent of pope,\r\npatriarchs, bishops, and all the faithful.[72] It is true that a few\r\nmonths later, on being shown a decretal of Gregory II.[73] ordering the\r\nclergy to rebut with their single oaths all accusations unsupported by\r\nwitnesses, he modified his previous command, and left the matter to\r\nthe discretion of his prelates; but this had no practical result, for\r\nCharlemagne’s capitulary was adopted in the canon law and ascribed to\r\nLeo himself.[74] The custom soon received the papal sanction again in\r\nthe most solemn manner. In 823, Pope Pascal I. was more than suspected\r\nof complicity in the murder of Theodore and Leo, two high dignitaries\r\nof the papal court. Desirous to avoid an investigation by the\r\ncommissioners sent by Louis le Débonnaire, he hastily purged himself\r\nof the crime in anticipation of their arrival, by an oath taken with a\r\nnumber of bishops as his compurgators;[75] and it is a striking example\r\nof the weight accorded to the procedure that, although the assumed\r\nfault of the victims had been their devotion to the imperial party,\r\nand though the pope had by force of arms prevented any pursuit of the\r\nmurderers, the emperor was powerless to exact satisfaction, and there\r\nwas nothing further to be done. Pope Pascal stood before the world an\r\ninnocent man.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, in the tenth century, Atto of Vercelli complains\r\nbitterly that a perverse generation refused to be satisfied with the\r\nsingle oath of an accused priest, and required him to be surrounded\r\nby compurgators of his class, which that indignant sacerdotalist\r\nregarded as a grievous wrong.[76] As the priesthood, however, failed\r\nin obtaining the entire immunity for which they strove during those\r\nturbulent times, the unquestioned advantages which compurgation\r\nafforded recommended it to them with constantly increasing force.\r\nForbidden at length to employ the duel in settling their differences,\r\nand endeavoring, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, to obtain\r\nexemption from the ordeal, they finally accepted compurgation as the\r\nspecial mode of trial adapted to members of the church, and for a long\r\nperiod we find it recognized as such in all the collections of canons\r\nand writings of ecclesiastical jurists.[77] From this fact it obtained\r\nits appellation of _purgatio canonica_, or canonical compurgation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF COMPURGATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the origin of the custom is to be traced to the\r\nprinciple of the unity of families. As the offender could summon his\r\nkindred around him to resist an armed attack of the injured party, so\r\nhe took them with him to the court, to defend him with their oaths.\r\nAccordingly, we find that the service was usually performed by the\r\nkindred, and in some codes this is even prescribed by law, though not\r\nuniversally.[78] This is well illustrated in the Welsh laws, where the\r\n_raith_, or compurgation, was the basis of almost all procedure, and\r\nwhere consequently the system was brought to its fullest perfection.\r\nComplicated rules existed as to the proportion of paternal and maternal\r\nkindred required in various cases, and the connection between the\r\n_wer-gild_ and the obligation of swearing in defence of a kinsman was\r\nfully recognized—“Because the law adjudges the men nearest in worth\r\nin every case, excepting where there shall be men under vows to deny\r\nmurder,” therefore the compurgators were required to be those “nearest\r\nto obtain his worth if killed.”[79] Under these circumstances, the\r\n_raith-man_ could be objected to on the score of not being of kin, when\r\nthe oaths of himself and his principal were received as sufficient\r\nproof of relationship;[80] and the _alltud_, or foreigner, was not\r\nentitled to the raith unless he had kindred to serve on it.[81] How the\r\ncustom sometimes worked in practice among the untameable barbarians is\r\nfairly illustrated by a case recounted by Aimoin as occurring under\r\nChilperic I. in the latter half of the sixth century. A wife suspected\r\nby her husband offered the oath of purgation on the altar of St. Denis\r\nwith her relatives, who were persuaded of her innocence; the husband\r\nnot yet satisfied, accused the compurgators of perjury, and the fierce\r\npassions of both parties becoming excited, weapons were speedily drawn,\r\nand the sanctity of the venerable church was profaned with blood.[82]\r\n\r\nIt was manifestly impossible, however, to enforce the rule of kinship\r\nin all cases, for the number of compurgators varied in the different\r\ncodes, and in all of them a great number were required when the matter\r\nat stake was large, or the crime or criminal important. Thus when\r\nChilperic I. was assassinated in 584, doubts were entertained as to\r\nthe legitimacy of his son Clotair, an infant of four months—doubts\r\nwhich neither the character of Queen Fredegonda nor the manner of\r\nChilperic’s death had any tendency to lessen—and Gontran, brother of\r\nthe murdered king, did not hesitate to express his belief that the\r\nroyal child’s paternity was traceable to some one of the minions of\r\nthe court, a belief doubtless stimulated by the promise it afforded\r\nhim of another crown. Fredegonda, however, repaired her somewhat\r\nquestionable reputation and secured the throne to her offspring, by\r\nappearing at the altar with three bishops and three hundred nobles,\r\nwho all swore with her as to the legitimacy of the little prince,\r\nand no further doubts were ventured on the delicate subject.[83] A\r\nsimilar case occurred in Germany in 899, when Queen Uta cleared herself\r\nof an accusation of infidelity, by taking a purgatorial oath with\r\neighty-two nobles.[84] So in 824, a dispute between Hubert, Bishop\r\nof Worcester, and the Abbey of Berkeley, concerning the monastery of\r\nWestbury, was settled by the oath of the bishop, supported by those\r\nof fifty mass-priests, ten deacons, and a hundred and fifty other\r\necclesiastics.[85] These were, perhaps, exceptional instances, but\r\nin Wales the law required, as a regular matter, enormous numbers of\r\ncompurgators in many cases. Privity to homicide, for instance, was\r\ndivided into three triads, or nine classes of various degrees of\r\nguilt. Of these, the first triad called for one hundred raith-men to\r\nestablish the denial; the second triad, 200, and the third, 300;[86]\r\nwhile, to rebut an accusation of killing with savage violence or\r\npoisoning, the enormous number of six hundred compurgators was\r\nconsidered necessary.[87] Even these armies of oath-takers did not\r\nwiden the circle from which selection was allowed, for the law\r\nabsolutely specifies that “the oaths of three hundred men of a kindred\r\nare required to deny murder, blood, and wound,”[88] and the possibility\r\nof finding them is only explicable by the system of tribes or clans in\r\nwhich all were legally related one to another. This is illustrated by\r\na further regulation, according to which, under the Gwentian code, in\r\nan accusation of theft, with positive evidence, the thief was directed\r\nto clear himself with twenty-four raith=men of his own _cantrev_ or\r\ndistrict, in equal number from each _cymwd_ or sub-district.[89]\r\n\r\nUnder a different social organization, it is evidently impossible\r\nthat a kindred sufficiently large could have been assembled in the\r\nmost numerous families, and even when the requirements were more\r\nreasonable, the same difficulty must frequently have occurred. This\r\nis recognized in the Danish laws of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, where the conjuratorial oaths of kindred, known as _neffn\r\ni kyn_, were requisite, unless the accused could swear that he had no\r\nrelations, in which case he was allowed to produce twelve other men of\r\nproper character, _lag feste men_.[90] In a constitution of Frederic\r\nII. in 1235, the compurgators are required to be of the same class\r\nas their principal, and to be _sinodales homines_, men of undoubted\r\ncharacter.[91] Thus the aid of those not connected by ties of blood\r\nmust often have been necessary, and as it was a service not without\r\ndanger, as we shall see hereafter, it is not easy to understand how\r\nthe requisite number was reached. In certain cases, no doubt, the\r\npossibility of obtaining those not bound by kindred to undertake the\r\noffice is traceable to the liability which in some instances rested\r\nupon a township for crime committed within its borders;[92] while\r\nthe system of guilds in which the members shared with each other a\r\nresponsibility resembling that of kinship rendered participation in the\r\noath of denial almost a necessity when a comrade was prosecuted.[93]\r\n\r\nIt would be endless to specify all the variations in the numbers\r\nrequired by the different codes in all imaginable cases of quarrel\r\nbetween every class of society. Numerous elements entered into these\r\nregulations; the nature of the crime or claim, the station of the\r\nparties, the rank of the compurgators, and the mode by which they\r\nwere selected. Thus, in the simplest and most ancient form, the Salic\r\nlaw merely specifies twenty-five compurgators to be equally chosen by\r\nboth parties.[94] Some formulas of Marculfus specify three freeholders\r\nand twelve friends of the accused.[95] A Merovingian edict of 593\r\ndirects the employment of three peers of the defendant, with three\r\nothers chosen for the purpose, probably by the court.[96] Alternative\r\nnumbers, however, soon make their appearance, depending upon the manner\r\nin which the men were chosen. Thus among the Alamanni, on a trial\r\nfor murder, the accused was obliged to secure the support of twenty\r\ndesignated men, or, if he brought such as he had selected himself,\r\nthe number was increased to eighty.[97] So, in a capitulary of 803,\r\nCharlemagne prescribes seven chosen conjurators, or twelve if taken\r\nat random,[98] a rule which is virtually the same as that laid down\r\nby the Emperor Henry III. in the middle of the eleventh century.[99]\r\nIn 922 the council of Coblentz directs that accusations of sacrilege\r\ncould be rebutted with twenty-four chosen men, or seventy-two freemen\r\nnot thus selected.[100] In Bigorre the law thus discriminated against\r\nthe _cagots_—an infamous wandering race of uncertain origin—for cases\r\nin which the oaths of seven conjurators ordinarily sufficed required\r\nthirty _cagots_, when the latter were called upon to act.[101] In an\r\nEnglish record of the fifteenth century we find a defendant called\r\nupon to prove his innocence with six of his neighbors or twelve\r\nstrangers.[102]\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the church at one time adopted the principle that the\r\nhigher the rank of the accused the more he must present of his peers\r\nas compurgators. Thus the bishop required eleven bishops, the priest\r\nfive priests, and the deacon two deacons; but Cardinal Henry of Susa\r\nwho enunciates this says it is an error, and that the number is at the\r\ndiscretion of the judge.[103] The rule, moreover, that the compurgators\r\nmust be of the same rank and class as the accused was waived when they\r\nwere presumably inimical to him or the proper number could not be had,\r\nand thus a cleric might be cleared by the oaths of laymen.[104]\r\n\r\nVariations likewise occur arising from the nature of the case and the\r\ncharacter of the plaintiff. Thus in the Scottish law of the twelfth\r\ncentury, in a criminal charge, a man could defend himself against his\r\nlord with eleven men of good reputation, but if the king were the\r\naccuser, twenty-four were requisite, who were all to be his peers,\r\nwhile in a civil case twelve were sufficient.[105] So in the burgher\r\nlaws of David I., ordinary cases between citizens were settled with\r\nten conjurators, but eleven were necessary if the king were a party,\r\nor if the matter involved the life, limb, or lands of one of the\r\ncontestants; and in cases occurring between a citizen and a countryman,\r\neach party had to provide conjurators of his own class.[106] In the\r\ncomplicated rules for compurgation which form the basis of the Welsh\r\njurisprudence, there are innumerable details of this nature. We have\r\nseen that for some crimes many hundred _raith-men_ were required,\r\nwhile similar numbers were enjoined in some civil suits respecting\r\nreal property.[107] From this the number diminishes in proportion to\r\nthe gravity of the case, as is well illustrated by the provisions for\r\ndenying the infliction of a bruise. If the mark remained until the\r\nninth day, the accused could deny it with “two persons of the same\r\nprivilege as himself;” if it remained until the eighteenth day, the\r\noaths of three conjurators were necessary; if till the twenty-seventh\r\nday, four _raith-men_ were required.[108]\r\n\r\nThe character of the _raith-men_ also affected the number demanded.\r\nThus, in a collection of Welsh laws of the fifteenth century there\r\nis an explanation of the apparent anomaly that privity to theft\r\nor homicide required for its defence a vastly greater number of\r\ncompurgators than the commission of the crime itself. The large\r\nbodies prescribed for the former consisted simply of any men that\r\ncould be had—of course within the recognized grades of kindred—while,\r\nfor the latter, rules of varying complexity were laid down. Thus, of\r\nthe twenty-four required for theft, in some texts it is prescribed\r\nthat two-thirds are to be of the nearest paternal kin, and one-third\r\nof the nearest maternal; or, again, one-half _nod-men_.[109] So, in\r\naccusations of homicide, the same proportions of paternal and maternal\r\nkindred were required, all were to be proprietors in the country\r\nof the _raith_, and three, moreover, were to be men under vows of\r\nabstinence from linen, horses, and women, besides a proper proportion\r\nof _nod-men_.[110]\r\n\r\nInstances also occur in which the character of the defendant regulated\r\nthe number required. Among the Welsh, the laws of Hoel Dda provide\r\nthat a wife accused of infidelity could disprove a first charge with\r\nseven women; if her conduct provoked a second investigation, she had\r\nto procure fourteen; while, on a third trial, fifty female conjurators\r\nwere requisite for her escape.[111] Another application of the same\r\nprinciple is found in the provision that when a man confessed a\r\nportion of the crime imputed to him and denied the remainder, an\r\naugmented _raith_ was required to support his denial, because it is\r\nmore difficult to believe a man who has admitted his participation in\r\na criminal act. Thus when only fifty men were requisite to rebut a\r\ncharge of homicide, and the accused admitted one of the accessories to\r\nhomicide, his denial of the main charge had to be substantiated by one\r\nhundred, two hundred, or three hundred men, according to the nature\r\nof the case. On the other hand, where no criminal act was concerned,\r\nconfession of a portion diminished the _raith_ for the remainder. Thus\r\nin a claim for suretyship, six compurgators were necessary to the\r\ndefendant; but if he admitted part of the suretyship, his unsupported\r\noath was sufficient to rebut the remainder, as the admission of\r\na portion rendered him worthy of belief.[112] In the Anglo-Saxon\r\njurisprudence, the _frangens jusjurandum_, as it was called, also\r\ngrew to be an exceedingly complex system in the rules by which the\r\nnumber and quality of the conjurators were regulated according to\r\nthe nature of the crime and the rank of the accused. In cases of\r\npeculiar atrocity, such as violation of the sanctity of the grave,\r\nonly thanes were esteemed competent to appear.[113] In fact, among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, the value of a man’s oath was rated according to his\r\nrank, that of a thane, for instance, being equal to those of seven\r\nvilleins.[114] The same peculiarity is observable among the Frisians,\r\nwhose laws required that compurgators should be of the same class as\r\ntheir principal, and the lower his position in the State, the larger\r\nwas the number requisite.[115]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not only the number of compurgators required that\r\naffected the result, but the method by which they were chosen, and this\r\ngave rise to wide variations in practice. Originally, it is probable\r\nthat the selection was left to the accused, who gathered them from\r\namong his kindred. This would lead almost inevitably to his acquittal,\r\nas forcibly pointed out by Hincmar in the ninth century. In objecting\r\nto admit the purgation of an offending priest with ecclesiastics of\r\nhis own choice, he states that evil-minded men combined together to\r\ndefeat justice and secure immunity for their crimes by serving each\r\nother in turn, so that when the accused insisted on offering his\r\ncompanions to the oath, it was necessary to make them undergo the\r\nordeal to prove their sincerity.[116] His expressions indicate that the\r\nquestion of selection at that time was undecided in France, and the\r\nalternative numbers alluded to above show one of the methods adopted to\r\nmeet the evident evils of the process. Other nations devised various\r\nexpedients. The original Lombard law of King Rotharis gave to the\r\nplaintiff the privilege of naming a majority of the compurgators, the\r\nremainder being chosen by the defendant,[117] but even in this the\r\nsolidarity of the family was recognized, since it was the duty of the\r\nplaintiff to select the nearest relatives of his adversary, provided\r\nthey were not personally hostile to the accused.[118] This same spirit\r\nis shown even so late as 1116, in a charter by which Baldwin VII. of\r\nFlanders gratified the citizens of Ypres by substituting among them\r\nthe process of compurgation for the ordeal and battle trial. According\r\nto this, the accuser selected four of the relatives of the accused\r\nto take the purgatorial oath; if they refused through known enmity,\r\nhe was bound to select four other of the kindred, and if none such\r\nwere to be found then four legal men sufficed.[119] The English law\r\nwas the first to educe a rational mode of trial from the absurdity\r\nof the barbaric traditions, and there the process finally assumed\r\na form which occasionally bears a striking resemblance to trial by\r\njury—in fact, it insensibly runs into the latter, to the rise of\r\nwhich it probably contributed. By the laws of Canute, in some cases,\r\nfourteen men were named to the defendant, among whom he was obliged to\r\nfind eleven willing to take the purgatorial oath with him.[120] The\r\nselection of these virtual jurors was probably made by the _gerefa_,\r\nor sheriff;[121] they could be challenged for suspicion of partiality\r\nor other competent cause, and were liable to rejection unless\r\nunexceptionable in every particular.[122] Very similar to this was the\r\n_stockneffn_ of the ancient Danish law, by which, in cases where the\r\nrelatives were not called upon, thirteen men were chosen, a majority\r\nof whom could clear the accused by taking the oath with him. They were\r\nnominated by a person appointed for the purpose, and if the court\r\nneglected this duty, the privilege enured to the plaintiff.[123] More\r\nfacile for the defence was a process prescribed in a Spanish charter\r\nof 1135, where, in cases of homicide, it sufficed for the accused to\r\nobtain five conjurators out of twelve selected by the magistrates.[124]\r\nA method combining selection and chance is described in the custumal of\r\nIpswich in the twelfth century, to decide questions of debt between the\r\ntownsfolk. The party on whom proof was incumbent brought in ten men;\r\nthese were divided into two bands of five each, and a knife was thrown\r\nup between them; the band towards which the point of the knife fell was\r\ntaken, one of the five was set aside, and the remaining four served as\r\nconjurators.[125]\r\n\r\nThe Northern nations were evidently less disposed to favor the\r\naccused than the Southern. In Sweden and Denmark, another regulation\r\nprovides that although the defendant had a right to demand this mode\r\nof purgation, yet the plaintiff had the selection of the twelve men\r\nwho served as conjurators; three of these the accused could challenge\r\nfor enmity, but their places were supplied by the plaintiff.[126] The\r\nevanescent code compiled for Iceland by Haco Haconsen and his son\r\nMagnus, towards the close of the thirteenth century, is more equitable\r\nin its provisions. Though it leaves the nomination of the conjurators\r\nto the defendant, the choice is subject to limitations which placed\r\nit virtually in the power of the court. They were required to be men\r\nof the vicinage, of good repute, peers of the accused, and in no way\r\nconnected with him by blood or other ties.[127] The more lasting code\r\npromulgated at the same time by Magnus for his Norwegian dominions, a\r\ncode which became the common law of Norway for 500 years, provides,\r\nfor cases in which eleven conjurators are required, that seven of them\r\nshall be selected of intelligent men of full age, and in no way related\r\nto the accused, yet residents of the vicinage, and acquainted with the\r\nfacts; the accused can then add four more of good character, himself\r\nmaking the twelfth.[128] We see here, as in the English jurisprudence,\r\nhow nearly the conjuratorial process approaches to the jury-trial, and\r\nhow completely it has departed from its origin in the solidarity of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nSuch care in the selection of those on whom duties so responsible\r\ndevolved did not prevail among the more Southern races at an earlier\r\nage. Among the Lombards slaves and women in tutelage were often\r\nemployed.[129] The Burgundians required that the wife and children, or,\r\nin their absence, the father and mother of the accused should assist\r\nin making up the number of twelve,[130] the object being evidently\r\nto increase the responsibility of the family for the action of its\r\nhead. The abuses of this custom, however, caused its prohibition under\r\nCharlemagne for the reason that it led to the swearing of children\r\nof tender and irresponsible age.[131] That legislator, however,\r\ncontented himself with forbidding those who had once been convicted of\r\nperjury from again appearing either as witnesses or conjurators;[132]\r\nand the little care that was deemed necessary in their selection\r\nunder the Carlovingian jurisprudence is shown by a law of Louis le\r\nDébonnaire ordering that landless freemen should be allowed to serve as\r\nconjurators, though ineligible as witnesses.[133] A truer conception\r\nof the course of justice is manifested, some centuries later, by\r\nthe Béarnese legislation, which required that the _seguidors_ or\r\nconjurators, as well as the _testimonis_ or witnesses should be men\r\nable to pay the amount at stake, together with the fine incurred by\r\nthe losing party,[134] or that they should be fair and loyal men, not\r\nswayed by enmity.[135]\r\n\r\nIn ecclesiastical trials it would seem that the selection of\r\ncompurgators rested with the bishop. In a case occurring in the\r\nthirteenth century, of a priest accused of homicide who failed in\r\nhis compurgation, he appealed to the Holy See on the ground that his\r\naccusers were perjurers and that the bishop had chosen the compurgators\r\nto suit himself.[136] As a matter of course, the result of the trial\r\ndepended, as it does with the modern jury, on the fairness with which\r\nthe choice was made, and in the universal corruption of the middle ages\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that favoritism or bribery was not a\r\ncontrolling influence in a majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF COMPURGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which resort was had to this mode of deciding\r\nlitigation have been the subject of some discussion. It has been\r\nassumed that, in the early period, before the ferocious purity of\r\nthe Barbarians had become adulterated under the influence of Roman\r\ncivilization, it was used in all description of cases, at the option\r\nof the defendant, and was in itself a full and satisfactory proof,\r\nreceived on all hands as equal to any other.[137] The only indication\r\nthat I have met with, among the races of Teutonic stock, tending\r\nto the support of such a conjecture, occurs in the Lombard code,\r\nwhere Rotharis, the earliest compiler of written laws, abolishes a\r\npreviously existing privilege of denying under oath a crime after it\r\nhad been confessed.[138] A much more powerful argument on the other\r\nside, however, is derivable from the earliest text of the Salic law,\r\nto which reference has already been made. In this, the formula shows\r\nclearly that conjurators were only employed in default of other\r\ntestimony;[139] and what lends additional force to the conclusion is\r\nthat this direction disappears in subsequent revisions of the law,\r\nwherein the influences of Christianity and of Roman civilization are\r\nfully apparent. No safe deductions, indeed, can be drawn from mere\r\nomissions to specify that the absence of witnesses was necessary, for\r\nthese ancient codes are drawn up in the rudest manner, and regulations\r\nwhich might safely be presumed to be familiar to every one would not,\r\nin their curt and barbarous sentences, be repeated with the careful\r\nredundancy which marks our modern statutes. Thus there is a passage\r\nin the code of the Alamanni which declares in the most absolute form\r\nthat if a man commits a murder and desires to deny it, he can clear\r\nhimself with twelve conjurators.[140] This, by itself, would authorize\r\nthe assumption that compurgation was allowed to override the clearest\r\nand most convincing testimony, yet it is merely a careless form of\r\nexpression, for another section of the same code expressly provides\r\nthat where a fact is proved by competent witnesses the defendant shall\r\nnot have the privilege of producing compurgators.[141]\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems evident that, even in the earliest times, this\r\nmode of proof was only an expedient resorted to in doubtful matters,\r\nand on the necessity of its use the _rachinborgs_ or judges probably\r\ndecided. A case recorded in the Landnamabok certainly shows that among\r\nthe heathen Norsemen the Godi or priest-judge had this power, for when\r\nThorbiorn Digre prosecuted Thorarin of Mafahlid for horse-stealing, and\r\ndemanded that he should produce twelve conjurators, Arnkell, the Godi,\r\ndecided that the accused might clear himself with his simple oath on\r\nthe holy ring of the altar, and thus the prosecution came to naught\r\nexcept as leading to a bloody feud.[142] That this discretion was\r\nlodged in the court in subsequent times is generally admitted. It is\r\nscarcely worth while to multiply proof; but a few references will show\r\nthe light in which the custom was regarded.[143]\r\n\r\nAs employed by the Church, the rule was distinctly enunciated in the\r\nthirteenth century that the accused was not to be allowed to clear\r\nhimself by canonical purgation when the crime was notorious or when the\r\naccuser offered to prove the charge.[144]\r\n\r\nThe Welsh, however, were exceptional in this respect. The _raith_ was\r\nthe corner-stone of their system of jurisprudence. It was applied to\r\nalmost all actions, whether of civil or criminal law, and even cases of\r\ndoubtful paternity were settled by it, no woman, except one “of bush\r\nand brake” who had no legal kindred, being allowed to give testimony\r\nor take an oath with respect to the paternity of her illegitimate\r\nchild.[145] It excluded and superseded all other procedures. If the\r\naccused declined to take the oath of denial, then testimony on both\r\nsides could be introduced, and the case be settled on the evidence\r\nadduced;[146] but where he chose to abide by the _raith_, the Book of\r\nCynog formally declares that “Evidences are not to be brought as to\r\n_galanas_ [homicide], nor _saraad_ [insults], nor blood, nor wound,\r\nnor ferocious acts, nor waylaying, nor burning buildings, nor theft,\r\nnor surety, nor open assault, nor adultery, nor violence, nor in a\r\ncase where guardians should be, nor in a case where an established\r\nraith is appointed by law; because evidences are not to extinguish a\r\nraith.”[147] Indeed, the only case which I have found wherein it was\r\nrefused is where a priest of the same parish as one accused of theft\r\ntestifies to have seen him in open daylight with the article stolen in\r\nhis possession, when apparently the sacred character of the witness\r\nprecludes a denial on the part of the defendant.[148]\r\n\r\nAmong other races confidence in its ability to supplement absent or\r\ndeficient testimony was manifested in another form—the _juramentum\r\nsupermortuum_—which was employed by various nations, at wide intervals\r\nof time. Thus, in the earliest legislation of the Anglo-Saxons, we\r\nfind that when the defendant or an important witness was dead, the\r\noath which he would have taken or the deposition which he would have\r\nmade was obtained by proceeding to his tomb, where a certain number of\r\nconjurators swore as to what he could or would have done if alive.[149]\r\nTwo centuries later, the same custom is alluded to in the Welsh laws\r\nof Hoel Dda,[150] and even as late as the thirteenth century it was\r\nstill in force throughout Germany.[151] There were other cases in which\r\nevidence of any kind was almost impossible, and in these the wager of\r\nlaw offered a convenient resource. Thus, Frederic II., in 1235, decreed\r\nthat a man harboring an outlaw should himself be outlawed, but he was\r\nallowed to prove with six conjurators that he was ignorant of the\r\noutlawry.[152]\r\n\r\nA remarkable use of conjurators to confirm the evidence of witnesses\r\noccurs in 850 in a dispute between Cantius, Bishop of Siena, and\r\nPeter, Bishop of Arezzo, concerning certain parishes claimed by both.\r\nThe occasion was a solemn one, for it was before a council held in\r\nRome presided over jointly by Pope Leo IV. and the Emperor Louis II.\r\nPeter relied upon written charters, while Cantius produced witnesses.\r\nThe Emperor pronounced the claim of the latter to be just, when he\r\nand twelve priests swore that the oaths of the witnesses were true\r\nand without deceit, whereupon the disputed parishes were adjudged to\r\nhim.[153]\r\n\r\nThe employment of compurgators, however, depended frequently upon the\r\ndegree of crime alleged, or the amount at stake. Thus, in many codes,\r\ntrivial offences or small claims were disposed of by the single oath of\r\nthe defendant, while more important cases required compurgators, whose\r\nnumbers increased with the magnitude of the matter in question. This\r\nprinciple is fairly illustrated in a charter granted to the Venetians\r\nin the year 1111 by Henry V. In suits which involved only the value\r\nof a silver pound, the oath of the party was sufficient; but if the\r\nclaim amounted to twelve pounds or more, then twelve chosen men were\r\nrequisite to substantiate the oath of negation.[154]\r\n\r\nIn England in the thirteenth century we find compurgation very\r\ngenerally employed in the manorial courts for the settlement of petty\r\ncriminal actions. So general was its use, indeed, that it obtained the\r\nname of “law,” as the legal method _par excellence_, and the process\r\nis curtly described in the reports as “facere legem,” “esse ad legem,”\r\n“vadiare legem,” whence is derived the term “wager of law.” The number\r\nof compurgators was generally two or five, and they seem to have been\r\nleft, as a rule, to the choice of the defendant, so that failure to\r\nprocure the requisite number was very unusual.[155]\r\n\r\nIn later times, compurgation was also sometimes used as an alternative\r\nwhen circumstances prevented the employment of other popular modes of\r\ndeciding doubtful cases. Those, for instance, who would ordinarily be\r\nrequired to defend themselves by the wager of battle, were permitted by\r\nsome codes to substitute the oaths of a certain number of conjurators,\r\nwhen precluded by advanced age from appearing in the arena. The burgher\r\nlaw of Scotland affords an example of this,[156] though elsewhere\r\nsuch cases were usually settled by the substitution of champions.\r\nClass privileges also manifested themselves in this as in so many\r\nother features of mediæval law, and we sometimes find compurgation\r\nallowed as a favor to those of gentle birth. Thus, in the Council of\r\nReims in 1119, among the provisions for the enforcement of the Truce\r\nof God, accusations of its violation are rebutted by knights with\r\nsix compurgators, while common people are required to undergo the\r\nordeal.[157]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFORMULAS AND PROCEDURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive lawgivers were too chary of words in their skeleton codes\r\nto embody in them the formula usually employed for the compurgatorial\r\noath. We have therefore no positive evidence of its nature in the\r\nearliest times; but as the forms made use of by several races at a\r\nsomewhat later period have been preserved, and as they resemble each\r\nother in all essential respects, we may reasonably assume that little\r\nvariation had previously occurred. The most ancient that I have met\r\nwith occurs in an Anglo-Saxon formulary which is supposed to date\r\nfrom about A. D. 900: “By the Lord, the oath is clean and unperjured\r\nwhich N. has sworn.”[158] A century later, in a compilation of the\r\nLombard law, it appears: “That which the accused has sworn is true, so\r\nhelp me God.”[159] The form specified in Béarn, at a period somewhat\r\nsubsequent, is curt and decisive: “By these saints, he tells the\r\ntruth;”[160] while the code in force in Normandy until the sixteenth\r\ncentury directs an oath identical in spirit: “The oath which William\r\nhas sworn is true, so help me God and his saints.”[161] It will be\r\nobserved that all these, while essentially distinct from the oath\r\nof a witness, are still unqualified assertions of the truth of the\r\nprincipal, and not mere asseverations of belief or protestations of\r\nconfidence. The earliest departure from this positive affirmation,\r\nin secular jurisprudence, occurs in the unsuccessful attempt at\r\nlegislation for Norway and Iceland by Haco Haconsen in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. In this, the impropriety of such oaths is pointed out, and\r\nit is directed that in future the compurgator shall swear only,\r\nin confirmation of his principal, that he knows nothing to the\r\ncontrary.[162] In the similar code promulgated in 1274 by his son\r\nMagnus in Norway, it is directed that the accused shall take a full\r\noath of denial, and the conjurators shall swear in the same words that\r\nhis oath is true, and that they know nothing truer.[163]\r\n\r\nWe shall see that, before the custom fell into total disuse, the\r\nchange which Haco vainly attempted, came to be generally adopted, in\r\nconsequence, principally, of the example set by the church. Even before\r\nthis was formally promulgated by the Popes, however, ecclesiastics\r\noccasionally showed that they were more careful as to what they swore,\r\nand at a comparatively early period they introduced the form of merely\r\nasserting their belief in the oath taken by their principal. Thus, in\r\n1101, we find two bishops endeavoring to relieve a brother prelate from\r\na charge of simony, and their compurgatorial oath ventures no further\r\nthan “So help me God, I believe that Norgaud, Bishop of Autun, has\r\nsworn the truth.”[164]\r\n\r\nIn the form of oath, however, as well as in so many other particulars,\r\nthe Welsh had a more complicated system, peculiar to themselves. The\r\nordinary _raith-man_ only was required to take an oath “that it appears\r\nmost likely to him that what he swears to is true.” In many aggravated\r\ncrimes, however, a certain proportion, generally one-half, had to be\r\n_nod-men_ who were bound to a more stringent form, as the law specifies\r\nthat “the oath of a nod-man is, to be in accordance with what is sworn\r\nby the criminal.”[165] The difference, as we have seen, in the numbers\r\nrequired when a portion were _nod-men_ shows how much more difficult\r\nit was to find men willing to swear to an absolute denial, and how\r\nmuch more weight was attached to such a declaration than to the lax\r\nexpression of opinion contained in the ordinary oath of the _raith-man_.\r\n\r\nVariations are likewise observable in the form of administering the\r\noath. Among the Alamanni, for instance, the compurgators laid their\r\nhands upon the altar, and the principal placed his hand over the\r\nothers, repeating the oath alone;[166] while among the Lombards, a\r\nlaw of the Emperor Lothair directs that each shall take the oath\r\nseparately.[167] It was always, however, administered in a consecrated\r\nplace, before delegates appointed by the judges trying the cause,\r\nsometimes on the altar and sometimes on relics. In the Welsh laws\r\nof the fifteenth century it is specified that all _raiths_ shall be\r\nadministered in the parish church of the defendant, before the priest\r\nshall have disrobed or distributed the sacramental bread.[168] At an\r\nearlier period a formula of Marculfus specifies the Capella S. Martini,\r\nor cope of St. Martin,[169] one of the most venerated relics of the\r\nroyal chapel, whence we may perhaps conclude that it was habitually\r\nused for that purpose in the business of the royal Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the universality of the custom, and the absolute\r\ncharacter of the decisions reached by the process, it is easy to\r\ndiscern that the confidence reposed in it was of a very qualified\r\ncharacter, even at an early period. The primitive law of the Frisians\r\ndescribes some whimsical proceedings, prescribed for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the responsibility for a homicide committed in a crowd.\r\nThe accuser was at liberty to select seven from among the participants\r\nof the brawl, and each of these was obliged to deny the crime with\r\ntwelve conjurators. This did not absolve them, however, for each of\r\nthem was also individually subjected to the ordeal, which finally\r\ndecided as to his guilt or innocence. In this, the value of the\r\ncompurgation was reduced to that of the merest technical ceremony,\r\nand yet a failure to procure the requisite number of supporters was\r\ntantamount to a conviction, while, to crown the absurdity of the whole,\r\nif any one succumbed in the ordeal, his conjurators were punished as\r\nperjurers.[170] A similar want of confidence in the principle involved\r\nis shown by a reference in the Anglo-Saxon laws to the conjurators\r\nof an accused party being outsworn (_overcythed_), when recourse was\r\nlikewise had to the ordeal.[171] Among the heathen Norsemen, indeed,\r\nan offer by either party to produce conjurators could always be met by\r\nthe antagonist with a challenge to the duel, which at once superseded\r\nall other proceedings.[172] As regards the church, although the\r\nauthoritative use of compurgation among ecclesiastics would seem to\r\ndemand for it among them implicit faith in its results, yet we have\r\nalready seen that, in the ninth century, Hincmar did not hesitate to\r\nrequire that in certain cases it should be confirmed by the ordeal;\r\nand two centuries later, a remark of Ivo of Chartres implies a\r\nstrong degree of doubt as to its efficacy. In relating that Sanctio,\r\nBishop-elect of Orleans, when accused of simony by a disappointed\r\nrival, took the oath of negation with seven compurgators, he adds\r\nthat the accused thus cleared himself as far as he could in the eyes\r\nof man.[173] That the advantages it offered to the accused were duly\r\nappreciated, both by criminals and judges, is evident from the case of\r\nManasses, Archbishop of Reims. Charged with simony and other offences,\r\nafter numerous tergiversations he was finally summoned for trial\r\nbefore the Council of Lyons, in 1080. As a last effort to escape the\r\nimpending doom, he secretly offered to Bishop Hugh, the Papal legate,\r\nthe enormous sum of two hundred ounces of gold and other presents in\r\nhand, besides equally liberal prospective payments, if he could obtain\r\nthe privilege of compurgation with six suffragan bishops. Gregory VII.\r\nwas then waging too uncompromising a war with the corroding abuse of\r\nsimony for his lieutenant to yield to any bribe, however dazzling; the\r\nproffer was spurned, Manasses confessed his guilt by absence, and was\r\naccordingly deposed.[174] Incidents like this, however, did not destroy\r\nconfidence in the system, for, some sixty years later, we find Innocent\r\nII. ordering the Bishop of Trent, when similarly accused of simony,\r\nto clear himself with the oaths of two bishops and three abbots or\r\nmonks.[175]\r\n\r\nThe comparative value attached to the oaths of conjurators is\r\nillustrated by the provisions which are occasionally met with,\r\nregulating the cases in which they were employed in default of\r\nwitnesses, or in opposition to them. Thus, in the Baioarian law, the\r\noath of one competent witness is considered to outweigh those of six\r\nconjurators;[176] and among the Lombards, an accusation of murder which\r\ncould be met with three witnesses required twelve conjurators as a\r\nsubstitute.[177]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that conjurators were in no sense witnesses,\r\nthat they were not expected to give testimony, and that they merely\r\nexpressed their confidence in the veracity of their principal. It may\r\nconsequently at first sight appear somewhat unreasonable that they\r\nshould be held guilty of perjury and subject to its penalties in case\r\nof unluckily sustaining the wrong side of a cause. It is probably\r\nowing to this apparent injustice that some writers have denied that\r\nthey were involved in the guilt of their principal, and among others\r\nthe learned Meyer has fallen into this error.[178] The proof, however,\r\nis too clear for dispute. We have already seen that the oath was an\r\nunqualified assertion of the justice of the side espoused, without\r\nreservation justifying the escape of the compurgators from the charge\r\nof false swearing, and one or two incidental references have been made\r\nto the punishments inflicted on them when subsequently convicted of\r\nperjury. The code of the Alamanni recognized the guilt involved in\r\nsuch cases when it denied the privilege of compurgation to any one who\r\nhad previously been more than once convicted of crime, giving as a\r\nreason the desire to save innocent persons from incurring the sin of\r\nperjury.[179] Similar evidence is derived from a regulation promulgated\r\nby King Liutprand in the Lombard Law, by which a man nominated as a\r\nconjurator, and declining to serve, was obliged to swear that he dared\r\nnot take the oath for fear of his soul.[180] A case in point occurs in\r\nthe life of St. Boniface, whose fellow-laborer Adalger in dying left\r\nhis property to the church. The graceless brothers of the deceased\r\ndisputed the bequest, and offered to make good their claim to the\r\nestate by the requisite number of oaths. The holy man ordered them to\r\nswear alone, in order not to be concerned in the destruction of their\r\nconjurators, and on their unsupported oaths gave up the property.[181]\r\n\r\nThe law had no hesitation in visiting such cases with the penalties\r\nreserved for perjury. By the Salic code unlucky compurgators were\r\nheavily fined.[182] Among the Frisians, they had to buy themselves off\r\nfrom punishment by the amount of their _wer-gild_—the value set upon\r\ntheir heads.[183] A slight relaxation of this severity is manifested\r\nin the Carlovingian legislation, by which they were punished with the\r\nloss of a hand—the customary penalty of perjury—unless they could\r\nestablish, by undergoing the ordeal, that they had taken the oath in\r\nignorance of the facts; but even in trifling causes a defeated litigant\r\ncould accuse his own conjurator of perjury, when both parties were\r\nsent to the ordeal of the cross, and if the conjurator broke down\r\nhe lost a hand.[184] So late as the close of the twelfth century,\r\nwe find Celestin III. ordering the employment of conjurators in a\r\nclass of cases about the facts of which they could not possibly know\r\nanything, and decreeing that if the event proved them to be in error\r\nthey were to be punished for perjury.[185] That such liability was\r\nfully recognized at this period is shown by the argument of Aliprandus\r\nof Milan, a celebrated contemporary legist, who, in maintaining the\r\nposition that an ordinary witness committing perjury must always lose\r\nhis hand, without the privilege of redeeming it, adds that no witness\r\ncan perjure himself unintentionally; but that conjurators may do so\r\neither knowingly or unknowingly, that they are therefore entitled to\r\nthe benefit of the doubt, and if not wittingly guilty, that they should\r\nhave the privilege of redeeming their hands.[186]\r\n\r\nAll this seems in the highest degree irrational, yet in criticising the\r\nhardships to which innocent conjurators were thus exposed, it should\r\nbe borne in mind that the whole system had become a solecism. In its\r\norigin, it was simply summoning the kinsmen together to bear the brunt\r\nof the court, as they were bound to bear that of battle; and as they\r\nwere liable for a portion of the fine which was the penalty of all\r\ncrimes—personal punishments for freemen being unknown—they could well\r\nafford to incur the risk of paying for perjury in order to avoid the\r\nassessment to be levied upon them in case of the conviction of their\r\nrelative. In subsequent periods, when the family responsibility became\r\nweakened or disused, and the progress of civilization rendered the\r\ninterests of society more complex, the custom could only be retained\r\nby making the office one not to be lightly undertaken. A man who was\r\nendeavoring to defend himself from a probable charge of murder, or who\r\ndesired to confirm his possession of an estate against a competitor\r\nwith a fair show of title, was expected to produce guarantees that\r\nwould carry conviction to the minds of impartial men. As long as the\r\npractice existed, it was therefore necessary to invest it with every\r\nsolemnity, and to guard it with penalties that would obviate some of\r\nits disadvantages.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find that it was not always a matter of course for a\r\nman to clear himself in this manner. The ancient codes have frequent\r\nprovisions for the fine incurred by those unable to procure the\r\nrequisite number of compurgators, showing that it was an occurrence\r\nconstantly kept in mind by legislators. Nor was it only landless and\r\nfriendless men who were exposed to such failures. In 794, a certain\r\nBishop Peter was condemned by the Synod of Frankfort to clear himself,\r\nwith two or three conjurators, of the suspicion of being involved in a\r\nconspiracy against Charlemagne, and, small as was the number, he was\r\nunable to procure them.[187] So, in the year 1100, when the canons\r\nof Autun, at the Council of Poitiers, accused their bishop, Norgaud,\r\nof simony and other irregular practices, and he proposed to absolve\r\nhimself with the compurgatorial oaths of the Archbishop of Tours and\r\nthe Bishop of Rédon, the canons went privately to those prelates and\r\nthreatened that in such event they would bring an accusation of perjury\r\nand prove it by the ordeal of fire, whereupon the would-be conjurators\r\nwisely abandoned their intention, and Norgaud was suspended.[188] I\r\nhave already referred (p. 51) to a case before the Papal Penitentiary\r\nabout 1240, in which a priest accused of homicide was put upon his\r\npurgation and failed, whereupon his bishop deprived him of function and\r\nbenefice, and he hastened to Rome with a complaint that the bishop had\r\nnot been impartial in the selection of compurgators. The most rigid\r\ncompliance with the requisitions of the law was exacted. Thus the\r\nstatutes of Nieuport, in 1163, provide a heavy penalty, and in addition\r\npronounce condemnation, when a single one of the conjurators declines\r\nthe oath.[189] It goes without saying that failure in compurgation was\r\nequivalent to conviction or confession.[190]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF COMPURGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a system of which the fundamental principle was so vicious, the best\r\nefforts of legislation could prove but a slight palliation, and from\r\nan early period we find efforts made for its abrogation or limitation.\r\nIn 983, a constitution of Otho II. abolished it in cases of contested\r\nestates, and substituted the wager of battle, on account of the\r\nenormous perjury which it occasioned.[191] In England, a more sweeping\r\ndenunciation, declaring its abolition and replacing it with the vulgar\r\nordeal, is found in the confused and contradictory compilation known as\r\nthe laws of Henry I.[192]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, from instances of later date, how little\r\ninfluence these efforts had in eradicating a custom so deeply rooted in\r\nthe ancestral prejudices of all the European races. The hold which it\r\ncontinued to enjoy on the popular confidence is well illustrated by the\r\noath which, according to the Romancero, was exacted of Alfonso VI. of\r\nCastile, by the Cid to clear him of suspicion of privity to the death\r\nof his brother and predecessor Sancho II. at the siege of Zamora,\r\nwhere he was slain by Bellido Delfos—\r\n\r\n    “Que nos fagays juramento\r\n    Qual vos lo querrán tomar,\r\n    Vos y doce de los vuesos,\r\n    Quales vos querays juntar,\r\n    Que de la muerte del Rey\r\n    Non tenedes que culpar....\r\n    Ni tampoco della os plugo,\r\n    Ni a ella distes lugar.”[193]\r\n\r\nThe same reliance on its efficacy is shown in a little ballad by\r\nAudefroi-le-Bâtard, a renowned _trouvère_ of the twelfth century:—\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BELLE EREMBORS.[194]\r\n\r\n“Quand vient en mai, que l’on dit as lons jors,” etc.\r\n\r\n    In the long bright days of spring-time,\r\n      In the month of blooming May,\r\n    The Franks from royal council field\r\n      All homeward wend their way.\r\n    Rinaldo leads them onward,\r\n      Past Erembors’ gray tower,\r\n    But turns away, nor deigns to look\r\n      Up to the maiden’s bower.\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\n    Full in her turret window\r\n      Fair Erembors is sitting,\r\n    The love-lorn tales of knights and dames\r\n      In many a color knitting.\r\n    She sees the Franks pass onward,\r\n      Rinaldo at their head,\r\n    And fain would clear the slanderous tale\r\n      That evil tongues have spread.\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\n    “Sir knight, I well remember\r\n      When you had grieved to see\r\n    The castle of old Erembors\r\n      Without a smile from me.”\r\n    “Your vows are broken, princess,\r\n      Your faith is light as air,\r\n    Your love another’s, and of mine\r\n      You have nor reck nor care.”\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\n    “Sir knight, my faith unbroken,\r\n      On relics I will swear;\r\n    A hundred maids and thirty dames\r\n      With me the oath shall share.\r\n    I’ve never loved another,\r\n      From stain my vows are free.\r\n    If this content your doubts and fears,\r\n      You shall have kisses three.”\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\n    Rinaldo mounts the staircase,\r\n      A goodly knight, I ween,\r\n    With shoulders broad and slender waist,\r\n      Fair hair and blue eyes keen.\r\n    Earth holds no youth more gifted\r\n      In every knightly measure;\r\n    When Erembors beholds him,\r\n      She weeps with very pleasure.\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\n    Rinaldo in the turret\r\n      Upon a couch reposes,\r\n    Where deftly limned are mimic wreaths\r\n      Of violets and of roses.\r\n    Fair Erembors beside him\r\n      Sits clasped in loving hold,\r\n    And in their eyes and lips they find\r\n      The love they vowed of old!\r\n                      Ah, dear Rinaldo!\r\n\r\nIn England, although as we have seen (p. 57), the wager of law was the\r\ncustomary resource of the manorial courts in disputed questions, the\r\nshrewd and intelligent lawyers who were building up and systematizing\r\nthe practice of the royal courts were disposed to limit it as much as\r\npossible in criminal cases. Towards the close of the twelfth century,\r\nGlanville compiled his excellent little treatise “De legibus Angliæ,”\r\nthe first satisfactory body of legal procedure which the history of\r\nmediæval jurisprudence affords. Complete as this is in all the forms\r\nof prosecution and defence, the allusions to conjurators are so slight\r\nas to show that already they were employed rather on collateral\r\npoints than on main questions. Thus a defendant who desired to deny\r\nthe serving of a writ could swear to its non-reception with twelve\r\nconjurators;[195] and a party to a suit, who had made an unfortunate\r\nstatement or admission in court, could deny it by bringing forward\r\ntwo to swear with him against the united recollections and records\r\nof the whole court.[196] The custom, however, still maintained its\r\nhold on popular confidence. In 1194, when Richard I. undertook,\r\nafter his liberation, to bring about a reconciliation between his\r\nchancellor William, Bishop of Ely, and the Archbishop of York, one of\r\nthe conditions was that the chancellor should swear with a hundred\r\npriestly compurgators that he had neither caused nor desired the arrest\r\nof the archbishop.[197] In the next century Bracton alludes to the\r\nemployment of conjurators in cases of disputed feudal service between a\r\nlord and his vassal, wherein the utmost exactness was rigidly required\r\nboth as to the number and fitness of the conjurators,[198] and we shall\r\nsee that no formal abrogation of it took place until the nineteenth\r\ncentury. An outgrowth of the custom, moreover, was the Inquest of\r\nFame, by which “the general character of the accused, as found by a\r\njury, was accepted as an indication of the guilt or innocence of the\r\nprisoner.”[199]\r\n\r\nSoon after the time of Glanville, the system of compurgation received\r\na severe shock from its most important patron, the church. As stated\r\nabove, in proceedings between ecclesiastics, it was everywhere received\r\nas the appropriate mode of deciding doubtful cases. At the same time\r\nthe absolute character of the compurgatorial oath was too strong an\r\nincentive to perjury, ignorant or wilful, for conscientious minds to\r\nreconcile themselves to the practice, and efforts commenced to modify\r\nit. About 1130 Innocent II., in prescribing compurgation for the Bishop\r\nof Trent, accused of simony, orders that the oath of the conjurators\r\nshall be simply as to their belief in the bishop’s oath.[200] Gratian\r\ninserted this in his _Decretum_, and a commentator soon afterwards\r\nspeaks of it as an opinion held by some authorities.[201] It was\r\nreserved for Innocent III. to give this the full sanction of law as\r\na general regulation. Compurgation was too valuable a resource for\r\nchurchmen to be discarded, and he endeavored to check the abuses\r\nto which it led, by demanding conjurators of good character, whose\r\nintimacy with the accused would give weight to their oaths.[202] At\r\nthe same time, in endeavoring to remove one of the objections to its\r\nuse, he in reality destroyed one of its principal titles to respect,\r\nfor in decreeing that compurgators should only be obliged to swear to\r\ntheir belief in the truth of the principal’s oath,[203] he attacked the\r\nvery foundation of the practice, and gave a powerful impulse to the\r\ntendency of the times no longer to consider the compurgator as sharing\r\nthe guilt or innocence of the accused. Such an innovation could only be\r\nregarded as withdrawing the guarantee which had immemorially existed.\r\nTo recognize it as a legal precept was to deprive the proceeding of its\r\nsolemnity and to render it no longer a security worthy the confidence\r\nof the people or sufficient to occupy the attention of a court of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion arising from the long and varying contest as to the\r\nboundaries of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it is not easy to\r\ndetermine the exact influence which this decretal may have exercised\r\ndirectly in secular jurisprudence. We have seen above that the ancient\r\nform of absolute oath was still employed without change until long\r\nafter this period, but the moral effect of so decided a declaration\r\nfrom the head of the Christian church could not but be great. Another\r\ninfluence, not less potent, was also at work. The revival of the\r\nstudy of the Roman jurisprudence, dating from about the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century, soon began to exhibit the results which were to\r\nwork so profound a change in the legal maxims and principles of half\r\nof Europe.[204] The criminal procedure of the Barbarians had rested\r\nto a great degree on the system of negative proofs. In the absence of\r\npositive evidence of guilt, and sometimes in despite of it, the accused\r\nwas bound to clear himself by compurgation or by the ordeal. The\r\ncooler and less impassioned justice of the Roman law saw clearly the\r\nfutility of such attempts, and its system was based on the indisputable\r\nmaxim that it is morally impossible to prove a negative—unless, indeed,\r\nthat negative should chance to be incompatible with some affirmative\r\nsusceptible of evidence—and thus the onus of proof was thrown upon the\r\naccuser.[205] The civil lawyers were not long in recognizing the truth\r\nof this principle, and in proclaiming it far and wide. The Spanish code\r\nof Alfonso the Wise, in the middle of the thirteenth century, asserts\r\nit in almost the same words as the Roman jurisconsult.[206] Not long\r\nbefore, the Assises de Jerusalem had unequivocally declared that “nul\r\nne peut faire preuve de non;” and Beaumanoir, in the _Coutumes du\r\nBeauvoisis_, approvingly quotes the assertion of the civil doctors to\r\nthe same effect, “Li clerc si dient et il dient voir, que negative ne\r\ndoit pas quevir en proeve.”\r\n\r\nAbstract principles, however, though freely admitted, were not yet\r\npowerful enough to eradicate traditional customs rooted deeply in\r\nthe feelings and prejudices of the age. The three bodies of law just\r\ncited contradict their own admissions, in retaining with more or less\r\ncompleteness the most monstrous of negative proofs—the ordeal of\r\nbattle—and the introduction of torture soon after exposed the accused\r\nto the chances of the negative system in its most atrocious form.\r\nStill these codes show a marked progress as relates to the kindred\r\nprocedure of compurgation. The Partidas, promulgated about 1262,\r\nrecord the convictions of an enlightened ruler as to what should be\r\nlaw rather than the existing institutions of a people, and were not\r\naccepted as authoritative until the middle of the fourteenth century.\r\nThe absence of compurgation in Spain, moreover, was a direct legacy\r\nfrom the Wisigothic code, transmitted in regular descent through the\r\nFuero Juzgo.[207] The Assises de Jerusalem is a more precious relic\r\nof mediæval jurisprudence. Constructed as a code for the government\r\nof the Latin kingdoms of the East, in 1099, by order of Godfrey of\r\nBouillon, it has reached us only in the form assumed about the period\r\nunder consideration, and as it presents the combined experience of\r\nthe warriors of many Western races, its silence on the subject of\r\nconjurators is not a little significant. The work of Beaumanoir,\r\nwritten in 1283, is not only the most perfect embodiment of the\r\nFrench jurisprudence of his time, but is peculiarly interesting as a\r\nlandmark in the struggle between the waning power of feudalism and\r\nthe Roman theories which gave intensity of purpose to the enlightened\r\ncentralization aimed at by St. Louis: and Beaumanoir likewise passes\r\nin silence over the practice of compurgation, as though it were no\r\nlonger an existing institution. All these legislators and lawyers had\r\nbeen preceded by the Emperor Frederic II., who, in 1231, promulgated\r\nhis “Constitutiones Sicularum” for the government of his Neapolitan\r\nprovinces. Frederic was Latin, and not Teutonic, both by education and\r\npredilection, and his system of jurisprudence is greatly in advance of\r\nall that had preceded it. That conjurators should find no place in his\r\nscheme of legal procedure is, therefore, only what might be expected.\r\nThe collection of laws known as the _Êtablissements_ of St. Louis is\r\nby no means a complete code, but it is sufficiently copious to render\r\nthe absence of all allusion to compurgation significant. In fact, the\r\nnumerous references to the Digest show how strong was the desire to\r\nsubstitute the Roman for the customary law, and the efforts of the king\r\nto do away with all negative proofs of course included the one under\r\nconsideration. The same may be said of the _Livres de Jostice et de\r\nPlet_ and the _Conseil_ of Pierre de Fontaines, two unofficial books\r\nof practice, which represent with tolerable fulness the procedures\r\nin vogue during the latter half of the thirteenth century; while the\r\n_Olim_, or records of the Parlement of Paris, the king’s high court\r\nof justice, show that the same principles were kept in view in the\r\nlong struggle by which that body succeeded in extending the royal\r\njurisdiction at the expense of the independence of the vainly resisting\r\nfeudatories. In the _Olim_ from 1254 to 1318, I can find but two\r\ninstances in which compurgation was required—one in 1279 at Noyon, and\r\none in 1284 at Compiègne. As innumerable decisions are given of cases\r\nin which its employment would have been equally appropriate, these two\r\ncan only be regarded as exceptional, and the inference is fair that\r\nsome local custom rendered it impossible to refuse the privilege on\r\nthese special occasions.[208]\r\n\r\nAll these were the works of men deeply imbued with the spirit of the\r\nresuscitated jurisconsults of Rome. Their labors bear testimony rather\r\nto the influences tending to overthrow the institutions bequeathed by\r\nthe Barbarians to the Middle Ages, than to a general acceptance of\r\nthe innovations attempted. Their authority was still circumscribed\r\nby the innumerable jurisdictions which yet defied their gradual\r\nencroachments and resolutely maintained ancestral customs. Thus, in\r\n1250, we find in the settlement of a quarrel between Hugues Tirel\r\nSeigneur of Poix in Picardy and the commune of that place, that one\r\nof the articles was to the effect that the mayor with thirty-nine of\r\nthe bourgeois should kneel before the dame de Poix and offer to swear\r\nthat an insult inflicted on her had not been done, or that if it had,\r\nit had been in honor of the Seigneur de Poix.[209] Even an occasional\r\ninstance may be found where the central power itself permitted the\r\nuse of compurgation, showing how difficult it was to eradicate the\r\nprejudices transmitted through ages from father to son, and that the\r\npolicy adopted by St. Louis and Philippe le Bel, aided by the shrewd\r\nand energetic civil lawyers who assisted them so ably, was not in all\r\ncases adhered to. Thus, in 1283, when the bailli of Amiens was accused\r\nbefore the Parlement of Paris of having invaded the privileges of the\r\nchurch by trying three clerks accused of crime, it was decided that\r\nhe should swear with six compurgators as to his ignorance that the\r\ncriminals were ecclesiastics.[210] So, in 1303, a powerful noble of\r\nthe court of Philippe le Bel was accused of a foul and treacherous\r\nmurder, which a brother of the victim offered to prove by the wager\r\nof battle. Philippe was endeavoring to abolish the judicial duel, and\r\nthe accused desired strongly to escape that ordeal. He was accordingly\r\ncondemned to clear himself of the imputed crime by a purgatorial oath\r\nwith ninety-nine nobles, and at the same time to satisfy the fraternal\r\nclaim of vengeance with an enormous fine[211]—a decision which offers\r\nthe best practical commentary on the degree of faith reposed in this\r\nsystem of purgation. Even the Parlement of Paris in 1353 and a rescript\r\nof Charles le Sage in 1357 allude to compurgation as still in use and\r\nof binding force.[212]\r\n\r\nIt was in the provinces, however, that the system manifested its\r\ngreatest vitality, protected both by the stubborn dislike to\r\ninnovation and by the spirit of independence which so long and so\r\nbitterly resisted the centralizing efforts of the crown. The Roman law\r\nconcentrated all power in the person of the sovereign, and reduced his\r\nsubjects to one common level of implicit obedience. The genius of the\r\nbarbaric institutions and of feudalism localized power. The principles\r\nwere essentially oppugnant, and the contest between them was prolonged\r\nand confused, for neither party could in all cases recognize the\r\nultimate result of the minuter points involved, though each was fully\r\nalive to the broad issues of the struggle.\r\n\r\nHow obstinate was the attachment to bygone forms may be understood\r\nwhen we see even the comparatively precocious civilization of a city\r\nlike Lille preserve the compurgatorial oath as a regular procedure\r\nuntil the middle of the fourteenth century, even though the progress of\r\nenlightenment had long rendered it a mere formality, without serious\r\nmeaning. Until the year 1351, the defendant in a civil suit was obliged\r\nto substantiate the oath of denial with two conjurators of the same\r\nsex, who swore to its truth, to the best of their belief.[213] The\r\nminutest regulations were enforced as to this ceremony, the position\r\nof every finger being determined by law, and though it was the veriest\r\nformality, serving merely as an introduction to the taking of testimony\r\nand the legal examination of the case, yet the slightest error\r\ncommitted by either party lost him the suit irrecoverably.[214]\r\n\r\nNormandy was even more faithful to the letter of the ancient\r\ntraditions. The Coutumier in use until the revision of 1583 under Henry\r\nIII. retains a remnant of the practice under the name of _desrene_, by\r\nwhich, in questions of little moment, a man could rebut an accusation\r\nwith two or four compurgators, even when it was sustained by witnesses.\r\nThe form of procedure was identical with that of old, and the oath,\r\nas we have already seen (page 58), was an unqualified assertion of\r\nthe truth of that of the accused.[215] Practically, however, we may\r\nassume that the custom had become obsolete, for the letters patent of\r\nHenry III., ordering the revision in 1577, expressly state that the\r\nprovisions of the existing laws “estoient la pluspart hors d’usage et\r\npeu ou point entendu des habitants du pays;” and that compurgation was\r\none of the forgotten formulas may fairly be inferred from the fact that\r\nPasquier, writing previous to 1584, speaks of it as altogether a matter\r\nof the past.[216]\r\n\r\nThe fierce mountaineers of Béarn were comparatively inaccessible to the\r\ninnovating spirit of the age, and preserved their feudal independence\r\namid the progress and reform of the sixteenth century long after it\r\nhad become obsolete elsewhere throughout Southern Europe. Accordingly,\r\nwe find the practice of compurgation maintained as a regular form of\r\nprocedure in the latest revision of their code, made by Henry II.\r\nof Navarre in 1551, which continued in force until the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[217] The influence of the age is shown, however, even there,\r\nin a modification of the oath, which is no longer an unreserved\r\nconfirmation of the principal, but a mere affirmation of belief.[218]\r\n\r\nIn Castile, a revival of the custom is to be found in the code\r\ncompiled by Pedro the Cruel, in 1356, by which, in certain cases,\r\nthe defendant was allowed to prove his innocence with the oath of\r\neleven hidalgos.[219] This, however, is so much in opposition to\r\nthe principles of the Partidas, which had but a few years previous\r\nbeen accepted as the law of the land, and is so contrary to the\r\nspirit of the Ordenamiento de Alcalà, which continued in force until\r\nthe fifteenth century, that it can only be regarded as a tentative\r\nresuscitation of mere temporary validity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Northern races resisted more obdurately the advances of the\r\nreviving influence of the Roman law. Though we have seen Frederic\r\nII. omitting all notice of compurgation in the code prepared for his\r\nNeapolitan dominions in 1231, he did not attempt to abrogate it among\r\nhis German subjects, for it is alluded to in a charter granted to the\r\ncity of Regensburg in 1230.[220] The Schwabenspiegel, which during the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries was the municipal law of Southern\r\nGermany, directs the employment of conjurators in various classes of\r\nactions which do not admit of direct testimony.[221] The code in force\r\nin Northern Germany, as we have already seen, gave great facilities\r\nfor rebutting accusations by the single oath of the defendant, and\r\ntherefore the use of conjurators is but rarely referred to in the\r\nSachsenspiegel, though it was not unknown, for either of the parties to\r\na judicial duel could refuse the combat by procuring six conjurators\r\nto swear with him that he was related to his antagonist.[222] In the\r\nSaxon burgher law, however, the practice is frequently alluded to, and\r\nit would seem from various passages that a man of good character who\r\ncould get six others to take with him the oath of denial was not easily\r\nconvicted. But where there was satisfactory proof, compurgation was not\r\nallowed, and in homicide cases, if a relative of the slain decided to\r\nproceed by the duel, his claim of vengeance was supreme, and no other\r\nprocess was admissible.[223] It is evident, however, that compurgation\r\nretained its hold on popular respect when we see, about 1300, the\r\nEmperor Albert I. substituting it for the duel in a considerable class\r\nof criminal cases.[224] In the early part of the sixteenth century,\r\nMaximilian I. did much to diminish the use of the compurgatorial\r\nprocedure,[225] but that he failed to eradicate it entirely is\r\nevident from a constitution issued by Charles V. in 1548, wherein its\r\nemployment is enjoined in doubtful cases in a manner to show that it\r\nwas an existing resource of the law, and that it retained its hold upon\r\npublic confidence, although the conjurators were only required to swear\r\nas to their belief in the oath of their principal.[226]\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands it likewise maintained its position. Damhouder,\r\nwriting in 1554, after describing its employment in the Courts\r\nChristian, adds that by their example it was occasionally used also in\r\nsecular tribunals.[227]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, as late as the middle of the fourteenth century, its\r\nexistence is proved by a statute which provides that if a thief escaped\r\nfrom confinement, the lord of the prison should clear himself of\r\ncomplicity with the evasion by the oaths of thirty conjurators, of whom\r\nthree were required to be nobles.[228]\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian nations adhered to the custom with even greater\r\ntenacity. In the code of Haco Haconsen, issued towards the close\r\nof the thirteenth century, it appears as the basis of defensive\r\nprocedure in almost all criminal cases, and even in civil suits its\r\nemployment is not infrequently directed, the number of conjurators\r\nbeing proportioned to the nature of the crime or to the amount at\r\nstake, and regulations for administering the oath being given with much\r\nminuteness.[229] In Denmark it was not abolished until near the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, under Christiern IV., after it had become\r\na crying abuse through the habit of members of families, and even of\r\nwhole guilds, entering into formal engagements to support each other\r\nin this manner.[230] The exact date of its abrogation is a matter of\r\nuncertainty, and the stubbornness with which the people clung to it is\r\nshown by the fact that even in 1683 Christiern V., in promulgating a\r\nnew code, found it necessary formally to prohibit accused persons from\r\nbeing forced to provide conjurators.[231] In Sweden, its existence\r\nwas similarly prolonged. Directions for its use are contained in the\r\ncode which was in force until the seventeenth century;[232] it is\r\nconstantly alluded to in the laws of Gustavus Adolphus;[233] and an\r\nedict of Charles XI. in 1662 reproves the readiness with which men\r\nwere everywhere prompt to serve as compurgators, and requires the\r\njudges, before admitting them, to investigate whether they are proper\r\npersons and what are their reasons to believe in the innocence of their\r\nprincipal.[234] By this time, therefore, though not yet witnesses, they\r\nwere becoming assimilated to them.\r\n\r\nThe vitality of communal societies among the Slavs naturally led\r\nto the maintenance of a custom which drew its origin from the\r\nsolidarity of families, and it is therefore not surprising to find\r\nit in Poland described as in full force as late as the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the defendant being obliged to support his purgatorial oath\r\nwith conjurators, who swore as to its truth.[235] Yet among the\r\nPoles confidence in it as a legal proof had long been undermined. In\r\n1368 Casimir III. decreed that a man of good repute, when accused of\r\ntheft, could clear himself by his own oath; but if his character was\r\ndoubtful, and compurgation was prescribed, then if he fell short by\r\none conjurator of the number required, he should satisfy the accuser,\r\nthough he should not be rendered infamous for the future. This led to\r\nan increase of crime, and a hundred years later Casimir IV. proclaimed\r\na law by which compurgation was only allowed three times, after which\r\na persistent offender was abandoned to the full severity of the law,\r\nas being presumably guilty and not deserving of escape. At the same\r\ntime any one summoned to compurgation, and appearing before the judge\r\nwithout compurgators, was _ipso facto_ pronounced infamous. From a\r\ncase recorded it would appear that twelve conjurators were required\r\nto outweigh the single oath of the accuser.[236] Among the southern\r\nSlavs the custom was likewise preserved to a comparatively late date.\r\nAn edict of Hermann, Ban of Slavonia, in 1416, orders that any noble\r\naccused of neglect to enforce a decree of proscription against a\r\nmalefactor, should purge himself with five of his peers as conjurators,\r\nin default of which he was subject to a fine of twenty marcs.[237]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional reverence of the Englishman for established forms\r\nand customs, however, nominally preserved this relic of barbarism\r\nin the common law to a period later by far than its disappearance\r\nfrom the codes of other nations. The system of inquests and ordeals\r\nestablished by the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 and the rise of the\r\njury system led to its being superseded in criminal matters, but in\r\ncivil suits it held its own. According to Bracton, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, in all actions arising from contracts, sales, donations, etc.,\r\nwhen there was no absolute proof, the plaintiff came into court with\r\nhis _secta_, and the defendant was bound to produce two conjurators\r\nfor each one advanced by the plaintiff, the evidence apparently\r\npreponderating according to quantity rather than quality.[238] From the\r\ncontext, it would appear that the _secta_ of the plaintiff consisted\r\nof his friends and followers willing to take the oath with him, but\r\nnot absolutely witnesses. The Fleta, however, some twenty-five years\r\nlater, uses the term in the sense of witnesses, and in actions of\r\ndebt directs the defence to be made with conjurators double in number\r\nthe plaintiff’s witnesses,[239] thus offering an immense premium on\r\ndishonesty and perjury. Notwithstanding this, the nobles and gentry\r\nwho came to London to attend the court and Parliament apparently were\r\nsubjected to many annoyances by the citizens who strove to collect\r\ntheir debts, and in 1363 Edward III. relieved them by abrogating\r\nthe wholesome rule laid down by Bracton, and enacting that a debtor\r\ncould wage his law with a sufficient number of conjurators in spite\r\nof any papers put forward in evidence by the creditor, who is curtly\r\ntold to find his remedy in some other way.[240] The unquestionable\r\nadvantages which this offered to not the least influential part of a\r\nfeudal community probably had something to do with its preservation.\r\nThe “Termes de la Ley,” compiled in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, states as the existing practice that “when one shall wage his\r\nlaw, he shall bring with him 6, 8, or 12 of his neighbors, as the court\r\nshall assign him, to swear with him;” and when in a statute of 1585\r\nimposing severe fines for using wood or charcoal in iron manufacture\r\nit is provided that offenders shall not be entitled to defence by\r\nthe wager of law, it shows that proceeding to be still in common use,\r\nthough it was recognized as a means of eluding justice.[241] Style’s\r\n“Practical Register,” published in 1657, also describes the process,\r\nbut an absurd mistake as to the meaning of the traditional expression\r\n“jurare manu” shows that the matter was rather a legal curiosity\r\nthan a procedure in ordinary use; and, indeed, the author expressly\r\nstates that the practice having been “abused by the iniquity of the\r\npeople, the law was forced to find out another way to do justice to\r\nthe nation.” Still the law remained unaltered, and a case is recorded\r\noccurring in 1708, known as Gunner’s case, where “the plaintiff became\r\nnonsuit, when the defendant was ready to perfect his law,”[242] and\r\nJacob, in his “Review of the Statutes,” published not long after,\r\ntreats of it as still part of the existing judicial processes. As the\r\nwager of law came to be limited to simple actions of debt, shrewd\r\nlawyers found means of avoiding it by actions of “trespass upon the\r\ncase,” and other indirect forms which required the intervention of\r\na jury, but Burn in his Law Dictionary (Dublin, 1792) describes the\r\nwhole process with all its forms as still existing, and in 1799 a case\r\noccurred in which a defendant successfully eluded the payment of a\r\nclaim by producing compurgators who “each held up his right hand, and\r\nthen laid their hands upon the book and swore that they believed what\r\nthe defendant swore was true.” The court endeavored to prevent this\r\ninjustice, but was forced to accept the law of the land. Even this\r\ndid not provoke a change. In 1824, in the case of King _v._ Williams\r\n(2 Barnewell & Cresswell, 528), some black-letter lawyer revived the\r\nforgotten iniquity for the benefit of a client in want of testimony,\r\nand demanded that the court should prescribe the number of conjurators\r\nnecessary for the defence, but the court refused assistance, desiring\r\nto give the plaintiff the benefit of any mistake that might be made.\r\nWilliams then got together eleven conjurators, and appeared in court\r\nwith them at his back, when the plaintiff, recognizing the futility of\r\nany further proceedings, abandoned his case in disgust.[243] Still, the\r\nfine reverential spirit postponed the inevitable innovation, and it was\r\nnot until 1833 that the wager of law was formally abrogated by 3 and 4\r\nWilliam IV., c. 42, s. 13.[244]\r\n\r\nEnglish colonists carried the ancestral custom across the sea and seem\r\nto have resorted to it as an infallible mode of settling certain cases\r\nfor which no positive evidence could be had. Small as was the infant\r\ncolony of Bermuda, its court records for a little more than six months\r\nshow four instances of its use, all of which occur in deciding cases of\r\n“suspition of incontinency” regularly presented by the grand jury or\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities.[245]\r\n\r\nDoubtless if the early records of Virginia and Massachusetts could be\r\nsearched similar evidence of its use would be found in them. Indeed\r\nit is quite possible that, strictly speaking, the wager of law may\r\nstill preserve a legal existence in this country. In 1712 an act of\r\nthe Colony of South Carolina, enumerating the English laws to be held\r\nas in force there, specifically includes those relating to this mode\r\nof defence, and I am not aware that they have ever been formally\r\nabrogated.[246] In 1811 Chancellor Kilty, of Maryland, speaks of the\r\nwager of law as being totally disused in consequence of the avoidance\r\nof the forms of suit which might admit of its employment, but he\r\nevidently regards it as not then specifically abolished.[247]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the common sense of mankind was gradually eliminating the\r\npractice from among the recognized procedures of secular tribunals,\r\nthe immutable nature of ecclesiastical observances prolonged its\r\nvitality in the bosom of the church. We have seen above that Innocent\r\nIII., about the commencement of the thirteenth century, altered the\r\nform of oath from an unqualified confirmation to a mere assertion of\r\nbelief in the innocence of the accused. That this at once became the\r\nstandard formula in ecclesiastical cases is probable when we find it\r\nadopted for the oaths of the compurgators who, during the Albigensian\r\npersecution, were required by the nascent Inquisition in all cases to\r\nassist in the purgation of such suspected heretics as were allowed to\r\nescape so easily.[248] And this is no doubt the “congruous purgation”\r\nto which Innocent III. and Gregory IX. alluded as that by which\r\nsuspected heretics should clear themselves.[249] Zealous inquisitors,\r\nhowever, paid little attention to such forms which allowed their\r\nvictims a chance of escape, for it is related of Conrad of Marburg,\r\nwho for a short time spread terror and desolation throughout Germany,\r\nthat when the accused confessed he subjected them to torture and the\r\nfrightful penance provided by the church, but that when they denied\r\ntheir guilt he sent them at once to the stake. The compurgatorial\r\nprocess, however, vindicated itself in a notable manner when Conrad’s\r\ncruelties at length aroused effective opposition. Count Sayn, whom he\r\nhad accused, was virtually acquitted at the Council of Mainz, July,\r\n1233, soon after which Conrad was assassinated: the count, however,\r\nrequired formal vindication, and at the Diet of Frankfort, in February,\r\n1234, he cleared himself of the charge of heresy in the most imposing\r\nmanner with a train of compurgators comprising eight bishops, twelve\r\nCistercian abbots, twelve Franciscan and three Dominican monks, and a\r\nnumber of Benedictine abbots, clergy, and noble laymen. After this,\r\nin April, the Council of Mainz declared him and others of Conrad’s\r\nvictims to be innocent and to be restored to reputation and to their\r\npossessions.[250]\r\n\r\nThe practice of compurgation thus introduced at the foundation of the\r\nInquisition was maintained to the last by that terrible tribunal. “Our\r\nholy mother church,” says Simancas, Bishop of Badajos, a writer of the\r\nsixteenth century, “can in no way endure the suspicion of heresy, but\r\nseeks by various remedies to cure the suspect. Sometimes she forces\r\nthem to abjure or to purge themselves; sometimes she elicits the\r\ntruth by torture, and very often she coerces them with extraordinary\r\npunishments.” Therefore, any one whose orthodoxy was doubtful, if he\r\nwas unwilling to clear himself, at the command of the judge, was held\r\nto be convicted of heresy. By the secular law he had a year’s grace\r\nbefore condemnation, but under the ecclesiastical law he was instantly\r\npunishable.[251]\r\n\r\nCanonical purgation, according to the rules of the Inquisition, was\r\nindicated when public report rendered a man suspected and there was\r\nno tangible evidence against him. The number of compurgators was left\r\nto the discretion of the judge, who at the same time decided whether\r\nthe deficiency of one, two, or more would amount to a condemnation.\r\nThey were to be peers of the accused; and though he was allowed to\r\nselect them, yet the qualification that they were to be good men and\r\northodox practically left their nomination to the officials—even as the\r\ncustomary accusation by the promotor-fiscal was held to be in itself\r\nthe requisite amount of suspicion required as a condition precedent\r\nfor the trial. The greater the suspicion, however, the larger was the\r\nnumber of compurgators to be adduced.\r\n\r\nWhen the accused had chosen his men, and they were accepted by the\r\njudge, they were summoned, and each one examined separately by the\r\nInquisitors as to his acquaintance with the defendant—a process by\r\nwhich, it may readily be conceived, the terrors of the Holy Office\r\nmight easily be so used as to render them extremely unwilling to\r\nbecome his sponsors. They were then assembled together; the accused\r\nwas brought in, the charge against him was read, and he took an oath\r\ndenying it. Each conjurator was then taken separately and sworn as\r\nto his belief in the truth or falsity of the oath of denegation, and\r\naccording as they expressed their conviction of the veracity of the\r\naccused the sentence was usually rendered, absolving or condemning him.\r\n\r\nNo process of administering compurgation can well be conceived more\r\nshrewdly adapted to reduce to a minimum the chances of acquittal,\r\nor to leave the result subject to the wishes of the officials. The\r\ntestimony of the doctors of law, both civil and canon, accordingly was\r\nthat it was blind, deceitful, and perilous.[252] In fact, it is easy\r\nto conceive of the difficulty of finding five, or nine, or eleven men\r\nwilling to risk their lives and families by standing up in support of\r\nany one who had fallen into the grasp of the Holy Office. The terrible\r\napprehension which the Inquisition spread abroad among all classes,\r\nand the dread which every man felt of being suspected and seized as an\r\naccomplice of heresy, are unconsciously intimated by Simancas when,\r\narguing against this mode of trial, he observes that “the morals of\r\nmankind are so corrupt at the present day, and Christian charity has\r\ngrown so cold, that it is almost impossible to find any one willing to\r\njoin in clearing his neighbor, or who does not easily believe the worst\r\nof him and construe all doubtful things against him. When it is enough\r\nfor the condemnation of the accused that the compurgators shall declare\r\nthat they are ignorant or doubtful as to his innocence, who is there\r\nthat will not express doubt when they know that he would not have been\r\ncondemned to purge himself if he had not been violently suspected?”\r\nFor these reasons he says that those of Moorish or Jewish stock should\r\nnever be subjected to it, for it is almost impossible not to think ill\r\nof them, and, therefore, to send them to purgation is simply to send\r\nthem to the stake.[253]\r\n\r\nFor all this, there was a lively discussion in the time of Simancas,\r\nwhether if the accused succeeded in thus clearing himself, it was\r\nsufficient for acquittal. Many Inquisitors, indeed, held to the\r\nolder practice that the accused should first be tortured, when if no\r\nconfession could be forced from him he was put on his purgation; if\r\nhe passed safely through this, he was then made to abjure the errors\r\nof which he had not been convicted, and after all this he was punished\r\nat the discretion of the judge.[254] Such an accumulation of injustice\r\nseems incredible, and yet Simancas feels himself obliged to enter into\r\nan elaborate discussion to prove its impropriety.\r\n\r\nIn countries where the Inquisition had not infected society and\r\ndestroyed all feeling of sympathy between man and man this process of\r\npurgation was not impossible. Thus, in 1527, during one of the early\r\npersecutions of the reformers under Henry VIII., while numbers were\r\nconvicted, two women, Margaret Cowbridge and Margery Bowgas, were\r\nallowed to clear themselves by compurgators, though there were several\r\npositive witnesses against them. It is also noteworthy that in these\r\ncases a portion of the compurgators were women.[255]\r\n\r\nIn the regular ecclesiastical courts the practice was maintained.\r\nWhen the Council of Constance, in its futile efforts at reformation,\r\nprepared an elaborate code of discipline, it proposed strenuous\r\nregulations to correct the all-pervading vice of simony. To prevent\r\nthe sale of benefices this project of law decreed deprivation of all\r\npreferment as the punishment for such offences, and as transactions\r\nof the kind were commonly accomplished in secret, it ordained that\r\ncommon report should be sufficient for conviction; yet it nullified\r\nthe regulation by permitting the accused to clear himself by canonical\r\npurgation.[256] Towards the close of the fifteenth century, Angelo da\r\nChiavasco describes it as customary where there is no formal accuser\r\nand yet public rumor requires action, although the judge can also order\r\nit in cases of accusation: if the defendant fails of his purgation\r\nin the latter case he is to be punished as provided for his crime;\r\nif there is only rumor, then the penalty is discretional.[257] The\r\njudge determined the number of conjurators, who were all to be of good\r\nreputation and familiar with the life of the accused; if he were a\r\nmonk, they ought if possible to be of the same order; they simply swore\r\nto their belief in his oath of denial.[258] A century later Lancelotti\r\nspeaks of compurgation as the only mode of defence then in use in\r\ndoubtful cases, where the evidence was insufficient.[259] This applied\r\nnot only to cases between churchmen, but also to secular matters\r\nsubject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Grillandus, writing about 1530,\r\nspeaks of six conjurators of the kindred as the customary formula\r\nin proceedings for nullity of marriage, and mentions an instance\r\npersonally known to him, wherein this procedure was successfully\r\nadopted by a wife desirous of a divorce from her husband who for three\r\nyears had been rendered impotent by witchcraft, in accordance with the\r\nrules laid down in the canon law for such cases.[260] And among certain\r\norders of monks within the last century, questions arising between\r\nthemselves were settled by this mode of trial.[261]\r\n\r\nIn England, after the Anglican Church had received its final shape\r\nunder Cranmer, during the reign of Edward VI., the custom appears in\r\na carefully compiled body of ecclesiastical law, of which the formal\r\nadoption was only prevented accidentally by the untimely death of the\r\nyoung king. By this, a man accused of a charge resting on presumptions\r\nand incompletely proved, was required to clear himself with four\r\ncompurgators of his own rank, who swore, as provided in the decretals\r\nof Innocent III., to their belief in his innocence.[262]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nACCUSATORIAL CONJURATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not strictly a portion of our subject, the question is not\r\nwithout interest as to the power or obligation of the plaintiff or\r\naccuser to fortify his case with conjurators. There is little evidence\r\nof such a custom in primitive times, but one or two allusions to it\r\nin the _Leges Barbarorum_ show that it was occasionally practised.\r\nSome of the earlier texts of the Salic law contain a section providing\r\nthat in certain cases the complainant shall sustain his action with\r\na number of conjurators varying with the amount at stake; a larger\r\nnumber is required of the defendant in reply; and it is presumable that\r\nthe judges weighed the probabilities on either side and rendered a\r\ndecision accordingly.[263] As this is omitted in the later revisions of\r\nthe law, it probably was not widely practised, or regarded as of much\r\nimportance. Among the Baioarians, a claimant of an estate produced six\r\nconjurators who took the oath with him, and whose united efforts could\r\nbe rebutted by the defendant with a single competent witness.[264]\r\nThese directions are so precise that there can be no doubt that the\r\ncustom prevailed to a limited extent among certain tribes, and a clause\r\nin the Decree of Childebert in 597, providing that the oaths of five\r\nor seven impartial men of good character shall convict a thief or\r\nmalefactor, would seem evidently to refer to conjurators and not to\r\nwitnesses.[265] In the treaty between Childebert and Clotair in 593,\r\nan accuser in case of theft is obliged to give twelve conjurators,\r\nhalf of them selected by himself, to swear that a theft has really\r\ntaken place.[266] That it was, indeed, more generally employed than\r\nthe scanty references to it in the codes would indicate, may be\r\ninferred from one of the ecclesiastical forgeries which Charlemagne\r\nwas induced to adopt and promulgate. According to this, no accusation\r\nagainst a bishop could be successful unless supported by seventy-two\r\nwitnesses, all of whom were to be men of good repute; forty-four were\r\nrequired to substantiate a charge against a priest, thirty-seven\r\nin the case of a deacon, and seven when a member of the inferior\r\ngrades was implicated.[267] Though styled witnesses in the text,\r\nthe number required is so large that they evidently could have been\r\nonly conjurators, with whom the complainant supported his oath of\r\naccusation, and the fabrication of such a law would seem to show that\r\nthe practice of employing such means of substantiating a charge was\r\nfamiliar to the minds of men.\r\n\r\nAmong the heathen Northmen, as we have seen, every pleader, whether\r\nplaintiff or defendant, was obliged to take a preliminary oath on the\r\nsacred _stalla hringr_, or altar ring, duly bathed in the blood of an\r\nox sacrificed for the purpose. This custom was preserved in England,\r\nwhere the Anglo-Saxon laws required, except in trivial cases, a\r\n“fore-oath” from the accuser (_forath, antejuramentum, præjuramentum_),\r\nand William the Conqueror, in his compilation of the laws of Edward the\r\nConfessor, shows that this was sometimes strengthened by requiring the\r\naddition of conjurators, who were in no sense witnesses, since their\r\noath had reference, not to the facts of the case, but solely to the\r\npurity of intention on the part of the accuser.[268] Indications of the\r\nsame procedure are to be found in the collection known as the laws of\r\nHenry I.[269] Probably to the development of this may be attributed the\r\npeculiar device of the _secta_ already referred to (p. 84), consisting\r\nof those who supported the plaintiff by their oaths while in no sense\r\nabsolute witnesses. They were not even examined unless the defendant\r\ndemanded it. The bringing of the _secta_ or suit remained a matter\r\nof form long after the actual production of the witnesses had become\r\nobsolete in the fourteenth century, and it was not finally abolished\r\nuntil 1852.[270]\r\n\r\nIn an age of comparative simplicity, it is natural that men should turn\r\nrather to the guarantees of individual character, or to the forms of\r\nvenerable superstition, than to the subtleties of legal procedure. Even\r\nas the defendant was expected to produce vouchers of his truthfulness,\r\nso might the plaintiff be equally required to give evidence that his\r\nrepute among his neighbors was such as to justify the belief that he\r\nwould not bring a false charge or advance an unfounded claim. The two\r\ncustoms appear to arise from the same process of reasoning and to be\r\nidentical in spirit, leading to a contest between the two parties as\r\nto which could bring forward the largest and most credible number of\r\nconjurators, and the position of the accused being outsworn was a\r\nrecognized circumstance in jurisprudence. Thus, the Council of Tribur\r\nin 895 provides that in such case he must either confess or undergo\r\nthe ordeal.[271] In process of time accusatorial conjurators became\r\ncommonly used in many places. In Béarn the laws of the thirteenth\r\ncentury provide that in cases of debt under forty sous, where there was\r\nno testimony on either side, the claimant could substantiate his case\r\nby bringing forward one conjurator, while the defendant could rebut\r\nit with two.[272] A similar rule obtained in England in all actions\r\narising from contracts and sales;[273] and in the laws of Soest in\r\nWestphalia, compiled at the end of the eleventh or the commencement\r\nof the twelfth century, an accusation of homicide could be proved by\r\nsix conjurators swearing with the prosecutor, while if this failed\r\nthe accused could then clear himself with eleven compurgators.[274]\r\nThroughout Germany, in the thirteenth century, we find the principle\r\nof accusing conjurators generally received, as is evident from the\r\n_juramentum supermortuum_ already referred to, and other provisions of\r\nthe municipal law.[275] So thoroughly, indeed, was this established\r\nthat, in some places, in prosecutions for highway robbery, arson, and\r\nother crimes, the accuser had a right to require every individual in\r\ncourt, from the judge to the spectator, to help him with an oath or\r\nto swear that he knew nothing of the matter, and even the attorney\r\nfor the defendant was obliged to undergo the ceremony.[276] In Sweden\r\nit was likewise in use under the name of _jeff niteed_;[277] and in\r\nthe compilation of the laws by Andreas, Archbishop of Lunden, in the\r\nthirteenth century, there is a curious provision for cases of secret\r\nmurder by which the accuser could force nine men successively to\r\nundergo the hot-iron ordeal, after which, if thus far unsuccessful, he\r\ncould still force a tenth man to trial on producing twelve conjurators\r\nto swear to the guilt of the accused—these conjurators, in case of\r\nacquittal, being each liable to a fine of three marks to the accused\r\nand as much to the church.[278] In Norway and Iceland, in certain cases\r\nof imputed crime, the accuser was bound to produce ten companions, of\r\nwhom eight appeared simply as supporters, while two swore that they\r\nhad heard the offence spoken of, but that they knew nothing about it of\r\ntheir own knowledge—the amount of weight attached to which asseveration\r\nis shown by the fact that the accused required only two conjurators to\r\nclear himself.[279]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most careful valuation of the oath of a plaintiff is to be\r\nfound in the Coutumier of Bordeaux, which provides that, in civil cases\r\nnot exceeding four sols in amount, the claimant should substantiate\r\nhis case by an oath on the Gospels in the Mayor’s Court; when from\r\nfour to twenty sols were at stake, he was sworn on the altar of St.\r\nProjet or St. Antoine; from twenty sols to fifteen livres, the oath\r\nwas taken in the cemetery of St. Seurin, while for amounts above that\r\nsum it was administered on the “Fort” or altar of St. Seurin himself.\r\nPersons whose want of veracity was notorious were obliged in all cases,\r\nhowever unimportant, to swear on the Fort, and had moreover to provide\r\na conjurator who with an oath of equal solemnity asserted his belief in\r\nthe truth of his companion.[280]\r\n\r\nThe custom of supporting an accusatorial oath by conjurators was\r\nmaintained in some portions of Europe to a comparatively recent\r\nperiod. Wachter[281] prints a curious account of a trial, occurring\r\nin a Suabian court in 1505, which illustrates this, as well as the\r\nweight which was still attached to the oath of a defendant. A woman\r\naccused three men on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of\r\nher husband. They denied the charge, but when the oath of negation\r\nwas tendered to them, with the assurance that, if they were Suabians,\r\nit would acquit them, they demanded time for consideration. Then the\r\nadvocate of the widow stepped forward to offer the oath of accusation,\r\nand two conjurators being found willing to support him the accused\r\nwere condemned without further examination on either side. A similar\r\nprocess was observed in the Vehmgericht, or Court of the Free Judges\r\nof Westphalia, whose jurisdiction in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies became extended over the whole of Germany. Accusations were\r\nsupported by conjurators, and when the defendant was a Frei-graff, or\r\npresiding officer of a tribunal, the complainant was obliged to procure\r\nseven Frei-schöppen, or free judges, to take the accusatorial oath with\r\nhim.[282]\r\n\r\nThe latest indication that I have met with of established legal\r\nprovisions of this nature occurs in the custom of Britanny, as revised\r\nin 1539. By this, a man claiming compensation for property taken away\r\nis to be believed on oath as to his statement of its value, provided he\r\ncan procure companions worthy of credence to depose “qu’ils croyent que\r\nle jureur ait fait bon et loyal serment.”[283] Even this last vestige\r\ndisappears in the revision of the Coutumier made by order of Henry III.\r\nin 1580.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                         THE WAGER OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen man is emerging from barbarism, the struggle between the rising\r\npower of reason and the waning supremacy of brute force is full of\r\ninstruction. Wise in our generation, we laugh at the inconsistencies\r\nof our forefathers, which, rightly considered as portions of the great\r\ncycle of human progress, are rather to be respected as trophies of\r\nthe silent victory, won by almost imperceptible gradations. When,\r\ntherefore, in the dark ages, we find the administration of justice so\r\nstrangely interrupted by appeals to the sword or to chance, dignified\r\nunder the forms of Christianized superstition, we should remember that\r\neven this is an improvement on the all-pervading first law of violence.\r\nWe should not wonder that barbarous tribes require to be enticed to\r\nthe acknowledgment of abstract right through pathways which, though\r\ndevious, may reach the goal at last. When the strong man is brought,\r\nby whatever means, to yield to the weak, a great conquest is gained\r\nover human nature; and if the aid of superstition is invoked to decide\r\nthe struggle, it is idle for us, while enjoying the result, to contemn\r\nthe means which the weakness of human nature has rendered necessary to\r\nthe end. With uneducated nations, as with uneducated men, sentiment is\r\nstronger than reason, and sacrifices will be made for the one which\r\nare refused to the other. If, therefore, the fierce warrior, resolute\r\nto maintain an injustice or a usurpation, can be brought to submit\r\nhis claim to the chances of an equal combat or of an ordeal, he has\r\nalready taken a vast step towards acknowledging the supremacy of right\r\nand abandoning the personal independence which is incompatible with\r\nthe relations of human society. It is by such indirect means that\r\nindividuals, each relying on his own right hand, have been gradually\r\nled to endure regular forms of government, and to cherish the abstract\r\nidea of justice as indispensable between man and man. Viewed in this\r\nlight, the ancient forms of procedure lose their ludicrous aspect, and\r\nwe contemplate their whimsical admixture of force, faith, and reason,\r\nas we might the first rude engine of Watt, or the “Clermont,” which\r\npainfully labored in the waters of the Hudson—clumsy and rough it is\r\ntrue, yet venerable as the origin and prognostic of future triumphs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a natural tendency in the human mind to cast the burden of its\r\ndoubts upon a higher power, and to relieve itself from the effort of\r\ndecision by seeking in the unknown the solution of its difficulties.\r\nBetween the fetish worshippers of Congo and the polished sceptics\r\nwho frequented the _salon_ of Mlle. le Normant, the distance, though\r\ngreat, is bridged over by this common weakness; and whether the\r\ninformation sought be of the past or of the future, the impulse is\r\nthe same. When, therefore, in the primitive _mallum_, the wisdom of\r\nthe _rachinborgs_ was at fault, and the absence or equal balance of\r\ntestimony rendered a verdict difficult, what was more natural than to\r\nappeal for a decision to the powers above, and to leave the matter\r\nto the judgment of God?[284] Nor, with the warlike instincts of the\r\nrace, is it surprising that this appeal should be made to the God of\r\nbattles, to whom, whether they addressed him as Odin or Sabaoth, they\r\nlooked in every case for a special interposition in favor of innocence.\r\nThe curious mingling of procedure, in these untutored seekings after\r\njustice, is well illustrated in a form of process prescribed by the\r\nprimitive Bavarian law. A man comes into court with six conjurators to\r\nclaim an estate; the possessor defends his right with a single witness,\r\nwho must be a landholder of the vicinage. The claimant then attacks\r\nthe veracity of the witness—“Thou hast lied against me. Grant me the\r\nsingle combat, and let God make manifest whether thou hast sworn truth\r\nor falsehood;”[285] and, according to the event of the duel is the\r\ndecision as to the truthfulness of the witness and the ownership of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn discussing the judicial combat, it is important to keep in view the\r\nwide distinction between the wager of battle as a judicial institution,\r\nand the custom of duelling which has obtained with more or less\r\nregularity among all races and at all ages. When the Horatii met the\r\nCuriatii, or when Antony challenged Octavius to decide the empire of\r\nthe world with their two swords, or when Edward III. in 1340 proposed\r\nto Philippe de Valois to settle their rival claims to the heritage of\r\nFrance army to army, a hundred to a hundred, or body to body,[286] or\r\nwhen the ancient Hindus were in the habit of averting the carnage of\r\nbattles in the same manner[287]—these were simply expedients to save\r\nthe unnecessary effusion of blood, or to gratify individual hate. When\r\nthe _raffiné_ of the times of Henri Quatre, or the modern fire-eater,\r\nhas wiped out some imaginary stain in the blood of his antagonist,\r\nthe duel thus fought, though bearing a somewhat closer analogy to the\r\njudicial combat, is not derived from it, but from the right of private\r\nvengeance which was common to all the barbarian tribes, and from the\r\ncognate right of private warfare which was the exclusive privilege of\r\nthe gentry during the feudal period.[288] The established euphuistic\r\nformula of demanding “the satisfaction of a gentleman,” thus designates\r\nboth the object of the custom and its origin. The abolition of private\r\nwars gave a stimulus to the duel at nearly the period when the judicial\r\ncombat fell gradually into desuetude. The one thus succeeded to the\r\nother, and, being kindred in form, it is not surprising that for a\r\ntime there was some confusion in the minds of men respecting their\r\ndistinctive characteristics. Yet it is not difficult to draw the line\r\nbetween them. The object of the one was vengeance and reparation;\r\nthe theory of the other was the discovery of truth and the impartial\r\nministration of justice.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to multiply examples illustrating this. John van Arckel, a\r\nknight of Holland, followed Godfrey of Bouillon to the first crusade.\r\nWhen some German forces joined the army, a Tyrolese noble, seeing\r\nvan Arckel’s arms displayed before his tent, and recognizing them\r\nas identical with his own, ordered them torn down. The insult was\r\nflagrant, but the injured knight sought no immediate satisfaction\r\nfor his honor. He laid the case before the chiefs of the crusade as\r\na judicial matter; an examination was made, and both parties proved\r\ntheir ancestral right to the same bearings. To decide the conflicting\r\nand incompatible pretensions, the judges ordered the judicial combat,\r\nin which van Arckel deprived his antagonist of life and quarterings\r\ntogether, and vindicated his claim to the argent 2 bars gules, which\r\nin gratitude to Heaven he bore for eight long years in Palestine. This\r\nwas not a quarrel on a punctilio, nor a mode of obtaining redress for\r\nan insult, but an examination into a legal question which admitted of\r\nno other solution according to the manners of the age.[289] When, after\r\nthe Sicilian Vespers, the wily Charles of Anjou was sorely pressed by\r\nhis victorious rival Pedro III. of Aragon, and desired to gain time\r\nin order to repress a threatened insurrection among his peninsular\r\nsubjects, he sent a herald to Don Pedro to accuse him of bad faith in\r\nhaving commenced the war without defiance. The fiery Catalan fell into\r\nthe snare, and in order to clear himself of the charge, which was not\r\nill-founded, he offered to meet his accuser in combat and determine\r\ntheir rights to the Sicilian throne. The terms were laboriously settled\r\nby six representatives of each king and were signed by the principals\r\nDecember 26, 1282; they were to meet, with a hundred knights on each\r\nside, June 1, 1283, in the neutral territory of Bordeaux and fight it\r\nout in the presence of Edward I. of England or of his deputy, and each\r\nswore that if he failed to be present he would forever hold himself as\r\nfalse and perjured and deprived of the royal station and dignity. When\r\nCharles applied to his cousin Edward to grant the _champ-clos_ the\r\nlatter emphatically replied that for the crowns of the Two Sicilies\r\nhe would not be judge in such a combat; Martin II. chimed in with a\r\nbull forbidding him to serve, and the combat never took place, Charles\r\nof Anjou having obtained his purpose in the intervening suspension of\r\narms.[290] Nothing more picturesquely romantic is to be found in the\r\nannals of chivalry than Muntaner’s relation of Don Pedro’s secret ride\r\nto Bordeaux and his appearance on the day appointed in the lists where\r\nEdward’s seneschal was unable to guarantee him a fair field.[291] So\r\nthe challenge which Richard II., in 1383, sent to Charles VI. wore\r\nthe aspect of the judicial duel to decide their claims to the realms\r\nof France under the judgment of God.[292] Though practically these\r\nchallenges may differ little from that of Antony, still their form and\r\npurport were those of the judicial duel in civil or criminal cases.\r\nSo, when Charles V. offered to maintain in single combat the charge\r\nthat Francis I. had villainously forfeited his faith in disregarding\r\nthe treaty of Madrid, and Francis hotly replied with a demand for\r\na secure field in which to defend his honor, the challenge and its\r\nacceptance wore the form of the judicial duel to decide the question\r\nof guilt; although Charles in appointing the Bidasoa as the place of\r\nmeeting gave as his reasons the avoidance of bloodshed and the ending\r\nof the war as well as the maintenance of his just cause.[293] The\r\ncelebrated duel, fought in 1547, between Jarnac and La Chastaigneraye,\r\nso piteously deplored by honest old Brantôme, shows the distinction\r\nmaintained to the last. It was conducted with all judicial ceremonies,\r\nin presence of Henry II., not to settle a point of honor, but to\r\njustify Jarnac from a disgusting accusation brought by his adversary.\r\nResulting most unexpectedly in the death of La Chastaigneraye, who was\r\na favorite of the king, the monarch was induced to put an end to all\r\nlegalized combats, though the illegal practice of the private duel\r\nnot only continued to flourish, but increased beyond all precedent\r\nduring the succeeding half century—Henry IV. having granted in\r\ntwenty-two years no less than seven thousand letters of pardon for\r\nduels fought in contravention of the royal edicts. Such a mode of\r\nobtaining “satisfaction” is so repugnant to the spirit of our age that\r\nit is perhaps not to be wondered at if its advocates should endeavor\r\nto affiliate it upon the ancient wager of battle. Both relics of\r\nbarbarism, it is true, are developments from the same primitive habits\r\nand customs, yet they are essentially distinct and have coexisted as\r\nseparate institutions; and, however much occasionally intermingled by\r\nthe passions of periods of violence, they were practised for different\r\nends, and were conducted with different forms of procedure. We have\r\nonly to deal with the combat as a strictly judicial process, and\r\nshall, therefore, leave untouched the vast harvest of curious anecdote\r\nafforded by the monomachial propensities of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE JUDICIAL DUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mediæval panegyrists of the wager of battle sought to strengthen\r\nits title to respect by affirming that it was as old as the human race,\r\nand that Cain and Abel, unable to settle their conflicting claims in\r\nany other mode, agreed to leave the decision to the chances of the\r\nduel; while the combat between David and Goliath was considered by\r\nthe early schoolmen as an unanswerable proof of the favor with which\r\nGod regarded such encounters. Leaving such speculations aside, it is\r\nenough for us to know that all the tribes which settled in Europe\r\npractised the combat with so general a unanimity that its origin must\r\nbe sought at a period anterior to their separation from the common\r\nstock, although it has left no definite traces in the written records\r\nwhich have reached us of the Asiatic Aryans.[294]\r\n\r\nThat some vague notions of Divine justice making itself manifest\r\nthrough the sword must have existed in prehistoric Hellenic times\r\nis apparent from Homer’s elaborate description of the duel between\r\nMenelaus and Paris. This has all the characteristics of a judicial\r\ncombat to decide the guilt or innocence of the claimants for the\r\npossession of the fair Helen. A preliminary sacrifice is offered to\r\nZeus; Hector and Ulysses measure out the ground; lots are cast to\r\ndecide which of the antagonists shall have the first throw of the\r\nspear; and the assembled armies put up a prayer to Zeus, entreating him\r\nto send to Hades the guilty one of the two combatants.[295] This is not\r\nmerely a device to put an end to the slaughter of brave warriors—it is\r\nan appeal to Heaven to elicit justice by means of arms.\r\n\r\nThe Italiote branch of the Aryans affords us a more definite\r\nillustration of the same belief in the custom of the Umbrians, who\r\nsettled quarrels by single combat, and deemed that he who slew his\r\nadversary thus proved that his cause was just.[296]\r\n\r\nAlthough Cæsar makes no mention of such a custom in Gaul, it evidently\r\nprevailed among the Celtic tribes. Livy describes how some Spaniards\r\nseized the opportunity of a show of gladiators, given by Scipio, to\r\nsettle various civil suits by combat, and he proceeds to particularize\r\na case in which two rival cousins decided in this manner a disputed\r\nquestion in the law of descent, despite the earnest remonstrances of\r\nthe Roman commander.[297] Among the Irish Celts, at their appearance\r\nin history, we find the judicial duel established with fixed\r\nregulations. In the Senchus Mor, a code claiming to be compiled under\r\nthe supervision of St. Patrick, the delay of five days in a distress\r\nis explained by the history of a combat between two long previous in\r\nMagh-inis. “When they had all things ready for plying their arms,\r\nexcept a witness alone, they met a woman at the place of combat, and\r\nshe requested of them a delay, saying, ‘If it were my husband that\r\nwere there I would compel you to delay.’ ‘I would delay,’ said one\r\nof them, ‘but it would be prejudicial to the man who sues me; it is\r\nhis cause that would be delayed.’ ‘I will delay,’ said the other. The\r\ncombat was then put off, but they did not know till when it was put\r\noff, until Conchubhur and Sencha passed judgment respecting it; and\r\nSencha asked, ‘What is the name of this woman?’ ‘Cuicthi,’ (five) said\r\nshe, ‘is my name.’ ‘Let the combat be delayed,’ said Sencha, ‘in the\r\nname of this woman for five days.’”[298] The combative ardor of the\r\nFeini, indeed, was so strong, and the appeal to the wager of battle\r\nso general, that on their conversion to Christianity they found it\r\ndifficult to understand that the holy ministers of Christ should be\r\nrestricted from vindicating their rights by arms, and St. Patrick, in\r\na synod held in 456, was obliged to threaten his clergy with expulsion\r\nfrom the church if they endeavored to escape by appeal to the sword\r\nfrom settling obligations which they had incurred by giving security\r\nfor heathens.[299]\r\n\r\nThis prevalence of the wager of battle among the Irish Celts renders\r\nprobable its existence likewise among the early inhabitants of Britain.\r\nIf so, the long domination of the Romans was doubtless sufficient to\r\nextinguish all traces of it. The Welsh laws attributed to Hoel Dda in\r\nthe early part of the tenth century, which are exceedingly minute and\r\nprecise in their directions as to all forms of legal procedure, make no\r\nallusion to it whatever. It is true that an ancient collection of laws\r\nasserts that the code of Dyvnwal-moel-mud, a British king, prescribed\r\nthe ordeals of battle, of hot iron, and of boiling water, and that\r\nHoel in his legislation considered them unjust, abrogated them, and\r\nsubstituted the proof by men, or _raith_.[300] This legend, however,\r\nis very apocryphal. There is no allusion to such customs in the Welsh\r\ncodes up to the close of the twelfth century, and the few indications\r\nwhich occur in subsequent collections would seem to indicate that these\r\nwere rather innovations due to the influence of the English conquest\r\nthan revivals of ancient institutions.\r\n\r\nAmong the Slavs, as they emerge into history, the duel occupies a\r\ncontrolling position in the administration of justice. Ibn Dost, an\r\nArab traveller in Russia in the tenth century, relates that a pleader\r\ndissatisfied with the judgment of the king could always appeal to the\r\nsword, and this decision was regarded as so absolute that the defeated\r\nparty, his family and possessions were all at the disposition of the\r\nvictor. In Bohemia at a later period the successful combatant was\r\nrequired to decapitate his antagonist.[301] The earliest records of\r\nthe various other Slavic lands give evidence of the prevalence of the\r\njudicial combat, showing that it formed part of their ancestral customs\r\nprior to their occupation of their present territories.[302]\r\n\r\nAmong the Norræna branch of the Teutons the wager of battle can be\r\ntraced back to the realm of legend and tradition. Saxo Grammaticus\r\ninforms us that about the Christian era Frotho III., or the\r\nGreat, of Denmark, ordered the employment of the duel to settle\r\nall controversies, preferring that his warriors should accustom\r\nthemselves to rely, not on eloquence, but on courage and skill;[303]\r\nand however doubtful the chronology may be, the tradition shows that\r\nthe origin of the custom was lost in the depths of antiquity. Among\r\nthe heathen Norsemen, indeed, the _holm-gang_, or single combat, was\r\nso universal an arbiter that it was recognized as conferring a right\r\nwhere none pre-existed. Any athlete, who confided in his strength\r\nand dexterity with his weapons, could acquire property by simply\r\nchallenging its owner to surrender his land or fight for it. When\r\nIceland, for instance, was in process of settlement, Kraku Hreidar\r\nsailed thither, and on sighting land invoked Thor to assign to him\r\na tract of ground which he would forthwith acquire by duel. He was\r\nshipwrecked on reaching the shore, and was hospitably received by\r\na compatriot named Havard, with whom he passed the winter. In the\r\nspring he declared his purpose of challenging Sæmund Sudureyska for a\r\nsufficient holding, but Havard dissuaded him, arguing that this mode of\r\nacquiring property rarely prospered in the end, and Eirek of Goddolom\r\nsucceeded in quieting him by giving him land enough. Others of these\r\nhardy sea-rovers were not so amenable to reason as Kraku. When Hallkell\r\ncame to Iceland and passed the winter with his brother Ketelbiorn, the\r\nlatter offered him land on which to settle, but Hallkell disdained so\r\npeaceful a proposition, and preferred to summon a neighbor named Grim\r\nto surrender his property or meet him in the _holm-gang_. Grim accepted\r\nthe defiance, was slain, and Hallkell was duly installed as his heir.\r\nA variation of the custom is illustrated by the case of Hrolleif,\r\nwho after some years’ settlement grew dissatisfied with his holding,\r\nand challenged his neighbor Eyvind to an exchange of properties or a\r\ncombat, alternatives of which the peace-loving Eyvind accepted the\r\nformer.[304] The Saga of Egil Skallagrimsson speaks of a noted duellist\r\nknown as Ljot the Pale, who had come to the district a landless\r\nstranger, and had grown wealthy by thus challenging proprietors and\r\ntaking their lands, but who met his fate at the hands of Egil, who,\r\nwhile travelling, came to the place where Ljot was about to engage in a\r\nholm-gang with a weaker antagonist. Egil volunteered to take his place,\r\nand promptly slew Ljot. The holm-gang was so named because the battle\r\nwas usually fought on a small island or holm; and that it was regarded\r\nas an appeal to the gods is manifested by the custom of the victor\r\nsacrificing an ox as soon as he left the spot.[305]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Tacitus makes no allusion to such a custom among the\r\nGermans of his time, a passage which is frequently quoted to that\r\neffect being in reality only a description of a mode of divination\r\nin which, at the beginning of a war, one of the enemy was captured\r\nand made to fight with a chosen champion, the result of the combat\r\nbeing taken to foreshadow the event of the contest.[306] The object of\r\nTacitus, however, was not to excite the curiosity of his countrymen,\r\nbut rather to contrast their vices with the uncivilized virtues of\r\nthe Germans, and his silence on this point is not a negative evidence\r\nof weight in comparison with the positive proofs which exist with\r\nregard to kindred tribes. Be this as it may, as soon as we obtain an\r\ninsight into their customs from written laws, we find the wager of\r\nbattle everywhere recognized. The earliest of these is the code of the\r\nBurgundians, collected by King Gundobald towards the close of the fifth\r\ncentury, and in this the duel occupies a place so conspicuous that it\r\nobtained in time the name of Lex Gundebalda or Loy Gombette, giving\r\nrise to a belief that it was of Burgundian origin.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary texts of the Salic law no mention is made of it, but in\r\none manuscript it is alluded to as a regular form of procedure.[307]\r\nThis silence, however, does not justify the conclusion that the battle\r\nordeal was not practised among the Franks. Enough instances of it are\r\nto be found in their early history to show that it was by no means\r\nuncommon;[308] and, at a later period, the same absence of reference\r\nto it is observable in the Lex Emendata of Charlemagne, though the\r\ncapitularies of that monarch frequently allude to it as a legal process\r\nin general use. The off-shoots of the Salic law, the Ripuarian,\r\nAllemannic, and Bavarian codes—which were compiled by Thierry, the\r\nson of Clovis, revised successively by Childebert and Clotair II.,\r\nand put into final shape by Dagobert I. about the year 630—in their\r\nfrequent reference to the “campus,” show how thoroughly it pervaded\r\nthe entire system of Germanic jurisprudence. The Lombards were, if\r\npossible, even more addicted to its use. Their earliest laws, compiled\r\nby King Rotharis in 643, seventy-six years after their occupation of\r\nItaly, make constant allusion to it, and their readiness to refer to\r\nits decision the most conspicuous cases is shown in the story of Queen\r\nGundeberga, the wife of Ariovaldus, who was the immediate predecessor\r\nof Rotharis. Adalulf, a disappointed lover, brought against her a\r\ncharge of conspiracy which induced Ariovaldus to cast her in prison,\r\nwhere she lay for three years, until Clotair the Great, to whom she\r\nwas of kindred, sent an embassy to obtain her release. Diplomacy was\r\nof no avail, and all that the Frankish envoys could accomplish was to\r\nsecure for her a trial by single combat, in which a champion named\r\nPitto overcame Adalulf the accuser, and Gundeberga was restored to the\r\nthrone with her innocence recognized.[309] Indeed, the tenacious hold\r\nwhich it maintained on the veneration of the Lombards is seen in the\r\nfruitless efforts to restrict its employment and to abrogate it by\r\nRotharis and his successors under the civilizing influence of contact\r\nwith Roman institutions. Thus Rotharis forbids its use in some cases\r\nof importance, substituting conjurators, with a marked expression of\r\ndisbelief, which shows how little confidence was felt in its results by\r\nenlightened men.[310] The next lawgiver, King Grimoald, decreed that\r\nthirty years’ possession of either land or liberty relieved a defendant\r\nfrom maintaining his title by battle, the privilege of employing\r\nconjurators being then conceded to him.[311] In the succeeding\r\ncentury, King Liutprand sought to abolish it entirely, but finding\r\nthe prejudices of his people too strong to be overcome, he placed on\r\nrecord in the statute-book a declaration of his contempt for it and\r\na statement of his efforts to do away with it, while he was obliged\r\nto content himself with limiting the extent of its application, and\r\ndiminishing the penalties incurred by the defeated party.[312]\r\n\r\nWhile the laws of the Angles, the Saxons, and the Frisians bear ample\r\ntestimony to the general use of the wager of battle,[313] it is not a\r\nlittle singular that the duel appears to have been unknown among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. Employed so extensively as legal evidence throughout\r\ntheir ancestral regions, by the kindred tribes from which they sprang,\r\nand by the Danes and Norwegians who became incorporated with them;\r\nharmonizing, moreover, with their general habits and principles of\r\naction, it would seem impossible that they should not likewise have\r\npractised it. I can offer no explanation of the anomaly, and can only\r\nstate the bare fact that the judicial combat is not referred to in any\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Danish codes.[314] There seems, indeed, to\r\nbe no reason to doubt that its introduction into English jurisprudence\r\ndates only from the time of William the Conqueror.[315]\r\n\r\nThe Goths, while yet untainted by the influence of Rome, were no less\r\ngiven to the employment of the judicial duel than their Teutonic\r\nkindred, and Theodoric vainly endeavored to suppress the custom among\r\nthose of his subjects who had remained in Pannonia.[316] That no\r\ntrace of it is to be found among the extant laws of both Ostrogoths\r\nand Wisigoths, framed subsequently to their settlement in Italy,\r\nFrance, and Spain, is easily explained. The effect upon the invaders\r\nof the decaying but still majestic civilization of Rome, the Byzantine\r\neducation of Theodoric, the leader of the Ostrogoths, and his settled\r\npolicy of conciliating the Italians by maintaining as far as possible\r\nthe existing state of society, preclude any surprise that no allusion\r\nto the practice should occur in the short but sensible code known as\r\nthe “Edict of Theodoric,” which shows how earnestly that enlightened\r\nconqueror endeavored to fuse the invaders and the vanquished into one\r\nbody politic.[317] With regard to the Wisigoths, we must remember that\r\nearly conversion to Christianity and long intercourse with civilization\r\nhad already worn off much of the primitive ferocity of a race which\r\ncould produce in the fourth century such a man as Ulphilas. They were\r\nthe earliest of the invaders who succeeded in forming a permanent\r\noccupation of the conquered territories; and settling, as they did,\r\nin Narbonensian Gaul and Spain while the moral influence of Rome was\r\nyet all powerful, the imperial institutions exercised a much greater\r\neffect upon them than on the subsequent bands of Northern barbarians.\r\nAccordingly, we find their codes based almost entirely upon the Roman\r\njurisprudence, with such modifications as were essential to adapt it to\r\na ruder state of society. Their nicely balanced provisions and careful\r\ndistinctions offer a striking contrast to the shapeless legislation of\r\nthe races that followed, and neither the judicial combat nor canonical\r\ncompurgation found a place in them. Even the vulgar ordeal would appear\r\nto have been unknown until a period long subsequent to the conquest\r\nof Aquitaine by Clovis, and but little anterior to the overthrow of\r\nthe Gothic kingdom of Spain by the Saracens. But even as in Italy the\r\nLombard domination destroyed the results of Theodoric’s labors, so in\r\nFrance the introduction of the Frankish element revived the barbarian\r\ninstincts, and in the celebrated combat before Louis le Débonnaire,\r\nbetween Counts Bera and Sanila, who were both Goths, we find the\r\n“pugna duorum” claimed as an ancient privilege of the race, with the\r\ndistinction of its being equestrian, in accordance with Gothic usages,\r\nand so thoroughly was the guilt of Bera considered to be proved by\r\nhis defeat, that his name became adopted in the Catalan dialect as a\r\nsynonym of traitor.[318]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL USE OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wager of battle thus formed part of the ancestral institutions of\r\nall the races who founded the nations of Europe. With their conversion\r\nto Christianity the appeal was transferred from the heathen deities\r\nto God, who was expected to intervene and decide the battle in favor\r\nof the right.[319] It was an appeal to the highest court and popular\r\nconfidence in the arbitrament of the sword was rather strengthened than\r\ndiminished. Enlightened lawgivers not only shared, to a greater or\r\nless extent, in this confidence, but were also disposed to regard the\r\nduel with favor as the most practical remedy for the crime of false\r\nswearing which was everywhere prevalent. Thus Gundobald assumes that\r\nits introduction into the Burgundian code arose from this cause;[320]\r\nCharlemagne urged its use as greatly preferable to the shameless oaths\r\nwhich were taken with so much facility;[321] while Otho II., in 983,\r\nordered its employment in various forms of procedure for the same\r\nreason.[322] It can hardly be a source of surprise, in view of the\r\nwarlike manners of the times, and of the enormous evils for which a\r\npalliative was sought, that there was felt to be advantage in this\r\nmode of impressing upon principals and witnesses the awful sanctity of\r\nthe oath, thus entailing upon them the liability of supporting their\r\nasseverations by undergoing the risks of a combat rendered doubly\r\nsolemn by imposing religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nVarious causes were at work to extend the application of the judicial\r\nduel to all classes of cases. In the primitive codes of the barbarians,\r\nthere is no distinction made between civil and criminal law. Bodily\r\npunishment being almost unknown, except for slaves, and nearly all\r\ninfractions of the law being visited with fines, there was no necessity\r\nfor such niceties, the matter at stake in all cases being simply\r\nmoney or money’s worth. Accordingly, we find the wager of battle used\r\nindiscriminately, both as a defence against accusations of crime, and\r\nas a mode of settling cases of disputed property, real and personal.\r\nYet some of the earlier codes refer to it but seldom. The Salic law,\r\nas we have seen, hardly recognizes its existence; the Ripuarian code\r\nalludes to it but four times, and that of the Alamanni but six times.\r\nIn others, like the Baioarian, it is appealed to on almost every\r\noccasion, and among the Burgundians we may assume, from a remark of St.\r\nAgobard, that it superseded all evidence and rendered superfluous any\r\nattempt to bring forward witnesses.[323] This variation is probably\r\nrather apparent than real, and if in any of these bodies of laws there\r\nwere originally substantial limitations on its use, in time they\r\ndisappeared, for it was not difficult to find expedients to justify\r\nthe extension of a custom which accorded so perfectly with the temper\r\nof the age. How little reason was requisite to satisfy the belligerent\r\naspirations of justice is shown by a curious provision in the code\r\nof one of the Frisian tribes, by which a man unable to disprove an\r\naccusation of homicide was allowed to charge the crime on whomsoever\r\nhe might select, and then the question between them was decided by\r\ncombat.[324]\r\n\r\nThe elasticity, in fact, with which the duel lent itself to the\r\nadvantage of the turbulent and unscrupulous had no little influence in\r\nextending its sphere of action. This feature in its history is well\r\nexemplified in a document containing the proceedings of an assembly of\r\nlocal magnates, held in the year 888, to decide a contention concerning\r\nthe patronage of the church of Lessingon. After the testimony on one\r\nside had been given, the opposite party commenced in reply, when the\r\nleaders of the assembly, seizing their swords, vowed that they would\r\naffirm the truth of the first pleader’s evidence with their blood\r\nbefore King Arnoul and his court—and the case was decided without more\r\nado.[325] The strong and the bold are apt to be the ruling spirits in\r\nall ages, and were emphatically so in those periods of scarcely curbed\r\nviolence when the jurisprudence of the European commonwealths was\r\nslowly developing itself.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that means were readily found for extending\r\nthe jurisdiction of the wager of battle as widely as possible. One of\r\nthe most fruitful of these expedients was the custom of challenging\r\nwitnesses. The duel was a method of determining questions of perjury,\r\nand there was nothing to prevent a suitor, who saw his case going\r\nadversely, from accusing an inconvenient witness of false swearing\r\nand demanding the “campus” to prove it—a proceeding which adjourned\r\nthe main case, and likewise decided its result. This summary process,\r\nof course, brought every action within the jurisdiction of force,\r\nand deprived the judges of all authority to control the abuse. That\r\nit obtained at a very early period is shown by a form of procedure\r\noccurring in the Bavarian law, already referred to, by which the\r\nclaimant of an estate is directed to fight, not the defendant, but his\r\nwitness;[326] and in 819 a capitulary of Louis le Débonnaire gives\r\na formal privilege to the accused on a criminal charge to select\r\none of the witnesses against him with whom to decide the question\r\nin battle.[327] It is easy, therefore, to understand the custom,\r\nprescribed in some of the codes, by which witnesses were required to\r\ncome into court armed, and to have their weapons blessed on the altar\r\nbefore giving their testimony. If defeated they were fined, and were\r\nobliged to make good to the opposite party any damage which their\r\ntestimony, had it been successful, would have caused him.[328]\r\n\r\nNor was this merely a temporary extravagance. Late in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, after enlightened legislators had been strenuously and not\r\nunsuccessfully endeavoring to limit the abuse of the judicial combat,\r\nthe challenging of witnesses was still the favorite mode of escaping\r\nlegal condemnation.[329] Even in the fourteenth century, the municipal\r\nlaw of Reims, which allowed the duel between principals only in\r\ncriminal cases, permitted witnesses to be indiscriminately challenged\r\nand forced to fight, affording them the privilege of employing\r\nchampions only on the ground of physical infirmity or advanced\r\nage.[330] A still more bizarre extension of the practice, and one which\r\nwas most ingeniously adapted to defeat the ends of justice, is found\r\nin a provision of the English law of the thirteenth century, allowing\r\na man to challenge his own witnesses. Thus in many classes of crimes,\r\nsuch as theft, forgery, coining, etc., the accused could summon a\r\n“warrantor” from whom he professed to have received the articles which\r\nformed the basis of the accusation. The warrantor could scarcely give\r\nevidence in favor of the accused without assuming the responsibility\r\nhimself. If he refused, the accused was at liberty to challenge him; if\r\nhe gave the required evidence, he was liable to a challenge from the\r\naccuser.[331] The warrantor was sometimes also employed as a champion,\r\nand served for hire, but this service was illegal and when detected\r\ninvolved the penalties of perjury.[332] Another mode extensively used\r\nin France about the same time was to accuse the principal witness of\r\nsome crime rendering him incapable of giving testimony, when he was\r\nobliged to dispose of the charge by fighting, either personally or by\r\nchampion, in order to get his evidence admitted.[333]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to imagine any cases which might not thus be brought to\r\nthe decision of the duel; and the evidence of its universality is found\r\nin the restriction which prevented the appearance as witnesses of those\r\nwho could not be compelled to accept the combat. Thus the testimony of\r\nwomen and ecclesiastics was not receivable in lay courts in suits where\r\nappeal of battle might arise;[334] and when in the twelfth century\r\nspecial privileges were granted by the kings of France empowering serfs\r\nto bear testimony in court, the disability which prevented a serf from\r\nfighting with a freeman was declared annulled in such cases, as the\r\nevidence was only admissible when the witness was capable of supporting\r\nit by arms.[335]\r\n\r\nThe result of this system was that, in causes subject to such\r\nappeals, no witness could be forced to testify, by the French law\r\nof the thirteenth century, unless his principal entered into bonds\r\nto see him harmless in case of challenge, to provide a champion,\r\nand to make good all damages in case of defeat;[336] though it is\r\ndifficult to understand how this could be satisfactorily arranged,\r\nsince the penalties inflicted on a vanquished witness were severe,\r\nbeing, in civil causes, the loss of a hand and a fine at the pleasure\r\nof the suzerain, while in criminal actions “il perderoit le cors\r\navecques.”[337] The only limit to this abuse was that witnesses were\r\nnot liable to challenge in cases concerning matters of less value than\r\nfive sous and one denier.[338]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the position of a witness was thus rendered unenviable, that of the\r\njudge was little better. As though the duel had not received sufficient\r\nextension by the facilities for its employment just described, another\r\nmode of appealing to the sword in all cases was invented by which it\r\nbecame competent for the defeated party in any suit to challenge the\r\ncourt itself, and thus obtain a forcible reversal of judgment. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that this was not quite as absurd a practice as\r\nit may seem to us in modern times, for under the feudal system the\r\ndispensing of justice was one of the most highly prized attributes\r\nof sovereignty; and, except in England, where the royal judges were\r\nfrequently ecclesiastics, the seignorial courts were presided over\r\nby warriors. In Germany, indeed, where the magistrates of the lower\r\ntribunals were elective, they were required to be active and vigorous\r\nof body.[339] Towards the end of the twelfth century in England we\r\nfind Glanville acknowledging his uncertainty as to whether or not the\r\ncourt could depute the settlement of such an appeal to a champion,\r\nand also as to what, in case of defeat, was the legal position of\r\nthe court thus convicted of injustice.[340] These doubts would seem\r\nto indicate that the custom was still of recent introduction in\r\nEngland, and not as yet practised to an extent sufficient to afford a\r\nsettled basis of precedents for its details. Elsewhere, however, it\r\nwas firmly established. In 1195, the customs of St. Quentin allow to\r\nthe disappointed pleader unlimited recourse against his judge.[341]\r\nTowards the latter half of the thirteenth century, we find in the\r\n_Conseil_ of Pierre de Fontaines the custom in its fullest vigor and\r\njust on the eve of its decline. No restriction appears to be imposed\r\nas to the cases in which appeal by battle was permitted, except that\r\nit was not allowed to override the customary law.[342] The suitor\r\nselected any one of three judges agreeing in the verdict; he could\r\nappeal at any stage of the proceedings when a point was decided against\r\nhim; if unsuccessful, he was only liable in a pecuniary penalty to\r\nthe judges for the wrong done them, and the judge, if vanquished, was\r\nexposed to no bodily punishment.[343] The villein, however, was not\r\nentitled to the privilege, except by special charter.[344] While the\r\nfeudal system was supreme, this appeal to arms was the only mode of\r\nreversing a judgment, and an appeal in any other form was an innovation\r\nintroduced by the extension of the royal jurisdiction under St. Louis,\r\nwho labored so strenuously and so effectually to modify the barbarism\r\nof feudal institutions by subordinating them to the principles of the\r\nRoman jurisprudence. De Fontaines, indeed, states that he himself\r\nconducted the first case ever known in Vermandois of an appeal without\r\nbattle.[345] At the same time the progress of more rational ideas\r\nis manifested by his admission that the combat was not necessary to\r\nreverse a judgment manifestly repugnant to the law, and that, on the\r\nother hand, the law was not to be set aside by the duel.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, we find in Beaumanoir abundant evidence of the\r\nsuccess of St. Louis in setting bounds to the abuses which he was\r\nendeavoring to remove. The restrictions which he enumerates are greatly\r\nmore efficacious than those alluded to by de Fontaines. In capital\r\ncases, the appeal did not lie; while in civil actions, the suzerain\r\nbefore whom the appeal was made could refuse it when the justice of\r\nthe verdict was self-evident. Some caution, moreover, was requisite in\r\nconducting such cases, for the disappointed pleader who did not manage\r\nmatters rightly might find himself pledged to a combat, single handed,\r\nwith all his judges at once; and as the bench consisted of a collection\r\nof the neighboring gentry, the result might be the confirmation of the\r\nsentence in a manner more emphatic than agreeable. An important change\r\nis likewise observable in the severe penalty imposed upon a judge\r\nvanquished in such an appeal, being a heavy fine and deprivation of\r\nhis functions in civil cases, while in criminal ones it was death and\r\nconfiscation—“il pert le cors et quanques il a.”[346]\r\n\r\nThe king’s court, however, was an exception to the general rule. No\r\nappeals could be taken from its judgments, for there was no tribunal\r\nbefore which they could be carried.[347] The judges of the royal court\r\nwere therefore safe from the necessity of vindicating their decisions\r\nin the field, and they even carried this immunity with them and\r\ncommunicated it to those with whom they might be acting. De Fontaines\r\naccordingly advises the seigneur justicier who anticipates the appeal\r\nof battle in his court to obtain a royal judge to sit with him, and\r\nmentions an instance in which Philip (probably Philip Augustus) sent\r\nhis whole council to sit in the court of the Abbey of Corbie, when an\r\nappeal was to be entered.[348]\r\n\r\nBy the German law of the same period, the privilege of reversing a\r\nsentence by the sword existed, but accompanied with regulations which\r\nseem evidently designed to embarrass, by enormous trouble and expense,\r\nthe gratification of the impulse which disappointed suitors would have\r\nto establish their claims in such manner. Thus, by the Suabian law, it\r\ncould only be done in the presence of the sovereign himself, and not\r\nin that of the immediate feudal superior;[349] while the Saxon code\r\nrequires the extraordinary expedient of a pitched battle, with seven\r\non each side, in the king’s presence.[350] It is not a little singular\r\nthat the feudal law of the same period has no allusion to the custom,\r\nall appeals being regularly carried to and heard in the court of the\r\nsuzerain.[351]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THE JUDICIAL DUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus carefully moulded in conformity with the popular prejudices or\r\nconvictions of every age and country, it may readily be imagined\r\nhow large a part the judicial combat played in the affairs of daily\r\nlife. It was so skilfully interwoven throughout the whole system of\r\njurisprudence that no one could feel secure that he might not, at any\r\nmoment, as plaintiff, defendant, or witness, be called upon to protect\r\nhis estate or his life either by his own right hand or by the club\r\nof some professional and possibly treacherous bravo. This organized\r\nviolence assumed for itself the sanction of a religion of love and\r\npeace, and human intelligence seemed too much blunted to recognize the\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nThere was, in fact, no question which might not be submitted to the\r\narbitrament of the sword or club. If Charlemagne, in dividing his vast\r\nempire, forbade the employment of the wager of battle in settling the\r\nterritorial questions which might arise between his heirs,[352] the\r\nprohibition merely shows that it was habitually used in affairs of the\r\nhighest moment, and the constant reference to it in his laws proves\r\nthat it was in no way repugnant to his general sense of justice and\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nThe next century affords ample evidence of the growing favor in which\r\nthe judicial combat was held. About the year 930, Hugh, King of\r\nProvence and Italy, becoming jealous of his uterine brother, Lambert,\r\nDuke of Tuscany, asserted him to be a supposititious child, and ordered\r\nhim in future to claim no relationship between them. Lambert, being\r\n“vir ... bellicosus et ad quodlibet facinus audax,” contemptuously\r\ndenied the aspersion on his birth, and offered to clear all doubts on\r\nthe subject by the wager of battle. Hugh accordingly selected a warrior\r\nnamed Teudinus as his champion; Lambert was victor in the ensuing\r\ncombat, and was universally received as the undoubted son of his\r\nmother. His triumph, however, was illegally brought to a sudden close,\r\nfor Hugh soon after succeeded in making him prisoner and deprived him\r\nof eyesight.[353] Still, the practice continued to be denounced by some\r\nenlightened ecclesiastics, represented by Atto, Bishop of Vercelli,\r\nwho declared it to be totally inapplicable to churchmen and not to be\r\napproved for laymen on account of the uncertainty of its results;[354]\r\nbut representations of this kind were useless. About the middle of\r\nthe century, Otho the Great appears, throwing the enormous weight of\r\nhis influence in its favor. As a magnanimous and warlike prince, the\r\nwager of battle appears to have possessed peculiar attraction for\r\nhis chivalrous instincts, and he extended its application as far as\r\nlay in his power. Not only did he force his daughter Liutgarda, in\r\ndefending herself from a villanous accusation, to forego the safer\r\nmodes of purgation, and to submit herself to the perilous decision of a\r\ncombat,[355] but he also caused the abstract question of representation\r\nin the succession of estates to be settled in the same manner; and to\r\nthis day in Germany the division of a patrimony among children and\r\ngrandchildren is regulated in accordance with the law enacted by the\r\ndoughty arms of the champions who fought together nine hundred years\r\nago at Steil.[356] There was no question, indeed, which according to\r\nOtho could not be satisfactorily settled in this manner. Thus when, in\r\n963, he was indulging in the bitter recriminations with Pope John XII.\r\nwhich preceded the subjugation of the papacy under the Saxon emperors,\r\nhe had occasion to send Bishop Liutprand to Rome to repel certain\r\naccusations brought against him, and he ordered the armed followers of\r\nhis ambassador to sustain his assertions by the duel; a proposition\r\npromptly declined by the pontiff, skilled though he was in the use\r\nof weapons.[357] A duellist, in fact, seems to have been reckoned a\r\nnecessary adjunct to diplomacy, for when, in 968, the same Liutprand\r\nwas dispatched by Otho to Constantinople on a matrimonial mission,\r\nand during the negotiations for the hand of Theophania a discussion\r\narose as to the circumstances which had led to Otho’s conquest of\r\nItaly, the warlike prelate offered to prove his veracity by the sword\r\nof one of his attendants: a proposition which put a triumphant end to\r\nthe argument.[358] A more formal assertion of the diplomatic value of\r\nthe duel was made when in 1177 the conflicting claims of the kings\r\nof Castile and Navarre were referred to Henry II. of England for\r\nadjudication, and both embassies to the English court were supplied\r\nwith champions as well as with lawyers, so as to be prepared in case\r\nthe matter was submitted to the duel for decision.[359]\r\n\r\nNor were these solitary instances of the reference of the mightiest\r\nstate questions to the chances of the single combat. Allusion has\r\nalready been made to the challenge which passed between Charles of\r\nAnjou and Pedro of Aragon, and not dissimilar was that which resulted\r\nfrom the interview at Ipsch in 1053 between the Emperor Henry III. of\r\nGermany and Henry I. of France.[360] A hundred years earlier, in 948,\r\nwhen, at the Synod of Ingelheim, Louis d’Outremer invoked the aid of\r\nthe Church in his death-struggle with the rising race of Capet, he\r\nclosed the recital of the wrongs endured at the hands of Hugh le grand\r\nby offering to prove the justice of his complaints in single combat\r\nwith the aggressor.[361] When the battle ordeal was thus thoroughly\r\nincorporated in the manners of the age, we need scarcely be surprised\r\nthat, in a life of St. Matilda, written by command of her son Otho the\r\nGreat, the author, after describing the desperate struggles of the\r\nSaxons against Charlemagne, should gravely inform us that the war was\r\nat last concluded by a duel between the Christian hero and his great\r\nantagonist Witikind, religion and empire being both staked on the issue\r\nas a prize of the victor; nor does the pious chronicler shudder at the\r\nthought that the destiny of Christianity was intrusted to the sword\r\nof the Frank.[362] His story could not seem improbable to those who\r\nwitnessed in 1034 the efforts of Conrad the Salic to pacify the Saxon\r\nmarches. On his inquiring into the causes of the mutual devastations\r\nof the neighboring races, the Saxons, who were really the aggressors,\r\noffered to prove by the duel that the Pagan Luitzes were in fault,\r\ntrusting that their Christianity would overbalance the injustice of\r\ntheir cause. The defeat of their champion by his heathen adversary was,\r\nhowever, a memorable example of the impartial justice of God, and was\r\nreceived as a strong confirmation of the value of the battle trial.[363]\r\n\r\nThe second Otho was fully imbued with his father’s views, and so\r\ncompletely did he carry them out, that in a gloss on the Lombard law\r\nhe is actually credited with the introduction of the duel.[364] In\r\nthe preceding essay, allusion has been made to his substitution of\r\nthe judicial combat for the compurgatorial oath in 983, and about the\r\nsame period he made an exception, in favor of the battle ordeal, to\r\nthe immemorial policy of the barbarians which permitted to all subject\r\nraces the enjoyment of their ancestral usages. At the council of\r\nVerona, where all the nobles of Italy, secular and ecclesiastical, were\r\nassembled, he caused the adoption of a law which forced the Italians\r\nin this respect to follow the customs of their conquerors.[365] Even\r\nthe church was deprived of any exemption which she might previously\r\nhave enjoyed, and was only allowed the privilege of appearing by her\r\n_advocati_ or champions.[366] There were small chances of escape\r\nfrom the stringency of these regulations, for an edict of Otho I. in\r\n971 had decreed the punishment of confiscation against any one who\r\nshould refuse to undergo the chances of the combat.[367] It may even\r\nbe assumed, from the wording of a constitution of the Emperor Henry\r\nII., that in the early part of the eleventh century it was no longer\r\nnecessary that there should be a doubt as to the guilt of the accused\r\nto entitle him to the privileges of the combat, and that even the most\r\nnotorious criminal could have a chance of escape by an appeal to the\r\nsword.[368]\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that nearly every question that could possibly\r\narise was finally deemed liable to the decision of the wager of battle.\r\nIf Otho the Great employed champions to legislate respecting a disputed\r\npoint of law, he was not more eccentric than the Spaniards, who settled\r\nin the same manner a controversy regarding the canonical observances\r\nof religion, when Gregory VII. endeavored to force the introduction\r\nof the Roman liturgy into Castile and Leon, in lieu of the national\r\nGothic or Mozarabic rite. With considerable difficulty, some years\r\nbefore, Navarre and Aragon had been led to consent to the change, but\r\nthe Castilians were doggedly attached to the observances of their\r\nancestors, and stoutly refused compliance. In 1077, Alfonso I. procured\r\nthe assent of a national council, but the people rebelled, and after\r\nrepeated negotiations the matter was finally referred to the umpirage\r\nof the sword. The champion of the Gothic ritual was victorious, and\r\ntradition adds that a second trial was made by the ordeal of fire;\r\na missal of each kind was thrown into the flames, and the national\r\nliturgy emerged triumphantly unscathed.[369]\r\n\r\nNearly contemporary with this was the celebrated case of Otho, Duke\r\nof Bavaria, perhaps the most noteworthy example of a judicial appeal\r\nto the sword. A worthless adventurer, named Egeno, accused Otho of\r\nconspiring against the life of Henry IV. In a diet held at Mainz, the\r\nduke was commanded to disprove the charge by doing battle with his\r\naccuser within six weeks. According to some authorities, his pride\r\nrevolted at meeting an adversary so far his inferior; according to\r\nothers, he was prevented from appearing in the lists only by the\r\nrefusal of the emperor to grant him a safe conduct. Be this as it may,\r\nthe appointed term elapsed, his default of appearance caused judgment\r\nto be taken against him, and his duchy was accordingly confiscated. It\r\nwas bestowed on Welf, son of Azo d’Este and of Cunigunda, descendant\r\nand heiress of the ancient Guelfic Agilolfings; and thus, on the basis\r\nof a judicial duel, was founded the second Bavarian house of Guelf,\r\nfrom which have sprung so many royal and noble lines, including their\r\nGuelfic Majesties of Britain. Some years later, the emperor himself\r\noffered to disprove by the same means a similar accusation brought\r\nagainst him by a certain Reginger, of endeavoring to assassinate his\r\nrival, Rodolph of Suabia. Ulric of Cosheim, however, who was involved\r\nin the accusation, insisted on taking his place, and a day was\r\nappointed for the combat, which was prevented only by the opportune\r\ndeath of Reginger.[370]\r\n\r\nScarcely less impressive in its results, and even more remarkable\r\nin itself, as exhibiting the duel invested with legislative as well\r\nas judicial functions, is the case wherein the wager of battle was\r\nemployed in 1180 to break the overgrown power of Henry the Lion. That\r\npuissant Duke of Saxony and Bavaria had long divided the power of the\r\nempire and defied the repeated efforts of Frederic Barbarossa to punish\r\nhis constantly recurring rebellions. Cited to appear and answer for\r\nhis treasons in successive diets, he constantly refused, on the plea\r\nthat the law required him to have a trial within his own dominions.\r\nAt length, in the diet of Würzburg, a noble arose and declared\r\nhimself ready to prove by the single combat that the emperor could\r\nlegally cite his princes before him at any place that he might select\r\nwithin the limits of the empire. Of course there was none to take up\r\nthe challenge, and Frederic was enabled to erect the principle thus\r\nasserted into a binding law. Henry was condemned by default, and his\r\nconfiscated possessions were shared between those who had arranged and\r\nenacted the comedy.[371]\r\n\r\nNo rank of life in fact procured exemption from the duel between\r\nantagonists of equal station. When in 1002, on the death of Otho III.,\r\nthe German throne was filled by the election of Henry the Lame, Duke\r\nof Bavaria, one of his disappointed competitors, Hermann, Duke of\r\nSuabia, is said to have demanded that their respective claims should\r\nbe determined by a judicial combat, and the new king, feeling himself\r\nbound to accept the wager of battle, proceeded to the appointed place,\r\nand waited in vain for the appearance of his antagonist.[372] Thus the\r\nchampion of England, who until 1821 figured in the coronation pageant\r\nof Westminster Abbey, was a relic of the times when it was not an\r\nidle ceremony for the armed and mounted knight to fling the gauntlet\r\nand proclaim aloud that he was ready to do battle with any one who\r\nchallenged the right of the new monarch to his crown.[373] A striking\r\nexample of the liability attaching to even the most exalted rank is\r\nafforded by a declaration of the privileges of the Duchy of Austria,\r\ngranted by Frederic Barbarossa in 1156, and confirmed by Frederic II.\r\nin 1245. These privileges rendered the dukes virtually independent\r\nsovereigns, and among them is enumerated the right of employing a\r\nchampion to represent the reigning duke when summoned to the judicial\r\nduel.[374] Even more instructive is the inference deducible from the\r\nFor de Morlaas, granted to his subjects by Gaston IV. of Béarn about\r\nthe year 1100. The privileges contained in it are guaranteed by a\r\nclause providing that, should they be infringed by the prince, the\r\ninjured subject shall substantiate his complaint by his simple oath,\r\nand shall not be compelled to prove the illegality of the sovereign’s\r\nacts by the judicial combat, thus indicating a pre-existing custom of\r\nthe duel between the prince and his vassals.[375]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, however, from these instances that the duel\r\nwas an aristocratic institution, reserved for nobles and affairs of\r\nstate. It was an integral part of the ordinary law, both civil and\r\ncriminal, employed habitually for the decision of the most every-day\r\naffairs. Thus a chronicler happens to mention that in 1017 the Emperor\r\nSt. Henry II. coming to Merseburg hanged a number of robbers who had\r\nbeen convicted in single combat by champions, and then proceeding to\r\nMagdeburg he had all the thieves assembled and treated them in the same\r\nmanner.[376] So much was it a matter of course, that, by the English\r\nlaw of the thirteenth century, a pleader was sometimes allowed to alter\r\nthe record of his preliminary plea, by producing a man who would offer\r\nto prove with his body that the record was incorrect, the sole excuse\r\nfor the absurdity being that it was only allowed in matters which\r\ncould not injure the other side;[377] and a malefactor turning king’s\r\nevidence was obliged, before receiving his pardon, to pledge himself to\r\nconvict all his accomplices, if required, by the duel.[378]\r\n\r\nThe habitual use of such a method of administering justice required\r\nno little robustness of faith in the expected intervention of God to\r\ncontrol the event. Even in the fifteenth century, when the combat was\r\nrapidly becoming obsolete, this faith is pictorially embodied in an\r\nilluminated MS. of Tallhöfer’s Kamp-recht, where a miniature represents\r\nthe victor kneeling and returning thanks to God, while the vanquished\r\nis lying on his back with Satan grasping at his open mouth as though\r\nalready seizing the soul of the criminal.[379] This robustness of\r\nfaith was proof against experience and common sense, and sought to\r\nexplain the frequent miscarriage of justice by any process of reasoning\r\nrather than the right one. Thus about the year 1100 a sacrilegious\r\nthief named Anselm stole the sacred vessels from the church of Laon\r\nand sold them to a merchant, from whom he exacted an oath of secrecy.\r\nFrightened at the excommunications fulminated by the authorities of the\r\nplundered church, the unhappy trader revealed the name of the robber.\r\nAnselm denied the accusation, offered the wager of battle, defeated\r\nthe unfortunate receiver of stolen goods, and was proclaimed innocent.\r\nEncouraged by impunity, he repeated the offence, and after his\r\nconviction by the ordeal of cold water he confessed the previous crime.\r\nThe doubts cast by this event on the efficacy of the judicial combat\r\nwere, however, happily removed by the suggestion that the merchant had\r\nsuffered for the violation of the oath which he had sworn to Anselm,\r\nand the reputation of the duel remained intact.[380]\r\n\r\nThe frequent cases of this nature often did not admit of so ingenious\r\nan explanation of the criminal’s escape, and legal casuists assumed\r\na condition of being, guilty in the sight of God, but not in that of\r\nman—a refinement of speculation which even finds place in the German\r\ncodes of the thirteenth century;[381] and men contented themselves\r\nthen, as they do still, with predicting future misfortunes and an\r\neternity of punishment. The more direct solution, in cases of unjust\r\ncondemnation, was very much like that which justified the defeat of\r\nAnselm’s merchant—that the unfortunate victim, though innocent of the\r\nspecial offence charged, suffered in consequence of other sins. This\r\ndoctrine was even supported by the infallible authority of the papacy,\r\nas enunciated in 1203 by Innocent III. in a case wherein the priory\r\nof St. Sergius was unjustly convicted of theft by the judicial duel,\r\nand its possessions were consequently seized by the authorities of\r\nSpoleto.[382]\r\n\r\nAn example justifying this theory is found in the case of Henry of\r\nEssex in 1163. He was a favorite of Henry II. and one of the most\r\npowerful nobles of his day, till he was accused of treason by his\r\nkinsman Robert de Montfort for having abandoned his king when in\r\ndesperate straits in the Welsh war of 1157. A duel ensued, fought\r\non an island of the Thames near Reading, in presence of an immense\r\nassemblage. Henry had been a bad neighbor to the Abbey of St. Edmund,\r\nand when engaged in the desperate contest he was dismayed at seeing the\r\nangry saint hovering in the air and threatening him; nor was this all,\r\nfor Gilbert de Cerivilla, whom he had unjustly put to death, likewise\r\nappeared and menaced him. The inevitable result of this was his defeat;\r\nhe was left for dead on the field, but at the instance of his powerful\r\nkindred his body was allowed Christian burial in the Abbey of Reading.\r\nCarried thither he unexpectedly revived and embraced a religious life\r\nin the abbey, where years afterwards he related the story of his\r\ndiscomfiture to the veracious chronicler who has handed it down.[383]\r\n\r\nThat the combatants themselves did not always feel implicit confidence\r\nin the event, or rely solely upon the righteousness of their cause, is\r\nshown by the custom of occasionally bribing Heaven either to assist\r\nthe right or to defend the wrong. Thus, in the eleventh century, we\r\nfind the monastery of St. Peter at Bèze in the enjoyment of certain\r\nlands bestowed on the Saint by Sir Miles the Stammerer, who in this\r\nway endeavored to purchase his assistance in a combat about to take\r\nplace—a bargain no doubt highly appreciated by the worthy monks.[384]\r\nAccording to the belief of the pious, Heaven might be propitiated by\r\nless venal means, for Cæsarius of Heisterbach relates on the authority\r\nof an eye-witness that when Henry VI. entered Lombardy in 1196, a\r\ncastellan was accused before him of oppression and rapine by his\r\nneighbors, who produced a champion of enormous size to vindicate their\r\ncase. The Emperor decreed the battle, when the brother of the accused\r\noffered himself for the defence—a slender and most unequal antagonist.\r\nHe prepared himself for the strife, however, by assiduous confession\r\nand prayer, and easily overcame his huge adversary; and thus, exclaims\r\nthe worthy chronicler, a guilty man escaped the death he had deserved,\r\nsolely by virtue of the humble confession of his brother.[385] Cæsarius\r\nalso mentions another case, in a duel decreed by Frederic Barbarossa\r\nbetween a knight and a gigantic champion, where the inequality was\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the fact that the knight piously took the\r\nprecaution of receiving the sacrament before entering the lists, and\r\nthus was enabled to overcome his adversary.[386]\r\n\r\nLess creditable means were sometimes employed, and men did not\r\nhesitate, with the unreasoning inconsistency characteristic of\r\nsuperstition, to appeal to God and at the same time endeavor to\r\ninfluence God’s judgment by the use of unlawful expedients. This\r\nwas not confined to the laity. In 1355 there was an important suit\r\nbetween the Bishop of Salisbury and the Earl of Salisbury respecting\r\nthe ownership of a castle, in which the combat was adjudged. When\r\nthe champions entered the lists the customary examination of their\r\narms and accoutrements was made, and the combat was adjourned in\r\nconsequence, as it was said, of finding in the coat of the episcopal\r\nchampion certain rolls containing prayers and charms. The case was\r\nfinally compromised by the bishop paying fifteen hundred marks to the\r\nearl for the disputed property.[387] That precautions against such\r\ndevices were deemed necessary is shown by the oath required of all\r\ncombatants, whether principals or champions, that they had on them no\r\ncharms or conjurations to affect the result.[388] A quaint formula for\r\nthis is the oath of the champion in the case of Low _vs._ Paramore in\r\n1571—“This hear you justices that I have this day neither eat, drunk,\r\nnor have upon me either bone, stone, ne glass or any enchantment,\r\nsorcery, or witchcraft where-through the power of the Word of God might\r\nbe inleased or diminished and the devil’s power increased, and that my\r\nappeal is true, so help me God and his saints and by this Book.”[389]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS ON THE WAGER OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right of demanding the wager of battle between principals varied\r\nmuch with the age and race, though as a “bilateral” ordeal, as a rule,\r\nfrom the earliest times either party was entitled to claim it.[390]\r\nWhen Beaumanoir composed his _Coutumes du Beauvoisis_, in 1283, the\r\npractice may be considered to have entered upon its decadence; twenty\r\nyears had elapsed since the determined efforts of St. Louis to abolish\r\nit; substitutes for it in legal processes had been provided; and the\r\nmanner in which that enlightened jurist manifests his preference for\r\npeaceful forms of law shows that he fully appreciated the civilizing\r\nspirit in which the monarch had endeavored to soften the ferocity of\r\nhis subjects. When, therefore, we see in Beaumanoir’s treatise how\r\nfew restrictions existed in his time, we may comprehend the previous\r\nuniversality of the custom. In criminal cases, if an accuser offered\r\nbattle, the defendant was forced either to accept it or to confess\r\nhis guilt, unless he could prove an alibi, or unless the accuser was\r\nhimself notoriously guilty of the crime in question, and the accusation\r\nwas evidently a mere device to shift the guilt to the shoulders of\r\nanother; or unless, in case of murder, the victim had disculpated\r\nhim, when dying, and had named the real criminals.[391] If, on the\r\nother hand, the accused demanded to wage his battle, the judge could\r\nonly refuse it when his guilt was too notorious for question.[392] A\r\nserf could not challenge a freeman, nor a bastard a man of legitimate\r\nbirth (though an appeal of battle might lie between two bastards),\r\nnor a leper a sound man.[393] In civil actions, the battle trial was\r\nnot allowed in cases relating to dower, to orphans under age,[394] to\r\nguardianships, or to the equity of redemption afforded by the feudal\r\nlaws to kinsmen in the sale of heritable property, or where the matter\r\nat stake was of less value than twelve deniers.[395] St. Louis also\r\nprohibited the duel between brothers in civil cases, while permitting\r\nit in criminal accusations.[396] The slenderness of these restrictions\r\nshows what ample opportunities were afforded to belligerent\r\npleaders.[397]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as a general rule, either party had a right to demand\r\nthe judicial combat,[398] subject, however, in practice, to several\r\nimportant limitations. Thus, difference of rank between the parties\r\nafforded the superior a right to decline a challenge, as we shall see\r\nmore fully hereafter.[399] Relationship between the contestants was\r\nalso an impediment, of which either might avail himself,[400] and\r\neven the fact that the defendant was not a native of the territory\r\nin which the action was brought gave him the privilege of refusing\r\nthe appeal.[401] Still, we find the principle laid down even in the\r\nfourteenth century that cases of homicide could not be determined in\r\nany other manner.[402] There were circumstances, indeed, in which the\r\ncomplainant, if he could bring the evidence of seven witnesses in his\r\nfavor, could decline the duel; but if he choose to prove the charge\r\nby the combat, no examination or testimony was admitted. In the same\r\nway, if a man was slain while committing theft or robbery, and was\r\nprosecuted for the crime, the accuser was not bound to offer the duel\r\nif he could produce the evidence of seven witnesses; but if a relative\r\nof the dead man offered to vindicate him by combat, this annulled\r\nall the evidence, and conviction could not be had without the battle\r\nordeal.[403] A curious provision in the Saxon burgher law allowed a\r\nman who had been assaulted to challenge to the duel as many men as he\r\nhad wounds—but the wounds were required to be of a certain degree of\r\nseverity—_wunden kampffbaren_.[404] So the contemporary law of Suabia\r\nprovides that in accusations of personal violence, the duel was not to\r\nbe allowed, unless the injury inflicted on the complainant had been\r\nsufficiently serious to cause permanent maiming,[405] thus showing how\r\nthoroughly different in spirit was the judicial combat from the modern\r\ncode of honor which has been affiliated upon it. Yet a general rule is\r\nfound expressed to the effect that it was necessary only in cases where\r\nno other evidence was obtainable, when the result could be safely left\r\nto the judgment of Omniscience.[406]\r\n\r\nIn the Latin kingdoms of the East, and among the Armenians, who,\r\ncuriously enough, adopted the customs of their fellow Christians from\r\nthe West, it would seem that in both the noble and the roturier courts,\r\nin civil as well as in criminal cases, the plaintiff or prosecutor\r\nwas not obliged personally to fight, but that if one of his witnesses\r\noffered battle, the defendant or accused was not permitted to decline\r\nthe challenge under pain of losing his suit or being condemned. On the\r\nother hand, unless the complainant or accuser had a witness who was\r\nwilling to offer battle, the oath of denial of the other party was\r\nsufficient, and in criminal cases the accuser was subjected to the\r\n_talio_.[407]\r\n\r\nBy the English law of the thirteenth century, a man accused of crime\r\nhad, in doubtful cases only, the right of election between trial by\r\njury and the wager of battle. When a violent presumption existed\r\nagainst him, he was obliged to submit to the verdict of a jury; but\r\nin cases of suspected poisoning, as satisfactory evidence was deemed\r\nunattainable, the accused had only the choice between confession\r\nand the combat.[408] On the other hand, when the appellant demanded\r\nthe duel, he was obliged to make out a probable case before it was\r\ngranted.[409] When battle had been gaged, however, no withdrawal was\r\npermitted, and any composition between the parties to avoid it was\r\npunishable by fine and imprisonment[410]—a regulation, no doubt,\r\nintended to prevent pleaders from rashly undertaking it, and to obviate\r\nits abuse as a means of extortion. In accusations of treason, indeed,\r\nthe royal consent alone could prevent the matter from being fought\r\nout.[411] Any bodily injury on the part of the plaintiff, tending to\r\nrender him less capable of defence or aggression, likewise deprived\r\nthe defendant of the right to the wager of battle, and this led to\r\nsuch nice distinctions that the loss of molar teeth was adjudged not\r\nto amount to disqualification, while the absence of incisors was\r\nconsidered sufficient excuse, because they were held to be important\r\nweapons of offence.[412] Notwithstanding these various restrictions,\r\ncases of treason were almost always determined by the judicial duel,\r\naccording to both Glanville and Bracton.[413] This was in direct\r\nopposition to the custom of Lombardy, where such cases were especially\r\nexempted from decision by the sword.[414] These restrictions of the\r\nEnglish law, such as they were, did not, however, extend to the\r\nScottish Marches, where the trial by battle was the universal resource\r\nand no proof by witnesses was admitted.[415]\r\n\r\nIn Bearn, the duel was permitted at the option of the accuser in\r\ncases of murder and treason, but in civil suits only in default of\r\ntestimony.[416] That in such cases it was in common use is shown by\r\na treaty made, in the latter part of the eleventh century, between\r\nCentulla I. of Bearn and the Viscount of Soule, in which all doubtful\r\nquestions arising between their respective subjects are directed to be\r\nsettled by the combat, with the singular proviso that the combatants\r\nshall be men who have never taken part in war.[417] In the thirteenth\r\ncentury, however, a provision occurs which must have greatly reduced\r\nthe number of duels, as it imposed a fine of only sixteen sous on the\r\nparty who made default, while, if vanquished, he was visited with\r\na mulct of sixty sous and the forfeiture of his arms.[418] In the\r\nneighboring region of Bigorre an exemption was allowed in favor of the\r\nwidow whose husband had been slain in war. Until she remarried or her\r\nsons were of age to bear arms she was exempt from all legal process—a\r\nprovision evidently intended to relieve her from the duel in which\r\nsuits were liable to terminate.[419]\r\n\r\nIn some regions greater restrictions were imposed on the facility for\r\nsuch appeals to the sword. In Catalonia, for instance, the judge alone\r\nhad the power of deciding whether they should be permitted,[420] and a\r\nsimilar right was reserved in doubtful cases to the podestà in a code\r\nof laws in force at Verona in 1228.[421] This must often have prevented\r\nthe injustice inherent in the system, and an equally prudent reserve\r\nwas exhibited in a statute of Montpellier, which required the assent of\r\nboth parties.[422] On the other hand, in Normandy, at the commencement\r\nof the thirteenth century, many cases relating to real estate were\r\nexamined in the first instance by a jury of twelve men, and, if they\r\nfailed of an unanimous verdict, the question was decided by the duel,\r\nwhether the parties were willing or not.[423]\r\n\r\nBy the criminal procedure in England, at about the same period, the\r\nduel was prescribed only for cases of felony or crimes of importance,\r\nand it was forbidden in trifling misdemeanors.[424] Appeal of battle\r\ncould not lie between a vassal and his lord during the existence of\r\nthe connection, nor between a serf and his master except in cases of\r\ntreason.[425] It would also seem that the defendant could avoid the\r\nduel if he could prove that the motive of the appeal was hatred, for\r\nthere is a curious case on record in which, when the appellant demanded\r\nbattle, the accused offered to the king a silver mark for an impartial\r\njury to decide this preliminary question, and it was granted to\r\nhim.[426] In Southern Germany a fifteenth century MS. enumerates seven\r\ncrimes for which the duel could be prescribed—detraction of the emperor\r\nor empire, treason, theft, robbery and depredation, rape, arson, and\r\npoisoning.[427]\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period, a minimum limit of value was established,\r\nbelow which a pugnacious pleader was not allowed to put the life or\r\nlimb of his adversary in jeopardy. This varied of course with the\r\nrace and the period. Thus, among the Angli and Werini, the lowest\r\nsum for which the combat was permitted was two solidi,[428] while\r\nthe Baioarians established the limit at the value of a cow.[429] In\r\nthe tenth century, Otho II. decided that six solidi should be the\r\nsmallest sum worth fighting for.[430] The so-called laws of Henry I.\r\nof England decreed that in civil cases the appeal of battle should\r\nnot lie for an amount less than ten solidi.[431] In France, Louis\r\nle Jeune, by an edict of 1168, forbade the duel when the sum in\r\ndebate was less than five sous,[432] and this remained in force for\r\nat least a century.[433] The custom of Normandy in the thirteenth\r\ncentury specifies ten sous as the line of demarcation between the\r\n_lex apparens_ and the _lex simplex_ in civil suits,[434] and the\r\nsame provision retains its place in the Coutumier in use until the\r\nsixteenth century.[435] In the Latin States of the East founded by\r\nthe Crusaders, the minimum was a silver marc in cases of both nobles\r\nand roturiers.[436] A law of Aragon, in 1247, places the limit at ten\r\nsous.[437]\r\n\r\nAs regards the inferior classes of society, innumerable documents\r\nattest the right of peasants to decide their quarrels by the ordeal\r\nof battle. By the old Lombard law, slaves were allowed to defend\r\nthemselves in this manner;[438] and they could even employ the duel\r\nto claim their liberty from their masters, as we may infer from a law\r\nof King Grimoald denying this privilege to those who could be proved\r\nto have served the same master for thirty continuous years.[439]\r\nSimilarly, among the Frisians, a _litus_ claiming his liberty was\r\nallowed to prove it against his master with arms.[440] The institutions\r\nof feudalism widened the distance between the different classes of\r\nsociety, and we have already seen that, in the thirteenth century,\r\nserfs were enfranchised in order to enable them to support their\r\ntestimony by the combat; yet this was only the result of inequality of\r\nrank. In the time of Beaumanoir (1283), though an appeal would not lie\r\nfrom a serf to a freeman, it may be safely inferred from the context\r\nthat a combat could be legally decreed between two serfs if the consent\r\nof their masters were obtained,[441] and other contemporary authorities\r\nshow that a man claimed as a serf could defend his freedom with the\r\nsword against his would-be master.[442] Even Jews were held liable to\r\nthe appeal of battle, as we learn from a decision of 1207, preserved\r\nin an ancient register of assizes in Normandy,[443] and they no doubt\r\npurchased the exemption, which was granted to them, except in cases of\r\nflagrant murder, by Philippe le Long, as a special favor, in 1317.[444]\r\n\r\nDifference of condition thus became an impediment to the duel, and\r\nformed the subject of many regulations, varying with circumstance and\r\nlocality. The free mountaineers of Béarn, as has been seen, placed the\r\nprince and the subject on an equality before the law, but this was\r\na rare example of independence, and the privileges of station were\r\nsometimes exhibited in their most odious form. In France, for instance,\r\nwhile the battle trial could take place between the gentilhomme and\r\nthe _vilain_, the former was secured by the distinction that if the\r\nvillein presumed to challenge him, he enjoyed the right of fighting on\r\nhorseback with knightly weapons, while the challenger was on foot and\r\narmed only with shield and staff; but if the gentleman condescended\r\nto challenge the villein, they met on equal terms.[445] This last\r\nregulation was enforced with impartial justice, for Beaumanoir mentions\r\na case in which a gentleman challenged a roturier, and presented\r\nhimself in the lists mounted and armed with his knightly weapons. The\r\ndefendant protested against this illegal advantage, and the judges\r\ndecided that the gentleman had forfeited his horse and arms, and that\r\nif he desired to continue the combat he must do so in the condition\r\nin which he was left by the disarmament—in his shirt without armor\r\nor weapons, while his adversary should retain coat of mail, target,\r\nand club.[446] The barbarous injustice of the general rule, moreover,\r\nwas by no means of universal application. Pierre de Fontaines, for\r\ninstance, directs that in cases of appeal from a roturier to a\r\ngentleman the combat shall take place on foot between champions;[447]\r\nand I find a case recorded in 1280, in which a _femme de corps_ of\r\nAimeri de Rochechouart accused the Sire de Montricher of burning her\r\nhouses, and as the duel was adjudged she placed in the lists an armed\r\nand mounted knight as her champion, to whom no objection seems to have\r\nbeen made.[448]\r\n\r\nThroughout both Northern and Southern Germany, where the minute\r\ndistinctions of birth were guarded with the most jealous care from\r\na very early period, the codes of the thirteenth century, including\r\neven the burgher laws, provided that a difference of rank permitted\r\nthe superior to decline the challenge of an inferior, while the latter\r\nwas obliged to accept the appeal of the former. So thoroughly was\r\nthis principle carried into practice, that, to compel the appearance\r\nof a _Semperfri_, or noble of sixteen quarterings, the appellant was\r\nrequired to prove himself of equally untarnished descent.[449] In the\r\nsame spirit a Jew could not decline the appeal of battle offered by a\r\nChristian accuser, though we may safely infer that the Jew could not\r\nchallenge the Christian.[450] So, in the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem,\r\nthe Greek, the Syrian, and the Saracen could not challenge the Frank,\r\nbut could not, in criminal cases, decline his challenge, though they\r\nmight do so in civil suits.[451] In Aragon, no judicial duel was\r\npermitted between a Christian and a Jew or a Saracen,[452] while in\r\nCastile both combatants had to be gentlemen, quarrels between parties\r\nof different ranks being settled by the courts.[453] On the other\r\nhand, in Wales, extreme difference of rank was held to render the duel\r\nnecessary, as in cases of treason against a lord, for there the lord\r\nwas plaintiff against his vassal, and as no man could enter into law\r\nwith his lord, the combat was considered the only mode of prosecution\r\nbefitting his dignity.[454]\r\n\r\nA question of this nature was the remote occasion of the murder of\r\nCharles the Good, Count of Flanders, in 1127. Bertulf, Provost of the\r\nchurch of Bruges, was rich and powerful, although in reality his family\r\nwere villeins of the count. He married his nieces to knights, one of\r\nwhom, in presence of the count, appealed another knight to battle.\r\nThe appellee refused on the ground that he was not obliged to notice\r\nthe challenge of a villein, for according to the law of the land a\r\nfreeman marrying a serf was reduced to the latter condition after the\r\nexpiration of a year. The Count’s attention being thus called to his\r\nrights over the family of Bertulf, he proceeded to establish them, when\r\nBertulf set on foot the conspiracy which ended in the assassination of\r\nthe count.[455]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were three classes—women, ecclesiastics, and those suffering\r\nunder physical incapacity—with whom personal appearance in the lists\r\nwould appear to be impossible. When interested in cases involving the\r\njudicial duel they were therefore allowed the privilege of substituting\r\na champion, who took their place and did battle for the justice of\r\ntheir cause. So careful were legislators to prevent any failure in the\r\nprocedure prescribed by custom, that the North German law provided that\r\nthe dead when prosecuted could appear in the lists by substitutes,[456]\r\nand the Assises de Jerusalem ordered the suzerain to supply the\r\nexpenses for forty days, when a suitor unable to fight was also too\r\npoor to pay for a champion to take his place; and when a murdered man\r\nleft no relatives to prosecute the murderer, the suzerain was likewise\r\nobliged to furnish the champion in any trial that might arise.[457]\r\nEqually directed to the same purpose was the German law which provided\r\nthat when a crippled defendant refused or neglected to procure a\r\nsubstitute, the judge was to seize one-half of his property with which\r\nto pay the services of a gladiator, who could claim nothing more.[458]\r\nGuardians of women and minors, moreover, were bound to furnish battle\r\nin their behalf.[459]\r\n\r\nWomen, however, did not always restrict themselves to fighting thus\r\nvicariously. The German laws refer to cases in which a woman might\r\ndemand justice of a man personally in the lists, and not only are\r\ninstances on record in which this was done, as in a case at Berne\r\nin 1228, in which the woman was the victor,[460] but it was of\r\nsufficiently frequent occurrence to have an established mode of\r\nprocedure, which is preserved to us in all its details by illuminated\r\nMSS. of the period.[461] The chances between such unequal adversaries\r\nwere adjusted by placing the man up to the navel in a pit three feet\r\nwide, tying his left hand behind his back, and arming him only with a\r\nclub, while his fair opponent had the free use of her limbs and was\r\nfurnished with a stone as large as the fist, or weighing from one\r\nto five pounds, fastened in a piece of stuff. A curious regulation\r\nprovided the man with three clubs. If in delivering a blow he touched\r\nthe earth with hand or arm he forfeited one of the clubs; if this\r\nhappened thrice his last weapon was gone, he was adjudged defeated, and\r\nthe woman could order his execution. On the other hand, the woman was\r\nsimilarly furnished with three weapons. If she struck the man while\r\nhe was disarmed she forfeited one, and with the loss of the third she\r\nwas at his mercy, and was liable to be buried alive. According to the\r\ncustoms of Freisingen these combats were reserved for accusations of\r\nrape. If the man was vanquished, he was beheaded; if the woman, she\r\nonly lost a hand, for the reason that the chances of the fight were\r\nagainst her.[462] In Bohemia, also, women over the age of eighteen\r\nhad the privilege of the duel; the man was put into a pit as deep as\r\nhis waist; the woman was armed with sword and buckler, but was not\r\nallowed to approach nearer than a circle traced around the mouth of the\r\npit.[463]\r\n\r\nThe liability of ecclesiastics to the duel varied with the varying\r\nrelations between the church and state. As early as the year 819,\r\nLouis le Débonnaire, in his additions to the Salic law, directs that,\r\nin doubtful cases arising between laymen and ecclesiastics, the duel\r\nbetween chosen witnesses shall be employed, but that when both parties\r\nare clerical it shall be forbidden.[464] This restriction was not long\r\nobserved. A decree of the Emperor Guy, in 892, gives to churchmen the\r\nprivilege of settling their quarrels either by combat or by witnesses,\r\nas they might prefer;[465] and, about the year 945, Atto of Vercelli\r\ncomplains that the tribunals allowed to ecclesiastics no exemption\r\nfrom the prevailing custom.[466] As we have seen (p. 131), Otho II.,\r\nat the Council of Verona in 983, subjected the churches to the law of\r\nthe duel, only granting them the privilege of employing champions. Some\r\nintricate questions involved in the coexistence of the Lombard and the\r\nRoman law arose in a celebrated case between the Abbey of Farfa and\r\nthat of SS. Cosmo and Damianus of Rome, which was pleaded in 998 and\r\n999 before Otho III. and Popes Gregory V. and Sylvester II. The Abbey\r\nof Farfa proved that it lived under the Lombard law, while the other\r\nwas under the Roman law. It was decided, as the Abbey of Farfa desired,\r\nthat after hearing testimony the case should be settled by the duel,\r\nbut the witnesses of the Roman abbey were so manifestly perjured that\r\nit was held not to have made out a case justifying an appeal to the\r\ncombat, and the churches in dispute were adjudged to Farfa.[467]\r\n\r\nSo far was this liability to the duel from being deemed a hardship\r\nby the turbulent spirits of the period, that clerks not infrequently\r\ndisdained to sustain their rights by the intervention of a champion,\r\nand boldly entered the lists themselves. In 1080 the Synod of\r\nLillebonne adopted a canon punishing by a fine such belligerent\r\nchurchmen as indulged in the luxury of duels without having first\r\nobtained from their bishops a special license authorizing it.[468]\r\nAbout the same period, Geoffrey, Abbot of Vendôme, in a letter to the\r\nBishop of Saintes, complains of one of his monks who had fought in a\r\njudicial duel with a clerk of Saintes.[469] The practice continued,\r\nand though forbidden by Pope Innocent II. in 1140,[470] Alexander III.\r\nand Clement III. found it necessary to repeat the prohibition before\r\nthe close of the century.[471] Yet Alexander, when appealed to with\r\nrespect to a priest of the Campagna who had lost a finger in a duel,\r\ndecided that neither the offence nor the mutilation debarred him from\r\nthe exercise of his sacerdotal functions, and only directed him to\r\nundergo due penance.[472] The progress of the age, however, was shown\r\nwhen, about thirty years afterwards, Celestin III. pronounced sentence\r\nof deposition in a similar case submitted to him;[473] and this was\r\nformally and peremptorily confirmed by Innocent III. at the great\r\ncouncil of Lateran in 1215.[474]\r\n\r\nThat the peaceful ministers of Christ should vindicate their rights\r\nwith the sword, either personally or by proxy, was a sacrilege\r\nabhorrent to pious minds. As early as the middle of the ninth century,\r\nNicholas I., who did so much to establish the supremacy of the church,\r\nendeavored to emancipate it from this necessity, and declared that\r\nthe duel was not recognized by ecclesiastical law.[475] The utmost\r\nprivilege which the secular law accorded the clergy, however, was the\r\nright of presenting a champion in the lists, which zealous churchmen\r\nnaturally resented as an arbitrary injustice.[476] How thoroughly it\r\nwas carried out in practice, notwithstanding all remonstrances, is\r\nshown by a charter granted in 1024 by St. Stephen of Hungary to the\r\nmonastery of St. Adrian of Zala, by which, among other privileges, the\r\npious king bound himself to supply a champion in all suits against\r\nthe abbey, in order that the holy meditations of the monks might not\r\nbe interrupted.[477] Not long after, in 1033, the celebrated abbey\r\nof St. Clement at Pescara was involved in a dispute concerning some\r\nlands which had been cut off from its possessions by a change in the\r\ncourse of the river Pescara, and had been seized by the lords of the\r\ncontiguous territory. At an assembly of the magnates of the district\r\nit was adjudged that the matter must be settled by the duel. The\r\nnight before the combat was to take place the holy abbot Guido, after\r\nenjoining earnest prayers by all the monks, sallied forth alone to\r\nthe banks of the stream and stretching forth his staff adjured the\r\nwaters to repair the evil which they had wrought under the impulsion\r\nof the devil. The river forthwith returned to its old channel, and\r\nnext morning the multitude which assembled to witness the combat were\r\nastounded to see the miracle. The godless men who had seized on the\r\npossessions of the church humbly sought pardon for their sin, and the\r\nabbey remained in quiet enjoyment of its rights.[478]\r\n\r\nThe scandal of maintaining the claims of the church by carnal weapons\r\nand bloodshed was not soon suppressed. In 1112 we find a certain\r\nGuillaume Maumarel, in a dispute with the chapter of Paris concerning\r\nsome feudal rights over the domain of Sucy, appearing in the court\r\nof the Bishop of Paris for the purpose of settling the question by\r\nthe duel, and though the matter was finally compromised without\r\ncombat, there does not seem to have been anything irregular in his\r\nproceeding.[479] So, about the same period, in a case between the\r\nabbey of St. Aubin in Anjou and a neighboring knight, involving some\r\nrights of property, the monks not only challenged their adversary, but\r\nthe duel was held in the seignorial court of another monastery;[480]\r\nand in 1164, we find a duel decreed at Monza, by the Archbishop of\r\nCologne as chancellor of Italy, between an abbey and a layman of the\r\nvicinity.[481] That such cases, indeed, were by no means uncommon\r\nis shown by their special prohibition in 1195 by Celestin III.[482]\r\nYet, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of the Holy See, it was\r\nalmost impossible for the church to exempt itself from the universal\r\nliability. Though in 1174 Louis VII. granted a special privilege of\r\nexemption to the church of Jusiers and its men, on the ground that\r\nhe was bound to abrogate all improper customs,[483] still no general\r\nreform appears to have been practicable. An important step was gained\r\nwhen in 1176 Henry II., as a concession to the papacy, agreed that\r\necclesiastics should not be forced to the duel,[484] but this did not\r\nextend to the Scottish Marches, where by law an ecclesiastic was as\r\nliable as a layman to personal appearance in the lists; if he presented\r\na champion he was held in custody till the event of the duel, when,\r\nif the champion was defeated, his principal was promptly beheaded.\r\nInnocent III. sternly prohibited this in 1216, but ineffectually, as\r\nis seen by a complaint of the English clergy, in 1237, in which they\r\nmention the case of the Prior of Lide, who had thus recently suffered\r\nthe penalty. This was equally fruitless, for the _Leges Marchiarum_,\r\nenacted in 1249, declare that exemption from battle is confined to the\r\npersons of the kings and of the Bishops of St. Andrews and Durham.[485]\r\n\r\nIn France, during the thirteenth century, the liability continued. In\r\n1239 a knight of Orleans, Gui de Santillac, testified before the royal\r\ncouncil that the chapter of Saint-Aignan had appealed him in wager of\r\nbattle.[486] As late as the year 1245, some vassals of the chapter of\r\nNôtre Dame at Paris denied the service due by them, and demanded that\r\nthe claim of the chapter should be made good by the wager of battle.\r\nThat they had a legal right to do so is shown by the fact that the\r\nchurchmen were obliged to implore the intervention of the pope; and\r\nInnocent IV. accordingly granted to the chapter a special privilege,\r\nin which, on the ground that single combats were forbidden by the\r\ncanons, he declared that the church of Nôtre Dame should be entitled\r\nto prove its rights by witnesses, deeds, and other legitimate proofs,\r\nnotwithstanding the custom existing to the contrary.[487] It was\r\nprobably his interference in this case that led him a few years later,\r\nin 1252, to issue a decretal in which he pointed out the manifest\r\nhardship of forcing the clergy in France, when prosecuting such claims\r\nagainst their serfs, to have recourse to the duel, and thus, under the\r\ncanon law, to forfeit their positions. To remedy this he proclaimed\r\nas a general rule that all verdicts should be void when obtained\r\nagainst clerks either by means of the duel or through reason of their\r\nrefusing the combat;[488] yet in the following year he was obliged to\r\nintervene to protect the Archbishop of Sens, who complained that in\r\nthese cases he was obliged to make good his claims by battle.[489] In\r\nthis, Innocent was consistent, for one of the accusations which he had\r\nbrought against the Emperor Frederic II. when the latter was deposed\r\nat the Council of Lyons in 1245 was that he had forced ecclesiastics to\r\nundergo the duel, to the confusion of all distinctions between clerk\r\nand layman.[490] Even in Italy about 1220 the podestà of Florence\r\nordered the duel to decide a suit concerning certain property between\r\nsome citizens and the church of the Apostles; the latter invoked\r\nthe intervention of Honorius III., who commanded the matter to be\r\nsettled by regular judicial process, boldly alleging that the duel was\r\nunheard of in such matters,[491] but in spite of this and the repeated\r\nprohibitions of the popes, trial by combat was still towards the\r\nclose of the thirteenth century regarded as the only mode of settling\r\ndisputed questions between churches when the genuineness of a charter\r\nwas impugned.[492] Yet at the same period the doctors of canon law held\r\nthat an ecclesiastic appearing in the lists, either personally or by a\r\nchampion, was subject to deposition; it was better, they said, to lose\r\nlands and fiefs than to incur mortal sin. Unfortunately this was scarce\r\nmore than a mere _brutum fulmen_, for a dispensation could always be\r\nhad from bishop or pope.[493] Custom was stubborn, moreover, and half\r\na century later, when the judicial duel was going out of fashion,\r\na bishop of Liége so vexed the burghers of Louvain, by repeated\r\ncitations to the combat to settle disputed questions, that John III.\r\nDuke of Brabant was obliged to appeal to the Emperor Charles IV.,\r\nwho accordingly wrote to the bishops of Trèves, Cambrai, and Verdun\r\ndesiring them to find some means of putting an end to the bellicose\r\ntendencies of their episcopal brother.[494]\r\n\r\nThese sporadic cases only show how difficult it was throughout the\r\nwhole extent of Christendom to eradicate a custom so deeply rooted in\r\nancestral modes of thought. By the middle of the thirteenth century the\r\nchurch had succeeded in virtually establishing the claim, for which it\r\nhad long striven, that ecclesiastics were not subject to secular law\r\nin either civil or criminal matters. This exemption of course released\r\nthem from liability to the duel and placed them exclusively under\r\nspiritual jurisdiction, in which the strongly marked papal aversion to\r\nthe duel had full opportunity of making itself effective.[495]\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the relations between the church and the duel is to\r\nbe seen in the extensive secular jurisdiction of its prelates in their\r\ncapacity as temporal seigneurs. In this they were accustomed to award\r\nthe duel as freely as any other form of legal procedure. To do this\r\nwas not only one of the privileges which marked the feudal superior,\r\nbut was also a source of revenue from the fees and penalties thence\r\naccruing, and these rights were as eagerly sought and as jealously\r\nguarded by the spiritual lords as by the warlike barons. It would\r\nscarce be necessary to multiply instances, but I may mention a charter\r\ngranted by Fulk Nera, Count of Anjou, about the year 1010, bestowing\r\nthese rights on the abbey of Beaulieu in Touraine,[496] and one by\r\nthe Emperor Henry III., in 1052, to the bishop and church of Volterra\r\nin Italy.[497] The first authentic evidence of the existence of the\r\nbattle trial in Scotland is a charter of Alexander I. in 1124 to the\r\nAbbey of Scone, in which he bestows on the abbot and monks the right\r\nto grant the duel and ordeal in their jurisdiction; and his brother,\r\nSt. David I., conferred the same rights on the Abbey of Holyrood.[498]\r\nSome conscientious churchmen objected to a practice so antagonistic\r\nto all the teachings of the religion of which they were professors,\r\nand lifted up their voices to check the abuse. Thus, about the close\r\nof the eleventh century, we find the celebrated canonist, St. Ivo\r\nof Chartres, rebuking the Bishop of Orleans for ordering the combat\r\nto decide an important suit in his court.[499] Ivo even carried out\r\nhis principles to the sacrifice of the jurisdiction usually so dear\r\nto the prelates of his day, for in another case he refused to give\r\njudgment because it necessarily involved a trial by battle, and he\r\neluded the responsibility by transferring the cause to the court of\r\nthe Countess of Chartres.[500] A century later Peter Cantor declared\r\nthat as a priest he would in no case furnish relics on which the\r\npreliminary oaths were to be taken, for churchmen were prohibited from\r\nbeing concerned in bloodshed.[501] These precepts and examples were\r\nequally unavailing. Churchmen continued to award the wager of battle,\r\nand resolutely resisted any invasion of their privileges. In 1150\r\nthe statutes of the chapter of Lausanne direct that all duels shall\r\nbe fought before the provost—and the provost was Arducius, Bishop of\r\nGeneva.[502] In 1201 we see the Abbot of St. Alban’s and the Abbot of\r\nWestminster pleading as to their rights over the manor of Aldenham,\r\nincluding that of the duel.[503] Even in the thirteenth century, in\r\nthe archbishop’s court or officiality of Reims, the duel was a matter\r\nof course;[504] and a case is recorded, occurring in 1224, in a\r\ndispute about the ownership of a house, which was decided by a duel\r\nin the court of the abbey of St. Remy, where the abbot presided over\r\nthe lists and they were guarded by the royal officials.[505] In 1239\r\nthe Bishop of Orleans contested with the king as to the right of the\r\nformer to the jurisdiction of the duel in his diocese;[506] and in a\r\njudgment rendered in 1269, concerning a combat waged within the limits\r\nof the chapter of Nôtre Dame of Paris, we find that the first blows\r\nof the fight, usually known as _ictus regis_ or _les cous lou roi_,\r\nare alluded to as _ictus capituli_.[507] How eagerly these rights were\r\nmaintained is apparent from numerous decisions concerning contested\r\ncases. Thus, an agreement of 1193, between the Countess of St. Quentin\r\nand the chapter of Nôtre Dame, respecting the disputed jurisdiction of\r\nthe town of Viry, gives the official of the chapter the right to decree\r\nduels, but places the lists under the supervision of both parties,\r\nand divides the spoils equally between each.[508] A charter of 1199,\r\nconcerning the village of Marne, shows that the sergeant, or officer of\r\nthe chapter, had the cognizance of causes up to the gaging of battle,\r\nafter which further proceedings were reserved for the court of the\r\nbishop himself.[509] In 1219 the commune of Novara arrogated to itself\r\nthe right of decreeing the duel, but the bishop resisted this invasion\r\nof his privileges, and on the matter being referred for arbitration\r\nto the Bishop of Turin he decided in favor of his episcopal brother.\r\nThe Bishop of Modena had a long and expensive suit with his city on\r\nthe same question, which ended in 1227 with a compromise by which he\r\nabandoned the right; the Bishops of Vercelli were more fortunate, for\r\nthey maintained it until the beginning of the fourteenth century, when\r\njudicial duels were going out of fashion.[510] In 1257, while St. Louis\r\nwas exerting himself with so much energy to restrict the custom, an\r\nabbey is found engaged in a suit with the crown to prove its rights to\r\ndecree the duel, and to enjoy the fees and mulcts thence arising;[511]\r\nand in 1277 a similar suit on the part of the abbey of St. Vaast\r\nd’Arras was decided in its favor.[512] From a verdict given in 1293,\r\nthe right of the chapter of Soissons to decree the judicial combat\r\nappears to be undoubted, as well as the earnestness of the worthy\r\necclesiastics to exercise the privilege.[513] Even more significant\r\nis a declaration of the authorities of Metz, as late as 1299, by\r\nwhich the granting of all wagers of battle is expressly admitted by\r\nthe civil magistrates of the city to appertain to the court of the\r\narchbishop;[514] and even in 1311 a bishop of St. Brieuc ordered a\r\nduel between two squires pleading in his court, in consequence of high\r\nwords between them. From some cause the combat did not take place, and\r\nthe Christian prelate seized the arms and horses of the parties as\r\nhis mulct. They appealed to the Parlement of Paris, which ordered the\r\nrestoration of the confiscated articles, and fined the bishop for his\r\ndisregard of the royal edicts prohibiting the single combat.[515] Not\r\nlong before, Beaumanoir had definitely asserted that the church could\r\nnot be concerned in cases which involved the judicial duel, or the\r\ninfliction of death or mutilation;[516] but the church was not disposed\r\nto admit this limitation on its jurisdiction, and in spite of the\r\nattempted suppression of the wager of battle by the crown it continued\r\nin its multifarious capacity of seigneur to execute the cruel laws of\r\nthe period with undiminished activity.[517]\r\n\r\nIn other lands, where the duel had not experienced as in France the\r\nhostility of the supreme power, prelates continued to decree it,\r\nregardless of the papal anathemas. It was to no purpose that canon\r\nlawyers proved that they thereby incurred mortal sin, and that if\r\ndeath ensued they became “irregular” and incompetent to perform divine\r\nservice. To all this they turned a deaf ear, and John of Freiburg,\r\ntowards the close of the thirteenth century, is reduced to wishing that\r\npreachers would expound these principles in the pulpit and make them\r\nunderstood by the people at large.[518]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was one jurisdiction which held itself more carefully aloof from\r\nthe prevailing influence of barbarism—that of the Admiralty Courts,\r\nwhich covered a large portion of practical mercantile law. This is a\r\nfact easily explicable, not only from the character of the parties and\r\nof the transactions for which those courts were erected, but from the\r\ndirect descent of the maritime codes from the Roman law, less modified\r\nby transmission than any other portions of mediæval jurisprudence.\r\nThese codes, though compiled at a period when the wager of battle\r\nflourished in full luxuriance, have no reference to it whatever, and\r\nthe Assises de Jerusalem expressly allude to the Admiralty Courts\r\nas not admitting the judicial duel in proof,[519] while an English\r\ndocument of 12 Edward III. attests the same principle.[520] When,\r\nhowever, the case was one implying an accusation of theft or deception,\r\nas in denying the receipt of cargo, the matter entered into the\r\nprovince of criminal law, and the battle trial might be legitimately\r\nordered.[521]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forms and ceremonies employed in the judicial duel may furnish an\r\ninteresting subject of investigation for the admirers of chivalry, but\r\nthey teach in their details little concerning the habits and modes\r\nof thought of the Middle Ages, and for the most part are therefore\r\ninteresting only to the pure archæologist. Although minute directions\r\nhave come down to us in the manuals compiled for the guidance of judges\r\nof the lists, to enumerate them in their varying fashions would hardly\r\nbe worth the necessary space. Yet there are some details which are of\r\ninterest as illustrating both the theory and practice of the duel in\r\nits legal aspect. Thus the general principle on which the combat was\r\nconducted was the absolute assertion by each party of the justice of\r\nhis cause, confirmed by a solemn oath on the Gospels, or on a relic\r\nof approved sanctity, before the conflict commenced.[522] Defeat was\r\nthus not merely the loss of the suit, but was also a conviction of\r\nperjury, to be punished as such; and in criminal cases it was also a\r\nconviction of malicious prosecution on the part of a worsted appellant.\r\nThat it was regarded as much more serious than the simple loss of a\r\nsuit is shown by the provisions of the custom of Normandy, whereby a\r\nvanquished combatant was classed with perjurers, false witnesses, and\r\nother infamous persons, as incapable thenceforth of giving evidence\r\nin courts, or of serving on a jury.[523] Accordingly, we find the\r\nvanquished party, whether plaintiff or defendant, subjected to\r\npenalties more or less severe, varying with time and place.\r\n\r\nThis was a primeval custom, even in civil cases. In the ancient laws\r\nof the Alamanni, when there was controversy as to the ownership of\r\nland, the contestants brought to the court of the district some earth\r\nand branches of trees from the disputed property. These were wrapped\r\nand sealed and placed in the lists, where the combatants touched the\r\nbundle with their swords and called upon God to grant victory to the\r\nright; the land passed to the victor and the defeated party was fined\r\ntwelve sous for having made an unjust claim.[524] The tendency, as\r\ncivilization advanced, was to render the penalty more severe. Thus, in\r\n819, Louis le Débonnaire decreed that, in cases where testimony was\r\nevenly balanced, one of the witnesses from each side should be chosen\r\nto fight it out, the defeated champion suffering the usual penalty of\r\nperjury—the loss of a hand; while the remaining witnesses on the losing\r\nside were allowed the privilege of redeeming their forfeited members at\r\nthe regular legal rate.[525] William the Conqueror imposed a fine of\r\nforty sous on the losing side impartially;[526] this was increased to\r\nsixty sous by the compilation known as the laws of Henry I.;[527] and\r\nthe same regulation is stated by Glanville, with the addition that the\r\ndefeated person was forever disqualified as a witness or champion;[528]\r\nbut in practice the amount seems to have been indefinite, for in the\r\nPipe Rolls the fines levied for _recreantise_ vary from one mark to\r\na hundred.[529] In a case occurring in 1221 where the defendant was\r\nvictorious the record simply states that the appellant was ordered\r\ninto custody;[530] while in the time of Edward II. the loser, except\r\nin cases of felony, paid to the victor forty sous besides a small\r\ngratification under the name of _ruaille_, in addition to the loss of\r\nthe suit.[531] By the Lombard customs, early in the eleventh century,\r\nthe appellant, if vanquished, had the privilege of redeeming his hand;\r\nthe defendant, if defeated, lost his hand, and was of course subject\r\nin addition to the penalties of the crime of which he was proved\r\nguilty.[532] About the same time the Béarnese legislation is more\r\nmerciful, a fine of sixty-six sous Morlaas being imposed impartially\r\non the losing party.[533] In process of time this system was abandoned\r\nin some countries. The English law of the thirteenth century admitted\r\nthe justice of the _lex talionis_ in principle, but did not put it\r\nin practice, a vanquished appellant in capital cases being merely\r\nimprisoned as a calumniator, while the defendant, if defeated, was\r\nexecuted and his property confiscated.[534] The same distinction is to\r\nbe found in the contemporary custom of Normandy.[535] So, by the code\r\nin force in Verona in 1228, the Podestà in criminal cases had the power\r\nof ordering the duel, and of punishing at his pleasure the accuser if\r\nvanquished—the accused when convicted of course undergoing the penalty\r\nof his crime.[536] Towards the end of the thirteenth century, however,\r\nthere were some sceptics in Italy who argued that conviction by the\r\nduel ought not to entail the same punishment as conviction by witnesses\r\n“quia pugna est incertum Dei judicium.” This struck directly at the\r\nroot of the whole system, and Roffredo insists that the legal penalty\r\nis to be enforced.[537]\r\n\r\nMediæval legislation was not usually lenient to a worsted appellant.\r\nThe application of the _lex talionis_ to the man who brought a false\r\ncharge, thus adjudging to him the penalty which was incurred by the\r\ndefendant if convicted, was widely current during the Middle Ages. This\r\nprinciple is to be found enunciated in the broadest and most decided\r\nmanner in the ecclesiastical law,[538] and it was naturally brought\r\ninto play in regulating the fate of those engaged in the wager of\r\nbattle. Thus Guillaume le Breton states that when Philip Augustus,\r\nin 1203, wrested Normandy from the feeble grasp of John Lackland, one\r\nof the few changes which he ventured to introduce in the local laws\r\nof the duchy was to substitute this rule of confiscation, mutilation,\r\nor death, according to the degree of criminality involved in the\r\naccusation, for the comparatively light pecuniary mulct and loss of\r\nlegal status previously incurred by a worsted appellant.[539] The same\r\nsystem is followed throughout the legislation of St. Louis, whether\r\nthe punishment be light or capital, of an equal responsibility on both\r\nparties.[540] In capital cases, when champions were employed, the\r\nprincipals were held in prison with the cord around them with which the\r\ndefeated party was to be hanged; and if one were a woman, for the cord\r\nwas substituted the spade wherewith she was to be buried alive.[541]\r\nThe same principle of equal responsibility prevailed throughout the\r\nFrankish kingdoms of the East, where, in an appeal of murder, as we\r\nhave seen, the appellant fought by means of one of his witnesses, and\r\nthe defendant personally. In civil cases, in the Bourgeois Court,\r\nthe party defeated, including the plaintiff, if his side was the\r\nloser, was forever debarred from giving testimony, and had no future\r\nstanding in court; while in serious criminal cases, in both upper and\r\nlower courts, either side, when defeated, was hanged with the utmost\r\nimpartiality;[542] and it finally established itself in England,\r\nwhere in the fourteenth century we find it positively declared as an\r\nimperative regulation by Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, in an elaborate\r\ntreatise on the rules of single combat printed by Spelman.[543]\r\n\r\nIn Germany the custom was not uniform. In the Sachsenspiegel, and\r\nin one text of the Schwabenspiegel, the principle is laid down that\r\na defeated appellant escaped with a fine to the judge and to his\r\nadversary, while the defendant, if vanquished, was visited with the\r\npunishment due to his crime, or even with a heavier penalty;[544] while\r\nthe Saxon burgher law and another text of the Suabian code direct\r\nthat whichever party be defeated should lose a hand, or be executed,\r\naccording to the gravity of the crime alleged.[545] An exceptional\r\ncase, moreover, was provided for, in which both antagonists might\r\nsuffer the penalty; thus, when a convicted thief accused a receiver\r\nof stolen goods of having suggested the crime, the latter was bound\r\nto defend himself by the duel, and if defeated, both combatants were\r\nhanged without further ceremony.[546] That these penalties were not\r\nmerely nominal is shown by a case which occurred at Frankfort in 1369,\r\nwhen the divine interference was requisite, not to determine the\r\nvictor, but to evade the enforcement of the law. Two knights, Zierkin\r\nvon Vola and Adolf Hanche, who had married two sisters, quarrelled over\r\nthe inheritance of a deceased brother-in-law, and agreed to settle\r\ntheir difference by the duel. When the appointed day came, October 12,\r\nthey entered the lists on their chargers, prepared to do battle to the\r\ndeath, while their pious wives were earnestly praying God to soften\r\ntheir hearts and incline them to peace. These prayers were heard. With\r\na mutual impulse the two warriors leaped from their horses, throwing\r\nthemselves into each other’s arms and exclaiming, “Brother, I confess\r\nmyself vanquished.” The chief magistrate of the city, who presided\r\nover the combat, was not disposed to deprive the spectators of their\r\npromised entertainment, and indignantly declared that the law of the\r\nduel did not permit both antagonists to depart unhurt, for the one\r\nwho yielded must be put to death; and he confirmed this sentence by\r\na solemn oath that one or the other should die before he would taste\r\nfood. Then an affecting contest arose between the late antagonists,\r\neach one proclaiming himself the vanquished and demanding the penalty\r\non his own head, when suddenly divine vengeance visited the bloody and\r\nremorseless judge, who fell dead, thus fulfilling his impious vow that\r\nhe would not eat until he had a victim.[547]\r\n\r\nIt was probably as an impressive symbol of the penalties affixed by\r\nlaw to defeat in these combats that in some places the suggestive\r\ncustom was in force of placing in the lists two biers in readiness for\r\ntheir ghastly occupants. In a duel which occurred at Augsburg in 1409,\r\nbetween two men named Marschalck and Hachsenacker, the former threw his\r\nadversary on the ground, and then asked him what he would have done\r\nhad he been the victor. Hachsenacker grimly replied that he would have\r\nslain his foe, whereupon Marschalck despatched him, and placing himself\r\nin his bier caused himself to be carried to the church of St. Ulric,\r\nwhere he returned thanks for his victory.[548]\r\n\r\nThe most hideous exaggeration of the system, however, was found in\r\nthe Frankish kingdoms of the East, which reserved a special atrocity\r\nfor women—one of the numerous instances to be observed in mediæval\r\nlaw of the injustice applied habitually to the weaker sex. When a\r\nwoman appeared, either as appellant or defendant, in the lists by her\r\nchampion, if he was defeated she was promptly burnt, no matter what was\r\nthe crime for which the duel occurred—and as many accusations could\r\nonly be determined by the wager of battle, she had no choice but to\r\nundergo the chance of the most dreadful of deaths.[549]\r\n\r\nIt was not customary to order the combat to take place immediately,\r\nbut to allow a certain interval for the parties to put their affairs\r\nin order and to undergo the necessary training. In Southern Germany\r\nthis delay was for nobles from four to six weeks, and for others a\r\nfortnight, and during this period any assault by one on the other\r\nwas a capital offence.[550] They were required to give security\r\nfor their due appearance at the appointed time, various fines and\r\npunishments being inflicted on defaulters. By the law of both Northern\r\nand Southern Germany, when default was made by the defendant he was\r\nheld guilty of the crime charged upon him: and if he was allowed the\r\nprivilege of redeeming hand or life either as defendant or appellant,\r\nhe was declared infamous, and deprived of the protection of the law.\r\nAccording to some MSS., indeed, all the possessions of a defaulter\r\nwere forfeited, either to his heirs or to his feudal superior.[551]\r\nIn a case occurring in the twelfth century in Hainault, between a\r\nseigneur and a man whom he claimed as a serf, the latter demanded the\r\nduel, which was allowed, but on the appointed day he failed to appear\r\nby nine o’clock. His adversary had waited for him since daybreak, and\r\nclaimed the verdict which was awarded him by the council of Hainault.\r\nAt this moment the missing man presented himself, but was adjudged to\r\nbe too late, and was delivered to his claimant as a serf. According\r\nto the custom of Flanders, indeed, the combatant who failed to appear\r\nsuffered banishment, with confiscation of all his possessions.[552]\r\nThis extreme rigor, however, did not obtain universally. Among the\r\nBéarnese, for instance, the forfeiture for a default was only sixteen\r\nsous Morlaas.[553] By the English law, the defaulter was declared\r\ninfamous, and was also liable to a fine to the king, for which there\r\nwas apparently no fixed amount.[554] The Scandinavians punished him\r\npopularly by erecting a “nithstong”—_pertica execrationis_—a post\r\ninscribed with defamatory runes, and so flagrant was this insult\r\nconsidered, that finally it was prohibited by law under pain of\r\nexile.[555] Perhaps the most emphatic assertion, however, of the\r\nobligation to appear is the rule in the law of the Scottish Marches\r\nin 1249, that if the accused should die before the appointed day his\r\nbody must be brought to the lists, “for no man can essoin himself by\r\ndeath.”[556]\r\n\r\nThe bail, of course, was liable for all legal penalties incurred by\r\na defaulter, and occasionally, indeed, was made to share the fate\r\nof his principal, when the latter appeared and was defeated. In the\r\nlaw of Southern Germany, according to one text, the bail under these\r\ncircumstances was liable to the loss of a hand, which, however, he\r\ncould redeem, while another version makes him suffer the penalty\r\nincurred by his principal.[557] This latter rule is announced in a\r\nmiracle play of the fourteenth century, where a stranger knight at the\r\ncourt of Paris, compelled to fight in defence of the honor of the\r\nking’s daughter, is unable to find security. The queen and princess\r\noffer themselves as hostages and are accepted, but the king warns them—\r\n\r\n    Dame, par Dieu le roy celestre!\r\n    Bien vous recevray pour hostage;\r\n    Mais de tant vous fas-je bien sage,\r\n    Se le dessus en peut avoir\r\n    Ardré, je vous feray ardoir.\r\n      Et mettre en cendre.[558]\r\n\r\nPoverty on the part of one of the combatants, rendering him unable to\r\nequip himself properly for the combat, was not allowed to interfere\r\nwith the course of justice. In such cases, under the law of Northern\r\nGermany, the judge was required to provide him with the requisite\r\nweapons.[559] In England, where the royal jurisdiction embraced all\r\ncriminal cases, the king furnished the weapons and paid all expenses,\r\nand when the combatant was an “approver,” or criminal who had turned\r\nstate’s evidence, he was supported until his duty was accomplished\r\nof fighting all whom he accused as accomplices. Thus in the accounts\r\nof the sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1190, there is an entry of 15_s._\r\n10_d._ for the approver Adam Godechap from Pask until Michaelmas at one\r\npenny per diem; also 6_s._ for his armor in three duels, and 38_s._\r\n6_d._ for carts to convey prisoners, sureties, and probators from\r\nLincoln to London and elsewhere.[560] The crown likewise paid the\r\nexpenses of administering the other ordeals: in 1166 a single entry in\r\nthe Exchequer accounts shows payment for thirty-four ordeals and five\r\nbattles.[561]\r\n\r\nAs regards the choice of weapons, much curious anecdote could be\r\ngathered from the pages of Brantôme and others learned in punctilio,\r\nwithout throwing additional light upon mediæval customs. It may be\r\nbriefly observed, however, that when champions were employed on both\r\nsides, the law appears generally to have restricted them to the\r\nclub and buckler, and to have prescribed perfect equality between\r\nthe combatants.[562] An ordonnance of Philip Augustus, in 1215,\r\ndirects that the club shall not exceed three feet in length.[563]\r\nIn England the club or battoon was rendered more efficient with a\r\n“crook,” usually of horn, but sometimes of iron, giving to the weapon\r\nthe truly formidable aspect of a pickaxe or tomahawk.[564] When the\r\nprincipals appeared personally, it would seem that in early times\r\nthe appellant had the choice of weapons, which not only gave him an\r\nenormous advantage, but enabled him to indulge any whims which his\r\ntaste or fancy might suggest, as in the case of a Gascon knight in\r\nthe thirteenth century, who stipulated that each combatant should be\r\ncrowned with a wreath of roses. As every detail of equipment was thus\r\nsubject to the caprice of the challenger, those who were wealthy\r\nsometimes forced their poorer adversaries to lavish immense sums on\r\nhorses and armor.[565] When, however, the spirit of legislation became\r\nhostile to the wager of battle, this advantage was taken from the\r\nappellant. Frederic II. appears to have been the first to promulgate\r\nthis rational idea, and, in decreeing that in future the choice of\r\narms shall rest with the defendant, he stigmatizes the previous custom\r\nas utterly iniquitous and unreasonable.[566] In this, as in so many\r\nother matters, he was in advance of his age, and the general rule was\r\nthat neither antagonist should have any advantage over the other,\r\nexcept the fearful inequality, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade, when a roturier dared to challenge a gentleman.[567] In the law\r\nof Northern Germany care was taken that the advantage of the sun was\r\nequally divided between the combatants; they fought on foot, with bare\r\nheads and feet, clad in tunics with sleeves reaching only to the elbow,\r\nsimple gloves, and no defensive armor except a wooden target covered\r\nwith hide, and bearing only an iron boss; each carried a drawn sword,\r\nbut either might have as many more as he pleased in his belt.[568]\r\nEven when nobles were concerned, who fought on horseback, it was the\r\nrule that they should have no defensive armor save a leather-covered\r\nwooden shield and a glove to cover the thumb; the weapons allowed\r\nwere lance, sword, and dagger, and they fought bare-headed and clad\r\nin linen tunics.[569] According to Upton, in the fifteenth century,\r\nthe judges were bound to see that the arms were equal, but he admits\r\nthat on many points there were no settled or definite rules.[570] In\r\nWales, an extraordinary custom violated all the principles of equality.\r\nUnder the Welsh law, twins were considered as one person, and as they\r\nwere entitled to but one share in the patrimony of the family, so\r\nthey were allowed to come into the field of combat as one man.[571]\r\nIn Russia, each combatant followed his own pleasure; and a traveller\r\nin the sixteenth century relates that the Muscovites were in the\r\nhabit of embarrassing themselves with defensive armor to an extent\r\nwhich rendered them almost helpless, so that in combats with Poles,\r\nLithuanians, and Germans they were habitually worsted, until judicial\r\nduels between natives and foreigners were at length prohibited on this\r\naccount.[572]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the combat ended at sunset or when the stars became\r\nvisible, and in such case if it was a drawn battle the case was decided\r\nin favor of the defendant, because the prosecutor had not proved his\r\ncharge. Yet a charter of 961 recites that two gentlemen, Bernard and\r\nGerbert, appeared before Count Raymond, each claiming the church of\r\nSt. Médard and its appurtenances, which had been bequeathed by the\r\nlate owner Ricaud, for the repose of his soul, to the Abbey of St.\r\nPeter of Beaulieu. The count granted them the trial by battle. At two\r\no’clock their champions entered the lists and fought without result\r\nuntil sunset. Then the count declared the battle ended and adjudged the\r\nchurch to the abbey; the contestants acquiesced and signed the charter\r\nconfirming its rights.[573] In Italy, however, the duel was fought\r\nto an end; if stopped by darkness the judge was instructed to note\r\ncarefully the respective positions of the combatants and replace them\r\nexactly the next morning, so that neither might derive advantage from\r\nthe adjournment.[574]\r\n\r\nThe issue at stake being death or dishonor, with severe penalties\r\nhanging over the vanquished, whether principal or champion, no\r\nchivalric courtesy was to be expected in these combats. They were\r\nfought to the bitter end with persistent and brutal ferocity,\r\nresembling the desperate encounters of wild beasts. A fairly\r\nillustrative example is furnished in an incident which followed the\r\nassassination of Charles the Good of Flanders in 1127. One of the\r\naccomplices, a knight named Guy, was challenged for complicity by\r\nanother named Herman. Both were renowned warriors, but Herman was\r\nspeedily unhorsed by his adversary, who with his lance frustrated all\r\nhis attempts to remount. Then Herman disabled the horse of his opponent\r\nand the combat was renewed on foot with swords. Equally skilful in\r\nfence they continued the struggle till fatigue compelled them to drop\r\nsword and shield and they wrestled for the mastery. Guy threw his\r\nantagonist, fell on him and beat him in the face with his gauntlets\r\ntill he seemed to be motionless, but Herman quietly slipped his hand\r\nbelow the other’s coat of mail, grasped his testicles and with a mighty\r\neffort wrenched them away. Guy fell over and expired; he we adjudged\r\nguilty and his body, after exposure in the pillory, was hung on the\r\ntop of a mast along with that of the leader of the conspiracy who had\r\nbeen executed the same day, the two corpses being made to embrace each\r\nother, as though conferring about the plot.[575] Ghastly details such\r\nas these serve to emphasize the difference between the judicial combat\r\nand the modern duel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllusions have occurred above to the employment of champions, a\r\npeculiarity of these combats which received an application sufficiently\r\nextended to deserve some special notice.[576] It has been seen that\r\nthose unable to wield the sword or club were not therefore exempted\r\nfrom the duel, and even the scantiest measure of justice would require\r\nthat they should have the right to delegate their vindication to\r\nsome more competent vehicle of the Divine decision. This would seem\r\noriginally to have been the office of some member of the family,\r\nas in the cognate procedure of sacramental purgation. Among the\r\nAlamanni, for instance, a woman when accused could be defended by a\r\nkinsman _cum tracta spata_;[577] the same rule is prescribed by the\r\nLombard law,[578] and by that of the Angli and Werini;[579] while\r\nthe universal principle of family unity renders the presumption fair\r\nthat it prevailed throughout the other races in whose codes it is\r\nnot specifically indicated. Restricted to cases of disability, the\r\nuse of champions was a necessity to the battle ordeal; but at a very\r\nearly period the practice received a remarkable extension, which was\r\ndirectly in conflict with the original principles of the judicial duel,\r\nin permitting able-bodied antagonists to put forward substitutes,\r\nwhether connected with them or not by ties of blood, who fought\r\nthe battle for their principals. With regard to this there appears\r\nto have been a considerable diversity of practice among the races\r\nof primitive barbarians. The earliest Frisian laws not only grant\r\nunlimited permission for their employment, but even allow them to be\r\nhired for money.[580] The laws of the Franks, of the Alamanni, and of\r\nthe Saxons make no allusion to such a privilege, and apparently expect\r\nthe principal to defend his rights himself, and yet an instance occurs\r\nin 590, where, in a duel fought by order of Gontran, the defendant was\r\nallowed to intrust his cause to his nephew, though, as he was accused\r\nof killing a stag in the king’s forest, physical infirmity could\r\nhardly have been pleaded.[581] From some expressions made use of by\r\nSt. Agobard, in his onslaught on the ordeal of battle, we may fairly\r\npresume that, under Louis le Débonnaire, the employment of champions,\r\nin the Burgundian law, was, if not forbidden, at least unusual as\r\nrespects the defendant, even in cases where age or debility unfitted\r\nhim for the combat, while it was allowed as a matter of course to the\r\nappellant.[582] On the other hand, the Baioarian law, which favored\r\nthe duel more than any of the other cognate codes, alludes to the\r\nemployment of champions in every reference to it, and with the Lombards\r\nthe judicial combat and the champion seem to have been likewise\r\nconvertible terms even with regard to defendants.[583] In a charter of\r\nthe latter half of the tenth century in France, recording a judicial\r\nduel to decide a contest concerning property, the judge, in ordering\r\nthe combat, calls upon the antagonists to produce skilled champions to\r\ndefend their claims at the time and place indicated, which would show\r\nthat the principals were not expected to appear personally.[584] Under\r\nthe North German law it rested with the appellant to demand the duel\r\neither with or without champions. If the defendant were crippled, and\r\nwas on that account obliged to appear by a hired champion, then the\r\nappellant could put forward another to meet him. A defendant, moreover,\r\nwho had suffered a previous conviction for theft or rapine was always\r\nobliged to appear personally. When the duel was decreed by the court,\r\nand not demanded by the appellant, then the accused could decline it\r\nif he could prove that the prosecutor had hired a champion.[585] The\r\npractical spirit of the Italians led to the universal substitution of\r\nchampions for the principals; they were selected by the magistrates\r\nand were paid by the state when the parties were too poor to bear the\r\nexpense.[586]\r\n\r\nIn all these provisions for the putting forward of substitutes in the\r\nduel there is something so repugnant to the fierce and self-relying\r\nspirit in which the wager of battle found its origin, and the use of a\r\nprofessional gladiator is so inconsistent with the pious reference to\r\nthe judgment of God, which was the ostensible excuse for the duel, that\r\nsome external reason is required to account for its introduction. This\r\nreason is doubtless to be found in the liberty allowed of challenging\r\nwitnesses, to which allusion has already been made (p. 121). The\r\nprevalence of this throughout Western Europe readily enabled parties,\r\nunwilling themselves to encounter the risks of a mortal struggle, to\r\nput forward some truculent bravo who swore unscrupulously, and whose\r\nevidence would require him to be forced out of court at the sword’s\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThis becomes very evident as early as we have detailed regulations of\r\nprocedure in the books of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In\r\nEngland, for instance, until the first statute of Westminster, issued\r\nby Edward I., in 1275, the hired champion of the defendant, in a\r\nsuit concerning real estate, was obliged to assume the position of a\r\nwitness, by swearing that he had been personally present and had seen\r\nseizin given of the land, or that his father when dying had enjoined\r\nhim by his filial duty to maintain the defendant’s title as though he\r\nhad been present.[587] This legal fiction was common also to the Norman\r\njurisprudence of the period, where in such cases the champion of the\r\nplaintiff was obliged to swear that he had heard and seen the matters\r\nalleged in support of the claim, while the opposing champion swore that\r\nthey were false.[588] In a similar spirit, an earlier code of Normandy\r\nprescribes that champions shall be taken to see the lands and buildings\r\nin dispute, before receiving the oath of battle, in the same manner as\r\na jury of view.[589] We have seen that in the Assises d’Antioche it was\r\nrequisite for a prosecutor or a plaintiff to have a witness who was\r\nready to offer battle, in default of which the unsupported oath of the\r\nother party was sufficient to secure a verdict.[590] It necessarily\r\nfollows that this witness must in most cases have been a hired\r\nchampion, and this connection between the two functions is further\r\nshown in the regulation of the Assises de Jerusalem and of the Sicilian\r\nconstitutions, which directed that the champion should swear on the\r\nfield of battle as to his belief in the justice of the quarrel which\r\nhe was about to defend,[591] a practice which is also found in the\r\nScottish law of the thirteenth century.[592] An English legal treatise\r\nof the period, indeed, assumes that the principals can put forward\r\nonly witnesses as substitutes, and gives as a reason why combats in\r\ncivil suits were always conducted by champions, that in such cases the\r\nprincipals could not act as witnesses for themselves.[593] In a similar\r\nspirit, if on the field of battle one of the parties presented a\r\nchampion who was not receivable as a witness and had not been accepted\r\nby the court, the case could be decided against him by default.[594]\r\n\r\nLooking on the profession of a champion in this light, as that of a\r\nwitness swearing for hire, we can find a justification for the heavy\r\npenalties to which he was subjected in case of defeat—penalties of\r\nwhich the real purport presumably was to insure his fidelity to his\r\nprincipal. Thus, in the Norman coutumier above referred to, in civil\r\nsuits as to disputed landed possessions, the champion swearing to\r\nthe truth of his principal’s claim was, if defeated, visited with a\r\nheavy fine and was declared infamous, being thenceforth incapable of\r\nappearing in court either as plaintiff or as witness, while the penalty\r\nof the principal was merely the loss of the property in dispute;[595]\r\nand a similar principle was recognized in the English law of the\r\nperiod.[596] In criminal cases, from a very early period, while the\r\nprincipal perhaps escaped with fine or imprisonment, the hired ruffian\r\nwas hanged, or at best lost a hand or foot, the immemorial punishment\r\nfor perjury;[597] while the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem prescribe\r\nthat in combats between champions, the defeated one shall be promptly\r\nhanged, whether dead or alive.[598] The Assises d’Antioche are somewhat\r\nmore reasonable, for they provide merely that the vanquished champion\r\nand his principal shall suffer the same penalty, whether simply a\r\nforfeiture of civil rights in civil cases, or hanging as in accusations\r\nof homicide or other serious crime.[599] That, in the later periods,\r\nat least, the object of this severity was to prevent the champion from\r\nbetraying his employer’s cause was freely admitted. Beaumanoir thus\r\ndefends it on the ground of the liability of champions to be bought\r\nover by the adverse party, which rendered the gentle stimulus of\r\nprospective mutilation necessary to prevent them from being purchased\r\nby the adversary;[600] and it is probably owing to this that the full\r\nseverity of the punishment is shown to be still in existence by a\r\ncharter of so late a date as 1372, when the use of the judicial duel\r\nhad fully entered on its decline.[601] In the same spirit, the Emperor\r\nFrederic II. prohibited champions from bargaining with each other not\r\nto use teeth and hands. He commanded them to inflict all the injury\r\npossible on their adversaries, and decreed that they should, in case of\r\ndefeat, share the punishment incurred by the principal, if the judge of\r\nthe combat should consider that through cowardice or treachery they had\r\nnot conducted the duel with proper energy and perseverance.[602]\r\n\r\nWith such risks to be encountered, it is no wonder that the trade of\r\nthe champion offered few attractions to honest men, who could keep\r\nbody and soul together in any other way. In primitive times, the\r\nsolidarity of the family no doubt caused the champion in most cases to\r\nbe drawn from among the kindred; at a later period he might generally\r\nbe procured from among the freedmen or clients of the principal,\r\nand an expression in the Lombard law justifies the assumption that\r\nthis was habitual, among that race at least.[603] In the palmy days\r\nof chivalry, it was perhaps not uncommon for the generous knight to\r\nthrow himself bodily into the lists in defence of persecuted and\r\nfriendless innocence, as he was bound to do by the tenor of his oath of\r\nknighthood.[604] Even as late as the fifteenth century, indeed, in a\r\ncollection of Welsh laws, among the modes by which a stranger acquired\r\nthe rights of kindred is enumerated the act of voluntarily undergoing\r\nthe duel in the place of a principal unable or unwilling to appear for\r\nhimself.[605] A vast proportion of pleaders, however, would necessarily\r\nbe destitute of these chances to avoid the personal appearance in\r\nthe arena for which they might be unfitted or disinclined, and thus\r\nthere arose the regular profession of the paid gladiator. Reckless\r\ndesperadoes, skilled at quarter-staff, or those whose familiarity with\r\nsword and dagger, gained by a life spent in ceaseless brawls, gave them\r\nconfidence in their own ability, might undertake it as an occupation\r\nwhich exposed them to little risk beyond what they habitually incurred,\r\nand of such was the profession generally composed. This evil must\r\nhave made itself apparent early, for we find Charlemagne endeavoring\r\nto oppose it by decreeing that no robber should be allowed to appear\r\nin the lists as a champion, and the order needed to be frequently\r\nrepeated.[606]\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman law commenced to exercise its powerful influence\r\nin moulding the feudal customs into a regular body of procedure,\r\nand admiring jurists lost no opportunity of making use of the\r\nnewly-discovered treasures of legal lore, whether applicable or not,\r\nit is easy to understand that the contempt and the civil disabilities\r\nlavished by the Imperial jurisprudence on the gladiator of antiquity\r\ncame to be transferred to the mediæval champion; although the latter,\r\nby the theory of the law, stood forth to defend the innocent, while\r\nthe former ignobly exposed his life for the gratification of an\r\nimbruted populace. This legacy of shame is clearly traceable in Pierre\r\nde Fontaines. To be a gladiator or an actor was, by the Roman law, a\r\ncompetent cause for disinheritance.[607] One of the texts prescribing\r\nit is translated bodily by de Fontaines, the _arenarius_ of the\r\nRoman becoming the _champions_ of the Frenchman;[608] and in another\r\nsimilar transcription from the Digest, the _athleta_ of the original\r\nis transformed into a “champion.”[609] By the thirteenth century,\r\nthe occupation of champion had thus become infamous. Its professors\r\nwere classed with the vilest criminals, and with the unhappy females\r\nwho exposed their charms for sale, as the champion did his skill and\r\ncourage.[610] They were held incapable of appearing as witnesses, and\r\nthe extraordinary anomaly was exhibited of seeking to learn the truth\r\nin affairs of the highest moment by a solemn appeal to God, through the\r\ninstrumentality of those who were already considered as convicts of\r\nthe worst kind, or who, by the very act, were branded with infamy if\r\nsuccessful in justifying innocence, and if defeated were mutilated or\r\nhanged.[611] By the codes in force throughout Germany in the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries, they were not only, in common with bastards,\r\nactors, and jugglers, deprived of all legal privileges, such as\r\nsucceeding to property, bearing witness, etc., but even their children\r\nwere visited with the same disabilities.[612] The utter contempt in\r\nwhich they were held was moreover quaintly symbolized in the same codes\r\nby the provisions of a tariff of damages to be assessed for blows and\r\nother personal injuries. A graduated list of fines is given for such\r\ninsults offered to nobles, merchants, peasants, etc., in compensation\r\nof their wounded honor; below the serf come the mountebank and juggler,\r\nwho could only cuff the assailant’s shadow projected on the wall;\r\nand last of all are rated the champion and his children, whose only\r\nredress was a glance of sunshine cast upon them by the offender from a\r\nduelling shield. Deemed by law incapable of receiving an insult, the\r\nsatisfaction awarded was as illusory as the honor to be repaired.[613]\r\nThat this poetical justice was long in vogue is proved by the\r\ncommentary upon it in the Richstich Landrecht, of which the date is\r\nshown to be not earlier than the close of the fourteenth century, by an\r\nallusion in the same chapter to accidental deaths arising from the use\r\nof firearms.[614]\r\n\r\nThe Italians, however, took a more sensible and practical view of the\r\nmatter. Accepting as a necessity the existence of champions as a class,\r\nthey were disposed rather to elevate than to degrade the profession.\r\nThe law required that they should not be criminals or infamous, and\r\nthe fact that they fought for hire did not render them so.[615] In\r\nthe Veronese code of 1228, they appear as an established institution,\r\nconsisting of individuals selected and appointed by the magistrates,\r\nwho did not allow them to receive more than one hundred sous for the\r\nperformance of their office.[616]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the evils attendant upon the employment of champions\r\nwere generally recognized, and it is not singular that efforts were\r\noccasionally made to abrogate or limit the practice. Otho II., whose\r\nlaws did so much to give respectability to the duel, decreed that\r\nchampions should be permitted only to counts, ecclesiastics, women,\r\nboys, old men, and cripples.[617] That this rule was strictly enforced\r\nin some places we may infer from the pleadings of a case occurring\r\nin 1010 before the Bishop of Arezzo, concerning a disputed property,\r\nwherein a crippled right hand is alleged as the reason for allowing\r\na champion to one of the parties.[618] In other parts of Italy,\r\nhowever, the regulation must have been speedily disregarded, for about\r\nthe same period Henry II. found it necessary to promulgate a law\r\nforbidding the employment of substitutes to able-bodied defendants\r\nin cases of parricide or of aggravated murder;[619] and when, two\r\nhundred years later, Frederic II. almost abolished the judicial combat\r\nin his Neapolitan dominions, we may fairly presume from one of his\r\nremarks that champions were universally employed.[620] Indeed, he\r\nmade provision for supplying them at the public expense to widows,\r\norphans, and paupers who might be unable to secure for themselves such\r\nassistance.[621] In Germany, early in the eleventh century, it would\r\nseem that champions were a matter of course, from the expressions made\r\nuse of in describing the execution of a number of robbers convicted\r\nin this manner at Merseburg in 1017.[622] At a later period, it\r\nseems probable, from a comparison of two chapters of the Suabian\r\nlaws, that efforts were made to prevent the hiring of professional\r\ngladiators,[623] and in the Saxon burgher laws a man could refuse the\r\nduel if he could prove that his antagonist was a champion serving for\r\npay.[624] That these efforts to restrict the practice, however, were\r\nattended with little success may be inferred from the disabilities\r\nwhich were so copiously showered on the class by the same laws.\r\n\r\nIn England, where, as we have seen, the identity of champions and\r\nwitnesses was clearly asserted, there were prolonged efforts to\r\nsuppress their hiring. In 1150, Henry II. strictly prohibited the\r\nwager of battle with hired champions in his Norman territories;[625]\r\nalthough the Norman custom not only admitted them but required the\r\nprincipal to pay the full sum agreed upon to his champion whether\r\ndefeated or not.[626] We learn from Glanville that a champion suspected\r\nof serving for money might be objected to by the opposite party,\r\nwhence arose a secondary combat to determine his fitness for the\r\nprimary one.[627] Bracton, moreover, develops this by asserting as\r\na rule that a witness suspected of being a hired champion was not\r\nallowed to proceed to the combat, but was tried for the attempt by a\r\njury, and if convicted suffered the penalty of perjury in the loss of\r\na hand or a foot,[628] and in another passage he states that hired\r\nchampions were not permitted.[629] How far these rules were enforced\r\nit would now be difficult to determine. Records show that a frequent\r\ndefence against an adverse witness was an offer to prove that he was\r\na hired champion.[630] On the other hand, the payment of champions\r\nwas frequent and no concealment seems to have been thought necessary\r\nconcerning it. Towards the close of the twelfth century, by a charter\r\nStephen de Nerbana grants two _virgata_ of land to William son of\r\nRalph “propter duellum quod fecit pro me.”[631] In another charter of\r\nBracton’s date John “quondam porcarius de Coldingham” grants to the\r\nPriory of Coldingham a tract of land which he had received from Adam\r\nde Riston in payment for victoriously fighting a duel for him.[632]\r\nEven more significant are the formal agreements with champions, such as\r\nthat by which in 1276 Bishop Swinefeld declares to all men that he has\r\nappointed Thomas of Brydges his champion, on a salary of 6s. 8d. per\r\nannum, so long as he shall be able to fight, with extra compensation\r\nin case he is called upon to perform his functions.[633] Eventually,\r\nas we have seen (p. 183), in civil cases, both parties were compelled\r\nby law to employ champions, which presupposes, as a matter of course,\r\nthat in a great majority of instances the substitutes must have been\r\nhired.[634] In criminal cases there seems to have been a compromise;\r\nin felonies, the defendant was obliged to appear personally, while in\r\naccusations of less moment he was at liberty to put forward a witness\r\nas champion;[635] and when the appellant, from sex or other disability,\r\nor the defendant from age, was unable to undergo the combat personally,\r\nit was forbidden, and the case was decided by a jury.[636] By the\r\nScottish law of the thirteenth century, it is evident that champions\r\nwere not allowed in any case, since those disabled by age or wounds\r\nwere forced to undergo the ordeal in order to escape the duel.[637]\r\nThis strictness became relaxed in time, though the practice of\r\nemploying champions seems never to have received much encouragement. By\r\na law of Alexander II., about the year 1250, it appears that a noble\r\nhad the privilege of putting forward a substitute; but if a peasant\r\nchallenged a noble, he was obliged to appear personally, unless his\r\nlord undertook the quarrel for him and presented the champion as from\r\nhimself.[638]\r\n\r\nThe tendency exhibited by the English law in distinguishing between\r\ncivil and criminal cases is also manifested elsewhere. Thus, in France\r\nand the Frankish kingdoms of the East, there were limitations placed\r\nby law on the employment of champions in prosecutions for crime,[639]\r\nwhile in civil actions there appear to have been, at least in France,\r\nno restrictions whatever.[640] This distinction between civil and\r\ncriminal practice is very clearly enunciated by Pierre de Fontaines,\r\nwho states that in appeal of judgment the appellant in criminal cases\r\nis bound to show satisfactory cause for employing a champion, while\r\nin civil affairs the right to do so requires no argument.[641] In\r\npractice, however, it is doubtful whether there was any effectual bar\r\nto their use in any case, for the Monk of St. Denis, in praising St.\r\nLouis for suppressing the battle-trial, gives as one of the benefits\r\nof its abrogation, the removal of the abuse by which a rich man could\r\nbuy all the champions of the vicinity, so that a poorer antagonist\r\nhad no resource to avoid the loss of life or heritage.[642] This\r\nhiring of champions, moreover, was legally recognized as a necessity\r\nattendant upon the privilege of employing them.[643] High rank, or a\r\nmarked difference between the station of parties to an action, was\r\nalso admitted as justifying the superior in putting forward a champion\r\nin his place.[644] Local variations, however, are observable in the\r\ncustoms regulating these matters. Thus the municipal laws of Reims, in\r\nthe fourteenth century, not only restrict the admission of champions\r\nin criminal matters to cases in which age or physical disability\r\nmay incapacitate the principals from personally taking part in the\r\ncombat, but also require the accused to swear that the impediment has\r\nsupervened since the date of the alleged offence; and even this was\r\nof no avail if the prosecutor had included in his appeal of battle an\r\nassertion that such disability had existed at the time specified.[645]\r\nWitnesses obliged to support their testimony by the duel were not only\r\nsubject to the same restrictions, but in substituting a hired gladiator\r\nwere obliged to swear that they had vainly sought among their friends\r\nfor some one to assume the office voluntarily.[646] The whole tenor of\r\nthese provisions, indeed, manifests a decided intention to surround the\r\nemployment of champions with every practicable impediment. In Béarn,\r\nagain, the appellant in cases of treason had a right to decide whether\r\nthe defendant should be allowed to put forward a substitute, and from\r\nthe expressions in the text it may be inferred that in the selection\r\nof champions there was an endeavor to secure equality of age, size,\r\nand strength.[647] This equalization of chances was thoroughly carried\r\nout in Italy, where the law required them to be selected with that\r\nview.[648] Thus in the Veronese code of 1228, where, as has been seen,\r\nthe champions were a recognized body, regulated and controlled by the\r\nstate, no one could engage a champion before a duel had been judicially\r\ndecreed. Then the magistrate was bound to choose gladiators of equal\r\nprowess, and the choice between them was given to the defendant; an\r\narrangement which rendered the mutilation inflicted on the vanquished\r\ncombatant only justifiable on the score of suspected treachery.[649]\r\nA Bolognese regulation of the thirteenth century was even fairer, and\r\nreduced the combat to an affair of chance in which the judgment of God\r\nhad the fullest scope, for when the champions were in the lists a child\r\nplaced inside of the garments of each a card bearing the name of his\r\nprincipal, and until the combat was ended no one knew which of them\r\nrepresented the plaintiff and which the defendant.[650] In Bigorre, the\r\nonly restriction seems to have been that champions should be natives\r\nand not foreigners, and their payment was recognized as a matter\r\nof course.[651] By the Spanish law of the thirteenth century, the\r\nemployment of champions was so restricted as to show an evident desire\r\non the part of the legislator to discourage it as far as possible. The\r\ndefendant had the right to send a substitute into the field, but the\r\nappellant could do so only by consent of his adversary. The champion\r\nwas required to be of birth equal to his principal, which rendered\r\nthe hiring of champions almost impossible, and not superior to him in\r\nforce and vigor. Women and minors appeared by their next of kin, and\r\necclesiastics by their advocates.[652] In Russia, until the sixteenth\r\ncentury, champions were never employed, contestants being always\r\nobliged to appear in person. In 1550, the code known as the Sudebtnick\r\nat length permitted the employment of champions in certain cases.[653]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were two classes of pleaders, however, with whom the hiring\r\nof champions was a necessity, and who could not be bound by the\r\nlimitations imposed on ordinary litigants. While the sexagenary, the\r\ninfant, and the crippled might possibly find a representative among\r\ntheir kindred, and while the woman might appear by her husband or next\r\nof kin, the ecclesiastical foundations and chartered towns had no\r\nsuch resource. Thus, in a suit for taxes, in 1164, before the court\r\nof Verona, Bonuszeno of Soavo proved that the village of Soavo had\r\nexempted his father Petrobatalla from all local imposts for having\r\nserved as champion in a duel between it and a neighboring community,\r\nand his claim to the reversion of the exemption was allowed.[654] So\r\na charter of 1104 relates how the monks of Noailles were harassed by\r\nthe seizure of some mills belonging to their abbey, claimed by an\r\nofficial of William Duke of Aquitaine, until at length the duke agreed\r\nto allow the matter to be decided by the duel, when the champion of\r\nthe church was victorious and the disputed property was confirmed to\r\nthe abbey.[655] At length the frequent necessity for this species of\r\nservice led to the employment of regularly appointed champions, who\r\nfought the battles of their principals for an annual stipend, or for\r\nsome other advantages bestowed in payment. Du Cange, for instance,\r\ngives the text of an agreement by which one Geoffry Blondel, in 1256,\r\nbound himself to the town of Beauvais as its champion for a yearly\r\nsalary of twenty sous Parisis, with extra gratifications of ten livres\r\nTournois every time that he appeared in arms to defend its cause, fifty\r\nlivres if blows were exchanged, and a hundred livres if the combat\r\nwere carried to a triumphant issue. It is a little singular that\r\nBeaumanoir, in digesting the customs of Beauvais but a few years later,\r\nspeaks of this practice as an ancient and obsolete one, of which he had\r\nonly heard through tradition.[656] That it continued to be in vogue\r\nuntil long after, is shown by Monteil, who alludes to several documents\r\nof the kind, bearing date as late as the fifteenth century.[657]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, ecclesiastical communities were likewise under the necessity\r\nof employing champions to defend their rights. Sometimes, as we have\r\nseen, these were hired, and were of no better character than those\r\nof common pleaders. They seem to have been well paid if we may judge\r\nfrom an agreement of 1258 between the Abbey of Glastonbury and Henry\r\nde Fernbureg, by which the latter bound himself to defend by battle\r\nthe rights of the abbey to certain manors against the Bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, for which he is to receive thirty sterling marks, of which\r\nten are to be paid when battle is gaged, five when he is shaved for\r\nthe combat, and on the day of the duel fifteen are to be placed in\r\nthe hands of a third party to be paid over to him if he strikes a\r\nsingle blow.[658] Sometimes, however, gentlemen did not disdain to\r\nserve God by fighting for the Church in special cases, as when, so\r\nlate as the middle of the fourteenth century, the priory of Tynemouth\r\nhad a suit with a troublesome neighbor, Gerard de Widdrington, over\r\nthe manor of Hawkshaw, and Sir Thomas Colville, who had won great\r\nrenown in the French wars, appeared in court as its champion and\r\noffered the combat. No one could be found hardy enough to accept his\r\nchallenge and the manor was adjudged to the priory.[659] There was,\r\nmoreover, another class of champions of the Church who occupied a\r\ndistinguished position, and were bound to defend the interests of\r\ntheir clients in the field as well as in the court and in the lists;\r\nthey also led the armed retainers of the church when summoned by the\r\nsuzerain to national war. The office was honorable and lucrative, and\r\nwas eagerly sought by gentlemen of station, who turned to account the\r\nopportunities of aggrandizement which it afforded; and many a noble\r\nfamily traced its prosperity to the increase of ancestral property\r\nthus obtained, directly or indirectly, by espousing the cause of fat\r\nabbeys and wealthy bishoprics, as when, in the ninth century, the Abbot\r\nof Figeac, near Cahors, bestowed on a neighboring lord sixty churches\r\nand five hundred mansi on condition of his fighting the battles of the\r\nabbey.[660] The influence of feudalism early made itself felt, and the\r\noffice of _Vidame_ or _Avoué_ became generally hereditary, after which\r\nits possessors, for the most part, rendered themselves independent of\r\ntheir benefactors, their exactions and spoliations becoming a favorite\r\ntheme of objurgation among churchmen, who regarded them as the worst\r\nenemies of the foundations which they had sworn to protect.[661] In\r\nmany instances the position was a consideration obtained for donations\r\nbestowed upon churches, so that in some countries, and particularly\r\nin England, the title of _advocatus_ became gradually recognized as\r\nsynonymous with patron. Thus, one of the worst abuses of the Anglican\r\nChurch is derived from this source, and the forgotten wrongs of the\r\nMiddle Ages are perpetuated, etymologically at least, in the advowson\r\nwhich renders the cure of souls too often a matter of bargain and sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many influences were at work in favor of the judicial duel, and\r\nit was so thoroughly engrafted in the convictions and prejudices of\r\nEurope, that centuries were requisite for its extirpation. Curiously\r\nenough, the earliest decisive action against it took place in\r\nIceland, where it was formally interdicted as a judicial proceeding\r\nin 1011;[662] and though the assumption that this was owing to the\r\nintroduction of Christianity has been disproved, still, the fact that\r\nboth events were contemporaneous allows us to conclude that some\r\ninfluence may have been exercised by even so imperfect a religion as\r\nthat taught to the new converts, though the immediate cause was a\r\n_holm-gang_ between two skalds of distinction, Gunnlaug Ormstunga and\r\nSkald-Rafn.[663] Norway was not long in following the example, for\r\nabout the same period the Jarls Erik and Sven Hakonsen abolished the\r\n_holm-gang_, while paganism was as yet widely prevalent.[664] Denmark\r\nwas almost equally prompt: indeed Saxo Grammaticus in one passage\r\nattributes to it the priority, asserting that when Poppo, in 965,\r\nconverted Harold Blaatand by the ordeal of red-hot iron, it produced so\r\npowerful an effect as to induce the substitution of that mode of trial\r\nfor the previously existing wager of battle.[665] Yet it evidently was\r\nnot abolished for a century later, for when Harold the Simple, son of\r\nSven Estrith, ascended the throne in 1074, among the legal innovations\r\nwhich he introduced was the substitution of the purgatorial oath for\r\nall other forms of defence, which, as Saxo specifically states, put an\r\nend to the wager of battle, and opened the door to great abuses.[666]\r\n\r\nFiercer tribes than these in Europe there were none, and their\r\nabrogation of the battle trial at this early age is an inexplicable\r\nanomaly. It was an exceptional movement, however, without results\r\nbeyond their own narrow boundaries. Other causes had to work slowly and\r\npainfully for ages before man could throw off the bonds of ancestral\r\nprejudice. One of the most powerful of these causes was the gradual\r\nrise of the Tiers-État to consideration and importance. The sturdy\r\nbourgeois, though ready enough with morion and pike to defend their\r\nprivileges, were usually addicted to a more peaceful mode of settling\r\nprivate quarrels. Devoted to the arts of peace, seeing their interest\r\nin the pursuits of industry and commerce, enjoying the advantage of\r\nsettled and permanent tribunals, and exposed to all the humanizing\r\nand civilizing influences of close association in communities, they\r\nspeedily acquired ideas of progress very different from those of the\r\nsavage feudal nobles living isolated in their fastnesses, or of the\r\nwretched serfs who crouched for protection around the castles of their\r\nmasters. Accordingly, the desire to escape from the necessity of\r\npurgation by battle is almost coeval with the founding of the first\r\ncommunes. The earliest instance of this tendency that I have met with\r\nis contained in the charter granted to Pisa by the Emperor Henry IV.\r\nin 1081, by which he agrees that any accusations which he may bring\r\nagainst citizens can be tried without battle by the oaths of twelve\r\ncompurgators, except when the penalties of death or mutilation are\r\ninvolved; and in questions concerning land, the duel is forbidden when\r\ncompetent testimony can be procured.[667] Limited as these concessions\r\nmay seem, they were an immense innovation on the prejudices of the\r\nage, and are important as affording the earliest indication of the\r\ndirection which the new civilization was assuming. More comprehensive\r\nwas the privilege granted soon afterwards by Henry I. to the citizens\r\nof London, by which he released them wholly from the duel, and this was\r\nfollowed by similar exemptions during the twelfth century bestowed on\r\none town after another; but it was not till near the end of the century\r\nthat in Scotland William the Lion granted the first charter of this\r\nkind to Inverness.[668] About the year 1105, the citizens of Amiens\r\nreceived a charter from their bishop, St. Godfrey, in which the duel is\r\nsubjected to some restriction—not enough in itself, perhaps, to effect\r\nmuch reform, yet clearly showing the tendency which existed. According\r\nto the terms of this charter no duel could be decreed concerning any\r\nagreement entered into before two or three magistrates if they could\r\nbear witness to its terms.[669] One of the earliest instances of\r\nabsolute freedom from the judicial combat occurs in a charter granted\r\nto the town of Ypres, in 1116 by Baldwin VII. of Flanders, when he\r\nsubstituted the oath with four conjurators in all cases where the\r\nduel or the ordeal was previously in use.[670] This was followed by a\r\nsimilar grant to the inhabitants of Bari by Roger, King of Naples,\r\nin 1132.[671] Curiously enough, almost contemporary with this is a\r\nsimilar exemption bestowed on the rude mountaineers of the Pyrenees.\r\nCentulla I. of Bigorre, who died in 1138, in the Privileges of Lourdes,\r\nauthorizes the inhabitants to prosecute their claims without the\r\nduel;[672] and his desire to discourage the custom is further shown by\r\na clause permitting the pleader who has gaged his battle to withdraw\r\non payment of a fine of only five sous to the seigneur, in addition to\r\nwhat the authorities of the town may levy.[673] Still more decided was\r\na provision of the laws of Soest in Westphalia, somewhat earlier than\r\nthis, by which the citizens were absolutely prohibited from appealing\r\neach other in battle;[674] and this is also to be found in a charter\r\ngranted to the town of Tournay by Philip Augustus in 1187, though in\r\nthe latter the cold water ordeal is prescribed for cases of murder and\r\nof wounding by night.[675] In the laws of Ghent, granted by Philip of\r\nAlsace in 1178, there is no allusion to any species of ordeal, and\r\nall proceedings seem to be based on the ordinary processes of law,\r\nwhile in the charter of Nieuport, bestowed by the same prince in 1163,\r\nalthough the ordeal of red-hot iron and compurgatorial oaths are freely\r\nalluded to as means of rebutting accusations, there is no reference\r\nwhatever to the battle trial, showing that it must then have been no\r\nlonger in use.[676] The charters granted to Medina de Pomar in 1219 by\r\nFernando III. of Castile, and to Treviño by Alfonso X. in 1254, provide\r\nthat there shall be no trial by single combat.[677] Louis VIII. in\r\nthe charter of Crespy, granted in 1223, promised that neither himself\r\nnor his officials should in future have the right to demand the wager\r\nof battle from its inhabitants;[678] and shortly after, the laws of\r\nArques, conceded by the abbey of St. Bertin in 1231, provided that the\r\nduel could only be decreed between two citizens of that commune when\r\nboth parties should assent to it.[679] In the same spirit the laws of\r\nRiom, granted by Alphonse de Poitiers, the son of St. Louis, in 1270,\r\ndeclared that no inhabitant of the town should be forced to submit\r\nto the wager of battle.[680] In the customs of Maubourguet, granted\r\nin 1309, by Bernard VI. of Armagnac, privileges similar to those of\r\nLourdes, alluded to above, were included, rendering the duel a purely\r\nvoluntary matter.[681] Even in Scotland, partial exemptions of the same\r\nkind in favor of towns are found as early as the twelfth century. A\r\nstranger could not force a burgher to fight, except on an accusation of\r\ntreachery or theft, while, if a burgher desired to compel a stranger\r\nto the duel, he was obliged to go beyond the confines of the town. A\r\nspecial privilege was granted to the royal burghs, for their citizens\r\ncould not be challenged by the burghers of nobles or prelates, while\r\nthey had the right to offer battle to the latter.[682] Much more\r\nefficient was the clause of the third _Keure_ of Bruges, granted in\r\n1304 by Philip son of Count Guy of Flanders, which strictly prohibited\r\nthe duel. Any one who gave or received a wager of battle was fined\r\nsixty sols, one-half for the benefit of the town, and the other for the\r\ncount.[683]\r\n\r\nThe special influence exercised by the practical spirit of trade in\r\nrendering the duel obsolete is well illustrated by the privilege\r\ngranted, in 1127, by William Clito, to the merchants of St. Omer,\r\ndeclaring that they should be free from all appeals to single combat in\r\nall the markets of Flanders.[684] In a similar spirit, when Frederic\r\nBarbarossa, in 1173, was desirous of attracting to the markets of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle and Duisbourg the traders of Flanders, in the code\r\nwhich he established for the protection of such as might come, he\r\nspecially enacted that they should enjoy immunity from the duel.[685]\r\nEven Russia found it advantageous to extend the same exemption to\r\nforeign merchants, and in the treaty which Mstislas Davidovich made in\r\n1228 with the Hanse-town of Riga, he granted to the Germans who might\r\nseek his dominions immunity from liability to the red-hot iron ordeal\r\nand wager of battle.[686]\r\n\r\nGermany seems to have been somewhat later than France or Italy in\r\nthe movement, yet her burghers evidently regarded it with favor.\r\nFrederic II., who recorded his disapproval of the duel in his Sicilian\r\nConstitutions, was ready to encourage them in this tendency, and in his\r\ncharters to Ratisbon and Vienna he authorized their citizens to decline\r\nthe duel and clear themselves by compurgation,[687] while as early as\r\n1219 he exempted the Nürnbergers from the appeal of battle throughout\r\nthe empire.[688] The burgher law of Northern Germany alludes to the\r\njudicial combat only in criminal charges, such as violence, homicide,\r\nhousebreaking, and theft;[689] and this is limited in the statutes of\r\nEisenach, of 1283, which provide that no duel shall be adjudged in the\r\ntown, except in cases of homicide, and then only when the hand of the\r\nmurdered man shall be produced in court at the trial.[690] In 1291,\r\nRodolph of Hapsburg issued a constitution declaring that the burghers\r\nof the free imperial cities should not be liable to the duel outside\r\nof the limits of their individual towns,[691] and in the Kayser-Recht\r\nthis privilege is extended by declaring the burghers exempt from all\r\nchallenge to combat, except in a suit brought by a fellow-citizen.[692]\r\nNotwithstanding this, special immunities continued to be granted,\r\nshowing that these general laws were of little effect unless supported\r\nby the temper of the people. Thus Louis IV. in 1332 gave such a\r\nprivilege to Dortmund, and so late as 1355 Charles IV. bestowed it on\r\nthe citizens of Worms.[693]\r\n\r\nA somewhat noteworthy exception to this tendency on the part of the\r\nmunicipalities is to be found in Moravia. There, under the laws of\r\nOttokar Premizlas, in 1229 the duel was forbidden between natives\r\nand only allowed when one of the parties was a foreigner. Yet his\r\nson Wenceslas, some years later, confirmed the customs of the town\r\nof Iglau, in which the duel was a recognized feature enforced by an\r\nascending scale of fines. If the accused compounded with the prosecutor\r\nbefore the duel was ordered he paid the judge one mark; after it was\r\nadjudged, two marks; after the lists were entered, three marks; after\r\nweapons were taken, four marks; and if he waited till the weapons were\r\ndrawn he had to pay five marks.[694]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these were local regulations which had no direct bearing on general\r\nlegislation, except in so far as they might assist in softening the\r\nmanners of their generation and aiding in the general spread of\r\ncivilization. A more efficient cause was to be found in the opposition\r\nof the Church. From Liutprand the Lombard to Frederic II., a period\r\nof five centuries, no secular lawgiver, south of Denmark, seems to\r\nhave thought of abolishing the judicial combat as a measure of general\r\npolicy, and those whose influence was largest were the most conspicuous\r\nin fostering it. During the whole of this period the Church was\r\nconsistently engaged in discrediting it, notwithstanding that the local\r\ninterests or pride of individual prelates might lead them to defend the\r\nvested privileges connected with it in their jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nWhen King Gundobald gave form and shape to the battle ordeal in\r\ndigesting the Burgundian laws, Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, remonstrated\r\nloudly against the practice as unjust and unchristian. A new\r\ncontroversy arose on the occasion of the duel between the Counts Bera\r\nand Sanila, to which allusion has already been made as one of the\r\nimportant events in the reign of Louis le Débonnaire. St. Agobard,\r\nArchbishop of Lyons, took advantage of the opportunity to address to\r\nthe Emperor a treatise in which he strongly deprecated the settlement\r\nof judicial questions by the sword; and he subsequently wrote another\r\ntract against ordeals in general, consisting principally of scriptural\r\ntexts with a running commentary, proving the incompatibility of\r\nChristian doctrines with these unchristian practices.[695] Some\r\nthirty-five years later the Council of Valence, in 855, denounced\r\nthe wager of battle in the most decided terms, praying the Emperor\r\nLothair to abolish it throughout his dominions, and adopting a canon\r\nwhich not only excommunicated the victor in such contests, but refused\r\nthe rights of Christian sepulture to the victim.[696] By this time\r\nthe forces of the church were becoming consolidated in the papacy,\r\nand the Vicegerent of God was beginning to make his voice heard\r\nauthoritatively throughout Europe. The popes accordingly were not long\r\nin protesting energetically against the custom. Nicholas I. denounced\r\nit vigorously as a tempting of God, unauthorized by divine law,[697]\r\nand his successors consistently endeavored, as we have already seen, to\r\ndiscredit it. In the latter half of the twelfth century, Peter Cantor\r\nargues that a champion undertaking the combat relies either on his\r\nsuperior strength and skill, which is manifest injustice; or on the\r\njustice of his cause, which is presumption; or on a special miracle,\r\nwhich is a devilish tempting of God.[698] Alexander III. decided\r\nthat a cleric engaging in a duel, whether willingly or unwillingly,\r\nwhether victor or vanquished, was subject to deposition, but that his\r\nbishop could grant him a dispensation provided there had been loss of\r\nneither life nor limb.[699] Towards the close of the century Celestine\r\nIII. went further, and in the case of a priest who had put forward a\r\nchampion who had slain his antagonist he decided that both principal\r\nand champion were guilty of homicide and the priest could no longer\r\nperform his functions, though he might have a dispensation to hold his\r\nbenefice.[700] These cases suggest one of the reasons why the repeated\r\npapal prohibitions were so ineffective. The all-pervading venality of\r\nthe Church of the period found in the dispensing power an exhaustless\r\nsource of profit, and dispensations for “irregularities” of all kinds\r\nwere so habitually issued that the threatened punishments lost their\r\nterrors, and as Rome gradually absorbed the episcopal jurisdiction,\r\noffenders of all kinds knew that relief from the operation of the\r\ncanons could always be had there. Some reason for setting them aside\r\nwas never hard to find. In 1208 a canon of Bourges was elected prior;\r\nhis disappointed competitor claimed that he was ineligible because\r\nhe had once served as judge in a duel in which there was effusion of\r\nblood. Innocent III. was appealed to, who decided that the canon was\r\ncapable of promotion to any dignity, and the chief reason alleged was\r\nthat the evil custom of the duel was so universal in some regions\r\nthat ecclesiastics of all classes from the lowest to the highest were\r\nhabitually concerned in them.[701]\r\n\r\nInnocent III., however, took care that the great council of Lateran in\r\n1215 should confirm all the previous prohibitions of the practice.[702]\r\nIt was probably this papal influence that led Simon de Montfort, the\r\nspecial champion of the church, to limit the use of the duel in the\r\nterritories which he won in his crusade against the Count of Toulouse.\r\nIn a charter given December 1, 1212, he forbids its use in all the\r\nseignorial courts in his dominions, except in cases of treason, theft,\r\nrobbery, and murder.[703] De Montfort’s dependence on Rome, however,\r\nwas exceptional, and Christendom at large was not as yet prepared to\r\nappreciate the reformatory efforts of the popes. The most that the\r\nCouncil of Paris, held in 1212 for the reformation of the church by the\r\ncardinal-legate Robert de Curzon, could do was to order the bishops\r\nnot to permit the duel in cemeteries or other sacred places.[704]\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the church as represented by its worthiest and most\r\nauthoritative spokesmen continued. St. Ramon de Peñafort, the leading\r\ncanonist of his time, about 1240, asserts uncompromisingly that all\r\nconcerned in judicial combats are guilty of mortal sin; the sin is\r\nsomewhat lightened indeed when the pleader is obliged to accept the\r\ncombat by order of the judge, but the judge himself, the assessors\r\nwho counsel it, and the priest who gives the benediction all sin most\r\ngravely; if death occurs they are all homicides and are rendered\r\n“irregular.”[705] About the same time Alexander Hales ingeniously\r\nargued away the precedent of David and Goliath by showing that it\r\nwas simply a prefiguration of the Passion, in which Christ triumphed\r\nover Satan as in a duel.[706] With the development, moreover, of the\r\nsubtilties of scholastic theology the doctors found that the duel was\r\nless objectionable than the other forms of ordeal, because, as Thomas\r\nAquinas remarks, the hot iron or boiling water is a direct tempting\r\nof God, while the duel is only a matter of chance, for no one expects\r\nmiraculous interposition unless the champions are very unequal in age\r\nor strength.[707] This struck at the very root of the faith on which\r\nconfidence in the battle ordeal was based, yet in spite of it the\r\npersistence of ecclesiastical belief in the divine interposition is\r\nfairly illustrated by a case, related with great triumph by monkish\r\nchroniclers, as late as the fourteenth century, when a duel was\r\nundertaken by direction of the Virgin Mary herself. In 1325, according\r\nto the story, a French Jew feigned conversion to Christianity in\r\norder to gratify his spleen by mutilating the images in the churches,\r\nand at length he committed the sacrilege of carrying off the holy\r\nwafer to aid in the hideous rites of his fellows. The patience of\r\nthe Virgin being at last exhausted, she appeared in a vision to a\r\ncertain smith, commanding him to summon the impious Israelite to the\r\nfield. A second and a third time was the vision repeated without\r\neffect, till at last the smith, on entering a church, was confronted\r\nby the Virgin in person, scolded for his remissness, promised an\r\neasy victory, and forbidden to pass the church door until his duty\r\nshould be accomplished. He obeyed and sought the authorities. The\r\nduel was decreed, and the unhappy Hebrew, on being brought into the\r\nlists, yielded without a blow, falling on his knees, confessing his\r\nunpardonable sins, and crying that he could not resist the thousands of\r\narmed men who appeared around his adversary with threatening weapons.\r\nHe was accordingly promptly burned, to the great satisfaction of all\r\nbelievers.[708]\r\n\r\nEvidently the clergy at large did not second the reformatory efforts of\r\ntheir pontiffs. There was not only the ancestral belief implanted in\r\nthe minds of those from among whom they were drawn, but the seignorial\r\nrights enjoyed by prelates and abbeys were not to be willingly\r\nabandoned. The progress of enlightenment was slow and the teachings\r\nof the papacy can only be enumerated as one of the factors at work to\r\ndiscredit the judicial duel.[709] We can estimate how deeply rooted\r\nwere the prejudices to be overcome when we find Dante seriously\r\narguing that property acquired by the duel is justly acquired; that\r\nGod may be relied upon to render the just cause triumphant; that it is\r\nwicked to doubt it, while it is folly to believe that a champion can be\r\nthe weaker when God strengthens him.[710]\r\n\r\nIn its endeavors to suppress the judicial duel the Church had to weigh\r\nopposing difficulties. It could, as we have seen (p. 156), enjoin its\r\nmembers from taking part in such combats and from adjudging them in\r\ntheir jurisdictions; it could decree that priests became “irregular” if\r\ndeath ensued in duels where they gave the benediction, or perhaps even\r\nwhere they had only brought relics on which the combatants took the\r\noaths. But over the secular courts it had only the power of persuasion,\r\nor at most of moral coercion, and among the canon doctors there was\r\nconsiderable discussion as to the extent to which it could pronounce\r\nparticipation in the duel a mortal sin, entailing excommunication and\r\ndenial of the rites of sepulture. When a man sought the duel, when he\r\ndemanded it of the judge and provoked his adversary to it, he could be\r\npronounced guilty of homicide if death ensued. It was otherwise where\r\nan innocent man was accused of a mortal crime and would be hanged if\r\nhe refused the duel adjudged to him by court. It was argued that the\r\nChurch was a harsh mother if she forced her children thus to submit\r\nto death and infamy for a scruple of recent origin, raised merely by\r\npapal command, though the more rigid casuists insisted even on this.\r\nAll agreed, however, that in civil cases a man ought rather to undergo\r\nthe loss of his property than to imperil his soul and disobey the\r\nChurch.[711]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most powerful cause at work was the revival of the Roman\r\njurisprudence, which in the thirteenth century commenced to undermine\r\nall the institutions of feudalism. Its theory of royal supremacy was\r\nmost agreeable to sovereigns whose authority over powerful vassals\r\nwas scarcely more than nominal; its perfection of equity between\r\nman and man could not fail to render it enticing to clear-minded\r\njurists, wearied with the complicated and fantastic privileges of\r\necclesiastical, feudal, and customary law. Thus recommended, its\r\nprogress was rapid. Monarchs lost no opportunity of inculcating respect\r\nfor that which served their purpose so well, and the civil lawyers,\r\nwho were their most useful instruments, speedily rose to be a power in\r\nthe state. Of course the struggle was long, for feudalism had arisen\r\nfrom the necessities of the age, and a system on which were based all\r\nthe existing institutions of Europe could only be attacked in detail,\r\nand could only be destroyed when the advance of civilization and the\r\ngeneral diffusion of enlightenment had finally rendered it obsolete.\r\nThe French Revolution was the final battle-field, and that terrible\r\nupheaval was requisite to obliterate a form of society whose existence\r\nhad numbered nine hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe wager of battle was not long in experiencing the first assaults\r\nof the new power. The earliest efficient steps towards its abolition\r\nwere taken in 1231 by the Emperor Frederic II. in his Neapolitan code.\r\nHe pronounces it to be in no sense a legal proof, but only a species\r\nof divination, incompatible with every notion of equity and justice;\r\nand he prohibits it for the future, except in cases of poisoning or\r\nsecret murder and treason where other proof is unattainable; and even\r\nin these it is placed at the option of the accuser alone; moreover,\r\nif the accuser commences by offering proof and fails he cannot then\r\nhave recourse to combat; the accused must be acquitted.[712] The\r\nGerman Imperial code, known as the Kayser-Recht, which was probably\r\ncompiled about the same time, contains a similar denunciation of the\r\nuncertainty of the duel, but does not venture on a prohibition,\r\nmerely renouncing all responsibility for it, while recognizing it as a\r\nsettled custom.[713] In the portion, however, devoted to municipal law,\r\nwhich is probably somewhat later in date, the prohibition is much more\r\nstringently expressed, manifesting the influences at work;[714] but\r\neven this is contradicted by a passage almost immediately preceding it.\r\nHow little influence these wise counsels had, in a state so intensely\r\nfeudal and aristocratic, is exemplified in the Suabian and Saxon codes,\r\nwhere the duel plays so important a part. Yet the desire to escape it\r\nwas not altogether confined to the honest burghers of the cities, for\r\nin 1277 Rodolph of Hapsburg, even before he granted immunity to the\r\nimperial towns, gave a charter to the duchy of Styria, securing to the\r\nStyrians their privileges and rights, and in this he forbade the duel\r\nin all cases where sufficient testimony could be otherwise obtained;\r\nwhile the general tenor of the document shows that this was regarded as\r\na favor.[715] The Emperor Albert I. was no less desirous of restricting\r\nthe duel, and in ordinary criminal cases endeavored to substitute\r\ncompurgation.[716]\r\n\r\nStill, as late as 1487, the Inquisitor Sprenger, in discountenancing\r\nthe red-hot iron ordeal in witch-trials, feels himself obliged to\r\nmeet the arguments of those who urged the lawfulness of the duel as\r\na reason for permitting the cognate appeal to the ordeal. To this he\r\nnaïvely replies, as Thomas Aquinas had done, that they are essentially\r\ndifferent, as the champions in a duel are about equally matched, and\r\nthe killing of one of them is a simple affair, while the iron ordeal,\r\nor that of drinking boiling water, is a tempting of God by requiring a\r\nmiracle.[717] This shows at the same time how thoroughly the judicial\r\ncombat had degenerated from its original theory, and that the appeal\r\nto the God of battles had become a mere question of chance, or of the\r\ncomparative strength and skill of a couple of professional bravos.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the influence of Roman institutions, transmitted through\r\nthe Wisigothic laws, had allowed to the judicial duel less foothold\r\nthan in other mediæval lands, and the process of suppressing it began\r\nearly. In Aragon the chivalrous Jayme I., _el Conquistador_, in the\r\nfranchises granted to Majorca, on its conquest in 1230, prohibited\r\nthe judicial combat in both civil and criminal cases.[718] Within\r\nforty years from this, Alfonso the Wise of Castile issued the code\r\ngenerally known as Las Siete Partidas. In this he evidently desired\r\nto curb the practice as far as possible, stigmatizing it as a custom\r\npeculiar to the military class (_por lid de caballeros ò de peones_),\r\nand as reprehensible both as a tempting of God and as a source of\r\nperpetual injustice.[719] Accordingly, he subjected it to very\r\nimportant limitations. The wager of battle could only be granted by\r\nthe king himself; it could only take place between gentlemen, and in\r\npersonal actions alone which savored of treachery, such as murder,\r\nblows, or other dishonor, inflicted without warning or by surprise.\r\nOffences committed against property, burning, forcible seizure, and\r\nother wrongs, even without defiance, were specifically declared not\r\nsubject to its decision, the body of the plaintiff being its only\r\nrecognized justification.[720] Even in this limited sphere, the consent\r\nof both parties was requisite, for the appellant could prosecute in\r\nthe ordinary legal manner, and the defendant, if challenged to battle,\r\ncould elect to have the case tried by witnesses or inquest, nor could\r\nthe king himself refuse him the right to do so.[721] When to this\r\nis added that a preliminary trial was requisite to decide whether\r\nthe alleged offence was treacherous in its character or not, it will\r\nbe seen that the combat was hedged around with such difficulties\r\nas rendered its presence on the statute book scarcely more than an\r\nunmeaning concession to popular prejudice; and if anything were wanting\r\nto prove the utter contempt of the legislator for the decisions of the\r\nbattle-trial, it is to be found in the regulation that if the accused\r\nwas killed on the field, without confessing the imputed crime, he was\r\nto be pronounced innocent, as one who had fallen in vindicating the\r\ntruth.[722] The same desire to restrict the duel within the narrowest\r\npossible limits is shown in the rules concerning the employment of\r\nchampions, which have been already alluded to. Although the Partidas\r\nas a scheme of legislation was not confirmed until the cortes of 1348\r\nthese provisions were lasting and produced the effect designed. It is\r\ntrue that in 1342 we hear of a combat ordered by Alfonso XI. between\r\nPay Rodriguez de Ambia and Ruy Paez de Biedma, who mutually accused\r\neach other of treason. It was fought before the king and lasted for\r\nthree days without either party obtaining the victory, till, on the\r\nevening of the third day, the king entered the lists and pacified\r\nthe quarrel, saying that both antagonists could serve him better by\r\nfighting the Moors, with whom he was at war, than by killing each\r\nother.[723] Not long afterwards Alfonso in the Ordenamiento de Alcalá,\r\nissued in 1348, repeated the restrictions of the Partidas, but in a\r\nvery cursory manner, and rather incidently than directly, showing\r\nthat the judicial combat was then a matter of little importance.[724]\r\nIn fact, the jurisprudence of Spain was derived so directly from the\r\nRoman law through the Wisigothic code and its Romance recension, the\r\nFuero Juzgo, that the wager of battle could never have become so\r\ndeeply rooted in the national faith as among the more purely barbarian\r\nraces. It was therefore more readily eradicated, and yet, as late as\r\nthe sixteenth century, a case occurred in which the judicial duel was\r\nprescribed by Charles V., in whose presence the combat took place.[725]\r\n\r\nThe varying phases of the struggle between progress and centralization\r\non the one side, and chivalry and feudalism on the other, were\r\nexceedingly well marked in France, and as the materials for tracing\r\nthem are abundant, a more detailed account of the gradual reform may\r\nperhaps have interest, as illustrating the long and painful strife\r\nwhich has been necessary to evoke order and civilization out of the\r\nincongruous elements from which modern European society has sprung.\r\nThe sagacity of St. Louis, so rarely at fault in the details of civil\r\nadministration, saw in the duel not only an unchristian and unrighteous\r\npractice, but a symbol of the disorganizing feudalism which he so\r\nenergetically labored to suppress. His temper led him rather to adopt\r\npacific measures, in sapping by the forms of law the foundations\r\nof the feudal power, than to break it down by force of arms as his\r\npredecessors had attempted. The centralization of the Roman polity\r\nmight well appear to him and his advisers the ideal of a well-ordered\r\nstate, and the royal supremacy had by this time advanced to a point\r\nwhere the gradual extension of the judicial prerogatives of the\r\ncrown might prove the surest mode of humbling eventually the haughty\r\nvassals who had so often bearded the sovereign. No legal procedure\r\nwas more closely connected with feudalism, or embodied its spirit\r\nmore thoroughly, than the wager of battle, and Louis accordingly did\r\nall that lay in his power to abrogate the custom. The royal authority\r\nwas strictly circumscribed, however, and though, in his celebrated\r\nOrdonnance of 1260, he formally prohibited the battle trial in the\r\nterritory subject to his jurisdiction,[726] he was obliged to admit\r\nthat he had no power to control the courts of his barons beyond the\r\ndomains of the crown.[727] Even within this comparatively limited\r\nsphere, we may fairly assume from some passages in the Établissements,\r\ncompiled about the year 1270, that he was unable to do away entirely\r\nwith the practice. It is to be found permitted in some cases both civil\r\nand criminal, of peculiarly knotty character, admitting of no other\r\napparent solution.[728] It seems, indeed, remarkable that he should\r\neven have authorized personal combat between brothers, in criminal\r\naccusations, only restricting them in civil suits to fighting by\r\nchampions,[729] when the German law of nearly the same period forbids\r\nthe duel, like marriage, between relations in the fifth degree, and\r\nstates that previously it had been prohibited to those connected in the\r\nseventh degree.[730]\r\n\r\nEven this qualified reform provoked determined opposition. Every motive\r\nof pride and interest prompted resistance. The prejudices of birth, the\r\nstrength of the feudal principle, the force of chivalric superstition,\r\nthe pride of self-reliance gave keener edge to the apprehension of\r\nlosing an assured source of revenue. The right of granting the wager of\r\nbattle was one of those appertaining to the _hauts-justiciers_, and so\r\nhighly was it esteemed that paintings of champions fighting frequently\r\nadorned their halls as emblems of their prerogatives; Loysel, indeed,\r\ndeduces from it a maxim, “The pillory, the gibbet, the iron collar, and\r\npaintings of champions engaged, are marks of high jurisdiction.”[731]\r\nThis right had a considerable money value, for the seigneur at whose\r\ncourt an appeal of battle was tried received from the defeated party\r\na fine of sixty livres if he was a gentleman, and sixty sous if a\r\nroturier, besides a perquisite of the horses and arms employed, and\r\nheavy mulcts for any delays which might be asked,[732] besides fines\r\nfrom those who withdrew after the combat was decreed.[733] Nor was\r\nthis all, for during the centuries of its existence there had grown\r\nand clustered around the custom an immeasurable mass of rights and\r\nprivileges which struggled lustily against destruction. Thus, hardly\r\nhad the ordonnance of prohibition been issued when, in 1260, a knight\r\nnamed Mathieu le Voyer actually brought suit against the king for the\r\nloss it inflicted upon him. He dolefully set forth that he enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of guarding the lists in all duels adjudged in the royal\r\ncourt at Corbon, for which he was entitled to receive a fee of five\r\nsous in each case; and, as his occupation thus was gone, he claimed\r\ncompensation, modestly suggesting that he be allowed the same tax\r\non all inquests held under the new law.[734] How closely all such\r\nsources of revenue were watched is illustrated by a case occurring in\r\n1286, when Philippe le Bel remitted the fines accruing to him from a\r\nduel between two squires adjudged in the royal court of Tours. The\r\nseneschal of Anjou and Touraine brought suit before the Parlement\r\nof Paris to recover one-third of the amount, as he was entitled to\r\nthat proportion of all dues arising from combats held within his\r\njurisdiction, and he argued that the liberality of the king was not to\r\nbe exercised to his disadvantage. His claim was pronounced just, and a\r\nverdict was rendered in his favor.[735]\r\n\r\nBut the loss of money was less important than the curtailment of\r\nprivilege and the threatened absorption of power of which this reform\r\nwas the precursor. Every step in advancing the influence of peaceful\r\njustice, as expounded by the jurists of the royal courts, was a heavy\r\nblow to the independence of the feudatories. They felt their ancestral\r\nrights assailed at the weakest point, and they instinctively recognized\r\nthat, as the jurisdiction of the royal bailiffs became extended, and as\r\nappeals to the court of the Parlement of Paris became more frequent,\r\ntheir importance was diminished, and their means of exercising a petty\r\ntyranny over those around them were abridged. Entangled in the mazes of\r\na code in which the unwonted maxims of Roman law were daily quoted with\r\nincreasing veneration, the impetuous seigneur found himself the prey\r\nof those whom he despised, and he saw that subtle lawyers were busily\r\nundoing the work at which his ancestors had labored for centuries.\r\nThese feelings are well portrayed in a song of the period, exhumed\r\nnot long since by Le Roux de Lincy. Written apparently by one of the\r\nsufferers, it gives so truthful a view of the conservative ideas of the\r\nthirteenth century that a translation of the first stanza may not be\r\namiss:—\r\n\r\n    Gent de France, mult estes esbahis!\r\n    Je di à touz ceus qui sont nez des fiez, etc.[736]\r\n\r\n      Ye men of France, dismayed and sore\r\n         Ye well may be. In sooth, I swear,\r\n      Gentles, so help me God, no more\r\n         Are ye the freemen that ye were!\r\n      Where is your freedom? Ye are brought\r\n         To trust your rights to inquest law,\r\n      Where tricks and quibbles set at naught\r\n         The sword your fathers wont to draw.\r\n      Land of the Franks!—no more that name\r\n         Is thine—a land of slaves art thou,\r\n      Of bondsmen, wittols, who to shame\r\n         And wrong must bend submissive now!\r\n\r\nEven legists—de Fontaines, whose admiration of the Digest led him on\r\nall occasions to seek an incongruous alliance between the customary\r\nand imperial law, and Beaumanoir, who in most things was far in\r\nadvance of his age, and who assisted so energetically in the work of\r\ncentralization—even these enlightened lawyers hesitate to object to the\r\nprinciples involved in the battle trial, and while disapproving of the\r\ncustom, express their views in language which contrasts strongly with\r\nthe vigorous denunciations of Frederic II. half a century earlier.[737]\r\n\r\nHow powerful were the influences thus brought to bear against the\r\ninnovation is shown by the fact that when the mild but firm hand\r\nof St. Louis no longer grasped the sceptre, his son and successor\r\ncould not maintain his father’s laws. In 1280 there is a record of\r\na duel adjudged in the king’s court between Jeanne de la Valete and\r\nthe Sire of Montricher on an accusation of arson;[738] and about 1283\r\nPhilippe even allowed himself to preside at a judicial duel, scarcely\r\nmore than twenty years after the promulgation of the ordonnance of\r\nprohibition.[739] The next monarch, Philippe le Bel, was at first\r\nguilty of the same weakness, for when in 1293 the Count of Armagnac\r\naccused Raymond Bernard of Foix of treason, a duel between them was\r\ndecreed, and they were compelled to fight before the king at Gisors;\r\nthough Robert d’Artois interfered after the combat had commenced, and\r\ninduced Philippe to separate the antagonists.[740] Philippe, however,\r\nwas too astute not to see that his interests lay in humbling feudalism\r\nin all its forms; while the rapid extension of the jurisdiction of the\r\ncrown, and the limitations on the seignorial courts, so successfully\r\ninvented and asserted by the lawyers, acting by means of the Parlement\r\nthrough the royal bailiffs, gave him power to carry his views into\r\neffect such as had been enjoyed by none of his predecessors. Able and\r\nunscrupulous, he took full advantage of his opportunities in every way,\r\nand the wager of battle was not long in experiencing the effect of his\r\nencroachments. Still, he proceeded step by step, and the vacillation of\r\nhis legislation shows how obstinate was the spirit with which he had\r\nto deal. In 1296 he prohibited the judicial duel in time of war, and\r\nin 1303 he was obliged to repeat the prohibition.[741] It was probably\r\nnot long after this that he interdicted the duel wholly[742]—possibly\r\nimpelled thereto by a case occurring in 1303, in which he is described\r\nas forced to grant the combat between two nobles, on an accusation\r\nof murder, very greatly against his wishes, and in spite of all his\r\nefforts to dissuade the appellant.[743]\r\n\r\nIn thus abrogating the wager of battle, Philippe le Bel was in advance\r\nof his age. Before three years were over he was forced to abandon\r\nthe position he had assumed; and though he gave as a reason for the\r\nrestoration of the duel that its absence had proved a fruitful source\r\nof encouragement for crime and villany,[744] yet at the same time he\r\ntook care to place on record the assertion of his own conviction that\r\nit was worthless as a means of seeking justice.[745] In thus legalizing\r\nit by the Ordonnance of 1306, however, he by no means replaced it on\r\nits former footing. It was restricted to criminal cases involving the\r\ndeath penalty, excepting theft, and it was only permitted when the\r\ncrime was notorious, the guilt of the accused probable, and no other\r\nevidence attainable.[746] The ceremonies prescribed, moreover, were\r\nfearfully expensive, and put it out of the reach of all except the\r\nwealthiest pleaders. As the ordonnance, which is very carefully drawn,\r\nonly refers to appeals made by the prosecutor, it may fairly be assumed\r\nthat the defendant could merely accept the challenge and had no right\r\nto offer it.\r\n\r\nEven with these limitations, Philippe was not disposed to sanction\r\nthe practice within the domains of the crown, for, the next year\r\n(1307), we find him commanding the seneschal of Toulouse to allow\r\nno duel to be adjudged in his court, but to send all cases in which\r\nthe combat might arise to the Parlement of Paris for decision.[747]\r\nThis was equivalent to a formal prohibition. During the whole of the\r\nperiod under consideration, numerous causes came before the Parlement\r\nconcerning challenges to battle, on appeals from various jurisdictions\r\nthroughout the country, and it is interesting to observe how uniformly\r\nsome valid reason was found for its refusal. In the public register of\r\ndecisions, extending from 1254 to 1318, scarcely a single example of\r\nits permission is to be found.[748] One doubtful instance which I have\r\nobserved is a curious case occurring in 1292, wherein a man accused\r\na woman of homicide in the court of the Chapter of Soissons, and the\r\nroyal officers interfered on the ground that the plaintiff was a\r\nbastard. As by the local custom he thus was in some sort a serf of the\r\ncrown, they assumed that he could not risk his body without the express\r\npermission of the king. The Chapter contended for the appellant’s\r\nlegitimacy, and the case became so much obscured by the loss of the\r\nrecord of examination made, that the Parlement finally shuffled it out\r\nof court without any definite decision.[749]\r\n\r\nTwo decisions, in 1309, show that the Ordonnance of 1306 was in force,\r\nfor while they admit that the duel was legally possible, the cases\r\nare settled by inquest as capable of proof by investigation. One of\r\nthese was an incident in the old quarrel between the Counts of Foix\r\nand Armagnac, and its decision shows how great a stride had been made\r\nsince their duel of 1293. Raymond de Cardone, a kinsman of Foix, gaged\r\nhis battle in the king’s court against Armagnac; Armagnac did the same\r\nagainst Foix and claimed that his challenge had priority over that\r\nof Raymond, while Bernard de Comminges also demanded battle of Foix.\r\nAll these challenges arose out of predatory border incursions between\r\nthese nobles, and in its verdict the Parlement refuses to grant the\r\ncombat in any of them, orders all the parties to swear peace and give\r\nbail to keep it, and moreover condemns Foix in heavy damages to his\r\nadversaries and to the king, whose territories he had invaded in one\r\nof his forays. The Count of Foix made some objection to submitting to\r\nthe sentence, but a short imprisonment brought him to his senses.[750]\r\nA more thorough vindication of the royal jurisdiction over powerful\r\nfeudatories could scarcely be imagined, and the work of the civil\r\nlawyers seemed to be perfectly accomplished. It was the same with all\r\nthe variety of cases involving the duel which were brought to the\r\ncognizance of the Parlement. Some ingenious excuse was always found for\r\nrefusing it, whether by denying the jurisdiction of the court which had\r\ngranted it, or by alleging other reasons more or less frivolous, the\r\nevident intention of all the _arrêts_ being to restrict the custom,\r\nas allowed under the ordonnance, within limits so narrow as to render\r\nit practically a nullity. The astute lawyers who composed the royal\r\ncourt knew too well the work committed to them to hesitate as to their\r\nconclusions, while Philippe’s distaste for the duel probably received\r\na stimulus when, at the Council of Vienne in 1312 he endeavored to\r\nobtain the condemnation of the memory of Boniface VIII., and two\r\nCatalan knights offered to prove by the single combat that the late\r\npope had been legitimately elected and had not been a heretic.[751]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these efforts, the progress of reform was slow. On the\r\nbreaking out afresh of the perennial contest with Flanders, Philippe\r\nfound himself, in 1314, obliged to repeat his order of 1296, forbidding\r\nall judicial combats during the war, and holding suspended such as were\r\nin progress.[752] As these duels could have little real importance\r\nin crippling his military resources, it is evident that he seized\r\nsuch occasions to accomplish under the war power what his peaceful\r\nprerogative was unable to effect, and it is a striking manifestation of\r\nhis zeal in the cause, that he could turn aside to give attention to it\r\namid the preoccupations of the exhausting struggle with the Flemings.\r\nYet how little impression he made, and how instinctively the popular\r\nmind still turned to the battle ordeal, as the surest resource in all\r\ncases of doubt, is well illustrated by a passage in a rhyming chronicle\r\nof the day. When the close of Philippe’s long and prosperous reign was\r\ndarkened by the terrible scandal of his three daughters-in-law, and two\r\nof them were convicted of adultery, Godefroy de Paris makes the third,\r\nJeanne, wife of Philippe le Long, offer at once to prove her innocence\r\nby the combat:—\r\n\r\n    Gentil roy, je vous requier, sire,\r\n    Que vous m’oiez en defendant.\r\n    Se nul ou nule demandant\r\n    Me vait chose de mauvestie,\r\n    Mon cuer sens si pur, si haitie,\r\n    Que bonement me deffendrai,\r\n    Ou tel champion baillerai,\r\n    Qui bien saura mon droit deffendre,\r\n    S’il vous plest à mon gage prendre.[753]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe iron hand of Philippe was no sooner withdrawn than the nobles made\r\ndesperate efforts to throw off the yoke which he had so skilfully and\r\nrelentlessly imposed on them. His son, Louis Hutin, not yet firmly\r\nseated on the throne, was constrained to yield a portion of the\r\nnewly-acquired prerogative. The nobles of Burgundy, for instance, in\r\ntheir formal list of grievances, demanded the restoration of the wager\r\nof battle as a right of the accused in criminal cases, and Louis was\r\nobliged to promise that they should enjoy it according to ancient\r\ncustom.[754] Those of Amiens and Vermandois were equally clamorous, and\r\nfor their benefit he re-enacted the Ordonnance of 1306, permitting the\r\nduel in criminal prosecutions where other evidence was deficient, with\r\nan important extension authorizing its application to cases of theft,\r\nin opposition to previous usage.[755] A legal record, compiled about\r\n1325 to illustrate the customs of Picardy, shows by a group of cases\r\nthat it was still quite common, and that indeed it was the ordinary\r\ndefence in accusations of homicide.[756] The nobles of Champagne\r\ndemanded similar privileges, but Louis, by the right of his mother,\r\nJeanne de Champagne, was Count of Champagne, and his authority was\r\nless open to dispute. He did not venture on a decided refusal, but an\r\nevasive answer, which was tantamount to a denial of the request,[757]\r\nshowed that his previous concessions were extorted, and not willingly\r\ngranted. Not content with this, the Champenois repeated their demand,\r\nand received the dry response, that the existing edicts on the subject\r\nmust be observed.[758]\r\n\r\nThe threatened disturbances were avoided, and during the succeeding\r\nyears the centralization of jurisdiction in the royal courts made rapid\r\nprogress. It is a striking evidence of the successful working of the\r\nplans of St. Louis and Philippe le Bel that several ordonnances and\r\ncharters granted by Philippe le Long in 1318 and 1319, while promising\r\nreforms in the procedures of the bailiffs and seneschals, and in the\r\nmanner of holding inquests, are wholly silent on the subject of the\r\nduel, affording a fair inference that complaints on that score were\r\nno longer made.[759] Philip of Valois was especially energetic in\r\nmaintaining the royal jurisdiction, and when in 1330 he was obliged\r\nto restrict the abusive use of appeals from the local courts to\r\nthe Parlement,[760] it is evident that the question of granting or\r\nwithholding the wager of battle had become practically a prerogative of\r\nthe crown. That the challenging of witnesses must ere long have fallen\r\ninto desuetude is shown by an edict of Charles VI., issued in 1396,\r\nby which he ordered that the testimony of women should be received in\r\nevidence in all the courts throughout his kingdom.[761]\r\n\r\nThough the duel was thus deprived, in France, of its importance as an\r\nordinary legal procedure, yet it was by no means extinguished, nor had\r\nit lost its hold upon the confidence of the people. An instructive\r\nillustration of this is afforded by the well-known story of the Dog\r\nof Montargis. Though the learned Bullet[762] has demonstrated the\r\nfabulous nature of this legend, and has traced its paternity up to\r\nthe Carlovingian romances, still, the fact is indubitable that it was\r\nlong believed to have occurred in 1371, under the reign of Charles le\r\nSage, and that authors nearly contemporary with that period recount the\r\ncombat of the dog and the knight as an unquestionable fact, admiring\r\ngreatly the sagacity of the animal, and regarding as a matter of course\r\nboth the extraordinary judicial proceedings and the righteous judgment\r\nof God which gave the victory to the greyhound.\r\n\r\nIn 1371 there was battle gaged between Sir Thomas Felton, Seneschal of\r\nAquitaine, and Raymond de Caussade, Seigneur de Puycornet. Apparently\r\nthey felt that a fair field could not be had in either French or\r\nEnglish territory, and they applied to Pedro el Ceremonioso of\r\nAragon to provide the lists for them. Pedro acceded to the request\r\nand promised to preside, provided there was due cause for a judicial\r\nduel and that the arms were agreed upon in advance, and he sent the\r\ncombatants safe-conducts to come to Aragon. He assigned the city of\r\nValencia as the place of combat, and when there was an endeavor to\r\nbreak off the affair on the ground that it concerned the kings of\r\nFrance and England, he replied that it was now too late and that the\r\nbattle must take place.[763]\r\n\r\nIn 1386, the Parlement of Paris was occupied with a subtle discussion\r\nas to whether the accused was obliged, in cases where battle was gaged,\r\nto give the lie to the appellant, under pain of being considered to\r\nconfess the crime charged, and it was decided that the lie was not\r\nessential.[764] The same year occurred the celebrated duel between\r\nthe Chevalier de Carrouges and Jacques le Gris, to witness which the\r\nking shortened a campaign, and in which the appellant was seconded by\r\nWaleran, Count of St. Pol, son-in-law of the Black Prince. Nothing can\r\nwell be more impressive than the scene so picturesquely described by\r\nFroissart. The cruelly wronged Dame de Carrouges, clothed in black,\r\nis mounted on a sable scaffold, watching the varying chances of the\r\nunequal combat between her husband, weakened by disease, and his\r\nvigorous antagonist, with the fearful certainty that, if strength alone\r\nprevail, he must die a shameful death and she be consigned to the\r\nstake. Hope grows faint and fainter; a grievous wound seems to place\r\nCarrouges at the mercy of his adversary, until at the last moment,\r\nwhen all appeared lost, she sees the avenger drive his sword through\r\nthe body of his prostrate enemy, vindicating at once his wife’s honor\r\nand his own good cause.[765] Froissart, however, was rather an artist\r\nthan an historian; he would not risk the effect of his picture by too\r\nrigid an adherence to facts, and he omits to mention, what is told by\r\nthe cooler Juvenal des Ursins, that Le Gris was subsequently proved\r\ninnocent by the death-bed confession of the real offender.[766] To make\r\nthe tragedy complete, the Anonyme de S. Denis adds that the miserable\r\nDame de Carrouges, overwhelmed with remorse at having unwittingly\r\ncaused the disgrace and death of an innocent man, ended her days in a\r\nconvent.[767] So striking a proof of the injustice of the battle ordeal\r\nis said by some writers to have caused the abandonment of the practice;\r\nbut this, as will be seen, is an error, though no further trace of the\r\ncombat as a judicial procedure is to be found on the registers of the\r\nParlement of Paris.[768]\r\n\r\nStill, it was popularly regarded as an unfailing resource. Thus, in\r\n1390, two women were accused at the Châtelet of Paris of sorcery. After\r\nrepeated torture, a confession implicating both was extracted from\r\none of them, but the other persisted in her denial, and challenged\r\nher companion to the duel by way of disproving her evidence. In the\r\nrecord of the proceedings the challenge is duly entered, but no notice\r\nwhatever seems to have been taken of it by the court, showing that it\r\nwas no longer a legal mode of trial in such cases.[769]\r\n\r\nIn 1409, the battle trial was materially limited by an ordonnance of\r\nCharles VI. prohibiting its employment except when specially granted\r\nby the king or the Parlement;[770] and though the latter body may\r\nnever have exercised the privilege thus conferred upon it, the king\r\noccasionally did, as we find him during the same year presiding at a\r\njudicial duel between Guillaume Bariller, a Breton knight, and John\r\nCarrington, an Englishman.[771] The English occupation of France, under\r\nHenry V. and the Regent Bedford, revived the practice, and removed for\r\na time the obstacles to its employment. Nicholas Upton, writing in the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, repeatedly alludes to the numerous\r\ncases in which he assisted as officer of the Earl of Salisbury,\r\nLieutenant of the King of England; and in his chapters devoted to\r\ndefining the different species of duel he betrays a singular confusion\r\nbetween the modern ideas of reparation of honor and the original object\r\nof judicial investigation, thus fairly illustrating the transitional\r\ncharacter of the period.[772]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy, formally\r\nabolished the wager of battle, as far as lay in his power, throughout\r\nthe extensive dominions of which he was sovereign, and in the Coutumier\r\nof Burgundy, as revised by him in 1459, there is no trace of it to be\r\nfound. The code in force in Britanny until 1539 permitted it in cases\r\nof contested estates, and of treason, theft, and perjury—the latter,\r\nas usual, extending it over a considerable range of civil actions,\r\nwhile the careful particularization of details by the code shows that\r\nit was not merely a judicial antiquity.[773] In Normandy, the legal\r\nexistence of the judicial duel was even more prolonged, for it was not\r\nuntil the revision of the coutumier in 1583, under Henry III., that\r\nthe privilege of deciding in this way numerous cases, both civil and\r\ncriminal, was formally abolished.[774] Still, it may be assumed that,\r\npractically, the custom had long been obsolete, though the tardy\r\nprocess of revising the local customs allowed it to remain upon the\r\nstatute book to so late a date. The fierce mountaineers of remote Béarn\r\nclung to it more obstinately, and in the last revision of their code,\r\nin 1552, which remained unaltered until 1789, it retains its place as a\r\nlegitimate means of proof, in default of other testimony, with a heavy\r\npenalty on the party who did not appear upon the field at the appointed\r\ntime.[775]\r\n\r\nDuring this long period, examples are to be found which show that\r\nalthough the combat was falling into disuse, it was still a legal\r\nprocedure, which in certain cases could be claimed as a right, or which\r\ncould be decreed and enforced by competent judicial authority. Among\r\nthe privileges of the town of Valenciennes was one to the effect that\r\nany homicide taking refuge there could swear that the act had been\r\ncommitted in self-defence, when he could be appealed only in battle.\r\nThis gave occasion to a combat in 1455 between a certain Mahuot and\r\nJacotin Plouvier, the former of whom had killed a kinsman of the\r\nlatter. Neither party desired the battle, but the municipal government\r\ninsisted upon it, and furnished them with instructors to teach the\r\nuse of the club and buckler allowed as arms. The Comte de Charolois,\r\nCharles le Téméraire, endeavored to prevent the useless cruelty, but\r\nthe city held any interference as an infringement of its chartered\r\nrights; and, after long negotiations, Philippe le Bon, the suzerain,\r\nauthorized the combat and was present at it. The combatants, according\r\nto custom, had the head shaved and the nails pared on both hands and\r\nfeet; they were dressed from head to foot in a tight-fitting suit of\r\nhardened leather, and each was anointed with grease to prevent his\r\nantagonist from clutching him. The combat was long and desperate,\r\nbut at length the appellant literally tore out the heart of his\r\nantagonist.[776] Such incidents among roturiers, however, were rare.\r\nMore frequently some fiery gentleman claimed the right of vindicating\r\nhis quarrel at the risk of his life. Thus, in 1482, shortly after\r\nthe battle of Nancy had reinstated René, Duke of Lorraine, on the\r\nruins of the second house of Burgundy, two gentlemen of the victor’s\r\ncourt, quarrelling over the spoils of the battle-field, demanded\r\nthe _champ-clos_; it was duly granted, and on the appointed day the\r\nappellant was missing, to the great discomfiture and no little loss\r\nof his bail.[777] When Charles d’Armagnac, in 1484, complained to the\r\nStates General of the inhuman destruction of his family, committed by\r\norder of Louis XI., the Sieur de Castlenau, whom he accused of having\r\npoisoned his mother, the Comtesse d’Armagnac, appeared before the\r\nassembly, and, his advocate denying the charge, presented his offer\r\nto prove his innocence by single combat.[778] In 1518, Henry II. of\r\nNavarre ordered a judicial duel at Pau between two contestants, of whom\r\nthe appellant made default; the defendant was accordingly pronounced\r\ninnocent, and was empowered to drag through all cities, villages, and\r\nother places through which he might pass, the escutcheon and effigy of\r\nhis adversary, who was further punished by the prohibition thenceforth\r\nto wear arms or knightly bearings.[779] In 1538, Francis I. granted\r\nthe combat between Jean du Plessis and Gautier de Dinteville, which\r\nwould appear to have been essentially a judicial proceeding, since the\r\ndefendant, not appearing at the appointed time, was condemned to death\r\nby sentence of the high council, Feb. 20, 1538.[780] The duel thus\r\nwas evidently still a matter of law, which vindicated its majesty by\r\npunishing the unlucky contestant who shrank from the arbitrament of the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the celebrated combat between\r\nChastaigneraye and Jarnac, in 1547, wherein the death of the former,\r\na favorite of Henry II., led the monarch to take a solemn oath never\r\nto authorize another judicial duel. Two years later, two young nobles\r\nof his court, Jacques de Fontaine, Sieur de Fendilles, and Claude des\r\nGuerres, Baron de Vienne-le-Chatel, desired to settle in this manner\r\na disgusting accusation brought against the latter by the former.\r\nThe king, having debarred himself from granting the appeal, arranged\r\nthe matter by allowing Robert de la Marck, Marshal of France, and\r\nsovereign Prince of Sedan, to permit it in the territory of which\r\nhe was suzerain. Fendilles was so sure of success that he refused\r\nto enter the lists until a gallows was erected and a stake lighted,\r\nwhere his adversary after defeat was to be gibbeted and burned. Their\r\nonly weapons were broad-swords, and at the first pass Fendilles\r\ninflicted on his opponent a fearful gash in the thigh. Des Guerres,\r\nseeing that loss of blood would soon reduce him to extremity, closed\r\nwith his antagonist, and being a skilful wrestler speedily threw him.\r\nReduced to his natural weapons, he could only inflict blows with the\r\nfist, which failing strength rendered less and less effective, when a\r\nscaffold crowded with ladies and gentlemen gave way, throwing down the\r\nspectators in a shrieking mass. Taking advantage of the confusion, the\r\nfriends of Des Guerres violated the law which imposed absolute silence\r\nand neutrality on all, and called to him to blind and suffocate his\r\nadversary with sand. Des Guerres promptly took the hint, and Fendilles\r\nsuccumbed to this unknightly weapon. Whether he formally yielded or\r\nnot was disputed. Des Guerres claimed that he should undergo the\r\npunishment of the gallows and stake prepared for himself, but de la\r\nMarck interfered, and the combatants were both suffered to retire in\r\npeace.[781] This is the last recorded instance of the wager of battle\r\nin France. The custom appears never to have been formally abolished,\r\nand so little did it represent the thoughts and feelings of the age\r\nwhich witnessed the Reformation, that when, in 1566, Charles IX. issued\r\nan edict prohibiting duels, no allusion was made to the judicial\r\ncombat. The encounters which he sought to prevent were solely those\r\nwhich arose from points of honor between gentlemen, and the offended\r\nparty was ordered not to appeal to the courts, but to lay his case\r\nbefore the Marshals of France, or the governor of his province.[782]\r\nThe custom had died a natural death. No ordonnance was necessary to\r\nabrogate it; and, seemingly, from forgetfulness, the crown and the\r\nParlement appear never to have been divested of the right to adjudge\r\nthe wager of battle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Italy many causes conspired to lead to the abrogation of the\r\njudicial duel. On the one hand there were the prescriptions of the\r\npopes, and on the other the spirit of scepticism fostered by the\r\nexample of Frederic II. The influence of the resuscitated Roman law was\r\nearly felt and its principles were diffused by the illustrious jurists\r\nwho rendered the Italian schools famous. Burgher life, moreover, was\r\nprecociously developed in the social and political organization,\r\nand as the imperial influence diminished with the fall of the House\r\nof Hohenstaufen, the cities assumed self-government and fashioned\r\ntheir local legislation after their own ideals. The judgments of God\r\nwere not indigenous in Italy; they were not ancestral customs rooted\r\nin the prehistoric past, but were foreign devices introduced by\r\nconquerors—first by the Lombards and then by the Othos. There were\r\nthus many reasons why the trial by combat should disappear early from\r\nthe Italian statute books. There is no trace of it in the elaborate\r\ncriminal code of Milan compiled in 1338, nor in that of Piacenza\r\nsomewhat later; in fact, it was no longer needed, for the inquisitional\r\nprocess was in full operation and in doubtful cases the judge had all\r\nthe resources of torture at his disposal.[783]\r\n\r\nAlthough by the middle of the fourteenth century it had thus\r\ndisappeared from the written law, the rulers retained the right to\r\ngrant it in special cases, and it thus continued in existence as a\r\nlawful though extra-legal mode of settling disputed cases. Where\r\nsuzerains were so numerous there was thus ample opportunity for\r\nbelligerent pleaders to gratify their desires. Even as late as 1507\r\nGiovanni Paolo Baglioni, lord of Spello (a village in the Duchy of\r\nSpoleto, near Foligno), granted a licence for a month to Giovanni\r\nBatta Gaddi and Raffaello Altoviti to settle their suits by fighting\r\nwithin his domain with three comrades.[784] Two years after this,\r\nJulius II., in issuing a constitution directed against duels of honor,\r\ntook occasion also to include in his prohibition all such _purgationes\r\nvulgares_, even though permitted by the laws; the combatants were\r\nordered, in all the States of the Church, to be arrested and punished\r\nfor homicide or maiming according to the common law.[785] In 1519 Leo\r\nX. reissued this bull with vastly sharper penalties on all concerned,\r\nbut in his additions to it he seems merely to have in mind the duel\r\nof honor, which was habitually conducted in public, in lists prepared\r\nfor the purpose, and in presence of the prince or noble who had\r\ngranted licence for it.[786] The legal combat may be considered to\r\nhave virtually disappeared, but the duel of honor which succeeded it\r\ninherited some of its sanctions, and in the learned treatises on the\r\nsubject which appeared during the first half of the sixteenth century\r\nthere are still faint traces to be found of the survival of the idea of\r\nthe judgment of God.[787]\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, it was not until 1486 that any attempt was made to restrict\r\nthe judicial duel. In that year Matthias Corvinus prohibited it in\r\ncases where direct testimony was procurable: where such evidence\r\nwas unattainable, he still permitted it, both in civil and criminal\r\nmatters.[788] In 1492 Vladislas II. repeated this prohibition, alleging\r\nas his reason for the restriction the almost universal employment of\r\nchampions who sometimes sold out their principals. The terms of the\r\ndecree show that previously its use was general, though it is declared\r\nto be a custom unknown elsewhere.[789]\r\n\r\nIn Flanders, it is somewhat remarkable that the duel should have\r\nlingered until late in the sixteenth century, although, as we have seen\r\nabove, the commercial spirit of that region had sought its abrogation\r\nat a very early period, and had been seconded by the efforts of\r\nPhilippe le Bon in the fifteenth century. Damhouder, writing about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, states that it was still legal\r\nin matters of public concern, and even his severe training as a\r\ncivil lawyer cannot prevent his declaring it to be laudable in such\r\naffairs.[790] Indeed, when the Council of Trent, in 1563, stigmatized\r\nthe duel as the work of the devil and prohibited all potentates from\r\ngranting it under pain of excommunication and forfeiture of all feudal\r\npossessions,[791] the state Council of Flanders, in their report to the\r\nDuchess of Parma on the reception of the Council, took exception to\r\nthis canon, and decided that the ruler ought not to be deprived of the\r\npower of ordering the combat.[792] In this view, the Council of Namur\r\nagreed.[793]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, in spite of the imperial legislation referred to above (p.\r\n212), feudal influences were too strong to permit an early abrogation\r\nof the custom. Throughout the fifteenth century the wager of battle\r\ncontinued to flourish, and MSS. of the period give full directions as\r\nto the details of the various procedures for patricians and plebeians.\r\nThe sixteenth century saw its wane, though it kept its place in the\r\nstatute books, and _Fechtbücher_ of 1543 and 1556 describe fully\r\nthe use of the club and the knife. Yet when in 1535 Friedrich von\r\nSchwartzenberg demanded a judicial duel to settle a suit with Ludwig\r\nvon Hutten, the latter contemptuously replied that such things might\r\nbe permitted in the times of Goliath and Dietrich of Bern, but that\r\nnow they were not in accordance with law, right, or custom, and von\r\nSchwartzenberg was obliged to settle the case in more peaceful fashion.\r\nStill, occasional instances of its use are said to have occurred\r\nuntil the close of the century,[794] and as late as 1607, Henry, Duke\r\nof Lorraine, procured from the Emperor Rodolph II. the confirmation\r\nof a privilege which he claimed as ancestral that all combats\r\noccurring between the Rhine and the Meuse should be fought out in his\r\npresence.[795]\r\n\r\nIn Russia, under the code known as the Ulogenié Zakonof, promulgated in\r\n1498, any culprit, after his accuser’s testimony was in, could claim\r\nthe duel; and as both parties went to the field accompanied by all the\r\nfriends they could muster, the result was not infrequently a bloody\r\nskirmish. These abuses were put an end to by the Sudebtnick, issued in\r\n1550, and the duel was regulated after a more decent fashion, but it\r\ncontinued to flourish legally until it was finally abrogated in 1649\r\nby the Czar Alexis Mikhailovich, in the code known as the Sobornoié\r\nUlogenié. The more enlightened branch of the Slavonic race, however,\r\nthe Poles, abolished it in the fourteenth century; but Macieiowski\r\nstates that in Servia and Bulgaria the custom has been preserved to the\r\npresent day.[796]\r\n\r\nIn other countries, the custom likewise lingered to a comparatively\r\nlate period. Scotland, indeed, was somewhat more forward than her\r\nneighbors; for in the year 1400, her Parliament showed the influence of\r\nadvancing civilization by limiting the practice in several important\r\nparticulars, which, if strictly observed, must have rendered it almost\r\nobsolete. Four conditions were pronounced essential prerequisites: the\r\naccusation must be for a capital crime; the offence must have been\r\ncommitted secretly and by treachery; reasonable cause of suspicion must\r\nbe shown against the accused, and direct testimony both of witnesses\r\nand documents must be wanting.[797]\r\n\r\nStill the “perfervidum ingenium Scotorum” clung to the arbitrament of\r\nthe sword with great tenacity. In 1532 Sir James Douglass accused his\r\nson-in-law Robert Charteris of treason, and the charge was settled\r\nby a judicial duel in the presence of James V., who put an end to it\r\nwhen Charteris’s sword broke.[798] Knox relates that in 1562, when\r\nthe Earl of Arran was consulting with him and others respecting a\r\nproposed accusation against Bothwell for high treason, arising out\r\nof a plan for seizing Queen Mary which Bothwell had suggested, the\r\nearl remarked, “I know that he will offer the combate unto me, but\r\nthat would not be suffered in France, but I will do that which I have\r\nproposed.” In 1567, also, when Bothwell underwent a mock trial for\r\nthe murder of Darnley, he offered to justify himself by the duel; and\r\nwhen the Lords of the Congregation took up arms against him, alleging\r\nas a reason the murder and his presumed designs against the infant\r\nJames VI., Queen Mary’s proclamation against the rebels recites his\r\nchallenge as a full disproval of the charges. When the armies were\r\ndrawn up at Carberry Hill, Bothwell again came forward and renewed\r\nhis challenge. James Murray, who had already offered to accept it,\r\ntook it up at once, but Bothwell refused to meet him on account of the\r\ninequality in their rank. Murray’s brother, William of Tullibardin,\r\nthen offered himself, and Bothwell again declined, as the Laird of\r\nTullibardin was not a peer of the realm. Many nobles then eagerly\r\nproposed to take his place, and Lord Lindsay especially insisted on\r\nbeing allowed the privilege of proving the charge on Bothwell’s body,\r\nbut the latter delayed on various pretexts, until Queen Mary was able\r\nto prohibit the combat.[799] The last judicial duels fought in Scotland\r\nwere two which occurred as the sixteenth century was closing. In 1595,\r\nunder a warrant from James VI. John Brown met George Hepburn and was\r\nvanquished, though his life was spared at the request of the judges. In\r\n1597 Adam Bruntfield charged James Carmichael with causing the death\r\nof his brother, and under royal licence fought and slew him before a\r\ncrowd of five thousand spectators. Yet even this was not the end of\r\nthe legal custom, for in 1603 an accusation of treason against Francis\r\nMowbray was adjudged to be settled by the duel, though the combat was\r\nprevented by Mowbray meeting his death in an attempt to escape from\r\nprison, after which he was duly hanged and quartered.[800]\r\n\r\nIn England, the resolute conservatism, which resists innovation to the\r\nlast, prolonged the existence of the wager of battle until a period\r\nunknown in other enlightened nations. No doubt a reason for this may\r\nbe found in the rise of the jury trial towards the end of the twelfth\r\ncentury, which, as we have seen above (p. 144), furnished an effective\r\nsubstitute for the combat in doubtful cases. As the jury system\r\ndeveloped itself in both civil and criminal matters the sphere of the\r\nduel became more limited, in practice if not in theory, and its evils\r\nbeing thus less felt the necessity for its formal abrogation was less\r\npressing.[801] It was thus enabled to hold its place as a recognized\r\nform of procedure to a later period than in any other civilized land.\r\nAlready in the first quarter of the thirteenth century Mr. Maitland\r\ntells us that in criminal cases it had become uncommon, but the\r\nnumber of examples of it which he gives shows that this can only be\r\nin comparison with its greater frequency in the preceding century and\r\nthat it was still in common use notwithstanding the tendency of the\r\njudges to disallow it.[802] At the close of the fourteenth century,\r\nwhen France was engaged in rendering it rapidly obsolete, Thomas, Duke\r\nof Gloucester, dedicated to his nephew Richard II. a treatise detailing\r\nelaborately the practice followed in the Marshal’s court with respect\r\nto judicial duels.[803] Even a century later, legislation was obtained\r\nto prevent its avoidance in certain cases. The “Statute of Gloucester”\r\n(6 Ed. II. cap. 9), in 1333, had given to the appellant a year and a\r\nday in which to bring his appeal of death—a privilege allowed the widow\r\nor next of kin to put the accused on a second trial after an acquittal\r\non a public indictment—which, as a private suit, was usually determined\r\nby the combat. In practice, this privilege was generally rendered\r\nunavailing by postponing the public prosecution until the expiration\r\nof the delay, so as to prevent the appeal. In 1486, however, a law was\r\npassed to diminish the frequency of murder, which required the trial to\r\nbe finished before the expiration of the year and day, and ordered the\r\njustices, in case of acquittal, to hold the defendant in prison or on\r\nbail until the time had passed, so as to insure to the widow or next of\r\nkin the opportunity of prosecuting the appeal of death.[804] Another\r\nevidence of the prevalence of the custom is to be found in the rule\r\nwhich, in the fifteenth century, permitted a priest to shrive a man who\r\nwas about to wage his battle, without regard to the fact as to whose\r\nparishioner he might legally be—\r\n\r\n    And of mon that schal go fyghte\r\n    In a bateyl for hys ryghte,\r\n    Hys schryft also thou myghte here,\r\n    Thagh he thy pareschen neuer were.[805]\r\n\r\nWith the advance of civilization and refinement, the custom gradually\r\ndeclined, but it was not abolished. The last duel fought out in\r\nEngland is said to be one in 1492 between Sir James Parker and Hugh\r\nVaughan, arising from a grant of armorial bearings to Vaughan; it\r\nwas fought on horseback with lances, and at the first course Vaughan\r\nslew his antagonist.[806] Still the old laws remained unaltered, and\r\nan occasional appeal to them, while it offended men’s common sense,\r\nwas insufficient to cause their repeal. In 1571 a case occurred, as\r\nSpelman says, “non sine magna jurisconsultorum perturbatione,” when,\r\nto determine the title to an estate in Kent, Westminster Hall was\r\nforced to adjourn to Tothill Fields, and all the preliminary forms of\r\na combat were literally enacted with the most punctilious exactness,\r\nthough an accommodation between the parties saved the skulls of their\r\nchampions.[807] In 1583, however, a judicial duel was actually fought\r\nin Ireland between two O’Connors on an accusation of treason brought\r\nby one against the other, which ended by the appellant cutting off\r\nthe defendant’s head and presenting it on his sword’s point to the\r\njustices.[808]\r\n\r\nA device, peculiar to the English jurisprudence, allowed a man indicted\r\nfor a capital offence to turn “approver,” by confessing the crime and\r\ncharging or appealing any one he choose as an accomplice, and this\r\nappeal was usually settled by the single combat. Indeed, even when a\r\ncriminal had confessed he was sometimes pardoned on condition of his\r\nbeing victorious in a specified number of duels, and thus compounding\r\nfor his own life by the service rendered to society in relieving it\r\nof so many malefactors, as in a case in 1221 where a confessed thief\r\n“became approver to fight five battles.”[809] The custom continued\r\nto be a feature of criminal jurisprudence sufficiently important to\r\nrequire legislation as late as the year 1599, when the Act 41 Eliz.\r\nchap. 3 was passed to regulate the nice questions which attended\r\nappeals of several persons against one, or of one person against\r\nseveral. In the former case, the appellee, if victorious in the first\r\nduel, was acquitted; in the latter, the appellor was obliged to fight\r\nsuccessively with all the appellees.[810] In civil suits the last case\r\non record, I believe, is that of Claxton _v._ Lilburn, which shows\r\ncuriously enough the indisposition to put an end to what was regarded\r\nby common consent as a solecism. A valuable estate in Durham, said to\r\nbe worth more than £200 a year, was the subject in dispute. Claxton\r\nhad been unsuccessful in a suit for its recovery, and had brought a\r\nnew action, to which Lilburn responded, Aug. 6th, 1638, by producing\r\nin court his champion, George Cheney, in array, armed with a sandbag\r\nand battoon, who cast into the court his gauntlet with five small pence\r\nin it, and demanded battle. Claxton rejoined by producing a champion\r\nsimilarly armed, and gaged his battle. The court was nonplussed,\r\nputting off the proceedings from day to day, and seeking some excuse\r\nfor refusing the combat. The champions were interrogated, and both\r\nadmitted that they were hired for money. King Charles demanded the\r\nopinion of the Chief Justice and all his barons whether this was\r\nsufficient to invalidate the proceedings, but they unanimously replied\r\nthat after battle was gaged and sureties given, such confession was\r\nno bar to its being carried out. The King then ordered his judges if\r\npossible to find some just way for its prevention, but they apparently\r\ncould do nothing save procrastinate the matter for years, for in 1641\r\nLilburn petitioned the Long Parliament, setting forth that he had\r\nrepeatedly claimed his right of battle and had produced his champion,\r\nbut was ever put off by the judges finding some error in the record.\r\nParliament thereupon ordered a bill to be brought in taking away the\r\njudicial combat.[811] It was not enacted however, and Sir Matthew Hale,\r\nwriting towards the close of the century, feels obliged to describe\r\nwith considerable minuteness the various niceties of the law, though he\r\nis able to speak of the combat as “an unusual trial at this day.”[812]\r\n\r\nIn 1774, the subject incidentally attracted attention in a manner not\r\nvery creditable to the enlightenment of English legislation. When, to\r\npunish the rebellious Bostonians for destroying the obnoxious tea,\r\na “Bill for the improved administration of justice in the province\r\nof Massachusetts Bay” was passed, it originally contained a clause\r\ndepriving the New Englanders of the appeal of death, by which, it will\r\nbe remembered, a man acquitted of a charge of murder could be again\r\nprosecuted by the next of kin, and the question could be determined\r\nby the wager of battle. The denial of this ancestral right aroused\r\nthe indignation of the liberal party in the House of Commons, and\r\nthe point was warmly contested. The learned and eloquent Dunning,\r\nafterwards Lord Ashburton, one of the leaders of opposition, defended\r\nthe ancient custom in the strongest terms. “I rise,” said he, “to\r\nsupport that great pillar of the constitution, the appeal for murder;\r\nI fear there is a wish to establish a precedent for taking it away\r\nin England as well as in the colonies. It is called a remnant of\r\nbarbarism and gothicism. The whole of our constitution, for aught I\r\nknow, is gothic.... I wish, sir, that gentlemen would be a little more\r\ncautious, and consider that the yoke we are framing for the despised\r\ncolonists may be tied round our own necks!” Even Burke was heard to\r\nlift a warning voice against the proposed innovation, and the obnoxious\r\nclause had to be struck out before the ministerial majority could pass\r\nthe bill.[813] Something was said about reforming the law throughout\r\nthe empire, but it was not done, and the beauty of the “great pillar of\r\nthe constitution,” the appeal of death, was shown when the nineteenth\r\ncentury was disgraced by the resurrection of all the barbaric elements\r\nof criminal jurisprudence. In 1818, the case of Ashford _vs._ Thornton\r\ncreated much excitement. Ashford was the brother of a murdered girl,\r\nwhose death, under circumstances of peculiar atrocity, was charged\r\nupon Thornton, with much appearance of probability. Acquitted on a\r\njury trial, Thornton was appealed by Ashford, when he pleaded “Not\r\nguilty, and I am ready to defend the same by my body.” After elaborate\r\nargument, Lord Ellenborough, with the unanimous assent of his brother\r\njustices, sustained the appellee’s right to this as “the usual and\r\nconstitutional mode of trial,” expounding the law in almost the same\r\nterms as those which we read in Bracton and Beaumanoir.[814] The\r\ncurious crowd was sorely disappointed when the appellant withdrew, and\r\nthe chief justice was relieved from the necessity of presiding over a\r\ngladiatorial exhibition. A similar case occurred almost simultaneously\r\nin Ireland, and the next year the Act 59 Geo. III. chap. 46, at length\r\nput an end to this remnant of Teutonic barbarism.[815]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerica, inheriting the blessings of English law, inherited also its\r\ndefects. The colonies enjoyed the privilege of the appeal of death,\r\nagainst the abrogation of which, in the province of Massachusetts\r\nBay, Dunning protested so vehemently. At least one instance of its\r\nemployment is to be found here, when in 1765, in Maryland, Sarah\r\nSoaper appealed a negro slave named Tom for the murder of her husband.\r\nThe negro, however, was probably not aware of his privilege to demand\r\nthe wager of battle, so he submitted to be tried by a jury, and was\r\nduly condemned and executed.[816] John C. Gray, Jr., Esq., of Boston,\r\nto whom I am indebted for calling my attention to this and some other\r\nsources of information on the subject, informs me of a tradition\r\nthat a disputed question of boundary between two townships in New\r\nHampshire was once settled by combat between champions; but the most\r\nconservative State in this respect appears to be South Carolina. An act\r\nof that colony, in 1712, enumerating the English laws to be held in\r\nforce, specifically includes those concerning appeal of death, and Dr.\r\nCooper, in his “Statutes at Large of South Carolina,” writing in 1837,\r\nseems to think that both the wager of battle and appeal of death were\r\nstill legally in force there at that time.[817] So Chancellor Kilty,\r\nin his Report on English Statutes applicable to Maryland, made in\r\n1811, apparently considers that the appeal of death was still legally\r\nexistent, but regards it as unimportant in view of the pardoning power\r\nand other considerations.[818]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n                              THE ORDEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL INVOCATION OF THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the wager of battle and the other ordeals have much in common,\r\nthere is sufficient distinction between them to render convenient\r\ntheir separate consideration, even at the risk of a little occasional\r\nrepetition. The development and career of these forms of the judgment\r\nof God were not in all respects similar, nor was their employment\r\nin all cases the same. The mere fact that the duel was necessarily\r\na bilateral ordeal, to which both sides had to submit, in itself\r\nestablishes a limit as to the cases fitted for its employment, nor\r\nwere all races of mankind adapted by character for its use. Moreover,\r\nin its origin it was simply a device for regulating under conditions\r\nof comparative fairness the primitive law of force, and the conception\r\nof the intervention of a Divine Power, whereby victory would enure to\r\nthe right, probably was a belief subsequently engrafted on it. In the\r\nother ordeals this is the fundamental idea on which they were based,\r\nand we may perhaps assume that they represent a later development in\r\nhuman progress, in which brute strength has declined somewhat from its\r\nearliest savage supremacy, and a reliance upon the interposition of a\r\nsuperhuman agency, whether the spirit of a fetish or an omnipotent and\r\njust Godhead, single or multiform, has grown sufficiently strong to be\r\na controlling principle in the guidance of daily life.\r\n\r\nYet this, too, is only a step in the evolution of human thought, before\r\nit can grasp the conception of an Omnipotence that shall work out its\r\ndestined ends, and yet allow its mortal creatures free scope to mould\r\ntheir own fragmentary portions of the great whole—a Power so infinitely\r\ngreat that its goodness, mercy, and justice are compatible with the\r\nexistence of evil in the world which it has formed, so that man has\r\nfull liberty to obey the dictates of his baser passions, without being\r\nreleased from responsibility, and, at the same time, without disturbing\r\nthe preordained results of Divine wisdom and beneficence. Accordingly,\r\nwe find in the religious history of almost all races that a belief\r\nin a Divine Being is accompanied with the expectation that special\r\nmanifestations of power will be made on all occasions, and that the\r\ninterposition of Providence may be had for the asking, whenever man,\r\nin the pride of his littleness, condescends to waive his own judgment,\r\nand undertakes to test the inscrutable ways of his Creator by the\r\ntouchstone of his own limited reason. Thus miracles come to be expected\r\nas matters of every-day occurrence, and the laws of nature are to be\r\nsuspended whenever man chooses to tempt his God with the promise of\r\nright and the threat of injustice to be committed in His name.\r\n\r\nTo this tendency of the human mind is attributable the almost universal\r\nadoption of the so-called Judgment of God, by which men, oppressed\r\nwith doubt, have essayed in all ages to relieve themselves from\r\nresponsibility by calling in the assistance of Heaven. Nor, in so\r\ndoing, have they seemed to appreciate the self-exaltation implied in\r\nthe act itself, but in all humility have cast themselves and their\r\nsorrows at the feet of the Great Judge, making a merit of abnegating\r\nthe reason which, however limited, has been bestowed to be used and\r\nnot rejected. In the Carlovingian Capitularies there occurs a passage,\r\ndictated doubtless by the spirit of genuine trust in God, which well\r\nexpresses the pious sentiments presiding over acts of the grossest\r\npractical impiety. “Let doubtful cases be determined by the judgment\r\nof God. The judges may decide that which they clearly know, but that\r\nwhich they cannot know shall be reserved for Divine judgment. Whom God\r\nhath kept for his own judgment may not be condemned by human means.\r\n‘Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who\r\nboth will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make\r\nmanifest the counsels of the hearts’”[819] (_1 Cor._ iv. 5). That\r\nHeaven would interpose to save the guiltless was taught in too many\r\nways to admit of doubt. An innocent man, we are told, was accused of a\r\nmurder and pursued till he took refuge in the cell of St. Macarius, who\r\nat once proposed to determine the question of his guilt by an appeal to\r\nGod. Adjourning to the grave of the slain the saint addressed a prayer\r\nto Christ and then called upon the dead man to declare whether the\r\naccused had killed him. A voice from the tomb responded in the negative\r\nand the fugitive was released; but when the saint was asked to pursue\r\nthe investigation and ascertain the name of the murderer, he replied\r\nthat this was none of his duty, for the sinner might already have\r\nrepented.[820]\r\n\r\nThe superstition which we here find dignified with the forms of\r\nChristian faith manifests itself among so many races and under such\r\ndiverse stages of civilization that it may be regarded as an inevitable\r\nincident in human evolution, only to be outgrown at the latest periods\r\nof development. In this, however, as in so many other particulars,\r\nChina furnishes virtually an exception. Her arrested thought exhibits\r\nitself, in the King or sacred books collected by Confucius five hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era, in nearly the same form as is found\r\nin the orthodox opinion of to-day. In this, religious belief is but a\r\nsystem of cold morality, which avoids the virtues as well as the errors\r\nof more imaginative faiths. In the most revered and authoritative\r\nof the Chinese Scriptures, the Shu-King, or Holy Book, we find a\r\ntheo-philosophy based on a Supreme Power, _Tai-Ki_, or Heaven, which\r\nis pure reason, or the embodiment of the laws and forces of nature\r\nacting under the pressure of blind destiny. It is true that some\r\nforms of divination were practised, and even enjoined, but no fuller\r\nexpression of belief in direct interposition from above is to be found\r\nthan that contained in the saying attributed to Muh-Wang (about 1000\r\nB. C.) in his instructions to his judges in criminal cases: “Say not\r\nthat Heaven is unjust; it is man who brings these evils on himself. If\r\nit were not that Heaven inflicts these severe punishments the world\r\nwould be ungoverned.”[821] It is, therefore, in strict compliance with\r\nthis philosophy that in the modern jurisprudence of China there is\r\nno allusion to any evidence save that of facts duly substantiated by\r\nwitnesses, and even oaths are neither required nor admitted in judicial\r\nproceedings.[822]\r\n\r\nThese teachings, however, are too refined and sublimated for ordinary\r\nhuman nature, and along-side of official Confucianism, Taoism and\r\nBuddhism flourish with a wealth of legends and marvels that may fairly\r\nrival the most exuberant fancies of Teutonic or Latin mediævalism. In\r\nthe popular mind, therefore, the divine interposition may perpetually\r\nbe expected to vindicate innocence and to punish crime, and moral\r\nteaching to a great extent consists of histories illustrating this\r\nbelief in all its phases and in every possible contingency of\r\ncommon-place life. Thus it is related that in A. D. 1626 the learned\r\nDoctor Wang-i had two servants, one stupid and the other cunning. The\r\nlatter stole from his master a sum of money, and caused the blame to\r\nfall upon his comrade, who was unable to justify himself. By way of\r\nsecuring him, he was tied to a flagstaff, and his accuser was set to\r\nwatch him through the night. At midnight the flagstaff broke in twain\r\nwith a loud noise, the upper portion falling upon the guilty man and\r\nkilling him, while the innocent was left unhurt; and next morning,\r\nwhen the effects of the dead man were examined, the stolen money was\r\nfound among them, thus completely establishing the innocence of his\r\nintended victim.[823] Popular beliefs such as these naturally find\r\ntheir expression in irregular judicial proceedings, in spite of the\r\nstrict materialism of the written law, and, at least in some parts of\r\nChina, a curious form of the ordeal of chance is employed in default\r\nof testimony. If an injured husband surprises his wife _flagrante\r\ndelicto_ he is at liberty to slay the adulterous pair on the spot;\r\nbut he must then cut off their heads and carry them to the nearest\r\nmagistrate, before whom it is incumbent on him to prove his innocence\r\nand demonstrate the truth of his story. As external evidence is not\r\noften to be had in such cases, the usual mode of trial is to place the\r\nheads in a large tub of water, which is violently stirred. The heads,\r\nin revolving, naturally come together in the centre, when, if they meet\r\nback to back, the victims are pronounced guiltless, and the husband is\r\npunished as a murderer; but if they meet face to face, the truth of\r\nhis statement is accepted as demonstrated, he is gently bastinadoed to\r\nteach him that wives should be more closely watched, and is presented\r\nwith a small sum of money wherewith to purchase another spouse.[824]\r\n\r\nThe cognate civilization of Japan yields even more readily to the\r\ntemptation of seeking from the Deity a solution of doubt. Anciently\r\nthere were in general use the judgments of God, so well known in\r\nmediæval Europe, of the wager of battle and the ordeal of boiling\r\nwater, and the latter is still customarily employed among the Ainos, or\r\naborigines. Even yet two antagonists may be seen to plunge their hands\r\nin scalding water, the one who suffers the most being convicted, while\r\nthe innocent is expected to escape with injuries so slight that they\r\nwill readily heal.[825]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning to the still savage races of the old world we everywhere find\r\nthese superstitions in full force. Africa furnishes an ample store of\r\nthem, varying from the crudest simplicity to the most deadly devices.\r\nAmong the Kalabarese the _afia-edet-ibom_ is administered with the\r\ncurved fang of a snake, which is dexterously inserted under the lid\r\nand around the ball of the eye of the accused; if innocent, he is\r\nexpected to eject it by rolling the eye, while, if unable to do so, it\r\nis removed with a leopard’s tooth, and he is condemned. Even ruder, and\r\nmore under the control of the operator, is the _afia-ibnot-idiok_, in\r\nwhich a white and a black line are drawn on the skull of a chimpanzee:\r\nthis is held up before the defendant, when an apparent attraction\r\nof the white line towards him demonstrates his innocence, or an\r\ninclination of the black line in his direction pronounces his guilt.\r\nMore formidable than these is the ordeal-nut, containing a deadly\r\npoison which causes frothing at the mouth, convulsions, paralysis, and\r\nspeedy death. In capital cases, or even when sickness is attributed\r\nto hostile machinations, the _abiadiong_, or sorcerer, decides who\r\nshall undergo the trial; and as the active principle of the nut can be\r\nextracted by preliminary boiling, judicious liberality on the part of\r\nthe individual selected is supposed to render the ordeal comparatively\r\nharmless.[826]\r\n\r\nThroughout a wide region of Western Africa, one of the most popular\r\nforms of ordeal is that of the red water, or “sassy-bark.” In the\r\nneighborhood of Sierra-Leone, as described by Dr. Winterbottom, it\r\nis administered by requiring the accused to fast for twelve hours,\r\nand then to swallow a small quantity of rice. After this the infusion\r\nof the bark is taken in large quantities, as much as a gallon being\r\nsometimes employed; if it produces emesia, so as to eject all of the\r\nrice, the proof of innocence is complete, but if it fails in this,\r\nor if it acts as a purgative, the accused is pronounced guilty. It\r\nhas narcotic properties, also, a manifestation of which is likewise\r\ndecisive against the sufferer. Among some of the tribes this is\r\ndetermined by placing on the ground small sticks about eighteen inches\r\napart, or by forming an archway of limbs of trees bent to the ground,\r\nand requiring the patient to pick his way among them, a feat rendered\r\ndifficult by the vertiginous effects of the poison. Although death not\r\ninfrequently results from the ordeal itself, yet the faith reposed in\r\nthese trials is so absolute that, according to Dr. Livingston, they\r\nare demanded with eagerness by those accused of witchcraft, confident\r\nin their own innocence and believing that the guilty alone can suffer.\r\nWhen the red water is administered for its emetic effects, the popular\r\nexplanation is that the fetish enters with the draught, examines the\r\nheart of the accused, and, on finding him innocent, returns with the\r\nrice as evidence.[827] A system directly the reverse of all this is\r\nfound in Ashantee, where sickness in the ordeal is a sign of innocence,\r\nand the _lex talionis_ is strictly observed. When evidence is\r\ninsufficient to support a charge, the accuser is made to take an oath\r\nas to the truth of his accusation, and the defendant is then required\r\nto chew a piece of _odum_ wood and drink a pitcher of water. If no\r\nill effects ensue, he is deemed guilty, and is put to death; while\r\nif he becomes sick, he is acquitted and the accuser suffers in his\r\nstead.[828]\r\n\r\nFurther to the east in the African continent, the Niam-Niam and the\r\nneighboring tribes illustrate the endless variety of form of which\r\nthe ordeal is susceptible. These savages resort to various kinds of\r\ndivination which are equally employed as a guidance for the future\r\nin all important undertakings, and as means to discover the guilt or\r\nthe innocence of those accused of crime. The principal of these is\r\nthe _borru_, in which two polished pieces of damma wood are rubbed\r\ntogether, after being moistened with a few drops of water. If they\r\nglide easily on each other the sign is favorable; if they adhere\r\ntogether it is unfavorable. Life and death are also brought in play,\r\nbut vicarious victims are made the subject of experiment. Thus a\r\ncock is taken and its head is repeatedly immersed in water until the\r\ncreature is rigid and insensible; if it recovers, the indication is\r\nfavorable, if it dies, adverse. Or an oil extracted from the bengye\r\nwood is administered to a hen, and the same conclusions are drawn from\r\nits survival or death.[829]\r\n\r\nThe Somali of Ethiopia employ the ordeals of red-hot iron and boiling\r\nwater or oil in virtually the same form as we shall see them used in\r\nIndia and Europe, examining the hand of the accused after twenty-four\r\nhours to determine his guilt from its condition.[830]\r\n\r\nIn Madagascar the poison ordeal is customarily administered, with a\r\ndecoction of the deadly nut of the Tangena (_Tanghinia venenifera_).\r\nOne of the modes of its application is evidently based on the same\r\ntheory as the ordeal of red water and rice, to which it bears a notable\r\nresemblance. A fowl is boiled, and three pieces of its skin are placed\r\nin the broth. Then a cupful of the decoction of the Tangena nut is\r\ngiven to the accused, followed by the same quantity of the broth, with\r\nthe pieces of skin. Unless the poison speedily causes vomiting, it\r\nsoon kills the patient, which is a satisfactory proof of his guilt.\r\nIf vomiting ensues, it is kept up by repeated doses of the broth\r\nand warm water, and if the bits of skin are ejected the accused is\r\ndeclared innocent; but if they are retained he is deemed convicted\r\nand is summarily despatched with another bowl of the poison. In the\r\npersecutions of 1836 and 1849 directed against the Malagasy Christians,\r\nmany of the converts were tried with the Tangena nut, and numbers of\r\nthem perished.[831] The ordeals of red-hot iron and boiling water are\r\nalso used.[832]\r\n\r\nSpringing from the same belief is the process used in Tahiti for\r\ndiscovering the criminal in cases of theft. The priest, when applied\r\nto, digs a hole in the clay floor of his hut, fills it with water, and\r\nstands over it with a young plantain in his hand, while invoking his\r\ngod. The deity thereupon conducts the spirit of the thief over the\r\nwater, and his reflection is recognized by the priest.[833]\r\n\r\nThe races of the Indian archipelago are fully equipped with resources\r\nof the same kind for settling doubtful cases. Among the Dyaks of Borneo\r\nquestions for which no other solution is apparent are settled by giving\r\nto each litigant a lump of salt, which they drop simultaneously into\r\nwater, and he whose lump dissolves soonest is adjudged the loser; or\r\neach takes a living shell and places it on a plate, when lime-juice\r\nis squeezed over them, and the one whose shell first moves under this\r\ngentle stimulant is declared the winner.[834]\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines there are various peculiar ordeals in use. A needle\r\nis sometimes thrust into the scalp of two antagonists, and he from whom\r\nthe blood flows most profusely is adjudged the loser; or two chickens\r\nare roasted to death and then opened, and the owner of the one which is\r\nfound to have the largest liver is defeated.[835]\r\n\r\nThe black Australioid Khonds of the hill districts of Orissa confirm\r\nthe universality of these practices by customs peculiar to themselves\r\nwhich may be assumed as handed down by tradition from prehistoric\r\ntimes. Not only do they constantly employ the ordeals of boiling water\r\nand oil and red-hot iron, which they may have borrowed from their\r\nHindu neighbors, but they administer judicial oaths with imprecations\r\nthat are decidedly of the character of ordeals. Thus an oath is\r\ntaken on a tiger’s skin with an invocation of destruction from that\r\nanimal upon the perjured; or upon a lizard’s skin whose scaliness is\r\ninvited upon him who may forswear himself; or over an ant-hill with\r\nan imprecation that he who swears falsely may be reduced to powder. A\r\nmore characteristic ordeal is that used in litigation concerning land,\r\nwhen a portion of earth from the disputed possession is swallowed by\r\neach claimant in the belief that it will destroy him whose pretensions\r\nare false. On very solemn occasions a sheep is killed in the name of\r\nTari Pennu, the dreadful earth-goddess: rice is then moistened with its\r\nblood, and this is administered, in the full conviction that she will\r\nslay the rash litigant who insults her power by perjury.[836]\r\n\r\nThe hill-tribes of Rajmahal, who represent another of the pre-Aryan\r\nIndian races, furnish us with further developments of the same\r\nprinciple, in details bearing a marked analogy to those practised by\r\nthe most diverse families of mankind. Thus the process by which the\r\nguilt of Achan was discovered (_Joshua_ vii. 16-18), and that by which,\r\nas we shall see hereafter, Master Anselm proposed to identify the thief\r\nof the sacred vessels of Laon, are not unlike the ceremony used when a\r\ndistrict is ravaged by tigers or by pestilence, which is regarded as a\r\nretribution for sin committed by some inhabitant, whose identification\r\nthus becomes all-important for the salvation of the rest. In the\r\nprocess known as _Satane_ a person sits on the ground with a branch of\r\nthe bale tree planted opposite to him; rice is handed to him to eat in\r\nthe name of each village of the district, and when the one is named in\r\nwhich the culprit lives, he is expected to throw up the rice. Having\r\nthus determined the village, the same plan is adopted with respect to\r\neach family in it, and when the family is identified, the individual\r\nis discovered in the same manner. Another form, named _Cherreen_, is\r\nnot unlike the ordeal of the Bible and key, not as yet obsolete among\r\nChristians. A stone is suspended by a string, and the names of the\r\nvillages, families, and individuals are repeated, when it indicates the\r\nguilty by its vibrations. Thieves are also discovered and convicted by\r\nthese processes, and by another mode known as _Gobereen_, which is a\r\nmodification of the hot-water ordeal. A mixture of cow-dung, oil, and\r\nwater is made to boil briskly in a pot. A ring is thrown in, and each\r\nsuspected person, after invoking the Supreme Deity, is required to find\r\nand bring out the ring with his hand—the belief being that the innocent\r\nwill not be burned, while the guilty will not be able to put his hand\r\ninto the pot, as the mixture will rise up to meet it.[837]\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Aztecs the oath assumed the proportions of an ordeal;\r\nthe accused in taking it touched with his finger first the ground\r\nand then his tongue, and a perjury thus committed was expected to be\r\nfollowed with speedy misfortune. So among the Ostiaks and Samoiedes a\r\ndisculpatory oath with imprecations taken on the head of a bear is held\r\nto have the same virtue.[838]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReverting to the older races, we find no trace of formal ordeals in the\r\nfragmentary remains out of which Egyptologists thus far have succeeded\r\nin reconstructing the antique civilization of the Nile valley, but this\r\nis not attributable to an intellectual development which had cast them\r\naside as worthless. The intimate dependence of man on the gods, and\r\nthe daily interposition of the latter in human affairs, were taught by\r\nthe prophets of the temples and reverently accepted by the people. It\r\nwas merely a question as to the manner in which the judgment of God\r\nwas to be obtained, and this apparently took the form of reference to\r\nthe oracles which abounded in every Egyptian nome. In this we are not\r\nleft to mere conjecture, for a story related by Herodotus shows that\r\nsuch an interpellation of the divine power was habitual in prosecutions\r\nwhen evidence of guilt was deficient. Aames II., before he gained\r\nthe crown, was noted for his reckless and dissolute life, and was\r\nfrequently accused of theft and carried to the nearest oracle, when\r\nhe was convicted or acquitted according to the response. On ascending\r\nthe throne, he paid great respect to the shrines where he had been\r\ncondemned, and neglected altogether those where he had been absolved,\r\nsaying that the former gave true and the latter lying responses.[839]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Semitic races, while not giving to the ordeal the development\r\nwhich it has received among the Aryans, still afford sufficient\r\nmanifestation of its existence among them. Chaldean and Assyrian\r\ninstitutions have not as yet been sufficiently explored for us to state\r\nwith positiveness whether or not the judgment of God was a recognized\r\nresource of the puzzled dispenser of justice; but the probabilities\r\nare strongly in favor of some processes of the kind being discovered\r\nwhen we are more fully acquainted with their judicial system. The\r\nconstant invocation of the gods, which forms so marked a feature of\r\nthe cuneiform inscriptions, indicates a belief in the divine guidance\r\nof human affairs which could hardly fail to find expression in direct\r\nappeals for light in the administration of justice. The nearest\r\napproach however to the principle of the ordeal which has thus far\r\nbeen deciphered is found in the imprecations commonly expressed in\r\ncontracts, donations, and deeds, by which the gods are invoked to shed\r\nall the curses that can assail humanity on the heads of those who shall\r\nevade the execution of their plighted faith, or seek to present false\r\nclaims. Akin to this, moreover, was the penalty frequently expressed\r\nin contracts whereby their violation was to be punished by heavy\r\nfines, the greater part of which was payable into the treasury of some\r\ntemple.[840]\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews, as a rule, the interposition of Yahveh was expected\r\ndirectly, without the formulas which human ingenuity has invented to\r\ninvite and ascertain the decisions of the divine will. Still, the\r\ncombat of David and Goliath has been cited as a model and justification\r\nof the judicial duel; and there are some practices described in\r\nScripture which are strictly ordeals, and which were duly put forth by\r\nthe local clergy throughout Europe when struggling to defend the system\r\nagainst the prohibitions of the papacy. When the man who blasphemed\r\nthe Lord (_Levit._ xxiv. 11-16) was kept in ward “that the mind of\r\nthe Lord might be showed them,” and the Lord ordered Moses to have\r\nhim stoned by the whole congregation, we are not told the exact means\r\nadopted to ascertain the will of Yahveh, but the appeal was identical\r\nin principle with that which prompted the mediæval judgment of God.\r\nThe use of the lot, moreover, which was so constantly employed in the\r\nmost important and sacred matters, was not a mere appeal to chance,\r\nbut was a sacred ceremony performed “before the Lord at the door of\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation” to learn what was the decision\r\nof Yahveh.[841] The lot was also used, if not as a regular judicial\r\nexpedient, at all events in unusual cases as a mode of discovering\r\ncriminals, and its results were held to be the undoubted revelation of\r\nOmniscience. It is more than probable that the Urim and Thummin were\r\nlots, and that they were not infrequently used, as in the cases of\r\nAchan and Jonathan.[842] And the popular belief in the efficacy of the\r\nlot is manifested in the account of Jonah’s adventure (_Jonah_ i. 7)\r\nwhen the sailors are described as casting lots to discover the sinner\r\nwhose presence brought the tempest upon them. The most formal and\r\nabsolute example of the ordeal, however, was the Bitter Water by which\r\nconjugal infidelity was convicted and punished (_Numb._ v. 11-31). This\r\ncurious and elaborate ceremony, which bears so marked an analogy to the\r\npoison ordeals, was abandoned by order of R. Johanan ben Saccai about\r\nthe time of the Christian era, and is too well known to require more\r\nthan a passing allusion to the wealth of Haggadistic legend and the\r\ninterminable controversies and speculations to which it has given rise.\r\nI may add, however, that Aben Ezra and other Jewish commentators hold\r\nthat when Moses burnt the golden calf and made the Israelites drink the\r\nwater in which its ashes were cast (_Exod._ xxxii. 20), he administered\r\nan ordeal, like that of the Bitter Water, which in some way revealed\r\nthose who had been guilty of idolatry, so that the Levites could slay\r\nthem; and Selden explains this by reference to a tradition, according\r\nto which the gold of the calf reddened the beards of those who had\r\nworshipped it, and thus rendered them conspicuous.[843]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Mahomet were too directly derived from the later\r\nJudaism for him to admit into his jurisprudence any formal system\r\ndepending on miracles to establish justice between man and man whenever\r\nAllah might be invoked to manifest his power. Like the Jews, however,\r\nhe taught that the constant supervision of the divine power is\r\nspontaneously exerted, and he carried this so far as to inculcate the\r\nbelief that a judge pure from self-seeking would be inspired constantly\r\nfrom above. “He who asks to be made judge will not be assisted; and he\r\nwho is made judge by compulsion, God sends down to him an angel, who\r\ncauses his actions and sentences to be just.” To one who hesitated to\r\naccept the office, the Prophet said, “God will direct your heart, and\r\nshow you judicial ways, and fix your tongue in truth and justice.” On\r\nthe other hand, when a judge is unjust, “he separates from himself\r\nthe assistance and favor of God, and the devil is always with him.”\r\nIt was hard on litigants when the tribunal might be presided over\r\nby either Allah or Eblis, but they had no recourse, except in the\r\noath, which was the corner-stone of Mahomet’s judicial system. In the\r\nabsence of evidence, the oath of the defendant was final, and this\r\nincitement to perjury could only be repressed by investing the oath\r\nwith the qualities of the ordeal. Accordingly he lost no opportunity\r\nof insisting upon the punishment, here and hereafter, of those who\r\nperjured themselves before the judgment-seat. Sometimes this failed\r\nto deter an eager pleader, and then he consoled the defeated party\r\nwith the assurance that his successful adversary would suffer in the\r\nend, as when the chief of the Cindah tribe urged that a Jew, against\r\nwhom he brought suit for land unjustly held, would swear falsely, and\r\nthe Prophet rejoined, “Swearing is lawful, but he who takes a false\r\noath will have no luck in futurity.” Tradition relates, however, that\r\nfrequently he succeeded thus in frightening those who were ready to\r\nforswear themselves, as when a man of Hadramut claimed land occupied\r\nby a Cindah, and, being without evidence, the defendant was ready to\r\ntake the oath, when Mahomet interposed, “No one takes the property\r\nof another by oath but will meet God with his tongue cut off,” and\r\nthe Cindah feared God and said, “The land is his.” In another case,\r\nwhen two men were quarrelling over an inheritance, and neither had a\r\nwitness, he warned them, “In whose favor soever I may order a thing\r\nwhich is not his right, then I lay apart for him nothing less than a\r\npiece of hell-fire,” whereupon each litigant exclaimed, “O messenger of\r\nGod, I give up my right to him.” Sometimes, however, even Mahomet had\r\nrecourse to a more direct invocation of the supreme power, as in a case\r\nwherein two men disputed as to the ownership of an animal, and neither\r\nhad witnesses, when he directed them to cast lots upon oath.[844]\r\n\r\nThese cases do not bear out the tradition that, when the Prophet was\r\nperplexed beyond his ability, he had the resource of appealing to the\r\nangel Gabriel for enlightenment. There is one legend respecting him,\r\nhowever, which manifests the popular belief that in doubtful cases God\r\nmay be relied on to interpose for the vindication of innocence. A youth\r\nbrought before Mahomet on an accusation of murder, protested that the\r\nact was committed in self-defence. The Prophet ordered the corpse to be\r\nentombed, and postponed the trial until the next day. The brethren of\r\nthe slain, still insisting on vengeance, were then told that they might\r\ninflict upon the murderer precisely the same wounds as those which\r\nthey should find on the body. On opening the sepulchre for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining the exact measure of the punishment conceded, they\r\nreturned affrighted to the judgment-seat, and reported that they had\r\nfound nothing but the smoke and stench of Gehenna; whereupon Mahomet\r\npronounced that Eblis had carried off the corpse of the guilty, and\r\nthat the accused was innocent.[845] The prevalence of superstitions\r\nkindred to this, in spite of the principles laid down in the law,\r\nis shown by the custom which exists among some tribes of Arabs, of\r\nemploying the ordeal of red-hot iron in the shape of a gigantic spoon,\r\nto which, when duly heated, the accused applies his tongue, his\r\nguilt or innocence being manifested by his suffering, or escaping\r\ninjury.[846] A species of vulgar divination, common among the Turks,\r\nmoreover, belongs to the same category of thought, as it is used in the\r\ndetection of thieves by observing the marks on wax slowly melted, while\r\ncertain magic formulas are recited over it.[847]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is among the Aryan races that we are to look for the fullest and\r\nmost enduring evidences of the beliefs which developed into the ordeal,\r\nand gave it currency from the rudest stages of nomadic existence to\r\nperiods of polished and enlightened civilization. In the perfect\r\ndualism of Mazdeism, the Yazatas, or angels of the good creation, were\r\nalways prompt to help the pure and innocent against the machinations\r\nof Ahriman and his Daevas, their power to do so depending only upon\r\nthe righteousness of him who needed assistance.[848] The man unjustly\r\naccused, or seeking to obtain or defend his right, could therefore\r\nsafely trust that any trial to which he might be subjected would be\r\nharmless, however much the ordinary course of nature would have to\r\nbe turned aside in order to save him. Thus Zoroaster could readily\r\nexplain and maintain the ancestral practices, the common use of which\r\nby both the Zend and the Hindu branches of the Aryan family points\r\nto their origin at a period anterior to the separation between the\r\nkindred tribes. In the fragments of the Avesta, which embody what\r\nremains to us of the prehistoric law of the ancient Persians, we find a\r\nreference to the ordeal of boiling water, showing it to be an accepted\r\nlegal process, with a definite penalty affixed for him who failed to\r\nexculpate himself in it:—\r\n\r\n “Creator! he who knowingly approaches the hot, golden, boiling water,\r\n as if speaking truth, but lying to Mithra;\r\n\r\n “What is the punishment for it?\r\n\r\n “Then answered Ahura-Mazda: Let them strike seven hundred blows with\r\n the horse-goad, seven hundred with the craosho-charana!”[849]\r\n\r\nThe fire ordeal is also seen in the legend which relates how Sudabeh,\r\nthe favorite wife of Kai Kaoos, became enamored of his son Siawush, and\r\non his rejecting her advances accused him to his father of endeavoring\r\nto seduce her. Kai Kaoos sent out a hundred caravans of dromedaries\r\nto gather wood, of which two immense piles were built separated by a\r\npassage barely admitting a horseman. These were soaked with naphtha and\r\nfired in a hundred places, when Siawush mounted on a charger, after an\r\ninvocation to God, rode through the flames and emerged without even\r\na discoloration of his garments. Sudabeh was sentenced to death, but\r\npardoned on the intercession of Siawush.[850] Another reminiscence of\r\nthe same ordeal may be traced among the crowd of fantastic legends with\r\nwhich the career of Zoroaster is embroidered. It is related that when\r\nan infant he was seized by the magicians, who foresaw their future\r\ndestruction at his hands, and was thrown upon a huge pile composed of\r\nwood, naphtha, and sulphur, which was forthwith kindled; but, through\r\nthe interposition of Hormazd, “the devouring flame became as water, in\r\nthe midst of which slumbered the pearl of Zardusht.”[851]\r\n\r\nIn Pehlvi the judicial ordeal was known as _var nirang_, and\r\nthirty-three doubtful conjunctures are enumerated as requiring its\r\nemployment. The ordinary form was the pouring of molten metal on the\r\nbody of the patient, though sometimes the heated substance was applied\r\nto the tongue or the feet.[852] Of the former, a celebrated instance,\r\ncuriously anticipating the story told, as we shall see hereafter, of\r\nBishop Poppo when he converted the Danes, is related as a leading\r\nincident in the reformation of the Mazdiasni religion when the Persian\r\nmonarchy was reconstructed by the Sassanids. Eighty thousand heretics\r\nremained obstinate until Sapor I. was so urgent with his Magi to\r\nprocure their conversion that the Dustoor Adurabad offered to prove the\r\ntruth of orthodoxy by suffering eighteen pounds of melted copper to be\r\npoured over his naked shoulders if the dissenters would agree to yield\r\ntheir convictions in case he escaped unhurt. The bargain was agreed to,\r\nand carried out with the happiest results. Not a hair of the Dustoor’s\r\nbody was singed by the rivulets of fiery metal, and the recusants were\r\ngathered into the fold.[853]\r\n\r\nAmong the Hindu Aryans so thoroughly was the divine interposition\r\nexpected in the affairs of daily life that, according to the Manava\r\nDharma Sastra, if a witness, within a week after giving testimony,\r\nshould suffer from sickness, or undergo loss by fire, or the death of\r\na relation, it was held to be a manifestation of the divine wrath,\r\ndrawn down upon him in punishment for perjured testimony.[854] There\r\nwas, therefore, no inducement to abandon the resource of the ordeal, of\r\nwhich traces may be found as far back as the Vedic period, in the forms\r\nboth of fire and red-hot iron.[855] In the Ramayana, when Rama, the\r\nincarnate Vishnu, distrusts the purity of his beloved Sita, whom he has\r\nrescued from the Rakshasha Ravana, she vindicates herself by mounting a\r\nblazing pyre, from which she is rescued unhurt by the fire-god, Agni,\r\nhimself.[856] Manu declares, in the most absolute fashion—\r\n\r\n “Let the judge cause him who is under trial to take fire in his\r\n hand, or to plunge in water, or to touch separately the heads of his\r\n children and of his wife.\r\n\r\n “Whom the flame burneth not, whom the water rejects not from its\r\n depths, whom misfortune overtakes not speedily, his oath shall be\r\n received as undoubted.\r\n\r\n “When the Rishi Vatsa was accused by his young half-brother, who\r\n stigmatized him as the son of a Sudra, he swore that it was false,\r\n and, passing through fire, proved the truth of his oath; the fire,\r\n which attests the guilt and the innocence of all men, harmed not a\r\n hair of his head, for he spake the truth.”\r\n\r\nAnd the practical application of the rule is seen in the injunction on\r\nboth plaintiff and defendant to undergo the ordeal, even in certain\r\ncivil cases.[857]\r\n\r\nIn the more developed code of Vishnu we find the ordeal system\r\nexceedingly complicated, pervading every branch of jurisprudence and\r\nonly limited by the amount at stake or the character or caste of the\r\ndefendant.[858] Yet Hindu antiquity is so remote and there have been\r\nso many schools of teachers that the custom apparently did not prevail\r\nin all times and places. One of the most ancient books of law is the\r\nDharmasastra of Gautama, who says nothing of ordeals and relies for\r\nproof wholly on the evidence of witnesses, adding the very relaxed rule\r\nthat “No guilt is incurred in giving false evidence in case the life of\r\na man depends thereon.”[859]\r\n\r\nThis, however, is exceptional, and the ordeal maintained its existence\r\nfrom the most ancient periods to modern times. Under the name of\r\n_purrikeh_, or _parikyah_, it is prescribed in the native Hindu law\r\nin all cases, civil and criminal, which cannot be determined by\r\nwritten or oral evidence, or by oath, and is sometimes incumbent upon\r\nthe plaintiff and sometimes upon the defendant. In its various forms\r\nit bears so marked a resemblance to the judgments of God current in\r\nmediæval Europe that the further consideration of its use in India may\r\nbe more conveniently deferred till we come to discuss its varieties in\r\ndetail, except to add that in Hindu, as in Christian courts, it has\r\nalways been a religious as well as a judicial ceremony, conducted in\r\nthe presence of Brahmans, and with the use of invocations to the higher\r\npowers.[860]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuddhism naturally followed the legal institutions which it found\r\nestablished, and accepted the ordeal, though it could scarce form a\r\nlogical incident in the great system of transmigration whereby the good\r\nand evil of the universe distributed itself automatically, without\r\nsupervision from the thirty-two heavens. We have seen the influence\r\nwhich Buddhism exercised on Chinese materialism, and Tibetan Shamanism\r\ncould hardly expect to escape it. Thus in Tibet we find the hot water\r\nordeal assume a form which is literally even-handed, and which, if\r\ngenerally enforced, must exert a happily repressive influence over\r\nlitigation. Both plaintiff and defendant thrust their arms into a\r\ncaldron of boiling water containing a black and a white stone, the\r\nverdict being in favor of him who brings up the white.[861]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic tribes had already, in prehistoric times, reached a point\r\nof mental development superior to the grosser forms of the ordeal as a\r\nrecognized instrument of judicial investigation. These were replaced,\r\nas we have seen in Egypt, by habitual resort to oracles, but that some\r\nrecollection of the ancestral practices was handed down to later ages\r\nis shown by the allusions in the Antigone of Sophocles, when the guards\r\nprotest to Creon their innocence as to the burial of Polynices, and\r\noffer to prove it by the ordeal:—\r\n\r\n    “Ready with hands to bear the red-hot iron,\r\n    To pass through fire, and by the gods to swear\r\n    That we nor did the deed, nor do we know\r\n    Who counselled it, or who performed it” (264-267).\r\n\r\nAnd a remnant of the primæval customs was preserved in the solemnities\r\nunder which litigation was sometimes determined by one of the parties\r\ntaking an oath on the heads of his children, or with curses on himself\r\nand his family, or passing through fire.[862] The poison ordeal, also,\r\nwas not wholly obsolete. The Gæum or temple of the broad-breasted\r\nEarth, Gæa Eurysternus, at Ægæ in Achaia, was served by a priestess\r\nwho, though not necessarily a virgin, was yet required to preserve\r\nstrict celibacy when once invested with her sacred functions. If\r\nany doubts arose as to her virtue, it was tested with a draught of\r\nbull’s blood, which speedily wrought her punishment if she was guilty.\r\nThe same temple also furnished an illustration of ascertaining the\r\ndivine will by means of the lot, for when a vacancy occurred in the\r\npriestship, and there were several applicants, the choice between them\r\nwas determined by a reference to chance.[863]\r\n\r\nEven these traces of the ancient customs of the race disappear among\r\nthe Latins, though they preserved in full force the habits of thought\r\nfrom which the ordeal took its rise. This is seen in the most solemn\r\nform of imprecation known to the Romans as lending irrevocable force\r\nto promissory oaths—the “Jovem lapidem jurare,”—whether we take the\r\nceremony mentioned by Festus, of casting a stone from the hand while\r\nadjuring Jupiter to reject in like manner the swearer if he should\r\nprove forsworn, or the form described by Livy as preceding the combat\r\nbetween the Horatii and Curiatii, in which a victim was knocked on\r\nthe head with a stone under a somewhat similar invocation.[864] Even\r\nwithout this ceremony, imprecatory oaths were used which were based\r\non the belief that the gods would take men at their word and punish\r\nthem, for forswearing themselves, with the evils which they thus\r\ninvoked. Thus, after the battle of Cannæ, P. Cornelius Scipio forced\r\nthe nobles who were plotting to leave Italy to abandon their design\r\nand take an oath in which they adjured Jupiter to visit them and all\r\nbelonging to them with the worst of deaths if they proved false.[865]\r\nIn the legends of Rome, moreover, sporadic instances may be found of\r\nspecial miraculous interposition to decide the question of innocence\r\nor guilt, when the gods properly appealed to would intervene to save\r\ntheir worshippers. These manifestations were principally vouchsafed in\r\nfavor of the Vestals, as when the pupil of Æmilia was accused of having\r\nallowed the sacred fire to be extinguished, and was preserved by its\r\nspontaneous ignition on her placing the skirt of her garment upon the\r\naltar; or when Tucca, falsely arraigned for unchastity, vindicated her\r\npurity by carrying water in a sieve; or when Claudia Quinta, under a\r\nsimilar charge, made good her defence by dragging, with a slender cord,\r\na ship against the rapid current of the Tiber after it had run aground\r\nand resisted all efforts to move it—and this with an invocation to the\r\ngoddess to absolve or condemn her, as she was innocent or guilty, which\r\ngives to the affair a marked resemblance to an established form of\r\njudicial ordeal.[866] Occasional instances such as these had, however,\r\nno influence on the forms and principles of Roman jurisprudence, which\r\nwas based on reason and not on superstition. With the exception of the\r\nuse of torture, as we shall see hereafter, the accused was not required\r\nto exculpate himself. He was presumed to be innocent, and the burden\r\nof proof lay not on him but on the prosecutor. The maxim of the civil\r\nlaw—“Accusatore non probante, reus absolvitur”—is entirely incompatible\r\nwith the whole theory upon which the system of ordeals is based.[867]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe barbarian Aryans who occupied Europe brought with them the\r\nancestral beliefs in a form more easily recognizable than the remnants\r\nwhich survived through Hellenic and Italiote civilization. The Feini,\r\nor Irish Celts, boasted that their ancient Brehons, or judges, were\r\nwarned by supernatural manifestations as to the equity of the judgments\r\nwhich they rendered. Sometimes these took the shape of blotches on\r\ntheir cheeks when they pronounced false judgments. Sen Mac Aige was\r\nsubject to these marks, but with him they disappeared when he decided\r\nrighteously, while Sencha Mac Aillila was less fortunate, for he\r\nwas visited with three permanent blotches for each mistake. Fachtna\r\nreceived the surname of Tulbrethach because, whenever he delivered\r\na false judgment, “if in the time of fruit, all the fruit in the\r\nterritory in which it happened fell off in one night; if in time of\r\nmilk, the cows refused their calves; but if he passed a true judgment,\r\nthe fruit was perfect on the trees.” Morann never pronounced a judgment\r\nwithout wearing around his neck a chain, which tightened upon him if\r\nthe judgment was false, but expanded down upon him if it were true.\r\nThese quaint legends have their interest as manifesting the importance\r\nattached by the ancient Irish to the impartial administration of\r\nabsolute justice, and the belief entertained that a supernatural power\r\nwas ever on the watch over the tribunals, but these manifestations were\r\ntoo late to arrest injustice, as they did not occur until after it was\r\ncommitted. The Feini therefore did not abandon the ancient resource\r\nof the ordeal, as is shown by a provision in the Senchus Mor, which\r\ngrants a delay of ten days to a man obliged to undergo the test of\r\nboiling water.[868] The Celts of the Rhinelands also had a local custom\r\nof determining the legitimacy of children by an ordeal of the purest\r\nchance, which became a common-place of Roman rhetoric, and is thus\r\ndescribed in the Anthology:—\r\n\r\n\r\nΘαρσαλέοι Κελτοὶ ποταμῷ ζηλήμονι Ρήνω χ. τ. λ.\r\n\r\n    Upon the waters of the jealous Rhine\r\n      The savage Celts their children cast, nor own\r\n    Themselves as fathers till the power divine\r\n      Of the chaste river shall the truth make known.\r\n    Scarce breathed its first faint cry, the husband tears\r\n      Away the new-born babe, and to the wave\r\n    Commits it on his shield, nor for it cares\r\n      Till the wife-judging stream the infant save,\r\n    And prove himself the sire. All trembling lies\r\n      The mother, racked with anguish, knowing well\r\n    The truth, but forced to risk her cherished prize\r\n      On the inconstant waters’ reckless swell.[869]\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic tribes, anterior to their conversion, likewise exhibit the\r\nordeal as a recognized resource in judicial proceedings. The Norræna\r\nbranch, as we have seen, cultivated the _holm-gang_, or duel, with\r\nardor, and they likewise employed the hot-water ordeal, besides a\r\nmilder form peculiar to themselves entitled the _skirsla_, in which one\r\nof the parties to a suit could prove the truth of his oath by passing\r\nunder a strip of turf raised so that it formed an arch with each end\r\nresting on the ground, the belief being that if he had forsworn himself\r\nthe turf would fall on him as he passed beneath it.[870] The Germanic\r\ntribes, in their earliest jurisprudence, afford similar evidence of\r\nadherence to the customs of their eastern brethren. The most ancient\r\nextant recension of the Salic law may safely be assumed as coeval with\r\nthe conversion of Clovis, as it is free from all allusions to Christian\r\nrules, such as appear in the later versions, and in this the trial\r\nby boiling water finds its place as a judicial process in regular\r\nuse.[871] Among the Bavarians, the decree of Duke Tassilo in 772\r\ncondemns as a relic of pagan rites a custom named _stapfsaken_, used in\r\ncases of disputed debt, which is evidently a kind of ordeal from the\r\nformula employed, “Let us stretch forth our right hands to the just\r\njudgment of God!”[872]\r\n\r\nThe Slavs equally bear witness to the ancestral practice of the ordeal\r\nas a judicial process. The _prauda jeliezo_, or hot-iron ordeal, was in\r\nuse among them in early times.[873] In Bohemia, the laws of Brzetislas,\r\npromulgated in 1039, make no allusion to any other form of evidence\r\nin contested cases, while in Russia it was the final resort in all\r\nprosecutions for murder, theft, and false accusation.[874]\r\n\r\nAs the Barbarians established themselves on the ruins of the Roman\r\nEmpire and embraced Christianity they, with one exception, cultivated\r\nthe institution of the ordeal with increased ardor. This exception\r\nis found in the Gothic nations, and is ascribable, as we have seen\r\nwhen treating of the judicial combat, to the influence of the Roman\r\ncustoms and laws which they adopted. For nearly two centuries after\r\ntheir settlement, there is no allusion in their body of laws to any\r\nform of ordeal. It was not until 693, long after the destruction of\r\ntheir supremacy in the south of France, and but little prior to their\r\noverthrow in Spain by the Saracens, that King Egiza, with the sanction\r\nof a Council of Toledo, issued an edict commanding the employment of\r\nthe _æneum_ or ordeal of boiling water.[875]\r\n\r\nVarious causes were at work among the other tribes to stimulate the\r\nfavor with which the ordeal was regarded. As respects the wager of\r\nbattle I have already traced its career as a peculiarly European form\r\nof the Judgment of God, which was fostered by the advantage which it\r\ngave, in the times of nascent feudalism, to the bold and reckless. With\r\nregard to the other forms, one reason for their increased prevalence is\r\ndoubtless to be found in the universal principle of the Barbarians, in\r\ntheir successive settlements, to allow all races to retain their own\r\njurisprudence, however much individuals might be intermingled, socially\r\nand politically. The confusion to which this gave birth is well set\r\nforth by St. Agobard, when he remarks that frequently five men shall be\r\nfound in close companionship, each one owning obedience to a different\r\nlaw. He also states that under the Burgundian rules of procedure, no\r\none was allowed to bear witness against a man of different race.[876]\r\nUnder these circumstances, in a large proportion of cases there could\r\nbe no legal evidence attainable, and recourse was had of necessity to\r\nthe Judgment of God. Even when this rule was not in force, a man who\r\nappealed to Heaven against the testimony of a witness of different\r\norigin would be apt to find the court disposed to grant his request. If\r\nthe judge, moreover, was a compatriot of one of the pleaders, the other\r\nwould naturally distrust his impartiality, and would prefer to have\r\nthe case decided by the Omniscient whose direct interposition he was\r\ntaught to regard as undoubted. That the assumed fairness of the ordeal\r\nwas highly prized under such circumstances we have evidence in the\r\nprovisions of a treaty between the Welsh and the Saxons, about the year\r\n1000, according to which all questions between individuals of the two\r\nraces were to be settled in this manner, in the absence of a special\r\nagreement between the parties.[877]\r\n\r\nThe most efficient cause of the increased use of the ordeal was,\r\nhowever, to be found in the Church. With her customary tact, in\r\nconverting the Barbarians, she adopted such of their customs as she\r\ncould adapt to Christian belief and practice; and she accepted the\r\nordeal as an undoubted appeal to God, whose response was regarded as\r\nunquestionable, warrant being easily found for this in the Jewish\r\npractices already described. The pagan ceremonies were moulded into\r\nChristian rites, and the most solemn forms of religion were thrown\r\naround the rude expedients invented thousands of years before by\r\nthe Bactrian nomads. Elaborate rituals were constructed, including\r\ncelebration of mass and impressive prayers, adjurations and exorcisms\r\nof the person to undergo the trial and of the materials used in it,\r\nand the most implicit faith was inculcated in the interposition of\r\nGod to defend the right and to punish guilt.[878] The administration\r\nof the ordeal being thus reserved for priestly hands, the Church\r\nacquired a vastly increased influence as the minister of justice, to\r\nsay nothing of the revenues thence arising, and the facility with which\r\necclesiastics could thus defend themselves when legally assailed by\r\ntheir turbulent flocks. We are not without evidence of the manner in\r\nwhich the church thus favored the use of this Christianized paganism,\r\nand introduced it along with Christianity among people to whom it\r\nwas previously unknown. Thus among the Turanian Majjars, the laws of\r\nKing Stephen, promulgated in 1216, soon after his conversion, contain\r\nno allusion to the ordeal, but in those of Ladislas and Coloman,\r\nissued towards the end of the century, it is found, in its various\r\nforms, thoroughly established as a means of legal proof.[879] So,\r\nwhen in the twelfth century Bishop Geroldus converted the Slavs of\r\nMecklenburg, they were at once forbidden to settle questions by oaths\r\ntaken on trees, fountains, and stones, as before, but were required to\r\nbring their criminals before the priest to be tried by the hot iron\r\nor ploughshares.[880] Under the Crusaders, the ordeal was carried\r\nback towards the home of its birth, even contaminating the Byzantine\r\ncivilization, and various instances of its use are related by the\r\nhistorians of the Lower Empire to a period as late as the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of the church and the superstition of the people\r\nincreased somewhat the varieties of the ordeal which we have seen\r\nemployed in the East. Besides the judicial combat, the modes by which\r\nthe will of Heaven was ascertained may be classed as the ordeal of\r\nboiling water, of red-hot iron, of fire, of cold water, of the balance,\r\nof the cross, of the _corsnœd_ or swallowing bread or cheese, of the\r\nEucharist, of the lot, bier-right, oaths on relics, and poison ordeals.\r\nIn some of these, it will be seen, a miraculous interposition was\r\nrequired for an acquittal, in others for a condemnation; some depended\r\naltogether on volition, others on the purest chance; while others,\r\nagain, derived their efficacy from the influence exerted over the mind\r\nof the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF BOILING WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of boiling water (_æneum, judicium aquæ ferventis, cacabus,\r\ncaldaria_) is the one usually referred to in the most ancient texts\r\nof laws. It was a favorite both with the secular and ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities, and the manner in which the pagan usages of the ancient\r\nAryans were adopted and rendered orthodox by the Church is well\r\nillustrated by the commendation bestowed on it by Hincmar, Archbishop\r\nof Reims, in the ninth century. It combines, he says, the elements\r\nof water and of fire; the one representing the deluge—the judgment\r\ninflicted on the wicked of old; the other authorized by the fiery\r\ndoom of the future—the day of judgment, in both of which we see the\r\nrighteous escape and the wicked suffer.[881] There were several minor\r\nvariations in its administration, but none of them departed to any\r\nnotable extent from the original form as invented in the East. A\r\ncaldron of water was brought to the boiling-point, and the accused was\r\nobliged with his naked hand to find a small stone or ring thrown into\r\nit; sometimes the latter portion was omitted, and the hand was simply\r\ninserted, in trivial cases to the wrist, in crimes of magnitude to\r\nthe elbow; the former being termed the single, the latter the triple\r\nordeal;[882] or, again, the stone was employed, suspended by a string,\r\nand the severity of the trial was regulated by the length of the line,\r\na palm’s breadth being counted as single, and the distance to the elbow\r\nas triple.[883] A good example of the process, in all its details,\r\nis furnished us by Gregory of Tours, who relates that an Arian priest\r\nand a Catholic deacon, disputing about their respective tenets, and\r\nbeing unable to convince each other, the latter proposed to refer the\r\nsubject to the decision of the _æneum_, and the offer was accepted.\r\nNext morning the deacon’s enthusiasm cooled, and he mingled his matins\r\nwith precautions of a less spiritual nature, by bathing his arm in\r\noil, and anointing it with protective unguents. The populace assembled\r\nto witness the exhibition, the fire was lighted, the caldron boiled\r\nfuriously, and a little ring thrown into it was whirled around like a\r\nstraw in a tornado, when the deacon politely invited his adversary to\r\nmake the trial first. This was declined, on the ground that precedence\r\nbelonged to the challenger, and with no little misgiving the deacon\r\nproceeded to roll up his sleeve, when the Arian, observing the\r\nprecautions that had been taken, exclaimed that he had been using magic\r\narts, and that the trial would amount to nothing. At this critical\r\njuncture, when the honor of the orthodox faith was trembling in the\r\nbalance, a stranger stepped forward—a Catholic priest named Jacintus,\r\nfrom Ravenna—and offered to undergo the experiment. Plunging his arm\r\ninto the bubbling caldron, he was two hours in capturing the ring,\r\nwhich eluded his grasp in its fantastic gyrations; but finally, holding\r\nit up in triumph to the admiring spectators, he declared that the water\r\nfelt cold at the bottom, with an agreeable warmth at the top. Fired\r\nby the example, the unhappy Arian boldly thrust in his arm; but the\r\nfalseness of his cause belied the confidence of its rash supporter, and\r\nin a moment the flesh was boiled off the bones up to the elbow.[884]\r\n\r\nThis was a volunteer experiment. As a means of judicial investigation,\r\nthe Church, in adopting it with the other ordeals, followed the policy\r\nof surrounding it with all the solemnity which her most venerated rites\r\ncould impart, thus imitating, no doubt unconsciously, the customs\r\nof the Hindus, who, from the earliest times, have made the ordeal\r\na religious ceremony, to be conducted by Brahmans, with invocations\r\nto the divine powers, and to be performed by the patient at sunrise,\r\nimmediately after the prescribed ablutions, and while yet fasting.[885]\r\nWith the same object, in the European ordeal, fasting and prayer were\r\nenjoined for three days previous, and the ceremony commenced with\r\nspecial prayers and adjurations, introduced for the purpose into the\r\nlitany, and recited by the officiating priests; mass was celebrated,\r\nand the accused was required to partake of the sacrament under the\r\nfearful adjuration, “This body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ be to\r\nthee this day a manifestation!” This was followed by an exorcism of the\r\nwater, of which numerous formulas are on record, varying in detail, but\r\nall manifesting the robust faith with which man assumed to control the\r\naction of his Creator. A single specimen will suffice.\r\n\r\n “O creature of water, I adjure thee by the living God, by the holy\r\n God who in the beginning separated thee from the dry land; I adjure\r\n thee by the living God who led thee from the fountain of Paradise,\r\n and in four rivers commanded thee to encompass the world; I adjure\r\n thee by Him who in Cana of Galilee by His will changed thee to wine,\r\n who trod on thee with His holy feet, who gave thee the name Siloa; I\r\n adjure thee by the God who in thee cleansed Naaman, the Syrian, of his\r\n leprosy;—saying, O holy water, O blessed water, water which washest\r\n the dust and sins of the world, I adjure thee by the living God that\r\n thou shalt show thyself pure, nor retain any false image, but shalt be\r\n exorcised water, to make manifest and reveal and bring to naught all\r\n falsehood, and to make manifest and bring to light all truth; so that\r\n he who shall place his hand in thee, if his cause be just and true,\r\n shall receive no hurt; but if he be perjured, let his hand be burned\r\n with fire, that all men may know the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n who will come, with the Holy Ghost, to judge with fire the quick and\r\n the dead, and the world! Amen!”[886]\r\n\r\nAfter the hand had been plunged in the seething caldron, it was\r\ncarefully enveloped in a cloth, sealed with the signet of the judge,\r\nand three days afterwards it was unwrapped, when the guilt or innocence\r\nof the party was announced by the condition of the member.[887] By way\r\nof extra precaution, in some rituals it is ordered that during this\r\ninterval holy water and blessed salt be mingled in all the food and\r\ndrink of the patient—presumably to avert diabolic interference with the\r\nresult.[888]\r\n\r\nThe judicial use of this ordeal is shown in a charter of the monastery\r\nof Sobrada in Galicia, when, about 987, the Bishop of Lugo claimed of\r\nit for his church the manor of Villarplano. After a vain effort to\r\ndecide the question by evidence, the representatives of the monastery\r\ntook a solemn oath as to its rights and offered to confirm it by the\r\n_pæna caldaria_. In the church of San Juliano some fifty or sixty\r\nnotables from both sides assembled; a monk named Salamiro was conducted\r\nto the boiling caldron by a person representing each claimant, and\r\nthere he drew forth ten stones from the bubbling water. His arm was\r\nsealed up and three or four days later was exhibited uninjured to the\r\nassembly. The proof was conclusive and the Bishop of Lugo abandoned his\r\nclaim.[889]\r\n\r\nThe justification of this mode of procedure by its most able defender,\r\nHincmar of Reims, is similar in spirit to the above form of adjuration.\r\nKing Lothair, great-grandson of Charlemagne, desiring to get rid of\r\nhis wife, Teutberga, accused her of the foulest incest, and forced her\r\nto a confession, which she afterwards recanted, proving her innocence\r\nby undergoing the ordeal of hot water by proxy. Lothair, nevertheless,\r\nmarried his concubine Waldrada, and for ten years the whole of Europe\r\nwas occupied with the degrading details of the quarrel, council after\r\ncouncil assembling to consider the subject, and the thunders of Rome\r\nbeing freely employed. Hincmar, the most conspicuous ecclesiastic of\r\nhis day, stood boldly forth in defence of the unhappy queen, and in\r\nhis treatise “De Divortio Lotharii et Teutbergæ,” although no one\r\nat the time seriously thought of impugning the authority of ordeals\r\nin general, it suited his purpose to insist upon their claims to\r\ninfallibility. His line of argument shows how thoroughly the pagan\r\ncustom had become Christianized, and how easily the churchman could\r\nfind reasons for attributing to God the interposition which his\r\nancestors had ascribed to Mithra, or to Agni, or to Thor. “Because\r\nin boiling water the guilty are scalded and the innocent are unhurt,\r\nbecause Lot escaped unharmed from the fire of Sodom, and the future\r\nfire which will precede the terrible Judge will be harmless to the\r\nSaints, and will burn the wicked as in the Babylonian furnace of\r\nold.”[890]\r\n\r\nIn the Life of St. Ethelwold is recorded a miracle, which, though not\r\njudicial, yet, from its description by a contemporary, affords an\r\ninsight into the credulous faith which rendered lawgivers ready to\r\nintrust the most important interests to decisions of this nature. The\r\nholy saint, while Abbot of Abingdon, to test the obedience of Elfstan\r\nthe cook of the monastery, ordered him to extract with his hand a piece\r\nof meat from the bottom of a caldron in which the conventual dinner was\r\nboiling. Without hesitation the monk plunged his hand into the seething\r\nmass and unhurt presented the desired morsel to his wondering superior.\r\nFaith such as this could not go unrewarded, and Elfstan, from his\r\nhumble station, rose to the episcopal seat of Winchester.[891]\r\n\r\nThis form of trial was in use among all the races in whose legislation\r\nthe _purgatio vulgaris_ found place. It is the only mode alluded to\r\nin the Salic Law, from the primitive text to the amended code of\r\nCharlemagne.[892] The same may be said of the Wisigoths, as we have\r\nalready seen; while the codes of the Frisians, the Anglo-Saxons, and\r\nthe Lombards, all refer cases to its decision.[893] In Iceland, it was\r\nemployed from the earliest times;[894] in the primitive jurisprudence\r\nof Russia its use was enjoined in cases of minor importance,[895] and\r\nit continued in vogue throughout Europe until the general discredit\r\nattached to this mode of judgment led to the gradual abandonment of\r\nthe ordeal as a legal process. It is among the forms enumerated in the\r\nsweeping condemnation of the whole system, in 1215, by Innocent III.\r\nin the Fourth Council of Lateran; but even subsequently we find it\r\nprescribed in certain cases by the municipal laws in force throughout\r\nthe whole of Northern and Southern Germany,[896] and as late as 1282 it\r\nis specified in a charter of Gaston of Béarn, conferring on a church\r\nthe privilege of holding ordeals.[897] At a later date, indeed, it\r\nwas sometimes administered in a different and more serious form, the\r\naccused being expected to swallow the boiling water. I have met with\r\nno instances recorded of this, but repeated allusions to it by Rickius\r\nshow that it could not have been unusual.[898] Another variant is seen\r\nin the case of a monk who had brought the body of St. Helena to his\r\nconvent and was forced to prove its genuineness by complete immersion\r\nin boiling water—a trial which he endured successfully.[899]\r\n\r\nThe modern Hindoo variety of this ordeal consists in casting a piece of\r\ngold or a metal ring into a vessel of boiling _ghee_, or sesame oil,\r\nof a specified size and depth. Sacrifices are offered to the gods, a\r\nmantra, or Vedic prayer, is uttered over the oil, which is heated until\r\nit burns a fresh peepul leaf, and if the person on trial can extract\r\nthe ring between his finger and thumb, without scalding himself, he is\r\npronounced victorious.[900] In 1783 a case is recorded as occurring at\r\nBenares, in which a Brahman accused a linen-painter of theft, and as\r\nthere was no other way of settling the dispute, both parties agreed\r\nto abide by the result of the ordeal. At that time the East India\r\nCompany was endeavoring to discountenance this superstition, but could\r\nnot venture to abolish it forcibly, and as persuasion was unavailing\r\nthe accused was allowed to undergo the experiment, which resulted in\r\nhis conviction. Not much confidence, however, seems to have been felt\r\nin the trial, as the fine incurred by him was not enforced.[901] Of\r\ncourse, under the influence of English rule, this and all other ordeals\r\nare legally obsolete, but the popular belief in them is not easily\r\neradicated. So lately as 1867 the Bombay _Gazette_ records a case\r\noccurring at Jamnuggur, when a camel-driver named Chakee Soomar, under\r\nwhose charge a considerable sum of money was lost, was exposed by a\r\nlocal official to the ordeal of boiling oil. The authorities, however,\r\ntook prompt measures to punish this act of cruelty. The _karb-haree_\r\nwho ordered it escaped chastisement by opportunely dying, but the\r\nowner of the treasure, who had urged the trial, was condemned to pay\r\nto the camel-driver a pension of 100 rupees during life. In 1868 the\r\nMadras _Times_ chronicled an attempt to revive the practice among the\r\nBrahmans of Travancore. About thirty years before it had been abolished\r\nby the British authorities, but previous to that time it was performed\r\nby placing a small silver ball in a brazen vessel eight inches deep,\r\nfilled with boiling ghee. After various religious ceremonies, the\r\naccused plunged in his hand, and sometimes was obliged to repeat\r\nthe attempt several times before he could bring out the ball. The\r\nhand was then wrapped up in tender palm leaves and examined after an\r\ninterval of three days. In 1866 some Brahmans in danger of losing caste\r\nendeavored to regain their position by obtaining permission to undergo\r\na modification of this trial, substituting cold oil for boiling ghee.\r\nThe authorities made no objection to this, but the holy society refused\r\nto consider it a valid purgation.\r\n\r\nChristian faith improved on the simplicity of pagan devices, and\r\nwas able, through the intermediation of men of supreme sanctity, to\r\ninduce Heaven to render the ordeal still more miraculous. D’Achery\r\nquotes from a contemporary MS. life of the holy Pons, Abbot of Andaone\r\nnear Avignon, a miracle which relates that one morning after mass,\r\nas he was about to cross the Rhone, he met two men quarrelling over\r\na ploughshare, which, after being lost for several days, had been\r\nfound buried in the ground, and which each accused the other of having\r\npurloined and hidden. As the question was impenetrable to human wisdom,\r\nPons intervened and told them to place the ploughshare in the water\r\nof the river, within easy reach. Then, making over it the sign of the\r\ncross, he ordered the disputant who was most suspected to lift it out\r\nof the river. The man accordingly plunged his arm into the stream only\r\nto withdraw it, exclaiming that the water was boiling, and showed his\r\nhand fearfully scalded, thus affording the most satisfactory evidence\r\nof his guilt.[902] St. Bertrand, Bishop of Comminges, adopted a similar\r\nmethod in a case of disputed paternity. A poor woman came to him with\r\na starving infant, which the father refused to recognize or provide\r\nfor, lest such evidence of sin should render him ineligible for an\r\necclesiastical benefice. The bishop summoned the offender, who stoutly\r\ndenied the allegation, until a vessel of cold water was brought and a\r\nstone thrown in, when the bishop blessed the water, and ordered the\r\nfather to take out the stone, saying that the result would show the\r\ntruth or falsity of his asseverations. Full of confidence, the man\r\nplunged in his hand and brought out the stone, with his hand scalded\r\nas though the water had been boiling. He promptly admitted his guilt,\r\nacknowledged the child, and thenceforth provided for it.[903] Similar\r\nto this was the incident which drove the holy St. Gengulphus from the\r\nworld. While yet a warrior and favorite of King Pepin, during his\r\ntravels in Italy he was attracted by a way-side fountain, and bought\r\nit from the owner, who imagined that it could not be removed from his\r\npossessions. On his return to France, Gengulphus drove his staff into\r\nthe ground near his house, in a convenient place, and on its being\r\nwithdrawn next day, the obedient stream, which had followed him from\r\nItaly, burst forth. He soon learned that during his absence his wife\r\nhad proved unfaithful to him with a priest, and desiring to test her\r\ninnocence, he took her to the fountain and told her that she could\r\ndisprove the reports against her by picking up a hair which lay at the\r\nbottom of the pool. She boldly did this, but on withdrawing her hand it\r\nwas fearfully scalded, the skin and flesh hanging in strips from her\r\nfinger-ends. He pardoned her and retired from the world, but she was\r\nimplacable, and took her revenge by inciting her paramour to murder\r\nhim.[904]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF RED-HOT IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost all ages there has existed the belief that under the\r\ndivine influence the human frame was able to resist the action of\r\nfire. Even the sceptic Pliny seems to share the superstition as to\r\nthe families of the Hirpi, who at the annual sacrifice made to\r\nApollo, on Mount Soracte, walked without injury over piles of burning\r\ncoals, in recognition of which, by a perpetual senatus consultum,\r\nthey were relieved from all public burdens.[905] That fire applied\r\neither directly or indirectly should be used in the appeal to God was\r\ntherefore natural, and the convenience with which it could be employed\r\nby means of iron rendered that the most usual form of the ordeal. As\r\nemployed in Europe, under the name of _judicium ferri_ or _juise_ it\r\nwas administered in two essentially different forms. The one (_vomeres\r\nigniti, examen pedale_) consisted in laying on the ground at certain\r\ndistances six, nine, or in some cases twelve, red-hot ploughshares,\r\namong which the accused walked barefooted, sometimes blindfolded,\r\nwhen it became an ordeal of pure chance, and sometimes compelled to\r\npress each iron with his naked feet.[906] The other and more usual\r\nform obliged the patient to carry in his hand for a certain distance,\r\nusually nine feet, a piece of red-hot iron, the weight of which was\r\ndetermined by law and varied with the importance of the question\r\nat issue or the magnitude of the alleged crime. Thus, among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, in the “simple ordeal” the iron weighed one pound, in the\r\n“triple ordeal” three pounds. The latter is prescribed for incendiaries\r\nand “morth-slayers” (secret murderers), for false coining, and for\r\nplotting against the king’s life; while at a later period, in the\r\ncollection known as the Laws of Henry I., we find it extended to cases\r\nof theft, robbery, arson, and felonies in general.[907] In Sweden,\r\nfor theft, the form known as _trux iarn_ was employed, in which the\r\naccused had to carry the red-hot iron and deposit it in a hole twelve\r\npaces from the starting-point; in other cases the ordeal was called\r\n_scuz iarn_, when he carried it nine paces and then cast it from him.\r\nThese ordeals were held on Wednesday, after fasting on bread and water\r\non Monday and Tuesday; the hand or foot was washed, after which it was\r\nallowed to touch nothing till it came in contact with the iron; it\r\nwas then wrapped up and sealed until Saturday, when it was opened in\r\npresence of the accuser and the judges.[908] In Spain, the iron had no\r\ndefinite weight, but was a palm and two fingers in length, with four\r\nfeet, high enough to enable the criminal to lift it conveniently.[909]\r\nThe episcopal benediction was necessary to consecrate the iron to its\r\njudicial use. A charter of 1082 shows that the Abbey of Fontanelle in\r\nNormandy had one of approved sanctity, which, through the ignorance\r\nof a monk, was applied to other purposes. The Abbot thereupon asked\r\nthe Archbishop of Rouen to consecrate another, and before the latter\r\nwould consent the institution had to prove its right to administer\r\nthe ordeal.[910] The wrapping up and sealing of the hand was a\r\ngeneral custom, derived from the East, and usually after three days\r\nit was uncovered and the decision was rendered in accordance with its\r\ncondition.[911] These proceedings were accompanied by the same solemn\r\nobservances which have been already described, the iron itself was\r\nduly exorcised, and the intervention of God was invoked in the name of\r\nall the manifestations of Divine clemency or wrath by the agency of\r\nfire—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the burning bush of Horeb, the\r\ndestruction of Sodom, and the day of judgment.[912] Occasionally, when\r\nseveral criminals were examined together, the same piece of heated iron\r\nwas borne by them successively, giving a manifest advantage to the\r\nlast one, who had to endure a temperature considerably less than his\r\ncompanions.[913]\r\n\r\nIn India this was one of the earliest forms of the ordeal, in use\r\neven in the Vedic period, as it is referred to in the Khandogya\r\nUpanishad of the Sama Veda, where the head of a hatchet is alluded to\r\nas the implement employed for the trial—subsequently replaced by a\r\nploughshare.[914] In the seventh century, A. D., Hiouen Thsang reports\r\nthat the red-hot iron was applied to the tongue of the accused as well\r\nas to the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, his innocence\r\nbeing designated by the amount of resultant injury.[915] This may have\r\nbeen a local custom, for, according to Institutes of Vishnu, closely\r\nfollowed by Yajnavalkya, the patient bathes and performs certain\r\nreligious ceremonies; then after rubbing his hands with rice bran,\r\nseven green asvattha leaves are placed on the extended palms and bound\r\nwith a thread. A red-hot iron ball or spear-head, weighing about two\r\npounds and three-quarters, is then brought, and the judge adjures it—\r\n\r\n “Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all things like a witness.\r\n O fire, thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.\r\n\r\n “This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared from guilt.\r\n Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.”\r\n\r\nThe glowing ball is then placed on the hands of the accused, and with\r\nit he has to walk across seven concentric circles of cow-dung, each\r\nwith a radius sixteen fingers’ breadth larger than the preceding, and\r\nthrow the ball into a ninth circle, where it must burn some grass\r\nplaced there for the purpose. If this be accomplished without burning\r\nthe hands, he gains his cause, but the slightest injury convicts him.\r\nA minimum limit of a thousand pieces of silver was established at an\r\nearly period as requisite to justify the administration of this form of\r\nordeal in a suit.[916] But the robust faith in the power of innocence\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier Hindus seems to have diminished, for\r\nsubsequent recensions of the code and later lawgivers increase the\r\nprotection afforded to the hand by adding to the asvattha leaves\r\nadditional strata of dharba grass and barley moistened with curds, the\r\nwhole bound around with seven turns of raw silk.[917] Ali Ibrahim Khan\r\nrelates a case which he witnessed at Benares in 1783 in which a man\r\nnamed Sancar, accused of larceny, offered to be tried in this manner.\r\nThe court deliberated for four months, urging the parties to adopt some\r\nother mode, but they were obstinate, and being both Hindus claimed\r\ntheir right to the ancient forms of law, which was at last conceded.\r\nThe ordeal took place in presence of a large assemblage, when, to\r\nthe surprise of every one, Sancar carried the red-hot ball through\r\nthe seven circles, threw it duly into the ninth where it burnt the\r\ngrass, and exhibited his hands uninjured. By way of discouraging such\r\nexperiments for the future, the accuser was imprisoned for a week.[918]\r\nEven in 1873, the Bombay _Gazette_ states that this ordeal is still\r\npractised in Oodeypur, where a case had shortly before occurred wherein\r\na husbandman had been obliged to prove his innocence by holding a\r\nred-hot ploughshare in his hands, duly guarded with peepul leaves,\r\nturning his face towards the sun and invoking it: “Thou Sun-God, if\r\nI am actually guilty of the crime, punish me; if not, let me escape\r\nunscathed from the ordeal!”—and in this instance, also, the accused was\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nA peculiar modification of the hot-iron ordeal is employed by the\r\naboriginal hill-tribes of Rajmahal, in the north of Bengal, when a\r\nperson believes himself to be suffering from witchcraft. The _Satane_\r\nand the _Cherreen_ are used to find out the witch, and then the\r\ndecision is confirmed by a person representing the sufferer, who, with\r\ncertain religious ceremonies, applies his tongue to a red-hot iron\r\nnine times, unless sooner burnt. A burn is considered to render the\r\nguilt of the accused indubitable, and his only appeal is to have the\r\ntrial repeated in public, when, if the same result follows, he is bound\r\neither to cure the bewitched person or to suffer death if the latter\r\ndies.[919]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of European law, the burning iron was reserved\r\nfor cases of peculiar atrocity. Thus we find it prescribed by\r\nCharlemagne in accusations of parricide;[920] the Council of Risbach in\r\n799 directed its use in cases of sorcery and witchcraft;[921] and among\r\nthe Thuringians it was ordered for women suspected of poisoning or\r\notherwise murdering their husbands[922]—a crime visited with peculiar\r\nseverity in almost all codes. In 848 the Council of Mainz indicates\r\nit specially for slaves,[923] while the Council of Tribur, in 895,\r\norders it for all cases of accusation against freemen.[924] Among\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons the accuser had the right to select the ordeal to\r\nbe employed,[925] while at a later period in Germany this privilege\r\nwas conferred on the accused.[926] In England it subsequently became\r\nrather an aristocratic procedure as contradistinguished from the water\r\nordeals.[927] On the other hand, in the Assises de Jerusalem the\r\nhot iron is the only form alluded to as employed in the _roturier_\r\ncourts;[928] in the laws of Nieuport, granted by Philip of Alsace in\r\n1163, it is prescribed as a plebeian ordeal;[929] and about the same\r\nperiod, in the military laws enacted by Frederic Barbarossa during his\r\nsecond Italian expedition, it appears as a servile ordeal.[930] In the\r\nRussian law of the eleventh century, it is ordered in all cases where\r\nthe matter at stake amounts to more than half a _grivna_ of gold, while\r\nthe water ordeal is reserved for suits of less importance.[931] In the\r\nIcelandic code of the twelfth century it is prescribed for men, in\r\ncases in which women are required to undergo the hot-water ordeal;[932]\r\nwhile the reverse of this is seen in an English case occurring in\r\n1201, where six men and a woman were accused of burglary; the men\r\nwere ordered to the water ordeal and the woman to red-hot iron.[933]\r\nA specially severe form was provided for women in Ireland, who, when\r\naccused, were obliged to lick with the tongue a bronze axe-head heated\r\nto redness in a fire of black-thorn.[934]\r\n\r\nIrrespective of these distinctions, we find it to have been the mode\r\nusually selected by persons of rank when compelled to throw themselves\r\nupon the judgment of God. The Empress Richardis, wife of Charles le\r\nGros, accused in 887 of adultery with Bishop Liutward, offered to prove\r\nher innocence either by the judicial combat or the red-hot iron.[935]\r\nSo when the Emperor St. Henry II. indulged in unworthy doubts of the\r\npurity of his virgin-wife St. Cunigunda, she eagerly appealed to the\r\njudgment of God, and established her innocence by treading unharmed\r\nthe burning ploughshares.[936] The tragical tradition of Mary, wife of\r\nthe Third Otho, contains a similar example, with the somewhat unusual\r\nvariation of an accuser undergoing an ordeal to prove a charge. The\r\nempress, hurried away by a sudden and unconquerable passion for Amula,\r\nCount of Modena, in 996, repeated in all its details the story of\r\nPotiphar’s wife. The unhappy count, unceremoniously condemned to lose\r\nhis head, asserted his innocence to his wife, and entreated her to\r\nclear his reputation. He was executed, and the countess, seeking an\r\naudience of the emperor, disproved the calumny by carrying unharmed the\r\nred-hot iron, when Otho, convinced of his rashness by this triumphant\r\nvindication, immediately repaired his injustice by consigning his\r\nempress to the stake.[937] When Edward the Confessor, who entertained\r\na not unreasonable dislike for his mother Emma, listened eagerly to the\r\naccusation of her criminal intimacy with Alwyn, Bishop of Winchester,\r\nshe was condemned to undergo the ordeal of the burning shares, and,\r\nwalking over them barefooted and unharmed, she established beyond\r\nperadventure the falsehood of the charge.[938] So when in 943 Arnoul\r\nof Flanders had procured the assassination of William Longsword,\r\nDuke of Normandy, at Pecquigny, he offered to Louis d’Outremer to\r\nclear himself of complicity in the murder by the ordeal of fire.[939]\r\nRobert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, while in exile during\r\nhis youthful rebellion against his father, formed an intimacy with\r\na pretty girl. Years afterwards, when he was Duke of Normandy, she\r\npresented herself before him with two likely youths, whom she asserted\r\nto be pledges of his former affection. Robert was incredulous; but\r\nthe mother, carrying unhurt the red-hot iron, forced him to forego\r\nhis doubts and to acknowledge the paternity of the boys, whom he\r\nthenceforth adopted.[940] Indeed this was the legal form of proof in\r\ncases of disputed paternity established by the Scandinavian legislation\r\nat this period,[941] and in that of Spain a century later.[942] Remy,\r\nBishop of Dorchester, when accused of treason against William the\r\nConqueror, was cleared by the devotion of a follower, who underwent the\r\nordeal of hot iron.[943] When, in 1098, William Rufus desired to supply\r\nhis treasury by confiscations, he accused about fifty of his richest\r\nSaxon subjects of having killed deer in his forests and hurried them\r\nto the hot-iron ordeal, but he was stupefied when after the third day\r\ntheir hands were found to be unhurt.[944] In 1143, Henry I., Archbishop\r\nof Mainz, ordered its employment, and administered it himself, in a\r\ncontroversy between the Abbey of Gerode and the Counts of Hirschberg.\r\nIn the special charter issued to the abbey attesting the decision of\r\nthe trial, it is recorded that the hand of the ecclesiastical champion\r\nwas not only uninjured by the fiery metal, but was positively benefited\r\nby it.[945] About the same period, Centulla IV. of Béarn caused it to\r\nbe employed in a dispute with the Bishop of Lescar concerning the fine\r\npaid for the murder of a priest, the ecclesiastic, as usual, being\r\nvictorious.[946] The reward of the church for its faith in adopting\r\nthese pagan customs was seen in the well-known case by which Bishop\r\nPoppo of Slesvick, in 962, succeeded in convincing and converting the\r\nPagan Danes even as, three thousand years earlier, according to the\r\nPersian historians, Zoroaster convinced King Gushtashp of the truth of\r\nhis revelation from Hormazd,[947] and, within seven centuries, Adurabad\r\nconverted the heretical Mazdeans. The worthy missionary, dining with\r\nKing Harold Blaatand, denounced, with more zeal than discretion, the\r\nindigenous deities as lying devils. The king dared him to prove his\r\nfaith in his God, and, on his assenting, caused next morning an immense\r\npiece of iron to be duly heated, which the undaunted Poppo grasped\r\nand carried around to the satisfaction of the royal court, displaying\r\nhis hand unscathed by the glowing mass; or, as a variant of the legend\r\nasserts, he drew on an iron gauntlet reaching to the elbow and heated\r\nto redness. The miracle was sufficient, and Denmark thenceforth becomes\r\nan integral portion of Christendom.[948] Somewhat similar, except in\r\nits results, was a case in which a priest involved in a theological\r\ndispute with a Jew, and unable to overcome him in argument, offered to\r\nprove the divinity of Christ by carrying a burning brand in his naked\r\nhand. Invoking the name of Jesus, the faithful ecclesiastic drew the\r\nblazing wood from the fire and slowly carried it for a considerable\r\ndistance, but though he triumphantly exhibited his hand unhurt, his\r\nobdurate antagonist refused to be converted, alleging that the miracle\r\nwas the result of magic.[949] In Norway, the sanctity of St. Olaf the\r\nKing was attested in the same way, when he thoughtlessly whittled a\r\ntwig on Sunday, and his attention was respectfully called by one of\r\nhis courtiers to this violation of the sabbatical rules. By way of\r\npenance he collected the chips, placed them on the palm of one hand,\r\nand set fire to them, but after they had been reduced to ashes, to the\r\nsurprise of the bystanders, his hand was found unharmed.[950]\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was scarcely a limit to the credulity which looked\r\nfor the constant interference of the divine power. About 1215 some\r\nheretics at Cambrai were convicted by the hot iron and sentenced to the\r\nstake. One of them was of noble birth, and on the way to the place of\r\nexecution the priest who had conducted the proceedings exhorted him to\r\nrepentance and conversion. The condemned man listened willingly, and\r\ncommenced to confess his errors. As he proceeded his hand commenced to\r\nheal, and when he had received absolution there remained no trace of\r\nthe burn. When he was called in turn to take his place at the stake,\r\nthe priest interposed, saying that he was innocent, and, on examination\r\nof the hand, he was released. About the same time a similar occurrence\r\nis recorded at Strassburg, where ten heretics had been thus convicted\r\nand condemned to be burnt, and one repenting at the last moment was\r\ncured of his burn, and was discharged. In this case, however, on his\r\nreturn to his house near the town, his wife upbraided him for his\r\nweakness in betraying the eternal truth to avoid a momentary suffering,\r\nand under her influence he relapsed. Immediately the burn on his hand\r\nreappeared, and a similar one took possession of his wife’s hand,\r\nscorching both to the bone and inflicting such excruciating agony\r\nthat being unable to repress their screams, and fearing to betray\r\nthemselves, they took to the woods, where they howled like wolves.\r\nConcealment was impossible, however. They were discovered, carried\r\nto the city, where the ashes of their accomplices were not yet cold,\r\nand both promptly shared the same fate.[951] Somewhat similar is a\r\ncase recorded in York, where a woman accused of homicide was exposed\r\nto the ordeal, resulting in a blister the size of a half walnut. She\r\nwas accordingly convicted by a jury of knights, but on her offering\r\na prayer at the tomb of St. William of York the blister disappeared.\r\nThereupon the royal justiciaries dismissed her as innocent, and\r\ndeclared the jury to be at the king’s mercy for rendering a false\r\nverdict.[952]\r\n\r\nNo form of ordeal was more thoroughly introduced throughout the whole\r\nextent of Europe. From Spain to Constantinople, and from Scandinavia\r\nto Naples, it was appealed to with confidence as an unfailing mode of\r\nascertaining the will of Heaven. The term _judicium_, indeed, was at\r\nlength understood to mean an ordeal, and generally that of hot iron,\r\nand in its barbarized form, _juise_, may almost always be considered\r\nto indicate this particular kind. In the Swedish law of the early 13th\r\ncentury, the red-hot iron was used in a large number of crimes, and the\r\nferocity of its employment is exemplified in the formula prescribed for\r\nhomicide. A person accused of murder on suspicion was always obliged to\r\njustify himself by carrying the hot iron for nine steps; and if he did\r\nnot appear to stand his trial when duly summoned, he might be forced\r\nto undergo a preliminary ordeal to prove that he had been unavoidably\r\ndetained. If he failed in this, he was condemned as guilty, but if he\r\nsucceeded in enduring it he was forced to perform the second ordeal to\r\nclear him of the crime itself; while the heir of the murdered man, so\r\nlong as no one succumbed in the trial, could successively accuse ten\r\nmen; for the last of whom, however, the nine burning ploughshares were\r\nsubstituted.[953] In the code of the Frankish kingdoms of the East, it\r\nis the only mode alluded to, except the duel, and it there retained\r\nits legal authority long after it had become obsolete elsewhere. The\r\nAssises de Jerusalem were in force in the Venetian colonies until the\r\nsixteenth century, and the manuscript preserved officially in the\r\narchives of Venice, described by Morelli as written in 1436, retains\r\nthe primitive directions for the employment of the _juise_.[954] Even\r\nthe Venetian translation, commenced in 1531, and finished in 1536, is\r\nequally scrupulous, although an act of the Council of Ten, April 10,\r\n1535, shows that these customs had fallen into desuetude and had been\r\nformally abolished.[955] In Hungary, the judicial records of Waradin\r\nfrom 1209 to 1235 contain 389 judgments, of which a large part were\r\ndetermined by the hot-iron ordeal.[956]\r\n\r\nThis ordeal even became partially naturalized among the Greeks,\r\nprobably as a result of the Latin domination at Constantinople. In\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century, the Emperor Theodore Lascaris\r\ndemanded that Michael Paleologus, who afterwards wore the imperial\r\ncrown, should clear himself of an accusation in this manner; but the\r\nArchbishop of Philadelphia, on being appealed to, pronounced that it\r\nwas a custom of the barbarians, condemned by the canons, and not to be\r\nemployed except by the special order of the emperor.[957] Yet George\r\nPachymere speaks of the custom as one not uncommon in his youth,\r\nand he describes at some length the ceremonies with which it was\r\nperformed.[958]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, even as late as 1310, in the proceedings against the Order\r\nof the Templars, at Mainz, Count Frederic, the master preceptor of\r\nthe Rhenish provinces, offered to substantiate his denial of the\r\naccusations by carrying the red-hot iron.[959] In Modena in 1329, in\r\na dispute between the German soldiers of Louis of Bavaria and the\r\ncitizens, the Germans offered to settle the question by carrying a\r\nred-hot bar; but when the townsfolks themselves accomplished the feat,\r\nand triumphantly showed that no burn had been inflicted, the Germans\r\ndenied the proof, and asserted that magic had been employed.[960]\r\n\r\nThough about this time it may be considered to have disappeared from\r\nthe ordinary proceedings of the secular courts, there was one class\r\nof cases in which its vitality still continued for a century and a\r\nhalf. The mysterious crime of witchcraft was so difficult of proof\r\nthat judicial ingenuity was taxed to its utmost to secure conviction,\r\nand the Devil was always ready to aid his followers and baffle the\r\nends of justice. The Inquisitor Sprenger, writing in 1487, therefore\r\nrecommends that, when a witch cannot be forced to confess her guilt\r\nby either prayers or torture, she shall be asked whether she will\r\nundergo the ordeal of red-hot iron; to this she will eagerly assent,\r\nknowing that she can rely on the friendly assistance of Satan to carry\r\nher through it unscathed, and this readiness will be good evidence\r\nof her guilt. He warns inexperienced judges moreover not to allow\r\nthe trial to take place, and thus afford to Satan the opportunity\r\nof triumph, and instances a case which occurred in 1484 before the\r\nCount of Furstenberg. A well-known witch was arrested and tried, but\r\nno confession could be extorted from her by all the refinements of\r\ntorture. Finally she offered to prove her innocence with the red-hot\r\niron, and the Count being young and unwary accepted the proposal,\r\nsentencing her to carry it three paces. She carried it for six paces\r\nand offered to hold it still longer, exhibiting her hand uninjured. The\r\nCount was forced to acquit her, and at the time that Sprenger wrote she\r\nwas still living, to the scandal of the faithful.[961]\r\n\r\nAfter the judicial use of the red-hot iron had at last died out, the\r\nsuperstition on which it was based still lingered, and men believed\r\nthat God would reverse the laws of nature to accomplish a special\r\nobject. About 1670 Georg Frese, a merchant of Hamburg, distinguished\r\nfor piety and probity, published an account, the truth of which was\r\nvouched for by many respectable eye-witnesses, stating that a friend\r\nof his named Witzendorff, who had bound himself to a young woman by\r\nterrible oaths, and then had proved false and caused her death, fell\r\ninto a despairing melancholy. He accused himself of the sin against the\r\nHoly Ghost, declared that his salvation was impossible, and refused\r\nto hope unless he could see a miracle wrought in his behalf. Frese at\r\nlength asked him what miracle he required, and on his replying that\r\nhe must see that fire would not burn, the intrepid consoler went to a\r\nblazing fire, picked out the burning coals and also a red-hot ring,\r\nwhich he brought to the sinner with uninjured hands and convinced him\r\nthat he could be saved by repentance. The moral drawn from the facts by\r\nthe narrator to whom we owe them, is that he who under Divine influence\r\nundertakes such ordeals will be preserved unharmed.[962]\r\n\r\nEven as we have seen that Heaven sometimes interposed to punish the\r\nguilty by a reversal of the hot-water ordeal, so the industrious belief\r\nof the Middle Ages found similar miracles in the hot-iron trial,\r\nespecially when Satan or some other mysterious influence nullified the\r\nappeal to God. Early in the thirteenth century a case is related in\r\nwhich a peasant to revenge himself on a neighbor employed a vagabond\r\nmonk to burn the house of the latter. The hot-iron ordeal was vainly\r\nemployed on all suspected of the crime; the house was rebuilt, the\r\nmonk again bribed, burnt it a second time, and again the ordeal\r\nproved vain. The owner again rebuilt his house, and kept in it the\r\nordeal-iron, ready for use. The monk, tempted with fresh promises,\r\npaid him another visit, and was hospitably received as before, when\r\nseeing the piece of iron, his curiosity was aroused and he asked what\r\nit was. The host handed it to him, explaining its use, but as soon as\r\nthe wretch took it, it burned him to the bone, when the other seeing\r\nin him the incendiary, seized him; he was duly tried, confessed his\r\nguilt, and was broken on the wheel.[963] A variant of this story\r\nrelates how a man accused of arson offered to prove his innocence\r\nby the red-hot iron, which he carried for a long distance and then\r\nshowed his hand uninjured. The ordeal-iron mysteriously vanished and\r\ncould not be found, until a year afterwards, when a laborer who was\r\nmending the highway came upon it under a layer of sand. It was still\r\nglowing fiercely, and when he attempted to pick it up, it burnt him\r\nseverely. The bystanders at once suspected him of the crime, and on\r\nthe appropriate means being taken he was forced to confess his guilt,\r\nwhich was duly punished by the wheel.[964] A less tragical example of\r\nthe same form of miracle was that wrought by the holy Suidger, Bishop\r\nof Munster, who suspected his chamberlain of the theft of a cup. As the\r\nman stoutly denied his guilt, Suidger ordered him to pick up a knife\r\nfrom the table, after he had mentally exorcised it. The cold metal\r\nburnt the culprit’s hand as though it had been red-hot, and he promptly\r\nconfessed his crime.[965]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of fire, administered directly, without the intervention\r\neither of water or of iron, is one of the most ancient forms, as is\r\nshown by the allusions to it in both the Hindu Vedic writings, the\r\nadventure of Siawush, and the passage in the Antigone of Sophocles (pp.\r\n266, 267, 270). In this, its simplest form, it may be considered the\r\norigin of the proverbial expression, “J’en mettrois la main au feu,”\r\nas an affirmation of positive belief,[966] showing how thoroughly\r\nthe whole system engrained itself in the popular mind. In India, as\r\npractised in modern times, its form approaches somewhat the ordeal\r\nof the burning ploughshares. A trench is dug nine hands in length,\r\ntwo spans in breadth, and one span in depth. This is filled with\r\npeepul wood, which is then set on fire, and the accused walks into it\r\nwith bare feet.[967] A more humane modification is described in the\r\nseventh century by Hiouen-Thsang as in use when the accused was too\r\ntender to undergo the trial by red-hot iron. He simply cast into the\r\nflames certain flower-buds, when, if they opened their leaves, he was\r\nacquitted; if they were burnt up, he was condemned.[968]\r\n\r\nAn anticipation of the fire ordeal may be found in the Rabbinical\r\nstory of Abraham when he was cast into a fiery furnace by Nimrod, for\r\nreproving the idolatry of the latter, and escaped unharmed from the\r\nflames;[969] as well as the similar experience of Shadrach, Mesach, and\r\nAbednego, when they were saved from the wrath of Nebuchadnezzar.[970]\r\nMiraculous interposition of this kind was expected as a matter of\r\ncourse by the early Christians. About the year 400 Rufinus, in his\r\naccount of his visit to the monks of the Nitrian desert, tells an\r\nadventure of the hermit Copres as related to him by that holy man\r\nhimself. On visiting a neighboring city he engaged in a disputation\r\nwith a Manichæan who was perverting the people. Finding the heretic not\r\neasily overcome by argument, he proposed that a fire should be built\r\nin the public square, into which both should enter. The populace was\r\ndelighted with the idea and speedily had a roaring pyre ready, when\r\nthe Manichæan insisted that the Christian should enter first. Copres\r\nassented and remained unhurt in the flames for half an hour; his\r\nantagonist still held back, when the crowd seized him and tossed him\r\ninto the fire, where he was severely scorched, and was ejected with\r\ndisgrace from the city.[971] Almost identical is the story related in\r\n597 A. D., under the Emperor Anastasius, of a Catholic bishop, who,\r\nafter being worsted in a theological dispute by the subtle logic of\r\nan Arian, offered to test the soundness of their respective doctrines\r\nby together entering a blazing fire. The prudent Arian declined the\r\nproposition, when the enthusiastic Catholic jumped into the burning\r\npile, and thence continued the controversy without suffering the least\r\ninconvenience.[972] In the less impressive form of filling the lap\r\nwith burning coals and carrying them uninjured till they grew cold\r\nthis ordeal seems to have been a favorite with holy men accused of\r\nunchastity. It is related of St. Brice, the successor of St. Martin in\r\nthe see of Tours, of St. Simplicius of Autun, and of Montano bishop of\r\nToledo in the sixth century.[973]\r\n\r\nThe earliest legal allusion to this form of ordeal in Europe occurs\r\nin the code of the Ripuarian Franks, where it is prescribed as\r\napplicable to slaves and strangers, in some cases of doubt.[974]\r\nFrom the phraseology of these passages, we may conclude that it was\r\nthen administered by placing the hand of the accused in a fire. As\r\na legal ordeal this is perhaps the only allusion to it in European\r\njurisprudence, but it was repeatedly resorted to by enthusiasts\r\nas a voluntary trial for the purpose of establishing the truth of\r\naccusations or of substantiating their position. In these cases it\r\nwas conducted on a larger and more impressive scale; huge pyres were\r\nbuilt, and the individual undergoing the trial literally walked through\r\nthe flames, as Siawush did. The celebrated Petrus Igneus gained his\r\nsurname and reputation by an exploit of this kind, which was renowned\r\nin its day. Pietro di Pavia, Bishop of Florence, unpopular with the\r\ncitizens, but protected by Godfrey, Duke of Tuscany, was accused of\r\nsimony and heresy. Being acquitted by the Council of Rome, in 1063,\r\nand the offer of his accusers to prove his guilt by the ordeal of\r\nfire being refused, he endeavored to put down his adversaries by\r\ntyranny and oppression. Great disturbances resulted, and at length,\r\nin 1067, the monks of Vallombrosa, who had borne a leading part in\r\ndenouncing the bishop, and who had suffered severely in consequence\r\n(the episcopal troops having burned the monastery of St. Salvio and\r\nslaughtered the cenobites), resolved to decide the question by the\r\nordeal, incited thereto by no less than three thousand enthusiastic\r\nFlorentines who assembled there for the purpose. Pietro Aldobrandini,\r\na monk of Vallombrosa, urged by his superior, the holy S. Giovanni\r\nGualberto, offered himself to undergo the trial. After imposing\r\nreligious ceremonies, he walked slowly between two piles of blazing\r\nwood, ten feet long, five feet wide, and four and a half feet high,\r\nthe passage between them being six feet wide and covered with an inch\r\nor two of glowing coals. The violence of the flames agitated his dress\r\nand hair, but he emerged without hurt, even the hair on his legs being\r\nunsinged, barelegged and barefooted though he was. Desiring to return\r\nthrough the pyre, he was prevented by the admiring crowd, who rushed\r\naround him in triumph, kissing his feet and garments, and endangering\r\nhis life in their transports, until he was rescued by his fellow monks.\r\nA formal statement of the facts was sent to Rome by the Florentines,\r\nthe papal court gave way, and the bishop was deposed; while the monk\r\nwho had given so striking a proof of his steadfast faith was marked for\r\npromotion, and eventually died Cardinal of Albano.[975]\r\n\r\nAn example of a similar nature occurred in Milan in 1103, when\r\nthe Archbishop Grossolano was accused of simony by a priest named\r\nLiutprand, who, having no proof to sustain his charge, offered the\r\nordeal of fire. All the money he could raise he expended in procuring\r\nfuel, and when all was ready the partisans of the archbishop attacked\r\nthe preparations and carried off the wood. The populace, deprived of\r\nthe promised exhibition, grew turbulent, and Grossolano was obliged\r\nnot only to assent to the trial, but to join the authorities in\r\nproviding the necessary materials. In the Piazza di S. Ambrogio two\r\npiles were accordingly built, each ten cubits long, by four cubits in\r\nheight and width, with a gangway between them of a cubit and a half.\r\nAs the undaunted priest entered the blazing mass, the flames divided\r\nbefore him and closed as he passed, allowing him to emerge in safety,\r\nalthough with two slight injuries, one a burn on the hand, received\r\nwhile sprinkling the fire before entering, the other on the foot,\r\nwhich he attributed to a kick from a horse in the crowd that awaited\r\nhis exit. The evidence was accepted as conclusive by the people, and\r\nGrossolano was obliged to retire to Rome. Pascal II., however, received\r\nhim graciously, and the Milanese suffragans disapproved of the summary\r\nconviction of their metropolitan, to which they were probably all\r\nequally liable. The injuries received by Liutprand were exaggerated, a\r\ntumult was excited in Milan, the priest was obliged to seek safety in\r\nflight, and Grossolano was restored for a time, but the adverse party\r\nprevailed and in spite of papal support he was forced to exile.[976]\r\n\r\nA volunteer miracle of somewhat the same character, which is recorded\r\nas occurring in Paris early in the thirteenth century, may be alluded\r\nto as illustrating the belief of the period. A loose woman in the\r\nhousehold of a great noble was luring the youthful retainers to sin,\r\nwhen the chaplain remonstrated with his master, and threatened to\r\ndepart unless she was removed. When she was taxed with her guilt she\r\ndefended herself by saying that the priest had accused her because she\r\nhad refused his importunities, and offered to prove it. Approaching him\r\nas a penitent, she sought to seduce his virtue, finally threatening to\r\nkill herself unless he would gratify her despairing love, until, to\r\nprevent her suicide, he finally made an appointment with her. Secretly\r\nannouncing her triumph to the noble, she went to the place of meeting,\r\nwhere she found the chaplain mounted on a bed of plank, surrounded by\r\nstraw and dry wood, to which he set fire on her appearance, and invited\r\nher to join him. Covered by the flames, the sinless man felt nothing\r\nbut a cool, refreshing breeze, and when the pile had burnt out, he\r\nemerged unhurt, even his garments and hair being untouched.[977]\r\n\r\nBut the experiment was not always so successful for the rash\r\nenthusiast. In 1098, during the first crusade, after the capture of\r\nAntioch, when the Christians were in turn besieged in that city, and,\r\nsorely pressed and famine-struck, were well-nigh reduced to despair,\r\nan ignorant peasant named Peter Bartholomew, a follower of Raymond of\r\nToulouse, announced a series of visions in which St. Andrew and the\r\nSaviour had revealed to him that the lance which pierced the side of\r\nChrist lay hidden in the church of St. Peter. After several men had\r\ndug in the spot indicated, from morning until night, without success,\r\nPeter leaped into the trench, and by a few well-directed strokes of\r\nhis mattock exhumed the priceless relic, which he presented to Count\r\nRaymond. Cheered by this, and by various other manifestations of Divine\r\nassistance, the Christians gained heart, and defeated the Infidels with\r\nimmense slaughter. Peter became a man of mark, and had fresh visions\r\non all important conjunctures. Amid the jealousies and dissensions\r\nwhich raged among the Frankish chiefs, the possession of the holy\r\nlance vastly increased Raymond’s importance, and rival princes were\r\nfound to assert that it was merely a rusty Arab weapon, hidden for the\r\noccasion, and wholly undeserving the veneration of which it was the\r\nobject. At length, after some months, during the leisure of the siege\r\nof Archas, the principal ecclesiastics in the camp investigated the\r\nmatter, and Peter, to silence the doubts expressed as to his veracity,\r\noffered to vindicate the identity of the relic by the fiery ordeal. He\r\nwas taken at his word, and after three days allowed for fasting and\r\nprayer, a pile of dry olive-branches was made, fourteen feet long and\r\nfour feet high, with a passage-way one foot wide. In the presence of\r\nforty thousand men all eagerly awaiting the result, Peter, bearing the\r\nobject in dispute, and clothed only in a tunic, boldly rushed through\r\nthe flames, amid the anxious prayers and adjurations of the multitude.\r\nAs the chroniclers lean to the side of the Neapolitan Princes or of the\r\nCount of Toulouse, so do their accounts of the event differ; the former\r\nasserting that Peter sustained mortal injury in the fire; the latter\r\nassuring us that he emerged safely, with but one or two slight burns,\r\nand that the crowd enthusiastically pressing around him in triumph,\r\nhe was thrown down, trampled on, and injured so severely that he died\r\nin a few days, asseverating with his latest breath the truth of his\r\nrevelations. Raymond persisted in upholding the sanctity of his relic,\r\nbut it was subsequently lost.[978]\r\n\r\nEven after the efforts of Innocent III. to abolish the ordeal, and\r\nwhile the canons of the Council of Lateran were still fresh, St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi, in 1219, offered himself to the flames for the\r\npropagation of the faith. In his missionary trip to the East, finding\r\nthe Soldan deaf to his proselyting eloquence, he proposed to test\r\nthe truth of their respective religions by entering a blazing pile\r\nin company with some imams, who naturally declined the perilous\r\nexperiment. Nothing daunted, the enthusiastic saint then said that he\r\nwould traverse the flames alone if the Soldan would bind himself, in\r\nthe event of a triumphant result, to embrace the Christian religion\r\nand to force his subjects to follow the example. The Turk, more wary\r\nthan the Dane whom Poppo converted, declined the proposition, and St.\r\nFrancis returned from his useless voyage unharmed.[979]\r\n\r\nIn this St. Francis endeavored unsuccessfully to emulate the glorious\r\nachievement of Boniface, the Apostle of Russia, who, according to the\r\ncurrent martyrologies, converted the King of Russia to the true faith\r\nby means of such a bargain and ordeal.[980] It is a little curious that\r\nPeter Cantor, in his diatribe against the judgment of God, presents\r\nthe supposition of a trial such as this as an unanswerable argument\r\nagainst the system—the Church, he says, could not assent to such an\r\nexperiment, and therefore it ought not to be trusted in affairs of less\r\nmagnitude.[981]\r\n\r\nSomewhat irregular as a judicial proceeding, but yet illustrating\r\nthe general belief in the principles of the ordeal of fire, was an\r\noccurrence related about the year 1220 by Cæsarius of Heisterbach as\r\nhaving taken place a few years before in Arras. An ecclesiastic of good\r\nrepute decoyed a goldsmith into his house, and murdered him to obtain\r\npossession of some valuables, cutting up the body, with the assistance\r\nof a younger sister, and hiding the members in a drain. The crime was\r\nproved upon them, and both were condemned to the stake. On the way to\r\nthe place of punishment, the girl demanded a confessor, and confessed\r\nher sins with full contrition, but the brother was obdurate and\r\nimpenitent. Both were tied to the same stake; the brother was promptly\r\nreduced to ashes, while the flames were deliciously cool to the sister,\r\nand only burnt the rope with which she was tied, so that she quietly\r\nwalked down from the pile. The judges, thus convinced of her innocence,\r\ndismissed her without further trouble.[982]\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, however, both as to date and as to\r\nconsequences, the most remarkable recourse to the fire ordeal was\r\nthat which proved to be the proximate cause of the downfall of\r\nSavonarola. Long after the ordeal system had been superseded in\r\nEuropean jurisprudence, and occurring in the centre of the New\r\nLearning, it was a most noteworthy illustration of the superstition\r\nwhich formed a common bond between sceptics and religious enthusiasts.\r\nIn 1498 Savonarola had been silenced by command of Alexander III.,\r\nhis influence with the people was waning, and his faithful follower\r\nFra Domenico da Pescia was desperately struggling in the pulpit to\r\nmaintain the cause against the assaults of the Franciscans led by the\r\neloquent Fra Francesco della Puglia. Domenico in a sermon offered to\r\nprove the truth of his leader’s utterances by throwing himself from\r\nthe roof of the Palazzo de’ Signori, by casting himself in the river,\r\nor by entering fire. This burst of rhetoric might have passed unheeded\r\nhad not Fra Francesco taken it up and offered to share the ordeal\r\nwith Savonarola himself. Savonarola declined, except under impossible\r\nconditions, but Domenico accepted the challenge and affixed to the\r\nportal of Santa Croce a paper in which he offered to prove by argument\r\nor miracle the truth of sundry propositions bearing upon his teacher’s\r\nmission. To this Fra Francesco replied that he would enter fire with\r\nFra Domenico; that he fully expected to be burnt, but that he would\r\nwillingly suffer if he could disabuse the people of their false idol.\r\nPopular excitement rose to such a height that the Signoria sent for\r\nboth disputants, and made them sign a written agreement to undergo\r\nthe ordeal. In this Fra Francesco wisely provided that, although he\r\nwas willing to enter fire with Savonarola himself, if Domenico was to\r\nact he would only produce a champion, who was readily found in the\r\nperson of Fra Giuliano Rondinelli. On the side of the Dominicans the\r\nenthusiasm was so great that all the friars of Savonarola’s convent of\r\nSan Marco, nearly three hundred in number, eagerly signed a pledge to\r\nsubmit to the ordeal, and he assured them that in such a cause they\r\ncould do so without danger. In fact, when, on the day before the trial,\r\nhe preached on the subject in San Marco, the whole audience rose as\r\none man and offered to take Domenico’s place.\r\n\r\nApril 7th was the day fixed for the _Sperimento del Fuoco_. In the\r\nPiazza de’ Signori a huge pile of wood, plentifully reinforced with\r\ngunpowder, sulphur, oil, and spirits, was built with a gangway through\r\nwhich the champions were to pass; it was to be lighted at one end,\r\nand after they entered fire was to be set at the other to preclude\r\nretreat. All Florence assembled to witness the spectacle, and patiently\r\nendured the peltings of a terrible storm. The day was spent, however,\r\nin wrangling over questions skilfully raised by the Franciscans,\r\nthe chief one being whether Fra Domenico should carry in his hand a\r\nconsecrated host. It had been revealed to one of his brethren that this\r\nwas indispensable, and Savonarola adhered to it firmly. When evening\r\ncame the Signoria announced that the ordeal was abandoned. The crowd\r\nwas enraged at the loss of the promised exhibition; the Dominicans had\r\nso confidently promised a miracle that the drawn battle was universally\r\nregarded as their defeat, an armed guard was required to protect their\r\nreturn to their convent, and Savonarola’s power over the Florentine\r\npopulace was gone. His enemies lost no time in pushing their advantage.\r\nThe next evening the mob assailed San Marco; he was seized and conveyed\r\nto prison, and after prolonged and repeated tortures he was hanged and\r\nburnt on May 23d.[983]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the ordeal of fire was principally affected\r\nby ecclesiastics in church affairs, perhaps because it was of a nature\r\nto produce a powerful impression on the spectators, while at the same\r\ntime it could no doubt in many instances be so managed as to secure\r\nthe desired results by those who controlled the details. In like\r\nmanner, it was occasionally employed on inanimate matter to decide\r\npoints of faith or polity. Thus, in the question which excited great\r\ncommotion in Spain, in 1077, as to the substitution of the Roman for\r\nthe Gothic or Mozarabic rite, after a judicial combat had been fought\r\nand determined in favor of the national ritual, the partisans of the\r\nRoman offices continued to urge their cause, and the ordeal of fire\r\nwas appealed to. A missal of each kind was committed to the flames,\r\nand, to the great joy of all patriotic Castilians, the Gothic offices\r\nwere unconsumed.[984] More satisfactory to the orthodox was the result\r\nof a similar ordeal during the efforts of St. Dominic to convert the\r\nAlbigenses. In a dispute with some heretics he wrote out his argument\r\non the points of faith, and gave it to them for examination and\r\nreply. That night, as they were seated around the hearth, the paper\r\nwas produced and read, when one of them proposed that it should be\r\ncast into the flames, when, if it remained unconsumed, they would see\r\nthat its contents were true. This was promptly done, when the saintly\r\ndocument was unharmed. One, more obstinate than the rest, asked for a\r\nsecond and then for a third trial, with the same result. The perverse\r\nheretics, however, closed their hearts against the truth, and bound\r\nthemselves by oath to keep the affair secret; and so glorious a\r\nvictory for the true faith would have remained unknown but for the\r\nindiscretion of one of them, a knight, who had a covert inclination\r\ntowards orthodoxy.[985] A somewhat similar instance occurred in\r\nConstantinople as late as the close of the thirteenth century, when\r\nAndronicus II., on his accession, found the city torn into factions\r\nrelative to the patriarchate, arising from the expulsion of Arsenius,\r\na former patriarch. All attempts to soothe the dissensions proving\r\nvain, at length both parties agreed to write out their respective\r\nstatements and arguments, and, committing both books to the flames,\r\nto abide by the result, each side hoping that its manuscript would be\r\npreserved by the special interposition of Heaven. The ceremony was\r\nconducted with imposing state, and, to the general surprise, both books\r\nwere reduced to ashes. Singularly enough, all parties united in the\r\nsensible conclusion that God had thereby commanded them to forget their\r\ndifferences and to live in peace.[986]\r\n\r\nAbout the same period as this last example, Samaritan tradition related\r\nthat the comparative claims of Mt. Gerizim and Al-Qods (Jerusalem) as\r\nthe sole seats of Yahveh-worship were settled before Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nby the ordeal of fire, applied respectively to the Pentateuch and to\r\nthe later books of the Jewish canon, Sanballat appearing for Ephraim,\r\nand Zerubbabel for Judah. The later books were promptly consumed, but\r\nthe law of Moses emerged twice from the flames unhurt. Zerubbabel, in\r\ndespair, then spat upon some pages of the index, and cast the Law a\r\nthird time into the fire, when the leaves thus polluted were burnt,\r\nbut the book itself leaped unscathed into the bosom of the king, who\r\npromptly slew the representatives of Judah, and gave an unhesitating\r\nverdict in favor of the Samaritans.[987]\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of relics was often tested in this manner by exposing\r\nthem to the action of fire. This custom, like the ordeal itself as\r\na judicial process, finds its original home in the East. When, for\r\ninstance, the sacred tooth-relic of Buddha was carried to the court\r\nof King Pandu at Patali-putta, and its holiness was questioned by the\r\nNiganthas, or worshippers of Siva, they tested it by casting it into\r\na pit filled with glowing charcoal “bright and horrid as the hell\r\nRoruva”—when the tooth, in place of being consumed to ashes, rose out\r\nof the fiery mass resting on a lotus the size of a chariot-wheel.[988]\r\nEven Roman unbelief accepted a similar faith respecting the superfluous\r\nthumb which ornamented the right foot of King Pyrrhus, the touch of\r\nwhich cured diseases of the spleen, and which remained unharmed\r\non the funeral pyre which consumed the rest of his body to ashes.\r\nThe indestructible supplementary member was thereupon inclosed in a\r\ncasket, and reverently placed in a temple—the first relic, probably,\r\non record in the western world.[989] At how early an age Christianity\r\nadopted the belief which led to this is manifested by the story of the\r\nswaddling-cloth of Christ in one of the apocryphal Gospels. The Virgin,\r\nbeing unable, on account of poverty, to make a return for the offerings\r\nof the Magi who came to worship the infant Saviour, presented them\r\nwith one of his swaddling-bands. On their return they placed it in the\r\nsacred fire of their altar, and though the flames eagerly embraced it,\r\nthey left it unharmed and unaltered, whereupon the Magi venerated it,\r\nand laid it away among their treasures.[990] On the conversion of the\r\nSpanish Arians the experiment was tried on a larger scale. It seems\r\nthat doubts were felt by the orthodox as to the relics preserved in\r\ntheir churches, and a general regulation was adopted by the Council of\r\nSaragossa in 592 that they should be all brought before the bishops and\r\ntested by fire—with what result is not recorded.[991]\r\n\r\nIn such cases the ceremony of the ordeal was conducted with appropriate\r\nreligious services, including the following prayer, which would seem\r\nto show that in its regular form it was not the relic itself, but the\r\ncloth in which it was wrapped that was exposed to the test—\r\n\r\n Lord Jesus Christ, who art king of kings and lord of lords, and lover\r\n of all believers in thee, who art a just judge, strong and powerful,\r\n who hast revealed thy holy mysteries to thy priests, and who didst\r\n mitigate the flames to the Three Children; concede to us thy unworthy\r\n servants and grant our prayers that this cloth or this thread in which\r\n are wrapped those bodies of saints, if they are not genuine let them\r\n be burned by this fire, and if they are genuine let them escape, so\r\n that iniquity shall not prevail over injustice but falsehood shall\r\n succumb to truth, so that thy truth shall be declared to thee and be\r\n manifested to us, believers in thee, that we may know thee to be the\r\n blessed God in ages everlasting. Amen.[992]\r\n\r\nNumerous instances of this superiority of relics to fire are narrated\r\nby the pious chroniclers of the middle ages. In 1015 some monastic\r\npilgrims, hospitably received at Monte Cassino on their return from\r\nJerusalem, offered at the shrine of St. Benedict a fragment of the\r\ntowel with which the Saviour had washed the feet of his disciples.\r\nSome of the monks, being incredulous, placed it on burning coals, when\r\nit turned fiery red, but, on being removed, returned to its original\r\ncolor, and all doubts as to its authenticity were dispelled.[993]\r\nWhen, in 1065, the pious Egelwin, Bishop of Durham, miraculously\r\ndiscovered the relics of the holy martyr King Oswyn, he gave the hair\r\nto Judith, wife of Tosti, Earl of Northumberland, and she with all\r\nreverence placed it on a raging fire, whence it was withdrawn, not\r\nonly uninjured, but marvellously increased in lustre, to the great\r\nedification of all beholders.[994] A similar miracle attested the\r\nsanctity of King Olaf the Saint, of Norway, when his hair was laid on\r\na pan of live coals, consecrated by Bishop Grimkel, to satisfy the\r\nincredulity of Queen Alfifa.[995] Guibert de Nogent likewise relates\r\nthat, when his native town became honored with the possession of an\r\narm of St. Arnoul, the inhabitants, at first doubting the genuineness\r\nof the precious relic, cast it into the flames; when it vindicated its\r\nsanctity, not only by being fireproof, but also by leaping briskly away\r\nfrom the coals, testimony which was held to be incontrovertible.[996]\r\nThe historian of the monastery of Andres informs us that when in 1084\r\nthe long-lost remains of the holy virgin Rotruda were miraculously\r\nfound, and Baldwin I., Count of Guisnes, desired to take the sacred\r\ntreasure to his town of Guisnes, it refused to be removed until\r\nhe proposed to place it on a wagon and allow a team of oxen to be\r\ndivinely guided to the spot where the saint desired to rest. This was\r\naccordingly done, and the oxen carried the relics to a little chapel\r\ndedicated to St. Medard, where steps were immediately taken to found\r\nan abbey. The Seigneur of Andres, however, Baldwin Bochard, on whose\r\nlands the chapel lay, foreseeing that a powerful monastery would be\r\na troublesome neighbor, and being an irreligious man, circulated\r\ndefamatory libels impugning the authenticity of the relics, and finally\r\npersuaded Count Baldwin to have them tested by the ordeal of fire.\r\nThis was accordingly done, and the genuineness of the holy remains\r\nwas proved to the satisfaction of all. Bochard and his descendants\r\ncontinued inveterately hostile to St. Rotruda and her monks, but all,\r\nwithout exception, were compelled, upon their death-beds, to contribute\r\na portion of their substance to her honor.[997] The custom continued\r\neven until the sixteenth century was well advanced. In the Jeronymite\r\nmonastery of Valdebran in Catalonia, a piece of the true cross bears\r\ninscription that its genuineness was tested with fire by Archbishop\r\nMiralles on October 2, 1530.[998]\r\n\r\nThe persistency of popular belief in this method of ascertaining guilt\r\nor innocence is seen as recently as 1811, when a Neapolitan noble,\r\nsuspecting the chastity of his daughter, exposed her to the ordeal of\r\nfire, from which she barely escaped with her life.[999]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF COLD WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cold-water ordeal (_judicium aquæ frigidæ_) differed from most of\r\nits congeners in requiring a miracle to convict the accused, as in\r\nthe natural order of things he escaped. The preliminary solemnities,\r\nfasting, prayer, and religious rites, were similar to those already\r\ndescribed; holy water sometimes was given to the accused to drink;\r\nthe reservoir of water, or pond, was then exorcised with formulas\r\nexhibiting the same combination of faith and impiety, and the accused,\r\nbound with cords, was slowly lowered into it with a rope, to prevent\r\nfraud if guilty, and to save him from drowning if innocent.[1000]\r\nAccording to Anglo-Saxon rule, the length of rope allowed under water\r\nwas an ell and a half;[1001] in one ritual it is directed that a\r\nknot be made in the rope at a distance of a long hair from the body\r\nof the accused, and if he sinks so as to bring the knot down to the\r\nsurface of the water, he is cleared;[1002] but in process of time nice\r\nquestions arose as to the precise amount of submergence requisite\r\nfor acquittal. Towards the close of the twelfth century we find that\r\nsome learned doctors insisted that sinking to the very bottom of the\r\nwater was indispensable; others decided that if the whole person were\r\nsubmerged it was sufficient; while others again reasoned that as the\r\nhair was an accident or excrement of the body, it had the privilege\r\nof floating without convicting its owner, if the rest of the body was\r\nsatisfactorily covered.[1003]\r\n\r\nThe basis of this ordeal was the belief, handed down from the primitive\r\nAryans, that the pure element would not receive into its bosom any one\r\nstained with the crime of a false oath, another form of which is seen\r\nin the ancient superstition that the earth would eject the corpse of a\r\ncriminal, and not allow it to remain quietly interred. The manner in\r\nwhich the church reconciled it to orthodoxy is clearly set forth by\r\nHincmar: “He who seeks to conceal the truth by a lie will not sink in\r\nthe waters over which the voice of the Lord hath thundered; for the\r\npure nature of water recognizes as impure, and rejects as incompatible,\r\nhuman nature which, released from falsehood by the waters of baptism,\r\nbecomes again infected with untruth.”[1004] The baptism in the Jordan,\r\nthe passage of the Red Sea, and the crowning judgment of the Deluge,\r\nwere freely adduced in support of this theory, though these latter\r\nwere in direct contradiction to it; and the most figurative language\r\nwas boldly employed to give some show of probability to the results\r\nexpected. Thus, in the elaborate formula which passes under the name\r\nof St. Dunstan, the prayer offered over the water metaphorically\r\nadjures the Supreme Being—“Let not the water receive the body of him\r\nwho, released from the weight of goodness, is upborne by the wind of\r\niniquity!”[1005]\r\n\r\nIn India the ordeal of cold water became simply one of endurance. The\r\nstream or pond was exorcised with the customary Mantras:—\r\n\r\n “Thou O water dwellest in the interior of all things like a witness. O\r\n water thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.\r\n\r\n “This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared from guilt.\r\n Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.”\r\n\r\nThe patient stood in water up to his middle, facing the East, caught\r\nhold of the thighs of a man “free from friendship or hatred” and dived\r\nunder, while simultaneously an arrow of reed without a head was shot\r\nfrom a bow, 106 fingers’ breadth in length, and if he could remain\r\nunder water until the arrow was picked up and brought back, he gained\r\nhis cause, but if any portion of him could be seen above the surface\r\nhe was condemned. Yajnavalkya says this form of ordeal was only used\r\non the Sudras, or lowest caste, while the Ayeen Akbery speaks of it\r\nas confined to the Vaisyas, or caste of husbandmen and merchants.\r\nAccording to the Institutes of Vishnu, it was not to be administered to\r\nthe timid or those affected with lung diseases, nor to those who gained\r\ntheir living by the water, such as fishermen or boatmen, nor was it\r\nallowed during the winter.[1006]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have seen (p. 268), the original cold-water ordeal in\r\nIndia, as described by Manu, was precisely similar to the European\r\nform, inasmuch as the guilty were expected to float and the innocent\r\nto sink, and although in this shape it prevailed everywhere throughout\r\nEurope, and its tenacity of existence rendered it the last to disappear\r\nin the progress of civilization, yet it does not make its appearance in\r\nany of the earlier codes of the Barbarians. The first allusions to it\r\noccur in the ninth century, and it was then so generally regarded as\r\na novelty that documents almost contemporaneous ascribe its invention\r\nto the popes of that period. One story is that when Leo III. fled in\r\n799 from his rebellious subjects to Charlemagne, and returned to Rome\r\nunder the latter’s protection, the cold-water ordeal was introduced\r\nfor the purpose of trying the rebels or recovering a treasure which\r\nthey had stolen.[1007] Another version asserts that Eugenius II., who\r\noccupied the pontifical throne from 824 to 827, invented it at the\r\nrequest of Louis le Débonnaire, for the purpose of repressing the\r\nprevalent sin of perjury.[1008] It is further worthy of note that St.\r\nAgobard, Archbishop of Lyons, in his treatises against the judgments\r\nof God, written a few years before the accession of Eugenius, while\r\nenumerating and describing the various methods in use at that time,\r\nsays nothing about that of cold water.[1009] But for the evidence of\r\nits pre-existence in the East, we therefore should be justified in\r\nassuming that it was an innovation invented by the Church of the ninth\r\ncentury. That it was a novelty is proved by the necessity felt to\r\nadduce authority for its use.[1010]\r\n\r\nAt first, its revival promised to be but temporary. Only a few years\r\nafter its introduction it was condemned by Louis le Débonnaire at the\r\nCouncil of Worms, in 829; its use was strictly prohibited, and the\r\n_missi dominici_ were instructed to see that the order was carried into\r\neffect, regulations which were repeated by the Emperor Lothair, son of\r\nLouis.[1011] These interdictions were of little avail. The ordeal found\r\nfavor with popular superstition, and Hincmar contents himself with\r\nremarking that the imperial prohibition was not confirmed by the canons\r\nof authoritative councils.[1012] The trial by cold water spread rapidly\r\nthroughout Europe, and by all the continental races it was placed on an\r\nequal footing with the other forms of ordeal. Among the Anglo-Saxons,\r\nindeed, its employment has been called in question by some modern\r\nwriters; but the Dooms of Ethelstan sufficiently manifest its existence\r\nin England before the Conquest, while as late as the close of the\r\ntwelfth century its use would seem to have been almost universal. The\r\nassizes of Clarendon in 1166, confirmed at Northampton in 1176, direct\r\nan inquest to be held in each shire, and all who are indicted for\r\nmurder, robbery, harboring of malefactors, and other felonies are to\r\nbe at once, without further trial, passed through the water ordeal to\r\ndetermine their guilt or innocence.[1013]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the case of the iron ordeal, those of water, both\r\ncold and hot, were variously described as patrician or plebeian in\r\ndifferent times and places. Thus Hincmar, in the ninth century,\r\nalludes to the water ordeals as applicable to persons of servile\r\ncondition;[1014] a constitution of the Emperor St. Henry II., about\r\nA. D. 1000, in the Lombard law, has a similar bearing;[1015] in the\r\neleventh century an Alsatian document,[1016] in the twelfth Glanville’s\r\ntreatise on the laws of England,[1017] and in the thirteenth the laws\r\nof Scotland[1018] all assume the same position. This, however, was an\r\ninnovation; for in the earliest codes there was no such distinction,\r\na provision in the Salic law prescribing the _æneum_, or hot-water\r\nordeal, even for the Antrustions, who constituted the most favored\r\nclass in the state.[1019] Nor even in later times was the rule by any\r\nmeans absolute. In the tenth century, Sanche, Duke of Gascony, desirous\r\nof founding the monastery of Saint Sever, claimed some land which\r\nwas necessary for the purpose, and being resisted by the possessor,\r\nthe title was decided by reference to the cold-water ordeal.[1020]\r\nIn 1027, Welf II., Count of Altorf, ancestor of the great houses of\r\nGuelf in Italy and England, having taken part in the revolt of Conrad\r\nthe Younger and Ernest of Suabia, was forced by the Emperor Conrad\r\nthe Salic to prove his innocence in this manner.[1021] About the same\r\nperiod Othlonus relates an incident in which a man of noble birth\r\naccused of theft submitted himself to the cold-water ordeal as a matter\r\nof course;[1022] while in 1068, at the Council of Vich, in Catalonia,\r\nheld for the purpose of enforcing the Truce of God, all persons\r\naccused of being directly concerned in its violation are directed to\r\nbe tried by the cold-water ordeal in the Church of San Pedro, without\r\ndistinction of rank.[1023] Nearly two centuries later, indeed, when\r\nall the vulgar ordeals were falling into disuse, the water ordeal\r\nwas established among the nobles of Southern Germany, as the mode of\r\ndeciding doubtful claims on fiefs, and in Northern Germany, for the\r\nsettlement of conflicting titles to land.[1024]\r\n\r\nIn 1083, during the deadly struggle between the Empire and the Papacy,\r\nas personified in Henry IV. and Hildebrand, the imperialists related\r\nwith great delight that some of the leading prelates of the papal court\r\nsubmitted the cause of their chief to this ordeal. After a three days’\r\nfast, and proper benediction of the water, they placed in it a boy to\r\nrepresent the emperor, when to their horror he sank like a stone. On\r\nreferring the result to Hildebrand, he ordered a repetition of the\r\nexperiment, which was attended with the same result. Then, throwing him\r\nin as a representative of the pope, he obstinately floated during two\r\ntrials, in spite of all efforts to force him under the surface, and an\r\noath was exacted from all concerned to maintain inviolable secrecy as\r\nto the unexpected result.[1025]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extensive instance of the application of this form of\r\nordeal was that proposed when the sacred vessels were stolen from the\r\ncathedral church of Laon, as related by a contemporary. At a council\r\nconvened on the subject, Master Anselm, the most learned doctor of the\r\ndiocese, suggested that, in imitation of the plan adopted by Joshua\r\nat Jericho, a young child should be taken from each parish of the\r\ntown and be tried by immersion in consecrated water. From each house\r\nof the parish which should be found guilty, another child should be\r\nchosen to undergo the same process. When the house of the criminal\r\nshould thus be discovered, all its inmates should be submitted to the\r\nordeal, and the author of the sacrilege would thus be revealed. This\r\nplan would have been adopted had not the frightened inhabitants rushed\r\nto the bishop and insisted that the experiment should commence with\r\nthose whose access to the church gave them the best opportunity to\r\nperpetrate the theft. Six of these latter were accordingly selected,\r\namong whom was Anselm himself. While in prison awaiting his trial,\r\nhe caused himself to be bound hand and foot and placed in a tub full\r\nof water, in which he sank satisfactorily to the bottom, and assured\r\nhimself that he should escape. On the day of trial, in the presence of\r\nan immense crowd, in the cathedral which was chosen as the place of\r\njudgment, the first prisoner sank, the second floated, the third sank,\r\nthe fourth floated, the fifth sank, and Anselm, who was the sixth,\r\nnotwithstanding his previous experiment, obstinately floated, and was\r\ncondemned with his accomplices, in spite of his earnest protestations\r\nof innocence.[1026]\r\n\r\nAlthough the cold-water ordeal disappears from the statute-book in\r\ncivil and in ordinary criminal actions together with its kindred modes\r\nof purgation, there was one class of cases in which it maintained\r\nits hold upon the popular faith to a much later period. These were\r\nthe accusations of sorcery and witchcraft which form so strange a\r\nfeature of mediæval and modern society; and its use for this purpose\r\nmay apparently be traced to various causes. For such crimes, drowning\r\nwas the punishment inflicted by the customs of the Franks, as soon\r\nas they had lost the respect for individual liberty of action which\r\nexcluded personal punishments from their original code;[1027] and\r\nin addition to the general belief that the pure element refused to\r\nreceive those who were tainted with crime, there was in this special\r\nclass of cases a widely spread superstition that adepts in sorcery\r\nand magic lost their specific gravity. Pliny mentions a race of\r\nenchanters on the Euxine who were lighter than water—“eosdem præterea\r\nnon posse mergi ne veste quidam degravatos;”[1028] and Stephanus\r\nByzantinus describes the inhabitants of Thebe as magicians who could\r\nkill with their breath, and floated when thrown into the sea.[1029] To\r\nthe concurrence of these notions we may attribute the fact that when\r\nthe cold-water ordeal was abandoned, in the thirteenth century, as a\r\njudicial practice in ordinary cases, it still maintained its place as a\r\nspecial mode of trying those unfortunate persons whom their own folly,\r\nor the malice and fears of their neighbors, pointed out as witches\r\nand sorcerers.[1030] No less than a hundred years after the efforts\r\nof Innocent III. had virtually put an end to all the other forms of\r\nvulgar ordeals, we find Louis Hutin ordering its employment in these\r\ncases.[1031] At length, however, it fell into desuetude, until the\r\nsuperstitious panic of witchcraft which took possession of the popular\r\nmind caused its revival in the second half of the sixteenth century.\r\nIn 1487, Sprenger, while treating of every possible detail concerning\r\nwitchcraft and its prosecution, and alluding to the red-hot iron\r\nordeal, makes no reference whatever to cold water or to the faculty\r\nof floating possessed by witches, thus showing that it had passed\r\ncompletely out of remembrance as a test in these cases, both popularly\r\nand judicially.[1032] In 1564, Wier discusses it as though it were in\r\nordinary use in Western Germany, and mentions a recent case wherein\r\na young girl falsely accused was tested in this manner and floated,\r\nafter which she was tortured until the executioner himself wondered at\r\nher power of endurance. As no confession could be extracted, she was\r\ndischarged, which shows how little real confidence was reposed in the\r\nordeal.[1033] Twenty years later, Scribonius, writing in 1583, speaks\r\nof it as a novelty, but Neuwald assures us that for eighteen years\r\nprevious it had been generally employed throughout Westphalia,[1034]\r\nand in 1579 Bodin alludes to it as a German fashion which, though he\r\nbelieves in its efficacy, he yet condemns as savoring of magic.[1035]\r\nThe crime was one so difficult to prove judicially, and the ordeal\r\noffered so ready and so satisfactory a solution to the doubts of timid\r\nand conscientious judges, that its resuscitation is not to be wondered\r\nat. The professed demonographers, Bodin, Binsfeld, Godelmann, and\r\nothers, opposed its revival for various reasons, but still it did not\r\nlack defenders. In 1583, Scribonius, on a visit to Lemgow, saw three\r\nunfortunates burnt as witches, and three other women, the same day,\r\nexposed to the ordeal on the accusation of those executed. He describes\r\nthem as stripped naked, hands and feet bound together, right to left,\r\nand then cast upon the river, where they floated like logs of wood.\r\nProfoundly impressed with the miracle, in a letter to the magistrates\r\nof Lemgow he expresses his warm approbation of the proceeding,\r\nand endeavors to explain its rationale, and to defend it against\r\nunbelievers. Sorcerers, from their intercourse with Satan, partake of\r\nhis nature; he resides within them, and their human attributes become\r\naltered to his; he is an imponderable spirit of air, and therefore they\r\nlikewise become lighter than water. Two years later, Hermann Neuwald\r\npublished a tract in answer to this, gravely confuting the arguments\r\nadvanced by Scribonius, who, in 1588, returned to the attack with a\r\nlarger and more elaborate treatise in favor of the ordeal. Shortly\r\nafter this, Bishop Binsfeld, in his exhaustive work on witchcraft,\r\nstates that the process was one in common use throughout Westphalia,\r\nand occasionally employed in the Rhinelands. He condemns it, however,\r\non the score of superstition, and the prohibition of all ordeals by\r\nthe popes, and concludes that any judge making use of it, or any one\r\nbelieving in it, is guilty of mortal sin. Rejecting the explanation\r\nof Scribonius, he argues that the floating of the witch is caused\r\nby the direct interposition of the Devil himself, who is willing to\r\nsacrifice a follower occasionally in order to damn the souls of those\r\nwho participate in a practice condemned by the Church.[1036] Wier,\r\nwho denied witchcraft, while believing in the active interposition\r\nof the Devil, argues likewise that those who float are borne up by\r\ndemons, but he attributes it to their desire to confirm the popular\r\nillusions concerning witchcraft.[1037] Another demonographer of the\r\nperiod, Godelmann, does not hesitate to say that any judge resorting\r\nto this mode of proof rendered himself liable to a retaliatory action;\r\nand he substantiates his opinion as to the worthlessness of the trial\r\nby a case within his own experience. In 1588 he was travelling from\r\nPrussia to Livonia, when at the castle of a great potentate his host\r\nhappened to mention that he had condemned a most wicked witch to be\r\nburnt the next day. Godelmann, desirous to know whether the proof\r\ncould be relied on, asked whether the water ordeal had been tried,\r\nand on being answered in the negative, urged the experiment. His\r\nrequest was granted, and the witch sank like a stone. Subsequently the\r\nnoble wrote to him that he had tried it with six other indubitable\r\nwitches, and that it had failed with all, showing that it was a false\r\nindication, which might deceive incautious judges.[1038] Oldenkop, on\r\nthe other hand, relates that he was present when some suspected women\r\nwere tried in this manner, who all floated, after which one of the\r\nspectators, wholly innocent of the crime, to satisfy the curiosity of\r\nsome nobles who were present, allowed himself for hire to be tied and\r\nthrown in, when he likewise floated and could not be made to sink by\r\nall the efforts of the officiating executioner.[1039] In 1594, a more\r\nauthoritative combatant entered the arena—Jacob Rickius, a learned\r\njurisconsult of Cologne, who, as judge in the court of Bonn, had ample\r\nopportunity of considering the question and of putting his convictions\r\ninto practice. He describes vividly the perplexities of the judges\r\nhesitating between the enormity of the crime and the worthlessness of\r\nthe evidence, and his elaborate discussions of all the arguments in\r\nfavor of the ordeal may be condensed into this: that the offence is\r\nso difficult of proof that there is no other certain evidence than\r\nthe ordeal; that without it we should be destitute of absolute proof,\r\nwhich would be an admission of the superiority of the Devil over\r\nGod, and that anything would be preferable to such a conclusion. He\r\nstates that he never administered it when the evidence without it was\r\nsufficient for conviction, nor when there was not enough other proof to\r\njustify the use of torture; and that in all cases it was employed as a\r\nprelude to torture—“præparandum et muniendum torturæ viam”—the latter\r\nbeing frequently powerless in consequence of diabolical influences.\r\nThe deplorable examples which he details with much complacency as\r\nirrefragable proofs of his positions show how frequent and how\r\nmurderous were the cases of its employment, but would occupy too much\r\nspace for recapitulation here; while the learning displayed in his\r\nconstant citations from the Scriptures, the Fathers, the Roman and the\r\nCanon Law, is in curious contrast with the fatuous cruelty of his acts\r\nand doctrines.\r\n\r\nIn France, the central power had to be invoked to put an end to the\r\natrocity of such proceedings. In 1588, an appeal was taken to the\r\nsupreme tribunal from a sentence pronounced by a Champenois court,\r\nordering a prisoner to undergo the experiment, and the Parlement, in\r\nDecember, 1601, registered a formal decree against the practice; an\r\norder which it found necessary to repeat, August 10, 1641.[1040] That\r\nthis latter was not uncalled for, we may assume from the testimony of\r\nJerôme Bignon, who, writing nearly at the same time, says that, to\r\nhis own knowledge, within a few years, judges were in the habit of\r\nelucidating doubtful cases in this manner.[1041] In England, James I.\r\ngratified at once his conceit and his superstition by eulogizing the\r\nordeal as an infallible proof in such cases. His argument was the old\r\none, which pronounced that the pure element would not receive those who\r\nhad renounced the privileges of the water of baptism,[1042] and his\r\nauthority no doubt gave encouragement to innumerable judicial murders.\r\nIn Scotland, indeed, the indecency of stripping women naked for the\r\nimmersion was avoided by wrapping them up in a sheet before binding\r\nthe thumbs and toes together, but a portion of the Bay of St. Andrews\r\nis still called the “Witch Pool,” from its use in the trial of these\r\nunfortunates.[1043]\r\n\r\nHow slowly the belief was eradicated from the minds of even the\r\neducated and enlightened may be seen in a learned inaugural thesis\r\npresented by J. P. Lang, in 1661, for the Licentiate of Laws in the\r\nUniversity of Bâle, in which, discussing incidentally the question\r\nof the cold-water ordeal for witches, he concludes that perhaps\r\nit is better to abstain from it, though he cannot question its\r\nefficaciousness as a means of investigation.[1044] In 1662, N. Brant,\r\nin a similar thesis, offered at Giessen, speaks of it as used in some\r\nplaces, chiefly in Westphalia, and argues against it on the ground\r\nof its uncertainty.[1045] P. Burgmeister, in a thesis presented at\r\nUlm in 1680, speaks of the practice as still continued in Westphalia,\r\nand that it was defended by many learned men, from whose opinions he\r\ndissents; among them was Hermann Conring, one of the most distinguished\r\nscholars of the time, who argued that if prayers and oaths could obtain\r\nthe divine interposition, it could reasonably be expected in judicial\r\ncases of importance.[1046] Towards the close of the century it was\r\nfrequently practised in Burgundy, not as a judicial process, but when\r\npersons popularly reputed as sorcerers desired to free themselves from\r\nthe damaging imputation. In these cases they are frequently reported\r\nas floating in spite of repeated efforts to submerge them, and though\r\nthis evidence of guilt did not lead to a formal trial they would have\r\nto abandon the neighborhood. A notarial act of June 5, 1696, records\r\nsuch a trial at Montigny-le-Roi, when six persons offered themselves\r\nto the ordeal in the River Senin; two sank and four floated for\r\nabout half an hour, with hands and feet tied.[1047] F. M. Brahm, in\r\n1701, alludes to the ordeal as no longer in use;[1048] but in 1714,\r\nJ. C. Nehring describes it as nearly, though not quite obsolete, and\r\nconsiders it worthy of an elaborate discussion. He disapproves of it,\r\nthough he records a case which occurred a few years previously, in\r\nwhich a woman accused of witchcraft managed to escape from her chains,\r\nand went into the water to try herself, and could not be submerged.\r\nNotwithstanding this he declares that even when a prisoner demands the\r\nordeal, the judge who grants it is guilty of mortal sin, for the Devil\r\noften promises witches to save them in this manner, and, though he very\r\nrarely keeps his promise, still he thus succeeds in retaining men in\r\nsuperstitious observances. The success of the ordeal thus is uncertain,\r\nand his conclusion is that laws must be made for the generality of\r\ncases, and not for exceptional ones.[1049] In 1730 thirteen persons\r\nwere exposed to the cold-water ordeal at Szegedin, in Hungary, and\r\nthough their guilt was proved by it, any remaining doubts were settled\r\nby submitting them to the balance;[1050] and five years later Ephraim\r\nGerhardt alludes to it as everywhere in daily use in such cases.[1051]\r\nEven in the middle of the century, the learned and pious Muratori\r\naffirms his reverent belief in the miraculous convictions recorded by\r\nthe mediæval writers as wrought in this manner by the judgment of God;\r\nand he further informs us that it was common in his time throughout\r\nTransylvania, where witches were very numerous;[1052] while in West\r\nPrussia, as late as 1745, the Synod of Culm describes it as a popular\r\nabuse in frequent use, and stringently forbids it for the future.[1053]\r\n\r\nAlthough, within the last hundred years, the cold-water ordeal has\r\ndisappeared from the authorized legal procedures of Europe, still the\r\npopular mind has not as yet altogether overcome the superstitions and\r\nprejudices of so many ages, and occasionally in some benighted spot\r\na case occurs to show us that mediæval ignorance and brutality still\r\nlinger amid the triumphs of modern civilization. In 1815 and 1816,\r\nBelgium was disgraced by trials of the kind performed on unfortunates\r\nsuspected of witchcraft;[1054] and in 1836, the populace of Hela,\r\nnear Dantzic, twice plunged into the sea an old woman reputed to be a\r\nsorceress, and as the miserable creature persisted in rising to the\r\nsurface, she was pronounced guilty, and was beaten to death.[1055] Even\r\nin England it is not many years since a party of credulous people were\r\nprosecuted for employing the water ordeal in the trial of a woman whom\r\nthey believed to be a witch.[1056]\r\n\r\nIn Montenegro and Herzegovina the practice continued till the middle of\r\nthe present century. Any unusual mortality of children was attributed\r\nto sorcery by women: in such cases the head of a village assembled\r\nall the men and exhorted them to bring next morning their wives and\r\nmothers to the nearest water—a lake or a river, or if necessary a well.\r\nThe women were then examined one by one, by passing a rope under the\r\narms and tossing them in, without divesting them of their clothes.\r\nThose who were so ill-advised as not to sink were pronounced guilty,\r\nand were liable to lapidation if they would not swear to abandon their\r\nevil practices. The belief even extended to the dominant Turks who, in\r\n1857 at Trebinje, compelled the Christians to bring all their women to\r\nthe river and cast them in. Buoyed up by their garments seven floated,\r\nand these were only saved from stoning by the archimandrite Eustache,\r\nwho administered to them a solemn oath of abstinence from witchcraft.\r\nAustrian domination has rendered all such proceedings unlawful of\r\nlate years, but in the remoter districts they are said to be still\r\noccasionally practised.[1057]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may class as a remnant of this superstition a custom\r\ndescribed by a modern traveller as universal in Southern Russia. When\r\na theft is committed in a household, the servants are assembled, and\r\na sorceress, or _vorogeia_, is sent for. Dread of what is to follow\r\ngenerally extorts a confession from the guilty party without further\r\nproceedings, but if not, the _vorogeia_ places on the table a vase of\r\nwater and rolls up as many little balls of bread as there are suspected\r\npersons present. Then, taking one of the balls, she addresses the\r\nnearest servant—“If you have committed the theft, this ball will sink\r\nto the bottom of the vase, as will your soul in Hell; but if you are\r\ninnocent, it will float on the water.” The truth or falsehood of this\r\nassertion is never tested, for the criminal invariably confesses before\r\nhis turn arrives to undergo the ordeal.[1058]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF THE BALANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen above that a belief existed that persons guilty of sorcery\r\nlost their specific gravity, and this superstition naturally led to the\r\nuse of the balance in the effort to discover and punish the crime of\r\nwitchcraft, which all experts assure us was the most difficult of all\r\noffences on which to obtain evidence. The trial by balance, however,\r\nwas not a European invention. Like nearly all the other ordeals, it\r\ncan be traced back to India, where, at least as early as the time of\r\nthe Institutes of Vishnu, it was in common use. It is described there\r\nas reserved for women, children, old men, invalids, the blind, the\r\nlame, and the privileged Brahman caste, and not to be undertaken when\r\na wind was blowing. After proper ceremonies the patient was placed in\r\none scale, with an equivalent weight to counterbalance him in the\r\nother, and the nicety of the operation is shown by the prescription\r\nthat the beam must have a groove with water in it, evidently for the\r\npurpose of detecting the slightest deflection either way. The accused\r\nthen descended and the judge addressed the customary adjuration to the\r\nbalance:—\r\n\r\n “Thou, O balance, art called by the same name as holy law (dharma);\r\n thou, O balance, knowest what mortals do not comprehend.\r\n\r\n “This man, arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee. Therefore\r\n mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.”\r\n\r\nThen the accused was replaced in the scale, and if he were found to be\r\nlighter than before he was acquitted. If the scale broke, the trial was\r\nto be repeated.[1059]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen here that lightness was an evidence of innocence, but\r\nin Europe the ordeal was reversed in consequence of the belief that\r\nsorcerers became lighter than water. Rickius, writing in 1594, speaks\r\nof this mode of trial being commonly used in many places in witchcraft\r\ncases, and gravely assures us that very large and fat women had been\r\nfound to weigh only thirteen or fifteen pounds;[1060] but even this\r\nwill scarcely explain the modification of the process as employed in\r\nsome places, which consisted in putting the accused in one scale and\r\na Bible in the other.[1061] Kœnigswarter assures us that the scales\r\nformerly used on these occasions are still to be seen at Oudewater\r\nin Holland.[1062] In the case already referred to as occurring July\r\n30, 1728, at Szegedin in Hungary, thirteen persons, six men and seven\r\nwomen, were burnt alive for witchcraft, whose guilt had been proved,\r\nfirst by the cold-water ordeal and then by that of the balance. We are\r\ntold that a large and fat woman weighed only one and a half drachms\r\nand her husband five drachms and the rest varied from a pennyweight to\r\nthree drachms and under. One of the victims was a man of 82, a local\r\njudge, who had previously borne an unblemished character.[1063] The use\r\nof the Bible as a counterpoise is on record even as lately as the year\r\n1759, at Aylesbury in England, where one Susannah Haynokes, accused\r\nof witchcraft, was formally weighed against the Bible in the parish\r\nchurch.[1064]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of the cross (_judicium crucis, stare ad crucem_) was\r\none of simple endurance and differed from all its congeners, except\r\nthe duel, in being bilateral. The plaintiff and defendant, after\r\nappropriate religious ceremonies and preparation, stood with uplifted\r\narms before a cross, while divine service was performed, victory being\r\nadjudged to the one who was able longest to maintain his position.\r\nAn ancient formula for judgments obtained in this manner in cases of\r\ndisputed titles to land prescribes the term of forty-two nights for\r\nthe trial.[1065] It doubtless originated in the use of this exercise\r\nby the Church both as a punishment and as a penance.[1066] Of its use\r\nas an ordeal the earliest instance which I have observed occurs in a\r\nCapitulary of Pepin le Bref, in 752, where it is prescribed in cases of\r\napplication by a wife for dissolution of marriage.[1067] Charlemagne\r\nappears to have regarded it with much favor, for he not only frequently\r\nrefers to it in his edicts, but, when dividing his mighty empire, in\r\n806, he directs that all territorial disputes which may arise in the\r\nfuture between his sons shall be settled in this manner.[1068] An\r\nexample occurring during his reign shows the details of the process. A\r\ncontroversy between the bishop and citizens of Verona, relative to the\r\nbuilding of certain walls, was referred to the decision of the cross.\r\nTwo young ecclesiastics, selected as champions, stood before the sacred\r\nemblem from the commencement of mass; at the middle of the Passion,\r\nAregaus, who represented the citizens, fell lifeless to the ground,\r\nwhile his antagonist, Pacificus, held out triumphantly to the end, and\r\nthe bishop gained his cause, as ecclesiastics were wont to do.[1069]\r\n\r\nWhen a defeated pleader desired to discredit his own compurgators, he\r\nhad the right to accuse them of perjury, and the question was then\r\ndecided by this process.[1070] In a similar spirit, witnesses too\r\ninfirm to undergo the battle-trial, by which in the regular process of\r\nlaw they were bound to substantiate their testimony, were allowed, by a\r\nCapitulary of 816, to select the ordeal of the cross, with the further\r\nprivilege, in cases of extreme debility, of substituting a relative or\r\nother champion, whose robustness promised an easier task for the Divine\r\ninterference.[1071]\r\n\r\nA slight variation of this form of ordeal consisted in standing with\r\nthe arms extended in the form of a cross, while certain portions\r\nof the service were recited. In this manner St. Lioba, Abbess of\r\nBischoffsheim, triumphantly vindicated the purity of her flock,\r\nand traced out the offender, when the reputation of her convent\r\nwas imperilled by the discovery of a new-born child drowned in a\r\nneighboring pond.[1072]\r\n\r\nThe sensitive piety of Louis le Débonnaire was shocked at this use of\r\nthe cross, as tending to bring the Christian symbol into contempt,\r\nand in 816, soon after the death of Charlemagne, he prohibited its\r\ncontinuance, at the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle;[1073] an order which\r\nwas repeated by his son, the Emperor Lothair.[1074] Baluze, however,\r\nconsiders, with apparent reason, that this command was respected\r\nonly in the Rhenish provinces and in Italy, from the fact that the\r\nmanuscripts of the Capitularies belonging to those regions omit the\r\nreferences to the ordeal of the cross, which are retained in the\r\ncopies used in the other territories of the Frankish empire.[1075]\r\nLouis himself would seem at length to have changed his opinion;\r\nfor, in the final division of his succession between his sons, he\r\nrepeats the direction of Charlemagne as regards the settlement of\r\ndisputed boundaries.[1076] The procedure, however, appears to have\r\nsoon lost its popularity, and indeed never to have obtained the wide\r\nand deeply-seated hold on the veneration of the people enjoyed by the\r\nother forms of ordeal, though there is extant a formula for confirming\r\ndisputed titles to real estate decided in this manner.[1077] We see\r\nlittle of it at later periods, except the trace it has left in the\r\nproverbial allusion to an _experimentum crucis_.\r\n\r\nIn India a cognate mode is adopted by the people of Ramgur to settle\r\nquestions of disputed boundaries between villages. When agreement by\r\nargument or referees is found impossible, each community chooses a\r\nchampion, and the two stand with one leg buried in the earth until\r\nweariness or the bites of insects cause one of them to yield, when the\r\nterritory in litigation is adjudged to the village of the victor.[1078]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CORSNÆD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of consecrated bread or cheese (_judicium offæ, panis\r\nconjuratio, pabulum probationis_, the _corsnæd_ of the Anglo-Saxons)\r\nwas administered by presenting to the accused a piece of bread\r\n(generally of barley) or of cheese, about an ounce in weight,[1079]\r\nover which prayers and adjurations had been pronounced. After\r\nappropriate religious ceremonies, including the communion, the morsel\r\nwas eaten, the event being determined by the ability of the accused\r\nto swallow it. This depended of course on the imagination, and we\r\ncan readily understand how, in those times of faith, the impressive\r\nobservances which accompanied the ordeal would affect the criminal,\r\nwho, conscious of guilt, stood up at the altar, took the sacrament, and\r\npledged his salvation on the truth of his oath. The mode by which a\r\nconviction was expected may be gathered from the forms of the exorcism\r\nemployed, of which a number have been preserved.\r\n\r\n “O Lord Jesus Christ, ... grant, we pray thee, by thy holy name,\r\n that he who is guilty of this crime in thought or in deed, when this\r\n creature of sanctified bread is presented to him for the proving of\r\n the truth, let his throat be narrowed, and in thy name let it be\r\n rejected rather than devoured. And let not the spirit of the Devil\r\n prevail in this to subvert the judgment by false appearances. But\r\n he who is guilty of this crime, let him, chiefly by virtue of the\r\n body and blood of our Lord which he has received in communion, when\r\n he takes the consecrated bread or cheese tremble, and grow pale in\r\n trembling, and shake in all his limbs; and let the innocent quietly\r\n and healthfully, with all ease, chew and swallow this morsel of bread\r\n or cheese, crossed in thy holy name, that all may know that thou art\r\n the just Judge,” etc.[1080]\r\n\r\nAnd even more forcible in its devout impiety is the following:—\r\n\r\n “O God Most High, who dwellest in Heaven, who through thy Trinity\r\n and Majesty hast thy just angels, send, O Lord, thy Angel Gabriel to\r\n stick in the throat of those who have committed this theft, that they\r\n may neither chew nor swallow this bread and cheese created by Thee. I\r\n invoke the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with twelve thousand\r\n Angels and Archangels. I invoke the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark,\r\n Luke, and John. I invoke Moses and Aaron, who divided the sea. That\r\n they may bind to their throats the tongues of the men who have\r\n committed this theft, or consented thereto. If they taste this bread\r\n and cheese created by Thee, may they tremble like a trembling tree,\r\n and have no rest, nor keep the bread and cheese in their mouths;\r\n that all may know Thou art the Lord, and there is none other but\r\n Thee!”[1081]\r\n\r\nAs the efficiency of the ordeal depended upon the effect produced on\r\nthe imagination of the patient clerical ingenuity exhausted itself\r\nin devising tremendous and awe-inspiring exorcisms. One like the\r\nfollowing, for instance, could hardly fail to constrict the throat of\r\nthe most hardened sinner:—\r\n\r\n “I exorcise thee, accursed and most filthy dragon, basilisk, evil\r\n serpent, by the Word of truth, by almighty God, by the spotless Lamb\r\n begotten of the Highest, conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the\r\n Virgin Mary, whose coming Gabriel announced, whom when John saw he\r\n cried aloud This is the Son of the living God, that thou may’st have\r\n no power over this bread or cheese, but that he who committed this\r\n theft may eat in trembling and vomit forth by Thy command, Holy Father\r\n and Lord, almighty and eternal God.... May he who has stolen these\r\n things or is an accomplice in this, may his throat and his tongue\r\n and his jaws be narrowed and constricted so that he cannot chew this\r\n bread or cheese, by the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, by\r\n the tremendous Day of Judgment, by the four Evangels, by the twelve\r\n Apostles, by the four and twenty elders who daily praise and worship\r\n Thee, by that Redeemer who deigned for our sins to stretch his hands\r\n upon the cross, that he who stole these things cannot chew this bread\r\n or cheese save with a swelled mouth and froth and tears, by the aid\r\n of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honor and glory forever and\r\n forever.”[1082]\r\n\r\nYet Boccaccio’s story of Calendrino, which turns upon the mixing of\r\naloes with the bread administered in the _corsnæd_, perhaps affords a\r\nmore rationalistic explanation of the expected miracle.[1083]\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the superstitions connected with this usage\r\nis found in the story related by most of the English chroniclers\r\nconcerning the death of Godwin, Duke of Kent, father of King Harold,\r\nand in his day the king-maker of England. As he was dining with his\r\nroyal son-in-law, Edward the Confessor, some trivial circumstance\r\ncaused the king to repeat an old accusation that his brother Alfred\r\nhad met his death at Godwin’s hands. The old but fiery duke, seizing\r\na piece of bread, exclaimed: “May God cause this morsel to choke me if\r\nI am guilty in thought or in deed of this crime!” Then the king took\r\nthe bread and blessed it, and Godwin, putting it in his mouth, was\r\nsuffocated by it, and fell dead.[1084] A poetical life of Edward the\r\nConfessor, written in the thirteenth century, gives a graphic picture\r\nof the death of the duke and the vengeful triumph of the king:—\r\n\r\n    “L’aleine e parole pert\r\n    Par le morsel ki ferm s’ahert.\r\n    Morz est li senglant felun;\r\n    Mut out force la benaicun,\r\n    Ke duna a mors vertu,\r\n    Par unc la mort provée fu.\r\n    ‘Atant’ se escrie li rois,\r\n    ‘Treiez hors ceu chen punois.’”[1085]\r\n\r\nThis form of ordeal never obtained the extended influence which\r\ncharacterized some of the other modes, and it seems to have been\r\nchiefly confined to the populations allied to the Saxon race. In\r\nEngland, before the Conquest, it was enjoined on the lower orders of\r\nthe clergy who were unable to procure conjurators,[1086] and it may be\r\nconsidered as a plebeian mode of trial, rarely rising into historical\r\nimportance. Its vitality, however, is demonstrated by the fact that\r\nLindenbruck, writing in 1613, states that it was then still in frequent\r\nuse.[1087]\r\n\r\nAimoin relates a story which, though in no sense judicial, presents us\r\nwith a development of the same superstition. A certain renowned knight\r\nnamed Arnustus unjustly occupied lands belonging to the Benedictine\r\nAbbey of Fleury. Dining at the usurped property one day, and boasting\r\nof his contempt for the complaints of the holy monks, he took a pear\r\nand exclaimed—“I call this pear to witness that before the year is\r\nout I will give them ample cause for grumbling.” Choking with the\r\nfirst morsel, he was carried speechless to bed, and miserably perished\r\nunhouselled, a warning to evildoers not to tempt too far the patience\r\nof St. Benedict.[1088] Stories such as this are by no means uncommon,\r\nand are not without interest as a portion of the armory by which the\r\nclergy defended themselves against their unquiet neighbors. Of kindred\r\nnature is an occurrence related about the year 1090, when Duke Henry of\r\nLimburg was involved in a quarrel with Engilbert, Archbishop of Trèves,\r\nand treated with contempt the excommunication and anathema inflicted\r\nupon him. Joking upon the subject with his followers one day at dinner,\r\nhe tossed a fragment of food to his dog, remarking that if the animal\r\nate it, they need not feel apprehensive of the episcopal curse. The\r\ndog refused the tempting morsel, though he manifested his hunger by\r\neagerly devouring food given him by another hand, and the duke, by the\r\nadvice of his counsellors, lost no time in reconciling himself with his\r\nghostly adversary. This is the more remarkable, as Engilbert himself\r\nwas under excommunication by Gregory VII., being a stanch imperialist,\r\nwho had received his see from Henry IV., and his pallium from the\r\nantipope Guiberto.[1089]\r\n\r\nIn India, this ordeal is performed with a kind of rice called _sathee_,\r\nprepared with various incantations. The person on trial eats it, with\r\nhis face to the East, and then spits upon a peepul leaf. “If the saliva\r\nis mixed with blood, or the corners of his mouth swell, or he trembles,\r\nhe is declared to be a liar.”[1090] A slightly different form is\r\ndescribed for cases in which several persons are suspected of theft.\r\nThe consecrated rice is administered to them all, is chewed lightly,\r\nand then spit out upon a peepul leaf. If any one ejects it either dry\r\nor tinged with blood, he is adjudged guilty.[1091]\r\n\r\nBased on the same theory is a ceremony performed by the pre-Aryan\r\nhill-tribes of Rajmahal, when swearing judges into office preparatory\r\nto the trial of a case. In this a pinch of salt is placed upon a\r\n_tulwar_ or scimitar, and held over the mouth of the judge, to whom is\r\naddressed the adjuration, “If thou decidest contrary to thy judgment\r\nand falsely, may this salt be thy death!” The judge repeats the\r\nformula, and the salt is washed with water into his mouth.[1092]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE EUCHARIST AS AN ORDEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times in India there has been in common use an ordeal\r\nknown as _cosha_, consisting of water in which an idol has been\r\nwashed. The priest celebrates solemn rites “to some tremendous deity,”\r\nsuch as Durga or the Adityas, whose image is then bathed in water.\r\nThree handfuls of this water are then drunk by the accused, and if\r\nwithin fourteen days he is not visited with some dreadful calamity\r\nfrom the act of the deity or of the king, “he must indubitably be\r\nacquitted.”[1093]\r\n\r\nIn adapting the ordeal system to Christianity the natural substitute\r\nfor this pagan ceremony was the administration of the Eucharist. This,\r\nindeed, formed a portion of the preparatory rites in all the judgments\r\nof God, the Host being given with the awful adjuration, “May this body\r\nand blood of our Lord Jesus Christ be a judgment to thee this day!”\r\nThe apostle had said that “he that eateth and drinketh unworthily\r\neateth and drinketh damnation to himself” (I. _Corinth._ xi. 28, 29),\r\nand the pious veneration of the age accepted the admonition literally.\r\nMediæval literature is full of legends showing the miraculous power\r\nof the Eucharist in bringing sinners to repentance and exposure,\r\neven without any special invocation; and the absolute belief in this\r\nfetishism, even by the irreligious, is fairly illustrated by the\r\ncase of a dissolute priest of Zurich, in the fourteenth century. An\r\nhabitual drunkard, gambler, and fornicator, he yet celebrated mass\r\ndaily with exemplary regularity. On being warned of the dangers to\r\nwhich he was thus exposing himself in partaking of the Eucharist, he\r\nat length confessed that he never consecrated the host, but that he\r\ncarried about him a small round piece of wood, resembling the holy\r\nwafer, which he exhibited to the people and passed it off for the body\r\nof Christ. The honest chronicler fairly explodes with indignation\r\nin relating the subterfuge, and assures us that while the priest\r\nsucceeded in escaping one danger he fell into a much greater, as\r\nhe was the cause of leading his flock into the unpardonable sin of\r\nidolatry. Apparently his parishioners thought so too, for though they\r\nhad patiently endured the scandals of his daily life, as soon as this\r\ntrick became known they drove him away unceremoniously.[1094] What this\r\npastor, but for his ingenious device, might have reasonably dreaded\r\nis to be learned from the story of a volunteer miracle vouchsafed to\r\nan unchaste priest at Lindisfarne, who being suddenly summoned to\r\ncelebrate mass without having had time to purify himself, when he came\r\nto partake of the sacramental cup, saw the wine change to an exceeding\r\nblackness. After some hesitation he took it, and found it bitter to the\r\nlast degree. Hurrying to his bishop, he confessed his sin, underwent\r\npenance, and reformed his life.[1095] Even more edifying was a case\r\nrelated as happening in France about the year 1200. A priest yielded\r\nto the temptation of the flesh immediately before celebrating mass on\r\nChristmas eve, when, after consecrating the body and blood, and before\r\nhe could touch them with his polluted lips, a white dove appeared which\r\ndrank the wine and carried off the wafer. It happened that he could\r\nfind no one to replace him during the ceremonies of the festival,\r\nand, though appalled by the miracle, he could not refuse to perform\r\nhis functions without exposure, so that a second and a third time he\r\nwent through the canon with the same result. Finally he applied to an\r\nabbot, and confessed his sin with due contrition. The abbot postponed\r\ninflicting penance until the priest should officiate again, when the\r\ndove reappeared, bearing in its beak the three wafers, and returning\r\nto the chalice all the wine it had taken. Filled with rejoicing at\r\nthis evidence that his contrition was accepted, the priest cheerfully\r\nundertook three years’ pilgrimage in the Holy Land, prescribed for him\r\nby the abbot, and on his return entered a convent.[1096]\r\n\r\nA still more striking manifestation of the interposition of God by\r\nmeans of the Eucharist to vindicate innocence is to be found in the\r\ncase of Erkenbald de Burban, a noble of Flanders, who was renowned for\r\nhis inflexible administration of justice. While lying on his death-bed,\r\nhis favorite nephew and heir endeavored to violate one of the maidens\r\nof the castle. Erkenbald ordered him to be hanged, but his followers\r\nwere afraid to execute the sentence; so, when after an interval, the\r\nyouth approached his uncle for a reconciliation, the latter put his\r\narm affectionately round his neck, and drove a dagger up to the hilt\r\nin his throat. When Erkenbald made his final confession preparatory\r\nto the last sacrament, he refused to include this deed among his\r\nsins, claiming that it was an act of righteousness, and his bishop\r\nconsequently refused to administer the Host. The dying man obdurately\r\nallowed him to depart; then ordering him recalled, asked him to see\r\nwhether he had the wafer in his pyx. On the latter being opened it\r\nwas found empty, and Erkenbald exhibited it to him in his mouth. The\r\nEucharist which man had refused, God had ministered to the righteous\r\njudge.[1097]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, easy to understand the superstition of the ages of\r\nfaith which believed that, when the consecrated wafer was offered\r\nunder appropriate adjurations, the guilty could not receive it; or\r\nthat, if it were taken, immediate convulsions and speedy death, or\r\nsome other miraculous manifestation would ensue, thus constituting\r\nits administration for such purposes a regular and recognized form of\r\nordeal. This is well illustrated by a form of exorcism preserved by\r\nMansi: “We humbly pray thy Infinite Majesty that this priest, if guilty\r\nof the accusation, shall not be able to receive this venerated body of\r\nthy Son, crucified for the salvation of all, and that what should be\r\nthe remedy of all evil shall prove to him hurtful, full of grief and\r\nsuffering, bearing with it all sorrow and bitterness.”[1098] What might\r\nbe expected under such circumstances is elucidated by a case which\r\noccurred in the early part of the eleventh century, as reported by the\r\ncontemporary Rodolphus Glaber, in which a monk, condemned to undergo\r\nthe trial, boldly received the sacrament, when the Host, indignant\r\nat its lodgment in the body of so perjured a criminal, immediately\r\nslipped out at the navel, white and pure as before, to the immense\r\nconsternation of the accused, who forthwith confessed his crime.[1099]\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of this mode of trial is shown in its employment by\r\nCautinus, Bishop of Auvergne, towards the close of the sixth century.\r\nA certain Count Eulalius was popularly accused of parricide, whereupon\r\nhe was suspended from communion. On his complaining of thus being\r\npunished without a trial, the bishop administered the sacrament under\r\nthe customary adjuration, and Eulalius, taking it without harm,\r\nwas relieved from the imputation.[1100] It was usually, however,\r\na sacerdotal form of purgation, as is shown by the Anglo-Saxon\r\nlaws,[1101] and by the canons of the council of Worms in 868, embodied\r\nin the _Decretum_ of Gratian.[1102] Thus, in 941, Frederic, Archbishop\r\nof Mainz, publicly submitted to an ordeal of this kind, to clear\r\nhimself of the suspicion of having taken part in an unsuccessful\r\nrebellion of Henry, Duke of Bavaria, against his brother, Otho the\r\nGreat.[1103] After the death of Henry, slander assailed the fame of\r\nhis widow, Juthita, on account of an alleged intimacy between her\r\nand Abraham, Bishop of Freisingen. When she, too, died, the bishop\r\nperformed her funeral rites, and, pausing in the mass, he addressed\r\nthe congregation: “If she was guilty of that whereof she was accused,\r\nmay the Omnipotent Father cause the body and blood of the Son to be\r\nmy condemnation to just perdition, and perpetual salvation to her\r\nsoul!”—after which he took the sacrament unharmed, and the people\r\nacknowledged the falsity of their belief.[1104] In 1050, Subico, Bishop\r\nof Speyer, sought to clear himself of a similar accusation at the\r\ncouncil of Mainz, in the same manner, when according to one version he\r\nsucceeded, while another less friendly account assures us that his jaw\r\nbecame paralyzed in the very act, and remained so till the day of his\r\ndeath.[1105]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking instance recorded of its administration\r\nwas, however, in a secular matter, when in 869 it closed the unhappy\r\ncontroversy between King Lothair and his wives, to which reference has\r\nbeen already made. To reconcile himself to the Church, Lothair took a\r\nsolemn oath before Adrian II. that he had obeyed the ecclesiastical\r\nmandates in maintaining a complete separation from his pseudo-wife\r\nWaldrada, after which the pontiff admitted him to communion, under an\r\nadjuration that it should prove the test of his truthfulness. Lothair\r\ndid not shrink from the ordeal, nor did his nobles, to whom it was\r\ngiven on their declaring that they had not abetted the designs of the\r\nconcubine; but leaving Rome immediately afterwards, the royal _cortége_\r\nwas stopped at Piacenza by a sudden epidemic which broke out among the\r\ncourtiers, and there Lothair died, August 8th, with nearly all of his\r\nfollowers—an awful example held out by the worthy chroniclers as a\r\nwarning to future generations.[1106]\r\n\r\nIn this degradation of the Host to the level of daily life there was\r\na profanity repugnant to a reverential mind, and we are therefore not\r\nsurprised to find King Robert the Pious, in the early part of the\r\neleventh century, raising his voice against its judicial use, and\r\nthreatening to degrade the Archbishop of Sens for employing it in this\r\nmanner, especially as his biographer informs us that the custom was\r\ndaily growing in favor.[1107] Robert’s example was soon afterwards\r\nimitated by Alexander II., whose pontificate lasted from 1061 to\r\n1073.[1108] The next pope, however, the impetuous Hildebrand, made use\r\nof it on a memorable occasion. When, in 1077, the Emperor Henry IV. had\r\nendured the depths of humiliation before the castle gate of Canossa,\r\nand had at length purchased peace by submitting to the exactions\r\ndemanded of him, the excommunication under which he had lain was\r\nremoved in the chapel. Then Gregory, referring to the crimes imputed to\r\nhimself by the emperor’s partisans, said that he could easily refute\r\nthem by abundant witnesses; “but lest I should seem to rely rather on\r\nhuman than on divine testimony, and that I may remove from the minds of\r\nall, by immediate satisfaction, every scruple, behold this body of our\r\nLord which I am about to take. Let it be to me this day a test of my\r\ninnocence, and may the Omnipotent God this day by his judgment absolve\r\nme of the accusations if I am innocent, or let me perish by sudden\r\ndeath if guilty!” Swallowing the wafer, he turned to the emperor, and\r\ndemanded of him the same refutation of the charges urged against him\r\nby the German princes. Appalled by this unexpected trial, Henry in an\r\nagony of fear evaded it, and consulted hurriedly with his councillors\r\nhow to escape the awful test, which he finally declined on the ground\r\nof the absence of both his friends and his enemies, without whose\r\npresence the result would establish nothing.[1109] In estimating the\r\nmingled power of imagination and conscience which rendered the proposal\r\ninsupportable to the emperor, we must allow for the influence which\r\na man like Hildebrand with voice and eye can exert over those whom\r\nhe wishes to impress. At an earlier stage of his career, in 1055, he\r\nimprovised a very effective species of ordeal, when presiding as papal\r\nlegate at the Council of Lyons, assembled for the repression of simony.\r\nA guilty bishop had bribed the opposing witnesses, and no testimony was\r\nobtainable for his conviction. Hildebrand addressed him: “The episcopal\r\ngrace is a gift of the Holy Ghost. If, therefore, you are innocent,\r\nrepeat, ‘Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost!’”\r\nThe bishop boldly commenced, “Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and\r\nto—” here his voice failed him, he was unable to finish the sentence;\r\nand, confessing the sin, he was deposed.[1110]\r\n\r\nHenry’s prudence in declining the Eucharistic ordeal was proved by the\r\nfate of the unfortunate Imbrico, Bishop of Augsburg, who, in the same\r\nyear, 1077, after swearing fealty to Rodolph of Suabia, abandoned him\r\nand joined the emperor. Soon after, while saying mass before Henry,\r\nto prove the force of his loyal convictions, he declared that the\r\nsacrament he was about to take should attest the righteousness of his\r\nmaster’s cause; and the anti-imperialist chronicler duly records that a\r\nsudden disease overtook him, to be followed by speedy death.[1111] In\r\nthe case of William, Bishop of Utrecht, as related by Hugh of Flavigny,\r\nthe Eucharist was less an ordeal than a punishment. He dared, at the\r\nAssembly of Utrecht, in 1076, to excommunicate Gregory, at the command\r\nof Henry IV.; but when, at the conclusion of the impious ceremony, he\r\naudaciously took the Host, it turned to fire within him, and, shrieking\r\n“I burn! I burn!” he fell down and miserably died.[1112]\r\n\r\nAccording to a Spanish theologian in the sixteenth century, when the\r\nEucharist was administered as an ordeal it was to be taken without\r\nprevious sacramental confession—presumably in order that the accused\r\nmight not escape in consequence of absolution.[1113] After the\r\nReformation, the Protestants who denied the real presence naturally\r\nrejected this form of ordeal, but Del Rio, writing in 1599, compares\r\nthem to frogs swelling themselves against an elephant; and Peter\r\nKluntz, in 1677, assures us that it was still commonly used in his\r\nday.[1114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDEAL OF THE LOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal to chance, as practised in India, bears several forms,\r\nsubstantially identical in principle. One mode consists in writing\r\nthe words _dherem_ (consciousness of innocence) and _adherem_ (its\r\nopposite) on plates of silver and lead respectively, or on pieces of\r\nwhite and black linen, which are placed in a vessel that has never held\r\nwater. The person whose cause is at stake inserts his hand and draws\r\nforth one of the pieces, when if it happens to be _dherem_ it proves\r\nhis truth.[1115] Another method is to place in a vessel a silver image\r\nof Dharma, the genius of justice, and one in iron or clay of Adharma;\r\nor else a figure of Dharma is painted on white cloth and another on\r\nblack cloth, and the two are rolled together in cow-dung and thrown\r\ninto a jar, when the accused is acquitted or convicted according to his\r\nfortune in drawing Dharma.[1116]\r\n\r\nIn adapting to Christian usage the ordeal of the lot, attempts were\r\nmade to invest it with similar sacred symbolism, but it was not well\r\nadapted to display the awful solemnity which rendered the other forms\r\nso impressive. Notwithstanding the ample warrant for it in Scripture,\r\nand its approval by St. Augustin,[1117] it was therefore in less favor\r\nwith the Church, and it seems not to have retained among the people,\r\nafter their conversion, the widespread popularity and confidence\r\nenjoyed by the other ordeals. Indeed, as a judicial process, it is only\r\nto be found prescribed in the earlier remains of the Barbarian laws and\r\ncustoms, and no trace of it is to be met with in the latter legislation\r\nof any race. Thus mention of it is made in the Ripuarian code,[1118]\r\nand in some of the earlier Merovingian documents its use is prescribed\r\nin the same brief manner.[1119] As late as the middle of the eighth\r\ncentury, Ecgberht, Archbishop of York, quotes from the canons of an\r\nIrish Council a direction for its employment in cases of sacrilegious\r\ntheft, as a means of determining the punishment to be inflicted;[1120]\r\nbut not long after, the Council of Calchuth condemned the practice\r\nbetween litigants as a sacrilege and a remnant of paganism.[1121] This\r\nwas ineffectual, for about 850 Leo IV. describes it as in universal use\r\nin England, and forbids it as mere divination.[1122]\r\n\r\nNo explanation is given of the details of the process by which this\r\nappeal to fortune was made, and I know of no contemporary applications\r\nby which its formula can be investigated; but in the primitive Frisian\r\nlaws there is described an ordeal of the lot, which may reasonably be\r\nassumed to show us one of the methods in use. When a man was killed in\r\na chance-medley and the murderer remained unknown, the friends had a\r\nright to accuse seven of the participants in the brawl. Each of these\r\ndefendants had then to take the oath of denial with twelve conjurators,\r\nafter which they were admitted to the ordeal. Two pieces of twig,\r\nprecisely similar, were taken, one of which was marked with a cross;\r\nthey were then wrapped up separately in white wool and laid on the\r\naltar; prayers were recited, invoking God to reveal the innocence or\r\nguilt of the party, and the priest, or a sinless youth, took up one of\r\nthe bundles. If it contained the marked fragment, the defendants were\r\nabsolved; if the unmarked one, the guilty man was among them. Each\r\none then took a similar piece of stick and made a private mark upon\r\nit; these were rolled up as before, placed on the altar, taken up one\r\nby one, and unwrapped, each man claiming his own. The one whose piece\r\nwas left to the last was pronounced guilty, and was obliged to pay\r\nthe wer-gild of the murder.[1123] Among the ancient Irish the lot or\r\n_crannchur_ was employed by mingling white and black stones, when if\r\nthe accused drew a black one he was adjudged guilty.[1124]\r\n\r\nThe various modes of ecclesiastical divination, so frequently used in\r\nthe Middle Ages to obtain an insight into the future, sometimes assumed\r\nthe shape of an appeal to Heaven to decide questions of the present or\r\nof the past.[1125] Thus, when three bishops, of Poitiers, Arras, and\r\nAutun, each claimed the holy relics of St. Liguaire, and human means\r\nwere unavailing to reconcile their pretensions, the decision of the\r\nSupreme Power was resorted to, by placing under the altar-cloth three\r\nslips with their respective names inscribed, and after a becoming\r\namount of prayer, on withdrawing one of them, the see of Poitiers was\r\nenriched with the precious remains by Divine favor.[1126]\r\n\r\nThat such appeals to chance were regarded by the Church with disfavor\r\nis shown by Gratian, who argues that the Hebrew examples were not\r\nprecedents to be observed under the New Law.[1127] Yet the second\r\ncouncil of Barcelona in 599 had decreed that when an episcopal vacancy\r\nwas to be filled two or three candidates should be chosen by the clergy\r\nand people, and from among these the metropolitan and his suffragans\r\nshould select one by lot, after due fasting and prayer.[1128]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting applications of the lot on record was\r\nthat by which the founders of the Bohemian Brethren determined upon\r\nthe future existence of the sect. At an assembly of deputies held\r\nat Lhotka, in 1467, the lot was resorted to to ascertain whether it\r\nwas the will of God that they should separate themselves from the\r\nRoman presbyterate and seek consecration from the Waldenses, when the\r\nresponse was in the affirmative. Then nine men were chosen, from among\r\nwhom three or two, or one, or none should be drawn as candidates for\r\nthe episcopate. Twelve cards were taken, three inscribed “is” and nine\r\n“is not,” and nine of them were distributed among the men selected.\r\nThree were found to be drawn; one of them was sent to an Austrian\r\ncommunity of Waldenses for episcopal consecration, and the “Unitas\r\nFratrum” was then organized.[1129] This same pious dependence on the\r\nwill of God is still preserved by the Mennonites in the choice of\r\npastors. As described in the journals of 1884 an election of this kind\r\nin Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where there were twenty candidates,\r\nwas conducted by three bishops. After divine service twenty books\r\nwith clasps were taken in one of which was inserted a slip of paper\r\ninscribed _Ein Diener des Wort_; the books were placed in a row on a\r\ntable and each applicant selected one. Bishop Shenk proceeded to open\r\nthe books, and in the eleventh, held by Menno Zimmerman, the paper was\r\nfound, entitling him to the position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClosely related to the lot are the appeals to chance, to settle\r\ndoubtful questions or ascertain guilt. Such was that made by the\r\npious monks of Abingdon, about the middle of the tenth century, to\r\ndetermine their right to the meadows of Beri against the claims of some\r\ninhabitants of Oxfordshire. For three days, with fasting and prayer,\r\nthey implored the Divine Omnipotence to make manifest their right; and\r\nthen, by mutual assent, they floated on the Thames a round buckler,\r\nbearing a handful of wheat, in which was stuck a lighted taper. The\r\nsturdy Oxonians gaped at the spectacle from the distant bank, while a\r\ndeputation of the more prudent monks followed close upon the floating\r\nbeacon. Down the river it sailed, veering from bank to bank, and\r\npointing out, as with a finger, the various possessions of the Abbey,\r\ntill at last, on reaching the disputed lands, it miraculously left the\r\ncurrent of the stream, and forced itself into a narrow and shallow\r\nchannel, which in high water made an arm of the river around the\r\nmeadows in question. At this unanswerable decision, the people with one\r\naccord shouted “Jus Abbendoniæ, jus Abbendoniæ!” and so powerful was\r\nthe impression produced, that the worthy chronicler assures us that\r\nthenceforth neither king, nor duke, nor prince dared to lay claim to\r\nthe lands of Beri, showing conclusively the wisdom of the abbot who\r\npreferred thus to rely upon his right rather than on mouldy charters or\r\ndilatory pleadings.[1130]\r\n\r\nA more prosaic form of the ordeal of chance is the trial by Bible\r\nand key which is of old Teutonic origin.[1131] It is still in common\r\nuse in England, where it may even yet “be met with in many an\r\nout-of-the-way-farm-house.” In cases of theft a key is secured at\r\nPsalm 50, 18: “When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with\r\nhim, and hast been partaker with adulterers;”[1132] and the mode in\r\nwhich it is expected to reveal guilt is manifested in a case recorded\r\nin the London _Times_ as occurring at Southampton in 1867, where a\r\nsailor boy on board a collier was brought before court on a charge of\r\ntheft, the only evidence against him being that afforded by securing\r\na key in a Bible opposite the first chapter of Ruth. The Bible was\r\nthen swung round while the names of several suspected persons were\r\nrepeated, and on the mention of the prisoner’s name the book fell on\r\nthe floor. A somewhat different method is recounted in a case reported\r\nby the journals in 1879, where a woman in Ludlow, who had lost a\r\nsheet, perambulated the streets of the town with a Bible and key,\r\nand brought a prosecution against a person whose guilt she had thus\r\ndiscovered. It was explained in court that the key was placed at Ruth\r\nI. 16, the investigator holding his fingers crossed, and when\r\nthe thief was named the key would spontaneously move. In this case the\r\nprosecutrix declared that when she came to the defendant’s house “the\r\nBible turned completely round and fell out of her hands.” A variant\r\nof this, described in two MSS. of the twelfth century, consisted in\r\nplacing a piece of wood over the verse of the Psalm, “Thou art just,\r\nO Lord, and thy judgment is true;” the book was then securely bound\r\nso that the head of the wood protruded, and it was suspended, while a\r\npriest uttered an adjuration and the accused was questioned, the result\r\nbeing apparently determined by the motion or rest of the book. Still\r\nanother form consisted of suspending a small loaf of bread which had\r\nbeen placed behind the altar during mass and at its conclusion blessed\r\nand marked with a cross by the priest. At the trial he uttered a\r\nconjuration, when if the bread turned the accused was held guilty.[1133]\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the Bible and key is the sieve-driving or sieve-turning\r\nby which criminals were detected by the tilting or falling of a sieve\r\nwhen, in repeating the names of those suspected, that of the culprit\r\nwas mentioned. The sieve required to be an heirloom in the family;\r\nit was balanced on the point of a pair of scissors, or was laid\r\nupon a pair of tongs, or the point of a pair of scissors was driven\r\ninto the rim and it was suspended by the ring to the middle finger\r\nof the right hand. This was of ancient origin and was extensively\r\npractised in France and Germany even in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies.[1134] The existence of the same belief in England is\r\nshown in 1554, when William Haselwood, on being cited before the\r\necclesiastical court of the diocese of London, said that having lost\r\nhis purse “remembering that he being a chylde dyd hear his mother\r\ndeclare that when any man had lost anything, then they wolde use a syve\r\nand a payre of sheers to bring to knowledge who hadd the thing lost;\r\nand so he did take a seve and a payre of sheeres and hanged the seve\r\nby the pointe of the sheeres and sayd these words: By Peter and Paule\r\nhe hath yt, namying the party whom he in that behalf suspected.”[1135]\r\nEvidently at this time the Church regarded the process as sorcery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBIER-RIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief that at the approach of the murderer the corpse of the\r\nslain would bleed or give some other sign has, under the names of _jus\r\nferetri_, _jus cruentationis_, _bahr-recht_, and “bier-right,” been a\r\nresource eagerly seized by puzzled jurists. Its source is not easily\r\ntraced. There is no evidence of its existence among the Eastern Aryans,\r\nnor is it alluded to in any of the primitive “Leges Barbarorum,” though\r\nRussian legends render probable that it was current among the Slavs\r\nat an early day.[1136] Enthusiastic explorers into antiquity quote\r\nAristotle for it,[1137] while others find in Lucretius evidence that\r\nit was shared by cultured Romans.[1138] Possibly its origin may be\r\nderived from a Jewish custom under which pardon was asked of a corpse\r\nfor any offences committed against the living man, the offender laying\r\nhold of the great toe of the body as prepared for sepulture, and it is\r\nsaid to be not uncommon, where the injury has been grievous, for the\r\nlatter to respond to the touch by a copious nasal hemorrhage.[1139]\r\n\r\nThe earliest allusion I have met with to this belief occurs in 1189,\r\nand shows that already it was rooted in popular credulity. It is the\r\nwell-known story that when Richard Cœur de Lion hastened to the funeral\r\nof his father, Henry II., and met the procession at Fontevraud, the\r\nblood poured from the nostrils of the dead king, whose end he had\r\nhastened by his rebellion and disobedience.[1140] Although it never\r\nseems to have formed part of English jurisprudence, its vitality in\r\nthe popular mind is shown in Shakespeare’s Richard III., where Gloster\r\ninterrupts the obsequies of Henry VI. and Lady Anne exclaims:—\r\n\r\n    “O gentlemen,see, see! dead Henry’s wounds\r\n    Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!”\r\n\r\nAnd in the ballad of “Earl Richard”—\r\n\r\n    “Put na the wite on me, she said,\r\n      It was my may Catherine.\r\n    Then they hae cut baith fern and thorn,\r\n      To burn that maiden in.\r\n\r\n    “It wadna take upon her cheik,\r\n      Nor yet upon her chin,\r\n    Nor yet upon her yellow hair\r\n      To cleanse that deadly sin.\r\n\r\n    “The maiden touched that clay-cauld corpse,\r\n      A drap it never bled.\r\n    The ladye laid her hand on him,\r\n      And soon the ground was red.”[1141]\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the belief was equally prevalent in Scotland.\r\nIndeed King James VI. gave it the stamp of his royal authority,[1142]\r\nand cases on record there show that it was occasionally received as\r\njudicial evidence, and even sometimes prescribed as an ordeal for\r\ndetection. Thus in 1611, doubts arising as to the mode by which a\r\nperson had met his death, the vicinage was summoned, as we are told\r\naccording to custom, to touch the body which had been exhumed for the\r\npurpose. The murderer, whose rank relieved him of suspicion, kept\r\naway, but his little daughter, attracted by curiosity, approached the\r\ncorpse, when it began to bleed and the crime was proved.[1143] One\r\nof the most noted cases in which crime was detected in this manner\r\nwas that of Philip Standsfield, tried in 1688 for the murder of his\r\nfather, Sir James Standsfield of New Milne. In this the indictment\r\nsets forth that after the body had been found in a pond and an autopsy\r\nhad been performed by a surgeon, “James Row, merchant, having lifted\r\nthe left side of Sir James, his head and shoulder, and the said Philip\r\nthe right side, his father’s body, though carefully cleaned, as said\r\nis, did (according to God’s usual mode of discovering murders), blood\r\nafresh upon him and defiled all his hands, which struck him with such\r\na terror that he immediately let his father’s head and body fall with\r\nviolence and fled from the body and in consternation and confusion\r\ncryed Lord have mercy upon me! and bowed himself down over a seat\r\nin the church (where the corp were inspected), wiping his father’s\r\ninnocent blood off his own murdering hands upon his cloaths.” When such\r\nwas the spirit of the prosecution it need not surprise us that though\r\nthe defence showed that in the autopsy an incision had been made in the\r\nneck, where there was a large accumulation of extravasated blood, and\r\nthough high authorities were quoted to prove that such bleeding was not\r\nevidence sufficient even to justify torture, Philip Standsfield was\r\ncondemned and executed in spite of the insufficiency of circumstantial\r\nevidence.[1144] A similar incident is recorded in the indictment of\r\nChristian Wilson, tried for witchcraft at Edinburgh in 1661.[1145]\r\nThese cases are typical, inasmuch as they illustrate the two forms, the\r\nexistence of which differentiates this from other ordeals. Sometimes,\r\nas in others, suspects were brought, under judicial order, to view or\r\ntouch the body. Frequently, however, the occurrence is spontaneous, and\r\nserves to excite or direct suspicion where none existed before.\r\n\r\nThe belief extended throughout all the nationalities of Europe.\r\nAlthough there is no reference to it in the German municipal codes\r\nof the thirteenth century, there is ample store of cases both of\r\nits spontaneous occurrence and of its judicial employment. In 1261,\r\nat Forchheim, a manifestation of this kind brought home to the Jews\r\nthe lingering death of a young girl slain by them according to their\r\nhellish custom, and the guilty were promptly broken on the wheel.[1146]\r\nMore serious was an affair at Ueberlingen in 1331. The body of a\r\nchild was found in a pond and from the character of the wounds it was\r\nrecognized that Jewish fanaticism had caused the murder. The corpse was\r\ntherefore carried in front of the houses of the principal Jews and when\r\nit began to bleed the evidence was deemed sufficient. The burgomaster\r\nendeavored to calm the populace, but his efforts were ascribed to\r\nHebrew gold, and condign punishment was resolved upon. All the Jews of\r\nthe town were skilfully decoyed into a large stone house and when they\r\nhad been securely locked in the upper stories it was set on fire. Those\r\nthat succeeded in throwing themselves from the roof were dispatched by\r\nthe mob, and the rest, to the number of three hundred, were consumed\r\nby the avenging flames. Though sundry miracles ratified the justice of\r\nthe act, yet the godless Emperor, Louis of Bavaria, punished the pious\r\ntownsfolk by dismantling their walls and levying a heavy fine upon\r\nthem.[1147] The judicial employment of the ordeal is seen in a case\r\nin 1324, when Reinward, a canon of Minden, was murdered by a drunken\r\nsoldier and the crime was proved by a trial of this kind.[1148] More\r\nsatisfactory, as showing how through the influence of imagination the\r\nordeal sometimes resulted in substantial justice, was a case in Lucerne\r\nin 1503, when Hans Speiss of Etiswiler murdered his wife. She was duly\r\nburied, but suspicion arose, and after three weeks the body was exhumed\r\nand he was brought before it. As he approached, it flushed with color\r\nand immediately began to bleed. He had hitherto defiantly asserted\r\nhis innocence, but at this sight he fell on his knees, confessed the\r\ncrime, and begged for mercy. He was broken on the wheel and died most\r\npenitently.[1149] Numerous cases are on record of its use throughout\r\nGermany in the seventeenth century, of which it will suffice to refer\r\nto one in which the corpse manifested a discrimination greatly\r\nimpressing the authorities. It had been dead for thirty-six hours and\r\nrefused to bleed on the approach of two persons suspected. Then three\r\nothers were brought, one of whom, George, had planned the murder and\r\nbeen present, but had not taken personal part in it: for him the corpse\r\nbled at the mouth. Then came Lorenz, who had held the victim when the\r\nblow was struck: for him the mouth frothed and the wound bled. Finally\r\nClaus, who had inflicted the blow, came, and for him the blood gushed\r\nforth from the wound.[1150]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which popular credulity was prepared to accept this\r\nmiraculous manifestation is shown in a story which obtained wide\r\ncurrency. An Austrian noble journeying to Vienna passed through a wood\r\nin which his dogs scratched up some bones. Their whiteness struck his\r\nfancy; he carried them to the city and sent them to a cutler to be\r\nworked up into some ornament, when as soon as they were brought into\r\nthe presence of the artificer they became covered with blood. The noble\r\nreported the fact to the magistrates, the cutler was arrested and\r\nconfessed that twenty years before he had slain a comrade and buried\r\nthe body where the bones were found.[1151] We may trace a more poetic\r\nform of this sympathy in the legend which relates the welcome given by\r\nthe bones of Abelard to Heloise when, twenty years after his death, her\r\nbody was consigned to his tomb.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, though this form of trial finds no place in the codes of\r\nlaw, we are told that it was generally used during the seventeenth\r\ncentury in all appropriate cases.[1152] In Holstein there was a\r\ncustom known as _Scheingehen_, in which, when a murderer remained\r\nundiscovered, a hand was severed from the corpse with provident care\r\nand preserved as a touchstone for the future. A celebrated case is\r\nrelated in the books in which a dead body was found and buried, and the\r\nhand was hung up in the prison of Itzehoe. Ten years later a thief was\r\narrested and brought there, when the hand immediately began to bleed\r\nfreely, and the thief confessed the murder.[1153]\r\n\r\nItaly shared fully in the belief. The most distinguished exponent\r\nof the New Learning in the fifteenth century, Marsiglio Ficino, the\r\nPlatonist, does not hesitate to adduce it as a fact well known to\r\njudges, in his argument to prove the immortality of the soul against\r\nthe Averrhoism fashionable in his day.[1154] Equally distinguished\r\nas a jurist was Hippolito de’ Marsigli (died in 1528), who relates\r\nthat in his youth he was governor of Alberga, near Genoa, when a\r\nmurder occurred without affording evidence as to the perpetrator. By\r\nthe advice of an old citizen he had the body brought before him and\r\nsummoned all liable to suspicion to pass near it one by one. When the\r\nhomicide approached, to the surprise of Marsigli, the wounds burst out\r\nafresh, but his incredulity was such that he did not consider this to\r\nwarrant even an arrest until he had collected sufficient collateral\r\nevidence, when the culprit confessed without torture.[1155] In Venice\r\nthis ordeal was sometimes used and likewise in Piedmont, though in the\r\nlatter region some magistrates regarded it as fallacious, for their\r\nexperience showed that blood had not flowed in the presence of those\r\nsubsequently proved to be guilty.[1156] In Corsica the belief, if not\r\nstill existent, has been widely diffused until within a few years.[1157]\r\n\r\nFrance seems to have been even more addicted to this superstition.\r\nAbout 1580 President Bertrand d’Argentré, in his Commentaries on\r\nthe Customs of Brittany, treats it as an indisputable fact and one\r\naffording good evidence.[1158] In Picardy we are told it was constantly\r\nused by magistrates, it was approved by the courts in Bordeaux, and\r\nChassanée, whose authority in Burgundy was great, argues that its\r\noccurrence justifies the torture of the accused without further\r\nevidence.[1159] Spain likewise was not exempt from it. A celebrated\r\ncase is cited in the books as occurring in Aragon, where the accused\r\nwas brought before the corpse of the victim in the public square and\r\nappealed to God to perform a miracle if he were guilty, whereupon the\r\nbody raised its right arm, pointed with its fingers to the several\r\nwounds and then to the accused; this was regarded as sufficient proof,\r\nand under sentence of the Council of Aragon the culprit was executed.\r\nAnother case which occurred at Ledesma, near Salamanca, shows the\r\nexistence of the belief in Castile.[1160]\r\n\r\nEnglish colonists brought the superstition across the Atlantic, where\r\nit has never been fairly eradicated from the popular mind. In January,\r\n1680, in Accomac County, Virginia, a new-born illegitimate child of\r\n“Mary, daughter of Sarah, wife of Paul Carter” died and was buried. It\r\nwas nearly six weeks before suspicion was aroused, when the coroner\r\nimpanelled a jury of twelve matrons, whose verdict recorded that\r\nSarah Carter was brought to touch the corpse without result, but when\r\nPaul Carter touched it “immediately whilst he was stroaking ye childe\r\nye black and settled places above ye body of ye childe grew fresh and\r\nred so that blud was ready to come through ye skin of ye childe.” On\r\nthe strength of this verdict an indictment was found against Paul\r\nCarter, but with what result the records do not show.[1161] Nearly a\r\ncentury later, in 1767, the coroner’s jury of Bergen County, N. J., was\r\nsummoned to view the body of one Nicholas Tuers, whose death had led to\r\nsuspicion of murder. Johannes Demarest, the coroner, attests that he\r\nhad no belief in bier-right and paid no attention to the experiment,\r\nwhen one of the jury touched the body without result. At length a slave\r\nnamed Harry, who had been suspected without proof, was brought forward\r\nfor the trial when he heard an exclamation “He is the man,” and was\r\ntold that the body had bled when touched by Harry. He then ordered the\r\nslave to place his hand on its face, when about a tablespoonful of\r\nblood flowed from each nostril, and Harry confessed the murder.[1162]\r\nSo recently as 1833 a man named Getter was hanged in Pennsylvania for\r\nthe murder of his wife, and among the evidence which was allowed to go\r\nto the jury on the trial was that of a female witness, who swore “If\r\nmy throat was to be cut I could tell, before God Almighty, that the\r\ndeceased smiled when he (the murderer) touched her. I swore this before\r\nthe justice, and also that she bled considerably. I was sent for to\r\ndress her and lay her out. He touched her twice. He made no hesitation\r\nabout doing it. I also swore before the justice that it was observed by\r\nother people in the house.”[1163] This is perhaps the latest instance\r\nin which bier-right has figured in regular judicial proceedings, but\r\nthe popular belief in it is by no means eradicated. In 1860 the\r\nPhiladelphia journals mention a case in which the relatives of a\r\ndeceased person, suspecting foul play, vainly importuned the coroner,\r\nsix weeks after the interment, to have the body exhumed in order that\r\nit might be touched by a person whom they regarded as concerned in his\r\ndeath. In 1868 at Verdiersville, Virginia, a suspected murderer was\r\ncompelled to touch the body of a woman found murdered in a wood; and\r\nin 1869, at Lebanon, Illinois, the bodies of two murdered persons were\r\nexhumed and two hundred of the neighbors were marched past and made to\r\ntouch them in the hope of identifying the criminals.[1164]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, in the seventeenth century, there was a recognized formula\r\nfor the administration of the ordeal. The corpse was exposed to the\r\nopen air for some hours, with breast and stomach bare to insure the\r\nthorough coagulation of the blood. The person suspected was then\r\nbrought forward and required to repeat certain adjurations read to him,\r\nand then he was made to touch with two fingers the mouth, the navel,\r\nand the wounds, if there were any. If the corpse manifested any signs\r\nof sensation, if there was frothing at the mouth, or bleeding from any\r\norifices or wounds it was considered an evidence of guilt.[1165] The\r\ntrial was not a mere popular experiment, but was a judicial proceeding,\r\nunder the order of a magistrate.\r\n\r\nAlthough bier-right, in comparison with other ordeals, plays so\r\ninconspicuous a part in the history of jurisprudence, it is especially\r\ninteresting in one respect. As a judicial expedient, it did not spring\r\ninto notice until after the other vulgar ordeals had been discredited\r\nand banished from the courts. It escaped the censure of the Church and\r\nwas a survival of the Judgment of God, reaching its fullest development\r\nin the seventeenth century. It thus became the subject of investigation\r\nand debate in an age of critical tendencies and comparative\r\nintelligence. Among those who had faith in it there was much fruitless\r\nspeculation to account for the result, and there was by no means a\r\nconsensus of opinion as to the causes at work. In 1487 the inquisitor\r\nSprenger takes a materialistic view and uses it as the basis of an\r\nargument on the wonderful properties of inanimate matter. He explains\r\nthat air is introduced into the wound when it is inflicted, and that it\r\nrushes out when agitated by the presence of the slayer, bringing blood\r\nwith it, but he adds that others believe it to be the cry of blood\r\nfrom the earth against the murderer, as related of the first homicide,\r\nCain.[1166] About a century later Del Rio tells us that some looked\r\nupon it as a miracle, others as an accident, while he himself can see\r\nno better reason than the violent antipathy conceived by the slain for\r\nthe slayer.[1167] Carena holds it to be the mysterious Judgment of God,\r\nunless it happens to be the work of the demon, and in this uncertainty\r\nconcludes that if there are no other proofs it only justifies further\r\ninvestigation and not torture.[1168] Oelsner informs us that learned\r\nmen disputed whether it was occasioned by antipathy or sympathy, by the\r\nremains of the soul in the body, by wandering spirits of the dead, or\r\nby the spirit of enmity, and he concludes that the causes are sometimes\r\nnatural and sometimes supernatural.[1169] It is significant that, among\r\nso many theories framed by believers in the fact, there were so few who\r\nassented to the direct interposition of God.\r\n\r\nAmong jurists there was lively debate as to the exact weight of the\r\nevidence when the experiment was successful. Criminal lawyers were\r\nnaturally loath to admit that it was decisive, for the corollary\r\nfollowed that if no bleeding occurred the suspect must be innocent,\r\nwhich was contradicted by the numerous cases in which an accused\r\nsuccessfully passed through the ordeal and was subsequently proved to\r\nbe guilty. This decisiveness was the essence of the older ordeals,\r\nand was wholly opposed to the current inquisitorial system in which\r\ncertainty was aimed at by the habitual use of torture. Almost with\r\nunanimity, therefore, the legists held that it was only one of the\r\nindications pointing to guilt, and that its failure could not be\r\nalleged as a proof of innocence. They differed, however, as to the\r\nweight of the indication which it afforded. Authoritative names were\r\ncited in favor of the opinion that it sufficed by itself to justify\r\nthe subjection of the accused to torture, as in a case at Marburg in\r\n1608, where on this ground alone several suspects were tortured, when\r\nthey confessed and were executed. Others took the position that it did\r\nnot of itself warrant the use of torture, and that it required to be\r\nsupported by other proof. Among these was the great criminal jurist\r\nCarpzov, who states that in cases submitted to him and his colleagues\r\nhe had seen many in which no bleeding occurred when the murderers\r\ntouched the corpse, while in others it did occur when innocents were\r\nexposed to the trial.[1170] When the discussion had reached this stage\r\nthe ordeal became a superfluity which was bound to disappear from the\r\ncourts in spite of the persistence of popular credulity, and a school\r\nof jurists arose who denied that it deserved the name of evidence, and\r\ndeclared that it must be wholly disregarded. It was only a question\r\nof time when this opinion should triumph, and the first quarter of\r\nthe eighteenth century probably witnessed the disappearance of this\r\nsurvival of mediævalism from recognized judicial procedure.[1171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nOATHS AS ORDEALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oath naturally formed an integral portion of the ordeal. Even\r\nas in the battle trial both parties, on entering the lists, were\r\ncompelled to swear to the truth of their assertions, so in the other\r\nordeals the accuser and accused took an oath immediately prior to the\r\nadministration of the test.[1172] Sometimes, however, the oath of\r\nthe accused was regarded as a sufficient ordeal in itself. We have\r\nseen above how, among many and diverse races, disculpatory oaths are\r\nadministered with ceremonies which render them practically ordeals\r\nin view of the popular belief that misfortune will follow perjury.\r\nThe anthropomorphic mythology of Hellas presents this idea in its\r\nmost concrete form by the most solemn oath of the gods, taken on the\r\nwater of Styx brought in a vase for the purpose, perjury on which was\r\nfollowed by a year of stupor and nine years of segregation from all\r\nfellowship with the brother immortals.[1173] We have also seen (pp.\r\n29 sqq.) that in Christendom the Church set little store by simple\r\noaths, but reckoned their obligation by the holiness of the material\r\nobjects on which they were taken; and when these were relics of\r\npeculiar sanctity they were held to have the power of punishing the\r\nperjurer, thus rendering the oath administered upon them an absolute\r\nordeal. This belief developed itself at an early period in the history\r\nof the Church. St. Augustin relates that at Milan a thief, who swore\r\nupon some holy relics with the intention of bearing false witness, was\r\nforced irresistibly to confess himself guilty of the offence which he\r\ndesigned to fasten upon another; and Augustin himself, when unable\r\nto decide between two of his ecclesiastics who accused each other of\r\nrevolting crime, sent them both to the shrine of St. Felix of Nola, in\r\nthe full expectation that the judgment of God would bring to light the\r\ntruth as between them.[1174] Gregory the Great shows the same belief\r\nwhen he alludes to a simple purgatorial oath taken by a bishop on the\r\nrelics of St. Peter in terms which expressly convey the idea that the\r\naccused, if guilty, had exposed himself to no little danger, and that\r\nhis performance of the ceremony unharmed had sufficiently proved his\r\ninnocence. Gregory, moreover, in one of his Homilies, assumes that\r\nperjury committed on the relics of the saints is punished by demoniacal\r\npossession.[1175]\r\n\r\nThis was not a belief likely to be allowed to die out for lack\r\nof nourishment. When, in the tenth century, Adaulfus, Bishop of\r\nCompostella, was accused of a nameless crime, and was sentenced by the\r\nhasty judgment of the king to be gored to death by a wild bull, he\r\nhad taken the precaution, before appearing at the trial, to devoutly\r\ncelebrate mass in his full pontificals. The bull, maddened with dogs\r\nand trumpets, rushed furiously at the holy man; then, suddenly pausing,\r\nadvanced gently towards him and placed its horns in his hands, nor\r\ncould any efforts of the assistants provoke it to attack him. The\r\nking and his courtiers, awed by this divine interposition in favor of\r\ninnocence, threw themselves at the feet of the saint, who pardoned them\r\nand retired to the wildest region of the Asturias, where he passed\r\nthe rest of his days as an anchorite. He left his chasuble behind him,\r\nhowever, and this garment thenceforth possessed the miraculous power\r\nthat, when worn by any one taking an oath, it could not be removed if\r\nhe committed perjury.[1176]\r\n\r\nIn other cases the shrines of saints convicted the perjurer by\r\nthrowing him down in an epileptic fit, or by fixing him rigid and\r\nmotionless at the moment of his invoking them to witness his false\r\noath.[1177] The monks of Abingdon boasted a black cross made from the\r\nnails of the crucifixion, said to have been given them by the Emperor\r\nConstantine, a false oath on which was sure to cost the malefactor\r\nhis life; and the worthy chronicler assures us that the instances in\r\nwhich its miraculous power had been triumphantly exhibited were too\r\nnumerous to be specified.[1178] At the priory of Die, dependent on the\r\ngreat Benedictine abbey of Fleury, there was preserved an arm-bone\r\nof St. Maur, which was possessed of somewhat similar properties. On\r\none occasion a steward of the priory named Joscelin was accused of\r\nembezzlement, and offered to rebut the evidence against him by an oath\r\ntaken on the arm of St. Maur. Rejoiced at passing through the test\r\ntriumphantly, he removed his hand from the relic, and stroking his long\r\nbeard with it he exclaimed, “By this beard, the oath I swore was true!”\r\nwhen suddenly the beard came off in his hand, and his chin, thenceforth\r\nhairless, was the evidence alike of his guilt and his perjury, so\r\nthat he and his descendants were at once proclaimed ineligible to the\r\nstewardship.[1179] Less serious in its consequences was a false oath\r\ntaken by a peasant on the altar of St. Martial of Limoges. The offender\r\nwas deprived of speech, and could only bellow like an ox until he had\r\nprayed over the tomb of the saint, and his throat had received the sign\r\nof the cross from a priest.[1180] Even at the present day the jaw-bone\r\nof St. Patrick is preserved near Belfast, and is used extra-judicially\r\nas an ordeal, in the full conviction that the slightest variation from\r\nthe truth will bring instantaneous punishment on the perjurer,[1181]\r\nand in Sardinia a similar oath on relics is believed when false to\r\nflay the hand of the accused.[1182] In the Middle Ages these dangerous\r\nrelics were common, and however we may smile at the simplicity of the\r\nfaith reposed in them, we may rest assured that on many occasions they\r\nwere the means of eliciting confessions which could have been obtained\r\nby no devices of legal subtlety according to modern procedures.\r\n\r\nNor did it always require death to confer the sanctity requisite to\r\nperform these miracles, as was attested during the life of St. Bertrand\r\nof Comminges. A woman accused of adultery went to the saint and laying\r\nher hand on him swore to her innocence, when the hand immediately\r\nwithered and remained a permanent witness of her guilt and her\r\nperjury.[1183]\r\n\r\nEven without any special sanctity in the administration of the oath,\r\nHeaven sometimes interposed to protect the rights of the Church. About\r\nthe year 1200 Cæsarius of Königswinter, a knight, who had borrowed\r\ntwenty marcs of his brother, Hirminold Dean of the Chapter of Bonn,\r\ndenied the loan after his brother’s death. As the money belonged to\r\nthe Church, the chapter summoned the knight, and having no proof, were\r\nobliged to content themselves with his oath. Having accomplished his\r\nperjury, Cæsarius mounted his horse and returned homewards, but when he\r\nhad accomplished the half of his journey his horse was suddenly fixed\r\nimmovable to the earth, and he found himself deprived of the use of the\r\ntongue which he had thus abused. Recognizing the source of the trouble,\r\nhe prayed to Abraham, promising to retrace his steps and confess his\r\nsin. He was immediately released, returned to Bonn, made restitution,\r\nand accepted penance. He subsequently entered the monastery of\r\nHeisterbach as a novice, and related the story of himself.[1184]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPOISON ORDEALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poison ordeal, which forms the basis of judicial proceedings\r\namong so many of the African tribes, seems not to have been brought\r\ninto Europe by the Aryan invaders, although it was in use among their\r\nkindred who remained in the East. Possibly this may have arisen from\r\nthe fact that in their migrations they could no longer obtain the\r\nsubstances which they had been accustomed to use, and before they had\r\nfamiliarized themselves with the resources of their new homes the\r\ncustom may have fallen into desuetude amid the abundance of other\r\nmethods. A lingering remnant of it may perhaps be detected in the\r\ntrial of the priestess of the Gæum in Achaia, already alluded to, but\r\nsubstantially the poison ordeal may be regarded as obsolete in the West.\r\n\r\nIn the East, however, it has continued in use. The poison prescribed\r\nis that known as _sringa_, produced by a tree which grows in the\r\nHimalayas, and the judge invokes it—\r\n\r\n “On account of thy venomous and dangerous nature thou art destruction\r\n to all living creatures; thou, O poison, knowest what mortals do not\r\n comprehend.\r\n\r\n “This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared from guilt.\r\n Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.”\r\n\r\nSeven grains of the substance, mixed with clarified butter, are then\r\nadministered; if no evil symptoms follow during the day, at evening\r\nthe accused is dismissed as innocent.[1185] A more recent authority\r\ndescribes a somewhat different form. A specified quantity of some\r\ndeadly article, varying in amount with its activity, is mixed with\r\nthirty times its weight of _ghee_, or clarified butter. The patient\r\ntakes this, standing with his face to the north, and if it produces no\r\neffect upon him while the bystanders can clap their hands five hundred\r\ntimes, he is pronounced innocent and antidotes are at once administered\r\nto him.[1186] A slight variation of this is recorded by a writer\r\nof the last century. After appropriate religious ceremonies, seven\r\nbarleycorns of the deadly root _vishanaga_, or of arsenic, are mingled\r\nwith thirty-two times its bulk of _ghee_, and eaten by the accused from\r\nthe hand of a Brahman. If it produces no effect, he is acquitted.[1187]\r\nMuch more humane was the custom described by Hiouen Thsang in the\r\nseventh century, when the experiment was performed vicariously on\r\na bullock, even as a hen is used among the Niam-Niam of equatorial\r\nAfrica. The animal was fed with poisoned food, and poison was likewise\r\ninserted in a wound made for the purpose in the right leg, while the\r\nfate of the accused was determined by the death or survival of the\r\nunlucky beast.[1188]\r\n\r\nStill another form in modern times seems to have been invented as a\r\ncombination of the hot-water and poison ordeals. A _naga_ or cobra\r\nis dropped into a deep earthen pot along with a coin or ring, which\r\nthe person on trial must remove with his hand. If he is bitten, he is\r\ncondemned; if he escapes scathless, he is acquitted.[1189]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR ORDEALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe devout dependence upon Heaven, exhibited in the ordeal, did\r\nnot exhaust itself on the forms of trial described above, but was\r\nmanifested in various other expedients, sometimes adopted as legal\r\nprocesses, and sometimes merely the outcome of individual credulous\r\npiety. While therefore they cannot be regarded as forming part of the\r\nrecognized institutions of Europe, still they illustrate too clearly\r\nthe tendency of thought and belief to be entirely passed over.\r\n\r\nAmong these may be classed a practice which was substantially an\r\nappeal to God to regulate the amount of punishment requisite for the\r\nexpiation of a crime. One or more bands of iron were not infrequently\r\nfastened around the neck or arm of a murderer, who was banished until\r\nby pilgrimage and prayer his reconciliation and pardon should be\r\nmanifested by the miraculous loosening of the fetter, showing that\r\nsoul and body were both released from their bonds.[1190] A case is\r\nrelated of a Pole thus wandering with a circlet tightly clasped to each\r\narm. One fell before the intercession of St. Adalbert, the apostle\r\nof Prussia, but the other retained its hold until the sinner came to\r\nthe shrine of St. Hidulf near Toul. There, joining in the worship\r\nof the holy monks, the remaining band flew off with such force that\r\nit bounded against the opposite wall, while the pardoned criminal\r\nfell fainting to the ground, the blood pouring from his liberated\r\narm: a miracle gratefully recorded by the spiritual children of the\r\nsaint.[1191] Equally melodramatic in its details is a similar instance\r\nof an inhabitant of Prunay near Orléans, laden with three iron bands\r\nfor fratricide. His weary pilgrimage was lightened of two by the\r\nintercession of St. Peter at Rome, and the third released itself in\r\nthe most demonstrative manner through the merits of St. Bertin and St.\r\nOmer.[1192] If the legend of St. Emeric of Hungary be true, the pope\r\nhimself did not disdain to prescribe this ordeal to the criminal whose\r\nmiraculous release caused the immediate canonization of the saint by\r\na synod in 1073.[1193] In France at one time we are told that this\r\npenance or punishment was habitual in cases of parricide or fratricide,\r\nwhen the rings or chains were wrought from the sword with which the\r\ncrime had been committed.[1194] Repentant sinners also frequently\r\nbound themselves with iron rings and chains by way of penance, and the\r\nspontaneous disruption of these, which sometimes occurred, was regarded\r\nas a sign that God had pardoned the penitent.[1195] The shrine of St.\r\nNicetius at Lyons had a special reputation in these cases, and the\r\npile of broken rings and chains exhibited there in the sixth century\r\ntestified to the power of the saint’s intercession.[1196]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the age is likewise manifested in an appeal to Heaven\r\nwhich terminated a quarrel in the early part of the twelfth century\r\nbetween St. Gerald, Archbishop of Braga, and a magnate of his diocese,\r\nconcerning the patronage of a church. Neither being inclined to yield,\r\nat length the noble prayed that God would decide the cause by not\r\npermitting the one who was in the wrong to live beyond the year, to\r\nwhich St. Gerald assented; and in six months the death of the unhappy\r\nnoble showed how dangerous it was to undertake such experiments with\r\na saint.[1197] This, indeed, may be held to have warrant of high\r\nauthority, for when, in 336, Alexander Bishop of Constantinople\r\nwas about to engage in disputation with the arch-heretic Arius, he\r\nunderwent a long fast, and shut himself up for many days and nights\r\nalone in his church praying to God, and finally supplicating that if\r\nhis faith were wrong he might not live to see the day of contest, while\r\nif Arius were in error he likewise might be taken off in advance; and\r\nthe orthodoxy of the Nicene creed was confirmed miraculously by the\r\nsudden and terrible death of Arius within a few days.[1198]\r\n\r\nThe error of the Arian doctrine of the Trinity was demonstrated by\r\nanother volunteer miracle about the year 510, when Deuterius the Arian\r\nBishop of Constantinople undertook to baptize a convert in the name of\r\nthe Father through the Son in the Holy Ghost, and was rebuked for using\r\nthis heretical formula by the sudden disappearance of all the water in\r\nthe font.[1199]\r\n\r\nWith these examples may be classed a trial of faith proposed by\r\nHerigarius, one of the earliest Christian converts of Sweden, as\r\nconclusive, though not so dangerous as that of Bishop Poppo. After\r\nfrequent disputes with his Pagan neighbors, he one day suggested, when\r\na storm was approaching, that they should stand on one side and he\r\non the other, and see which of them would get wet. The rain came down\r\nin torrents and nearly drowned the heathen scoffers, while Herigarius\r\nand a boy in his company serenely looked on, untouched by a single\r\ndrop.[1200]\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the ninth century, the attacks of Rollo and his\r\nNormans drove the monks of St. Martin of Tours to seek safety for\r\nthemselves and the priceless relics of their saint at Auxerre, the body\r\nof St. Martin was deposited in the church of St. Germain near the tomb\r\nof the latter. The miracles wrought by the newcomer speedily caused\r\na large influx of oblations which the strangers took to themselves.\r\nThe monks of St. Germain claimed an equal share on the ground that\r\nthe miracles were wrought by the combined merits of both saints. The\r\nTouraingeois resisted the demand, and finally offered to decide the\r\nquestion by taking a leper and placing him for a night between the\r\nrival reliquaries. If he should in the morning be entirely cured, they\r\nagreed to admit that both saints were concerned in the miracles, and\r\nthat the receipts should be shared; but if only one side of him was\r\nrestored to health then the saint on whose side he was cured should\r\nhave the credit and his monks the money. This was agreed to; the leper\r\nwas placed between the tombs, and both parties spent the night in\r\nprayer. In the morning he was found with the half of him towards St.\r\nMartin sound and well, while the side towards St. Germain had not been\r\nin the least benefited. To remove any lingering doubts, he was then\r\nturned around, and the other side was cured. The result was beyond\r\nfurther question, and the monks of St. Martin were permitted to enjoy\r\nin peace thenceforth the offerings of the faithful.[1201]\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happened that the direct interference of Heaven,\r\nwithout the use of formulas, was volunteered to stay the blundering\r\nhand of human justice. In 1219, near Cologne, a man was condemned\r\nfor theft and promptly hanged, but when the spectators supposed him\r\ncomfortably dead, he suddenly exclaimed, “Your labor is vain; you\r\ncannot strangle me, for my lord bishop St. Nicholas is aiding me. I see\r\nhim.” Taking this for a convincing proof of his innocence, the crowd\r\nat once cut him down, and he hastened to the church of Bruweiler to\r\ngive thanks for his miraculous escape.[1202] It is curious to observe,\r\nhowever, that the pious contemporary narrator of this instance of the\r\npower of St. Nicholas is careful to let us understand that the man may\r\nhave been guilty after all. St. Olaf of Norway once interfered in the\r\nsame way to support, during nine hours of suspension, a man unjustly\r\nhanged on a false accusation of theft.[1203]\r\n\r\nHeaven could also be directly appealed to without the intervention\r\nof the hot iron or boiling water. A question of much importance to\r\nnorthern Italy was thus settled in the tenth century, when Uberto of\r\nTuscany, driven into exile by Otho the Great, returned after a long\r\nabsence, and found his wife Willa with a likely boy whose paternity he\r\nrefused to acknowledge. After much parleying, the delicate question\r\nwas thus settled. A large assembly, consisting principally of\r\necclesiastics, was convened, in which Uberto sat without anything to\r\ndistinguish him. The boy, who had never seen him, was placed in the\r\ncentre, and prayers were offered by all present that he should be led\r\nby divine instinct to his father. The prayers were promptly answered,\r\nfor he rushed without hesitation to the arms of Uberto, who could no\r\nlonger indulge in unworthy doubts, and in time Ugo became the most\r\npowerful prince of Italy.[1204]\r\n\r\nThere would appear to have been a form of ordeal known as the judgment\r\nof the Holy Ghost, but its details are unknown. Pope Stephen VII.\r\nemployed it for the condemnation of the body of his predecessor Pope\r\nFormosus, in 896. The corpse was dug up for the purpose, clad in papal\r\nvestments, and brought before a synod of bishops; after condemnation,\r\nthe three fingers used in benediction were cut off, and it was cast\r\ninto the Tiber. After the murder of Stephen in 898, John IX. assembled\r\nanother council which annulled the condemnation and forbade such\r\nproceedings in the future, for the unanswerable reason that a dead body\r\ncannot vindicate itself, and the judgment was still further discredited\r\nwhen the corpse was fished out of the river, and on being brought into\r\nSt. Peter’s all the sacred images there bowed to it. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the judgment of the Holy Ghost it naturally became obsolete.[1205]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the simplest and at the same time one of the most barbarous\r\nof ordeals is prescribed in a MS. of the eleventh century for Jews\r\nunlucky enough to be involved in controversies with Christians. The\r\nJew was made to stand up and his knees were closely bound together; a\r\ncollar made of brambles was placed around his neck, and a switch of\r\nbrambles, five cubits long and well furnished with thorns, was smartly\r\ndragged between his thighs. If he escaped without a scratch he was\r\nacquitted.[1206]\r\n\r\nIn the crazied effort to detect the all-pervading and secret crime\r\nof witchcraft, a number of superstitious observances found currency\r\namong the people which practically assumed the position of ordeals.\r\nThus in the latter half of the sixteenth century it was believed that\r\na fragment of earth from a grave, when sanctified in the Mass and\r\nplaced on the threshold of a church door, would prevent the egress of\r\nany witch who might be within; and a similar power was attributed to a\r\nsplinter of oak from a gallows, sprinkled with holy water and hung up\r\nin the church porch.[1207]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF THE ORDEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal was thoroughly and completely a judicial process, ordained\r\nby the law for certain cases, and carried out by the tribunals as\r\na regular form of ordinary procedure. From the earliest times, the\r\naccused who was ordered to undergo the trial was compelled to submit to\r\nit, as to any other decree of court. Thus, by the Salic law, a recusant\r\nwas summoned to the royal court; and if still contumacious, he was\r\noutlawed and his property confiscated, as was customary in all cases\r\nof contempt.[1208] The directions of the codes, as we have seen, are\r\ngenerally precise, and admit of no alternative.[1209] Occasionally,\r\nhowever, a privilege of selection was afforded between this and\r\nother modes of compurgation, and also between the various forms of\r\nordeal.[1210]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a remarkable exception to this enforcement of the\r\nordeal in a provision existing in some codes by which a man condemned\r\nto it could buy himself off by compounding with his adversary. This\r\nmode of adjustment was not extensively introduced, but it nevertheless\r\nexisted among the Anglo-Saxons,[1211] while among the Franks it was a\r\nsettled custom, permitted by all the texts of the Salic law, from the\r\nearliest to the latest.[1212] By this a person condemned by the court\r\nto undergo the ordeal could, by a transaction with the aggrieved party,\r\npurchase the privilege of clearing himself by canonical purgation,\r\nand thus escape the severer trial. He was bound to pay his accuser\r\nonly a portion of the fine which he would incur if proved guilty—a\r\nportion varying with different offences from one-fourth to one-sixth\r\nof the _wer-gild_. The interests of the tribunal were guarded by a\r\nclause which compelled him to pay to the _grafio_, or judge, the full\r\n_fredum_, or public fine, if his conscience impelled him to submit\r\nto an arrangement for more than the legal percentage. Even as late\r\nas 1229, by the Bohemian laws of Ottokar Premislas the accused could\r\nescape the ordeal by paying seven deniers to the seigneur.[1213]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which its employment was ordered varied\r\nconsiderably with the varying legislations of races and epochs; and to\r\nenter minutely into the question of the power of the court to decree\r\nit, or the right to demand it by the appellant or the defendant, would\r\nrequire too much space, especially as this has already been discussed\r\nat some length with regard to one of its forms, the wager of battle.\r\nIn India, the accused was required to undergo the risk of a fine if\r\nhe desired to force his adversary to the ordeal; but either party\r\ncould voluntarily undertake it, in which case the other was subject to\r\na mulct if defeated.[1214] The character of the defendant, however,\r\nhad an important bearing upon its employment. If he had already been\r\nconvicted of a crime or of perjury he was subject to it in all cases,\r\nhowever trifling; if, on the other hand, he was a man of unblemished\r\nreputation, he was not to be exposed to it, however important was the\r\ncase.[1215] In civil cases, however, it apparently was only employed\r\nto supplement deficient evidence.—“Evidence consists of writings,\r\npossession, and witnesses. If one of these is wanting, then one of the\r\nordeals is valid.”[1216]\r\n\r\nIn Europe there appears at times to have been a custom under which,\r\nwhen the accused had escaped in the ordeal, the accuser was obliged to\r\nundergo it. Thus in the Frisian law, when a man accused of theft proved\r\nhis innocence by the ordeal, the accuser was then obliged to clear\r\nhimself of the charge of perjury by a similar trial,[1217] but the\r\nlaw fails to define what are their respective positions if the second\r\nordeal proves likewise innocuous. In the case of bier-right quoted\r\nabove from Scott’s Border Minstrelsy, this secondary ordeal seems to\r\nhave been to prove whether the accuser herself was not the guilty\r\nperson. In the heroic poems of the Elder Edda a similar trial appears\r\nto be resorted to, as in the Frisian laws, only for the purpose of\r\nshowing the false witness borne by the accuser. When Gudrun the wife of\r\nAtli is defamed as an adulteress by the concubine Herkia, and is forced\r\nto the ordeal—\r\n\r\n    She to the bottom plunged\r\n    Her snow-white hand,\r\n    And up she drew\r\n    The precious stones.\r\n    “See now, ye men,\r\n    I am proved guiltless\r\n    In holy wise,\r\n    Boil the vessel as it may.”\r\n    Laughed then Atli’s\r\n    Heart within his breast\r\n    When he unscathed beheld\r\n    The hand of Gudrun.\r\n\r\n    “Now must Herkia\r\n    To the cauldron go,\r\n    She who Gudrun\r\n    Had hoped to injure.”\r\n    No one has misery seen\r\n    Who saw not that,\r\n    How the hand there\r\n    Of Herkia was hurt.\r\n    They then the woman led\r\n    To a foul slough.\r\n    So were Gudrun’s\r\n    Wrongs avenged.[1218]\r\n\r\nChurchmen held that if the accused escaped in the ordeal the accuser\r\nwas guilty of perjury and homicide and must atone for it by public\r\npenitence.[1219]\r\n\r\nThe absence of satisfactory testimony, rendering the case one not to\r\nbe solved by human means alone is frequently, as in India, alluded to\r\nas a necessary element;[1220] and indeed we may almost assert that\r\nthis was so, even when not specifically mentioned, as far as regards\r\nthe discretion of the tribunal to order an appeal to the judgment of\r\nGod. Yet there were some exceptions to this, as in the early Russian\r\nlegislation, where the ordeal is prescribed for the accused in all\r\ncases in which the accusation is substantiated by testimony;[1221]\r\nand a law of King Ethelred seems to indicate that the plaintiff might\r\nrequire his adversary to submit to it,[1222] while numerous examples\r\namong those cited above authorize the conclusion that an offer on\r\nthe part of the accused was rarely refused, even when there was\r\nstrong evidence against him,[1223] though this laxity of practice was\r\noccasionally objected to stoutly.[1224] When the custom was declining,\r\nindeed, a disposition existed to require the assent of both parties\r\nbefore the tribunal would allow a case to be thus decided.[1225] In\r\ncivil cases, we may assume that absence of testimony, or the consent of\r\nboth parties, was requisite to its employment.[1226]\r\n\r\nThe comfort which the system must have afforded to indolent judges\r\nin doubtful cases is well exhibited by a rule in various ancient\r\ncodes, by which a man suspected of crime, even though no accuser came\r\nforward, was thrown into prison and kept there until he could prove\r\nhis innocence by the ordeal of water.[1227] No testimony was required\r\nsave that of evil repute. Thus in Hungary, in the eleventh century, a\r\nman who was regarded as a thief by the whole village was subjected to\r\nthe ordeal: if he was cleared, he paid the fee to the priest; if he\r\nwas convicted, all his property was confiscated.[1228] This, in fact,\r\nwas virtually the process adopted and systematized in England by the\r\nAssizes of Clarendon in 1166. The grand jury was directed to present\r\nall persons suspected of robbery, murder, theft, etc., when they were\r\npromptly sent to the water ordeal to prove their innocence.[1229] Thus\r\nit afforded an unfailing solution to all doubts and simplified greatly\r\nthe administration of criminal law, for it was equally applicable\r\nto cases of individual prosecutions. In 1201, for instance, a widow\r\naccuses a man of the murder of her husband and the court rejects her\r\nappeal because it does not state that she saw the deed, but as the\r\njurors when interrogated say that the accused is suspected of the\r\ncrime, he is ordered at once to the ordeal.[1230]\r\n\r\nWe have seen above occasional instances in which the accuser or\r\nplaintiff offered to substantiate his veracity by an appeal to the\r\nordeal. This was an established rule with regard to the wager of\r\nbattle, but not as respects the other forms of the judgment of God,\r\nwhich were regarded rather as means of defence than of attack. Still\r\nthere are occasional instances of instructions for their employment by\r\nthe accusing party. In the primitive laws of Russia, an accuser who\r\ncould not substantiate his case with witnesses was obliged to undergo\r\nthe ordeal of red-hot iron.[1231] In England it seems to have been\r\nwithin the discretion of the court to order it for either the accuser\r\nor the accused. A very singular case is recorded in 1202, in which\r\nAstin of Wispington accused Simon of Edlington of assaulting him and\r\nputting out an eye, when the court adjudged the red-hot iron ordeal and\r\ngave to the defendant the option whether he or the prosecutor should\r\nundergo it; Simon naturally preferred that his antagonist should try\r\nthe dangerous experiment, and the result was that the case was settled\r\nwithout it.[1232] We have already seen (p. 385) that in some places\r\nwhere the accused succeeded in clearing himself by the ordeal the\r\naccuser was obliged to undergo it in order to determine the question of\r\nhis perjury.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ordeal was employed in connection with compurgation,\r\nboth for prosecution and defence, to supplement the notorious\r\nimperfections of that procedure. Thus Archbishop Hincmar directs\r\nthat cases of complaint against priests for dissolute life shall be\r\nsupported by seven witnesses, of whom one must submit to the ordeal\r\nto prove the truth of his companions’ oaths, as a wholesome check\r\nupon perjury and subornation.[1233] With a similar object, the same\r\nprelate likewise enjoins it on compurgators chosen by the accused, on\r\nhis failing to obtain the support of those who had been selected for\r\nhim by his judge.[1234] Allied to this was a rule for its employment\r\nwhich was extensively adopted, allowing the accused the privilege\r\nof compurgation with conjurators in certain cases, only requiring\r\nhim to submit to the ordeal on his failing to procure the requisite\r\nnumber of sponsors. Thus, in 794, a certain Bishop Peter, who was\r\ncondemned by the Synod of Frankfort to clear himself, with two or\r\nthree conjurators, of the suspicion of complicity in a conspiracy\r\nagainst Charlemagne, being unable to obtain them, one of his vassals\r\noffered to pass through the ordeal in his behalf, and on his success\r\nthe bishop was reinstated.[1235] That this was strictly in accordance\r\nwith usage is shown by a very early text of the Salic Law,[1236] as\r\nwell as by a similar provision in the Ripuarian code.[1237] Among\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons it likewise obtained, from the time of the earliest\r\nallusion to the ordeal occurring in their jurisprudence, down to\r\nthe period of the Conquest.[1238] Somewhat similar in tendency was\r\na regulation of Frederic Barbarossa, by which a slave suspected of\r\ntheft was exposed to the red-hot iron unless his master would release\r\nhim by an oath.[1239] Occasionally it was also resorted to when the\r\naccused was outsworn after having endeavored to defend himself by his\r\noath or by conjurators. Thus a canon of the Council of Tribur in 895\r\ndeclares that if a man is so generally suspected that he is outsworn\r\nin compurgation, he must either confess or submit to the hot-iron\r\nordeal.[1240] Popular belief evidently might give to the accuser a\r\nlarger number of men willing to associate themselves in the oath of\r\naccusation than the defendant could find to join him in rebutting it,\r\nand yet his guilt might not as yet be clear. In such cases, the ordeal\r\nwas a most convenient resort.\r\n\r\nThese regulations give to the ordeal decidedly the aspect of\r\npunishment, as it was thus inflicted on those whose guilt was so\r\ngenerally credited that they could not find comrades to stand up with\r\nthem at the altar as partakers in their oath of denial; and this is not\r\nthe only circumstance which leads us to believe that it was frequently\r\nso regarded. This notion is visible in the ancient Indian law, where,\r\nas we have seen, certain of the ordeals—those of red-hot iron, poison,\r\nand the balance—could not be employed unless the matter at stake were\r\nequivalent to the value of a thousand pieces of silver, or involved\r\nan offence against the king;[1241] and it reappears in Europe in the\r\ngraduated scale of single and triple ordeals for offences of different\r\nmagnitudes. Such a scheme is so totally at variance with the theory of\r\nmiraculous interposition to protect innocence and punish guilt, that\r\nwe can only look upon it as a mode of inflicting graduated punishments\r\nin doubtful cases, thus holding up a certain penalty _in terrorem_\r\nover those who would otherwise hope to escape by the secrecy of their\r\ncrime—no doubt with a comforting conviction, like that of Legate\r\nArnaud at the sack of Béziers, that God would know his own. This same\r\nprinciple is visible in a provision of the charter of Loudun, granted\r\nby Louis le Gros in 1128, by which an assault committed outside of the\r\nliberties of the commune could be disproved by a simple sacramental\r\noath; but if within the limits of the commune, the accused was obliged\r\nto undergo the ordeal.[1242] In another shape we see it in the customs\r\nof Tournay, granted by Philip Augustus in 1187, where a person accused\r\nof assault with sharpened weapons, if there were no witnesses, was\r\nallowed to purge himself with six conjurators if the affair occurred\r\nin the daytime, but if at night, was obliged to undergo the water\r\nordeal.[1243] Further illustration is afforded by the principle,\r\ninterwoven in various codes, by which a first crime was defensible by\r\nconjurators, or other means, while the _tiht-bysig_ man, the _homo\r\ninfamatus_, one of evil repute, whose character had been previously\r\ncompromised, was denied this privilege, and was forced at once to the\r\nhot iron or the water. Thus, among the Anglo-Saxons, in the earliest\r\nallusion to the ordeal, by Edward the Elder, it is provided that\r\nperjured persons, or those who had once been convicted, should not be\r\ndeemed thereafter oath-worthy, but should be hurried to the ordeal; a\r\nregulation repeated with some variations in the laws of Ethelred, Cnut,\r\nand Henry I.[1244] The Carlovingian legislation establishes a similar\r\nprinciple,[1245] while the canons of Burckhardt show it to be still in\r\nforce in the eleventh century.[1246] A hundred and fifty years later,\r\nthe legislation of Flanders manifests the same tendency, the code\r\ngranted to Bruges in 1190 providing that a first accusation of theft\r\nshould be decided by witnesses, while a second was to be met by the\r\ncold-water ordeal.[1247] In the German municipal law of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the same principle is observable. A man who had forfeited\r\nhis legal privileges by conviction for theft or similar crimes was\r\nno longer admitted to the oath, but on subsequent accusations was\r\ncompelled to choose between the hot iron, the cauldron, and a combat\r\nwith a champion; and similarly an officer of the mint issuing false\r\nmoney was permitted the first time to swear to his ignorance, but on a\r\nsecond offence he had to submit to the ordeal. In the codes in force\r\nthroughout Germany, indeed, previous suspicion was sufficient to send\r\nthe accused to the ordeal in place of the oath.[1248] The contemporary\r\njurisprudence of Spain has a somewhat similar provision, by which a\r\nwoman accused of homicide could not be exposed to the ordeal unless\r\nshe could be proved utterly abandoned, for which a curious standard\r\nwas requisite;[1249] while for more serious crimes, such as sorcery\r\nor killing her husband, she was forced at once to the red-hot iron to\r\nprove her innocence. In the legislation of Charlemagne there is an\r\nelaborate provision, by which a man convicted seven times of theft was\r\nno longer allowed to escape on payment of a fine, but was required to\r\nundergo the ordeal of fire. If he succumbed, he was put to death; if\r\nhe escaped unhurt, he was not discharged as innocent, but his lord was\r\nallowed to enter bail for his future good behavior[1250]—a mode at once\r\nof administering punishment and of ascertaining whether his death would\r\nbe agreeable to Heaven. When we thus regard it as a penalty on those\r\nwho by misconduct had forfeited the confidence of their fellow-men, the\r\nsystem loses part of its absurdity, in proportion as it departs from\r\nthe principle under which it was established.\r\n\r\nThere is also another aspect in which it is probable that the ordeal\r\nwas viewed by those whose common sense must have shrunk from it as a\r\nsimple appeal to the judgment of God. There can be little doubt that\r\nit was frequently found of material use in extorting confession or\r\nunwilling testimony. By the early codes, as in the primitive Greek and\r\nRoman law, torture could be applied only to slaves, and the ordeal was\r\na legalized torture, applied under circumstances peculiarly provocative\r\nof truth, and as such we occasionally find regulations which enable\r\nthe freeman to escape by compurgation, while the slave is required to\r\nundergo the ordeal.[1251] The elaborate nature of the ritual employed,\r\nwith its impressive adjurations and exorcisms, was well fitted to\r\nexcite the imagination and alarm the conscience; sometimes, indeed,\r\nto render it more effective, the mass celebrated was a mortuary one,\r\nwhich when sung for a living man was popularly believed to possess\r\ndeadly powers of peculiar efficacy.[1252] In those ages of faith,\r\nthe professing Christian, conscious of guilt, must indeed have been\r\nhardened who could undergo these awful rites, pledging his salvation\r\non his innocence, and knowing under such circumstances that the direct\r\nintervention of Heaven could alone save him from having his hand boiled\r\nto rags,[1253] after which he was to meet the full punishment of his\r\ncrime, and perhaps in addition lose a member for the perjury committed.\r\nWith such a prospect, all motives would conspire to lead him to a\r\nprompt and frank acknowledgment in the early stages of the proceedings\r\nagainst him. These views are strengthened by the fact that when, in\r\nthe thirteenth century, the judicial use of torture, as a means of\r\nobtaining testimony and confession, was becoming systematized and\r\ngenerally employed, the ordeal was falling into desuetude and rapidly\r\ndisappearing. The latter had fulfilled its mission, and the former was\r\na substitute better fitted for an age which reasoned more, believed\r\nless, and at the same time was quite as arbitrary and cruel as its\r\npredecessor. A further confirmation of this supposition is afforded by\r\nthe coincidence that the only primitive jurisprudence which excluded\r\nthe ordeal—that of the Wisigoths—was likewise the only one which\r\nhabitually permitted the use of torture,[1254] the only reference to\r\nthe ordeal in their code being a provision which directs its employment\r\nas a preliminary to the more regular forms of torture.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the ordeal was practically looked upon as a torture by those\r\nwhose enlightenment led them to regard as a superstition the faith\r\npopularly reposed in it. An epistle which is attributed both to Stephen\r\nV. and Sylvester II. condemns the whole system on the ground that the\r\ncanons forbid the extortion of confessions by heated irons and boiling\r\nwater; and that a credulous belief could not be allowed to sanction\r\nthat which was not permitted by the fathers.[1255] When, therefore,\r\nat the Council of St. Baseul, a priest named Adalger, in confessing\r\nthe assistance he had rendered to Arnoul of Reims during Charles of\r\nLorraine’s resistance to the usurpation of Hugh Capet, offered to\r\nsubstantiate his testimony by undergoing the ordeal, he did it in terms\r\nwhich show that he expected it to be regarded as a torture giving\r\nadditional weight to evidence—“If any of you doubt this and deem me\r\nunworthy of belief, let him believe the fire, the boiling water, the\r\nglowing iron. Let these tortures convince those who disbelieve my\r\nwords.”[1256] It is observable that he omits the cold-water as not\r\nbeing a torture, just as in the ancient Indian law the limitation\r\nreferred to above as applicable to the red-hot iron, the poison, and\r\nthe balance, did not apply to the cold-water ordeal, or to that in\r\nwhich was administered the water in which an idol had been dipped.[1257]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, some among the European ordeals, such as that of the\r\nEucharist, of bread and cheese, and bier-right, do not come within the\r\nclass of tortures, but they addressed themselves powerfully to the\r\nconscience and imagination of the accused, whose callous fortitude no\r\ndoubt often gave way under the trial. In our own country, and almost\r\nwithin our own time, the latter ordeal was revived in one instance\r\nwith this object, and the result did not disappoint the expectations\r\nof those who undertook it. In the case of People _vs._ Johnson, tried\r\nin New York in 1824, the suspected murderer was led from his cell to\r\nthe hospital where lay the body of the victim, which he was required\r\nto touch. Dissimulation which had been before unshaken failed him at\r\nthe awful moment; his overstrung nerves gave way, and a confession was\r\nfaltered forth. The proceeding was sustained by court, and a subsequent\r\nattempt at retraction was overruled.[1258] The powerful influence of\r\nsuch feelings is shown in a custom which, as recently as 1815, was\r\nstill employed at Mandeure, near Mont-belliard, and which is said to\r\nbe even yet in use in some of the remoter districts of the Ardennes.\r\nWhen a theft has been committed, the inhabitants are summoned to\r\nassemble after vespers on Sunday at the place of judgment. There the\r\nmayor calls upon the guilty person to make restitution and live in\r\nisolation for six months. If this appeal prove fruitless, recourse is\r\nhad to the trial of the staff, in which two magistrates hold aloft a\r\npiece of wood, under which every one is bound to pass. No instance, it\r\nis said, is on record in which the culprit dares to do this, and he is\r\nalways left alone.[1259] Very similar to this is the use made of the\r\nClog Oir or golden bell of St. Senan, the founder of the monastery of\r\nInniscattery, at the mouth of the river Shannon, which was supposed\r\nto have peculiar virtue in revealing culprits. A case occurred as\r\nlate as 1834, when a farmer, who had lost a sum of twenty pounds by a\r\nburglary, had the bell brought to his house with much ceremony, and\r\nthe following Sunday was appointed for the whole parish to appear and\r\nclear themselves upon it. On Saturday night, however, the stolen bank\r\nnotes were thrown through a window of his house.[1260] The method\r\ndescribed above (p. 334), as practised in Southern Russia to detect\r\nhousehold thieves, affords another example of the power exercised\r\nover a guilty conscience. It is easy thus to imagine how the other\r\nforms of ordeal may have conduced to the discovery of crime in ages\r\nof lively superstition. A case occurring about the commencement of\r\nthe twelfth century is a fair illustration of the manner in which it\r\nfrequently worked on the imagination of those whose lives or fortunes\r\nwere at stake. André de Trahent, a vassal of the convent of St. Mary\r\nof Saintes, claimed certain property belonging to the convent. On the\r\nfinal hearing it was decreed that he must abandon his claim unless\r\nhe could prove it by oath and ordeal. This he agreed to do, and on\r\nthe appointed day he appeared with his men ready to undergo the\r\ntrial. As there were two pieces of property in question, two ordeals\r\nwere required. The caldrons of water were duly heated and André’s\r\nmen were prepared for the attempt, when his courage gave way; he\r\nabruptly abandoned his claim and submitted himself to the mercy of the\r\nabbess.[1261]\r\n\r\nThis case illustrates the fact that in the vulgar ordeals as well as in\r\nthe duel champions were sometimes allowed. To how great an extent this\r\nwas permitted it would now be difficult to assert. It is not specially\r\nalluded to in any body of laws, but numerous examples of it have been\r\nincidentally given above, and in some of the _ordines_ it is assumed as\r\na matter of course. In one for the cold-water ordeal the substitutes\r\nare described as children who are made to fast for forty days in\r\nadvance, and carefully watched and washed to prevent any illusions\r\nof the devil.[1262] In the ordeal of the cross, however, it was a\r\nrecognized privilege of the old or infirm to put forward a substitute,\r\nand when communities or churches were pleaders a champion was of course\r\na necessity. A still greater relaxation, occasionally permitted but\r\nnot approved by the Church, was the practice of writing the name of\r\nthe accused on paper or some other substance and submitting this to\r\nthe ordeal in place of the individual himself.[1263] Perhaps the most\r\nillogical use of a champion in an ordeal is one suggested by Hincmar of\r\nReims in 860, that a satisfactory person should undergo it in order to\r\ndetermine whether the secret motive alleged by another person for not\r\nliving with his wife were true or not.[1264]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THE ORDEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degree of confidence really inspired by the results of the ordeal\r\nis a somewhat curious subject of speculation on which definite opinions\r\nare not easily reached. Judicially, the trial was, for the most part,\r\nconclusive; he who had duly sunk under water, walked unharmed among\r\nthe burning shares, or withdrawn an unblistered hand from a caldron of\r\nlegal temperature, stood forth among his fellows as innocent. So, even\r\nnow, the verdict of a few fools or knaves in a jury-box may discharge a\r\ncriminal, against the plainest dictates of common sense, but in neither\r\ncase would the sentiments of the community be probably changed by the\r\nresult. The reverential feelings which alone could impart faith in\r\nthe system seem scarcely compatible with the practice of compounding\r\nfor ordeals, which, as we have seen above (p. 384), was occasionally\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, at the commencement of his reign, does not seem to have\r\nentertained much respect for the judgment of God when he prescribed\r\nthe administration of the ordeal for trifling affairs only, cases\r\nof magnitude being reserved for the regular investigation of the\r\nlaw.[1265] Thirty years later, the public mind appears afflicted with\r\nthe same doubts, for we find the monarch endeavoring to enforce\r\nconfidence in the system by his commands.[1266] The repeated use of\r\nthe ordeal in the affair of the divorce of Teutberga shows that it was\r\nexpected to have no little effect on public opinion, and the same is\r\nseen when in 876 Charlemagne’s grandson, Louis of Saxony, forced to\r\ndefend his dominions against his uncle Charles le Chauve, commenced\r\nby proving the justness of his title by the judgment of God. After\r\nfasting and prayer ten of his followers were exposed to the ordeal\r\nof red-hot iron and ten each to those of cold and boiling water; all\r\nescaped without injury, and the righteousness of the verdict was shown\r\nsoon after by the victory of Andernach, which sent the invader flying\r\nback to France.[1267] Yet a rule of English law, nearly four hundred\r\nyears later, during the expiring struggles of the practice, would show\r\nthat the result was regarded as by no means conclusive. By the assizes\r\nof Clarendon in 1166, which directed that all malefactors defamed for\r\nmurder, robbery, and other felonies should be at once tried by the\r\nwater ordeal, it was provided that those who had confessed or who had\r\nbeen found in possession of stolen property should not be allowed the\r\nprivilege of clearing themselves in this manner; and a still more\r\nirreverential rule decreed that those who were pronounced innocent by\r\nthe judgment of God, if regarded as guilty by common report, should\r\nhave eight days to quit the kingdom, under pain of outlawry.[1268] In\r\nthe revision of these laws, made at Northampton ten years later, it was\r\nprovided that in all cases those who passed safely through the ordeal\r\nshould give bail for their future good conduct, except in charges of\r\nmurder or aggravated felony, when they were banished within forty\r\ndays, under penalty of outlawry as before.[1269]\r\n\r\nSt. Ivo of Chartres, though he had no scruple in recommending and\r\nenjoining the ordeal for laymen, and, on one occasion at least,\r\npronounced its decisions as beyond appeal, yet has placed on record his\r\nconviction of its insufficiency, and his experience that the mysterious\r\njudgment of God not infrequently allowed in this manner the guilty to\r\nescape and the innocent to be punished.[1270] A case related by Peter\r\nCantor in the twelfth century shows how recklessly it often was abused\r\nas a relief to careless judges in doubtful cases. Two Englishmen were\r\nreturning in company from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, when one of\r\nthem wandered off to the shrine of St. Jago de Compostella, and the\r\nother went directly home. The kindred of the absent one accused the\r\nlatter of murdering his companion; as no evidence was procurable on\r\neither side, he was hurried to the ordeal, convicted, and executed,\r\nshortly after which the missing man came back in safety.[1271]\r\n\r\nThe manifest injustice of the decisions thus rendered by the ordeal put\r\na severe strain on the faith of believers, and led them to the most\r\ningenious sophistry for an explanation. When, in 1127, the sacrilegious\r\nmurder of Charles the Good, Count of Flanders, sent a thrill of\r\nhorror throughout Europe, Lambert of Redenberg, whose participation\r\nin the crime was notorious, succeeded in clearing himself by the hot\r\niron. Shortly afterwards he undertook the siege of Ostbourg, which\r\nhe prosecuted with great cruelty, when he was killed in a sally of\r\nthe besieged. The pious Galbert assumes that Lambert, notwithstanding\r\nhis guilt, escaped at the ordeal in consequence of his humility and\r\nrepentance, and philosophically adds: “Thus it is that in battle the\r\nunjust man is killed, although in the ordeal of water or of fire he may\r\nescape, if truly repentant.”[1272] The same doctrine was enunciated\r\nunder John Cantacuzenes, in the middle of the fourteenth century, by\r\na bishop of Didymoteichos in Thrace. A frail fair one being violently\r\nsuspected by her husband, the ordeal of hot iron was demanded by him.\r\nIn this strait she applied to the good bishop, and he, being convinced\r\nof her repentance and intention to sin no more, assured her that in\r\nsuch a frame of mind she might safely venture on the trial, and she\r\naccordingly carried the glowing bar triumphantly twice around the\r\nbishop’s chair, to the entire satisfaction of her lord and master.[1273]\r\n\r\nIn fact it was a recognized doctrine of the Church that confession,\r\ncontrition, and absolution so thoroughly washed away a sin that\r\na culprit thus prepared could safely tempt the justice of God. A\r\ncase related by Cæsarius of Heisterbach as a most edifying example\r\nillustrates the curious nature of the superstition thus inculcated\r\nby the religious teachers of the period. In the diocese of Utrecht a\r\nfisherman notoriously maintained illicit relations with a woman, and\r\nfearing to be called to account for it by an approaching synod, where\r\nhe would be convicted by the red-hot iron, and be forced to marry her,\r\nhe consulted a priest. This ghostly counsellor advised him that, if he\r\nwas firmly resolved to sin no more, he could safely deny the fact and\r\nendure the ordeal, after receiving absolution. The event verified the\r\nprediction; he carried the burning iron unhurt, and to the surprise\r\nof all the country round he was acquitted. Shortly afterwards, while\r\nin his boat, a companion expressed his wonder, when the fisherman,\r\nwhose short-lived repentance was already over, boastingly struck his\r\nhand on the water, exclaiming, “It hurt me no more than that!” By the\r\nmarvellous justice of God, the water was to him as red-hot iron, and\r\nas he hastily withdrew his hand the skin peeled off in strips.[1274]\r\nEven as late as 1539, the learned Ciruelo reproves the use of ordeals\r\nbecause the accused, though innocent of the special crime at issue, may\r\nsuccumb in consequence of other offences; or though guilty may escape\r\nbecause he has confessed and received absolution; and he states that he\r\nhad personally known more than one case in which women, rightly accused\r\nof adultery by their husbands and forced to undergo the ordeal, had\r\nthus succeeded in being acquitted.[1275]\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of Ciruelo’s that the innocent were sometimes liable to\r\nconviction on account of previous misdeeds was likewise a belief of old\r\nstanding. We have already seen (p. 137) that there was papal authority\r\nfor it in the wager of battle. A striking instance of the vague notions\r\ncurrent is afforded in the middle of the eleventh century by a case\r\nrelated by Othlonus, in which a man accused of horse-stealing was tried\r\nby the cold-water ordeal and found guilty. Knowing his own innocence,\r\nhe appealed to the surrounding monks, and was told that it must be in\r\nconsequence of some other sin not properly redeemed by penance. As he\r\nhad confessed and received absolution before the trial, he denied this,\r\ntill one of them pointed out that in place of allowing his beard to\r\ngrow, as was meet for a layman, he had impiously carried the smooth\r\nchin reserved for ecclesiastics. Confessing his guilt, promising due\r\npenance, and vowing never to touch his beard with a razor again, he\r\nwas conducted a second time to the water, and being now free from all\r\nunrepented sin, he was triumphantly acquitted. It is added that, taking\r\nadvantage of a quibble as to the kind of instrument employed, he lapsed\r\nagain into the sin of shaving, when the anger of Heaven manifested\r\nitself by allowing him to fall into the hands of an enemy, who put out\r\nhis eyes.[1276]\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, the ordeal sometimes was regarded as the most\r\nsatisfactory kind of proof, entitled to respect beyond any other\r\nspecies of evidence. The age was not logical, men acted more from\r\nimpulse than from reason, and the forms of jurisprudence were still\r\nin a state too chaotic for regular and invariable rules to be laid\r\ndown. The confusion existing in the popular mind is well illustrated\r\nby a case occurring in the twelfth century. A serf of the Abbey of\r\nMarmoutiers married a serf who had been given by the Viscount of\r\nBlois to one of his retainers named Erbald. The husband purchased\r\nhis wife’s liberty, and by paying an additional sum had the deed of\r\nmanumission confirmed by the viscount and viscountess. Years passed\r\naway, the serf and wife died, and then also their son, when their\r\nproperty fell to the abbey, which enjoyed it until the heirs of\r\nErbald and the viscount claimed it. The monks produced the deeds of\r\nmanumission, and the viscountess, then the only surviving witness to\r\nthe transaction, testified to its authenticity, but to no purpose. The\r\nclaimants demanded the wager of battle, and the monks, in refusing\r\nthis as unsuited to their calling, were obliged to produce a man who\r\noffered to undergo the ordeal of red-hot iron to prove the validity of\r\nthe deed. Then the claimants at last desisted, but still succeeded in\r\nextorting sixteen livres from the abbey as the price of appending their\r\nsignatures to the controverted deed.[1277]\r\n\r\nIn general, however, as the result depended mostly upon those who\r\nadministered the ordeal, it conferred an irresponsible power to release\r\nor to condemn, and it would be expecting too much of human nature\r\nto suppose that men did not yield frequently to the temptation to\r\nabuse that power. When Sigurd Thorlaksson was accused by Saint Olaf\r\nthe King of the murder of his foster-brother Thoralf, and offered to\r\nclear himself by the red-hot iron, King Olaf accepted his offer, and\r\nappointed the next day for the trial at Lygra, where the bishop was\r\nto preside over it. When Sigurd went back at night to his ship, he\r\nsaid to his comrades that their prospects were gloomy, for the king\r\nhad probably caused himself the death of Thoralf, and then brought\r\nthe accusation against them, adding, “For him, it is an easy matter\r\nto manage the iron ordeal so that I doubt he will come ill off who\r\ntries it against him;” whereupon they hoisted sail in the darkness and\r\nescaped to their home in the Faroe Islands.[1278] The collusion thus\r\nhinted at must often have been practised, and must have shaken the most\r\nrobust faith, and this cause of disbelief would receive additional\r\nstrength from the fact that the result itself was not seldom in doubt,\r\nvictory being equally claimed by both parties. Of this we have already\r\nseen examples in the affairs of the lance of St. Andrew and of the\r\nArchbishop of Milan, and somewhat similar is an incident recorded by\r\nthe Bollandists in the life of St. Swithin, in which, by miraculous\r\ninterposition, the opposing parties beheld entirely different results\r\nfrom an appeal to the red-hot iron.[1279]\r\n\r\nEfforts of course were made from time to time to preserve the purity\r\nof the appeal, and to secure impartiality in its application. Clotair\r\nII., in 595, directs that three chosen persons shall attend on each\r\nside to prevent collusion;[1280] and among the Anglo-Saxons, some four\r\nhundred years later, Ethelred enjoins the presence of the prosecutor\r\nunder penalty of loss of suit and fine of twenty _ores_, apparently for\r\nthe same object, as well as to give authenticity to the decision.[1281]\r\nSo in Hungary, the laws of St. Ladislas, in 1092, direct that three\r\nsworn witnesses shall be present to attest the innocence or guilt of\r\nthe accused as demonstrated by the result.[1282] A rule announced by\r\nthe Council of Grateley in 928, that if the accused is accompanied by\r\nmore than twelve comrades he shall be adjudged as though he had failed\r\nin the ordeal, points to an obvious source of miscarriage of justice\r\nby which a crowd of partisans could interfere with the proceedings and\r\nthen proclaim that the result had been successful.[1283] A law adopted\r\nby the Scottish Parliament under William the Lion, in the second\r\nhalf of the twelfth century, shows that corruption was not uncommon,\r\nby forbidding those concerned in the administration of ordeals from\r\nreceiving bribes to divert the course of justice,[1284] and a further\r\nprecaution was taken by prohibiting the Barons from adjudging the\r\nordeal without the intervention of the sheriff to see that law and\r\njustice were observed.[1285]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that we have seen, the ordeal, with its undoubted\r\ncruelty, was not as cruel as it appears to us, and in its practical\r\nresults it probably acquitted the guilty far more often than it\r\nconvicted the innocent. Mr. Maitland tells us that in his researches\r\nin the English records from 1201 till the abolition of the ordeal in\r\n1219—a period in which, as stated above (p. 387), it was in constant\r\nuse—he has found but one instance in which it failed to clear the\r\naccused.[1286] It is true that the cold-water ordeal was the one most\r\nfreely resorted to, but the red-hot iron was also freely employed, and\r\nthe one case of failure occurred in the water ordeal. At this distance\r\nof time it would be useless to frame a positive explanation of this,\r\nalthough bribery and collusion of course naturally suggest themselves\r\nin the notorious and almost universal corruption of the period.\r\nContemporaries reconciled themselves to this as best they could, but\r\nwhile relying comfortably upon the inscrutable judgment of God, and the\r\npreservative power of contrition and confession, they were not without\r\nother solutions of the problem.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the judicial duel magic arts were popularly\r\nsupposed to have power to control the interposition of God. This was\r\nlikewise the case with the vulgar ordeals, and in addition a special\r\npower was attributed to the use or abuse of the holy chrism. The\r\nCouncil of Tours, in 813, informs us that it was generally believed\r\nthat a criminal who drank the chrism or anointed himself with it could\r\nnot be convicted by any ordeal.[1287] So serious indeed was this\r\nconsidered that Charlemagne in 809 decreed that a priest giving out the\r\nchrism for this purpose should not only be degraded but should lose a\r\nhand—a law which long continued in force, nominally at least.[1288]\r\nThe belief was not ephemeral, for until the early part of the twelfth\r\ncentury a canon was carried through all the collections which speaks\r\nof the matter as a fact proved by experience.[1289] The superstition\r\nprobably died out towards the middle of the century when the number\r\nof sacraments was increased from three to seven, and the comparative\r\nimportance of the chrism was thus diminished in the popular eyes. The\r\nbelief that the judgment of God could be perverted or eluded by magic\r\narts still continued, however, and precautions were commonly taken to\r\nprevent their use.[1290] Holy water, moreover, was lavishly sprinkled\r\non the materials employed in the ordeal and on the patient, and was\r\ngiven to him to drink to prevent diabolic illusions by which it was\r\nimagined that the purposes of God could be defeated.[1291]\r\n\r\nPrecautions also were taken to guard against processes by which, in the\r\nfire ordeals, it was believed that the human frame could be rendered\r\nincombustible, and for this object a widely prevailing custom required\r\nthat for three days previous the hand should be wrapped up to guard\r\nagainst its being thus fortified.[1292] The nature of these unguents\r\nmay be guessed from a prescription given by Albertus Magnus, consisting\r\nof mallow and radish juice, white of egg, lime, and “psillus” seeds,\r\nthe use of which he assures us will enable a man with impunity to enter\r\nthe flames or to carry red-hot iron.[1293] Doubtless reliance on some\r\nsuch expedients may partially explain the readiness with which the\r\nordeal was undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AND THE ORDEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Church to the vulgar ordeals presents even a more\r\ncomplex question than that which has already been discussed of its\r\nconnection with the judicial combat. The ordeals were less repugnant to\r\nits teachings and more completely dependent upon its ministrations, for\r\nwhile a duel might be fought without the aid of a priest the efficacy\r\nof an ordeal depended wholly upon the religious rites which gave it\r\nthe sanction of a direct invocation of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nWe have seen above that the Church readily accepted the pagan practices\r\nof its Barbarian converts, and gave them fresh claim to confidence by\r\nsurrounding them with the most impressive solemnities of the faith.\r\nNotwithstanding the worldly advantage derivable from this policy,\r\nthere were some minds superior to the superstition or the cunning of\r\ntheir fellows. Even as early as the commencement of the sixth century,\r\nAvitus, Bishop of Vienne, remonstrated freely with Gundobald on account\r\nof the prominence given to the battle ordeal in the Burgundian code;\r\nand some three centuries later, St. Agobard, Archbishop of Lyons,\r\nattacked the whole system in two powerful treatises, which in many\r\npoints display a breadth of view and clearness of reasoning far in\r\nadvance of his age.[1294] Shortly after this we find an echo of these\r\narguments in some utterances of the papacy, such as the disapproval\r\nof the lot by Leo IV. (p. 353), of the duel by Nicholas I. (p. 207),\r\nand the more general condemnation by Stephen V. (p. 395), while on the\r\nother hand we have seen (p. 382) the ordeal adopted by Stephen VII. in\r\nthe trial of his predecessor Formosus.\r\n\r\nWhether the Holy See condemned or approved the judgment of God was a\r\nmatter of the utmost indifference to the Church at large. The universal\r\nuse of the ordeal, involving as it did the indispensable employment\r\nof priestly ministrations, shows sufficiently that no ecclesiastic\r\nhesitated to sanction it, and that practically it had the universal\r\nsympathy and support of the Church. Nor was this left to be merely\r\na matter of inference, for the local churches had no scruple in\r\nadvocating and prescribing it in the most authoritative manner. In\r\n799 the Council of Salzburg ordered the red-hot iron for the trial of\r\nwitches and necromancers.[1295] In 810, Ahyto, Bishop of Basle, could\r\nsuggest no other mode of determining doubtful cases of consanguinity\r\nbetween husband and wife.[1296] In 853, the Synod of Soissons ordered\r\nBurchard, Bishop of Chartres, to prove his fitness for the episcopal\r\noffice by undergoing the ordeal.[1297] Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims,\r\nlent to it all the influence of his commanding talents and position;\r\nthe Council of Mainz in 888, and that of Tribur near Mainz in 895,\r\nrecommended it; that of Tours in 925 ordered it for the decision of a\r\nquarrel between two priests respecting certain tithes;[1298] the synod\r\nof the province of Mainz in 1028 authorized the hot iron in a case of\r\nmurder;[1299] that of Elne in 1065 recognized it; that of Auch in 1068\r\nconfirmed its use; a penitential of the same period in Bohemia ordered\r\nthe ordeal for those who pleaded ignorance when accused of marrying\r\nwithin the prohibited degrees;[1300] Burckhardt, Bishop of Worms, whose\r\ncollection of canons enjoyed high authority, in 1023 assisted at the\r\nCouncil of Selingenstadt, which directed its employment, and in his\r\npenitential he prescribes five years’ penance for endeavoring by magic\r\narts to escape conviction by it—a practice which, as we have seen,\r\nwas not uncommon.[1301] The synod of Gran, in 1099, decided that the\r\nordeal of hot iron might be administered during Lent, except in cases\r\ninvolving the shedding of blood.[1302] Moreover, we find St. Bernard\r\nalluding approvingly to the conviction and martyrdom of heretics by\r\nthe cold-water process,[1303] of which Guibert de Nogent gives us an\r\ninstance wherein he aided the Bishop of Soissons in administering it\r\nto two backsliders with complete success.[1304] In 1157 the red-hot\r\niron ordeal was prescribed by the Council of Reims for all persons\r\naccused of belonging to the fast-growing sect of the Cathari or\r\nManichæans, whose progress was alarming the Church;[1305] and in 1167\r\ntwo heretics at Vezelai were tried by cold water in the presence of\r\nthe Archbishop of Lyons and two bishops, when, singularly enough, they\r\nescaped.[1306] In 1172 a learned clerk named Robert was involved in a\r\ndebate with a knight on the delicate question whether the Eucharist\r\nbecame corrupted when voided from the body: he was accused as a heretic\r\nto the Bishop of Arras, who called in the Archbishop of Reims and\r\nnumerous clerks to try him. Robert was so confident of his innocence\r\nthat he offered to undergo the hot-iron ordeal, but his guilt was\r\nmiraculously shown when burns appeared not only on the right hand that\r\ncarried the iron, but also on the left hand, on both feet, both sides\r\nand on his chest and belly, wherefore he was promptly burned alive as\r\na heretic.[1307] Other cases, moreover, are related by Peter Cantor,\r\nin which good Catholics were successfully convicted of heresy in this\r\nmanner, and one instance presents a curious view of the singular\r\nconfusion which existed in judicial logic at the time. A poor fellow\r\nwho professed the most entire orthodoxy, and against whom there was no\r\nproof, was ordered to carry the red-hot iron. This he refused unless\r\nthe assembled bishops would prove that he could do so without incurring\r\nmortal sin by tempting God. This they were unable to accomplish, so all\r\nunpleasant doubts were settled by promptly having him burnt.[1308] Even\r\nafter the Lateran Council of 1215, some miracles related by Cæsarius of\r\nHeisterbach show that the conviction of heretics by the hot iron was\r\nregarded as a matter of course,[1309] and a penitential of a somewhat\r\nlater period complains that suspected heretics on trial had no other\r\nmeans of proving their orthodoxy or their conversion to the true faith.\r\nIt also mentions a curious custom prevalent in some places that where\r\nthere was doubt as to a man having died in grace, his friends had to\r\nprove his penitence by undergoing the cold-water ordeal before he was\r\nadmitted to Christian sepulture.[1310]\r\n\r\nPrelates, moreover, were everywhere found granting charters containing\r\nthe privilege of conducting trials in this manner. It was sometimes\r\nspecially appropriated to members of the Church, who claimed it, under\r\nthe name of _Lex Monachorum_, as a class privilege exempting them\r\nfrom being parties to the more barbarous and uncanonical wager of\r\nbattle,[1311] and in 1061 a charter of John, Bishop of Avranches, to\r\nthe Abbot of Mont S. Michel, alludes to hot water and iron as the only\r\nmode of trying priests charged with offences of magnitude.[1312] St.\r\nIvo of Chartres, who denied the liability of churchmen to the ordeal,\r\nadmitted that it could be properly used on laymen, and even pronounces\r\nits result to be beyond appeal.[1313] Pope Calixtus II. in 1119 gave\r\nhis sanction to it at the Council of Reims, and soon afterwards at\r\nthe Council of Chartres he admitted the red-hot iron to decide a\r\ncase of alleged violation of the right of asylum in a church.[1314]\r\nAbout the same time the learned priest, Honorius of Autun, specifies\r\nthe benediction of the iron and water of the ordeal as part of the\r\nlegitimate functions of his order;[1315] and even Gratian, in 1151,\r\nhesitates to condemn the whole system, preferring to consider the\r\ncanon of Stephen V. as prohibiting only the ordeals of hot water and\r\niron.[1316]\r\n\r\nThe Church, in fact, lent its most impressive ceremonies to enhance\r\nthe effect on the popular mind of these trials. An _Ordo_ or Ritual,\r\nof about the year 1100, informs us that when any one accused of theft\r\nor adultery or other crime refused to confess, the priest was to go to\r\nthe church, put on his sacred vestments, except the chasuble, and then,\r\nholding the gospels and chrismatory, the chalice and paten and relics\r\nof saints, he from the vestibule summoned the people, while forbidding\r\nthe accused, if guilty, and any of his accomplices to enter. At the\r\nsame time he designated the spot in the vestibule where the fire was\r\nto be built to heat the caldron or the ploughshares, and sprinkled\r\nthem all with holy water to prevent diabolical illusions. Then the\r\naccused entered. He was first required to forgive all offences as he\r\nhoped for pardon; he made confession of his sins and accepted penance,\r\nwhile the penitential psalms were sung customary for penitents on Ash\r\nWednesday; if there was suspicion as to his faith he was made to swear\r\non the altar his reliance on God rather than on the devil to manifest\r\nhis innocence in the ordeal. Mass was then celebrated and communion\r\nwas administered to him under the tremendous adjuration, “May the body\r\nand blood of our Lord Jesus Christ be unto thee a proof!” After this\r\nthe priest led the people to the spot where the trial was to take\r\nplace. Prayers were uttered to God to render judgment, litanies and\r\npsalms were sung, the material of the ordeal, whether iron or hot or\r\ncold water, was blessed with an adjuration that it would be the means\r\nof rendering a just verdict, and the accused was exorcised with an\r\nadjuration to abandon the trial if he was conscious of guilt. Then the\r\noath was administered to him, and he took hold of the glowing iron, or\r\nplunged his hand into the seething caldron, or was bound and cast into\r\nthe water. Nothing was omitted that would add to the effectiveness of\r\nthe prolonged ritual, and throughout it was in the hands of the priest;\r\nthe secular tribunal effaced itself and abandoned the whole conduct of\r\nthe affair to the Church.[1317]\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the papacy ranged itself in opposition to the\r\nordeal. After a silence of nearly two centuries, Alexander II., about\r\n1070, denounced it as a popular invention, destitute of canonical\r\nauthority, and forbade its use for ecclesiastics.[1318] This was a\r\nclaim which had already in the eighth century been advanced in England\r\nby Ecgbehrt, Archbishop of York, who piously declared that their oath\r\non the cross was sufficient for acquittal, and that if guilty their\r\npunishment must be left to God.[1319] About the year 1000, St. Abbo\r\nof Fleury revived this assertion of exemption,[1320] and a century\r\nlater St. Ivo of Chartres insisted on it.[1321] As we have seen, these\r\ndemands for clerical immunity were wholly disregarded, but they serve\r\nas a key to the motive of the papal opposition to the ordeal which\r\ndeveloped itself so rapidly in the second half of the twelfth century.\r\nThe Church had long sought, with little practical result, to emancipate\r\nthe clergy from subjection to the secular law. This was one of the\r\nleading objects of the forgers of the Pseudo-Isidorian decretals; it\r\nhad met with promising success at the time;[1322] in the confusion\r\nof the tenth and eleventh centuries it had well-nigh been forgotten,\r\nbut now it was revived and insisted on with a persistent energy which\r\nwon the victory in the thirteenth century. When this point was gained\r\nand ecclesiastics were relieved from ordeals and duels, the next step\r\nwas inevitably to extend the prohibition to the laity. The papal\r\nbattle was really fought for the advantage of the clergy, but the\r\nclergy was ranged in opposition because the prospective benefit seemed\r\ninadequate to compensate for present loss. The local churches found in\r\nthe administration of the ordeal a source of power and profit which\r\nnaturally rendered them unwilling to abandon it at the papal mandate.\r\nChartered privileges had accumulated around it, such as we have already\r\nseen in the case of the judicial duel, and these privileges were shared\r\nor held by prelates and churches and monasteries. Thus in 1148 we find\r\nThibaut the Great of Champagne making over to the church of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen the exclusive right of administering the oaths required on\r\nsuch occasions in the town of Chateaudun;[1323] and in 1182 the Vicomte\r\nde Béarn conferred on the Abbey de la Seauve the revenue arising from\r\nthe marble basin used for the trial by boiling water at Gavarret.[1324]\r\nIn the statutes of King Coloman of Hungary, collected in 1099, there is\r\na provision prohibiting the administration of the ordeal in the smaller\r\nchurches, and reserving the privilege to the cathedral seats and other\r\nimportant establishments.[1325]\r\n\r\nAccording to a grant from Péregrin de Lavedan to the monastery of\r\nSaint-Pé, in Bigorre, the fee for administering the hot-water ordeal\r\nwas five crowns, of which two were paid to the monastery, two to the\r\ncathedral at Tarbes, and one to the priest who blessed the water and\r\nstone.[1326] By the laws of St. Ladislas of Hungary, in 1092, the\r\nstipend of the officiating priest for the red-hot iron was double that\r\nwhich he received for the water ordeal;[1327] in Bohemia the laws of\r\nOtto Premizlas in 1229 give the priest a fee of fourteen deniers for\r\nthe latter.[1328] How rigidly these rights were enforced is shown in\r\na case related by Peter Cantor in the twelfth century. A man accused\r\nof crime was sentenced to undergo the ordeal of cold water. When\r\nstripped and bound and seated on the edge of the tank, the prosecutor\r\nwithdrew the suit, but the official of the court refused to release the\r\naccused until he should pay fees amounting to nine livres and a half.\r\nA long wrangle ensued, until the defendant declared that he would pay\r\nnothing, but would rather undergo the ordeal, and, after establishing\r\nhis innocence, would give fifty sols to the poor. He was accordingly\r\nthrown in and sank satisfactorily, but on being drawn out was met with\r\na fresh claim from the officiating priest, of five sols, for blessing\r\nthe water.[1329]\r\n\r\nAs these fees were paid, sometimes on conviction and sometimes on\r\nacquittal, there was danger that, even without direct bribery,\r\nself-interest might affect the result. Thus by the acts of the Synod\r\nof Lillebonne, in 1080, a conviction by the hot-iron ordeal entailed\r\na fine for the benefit of the bishop;[1330] and it was apparently to\r\nprevent such influences that the Swedish code, compiled by Andreas\r\nArchbishop of Lunden early in the thirteenth century, made the\r\nsuccessful party, whether the prosecutor or defendant, pay the fee\r\nto the officiating priest—a regulation sufficiently degrading to the\r\nsacerdotal character.[1331] But besides these pecuniary advantages,\r\nthe ordeal had a natural attraction to the clergy, as it afforded the\r\nmeans of awing the laity, by rendering the priest a special instrument\r\nof Divine justice, into whose hands every man felt that he was at any\r\nmoment liable to fall; while, to the unworthy, its attractions were\r\nenhanced by the opportunities which it gave for the worst abuses. From\r\nthe decretals of Alexander III. we learn authoritatively that the\r\nextortion of money from innocent persons by its instrumentality was a\r\nnotorious fact[1332]—a testimony confirmed by Ekkehardus Junior, who,\r\na century earlier, makes the same accusation, and moreover inveighs\r\nbitterly against the priests who were wont to gratify the vilest\r\ninstincts in stripping women for the purpose of exposing them to the\r\nordeal of cold water.[1333]\r\n\r\nWith all these influences, moral and material, to give to the local\r\nclergy a direct interest in the maintenance of the ordeal, it is no\r\nwonder that they battled resolutely for its preservation. In this,\r\nhowever, as in so many other details of ecclesiastical policy,\r\ncentralization triumphed. When the papal authority reached its\r\nculminating point, a vigorous and sustained effort to abolish the\r\nwhole system was made by the popes who occupied the pontifical throne\r\nfrom 1159 to 1227. Nothing can be more peremptory than the prohibition\r\nuttered by Alexander III.,[1334] who sought moreover to enlist on his\r\nside the local churches by stigmatizing as an intolerable abuse the\r\nliability which in Sweden forced the highest prelates to submit to the\r\nred-hot iron ordeal.[1335] About the same time we find the celebrated\r\nPeter Cantor earnestly urging that it was a sinful tempting of God and\r\na most uncertain means of administering justice, which he enforces by\r\nnumerous instances of innocent persons who, within his own knowledge,\r\nhad been condemned by its means and put to death; and he declares\r\nthat any priest exorcising the iron or water, or administering the\r\noaths preliminary to the judicial duel, is guilty of mortal sin.[1336]\r\nSomewhat earlier than this, Ekkehard Bishop of Munster took the same\r\nground when he refused to his steward Richmar permission to undergo the\r\nred-hot iron ordeal in order to convert the Jew, Hermann of Cologne;\r\nit would be, he said, a tempting of God.[1337] A different reason was\r\ngiven when Albero, a priest of Mercke near Cologne, offered to pass\r\nthrough fire to prove the orthodoxy of his teaching that the sacraments\r\nwere vitiated in the hands of sinful priests, and his request was\r\nrefused on the ground that skilful sorcery might thus lead to the\r\nsuccess of a flagrant heresy.[1338] In 1181, Lucius III. pronounced\r\nnull and void the acquittal of a priest charged with homicide, who had\r\nundergone the water ordeal, and ordered him to prove his innocence with\r\ncompurgators, giving as a reason that all such “peregrina judicia”\r\nwere prohibited.[1339] Even more severe was the blow administered by\r\nInnocent III. early in the thirteenth century. At Albenga, near Genoa,\r\na man suspected of theft offered to prove his innocence by the red-hot\r\niron, and agreed to be hanged if he should fail. The ordeal took place\r\nin the presence of the bishop and judge; the man’s hand was burnt and\r\nafter some consultation the bishop ordered him to be hanged. When\r\nInnocent heard of this he promptly had the bishop deprived of his see\r\nand a successor elected; his decision in this case was carried into\r\nthe canon law as a precedent to be followed.[1340] In 1210, moreover,\r\nwhen Bishop Henry of Strassburg was vigorously persecuting heresy and\r\nconvicting heretics by the ordeal, one of them named Reinhold hurried\r\nto Rome and returned with a letter from Innocent forbidding it for the\r\nfuture; ordeals might be adjudged, he said, by the secular tribunals,\r\nbut they were not admissible in ecclesiastical judgments.[1341] Still\r\nmore effective was his action when, under his impulsion, the Fourth\r\nCouncil of Lateran, in 1215, formally forbade the employment of any\r\necclesiastical ceremonies in such trials.[1342] As the moral influence\r\nof the ordeal depended entirely upon its religious associations, a\r\nstrict observance of this canon must speedily have swept the whole\r\nsystem into oblivion. Yet shortly after this we find the inquisitor\r\nConrad of Marburg employing in Germany the red-hot iron as a means of\r\ncondemning his unfortunate victims by wholesale, and the chronicler\r\nrelates that, whether innocent or guilty, few escaped the test.[1343]\r\nThe canon of Lateran, however, was actively followed up by the papal\r\nlegates, and the system may consequently be considered to have fairly\r\nentered on its decline.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Church was concerned its condemnation was irrevocable.\r\nBy this time the papacy had become the supreme and unquestioned\r\nlegislator. The compilation of papal decrees known as the Decretals\r\nof Gregory IX., issued in 1234, was everywhere accepted as the “new\r\nlaw” of binding force, and in it the compiler, St. Ramon de Peñafort,\r\nhad sedulously inserted the prohibitions so repeatedly issued during\r\nthe preceding three-quarters of a century. These prohibitions were no\r\nlonger construed as limited to ecclesiastics; the whole system was\r\ncondemned. St. Ramon himself in his _Summa_, which had immense and\r\nlasting authority, had no hesitation in denouncing all ordeals as an\r\naccursed invention of the devil.[1344] His contemporary, Alexander\r\nHales, whose reputation as a theologian stood unrivalled, after\r\npresenting the arguments on both sides, concludes that they are wholly\r\nto be rejected.[1345] Soon afterwards Cardinal Henry of Susa, the\r\nleading canonist of his day, gave a severer blow by proving that as\r\nordeals are illegal all sentences rendered by their means are null and\r\nvoid.[1346] Still the practice was hard to suppress, for at the end of\r\nthe century we find John of Freiburg denouncing it as forbidden and\r\naccursed; bishops and abbots permitting ordeals in their courts are\r\nguilty of mortal sin, and preachers should denounce them from their\r\npulpits with all due modesty.[1347] This shows that the spiritual\r\nlords were still deaf to the voice of the papacy, but the principle\r\nwas settled and in 1317 Astesanus, whose authority was of the highest,\r\ntreats the whole system of duels and ordeals as mere appeals to chance,\r\nhaving no warrant in divine law and forbidden by the Church.[1348] This\r\nattitude was consistently preserved, and Gregory XI. in 1374, when\r\ncondemning the Sachsenspiegel, enumerated, among other objectionable\r\nfeatures, its provisions of this nature as contrary to the canon law\r\nand a tempting of God.[1349]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nREPRESSIVE SECULAR LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlightened legislators were not slow in seconding the efforts of the\r\npapacy. Perhaps the earliest instance of secular legislation directed\r\nagainst the ordeal, except some charters granted to communes, is an\r\nedict of Philip Augustus in 1200, bestowing certain privileges on the\r\nscholars of the University of Paris, by which he ordered that a citizen\r\naccused of assaulting a student shall not be allowed to defend himself\r\neither by the duel or the water ordeal.[1350] In England, a rescript of\r\nHenry III., dated January 27, 1219, directs the judges then starting on\r\ntheir circuits to employ other modes of proof—“seeing that the judgment\r\nof fire and water is forbidden by the Church of Rome.”[1351] A few\r\ncharters and confirmations, dated some years subsequently, allude to\r\nthe privilege of administering it; but Matthew of Westminster, when\r\nenumerating, under date of 1250, the remarkable events of the half\r\ncentury, specifies its abrogation as one of the occurrences to be\r\nnoted,[1352] and we may conclude that thenceforth it was practically\r\nabandoned throughout the kingdom. This is confirmed by the fact that\r\nBracton, whose treatise was written a few years later, refers only to\r\nthe wager of battle as a legal procedure, and, when alluding to other\r\nforms, speaks of them as things of the past. About the same time,\r\nAlexander II. of Scotland forbade its use in cases of theft.[1353]\r\nNearly contemporary was the Neapolitan Code, promulgated in 1231, by\r\nauthority of the Emperor Frederic II., in which he not only prohibits\r\nthe use of the ordeal in all cases, but ridicules, in a very curious\r\npassage, the folly of those who could place confidence in it.[1354]\r\nWe may conclude, however, that this was not effectual in eradicating\r\nit, for, fifty years later, Charles of Anjou found it necessary to\r\nrepeat the injunction.[1355] About the same time, Waldemar II. of\r\nDenmark, Hako Hakonsen of Iceland and Norway; and soon afterwards\r\nBirger Jarl of Sweden, followed the example.[1356] In Frisia we learn\r\nthat the inhabitants still refused to obey the papal mandates, and\r\ninsisted on retaining the red-hot iron, a contumacy which Emo, the\r\ncontemporary Abbot of Wittewerum, cites as one of the causes of the\r\nterrible inundation of 1219;[1357] though a century later the Laws\r\nof Upstallesboom show that ordeals of all kinds had fallen into\r\ndesuetude.[1358] In France, we find no formal abrogation promulgated;\r\nbut the contempt into which the system had fallen is abundantly proved\r\nby the fact that in the ordinances and books of practice issued\r\nduring the latter half of the century, such as the _Établissements_\r\nof St. Louis, the _Conseil_ of Pierre de Fontaines, the _Coutumes du\r\nBeauvoisis_ of Beaumanoir, and the _Livres de Jostice et de Plet_,\r\nits existence is not recognized even by a prohibitory allusion, the\r\njudicial duel thenceforward monopolizing the province of irregular\r\nevidence. Indeed, a Latin version of the Coutumier of Normandy, dating\r\nabout the middle of the thirteenth century, or a little earlier, speaks\r\nof it as a mode of proof formerly employed in cases where one of the\r\nparties was a woman who could find no champion to undergo the wager of\r\nbattle, adding that it had been forbidden by the Church, and that such\r\ncases were then determined by inquests.[1359]\r\n\r\nGermany was more tardy in yielding to the mandates of the Church. The\r\nTeutonic knights who wielded their proselyting swords in the Marches of\r\nPrussia introduced the ordeal among other Christian observances, and in\r\n1222 Honorius III., at the prayer of the Livonian converts, promulgated\r\na decree by which he strictly interdicted its use for the future.[1360]\r\nEven in 1279 we find the Council of Buda, and in 1298 that of Wurzburg,\r\nobliged to repeat the prohibition uttered by that of Lateran.[1361]\r\nThese commands enjoyed little respect, and the independent spirit of\r\nthe Empire still refused obedience to the commands of the Church. It\r\nmay probably be to Germany that Roger Bacon refers, about this time,\r\nwhen he speaks of the ordeals of red-hot iron and cold water being\r\nstill in use by authority of the Church, and admits that the exorcisms\r\nemployed in them by the priests may have virtue in the detection of\r\nguilt and acquittal of innocence.[1362] Even in the fourteenth century\r\nthe ancestral customs were preserved in full vigor as regular modes of\r\nprocedure in a manual of legal practice still extant. An accusation\r\nof homicide could be disproved only by the judicial combat, while in\r\nother felonies a man of bad repute had no other means of escape than by\r\nundergoing the trial by hot water or iron.[1363]\r\n\r\nIn Aragon, Don Jayme I. included the ordeal in his prohibition of the\r\nduel when framing laws for his Minorcan conquest in 1230, and that\r\nthis was his settled policy is seen by a similar clause of the fuero\r\nof Huesca in 1247.[1364] In Castile and Leon, the charter of Medina de\r\nPomar, granted in 1219 by Fernando III., provides that there shall be\r\nno trial by the hot-water ordeal,[1365] and that of Treviño in 1254, by\r\nAlfonso X., forbids all ordeals.[1366] Still the Council of Palencia,\r\nin 1322, was obliged to threaten with excommunication all concerned in\r\nadministering the ordeal of fire or of water,[1367] which proves how\r\nlittle had been accomplished by the enlightened code of the “Partidas,”\r\nissued about 1260 by Alfonso the Wise. In this the burden of proof is\r\nexpressly thrown upon the complainant, and no negative evidence is\r\ndemanded of the defendant, who is specially exempted from the necessity\r\nof producing it;[1368] and although in obedience to the chivalrous\r\nspirit of the age, the battle ordeal is not abolished, yet it is so\r\nlimited as to be practically a dead letter, while no other form of\r\nnegative proof is even alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, even in the middle of the fifteenth century St. Antonino of\r\nFlorence considers it necessary, in his instructions to confessors, to\r\ntell them that a judge who prescribes the combat or the red-hot iron\r\ncommits mortal sin;[1369] and Angelo da Chiavasco, who died in 1485,\r\nrequires confessors to inquire of penitents whether they have ordered\r\nor accepted the hot-iron ordeal.[1370] Even as late as 1599 G. Ferretti\r\ntells us that in some districts of Naples, inhabited by Epirotes,\r\nhusbands who suspect their wives of adultery force them to prove their\r\ninnocence by the ordeal of red-hot iron or boiling water.[1371]\r\n\r\nAlthough the ordeal was thus removed from the admitted jurisprudence\r\nof Europe, the principles of faith which had given it vitality were\r\ntoo deeply implanted in the popular mind to be at once eradicated,\r\nand accordingly, as we have seen above, instances of its employment\r\ncontinued occasionally for several centuries to disgrace the tribunals.\r\nThe ordeal of battle, indeed, as shown in the preceding essay, was\r\nnot legally abrogated until long afterward; and the longevity of\r\nthe popular belief, upon which the whole system was founded, may be\r\ngathered from a remark of Sir William Staundford, a learned judge and\r\nrespectable legal authority, who, in 1557, expresses the same confident\r\nexpectation of Divine interference which had animated Hincmar or\r\nPoppo. After stating that in an accusation of felony, unsupported by\r\nevidence, the defendant had a right to wager his battle, he proceeds:\r\n“Because in that the appellant demands judgment of death against the\r\nappellee, it is more reasonable that he should hazard his life with the\r\ndefendant for the trial of it, than to put it on the country ... and to\r\nleave it to God, to whom all things are open, to give the verdict in\r\nsuch case, _scilicet_, by attributing the victory or vanquishment to\r\nthe one party or the other, as it pleaseth Him.”[1372] Nearly about the\r\nsame time, Ciruelo, who for thirty years was Inquisitor at Saragossa,\r\nalludes to cases in which he had personally known of its employment,\r\nthus showing that it was in popular use, even though not prescribed by\r\nthe law, in Spain during the middle of the sixteenth century.[1373] In\r\nGermany not long before the learned Aventinus showed plainly that the\r\nexisting incredulity which treated all such reliance on God as insanity\r\nwas much less to his taste than the pious trust which through ages\r\nof faith had led princes and prelates to place their hope in God and\r\ninvoke him with all the solemnities of religion to decide where human\r\nwisdom was at fault.[1374]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the prohibitions uttered by the papacy had undoubtedly much to\r\ndo in influencing monarchs to abolish the ordeal, there were other\r\ncauses of scarcely less weight working to the same end. The revival\r\nof the Roman law in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the\r\nintroduction of torture as an unfailing expedient in doubtful cases did\r\nmuch to influence the secular tribunals against all ordeals. So, also,\r\na powerful assistant must be recognized in the rise of the communes,\r\nwhose sturdy common sense not infrequently rejected its absurdity.\r\nThese influences, however, have been discussed at some length in the\r\nprevious essay, and it is scarce worth while to repeat what has there\r\nbeen said, except to add that, as a recognized legal procedure, the\r\nordeal succumbed with a less prolonged struggle than the single combat.\r\n\r\nYet no definite period can be assigned to the disappearance in any\r\ncountry of the appeals to Heaven handed down from our ancestors in\r\nthe illimitable past. We have seen above how certain forms of the\r\nordeal, such as bier-right and the trial by cold water, have lingered\r\nvirtually to our own times, though long since displaced from the\r\nstatute-book; and we should err if we deemed the prohibition of the\r\nsystem by lawgivers to be either the effect or the cause of a change in\r\nthe constitution of the human mind. The mysterious attraction of the\r\nunknown, the striving for the unattainable, the yearning to connect our\r\nmortal nature with some supernal power—all these mixed motives assist\r\nin maintaining the superstitions which we have thus passed in review.\r\nEven though the external manifestations may have been swept away, the\r\npotent agencies which vivified them have remained, not perhaps less\r\nactive because they work more secretly. One generation of follies after\r\nanother, strangely affiliated, waits on the successive descendants of\r\nman, and perpetuates in another shape the superstition which seemed\r\nto be eradicated. In its most vulgar and abhorrent form, we recognize\r\nit in the fearful epidemic of sorcery and witchcraft which afflicted\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; sublimed to the verge of\r\nheaven, we see it reappear in the seraphic theories of Quietism;\r\ndescending again towards earth, it stimulates the mad vagaries of the\r\nConvulsionnaires. In a different guise, it leads the refined scepticism\r\nof the eighteenth century to a belief in the supernatural powers of\r\nthe divining rod, which could not only trace out hidden springs and\r\ndeep-buried mines, but could also discover crime, and follow the\r\nmalefactor through all the doublings of his cunning flight.[1375] Even\r\nat the present day, as various references in the preceding pages\r\nsufficiently attest, there is a lurking undercurrent of superstition\r\nwhich occasionally rises into view and shows that we are not yet exempt\r\nfrom the weakness of the past. Each age has its own sins and follies\r\nto answer for—happiest that which best succeeds in hiding them, for\r\nit can scarce do more. Here, at the close of the nineteenth century,\r\nwhen the triumph of human intelligence over the forces of nature,\r\nstimulating the progress of material prosperity, has deluded us into\r\nsacrificing our psychical to our intellectual being—even here the\r\nduality of our nature reasserts itself, and in the crudity of Mormonism\r\nand in the fantastic mysteries of spiritism we see a protest against\r\nthe despotism of mere reason. If we wonder at these perversions of our\r\nnoblest attributes, we must remember that the intensity of the reaction\r\nmeasures the original strain, and in the insanities of the day we thus\r\nmay learn how utterly we have forgotten the Divine warning, “Man shall\r\nnot live by bread alone!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                               TORTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTORTURE IN EGYPT AND ASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding essays have traced the development of sacramental\r\npurgation and of the ordeal as resources devised by human ingenuity and\r\ncredulity when called upon to decide questions too intricate for the\r\nimpatient intellect of a rude and semi-barbarous age. There was another\r\nmode, however, of attaining the same object which has received the\r\nsanction of the wisest lawgivers during the greater part of the world’s\r\nhistory, and our survey of man’s devious wanderings in the search\r\nof truth would be incomplete without glancing at the subject of the\r\njudicial use of torture. The ordeal and torture, in fact, are virtually\r\nsubstitutes for each other. It will be seen that they have rarely\r\ncoexisted, and that, as a general rule, the legislation which depended\r\non the one rejected the other.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of society, the judge or the pleader whose faith\r\ndoes not lead him to rely upon an appeal to God naturally seeks to\r\nextort from the reluctant witness a statement of what he might desire\r\nto conceal, or from the presumed criminal a confession of his guilt. To\r\naccomplish this, the readiest means would seem to be the infliction of\r\npain, to escape from which the witness would sacrifice his friends,\r\nand the accused would submit to the penalty of his crime. The means\r\nof administering graduated and effectual torment would thus be sought\r\nfor, and the rules for its application would in time be developed\r\ninto a regular system, forming part of the recognized principles of\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest civilization, that of Egypt, it would seem as though\r\ntorture was too opposed to the whole theory of judicial proceedings\r\nto be employed, if we are to believe the description which Diodorus\r\nSiculus gives of the solemn and mysterious tribunals, where written\r\npleadings alone were allowed, lest the judges should be swayed by the\r\neloquence of the human voice, and where the verdict was announced, in\r\nthe unbroken silence, by the presiding judge touching the successful\r\nsuitor with an image of the Goddess of Truth.[1376] Yet a papyrus\r\nrecently interpreted gives us a judicial record of a trial, in the\r\nreign of Rameses IX. of the XXth Dynasty (circa 1200 B. C.), of\r\nthe robbers of the tomb of the Pharaoh Sebakemsauf, and this shows\r\nhow the accused, after confession, were tortured for confirmation,\r\nfirst by scourging and then by squeezing the hands and feet, showing\r\nthat, sometimes at least, this mode of ascertaining the truth was\r\nemployed.[1377]\r\n\r\nAmong the Semitic races we find torture used as a regular judicial\r\nprocess by the Assyrians,[1378] though the Mosaic jurisprudence is\r\nfree from any indication that the Hebrew law-dispensers regarded it\r\nas a legitimate expedient. Earnest advocates of the torture system,\r\nin the eighteenth century, however, did not hesitate to adduce the\r\nordeal of the bitter water of jealousy as a torture which justified the\r\nemployment in modern times of the rack and strappado.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest Aryan records, so far as we can judge from the\r\nfragments remaining of the Zoroastrian law, torture had no recognized\r\nplace. Astyages was rather a Mede than a Persian, and therefore no\r\nconclusion can be drawn from his readiness to employ it when he\r\nsought to extort the truth from unwilling witnesses, as related by\r\nHerodotus;[1379] but the savage punishments which Darius boasts of\r\ninflicting upon the rival pretenders to his throne[1380] presuppose a\r\nreadiness to resort to the most violent means of intimidation, which\r\ncould scarcely fail to include torture as an extra-judicial means of\r\ninvestigation when milder methods failed.\r\n\r\nTo the other great branch of the Aryan stock which founded the Indian\r\ncivilization, torture would likewise seem to have been unknown as a\r\nlegitimate resource; at least it has left no trace of its existence\r\nin the elaborate provisions of the Hindu law as handed down to us for\r\nnearly three thousand years. In the Institutes of Manu there are very\r\nminute directions as to evidence, the testimony preferred being that of\r\nwitnesses, whose comparative credibility is very carefully discussed,\r\nand when such evidence is not attainable, the parties, as we have seen\r\nabove, are ordered to be sworn or tried by the ordeal. These principles\r\nhave been transmitted unchanged to the present day.[1381]\r\n\r\nIn China the juristic principles in force would seem to allow no place\r\nfor the use of torture (_ante_, p. 251), though doubtless it may be\r\noccasionally resorted to as an extra-judicial expedient. In Japan it\r\nstill retains its place in the criminal codes, though we may well\r\nbelieve the assertion that practically its use has been discarded in\r\nthe progress of modern enlightenment. As to its former employment,\r\nhowever, the directions are very explicit. In the milder form of\r\nscourging it might be used in all preliminary examinations. Where\r\nreasonable moral certainty existed of guilt in serious and capital\r\ncrimes, the severer inflictions, by fire, by various mechanical\r\ndevices, by deprivation of food and sleep or by exposure to venomous\r\nreptiles, could be invoked to extort confession, the accused being\r\nnotified in advance that it would be used if he persisted in asserting\r\nhis innocence, and the official ordering it being held personally\r\nresponsible for its undue or improper employment.[1382]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGREECE AND ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe absence of torture from the codes of the elder Aryan races is not\r\nto be attributed to any inherent objection to its use, but rather to\r\nthe employment of the ordeal, which in all ages formed part of their\r\njurisprudence, and served as an unfailing resort in all doubtful\r\ncases. When we turn to the Aryans who established themselves in\r\nEurope and abandoned the ancestral custom of the ordeal, we find it\r\nat once replaced by the use of torture. Thus in Greece torture was\r\nthoroughly understood and permanently established. The oligarchical and\r\naristocratic tendencies, however, which were so strongly developed in\r\nthe Hellenic commonwealths, imposed upon it a limitation characteristic\r\nof the pride and self-respect of the governing order. As a general\r\nrule, no freeman could be tortured. Even freedmen enjoyed an\r\nexemption, and it was reserved for the unfortunate class of slaves, and\r\nfor strangers who formed no part of the body politic. Yet there were\r\nexceptions, as among the Rhodians, whose laws authorized the torture of\r\nfree citizens; and in other states it was occasionally resorted to, in\r\nthe case of flagrant political offences; while the people, acting in\r\ntheir supreme and irresponsible authority, could at any time decree its\r\napplication to any one irrespective of privilege. Thus, when Hipparchus\r\nwas assassinated by Harmodius, Aristogiton was tortured to obtain a\r\nrevelation of the plot, and several similar proceedings are related by\r\nValerius Maximus as occurring among the Hellenic nations.[1383] The\r\ninhuman torments inflicted on Philotas, son of Parmenio, when accused\r\nof conspiracy against Alexander, show how little real protection\r\nexisted when the safety of a despot was in question; and illustrations\r\nof torture decreed by the people are to be seen in the proceedings\r\nrelative to the mutilation of the statues of Hermes, and in the\r\nproposition, on the trial of Phocion, to put him, the most eminent\r\ncitizen of Athens, on the rack.\r\n\r\nIn a population consisting largely of slaves, who were generally of the\r\nsame race as their masters, often men of education and intelligence and\r\nemployed in positions of confidence, legal proceedings must frequently\r\nhave turned upon their evidence, in both civil and criminal cases.\r\nTheir evidence, however, was inadmissible, except when given under\r\ntorture, and then, by a singular confusion of logic, it was estimated\r\nas the most convincing kind of testimony. Consequently, the torturing\r\nof slaves formed an important portion of the administration of Athenian\r\njustice. Either party to a suit might offer his slaves to the torturer\r\nor demand those of his opponent, and a refusal to produce them was\r\nregarded as seriously compromising. When both parties tendered their\r\nslaves, the judge decided as to which of them should be received. Even\r\nwithout bringing a suit into court, disputants could have their slaves\r\ntortured for evidence with which to effect an amicable settlement.\r\n\r\nIn formal litigation, the defeated suitor paid whatever damages\r\nhis adversary’s slaves might have undergone at the hands of the\r\nprofessional torturer, who, as an expert in such matters, was empowered\r\nto assess the amount of depreciation that they had sustained. It\r\naffords a curious commentary on the high estimation in which such\r\ntestimony was held to observe that, when a man’s slaves had testified\r\nagainst him on the rack, they were not protected from his subsequent\r\nvengeance, which might be exercised upon them without restriction.\r\n\r\nAs the laws of Greece passed away, leaving few traces on the\r\ninstitutions of other races, save on those of Rome, it will suffice to\r\nadd that the principal modes in which torture was sanctioned by them\r\nwere the wheel, the ladder or rack, the comb with sharp teeth, the low\r\nvault, in which the unfortunate patient was thrust and bent double, the\r\nburning tiles, the heavy hogskin whip, and the injection of vinegar\r\ninto the nostrils.[1384]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days of Rome, the general principles governing the\r\nadministration of torture were the same as in Greece. Under the\r\nRepublic, the free citizen was not liable to it, and the evidence of\r\nslaves was not received without it. With the progress of despotism,\r\nhowever, the safeguards which surrounded the freeman were broken down,\r\nand autocratic emperors had little scruple in sending their subjects to\r\nthe rack.\r\n\r\nEven as early as the second Triumvirate, a prætor named Q. Gallius, in\r\nsaluting Octavius, chanced to have a double tablet under his toga. To\r\nthe timid imagination of the future emperor, the angles of the tablet,\r\noutlined under the garment, presented the semblance of a sword, and\r\nhe fancied Gallius to be the instrument of a conspiracy against his\r\nlife. Dissembling his fears for the moment, he soon caused the unlucky\r\nprætor to be seized while presiding at his own tribunal, and, after\r\ntorturing him like a slave without extracting a confession, put him to\r\ndeath.[1385]\r\n\r\nThe incident was ominous of the future, when all the powers of the\r\nstate were concentrated in the august person of the emperor. He was\r\nthe representative and embodiment of the limitless sovereignty of the\r\npeople, whose irresponsible authority was transferred to him. The rules\r\nand formularies which had regulated the exercise of power, so long as\r\nit belonged to the people, were feeble barriers to the passions and\r\nfears of Cæsarism. Accordingly, a principle soon became engrafted in\r\nRoman jurisprudence that, in all cases of _crimen majestatis_, or high\r\ntreason, the free citizen could be tortured. In striking at the ruler\r\nhe had forfeited all rights, and the safety of the state, as embodied\r\nin the emperor, was to be preserved at every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe emperors were not long in discovering and exercising their power.\r\nWhen the plot of Sejanus was discovered, the historian relates that\r\nTiberius abandoned himself so entirely to the task of examining by\r\ntorture the suspected accomplices of the conspiracy, that when an old\r\nRhodian friend, who had come to visit him on a special invitation, was\r\nannounced to him, the preoccupied tyrant absently ordered him to be\r\nplaced on the rack, and on discovering the blunder had him quietly put\r\nto death, to silence all complaints. The shuddering inhabitants pointed\r\nout a spot in Capri where he indulged in these terrible pursuits,\r\nand where the miserable victims of his wrath were cast into the sea\r\nbefore his eyes, after having exhausted his ingenuity in exquisite\r\ntorments.[1386] When the master of the world took this fearful delight\r\nin human agony, it may readily be imagined that law and custom offered\r\nlittle protection to the defenceless subject, and Tiberius was not the\r\nonly one who relished these inhuman pleasures. The half-insane Caligula\r\nfound that the torture of criminals by the side of his dinner-table\r\nlent a keener zest to his revels, and even the timid and the beastly\r\nClaudius made it a point to be present on such occasions.[1387]\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulus of such hideous appetites, capricious and\r\nirresponsible cruelty was able to give a wide extension to the law of\r\ntreason. If victims were wanted to gratify the whims of the monarch or\r\nthe hate of his creatures, it was easy to find an offender or to make\r\na crime. Under Tiberius, a citizen removed the head from a statue of\r\nAugustus, intending to replace it with another. Interrogated before\r\nthe Senate, he prevaricated, and was promptly put to the torture.\r\nEncouraged by this, the most fanciful interpretation was given to\r\nviolations of the respect assumed to be due to the late emperor. To\r\nundress one’s self or to beat a slave near his image; to carry into\r\na latrine or a house of ill fame a coin or a ring impressed with\r\nhis sacred features; to criticize any act or word of his became a\r\ntreasonable offence; and finally an unlucky wight was actually put to\r\ndeath for allowing the slaves on his farm to pay him honors on the\r\nanniversary which had been sacred to Augustus.[1388]\r\n\r\nSo, when it suited the waning strength of paganism to wreak\r\nits vengeance for anticipated defeat upon the rising energy of\r\nChristianity, it was easy to include the new religion in the convenient\r\ncharge of treason, and to expose its votaries to all the horrors of\r\ningenious cruelty. If Nero desired to divert from himself the odium of\r\nthe conflagration of Rome, he could turn upon the Christians, and by\r\nwell-directed tortures obtain confessions involving the whole sect,\r\nthus giving to the populace the diversion of a persecution on a scale\r\nuntil then unknown, besides providing for himself the new sensation of\r\nthe human torches whose frightful agonies illuminated his unearthly\r\norgies.[1389] Diocletian even formally promulgated in an edict the rule\r\nthat all professors of the hated religion should be deprived of the\r\nprivileges of birth and station, and be subject to the application of\r\ntorture.[1390] The indiscriminate cruelty to which the Christians were\r\nthus exposed without defence, at the hands of those inflamed against\r\nthem by all evil passions, may, perhaps, have been exaggerated by the\r\necclesiastical historians, but that frightful excesses were perpetrated\r\nunder sanction of law cannot be doubted by any one who has traced, even\r\nin comparatively recent times and among Christian nations, the progress\r\nof political and religious persecution.[1391]\r\n\r\nThe torture of freemen accused of crimes against the state or the\r\nsacred person of the emperor thus became an admitted principle of Roman\r\nlaw. In his account of the conspiracy of Piso, under Nero, Tacitus\r\nalludes to it as a matter of course, and in describing the unexampled\r\nendurance of Epicharis, a freedwoman, who underwent the most fearful\r\ntorments without compromising those who possessed little claim upon her\r\nforbearance, the annalist indignantly compares her fortitude with the\r\ncowardice of noble Romans, who betrayed their nearest relatives and\r\ndearest friends at the mere sight of the torture chamber.[1392]\r\n\r\nUnder these limits, the freeman’s privilege of exemption was carefully\r\nguarded, at least in theory. A slave while claiming freedom, or a\r\nman claimed as a slave, could not be exposed to torture;[1393] and\r\neven if a slave, when about to be tortured, endeavored to escape by\r\nasserting his freedom, it was necessary to prove his servile condition\r\nbefore proceeding with the legal torments.[1394] In practice, however,\r\nthese privileges were continually infringed, and numerous edicts of\r\nthe emperors were directed to repressing the abuses which constantly\r\noccurred. Thus we find Diocletian forbidding the application of\r\ntorture to soldiers or their children under accusation, unless they\r\nhad been dismissed the service ignominiously.[1395] The same emperor\r\npublished anew a rescript of Marcus Aurelius declaring the exemption of\r\npatricians and of the higher imperial officers, with their legitimate\r\ndescendants to the fourth generation;[1396] and also a dictum of Ulpian\r\nasserting the same privilege in favor of decurions, or local town\r\ncouncillors, and their children.[1397] In 376, Valentinian was obliged\r\nto renew the declaration that decurions were only liable in cases of\r\n_majestas_, and in 399 Arcadius and Honorius found it necessary to\r\ndeclare explicitly that the privilege was personal and not official,\r\nand that it remained to them after laying down the decurionate.[1398]\r\nTheodosius the Great, in 385, especially directed that priests should\r\nnot be subjected to torture in giving testimony,[1399] the significance\r\nof which is shown by the fact that no slave could be admitted to holy\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this constant repetition of the law is indicated by\r\na rescript of Valentinian, in 369, which shows that freemen were\r\nnot infrequently tortured in contravention of law; but that torture\r\ncould legally be indiscriminately inflicted by any tribunal in cases\r\nof treason, and that in other accusations it could be authorized\r\nby the order of the emperor.[1400] This power was early assumed\r\nand frequently exercised. Though Claudius at the commencement of\r\nhis reign had sworn that he would never subject a freeman to the\r\nquestion, yet he allowed Messalina and Narcissus to administer torture\r\nindiscriminately, not only to free citizens, but even to knights and\r\npatricians.[1401] So Domitian tortured a man of prætorian rank on a\r\ndoubtful charge of intrigue with a vestal virgin,[1402] and various\r\nlaws were promulgated by several emperors directing the employment\r\nof torture irrespective of rank, in some classes of accusations.\r\nThus, in 217, Caracalla authorized it in cases of suspected poisoning\r\nby women.[1403] Constantine decreed that unnatural lusts should be\r\npunished by the severest torments, without regard to the station of\r\nthe offender.[1404] Constantius persecuted in like manner soothsayers,\r\nsorcerers, magicians, diviners, and augurs, who were to be tortured\r\nfor confession, and then to be put to death with every refinement of\r\nsuffering.[1405] So, Justinian, under certain circumstances, ordered\r\ntorture to be used on parties accused of adultery[1406]—a practice,\r\nhowever, which was already common in the fourth century, if we are to\r\nbelieve the story related by St. Jerome of a miracle occurring in a\r\ncase of this nature.[1407] The power thus assumed by the monarch could\r\nevidently be limited only by his discretion in its exercise.\r\n\r\nOne important safeguard, however, existed, which, if properly\r\nmaintained, must have greatly lessened the frequency of torture as\r\napplied to freemen. In bringing an accusation the accuser was obliged\r\nto inscribe himself formally, and was exposed to the _lex talionis_ in\r\ncase he failed to prove the justice of the charge.[1408] A rescript\r\nof Constantine, in 314, decrees that in cases of _majestas_, as the\r\naccused was liable to the severity of torture without limitation of\r\nrank, so the accuser and his informers were to be tortured when they\r\nwere unable to make good their accusation.[1409] This enlightened\r\nlegislation was preserved by Justinian, and must have greatly cooled\r\nthe ardor of the pack of calumniators and informers, who, from the days\r\nof Sylla, had been encouraged and petted until they held in their hands\r\nthe life of almost every citizen.\r\n\r\nIn all this it must be borne in mind that the freeman of the Roman law\r\nwas a Roman citizen, and that, prior to the extension of citizenship\r\ngenerally to the subjects of the Empire, there was an enormous class\r\ndeprived of the protection, such as it was, of the traditional\r\nexemption. Thus when, in Jerusalem, the Jews raised a tumult and\r\naccused St. Paul, without specifying his offence, the tribune forthwith\r\nordered “that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know\r\nwherefore they cried so against him;” and when St. Paul proclaimed\r\nhimself a Roman, the preparations for his torture were stopped\r\nforthwith, and he was examined by regular judicial process.[1410] The\r\nvalue of this privilege is fairly exemplified by the envying remark of\r\nthe tribune, “With a great sum obtained I this freedom.”\r\n\r\nAll these laws relate to the extortion of confessions from the accused.\r\nIn turning to the treatment of witnesses, we find that even with\r\nthem torture was not confined to the servile condition. With slaves\r\nit was not simply a consequence of slavery, but a mode of confirming\r\nand rendering admissible the testimony of those whose character was\r\nnot sufficiently known to give their evidence credibility without it.\r\nThus a legist under Constantine states that gladiators and others\r\nof similar occupation cannot be allowed to bear witness without\r\ntorture;[1411] and, in the same spirit, a novel of Justinian, in\r\n539, directs that the rod shall be used to extract the truth from\r\nunknown persons who are suspected of bearing false witness or of being\r\nsuborned.[1412]\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, readily be imagined that when the evidence of slaves\r\nwas required, it was necessarily accompanied by the application of\r\ntorture. Indeed, Augustus declared that while it is not to be expressly\r\ndesired in trifling matters, yet in weighty and capital cases the\r\ntorture of slaves is the most efficacious mode of ascertaining the\r\ntruth.[1413] When we consider the position occupied by slavery in the\r\nRoman world, the immense proportion of bondmen who carried on all\r\nmanner of mechanical and industrial occupations for the benefit of\r\ntheir owners, and who, as scribes, teachers, stewards, and in other\r\nconfidential positions, were privy to almost every transaction of their\r\nmasters, we can readily see that scarce any suit could be decided\r\nwithout involving the testimony of slaves, and thus requiring the\r\napplication of torture. It was not even, as among most modern nations,\r\nrestricted to criminal cases. Some doubt, indeed, seems at one time\r\nto have existed as to its propriety in civil actions, but Antoninus\r\nPius decided the question authoritatively in the affirmative, and this\r\nbecame a settled principle of Roman jurisprudence, even when the slaves\r\nbelonged to masters who were not party to the case at issue.[1414]\r\n\r\nThere was but one limitation to the universal liability of slaves. They\r\ncould not be tortured to extract testimony against their masters,\r\nwhether in civil or criminal cases;[1415] though, if a slave had been\r\npurchased by a litigant to get his testimony out of court, the sale\r\nwas pronounced void, the price was refunded, and the slave could then\r\nbe tortured.[1416] This limitation arose from a careful regard for the\r\nsafety of the master, and not from any feeling of humanity towards\r\nthe slave. So great a respect, indeed, was paid to the relationship\r\nbetween the master and his slave that the principle was pushed to its\r\nfullest extent. Thus even an employer, who was not the owner of a\r\nslave, was protected against the testimony of the latter.[1417] When a\r\nslave was held in common by several owners, he could not be tortured\r\nin opposition to any of them, unless one were accused of murdering his\r\npartner.[1418] A slave could not be tortured in a prosecution against\r\nthe father or mother of the owner, or even against the guardian, except\r\nin cases concerning the guardianship;[1419] though the slave of a\r\nhusband could be tortured against the wife.[1420] Even the tie which\r\nbound the freedman to his patron was sufficient to preserve the former\r\nfrom being tortured against the latter;[1421] whence we may assume\r\nthat, in other cases, manumission afforded no protection from the rack\r\nand scourge. This question, however, appears doubtful. The exemption of\r\nfreedmen would seem to be proved by the rescript which provides that\r\ninconvenient testimony should not be got rid of by manumitting slaves\r\nso as to prevent their being subjected to torture;[1422] while, on the\r\nother hand, a decision of Diocletian directs that, in cases of alleged\r\nfraudulent wills, the slaves and even the freedmen of the heir could be\r\ntortured to ascertain the truth.[1423]\r\n\r\nThis policy of the law in protecting masters from the evidence of\r\ntheir tortured slaves varied at different periods. From an expression\r\nof Tacitus, it would seem not to have been part of the original\r\njurisprudence of the Republic, but to have arisen from a special\r\ndecree of the Senate. In the early days of the Empire, while the\r\nmonarch still endeavored to veil his irresponsible power under the\r\nforms of law, and showed his reverence for ancient rights by evading\r\nthem rather than by boldly subverting them, Tiberius, in prosecuting\r\nLibo and Silanus, caused their slaves to be transferred to the public\r\nprosecutor, and was thus able to gratify his vengeance legally by\r\nextorting the required evidence.[1424] Subsequent emperors were not\r\nreduced to these subterfuges, for the principle became established that\r\nin cases of _majestas_, even as the freeman was liable to torture,\r\nso his slaves could be tortured to convict him;[1425] and as if to\r\nshow how utterly superfluous was the cunning of Tiberius, the respect\r\ntowards the master in ordinary affairs was carried to that point that\r\nno slave could be tortured against a former owner with regard to\r\nmatters which had occurred during his ownership.[1426] On the other\r\nhand, according to Ulpian, Trajan decided that when the confession of\r\na guilty slave under torture implicated his master, the evidence could\r\nbe used against the master, and this, again, was revoked by subsequent\r\nconstitutions.[1427] Indeed, it became a settled principle of law to\r\nreject all incriminations of accomplices.\r\n\r\nHaving thus broken down the protection of the citizen against the\r\nevidence of his slaves in accusations of treason, it was not difficult\r\nto extend the liability to other special crimes. Accordingly we\r\nfind that, in 197, Septimius Severus specified adultery, fraudulent\r\nassessment, and crimes against the state as cases in which the evidence\r\nof slaves against their masters was admissible.[1428] The provision\r\nrespecting adultery was repeated by Caracalla in 214, and afterwards\r\nby Maximus,[1429] and the same rule was also held to be good in cases\r\nof incest.[1430] It is probable that this increasing tendency alarmed\r\nthe citizens of Rome, and that they clamored for a restitution of\r\ntheir immunities, for, when Tacitus was elected emperor, in 275, he\r\nendeavored to propitiate public favor by proposing a law to forbid\r\nthe testimony of slaves against their masters except in cases of\r\n_majestas_.[1431] No trace of such a law, however, is found in the\r\nimperial jurisprudence, and the collections of Justinian show that the\r\nprevious regulations were in full force in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nYet it is probable that the progress of Christianity produced some\r\neffect in mitigating the severity of legal procedure and in shielding\r\nthe unfortunate slave from the cruelties to which he was exposed.\r\nUnder the Republic, while the authority of the _paterfamilias_ was\r\nstill unabridged, any one could offer his slaves to the torture when\r\nhe desired to produce their evidence. In the earlier times, this was\r\ndone by the owner himself in the presence of the family, and the\r\ntestimony thus extorted was carefully taken down to be duly produced\r\nin court; but subsequently the proceeding was conducted by public\r\nofficers—the quæstors and triumviri capitales.[1432] How great was\r\nthe change effected is seen by the declaration of Diocletian, in 286,\r\nthat masters were not permitted to bring forward their own slaves\r\nto be tortured for evidence in cases wherein they were personally\r\ninterested.[1433] This would necessarily reduce the production of\r\nslave testimony, save in accusations of _majestas_ and other excepted\r\ncrimes, to cases in which the slaves of third parties were desired as\r\nwitnesses; and even in these, the frequency of its employment must have\r\nbeen greatly reduced by the rule which bound the party calling for\r\nit to deposit in advance the price of the slave, as estimated by the\r\nowner, to remunerate the latter for his death, or for his diminished\r\nvalue if he were maimed or crippled for life.[1434] When the slave\r\nhimself was arraigned upon a false accusation and tortured, an old\r\nlaw provided that the master should receive double the loss or damage\r\nsustained;[1435] and in 383, Valentinian the Younger went so far as to\r\ndecree that those who accused slaves of capital crimes should inscribe\r\nthemselves, as in the case of freemen, and should be subjected to the\r\n_lex talionis_ if they failed to sustain the charge.[1436] This was an\r\nimmense step towards equalizing the legal condition of the bondman and\r\nhis master. It was apparently in advance of public opinion, for the law\r\nis not reproduced in the compilations of Justinian, and probably soon\r\nwas disregarded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were some general limitations imposed on the application of\r\ntorture, but they were hardly such as to prevent its abuse at the\r\nhands of cruel or unscrupulous judges. Antoninus Pius set an example,\r\nwhich modern jurists might well have imitated, when he directed that\r\nno one should be tortured after confession to implicate others;[1437]\r\nand a rescript of the same enlightened emperor fixes at fourteen\r\nthe minimum limit of age liable to torture, except in cases of\r\n_majestas_, when, as we have seen, the law spared no one, for in the\r\nimperial jurisprudence the safety of the monarch overrode all other\r\nconsiderations.[1438] Women were spared during pregnancy.[1439]\r\nModeration was enjoined upon the judges, who were to inflict only such\r\ntorture as the occasion rendered necessary, and were not to proceed\r\nfurther at the will of the accuser.[1440] No one was to be tortured\r\nwithout the inscription of a formal accuser, who rendered himself\r\nliable to the _lex talionis_, unless there were violent suspicions to\r\njustify it;[1441] and Adrian reminded his magistrates that it should\r\nbe used for the investigation of truth, and not for the infliction of\r\npunishment.[1442] Adrian further directed, in the same spirit, that\r\nthe torture of slave witnesses should only be resorted to when the\r\naccused was so nearly convicted that it alone was required to confirm\r\nhis guilt.[1443] Diocletian ordered that proceedings should never be\r\ncommenced with torture, but that it might be employed when requisite to\r\ncomplete the proof, if other evidence afforded rational belief in the\r\nguilt of the accused.[1444]\r\n\r\nWhat was the exact value set upon evidence procured by torture it\r\nwould be difficult at this day to determine. We have seen above that\r\nAugustus pronounced it the best form of proof, but other legislators\r\nand jurists thought differently. Modestinus affirms that it is only\r\nto be believed when there is no other mode of ascertaining the\r\ntruth.[1445] Adrian cautions his judges not to trust to the torture\r\nof a single slave, but to examine all cases by the light of reason\r\nand argument.[1446] According to Ulpian, the imperial constitutions\r\nprovided that it was not always to be received nor always rejected;\r\nin his own opinion it was unsafe, dangerous, and deceptive, for some\r\nmen were so resolute that they would bear the extremity of torment\r\nwithout yielding, while others were so timid that through fear they\r\nwould at once inculpate the innocent.[1447] From the manner in which\r\nCicero alternately praises and discredits it, we can safely assume that\r\nlawyers were in the habit of treating it, not on any general principle,\r\nbut according as it might affect their client in any particular case;\r\nand Quintilian remarks that it was frequently objected to on the ground\r\nthat under it one man’s constancy makes falsehood easy to him, while\r\nanother’s weakness renders falsehood necessary.[1448] That these views\r\nwere shared by the public would appear from the often quoted maxim of\r\nPublius Syrus—“Etiam innocentes cogit mentiri dolor”—and from Valerius\r\nMaximus, who devotes his chapter _De Quæstionibus_ to three cases in\r\nwhich it was erroneously either trusted or distrusted. A slave of M.\r\nAgrius was accused of the murder of Alexander, a slave of C. Fannius.\r\nAgrius tortured him, and, on his confessing the crime, handed him over\r\nto Fannius, who put him to death. Shortly afterwards, the missing\r\nslave returned home. This same Alexander was made of sterner stuff,\r\nfor when he was subsequently suspected of being privy to the murder of\r\nC. Flavius, a Roman knight, he was tortured six times and persistently\r\ndenied his guilt, though he subsequently confessed it and was duly\r\ncrucified.[1449] A somewhat similar case gave Apollonius of Tyana an\r\nopportunity of displaying his supernatural power. Meeting in Alexandria\r\ntwelve convicts on their way to execution as robbers, he pronounced\r\none of them to be innocent, and asked the executioners to reserve him\r\nto the last, and, moreover, delayed them by his conversation. After\r\neight had been beheaded, a messenger came in hot haste to announce\r\nthat Phanion, the one selected by Apollonius, was innocent, though he\r\nhad accused himself to avoid the torture.[1450] A curious instance,\r\nmoreover, of the little real weight attached to such evidence is\r\nfurnished by the case of Fulvius Flaccus, in which the whole question\r\nturned upon the evidence of his slave Philip. This man was actually\r\ntortured eight times, and refused through it all to criminate his\r\nmaster, who was nevertheless condemned.[1451] The same conclusion is\r\nto be drawn from the story told by St. Jerome of a woman of Vercelli\r\nrepeatedly tortured on an accusation of adultery, and finally condemned\r\nto death in spite of her constancy in asserting her innocence, the only\r\nevidence against her being that of her presumed accomplice, extorted\r\nunder torment.[1452] Quintus Curtius probably reflects the popular\r\nfeeling on the subject, in his pathetic narrative of the torture of\r\nPhilotas on a charge of conspiracy against Alexander. After enduring\r\nin silence the extremity of hideous torment, he promised to confess if\r\nit were stopped, and when the torturers were removed he addressed his\r\nbrother-in-law Craterus, who was conducting the investigation: “Tell me\r\nwhat you wish me to say.” Curtius adds that no one knew whether or not\r\nto believe his final confession, for torture is as apt to bring forth\r\nlies as truth.[1453]\r\n\r\nFrom the instances given by Valerius Maximus, it may be inferred that\r\nthere was no limit set upon the application of torture. The extent to\r\nwhich it might be carried appears to have rested with the discretion\r\nof the tribunals, for, with the exception of the general injunctions\r\nof moderation alluded to above, no instructions for its administration\r\nare to be found in the Roman laws which have been preserved to us,\r\nunless it be the rule that when several persons were accused as\r\naccomplices, the judges were directed to commence with the youngest and\r\nweakest.[1454]\r\n\r\nSince the time of Sigonius, much antiquarian research has been\r\ndirected to investigating the various forms of torture employed by the\r\nRomans. They illustrate no principles, however, and it is sufficient\r\nto enumerate the rack, the scourge, fire in its various forms, and\r\nhooks for tearing the flesh, as the modes generally authorized by law.\r\nThe Christian historians, in their narratives of the persecutions to\r\nwhich their religion was exposed, give us a more extended idea of\r\nthe resources of the Roman torture chamber. Thus Prudentius, in his\r\ndescription of the martyrdom of St. Vincent, alludes to a number of\r\nvarieties, among which we recognize some that became widely used in\r\nafter times, showing that little was left for modern ingenuity to\r\ninvent.[1455]\r\n\r\nI have dealt thus at length on the details of the Roman law of torture\r\nbecause, as will be seen hereafter, it was the basis of all modern\r\nlegislation on the subject, and has left its impress on the far less\r\nhumane administration of criminal justice in Europe almost to our own\r\nday. Yet at first it seemed destined to disappear with the downfall of\r\nthe Roman power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE BARBARIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn turning from the nicely poised and elaborate provisions of the\r\nImperial laws to the crude jurisprudence of the Barbarian hordes who\r\ngradually inherited the crumbling remains of the Empire of the West,\r\nwe enter into social and political conditions so different that we\r\nare naturally led to expect a corresponding contrast in every detail\r\nof legislation. For the cringing suppliant of the audience chamber,\r\nabjectly prostrating himself before a monarch who combines in his own\r\nperson every legislative and executive function, we have the freeman\r\nof the German forests, who sits in council with his chief, who frames\r\nthe laws which both are bound to respect, and who pays to that chief\r\nonly the amount of obedience which superior vigor and intellect may be\r\nable to enforce. The structure of such a society is fairly illustrated\r\nby the incident which Gregory of Tours selects to prove the kingly\r\nqualities of Clovis. During his conquest of Gaul, and before his\r\nconversion, his wild followers pillaged the churches with little\r\nceremony. A bishop, whose cathedral had suffered largely, sent to the\r\nking to request that a certain vase of unusual size and beauty might be\r\nrestored to him. Clovis could only promise that if the messenger would\r\naccompany him to Soissons, where the spoils were to be divided, and if\r\nthe vase should chance to fall to his share, it should be restored.\r\nWhen the time came for allotting the plunder, he addressed his men,\r\nrequesting as a special favor that the vase might be given to him\r\nbefore the division, but a sturdy soldier, brandishing his axe, dashed\r\nit against the coveted article, exclaiming, “Thou shalt take nothing\r\nbut what the lot assigns to thee.” For a year, Clovis dissembled his\r\nresentment at this rebuff, but at length, when opportunity offered, he\r\nwas prompt to gratify it. While reviewing and inspecting his troops,\r\nhe took occasion to reproach bitterly the uncourtly Frank with the\r\ncondition of his weapons, which he pronounced unserviceable. The\r\nbattle-axe excited his especial displeasure. He threw it angrily to the\r\nground, and as the owner stooped to pick it up, Clovis drove his own\r\ninto the soldier’s head, with the remark, “It was thus you served the\r\nvase at Soissons.”[1456]\r\n\r\nThis personal independence of the freeman is one of the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of all the primitive Teutonic institutions. Corporal\r\npunishments for him were unknown to the laws. The principal resource\r\nfor the repression of crime was by giving free scope to the vengeance\r\nof the injured party, and by providing fixed rates of composition by\r\nwhich he could be bought off. As the criminal could defend himself\r\nwith the sword against the _faida_ or feud of his adversary, or could\r\ncompound for his guilt with money, the suggestion of torturing him to\r\nextort a confession would seem an absurd violation of all his rights.\r\nCrimes were regarded solely as injuries to individuals, and the idea\r\nthat society at large was interested in their discovery, punishment,\r\nand prevention, was entirely too abstract to have any influence on the\r\nlegislation of so barbarous an age.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the codes of the Feini, the Ripuarians, the Alamanni, the\r\nAngli and Werini, the Frisians, the Saxons, and the Lombards contain no\r\nallusion to the employment of torture under any circumstances; and such\r\nfew directions for its use as occur in the laws of the Salien Franks,\r\nof the Burgundians, and of the Baioarians, do not conflict with the\r\ngeneral principle.\r\n\r\nThe personal inviolability which shielded the freeman cast no\r\nprotection over the slave. He was merely a piece of property, and\r\nif he were suspected of a crime, the readiest and speediest way to\r\nconvict him was naturally adopted. His denial could not be received\r\nas satisfactory, and the machinery of sacramental purgation or the\r\njudicial duel was not for him. If he were charged with a theft at\r\nhome, his master would undoubtedly tie him up and flog him until he\r\nconfessed, and if the offence were committed against a third party, the\r\nsame process would necessarily be adopted by the court. Barbarian logic\r\ncould arrive at no other mode of discovering and repressing crime among\r\nthe friendless and unprotected, whose position seemed to absolve them\r\nfrom all moral responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe little that we know of the institutions of the ancient Gauls\r\npresents us with an illustration of the same principle developed in a\r\nsomewhat different direction. Cæsar states that, when a man of rank\r\ndied, his relatives assembled and investigated the circumstances of his\r\ndeath. If suspicion alighted upon his wives, they were tortured like\r\nslaves, and if found guilty they were executed with all the refinements\r\nof torment.[1457]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this tendency of legislation, therefore, we find\r\nthat among the Barbarians the legal regulations for the torture of\r\nslaves are intended to protect the interests of the owner alone. When\r\na slave was accused of crime the master, indeed, could not refuse to\r\nhand him over to the torturer, unless he were willing to pay for him\r\nthe full _wer-gild_ of a freeman, and if the slave confessed under the\r\ntorture, the master had no claim for compensation arising either from\r\nthe punishment or crippling of his bondman.[1458] When, however, the\r\nslave could not be forced to confess and was acquitted, the owner had a\r\nclaim for damages, though no compensation was made to the unfortunate\r\nsufferer himself. The original law of the Burgundians, promulgated\r\nin 471, is the earliest of the Teutonic codes extant, and in that we\r\nfind that the accuser who failed to extract a confession was obliged\r\nto give to the owner another slave, or to pay his value.[1459] The\r\nBaioarian law is equally careful of the rights of ownership, but seems\r\nin addition to attach some criminality to the excess of torture by the\r\nfurther provision that, if the slave die under the torment without\r\nconfession, the prosecutor shall pay to the owner two slaves of like\r\nvalue, and if unable to do so, that he shall himself be delivered up\r\nas a slave.[1460] The Salic law, on the other hand, only guards the\r\ninterests of the owner by limiting the torture to 120 blows with a\r\nrod of the thickness of the little finger. If this does not extort a\r\nconfession, and the accuser is still unsatisfied, he can deposit with\r\nthe owner the value of the slave, and then proceed to torture him at\r\nhis own risk and pleasure.[1461]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all these regulations provide merely for\r\nextracting confessions from accused slaves, and not testimony from\r\nwitnesses. Indeed, the system of evidence adopted by all the Barbarian\r\nlaws for freemen was of so different a character, that no thought\r\nseems to have been entertained of procuring proof by the torture of\r\nwitnesses. The only allusion, indeed, to such a possibility shows how\r\nutterly repugnant it was to the Barbarian modes of thought. In some\r\nMSS. of the Salic law there occurs the incidental remark that when a\r\nslave accused is under the torture, if his confession implicates his\r\nmaster, the charge is not to be believed.[1462]\r\n\r\nSuch was the primitive legislation of the Barbarians, but though in\r\nprinciple it was long retained, in practice it was speedily disregarded\r\nby those whom irresponsible power elevated above the law. The Roman\r\npopulations of the conquered territories were universally allowed to\r\nlive under their old institutions; in fact, law everywhere was personal\r\nand not territorial, every race and tribe, however intermingled on the\r\nsame soil, being subjected to its own system of jurisprudence. The\r\nsummary process of extracting confessions and testimony which the Roman\r\npractice thus daily brought under the notice of the Barbarians could\r\nnot but be attractive to their violent and untutored passions. Their\r\npolitical system was too loose and undefined to maintain the freedom of\r\nthe Sicambrian forests in the wealthy plains of Gaul, and the monarch,\r\nwho, beyond the Rhine, had scarce been more than a military chief,\r\nspeedily became a despot, whose power over those immediately around\r\nhim was limited only by the fear of assassination, and over his more\r\ndistant subjects by the facility of revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen all thus was violence, and the law of the strongest was scarcely\r\ntempered by written codes, it is easy to imagine that the personal\r\ninviolability of the freeman speedily ceased to guarantee protection.\r\nEven amid the wild tribes which remained free from the corruptions of\r\ncivilization the idea of torturing for confession the friendless and\r\nunprotected was not unfamiliar, and in the Elder Edda we find King\r\nGeirröd using the torment of fire for eight days on Odin, who visits\r\nhim in disguise for the purpose of testing his hospitality.[1463]\r\nAmong the Gallic Franks, therefore, it need not surprise us to see\r\nirresponsible power readily grasping at such means to gratify hate\r\nor ambition. In the long and deadly struggle between Fredegonda and\r\nBrunhilda, for example, the fierce passions of the adversaries led them\r\nto employ without scruple the most cruel tortures in the endeavor to\r\nfathom each other’s plots.[1464] A single case may be worth recounting\r\nto show how completely torture had become a matter of course as the\r\nfirst resource in the investigation of doubtful questions. When\r\nLeudastes, about the year 580, desired to ruin the pious Bishop Gregory\r\nof Tours, he accused him to Chilperic I. of slandering the fair fame\r\nof Queen Fredegonda, and suggested that full proof for condemnation\r\ncould be had by torturing Plato and Gallienus, friends of the bishop.\r\nHe evidently felt that nothing further was required to substantiate\r\nthe charge, nor does Gregory himself, in narrating the affair, seem to\r\nthink that there was anything irregular in the proposition. Gallienus\r\nand Plato were seized, but from some cause were discharged unhurt. Then\r\na certain Riculfus, an accomplice of Leudastes, was reproached for\r\nhis wickedness by a man named Modestus, whereupon he accused Modestus\r\nto Fredegonda, who promptly caused the unhappy wretch to be severely\r\ntortured without extracting any information from him, and he was\r\nimprisoned until released by the miraculous aid of St. Medard. Finally,\r\nGregory cleared himself canonically of the imputation, and the tables\r\nwere turned. Leudastes sought safety in flight. Riculfus was not so\r\nfortunate. Gregory begged his life, but could not save him from being\r\ntortured for confession. For six hours the wretched man was hung up\r\nwith his hands tied behind his back, after which, stretched upon the\r\nrack, he was beaten with clubs, rods, and thongs, by as many as could\r\nget at him, until, as Gregory naïvely remarks, no piece of iron could\r\nhave borne it. At last, when nearly dead, his resolution gave way, and\r\nhe confessed the whole plot by which it had been proposed to get rid of\r\nChilperic and Fredegonda, and to place Clovis on the throne.[1465] Now,\r\nPlato, Gallienus, and Modestus were probably of Gallo-Roman origin, but\r\nRiculfus was evidently of Teutonic stock; moreover, he was a priest,\r\nand Plato an archdeacon, and the whole transaction shows that Roman law\r\nand Frankish law were of little avail against the unbridled passions of\r\nthe Merovingian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHS AND SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the Barbarian tribes, none showed themselves so amenable to the\r\ninfluences of Roman civilization as the Goths. Their comparatively\r\nsettled habits, their early conversion to Christianity, and their\r\nposition as allies of the empire long before they became its\r\nconquerors, rendered them far less savage under Alaric than were the\r\nFranks in the time of Clovis. The permanent occupation of Septimania\r\nand Catalonia by the Wisigoths, also, took place at a period when\r\nRome was not as yet utterly sunk, and when the power of her name\r\nstill possessed something of its ancient influence, which could not\r\nbut modify the institutions of the new-comers as they strove to adapt\r\ntheir primitive customs to the altered circumstances under which they\r\nfound themselves. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if their\r\nlaws reflect a condition of higher civilization than those of kindred\r\nraces, and if the Roman jurisprudence has left in them traces of the\r\nappreciation of that wonderful work of the human intellect which the\r\nGoths were sufficiently enlightened to entertain.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrogoths, allowing for the short duration of their nationality,\r\nwere even more exposed to the influences of Rome. Their leader,\r\nTheodoric, had been educated in Constantinople, and was fully as much a\r\nRoman as many of the Barbarian soldiers who had risen to high station\r\nunder the emperors, or even to the throne itself. All his efforts were\r\ndirected to harmonizing the institutions of his different subjects, and\r\nhe was too sagacious not to see the manifest superiority of the Roman\r\npolity.\r\n\r\nHis kingdom was too evanescent to consolidate and perfect its\r\ninstitutions or to accumulate any extended body of jurisprudence. What\r\nlittle exists, however, manifests a compromise between the spirit of\r\nthe Barbarian tribes of the period and that of the conquered mistress\r\nof the world. The Edict of Theodoric does not allude to the torture of\r\nfreemen, and it is probable that the free Ostrogoth could not legally\r\nbe subjected to it. With respect to slaves, its provisions seem mainly\r\nborrowed from the Roman law. No slave could be tortured against a third\r\nparty for evidence unless the informer or accuser was prepared to\r\nindemnify the owner at his own valuation of the slave. No slave could\r\nbe tortured against his master, but the purchase of a slave to render\r\nhis testimony illegal was pronounced null and void; the purchase money\r\nwas returned, and the slave was tortured. The immunity of freedmen is\r\nlikewise shown by the cancelling of any manumission conferred for the\r\npurpose of preventing torture for evidence.[1466] Theodoric, however,\r\nallowed his Roman subjects to be governed by their ancient laws, and\r\nhe apparently had no repugnance to the use of torture when it could\r\nlegally be inflicted. Thus he seems particularly anxious to ferret\r\nout and punish sorcerers, and in writing to the Prefect and Count of\r\nRome he urges them to apprehend certain suspected parties, and try\r\nthem by the regular legal process, which, as we have seen, by the\r\nedicts of Constantius and his successors, was particularly severe in\r\nenjoining torture in such cases, both as a means of investigation and\r\nof punishment.[1467]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Wisigoths founded a permanent state, and as they\r\nwere the only race whose use of torture was uninterrupted from the\r\nperiod of their settlement until modern times, and as their legislation\r\non the subject was to a great extent a model for that of other nations,\r\nit may be worth while to examine it somewhat closely.\r\n\r\nThe earliest code of the Wisigoths is supposed to have been compiled\r\nby Eurik, in the middle of the fifth century, but it was subsequently\r\nmuch modified by recensions and additions. It was remoulded by\r\nChindaswind and Recaswind about the middle of the seventh century,\r\nand it has reached us only in this latest condition, while the MSS.\r\nvary so much in assigning the authorship of the various laws that but\r\nlittle reliance can be placed upon the assumed dates of most of them.\r\nChindaswind, moreover, in issuing his revised code, prohibited for the\r\nfuture the use of the Roman law, which had previously been in force\r\namong the subject populations, under codes specially prepared for them\r\nby order of Alaric II. Thus the Wisigothic laws, as we have them, are\r\nnot laws of race, like the other Barbarian codes, but territorial laws\r\ncarefully digested for a whole nation by men conversant alike with the\r\nRoman and with their own ancestral jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not surprising to find in them the use of torture\r\nlegalized somewhat after the fashion of the imperial constitutions,\r\nand yet with some humane modifications and restrictions. Slaves were\r\nliable to torture under accusation, but the accuser had first to make\r\noath that he was actuated by neither fraud nor malice in preferring\r\nthe charge; and he was further obliged to give security that he would\r\ndeliver to the owner another slave of equal value if the accused were\r\nacquitted. If an innocent slave were crippled in the torture, the\r\naccuser was bound to give two of like value to the owner, and the\r\nsufferer received his freedom. If the accused died under the torture,\r\nthe judge who had manifested so little feeling and discretion in\r\npermitting it was also fined in a slave of like value, making three\r\nenuring to the owner, and careful measures were prescribed to insure\r\nthat a proper valuation was made. If the accuser was unable to meet\r\nthe responsibility thus incurred, he was himself forfeited as a slave.\r\nMoreover, the owner was always at liberty to save his slave from the\r\ntorture by proving his innocence otherwise if possible; and if he\r\nsucceeded, the accuser forfeited to him a slave of equal value, and\r\nwas obliged to pay all the costs of the proceedings.[1468]\r\n\r\nFreedmen were even better protected. They could only be tortured for\r\ncrimes of which the penalties exceeded a certain amount, varying with\r\nthe nature of the freedom enjoyed by the accused. If no confession were\r\nextorted, and the accused were crippled in the torture, the judge and\r\nthe accuser were both heavily fined for his benefit, and if he died,\r\nthe fines were paid to his family.[1469]\r\n\r\nThere could have been little torturing of slaves as witnesses, for in\r\ngeneral their evidence was not admissible, even under torture, against\r\nany freeman, including their masters. The slaves of the royal palace,\r\nhowever, could give testimony as though they were freemen,[1470] and,\r\nas in the Roman law, there were certain excepted crimes, such as\r\ntreason, adultery, homicide, sorcery, and coining, in accusations of\r\nwhich slaves could be tortured against their masters, nor could they be\r\npreserved by manumission against this liability.[1471]\r\n\r\nAs regards freemen, the provisions of different portions of the code\r\ndo not seem precisely in harmony, but all of them throw considerable\r\ndifficulties in the way of procedures by torture. An early law directs\r\nthat, in cases of theft or fraud, no one shall be subjected to torture\r\nunless the accuser bring forward the informer, or inscribe himself with\r\nthree sureties to undergo the _lex talionis_ in case the accused prove\r\ninnocent. Moreover, if no confession were extorted, the informer was\r\nto be produced. If the accuser could not do this, he was bound to name\r\nhim to the judge, who was then to seize him, unless he were protected\r\nby some one too powerful for the judicial authority to control. In\r\nthis event it was the duty of the judge to summon the authorities to\r\nhis aid, and in default of so doing he was liable for all the damages\r\narising from the case. The informer, when thus brought within control\r\nof the court, was, if a freeman, declared infamous, and obliged to\r\npay ninefold the value of the matter in dispute; if a slave, sixfold,\r\nand to receive a hundred lashes. If the freeman were too poor to pay\r\nthe fine, he was adjudged as a slave in common to the accuser and the\r\naccused.[1472]\r\n\r\nA later law, issued by Chindaswind, is even more careful in its very\r\ncurious provisions. No accuser could force to the torture a man higher\r\nin station or rank than himself. The only cases in which it could be\r\ninflicted on nobles were those of treason, homicide, and adultery,\r\nwhile for freemen of humbler position the crime must be rated at a\r\nfine of 500 solidi at least. In these cases, an open trial was first\r\nprescribed. If this were fruitless, the accuser who desired to push\r\nthe matter bound himself in case of failure to deliver himself up as\r\na slave to the accused, who could maltreat him at pleasure, short of\r\ntaking his life, or compound with him at his own valuation of his\r\nsufferings. The torture then might last for three days; the accuser\r\nhimself was the torturer, subject to the supervision of the judge, and\r\nmight inflict torment to any extent that his ingenuity could suggest,\r\nshort of producing permanent injury or death. If death resulted, the\r\naccuser was delivered to the relatives of the deceased to be likewise\r\nput to death; the judge who had permitted it through collusion or\r\ncorruption was exposed to the same fate, but if he could swear that\r\nhe had not been bribed by the accuser, he was allowed to escape\r\nwith a fine of 500 solidi. A very remarkable regulation, moreover,\r\nprovided against false confessions extorted by torment. The accuser\r\nwas obliged to draw up his accusation in all its details, and submit\r\nit secretly to the judge. Any confession under torture which did not\r\nagree substantially with this was set aside, and neither convicted the\r\naccused nor released the accuser from the penalties to which he was\r\nliable.[1473]\r\n\r\nUnder such a system, strictly enforced, few persons would be found\r\nhardy enough to incur the dangers of subjecting an adversary to\r\nthe rack. As with the Franks, however, so among the Wisigoths, the\r\nlaws were not powerful enough to secure their own observance. The\r\nauthority of the kings grew gradually weaker and less able to repress\r\nthe assumptions of ambitious prelates and unruly grandees, and it is\r\neasy to imagine that in the continual struggle all parties sought to\r\nmaintain and strengthen their position by an habitual disregard of law.\r\nAt the Thirteenth Council of Toledo, in 683, King Erwig, in his opening\r\naddress, alludes to the frequent abuse of torture in contravention\r\nof the law, and promises a reform. The council, in turn, deplores\r\nthe constantly recurring cases of wrong and suffering wrought “regiæ\r\nsubtilitatis astu vel profanæ potestatis instinctu,” and proceeds to\r\ndecree that in future no freeman, noble, or priest shall be tortured\r\nunless regularly accused or indicted, and properly tried in public; and\r\nthis decree duly received the royal confirmation.[1474]\r\n\r\nAs the Goths emerge again into the light of history after the\r\nSaracenic conquest, we find these ancient laws still in force among\r\nthe descendants of the refugees who had gathered around Don Pelayo.\r\nThe use of the Latin tongue gradually faded out among them, and about\r\nthe twelfth or thirteenth century the Wisigothic code was translated\r\ninto the popular language, and this Romance version, known as the\r\n_Fuero Juzgo_, long continued the source of law in the Peninsula.\r\nIn this, the provisions of the early Gothic monarchs respecting\r\ntorture are textually preserved, with two trifling exceptions, which\r\nmay reasonably be regarded as scarcely more than mere errors of\r\ncopyists.[1475] Torture was thus maintained in Spain as an unbroken\r\nancestral custom, and the earliest reference which I have met with\r\nof it in mediæval jurisprudence occurs in 1228, when Don Jayme el\r\nConquistador of Aragon forbade his representatives from commencing\r\nproceedings by its employment without special orders.[1476] When\r\nAlfonso the Wise, about the middle of the thirteenth century, attempted\r\nto revise the jurisprudence of his dominions, in the code known as\r\n_Las Siete Partidas_, which he promulgated, he only simplified and\r\nmodified the proceedings, and did not remove the practice. Although he\r\nproclaimed that the person of man is the noblest thing of earth—“La\r\npersona del home es la mas noble cosa del mundo”[1477]—he held that\r\nstripes and other torture inflicted judicially were no dishonor even\r\nto Spanish sensitiveness.[1478] Asserting that torture was frequently\r\nrequisite for the discovery of hidden crimes,[1479] he found himself\r\nconfronted by the Church, which taught, as we shall see hereafter, that\r\nconfessions extorted under torture were invalid. To this doctrine he\r\ngave his full assent,[1480] and then, to reconcile these apparently\r\nincompatible necessities, he adopted an expedient partially suggested\r\nnot long before by Frederic II., which subsequently became almost\r\nuniversal throughout Europe, whereby the prohibition of conviction on\r\nextorted confessions was eluded. After confession under torture, the\r\nprisoner was remanded to his prison. On being subsequently brought\r\nbefore the judge he was again interrogated, when, if he persisted\r\nin his confession, he was condemned. If he recanted, he was again\r\ntortured; and, if the crime was grave, the process could be repeated a\r\nthird time; but, throughout all, he could not be convicted unless he\r\nmade a free confession apart from the torture. Even after conviction,\r\nmoreover, if the judge found reason to believe that the confession\r\nwas the result of fear of the torture, or of rage at being tortured,\r\nor of insanity, the prisoner was entitled to an acquittal.[1481] The\r\nhumane interference of the Church thus resulted only in a redoublement\r\nof cruelty; and the system once introduced, speedily tended to break\r\ndown the limits imposed on it. In a little more than half a century\r\nafter the death of Alfonso, judges were in the habit of not contenting\r\nthemselves with three inflictions, but continued the torture as long\r\nas the prisoner confessed on the rack and retracted his confession\r\nsubsequently.[1482]\r\n\r\nAlfonso’s admiration of the Roman law led him to borrow much from\r\nit rather than from the Gothic code, though both are represented in\r\nthe provisions which he established. Thus, except in accusations of\r\ntreason, no one of noble blood could be tortured, nor a doctor of\r\nlaws or other learning, nor a member of the king’s council, or that\r\nof any city or town, except for official forgery, nor a pregnant\r\nwoman, nor a child under fourteen years of age.[1483] So, when several\r\naccomplices were on trial, the torturer was directed to commence with\r\nthe youngest and worst trained, as the truth might probably be more\r\nreadily extracted from him.[1484] The provision, also, that when\r\na master, or mistress, or one of their children was found dead at\r\nhome, all the household slaves were liable to torture in the search\r\nfor the murderer, bears a strong resemblance to the cruel law of the\r\nRomans, which condemned them to death in case the murderer remained\r\nundiscovered.[1485]\r\n\r\nThe regulations concerning the torture of slaves are founded, with\r\nlittle variation, on the Roman laws. Thus, the evidence of a slave\r\nwas only admissible under torture, and no slave could be tortured to\r\nprove the guilt of a present or former owner, nor could a freedman,\r\nin a case concerning his patron, subject to the usual exceptions\r\nwhich we have already seen. The excepted crimes enumerated by Alfonso\r\nare seven, viz.: adultery, embezzlement of the royal revenues by tax\r\ncollectors, high treason, murder of a husband or wife by the other,\r\nmurder of a joint owner of a slave by his partner, murder of a testator\r\nby a legatee, and coining. With the slave, as with the freeman, all\r\ntestimony under torture required subsequent confirmation.[1486]\r\n\r\nThere is one noteworthy innovation, however, in the Partidas which was\r\nsubsequently introduced widely into the torture codes of Europe, and\r\nwhich, in theory at least, greatly extended their sphere of action.\r\nThis was the liability of freemen as witnesses. When a man’s evidence\r\nwas vacillating and contradictory, so as to afford reasonable suspicion\r\nthat he was committing perjury, all criminal judges were empowered to\r\nsubject him to torture, so as to ascertain the truth, provided always\r\nthat he was of low condition, and did not belong to the excepted\r\nclasses.[1487]\r\n\r\nWith all this, there are indications that Alfonso designed rather\r\nto restrict than to extend the use of torture, and, if his general\r\ninstructions could have been enforced, there must have been little\r\noccasion for its employment under his code. In one passage he directs\r\nthat when the evidence is insufficient to prove a charge, the accused,\r\nif of good character, must be acquitted; and in another he orders its\r\napplication only when common report is adverse to a prisoner, and he is\r\nshown to be a man of bad repute.[1488] Besides, an accuser who failed\r\nto prove his charge was always liable to the _lex talionis_, unless he\r\nwere prosecuting for an offence committed on his own person, or for\r\nthe murder of a relative not more distant than a brother or sister’s\r\nchild.[1489] The judge, moreover, was strictly enjoined not to exceed\r\nthe strict rules of the law, nor to carry the torture to a point\r\nimperilling life or limb. If he deviated from these limits, or acted\r\nthrough malice or favoritism, he was liable to a similar infliction\r\non his own person, or to a penalty greater than if he were a private\r\nindividual.[1490] The liability of witnesses was further circumscribed\r\nby the fact that in cases involving corporal punishment, no one could\r\nbe forced to bear testimony who was related to either of the parties\r\nas far as the fourth degree of consanguinity, in either the direct\r\nor collateral lines, nor even when nearly connected by marriage, as\r\nin the case of fathers-in-law, step-children, etc.[1491] Orders to\r\ninflict torture, moreover, were one of the few procedures which could\r\nbe appealed from in advance.[1492] Several of these limitations became\r\ngenerally adopted through Europe. We shall see, however, that they\r\nafforded little real protection to the accused, and it is more than\r\nprobable that they received as little respect in Spain as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere were many varieties of torture in use at the period, but Alfonso\r\ninforms us that only two were commonly employed, the scourge and the\r\nstrappado, which consisted in hanging the prisoner by the arms while\r\nhis back and legs were loaded with heavy weights.[1493] The former of\r\nthese, however, seems to be the only one alluded to throughout the code.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the Partidas were too elaborate and too much in advance\r\nof the wants of the age to be immediately successful as a work of\r\nlegislation, and they were not confirmed by the Córtes until 1348. In\r\nthe Ordenamiento de Alcalà of Alfonso XI., issued in-that year, they\r\nare referred to as supplying all omissions in subsequent codes.[1494]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in his system of torture Alfonso the Wise merely\r\nregulated and put into shape the customs prevalent in his territories,\r\nfor the changes in it which occurred during the succeeding three or\r\nfour centuries are merely such as can be readily explained by the\r\nincreasing influence of the revived Roman jurisprudence, and the\r\nintroduction of the doctrines of the Inquisition with respect to\r\ncriminal procedures. In the final shape which the administration of\r\ntorture assumed in Castile, as described by Villadiego, an eminent\r\nlegist writing about the year 1600, it was only employed when the proof\r\nwas strong, and yet not sufficient for conviction. No allusion is made\r\nto the torture of witnesses, and Villadiego condemns the cruelty of\r\nsome judges who divide the torture into three days in order to render\r\nit more effective, since, after a certain prolongation of torment, the\r\nlimbs begin to lose their sensibility, which is recovered after an\r\ninterval, and on the second and third days they are more sensitive than\r\nat first. This he pronounces rather a repetition than a continuation\r\nof torture, and repetition was illegal unless rendered necessary by\r\nthe introduction of new testimony.[1495] As in the thirteenth century,\r\nnobles, doctors of law, pregnant women, and children under fourteen\r\nwere not liable, except in cases of high treason and some other\r\nheinous offences. The clergy also were now exempted, unless previously\r\ncondemned as infamous, and advocates engaged in pleading enjoyed a\r\nsimilar privilege. With the growth of the Inquisition, however, heresy\r\nhad now advanced to the dignity of a crime which extinguished all\r\nprerogatives, for it was held to be a far more serious offence to be\r\nfalse to Divine than to human majesty.[1496] The Partidas allow torture\r\nin the investigation of comparatively trivial offences, but Villadiego\r\nstates that it should be employed only in the case of serious crimes,\r\nentailing bodily punishment more severe than the torture itself,\r\nand torture was worse than the loss of the hands. Thus, when only\r\nbanishment, fines, or imprisonment were involved, it could not be\r\nused. The penalties incurred by judges for its excessive or improper\r\napplication were almost identical with those prescribed by Alfonso,\r\nand the limitation that it should not be allowed to endanger life or\r\nlimb was only to be exceeded in the case of treason, when the utmost\r\nseverity was permissible.[1497] In 1489 Ferdinand and Isabella had\r\ndirected that no criminal case should be heard by less than three\r\nalcaldes or judges sitting together, and torture could not be employed\r\nwithout a formal decision signed unanimously by all three. In 1534\r\nCharles V. called attention to the neglect of this rule, whereby the\r\naccused was deprived of the right of appeal, and he ordered that it\r\nshould be strictly observed in future—regulations which duly maintained\r\ntheir place on the statute book as long as the use of torture was\r\ncontinued.[1498]\r\n\r\nMany varieties were in use, but the most common were the strappado and\r\npouring water down the throat; but when the accused was so weak as to\r\nrender these dangerous, fire was applied to the soles of the feet;\r\nand the use of the scourge was not unusual. As in the ancient laws,\r\nthe owner of slaves was entitled to compensation when his bondmen\r\nwere unjustly tortured. If there was no justification for it, he was\r\nreimbursed in double the estimated value; if the judge exceeded the\r\nproper measure of torment, he made it good to the owner with another\r\nslave.[1499]\r\n\r\nWhatever limitations may theoretically have been assigned to the\r\napplication of torture, however, it is probable that they received\r\nlittle respect in practice. Simancas, Bishop of Badajos, who was a\r\nlittle anterior to Villadiego, speaks of it as a generally received\r\naxiom that scarcely any criminal accusation could be satisfactorily\r\ntried without torture.[1500] This is confirmed by the account recently\r\ndiscovered by Bergenroth of the secret history of the execution of Don\r\nCarlos, for, whether it be authentic or not, it shows how thoroughly\r\nthe use of torture had interpenetrated the judicial system of Spain. It\r\nstates that when Philip II. determined to try his wretched son for the\r\ncrime of encouraging the rebellious movements in the Netherlands, and\r\nthe prince denied the offence, torture was applied until he fainted,\r\nand, on recovering his senses, consented to confess in order to escape\r\nthe repetition which was about to be applied. It is hardly to be\r\nbelieved that even a Spanish imagination could invent the dark and\r\nterrible details of this dismal story; and even if it be not true, its\r\nauthor must have felt that such an incident was too probable to destroy\r\nits vraisemblance.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Castilian justice kept itself free from one of the\r\nworst abuses which, as we shall see hereafter, grew out of the use of\r\ntorture, in the secret inquisitorial process which established itself\r\nalmost everywhere. A law of Alfonso XI. issued in 1325 peremptorily\r\nordered that the accused should not be denied the right to know the\r\ncontents of the inquest made with respect to him, and that the names of\r\nthe witnesses should be communicated to him so that he could defend\r\nhimself freely and have all the means to which he was entitled of\r\nestablishing his innocence. Ferdinand and Isabella, moreover, in 1480,\r\ndecreed that all who desired counsel should be allowed the privilege,\r\nthose who were poor being furnished at the public expense, and no\r\ntorture could be inflicted before this was complied with. These laws,\r\nwhich offer so creditable a contrast to the legislation of other lands,\r\nremained in force and were embodied in the Recopilacion.[1501]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCARLOVINGIAN AND FEUDAL LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn turning to the other barbarian races which inherited the fragments\r\nof the Roman empire, we find that the introduction of torture as\r\na recognized and legal mode of investigation was long delayed.\r\nUnder the Merovingians, as we have seen, its employment, though not\r\ninfrequent, was exceptional and without warrant of law. When the slow\r\nreconstruction of society at length began, the first faint trace\r\nof torture is to be found in a provision respecting the crimes of\r\nsorcery and magic. These were looked upon with peculiar detestation,\r\nas offences against both God and man. It is no wonder then if the\r\nsafeguards which the freeman enjoyed under the ordinary modes of\r\njudicial procedure were disregarded in the cases of those who violated\r\nevery law, human and divine. The legislation of Charlemagne, indeed,\r\nwas by no means merciful in its general character. His mission was to\r\ncivilize, if possible, the savage and turbulent races composing his\r\nempire, and he was not overnice in the methods selected to accomplish\r\nthe task. Still, he did not venture, even if he desired, to prescribe\r\ntorture as a means of investigation, except in the case of suspected\r\nsorcerers, for whom, moreover, it is ordered indirectly rather than\r\nopenly.[1502] Yet, by this time, the personal inviolability of the\r\nfreeman was gone. The infliction of stripes and of hideous mutilations\r\nis frequently directed in the Capitularies, and even torture and\r\nbanishment for life are prescribed as a punishment for insulting\r\nbishops and priests in church.[1503]\r\n\r\nThis apparent inconsistency is only a repetition of what we have\r\nseen in the Persian and Indian institutions, where torture was\r\nsuperfluous in the presence of other forms of proof, and in Greece\r\nand Rome where it makes its appearance in the absence of those forms.\r\nThough there was no theoretical objection to torture as a process of\r\ninvestigation, yet there was no necessity for its employment as a means\r\nof evidence. That the idea of thus using it in matters of great moment\r\nwas not unfamiliar to the men of that age is evident when we find it\r\nofficially stated that the accomplices of Bernard, King of Italy, in\r\nhis rebellion against Louis le Débonnaire, in 817, on their capture\r\nconfessed the whole plot without being put to the torture.[1504] Such\r\ninstances, however, were purely exceptional. In ordinary matters, there\r\nwas a complete system of attack and defence which supplemented all\r\ndeficiencies of testimony in doubtful cases. Sacramental purgation,\r\nthe wager of battle, and the various forms of vulgar ordeals were not\r\nonly primæval customs suited to the feelings and modes of thought of\r\nthe race, but they were also much more in harmony with the credulous\r\nfaith inculcated by the Church, and the Church had by this time entered\r\non the career of temporal supremacy which gave it so potent a voice\r\nin fashioning the institutions of European society. For all these,\r\nthe ministrations of the ecclesiastic were requisite, and in many of\r\nthem his unseen agency might prove decisive. On the other hand, the\r\nhumane precepts which forbade the churchman from intervening in any\r\nmanner in judgments involving blood precluded his interference with the\r\ntorture chamber; and in fact, while torture was yet frequent under the\r\nMerovingians, the canons of various councils prohibited the presence\r\nof any ecclesiastic in places where it was administered.[1505] Every\r\nconsideration, therefore, would lead the Church in the ninth century to\r\nprefer the milder forms of investigation, and to use its all-powerful\r\ninfluence in maintaining the popular belief in them. The time had not\r\nyet come when, as we shall see hereafter, the Church, as the spiritual\r\nhead of feudal Christendom, would find the ordeal unnecessary and\r\ntorture the most practicable instrumentality to preserve the purity of\r\nfaith and the steadfastness of implicit obedience.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century, moreover, torture was incompatible with the forms\r\nof judicial procedure handed down as relics of the time when every\r\nfreeman bore his share in the public business of his sept. Criminal\r\nproceedings as yet were open and public. The secret inquisitions\r\nwhich afterwards became so favorite a system with lawyers did not\r\nthen exist. The _mallum_, or court, was perhaps no longer held in the\r\nopen air,[1506] nor were the freemen of the district constrained as\r\nof old to be present,[1507] but it was still free to every one. The\r\naccuser and his witnesses were confronted with the accused, and the\r\ncriminal must be present when his sentence was pronounced.[1508] The\r\npurgatorial oath was administered at the altar of the parish church;\r\nthe ordeal was a public spectacle; and the judicial duel drew thousands\r\nof witnesses as eager for the sight of blood as the Roman plebs. These\r\nwere all ancestral customs, inspiring implicit reverence, and forming\r\npart of the public life of the community. To substitute for them the\r\ngloomy dungeon through whose walls no echo of the victim’s screams\r\ncould filter, where impassible judges coldly compared the incoherent\r\nconfession wrung out by insufferable torment with the anonymous\r\naccusation or the depositions of secret witnesses, required a total\r\nchange in the constitution of society.\r\n\r\nThe change was long in coming. Feudalism arose and consolidated its\r\nforces on the ruins of the Carlovingian empire without altering the\r\nprinciples upon which the earlier procedures of criminal jurisdiction\r\nhad been based. As the local dignitaries seized upon their fiefs and\r\nmade them hereditary, so they arrogated to themselves the dispensation\r\nof justice which had formerly belonged to the central power, but their\r\ncourts were still open to all. Trials were conducted in public upon\r\nwell-known rules of local law and custom; the fullest opportunities\r\nwere given for the defence; and a denial of justice authorized the\r\nvassal to renounce the jurisdiction of his feudal lord and seek a\r\nsuperior court.[1509]\r\n\r\nStill, as under the Merovingians, torture, though unrecognized\r\nby law, was occasionally employed as an extraordinary element of\r\njudicial investigation, as well as a means of punishment to gratify\r\nthe vengeance of the irresponsible and cruel tyrants who ruled with\r\nabsolute sway over their petty lordships. A few such instances occur in\r\nthe documents and chronicles of the period, but the terms in which they\r\nare alluded to show that they were regarded as irregular.\r\n\r\nThus, it is related of Wenceslas, Duke of Bohemia, in the early part\r\nof the tenth century, that he destroyed the gibbets and fearful\r\ninstruments of torture wherewith the cruelty of his judges had been\r\nexercised, and that he never allowed them to be restored.[1510] An\r\nindividual case of torture which occurred in 1017 has chanced to be\r\npreserved to us by its ending in a miracle, and being the occasion of\r\nthe canonization of a saint. A pious pilgrim, reputed to belong to\r\nthe royal blood of Scotland, while wandering on the marches between\r\nthe Bavarians and the Moravians, was seized by the inhabitants on\r\nsuspicion of being a spy, and, to extort a confession, was exposed to\r\na succession of torments which ended in hanging him on a withered\r\ntree until he died. The falsity of the accusation and the sanctity of\r\nthe victim were manifested by the uninterrupted growth of his hair and\r\nnails and the constant flowing of blood from a wound, while the dead\r\ntree suddenly put forth leaves and flowers. Margrave Henry of Bavaria\r\nhad him reverently buried, and he was duly enrolled in the catalogue of\r\nsaints.[1511] A letter of Gerard, Bishop of Cambrai, in 1025, relating\r\nhow certain suspected heretics could not be forced by torment to\r\nconfession, shows that ecclesiastics already were prepared, in spite\r\nof the received dogmas of the Church, to have recourse to such means\r\nwhen no others could be found to protect the purity of the faith.[1512]\r\nIn the celebrated case, also, of the robbery of the church of Laon,\r\nabout the year 1100, the suspected thief, after conviction by the cold\r\nwater ordeal, was tortured by command of the bishop in order to make\r\nhim surrender the sacred vessels which he had concealed. Basting with\r\nhot lard was tried unsuccessfully; he was then hanged by the neck\r\nand let down at intervals for nearly a whole day, and when life was\r\nalmost extinct his resolution gave way and he agreed to discover the\r\nplace where the valuables were hidden.[1513] When Charles the Good of\r\nFlanders was murdered in 1127, one of the assassins fled to Terouane,\r\nwhere he was discovered and forced by scourging to disclose the names\r\nof his accomplices.[1514] About 1130 at Petersberg, in Saxony, we are\r\ntold of a shepherd tortured by his lord to extract money, and saved\r\nfrom suffering by an earnest prayer to St. Peter.[1515] When Richard I.\r\nof England was endeavoring to return through Germany from the crusade,\r\nit was by the torture of his page that the identity of the royal\r\ntraveller was discovered, and he was delivered to his enemy the Duke of\r\nAustria.[1516]\r\n\r\nThese are evidently rather sporadic and exceptional cases than\r\nindications of any systematic introduction of the practice. A more\r\nsignificant allusion, however, is found in the reproof administered,\r\nabout 1125, by Hildebert, Bishop of le Mans, to one of his priests, who\r\nhad been concerned in the torture of a suspected thief, for the purpose\r\nof extracting a confession. Hildebert argues that the infliction of\r\ntorture for confession is a matter for judicial decision and not of\r\nChurch discipline, and therefore not fit for a clerk to be engaged\r\nin.[1517] This would seem to show that it occasionally was a recognized\r\nmeans of proof in the lay tribunals of the period, though as yet not\r\nfavored by the Church. If so, no record of its introduction or evidence\r\nof its customary use has been preserved to us, though there is abundant\r\nevidence of its employment as a punishment and for the extortion of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAs a punishment legally inflicted, we find it prescribed, in 1168, by\r\nFrederic Barbarossa in cases of petty thefts,[1518] and in the next\r\ncentury by Frederic II. as a penalty for high treason.[1519] Special\r\ncases, too, may be instanced, where its infliction on a large scale\r\nshows that the minds of men were not unfamiliar with its use. Thus\r\nwhen, in 1125, the inhabitants of Erfurt were guilty of some outrages\r\non the imperial authority, and the town was besieged and captured by\r\nthe Emperor Lothair, the chronicler relates that large numbers of the\r\ncitizens were either killed, blinded, or tortured in various ways by\r\nthe vindictive conqueror,[1520] and in 1129 he treated the citizens of\r\nHalle in the same manner.[1521]\r\n\r\nEven towards the close of the thirteenth century, we find Rodolph of\r\nHapsburg interfering in favor of a prisoner whom one of his nobles was\r\nafflicting with cruel torments. The Emperor, however, does not venture\r\nto command, but merely entreats that the tortures be suspended until he\r\nshall have an interview with the aggressor.[1522]\r\n\r\nSo summary and effective a mode of forcing the weak and unprotected\r\nto ransom themselves was not likely to be overlooked in those ages\r\nof violence, and though the extra-judicial use of torture is foreign\r\nto our purpose, yet, as showing how men educated themselves in its\r\nemployment, it may be worth while to allude briefly to this aspect\r\nof the subject. Thus, Duke Swantopluck of Bohemia, in a marauding\r\nexpedition into Hungary in 1108, caused to be racked or put to death\r\nall prisoners who could not purchase escape by heavy ransoms.[1523]\r\nAt the same period, Germany is described to us by an eye-witness as\r\ncovered with feudal chieftains who lived a life of luxury by torturing\r\nthe miserable wretches that could scarce obtain bread and water for\r\ntheir own existence.[1524] In Spain, the same means were understood\r\nand employed by the savage nobles of that barbarous period.[1525]\r\nIn England, the fearful anarchy which prevailed under King Stephen\r\nencouraged a similar condition of affairs. The baronial castles which\r\nthen multiplied so rapidly became mere dens of robbers who ransacked\r\nthe country for all who had the unfortunate reputation of wealth. From\r\nthese they extracted the last penny by tortures; and the chronicler\r\nexpatiates on the multiplicity and horrid ingenuity of the torments\r\ndevised—suspension by the feet over slow fires; hanging by the thumbs;\r\nknotted ropes twisted around the head; crucet-houses, or chests filled\r\nwith sharp stones, in which the victim was crushed; sachentages, or\r\nframes with a sharp iron collar preventing the wearer from sitting,\r\nlying, or sleeping; dungeons filled with toads and adders; slow\r\nstarvation, &c. &c.[1526] Even in the more settled times of the close\r\nof the reign of Henry II. a case is recorded of a heavy fine inflicted\r\non a man for illegally capturing and torturing a woman;[1527] under\r\nRichard I. an epistle of Clement III. refers to a knight who had\r\nconfessed that he had tortured a priest and forced him to redeem\r\nhimself with a large sum of money;[1528] and in 1210 King John\r\nseized all the Jews in England and tortured them until they ransomed\r\nthemselves heavily.[1529]\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, there is no evidence of the revival of torture\r\nas a means of legal investigation. The community was satisfied with\r\nthe old barbaric forms of trial, and the Church, still true to its\r\nhumanizing instincts, lost no opportunity of placing the seal of its\r\ndisapprobation on the whole theory of extorting confessions. At an\r\nearly period, it had even been a matter of dispute whether a Christian\r\nmagistrate, after baptism, was at liberty to inflict torment and\r\npronounce sentence of death. The Synod of Rome in 384 had declared\r\nthat no Christian could exercise secular power without sin, because he\r\nwas obliged to contravene the teachings of the Church by ordering the\r\napplication of torture in judicial pleadings;[1530] and if Innocent I.,\r\nin 405, had decided that such proceedings were lawful, it was only on\r\nthe ground that the Church had no right to resist the laws or to oppose\r\nthe powers ordained of God.[1531] About the same time St. Augustin\r\nhad exposed the cruel absurdity of torture with a cogent terseness\r\nthat has rarely been excelled, and had stamped it with the infamy\r\nwhich it deserved.[1532] The great name of Gregory I. was on record in\r\nthe sixth century, denouncing as worthless a confession extorted by\r\nincarceration and hunger.[1533] When Nicholas I., who did so much to\r\nbuild up ecclesiastical power and influence, addressed, in 866, his\r\nwell-known epistle to the Bulgarians to aid and direct them in their\r\nconversion to orthodoxy, he recites that he is told that, in cases of\r\nsuspected theft, their courts endeavor to extort confession by stripes,\r\nand by pricking with a pointed iron. This he pronounces to be contrary\r\nto all law, human and divine, for confessions to be valid should be\r\nspontaneous; and he argues at some length on the uncertainty of the\r\nsystem of torture, and the injustice to which it leads, concluding with\r\na peremptory prohibition of its continuance.[1534]\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the same century, the manufacturers of the False\r\nDecretals had attributed to Alexander I. an epistle designed to\r\nprotect the Church from pillage and oppression, in which that pontiff\r\nis made to threaten with infamy and excommunication those who extort\r\nconfessions or other writings from ecclesiastics by force or fear, and\r\nto lay down the general rule that confessions must be voluntary and not\r\ncompulsory.[1535] On the authority of this, Ivo of Chartres, at the\r\ncommencement of the twelfth century, declares that men in holy orders\r\ncannot be forced to confess;[1536] and half a century later, Gratian\r\nlays down the more general as well as more explicit rule that no\r\nconfession is to be extorted by the instrumentality of torture.[1537]\r\nThis position was consistently maintained until the revival of the\r\nRoman law familiarized the minds of men with the procedures of the\r\nimperial jurisprudence, when the policy of the Church altered, and it\r\nyielded to the temptation of obtaining so useful a means of reaching\r\nand proving the otherwise impalpable crime of heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nREAPPEARANCE OF TORTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the twelfth century saw the study of the civil law\r\nprosecuted with intense ardor, and, in the beginning of the thirteenth,\r\nInnocent III. struck a fatal blow at the barbaric systems of the ordeal\r\nand sacramental compurgation by forbidding the rites of the Church\r\nto the one and altering the form of oath customary to the other. The\r\nunreasoning faith which had reposed confidence in the boiling caldron,\r\nor the burning ploughshare, or the trained champion as the special\r\nvehicle of Divine judgment, was fading before the Aristotelian logic\r\nof the schools, and dialectical skill could not but note the absurdity\r\nof acquitting a culprit because he could beg or buy two, or five, or\r\neleven men to swear to their belief in his oath or denial.\r\n\r\nYet with all these influences at work, the ancestral customs maintained\r\ntheir ground long and stubbornly. It is not until the latter half of\r\nthe thirteenth century that the first faint traces of legalized torture\r\nare to be found in France, at whose University of Paris for more than\r\na hundred years the study of the Pandects had become the absorbing\r\ntopic, and where the constantly increasing power of the crown found\r\nits most valuable instruments in the civil lawyers, and its surest\r\nweapon against feudalism in the extension of the royal jurisdiction.\r\nIn Germany, the progress was even slower. The decline of the central\r\nauthority, after the death of Frederic Barbarossa, rendered any\r\ngeneral change impossible, and made the absolutist principles of the\r\nimperial jurisprudence especially distasteful to the crowd of feudal\r\nsovereigns, whose privileges were best supported by perpetuating\r\norganized anarchy. The early codes, therefore, the Sachsenspiegel, the\r\nSchwabenspiegel, the Kayser-Recht, and the Richstich Landrecht, which\r\nembodied the judicial proceedings of the Teutonic nations from the\r\nthirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, seem to know no other mode of\r\ndeciding doubtful questions than sacramental purgation and the various\r\nforms of ordeal. During the latter portion of this period, it is true,\r\ntorture begins to appear, but it is an innovation.[1538]\r\n\r\nThe first indications of the modern use of torture show distinctly\r\nthat its origin is derived from the civil law. In the Latin Kingdoms\r\nof the East, the Teutonic races were brought into contact with the\r\nremains of the old civilization, impressive even in its decrepitude.\r\nIt was natural that, in governing the motley collection of Greeks,\r\nSyrians, and Franks, for whom they had to legislate, they should adopt\r\nsome of the institutions which they found in force amid their new\r\npossessions, and it is only surprising that torture did not form a\r\nmore prominent feature in their code. The earliest extant text of the\r\n_Assises de Jerusalem_ is not older than the thirteenth century, and\r\nthe blundering and hesitating way in which it recognizes, in a single\r\ninstance, the use of torture shows how novel was the idea of such\r\nprocedure to the feudal barons, and how little they understood the\r\nprinciples governing its application. When a murderer was caught in the\r\nact by two witnesses, he could be promptly hanged on their testimony,\r\nif they were strangers to the victim. If, however, they were relatives,\r\ntheir testimony was held suspect, and the confession of the accused\r\nwas requisite to his conviction. To obtain this, he was subjected to\r\ntorture for three days; if he confessed, he was hanged; if obdurate,\r\nhe was imprisoned for a year and a day, with the privilege of clearing\r\nhimself during that period by the ordeal of the red-hot iron. If he\r\ndeclined this, and if during his confinement no additional evidence was\r\nprocured, he was acquitted, and could not be again appealed for the\r\nmurder.[1539]\r\n\r\nThis show’s the transition state of the question. The criminal is\r\ncaught with the red hand and the evidence of guilt is complete,\r\nsave that the witnesses may be interested; confession thus becomes\r\nrequisite, yet the failure to extort it by prolonged torment does not\r\nclear the accused; the ordeal is resorted to in order to supplement\r\nthe torture, and solve the doubts which the latter could not remove;\r\nand finally, the criminal is absolved, though he dare not trust the\r\njudgment of God, and though the uncertainties in which torture had left\r\nthe case are not removed.\r\n\r\nItaly was the centre from which radiated the influences of the Roman\r\nlaw throughout Western Europe, and, as might be expected, it is to\r\nItaly that we must look for the earliest incorporation of torture in\r\nthe procedures of modern criminal jurisprudence. The Veronese laws\r\nin force in 1228 already show a mixture of proceedings suggestive,\r\nlike the Assises de Jerusalem, of the impending change. In doubtful\r\ncases, the podestà was empowered to ascertain the truth of testimony\r\nby either inquest, torture, or the duel.[1540] This shows that the\r\nemployment of torture was by this time recognized to some extent,\r\nthough as the code is a very full one and this is the only allusion\r\nto it, it evidently had not yet grown into one of the regular legal\r\nprocesses. So in the legislation of Frederic II. for his Neapolitan\r\nprovinces, promulgated in 1231, the mode in which it is prescribed\r\nshows that it was as yet but sparingly employed. As Frederic was one of\r\nthe earliest secular legislators who discountenanced and restricted the\r\nvarious forms of the ordeal, it was natural that, with his education\r\nand temperament, he should seek to replace them with the system of the\r\nRoman codes which he so much admired.\r\n\r\nWhen a secret murder or other heinous crime was committed, and the\r\nmost stringent investigation could not convict the perpetrators, if\r\nthe weight of suspicion fell on persons of humble station and little\r\nconsequence, they could be tortured for confession. If no torment could\r\nwring from them an acknowledgment of guilt, or if, as often happened\r\n(“prout accidere novimus in plerisque”), their resolution gave way\r\nunder insufferable torment and they subsequently recanted, then the\r\npunishment, in the shape of a fine, was inflicted on the district where\r\nthe crime had occurred.[1541] From this it is evident that torture was\r\nnot exactly a novelty, but that as yet it was only ventured upon with\r\nthe lowest and most unprotected class of society, and that confession\r\nduring its infliction was not regarded as sufficient for conviction,\r\nunless subsequently ratified.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the century, the statutes of many of the\r\nItalian cities show the gradual introduction of torture to replace\r\nthe barbarian processes which were not indigenous,[1542] and which\r\nthe traditional hate of the Italian States for the Tedeschi was not\r\nlikely to render popular. That by the middle of the century, indeed,\r\nthe practical applications of torture had been profoundly studied and\r\nwere thoroughly understood in all their most inhuman ramifications is\r\nsufficiently evident from the accounts which we possess of the fearful\r\ncruelties habitually practised by petty despots such as Eccelino da\r\nRomano.[1543]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the use of torture thus in time was superimposed\r\nupon the existing customs of Europe is clearly shown in the law of\r\nLubeck. The mercantile law of the Middle Ages disregarded, as we have\r\nseen, all the irregular forms of evidence, such as the ordeal, the\r\njudicial duel, &c., and it naturally was not favorable to torture. As\r\nthe chief of the Hanse-towns Lubeck, therefore, in its legislation\r\npreserved the principles of the mercantile law, but in time these came\r\nto be expounded by a race of lawyers imbued with the ideas of the\r\nimperial jurisprudence, and little was left of the primitive simplicity\r\nof the original code. Thus the latter, when treating of adultery,\r\nsimply provides that the accused must clear himself by oath, or be held\r\nguilty of the charge; but a commentary on it, written in 1664, assumes\r\nthat as the crime is a peculiarly secret one recourse must be at once\r\nhad to torture where there is colorable ground for suspicion.[1544]\r\n\r\nAbout this time we also find, in the increasing rigor and gradual\r\nsystematizing of the Inquisition, an evidence of the growing\r\ndisposition to resort to torture, and a powerful element in extending\r\nand facilitating its introduction. The Church had been actively\r\nengaged in discountenancing and extirpating the ordeal, and it now\r\nthrew the immense weight of its authority in favor of the new process\r\nof extorting confessions. When Frederic II., from 1220 to 1239,\r\npublished his three constitutions directed against heresy, cruel and\r\nunsparing as they were, they contained no indication that torture\r\nwas even contemplated as a mode of investigation. In conformity with\r\nthe provisions of the Lateran Council of 1215, parties suspected on\r\ninsufficient evidence were directed to prove their innocence by some\r\nfitting mode of purgation, and the same instructions were given by\r\nGregory IX. in 1235.[1545] In 1252, however, when Innocent IV. issued\r\nhis elaborate directions for the guidance of the Inquisition in Tuscany\r\nand Lombardy, he ordered the civil magistrates to extort from all\r\nheretics by torture not merely a confession of their own guilt, but\r\nan accusation of all who might be their accomplices; and this derives\r\nadditional significance from his reference to similar proceedings as\r\ncustomary in trials of thieves and robbers.[1546] It shows the progress\r\nmade during the quarter of the century and the high appreciation\r\nentertained by the Church for the convenience of the new system.\r\n\r\nAt first the canons of the Church, which prohibited ecclesiastics from\r\nbeing concerned in such matters, or even from being present, under pain\r\nof “irregularity,” rendered it necessary for inquisitors to call in the\r\nsecular executioners; but this interfered with promptness and secrecy,\r\nand the difficulty was removed with characteristic indirection. A\r\nseries of papal bulls from 1256 to 1266 authorized inquisitors and\r\ntheir assistants to grant mutual absolution and dispensation for\r\nirregularities,[1547] and thus they were able to take the business of\r\ninflicting torture into their own hands—an opportunity of which they\r\navailed themselves fully.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, this did not extend beyond Italy. There is extant\r\na tract, written not long after this time, containing very minute\r\ninstructions as to the established mode of dealing with the Waldensian\r\nsectaries known as the “Poor Men of Lyons.” It gives directions to\r\nbreak down their strength and overcome their fortitude by solitary\r\nconfinement, starvation, and terror, but it abstains from recommending\r\nthe infliction of absolute and direct torture, while its details are\r\nso full that the omission is fair negative evidence that such measures\r\nwere not then customary.[1548]\r\n\r\nThe whole system of the Inquisition, however, was such as to render\r\nthe resort to torture inevitable. Its proceedings were secret; the\r\nprisoner was carefully kept in ignorance of the exact charges against\r\nhim, and of the evidence upon which they were based. He was presumed\r\nto be guilty, and his judges bent all their energies to force him to\r\nconfess. To accomplish this, no means were too base or too cruel.\r\nAccording to the tract just quoted, pretended sympathizers were to be\r\nlet into his dungeon, whose affected friendship might entrap him into\r\nan unwary admission; officials armed with fictitious evidence were\r\ndirected to frighten him with assertions of the testimony obtained\r\nagainst him from supposititious witnesses; and no resources of fraud or\r\nguile were to be spared in overcoming the caution and resolution of the\r\npoor wretch whose mind, as we have seen, had been carefully weakened\r\nby solitude, suffering, hunger, and terror. From this to the rack and\r\nestrapade the step was easily taken, and was not long delayed. In\r\n1301, we find even Philippe le Bel protesting against the cruelty of\r\nFulk, the Dominican Inquisitor, and interfering to protect his subjects\r\nfrom the refinements of torture to which, on simple suspicion of\r\nheresy, unfortunate victims were habitually exposed.[1549] Yet when,\r\na few years later, the same monarch resolved upon the destruction of\r\nthe Templars, he made the Inquisition the facile instrument to which\r\nhe resorted, as a matter of course, to extort from De Molay and his\r\nknights, with endless repetition of torments, the confessions from\r\nwhich he hoped to recruit his exhausted treasury with their broad lands\r\nand accumulated riches.[1550]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Inquisition, however, is too large a subject to\r\nbe treated here in detail, and it can only be alluded to for the\r\npurpose of indicating its influence upon secular law. That influence\r\nwas immense. The legists who were endeavoring to eradicate the feudal\r\ncustoms could not expect the community to share their admiration of\r\nthe Roman law, and naturally grasped with eagerness the advantage\r\noffered them in adducing the example of ecclesiastical institutions.\r\nIn founding their new system they could thus hardly avoid copying that\r\nwhich presented itself under all the authority of an infallible Church,\r\nand which had been found to work so successfully in unveiling the\r\nmost secret of hidden crimes, those of faith and belief.[1551] When,\r\ntherefore, men were taught that in these cases the ordinary forms and\r\nsafeguards of the law were not to stand in the way of the public good,\r\na principle was enunciated capable of illimitable development.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when Innocent IV. was prescribing torture in Italy,\r\nwe find the first evidence of its authoritative use in France as an\r\nordinary legal procedure. In December, 1254, an assembly of the nobles\r\nof the realm at Paris adopted an ordonnance regulating many points\r\nin the administration of justice. Among these occurs an order that\r\npersons of good reputation, even though poor, shall not be put to the\r\ntorture on the evidence of one witness, lest, on the one hand, they\r\nmay be forced to convict themselves falsely, or, on the other, to buy\r\nthemselves off from the infliction.[1552]\r\n\r\nThis would seem to indicate that the system of judicial torture was so\r\ncompletely established that its evils and abuses had begun to render\r\nthemselves apparent and to require restrictive legislation. Yet the\r\ncontemporaneous remains of jurisprudence show no trace of the custom,\r\nand some of them are of a nature to render their silence a negative\r\nproof of no little weight. To this period, for instance, belongs the\r\nearliest extant coutumier of Normandy, published by Ludewig, and it\r\ncontains no allusion to torture. The same may be said of the _For\r\nde Béarn_, granted in 1288, and recently printed by MM. Mazure and\r\nHatoulet, which is very full in its details of judicial procedure. The\r\ncollection of the laws of St. Louis, known as the _Établissements_,\r\nis likewise free from any instructions or directions as to its\r\napplication, though it could scarcely have been omitted had it formed\r\npart of the admitted jurisprudence of the age. It may be argued,\r\nindeed, that these codes and laws assume the existence of torture, and\r\ntherefore make no reference to it, but such an argument would not hold\r\ngood with respect to the books of practice which shrewd and experienced\r\nlawyers commenced at that time to draw up for the guidance of courts\r\nin the unsettled period of conflict between the ancient feudal customs\r\nand the invading civil law. For instance, no text-book can well be more\r\nminute than the _Livres de Jostice et de Plet_, written about the year\r\n1260, by a lawyer of the school of Orleans, then celebrated as the\r\nheadquarters of the study of the imperial jurisprudence. He manifests\r\nupon almost every page his familiar acquaintance with the civil and\r\ncanon law, and he could not possibly have avoided some reference to\r\ntorture if it had been even an occasional resource in the tribunals in\r\nwhich he pleaded, and yet he does not in any way allude to it.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion is derivable from the _Coutumes du Beauvoisis_,\r\nwritten about 1270 by Philippe de Beaumanoir. In his position as royal\r\nbailli, Beaumanoir had obtained the fullest possible familiarity with\r\nall the practical secular jurisprudence of his day, and his tendencies\r\nwere naturally in favor of the new system with which St. Louis was\r\nendeavoring to break down the feudal customs. Yet, while he details\r\nat much length every step in all the cases, civil and criminal, that\r\ncould be brought into Court, he makes no allusion to torture as a\r\nmeans of obtaining evidence. In one passage, it is true, he seems\r\nto indicate that a prisoner could be forced, while in prison, to\r\ncriminate himself, but the terms employed prove clearly that this\r\nwas not intended to include the administration of torment.[1553] In\r\nanother place, moreover, when treating of robberies, he directs that\r\nall suspected parties should be long and closely confined, but that,\r\nif they cannot be convicted by external evidence, they must at last be\r\ndischarged.[1554] All this is clearly incompatible with the theory of\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nThe _Conseil_ of Pierre de Fontaines, which was probably written\r\nabout the year 1260, affords the same negative evidence in its full\r\ninstructions for all the legal proceedings then in use. In these three\r\nworks, notwithstanding the reforms attempted by St. Louis, the legist\r\nseems to imagine no other solution than the wager of battle for the\r\nsettlement of doubtful cases, wherein testimony is insufficient. The\r\nform of trial is still public, in the feudal or royal courts, and\r\nevery opportunity is given both for the attack and the defence. The\r\nwork of de Fontaines, moreover, happens to furnish another proof that\r\nhe wrote at the commencement of a transition period, during which\r\nthe use of torture was introduced. In the oldest MSS. of his work,\r\nwhich are considered to date from 1260 to 1280, there is a passage to\r\nthe effect that a man convicted of crime may appeal, if he has not\r\nconfessed, or, when he has confessed, if it has been in consequence\r\nof some understanding (_covent_). In later MSS., transcribed in the\r\nearly part of the fourteenth century, the word “covent” is replaced\r\nby “tourmenz,”[1555] thus showing not only the introduction of torture\r\nduring the interval, but also that a conviction obtained by it was not\r\nfinal.\r\n\r\nThe Ordonnance of 1254, indeed, as far as it relates to torture,\r\nis asserted by modern criticism to have been applicable only to\r\nLanguedoc.[1556] If so, its importance is reduced to a minimum, for\r\nin the document as registered in the council of Béziers in 1255, the\r\nsection respecting torture is omitted,[1557] and this would seem to\r\nshow that even in the south, where the traditions of the Roman law\r\nwere continuous, torture was still regarded as an innovation not to\r\nbe legally sanctioned. Still it was gradually winning its way against\r\npopular repugnance, for we have in 1260 a charter from Alphonse de\r\nPoitiers to the town of Auzon (Auvergne), in which he grants exemption\r\nfrom torture in all trials irrespective of the gravity of the\r\ncrime.[1558]\r\n\r\nWhile giving due weight, however, to all this, we must not lose\r\nsight of the fact that the laws and regulations prescribed in royal\r\nordonnances and legal text-books were practically applicable only to\r\na portion of the population. All non-nobles, who had not succeeded in\r\nextorting special privileges by charter from their feudal superiors,\r\nwere exposed to the caprices of barbarous and irresponsible power.\r\nIt was a maxim of feudal law that God alone could intervene between\r\nthe lord and his villein—“Mès par notre usage n’a-il, entre toi et\r\nton vilein, juge fors Deu”[1559]—the villein being by no means\r\nnecessarily a serf; and another rule prohibited absolutely the villein\r\nfrom appealing from the judgment of his lord.[1560] Outside of law,\r\nand unauthorized by coutumiers and ordonnances, there must, under such\r\ninstitutions, have been habitually vast numbers of cases in which the\r\nimpatient temper of the lord would seek a solution of doubtful matters,\r\nin the potent cogency of the rack or scourge, rather than waste\r\ntime or dignity in endeavoring to cross-question the truth out of a\r\nquick-witted criminal.\r\n\r\nStill, as an admitted legal procedure, the introduction of torture was\r\nvery gradual. The _Olim_, or register of cases decided by the Parlement\r\nof Paris, extends, with some intervals, from 1255 to 1318, and the\r\npaucity of affairs recorded in which torture was used shows that it\r\ncould not have been habitually resorted to during this period. The\r\nfirst instance, indeed, only occurs in 1283, when the Bishop of Amiens\r\ncomplains of the bailli of that town for having tried and tortured\r\nthree clerks in defiance of the benefit of clergy which entitled them\r\nto exemption from secular jurisdiction. The bailli pleaded ignorance\r\nof their ecclesiastical character, and his plea was admitted as\r\nsufficient.[1561] The next instance of the use of torture is found in\r\n1299, when the royal bailli of Senlis cites the mayor and jurats of\r\nthat town before the Parlement, because in a case of theft they had\r\napplied the question to a suspected criminal; and although theft was\r\nwithin their competence, the bailli argued that torture was an incident\r\nof “haute justice” which the town did not possess. The decision was in\r\nfavor of the municipality.[1562] The next year (1300) we find a clerk,\r\nwearing habit and tonsure, complaining that the royal officials of\r\nthe town of Villeneuve in Rouergue had tortured him in divers ways,\r\nwith ropes and heavy weights, heated eggs and fire, so that he was\r\ncrippled, and had been forced to expend three hundred livres Tournois\r\nin medicines and physicians. This, with other proper damages, he prays\r\nmay be made good to him by the perpetrators, and the arrêt of the\r\nParlement orders their persons and property to be seized, and their\r\npossessions valued, in order that the amount may be properly assessed\r\namong them.[1563] Philippe le Bel, notwithstanding his mortal quarrel\r\nwith the papacy—or perhaps in consequence of it—was ever careful of\r\nthe rights and privileges of the clergy, among which the immunity from\r\nsecular jurisdiction and consequently from torture was prominent. The\r\ncase evidently turned upon that point.\r\n\r\nThe fourth case does not present itself until 1306. Two Jews, under\r\naccusation of larceny by their brethren, complain that they had been\r\nillegally tortured by the bailli of Bourges, and though one of them\r\nunder the infliction had confessed to complicity, the confession is\r\nretracted and damages of three thousand livres Tournois are demanded.\r\nOn the other hand, the bailli maintains that his proceedings are\r\nlegal, and asks to have the complainants punished in accordance with\r\nthe confession. The Parlement adopts a middle course; it acquits the\r\nJews and awards no damages, showing that the torture was legal and a\r\nretracted confession valueless.[1564]\r\n\r\nThe fifth case, which occurs in 1307, is interesting as having for its\r\nreporter no less a personage than Guillaume de Nogaret, the captor of\r\nBoniface VIII. A certain Guillot de Ferrières, on a charge of robbery,\r\nhad been tried by the judge of Villelongue and Nicolas Bourges, royal\r\nchatelain of Mont-Ogier. The latter had tortured him repeatedly and\r\ncruelly, so that he was permanently crippled, and his uncle, Étienne\r\nde Ferrières, Chatelain of Montauban, claims damages. The decision\r\ncondemns Nicolas Bourges in a mulct of one thousand livres Tournois,\r\nhalf to Guillot for his sufferings and half to Étienne for his\r\nexpenses, besides a fine to the crown.[1565] It is evident that judges\r\nwere not allowed to inflict unlimited torment at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe sixth case, occurring in 1310, may be passed over, as the torture\r\nwas not judicial, but merely a brutal outrage by a knight on a noble\r\ndamsel who resisted his importunities: though it may be mentioned that\r\nof the fine inflicted on him, fifteen hundred livres Tournois enured to\r\nthe crown and only one hundred to the victim.[1566]\r\n\r\nThe seventh case took place in 1312, when Michael de Poolay, accused of\r\nstealing a sum of money from Nicolas Loquetier, of Rouen, was subjected\r\nto a long imprisonment and torture at Château-Neuf de Lincourt, and\r\nwas then brought to the Châtelet at Paris, where he was again examined\r\nwithout confession or conviction. Meanwhile, the real criminal\r\nconfessed the theft, and Nicolas applies to the Parlement for the\r\nliberation of Michael, which is duly granted.[1567]\r\n\r\nA long interval then occurs, and we do not hear of torture again until\r\n1318, when Guillaume Nivard, a money-changer of Paris, was accused of\r\ncoining, and was tortured by the Prevôt of the Châtelet. He contends\r\nthat it was illegal, while the Prevôt asserts that his jurisdiction\r\nempowered him to administer it. The Parlement investigates the case,\r\nand acquits the prisoner, but awards him no damages.[1568]\r\n\r\nThe essentially common-place and trivial character of these cases has\r\nits interest in showing that the practice of appealing to the Parlement\r\nwas not confined to weighty matters, and therefore that the few\r\ninstances in which torture was involved in such appeals afford a fair\r\nindex of the rarity of its use during this period. These cases, too,\r\nhave seemed to me worth reciting, as they illustrate the principles\r\nupon which its application was based in the new jurisprudence, and\r\nthe tentative and uncertain character of the progress by which the\r\nprimitive customs of the European races were gradually becoming\r\nsupplanted by the resuscitated Roman law.\r\n\r\nA few instances, moreover, are on record in which torture was used in\r\naffairs of state. Thus in 1304 we find Charles of Valois torturing a\r\nFlemish beguine who was accused of an attempt to poison him. The mode\r\nadopted was the application of fire to the soles of the victim’s feet,\r\nand though she was said to have confessed, still he liberated her after\r\na short imprisonment.[1569] In the frightful scandal, also, of the\r\ndaughters-in-law of Philippe le Bel, which occurred in 1314, though\r\ntorture does not seem to have been used in examining the principals,\r\neither the princesses or their paramours, it was freely employed upon\r\nthe numerous persons who were accused as accessories.[1570] In 1315,\r\nduring the long trial of Enguerrand de Marigny, sacrificed after the\r\ndeath of Philippe le Bel to the hatred of Charles of Valois, torture\r\nwas freely used to obtain evidence from his dependents;[1571] and in\r\nthe same year Raoul de Presles, accused of the death of the late king,\r\nwas exposed to torture without obtaining a confession, and was finally\r\nliberated.[1572]\r\n\r\nThis undermining of the ancient customs had not been allowed to\r\ncontinue uninterrupted by protest and resistance. In the closing days\r\nof the reign of Philippe le Bel the feudal powers of France awoke to\r\nthe danger with which they were menaced by the extension of the royal\r\nprerogative during the preceding half-century. A league was formed\r\nwhich seemed to threaten the existence of the institutions so carefully\r\nnurtured by St. Louis and his successors. It was too late, however, and\r\nthough the storm broke on the new and untried royalty of Louis Hutin,\r\nthe crown lawyers were already too powerful for the united seigneurie\r\nof the kingdom. When the various provinces presented their complaints\r\nand their demands for the restoration of the old order of things, they\r\nwere met with a little skilful evasion, a few artful promises, some\r\nconcessions which were readily withdrawn, and negatives carefully\r\ncouched in language which seemed to imply assent.\r\n\r\nAmong the complaints we find the introduction of torture enumerated\r\nas an innovation upon the established rights of the subject, but the\r\nlawyers who drew up the replies of the king took care to infringe as\r\nlittle as they could upon a system which their legal training led\r\nthem to regard as an immense improvement in procedure, especially as\r\nit enabled them to supersede the wager of battle, which they justly\r\nregarded as the most significant emblem of feudal independence.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the nobles resulted in obtaining from the king a series\r\nof charters for the several provinces, by which he defined, as vaguely,\r\nindeed, as he could, the extent of royal jurisdiction claimed, and in\r\nwhich he promised to relieve them from certain grievances. In some of\r\nthese charters, as in those granted to Britanny, to Burgundy, and to\r\nAmiens and Vermandois, there is no allusion made to torture.[1573]\r\nIn the two latter, the right to the wager of battle is conceded,\r\nwhich may explain why the nobles of those provinces were careless to\r\nprotect themselves from a process which they could so easily avoid by\r\nan appeal to the sword. In the charter of Languedoc, all that Louis\r\nwould consent to grant was a special exemption to those who had enjoyed\r\nthe dignity of capitoul, consul, or decurion of Toulouse and to their\r\nchildren, and even this trifling concession did not hold good in cases\r\nof _lèse-majesté_ or other matters particularly provided for by law;\r\nthe whole clause, indeed, is borrowed from the Roman law, which may\r\nhave reconciled Louis’s legal advisers to it, more especially as, for\r\nthe first time in French jurisprudence, it recognized the crime of\r\n_lèse-majesté_, which marked the triumph of the civil over the feudal\r\nlaw.[1574] Normandy only obtained a vague promise that no freeman\r\nshould be subjected to torture unless he were the object of violent\r\npresumptions in a capital offence, and that the torture should be so\r\nregulated as not to imperil life or limb; and though the Normans were\r\ndissatisfied with this charter, and succeeded in getting a second one\r\nsome months later, they gained nothing on this point.[1575]\r\n\r\nThe official documents concerning Champagne have been preserved to\r\nus more in detail. The nobles of that province complained that the\r\nroyal prevôts and serjeants entered upon their lands to arrest their\r\nmen and private persons, whom they then tortured in defiance of their\r\ncustoms and privileges (“contre leurs coustumes et libertez”). To this\r\nLouis promised to put an end. The nobles further alleged that, in\r\ncontravention of the ancient usages and customs of Champagne (“contre\r\nles us et coustumes enciens de Champagne”), the royal officers presumed\r\nto torture nobles on suspicion of crime, even though not caught in the\r\nact, and without confession. To this Louis vaguely replied that for the\r\nfuture no nobles should be tortured, except under such presumptions\r\nas might render it proper, in law and reason, to prevent crime from\r\nremaining unpunished; and that no one should be convicted unless\r\nconfession was persevered in for a sufficient time after torture.[1576]\r\nThis, of course, was anything but satisfactory, and the Champenois were\r\nnot disposed to accept it; but all that they could obtain after another\r\nremonstrance was a simple repetition of the promise that no nobles\r\nshould be tortured except under capital accusations.[1577] The struggle\r\napparently continued, for, in 1319, we find Philippe le Long, in a\r\ncharter granted to Périgord and Quercy, promising that the proceedings\r\npreliminary to torture should be had in the presence of both parties,\r\ndoubtless to silence complaints as to the secret character which\r\ncriminal investigations were assuming.[1578]\r\n\r\nThe use of torture was thus permanently established in the judicial\r\nmachinery of France as one of the incidents in the great revolution\r\nwhich destroyed the feudal power. Even yet, however, it was not\r\nuniversal, especially where communes had the ability to preserve their\r\nfranchises. Count Beugnot has published, as an appendix to the _Olim_,\r\na collection known as the _Tout Lieu de St. Disier_, consisting of\r\n314 decisions of doubtful cases referred by the magistrates of St.\r\nDizier to the city of Ypres for solution, as they were bound to do by\r\ntheir charter. This especially directed that all cases not therein\r\nprovided for should be decided according to the customs of Ypres, and\r\nconsequently, for two hundred and fifty years, whenever the eschevins\r\nof the little town in Champagne felt in doubt they referred the matter\r\nto the lordly burghers of Flanders as to a court of last resort. In\r\nthe _Tout Lieu_ the cases date mostly from the middle third of the\r\nfourteenth century, and were selected as a series of established\r\nprecedents. The fact that, throughout the whole series, torture is not\r\nalluded to in a single instance shows that it was a form of procedure\r\nunknown to the court of the eschevins of St. Dizier, and even to the\r\nsuperior jurisdiction of the bailli of their suzerain, the Seigneur\r\nof Dampierre. Many of these cases seem peculiarly adapted to the new\r\ninquisitorial system. Thus, in 1335, a man was attacked and wounded in\r\nthe street at night. A crowd collected at his cries, and he named the\r\nassailant. No rule was more firmly established than the necessity of\r\ntwo impartial witnesses to justify condemnation, and the authorities\r\nof St. Dizier, not knowing what course to take, applied as usual for\r\ninstructions to the magistrates of Ypres. The latter defined the law\r\nto be that the court should visit the wounded man on his sick-bed and\r\nadjure him by his salvation to tell the truth. If on this he named any\r\none and subsequently died, the accused should be pronounced guilty; if,\r\non the other hand, he recovered, then the accused should be treated\r\naccording to his reputation: that is, if of good fame, he should be\r\nacquitted; if of evil repute, he should be banished.[1579] No case more\r\ninviting under the theory of torture could well be imagined, and yet\r\nneither the honest burghers of St. Dizier nor the powerful magnates of\r\nYpres seem to have entertained the idea of its application. So, again,\r\nwhen the former inquire what proof is sufficient when a man accuses\r\nanother of stealing, the answer is that no evidence will convict,\r\nunless the goods alleged to be stolen are found in the possession of\r\nthe accused.[1580] The wealthy city of Lille equally rejected the\r\nprocess of torture. The laws in force there, about the year 1350,\r\nprescribe that in cases of homicide conviction ought to be based upon\r\nabsolute evidence, but where this is unattainable then the judges are\r\nallowed to decide on mere opinion and belief, for uncertain matters\r\ncannot be rendered certain.[1581] In such a scheme of legislation, the\r\nextortion of a confession as a condition precedent to condemnation can\r\nevidently find no place.\r\n\r\nAttempts to introduce torture in Aquitaine were apparently made,\r\nbut they seem to have been resisted. In the Coutumier of Bordeaux,\r\nduring the fourteenth century there is a significant declaration that\r\nthe sages of old did not wish to deprive men of their liberties and\r\nprivileges. Torture, therefore, was prohibited in the case of all\r\ncitizens except those of evil repute and declared to be infamous.\r\nThe nearest approach to it that was permitted was tying the hands\r\nbehind the back, without using pulleys to lift the accused from the\r\nground.[1582]\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, places where torture was not used were\r\nexceptional. An allusion to it in 1335 in the register of the court\r\nof the Priory of St. Martin-des-Champs shows that already it was not\r\nconfined to the royal jurisdiction, but that it was recognized as an\r\nincident to the possession of haute justice.[1583] By a document of\r\n1359, it appears that it was the custom to torture all malefactors\r\nbrought to the Châtelet of Paris,[1584] and though privileged persons\r\nconstantly endeavored to exempt themselves from it, as the consuls of\r\nVilleneuve in 1371,[1585] and the Seigneur d’Argenton in 1385,[1586]\r\nother privileged persons as constantly sought to obtain the power of\r\ninflicting it, as shown in the charter of Milhaud, granted in 1369,\r\nwherein the consuls of that town are honored with the special grace\r\nthat no torture shall be administered except in their presence, if they\r\ndesire to attend.[1587] At the end of the century, indeed, the right to\r\nadminister torture in cases wherein the accused denied the charge was\r\nregularly established among the privileges of haute justiciers.[1588]\r\n\r\nBy this time criminal procedures were fully recognized as\r\ndivisible into two classes—the _procès ordinaire_ and the _procès\r\nextraordinaire_. The former of these was carried on by the form of\r\ninquest, the latter by inquisition, in which torture was habitually\r\nemployed. There were no definite rules to determine the class to which\r\nany given case might be referred, and though at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century the _procès ordinaire_, as its name infers, was the\r\nusual mode of trying criminals, gradually the choice between the two\r\nwas left to the discretion of the judge, and this discretion leaned so\r\nconstantly in favor of the _procès extraordinaire_ that by the close of\r\nthe century it had become the rule rather than the exception.[1589]\r\n\r\nThis is very clearly shown by the records of the Châtelet of Paris\r\nfrom 1389 to 1392,[1590] which enable us to form a tolerably distinct\r\nidea of the part assigned to torture in the criminal procedure of this\r\nperiod. It had virtually become the main reliance of the tribunal, for\r\nthe cases in which it was not employed appear to be simply exceptional.\r\nNoble blood afforded no exemption, for gentlemen were placed on the\r\nrack for petty crimes as freely as roturiers.[1591] No avenue of escape\r\nwas open to the miserable culprit. If he denied the alleged offence,\r\nhe was tortured at once for a confession, and no settled rules seem\r\nto have existed as to the amount of evidence requisite to justify it.\r\nThus, in one case, a man on the _tresteau_ relating the misdeeds of\r\nhis evil life chanced to mention the name of another as a professional\r\nthief. The latter was immediately arrested, and though there was\r\nno specific crime charged against him, he was tortured repeatedly\r\nuntil sufficient confession was extracted from him to justify his\r\nexecution.[1592] If, on the other hand, the prisoner persistently\r\ndenied his guilt there was no limit to the repetition of the torture,\r\nand yet, even when no confession could be thus extracted, the failure\r\ndid not always serve to exempt him from punishment.[1593] If he\r\nretracted the confession extorted from him, he was tortured again and\r\nagain until he ceased to assert his innocence, for it was a positive\r\nnecessity for conviction that the confession under torture should be\r\nconfirmed by the prisoner without constraint—“sans aucune force, paour\r\nou contrainte de gehayne”—when sentence came to be passed upon him\r\noutside of the torture-chamber.\r\n\r\nIf, again, the luckless prisoner confessed the crime of which he stood\r\naccused, he was further promptly tortured to find out what other\r\noffences he might at some previous time have committed. This, which we\r\nwill see hereafter, continued to be to the end one of the worst abuses\r\nof the torture system, was already a practice at least half a century\r\nold,[1594] and it had become so habitual that it is scarcely worth\r\nwhile to cite particular examples, though the case of Gervaise Caussois\r\nmay be briefly referred to on account of its quaintness. Arrested for\r\nstealing some iron tools, he promptly confessed the crime. Among the\r\nreasons on record for proceeding to torture him in order to elicit an\r\naccount of his other presumed misdemeanors, is included the excellent\r\none, “attendu qu’il est scabieux.” Under the torment the poor wretch\r\naccused himself of some other petty thefts, but even this did not\r\nsatisfy his examiners, for the next day he was again brought before\r\nthem and bound to the _tresteau_, when he confessed a few more trifling\r\nlarcenies. Having apparently thus obtained enough evidence to satisfy\r\ntheir consciences, his judges mercifully hanged him without further\r\ninfliction.[1595] In fact, the whole matter apparently was left very\r\nmuch to the discretion of the court, which seems to have been bound by\r\nno troublesome limitations to its curiosity in investigating the past\r\ncareer of the miserable beings brought before it.\r\n\r\nHow that discretion was habitually exercised may be judged from the\r\ncase of a certain Fleurant de Saint-Leu, who was brought up for\r\nexamination Jan. 4, 1390, on the charge of stealing a silver buckle.\r\nDenying the accusation, he was twice tortured with increasing severity,\r\nuntil he confessed the alleged crime, but asserted it to be a first\r\noffence. On Jan. 8th the court decided that as the petty theft was\r\ninsufficient to merit death, he should be tortured repeatedly to\r\nascertain whether he had not been guilty of something else worthy of\r\ncapital punishment. On that day he was therefore thrice exposed to\r\nthe question, in an ascending scale of severity, but without success.\r\nOn the 13th he was again twice tortured, when the only admission that\r\nrewarded the examiners was that three years before he had married a\r\nprostitute at Senlis. This uncommon obduracy seems to have staggered\r\nthe court, for he was then kept in his dungeon until April 9th, when\r\nhis case was carefully considered, and though nothing had been extorted\r\nfrom him since his first confession, he was condemned, and was hanged\r\nthe same day—thus proving how purely gratuitous were the fearful\r\nsufferings to which he had been exposed in order to gratify the\r\ncuriosity or satisfy the consciences of his remorseless judges.[1596]\r\n\r\nFew criminals, however, gave so much trouble as Fleurant. The “petit et\r\ngrand tresteaux,” on which the torture was customarily administered,\r\nwere a sword which cut many a Gordian knot, and, by rendering the\r\njustice of the Châtelet sharp and speedy, saved the court a world of\r\ntrouble. It was by no means unusual for the accused to be arraigned,\r\ntortured, condemned, and executed all on the same day,[1597] and not a\r\nfew of the confessions read as though they were fictions composed by\r\nthe accused in order to escape by death from the interminable suffering\r\nto which they were exposed. The sameness frequently visible in a long\r\ncatalogue of crimes seems to indicate this, but it is especially\r\nnotable in some singular cases of parties accused of poisoning wells\r\nthroughout the north of France, when there was an evident necessity\r\nfor the authorities to satisfy the excited populace by procuring\r\nthem some victims, and the unfortunate wretches who were arrested on\r\nsuspicion were tortured until they were ready to accuse themselves of\r\nanything.[1598] In one case, indeed, the prisoner stated that he had\r\nknown a person tortured at the Châtelet with such severity that he\r\ndied in the hands of his torturers, and for himself he declared, after\r\none or two inflictions, that he would confess whatever would relieve\r\nhim from a repetition of what he had endured.[1599]\r\n\r\nYet, with all this reckless disregard of the plainest principles of\r\njustice, the torture process had not yet entirely obliterated the\r\nmemory of the old customary law. The prisoner was not, as we shall see\r\npractised hereafter, kept in ignorance of the charges against him and\r\nof the adverse testimony. The accusation was always made known to him,\r\nand when witnesses were examined, the record is careful to specify that\r\nit was done in his presence.[1600] The court deliberated in private,\r\nbut the prisoner was brought before it to receive condemnation either\r\nto torture or to death. Facilities were likewise afforded him to\r\nprocure evidence in his favor, when the swift justice of the Châtelet\r\nmight allow him leisure for such defence, for his friends were allowed\r\nto see him in prison during the intervals of his trial.[1601]\r\n\r\nThus, in the capital, the royal power, aided by the civil lawyers, was\r\nfast encroaching upon all the liberties of the subject, but in the\r\nprovinces a more stubborn resistance was maintained. It was some little\r\ntime after the period under consideration that the ancient Coutumier\r\nof Britanny was compiled, and in it we find the use of torture,\r\nthough fully established as a judicial expedient, yet subjected to\r\nmuch greater restrictions. A prisoner, accused of a capital crime and\r\ndenying the charge, was liable to torture only if positive evidence\r\nwas unattainable, and then only if he had been under accusation within\r\nthe previous five years. Moreover, if he endured its application\r\nthree times without confession, he was discharged acquitted as one in\r\nwhose favor God would work a miracle[1602]—thus showing how torture\r\nwas assimilated in the popular mind to the ordeal which it had\r\nsupplanted. Such escape indeed might well be regarded as a miracle, for\r\nthe reckless barbarity of the age had little scruple in pushing the\r\nadministration of the question to the utmost rigor. About this same\r\ntime, the Council of Reims, in 1408, drew up a series of instructions\r\nfor the bishops of the province in visiting their dioceses; and among\r\nthe abuses enumerated for investigation was whether the judges were in\r\nthe habit of torturing prisoners to death on feast days.[1603] It was\r\nnot the cruelty, but the sacrilege to which the Church took exception.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven in Germany, the citadel of feudalism, the progress of the new\r\nideas and the influence of the Roman law had spread to such an extent\r\nthat in the Golden Bull of Charles IV., in 1356, there is a provision\r\nallowing the torture of slaves to incriminate their masters in cases\r\nof sedition against any prince of the empire;[1604] and the form of\r\nexpression employed shows that this was an innovation. Liége, which\r\nat that period formed part of the empire, furnishes us with a case in\r\n1376 which shows not only that torture then was an habitual resource in\r\nprocedure, but also that it was applied as illogically there as we have\r\nseen it in Paris. The young wife of a burgher named Gilles Surlet was\r\nfound one morning strangled in bed. The husband, as though conscious\r\nof innocence, at once presented himself to the authorities asserting\r\nwith fearful oaths his ignorance of the crime. A servant girl of the\r\nhousehold was then arrested, and she, without torture, immediately\r\nconfessed that she had committed the murder; but the judges, not\r\nsatisfied with this, submitted her to the question, when she denied her\r\nguilt with the most provoking constancy. Suspicion then grew against\r\nthe husband, and he was duly tortured without extorting a confession,\r\nthough at the same time he declared that the girl was innocent; and on\r\nbeing taken back to his cell he strangled himself during the night.\r\nThe chronicler does not record what was the fate of the girl, but the\r\nbody of Gilles was treated as that of a murderer—it was dragged to the\r\nplace of execution and broken on the wheel, while the superstitious\r\ndid not fail to note that on this dreary transit it was accompanied\r\nby a black hog, which refused to be driven away until the gallows was\r\nreached.[1605]\r\n\r\nIn Corsica, at the same period, we find the use of torture fully\r\nestablished, though subject to careful restrictions. In ordinary\r\ncases, it could only be employed by authority of the governor, to\r\nwhom the judge desiring to use it transmitted all the facts of the\r\ncase; the governor then issued an order, at his pleasure, prescribing\r\nthe mode and degree to which it might be applied.[1606] In cases of\r\ntreason, however, these limitations were not observed, and the accused\r\nwas liable to its infliction as far and as often as might be found\r\nrequisite to effect a purpose.[1607]\r\n\r\nThe Italian communities seem to have still at this period preserved\r\nsome limitations on the application of torture. In Milan, in 1338,\r\nit could be only employed in capital cases where there was evidence\r\nor public repute; it could only be ordered by the lord of the city,\r\nhis vicar, the podestà, and the criminal judges, and even these were\r\nheavily fined if they used it illegally or elsewhere than in the\r\naccustomed torture-chamber; the abuse of torturing witnesses had\r\nalready been introduced, but the judge was warned that this could be\r\ndone only when the witness swore to having been personally present and\r\nthen varied in his testimony or gave false evidence. Torture, moreover,\r\ncould only be inflicted once unless new evidence supervened.[1608] In\r\nthe statutes of Mirandola, revised in 1386, it could not be employed in\r\ncases which did not involve corporal punishment or a fine of at least\r\ntwenty-five lire; nor even then unless the podestà submitted all the\r\nevidence to the accused and gave him a sufficient and definite term\r\nin which to purge himself.[1609] In Piacenza, about the same period,\r\ntorture was guarded with even more careful restrictions. There is no\r\nindication that witnesses were exposed to it. Every effort to obtain\r\ntestimony was to be exhausted, and the accused was to be afforded full\r\nopportunities for defence before he could be subjected to it, and\r\nthen there must be sufficient indications of guilt, mere rumor being\r\ninadequate to justify it. Moreover, except in cases of high treason,\r\ntheft, highway robbery, assassination, and arson, a single judge could\r\nnot order it, but the case had to be submitted to all the judges and\r\nthe podestà, who determined by a majority in secret ballot whether\r\nit should be employed. If any of these formalities were omitted, the\r\nconfession extorted was invalid, and the judge was mulcted in a fine of\r\na hundred lire.[1610]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character of Venetian civilization made torture almost a\r\nnecessity. The atmosphere of suspicion and secrecy which surrounded\r\nevery movement of that republican despotism, the mystery in which it\r\ndelighted to shroud itself, and the pitiless nature of its legislation\r\nconspired to render torture an indispensable resource. How freely it\r\nwas administered, especially in political affairs, is well illustrated\r\nin the statutes of the State Inquisition, where the merest suspicion\r\nis sufficient to authorize its application. Thus, if a senatorial\r\nsecretary were observed to be more lavish in his expenditures than his\r\nsalary would appear to justify, he was at once suspected of being in\r\nthe pay of some foreign minister, and spies were ordered on his track.\r\nIf he were then simply found to be absent from his house at undue\r\nhours, he was immediately to be seized and put to the torture. So, if\r\nany one of the innumerable secret spies employed by the inquisitors\r\nwere insulted by being called a spy, the offender was arrested\r\nand tortured to ascertain how he had guessed the character of the\r\nemissary.[1611] Human life and human suffering were of little account\r\nin the eyes of the cold and subtle spirits who moulded the policy of\r\nthe mistress of the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nThe rude mountaineers of the Valtelline preserved to a later date\r\ntheir respect for the ancient guarantees of the law. In their statutes\r\nas revised in 1548 torture is indeed permitted, but only in case\r\nof persons accused of crimes involving the penalty of blood. In\r\naccusations of less heinous offences and in matters concerning money,\r\nit was strictly forbidden; and even in cases where it was allowed it\r\ncould not be employed without the assent of the central authority of\r\nthe territory. When proceedings were had by inquisition, moreover, all\r\nthe evidence was submitted to the accused, and a sufficient delay was\r\naccorded to him in which to frame a defence before he could be ordered\r\nto the torture. Thus were avoided the worst abuses to which the system\r\nhad been made subservient long before that time in all the surrounding\r\nregions.[1612]\r\n\r\nOther races adopted the new system with almost equal hesitation. Thus\r\nin Hungary the first formal embodiment of torture in the law occurs in\r\n1514, and though the terms employed show that it had been previously\r\nused to some extent, yet the restrictions laid down manifest an extreme\r\njealousy of its abuse. Mere suspicion was not sufficient. To justify\r\nits application, a degree of proof was requisite which was almost\r\ncompetent for condemnation, and the nature of this evidence is well\r\nexemplified in the direction that if a judge himself witnessed a\r\nmurder, he could not order the homicide to be tortured unless there was\r\nother testimony sufficient, for he could not be both witness and judge,\r\nand his knowledge of the crime belonged to his private and not to his\r\njudicial capacity.[1613] With such refinements, there would seem to be\r\nlittle danger of the extension of the custom.\r\n\r\nIn Poland, torture does not make its appearance until the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and then it was introduced gradually, with strict\r\ninstructions to the tribunals to use the most careful discretion in\r\nits administration.[1614] Until, at least, the seventeenth century,\r\nthere remained in force laws of Casimir the Great promulgated in\r\nthe fourteenth, prohibiting any prosecution not brought by a proper\r\naccuser, in whose presence alone could the matter be heard, thus\r\nshowing that the inquisitorial process found no foothold in the Polish\r\ncourts.[1615] In Russia, the first formal allusion to it is to be found\r\nin the Ulagenié Zakonof, a code promulgated in 1497, by Ivan III.,\r\nwhich merely orders that persons accused of robbery, if of evil repute,\r\nmay be tortured to supply deficiencies of evidence; but as the duel\r\nwas still freely allowed to the accused, the use of torture must have\r\nbeen merely incidental.[1616] From another source, dating about 1530,\r\nwe learn that it was customary to extort confessions from witches by\r\npouring upon them from a height a small stream of cold water; and in\r\ncases of contumacious and stubborn criminals, the finger-nails were\r\nwrenched off with little wooden wedges.[1617] Still, torture makes but\r\nlittle show in the subsequent codes, such as the Sudebtnick, issued in\r\n1550, and the Sobornoié Ulagenié, promulgated in 1648.[1618] In fact,\r\nthese regions were still too barbarous for so civilized a process.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these national jurisdictions there was a wide field\r\nopen to the use of torture in the spiritual courts established\r\neverywhere, for it was not confined to the secular tribunals and to\r\nthe Inquisition. The latter had so fully familiarized the minds\r\nof churchmen with it that it came to be employed generally in the\r\nepiscopal tribunals which, through their exclusive jurisdiction over\r\nclerks and over all matters that could be connected with spiritual\r\noffences, had considerable criminal business. We may assume, however,\r\nthat in this respect they were limited by the laws of the land and were\r\ndebarred from its use in countries where it was not allowed in secular\r\nmatters. In 1310 it required the most urgent pressure from Clement V.\r\nto induce Edward II. to violate the common law by permitting the papal\r\nemissaries to torture the English Templars, and the King sought to\r\nconceal the illegality of the act by an order to the gaolers which bore\r\nthat the inquisitors and episcopal ordinaries should be allowed to deal\r\nwith the bodies of the prisoners “in accordance with ecclesiastical\r\nlaw,”[1619] showing how completely in the minds of men torture was\r\nidentified with the spiritual courts. When the canons of the council\r\nof Vienne were promulgated in 1317 and the inquisitor Bernard Gui\r\nremonstrated with John XXII. against a clause intended to diminish the\r\nabuse of torture by inquisitors, he argued that it was a reflection on\r\nthe Inquisition, because the episcopal courts were subject to no such\r\nrestrictions on its use.[1620] The Church carried this blessing with\r\nit wherever it went. When in 1593 St. Toribio, Archbishop of Lima,\r\nsought to reform the abuses of the episcopal courts throughout his\r\nvast province, he issued an _arancel_ or tariff of fees for all their\r\nofficials. In this we find that the executioner was not to charge more\r\nthan a peso for torturing a prisoner, while the notary was entitled to\r\ntwo reales for drawing up a sentence of torture, and one real for each\r\nfolio of his record of its administration and the confession of the\r\naccused.[1621]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE INQUISITORIAL PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this period, while Central and Western Europe had advanced with\r\nsuch rapid strides of enlightenment, the inquisitorial process, based\r\nupon torture, had become the groundwork of all criminal procedure,\r\nand every detail was gradually elaborated with the most painstaking\r\nperverseness.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the influence of the Inquisition in\r\nintroducing the use of torture. Its influence did not cease there,\r\nfor with torture there gradually arose the denial to the accused\r\nof all fair opportunity of defending himself, accompanied by the\r\nsystem of secret procedure which formed so important a portion of the\r\ninquisitorial practice. In the old feudal courts, the prosecutor and\r\nthe defendant appeared in person. Each produced his witnesses; the\r\ncase was argued on both sides, and unless the wager of battle or the\r\nordeal intervened, a verdict was given in accordance with the law\r\nafter duly weighing the evidence, while both parties were at liberty\r\nto employ counsel and to appeal to the suzerain. When St. Louis\r\nendeavored to abolish the duel and to substitute a system of inquests,\r\nwhich were necessarily to some extent _ex parte_, he did not desire to\r\nwithdraw from the accused the legitimate means of defence, and in the\r\nOrdonnance of 1254 he expressly instructs his officers not to imprison\r\nthe defendant without absolute necessity, while all the proceedings\r\nof the inquest are to be communicated freely to him.[1622] All this\r\nchanged with time and the authoritative adoption of torture. The theory\r\nof the Inquisition, that the suspected man was to be hunted down\r\nand entrapped like a wild beast, that his guilt was to be assumed,\r\nand that the efforts of his judges were to be directed solely to\r\nobtaining against him sufficient evidence to warrant the extortion of a\r\nconfession without allowing him the means of defence—this theory became\r\nthe admitted basis of criminal jurisprudence. The secrecy of these\r\ninquisitorial proceedings, moreover, deprived the accused of one of the\r\ngreatest safeguards accorded to him under the Roman law of torture.\r\nThat law, as we have seen, required the formality of inscription,\r\nby which the accuser who failed to prove his charge was liable to\r\nthe _lex talionis_, and in crimes which involved torture in the\r\ninvestigation he was duly tortured. This was imitated by the Wisigoths,\r\nand its principle was admitted and enforced by the Church before the\r\nintroduction of the Inquisition had changed its policy;[1623] but\r\nmodern Europe, in borrowing from Rome the use of torture, combined it\r\nwith the inquisitorial process, and thus in civilized Christendom it\r\nspeedily came to be used more recklessly and cruelly than ever it had\r\nbeen in pagan antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn 1498, an assembly of notables at Blois drew up an elaborate\r\nordonnance for the reformation of justice in France. In this, the\r\nsecrecy of the inquisitorial process is dwelt upon with peculiar\r\ninsistence as of the first importance in all criminal cases. The\r\nwhole investigation was in the hands of the government official, who\r\nexamined every witness by himself, and secretly, the prisoner having no\r\nknowledge of what was done, and no opportunity of arranging a defence.\r\nAfter all the testimony procurable in this one-sided manner had been\r\nobtained, it was discussed by the judges, in council with other\r\npersons named for the purpose, who decided whether the accused should\r\nbe tortured. He could be tortured but once, unless fresh evidence\r\nsubsequently was collected against him, and his confession was read\r\nover to him the next day, in order that he might affirm or deny it. A\r\nsecret deliberation was then held by the same council, which decided as\r\nto his fate.[1624]\r\n\r\nThis cruel system was still further perfected by Francis I., who,\r\nin an ordonnance of 1539, expressly abolished the inconvenient\r\nprivilege assured to the accused by St. Louis, which was apparently\r\nstill occasionally claimed, and directed that in no case should he\r\nbe informed of the accusation against him, or of the facts on which\r\nit was based, nor be heard in his defence. Upon examination of the\r\n_ex parte_ testimony, without listening to the prisoner, the judges\r\nordered torture proportioned to the gravity of the accusation, and\r\nit was applied at once, unless the prisoner appealed, in which case\r\nhis appeal was forthwith to be decided by the superior court of the\r\nlocality.[1625] The whole process was apparently based upon the\r\nconviction that it was better that a hundred innocent persons should\r\nsuffer than that one culprit should escape, and it would not be easy\r\nto devise a course of procedure better fitted to render the use of\r\ntorture universal. There was some protection indeed, theoretically\r\nat least, in the provision which held the judge responsible when an\r\ninnocent prisoner was tortured without sufficient preliminary proof\r\nto justify it; but this salutary regulation, from the very nature\r\nof things, could not often be enforced, and it was so contrary to\r\nthe general spirit of the age that it soon became obsolete. Thus, in\r\nBrittany, perhaps the most independent of the French provinces, the\r\nCoutumier, as revised in 1539, retains such a provision,[1626] but it\r\ndisappears in the revision of 1580.\r\n\r\nBut even this was not all. Torture, as thus employed to convict\r\nthe accused, became known as the _question préparatoire_; and, in\r\ndefiance of the old rule that it could be applied but once, a second\r\napplication, known as the _question définitive_ or _préalable_, became\r\ncustomary, by which, after condemnation, the prisoner was again\r\nsubjected to the extremity of torment in order to discover whether he\r\nhad any accomplices, and, if so, to identify them. In this detestable\r\npractice we find another instance of the unfortunate influence of\r\nthe Inquisition in modifying the Roman law. The latter expressly and\r\nwisely provided that no one who had confessed should be examined as\r\nto the guilt of another;[1627] and in the ninth century the authors\r\nof the False Decretals had emphatically adopted the principle, which\r\nthus became embodied in ecclesiastical law,[1628] until the ardor of\r\nthe Inquisition in hunting down heretics caused it to regard the\r\nconviction of the accused as a barren triumph unless he could be forced\r\nto incriminate his possible associates. It thus finally became a rule\r\nof the Inquisition, promulgated by papal authority, that all who\r\nconfessed or were convicted should be tortured at the discretion of the\r\ninquisitor to reveal the names of their accomplices.[1629]\r\n\r\nTorture was also generically divided into the _question ordinaire_ and\r\n_extraordinaire_—a rough classification to proportion the severity of\r\nthe infliction to the gravity of the crime or the urgency of the case.\r\nThus, in the most usual kind of torment, the strappado, popularly known\r\nas the _Moine de Caen_, the ordinary form was to tie the prisoner’s\r\nhands behind his back with a piece of iron between them; a cord was\r\nthen fastened to his wrists by which, with the aid of a pulley, he was\r\nhoisted from the ground with a weight of one hundred and twenty-five\r\npounds attached to his feet. In the extraordinary torture, the weight\r\nwas increased to two hundred and fifty pounds, and when the victim was\r\nraised to a sufficient height he was dropped and arrested with a jerk\r\nthat dislocated his joints, the operation being thrice repeated.[1630]\r\n\r\nThus, in 1549, we see the system in full operation in the case of\r\nJacques de Coucy, who, in 1544, had surrendered Boulogne to the\r\nEnglish. This was deemed an act of treachery, but he was pardoned in\r\n1547; yet, notwithstanding his pardon, he was subsequently tried,\r\nconvicted, condemned to decapitation and quartering, and also to\r\nthe _question extraordinaire_ to obtain a denunciation of his\r\naccomplices.[1631]\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV., under the inspiration of Colbert, remoulded the\r\njurisprudence of France, various reforms were introduced into the\r\ncriminal law, and changes both for better and worse were made in the\r\nadministration of torture. The Ordonnance of 1670 was drawn up by a\r\ncommittee of the ablest and most enlightened jurists of the day, and\r\nit is a melancholy exhibition of human wisdom when regarded as the\r\nproduction of such men as Lamoignon, Talon, and Pussort. The cruel\r\nmockery of the _question préalable_ was retained; and in the principal\r\nproceedings all the chances were thrown against the prisoner. All\r\npreliminary testimony was still _ex parte_. The accused was heard, but\r\nhe was still examined in secret. Lamoignon vainly endeavored to obtain\r\nfor him the advantage of counsel, but Colbert obstinately refused\r\nthis concession, and the utmost privilege allowed the defence was the\r\npermission accorded to the judge, at his discretion, to confront the\r\naccused with the adverse witnesses. In the _question préliminaire_,\r\ntorture was reserved for capital cases, when the proof was strong and\r\nyet not enough for conviction. During its application it could be\r\nstopped and resumed at the pleasure of the judge, but if the accused\r\nwere once unbound and removed from the rack, it could not be repeated,\r\neven though additional evidence were subsequently obtained.[1632]\r\n\r\nIt was well to prescribe limitations, slender as these were; but in\r\npractice it was found impossible to enforce them, and they afforded\r\nlittle real protection to the accused when judges, bent upon procuring\r\nconviction, chose to evade them. A contemporary whose judicial position\r\ngave him every opportunity of knowing the truth, remarks: “They have\r\ndiscovered a jugglery of words and pretend that though it may not\r\nbe permissible to _repeat_ the torture, still they have a right to\r\n_continue_ it, though there may have been an interval of three whole\r\ndays. Then, if the sufferer, through good luck or by a miracle,\r\nsurvives this reduplication of agony, they have discovered the notable\r\nresource of _nouveaux indices survenus_, to subject him to it again\r\nwithout end. In this way they elude the intention of the law, which\r\nsets some bounds to these cruelties and requires the discharge of the\r\naccused who has endured the question without confession, or without\r\nconfirming his confession after torture.”[1633] Nor were these the\r\nonly modes by which the scanty privileges allowed the prisoner were\r\ncurtailed in practice. In 1681, a royal Declaration sets forth that, in\r\nthe jurisdiction of Grenoble, judges were in the habit of refusing to\r\nlisten to the accused, and of condemning him unheard, an abuse which\r\nwas prohibited for the future. Yet other courts subsequently assumed\r\nthat this prohibition was only applicable to the Parlement of Grenoble,\r\nand in 1703 another Declaration was necessary to enforce the rule\r\nthroughout the kingdom.[1634]\r\n\r\nThe Ordonnance of 1670, moreover, gave formal expression to another\r\nabuse which was equally brutal and illogical—the employment of torture\r\n_avec réserve des preuves_. When the judge resolved on this, the\r\nsilence of the accused under torment did not acquit him, though the\r\nwhole theory of the question lay in the necessity of confession.\r\nHe simply escaped the death penalty, and could be condemned to any\r\nother punishment which the discretion of the judge might impose, thus\r\npresenting the anomaly of a man neither guilty nor innocent, relieved\r\nfrom the punishment assigned by the law to the crime for which he had\r\nbeen arraigned, and condemned to some other penalty without having\r\nbeen convicted of any offence. This punishing for suspicion was no new\r\nthing. Before torture came fully into vogue, in the early part of the\r\nfourteenth century, a certain Estevenes li Barbiers of Abbeville was\r\nbanished under pain of death for suspicion of breach of the peace,\r\nand was subsequently tried, acquitted, and allowed to return.[1635]\r\nAbout the same period a barber of Anet and his sons were arrested by\r\nthe monks of St. Martin-des-Champs on suspicion of killing a guard\r\nwho was keeping watch over some hay. The evidence against them was\r\ninsufficient, and they were taken to the gallows as a kind of moral\r\ntorture not infrequently used in those days. Still refusing to confess,\r\nthey were banished forever under pain of hanging, because, as the\r\nrecord ingenuously states, the crime was not fully proved against\r\nthem.[1636] So in the records of the Parlement of Paris there is a\r\nsentence rendered in 1402 against Jehan Dubos, a procureur of the\r\nParlement, and Ysabelet his wife, for suspicion of the poisoning of\r\nanother procureur, Jehan le Charron, the first husband of Ysabelet,\r\nand Dubos was accordingly hanged, while his wife was burnt.[1637]\r\nJean Bodin, one of the clearest intellects of the sixteenth century,\r\nlays it down as a rule that the penalty should be proportioned to the\r\nproof; he ridicules as obsolete the principle that when the evidence\r\nis not sufficient for conviction the accused should be discharged, and\r\nmentions stripes, fines, imprisonment, the galleys, and degradation\r\nas proper substitutes for death when there is no evidence and only\r\nviolent presumption. He gives in illustration of this a case personally\r\nknown to him of a noble of Le Mans, who was condemned to nine years of\r\nthe galleys for violent suspicion of murder.[1638] The application to\r\nthe torture-process of this determination not to allow a man to escape\r\nunless his innocence was proved led to the illogical system of the\r\n_réserve des preuves_.\r\n\r\nThe theory on which the doctors of the law proceeded was that if\r\nthere were evidence sufficient for conviction and the judge yet\r\ntortured the criminal in surplusage without obtaining a confession,\r\nthe accused could not be condemned to the full punishment of his\r\noffence, because the use of torture in itself weakened the external\r\nproofs, and therefore the culprit must be sentenced to some lighter\r\npunishment—a refinement worthy of the inconsequential dialectics of\r\nthe schools.[1639] The cruel absurdities which the system produced\r\nin practice are well illustrated by a case occurring in Naples in\r\nthe sixteenth century. Marc Antonio Maresca of Sorrento was tried\r\nby the Admiralty Court for the murder of a peasant of Miani, in the\r\nmarket-place. The evidence was strong against him, but there were no\r\neye-witnesses, and he endured the torture without confession. The court\r\nasserted that it had reserved the evidence, and condemned him to the\r\ngalleys for seven years. He appealed to the High Court of the royal\r\ncouncil, and the case was referred to a distinguished jurisconsult,\r\nTomaso Grammatico, a member of the council. The latter reported that\r\nhe must be considered as innocent, after having passed through torture\r\nwithout confession, and denied the right of the court to reserve the\r\nevidence. Then, with an exhibition of the peculiar logic characteristic\r\nof the criminal jurisprudence of the time, he concluded that Maresca\r\nmight be relegated to the islands for five years, although it was a\r\nrecognized principle of Neapolitan law that torture could be inflicted\r\nonly in accusations of crimes of which the penalty was greater than\r\nrelegation. The only thing necessary to complete this tissue of legal\r\nwisdom was afforded by the council, which set aside the judgment of\r\nthe Admiralty Court, rejected the report of their colleague, and\r\ncondemned the prisoner to the galleys for three years.[1640] Somewhat\r\nless complicated in its folly, but more inexcusable from its date, was\r\nthe sentence of the court of Orléans in 1740, by which a man named\r\nBarberousse, from whom no confession had been extorted, was condemned\r\nto the galleys for life, because, as the sentence declared, he was\r\n_strongly suspected_ of premeditated murder.[1641] A more pardonable,\r\nbut not more reasonable, example occurred at Halle in 1729, where a\r\nwoman accused of infanticide refused to confess, and as she labored\r\nunder a physical defect which rendered the application of torture\r\ndangerous to life, the authorities, after due consideration and\r\nconsultation of physicians, spared her the torture and banished her\r\nwithout conviction.[1642]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same tendency to elude all restrictions on the use of torture\r\nwas manifested in the Netherlands, where the procedure was scarcely\r\nknown until the 16th century, and where it was only administered\r\nsystematically by the ordonnance on criminal justice of Philip II. in\r\n1570. When once employed it rapidly extended until it became almost\r\nuniversal, both in the provinces which threw off the yoke of Spain and\r\nin those which remained faithful. The limits which Philip had imposed\r\non it were soon transcended. He had forbidden its employment in all\r\ncases “où il n’y a plaine, demye preuve, ou bien où la preuve est\r\ncertaine et indubitable,” thus restricting it to those where there was\r\nvery strong presumption without absolute certainty. In transcription\r\nand translation, however, the wording of the ordonnance became changed\r\nto “plaine ou demye preuve, ou bien où la preuve est incertaine ou\r\ndouteuse,” thus allowing it in all cases where the judge might have a\r\ndoubt not of the guilt but of the innocence of the accused; and by the\r\ntime these errors were discovered by a zealous legal antiquarian, the\r\ncustoms of the tribunals had become so fixed that the attempt to reform\r\nthem was vain.[1643] Even the introduction of torture could not wholly\r\neradicate the notion on which the ordeal system was based, that a man\r\nunder accusation must virtually prove his innocence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Germany, torture had been reduced to a system, in 1532, by the\r\nEmperor Charles V., whose _Caroline Constitutions_ contain a more\r\ncomplete code on the subject than had previously existed, except in\r\nthe records of the Inquisition. Inconsistent and illogical, it quotes\r\nUlpian to prove the deceptive nature of the evidence thence derivable;\r\nit pronounces torture to be “res dira, corporibus hominum admodum\r\nnoxia et quandoque lethalis, cui et mors ipsa prope proponenda;”[1644]\r\nin some of its provisions it manifests extreme care and tenderness\r\nto guard against abuses, and yet practically it is merciless to the\r\nlast degree. Confession made during torture was not to be believed,\r\nnor could a conviction be based upon it; yet what the accused might\r\nconfess after being removed from torture was to be received as the\r\ndeposition of a dying man, and was full evidence.[1645] In practice,\r\nhowever, this held good only when adverse to the accused, for he was\r\nbrought before his judge after an interval of a day or two, when, if\r\nhe confirmed the confession, he was condemned, while if he retracted\r\nit he was at once thrust again upon the rack. In confession under\r\ntorture, moreover, he was to be closely cross-questioned, and if any\r\ninconsistency was observable in his self-condemnation the torture was\r\nat once to be redoubled in severity.[1646] The legislator thus makes\r\nthe victim expiate the sins of his own vicious system; the victim’s\r\nsufferings increase with the deficiency of the evidence against him,\r\nand the legislator consoles himself with the remark that the victim\r\nhas only himself to thank for it, “de se tantum non de alio quæratur.”\r\nTo complete the inconsistency of the code, it provided that confession\r\nwas not requisite for conviction; irrefragable external evidence was\r\nsufficient; and yet even when such evidence was had, the judge was\r\nempowered to torture in mere surplusage.[1647] Yet there was a great\r\nshow of tender consideration for the accused. When the weight of\r\nconflicting evidence inclined to the side of the prisoner, torture was\r\nnot to be applied.[1648] Two adverse witnesses, or one unexceptionable\r\none, were a condition precedent, and the legislator shows that he\r\nwas in advance of his age by ruling out all evidence resting on the\r\nassertions of magicians and sorcerers.[1649] To guard against abuse,\r\nthe impossible effort was made to define strictly the exact quality and\r\namount of evidence requisite to justify torture, and the most elaborate\r\nand minute directions were given with respect to all the various\r\nclasses of crime, such as homicide, child-murder, robbery, theft,\r\nreceiving stolen goods, poisoning, arson, treason, sorcery, and the\r\nlike;[1650] while the judge administering torture to an innocent man on\r\ninsufficient grounds was liable to make good all damage or suffering\r\nthereby inflicted.[1651] The amount of torment, moreover, was to be\r\nproportioned to the age, sex, and strength of the patient; women during\r\npregnancy were never to be subjected to it; and in no case was it to be\r\ncarried to such a point as to cause permanent injury or death.[1652]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFINAL SHAPE OF THE TORTURE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles V. was too astute a ruler not to recognize the aid derivable\r\nfrom the doctrines of the Roman law in his scheme of restoring the\r\npreponderance of the Kaisership, and he lost no opportunity of\r\nengrafting them on the jurisprudence of Germany. In his Criminal\r\nConstitutions, however, he took care to embody largely the legislation\r\nof his predecessors and contemporaries, and though protests were\r\nuttered by many of the Teutonic princes, the code, adopted by the\r\nDiet of Ratisbon in 1532, became part and parcel of the common law\r\nof Germany.[1653] A fair idea of the shape assumed, under these\r\ninfluences, by the criminal law in its relations with torture, can\r\nbe obtained by examining some of the legal text-books which were\r\ncurrent as manuals of practice from the sixteenth to the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[1654] As most of the authors of these works appear to condemn\r\nthe principle or to lament the necessity of torture, their instructions\r\nas to its employment may safely be assumed to represent the most humane\r\nand enlightened views current during the period.[1655] It is easy to\r\nsee from them, however, that though the provisions of the Caroline\r\nConstitutions were still mostly in force, yet the practice had greatly\r\nextended itself, and that the limitations prescribed for the protection\r\nof innocence and helplessness had become of little real effect.\r\n\r\nUpon the theory of the Roman law, nobles and the learned professions\r\nhad claimed immunity from torture, and the Roman law inspired too\r\nsincere a respect to permit a denial of the claim,[1656] yet the\r\ningenuity of lawyers reduced the privilege to such narrow proportions\r\nthat it was practically almost valueless. For certain crimes, of\r\ncourse, such as _majestas_, adultery, and incest, the authority of\r\nthe Roman law admitted of no exceptions, and to these were speedily\r\nadded a number of other offences, classed as _crimina excepta_ or\r\n_nefanda_, which were made to embrace almost all offences of a\r\ncapital nature, in which alone torture was as a rule allowable. Thus,\r\npatricide, uxoricide, fratricide, witchcraft, sorcery, counterfeiting,\r\ntheft, sacrilege, rape, arson, repeated homicide, etc., came to be\r\nincluded in the exceptional cases, and the only privileges extended in\r\nthem to nobles were that they should not be subjected to “plebeian”\r\ntortures.[1657] As early as 1514, I find an instance which shows how\r\nlittle advantage these prerogatives afforded in practice. A certain\r\nDr. Bobenzan, a citizen of good repute and syndic of Erfurt, who\r\nboth by position and profession belonged to the excepted class, when\r\nbrought up for sentence on a charge of conspiring to betray the city,\r\nand warned that he could retract his confession, extracted under\r\ntorture, pathetically replied—“During my examination, I was at one\r\ntime stretched upon the rack for six hours, and at another I was\r\nslowly burned for eight hours. If I retract, I shall be exposed to\r\nthese torments again and again. I had rather die”—and he was duly\r\nhanged.[1658] In fact, all these exemptions were rather theoretical\r\nthan practical, and they were speedily set aside.[1659]\r\n\r\nIn Catholic countries, of course, the clergy were specially favored,\r\nbut the immunity claimed for them by the canon law was practically\r\nreduced to nearly the same as that accorded to nobles.[1660] The\r\ntorture inflicted on them, however, was lighter than in the case of\r\nlaymen, and proof of a much more decided character was required to\r\njustify their being exposed to torment. As an illustration of this,\r\nvon Rosbach remarks that if a layman is found in the house of a pretty\r\nwoman, most authors consider the fact sufficient to justify torture on\r\nthe charge of adultery, but that this is not the case with priests, who\r\nif they are caught embracing a woman are presumed to be merely blessing\r\nher.[1661] They moreover had the privilege of being tortured only at\r\nthe hands of clerical executioners, if such were to be had.[1662]\r\nIn Protestant territories respect for the cloth was manifested by\r\ndegrading them prior to administering the rack or strappado.[1663]\r\n\r\nSome limitations were imposed as to age and strength. Children under\r\nfourteen could not be tortured, nor the aged whose vigor was unequal to\r\nthe endurance, but the latter could be tied to the rack, and menaced\r\nto the last extremity; and the elasticity of the rule is manifested in\r\na case which attracted attention at Halle in the eighteenth century,\r\nin which a man more than eighty years of age was decided to be fit to\r\nbear the infliction, and only escaped by opportunely dying.[1664] In\r\nfact, Grillandus argues that age confers no immunity from torture,\r\nbut that a humane judge will inflict it only moderately, except in\r\natrocious crimes; as for children, though regular torture could not be\r\nemployed on them, the rod could be legitimately used.[1665] Insanity\r\nwas likewise a safeguard, and much discussion was had as to whether\r\nthe deaf, dumb, and blind were liable or not. Zanger decides in the\r\naffirmative whenever, whether as principals or witnesses, good evidence\r\nwas to be expected from them;[1666] and Scialoja points out that though\r\ndeaf-mutes as a rule are not to be tortured because they cannot dictate\r\na confession, yet if they can read and write so as to understand the\r\naccusation and write out what they have to say, they are fit subjects\r\nfor the torturer.[1667] Pregnant women also were exempt until forty\r\ndays after childbed, even though they had become so in prison for\r\nthe express purpose of postponing the infliction.[1668] Some kinds\r\nof disease likewise conferred exemption, and jurisconsults undertook\r\nwith their customary minuteness to define with precision this nosology\r\nof torture, leading to discussions more prolonged than profitable.\r\nGout, for instance, gave rise to doubt, and some authors were found to\r\naffirm that they knew of cases in which gouty patients had been cured\r\nby a brisk application of the implements of the _marter-kammer_ or\r\ntorture-chamber.[1669] Other legists gravely disputed whether in the\r\ncase of epileptics the judge should bear in mind the aspects of the\r\nmoon and the equinoxes and solstices, at which times the paroxysms of\r\nthe disease were apt to be more violent. Those who thus escaped torture\r\non account of disease presented a problem which the jurists solved in\r\ntheir ordinary fashion by condemning them to some other punishment than\r\nthat provided for the crime of which they had been accused but not\r\nconvicted.[1670]\r\n\r\nIn theory the accused could be tortured only once, but this, like all\r\nother restrictions in favor of humanity, amounted to but little. A\r\nrepetition of torture could be justified on the ground that the first\r\napplication had been light or insufficient; the production of fresh\r\nevidence authorized a second and even a third infliction; a failure to\r\npersevere in confession after torture rendered a repetition requisite;\r\nand even a variation in the confession required confirmation by the\r\nrack or strappado.[1671] Many writers affirm that a second torture is\r\nrequisite to purge away the defect of the infamy incurred by confession\r\nunder the first, as well as to strengthen the evidence against\r\naccomplices.[1672] In fact, some authorities go so far as to place it\r\nentirely at the discretion of the judge whether the accused shall be\r\nsubjected or not to repeated torment without fresh evidence,[1673]\r\nand Del Rio mentions a case occurring in Westphalia wherein a man\r\naccused of lycanthropy was tortured twenty times.[1674] This practice\r\nof repeating torture we are told by many authorities was exceedingly\r\ncommon.[1675]\r\n\r\nAnother positive rule was that torture could only be applied in\r\naccusations involving life or limb.[1676] Thus, for instance, in\r\nprovinces where usury was punishable only by confiscation, torture\r\ncould not be used to prove it, but where it entailed also some corporal\r\ninfliction, the accused could be subjected to the rack.[1677] Yet\r\nwhen Bologna undertook to remove the abuses of her torture system she\r\nstill allowed it in cases involving a pecuniary fine of a hundred\r\nlire, or over.[1678] Whipping being a corporal punishment, and yet a\r\nmuch lighter infliction than torture, the legists were divided as to\r\nwhether a crime for which it was the only penalty was one involving\r\nthe liability of the accused to torture, but the weight of authority,\r\nas usual, leaned to the side of the free employment of the rack.[1679]\r\nAll these fine-spun distinctions, however, were of little moment, for\r\nSenckenberg assures us that he had known torture to be resorted to in\r\nmercantile matters, where money only was at stake.[1680] Slaves could\r\nalways be tortured in civil suits when their testimony was required,\r\nand freemen when there was suspicion of fraud;[1681] and it was a\r\ngeneral rule of mercantile law that it could be employed in accusations\r\nof fraudulent bankruptcy.[1682] How easily, indeed, all these barriers\r\nwere overleaped is seen in the rule that where the penalty was a fine,\r\nand the accused was too poor to pay it, he could be tortured, the\r\ntorture serving in lieu of punishment. Thus, whether he was innocent\r\nor guilty, the judge was determined that he should not escape.[1683]\r\nAnother method in constant use of evading the limitation in offences\r\nwhich by statute did not involve torture was by depriving him of food\r\nin prison, or stripping him of clothes in winter, the slow torment of\r\nstarvation and cold not being classed legally as torture.[1684]\r\n\r\nEqually absolute was the maxim that torture could not be employed\r\nunless there was positive proof that crime of some sort had been\r\ncommitted, for its object was to ascertain the criminal and not the\r\ncrime;[1685] yet von Rosbach remarks that as soon as any one claimed to\r\nhave lost anything by theft, the judges of his day hastened to torture\r\nall suspect, without waiting to determine whether or not the theft had\r\nreally been committed as assumed;[1686] and von Boden declares that\r\nmany tribunals were in the habit of resorting to it in cases wherein\r\nsubsequent developments showed that the alleged crime had really not\r\ntaken place, a proceeding jocosely characterized by a brother lawyer as\r\nputting the cart before the horse, and bridling him by the tail.[1687]\r\nThe history of torture is full of cases illustrating its effectiveness\r\nwhen thus used. Boyvin du Villars relates that during the war in\r\nPiedmont, in 1559, he released from the dungeons of the Marquis of\r\nMasserano an unfortunate gentleman who had been secretly kept there\r\nfor eighteen years, in consequence of having attempted to serve a\r\nprocess from the Duke of Savoy on the marquis. His disappearance having\r\nnaturally been attributed to foul play, his kindred prosecuted an enemy\r\nof the family, who, under stress of torture, duly confessed to having\r\ncommitted the murder, and was accordingly executed in a town where\r\nMasserano himself was residing.[1688] Godelmann relates that a monument\r\nin a church in upper Germany, representing a man broken on a wheel,\r\ncommemorated a case in which two young journeymen set out together to\r\nmake the accustomed tour of the country. One of them returned alone,\r\nclad in the garments of the other, and was suspected of having made way\r\nwith him. He was arrested, and in the absence of all other evidence was\r\npromptly put to the torture, when he confessed the crime in all its\r\ndetails and was executed on the wheel—soon after which his companion\r\nreturned. Another case was that of a young man near Bremen whose\r\nwidowed mother lived in adultery with a servant. The son quarrelled\r\nwith the man, who fled and took service with another employer at a\r\nconsiderable distance. His father, not knowing his departure, accused\r\nthe youth of murder, and torture speedily drew from the latter a\r\nfull confession of the crime, including his throwing the corpse into\r\nthe Weser. Not long after his execution the adulterous serving-man\r\nreappeared and was duly put to death, as also was his father, to make\r\namends for the blunder of the law.[1689]\r\n\r\nA universal prescription existed that the torment should not be so\r\nsevere or so prolonged as to endanger life or limb or to injure\r\nthe patient permanently; but this, like all the other precautions,\r\nwas wholly nugatory. Senckenberg assures us that he was personally\r\ncognizant of cases in which innocent persons had been crippled for\r\nlife by torture under false accusations;[1690] and the meek Jesuit Del\r\nRio, in his instructions to inquisitors, quietly observes that the\r\nflesh should not be wounded nor the bones broken, but that torture\r\ncould scarce be properly administered without more or less dislocation\r\nof the joints.[1691] We may comfort ourselves with the assurance of\r\nGrillandus, that cases were rare in which permanent mutilation or death\r\noccurred under the hands of the torturer,[1692] and this admission\r\nlends point to the advice which Simancas gives to judges, that they\r\nshould warn the accused, when brought into the torture-chamber, that\r\nif he is crippled or dies under the torture he must hold himself\r\naccountable for it in not spontaneously confessing the truth[1693]—a\r\nwarning which was habitually given in the Spanish Inquisition before\r\napplying the torture. Von Boden, moreover, very justly points out the\r\nimpossibility of establishing any rules or limitations of practical\r\nutility, when the capacity of endurance varies so greatly in different\r\nconstitutions, and the executioners had so many devices for heightening\r\nor lessening, within the established bounds, the agony inflicted by\r\nthe various modes of torture allowed by law. Indeed, he does not\r\nhesitate to exclaim that human ingenuity could not invent suffering\r\nmore terrible than was constantly and legally employed, and that Satan\r\nhimself would be unable to increase its refinements.[1694] In this as\r\nin everything else the legists agreed that the discretion of the judge\r\nwas the sole and final arbiter in deciding whether the accused was\r\n“competently” tortured—that is, whether the number and severity of the\r\ninflictions were sufficient to purge him of the adverse evidence.[1695]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the old rules which subjected the judge to some\r\nresponsibility were still nominally in force. When torture was ordered\r\nwithout a preliminary examination, or when it was excessive and caused\r\npermanent injury, the judge was held by some authorities to have acted\r\nthrough malice, and his office was no protection against reclamation\r\nfor damages.[1696] Zanger also quotes the Roman law as still in force,\r\nto the effect that if the accused dies under the torture, and the\r\njudge has been either bribed or led away by passion, his offence is\r\ncapital, while if there had been insufficient preliminary evidence,\r\nhe is punishable at discretion.[1697] But, on the other hand, Baldo\r\ntells us that unless there is evidence of malice the presumption is\r\nin favor of the judge in whose hands a prisoner has died or been\r\npermanently crippled, for he is assumed to have acted through zeal\r\nfor justice,[1698] and though there were some authorities who denied\r\nthis, it seems to have been the general practical conclusion.[1699] The\r\nsecrecy of criminal trials, moreover, offered an almost impenetrable\r\nshield to the judge, and the recital by Godelmann of the various kinds\r\nof evidence by which the prisoner could prove the fact that he had\r\nbeen subjected to torture shows how difficult it was to penetrate into\r\nthe secrets of the tribunals.[1700] According to Damhouder, indeed,\r\nthe judge could clear himself by his own declaration that he had acted\r\nin accordance with the law, and without fraud or malice.[1701] We are\r\ntherefore quite prepared to believe the assertion of Senckenberg that\r\nthe rules protecting the prisoner had become obsolete, and that he had\r\nseen not a few instances of their violation without there being any\r\nidea of holding the judge to accountability,[1702] an assertion which\r\nis substantially confirmed by Goetz.[1703]\r\n\r\nNot the least of the evils of the system, indeed, was its inevitable\r\ninfluence upon the judge himself. He was required by his office to\r\nbe present during the infliction of torture, and to conduct the\r\ninterrogatory personally. Callousness to human suffering, whether\r\nnatural or acquired, thus became a necessity, and the delicate\r\nconscientiousness which should be the moving principle of every\r\nChristian tribunal was well-nigh an impossibility.[1704] Nor was this\r\nall, for when even a conscientious judge had once taken upon himself\r\nthe responsibility of ordering a fellow-being to the torture, every\r\nmotive would lead him to desire the justification of the act by the\r\nextortion of a confession;[1705] and the very idea that he might be\r\npossibly held to accountability, instead of being a safeguard for the\r\nprisoner became a cause of subjecting him to additional agony. Indeed,\r\nthe prudence of persevering in torture until a confession was reached\r\nwas at least recognized, if not advised, by jurists, and in such a\r\nmatter to suggest the idea was practically to recommend it.[1706]\r\nBoth the good and the evil impulses of the judge were thus enlisted\r\nagainst the unfortunate being at his mercy. Human nature was not meant\r\nto face such temptations, and the fearful ingenuity which multiplied\r\nthe endless refinements of torture testifies how utterly humanity\r\nyielded to the thirst of wringing conviction from the weaker party\r\nto the unequal conflict, where he who should have been a passionless\r\narbiter was made necessarily a combatant. How completely the prisoner\r\nthus became a quarry to be hunted to the death is shown by the jocular\r\nremark of Farinacci, a celebrated authority in criminal law, that the\r\ntorture of sleeplessness, invented by Marsigli, was most excellent, for\r\nout of a hundred martyrs exposed to it not two could endure it without\r\nbecoming confessors as well.[1707] Few, when once engaged in such a\r\npursuit, could be expected to follow the example of the Milanese judge,\r\nwho resolved his doubts as to the efficacy of torture in evidence by\r\nkilling a favorite mule, and allowing the accusation to fall upon\r\none of his servants. The man of course denied the offence, was duly\r\ntortured, confessed, and persisted in his confession after torture.\r\nThe judge, thus convinced by experiment of the fallacy of the system,\r\nresigned the office whose duties he could no longer conscientiously\r\ndischarge, and in his subsequent career rose to the cardinalate.\r\nThe mode in which these untoward results were usually treated is\r\nillustrated in another somewhat similar case which was told to Augustin\r\nNicholas at Amsterdam in explanation of the fact that the city was\r\nobliged to borrow a headsman from the neighboring towns whenever the\r\nservices of one were required for an execution. It appears that a\r\nyoung man of Amsterdam, returning home late at night from a revel,\r\nsank upon a doorstep in a drunken sleep. A thief emptied his pockets,\r\nsecuring, among other things, a dirk, with which, a few minutes later,\r\nhe stabbed a man in a quarrel. Returning to the sleeper he slipped the\r\nbloody weapon back to its place. The young man awoke, but before he had\r\ntaken many steps he was seized by the watch, who had just discovered\r\nthe murder. Appearances were against him; he was tortured, confessed,\r\npersisted in confession after torture, and was duly hanged. Soon after\r\nthe real criminal was condemned for another crime, and revealed the\r\nhistory of the previous one, whereupon the States-General of the United\r\nProvinces, using the ordinary logic of the criminal law, deprived the\r\ncity of Amsterdam of its executioner, as a punishment for a result that\r\nwas inevitable under the system.[1708]\r\n\r\nSlight as were the safeguards with which legislators endeavored to\r\nsurround the employment of torture, they thus became almost nugatory\r\nin practice under a system which, in the endeavor to reduce doubts\r\ninto certainties, ended by leaving everything to the discretion of\r\nthe judge. It is instructive to see the parade of insisting upon\r\nthe necessity of strong preliminary evidence,[1709] and to read\r\nthe elaborate details as to the exact kind and amount of testimony\r\nseverally requisite in each description of crime, and then to find that\r\ncommon report was held sufficient to justify torture, or unexplained\r\nabsence before accusation, prevarication under examination, and\r\neven silence; and it is significant of the readiness to resort to\r\nthe question on the slenderest pretexts when we see judges solemnly\r\nwarned that an evil countenance, though it may argue depravity\r\nin general, does not warrant the presumption of actual guilt in\r\nindividual cases;[1710] though pallor, under many circumstances,\r\nwas considered to sanction the application of torture,[1711] even\r\nas a pot containing toads, found in the home of a suspected witch,\r\njustified her being placed on the rack.[1712] In fact, witchcraft,\r\npoisoning, highway robbery, and other crimes difficult of proof,\r\nwere considered to justify the judge in proceeding to torture on\r\nlighter indications than offences in which evidence was more readily\r\nobtainable.[1713] Subtle lawyers thus exhausted their ingenuity in\r\ndiscussing all possible varieties of indications, and there grew up\r\na mass of confused rules, wherein, on many points, each authority\r\ncontradicted the other. In a system which thus waxed so complex, the\r\ndiscretion of the judge at last became the only practical guide, and\r\nthe legal writers themselves acknowledge the worthlessness of the rules\r\nso laboriously constructed when they admit that it is left for his\r\ndecision to determine whether the indications are sufficient to warrant\r\nthe infliction of torture.[1714] How absolute was this discretion, and\r\nhow it was exercised, is manifest when Damhouder declares that in his\r\nday bloodthirsty judges were in the habit of employing the severest\r\ntorture without sufficient proof or investigation, boasting that by\r\nits means they could extract a confession of everything.[1715] This\r\nfact was no novelty, for the practice had existed, we may say, since\r\nthe first introduction of torture. Ippolito dei Marsigli early in\r\nthe sixteenth century speaks of judges habitually torturing without\r\npreliminary evidence, and goes so far as to assert, with all the\r\nweight of his supreme authority, that a victim of such wrongs if he\r\nkilled his inhuman judge could not be held guilty of homicide nor be\r\npunished with death for the slaying.[1716] It was perhaps to avoid this\r\nresponsibility that some of these zealous law-despisers resorted to the\r\nmost irregular means to procure evidence. Godelmann and von Rosbach\r\nboth tell us that the magistrates of their time, in the absence of all\r\nevidence, sometimes had recourse to sorcerers and to various forms of\r\ndivination in order to obtain proof on which they could employ the\r\nrack or strappado. Boys whose shoes were newly greased with lard were\r\nthought to have a special power of detecting witches, and enthusiastic\r\njudges accordingly would sometimes station them, after duly anointing\r\ntheir boots, at the church doors, so that the luckless wretches could\r\nnot get out without being recognized.[1717]\r\n\r\nHow shocking was the abuse made of this arbitrary power is well\r\nillustrated by a case which occurred in the Spanish colony of New\r\nGranada about the year 1580. The judges of the royal court of Santafé\r\nhad rendered themselves odious by their cruelty and covetousness,\r\nwhen one morning some pasquinades against them were found posted in\r\nthe public plaza. Diligent search failed to discover the author, but\r\na victim was found in the person of a young scrivener whose writing\r\nwas thought to bear some resemblance to that of the offensive papers.\r\nHe was at once seized, and though libel was not an offence under the\r\ncivil law which justified the application of torture, he was ordered to\r\nthe rack, when he solemnly warned the judge deputed to inflict it that\r\nif he should die under it he would summon his tormentor to answer in\r\nthe presence of God within three days. The judge was intimidated and\r\nrefused to perform the office, but another was found of sterner stuff,\r\nwho duly performed his functions without extracting a confession, and\r\nthe accused was discharged. Then a man who desired to revenge himself\r\non an enemy asserted that the writing of the latter was like that\r\nof the pasquinades. Juan Rodriguez de los Puertos, the unfortunate\r\nthus designated, was immediately arrested with all his family. An\r\nillegitimate son was promptly tortured, and stated that his father had\r\nwritten the libels and ordered him to post them. Then Juan himself was\r\nordered to the rack, but, while protesting his innocence, he begged\r\nrather to be put to death, as he was too old to endure the torment.\r\nHe was accordingly hanged, and his son was scourged with two hundred\r\nlashes. All that was needed to render manifest the hideous injustice of\r\nthis proceeding was developed a few years later, when the judge who was\r\nafraid to risk the appeal of the first victim was condemned to death\r\nfor an assassination, and on the scaffold confessed that he himself had\r\nbeen the author of the libels against his brother justices.[1718]\r\n\r\nSuch a system tends of necessity to its own extension, and it\r\nis therefore not surprising to find that the aid of torture was\r\nincreasingly invoked. The prisoner who refused to plead, whether there\r\nwas any evidence against him or not, could be tortured until his\r\nobstinacy gave way.[1719] Even witnesses were not spared, whether in\r\ncivil suits or criminal prosecutions.[1720] It was discretionary with\r\nthe judge to inflict moderate torture on them when the truth could\r\nnot otherwise be ascertained. Witnesses of low degree could always be\r\ntortured for the purpose of supplying the defect in their testimony\r\narising from their condition of life. Some jurists, indeed, held that\r\nno witness of low or vile condition could be heard without torture, but\r\nothers maintained that poverty alone was not sufficient to render it\r\nnecessary. Witnesses who were infamous could not be admitted to testify\r\nwithout torture; those of good standing were tortured only when they\r\nprevaricated, or when they were apparently committing perjury;[1721]\r\nbut, as this was necessarily left with the judges to determine,\r\nthe instructions for him to guide his decision by observing their\r\nappearance and manner show how completely the whole case was in his\r\npower, and how readily he could extort evidence to justify the torture\r\nof the prisoner, and then extract from the latter a confession by the\r\nsame means. In prosecutions for treason, all witnesses, irrespective\r\nof their rank, were liable to torture,[1722] so that when Pius IV.,\r\nin 1560, was determined to ruin Cardinal Carlo Caraffa, no scruple\r\nwas felt, during his trial, as to torturing his friends and retainers\r\nto obtain the evidence upon which he was executed.[1723] There was\r\na general rule that witnesses could not be tortured until after the\r\nexamination of the accused, because, if he confessed, their evidence\r\nwas superfluous; but there were exceptions even to this, for if the\r\ncriminal was not within the power of the court, witnesses could be\r\ntortured to obtain evidence against him in his absence.[1724] Indeed,\r\nin the effort made early in the sixteenth century to reform the abuse\r\nof torture in Bologna, it was provided that if there were evidence to\r\nshow that a man was acquainted with a crime he could be tortured to\r\nobtain evidence on which to base a prosecution, and this before any\r\nproceedings had been commenced against the delinquent.[1725] Evidently\r\nthere was no limit to the uses to which torture could be put by a\r\ndetermined legislator.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious plan was also adopted by which, when two witnesses\r\ngave testimony irreconcilable with each other, their comparative\r\ncredibility was tested by torturing both simultaneously in each\r\nother’s presence.[1726] Evidence given under torture was esteemed\r\nthe best kind, and yet with the perpetually recurring inconsistency\r\nwhich marks this branch of criminal law it was admitted that the\r\nspontaneous testimony of a man of good character could outweigh that of\r\na disreputable person under torment.[1727] Witnesses, however, could\r\nnot be tortured more than three times;[1728] and it was a question\r\nmooted between jurists whether their evidence thus given required,\r\nlike the confession of an accused person, to be subsequently ratified\r\nby them.[1729] A reminiscence of Roman law, moreover, is visible in\r\nthe rule that no witness could be tortured against his kindred to the\r\nseventh degree, nor against his near connections by marriage, his\r\nfeudal superiors, or other similar persons.[1730]\r\n\r\nThere doubtless was good reason underlying the Roman rule, universally\r\nfollowed by modern legists, that, whenever several parties were on\r\ntrial under the same accusation, the torturer should commence with the\r\nweakest and tenderest, for thus it was expected that a confession could\r\nsoonest be extracted; but this eager determination to secure conviction\r\ngave rise to a refinement of cruelty in the prescription that if a\r\nhusband and wife were arraigned together, the wife should be tortured\r\nfirst, and in the presence of her husband; and if a father and son, the\r\nson before his father’s face.[1731]\r\n\r\nGrillandus, who seems to have been an unusually humane judge, describes\r\nfive degrees of torture, using as a standard the favorite strappado.\r\nThe first is purely mental—stripping the prisoner and tying his hands\r\nbehind him to the rope, but not hurting him. This can be used when\r\nthere is no evidence, and he tells us he had found it very efficacious,\r\nespecially with the timid and infirm. The other grades are indicated\r\nin accordance with the strength of the proof and the heinousness of\r\nthe crime. The second is hoisting the accused and letting him hang for\r\nthe space of an Ave or a Pater Noster, or even a Miserere, but not\r\nelevating him and letting him fall with a jerk. In the third grade this\r\nsuspension is prolonged. In the fourth he is allowed to hang for a time\r\nvarying from a quarter of an hour to an hour, according to the crime\r\nand the evidence, and he is jerked two or three times. In the fifth and\r\nseverest form a weight is attached to his feet and he is repeatedly\r\njerked. This Grillandus describes as terrible; the whole body is\r\ntorn, the limbs are ready to part from the trunk, and death itself is\r\npreferable. It should only, he says, be used in the gravest crimes,\r\nsuch as heresy or treason, but we have already seen that it was mild in\r\ncomparison with many inflictions habitually employed.[1732]\r\n\r\nSome facilities for defence were allowed to the accused, but in\r\npractice they were almost hopelessly slender. He was permitted to\r\nemploy counsel, and if unable to do so, it was the duty of the judge\r\nto look up testimony for the defence.[1733] After all the adverse\r\ntestimony had been taken, and the prisoner had been interrogated,\r\nhe could ask to see a copy of the proceedings, in order to frame a\r\ndefence; but the request could be refused, in which case, the judge\r\nwas bound to sift the evidence himself, and to investigate the\r\nprobabilities of innocence or guilt. Von Rosbach states that judges\r\nwere not in the habit of granting the request, though no authority\r\njustified them in the refusal;[1734] and half a century later this is\r\nconfirmed by Bernhardi, who gives as a reason that by withholding the\r\nproceedings from the accused they saved themselves trouble.[1735] The\r\nright of the accused to see the evidence adduced against him was still\r\nan open question so recently as 1742, for Goetz deems it necessary to\r\nargue at some length to prove it.[1736] The recognized tendency of such\r\na system to result in an unfavorable conclusion is shown by Zanger’s\r\nelaborate instructions on this point, and his warning that, however\r\njustifiable torture may seem, it ought not to be resorted to without\r\nat least looking at the evidence which may be attainable in favor of\r\ninnocence;[1737] while von Rosbach characterizes as the greatest fault\r\nof the tribunals of his day, their neglect to obtain and consider\r\ntestimony for the accused as well as against him.[1738] Indeed, when\r\nthe public interest was deemed to require it, all safeguards were\r\nwithdrawn from the prisoner, as when, in 1719 in Saxony, a mandate\r\nwas issued declaring that in cases of thieves and robbers no defence\r\nor exceptions or delays were to be admitted.[1739] In some special and\r\nextraordinary cases, the judge might allow the accused to be confronted\r\nwith the accuser, but this was so contrary to the secrecy required by\r\nthe inquisitorial system, that he was cautioned that it was a very\r\nunusual course, and one not lightly to be allowed, as it was odious,\r\nunnecessary, and not pertinent to the trial.[1740]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, there was a right of appeal against an order to inflict\r\ntorture, but this, even when permitted, could usually avail the accused\r\nbut little, for the _ex parte_ testimony which had satisfied the lower\r\njudge could, of course, in most instances, be so presented to the\r\nhigher court as to insure the affirmation of the order, and prisoners,\r\nin their helplessness, would doubtless feel that by the attempt\r\nto appeal they would probably only increase the severity of their\r\ninevitable sufferings.[1741] Moreover, such appeals were ingeniously\r\nand effectually discouraged by subjecting the advocate of the prisoner\r\nto a fine or some extraordinary punishment if the appeal was pronounced\r\nto be frivolous;[1742] and some authorities, among which was the great\r\nname of Carpzovius, denied that in the inquisitorial process there was\r\nany necessity of communicating to the accused the order to subject\r\nhim to torture and then allow him time to appeal against it if so\r\ndisposed.[1743]\r\n\r\nSlender as were these safeguards in principle, they were reduced\r\nin practice almost to a nullity. That the discretion lodged in the\r\ntribunals was habitually and frightfully abused is only too evident,\r\nwhen von Rosbach deems it necessary to reprove, as a common error of\r\nthe judges of his time, the idea that the use of torture was a matter\r\naltogether dependent upon their pleasure, “as though nature had created\r\nthe bodies of prisoners for them to lacerate at will.”[1744] Thus it\r\nwas an acknowledged rule that when guilt could be satisfactorily proved\r\nby witnesses, torture was not admissible;[1745] yet Damhouder feels it\r\nnecessary to condemn the practice of some judges, who, after conviction\r\nby sufficient evidence, were in the habit of torturing the convict,\r\nand boasted that they never pronounced sentence of death without\r\nhaving first extorted a confession.[1746] Moreover, the practice was\r\ncontinued which we have seen habitual in the Châtelet of Paris in the\r\nfourteenth century, whereby, after a man had been duly convicted of\r\na capital crime, he was tortured to extract confessions of any other\r\noffences of which he might be guilty;[1747] and as late as 1764,\r\nBeccaria lifts his voice against it as a still existing abuse, which he\r\nwell qualifies as senseless curiosity, impertinent in the wantonness\r\nof its cruelty.[1748] Martin Bernhardi, writing in 1705, asserts that\r\nthis torture after confession and conviction was also resorted to in\r\norder to prevent the convict from appealing from the sentence.[1749]\r\nSo, although a man who freely confessed a crime could not be tortured,\r\naccording to the general principle of the law, still, if in his\r\nconfession he adduced mitigating circumstances, he could be tortured\r\nin order to force him to withdraw them;[1750] and, moreover, if he were\r\nsuspected of having accomplices and refused to name them, he could be\r\ntortured as in the _question préalable_ of the French courts.[1751] Yet\r\nthe accusation thus obtained was held to be of so little value that it\r\nonly warranted the arrest of the parties incriminated, who could not\r\nlegally be tortured without further evidence.[1752] In the face of all\r\nthis it seems like jesting mockery to find these grim legists tenderly\r\nsuggesting that the prisoner should be tortured only in the morning\r\nlest his health should suffer by subjecting him to the question after a\r\nfull meal.[1753]\r\n\r\nIf the practice of the criminal courts had been devised with the\r\npurpose of working injustice under the sacred name of law it could\r\nscarce have been different. Even the inalienable privilege of being\r\nheard in his defence was habitually refused to the accused by many\r\ntribunals, which proceeded at once to torture after hearing the adverse\r\nevidence, a refinement of cruelty and injustice which called forth\r\nlabored arguments by von Rosbach and Simancas to prove its impropriety,\r\nthus showing it to be widely practised.[1754] In the same way, the\r\nright to appeal from an order to torture was evaded by judges, who\r\nsent the prisoner to the rack without a preliminary formal order, thus\r\ndepriving him of the opportunity of appealing.[1755] Indeed, in time\r\nit was admitted by many jurists that the judge at his pleasure could\r\nrefuse to allow an appeal; and that in no case was he to wait more than\r\nten days for the decision of the superior tribunal.[1756]\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which torture was used is manifested in the low\r\nrate which was paid for its application. In the municipal accounts\r\nof Valenciennes, between 1538 and 1573, the legal fee paid to the\r\nexecutioner for each torturing of a prisoner is only two sous and a\r\nhalf, while he is allowed the same sum for the white gloves worn at an\r\nexecution, and ten sous are given him for such light jobs as piercing\r\nthe tongue.[1757]\r\n\r\nWith all this hideous accumulation of cruelty which shrank from nothing\r\nin the effort to wring a confession from the wretched victim, that\r\nconfession, when thus so dearly obtained, was estimated at its true\r\nworthlessness. It was insufficient for conviction unless confirmed by\r\nthe accused in a subsequent examination beyond the confines of the\r\ntorture-chamber, at an interval of from one to three days.[1758] This\r\nconfirmation was by no means universal, and the treatment of cases\r\nof retracted confession was the subject of much debate. Bodin, in\r\n1579, complains that witches sometimes denied what they had confessed\r\nunder torture, and that the puzzled judge was then obliged to release\r\nthem.[1759] Such a result, however, was so totally at variance with\r\nthe determination to obtain a conviction which marks the criminal\r\njurisprudence of the period that it was not likely to be submitted\r\nto with patience. Accordingly the general practice was that, if the\r\nconfession was retracted, the accused was again tortured, when a second\r\nconfession and retraction made an exceedingly awkward dilemma for\r\nthe subtle jurisconsults. They agreed that he should not be allowed\r\nto escape after giving so much trouble. Some advocated the regular\r\npunishment of his crime, others demanded for him an extraordinary\r\npenalty; some, again, were in favor of incarcerating him;[1760] others\r\nassumed that he should be tortured a third time, when a confession,\r\nfollowed as before by a recantation, released him from further\r\ntorment, for the admirable reason that nature and justice alike\r\nabhorred infinity.[1761] This was too metaphysical for some jurists,\r\nwho referred the whole question to the discretion of the judge, with\r\npower to prolong the series of alternate confession and retraction\r\nindefinitely, acting doubtless on the theory that most prisoners were\r\nlike the scamp spoken of by Ippolito dei Marsigli, who, after repeated\r\ntortures and revocations, when asked by the judge why he retracted\r\nhis confession so often, replied that he would rather be tortured a\r\nthousand times in the arms than once in the neck, for he could easily\r\nfind a doctor to set his arm but never one to set his neck.[1762]\r\nThe magistrates in some places were in the habit of imprisoning or\r\nbanishing such persons, thus punishing them without conviction,\r\nand inflicting a penalty unsuited to the crime of which they were\r\naccused.[1763] Others solved the knotty problem by judiciously advising\r\nthat in the uncertainty of doubt as to his guilt, the prisoner should\r\nbe soundly scourged and turned loose, after taking an oath not to\r\nbring an action for false imprisonment against his tormentors;[1764]\r\nbut, according to some authorities, this kind of oath, or _urpheda_\r\nas it was called, was of no legal value.[1765] Towards the end of\r\nthe torture system, however, the more humane though not very logical\r\ndoctrine prevailed in Germany that a retraction absolved the accused,\r\nunless new and different evidence was brought forward, and this had to\r\nbe stronger and clearer than before, for the presumption of innocence\r\nwas now with the accused, the torture having purged him of former\r\nsuspicion.[1766]\r\n\r\nThis necessity of repeating a confession after torture gave rise to\r\nanother question which caused considerable difference of opinion among\r\ndoctors, namely, whether witnesses who were tortured had to confirm\r\ntheir evidence subsequently, and whether they, in case of retraction\r\nor the presentation of fresh evidence, could be tortured repeatedly.\r\nAs usual in doubts respecting torture, the weight of authority was in\r\nfavor of its most liberal use.[1767]\r\n\r\nThere were other curious inconsistencies in the system which manifest\r\nstill more clearly the real estimate placed on confessions under\r\ntorture. If the torture had been inflicted by an over-zealous judge\r\nwithout proper preliminary evidence, confession amounted legally to\r\nnothing, even though proofs were subsequently discovered.[1768] If, on\r\nthe other hand, absolute and incontrovertible proof of guilt were had,\r\nand the over-zealous judge tortured in surplusage without extracting\r\na confession, there arose another of the knotty points to which\r\nthe torture system inevitably tended and about which jurisconsults\r\ndiffered. Some held that he was to be absolved, because torture\r\npurged him of all the evidence against him; others argued that he\r\nwas to be punished with the full penalty of his crime, because the\r\ntorture was illegal and therefore null and void; others again took\r\na middle course and decided that he was to be visited, not with the\r\npenalty of his crime, but with something else, at the discretion of\r\nhis judge.[1769] According to law, indeed, torture without confession\r\nwas a full acquittal; but here, again, practice intervened to destroy\r\nwhat little humanity was admitted by jurists, and the accused under\r\nsuch circumstances was still held suspect, and was liable at any\r\nmoment to be tried again for the same offence.[1770] Indeed, at a\r\ncomparatively early period after the introduction of torture, we\r\nare told that if the accused endured it without confession he was\r\nto be kept in prison to see whether new evidence might not turn\r\nup: if none came, then the judge was to assign him a reasonable\r\ndelay for his defence; he was regularly tried, when if convicted\r\nhe was punished; if not he was discharged.[1771] If, again, a man\r\nand woman were tortured on an accusation of adultery committed with\r\neach other, and if one confessed while the other did not, both were\r\nacquitted according to some authorities, while others held that the\r\none who confessed should receive some punishment different from that\r\nprovided for the crime, while the accomplice was to be discharged\r\non taking a purgatorial oath.[1772] Nothing more contradictory and\r\nillogical can well be imagined, and, as if to crown the absurdity of\r\nthe whole, torture after conviction was allowed in order to prevent\r\nappeals; and if the unfortunate, at the place of execution, chanced\r\nto assert his innocence, he was often hurried from the scaffold to\r\nthe rack in obedience to the theory that the confession must remain\r\nunretracted;[1773] though, if the judge had taken the precaution to\r\nhave the prisoner’s ratification of his confession duly certified to by\r\na notary and witnesses, this trouble might be avoided, and the culprit\r\nbe promptly executed in spite of his retraction.[1774] One can scarce\r\nrepress a grim smile at finding that this series of horrors had pious\r\ndefenders who urged that a merciful consideration for the offender’s\r\nsoul required that he should be brought to confess his iniquities\r\nin order to secure his eternal salvation.[1775] It was a minor, yet\r\nnone the less a flagrant injustice, that when a man had endured the\r\ntorture without confession, and was therefore discharged as innocent,\r\nhe or his heirs were obliged to defray the whole expenses of his\r\nprosecution.[1776]\r\n\r\nThe atrocity of this whole system of so-called criminal justice is\r\nforcibly described by the honest indignation of Augustin Nicolas, who,\r\nin his judicial capacity under Louis XIV., had ample opportunities\r\nof observing its practical working and results. “The strappado, so\r\ncommon in Italy, and which yet is forbidden under the Roman law ...\r\nthe vigils of Spain, which oblige a man to support himself by sheer\r\nmuscular effort for seven hours, to avoid sitting on a pointed iron,\r\nwhich pierces him with insufferable pain; the vigils of Florence,\r\nor of Marsiglio, which have been described above; our iron stools\r\nheated to redness, on which we place poor half-witted women accused of\r\nwitchcraft, exhausted by frightful imprisonment, rotting from their\r\ndark and filthy dungeons, loaded with chains, fleshless, and half\r\ndead; and we pretend that the human frame can resist these devilish\r\npractices, and that the confessions which our wretched victims make of\r\neverything that may be charged against them are true.”[1777] Under such\r\na scheme of jurisprudence, it is easy to understand and appreciate the\r\ncase of the unfortunate peasant, sentenced for witchcraft, who, in his\r\ndying confession to the priest, admitted that he was a sorcerer, and\r\nhumbly welcomed death as the fitting retribution for the unpardonable\r\ncrimes of which he had been found guilty, but pitifully inquired of\r\nthe shuddering confessor whether one could not be a sorcerer without\r\nknowing it.[1778]\r\n\r\nIf anything were wanting to show how completely the inquisitorial\r\nprocess turned all the chances against the accused, it is to be found\r\nin the quaint advice given by Damhouder. He counsels the prisoner,\r\nwhen required to plead, to prevent his judge from taking advantage of\r\nany adverse points that might occur, as, for instance, in a charge of\r\nhomicide to assert his innocence, but to add that, if he were proved\r\nto have committed the crime, he then declares it to have been done in\r\nself-defence.[1779]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen above how great was the part of the Inquisition in\r\nintroducing and moulding the whole system of torture on the ruins\r\nof the feudal law. Even so, in the reconstruction of European\r\njurisprudence, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the\r\nardor of the inquisitorial proceedings against witchcraft, and the\r\npanic on the subject which long pervaded Christendom, had a powerful\r\ninfluence in familiarizing the minds of men with the use of torture as\r\na necessary instrument of justice, and in authorizing its employment to\r\nan extent which now is almost inconceivable.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period, torture was recognized as indispensable in\r\nall trials for sorcery and magic. In 358, an edict of Constantius\r\ndecreed that no dignity of birth or station should protect those\r\naccused of such offences from its application in the severest\r\nform.[1780] How universal its employment thus became is evident from a\r\ncanon of the council of Merida, in 666, declaring that priests, when\r\nsick, sometimes accused the slaves of their churches of bewitching\r\nthem, and impiously tortured them against all ecclesiastical\r\nrules.[1781] It was, therefore, natural that all such crimes should\r\nbe regarded as peculiarly subjecting all suspected of them to the\r\nlast extremity of torture, and its use in the trials of witches and\r\nsorcerers came to be regarded as indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe necessity which all men felt that these crimes should be\r\nextirpated with merciless severity, and the impalpable nature of\r\nthe testimony on which the tribunals had mostly to depend, added to\r\nthis traditional belief in the fitness of torture. Witchcraft was\r\nconsidered as peculiarly difficult of proof, and torture consequently\r\nbecame an unfailing resource to the puzzled tribunal, although every\r\nlegal safeguard was refused to the wretched criminal, and the widest\r\nlatitude of evidence was allowed. Bodin expressly declares that in\r\nso fearful a crime no rules of procedure are to be observed.[1782]\r\nSons were admitted to testify against their fathers, and young girls\r\nwere regarded as the best of witnesses against their mothers; the\r\ndisrepute of a witness was no bar to the reception of his testimony,\r\nand even children of irresponsible age were allowed to swear before\r\nthey rightly knew the nature of the oath on which hung the life of\r\na parent. Boguet, who presided over a tribunal in Franche Comté, in\r\nstating this rule relates a most pathetic case of his own in which a\r\nman named Guillaume Vuillermoz was convicted on the testimony of his\r\nson, aged twelve, and the hardened nerves of the judge were wrung at\r\nthe despair of the unhappy prisoner on being confronted with his child,\r\nwho persisted in his story with a callousness only to be explained by\r\nthe will of God, who stifled in him all natural affection in order to\r\nbring to condign punishment this most hideous offence.[1783] Louïse\r\nprints the records of a trial in 1662, wherein Philippe Polus was\r\ncondemned on the evidence of his daughter, a child in her ninth year.\r\nThere seems to have been no other proof against him, and according\r\nto her own testimony the girl had been a sorceress since her fourth\r\nyear.[1784] Even advocates and counsel could be forced to give evidence\r\nagainst their clients.[1785] Notwithstanding the ample resources thus\r\nafforded for conviction, Jacob Rickius, who, as a magistrate during an\r\nepidemic of witchcraft, at the close of the sixteenth century, had the\r\nfullest practical experience on the subject, complains that no reliance\r\ncould be placed on legal witnesses to produce conviction;[1786] and Del\r\nRio only expresses the general opinion when he avers that torture is\r\nto be more readily resorted to in witchcraft than in other crimes, in\r\nconsequence of the extreme difficulty of its proof.[1787]\r\n\r\nEven the widespread belief that Satan aided his worshippers in\r\ntheir extremity by rendering them insensible to pain did not serve\r\nto relax the efforts of the extirpators of witchcraft, though they\r\ncould hardly avoid the conclusion that they were punishing only the\r\ninnocent, and allowing the guilty to escape. Boguet, indeed, seems to\r\nrecognize this practical inconsistency, and, though it is permissible\r\nto use torture even during church festivals, he advises the judge not\r\nto have recourse to it because of its inutility.[1788] How little\r\nhis advice was heeded, and how little the courts deemed themselves\r\nable to dispense with torture, is shown in the charter of Hainault\r\nof 1619 where in these cases the tribunal is authorized to employ it\r\nto ascertain the truth of the charge, or to discover accomplices, or\r\n_for any other purpose_.[1789] In this dilemma, various means were\r\nadopted to circumvent the arch enemy, of which the one most generally\r\nresorted to was that of shaving the whole person carefully before\r\napplying the torture,[1790] a process which served as an excuse for\r\nthe most indecent outrages upon female prisoners. Yet notwithstanding\r\nall the precautions of the most experienced exorcists, we find in\r\nthe bloody farce of Urbain Grandier that the fiercest torments left\r\nhim in capital spirits and good humor.[1791] Damhouder relates at\r\nmuch length a curious case which occurred under his own eyes while\r\nmember of the council of Bruges, when he assisted at the torture of a\r\nreputed witch who had exercised her power only in good works. During\r\nthree examinations, she bore the severest torture without shrinking,\r\nsometimes sleeping and sometimes defiantly snapping her fingers at the\r\njudges. At length, during the process of shaving, a slip of parchment\r\ncovered with cabalistic characters was found concealed in her person,\r\nand on its removal she was speedily brought to acknowledge her pact\r\nwith the Evil One.[1792] The tender-hearted Rickius was so convinced\r\nof this source of uncertainty that he was accustomed to administer the\r\ncold-water ordeal to all the miserable old women brought before him\r\non such charges, but he is careful to inform us that this was only\r\npreparatory proof, to enable him with a safer conscience to torture\r\nthose who were so ill-advised as to float instead of sinking.[1793]\r\nGrillandus tells us that he had met with cases in which the\r\ninsensibility to the severest tortures was so complete that only magic\r\narts could explain it; the patient seemed to be supported in the air,\r\nor to be in a profound stupor, and he mentions some of the formulas\r\nwhich were employed for the purpose. In one case at Rome a notorious\r\nthief suspected of a large robbery came to him voluntarily and said\r\nhe wanted to purge himself of the rumors against him. He was tortured\r\nrepeatedly in various ways; when the operation began he muttered\r\nsomething and fell into a stupor in which he was absolutely insensible.\r\nAfter exhausting his ingenuity, Grillandus had to discharge him. In\r\nanother case the formula “Quemadmodum lac beatæ,” etc., produced the\r\nsame effect.[1794]\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the Cappadocians of old were said to harden their\r\nchildren with torture in order that they might profitably follow the\r\nprofession of false witnesses, there existed so general a belief among\r\nexperienced men that criminals of all kinds had secrets with which\r\nto deaden sensibility to torture that it is not improbable that the\r\nunfortunates occasionally were able to strengthen their endurance with\r\nsome anæsthetic. Boguet complains that in modern times torture had\r\nbecome almost useless not only with sorcerers but with criminals in\r\ngeneral, and Damhouder asserts that professional malefactors were in\r\nthe habit of torturing each other in order to be hardened when brought\r\nto justice, in consequence of which he advises the judge to inquire\r\ninto the antecedents of prisoners, in order to proportion the severity\r\nof the torture to the necessities of the case.[1795]\r\n\r\nWhen the concentrated energies of these ingenious and determined\r\nlaw dispensers failed to extort by such means a confession from the\r\nwretched clowns and gossips thus placed at their mercy, they were even\r\nyet not wholly at fault. The primitive teachings of the Inquisition\r\nof the thirteenth century were not yet obsolete; they were instructed\r\nto treat the prisoner kindly, and to introduce into his dungeon some\r\nprepossessing agent who should make friends with him and induce him\r\nto confess what was wanted of him, promising to influence the judge\r\nto pardon, when at that moment the judge is to enter the cell and\r\nto promise grace, with the mental reservation that his grace should\r\nbe shown to the community and not to the prisoner.[1796] Or, still\r\nfollowing the ancient traditions, spies were to be confined with\r\nhim, who should profess to be likewise sorcerers and thus lead him to\r\nincriminate himself, or else the unhappy wretch was to be told that\r\nhis associate prisoners had borne testimony against him, in order to\r\ninduce him to revenge himself by turning witness against them.[1797]\r\nBoguet, indeed, does not consider it correct to mislead the accused\r\nwith promises of pardon, and though it was generally approved by\r\nlegists, he decides against it.[1798] Simancas also considers such\r\nartifices to be illegal, and that a confession thus procured could be\r\nretracted.[1799] Del Rio, on the other hand, while loftily condemning\r\nthe outspoken trickery recommended by Sprenger and Bodin, proceeds to\r\ndraw a careful distinction between _dolum bonum_ and _dolum malum_.\r\nHe forbids absolute lying, but advises equivocation and ambiguous\r\npromises, and then, if the prisoner is deceived, he has only himself to\r\nthank for it.[1800] In fact, these men conceived that they were engaged\r\nin a direct and personal struggle with the Evil One, and that Satan\r\ncould only be overcome with his own arts.\r\n\r\nWhen the law thus pitilessly turned all the chances against the victim,\r\nit is easy to understand that few escaped. In the existing condition\r\nof popular frenzy on the subject, there was no one but could feel that\r\nhe might at any moment be brought under accusation by personal enemies\r\nor by unfortunates compelled on the rack to declare the names of all\r\nwhom they might have seen congregated at the witches’ sabbat. We can\r\nthus readily comprehend the feelings of those who, living under such\r\nuncertainties, coolly and deliberately made up their minds in advance\r\nthat, if chance should expose them to suspicion, they would at once\r\nadmit everything that the inquisitors might desire of them, preferring\r\na speedy death to one more lingering and scarcely less certain.[1801]\r\nThe evil fostered with such careful exaggeration grew to so great\r\nproportions that Father Tanner speaks of the multitude of witches\r\nwho were daily convicted through torture;[1802] and that this was no\r\nmere form of speech is evident when one judge, in a treatise on the\r\nsubject, boasted of his zeal and experience in having dispatched within\r\nhis single district nine hundred wretches in the space of fifteen\r\nyears, and another trustworthy authority relates with pride that in\r\nthe diocese of Como alone as many as a thousand had been burnt in a\r\ntwelvemonth, while the annual average was over a hundred.[1803]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWere it not for the steady patronage bestowed on the system by the\r\nChurch, it would seem strange that torture should invade the quiet\r\nand holy retirement of the cloister. Its use, however, in monasteries\r\nwas, if possible, even more arbitrary than in secular tribunals. Monks\r\nand nuns were exempt from the jurisdiction of the civil authorities,\r\nand were bound by vows of blind obedience to their superiors. The\r\nhead of each convent thus was an autocrat, and when investigating the\r\ndelinquencies of any of his flock he was subjected to no limitations.\r\nNot only could he order the accused to be tortured at will, but the\r\nwitnesses, whether male or female, were liable to the same treatment,\r\nwith the exception that in the case of nuns it was recommended that\r\nthe tortures employed should not be indecent or too severe for the\r\nfragility of the sex. As elsewhere, it was customary to commence the\r\ntorment with the weakest of the witnesses or criminals.[1804]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND THE NORTHERN RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this long history of legalized cruelty and wrong the races of\r\nnorthern Europe are mostly exceptional. Yet it is somewhat remarkable\r\nthat the first regular mediæval code in which torture is admitted as\r\na means of investigation is the one of all others in which it would\r\nbe least expected. The earliest extant law of Iceland, the Grágás,\r\nwhich dates from 1119, has one or two indications of its existence\r\nwhich are interesting as being purely autochthonic and in no sense\r\nderivable, as in the rest of Europe, from the Roman law. The character\r\nof the people, indeed, and of their institutions would seem to be\r\npeculiarly incompatible with the use of torture, for almost all cases\r\nwere submitted to inquests or juries of the vicinage, and, when this\r\nwas unsuitable, resort was had to the ordeal. The indigenous origin of\r\nthe custom, however, is shown by the fact that while it was used in\r\nbut few matters, the most prominent class subjected to it was that of\r\npregnant women, who have elsewhere been spared by the common consent\r\nof even the most pitiless legislators. An unmarried woman with child,\r\nwho refused to name her seducer, could be forced to do so by moderate\r\ntorments which should not break or discolor the skin.[1805] The object\r\nof this was to enable the family to obtain the fine from the seducer,\r\nand to save themselves from the expense of supporting the child.\r\nWhen the mother confessed, however, additional evidence was required\r\nto convict the putative father. When the inhabitants of a district,\r\nalso, refused to deliver up a man claimed as an outlaw by another\r\ndistrict, they were bound to torture him to ascertain the truth of the\r\ncharge[1806]—a provision doubtless explicable by the important part\r\noccupied by outlawry in all the schemes of Scandinavian legislation.\r\nThese are the only instances in which it is permitted, while its\r\noccasional abuse is shown by a section providing punishment for its\r\nillegal employment.[1807] Slaves, moreover, under the Icelandic, as\r\nunder other codes, had no protection at law, and were at the mercy\r\nof their masters.[1808] These few indications of the liability of\r\nfreemen, however, disappear about the time when the rest of Europe was\r\ncommencing to adopt the use of torture. In the _Jarnsida_, or code\r\ncompiled for Iceland by Hako Hakonsen of Norway, in 1258, there is no\r\nallusion whatever to its use.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian nations, as a whole, did not admit torture into their\r\nsystems of jurisprudence. The institution of the jury in various forms\r\nwas common to all, and where proof upon open trial was deficient,\r\nthey allowed, until a comparatively recent date, the accused to\r\nclear himself by sacramental purgation. Thus, in the Danish laws of\r\nWaldemar II., to which the date of 1240 is generally assigned, there\r\nis a species of permanent jury, _sandemend_, as well as a temporary\r\none, _nefninge_, and torture seems to have formed no part of judicial\r\nproceedings.[1809] This code was in force until 1683, when that of\r\nChristiern V. was promulgated. It is probable that the employment\r\nof torture may have crept in from Germany, without being regularly\r\nsanctioned, for we find Christiern forbidding its use except in cases\r\nof high treason, where the magnitude of the offence seems to him to\r\njustify the infraction of the general rule. He, however, encouraged\r\none of its greatest abuses in permitting it on criminals condemned to\r\ndeath.[1810]\r\n\r\nAmong the kindred Frisians the tendency was the same. Their code of\r\n1323 is a faithful transcript of the primitive Barbarian jurisprudence.\r\nIt contains no allusions to torture, and as all crimes, except theft,\r\nwere still compounded for with _wer-gilds_, it may reasonably be\r\nassumed that the extortion of confession was not recognized as a\r\njudicial expedient.[1811]\r\n\r\nSo, in Sweden, the code of Raguald, compiled in 1441, and in force\r\nuntil 1614, during a period in which torture flourished in almost every\r\nEuropean state, has no place for it. Trials are conducted before twelve\r\n_nempdarii_, or jurymen, and in doubtful cases the accused is directed\r\nto clear himself by oath or by conjurators. For atrocious crimes the\r\npunishments are severe, such as the wheel or the stake, but inflictions\r\nlike these are reserved for the condemned.[1812] Into these distant\r\nregions the Roman jurisprudence penetrated slowly, and the jury trial\r\nwas an elastic institution which adapted itself to all cases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the same causes may be attributed the absence of torture from the\r\nCommon Law of England. In common with the other Barbarian races,\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons solved all doubtful questions by the ordeal and\r\nwager of law, and in the collection known as the laws of Henry I. a\r\nprinciple is laid down which is incompatible with the whole theory of\r\ntorture, whether used to extract confession or evidence. A confession\r\nobtained by fear or fraud is pronounced invalid, and no one who has\r\nconfessed his own crime is to be believed with respect to that of\r\nanother.[1813] Such a principle, combined with the gradual growth of\r\nthe trial by jury, doubtless preserved the law from the contamination\r\nof inquisitorial procedure, though, as we have seen, torture was\r\nextensively employed for purposes of extortion by marauders and\r\nlawless nobles during periods of civil commotion. Glanville makes no\r\nallusion to it, and though Bracton shows a wide acquaintance with the\r\nrevived Roman jurisprudence, and makes extensive use of it in all\r\nmatters where it could be advantageously harmonized with existing\r\ninstitutions, he is careful to abstain from introducing torture into\r\ncriminal procedure.[1814] A clause in Magna Charta, indeed, has been\r\nheld by high authority to inhibit the employment of torture, but it\r\nhas no direct allusion to the subject, which was not a living question\r\nat the time, and was probably not thought of by any of the parties to\r\nthat transaction.[1815] In fact, the whole spirit of English law was\r\nirreconcilable with the fundamental principles of the inquisitorial\r\nprocess. When the accused was brought before court, he was, it is\r\ntrue, required to appear ungirdled, without boots, or cap, or cloak,\r\nto show his humility, but it is expressly directed that he shall not\r\nbe chained, lest his fetters should embarrass his self-possession in\r\nhis defence, and he was not to be forced in any way to state anything\r\nbut of his own free will.[1816] Men who could frame legal maxims so\r\nhonorable to their sense of justice and so far in advance of the\r\nreceived notions of their age could evidently have nothing in common\r\nwith the principles which placed the main reliance of the law on\r\nconfession to be wrung from the lips of an unfortunate wretch who was\r\nsystematically deprived of all support and assistance. To do so, in\r\nfact, is classed with homicide, by a legal writer of the period;[1817]\r\nbut that it was occasionally practised is shown by his giving a form\r\nfor the appeal of homicide against judges guilty of it.[1818]\r\n\r\nUnder the common law, therefore, torture had properly no existence\r\nin England, and in spite of occasional efforts on the part of the\r\nPlantagenets[1819] the character of the national institutions kept at\r\nbay the absorbing and centralizing influences of the Roman law.[1820]\r\nYet their wide acceptance in France, and their attractiveness to those\r\nwho desired to wield absolute authority, gradually accustomed the crown\r\nand the crown lawyers to the idea that torture could be administered\r\nby order of the sovereign. Sir John Fortescue, who was Lord Chancellor\r\nunder Henry VI., inveighs at great length against the French law for\r\nits cruel procedures, and with much satisfaction contrasts it with\r\nthe English practice,[1821] and yet he does not deny that torture was\r\noccasionally used in England. Indeed, his fervent arguments against\r\nthe system, addressed to Prince Edward, indicate an anxiety to combat\r\nand resist the spread of civil law doctrines on the subject, which\r\ndoubtless were favored by the influence of Margaret of Anjou. An\r\ninstance of its application in 1468 has, in fact, been recorded,\r\nwhich resulted in the execution of Sir Thomas Coke, Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon;[1822] and in 1485, Innocent VIII. remonstrated with Henry VII.\r\nrespecting some proceedings against ecclesiastics who were scourged,\r\ntortured, and hanged.[1823]\r\n\r\nUnder Henry VIII. and his children, the power of the crown was largely\r\nextended, and the doctrine became fashionable that, though under the\r\nlaw no one could be tortured for confession or evidence, yet outside\r\nand above the law the royal prerogative was supreme, and that a\r\nwarrant from the King in Privy Council fully justified the use of the\r\nrack and the introduction of the secret inquisitorial process, with\r\nall its attendant cruelty and injustice. It is difficult to conceive\r\nthe subserviency which could reconcile men, bred in the open and\r\nmanly justice of the common law, to a system so subversive of all the\r\nprinciples in which they had been trained. Yet the loftiest names of\r\nthe profession were concerned in transactions which they knew to be in\r\ncontravention of the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Smith, one of the ornaments of the Elizabethan bar,\r\ncondemned the practice as not only illegal, but illogical. “Torment or\r\nquestion, which is used by order of the civile law and custome of other\r\ncountries, ... is not used in England.... The nature of Englishmen is\r\nto neglect death, to abide no torment; and therefore hee will confesse\r\nrather to have done anything, yea, to have killed his owne father,\r\nthan to suffer torment.” And yet, a few years later, we find the same\r\nSir Thomas writing to Lord Burghley, in 1571, respecting two miserable\r\nwretches whom he was engaged in racking under a warrant from Queen\r\nElizabeth.[1824]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, Sir Edward Coke, in his Institutes, declares—“So, as\r\nthere is no law to warrant tortures in this land, nor can they be\r\njustified by any prescription, being so lately brought in.” Yet, in\r\n1603, there is a warrant addressed to Coke and Fleming, as Attorney and\r\nSolicitor General, directing them to apply torture to a servant of Lord\r\nHundsdon, who had been guilty of some idle speeches respecting King\r\nJames, and the resultant confession is in Coke’s handwriting, showing\r\nthat he personally superintended the examination.[1825]\r\n\r\nCoke’s great rival, Lord Bacon, was as subservient as his\r\ncontemporaries. In 1619, while Chancellor, we find him writing to\r\nKing James concerning a prisoner confined in the Tower on suspicion\r\nof treason—“If it may not be done otherwise, it is fit Peacock be\r\nput to torture. He deserveth it as well as Peacham did”—Peacham\r\nbeing an unfortunate parson in whose desk was found a MS. sermon,\r\nnever preached, containing some unpalatable reflections on the royal\r\nprerogative, which the prerogative resented by putting him on the\r\nrack.[1826]\r\n\r\nAs in other countries, so in England, when torture was once introduced,\r\nit rapidly broke the bounds which the prudence of the Roman lawgivers\r\nhad established for it. Treason was a most elastic crime, as was shown\r\nin 1553 by its serving as an excuse for the torture of one Stonyng,\r\na prisoner in the Marshalsea, because he had transcribed for the\r\namusement of his fellow-captives a satirical description of Philip II.,\r\nwhose marriage with Queen Mary was then under contemplation.[1827] But\r\nit was not only in cases of high treason that the royal prerogative\r\nwas allowed to transgress the limits of the law. Matters of religion,\r\nindeed, in those times of perennial change, when dynasties depended\r\non dogmas, might come under the comprehensive head of constructive\r\ntreason, and be considered to justify the torture even of women, as\r\nin the instance of Ann Askew in 1546;[1828] and of monks guilty of\r\nno other crime than the endeavor to preserve their monasteries by\r\npretended miracles.[1829] Under Elizabeth, engaged in a death-struggle\r\nwith Rome, matters became even worse, and torture was habitually used\r\non the unhappy Catholics who were thrown into the Tower. As the whole\r\nmatter was without the color of law, all legal limitations seem to\r\nhave been disregarded. The Jesuit Campion was subjected to the rack no\r\nless than three times with extreme severity, and in the intervals was\r\nmade to dispute with Protestant divines.[1830] Having once thus secured\r\nits introduction in state trials for treason, the custom inevitably\r\ntended to spread to the sphere of the most ordinary criminal business.\r\nSuspicion of theft, murder, horse-stealing, embezzlement, and other\r\nsimilar offences was sufficient to consign the unfortunate accused to\r\nthe tender mercies of the rack, the Scavenger’s Daughter,[1831] and the\r\nmanacles, when the aggrieved person had influence enough to procure\r\na royal warrant; nor were these proceedings confined to the secret\r\ndungeons of the Tower, for the records show that torture began to be\r\nhabitually applied in the Bridewell. Jardine, however, states that this\r\nespecially dangerous extension of the abuse appears to have ceased\r\nwith the death of Elizabeth, and that no trace of the torture even of\r\npolitical prisoners can be found later than the year 1640.[1832] The\r\nroyal prerogative had begun to be too severely questioned to render\r\nsuch manifestations of it prudent, and the Great Rebellion finally\r\nsettled the constitutional rights of the subject on too secure a basis\r\nfor even the time-serving statesmen of the Restoration to venture on\r\na renewal of the former practice. Yet how nearly, at one time, it\r\nhad come to be engrafted on the law of the land is evident from its\r\nbeing sufficiently recognized as a legal procedure for persons of\r\nnoble blood to claim immunity from it, and for the judges to admit\r\nthat claim as a special privilege. In the Countess of Shrewsbury’s\r\ncase, the judges, among whom was Sir Edward Coke, declared that there\r\nwas a “privilege which the law gives for the honor and reverence of\r\nthe nobility, that their bodies are not subject to torture _in causa\r\ncriminis læsæ majestatis_,” and no instance is on record to disprove\r\nthe assertion.[1833]\r\n\r\nIn one class of offences, however, torture was frequently used to a\r\nlater date, and without requiring the royal intervention. As on the\r\nContinent, sorcery and witchcraft were regarded as crimes of such\r\npeculiar atrocity, and the dread they excited was so universal and\r\nintense, that those accused of them were practically placed beyond\r\nthe pale of the law, and no means were considered too severe to\r\nsecure the conviction which in many cases could only be obtained by\r\nconfession. We have seen that among the refinements of Italian torture,\r\nthe deprivation of sleep for forty hours was considered by the most\r\nexperienced authorities on the subject to be second to none in severity\r\nand effectiveness. It neither lacerated the flesh, dislocated the\r\njoints, nor broke the bones, and yet few things could be conceived as\r\nmore likely to cloud the intellect, break down the will, and reduce\r\nthe prisoner into a frame of mind in which he would be ready to admit\r\nanything that the questions of his examiners might suggest to him.\r\nIn English witch-trials, this method of torture was not infrequently\r\nresorted to, without the limitation of time to which it was restricted\r\nby the more experienced jurists of Italy.[1834]\r\n\r\nAnother form of torture used in Great Britain, which doubtless proved\r\nexceedingly efficacious, was the “pricking” adopted to discover the\r\ninsensible spot, which, according to popular belief, was one of the\r\ninvariable signs of a witch. There were even professional “prickers”\r\nwho were called in as experts in the witch-trials, and who thrust long\r\npins into the body of the accused until some result, either negative or\r\npositive, was obtained.[1835] Thus at the prosecution of Janet Barker,\r\nin Edinburgh, in 1643, it is recorded that “she had the usual mark on\r\nthe left shoulder, which enabled one James Scober, a skilful pricker\r\nof witches, to find her out by putting a large pin into it, which she\r\nnever felt.”[1836] One witch pricker, named Kincaid, used to strip his\r\nvictims, bind them hand and foot, and then thrust his pins into every\r\npart of their bodies, until, exhausted and rendered speechless by the\r\ntorture, they failed to scream, when he would triumphantly proclaim\r\nthat he had found the witch-mark. Another pricker confessed on the\r\ngallows that he had illegally caused the death of a hundred and twenty\r\nwomen whom he had thus pricked for witchcraft.[1837]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, torture, as a regular form of judicial investigation,\r\nwas of late introduction. In the various codes collected by Skene,\r\nextending from an early period to the commencement of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, there is no allusion whatever to it. In the last of these\r\ncodes, adopted under Robert III. by the Parliament of Scotland in\r\n1400, the provisions respecting the wager of battle show that torture\r\nwould have been superfluous as a means of supplementing deficient\r\nevidence.[1838] The influence of the Roman law, however, though late in\r\nappearing, was eventually much more deeply felt in Scotland than in the\r\nsister kingdom, and consequently torture at length came to be regarded\r\nas an ordinary resource in doubtful cases. In the witch persecutions,\r\nespecially, which in Scotland rivalled the worst excesses of the\r\nInquisition of Italy and Spain, it was carried to a pitch of frightful\r\ncruelty which far transcended the limits assigned to it elsewhere.\r\nThus the vigils, which we have seen consisted simply in keeping the\r\naccused awake for forty hours by the simplest modes, in Scotland were\r\nfearfully aggravated by a witch-bridle, a band of iron fastened around\r\nthe face, with four diverging points thrust into the mouth. With this\r\nthe accused was secured immovably to a wall, and cases are on record in\r\nwhich this insupportable torment was prolonged for five and even for\r\nnine days. In other cases an enormous weight of iron hoops and chains,\r\namounting to twenty-five or thirty stone, would be accumulated on the\r\nbody of the patient.[1839] Indeed, it is difficult to believe that\r\nthe accounts which have been preserved to us of these terrible scenes\r\nare not exaggerated. No cruelty is too great for the conscientious\r\npersecutor who believes that he is avenging his God, but the limitless\r\ncapacity of human nature for inflicting is not complemented by a\r\nlimitless capacity of endurance on the part of the victim; and well\r\nauthenticated as the accounts of the Scottish witch-trials may be, they\r\nseem to transcend the possibility of human strength.[1840] In another\r\nrespect these witch-trials were marked with a peculiar atrocity.\r\nElsewhere, as we have seen, confession was requisite for condemnation,\r\nthus affording some color of excuse for torture. In Scotland, however,\r\nthe testimony of the pricker was sufficient, and torture thus became a\r\nwanton and cruel surplusage, rendered the less defensible in that the\r\npoor wretch who yielded to the torment and confessed was rewarded by\r\nbeing mercifully strangled before being burnt, while those who held out\r\nunder torture were condemned and burnt alive.[1841]\r\n\r\nTorture thus maintained its place in the laws of Scotland as long as\r\nthe kingdom preserved the right of self-legislation, though an attempt\r\nseems to have been made to repress it during the temporary union with\r\nEngland under the Commonwealth. In 1652, when the English Commissioners\r\nfor the administration of justice sat in Edinburgh, among other\r\ncriminals brought before them were two witches who had confessed their\r\nguilt before the Kirk. They were the remains of a party of six, four of\r\nwhom had died under the tortures employed to procure confession—such as\r\nhanging by the thumbs tied behind the back, scourging, burning the feet\r\nand head and putting lighted candles into their mouths, clothing them\r\nin hair-cloth soaked in vinegar “to fetch off the skin,” &c. Another\r\nwoman was stripped naked, laid on a cold stone with a hair-cloth over\r\nher, and thus kept for twenty-eight days and nights, being fed on bread\r\nand water. The diarist who records this adds that “The judges are\r\nresolved to inquire into the business, and have appointed the sheriff,\r\nministers, and tormentors to be found out, and to have an account of\r\nthe ground of this cruelty.”[1842] What result their humane efforts\r\nobtained in this particular instance I have not been able to ascertain,\r\nbut the legal administration of torture was not abolished until after\r\nthe Union, when, in 1709, the United Parliament made haste, at its\r\nsecond session, to pass an act for “improving the Union,” by which it\r\nwas done away with.[1843] Yet the spirit which had led to its abuse\r\ncould not be repressed by Act of Parliament, and a case is on record,\r\noccurring in 1722, when a poor old woman in her dotage, condemned to\r\nbe burnt as a witch, actually warmed her withered hands at the stake\r\nlighted for her destruction, and mumbled out her gladness at enjoying\r\nthe unaccustomed warmth.[1844]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE TORTURE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA system of procedure which entailed results so deplorable as those\r\nwhich we have seen accompany it everywhere, could scarcely fail to\r\narouse the opposition of thinking men who were not swayed by reverence\r\nfor precedent or carried away by popular impulses. Accordingly, an\r\noccasional voice was raised in denunciation of the use of torture.\r\nGeiler von Kaisersberg, the most popular preacher of his time in\r\nGermany, who died in 1510, endeavored to procure its disuse, as well\r\nas to mitigate the cruelties practised upon prisoners.[1845] The\r\nSpaniard, Juan Luis Vives, one of the profoundest scholars of the\r\nsixteenth century, condemned it as useless and inhuman.[1846] The\r\nsceptic of the period, Montaigne, was too cool and clear-headed not to\r\nappreciate the vicious principle on which it was based, and he did not\r\nhesitate to stamp it with his reprobation. “To tell the truth, it is a\r\nmeans full of uncertainty and danger; what would we not say, what would\r\nwe not do to escape suffering so poignant? whence it happens that when\r\na judge tortures a prisoner for the purpose of not putting an innocent\r\nman to death, he puts him to death both innocent and tortured....\r\nAre you not unjust when, to save him from being killed, you do worse\r\nthan kill him?”[1847] In 1624, the learned Johann Gräfe, in his\r\n_Tribunal Reformatum_, argued forcibly in favor of its abolition,\r\nhaving had, it is said, practical experience of its horrors during\r\nhis persecution for Arminianism by the Calvinists of Holland, and his\r\nbook attracted sufficient attention to be repeatedly reprinted.[1848]\r\nFriedrich Keller, in 1657, at the University of Strassburg, presented\r\na well-reasoned thesis urging its disuse, which was reprinted in 1688,\r\nalthough the title which he prefixed to it shows that he scarce dared\r\nto assume the responsibility for its unpopular doctrines.[1849] When\r\nthe French Ordonnance of 1670 was in preparation, various magistrates\r\nof the highest character and largest experience gave it as their fixed\r\nopinion that torture was useless, that it rarely succeeded in eliciting\r\nthe truth from the accused, and that it ought to be abolished.[1850]\r\nTowards the close of the century, various writers took up the question.\r\nThe best known of these was perhaps Augustin Nicolas, who has been\r\nfrequently referred to above, and who argued with more zeal and\r\nlearning than skill against the whole system, but especially against it\r\nas applied in cases of witchcraft.[1851] In 1692, von Boden, in a work\r\nalluded to in the preceding pages, inveighed against its abuses, while\r\nadmitting its utility in many classes of crimes. Bayle, not long after,\r\nin his Dictionary, condemned it in his usual indirect and suggestive\r\nmanner.[1852] In 1705, at the University of Halle, Martin Bernhardi\r\nof Pomerania, a candidate for the doctorate, in his inaugural thesis,\r\nargued with much vigor in favor of abolishing it, and the dean of the\r\nfaculty, Christian Thomas, acknowledged the validity of his reasoning,\r\nthough expressing doubts as to the practicability of a sudden reform.\r\nBernhardi states that in his time it was no longer employed in\r\nHolland, and its disuse in Utrecht he attributes to a case in which a\r\nthief procured the execution, after due torture and confession, of a\r\nshoemaker, against whom he had brought a false charge in revenge for\r\nthe refusal of a pair of boots.[1853] His assertion, however, is too\r\ngeneral, for it was not until the formation of the Republic of the\r\nNetherlands, in 1798, that it was formally abolished.[1854]\r\n\r\nThese efforts had little effect, but they manifest the progress of\r\nenlightenment, and doubtless paved the way for change, especially in\r\nthe Prussian territories. Yet, in 1730, we find the learned Baron\r\nSenckenberg reproducing Zanger’s treatise, not as an archæological\r\ncuriosity, but as a practical text-book for the guidance of lawyers\r\nand judges. Meanwhile the propriety of the system continued to be\r\na subject of discussion in the schools, with ample expenditure of\r\nlearning on both sides.[1855] In 1733, at Leipzig, Moritz August Engel\r\nread a thesis, which called forth much applause, in which he undertook\r\nto defend the use of torture against the dictum of Christian Thomas\r\nnearly thirty years before.[1856] The argument employed is based on the\r\ntheory of the criminal jurisprudence of the time, in which the guilt\r\nof the accused is taken for granted and the burden thrown upon him\r\nof proving himself innocent. Engel declares that in all well-ordered\r\nStates torture is rightfully employed; those who are innocent and are\r\nthe victims of suspicious circumstances have only themselves to blame\r\nfor their imprudence, and must make allowance for the imperfections\r\nof human reason; and he airily disposes of the injustice of the\r\nsystem by declaring that the State need not care if an innocent man\r\nis occasionally tortured, for no human ordinance can be expected to\r\nbe free from occasional drawbacks. Another disputant on the same side\r\nmeets the argument that the different sensibilities of individuals\r\nrendered torture uncertain, by boasting that in the Duchy of Zerbst the\r\nexecutioner had invented an instrument which would wring a confession\r\nout of the most hardened and robust.[1857] It was shortly after this,\r\nhowever, that the process of reform began in earnest. Frederic the\r\nGreat succeeded to the throne of Prussia May 31, 1740. Few of his\r\nprojects of universal philanthropy and philosophical regeneration of\r\nhuman nature survived the hardening experiences of royal ambition,\r\nbut while his power was yet in its first bloom he made haste to get\r\nrid of this relic of unreasoning cruelty. It was almost his earliest\r\nofficial act, for the cabinet order abolishing torture is dated\r\nJune 3d.[1858] Yet even Frederic could not absolutely shake off the\r\ntraditional belief in its necessity when the safety of the State or of\r\nthe head of the State was concerned. Treason and rebellion and some\r\nother atrocious crimes were excepted from the reform; and in 1752, at\r\nthe instance of his high chancellor, Cocceji, by a special rescript,\r\nhe ordered two citizens of Oschersleben to be tortured on suspicion\r\nof robbery.[1859] With singular inconsistency, moreover, torture in a\r\nmodified form was long permitted in Prussia, not precisely as a means\r\nof investigation, but as a sort of punishment for obdurate prisoners\r\nwho would not confess, and as a means of marking them for subsequent\r\nrecognition.[1860] It is evident that the abrogation of torture did not\r\ncarry with it the removal of the evils of the inquisitorial process.\r\n\r\nWhen the royal philosopher of Europe thus halted in the reform, it is\r\nnot singular that his example did not put an end to the controversy\r\nas to the abolition of torture elsewhere. German jurisprudence, in\r\nfact, was not provided with substitutes, and legists trained in the\r\ninquisitorial process might well hesitate to abandon a system with\r\nwhich they were familiar in order to enter upon a region of untried\r\nexperiment for which there was no provision in the institutions or the\r\nancestral customs of the land. These natural doubts are well expressed\r\nby Gerstlacher, who, in 1753, published a temperate and argumentative\r\ndefence of torture. He enumerates the substitutes which had been\r\nproposed by his opponents, and if he does them no injustice, the judges\r\nof the day might naturally feel indisposed to experiments so crude and\r\nillogical. It seems that the alternatives offered for the decision of\r\ncases in which the accused could not be convicted by external evidence\r\nreduced themselves to four—to dismiss him without a sentence either\r\nof acquittal or conviction, to make him take an oath of purgation, to\r\ngive him an extraordinary (that is to say, a less) penalty than that\r\nprovided for the crime, and, lastly, to imprison him or send him to the\r\ngalleys or other hard labor, proportioned to the degree of the evidence\r\nagainst him, until he should confess.[1861]\r\n\r\nIn Saxony, as early as 1714, an Electoral Rescript had restricted\r\njurisdiction over torture to the magistrates of Leipzig, to whom\r\nall proceedings in criminal prosecutions had to be submitted for\r\nexamination prior to their confirmation of the decision of the local\r\ntribunals to employ it.[1862] This must have greatly reduced the\r\namount of wrong and suffering caused by the system, and thus modified\r\nit continued to exist until, in the remodelling of the Saxon criminal\r\nlaw, between 1770 and 1783, the whole apparatus of torture was swept\r\naway. In Austria the _Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana_, issued in\r\n1769 by Maria Theresa, still contains elaborate instructions as to the\r\nadministration of torture, with careful descriptions and illustrations\r\nof the implements in use and the methods of employing them;[1863] but\r\nthe enlightenment of Joseph II., soon after his accession in 1780, put\r\nan end to the barbarism, and in Switzerland about the same time it was\r\nsimilarly disused. In Russia, the Empress Catherine, in 1762, removed\r\nit from the jurisdiction of the inferior courts, where it had been\r\ngreatly abused; in 1767, by a secret order, it was restricted to cases\r\nin which the confession of the accused proved actually indispensable,\r\nand even in these it was only permitted under the special command\r\nof governors of provinces.[1864] In the singularly enlightened\r\ninstructions which she drew up for the framing of a new code in 1767,\r\nthe use of torture was earnestly argued against in a manner which\r\nbetrays the influence of Beccaria.[1865] Under these auspices it soon\r\nbecame almost obsolete, and it was finally abolished in 1801. Yet, in\r\nsome of the States of central Europe, the progress of enlightenment was\r\nwonderfully slow. Torture continued to disgrace the jurisprudence of\r\nWürtemberg and Bavaria until 1806 and 1807. Though the wars of Napoleon\r\nabolished it temporarily in other States, on his fall in 1814 it was\r\nactually restored. In 1819, however, George IV. consented, at the\r\nrequest of his subjects, to dispense with it in Hanover; while in Baden\r\nit continued to exist until 1831. Yet legists who had been trained in\r\nthe old school could not admit the soundness of modern ideas, and in\r\nthe greater part of Germany the theories which resulted in the use\r\nof torture continued to prevail. The secret inquisitorial process\r\nwas retained and the principle that the confession of the accused\r\nwas requisite to his condemnation. Torture of some kind is necessary\r\nto render the practical application of this system efficacious, and\r\naccordingly, though the rack and strappado were abolished, their place\r\nwas taken by other modes in reality not less cruel. When appearances\r\nwere against the prisoner, he was confined for an indefinite period\r\nand subjected to all the hard usage to be expected from officials\r\nprovoked by his criminal obstinacy. He was brought up repeatedly\r\nbefore his judge and exposed to the most searching interrogatories and\r\nterrified with threats. Legists, unwilling to abandon the powerful\r\nweapon which had placed every accused person at their mercy, imagined\r\na new justification for its revival. It was held that every criminal\r\nowed to society a full and free confession. His refusal to do this was\r\na crime, so that if his answers were unsatisfactory to the judge the\r\nlatter could punish him on the spot for contumacy. As this punishment\r\nwas usually administered with the scourge, it will be seen that the\r\nabolition of torture was illusory, and that the worst abuses to which\r\nit gave rise were carefully retained.[1866] Indeed, if we are to\r\naccept literally some letters of M. A. Eubule-Evans in the London\r\n“Times” of 1872, the _Untersuchungschaft_ or inquisitorial process as\r\nemployed in Prussia to the present day lacks little of the worst abuses\r\nrecorded by Sprenger and Bodin. The accused while under detention is\r\nsubjected to both physical and moral torture, and is carefully watched\r\nby spies. In the prison of Bruchsal there is a machine to which the\r\nprisoner is attached by leather thongs passed around head, trunk, and\r\nlimbs, and drawn so tight that the arrested circulation forces the\r\nblood from mouth and ears; or he is confined, perhaps for a week at a\r\ntime, in a small cell of which floor and sides are covered with sharp\r\nwooden wedges, rivalling the fragments of potsherds which Prudentius\r\nconsidered the crowning effort of devilish ingenuity for the torture of\r\nChristian martyrs.\r\n\r\nSpain, as may readily be imagined, was in no haste to reform the\r\nancient system of procedure. As late as 1796, in the Vice-royalty of\r\nNew Granada, when the spread of the ideas of the French Revolution\r\nbegan to infect society, some pasquinades appeared in Santafé\r\ndispleasing to the government. Though the Viceroy Ezpeleta was regarded\r\nas a singularly enlightened man, he had a number of persons arrested on\r\nsuspicion, one of whom was put to the torture to discover the author\r\nof the obnoxious epigrams. It is satisfactory to know that although\r\nseveral of the accused were convicted and sent to Spain to serve out\r\nlong terms of punishment, on their arrival at Madrid they were all\r\ndischarged and compensated.[1867] After the revolution, the authorized\r\nuse of torture was abolished, but as recently as 1879 its application,\r\nby various methods showing skill and experience in its use, on an\r\nAmerican citizen falsely accused of theft, led to a correspondence\r\nbetween the governments of Venezuela and the United States, recorded in\r\nthe journals of the time.\r\n\r\nIn the mother country the employment of torture, though becoming rarer\r\nas the eighteenth century neared its end, continued legal until the\r\noverthrow of the old monarchy, and it was not abolished until the\r\nCortes of Cadiz in 1811 revolutionized all the institutions of the\r\nnation. In the reaction which followed the return of the Bourbons it\r\nwas not reinstated, but moderated appliances known as _apremios_—which\r\nwere sometimes as severe as the rack or the pulley—continued to be\r\nused, especially in political offences, by the arbitrary despotism of\r\nthe Restoration.[1868]\r\n\r\nEven France had maintained a conservatism which may seem surprising in\r\nthat centre of the philosophic speculation of the eighteenth century.\r\nHer leading writers had not hesitated to condemn the use of torture.\r\nIn the _Esprit des Lois_, in 1748, Montesquieu stamped his reprobation\r\non the system with a quiet significance which showed that he had on\r\nhis side all the great thinkers of the age, and that he felt argument\r\nto be mere surplusage.[1869] Voltaire did not allow its absurdities\r\nand incongruities to escape. In 1765 he endeavored to arouse public\r\nopinion on the case of the Chevalier de la Barre, a youthful officer\r\nonly twenty years of age, who was tortured and executed on an\r\naccusation of having recited a song insulting to Mary Magdalen and of\r\nhaving mutilated with his sword a wooden crucifix on the bridge of\r\nAbbeville.[1870] He was more successful in attracting the attention\r\nof all Europe to the celebrated _affaire Calas_ which, in 1761, had\r\nfurnished a notable example of the useless cruelty of the system.\r\nIn that year, at midnight of Oct. 13th, at Toulouse, the body of\r\nMarc-Antoine Calas was found strangled in the back shop of his father.\r\nThe family were Protestants and the murdered man had given signs of\r\nconversion to Catholicism, in imitation of his younger brother. A\r\nminute investigation left scarcely a doubt that the murder had been\r\ncommitted by the father, from religious motives, and he was condemned\r\nto death. He appealed to the Parlement of Toulouse, which after a\r\npatient hearing sentenced him to the wheel, and to the _question\r\nordinaire et extraordinaire_, to extract a confession. He underwent\r\nthe extremity of torture and the hideous punishment of being broken\r\nalive without varying from his protestations of innocence. Though both\r\ntrials appear to have been conducted with rigorous impartiality, the\r\nProtestantism of Europe saw in the affair the evidence of religious\r\npersecution, and a fearful outcry was raised. Voltaire, ever on the\r\nwatch for means to promote toleration and freedom of thought, seized\r\nhold of it with tireless energy, and created so strong an agitation\r\non the subject that in 1764 the supreme tribunal at Paris reversed\r\nthe sentence, discharged the other members of the family, who had\r\nbeen subjected to various punishments, and rehabilitated the memory of\r\nCalas.[1871] When Louis XVI., at the opening of his reign, proposed\r\nto introduce many long-needed reforms, Voltaire took advantage of the\r\noccasion to address to him in 1777 an earnest request to include among\r\nthem the disuse of torture;[1872] yet it was not until 1780 that the\r\n_question préparatoire_ was abolished by a royal edict which, in a\r\nfew weighty lines, indicated that only the reverence for traditional\r\nusage had preserved it so long.[1873] This edict, however, was not\r\nstrictly obeyed, and cases of the use of torture still occasionally\r\noccurred, as that of Marie Tison at Rouen, in 1788, accused of the\r\nmurder of her husband, when thumb-screws were applied to both thumbs\r\nand at the same time she was hoisted in the strappado, in which she was\r\nallowed to hang for an hour after the executioner had reported that\r\nboth shoulders were out of joint, all of which was insufficient to\r\nextract a confession.[1874] There evidently was occasion for another\r\nordonnance, which in that same year, 1788, was promulgated in order\r\nto insure the observance of the previous one.[1875] In fact, when the\r\nStates-General was convened in 1879, the _cahier des doléances_ of\r\nValenciennes contained a prayer for the abolition of torture, showing\r\nthat it had not as yet been discontinued there.[1876] The _question\r\ndéfinitive_ or _préalable_, by which the prisoner after condemnation\r\nwas again tortured to discover his accomplices, still remained until\r\n1788, when it, too, was abolished, at least temporarily. It was\r\npronounced uncertain, cruel to the convict and perplexing to the judge,\r\nand, above all, dangerous to the innocent whom the prisoner might name\r\nin the extremity of his agony to procure its cessation, and whom he\r\nwould persist in accusing to preserve himself from its repetition. Yet,\r\nwith strange inconsistency, the abolition of this cruel wrong was only\r\nprovisional, and its restoration was threatened in a few years, if the\r\ntribunals should deem it necessary.[1877] When those few short years\r\ncame around they dawned on a new France, from which the old systems\r\nhad been swept away as by the besom of destruction; and torture as\r\nan element of criminal jurisprudence was a thing of the past. By the\r\ndecree of October 9th, 1789, it was abolished forever.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, Beccaria, in 1764, took occasion to devote a few pages of\r\nhis treatise on crimes and punishments to the subject of torture, and\r\nits illogical cruelty could not well be exposed with more terseness\r\nand force.[1878] It was probably due to the movement excited by this\r\nwork that in 1786 torture was formally abolished in Tuscany. In\r\nthis the enlightened Grand-duke Leopold was in advance of his time,\r\nand the despots who ruled the divided fractions of the peninsula,\r\nalthough they might be willing to banish torture from ordinary criminal\r\njurisprudence, had too well-grounded a distrust of the fidelity of\r\ntheir subjects to divest themselves of this resource in the suppression\r\nof political offences. Hardly had the Bourbons, after the overthrow\r\nof Napoleon, been reseated on the throne of the Two Sicilies when the\r\nrestless dissatisfaction of the people seemed to justify the severest\r\nmeasures for the maintenance of so-called order. The troubles of 1820\r\nled to arming the police with exceptional and summary jurisdiction,\r\nunder which it deemed itself authorized to employ any methods requisite\r\nto detect and punish conspirators. This continued until the revolution\r\nof 1848 aggravated the fears of absolutism, and from its suppression\r\nuntil the expedition of Garibaldi the régime of the Neapolitan\r\ndominions was an organized Terror. Grave as we have seen were the\r\nabuses of torture when systematized in the detection of crime, they\r\nwere outstripped by the licensed cruelty of the ex-galley slaves of\r\nthe Neapolitan police, who were restrained by no codes or rules of\r\npractice, and were eager to demonstrate their zeal by the number of\r\ntheir victims. The terrible secrets of the dungeons of Naples and\r\nPalermo may never see the light, but enough is known to show that\r\nthey rivalled those of Ezzelin da Romano. Police agents competed in\r\ninventing new and hideous modes of inflicting pain. Neither age nor\r\nsex was spared. In one case an old man and his daughter, five months\r\ngone in pregnancy, died under the lash. If a suspected man took alarm\r\nand fled, his mother or his wife and daughters would be tortured to\r\ndiscover his hiding-place. The evil records of the dark ages have\r\nnothing to show more brutal and inhuman than the application of torture\r\nin Naples and Sicily in the second half of the nineteenth century.[1879]\r\n\r\nThat the mortal duel between autocracy and Nihilism in Russia should\r\nlead to the employment of torture in unravelling the desperate\r\nconspiracies of the malcontents is so natural that we may readily\r\naccept the current assertions of the fact. The conspirators are said\r\nfrequently to carry poison in order, if arrested, to save themselves\r\nfrom endless torment and the risk of being forced to betray associates,\r\nand the friends of prisoners spare no effort to convey to them some\r\ndeadly drug by means of which they may escape the infliction. Polish\r\naspirations for liberty are repressed in the same manner, and in 1890\r\nthe journal’s recorded the case of Ladislas Guisbert, rendered insane\r\nby the prolonged administration of Marsigli’s favorite torment of\r\nsleeplessness.\r\n\r\nSo long as human nature retains its imperfections the baffled\r\nimpatience of the strong will be apt to wreak its vengeance on the\r\nweak and defenceless. As recently as 1867, in Texas, the Jefferson\r\n“Times” records a case in which, under the auspices of the military\r\nauthorities, torture was applied to two negroes suspected of purloining\r\na considerable amount of money which had been lost by a revenue\r\ncollector. More recently still, in September, 1868, the London journals\r\nreport fearful barbarities perpetrated by the Postmaster-General of\r\nRoumania to trace the authors of a mail robbery. A woman was hung to a\r\nbeam with hot eggs under the armpits; others were burned with grease\r\nand petroleum, while others again were tied by the hair to horses’\r\ntails and dragged through thorn bushes. It must be added that the\r\noffending officials were promptly dismissed and committed for trial. A\r\nstill more recent case is one which has been the subject of legislative\r\ndiscussion in Switzerland, where it appears that in the Canton of Zug,\r\nunder order of court, a man suspected of theft was put on bread and\r\nwater from Oct. 26th to Nov. 10th, 1869, to extort confession, and when\r\nthis failed he was subjected to thumb-screws and beaten with rods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn casting a retrospective glance over this long history of cruelty and\r\ninjustice, it is saddening to observe that Christian communities, where\r\nthe truths of the Gospel were received with unquestioning veneration,\r\nsystematized the administration of torture with a cold-blooded ferocity\r\nunknown to the legislation of the heathen nations whence they derived\r\nit. The careful restrictions and safeguards, with which the Roman\r\njurisprudence sought to protect the interests of the accused, contrast\r\nstrangely with the reckless disregard of every principle of justice\r\nwhich sullies the criminal procedure of Europe from the thirteenth to\r\nthe nineteenth century. From this no race or religion has been exempt.\r\nWhat the Calvinist suffered in Flanders, he inflicted in Holland; what\r\nthe Catholic enforced in Italy, he endured in England; nor did either\r\nof them deem that he was forfeiting his share in the Divine Evangel of\r\npeace on earth and goodwill to men.\r\n\r\nThe mysteries of the human conscience and of human motives are\r\nwell-nigh inscrutable, and it may seem shocking to assert that these\r\ncenturies of unmitigated wrong are indirectly traceable to that\r\nreligion of which the second great commandment was that man should\r\nlove his neighbor as himself. Yet so it was. The first commandment, to\r\nlove God with all our heart, when perverted by superstition, gave a\r\nstrange direction to the teachings of Christ. For ages, the assumptions\r\nof an infallible Church had led men to believe that the interpreter\r\nwas superior to Scripture. Every expounder of the holy text felt in\r\nhis inmost heart that he alone, with his fellows, worshipped God as\r\nGod desired to be worshipped, and that every ritual but his own was\r\nan insult to the Divine nature. Outside of his own communion there\r\nwas no escape from eternal perdition, and the fervor of religious\r\nconviction thus made persecution a duty to God and man. This led the\r\nInquisition, as we have seen, to perfect a system of which the iniquity\r\nwas complete. Thus commended, that system became part and parcel of\r\nsecular law, and when the Reformation arose the habits of thought which\r\nages had consolidated were universal. The boldest Reformers who shook\r\noff the yoke of Rome, as soon as they had attained power, had as little\r\nscruple as Rome itself in rendering obligatory their interpretation\r\nof divine truth, and in applying to secular as well as to religious\r\naffairs the cruel maxims in which they had been educated.\r\n\r\nYet, in the general enlightenment which caused and accompanied the\r\nReformation, there passed away gradually the passions which had\r\ncreated the rigid institutions of the Middle Ages. Those institutions\r\nhad fulfilled their mission, and the savage tribes that had broken\r\ndown the worn-out civilization of Rome were at last becoming fitted\r\nfor a higher civilization than the world had yet seen, wherein the\r\nprecepts of the Gospel might at length find practical expression and\r\nrealization. For the first time in the history of man the universal\r\nlove and charity which lie at the foundation of Christianity are\r\nrecognized as the elements on which human society should be based.\r\nWeak and erring as we are, and still far distant from the ideal of\r\nthe Saviour, yet are we approaching it, even if our steps are painful\r\nand hesitating. In the slow evolution of the centuries, it is only by\r\ncomparing distant periods that we can mark our progress; but progress\r\nnevertheless exists, and future generations, perhaps, may be able to\r\nemancipate themselves wholly from the cruel and arbitrary domination of\r\nsuperstition and force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aames II., story of,

XII. ii. The _jusjurandum necessarium_ could always be\r\nadministered by the judge in cases of deficient evidence, and the\r\n_jusjurandum in jure_ proffered by the plaintiff to the defendant was\r\nconclusive: “Manifestæ turpitudinis et confessionis est nolle nec\r\njurare nec jusjurandum referre”—Ibid. l. 38.\r\n\r\n[29] Ll.

PP. II. Epist. XIV. ad Bonifacium. Cf. Hincmari\r\nRemens. Epist. XXII.\r\n\r\n[33] Thus Alfonso the Wise endeavored to introduce into Spain the\r\nmutual challenging of the parties involved in the Roman _jusjurandum\r\nin jure_, by his _jura de juicio_ (Las Siete Partidas, P. III. Tit.\r\nxi. l. 2. Cf. Espéculo, Lib. V. Tit. xi. ley 2). Oddly enough, the\r\nsame procedure is found incorporated in the municipal law of Rheims\r\nin the fourteenth century, probably introduced by some over-zealous\r\ncivilian; “Si alicui deferatur jusjurandum, necesse habet jurare vel\r\nreferre jusjurandum, et hoc super quovis debito, vel inter quasvis\r\npersonas”—Lib. Pract. de Consuetud. Remens. § 15 (Archives Législat. de\r\nReims, P. I. p. 37). By this time, however, the oaths of parties had\r\nassumed great importance. In the legislation of St. Louis, they occupy\r\na position which was a direct incentive to perjury. Thus he provides\r\nfor the hanging of the owner of a beast which had killed a man, if\r\nhe was foolish enough not to swear that he was ignorant of its being\r\nvicious. “Et si il estoit si fox que il deist que il seust la teche de\r\nla beste, il en seroit pendus pour la recoignoissance”—Établissements,\r\nLiv. I. chap. cxxi.\r\n\r\nA charter granted to the commune of Lorris, in 1155, by Louis le\r\nJeune, gives to burghers the privilege of rebutting by oath, without\r\nconjurators, an accusation unsupported by testimony—Chart. Ludovic.\r\njunior. ann. 1155, cap. xxxii. (Isambert, Anciennes Lois Françaises\r\nI. 157.) And, in comparatively modern times, in Germany, the same\r\nrule was followed. “Juramento rei, quod purgationis vocatur, sæpe\r\netiam innocentia, utpote quæ in anima constitit, probatur et indicia\r\ndiluuntur;” and this oath was administered when the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to justify torture. (Zangeri Tract. de Quæstionibus, cap.\r\niii. No. 46.) In 1592, Zanger wrote an elaborate essay to prove the\r\nevils of the custom.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact, however, that of all the medieval codes the\r\none least affected by the influence of the Roman law was the Saxon,\r\nand in this the purgatorial power of the oath was admitted to a degree\r\nunknown elsewhere. The accused was allowed in certain cases to clear\r\nhimself, however notorious were the facts, and no evidence was admitted\r\nto disprove his position, unless it were a question of theft, and the\r\nstolen articles were found in his possession, or he had suffered a\r\nprevious conviction. (Jur. Provin. Saxon. Lib. I. Art. 15, 18, 39; Lib.\r\nII. Art. 4, 72.) Even this was an improvement on the previous custom,\r\nif we may believe Cardinal Henry of Susa, who denounces the practice in\r\nSaxony and Dacia, where a man can clear himself, even if he holds the\r\nstolen article in his hand and the loser has ample witnesses present\r\n(Hostiensis Aureæ Summæ Lib. V. De Purg. canon. § 3). This irrational\r\nabuse was long in vogue, and was denounced by the council of Bâle in\r\nthe fifteenth century (Schilter. Thesaur. II. 291). It only prevailed\r\nin the north of Germany; the Jus Provin. Alaman. (cap. ccclxxxi. §\r\n3), which regulated Southern Germany, alludes to it as one of the\r\ndistinguishing features of the Saxon code.\r\n\r\nSo, also, at the same period a special privilege was claimed by the\r\ninhabitants of Franconia, in virtue of which a murderer was allowed to\r\nrebut with his single oath all testimony as to his guilt, unless he\r\nchanced to be caught with the red hand—Jur. Provin. Alaman. cap. cvi. §\r\n7.\r\n\r\n[34] “Ego solus jurare volo, tu, si audes, nega sacramentum meum et\r\narmis mecum contende.”—Ll. Ripuar. Tit.

Notwithstanding the laxity of these\r\ndoctrines, it is not to be supposed that the true theory of the oath\r\nwas altogether lost. St. Isidor of Seville, who was but little anterior\r\nto Theodore of Canterbury, well expresses it (Sententt. Lib. II.\r\ncap. xxxi. § 8): “Quacunque arte verborum quisque juret, Deus tamen,\r\nqui conscientiæ testis est, ita hoc accipit, sicut ille cui juratur\r\nintelligit,” and this, being adopted in successive collections of\r\ncanons, coexisted with the above as a maxim of ecclesiastical law\r\n(Ivon.

Lib. i. cap. 28), whose\r\nwork is rather legendary in its character, describes the Pope as\r\nswearing to his innocence by his share at the day of judgment in the\r\npromises of the gospels, which he had placed upon his head.\r\n\r\n[72] Capit. Aquisgran. ann. 803, cap. vii.\r\n\r\n[73] Bonifacii Epist. cxxvi.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the oaths of priests was one of considerable perplexity\r\nduring the dark ages. Among the numerous privileges assumed by the\r\nsacerdotal body was exemption from the necessity of swearing, an\r\nexemption which had the justification of the ancient Roman custom;\r\n“Sacerdotem, Vestalem, et Flaminem Dialem in omni mea jurisdictione\r\njurare non cogam” (Edict. Perpet. ap. Aul. Gell. x. 15). The effort\r\nto obtain the reversion of this privilege dates from an early period,\r\nand was sometimes allowed and sometimes rejected by the secular\r\nauthorities, both as respects promissory, judicial, and exculpatory\r\noaths. The struggle between church and state on this subject is well\r\nexemplified in a case which occurred in 1269. The Archbishop of Reims\r\nsued a burgher of Chaudardre. When each party had to take the oath,\r\nthe prelate demanded that his should be taken by his attorney. The\r\ndefendant demurred to this, alleging that the archbishop had in person\r\npresented the complaint. Appeal was made to the Parlement of Paris,\r\nwhich decided that the defendant’s logic was correct, and that the\r\npersonal oath of the prelate was requisite (Olim, I. 765).\r\n\r\nIn Spain, a bishop appearing in a secular court, either as plaintiff or\r\ndefendant, was not exempt from the oath, but had the singular privilege\r\nof not being compelled to touch the gospels on which he swore.—Siete\r\nPartidas, P.

The Roman law exercised great discrimination in\r\nadmitting the evidence of a relative to either party in an action\r\n(Pauli Sentent. Lib. V. Tit. xv.—Ll. 4, 5, 6, 9. Dig. XXII. v.). The\r\nWisigoths not only adopted this principle, but carried it so far as to\r\nexclude the evidence of a kinsman in a cause between his relative and\r\na stranger (L. Wisigoth. Lib. II. Tit. iv. c. 12), which was adopted\r\ninto the Carlovingian legislation (Benedict. Levit. Capitul. Lib. VI.\r\nc. 348) under the strong Romanizing influence which then prevailed. The\r\nrule, once established, retained its place through the vicissitudes\r\nof the feudal and customary law (Beaumanoir, Coutumes du Beauvoisis,\r\ncap. xxxix. § 38.—Cout. de Bretagne, Tit. vii. art. 161, 162).

XLV.), and both\r\nChildebert and Clotair II., in edicts promulgated near the close of the\r\nsixth century, hold the hundreds or townships responsible for robberies\r\ncommitted within their limits (Decret. Childeberti ann. 595, c. 10;\r\nDecret. Chlotarii II. c. 1).\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that, as among all the barbarian races, the family\r\nwas liable for the misdeeds of its members, so the tribe or clan of\r\nthe offender was held responsible when the offence was committed upon\r\na member of another tribe, and such edicts as those of Childebert and\r\nClotair were merely adaptations of the rule to the existing condition\r\nof society. The most perfect early code that has reached us, that of\r\nthe ancient Irish, expresses in detail the responsibility of each sept\r\nfor the actions not only of its members, but of those also who were\r\nin any way connected with it. “And because the four nearest tribes\r\nbear the crime of each kinsman of their stock.... And because there\r\nare four who have an interest in every one who sues and is sued: the\r\ntribe of the father, the chief, the church, the tribe of the mother\r\nor foster-father.... Every tribe is liable after the absconding\r\nof a member of it, after notice, after warning, and after lawful\r\nwaiting.”—Senchus Mor, I. 263-5.\r\n\r\n[93] See Mr. Pike’s very interesting “History of Crime in England,”\r\nVol. I. pp. 61-2.

The _twelfhendeman_ meant a thane\r\n(Twelfhindus est homo plene nobilis i. Thainus.—Leg. Henrici I. Tit.\r\nlxxvi. § 4), whose price was 1200 solidi. So thoroughly did the\r\nstructure of jurisprudence depend upon the system of _wer-gild_ or\r\ncomposition, that the various classes of society were named according\r\nto the value of their heads. Thus the villein or _cherleman_ was also\r\ncalled _twyhindus_ or _twyhindeman_, his _wer-gild_ being 200 solidi;\r\nthe _radcnicht_ (road-knight, or mounted follower) was a _sexhendeman_;\r\nand the comparative judicial weight of their oaths followed a similar\r\nscale of valuation, which was in force even subsequently to the\r\nConquest (Leg.

In his vero causis sacramenta præstentur in quibus nullam\r\nprobationem discussio judicantis invenerit” (L. Baioar. Tit. VIII. c.\r\n16). In a Capitulary of Louis le Débonnaire—“Si hujus facti testes\r\nnon habuerit cum duodecim conjuratoribus legitimis per sacramentum\r\nadfirmet” (Capit. Ludov. Pii ann. 819, § 1). In one of the Emperor\r\nLothair—“Si testes habere non poterit, concedimus ut cum XII.\r\njuratoribus juret” (L. Longobard. Lib. I. Tit. IX. § 37). So Louis II.,\r\nin 854, ordered that a man accused of harboring robbers, if taken in\r\nthe act, was to be immediately punished; but if merely cited on popular\r\nrumor, he was at liberty to clear himself with twelve compurgators\r\n(Recess. Ticinen. Tit. II. cap. 3).\r\n\r\nIt was the same in subsequent periods. The Scottish law of the\r\nthirteenth century alludes to the absence of testimony as a necessary\r\npreliminary, but when an acquittal was once obtained in this manner the\r\naccused seems to have been free from all subsequent proceedings, when\r\ninconvenient witnesses might perhaps turn up—“Et si hoc modo purgatus\r\nfuerit, absolvetur a petitione Regis in posterum” (Regiam Majestatem,\r\nLib. IV. c. 21). So, in the laws of Nieuport, granted by Philip of\r\nAlsace, Count of Flanders, in 1163 “Et si hoc scabini vel opidani non\r\ncognoverint, conquerens cum juramento querelam suam sequetur, et alter\r\nse excusabit juramento quinque hominum” (Leg. secundæ Noviportus). See\r\nalso the Consuetud. Tornacens. ann. 1187, §§ ii. iii. xvi., where two\r\nconjurators release a defendant from a claim of debt unsupported by\r\nevidence. In case of assault, “si constans non fuerit,” two conjurators\r\nclear the accused; in case of wounding, six are required if the affair\r\noccurred by daylight; if at night, the cold water ordeal is prescribed\r\n(D’Achery, Spicileg. III. 551-2). The legislation of Norway and Iceland\r\nin the next century is even more positive “Iis tantum concessis quæ\r\nlegum codices sanciunt, juramenta nempe purgatoria et accusatoria, ubi\r\nlegitimi defuerint testes” (Jarnsida, Mannhelge, cap. xxxvii.).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an exception to this general principle is apparently\r\nfound in a constitution of the Emperor Henry III., issued about the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century “Si quem ex his dominus suus accusaverit\r\nde quacunque re, licet illi juramento se cum suis coæqualibus\r\nabsolvere, exceptis tribus: hoc est si in vitam domini sui, aut in\r\ncameram ejus consilium habuisse arguitur, aut in munitiones ejus.\r\nCæteris vero hominibus de quacunque objectione, absque advocato, cum\r\nsuis coæqualibus juramento se poterit absolvere” (Goldast. Constit.\r\nImp. I. 231).\r\n\r\nIn a constitution of Frederic II. in 1235, the oaths of six\r\ncompurgators clear a man accused of having commenced hostilities\r\nwithout awaiting the three days term prescribed after defiance, no\r\nevidence being alluded to on either side—“et nisi violator productus\r\nsuper hoc vel septena manu sinodalium hominum purgaverit innocentiam\r\nsuam quod non commiserat contra hoc statutum perpetuo pene subiaceat\r\nquod dicitur erenlos und rehtlos”—Nove Constitutiones Dom.

Lib. VIII. c. ix.).—In\r\nsome other systems of jurisprudence, this unsophisticated mode of\r\nbeclouding justice was obtained by insisting on the employment of\r\nlawyers, whose assertions would not be binding on their clients. Thus,\r\nin the Assises de Jerusalem (Baisse Court, cap. 133): “Et por ce il\r\ndeit estre lavantparlier, car se lavantparlier dit parole quil ne doie\r\ndire por celuy cui il parole, celui por qui il parle et son conceau y\r\npueent bien amender ains que le iugement soit dit. Mais se celuy de cui\r\nest li plais diseit parole qui li deust torner a damage, il ne la peut\r\ntorner arieres puis quil la dite.” The same caution is recommended in\r\nthe German procedure of the fourteenth century—“verbis procuratoris non\r\neris adstrictus, et sic vitabis damnum” (Richstich Landrecht, cap. II.\r\nCf. Jur. Provin. Saxon. Lib. I. art. 60; Lib. II. art. 14). The same\r\nabuse existed in France, but was restricted by St. Louis, who made the\r\nassertion of the advocate binding on the principal, unless contradicted\r\non the spot (Établissements, Liv.

Innocent also endeavored to put an\r\nend to the abuse by which ecclesiastics, notoriously guilty, were\r\nable to escape the penalty due their crimes, by this easy mode of\r\npurgation.—C. 15, eod. loc.\r\n\r\nThe formula as given about 1240 by St. Ramon de Peñafort is\r\n“Nos credimus quod ipse juravit verum, vel, verum esse quod\r\njuravit.”—Raymondi Summæ Lib. III. Tit. xxxi. § 5.\r\n\r\n[204] The rapidity with which the study of the civil law diffused\r\nitself throughout the schools and the eagerness with which it was\r\nwelcomed were the subject of indignant comment by the ecclesiastics\r\nof the day. As early as 1149 we find St. Bernard regretting that the\r\nlaws of Justinian were already overshadowing those of God—“Et quidem\r\nquotidie perstrepent in palatio leges, sed Justiniani, non Domini” (De\r\nConsideratione, Lib. I. cap. iv.). Even more bitter were the complaints\r\nof Giraldus Cambrensis towards the end of the century. The highest of\r\nhigh churchmen, in deploring the decline of learning among the prelates\r\nand clergy of his age, he attributes it to the exclusive attention\r\nbestowed on the jurisprudence of Justinian, which already offered\r\nthe surest prizes to cupidity and ambition, and he quotes in support\r\nof his opinion the dictum of his teacher Mainier, a professor in the\r\nUniversity of Paris: “Episcopus autem ille, de quo nunc ultimo locuti\r\nsumus, inter superficiales numerari potuit, cujusmodi hodie multos\r\nnovimus propter leges Justinianas, quæ literaturam, urgente cupiditatis\r\net ambitionis incommodo, adeo in multis jam suffocarunt, quod magistrum\r\nMainerium in auditorio scholæ suæ Parisius dicentem et damna sui\r\ntemporis plangentem, audivi, vaticinium illud Sibillæ vere nostris\r\ndiebus esse completum, hoc scilicet ‘Venient dies, et væ illis, quibus\r\nleges obliterabunt scientiam literarum’” (Gemm. Ecclesiast. Dist. II.\r\ncap. xxxvii.). This, like all other branches of learning, was as yet to\r\na great extent in the hands of the clergy, though already were arising\r\nthe precursors of those subtle and daring civil lawyers who were\r\ndestined to do such yeoman’s service in abating the pretensions of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular to observe that at a period when the highest\r\noffices of the law were frequently appropriated by ecclesiastics, they\r\nwere not allowed to perform the functions of advocates or counsel. See\r\nHorne’s Myrror of Justice, cap. II. sect. 5. There was good reason\r\nfor prohibiting them from serving as judges, as Frederic II. did in\r\n1235—“Idem erit laicus propter sententias sanguinum quas clerico\r\nscribere non liceat, et præterea ut si dilinquid in officio suo pena\r\ndebita puniatur” (Nove Constitutiones Dom. Alberti, p. 46).\r\n\r\n[205] Actor quod adseverat, probare se non posse profitendo, reum\r\nnecessitate monstrandi contrarium non adstringit: cum per rerum naturam\r\nfactum negantis probatio nulla sit (Const. xxiii. C. de Probat. IV.\r\n19).—Cum inter eum, qui factum adseverans, onis subiit probationis, et\r\nnegantem numerationem, cujus naturali ratione probatio nulla est ...\r\nmagna sit differentia (Const. x. C. de non numerat. IV. 30). It is a\r\nlittle curious to see how completely this was opposed to the principle\r\nof the early Common Law of England, by which in actions for debt\r\n“semper incumbit probatio neganti” (Fleta, Lib. II. cap. lxiii. § 11).\r\n\r\n[206] La cosa que non es non se puede probar nin mostrar segunt\r\nnatura.—Las Siete Partidas, P. III. Tit. xiv. l. 1.\r\n\r\n[207] Though absent from the general laws of Spain, yet compurgation\r\nhad been introduced as an occasional custom. We have seen it above\r\n(p. 49) in the Fuero de Balbás in 1135. The Fuero of Madrid in 1202\r\nprovides that a man suspected of homicide and other crimes, in the\r\nabsence of testimony, can clear himself with six or twelve conjurators,\r\naccording to the grade of the offence (Mem. de la Real. Acad. de la\r\nHistoria, 1852). We shall see hereafter that it appears in the Fuero\r\nViejo of Castile in 1356.

Baior. Lib.\r\nIV. cap. xiv. n. 28). Even as late as 1617, August Viescher, in an\r\nelaborate treatise on the judicial duel, expressed the same reliance\r\non the divine interposition: “Dei enim hoc judicium dicitur, soli Deo\r\ncausa terminanda committitur, Deo igitur authore singulare hoc certamen\r\nsuscipiendum, ut justo judicio adjutor sit, omnisque spes ad solam\r\nsummæ providentiam Trinitatis referenda est” (Viescher Tract. Juris\r\nDuellici Universi, p. 109). This work is a most curious anachronism.\r\nViescher was a learned jurisconsult who endeavored to revive the\r\njudicial duel in the seventeenth century by writing a treatise of\r\n700 pages on its principles and practice. He exhibits the wide\r\nrange of his studies by citations from no less than six hundred and\r\nseventy-one authors, and manages to convey an incredibly small amount\r\nof information on the subject. Ephraim Gerhardt, moreover, taxes him\r\nwith wholesale plagiarism from Michael Beuther’s _Disputatio de duello_\r\n(Strassburg, 1609) and with false citations of authorities.—Eph.\r\nGerhardi Tract. de Judicio Duellico, præfat.\r\n\r\n[285] L.

Some antiquarians have been inclined to assume that\r\nthe duel was practised among the Anglo-Saxons, but the statement in\r\nthe text is confirmed by the authority of Mr. Pike (Hist. of Crime in\r\nEngland, I. 448), whose exhaustive researches into the original sources\r\nof English jurisprudence render his decision virtually final.\r\n\r\nIn the Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson it is related that he was chosen by an\r\nEnglish queen named Gyda for her husband, to the great displeasure of\r\nAlfin a previous pretender to her hand, who challenged him thereupon,\r\nbecause “It was then the custom in England, if two strove for anything,\r\nto settle the matter by single combat” (Laing’s Heimskringla, I. 400).\r\nSnorro Sturleson, however, can hardly be regarded as of much authority\r\non a point like this; and as Gyda is represented as daughter of a king\r\nof Dublin, the incident, if it occurred at all, may have taken place in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n[315] A charter issued by William, which appears to date early in\r\nhis reign, gives the widest latitude to the duel both for his French\r\nand Saxon subjects (L. Guillelmi Conquest. II. §§ 1, 2, 3. Thorpe,\r\nI. 488). Another law, however, enabled a Norman defendant to decline\r\nthe combat when a Saxon was appellant. “Si Francigena appellaverit\r\nAnglum ... Anglus se defendat per quod melius voluerit, aut judicio\r\nferri, aut duello.... Si autem Anglus Francigenam appellaverit et\r\nprobare voluerit, judicio aut duello, volo tunc Francigenam purgare se\r\nsacramento non fracto” (Ibid. III. § 12. Thorpe, I. 493).

On investigation he was found to have\r\nreceived five marks for the service with a promise of five more, and\r\nhe was mercifully treated by being condemned only to the loss of a\r\nfoot—“Sciendum quod misericorditer agitur cum eo per consilium domini\r\nregis cum majorem pœnam de jure demeruisset.”—Maitland, Select Pleas of\r\nthe Crown, I. 127.\r\n\r\n[333] Beaumanoir, chap. vi. § 16.\r\n\r\n[334] Beaumanoir, ch. xxxix. §§ 30, 31, 66.—Assises de Jerusalem,\r\ncap. 169. A somewhat similar principle is in force in the modern\r\njurisprudence of China. Women, persons over eighty or under ten years\r\nof age, and cripples who have lost an eye or a limb are entitled to buy\r\nthemselves off from punishment, except in a few cases of aggravated\r\ncrime. They are, therefore, not allowed to appear as accusers, because\r\nthey are enabled by this privilege to escape the penalties of false\r\nwitness.—Staunton, Penal Code of China, Sects. 20-22, and 339. In the\r\nancient Brahmanic law also there is a long enumeration of persons\r\nwho are not receivable as witnesses, including women, children,\r\nand men over eighty years of age. In this, however, the exclusion\r\nof women would appear to be because they were presumably under\r\ntutelage.—Institutes of Vishnu, VIII. 2.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of women as witnesses during the mediæval period was\r\nalso one of the numerous disabilities by which the Church expressed\r\nits contempt for the sex which had tempted Adam to his fall. As early\r\nas the fourth century Hilary the Deacon, in a tract which long passed\r\ncurrent under the name of St. Augustin, says: “Nec docere enim potest,\r\nnec testis esse, neque fidem dicere, neque judicare” (Hilari Diac.\r\nQuæstt. ex Vet. Testamento, c. xlv.—Migne, T. XXX. p. 2244). And this\r\nwas carried through Ivo of Chartres (Decreti, P. VIII. c. 85) into the\r\nbody of the canon law (Gratiani Decr. Caus. XXXIII. Q. v. cap. 17).\r\n\r\n[335] The earliest of these charters is a grant from Louis le Gros in\r\n1109 to the serfs of the church of Paris, confirmed by Pope Pascal II.\r\nin 1113 (Baluz. et Mansi III. 12, 62). D’Achery (Spicileg. III. 481)\r\ngives another from the same monarch in 1128 to the church of Chartres.\r\n\r\n[336] Beaumanoir, chap. lxi. § 59.\r\n\r\n[337] Ibid. chap. lxi. § 57.\r\n\r\n[338] Ibid. chap. xl. § 21.\r\n\r\n[339] Jur.

Angliæ Lib.\r\nVIII. cap. ix.). The result of a reversal of judgment must probably\r\nhave been a heavy fine and deprivation of the judicial function, such\r\nbeing the penalty provided for injustice in the laws of Henry I.—“Qui\r\ninjuste judicabit, cxx sol. reus sit et dignitatem judicandi perdat”\r\n(L. Henrici I. Tit. xiii. § 4)—which accords nearly with the French\r\npractice in the time of Beaumanoir.\r\n\r\n[341] Cited by Marnier in his edition of Pierre de Fontaines.\r\n\r\n[342] Car poi profiteroient les costumes el païs, s’il s’en covenoit\r\ncombatre; ne dépecier ne les puet-om par bataille.—Édition Marnier,\r\nchap.

Tit. i. vi. viii. x. xxvii. xxxi.—“Et certes\r\nen fausement ne gist ne vie ne menbre de cels qui sont fausé, en\r\nquelconques point que li fausemenz soit faiz, et quele que la querele\r\nsoit” (Ibid. Tit. xix.). If the judge was accused of bribery, however,\r\nand was defeated, he was liable to confiscation and banishment (Tit.\r\nxxvi.). The increasing severity meted out to careless, ignorant, or\r\ncorrupt judges manifests the powerful influence of the Roman law,\r\nwhich, aided by the active efforts of legists, was infiltrating the\r\ncustomary jurisprudence and altering its character everywhere. Thus de\r\nFontaines quotes with approbation the Code, _De pœna judicis_ (Lib.\r\nVII. Tit. xlix. l. 1) as a thing more to be desired than expected,\r\nwhile in Beaumanoir we already find its provisions rather exceeded than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n[344] De Fontaines, chap. XXII.

II. pp. xxx.\r\nxxxi.). Beaumanoir in many cases evidently describes the law as he\r\nwould wish it to be.\r\n\r\n[347] Et pour ce ne l’en puët fausser, car l’en ne trouveroit mie\r\nqui droit en feist car li rois ne tient de nului fors de Dieu et de\r\nluy.—Établissements, Liv.

In a French version of this code, made probably towards\r\nthe close of the fourteenth century, the purport of this passage is\r\nentirely changed. “De chascun iugemant ne puet lan trover leaul ne\r\ncertain consoil si bien come per le consoil de sages de la cort le\r\nroi.”—Miroir de Souabe, P. I. c. cxiii. (Ed. Matile, Neufchatel,\r\n1843). We may hence conclude that by this period the custom of armed\r\nappeal was disused, and the extension of the royal jurisdiction was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n[350] Jur. Provin. Saxon.

This story has been\r\ncalled in question by orthodox writers for the reason that Archbishop\r\nRoderic, who flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century, is\r\nthe only authority for it, but there is nothing in the manners of the\r\nage to render it incredible, and he mentions that the champion of the\r\nMozarabic rite came from Matanza near the Pisuerga, and that his family\r\nstill existed.\r\n\r\nIn 1121, when the Queen-regent Urraca was at Compostella, one of her\r\ncourtiers informed a gentleman of the Archbishop Diego Gelmirez, that\r\nshe was plotting to seize him, whereupon he surrounded himself with\r\na guard. This attracted attention and led to discussion in which the\r\narchbishop’s retainer gave the name of his informant. The latter denied\r\nthe statement and Urraca, as a matter of course, ordered the duel\r\nbetween them, in which her courtier was defeated and was punished with\r\nblinding.—Historia Compostellana, Lib.

The variations in the coinage\r\nare so numerous and uncertain, that to express the values of the\r\nsolidus or sou, at the different periods and among the different\r\nraces enumerated, is virtually impossible. In general terms, it may\r\nbe remarked that the Carlovingian solidus was the twentieth part of\r\na pound of silver, and according to the researches of Guérard was\r\nequivalent in purchasing power to about thirty-six francs of modern\r\nmoney. The marc was half a pound of silver.\r\n\r\n[429] L. Baioar. Tit. VIII. cap. ii. § 5; cap. iii.\r\n\r\n[430] L. Longobard, Lib. ii. cap. lv. § 37.\r\n\r\n[431] L.

At that time the faith\r\nwas exclusively in the hands of the Inquisition, and the canons admit\r\nof no exception to clerical immunity in cases of treason.

This, however, was not the case\r\nelsewhere. Among the glossators on the Lombard law there were warm\r\ndisputes as to the propriety, in certain cases, of forcing one of the\r\ncontestants to commit perjury. The matter will be found treated at some\r\nlength in Savigny’s Geschichte d. Rom. Recht. B. IV. pp. 159 sqq. Cf.\r\nOdofredi Summa de Pugna (Patetta, pp. 485-7).\r\n\r\nThe formula of the oath as given in the Fleta is as follows: The\r\nparties take each other by the hand and first the appellee swears, “Hoc\r\naudis, homo quem per manum teneo, qui A. te facis appellari per nomen\r\nbaptismi tui, quod ego C. fratrem tuum, vel alium parentem vel dominum\r\nnon occidi, vel plagam ei feci ullo genere armorum per quod remotior\r\nesse debuit a vita et morti propinquior; sic me Deus adjuvet et hæc\r\nSancta, etc.” Then the appellant responds: “Hoc audis homo quem per\r\nmanum teneo, qui te R. facis appellari per nomen baptismi tui, quod tu\r\nes perjurus et ideo perjurus quia tali anno, tali die, tali hora et\r\ntali loco nequiter et in felonia occidisti C. fratrum meum tali genere\r\narmorum, unde obiit infra triduum; sic me Deus, etc.”—Lib.

The tale\r\napparently was one which obtained wide currency.\r\n\r\n[709] In 1374 Gregory XI. when condemning the Sachsenspiegel laid\r\nespecial stress on the passages in which the judicial duel was\r\nprescribed (Sachsenspiegel, ed. Ludovici, 1720, p. 619). As late as\r\n1492, the Synod of Schwerin promulgated a canon prohibiting Christian\r\nburial to those who fell in the duel or in tournaments.—Synod.

VII. 259).\r\n\r\n[727] Se ce est hors l’obeissance le Roy, gage de bataille (Étab. de\r\nSt. Louis, Liv. II. chap. xi. xxix. xxxviii.). Beaumanoir repeats it,\r\na quarter of a century later, in the most precise terms, “Car tout cil\r\nqui ont justice en le conté poent maintenir lor cort, s’il lor plest,\r\nselonc l’ancienne coustume; et s’il lor plest il le poent tenir selonc\r\nl’establissement le Roy” (Cout. du Beauv. cap xxxix. § 21). And again,\r\n“Car quant li rois Loïs les osta de sa cort il ne les osta pas des\r\ncours à ses barons” (Cap. LXI. § 15).\r\n\r\n[728] Liv. I. chap. xxvii. xci. cxiii. etc. This is so entirely at\r\nvariance with the general belief, and militates so strongly with the\r\nopening assertion of the Établissements (Ordonn. of 1260) that I should\r\nobserve that in the chapters referred to the direction for the combat\r\nis absolute; no alternative is provided, and there is no allusion to\r\nany difference of practice prevailing in the royal courts and in those\r\nof the barons, such as may be seen in other passages (Liv. I. chap.\r\nxxxviii. lxxxi. cxi. etc.). Yet in a charter of 1263, Louis alludes to\r\nhis having interdicted the duel in the domains of the crown in the most\r\nabsolute manner.—“Sed quia duellum perpetuo de nostris domaniis duximus\r\namovendum” (Actes du Parlement de Paris No. 818 A.

Marnier, p. 30). These minutely subdivided and parcelled out\r\njurisdictions were one of the most prolific causes of debate during the\r\nmiddle ages, not only on account of the power and influence, but also\r\nfrom the profits derived from them. That the privilege of decreeing\r\nduels was not the least remunerative of these rights is well manifested\r\nby the decision of an inquest held during the reign of Philip Augustus\r\nto determine the conflicting jurisdictions of the ducal court of\r\nNormandy and of the seigneurs of Vernon. It will be found quoted in\r\nfull by Beugnot in his notes on the Olim, T. I. p. 969.

It is perhaps needless to add that Mathieu’s\r\nsuit was fruitless.

It is not\r\nunreasonable to conjecture that these lines may have been occasioned\r\nby the celebrated trial of Enguerrand de Coucy in 1256. On the plea\r\nof baronage, he demanded trial by the Court of Peers, and claimed\r\nto defend himself by the wager of battle. St. Louis proved that the\r\nlands held by Enguerrand were not baronial, and resisted with the\r\nutmost firmness the pressure of the nobles who made common cause\r\nwith the culprit. On the condemnation of de Coucy, the Count of\r\nBritanny bitterly reproached the king with the degradation inflicted\r\non his order by subjecting its members to inquest.—Beugnot, Olim I.\r\n954.—Grandes Chroniques ann. 1256.\r\n\r\n[737] Et se li uns et li autres est si enreués, qu’il n’en demandent\r\nnul amesurement entrer pueent par folie en périll de gages (Conseil,\r\nchap.

Laurière alludes\r\nto it (Tabl. dés Ordonn. p. 59), but the passage of Du Cange which\r\nhe cites refers only to prohibition of tournaments. The catalogue of\r\nPardessus and the collection of Isambert contain nothing of the kind,\r\nbut that some legislation of this nature actually occurred is evident\r\nfrom the preamble to the Ordonnance of 1306—“Savoir faisons que comme\r\nça en arrière, pour le commun prouffit de nostre royaume, nous eussions\r\ndefendu généraument à tous noz subgez toutes manieres de guerres\r\net tous gaiges de batailles, etc.” It is worthy of note that these\r\nordonnances of Philippe were no longer confined to the domain of the\r\ncrown, but purported to regulate the customs of the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\n[743] Willelmi Egmond. Chron. (Matthæi Analect.

A few lines further on,\r\nhowever, the Ordonnance makes a concession to the popular superstition\r\nof the time in expressing a conviction that those who address\r\nthemselves to the combat simply to obtain justice may expect a special\r\ninterposition of Providence in their favor—“Et se l’intéressé, sans\r\norgueil ne maltalent, pour son bon droit seulement, requiert bataille,\r\nne doit doubter engin ne force, car le vray juge sera pour lui.”\r\n\r\n[746] Ordonnance de 1306, cap. i.\r\n\r\n[747] Isambert, II. 850.\r\n\r\n[748] See Les Olim, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[749] Actes du Parlement de Paris, I. 446.\r\n\r\n[750] Les Olim, III. 381-7.—Vaissette, Hist.

The former makes it appearance in the latter half of\r\nthe fourteenth century, when the common law duel was falling into\r\ndesuetude.

In this case\r\nthe judge laid down the law that if the approver was vanquished the\r\ndefendant must be hanged for homicide. This strange ruling is not in\r\naccordance with earlier practice. In 1220 an approver accuses seven\r\npersons, but is defeated in the first combat and hanged, whereupon the\r\naccused are discharged on bail (Maitland, Select Pleas, I. 123).

In convicting the empress of\r\ncalumny, the Countess of Modena appeared as an accuser, making good the\r\ncharge by the ordeal; but if we look upon her as simply vindicating\r\nher husband’s character, the case enters into the ordinary course of\r\nsuch affairs. Indeed, among the Anglo-Saxons, there was a special\r\nprovision by which the friends of an executed criminal might clear his\r\nreputation by undergoing the triple ordeal, after depositing pledges,\r\nto be forfeited in cases of defeat (Ethelred, iii. § 6), just as in\r\nthe burgher law of Northern Germany a relative of a dead man might\r\nclaim the duel to absolve him from an accusation (Sachsische Weichbild,\r\nart. lxxxvii.).

The latter\r\nwas chaplain of the Count of Toulouse, and a firm asserter of the\r\nauthenticity of the lance. He relates with pride, that on its discovery\r\nhe threw himself into the trench and kissed it while the point only\r\nhad as yet been uncovered. He officiated likewise in the ordeal,\r\nand delivered the adjuration as Peter entered the flames: “Si Deus\r\nomnipotens huic homini loquutus est facie ad faciem, et beatus Andreas\r\nLanceam Dominicam ostendit ei, cum ipse vigilaret, transeat iste\r\nillæsus per ignem. Sin autem aliter est, et mendacium est, comburatur\r\niste cum lancea quam portabit in manibus suis.” Raoul de Caen, on the\r\nother hand, in 1107 became secretary to the chivalrous Tancred, and\r\nthus obtained his information from the opposite party. He is very\r\ndecided in his animadversions on the discoverers. Foulcher de Chartres\r\nwas chaplain to Baldwin I. of Jerusalem, and seems impartial, though\r\nsceptical.\r\n\r\nThe impression made by the incident on the popular mind is manifested\r\nin the fact that the Nürnberg Chronicle (fol. cxcv.) gives a veritable\r\nrepresentation of the lance-head.\r\n\r\n[979] Raynaldi Annal.

This derives additional\r\nprobability from the text cited immediately above, relative to the\r\nsubstitution of this ordeal for the duel, which is given by Eckhardt\r\nfrom an apparently contemporary manuscript, and which, as we have seen,\r\nis attributed to Louis le Débonnaire in the very year of the Council of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. It is not a simple Capitulary, but an addition to the\r\nSalic Law, which invests it with much greater importance. Lindenbruck\r\n(Cod. Legum Antiq. p. 355) gives a different text, purporting likewise\r\nto be a supplement to the Law, made in 816, which prescribes the duel\r\nin doubtful cases between laymen, and orders the ordeal of the cross\r\nfor ecclesiastical causes—“in Ecclesiasticis autem negotiis, crucis\r\njudicio rei veritas inquiratur”—and allows the same privilege to the\r\n“imbecillibus aut infirmis qui pugnare non valent.” Baluze’s collection\r\ncontains nothing of the kind as enacted in 816, but under date of 819\r\nthere is a much longer supplement to the Salic law, in which cap. x.\r\npresents the same general regulations, almost verbatim, except that in\r\necclesiastical affairs the testimony of witnesses only is alluded to,\r\nand the _judicium crucis_ is altogether omitted. The whole manifestly\r\nshows great confusion of legislation.\r\n\r\n[1076] Chart.

II. cap. 13, which shows that the legend was widely\r\nspread and generally believed, although the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\r\nann. 1052, and Roger de Hoveden, ann. 1053, in mentioning Godwin’s\r\ndeath, make no allusion to its being caused in this manner. A similar\r\nreticence is observable in an anonymous Life of Edward (Harleian MSS.\r\n526, p. 408 of the collection in M. R. Series), and although this is\r\nperhaps the best authority we have for the events of his reign, still\r\nthe author’s partiality for the family of Godwin renders him not\r\naltogether beyond suspicion.\r\n\r\nNo great effort of scepticism is requisite to suggest that Edward,\r\ntired of the tutelage in which he was held, may have made way with\r\nGodwin by poison, and then circulated among a credulous generation the\r\nstory related by the annalists.\r\n\r\n[1085] Lives of Edward the Confessor, p. 119 (M.

Thus, as early as 465, the Council of Vannes\r\ndenounced those who “sub nomine fictæ religionis quas sanctorum\r\nsortes vocant divinationis scientiam profitentur, aut quarumcumque\r\nscripturarum inspectione futura promittant,” and all ecclesiastics\r\nprivy to such proceedings were to be expelled from the church (Concil.\r\nVenet. can. xvi.). This canon is repeated in the Council of Agde\r\nin 506, where the practice is denounced as one “quod maxime fidem\r\ncatholicæ religionis infestat” (Conc. Agathens. can. xlii.); and a\r\npenitential of about the year 800 prescribes three years’ penitence for\r\nsuch acts.—Ghaerbaldi Judicia Sacerdotalia c. 29 (Martene Ampl.

Tornacens. § ii. _ap._\r\nD’Achery, Spicileg. III. 551). Horne’s Myrror of Justice, cap. III.\r\nSect. 23: “En case ou battaille ne se poit joindre ne nul tesmognage\r\nn’avoit lieu ... e le actor n’ad point de testmoignes a prover sa\r\naction, adonque estoit en le volunt del deffendant a purger sa fame\r\nper le miracle de Dieu.” Yet in an English case of murder early in the\r\nthirteenth century, the accused was found with the murdered man’s cap\r\nand the knife with which he had been slain, and the whole vicinage\r\ntestified to it, yet he was allowed to purge himself with the water\r\nordeal.—Maitland, Pleas, etc., p. 80.\r\n\r\n[1221] Ruskaia Prawda, art. 28. Even the evidence of a slave was\r\nsufficient to condemn the accused to the red-hot iron. If he escaped,\r\nthe accuser paid him a small fine, which was not required if the\r\nwitnesses had been freemen. In all cases of acquittal, however, there\r\nwere fines payable to the sovereign and to the ministers of justice.\r\n\r\n[1222] Et omnis accusator vel qui alium impetit, habeat optionem quid\r\nvelit, sive judicium aque vel ferri ... et si fugiet (accusatus) ab\r\nordalio, reddat eum plegius wera sua.—Ethelr. Tit. III. c. vi. (Thorpe\r\nII. 516).\r\n\r\n[1223] Thus, in the Icelandic code—“Quodsi reus ferrum candens se\r\ngerere velle obtulerit, hoc minime rejiciatur.”—Grágás, Sect. VI.\r\nc. 33. So in the laws of Bruges in 1190 (§ 31), we find the accused\r\nallowed to choose between the red-hot iron and a regular inquest—“Qui\r\nde palingis inpetitur, si ad judicium ardentis ferri venire noluerit,\r\nveritatem comitis qualem melius super hoc inveniri poterit, accipiet”\r\n(Warnkönig, Hist. de la Fland. IV. 372)—showing that it was considered\r\nthe most absolute of testimony. And in a constitution of Frederic\r\nBarbarossa “Si miles rusticum de violata pace pulsaverit ... de duobus\r\nunum rusticus eligat, an divino aut humano judicio innocentiam suam\r\nostendat.”—Feudor. Lib. II. Tit. xxvii. § 3.\r\n\r\n[1224] Thus an anonymous ecclesiastic, in an epistle quoted by Juretus\r\n(Observat. in Ivon. Carnot. Epist. 74)—“Simoniaci non admittuntur ad\r\njudicium, si probabiles personæ, etiam laicorum, vel feminarum, pretium\r\nse ab eis recipisse testantur; nec aliud est pro manifestis venire ad\r\njudicium nisi tentare Dominum.”\r\n\r\n[1225] Duellum vel judicium candentis ferri, vel aquæ ferventis,\r\nvel alia canonibus vel legibus improbata, nullomodo in curia\r\nMontispessulani rati sunt, nisi utraque pars convenerit.—Statut.\r\nMontispess. ann. 1204 (Du Cange).\r\n\r\n[1226] Si accolis de neutrius jure constat, adeoque hac in re\r\ntestimonium dicere non queant, tum judicio aquæ res decidatur.—Jur.\r\nProvin.

II. c. 3.—Thorpe, I. 488) by\r\nwhich the duel was reserved for the Norman, and the vulgar ordeal for\r\nthe Saxon, might be supposed to arise from a similar distinction. In\r\nreality, however, it was only preserving the ancestral customs of the\r\nraces, giving to the defendant the privilege of his own law. The duel\r\nwas unknown to the Anglo-Saxons, who habitually employed the ordeal,\r\nwhile the Normans, previous to the Conquest, according to Houard, who\r\nis good authority (Anc. Loix Franc. I. 221-222), only appealed to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n[1252] Martene de Antiq. Eccl. Ritibus Lib. III. c. vii. Ord. 6. For\r\nthe beliefs connected with mortuary masses see Concil.

This last clause would seem to allude to some artifice of\r\nthe operators by which the accused was prevented from sinking in the\r\ncold-water ordeal when a conviction was desired.\r\n\r\nThis common sense view of the miracles so generally believed is the\r\nmore significant as coming from Frederic, who, a few years previously,\r\nwas ferociously vindicating with fire and sword the sanctity of the\r\nHoly Seamless Coat against the aspersions of unbelieving heretics.

Aided by his rod, he\r\ntraced the criminals, by land and water, from Lyons to Beaucaire,\r\nwhere he found in prison a man whom he declared to be a participant,\r\nand who finally confessed the crime. In 1703 Marshal Montrevel and\r\nthe intendant Baville made use of Aymar to discover Calvinists,\r\nof whom numbers were condemned on the strength of his revelations\r\n(Patetta, Le Ordalie, p. 33). Aymar was at length proved to be merely\r\na clever charlatan, but the mania to which he gave rise lasted through\r\nthe eighteenth century, and nearly at its close his wonders were\r\nrivalled by a brother sharper, Campetti. The belief in the powers of\r\nthe divining-rod has not yet died out, and it is frequently used to\r\ndiscover oil wells, springs, mines, etc.\r\n\r\nA good account of Aymar’s career and the discussion to which it gave\r\nrise may be found in Prof. Rubio y Diaz’s “Estudios sobre la Evocacion\r\nde los Espiritus,” Cadiz, 1860, pp. 116-28.\r\n\r\n[1376] Diod.

Chabas qualifies this passage as highly important, being the first\r\nevidence that has reached us of the judicial use of torture in Egypt.\r\nThe question has been a debated one, but the previous evidence adduced\r\nwas altogether inconclusive.\r\n\r\n[1378] Lenormant, Man. de l’Hist.

This was probably only a temporary international regulation\r\nto prevent frontier quarrels and reprisals. That it had no permanent\r\nforce of law is evident from the retention of the procedures of\r\ntorture in all the texts of the Salic law, including the revision by\r\nCharlemagne.\r\n\r\n[1462] First Text, Tit.

Thus\r\nCharlemagne, “Ut in locis ubi mallus publicus haberi solet, tectum tale\r\nconstituatur quod in hiberno et in æstate observandus esse possit”\r\n(Capit. Carol. Mag. II. ann. 809, § xiii.). See also Capit. I. eod.\r\nann. § xxv. Louis le Débonnaire prohibits the holding of courts in\r\nchurches, and adds, “Volumus utique ut domus a comite in locum ubi\r\nmallum teneri debet construatur ut propter calorem solis et pluviam\r\npublica utilitas non remaneat” (Capit. Ludov. Pii. I. ann. 819, § xiv.).\r\n\r\n[1507] In 769, we find Charlemagne commanding the presence of all\r\nfreemen in the general judicial assembly held twice a year, “Ut\r\nad mallum venire nemo tardet, unum circa æstatem et alterum circa\r\nautumnum.” At others of less importance, they were only bound to attend\r\nwhen summoned, “Ad alia vero, si necessitas fuerit, vel denunciatio\r\nregis urgeat, vocatus venire nemo tardet” (Capit. Carol. Mag. ann. 769,\r\n§ xii.).\r\n\r\nIn 809, he desired that none should be forced to attend unless he had\r\nbusiness, “Ut nullus ad placitum venire cogatur, nisi qui caussam habet\r\nad quærendam” (Capit. I. ann. 809, § xiii.).\r\n\r\nIn 819, Louis ordered, that the freemen should attend at least three\r\ncourts a year, “et nullus eos amplius placita observare compellat,\r\nnisi forte quilibet aut accusatus fuerit, aut alium accusaverit, aut\r\nad testimonium perhibendum vocatus fuerit” (Capit. Ludov. Pii. V. ann.\r\n819, § xiv.).\r\n\r\n[1508] Placuit ut adversus absentes non judicetur. Quod si factus\r\nfuerit prolata sententia non valebit.—Capit. Lib. V. § cccxi.\r\n\r\n[1509] This right of appeal was not relished by the seigneurs, who\r\napparently foresaw that it might eventually become the instrument of\r\ntheir destruction. It was long in establishing itself, and was resisted\r\nenergetically. Thus the Kings of England who were Dukes of Aquitaine,\r\nsometimes discouraged the appeals of their French subjects to the\r\ncourts of the King of France by hanging the notaries who undertook to\r\ndraw up the requisite papers.—Meyer, Instit.

A young\r\ngirl, in the disguise of a man, was despatched with letters to Lucius\r\nIII. by the partisans of Wolmar in his struggle with Rudolph for the\r\nbishopric of Trèves. Near Augsburg she was joined by a robber, who,\r\nhearing his pursuers approaching, gave her his bag to hold while he\r\nretired on some pretext to a thicket. Captured with the stolen property\r\nshe was condemned, but she told her story to a priest in confession,\r\nthe wood was surrounded and the robber captured. He was tortured until\r\nhe confessed the crime. Then he retracted, and the question between the\r\ntwo was settled, at the suggestion of the priest, by the ordeal of hot\r\niron, when the robber’s hand was burnt, and the girl’s uninjured. The\r\ntale is a long one, very romantic in its details, and may very probably\r\nhave been ornamented by successive scribes.—Cæsar. Heisterb. Dial.\r\nMirac. Dist.

Under the customary law of the feudal courts, the avocat or\r\n“avantparlier” was freely admitted, but such privilege was incompatible\r\nwith the arbitrary process of which the sole object was to condemn for\r\na crime scarce susceptible of proof. The decretal against heretics\r\nissued in 1235 by Gregory IX. forbids all judges, advocates, and\r\nnotaries from helping the suspected heretic under pain of perpetual\r\ndeprivation of function—“Item, judices, advocati, et notarii nulli\r\neorum officium suum impendant; alioquin eodem officio perpetuo sint\r\nprivati” (Harduin.

See also the similar case of Raoulin du Pré (p.\r\n149), who recanted on the scaffold and protested his innocence “sur\r\nla mort qu’il attendoit à avoir et recevoir presentement,” but who\r\nnevertheless was executed. Also that of Perrin du Quesnoy (p. 164).\r\n\r\n[1593] See the case of Berthaut Lestalon (Ibid. p. 501) accused of\r\nsundry petty thefts and tortured unsuccessfully. The court decided that\r\nin view of the little value of the articles stolen and of their having\r\nbeen recovered by the owners, the prisoner should be tortured again,\r\nwhen, if he confessed, he should be hanged, and if he still denied,\r\nhe should have his right ear cropped and be banished from Paris. This\r\nlogical verdict was carried out. No confession was obtained, and he\r\nwas punished accordingly. Somewhat similar was the case of Jehan de\r\nWarlus (Ibid. p. 157), who was punished after being tortured five times\r\nwithout confession; also that of Jaquet de Dun (Ibid. p. 494).\r\n\r\n[1594] In the Registre Criminel de St. Martin-des-Champs the cases are\r\nrecorded with too much conciseness to give details as to the process,\r\nonly the charge and the sentence being stated. It frequently happens,\r\nhowever, that a man convicted of some petty larceny is stated to have\r\nconfessed more serious previous crimes, which necessarily implies their\r\nconfession being extorted. See, for instance, the case of Jehannin\r\nMaci, arrested in 1338 for having in his possession two brass pots,\r\nthe stealing of which he not only confessed but also “plusures murtres\r\net larrecins avoir fais” for which he was duly drawn on a hurdle and\r\nhanged (_op. cit._ pp. 120-1). The case of Phelipote de Monine (p. 178)\r\nis also suggestive.\r\n\r\n[1595] Registre Criminel du Châtelet de Paris, I. 36.\r\n\r\n[1596] Ibid. I. 201-209.—Somewhat similar was the case of Marguerite\r\nde la Pinele (Ibid. p. 322), accused of stealing a ring, which she\r\nconfessed under torture. As she did not, however, give a satisfactory\r\naccount of some money found upon her, though her story was partially\r\nconfirmed by other evidence, she was again twice tortured. This was\r\napparently done to gratify the curiosity of her judges, for, though no\r\nfurther confession was extracted from her, she was duly buried alive.\r\n\r\nCrimes for which a man was hanged or decapitated were punished in a\r\nwoman by burying or burning. Jews were executed by being hanged by the\r\nheels between two large dogs suspended by the hind legs—a frightful\r\ndeath, the fear of which sometimes produced conversion and baptism on\r\nthe gallows (Ibid. II. 43).\r\n\r\n[1597] Ibid. I. pp. 1, 268, 289; II. 66, etc.\r\n\r\n[1598] Ibid.

Olaus Magnus, in the pride of his Northern blood, looks upon\r\nthe statement in the text as a slander on the rugged Russ—“hoc scilicet\r\npro terribili tormento in ea durissima gente reputari, quæ flammis et\r\neculeis adhibitis, vix, ut acta revelet, tantillulum commovetur”—and\r\nhe broadly hints that the wily ambassador amused himself by hoaxing\r\nthe soft Italian: “Sed revera vel ludibriose bonus præsul a versuto\r\nMuscovitici principis nuntio Demetrio dicto, tempore Clementis VII.\r\ninformatus est Romæ” (Gent. Septent. Hist. Brev. Lib. XI. c. xxvi.).\r\nThe worthy archbishop doubtless spoke of his own knowledge with\r\nrespect to the use of the rack and fire in Russia, but the contempt\r\nhe displays for the torture of a stream of water is ill-founded. In\r\nour prisons the punishment of the shower-bath is found to bring the\r\nmost refractory characters to obedience in an incredibly short time,\r\nand its unjustifiable severity in a civilized age like this may be\r\nestimated from the fact that it has occasionally resulted in the\r\ndeath of the patient. Thus, at the New York State Prison at Auburn,\r\nin December, 1858, a strong, healthy man, named Samuel Moore, was\r\nkept in the shower-bath from a half to three-quarters of an hour, and\r\ndied almost immediately after being taken out. A less inhumane mode\r\nof administering the punishment is to wrap the patient in a blanket,\r\nlay him on his back, and, from a height of about six feet, pour upon\r\nhis forehead a stream from an ordinary watering-pot without the rose.\r\nAccording to experts, this will make the stoutest criminal beg for his\r\nlife in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring the later period of our recent war, when the prevalence of\r\nexaggerated bounties for recruits led to an organized system of\r\ndesertion, the magnitude of the evil seemed to justify the adoption\r\nof almost any means to arrest a practice which threatened rapidly to\r\nexhaust the resources of the country. Accordingly, the shower-bath\r\nwas occasionally put into requisition by the military authorities to\r\nextort confession from suspected deserters, when legal evidence was not\r\nattainable, and it was found exceedingly efficacious.\r\n\r\n[1618] Du Boys, _op. cit._ I. 618.\r\n\r\n[1619] Quod iidem prælati et inquisitores de ipsis Templariis et eorum\r\ncorporibus, quotiens voluerint, ordinent et faciant id quod eis,\r\nsecundum legem ecclesiasticam, videbitur faciendum.—Rymer, Fœdera, III.\r\n203.\r\n\r\n[1620] C. 1 § 1 Clement, V. 3.—Bern.

It would seem that the only torture contemplated by this\r\nordonnance was that of water, as the clerk is directed to record “la\r\nquantité de l’eau qu’on aura baillée audit prisonnier.” This was\r\nadministered by gagging the patient, and pouring water down his throat\r\nuntil he was enormously distended. It was sometimes diversified by\r\nmaking him eject the water violently, by forcible blows on the stomach\r\n(Fortescue de Laudibus Legg. Angliæ, cap. xxii.). Sometimes a piece of\r\ncloth was used to conduct the water down his throat. To this, allusion\r\nis made in the “Appel de Villon”:—\r\n\r\n    “Se fusse des hoirs Hue Capel\r\n      Qui fut extraict de boucherie,\r\n    On ne m’eust, parmy ce drapel,\r\n      Faict boyre à celle escorcherie.”\r\n\r\n[1625] Ordonn. de Villers Cotterets, Août 1539, §§ 162-164 (Isambert,\r\nXIII. 633-4). “Ostant et abolissant tous styles, usances ou coutumes\r\npar lesquels les accusés avoient accoutumés d’être ouïs en jugement\r\npour sçavoir s’ils devoient être accusés, et à cette fin avoir\r\ncommunication des faits et articles concernant les crimes et délits\r\ndont ils étoient accusés.”\r\n\r\n[1626] Anc.

E egli giusto il tormentare gli\r\nuomini per l’altrui delitto?”—Dei Delitte e delle Pene, § XII. A\r\ncurious illustration of its useless cruelty when applied to prisoners\r\nof another stamp is afforded by the record of a trial which occurred\r\nat Rouen in 1647. A certain Jehan Lemarinier, condemned to death for\r\nmurder, was subjected to the _question définitive_. Cords twisted\r\naround the fingers, scourging with rods, the strappado with fifty\r\npounds attached to each foot, the thumbscrew were applied in succession\r\nand together, without eliciting anything but fervent protestations of\r\ninnocence. The officials at last wearied out remanded the convict to\r\nprison, when he sent for them and quietly detailed all the particulars\r\nof his crime, committed by himself alone, requesting especially that\r\nthey should record his confession as having been spontaneous, for the\r\nrelief of his conscience, and not extorted by torment.—Desmaze, Les\r\nPénalités Anciennes, p. 159, Paris, 1866.\r\n\r\n[1632] Ordonnance Criminel d’Août 1670, Tit. xiv. xix.

II. §§ cv. sqq.—Meyer (Instit.\r\nJudiciaires, Liv. VI. chap. xi.) gives a very interesting sketch of the\r\ncauses which led to the overthrow of the old system of jurisprudence\r\nthroughout Germany. He attributes it to the influence of the emperors\r\nand the municipalities, each equally jealous of the authority of\r\nthe feudal nobles, aided by the lawyers, now becoming a recognized\r\nprofession. These latter of course favored a jurisprudence which\r\nrequired long and special training, thus conferring upon them as a\r\nclass peculiar weight and influence.\r\n\r\n[1654] My principal authorities are:—\r\n\r\nRerum Criminalium Praxis, by Josse Damhouder, a lawyer and statesman\r\nof repute in Flanders, where he held a distinguished position under\r\nCharles V. and Philip II. His work was received as an authority\r\nthroughout Europe for two centuries, having passed through numerous\r\neditions, from that of Louvain, in 1554, to that of Antwerp, in 1750.\r\nMy edition is of Antwerp, 1601.\r\n\r\nTractatus de Quæstionibus seu Torturis Reorum, published in 1592 by\r\nJohann Zanger, of Wittenberg, a celebrated jurisconsult of the time,\r\nand frequently reprinted.

II. cap. iv. Nos. 108-120); though, in other\r\naccusations, a judge subjecting a noble to torture should be put to\r\ndeath, and his attempt to commit such an outrage could be resisted\r\nby force of arms (Ibid. No. 103). He adds, however, that no special\r\nprivileges existed in France, Lombardy, Venice, Italy, and Saxony\r\n(Ibid. Nos. 105-7). Scialoja expressly says (Praxis c. xiii.

N’avez vous jamais vu donner la question?\r\n\r\n ISABELLE. Non, et ne le verrai, que je crois de ma vie.\r\n\r\n DANDIN. Venez, je vous en veux faire passer l’envie.\r\n\r\n ISABELLE. Hé!

Sc. dernière.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1705] Fortescue, in his arguments against the use of torture, does\r\nnot fail to recognize that the acquittal of a tortured prisoner is the\r\ncondemnation of the judge—“qui judex eum pronuntiet innocentem, nonne\r\neodem judicio judex ille seipsum reum judicat omnis sævitiæ et pœnarum\r\nquibus innocentem afflixit?”—De Laud. Legg. Angl. cap. xxii.\r\n\r\n[1706] Occurrit hic cautela Bruni dicentis, si judex indebite torserit\r\naliquem facit reum confiteri quod fuit legitime tortus, de qua\r\nconfessione faciat notarium rogatum.—Rosbach. Process. Crim. Tit. V.\r\ncap. xv. No. 6.\r\n\r\n[1707] Quoted by Nicolas, Diss. Mor. et Jurid. sur la Torture, p. 21.\r\nThis mode of torture consisted in placing the accused between two\r\njailers, who pummelled him whenever he began to doze, and thus, with\r\nproper relays, deprived him of sleep for forty hours. Its inventor\r\nconsidered it humane, as it endangered neither life nor limb, but the\r\nextremity of suffering to which it reduced the prisoner is shown by its\r\nefficaciousness.\r\n\r\nMarsigli received much credit for this ingenious invention. Grillandus\r\ninforms us that he experimented with it in a difficult case of two\r\nmonks “et profecto vidi ea quæ prius non credebam, quod illud affert\r\nmaximum tormentum et fastidium in corpore absque aliqua membrorum\r\nlæsione.”—Grillandi de Quæstione et Tortura Art. ii.\r\n\r\nI have purposely abstained from entering into the details of the\r\nvarious forms of torture. They may be interesting to the antiquarian,\r\nbut they illustrate no principle, and little would be gained by\r\ndescribing these melancholy monuments of human error. Those who may be\r\ncurious in such matters will find ample material in Grupen Observat.\r\nJur. Crim. de Applicat. Torment., 4to., Hanov. 1754; Zangeri _op. cit._\r\ncap. IV. Nos. 9, 10; Hieron. Magius de Equuleo cum Appendd. Amstelod.\r\n1664, etc. According to Bernhardi, Johann Graefe enumerates no less\r\nthan six hundred different instruments invented for the purpose.\r\nDamhouder (_op. cit._ cap. xxxvii. Nos. 17-23) declares that torture\r\ncan legally be inflicted only with ropes, and then proceeds to describe\r\na number of ingenious devices. One of these, which he states to produce\r\ninsufferable torment without risk, is bathing the feet with brine and\r\nthen setting a goat to lick the soles.\r\n\r\nThe strappado, or suspension by the arms behind the back with weights\r\nto the feet, was the torture in most general use and most favored by\r\nlegal experts.—Grillandus, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[1708] Augustin Nicholas, _op. cit._ pp. 169, 178.\r\n\r\n[1709] Even this, however, was not deemed necessary in cases of\r\nconspiracy and treason “qui fiunt secreto, propter probationis\r\ndifficultatem devenitur ad torturam sine indiciis”—Emer. a Rosb. Tit.\r\nV. cap. x. No. 20.\r\n\r\n[1710] Fama frequens et vehemens facit indicium ad torturam (Zanger.\r\nc. II. No. 80. Cf. Alberti de Gandino de Quæst. § 39). Reus ante\r\naccusationem vel inquisitionem fugiens et citatus contumaciter absens,\r\nse suspectum reddit ut torqueri possit (Ibid. No. 91. Cf. Simancæ\r\nCathol. Instit. Tit. LXV. Nos. 28-30). Inconstantia sermonis facit\r\nindicium ad torturam (Zanger. Nos. 96-99). Ex taciturnitate oritur\r\nindicium ad torturam (Ibid. No. 103). Physiognomia malam naturam\r\narguit, non autem delictum (Ibid. No. 85). How exceedingly lax was the\r\napplication of these rules may be guessed from a remark of Damhouder’s,\r\nthat although rumor was sufficient to justify torture, yet a contrary\r\nrumor neutralized the first and rendered torture improper.—Damhouder.\r\nRer.

Marsigli in\r\nanother passage (fol. 30 _a_) relates that Alexander III. once secretly\r\npromised a bishop that if he would publicly confess himself guilty of\r\nsimony he should have a dispensation, and on the prelate’s doing so,\r\nimmediately deposed him.\r\n\r\n[1797] Bodin.

Henrici I. cap. v. § 16.\r\n\r\nA curious disregard of this principle occurs in the Welsh laws, which\r\nprovide that when a thief is at the gallows, with the certainty\r\nof being hanged, his testimony as to his accomplices is to be\r\nreceived as sufficient without requiring it to be sworn to on a\r\nrelic—the inseparable condition of all other evidence. By a singular\r\ninconsistency, however, the accomplice thus convicted was not to be\r\nhanged, but to be sold as a slave.—Dimetian Code, Bk. II. ch. v. § 9\r\n(Owen I. 425).\r\n\r\n[1814] Many interesting details on the influence of the Roman law upon\r\nthat of England will be found in the learned work of Carl Güterbock,\r\n“Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law,” recently translated by\r\nBrinton Coxe (Philadelphia, 1866). The subject is one which well\r\ndeserves a more thorough consideration than it is likely to receive at\r\nthe hands of English writers.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe that the _crimen læsæ majestatis_ makes its\r\nappearance in Bracton (Lib. III. Tract. ii. cap. 3, § 1) about the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century, earlier than in France, where, as we\r\nhave seen, the first allusion to it occurs in 1315. This was hardly to\r\nbe expected, when we consider the widely different influences exerted\r\nupon the jurisprudence of the two countries by the Roman law.\r\n\r\n[1815] The passage which has been relied on by lawyers is chap. xxx.:\r\n“Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut dissaisiatur, aut\r\nutlagetur, aut aliquo modo destruatur; nec super eum ibimus, nec super\r\neum mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem\r\nterræ.” If the law just above quoted from the collection of Henry I.\r\ncould be supposed to be still in force under John, then this might\r\npossibly be imagined to bear some reference to it; but it is evident\r\nthat had torture been an existing grievance, such as outlawry, seizure,\r\nand imprisonment, the barons would have been careful to include it in\r\ntheir enumeration of restrictions. Moreover, Magna Charta was specially\r\ndirected to curtail the royal prerogative, and at a later period was\r\nnot held by any one to interfere with that prerogative whenever the\r\nking desired to test with the rack the endurance of his loving subjects.\r\n\r\n[1816] Et come ascuns felons viendrount en Jugement respondre de lour\r\nfelonie, volons que ils viegnent dechausses et descients sauns coiffe,\r\net a teste descouverte, en pure lour cote hors de fers et de chescun\r\nmanere de liens, ïssint que la peine ne lour toille nule manere de\r\nrason, selon par force ne lour estouva mye respondre forsque lour\r\nfraunche volunte.—Britton, chap. v.\r\n\r\n[1817] Per volunté aussi se fait ceste pesché [homicide] si come\r\nper ceux qui painent home tant que il est gehist pur avouer pesché\r\nmortelment.—Horne, The Myrror of Justice, cap.

The expression is somewhat doubtful, and as\r\ntorture had not yet established itself anywhere in Europe as a judicial\r\nprocedure the document alleged can hardly be received as evidence of\r\nits legality.\r\n\r\n[1820] See Fortescue de Laud. Legg. Angliæ. cap. xxxiii.—The jealousy\r\nwith which all attempted encroachments of the Roman law were repelled\r\nis manifested in a declaration of Parliament in 1388. “Que ce royalme\r\nd’Engleterre n’estait devant ces heures, ne à l’entent du roy nostre\r\ndit seignior et seigniors du parlement unque ne serra rulé ne governé\r\npar la ley civill.”—Rot.

It\r\nobtained the nickname of Skevington’s Daughter, corrupted in time to\r\nScavenger’s Daughter. Among other sufferers from its embraces was an\r\nunlucky Irishman, named Myagh, whose plaint, engraved on the walls of\r\nhis dungeon, is still among the curiosities of the Tower:—\r\n\r\n    “Thomas Miagh, which liethe here alone,\r\n    That fayne wold from hens begon:\r\n    By torture straunge mi truth was tryed,\r\n    Yet of my libertie denied.\r\n      1581. Thomas Myagh.” (Jardine, _op. cit._ pp. 15, 30).\r\n\r\n[1832] Jardine, pp. 53, 57-8.\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable to find torture legalized at this period,\r\neven in qualified form of the _question définitive_ in the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts. The Body of Liberties, enacted in 1641, declares:—\r\n\r\n“45. No man shall be forced by Torture to confesse any crime against\r\nhimselfe nor any other, unlesse it be in some Capitall case where\r\nhe is first fully convicted by cleare and suffitient evidence to be\r\nguilty, After which if the case be of that nature, That it is very\r\napparent there be other conspiritours or confederates with him, Then\r\nhe may be tortured, yet not with such Tortures as be Barbarous and\r\ninhumane.”—Whitmore’s Colonial Laws of Massachusetts, Boston, 1889 (N.\r\nY. Nation, No. 1268, p. 318).\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear safe to conclude that this is a limitation on\r\na pre-existing, more general use of torture.\r\n\r\n[1833] Jardine, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[1834] Lecky, Hist. of Rationalism, Am. ed. I. 122.—In his very\r\ninteresting work, Mr. Lecky mentions a case, occurring under the\r\nCommonwealth, of an aged clergyman named Lowes, who, after an\r\nirreproachable pastorate of fifty years, fell under suspicion. “The\r\nunhappy old man was kept awake for several successive nights, and\r\npersecuted ‘till he was weary of his life, and was scarcely sensible of\r\nwhat he said or did.’ He was then thrown into the water, condemned, and\r\nhung.”—Ibid. p. 126.\r\n\r\n[1835] Cobbett’s State Trials, VI. 686.—Although ostensibly not used to\r\nextort confession, this pricking was practically regarded as a torture.\r\nThus in 1677 the Privy Council of Scotland “found that they (_i. e._,\r\nthe inferior magistracy) might not use any torture by pricking or by\r\nwithholding them from sleep” (_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\n[1836] Spottiswoode Miscellany, Edinburgh, 1845, II. 67.\r\n\r\n[1837] Rogers’s Scotland, Social and Domestic, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[1838] Statut.

The three\r\nprincipal that were habitually applied were the penniwinkis, the boots,\r\nand the caschielawis. The first was a kind of thumbscrew; the second\r\nwas a frame in which the leg was inserted, and in which it was broken\r\nby wedges driven in by a hammer; the third was also an iron frame\r\nfor the leg, which was from time to time heated over a brazier. Fire\r\nmatches were sometimes applied to the body of the victim. We read, in\r\na contemporary legal register, of one man who was kept for forty-eight\r\nhours in ‘vehement tortour’ in the caschielawis; and of another who\r\nremained in the same frightful machine for eleven days and eleven\r\nnights, whose legs were broken daily for fourteen days in the boots,\r\nand who was so scourged that the whole skin was torn from his body.”\r\nThese cases occurred in 1596.\r\n\r\nThese horrors are almost equalled by those of another trial in which\r\na Dr. Fian was accused of having caused the storms which endangered\r\nthe voyage of James VI. from Denmark in 1590. James personally\r\nsuperintended the torturing of the unhappy wretch, and after exhausting\r\nall the torments known to the skill and experience of the executioners,\r\nhe invented new ones. All were vain, however, and the victim was\r\nfinally burnt without confessing his ill-deeds (Ibid. p. 123).\r\n\r\n[1841] Rogers, _op. cit._ p. 307.\r\n\r\n[1842] Diurnal of Occurrences in Scotland (Spottiswoode Miscellany, II.\r\n90-91).\r\n\r\n[1843] 7 Anne c. 21.—While thus legislating for the enlightenment\r\nof Scotland, the English majority took care to retain the equally\r\nbarbarous practice of the _peine forte et dure_. This was commenced in\r\n1275 simply as a “prisone forte et dure” (First Statute of Westminster,\r\ncap. xii.; Cf. Britton, cap. xi.) for felons refusing to plead, and\r\nspeedily developed into starvation and nakedness (Fleta, Lib. I. cap.\r\nxxxii. § 33). Horne (Myrror of Justice, cap. I. § viii.; cap. II. §\r\nix.) evidently regards as illegal “le horrible et perillous lien,” and\r\ntreats as murder a death occasioned by it. In spite of this protest the\r\nprocess was rendered still more barbarous by piling weights of iron on\r\nthe poor wretch, and finally the device of a press was adopted in which\r\nhe was squeezed. In this shape it lost its original justification of\r\nwearing out his endurance and forcing him to plead either guilty or\r\nnot guilty, and became a simple punishment of peculiar atrocity, for,\r\nafter its commencement the prisoner was not allowed to plead, but was\r\nkept under the press until death, “donec oneris, frigoris atque famis\r\ncruciatu extinguitur” (Hale, Placit. Coron. c. xliii.). This relic of\r\nmodern barbarism was not abolished until 1772, by 12 Geo. III. c. 20.\r\nThe only case of its employment in America is said to have been that\r\nof Giles Cory, in 1692, during the witchcraft epidemic. Knowing the\r\nhopelessness of the trials, he refused to plead, and was duly pressed\r\nto death (Cobbett’s State Trials, VI. 680).\r\n\r\nWhen the _peine forte et dure_ had become simply a punishment, it was\r\nsometimes replaced by a torture consisting of tying the thumbs together\r\nwith whipcord until the endurance of the accused gave way and he\r\nconsented to plead. This practice continued at least until so late as\r\n1734. See an interesting essay by Prof. James B.
