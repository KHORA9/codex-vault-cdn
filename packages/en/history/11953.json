AND THE DUKES OF\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\n\r\nSully, in his Memoirs, characterizes the reign of Charles VI. as “that\r\nreign so pregnant of sinister events, the grave of good laws and good\r\nmorals in France.”  There is no exaggeration in these words; the\r\nsixteenth century with its St. Bartholomew and The League, the eighteenth\r\nwith its reign of terror, and the nineteenth with its Commune of Paris,\r\ncontain scarcely any events so sinister as those of which France was, in\r\nthe reign of Charles VI., from 1380 to 1422, the theatre and the victim.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Charles V. laid on his bier when it was seen what a loss he\r\nwas and would be to his kingdom.  Discord arose in the king’s own family.\r\nIn order to shorten the ever critical period of minority, Charles V. had\r\nfixed the king’s majority at the age of fourteen.  His son, Charles VI.,\r\nwas not yet twelve, and so had two years to remain under the guardianship\r\nof his four uncles, the Dukes of Anjou, Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon; but\r\nthe last being only a maternal uncle and a less puissant prince than his\r\npaternal uncles, it was between the other three that strife began for\r\ntemporary possession of the kingly power.\r\n\r\nThough very unequal in talent and in force of character, they were all\r\nthree ambitious and jealous.  The eldest, the Duke of Anjou, who was\r\nenergetic, despotic, and stubborn, aspired to dominion in France for the\r\nsake of making French influence subserve the conquest of the kingdom of\r\nNaples, the object of his ambition.  The Duke of Berry was a mediocre,\r\nrestless, prodigal, and grasping prince.  The Duke of Burgundy, Philip\r\nthe Bold, the most able and the most powerful of the three, had been the\r\nfavorite, first of his father, King John, and then of his brother,\r\nCharles V., who had confidence in him and readily adopted his counsels.\r\nHis marriage, in 1369, with the heiress to the countship of Flanders, had\r\nbeen vigorously opposed by the Count of Flanders, the young princess’s\r\nfather, and by the Flemish communes, ever more friendly to England than\r\nto France; but the old Countess of Flanders, Marguerite of France, vexed\r\nat the ill will of the count her son, had one day said to him, as she\r\ntore open her dress before his eyes, “Since you will not yield to your\r\nmother’s wishes, I will cut off these breasts which gave suck to you, to\r\nyou and to no other, and will throw them to the dogs to devour.”  This\r\nsingular argument had moved the Count of Flanders; he had consented to\r\nthe marriage; and the Duke of Burgundy’s power had received such\r\nincrement by it that on the 4th of October, 1380, when Charles VI.  was\r\ncrowned at Rheims, Philip the Bold, without a word said previously to\r\nany, suddenly went up and sat himself down at the young king’s side,\r\nabove his eldest brother, the Duke of Anjou, thus assuming, without\r\nanybody’s daring to oppose him, the rank and the rights of premier peer\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nHe was not slow to demonstrate that his superiority in externals could\r\nnot fail to establish his political preponderance.  His father-in-law,\r\nCount Louis of Flanders, was in almost continual strife with the great\r\nFlemish communes, ever on the point of rising against the taxes he heaped\r\nupon them and the blows he struck at their privileges.  The city of\r\nGhent, in particular, joined complaint with menace.  In 1381 the quarrel\r\nbecame war.  The Ghentese at first experienced reverses.  “Ah! if James\r\nVan Artevelde were alive!” said they.  James Van Artevelde had left a son\r\nnamed Philip; and there was in Ghent a burgher-captain, Peter Dubois, who\r\nwent one evening to see Philip Van Artevelde.  “What we want now,” said\r\nhe, “is to choose a captain of great renown.  Raise up again in this\r\ncountry that father of yours who, in his lifetime, was so loved and\r\nfeared in Flanders.”  “Peter,” replied Philip, “you make me a great\r\noffer; I promise that, if you put me in that place, I will do nought\r\nwithout your advice.”  “Ah! well!” said Dubois, “can you really be\r\nhaughty and cruel?  The Flemings like to be treated so; with them you\r\nmust make no more account of the life of men than you do of larks when\r\nthe season for eating them comes.”  “I will do what shall be necessary,”\r\n said Van Artevelde.  The struggle grew violent between the count and the\r\ncommunes of Flanders with Ghent at their head.  After alternations of\r\nsuccesses and reverses the Ghentese were victorious; and Count Louis with\r\ndifficulty escaped by hiding himself at Bruges in the house of a poor\r\nwoman who took him up into a loft where her children slept, and where he\r\nlay flat between the paillasse and the feather-bed.  On leaving this\r\nasylum he went to Bapaume to see his son-in-law, the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nand to ask his aid.  “My lord,” said the duke to him, “by the allegiance\r\nI owe to you and also to the king you shall have satisfaction.  It were\r\nto fail in one’s duty to allow such a scum to govern a country.  Unless\r\norder were restored, all knighthood and lordship might be destroyed in\r\nChristendom.”  The Duke of Burgundy went to Senlis, where Charles VI.\r\nwas, and asked for his support on behalf of the Count of Flanders.  The\r\nquestion was referred to the king’s council.  The Duke of Berry\r\nhesitated, saying, “The best part of the prelates and nobles must be\r\nassembled and the whole matter set before them; we will see what is the\r\ngeneral opinion.”  In the midst of this deliberation the young king came\r\nin with a hawk on his wrist.  “Well! my dear uncles,” said he, “of what\r\nare you parleying?  Is it aught that I may know?”  The Duke of Berry\r\nenlightened him, saying, “A brewer, named Van Artevelde, who is English\r\nto the core, is besieging the remnant of the knights of Flanders shut up\r\nin Oudenarde; and they can get no aid but from you.  What say you to it?\r\nAre you minded to help the Count of Flanders to reconquer his heritage,\r\nwhich those presumptuous villains have taken from him?”\r\n\r\n“By my faith,” answered the king, “I am greatly minded; go we thither;\r\nthere is nothing I desire so much as to get on my harness, for I have\r\nnever yet borne arms; I would fain set out to-morrow.”  Amongst the\r\nprelates and lords summoned to Compiegne some spoke of the difficulties\r\nand dangers that might be encountered.  “Yes, yes,” said the king, “but\r\n‘begin nought and win nought.’”  When the Flemings heard of the king’s\r\ndecision they sent respectful letters to him, begging him to be their\r\nmediator with the count their lord; but the letters were received with\r\nscoffs, and the messengers were kept in prison.  At this news Van\r\nArtevelde said, “We must make alliance with the English; what meaneth\r\nthis King Wren of France?  It is the Duke of Burgundy leading him by the\r\nnose, and he will not abide by his purpose; we will frighten France by\r\nshowing her that we have the English for allies.”  But Van Artevelde was\r\nunder a delusion; Edward III. was no longer King of England; the\r\nFlemings’ demand was considered there to be arrogant and opposed to the\r\ninterests of the lords in all countries; and the alliance was not\r\nconcluded.  Some attempts at negotiation took place between the advisers\r\nof Charles VI. and the Flemings, but without success.  The Count of\r\nFlanders repaired to the king, who said, “Your quarrel is ours; get you\r\nback to Artois; we shall soon be there and within sight of our enemies.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in November, 1382, the King of France and his army marched\r\ninto Flanders.  Several towns, Cassel, Bergues, Gravelines, and Turnhout,\r\nhastily submitted to him.\r\n\r\nThere was less complete unanimity and greater alarm amongst the Flemings\r\nthan their chiefs had anticipated.  “Noble king,” said the inhabitants,\r\n“we place our persons and our possessions at your discretion, and to show\r\nyou that we recognize you as our lawful lord, here are the captains whom\r\nVan Artevelde gave us; do with them according to your will, for it is\r\nthey who have governed us.”  On the 28th of November the two armies found\r\nthemselves close together at Rosebecque, between Ypres and Courtrai.  In\r\nthe evening Van Artevelde assembled his captains at supper, and,\r\n“Comrades,” said he, “we shall to-morrow have rough work, for the King of\r\nFrance is here all agog for fighting.  But have no fear; we are defending\r\nour good right and the liberties of Flanders.  The English have not\r\nhelped us; well, we shall only have the more honor.  With the King of\r\nFrance is all the flower of his kingdom.  Tell your men to slay all, and\r\nshow no quarter.  We must spare the King of France only; he is a child,\r\nand must be pardoned; we will take him away to Ghent, and have him taught\r\nFlemish.  As for the dukes, counts, barons, and other men-at-arms, slay\r\nthem all; the commons of France shall not bear us ill will; I am quite\r\nsure that they would not have a single one of them back.”  At the very\r\nsame moment King Charles VI. was entertaining at supper the princes his\r\nuncles, the Count of Flanders, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, the\r\nmarshals, &c.  They were arranging the order of battle for the morrow.\r\nMany folks blamed the Duke of Burgundy for having brought so young a\r\nking, the hope of the realm, into the perils of war.  It was resolved to\r\nconfide the care of him to the constable de Clisson, whilst conferring\r\nupon Sire de Coucy, for that day only, the command of the army.  “Most\r\ndear lord,” said the constable to the king, “I know that there is no\r\ngreater honor than to have the care of your person; but it would be great\r\ngrief to my comrades not to have me with them.  I say not that they could\r\nnot do without me; but for a fortnight now I have been getting everything\r\nready for bringing most honor to you and yours.  They would be much\r\nsurprised if I should now withdraw.”  The king was somewhat embarrassed.\r\n“Constable,” said he, “I would fain have you in my company to-day; you\r\nknow well that my lord my father loved you and trusted you more than any\r\nother; in the name of God and St. Denis do whatever you think best.  You\r\nhave a clearer insight into the matter than I and those who have advised\r\nme.  Only attend my mass to-morrow.”  The battle began with spirit the\r\nnext morning, in the midst of a thick fog.  According to the monk of\r\nSt. Denis, Van Artevelde was not without disquietude.  He had bidden one\r\nof his people go and observe the French army; and, “You bring me bad\r\nnews,” said he to the man in a whisper, “when you tell me there are so\r\nmany French with the king: I was far from expecting it.  .  .  .  This is\r\na hard war; it requires discreet management.  I think the best thing for\r\nme is to go and hurry up ten thousand of our comrades who are due.”  “Why\r\nleave thy host without a head?” said they who were about him: “it was to\r\nobey thy orders that we engaged in this enterprise; thou must run the\r\nrisks of battle with us.”  The French were more confident than Van\r\nArtevelde.  “Sir,” said the constable, addressing the king, cap in hand,\r\n“be of good cheer; these fellows are ours; our very varlets might beat\r\nthem.”  These words were far too presumptuous; for the Flemings fought\r\nwith great bravery.  Drawn up in a compact body, they drove back for a\r\nmoment the French who were opposed to them; but Clisson had made\r\neverything ready for hemming them in; attacked on all sides they tried,\r\nbut in vain, to fly; a few, with difficulty, succeeded in escaping and\r\ncasting, as they went, into the neighboring swamps the banner of St.\r\nGeorge.  “It is not easy,” says the monk of St. Denis, “to set down with\r\nany certainty the number of the dead; those who were present on this day,\r\nand I am disposed to follow their account, say that twenty-five thousand\r\nFlemings fell on the field, together with their leader, Van Artevelde,\r\nthe concoctor of this rebellion, whose corpse, discovered with great\r\ntrouble amongst a heap of slain, was, by order of Charles VI., hung upon\r\na tree in the neighborhood.  The French also lost in this struggle some\r\nnoble knights, not less illustrious by birth than valor, amongst others\r\nforty-four valiant men who, being the first to hurl themselves upon the\r\nranks of the enemy to break them, thus won for themselves great glory.”\r\n\r\nThe victory of Rosebecque was a great cause for satisfaction and pride to\r\nCharles VI. and his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy.  They had conquered on\r\nthe field in Flanders the commonalty of Paris as well as that of Ghent;\r\nand in France there was great need of such a success, for, since the\r\naccession of the young king, the Parisians had risen with a demand for\r\nactual abolition of the taxes of which Charles V., on his death-bed, had\r\ndeplored the necessity, and all but decreed the cessation.  The king’s\r\nuncles, his guardians, had at first stopped, and indeed suppressed, the\r\ngreater part of those taxes; but soon afterwards they had to face a\r\npressing necessity: the war with England was going on, and the revenues\r\nof the royal domain were not sufficient for the maintenance of it.  The\r\nDuke of Anjou attempted to renew the taxes, and one of Charles V.’s\r\nformer councillors, John Desmarets, advocate-general in parliament,\r\nabetted him in his attempt.  Seven times, in the course of the year 1381,\r\nassemblies of notables met at Paris to consider the project, and on the\r\n1st of March, 1382, an agent of the governing power scoured the city at\r\nfull gallop, proclaiming the renewal of the principal tax.  There was a\r\nfresh outbreak.  The populace, armed with all sorts of weapons, with\r\nstrong mallets amongst the rest, spread in all directions, killing the\r\ncollectors, and storming and plundering the Hotel de Ville.  They were\r\ncalled the Malleteers.  They were put down, but with as much timidity as\r\ncruelty.  Some of them were arrested, and at night thrown into the Seine,\r\nsewn up in sacks, without other formality or trial.  A fresh meeting of\r\nnotables was convened, towards the middle of April, at Compiegne, and the\r\ndeputies from the principal towns were summoned to it; but they durst not\r\ncome to any decision: “They were come,” they said, “only to hear and\r\nreport; they would use their best endeavors to prevail on those by whom\r\nthey had been sent to do the king’s pleasure.”  Towards the end of April\r\nsome of them returned to Meaux, reporting that they had everywhere met\r\nwith the most lively resistance; they had everywhere heard shouted at\r\nthem, “Sooner death than the tax.”  Only the deputies from Sens had voted\r\na tax, which was to be levied on all merchandise; but, when the question\r\nof collecting it arose, the people of Sens evinced such violent\r\nopposition that it had to be given up.  It was when facts and feelings\r\nwere in this condition in France, that Charles VI. and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy had set out with their army to go and force the Flemish communes\r\nto submit to their count.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Procession went over the Gates----16]\r\n\r\nReturning victorious from Flanders to France, Charles VI. and his uncles,\r\neverywhere brilliantly feasted on their march, went first of all for nine\r\ndays to Compiegne, “to find recreation after their fatigues,” says the\r\nmonk of St.  Denis, “in the pleasures of the chase; afterwards, on the\r\n10th of January, 1383, the king took back in state to the church of St.\r\nDenis the oriflamme which he had borne away on his expedition; and next\r\nday, the 11th of January, he re-entered Paris, he alone being mounted, in\r\nthe midst of his army.”  The burgesses went out of the city to meet him,\r\nand offer him their wonted homage, but they were curtly ordered to\r\nretrace their steps; the king and his uncles, they were informed, could\r\nnot forget offences so recent.  The wooden barriers which had been placed\r\nbefore the gates of the city to prevent anybody from entering without\r\npermission, were cut down with battle-axes; the very gates were torn from\r\ntheir hinges; they were thrown down upon the king’s highway, and the\r\nprocession went over them, as if to trample under foot the fierce pride\r\nof the Parisians.  When he was once in the city, and was leaving Notre\r\nDame, the king sent abroad throughout all the streets an order forbidding\r\nany one, under the most severe penalties, from insulting or causing the\r\nleast harm to the burgesses in any way whatsoever; and the constable had\r\ntwo plunderers strung up to the windows of the houses in which they had\r\ncommitted their thefts.  But fundamental order having been thus upheld,\r\nreprisals began to be taken for the outbreaks of the Parisians, municipal\r\nmagistrates or populace, burgesses or artisans, rich or poor, in the\r\ncourse of the two preceding years;--arrests, imprisonments, fines,\r\nconfiscations, executions, severities of all kinds fell upon the most\r\nconspicuous and the most formidable of those who had headed or favored\r\npopular movements.  The most solemn and most iniquitous of these\r\npunishments was that which befell the advocate-general, John Desmarets.\r\n“For nearly a whole year,” says the monk of St. Denis, “he had served as\r\nmediator between the king and the Parisians; he had often restrained the\r\nfury and stopped the excesses of the populace, by preventing them from\r\ngiving rein to their cruelty.  He was always warning the factious that to\r\nprovoke the wrath of the king and the princes was to expose themselves to\r\nalmost certain death.  But, yielding to the prayers of this rebellious\r\nand turbulent mob, he, instead of leaving Paris as the rest of his\r\nprofession had done, had remained there, and throwing himself boldly\r\namidst the storms of civil discord, he had advised the assumption of arms\r\nand the defence of the city, which he knew was very displeasing to the\r\nking and the grandees.”  When he was taken to execution, “he was put on a\r\ncar higher than the rest, that he might be better seen by everybody.”\r\n Nothing shook for a moment the firmness of this old man of seventy years.\r\n“Where are they who judged me?” he said: “let them come and set forth the\r\nreasons for my death.  Judge me, O God, and separate my cause from that\r\nof the evil-doers.”  On his arrival at the market-place, some of the\r\nspectators called out to him, “Ask the king’s mercy, Master John, that he\r\nmay pardon your offences.”  He turned round, saying, “I served well and\r\nloyally his great-grandfather King Philip, his grandfather King John, and\r\nhis father King Charles; none of those kings ever had anything to\r\nreproach me with, and this one would not reproach me any the more if he\r\nwere of a grown man’s age and experience.  I don’t suppose that he is a\r\nwhit to blame for such a sentence, and I have no cause to cry him mercy.\r\nTo God alone must I cry for mercy, and I pray Him to forgive my sins.”\r\n Public respect accompanied the old and courageous magistrate beyond the\r\nscaffold; his corpse was taken up by his friends, and at a later period\r\nhonorably buried in the church of St. Catherine.\r\n\r\nAfter the chastisements came galas again, of which the king and his court\r\nwere immoderately fond.  Young as he was (he was but seventeen), his\r\npowerful uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, was very anxious to get him\r\nmarried, so as to secure his own personal influence over him.  The wise\r\nCharles V., in his dying hours, had testified a desire that his son\r\nshould seek alliances in Germany.  A son of the reigning duke, Stephen of\r\nBavaria, had come to serve in the French army, and the Duke of Burgundy\r\nhad asked him if there were any marriageable princess of Bavaria.  “My\r\neldest brother,” answered the Bavarian, “has a very beautiful daughter,\r\naged fourteen.”  “That is just what we want,” said the Burgundian: “try\r\nand get her over here; the king is very fond of beautiful girls; if she\r\ntakes his fancy, she will be Queen of France.”  The Duke of Bavaria,\r\nbeing informed by his brother, at first showed some hesitation.  “It\r\nwould be a great honor,” said he, “for my daughter to be Queen of France;\r\nbut it is a long way from here.  If my daughter were taken to France, and\r\nthen sent back to me because she was not suitable, it would cause me too\r\nmuch chagrin.  I prefer to marry her at my leisure, and in my own\r\nneighborhood.”  The matter was pressed, however, and at last the Duke of\r\nBavaria consented.  It was agreed that the Princess Isabel should go on\r\na visit to the Duchess of Brabant, who instructed her, and had her well\r\ndressed, say the chroniclers, for in Germany they clad themselves too\r\nsimply for the fashions of France.  Being thus got ready, the Princess\r\nIsabel was conducted to Amiens, where the king then was, to whom her\r\nportrait had already been shown.  She was presented to him, and bent the\r\nknee before him.  He considered her charming.  Seeing with what pleasure\r\nhe looked upon her, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, said to Sire De\r\nConey, “By my faith, she will bide with us.”  The same evening, the young\r\nking said to his councillor, Bureau de la Riviere, “She pleases me: go\r\nand tell my uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, to conclude at once.”  The duke,\r\ndelighted, lost no time in informing the ladies of the court, who cried,\r\n“Noel!” for joy.  The duke had wished the nuptials to take place at\r\nArras; but the young king, in his impatience, was urgent for Amiens,\r\nwithout delay, saying that he couldn’t sleep for her.  “Well, well,”\r\n replied his uncle, “you must be cured of your complaint.”  On the 18th\r\nof July, 1385, the marriage was celebrated at the cathedral of Amiens,\r\nwhither the Princess Isabel “was conducted in a handsome chariot, whereof\r\nthe tires of the wheels were of silvern stuff.”  King, uncles, and\r\ncourtiers were far from a thought of the crimes and shame which would be\r\nconnected in France with the name of Isabel of Bavaria.  There is still\r\nmore levity and imprudence in the marriages of kings than in those of\r\ntheir subjects.\r\n\r\nWhilst this marriage was being celebrated, the war with England, and her\r\nnew king, Richard II., was going on, but slackly and without result.\r\nCharles VI. and his uncle of Burgundy, still full of the proud confidence\r\ninspired by their success against the Flemish and Parisian communes,\r\nresolved to strike England a heavy blow, and to go and land there with a\r\npowerful army.  Immense preparations were made in France for this\r\nexpedition.  In September, 1386, there were collected in the port of\r\nEcluse (Sluys) and at sea, between Sluys and Blankenberg, thirteen\r\nhundred and eighty-seven vessels, according to some, and according to\r\nothers only nine hundred, large and small; and Oliver de Clisson had\r\ncaused to be built at Trdguier, in Brittany, a wooden town which was to\r\nbe transported to England and rebuilt after landing, “in such sort,” says\r\nFroissart, “that the lords might lodge therein and retire at night, so as\r\nto be in safety from sudden awakenings, and sleep in greater security.”\r\n Equal care was taken in the matter of supplies.  “Whoever had been at\r\nthat time at Bruges, or the Dam, or the Sluys would have seen how ships\r\nand vessels were being laden by torchlight, with hay in casks, biscuits\r\nin sacks, onions, peas, beans, barley, oats, candles, gaiters, shoes,\r\nboots, spurs, iron, nails, culinary utensils, and all things that can be\r\nused for the service of man.”  Search was made everywhere for the various\r\nsupplies, and they were very dear.  “If you want us and our service,”\r\n said the Hollanders, “pay us on the nail; otherwise we will be neutral.”\r\n To the intelligent foresight shown in these preparations was added\r\nuseless magnificence.  “On the masts was nothing to be seen but paintings\r\nand gildings; everything was emblazoned and covered with armorial\r\nbearings.  But nothing came up to the Duke of Burgundy’s ship; it was\r\npainted all over outside with blue and gold, and there were five huge\r\nbanners with the arms of the duchy of Burgundy and the countships of\r\nFlanders, Artois, Rethel, and Burgundy, and everywhere the duke’s device,\r\n‘I’m a-longing.’”  The young king, too, displayed great anxiety to enter\r\non the campaign.  He liked to go aboard his ship, saying, “I am very\r\neager to be off; I think I shall be a good sailor, for the sea does me no\r\nharm.”  But everybody was not so impatient as the king, who was waiting\r\nfor his uncle, the Duke of Berry, and writing to him letter after letter,\r\nurging him to come.  The duke, who had no liking for the expedition,\r\ncontented himself with making an answer bidding him “not to take any\r\ntrouble, but to amuse himself, for the matter would probably terminate\r\notherwise than was imagined.”  The Duke of Berry at last arrived at Sluys\r\non the 14th of October, 1386.  “If it hadn’t been for you, uncle,” said\r\nthe king to him, “we should have been by this time in England.”  Three\r\nmonths had gone by; the fine season was past; the winds were becoming\r\nviolent and contrary; the vessels come from Treguier with the constable\r\nto join the fleet had suffered much on the passage; and deliberations\r\nwere recommencing touching the opportuneness, and even the feasibility,\r\nof the expedition thus thrown back. “If anybody goes to England, I will,”\r\n said the king. But nobody went. “One day when it was calm,” says the monk\r\nof St. Denis, “the king, completely armed, went with his uncles aboard of\r\nthe royal vessel; but the wind did not permit them to get more than two\r\nmiles out to sea, and drove them back, in spite of the sailors’ efforts,\r\nto the shore they had just left.  The king, who saw with deep displeasure\r\nhis hopes thus frustrated, had orders given to his troops to go back,\r\nand, at his departure, left, by the advice of his barons, some men-of-war\r\nto unload the fleet, and place it in a place of safety as soon as\r\npossible.  But the enemy gave them no time to execute the order.  As soon\r\nas the calm allowed the English to set sail, they bore down on the\r\nFrench, burned or took in tow to their own ports the most part of the\r\nfleet, carried off the supplies, and found two thousand casks full of\r\nwine, which sufficed a long while for the wants of England.”\r\n\r\nSuch a mistake, after such a fuss, was probably not unconnected with a\r\nresolution adopted by Charles VI. some time after the abandonment of the\r\nprojected expedition against England.  In October, 1388, he assembled at\r\nRheims a grand council, at which were present his two uncles, the Dukes\r\nof Burgundy and Berry [the third, the Duke of Anjou, had died in Italy,\r\non the 20th of September, 1384, after a vain attempt to conquer the\r\nkingdom of Naples], his brother, the Duke of Orleans, his cousins, and\r\nseveral prelates and lords of note.  The chancellor announced thereat\r\nthat he had been ordered by the king to put in discussion the question,\r\nwhether it were not expedient that he should henceforth take the\r\ngovernment of his kingdom upon himself.  Cardinal Ascelin de Montaigu,\r\nBishop of Laon, the first to be interrogated upon this subject, replied\r\nthat, in his opinion, the king was quite in a condition, as well as in a\r\nlegal position, to take the government of his kingdom upon himself, and,\r\nwithout naming anybody, he referred to the king’s uncles, and especially\r\nto the Duke of Burgundy, as being no longer necessary for the government\r\nof France.  Nearly all who were present were of the same opinion.  The\r\nking, without further waiting, thanked his uncles for the care they had\r\ntaken of his dominions and of himself, and begged them to continue their\r\naffection for him.  Neither the Duke of Burgundy nor the Duke of Berry\r\nhad calculated upon this resolution; they submitted, without making any\r\nobjection, but not without letting a little temper leak out.  The Duke of\r\nBerry even said that he and his brother would beg the king to confer with\r\nthem more maturely on the subject when he returned to Paris.  Hereupon\r\nthe council broke up; the king’s two uncles started for their own\r\ndominions; and a few weeks afterwards the Cardinal-bishop of Laon died\r\nof a short illness.  “It was generally believed,” says the monk of St.\r\nDenis, “that he died of poison.”  At his own dying wish, no inquiry was\r\ninstituted on this subject.  The measure adopted in the late council was,\r\nhowever, generally approved of.  The king was popular; he had a good\r\nheart, and courteous and gentle manners; he was faithful to his friends,\r\nand affable to all; and the people liked to see him passing along the\r\nstreets.  On taking in hand the government, he recalled to it the former\r\nadvisers of his father, Charles V., Bureau de la Riviere, Le Mercier de\r\nNoviant, and Le Begue de Vilaine, all men of sense and reputation.  The\r\ntaxes were diminished; the city of Paris recovered a portion of her\r\nmunicipal liberties; there was felicitation for what had been obtained,\r\nand there was hope of more.\r\n\r\nCharles VI.  was not content with the satisfaction of Paris only; he\r\nwished all his realm to have cognizance of and to profit by his\r\nindependence.  He determined upon a visit to the centre and the south of\r\nFrance.  Such a trip was to himself, and to the princes and cities that\r\nentertained him, a cause of enormous expense.  “When the king stopped\r\nanywhere, there were wanted for his own table, and for the maintenance of\r\nhis following, six oxen, eighty sheep, thirty calves, seven hundred\r\nchickens, two hundred pigeons, and many other things besides.  The\r\nexpenses for the king were set down at two hundred and thirty livres a\r\nday, without counting the presents which the large towns felt bound to\r\nmake him.”  But Charles was himself magnificent even to prodigality, and\r\nhe delighted in the magnificence of which he was the object, without\r\ntroubling himself about their cost to himself.  Between 1389 and 1390,\r\nfor about six months, he travelled through Burgundy, the banks of the\r\nRhone, Languedoc, and the small principalities bordering on the Pyrenees.\r\nEverywhere his progress was stopped for the purpose of presenting to him\r\npetitions or expressing wishes before him.  At Nimes and Montpellier, and\r\nthroughout Languedoc, passionate representations were made to him\r\ntouching the bad government of his two uncles, the Dukes of Anjou and\r\nBerry.  “They had plundered and ruined,” he was told, “that beautiful and\r\nrich province; there were five or six talliages a year; one was no sooner\r\nover than another began; they had levied quite three millions of gold\r\nfrom Villeneuve-d’Avignon to Toulouse.”  Charles listened with feeling,\r\nand promised to have justice done, and his father’s old councillors, who\r\nwere in his train, were far from dissuading him.  The Duke of Burgundy,\r\nseeing him start with them in his train, had testified his spite and\r\ndisquietude to the Duke of Berry, saying, “Aha! there goes the king on a\r\nvisit to Languedoc, to hold an inquiry about those who have governed it.\r\nFor all his council be takes with him only La Riviere, Le Mercier,\r\nMontaigu, and Le Begue de Vilaine.  What say you to that, my brother?”\r\n “The king, our nephew, is young,” answered the Duke of Berry: “if he\r\ntrusts the new councillors he is taking, he will be deceived, and it will\r\nend ill, as you will see.  As for the present, we must support him.  The\r\ntime will come when we will make those councillors, and the king himself,\r\nrue it.  Let them do as they please, by God: we will return to our own\r\ndominions.  We are none the less the two greatest in the kingdom, and so\r\nlong as we are united, none can do aught against us.”\r\n\r\nThe future is a blank, as well to the anxieties as to the hopes of men.\r\nThe king’s uncles were on the point of getting back the power which they\r\nbelieved to be lost to them.  On the 13th of June, 1392, the constable,\r\nOliver de Clisson, was waylaid as he was returning home after a banquet\r\ngiven by the king at the hostel of St. Paul.  The assassin was Peter de\r\nCraon, cousin of John IV., Duke of Brittany.  He believed De Clisson to\r\nbe dead, and left him bathed in blood at a baker’s door in the street\r\ncalled Culture-Sainte-Catherine.  The king was just going to bed, when\r\none of his people came and said to him, “Ah! sir, a great misfortune has\r\nhappened in Paris.”  “What, and to whom?” said the king.  “To your\r\nconstable, sir, who has just been slain.”  “Slain!” cried Charles; “and\r\nby whom?”  “Nobody knows; but it was close by here, in St. Catherine\r\nStreet.”  “Lights! quick!” said the king; “I will go and see him;” and he\r\nset off, without waiting for his following.  When he entered the baker’s\r\nshop, De Clisson, grievously wounded, was just beginning to recover his\r\nsenses.  “Ah! constable,” said the king, “and how do you feel?”  “Very\r\npoorly, dear sir.”  “And who brought you to this pass?”  “Peter de Craon\r\nand his accomplices; traitorously and without warning.”  “Constable,”\r\n said the king, “never was anything so punished or dearly paid for as this\r\nshall be; take thought for yourself, and have no further care; it is my\r\naffair.”  Orders were immediately given to seek out Peter de Craon, and\r\nhurry on his trial.  He had taken refuge, first in his own castle of\r\nSable, and afterwards with the Duke of Brittany, who kept him concealed,\r\nand replied to the king’s envoys that he did not know where he was.  The\r\nking proclaimed his intention of making war on the Duke of Brittany until\r\nPeter de Craon should be discovered, and justice done to the constable.\r\nPreparations for war were begun; and the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy\r\nreceived orders to get ready for it, themselves and their vassals.  The\r\nformer, who happened to be in Paris at the time of the attack, did not\r\ncare to directly oppose the king’s project; but he evaded, delayed, and\r\npredicted a serious war.  According to Froissart, he had been warned, the\r\nmorning before the attack, by a simple cleric, of Peter de Craon’s\r\ndesign; but, “It is too late in the day,” he had said; “I do not like to\r\ntrouble the king to-day; to-morrow, without fail, we will see to it.”  He\r\nhad, however, forgotten or neglected to speak to his nephew.  Neither he\r\nnor his brother, the Duke of Burgundy, there is reason to suppose, were\r\naccomplices in the attack upon De Clisson, but they were not at all sorry\r\nfor it.  It was to them an incident in the strife begun between\r\nthemselves, princes of the blood royal, and those former councillors of\r\nCharles V., and now, again, of Charles VI., whom, with the impertinence\r\nof great lords, they were wont to call the marinosettes.  They left\r\nnothing undone to avert the king’s anger and to preserve the Duke of\r\nBrittany from the war which was threatening him.\r\n\r\nCharles VI.’s excitement was very strong, and endured forever.  He\r\npressed forward eagerly his preparations for war, though attempts were\r\nmade to appease him.  He was recommended to take care of himself; for he\r\nhad been ill, and could scarcely mount his horse; and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy remonstrated with him several times on the fatigue he was\r\nincurring.  “I find it better for me,” he answered, “to be on horseback,\r\nor working at my council, than to keep resting.  Whoso wishes to persuade\r\nme otherwise is not of my friends, and is displeasing to me.”  A letter\r\nfrom the Queen of Arragon gave some ground for supposing that Peter de\r\nCraon had taken refuge in Spain; and the Duke of Burgundy took advantage\r\nof it to dissuade the king from his prompt departure for the war in\r\nBrittany.  “At the very least,” he said, “it was right to send to Arragon\r\nto know the truth of the matter, and to thank the queen for her\r\ncourtesy.”  “We are quite willing, uncle,” answered Charles: “you need\r\nnot be vexed; but for my own part I hold that this traitor of a Peter de\r\nCraon is in no other prison and no other Barcelona than there is in being\r\nquite comfortable at the Duke of Brittany’s.”  There was no way of\r\ndeterring him from his purpose.  He had got together his uncles and his\r\ntroops at Le Mans; and, after passing three weeks there, he gave the word\r\nto march for Brittany.  The tragic incident which at that time occurred\r\nhas nowhere been more faithfully or better narrated than in M. de\r\nBarante’s History of the Dukes of Burgundy.  “It was,” says he, “the\r\nbeginning of August, 1392, during the hottest days of the year.  The sun\r\nwas blazing, especially in those sandy districts.  The king was on\r\nhorseback, clad in a short and tight dress called a jacket.  His was of\r\nblack velvet, and very oppressive.  On his head he wore a cap of scarlet\r\nvelvet, ornamented with a chaplet of large pearls, which the queen had\r\ngiven him at his departure.  Behind him were two pages on horseback.  In\r\norder not to incommode the king with dust, he was left to march almost\r\nalone.  To the left of him were the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, some\r\npaces in front, conversing together.  The Duke of Orleans, the Duke of\r\nBourbon, Sire de Coney, and some others were also in front, forming\r\nanother group.  Behind were Sires de Navarre, de Bar, d’Albret, d’Artois,\r\nand many others in one pretty large troop.  They rode along in this\r\norder, and had just entered the great forest of Le Mans, when all at once\r\nthere started from behind a tree by the road-side a tall man, with bare\r\nhead and feet, clad in a common white smock, who, dashing forward and\r\nseizing the king’s horse by the bridle, cried, ‘Go no farther; thou art\r\nbetrayed!’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘“Thou art betrayed.”’----26]\r\n\r\nThe men-at-arms hurried up immediately, and striking the hands of the\r\nfellow with the butts of their lances, made him let go the bridle.  As he\r\nhad the appearance of a poor madman, and nothing more, he was allowed to\r\ngo without any questioning, and he followed the king for nearly half an\r\nhour, repeating the same cry from a distance.  The king was much troubled\r\nat this sudden apparition; and his head, which was very weak, was quite\r\nturned by it.  Nevertheless the march was continued.  When the forest had\r\nbeen traversed, they came to a great sandy plain, where the rays of the\r\nsun were more scorching than ever.  One of the king’s pages, overcome by\r\nthe heat, had fallen asleep, and the lance he carried fell against his\r\nhelmet, and suddenly caused a loud clash of steel.\r\n\r\n“The king shuddered; and then he was observed, rising in his stirrups, to\r\ndraw his sword, touch his horse with the spur, and make a dash, crying,\r\n‘Forward upon these traitors!  They would deliver me up to the enemy!’\r\nEvery one moved hastily aside, but not before some were wounded; it is\r\neven said that several were killed, among them a bastard of Polignac.\r\nThe king’s brother, the Duke of Orleans, happened to be quite close by.\r\n‘Fly, my nephew d’Orleans,’ shouted the Duke of Burgundy: ‘my lord is\r\nbeside himself.  My God! let some one try and seize him!’  He was so\r\nfurious that none durst risk it; and he was left to gallop hither and\r\nthither, and tire himself in pursuit of first one and then another.  At\r\nlast, when he was weary and bathed in sweat, his chamberlain, William de\r\nMartel, came up behind and threw his arms about him.  He was surrounded,\r\nhad his sword taken from him, was lifted from his horse, and laid gently\r\non the ground, and then his jacket was unfastened.  His brother and his\r\nuncles came up, but his eyes were fixed and recognized nobody, and he did\r\nnot utter a word.  ‘We must go back to Le Mans,’ said the Dukes of Berry\r\nand Burgundy: ‘here is an end of the trip to Brittany.’ On the way they\r\nfell in with a wagon drawn by oxen; in this they laid the King of France,\r\nhaving bound him for fear of a renewal of his frenzy, and so took him\r\nback, motionless and speechless, to the town.”\r\n\r\nIt was not a mere fit of delirious fever; it was the beginning of a\r\nradical mental derangement, sometimes in abeyance, or at least for some\r\ntime alleviated, but bursting out again without appreciable reason, and\r\naggravated at every fresh explosion.  Charles VI. had always had a taste\r\nfor masquerading.  When in 1389 the young queen, Isabel of Bavaria, came\r\nto Paris to be married, the king, on the morning of her entry, said to\r\nhis chamberlain, Sire de Savoisy, “Prithee, take a good horse, and I will\r\nmount behind thee; and we will dress so as not to be known and go to see\r\nmy wife cone in.”  Savoisy did not like it, but the king insisted; and so\r\nthey went in this guise through the crowd, and got many a blow from the\r\nofficers’ staves when they attempted to approach too near the procession.\r\nIn 1393, a year after his first outbreak of madness, the king, during an\r\nentertainment at court, conceived the idea of disguising as savages\r\nhimself and five of his courtiers.  They had been sewn up in a linen skin\r\nwhich defined their whole bodies; and this skin had been covered with a\r\nresinous pitch, so as to hold sticking upon it a covering of tow, which\r\nmade them appear hairy from head to foot.  Thus disguised these savages\r\nwent dancing into the ball-room; one of those present took up a lighted\r\ntorch and went up to them; and in a moment several of them were in\r\nflames.  It was impossible to get off the fantastic dresses clinging to\r\ntheir bodies.  “Save the king!” shouted one of the poor masquers; but it\r\nwas not known which was the king.  The Duchess de Berry, his aunt,\r\nrecognized him, caught hold of him, and wrapped him in her robe, saying,\r\n“Do not move; you see your companions are burning.”  And thus he was\r\nsaved amidst the terror of all present.  When he was conscious of his mad\r\nstate, he was horrified; he asked pardon for the injury he had done,\r\nconfessed and received the communion.  Later, when he perceived his\r\nmalady returning, he would allude to it with tears in his eyes, ask to\r\nhave his hunting-knife taken away, and say to those about him, “If any of\r\nyou, by I know not what witchcraft, be guilty of my sufferings, I adjure\r\nhim, in the name of Jesus Christ, to torment me no more, and to put an\r\nend to me forthwith without making me linger so.”  He conceived a horror\r\nof Queen Isabel, and, without recognizing her, would say when he saw her,\r\n“What woman is this?  What does she want?  Will she never cease her\r\nimportunities?  Save me from her persecution!”  At first great care was\r\ntaken of him.  They sent for a skilful doctor from Laon, named William de\r\nHarsely, who put him on a regimen from which, for some time, good effects\r\nwere experienced.  But the doctor was uncomfortable at court; he\r\npreferred going back to his little place at Laon, where he soon\r\nafterwards died; and eleven years later, in 1405, nobody took any more\r\ntrouble about the king.  He was fed like a dog, and allowed to fall\r\nravenously upon his food.  For five whole months he had not a change of\r\nclothes.  At last some shame was felt for this neglect, and an attempt\r\nwas made to repair it.  It took a dozen men to overcome the madman’s\r\nresistance.  He was washed, shaved, and dressed in fresh clothes.  He\r\nbecame more composed, and began once more to recognize certain persons,\r\namongst others, the former provost of Paris, Juvenal des Ursins, whose\r\nvisit appeared to give him pleasure, and to whom he said, without well\r\nknowing why, “Juvenal, let us not waste our time.”  On his good days he\r\nwas sometimes brought in to sit at certain councils at which there was a\r\ndiscussion about the diminution of taxes and relief of the people, and he\r\nshowed symptoms, at intervals, of taking an interest in them.  A fair\r\nyoung Burgundian, Odette de Champdivers, was the only one amongst his\r\nmany favorites who was at all successful in soothing him during his\r\nviolent fits.  It was Duke John the Fearless, who had placed her near the\r\nking, that she might promote his own influence, and she took advantage of\r\nit to further her own fortunes, which, however, did not hinder her from\r\nafterwards passing into the service of Charles VII. against the house of\r\nBurgundy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles VI. and Odette----71]\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, from 1392 to 1422, the crown remained on the head of\r\nthis poor madman, whilst France was a victim to the bloody quarrels of\r\nthe royal house, to national dismemberment, to licentiousness in morals,\r\nto civil anarchy, and to foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nWhen, for the first time, in the forest of Le Mans, the Dukes of Berry\r\nand Burgundy saw their nephew in this condition, their first feeling was\r\none of sorrow and disquietude.  The Duke of Burgundy especially, who was\r\naccessible to generous and sympathetic emotions, cried out with tears, as\r\nhe embraced the king, “My lord and nephew, comfort me with just one\r\nword!”  But the desires and the hopes of selfish ambition reappeared\r\nbefore long more prominently than these honest effusions of feeling.\r\n“All!” said the Duke of Berry, “De Clisson, La Mviere, Noviant, and\r\nVilaine have been haughty and harsh towards me; the time has come when\r\nI shall pay them out in the same coin from the same mint.”  The\r\nguardianship of the king was withdrawn from his councillors, and\r\ntransferred to four chamberlains chosen by his uncles.  The two dukes,\r\nhowever, did not immediately lay hands on the government of the kingdom;\r\nthe constable De Clisson and the late councillors of Charles V. remained\r\nin charge of it for some time longer; they had given enduring proofs of\r\ncapacity and fidelity to the king’s service; and the two dukes did not\r\nat first openly attack them, but labored strenuously, nevertheless, to\r\ndestroy them.  The Duke of Burgundy one day said to Sire de Noviant,\r\n“I have been overtaken by a very pressing business, for which I require\r\nforthwith thirty thousand crowns; let me have them out of my lord’s\r\ntreasury; I will restore them at another time.”  Noviant answered\r\nrespectfully that the council must be spoken to about it.  “I wish none\r\nto know of it,” said the duke.  Noviant persisted.  “You will not do me\r\nthis favor?” rejoined the duke; “you shall rue it before long.”  It was\r\nagainst the constable that the wrath of the princes was chiefly directed.\r\nHe was the most powerful and the richest.  One day he went, with a single\r\nsquire behind him, to the Duke of Burgundy’s house; and, “My lord,” said\r\nhe, “many knights and squires are persecuting me to get the money which\r\nis owing to them.  I know not where to find it.  The chancellor and the\r\ntreasurer refer me to you.  Since it is you and the Duke of Berry who\r\ngovern, may it please you to give me an answer.”  “Clisson,” said the\r\nduke, “you have no occasion to trouble yourself about the state of the\r\nkingdom; it will manage very well without your services.  Whence, pray,\r\nhave you been able to amass so much money?  My lord, my brother of Berry\r\nand myself have not so much between us three.  Away from my presence, and\r\nlet me see you no more!  If I had not a respect for myself, I would have\r\nyour other eye put out.”  Clisson went out, mounted his horse, returned\r\nto his house, set his affairs in order, and departed, with two\r\nattendants, to his strong castle of Montlhery.  The two dukes were very\r\nsorry that they had not put him under arrest on the spot.  The rupture\r\ncame to a climax.  Of the king’s four other councillors one escaped in\r\ntime; two were seized and thrown into prison; the fourth, Bureau de la\r\nRiviere was at his castle of Auneau, near Chartres, honored and beloved\r\nby all his neighbors.  Everybody urged him to save himself.  “If I were\r\nto fly or hide myself,” said he, “I should acknowledge myself guilty of\r\ncrimes from which I feel myself free.  Here, as elsewhere, I am at the\r\nwill of God; He gave me all I have, and He can take it away whensoever He\r\npleases.  I served King Charles of blessed memory, and also the king, his\r\nson; and they recompensed me handsomely for my services.  I will abide\r\nthe judgment of the parliament of Paris touching what I have done\r\naccording to my king’s commands as to the affairs of the realm.”  He was\r\ntold that the people sent to look for him were hard by, and was asked,\r\n“Shall we open to them?”  “Why not?” was his reply.  He himself went to\r\nmeet them, and received them with a courtesy which they returned.  He was\r\nthen removed to Paris, where he was shut up with his colleagues in the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nTheir trial before parliament was prosecuted eagerly, especially in the\r\ncase of the absent De Clisson, whom a royal decree banished from the\r\nkingdom “as a false and wicked traitor to the crown, and condemned him to\r\n‘pay a hundred thousand marks of silver, and to forfeit forever the\r\noffice of constable.’”  It is impossible in the present day to estimate\r\nhow much legal justice there was in this decree; but, in any case, it was\r\ncertainly extreme severity to so noble and valiant a warrior who had done\r\nso much for the safety and honor of France.  The Dukes of Burgundy and\r\nBerry and many barons of the realm signed the decree; but the king’s\r\nbrother, the Duke of Orleans, refused to have any part in it.  Against\r\nthe other councillors of the king the prosecution was continued, with\r\nfits and starts of determination, but in general with slowness and\r\nuncertainty.  Under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, the\r\nparliament showed an inclination towards severity; but Bureau de la\r\nRiviere had warm friends, and amongst others, the young and beautiful\r\nDuchess of Berry, to whose marriage he had greatly contributed, and John\r\nJuvenal des Ursins, provost of the tradesmen of Paris, one of the men\r\ntowards whom the king and the populace felt the highest esteem and\r\nconfidence.  The king, favorably inclined towards the accused by his own\r\nbias and the influence of the Duke of Orleans, presented a demand to\r\nparliament to have the papers of the procedure brought to him. Parliament\r\nhesitated and postponed a reply; the procedure followed its course; and\r\nat the end of some months further the king ordered it to be stopped, and\r\nSires de la Riviere and Neviant to be set at liberty and to have their\r\nreal property restored to them, at the same time that they lost their\r\npersonal property and were commanded to remain forever at fifteen\r\nleagues’ distance, at least, from the court.  This was moral equity, if\r\nnot legal justice.  The accused had been able and faithful servants of\r\ntheir king and country.  Their imprisonment had lasted more than a year.\r\nThe Dukes of Burgundy and Berry remained in possession of power.\r\n\r\nThey exercised it for ten years, from 1392 to 1402, without any great\r\ndispute between themselves--the Duke of Burgundy’s influence being\r\npredominant--or with the king, who, save certain lucid intervals, took\r\nmerely a nominal part in the government.  During this period no event of\r\nimportance disturbed France internally.  In 1393 the King of England,\r\nRichard II., son of the Black Prince, sought in marriage the daughter of\r\nCharles VI., Isabel of France, only eight years old.  In both courts and\r\nin both countries there was a desire for peace.  An embassy came in state\r\nto demand the hand of the princess.  The ambassadors were presented, and\r\nthe Earl of Northampton, marshal of England, putting one knee to the\r\nground before her, said, “Madame, please God you shall be our sovereign\r\nlady and Queen of England.”  The young girl, well tutored, answered, “If\r\nit please God and my lord and father that I should be Queen of England, I\r\nwould be willingly, for I have certainly been told that I should then be\r\na great lady.”  The contract was signed on the 9th of March, 1396, with a\r\npromise that, when the princess had accomplished her twelfth year, she\r\nshould be free to assent to or refuse the union; and ten days after the\r\nmarriage, the king’s uncles and the English ambassadors mutually signed a\r\ntruce, which promised--but quite in vain--to last for eight and twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Sigismund, King of Hungary, threatened with an\r\ninvasion of his kingdom by the great Turkish Sultan Bajazet I., nicknamed\r\nLightning (El Derfr), because of his rapid conquests, invoked the aid of\r\nthe Christian kings of the West, and especially of the King of France.\r\nThereupon there was a fresh outbreak of those crusades so often renewed\r\nsince the end of the thirteenth century.  All the knighthood of France\r\narose for the defence of a Christian king.  John, Count of Nevers, eldest\r\nson of the Duke of Burgundy, scarcely eighteen years of age, said to his\r\ncomrades, “If it pleased my two lords, my lord the king and my lord and\r\nfather, I would willingly head this army and this venture, for I have a\r\ndesire to make myself known.”  The Duke of Burgundy consented, and, in\r\nperson, conducted his son to St. Denis, but without intending to make him\r\na knight as yet.  “He shall receive the accolade,” said he, “as a knight\r\nof Jesus Christ, at the first battle against the infidels.”  In April,\r\n1396, an army of new crusaders left France and traversed Germany\r\nuproariously, everywhere displaying its valiant ardor, presumptuous\r\nrecklessness, and chivalrous irregularity.  Some months elapsed without\r\nany news; but, at the beginning of December, there were seen arriving in\r\nFrance some poor creatures, half naked, dying of hunger, cold, and\r\nweariness, and giving deplorable accounts of the destruction of the\r\nFrench army.  The people would not believe them: “They ought to be thrown\r\ninto the water,” they said, “these scoundrels who propagate such lies.”\r\n But, on the 23th of December, there arrived at Paris James de Helly, a\r\nknight of Artois, who, booted and spurred, strode into the hostel of\r\nSt. Paul, threw himself on his knees before the king in the midst of the\r\nprinces, and reported that he had come straight from Turkey; that on the\r\n28th of the preceding September the Christian army had been destroyed at\r\nthe battle of Nicopolis; that most of the lords had been either slain in\r\nbattle or afterwards massacred by the sultan’s order; and that the Count\r\nof Nevers had sent him to the king and to his father the duke, to get\r\nnegotiations entered into for his release.  There was no exaggeration\r\nabout the knight’s story.  The battle had been terrible, the slaughter\r\nawful.  For the latter, the French, who were for a moment victorious, had\r\nset a cruel example with their prisoners; and Bajazet had surpassed them\r\nin cool ferocity.  After the first explosion of the father’s and the\r\npeople’s grief, the ransom of the prisoners became the topic.  It was a\r\nlarge sum, and rather difficult to raise; and, whilst it was being sought\r\nfor, James de Helly returned to report as much to Bajazet, and to place\r\nhimself once more in his power.  “Thou art welcome,” said the sultan;\r\n“thou hast loyally kept thy word; I give thee thy liberty; thou canst go\r\nwhither thou wiliest.”\r\n\r\nTerms of ransom were concluded; and the sum total was paid through the\r\nhands of Bartholomew Pellegrini, a Genoese trader.  Before the Count of\r\nNevers and his comrades set out, Bajazet sent for them.  “John,” said he\r\nto the count through an interpreter, “I know that thou art a great lord\r\nin thy country, and the son of a great lord.  Thou art young.  It may be\r\nthat thou art abashed and grieved at what hath befallen thee in thy first\r\nessay of knighthood, and that, to retrieve thine honor, thou wilt collect\r\na powerful army against me.  I might, ere I release thee, bind thee by\r\noath not to take arms against me, neither thyself nor thy people.  But\r\nno; I will not exact this oath either from them or from thee.  When thou\r\nhast returned yonder, take up arms if it please thee, and come and attack\r\nme.  Thou wilt find me ever ready to receive thee in the open field, thee\r\nand thy men-at-arms.  And what I say to thee, I say for the sake of all\r\nthe Christians thou mayest purpose to bring.  I fear them not; I was born\r\nto fight them, and to conquer the world.”  Everywhere and at all times\r\nhuman pride, with its blind arrogance, is the same.  Bajazet saw no\r\nglimpse of that future when his empire would be decaying, and held\r\ntogether only by the interested protection of Christian powers.  After\r\npaying dearly for their errors and their disasters, Count John of Nevers\r\nand his comrades in captivity re-entered France in February, 1398, and\r\ntheir expedition to Hungary was but one of the last vain ventures of\r\nchivalry in the great struggle that commenced in the seventh century\r\nbetween Islamry and Christendom.\r\n\r\nWhile this tragic incident was taking place in Eastern Europe, the court\r\nof the mad king was falling a victim to rivalries, intrigues, and\r\nscandals which, towards the close of this reign, were to be the curse and\r\nthe shame of France.  There had grown up between Queen Isabel of Bavaria\r\nand Louis, Duke of Orleans, brother of the king, an intimacy which,\r\nthroughout the city and amongst all honorable people, shocked even the\r\nleast strait-laced.  It was undoubtedly through the queen’s influence\r\nthat Charles VI., in 1402, suddenly decided upon putting into the hands\r\nof the Duke of Orleans the entire government of the realm and the right\r\nof representing him in everything during the attacks of his malady.  The\r\nDuke of Burgundy wrote at once about it to the parliament of Paris,\r\nsaying, “Take counsel and pains that the interests of the king and his\r\ndominion be not governed as they now are, for, in good truth, it is a\r\npity and a grief to hear what is told me about it.”  The accusation was\r\nnot grounded solely upon the personal ill-temper of the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nHis nephew, the Duke of Orleans, was elegant, affable, volatile,\r\ngood-natured; he had for his partisans at court all those who shared his\r\nworse than frivolous tastes and habits; and his political judgment was no\r\nbetter than his habits.  No sooner was he invested with power than he\r\nabused it strangely; he levied upon the clergy as well as the people an\r\nenormous talliage, and the use he made of the money increased still\r\nfurther the wrath of the public.  An Augustine monk, named James Legrand,\r\nalready celebrated for his writings, had the hardihood to preach even\r\nbefore the court against abuses of power and licentiousness of morals.\r\nThe king rose up from his own place, and went and sat down right opposite\r\nthe preacher.  “Yes, sir,” continued the monk, “the king your father,\r\nduring his reign, did likewise lay taxes upon the people, but with the\r\nproduce of them he built fortresses for the defence of the kingdom, he\r\nhurled back the enemy and took possession of their towns, and he effected\r\na saving of treasure which made him the most powerful amongst the kings\r\nof the West.  But now, there is nothing of this kind done; the height of\r\nnobility in the present day is to frequent bagnios, to live in\r\ndebauchery, to wear rich dresses with pretty fringes and big cuffs.\r\nThis, O queen,” he added, “is what is said to the shame of the court;\r\nand, if you will not believe me, put on the dress of some poor woman and\r\nwalk about the city, and you will hear it talked of by plenty of people.”\r\n In spite of his malady and his affection for his brother, Charles VI.,\r\neither from pure feebleness or because he was struck by those truths so\r\nboldly proclaimed, yielded to the counsels of certain wise men who\r\nrepresented to him “that it was neither a reasonable nor an honorable\r\nthing to intrust the government of the realm to a prince whose youth\r\nneeded rather to be governed than to govern.”  He withdrew the direction\r\nof affairs from the Duke of Orleans and restored it to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, who took it again and held it with a strong grasp, and did\r\nnot suffer his nephew Louis to meddle in anything.  But from that time\r\nforward open distrust and hatred were established between the two princes\r\nand their families.  In the very midst of this court-crisis Duke Philip\r\nthe Bold fell ill and died within a few days, on the 27th of April, 1404.\r\nHe was a prince valiant and able, ambitious, imperious, eager in the\r\npursuit of his own personal interests, careful in humoring those whom he\r\naspired to rule, and disposed to do them good service in whatever was not\r\nopposed to his own ends.  He deserved and possessed the confidence and\r\naffection not only of his father, King John, but also of his brother,\r\nCharles V., a good judge of wisdom and fidelity.  He founded that great\r\nhouse of Burgundy which was for more than a century to eclipse and often\r\nto deplorably compromise France; but Philip the Bold loved France\r\nsincerely, and always gave her the chief place in his policy.  His\r\nprivate life was regular and staid, amidst the scandalous licentiousness\r\nof his court.  He was of those who leave behind them unfeigned regret and\r\nan honored memory, without having inspired their contemporaries with any\r\nlively sympathy.\r\n\r\nJohn the Fearless, Count of Nevers, his son and successor in the dukedom\r\nof Burgundy, was not slow to prove that there was reason to regret his\r\nfather.  His expedition to Hungary, for all its bad leadership and bad\r\nfortune, had created esteem for his courage and for his firmness under\r\nreverses, but little confidence in his direction of public affairs.  He\r\nwas a man of violence, unscrupulous and indiscreet, full of jealousy and\r\nhatred, and capable of any deed and any risk for the gratification of his\r\npassions or his fancies.  At his accession he made some popular moves; he\r\nappeared disposed to prosecute vigorously the war against England, which\r\nwas going on sluggishly; he testified a certain spirit of conciliation by\r\ngoing to pay a visit to his cousin, the Duke of Orleans, lying ill at his\r\ncastle of Beaute, near Vincennes; when the Duke of Orleans was well\r\nagain, the two princes took the communion together, and dined together at\r\ntheir uncle’s, the Duke of Berry’s; and the Duke of Orleans invited the\r\nnew Duke of Burgundy to dine with him the next Sunday.  The Parisians\r\ntook pleasure in observing these little matters, and in hoping for the\r\nre-establishment of harmony in the royal family.  They were soon to be\r\ncruelly undeceived.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of November, 1407, the Duke of Orleans had dined at Queen\r\nIsabel’s.  He was returning about eight in the evening along Vieille Rue\r\ndu Temple, singing and playing with his glove, and attended by only two\r\nsquires riding one horse, and by four or five varlets on foot, carrying\r\ntorches.  It was a gloomy night; not a soul in the streets.  When the\r\nduke was about a hundred paces from the queen’s hostel, eighteen or\r\ntwenty armed men, who had lain in ambush behind a house called Image de\r\nNotre-Dame, dashed suddenly out; the squires’ horse took fright and ran\r\naway with them; and the assassins rushed upon the duke, shouting, “Death!\r\ndeath!”  “What is all this?” said he; “I am the Duke of Orleans.”  “Just\r\nwhat we want,” was the answer; and they hurled him down from his mule.\r\nHe struggled to his knees; but the fellows struck at him heavily with axe\r\nand sword.  A young man in his train made an effort to defend him, and\r\nwas immediately cut down; and another, grievously wounded, had but just\r\ntime to escape into a neighboring shop.  A poor cobbler’s wife opened her\r\nwindow, and, seeing the work of assassination, shrieked, “Murder!\r\nmurder!”  “Hold your tongue, you strumpet!” cried some one from the\r\nstreet.  Others shot arrows at the windows where lookers-on might be.  A\r\ntall man, wearing a red cap which came down over his eyes, said in a loud\r\nvoice, “Out with all lights, and away!” The assassins fled at the top of\r\ntheir speed, shouting, “Fire! fire!” throwing behind them foot-trippers,\r\nand by menaces causing all the lights to be put out which were being\r\nlighted here and there in the shops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Murder of the Duke of Orleans----38]\r\n\r\nThe duke was quite dead.  One of his squires, returning to the spot,\r\nfound his body stretched on the road, and mutilated all over.  He was\r\ncarried to the neighboring church of Blancs-Manteaux, whither all the\r\nroyal family came to render the last sad offices.  The Duke of Burgundy\r\nappeared no less afflicted than the rest.  “Never,” said he, “was a more\r\nwicked and traitorous murder committed in this realm.”  The provost of\r\nParis, Sire de Tignouville, set on foot an active search after the\r\nperpetrators.  He was summoned before the council of princes, and the\r\nDuke of Berry asked him if he had discovered anything.  “I believe,” said\r\nthe provost, “that if I had leave to enter all the hostels of the king’s\r\nservants, and even of the princes, I could get on the track of the\r\nauthors or accomplices of the crime.”  He was authorized to enter\r\nwherever it seemed good to him.  He went away to set himself to work.\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy, looking troubled and growing pale, “Cousin,” said\r\nthe King of Naples, Louis d’Anjou, who was present at the council, “can\r\nyou know aught about it?  You must tell us.”  The Duke of Burgundy took\r\nhim, together with his uncle, the Duke of Berry, aside, and told them\r\nthat it was he himself who, tempted of the devil, had given orders for\r\nthis murder.  “O God!” cried the Duke of Berry, “then I lose both my\r\nnephews!”  The Duke of Burgundy went out in great confusion, and the\r\ncouncil separated.  Research brought about the discovery that the crime\r\nhad been for a long while in preparation, and that a Norman nobleman,\r\nRaoul d’Auquetonville, late receiver-general of finance, having been\r\ndeprived of his post by the Duke of Orleans for malversation, had been\r\nthe instrument.  The council of princes met the next day at the Hotel de\r\nNesle.  The Duke of Burgundy, who had recovered all his audacity, came to\r\ntake his seat there.  Word was sent to him not to enter the room.  Duke\r\nJohn persisted; but the Duke of Berry went to the door and said to him,\r\n“Nephew, give up the notion of entering the council; you would not be\r\nseen there with pleasure.”  “I give up willingly,” answered Duke John;\r\n“and that none may be accused of putting to death the Duke of Orleans, I\r\ndeclare that it was I, and none other, who caused the doing of what has\r\nbeen done.”  Thereupon he turned his horse’s head, returned forthwith to\r\nthe Hotel d’Artois, and, taking only six men with him, he galloped\r\nwithout a halt, except to change horses, to the frontier of Flanders.\r\nThe Duke of Bourbon complained bitterly at the council that an immediate\r\narrest had not been ordered.  The Admiral de Brabant, and a hundred of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans’ knights, set out in pursuit, but were unable to come\r\nup in time.  Neither Raoul d’Anquetonville nor any other of the assassins\r\nwas caught.  The magistrates, as well as the public, were seized with\r\nstupor in view of so great a crime and so great a criminal.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of Orleans left a widow who, in spite of his infidelities\r\nand his irregularities, was passionately attached to him.  Valentine\r\nVisconti, the Duke of Milan’s daughter, whose dowry had gone to pay the\r\nransom of King John, was at Chateau-Thierry when she heard of her\r\nhusband’s murder.  Hers was one of those natures, full of softness and at\r\nthe same time of fire, which grief does not overwhelm, and in which a\r\npassion for vengeance is excited and fed by their despair.  She started\r\nfor Paris in the early part of December, 1407, during the roughest\r\nwinter, it was said, ever known for several centuries, taking with her\r\nall her children.  The Duke of Berry, the Duke of Bourbon, the Count of\r\nClermont, and the constable went to meet her.  Herself and all her train\r\nin deep mourning, she dismounted at the hostel of St. Paul, threw herself\r\non her knees before the king with the princes and council around him, and\r\ndemanded of him justice for her husband’s cruel death.  The chancellor\r\npromised justice in the name of the king, who added with his own lips,\r\n“We regard the deed relating to our own brother as done to ourself.”  The\r\ncompassion of all present was boundless, and so was their indignation;\r\nbut it was reported that the Duke of Burgundy was getting ready to return\r\nto Paris, and with what following and for what purpose would he come?\r\nNothing was known on that point.  There was no force with which to make a\r\ndefence.  Nothing was done for the Duchess of Orleans; no prosecution\r\nbegan.  As much vexed and irritated as disconsolate, she set out for\r\nBlois with her children, being resolved to fortify herself there.\r\nCharles had another relapse of his malady.  The people of Paris, who were\r\nrather favorable than adverse to the Duke of Burgundy, laid the blame of\r\nthe king’s new attack, and of the general alarm, upon the Duchess of\r\nOrleans, who was off in flight.  John the Fearless actually re-entered\r\nParis on the 20th of February, 1408, with a thousand men-at-arms, amidst\r\npopular acclamation, and cries of “Long live the Duke of Burgundy!”\r\n Having taken up a strong position at the Hotel d’Artois, he sent a demand\r\nto the king for a solemn audience, proclaiming his intention of setting\r\nforth the motives for which he had caused the Duke of Orleans to be\r\nslain.  The 8th of March was the day fixed.  Charles VI., being worse\r\nthan ever that day, was not present; the _dauphin_, Louis, Duke of\r\nGuienne, a child of twelve years, surrounded by the princes, councillors,\r\na great number of lords, doctors of the university, burgesses of note,\r\nand people of various conditions, took his father’s place at this\r\nassembly.  The Duke of Burgundy had intrusted a Norman Cordelier, Master\r\nJohn Petit, with his justification.  The monk spoke for more than five\r\nhours, reviewing sacred history, and the histories of Greece, Rome, and\r\nPersia, and the precedents of Phineas, Absalom the son of David, Queen\r\nAthaliah, and Julian the Apostate, to prove “that it is lawful, and not\r\nonly lawful, but honorable and meritorious, in any subject to slay or\r\ncause to be slain a traitor and disloyal tyrant, especially when he is a\r\nman of such mighty power that justice cannot well be done by the\r\nsovereign.”  This principle once laid down, John Petit proceeded to apply\r\nit to the Duke of Burgundy, “causing to be slain that criminal tyrant,\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, who was meditating the damnable design of thrusting\r\naside the king and his children from their crown;” and he drew from it\r\nthe conclusion that “the Duke of Burgundy ought not to be at all blamed\r\nor censured for what had happened in the person of the Duke of Orleans,\r\nand that the king not only ought not to be displeased with him, but ought\r\nto hold the said lord of Burgundy, as well as his deed, agreeable to him,\r\nand authorized by necessity.”  The defence thus concluded, letters were\r\nactually put before the king, running thus: “It is our will and pleasure\r\nthat our cousin of Burgundy, his heirs and successors, be and abide at\r\npeace with us and our successors, in respect of the aforesaid deed, and\r\nall that hath followed thereon; and that by us, our said successors, our\r\npeople and officers, no hinderance, on account of that, may be offered\r\nthem, either now or in time to come.”\r\n\r\nCharles VI., weak in mind and will, even independently of his attacks,\r\nsigned these letters, and gave Duke John quite a kind reception, telling\r\nhim, however, that “he could cancel the penalty, but not the resentment\r\nof everybody, and that it was for him to defend himself against perils\r\nwhich were probably imminent.”  The duke answered proudly that “so long\r\nas he stood in the king’s good graces, he did not fear any man living.”\r\n\r\nThree days after this strange audience and this declaration, Queen\r\nIsabel, but lately on terms of the closest intimacy with the Duke of\r\nOrleans, who had been murdered on his way home after dining with her, was\r\nfilled with alarm, and set off suddenly for Melun, taking with her her\r\nson Louis, the _dauphin_, and accompanied by nearly all the princes, who,\r\nhowever, returned before long to Paris, being troubled by the displeasure\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy testified at their departure.  For more than four\r\nmonths, Duke John the Fearless remained absolute master of Paris,\r\ndisposing of all posts, giving them to his own creatures, and putting\r\nhimself on good terms with the university and the principal burgesses.\r\nA serious revolt amongst the Liigese called for his presence in Flanders.\r\nThe first troops he had sent against them had been repulsed; and he felt\r\nthe necessity of going thither in person.  But two months after his\r\ndeparture from Paris, on the 26th of August, 1408, Queen Isabel returned\r\nthither from Melun, with the _dauphin_ Louis, who for the first time rode\r\non horseback, and with three thousand men-at-arms.  She set up her\r\nestablishment at the Louvre.  The Parisians shouted “Noel,” as she passed\r\nalong; and the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Bourbon, the Duke of Brittany,\r\nthe constable, and all the great officers of the crown rallied round her.\r\nTwo days afterwards, on the 28th of August, the Duchess of Orleans\r\narrived there from Blois, in a black litter drawn by four horses\r\ncaparisoned in black, and followed by a large number of mourning\r\ncarriages.  On the 5th of September, a state assembly was held at the\r\nLouvre.  All the royal family, the princes and great officers of the\r\ncrown, the presidents of the parliament, fifteen archbishops or bishops,\r\nthe provost of Paris, the provost of tradesmen, and a hundred burgesses\r\nof note attended it.  Thereupon Master Juvenal des Ursins, king’s\r\nadvocate, announced the intention of Charles VI. in his illness to confer\r\nthe government upon the queen, set forth the reasons for it, called to\r\nmind the able regency of Queen Blanche, mother of St. Louis, and produced\r\nroyal letters, sealed with the great seal.  Immediately the Duchess of\r\nOrleans came forward, knelt at the _dauphin_’s feet, demanding justice\r\nfor the death of her husband, and begged that she might have a day\r\nappointed her for refuting the calumnies with which it had been sought to\r\nblacken his memory.  The _dauphin_ promised a speedy reply.  On the 11th\r\nof September, accordingly, a new meeting of princes, lords, prelates,\r\nparliament, the university, and burgesses was held in the great hall of\r\nthe Louvre.  The Duchess of Orleans, the Duke her son, their chancellor,\r\nand the principal officers of her household were introduced, and leave\r\nwas given them to proceed with the justification of the late Duke of\r\nOrleans.  It had been prepared beforehand; the duchess placed the\r\nmanuscript before the council, as pledging herself unreservedly to all it\r\ncontained, and Master Serisy, Abbot of St. Fiacre, a monk of the order of\r\nSt. Benedict, read the document out publicly.  It was a long and learned\r\ndefence, in which the imputations made by the cordelier, John Petit,\r\nagainst the late Duke of Orleans, were effectually and in some parts\r\neloquently refuted.  After the justification, Master Cousinot, advocate\r\nof the Duchess of Orleans, presented in person his demands against the\r\nDuke of Burgundy.  They claimed that he should be bound to come, “without\r\nbelt or chaperon,” and disavow solemnly and publicly, on his knees before\r\nthe royal family, and also on the very spot where the crime was\r\ncommitted, the murder of the Duke of Orleans.  After several other acts\r\nof reparation which were imposed upon him, he was to be sent into exile\r\nfor twenty years beyond the seas, and on his return to remain at twenty\r\nleagues’ distance, at least, from the king and the royal family.  After\r\nreacting these demands, which were more legitimate than practicable, the\r\nyoung _dauphin_, well instructed as to what he had to say, addressed the\r\nDuchess of Orleans and her children in these terms: “We and all the\r\nprinces of the blood royal here present, after having heard the\r\njustification of our uncle, the Duke of Orleans, have no doubt left\r\ntouching the honor of his memory, and do hold him to be completely\r\ncleared of all that hath been said contrary to his reputation.  As to the\r\nfurther demands you make, they shall be suitably provided for in course\r\nof justice.”  At this answer the assembly broke up.\r\n\r\nIt had just been reported that the Duke of Burgundy had completely beaten\r\nand reduced to submission the insurgent Liegese, and that he was\r\npreparing to return to Paris with his army.  Great was the consternation\r\namongst the council of the queen and princes.  They feared above\r\neverything to see the king and the _dauphin_ in the Duke of Burgundy’s\r\npower; and it was decided to quit Paris, which had always testified a\r\nfavorable disposition towards Duke John.  Charles VI. was the first to\r\ndepart, on the 3d of November, 1408.  The queen, the _dauphin_, and the\r\nprinces followed him two days afterwards, and at Gien they all took boat\r\non the Loire to go to Tours.  The Duke of Burgundy on his arrival at\r\nParis, on the 28th of November, found not a soul belonging to the royal\r\nfamily or the court; and he felt a moment’s embarrassment.  Even his\r\naudacity and lack of scruple did not go to the extent of doing without\r\nthe king altogether, or even of dispensing with having him for a tool;\r\nand he had seen too much of the Parisian populace not to know how\r\nprecarious and fickle was its favor.  He determined to negotiate with the\r\nking’s party, and for that purpose he sent his brother-in-law the Count\r\nof Hainault, to Tours, with a brilliant train of unarmed attendants,\r\nbidden to make themselves agreeable, and not to fight.\r\n\r\nA recent event had probably much to do with his decision.  His most\r\nindomitable foe, she to whom the king and his councillors had lately\r\ngranted a portion of the vengeance she was seeking to take on him,\r\nValentine of Milan, Duchess of Orleans, died on the 4th of December,\r\n1408, at Blois, far from satisfied with the moral reparation she had\r\nobtained in her enemy’s absence, and clearly foreseeing that against the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, flushed with victory and present in person, she would\r\nobtain nothing of what she had asked.  For spirits of the best mettle,\r\nand especially for a woman’s heart, impotent passion is a heavy burden to\r\nbear; and Valentine Visconti, beautiful, amiable, and unhappy even in her\r\nbest days through the fault of the husband she loved, sank under this\r\ntrial.  At the close of her life she had taken for device, “Nought have I\r\nmore; more hold I nought” (Bien ne m ‘est plus; plus ne m ‘est rien);\r\nand so fully was that her habitual feeling that she had the words\r\ninscribed upon the black tapestry of her chamber.  In her last hours she\r\nhad by her side her three sons and her daughter, but there was another\r\nstill whom she remembered.  She sent for a child, six years of age, John,\r\na natural son of her husband by Marietta d’Enghien, wife of Sire de\r\nCany-Dunois.  “This one,” said she, “was filched from me; yet there is\r\nnot a child so well cut out as he to avenge his father’s death.”\r\n Twenty-five years later John was the famous Bastard of Orleans, Count\r\nDunois, Charles VII.’s lieutenant-general, and Joan of Arc’s comrade in\r\nthe work of saving the French kingship and France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Valentine de Milan----45]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy’s negotiations at Tours were not fruitless.  The\r\nresult was, that on the 9th of March, 1409, a treaty was concluded and an\r\ninterview effected at Chartres between the duke on one side and on the\r\nother the king, the queen, the _dauphin_, all the royal family, the\r\ncouncillors of the crown, the young Duke of Orleans, his brother, and a\r\nhundred knights of their house, all met together to hear the king declare\r\nthat he pardoned the Duke of Burgundy.  The duke prayed “my lord of\r\nOrleans and my lords his brothers to banish from their hearts all hatred\r\nand vengeance;” and the princes of Orleans “assented to what the king\r\ncommanded them, and forgave their cousin the Duke of Burgundy everything\r\nentirely.”  On the way back from Chartres the Duke of Burgundy’s fool\r\nkept playing with a church-paten (called “peace”), and thrusting it under\r\nhis cloak, saying, “See, this is a cloak of peace;” and, “Many folks,”\r\n says Juvenal des Ursins, “considered this fool pretty wise.”  The Duke of\r\nBurgundy had good reason, however, for seeking this outward\r\nreconciliation; it put an end to a position too extended not to become\r\npretty soon untenable; the peace was a cause of great joy at Paris; the\r\nking was not long coming back; and two hundred thousand persons, says the\r\nchronicle, went out to meet him, shouting, “Noel!” The Duke of Burgundy\r\nhad gone out to receive him; and the queen and the princes arrived two\r\ndays after-wards.  It was not known at the time, though it was perhaps\r\nthe most serious result of the negotiation, that a secret understanding\r\nhad been established between John the Fearless and Isabel of Bavaria.\r\nThe queen, as false as she was dissolute, had seen that the duke might be\r\nof service to her on occasion if she served him in her turn, and they had\r\nadded the falsehood of their undivulged arrangement to that of the\r\ngeneral reconciliation.\r\n\r\nBut falsehood does not extinguish the facts it attempts to disguise.  The\r\nhostility between the houses of Orleans and Burgundy could not fail to\r\nsurvive the treaty of Chartres, and cause search to be made for a man to\r\nhead the struggle so soon as it could be recommenced.  The hour and the\r\nman were not long waited for.  In the very year of the treaty, Charles of\r\nOrleans, eldest son of the murdered duke and Valentine of Milan, lost his\r\nwife, Isabel of France, daughter of Charles VI.; and as early as the\r\nfollowing year (1410) the princes, his uncles, made him marry Bonne\r\nd’Armagnac, daughter of Count Bernard d’Armagnac, one of the most\r\npowerful, the most able, and the most ambitious lords of Southern France.\r\nForthwith, in concert with the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Brittany, and\r\nseveral other lords, Count Bernard put himself at the head of the Orleans\r\nparty, and prepared to proceed against the Duke of Burgundy in the cause\r\nof dominion combined with vengeance.  From 1410 to 1415 France was a prey\r\nto civil war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, and to their\r\nalternate successes and reverses brought about by the unscrupulous\r\nemployment of the most odious and desperate means.  The Burgundians had\r\ngenerally the advantage in the struggle, for Paris was chiefly the centre\r\nof it, and their influence was predominant there.  Their principal allies\r\nthere were the butchers, the boldest and most ambitious corporation in\r\nthe city.  For a long time the butcher-trade of Paris had been in the\r\nhands of a score of families the number had been repeatedly reduced, and\r\nat the opening of the fifteenth century, three families, the Legoix, the\r\nSt. Yons, and the Thiberts, had exercised absolute mastery in the market\r\ndistrict, which in turn exercised mastery over nearly the whole city.\r\n“One Caboche, a flayer of beasts in the shambles of Hotel-Dieu, and\r\nMaster John de Troyes, a surgeon with a talent for speaking, were their\r\nmost active associates.  Their company consisted of ‘prentice-butchers,\r\nmedical students, skinners, tailors, and every kind of lewd fellows.\r\nWhen anybody caused their displeasure they said, ‘Here’s an Armagnac,’\r\nand despatched him on the spot, and plundered his house, or dragged him\r\noff to prison to pay dear for his release.  The rich burgesses lived in\r\nfear and peril.  More than three hundred of them went off to Melun with\r\nthe provost of tradesmen, who could no longer answer for the tranquillity\r\nof the city.”  The Armagnacs, in spite of their general inferiority,\r\nsometimes got the upper hand, and did not then behave with much more\r\ndiscretion than the others.  They committed the mistake of asking aid\r\nfrom the King of England, “promising him the immediate surrender of all\r\nthe cities, castles, and bailiwicks they still possessed in Guienne and\r\nPoitou.”  Their correspondence fell into the hands of the Burgundians,\r\nand the Duke of Burgundy showed the king himself a letter stating that\r\n“the Duke of Berry, the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of Bourbon had\r\nlately conspired together at Bourges for the destruction of the king, the\r\nkingdom, and the good city of Paris.”  “Ah!” cried the poor king with\r\ntears, “we quite see their wickedness, and we do conjure you, who are of\r\nour own blood, to aid and advise us against them.”  The duke and his\r\npartisans, kneeling on one knee, promised the king all the assistance\r\npossible with their persons and their property.  The civil war was\r\npassionately carried on.  The Burgundians went and besieged Bourges.  The\r\nsiege continued a long while without success.  Some of the besiegers grew\r\nweary of it.  Negotiations were opened with the besieged.  An interview\r\ntook place before the walls between the Duke of Berry and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy.  “Nephew,” said the former, “I have acted ill, and you still\r\nworse.  It is for us to try and maintain the kingdom in peace and\r\nprosperity.”  “I will be no obstacle, uncle,” answered Duke John.  Peace\r\nwas made.  It was stipulated that the Duke of Berry and the Armagnac\r\nlords should give up all alliance with the English, and all confederacy\r\nagainst the Duke of Burgundy, who, on his side, should give up any that\r\nhe might have formed against them.  An engagement was entered into\r\nmutually to render aid, service, and obedience to the king against his\r\nfoe of England, as they were bound by right and reason to do; and lastly\r\na promise was made to observe the articles of the peace of Chartres, and\r\nto swear them over again.  There was a special prohibition against using,\r\nfor the future, the words Armagnacs and Burgundians, or any other term\r\nreflecting upon either party.  The pacification was solemnly celebrated\r\nat Auxerre, on the 22d of August, 1412; and on the 29th of September\r\nfollowing, the _dauphin_ once more entered Paris, with the Duke of\r\nBurgundy at his side.  The king, queen, and Duke of Berry arrived a few\r\ndays afterwards.  The people gave a hearty reception to them, even to the\r\nArmagnacs, well known as such, in their train; but the butchers and the\r\nmen of their faction murmured loudly, and treated the peace as treason.\r\nOutside, it was little more than nominal; the Count of Armagnac remained\r\nunder arms and the Duke of Orleans held aloof from Paris.  A violent\r\nferment again began there.  The butchers continued to hold the mastery.\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy, all the while finding them very much in the way,\r\ndid not cease to pay court to them, Many of his knights were highly\r\ndispleased at seeing themselves mixed up with such fellows.  The honest\r\nburgesses began to be less frightened at the threats and more angry at\r\nthe excesses of the butchers.  The advocate-general, Juvenal des Ursins,\r\nhad several times called without being received at the Hotel d’Artois,\r\nbut one night the Duke of Burgundy sent for him, and asked him what he\r\nthought of the position.  “My lord,” said the magistrate, “do not persist\r\nin always maintaining that you did well to have the Duke of Orleans\r\nslain; enough mischief has come of it to make you agree that you were\r\nwrong.  It is not to your honor to let yourself be guided by flayers of\r\nbeasts and a lot of lewd fellows.  I can guarantee that a hundred\r\nburgesses of Paris, of the highest character, would undertake to attend\r\nyou everywhere, and do whatever you should bid them, and even lend you\r\nmoney if you wanted it.”  The duke listened patiently, but answered that\r\nhe had done no wrong in the case of the Duke of Orleans, and would never\r\nconfess that he had.  “As to the fellows of whom you speak,” said he,\r\n“I know my own business.”  Juvenal returned home without much belief in\r\nthe duke’s firmness.  He himself, full of courage as he was, durst not\r\nyet declare himself openly.  The thought of all this occupied his mind\r\nincessantly, sleeping and waking.  One night, when he had fallen asleep\r\ntowards morning, it seemed to him that a voice kept saying, _Surgite cum\r\nsederitis, qui manducatis panem doloris_ (Rise up from your sitting, ye\r\nwho eat the bread of sorrow).  When he awoke, his wife, a good and pious\r\nwoman, said to him, “My dear, this morning I heard some one saying to\r\nyou, or you pronouncing in a dream, some words that I have often read in\r\nmy Hours;” and she repeated them to him.  “My dear,” answered Juvenal,\r\n“we have eleven children, and consequently great cause to pray God to\r\ngrant us peace; let us hope in Him, and He will help us.”  He often saw\r\nthe Duke of Berry.  “Well, Juvenal,” the old prince would say to him,\r\n“shall this last forever?  Shall we be forever under the sway of these\r\nlewd fellows?”  “My lord,” Juvenal would answer, “hope we in God; yet a\r\nlittle while and we shall see them confounded and destroyed.”\r\n\r\nNor was Juvenal mistaken.  The opposition to the yoke of the Burgundians\r\nwas daily becoming more and more earnest and general.  The butchers\r\nattempted to stein the current; but the carpenters took sides against\r\nthem, saying, “We will see which are the stronger in Paris, the hewers of\r\nwood or the fellers of oxen.”  The parliament, the exchequer-chamber, and\r\nthe Hotel-de-Ville demanded peace; and the shouts of Peace! peace!\r\nresounded in the streets.  A great crowd of people assembled on the\r\nGreve; and thither the butchers came with their company of about twelve\r\nhundred persons, it is said.  They began to speak against peace, but\r\ncould not get a hearing.  “Let those who are for it go to the right,”\r\n shouted a voice, “and those who are against it to the left!” But the\r\nadversaries of peace durst not risk this test.  The Duke of Burgundy\r\ncould not help seeing that he was declining rapidly; he was no longer\r\nsummoned to the king’s council; a watch was kept upon his house; and he\r\ndetermined to go away.  On the 23d of August, 1413, without a word said,\r\neven to his household, he went away to the wood of Vincennes, prevailing\r\non the king to go hawking with him.  There was a suspicion that the duke\r\nmeant to carry off the king.  Juvenal des Ursins, with a company of armed\r\nburgesses, hurried off to Vincennes, and going straight to the king,\r\nsaid, “Sir, come away to Paris; it is too hot to be out.”  The king\r\nturned to go back to the city.  The Duke of Burgundy was angry, saying\r\nthat the king was going a-hawking.  “You would take him too far,”\r\n rejoined Juvenal; “your people are in travelling dress, and you have\r\nyour trumpeters with you.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John the Fearless----51]\r\n\r\nThe duke took leave of the king, said business required his presence in\r\nFlanders, and went off as fast as he could.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known that he had gone, there was a feeling of regret and\r\ndisquietude amongst the sensible and sober burgesses at Paris.  What they\r\nwanted was peace; and in order to have it the adherence of the Duke of\r\nBurgundy was indispensable.  Whilst he was present, there might be hope\r\nof winning him or forcing him over to it; but, whilst he was absent,\r\nheadstrong as he was known to be, a renewal of war was the most probable\r\ncontingency.  And this result appeared certain when it was seen how the\r\nprinces hostile to the Duke of Burgundy, above all, Duke Charles of\r\nOrleans, the Count of Armagnac and their partisans hastened back to\r\nParis, and resumed their ascendency with the king and in his council.\r\nThe _dauphin_, Louis Duke of Aquitaine, united himself by the ties of\r\nclose friendship with the Duke of Orleans, and prevailed upon him to give\r\nup the mourning he had worn since his father’s murder; the two princes\r\nappeared everywhere dressed alike; the scarf of Armagnac re-placed that\r\nof Burgundy; the feelings of the populace changed as the fashion of the\r\ncourt; and when children sang in the streets the song but lately in\r\nvogue, “Burgundy’s duke, God give thee joy!” they were struck and hurled\r\nto the ground.  Facts were before long in accordance with appearances.\r\nAfter a few pretences of arrangement the Duke of Burgundy took up arms\r\nand marched on Paris.  Charles VI., on his side, annulled, in the\r\npresence of Parliament, all acts adverse to the Duke of Orleans and his\r\nadherents; and the king, the queen, and the _dauphin_ bound themselves by\r\noath not to treat with the duke of Burgundy until they had destroyed his\r\npower.  At the end of March, 1414, the king’s army was set in motion;\r\nCompiegne, Soissons, and Bapaume, which held out for the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, were successively taken by assault or surrendered; the royal\r\ntroops treated the people as vanquished rebels; and the four great\r\ncommunes of Flanders sent a deputation to the king to make protestations\r\nof their respect and an attempt to arrange matters between their lord and\r\nhis suzerain.  Animosity was still too lively and too recent in the\r\nking’s camp to admit of satisfaction with a victory as yet incomplete.\r\nOn the 28th of July began the siege of Arras; but after five weeks the\r\nbesiegers had made no impression; an epidemic came upon them; the Duke of\r\nBavaria and the constable, Charles d’Albret, were attacked by it;\r\nweariness set in on both sides; the Duke of Burgundy’ himself began to be\r\nanxious about his position; and he sent the Duke of Brabant, his brother,\r\nand the Countess of Hainault, his sister, to the king and the _dauphin_,\r\nwith more submissive words than he had hitherto deigned to utter.  The\r\nCountess of Hainault, pleading the ties of family and royal interests,\r\nmanaged to give the _dauphin_ a bias towards peace; and the _dauphin_ in\r\nhis turn worked upon the mind of the king, who was becoming more and more\r\nfeeble and accessible to the most opposite impressions.  It was in vain\r\nthat the most intimate friends of the Duke of Orleans tried to keep the\r\nking steadfast in his wrath from night to morning.  One day, when he was\r\nstill in bed, one of them softly approaching and putting his hand under\r\nthe coverlet, said, plucking him by the foot, “My lord, are you asleep?”\r\n “No, cousin,” answered the king; “you are quite welcome; is there\r\nanything new?”  “No, sir; only that your people report that if you would\r\nassault Arras there would be good hope of effecting an entry.”  “But if\r\nmy cousin of Burgundy listens to reason, and puts the town into my hands\r\nwithout assault, we will make peace.”  “What! sir; you would make peace\r\nwith this wicked, this disloyal man who so cruelly had your brother\r\nslain?”  “But all was forgiven him with the consent of my nephew of\r\nOrleans,” said the king mournfully.  “Alas! sir, you will never see that\r\nbrother again.”  “Let me be, cousin,” said the king, impatiently; “I\r\nshall see him again on the day of judgment.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this stubborn way of working up the irreconcilable\r\nenmities which caused divisions in the royal family, peace was decided\r\nupon and concluded at Arras, on the 4th of September, 1414, on conditions\r\nas vague as ever, which really put no end to the causes of civil war, but\r\npermitted the king on the one hand and the Duke of Burgundy on the other,\r\nto call themselves and to wear an appearance of being reconciled.  A\r\nserious event which happened abroad at that time was heavily felt in\r\nFrance, reawakened the spirit of nationality, and opened the eyes of all\r\nparties a little to the necessity of suspending their own selfish\r\ndisagreements.  Henry IV., King of England, died on the 20th of March,\r\n1413.  Having been chiefly occupied with the difficulties of his own\r\ngovernment at home, he, without renouncing the war with France, had not\r\nprosecuted it vigorously, and had kept it in suspense or adjournment by a\r\nrepetition of truces.  Henry V., his son and successor, a young prince of\r\nfive and twenty, active, ambitious, able, and popular, gave, from the\r\nvery moment of his accession, signs of having bolder views, which were\r\nnot long coming to maturity, in respect of his relations with France.\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy had undoubtedly anticipated them, for, as soon as he\r\nwas cognizant of Henry IV.’s death, he made overtures in London for the\r\nmarriage of his daughter Catherine with the new King of England, and he\r\nreceived at Bruges an English embassy on the subject.  When this was\r\nknown at Paris, the council of Charles VI. sent to the Duke of Burgundy\r\nSire de Dampierre and the Bishop of Evreux bearing letters to him from\r\nthe king “which forbade him, on pain of forfeiture and treason, to enter\r\ninto any treaty with the King of England, either for his daughter’s\r\nmarriage or for any other cause.”  But the views of Henry V. soared\r\nhigher than a marriage with a daughter of the Duke of Burgundy.  It was\r\nto the hand of the King of France’s daughter, herself also named\r\nCatherine, that he made pretension, flattering himself that he would find\r\nin this union aid in support of his pretences to the crown of France.\r\nThese pretences he put forward, hardly a year after his accession to the\r\nthrone, basing them, as Edward III. had done, on the alleged right of\r\nIsabel of France, wife of Edward II., to succeed King John.  No reply was\r\nvouchsafed from Paris to this demand.  Only the Princess Catherine, who\r\nwas but thirteen, was presented to the envoys of the King of England, and\r\nshe struck them as being tall and beautiful.  A month later, in August,\r\n1414, Henry V. gave Charles VI. to understand that he would be content\r\nwith a strict execution of the treaty of Bretigny, with the addition of\r\nNormandy, Anjou, and Maine, and the hand of the Princess Catherine with a\r\ndowry of two million crowns.  The war between Charles VI. and John the\r\nFearless caused a suspension of all negotiations on this subject; but,\r\nafter the peace of Arras, in January, 1415, a new and solemn embassy from\r\nEngland arrived at Paris, and the late proposals were again brought\r\nforward.  The ambassadors had a magnificent reception; splendid presents\r\nand entertainments were given them; but no answer was made to their\r\ndemands; they were only told that the King of France was about to send an\r\nembassy to the King of England.  It did not set out before the 27th of\r\nthe following April; the Archbishop of Bourges, the most eloquent prelate\r\nin the council, was its spokesman; and it had orders to offer the King of\r\nEngland the hand of the Princess Catherine with a dowry of eight hundred\r\nand forty thousand golden crowns, besides fifteen towns in Aquitaine and\r\nthe seneschalty of Limoges.  Henry V. rejected these offers, declaring\r\nthat, if he did not get Normandy and all the districts ceded by the\r\ntreaty of Bretigny, he would have recourse to war to recover a crown\r\nwhich belonged to him.  To this arrogant language the Archbishop of\r\nBourges replied, “O king, what canst thou be thinking of that thou\r\nwouldst fain thus oust the King of the French, our lord, the most noble\r\nand excellent of Christian kings, from the throne of so powerful a\r\nkingdom?  Thinkest thou that it is for fear of thee and of the English\r\nthat he hath made thee an offer of his daughter together with so great a\r\nsum and a portion of his land?  Nay, verily; he was moved by pity and the\r\nlove of peace; he would not that the innocent blood should be spilt and\r\nChristian people destroyed in the hurly-burly of battle.  He will invoke\r\nthe aid of God Almighty, of the blessed virgin Mary, and of all the\r\nsaints.  Then by his own arms and those of his loyal subjects, vassals,\r\nand allies, thou wilt be driven from his kingdom, and, peradventure, meet\r\nwith death or capture.”\r\n\r\nOn returning to Paris the ambassadors, in presence of the king’s council\r\nand a numerous assembly of clergy, nobility, and people, gave an account\r\nof their embassy and advised instant preparation for war without\r\nlistening to a single word of peace.  “They loudly declared,” says the\r\nmonk of St. Denis, “that King Henry’s letters, though they were\r\napparently full of moderation, had lurking at the bottom of them a great\r\ndeal of perfidy, and that this king, all the time that he was offering\r\npeace and union in the most honeyed terms, was thinking only how he might\r\ndestroy the kingdom, and was levying troops in all quarters.”  Henry V.,\r\nindeed, in November, 1414, demanded of his Parliament a large subsidy,\r\nwhich was at once voted without any precise mention of the use to be made\r\nof it, and merely in the terms following: “For the defence of the realm\r\nof England and the security of the seas.”  At the commencement of the\r\nfollowing year, Henry resumed negotiations with France, renouncing his\r\nclaims to Normandy, Anjou, and Maine; but Charles VI. and his council\r\nadhered to their former offers.  On the 16th of April, 1415, Henry\r\nannounced to a grand council of spiritual and temporal peers, assembled\r\nat Westminster, his determination “of setting out in person to go and, by\r\nGod’s grace, recover his heritage.”  He appointed one of his brothers,\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, to be regent in his absence, and the peers,\r\necclesiastical and laical, applauded his design, promising him their\r\nsincere co-operation.  Thus France, under a poor mad king and amidst\r\ncivil dissensions of the most obstinate character, found the question\r\nrenewed for her of French versus English king-ship and national\r\nindependence versus foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of August, 1415, an English fleet, having on board, together\r\nwith King Henry V., six thousand men-at-arms, twenty-four thousand\r\narchers, powerful war-machines, and a multitude of artisans and “small\r\nfolk,” came to land near Harfleur, not far from the mouth of the Seine.\r\nIt was the most formidable expedition that had ever issued from the ports\r\nof England.  The English spent several days in effecting their landing\r\nand setting up their siege-train around the walls of the city.  “It would\r\nhave been easy,” says the monk of St. Denis, “to hinder their operations,\r\nand the inhabitants of the town and neighborhood would have worked\r\nthereat with zeal, if they had not counted that the nobility of the\r\ndistrict and the royal army commanded by the constable, Charles d’Albret,\r\nwould come to their aid.”  No one came.  The burgesses and the small\r\ngarrison of Harfleur made a gallant defence; but, on the 22d of\r\nSeptember, not receiving from Vernon, where the king and the _dauphin_\r\nwere massing their troops, any other assistance than the advice to “take\r\ncourage and trust to the king’s discretion,” they capitulated; and Henry\r\nV., after taking possession of the place, advanced into the country with\r\nan army already much reduced by sickness, looking for a favorable point\r\nat which to cross the Somme and push his invasion still farther.  It was\r\nnot until the 19th of October that he succeeded, at Bethencourt, near St.\r\nQuentin.  Charles VI., who at that time had a lucid interval, after\r\nholding at Rouen a council of war, at which it was resolved to give the\r\nEnglish battle, wished to repair with the _dauphin_, his son, to Bapaume,\r\nwhere the French army had taken position; but his uncle, the Duke of\r\nBerry, having still quite a lively recollection of the battle of\r\nPoitiers, fought fifty-nine’ years before, made opposition, saying,\r\n“Better lose the battle than the king and the battle.”  All the princes\r\nof the royal blood and all the flower of the French nobility, except the\r\nking and his three sons, and the Dukes of Berry, Brittany, and Burgundy,\r\njoined the army.  The Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, and the Constable\r\nd’Albret, who was in command, sent to ask the King of England on what day\r\nand at what place he would be pleased to give them battle.  “I do not\r\nshut myself up in walled towns,” replied Henry; “I shall be found at any\r\ntime and any where ready to fight, if any attempt be made to cut off my\r\nmarch.”  The French resolved to stop him between Agincourt and\r\nFramecourt, a little north of St. Paul and Hesdin.  The encounter took\r\nplace on the 25th of October, 1415.  It was a monotonous and lamentable\r\nrepetition of the disasters of Crecy and Poitiers; disasters almost\r\ninevitable, owing to the incapacity of the leaders and ever the same\r\ndefects on the part of the French nobility, defects which rendered their\r\nvalorous and generous qualities not only fruitless, but fatal.  Never had\r\nthat nobility been more numerous and more brilliant than in this\r\npremeditated struggle.  On the eve of the battle, Marshal de Boucicaut\r\nhad armed five hundred new knights; the greater part passed the night on\r\nhorse-back, under arms, on ground soaked with rain; and men and horses\r\nwere already distressed in the morning, when the battle began.  It were\r\ntedious to describe the faulty manoeuvres of the French army and their\r\ndeplorable consequences on that day.  Never was battle more stubborn or\r\ndefeat more complete and bloody.  Eight thousand men of family, amongst\r\nwhom were a hundred and twenty lords bearing their own banners, were left\r\non the field of battle.  The Duke of Brabant, the Count of Nevers, the\r\nDuke of Bar, the Duke of Alencon, and the Constable d’Albret were killed.\r\nThe Duke of Orleans was dragged out wounded from under the dead.  When\r\nHenry V., after having spent several hours on the field of battle,\r\nretired to his quarters, he was told that the Duke of Orleans would\r\nneither eat nor drink.  He went to see him.  “What fare, cousin?” said\r\nhe.  “Good, my lord.”  “Why will you not eat or drink?” “I wish to fast.”\r\n “Cousin,” said the king, gently, “make good cheer: if God has granted me\r\ngrace to gain the victory, I know it is not owing to my deserts; I\r\nbelieve that God wished to punish the French; and, if all I have heard\r\nis true, it is no wonder, for they say that never were seen disorder,\r\nlicentiousness, sins, and vices like what is going on in France just now.\r\nSurely, God did well to be angry.”  It appears that the King of England’s\r\nfeeling was that also of many amongst the people of France.  “On\r\nreflecting upon this cruel mishap,” says the monk of St. Denis, “all the\r\ninhabitants of the kingdom, men and women, said, ‘In what evil days are\r\nwe come into this world that we should be witnesses of such confusion and\r\nshame!’”  During the battle the eldest son of Duke John the Fearless, the\r\nyoung Count of Charolais (at that time nineteen), who was afterwards\r\nPhilip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was at the castle of Aire, where his\r\ngovernors kept him by his father’s orders and prevented him from joining\r\nthe king’s army.  His servants were leaving him one after another to go\r\nand defend the kingdom against the English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Already distressed----57]\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of the disaster at Agincourt he was seized with profound\r\ndespair at having failed in that patriotic duty; he would fain have\r\nstarved himself to death, and he spent three whole days in tears, none\r\nbeing able to comfort him.  When, four years afterwards, he became Duke\r\nof Burgundy, and during his whole life, he continued to testify his keen\r\nregret at not having fought in that cruel battle, though it should have\r\ncost him his life, and he often talked with his servants about that event\r\nof grievous memory.  When his father, Duke John, received the news of the\r\ndisaster at Agincourt, he also exhibited great sorrow and irritation; he\r\nhad lost by it his two brothers, the Duke of Brabant and the Count of\r\nNevers; and he sent forthwith a herald to the King of England, who was\r\nstill at Calais, with orders to say, that in consequence of the death of\r\nhis brother, the Duke of Brabant, who was no vassal of France, and held\r\nnothing in fief there, he, the Duke of Burgundy, did defy him mortally\r\n(fire and sword) and sent him his gauntlet.  “I will not accept the\r\ngauntlet of so noble and puissant a prince as the Duke of Burgundy,” was\r\nHenry V.’s soft answer; “I am of no account compared with him.  If I have\r\nhad the victory over the nobles of France, it is by God’s grace.  The\r\ndeath of the Duke of Brabant hath been an affliction to me; but I do\r\nassure thee that neither I nor my people did cause his death.  Take back\r\nto thy master his gauntlet; if he will be at Boulogne on the 15th of\r\nJanuary next, I will prove to him by the testimony of my prisoners and\r\ntwo of my friends, that it was the French who accomplished his brother’s\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy, as a matter of course, let his quarrel with the\r\nKing of England drop, and occupied himself for the future only in\r\nrecovering his power in France.  He set out on the march for Paris,\r\nproclaiming everywhere that he was assembling his army solely for the\r\npurpose of avenging the kingdom, chastising the English, and aiding the\r\nking with his counsels and his forces.  The sentiment of nationality was\r\nso strongly aroused that politicians most anxious about their own\r\npersonal interests, and about them alone, found themselves obliged to pay\r\nhomage to it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was, so far as Duke John was concerned, only a\r\nsuperficial and transitory homage.  There is no repentance so rarely seen\r\nas that of selfishness in pride and power.  The four years which elapsed\r\nbetween the battle of Agincourt and the death of John the Fearless were\r\nfilled with nothing but fresh and still more tragic explosions of hatred\r\nand strife between the two factions of the Burgundians and Armagnacs,\r\ntaking and losing, re-taking and re-losing, alternately, their ascendency\r\nwith the king and in the government of France.  When, after the battle of\r\nAgincourt, the Duke of Burgundy marched towards Paris, he heard almost\r\nsimultaneously that the king was issuing a prohibition against the entry\r\nof his troops, and that his rival, the Count of Armagnac, had just\r\narrived and been put in possession of the military power, as constable,\r\nand of the civil power, as superintendent-general of finance.  The duke\r\nthen returned to Burgundy, and lost no time in recommencing hostilities\r\nagainst the king’s government.  At one time he let his troops make war on\r\nthe king’s and pillage the domains of the crown; at another he entered\r\ninto negotiations with the King of England, and showed a disposition to\r\nadmit his claims to such and such a province, and even perhaps to the\r\nthrone of France.  He did not accede to the positive alliance offered him\r\nby Henry; but he employed the fear entertained of it by the king’s\r\ngovernment as a weapon against his enemies.  The Count of Armagnac, on\r\nhis side, made the most relentless use of power against the Duke of\r\nBurgundy and his partisans; he pursued them everywhere, especially in\r\nParis, with dexterous and pitiless hatred.  He abolished the whole\r\norganization and the privileges of the Parisian butcherdom which had\r\nshown so favorable a leaning towards Duke John; and the system he\r\nestablished as a substitute was founded on excellent grounds appertaining\r\nto the interests of the people and of good order in the heart of Paris;\r\nbut the violence of absolute power and of hatred robs the best measures\r\nof the credit they would deserve if they were more disinterested and\r\ndispassionate.  A lively reaction set in at Paris in favor of the\r\npersecuted Burgundians; even outside of Paris several towns of\r\nimportance, Rheims, Chalons, Troyes, Auxerre, Amiens, and Rouen itself,\r\nshowed a favorable disposition towards the Duke of Burgundy, and made a\r\nsort of alliance with him, promising to aid him “in reinstating the king\r\nin his freedom and lordship, and the realm in its freedom and just\r\nrights.”  The Count of Armagnac was no more tender with the court than\r\nwith the populace of Paris.  He suspected, not without reason, that the\r\nqueen, Isabel of Bavaria, was in secret communication with and gave\r\ninformation to Duke John.  Moreover, she was leading a scandalously\r\nlicentious life at Vincennes; and one of her favorites, Louis de\r\nBosredon, a nobleman of Auvergne and her steward, meeting the king one\r\nday on the road, greeted the king cavalierly and hastily went his way.\r\nCharles VI. was plainly offended.  The Count of Armagnac seized the\r\nopportunity; and not only did he foment the king’s ill-humor, but talked\r\nto him of all the irregularities of which the queen was the centre, and\r\nin which Louis de Bosredon was, he said, at that time her principal\r\naccomplice.  Charles, in spite of the cloud upon his mind, could hardly\r\nhave been completely ignorant cf such facts; but it is not necessary to\r\nbe a king to experience extreme displeasure on learning that offensive\r\nscandals are almost public, and on hearing the whole tale of them.  The\r\nking, carried away by his anger, went straight to Vincennes, had a\r\nviolent scene with his wife, and caused Bosredon to be arrested,\r\nimprisoned, and put to the question; and he, on his own confession it is\r\nsaid, was thrown into the Seine, sewn up in a leathern sack, on which\r\nwere inscribed the words, “Let the king’s justice run its course!”\r\n Charles VI. and Armagnac did not stop there.  Queen Isabel was first of\r\nall removed from the council and stripped of all authority, and then\r\nbanished to Tours, where commissioners were appointed to watch over her\r\nconduct, and not to let her even write a letter without their seeing it.\r\nBut royal personages can easily elude such strictness.  A few months\r\nafter her banishment, whilst the despotism of Armagnac and the war\r\nbetween the king and the Duke of Burgundy were still going on, Queen\r\nIsabel managed to send to the duke, through one of her servants, her\r\ngolden seal, which John the Fearless well knew, with a message to the\r\neffect that she would go with him if he would come to fetch her.  On the\r\nnight of November 1, 1417, the Duke of Burgundy hurriedly raised the\r\nsiege of Corbeil, advanced with a body of troops to a position within two\r\nleagues from Tours, and sent the queen notice that he was awaiting her.\r\nIsabel ordered her three custodians to go with her to mass at the Convent\r\nof Marmoutier, outside the city.  Scarcely was she within the church when\r\na Burgundian captain, Hector de Saveuse, presented himself with sixty men\r\nat the door.  “Look to your safety, madame,” said her custodians to\r\nIsabel; “here is a large company of Burgundians or English.”  “Keep close\r\nto me,” replied the queen.  Hector de Saveuse at that moment entered and\r\nsaluted the queen on behalf of the Duke of Burgundy.  “Where is he?”\r\n asked the queen.  “He will not be long coming.”  Isabel ordered the\r\ncaptain to arrest her three custodians; and two hours afterwards Duke\r\nJohn arrived with his men-at-arms.  “My dearest cousin,” said the queen\r\nto him, “I ought to love you above every man in the realm; you have left\r\nall at my bidding, and are come to deliver me from prison.  Be assured\r\nthat I will never fail you.  I quite see that you have always been\r\ndevoted to my lord, his family, the realm, and the common-weal.”  The\r\nduke carried the queen off to Chartres; and as soon as she was settled\r\nthere, on the 12th of November, 1417, she wrote to the good towns of the\r\nkingdom,\r\n\r\n“We, Isabel, by the grace of God Queen of France, having, by reason of my\r\nlord the king’s seclusion, the government and administration of this\r\nrealm, by irrevocable grant made to us by the said my lord the king and\r\nhis council, are come to Chartres in company with our cousin, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, in order to advise and ordain whatsoever is necessary to\r\npreserve and recover the supremacy of my lord the king, on advice taken\r\nof the prud’hommes, vassals, and subjects.”\r\n\r\nShe at the same time ordered that Master Philip de Morvilliers,\r\nheretofore councillor of the Duke of Burgundy, should go to Amiens,\r\naccompanied by several clerics of note and by a registrar, and that there\r\nshould be held there, by the queen’s authority, for the bailiwicks of\r\nAmiens, Vermandois, Tournai, and the countship of Ponthieu, a sovereign\r\ncourt of justice, in the place of that which there was at Paris.  Thus,\r\nand by such a series of acts of violence and of falsehoods, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, all the while making war on the king, surrounded himself with\r\nhollow forms of royal and legal government.\r\n\r\nWhilst civil war was thus penetrating to the very core of the kingship,\r\nforeign war was making its way again into the kingdom.  Henry V., after\r\nthe battle of Agincourt, had returned to London, and had left his army to\r\nrepose and reorganize after its sufferings and its losses.  It was not\r\nuntil eighteen months afterwards, on the 1st of August, 1417, that he\r\nlanded at Touques, not far from Honfleur, with fresh troops, and resumed\r\nhis campaign in France.  Between 1417 and 1419 he successively laid siege\r\nto nearly all the towns of importance in Normandy, to Caen, Bayeux,\r\nFalaise, Evreux, Coutances, Laigle, St. Lo, Cherbourg, &c., &c.  Some\r\nhe occupied after a short resistance, others were sold to him by their\r\ngovernors; but when, in the month of July, 1418, he undertook the siege\r\nof Rouen, he encountered there a long and serious struggle.  Rouen had at\r\nthat time, it is said, a population of one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nsouls, which was animated by ardent patriotism.  The Rouennese, on the\r\napproach of the English, had repaired their gates, their ramparts, and\r\ntheir moats; had demanded re-enforcements from the King of France and the\r\nDuke of Burgundy; and had ordered every person incapable of bearing arms\r\nor procuring provisions for ten months, to leave the city.  Twelve\r\nthousand old men, women, and children were thus expelled, and died either\r\nround the place or whilst roving in misery over the neighboring country;\r\n“poor women gave birth unassisted beneath the walls, and good\r\ncompassionate people in the town drew up the new-born in baskets to have\r\nthem baptized, and afterwards lowered them down to their mothers to die\r\ntogether.”  Fifteen thousand men of city-militia, four thousand regular\r\nsoldiers, three hundred spearmen and as many archers from Paris, and it\r\nis not quite known how many men-at-arms sent by the Duke of Burgundy,\r\ndefended Rouen for more than five months amidst all the usual sufferings\r\nof strictly-besieged cities.  “As early as the beginning of October,”\r\n says Monstrelet, “they were forced to eat horses, dogs, cats, and other\r\nthings not fit for human beings;” but they nevertheless made frequent\r\nsorties, “rushing furiously upon the enemy, to whom they caused many a\r\nheavy loss.”  Four gentlemen and four burgesses succeeded in escaping and\r\ngoing to Beauvais, to tell the king and his council about the deplorable\r\ncondition of their city.  The council replied that the king was not in a\r\ncondition to raise the siege, but that Rouen would be relieved “within”\r\n on the fourth day after Christmas.  It was now the middle of December.\r\nThe Rouennese resigned themselves to waiting a fortnight longer; but,\r\nwhen that period was over, they found nothing arrive but a message from\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy recommending them “to treat for their preservation\r\nwith the King of England as best they could.”  They asked to capitulate.\r\nHenry V. demanded that “all the men of the town should place themselves\r\nat his disposal.”  “When the commonalty of Rouen heard this answer, they\r\nall cried out that it were better to die all together sword in hand\r\nagainst their enemies than place themselves at the disposal of yonder\r\nking, and they were for shoring up with planks a loosened layer of the\r\nwall inside the city, and, having armed themselves and joined all of them\r\ntogether, men, women, and children, for setting fire to the city,\r\nthrowing down the said layer of wall into the moats, and getting them\r\ngone by night whither it might please God to direct them.”  Henry V. was\r\nunwilling to confront such heroic despair; and on the 13th of January,\r\n1419, he granted the Rouennese a capitulation, from which seven persons\r\nonly were excepted, Robert Delivet, the archbishop’s vicar-general, who\r\nfrom the top of the ramparts had excommunicated the foreign conqueror;\r\nD’Houdetot, baillie of the city; John Segneult, the mayor; Alan\r\nBlanchard, the captain of the militia-crossbowmen, and three other\r\nburgesses.  The last-named, the hero of the siege, was the only one who\r\npaid for his heroism with his life; the baillie, the mayor, and the vicar\r\nbought themselves off.  On the 19th of January, at midday, the English,\r\nking and army, made their solemn entry into the city.  It was two hundred\r\nand fifteen years since Philip Augustus had won Rouen by conquest from\r\nJohn Lackland, King of England; and happily his successors were not to be\r\ncondemned to deplore the loss of it very long.\r\n\r\nThese successes of the King of England were so many reverses and perils\r\nfor the Count of Armagnac.  He had in his hands Paris, the king, and the\r\n_dauphin_; in the people’s eyes the responsibility of government and of\r\nevents rested on his shoulders; and at one time he was doing nothing,\r\nat another he was unsuccessful in what he did.  Whilst Henry V. was\r\nbecoming master of nearly all the towns of Normandy, the constable, with\r\nthe king in his army, was besieging Senlis; and he was obliged to raise\r\nthe siege.  The legates of Pope Martin V. had set about establishing\r\npeace between the Burgundians and Armagnacs, as well as between France\r\nand England; they had prepared, on the basis of the treaty of Arras, a\r\nnew treaty, with which a great part of the country, and even of the\r\nburgesses of Paris, showed themselves well pleased; but the constable had\r\nit rejected on the ground of its being adverse to the interests of the\r\nking and of France; and his friend, the chancellor, Henry de Marle,\r\ndeclared that, if the king were disposed to sign it, he would have to\r\nseal it himself, for that, as for him, the chancellor, he certainly would\r\nnot seal it.  Bernard of Armagnac and his confidential friend, Tanneguy\r\nDuchatel, a Breton nobleman, provost of Paris, were hard and haughty.\r\nWhen a complaint was made to them of any violent procedure, they would\r\nanswer, “What business had you there?  If it were the Burgundians, you\r\nwould make no complaint.”  The Parisian population was becoming every day\r\nmore Burgundian.  In the latter days of May.  1418, a plot was contrived\r\nfor opening to the Burgundians one of the gates of Paris.  Perrinet\r\nLeclerc, son of a rich iron-merchant having influence in the quarter of\r\nSt. Germain des Pros, stole the keys from under the bolster of his\r\nfather’s bed; a troop of Burgundian men-at-arms came in, and they were\r\nimmediately joined by a troop of Parisians.  They spread over the city,\r\nshouting, “Our Lady of peace!  Hurrah for the king!  Hurrah for Burgundy!\r\nLet all who wish for peace take arms and follow us!” The people swarmed\r\nfrom the houses and followed them accordingly.  The Armagnacs were\r\nsurprised and seized with alarm.  Tanneguy Duchatel, a man of prompt and\r\nresolute spirit, ran to the _dauphin_’s, wrapped him in his bed-clothes,\r\nand carried him off to the Bastille, where he shut him up with several of\r\nhis partisans.  The Count of Armagnac, towards whose house the multitude\r\nthronged, left by a back-door, and took refuge at a mason’s, where he\r\nbelieved himself secure.  In a few hours the Burgundians were masters of\r\nParis.  Their chief, the lord of Isle-Adam, had the doors of the hostel\r\nof St. Paul broken in, and presented himself before the king.  “How fares\r\nmy cousin of Burgundy?” said Charles VI.; “I have not seen him for some\r\ntime.”  That was all he said.  He was set on horseback and marched\r\nthrough the streets.  He showed no astonishment at anything; he had all\r\nbut lost memory as well as reason, and no longer knew the difference\r\nbetween Armagnac and Burgundian.  A devoted Burgundian, Sire Guy de Bar,\r\nwas named provost of Paris in the place of Tanneguy Duchatel.  The mason\r\nwith whom Bernard of Armagnac had taken refuge went and told the new\r\nprovost that the constable was concealed at his house.  Thither the\r\nprovost hurried, made the constable mount behind him, and carried him off\r\nto prison at the Chatelet, at the same time making honorable exertions to\r\nprevent massacre and plunder.\r\n\r\nBut factions do not so soon give up either their vengeance or their\r\nhopes.  On the 11th of June, 1418, hardly twelve days after Paris had\r\nfallen into the hands of the Burgundians, a body of sixteen hundred men\r\nissued from the Bastille, and rushed into the street St. Antoine,\r\nshouting, “Hurrah for the king, the _dauphin_, and the Count of Armagnac!”\r\n They were Tanneguy Duchatel and some of the chiefs of the Armagnacs who\r\nwere attempting to regain Paris, where they had observed that the\r\nBurgundians were not numerous.  Their attempt had no success, and merely\r\ngave the Burgundians the opportunity and the signal for a massacre of\r\ntheir enemies.  The little band of Tanneguy Duchatel was instantly\r\nrepulsed, hemmed in, and forced to re-enter the Bastille with a loss of\r\nfour hundred men.  Tanneguy saw that he could make no defence there; so\r\nhe hastily made his way out, taking the _dauphin_ with him to Melun.  The\r\nmassacre of the Armagnacs had already commenced on the previous evening:\r\nthey were harried in the hostelries and houses; they were cut down with\r\naxes in the streets.  On the night between the 12th and 13th of June a\r\nrumor spread about that there were bands of Armagnacs coming to deliver\r\ntheir friends in prison.  “They are at the St. Germain gate,” said some.\r\nNo, it is the St. Marceau gate,” said others.  The mob assembled and made\r\na furious rush upon the prison-gates.  “The city and burgesses will have\r\nno peace,” was the general saying, “so long as there is one Armagnac\r\nleft!  Hurrah for peace!  Hurrah for the Duke of Burgundy!”  The provost\r\nof Paris, the lord of Isle-Adam, and the principal Burgundian chieftains,\r\ngalloped up with a thousand horse, and strove to pacify these madmen,\r\nnumbering, it is said, some forty thousand.  They were received with a\r\nstout of, “A plague of your justice and pity!  Accursed be he whosoever\r\nshall have pity on these traitors of Armagnacs.  They are English; they\r\nare hounds.  They had already made banners for the King of England, and\r\nwould fain have planted them upon the gates of the city.  They made us\r\nwork for nothing, and when we asked for our due they said, ‘You rascals,\r\nhaven’t ye a sou to buy a cord and go hang yourselves?  In the devil’s\r\nname speak no more of it; it will be no use, whatever you say.’”  The\r\nprovost of Paris durst not oppose such fury as this.  “Do what you\r\nplease,” said he.  The mob ran to look for the constable Armagnac and the\r\nchancellor de Marle in the Palace-tower, in which they had been shut up,\r\nand they were at once torn to pieces amidst ferocious rejoicings.  All\r\nthe prisons were ransacked and emptied; the prisoners who attempted\r\nresistance were smoked out; they were hurled down from the windows upon\r\npikes held up to catch them.  The massacre lasted from four o’clock in\r\nthe morning to eleven.  The common report was, that fifteen hundred\r\npersons had perished in it; the account rendered to parliament made the\r\nnumber eight hundred.  The servants of the Duke of Burgundy mentioned to\r\nhim no more than four hundred.\r\n\r\nIt was not before the 14th of July that he, with Queen Isabel, came back\r\nto the city; and he came with a sincere design, if not of punishing the\r\ncut-throats, at least of putting a stop to all massacre and pillage; but\r\nthere is nothing more difficult than to suppress the consequences of a\r\nmischief of which you dare not attack the cause.  One Bertrand, head of\r\none of the companies of butchers, had been elected captain of St. Denis\r\nbecause he had saved the abbey from the rapacity of a noble Burgundian\r\nchieftain, Hector de Saveuse.  The lord, to avenge himself, had the\r\nbutcher assassinated.  The burgesses went to the duke to demand that the\r\nassassin should be punished; and the duke, who durst neither assent nor\r\nrefuse, could only partially cloak his weakness by imputing the crime to\r\nsome disorderly youngsters whom he enabled to get away.  On the 20th of\r\nAugust an angry mob collected in front of the Chatelet, shouting out that\r\nnobody would bring the Armagnacs to justice, and that they were every day\r\nbeing set at liberty on payment of money.  The great and little Chatelet\r\nwere stormed, and the prisoners massacred.  The mob would have liked to\r\nserve the Bastille the same; but the duke told the rioters that he would\r\ngive the prisoners up to them if they would engage to conduct them to the\r\nChatelet without doing them any harm, and, to win them over, he grasped\r\nthe hand of their head man, who was no other than Capeluche, the city\r\nexecutioner.  Scarcely had they arrived at the court-yard of the little\r\nChatelet when the prisoners were massacred there without any regard for\r\nthe promise made to the duke.  He sent for the most distinguished\r\nburgesses, and consulted them as to what could be done to check such\r\nexcesses; but they confined themselves to joining him in deploring them.\r\nHe sent for the savages once more, and said to them, “You would do far\r\nbetter to go and lay siege to Montlhery, to drive off the king’s enemies,\r\nwho have come ravaging everything up to the St. Jacques gate, and\r\npreventing the harvest from being got in.”  “Readily,” they answered,\r\n“only give us leaders.”  He gave them leaders, who led six thousand of\r\nthem to Montlhery.  As soon as they were gone Duke John had Capeluche and\r\ntwo of his chief accomplices brought to trial, and Capeluche was beheaded\r\nin the market-place by his own apprentice.  But the gentry sent to the\r\nsiege of Montlhery did not take the place; they accused their leaders of\r\nhaving betrayed them, and returned to be a scourge to the neighborhood of\r\nParis, everywhere saying that the Duke of Burgundy was the most\r\nirresolute man in the kingdom, and that if there were no nobles the war\r\nwould be ended in a couple of months.  Duke John set about negotiating\r\nwith the _dauphin_ and getting him back to Paris.  The _dauphin_ replied\r\nthat he was quite ready to obey and serve his mother as a good son\r\nshould, but that it would be more than he could stomach to go back to a\r\ncity where so many crimes and so much tyranny had but lately been\r\npractised.  Terms of reconciliation were drawn up and signed on the 16th\r\nof September, 1418, at St. Maur, by the queen, the Duke of Burgundy, and\r\nthe pope’s legates; but the _dauphin_ refused to ratify them.  The\r\nunpunished and long-continued massacres in Paris had redoubled his\r\ndistrust towards the Duke of Burgundy; he had, moreover, just assumed the\r\ntitle of regent of the kingdom; and he had established at Poitiers a\r\nparliament, of which Juvenal des Ursins was a member.  He had promised\r\nthe young Count of Armagnac to exact justice for his father’s cruel\r\ndeath; and the old friends of the house of Orleans remained faithful to\r\ntheir enmities.  The Duke of Burgundy had at one time to fight, and at\r\nanother to negotiate with the _dauphin_ and the King of England, both at\r\nonce, and always without success.  The _dauphin_ and his council, though\r\nshowing a little more discretion, were going on in the same alternative\r\nand unsatisfactory condition.  Clearly neither France and England nor the\r\nfactions in France had yet exhausted their passions or their powers; and\r\nthe day of summary vengeance was nearer than that of real reconciliation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, complicated, disturbed and persistently resultless\r\nsituations always end by becoming irksome to those who are entangled in\r\nthem, and by inspiring a desire for extrication.  The King of England, in\r\nspite of his successes and his pride, determined upon sending the Earl of\r\nWarwick to Provins, where the king and the Duke of Burgundy still were: a\r\ntruce was concluded between the English and the Burgundians, and it was\r\narranged that on the 30th of May, 1419, the two kings should meet between\r\nMantes and Melun, and hold a conference for the purpose of trying to\r\narrive at a peace.  A few days before the time, Duke John set out from\r\nProvins with the king, Queen Isabel, and Princess Catherine, and repaired\r\nfirst of all to Pontoise, and then to the place fixed for the interview,\r\non the borders of the Seine, near Meulan, where two pavilions had been\r\nprepared, one for the King of France and the other for the King of\r\nEngland.  Charles VI., being ill, remained at Pontoise.  Queen Isabel,\r\nPrincess Catherine, and the Duke of Burgundy arrived at the appointed\r\nspot.  Henry V. was already there; he went to meet the queen, saluted\r\nher, took her hand, and embraced her and Madame Catherine as well; Duke\r\nJohn slightly bent his knee to the king, who raised him up and embraced\r\nhim likewise.  This solemn interview was succeeded by several others to\r\nwhich Princess Catherine did not come.  The queen requested the King of\r\nEngland to state exactly what he proposed; and he demanded the execution\r\nof the treaty of Bretigny, the cession of Normandy, and the absolute\r\nsovereignty, without any bond of vassalage, of whatever should be ceded\r\nby the treaty.  A short discussion ensued upon some secondary questions.\r\nThere appeared to be no distant probability of an understanding.  The\r\nEnglish believed that they saw an inclination on the Duke of Burgundy’s\r\npart not to hasten to a conclusion, and to obtain better conditions from\r\nKing Henry by making him apprehensive of a reconciliation with the\r\n_dauphin_.  Henry proposed to him, for the purpose of ending everything,\r\na conference between themselves alone; and it took place on the 3d of\r\nJune.  “Cousin,” said the king to the duke, “we wish you to know that we\r\nwill have your king’s daughter, and all that we have demanded with her;\r\nelse we will thrust him out of his kingdom, and you too.”  “Sir,”\r\n answered the duke, “you speak according to your pleasure; but before\r\nthrusting my lord and myself from the kingdom you will have what will\r\ntire you, we make no doubt, and you will have enough to do to keep\r\nyourself in your own island.”  Between two princes so proud there was\r\nlittle probability of an understanding; and they parted with no other\r\nresult than mutual displeasure.\r\n\r\nSome days before, on the 14th of May, 1419, a truce of three months had\r\nbeen concluded between the _dauphin_ and the Duke of Burgundy, and was to\r\nlead to a conference also between these two princes.  It did not commence\r\nbefore the 8th of July.  During this interval, Duke John had submitted\r\nfor the mature deliberation of his council the question whether it were\r\nbetter to grant the English demands, or become reconciled to the\r\n_dauphin_.  Amongst his official councillors opinions were divided; but,\r\nin his privacy, the lady of Giac, “whom he loved and trusted mightily,”\r\n and Philip Jossequin, who had at first been his chamber attendant, and\r\nafterwards custodian of his jewels and of his privy seal, strongly urged\r\nhim to make peace with the _dauphin_; and the pope’s fresh legate, the\r\nBishop of Laon, added his exhortations to these home influences.  There\r\nhad been fitted up at a league’s distance from Melun, on the embankment\r\nof the ponds of Vert, a summer-house of branches and leaves, hung with\r\ndrapery and silken stuffs; and there the first interview between the two\r\nprinces took place.  The _dauphin_ left in displeasure; he had found the\r\nDuke of Burgundy haughty and headstrong.  Already the old servants of the\r\nlate Duke of Orleans, impelled by their thirst for vengeance, were saying\r\nout loud that the matter should be decided by arms, when the lady of Giac\r\nwent after the _dauphin_, who from infancy had also been very much\r\nattached to her, and she, going backwards and forwards between the two\r\nprinces, was so affectionate and persuasive with both that she prevailed\r\nupon them to meet again, and to sincerely wish for an understanding.  The\r\nnext day but one they returned to the place of meeting, attended, each of\r\nthem, by a large body of men-at-arms.  They advanced towards one another\r\nwith ten men only, and dismounted.  The Duke of Burgundy went on bended\r\nknee.  The _dauphin_ took him by the hand, embraced him, and would have\r\nraised him up.  “No, my lord,” said the duke; “I know how I ought to\r\naddress you.”  The _dauphin_ assured him that he forgave every offence,\r\nif indeed he had received any, and added, “Cousin, if in the proposed\r\ntreaty between us there be aught which is not to your liking, we desire\r\nthat you amend it, and henceforth we will desire all you shall desire;\r\nmake no doubt of it.”  They conversed for some time with every appearance\r\nof cordiality; and then the treaty was signed.  It was really a treaty of\r\nreconciliation, in which, without dwelling upon “the suspicions and\r\nimaginings which have been engendered in the hearts of ourselves and many\r\nof our officers, and have hindered us from acting with concord in the\r\ngreat matters of my lord the king and his kingdom, and resisting the\r\ndamnable attempts of his and our old enemies,” the two princes made\r\nmutual promises, each in language suitable to their rank and connection,\r\n“to love one another, support one another, and serve one another\r\nmutually, as good and loyal relatives, and bade all their servants, if\r\nthey saw any hinderance thereto, to give them notice thereof, according\r\nto their bounden duty.”  The treaty was signed by all the men of note\r\nbelonging to the houses of both princes; and the crowd which surrounded\r\nthem shouted “Noel!” and invoked curses on whosoever should be minded\r\nhenceforth to take up arms again in this damnable quarrel.  When the\r\n_dauphin_ went away, the duke insisted upon holding his stirrup, and they\r\nparted with every demonstration of amity.  The _dauphin_ returned to\r\nTouraine, and the duke to Pontoise, to be near the king, who, by letters\r\nof July 19, confirmed the treaty, enjoined general forgetfulness of the\r\npast, and ordained that “all war should cease, save against the English.”\r\n\r\nThere was universal and sincere joy.  The peace fulfilled the\r\nrequirements at the same time of the public welfare and of national\r\nfeeling; it was the only means of re-establishing order at home, and\r\ndriving from the kingdom the foreigner who aspired to conquer it.  Only\r\nthe friends of the Duke of Orleans, and of the Count of Armagnac, one\r\nassassinated twelve years before, and the other massacred but lately,\r\nremained sad and angry at not having yet been able to obtain either\r\njustice or vengeance; but they maintained reserve and silence.  They were\r\nnot long in once more finding for mistrust and murmuring grounds or\r\npretexts which a portion of the public showed a disposition to take up.\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy had made haste to publish his ratification of the\r\ntreaty of reconciliation; the _dauphin_ had let his wait.  The Parisians\r\nwere astounded not to see either the _dauphin_ or the Duke of Burgundy\r\ncoming back within their walls, and at being, as it were, forgotten and\r\ndeserted amidst the universal making-up.  They complained that no armed\r\nforce was being collected to oppose the English, and that there was an\r\nappearance of flying before them, leaving open to them Paris, in which at\r\nthis time there was no captain of renown.  They were still more troubled\r\nwhen, on the 29th of July, they saw the arrival at the St. Denis gate of\r\na multitude of disconsolate fugitives, some wounded, and others dropping\r\nfrom hunger, thirst, and fatigue.  When they were asked who they were,\r\nand what was the reason of their desperate condition, “We are from\r\nPontoise,” they said; “the English took the town this morning; they\r\nkilled or wounded all before them; happy he whosoever could escape from\r\ntheir hands; never were Saracens so cruel to Christians as yonder folk\r\nare.”  It was a real fact.  The King of England, disquieted at the\r\nreconciliation between the Duke of Burgundy and the _dauphin_, and at the\r\nill success of his own proposals at the conference of the 30th of May\r\npreceding, had vigorously resumed the war, in order to give both the\r\nreunited French factions a taste of his resolution and power.  He had\r\nsuddenly attacked and carried Pontoise, where the command was in the\r\nhands of the lord of Isle-Adam, one of the most valiant Burgundian\r\nofficers.  Isle-Adam, surprised and lacking sufficient force, had made a\r\nfeeble resistance.  There was no sign of an active union on the part of\r\nthe two French factions for the purpose of giving the English battle.\r\nDuke John, who had fallen back upon Troyes, sent order upon order for his\r\nvassals from Burgundy, but they did not come up.  Public alarm and\r\ndistrust were day by day becoming stronger.  Duke John, it was said, was\r\nstill keeping up secret communications with the seditious in Paris and\r\nwith the King of England; why did he not act with more energy against\r\nthis latter, the common enemy?  The two princes in their conference of\r\nJuly 9, near Melun, had promised to meet again; a fresh interview\r\nappeared necessary in order to give efficacy to their reconciliation.\r\nDuke John was very pressing for the _dauphin_ to go to Troyes, where the\r\nking and queen happened to be. The _dauphin_ on his side was earnestly\r\nsolicited by the most considerable burgesses of Paris to get this\r\ninterview over in order to insure the execution of the treaty of peace\r\nwhich had been sworn to with the Duke of Burgundy.  The _dauphin_ showed\r\na disposition to listen to these entreaties.  He advanced as far as\r\nMontereau in order to be ready to meet Duke John as soon as a place of\r\nmeeting should be fixed.\r\n\r\nDuke John hesitated, from irresolution even more than from distrust.  It\r\nwas a serious matter for him to commit himself more and more, by his own\r\nproper motion, against the King of England and his old allies amongst the\r\npopulace of Paris.  Why should he be required to go in person to seek the\r\n_dauphin_?  It was far simpler, he said, for Charles to come to the king\r\nhis father.  Tanneguy Duchatel went to Troyes to tell the duke that the\r\n_dauphin_ had come to meet him as far as Montereau, and, with the help of\r\nthe lady of Giae, persuaded on his side, to Bray-sur-Seine, two leagues\r\nfrom Montereau.  When the two princes had drawn thus near, their agents\r\nproposed that the interview should take place on the very bridge of\r\nMontereau, with the precautions and according to the forms decided on.\r\nIn the duke’s household many of his most devoted servants were opposed\r\nto this interview; the place, they said, had been chosen by and would be\r\nunder the ordering of the _dauphin_’s people, of the old servants of the\r\nDuke of Orleans and the Count of Armagnac.  At the same time four\r\nsuccessive messages came from Paris urging the duke to make the plunge;\r\nand at last he took his resolution.  “It is my duty,” said he, “to risk\r\nmy person in order to get at so great a blessing as peace.  Whatever\r\nhappens, my wish is peace.  If they kill me, I shall die a martyr.  Peace\r\nbeing made, I will take the men of my lord the _dauphin_ to go and fight\r\nthe English.  He has some good men of war and some sagacious captains.\r\nTanneguy and Barbazan are valiant knights.  Then we shall see which is\r\nthe better man, Jack (Hannotin) of Flanders or Henry of Lancaster.”  He\r\nset out for Bray on the 10th of September, 1419, and arrived about two\r\no’clock before Montereau.  Tanneguy Duchatel came and met him there.\r\n“Well,” said the duke, “on your assurance we are come to see my lord the\r\n_dauphin_, supposing that he is quite willing to keep the peace between\r\nhimself and us, as we also will keep it, all ready to serve him according\r\nto his wishes.”  “My most dread lord,” answered Tanneguy, “have ye no\r\nfear; my lord is well pleased with you, and desires henceforth to govern\r\nhimself according to your counsels.  You have about him good friends who\r\nserve you well.”  It was agreed that the _dauphin_ and the duke should,\r\neach from his own side, go upon the bridge of Montereau, each with ten\r\nmen-at-arms, of whom they should previously forward a list.  The\r\n_dauphin_’s people had caused to be constructed at the two ends of the\r\nbridge strong barriers closed by a gate; about the centre of the bridge\r\nwas a sort of lodge made of planks, the entrance to which was, on either\r\nside, through a pretty narrow passage; within the lodge there was no\r\nbarrier in the middle to separate the two parties.  Whilst Duke John and\r\nhis confidants, in concert with the _dauphin_’s people, were regulating\r\nthese material arrangements, a chamber-attendant ran in quite scared,\r\nshouting out, “My lord, look to yourself; without a doubt you will be\r\nbetrayed.”  The duke turned towards Tanneguy, and said, “We trust\r\nourselves to your word; in God’s holy name, are you quite sure of what\r\nyou have told us?  For you would do ill to betray us.”  “My most dread\r\nlord,” answered Tanneguy, “I would rather be dead than commit treason\r\nagainst you or any other: have ye no fear; I certify you that my lord\r\nmeaneth you no evil.”  “Very well, we will go then, trusting in God and\r\nyou,” re-joined the duke; and he set out walking to the bridge.  On\r\narriving at the barrier on the castle side he found there to receive him\r\nSire de Beauveau and Tanneguy Duchatel.  “Come to my lord,” said they;\r\n“he is awaiting you.”  “Gentlemen,” said the duke, “you see how I come;”\r\n and he showed them that he and his people had only their swords; then\r\nclapping Tanneguy on the shoulder, he said, “Here is he in whom I trust,”\r\n and advanced towards the _dauphin_, who remained standing, on the town\r\nside, at the end of the lodge constructed in the middle of the bridge.\r\nOn arriving at the prince’s presence Duke John took off his velvet cap\r\nand bent his knee to the ground.  “My lord,” said he, “after God, my duty\r\nis to obey and serve you; I offer to apply thereto and employ therein my\r\nbody, my friends, my allies, and well-wishers.  Say I well?” he added,\r\nfixing his eyes on the _dauphin_.  “Fair cousin,” answered the prince,\r\n“you say so well that none could say better; rise and be covered.”\r\n Conversation thereupon ensued between the two princes.  The _dauphin_\r\ncomplained of the duke’s delay in coming to see him: “For eighteen days,”\r\n he said, “you have made us await your coming in this place of Montereau,\r\nthis place a prey to epidemic and mortality, at the risk of and probably\r\nwith an eye to our personal danger.”  The duke, surprised and troubled,\r\nresumed his haughty and exacting tone: “We can neither do nor advise\r\naught,” said he, “save in your father’s presence; you must come thither.”\r\n “I shall go when I think proper,” said Charles, “and not at your will and\r\npleasure; it is well known that whatever we do, we two together, the king\r\nwill be content therewith.”  Then he reproached the duke with his\r\ninertness against the English, with the capture of Pontoise, and with his\r\nalliances amongst the promoters of civil war.  The conversation was\r\nbecoming more and more acrid and biting.  “In so doing,” added the\r\n_dauphin_, “you were wanting to your duty.”  “My lord,” replied the duke,\r\n“I did only what it was my duty to do.”  “Yes, you were wanting,”\r\n repeated Charles.  “No,” replied the duke.  It was probably at these\r\nwords that, the lookers-on also waxing wroth, Tanneguy Duchatel told the\r\nduke that the time had come for expiating the murder of the Duke of\r\nOrleans, which none of them had forgotten, and raised his battle-axe to\r\nstrike the duke.  Sire de Navailles, who happened to be at his master’s\r\nside, arrested the weapon; but, on the other hand, the Viscount of\r\nNarbonne raised his over Navailles, saying, “Whoever stirs is a dead\r\nman.”  At this moment, it is said, the mob which was thronging before the\r\nbarriers at the end of the bridge heard cries of “Alarm! slay, slay.”\r\n Tanneguy had struck and felled the duke; several others ran their swords\r\ninto him; and he expired.  The _dauphin_ had withdrawn from the scene and\r\ngone back into the town.  After his departure his partisans forced the\r\nbarrier, charged the dumbfounded Burgundians, sent them flying along the\r\nroad to Bray, and returning on to the bridge would have cast the body of\r\nDuke John, after stripping it, into the river; but the minister of\r\nMontereau withstood them, and had it carried to a mill near the bridge.\r\n“Next day he was put in a pauper’s shell, with nothing on but his shirt\r\nand drawers, and was subsequently interred at the church of Notre-Dame de\r\nMontereau, without winding-sheet and without pall over his grave.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘“Into the River!”’----77]\r\n\r\nThe enmities of the Orleannese and the Armagnacs had obtained\r\nsatisfaction; but they were transferred to the hearts of the Burgundians.\r\nAfter twelve years of public crime and misfortune the murder of Louis of\r\nOrleans had been avenged; and should not that of John of Burgundy be, in\r\nits turn?  Wherever the direct power or the indirect influence of the\r\nDuke of Burgundy was predominant, there was a burst of indignation and\r\nvindictive passion.  As soon as the Count of Charolais, Philip,\r\nafterwards called the Good, heard at Ghent, where he happened at that\r\ntime to be, of his father’s murder, he was proclaimed Duke of Burgundy.\r\n“Michelle,” said he to his wife, sister of the _dauphin_, Charles, “your\r\nbrother has murdered my father.”  The princess burst into tears; but the\r\nnew duke calmed her by saying that nothing could alter the love and\r\nconfidence he felt towards her.  At Troyes Queen Isabel showed more anger\r\nthan any one else against her son, the _dauphin_; and she got a letter\r\nwritten by King Charles VI. to the dowager Duchess of Burgundy, begging\r\nher, her and her children, “to set in motion all their relatives,\r\nfriends, and vassals to avenge Duke John.”  At Paris, on the 12th of\r\nSeptember, the next day but one after the murder, the chancellor, the\r\nparliament, the provost royal, the provost of tradesmen, and all the\r\ncouncillors and officers of the king assembled, “together with great\r\nnumber of nobles and burgesses and a great multitude of people,” who all\r\nswore “to oppose with their bodies and all their might the enterprise of\r\nthe criminal breakers of the peace, and to prosecute the cause of\r\nvengeance and reparation against those who were guilty of the death and\r\nhomicide of the late Duke of Burgundy.”  Independently of party-passion,\r\nsuch was, in Northern and Eastern France, the general and spontaneous\r\nsentiment of the people.  The _dauphin_ and his councillors, in order to\r\nexplain and justify their act, wrote in all directions to say that,\r\nduring the interview, Duke John had answered the _dauphin_ “with mad\r\nwords .  .  .  He had felt for his sword in order to attack and outrage\r\nour person, the which, as we have since found out, he aspired to place in\r\nsubjection .  .  .  but, through his own madness, met death instead.”\r\n But these assertions found little credence, and one of the two knights\r\nwho were singled out by the _dauphin_ to accompany him on to the bridge\r\nof Montereau, Sire de Barbazan, who had been a friend of the Duke of\r\nOrleans and of the Count of Armagnac, said vehemently to the authors of\r\nthe plot, “You have destroyed our master’s honor and heritage, and I\r\nwould rather have died than be present at this day’s work, even though I\r\nhad not been there to no purpose.”  But it was not long before an event,\r\neasy to foresee, counterbalanced this general impression and restored\r\ncredit and strength to the _dauphin_ and his party.  Henry V., King of\r\nEngland, as soon as he heard about the murder of Duke John, set himself\r\nto work to derive from it all the advantages he anticipated.  “A great\r\nloss,” said he, “is the Duke of Burgundy; he was a good and true knight\r\nand an honorable prince; but through his death we are by God’s help at\r\nthe summit of our wishes.  We shall thus, in spite of all Frenchmen,\r\npossess Dame Catherine, whom we have so much desired.”  As early as the\r\n24th of September, 1419, Henry V. gave full powers to certain of his\r\npeople to treat “with the illustrious city of Paris and the other towns\r\nin adherence to the said city.”  On the 17th of October was opened at\r\nArras a congress between the plenipotentiaries of England and those of\r\nBurgundy.  On the 20th of November a special truce was granted to the\r\nParisians, whilst Henry V., in concert with Duke Philip of Burgundy, was\r\nprosecuting the war against the _dauphin_.  On the 2d of December the\r\nbases were laid of an agreement between the English and the Burgundians.\r\nThe preliminaries of the treaty, which was drawn up in accordance with\r\nthese bases, were signed on the 9th of April, 1420, by King Charles VI.,\r\nand on the 20th communicated at Paris by the chancellor of France to the\r\nparliament and to all the religious and civil, royal and municipal\r\nauthorities of the capital.  After this communication, the chancellor and\r\nthe premier president of parliament went with these preliminaries to\r\nHenry V. at Pontoise, where he set out with a division of his army for\r\nTroyes, where the treaty, definitive and complete, was at last signed and\r\npromulgated in the cathedral of Troyes, on the 21st of May, 1420.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-eight articles in this treaty, five contained its essential\r\npoints and fixed its character: 1st. The King of France, Charles VI.,\r\ngave his daughter Catherine in marriage to Henry V., King of England.\r\n2d. “Our son, King Henry, shall place no hinderance or trouble in the way\r\nof our holding and possessing as long as we live, and as at the present\r\ntime, the crown, the kingly dignity of France, and all the revenues,\r\nproceeds, and profits which are attached thereto for the maintenance of\r\nour state and the charges of the kingdom.  3d. It is agreed that\r\nimmediately after our death, and from that time forward, the crown and\r\nkingdom of France, with all their rights and appurtenances, shall belong\r\nperpetually and shall be continued to our son King Henry and his heirs.\r\n4th. Whereas we are, at most times, prevented from advising by ourselves\r\nand from taking part in the disposal of the affairs of our kingdom, the\r\npower and the practice of governing and ordering the commonweal shall\r\nbelong and shall be continued, during our life, to our son King Henry,\r\nwith the counsel of the nobles and sages of the kingdom who shall obey us\r\nand shall desire the honor and advantage of the said kingdom.  5th. Our\r\nson King Henry shall strive with all his might, and as soon as possible,\r\nto bring back to their obedience to us, all and each of the towns,\r\ncities, castles, places, districts, and persons in our kingdom that\r\nbelong to the party commonly called of the _dauphin_ or Armagnac.”\r\n\r\nThis substitution, in the near future, of an English for the French\r\nkingship; this relinquishment, in the present, of the government of\r\nFrance to the hands of an English prince nominated to become before long\r\nher king; this authority given to the English prince to prosecute in\r\nFrance, against the _dauphin_ of France, a civil war; this complete\r\nabdication of all the rights and duties of the kingship, of paternity\r\nand of national independence; and, to sum up all in one word, this\r\nanti-French state-stroke accomplished by a king of France, with the\r\nco-operation of him who was the greatest amongst French lords, to the\r\nadvantage of a foreign sovereign--there was surely in this enough to\r\nexcite the most ardent and most legitimate national feelings.  They did\r\nnot show themselves promptly or with a blaze.  The fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, after so many military and civil troubles, had\r\ngreat weaknesses and deep-seated corruption in mind and character.\r\nNevertheless the revulsion against the treaty of Troyes was real and\r\nserious, even in the very heart of the party attached to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy.  He was obliged to lay upon several of his servants formal\r\ninjunctions to swear to this peace, which seemed to them treason.  He had\r\ngreat difficulty in winning John of Luxembourg and his brother Louis,\r\nBishop of Therouenne, over to it.  “It is your will,” said they; “we will\r\ntake this oath; but if we do, we will keep it to the hour of death.”\r\n Many less powerful lords, who had lived a long while in the household of\r\nDuke John the Fearless, quitted his son, and sorrowfully returned to\r\ntheir own homes.  They were treated as Armagnacs, but they persisted in\r\ncalling themselves good and loyal Frenchmen.  In the duchy of Burgundy\r\nthe majority of the towns refused to take the oath to the King of\r\nEngland.  The most decisive and the most helpful proof of this awakening\r\nof national feeling was the ease experienced by the _dauphin_, who was\r\none day to be Charles VII., in maintaining the war which, after the\r\ntreaty of Troyes, was, in his father’s and his mother’s name, made upon\r\nhim by the King of England and the Duke of Burgundy.  This war lasted\r\nmore than three years.  Several towns, amongst others, Melun, Crotoy,\r\nMeaux, and St. Riquier, offered an obstinate resistance to the attacks of\r\nthe English and Burgundians.  On the 23d of March, 1421, the _dauphin_’s\r\ntroops, commanded by Sire de la Fayette, gained a signal victory over\r\nthose of Henry V., whose brother, the Duke of Clarence, was killed in\r\naction.  It was in Perche, Anjou, Maine, on the banks of the Loire, and\r\nin Southern France, that the _dauphin_ found most of his enterprising and\r\ndevoted partisans.  The sojourn made by Henry V. at Paris, in December,\r\n1420, with his wife, Queen Catherine, King Charles VI., Queen Isabel, and\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, was not, in spite of galas and acclamations, a\r\nsubstantial and durable success for him.  His dignified but haughty\r\nmanners did not please the French; and he either could not or would not\r\nrender them more easy and amiable, even with men of note who were\r\nnecessary to him.  Marshal Isle-Adam one day went to see him in camp on\r\nwar-business.  The king considered that he did not present himself with\r\nsufficient ceremony.  “Isle-Adam,” said he, “is that the robe of a\r\nmarshal of France?”  “Sir, I had this whity-gray robe made to come hither\r\nby water aboard of Seine-boats.”  “Ha!” said the king, “look you a prince\r\nin the face when you speak to him?”  “Sir, it is the custom in France,\r\nthat when one man speaks to another, of whatever rank and puissance that\r\nother may be, he passes for a sorry fellow, and but little honorable, if\r\nhe dares not look him in the face.”  “It is not our fashion,” said the\r\nking; and the subject dropped there.  A popular poet of the time, Alan\r\nChattier, constituted himself censor of the moral corruption and\r\ninterpreter of the patriotic paroxysms caused by the cold and harsh\r\nsupremacy of this unbending foreigner, who set himself up for king of\r\nFrance, and had not one feeling in sympathy with the French.  Alan\r\nChartier’s _Quadriloge invectif_ is a lively and sometimes eloquent\r\nallegory, in which France personified implores her three children, the\r\nclergy, the chivalry, and the people, to forget their own quarrels and\r\nunite to save their mother whilst saving themselves; and this political\r\npamphlet getting spread about amongst the provinces did good service to\r\nthe national cause against the foreign conqueror.  An event more powerful\r\nthan any human eloquence occurred to give the _dauphin_ and his partisans\r\nearlier hopes.  Towards the end of August, 1422, Henry V.  fell ill; and,\r\ntoo stout-hearted to delude himself as to his condition, he thought no\r\nlonger of anything but preparing himself for death.  He had himself\r\nremoved to Vincennes, called his councillors about him, and gave them his\r\nlast royal instructions.  “I leave you the government of France,” said he\r\nto his brother, the Duke of Bedford, “unless our brother of Burgundy have\r\na mind to undertake it; for, above all things, I conjure you not to have\r\nany dissension with him.  If that should happen God preserve you from it!\r\n--the affairs of this kingdom, which seem well advanced for us, would\r\nbecome bad.”  As soon as he had done with politics he bade his doctors\r\ntell him how long he had still to live.  One of them knelt down before\r\nhis bed and said, “Sir, be thinking of your soul; it seemeth to us that,\r\nsaving the divine mercy, you have not more than two hours.”  The king\r\nsummoned his confessor with the priests, and asked to have recited to him\r\nthe penitential psalms.  When they came to the twentieth versicle of the\r\n_Miserere,--Ut oedificentur muri Hierusalem_ (that the walls of Jerusalem\r\nmay be built up),--He made them stop.  “Ah!” said he, “if God had been\r\npleased to let me live out my time, I would, after putting an end to the\r\nwar in France, reducing the _dauphin_ to submission or driving him out of\r\nthe kingdom in which I would have established a sound peace, have gone to\r\nconquer Jerusalem.  The wars I have undertaken have had the approval of\r\nall the proper men and of the most holy personages; I commenced them and\r\nhave prosecuted them without offence to God or peril to my soul.”  These\r\nwere his last words.  The chanting of the psalms was resumed around him,\r\nand he expired on the 31st of August, 1422, at the age of thirty-four.  A\r\ngreat soul and a great king; but a great example also of the boundless\r\nerrors which may be fallen into by the greatest men when they pursue with\r\narrogant confidence their own views, forgetting the laws of justice and\r\nthe rights of other men.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of October, 1422, less than two months after the death of\r\nHenry V., Charles VI., King of France, died at Paris in the forty-third\r\nyear of his reign.  As soon as he had been buried at St. Denis, the Duke\r\nof Bedford, regent of France according to the will of Henry V., caused a\r\nherald to proclaim, “Long live Henry of Lancaster, King of England and of\r\nFrance!”  The people’s voice made very different proclamation.  It had\r\nalways been said that the public evils proceeded from the state of\r\nillness into which the unhappy King Charles had fallen.  The goodness he\r\nhad given glimpses of in his lucid intervals had made him an object of\r\ntender pity.  Some weeks yet before his death, when he had entered Paris\r\nagain, the inhabitants, in the midst of their sufferings and under the\r\nharsh government of the English, had seen with joy their poor mad king\r\ncoming back amongst them, and had greeted him with thousand-fold shouts\r\nof “Noel!”  His body lay in state for three days, with the face\r\nuncovered, in a hall of the hostel of St. Paul, and the multitude went\r\nthither to pray for him, saying, “Ah! dear prince, never shall we have\r\nany so good as thou Wert; never shall we see thee more.  Accursed be thy\r\ndeath!  Since thou dost leave us, we shall never have aught but wars and\r\ntroubles.  As for thee, thou goest to thy rest; as for us, we remain in\r\ntribulation and sorrow.  We seem made to fall into the same distress as\r\nthe children of Israel during the captivity in Babylon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Body of Charles VI. lying in State----84]\r\n\r\nThe people’s instinct was at the same time right and wrong.  France had\r\nyet many evil days to go through and cruel trials to endure; she was,\r\nhowever, to be saved at last; Charles VI. was to be followed by Charles\r\nVII. and Joan of Arc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.----THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR.--CHARLES VII. AND JOAN\r\nOF ARC.  1422-1461.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JOAN OF ARC----85]\r\n\r\nWhilst Charles VI. was dying at Paris, his son Charles, the _dauphin_,\r\nwas on his way back from Saintonge to Berry, where he usually resided.\r\nOn the 24th of October, 1422, at Mehun-sur-Yevre, he heard of his\r\nfather’s death.  For six days longer, from the 24th to the 29th of\r\nOctober, he took no style but that of regent, as if he were waiting to\r\nsee what was going to happen elsewhere in respect of the succession to\r\nthe throne.  It was only when he knew that, on the 27th of October, the\r\nparliament of Paris had, not without some little hesitation and\r\nambiguity, recognized “as King of England and of France, Henry VI., son\r\nof Henry V. lately deceased,” that the _dauphin_ Charles assumed on the\r\n30th of October, in his castle of Mehun-sur-Yevre, the title of king, and\r\nrepaired to Bourges to inaugurate in the cathedral of that city his reign\r\nas Charles VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Shepherdess of Domremy----90]\r\n\r\nHe was twenty years old, and had as yet done nothing to gain for himself,\r\nnot to say anything of glory, the confidence and hopes of the people.  He\r\npassed for an indolent and frivolous prince, abandoned to his pleasures\r\nonly; one whose capacity there was nothing to foreshadow, and of whom\r\nFrance, outside of his own court, scarcely ever thought at all.  Some\r\ndays before his accession he had all but lost his life at Rochelle by the\r\nsudden breaking down of the room in the episcopal palace where he was\r\nstaying; and so little did the country know of what happened to him that,\r\na short time after the accident, messengers sent by some of his partisans\r\nhad arrived at Bourges to inquire if the prince were still living.  At a\r\ntime when not only the crown of the kingdom, but the existence and\r\nindependence of the nation, were at stake, Charles had not given any\r\nsigns of being strongly moved by patriotic feelings.  “He was, in person,\r\na handsome prince, and handsome in speech with all persons, and\r\ncompassionate towards poor folks,” says his contemporary Monstrelet; “but\r\nhe did not readily put on his harness, and he had no heart for war if he\r\ncould do without it.”  On ascending the throne, this young prince, so\r\nlittle of the politician and so little of the knight, encountered at the\r\nhead of his enemies the most able amongst the politicians and warriors of\r\nthe day in the Duke of Bedford, whom his brother Henry V. had appointed\r\nregent of France, and had charged to defend on behalf of his nephew,\r\nHenry VI., a child in the cradle, the crown of France, already more than\r\nhalf won.  Never did struggle appear more unequal or native king more\r\ninferior to foreign pretender.\r\n\r\nSagacious observers, however, would have easily discerned in the cause\r\nwhich appeared the stronger and the better supported many seeds of\r\nweakness and danger.  When Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, heard at\r\nArras, that Charles VI. was dead, it occurred to him immediately that if\r\nhe attended the obsequies of the English King of France he would be\r\nobliged, French prince as he was, and cousin-german of Charles VI., to\r\nyield precedence to John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France, and uncle of\r\nthe new king, Henry VI.  He resolved to hold aloof, and contented himself\r\nwith sending to Paris chamberlains to make his excuses and supply his\r\nplace with the regent.  On the 11th of November, 1422, the Duke of\r\nBedford followed alone at the funeral of the late king of France, and\r\nalone made offering at the mass.  Alone he went, but with the sword of\r\nstate borne before him as regent.  The people of Paris cast down their\r\neyes with restrained wrath.  “They wept,” says a contemporary, “and not\r\nwithout cause, for they knew not whether for a long, long while they\r\nwould have any king in France.”  But they did not for long confine\r\nthemselves to tears.  Two poets, partly in Latin and partly in French,\r\nRobert Blondel, and Alan Chartier, whilst deploring the public woes,\r\nexcited the popular feeling.  Conspiracies soon followed the songs.  One\r\nwas set on foot at Paris to deliver the city to king Charles VII., but it\r\nwas stifled ruthlessly; several burgesses were beheaded, and one woman\r\nwas burned.  In several great provincial cities, at Troyes and at Rheims,\r\nthe same ferment showed itself, and drew down the same severity.  William\r\nPrieuse, superior of the Carmelites, was accused of propagating\r\nsentiments favorable to the _dauphin_, as the English called Charles VII.\r\nBeing brought, in spite of the privileges of his gown, before John\r\nCauchon, lieutenant of the captain of Rheims [related probably to Peter\r\nCauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who nine years afterwards was to sentence\r\nJoan of Arc to be burned], he stoutly replied, “Never was English king of\r\nFrance, and never shall be.”  The country had no mind to believe in the\r\nconquest it was undergoing; and the Duke of Burgundy, the most puissant\r\nally of the English, sulkily went on eluding the consequences of the\r\nanti-national alliance he had accepted.\r\n\r\nSuch being the disposition of conquerors and conquered, the war, though\r\nstill carried on with great spirit, could not, and in fact did not, bring\r\nabout any decisive result from 1422 to 1429.  Towns were alternately\r\ntaken, lost, and retaken, at one time by the French, at another by the\r\nEnglish or Burgundians; petty encounters and even important engagements\r\ntook place with vicissitudes of success and reverses on both sides.  At\r\nCrevant-sur-Yonne, on the 31st of July, 1423, and at Verneuil, in\r\nNormandy, on the 17th of August, 1424, the French were beaten, and their\r\nfaithful allies, the Scots, suffered considerable loss.  In the latter\r\naffair, however, several Norman lords deserted the English flag, refusing\r\nto fight against the King of France.  On the 26th of September, 1423, at\r\nLa Gravelle, in Maine, the French were victorious, and Du Guesclin was\r\ncommemorated in their victory.  Anne de Laval, granddaughter of the great\r\nBreton warrior, and mistress of a castle hard by the scene of action,\r\nsent thither her son, Andrew de Laval, a child twelve years of age, and,\r\nas she buckled with her own hands the sword which his ancestor had worn,\r\nshe said to him, “God make thee as valiant as he whose sword this was!”\r\n The boy received the order of knighthood on the field of battle, and\r\nbecame afterwards a marshal of France.  Little bands, made up of\r\nvolunteers, attempted enterprises which the chiefs of the regular armies\r\nconsidered impossible.  Stephen de Vignolles, celebrated under the name\r\nof La Hire, resolved to succor the town of Montargis, besieged by the\r\nEnglish; and young Dunois, the bastard of Orleans, joined him.  On\r\narriving, September 5, 1427, beneath the walls of the place, a priest was\r\nencountered in their road.  La Hire asked him for absolution.  The priest\r\ntold him to confess.  “I have no time for that,” said La Hire; “I am in a\r\nhurry; I have done in the way of sins all that men of war are in the\r\nhabit of doing.”  Whereupon, says the chronicler, the chaplain gave him\r\nabsolution for what it was worth; and La Hire, putting his hands\r\ntogether, said, “God, I pray Thee to do for La Hire this day as much as\r\nThou wouldst have La Hire do for Thee if he were God and Thou wert La\r\nHire.”  And Montargis was rid of its besiegers.  The English determined\r\nto become masters of Mont St. Michel au peril de la mer, that abbey built\r\non a rock facing the western coast of Normandy and surrounded every day\r\nby the waves of ocean.  The thirty-second abbot, Robert Jolivet, promised\r\nto give the place up to them, and went to Rouen with that design; but one\r\nof his monks, John Enault, being elected vicar-general by the chapter,\r\nand supported by some valiant Norman warriors, offered an obstinate\r\nresistance for eight years, baffled all the attacks of the English, and\r\nretained the abbey in the possession of the King of France.  The\r\ninhabitants of La Rochelle rendered the same service to the king and to\r\nFrance in a more important case.  On the 15th of August, 1427, an English\r\nfleet of a hundred and twenty sail, it is said, appeared off their city\r\nwith invading troops aboard.  The Rochellese immediately levied upon\r\nthemselves an extraordinary tax, and put themselves in a state of\r\ndefence; troops raised in the neighborhood went and occupied the heights\r\nbordering on the coast; and a bold Breton sailor, Bernard de Kercabin,\r\nput to sea to meet the enemy, with ships armed as privateers.  The\r\nattempt of the English seemed to them to offer more danger than chance of\r\nsuccess; and they withdrew.  Thus Charles VII. kept possession of the\r\nonly seaport remaining to the crown.  Almost everywhere in the midst of a\r\nwar as indecisive as it was obstinate local patriotism and the spirit of\r\nchivalry successfully disputed against foreign supremacy the scattered\r\nfragments of the fatherland and the throne.\r\n\r\nIn order to put an end to this doubtful condition of events and of minds,\r\nthe Duke of Bedford determined to aim a grand blow at the national party\r\nin France and at her king.  After Paris and Rouen, Orleans was the most\r\nimportant city in the kingdom; it was as supreme on the banks of the\r\nLoire as Paris and Rouen were on those of the Seine.  After having\r\nobtained from England considerable re-enforcements commanded by leaders\r\nof experience, the English commenced, in October, 1428, the siege of\r\nOrleans.  The approaches to the place were occupied in force, and\r\nbastilles closely connected one with another were constructed around the\r\nwalls.  As a set-off, the most valiant warriors of France, La Hire,\r\nDunois, Xaintrailles, and the Marshal La Fayette threw themselves into\r\nOrleans, the garrison of which amounted to scarcely twelve hundred men.\r\nSeveral towns, Bourges, Poitiers, and La Rochelle, sent thither money,\r\nmunitions, and militia; the states-general, assembled at Chinon, voted an\r\nextraordinary aid; and Charles VII. called out the regulars and the\r\nreserves.  Assaults on the one side and sorties on the other were begun\r\nwith ardor.  Besiegers and besieged quite felt that they were engaged in\r\na decisive struggle.  The first encounter was unfortunate for the\r\nOrleannese.  In a fight called the Herring affair, they were unsuccessful\r\nin an attempt to carry off a supply of victuals and salt fish which Sir\r\nJohn Falstolf was bringing to the besiegers.  Being a little discouraged,\r\nthey offered the Duke of Burgundy to place their city in his hands, that\r\nit might not fall into those of the English; and Philip the Good accepted\r\nthe offer, but the Duke of Bedford made a formal objection: “He didn’t\r\ncare,” he said, “to beat the bushes for another to get the birds.”\r\n Philip in displeasure withdrew from the siege the small force of\r\nBurgundians he had sent.  The English remained alone before the place,\r\nwhich was every day harder pressed and more strictly blockaded.  The\r\nbesieged were far from foreseeing what succor was preparing for them.\r\n\r\nThis very year, on the 6th of January, 1428, at Domremy, a little village\r\nin the valley of the Meuse, between Neufchateau and Vaucouleurs, on the\r\nedge of the frontier from Champagne to Lorraine, the young daughter of\r\nsimple tillers of the soil, “of good life and repute, herself a good,\r\nsimple, gentle girl, no idler, occupied hitherto in sewing or spinning\r\nwith her mother, or driving afield her parent’s sheep, and sometimes,\r\neven, when her father’s turn came round, keeping for him the whole flock\r\nof the commune,” was fulfilling her sixteenth year.  It was Joan of Arc,\r\nwhom all her neighbors called Joannette.  She was no recluse; she often\r\nwent with her companions to sing and eat cakes beside the fountain by the\r\ngooseberry-bush, under an old beech, which was called the fairy-tree: but\r\ndancing she did not like.  She was constant at church, she delighted in\r\nthe sound of the bells, she went often to confession and communion, and\r\nshe blushed when her fair friends taxed her with being too religious.  In\r\n1421, when Joan was hardly nine, a band of Anglo-Burgundians penetrated\r\ninto her country, and transferred thither the ravages of war.  The\r\nvillage of Domremy and the little town of Vaucouleurs were French, and\r\nfaithful to the French king-ship; and Joan wept to see the lads of her\r\nparish returning bruised and bleeding from encounters with the enemy.\r\nHer relations and neighbors were one day obliged to take to flight, and\r\nat their return they found their houses burned or devastated.  Joan\r\nwondered whether it could possibly be that God permitted such excesses\r\nand disasters.  In 1425, on a summer’s day, at noon, she was in her\r\nfather’s little garden.  She heard a voice calling her, at her right\r\nside, in the direction of the church, and a great brightness shone upon\r\nher at the same time in the same spot.  At first she was frightened, but\r\nshe recovered herself on finding that “it was a worthy voice;” and, at\r\nthe second call, she perceived that it was the voice of angels.  “I saw\r\nthem with my bodily eyes,” she said, six years later, to her judges at\r\nRouen, “as plainly as I see you; when they departed from me I wept, and\r\nwould fain have had them take me with them.”  The apparitions came again\r\nand again, and exhorted her “to go to France for to deliver the kingdom.”\r\n She became dreamy, rapt in constant meditation.  “I could endure no\r\nlonger,” said she, at a later period, “and the time went heavily with me\r\nas with a woman in travail.”  She ended by telling everything to her\r\nfather, who listened to her words anxiously at first, and afterwards\r\nwrathfully.  He himself one night dreamed that his daughter had followed\r\nthe king’s men-at-arms to France, and from that moment he kept her under\r\nstrict superintendence.  “If I knew of your sister’s going,” he said to\r\nhis sons, “I would bid you drown her; and, if you did not do it, I would\r\ndrown her myself.”  Joan submitted: there was no leaven of pride in her\r\nsublimation, and she did not suppose that her intercourse with celestial\r\nvoices relieved her from the duty of obeying her parents.  Attempts were\r\nmade to distract her mind.  A young man who had courted her was induced\r\nto say that he had a promise of marriage from her, and to claim the\r\nfulfilment of it.  Joan went before the ecclesiastical judge, made\r\naffirmation that she had given no promise, and without difficulty gained\r\nher cause.  Everybody believed and respected her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joan of Arc in her Father’s Garden----91]\r\n\r\nIn a village hard by Domremy she had an uncle whose wife was near her\r\nconfinement; she got herself invited to go and nurse her aunt, and\r\nthereupon she opened her heart to her uncle, repeating to him a popular\r\nsaying, which had spread indeed throughout the country: “Is it not said\r\nthat a woman shall ruin France, and a young maid restore it?”  She\r\npressed him to take her to Vaucouleurs to Sire Robert de Baudricourt,\r\ncaptain of the bailiwick, for she wished to go to the _dauphin_ and carry\r\nassistance to him.  Her uncle gave way, and on the 13th of May, 1428, he\r\ndid take her to Vaucouleurs.  “I come on behalf of my Lord,” said she to\r\nSire de Baudricourt, “to bid you send word to the _dauphin_ to keep\r\nhimself well in hand, and not give battle to his foes, for my Lord will\r\npresently give him succor.”  “Who is thy lord?”  asked Baudricourt.  “The\r\nKing of Heaven,” answered Joan.  Baudricourt set her down for mad, and\r\nurged her uncle to take her back to her parents “with a good slap o’ the\r\nface.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1428, a fresh invasion of Burgundians occurred at Domremy, and\r\nredoubled the popular excitement there.  Shortly afterwards, the report\r\ntouching the siege of Orleans arrived there.  Joan, more and more\r\npassionately possessed with her idea, returned to Vaucouleurs.  “I must\r\ngo,” said she to Sire de Baudricourt, “for to raise the siege of Orleans.\r\nI will go, should I have to wear off my legs to the knee.”  She had\r\nreturned to Vaucouleurs without taking leave of her parents.  “Had I\r\npossessed,” said she, in 1431, to her judges at Rouen, “a hundred fathers\r\nand a hundred mothers, and had I been a king’s daughter, I should have\r\ngone.”  Baudricourt, impressed without being convinced, did not oppose\r\nher remaining at Vaucouleurs, and sent an account of this singular young\r\ngirl to Duke Charles of Lorraine, at Nancy, and perhaps even, according\r\nto some chronicles, to the king’s court.  Joan lodged at Vaucouleurs in a\r\nwheelwright’s house, and passed three weeks there, spinning with her\r\nhostess, and dividing her time between work and church.  There was much\r\ntalk in Vaucouleurs of her, and her visions, and her purpose.  John of\r\nMetz [also called John of Novelompont], a knight serving with Sire de\r\nBaudricourt, desired to see her, and went to the wheelwright’s.  “What do\r\nyou here, my dear?”  said he; “must the king be driven from his kingdom,\r\nand we become English?”  “I am come hither,” answered Joan, “to speak to\r\nRobert de Baudricourt, that he may be pleased to take me or have me taken\r\nto the king; but he pays no heed to me or my words.  However, I must be\r\nwith the king before the middle of Lent, for none in the world, nor\r\nkings, nor dukes, nor daughter of the Scottish king can recover the\r\nkingdom of France; there is no help but in me.  Assuredly I would far\r\nrather be spinning beside my poor mother, for this other is not my\r\ncondition; but I must go and do the work because my Lord wills that I\r\nshould do it.”  “Who is your lord?”  “The Lord God.”  “By my faith,”\r\n said the knight, seizing Joan’s hands, “I will take you to the king, God\r\nhelping.  When will you set out?”  “Rather now than to-morrow; rather\r\nto-morrow than later.”  Vaucouleurs was full of the fame and the sayings\r\nof Joan.  Another knight, Bertrand de Poulengy, offered, as John of Metz\r\nhad, to be her escort, Duke Charles of Lorraine wished to see her, and\r\nsent for her to Nancy.  Old and ill as he was, he had deserted the\r\nduchess his wife, a virtuous lady, and was leading anything but a regular\r\nlife.  He asked Joan’s advice about his health.  “I have no power to cure\r\nyou,” said Joan, “but go back to your wife and help me in that for which\r\nGod ordains me.”  The duke ordered her four golden crowns, and she\r\nreturned to Vaucouleurs, thinking of nothing but her departure.  There\r\nwas no want of confidence and good will on the part of the inhabitants of\r\nVaucouleurs in forwarding her preparations.  John of Metz, the knight\r\ncharged to accompany her, asked her if she intended to make the journey\r\nin her poor red rustic petticoats.  “I would like to don man’s clothes,”\r\n answered Joan.  Subscriptions were made to give her a suitable costume.\r\nShe was supplied with a horse, a coat of mail, a lance, a sword, the\r\ncomplete equipment, indeed, of a man-at-arms; and a king’s messenger and\r\nan archer formed her train.  Baudricourt made them swear to escort her\r\nsafely, and on the 25th of February, 1429, he bade her farewell, and all\r\nhe said was, “Away then, Joan, and come what may.”\r\n\r\nCharles VII. was at that time residing at Chinon, in Touraine.  In order\r\nto get there Joan had nearly a hundred and fifty leagues to go, in a\r\ncountry occupied here and there by English and Burgundians, and\r\neverywhere a theatre of war.  She took eleven days to do this journey,\r\noften marching by night, never giving up man’s dress, disquieted by no\r\ndifficulty and no danger, and testifying no desire for a halt save to\r\nworship God.  “Could we hear mass daily,” said she to her comrades, “we\r\nshould do well.”  They only consented twice, first in the abbey of St.\r\nUrban, and again in the principal church of Auxerre.  As they were full\r\nof respect, though at the same time also of doubt, towards Joan, she\r\nnever had to defend herself against their familiarities, but she had\r\nconstantly to dissipate their disquietude touching the reality or the\r\ncharacter of her mission.  “Fear nothing,” she said to them; “God shows\r\nme the way I should go; for thereto was I born.”  On arriving at the\r\nvillage of St. Catherine-de-Fierbois, near Chinon, she heard three masses\r\non the same day, and had a letter written thence to the king, to announce\r\nher coming and to ask to see him; she had gone, she said, a hundred and\r\nfifty leagues to come and tell him things which would be most useful to\r\nhim.  Charles VII. and his councillors hesitated.  The men of war did not\r\nlike to believe that a little peasant-girl of Lorraine was coming to\r\nbring the king a more effectual support than their own.  Nevertheless\r\nsome, and the most heroic amongst them,--Dunois, La Hire, and\r\nXaintrailles,--were moved by what was told of this young girl.  The\r\nletters of Sire de Baudricourt, though full of doubt, suffered a gleam of\r\nsomething like a serious impression to peep out; and why should not the\r\nking receive this young girl whom the captain of Vaucouleurs had thought\r\nit a duty to send?  It would soon be seen what she was and what she would\r\ndo.  The politicians and courtiers, especially the most trusted of them,\r\nGeorge de la Tremoille, the king’s favorite, shrugged their shoulders.\r\nWhat could be expected from the dreams of a young peasant-girl of\r\nnineteen?  Influences of a more private character and more disposed\r\ntowards sympathy--Yolande of Arragon, for instance, Queen of Sicily and\r\nmother-in-law of Charles VII., and perhaps, also, her daughter, the young\r\nqueen, Mary of Anjou, were urgent for the king to reply to Joan that she\r\nmight go to Chinon.  She was authorized to do so, and, on the 6th of\r\nMarch, 1429, she with her comrades arrived at the royal residence.\r\n\r\nAt the very first moment two incidents occurred to still further increase\r\nthe curiosity of which she was the object.  Quite close to Chinon some\r\nvagabonds, it is said, had prepared an ambuscade for the purpose of\r\ndespoiling her, her and her train.  She passed close by them without the\r\nleast obstacle.  The rumor went that at her approach they were struck\r\nmotionless, and had been unable to attempt their wicked purpose.  Joan\r\nwas rather tall, well shaped, dark, with a look of composure, animation,\r\nand gentleness.  A man-at-arms, who met her on her way, thought her\r\npretty, and with an impious oath expressed a coarse sentiment.  “Alas!”\r\n said Joan, “thou blasphemest thy God, and yet thou art so near thy\r\ndeath!”  He drowned himself, it is said, soon after.  Already popular\r\nfeeling was surrounding her marvellous mission with a halo of\r\ninstantaneous miracles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINON CASTLE----95]\r\n\r\nOn her arrival at Chinon she at first lodged with an honest family near\r\nthe castle.  For three days longer there was a deliberation in the\r\ncouncil as to whether the king ought to receive her.  But there was bad\r\nnews from Orleans.  There were no more troops to send thither, and there\r\nwas no money forthcoming: the king’s treasurer, it was said, had but four\r\ncrowns in the chest.  If Orleans were taken, the king would perhaps be\r\nreduced to seeking a refuge in Spain or in Scotland.  Joan promised to\r\nset Orleans free.  The Orleannese themselves were clamorous for her;\r\nDunois kept up their spirits with the expectation of this marvellous\r\nassistance.  It was decided that the king should receive her.  She had\r\nassigned to her for residence an apartment in the tower of the Coudray, a\r\nblock of quarters adjoining the royal mansion, and she was committed to\r\nthe charge of William Bellier, an officer of the king’s household, whose\r\nwife was a woman of great piety and excellent fame.  On the 9th of March,\r\n1429, Joan was at last introduced into the king’s presence by the Count\r\nof Vendome, high steward, in the great hall on the first story, a portion\r\nof the wall and the fireplace being still visible in the present day.  It\r\nwas evening, candle-light; and nearly three hundred knights were present.\r\nCharles kept himself a little aloof, amidst a group of warriors and\r\ncourtiers more richly dressed than he.  According to some chroniclers,\r\nJoan had demanded that “she should not be deceived, and should have\r\npointed out to her him to whom she was to speak;” others affirm that she\r\nwent straight to the king, whom she had never seen, “accosting him humbly\r\nand simply, like a poor little shepherdess,” says an eye-witness, and,\r\naccording to another account, “making the usual bends and reverences as\r\nif she had been brought up at court.”  Whatever may have been her outward\r\nbehavior, “Gentle _dauphin_,” she said to the king (for she did not think\r\nit right to call him king so long as he was not crowned), “my name is Joan\r\nthe maid; the King of Heaven sendeth you word by me that you shall be\r\nanointed and crowned in the city of Rheims, and shall be lieutenant of\r\nthe King of Heaven, who is King of France.  It is God’s pleasure that our\r\nenemies the English should depart to their own country; if they depart no\r\nevil will come to them, and the kingdom is sure to continue yours.”\r\n Charles was impressed without being convinced, as so many others had been\r\nbefore, or were, as he was, on that very day.  He saw Joan again several\r\ntimes.  She did not delude herself as to the doubts he still entertained.\r\n“Gentle _dauphin_,” she said to him one day, “why do you not believe me?\r\nI say unto you that God hath compassion on you, your kingdom, and your\r\npeople; St. Louis and Charlemagne are kneeling before Him, making prayer\r\nfor you, and I will say unto you, so please you, a thing which will give\r\nyou to understand that you ought to believe me.”  Charles gave her\r\naudience on this occasion in the presence, according to some accounts, of\r\nfour witnesses, the most trusted of his intimates, who swore to reveal\r\nnothing, and, according to others, completely alone.  “What she said to\r\nhim there is none who knows,” wrote Alan Chartier, a short time after [in\r\nJuly, 1429], “but it is quite certain that he was all radiant with joy\r\nthereat as at a revelation from the Holy Spirit.”  M. Wallop, after a\r\nscrupulous sifting of evidence, has given the following exposition of\r\nthis mysterious interview.  “Sire de Boisy,” he says, “who was in his\r\nyouth one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber on the most familiar terms\r\nwith Charles VII., told Peter Sala, giving the king himself as his\r\nauthority for the story, that one day, at the period of his greatest\r\nadversity, the prince, vainly looking for a remedy against so many\r\ntroubles, entered in the morning, alone, into his oratory, and there,\r\nwithout uttering a word aloud, made prayer to God from the depths of his\r\nheart that if he were the true heir, issue of the house of France (and a\r\ndoubt was possible with such a queen as Isabel of Bavaria), and the\r\nkingdom ought justly to be his, God would be pleased to keep and defend\r\nit for him; if not, to give him grace to escape without death or\r\nimprisonment, and find safety in Spain or in Scotland, where he intended\r\nin the last resort to seek a refuge.  This prayer, known to God alone,\r\nthe Maid recalled to the mind of Charles VII.; and thus is explained the\r\njoy which, as the witnesses say, he testified, whilst none at that time\r\nknew the cause.  Joan by this revelation not only caused the king to\r\nbelieve in her; she caused him to believe in himself and his right and\r\ntitle: though she never spoke in that way as of her own motion to the\r\nking, it was always a superior power speaking by her voice, ‘I tell thee\r\non behalf of my Lord that thou art true heir of France, and son of the\r\nking.’” (Jeanne d’Arc, by M. Wallon, t. i. p. 32.)\r\n\r\nWhether Charles VII. were or were not convinced by this interview of\r\nJoan’s divine mission, he clearly saw that many of those about him had\r\nlittle or no faith in it, and that other proofs were required to upset\r\ntheir doubts.  He resolved to go to Poitiers, where his council, the\r\nparliament, and several learned members of the University of Paris were\r\nin session, and have Joan put to the strictest examination.  When she\r\nlearned her destination, she said, “In the name of God, I know that I\r\nshall have tough work there, but my Lord will help me.  Let us go, then,\r\nfor God’s sake.”  On her arrival at Poitiers, on the 11th of March, 1429,\r\nshe was placed in one of the most respectable families in the town, that\r\nof John Rabuteau, advocate-general in parliament.  The Archbishop of\r\nRheims, Reginald de Chartres, Chancellor of France, five bishops, the\r\nking’s councillors, several learned doctors, and amongst others Father\r\nSeguin, an austere and harsh Dominican, repaired thither to question her.\r\nWhen she saw them come in, she went and sat down at the end of the bench,\r\nand asked them what they wanted with her.  For two hours they set\r\nthemselves to the task of showing her, “by fair and gentle arguments,”\r\n that she was not entitled to belief.  “Joan,” said William Aimery,\r\nprofessor of theology, “you ask for men-at-arms, and you say that it is\r\nGod’s pleasure that the English should leave the kingdom of France, and\r\ndepart to their own land; if so, there is no need of men-at-arms, for\r\nGod’s pleasure alone can discomfit them, and force them to return to\r\ntheir homes.”  “In the name of God,” answered Joan, “the men-at-arms will\r\ndo battle, and God will give them victory.”  Master William did not urge\r\nhis point.  The Dominican, Seguin, “a very sour man,” says the chronicle,\r\nasked Joan what language the voices spoke to her.  “Better than yours,”\r\n answered Joan.  The doctor spoke the Limousine dialect.  “Do you believe\r\nin God?” he asked, ill-humoredly.  “More than you do,” retorted Joan,\r\noffended.  “Well,” rejoined the monk, “God forbids belief in you without\r\nsome sign tending thereto: I shall not give the king advice to trust\r\nmen-at-arms to you, and put them in peril on your simple word.”  “In the\r\nname of God,” said Joan, “I am not come to Poitiers to show signs; take\r\nme to Orleans, and I will give you signs of what I am sent for.  Let me\r\nhave ever so few men-at-arms given me, and I will go to Orleans;” then,\r\naddressing another of the examiners, Master Peter of Versailles, who was\r\nafterwards Bishop of Meaux, she said, “I know nor A nor B; but in our\r\nLord’s book there is more than in your books; I come on behalf of the\r\nKing of Heaven to cause the siege of Orleans to be raised, and to take\r\nthe king to Rheims, that he may be crowned and anointed there.”  The\r\nexamination was prolonged for a fortnight, not without symptoms of\r\nimpatience on the part of Joan.  At the end of it, she said to one of the\r\ndoctors, John Erault, “Have you paper and ink?  Write what I shall say to\r\nyou.”  And she dictated a form of letter which became, some weeks later,\r\nthe manifesto addressed in a more developed shape by her from Orleans to\r\nthe English, calling upon them to raise the siege and put a stop to the\r\nwar.  The chief of those piously and patriotically heroic phrases were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     “Jesu Maria,\r\n\r\n     “King of England, account to the King of Heaven for His blood royal.\r\n     Give up to the Maid the keys of all the good towns you have taken by\r\n     force.  She is come from God to avenge the blood royal, and quite\r\n     ready to make peace, if you will render proper account.  If you do\r\n     not so I am a war-chief; in whatsoever place I shall fall in with\r\n     your folks in France, if they be not willing to obey, I shall make\r\n     them get thence, whether they will or not; and if they be willing to\r\n     obey, I will receive them to mercy.  .  .  .  The Maid cometh from\r\n     the King of Heaven as His representative, to thrust you out of\r\n     France; she doth promise and certify you that she will make therein\r\n     such mighty _haha_ [great tumult], that for a thousand years\r\n     hitherto in France was never the like.  .  .  .  Duke of Bedford,\r\n     who call yourself regent of France, the Maid doth pray you and\r\n     request you not to bring destruction on yourself; if you do not\r\n     justice towards her, she will do the finest deed ever done in\r\n     Christendom.\r\n\r\n     “Writ on Tuesday in the great week.” [Easter week, March, 1429].\r\n     Subscribed: “Hearken to the news from God and the\r\n\r\n     Maid.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of their examination, the doctors decided in Joan’s favor.\r\nTwo of them, the Bishop of Castres, Gerard Machet, the king’s confessor,\r\nand Master John Erault, recognized the divine nature of her mission.  She\r\nwas, they said, the virgin foretold in the ancient prophecies, notably in\r\nthose of Merlin; and the most exacting amongst them approved of the\r\nking’s having neither accepted nor rejected, with levity, the promises\r\nmade by Joan; “after a grave inquiry there had been discovered in her,”\r\n they said, “nought but goodness, humility, devotion, honesty, simplicity.\r\nBefore Orleans she professes to be going to show her sign; so she must be\r\ntaken to Orleans, for to give her up without any appearance on her part\r\nof evil would be to fight against the Holy Spirit, and to become unworthy\r\nof aid from God.”  After the doctors’ examination came that of the women.\r\nThree of the greatest ladies in France, Yolande of Arragon, Queen of\r\nSicily; the Countess of Gaucourt, wife of the Governor of Orleans; and\r\nJoan de Mortemer, wife of Robert le Macon, Baron of Troves, were charged\r\nto examine Joan as to her life as a woman.  They found therein nothing\r\nbut truth, virtue, and modesty; “she spoke to them with such sweetness\r\nand grace,” says the chronicle, “that she drew tears from their eyes;”\r\n and she excused herself to them for the dress she wore, and for which the\r\nsternest doctors had not dreamed of reproaching her.  “It is more\r\ndecent,” said the Archbishop of Embrun, “to do such things in man’s\r\ndress, since they must be done along with men.”  The men of intelligence\r\nat court bowed down before this village-saint, who was coming to bring to\r\nthe king in his peril assistance from God; the most valiant men of war\r\nwere moved by the confident outbursts of her patriotic courage; and the\r\npeople everywhere welcomed her with faith and enthusiasm.  Joan had as\r\nyet only just appeared, and already she was the heaven-sent interpretress\r\nof the nation’s feeling, the hope of the people of France.\r\n\r\nCharles no longer hesitated.  Joan was treated, according to her own\r\nexpression in her letter to the English, “as a war-chief;” there were\r\nassigned to her a squire, a page, two heralds, a chaplain, Brother\r\nPasquerel, of the order of the hermit-brotherhood of St. Augustin,\r\nvarlets, and serving-folks.  A complete suit of armor was made to fit\r\nher.  Her two guides, John of Metz and Bertrand of Poulengy, had not\r\nquitted her; and the king continued them in her train.  Her sword he\r\nwished to be supplied by himself; she asked for one marked with five\r\ncrosses; it would be found, she said, behind the altar in the chapel of\r\nSt.  Catherine-de-Fierbois, where she had halted on her arrival at\r\nChinon; and there, indeed, it was found.  She had a white banner made,\r\nstudded with lilies, bearing the representation of God seated upon the\r\nclouds, and holding in His hand the globe of the world.  Above were the\r\nwords “Jesu Maria,” and below were two angels, on their knees in\r\nadoration.  Joan was fond of her sword, as she said two years afterwards\r\nat her trial, but she was forty times more fond of her banner, which was,\r\nin her eyes, the sign of her commission and the pledge of victory.  On\r\nthe completion of the preparations she demanded the immediate departure\r\nof the expedition.  Orleans was crying for succor; Dunois was sending\r\nmessenger after messenger; and Joan was in a greater hurry than anybody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nMore than a month elapsed before her anxieties were satisfied.  During\r\nthis interval we find Charles VII. and Joan of Arc at Chatelherault, at\r\nPoitiers, at Tours, at Florent-les-Saumur, at Chinon, and at Blois, going\r\nto and fro through all that country to push forward the expedition\r\nresolved upon, and to remove the obstacles it encountered.  Through a\r\nhaze of vague indications a glimpse is caught of the struggle which was\r\ncommencing between the partisans and the adversaries of Joan, and in\r\nfavor of or in opposition to the impulse she was communicating to the war\r\nof nationality.  Charles VII.’s mother-in-law, Yolande of Arragon, Queen\r\nof Sicily, and the young Duke of Alencon, whose father had been killed at\r\nthe battle of Agincourt, were at the head of Joan’s partisans.  Yolande\r\ngave money and took a great deal of trouble in order to promote the\r\nexpedition which was to go and succor Orleans.  The Duke of Alencon,\r\nhardly twenty years of age, was the only one amongst the princes of the\r\nhouse of Valois who had given Joan a kind reception on her arrival, and\r\nwho, together with the brave La Hire, said that he would follow her\r\nwhithersoever she pleased to lead him.  Joan, in her gratitude, called\r\nhim the handsome duke, and exhibited towards him amity and confidence.\r\n\r\nBut, side by side with these friends, she had an adversary in the king’s\r\nfavorite, George de la Tremoille, an ambitious courtier, jealous of any\r\none who seemed within the range of the king’s favor, and opposed to a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war, since it hampered him in the policy he\r\nwished to keep up towards the Duke of Burgundy.  To the ill will of La\r\nTremoille was added that of the majority of courtiers enlisted in the\r\nfollowing of the powerful favorite, and that of warriors irritated at the\r\nimportance acquired at their expense by a rustic and fantastic little\r\nadventuress.  Here was the source of the enmities and intrigues which\r\nstood in the way of all Joan’s demands, rendered her successes more\r\ntardy, difficult, and incomplete, and were one day to cost her more\r\ndearly still.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about five weeks the expedition was in readiness.  It was a\r\nheavy convoy of revictualment, protected by a body of ten or twelve\r\nthousand men, commanded by Marshal de Boussac, and numbering amongst them\r\nXaintrailles and La Hire.  The march began on the 27th of April, 1429.\r\nJoan had caused the removal of all women of bad character, and had\r\nrecommended her comrades to confess.  She took the communion in the open\r\nair, before their eyes; and a company of priests, headed by her chaplain,\r\nPasquerel, led the way whilst chanting sacred hymns.  Great was the\r\nsurprise amongst the men-at-arms, many had words of mockery on their\r\nlips.  It was the time when La Hire used to say, “If God were a soldier,\r\nHe would turn robber.”  Nevertheless, respect got the better of habit;\r\nthe most honorable were really touched; the coarsest considered\r\nthemselves bound to show restraint.  On the 29th of April they arrived\r\nbefore Orleans.  But, in consequence of the road they had followed, the\r\nLoire was between the army and the town; the expeditionary corps had to\r\nbe split in two; the troops were obliged to go and feel for the bridge of\r\nBlois in order to ‘cross the river; and Joan was vexed and surprised.\r\nDunois, arrived from Orleans in a little boat, urged her to enter the\r\ntown that same evening.  “Are you the bastard of Orleans?” asked she,\r\nwhen he accosted her.  “Yes; and I am rejoiced at your coming.”  “Was it\r\nyou who gave counsel for making me come hither by this side of the river,\r\nand not the direct way, over yonder where Talbot and the English were?”\r\n “Yes; such was the opinion of the wisest captains.”  “In the name of God,\r\nthe counsel of my Lord is wiser than yours; you thought to deceive me,\r\nand you have deceived yourselves, for I am bringing you the best succor\r\nthat ever had knight, or town, or city, and that is the good will of God,\r\nand succor from the King of Heaven; not assuredly for love of me, it is\r\nfrom God only that it proceeds.”  It was a great trial for Joan to\r\nseparate from her comrades, “so well prepared, penitent, and well\r\ndisposed; in their company,” said she, “I should not fear the whole power\r\nof the English.”  She was afraid that disorder might set in amongst the\r\ntroops, and that they might break up, instead of fulfilling her mission.\r\nDunois was urgent for her to go herself at once into Orleans, with such\r\nportion of the convoy as boats might be able to transport thither without\r\ndelay.  “Orleans,” said he, “would count it for nought, if they received\r\nthe victuals without the Maid.”  Joan decided to go: the captains of her\r\ndivision promised to rejoin her at Orleans; she left them her chaplain,\r\nPasquerel, the priests who accompanied him, and the banner around which\r\nshe was accustomed to muster them; and she herself, with Dunois, La Hire,\r\nand two hundred men-at-arms, crossed the river at the same time with a\r\npart of the supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOAN ENTERING ORLEANS----104]\r\n\r\nThe same day, at eight P. M., she entered the city, on horseback,\r\ncompletely armed, preceded by her own banner, and having beside her\r\nDunois, and behind her the captains of the garrison and several of the\r\nmost distinguished burgesses of Orleans who had gone out to meet her.\r\nThe population, one and all, rushed thronging round her, carrying\r\ntorches, and greeting her arrival “with joy as great as if they had seen\r\nGod come down amongst them.  They felt,” says the Journal of the Siege,\r\n“all of them recomforted and as it were disbesieged by the divine virtue\r\nwhich they had been told existed in this simple maid.”  In their anxiety\r\nto approach her, to touch her, one of their lighted torches set fire to\r\nher banner.  Joan disengaged herself with her horse as cleverly as it\r\ncould have been done by the most skilful horseman, and herself\r\nextinguished the flame.  The crowd attended her to the church whither she\r\ndesired to go first of all to render thanks to God, and then to the house\r\nof John Boucher, the Duke of Orleans’s treasurer, where she was received\r\ntogether with her two brothers and the two gentlemen who had been her\r\nguides from Vaucouleurs.  The treasurer’s wife was one of the most\r\nvirtuous city dames in Orleans, and from this night forth her daughter\r\nCharlotte had Joan for her bedfellow.  A splendid supper had been\r\nprepared for her; but she would merely dip some slices of bread in wine\r\nand water.  Neither her enthusiasm nor her success, the two greatest\r\ntempters to pride in mankind, made any change in her modesty and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nThe very day after her arrival she would have liked to go and attack the\r\nEnglish in their bastilles, within which they kept themselves shut up.\r\nLa Hire was pretty much of her opinion; but Dunois and the captains of\r\nthe garrison thought they ought to await the coming of the troops which\r\nhad gone to cross the Loire at Blois, and the supports which several\r\nFrench garrisons in the neighborhood had received orders to forward to\r\nOrleans.  Joan insisted. Sire de Gamaches, one of the officers present,\r\ncould not contain himself. “Since ear is given,” said he, “to the advice\r\nof a wench of low degree rather than to that of a knight like me, I will\r\nnot bandy more words; when the time comes, it shall be my sword that\r\nwill speak; I shall fall, perhaps, but the king and my own honor demand\r\nit; henceforth I give up my banner and am nothing more than a poor\r\nesquire.  I prefer to have for master a noble man rather than a girl who\r\nhas heretofore been, perhaps, I know not what.”  He furled his banner\r\nand handed it to Dunois.  Dunois, as sensible as he was brave, would not\r\ngive heed either to the choler of Gamaches or to the insistence of Joan;\r\nand, thanks to his intervention, they were reconciled on being induced\r\nto think better, respectively, of giving up the banner and ordering an\r\nimmediate attack.  Dunois went to Blois to hurry the movements of the\r\ndivision which had repaired thither; and his presence there was highly\r\nnecessary, since Joan’s enemies, especially the chancellor Regnault,\r\nwere nearly carrying a decision that no such re-enforcement should be\r\nsent to Orleans.  Dunois frustrated this purpose, and led back to\r\nOrleans, by way of Beauce, the troops concentrated at Blois.  On the 4th\r\nof May, as soon as it was known that he was coming, Joan, La Hire, and\r\nthe principal leaders of the city as well as of the garrison, went to\r\nmeet him, and re-entered Orleans with him and his troops, passing\r\nbetween the bastilles of the English, who made not even an attempt to\r\noppose them.  “That is the sorceress yonder,” said some of the\r\nbesiegers; others asked if it were quite so clear that her power, did\r\nnot come to her from on high; and their commander, the Earl of Suffolk,\r\nbeing himself, perhaps, uncertain, did not like to risk it: doubt\r\nproduced terror, and terror inactivity.  The convoy from Blois entered\r\nOrleans, preceded by Brother Pasquerel and the priests.\r\n\r\nJoan, whilst she was awaiting it, sent the English captains a fresh\r\nsummons to withdraw conformably with the letter which she had already\r\naddressed to them from Blois, and the principal clauses of which were\r\njust now quoted here.  They replied with coarse insults, calling her\r\nstrumpet and cow-girl, and threatening to burn her when they caught her.\r\nShe was very much moved by their insults, insomuch as to weep; but\r\ncalling God to witness her innocence, she found herself comforted, and\r\nexpressed it by saying, “I have had news from my Lord.”  The English had\r\ndetained the first herald she had sent them; and when she would have sent\r\nthem a second to demand his comrade back, he was afraid.  “In the name of\r\nGod,” said Joan, “they will do no harm nor to thee nor to him; thou shalt\r\ntell Talbot to arm, and I too will arm; let him show himself in front of\r\nthe city; if he can take me, let him burn me; if I discomfit him, let him\r\nraise the siege, and let the English get them gone to their own country.”\r\n The second herald appeared to be far from reassured; but Dunois charged\r\nhim to say that the English prisoners should answer for what was done to\r\nthe heralds from the Maid.  The two heralds were sent back.  Joan made up\r\nher mind to iterate in person to the English the warnings she had given\r\nthem in her letter.  She mounted upon one of the bastions of Orleans,\r\nopposite the English bastille called Tournelles, and there, at the top of\r\nher voice, she repeated her counsel to them to be gone; else, woe and\r\nshame would come upon them.  The commandant of the bastille, Sir William\r\nGladesdale [called by Joan and the French chroniclers _Glacidas_],\r\nanswered with the usual insults, telling her to go back and mind her\r\ncows, and alluding to the French as miscreants.  “You lie,” cried Joan,\r\n“and in spite of you soon shall ye depart hence; many of your people\r\nshall be slain; but as for you, you shall not see it.”\r\n\r\nDunois, the very day of his return to Orleans, after dinner, went to call\r\nupon Joan, and told her that he had heard on his way that Sir John\r\nFalstolf, the same who on the 12th of the previous February had beaten\r\nthe French in the Herring affair, was about to arrive with\r\nre-enforcements and supplies for the besiegers.  “Bastard, bastard,” said\r\nJoan, “in the name of God I command thee, as soon as thou shalt know of\r\nthis Pascot’s coming, to have me warned of it, for, should he pass\r\nwithout my knowing of it, I promise thee that I will have thy head cut\r\noff.”  Dunois assured her that she should be warned.  Joan was tired with\r\nthe day’s excitement; she threw herself upon her bed to sleep, but\r\nunsuccessfully; all at once she said to Sire Daulon, her esquire, “My\r\ncounsel doth tell me to go against the English; but I know not whether\r\nagainst their bastilles or against this Fascot.  I must arm.”  Her\r\nesquire was beginning to arm her when she heard it shouted in the street\r\nthat the enemy were at that moment doing great damage to the French.  “My\r\nGod,” said she, “the blood of our people is running on the ground; why\r\nwas I not awakened sooner?  Ah! it was ill done!  .  .  .  My arms!  My\r\narms! my horse!” Leaving behind her esquire, who was not yet armed, she\r\nwent down.  Her page was playing at the door: “Ah! naughty boy,” said\r\nshe, “not to come and tell me that the blood of France was being shed!\r\nCome! quick! my horse!” It was brought to her; she bade them hand down to\r\nher by the window her banner, which she had left behind, and, without any\r\nfurther waiting, she departed and went to the Burgundy gate, whence the\r\nnoise seemed to come.  Seeing on her way one of the townsmen passing who\r\nwas being carried off wounded, she said, “Alas! I never see a Frenchman’s\r\nblood but my hair stands up on my head!”  It was some of the Orleannese\r\nthemselves who, without consulting their chiefs, had made a sortie and\r\nattacked the Bastille St. Loup, the strongest held by the English on this\r\nside.  The French had been repulsed, and were falling back in flight when\r\nJoan came up, and soon after her Dunois and a throng of men-at-arms who\r\nhad been warned of the danger.  The fugitives returned to the assault;\r\nthe battle was renewed with ardor; the bastille of St. Loup,\r\nnotwithstanding energetic resistance on the part of the English who\r\nmanned it, was taken; and all its defenders were put to the sword before\r\nTalbot and the main body of the besiegers could come up to their\r\nassistance.  Joan showed sorrow that so many people should have died\r\nunconfessed; and she herself was the means of saving some who had\r\ndisguised themselves as priests in gowns which they had taken from the\r\nchurch of St. Loup.  Great was the joy in Orleans, and the enthusiasm for\r\nJoan was more lively than ever.  “Her voices had warned her,” they said,\r\n“and apprised her that there was a battle; and then she had found by\r\nherself alone and without any guide the way to the Burgundy gate.”\r\n Men-at-arms and burgesses all demanded that the attack upon the English\r\nhastilles should be resumed; but the next day, the 5th of May, was\r\nAscension-day.  Joan advocated lions repose on this holy festival, and\r\nthe general feeling was in accord with her own.  She recommended her\r\ncomrades to fulfil their religious duties, and she herself received the\r\ncommunion.  The chiefs of the besieged resolved to begin on the morrow a\r\ncombined attack upon the English bastilles which surrounded the palace;\r\nbut Joan was not in their counsels.  “Tell me what you have resolved,”\r\n she said to them; “I can keep this and greater secrets.”  Dunois made her\r\nacquainted with the plan adopted, of which she fully approved; and on the\r\nmorrow, the 6th of May, a fierce struggle began again all round Orleans.\r\nFor two days the bastilles erected by the besiegers against the place\r\nwere repeatedly attacked by the besieged.  On the first day Joan was\r\nslightly wounded in the foot.  Some disagreement arose between her and\r\nSire de Gaucourt, governor of Orleans, as to continuing the struggle; and\r\nJohn Boucher, her host, tried to keep her back the second day.  “Stay and\r\ndine with us,” said he, “to eat that shad which has just been brought.”\r\n “Keep it for supper,” said Joan; “I will come back this evening and bring\r\nyou some goddamns (Englishman) or other to eat his share;” and she\r\nsallied forth, eager to return to the assault.  On arriving at the\r\nBurgundy gate she found it closed; the governor would not allow any\r\nsortie thereby to attack on that side.  “Ah! naughty man,” said Joan,\r\n“you are wrong; whether you will or no, our men-at-arms shall go and win\r\non this day as they have already won.”  The gate was forced; and\r\nmen-at-arms and burgesses rushed out from all quarters to attack the\r\nbastille of Tournelles, the strongest of the English works.  It was ten\r\no’clock in the morning; the passive and active powers of both parties\r\nwere concentrated on this point; and for a moment the French appeared\r\nweary and downcast.  Joan took a scaling-ladder, set it against the\r\nrampart, and was the first to mount.  There came an arrow and struck her\r\nbetween neck and shoulder, and she fell.  Sire de Gamaches, who had but\r\nlately displayed so much temper towards her, found her where she lay.\r\n“Take my horse,” said he, “and bear no malice: I was wrong; I had formed\r\na false idea of you.”  “Yes,” said Joan, “and bear no malice: I never saw\r\na more accomplished knight.”  She was taken away and had her armor\r\nremoved.  The arrow, it is said, stood out almost half-a-foot behind.\r\nThere was an instant of faintness and tears; but she prayed and felt her\r\nstrength renewed, and pulled out the arrow with her own hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Herself drew out the Arrow----109]\r\n\r\nSome one proposed to her to charm the wound by means of cabalistic words;\r\nbut “I would rather die,” she said, “than so sin against the will of God.\r\nI know full well that I must die some day; but I know nor where nor when\r\nnor how.  If, without sin, my wound may be healed, I am right willing.”\r\n A dressing of oil and lard was applied to the wound; and she retired\r\napart into a vineyard, and was continually in prayer.  Fatigue and\r\ndiscouragement were overcoming the French; and the captains ordered the\r\nretreat to be sounded.  Joan begged Dunois to wait a while.  “My God,”\r\n said she, “we shall soon be inside.  Give your people a little rest; eat\r\nand drink.”  She resumed her arms and remounted her horse; her banner\r\nfloated in the air; the French took fresh courage; the English, who\r\nthought Joan half dead, were seized with surprise and fear; and one of\r\ntheir principal leaders, Sir William Gladesdale, made up his mind to\r\nabandon the outwork which he had hitherto so well kept, and retire within\r\nthe bastille itself.  Joan perceived his movement.  “Yield thee,” she\r\nshouted to him from afar; “yield thee to the King of Heaven!  Ah!\r\nGlacidas, thou hast basely insulted me; but I have great pity on the\r\nsouls of thee and thine.”  The Englishman continued his retreat.  Whilst\r\nhe was passing over the drawbridge which reached from the out-work to the\r\nbastille, a shot from the side of Orleans broke down the bridge;\r\nGladesdale fell into the water and was drowned, together with many of his\r\ncomrades; the French got into the bastille without any fresh fighting;\r\nand Joan re-entered Orleans amidst the joy and acclamations of the\r\npeople.  The bells rang all through the night, and the Te Deum was\r\nchanted.  The day of combat was about to be succeeded by the day of\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the 8th of May, 1429, at daybreak, the English leaders\r\ndrew up their troops close to the very moats of the city, and seemed to\r\noffer battle to the French.  Many of the Orleannese leaders would have\r\nliked to accept this challenge; but Joan got up from her bed, where she\r\nwas resting because of her wound, put on a light suit of armor, and ran\r\nto the city gates.  “For the love and honor of holy Sunday,” said she to\r\nthe assembled warriors, “do not be the first to attack, and make to them\r\nno demand; it is God’s good will and pleasure that they be allowed to get\r\nthem gone if they be minded to go away; if they attack you, defend\r\nyourselves boldly; you will be the masters.”  She caused an altar to be\r\nraised; thanksgivings were sung, and mass was celebrated.  “See!” said\r\nJoan; “are the English turning to you their faces, or verily their\r\nbacks?”  They had commenced their retreat in good order, with standards\r\nflying.  “Let them go: my Lord willeth not that there be any fighting\r\nto-day; you shall have them another time.”  The good words spoken by Joan\r\nwere not so preventive but that many men set off to pursue the English,\r\nand cut off stragglers and baggage.  Their bastilles were found to be\r\nfull of victual and munitions; and they had abandoned their sick and many\r\nof their prisoners.  The siege of Orleans was raised.\r\n\r\nThe day but one after this deliverance, Joan set out to go and rejoin the\r\nking, and prosecute her work at his side.  She fell in with him on the\r\n13th of May, at Tours, moved forward to meet him, with her banner in her\r\nhand and her head uncovered, and bending down over her charger’s neck,\r\nmade him a deep obeisance.  Charles took off his cap, held out his hand\r\nto her, and, “as it seemed to many,” says a contemporary chronicler, “he\r\nwould fain have kissed her, for the joy that he felt.”  But the king’s\r\njoy was not enough for Joan.  She urged him to march with her against\r\nenemies who were flying, so to speak, from themselves, and to start\r\nwithout delay for Rheims, where he would be crowned.  “I shall hardly\r\nlast more than a year,” said she; “we must think about working right well\r\nthis year, for there is much to do.”  Hesitation was natural to Charles,\r\neven in the hour of victory.  His favorite, La Tremoille, and his\r\nchancellor, the Archbishop of Rheims, opposed Joan’s entreaties with all\r\nthe objections that could be devised under the inspiration of their ill\r\nwill: there were neither troops nor money in hand for so great a journey;\r\nand council after council was held for the purpose of doing nothing.\r\nJoan, in her impatience, went one day to Loches, without previous notice,\r\nand tapped softly at the door of the king’s privy chamber (chambre de re-\r\ntrait).  He bade her enter.  She fell upon her knees, saying, “Gentle\r\n_dauphin_, hold not so many and such long councils, but rather come to\r\nRheims, and there assume your crown; I am much pricked to take you\r\nthither.”  “Joan,” said the Bishop of Castres, Christopher d’Harcourt,\r\nthe king’s confessor, “cannot you tell the king what pricketh you?”\r\n “Ah!  I see,” replied Joan, with some embarrassment: “well, I will tell\r\nyou.  I had set me to prayer, according to my wont, and I was making\r\ncomplaint for that you would not believe what I said; then the voice came\r\nand said unto me, ‘Go, go, my daughter; I will be a help to thee; go.’\r\nWhen this voice comes to me, I feel marvellously rejoiced; I would that\r\nit might endure forever.”  She was eager and overcome.\r\n\r\nJoan and her voices were not alone in urging the king to shake off his\r\ndoubts and his indolence.  In church, and court, and army, allies were\r\nnot wanting to the pious and valiant maid.  In a written document dated\r\nthe 14th of May, six days after the siege of Orleans was raised, the most\r\nChristian doctor of the age, as Gerson was called, sifted the question\r\nwhether it were possible, whether it were a duty, to believe in the Maid.\r\n“Even if (which God forbid),” said he, “she should be mistaken in her\r\nhope and ours, it would not necessarily follow that what she does comes\r\nof the evil spirit, and not of God, but that rather our ingratitude was\r\nto blame.  Let the party which hath a just cause take care how, by\r\nincredulity or injustice, it rendereth useless the divine succor so\r\nmiraculously manifested, for God, without any change of counsel, changeth\r\nthe upshot according to deserts.”  Great lords and simple gentlemen, old\r\nand young warriors, were eager to go and join Joan for the salvation of\r\nthe king and of France.  The constable, De Richemont, banished from the\r\ncourt through the jealous hatred of George la Tremoille, made a pressing\r\napplication there, followed by a body of men-at-arms; and, when the king\r\nrefused to see him, he resolved, though continuing in disgrace, to take\r\nan active part in the war.  The young Duke of Alencon, who had been a\r\nprisoner with the English since the battle of Agincourt, hurried on the\r\npayment of his ransom in order to accompany Joan as lieutenant-general of\r\nthe king in the little army which was forming.  His wife, the duchess,\r\nwas in grief about it.  “We have just spent great sums,” said she, “in\r\nbuying him back from the English; if he would take my advice, he would\r\nstay at home.”  “Madame,” said Joan, “I will bring him back to you safe\r\nand sound, nay, even in better contentment than at present; be not\r\nafraid.”  And on this promise the duchess took heart.  Du Guesciin’s\r\nwidow, Joan de Laval, was still living; and she had two grandsons, Guy\r\nand Andrew de Laval, who were amongst the most zealous of those taking\r\nservice in the army destined to march on Rheims.  The king, to all\r\nappearance, desired to keep them near his person.  “God forbid that I\r\nshould do so,” wrote Guy de Laval, on the 8th of June, 1429, to those\r\nmost dread dames, his grandmother and his mother; “my brother says, as\r\nalso my lord the Duke d’Alencon, that a good riddance of bad rubbish\r\nwould he be who should stay at home.”  And he describes his first\r\ninterview with the Maid as follows: “The king had sent for her to come\r\nand meet him at Selles-en-Berry.  Some say that it was for my sake, in\r\norder that I might see her.  She gave right good cheer (a kind reception)\r\nto my brother and myself; and after we had dismounted at Selles I went to\r\nsee her in her quarters.  She ordered wine, and told me that she would\r\nsoon have me drinking some at Paris.  It seems a thing divine to look on\r\nher and listen to her.  I saw her mount on horseback, armed all in white\r\narmor, save her head, and with a little axe in her hand, on a great black\r\ncharger, which, at the door of her quarters, was very restive, and would\r\nnot let her mount.  Then said she, ‘Lead him to the cross,’ which was in\r\nfront of the neighboring church, on the road.  There she mounted him\r\nwithout his moving, and as if he were tied up; and turning towards the\r\ndoor of the church, which was very nigh at hand, she said, in quite a\r\nwomanly voice, ‘You, priests and church-men, make procession and prayers\r\nto God.’  Then she resumed her road, saying, ‘Push forward, push\r\nforward.’  She told me that three days before my arrival she had sent\r\nyou, dear grand-mother, a little golden ring, but that it was a very\r\nsmall matter, and she would have liked to send you something better,\r\nhaving regard to your estimation.”\r\n\r\nIt was amidst this burst of patriotism, and with all these valiant\r\ncomrades, that Joan recommenced the campaign on the 10th of June, 1429,\r\nquite resolved to bring the king to Rheims.  To complete the deliverance\r\nof Orleans, an attack was begun upon the neighboring places, Jargeau,\r\nMeung, and Beaugency.  Before Jargeau, on the 12th of June, although it\r\nwas Sunday, Joan had the trumpets sounded for the assault.  The Duke\r\nd’Alencon thought it was too soon.  “Ah!” said Joan, “be not doubtful; it\r\nis the hour pleasing to God; work ye, and God will work.”  And she added,\r\nfamiliarly, “Art thou afeard, gentle duke?  Knowest thou not that I have\r\npromised thy wife to take thee back safe and sound?”  The assault began;\r\nand Joan soon had occasion to keep her promise.  The Duke d’Alencon was\r\nwatching the assault from an exposed spot, and Joan remarked a piece\r\npointed at this spot.  “Get you hence,” said she to the duke; “yonder is\r\na piece which will slay you.”  The Duke moved, and a moment afterwards\r\nSire de Lude was killed at the self-same place by a shot from the said\r\npiece.  Jargeau was taken.  Before Beaugency a serious incident took\r\nplace.  The constable, De Richemont, came up with a force of twelve\r\nhundred men.  When he was crossing to Loudun, Charles VII., swayed as\r\never by the jealous La Tremoille, had word sent to him to withdraw, and\r\nthat if he advanced he would be attacked.  “What I am doing in the\r\nmatter,” said the constable, “is for the good of the king and the realm;\r\nif anybody comes to attack me, we shall see.”  When he had joined the\r\narmy before Beaugency, the Duke d’Alencon was much troubled.  The king’s\r\norders were precise, and Joan herself hesitated.  But news came that\r\nTalbot and the English were approaching.  “Now,” said Joan, “we must\r\nthink no more of anything but helping one another.”  She rode forward to\r\nmeet the constable, and saluted him courteously.  “Joan,” said he, “I was\r\ntold that you meant to attack me; I know not whether you come from God or\r\nnot; if you are from God, I fear you not at all, for God knows my good\r\nwill; if you are from the devil, I fear you still less.”  He remained,\r\nand Beaugency was taken.  The English army came up.  Sir John Falstolf\r\nhad joined Talbot.  Some disquietude showed itself amongst the French, so\r\nroughly handled for some time past in pitched battles.  “Ah! fair\r\nconstable,” said Joan to Richemont, “you are not come by my orders, but\r\nyou are right welcome.”  The Duke d’Alencon consulted Joan as to what was\r\nto be done.  “It will be well to have horses,” was suggested by those\r\nabout her.  She asked her neighbors, “Have you good spurs?”  “Ha!” cried\r\nthey, “must we fly, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, surely,” replied Joan: “but there will be need to ride boldly; we\r\nshall give a good account of the English, and our spurs will serve us\r\nfamously in pursuing them.”  The battle began on the 18th of June, at\r\nPatay, between Orleans and Chateaudun.  By Joan’s advice, the French\r\nattacked.  “In the name of God,” said she, “we must fight.  Though the\r\nEnglish were suspended from the clouds, we should have them, for God hath\r\nsent us to punish them.  The gentle king shall have to-day the greatest\r\nvictory he has ever had; my counsel hath told me they are ours.”  The\r\nEnglish lost heart, in their turn; the battle was short, and the victory\r\nbrilliant; Lord Talbot and the most part of the English captains remained\r\nprisoners.  “Lord Talbot,” said the Duke d’Alencon to him, “this is not\r\nwhat you expected this morning.”  “It is the fortune of war,” answered\r\nTalbot, with the cool dignity of an old warrior.  Joan’s immediate return\r\nto Orleans was a triumph; but even triumph has its embarrassments and\r\nperils.  She demanded the speedy march of the army upon Rheims, that the\r\nking might be crowned there without delay; but objections were raised on\r\nall sides, the objections of the timid and those of the jealous.  “By\r\nreason of Joan the Maid,” says a contemporary chronicler, “so many folks\r\ncame from all parts unto the king for to serve him at their own expense,\r\nthat La Tremoille and others of the council were much wroth thereat,\r\nthrough anxiety for their own persons.”  Joan, impatient and irritated at\r\nso much hesitation and intrigue, took upon herself to act as if the\r\ndecision belonged to her.  On the 25th of June she wrote to the\r\ninhabitants of Tournai, “Loyal Frenchmen, I do pray and require you to be\r\nall ready to come to the coronation of the gentle King Charles, at\r\nRheims, where we shall shortly be, and to come and meet us when ye shall\r\nlearn that we are approaching.”  Two days afterwards, on the 27th of\r\nJune, she left Gien, where the court was, and went to take up her\r\nquarters in the open country with the troops.  There was nothing for it\r\nbut to follow her.  On the 29th of June, the king, the court (including\r\nLa Tremoille), and the army, about twelve thousand strong, set out on the\r\nmarch for Rheims.  Other obstacles were encountered on the road.  In most\r\nof the towns the inhabitants, even the royalists, feared to compromise\r\nthemselves by openly pronouncing against the English and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy.  Those of Auxerre demanded a truce, offering provisions, and\r\npromising to do as those of Troyes, Chalons, and Rheims should do.  At\r\nTroyes the difficulty was greater still.  There was in it a garrison of\r\nfive or six hundred English and Burgundians, who had the burgesses under\r\ntheir thumbs.  All attempts at accommodation failed.  There was great\r\nperplexity in the royal camp; there were neither provisions enough for a\r\nlong stay before Troyes, nor batteries and siege trains to carry it by\r\nforce.  There was talk of turning back.  One of the king’s councillors,\r\nRobert le Macon, proposed that Joan should be summoned to the council.\r\nIt was at her instance that the expedition had been undertaken; she had\r\ngreat influence amongst the army and the populace; the idea ought not to\r\nbe given up without consulting her.  Whilst he was speaking, Joan came\r\nknocking at the door; she was told to come in; and the chancellor, the\r\nArchbishop of Rheims, put the question to her.  Joan, turning to the\r\nking, asked him if he would believe her.  “Speak,” said the king; “if you\r\nsay what is reasonable and tends to profit, readily will you be\r\nbelieved.”  “Gentle king of France,” said Joan, “if you be willing to\r\nabide here before your town of Troyes, it shall be at your disposal\r\nwithin two days, by love or by force; make no doubt of it.”  “Joan,”\r\n replied the chancellor, “whoever could be certain of having it within six\r\ndays might well wait for it; but say you true?”  Joan repeated her\r\nassertion; and it was decided to wait.  Joan mounted her horse, and, with\r\nher banner in her hand, she went through the camp, giving orders\r\neverywhere to prepare for the assault.  She had her own tent pitched\r\nclose to the ditch, “doing more,” says a contemporary, “than two of the\r\nablest captains would have done.”  On the next day, July 10, all was\r\nready.  Joan had the fascines thrown into the ditches, and was shouting\r\nout, “Assault!” when the inhabitants of Troyes, burgesses and\r\nmen-at-arms, came demanding permission to capitulate.  The conditions\r\nwere easy.  The inhabitants obtained for themselves and their property\r\nsuch guarantees as they desired; and the strangers were allowed to go out\r\nwith what belonged to them.  On the morrow, July 11, the king entered\r\nTroyes with all his captains, and at his side the Maid carrying her\r\nbanner.  All the difficulties of the journey were surmounted.  On the\r\n15th of July the Bishop of Chalons brought the keys of his town to the\r\nking, who took up his quarters there.  Joan found there four or five of\r\nher own villagers, who had hastened up to see the young girl of Domremy\r\nin all her glory.  She received them with a satisfaction in which\r\nfamiliarity was blended with gravity.  To one of them, her godfather, she\r\ngave a red cap which she had worn; to another, who had been a Burgundian,\r\nshe said, “I fear but one thing--treachery.”  In the Duke d’Alencon’s\r\npresence she repeated to the king, “Make good use of my time, for I shall\r\nhardly last longer than a year.”  On the 16th of July King Charles\r\nentered Rheims, and the ceremony of his coronation was fixed for the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nIt was solemn and emotional, as are all old national traditions which\r\nrecur after a forced suspension.  Joan rode between Dunois and the\r\nArchbishop of Rheims, chancellor of France.  The air resounded with the\r\nTe Deum sung with all their hearts by clergy and crowd.  “In God’s name,”\r\n said Joan to Dunois, “here is a good people and a devout when I die, I\r\nshould much like it to be in these parts.”  “Joan,” inquired Dunois,\r\n“know you when you will die, and in what place?”  “I know not,” said she,\r\n“for I am at the will of God.”  Then she added, “I have accomplished that\r\nwhich my Lord commanded me, to raise the siege of Orleans and have the\r\ngentle king crowned.  I would like it well if it should please him to\r\nsend me back to my father and mother, to keep their sheep and their\r\ncattle, and do that which was my wont.”  “When the said lords,” says the\r\nchronicler, an eye-witness, “heard these words of Joan, who, with eyes\r\ntowards heaven, gave thanks to God, they the more believed that it was\r\nsomewhat sent from God, and not otherwise.”\r\n\r\nHistorians, and even contemporaries, have given much discussion to the\r\nquestion whether Joan of Arc, according to her first ideas, had really\r\nlimited her design to the raising of the siege of Orleans and the\r\ncoronation of Charles VII. at Rheims.  She had said so herself several\r\ntimes, just as she had to Dunois at Rheims on the 17th of July, 1429; but\r\nshe sometimes also spoke of more vast and varied projects, as, for\r\ninstance, driving the English completely out of France, and withdrawing\r\nfrom his long captivity Charles, Duke of Orleans.  He had been a prisoner\r\nin London ever since the battle of Agincourt, and was popular in his day,\r\nas he has continued to be in French history, on the double ground of\r\nhaving been the father of Louis XII. and one of the most charming poets\r\nin the ancient literature of France.  The Duke d’Alencon, who was so high\r\nin the regard of Joan, attributed to her more expressly this quadruple\r\ndesign: “She said,” according to him, “that she had four duties; to get\r\nrid of the English, to have the king anointed and crowned, to deliver\r\nDuke Charles of Orleans, and to raise the siege laid by the English to\r\nOrleans.”  One is inclined to believe that Joan’s language to Dunois at\r\nRheims in the hour of Charles VII.’s coronation more accurately expressed\r\nher first idea; the two other notions occurred to her naturally in\r\nproportion as her hopes as well as her power kept growing greater with\r\nsuccess.  But however lofty and daring her soul may have been, she had a\r\nsimple and not at all a fantastic mind.  She may have foreseen the\r\ncomplete expulsion of the English, and may have desired the deliverance\r\nof the Duke of Orleans, without having in the first instance premeditated\r\nanything more than she said to Dunois during the king’s coronation at\r\nRheims, which was looked upon by her as the triumph of the national\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, when Orleans was relieved, and Charles VII.\r\ncrowned, the situation, posture, and part of Joan underwent a change.\r\nShe no longer manifested the same confidence in herself and her designs.\r\nShe no longer exercised over those in whose midst she lived the same\r\nauthority.  She continued to carry on war, but at hap-hazard, sometimes\r\nwith and sometimes without success, just like La Hire and Dunois; never\r\ndiscouraged, never satisfied, and never looking upon her-self as\r\ntriumphant.  After the coronation, her advice was to march at once upon\r\nParis, in order to take up a fixed position in it, as being the political\r\ncentre of the realm of which Rheims was the religious.  Nothing of the\r\nsort was done.  Charles and La Tremoille once more began their course of\r\nhesitation, tergiversation, and changes of tactics and residence without\r\ndoing anything of a public and decisive character.  They negotiated with\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, in the hope of detaching him from the English\r\ncause; and they even concluded with him a secret, local, and temporary\r\ntruce.  From the 20th of July to the 23d of August Joan followed the king\r\nwhithersoever he went, to Chateau-Thierry, to Senlis, to Blois, to\r\nProvins, and to Compigne, as devoted as ever, but without having her\r\nformer power.  She was still active, but not from inspiration and to obey\r\nher voices, simply to promote the royal policy.  She wrote the Duke of\r\nBurgundy a letter full of dignity and patriotism, which had no more\r\neffect than the negotiations of La Tremoille.  During this fruitless\r\nlabor amongst the French the Duke of Bedford sent for five thousand men\r\nfrom England, who came and settled themselves at Paris.  One division of\r\nthis army had a white standard, in the middle of which was depicted a\r\ndistaff full of cotton; a half-filled spindle was hanging to the distaff;\r\nand the field, studded with empty spindles, bore this inscription: “Now,\r\nfair one, come!”  Insult to Joan was accompanied by redoubled war against\r\nFrance.  Joan, saddened and wearied by the position of things, attempted\r\nto escape from it by a bold stroke.  On the 23d of August, 1429, she set\r\nout from Compiegne with the Duke d’Alencon and “a fair company of\r\nmen-at-arms;” and suddenly went and occupied St. Denis, with the view of\r\nattacking Paris.  Charles VII. felt himself obliged to quit Compiegne\r\nlikewise, “and went, greatly against the grain,” says a contemporary\r\nchronicler, “as far as into the town of Senlis.”  The attack on Paris\r\nbegan vigorously.  Joan, with the Duke d’Alencon, pitched her camp at La\r\nChapelle.  Charles took up his abode in the abbey of St. Denis.  The\r\nmunicipal corporation of Paris received letters with the arms of the Duke\r\nd’Alencon, which called upon them to recognize the king’s authority, and\r\npromised a general amnesty.  The assault was delivered on the 8th of\r\nSeptember.  Joan was severely wounded, but she insisted upon remaining\r\nwhere she was.  Night came, and the troops had not entered the breach\r\nwhich had been opened in the morning.  Joan was still calling out to\r\npersevere.  The Duke d’Alencon himself begged her, but in vain, to\r\nretire.  La Tremoille gave orders to retreat; and some knights came up,\r\nset Joan on horse-back, and led her back, against her will, to La\r\nChapelle.  “By my martin” (staff of command), said she, “the place would\r\nhave been taken.”  One hope still remained.  In concert with the Duke\r\nd’Alencon she had caused a flying bridge to be thrown across the Seine\r\nopposite St. Denis.  The next day but one she sent her vanguard in this\r\ndirection; she intended to return thereby to the siege; but, by the\r\nking’s order, the bridge had been cut adrift.  St. Denis fell once more\r\ninto the hands of the English.  Before leaving, Joan left there, on the\r\ntomb of St. Denis, her complete suit of armor and a sword she had lately\r\nobtained possession of at the St. Honore gate of Paris, as trophy of war.\r\n\r\nFrom the 13th of September, 1429, to the 24th of May, 1430, she continued\r\nto lead the same life of efforts ever equally valiant and equally\r\nineffectual.  She failed in an attempt upon Laemir.  Charite-sur-Loire,\r\nundertaken, for all that appears, with the sole design of recovering an\r\nimportant town in the possession of the enemy.  The English evacuated\r\nParis, and left the keeping of it to the Duke of Burgundy, no doubt to\r\ntest his fidelity.  On the 13th of Aprils 1430, at the expiration of the\r\ntruce he had concluded, Philip the Good resumed hostilities against\r\nCharles VII.  Joan of Arc once more plunged into them with her wonted\r\nzeal.  Ile-de-France and Picardy became the theatre of war.  Compiegne\r\nwas regarded as the gate of the road between these two provinces; and the\r\nDuke of Burgundy attached much importance to holding the key of it.  The\r\nauthority of Charles VII. was recognized there; and a young knight of\r\nCompiegne, William de Flavy, held the command there as lieutenant of La\r\nTremoille, who had got himself appointed captain of the town.  La\r\nTremoille attempted to treat with the Duke of Burgundy for the cession of\r\nCompiegne; but the inhabitants were strenuously opposed to it.  “They\r\nwere,” they said, “the king’s most humble subjects, and they desired to\r\nserve him with body and substance; but as for trusting themselves to the\r\nlord Duke of Burgundy, they could not do it; they were resolved to suffer\r\ndestruction, themselves and their wives and children, rather than be\r\nexposed to the tender mercies of the said duke.”  Meanwhile Joan of Arc,\r\nafter several warlike expeditions in the neighborhood, re-entered\r\nCompiegne, and was received there with a popular expression of\r\nsatisfaction.  “She was presented,” says a local chronicler, with three\r\nhogsheads of wine, a present which was large and exceeding costly, and\r\nwhich showed the estimate formed of this maiden’s worth.”  Joan\r\nmanifested the profound distrust with which she was inspired of the Duke\r\nof Burgundy.  There is no peace possible with him,” she said, “save at\r\nthe point of the lance.”  She had quarters at the house of the king’s\r\nattorney, Le Boucher, and shared the bed of his wife, Mary.  “She often\r\nmade the said Mary rise from her bed to go and warn the said attorney to\r\nbe on his guard against several acts of Burgundian treachery.”  At this\r\nperiod, again, she said she was often warned by her voices of what must\r\nhappen to her; she expected to be taken prisoner before St. John’s or\r\nMidsummer-day (June 24); on what day and hour she did not know; she had\r\nreceived no instructions as to sorties from the place; but she had\r\nconstantly been told that she would be taken, and she was distrustful of\r\nthe captains who were in command there.  She was, nevertheless, not the\r\nless bold and enterprising.  On the 20th of May, 1430, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy came and laid siege to Compiegne.  Joan was away on an\r\nexpedition to Crepy in Valois, with a small band of three or four hundred\r\nbrave comrades.  On the 24th of May, the eve of Ascension-day, she\r\nlearned that Compiegne was being besieged, and she resolved to re-enter\r\nit.  She was reminded that her force was a very weak one to cut its way\r\nthrough the besiegers’ camp.  “By my martin,” said she, “we are enough; I\r\nwill go see my friends in Compiegne.”  She arrived about daybreak without\r\nhinderance, and penetrated into the town; and repaired immediately to the\r\nparish church of St. Jacques to perform her devotions on the eve of so\r\ngreat a festival.  Many persons, attracted by her presence, and amongst\r\nothers “from a hundred to six-score children,” thronged to the church.\r\nAfter hearing mass, and herself taking the communion, Joan said to those\r\nwho surrounded her, “My children and dear friends, I notify you that I am\r\nsold and betrayed, and that I shall shortly be delivered over to death; I\r\nbeseech you, pray God for me.”  When evening came, she was not the less\r\neager to take part in a sortie with her usual comrades and a troop of\r\nabout five hundred men.  William de Flavy, commandant of the place, got\r\nready some boats on the Oise to assist the return of the troops.  All the\r\ntown-gates were closed, save the bridge-gate.  The sortie was\r\nunsuccessful.  Being severely repulsed and all but hemmed in, the\r\nmajority of the soldiers shouted to Joan, “Try to quickly regain the\r\ntown, or we are lost.”  “Silence,” said Joan; “it only rests with you to\r\nthrow the enemy into confusion; think only of striking at them.”  Her\r\nwords and her bravery were in vain; the infantry flung themselves into\r\nthe boats, and regained the town, and Joan and her brave comrades covered\r\ntheir retreat.  The Burgundians were coming up in mass upon Compiegne,\r\nand Flavy gave orders to pull up the draw-bridge and let down the\r\nportcullis.  Joan and some of her following lingered outside, still\r\nfighting.  She wore a rich surcoat and a red sash, and all the efforts of\r\nthe Burgundians were directed against her.  Twenty men thronged round her\r\nhorse; and a Picard archer, “a tough fellow and mighty sour,” seized her\r\nby her dress, and flung her on the ground.  All, at once, called on her\r\nto surrender.  “Yield you to me,” said one of them; “pledge your faith to\r\nme; I am a gentleman.”  It was an archer of the bastard of Wandonne, one\r\nof the lieutenants of John of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny.  “I have\r\npledged my faith to one other than you,” said Joan, “and to Him I will\r\nkeep my oath.”  The archer took her and conducted her to Count John,\r\nwhose prisoner she became.\r\n\r\nWas she betrayed and delivered up, as she had predicted?  Did William de\r\nFlavy purposely have the drawbridge raised and the portcullis lowered\r\nbefore she could get back into Compiegne?  He was suspected of it at the\r\ntime, and many historians have indorsed the suspicion.  But there is\r\nnothing to prove it.  That La Tremoille, prime minister of Charles VII.,\r\nand Reginald de Chartres, Archbishop of Rheims, had an antipathy to Joan\r\nof Arc, and did all they could on every occasion to compromise her and\r\ndestroy her influence, and that they were glad to see her a prisoner, is\r\nas certain as anything can be.  On announcing her capture to the\r\ninhabitants of Rheims, the arch-bishop said, “She would not listen to\r\ncounsel, and did everything according to her pleasure.”  But there is a\r\nlong distance between such expressions and a premeditated plot to deliver\r\nto the enemy the young heroine who had just raised the siege of Orleans\r\nand brought the king to be crowned at Rheims.  History must not, without\r\nproof, impute crimes so odious and so shameful to even the most depraved\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, Joan remained for six months the prisoner of John of\r\nLuxembourg, who, to make his possession of her secure, sent her, under\r\ngood escort, successively to his two castles of Beaulieu and Beaurevoir,\r\none in the Vermandois and the other in the Cambresis.  Twice, in July and\r\nin October, 1430, Joan attempted, unsuccessfully, to escape.  The second\r\ntime she carried despair and hardihood so far as to throw herself down\r\nfrom the platform of her prison.  She was picked up cruelly bruised, but\r\nwithout any fracture or wound of importance.  Her fame, her youth, her\r\nvirtue, her courage, made her, even in her prison and in the very family\r\nof her custodian, two warm and powerful friends.  John of Luxembourg had\r\nwith him his wife, Joan of Bethune, and his aunt, Joan of Luxembourg,\r\ngodmother of Charles VII.  They both of them took a tender interest in\r\nthe prisoner; and they often went to see her, and left nothing undone to\r\nmitigate the annoyances of a prison.  One thing only shocked them about\r\nher--her man’s clothes.  “They offered her,” as Joan herself said, when\r\nquestioned upon this subject at a later period during her trial, “a\r\nwoman’s dress, or stuff to make it to her liking, and requested her to\r\nwear it; but she answered that she had not leave from our Lord, and that\r\nit was not yet time for it.”  John of Luxembourg’s aunt was full of years\r\nand reverenced as a saint.  Hearing that the English were tempting her\r\nnephew by the offer of a sum of money to give up his prisoner to them,\r\nshe conjured him in her will, dated September 10, 1430, not to sully by\r\nsuch an act the honor of his name.  But Count John was neither rich nor\r\nscrupulous; and pretexts were not wanting to aid his cupidity and his\r\nweakness.  Joan had been taken at Compiegne on the 23d of May, in the\r\nevening; and the news arrived in Paris on the 25th of May, in the\r\nmorning.  On the morrow, the 26th, the registrar of the University, in\r\nthe name and under the seal of the inquisition of France, wrote a\r\ncitation to the Duke of Burgundy “to the end that the Maid should be\r\ndelivered up to appear before the said inquisitor, and to respond to the\r\ngood counsel, favor, and aid of the good doctors and masters of the\r\nUniversity of Paris.”  Peter Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, had been the\r\nprime mover in this step.  Some weeks later, on the 14th of July, seeing\r\nthat no reply arrived from the Duke of Burgundy, he caused a renewal of\r\nthe same demands to be made on the part of the University in more urgent\r\nterms, and he added, in his own name, that Joan, having been taken at\r\nCompiegne, in his own diocese, belonged to him as judge spiritual.  He\r\nfurther asserted that “according to the law, usage, and custom of France,\r\nevery prisoner of war, even were it king, _dauphin_, or other prince,\r\nmight be redeemed in the name of the King of England in consideration of\r\nan indemnity of ten thousand livres granted to the capturer.”  Nothing\r\nwas more opposed to the common law of nations and to the feudal spirit,\r\noften grasping, but noble at bottom.  For four months still, John of\r\nLuxembourg hesitated; but his aunt, Joan, died at Boulogne, on the 13th\r\nof November, and Joan of Arc had no longer near him this powerful\r\nintercessor.  The King of England transmitted to the keeping of his\r\ncoffers at Rouen, in golden coin, English money, the sum of ten thousand\r\nlivres.  John of Luxembourg yielded to the temptation.  On the 21st of\r\nNovember, 1430, Joan of Arc was handed over to the King of England, and\r\nthe same day the University of Paris, through its rector, Hebert,\r\nbesought that sovereign, as King of France, “to order that this woman be\r\nbrought to their city for to be shortly placed in the hands of the\r\njustice of the Church, that is, of our honored lord, the Bishop and Count\r\nof Beauvais, and also of the ordained inquisitor in France, in order that\r\nher trial may be conducted officially and securely.”\r\n\r\nIt was not to Paris, but to Rouen, the real capital of the English in\r\nFrance, that Joan was taken.  She arrived there on the 23d of December,\r\n1430.  On the 3d of January, 1431, an order from Henry VI., King of\r\nEngland, placed her in the hands of the Bishop of Beauvais, Peter\r\nCauchon.  Some days afterwards, Count John of Luxembourg, accompanied by\r\nhis brother, the English chancellor, by his esquire, and by two English\r\nlords, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and Humphrey, Earl of\r\nStafford, the King of England’s constable in France, entered the prison.\r\nHad John of Luxembourg come out of sheer curiosity, or to relieve himself\r\nof certain scruples by offering Joan a chance for her life?  “Joan,” said\r\nhe, “I am come hither to put you to ransom, and to treat for the price of\r\nyour deliverance; only give us your promise here to no more bear arms\r\nagainst us.”  “In God’s name,” answered Joan, “are you making a mock of\r\nme, captain?  Ransom me!  You have neither the will nor the power; no,\r\nyou have neither.”  The count persisted.  “I know well,” said Joan, “that\r\nthese English will put me to death; but were they a hundred thousand more\r\nGoddams than have already been in France, they shall never have the\r\nkingdom.”\r\n\r\nAt this patriotic burst on the heroine’s part, the Earl of Stafford half\r\ndrew his dagger from the sheath as if to strike Joan, but the Earl of\r\nWarwick held him back.  The visitors went out from the prison and handed\r\nover Joan to the judges.\r\n\r\nThe court of Rouen was promptly formed, but not without opposition and\r\ndifficulty.  Though Joan had lost somewhat of her greatness and\r\nimportance by going beyond her main object, and by showing recklessness,\r\nunattended by success, on small occasions, she still remained the true,\r\nheroic representative of the feelings and wishes of the nation.  When she\r\nwas removed from Beaurevoir to Rouen, all the places at which she stopped\r\nwere like so many luminous points for the illustration of her popularity.\r\nAt Arras, a Scot showed her a portrait of her which he wore, an outward\r\nsign of the devoted worship of her lieges.  At Amiens, the chancellor of\r\nthe cathedral gave her audience at confession and administered to her the\r\neucharist.  At Abbeville, ladies of distinction went five leagues to pay\r\nher a visit; they were glad to have had the happiness of seeing her so\r\nfirm and resigned to the will of Our Lord; they wished her all the favors\r\nof heaven, and then wept affectionately on taking leave of her.  Joan,\r\ntouched by their sympathy and open heartedness, said, “Ah! what a good\r\npeople is this!  Would to God I might be so happy, when my days are\r\nended, as to be buried in these parts!”\r\n\r\nWhen the Bishop of Beauvais, installed at Rouen, set about forming his\r\ncourt of justice, the majority of the members he appointed amongst the\r\nclergy or the University of Paris obeyed the summons without hesitation.\r\nSome few would have refused; but their wishes were overruled.  The Abbot\r\nof Jumieges, Nicholas de Houppeville, maintained that the trial was not\r\nlegal.  The Bishop of Beauvais, he said, belonged to the party which\r\ndeclared itself hostile to the Maid; and, besides, he made himself judge\r\nin a case already decided by his metropolitan, the Archbishop of Rheims,\r\nof whom Beauvais was holden, and who had approved of Joan’s conduct.  The\r\nbishop summoned before him the recalcitrant, who refused to appear,\r\nsaying that he was under no official jurisdiction but that of Rouen.  He\r\nwas arrested and thrown into prison, by order of the bishop, whose\r\nauthority he denied.  There was some talk of banishing him, and even of\r\nthrowing him into the river; but the influence of his brethren saved him.\r\nThe sub-inquisitor himself allowed the trial in which he was to be one of\r\nthe judges to begin without him; and he only put in an appearance at the\r\nexpress order of the inquisitor-general, and on a confidential hint that\r\nhe would be in danger of his life if he persisted in his refusal.  The\r\ncourt being thus constituted, Joan, after it had been put in possession\r\nof the evidence already collected, was cited, on the 20th of February,\r\n1431, to appear on the morrow, the 21st, before her judges assembled in\r\nthe chapel of Rouen Castle.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted from the 21st of February to the 30th of May, 1431.  The\r\ncourt held forty sittings, mostly in the chapel of the castle, some in\r\nJoan’s very prison.  On her arrival there, she had been put in an iron\r\ncage; afterwards she was kept no longer in the cage, but in a dark room\r\nin a tower of the castle, wearing irons upon her feet, fastened by a\r\nchain to a large piece of wood, and guarded night and day by four or five\r\n“soldiers of low grade.”  She complained of being thus chained; but the\r\nbishop told her that her former attempts at escape demanded this\r\nprecaution.  “It is true,” said Joan, as truthful as heroic, “I did wish\r\nand I still wish to escape from prison, as is the right of every\r\nprisoner.”  At her examination, the bishop required her to take an oath\r\nto tell the truth about everything as to which she should be questioned.”\r\n “I know not what you mean to question me about; perchance you may ask me\r\nthings I would not tell you; touching my revelations, for instance, you\r\nmight ask me to tell something I have sworn not to tell; thus I should be\r\nperjured, which you ought not to desire.”  The bishop insisted upon an\r\noath absolute and with-out condition.  “You are too hard on me,” said\r\nJoan; I do not like to take an oath to tell the truth save as to matters\r\nwhich concern the faith.”  The bishop called upon her to swear on pain of\r\nbeing held guilty of the things imputed to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joan examined in Prison----128]\r\n\r\n“Go on to something else,” said she.  And this was the answer she made to\r\nall questions which seemed to her to be a violation of her right to be\r\nsilent.  Wearied and hurt at these imperious demands, she one day said,\r\n“I come on God’s business, and I have nought to do here; send me back to\r\nGod, from whom I come.”  “Are you sure you are in God’s grace?” asked the\r\nbishop.  “If I be not,” answered Joan, “please God to bring me to it; and\r\nif I be, please God to keep me in it!”  The bishop himself remained\r\ndumbfounded.\r\n\r\nThere is no object in following through all its sittings and all its\r\ntwistings this odious and shameful trial, in which the judges’ prejudiced\r\nservility and scientific subtlety were employed for three months to wear\r\nout the courage or overreach the understanding of a young girl of\r\nnineteen, who refused at one time to lie, and at another to enter into\r\ndiscussion with them, and made no defence beyond holding her tongue or\r\nappealing to God who had spoken to her and dictated to her that which she\r\nhad done.  In order to force her from her silence or bring her to submit\r\nto the Church instead of appealing from it to God, it was proposed to\r\nemploy the last means of all, torture.  On the 9th of May the bishop had\r\nJoan brought into the great tower of Rouen Castle; the instruments of\r\ntorture were displayed before her eyes; and the executioners were ready\r\nto fulfil their office, “for to bring her back,” said the bishop, “into\r\nthe ways of truth, in order to insure the salvation of her soul and body,\r\nso gravely endangered by erroneous inventions.”  “Verily,” answered Joan,\r\n“if you should have to tear me limb from limb, and separate soul from\r\nbody, I should not tell you aught else; and if I were to tell you aught\r\nelse, I should afterwards still tell you that you had made me tell it by\r\nforce.”  The idea of torture was given up.  It was resolved to display\r\nall the armory of science in order to subdue the mind of this young girl,\r\nwhose conscience was not to be subjugated.  The chapter of Rouen declared\r\nthat in consequence of her public refusal to submit herself to the\r\ndecision of the Church as to her deeds and her statements, Joan deserved\r\nto be declared a heretic.  The University of Paris, to which had been\r\nhanded in the twelve heads of accusation resulting from Joan’s statements\r\nand examinations, replied that “if, having been charitably admonished,\r\nshe would not make reparation and return to union with the Catholic\r\nfaith, she must be left to the secular judges to undergo punishment for\r\nher crime.”  Armed with these documents the Bishop of Beauvais had Joan\r\nbrought up, on the 23d of May, in a hall adjoining her prison, and, after\r\nhaving addressed to her a long exhortation, “Joan,” said he, “if in the\r\ndominions of your king, when you were at large in them, a knight or any\r\nother, born under his rule and allegiance to him, had risen up, saying,\r\n‘I will not obey the king or submit to his officers,’ would you not have\r\nsaid that he ought to be condemned?  What then will you say of yourself,\r\nyou who were born in the faith of Christ and became by baptism a daughter\r\nof the Church and spouse of Jesus Christ, if you obey not the officers of\r\nChrist, that is, the prelates of the Church?” Joan listened modestly to\r\nthis admonition, and confined herself to answering, “As to my deeds and\r\nsayings, what I said of them at the trial I do hold to and mean to abide\r\nby.”  “Think you that you are not bound to submit your sayings and deeds\r\nto the Church militant or to any other than God?”  “The course that I\r\nalways mentioned and pursued at the trial I mean to maintain as to that.\r\nIf I were at the stake, and saw the torch lighted, and the executioner\r\nready to set fire to the fagots, even if I were in the midst of the\r\nflames, I should not say aught else, and I should uphold that which I\r\nsaid at the trial even unto death.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws, ideas, and practices of the time the legal\r\nquestion was decided.  Joan, declared heretic and rebellious by the\r\nChurch, was liable to have sentence pronounced against her; but she had\r\npersisted in her statements, she had shown no submission.  Although she\r\nappeared to be quite forgotten, and was quite neglected by the king whose\r\ncoronation she had effected, by his councillors, and even by the brave\r\nwarriors at whose side she had fought, the public exhibited a lively\r\ninterest in her; accounts of the scenes which took place at her trial\r\nwere inquired after with curiosity.  Amongst the very judges who\r\nprosecuted her, many were troubled in spirit, and wished that Joan, by an\r\nabjuration of her statements, would herself put them at ease and relieve\r\nthem from pronouncing against her the most severe penalty.  What means\r\nwere employed to arrive at this end?  Did she really, and with full\r\nknowledge of what she was about, come round to the adjuration which there\r\nwas so much anxiety to obtain from her?  It is difficult to solve this\r\nhistorical problem with exactness and certainty.  More than once, during\r\nthe examinations and the conversations which took place at that time\r\nbetween Joan and her judges, she maintained her firm posture and her\r\nfirst statements.  One of those who were exhorting her to yield said to\r\nher one day, “Thy king is a heretic and a schismatic.”  Joan could not\r\nbrook this insult to her king.  “By my faith,” said she, “full well dare\r\nI both say and swear that he is the noblest Christian of all Christians,\r\nand the truest lover of the faith and the Church.”  “Make her hold her\r\ntongue,” said the usher to the preacher, who was disconcerted at having\r\nprovoked such language.  Another day, when Joan was being urged to submit\r\nto the Church, brother Isambard de la Pierre, a Dominican, who was\r\ninterested in her, spoke to her about the council, at the same time\r\nexplaining to her its province in the church.  It was the very time when\r\nthat of Bale had been convoked.  “Ah!” said Joan, “I would fain surrender\r\nand submit myself to the council of Bale.”  The Bishop of Beauvais\r\ntrembled at the idea of this appeal.  “Hold your tongue in the devil’s\r\nname!” said he to the monk.  Another of the judges, William Erard, asked\r\nJoan menacingly, “Will you abjure those reprobate words and deeds of\r\nyours?”  “I leave it to the universal Church whether I ought to abjure or\r\nnot.”  “That is not enough: you shall abjure at once or you shall burn.”\r\n Joan shuddered.  “I would rather sign than burn,” she said.  There was\r\nput before her a form of abjuration, whereby, disavowing her revelations\r\nand visions from heaven, she confessed her errors in matters of faith,\r\nand renounced them humbly.  At the bottom of the document she made the\r\nmark of a cross.  Doubts have arisen as to the genuineness of this long\r\nand diffuse deed in the form in which it has been published in the\r\ntrial-papers.  Twenty-four years later, in 1455, during the trial\r\nundertaken for the rehabilitation of Joan, several of those who had been\r\npresent at the trial at which she was condemned, amongst others the usher\r\nMassieu and the registrar Taquel, declared that the form of abjuration\r\nread out at that time to Joan and signed by her contained only seven or\r\neight lines of big writing; and according to another witness of the scene\r\nit was an Englishman, John Calot, secretary of Henry VI., King of\r\nEngland, who, as soon as Joan had yielded, drew from his sleeve a little\r\npaper which he gave to her to sign, and, dissatisfied with the mark she\r\nhad made, held her hand and guided it so that she might put down her\r\nname, every letter.  However that may be, as soon as Joan’s abjuration\r\nhad thus been obtained, the court issued on the 24th of May, 1431, a\r\ndefinitive decree, whereby, after some long and severe strictures in the\r\npreamble, it condemned Joan to perpetual imprisonment, “with the bread of\r\naffliction and the water of affliction, in order that she might deplore\r\nthe errors and faults she had committed, and relapse into them no more\r\nhenceforth.”\r\n\r\nThe Church might be satisfied; but the King of England, his councillors\r\nand his officers, were not.  It was Joan living, even though a prisoner,\r\nthat they feared.  They were animated towards her by the two ruthless\r\npassions of vengeance and fear.  When it was known that she would escape\r\nwith her life, murmurs broke out amongst the crowd of enemies present at\r\nthe trial.  Stones were thrown at the judges.  One of the Cardinal of\r\nWinchester’s chaplains, who happened to be close to the Bishop of\r\nBeauvais, called him traitor.  “You lie,” said the bishop.  And the\r\nbishop was right; the chaplain did lie; the bishop had no intention of\r\nbetraying his masters.  The Earl of Warwick complained to him of the\r\ninadequacy of the sentence.  “Never you mind, my lord,” said one of Peter\r\nCauchon’s confidants; “we will have her up again.”  After the passing of\r\nher sentence Joan had said to those about her, “Come, now, you churchmen\r\namongst you, lead me off to your own prisons, and let me be no more in\r\nthe hands of the English.”  “Lead her to where you took her,” said the\r\nbishop; and she was conducted to the castle prison.  She had been told by\r\nsome of the judges who went to see her after her sentence, that she would\r\nhave to give up her man’s dress and resume her woman’s clothing, as the\r\nChurch ordained.  She was rejoiced thereat; forthwith, accordingly,\r\nresumed her woman’s clothes, and had her hair properly cut, which up to\r\nthat time she used to wear clipped round like a man’s.  When she was\r\ntaken back to prison, the man’s dress which she had worn was put in a\r\nsack in the same room in which she was confined, and she remained in\r\ncustody at the said place in the hands of five Englishmen, of whom three\r\nstaid by night in the room and two outside at the door.  “And he who\r\nspeaks [John Massieu, a priest, the same who in 1431 had been present as\r\nusher of the court at the trial in which Joan was condemned] knows for\r\ncertain that at night she had her legs ironed in such sort that she could\r\nnot stir from the spot.  When the next Sunday morning, which was Trinity\r\nSunday, had come, and she should have got up, according to what she\r\nherself told to him who speaks, she said to her English guards, ‘Uniron\r\nme; I will get up.’  Then one of then took away her woman’s clothes; they\r\nemptied the sack in which was her man’s dress, and pitched the said dress\r\nto her, saying, ‘Get up, then,’ and they put her woman’s clothes in the\r\nsame sack.  And according to what she told me she only clad herself in\r\nher man’s dress after saying, ‘You know it is forbidden me; I certainly\r\nwill not take it.’ Nevertheless they would not allow her any other;\r\ninsomuch that the dispute lasted to the hour of noon.  Finally, from\r\ncorporeal necessity, Joan was constrained to get up and take the dress.”\r\n\r\nThe official documents drawn up during the condemnation-trial contain\r\nquite a different account.  “On the 28th of May,” it is there said,\r\n“eight of the judges who had taken part in the sentence [their names are\r\ngiven in the document, t. i. p. 454] betook themselves to Joan’s prison,\r\nand seeing her clad in man’s dress, ‘which she had but just given up\r\naccording to our order that she should resume woman’s clothes, we asked\r\nher when and for what cause she had resumed this dress, and who had\r\nprevailed on her to do so.  Joan answered that it was of her own will,\r\nwithout any constraint from any one, and because she preferred that dress\r\nto woman’s clothes.  To our question as to why she had made this change,\r\nshe answered, that, being surrounded by men, man’s dress was more\r\nsuitable for her than woman’s.  She also said that she had resumed it\r\nbecause there had been made to her, but not kept, a promise that she\r\nshould go to mass, receive the body of Christ, and be set free from her\r\nfetters.  She added that if this promise were kept, she would be good,\r\nand would do what was the will of the Church.  As we had heard some\r\npersons say that she persisted in her errors as to the pretended\r\nrevelations which she had but lately renounced, we asked whether she had\r\nsince Thursday last heard the voices of St. Catherine and St. Margaret;\r\nand she answered, Yes.  To our question as to what the saints had said\r\nshe answered, that God had testified to her by their voices great pity\r\nfor the great treason she had committed in abjuring for the sake of\r\nsaving her life, and that by so doing she had damned herself.  She said\r\nthat all she had thus done last Thursday in abjuring her visions and\r\nrevelations she had done through fear of the stake, and that all her\r\nabjuration was contrary to the truth.  She added that she did not herself\r\ncomprehend what was contained in the form of abjuration she had been made\r\nto sign, and that she would rather do penance once for all by dying to\r\nmaintain the truth than remain any longer a prisoner, being all the while\r\na traitress to it.”\r\n\r\nWe will not stop to examine whether these two accounts, though very\r\ndifferent, are not fundamentally reconcilable, and whether Joan resumed\r\nman’s dress of her own desire or was constrained to do so by the soldiers\r\non guard over her, and perhaps to escape from their insults.  The\r\nimportant points in the incident are the burst of remorse which Joan felt\r\nfor her weakness and her striking retractation of the abjuration which\r\nhad been wrung from her.  So soon as the news was noised abroad, her\r\nenemies cried, “She has relapsed!” This was exactly what they had hoped\r\nfor when, on learning that she had been sentenced only to perpetual\r\nimprisonment, they had said, “Never you mind; we will have her up again.”\r\n “_Farewell, farewell_, my lord,” said the Bishop of Beauvais to the Earl\r\nof Warwick, whom he met shortly after Joan’s retractation; and in his\r\nwords there was plainly an expression of satisfaction, and not a mere\r\nphrase of politeness.  On the 29th of May the tribunal met again.  Forty\r\njudges took part in the deliberation; Joan was unanimously declared a\r\ncase of relapse, was found guilty, and cited to appear next day, the\r\n30th, on the Vieux-Marche to hear sentence pronounced, and then undergo\r\nthe punishment of the stake.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 30th of May, in the morning, the Dominican brother Martin\r\nLadvenu was charged to announce her sentence to Joan, she gave way at\r\nfirst to grief and terror.  “Alas!” she cried, “am I to be so horribly\r\nand cruelly treated that this my body, full pure and perfect and never\r\ndefiled, must to-day be consumed and reduced to ashes!  Ah!  I would\r\nseven times rather be beheaded than burned!”  The Bishop of Beauvais at\r\nthis moment came up.  “Bishop,” said Joan, “you are the cause of my\r\ndeath; if you had put me in the prisons of the Church and in the hands of\r\nfit and proper ecclesiastical warders, this had never happened; I appeal\r\nfrom you to the presence of God.”  One of the doctors who had sat in\r\njudgment upon her, Peter Maurice, went to see her, and spoke to her with\r\nsympathy.  “Master Peter,” said she to him, “where shall I be to-night?”\r\n “Have you not good hope in God?” asked the doctor.  “O! yes,” she\r\nanswered; “by the grace of God I shall be in paradise.”  Being left alone\r\nwith the Dominican, Martin Ladvenu, she confessed and asked to\r\ncommunicate.  The monk applied to the Bishop of Beauvais to know what he\r\nwas to do.  “Tell brother Martin,” was the answer, “to give her the\r\neucharist and all she asks for.”  At nine o’clock, having resumed her\r\nwoman’s dress, Joan was dragged from prison and driven to the Vieux-\r\nMarche.  From seven to eight hundred soldiers escorted the car and\r\nprohibited all approach to it on the part of the crowd, which encumbered\r\nthe road and the vicinities; but a man forced a passage and flung himself\r\ntowards Joan.  It was a canon of Rouen, Nicholas Loiseleur, whom the\r\nBishop of Beauvais had placed near her, and who had abused the confidence\r\nshe had shown him.  Beside himself with despair, he wished to ask pardon\r\nof her; but the English soldiers drove him back with violence and with\r\nthe epithet of traitor, and but for the intervention of the Earl of\r\nWarwick his life would have been in danger.  Joan wept and prayed; and\r\nthe crowd, afar off, wept and prayed with her.  On arriving at the place,\r\nshe listened in silence to a sermon by one of the doctors of the court,\r\nwho ended by saying, “Joan, go in peace; the Church can no longer defend\r\nthee; she gives thee over to the secular arm.”  The laic judges, Raoul\r\nBouteillier, baillie of Rouen, and his lieutenant, Peter Daron, were\r\nalone qualified to pronounce sentence of death; but no time was given\r\nthem.  The priest Massieu was still continuing his exhortations to Joan,\r\nbut “How now! priest,” was the cry from amidst the soldiery, “are you\r\ngoing to make us dine here?”  “Away with her!  Away with her!” said the\r\nbaillie to the guards; and to the executioner, “Do thy duty.”  When she\r\ncame to the stake, Joan knelt down completely absorbed in prayer.  She\r\nhad begged Massieu to get her a cross; and an Englishman present made one\r\nout of a little stick, and handed it to the French heroine, who took it,\r\nkissed it, and laid it on her breast.  She begged brother Isambard de la\r\nPierre to go and fetch the cross from the church of St. Sauveur, the\r\nchief door of which opened on the Vieux-Marche, and to hold it “upright\r\nbefore her eyes till the coming of death, in order,” she said, “that the\r\ncross whereon God hung might, as long as she lived, be continually in her\r\nsight;” and her wishes were fulfilled.  She wept over her country and the\r\nspectators as well as over herself.  “Rouen, Rouen,” she cried, “is it\r\nhere that I must die?  Shalt thou be my last resting-place?  I fear\r\ngreatly thou wilt have to suffer for my death.”  It is said that the aged\r\nCardinal of Winchester and the Bishop of Beauvais himself could not\r\nstifle their emotion--and, peradventure, their tears.  The executioner\r\nset fire to the fagots.  When Joan perceived the flames rising, she urged\r\nher confessor, the Dominican brother, Martin Ladvenu, to go down, at the\r\nsame time asking him to keep holding the cross up high in front of her,\r\nthat she might never cease to see it.  The same monk, when questioned\r\nfour and twenty years later, at the rehabilitation trial, as to the last\r\nsentiments and the last words of Joan, said that to the very latest\r\nmoment she had affirmed that her voices were heavenly, that they had not\r\ndeluded her, and that the revelations she had received came from God.\r\nWhen she had ceased to live, two of her judges, John Alespie, canon of\r\nRouen, and Peter Maurice, doctor of theology, cried out, “Would that my\r\nsoul were where I believe the soul of that woman is!”  And Tressart,\r\nsecretary to King Henry VI., said sorrowfully, on returning from the\r\nplace of execution, “We are all lost; we have burned a saint.”\r\n\r\nA saint indeed in faith and in destiny.  Never was human creature more\r\nheroically confident in, and devoted to, inspiration coming from God, a\r\ncommission received from God.  Joan of Arc sought nothing of all that\r\nhappened to her and of all she did, nor exploit, nor power, nor glory.\r\n“It was not her condition,” as she used to say, to be a warrior, to get\r\nher king crowned, and to deliver her country from the foreigner.\r\nEverything came to her from on high, and she accepted everything without\r\nhesitation, without discussion, without calculation, as we should say in\r\nour times.  She believed in God, and obeyed Him.  God was not to her an\r\nidea, a hope, a flash of human imagination, or a problem of human\r\nscience; He was the Creator of the world, the Saviour of mankind through\r\nJesus Christ, the Being of beings, ever present, ever in action, sole\r\nlegitimate sovereign of man whom He has made intelligent and free, the\r\nreal and true God whom we are painfully searching for in our own day, and\r\nwhom we shall never find again until we cease pretending to do without\r\nHim and putting ourselves in His place.  Meanwhile one fact may be\r\nmentioned which does honor to our epoch and gives us hope for our future.\r\nFour centuries have rolled by since Joan of Arc, that modest and heroic\r\nservant of God, made a sacrifice of herself for France.  For four and\r\ntwenty years after her death, France and the king appeared to think no\r\nmore of her.  However, in 1455, remorse came upon Charles VII. and upon\r\nFrance.  Nearly all the provinces, all the towns, were freed from the\r\nforeigner, and shame was felt that nothing was said, nothing done, for\r\nthe young girl who had saved everything.  At Rouen, especially, where the\r\nsacrifice was completed, a cry for reparation arose.  It was timidly\r\ndemanded from the spiritual power which had sentenced and delivered over\r\nJoan as a heretic to the stake.  Pope Calixtus III. entertained the\r\nrequest preferred, not by the King of France, but in the name of Isabel\r\nRomee, Joan’s mother, and her whole family.  Regular proceedings were\r\ncommenced and followed up for the rehabilitation of the martyr; and, on\r\nthe 7th of July, 1456, a decree of the court assembled at Rouen quashed\r\nthe sentence of 1431, together with all its consequences, and ordered\r\n“a general procession and solemn sermon at St. Ouen Place and the Vieux-\r\nMarche,” where the said maid had been cruelly and horribly burned; besides\r\nthe planting of a cross of honor (crucis honestee) on the Vieux-Marche,\r\nthe judges reserving the official notice to be given of their decision\r\n“throughout the cities and notable places of the realm.”  The city of\r\nOrleans responded to this appeal by raising on the bridge over the Loire\r\na group in bronze representing Joan of Arc on her knees before Our Lady\r\nbetween two angels.  This monument, which was broken during the religious\r\nwars of the sixteenth century and repaired shortly afterwards, was\r\nremoved in the eighteenth century, and, Joan of Arc then received a fresh\r\ninsult; the poetry of a cynic was devoted to the task of diverting a\r\nlicentious public at the expense of the saint whom, three centuries\r\nbefore, fanatical hatred had brought to the stake.  In 1792 the council\r\nof the commune of Orleans, “considering that the monument in bronze did\r\nnot represent the heroine’s services, and did not by any sign call to\r\nmind the struggle against the English,” ordered it to be melted down and\r\ncast into cannons, of which “one should bear the name of Joan of Arc.”\r\n It is in our time that the city of Orleans and its distinguished bishop,\r\nMgr. Dupanloup, have at last paid Joan homage worthy of her, not only by\r\nerecting to her a new statue, but by recalling her again to the memory of\r\nFrance with her true features, and in her grand character.  Neither\r\nFrench nor any other history offers a like example of a modest little\r\nsoul, with a faith so pure and efficacious, resting on divine inspiration\r\nand patriotic hope.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial of Joan of Arc the war between France and England,\r\nwithout being discontinued, had been somewhat slack: the curiosity and\r\nthe passions of men were concentrated upon the scenes at Rouen.  After\r\nthe execution of Joan the war resumed its course, though without any\r\ngreat events.  By way of a step towards solution, the Duke of Bedford, in\r\nNovember, 1431, escorted to Paris King Henry VI., scarcely ten years old,\r\nand had him crowned at Notre-Dame.  The ceremony was distinguished for\r\npomp, but not for warmth.  The Duke of Burgundy was not present; it was\r\nan Englishman, the Cardinal-bishop of Winchester, who anointed the young\r\nEnglander King of France; the Bishop of Paris complained of it as a\r\nviolation of his rights; the parliament, the university, and the\r\nmunicipal body had not even seats reserved at the royal banquet; Paris\r\nwas melancholy, and day by day more deserted by the native inhabitants;\r\ngrass was growing in the court-yards of the great mansions; the students\r\nwere leaving the great school of Paris, to which the Duke of Bedford at\r\nCaen, and Charles VII. himself at Poitiers, were attempting to raise up\r\nrivals; and silence reigned in the Latin quarter.  The child-king was\r\nconsidered unintelligent, and ungraceful, and ungracious.  When, on the\r\nday after Christmas, he started on his way back to Rouen, and from Rouen\r\nto England, he did not confer on Paris “any of the boons expected, either\r\nby releasing prisoners or by putting an end to black-mails, gabels, and\r\nwicked imposts.”  The burgesses were astonished, and grumbled; and the\r\nold queen, Isabel of Bavaria, who was still living at the hostel of St.\r\nPaul, wept, it is said, for vexation, at seeing from one of her windows\r\nher grandson’s royal procession go by.\r\n\r\nThough war was going on all the while, attempts were made to negotiate;\r\nand in March, 1433, a conference was opened at Seineport, near Corbeil.\r\nEverybody in France desired peace.  Philip the Good himself began to feel\r\nthe necessity of it.  Burgundy was almost as discontented and troubled as\r\nIle-de-France.  There was grumbling at Dijon as there was conspiracy at\r\nParis.  The English gave fresh cause for national irritation.  They\r\nshowed an inclination to canton themselves in Normandy, and abandon the\r\nother French provinces to the hazards and sufferings of a desultory war.\r\nAnne of Burgundy, the Duke of Bedford’s wife and Philip the Good’s\r\nsister, died.  The English duke speedily married again without even\r\ngiving any notice to the French prince.  Every family tie between the two\r\npersons was broken; and the negotiations as well as the war remained\r\nwithout result.\r\n\r\nAn incident at court caused a change in the situation, and gave the\r\ngovernment of Charles a different character.  His favorite, George de la\r\nTremoille, had become almost as unpopular amongst the royal family as in\r\nthe country in general.  He could not manage a war, and he frustrated\r\nattempts at peace.  The Queen of Sicily, Yolande d’Aragon, her daughter,\r\nMary d’Anjou, Queen of France, and her son, Louis, Count of Maine, who\r\nall three desired peace, set themselves to work to overthrow the\r\nfavorite.  In June, 1433, four young lords, one of whom, Sire de Beuil,\r\nwas La Tremoille’s own nephew, introduced themselves unexpectedly into\r\nhis room at the castle of Coudray, near Chinon, where Charles VII. was.\r\nLa Tremoille showed an intention of resisting, and received a\r\nsword-thrust.  He was made to resign all his offices, and was sent under\r\nstrict guard to the castle of Alontresor, the property of his nephew,\r\nSire de Beuil.  The conspirators had concerted measures with La\r\nTremoille’s rival, the constable De Richemont, Arthur of Brittany, a man\r\ndistinguished in war, who had lately gone to help Joan of Arc, and who\r\nwas known to be a friend of peace at the same time that he was firmly\r\ndevoted to the national cause.  He was called away from his castle of\r\nParthenay, and set at the head of the government as well as of the army.\r\nCharles VII. at first showed anger at his favorite’s downfall.  He asked\r\nif Richemont was present, and was told no: where-upon he seemed to grow\r\ncalmer.  Before long he did more; he became resigned, and, continuing all\r\nthe while to give La Tremoille occasional proofs of his former favor, he\r\nfully accepted De Richemont’s influence and the new direction which the\r\nconstable imposed upon his government.\r\n\r\nWar was continued nearly everywhere, with alternations of success and\r\nreverse which deprived none of the parties of hope without giving victory\r\nto any.  Peace, however, was more and more the general desire.  Scarcely\r\nhad one attempt at pacification failed when another was begun.  The\r\nconstable De Richemont’s return to power led to fresh overtures.  He was\r\na states-man as well as a warrior; and his inclinations were known at\r\nDijon and London, as well as at Chinon.  The advisers of King Henry VI.\r\nproposed to open a conference, on the 15th of October, 1433, at Calais.\r\nThey had, they said, a prisoner in England, confined there ever since the\r\nbattle of Agincourt, Duke Charles of Orleans, who was sincerely desirous\r\nof peace, in spite of his family enmity towards the Duke of Burgundy.  He\r\nwas considered a very proper person to promote the negotiations, although\r\nhe sought in poetry, which was destined to bring lustre to his name, a\r\nrefuge from politics which made his life a burden.  He, one day meeting\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy’s two ambassadors at the Earl of Suffolk’s, Henry\r\nVI.’s prime minister, went up to them, affectionately took their hands,\r\nand, when they inquired after his health, said, “My body is well, my soul\r\nis sick; I am dying with vexation at passing my best days a prisoner,\r\nwithout any one to think of me.”  The ambassadors said that people would\r\nbe indebted to him for the benefit of peace, for he was known to be\r\nlaboring for it.  “My Lord of Suffolk,” said he, “can tell you that I\r\nnever cease to urge it upon the king and his council; but I am as useless\r\nhere as the sword never drawn from the scabbard.  I must see my relatives\r\nand friends in France; they will not treat, surely, without having\r\nconsulted with me.  If peace depended upon me, though I were doomed to\r\ndie seven days after swearing it, that would cause me no regret.\r\nhowever, what matters it what I say?  I am not master in anything at all;\r\nnext to the two kings, it is the Duke of Burgundy and the Duke of\r\nBrittany who have most power.  Will you not come and call upon me?”  he\r\nadded, pressing the hand of one of the ambassadors.  “They will see you\r\nbefore they go,” said the Earl of Suffolk, in a tone which made it plain\r\nthat no private conversation would be permitted between them.  And,\r\nindeed, the Earl of Suffolk’s barber went alone to wait upon the\r\nambassadors in order to tell them that, if the Duke of Burgundy desired\r\nit, the Duke of Orleans would write to him.  “I will undertake,” he\r\nadded, “to bring you his letter.”  There was evident mistrust; and it was\r\nexplained to the Burgundian ambassadors by the Earl of Warwick’s remark,\r\n“Your duke never once came to see our king during his stay in France.\r\nThe Duke of Bedford used similar language to them.  Why,” said he, “does\r\nmy brother the Duke of Burgundy give way to evil imaginings against me?\r\nThere is not a prince in the world, after my king, whom I esteem so much.\r\nThe ill-will which seems to exist between us spoils the king’s affairs\r\nand his own too.  But tell him that I am not the less disposed to serve\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nIn March, 1435, the Duke of Burgundy went to Paris, taking with him his\r\nthird wife, Isabel of Portugal, and a magnificent following.  There were\r\nseen, moreover, in his train, a hundred wagons laden with artillery,\r\narmor, salted provisions, cheeses, and wines of Burgundy.  There was once\r\nmore joy in Paris, and the duke received the most affectionate welcome.\r\nThe university was represented before him, and made him a great speech on\r\nthe necessity of peace.  Two days afterwards a deputation from the city\r\ndames of Paris waited upon the Duchess of Burgundy, and implored her to\r\nuse her influence for the re-establishment of peace.  She answered, “My\r\ngood friends, it is the thing I desire most of all in the world; I pray\r\nfor it night and day to the Lord our God, for I believe that we all have\r\ngreat need of it, and I know for certain that my lord and husband has the\r\ngreatest willingness to give up to that purpose his person and his\r\nsubstance.”  At the bottom of his soul Duke Philip’s decision was already\r\ntaken.  He had but lately discussed the condition of France with the\r\nconstable, De Richemont, and Duke Charles of Bourbon, his brother-in-law,\r\nwhom he had summoned to Nevers with that design.  Being convinced of the\r\nnecessity for peace, he spoke of it to the King of England’s advisers\r\nwhom he found in Paris, and who dared not show absolute opposition to it.\r\nIt was agreed that in the month of July a general, and, more properly\r\nspeaking, a European conference should meet at Arras, that the legates of\r\nPope Eugenius IV. should be invited to it, and that consultation should\r\nbe held thereat as to the means of putting an end to the sufferings of\r\nthe two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, accordingly, whilst the war was being prosecuted\r\nwith redoubled ardor on both sides at the very gates of Paris, there\r\narrived at Arras the pope’s legates and the ambassadors of the Emperor\r\nSigismund, of the Kings of Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Naples, Sicily,\r\nCyprus, Poland, and Denmark, and of the Dukes of Brittany and Milan.  The\r\nuniversity of Paris and many of the good towns of France, Flanders, and\r\neven Holland, had sent their deputies thither.  Many bishops were there\r\nin person.  The Bishop of Liege came thither with a magnificent train,\r\nmounted, says the chroniclers, on two hundred white horses.  The Duke of\r\nBurgundy made his entrance on the 30th of July, escorted by three hundred\r\narchers wearing his livery.  All the lords who happened to be in the city\r\nwent to meet him at a league’s distance, except the cardinal-legates of\r\nthe pope, who confined themselves to sending their people.  Two days\r\nafterwards arrived the ambassadors of the King of France, having at their\r\nhead the Duke of Bourbon and the constable De Richemont, together with\r\nseveral of the greatest French lords, and a retinue of four or five\r\nhundred persons.  Duke Philip, forewarned of their coming, issued from\r\nthe city with all the princes and lords who happened to be there.  The\r\nEnglish alone refused to accompany him, wondering at his showing such\r\ngreat honor to the ambassadors of their common enemy.  Philip went\r\nforward a mile to meet his two brothers-in-law, the Duke of Bourbon and\r\nthe Count de Richemont, embraced them affectionately, and turned back\r\nwith them into Arras, amidst the joy and acclamations of the populace.\r\nLast of all arrived the Duchess of Burgundy, magnificently dressed, and\r\nbringing with her her young son, the Count of Charolais, who was\r\nhereafter to be Charles the Rash.  The Duke of Bourbon, the constable De\r\nRichemont, and all the lords were on horseback around her litter; but the\r\nEnglish, who had gone, like the others, to meet her, were unwilling, on\r\nturning back to Arras, to form a part of her retinue with the French.\r\n\r\nGrand as was the sight, it was not superior in grandeur to the event on\r\nthe eve of accomplishment.  The question was whether France should remain\r\na great nation, in full possession of itself and of its independence\r\nunder a French king, or whether the King of England should, in London and\r\nwith the title of King of France, have France in his possession and under\r\nhis government.  Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was called upon to\r\nsolve this problem of the future, that is to say, to decide upon the fate\r\nof his lineage and his country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Philip the Good of Burgundy----144]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the conference was opened, and no matter what attempts were\r\nmade to veil or adjourn the question, it was put nakedly.  The English,\r\ninstead of peace, began by proposing a long truce, and the marriage of\r\nHenry VI. with a daughter of King Charles.  The French ambassadors\r\nrefused, absolutely, to negotiate on this basis; they desired a\r\ndefinitive peace; and their conditions were, that the King and people of\r\nEngland making an end of this situation, so full of clanger for the whole\r\nroyal house, and of suffering for the people.  Nevertheless, the duke\r\nshowed strong scruples.  The treaties he had sworn to, the promises he\r\nhad made, threw him into a constant fever of anxiety; he would not have\r\nany one able to say that he had in any respect forfeited his honor.  He\r\nasked for three consultations, one with the Italian doctors connected\r\nwith the pope’s legates, another with English doctors, and another with\r\nFrench doctors.  He was granted all three, though they were more\r\ncalculated to furnish him with arguments, each on their own side, than\r\nto dissipate his doubts, if he had any real ones.  The legates ended by\r\nsolemnly saying to him, “We do conjure you, by the bowels of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, and by the authority of our holy father, the pope, of the\r\nholy council assembled at Bale, and of the universal Church, to renounce\r\nthat spirit of vengeance whereby you are moved against King Charles in\r\nmemory of the late Duke John, your father; nothing can render you more\r\npleasing in the eyes of God, or further augment your fame in this world.”\r\n For three days Duke Philip remained still undecided; but he heard that\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, regent of France on behalf of the English, who was\r\nhis brother-in-law, had just died at Rouen, on the 14th of September.  He\r\nwas, besides the late King of England, Henry V., the only English-man who\r\nhad received promises from the duke, and who lived in intimacy with him.\r\nTen days afterwards, on the 21th of September, the queen, Isabel of\r\nBavaria, also died at Paris; and thus another of the principal causes of\r\nshame to the French kingship, and misfortune to France, disappeared from\r\nthe stage of the world.  Duke Philip felt himself more free and more at\r\nrest in his mind, if not rightfully, at any rate so far as political and\r\nworldly expedience was concerned.  He declared his readiness to accept\r\nthe proposals which had been communicated to him by the ambassadors of\r\nCharles VII.; and on the 21st of September, 1435, peace was signed at\r\nArras between France and Burgundy, without any care for what England\r\nmight say or do.\r\n\r\nThere was great and general joy in France.  It was peace, and national\r\nreconciliation as well; Dauphinizers and Burgundians embraced in the\r\nstreets; the Burgundians were delighted at being able to call themselves\r\nFrenchmen.  Charles VII. convoked the states-general at Tours, to\r\nconsecrate this alliance.  On his knees, upon the bare stone, before the\r\nArchbishop of Crete, who had just celebrated mass, the king laid his\r\nhands upon the Gospels, and swore the peace, saying that “It was his duty\r\nto imitate the King of kings, our divine Saviour, who had brought peace\r\namongst men.”  At the chancellor’s order, the princes and great lords,\r\none after the other, took the oath; the nobles and the people of the\r\nthird estate swore the peace all together, with cries of “Long live the\r\nking!  Long live the Duke of Burgundy!”  “With this hand,” said Sire de\r\nLannoy, “I have thrice sworn peace during this war; but I call God to\r\nwitness that, for my part, this time it shall be kept, and that never\r\nwill I break it (the peace).”  Charles VII., in his emotion, seized the\r\nhands of Duke Philip’s ambassadors, saying, “For a long while I have\r\nlanguished for this happy day; we must thank God for it.”  And the Te\r\nDeum was intoned with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPeace was really made amongst Frenchmen; and, in spite of many internal\r\ndifficulties and quarrels, it was not broken as long as Charles VII. and\r\nDuke Philip the Good were living.  But the war with the English went on\r\nincessantly.  They still possessed several of the finest provinces of\r\nFrance; and the treaty of Arras, which had weakened them very much on the\r\nContinent, had likewise made them very angry.  For twenty-six years, from\r\n1435 to 1461, hostilities continued between the two kingdoms, at one time\r\nactively and at another slackly, with occasional suspension by truce, but\r\nwithout any formal termination.  There is no use in recounting the\r\ndetails of their monotonous and barren history.  Governments and people\r\noften persist in maintaining their quarrels and inflicting mutual\r\ninjuries by the instrumentality of events, acts, and actors that deserve\r\nnothing but oblivion.  There is no intention here of dwelling upon any\r\nevents or persons save such as have, for good or for evil, to its glory\r\nor its sorrow, exercised a considerable influence upon the condition and\r\nfortune of France.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Arras brought back to the service of France and her king the\r\nconstable De Richemont, Arthur of Brittany, whom the jealousy of George\r\nde la Tremoille and the distrustful indolence of Charles VII. had so long\r\nkept out of it.  By a somewhat rare privilege, he was in reality, there\r\nis reason to suppose, superior to the name he has left behind him in\r\nhistory; and it is only justice to reproduce here the portrait given of\r\nhim by one of his contemporaries who observed him closely and knew him\r\nwell.  “Never a man of his time,” says William Gruet, “loved justice more\r\nthan he, or took more pains to do it according to his ability.  Never was\r\nprince more humble, more charitable, more compassionate, more liberal,\r\nless avaricious, or more open-handed in a good fashion and without\r\nprodigality.  He was a proper man, chaste and brave as prince can be; and\r\nthere was none of his time of better conduct than lie in conducting a\r\ngreat battle, or a great siege, and all sorts of approaches in all sorts\r\nof ways.  Every day, once at least in the four and twenty hours, his\r\nconversation was of war, and he took more pleasure in it than in aught\r\nelse.  Above all things he loved men of valor and good renown, and he\r\nmore than any other loved and supported the people, and freely did good\r\nto poor mendicants and others of God’s poor.”\r\n\r\nNearly all the deeds of Richemont, from the time that he became powerful\r\nagain, confirm the truth of this portrait.  His first thought and his\r\nfirst labor were to restore Paris to France and to the king.  The unhappy\r\ncity in subjection to the English was the very image of devastation and\r\nruin.  “The wolves prowled about it by night, and there were in it,” says\r\nan eye-witness, “twenty-four thousand houses empty.”  The Duke of\r\nBedford, in order to get rid of these public tokens of misery, attempted\r\nto supply the Parisians with bread and amusements (panem et circenses);\r\nbut their very diversions were ghastly and melancholy.  In 1425, there\r\nwas painted in the sepulchre of the Innocents a picture called the Dance\r\nof Death: Death, grinning with fleshless jaws, was represented taking by\r\nthe hand all estates of the population in their turn, and making them\r\ndance.  In the Hotel Armagnac, confiscated, as so many others were, from\r\nits owner, a show was exhibited to amuse the people.  “Four blind men,\r\narmed with staves, were shut up with a pig in a little paddock.  They had\r\nto see whether they could kill the said pig, and when they thought they\r\nwere belaboring it most they were belaboring one another.”  The constable\r\nresolved to put a stop to this deplorable state of things in the capital\r\nof France.  In April, 1433, when he had just ordered for himself\r\napartments at St. Denis, he heard that the English had just got in there\r\nand plundered the church.  He at once gave orders to march.  The\r\nBurgundians, who made up nearly all his troop, demanded their pay, and\r\nwould not mount.  Richemont gave them his bond; and the march was begun\r\nto St.  Denis.  “You know the country?” said the constable to Marshal\r\nIsle-Adam.  “Yes, my lord,” answered the other; “and by my faith, in the\r\nposition held by the English, you would do nothing to harm or annoy them,\r\nthough you had ten thousand fighting men.”  “Ah! but we will,” replied\r\nRichemont; “God will help us.  Keep pressing forward to support the\r\nskirmishers.”  And he occupied St. Denis, and drove out the English.  The\r\npopulation of Paris, being informed of this success, were greatly moved\r\nand encouraged.  One brave burgess of Paris, Michel Laillier, master of\r\nthe exchequer, notified to the constable, it is said, that they were\r\nready and quite able to open one of the gates to him, provided that an\r\nengagement were entered into in the king’s name for a general amnesty and\r\nthe prevention of all disorder.  The constable, on the king’s behalf,\r\nentered into the required engagement, and presented himself the next day,\r\nthe 13th of April, with a picked force before the St. Michel gate.  The\r\nenterprise was discovered.  A man posted on the wall made signs to them\r\nwith his hat, crying out, “Go to the other gate; there’s no opening this;\r\nwork is going on for you in the Market-quarter.”  The picked force\r\nfollowed the course of the ramparts up to the St. Jacques gate.  “Who\r\ngoes there?” demanded some burghers who had the guard of it.  “Some of\r\nthe constable’s people.”  He himself came up on his big charger, with\r\nsatisfaction and courtesy in his mien.  Some little time was required for\r\nopening the gate; a long ladder was let down; and Marshal Isle-Adam was\r\nthe first to mount, and planted on the wall the standard of France.  The\r\nfastenings of the drawbridge were burst, and when it was let down, the\r\nconstable made his entry on horseback, riding calmly down St. Jacques\r\nStreet, in the midst of a joyous and comforted crowd.  “My good friends,”\r\n he said to them, “the good King Charles, and I on his behalf, do thank\r\nyou a hundred thousand times for yielding up to him so quietly the chief\r\ncity of his kingdom.  If there be amongst you any, of whatsoever\r\ncondition he may be, who hath offended against my lord ‘the king, all is\r\nforgiven, in the case both of the absent and the present.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Constable Made his Entry on Horseback----150]\r\n\r\nThen he caused it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet throughout the\r\nstreets that none of his people should be so bold, on pain of hanging, as\r\nto take up quarters in the house of any burgher against his will, or to\r\nuse any reproach whatever, or do the least displeasure to any.  At sight\r\nof the public joy, the English had retired to the Bastille, where the\r\nconstable was disposed to besiege them.  “My lord,” said the burghers to\r\nhim, “they will surrender; do not reject their offer; it is so far a fine\r\nthing enough to have thus recovered Paris; often, on the contrary, many\r\nconstables and many marshals have been driven out of it.  Take\r\ncontentedly what God hath granted you.”  The burghers’ prediction was not\r\nunverified.  The English sallied out of the Bastille by the gate which\r\nopened on the fields, and went and took boat in the rear of the Louvre.\r\nNext day abundance of provisions arrived in Paris; and the gates were\r\nopened to the country folks.  The populace freely manifested their joy at\r\nbeing rid of the English.  “It was plain to see,” was the saving, “that\r\nthey were not in France to remain; not one of them had been seen to sow a\r\nfield with corn or build a house; they destroyed their quarters without a\r\nthought of repairing them; they had not restored, peradventure, a single\r\nfireplace.  There was only their regent, the Duke of Bedford, who was\r\nfond of building and making the poor people work; he would have liked\r\npeace; but the nature of those English is to be always at war with their\r\nneighbors, and accordingly they all made a bad end; thank God there have\r\nalready died in France more than seventy thousand of them.”\r\n\r\nUp to the taking of Paris by the constable the Duke of Burgundy had kept\r\nhimself in reserve, and had maintained a tacit neutrality towards\r\nEngland; he had merely been making, without noisy demonstration,\r\npreparations for an enterprise in which he, as Count of Flanders, was\r\nvery much interested.  The success of Richemont inspired him with a hope,\r\nand perhaps with a jealous desire, of showing his power and his\r\npatriotism as a Frenchman by making war, in his turn, upon the English,\r\nfrom whom he had by the treaty of Arras effected only a pacific\r\nseparation.  In June, 1436, he went and besieged Calais.  This was\r\nattacking England at one of the points she was bent upon defending most\r\nobstinately.  Philip had reckoned on the energetic cooperation of the\r\ncities of Flanders, and at the first blush the Flemings did display a\r\nstrong inclination to support him in his enterprise.  “When the\r\nEnglish,” they said, “know that my lords of Ghent are on the way to\r\nattack them with all their might they will not await us; they will leave\r\nthe city and flee away to England.”  Neither the Flemings nor Philip had\r\ncorrectly estimated the importance which was attached in London to the\r\npossession of Calais.  When the Duke of Gloucester, lord-protector of\r\nEngland, found this possession threatened, he sent a herald to defy the\r\nDuke of Burgundy and declare to him that, if he did not wait for battle\r\nbeneath the walls of Calais, Humphrey of Gloucester would go after him\r\neven into his own dominions.  “Tell your lord that he will not need to\r\ntake so much trouble, and that he will find me here,” answered Philip\r\nproudly.  His pride was over-confident.  Whether it were only a people’s\r\nfickleness or intelligent appreciation of their own commercial interests\r\nin their relations with England, the Flemings grew speedily disgusted\r\nwith the siege of Calais, complained of the tardiness in arrival of the\r\nfleet which Philip had despatched thither to close the port against\r\nEnglish vessels, and, after having suffered several reverses by sorties\r\nof the English garrison, they ended by retiring with such precipitation\r\nthat they abandoned part of their supplies and artillery.  Philip,\r\naccording to the expression of M. Henri Martin, was reduced to covering\r\ntheir retreat with his cavalry; and then he went away sorrowfully to\r\nLille, to advise about the means of defending his Flemish lordships\r\nexposed to the reprisals of the English.\r\n\r\nThus the fortune of Burgundy was tottering whilst that of France was\r\nrecovering itself.  The constable’s easy occupation of Paris led the\r\nmajority of the small places in the neighborhood, St. Denis, Chevreuse,\r\nMarcoussis, and Montlhery to decide either upon spontaneous surrender or\r\nallowing themselves to be taken after no great resistance.  Charles VII.,\r\non his way through France to Lyon, in Dauphiny, Languedoc, Auvergne, and\r\nalong the Loire, recovered several other towns, for instance, Chateau-\r\nLandon, Nemours, and Charny.  He laid siege in person to Montereau, an\r\nimportant military post with which a recent and sinister reminiscence was\r\nconnected.  A great change now made itself apparent in the king’s\r\nbehavior and disposition.  He showed activity and vigilance, and was\r\nready to expose himself without any care for fatigue or danger.  On the\r\nday of the assault (10th of October, 1437) he went down into the\r\ntrenches, remained there in water up to his waist, mounted the scaling-\r\nladder sword in hand, and was one of the first assailants who penetrated\r\nover the top of the walls right into the place.  After the surrender of\r\nthe castle as well as the town of Montereau, he marched on Paris, and\r\nmade his solemn re-entry there on the 12th of November, 1437, for the\r\nfirst time since in 1418 Tanneguy-Duchatel had carried him away, whilst\r\nstill a child, wrapped in his bed-clothes.  Charles was received and\r\nentertained as became a recovered and a victorious king; but he passed\r\nonly three weeks there, and went away once more, on the 3d of December,\r\nto go and resume at Orleans first, and then at Bourges, the serious cares\r\nof government.  It is said to have been at this royal entry into Paris\r\nthat Agnes Sorel or Soreau, who was soon to have the name of Queen of\r\nBeauty, and to assume in French history an almost glorious though\r\nillegitimate position, appeared with brilliancy in the train of the\r\nqueen, Mary of Anjou, to whom the king had appointed her a maid of honor.\r\nIt is a question whether she did not even then exercise over Charles VII.\r\nthat influence, serviceable alike to the honor of the king and of France,\r\nwhich was to inspire Francis I., a century later, with this gallant\r\nquatrain:\r\n\r\n         “If to win back poor captive France be aught,\r\n             More honor, gentle Agnes, is thy weed,\r\n          Than ere was due to deeds of virtue wrought\r\n             By cloistered nun or pious hermit-breed.”\r\n\r\nIt is worth while perhaps to remark that in 1437 Agnes Sorel was already\r\ntwenty-seven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Agnes Sorel----175]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best informed, most impartial, and most sensible historians of\r\nthat epoch, James Duclercq, merely says on this subject, King Charles,\r\nbefore he had peace with Duke Philip of Burgundy, led a right holy life\r\nand said his canonical hours.  But after peace was made with the duke,\r\nthough the king continued to serve God, he joined himself unto a young\r\nwoman who was afterwards called Fair Agnes.\r\n\r\nNothing is gained by ignoring good even when it is found in company with\r\nevil, and there is no intention here of disputing the share of influence\r\nexercised by Agnes Sorel upon Charles VII.’s regeneration in politics and\r\nwar after the treaty of Arras.  Nevertheless, in spite of the king’s\r\nsuccesses at Montereau and during his passage through Central and\r\nNorthern France, the condition of the country was still so bad in 1440,\r\nthe disorder was so great, and the king so powerless to apply a remedy,\r\nthat Richemont, disconsolate, was tempted to rid and disburden himself\r\nfrom the government of France and between the rivers [Seine and Loire, no\r\ndoubt] and to go or send to the king for that purpose.  But one day the\r\nprior of the Carthusians at Paris called on the constable and found him\r\nin his private chapel.  “What need you, fair father?” asked Richemont.\r\nThe prior answered that he wished to speak with my lord the constable.\r\nRichemont replied that it was he himself.  “Pardon me, my lord,” said the\r\nprior, “I did not know you; I wish to speak to you, if you please.”\r\n “Gladly,” said Richemont.  “Well, my lord, you yesterday held counsel and\r\nconsidered about disburdening yourself from the government and office you\r\nhold hereabouts.”  “How know you that?  Who told you?”  “My lord, I do\r\nnot know it through any person of your council, and do not put yourself\r\nout to learn who told me, for it was one of my brethren.  My lord, do not\r\ndo this thing; and be not troubled, for God will help you.”  “Ah! fair\r\nfather, how can that be?  The king has no mind to aid me or grant me men\r\nor money; and the men-at-arms hate me because I have justice done on\r\nthem, and they have no mind to obey me.”  “My lord, they will do what you\r\ndesire; and the king will give you orders to go and lay siege to Meaux,\r\nand will send you men and money.”  “Ah! fair father, Meaux is so strong!\r\nHow can it be done?  The King of England was there for nine months before\r\nit.”  “My lord, be not you troubled; you will not be there so long; keep\r\nhaving good hope in God and He will help you.  Be ever humble and grow\r\nnot proud; you will take Meaux ere long; your men will grow proud; they\r\nwill then have somewhat to suffer; but you will come out of it to your\r\nhonor.”\r\n\r\nThe good prior was right.  Meaux was taken; and when the constable went\r\nto tell the news at Paris the king made him “great cheer.”  There was a\r\ncontinuance of war to the north of the Loire; and amidst many\r\nalternations of successes and reverses the national cause made great way\r\nthere.  Charles resolved, in 1442, to undertake an expedition to the\r\nsouth of the Loire, in Aquitaine, where the English were still dominant;\r\nand he was successful.  He took from the English Tartas, Saint-Sever,\r\nMarmande, La Reole, Blaye, and Bourg-sur-Mer.  Their ally, Count John\r\nd’Armagnac, submitted to the King of France.  These successes cost\r\nCharles VII. the brave La Hire, who died at Montauban of his wounds.\r\nOn returning to Normandy, where he had left Dunois, Charles, in 1443,\r\nconducted a prosperous campaign there.  The English leaders were getting\r\nweary of a war without any definite issue; and they had proposals made to\r\nCharles for a truce, accompanied with a demand on the part of their young\r\nking, Henry VI., for the hand of a French princess, Margaret of Anjou,\r\ndaughter of King Rena, who wore the three crowns of Naples, Sicily, and\r\nJerusalem, without possessing any one of the kingdoms.  The truce and the\r\nmarriage were concluded at Tours, in 1444.  Neither of the arrangements\r\nwas popular in England; the English people, who had only a far-off touch\r\nof suffering from the war, considered that their government made too many\r\nconcessions to France.  In France, too, there was some murmuring; the\r\nking, it was said, did not press his advantages with sufficient vigor;\r\neverybody was in a hurry to see all Aquitaine reconquered.  “But a joy\r\nthat was boundless and impossible to describe,” says Thomas Bazin, the\r\nmost intelligent of the contemporary historians, “spread abroad through\r\nthe whole population of the Gauls.  Having been a prey for so long to\r\nincessant terrors, and shut up within the walls of their towns like\r\nconvicts in a prison, they rejoiced like people restored to freedom after\r\na long and bitter slavery.  Companies of both sexes were seen going forth\r\ninto the country and visiting temples or oratories dedicated to the\r\nsaints, to pay the vows which they had made in their distress.  One fact\r\nespecially was admirable and the work of God Himself: before the truce so\r\nviolent had been the hatred between the two sides, both men-at-arms and\r\npeople, that none, whether soldier or burgher, could without risk to life\r\ngo out and pass from one place to another unless under the protection of\r\na safe-conduct.  But, so soon as the truce was proclaimed, every one went\r\nand came at pleasure, in full liberty and security, whether in the same\r\ndistrict or in districts under divided rule; and even those who, before\r\nthe proclamation of the truce, seemed to take no pleasure in anything but\r\na savage outpouring of human blood, now took delight in the sweets of\r\npeace, and passed the days in holiday-making and dancing with enemies who\r\nbut lately had been as bloodthirsty as themselves.”\r\n\r\nBut for all their rejoicing at the peace, the French, king, lords, and\r\ncommons, had war still in their hearts; national feelings were waking up\r\nafresh; the successes of late years had revived their hopes; and the\r\ncivil dissensions which were at that time disturbing England let\r\nfavorable chances peep out.  Charles VII. and his advisers employed the\r\nleisure afforded by the truce in preparing for a renewal of the struggle.\r\nThey were the first to begin it again; and from 1449 to 1451 it was\r\npursued by the French king and nation with ever-increasing ardor, and\r\nwith obstinate courage by the veteran English warriors astounded at no\r\nlonger being victorious.  Normandy and Aquitaine, which was beginning to\r\nbe called Guyenne only, were throughout this period the constant and the\r\nchief theatre of war.  Amongst the greatest number of fights and\r\nincidents which distinguished the three campaigns in those two provinces,\r\nthe recapture of Rouen by Dunois in October, 1449, the battle of\r\nFormigny, won near Bayeux on the 15th of April, 1450, by the constable De\r\nRichemont, and the twofold capitulation of Bordeaux, first on the 28th of\r\nJune, 1451, and next on the 9th of October, 1453, in order to submit to\r\nCharles VII., are the only events to which a place in history is due, for\r\nthose were the days on which the question was solved touching the\r\nindependence of the nation and the kingship in France.  The Duke of\r\nSomerset and Lord Talbot were commanding in Rouen when Dunois presented\r\nhimself beneath its walls, in hopes that the inhabitants would open the\r\ngates to him.  Some burgesses, indeed, had him apprised of a certain\r\npoint in the walls at which they might be able to favor the entry of the\r\nFrench.  Dunois, at the same time making a feint of attacking in another\r\nquarter, arrived at the spot indicated with four thousand men.  The\r\narchers drew up before the wall; the men-at-arms dismounted; the\r\nburgesses gave the signal, and the planting of scaling-ladders began; but\r\nwhen hardly as many as fifty or sixty men had reached the top of the wall\r\nthe banner and troops of Talbot were seen advancing.  He had been warned\r\nin time and had taken his measures.  The assailants were repulsed; and\r\nCharles VII., who was just arriving at the camp, seeing the abortiveness\r\nof the attempt, went back to Pont-de-l’Arehe.  But the English had no\r\nlong joy of their success.  They were too weak to make any effectual\r\nresistance, and they had no hope of any aid from England.  Their leaders\r\nauthorized the burgesses to demand of the king a safe-conduct in order to\r\ntreat.  The conditions offered by Charles were agreeable to the\r\nburgesses, but not to the English; and when the archbishop read them\r\nout in the hall of the mansion-house, Somerset and Talbot witnessed an\r\noutburst of joy which revealed to them all their peril.  Fagots and\r\nbenches at once began to rain down from the windows; the English shut\r\nthemselves up precipitately in the castle, in the gate-towers, and in the\r\ngreat tower of the bridge; and the burgesses armed themselves and took\r\npossession during the night of the streets and the walls.  Dunois, having\r\nreceived notice, arrived in force at the Martainville gate.  The\r\ninhabitants begged him to march into the city as many men as he pleased.\r\n“It shall be as you will,” said Dunois.  Three hundred men-at-arms and\r\narchers seemed sufficient.  Charles VII returned before Rouen; the\r\nEnglish asked leave to withdraw without loss of life or kit; and “on\r\ncondition,” said the king “that they take nothing on the march without\r\npaying.”  “We have not the wherewithal,” they answered; and the king gave\r\nthem a hundred francs.  Negotiations were recommenced.  The king required\r\nthat Harfleur and all the places in the district of Caux should be given\r\nup to him.  “Ah! as for Harfleur, that cannot be,” said the Duke of\r\nSomerset; “it is the first town which surrendered to our glorious king,\r\nHenry V., thirty-five years ago.”  There was further parley.  The French\r\nconsented to give up the demand for Harfleur; but they required that\r\nTalbot should remain as a hostage until the conditions were fulfilled.\r\nThe English protested.  At last, however, they yielded, and undertook to\r\npay fifty thousand golden crowns to settle all accounts which they owed\r\nto the tradesmen in the city, and to give up all places in the district\r\nof Caen except Harfleur.  The Duchess of Somerset and Lord Talbot\r\nremained as hostages; and on the 10th of November, 1449, Charles entered\r\nRouen in state, with the character of a victor who knew how to use\r\nvictory with moderation.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Formigny was at first very doubtful.  In order to get from\r\nValognes to Bayeux and Caen the English had to cross at the mouth of the\r\nVire great sands which were passable only at low tide.  A weak body of\r\nFrench under command of the Count de Clermont had orders to cut them off\r\nfrom this passage.  The English, however, succeeded in forcing it; but\r\njust as they were taking position, with the village of Formigny to cover\r\ntheir rear, the constable De Richemont was seen coming up with three\r\nthousand men in fine order.  The English were already strongly\r\nintrenched, when the battle began.  “Let us go and look close in their\r\nfaces, admiral,” said the constable to Sire de Coetivi.  “I doubt whether\r\nthey will leave their intrenchments,” replied the admiral.  “I vow to God\r\nthat with His grace they will not abide in them,” rejoined the\r\nconstable; and he gave orders for the most vigorous assault.  It lasted\r\nnearly three hours; the English were forced to fly at three points, and\r\nlost thirty-seven hundred men; several of their leaders were made\r\nprisoners; those who were left retired in good order; Bayeux, Avranches,\r\nCaen, Falaise, and Cherbourg fell one after the other into the hands of\r\nCharles VII.; and by the end of August, 1450, the whole of Normandy had\r\nbeen completely won back by France.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Guyenne, which was undertaken immediately after that of\r\nNormandy, was at the outset more easy and more speedy.  Amongst the lords\r\nof Southern France several hearty patriots, such as John of Blois, Count\r\nof Perigord, and Arnold Amanieu, Sire d’Albret, of their own accord began\r\nthe strife, and on the 1st of November, 1450, inflicted a somewhat severe\r\nreverse upon the English, near Blanquefort.  In the spring of the\r\nfollowing year Charles VII. authorized the Count of Armagnac to take the\r\nfield, and sent Dunois to assume the command-in-chief.  An army of twenty\r\nthousand men mustered under his orders; and, in the course of May, 1451,\r\nsome of the principal places of Guyenne, such as St. Emillon, Blaye,\r\nFronsac, Bourg-en-Mer, Libourne, and Dax were taken by assault or\r\ncapitulated.  Bordeaux and Bayonne held out for some weeks; but, on the\r\n12th of June, a treaty concluded between the Bordelese and Dunois secured\r\nto the three estates of the district the liberties and privileges which\r\nthey had enjoyed under English supremacy; and it was further stipulated\r\nthat, if by the 24th of June the city had not been succored by English\r\nforces, the estates of Guyenne should recognize the sovereignty of King\r\nCharles.  When the 24th of June came, a herald went up to one of the\r\ntowers of the castle and shouted, “Succor from the King of England for\r\nthem of Bordeaux!!”  None replied to this appeal; so Bordeaux\r\nsurrendered, and on the 29th of June Dunois took possession of it in the\r\nname of the King of France.  The siege of Bayonne, which was begun on the\r\n6th of August, came to an end on the 20th by means of a similar treaty.\r\nGuyenne was thus completely won.  But the English still had a\r\nconsiderable following there.  They had held it for three centuries;\r\nand they had always treated it well in respect of local liberties,\r\nagriculture, and commerce.  Charles VII., on recovering it, was less\r\nwise.  He determined to establish there forthwith the taxes, the laws,\r\nand the whole regimen of Northern France; and the Bordelese were as\r\nprompt in protesting against these measures as the king was in employing\r\nthem.  In August, 1452, a deputation from the three estates of the\r\nprovince waited upon Charles at Bourges, but did not obtain their\r\ndemands.  On their return to Bordeaux an insurrection was organized; and\r\nPeter de Montferrand, Sire de Lesparre, repaired to London and proposed\r\nto the English government to resume possession of Guyenne.  On the 22d of\r\nOctober, 1452, Talbot appeared before Bordeaux with a body of five\r\nthousand men; the inhabitants opened their gates to him; and he installed\r\nhimself there as lieutenant of the King of England, Henry VI.  Nearly all\r\nthe places in the neighborhood, with the exception of Bourg and Blaye,\r\nreturned beneath the sway of the English; considerable reenforcements\r\nwere sent to Talbot from England; and at the same time an English fleet\r\nthreatened the coast of Normandy.  But Charles VII. was no longer the\r\nblind and indolent king he had been in his youth.  Nor can the prompt and\r\neffectual energy he displayed in 1453 be any longer attributed to the\r\ninfluence of Agnes Sorel, for she died on the 9th of February, 1450.\r\nCharles left Richemont and Dunois to hold Normandy; and, in the early\r\ndays of spring, moved in person to the south of France with a strong army\r\nand the principal Gascon lords who two years previously had brought\r\nGuyenne back under his power.  On the 2d of June, 1453, he opened the\r\ncampaign at St. Jean-d’Angely.  Several places surrendered to him as soon\r\nas he appeared before their walls; and on the 13th of July he laid siege\r\nto Castillon, on the Dordogne, which had shortly before fallen into the\r\nhands of the English.  The Bordelese grew alarmed and urged Talbot to\r\noppose the advance of the French.  “We may very well let them come nearer\r\nyet,” said the old warrior, then eighty years of age; “rest assured that,\r\nif it please God, I will fulfil my promise when I see that the time and\r\nthe hour have come.”\r\n\r\nOn the night between the 16th and 17th of July, however, Talbot set out\r\nwith his troops to raise the siege of Castillon.  He marched all night\r\nand came suddenly in the early morning upon the French archers, quartered\r\nin an abbey, who formed the advanced guard of their army, which was\r\nstrongly intrenched before the place.  A panic set in amongst this small\r\nbody, and some of them took to flight.  “Ha! you would desert me then?”\r\n said Sire de Rouault, who was in command of them; “have I not promised\r\nyou to live and die with you?”  They thereupon rallied and managed to\r\njoin the camp.  Talbot, content for the time with this petty success,\r\nsent for a chaplain to come and say mass; and, whilst waiting for an\r\nopportunity to resume the fight, he permitted the tapping of some casks\r\nof wine which had been found in the abbey, and his men set themselves to\r\ndrinking.  A countryman of those parts came hurrying up, and said to\r\nTalbot, “My lord, the French are deserting their park and taking to\r\nflight; now or never is the hour for fulfilling your promise.”  Talbot\r\narose and left the mass, shouting, “Never may I hear mass again if I put\r\nnot to rout the French who are in yonder park.”  When he arrived in front\r\nof the Frenchmen’s intrenchment, “My lord,” said Sir Thomas Cunningham,\r\nan aged gentleman who had for a long time past been his standard-bearer,\r\n“they have made a false report to you; observe the depth of the ditch and\r\nthe faces of yonder men; they don’t look like retreating; my opinion is,\r\nthat for the present we should turn back; the country is for us, we have\r\nno lack of provisions, and with a little patience we shall starve out the\r\nFrench.”  Talbot flew into a passion, gave Sir Thomas a sword-cut across\r\nthe face, had his banner planted on the edge of the ditch, and began the\r\nattack.  The banner was torn down and Sir Thomas Cunningham killed.\r\n“Dismount!” shouted Talbot to his men-at-arms, English and Gascon.  The\r\nFrench camp was defended by a more than usually strong artillery; a body\r\nof Bretons, held in reserve, advanced to sustain the shock of the\r\nEnglish; and a shot from a culverin struck Talbot, who was already\r\nwounded in the face, shattered his thigh, and brought him to the ground.\r\nLord Lisle, his son, flew to him to raise him.  “Let me be,” said Talbot;\r\n“the day is the enemies’; it will be no shame for thee to fly, for this\r\nis thy first battle.”  But the son remained with his father, and was\r\nslain at his side.  The defeat of the English was complete.  Talbot’s\r\nbody, pierced with wounds, was left on the field of battle.  He was so\r\ndisfigured that, when the dead were removed, he was not recognized.\r\nNotice, however, was taken of an old man wearing a cuirass covered with\r\nred velvet; this, it was presumed, was he; and he was placed upon a\r\nshield and carried into the camp.  An English herald came with a request\r\nthat he might look for Lord’ Talbot’s body.  “Would you know him?” he was\r\nasked.  “Take me to see him,” joyfully answered the poor servant,\r\nthinking that his master was a prisoner and alive.  When he saw him, he\r\nhesitated to identify him; he knelt down, put his finger in the mouth of\r\nthe corpse, and recognized Talbot by the loss of a molar tooth.  Throwing\r\noff immediately his coat-of-arms with the colors and bearings of Talbot,\r\n“Ah! my lord and master,” he cried, “can this be verily you?  May God\r\nforgive your sins!  For forty years and more I have been your\r\nofficer-at-arms and worn your livery, and thus I give it back to you!”\r\n And he covered with his coat-of-arms the stark-stripped body of the\r\nold hero.\r\n\r\nThe English being beaten and Talbot dead, Castillon surrendered; and at\r\nunequal intervals Libourne, St. Emillon, Chateau-Neuf de Medoc,\r\nBlanquefort, St. Macaire, Cadillac, &c., followed the example.  At the\r\ncommencement of October, 1453, Bordeaux alone was still holding out.  The\r\npromoters of the insurrection which had been concerted with the English,\r\namongst others Sires de Duras and de Lesparre, protracted the resistance\r\nrather in their own self-defence than in response to the wishes of the\r\npopulation; the king’s artillery threatened the place by land, and by sea\r\na king’s fleet from Rochelle and the ports of Brittany blockaded the\r\nGironde.  “The majority of the king’s officers,” says the contemporary\r\nhistorian, Thomas Basin, “advised him to punish by at least the\r\ndestruction of their walls the Bordelese who had recalled the English to\r\ntheir city; but Charles, more merciful and more soft-hearted, refused.”\r\n He confined himself to withdrawing from Bordeaux her municipal\r\nprivileges, which, however, she soon partially recovered, and to imposing\r\nupon her a fine of a hundred thousand gold crowns, afterwards reduced to\r\nthirty thousand; he caused to be built at the expense of the city two\r\nfortresses, the Fort of the Ila and the Castle of Trompette, to keep in\r\ncheck so bold and fickle a population; and an amnesty was proclaimed for\r\nall but twenty specified persons, who were banished.  On these conditions\r\nthe capitulation was concluded and signed on the 17th of October; the\r\nEnglish re-embarked; and Charles, without entering Bordeaux, returned to\r\nTouraine.  The English had no longer any possession in France but Calais\r\nand Guines; the Hundred Years’ War was over.\r\n\r\nAnd to whom was the glory?\r\n\r\nCharles VII. himself decided the question.  When in 1455, twenty-four\r\nyears after the death of Joan of Are, he at Rome and at Rouen prosecuted\r\nher claims for restoration of character and did for her fame and her\r\nmemory all that was still possible, he was but relieving his conscience\r\nfrom a load of ingratitude and remorse which in general weighs but\r\nlightly upon men, and especially upon kings; and he was discharging\r\ntowards the Maid of Domremy the debt due by France and the French\r\nkingship when he thus proclaimed that to Joan above all they owed their\r\ndeliverance and their independence.  Before men and before God Charles\r\nwas justified in so thinking; the moral are not the sole, but they are\r\nthe most powerful forces which decide the fates of people; and Joan had\r\nroused the feelings of the soul, and given to the struggles between\r\nFrance and England its religious and national character.  At Rheims, when\r\nshe repaired thither for the king’s coronation, she said of her own\r\nbanner, “It has a right to the honor, for it has been at the pains.”\r\n She, first amongst all, had a right to the glory, for she had been the\r\nfirst to contribute to the success.\r\n\r\nNext to Joan of Arc, the constable De Richemont was the most effective\r\nand the most glorious amongst the liberators of France and of the king.\r\nHe was a strict and stern warrior, unscrupulous and pitiless towards his\r\nenemies, especially towards such as he despised, severe in regard to\r\nhimself, dignified in his manners, never guilty of swearing himself and\r\npunishing swearing as a breach of discipline amongst the troops placed\r\nunder his orders.  Like a true patriot and royalist, he had more at heart\r\nhis duty towards France and the king than he had his own personal\r\ninterests.  He was fond of war, and conducted it bravely and skilfully,\r\nwithout rashness, but without timidity: “Wherever the constable is,” said\r\nCharles VII., “there I am free from anxiety; he will do all that is\r\npossible!”  He set his title and office of constable of France above his\r\nrank as a great lord; and when, after the death of his brother, Duke\r\nPeter II., he himself became Duke of Brittany, he always had the\r\nconstable’s sword carried before him, saying, “I wish to honor in my old\r\nage a function which did me honor in my youth.”  His good services were\r\nnot confined to the wars of his time; he was one of the principal\r\nreformers of the military system in France by the substitution of regular\r\ntroops for feudal service.  He has not obtained, it is to be feared, in\r\nthe history of the fifteenth century, the place which properly belongs to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDunois, La Hire, Xaintrailles, and Marshals De Boussac and De La Fayette\r\nwere, under Charles VII., brilliant warriors and useful servants of the\r\nking and of Fiance; but, in spite of their knightly renown, it is\r\nquestionable if they can be reckoned, like the constable De Richemont,\r\namongst the liberators of national independence.  There are degrees of\r\nglory, and it is the duty of history not to distribute it too readily and\r\nas it were by handfuls.\r\n\r\nBesides all these warriors, we meet, under the sway of Charles VII., at\r\nfirst in a humble capacity and afterwards at his court, in his diplomatic\r\nservice and sometimes in his closest confidence, a man of quite a\r\ndifferent origin and quite another profession, but one who nevertheless\r\nacquired by peaceful toil great riches and great influence, both brought\r\nto a melancholy termination by a conviction and a consequent ruin from\r\nwhich at the approach of old age he was still striving to recover by\r\nmeans of fresh ventures.  Jacques Coeur was born at Bourges at the close\r\nof the fourteenth century.  His father was a furrier, already\r\nsufficiently well established and sufficiently rich to allow of his son’s\r\nmarrying, in 1418, the provost’s daughter of his own city.  Some years\r\nafterwards Jacques Coeur underwent a troublesome trial for infraction of\r\nthe rules touching the coinage of money; but thanks to a commutation of\r\nthe penalty, graciously accorded by Charles VII., he got off with a fine,\r\nand from that time forward directed all his energies towards commerce.\r\nIn 1432 a squire in the service of the Duke of Burgundy was travelling in\r\nthe Holy Land, and met him at Damascus in company with several Venetians,\r\nGenoese, Florentine, and Catalan traders with whom he was doing\r\nbusiness.  “He was,” says his contemporary, Thomas Basin, “a man\r\nunlettered and of plebeian family, but of great and ingenious mind, well\r\nversed in the practical affairs of that age.  He was the first in all\r\nFrance to build and man ships which transported to Africa and the East\r\nwoollen stuffs and other produce of the kingdom, penetrated as far as\r\nEgypt, and brought back with them silken stuffs and all manner of spices,\r\nwhich they distributed not only in France, but in Catalonia and the\r\nneighboring countries, whereas heretofore it was by means of the\r\nVenetians, the Genoese, or the Barcelonese that such supplies found their\r\nway into France.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jacques Coeur----165]\r\n\r\nJacques Coeur, temporarily established at Montpellier, became a great and\r\na celebrated merchant.  In 1433 Charles VII. put into his hands the\r\ndirection of the mint at Paris, and began to take his advice as to the\r\nadministration of the crown’s finances.  In 1440 he was appointed\r\nmoneyman to the king, ennobled together with his wife and children,\r\ncommissioned soon afterwards to draw up new regulations for the\r\nmanufacture of cloth at Bourges, and invested on his own private account\r\nwith numerous commercial privileges.  He had already at this period, it\r\nwas said, three hundred manufacturing hands in his employment, and he was\r\nworking at the same time silver, lead, and copper mines situated in the\r\nenvirons of Tarare and Lyons.  Between 1442 and 1446 he had one of his\r\nnephews sent as ambassador to Egypt, and obtained for the French consuls\r\nin the Levant the same advantages as were enjoyed by those of the most\r\nfavored nations.  Not only his favor in the eyes of the king, but his\r\nadministrative and even his political appointments, went on constantly\r\nincreasing.  Between 1444 and 1446 the king several times named him one\r\nof his commissioners to the estates of Languedoc and for the installation\r\nof the new parliament of Toulouse.  In 1446 he formed one of an embassy\r\nsent to Italy to try and acquire for France the possession of Genoa,\r\nwhich was harassed by civil dissensions.  In 1447 he received from\r\nCharles VII. a still more important commission, to bring about an\r\narrangement between the two popes elected, one under the name of Felix\r\nV., and the other under that of Nicholas V.; and he was successful.  His\r\nimmense wealth greatly contributed to his influence.  M. Pierre Clement\r\n[Jacques Coeur et Charles WE, ou la France au quinzieme siecle; t. ii.,\r\npp. 1-46] has given a list of thirty-two estates and lordships which\r\nJacques Coeur had bought either in Berry or in the neighboring provinces.\r\nHe possessed, besides, four mansions and two hostels at Lyons; mansions\r\nat Beaucaire, at Beziers, at St. Pourcain, at Marseilles, and at\r\nMontpellier; and he had built, for his own residence, at Bourges, the\r\ncelebrated hostel which still exists as an admirable model of Gothic and\r\nnational art in the fifteenth century, attempting combination with the\r\nart of Italian renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jacques Coeur’s Hostel at Bourges----169]\r\n\r\nM. Clement, in his table of Jacques Coeur’s wealth does not count either\r\nthe mines which he worked at various spots in France, nor the vast\r\ncapital, unknown, which he turned to profit in his commercial\r\nenterprises; but, on the other hand, he names, with certain et ceteras,\r\nforty-two court-personages, or king’s officers, indebted to Jacques Coeur\r\nfor large or small sums he had lent them.  We will quote but two\r\ninstances of Jacques Coeur’s financial connection, not with courtiers,\r\nhowever, but with the royal family and the king himself.  Margaret of\r\nScotland, wife of the _dauphin_, who became Louis XI., wrote with her own\r\nhand, on the 20th of July, 1445, “We, Margaret, dauphiness of Viennois,\r\ndo acknowledge to have received from Master Stephen Petit, secretary of\r\nmy lord the king, and receiver-general of his finances for Languedoc and\r\nGuienne, two thousand livres of Tours, to us given by my said lord, and\r\nto us advanced by the hands of Jacques Coeur, his moneyman, we being but\r\nlately in Lorraine, for to get silken stuff and sables to make robes for\r\nour person.”  In 1449, when Charles VII. determined to drive the English\r\nfrom Normandy, his treasury was exhausted, and he had recourse to Jacques\r\nCoeur.  “Sir,” said the trader to the king, “what I have is yours,” and\r\nlent him two hundred thousand crowns; “the effect of which was,” says\r\nJacques Duclercq, “that during, this conquest, all the men-at-arms of the\r\nKing of France, and all those who were in his service, were paid their\r\nwages month by month.”\r\n\r\nAn original document, dated 1450, which exists in the “cabinet des\r\ntitres” of the National Library, bears upon it a receipt for sixty\r\nthousand livres from Jacques Coeur to the king’s receiver-general in\r\nNormandy, “in restitution of the like sum lent by me in ready money to\r\nthe said lord in the month of August last past, on occasion of the\r\nsurrendering to his authority of the towns and castle of Cherbourg, at\r\nthat time held by the English, the ancient enemies of this realm.”  It\r\nwas probably a partial repayment of the two hundred thousand crowns lent\r\nby Jacques Coeur to the king at this juncture, according to all the\r\ncontemporary chroniclers.\r\n\r\nEnormous and unexpected wealth excites envy and suspicion at the same\r\ntime that it confers influence; and the envious before long become\r\nenemies.  Sullen murmurs against Jacques Coeur were raised in the king’s\r\nown circle; and the way in which he had begun to make his fortune--the\r\ncoinage of questionable money--furnished some specious ground for them.\r\nThere is too general an inclination amongst potentates of the earth to\r\ngive an easy ear to reasons, good or bad, for dispensing with the\r\ngratitude and respect otherwise due to those who serve them.  Charles\r\nVII., after having long been the patron and debtor of Jacques Coeur, all\r\nat once, in 1451, shared the suspicions aroused against him.  To\r\naccusations of grave abuses and malversations in money matters was added\r\none of even more importance.  Agnes Sorel had died eighteen months\r\npreviously (February 9, 1450); and on her death-bed she had appointed\r\nJacques Coeur one of the three executors of her will.  In July, 1451,\r\nJacques was at Taillebourg, in Guyenne, whence he wrote to his wife that\r\n“he was in as good case and was as well with the king as ever he had\r\nbeen, whatever anybody might say.”  Indeed, on the 22d of July Charles\r\nVII. granted him a “sum of seven hundred and seventy-two livres of Tours\r\nto help him to keep up his condition and to be more honorably equipped\r\nfor his service;” and, nevertheless, on the 31st of July, on the\r\ninformation of two persons of the court, who accused Jacques Coeur of\r\nhaving poisoned Agnes Sorel, Charles ordered his arrest and the seizure\r\nof his goods, on which he immediately levied a hundred thousand crowns\r\nfor the purposes of the war.  Commissioners extraordinary, taken from\r\namongst the king’s grand council, were charged to try him; and Charles\r\nVII. declared, it is said, that “if the said moneyman were not found\r\nliable to the charge of having poisoned or caused to be poisoned Agnes\r\nSorel, he threw up and forgave all the other cases against him.”  The\r\naccusation of poisoning was soon acknowledged to be false, and the two\r\ninformers were condemned as calumniators; but the trial was,\r\nnevertheless, proceeded with.  Jacques Coeur was accused “of having sold\r\narms to the infidels, of having coined light crowns, of having pressed on\r\nboard of his vessels, at Montpellier, several individuals, of whom one\r\nhad thrown himself into the sea from desperation, and lastly of having\r\nappropriated to himself presents made to the king, in several towns of\r\nLanguedoc, and of having practised in that country frequent exaction, to\r\nthe prejudice of the king as well as of his subjects.”  After twenty-two\r\nmonths of imprisonment, Jacques Coeur, on the 29th of May, 1453, was\r\nconvicted, in the king’s name, on divers charges, of which several\r\nentailed a capital penalty; but “whereas Pope Nicholas V. had issued a\r\nrescript and made request in favor of Jacques Coeur, and regard also\r\nbeing had to services received from him,” Charles VII. spared his life,\r\n“on condition that he should pay to the king a hundred thousand crowns by\r\nway of restitution, three hundred thousand by way of fine, and should be\r\nkept in prison until the whole claim was satisfied;” and the decree ended\r\nas follows: “We have declared and do declare all the goods of the said\r\nJacques Coeur confiscated to us, and we have banished and do banish this\r\nJacques Coeur forever from this realm, reserving thereanent our own good\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\nAfter having spent nearly three years more in prison, transported from\r\ndungeon to dungeon, Jacques Coeur, thanks to the faithful and zealous\r\naffection of a few friends, managed to escape from Beaucaire, to embark\r\nat Nice and to reach Rome, where Pope Nicholas V. welcomed him with\r\ntokens of lively interest.  Nicholas died shortly afterwards, just when\r\nhe was preparing an expedition against the Turks.  His successor,\r\nCalixtus III., carried out his design, and equipped a fleet of sixteen\r\ngalleys.  This fleet required a commander of energy, resolution, and\r\ncelebrity.  Jacques Coeur had lived and fought with Dunois, Xaintrailles,\r\nLa Hire, and the most valiant French captains; he was known and popular\r\nin Italy and the Levant; and the pope appointed him captain-general of\r\nthe expedition.  Charles VII.’s moneyman, ruined, convicted, and banished\r\nfrom France, sailed away at the head of the pope’s squadron and of some\r\nCatalan pirates to carry help against the Turks to Rhodes, Chios, Lesbos,\r\nLemnos, and the whole Grecian archipelago.  On arriving at Chios, in\r\nNovember, 1456, he fell ill there, and perceiving his end approaching,\r\nhe wrote to his king “to commend to him his children, and to beg that,\r\nconsidering the great wealth and honors he had in his time enjoyed in the\r\nking’s service, it might be the king’s good pleasure to give something to\r\nhis children, in order that they, even those of them who were secular,\r\nmight be able to live honestly, without coming to want.”  He died at\r\nChits on the 25th of November, 1456, and, according to the historian John\r\nd’Auton, who had probably lived in the society of Jacques Coeur’s\r\nchildren, “he remained interred in the church of the Cordeliers in that\r\nisland, at the centre of the choir.”\r\n\r\nWe have felt bound to represent with some detail the active and energetic\r\nlife, prosperous for a long while and afterwards so grievous and\r\nhazardous up to its very last day, of this great French merchant at the\r\nclose of the middle ages, who was the first to extend afar in Europe,\r\nAfrica, and Asia the commercial relations of France, and, after the\r\nexample of the great Italian merchants, to make an attempt to combine\r\npolitics with commerce, and to promote at one and the same time the\r\nmaterial interests of his country and the influence of his government.\r\nThere can be no doubt but that Jacques Coeur was unscrupulous and\r\nfrequently visionary as a man of business; but, at the same time, he was\r\ninventive, able, and bold, and, whilst pushing his own fortunes to the\r\nutmost, he contributed a great deal to develop, in the ways of peace, the\r\ncommercial, industrial, diplomatic, and artistic enterprise of France.\r\nIn his relations towards his king, Jacques Coeur was to Charles VII. a\r\nservant often over-adventurous, slippery, and compromising, but often\r\nalso useful, full of resource, efficient, and devoted in the hour of\r\ndifficulty.  Charles VII. was to Jacques Coeur a selfish and ungrateful\r\npatron, who contemptuously deserted the man whose brains he had sucked,\r\nand ruined him pitilessly after having himself contributed to enrich him\r\nunscrupulously.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the end of events under this long reign; all that\r\nremains is to run over the substantial results of Charles VII.’s\r\ngovernment, and the melancholy imbroglios of his latter years with his\r\nson, the turbulent, tricky, and wickedly able born-conspirator, who was\r\nto succeed him under the name of Louis XI.\r\n\r\nOne fact is at the outset to be remarked upon; it at the first blush\r\nappears singular, but it admits of easy explanation.  In the first\r\nnineteen years of his reign, from 1423 to 1442, Charles VII. very\r\nfrequently convoked the states-general, at one time of Northern France,\r\nor Langue d’oil, at another of Southern France, or Langue d’oc.\r\nTwenty-four such assemblies took place during this period at Bourges,\r\nat Selles in Berry, at Le Puy in Velay, at Mean-sur-Yevre, at Chinon,\r\nat Sully-sur-Loire, at Tours, at Orleans, at Nevers, at Carcassonne,\r\nand at different spots in Languedoc.  It was the time of the great war\r\nbetween France on the one side and England and Burgundy allied on the\r\nother, the time of intrigues incessantly recurring at court, and the time\r\nlikewise of carelessness and indolence on the part of Charles VII., more\r\ndevoted to his pleasures than regardful of his government.  He had\r\nincessant need of states-general to supply him with money and men, and\r\nsupport him through the difficulties of his position.  But when, dating\r\nfrom the peace of Arras (September 21, 1435), Charles VII., having become\r\nreconciled with the Duke of Burgundy, was deliverer from civil war, and\r\nwas at grips with none but England alone already half beaten by the\r\ndivine inspiration, the triumph, and the martyrdom of Joan of Arc, his\r\nposture and his behavior underwent a rare transformation.  Without\r\nceasing to be coldly selfish and scandalously licentious king he became\r\npractical, hard-working, statesman-like king, jealous and disposed to\r\ngovern by himself, but at the same time watchful and skilful in availing\r\nhimself of the able advisers who, whether it were by a happy accident or\r\nby his own choice, were grouped around him.  “He had his days and hours\r\nfor dealing with all sorts of men, one hour with the clergy, another with\r\nthe nobles, another with foreigners, another with mechanical folks,\r\narmorers, and gunners; and in respect of all these persons he had a full\r\nremembrance of their cases and their appointed day.  On Monday, Tuesday,\r\nand Thursday he worked with the chancellor, and got through all claims\r\nconnected with justice.  On Wednesday he first of all gave audience to\r\nthe marshals, captains, and men of war.  On the same day he held a\r\ncouncil of finance, independently of another council which was also held\r\non the same subject every Friday.”  It was by such assiduous toil that\r\nCharles VII., in concert with his advisers, was able to take in hand and\r\naccomplish, in the military, financial, and judicial system of the realm,\r\nthose bold and at the same time prudent reforms which wrested the country\r\nfrom the state of disorder, pillage, and general insecurity to which it\r\nhad been a prey, and commenced the era of that great monarchical\r\nadministration, which, in spite of many troubles and vicissitudes, was\r\ndestined to be, during more than three centuries, the government of\r\nFrance.  The constable De Richemont and marshal De la Fayette were, in\r\nrespect of military matters, Charles VII.’s principal advisers; and it\r\nwas by their counsel and with their co-operation that he substituted for\r\nfeudal service and for the bands of wandering mercenaries (routiers),\r\nmustered and maintained by hap-hazard, a permanent army, regularly\r\nlevied, provided for, paid, and commanded, and charged with the duty of\r\nkeeping order at home, and at the same time subserving abroad the\r\ninterests and policy of the state.  In connection with, and as a natural\r\nconsequence of this military system, Charles VII., on his own sole\r\nauthority, established certain permanent imposts with the object of\r\nmaking up any deficiency in the royal treasury, whilst waiting for a vote\r\nof such taxes extraordinary as might be demanded of the states-general.\r\nJacques Coeur, the two brothers Bureau, Martin Gouge, Michel Lailler,\r\nWilliam Cousinot, and many other councillors, of burgher origin, labored\r\nzealously to establish this administrative system, so prompt and freed\r\nfrom all independent discussion.  Weary of wars, irregularities, and\r\nsufferings, France, in the fifteenth century, asked for nothing but peace\r\nand security; and so soon as the kingship showed that it had an intention\r\nand was in a condition to provide her with them, the nation took little\r\nor no trouble about political guarantees which as yet it knew neither how\r\nto establish nor how to exercise; its right to them was not disputed in\r\nprinciple, they were merely permitted to fall into desuetude; and Charles\r\nVII., who during the first half of his reign had twenty-four times\r\nassembled the states-general to ask them for taxes and soldiers, was able\r\nin the second to raise personally both soldiers and taxes without drawing\r\nforth any complaint hardly, save from his contemporary historian, the\r\nBishop of Lisieux, Thomas Basin, who said, “Into such misery and\r\nservitude is fallen the realm of France, heretofore so noble and free,\r\nthat all the inhabitants are openly declared by the generals of finance\r\nand their clerks taxable at the will of the king, without anybody’s\r\ndaring to murmur or even ask for mercy.”  There is at every juncture, and\r\nin all ages of the world, a certain amount, though varying very much, of\r\ngood order, justice, and security, without which men cannot get on; and\r\nwhen they lack it, either through the fault of those who govern them or\r\nthrough their own fault, they seek after it with the blind eyes of\r\npassion, and are ready to accept it, no matter what power may procure it\r\nfor them, or what price it may cost them.  Charles VII. was a prince\r\nneither to be respected nor to be loved, and during many years his reign\r\nhad not been a prosperous one; but “he re-quickened justice, which had\r\nbeen a long while dead,” says a chronicler devoted to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy; “he put an end to the tyrannies and exactions of the\r\nmen-at-arms, and out of an infinity of murderers and robbers he formed\r\nmen of resolution and honest life; he made regular paths in murderous\r\nwoods and forests, all roads safe, all towns peaceful, all nationalities\r\nof his kingdom tranquil; he chastised the evil and honored the good, and\r\nhe was sparing of human blood.”\r\n\r\nLet it be added, in accordance with contemporary testimony, that at the\r\nsame time that he established an all but arbitrary rule in military and\r\nfinancial matters, Charles VII. took care that “practical justice, in the\r\ncase of every individual, was promptly rendered to poor as well as rich,\r\nto small as well as great; he forbade all trafficking in the offices of\r\nthe magistracy, and every time that a place became vacant in a parliament\r\nhe made no nomination to it, save on the presentations of the court.”\r\n\r\nQuestions of military, financial, and judicial organization were not the\r\nonly ones which occupied the government of Charles VII.  He attacked also\r\necclesiastical questions, which were at that period a subject of\r\npassionate discussion in Christian Europe amongst the councils of the\r\nChurch and in the closets of princes.  The celebrated ordinance, known by\r\nthe name of Pragmatic Sanction, which Charles VII. issued at Bourges on\r\nthe 7th of July, 1438, with the concurrence of a grand national council,\r\nlaic and ecclesiastical, was directed towards the carrying out, in the\r\ninternal regulations of the French Church, and in the relations either of\r\nthe State with the Church in France, or of the Church of France with the\r\npapacy, of reforms long since desired or dreaded by the different powers\r\nand interests.  It would be impossible to touch here upon these difficult\r\nand delicate questions without going far beyond the limits imposed upon\r\nthe writer of this history.  All that can be said is, that there was no\r\nlack of a religious spirit, or of a liberal spirit, in the Pragmatic\r\nSanction of Charles VII., and that the majority of the measures contained\r\nin it were adopted with the approbation of the greater part of the French\r\nclergy, as well as of educated laymen in France.\r\n\r\nIn whatever light it is regarded, the government of Charles VII. in the\r\nlatter part of his reign brought him not only in France, but throughout\r\nEurope, a great deal of fame and power.  When he had driven the English\r\nout of his kingdom, he was called Charles the Victorious; and when he had\r\nintroduced into the internal regulations of the state so many important\r\nand effective reforms, he was called Charles the Well-served.  “The sense\r\nhe had by nature,” says his historian Chastellain, “had been increased to\r\ntwice as much again, in his straitened fortunes, by long constraint and\r\nperilous dangers, which sharpened his wits perforce.”  “He is the king of\r\nkings,” was said of him by the Doge of Venice, Francis Foscari, a good\r\njudge of policy; “there is no doing without him.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the close, so influential and so tranquil, of his reign,\r\nCharles VII. was, in his individual and private life, the most desolate,\r\nthe most harassed, and the most unhappy man in his kingdom.  In 1442 and\r\n1450 he had lost the two women who had been, respectively, the most\r\ndevoted and most useful, and the most delightful and dearest to him, his\r\nmother-in-law, Yolande of Arragon, Queen of Sicily, and his favorite,\r\nAgnes Sorel.  His avowed intimacy with Agnes, and even, independently of\r\nher and after her death, the scandalous licentiousness of his morals, had\r\njustly offended his virtuous wife, Mary of Anjou, the only lady of the\r\nroyal establishment who survived him.  She had brought him twelve\r\nchildren, and the eldest, the _dauphin_ Louis, after having from his very\r\nyouth behaved in a factious, harebrained, turbulent way towards the king\r\nhis father, had become at one time an open rebel, at another a venomous\r\nconspirator and a dangerous enemy.  At his birth in 1423, he had been\r\nnamed Louis in remembrance of his ancestor, St. Louis, and in hopes that\r\nhe would resemble him.  In 1440, at seventeen years of age, he allied\r\nhimself with the great lords, who were displeased with the new military\r\nsystem established by Charles VII., and allowed himself to be drawn by\r\nthem into the transient rebellion known by the name of Praguery.  When\r\nthe king, having put it down, refused to receive the rebels to favor, the\r\n_dauphin_ said to his father, “My lord, I must go back with them, then;\r\nfor so I promised them.”  “Louis,” replied the king, “the gates are open,\r\nand if they are not high enough I will have sixteen or twenty fathom of\r\nwall knocked down for you, that you may go whither it seems best to you.”\r\n Charles VII. had made his son marry Margaret Stuart of Scotland, that\r\ncharming princess who was so smitten with the language and literature of\r\nFrance that, coming one day upon the poet Alan Chartier asleep upon a\r\nbench, she kissed him on the forehead in the presence of her mightily\r\nastonished train, for he was very ugly.  The _dauphin_ rendered his wife\r\nso wretched that she died in 1445, at the age of one and twenty, with\r\nthese words upon her lips: “O! fie on life!  Speak to me no more of it!”\r\n In 1449, just when the king his father was taking up arms to drive the\r\nEnglish out of Normandy, the _dauphin_ Louis, who was now living entirely\r\nin Dauphiny, concluded at Briancon a secret league with the Duke of Savoy\r\n“against the ministers of the King of France, his enemies.”  In 1456, in\r\norder to escape from the perils brought upon him by the plots which he,\r\nin the heart of Dauphiny, was incessantly hatching against his father,\r\nLouis fled from Grenoble and went to take refuge in Brussels with the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, who willingly received him, at the\r\nsame time excusing himself to Charles VII. “on the ground of the respect\r\nhe owed to the son of his suzerain,” and putting at the disposal of\r\nLouis, “his guest,” a pension of thirty-six thousand livres.  “He has\r\nreceived the fox at his court,” said Charles: “he will soon see what will\r\nbecome of his chickens.”  But the pleasantries of the king did not chase\r\naway the sorrows of the father.  “Mine enemies have full trust in me,”\r\n said Charles, “but my son will have none.  If he had but once spoken with\r\nme, he would have known full well that he ought to have neither doubts\r\nnor fears.  On my royal word, if he will but come to me, when he has\r\nopened his heart and learned my intentions, he may go away again\r\nwhithersoever it seems good to him.”  Charles, in his old age and his\r\nsorrow, forgot how distrustful and how fearful he himself had been.  “It\r\nis ever your pleasure,” wrote one of his councillors to him in a burst of\r\nfrankness, “to be shut up in castles, wretched places, and all sorts of\r\nlittle closets, without showing yourself and listening to the complaints\r\nof your poor people.”  Charles VII. had shown scarcely more confidence to\r\nhis son than to his people.  Louis yielded neither to words, nor to\r\nsorrows of which proofs were reaching him nearly every day.  He remained\r\nimpassive at the Duke of Burgundy’s, where he seemed to be waiting with\r\nscandalous indifference for the news of his father’s death.  Charles sank\r\ninto a state of profound melancholy and general distrust.  He had his\r\ndoctor, Adam Fumee, put in prison; persuaded himself that his son had\r\nwished, and was still wishing, to poison him; and refused to take any\r\nkind of nourishment.  No representation, no solicitation, could win him\r\nfrom his depression and obstinacy.  It was in vain that Charles, Duke of\r\nBerry, his favorite child, offered to first taste the food set before\r\nhim.  It was in vain that his servants “represented to him with tears,”\r\n says Bossuet, “what madness it was to cause his own death for fear of\r\ndying; when at last he would have made an effort to eat, it was too late,\r\nand he must die.”  On the 2nd of July, 1461, he asked what day it was,\r\nand was told that it was St. Magdalen’s day.  “Ah!” said he, “I do laud\r\nmy God, and thank Him for that it hath pleased Him that the most sinful\r\nman in the world should die on the sinful woman’s day!  Dampmartin,” said\r\nhe to the count of that name, who was leaning over his bed, “I do beseech\r\nyou that after my death you will serve so far as you can the little lord,\r\nmy son Charles.”  He called his confessor, received the sacraments, gave\r\norders that he should be buried at St. Denis beside the king his father,\r\nand expired.  No more than his son Louis, though for different reasons,\r\nwas his wife, Queen Mary of Anjou, at his side.  She was living at\r\nChinon, whither she had removed a long while before by order of the king\r\nher husband.  Thus, deserted by them of his own household, and disgusted\r\nwith his own life, died that king of whom a contemporary chronicler,\r\nwhilst recommending his soul to God, re-marked, “When he was alive, he\r\nwas a right wise and valiant lord, and he left his kingdom united, and in\r\ngood case as to justice and tranquillity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.----LOUIS XI.  (1461-1483.)\r\n\r\nLouis XI. was thirty-eight years old, and had been living for five years\r\nin voluntary exile at the castle of Genappe, in Hainault, beyond the\r\ndominions of the king his father, and within those of Philip the Good,\r\nDuke of Burgundy, when, on the 23d of July, 1461, the day after Charles\r\nVII.’s death, he learned that he was King of France.  He started at once\r\nto return to his own country, and take possession of his kingdom.  He\r\narrived at Rheims on the 14th of August, was solemnly crowned there on\r\nthe 18th, in presence of the two courts of France and Burgundy, and on\r\nthe 30th made his entry into Paris, within which he had not set foot for\r\nsix and twenty years. In 1482, twenty-one years afterwards, he, sick and\r\nalmost dying in his turn at his castle of Plessis-les-Tours, went,\r\nnevertheless, to Amboise, where his son the _dauphin_, who was about to\r\nbecome Charles VIII., and whom he had not seen for several years, was\r\nliving.  “I do expressly enjoin upon you,” said the father to the son,\r\n“as my last counsel and my last instructions, not to change a single one\r\nof the chief officers of the crown.  When my father.  King Charles VII.,\r\nwent to God, and I myself came to the throne, I disappointed [i.e.,\r\ndeprived of their appointments] all the good and notable knights of the\r\nkingdom who had aided and served my said father in conquering Normandy\r\nand Guienne, in driving the English out of the kingdom, and in restoring\r\nit to peace and good order, for so I found it, and right rich also.\r\nTherefrom much mischief came to me, for thence I had the war called the\r\nCommon Weal, which all but cost me my crown.”\r\n\r\nWith the experience and paternal care of an old man, whom the near\r\nprospect of death rendered perfectly disinterested, wholly selfish as his\r\nown life had been, Louis’s heart was bent upon saving his son from the\r\nfirst error which he himself had committed on mounting the throne.\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Dunois on rising from table at the funeral-banquet held\r\nat the abbey of St. Denis in honor of the obsequies of King Charles VII.,\r\n“we have lost our master; let each look after himself.”  The old warrior\r\nforesaw that the new reign would not be like that which had just ended.\r\nCharles VII. had been a prince of indolent disposition, more inclined to\r\npleasure than ambition, whom the long and severe trials of his life had\r\nmoulded to government without his having any passion for governing, and\r\nwho had become in a quiet way a wise and powerful king, without any eager\r\ndesire to be incessantly and everywhere chief actor and master.  His son\r\nLouis, on the contrary, was completely possessed with a craving for\r\ndoing, talking, agitating, domineering, and reaching, no matter by what\r\nmeans, the different and manifold ends he proposed to himself.  Anything\r\nbut prepossessing in appearance, supported on long and thin shanks,\r\nvulgar in looks and often designedly ill-dressed, and undignified in his\r\nmanners though haughty in mind, he was powerful by the sheer force of a\r\nmind marvellously lively, subtle, unerring, ready, and inventive, and of\r\na character indefatigably active, and pursuing success as a passion\r\nwithout any scruple or embarrassment in the employment of means.  His\r\ncontemporaries, after observing his reign for some time, gave him the\r\nname of the universal spider, so relentlessly did he labor to weave a web\r\nof which he himself occupied the centre and extended the filaments in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was king, he indulged himself with that first piece of\r\nvindictive satisfaction of which he was in his last moments obliged to\r\nacknowledge the mistake.  At Rheims, at the time of his coronation, the\r\naged and judicious Duke Philip of Burgundy had begged him to forgive all\r\nthose who had offended him.  Louis promised to do so, with the exception,\r\nhowever, of seven persons whom he did not name.  They were the most\r\nfaithful and most able advisers of the king his father, those who had\r\nbest served Charles VII. even in his embroilments with the _dauphin_, his\r\nconspiring and rebellious son, viz., Anthony de Chabannes, Count of\r\nDampmartin, Peter de Breze, Andrew de Laval, Juvenal des Ursins, &c.\r\nSome lost their places, and were even, for a while, subjected to\r\npersecution; the others, remaining still at court, received there many\r\nmarks of the king’s disfavor.  On the other hand, Louis made a show of\r\ntreating graciously the men who had most incurred and deserved disgrace\r\nat his father’s hands, notably the Duke of Alencon and the Count of\r\nArmagnac.  Nor was it only in respect of persons that he departed from\r\npaternal tradition; he rejected it openly in the case of one of the most\r\nimportant acts of Charles VII.’s reign, the Pragmatic Sanction, issued by\r\nthat prince at Bourses, in 1438, touching the internal regulations of the\r\nChurch of France and its relations towards the papacy.  The popes, and\r\nespecially Pius II., Louis XI.’s contemporary, had constantly and\r\nvigorously protested against that act.  Barely four months after his\r\naccession, on the 27th of November, 1461, Louis, in order to gain favor\r\nwith the pope, abrogated the Pragmatic Sanction, and informed the pope of\r\nthe fact in a letter full of devotion.  There was great joy at Rome, and\r\nthe pope replied to the king’s letter in the strongest terms of gratitude\r\nand commendation.  But Louis’s courtesy had not been so disinterested as\r\nit was prompt.  He had hoped that Pius II. would abandon the cause of\r\nFerdinand of Arragon, a claimant to the throne of Naples, and would\r\nuphold that of his rival, the French prince, John of Anjou, Duke of\r\nCalabria, whose champion Louis had declared himself.  He bade his\r\nambassador at Rome to remind the pope of the royal hopes.  “You know,”\r\n said the ambassador to Pius II., “it is only on this condition that\r\nthe king my master abolished the Pragmatic; he was pleased to desire that\r\nin his kingdom full obedience should be rendered to you; he demands, on\r\nthe other hand, that you should be pleased to be a friend to France;\r\notherwise I have orders to bid all the French cardinals withdraw, and you\r\ncannot doubt but that they will obey.”  But Pius II. was more proud than\r\nLouis XI. dared to be imperious.  He answered, “We are under very great\r\nobligations to the King of France, but that gives him no right to exact\r\nfrom us things contrary to justice and to our honor; we have sent aid to\r\nFerdinand by virtue of the treaties we have with him; let the king your\r\nmaster compel the Duke of Anjou to lay down arms and prosecute his rights\r\nby course of justice, and if Ferdinand refuse to submit thereto we will\r\ndeclare against him; but we cannot promise more.  If the French who are\r\nat our court wish to withdraw, the gates are open to them.”  The king, a\r\nlittle ashamed at the fruitlessness of his concession and of his threat,\r\nhad for an instant some desire to re-establish the Pragmatic Sanction,\r\nfor which the parliament of Paris had taken up the cudgels; but, all\r\nconsidered, he thought it better to put up in silence with his rebuff,\r\nand pay the penalty for a rash concession, than to get involved with the\r\ncourt of Rome in a struggle of which he could not measure the gravity;\r\nand he contented himself with letting the parliament maintain in\r\nprinciple and partially keep up the Pragmatic.  This was his first\r\napprenticeship in that outward resignation and patience, amidst his own\r\nmistakes, of which he was destined to be called upon more than once in\r\nthe course of his life to make a humble but skilful use.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that at the pinnacle of government and in his court\r\nLouis was thus making his power felt, and was engaging a new set of\r\nservants, he was zealously endeavoring to win over, everywhere, the\r\nmiddle classes and the populace.  He left Rouen in the hands of its own\r\ninhabitants; in Guienne, in Auvergne, at Tours, he gave the burgesses\r\nauthority to assemble, and his orders to the royal agents were,\r\n“Whatever is done see that it be answered for unto us by two of the most\r\nnotable burgesses of the principal cities.”  At Rheims the rumor ran that\r\nunder King Louis there would be no more tax or talliage.  When\r\ndeputations went before him to complain of the weight of imposts, he\r\nwould say, “I thank you, my dear and good friends, for making such\r\nremonstrances to me; I have nothing more at heart than to put an end to\r\nall sorts of exactions, and to re-establish my kingdom in its ancient\r\nliberties.  I have just been passing five years in the countries of my\r\nuncle of Burgundy; and there I saw good cities mighty rich and full of\r\ninhabitants, and folks well clad, well housed, well off, lacking nothing;\r\nthe commerce there is great, and the communes there have fine privileges.\r\nWhen I came into my own kingdom I saw, on the contrary, houses in ruins,\r\nfields without tillage, men and women in rags, faces pinched and pale.\r\nIt is a great pity, and my soul is filled with sorrow at it.  All my\r\ndesire is to apply a remedy thereto, and, with God’s help, we will bring\r\nit to pass.”  The good folks departed, charmed with such familiarity, so\r\nprodigal of hope; but facts before long gave the lie to words.  “When the\r\ntime came for renewing at Rheims the claim for local taxes, the people\r\nshowed opposition, and all the papers were burned in the open street.\r\nThe king employed stratagem.  In order not to encounter overt resistance,\r\nhe caused a large number of his folks to disguise themselves as tillers\r\nor artisans; and so entering the town, they were masters of it before the\r\npeople could think of defending themselves.  The ringleaders of the\r\nrebellion were drawn and quartered, and about a hundred persons were\r\nbeheaded or hanged.  At Angers, at Alencon, and at Aurillac, there were\r\nsimilar outbursts similarly punished.”  From that moment it was easy to\r\nprognosticate that with the new king familiarity would not prevent\r\nseverity, or even cruelty.  According to the requirements of the crisis\r\nLouis had no more hesitation about violating than about making promises;\r\nand, all the while that he was seeking after popularity, he intended to\r\nmake his power felt at any price.\r\n\r\nHow could he have done without heavy imposts and submission on the part\r\nof the tax-payers?  For it was not only at home in his own kingdom that\r\nhe desired to be chief actor and master.  He pushed his ambition and his\r\nactivity abroad into divers European states.  In Italy he had his own\r\nclaimant to the throne of Naples in opposition to the King of Arragon’s.\r\nIn Spain the Kings of Arragon and of Castile were in a state of rivalry\r\nand war.  A sedition broke out in Catalonia.  Louis XI. lent the King of\r\nArragon three hundred and fifty thousand golden crowns to help him in\r\nraising eleven hundred lances, and reducing the rebels.  Civil war was\r\ndevastating England.  The houses of York and Lancaster were disputing the\r\ncrown.  Louis XI. kept up relations with both sides; and without\r\nembroiling himself with the Duke of York, who became Edward IV., he\r\nreceived at Chinon the heroic Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI., and\r\nlent twenty thousand pounds sterling to that prince, then disthroned, who\r\nundertook either to repay them within a year or to hand over Calais, when\r\nhe was re-established upon his throne, to the King of France.  In the\r\nsame way John II., King of Arragon, had put Roussillon and Cerdagne into\r\nthe hands of Louis XI., as a security for the loan of three hundred and\r\nfifty thousand crowns he had borrowed.  Amidst all the plans and\r\nenterprises of his personal ambition Louis was seriously concerned for\r\nthe greatness of France; but he drew upon her resources, and compromised\r\nher far beyond what was compatible with her real interests, by mixing\r\nhimself up, at every opportunity and by every sort of intrigue, with the\r\naffairs and quarrels of the kings and peoples around him.\r\n\r\nIn France itself he had quite enough of questions to be solved and perils\r\nto be surmounted to absorb and satisfy the most vigilant and most active\r\nof men.  Four princes of very unequal power, but all eager for\r\nindependence and preponderance, viz., Charles, Duke of Berry, his\r\nbrother; Francis II., Duke of Brittany; Philip the Good, Duke of\r\nBurgundy, his uncle; and John, Duke of Bourbon, his brother-in-law, were\r\nvassals whom he found very troublesome, and ever on the point of becoming\r\ndangerous.  It was not long before he had a proof of it.  In 1463, two\r\nyears after Louis’s accession, the Duke of Burgundy sent one of his most\r\ntrusty servants, John of Croy, Sire de Chimay, to complain of certain\r\nroyal acts, contrary, he said, to the treaty of Arras, which, in 1435,\r\nhad regulated the relations between Burgundy and the crown.  The envoy\r\nhad great difficulty in getting audience of the king, who would not even\r\nlisten for more than a single moment, and that as he was going out of his\r\nroom, when, almost without heeding, he said abruptly, “What manner of\r\nman, then, is this Duke of Burgundy?  Is he of other metal than the other\r\nlords of the realm?”  “Yes, sir,” replied Chimay, “he is of other metal;\r\nfor he protected you and maintained you against the will of your father\r\nKing Charles, and against the opinion of all those who were opposed to\r\nyou in the kingdom, which no other prince or lord would have dared to\r\ndo.”  Louis went back into his room without a word.  “How dared you speak\r\nso to the king,” said Dunois to Chimay.  “Had I been fifty leagues away\r\nfrom here,” said the Burgundian, “and had I thought that the king had an\r\nidea only of addressing such words to me, I would have come back express\r\nto speak to him as I have spoken.”  The Duke of Brittany was less\r\npuissant and less proudly served than the Duke of Burgundy; but, being\r\nvain and inconsiderate, he was incessantly attempting to exalt himself\r\nabove his condition of vassal, and to raise his duchy into a sovereignty,\r\nand when his pretensions were rejected he entered, at one time with the\r\nKing of England and at another with the Duke of Burgundy and the\r\nmalcontents of France, upon intrigues which amounted very nearly to\r\ntreason against the king his suzerain.  Charles, Louis’s younger brother,\r\nwas a soft and mediocre but jealous and timidly ambitious prince; he\r\nremembered, moreover, the preference and the wishes manifested on his\r\naccount by Charles VII., their common father, on his death-bed, and he\r\nconsidered his position as Duke of Berry very inferior to the hopes he\r\nbelieved himself entitled to nourish.  Duke John of Bourbon, on espousing\r\na sister of Louis XI., had flattered himself that this marriage and the\r\nremembrance of the valor he had displayed, in 1450, at the battle of\r\nFormigny, would be worth to him at least the sword of constable; but\r\nLouis had refused to give it him.  When all these great malcontents saw\r\nLouis’s popularity on the decline, and the king engaged abroad in divers\r\npolitical designs full of onerousness or embarrassment, they considered\r\nthe moment to have come, and, at the end of 1464, formed together an\r\nalliance “for to remonstrate with the king,” says Commynes, “upon the bad\r\norder and injustice he kept up in his kingdom, considering themselves\r\nstrong enough to force him if he would not mend his ways; and this war\r\nwas called the common weal, because it was undertaken under color of\r\nbeing for the _common weal_ of the kingdom, the which was soon converted\r\ninto private weal.”  The aged Duke of Burgundy, sensible and weary as he\r\nwas, gave only a hesitating and slack adherence to the league; but his\r\nson Charles, Count of Charolais, entered into it passionately, and the\r\nfather was no more in a condition to resist his son than he was inclined\r\nto follow him.  The number of the declared malcontents increased rapidly;\r\nand the chiefs received at Paris itself, in the church of Notre Dame, the\r\nadhesion and the signatures of those who wished to join them.  They all\r\nwore, for recognition’s sake, a band of red silk round their waists, and,\r\n“there were more than five hundred,” says Oliver de la Marche, a\r\nconfidential servant of the Count of Charolais, “princes as well as\r\nknights, dames, damsels, and esquires, who were well acquainted with this\r\nalliance without the king’s knowing anything as yet about it.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe the chronicler’s last assertion.  Louis XI.,\r\nit is true, was more distrustful than far-sighted, and, though he placed\r\nbut little reliance in his advisers and servants, he had so much\r\nconfidence in himself, his own sagacity, and his own ability, that he\r\neasily deluded himself about the perils of his position; but the facts\r\nwhich have just been set forth were too serious and too patent to have\r\nescaped his notice.  However that may be, he had no sooner obtained a\r\nclear insight into the league of the princes than he set to work with his\r\nusual activity and knowledge of the world to checkmate it.  To rally\r\ntogether his own partisans and to separate his foes, such was the twofold\r\nend he pursued, at first with some success.  In a meeting of the princes\r\nwhich was held at Tours, and in which friends and enemies were still\r\nmingled together, he used language which could not fail to meet their\r\nviews.  “He was powerless,” he said, “to remedy the evils of the kingdom\r\nwithout the love and fealty of the princes of the blood and the other\r\nlords; they were the pillars of the state; without their help one man\r\nalone could not bear the weight of the crown.”  Many of those present\r\ndeclared their fealty.  “You are our king, our sovereign lord,” said King\r\nRene, Duke of Anjou; “we thank you for the kind, gracious, and honest\r\nwords you have just used to us.  I say to you, on behalf of all our lords\r\nhere present, that we will serve you in respect of and against every one,\r\naccording as it may please you to order us.”  Louis, by a manifesto,\r\naddressed himself also to the good towns and to all his kingdom.  He\r\ndeplored therein the enticements which had been suffered to draw away\r\n“his brother, the Duke of Berry and other princes, churchmen, and nobles,\r\nwho would never have consented to this league if they had borne in mind\r\nthe horrible calamities of the kingdom, and especially the English, those\r\nancient enemies, who might well come down again upon it as heretofore\r\n.  .  .  .  They proclaim,” said he, “that they will abolish the imposts;\r\nthat is what has always been declared by the seditious and rebellious;\r\nbut, instead of relieving, they ruin the poor people.  Had I been willing\r\nto augment their pay, and permit them to trample their vassals under foot\r\nas in time past, they would never have given a thought to the common\r\nweal.  They pretend that they desire to establish order everywhere, and\r\nyet they cannot endure it anywhere; whilst I, without drawing from my\r\npeople more than was drawn by the late king, pay my men-at-arms well, and\r\nkeep them in a good state of discipline.”\r\n\r\nLouis, in his latter words, was a little too boastful.  He had very much\r\naugmented the imposts without assembling the estates, and without caring\r\nfor the old public liberties.  If he frequently repressed local tyranny\r\non the part of the lords, he did not deny himself the practice of it.\r\nAmongst other tastes, he was passionately fond of the chase; and,\r\nwherever he lived, he put it down amongst his neighbors, noble or other,\r\nwithout any regard for rights of lordship.  Hounds, hawking birds, nets,\r\nsnares, all the implements of hunting were forbidden.  He even went so\r\nfar, it is said, on one occasion, as to have two gentlemen’s ears cut off\r\nfor killing a hare on their own property.  Nevertheless, the publication\r\nof his manifesto did him good service.  Auvergne, Dauphiny, Languedoc,\r\nLyon and Bordeaux turned a deaf ear to all temptations from the league of\r\nprinces.  Paris, above all, remained faithful to the king.  Orders were\r\ngiven at the Hotel de Ville that the principal gates of the city should\r\nbe walled up, and that there should be a night watch on the ramparts; and\r\nthe burgesses were warned to lay in provision of arms and victual.\r\nMarshal Joachim Rouault, lord of Gamaches, arrived at Paris on the 30th\r\nof June, 1465, at the head of a body of men-at-arms, to protect the city\r\nagainst the Count of Charolais, who was coming up; and the king himself,\r\nnot content with despatching four of his chief officers to thank the\r\nParisians for their loyal zeal, wrote to them that he would send the\r\nqueen to lie in at Paris, “the city he loved most in the world.”\r\n\r\nLouis would have been glad to have nothing to do but to negotiate and\r\ntalk.  Though he was personally brave, he did not like war and its\r\nunforeseen issues.  He belonged to the class of ambitious despots who\r\nprefer stratagem to force.  But the very ablest speeches and artifices,\r\neven if they do not remain entirely fruitless, are not sufficient to\r\nreduce matters promptly to order when great interests are threatened,\r\npassions violently excited, and factions let loose in the arena.  Between\r\nthe League of the Common Neal and Louis XI. there was a question too\r\ngreat to be, at the very outset, settled peacefully.  It was feudalism in\r\ndecline at grips with the kingship, which had been growing greater and\r\ngreater for two centuries.  The lords did not trust the king’s promises;\r\nand one amongst those lords was too powerful to yield without a fight.\r\nAt the beginning Louis had, in Auvergne and in Berry, some successes,\r\nwhich decided a few of the rebels, the most insignificant, to accept\r\ntruces and enter upon parleys; but the great princes, the Dukes of\r\nBurgundy, Brittany, and Berry, waxed more and more angry.  The aged Duke\r\nof Burgundy, Philip the Good himself, sobered and wearied as he was,\r\nthrew himself passionately into the struggle.  “Go,” said he to his son,\r\nCount Charles of Charolais, “maintain thine honor well, and, if thou have\r\nneed of a hundred thousand more men to deliver thee from difficulty, I\r\nmyself will lead them to thee.”  Charles marched promptly on Paris.\r\nLouis, on his side, moved thither, with the design and in the hope of\r\ngetting in there without fighting.  But the Burgundians, posted at St.\r\nDenis and the environs, barred his approach.  His seneschal, Peter de\r\nBreze, advised him to first attack the Bretons, who were advancing to\r\njoin the Burgundians.  Louis, looking at him somewhat mistrustfully,\r\nsaid, “You, too, Sir Seneschal, have signed this League of the Common\r\nWeal.”  “Ay, sir,” answered Brez, with a laugh, “they have my signature,\r\nbut you have myself.”  “Would you be afraid to try conclusions with the\r\nBurgundians?” continued the king.  “Nay, verily,” replied the seneschal;\r\n“I will let that be seen in the first battle.”  Louis continued his march\r\non Paris.  The two armies met at Montlhery, on the 16th of July, 1465.\r\nBreze, who commanded the king’s advance-guard, immediately went into\r\naction, and was one of the first to be killed.  Louis came up to his\r\nassistance with troops in rather loose order; the affair became hot and\r\ngeneral; the French for a moment wavered, and a rumor ran through the\r\nranks that the king had just been killed.\r\n\r\n“No, my friends,” said Louis, taking off his helmet, “no, I am not dead;\r\ndefend your king with good courage.”  The wavering was transferred to the\r\nBurgundians.  Count Charles himself was so closely pressed that a French\r\nman-at-arms laid his hand on him, saying, “Yield you, my lord; I know you\r\nwell; let not yourself be slain.”  “A rescue!” cried Charles; “I’ll not\r\nleave you, my friends, unless by death: I am here to live and die with\r\nyou.”  He was wounded by a sword-thrust which entered his neck between\r\nhis helmet and his breastplate, badly fastened.  Disorder set in on both\r\nsides, without either’s being certain how things were, or being able to\r\nconsider itself victorious.  Night came on; and French and Burgundians\r\nencamped before Montlhery.  The Count of Charolais sat down on two heaps\r\nof straw, and had his wound dressed.  Around him were the stripped\r\ncorpses of the slain.  As they were being moved to make room for him, a\r\npoor wounded creature, somewhat revived by the motion, recovered\r\nconsciousness and asked for a drink.  The count made them pour down his\r\nthroat a drop of his own mixture, for he never drank wine.  The wounded\r\nman came completely to himself, and recovered.  It was one of the archers\r\nof his guard.  Next day news was brought to Charles that the Bretons were\r\ncoming up, with their own duke, the Duke of Berry, and Count Dunois at\r\ntheir head.  He went as far as Etampes to meet them, and informed them of\r\nwhat had just happened.  The Duke of Berry was very much distressed; it\r\nwas a great pity, he said, that so many people had been killed; he\r\nheartily wished that the war had never been begun.  “Did you hear,” said\r\nthe Count of Charolais to his servants, “how yonder fellow talks?  He is\r\nupset at the sight of seven or eight hundred wounded men going about the\r\ntown, folks who are nothing to him, and whom he does not even know; he\r\nwould be still more upset if the matter touched him nearly; he is just\r\nthe sort of fellow to readily make his own terms and leave us stuck in\r\nthe mud; we must secure other friends.”  And he forthwith made one of his\r\npeople post off to England, to draw closer the alliance between Burgundy\r\nand Edward IV.\r\n\r\nLouis, meanwhile, after passing a day at Corbeil, had once more, on the\r\n18th of July, entered Paris, the object of his chief solicitude.  He\r\ndismounted at his lieutenant’s, the Sire de Meinn’s, and asked for some\r\nsupper.  Several persons, burgesses and their wives, took supper with\r\nhim.  He excited their lively interest by describing to them the battle\r\nof Montlhery, the danger he had run there, and the scenes which had been\r\nenacted, adopting at one time a pathetic and at another a bantering tone,\r\nand exciting by turns the emotion and the laughter of his audience.  In\r\nthree days, he said, he would return to fight his enemies, in order to\r\nfinish the war; but he had not enough of men-at-arms, and all had not at\r\nthat moment such good spirits as he.  He passed a fortnight in Paris,\r\ndevoting himself solely to the task of winning the hearts of the\r\nParisians, reducing imposts, giving audience to everybody, lending a\r\nfavorable ear to every opinion offered him, making no inquiry as to who\r\nhad been more or less faithful to him, showing clemency without appearing\r\nto be aware of it, and not punishing with severity even those who had\r\nserved as guides to the Burgundians in the pillaging of the villages\r\naround Paris.  A crier of the Chatelet, who had gone crying about the\r\nstreets the day on which the Burgundians attacked the gate of St. Denis,\r\nwas sentenced only to a month’s imprisonment, bread and water, and a\r\nflogging.  He was marched through the city in a night-man’s cart; and the\r\nking, meeting the procession, called out, as he passed, to the\r\nexecutioner, “Strike hard, and spare not that ribald; he has well\r\ndeserved it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Burgundians were approaching Paris and pressing it more\r\nclosely every day.  Their different allies in the League were coming up\r\nwith troops to join them, including even some of those who, after having\r\nsuffered reverses in Auvergne, had concluded truces with the king.  The\r\nforces scattered around Paris amounted, it is said, to fifty thousand\r\nmen, and occupied Charenton, Conflans, St. Maur, and St. Denis, making\r\nready for a serious attack upon the place.  Louis, notwithstanding his\r\nfirm persuasion that things always went ill wherever he was not present\r\nin person, left Paris for Rouen, to call out and bring up the regulars\r\nand reserves of Normandy.  In his absence, interviews and parleys took\r\nplace between besiegers and besieged.  The former, found partisans\r\namongst the inhabitants of Paris, in the Hotel de Ville itself.  The\r\nCount de Dunois made capital of all the grievances of the League against\r\nthe king’s government, and declared that, if the city refused to receive\r\nthe princes, the authors of this refusal would have to answer for\r\nwhatever misery, loss, and damage might come of it; and, in spite of all\r\nefforts on the part of the king’s officers and friends, some wavering was\r\nmanifested in certain quarters.  But there arrived from Normandy\r\nconsiderable re-enforcements, announcing the early return of the king.\r\nAnd, in fact, he entered Paris on the 28th of August, the mass of the\r\npeople testifying their joy and singing “Noel.”  Louis made as if he knew\r\nnothing of what had happened in his absence, and gave nobody a black\r\nlook; only four or five burgesses, too much compromised by their\r\nrelations with the besiegers, were banished to Orleans.  Sharp skirmishes\r\nwere frequent all round the place; there was cannonading on both sides;\r\nand some balls from Paris came tumbling about the quarters of the Count\r\nof Charolais, and killed a few of his people before his very door.  But\r\nLouis did not care to risk a battle.  He was much impressed by the\r\nenemy’s strength, and by the weakness of which glimpses had been seen in\r\nParis during his absence.  Whilst his men-of-war were fighting here and\r\nthere, he opened negotiations.  Local and temporary truces were accepted,\r\nand agents of the king had conferences with others from the chiefs of the\r\nLeague.  The princes showed so exacting a spirit that there was no\r\ntreating on such conditions; and Louis determined to see whether he could\r\nnot succeed better than his agents.  He had an interview of two hours’\r\nduration in front of the St.  Anthony gate, with the Count of St. Poi, a\r\nconfidant of the Count of Charolais.  On his return he found before the\r\ngate some burgesses waiting for news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XI. and Burgesses waiting for News----193]\r\n\r\n“Well, my friends,” said he, “the Burgundians will not give you so much\r\ntrouble any more as they have given you in the past.”  “That is all very\r\nwell, sir,” replied an attorney of the Chatelet, “but meanwhile they eat\r\nour grapes and gather our vintage without any hinderance.”  “Still,” said\r\nthe king, “that is better than if they were to come and drink your wine\r\nin your cellars.”  The month of September passed thus in parleys without\r\nresult.  Bad news came from Rouen; the League had a party in that city.\r\nLouis felt that the Count of Charolais was the real head of the\r\nopposition, and the only one with whom anything definite could he arrived\r\nat.  He resolved to make a direct attempt upon him; for he had confidence\r\nin the influence he could obtain over people when he chatted and treated\r\nin person with them.  One day he got aboard of a little boat with five of\r\nhis officers, and went over to the left bank of the Seine.  There the\r\nCount of Charolais was awaiting him.  “Will you insure me, brother?” said\r\nthe king, as he stepped ashore.  “Yes, my lord, as a brother,” said the\r\ncount.  The king embraced him and went on; “I quite see, brother, that\r\nyou are a gentleman and of the house of France.”  “How so, my lord?”\r\n “When I sent my ambassadors lately [in 1464] to Lille on an errand to my\r\nuncle, your father and yourself, and when my chancellor, that fool of a\r\nMorvilliers, made you such a fine speech, you sent me word by the\r\nArchbishop of Narbonne that I should repent me of the words spoken to you\r\nby that Morvilliers, and that before a year was over.  Piques-Dieu,\r\nyou’ve kept your promise, and before the end of the year has come.  I\r\nlike to have to do with folks who hold to what they promise.”  This he\r\nsaid laughingly, knowing well that this language was just the sort of\r\nflattery to touch the Count of Charolais.  They walked for a long while\r\ntogether on the river’s bank, to the great curiosity of their people, who\r\nwere surprised to see them conversing on such good terms.  They talked of\r\npossible conditions of peace, both of them displaying considerable\r\npliancy, save the king touching the duchy of Normandy, which he would not\r\nat any price, he said, confer on his brother the Duke of Berry, and the\r\nCount of Charolais touching his enmity towards the house of Croy, with\r\nwhich he was determined not to be reconciled.  At parting, the king\r\ninvited the count to Paris, where he would make him great cheer.  “My\r\nlord,” said Charles, “I have made a vow not to enter any good town until\r\nmy return.”  The king smiled; gave fifty golden crowns for distribution,\r\nto drink his health, amongst the count’s archers, and once more got\r\naboard of his boat.  Shortly after getting back to Paris he learned that\r\nNormandy was lost to him.  The widow of the seneschal, De Breze, lately\r\nkilled at Montlhery, forgetful of all the king’s kindnesses and against\r\nthe will of her own son, whom Louis had appointed seneschal of Normandy\r\nafter his father’s death, had just handed over Rouen to the Duke of\r\nBourbon, one of the most determined chiefs of the League.  Louis at once\r\ntook his course.  He sent to demand an interview with the Count of\r\nCharolais, and repaired to Conflans with a hundred Scots of his guard.\r\nThere was a second edition of the walk together.  Charles knew nothing as\r\nyet about the surrender of Rouen; and Louis lost no time in telling him\r\nof it before he had leisure for reflection and for magnifying his\r\npretensions.  “Since the Normans,” said he, “have of themselves felt\r\ndisposed for such a novelty, so be it!  I should never of my own free\r\nwill have conferred such an appanage on my brother; but, as the thing is\r\ndone, I give my consent.”  And he at the same time assented to all the\r\nother conditions which had formed the subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the resignation displayed by the king was the joy of the\r\nCount of Charolais at seeing himself so near to peace.  Everything was\r\ngoing wrong with his army; provisions were short; murmurs and dissensions\r\nwere setting in; and the League of common weal was on the point of ending\r\nin a shameful catastrophe.  Whilst strolling and conversing with\r\ncordiality the two princes kept advancing towards Paris.  Without\r\nnoticing it, they passed within the entrance of a strong palisade which\r\nthe king had caused to be erected in front of the city-walls, and which\r\nmarked the boundary-line.  All on a sudden they stopped, both of them\r\ndisconcerted.  The Burgundian found himself within the hostile camp; but\r\nhe kept a good countenance, and simply continued the conversation.\r\nAmongst his army, however, when he was observed to be away so long, there\r\nwas already a feeling of deep anxiety.  The chieftains had met together.\r\n“If this young prince,” said the marshal of Burgundy, “has gone to his\r\nown ruin like a fool, let us not ruin his house.  Let every man retire to\r\nhis quarters, and hold himself in readiness without disturbing himself\r\nabout what may happen.  By keeping together we are in a condition to fall\r\nback on the marches of Hainault, Picardy, or Burgundy.”  The veteran\r\nwarrior mounted his horse and rode forward in the direction of Paris to\r\nsee whether Count Charles were coming back or not.  It was not long\r\nbefore he saw a troop of forty or fifty horse moving towards him.  They\r\nwere the Burgundian prince and an escort of the king’s own guard.\r\nCharles dismissed the escort, and came up to the marshal, saying, “Don’t\r\nsay a word; I acknowledge my folly; but I saw it too late; I was already\r\nclose to the works.”  “Everybody can see that I was not there,” said the\r\nmarshal; “if I had been, it would never have happened.  You know, your\r\nhighness, that I am only on loan to you, as long as your father lives.”\r\n Charles made no reply, and returned to his own camp, where all\r\ncongratulated him and rendered homage to the king’s honorable conduct.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for peace were opened forthwith.  There was no difficulty\r\nabout them.  Louis was ready to make sacrifices as soon as be recognized\r\nthe necessity for them, being quite determined, however, in his heart to\r\nrecall them as soon as fortune came back to him.  Two distinct treaties\r\nwere concluded: one at Conflans on the 5th of October, 1465, between\r\nLouis and the Count of Charolais; and the other at St.  Maur on the 29th\r\nof October, between Louis and the other princes of the League.  By one or\r\nthe other of the treaties the king granted nearly every demand that had\r\nbeen made upon him; to the Count of Charolais he gave up all the towns of\r\nimportance in Picardy; to the Duke of Berry he gave the duchy of\r\nNormandy, with entire sovereignty; and the other princes, independently\r\nof the different territories that had been conceded to them, all received\r\nlarge sums in ready money.  The conditions of peace had already been\r\nagreed to, when the Burgundians went so far as to summon, into the\r\nbargain, the strong place of Beauvais.  Louis quietly complained to\r\nCharles: “If you wanted this town,” said he, “you should have asked me\r\nfor it, and I would have given it to you; but peace is made, and it ought\r\nto be observed.”  Charles openly disavowed the deed.  When peace was\r\nproclaimed, on the 30th of October, the king went to Vincennes to receive\r\nthe homage of his brother Charles for the duchy of Normandy, and that of\r\nthe Count of Charolais for the lands of Picardy.  The count asked the\r\nking to give up to him “for that day the castle of Vincennes for the\r\nsecurity of all.”  Louis made no objection; and the gate and apartments\r\nof the castle were guarded by the count’s own people.  But the Parisians,\r\nwhose favor Louis had won, were alarmed on his account.  Twenty-two\r\nthousand men of the city militia marched towards the outskirts of\r\nVincennes and obliged the king to return and sleep at Paris.  He went\r\nalmost alone to the grand review which the Count of Charolais held of his\r\narmy before giving the word for marching away, and passed from rank to\r\nrank speaking graciously to his late enemies.  The king and the count, on\r\nseparating, embraced one another, the count saying in a loud voice,\r\n“Gentlemen, you and I are at the command of the king my sovereign lord,\r\nwho is here present, to serve him whensoever there shall be need.”\r\n\r\nWhen the treaties of Conflans and St. Maur were put before the parliament\r\nto be registered, the parliament at first refused, and the exchequer-\r\nchamber followed suit; but the king insisted in the name of necessity,\r\nand the registration took place, subject to a declaration on the part of\r\nthe parliament that it was forced to obey.  Louis, at bottom, was not\r\nsorry for this resistance, and himself made a secret protest against the\r\ntreaties he had just signed.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the negotiations it had been agreed that thirty-six\r\nnotables, twelve prelates, twelve knights, and twelve members of the\r\ncouncil, should assemble to inquire into the errors committed in the\r\ngovernment of the kingdom, and to apply remedies.  They were to meet on\r\nthe 15th of December, and to have terminated their labors in two months\r\nat the least, and in three months and ten days at the most.  The king\r\npromised on his word to abide firmly and stably by what they should\r\ndecree.  But this commission was nearly a year behind time in assembling,\r\nand, even when it was assembled, its labors were so slow and so futile,\r\nthat the Count de Dampmartin was quite justified in writing to the Count\r\nof Charolais, become by his father’s death Duke of Burgundy, “The League\r\nof common weal has become nothing but the League of common woe.”\r\n\r\nScarcely were the treaties signed and the princes returned each to his\r\nown dominions when a quarrel arose between the Duke of Brittany and the\r\nnew Duke of Normandy.  Louis, who was watching for dissensions between\r\nhis enemies, went at once to see the Duke of Brittany, and made with him\r\na private convention for mutual security.  Then, having his movements\r\nfree, he suddenly entered Normandy to retake possession of it as a\r\nprovince which, notwithstanding the cession of it just made to his\r\nbrother, the King of France could not dispense with.  Evreux, Gisors,\r\nGournay, Louviers, and even Rouen fell, without much resistance, again\r\ninto his power.  The Duke of Berry made a vigorous appeal for support to\r\nhis late ally, the Duke of Burgundy, in order to remain master of the new\r\nduchy which had been conferred upon him under the late treaties.  The\r\nCount of Charolais was at that time taking up little by little the\r\ngovernment of the Burgundian dominions in the name of his father, the\r\naged Duke Philip, who was ill and near his end; but, by pleading his own\r\nengagements, and especially his ever-renewed struggle with his Flemish\r\nsubjects, the Liegese, the count escaped from the necessity of satisfying\r\nthe Duke of Berry.\r\n\r\nIn order to be safe in the direction of Burgundy as well as that of\r\nBrittany, Louis had entered into negotiations with Edward IV., King of\r\nEngland, and had made him offers, perhaps even promises, which seemed to\r\ntrench upon the rights ceded by the treaty of Conflans to the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, as to certain districts of Picardy.  The Count of Charolais was\r\ninformed of it; and in his impetuous wrath he wrote to King Louis,\r\ndubbing him simply Sir, instead of giving him, according to the usage\r\nbetween vassal and suzerain, the title of My most dread lord, “May it\r\nplease you to wit, that some time ago I was apprised of a matter at which\r\nI cannot be too much astounded.  It is with great sorrow that I name it\r\nto you, when I remember the fair expressions I have all through this year\r\nhad from you, both in writing and by word of mouth.  It is certain that\r\nparley has been held between your people and those of the King of\r\nEngland, that you have thought proper to assign to them the district of\r\nCaux and the city of Rouen; that you have promised to obtain from them\r\nAbbeville and the count-ship of Ponthieu, and that you have concluded\r\nwith them certain alliances against me and my country, whilst making them\r\nlarge offers to my prejudice.  Of what is yours, sir, you may dispose\r\naccording to your pleasure; but it seems to me that you might do better\r\nthan wish to take from my hands what is mine, in order to give it to the\r\nEnglish or to any other foreign nation.  I pray you, therefore, sir, if\r\nsuch overtures have been made by your people, to be pleased not to\r\nconsent thereto in any way, but to put a stop to the whole, to the end\r\nthat I may remain your most humble servant, as I desire to be.”\r\n\r\nLouis returned no answer to this letter.  He contented him-self with\r\nsending to the commission of thirty-six notables, then in session at\r\nEtampes for the purpose of considering the reform of the kingdom, a\r\nrequest to represent to the Count of Charolais the impropriety of such\r\nlanguage, and to appeal for the punishment of the persons who had\r\nsuggested it to him.  The count made some awkward excuses, at the same\r\ntime that he persisted in complaining of the king’s obstinate pretensions\r\nand underhand ways.  A serious incident now happened, which for a while\r\ndistracted the attention of the two rivals from their mutual\r\nrecriminations.  Duke Philip the Good, who had for some time past been\r\nvisibly declining in body and mind, was visited at Bruges by a stroke of\r\napoplexy, soon discovered to be fatal.  His son, the Count of Charolais,\r\nwas at Ghent.  At the first whisper of danger he mounted his horse, and\r\nwithout a moment’s halt arrived at Bruges on the 15th of June, 1467, and\r\nran to his father’s room, who had already lost speech and consciousness.\r\n“Father, father,” cried the count, on his knees and sobbing, “give me\r\nyour blessing; and if I have offended you, forgive me.”  “My lord,” added\r\nthe Bishop of Bethlehem, the dying man’s confessor, “if you only hear us,\r\nbear witness by some sign.”  The duke turned his eyes a little towards\r\nhis son, and seemed to feebly press his hand.  This was his last effort\r\nof life; and in the evening, after some hours of passive agony, he died.\r\nHis son flung himself upon the bed: “He shrieked, he wept, he wrung his\r\nhands,” says George Chatelain, one of the aged duke’s oldest and most\r\ntrusted servants, “and for many a long day tears were mingled with all\r\nhis words every time he spoke to those who had been in the service of the\r\ndead, so much so that every one marvelled at his immeasurable grief; it\r\nhad never heretofore been thought that he could feel a quarter of the\r\nsorrow he showed, for he was thought to have a sterner heart, whatever\r\ncause there might have been; but nature overcame him.”  Nor was it to his\r\nson alone that Duke Philip had been so good and left so many grounds for\r\nsorrow.  “With you we lose,” was the saying amongst the crowd that\r\nfollowed the procession through the streets, “with you we lose our good\r\nold duke, the best, the gentlest, the friendliest of princes, our peace\r\nand eke our joy!  Amidst such fearful storms you at last brought us out\r\ninto tranquillity and good order; you set justice on her seat and gave\r\nfree course to commerce.  And now you are dead, and we are orphans!”\r\n Many voices, it is said, added in a lower tone, “You leave us in hands\r\nwhereof the weight is unknown to us; we know not into what perils we may\r\nbe brought by the power that is to be over us, over us so accustomed to\r\nyours, under which we, most of us, were born and grew up.”\r\n\r\nWhat the people were anxiously forecasting, Louis foresaw with certainty,\r\nand took his measures accordingly.  A few days after the death of Philip\r\nthe Good, several of the principal Flemish cities, Ghent first and then\r\nLiege, rose against the new Duke of Burgundy in defence of their\r\nliberties, already ignored or threatened.  The intrigues of Louis were\r\nnot unconnected with these solicitations.  He would undoubtedly have been\r\nvery glad to have seen his most formidable enemy beset, at the very\r\ncommencement of his ducal reign, by serious embarrassments, and obliged\r\nto let the king of France settle without trouble his differences with his\r\nbrother Duke Charles of Berry, and with the Duke of Brittany.  But the\r\nnew Duke of Burgundy was speedily triumphant over the Flemish\r\ninsurrections; and after these successes, at the close of the year 1467,\r\nhe was so powerful and so unfettered in his movements, that Louis might,\r\nwith good reason, fear the formation of a fresh league amongst his great\r\nneighbors in coalition against him, and perhaps even in communication\r\nwith the English, who were ever ready to seek in France allies for the\r\nfurtherance of their attempts to regain there the fortunes wrested from\r\nthem by Joan of Arc and Charles VII.  In view of such a position Louis\r\nformed a resolution, unpalatable, no doubt, to one so jealous of his own\r\npower, but indicative of intelligence and boldness; he confronted the\r\ndifficulties of home government in order to prevent perils from without.\r\nThe remembrance had not yet faded of the energy displayed and the\r\nservices rendered in the first part of Charles VII.’s reign by the\r\nstates-general; a wish was manifested for their resuscitation; and they\r\nwere spoken of, even in the popular doggerel, as the most effectual\r\nremedy for the evils of the period.\r\n\r\n“But what says Paris?”--“She is deaf and dumb.”\r\n\r\n“Dares she not speak?”--“Nor she, nor parliament.”\r\n\r\n“The clergy?”--“O! the clergy are kept mum.”\r\n\r\n“Upon your oath?”--“Yes, on the sacrament.”\r\n\r\n“The nobles, then?”--“The nobles are still worse.”\r\n\r\n“And justice?”--“Hath nor balances nor weights.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, may hope to mitigate this curse?”\r\n\r\n“Who? prithee, who?”--“Why, France’s three estates.”\r\n\r\n“Be pleased, O prince, to grant alleviation .  .  .”\r\n\r\n“To whom?”--“To the good citizen who waits .  .  .”\r\n\r\n“For what?”--“The right of governing the nation .  .  .”\r\n\r\n“Through whom? pray, whom?”--“Why, France’s three estates.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of the evil Louis felt no fear of the remedy.  He summoned\r\nthe states-general to a meeting at Tours on the 1st of April, 1468.\r\nTwenty-eight lords in person, besides representatives of several others\r\nwho were unable to be there themselves, and a hundred and ninety-two\r\ndeputies elected by sixty-four towns, met in session.  The chancellor,\r\nJuvenal des Ursins, explained, in presence of the king, the object of the\r\nmeeting: “It is to take cognizance of the differences which have arisen\r\nbetween the king and Sir Charles, his brother, in respect of the duchy of\r\nNormandy and the appanage of the said Sir Charles; likewise the great\r\nexcesses and encroachments which the Duke of Brittany hath committed\r\nagainst the king by seizing his places and subjects, and making open war\r\nupon him; and thirdly, the communication which is said to be kept up by\r\nthe Duke of Brittany with the English, in order to bring them down upon\r\nthis country, and hand over to them the places he doth hold in Normandy.\r\nWhereupon we are of opinion that the people of the three estates should\r\ngive their good advice and council.”  After this official programme, the\r\nking and his councillors withdrew.  The estates deliberated during seven\r\nor eight sessions, and came to an agreement “without any opposition or\r\ndifficulty whatever, that as touching the duchy of Normandy it ought not\r\nto and cannot be separated from the crown in any way whatsoever, but must\r\nremain united, annexed, and conjoined thereto inseparably.  Further, any\r\narrangement of the Duke of Brittany with the English is a thing damnable,\r\npernicious, and of most evil consequences, and one which is not to be\r\npermitted, suffered, or tolerated in any way.  Lastly, if Sir Charles,\r\nthe Duke of Brittany, or others, did make war on the king our sovereign\r\nlord, or have any treaty or connection with his enemies, the king is\r\nbound to proceed against them who should do so, according to what must be\r\ndone in such case for the tranquillity and security of the realm\r\n.  .  .  .  And as often soever as the said cases may occur, the people\r\nof the estates have agreed and consented, do agree and consent, that,\r\nwithout waiting for other assemblage or congregation of the estates, the\r\nking have power to do all that comports with order and justice; the said\r\nestates promising and agreeing to serve and aid the king touching these\r\nmatters, to obey him with all their might, and to live and die with him\r\nin this quarrel.”\r\n\r\nLouis XI. himself could demand no more.  Had they been more experienced\r\nand far-sighted, the states-general of 1468 would not have been disposed\r\nto resign, even temporarily, into the hands of the kingship, their rights\r\nand their part in the government of the country; but they showed\r\npatriotism and good sense in defending the integrity of the kingdom,\r\nnational unity, and public order against the selfish ambition and\r\ndisorderly violence of feudalism.\r\n\r\nFortified by their burst of attachment, Louis, by the treaty of Ancenis,\r\nsigned on the 10th of September, 1468, put an end to his differences with\r\nFrancis II., Duke of Brittany, who gave up his alliance with the house of\r\nBurgundy, and undertook to prevail upon Duke Charles of France to accept\r\nan arbitration for the purpose of settling, before two years were over,\r\nthe question of his territorial appanage in the place of Normandy.  In\r\nthe meanwhile a pension of sixty thousand livres was to be paid by the\r\ncrown to that prince.  Thus Louis was left with the new duke, Charles of\r\nBurgundy, as the only adversary he had to face.  His advisers were\r\ndivided as to the course to be taken with this formidable vassal.  Was he\r\nto be dealt with by war or by negotiation?  Count de Dampmartin, Marshal\r\nde Rouault, and nearly all the military men earnestly advised war.\r\n“Leave it to us,” they said: “we will give the king a good account of\r\nthis Duke of Burgundy.  Plague upon it! what do these Burgundians mean?\r\nThey have called in the English and made alliance with them in order to\r\ngive us battle; they have handed over the country to fire and sword; they\r\nhave driven the king from his lordship.  We have suffered too much; we\r\nmust have revenge; down upon them, in the name of the devil, down upon\r\nthem.  The king makes a sheep of himself and bargains for his wool and\r\nhis skin, as if he had not wherewithal to defend himself.  ‘Sdeath! if\r\nwe were in his place, we would rather risk the whole kingdom than let\r\nourselves be treated in this fashion.”  But the king did not like to risk\r\nthe kingdom; and he had more confidence in negotiation than in war.  Two\r\nof his principal advisers, the constable De St. Pol and the cardinal De\r\nla Balue, Bishop of Evreux, were of his opinion, and urged him to the top\r\nof his bent.  Of them he especially made use in his more or less secret\r\nrelations with the Duke of Burgundy; and he charged them to sound him\r\nwith respect to a personal interview between himself and the duke.  It\r\nhas been very well remarked by M. de Barante, in his _Histoire des Dues\r\nde Bourgogne,_ that “Louis had a great idea of the influence he gained\r\nover people by his wits and his language; he was always convinced that\r\npeople never said what ought to be said, and that they did not set to\r\nwork the right way.”  It was a certain way of pleasing him to give him\r\npromise of a success which he would owe to himself alone; and the\r\nconstable and the cardinal did not fail to do so.  They found the Duke of\r\nBurgundy very little disposed to accept the king’s overtures.  “By St.\r\nGeorge,” said he, “I ask nothing but what is just and reasonable; I\r\ndesire the fulfilment of the treaties of Arras and of Conflans to which\r\nthe king has sworn.  I make no war on him; it is he who is coming to make\r\nit on me; but should he bring all the forces of his kingdom I will not\r\nbudge from here or recoil the length of my foot.  My predecessors have\r\nseen themselves in worse plight, and have not been dismayed.”  Neither\r\nthe constable De St. Pol nor the cardinal De la Balue said anything to\r\nthe king about this rough disposition on the part of Duke Charles; they\r\nboth in their own personal interest desired the interview, and did not\r\ncare to bring to light anything that might be an obstacle to it.  Louis\r\npersisted in his desire, and sent to ask the duke for a letter of\r\nsafe-conduct.  Charles wrote with his own hand, on the 8th of October,\r\n1468, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     “My lord, if it is your pleasure to come to this town of Peronne for\r\n     to see us, I swear to you and promise you, by my faith and on my\r\n     honor, that you may come, remain, sojourn, and go back safely to the\r\n     places of Chauny and Noy on, at your pleasure, as many times as it\r\n     may please you, freely and frankly, without any hinderance to you or\r\n     to any of your folks from me or others in any case whatever and\r\n     whatsoever may happen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles the Rash----203]\r\n\r\nWhen this letter arrived at Noyon, extreme surprise and alarm were\r\ndisplayed about Louis; the interview appeared to be a mad idea; the\r\nvicegerent (vidam) of Amiens came hurrying up with a countryman who\r\ndeclared on his life that mylord of Burgundy wished for it only to make\r\nan attempt upon the king’s person; the king’s greatest enemies, it was\r\nsaid, were already, or soon would be, with the duke; and the captains\r\nvehemently reiterated their objections.  But Louis held to his purpose,\r\nand started for Noyon on the 2d of October, taking with him the\r\nconstable, the cardinal, his confessor, and, for all his escort,\r\nfourscore of his faithful Scots, and sixty men-at-arms.  This knowing\r\ngossip, as his contemporaries called him, had fits of rashness and\r\naudacious vanity.\r\n\r\nDuke Charles went to meet him outside the town.  They embraced one\r\nanother, and returned on foot to Peronne, chatting familiarly, and the\r\nking with his hand resting on the duke’s shoulder, in token of amity.\r\nLouis had quarters at the house of the chamberlain of the town; the\r\ncastle of Peronne being, it was said, in too bad a state, and too ill\r\nfurnished, for his reception.  On the very day that the king entered\r\nPeronne, the duke’s army, commanded by the Marshal of Burgundy, arrived\r\nfrom the opposite side, and encamped beneath the walls.  Several former\r\nservants of the king, now not on good terms with him, accompanied the\r\nBurgundian army.  “As soon as the king was apprised of the arrival of\r\nthese folks,” says Commynes, “he had a great fright, and sent to beg of\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy that he might be lodged at the castle, seeing that\r\nall those who had come were evil disposed towards him.  The duke was very\r\nmuch rejoiced thereat, had him lodged there, and stoutly assured him that\r\nhe had no cause for doubt.”  Next day parleys began between the\r\ncouncillors of the two princes.  They did not appear much disposed to\r\ncome to an understanding, and a little sourness of spirit was beginning\r\nto show itself on both sides, when there came news which excited a grand\r\ncommotion.  “King Louis, on coming to Peronne, had not considered,” says\r\nCommynes, “that he had sent two ambassadors to the folks of Liege to\r\nexcite them against the duke.  Nevertheless, the said ambassadors had\r\nadvanced matters so well that they had already made a great mass (of\r\nrebels).  The Liegese came and took by surprise the town of Tongres,\r\nwherein were the Bishop of Liege and the Lord of Humbercourt, whom they\r\ntook also, slaying, moreover, some servants of the said bishop.”  The\r\nfugitives who reported this news at Peronne made the matter a great deal\r\nworse than it was; they had no doubt, they said, but that the bishop and\r\nSire d’Humbercourt had also been murdered; and Charles had no more doubt\r\nabout it than they.  His fury was extreme; he strode to and fro,\r\neverywhere relating the news from Liege.  “So the king,” said he, “came\r\nhere only to deceive me; it is he who, by his ambassadors, excited these\r\nbad folks of Liege; but, by St. George, they shall be severely punished\r\nfor it, and he, himself, shall have cause to repent.”  He gave immediate\r\norders to have the gates of the town and of the castle closed and guarded\r\nby the archers; but being a little troubled, nevertheless, as to the\r\neffect which would be produced by this order, he gave as his reason for\r\nit that he was quite determined to have recovered a box full of gold and\r\njewels which had been stolen from him.  “I verily believe,” says\r\nCommynes, “that if just then the duke had found those whom he addressed\r\nready to encourage him, or advise him to do the king a bad turn, he would\r\nhave done it; but at that time I was still with the said duke; I served\r\nhim as chamberlain, and I slept in his room when I pleased, for such was\r\nthe usage of that house.  With me was there none at this speech of the\r\nduke’s, save two grooms of the chamber, one called Charles de Visen, a\r\nnative of Dijon, an honest man, and one who had great credit with his\r\nmaster; and we exasperated nought, but assuaged according to our power.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Duke Charles was thus abandoning himself to the first outburst of\r\nhis wrath, King Louis remained impassive in the castle of Peronne, quite\r\nclose to the great tower, wherein, about the year 925, King Charles the\r\nSimple had been confined by Herbert, Count of Vermandois, and died a\r\nprisoner in 929.  None of Louis’s people had been removed from him; but\r\nthe gate of the castle was strictly guarded.  There was no entering.\r\non his service, but by the wicket, and none of the duke’s people came to\r\nvisit him; he had no occasion to parley, explain himself, and guess what\r\nit was expedient for him to say or do; he was alone, wrestling with his\r\nimagination and his lively impressions, with the feeling upon him of the\r\nrecent mistakes he had committed, especially in exciting the Liegese to\r\nrebellion, and forgetting the fact just when he was coming to place\r\nhimself in his enemy’s hands.  Far, however, from losing his head, Louis\r\ndisplayed in this perilous trial all the penetration, activity, and\r\nshrewdness of his mind, together with all the suppleness of his\r\ncharacter; he sent by his own servants questions, offers, and promises to\r\nall the duke’s servants from whom he could hope for any help or any good\r\nadvice.  Fifteen thousand golden crowns, with which he had provided\r\nhimself at starting, were given by him to be distributed amongst the\r\nhousehold of the Duke of Burgundy; a liberality which was perhaps\r\nuseless, since it is said that he to whom he had intrusted the sum kept a\r\ngood portion of it for himself.  The king passed two days in this state\r\nof gloomy expectancy as to what was in preparation against him.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of October, Duke Charles, having cooled down a little,\r\nassembled his council.  The sitting lasted all the day and part of the\r\nnight.  Louis had sent to make an offer to swear a peace, such as, at the\r\nmoment of his arrival, had been proposed to him, without any reservation\r\nor difficulty on his part.  He engaged to join the duke in making war\r\nupon the Liegese and chastising them for their rebellion.  He would leave\r\nas hostages his nearest relatives and his most intimate advisers.  At the\r\nbeginning of the council his proposals were not even listened to; there\r\nwas no talk but of keeping the king a prisoner, and sending after his\r\nbrother, the Prince Charles, with whom the entire government of the\r\nkingdom should be arranged; the messenger had orders to be in readiness\r\nto start at once; his horse was in the court-yard; he was only waiting\r\nfor the letters which the duke was writing to Brittany.  The chancellor\r\nof Burgundy and some of the wiser councillors besought the duke to\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\nThe king had come to Peronne on the faith of his safe-conduct; it would\r\nbe an eternal dishonor for the house of Burgundy if he broke his word to\r\nhis sovereign lord; and the conditions which the king was prepared to\r\ngrant would put an end, with advantage to Burgundy, to serious and\r\ndifficult business.  The duke gave heed to these honest and prudent\r\ncounsels; the news from Liege turned out to be less serious than the\r\nfirst rumors had represented; the bishop and Sire d’Humbercourt had been\r\nset at liberty.  Charles retired to his chamber; and there, without\r\nthinking of undressing, he walked to and fro with long strides, threw\r\nhimself upon his bed, got up again, and soliloquized out loud, addressing\r\nhimself occasionally to Commynes, who lay close by him.  Towards morning,\r\nthough he still showed signs of irritation, his language was less\r\nthreatening.  “He has promised me,” said he, “to come with me to\r\nreinstate the Bishop of Liege, who is my brother-in-law, and a relation\r\nof his also; he shall certainly come; I shall not scruple to hold him to\r\nhis word that he gave me;” and he at once sent Sires de Crequi, de\r\nCharni, and de la Roche to tell the king that he was about to come and\r\nswear peace with him.  Commynes had only just time to tell Louis in what\r\nframe of mind the duke was, and in what danger he would place himself, if\r\nhe hesitated either to swear peace or to march against the Liegese.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was broad day, the duke entered the apartment of the castle\r\nwhere the king was a prisoner.  His look was courteous, but his voice\r\ntrembled with choler; his words were short and bitter, his manner was\r\nthreatening.  A little troubled at his aspect, Louis said, “Brother, I am\r\nsafe, am I not, in your house and your country?”  “Yes, sir,” answered\r\nthe duke, “so safe that if I saw an arrow from a bow coming towards you I\r\nwould throw myself in the way to protect you.  But will you not be\r\npleased to swear the treaty just as it is written?”  “Yes,” said the\r\nking, “and I thank you for your good will.”  “And will you not be pleased\r\nto come with me to Liege, to help me punish the treason committed against\r\nme by these Lidgese, all through you and your journey hither?  The bishop\r\nis your near relative, of the house of Bourbon.”  “Yes, Padues-Dieu,”\r\n replied Louis, “and I am much astounded at their wickedness.  But begin\r\nwe by swearing this treaty; and then I will start, with as many or as few\r\nof my people as you please.”\r\n\r\nForthwith was taken out from the king’s boxes the wood of the so-called\r\ntrue cross, which was named the cross of St. Laud, because it had been\r\npreserved in the church of St. Laud, at Angers.  It was supposed to have\r\nformerly belonged to Charlemagne; and it was the relic which Louis\r\nregarded as the most sacred.  The treaty was immediately signed, without\r\nany change being made in that of Conflans.  The Duke of Burgundy merely\r\nengaged to use his influence with Prince Charles of France to induce him\r\nto be content with Brie and Champagne as appanage.  The storm was\r\nweathered; and Louis almost rejoiced at seeing himself called upon to\r\nchastise in person the Liegese, who had made him commit such a mistake\r\nand run such a risk.\r\n\r\nNext day the two princes set out together, Charles with his army, and\r\nLouis with his modest train increased by three hundred men-at-arms, whom\r\nhe had sent for from France.  On the 27th of October they arrived before\r\nLiege.  Since Duke Charles’s late victories, the city had no longer any\r\nramparts or ditches; nothing seemed easier than to get into it; but the\r\nbesieged could not persuade themselves that Louis was sincerely allied\r\nwith the Duke of Burgundy, and they made a sortie, shouting, “Hurrah for\r\nthe king!  Hurrah for France!”  Great was their surprise when they saw\r\nLouis advancing in person, wearing in his hat the cross of St. Andrew of\r\nBurgundy, and shouting, “Hurrah for Burgundy!” Some even amongst the\r\nFrench who surrounded the king were shocked; they could not reconcile\r\nthemselves to so little pride and such brazen falsehood.  Louis took no\r\nheed of their temper, and never ceased to repeat, “When pride rides\r\nbefore, shame and hurt follow close after.”  The surprise of the Liegese\r\nwas transformed into indignation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XI. and Charles the Rash at Peronne----209]\r\n\r\nThey made a more energetic and a longer resistance than had been\r\nexpected.  The besiegers, confident in their strength, kept careless\r\nwatch, and the sorties of the besieged became more numerous.  One night\r\nCharles received notice that his men had just been attacked in a suburb\r\nwhich they had held, and were flying.  He mounted his horse, gave orders\r\nnot to awake the king, repaired by himself to the place where the fight\r\nwas, put everything to rights, and came back and told the whole affair to\r\nLouis, who exhibited great joy.  Another time, one dark and rainy night,\r\nthere was an alarm, about midnight, of a general attack upon the whole\r\nBurgundian camp.  The duke was soon up, and a moment afterwards the king\r\narrived.  There was great disorder.  “The Liegese sallied by this gate,”\r\n said some; “No,” said others, “it was by that gate!” there was nothing\r\nknown for certain, and there were no orders given.  Charles was impetuous\r\nand brave, but he was easily disconcerted, and his servants were somewhat\r\nvexed not to see him putting a better countenance on things before the\r\nking.  Louis, on the other hand, was cool and calm, giving commands\r\nfirmly, and ready to assume responsibility wherever he happened to be.\r\n“Take what men you have,” said he to the constable St. Poi, who was at\r\nhis side, “and go in this direction; if they are really coming upon us,\r\nthey will pass that way.”  It was discovered to be a false alarm.  Two\r\ndays afterwards there was a more serious affair.  The inhabitants of a\r\ncanton which was close to the city, and was called Franchemont, resolved\r\nto make a desperate effort, and go and fall suddenly upon the very spot\r\nwhere the two princes were quartered.  One night, about ten P.  M., six\r\nhundred men sallied out by one of the breaches, all men of stout hearts\r\nand well armed.  The duke’s quarters were first attacked.  Only twelve\r\narchers were on guard below, and they were playing at dice.  Charles was\r\nin bed.  Commynes put on him, as quickly as possible, his breastplate and\r\nhelmet, and they went down stairs.  The archers were with great\r\ndifficulty defending the doorway, but help arrived, and the danger was\r\nover.  The quarters of King Louis had also been attacked; but at the\r\nfirst sound the Scottish archers had hurried up, surrounded their master,\r\nand repulsed the attack, without caring whether their arrows killed\r\nLiegese or such Burgundians as had come up with assistance.  The gallant\r\nfellows from Franchemont fell, almost to a man.  The duke and his\r\nprincipal captains held a council the next day; and the duke was for\r\ndelivering the assault.  The king was not present at this council, and\r\nwhen he was informed of the resolution taken he was not in favor of an\r\nassault.  “You see,” said he, “the courage of these people; you know how\r\nmurderous and uncertain is street fighting; you will lose many brave men\r\nto no purpose.  Wait two or three days, and the Liegese will infallibly\r\ncome to terms.”  Nearly all the Burgundian captains sided with the king.\r\nThe duke got angry.  “He wishes to spare the Liegese,” said he; “what\r\ndanger is there in this assault?  There are no walls; they can’t put a\r\nsingle gun in position; I certainly will not give up the assault; if the\r\nking is afraid, let him get him gone to Namur.”  Such an insult shocked\r\neven the Burgundians.  Louis was informed of it, but said nothing.  Next\r\nday, the 30th of October, 1468, the assault was ordered; and the duke\r\nmarched at the head of his troops.  Up came the king; but, “Bide,” said\r\nCharles; “put not yourself uselessly in danger; I will send you word when\r\nit is time.”  “Lead on, brother,” replied Louis; “you are the most\r\nfortunate prince alive; I will follow you.”  And he continued marching\r\nwith him.  But the assault was unnecessary.  Discouragement had taken\r\npossession of the Liegese, the bravest of whom had fallen.  It was\r\nSunday, and the people who remained were not expecting an attack; “the\r\ncloth was laid in every house, and all were preparing for dinner.”  The\r\nBurgundians moved forward through the empty streets; and Louis marched\r\nquietly along, surrounded by his own escort, and shouting, “Hurrah for\r\nBurgundy!”  The duke turned back to meet him, and they went together to\r\ngive thanks to God in the cathedral of St.  Lambert.  It was the only\r\nchurch which had escaped from the fury and the pillaging of the\r\nBurgundians; by midday there was nothing left to take in the houses or in\r\nthe churches.  Louis loaded Duke Charles with felicitations and\r\ncommendations: “He knew how to turn them in a fashion so courteous and\r\namiable that the duke was charmed and softened.”  The next day, as they\r\nwere talking together, “Brother,” said the king to the duke, “if you\r\nhave still need of my help, do not spare me; but if you have nothing more\r\nfor me to do, it would be well for me to go back to Paris, to make public\r\nin my court of parliament the arrangement we have come to together;\r\notherwise it would run a risk of becoming of no avail; you know that such\r\nis the custom of France.  Next summer we must meet again; you will come\r\ninto your duchy of Burgundy, and I will go and pay you a visit, and we\r\nwill pass a week joyously together in making good cheer.”  Charles made\r\nno answer, and sent for the treaty lately concluded between them at\r\nPeronne, leaving it to the king’s choice to confirm or to renounce it,\r\nand excusing himself in covert terms for having thus constrained him and\r\nbrought him away.  The king made a show of being satisfied with the\r\ntreaty, and on the 2d of November, 1468, the day but one after the\r\ncapture of Liege, set out for France.  The duke bore him company to\r\nwithin half a league of the city.  As they were taking leave of one\r\nanother, the king said to him, “If, peradventure, my brother Charles, who\r\nis in Brittany, should be discontented with the assignment I make him for\r\nlove of you, what would you have me do?”  “If he do not please to take\r\nit,” answered the duke, “but would have you satisfy him, I leave it to\r\nyou two.”  Louis desired no more: he returned home free and confident in\r\nhimself, “after having passed the most trying three weeks of his life.”\r\n\r\nBut Louis XI.’s deliverance after his quasi-captivity at Peronne, and the\r\nnew treaty he had concluded with Duke Charles, were and could be only a\r\ntemporary break in the struggle between these two princes, destined as\r\nthey were, both by character and position, to irremediable\r\nincompatibility.  They were too powerful and too different to live at\r\npeace when they were such close neighbors, and when their relations were\r\nso complicated.  We find in the chronicle of George Chastelain, a Flemish\r\nburgher, and a servant on familiar terms with Duke Charles, as he had\r\nbeen with his father, Duke Philip, a judicious picture of this\r\nincompatibility and the causes of it.  “There had been,” he says, “at all\r\ntimes a rancor between these two princes, and, whatever pacification\r\nmight have been effected to-day, everything returned to-morrow to the old\r\ncondition, and no real love could be established.  They suffered from\r\nincompatibility of temperament and perpetual discordance of will; and the\r\nmore they advanced in years the deeper they plunged into a state of\r\nserious difference and hopeless bitterness.  The king was a man of\r\nsubtlety and full of fence; he knew how to recoil for a better spring,\r\nhow to affect humility and gentleness in his deep designs, how to yield\r\nand to give up in order to receive double, and how to bear and tolerate\r\nfor a time his own grievances in hopes of being able at last to have his\r\nrevenge.  He was, therefore, very much to be feared for his practical\r\nknowledge, showing the greatest skill and penetration in the world.  Duke\r\nCharles was to be feared for his great courage, which he evinced and\r\ndisplayed in his actions, making no account of king or emperor.  Thus,\r\nwhilst the king had great sense and great ability, which he used with\r\ndissimulation and suppleness in order to succeed in his views, the duke,\r\non his side, had a great sense of another sort and to another purpose,\r\nwhich he displayed by a public ostentation of his pride, without any fear\r\nof putting himself in a false position.”  Between 1468 and 1477, from the\r\nincident at Peronne to the death of Charles at the siege of Nancy, the\r\nhistory of the two princes was nothing but one constant alternation\r\nbetween ruptures and re-adjustments, hostilities and truces, wherein both\r\nwere constantly changing their posture, their language, and their allies.\r\nIt was at one time the affairs of the Duke of Brittany or those of Prince\r\nCharles of France, become Duke of Guienne; at another it was the\r\nrelations with the different claimants to the throne of England, or the\r\nfate of the towns, in Picardy, handed over to the Duke of Burgundy by the\r\ntreaties of Conflans and Peronne, which served as a ground or pretext for\r\nthe frequent recurrences of war.  In 1471 St. Quentin opened its gates to\r\nCount Louis of St. Poi, constable of France; and Duke Charles complained\r\nwith threats about it to the Count of Dampmartin, who was in commend, on\r\nthat frontier, of Louis XI.’s army, and had a good understanding with the\r\nconstable.  Dampmartin, “one of the bravest men of his time,” says Duclos\r\n[Histoire de Louis XI in the (Enures completes of Duclos, t. ii. p. 429),\r\n“sincere and faithful, a warm friend and an implacable foe, at once\r\nreplied to the duke, ‘Most high and puissant prince, I suppose your\r\nletters to have been dictated by your council and highest clerics, who\r\nare folks better at letter-making than I am, for I have not lived by\r\nquill-driving.  .  .  .  If I write you matter that displeases you, and\r\nyou have a desire to revenge yourself upon me, you shall find me so near\r\nto your army that you will know how little fear I have of you.  .  .  .\r\nBe assured that if it be your will to go on long making war upon the\r\nking, it will at last be found out by all the world that as a soldier you\r\nhave mistaken your calling.”  The next year (1472) war broke out.  Duke\r\nCharles went and laid siege to Beauvais, and on the 27th of June\r\ndelivered the first assault.  The inhabitants were at this moment left\r\nalmost alone to defend their town.  A young girl of eighteen, Joan\r\nFourquet, whom a burgher’s wife of Beauvais, Madame Laisne, her mother by\r\nadoption, had bred up in the history, still so recent, of Joan of Arc,\r\nthrew herself into the midst of the throng, holding up her little axe\r\n(hachette) before the image of St. Angadresme, patroness of the town, and\r\ncrying, “O glorious virgin, come to my aid; to arms! to arms!”  The\r\nassault was repulsed; re-enforcements came up from Noyon, Amiens, and\r\nParis, under the orders of the Marshal de Rouault; and the mayor of\r\nBeauvais presented Joan to him.  “Sir,” said the young girl to him, “you\r\nhave everywhere been victor, and you will be so with us.”  On the 9th of\r\nJuly the Duke of Burgundy delivered a second assault, which lasted four\r\nhours.  Some Burgundians had escaladed a part of the ramparts; Joan\r\nHachette arrived there just as one of them was planting his flag on the\r\nspot; she pushed him over the side into the ditch, and went down in\r\npursuit of him; the man fell on one knee; Joan struck him down, took\r\npossession of the flag, and mounted up to the ramparts again, crying,\r\n“Victory!”  The same cry resounded at all points of the wall; the assault\r\nwas everywhere repulsed.  The vexation of Charles was great; the day\r\nbefore he had been almost alone in advocating the assault; in the\r\nevening, as he lay on his camp-bed, according to his custom, he had asked\r\nseveral of his people whether they thought the townsmen were prepared for\r\nit.  “Yes, certainly,” was the answer; “there are a great number of\r\nthem.”  “You will not find a soul there to-morrow,” said Charles with a\r\nsneer.  He remained for twelve days longer before the place, looking for\r\na better chance; but on the 12th of July he decided upon raising the\r\nsiege, and took the road to Normandy.  Some days before attacking\r\nBeauvais, he had taken, not without difficulty, Nesle in the Vermandois.\r\n“There it was,” says Commynes, “that he first committed a horrible and\r\nwicked deed of war, which had never been his wont; this was burning\r\neverything everywhere; those who were taken alive were hanged; a pretty\r\nlarge number had their hands cut off.  It mislikes me to speak of such\r\ncruelty; but I was on the spot, and must needs say something about it.”\r\n Commynes undoubtedly said something about it to Charles himself, who\r\nanswered, “It is the fruit borne by the tree of war; it would have been\r\nthe fate of Beauvais if I could have taken the town.”\r\n\r\nBetween the two rivals in France, relations with England were a subject\r\nof constant manoeuvring and strife.  In spite of reverses on the\r\nContinent and civil wars in their own island, the Kings of England had\r\nnot abandoned their claims to the crown of France; they were still in\r\npossession of Calais; and the memory of the battles of Crecy, Poitiers,\r\nand Agincourt was still a tower of strength to them.  Between 1470 and\r\n1472 the house of York had triumphed over the house of Lancaster; and\r\nEdward IV. was undisputed king.  In his views touching France he found a\r\nnatural ally in the Duke of Burgundy; and it was in concert with Charles\r\nthat Edward was incessantly concocting and attempting plots and campaigns\r\nagainst Louis XI.  In 1474 he, by a herald, called upon Louis to give up\r\nto him Normandy and Guienne, else, he told him, he would cross over to\r\nFrance with his army.  “Tell your master,” answered Louis coolly, “that I\r\nshould not advise him to.”  Next year the herald returned to tell Louis\r\nthat the King of England, on the point of embarking, called upon him to\r\ngive up to him the kingdom of France.  Louis had a conversation with the\r\nherald.  “Your king,” said he, “is undertaking this war against his own\r\ngrain at the solicitation of the Duke of Burgundy; he would do much\r\nbetter to live in peace with me, instead of devoting himself to allies\r\nwho cannot but compromise him without doing him any service;” and he had\r\nthree hundred golden crowns presented to the herald, with a promise of\r\nconsiderably more if peace were made.  The herald, thus won over,\r\npromised, in his turn, to do all he could, saying that he believed that\r\nhis master would lend a willing ear, but that, before mentioning the\r\nsubject, they must wait until Edward had crossed the sea and formed some\r\nidea of the difficulties in the way of his enterprise; and he advised\r\nLouis to establish communications with my lord Howard and my lord\r\nStanley, who had great influence with King Edward.  “Whilst the king was\r\nparleying with the said herald, there were many folks in the hall,” says\r\nCommynes, “who were waiting, and had great longing to know what the king\r\nwas saying to him, and what countenance he would wear when he came from\r\nwithin.  The king, when he had made an end, called me and told me to keep\r\nthe said herald talking, so that none might speak to him, and to have\r\ndelivered unto him a piece of crimson velvet containing thirty ells.  So\r\ndid I, and the king was right joyous at that which he had got out of the\r\nsaid herald.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Philip de Commynes----217]\r\n\r\nIt was now three years since Philip de Commynes had left the Duke of\r\nBurgundy’s service to enter that of Louis XI.  In 1471 Charles had, none\r\nknows why, rashly authorized an interview between Louis and De Commynes.\r\n“The king’s speech,” says the chronicler Molinet, in the Duke of\r\nBurgundy’s service, “was so sweet and full of virtue that it entranced,\r\nsiren-like, all those who gave ear to it.”  “Of all princes,” says\r\nCommynes himself, “he was the one who was at most pains to gain over a\r\nman who was able to serve him, and able to injure him; and he was not put\r\nout at being refused once by one whom he was working to gain over, but\r\ncontinued thereat, making him large promises, and actually giving money\r\nand estate when he made acquaintances that were pleasing to him.”\r\n Commynes spoke according to his own experience.  Louis, from the moment\r\nof making his acquaintance, had guessed his value; and as early as 1468,\r\nin the course of his disagreeable adventure at Peronne, he had found the\r\ngood offices of Commynes of great service to him.  It was probably from\r\nthis very time that he applied himself assiduously to the task of gaining\r\nhim over.  Commynes hesitated a long while; but Louis was even more\r\nperseveringly persistent than Commynes was hesitating.  The king backed\r\nup his handsome offers by substantial and present gifts.  In 1471,\r\naccording to what appears, he lent Commynes six thousand livres of Tours,\r\nwhich the Duke of Burgundy’s councillor lodged with a banker at Tours.\r\nThe next year, the king, seeing that Commynes was still slow to decide,\r\nbade one of his councillors to go to Tours, in his name, and seize at the\r\nbanker’s the six thousand livres intrusted to the latter by Commynes.\r\n“This,” says the learned editor of the last edition of Commynes’\r\nMemoires, “was an able and decisive blow.  The effect of the seizure\r\ncould not but be, and indeed was, to put Commynes in the awkward dilemma\r\nof seeing his practices (as the saying was at that time) divulged without\r\nreaping the fruit of them, or of securing the advantages only by setting\r\naside the scruples which held him back.  He chose the latter course,\r\nwhich had become the safer; and during the night between the 7th and 8th\r\nof August, 1472, he left Burgundy forever.  The king was at that time at\r\nPonts-de-Ce, and there his new servant joined him.”  The very day of his\r\ndeparture, at six A. M., Duke Charles had a seizure made of all the goods\r\nand all the rights belonging to the fugitive; “but what Commynes lost on\r\none side,” says his editor, “he was about to recover a hundred fold on\r\nthe other; scarcely had he arrived at the court of Louis XI. when he\r\nreceived at once the title of councillor and chamberlain to the king;\r\nsoon afterwards a pension of six thousand livres of Tours was secured to\r\nhim, by way of giving him wherewithal to honorably maintain his position;\r\nhe was put into the place of captain of the castle and keep of the town\r\nof Chinon; and lastly, a present was made to him of the rich principality\r\nof Talmont.”  Six months later, in January, 1473, Commynes married Helen\r\nde Chambes, daughter of the lord of Montsoreau, who brought him as dowry\r\ntwenty-seven thousand five hundred livres of Tours, which enabled him to\r\npurchase the castle, town, barony, land, and lordship of Argenton\r\n[arrondissement of Bressuire, department of Deux-Sevres], the title of\r\nwhich he thenceforward assumed.\r\n\r\nHalf a page or so can hardly be thought too much space to devote in a\r\nHistory of France to the task of tracing to their origin the conduct and\r\nfortunes of one of the most eminent French politicians, who, after having\r\ntaken a chief part in the affairs of their country and their epoch, have\r\ndedicated themselves to the work of narrating them in a spirit of liberal\r\nand admirable comprehension both of persons and events.  But we will\r\nreturn to Louis XI.\r\n\r\nThe King of England readily entertained the overtures announced to him by\r\nhis herald.  He had landed at Calais on the 22d of June, 1475, with an\r\narmy of from sixteen to eighteen thousand men thirsting for conquest and\r\npillage in France, and the Duke of Burgundy had promised to go and join\r\nhim with a considerable force; but the latter, after having appeared for\r\na moment at Calais to concert measures with his ally, returned no more,\r\nand even hesitated about admitting the English into his towns of Artois\r\nand Picardy.  Edward waited for him nearly two months at Peronne, but in\r\nvain.  During this time Louis continued his attempts at negotiation.  He\r\nfixed his quarters at Amiens, and Edward came and encamped half a league\r\nfrom the town.  The king sent to him, it is said, three hundred wagons\r\nladen with the best wines he could find, “the which train,” says\r\nCommynes, “was almost an army as big as the English;” at the entrance of\r\nthe gate of Amiens Louis had caused to be set out two large tables\r\n“laden with all sorts of good eatables and good wines; and at each of\r\nthese two tables he had caused to be seated five or six men of good\r\nfamily, stout and fat, to make better sport for them who had a mind to\r\ndrink.  When the English went into the town, wherever they put up they\r\nhad nothing to pay; there were nine or ten taverns, well supplied,\r\nwhither they went to eat and drink, and asked for what they pleased.  And\r\nthis lasted three or four days.”  An agreement was soon come to as to the\r\nterms of peace.  King Edward bound himself to withdraw with his army to\r\nEngland so soon as Louis XI. should have paid him seventy-five thousand\r\ncrowns.  Louis promised besides to pay annually to King Edward fifty\r\nthousand crowns, in two payments, during the time that both princes were\r\nalive.  A truce for seven years was concluded; they made mutual promises\r\nto lend each other aid if they were attacked by their enemies or by their\r\nown subjects in rebellion; and Prince Charles, the eldest son of Louis\r\nXI., was to marry Elizabeth, Edward’s daughter, when both should be of\r\nmarriageable age.  Lastly, Queen Margaret of Anjou, who had been a\r\nprisoner in England since the death of her husband, Henry VI., was to be\r\nset at liberty, and removed to France, on renouncing all claim to the\r\ncrown of England.  These conditions having been formulated, it was agreed\r\nthat the two kings should meet and sign them at Pecquigny, on the Somme,\r\nthree leagues from Amiens.  Thither, accordingly, they repaired, on the\r\n29th of August, 1475.  Edward, as he drew near, doffed “his bonnet of\r\nblack velvet, whereon was a large fleur-de-lis in jewels, and bowed down\r\nto within half a foot of the ground.”  Louis made an equally deep\r\nreverence, saying, “Sir my cousin, right welcome; there is no man in the\r\nworld I could more desire to see than I do you, and praised be God that\r\nwe are here assembled with such good intent.”  The King of England\r\nanswered this speech “in good French enough,” says Commynes.  The missal\r\nwas brought; the two kings swore and signed four distinct treaties; and\r\nthen they engaged in a long private conversation, after which Louis went\r\naway to Amiens and Edward to his army, whither Louis sent to him “all\r\nthat he had need of, even to torches and candles.”  As he went chatting\r\nalong the road with Commynes, Louis told him that he had found the King\r\nof England so desirous of paying a visit to Paris that he had been\r\nanything but pleased.  “He is a right handsome king,” said he: “he is\r\nvery fond of women; and he might well meet at Paris some smitten one who\r\nwould know how to make him such pretty speeches as to render him desirous\r\nof another visit.  His predecessors were far too much in Normandy and\r\nParis; his comradeship is worth nothing on our side of the sea; on the\r\nother side, over yonder, I should like very well to have him for good\r\nbrother and good friend.”  Throughout the whole course of the negotiation\r\nLouis had shown pliancy and magnificence; he had laden Edward’s chief\r\ncourtiers with presents; two thousand crowns by way of pension had been\r\nallowed to his grand chamberlain, Lord Hastings, who would not give an\r\nacknowledgment.  “This gift comes of the king your master’s good pleasure,\r\nand not at my request,” said he to Louis’s steward; “if you would have me\r\ntake it, you shall slip it here inside my sleeve, and have no letter or\r\nvoucher beyond; I do not wish to have people saying, ‘The grand\r\nchamberlain of England was the King of France’s pensioner,’ or to have my\r\nacknowledgments found in his exchequer-chamber.”  Lord Hastings had not\r\nalways been so scrupulous, for, on the 15th of May, 1471, he had received\r\nfrom the Duke of Burgundy a pension for which he had given an\r\nacknowledgment.  Another Englishman, whose name is not given by Commynes,\r\nwaxed wroth at hearing some one say, “Six hundred pipes of wine and a\r\npension given you by the king soon sent you back to England.”  “That is\r\ncertainly what everybody said,” answered the Englishman, “that you might\r\nhave the laugh against us.  But call you the money the king gives us\r\npension?  Why, it is tribute; and, by St. George, you may perhaps talk so\r\nmuch about it as to bring us down upon you again!”  “There was nothing in\r\nthe world,” says Commynes, “of which the king was more fearful than lest\r\nany word should escape him to make the English think that they were being\r\nderided; at the same time that he was laboring to gain them over, he was\r\ncareful to humor their susceptibilities;” and Commynes, under his\r\nschooling, had learned to understand them well: “They are rather slow\r\ngoers,” says he, “but you must have a little patience with them, and not\r\nlose your temper.  .  .  .  I fancy that to many it might appear that the\r\nking abased himself too much; but the wise might well hold that the\r\nkingdom was in great danger, save for the intervention of God, who did\r\ndispose the king’s mind to choose so wise a course, and did greatly\r\ntrouble that of the Duke of Burgundy.  .  .  .  Our king knew well the\r\nnature of the King of England, who was very fond of his ease and his\r\npleasures: when he had concluded these treaties with him, he ordered that\r\nthe money should be found with the greatest expedition, and every one had\r\nto lend somewhat to help to supply it on the spot.  The king said that\r\nthere was nothing in the world he would not do to thrust the King of\r\nEngland out of the realm, save only that he would never consent that the\r\nEnglish should have a bit of territory there; and, rather than suffer\r\nthat, he would put everything to jeopardy and risk.”\r\n\r\nCommynes had good reason to say that the kingdom was in great peril.  The\r\nintentions of Charles the Rash tended to nothing short of bringing back\r\nthe English into France, in order to share it with them.  He made no\r\nconcealment of it.  “I am so fond of the kingdom,” said he, “that I would\r\nmake six of it in France.”  He was passionately eager for the title of\r\nking.  He had put out feelers for it in the direction of Germany, and the\r\nemperor, Frederic III., had promised it to him together with that of\r\nvicar-general of the empire, on condition that his daughter, Mary of\r\nBurgundy, married Duke Maximilian, Frederic’s son.  Having been\r\nunsuccessful on the Rhine, Charles turned once more towards the Thames,\r\nand made alliance with Edward IV., King of England, with a view of\r\nrenewing the English invasion of France, flattering himself, of course,\r\nthat he would profit by it.  To destroy the work of Joan of Arc and\r\nCharles VII.--such was the design, a criminal and a shameful one for a\r\nFrench prince, which was checkmated by the peace of Peequigny.  Charles\r\nhimself acknowledged as much when, in his wrath at this treaty, he said,\r\n“He had not sought to bring over the English into France for any need he\r\nhad of them, but to enable them to recover what belonged to them;” and\r\nLouis XI. was a patriotic king when he declared that “there was nothing\r\nin the world he would not do to thrust the King of England out of the\r\nrealm, and, rather than suffer the English to have a bit of territory in\r\nFrance, he would put everything to jeopardy and risk.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy, as soon as he found out that the King of France\r\nhad, under the name of truce, made peace for seven years with the King of\r\nEngland, and that Edward IV. had recrossed the Channel with his army, saw\r\nthat his attempts, so far, were a failure.  Accordingly he too lost no\r\ntime in signing [on the 13th of September, 1475] a truce with King Louis\r\nfor nine years, and directing his ambition and aiming his blows against\r\nother quarters than Western France.  Two little states, his neighbors on\r\nthe east, Lorraine and Switzerland, became the object and the theatre of\r\nhis passion for war.  Lorraine had at that time for its duke Rene II., of\r\nthe house of Anjou through his mother Yolande, a young prince who was\r\nwavering, as so many others were, between France and Burgundy.  Charles\r\nsuddenly entered Lorraine, took possession of several castles, had the\r\ninhabitants who resisted hanged, besieged Nancy, which made a valiant\r\ndefence, and ended by conquering the capital as well as the\r\ncountry-places, leaving Duke Rene no asylum but the court of Louis XI.,\r\nof whom the Lorraine prince had begged a support, which Louis, after his\r\ncustom, had promised without rendering it effectual.  Charles did not\r\nstop there.  He had already been more than once engaged in hostilities\r\nwith his neighbors the Swiss; and he now learned that they had just made\r\na sanguinary raid upon the district of Vaud, the domain of a petty prince\r\nof the house of Savoy, and a devoted servant of the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nScarcely two months after the capture of Nancy, Charles set out, on the\r\n11th of June, 1476, to go and avenge his client, and wreak his haughty\r\nand turbulent humor upon these bold peasants of the Alps.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the truce he had but lately concluded with Charles the Rash,\r\nthe prudent Louis did not cease to keep an attentive watch upon him, and\r\nto reap advantage, against him, from the leisure secured to the King of\r\nFrance by his peace with the King of England and the Duke of Brittany.  A\r\nlate occurrence had still further strengthened his position: his brother\r\nCharles, who became Duke of Guienne, in 1469, after the treaty of\r\nPeronne, had died on the 24th of May, 1472.  There were sinister rumors\r\nabroad touching his death.  Louis was suspected, and even accused to the\r\nDuke of Brittany, an intimate friend of the deceased prince, of having\r\npoisoned his brother.  He caused an inquiry to be instituted into the\r\nmatter; but the inquiry itself was accused of being incomplete and\r\ninconclusive.  “King Louis did not, possibly, cause his brother’s death,”\r\n says M. de Barante, “but nobody thought him incapable of it.”  The will\r\nwhich Prince Charles had dictated a little before his death increased the\r\nhorror inspired by such a suspicion.  He manifested in it a feeling of\r\naffection and confidence towards the king his brother; he requested him\r\nto treat his servants kindly; “and if in any way,” he added, “we have ever\r\noffended our right dread and right well-beloved brother, we do beg him to\r\nbe pleased to forgive us; since, for our part, if ever in any matter he\r\nhath offended us, we do affectionately pray the Divine Majesty to forgive\r\nhim, and with good courage and good will do we on our part forgive him.”\r\n The Duke of Guienne at the same time appointed the king executor of his\r\nwill.  If we acknowledge, however, that Louis was not incapable of such a\r\ncrime, it must be admitted that there is no trust-worthy proof of his\r\nguilt.  At any rate his brother’s death had important results for him.\r\nNot only did it set him free from all fresh embarrassment in that\r\ndirection, but it also restored to him the beautiful province of Guienne,\r\nand many a royal client.  He treated the friends of Prince Charles,\r\nwhether they had or had not been heretofore his own, with marked\r\nattention.  He re-established at Bordeaux the parliament he had removed\r\nto Poitiers; he pardoned the towns of Pdzenas and Montignac for some late\r\nseditions; and, lastly, he took advantage of this incident to pacify and\r\nsatisfy this portion of the kingdom.  Of the great feudal chieftains who,\r\nin 1464, had formed against him the League of the common weal, the Duke\r\nof Burgundy was the only one left on the scene, and in a condition to put\r\nhim in peril.\r\n\r\nBut though here was for the future his only real adversary, Louis XI.\r\ncontinued, and with reason, to regard the Duke of Burgundy as his most\r\nformidable foe, and never ceased to look about for means and allies\r\nwherewith to encounter him.  He could no longer count upon the\r\nco-operation, more or less general, of the Flemings.  His behavior to the\r\nLiegese after the incident at Peronne, and his share in the disaster\r\nwhich befell Liege, had lost him all his credit in the Flemish cities.\r\nThe Flemings, besides, had been disheartened and disgusted at the idea of\r\ncompromising themselves for or against their Burgundian prince.  When\r\nthey saw him entering upon the campaign in Lorraine and Switzerland, they\r\nthemselves declared to him what he might or might not expect from them.\r\n“If he were pressed,” they said, “by the Germans or the Swiss, and had\r\nnot with him enough men to make his way back freely to his own borders,\r\nhe had only to let them know, and they would expose their persons and\r\ntheir property to go after him and fetch him back safely within his said\r\nborders, but as for making war again at his instance, they were not free\r\nto aid him any more with either men or money.”  Louis XI., then, had\r\nnothing to expect from the Flemings any more; but for two years past, and\r\nso soon as he observed the commencement of hostilities between the Duke\r\nof Burgundy and the Swiss, he had paved the way for other alliances in\r\nthat quarter.  In 1473 he had sent “to the most high and mighty lords and\r\nmost dear friends of ours, them of the league and city of Berne and of\r\nthe great and little league of Germany, ambassadors charged to make\r\nproposals to them, if they would come to an understanding to be friends\r\nof friends and foes of foes” (make an offensive and defensive alliance).\r\nThe proposal was brought before the diet of the cantons assembled at\r\nLucerne.  The King of France “regretted that the Duke of Burgundy would\r\nnot leave the Swiss in peace; he promised that his advice and support,\r\nwhether in men or in money, should not be wanting to them; he offered to\r\neach canton an annual friendly donation of two thousand livres; and he\r\nengaged not to summon their valiant warriors to take service save in case\r\nof pressing need, and unless Switzerland were herself at war.”  The\r\nquestion was discussed with animation; the cantons were divided; some\r\nwould have nothing to do with either the alliance or the money of Louis\r\nXI., of whom they spoke with great distrust and antipathy; others\r\ninsisted upon the importance of being supported by the King of France in\r\ntheir quarrels with the Duke of Burgundy, and scornfully repudiated the\r\nfear that the influence and money of Louis would bring a taint upon the\r\nindependence and the good morals of their country.  The latter opinion\r\ncarried the day; and, on the 2d of October, 1474, conformably with a\r\ntreaty concluded, on the 10th of the previous January, between the King\r\nof France and the league of Swiss cantons, the canton of Berne made to\r\nthe French legation the following announcement: “If, in the future, the\r\nsaid lords of the league asked help from the King of France against the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, and if the said lord king, being engaged in his own\r\nwars, could not help them with men, in this case he should cause to be\r\nlodged and handed over to them, in the city of Lyons, twenty thousand\r\nRhenish florins every quarter of a year, as long as the war actually\r\ncontinued; and we, on our part, do promise, on our faith and honor, that\r\nevery time and however many times the said lord king shall ask help from\r\nthe said lords of the league, we will take care that they do help him and\r\naid him with six thousand men in his wars and expeditions, according to\r\nthe tenor of the late alliance and union made between them, howbeit on\r\npayment.”\r\n\r\nA Bernese messenger carried this announcement to the Burgundian camp\r\nbefore the fortress of Neuss, and delivered it into the hands of Duke\r\nCharles himself, whose only remark, as he ground his teeth, was, “Ah!\r\nBerne! Berne!”  At the be-ginning of January, 1476, he left Nancy, of\r\nwhich he had recently gained possession, returned to Besancon, and\r\nstarted thence on the 6th of February to take the field with an army\r\namounting, it is said, to thirty or forty thousand men, provided with a\r\npowerful artillery and accompanied by an immense baggage-train, wherein\r\nCharles delighted to display his riches and magnificence in contrast with\r\nthe simplicity and roughness of his personal habits.  At the rumor of\r\nsuch an armament the Swiss attempted to keep off the war from their\r\ncountry.  “I have heard tell,” says Commynes, “by a knight of theirs, who\r\nhad been sent by them to the said duke, that he told him that against\r\nthem he could gain nothing, for that their country was very barren and\r\npoor; that there were no good prisoners to make, and that the spurs and\r\nthe horses’ bits in his own army were worth more money than all the\r\npeople of their territory could pay in ransom even if they were taken.”\r\n Charles, however, gave no heed, saw nothing in their representations but\r\nan additional reason for hurrying on his movements with confidence, and\r\non the 19th of February arrived before Granson, a little town in the\r\ndistrict of Vaud, where war had already begun.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. watched all these incidents closely, keeping agents everywhere,\r\ntreating secretly with everybody, with the Duke of Burgundy as well as\r\nwith the Swiss, knowing perfectly well what he wanted, but holding\r\nhimself ready to face anything, no matter what the event might be.  When\r\nhe saw that the crisis was coming, he started from Tours and went to take\r\nup his quarters at Lyons, close to the theatre of war and within an easy\r\ndistance for speedy information and prompt action.  Scarcely had he\r\narrived, on the 4th of March, when he learned that, on the day but one\r\nbefore, Duke Charles had been tremendously beaten by the Swiss at\r\nGranson; the squadrons of his chivalry had not been able to make any\r\nimpression upon the battalions of Berne, Schwitz, Soleure, and Fribourg,\r\narmed with pikes eighteen feet long; and at sight of the mountaineers\r\nmarching with huge strides and lowered heads upon their foes and\r\nheralding their advance by the lowings of the bull of Uri and the cow of\r\nUnterwalden, two enormous instruments made of buffalo-horn, and given, it\r\nwas said, to their ancestors by Charlemagne, the whole Burgundian army,\r\nseized with panic, had dispersed in all directions, “like smoke before\r\nthe northern blast.”  Charles himself had been forced to fly with only\r\nfive horsemen, it is said, for escort, leaving all his camp, artillery,\r\ntreasure, oratory, jewels, down to his very cap garnished with precious\r\nstones and his collar of the Golden Fleece, in the hands of the “poor\r\nSwiss,” astounded at their booty and having no suspicion of its value.\r\n“They sold the silver plate for a few pence, taking it for pewter,” says\r\nM. de Barante.  Those magnificent silks and velvets, that cloth of gold\r\nand damask, that Flanders lace, and those carpets from Arras which were\r\nfound heaped up in chests, were cut in pieces and distributed by the ell,\r\nlike common canvas in a village shop.  The duke’s large diamond which he\r\nwore round his neck, and which had once upon a time glittered in the\r\ncrown of the Great Mogul, was found on the road, inside a little box set\r\nwith fine pearls.  The man who picked it up kept the box and threw away\r\nthe diamond as a mere bit of glass.  Afterwards he thought better of it;\r\nwent to look for the stone, found it under a wagon, and sold it for a\r\ncrown to a clergyman of the neighborhood.  “There was nothing saved but\r\nthe bare life,” says Commynes.\r\n\r\nThat even the bare life was saved was a source of sorrow to Louis XI.\r\nin the very midst of his joy at the defeat.  He was, nevertheless, most\r\nproper in his behavior and language towards Duke Charles, who sent to him\r\nSire de Contay “with humble and gracious words, which was contrary to his\r\nnature and his custom,” says Commynes; “but see how an hour’s time\r\nchanged him; he prayed the king to be pleased to observe loyally the\r\ntruce concluded between them, he excused himself for not having appeared\r\nat the interview which was to have taken place at Auxerre, and he bound\r\nhimself to be present, shortly, either there or elsewhere, according to\r\nthe king’s good pleasure.”  Louis promised him all he asked, “for,” adds\r\nCommynes, “it did not seem to him time, as yet, to do other-wise;” and he\r\ngave the duke the good advice “to return home and bide there quietly,\r\nrather than go on stubbornly warring with yon folks of the Alps, so poor\r\nthat there was nought to gain by taking their lands, but valiant and\r\nobstinate in battle.”  Louis might give this advice fearlessly, being\r\nquite certain that Charles would not follow it.  The latter’s defeat at\r\nGranson had thrown him into a state of gloomy irritation.  At Lausanne,\r\nwhere he staid for some time, he had “a great sickness, proceeding,” says\r\nCommynes, “from grief and sadness on account of this shame that he had\r\nsuffered; and, to tell the truth, I think that never since was his\r\nunderstanding so good as it had been before this battle.”  Before he fell\r\nill, on the 12th of March, Charles issued orders from his camp before\r\nLausanne to his lieutenant at Luxembourg to put under arrest “and visit\r\nwith the extreme penalty of death, without waiting for other command from\r\nus, all the men-at-arms, archers, cross-bowmen, infantry, or other\r\nsoldiery” who had fled or dispersed after the disaster at Granson; “and\r\nas to those who be newly coming into our service it is ordered by us that\r\nthey, on pain of the same punishment, do march towards us with all\r\ndiligence; and if they make any delay, our pleasure is that you proceed\r\nagainst them in the manner hereinabove declared without fail in any way.”\r\n With such fiery and ruthless energy Charles collected a fresh army,\r\nhaving a strength, it is said, of from twenty-five to thirty thousand\r\nmen, Burgundians, Flemings, Italians, and English; and after having\r\nreviewed it on the platform above Lausanne, he set out on the 27th of\r\nMay, 1476, and pitched his camp on the 10th of June before the little\r\ntown of Morat, six leagues from Berne, giving notice everywhere that it\r\nwas war to the death that he intended.  The Swiss were expecting it, and\r\nwere prepared for it.  The energy of pride was going to be pitted against\r\nthe energy of patriotism.  “The Duke of Burgundy is here with all his\r\nforces, his Italian mercenaries and some traitors of Germans,” said the\r\nletter written to the Bernese by the governor of Morat, Adrian of\r\nBubenberg; “the gentlemen of the magistracy, of the council, and of the\r\nburgherhood may be free from fear and hurry, and may set at rest the\r\nminds of all our confederates: I will defend Morat;” and he swore to the\r\ngarrison and the inhabitants that he would put to death the first who\r\nshould speak of surrender.  Morat had been for ten days holding out\r\nagainst the whole army of the Burgundians; the confederate Swiss were\r\narriving successively at Berne; and the men of Zurich alone were late.\r\nTheir fellow-countryman, Hans Waldmann, wrote to them, “We positively\r\nmust give battle or we are lost, every one of us.  The Burgundians are\r\nthree times more numerous than they were at Granson, but we shall manage\r\nto pull through.  With God’s help great honor awaits us.  Do not fail to\r\ncome as quickly as possible.”  On the 21st of June, in the evening, the\r\nZurichers arrived.  “Ha!” the duke was just saying, “have these hounds\r\nlost heart, pray?  I was told that we were about to get at them.”  Next\r\nday, the 22d of June, after a pelting rain and with the first gleams of\r\nthe returning sun, the Swiss attacked the Burgundian camp.  A man-at-arms\r\ncame and told the duke, who would not believe it, and dismissed the\r\nmessenger with a coarse insult, but hurried, nevertheless, to the point\r\nof attack.  The battle was desperate; but before the close of the day it\r\nwas hopelessly lost by the Burgundians.  Charles had still three thousand\r\nhorse, but he saw them break up, and he himself had great difficulty in\r\ngetting away, with merely a dozen men behind him, and reaching Merges,\r\ntwelve leagues from Morat.  Eight or ten thousand of his men had fallen,\r\nmore than half, it is said, killed in cold blood after the fight.  Never\r\nhad the Swiss been so dead set against their foes; and “as cruel as at\r\nMorat” was for a long while a common expression.\r\n\r\n“The king,” says Commynes, “always willingly gave somewhat to him who was\r\nthe first to bring him some great news, without forgetting the messenger,\r\nand he took pleasure in speaking thereof before the news came, saying, ‘I\r\nwill give so much to him who first brings me such and such news.’  My\r\nlord of Bouchage and I (being together) had the first message about the\r\nbattle of Morat, and told it both together to the king, who gave each of\r\nus two hundred marks of silver.”  Next day Louis, as prudent in the hour\r\nof joy as of reverse, wrote to Count de Dampmartin, who was in command of\r\nhis troops concentrated at Senlis, with orders to hold himself in\r\nreadiness for any event, but still carefully observe the truce with the\r\nDuke of Burgundy.  Charles at that time was thinking but little of Louis\r\nand their truce; driven to despair by the disaster at Morat, but more\r\ndead set than ever on the struggle, he repaired from Morges to Gex, and\r\nfrom Gex to Salins, and summoned successively, in July and August, at\r\nSalins, at Dijon, at Brussels, and at Luxembourg the estates of his\r\nvarious domains, making to all of them an appeal, at the same time\r\nsupplicatory and imperious, calling upon them for a fresh army with which\r\nto recommence the war with the Swiss, and fresh subsidies with which to\r\npay it.  “If ever,” said he, “you have desired to serve us and do us\r\npleasure, see to doing and accomplishing all that is bidden you; make no\r\ndefault in anything whatsoever, and he henceforth in dread of the\r\npunishments which may ensue.”  But there was everywhere a feeling of\r\ndisgust with the service of Duke Charles; there was no more desire of\r\nserving him and no more fear of disobeying him; he encountered almost\r\neverywhere nothing but objections, complaints, and refusals, or else a\r\nsilence and an inactivity which were still worse.  Indignant, dismayed,\r\nand dumbfounded at such desertion, Charles retired to his castle of La\r\nRiviere, between Pontarlier and Joux, and shut himself up there for more\r\nthan six weeks, without, however, giving up the attempt to collect\r\nsoldiers.  “Howbeit,” says Commynes, “he made but little of it; he kept\r\nhimself quite solitary, and he seemed to do it from sheer obstinacy more\r\nthan anything else.  His natural heat was so great that he used to drink\r\nno wine, generally took barley-water in the morning and ate preserved\r\nrose-leaves to keep himself cool; but sorrow changed his complexion so\r\nmuch that he was obliged to drink good strong wine without water, and, to\r\nbring the blood back to his heart, burning tow was put into cupping-\r\nglasses, and they were applied thus heated to the region of the heart.\r\nSuch are the passions of those who have never felt adversity, especially\r\nof proud princes who know not how to discover any remedy.  The first\r\nrefuge, in such a case, is to have recourse to God, to consider whether\r\none have offended Him in aught, and to confess one’s misdeeds.  After\r\nthat, what does great good is to converse with some friend, and not be\r\nashamed to show one’s grief before him, for that lightens and comforts\r\nthe heart; and not at any rate to take the course the duke took of\r\nconcealing himself and keeping himself solitary; he was so terrible to\r\nhis own folks that none durst come forward to give him any comfort or\r\ncounsel; but all left him to do as he pleased, feeling that, if they made\r\nhim any remonstrance, it would be the worse for them.”\r\n\r\nBut events take no account of the fears and weaknesses of men.  Charles\r\nlearned before long that the Swiss were not his most threatening foes,\r\nand that he had something else to do instead of going after them amongst\r\ntheir mountains.  During his two campaigns against them, the Duke of\r\nLorraine, Rend II., whom he had despoiled of his dominions and driven\r\nfrom Nancy, had been wandering amongst neighboring princes and people in\r\nFrance, Germany, and Switzerland, at the courts of Louis XI. and the\r\nEmperor Frederic III., on visits to the patricians of Berne, and in the\r\nfree towns of the Rhine.  He was young, sprightly, amiable, and brave; he\r\nhad nowhere met with great assistance, but he had been well received, and\r\ncertain promises had been made him.  When he saw the contest so hotly\r\ncommenced between the Duke of Burgundy and the Swiss, he resolutely put\r\nhimself at the service of the republican mountaineers, fought for them in\r\ntheir ranks, and powerfully contributed to their victory at Morat.  The\r\ndefeat of Charles and his retreat to his castle of La Riviere gave Rend\r\nnew hopes, and gained him some credit amongst the powers which had\r\nhitherto merely testified towards him a good will of but little value;\r\nand his partisans in Lorraine recovered confidence in his for-tunes.  One\r\nday, as he was at his prayers in a church, a rich widow, Madame Walther,\r\ncame up to him in her mantle and hood, made him a deep reverence, and\r\nhanded him a purse of gold to help him in winning back his duchy.  The\r\ncity of Strasbourg gave him some cannon, four hundred cavalry, and eight\r\nhundred infantry; Louis XI. lent him some money; and Rend before long\r\nfound himself in a position to raise a small army and retake Epinal,\r\nSaint-Did, Vaudemont, and the majority of the small towns in Lorraine.\r\nHe then went and laid siege to Nancy.  The Duke of Burgundy had left\r\nthere as governor John de Rubemprd, lord of Bievres, with a feeble\r\ngarrison, which numbered amongst its ranks three hundred English, picked\r\nmen.  Sire de Bievres sent message after message to Charles, who did not\r\neven reply to him.  The town was short of provisions; the garrison was\r\ndispirited; and the commander of the English was killed.  Sire de\r\nBievres, a loyal servant, but a soldier of but little energy, determined\r\nto capitulate.  On the 6th of October, 1476, he evacuated the place at\r\nthe head of his men, all safe in person and property.  At sight of him\r\nRend dismounted, and handsomely went forward to meet him, saying, “Sir,\r\nmy good uncle, I thank you for having so courteously governed my duchy;\r\nif you find it agreeable to remain with me, you shall fare the same as\r\nmyself.”  “Sir,” answered Sire de Bievres, “I hope that you will not\r\nthink ill of me for this war; I very much wish that my lord of Burgundy\r\nhad never begun it, and I am much afraid that neither he nor I will see\r\nthe end of it.”\r\n\r\nSire de Bievres had no idea how true a prophet he was.  Almost at the\r\nvery moment when he was capitulating, Duke Charles, throwing off his\r\nsombre apathy, was once more entering Lorraine with all the troops he\r\ncould collect, and on the 22d of October he in his turn went and laid\r\nsiege to Nancy.  Duke Rend, not considering himself in a position to\r\nmaintain the contest with only such forces as he had with him, determined\r\nto quit Nancy in person and go in search of re-enforcements at a\r\ndistance, at the same time leaving in the town a not very numerous but a\r\ndevoted garrison, which, together with the inhabitants, promised to hold\r\nout for two months.  And it did hold out whilst Rend was visiting\r\nStrasbourg, Berne, Zurich, and Lucerne, presenting himself before the\r\ncouncils of these petty republics with, in order to please them, a tame\r\nbear behind him, which he left at the doors, and promising, thanks to\r\nLouis XI.’s agents in Switzerland, extraordinary pay.  He thus obtained\r\nauxiliaries to the number of eight thousand fighting men.  He had,\r\nmoreover, in the very camp of the Duke of Burgundy, a secret ally, an\r\nItalian condottiere, the Count of Campo-Basso, who, either from personal\r\nhatred or on grounds of interest, was betraying the master to whom he had\r\nbound himself.  The year before, he had made an offer to Louis XI. to go\r\nover to him with his troops during a battle, or to hand over to him the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, dead or alive.  Louis mistrusted the traitor, and sent\r\nCharles notice of the offers made by Campo-Basso.  But Charles mistrusted\r\nLouis’s information, and kept Campo-Basso in his service.  A little\r\nbefore the battle of Morat Louis had thought better of his scruples or\r\nhis doubts, and had accepted, with the compensation of a pension, the\r\nkind offices of Campo-Basso.  When the war took place in Lorraine, the\r\ncondottiere, whom Duke Charles had one day grossly insulted, entered into\r\ncommunication with Duke Rend also, and took secret measures for insuring\r\nthe failure of the Burgundian attempts upon Nancy.  Such was the position\r\nof the two princes and the two armies, when, on the 4th of June, 1477,\r\nRend, having returned with re-enforcements to Lorraine, found himself\r\nconfronted with Charles, who was still intent upon the siege of Nancy.\r\nThe Duke of Burgundy assembled his captains.  “Well!” said he, “since\r\nthese drunken scoundrels are upon us, and are coming here to look for\r\nmeat and drink, what ought we to do?”  The majority of those present were\r\nof opinion that the right thing to do was to fall back into the duchy of\r\nLuxembourg, there to recruit the enfeebled army.  “Duke Rene,” they said,\r\n“is poor; he will not be able to bear very long the expense of the war,\r\nand his allies will leave him as soon as he has no more money; wait but\r\na little, and success is certain.”  Charles flew into a passion.  “My\r\nfather and I,” said he, “knew how to thrash these Lorrainers; and we will\r\nmake them remember it.  By St. George! I will not fly before a boy,\r\nbefore Rend of Vaudemont, who is coming at the head of this scum.  He has\r\nnot so many men with him as people think; the Germans have no idea of\r\nleaving their stoves in winter.  This evening we will deliver the assault\r\nagainst the town, and to-morrow we will give battle.”\r\n\r\nAnd the next day, January the 5th, the battle did take place, in the\r\nplain of Nancy.  The Duke of Burgundy assumed his armor very early in the\r\nmorning.  When he put on his helmet, the gilt lion, which formed the\r\ncrest of it, fell off.  “That is a sign from God!” said he; but,\r\nnevertheless, he went and drew up his army in line of battle.  The day\r\nbut one before, Campo-Basso had drawn off his troops to a considerable\r\ndistance; and he presented himself before Duke Rene, having taken off his\r\nred scarf and his cross of St. Andrew, and being quite ready, he said, to\r\ngive proofs of his zeal on the spot.  Rene spoke about it to his Swiss\r\ncaptains.  “We have no mind,” said they, “to have this traitor of an\r\nItalian fighting beside us; our fathers never made use of such folk or\r\nsuch practices in order to conquer.”  And Campo-Basso held aloof.  The\r\nbattle began in gloomy weather, and beneath heavy flakes of snow, lasted\r\nbut a short time, and was not at all murderous in the actual conflict,\r\nbut the pursuit was terrible.  Campo-Basso and his troops held the bridge\r\nof Bouxieres, by which the Burgundian fugitives would want to pass; and\r\nthe Lorrainerss of Rend and his Swiss and German allies scoured the\r\ncountry, killing all with whom they fell in.  Rend returned to Nancy in\r\nthe midst of a population whom his victory had delivered from famine as\r\nwell as war.  “To show him what sufferings they had endured,” says M. de\r\nBarante, “they conceived the idea of piling up in a heap, before the door\r\nof his hostel, the heads of the horses, dogs, mules, cats, and other\r\nunclean animals which had for several weeks past been the only food of\r\nthe besieged.”  When the first burst of joy was over, the question was,\r\nwhat had become of the Duke of Burgundy; nobody had a notion; and his\r\nbody was not found amongst the dead in any of the places where his most\r\nvaliant and faithful warriors had fallen.  The rumor ran that he was not\r\ndead; some said that one of his servants had picked him up wounded on the\r\nfield of battle, and was taking care of him, none knew where; and\r\naccording to others, a German lord had made him prisoner, and carried him\r\noff beyond the Rhine.  “Take good heed,” said many people, “how ye\r\ncomport yourselves otherwise than if he were still alive, for his\r\nvengeance would be terrible on his return.”  On the evening of the day\r\nafter the battle, the Count of Campo-Basso brought to Duke Rend a young\r\nRoman page who, he said, had from a distance seen his master fall, and\r\ncould easily find the spot again.  Under his guidance a move was made\r\ntowards a pond hard by the town; and there, half buried in the slush of\r\nthe pond, were some dead bodies, lying stripped.  A poor washerwoman,\r\namongst the rest, had joined in the search; she saw the glitter of a\r\njewel in the ring upon one of the fingers of a corpse whose face was not\r\nvisible; she went forward, turned the body over, and at once cried, “Ah!\r\nmy prince!”  There was a rush to the spot immediately.  As the head was\r\nbeing detached from the ice to which it stuck, the skin came off, and a\r\nlarge wound was discovered.  On examining the body with care, it was\r\nunhesitatingly recognized to be that of Charles, by his doctor, by his\r\nchaplain, by Oliver de la Marche, his chamberlain, and by several grooms\r\nof the chamber; and certain marks, such as the scar of the wound he had\r\nreceived at Montlhery, and the loss of two teeth, put their assertion\r\nbeyond a doubt.  As soon as Duke Rend knew that they had at last found\r\nthe body of the Duke of Burgundy, he had it removed to the town, and laid\r\non a bed of state of black velvet, under a canopy of black satin.  It was\r\ndressed in a garment of white satin; a ducal crown, set with precious\r\nstones, was placed on the disfigured brow; the lower limbs were cased in\r\nscarlet, and on the heels were gilded spurs.  The Duke of Lorraine went\r\nand sprinkled holy water on the corpse of his unhappy rival, and, taking\r\nthe dead hand beneath the pall, “Ah! dear cousin,” said he, with tears in\r\nhis _eyes_.\r\n\r\nFor the time that I knew him he was not cruel; but he became so before\r\nhis death, and that was a bad omen for a long existence.  He was very\r\nsumptuous in dress and in all other matters, and a little too much so.\r\nHe showed very great honor to ambassadors and foreign folks; they were\r\nright well feasted and entertained by him.  He was desirous of great\r\nglory, and it was that more than ought else that brought him into his\r\nwars; he would have been right glad to be like to those ancient princes\r\nof whom there has been so much talk after their death; he was as bold a\r\nman as any that reigned in his day.  .  .  .  After the long felicity and\r\ngreat riches of this house of Burgundy, and after three great princes,\r\ngood and wise, who had lasted six score years and more in good sense and\r\nvirtue, God gave this people the Duke Charles, who kept them constantly\r\nin great war, travail, and expense, and almost as much in winter as in\r\nsummer.  Many rich and comfortable folks were dead or ruined in prison\r\nduring these wars.  The great losses began in front of Neuss, and\r\ncontinued through three or four battles up to the hour of his death; and\r\nat that hour all the strength of his country was sapped; and dead, or\r\nruined, or captive, were all who could or would have defended the\r\ndominions and the honor of his house.  Thus it seems that this loss was\r\nan equal set-off to the time of their felicity.  “Please God to forgive\r\nDuke Charles his sins!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Corpse of Charles the Rash Discovered----236]\r\n\r\nTo this pious wish of Commynes, after so judicious a sketch, we may add\r\nanother: Please God that people may no more suffer themselves to be taken\r\ncaptive by the corrupting and ruinous pleasures procured for them by\r\ntheir masters’ grand but wicked or foolish enterprises, and may learn to\r\ngive to the men who govern them a glory in proportion to the wisdom and\r\njustice of their deeds, and by no means to the noise they make and the\r\nrisks they sow broadcast around them!\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of Charles the Rash was for Louis XI. an unexpected\r\nand unhoped-for blessing, and one in which he could scarcely believe.\r\nThe news reached him on the 9th of January, at the castle of Plessis-les-\r\nTours, by the medium of a courier sent to him by George de la Tremoille,\r\nSire de Craon, commanding his troops on the frontier of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n“Insomuch as this house of Burgundy was greater and more powerful than the\r\nothers,” says Commynes, “was the pleasure great for the king more than\r\nall the others together; it was the joy of seeing himself set above all\r\nthose he hated, and above his principal foes; it might well seem to him\r\nthat he would never in his life meet any to gainsay him in his kingdom,\r\nor in the neighborhood near him.”  He replied the same day to Sire de\r\nCraon, “Sir Count, my good friend, I have received your letters, and the\r\ngood news you have brought to my knowledge, for which I thank you as much\r\nas I am able.  Now is the time for you to employ all your five natural\r\nwits to put the duchy and countship of Burgundy in my hands.  And, to\r\nthat end, place yourself with your band and the governor of Champagne, if\r\nso be that the Duke of Burgundy is dead, within the said country, and\r\ntake care, for the dear love you bear me, that you maintain amongst the\r\nmen of war the best order, just as if you were inside Paris; and make\r\nknown to them that I am minded to treat them and keep them better than\r\nany in my kingdom; and that, in respect of our god-daughter, I have an\r\nintention of completing the marriage that I have already had in\r\ncontemplation between my lord the _dauphin_ and her.  Sir Count, I\r\nconsider it understood that you will not enter the said country, or make\r\nmention of that which is written above, unless the Duke of Burgundy be\r\ndead.  And, in any case, I pray you to serve me in accordance with the\r\nconfidence I have in you.  And adieu!”\r\n\r\nBeneath the discreet reserve inspired by a remnant of doubt concerning\r\nthe death of his enemy, this letter contained the essence of Louis XI.’s\r\ngrand and very natural stroke of policy.  Charles the Rash had left only\r\na daughter, Mary of Burgundy, sole heiress of all his dominions.  To\r\nannex this magnificent heritage to the crown of France by the marriage of\r\nthe heiress with the _dauphin_ who was one day to be Charles VIII., was\r\nclearly for the best interests of the nation as well as of the French\r\nkingship, and such had, accordingly, been Louis XI.’s first idea.  “When\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy was still alive,” says Commynes, “many a time spoke\r\nthe king to me of what he would do if the duke should happen to die; and\r\nhe spoke most reasonably, saying that he would try to make a match\r\nbetween his son (who is now our king) and the said duke’s daughter (who\r\nwas afterwards Duchess of Austria); and if she were not minded to hear of\r\nit for that my lord, the _dauphin_, was much younger than she, he would\r\nessay to get her married to some younger lord of this realm, for to keep\r\nher and her subjects in amity, and to recover without dispute that which\r\nhe claimed as his; and still was the said lord on this subject a week\r\nbefore he knew of the said duke’s death.  .  .  .  Howbeit it seems that\r\nthe king our master took not hold of matters by the end by which he\r\nshould have taken hold for to come out triumphant, and to add to his\r\ncrown all those great lordships, either by sound title or by marriage, as\r\neasily he might have done.”\r\n\r\nCommynes does not explain or specify clearly the mistake with which he\r\nreproaches his master.  Louis XI., in spite of his sound sense and\r\ncorrect appreciation, generally, of the political interests of France and\r\nof his crown, allowed himself on this great occasion to be swayed by\r\nsecondary considerations and personal questions.  His son’s marriage with\r\nthe heiress of Burgundy might cause some embarrassment in his relations\r\nwith Edward IV., King of England, to whom he had promised the _dauphin_\r\nas a husband for his daughter Elizabeth, who was already sometimes\r\ncalled, in England, the Dauphiness.  In 1477, at the death of the duke\r\nher father, Mary of Burgundy was twenty years old, and Charles, the\r\n_dauphin_, was barely eight.  There was another question, a point of\r\nfeudal law, as to whether Burgundy, properly so called, was a fief which\r\nwomen could inherit, or a fief which, in default of a male heir, must\r\nlapse to the suzerain.  Several of the Flemish towns which belonged to\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy were weary of his wars and his violence, and showed\r\nan inclination to pass over to the sway of the King of France.  All these\r\nfacts offered pretexts, opportunities, and chances of success for that\r\ncourse of egotistical pretension and cunning intrigue in which Louis\r\ndelighted and felt confident of his ability; and into it he plunged after\r\nthe death of Charles the Rash.  Though he still spoke of his desire of\r\nmarrying his son, the _dauphin_, to Mary of Burgundy, it was no longer\r\nhis dominant and ever-present idea.  Instead of taking pains to win the\r\ngood will and the heart of Mary herself, he labored with his usual zeal\r\nand address to dispute her rights, to despoil her brusquely of one or\r\nanother town in her dominions, to tamper with her servants, or excite\r\nagainst them the wrath of the populace.  Two of the most devoted and most\r\nable amongst them, Hugonet, chancellor of Burgundy, and Sire\r\nd’Humbercourt, were the victims of Louis XI.’s hostile manoeuvres and\r\nof blind hatred on the part of the Ghentese; and all the Princess Mary’s\r\npassionate entreaties were powerless both with the king and with the\r\nFlemings to save them from the scaffold.  And so Mary, alternately\r\nthreatened or duped, attacked in her just rights or outraged in her\r\naffections, being driven to extremity, exhibited a resolution never to\r\nbecome the daughter of a prince unworthy of the confidence she, poor\r\norphan, had placed in the spiritual tie which marked him out as her\r\nprotector.  “I understand,” said she, “that my father had arranged my\r\nmarriage with the emperor’s son; I have no mind for any other.”  Louis in\r\nhis alarm tried all sorts of means, seductive and violent, to prevent\r\nsuch a reverse.  He went in person amongst the Walloon and Flemish\r\nprovinces belonging to Mary.  “That I come into this country,” said he to\r\nthe inhabitants of Quesnoy, “is for nothing but the interests of Mdlle.\r\nde Burgundy, my well-beloved cousin and god-daughter.  .  .  .  Of her\r\nwicked advisers some would have her espouse the son of the Duke of\r\nCleves; but he is a prince of far too little lustre for so illustrious a\r\nprincess; I know that he has a bad sore on his leg; he is a drunkard,\r\nlike all Germans, and, after drinking, he will break his glass over her\r\nhead, and beat her.  Others would ally her with the English, the\r\nkingdom’s old enemies, who all lead bad lives: there are some who would\r\ngive her for her husband the emperor’s son, but those princes of the\r\nimperial house are the most avaricious in the world; they will carry off\r\nMdlle. de Burgundy to Germany, a strange land and a coarse, where she\r\nwill know no consolation, whilst your land of Hainault will be left\r\nwithout any lord to govern and defend it.  If my fair cousin were well\r\nadvised, she would espouse the _dauphin_; you speak French, you Walloon\r\npeople; you want a prince of France, not a German.  As for me, I esteem\r\nthe folks of Hainault more than any nation in the world; there is none\r\nmore noble, and in my sight a hind of Hainault is worth more than a grand\r\ngentleman of any other country.”  At the very time that he was using such\r\nflattering language to the good folks of Hainault, he was writing to the\r\nCount de Dampmartin, whom he had charged with the repression of\r\ninsurrection in the country-parts of Ghent and Bruges, “Sir Grand Master,\r\nI send you some mowers to cut down the crop you wot off; put them, I pray\r\nyou, to work, and spare not some casks of wine to set them drinking, and\r\nto make them drunk.  I pray you, my friend, let there be no need to\r\nreturn a second time to do the mowing, for you are as much crown-officer\r\nas I am, and, if I am king, you are grand master.”  Dampmartin executed\r\nthe king’s orders without scruple; and at the season of harvest the\r\nFlemish country-places were devastated.  “Little birds of heaven,” cries\r\nthe Flemish chronicler Molinet, “ye who are wont to haunt our fields and\r\nrejoice our hearts with your amorous notes, now seek out other countries;\r\nget ye hence from our tillages, for the king of the mowers of France hath\r\ndone worse to us than do the tempests.”\r\n\r\nAll the efforts of Louis XI., his winning speeches, and his ruinous\r\ndeeds, did not succeed in averting the serious check he dreaded.  On the\r\n18th of August, 1477, seven months after the battle of Nancy and the\r\ndeath of Charles the Rash, Arch-duke Maximilian, son of the Emperor\r\nFrederick III., arrived at Ghent to wed Mary of Burgundy.  “The moment he\r\ncaught sight of his betrothed,” say the Flemish chroniclers, “they both\r\nbent down to the ground and turned as pale as death--a sign of mutual\r\nlove according to some, an omen of unhappiness according to others.”\r\n Next day, August 19, the marriage was celebrated with great simplicity in\r\nthe chapel of the Hotel de Ville; and Maximilian swore to respect the\r\nprivileges of Ghent.  A few days afterwards he renewed the same oath at\r\nBruges, in the midst of decorations bearing the modest device, “Most\r\nglorious prince, defend us lest we perish” (Gloriosissime princeps,\r\ndefende nos ne pereamus).  Not only did Louis XI. thus fail in his first\r\nwise design of incorporating with France, by means of a marriage between\r\nhis son the _dauphin_ and Princess Mary, the heritage of the Dukes of\r\nBurgundy, but he suffered the heiress and a great part of the heritage\r\nto pass into the hands of the son of the German emperor; and thereby he\r\npaved the way for that determined rivalry between the houses of France\r\nand Austria, which was a source of so many dangers and woes to both\r\nstates during three centuries.  It is said that in 1745, when Louis XV.,\r\nafter the battle of Fontenoy, entered Bruges cathedral, he remarked, as\r\nhe gazed on the tombs of the Austro-Burgundian princes, “There is the\r\norigin of all our wars.”  In vain, when the marriage of Maximilian and\r\nMary was completed, did Louis XI. attempt to struggle against his new and\r\ndangerous neighbor; his campaigns in the Flemish provinces, in 1478 and\r\n1479, had no great result; he lost, on the 7th of August, 1479, the\r\nbattle of Guinegate, between St. Omer and Therouanne; and before long,\r\ntired of war, which was not his favorite theatre for the display of his\r\nabilities, he ended by concluding with Maximilian a truce at first, and\r\nthen a peace, which in spite of some conditionals favorable to France,\r\nleft the principal and the fatal consequences of the Austro-Burgundian\r\nmarriage to take full effect.  This event marked the stoppage of that\r\ngreat, national policy which had prevailed during the first part of Louis\r\nXI.’s reign.  Joan of Arc and Charles VII. had driven the English from\r\nFrance; and for sixteen years Louis XI. had, by fighting and gradually\r\ndestroying the great vassals who made alliance with them, prevented them\r\nfrom regaining a footing there.  That was work as salutary as it was\r\nglorious for the nation and the French kingship.  At the death of Charles\r\nthe Rash, the work was accomplished; Louis XI. was the only power left in\r\nFrance, without any great peril from without, and without any great rival\r\nwithin; but he then fell under the sway of mistaken ideas and a vicious\r\nspirit.  The infinite resources of his mind, the agreeableness of his\r\nconversation, his perseverance combined with the pliancy of his will, the\r\nservices he was rendering France, the successes he in the long ruin\r\nfrequently obtained, and his ready apparent resignation under his\r\nreverses, for a while made up for or palliated his faults, his\r\nfalsehoods, his perfidies, his iniquities; but when evil is predominant\r\nat the bottom of a man’s soul, he cannot do without youth and success;\r\nhe cannot make head against age and decay, reverse of fortune and the\r\napproach of death; and so Louis XI. when old in years, master-power still\r\nthough beaten in his last game of policy, appeared to all as he really\r\nwas and as he had been prediscerned to be by only such eminent observers\r\nas Commynes, that is, a crooked, swindling, utterly selfish, vindictive,\r\ncruel man.  Not only did he hunt down implacably the men who, after\r\nhaving served him, had betrayed or deserted him; he revelled in the\r\nvengeance he took and the sufferings he inflicted on them.  He had raised\r\nto the highest rank both in state and church the son of a cobbler, or,\r\naccording to others, of a tailor, one John de Balue, born in 1421, at the\r\nmarket-town of Angles, in Poitou.  After having chosen him, as an\r\nintelligent and a clever young priest, for his secretary and almoner,\r\nLouis made him successively clerical councillor in the parliament of\r\nParis, then Bishop of Evreux, and afterwards cardinal; and he employed\r\nhim in his most private affairs.  It was a hobby of his thus to make the\r\nfortunes of men born in the lowest stations, hoping that, since they\r\nwould owe everything to him, they would never depend on any but him.  It\r\nis scarcely credible that so keen and contemptuous a judge of human\r\nnature could have reckoned on dependence as a pledge of fidelity.  And in\r\nthis case Louis was, at any rate, mistaken; Balue was a traitor to him,\r\nand in 1468, at the very time of the incident at Peronne, he was secretly\r\nin the service of Duke Charles of Burgundy, and betrayed to him the\r\ninterests and secrets of his master and benefactor.  In 1469 Louis\r\nobtained material proof of the treachery; and he immediately had Balue\r\narrested and put on his trial.  The cardinal confessed everything, asking\r\nonly to see the king.  Louis gave him an interview on the way from\r\nAmboise to Notre-Dame de Clery; and they were observed, it is said,\r\nconversing for two hours, as they walked together on the road.  The trial\r\nand condemnation of a cardinal by a civil tribunal was a serious business\r\nwith the court of Rome.  The king sent commissioners to Pope Paul II.:\r\nthe pope complained of the procedure, but amicably and without\r\npersistence.  The cardinal was in prison at Loches; and Louis resolved to\r\nleave him there forever, without any more fuss.  But at the same time\r\nthat, out of regard for the dignity of cardinal, which he had himself\r\nrequested of the pope for the culprit, he dispensed with the legal\r\ncondemnation to capital punishment, he was bent upon satisfying his\r\nvengeance, and upon making Balue suffer in person for his crime.  He\r\ntherefore had him confined in a cage, “eight feet broad,” says Commynes,\r\n“and only one foot higher than a man’s stature, covered with iron plates\r\noutside and inside, and fitted with terrible bars.”  There is still to be\r\nseen in Loches castle, under the name of the Balue cage, that instrument\r\nof prison-torture which the cardinal, it is said, himself invented.  In\r\nit he passed eleven years, and it was not until 1480 that he was let out,\r\nat the solicitation of Pope Sixtus IV., to whom Louis XI., being old and\r\nill, thought he could not possibly refuse this favor.  He remembered,\r\nperhaps, at that time how that, sixteen years before, in writing to his\r\nlieutenant-general in Poitou to hand over to Balue, Bishop of Evreux, the\r\nproperty of a certain abbey, he said, “He is a devilish good bishop just\r\nnow; I know not what he will be here-after.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Balue Cage----245]\r\n\r\nHe was still more pitiless towards a man more formidable and less\r\nsubordinate, both in character and origin, than Cardinal Balue.  Louis of\r\nLuxembourg, Count of St. Pol, had been from his youth up engaged in the\r\nwars and intrigues of the sovereigns and great feudal lords of Western\r\nEurope--France, England, Germany, Burgundy, Brittany, and Lorraine.  From\r\n1433 to 1475 he served and betrayed them all in turn, seeking and\r\nobtaining favors, incurring and braving rancor, at one time on one side\r\nand at another time on another, acting as constable of France and as\r\ndiplomatic agent for the Duke of Burgundy, raising troops and taking\r\ntowns for Louis XI., for Charles the Rash, for Edward IV., for the German\r\nemperor, and trying nearly always to keep for himself what he had taken\r\non another’s account.  The truth is, that he was constantly occupied with\r\nthe idea of making for himself an independent dominion, and becoming a\r\ngreat sovereign.  “He was,” says Duclos, “powerful from his possessions,\r\na great captain, more ambitious than politic, and, from his ingratitude\r\nand his perfidies, worthy of his tragic end.”  His various patrons grew\r\ntired at last of being incessantly taken up with and then abandoned,\r\nserved and then betrayed; and they mutually interchanged proofs of the\r\ndesertions and treasons to which they had been victims.  In 1475 Louis\r\nof Luxembourg saw a storm threatening; and he made application for a\r\nsafe-conduct to Charles the Rash, who had been the friend of his youth.\r\n“Tell him,” replied Charles to the messenger, “that he has forfeited his\r\npaper and his hope as well;” and he gave orders to detain him.  As soon\r\nas Louis XI. knew whither the constable had retired, he demanded of the\r\nDuke of Burgundy to give him up, as had been agreed between them.  “I\r\nhave need,” said he, “for my heavy business, of a head like his;” and he\r\nadded, with a ghastly smile, “it is only the head I want; the body may\r\nstay where it is.”  On the 24th of November, 1475, the constable was,\r\naccordingly, given up to the king; and on the 27th, was brought to Paris.\r\nHis trial, begun forthwith, was soon over; he himself acknowledged the\r\ngreater part of what was imputed to him; and on the 19th of December he\r\nwas brought up from the Bastille before the parliament.  “My lord of St.\r\nPol,” said the chancellor to him, “you have always passed for being the\r\nfirmest lord in the realm; you must not belie yourself to-day, when you\r\nhave more need than ever of firmness and courage;” and he read to him the\r\ndecree which sentenced him to lose his head that very day on the Place de\r\nGreve.  “That is a mighty hard sentence,” said the constable; “I pray God\r\nthat I may see Him to-day.”  And he underwent execution with serene and\r\npious firmness.  He was of an epoch when the most criminal enterprises\r\ndid not always preclude piety.  Louis XI. did not look after the\r\nconstable’s accomplices.  “He flew at the heads,” says Duclos, “and was\r\nset on making great examples; he was convinced that noble blood, when it\r\nis guilty, should be shed rather than common blood.  Nevertheless there\r\nwas considered to be something indecent in the cession by the king to the\r\nDuke of Burgundy of the constable’s possessions.  It seemed like the\r\nprice of the blood of an unhappy man, who, being rightfully sacrificed\r\nonly to justice and public tranquillity, appeared to be so to vengeance,\r\nambition, and avarice.”\r\n\r\nIn August, 1477, the battle of Nancy had been fought; Charles the Rash\r\nhad been killed; and the line of the Dukes of Burgundy had been\r\nextinguished.  Louis XI. remained master of the battle-field on which the\r\ngreat risks and great scenes of his life had been passed through.  It\r\nseemed as if he ought to fear nothing now, and that the day for clemency\r\nhad come.  But such was not the king’s opinion; two cruel passions,\r\nsuspicion and vengeance, had taken possession of his soul; he remained\r\nconvinced, not without reason, that nearly all the great feudal lords who\r\nhad been his foes were continuing to conspire against him, and that he\r\nought not, on his side, ever to cease from striving against thorn.  The\r\ntrial of the constable, St. Pol, had confirmed all his suspicions; he had\r\ndiscovered thereby traces and almost proofs of a design for a long time\r\npast conceived and pursued by the constable and his associates--the\r\ndesign of seizing the king, keeping him prisoner, and setting his son,\r\nthe _dauphin_, on the throne, with a regency composed of a council of\r\nlords.  Amongst the declared or presumed adherents of this project, the\r\nking had found James d’Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, the companion and\r\nfriend of his youth; for his father, the Count of Pardiac, had been\r\ngovernor to Louis, at that time _dauphin_.  Louis, on becoming king, had\r\nloaded James d’Armagnac with favors; had raised his countship of Nemours\r\nto a duchy-peerage of France; had married him to Louise of Anjou,\r\ndaughter of the Count of Maine and niece of King Rend.  The new Duke of\r\nNemours entered, nevertheless, into the League of Common Weal against the\r\nking.  Having been included, in 1465, with the other chiefs of the league\r\nin the treaty of Conflans, and reconciled with the king, the Duke of\r\nNemours made oath to him, in the Sainte-Chapelle, to always be to him a\r\ngood, faithful, and loyal subject, and thereby obtained the governorship\r\nof Paris and Ile-de-France.  But, in 1469, he took part in the revolt of\r\nhis cousin, Count John d’Armagnac, who was supposed to be in\r\ncommunication with the English; and having been vanquished by the Count\r\nde Dampmartin, he had need of a fresh pardon from the king, which he\r\nobtained on renouncing the privileges of the peerage if he should offend\r\nagain.  He then withdrew within his own domains, and there lived in\r\ntranquillity and popularity, but still keeping up secret relations with\r\nhis old associates, especially with the Duke of Burgundy and the\r\nconstable of St. Pol.  In 1476, during the Duke of Burgundy’s first\r\ncampaign against the Swiss, the more or less active participation of the\r\nDuke of Nemours with the king’s enemies appeared to Louis so grave, that\r\nhe gave orders to his son-in-law, Peter of Bourbon, Sire de Beaujeu, to\r\ngo and besiege him in his castle of Carlat, in Auvergne.  The Duke of\r\nNemours was taken prisoner there and carried off to Vienne, in Dauphiny,\r\nwhere the king then happened to be.  In spite of the prisoner’s\r\nentreaties, Louis absolutely refused to see him, and had him confined in\r\nthe tower of Pierre-Encise.  The Duke of Nemours was so disquieted at his\r\nposition and the king’s wrath, that his wife, Louise of Anjou, who was in\r\nher confinement at Carlat, had a fit of terror and died there; and he\r\nhimself, shut up at Pierre-Encise, in a dark and damp dungeon, found his\r\nhair turn white in a few days.  He was not mistaken about the gravity of\r\nthe danger.  Louis was both alarmed at these incessantly renewed\r\nconspiracies of the great lords and vexed at the futility of his pardons.\r\nHe was determined to intimidate his enemies by a grand example, and\r\navenge his kingly self-respect by bringing his power home to the ingrates\r\nwho made no account of his indulgence.  He ordered that the Duke of\r\nNemours should be removed from Pierre-Encise to Paris, and put in the\r\nBastille, where he arrived on the 4th of August, 1476, and that\r\ncommissioners should set about his trial.  The king complained of the\r\ngentleness with which the prisoner had been treated on arrival, and wrote\r\nto one of the commissioners, “It seems to me that you have but one thing\r\nto do; that is, to find out what guarantees the Duke of Nemours had given\r\nthe constable of being at one with him in making the Duke of Burgundy\r\nregent, putting me to death, seizing my lord the _dauphin_, and taking\r\nthe authority and government of the realm.  He must he made to speak\r\nclearly on this point, and must get hell (be put to the torture) in good\r\nearnest.  I am not pleased at what you tell me as to the irons having\r\nbeen taken off his legs, as to his being let out from his cage, and as to\r\nhis being taken to the mass to which the women go.  Whatever the\r\nchancellor or others may say, take care that he budge not from his cage,\r\nthat he be never let out save to give him hell (torture him), and that he\r\nsuffer hell (torture) in his own chamber.”  The Duke of Nemours protested\r\nagainst the choice of commissioners, and claimed, as a peer of the realm,\r\nhis right to be tried by the parliament.  When put to the torture he\r\nended by saying, “I wish to conceal nothing from the king; I will tell\r\nhim the truth as to all I know.”  “My most dread and sovereign lord,” he\r\nhimself wrote to Louis, “I have been so misdoing towards you and towards\r\nGod that I quite see that I am undone unless your grace and pity be\r\nextended to me; the which, accordingly, most humbly and in great\r\nbitterness and contrition of heart, I do beseech you to bestow upon me\r\nliberally;” and he put the simple signature, “Poor James.”  “He confessed\r\nthat he had been cognizant of the constable’s designs; but he added that,\r\nwhilst thanking him for the kind offers made to himself, and whilst\r\ntestifying his desire that the lords might at last get their guarantees,\r\nhe had declared what great obligations and great oaths he was under to\r\nthe king, against the which he would not go; he, moreover, had told the\r\nconstable he had no money at the moment to dispose of, no relative to\r\nwhom he was inclined to trust himself or whom he could exert himself to\r\nwin over, not even M. d’Albret, his cousin.”  In such confessions there\r\nwas enough to stop upright and fair judges from the infliction of capital\r\npunishment, but not enough to reassure and move the heart of Louis XI.\r\nOn the chancellor’s representations he consented to have the business\r\nsent before the parliament; but the peers of the realm were not invited\r\nto it.  The king summoned the parliament to Noyon, to be nearer his own\r\nresidence; and he ordered that the trial should be brought to a\r\nconclusion in that town, and that the original commissioners who had\r\ncommenced proceedings, as well as thirteen other magistrates and officers\r\nof the king denoted by their posts, should sit with the lords of the\r\nparliament, and deliberate with them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of so many arbitrary precautions and violations of justice, the\r\nwill of Louis XI. met, even in a parliament thus distorted, with some\r\nresistance.  Three of the commissioners added to the court abstained from\r\ntaking any part in the proceedings; three of the councillors pronounced\r\nagainst the penalty of death; and the king’s own son-in-law, Sire de\r\nBeaujeu, who presided, confined himself to collecting the votes without\r\ndelivering an opinion, and to announcing the decision.  It was to the\r\neffect that “James d’Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, was guilty of high\r\ntreason, and, as such, deprived of all honors, dignities, and\r\nprerogatives, and sentenced to be beheaded and executed according to\r\njustice.”  Furthermore the court declared all his possessions confiscated\r\nand lapsed to the king.  The sentence, determined upon at Noyon on the\r\n10th of July, 1477, was made known to the Duke of Nemours on the 4th of\r\nAugust, in the Bastille, and carried out, the same day, in front of the\r\nmarket-place.  A disgusting detail, reproduced by several modern writers,\r\nhas almost been received into history.  Louis XI., it is said, ordered\r\nthe children of the Duke of Nemours to be placed under the scaffold, and\r\nbe sprinkled with their father’s blood.  None of his contemporaries, even\r\nthe most hostile to Louis XI., and even amongst those who, at the states-\r\ngeneral held in 1484, one of them after his death, raised their voices\r\nagainst the trial of the Duke of Nemours, and in favor of his children,\r\nhas made any mention of this pretended atrocity.  Amongst the men who\r\nhave reigned and governed ably, Louis XI. is one of those who could be\r\nmost justly taxed with cruel indifference when cruelty might be useful to\r\nhim; but the more ground there is for severe judgment upon the chieftains\r\nof nations, the stronger is the interdict against overstepping the limit\r\njustified and authorized by facts.\r\n\r\nThe same rule of historical equity makes it incumbent upon us to remark\r\nthat, in spite of his feelings of suspicion and revenge, Louis XI. could\r\nperfectly well appreciate the men of honor in whom he was able to have\r\nconfidence, and would actually confide in them even contrary to ordinary\r\nprobabilities.  He numbered amongst his most distinguished servants\r\nthree men who had begun by serving his enemies, and whom he conquered,\r\nso to speak, by his penetration and his firm mental grasp of policy.\r\nThe first was Philip of Chabannes, Count de Dampmartin, an able and\r\nfaithful military leader under Charles VII., so suspected by Louis XI.\r\nat his accession, that, when weary of living in apprehension and\r\nretirement he came, in 1463, and presented himself to the king, who was\r\non his way to Bordeaux, “Ask you justice or mercy?” demanded Louis.\r\n“Justice, sir,” was the answer. “Very well, then,” replied the king,\r\n“I banish you forever from the kingdom.”  And he issued an order to that\r\neffect, at the same time giving Dampmartin a large sum to supply the\r\nwants of exile.  It is credible that Louis already knew the worth of the\r\nman, and wished in this way to render their reconciliation more easy.\r\nThree years afterwards, in 1466, he restored to Dampmartin his\r\npossessions together with express marks of royal favor, and twelve years\r\nlater, in 1478, in spite of certain gusts of doubt and disquietude which\r\nhad passed across his mind as to Dampmartin under circumstances critical\r\nfor both of them, the king wrote to him, “Sir Grand Master, I have\r\nreceived your letters, and I do assure you, by the faith of my body,\r\nthat I am right joyous that you provided so well for your affair at\r\nQuesnoy, for one would have said that you and the rest of the old ones\r\nwere no longer any good in an affair of war, and we and the rest of the\r\nyoung ones would have gotten the honor for ourselves. Search, I pray\r\nyou, to the very roots the case of those who would have betrayed us, and\r\npunish them so well that they shall never do you harm. I have always\r\ntold you that you have no need to ask me for leave to go and do your\r\nbusiness, for I am sure that you would not abandon mine without having\r\nprovided for everything.  Wherefore, I put myself in your hands, and you\r\ncan go away without leave.  All goes well; and I am much better pleased\r\nat your holding your own so well than if you had risked a loss of two to\r\none.  And so, farewell!”  In 1465, another man of war, Odet d’Aydie,\r\nLord of Lescun in Warn, had commanded at Montlhery the troops of the\r\nDukes of Berry and Brittany against Louis XI.; and, in 1469, the king,\r\nwho had found means of making his acquaintance, and who “was wiser,”\r\n says Commynes, “in the conduct of such treaties than any other prince of\r\nhis time,” resolved to employ him in his difficult relations with his\r\nbrother Charles, then Duke of Guienne, “promising him that he and his\r\nservants, and he especially, should profit thereby.” Three years\r\nafterwards, in 1472, Louis made Lescun Count of Comminges, “wherein he\r\nshowed good judgment,” adds Commynes, “saying that no peril would come\r\nof putting in his hands that which he did put, for never, during those\r\npast dissensions, had the said Lescun a mind to have any communication\r\nwith the English, or to consent that the places of Normandy should be\r\nhanded over to them;” and to the end of his life Louis XI. kept up the\r\nconfidence which Lescun had inspired by his judicious fidelity in the\r\ncase of this great question.  There is no need to make any addition to\r\nthe name of Philip de Commynes, the most precious of the politic\r\nconquests made by Louis in the matter of eminent counsellors, to whom he\r\nremained as faithful as they were themselves faithful and useful to him.\r\nThe _Memoires of Commynes_ are the most striking proof of the rare and\r\nunfettered political intellect placed by the future historian at the\r\nking’s service, and of the estimation in which the king had wit enough\r\nto hold it.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. rendered to France, four centuries ago, during a reign of\r\ntwenty-two years, three great services, the traces and influence of which\r\nexist to this day.  He prosecuted steadily the work of Joan of Arc and\r\nCharles VII., the expulsion of a foreign kingship and the triumph of\r\nnational independence and national dignity.  By means of the provinces\r\nwhich he successively won, wholly or partly, Burgundy, Franche-Comte,\r\nArtois, Provence, Anjou, Roussillon, and Barrois, he caused France to\r\nmake a great stride towards territorial unity within her natural\r\nboundaries.  By the defeat he inflicted on the great vassals, the favor\r\nhe showed the middle classes, and the use he had the sense to make of\r\nthis new social force, he contributed powerfully to the formation of the\r\nFrench nation, and to its unity under a national government.  Feudal\r\nsociety had not an idea of how to form itself into a nation, or\r\ndiscipline its forces under one head; Louis XI. proved its political\r\nweakness, determined its fall, and labored to place in its stead France\r\nand monarchy.  Herein are the great facts of his reign, and the proofs of\r\nhis superior mind.\r\n\r\nBut side by side with these powerful symptoms of a new regimen appeared\r\nalso the vices of which that regimen contained the germ, and those of the\r\nman himself who was laboring to found it.  Feudal society, perceiving\r\nitself to be threatened, at one time attacked Louis XI. with passion, at\r\nanother entered into violent disputes against him; and Louis, in order to\r\nstruggle with it, employed all the practices, at one time crafty and at\r\nanother violent, that belong to absolute power.  Craft usually\r\npredominated in his proceedings, violence being often too perilous\r\nfor him to risk it; he did not consider himself in a condition to say\r\nbrazen-facedly, “Might before right;” but he disregarded right in the\r\ncase of his adversaries, and he did not deny himself any artifice, any\r\nlie, any baseness, however specious, in order to trick them or ruin them\r\nsecretly, when he did not feel himself in a position to crush them at a\r\nblow.  “The end justifies the means”--that was his maxim; and the end,\r\nin his case, was sometimes a great and legitimate political object,\r\nnothing less than the dominant interest of France, but far more often his\r\nown personal interest, something necessary to his own success or his own\r\ngratification.  No loftiness, no greatness of soul, was natural to him;\r\nand the more experience of life he had, the more he became selfish and\r\ndevoid of moral sense and of sympathy with other men, whether rivals,\r\ntools, or subjects.  All found out before long, not only how little\r\naccount he made of them, but also what cruel pleasure he sometimes took\r\nin making them conscious of his disdain and his power.  He was\r\n“familiar,” but not by no means “vulgar;” he was in conversation able and\r\nagreeable, with a mixture, however, of petulance and indiscretion, even\r\nwhen he was meditating some perfidy; and “there is much need,” he used to\r\nsay, “that my tongue should sometimes serve me; it has hurt me often\r\nenough.”  The most puerile superstitions, as well as those most akin to a\r\nblind piety, found their way into his mind.  When he received any bad\r\nnews, he would cast aside forever the dress he was wearing when the news\r\ncame; and of death he had a dread which was carried to the extent of\r\npusillanimity and ridiculousness.  “Whilst he was every day,” says M. de\r\nBarante, “becoming more suspicious, more absolute, more terrible to his\r\nchildren, to the princes of the blood, to his old servants, and to his\r\nwisest counsellors, there was one man who, without any fear of his wrath,\r\ntreated him with brutal rudeness.  This was James Cattier, his doctor.\r\nWhen the king would sometimes complain of it before certain confidential\r\nservants, ‘I know very well,’ Cattier would say, that some fine morning\r\nyou’ll send me where you’ve sent so many others; but, ‘sdeath, you’ll not\r\nlive a week after!’”  Then the king would coax him, overwhelm him with\r\ncaresses, raise his salary to ten thousand crowns a month, make him a\r\npresent of rich lordships; and he ended by making him premier president\r\nof the Court of Exchequer.  All churches and all sanctuaries of any small\r\ncelebrity were recipients of his oblations, and it was not the salvation\r\nof his soul, but life and health, that he asked for in return.  One day\r\nthere was being repeated, on his account and in his presence, an orison\r\nto St. Eutropius, who was implored to grant health to the soul and health\r\nto the body.  “The latter will be enough,” said the king; “it is not\r\nright to bother the saint for too many things at once.”  He showed great\r\ndevotion for images which had received benediction, and often had one of\r\nthem sewn upon his hat.  Hawkers used to come and bring them to him; and\r\none day he gave a hundred and sixty livres to a pedler who had in his\r\npack one that had received benediction at Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XI. at his Devotions----255]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been, in the middle ages, the taste and the custom in\r\nrespect of such practices, they were regarded with less respect in the\r\nfifteenth than in the twelfth century, and many people scoffed at the\r\ntrust that Louis XI. placed in them, or doubted his sincerity.\r\n\r\nWhether they were sincere or assumed, the superstitions of Louis XI. did\r\nnot prevent him from appreciating and promoting the progress of\r\ncivilization, towards which the fifteenth century saw the first real\r\ngeneral impulse.  He favored the free development of industry and trade;\r\nhe protected printing, in its infancy, and scientific studies, especially\r\nthe study of medicine; by his authorization, it is said, the operation\r\nfor the stone was tried, for the first time in France, upon a criminal\r\nunder sentence of death, who recovered, and was pardoned; and he welcomed\r\nthe philological scholars who were at this time laboring to diffuse\r\nthrough Western Europe the works of Greek and Roman antiquity.  He\r\ninstituted, at first for his own and before long for the public service,\r\npost-horses and the letter-post within his kingdom.  Towards intellectual\r\nand social movement he had not the mistrust and antipathy of an old,\r\none-grooved, worn-out, unproductive despotism; his kingly despotism was\r\nnew, and, one might almost say, innovational, for it sprang and was\r\ngrowing up from the ruins of feudal rights and liberties which had\r\ninevitably ended in monarchy.  But despotism’s good services are\r\nshort-lived; it has no need to last long before it generates iniquity and\r\ntyranny; and that of Louis XI., in the latter part of his reign, bore its\r\nnatural, unavoidable fruits.  “His mistrust,” says M. de Barante, “became\r\nhorrible, and almost insane; every year he had surrounded his castle of\r\nPlessis with more walls, ditches, and rails.  On the towers were iron\r\nsheds, a shelter from arrows, and even artillery.  More than eighteen\r\nhundred of those planks bristling with nails, called caltrops, were\r\ndistributed over the yonder side of the ditch.  There were every day four\r\nhundred crossbow-men on duty, with orders to fire on whosoever\r\napproached.  Every suspected passer-by was seized, and carried off to\r\nTristan l’Hermite, the provost-marshal.  No great proofs were required\r\nfor a swing on the gibbet, or for the inside of a sack and a plunge in\r\nthe Loire.  .  .  .  Men who, like Sire de Commynes, had been the king’s\r\nservants, and who had lived in his confidence, had no doubt but that he\r\nhad committed cruelties and perpetrated the blackest treachery; still\r\nthey asked themselves whether there had not been a necessity, and whether\r\nhe had not, in the first instance, been the object of criminal\r\nmachinations against which he had to defend himself.  .  .  .  But,\r\nthroughout the kingdom, the multitude of his subjects who had not\r\nreceived kindnesses from him, nor lived in familiarity with him, nor\r\nknown of the ability displayed in his plans, nor enjoyed the wit of his\r\nconversation, judged only by that which came out before their eyes; the\r\nimposts had been made much heavier, without any consent on the part of\r\nthe states-general; the talliages, which under Charles VII. brought in\r\nonly eighteen hundred thousand livres, rose, under Louis XI., to\r\nthirty-seven hundred thousand; the kingdom was ruined, and the people\r\nwere at the last extremity of misery; the prisons were full; none was\r\nsecure of life or property; the greatest in the land, and even the\r\nprinces of the blood, were not safe in their own houses.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected event occurred at this time to give a little more heart to\r\nLouis XI., who was now very ill, and to mingle with his gloomy broodings\r\na gleam of future prospects.  Mary of Burgundy, daughter of Charles the\r\nRash, died at Bruges on the 27th of March, 1482, leaving to her husband,\r\nMaximilian of Austria, a daughter, hardly three years of age, Princess\r\nMarguerite by name, heiress to the Burgundian-Flemish dominions which had\r\nnot come into the possession of the King of France.  Louis, as soon as he\r\nheard the news, conceived the idea and the hope of making up for the\r\nreverse he had experienced five years previously through the marriage of\r\nMary of Burgundy.  He would arrange espousals between his son, the\r\n_dauphin_, Charles, thirteen years old, and the infant princess left by\r\nMary, and thus recover for the crown of France the beautiful domains he\r\nhad allowed to slip from him.  A negotiation was opened at once on the\r\nsubject between Louis, Maximilian, and the estates of Flanders, and, on\r\nthe 23d of December, 1482, it resulted in a treaty, concluded at Arras,\r\nwhich arranged for the marriage, and regulated the mutual conditions.  In\r\nJanuary, 1483, the ambassadors from the estates of Flanders and from\r\nMaximilian, who then for the first time assumed the title of archduke,\r\ncame to France for the ratification of the treaty.  Having been first\r\nreceived with great marks of satisfaction at Paris, they repaired to\r\nPlessis-les-Tours.  Great was their surprise at seeing this melancholy\r\nabode, this sort of prison, into which “there was no admittance save\r\nafter so many formalities and precautions.”  When they had waited a\r\nwhile, they were introduced, in the evening, into a room badly lighted.\r\nIn a dark corner was the king, seated in an arm-chair.  They moved\r\ntowards him; and then, in a weak and trembling voice, but still, as it\r\nseemed, in a bantering tone, Louis asked pardon of the Abbot of St.\r\nPeter of Ghent and of the other ambassadors for not being able to rise\r\nand greet them.  After having heard what they had to say, and having held\r\na short conversation with them, he sent for the Gospels for to make oath.\r\nHe excused himself for being obliged to take the holy volume in his left\r\nhand, for his right was paralyzed and his arm supported in a sling.\r\nThen, holding the volume of the Gospels, he raised it up painfully, and\r\nplacing upon it the elbow of his right arm, he made oath.  Thus appeared\r\nin the eyes of the Flemings that king who had done them so much harm, and\r\nwho was obtaining of them so good a treaty by the fear with which he\r\ninspired them, all dying as he was.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of June following, the infant princess, Marguerite of Austria,\r\nwas brought by a solemn embassy to Paris first, and then, on the 23d of\r\nJune, to Amboise, where her betrothal to the _dauphin_, Charles, was\r\ncelebrated.  Louis XI. did not feel fit for removal to Amboise; and he\r\nwould not even receive at Plessis-les-Tours the new Flemish embassy.\r\nAssuredly neither the king nor any of the actors in this regal scene\r\nforesaw that this marriage, which they with reason looked upon as a\r\ntriumph of French policy, would never be consummated; that, at the\r\nrequest of the court of France, the pope would annul the betrothal; and\r\nthat, nine years after its celebration, in 1492, the Austrian princess,\r\nafter having been brought up at Amboise under the guardianship of the\r\nDuchess of Bourbon, Anne, eldest daughter of Louis XI., would be sent\r\nback to her father, Emperor Maximilian, by her affianced, Charles VIII.,\r\nthen King of France, who preferred to become the husband of a French\r\nprincess with a French province for dowry, Anne, Duchess of Brittany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Views of the Castle of Plessis-les-Tours----258]\r\n\r\nIt was in March, 1481, that Louis XI. had his first attack of that\r\napoplexy, which, after several repeated strokes, reduced him to such a\r\nstate of weakness that in June, 1483, he felt himself and declared\r\nhimself not in a fit state to be present at his son’s betrothal.  Two\r\nmonths afterwards, on the 25th of August, St. Louis’s day, he had a fresh\r\nstroke, and lost all consciousness and speech.  He soon recovered them;\r\nbut remained so weak that he could not raise his hand to his mouth, and,\r\nunder the conviction that he was a dead man, he sent for his son-in-law,\r\nPeter of Bourbon, Sire de Beaujeu; and “Go,” said he, “to Amboise, to the\r\nking, my son; I have intrusted him as well as the government of the\r\nkingdom to your charge and my daughter’s care.  You know all I have\r\nenjoined upon him; watch and see that it be observed.  Let him show favor\r\nand confidence towards those who have done me good service and whom I\r\nhave named to him.  You know, too, of whom he should beware, and who must\r\nnot be suffered to come near him.”  He sent for the chancellor from\r\nParis, and bade him go and take the seals to the king.  “Go to the king,”\r\n he said to the captains of his guards, to his archers, to his huntsmen,\r\nto all his household.  “His speech never failed him after it had come\r\nback to him,” says Commynes, “nor his senses; he was constantly saying\r\nsomething of great sense and never in all his illness, which lasted from\r\nMonday to Saturday evening, did he complain, as do all sorts of folk\r\nwhen they feel ill.  .  .  . “Notwithstanding all those commands he\r\nrecovered heart,” adds Commynes, “and had good hope of escaping.”  In\r\nconversation at odd times with some of his servants, and even with\r\nCommynes himself, he had begged them, whenever they saw that he was very\r\nill, not to mention that cruel word death; he had even made a covenant\r\nwith them, that they should say no more to him than, “Don’t talk much,”\r\n which would be sufficient warning. But his doctor, James Coettier, and\r\nhis barber, Oliver the Devil, whom he had ennobled and enriched under\r\nthe name of Oliver le Daim, did not treat him with so much indulgence.\r\n“They notified his death to him in brief and harsh terms,” says\r\nCommynes; “‘Sir, we must do our duty; have no longer hope in your holy\r\nman of Calabria or in other matters, for assuredly all is over with you;\r\nthink of your soul; there is no help for it.’ ‘I have hope in God that\r\nHe will aid me,’ answered Louis, coldly; ‘peradventure I am not so ill\r\nas you think.’\r\n\r\n“He endured with manly virtue so cruel a sentence,” says Commynes, “and\r\neverything, even to death, more than any man I ever saw die; he spoke as\r\ncoolly as if he had never been ill.”  He gave minute orders about his\r\nfuneral, sepulchre, and tomb.  He would be laid at Notre-Dame de Clery,\r\nand not, like his ancestors, at St. Denis; his statue was to be gilt\r\nbronze, kneeling, face to the altar, head uncovered, and hands clasped\r\nwithin his hat, as was his ordinary custom.  Not having died on the\r\nbattle-field and sword in hand, he would be dressed in hunting-garb,\r\nwith jack-boots, a hunting-horn, slung over his shoulder, his hound\r\nlying beside him, his order of St. Michael round his neck, and his sword\r\nat his side.  As to the likeness, he asked to be represented, not as he\r\nwas in his latter days, bald, bow-backed, and wasted, but as he was in\r\nhis youth and in the vigor of his age, face pretty full, nose aquiline,\r\nhair long, and falling down behind to his shoulders.  After having taken\r\nall these pains about himself after his death, he gave his chief\r\nremaining thoughts to France and his son.  “Orders must be sent,” said\r\nhe, “to M. d’Esquerdes [Philip de Crevecoeur, Baron d’Esquerdes, a\r\ndistinguished warrior, who, after the death of Charles the Rash, had,\r\nthrough the agency of Commynes, gone over to the service of Louis XI.,\r\nand was in command of his army] to attempt no doings as to Calais.  We\r\nhad thought to drive out the English from this the last corner they hold\r\nin the kingdom; but such matters are too weighty; all that business ends\r\nwith me.  M. d’Esquerdes must give up such designs, and come and guard\r\nmy son without budging from his side for at least six months.  Let an\r\nend be put, also, to all our disputes with Brittany, and let this Duke\r\nFrancis be allowed to live in peace without any more causing him trouble\r\nor fear.  This is the way in which we, must now deal with all our\r\nneighbors.  Five or six good years of peace are needful for the kingdom.\r\nMy poor people have suffered too much; they are in great desolation.  If\r\nGod had been pleased to grant me life, I should have put it all to\r\nrights; it was my thought and my desire, let my son be strictly charged\r\nto remain at peace, especially whilst he is so young. At a later time,\r\nwhen he is older, and when the kingdom is in good case, he shall do as\r\nhe pleases about it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XI----260]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, August 30, 1483, between seven and eight in the evening,\r\nLouis XI. expired, saying, “Our Lady of Embrun, my good mistress, have\r\npity upon me; the mercies of the Lord will I sing forever (misericordias\r\nDomini in ceternum cantabo).”\r\n\r\n“It was a great cause of joy throughout the kingdom,” says M. de Barante\r\nwith truth, in his _Histoire des Dues de Bourgogne_: “this moment had\r\nbeen impatiently waited for as a deliverance, and as the ending of so\r\nmany woes and fears.  For a long time past no King of France had been so\r\nheavy on his people or so hated by them.”\r\n\r\nThis was certainly just, and at the same time ungrateful.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. had rendered France great service, but in a manner void of\r\nfrankness, dignity, or lustre; he had made the contemporary generation\r\npay dearly for it by reason of the spectacle he presented of trickery,\r\nperfidy, and vindictive cruelty, and by his arbitrary and tyrannical\r\nexercise of kingly power.  People are not content to have useful service;\r\nthey must admire or love; and Louis XI. inspired France with neither of\r\nthose sentiments.  He has had the good fortune to be described and\r\nappraised, in his own day too, by the most distinguished and independent\r\nof his councillors, Philip de Commynes, and, three centuries afterwards,\r\nby one of the most thoughtful and the soundest intellects amongst the\r\nphilosophers of the eighteenth century, Duclos, who, moreover, had the\r\nadvantage of being historiographer of France, and of having studied the\r\nhistory of that reign in authentic documents.  We reproduce here the two\r\njudgments, the agreement of which is remarkable:--\r\n\r\n“God,” says Commynes, “had created our king more wise, liberal, and full\r\nof manly virtue than the princes who reigned with him and in his day, and\r\nwho were his enemies and neighbors.  In all there was good and evil, for\r\nthey were men; but without flattery, in him were more things appertaining\r\nto the office of king than in any of the rest.  I saw them nearly all,\r\nand knew what they could do.”\r\n\r\n“Louis XI.,” says Duclos, “was far from being without reproach; few\r\nprinces have deserved so much; but it may be said that he was equally\r\ncelebrated for his vices and his virtues, and that, everything being put\r\nin the balance, he was a king.”\r\n\r\nWe will be more exacting than Commynes and Duclos; we will not consent to\r\napply to Louis XI. the words liberal, virtuous, and virtue; he had nor\r\ngreatness of soul, nor uprightness of character, nor kindness of heart;\r\nhe was neither a great king nor a good king; but we may assent to Duclos’\r\nlast word--he was a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.----THE WARS OF ITALY.-- CHARLES VIII.-- 1483-1498.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES VIII.----263]\r\n\r\nLouis XI. had by the queen his wife, Charlotte of Savoy, six children;\r\nthree of them survived him: Charles VIII., his successor; Anne, his\r\neldest daughter, who had espoused Peter of Bourbon, Sire de Beaujeu; and\r\nJoan, whom he had married to the Duke of Orleans, who became Louis XII.\r\nAt their father’s death, Charles was thirteen; Anne twenty-two or\r\ntwenty-three; and Joan nineteen.  According to Charles V.’s decree, which\r\nhad fixed fourteen as the age for the king’s majority, Charles VIII., on\r\nhis accession, was very nearly a major; but Louis XI., with good reason,\r\nconsidered him very far from capable of reigning as yet.  On the other\r\nhand, he had a very high opinion of his daughter Anne, and it was to her\r\nfar more than to Sire de Beaujeu, her husband, that, six days before his\r\ndeath, and by his last instructions, he intrusted the guardian-ship of\r\nhis son, to whom he already gave the title of King, and the government of\r\nthe realm.  They were oral instructions not set forth in or confirmed by\r\nany regular testament; but the words of Louis XI. had great weight, even\r\nafter his death.  Opposition to his last wishes was not wanting.  Louis,\r\nDuke of Orleans, was a natural claimant to the regency; but Anne de\r\nBeaujeu, immediately and without consulting anybody, took up the position\r\nwhich had been intrusted to her by her father, and the fact was accepted\r\nwithout ceasing to be questioned.  Louis XI. had not been mistaken in his\r\nchoice; there was none more fitted than his daughter Anne to continue his\r\npolicy under the reign and in the name of his successor; “a shrewd and\r\nclever woman, if ever there was one,” says Brantome, “and the true image\r\nin everything of King Louis, her father.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anne de Beaujeu----264]\r\n\r\nShe began by acts of intelligent discretion.  She tried, not to subdue by\r\nforce the rivals and malcontents, but to put them in the wrong in the\r\neyes of the public, and to cause embarrassment to themselves by treating\r\nthem with fearless favor.  Her brother-in-law, the Duke of Bourbon, was\r\nvexed at being only in appearance and name the head of his own house; and\r\nshe made him constable of France and lieutenant-general of the kingdom.\r\nThe friends of Duke Louis of Orleans, amongst others his chief confidant,\r\nGeorge of Amboise, Bishop of Montauban, and Count Dunois, son of Charles\r\nVII.’s hero, persistently supported the duke’s rights to the regency; and\r\n_Madame_ (the title Anne de Beaujeu had assumed) made Duke Louis governor\r\nof Ile-de-France and of Champagne, and sent Dunois as governor to\r\nDauphiny.  She kept those of Louis XI.’s advisers for whom the public had\r\nnot conceived a perfect hatred like that felt for their master; and\r\nCommynes alone was set aside, as having received from the late king too\r\nmany personal favors, and as having too much inclination towards\r\nindependent criticism of the new regency.  Two of Louis XI.’s subordinate\r\nand detested servants, Oliver de Daim and John Doyac, were prosecuted,\r\nand one was hanged and the other banished; and his doctor, James Cattier,\r\nwas condemned to disgorge fifty thousand crowns out of the enormous\r\npresents he had received from his patient.  At the same time that she\r\nthus gave some satisfaction to the cravings of popular wrath, Anne de\r\nBeaujeu threw open the prisons, recalled exiles, forgave the people a\r\nquarter of the talliage, cut down expenses by dismissing six thousand\r\nSwiss whom the late king had taken into his pay, re-established some sort\r\nof order in the administration of the domains of the crown, and, in fine,\r\nwhether in general measures or in respect of persons, displayed\r\nimpartiality without paying court, and firmness without using severity.\r\nHere was, in fact, a young and gracious woman who gloried solely in\r\nsigning herself simply Anne of France, whilst respectfully following out\r\nthe policy of her father, a veteran king, able, mistrustful, and\r\npitiless.\r\n\r\nAnne’s discretion was soon put to a great trial.  A general cry was\r\nraised for the convocation of the states-general.  The ambitious hoped\r\nthus to open a road to power; the public looked forward to it for a\r\nreturn to legalized government.  No doubt Anne would have preferred to\r\nremain more free and less responsible in the exercise of her authority;\r\nfor it was still very far from the time when national assemblies could be\r\nconsidered as a permanent power and a regular means of government.  But\r\nAnne and her advisers did not waver; they were too wise and too weak to\r\noppose a great public wish.  The states-general were convoked at Tours\r\nfor the 5th of January, 1484.  On the 15th they met in the great hall of\r\nthe arch-bishop’s palace.  Around the king’s throne sat two hundred and\r\nfifty deputies, whom the successive arrivals of absentees raised to two\r\nhundred and eighty-four.  “France in all its entirety,” says M. Picot,\r\n“found itself, for the first time, represented; Flanders alone sent no\r\ndeputies until the end of the session; but Provence, Roussillon,\r\nBurgundy, and Dauphiny were eager to join their commissioners to the\r\ndelegates from the provinces united from the oldest times to the crown.”\r\n [_Histoire des Etats Generaux_ from 1355 to 1614, by George Picot,\r\nt. i. p. 360.]\r\n\r\nWe have the journal of these states-general drawn up with precision and\r\ndetail by one of the chief actors, John Masselin, canon of and deputy for\r\nRouen, “an eminent speaker,” says a contemporary Norman chronicle, “who\r\ndelivered on behalf of the common weal, in the presence of kings and\r\nprinces, speeches full of elegance.”  We may agree that, compared with\r\nthe pompous pedantry of most speakers of his day, the oratorical style of\r\nJohn Masselin is not without a certain elegance, but that is not his\r\ngreat and his original distinction; what marks him out and gives him so\r\nhigh a place in the history of the fifteenth century, is the judicious\r\nand firm political spirit displayed in his conduct as deputy and in his\r\nnarrative as historian.  [The Journal, written by the author in Latin,\r\nwas translated into French and published, original and translation,\r\nby M. A.  Bernier, in 1835, in the _Collection des Documents inedits\r\nrelatifs d l’Histoire de France._] And it is not John Masselin only, but\r\nthe very assembly itself in which he sat, that appears to us, at the end\r\nof five centuries, seriously moved by a desire for a free government, and\r\nnot far from comprehending and following out the essential conditions of\r\nit.  France had no lack of states-general, full of brilliancy and power,\r\nbetween 1356 and 1789, from the reign of Charles V. to that of\r\nLouis XVI.; but in the majority of these assemblies, for all the\r\nambitious soarings of liberty, it was at one time religious party-spirit\r\nand at another the spirit of revolution that ruled and determined both\r\nacts and events.  Nothing of that kind appeared in the states-general\r\nassembled at Tours in 1484; the assembly was profoundly monarchical, not\r\nonly on general principles, but in respect of the reigning house and the\r\nyoung king seated on the throne.  There was no fierce struggle, either,\r\nbetween the aristocracy and the democracy of the day, between the\r\necclesiastical body and the secular body; although widely differing and\r\nwidely separated, the clergy, the nobility, and the third estate were not\r\nat war, even in their hearts, between themselves.  One and the same idea,\r\none and the same desire, animated the three orders; to such a degree\r\nthat, as has been well pointed out by M. Picot, “in the majority of the\r\ntowns they proceeded in common to the choice of deputies: the clergy,\r\nnobles, and commons who arrived at Tours were not the representatives\r\nexclusively of the clergy, the nobles, or the third estate: they combined\r\nin their persons a triple commission;” and when, after having examined\r\ntogether their different memorials, by the agency of a committee of\r\nthirty-six members taken in equal numbers from the three orders, they\r\ncame to a conclusion to bring their grievances and their wishes before\r\nthe government of Charles VIII., they decided that a single spokesman\r\nshould be commissioned to sum up, in a speech delivered in solemn\r\nsession, the report of the committee of Thirty-six; and it was the canon,\r\nMaster John Masselin, who received the commission to speak in the name of\r\nall.  They all had at heart one and the same idea; they desired to turn\r\nthe old and undisputed monarchy into a legalized and free government.\r\nClergy, nobles, and third estate, there was not in any of their minds any\r\nrevolutionary yearning or any thought of social war.  It is the peculiar\r\nand the beautiful characteristic of the states-general of 1484 that they\r\nhad an eye to nothing but a great political reform, a regimen of legality\r\nand freedom.\r\n\r\nTwo men, one a Norman and the other a Burgundian, the canon John Masselin\r\nand Philip Pot, lord of la Roche, a former counsellor of Philip the Good,\r\nDuke of Burgundy, were the exponents of this political spirit, at once\r\nbold and prudent, conservative and reformative.  The nation’s sovereignty\r\nand the right of the estates not only to vote imposts but to exercise a\r\nreal influence over the choice and conduct of the officers of the crown,\r\nthis was what they affirmed in principle, and what, in fact, they labored\r\nto get established.  “I should like,” said Philip de la Roche, “to see\r\nyou quite convinced that the government of the state is the people’s\r\naffair; and by the people I mean not only the multitude of those who are\r\nsimply subjects of this crown, but indeed all persons of each estate,\r\nincluding the princes also.  Since you consider yourselves deputies from\r\nall the estates of the kingdom, why are you afraid to conclude that you\r\nhave been especially summoned to direct by your counsels the commonwealth\r\nduring its quasi-interregnum caused by the king’s minority?  Far be it\r\nfrom me to say that the reigning, properly so called, the dominion, in\r\nfact, passes into any hands but those of the king; it is only the\r\nadministration, the guardianship of the kingdom, which is conferred for a\r\ntime upon the people or their elect.  Why tremble at the idea of taking\r\nin hand the regulation, arrangement, and nomination of the council of the\r\ncrown?  You are here to say and to advise freely that which, by\r\ninspiration of God and your conscience, you believe to be useful for the\r\nrealm.  What is the obstacle that prevents you from accomplishing so\r\nexcellent and meritorious a work?  I can find none, unless it be your own\r\nweakness and the pusillanimity which causes fear in your minds.  Come,\r\nthen, most illustrious lords, have great confidence in yourselves, have\r\ngreat hopes, have great manly virtue, and let not this liberty of the\r\nestates, that your ancestors were so zealous in defending, be imperilled\r\nby reason of your soft-heartedness.”  “This speech,” says Masselin, “was\r\nlistened to by the whole assembly very attentively and very favorably.”\r\n Masselin, being called upon to give the king “in his privy chamber,\r\nbefore the Dukes of Orleans and Lorraine and a numerous company of\r\nnobles,” an exact account of the estates’ first deliberations, held in\r\nhis turn language more reserved than, but similar to, that of Lord Philip\r\nde la Roche, whose views he shared and whose proud openness he admired.\r\nThe question touching the composition of the king’s council and the part\r\nto be taken in it by the estates was for five weeks the absorbing idea\r\nwith the government and with the assembly.  There were made, on both\r\nsides, concessions which satisfied neither the estates nor the court, for\r\ntheir object was always on the part of the estates to exercise a real\r\ninfluence on the government, and on the part of the court to escape being\r\nunder any real influence of the estates.  Side by side with the question\r\nof the king’s council was ranged that of the imposts; and here it was no\r\neasier to effect an understanding: the crown asked more than the estates\r\nthought they ought or were able to vote; and, after a long and obscure\r\ncontroversy about expenses and receipts, Masselin was again commissioned\r\nto set-before the king’s council the views of the assembly and its\r\nultimate resolution.  “When we saw,” said he, “that the aforesaid\r\naccounts or estimates contained elements of extreme difficulty, and that\r\nto balance and verify them would subject us to interminable discussions\r\nand longer labor than would be to our and the people’s advantage, we\r\nhastened to adopt by way of expedient, but nevertheless resolutely, the\r\ndecision I am about to declare to you.  .  .  .  Wishing to meet\r\nliberally the king’s and your desires, we offer to pay the sum that King\r\nCharles VII. used to take for the impost of talliages, provided, however,\r\nthat this sum be equally and proportionately distributed between the\r\nprovinces of the kingdom, and that in the shape of an aid.  And this\r\ncontribution be only for two years, after which the estates shall be\r\nassembled as they are to-day to discuss the public needs; and if at that\r\ntime or previously they see the advantage thereof, the said sum shall be\r\ndiminished or augmented.  Further, the said my lords the deputies do\r\ndemand that their next meeting be now appointed and declared, and that an\r\nirrevocable decision do fix and decree that assembly.”\r\n\r\nThis was providing at one and the same time for the wants of the present\r\nand the rights of the future.  The impost of talliage was, indeed, voted\r\njust as it had stood under Charles VII., but it became a temporary aid\r\ngranted for two years only; at the end of them the estates were to be\r\nconvoked and the tax augmented or diminished according to the public\r\nwants.  The great question appeared decided; by means of the vote,\r\nnecessary and at the same time temporary, in the case of the impost, the\r\nstates-general entered into real possession of a decisive influence in\r\nthe government; but the behavior and language of the officers of the\r\ncrown and of the great lords of the court rendered the situation as\r\ndifficult as ever.  In a long and confused harangue the chancellor,\r\nWilliam de Rochefort, did not confine himself to declaring the sum voted,\r\ntwelve hundred thousand livres, to be insufficient, and demanding three\r\nhundred thousand livres more; he passed over in complete silence the\r\nlimitation to two years of the tax voted and the requirement that at the\r\nend of that time the states-general should be convoked.  “Whilst the\r\nchancellor was thus speaking,” says Masselin, “many deputies of a more\r\nindependent spirit kept groaning, and all the hall resounded with a\r\nslight murmuring because it seemed that he was not expressing himself\r\nwell as to the power and liberty of the people.”  The deputies asked\r\nleave to deliberate in the afternoon, promising a speedy answer.  “As you\r\nwish to deliberate, do so, but briefly,” said the chancellor; “it would\r\nbe better for you to hold counsel now so as to answer in the afternoon.”\r\n The deputies took their time; and the discussion was a long and a hot\r\none.  “We see quite well how it is,” said the princes and the majority of\r\nthe great lords; “to curtail the king’s power, and pare down his nails to\r\nthe quick, is the object of your efforts; you forbid the subjects to pay\r\ntheir prince as much as the wants of the state require: are they masters,\r\npray, and no longer subjects?  You would set up the laws of some fanciful\r\nmonarchy, and abolish the old ones.”  “I know the rascals,” said one of\r\nthe great lords [according to one historian, it was the Duke of Bourbon,\r\nAnne de Beaujeu’s brother-in-law]; “if they are not kept down by\r\nover-weighting them, they will soon become insolent; for my part, I\r\nconsider this tax the surest curb for holding them in.”  “Strange words,”\r\n says Masselin, “unworthy of utterance from the mouth of a man so eminent;\r\nbut in his soul, as in that of all old men, covetousness had increased\r\nwith age, and he appeared to fear a diminution of his pension.”\r\n\r\nAfter having deliberated upon it, the states-general persisted in their\r\nvote of a tax of twelve hundred thousand livres, at which figure it had\r\nstood under King Charles VII., but for two years only, and as a gift or\r\ngrant, not as a permanent talliage any more, and on condition that at the\r\nend of that time the states should be necessarily convoked.  At the same\r\ntime, however, “and over and above this, the said estates, who do desire\r\nthe well-being, honor, prosperity, and augmentation of the lord king and\r\nof his kingdom, and in order to obey him and please him in all ways\r\npossible, do grant him the sum of three hundred thousand livres of Tours,\r\nfor this once only, and without being a precedent, on account of his late\r\njoyful accession to the throne of France, and for to aid and support the\r\noutlay which it is suitable to make for his holy consecration,\r\ncoronation, and entry into Paris.”\r\n\r\nOn this fresh vote, full of fidelity to the monarchy and at the same time\r\nof patriotic independence, negotiations began between the estates and the\r\ncourt; and they lasted from the 28th of February to the 12th of March,\r\nbut without result.  At bottom, the question lay between absolute power\r\nand free government, between arbitrariness and legality; and, on this\r\nfield, both parties were determined not to accept a serious and final\r\ndefeat.  Unmoved by the loyal concessions and assurances they received,\r\nthe advisers of the crown thought no longer of anything but getting\r\nspeedily rid of the presence of the estates, so as to be free from the\r\ntrouble of maintaining the discussion with them.  The deputies saw\r\nthrough the device; their speeches were stifled, and the necessity of\r\nreplying was eluded.  “My lord chancellor,” said they, at an interview on\r\nthe 2d of March, 1484, “if we are not to have a hearing, why are we here?\r\nWhy have you summoned us?  Let us withdraw.  If you behave thus, you do\r\nnot require our presence.  We did not at all expect to see the fruits of\r\nour vigils, and the decisions adopted after so much trouble by so\r\nillustrious an assembly rejected so carelessly.”  The complaints were not\r\nalways so temperate.  A theologian, whom Masselin quotes without giving\r\nhis name, “a bold and fiery partisan of the people,” says he, added these\r\nalmost insulting words: “As soon as our consent had been obtained for\r\nraising the money, there is no doubt but that we have been cajoled, that\r\neverything has been treated with contempt, the demands set down in our\r\nmemorials, our final resolutions, and the limits we fixed.  Speak we of\r\nthe money.  On this point, our decisions have been conformed to only so\r\nfar as to tell us, ‘This impost shall no longer be called talliage; it\r\nshall be a free grant.’ Is it in words, pray, and not in things, that our\r\nlabor and the well-being of the state consist?  Verily, we would rather\r\nstill call this impost _talliage,_ and even blackmail (_maltote_), or\r\ngive it a still viler name, if there be any, than see it increasing\r\nimmeasurably and crushing the people.  The curse of God and the\r\nexecration of men upon those whose deeds and plots have caused such woes!\r\nThey are the most dangerous foes of the people and of the commonwealth.”\r\n “The theologian burned with a desire to continue,” adds Masselin; “but\r\nthough he had not wandered far from the truth, many deputies chid him and\r\nconstrained him to be silent.  .  .  .  Already lethargy had fallen upon\r\nthe most notable amongst us; glutted with favors and promises, they no\r\nlonger possessed that ardor of will which had animated them at first;\r\nwhen we were prosecuting our business, they remained motionless at home;\r\nwhen we spoke before them, they held their peace or added but a few\r\nfeeble words.  We were wasting our time.”\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, 1484, the deputies from Normandy, twenty-five in\r\nnumber, happened to hold a meeting at Montils-les-Tours.  The Bishop of\r\nCoutances told them that there was no occasion for the estates to hold\r\nany more meetings; that it would be enough if each of the six sections\r\nappointed three or four delegates to follow the course of affairs; and\r\nthat, moreover, the compensation granted to all the deputies of the\r\nestates would cease on the 14th of March, and after that would be granted\r\nonly to their delegates.  This compensation had already, amongst the\r\nestates, been the subject of a long discussion.  The clergy and the\r\nnobility had attempted to throw the whole burden of it upon the third\r\nestate; the third estate had very properly claimed that each of the three\r\norders should, share proportionately in this expense, and the chancellor\r\nhad with some difficulty got it decided that the matter should stand so.\r\nOn the 14th of March, accordingly, the six sections of the estates met\r\nand elected three or four deputies apiece.  The deputies were a little\r\nsurprised, on entering their sessions-hall, to find it completely\r\ndismantled: carpets, hangings, benches, table, all had been removed,\r\nso certainly did the government consider the session over.  Some members,\r\nin disgust, thought and maintained that the estates ought not to separate\r\nwithout carrying away with them the resolutions set down in their general\r\nmemorial, formally approved and accompanied by an order to the judges to\r\nhave them executed.  “But a much larger number,” says Masselin, “were\r\nafraid of remaining too long, and many of our colleagues, in spite of the\r\nzeal which they had once shown, had a burning desire to depart, according\r\nto the princes’ good pleasure and orders.  As for us, we enjoined upon\r\nthe three deputies of our Norman nationality not to devote themselves\r\nsolely to certain special affairs which had not yet been terminated, but\r\nto use redoubled care and diligence in all that concerned the general\r\nmemorial and the aggregate of the estates.  And having thus left our\r\ncommissioners at Tours and put matters to rights, we went away well\r\ncontent; and we pray God that our labors and all that has been done may\r\nbe useful for the people’s welfare.”\r\n\r\nNeither Masselin nor his descendants for more than three centuries were\r\ndestined to see the labors of the states-general of 1484 obtain\r\nsubstantial and durable results.  The work they had conceived and\r\nattempted was premature.  The establishment of a free government demands\r\neither spontaneous and simple virtues, such as may be found in a young\r\nand small community, or the lights, the scientific method, and the\r\nwisdom, painfully acquired and still so imperfect, of great and civilized\r\nnations.  France of the fifteenth century was in neither of these\r\nconditions.  But it is a crown of glory to have felt that honest and\r\npatriotic ambition which animated Masselin and his friends at their\r\nexodus from the corrupt and corrupting despotism of Louis XI.  Who would\r\ndare to say that their attempt, vain as it was for them, was so also for\r\ngenerations separated from them by centuries?  Time and space are as\r\nnothing in the mysterious development of God’s designs towards men, and\r\nit is the privilege of mankind to get instruction and example from\r\nfar-off memories of their own history.  It was a duty to render to the\r\nstates-general of 1484 the homage to which they have a right by reason of\r\ntheir intentions and their efforts on behalf of the good cause and in\r\nspite of their unsuccess.\r\n\r\nWhen the states-general had separated, Anne de Beaujeu, without\r\ndifficulty or uproar, resumed, as she had assumed on her father’s death,\r\nthe government of France; and she kept it yet for seven years, from 1484\r\nto 1491.  During all this time she had a rival and foe in Louis, Duke of\r\nOrleans, who was one day to be Louis XII.  “I have heard tell,” says\r\nBrantome, “how that, at the first, she showed affection towards him, nay,\r\neven love; in such sort that, if M. d’Orleans had been minded to give\r\nheed thereto, he might have done well, as I know from a good source; but\r\nhe could not bring himself to it; especially as he found her too\r\nambitious, and he would that she should be dependent on him, as premier\r\nprince and nearest to the throne, and not he on her; whereas she desired\r\nthe contrary, for she was minded to have the high place and rule\r\neverything.  .  .  .  They used to have,” adds Brantome, “prickings of\r\njealousy, love, and ambition.”  If Brantome’s anecdote is true, as one is\r\ninclined to believe, though several historians have cast doubts upon it,\r\nAnne de Beaujeu had, in their prickings of jealousy, love, and ambition,\r\na great advantage over Louis of Orleans.  They were both young, and\r\nexactly of the same age; but Louis had all the defects of youth, whilst\r\nAnne had all the qualities of mature age.  He was handsome, volatile,\r\ninconsiderate, impudent, brave, and of a generous, open nature, combined\r\nwith kindliness; she was thoughtful, judicious, persistent, and probably\r\na little cold and hard, such, in fact, as she must needs have become in\r\nthe school of her father, Louis XI.  As soon as the struggle between them\r\nbegan, the diversity of their characters appeared and bore fruit.  The\r\nDuke of Orleans plunged into all sorts of intrigues and ventures against\r\nthe fair regent, exciting civil war, and, when he was too much\r\ncompromised or too hard pressed, withdrawing to the court of Francis II.,\r\nDuke of Brittany, an unruly vassal of the King of France.  Louis of\r\nOrleans even made alliance, at need, with foreign princes, Henry VII.,\r\nKing of England, Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Arragon, and Maximilian,\r\narchduke of Austria, without much regard for the interests of his own\r\nkingly house and his own country.  Anne, on the contrary, in possession\r\nof official and legal authority, wielded it and guarded it with prudence\r\nand moderation in the interests of France and of the crown, never taking\r\nthe initiative in war, but having the wit to foresee, maintain, and,\r\nafter victory, end it.  She encountered from time to time, at her own\r\ncourt and in her own immediate circle, a serious difficulty: the young\r\nking, Charles, was charmed by the Duke of Orleans’s brilliant qualities,\r\nespecially by the skill and bravery that Louis displayed at tournaments.\r\nOne day, interrupting the Bishop of Montauban, George of Amboise, who was\r\nreading the breviary to him, “Send word to the Duke of Orleans,” said the\r\nking, “to go on with his enterprise, and that I would fain be with him.”\r\n Another day he said to Count Dunois, “Do take me away, uncle: I’m longing\r\nto be out of this company.”  Dunois and George of Amboise, both of them\r\npartisans of the Duke of Orleans, carefully encouraged the king in\r\nsentiments so favorable to the fair regent’s rival.  Incidents of another\r\nsort occurred to still further embarrass the position for Anne de\r\nBeaujeu.  The eldest daughter of Francis II., Duke of Brittany, herself\r\nalso named Anne, would inherit his duchy, and on this ground she was\r\nardently wooed by many competitors.  She was born in 1477; and at four\r\nyears of age, in 1481, she had been promised in marriage to Edward,\r\nPrince of Wales, son of Edward IV., King of England.  But two years\r\nafterwards, in 1483, this young prince was murdered, or, according to\r\nother accounts, imprisoned by his uncle Richard III., who seized the\r\ncrown; and the Breton promise vanished with him.  The number of claimants\r\nto the hand of Anne of Brittany increased rapidly; and the policy of the\r\nduke her father consisted, it was said, in making for himself five or six\r\nsons-in-law by means of one daughter.  Towards the end of 1484, the Duke\r\nof Orleans, having embroiled himself with Anne de Beaujeu, sought refuge\r\nin Brittany; and many historians have said that he not only at that time\r\naspired to the hand of Anne of Brittany, but that he paid her assiduous\r\ncourt and obtained from her marks of tender interest.  Count Darn, in his\r\n_Histoire de Bretagne_ (t. iii. p. 82), has put the falsehood of this\r\nassertion beyond a doubt; the Breton princess was then only seven and the\r\nDuke of Orleans had been eight years married to Joan of France, younger\r\ndaughter of Louis XI.  But in succeeding years and amidst the continual\r\nalternations of war and negotiation between the King of France and the\r\nDuke of Brittany, Anne de Beaujeu and the Duke of Orleans, competition\r\nand strife between the various claimants to the hand of Anne of Brittany\r\nbecame very active; Alan, Sire d’Albret, called the Great because of his\r\nreputation for being the richest lord of the realm, Viscount James de\r\nRohan, and Archduke Maximilian of Austria, all three believed themselves\r\nto have hopes of success, and prosecuted them assiduously.  Sire\r\nd’Albret, a widower and the father of eight children already, was\r\nforty-five, with a pimply face, a hard eye, a hoarse voice, and a\r\nquarrelsome and gloomy temper; and Anne, being pressed to answer his\r\nsuit, finally declared that she would turn nun rather than marry him.\r\nJames de Rohan, in spite of his powerful backers at the court of Rennes,\r\nwas likewise dismissed; his father, Viscount John II., was in the service\r\nof the King of France.  Archduke Maximilian remained the only claimant\r\nwith any pretensions.  He was nine and twenty, of gigantic stature,\r\njustly renowned for valor and ability in war, and of more literary\r\nculture than any of the princes his contemporaries, a trait he had in\r\ncommon with Princess Anne, whose education had been very carefully\r\nattended to.  She showed herself to be favorably disposed towards him;\r\nand the Duke of Orleans, whose name, married though he was, was still\r\nsometimes associated with that of the Breton princess, formally declared,\r\non the 26th of January, 1486, that, “when he came to the Duke of\r\nBrittany’s, it was solely to visit him and advise him on certain points\r\ntouching the defence of his duchy, and not to talk to him of marriage\r\nwith the princesses his daughters.”  But, whilst the negotiation was thus\r\ninclining towards the Austrian prince, Anne de Beaujeu, ever far-sighted\r\nand energetic, was vigorously pushing on the war against the Duke of\r\nBrittany and his allies.  She had found in Louis de la Tremoille an able\r\nand a bold warrior, whom Guicciardini calls the greatest captain in the\r\nworld.  In July, 1488, he came suddenly down upon Brittany, took one\r\nafter the other Chateaubriant, Ancenis, and Fougeres, and, on the 28th,\r\ngained at St. Aubin-du-Cormier, near Rennes, over the army of the Duke of\r\nBrittany and his English, German, and Gascon allies, a victory which\r\ndecided the campaign: six thousand of the Breton army were killed, and\r\nDuke Louis of Orleans, the Prince of Orange, and several French lords,\r\nhis friends, were made prisoners.  On receiving at Angers the news of\r\nthis victory, Charles VIII. gave orders that the two captive princes\r\nshould be brought to him; but Anne de Beaujeu, fearing some ebullition on\r\nhis part of a too prompt and too gratuitous generosity, caused delay in\r\ntheir arrival; and the Duke of Orleans, who was taken first to the castle\r\nof Sable and then to Lusignan, went ultimately to the Tower of Bourges,\r\nwhere he was to await the king’s decision.\r\n\r\nIt was a great success for Anne de Beaujeu.  She had beaten her united\r\nfoes; and the most formidable of them all, the Duke of Orleans, was her\r\nprisoner.  Two incidents that supervened, one a little before and the\r\nother a little after the battle of St. Aubin-du-Cormier, occurred to both\r\nembarrass the position and at the same time call forth all the energy of\r\nAnne.  Her brother-in-law, Duke John of Bourbon, the head of his house,\r\ndied on the 1st of April, 1488, leaving to his younger brother, Peter,\r\nhis title and domains.  Having thus become Duchess of Bourbon, and being\r\nwell content with this elevation in rank and fortune, Madame the Great\r\n(as Anne de Beaujeu was popularly called) was somewhat less eagerly\r\noccupied with the business of the realm, was less constant at the king’s\r\ncouncil, and went occasionally with her husband to stay a while in their\r\nown territories.  Charles VIII., moreover, having nearly arrived at man’s\r\nestate, made more frequent manifestations of his own personal will; and\r\nAnne, clear-sighted and discreet though ambitious, was little by little\r\nchanging her dominion into influence.  But some weeks after the battle of\r\nSt. Aubin-du-Cormier, on the 7th or 9th of September, 1488, the death of\r\nFrancis II., Duke of Brittany, rendered the active intervention of the\r\nDuchess of Bourbon natural and necessary; for he left his daughter, the\r\nPrincess Anne, barely eighteen years old, exposed to all the difficulties\r\nattendant upon the government of her inheritance, and to all the\r\nintrigues of the claimants to her hand.  In the summer of 1489, Charles\r\nVIII. and his advisers learned that the Count of Nassau, having arrived\r\nin Brittany with the proxy of Archduke Maximilian, had by a mock ceremony\r\nespoused the Breton princess in his master’s name.  This strange mode of\r\ncelebration could not give the marriage a real and indissoluble\r\ncharacter; but the concern in the court of France was profound.  In\r\nBrittany there was no mystery any longer made about the young duchess’s\r\nengagement; she already took the title of Queen of the Romans.  Charles\r\nVIII. loudly protested against this pretended marriage; and to give still\r\nmore weight to his protest he sent to Henry VII., King of England, who\r\nwas much mixed up with the affairs of Brittany, ambassadors charged to\r\nexplain to him the right which France had to oppose the marriage of the\r\nyoung Duchess with Archduke Maximilian, at the same time taking care not\r\nto give occasion for thinking that Charles had any views on his own\r\naccount in that quarter.  “The king my master,” said the ambassador,\r\n“doth propose to assert by arms his plain rights over the kingdom of\r\nNaples, now occupied by some usurper or other, a bastard of the house of\r\nArragon.  He doth consider, moreover, the conquest of Naples only as a\r\nbridge thrown down before him for to take him into Greece; there he is\r\nresolved to lavish his blood and his treasure, though he should have to\r\npawn his crown and drain his kingdom, for to overthrow the tyranny of the\r\nOttomans, and open to himself in this way the kingdom of Heaven.”  The\r\nKing of England gave a somewhat ironical reply to this chivalrous\r\naddress, merely asking whether the King of France would consent not to\r\ndispose of the heiress of Brittany’s hand, save on the condition of not\r\nmarrying her himself.  The ambassadors shuffled out of the question by\r\nsaying that their master was so far from any such idea, that it had not\r\nbeen foreseen in their instructions.\r\n\r\nWhether it had or had not been foreseen and meditated upon, so soon as\r\nthe reunion of Brittany with France by the marriage of the young duchess,\r\nAnne, with King Charles VIII. appeared on the horizon as a possible, and,\r\nperadventure, probable fact, it became the common desire, aim, and labor\r\nof all the French politicians who up to that time had been opposed,\r\npersecuted, and proscribed.  Since the battle of St. Aubin-du-Cormier,\r\nDuke Louis of Orleans had been a prisoner in the Tower of Bourges, and so\r\nstrictly guarded that he was confined at night in an iron cage like\r\nCardinal Balue’s for fear he should escape.  In vain had his wife, Joan\r\nof France, an unhappy and virtuous princess, ugly and deformed, who had\r\nnever been able to gain her husband’s affections, implored her\r\nall-powerful sister, Anne of Bourbon, to set him at liberty: “As I am\r\nincessantly thinking,” she wrote to her, “about my husband’s release, I\r\nhave conceived the idea of setting down in writing the fashion in which\r\npeace might be had, and my said husband be released.  I am writing it out\r\nfor the king, and you will see it all.  I pray you, sister, to look to it\r\nthat I may get a few words in answer; it has been a very sad thing for me\r\nthat I never see you now.”  There is no trace of any answer from Anne to\r\nher sister.  Charles VIII. had a heart more easily touched.  When Joan,\r\nin mourning, came and threw herself at his feet, saying, “Brother, my\r\nhusband is dragging on his life in prison; and I am in such trouble that\r\nI know not what I ought to say in his defence.  If he has had aught\r\nwherewith to reproach himself, I am the only one whom he has outraged.\r\nPardon him, brother; you will never have so happy a chance of being\r\ngenerous.”  “You shall have him, sister,” said Charles, kissing her;\r\n“grant Heaven that you may not repent one day of that which you are doing\r\nfor him to-day!”  Some days after this interview, in May, 1491, Charles,\r\nwithout saying anything about it to the duchess, Anne of Bourbon, set off\r\none evening from Plessis du Pare on pretence of going a-hunting, and on\r\nreaching Berry sent for the Duke of Orleans from the Tower of Bourges.\r\nLouis, in raptures at breathing the air of freedom, at the farthest\r\nglimpse he caught of the king, leaped down from his horse and knelt,\r\nweeping, on the ground.  “Charles,” says the chronicler, “sprang upon his\r\nneck, and knew not what cheer (reception) to give him, to make it\r\nunderstood that he was acting of his own motion and free will.”  Charles\r\nill understood his sister Anne, and could scarcely make her out.  But two\r\nconvictions had found their way into that straightforward and steady mind\r\nof hers; one, that a favorable time had arrived for uniting Brittany with\r\nFrance, and must be seized; the other, that the period of her personal\r\ndominion was over, and that all she had to do was to get herself well\r\nestablished in her new position.  She wrote to the king her brother to\r\nwarn him against the accusations and wicked rumors of which she might\r\npossibly be the object.  He replied to her on the 21st of June, 1491:\r\n“My good sister, my dear, Louis de Pesclins has informed me that you have\r\nknowledge that certain matters have been reported to me against you;\r\nwhereupon I answered him that nought of the kind had been reported to me;\r\nand I assure you that none would dare so to speak to me; for, in\r\nwhatsoever fashion it might, I would not put faith therein, as I hope to\r\ntell you when we are together,--bidding you adieu, my good sister, my\r\ndear.”  After having re-assured his sister, Charles set about reconciling\r\nher, as well as her husband, the Duke of Bourbon, with her\r\nbrother-in-law, the Duke of Orleans.  Louis, who was of a frank and by no\r\nmeans rancorous disposition, as he himself said and proved at a later\r\nperiod, submitted with a good grace; and on the 4th of September, 1491,\r\nat La Fleche, the princes jointly made oath, by their baptism and with\r\ntheir hands on the book of the Gospels, “to hold one another once more in\r\nperpetual affection, and to forget all old rancor, hatred, and ill will,\r\nfor to well and loyally serve King Charles, guard his person and\r\nauthority, and help him to comfort the people, and set in order his\r\nhousehold and his kingdom.”  Councillors and servants were included in\r\nthis reconciliation of the masters; and Philip de Commynes and the Bishop\r\nof Montauban, ere long Archbishop of Rouen, Governor of Normandy, and\r\nCardinal d’Amboise, went out of disgrace, took their places again in the\r\nking’s councils, and set themselves loyally to the work of accomplishing\r\nthat union between Charles VIII. and Anne of Brittany, whereby France was\r\nto achieve the pacific conquest of Brittany.\r\n\r\nPacific as it was, this conquest cost some pains, and gave some trouble.\r\nIn person Charles VIII. was far from charming; he was short and badly\r\nbuilt; he had an enormous head; great, blank-looking eyes; an aquiline\r\nnose, bigger and thicker than was becoming; thick lips, too, and\r\neverlastingly open; nervous twitchings, disagreeable to see; and slow\r\nspeech.  “In my judgment,” adds the ambassador from Venice, Zachary\r\nContarini, who had come to Paris in May, 1492, “I should hold that, body\r\nand mind, he is not worth much; however, they all sing his praises in\r\nParis as a right lusty gallant at playing of tennis, and at hunting, and\r\nat jousting, exercises to the which, in season and out of season, he doth\r\ndevote a great deal of time.”  The same ambassador says of Anne of\r\nBrittany, who had then been for four months Queen of France, “The queen\r\nis short also, thin, lame of one foot, and perceptibly so, though she\r\ndoes what she can for herself by means of boots with high heels, a\r\nbrunette and very pretty in the face, and, for her age, very knowing; in\r\nsuch sort that what she has once taken into her head she will obtain\r\nsomehow or other, whether it be smiles or tears that be needed for it.”\r\n --[_La Diplomatic Venitienne au Seizieme Siecle,_ by M. Armand Baschet,\r\np. 325 (Paris, 1862).]  Knowing as she was, Anne was at the same time\r\nproud and headstrong; she had a cultivated mind; she was fond of the\r\narts, of poetry, and of ancient literature; she knew Latin, and even a\r\nlittle Greek; and having been united, though by proxy and at a distance,\r\nto a prince whom she had never seen, but whom she knew to be tall, well\r\nmade, and a friend to the sciences, she revolted at the idea of giving\r\nhim up for a prince without beauty, and to such an extent without\r\neducation, that, it is said, Charles VIII., when he ascended the throne,\r\nwas unable to read.  When he was spoken of to the young princess, “I am\r\nengaged in the bonds of matrimony to Archduke Maximilian,” said Anne:\r\n“and the King of France, on his side, is affianced to the Princess\r\nMarguerite of Austria; we are not free, either of us.”  She went so far\r\nas to say that she would set out and go and join Maximilian.  Her\r\nadvisers, who had nearly all of them become advocates of the French\r\nmarriage, did their best to combat this obstinacy on the part of their\r\nprincess, and they proposed to her other marriages.  Anne answered, “I\r\nwill marry none but a king or a king’s son.”  Whilst the question was\r\nthus being disputed at the little court of Rennes, the army of Charles\r\nVIII. was pressing the city more closely every day.  Parleys took place\r\nbetween the leaders of the two hosts; and the Duke of Orleans made his\r\nway into Rennes, had an interview with the Duchess Anne, and succeeded in\r\nshaking her in her refusal of any French marriage.  “Many maintain,” says\r\nCount Philip de Segur [_Histoire de Charles VIII,_ t. i. p. 217], “that\r\nCharles VIII. himself entered alone and without escort into the town he\r\nwas besieging, had a conversation with the young duchess, and left to her\r\nthe decision of their common fate, declaring to her that she was free and\r\nhe her captive; that all roads would be open to her to go to England or\r\nto Germany; and that, for himself, he would go to Touraine to await the\r\ndecision whereon depended, together with the happiness of his own future,\r\nthat of all the kingdom.”  Whatever may be the truth about these\r\nchivalrous traditions, there was concluded on the 15th of September,\r\n1491, a treaty whereby the two parties submitted themselves for an\r\nexamination of all questions that concerned them to twenty-four\r\ncommissioners, taken half and half from the two hosts; and, in order to\r\ngive the preconcerted resolution an appearance of mutual liberty,\r\nauthority was given to the young Duchess Anne to go, if she pleased,\r\nand join Maximilian in Germany.  Charles VIII., accompanied by a hundred\r\nmen-at-arms and fifty archers of his guard, again entered Rennes; and\r\nthree days afterwards the King of France and the Duchess of Brittany were\r\nsecretly affianced in the chapel of Notre-Dame.  The Duke of Orleans, the\r\nDuchess of Bourbon, the Prince of Orange, Count Dunois, and some Breton\r\nlords, were the sole witnesses of the ceremony.  Next day Charles VIII.\r\nleft Rennes and repaired to the castle of Langeais in Touraine.  There\r\nthe Duchess Anne joined him a fortnight afterwards.  The young Princess\r\nMarguerite of Austria, who had for eight years been under guardianship\r\nand education at Amboise as the future wife of the King of France, was\r\nremoved from France and taken back into Flanders to her father, Archduke\r\nMaximilian, with all the external honors that could alleviate such an\r\ninsult.  On the 13th of December, 1491, the contract of marriage between\r\nCharles VIII. and Anne of Brittany was drawn up in the great hall of the\r\ncastle of Langeais, in two drafts, one in French and the other in Breton.\r\nThe Bishop of Alby celebrated the nuptial ceremony.  By that deed, “if my\r\nLady Anne were to die before King Charles, and his children, issue of\r\ntheir marriage, she ceded and transferred irrevocably to him and his\r\nsuccessors, kings of France, all her rights to the duchy of Brittany.\r\nKing Charles ceded in like manner to my Lady Anne his rights to the\r\npossession of the said duchy, if he were to die before her with-out\r\nchildren born of their marriage.  My Lady Anne could not, in case of\r\nwidowhood, contract a second marriage save with the future king, if it\r\nwere his pleasure and were possible, or with other near and presumptive\r\nfuture successor to the throne, who should be bound to make to the king\r\nregnant, on account of the said duchy, the same acknowledgments that the\r\npredecessors of the said Lady Anne had made.”  On the 7th of February,\r\n1492, Anne was crowned at St. Denis; and next day, the 8th of February,\r\nshe made her entry in state into Paris, amidst the joyful and earnest\r\nacclamations of the public.  A sensible and a legitimate joy: for the\r\nreunion of Brittany to France was the consolidation of the peace which,\r\nin this same century, on the 17th of September, 1453, had put an end to\r\nthe Hundred Years’ War between France and England, and was the greatest\r\nact that remained to be accomplished to insure the definitive victory and\r\nthe territorial constitution of French nationality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meeting between Charles VIII, and Anne of Brittany----282]\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. was pleased with and proud of himself.  He had achieved a\r\nbrilliant and a difficult marriage.  In Europe, and within his own\r\nhousehold, he had made a display of power and independence.  In order to\r\nespouse Anne of Brittany, he had sent back Marguerite of Austria to her\r\nfather.  He had gone in person and withdrawn from prison his cousin Louis\r\nof Orleans, whom his sister, Anne de Beaujeu, had put there; and so far\r\nfrom having got embroiled with her, he saw all the royal family\r\nreconciled around him.  This was no little success for a young prince of\r\ntwenty-one.  He thereupon devoted himself with ardor and confidence to\r\nhis desire of winning back the kingdom of Naples, which Alphonso I.,\r\nKing of Arragon, had wrested from the house of France, and of thereby\r\nre-opening for himself in the East, and against Islamry, that career of\r\nChristian glory which had made a saint of his ancestor, Louis IX.\r\nMediocre men are not safe from the great dreams which have more than once\r\nseduced and ruined the greatest men.  The very mediocre son of Louis XI.,\r\non renouncing his father’s prudent and by no means chivalrous policy, had\r\nno chance of becoming a great warrior and a saint; but not the less did\r\nhe take the initiative as to those wars in Italy which were to be so\r\ncostly to his successors and to France.  By two treaties concluded in\r\n1493 [one at Barcelona on the 19th of January and the other at Senlis on\r\nthe 23d of May], he gave up Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, King of Arragon, and Franche-Comte, Artois, and Charolais to\r\nthe house of Austria, and, after having at such a lamentable price\r\npurchased freedom of movement, he went and took up his quarters at Lyons\r\nto prepare for his Neapolitan venture.\r\n\r\nIn his council he found loyal and able opponents.  “On the undertaking of\r\nthis trip,” says Philip de Commynes, one of those present, “there was\r\nmany a discussion, for it seemed to all folks of wisdom and experience\r\nvery dangerous .  .  .  all things necessary for so great a purpose were\r\nwanting; the king was very young, a poor creature, wilful and with but a\r\nsmall attendance of wise folk and good leaders; no ready money; neither\r\ntents, nor pavilions for wintering in Lombardy.  One thing good they had:\r\na lusty company full of young men of family, but little under control.”\r\n The chiefest warrior of France at this time, Philip de Crevecoeur,\r\nMarshal d’Esquerdes, threw into the opposition the weight of his age and\r\nof his recognized ability.  “The greatness and tranquillity of the\r\nrealm,” said he, “depend on possession of the Low Countries; that is the\r\ndirection in which we must use all our exertions rather than against a\r\nstate, the possession of which, so far from being advantageous to us,\r\ncould not but weaken us.”  “Unhappily,” says the latest, learned\r\nhistorian of Charles VIII.  [_Histoire de Charles VIII._, by the late M.\r\nde Cherrier, t. i. p. 393], “the veteran marshal died on the 22d of\r\nApril, 1494, in a small town some few leagues from Lyons, and thenceforth\r\nall hope of checking the current became visionary.  .  .  .  On the 8th\r\nof September, 1494, Charles VIII. started from Grenoble, crossed Mount\r\nGenevre, and went and slept at Oulx, which was territory of Piedmont.  In\r\nthe evening a peasant who was accused of being a master of Vaudery\r\n[i.e. one of the Vaudois, a small population of reformers in the Alps,\r\nbetween Piedmont and Dauphiny] was brought before him; the king gave him\r\naudience, and then handed him over to the provost, who had him hanged on\r\na tree.”  By such an act of severity, perpetrated in a foreign country\r\nand on the person of one who was not his own subject, did Charles VIII.\r\ndistinguish his first entry into Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles VIII. crossing the Alps----285]\r\n\r\nIt were out of place to follow out here in all its details a war which\r\nbelongs to the history of Italy far more than to that of France; it will\r\nsuffice to point out with precision the positions of the principal\r\nItalian states at this period, and the different shares of influence they\r\nexercised on the fate of the French expedition.\r\n\r\nSix principal states, Piedmont, the kingdom of the Dukes of Savoy; the\r\nduchy of Milan; the republic of Venice; the republic of Florence; Rome\r\nand the pope; and the kingdom of Naples, co-existed in Italy at the end\r\nof the fifteenth century.  In August, 1494, when Charles VIII. started\r\nfrom Lyons on his Italian expedition, Piedmout was governed by Blanche of\r\nMontferrat, widow of Charles the ‘Warrior,’ Duke of Savoy, in the name of\r\nher son Charles John Amadeo, a child only six years old.  In the duchy of\r\nMilan the power was in the hands of Ludovic Sforza, called the Moor, who,\r\nbeing ambitious, faithless, lawless, unscrupulous, employed it in\r\nbanishing to Pavia the lawful duke, his own nephew, John Galeas Mario\r\nSforza, of whom the Florentine ambassador said to Ludovic himself, “This\r\nyoung man seems to me a good young man and animated by good sentiments,\r\nbut very deficient in wits.”  He was destined to die ere long, probably\r\nby poison.  The republic of Venice had at this period for its doge\r\nAugustin Barbarigo; and it was to the council of Ten that in respect of\r\nforeign affairs as well as of the home department the power really\r\nbelonged.  Peter de’ Medici, son of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the father of the\r\nMuses, was feebly and stupidly, though with all the airs and pretensions\r\nof a despot, governing the republic of Florence.\r\n\r\nRome had for pope Alexander VI.  (Poderigo Borgia), a prince who was\r\ncovetous, licentious, and brazen-facedly fickle and disloyal in his\r\npolicy, and who would be regarded as one of the most utterly demoralized\r\nmen of the fifteenth century, only that he had for son a Caesar Borgia.\r\nFinally, at Naples, in 1494, three months before the day on which Charles\r\nVIII, entered Italy, King Alphonso II. ascended the throne.  “No man,”\r\n says Commynes, “was ever more cruel than he, or more wicked, or more\r\nvicious and tainted, or more gluttonous; less dangerous, however, than\r\nhis father, King Ferdinand, the which did take in and betray folks whilst\r\ngiving them good cheer (kindly welcome), as hath been told to me by his\r\nrelatives and friends, and who did never have any pity or compassion for\r\nhis poor people.”  Such, in Italy, whether in her kingdoms or her\r\nrepublics, were the Heads with whom Charles VIII. had to deal when he\r\nwent, in the name of a disputed right, three hundred leagues away from\r\nhis own kingdom in quest of a bootless and ephemeral conquest.\r\n\r\nThe reception he met with at the outset of his enterprise could not but\r\nconfirm him in his illusory hopes.  Whilst he was at Lyons, engaged in\r\npreparations for his departure, Duke Charles of Savoy, whose territories\r\nwere the first he would have to cross, came to see him on a personal\r\nmatter.  “Cousin, my good friend,” said the king to him, “I am delighted\r\nto see you at Lyons, for, if you had delayed your coming, I had intended\r\nto go myself to see you, with a very numerous company, in your own\r\ndominions, where it is likely such a visit could not but have caused you\r\nloss.”  “My lord,” answered the duke, “my only regret at your arrival in\r\nmy dominions would be, that I should be unable to give you such welcome\r\nthere as is due to so great a prince.  .  .  .  However, whether here or\r\nelsewhere, I shall be always ready to beg that you will dispose of me and\r\nall that pertains to me just as of all that might belong to your own\r\nsubjects.”  Duke Charles of Savoy had scarcely exaggerated; he was no\r\nlonger living in September, 1494, when Charles VIII, demanded of his\r\nwidow Blanche, regent in the name of her infant son, a free passage for\r\nthe French army over her territory, and she not only granted his request,\r\nbut, when he entered Turin, she had him received exactly as he might have\r\nbeen in the greatest cities of France.  He admired the magnificent jewels\r\nshe wore; and she offered to lend them to him.  He accepted them, and\r\nsoon afterwards borrowed on the strength of them twelve thousand golden\r\nducats; so ill provided was he with money.  The fair regent, besides,\r\nmade him a present of a fine black horse, which Commynes calls the best\r\nin the world, and which, ten months later, Charles rode at the battle of\r\nFornovo, the only victory he was to gain on retiring from this sorry\r\ncampaign.  On entering the country of the Milanese he did not experience\r\nthe same feeling of confidence that Piedmont had inspired him with.  Not\r\nthat Ludovic the Moor hesitated to lavish upon him assurances of\r\ndevotion.  “Sir,” said he, “have no fear for this enterprise; there are\r\nin Italy three powers which we consider great, and of which you have one,\r\nwhich is Milan; another, which is the Venetians, does not stir; so you\r\nhave to do only with that of Naples, and many of your predecessors have\r\nbeaten us when we were all united.  If you will trust me, I will help to\r\nmake you greater than ever was Charlemagne; and when you have in your\r\nhands this kingdom of Naples, we shall easily drive yon Turk out of that\r\nempire of Constantinople.”  These words pleased Charles VIII. mightily,\r\nand he would have readily pinned his faith to them; but he had at his\r\nside some persons more clear-sighted, and Ludovic had enemies who did not\r\ndeny themselves the pleasure of enlightening the king concerning him.  He\r\ninvited Charles to visit Milan; he desired to parade before the eyes of\r\nthe people his alliance and intimate friendship with the powerful King of\r\nFrance; but Charles, who had at first treated him as a friend, all at\r\nonce changed his demeanor, and refused to go to Milan, “so as not to lose\r\ntime.”  Ludovic was too good a judge to make any mistake in the matter;\r\nbut he did not press the point.  Charles resumed his road to Piacenza,\r\nwhere his army awaited him.  At Pavia, vows, harangues, felicitations,\r\nprotestations of devotion, were lavished upon him without restoring his\r\nconfidence; quarters had been assigned to him within the city; he\r\ndetermined to occupy the castle, which was in a state of defence; his own\r\nguard took possession of the guard-posts; and the watch was doubled\r\nduring the night.  Ludovic appeared to take no notice, and continued to\r\naccompany the king as far as Piacenza, the last town in the state of\r\nMilan.  Into it Charles entered with seventy-eight hundred horse, many\r\nSwiss foot, and many artillerymen and bombardiers.  The Italian\r\npopulation regarded this army with an admiration tinged with timidity and\r\nanxiety.  News was heard there to the effect that young John Galeas,\r\nnephew of Ludovic the Moor and lawful Duke of Milan, was dead.  He left a\r\nson, five years old, for whom he had at Pavia implored the king’s\r\nprotection; and “I will look upon him as my own,” King Charles had\r\nanswered as he fondled the child.  Ludovic set out in haste for Milan;\r\nand it was not long before it was known that he had been proclaimed duke\r\nand put in possession of the duchy.  Distrust became general throughout\r\nthe army.  “Those who ought to have known best told me,” says Commynes,\r\n“that several, who had at first commended the trip, now found fault with\r\nit, and that there was a great inclination to turn back.”  However, the\r\nmarch was continued forward; and on the 29th of October, 1494, the French\r\narmy encamped before Sarzana, a Florentine town.  Ludovic the Moor\r\nsuddenly arrived in the camp with new proposals of alliance, on new\r\nconditions: Charles accepted some of them, and rejected the principal\r\nones.  Ludovic went away again on the 3d of November, never to return.\r\n\r\nFrom this day the King of France might reckon him amongst his enemies.\r\nWith the republic of Florence was henceforth to be Charles’s business.\r\nIts head, Peter de’ Medici, went to the camp at Sarzana, and Philip de\r\nCommynes started on an embassy to go and negotiate with the doge and\r\nsenate of Venice, which was the chiefest of the Italian powers and the\r\nterritory of which lay far out of the line of march of the King of France\r\nand his army.  In the presence of the King of France and in the midst of\r\nhis troops Peter de’ Medici grew embarrassed and confused.  He had gone\r\nto meet the king without the knowledge of the Florentines and was already\r\nalarmed at the gravity of his situation; and he offered more concession\r\nand submission than was demanded of him.  “Those who treated with him,”\r\n says Commynes, “told me, turning him to scorn and ridicule, that they\r\nwere dumbfounded at his so readily granting so great a matter and what\r\nthey were not prepared for.”  Feelings were raised to the highest pitch\r\nat Florence when his weaknesses were known.  There was a numerous and\r\npowerful party, consisting of the republicans and the envious, hostile to\r\nthe Medicis; and they eagerly seized the opportunity of attacking them.\r\nA deputation, comprising the most considerable men of the city, was sent,\r\non the 5th of November, to the King of France with a commission to obtain\r\nfrom him more favorable conditions.  The Dominican, Jerome Savonarola, at\r\nthat time the popular oracle of Florence, was one of them.  With a pious\r\nhauteur that was natural and habitual to him, he adopted the same tone\r\ntowards Charles as towards the people of Florence.  “Hearken thou to my\r\nwords,” said he, “and grave them upon thy heart.  I warn thee, in God’s\r\nname, that thou must show thyself merciful and forbearing to the people\r\nof Florence, if thou wouldest that He should aid thee in thy enterprise.”\r\n Charles, who scarcely knew Savonarola by name, answered simply that he\r\ndid not wish to do the Florentines any harm, but that he demanded a free\r\npassage, and all that had been promised him: “I wish to be received at\r\nFlorence,” he added, “to sign there a definitive treaty which shall\r\nsettle everything.”  At these cold expressions the ambassadors withdrew\r\nin some disquietude.  Peter de’ Medici, who was lightly confident,\r\nreturned to Florence on the 8th of November, and attempted again to seize\r\nthe supreme power.  A violent outbreak took place; Peter was as weak\r\nbefore the Florentine populace as he had been before the King of France;\r\nand, having been harried in his very palace, which was given up to\r\npillage, it was only in the disguise of a monk that he was able, on the\r\n9th of November, to get out of the city in company with his two brothers,\r\nJulian and Cardinal John de’ Medici, of whom the latter was to be, ten\r\nyears later, Pope Leo X.  Peter and his brothers having been driven out,\r\nthe Florentines were anxious to be reconciled with Charles VIII.  Both by\r\npolitical tradition and popular bias the Florentine republic was\r\nfavorable to France.  Charles, annoyed at what had just taken place,\r\nshowed but slight inclination to enter into negotiation with them; but\r\nhis wisest advisers represented to him that, in order to accomplish his\r\nenterprise and march securely on Naples, he needed the good will of\r\nFlorence; and the new Florentine authorities promised him the best of\r\nreceptions in their city.  Into it Charles entered on the 17th of\r\nNovember, 1494, at the head of all his army.  His reception on the part\r\nof officials and populace was really magnificent.  Negotiation was\r\nresumed.  Charles was at first very exacting; the Florentine negotiators\r\nprotested; one of them, Peter Capponi, “a man of great wits and great\r\ncourage,” says Guiceiardini, “highly esteemed for those qualities in\r\nFlorence, and issue of a family which had been very powerful in the\r\nrepublic,” when he heard read the exorbitant conditions proposed to them\r\non the king’s behalf, started up suddenly, took the paper from the\r\nsecretary’s hands, and tore it up before the king’s eyes, saying, “Since\r\nyou impose upon us things so dishonorable, have your trumpets sounded,\r\nand we will have our bells rung;” and he went forth from the chamber\r\ntogether with his comrades.  Charles and his advisers thought better of\r\nit; mutual concessions were made; a treaty, concluded on the 25th of\r\nNovember, secured to the King of France a free passage through the whole\r\nextent of the republic, and a sum of one hundred and twenty thousand\r\ngolden florins “to help towards the success of the expedition against\r\nNaples;” the commune of Florence engaged to revoke the order putting a\r\nprice upon the head of Peter de’ Medici as well as confiscating his\r\ngoods, and not to enforce against him any penalty beyond proscription\r\nfrom the territory; and, the honor as well as the security of both the\r\ncontracting parties having thus been provided for, Charles VIII. left\r\nFlorence, and took, with his army, the road towards the Roman States.\r\n\r\nHaving on the 7th of December, 1494, entered Acquapendente, and, on the\r\n10th, Viterbo, he there received, on the following day, a message from\r\nPope Alexander VI., who in his own name and that of Alphonso II., King of\r\nNaples, made him an offer of a million ducats to defray the expenses of\r\nthe war, and a hundred thousand livres annually, on condition that he\r\nwould abandon his enterprise against the kingdom of Naples.  “I have no\r\nmind to make terms with the Arragonese usurper,” answered Charles: “I\r\nwill treat directly with the pope when I am in Rome, which I reckon upon\r\nentering about Christmas.  I have already made known to him my\r\nintentions; I will forthwith send him ambassadors commissioned to repeat\r\nthem to him.”  And he did send to him the most valiant of his warriors,\r\nLouis de la Tremoille, “the which was there,” says the contemporary\r\nchronicler, John Bouchet, “with certain speakers, who, after having\r\npompously reminded the pope of the whole history of the French kingship\r\nin its relations with the papacy, ended up in the following strain:\r\n‘prayeth you, then, our sovereign lord the king not to give him occasion\r\nto be, to his great sorrow, the first of his lineage who ever had war and\r\ndiscord with the Roman Church, whereof he and the Christian Kings of\r\nFrance, his predecessors, have been protectors and augmenters.’  More\r\nbriefly and with an affectation of sorrowful graciousness, the pope made\r\nanswer to the ambassador: ‘If it please King Charles, my eldest spiritual\r\nson, to enter into my city without arms in all humility, he will be most\r\nwelcome; but much would it annoy me if the army of thy king should enter,\r\nbecause that, under shadow of it, which is said to be great and riotous,\r\nthe factions and bands of Rome might rise up and cause uproar and\r\nscandal, wherefrom great discomforts might happen to the citizens.’”\r\n For three weeks the king and the pope offered the spectacle, only too\r\ncommon in history, of the hypocrisy of might pitted against the hypocrisy\r\nof religion.  At last the pope saw the necessity of yielding; he sent for\r\nPrince Ferdinand, son of the King of Naples, and told him that he must no\r\nlonger remain at Rome with the Neapolitan troops, for that the King of\r\nFrance was absolute about entering; and he at the same time handed him a\r\nsafe-conduct under Charles’s own hand.  Ferdinand refused the\r\nsafe-conduct, and threw himself upon his knees before the pope, asking\r\nhim for his blessing: “Rise, my dear son,” said the pope; “go, and have\r\ngood hope; God will come to our aid.”  The Neapolitans departed, and on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1495, Charles VIII. entered Rome with his army,\r\n“saying gentlewise,” according to Brantome, “that a while agone he had\r\nmade a vow to my lord St. Peter of Rome, and that of necessity he must\r\naccomplish it at the peril of his life.  Behold him, then, entered into\r\nRome,” continues Brantome, “in bravery and triumph, himself armed at all\r\npoints, with lance on thigh, as if he would fain pick forward to the\r\ncharge.  Marching in this fine and furious order of battle, with trumpets\r\na-sounding and drums a-beating, he enters in and takes his lodging, by\r\nthe means of his harbingers, wheresoever it seems to him good, has his\r\nbodies of guards set, posts his sentinels about the places and districts\r\nof the noble city, with no end of rounds and patrols, has his tribunals\r\nand his gallows planted in five or six different spots, his edicts and\r\nordinances being published and proclaimed by sound of trumpet, as if he\r\nhad been in Paris.  Go find me ever a King of France who did such things,\r\nsave Charlemagne; yet trow I he did not bear himself with authority so\r\nsuperb and imperious.  What remained, then, more for this great king, if\r\nnot to make himself full master of this glorious city which had subdued\r\nall the world in days of yore, as it was in his power to do, and as he,\r\nperchance, would fain have done, in accordance with his ambition and with\r\nsome of his council, who urged him mightily thereto, if it were only for\r\nto keep himself secure.  But far from this: violation of holy religion\r\ngave him pause, and the reproach that might have been brought against him\r\nof having done offence to his Holiness, though reason enough had been\r\ngiven him: on the contrary, he rendered him all honor and obedience, even\r\nto kissing in all humility his slipper!” [_Oeuvres de Brantome_ (Paris,\r\n1822), t. ii. p. 3.]  No excuse is required for quoting this fragment of\r\nBrantome; for it gives the truest and most striking picture of the\r\nconditions of facts and sentiments during this transitory encounter\r\nbetween a madly adventurous king and a brazen-facedly dishonest pope.\r\nThus they passed four weeks at Rome, the pope having retired at first to\r\nthe Vatican and afterwards to the castle of St. Angelo, and Charles\r\nremaining master of the city, which, in a fit of mutual ill-humor and\r\nmistrust, was for one day given over to pillage and the violence of the\r\nsoldiery.  At last, on the 15th of January, a treaty was concluded which\r\nregulated pacific relations between the two sovereigns, and secured to\r\nthe French army a free passage through the States of the Church, both\r\ngoing to Naples and also returning, and provisional possession of the\r\ntown of Civita Vecchia, on condition that it should be restored to the\r\npope when the king returned to France.  On the 16th and 19th of January\r\nthe pope and the king had two interviews, one private and the other\r\npublic, at which they renewed their engagements, and paid one another the\r\nstipulated honors.  It was announced that, on the 23d of January, the\r\nArragonese King of Naples, Alphonso II., had abdicated in favor of his\r\nson, Ferdinand II.; and, on the 28th of January, Charles VIII. took\r\nsolemn leave of the pope, received his blessing, and left Rome, as he had\r\nentered it, at the head of his army, and more confident than ever in the\r\nsuccess of the expedition he was going to carry out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles VIII----293]\r\n\r\nFerdinand II., the new King of Naples, who had no lack of energy or\r\ncourage, was looking everywhere, at home and abroad, for forces and\r\nallies to oppose the imminent invasion.  To the Duke of Milan he wrote,\r\n“Remember that we two are of the same blood.  It is much to be desired\r\nthat a league should at once be formed between the pope, the kings of the\r\nRomans and Spain, you, and Venice.  If these powers are united, Italy\r\nwould have nought to fear from any.  Give me your support; I have the\r\ngreatest need of it.  If you back me, I shall owe to you the preservation\r\nof my throne, and I will honor you as my father.”  He ordered the\r\nNeapolitan envoy at Constantinople to remind Sultan Bajazet of the\r\nre-enforcements he had promised his father, King Alphonso: “Time presses;\r\nthe King of France is advancing in person on Naples; be instant in\r\nsolicitation; be importunate if necessary, so that the Turkish army cross\r\nthe sea without delay.  Be present yourself at the embarkation of the\r\ntroops.  Be active; run; fly.”  He himself ran through all his kingdom,\r\nstriving to resuscitate some little spark of affection and hope.  He had\r\nno success anywhere; the memory of the king his father was hateful; he\r\nwas himself young and without influence; his ardor caused fear instead of\r\nsympathy.  Charles kept advancing along the kingdom through the midst of\r\npeople that remained impassive when they did not give him a warm\r\nreception.  The garrison of Monte San Giovanni, the strongest place on\r\nthe frontier, determined to resist.  The place was carried by assault in\r\na few hours, and “the assailants,” says a French chronicler, “without\r\npity or compassion, made short work of all those plunderers and\r\nmalefactors, whose bodies they hurled down from the walls.  The carnage\r\nlasted eight whole hours.”  A few days afterwards Charles with his guard\r\narrived in front of San Germano: “The clergy awaited him at the gate with\r\ncross and banner; men of note carried a dais under the which he took his\r\nplace; behind him followed men, women, and children, chanting this\r\nversicle from the Psalms: ‘Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini!\r\nBlessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord!’”  The town of Capua\r\nwas supposed to be very much attached to the house of Arragon; John James\r\nTrivulzio, a valiant Milanese captain, who had found asylum and fortune\r\nin Naples, had the command there; and thither King Ferdinand hurried.\r\n“I am going to Naples for troops,” said he to the inhabitants; “wait for\r\nme confidently; and if by to-morrow evening you do not see me return,\r\nmake your own terms with King Charles; you have my full authority.”\r\n On arriving at Naples, he said to the Neapolitans, “Hold out for a\r\nfortnight; I will not expose the capital of my kingdom to be stormed by\r\nbarbarians; if, within a fort-night hence, I have not prevented the enemy\r\nfrom crossing the Volturno, you may ask him for terms of capitulation;”\r\n and back he went to Capua.  When he was within sight of the ramparts he\r\nheard that on the previous evening, before it was night, the French had\r\nbeen admitted into the town.  Trivulzio had been to visit King Charles at\r\nTeano, and had offered, in the name of his troops and of the Capuans, to\r\nsurrender Capua; he had even added, says Guicciardini, that he did not\r\ndespair of bringing King Ferdinand himself to an arrangement, if a\r\nsuitable provision were guaranteed to him.  “I willingly accept the offer\r\nyou make me in the name of your troops and of the Capuans,” answered\r\nCharles: “as for the Arragonese prince, he shall be well received if he\r\ncome to me; but let him understand that not an inch of ground shall be\r\nleft to him in this kingdom; in France he shall have honors and beautiful\r\ndomains.”  On the 18th of February Charles entered Capua amidst the\r\ncheers of the people; and on the same day Trivulzio went over to his\r\nservice with a hundred lances.  On returning to Naples, Ferdinand found\r\nthe gates closed, and could not get into Castel Nuovo save by a postern.\r\nAt that very moment the mob was pillaging his stables; he went down from\r\nthe fortress, addressed the crowd collected beneath the ramparts in a few\r\nsad and bitter words, into which he tried to infuse some leaven of hope,\r\ntook certain measures to enable the two forts of Naples, Castel Nuovo and\r\nCastel dell Uovo, to defend themselves for a few days longer, and, on the\r\n23d of February, went for refuge to the island of Ischia, repeating out\r\nloud, as long as he had Naples in sight, this versicle from the Psalms:\r\n“Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain!”  At\r\nIschia itself “he had a fresh trial to make,” says Guicciardini, “of his\r\ncourage and of the ungrateful faithlessness displayed towards those whom\r\nFortune deserts.”  The governor of the island refused to admit him\r\naccompanied by more than one man.  The prince, so soon as he got in,\r\nflung himself upon him, poniard in hand, with such fury and such an\r\noutburst of kingly authority, that all the garrison, astounded, submitted\r\nto him and gave up to him the fort and its rock.  On the very eve of the\r\nday on which King Ferdinand II. was thus seeking his last refuge in the\r\nisland of Ischia, Charles VIII. was entering Naples in triumph at the\r\nhead of his troops, on horseback, beneath a pall of cloth of gold borne\r\nby four great Neapolitan lords, and “received,” says Guicciardini, “with\r\ncheers and a joy of which it would be vain to attempt a description; the\r\nincredible exultation of a crowd of both sexes, of every age, of every\r\ncondition, of every quality, of every party, as if he had been the father\r\nand first founder of the city.”  And the great French historian bears\r\nsimilar witness to that of the great Italian historian: “Never,” says\r\nCommynes, “did people show so much affection to king or nation as they\r\nshowed to the king, and thought all of them to be free of tyranny.”\r\n\r\nAt the news hereof the disquietude and vexation of the principal Italian\r\npowers were displayed at Venice as well as at Milan and at Rome.  The\r\nVenetian senate, as prudent as it was vigilant, had hitherto maintained a\r\ndemeanor of expectancy and almost of good will towards France; they hoped\r\nthat Charles VIII. would be stopped or would stop of himself in his mad\r\nenterprise, without their being obliged to interfere.  The doge, Augustin\r\nBarbarigo, lived on very good terms with Commynes, who was as desirous as\r\nhe was that the king should recover his senses.  Commynes was destined to\r\nlearn how difficult and sorry a thing it is to have to promote a policy\r\nof which you disapprove.  When he perceived that a league was near to\r\nbeing formed in Italy against the King of France, he at once informed his\r\nmaster of it, and attempted to dissuade the Venetians from it.  They\r\ndenied that they had any such design, and showed a disposition to form,\r\nin concert with the Kings of France, Spain, and the Romans, and with the\r\nwhole of Italy, a league against the Turks, provided that Charles VIII.\r\nwould consent to leave the King of Naples in possession of his kingdom,\r\nat the same time keeping for himself three places therein, and accepting\r\na sum in ready money which Venice would advance.  “Would to God,” says\r\nCommynes, “that the king had been pleased to listen then!  Of all did I\r\ngive him notice, and I got bare answer.  .  .  .  When the Venetians\r\nheard that the king was in Naples, and that the strong fort, which they\r\nhad great hopes would hold out, was surrendered, they sent for me one\r\nmorning, and I found them in great number, about fifty or sixty, in the\r\napartment of the prince (the doge) who was ill.  Some were sitting upon a\r\nstaircase leading to the benches, and had their heads resting upon their\r\nhands, others otherwise, all showing that they had great sadness at\r\nheart.  And I trow that, when news came to Rome of the battle lost at\r\nCannae against Hannibal, the senators who had remained there were not\r\nmore dumbfounded and dismayed than these were; for not a single one made\r\nsign of seeing me, or spoke to me one word, save the duke (the doge), who\r\nasked me if the king would keep to that of which he had constantly sent\r\nthem word, and which I had said to them.  I assured them stoutly that he\r\nwould, and I opened up ways for to remain at sound peace, hoping to\r\nremove their suspicions, and then I did get me gone.”\r\n\r\nThe league was concluded on the 31st of March, 1495, between Pope\r\nAlexander VI., Emperor Maximilian I., as King of the Romans, the King of\r\nSpain, the Venetians, and the Duke of Milan: “To three ends,” says\r\nCommynes, “for to defend Christendom against the Turks, for the defence\r\nof Italy, and for the preservation of their Estates.  There was nothing\r\nin it against the king, they told me, but it was to secure themselves\r\nfrom him; they did not like his so deluding the world with words by\r\nsaying that all he wanted was the kingdom, and then to march against the\r\nTurk, and all the while he was showing quite the contrary.  .  .  .  I\r\nremained in the city about a month after that, being as well treated as\r\nbefore; and then I went my way, having been summoned by the king, and\r\nbeing conducted in perfect security, at their expense, to Ferrara, whence\r\nI went to Florence for to await the king.”\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand II. took refuge in the island of Ischia, and Castel Nuovo\r\nand Castel dell’ Uovo had surrendered at Naples, Charles VIII.,\r\nconsidering himself in possession of the kingdom, announced his\r\nintention, and, there is reason to believe, actually harbored the design,\r\nof returning to France, without asserting any further his pretensions as\r\na conqueror.  On the 20th of March, before the Italian league had been\r\ndefinitively concluded, Briconnet, Cardinal of St. Malo, who had attended\r\nthe king throughout his expedition, wrote to the queen, Anne of Brittany,\r\n“His Majesty is using diligence as best he can to return over yonder, and\r\nhas expressly charged me, for my part, to hasten his affairs.  I hope he\r\nwill be able to start hence about the 8th of April.  He will leave over\r\nhere, as lieutenant, my lord de Montpensier, with a thousand or twelve\r\nhundred lances, partly French and partly of this country, fifteen hundred\r\nSwiss, and a thousand French crossbow-men.”  Charles himself wrote, on\r\nthe 28th of March, to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Bourbon, that he\r\nwould mount his horse immediately after Quasimodo [the first Sunday after\r\nEaster], to return to France without halting, or staying in any place.\r\nBut Charles, whilst so speaking and projecting, was forgetful of his\r\ngiddy indolence, his frivolous tastes, and his passion for theatrical\r\ndisplay and licentious pleasure.  The climate, the country, the customs\r\nof Naples charmed him.  “You would never believe,” he wrote to the Duke\r\nof Bourbon, “what beautiful gardens I have in this city; on my faith,\r\nthey seem to me to lack only Adam and Eve to make of them an earthly\r\nparadise, so beautiful are they, and full of nice and curious things, as\r\nI hope to tell you soon.  To add to that, I have found in this country\r\nthe best of painters; and I will send you some of them to make the most\r\nbeautiful ceilings possible.  The ceilings at Beauce, Lyons, and other\r\nplaces in France do not approach those of this place in beauty and\r\nrichness.  .  .  .  Wherefore I shall provide myself with them, and bring\r\nthem with me for to have some done at Arnboise.”  Politics were forgotten\r\nin the presence of these royal fancies.  Charles VIII. remained nearly\r\ntwo months at Naples after the Italian league had been concluded, and\r\nwhilst it was making its preparations against him was solely concerned\r\nabout enjoying, in his beautiful but precarious kingdom, “all sorts of\r\nmundane pleasaunces,” as his councillor, the Cardinal of St. Malo, says,\r\nand giving entertainments to his new subjects, as much disposed as\r\nhimself to forget everything in amusement.  On the 12th of May, 1495, all\r\nthe population of Naples and of the neighboring country was afoot early\r\nto see their new king make his entry in state as King of Naples, Sicily,\r\nand Jerusalem, with his Neapolitan court and his French army.  Charles\r\nwas on horseback beneath a rich dais borne by great Neapolitan lords; he\r\nhad a close crown on his head, the sceptre in his right hand, and a\r\ngolden globe in his left; in front of this brilliant train he took his\r\nway through the principal streets of the city, halting at the five knots\r\nof the noblesse, where the gentlemen and their wives who had assembled\r\nthere detained him a long while, requesting him to be pleased to confer\r\nwith his own hand the order of knighthood on their sons, which he\r\nwillingly did.  At last he reached the cathedral church of St.\r\nJanuarius, which had recently been rebuilt by Alphonso I. of Arragon,\r\nafter the earth-quake of 1456.  The archbishop, at the head of his\r\nclergy, came out to meet him, and conducted him to the front of the high\r\naltar, where the head of St. Januarius was exhibited.\r\n\r\nWhen all these solemnities had been accomplished to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the populace, bonfires were lighted up for three days;\r\nthe city was illuminated; and only a week afterwards, on the 20th of May,\r\n1495, Charles VIII. started from Naples to return to France, with an\r\narmy, at the most, from twelve to fifteen thousand strong, leaving for\r\nguardian of his new kingdom his cousin, Gilbert of Bourbon, Count de\r\nMontpensier, a brave but indolent knight (who never rose, it was said,\r\nuntil noon), with eight or ten thousand men, scattered for the most part\r\nthroughout the provinces.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of April and May, thus wasted by Charles VIII., the\r\nItalian league, and especially the Venetians and the Duke of Milan,\r\nLudovic the Moor, had vigorously pushed forward their preparations for\r\nwar, and had already collected an army more numerous than that with which\r\nthe King of France, in order to return home, would have to traverse the\r\nwhole of Italy.  He took more than six weeks to traverse it, passing\r\nthree days at Rome, four at Siena, the same number at Pisa, and three at\r\nLucca, though he had declared that he would not halt anywhere.  He evaded\r\nentering Florence, where he had made promises which he could neither\r\nretract nor fulfil.  The Dominican Savonarola, “who had always preached\r\ngreatly in the king’s favor,” says Commynes, “and by his words had kept\r\nthe Florentines from turning against us,” came to see him on his way at\r\nPoggibonsi.  “I asked him,” said Commynes, “whether the king would be\r\nable to cross without danger to his person, seeing the great muster that\r\nwas being made by the Venetians.  He answered me that the king would have\r\ntrouble on the road, but that the honor would remain his, though he had\r\nbut a hundred men at his back; but, seeing that he had not done well for\r\nthe reformation of the Church, as he ought, and had suffered his men to\r\nplunder and rob the people, God had given sentence against him, and in\r\nshort he would have a touch of the scourge.”\r\n\r\nSeveral contemporary historians affirm that if the Italian army, formed\r\nby the Venetians and the Duke of Milan, had opposed the march of the\r\nFrench army, they might have put it in great peril; but nothing of the\r\nkind was attempted.  It was at the passage of the Appennines, so as to\r\ncross them and descend into the duchy of Parma, that Charles VIII. had\r\nfor the first time to overcome resistance, not from men, but from nature.\r\nHe had in his train a numerous and powerful artillery, from which he\r\npromised himself a great deal when the day of battle came; and he had to\r\nget it up and down by steep paths, “Here never,” says the chronicle of La\r\nTremoille, “had car or carriage gone.  .  .  .”  The king, knowing that\r\nthe lord of La Tremoille, such was his boldness and his strong will,\r\nthought nothing impossible, gave to him this duty, which he willingly\r\nundertook; and, to the end that the footmen, Swiss, German, and others,\r\nmight labor thereat without fearing the heat, he addressed them as\r\nfollows: ‘The proper nature of us Gauls is strength, boldness, and\r\nferocity.  We triumphed at our coming; better would it be for us to die,\r\nthan to lose by cowardice the delight of such praise; we are all in the\r\nflower of our age and the vigor of our years; let each lend a hand to the\r\nwork of dragging the gun-carriages and carrying the cannon-balls; ten\r\ncrowns to the first man that reaches the top of the mountain before me!’\r\nThrowing off his armor, La Tremoille, in hose and shirt, himself lent a\r\nhand to the work; by dint of pulling and pushing, the artillery was got\r\nto the brow of the mountain; it was then harder still to get it down the\r\nother side, along a very narrow and rugged incline; and five whole days\r\nwere spent on this rough work, which luckily the generals of the enemy\r\ndid not attempt to molest.  La Tremoille, “black as a Moor,” says the\r\nchronicle, “by reason of the murderous heat he had endured, made his\r\nreport to the king, who said, ‘By the light of this day, cousin, you have\r\ndone more than ever could Annibal of Carthage or Caesar have done, to the\r\nperil of your person, whereof you have not been sparing to serve me, me\r\nand mine.  I vow to God, that if I may only see you back in France, the\r\nrecompense I hope to make you shall be so great, that others shall\r\nconceive fresh desire to serve me.’”\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. was wise to treat his brave men well; for the day was at\r\nhand when he would need them and all their bravery.  It was in the duchy\r\nof Parma, near the town of Fornovo, on the right bank of the Taro, an\r\naffluent of the Po, that the French and Italian armies met, on the 5th of\r\nJuly, 1495.  The French army was nine or ten thousand strong, with five\r\nor six thousand camp followers, servants or drivers; the Italian army\r\nnumbered at least thirty thousand men, well supplied and well rested,\r\nwhereas the French were fatigued with their long march, and very badly\r\noff for supplies.  During the night between the 5th and 6th of July, a\r\nviolent storm burst over the country, “rain, lightnings, and thunder so\r\nmighty,” says Commynes, “that none could say more; seemed that heaven and\r\nearth would dissolve, or that it portended some great disaster to come.”\r\n Next day, at six in the morning, Charles VIII. heard mass, received the\r\ncommunion, mounted on horseback, and set out to join his own division.\r\n“I went to him,” says Commynes, “and found him armed at all points, and\r\nmounted upon the finest horse I had ever seen in my life, called Savoy;\r\nDuke Charles of Savoy (the Duchess of Savoy,?  v. p. 288) had given it\r\nhim; it was black, and had but one eye; it was a middle-sized horse, of\r\ngood height for him who was upon it.  Seemed that this young man was\r\nquite other than either his nature, his stature, or his complexion\r\nbespoke him, for he was very timid in speaking, and is so to this day.\r\nThat horse made him look tall; and he had a good countenance, and of good\r\ncolor, and speech bold and sensible.”  On perceiving Commynes, the king\r\nsaid to him, “Go and see if yonder folks would fain parley.”  “Sir,”\r\n answered Commynes, “I will do so willingly; but I never saw two so great\r\nhosts so near to one another, and yet go their ways without fighting.”\r\n He went, nevertheless, to the Venetian advanced posts, and his trumpeter\r\nwas admitted to the presence of the Marquis of Mantua, who commanded the\r\nItalian army; but skirmishing had already commenced in all quarters, and\r\nthe first boom of the cannon was heard just as the marquis was reading\r\nCommynes’ letter.  “It is too late to speak of peace,” said he; and the\r\ntrumpeter was sent back.  The king had joined the division which he was\r\nto lead to battle.  “Gentlemen,” said he to the men-at-arms who pressed\r\naround him, “you will live or die here with me, will you not?”  And then\r\nraising his voice that he might be heard by the troops, “They are ten\r\ntimes as many as we,” he said; “but you are ten times better than they;\r\nGod loves the French; He is with us, and will do battle for us.  As far\r\nas Naples I have had the victory over my enemies; I have brought you\r\nhither without shame or blame; with God’s help I will lead you back into\r\nFrance, to our honor and that of our kingdom.”  The men-at-arms made the\r\nsign of the cross; the foot-soldiers kissed the ground; and the king made\r\nseveral knights, according to custom, before going into action.  The\r\nMarquis of Mantua’s squadrons were approaching.  “Sir,” said the bastard\r\nof Bourbon, “there is no longer time for the amusement of making knights;\r\nthe enemy is coming on in force; go we at him.”  The king gave orders to\r\ncharge, and the battle began at all points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of Fornovo----303]\r\n\r\nIt was very hotly contested, but did not last long, with alternations of\r\nsuccess and reverse on both sides.  The two principal commanders in the\r\nking’s army, Louis de la Tremoille and John James Trivulzio, sustained\r\nwithout recoiling the shock of troops far more numerous than their own.\r\n“At the throat! at the throat!!” shouted La Tremoille, after the first\r\nonset, and his three hundred men-at-arms burst upon the enemy and broke\r\ntheir line.  In the midst of the melley, the French baggage was attacked\r\nby the Stradiots, a sort of light infantry composed of Greeks recruited\r\nand paid by the Venetians.  “Let them be,” said Trivulzio to his men;\r\n“their zeal for plunder will make them forget all, and we shall give the\r\nbetter account of them.”  At one moment, the king had advanced before the\r\nmain body of his guard, without looking to see if they were close behind\r\nhim, and was not more than a hundred paces from the Marquis of Mantua,\r\nwho, seeing him scantily attended, bore down at the head of his cavalry.\r\n“Not possible is it,” says Commynes, “to do more doughtily than was done\r\non both sides.”  The king, being very hard pressed, defended himself\r\nfiercely against those who would have taken him; the bastard Matthew of\r\nBourbon, his brother-in-arms and one of the bravest knights in the army,\r\nhad thrown himself twenty paces in front of him to cover him, and had\r\njust been taken prisoner by the Marquis of Mantua in person, when a mass\r\nof the royal troops came to their aid, and released them from all peril.\r\nHere it was that Peter du Terrail, the Chevalier de Bayard, who was\r\nbarely twenty years of age, and destined to so glorious a renown, made\r\nhis first essay in arms; he had two horses killed under him, and took a\r\nstandard, which he presented to the king, who after the battle made him a\r\npresent of five hundred crowns.\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. remained master of the battle-field.  “There were still to\r\nbe seen,” says Commynes, “outside their camp, a great number of\r\nmen-at-arms, whose lances and heads only were visible, and likewise\r\nfoot-soldiers.  The king put it to the council whether he ought to give\r\nchase to them or not; some were for marching against them; but the French\r\nwere not of this opinion; they said that enough had been done, that it\r\nwas late, and that it was time to get lodged.  Night was coming on; the\r\nhost which had been in front of us withdrew into their camp, and we went\r\nto get lodged a quarter of a league from where the battle had been.  The\r\nking put up at a poorly-built farm-house, but he found there an infinite\r\nquantity of corn in sheaves, whereby the whole army profited.  Some other\r\nbits of houses there were hard by, which did for a few; and every one\r\nlodged as he could, without making any cantonment, I know well enough\r\nthat I lay in a vineyard, at full length on the bare ground, without\r\nanything else and without cloak, for the king had borrowed mine in the\r\nmorning.  Whoever had the wherewith made a meal, but few had, save a\r\nhunch of bread from a varlet’s knapsack.  I went to see the king in his\r\nchamber, where there were some wounded whom he was having dressed; he\r\nwore a good mien, and every one kept a good face; and we were not so\r\nboastful as a little before the battle, because we saw the enemy near\r\nus.”  Six days after the battle, on the 12th of July, the king wrote to\r\nhis sister, the Duchess Anne of Bourbon, “Sister, my dear, I commend\r\nmyself to you right heartily.  I wrote to my brother how that I found in\r\nmy way a big army that Lord Ludovic, the Venetians, and their allies, had\r\ngot ready against me, thinking to keep me from passing.  Against which,\r\nwith God’s help, such resistance was made, that I am come hither without\r\nany loss.  Furthermore, I am using the greatest diligence that can be to\r\nget right away, and I hope shortly to see you, which is my desire, in\r\norder to tell you at good length all about my trip.  And so God bless\r\nyou, sister, my dear, and may He have you in His keeping!”\r\n\r\nBoth armies might and did claim the victory, for they had, each of them,\r\npartly succeeded in their design.  The Italians wished to unmistakably\r\ndrive out of Italy Charles VIII., who was withdrawing voluntarily; but to\r\nmake it an unmistakable retreat, he ought to have been defeated, his army\r\nbeaten, and himself perhaps a prisoner.  With that view they attempted to\r\nbar his passage and beat him on Italian ground: in that they failed;\r\nCharles, remaining master of the battle-field, went on his way in\r\nfreedom, and covered with glory, he and his army.  He certainly left\r\nItaly, but he left it with the feeling of superiority in arms, and with\r\nthe intention of returning thither better informed and better supplied.\r\nThe Italian allies were triumphant, but without any ground of security or\r\nany lustre; the expedition of Charles VIII. was plainly only the\r\nbeginning of the foreigner’s ambitious projects, invasions and wars\r\nagainst their own beautiful land.  The King of France and his men of war\r\nhad not succeeded in conquering it, but they had been charmed with such\r\nan abode; they had displayed in their campaign knightly qualities more\r\nbrilliant and more masterful than the studied duplicity and elegant\r\neffeminacy of the Italians of the fifteenth century, and, after the\r\nbattle of Fornovo, they returned to France justly proud and foolishly\r\nconfident, notwithstanding the incompleteness of their success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE OF AMBOISE----308]\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. reigned for nearly three years longer after his return to\r\nhis kingdom; and for the first two of them he passed his time in\r\nindolently dreaming of his plans for a fresh invasion of Italy, and in\r\nfrivolous abandonment to his pleasures and the entertainments at his\r\ncourt, which he moved about from Lyons to Moulins, to Paris, to Tours,\r\nand to Amboise.  The news which came to him from Italy was worse and\r\nworse every day.  The Count de Montpensier, whom he had left at Naples,\r\ncould not hold his own there, and died a prisoner there on the 11th of\r\nNovember, 1496, after having found himself driven from place to place by\r\nFerdinand II., who by degrees recovered possession of nearly all his\r\nkingdom, merely, himself also, to die there on the 6th of October,\r\nleaving for his uncle and successor, Frederick III., the honor of\r\nrecovering the last four places held by the French.  Charles ordered a\r\nfresh army of invasion to be formed, and the Duke of Orleans was singled\r\nout to command it; but he evaded this commission.  The young _dauphin_,\r\nCharles Orlando, three years old, had just died, “a fine child and bold\r\nof speech,” says Commynes, “and one that feared not the things that other\r\nchildren are wont to fear.”  Duke Louis of Orleans, having thus become\r\nheir to the throne, did not care to go and run risks at a distance.  He,\r\nnevertheless, declared his readiness to obey an express command from the\r\nking if the title of lieutenant-general were given him; but “I will never\r\nsend him to war on compulsion,” said Charles, and nothing more was said\r\nabout it.  Whilst still constantly talking of the war he had in view,\r\nCharles attended more often and more earnestly than he hitherto had to\r\nthe internal affairs of his kingdom.  “He had gotten it into his head,”\r\n says Commynes, “that he would fain live according to God’s commandments,\r\nand set justice and the Church in good order.  He would also revise his\r\nfinances, in such sort as to levy on the people but twelve hundred\r\nthousand francs, and that in form of talliage, besides his own property\r\non which he would live, as did the kings of old.”  His two immediate\r\npredecessors, Charles VII. and Louis IX., had decreed the collation and\r\nrevision of local customs, so often the rule of civil jurisdiction; but\r\nthe work made no progress: Charles VIII., by a decree dated March 15,\r\n1497, abridged the formalities, and urged on the execution of it, though\r\nit was not completed until the reign of Charles IX.  By another decree,\r\ndated August 2, 1497, he organized and regulated, as to its powers as\r\nwell as its composition, the king’s grand council, the supreme\r\nadministrative body, which was a fixture at Paris.  He began even to\r\ncontemplate a reformation of his own life; he had inquiries made as to\r\nhow St. Louis used to proceed in giving audience to the lower orders; his\r\nintention, he said, was to henceforth follow the footsteps of the most\r\njustice-loving of French kings.  “He set up,” says Commynes, “a public\r\naudience, whereat he gave ear to everybody, and especially to the poor;\r\nI saw him thereat, a week before his death, for two good hours, and I\r\nnever saw him again.  He did not much business at this audience; but at\r\nleast it was enough to keep folks in awe, and especially his own\r\nofficers, of whom he had suspended some for extortion.”  It is but\r\ntoo often a man’s fate to have his life slip from him just as he was\r\nbeginning to make a better use of it.  On the 7th of April, 1498, Charles\r\nVIII. was pleased, after dinner, to go down with the queen into the\r\nfosses of the castle of Amboise, to see a game of tennis.  Their way lay\r\nthrough a gallery the opening of which was very low; and the king, short\r\nas he was, hit his forehead.  Though he was a little dizzy with the blow,\r\nhe did not stop, watched the players for some time, and even conversed\r\nwith several persons; but about two in the afternoon, whilst he was a\r\nsecond time traversing this passage on his way back to the castle, he\r\nfell backwards and lost consciousness.  He was laid upon a paltry\r\npaillasse in that gallery where everybody went in and out at pleasure;\r\nand in that wretched place, after a lapse of nine hours, expired “he,”\r\n says Commynes, “who had so many fine houses, and who was making so fine\r\nan one at Amboise; so small a matter is our miserable life, which giveth\r\nus so much trouble for the things of the world, and kings cannot help\r\nthemselves any more than peasants.  I arrived at Amboise two days after\r\nhis decease; I went to say mine orison at the spot where was the corpse;\r\nand there I was for five or six hours.  And, of a verity, there was never\r\nseen the like mourning, nor that lasted so long; he was so good that\r\nbetter creature cannot be seen; the most humane and gentle address that\r\never was was his; I trow that to never a man spake he aught that could\r\ndisplease; and at a better hour could he never have died for to remain of\r\ngreat renown in histories and regretted by those that served him.  I trow\r\nI was the man to whom he showed most roughness; but knowing that it was\r\nin his youth, and that it did not proceed from him, I never bore him\r\nill-will for it.”\r\n\r\nProbably no king was ever thus praised for his goodness, and his goodness\r\nalone, by a man whom he had so maltreated, and who, as judicious and\r\nindependent as he was just, said of this same king, “He was not better\r\noff for sense than for money, and he thought of nothing but pastime and\r\nhis pleasures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.----THE WARS IN ITALY.--LOUIS XII. 1498-1515.\r\n\r\nOn ascending the throne Louis XII.  reduced the public taxes and\r\nconfirmed in their posts his predecessor’s chief advisers, using to Louis\r\nde la Tremoille, who had been one of his most energetic foes, that\r\ncelebrated expression, “The King of France avenges not the wrongs of the\r\nDuke of Orleans.”  At the same time, on the day of his coronation at\r\nRheims [May 27, 1492], he assumed, besides his title of King of France,\r\nthe titles of King of Naples and of Jerusalem and Duke of Milan.  This\r\nwas as much as to say that he would pursue a pacific and conservative\r\npolicy at home and a warlike and adventurous policy abroad.  And, indeed,\r\nhis government did present these two phases, so different and\r\ninharmonious.  By his policy at home Louis XII. deserved and obtained the\r\nname of Father of the People; by his enterprises and wars abroad he\r\ninvolved France still more deeply than Charles VIII. had in that mad\r\ncourse of distant, reckless, and incoherent conquests for which his\r\nsuccessor, Francis I., was destined to pay by capture at Pavia and by the\r\nlamentable treaty of Madrid, in 1526, as the price of his release.  Let\r\nus follow these two portions of Louis XII.’s reign, each separately,\r\nwithout mixing up one with the other by reason of identity of dates.  We\r\nshall thus get at a better understanding and better appreciation of their\r\ncharacter and their results.\r\n\r\nOutside of France, Milaness [the Milanese district] was Louis XII.’s\r\nfirst thought, at his accession, and the first object of his desire.  He\r\nlooked upon it as his patrimony.  His grandmother, Valentine Visconti,\r\nwidow of that Duke of Orleans who had been assassinated at Paris in 1407\r\nby order of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, had been the last to\r\ninherit the duchy of Milan, which the Sforzas, in 1450, had seized.\r\nWhen Charles VIII. invaded Italy in 1494, “Now is the time,” said Louis,\r\n“to enforce the rights of Valentine Visconti, my grandmother, to\r\nMilaness.”  And he, in fact, asserted them openly, and proclaimed his\r\nintention of vindicating them so soon as he found the moment propitious.\r\nWhen he became king, his chance of success was great.  The Duke of\r\nMilan, Ludovic, the Moor, had by his sagacity and fertile mind, by his\r\ntaste for arts and sciences and the intelligent patronage he bestowed\r\nupon them, by his ability in speaking, and by his facile character,\r\nobtained in Italy a position far beyond his real power. Leonardo da\r\nVinci, one of the most eminent amongst the noble geniuses of the age,\r\nlived on intimate terms with him; but Ludovic was, nevertheless, a\r\nturbulent rascal and a greedy tyrant, of whom those who did not profit\r\nby his vices or the enjoyments of his court were desirous of being\r\nrelieved.  He had, moreover, embroiled himself with his neighbors the\r\nVenetians, who were watching for an opportunity of aggrandizing\r\nthemselves at his expense.  As early as the 20th of April, 1498, a\r\nfortnight after his accession, Louis XII. addressed to the Venetians a\r\nletter “most gracious,” says the contemporary chronicler Marino Sanuto,\r\n“and testifying great good-will;” and the special courier who brought it\r\ndeclared that the king had written to nobody in Italy except the pope,\r\nthe Venetians, and the Florentines.  The Venetians did not care to\r\nneglect such an opening; and they at once sent three ambassadors to\r\nLouis XII.  Louis heard the news thereof with marked satisfaction.  “I\r\nhave never seen Zorzi,” said he, “but I know him well; as for Loredano,\r\nI like him much; he has been at this court before, some time ago.”  He\r\ngave them a reception on the 12th of August, at Etampes, “not in a\r\npalace,” says one of the senate’s private correspondents, “but at the\r\nFountain inn. You will tell me that so great a king ought not to put up\r\nat an inn; but I shall answer you that in this district of Etampes the\r\nbest houses are as yet the inns.  There is certainly a royal castle, in\r\nthe which lives the queen, the wife of the deceased king; nevertheless\r\nhis Majesty was pleased to give audience in this hostelry, all covered\r\nexpressly with cloth of Alexandrine velvet, with lilies of gold at the\r\nspot where the king was placed.  As soon as the speech was ended, his\r\nMajesty rose up and gave quite a brotherly welcome to the brilliant\r\nambassadors.  The king has a very good countenance, a smiling\r\ncountenance; he is forty years of age, and appears very active in make.\r\nTo-day, Monday, August 13, the ambassadors were received at a private\r\naudience.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis XII----310]\r\n\r\nA treaty concluded on the 9th of February, 1499, and published as signed\r\nat Blois no earlier than the 15th of April following, was the result of\r\nthis negotiation.  It provided for an alliance between the King of France\r\nand the Venetian government, for the purpose of making war in common upon\r\nthe Duke of Milan, Ludovic Sforza, on and against every one, save the\r\nlord pope of Rome, and for the purpose of insuring to the Most Christian\r\nking restoration to the possession of the said duchy of Milan as his\r\nrightful and olden patrimony.  And on account of the charges and expenses\r\nwhich would be incurred by the Venetian government whilst rendering\r\nassistance to the Most Christian king in the aforesaid war, the Most\r\nChristian king bound himself to approve and consent that the city of\r\nCremona and certain forts or territories adjacent, specially indicated,\r\nshould belong in freehold and perpetuity to the Venetian government.  The\r\ntreaty, at the same time, regulated the number of troops and the military\r\ndetails of the war on behalf of the two contracting powers, and it\r\nprovided for divers political incidents which might be entailed, and to\r\nwhich the alliance thus concluded should or should not be applicable\r\naccording to the special stipulations which were drawn up with a view to\r\nthose very incidents.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1499, the French army, with a strength of from\r\ntwenty to five and twenty thousand men, of whom five thousand were Swiss,\r\ninvaded Milaness.  Duke Ludovic Sforza opposed to it a force pretty\r\nnearly equal in number, but far less full of confidence and of far less\r\nvalor.  In less than three weeks the duchy was conquered; in only two\r\ncases was any assault necessary; all the other places were given up by\r\ntraitors or surrendered without a show of resistance.  The Venetians had\r\nthe same success on the eastern frontier of the duchy.  Milan and Cremona\r\nalone remained to be occupied.  Ludovic Sforza “appeared before his\r\ntroops and his people like the very spirit of lethargy,” says a\r\ncontemporary unpublished chronicle, “with his head bent down to the\r\nearth, and for a long while he remained thus pensive and without a single\r\nword to say.  Howbeit he was not so discomfited but that on that very\r\nsame day he could get his luggage packed, his transport-train under\r\norders, his horses shod, his ducats, with which he had more than thirty\r\nmules laden, put by, and, in short, everything in readiness to decamp\r\nnext morning as early as possible.”  Just as he left Milan, he said to\r\nthe Venetian ambassadors, “You have brought the King of France to dinner\r\nwith me; I warn you that he will come to supper with you.”\r\n\r\n“Unless necessity constrain him thereto,” says Machiavelli [treatise Du\r\nPrince, ch.  xxi.], “a prince ought never to form alliance with one\r\nstronger than himself in order to attack others, for, the most powerful\r\nbeing victor, thou remainest, thyself, at his discretion, and princes\r\nought to avoid, as much as ever they can, being at another’s discretion.\r\nThe Venetians allied themselves with France against the Duke of Milan;\r\nand yet they might have avoided this alliance, which entailed their\r\nruin.”  For all his great and profound intellect, Machiavelli was wrong\r\nabout this event and the actors in it.  The Venetians did not deserve his\r\ncensure.  By allying themselves, in 1499, with Louis XII. against the\r\nDuke of Milan, they did not fall into Louis’s hands, for, between 1499\r\nand 1515, and many times over, they sided alternately with and against\r\nhim, always preserving their independence and displaying it as suited\r\nthem at the moment.  And these vicissitudes in their policy did not bring\r\nabout their ruin, for at the death of Louis XII. their power and\r\nimportance in Southern Europe had not declined.  It was Louis XII. who\r\ndeserved Machiavelli’s strictures for having engaged, by means of\r\ndiplomatic alliances of the most contradictory kind, at one time with the\r\nVenetians’ support, and at another against them, in a policy of distant\r\nand incoherent conquests, without any connection with the national\r\ninterests of France, and, in the long run, without any success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bayard----315]\r\n\r\nLouis was at Lyons when he heard of his army’s victory in Milaness and of\r\nLudovic Sforza’s flight.  He was eager to go and take possession of his\r\nconquest, and, on the 6th of October, 1499, he made his triumphal entry\r\ninto Milan amidst cries of “Hurrah! for France.”  He reduced the heavy\r\nimposts established by the Sforzas, revoked the vexatious game-laws,\r\ninstituted at Milan a court of justice analogous to the French\r\nparliaments, loaded with favors the scholars and artists who were the\r\nhonor of Lombardy, and recrossed the Alps at the end of some weeks,\r\nleaving as governor of Milaness John James Trivulzio, the valiant\r\nCondottiere, who, four years before, had quitted the service of Ferdinand\r\nII., King of Naples, for that of Charles VIII.  Unfortunately Trivulzio\r\nwas himself a Milanese and of the faction of the Guelphs.  He had the\r\npassions of a partisan and the habits of a man of war; and he soon became\r\nas tyrannical and as much detested in Milaness as Ludovic the Moor had\r\nbut lately been.  A plot was formed in favor of the fallen tyrant, who\r\nwas in Germany expecting it, and was recruiting, during expectancy,\r\namongst the Germans and Swiss in order to take advantage of it.  On the\r\n25th of January, 1500, the insurrection broke out; and two months later\r\nLudovic Sforza had once more become master of Milaness, where the French\r\npossessed nothing but the castle of Milan.  In one of the fights brought\r\nabout by this sudden revolution the young Chevalier Bayard, carried away\r\nby the impetuosity of his age and courage, pursued right into Milan the\r\nfoes he was driving before him, without noticing that his French comrades\r\nhad left him; and he was taken prisoner in front of the very palace in\r\nwhich were the quarters of Ludovic Sforza.  The incident created some\r\nnoise around the palace; Ludovic asked what it meant, and was informed\r\nthat a brave and bold gentleman, younger than any of the others, had\r\nentered Milan pell-mell with the combatants he was pursuing, and had been\r\ntaken prisoner by John Bernardino Casaccio, one of the leaders of the\r\ninsurrection.  Ludovic ordered him to be brought up, which was done,\r\nthough not without some disquietude on the part of Bayard’s captor,\r\n“a courteous gentleman, who feared that Lord Ludovico might do him some\r\ndispleasure.”  He resolved himself to be his conductor, after having\r\ndressed him in one of his own robes and made him look like a gentleman.\r\n“Marvelling to see Bayard so young, ‘Come hither, my gentleman,’ said\r\nLudovico: ‘who brought you into the city?’  ‘By my faith, my lord,’\r\nanswered Bayard, who was not a whit abashed, ‘I never imagined I was\r\nentering all alone, and thought surely I was being followed of my\r\ncomrades, who knew more about war than I, for if they had done as I did\r\nthey would, like me, be prisoners.  Howbeit, after my mishap, I laud the\r\nfortune which caused me to fall into the hands of so valiant and discreet\r\na knight as he who has me in holding.’  ‘By your faith,’ asked Ludovico,\r\n‘of how many is the army of the King of France?’  ‘On my soul, my lord,’\r\nanswered Bayard, ‘so far as I can hear, there are fourteen or fifteen\r\nhundred men-at-arms and sixteen or eighteen thousand foot; but they are\r\nall picked men, who are resolved to busy themselves so well this bout\r\nthat they will assure the state of Milan to the king our master; and\r\nmeseems, my lord, that you would surely be in as great safety in Germany\r\nas you are here, for your folks are not the sort to fight us.’  With such\r\nassurance spoke the good knight that Lord Ludovico took pleasure\r\nthere-in, though his say was enough to astound him.  ‘On my faith, my\r\ngentleman,’ said he, as it were in raillery, ‘I have a good mind that the\r\nKing of France’s army and mine should come together, in order that by\r\nbattle it may be known to whom of right belongs this heritage, for I see\r\nno other way to it.’  ‘By my sacred oath, my lord,’ said the good knight,\r\n‘I would that it might be to-morrow, provided that I were out of\r\ncaptivity.’  ‘Verily, that shall not stand in your way,’ said Ludovico,\r\n‘for I will let you go forth, and that presently.  Moreover, ask of me\r\nwhat you will, and I will give it you.’  The good knight, who, on bended\r\nknee, thanked Lord Ludovico for the offers he made him, as there was good\r\nreason he should, then said to him, ‘My lord, I ask of you nothing save\r\nonly that you may be pleased to extend your courtesy so far as to get me\r\nback my horse and my arms that I brought into this city, and so send me\r\naway to my garrison, which is twenty miles hence; you would do me a very\r\ngreat kindness, for which I shall all my life feel bounden to you; and,\r\nbarring my duty to the king my master and saving my honor, I would show\r\nmy gratitude for it in whatsoever it might please you to command me.’\r\n‘In good faith,’ said Lord Ludovico, ‘you shall have presently that which\r\nyou do ask for.’  And then he said to the Lord John Bernardino, ‘At once,\r\nSir Captain, let his horse be found, his arms and all that is his.’\r\n‘My lord,’ answered the captain, ‘it is right easy to find, it is all at\r\nmy quarters.’  He sent forthwith two or three servants, who brought the\r\narms and led up the horse of the good young knight; and Lord Ludovico had\r\nhim armed before his eyes.  When he was accoutred, the young knight\r\nleaped upon his horse without putting foot to stirrup; then he asked for\r\na lance, which was handed to him, and, raising his eyes, he said to Lord\r\nLudovico, ‘My lord, I thank you for the courtesy you have done me; please\r\nGod to pay it back to you.’  He was in a fine large court-yard; then he\r\nbegan to set spurs to his horse, the which gave four or five jumps, so\r\ngayly that it could not be better done; then the young knight gave him a\r\nlittle run, in the which he broke the lance against the ground into five\r\nor six pieces; whereat Lord Ludovico was not over pleased, and said out\r\nloud, ‘If all the men-at-arms of France were like him yonder, I should\r\nhave a bad chance.’  Nevertheless he had a trumpeter told off to conduct\r\nhim to his garrison.”  [Histoire du bon Chevalier sans Peur et sans\r\nReproche, t. i. pp.  212-216.]\r\n\r\nFor Ludovic the Moor’s chance to be bad it was not necessary that the\r\nmen-at-arms of France should all be like Chevalier Bayard.  Louis XII.,\r\nso soon as he heard of the Milanese insurrection, sent into Italy Louis\r\nde la Tremoille, the best of his captains, and the Cardinal d’Amboise,\r\nhis privy councillor and his friend, the former to command the royal\r\ntroops, French and Swiss, and the latter “for to treat about the\r\nreconciliation of the rebel towns, and to deal with everything as if it\r\nwere the king in his own person.”  The campaign did not last long.  The\r\nSwiss who had been recruited by Ludovic and those who were in Louis\r\nXII.’s service had no mind to fight one another; and the former\r\ncapitulated, surrendered the strong place of Novara, and promised to\r\nevacuate the country on condition of a safe-conduct for themselves and\r\ntheir booty.  Ludovic, in extreme anxiety for his own safety, was on the\r\npoint of giving himself up to the French; but, whether by his own free\r\nwill or by the advice of the Swiss who were but lately in his pay, and\r\nwho were now withdrawing; he concealed himself amongst them, putting on a\r\ndisguise, “with his hair turned up under a coif, a collaret round his\r\nneck, a doublet of crimson satin, scarlet hose, and a halberd in his\r\nfist;” but, whether it were that he was betrayed or that he was\r\nrecognized, he, on the 10th of April, 1500, fell into the hands of the\r\nFrench, and was conducted to the quarters of La Tremoille, who said no\r\nmore than, “Welcome, lord.”  Next day, April 11, Louis XII. received near\r\nLyons the news of this capture, “whereat he was right joyous, and had\r\nbonfires lighted, together with devotional processions, giving thanks to\r\nthe Prince of princes for the happy victory he had, by the divine aid,\r\nobtained over his enemies.”  Ludovic was taken to Lyons.  “At the\r\nentrance into the city a great number of gentlemen from the king’s\r\nhousehold were present to meet him; and the provost of the household\r\nconducted him all along the high street to the castle of Pierre-Encise,\r\nwhere he was lodged and placed in security.”  There he passed a\r\nfortnight.  Louis refused to see him, but had him “questioned as to\r\nseveral matters by the lords of his grand council; and, granted that he\r\nhad committed nought but follies, still he spoke right wisely.”  He was\r\nconducted from Pierre-Encise to the castle of Loches in Touraine, where\r\nhe was at first kept in very strict captivity, “without books, paper, or\r\nink,” but it was afterwards less severe.  “He plays at tennis and at\r\ncards,” says a despatch of the Venetian ambassador, Dominic of Treviso,\r\n“and he is fatter than ever.”  [_La Diplomatic Venitienne,_ by M. Armand\r\nBaschet (1862), p. 363.] He died in his prison at the end of eight years,\r\nhaving to the very last great confidence in the future of his name, for\r\nhe wrote, they say, on the wall of his prison these words: “Services\r\nrendered me will count for an heritage.”  And “thus was the duchy of\r\nMilan, within seven months and a half, twice conquered by the French,”\r\n says John d’Auton in his Claronique, “and for the nonce was ended the war\r\nin Lombardy, and the authors thereof were captives and exiles.”\r\n\r\nWhilst matters were thus going on in the north of Italy, Louis XII. was\r\npreparing for his second great Italian venture, the conquest of the\r\nkingdom of Naples, in which his predecessor Charles VIII. had failed.  He\r\nthought to render the enterprise easier by not bearing the whole burden\r\nby himself alone.  On the 11th of November, 1500, he concluded at Grenada\r\n“with Ferdinand and Isabella, King and Queen of Castile and Arragon,” a\r\ntreaty, by which the Kings of France and Spain divided, by anticipation,\r\nbetween them the kingdom of Naples, which they were making an engagement\r\nto conquer together.  Terra di Lavoro and the province of the Abruzzi,\r\nwith the cities of Naples and Gaeta, were to be the share of Louis XII.,\r\nwho would assume the title of King of Naples and of Jerusalem; Calabria\r\nand Puglia (Apulia), with the title of duchies, would belong to the King\r\nof Spain, to whom Louis XII., in order to obtain this chance of an\r\naccessary and precarious kingship, gave up entirely Roussillon and\r\nCerdagne, that French frontier of the Pyrenees which Louis XI. had\r\npurchased, a golden bargain, from John II., King of Arragon.  In this\r\narrangement there was a blemish and a danger of which the superficial and\r\nreckless policy of Louis XII. made no account: he did not here, as he had\r\ndone for the conquest of Milaness, join himself to an ally of far\r\ninferior power to his own, and of ambition confined within far narrower\r\nboundaries, as was the case when the Venetians supported him against\r\nLudovie Sforza: he was choosing for his comrade, in a far greater\r\nenterprise, his nearest and most powerful rival, and the most dexterous\r\nrascal amongst the kings of his day.  “The King of France,” said\r\nFerdinand one day, “complains that I have deceived him twice; he lies,\r\nthe drunkard; I have deceived him more than ten times.”  Whether this\r\nbarefaced language were or were not really used, it expressed nothing but\r\nthe truth: mediocre men, who desire to remain pretty nearly honest, have\r\nalways the worst of it, and are always dupes when they ally themselves\r\nwith men who are corrupt and at the same time able, indifferent to good\r\nand evil, to justice and iniquity.  Louis XII., even with the Cardinal\r\nd’Amboise to advise him, was neither sufficiently judicious to abstain\r\nfrom madly conceived enterprises, nor sufficiently scrupulous and\r\nclear-sighted to unmask and play off every act of perfidy and wickedness:\r\nby uniting himself, for the conquest and partition of the kingdom of\r\nNaples, with Ferdinand the Catholic, he was bringing upon himself first\r\nof all hidden opposition in the very midst of joint action, and\r\nafterwards open treason and defection.  He forgot, moreover, that\r\nFerdinand had at the head of his armies a tried chieftain, Gonzalvo of\r\nCordova, already known throughout Europe as the great captain, who had\r\nwon that name in campaigns against the Moors, the Turks, and the\r\nPortuguese, and who had the character of being as free from scruple as\r\nfrom fear.  Lastly the supporters who, at the very commencement of his\r\nenterprises in Italy, had been sought and gained by Louis XII., Pope\r\nAlexander VI. and his son Caesar Borgia, were as little to be depended\r\nupon in the future as they were compromising at the present by reason of\r\ntheir reputation for unbridled ambition, perfidy, and crime.  The King of\r\nFrance, whatever sacrifices he might already have made and might still\r\nmake in order to insure their co-operation, could no more count upon it\r\nthan upon the loyalty of the King of Spain in the conquest they were\r\nentering upon together.\r\n\r\nThe outset of the campaign was attended with easy success.  The French\r\narmy, under the command of Stuart d’Aubigny, a valiant Scot, arrived on\r\nthe 25th of June, 1501, before Rome, and there received a communication\r\nin the form of a bull of the pope which removed the crown of Naples from\r\nthe head of Frederick III., and partitioned that fief of the Holy See\r\nbetween the Kings of France and Spain.  Fortified with this authority,\r\nthe army continued its march, and arrived before Capua on the 6th of\r\nJuly.  Gonzalvo of Cordova was already upon Neapolitan territory with a\r\nSpanish army, which Ferdinand the Catholic had hastily sent thither at\r\nthe request of Frederick III. himself, who had counted upon the\r\nassistance of his cousin the King of Arragon against the French invasion.\r\nGreat was his consternation when he heard that the ambassadors of France\r\nand Spain had proclaimed at Rome the alliance between their masters.  At\r\nthe first rumor of this news, Gonzalvo of Cordova, whether sincerely or\r\nnot, treated it as a calumny; but, so soon as its certainty was made\r\npublic, he accepted it without hesitation, and took, equally with the\r\nFrench, the offensive against the king, already dethroned by the pope,\r\nand very near being so by the two sovereigns who had made alliance for\r\nthe purpose of sharing between them the spoil they should get from him.\r\nCapua capitulated, and was nevertheless plundered and laid waste.  A\r\nFrench fleet, commanded by Philip de Ravenstein, arrived off Naples when\r\nD’Aubigny was already master of it.  The unhappy King Frederick took\r\nrefuge in the island of Ischia; and, unable to bear the idea of seeking\r\nan asylum in Spain with his cousin who had betrayed him so shamefully,\r\nhe begged the French admiral himself to advise him in his adversity.  “As\r\nenemies that have the advantage should show humanity to the afflicted,”\r\n Ravenstein sent word to him, “he would willingly advise him as to his\r\naffairs; according to his advice, the best thing would be to surrender\r\nand place himself in the hands of the King of France, and submit to his\r\ngood pleasure; he would find him so wise, and so debonnair, and so\r\naccommodating, that he would be bound to be content.  Better or safer\r\ncounsel for him he had not to give.”  After taking some precautions on\r\nthe score of his eldest son, Prince Ferdinand, whom he left at Tarento,\r\nin the kingdom he was about to quit, Frederick III. followed Ravenstein’s\r\ncounsel, sent to ask for “a young gentleman to be his guide to France,”\r\n put to sea with five hundred men remaining to him, and arrived at\r\nMarseilles, whither Louis XII. sent some lords of his court to receive\r\nhim.  Two months afterwards, and not before, he was conducted to the king\r\nhimself, who was then at Blois.  Louis welcomed him with his natural\r\nkindness, and secured to him fifty thousand livres a year on the duchy of\r\nAnjou, on condition that he never left France.  It does not appear that\r\nFrederick ever had an idea of doing so, for his name is completely lost\r\nto history up to the day of his death, which took place at Tours on the\r\n9th of November, 1504, after three years’ oblivion and exile.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of so prompt a success, Louis XII.’s satisfaction was great.\r\nHe believed, and many others, no doubt, believed with him, that his\r\nconquest of Naples, of that portion at least which was assigned to him\r\nby his treaty with the King of Spain, was accomplished.  The senate of\r\nVenice sent to him, in December, 1501, a solemn embassy to congratulate\r\nhim.  In giving the senate an account of his mission, one of the\r\nambassadors, Dominic of Treviso, drew the following portrait of\r\nLouis XII.: “The king is in stature tall and thin, and temperate in\r\neating, taking scarcely anything but boiled beef; he is by nature miserly\r\nand retentive; his great pleasure is hawking; from September to April he\r\nhawks.  The Cardinal of Rouen [George d’Amboise] does everything;\r\nnothing, however, with-out the cognizance of the king, who has a far from\r\nstable mind, saying yes and no.  .  .  .  I am of opinion that their\r\nlordships should remove every suspicion from his Majesty’s mind, and aim\r\nat keeping themselves closely united with him.”  [Armand Baschet, _La\r\nDiplomatic, L’enitienne_, p.  362.]  It was not without ground that the\r\nVenetian envoy gave his government this advice.  So soon as the treaty of\r\nalliance between Louis XII. and the Venetians for the conquest of\r\nMilaness had attained its end, the king had more than once felt and\r\ntestified some displeasure at the demeanor assumed towards him by his\r\nformer allies.  They had shown vexation and disquietude at the extension\r\nof French influence in Italy; and they had addressed to Louis certain\r\nrepresentations touching the favor enjoyed at his hands by the pope’s\r\nnephew, Caesar Borgia, to whom he had given the title of Duke of\r\nValentinois on investing him with the countships of Valence and of Die in\r\nDauphiny.  Louis, on his side, showed anxiety as to the conduct which\r\nwould be exhibited towards him by the Venetians if he encountered any\r\nembarrassment in his expedition to Naples.  Nothing of the kind happened\r\nto him during the first month after King Frederick III.’s abandonment of\r\nthe kingdom of Naples.  The French and the Spaniards, D’Aubigny and\r\nGonzalvo of Cordova, at first gave their attention to nothing but\r\nestablishing themselves firmly, each in the interests of the king his\r\nmaster, in those portions of the kingdom which were to belong to them.\r\n\r\nBut, before long, disputes arose between the two generals as to the\r\nmeaning of certain clauses in the treaty of November 11, 1500, and as to\r\nthe demarcation of the French and the Spanish territories.  D’Aubigny\r\nfell ill; and Louis XII. sent to Naples, with the title of viceroy, Louis\r\nd’Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, a brave warrior, but a negotiator inclined\r\nto take umbrage and to give offence.  The disputes soon took the form of\r\nhostilities.  The French essayed to drive the Spaniards from the points\r\nthey had occupied in the disputed territories; and at first they had the\r\nadvantage.  Gonzalvo of Cordova, from necessity or in prudence,\r\nconcentrated his forces within Barletta, a little fortress with a little\r\nport on the Adriatic; but he there endured, from July, 1502, to April,\r\n1503, a siege which did great honor to the patient firmness of the\r\nSpanish troops and the persistent vigor of their captain.  Gonzalvo was\r\ngetting ready to sally from Barletta and take the offensive against the\r\nFrench when he heard that a treaty signed at Lyons on the 5th of April,\r\n1503, between the Kings of Spain and France, made a change in the\r\nposition, reciprocally, of the two sovereigns, and must suspend the\r\nmilitary operations of their generals within the kingdom of Naples.\r\n“The French general declared his readiness to obey his king,” says\r\nGuicciardini; “but the Spanish, whether it were that he felt sure of\r\nvictory or that he had received private instructions on that point, said\r\nthat he could not stop the war without express orders from his king.”\r\n And sallying forthwith from Barletta, he gained, on the 28th of April,\r\n1503, at Cerignola, a small town of Puglia, a signal victory over the\r\nFrench commanded by the Duke of Nemours, who, together with three\r\nthousand men of his army, was killed in action.  The very day after his\r\nsuccess Gonzalvo heard that a Spanish corps, lately disembarked in\r\nCalabria, had also beaten, on the 21st of April, at Seminara, a French\r\ncorps commanded by D’Aubigny.  The great captain was as eager to profit\r\nby victory as he had been patient in waiting for a chance of it.  He\r\nmarched rapidly on Naples, and entered it on the 14th of May, almost\r\nwithout resistance; and the two forts defending the city, the Castel\r\nNuovo and the Castel dell’ Uovo surrendered, one on the 11th of June and\r\nthe other on the 1st of July.  The capital of the kingdom having thus\r\nfallen into the hands of the Spaniards, Capua and Aversa followed its\r\nexample.  Gaeta was the only important place which still held out for the\r\nFrench, and contained a garrison capable of defending it; and thither the\r\nremnant of the troops beaten at Seminara and at Cerignola had retired.\r\nLouis XII. hastened to levy and send to Italy, under the command of Louis\r\nde la Tremoille, a fresh army for the purpose of relieving Gaeta and\r\nrecovering Naples; but at Parma La Tremoille fell ill, “so crushed by his\r\nmalady and so despairing of life,” says his chronicler, John Bouchet,\r\n“that the physicians sent word to the king that it was impossible in the\r\nway of nature to recover him, and that without the divine assistance he\r\ncould not get well.”  The command devolved upon the Marquis of Mantua,\r\nwho marched on Gaeta.  He found Gonzalvo of Cordova posted with his army\r\non the left bank of the Garigliano, either to invest the place or to\r\nrepulse re-enforcements that might arrive for it.  The two armies passed\r\nfifty days face to face almost, with the river and its marshes between\r\nthem, and vainly attempting over and over again to join battle.  Some of\r\nGonzalvo’s officers advised him to fall back on Capua, so as to withdraw\r\nhis troops from an unhealthy and difficult position; but “I would\r\nrather,” said he, “have here, for my grave, six feet of earth by pushing\r\nforward, than prolong my life a hundred years by falling back, though it\r\nwere but a few arms’ lengths.”  The French army was dispersing about in\r\nsearch of shelter and provisions; and the Marquis of Mantua, disgusted\r\nwith the command, resigned it to the Marquis of Saluzzo, and returned\r\nhome to his marquisate.  Gonzalvo, who was kept well informed of his\r\nenemies’ condition, threw, on the 27th of December, a bridge over the\r\nGarigliano, attacked the French suddenly, and forced them to fall back\r\nupon Gaeta, which they did not succeed in entering until they had lost\r\nartillery, baggage, and a number of prisoners.  “The Spaniards,” says\r\nJohn d’Auton, “halted before the place, made as if they would lay siege\r\nto it, and so remained for two or three days.  The French, who were there\r\nin great numbers, had scarcely any provisions, and could not hold out for\r\nlong; however, they put a good face upon it.  The captain, Gonzalvo, sent\r\nword to them that if they would surrender their town he would, on his\r\npart, restore to them without ransom all prisoners and others of their\r\nparty; and he had many of them, James de la Palisse, Stuart d’Aubigny,\r\nGaspard de Coligny, Anthony de la Fayette, &c., all captains.  The French\r\ncaptains, seeing that fortune was not kind to them, and that they had\r\nprovisions for a week only, were all for taking this offer.  All the\r\nprisoners, captains, men-at-arms, and common soldiers were accordingly\r\ngiven up, put to sea, and sailed for Genoa, where they were well received\r\nand kindly treated by the Genoese, which did them great good, for they\r\nwere much in need of it.  Nearly all the captains died on their return,\r\nsome of mourning over their losses, others of melancholy at their\r\nmisfortune, others for fear of the king’s displeasure, and others of\r\nsickness and weariness.”  [_Chroniques of John d’Auton,_ t. iii.\r\npp. 68-70.]\r\n\r\nGaeta fell into the hands of the Spaniards on the 1st of January, 1504.\r\nThe war was not ended, but the kingdom of Naples was lost to the King of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAt the news of these reverses the grief and irritation of Louis XII.\r\nwere extreme.  Not only was he losing his Neapolitan conquests, but even\r\nhis Milaness was also threatened.  The ill-will of the Venetians became\r\nmanifest.  They had re-victualled by sea the fortress of Barletta, in\r\nwhich Gonzalvo of Cordova had shut himself up with his troops; “and when\r\nthe king presented complaints of this succor afforded to his enemies, the\r\nsenate replied that the matter had taken place without their cognizance,\r\nthat Venice was a republic of traders, and that private persons might\r\nvery likely have sold provisions to the Spaniards, with whom Venice was\r\nat peace, without there being any ground for concluding from it that she\r\nhad failed in her engagements towards France.  Some time afterwards, four\r\nFrench galleys, chased by a Spanish squadron of superior force, presented\r\nthemselves before the port of Otranto, which was in the occupation of the\r\nVenetians, who pleaded their neutrality as a reason for refusing asylum\r\nto the French squadron, which the commander was obliged to set on fire\r\nthat it might not fall into he enemy’s hands.”  [_Histoire de la\r\nRepublique de L’enise,_ by Count Daru, t. iii.  p. 245.] The determined\r\nprosecution of hostilities in the kingdom of Naples by Gonzalvo of\r\nCordova, in spite of the treaty concluded at Lyons on the 5th of April,\r\n1503, between the Kings of France and Spain, was so much the more\r\noffensive to Louis XII. in that this treaty was the consequence and the\r\nconfirmation of an enormous concession which he had, two years\r\npreviously, made to the King of Spain on consenting to affiance his\r\ndaughter, Princess Claude of France, two years old, to Ferdinand’s\r\ngrandson, Charles of Austria, who was then only one year old, and who\r\nbecame Charles the Fifth (emperor)!  Lastly, about the same time, Pope\r\nAlexander VI., who, willy hilly, had rendered Louis XII. so many\r\nservices, died at Rome on the 12th of August, 1503.  Louis had hoped that\r\nhis favorite minister, Cardinal George d’Amboise, would succeed him, and\r\nthat hope had a great deal to do with the shocking favor he showed Caesar\r\nBorgia, that infamous son of a demoralized father.  But the candidature\r\nof Cardinal d’Amboise failed; a four weeks’ pope, Pius III., succeeded\r\nAlexander VI.; and, when the Holy See suddenly became once more vacant,\r\nCardinal d’Amboise failed again; and the new choice was Cardinal Julian\r\ndella Rovera, Pope Julius II., who soon became the most determined and\r\nmost dangerous foe of Louis XII., already assailed by so many enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian, Dominic of Treviso, was quite right; Louis XII. was “of\r\nunstable mind, saying yes and no.”  On such characters discouragement\r\ntells rapidly.  In order to put off the struggle which had succeeded so\r\nill for him in the kingdom of Naples, Louis concluded, on the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1504, a truce for three years with the King of Spain; and on the\r\n22d of September, in the same year, in order to satisfy his grudge on\r\naccount of the Venetians’ demeanor towards him, he made an alliance\r\nagainst them with Emperor Maximilian I. and Pope Julius II., with the\r\ndesign, all three of them, of wresting certain provinces from them.  With\r\nthose political miscalculations was connected a more personal and more\r\ndisinterested feeling.  Louis repented of having in 1501 affianced his\r\ndaughter Claude to Prince Charles of Austria, and of the enormous\r\nconcessions he had made by two treaties, one of April 5, 1503, and the\r\nother of September 22, 1504, for the sake of this marriage.  He had\r\nassigned as dowry to his daughter, first the duchy of Milan, then the\r\nkingdom of Naples, then Brittany, and then the duchy of Burgundy and the\r\ncountship of Blois.  The latter of these treaties contained even the\r\nfollowing strange clause: “If, by default of the Most Christian king or\r\nof the queen his wife, or of the Princess Claude, the aforesaid marriage\r\nshould not take place, the Most Christian king doth will and consent,\r\nfrom now, that the said duchies of Burgundy and Milan and the countship\r\nof Asti, do remain settled upon the said Prince Charles, Duke of\r\nLuxembourg, with all the rights therein possessed, or possibly to be\r\npossessed, by the Most Christian king.”  [_Corps Diplomatique du Droit\r\ndes Gens,_ by J.  Dumont, t.  iv.  part i.  p.  57.] It was dismembering\r\nFrance, and at the same time settling on all her frontiers, to east,\r\nwest, and south-west, as well as to north and south, a power which the\r\napproaching union of two crowns, the imperial and the Spanish, on the\r\nhead of Prince Charles of Austria, rendered so preponderating and so\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\nIt was not only from considerations of external policy, and in order to\r\nconciliate to himself Emperor Maximilian and King Ferdinand, that Louis\r\nXII. had allowed himself to proceed to concessions so plainly contrary to\r\nthe greatest interests of France: he had yielded also to domestic\r\ninfluences.  The queen his wife, Anne of Brittany, detested Louise of\r\nSavoy, widow of Charles d’Orleans, Count of Angouleme, and mother of\r\nFrancis d’Angouleme, heir presumptive to the throne, since Louis XII.\r\nhad no son.  Anne could not bear the idea that her daughter, Princess\r\nClaude, should marry the son of her personal enemy; and, being more\r\nBreton than French, say her contemporaries, she, in order to avoid this\r\ndisagreeableness, had used with the king all her influence, which was\r\ngreat, in favor of the Austrian marriage, caring little, and, perhaps,\r\neven desiring, that Brittany should be again severed from France.  Louis,\r\nin the midst of the reverses of his diplomacy, had thus to suffer from\r\nthe hatreds of his wife, the observations of his advisers, and the\r\nreproaches of his conscience as a king.  He fell so ill that he was\r\nsupposed to be past recovery.  “It were to do what would be incredible,”\r\n says his contemporary, John de St. Gelais, “to write or tell of the\r\nlamentations made throughout the whole realm of France, by reason of the\r\nsorrow felt by all for the illness of their good king.  There were to be\r\nseen night and day, at Blois, at Amboise, at Tours, and everywhere else,\r\nmen and women going all bare throughout the churches and to the holy\r\nplaces, in order to obtain from divine mercy grace of health and\r\nconvalescence for one whom there was as great fear of losing as if he had\r\nbeen the father of each.”  Louis was touched by this popular sympathy;\r\nand his wisest councillors, Cardinal d’Amboise the first of all, took\r\nadvantage thereof to appeal to his conscience in respect of the\r\nengagements which “through weakness he had undertaken contrary to the\r\ninterests of the realm and the coronation-promises.”  Queen Anne herself,\r\nnot without a struggle, however, at last gave up her opposition to this\r\npatriotic recoil; and on the 10th of May, 1505, Louis XII.  put in his\r\nwill a clause to the effect that his daughter, Princess Claude, should be\r\nmarried, so soon as she was old enough, to the heir to the throne,\r\nFrancis, Count of Angouleme.  Only it was agreed, in order to avoid\r\ndiplomatic embarrassments, that this arrangement should be kept secret\r\ntill further notice.  [The will itself of Louis XII. has been inserted in\r\nthe _Recueil des Ordonnances des Bois des France,_ t. xxi.  p. 323, dated\r\n30th of May, 1505.]\r\n\r\nWhen Louis had recovered, discreet measures were taken for arousing the\r\nfeeling of the country as well as the king’s conscience as to this great\r\nquestion.  In the course of the year 1505 there took place throughout the\r\nwhole kingdom, amongst the nobility and in the principal towns,\r\nassemblies at which means were proposed for preventing this evil.\r\nUnpleasant consequences might have been apprehended from these meetings,\r\nin the case of a prince less beloved by his subjects than the king was;\r\nbut nothing further was decided thereby than that a representation should\r\nwith submission be made to him of the dangers likely to result from this\r\ntreaty, that he should be entreated to prevent them by breaking it, and\r\nthat a proposal should be made to him to assemble the estates to\r\ndeliberate upon a subject so important.  [_Histoire de France,_ by Le\r\nPere Daniel, t. viii.  p. 427, edit. of 1755.] The states-general were\r\naccordingly convoked and met at Tours on the 10th of May, 1506; and on\r\nthe 14th of May Louis XII. opened them in person at Plessis-les-Tours,\r\nseated in a great hall, in the royal seat, between Cardinal d’Amboise and\r\nDuke Francis of Valois, and surrounded by many archbishops and all the\r\nprinces of the blood and other lords and barons of the said realm in\r\ngreat number, and he gave the order for admitting the deputies of the\r\nestates of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATES GENERAL AT TOURS----329]\r\n\r\n“Far from setting forth the grievances of the nation, as the spokesman of\r\nthe estates had always done, Thomas Bricot, canon of Notre-Dame de Paris,\r\ndelivered an address enumerating, in simple and touching terms, the\r\nbenefits conferred by Louis XII., and describing to him the nation’s\r\ngratitude.  To him they owed peace and the tranquillity of the realm,\r\ncomplete respect for private property, release from a quarter of the\r\ntalliages, reform in the administration of justice, and the appointment\r\nof enlightened and incorruptible judges.  For these causes, the speaker\r\nadded, and for others which it would take too long to recount, he was\r\ndestined to be known as Louis XII., father of the people.\r\n\r\n“At these last words loud cheers rang out; emotion was general, and\r\nreached the king himself, who shed tears at hearing the title which\r\nposterity and history were forever to attach to his name.\r\n\r\n“Then, the deputies having dropped on their knees, the speaker resumed\r\nhis speech, saying that they were come to prefer a request for the\r\ngeneral good of the realm, the king’s subjects entreating him to be\r\npleased to give his only daughter in marriage to my lord Francis, here\r\npresent, who is every whit French.\r\n\r\n“When this declaration was ended, the king called Cardinal d’Amboise and\r\nthe chancellor, with whom he conferred for some time; and then the\r\nchancellor, turning to the deputies, made answer that the king had given\r\ndue ear and heed to their request and representation, .  .  .  that if he\r\nhad done well, he desired to do still better; and that, as to the request\r\ntouching the marriage, he had never heard talk of it; but that as to that\r\nmatter, he would communicate with the princes of the blood, so as to have\r\ntheir opinion.\r\n\r\n“The day after this session the king received an embassy which could not\r\nbut crown his joy: the estates of the duchy of Burgundy, more interested\r\nthan any other province in the rupture of the (Austrian) marriage, had\r\nsent deputies to join their most urgent prayers to the entreaties of the\r\nestates of France.\r\n\r\n“On Monday, May 18, the king assembled about him his chief councillors,\r\nto learn if the demand of the estates was profitable and reasonable for\r\nhim and his kingdom.  ‘Thereon,’ continues the report, ‘the first to\r\ndeliver an opinion was my lord the Bishop of Paris; after him the premier\r\npresident of the parliament of Paris and of that of Bordeaux.’ Their\r\nspeeches produced such effect that, ‘quite with one voice and one\r\nmind, those present agreed that the request of the estates was sound,\r\njust, and reasonable, and with one consent entreated the king to agree to\r\nthe said marriage.’\r\n\r\n“The most enlightened councillors and the princes of the blood found\r\nthemselves in agreement with the commons.  There was no ambiguity about\r\nthe reply.  On the Tuesday, May 19, the king held a session in state for\r\nthe purpose of announcing to the estates that their wishes should be\r\nfully gratified, and that the betrothal of his daughter to the heir to\r\nthe throne should take place next day but one, May 21, in order that the\r\ndeputies might report the news of it to their constituents.\r\n\r\n“After that the estates had returned thanks, the chancellor gave notice\r\nthat, as municipal affairs imperatively demanded the return of the\r\ndeputies, the king gave them leave to go, retaining only one burgess from\r\neach town, to inform him of their wants and ‘their business, if such\r\nthere be in any case, wherein the king will give them good and short\r\ndespatch.’\r\n\r\n“The session was brought to a close by the festivities of the betrothal,\r\nand by the oath taken by the deputies, who, before their departure, swore\r\nto bring about with all their might, even to the risk of body and goods,\r\nthe marriage which had just been decided upon by the common advice of all\r\nthose who represented France.’” [_Histoire des Etats Generaux_ from 1355\r\nto 1614, by George Picot, t. i.  pp. 352-354].\r\n\r\nFrancis d’Angouleme was at that time eleven years old, and Claude of\r\nFrance was nearly seven.\r\n\r\nWhatever displeasure must have been caused to the Emperor of Germany and\r\nto the King of Spain by this resolution on the part of France and her\r\nking, it did not show itself, either in acts of hostility or even in\r\ncomplaints of a more or less threatening kind.  Italy remained for some\r\nyears longer the sole theatre of rivalry and strife between these three\r\ngreat powers; and, during this strife, the utter diversity of the\r\ncombinations, whether in the way of alliance or of rupture, bore witness\r\nto the extreme changeability of the interests, passions, and designs of\r\nthe actors.  From 1506 to 1515, between Louis XII.’s will and his death,\r\nwe find in the history of his career in Italy five coalitions, and as\r\nmany great battles, of a profoundly contradictory character.  In 1508,\r\nPope Julius II., Louis XII., Emperor Maximilian, and Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, King of Spain, form together against the Venetians the League\r\nof Cambrai.  In 1510, Julius II., Ferdinand, the Venetians, and the Swiss\r\nmake a coalition against Louis XII.  In 1512, this coalition, decomposed\r\nfor a while, re-unites, under the name of the League of the Holy Union,\r\nbetween the pope, the Venetians, the Swiss, and the Kings of Arragon and\r\nNaples against Louis XII., minus the Emperor Maximilian, and plus Henry\r\nVIII., King of England.  On the 14th of May, 1509, Louis XII., in the\r\nname of the League of Cambrai, gains the battle of Agnadello against the\r\nVenetians.  On the 11th of April, 1512, it is against Pope Julius II.,\r\nFerdinand the Catholic, and the Venetians that he gains the battle of\r\nRavenna.  On the 14th of March, 1513, he is in alliance with the\r\nVenetians, and it is against the Swiss that he loses the battle of\r\nNovara.  In 1510, 1511, and 1512, in the course of all these incessant\r\nchanges of political allies and adversaries, three councils met at Tours,\r\nat Pisa, and at St. John Lateran with views still more discordant and\r\nirreconcilable than those of all these laic coalitions.  We merely point\r\nout here the principal traits of the nascent sixteenth century; we have\r\nno intention of tracing with a certain amount of detail any incidents but\r\nthose that refer to Louis XII. and to France, to their procedure and\r\ntheir fortunes.\r\n\r\nJealousy, ambition, secret resentment, and the prospect of despoiling\r\nthem caused the formation of the League of Cambrai against the Venetians.\r\nTheir far-reaching greatness on the seas, their steady progress on land,\r\ntheir riches, their cool assumption of independence towards the papacy,\r\ntheir renown for ability, and their profoundly selfish, but singularly\r\nprosperous policy, had excited in Italy, and even beyond the Alps, that\r\nfeeling of envy and ill-will which is caused amongst men, whether kings\r\nor people, by the spectacle of strange, brilliant, and unexpected good\r\nfortune, though it be the fruits of rare merit.  As the Venetians were as\r\nmuch dreaded as they were little beloved, great care was taken to conceal\r\nfrom them the projects that were being formed against them.  According to\r\ntheir historian, Cardinal Bembo, they owed to chance the first notice\r\nthey had.  It happened one day that a Piedmontese at Milan, in presence\r\nof the Resident of Venice, allowed to escape from his lips the words,\r\n“I should have the pleasure, then, of seeing the crime punished of those\r\nwho put to death the most illustrious man of my country.”  He alluded to\r\nCarmagnola, a celebrated Piedmontese condottiere, who had been accused of\r\ntreason and beheaded at Venice on the 3d of May, 1432.  The Venetian\r\nambassador at Louis XII.’s court, suspecting what had taken place at\r\nCambrai, tried to dissuade the king.  “Sir,” said he, “it were folly to\r\nattack them of Venice; their wisdom renders them invincible.”  “I believe\r\nthey are prudent and wise,” answered Louis, “but all the wrong way of the\r\nhair (inopportunely); if it must come to war, I will bring upon them so\r\nmany fools, that your wiseacres will not have leisure to teach them\r\nreason, for my fools hit all round without looking where.”  When the\r\nleague was decisively formed, Louis sent to Venice a herald to officially\r\nproclaim war.  After having replied to the grievances alleged in support\r\nof that proclamation, “We should never have believed,” said the Doge\r\nLoredano, “that so great a prince would have given ear to the envenomed\r\nwords of a pope whom he ought to know better, and to the insinuations of\r\nanother priest whom we forbear to mention (Cardinal d’Amboise).  In order\r\nto please them, he declares himself the foe of a republic which has\r\nrendered him great services.  We will try to defend ourselves, and to\r\nprove to him that he has not kept faith with us.  God shall judge betwixt\r\nus.  Father herald, and you, trumpeter, ye have heard what we had to say\r\nto you; report it to your master.  Away!”  Independently of their natural\r\nhaughtiness, the Venetians were puffed up with the advantages they had\r\nobtained in a separate campaign against the Emperor Maximilian, and\r\nflattered themselves that they would manage to conquer, one after the\r\nother, or to split up, or to tire out, their enemies; and they prepared\r\nenergetically for war.  Louis XII., on his side, got together an army\r\nwith a strength of twenty-three hundred lances (about thirteen thousand\r\nmounted troops), ten to twelve thousand French foot, and six or eight\r\nthousand Swiss.  He sent for Chevalier Bayard, already famous, though\r\nstill quite a youth.  “Bayard,” said he, “you know that I am about to\r\ncross the mountains, for to bring to reason the Venetians, who by great\r\nwrong withhold from me the countship of Cremona and other districts.\r\nI give to you from this present time the company of Captain Chatelard,\r\nwho they tell me is dead, whereat I am distressed; but I desire that in\r\nthis enterprise you have under your charge men afoot; your lieutenant-\r\ncaptain, Pierrepont [Pierre de Pont d’Albi, a Savoyard gentle-man, and\r\nBayard’s nephew], who is a very good man, shall lead your men-at-arms.”\r\n “Sir,” answered Bayard, “I will do what pleaseth you; but how many men\r\nafoot will you be pleased to hand over to me to lead?”  “A thousand,”\r\n said the king: “there is no man that hath more.”  “Sir,” replied Bayard,\r\n“it is a many for my poor wits; I do entreat you to be content that I\r\nhave five hundred; and I pledge you my faith, sir, that I will take pains\r\nto choose such as shall do you service; meseems that for one man it is a\r\nvery heavy charge, if he would fain do his duty therewith.”  “Good!” said\r\nthe king: “go, then, quickly into Dauphiny, and take heed that you be in\r\nmy duchy of Milan by the end of March.”  Bayard forthwith set out to\r\nraise and choose his foot; a proof of the growing importance of infantry,\r\nand of the care taken by Louis XII. to have it commanded by men of war of\r\nexperience and popularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of Agnadello----334]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May, 1509, the French army and the Venetian army, of\r\nnearly equal strength, encountered near the village of Agnadello, in the\r\nprovince of Lodi, on the banks of the Adda.  Louis XII. commanded his in\r\nperson, with Louis de la Tremoille and James Trivulzio for his principal\r\nlieutenants; the Venetians were under the orders of two generals, the\r\nCount of Petigliano and Barthelemy d’Alviano, both members of the Roman\r\nfamily of the Orsini, but not on good terms with one another.  The French\r\nhad to cross the Adda to reach the enemy, who kept in his camp.\r\nTrivulzio, seeing that the Venetians did not dispute their passage, cried\r\nout to the king, “To-day, sir, the victory is ours!”  The French advance-\r\nguard engaged with the troops of Alviano.  When apprised of this fight,\r\nLouis, to whom word was at this same time brought that the enemy was\r\nalready occupying the point towards which he was moving with the main\r\nbody of the army, said briskly, “Forward, all the same; we will halt upon\r\ntheir bellies.”  The action became general and hot.  The king, sword in\r\nhand, hurried from one corps to another, under fire from the Venetian\r\nartillery, which struck several men near him.  He was urged to place\r\nhimself under cover a little, so as to give his orders thence; but, “It\r\nis no odds,” said he; “they who are afraid have only to put themselves\r\nbehind me.”  A body of Gascons showed signs of wavering: “Lads,” shouted\r\nLa Tremoille, “the king sees you.”  They dashed forward; and the\r\nVenetians were broken, in spite of the brave resistance of Alviano, who\r\nwas taken and brought, all covered with blood, and with one eye out, into\r\nthe presence of the king.  Louis said to him, courteously, “You shall\r\nhave fair treatment and fair captivity; have fair patience.”  “So I\r\nwill,” answered the condottiere; “if I had won the battle, I had been the\r\nmost victorious man in the world; and, though I have lost it, still have\r\nI the great honor of having had against me a King of France in person.”\r\n Louis, who had often heard talk of the warrior’s intrepid presence of\r\nmind, had a fancy for putting it to further proof, and, all the time\r\nchatting with him, gave secret orders to have the alarm sounded not far\r\nfrom them.  “What is this, pray, Sir Barthelemy?” asked the king: “your\r\nfolks are very difficult to please; is it that they want to begin\r\nagain?”  “Sir,” said Alviano, “if there is fighting still, it must be\r\nthat the French are fighting one another; as for my folks, I assure you,\r\non my life, they will not pay you a visit this fortnight.”  The Venetian\r\narmy, in fact, withdrew with a precipitation which resembled a rout: for,\r\nto rally it, its general, the Count of Petigliano, appointed for its\r\ngathering-point the ground beneath the walls of Brescia, forty miles from\r\nthe field of battle.  “Few men-at-arms,” says Guicciardini, “were slain\r\nin this affair; the great loss fell upon the Venetians’ infantry, which\r\nlost, according to some, eight thousand men; others say that the number\r\nof dead on both sides did not amount to more than six thousand.”  The\r\nterritorial results of the victory were greater than the numerical losses\r\nof the armies.  Within a fortnight, the towns of Caravaggio, Bergamo,\r\nBrescia, Crema, Cremona, and Pizzighitone surrendered to the French.\r\nPeschiera alone, a strong fortress at the southern extremity of the Lake\r\nof Garda, resisted, and was carried by assault.  “It was a bad thing for\r\nthose within,” says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard; “for all, or nearly\r\nall, perished there; amongst the which was the governor of the Signory\r\nand his son, who were willing to pay good and heavy ransom; but that\r\nserved them not at all, for on one tree were both of them hanged, which\r\nto me did seem great cruelty; a very lusty gentleman, called the\r\nLorrainer, had their parole, and he had big words about it with the grand\r\nmaster, lieutenant-general of the king; but he got no good thereby.”  The\r\n_Memoires of Robert de la Marck,_ lord of Fleuranges, and a warrior of\r\nthe day, confirm, as to this sad incident, the story of the Loyal\r\nServiteur of Bayard: “When the French volunteers,” says he, “entered by\r\nthe breach into the castle of Peschiera, they cut to pieces all those who\r\nwere therein, and there were left only the captain, the proveditore, and\r\nthe podesta, the which stowed themselves away in a tower, surrendered to\r\nthe good pleasure of the king, and, being brought before him, offered him\r\nfor ransom a hundred thousand ducats; but the king swore, ‘If ever I eat\r\nor drink till they be hanged and strangled!  ‘Nor even for all the prayer\r\nthey could make could the grand master Chaumont, and even his uncle,\r\nCardinal d’Amboise, find any help for it, but the king would have them\r\nhanged that very hour.”  Some chroniclers attribute this violence on\r\nLouis XII.’s part to a “low and coarse” reply returned by those in\r\ncommand at Peschiera to the summons to surrender.  Guicciardini, whilst\r\nalso recording the fact, explains it otherwise than by a fit of anger on\r\nLouis’s part: “The king,” he says, “was led to such cruelty in order\r\nthat, dismayed at such punishment, those who were still holding out in\r\nthe fortress of Cremona might not defend themselves to the last\r\nextremity.”  [_Guicciardini, Istoria d’Italia,_ liv.  viii.  t.  i.  p.\r\n521.] So that the Italian historian is less severe on this act of cruelty\r\nthan the French knight is.\r\n\r\nLouis XII.’s victory at Agnadello had for him consequences very different\r\nfrom what he had no doubt expected.  “The king,” says Guicciardini,\r\n“departed from Italy, carrying away with him to France great glory by\r\nreason of so complete and so rapidly won a victory over the Venetians;\r\nnevertheless, as in the case of things obtained after hope long deferred\r\nmen scarcely ever feel such joy and happiness as they had at first\r\nimagined they would, the king took not back with him either greater peace\r\nof mind or greater security in respect of his affairs.”  The beaten\r\nVenetians accepted their defeat with such a mixture of humility and\r\ndignity as soon changed their position in Italy.  They began by providing\r\nall that was necessary for the defence of Venice herself; foreigners, but\r\nonly idle foreigners, were expelled; those who had any business which\r\nsecured them means of existence received orders to continue their labors.\r\nMills were built, cisterns were dug, corn was gathered in, the condition\r\nof the canals was examined, bars were removed, the citizens were armed;\r\nthe law which did not allow vessels laden with provisions to touch at\r\nVenice was repealed, and rewards were decreed to officers who had done\r\ntheir duty.  Having taken all this care for their own homes and their\r\nfatherland on the sea, the Venetian senate passed a decree by which the\r\nrepublic, releasing from their oath of fidelity the subjects it could not\r\ndefend, authorized its continental provinces to treat with the enemy with\r\na view to their own interests, and ordered its commandants to evacuate\r\nsuch places as they still held.  Nearly all such submitted without a\r\nstruggle to the victor of Agnadello and his allies of Cambrai; but at\r\nTreviso, when Emperor Maximilian’s commissioner presented himself in\r\norder to take possession of it, a shoemaker named Caligaro went running\r\nthrough the streets, shouting, “Hurrah! for St. Mark.”\r\n\r\nThe people rose, pillaged the houses of those who had summoned the\r\nforeigner, and declared that it would not separate its lot from that of\r\nthe republic.  So Treviso remained Venetian.  Two other small towns,\r\nMarano and Osopo, followed her example; and for several months this was\r\nall that the Venetians preserved of their continental possessions.  But\r\nat the commencement of July, 1509, they heard that the important town of\r\nPadua, which had fallen to the share of Emperor Maximilian, was uttering\r\npassionate murmurs against its new master, and wished for nothing better\r\nthan to come back beneath the old sway; and, in spite of the opposition\r\nshown by the doge, Loredano, the Venetians resolved to attempt the\r\nventure.  During the night between the 16th and 17th of July, a small\r\ndetachment, well armed and well led, arrived beneath the walls of Padua,\r\nwhich was rather carelessly guarded.  In the morning, as soon as the gate\r\nwas opened, a string of large wagons presented themselves for admittance.\r\nBehind one of these, and partially concealed by its bulk, advanced six\r\nVenetian men-at-arms, each carrying on his crupper a foot-soldier armed\r\nwith an arquebuse; they fired on the guard; each killed his man; the\r\nAustrian garrison hurried up and fought bravely; but other Venetian\r\ntroops arrived, and the garrison was beaten and surrendered.  Padua\r\nbecame Venetian again.  “This surprisal,” says M. Darn, “caused\r\ninexpressible joy in Venice; after so many disasters there was seen a\r\ngleans of hope.”  The Venetians hastened to provision Padua well and to\r\nput it in a state of defence; and they at the same time published a\r\ndecree promising such subjects of the republic as should come back to its\r\nsway complete indemnity for the losses they might have suffered during\r\nthe war.  It blazed forth again immediately, but at first between the\r\nVenetians and the Emperor Maximilian almost alone by himself.  Louis\r\nXII., in a hurry to get back to France, contented himself with leaving in\r\nLombardy a body of troops under the orders of James de Chabannes, Sire de\r\nla Palisse, with orders “to take five hundred of the lustiest men-at-arms\r\nand go into the service of the emperor, who was to make a descent upon\r\nthe district of Padua.”  Maximilian did not make his descent until two\r\nmonths after that the Venetians had retaken Padua and provisioned it\r\nwell; and it was only on the 15th of September that he sat down before\r\nthe place.  All the allies of the League of Cambrai held themselves bound\r\nto furnish him with their contingent.  On sallying from Milan for this\r\ncampaign, La Palisse “fell in with the good knight Bayard, to whom he\r\nsaid, ‘My comrade, my friend, would you not like us to be comrades\r\ntogether?’  Bayard, who asked nothing better, answered him graciously\r\nthat he was at his service to be disposed of at his pleasure;” and from\r\nthe 15th to the 20th of September, Maximilian got together before Padua\r\nan army with a strength, it is said, of about fifty thousand men,\r\nmen-at-arms or infantry, Germans, Spaniards, French, and Italians, sent\r\nby the pope and by the Duke of Ferrara, or recruited from all parts of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAt the first rumor of such a force there was great emotion in Venice, but\r\nan emotion tempered by bravery and intelligence.  The doge, Leonardo\r\nLoredano, the same who had but lately opposed the surprisal of Padua,\r\nrose up and delivered in the senate a long speech, of which only the\r\nessential and characteristic points can be quoted here:--\r\n\r\n“Everybody knows, excellent gentlemen of the senate,” said he, “that on\r\nthe preservation of Padua depends all hope, not only of recovering our\r\nempire, but of maintaining our own liberty.  It must be confessed that,\r\ngreat and wonderful as they have been, the preparations made and the\r\nsupplies provided hitherto are not sufficient either for the security of\r\nthat town or for the dignity of our republic.  Our ancient renown forbids\r\nus to leave the public safety, the lives and honor of our wives and our\r\nchildren, entirely to the tillers of our fields and to mercenary\r\nsoldiers, without rushing ourselves to shelter them behind our own\r\nbreasts and defend them with our own arms.  For so great and so glorious\r\na fatherland, which has for so many years been the bulwark of the faith\r\nand the glory of the Christian republic, will the personal service of its\r\ncitizens and its sons be ever to seek?  To save it who would refuse to\r\nrisk his own life and that of his children?  If the defence of Padua is\r\nthe pledge for the salvation of Venice, who would hesitate to go and\r\ndefend it?  And, though the forces already there were sufficient, is not\r\nour honor also concerned therein?  The fortune of our city so willed it\r\nthat in the space of a few days our empire slipped from our hands; the\r\nopportunity has come back to us of recovering what we have lost; by\r\nspontaneously facing the changes and chances of fate, we shall prove that\r\nour disasters have not been our fault or our shame, but one of those\r\nfatal storms which no wisdom and no firmness of man can resist.  If it\r\nwere permitted us all in one mass to set out for Padua, if we might,\r\nwithout neglecting the defence of our own homes and our urgent public\r\naffairs, leave our city for some days deserted, I would not await your\r\ndeliberation; I would be the first on the road to Padua; for how could I\r\nbetter expend the last days of my old age than in going to be present at\r\nand take part in such a victory?  But Venice may not be deserted by her\r\npublic bodies, which protect and defend Padua by their forethought and\r\ntheir orders just as others do by their arms; and a useless mob of\r\ngraybeards would be a burden much more than a reenforcement there.  Nor\r\ndo I ask that Venice be drained of all her youth; but I advise, I exhort,\r\nthat we choose two hundred young gentlemen, from the chiefest of our\r\nfamilies, and that they all, with such friends and following as their\r\nmeans will permit them to get together, go forth to Padua to do all that\r\nshall be necessary for her defence.  My two sons, with many a comrade.\r\nwill be the first to carry out what I, their father and your chief, am\r\nthe first to propose.  Thus Padua will be placed in security; and when\r\nthe mercenary soldiers who are there see how prompt are our youth to\r\nguard the gates and everywhere face the battle, they will be moved\r\nthereby to zeal and alacrity incalculable; and not only will Padua thus\r\nbe defended and saved, but all nations will see that we, we too, as our\r\nfathers were, are men enough to defend at the peril of our lives the\r\nfreedom and th  safety of the noblest country in the world.”\r\n\r\nThis generous advice was accepted by the fathers and carried out by the\r\nsons with that earnest, prompt, and effective ardor which accompanies the\r\nresolution of great souls.  When the Paduans, before their city was as\r\nyet invested, saw the arrival within their walls of these chosen youths\r\nof the Venetian patriciate, with their numerous troop of friends and\r\nfollowers, they considered Padua as good as saved; and when the imperial\r\narmy, posted before the place, commenced their attacks upon it, they soon\r\nperceived that they had formidable defenders to deal with.  “Five hundred\r\nyears it was since in prince’s camp had ever been seen such wealth as\r\nthere was there; and never was a day but there filed off some three or\r\nfour hundred lanzknechts who took away to Germany oxen and kine, beds,\r\ncorn, silk for sewing, and other articles; in such sort that to the said\r\ncountry of Padua was damage done to the amount of two millions of crowns\r\nin movables and in houses and palaces burnt and destroyed.”  For three\r\ndays the imperial artillery fired upon the town and made in its walls\r\nthree breaches “knocked into one;” and still the defenders kept up their\r\nresistance with the same vigor.  “One morning,” says the Loyal Serviteur\r\nof Bayard, “the Emperor Maximilian, accompanied by his princes and lords\r\nfrom Germany, went thither to look; and he marvelled and thought it great\r\nshame to him, with the number of men he had, that he had not sooner\r\ndelivered the assault.  On returning to his quarters he sent for a French\r\nsecretary of his, whom he bade write to the lord of La Palisse a letter,\r\nwhereof this was the substance: ‘Dear cousin, I have this morning been to\r\nlook at the breach, which I find more than practicable for whoever would\r\ndo his duty.  I have made up my mind to deliver the assault to-day.  I\r\npray you, so soon as my big drum sounds, which will be about midday, that\r\nyou do incontinently hold ready all the French gentlemen who are under\r\nyour orders at my service, by command of my brother the King of France,\r\nto go to the said assault along with my foot; and I hope that, with God’s\r\nhelp we shall carry it.’\r\n\r\n“The lord of La Palisse,” continues the chronicler, “thought this a\r\nsomewhat strange manner of proceeding; howbeit he hid his thought, and\r\nsaid to the secretary, ‘I am astounded that the emperor did not send for\r\nmy comrades and me for to deliberate more fully of this matter; howbeit\r\nyou will tell him that I will send to fetch them, and when they are come\r\nI will show them the letter.  I do not think there will be many who will\r\nnot be obedient to that which the emperor shall be pleased to command.’\r\n\r\n“When the French captains had arrived at the quarters of the lord of La\r\nPalisse, he said to them, ‘Gentlemen, we must now dine, for I have\r\nsomewhat to say to you, and if I were to say it first, peradventure you\r\nwould not make good cheer.’  During dinner they did nothing but make\r\nsport one of another.  After dinner, everybody was sent out of the room,\r\nsave the captains, to whom the lord of La Palisse made known the\r\nemperor’s letter, which was read twice, for the better understanding of\r\nit.  They all looked at one another, laughing, for to see who would speak\r\nfirst.  Then said the lord of Ymbercourt to the lord of La Palisse, ‘It\r\nneeds not so much thought, my lord; send word to the emperor that we are\r\nall ready; I am even now a-weary of the fields, for the nights are cold;\r\nand then the good wines are beginning to fail us;’ whereat every one\r\nburst out a-laughing.  All agreed to what was said by the lord of\r\nYmbercourt.  The lord of La Palisse looked at the good knight (Bayard),\r\nand saw that he seemed to be picking his teeth, as if he had not heard\r\nwhat his comrades had proposed.  ‘Well, and you,’ said he, ‘what say you\r\nabout it?  It is no time for picking one’s teeth; we must at once send\r\nspeedy reply to the emperor.’  Gayly the good knight answered, ‘If we\r\nwould all take my lord of Ymbercourt’s word, we have only to go straight\r\nto the breach.  But it is a somewhat sorry pastime for men-at-arms to go\r\nafoot, and I would gladly be excused.  Howbeit, since I must give my\r\nopinion, I will.  The emperor bids you, in his letter, set all the French\r\ngentlemen afoot for to deliver the assault along with his lanzknechts.\r\nMy opinion is, that you, my lord, ought to send back to the emperor a\r\nreply of this sort: that you have had a meeting of your captains, who are\r\nquite determined to do his bidding, according to the charge they have\r\nfrom the king their master; but that to mix them up with the foot, who\r\nare of small estate, would be to make them of little account; the emperor\r\nhas loads of counts, lords, and gentlemen of Germany; let him set them\r\nafoot along with the men-at-arms of France, who will gladly show them the\r\nroad; and then his lanzknechts will follow, if they know that it will\r\npay.’  When the good knight had thus spoken, his advice was found\r\nvirtuous and reasonable.  To the emperor was sent back this answer, which\r\nhe thought right honorable.  He incontinently had his trumpets sounded\r\nand his drums beaten for to assemble all the princes, and lords, and\r\ncaptains as well of Germany and Burgundy as of Hainault.  Then the\r\nemperor declared to them that he was determined to go, within an hour,\r\nand deliver the assault on the town, whereof he had notified the lords of\r\nFrance, who were all most desirous of doing their duty therein right\r\nwell, and prayed him that along with them might go the gentlemen of\r\nGermany, to whom they would gladly show the road: ‘Wherefore, my lords,’\r\nsaid the emperor, I pray you, as much as ever I can, to be pleased to\r\naccompany them and set yourselves afoot with them; and I hope, with God’s\r\nhelp, that at the first assault we shall be masters of our enemies.’\r\nWhen the emperor had done speaking, on a sudden there arose among his\r\nGermans a very wondrous and strange uproar, which lasted half an hour\r\nbefore it was appeased; and then one amongst them, bidden to answer for\r\nall, said that they were not folks to be set afoot or so to go up to a\r\nbreach, and that their condition was to fight like gentlemen,\r\na-horseback.  Other answer the emperor could not get; but though it was\r\nnot according to his desire, and pleased him not at all, he uttered no\r\nword beyond that he said, ‘Good my lords, we must advise, then, how we\r\nshall do for the best.’  Then, forthwith he sent for a gentleman of his\r\nwho from time to time went backwards and forwards as ambassador to the\r\nFrench, and said to him, ‘Go to the quarters of my cousin, the lord of La\r\nPalisse; commend me to him and to all my lords the French captains you\r\nfind with him, and tell them that for to-day the assault will not be\r\ndelivered.’ I know not,” says the chronicler, “how it was nor who gave\r\nthe advice; but the night after this speech was spoken the emperor went\r\noff, all in one stretch, more than forty miles from the camp, and from\r\nhis new quarters sent word to his people to have the siege raised; which\r\nwas done.”\r\n\r\nSo Padua was saved, and Venice once more became a power.  Louis XII.,\r\nhaving returned victorious to France, did not trouble himself much about\r\nthe check received in Italy by Emperor Maximilian, for whom he had no\r\nlove and but little esteem.  Maximilian was personally brave and free\r\nfrom depravity or premeditated perfidy, but he was coarse, volatile,\r\ninconsistent, and not very able.  Louis XII. had amongst his allies of\r\nCambrai and in Italy a more serious and more skilful foe, who was\r\npreparing for him much greater embarrassments.\r\n\r\nJulian Bella Rovera had, before his elevation to the pontifical throne,\r\nbut one object, which was, to mount it.  When he became pope, he had\r\nthree objects: to recover and extend the temporal possessions of the\r\npapacy, to exercise to the full his spiritual power, and to drive the\r\nforeigner from Italy.  He was not incapable of doubling and artifice.\r\nIn order to rise he had flattered Louis XII. and Cardinal d’Amboise with\r\nthe hope that the king’s minister would become the head of Christendom.\r\nWhen once he was himself in possession of this puissant title he showed\r\nhimself as he really was; ambitious, audacious, imperious, energetic,\r\nstubborn, and combining the egotism of the absolute sovereign with the\r\npatriotism of an Italian pope.  When the League of Cambrai had attained\r\nsuccess through the victory of Louis XII. over the Venetians, Cardinal\r\nd’Amboise, in course of conversation with the two envoys from Florence at\r\nthe king’s court, let them have an inkling “that he was not without\r\nsuspicion of some new design;” and when Louis XII. announced his\r\napproaching departure for France, the two Florentines wrote to their\r\ngovernment that “this departure might have very evil results, for the\r\npower of Emperor Maximilian in Italy, the position of Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, the despair of the Venetians, and the character and\r\ndissatisfaction of the pope, seemed to foreshadow some fresh\r\nunderstanding against the Most Christian king.”  Louis XII. and his\r\nminister were very confident.  “Take Spain, the king of the Romans, or\r\nwhom you please,” said Cardinal d’Amboise to the two Florentines; “there\r\nis none who has observed and kept the alliance more faithfully than the\r\nking has; he has done everything at the moment he promised; he has borne\r\nupon his shoulders the whole weight of this affair; and I tell you,” he\r\nadded, with a fixed look at those whom he was addressing, “that his army\r\nis a large one, which he will keep up and augment every day.”  Louis, for\r\nhis part, treated the Florentines with great good-will, as friends on\r\nwhom he counted and who were concerned in his success.  “You have become\r\nthe first power in Italy,” he said to then one day before a crowd of\r\npeople: “how are you addressed just now?  Are you Most Serene or Most\r\nIllustrious?”  And when he was notified that distinguished Venetians were\r\ngoing to meet Emperor Maximilian on his arrival in Italy, “No matter,”\r\n said Louis; “let them go whither they will.”  The Florentines did not the\r\nless nourish their mistrustful presentiments; and one of Louis XII.’s\r\nmost intelligent advisers, his finance-minister Florimond Robertet, was\r\nnot slow to share them.  “The pope,” said he to them one day [July 1,\r\n1509], “is behaving very ill towards us; he seeks on every occasion to\r\nsow enmity between the princes, especially between the emperor and the\r\nMost Christian king;” and, some weeks later, whilst speaking of the\r\nmoney-aids which the new King of England was sending, it was said, to\r\nEmperor Maximilian, he said to the Florentine, Nasi, “It would be a very\r\nserious business, if from all this were to result against us a universal\r\nleague, in which the pope, England, and Spain should join.”\r\n [_Negotiations Diplomatiques de la France avec la Toscane,_ published by\r\nM. Abel Desjardins, in the _Documents relatifs d l’Histoire de France,_\r\nt.  ii.  pp.  331, 355, 367, 384, 389, 416.]\r\n\r\nNext year (1510) the mistrust of the Florentine envoys was justified.\r\nThe Venetians sent a humble address to the pope, ceded to him the places\r\nthey but lately possessed in the Romagna, and conjured him to relieve\r\nthem from the excommunication he had pronounced against them.  Julius\r\nII., after some little waiting, accorded the favor demanded of him.\r\nLouis XII. committed the mistake of embroiling himself with the Swiss by\r\nrefusing to add twenty thousand livres to the pay of sixty thousand he\r\nwas giving them already, and by styling them “wretched mountain-\r\nshepherds, who presumed to impose upon him a tax he was not disposed to\r\nsubmit to.”  The pope conferred the investiture of the kingdom of Naples\r\nupon Ferdinand the Catholic, who at first promised only his neutrality,\r\nbut could not fail to be drawn in still farther when war was rekindled in\r\nItaly.  In all these negotiations with the Venetians, the Swiss, the\r\nKings of Spain and England, and the Emperor Maximilian, Julius II. took a\r\nbold initiative.  Maximilian alone remained for some time at peace with\r\nthe King of France.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1511, a league was formally concluded between the pope, the\r\nVenetians, the Swiss, and King Ferdinand against Louis XII.  A place was\r\nreserved in it for the King of England, Henry VIII., who, on ascending\r\nthe throne, had sent word to the King of France that “he desired to abide\r\nin the same friendship that the king his father had kept up,” but who, at\r\nthe bottom of his heart, burned to resume on the Continent an active and\r\na prominent part.  The coalition thus formed was called the League of\r\nHoly Union.  “I,” said Louis XII., “am the Saracen against whom this\r\nleague is directed.”\r\n\r\nHe had just lost, a few months previously, the intimate and faithful\r\nadviser and friend of his whole life: Cardinal George d’Amboise, seized\r\nat Milan with a fit of the gout, during which Louis tended him with the\r\nassiduity and care of an affectionate brother, died at Lyons on the 25th\r\nof May, 1510, at fifty years of age.  He was one not of the greatest, but\r\nof the most honest ministers who ever enjoyed a powerful monarch’s\r\nconstant favor, and employed it we will not say with complete\r\ndisinterestedness, but with a predominant anxiety for the public weal.\r\nIn the matter of external policy the influence of Cardinal d’Amboise, was\r\nneither skilfully nor salutarily exercised: he, like his master, indulged\r\nin those views of distant, incoherent, and improvident conquests which\r\ncaused the reign of Louis XII. to be wasted in ceaseless wars, with which\r\nthe cardinal’s desire of becoming pope was not altogether unconnected,\r\nand which, after having resulted in nothing but reverses, were a heavy\r\nheritage for the succeeding reign.  But at home, in his relations with\r\nhis king and in his civil and religious administration, Cardinal\r\nd’Amboise was an earnest and effective friend of justice, of sound social\r\norder, and of regard for morality in the practice of power.  It is said\r\nthat, in his latter days, he, virtuously weary of the dignities of this\r\nworld, said to the infirmary-brother who was attending him, “Ah! Brother\r\nJohn, why did I not always remain Brother John!”  A pious regret the\r\nsincerity and modesty whereof are rare amongst men of high estate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cardinal d’Amboise----347]\r\n\r\n“At last, then, I am the only pope!” cried Julius II., when he heard that\r\nCardinal d’Amboise was dead.  But his joy was misplaced: the cardinal’s\r\ndeath was a great loss to him; between the king and the pope the cardinal\r\nhad been an intelligent mediator, who understood the two positions and\r\nthe two characters, and who, though most faithful and devoted to the\r\nking, had nevertheless a place in his heart for the papacy also, and\r\nlabored earnestly on every occasion to bring about between the two rivals\r\na policy of moderation and peace.  “One thing you may be certain of,”\r\n said Louis’s finance-minister Robertet to the ambassador from Florence,\r\n“that the king’s character is not an easy one to deal with; he is not\r\nreadily brought round to what is not his own opinion, which is not always\r\na correct one; he is irritated against the pope; and the cardinal, to\r\nwhom that causes great displeasure, does not always succeed, in spite of\r\nall influence, in getting him to do as he would like.  If our Lord God\r\nwere to remove the cardinal, either by death or in any other manner, from\r\npublic life, there would arise in this court and in the fashion of\r\nconducting affairs such confusion that nothing equal to it would ever\r\nhave been seen in our day.”  [_Negociations Diplomatiques de la France\r\navec la Toscane,_ t.  ii.  pp.  428 and 460.]  And the confusion did, in\r\nfact, arise; and war was rekindled, or, to speak more correctly, resumed\r\nits course after the cardinal’s death.  Julius II.  plunged into it in\r\nperson, moving to every point where it was going on, living in the midst\r\nof camps, himself in military costume, besieging towns, having his guns\r\npointed and assaults delivered under his own eyes.  Men expressed\r\nastonishment, not unmixed with admiration, at the indomitable energy of\r\nthis soldier-pope at seventy years of age.  It was said that he had cast\r\ninto the Tiber the keys of St. Peter to gird on the sword of St. Paul.\r\nHis answer to everything was, “The barbarians must be driven from Italy.”\r\n Louis XII. became more and more irritated and undecided.  “To reassure\r\nhis people,” says Bossuet (to which we may add, ‘and to reassure\r\nhimself’), “he assembled at Tours (in September, 1510), the prelates of\r\nhis kingdom, to consult them as to what he could do at so disagreeable a\r\ncrisis without wounding his conscience.  Thereupon it was said that the\r\npope, being unjustly the aggressor, and having even violated an agreement\r\nmade with the king, ought to be treated as an enemy, and that the king\r\nmight not only defend himself, but might even attack him without fear of\r\nexcommunication.  Not considering this quite strong enough yet, Louis\r\nresolved to assemble a council against the pope.  The general council was\r\nthe desire of the whole church since the election of Martin V. at the\r\ncouncil of Constance (November 11, 1417); for, though that council had\r\ndone great good by putting an end to the schism which had lasted for\r\nforty years, it had not accomplished what it had projected, which was a\r\nreformation of the Church in its head and in its members; but, for the\r\ndoing of so holy a work, it had ordained, on separating, that there\r\nshould be held a fresh council.  .  .  .  This one was opened at Pisa\r\n(November 1, 1511) with but little solemnity by the proxies of the\r\ncardinals who had caused its convocation.  The pope had deposed them, and\r\nhad placed under interdict the town of Pisa, where the council was to be\r\nheld, and even Florence, because the Florentines had granted Pisa for the\r\nassemblage.  Thereupon the religious brotherhoods were unwilling to put\r\nin an appearance at the opening of the council, and the priests of the\r\nChurch refused the necessary paraphernalia.  The people rose, and the\r\ncardinals, having arrived, did not consider their position safe; insomuch\r\nthat after the first session they removed the council to Milan, where\r\nthey met with no better reception.  Gaston de Foix, nephew of Louis XII.,\r\nwho had just appointed him governor of Milaness, could certainly force\r\nthe clergy to proceed and the people to be quiet, but he could not force\r\nthem to have for the council the respect due to so great a name; there\r\nwere not seen at it, according to usage, the legates of the Holy See;\r\nthere were scarcely fifteen or sixteen French prelates there; the Emperor\r\nMaximilian had either not influence enough or no inclination to send to\r\nit a single one from Germany; and, in a word, there was not to be seen in\r\nthis assembly anything that savored of the majesty of a general council,\r\nand it was understood to be held for political purposes.”  [Bossuet,\r\n_Abrege de l’Histoire de France pour l’Education du dauphin_; _OEuvres\r\ncompletes_ (1828), t.  xvii.  pp.  541, 545.] Bossuet had good grounds\r\nfor speaking so.  Louis XII. himself said, in 1511, to the ambassador of\r\nSpain, that “this pretended council was only a scarecrow which he had no\r\nidea of employing save for the purpose of bringing the pope to reason.”\r\n Amidst these vain attempts at ecclesiastical influence the war was\r\ncontinued with passionateness on the part of Julius II., with hesitation\r\non the part of Louis XII., and with some disquietude on the part of the\r\nFrench commanders, although with their wonted bravery and loyalty.\r\nChaumont d’Amboise, the cardinal’s nephew, held the command-in-chief in\r\nthe king’s army.  He fell ill: the pope had excommunicated him; and\r\nChaumont sent to beg him, with instance, to give him absolution, which\r\ndid not arrive until he was on his death-bed.  “This is the worst,” says\r\nBossuet, “of wars against the Church; they cause scruples not only in\r\nweak minds, but even, at certain moments, in the very strongest.”\r\n Alphonso d’ Este, Duke of Ferrara, was almost the only great Italian lord\r\nwho remained faithful to France.  Julius II., who was besieging Ferrara,\r\ntried to win over the duke, who rejected all his offers, and, instead,\r\nwon over the negotiator, who offered his services to poison the pope.\r\nBayard, when informed of this proposal, indignantly declared that he\r\nwould go and have the traitor hanged, and warning sent to the pope.\r\n“Why,” said the duke, “he would have been very glad to do as much for you\r\nand me.”  “That is no odds to me,” said the knight; “he is God’s\r\nlieutenant on earth, and, as for having him put to death in such sort, I\r\nwill never consent to it.”  The duke shrugged his shoulders, and spitting\r\non the ground, said,  ‘Od’s body, Sir Bayard, I would like to get rid of\r\nall my enemies in that way; but, since you do not think it well, the\r\nmatter shall stand over; whereof, unless God apply a remedy, both you and\r\nI will repent us.”  Assuredly Bayard did not repent of his honest\r\nindignation; but, finding about the same time (January, 1511) an\r\nopportunity of surprising and carrying off the pope, he did not care to\r\nmiss it; he placed himself in ambush before day-break, with a hundred\r\npicked men-at-arms, close to a village from which the pope was to issue.\r\n“The pope, who was pretty early, mounted his litter, so soon as he saw\r\nthe dawn, and the clerics and officers of all kinds went before without a\r\nthought of anything.  When the good knight heard them he sallied forth\r\nfrom his ambush, and went charging down upon the rustics, who, sore\r\ndismayed, turned back again, pricking along with loosened rein and\r\nshouting, Alarm! alarm!  But all that would have been of no use but for\r\nan accident very lucky for the holy father, and very unfortunate for the\r\ngood knight.  When the pope had mounted his litter, he was not a stone’s\r\nthrow gone when there fell from heaven the most sharp and violent shower\r\nthat had been seen for a hundred years.  ‘Holy father,’ said the Cardinal\r\nof Pavia to the pope, ‘it is not possible to go along this country so\r\nlong as this lasts; meseems you must turn back again; ‘to which the pope\r\nagreed; but, just as he was arriving at St. Felix, and was barely\r\nentering within the castle, he heard the shouts of the fugitives whom the\r\ngood knight was pursuing as hard as he could spur; whereupon he had such\r\na fright, that, suddenly and without help, he leaped out of his litter,\r\nand himself did aid in hauling up the bridge; which was doing like a man\r\nof wits, for had he waited until one could say a _Pater noster,_ he had\r\nbeen snapped up.  Who was right down grieved, that was the good knight;\r\nnever man turned back so melancholic as he was to have missed so fair a\r\ntake; and the pope, from the good fright he had gotten, shook like a\r\npalsy the live-long day.”  [_Histoire du ben Chevalier Ballard,_ t.  i.\r\npp.  346-349.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chaumont d’Amboise----350]\r\n\r\nFrom 1510 to 1512 the war in Italy was thus proceeding, but with no great\r\nresults, when Gaston de Foix, Duke of Nemours, came to take the command\r\nof the French army.  He was scarcely twenty-three, and had hitherto only\r\nserved under Trivulzio and La Palisse; but he had already a character for\r\nbravery and intelligence in war.  Louis XII. loved this son of his\r\nsister, Mary of Orleans, and gladly elevated him to the highest rank.\r\nGaston, from the very first, justified this favor.  Instead of seeking\r\nfor glory in the field only, he began by shutting himself up in Milan,\r\nwhich the Swiss were besieging.  They made him an offer to take the road\r\nback to Switzerland, if he would give them a month’s pay; the sum was\r\ndiscussed; Gaston considered that they asked too much for their\r\nwithdrawal; the Swiss broke off the negotiation; but “to the great\r\nastonishment of everybody,” says Guicciardini, “they raised the siege and\r\nreturned to their own country.”  The pope was besieging Bologna; Gaston\r\narrived there suddenly with a body of troops whom he had marched out at\r\nnight through a tempest of wind and snow; and he was safe inside the\r\nplace whilst the besiegers were still ignorant of his movement.  The\r\nsiege of Bologna was raised.  Gaston left it immediately to march on\r\nBrescia, which the Venetians had taken possession of for the Holy League.\r\nHe retook the town by a vigorous assault, gave it up to pillage, punished\r\nwith death Count Louis Avogaro and his two sons, who had excited the\r\ninhabitants against France, and gave a beating to the Venetian army\r\nbefore its walls.  All these successes had been gained in a fortnight.\r\n“According to universal opinion,” says Guicciardini, “Italy for several\r\ncenturies had seen nothing like these military operations.”\r\n\r\nWe are not proof against the pleasure of giving a place in this history\r\nto a deed of virtue and chivalrous kindness on Bayard’s part, the story\r\nof which has been told and retold many times in various works.  It is\r\nhonorable to human kind, and especially to the middle ages, that such men\r\nand such deeds are met with here and there, amidst the violence of war\r\nand the general barbarity of manners.\r\n\r\nBayard had been grievously wounded at the assault of Brescia; so\r\ngrievously that he said to his neighbor, the lord of Molart, “‘Comrade,\r\nmarch your men forward; the town is ours; as for me, I cannot pull on\r\nfarther, for I am a dead man.’  When the town was taken, two of his\r\narchers bare him to a house, the most conspicuous they saw thereabouts.\r\nIt was the abode of a very rich gentleman; but he had fled away to a\r\nmonastery, and his wife had remained at the abode under the care of Our\r\nLord, together with two fair daughters she had, the which were hidden in\r\na granary beneath some hay.  When there came a knocking at her door, she\r\nsaw the good knight who was being brought in thus wounded, the which had\r\nthe door shut incontinently, and set at the entrance the two archers, to\r\nthe which he said, ‘Take heed for your lives, that none enter herein\r\nunless it be any of my own folk; I am certified that, when it is known to\r\nbe my quarters, none will try to force a way in; and if, by your aiding\r\nme, I be the cause that ye lose a chance of gaining somewhat, never ye\r\nmind; ye shall lose nought thereby.’\r\n\r\n“The archers did as they were bid, and he was borne into a mighty fine\r\nchamber, into the which the lady of the house herself conducted him; and,\r\nthrowing herself upon her knees before him, she spoke after this fashion,\r\nbeing interpreted, ‘Noble sir, I present unto you this house, and all\r\nthat is therein, for well I know it is yours by right of war; but may it\r\nbe your pleasure to spare me my honor and life, and those of two young\r\ndaughters that I and my husband have, who are ready for marriage.’ The\r\ngood knight, who never thought wickedness, replied to her, ‘Madam, I know\r\nnot whether I can escape from the wound that I have; but, so long as I\r\nlive, you and your daughters shall be done no displeasure, any more than\r\nto my own person.  Only keep them in your chambers; let them not be seen;\r\nand I assure you that there is no man in the house who would take upon\r\nhimself to enter any place against your will.’\r\n\r\n“When the good lady heard him so virtuously speak, she was all assured.\r\nAfterwards, he prayed her to give instructions to some good surgeon, who\r\nmight quickly come to tend him; which she did, and herself went in quest\r\nof him with one of the archers.  He, having arrived, did probe the good\r\nknight’s wound, which was great and deep; howbeit he certified him that\r\nthere was no danger of death.  At the second dressing came to see him the\r\nDuke of Nemours’ surgeon, called Master Claude, the which did\r\nthenceforward have the healing of him; and right well he did his devoir,\r\nin such sort that in less than a month he was ready to mount a-horseback.\r\nThe good knight, when he was dressed, asked his hostess where her husband\r\nwas; and the good lady, all in tears, said to him, ‘By my faith, my lord,\r\nI know not whether he be dead or alive; but I have a shrewd idea that, if\r\nhe be living, he will be in a large monastery, where be hath large\r\nacquaintance.’  ‘Lady,’ said the good knight, ‘have him fetched; and I\r\nwill send in quest of him in such sort that he shall have no harm.’  She\r\nset herself to inquire where he was, and found him; then were sent in\r\nquest of him the good knight’s steward and two archers, who brought him\r\naway in safety; and on his arrival he had joyous cheer (reception) from\r\nhis guest, the good knight, the which did tell him not to be melancholic,\r\nand that there was quartered upon him none but friends.  .  .  .  For\r\nabout a month or five weeks was the good knight ill of his wound, without\r\nleaving his couch.  One day he was minded to get up, and he walked across\r\nhis chamber, not being sure whether he could keep his legs; somewhat weak\r\nhe found himself; but the great heart he had gave him not leisure to\r\nthink long thereon.  He sent to fetch the surgeon who had the healing of\r\nhim, and said to him, ‘My friend, tell me, I pray you, if there be any\r\ndanger in setting me on the march; me-seems that I am well, or all but\r\nso; and I give you my faith that, in my judgment, the biding will\r\nhenceforth harm me more than mend me, for I do marvellously fret.’  The\r\ngood knight’s servitors had already told the surgeon the great desire he\r\nhad to be at the battle, for every day he had news from the camp of the\r\nFrench, how that they were getting nigh the Spaniards, and there were\r\nhopes from day to day of the battle, which would, to his great sorrow,\r\nhave been delivered without him.  Having knowledge whereof, and also\r\nknowing his complexion, the surgeon said, in his own language, ‘My lord,\r\nyour wound is not yet closed up; howbeit, inside it is quite healed.\r\nYour barber shall see to dressing you this once more; and provided that\r\nevery day, morning and evening, he put on a little piece of lint and a\r\nplaister for which I will deliver to him the ointment, it will not\r\nincrease your hurt; and there is no danger, for the worst of the wound is\r\na-top, and will not touch the saddle of your horse.’  Whoso had given him\r\nten thousand crowns, the good knight had not been so glad.  He determined\r\nto set out in two days, commanding his people to put in order all his\r\ngear.\r\n\r\n“The lady with whom he lodged, who held herself all the while his\r\nprisoner, together with her husband and her children, had many\r\nimaginings.  Thinking to herself that, if her guest were minded to treat\r\nwith rigor herself and her husband, he might get out of them ten or\r\ntwelve thousand crowns, for they had two thousand a year, she made up her\r\nmind to make him some worthy present; and she had found him so good a\r\nman, and of so gentle a heart, that, to her thinking, he would be\r\ngraciously content.  On the morning of the day whereon the good knight\r\nwas to dislodge after dinner, his hostess, with one of her servitors\r\ncarrying a little box made of steel, entered his chamber, where she found\r\nthat he was resting in a chair, after having walked about a great deal,\r\nso as continually, little by little, to try his leg.  She threw herself\r\nupon both knees; but incontinently he raised her up, and would never\r\nsuffer her to speak a word, until she was first seated beside him.  She\r\nbegan her speech in this manner: ‘My lord, the grace which God did me, at\r\nthe taking of this town, in directing you to this our house, was not less\r\nthan the saving to me of my husband’s life, and my own, and my two\r\ndaughters’, together with their honor, which they ought to hold dearer\r\nstill.  And more, from the time that you arrived here, there hath not\r\nbeen done to me, or to the least of my people, a single insult, but all\r\ncourtesy; and there hath not been taken by your folks of the goods they\r\nfound here the value of a farthing without paying for it.  My lord, I am\r\nwell aware that my husband, and I, and my children, and all of this\r\nhousehold are your prisoners, for to do with and dispose of at your good\r\npleasure, as well as the goods that are herein; but, knowing the\r\nnobleness of your heart, I am come for to entreat you right humbly that\r\nit may please you to have pity upon us, extending your wonted generosity.\r\nHere is a little present we make you; you will be pleased to take it in\r\ngood part.’  Then she took the box which the servitor was holding, and\r\nopened it before the good knight, who saw it full of beautiful ducats.\r\nThe gentle lord, who never in his life made any case of money, burst out\r\nlaughing, and said, ‘Madam, how many ducats are there in this box?’  The\r\npoor soul was afraid that he was angry at seeing so few, and said to him,\r\n‘My lord, there are but two thousand five hundred ducats; but, if you are\r\nnot content, we will find a larger sum.’  Then said he, ‘By my faith,\r\nmadam, though you should give me a hundred thousand crowns, you would not\r\ndo so well towards me as you have done by the good cheer I have had here,\r\nand the kind tendance you have given me; in whatsoever place I may happen\r\nto be, you will have, so long as God shall grant me life, a gentleman at\r\nyour bidding.  As for your ducats, I will none of them; and yet I thank\r\nyou; take them back; all my life I have always loved people much better\r\nthan crowns.  And think not in any wise that I do not go away as well\r\npleased with you as if this town were at your disposal, and you had given\r\nit to me.’\r\n\r\n“The good lady was much astounded at finding herself put off.  ‘My lord,’\r\nsaid she, ‘I should feel myself forever the most wretched creature in the\r\nworld, if you did not take away with you so small a present as I make\r\nyou, which is nothing in comparison with the courtesy you have shown me\r\nheretofore, and still show me now by your great kindness.’  When the\r\nknight saw her so firm, he said to her, ‘Well, then, madam, I will take\r\nit for love of you; but go and fetch me your two daughters, for I would\r\nfain bid them farewell.’  The poor soul, who thought herself in paradise,\r\nnow that her present was at last accepted, went to fetch her daughters,\r\nthe which were very fair, good, and well educated, and had afforded the\r\ngood knight much pastime during his illness, for right well could they\r\nsing and play on the lute and spinet, and right well work with the\r\nneedle.  They were brought before the good knight, who, whilst they were\r\nattiring themselves, had caused the ducats to be placed in three lots,\r\ntwo of a thousand each, and the other of five hundred.  They, having\r\narrived, would have fallen on their knees, but were incontinently raised\r\nup, and the elder of the two began to say, ‘My lord, these two poor\r\ngirls, to whom you have done so much honor as to guard them, are come to\r\ntake leave of you, humbly thanking your lordship for the favor they have\r\nreceived, for which, having nothing else in their power, they will be\r\nfor-ever bound to pray God for you.’  The good knight, half-weeping to\r\nsee so much sweetness and humility in those two fair girls, made answer,\r\n‘Dear demoisels, you have done what I ought to do; that is, thank you for\r\nthe good company you have made me, and for which I feel myself much\r\nbeholden and bounden.  You know that fighting men are not likely to be\r\nladen with pretty things for to present to ladies; and for my part, I am\r\nsore displeased that I am in no wise well provided for making you such\r\npresent as I am bound to make.  Here is your lady-mother, who has given\r\nme two thousand five hundred ducats, which you see on this table; of them\r\nI give to each of you a thousand towards your marriage; and for my\r\nrecompense, you shall, an if it please you, pray God for me.’  He put the\r\nducats into their aprons, whether they would or not; and then, turning to\r\nhis hostess, he said to her, “Madam, I will take these five hundred\r\nducats for mine own profit, to distribute them amongst the poor\r\nsisterhoods which have been plundered; and to you I commit the charge of\r\nthem, for you, better than any other, will understand where there is need\r\nthereof, and thereupon I take my leave of you.”  Then he touched them all\r\nupon the hand, after the Italian manner, and they fell upon their knees,\r\nweeping so bitterly that it seemed as if they were to be led out to their\r\ndeaths.  Afterwards, they withdrew to their chambers, and it was time for\r\ndinner.  After dinner, there was little sitting ere the good knight\r\ncalled for the horses; for much he longed to be in the company so yearned\r\nfor by him, having fine fear lest the battle should be delivered before\r\nhe was there.  As he was coming out of his chamber to mount a-horseback,\r\nthe two fair daughters of the house came down and made him, each of them,\r\na present which they had worked during his illness; one was two pretty\r\nand delicate bracelets, made of beautiful tresses of gold and silver\r\nthread, so neatly that it was a marvel; the other was a purse of crimson\r\nsatin, worked right cunningly.  Greatly did he thank them, saying that\r\nthe present came from hand so fair, that he valued it at ten thousand\r\ncrowns; and, in order to do them the more honor, he had the bracelets put\r\nupon his arms, and he put the purse in his sleeve, assuring them that, so\r\nlong as they lasted, he would wear them for love of the givers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bayard’s Farewell----358]\r\n\r\nBayard had good reason for being in such a hurry to rejoin his\r\ncomrades-in-arms, and not miss the battle he foresaw.  All were as full\r\nof it as he was.  After the capture of Brescia, Gaston de Foix passed\r\nseven or eight days more there, whilst Bayard was confined by his wound\r\nto his bed.  “The prince went, once at least, every day to see the good\r\nknight, the which he comforted as best he might, and often said to him,\r\n‘Hey! Sir Bayard, my friend, think about getting cured, for well I know\r\nthat we shall have to give the Spaniards battle between this and a month;\r\nand, if so it should be, I had rather have lost all I am worth than not\r\nhave you there, so great confidence have I in you.’  ‘Believe me, my\r\nlord,’ answered Bayard, ‘that if so it is that there is to be a battle, I\r\nwould, as well for the service of the king my master as for love of you\r\nand for mine own honor, which is before everything, rather have myself\r\ncarried thither in a litter than not be there at all.’  The Duke of\r\nNemours made him a load of presents according to his power, and one day\r\nsent him five hundred crowns, the which the good knight gave to the two\r\narchers who had staid with him when he was wounded.”\r\n\r\nLouis XII. was as impatient to have the battle delivered as Bayard was to\r\nbe in it.  He wrote, time after time, to his nephew Gaston that the\r\nmoment was critical, that Emperor Maximilian harbored a design of\r\nrecalling the five thousand lanzknechts he had sent as auxiliaries to the\r\nFrench army, and that they must be made use of whilst they were still to\r\nbe had; that, on the other hand, Henry VIII., King of England, was\r\npreparing for an invasion of France, and so was Ferdinand, King of Spain,\r\nin the south: a victory in the field was indispensable to baffle all\r\nthese hostile plans.  It was Louis XII.’s mania to direct, from Paris or\r\nfrom Lyons, the war which he was making at a distance, and to regulate\r\nits movements as well as its expenses.  The Florentine ambassador,\r\nPandolfini, was struck with the perilousness of this mania; and Cardinal\r\nd’Amboise was no longer by to oppose it.  Gaston de Foix asked for\r\nnothing better than to act with vigor.  He set out to march on Ravenna,\r\nin hopes that by laying siege to this important place he would force a\r\nbattle upon the Spanish army, which sought to avoid it.  There was a\r\ncurrent rumor in Italy that this army, much reduced in numbers and cooled\r\nin ardor, would not hold its own against the French if it encountered\r\nthem.  Some weeks previously, after the siege of Bologna had been raised_\r\nby the Spaniards, there were distributed about at Rome little bits of\r\npaper having on them, “If anybody knows where the Spanish army happens to\r\nbe, let him inform the sacristan of peace; he shall receive as reward a\r\nlump of cheese.”  Gaston de Foix arrived on the 8th of April, 1512,\r\nbefore Ravenna.  He there learned that, on the 9th of March, the\r\nambassador of France had been sent away from London by Henry VIII.\r\nAnother hint came to him from his own camp.  A German captain, named\r\nJacob, went and told Chevalier Bayard, with whom he had contracted a\r\nfriendship, “that the emperor had sent orders to the captain of the\r\nlanzknechts that they were to withdraw incontinently on seeing his\r\nletter, and that they were not to fight the Spaniards: ‘As for me,’ said\r\nhe, ‘I have taken oath to the King of France, and I have his pay; if I\r\nwere to die a hundred thousand deaths, I would not do this wickedness of\r\nnot fighting; but there must be haste.’  The good knight, who well knew\r\nthe gentle heart of Captain Jacob, commended him marvellously, and said\r\nto him, by the mouth of his interpreter, ‘My dear comrade and friend,\r\nnever did your heart imagine wickedness.  Here is my lord of Nemours, who\r\nhas ordered to his quarters all the captains, to hold a council; go we\r\nthither, you and I, and we will show him privately what you have told\r\nme.’  ‘It is well thought on,’ said Captain Jacob: ‘go we thither.’  So\r\nthey went thither.  There were dissensions at the council: some said that\r\nthey had three or four rivers to cross; that everybody was against them,\r\nthe pope, the King of Spain, the Venetians, and the Swiss; that the\r\nemperor was anything but certain, and that the best thing would be to\r\ntemporize: others said that there was nothing for it but to fight or die\r\nof hunger like good-for-noughts and cowards.  The good Duke of Nemours,\r\nwho had already spoken with the good knight and with Captain Jacob,\r\ndesired to have the opinion of the former, the which said, ‘My lord, the\r\nlonger we sojourn, the more miserable too will become our plight, for our\r\nmen have no victual, and our horses must needs live on what the willows\r\nshoot forth at the present time.  Besides, you know that the king our\r\nmaster is writing to you every day to give battle, and that in your hands\r\nrests, not only the safety of his duchy of Milan, but also all his\r\ndominion of France, seeing the enemies he has to-day.  ‘Wherefore, as for\r\nme, I am of opinion that we ought to give battle, and proceed to it\r\ndiscreetly, for we have to do with cunning folks and good fighters.  That\r\nthere is peril in it is true; but one thing gives me comfort: the\r\nSpaniards for a year past have, in this Romagna, been always living like\r\nfish in the water, and are fat and full-fed; our men have had and still\r\nhave great lack of victual, whereby they will have longer breath, and we\r\nhave no need of ought else, for whoso fights the longest, to him will\r\nremain the ‘field.’”  The leaders of note in the army sided with the good\r\nknight, “and notice thereof was at once given to all the captains of\r\nhorse and foot.”\r\n\r\nThe battle took place on the next day but one, April 11.  “The gentle\r\nDuke of Nemours set out pretty early from his quarters, armed at all\r\npoints.  As he went forth he looked at the sun, already risen, which was\r\nmighty red.  ‘Look, my lords, how red the sun is,’ said he to the company\r\nabout him.  There was there a gentleman whom he loved exceedingly, a\r\nright gentle comrade, whose name was Haubourdin, the which replied, ‘Know\r\nyou, pray, what that means, my lord?  To-day will die some prince or\r\ngreat captain: it must needs be you or the Spanish viceroy.’  The Duke of\r\nNemours burst out a-laughing at this speech, and went on as far as the\r\nbridge to finish the passing-in-review of his army, which was showing\r\nmarvellous diligence.”  As he was conversing with Bayard, who had come in\r\nsearch of him, they noticed not far from them a troop of twenty or thirty\r\nSpanish gentlemen, all mounted, amongst whom was Captain Pedro de Paz,\r\nleader of all their jennettiers [light cavalry, mounted on Spanish horses\r\ncalled jennets].  “The good knight advanced twenty or thirty paces and\r\nsaluted them, saying, ‘Gentlemen, you are diverting your-selves, as we\r\nare, whilst waiting for the regular game to begin; I pray you let there\r\nbe no firing of arquebuses on your side, and there shall be no firing at\r\nyou on ours.’”  The courtesy was reciprocated.  “Sir Bayard,” asked Don\r\nPedro de Paz, who is yon lord in such goodly array, and to whom your\r\nfolks show so much honor?”  “It is our chief, the Duke of Nemours,”\r\n answered Bayard; “nephew of our prince, and brother of your queen.”\r\n [Germaine de Foix, Gaston de Foix’s sister, had married, as his second\r\nwife, Ferdinand the Catholic.] Hardly had he finished speaking, when\r\nCaptain Pedro de Paz and all those who were with him dismounted and\r\naddressed the noble prince in these words: “Sir, save the honor and\r\nservice due to the king our master, we declare to you that we are, and\r\nwish forever to remain, your servants.”  The Duke of Nemours thanked them\r\ngallantly for their gallant homage, and, after a short, chivalrous\r\nexchange of conversation, they went, respectively, to their own posts.\r\nThe artillery began by causing great havoc on both sides.  “‘Od’s body,”\r\n said a Spanish captain shut up in a fort which the French were attacking,\r\nand which he had been charged to defend, “we are being killed here by\r\nbolts that fall from heaven; go we and fight with men;” and he sallied\r\nfrom the fort with all his people, to go and take part in the general\r\nbattle.  “Since God created heaven and earth,” says the Loyal Serviteur\r\nof Bayard, “was never seen a more cruel and rough assault than that which\r\nFrench and Spaniards made upon one another, and for more than a long half\r\nhour lasted this fight.  They rested before one another’s eyes to recover\r\ntheir breath; then they let down their vizors and so began all over\r\nagain, shouting, France! and Spain! the most imperiously in the world.\r\nAt last the Spaniards were utterly broken, and constrained to abandon\r\ntheir camp, whereon, and between two ditches, died three or four hundred\r\nmen-at-arms.  Every one would fain have set out in pursuit; but the good\r\nknight said to the Duke of Nemours, who was all covered with blood and\r\nbrains from one of his men-at-arms, that had been carried off by a\r\ncannon-ball, ‘My lord, are you wounded?’  ‘No,’ said the duke, ‘but I\r\nhave wounded a many others.’  ‘Now, God be praised!’ said Bayard; ‘you\r\nhave gained the battle, and abide this day the most honored prince in the\r\nworld; but push not farther forward; reassemble your men-at-arms in this\r\nspot; let none set on to pillage yet, for it is not time; Captain Louis\r\nd’Ars and I are off after these fugitives that they may not retire behind\r\ntheir foot; but stir not, for any man living, from here, unless Captain\r\nLouis d’Ars or I come hither to fetch you.’  “The Duke of Nemours\r\npromised; but whilst he was biding on his ground, awaiting Bayard’s\r\nreturn, he said to the Baron du Chimay,--“an honest gentleman who had\r\nknowledge,” says Fleuranges, “of things to come, and who, before the\r\nbattle, had announced to Gaston that he would gain it, but he would be in\r\ndanger of being left there if God did not do him grace,--Well, Sir\r\nDotard, am I left there, as you said?  Here I am still.’  ‘Sir, it is not\r\nall over yet,’ answered Chimay; whereupon there arrived an archer, who\r\ncame and said to the duke, ‘My lord, yonder be two thousand Spaniards,\r\nwho are going off all orderly along the causeway.’  ‘Certes,’ said\r\nGaston, ‘I cannot suffer that; whoso loves me, follow me.’  And resuming\r\nhis arms he pushed forward.  ‘Wait for your men,’ said Sire de Lautrec to\r\nhim; but Gaston took no heed, and followed by only twenty or thirty\r\nmen-at-arms, he threw himself upon those retreating troops.”  He was\r\nimmediately surrounded, thrown from his horse, and defending himself all\r\nthe while, “like Roland at Roncesvalles,” say the chroniclers, he fell\r\npierced with wounds.  “Do not kill him,” shouted Lautrec; “it is the\r\nbrother of your queen.”  Lautrec himself was so severely handled and\r\nwounded that he was thought to be dead.  Gaston really was, though the\r\nnews spread but slowly.  Bayard, returning with his comrades from\r\npursuing the fugitives, met on his road the Spanish force that Gaston had\r\nso rashly attacked, and that continued to retire in good order.  Bayard\r\nwas all but charging them, when a Spanish captain came out of the ranks\r\nand said to him, in his own language, “What would you do, sir?  You are\r\nnot powerful enough to beat us; you have won the battle; let the honor\r\nthereof suffice you, and let us go with our lives, for by God’s will are\r\nwe escaped.”  Bayard felt that the Spaniard spoke truly; he had but a\r\nhandful of men with him, and his own horse could not carry him any\r\nlonger: the Spaniards opened their ranks, and he passed through the\r\nmiddle of them and let them go.  “‘Las!” says his Loyal Serviteur, “he\r\nknew not that the good Duke of Nemours was dead, or that those yonder\r\nwere they who had slain him; he had died ten thousand deaths but he would\r\nhave avenged him, if he had known it.”\r\n\r\nWhen the fatal news was known, the consternation and grief were profound.\r\nAt the age of twenty-three Gaston de Foix had in less than six months won\r\nthe confidence and affection of the army, of the king, and of France.  It\r\nwas one of those sudden and undisputed reputations which seem to mark out\r\nmen for the highest destinies.  “I would fain,” said Louis XIL, when he\r\nheard of his death, “have no longer an inch of land in Italy, and be able\r\nat that price to bring back to life my nephew Gaston and all the gallants\r\nwho perished with him.  God keep us from often gaining such victories!”\r\n “In the battle of Ravenna,” says Guicciardini, “fell at least ten\r\nthousand men, a third of them French, and two thirds their enemies; but\r\nin respect of chosen men and men of renown the loss of the victors was by\r\nmuch the greater, and the loss of Gaston de Foix alone surpassed all the\r\nothers put together; with him went all the vigor and furious onset of the\r\nFrench army.”  La Palisse, a warrior valiant and honored, assumed the\r\ncommand of this victorious army; but under pressure of repeated attacks\r\nfrom the Spaniards, the Venetians, and the Swiss, he gave up first the\r\nRomagna, then Milanes, withdrew from place to place, and ended by falling\r\nback on Piedmont.  Julius II. won back all he had won and lost.\r\nMaximilian Sforza, son of Ludovic the Moor, after twelve years of exile\r\nin Germany, returned to Milan to resume possession of his father’s duchy.\r\nBy the end of June, 1512, less than three months after the victory of\r\nRavenna, the domination of the French had disappeared from Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gaston de Foix----364]\r\n\r\nLouis XII. had, indeed, something else to do besides crossing the Alps to\r\ngo to the protection of such precarious conquests.  Into France itself\r\nwar was about to make its way; it was his own kingdom and his own country\r\nthat he had to defend.  In vain, after the death of Isabella of Castile,\r\nhad he married his niece, Germaine de Foix, to Ferdinand the Catholic,\r\nwhilst giving up to him all pretensions to the kingdom of Naples.  In\r\n1512 Ferdinand invaded Navarre, took possession of the Spanish portion of\r\nthat little kingdom, and thence threatened Gascony.  Henry VIII., King of\r\nEngland, sent him a fleet, which did not withdraw until after it had\r\nappeared before Bayonne and thrown the south-west of France into a state\r\nof alarm.  In the north, Henry VIII. continued his preparations for an\r\nexpedition into France, obtained from his Parliament subsidies for that\r\npurpose, and concerted plans with Emperor Maximilian, who renounced his\r\ndoubtful neutrality and engaged himself at last in the Holy League.\r\nLouis XII. had in Germany an enemy as zealous almost as Julius II. was in\r\nItaly: Maximilian’s daughter, Princess Marguerite of Austria, had never\r\nforgiven France or its king, whether he were called Charles VIII. or\r\nLouis XII., the treatment she had received from that court, when, after\r\nhaving been kept there and brought up for eight years to become Queen of\r\nFrance, she had been sent away and handed back to her father, to make way\r\nfor Anne of Brittany.  She was ruler of the Low Countries, active, able,\r\nfull of passion, and in continual correspondence with her father, the\r\nemperor, over whom she exercised a great deal of influence.  [This\r\ncorrespondence was published in 1839, by the _Societe de l’Histoire de\r\nFrance_ (2 vols.  8vo.), from the originals, which exist in the archives\r\nof Lille.] The Swiss, on their side, continuing to smart under the\r\ncontemptuous language which Louis had imprudently applied to them, became\r\nmore and more pronounced against him, rudely dismissed Louis de la\r\nTremoille, who attempted to negotiate with them, re-established\r\nMaximilian Sforza in the duchy of Milan, and haughtily styled themselves\r\n“vanquishers of kings and defenders of the holy Roman Church.”  And the\r\nRoman Church made a good defender of herself.  Julius II. had convoked at\r\nRome, at St. John Lateran, a council, which met on the 3d of May, 1512,\r\nand in presence of which the council of Pisa and Milan, after an attempt\r\nat removing to Lyons, vanished away like a phantom.  Everywhere things\r\nwere turning out according to the wishes and for the profit of the pope;\r\nand France and her king were reduced to defending themselves on their own\r\nsoil against a coalition of all their great neighbors.\r\n\r\n“Man proposes and God disposes.”  Not a step can be made in history\r\nwithout meeting with some corroboration of that modest, pious, grand\r\ntruth.  On the 21st of February, 1513, ten months since Gaston de Foix,\r\nthe victor of Ravenna, had perished in the hour of his victory, Pope\r\nJulius II. died at Rome at the very moment when he seemed invited to\r\nenjoy all the triumph of his policy.  He died without bluster and without\r\ndisquietude, disavowing nought of his past life, and relinquishing none\r\nof his designs as to the future.  He had been impassioned and skilful in\r\nthe employment of moral force, whereby alone he could become master of\r\nmaterial forces; a rare order of genius, and one which never lacks\r\ngrandeur, even when the man who possesses it abuses it.  His constant\r\nthought was how he might free Italy from the barbarians; and he liked to\r\nhear himself called by the name of liberator, which was commonly given\r\nhim.  One day the outspoken Cardinal Grimani said to him that,\r\nnevertheless, the kingdom of Naples, one of the greatest and richest\r\nportions of Italy, was still under the foreign yoke; whereupon Julius\r\nII., brandishing the staff on which he was leaning, said, wrathfully,\r\n“Assuredly, if Heaven had not otherwise ordained, the Neapolitans too\r\nwould have shaken off the yoke which lies heavy on them.”  Guicciardini\r\nhas summed up, with equal justice and sound judgment, the principal\r\ntraits of his character: “He was a prince,” says the historian, “of\r\nincalculable courage and firmness; full of boundless imaginings which\r\nwould have brought him headlong to ruin if the respect borne to the\r\nChurch, the dissensions of princes and the conditions of the times, far\r\nmore than his own moderation and prudence, had not supported him; he\r\nwould have been worthy of higher glory had he been a laic prince, or had\r\nit been in order to elevate the Church in spiritual rank and by processes\r\nof peace that he put in practice the diligence and zeal he displayed for\r\nthe purpose of augmenting his temporal greatness by the arts of war.\r\nNevertheless he has left, above all his predecessors, a memory full of\r\nfame and honor, especially amongst those men who can no longer call\r\nthings by their right names or appreciate them at their true value, and\r\nwho think that it is the duty of the sovereign-pontiffs to extend, by\r\nmeans of arms and the blood of Christians, the power of the Holy See\r\nrather than to wear themselves out in setting good examples of a\r\nChristian’s life and in reforming manners and customs pernicious to the\r\nsalvation of souls--that aim of aims for which they assert that Christ\r\nhas appointed them His vicars on earth.”\r\n\r\nThe death of Julius II. seemed to Louis XII. a favorable opportunity for\r\nonce more setting foot in Italy, and recovering at least that which he\r\nregarded as his hereditary right, the duchy of Milan.  He commissioned\r\nLouis de la Tremoille to go and renew the conquest; and, whilst thus\r\nreopening the Italian war, he commenced negotiations with certain of the\r\ncoalitionists of the Holy League, in the hope of causing division amongst\r\nthem, or even of attracting some one of them to himself.  He knew that\r\nthe Venetians were dissatisfied and disquieted about their allies,\r\nespecially Emperor Maximilian, the new Duke of Milan Maximilian Sforza,\r\nand the Swiss.  He had little difficulty in coming to an understanding\r\nwith the Venetian senate; and, on the 14th of May, 1513, a treaty of\r\nalliance, offensive and defensive, was signed at Blois between the King\r\nof France and the republic of Venice.  Louis hoped also to find at Rome\r\nin the new pope, Leo X.  [Cardinal John de’ Medici, elected pope March\r\n11, 1513], favorable inclinations; but they were at first very\r\nambiguously and reservedly manifested.  As a Florentine, Leo X. had a\r\nleaning towards France; but as pope, he was not disposed to relinquish or\r\ndisavow the policy of Julius II. as to the independence of Italy in\r\nrespect of any foreign sovereign, and as to the extension of the power of\r\nthe Holy See; and he wanted time to make up his mind to infuse into his\r\nrelations with Louis XII. good-will instead of his predecessor’s\r\nimpassioned hostility.  Louis had not, and could not have, any confidence\r\nin Ferdinand the Catholic; but he knew him to be as prudent as he was\r\nrascally, and he concluded with him at Orthez, on the 1st of April, 1513,\r\na year’s truce, which Ferdinand took great care not to make known to his\r\nallies, Henry VIII., King of England, and the Emperor Maximilian, the\r\nformer of whom was very hot-tempered, and the latter very deeply\r\ninvolved, through his daughter Marguerite of Austria, in the warlike\r\nleague against France.  “Madam” [the name given to Marguerite as ruler of\r\nthe Low Countries], wrote the Florentine minister to Lorenzo de’ Medici,\r\n“asks for nought but war against the Most Christian king; she thinks of\r\nnought but keeping up and fanning the kindled fire, and she has all the\r\ngame in her hands, for the King of England and the emperor have full\r\nconfidence in her, and she does with them just as she pleases.”  This was\r\nall that was gained during the year of Julius II.’s death by Louis XII.’s\r\nattempts to break up or weaken the coalition against France; and these\r\nfeeble diplomatic advantages were soon nullified by the unsuccess of the\r\nFrench expedition in Milaness.  Louis de la Tremoille had once more\r\nentered it with a strong army; but he was on bad terms with his principal\r\nlieutenant, John James Trivulzio, over whom he had not the authority\r\nwielded by the young and brilliant Gaston de Foix; the French were close\r\nto Novara, the siege of which they were about to commence; they heard\r\nthat a body of Swiss was advancing to enter the place; La Tremoille\r\nshifted his position to oppose them, and on the 5th of June, 1513, he\r\ntold all his captains in the evening that “they might go to their\r\nsleeping-quarters and make good cheer, for the Swiss were not yet ready\r\nto fight, not having all their men assembled;” but early next morning the\r\nSwiss attacked the French camp.  “La Tremoille had hardly time to rise,\r\nand, with half his armor on, mount his horse; the Swiss outposts and\r\nthose of the French were already at work pell-mell over against his\r\nquarters.”  The battle was hot and bravely contested on both sides; but\r\nthe Swiss by a vigorous effort got possession of the French artillery,\r\nand turned it against the infantry of the lanzknechts, which was driven\r\nin and broken.  The French army abandoned the siege of Novara, and put\r\nitself in retreat, first of all on Verceil, a town of Piedmont, and then\r\non France itself.  “And I do assure you,” says Fleuranges, an eye-witness\r\nand partaker in the battle, “that there was great need of it; of the\r\nmen-at-arms there were but few lost, or of the French foot; which turned\r\nout a marvellous good thing for the king and the kingdom, for they found\r\nhim very much embroiled with the English and other nations.”  War\r\nbetween, France and England had recommenced at sea in 1512: two\r\nsquadrons, one French, of twenty sail, and the other English, of more\r\nthan forty, met on the 10th of August somewhere off the island of Ushant;\r\na brave Breton, Admiral Herve Primoguet, aboard of “the great ship of the\r\nQueen of France,” named the Cordeliere, commanded the French squadron,\r\nand Sir Thomas Knyvet, a young sailor “of more bravery than experience,”\r\n according to the historians of his own country, commanded, on board of a\r\nvessel named the Regent, the English squadron.  The two admirals’ vessels\r\nengaged in a deadly duel; but the French admiral, finding himself\r\nsurrounded by superior forces, threw his grappling-irons on to the\r\nEnglish vessel, and, rather than surrender, set fire to the two admirals’\r\nships, which blew up at the same time, together with their crews of two\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nThe sight of heroism and death has a powerful effect upon men, and\r\nsometimes suspends their quarrels.  The English squadron went out again\r\nto sea, and the French went back to Brest.  Next year the struggle\r\nrecommenced, but on land, and with nothing so striking.  An English army\r\nstarted from Calais, and went and blockaded, on the 17th of June, 1513,\r\nthe fortress of Therouanne in Artois.  It was a fortnight afterwards\r\nbefore Henry VIII. himself quitted Calais, where festivities and\r\ntournaments had detained him too long for what he had in hand, and set\r\nout on the march with twelve thousand foot to go and join his army before\r\nTherouanne.  He met on his road, near Thournehem, a body of twelve\r\nhundred French men-at-arms with their followers a-horseback, and in the\r\nmidst of them Bayard.  Sire de Piennes, governor of Picardy, was in\r\ncommand of them.  “My lord,” said Bayard to him, “let us charge them: no\r\nharm can come of it to us, or very little; if, at the first charge, we\r\nmake an opening in them, they are broken; if they repulse us, we shall\r\nstill get away; they are on foot and we a-horseback;” and “nearly all the\r\nFrench were of this opinion,” continues the chronicler;  but Sire de\r\nPiennes said, Gentlemen, I have orders, on my life, from the king our\r\nmaster, to risk nothing, but only hold his country.  Do as you please;\r\nfor my part I shall not consent thereto.’  Thus was this matter stayed;\r\nand the King of England passed with his band under the noses of the\r\nFrench.”  Henry VIII. arrived quietly with his army before Therouanne,\r\nthe garrison of which defended itself valiantly, though short of\r\nprovisions.  Louis XII. sent orders to Sire de Piennes to revictual\r\nTherouanne “at any price.”  The French men-at-arms, to the number of\r\nfourteen hundred lances, at whose head marched La Palisse, Bayard, the\r\nDuke de Longueville, grandson of the great Dunois, and Sire de Piennes\r\nhimself, set out on the 16th of August to go and make, from the direction\r\nof Guinegate, a sham attack upon the English camp, whilst eight hundred\r\nAlbanian light cavalry were to burst, from another direction, upon the\r\nenemies’ lines, cut their way through at a gallop, penetrate to the very\r\nfosses of the fortress, and throw into them munitions of war and of the\r\nstomach, hung to their horses’ necks.  The Albanians carried out their\r\norders successfully.  The French men-at-arms, after having skirmished for\r\nsome time with the cavalry of Henry VIII. and Maximilian, began to fall\r\nback a little carelessly and in some disorder towards their own camp,\r\nwhen they perceived two large masses of infantry and artillery, English\r\nand German, preparing to cut off their retreat.  Surprise led to\r\nconfusion; the confusion took the form of panic; the French men-at-arms\r\nbroke into a gallop, and, dispersing in all directions, thought of\r\nnothing but regaining the main body and the camp at Blangy.  This sudden\r\nrout of so many gallants received the sorry name of the affair of spurs,\r\nfor spurs did more service than the sword.  Many a chosen captain, the\r\nDuke de Longueville, Sire de la Palisse, and Bayard, whilst trying to\r\nrally the fugitives, were taken by the enemy.  Emperor Maximilian, who\r\nhad arrived at the English camp three or four days before the affair, was\r\nof opinion that the allies should march straight upon the French camp, to\r\ntake advantage of the panic and disorder; but “Henry VIII. and his lords\r\ndid not agree with him.”  They contented themselves with pressing on the\r\nsiege of Therouanne, which capitulated on the 22d of August, for want of\r\nprovisions.  The garrison was allowed to go free, the men-at-arms with\r\nlance on thigh and the foot with pike on shoulder, with their harness and\r\nall that they could carry.”  But, in spite of an article in the\r\ncapitulation, the town was completely dismantled and burnt; and, by the\r\nadvice of Emperor Maximilian, Henry VIII. made all haste to go and lay\r\nsiege to Tournai, a French fortress between Flanders and Hainault, the\r\ncapture of which was of great importance to the Low Countries and to\r\nMarguerite of Austria, their ruler.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these sad tidings, Louis XII., though suffering from an attack\r\nof gout, had himself moved in a litter from Paris to Amiens, and ordered\r\nPrince Francis of Angouleme, heir to the throne, to go and take command\r\nof the army, march it back to the defensive line of the Somme, and send a\r\ngarrison to Tournai.  It was one of that town’s privileges to have no\r\ngarrison; and the inhabitants were unwilling to admit one, saying that\r\nTournai never had turned and never would turn tail; and, if the English\r\ncame, they would find some one to talk to them.”  “Howbeit,” says\r\nFleuranges, “not a single captain was there, nor, likewise, the said lord\r\nduke, but understood well how it was with people besieged, as indeed came\r\nto pass, for at the end of three days, during which the people of Tournai\r\nwere besieged, they treated for appointment (terms) with the King of\r\nEngland.”  Other bad news came to Amiens.  The Swiss, puffed up with\r\ntheir victory at Novara and egged on by Emperor Maximilian, had to the\r\nnumber of thirty thousand entered Burgundy, and on the 7th of September\r\nlaid siege to Dijon, which was rather badly fortified.  La Tremoille,\r\ngovernor of Burgundy, shut himself up in the place and bravely repulsed a\r\nfirst assault, but “sent post-haste to warn the king to send him aid;\r\nwhereto the king made no reply beyond that he could not send him aid, and\r\nthat La Tremoille should do the best he could for the advantage and\r\nservice of the kingdom.”  La Tremoille applied to the Swiss for a\r\nsafe-conduct, and “without arms and scantily attended” he went to them to\r\ntry whether “in consideration of a certain sum of money for the expenses\r\nof their army they could be packed off to their own country without doing\r\nfurther displeasure or damage.”  He found them proud and arrogant of\r\nheart, for they styled themselves chastisers of princes,” and all he\r\ncould obtain from them was “that the king should give up the duchy of\r\nMilan and all the castles appertaining thereto, that he should restore to\r\nthe pope all the towns, castles, lands, and lordships which belonged to\r\nhim, and that he should pay the Swiss four hundred thousand crowns, to\r\nwit, two hundred thousand down and two hundred thousand at Martinmas in\r\nthe following winter.”  [_Corps Diplomatique du Droit des Gens,_ by\r\nDumont, t. vi.  part 1, p. 175.]  As brave in undertaking a heavy\r\nresponsibility as he was in delivering a battle, La Tremoille did not\r\nhesitate to sign, on the 13th of September, this harsh treaty; and, as he\r\nhad not two hundred thousand crowns down to give the Swiss, he prevailed\r\nupon them to be content with receiving twenty thousand at once, and he\r\nleft with them as hostage, in pledge of his promise, his nephew Rend\r\nd’Anjou, lord of Mezieres, “one of the boldest and discreetest knights in\r\nFrance.”  But for this honorable defeat, the veteran warrior thought the\r\nkingdom of France had been then undone; for, assailed at all its\r\nextremities, with its neighbors for its foes, it could not, without great\r\nrisk of final ruin, have borne the burden and defended itself through so\r\nmany battles.  La Tremoille sent one of the gentlemen of his house, the\r\nchevalier Reginald de Moussy, to the king, to give an account of what he\r\nhad done, and of his motives.  Some gentlemen about the persons of the\r\nking and the queen had implanted some seeds of murmuring and evil\r\nthinking in the mind of the queen, and through her in that of the king,\r\nwho readily gave ear to her words because good and discreet was she. The\r\nsaid Reginald de Moussy, having warning of the fact, and without\r\nborrowing aid of a soul (for bold man was he by reason of his virtues),\r\nentered the king’s chamber, and, falling on one knee, announced,\r\naccording to order, the service which his master had done, and without\r\nwhich the kingdom of France was in danger of ruin, whereof he set forth\r\nthe reasons.  The whole was said in presence of them who had brought the\r\nking to that evil way of thinking, and who knew not what to reply to the\r\nking when he said to them, ‘By the faith of my body, I think and do know\r\nby experience that my cousin the lord of La Tremoille is the most\r\nfaithful and loyal servant that I have in my kingdom, and the one to whom\r\nI am most bounden to the best of his abilities.  Go, Reginald, and tell\r\nhim that I will do all that he has promised; and if he has done well, let\r\nhim do better.’  The queen heard of this kind answer made by the king,\r\nand was not pleased at it; but afterwards, the truth being known, she\r\njudged contrariwise to what she, through false report, had imagined and\r\nthought.”  [_Memoires de la Tremoille,_ in the Petitot collection,\r\nt. xiv.  pp. 476-492.]\r\n\r\nWord was brought at the same time to Amiens that Tournai, invested on the\r\n15th of September by the English, had capitulated, that Henry VIII. had\r\nentered it on the 21st, and that he had immediately treated it as a\r\nconquest of which he was taking possession, for he had confirmed it in\r\nall its privileges except that of having no garrison.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation in which France, after a reign of fifteen years\r\nand in spite of so many brave and devoted servants, had been placed by\r\nLouis XII.’s foreign policy.  Had he managed the home affairs of his\r\nkingdom as badly and with as little success as he had matters abroad, is\r\nit necessary to say what would have been his people’s feelings towards\r\nhim, and what name he would have left in history?  Happily for France and\r\nfor the memory of Louis XII., his home-government was more sensible, more\r\nclear-sighted, more able, more moral, and more productive of good results\r\nthan his foreign policy was.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider this reign from this new point of view, we are at\r\nonce struck by two facts: 1st, the great number of legislative and\r\nadministrative acts that we meet with bearing upon the general interests\r\nof the country, interests political, judicial, financial, and commercial;\r\nthe _Recueil des Ordonnances des Rois de France_ contains forty-three\r\nimportant acts of this sort owing their origin to Louis XII.; it was\r\nclearly a government full of watchfulness, activity, and attention to\r\ngood order and the public weal; 2d, the profound remembrance remaining in\r\nsucceeding ages of this reign and its deserts--a remembrance which was\r\nmanifested, in 1560, amongst the states-general of Orleans, in 1576 and\r\n1588 amongst the states of Blois, in 1593 amongst the states of the\r\nLeague, and even down to 1614 amongst the states of Paris.  During more\r\nthan a hundred years France called to mind, and took pleasure in calling\r\nto mind, the administration of Louis XII. as the type of a wise,\r\nintelligent, and effective regimen.  Confidence may be felt in a people’s\r\nmemory when it inspires them for so long afterwards with sentiment of\r\njustice and gratitude.\r\n\r\nIf from the simple table of the acts of Louis XII.’s home-government we\r\npass to an examination of their practical results it is plain that they\r\nwere good and salutary.  A contemporary historian, earnest and truthful\r\nthough panegyrical, Claude do Seyssel, describes in the following terms\r\nthe state of France at that time: “It is,” says he, “a patent fact that\r\nthe revenue of benefices, lands, and lordships has generally much\r\nincreased.  And in like manner the proceeds of gabels, turnpikes, law-\r\nfees and other revenues have been augmented very greatly.  The traffic,\r\ntoo, in merchandise, whether by sea or land, has multiplied exceedingly.\r\nFor, by the blessing of peace, all folks (except the nobles, and even\r\nthem I do not except altogether) engage in merchandise.  For one trader\r\nthat was in Louis XI.’s time to be found rich and portly at Paris, Rouen,\r\nLyons, and other good towns of the kingdom, there are to be found in this\r\nreign more than fifty; and there are in the small towns greater number\r\nthan the great and principal cities were wont to have.  So much so that\r\nscarcely a house is made on any street without having a shop for\r\nmerchandise or for mechanical art.  And less difficulty is now made about\r\ngoing to Rome, Naples London, and elsewhere over-sea than was made\r\nformally about going to Lyons or to Geneva.  So much so that there are\r\nsome who have gone by sea to seek, and have found, new homes.  The renown\r\nand authority of the king now reigning are so great that his subjects are\r\nhonored and upheld in every country, as well at sea as on land.”\r\n\r\nForeigners were not less impressed than the French themselves with this\r\nadvance in order, activity, and prosperity amongst the French community.\r\nMachiavelli admits it, and with the melancholy of an Italian politician\r\nacting in the midst of rivalries amongst the Italian republics, he\r\nattributes it above all to French unity, superior to that of any other\r\nstate in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs to the question, to whom reverts the honor of the good government at\r\nhome under Louis XII., and of so much progress in the social condition of\r\nFrance, M. George Picot, in his _Histoire des Etats Generaux_ [t. i.  pp.\r\n532-536], attributes it especially to the influence of the states\r\nassembled at Tours, in 1484, at the beginning of the reign of Charles\r\nVIII.: “They employed,” he says, “the greatest efforts to reduce the\r\nfigure of the impost; they claimed the voting of subsidies, and took care\r\nnot to allow them, save by way of gift and grant.  They did not hesitate\r\nto revise certain taxes, and when they were engaged upon the subject of\r\ncollecting of them, they energetically stood out for the establishment of\r\na unique, classified body of receivers-royal, and demanded the formation\r\nof all the provinces into districts of estates, voting and apportioning\r\ntheir imposts every year, as in the cases of Languedoc, Normandy, and\r\nDauphiny.  The dangers of want of discipline in an ill-organized standing\r\narmy and the evils caused to agriculture by roving bands drove the states\r\nback to reminiscences of Charles VII.’s armies; and they called for a\r\nmixed organization, in which gratuitous service, commingled in just\r\nproportion with that of paid troops, would prevent absorption of the\r\nnational element.  To reform the abuses of the law, to suppress\r\nextraordinary commissions, to reduce to a powerful unity, with\r\nparliaments to crown all, that multitude of jurisdictions which were\r\ndegenerate and corrupt products of the feudal system in its decay, such\r\nwas the constant aim of the states-general of 1484.  They saw that a\r\njudicial hierarchy would be vain without fixity of laws; and they\r\ndemanded a summarization of customs and a consolidation of ordinances in\r\na collection placed within reach of all.  Lastly they made a claim, which\r\nthey were as qualified to make as they were intelligent in making, for\r\nthe removal of the commercial barriers which divided the provinces and\r\nprevented the free transport of merchandise.  They pointed out the\r\nrepairing of the roads and the placing of them in good condition as the\r\nfirst means of increasing the general prosperity.  Not a single branch of\r\nthe administration of the kingdom escaped their conscientious scrutiny:\r\nlaw, finance, and commerce by turns engaged their attention; and in all\r\nthese different matters they sought to ameliorate institutions, but never\r\nto usurp power.  They did not come forward like the shrievalty of the\r\nUniversity of Paris in 1413, with a new system of administration; the\r\nreign of Louis XI. had left nothing that was important or possible, in\r\nthat way, to conceive; there was nothing more to be done than to glean\r\nafter him, to relax those appliances of government which he had stretched\r\nat all points, and to demand the accomplishment of such of his projects\r\nas were left in arrear and the cure of the evils he had caused by the\r\nfrenzy and the aberrations of his absolute will.”\r\n\r\nWe do not care to question the merits of the states-general of 1484; we\r\nhave but lately striven to bring them to light, and we doubt not but that\r\nthe enduring influence of their example and their sufferings counted for\r\nmuch in the progress of good government during the reign of Louis XII.\r\nIt is an honor to France to have always resumed and pursued from crisis\r\nto crisis, through a course of many sufferings, mistakes, and tedious\r\ngaps, the work of her political enfranchisement and the foundation of a\r\nregimen of freedom and legality in the midst of the sole monarchy which\r\nso powerfully contributed to her strength and her greatness.  The\r\nstates-general of 1484, in spite of their rebuffs and long years after\r\ntheir separation, held an honorable place in the history of this\r\ndifficult and tardy work; but Louis XII.’s personal share in the good\r\nhome-government of France during his reign was also great and\r\nmeritorious.  His chief merit, a rare one amongst the powerful of the\r\nearth, especially when there is a question of reforms and of liberty, was\r\nthat he understood and entertained the requirements and wishes of his\r\nday; he was a mere young prince of the blood when the states of 1484 were\r\nsitting at Tours; but he did not forget them when he was king, and, far\r\nfrom repudiating their patriotic and modest work in the cause of reform\r\nand progress, he entered into it sincerely and earnestly with the aid\r\nof Cardinal d’Amboise, his honest, faithful, and ever influential\r\ncouncillor.  The character and natural instincts of Louis XII. inclined\r\nhim towards the same views as his intelligence and moderation in politics\r\nsuggested.  He was kind, sympathetic towards his people, and anxious to\r\nspare them every burden and every suffering that was unnecessary, and to\r\nhave justice, real and independent justice, rendered to all.  He reduced\r\nthe talliages a tenth at first and a third at a later period.  He refused\r\nto accept the dues usual on a joyful accession.  When the wars in Italy\r\ncaused him some extraordinary expense, he disposed of a portion of the\r\nroyal possessions, strictly administered as they were, before imposing\r\nfresh burdens upon the people.  His court was inexpensive, and he had no\r\nfavorites to enrich.  His economy became proverbial; it was sometimes\r\nmade a reproach to him; and things were carried so far that he was\r\nrepresented, on the stage of a popular theatre, ill, pale, and surrounded\r\nby doctors, who were holding a consultation as to the nature of his\r\nmalady: they at last agreed to give him a potion of gold to take; the\r\nsick man at once sat up, complaining of nothing more than a burning\r\nthirst.  When informed of this scandalous piece of buffoonery, Louis\r\ncontented himself with saying, “I had rather make courtiers laugh by my\r\nstinginess than my people weep by my extravagance.”  He was pressed to\r\npunish some insolent comedians; but, “No,” said he, “amongst their\r\nribaldries they may sometimes tell us useful truths let them amuse\r\nthemselves, provided that they respect the honor of women.”  In the\r\nadministration of justice he accomplished important reforms, called for\r\nby the states-general of 1484 and promised by Louis XI. and Charles\r\nVIII., but nearly all of them left in suspense.  The purchase of offices\r\nwas abolished and replaced by a two-fold election; in all grades of the\r\nmagistracy, when an office was vacant, the judges were to assemble to\r\nselect three persons, from whom the king should be bound to choose.  The\r\nirremovability of the magistrates, which had been accepted but often\r\nviolated by Louis XI., became under Louis XII. a fundamental rule.  It\r\nwas forbidden to every one of the king’, magistrates, from the premier-\r\npresident to the lowest provost to accept any place or pension from any\r\nlord, under pain of suspension from their office or loss of their salary.\r\nThe annual Mercurials (Wednesday-meetings) became, in the supreme courts,\r\na general and standing usage.  The expenses of the law were reduced.  In\r\n1501, Louis XII. instituted at Aix in Provence a new parliament; in 1499\r\nthe court of exchequer a Rouen, hitherto a supreme but movable and\r\ntemporary court became a fixed and permanent court, which afterwards\r\nreceived under Francis I., the title of parliament.  Being convinced\r\nbefore long, by facts themselves, that these reforms were seriously meant\r\nby their author, and were practically effective, the people conceived, in\r\nconsequence, towards the king and the magistrates a general sentiment of\r\ngratitude and respect.  In 1570 Louis made a journey from Paris to Lyons\r\nby Champaigne and Burgundy; and “wherever he passed,” says St. Gelais”\r\n men and women assembled from all parts, and ran after him for three or\r\nfour leagues.  And when they were able to touch his mule, or his robe, or\r\nanything that was his, they kissed their hands .  .  .  with as great\r\ndevotion as they would have shown to a reliquary.  And the Burgundians\r\nshowed as much enthusiasm as the real old French.”\r\n\r\nLouis XII.’s private life also contributed to win for him, we will not\r\nsay the respect and admiration, but the good will of the public.  He was\r\nnot, like Louis IX., a model of austerity and sanctity; but after the\r\nlicentious court of Charles VII., the coarse habits of Louis XI., and the\r\neasy morals of Charles VIII., the French public was not exacting.  Louis\r\nXII. was thrice married.  His first wife, Joan, daughter of Louis XI.,\r\nwas an excellent and worthy princess, but ugly, ungraceful, and\r\nhump-backed.  He had been almost forced to marry her, and he had no child\r\nby her.  On ascending the throne, he begged Pope Alexander VI. to annul\r\nhis marriage; the negotiation was anything but honorable, either to the\r\nking or to the pope; and the pope granted his bull in consideration of\r\nthe favors shown to his unworthy son, Caesar Borgia, by the king.  Joan\r\nalone behaved with a virtuous as well as modest pride, and ended her life\r\nin sanctity within a convent at Bourges, being wholly devoted to pious\r\nworks, regarded by the people as a saint, spoken of by bold preachers as\r\na martyr, and “still the true and legitimate Queen of France,” and\r\ntreated at a distance with profound respect by the king who had put her\r\naway.  Louis married, in 1499, his predecessor’s widow, Anne, Duchess of\r\nBrittany, twenty-three years of age, short, pretty, a little lame, witty,\r\nable, and firm.  It was, on both sides, a marriage of policy, though\r\nromantic tales have been mixed up with it; it was a suitable and\r\nhonorable royal arrangement, without any lively affection on one side\r\nor the other, but with mutual esteem and regard.  As queen, Anne was\r\nhaughty, imperious, sharp-tempered, and too much inclined to mix in\r\nintrigues and negotiations at Rome and Madrid, sometimes without regard\r\nfor the king’s policy; but she kept up her court with spirit and dignity,\r\nbeing respected by her ladies, whom she treated well, and favorably\r\nregarded by the public, who were well disposed towards her for having\r\ngiven Brittany to France.  Some courtiers showed their astonishment that\r\nthe king should so patiently bear with a character so far from agreeable;\r\nbut “one must surely put up with something from a woman,” said Louis,\r\n“when she loves her honor and her husband.”  After a union of fifteen\r\nyears, Anne of Brittany died on the 9th of January, 1514, at the castle\r\nof Blois, nearly thirty-seven years old.  Louis was then fifty-two.  He\r\nseemed very much to regret his wife; but, some few months after her\r\ndeath, another marriage of policy was put, on his behalf, in course of\r\nnegotiation.  It was in connection with Princess Mary of England, sister\r\nof Henry VIII., with whom it was very important for Louis XII. and for\r\nFrance to be once more at peace and on good terms.  The Duke de\r\nLongueville, made prisoner by the English at the battle of Guinegate,\r\nhad, by his agreeable wit and his easy, chivalrous grace, won Henry\r\nVIII.’s favor in London; and he perceived that that prince, discontented\r\nwith his allies, the Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain, was\r\ndisposed to make peace with the King of France.  A few months, probably\r\nonly a few weeks, after Anne of Brittany’s death, De Longueville, no\r\ndoubt with Louis XII.’s privity, suggested to Henry VIII. the idea of a\r\nmarriage between his young sister and the King o France.  Henry liked to\r\ndo sudden and striking things: he gladly seized the opportunity of\r\navenging himself upon his two allies, who, in fact, had not been very\r\nfaithful to him, and he welcomed De Longueville’s idea.  Mary was\r\nsixteen, pretty, already betrothed to Archduke Charles of Austria, and,\r\nfurther passionately smitten with Charles Brandon, the favorite of Henry\r\nVIII., who had made him Duke of Suffolk, and, according to English\r\nhistorians, the handsomest nobleman in England.  These two difficulties\r\nwere surmounted: Mary herself formally declared her intention of breaking\r\na promise of marriage which had been made during her minority, and which\r\nEmperor Maximilian had shown himself in no hurry to get fulfilled; and\r\nLouis XII. formally demanded her hand.  Three treaties were concluded on\r\nthe 7th of August, 1514, between the Kings of France and England, in\r\norder to regulate the conditions of their political and matrimonial\r\nalliance; on the 13th of August, the Duke de Longueville, in his\r\nsovereign’s name, espoused the Princess Mary at Greenwich; and she,\r\nescorted to France by brilliant embassy, arrived on the 8th of October at\r\nAbbeville where Louis XII. was awaiting her.  Three days afterwards the\r\nmarriage was solemnized there in state, and Louis, who had suffered from\r\ngout during the ceremony, carried off his young queen to Paris, after\r\nhaving had her crowned at St. Denis Mary Tudor had given up the German\r\nprince, who was destined to become Charles V., but not the handsome\r\nEnglish nobleman she loved.  The Duke of Suffolk went to France to see\r\nher after her marriage, and in her train she had as maid of honor a young\r\ngirl, a beauty as well, who was one day to be Queen of England--Anne\r\nBoleyn.\r\n\r\nLess than three months after this marriage, on the 1st of January, 1515,\r\n“the death-bell-men were traversing the streets of Paris, ringing their\r\nbells and crying, ‘The good King Louis, father of the people, is dead.’”\r\n Louis XII., in fact, had died that very day, at midnight, from an attack\r\nof gout and a rapid decline.  “He had no great need to be married, for\r\nmany reasons,” says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard, “and he likewise had\r\nno great desire that way; but, because he found himself on every side at\r\nwar, which he could not maintain without pressing very hard upon his\r\npeople, he behaved like the pelican.  After that Queen Mary had made her\r\nentry, which was mighty triumphant, into Paris, and that there had taken\r\nplace many jousts and tourneys, which lasted more than six weeks, the\r\ngood king, because of his wife, changed all his manner of living: he had\r\nbeen wont to dine at eight, and he now dined at midday; he had been wont\r\nto go to bed at six in the evening, and he often now went to bed at\r\nmidnight.  He fell ill at the end of December, from the which illness\r\nnought could save him.  He was, whilst he lived, a good prince, wise and\r\nvirtuous, who maintained his people in peace, without pressing hard upon\r\nthem in any way, save by constraint.  He had in his time much of good and\r\nof evil, whereby he got ample knowledge of the world.  He obtained many\r\nvictories over his enemies; but towards the end of his days Fortune gave\r\nhim a little turn of her frowning face.  He was borne to his grave at St.\r\nDenis amongst his good predecessors, with great weeping and wailing, and\r\nto the great regret of his subjects.”\r\n\r\n“He was a gentle prince,” says Robert de la Marck, lord of Fleuranges,\r\n“both in war and otherwise, and in all matters wherein he was required to\r\ntake part.  It was pity when this malady of gout attacked him, for he was\r\nnot an old man.”\r\n\r\nTo the last of his days Louis XII.  was animated by earnest sympathy and\r\nactive solicitude for his people.  It cost him a great deal to make with\r\nthe King of England the treaties of August 7, 1514, to cede Tournai to the\r\nEnglish, and to agree to the payment to them of a hundred thousand crowns a\r\nyear for ten years.  He did it to restore peace to France, attacked on\r\nher own soil, and feeling her prosperity threatened.  For the same reason\r\nhe negotiated with Pope Leo X., Emperor Maximilian, and Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, and he had very nearly attained the same end by entering once\r\nmore upon pacific relations with them, when death came and struck him\r\ndown at the age of fifty-three.  He died sorrowing over the concessions\r\nhe had made from a patriotic sense of duty as much as from necessity, and\r\nfull of disquietude about the future.  He felt a sincere affection for\r\nFrancis de Valois, Count of Angouleme, his son-law and successor; the\r\nmarriage between his daughter Claude and that prince had been the chief\r\nand most difficult affair connected with his domestic life; and it was\r\nonly after the death of the queen, Anne of Brittany, that he had it\r\nproclaimed and celebrated.  The bravery, the brilliant parts, the amiable\r\ncharacter, and the easy grace of Francis I. delighted him, but he dreaded\r\nhis presumptuous inexperience, his reckless levity, and his ruinous\r\nextravagance; and in his anxiety as a king and father he said, “We are\r\nlaboring in vain; this big boy will spoil everything for us.”\r\n\r\nEND OF THE THIRD VOLUME.",
