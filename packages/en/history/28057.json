But mine must contain at\r\nleast an explanation, if only of omissions. The Highways and Byways of\r\nSurrey belong not to one county or to one period of time, but to two\r\ndifferent ages, and, to-day, to two counties. London has made the\r\ndifference. What was Surrey country a hundred years ago has been\r\ngathered into the network of London streets, and belongs, in the mind\r\nand on the map, to London. Almost for ten miles south of the London\r\nThames the old Surrey countryside has disappeared, and the disappearance\r\nhas left the writer of a book of Surrey Highways a difficult choice. It\r\nwould have been easy to fill a large part of the book with the Surrey of\r\nthe past, the Surrey of Southwark, and the great church of St. Mary\r\nOverie, and of Lambeth Palace and the Archbishops, of Vauxhall, and the\r\nParis Gardens, and the Bankside where Shakespeare brought out his plays.\r\nBut it is not easy to write anything new of any part of Surrey, and of\r\nthat part I could have written nothing new at all. So that it seemed\r\nbest to leave the Surrey that has disappeared to writers who have dealt\r\nwith its history far more adequately than I could, and to choose for the\r\nHighways and Byways of this book only those which still run through open\r\ncountry and through country villages and towns. That is the Surrey of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the book is simple. I have entered the county from\r\nthe west at Farnham, with the old Way along the chalk ridge, and I leave\r\nit by Titsey on the east. Of course, not all the Surrey villages belong\r\nto the ridge, though the chief towns lie along it. Other villages set\r\nthemselves along the banks of the two Surrey rivers, the Wey and the\r\nMole, and there are separate little groups like the villages of the Fold\r\ncountry, or on the plateaux of the Downs round Epsom, or between\r\nChertsey and Windsor on the Thames. These group themselves in their own\r\nchapters. But the main progress of the book is the trend of the great\r\nSurrey highway. As to following the book through its chapters from west\r\nto east, Surrey is threaded by such a net of railways that the\r\ndeliberate choosing of a route, with definite centres and points of\r\ndeparture, is unnecessary. But those who believe that the best way to\r\nsee any country is to walk through it will find that, as a general rule,\r\nthe book and its chapters are divided, sometimes naturally, sometimes\r\nperhaps a little perversely, into the compass of a day's walking. My own\r\nplan has been simple enough: it has been to set out in the morning and\r\nwalk till it was dark, and then take the train back to where I came\r\nfrom. Others will be able to plan far more comprehensive journeys by\r\nmotor-car, or by bicycling, or on horseback--though not many, perhaps,\r\nride horses by Surrey roads to-day. But only by walking would it be\r\npossible to explore much of the country. You would never, except by\r\nwalking, come at the meaning or read the story of the ancient Way, or\r\nthe Pilgrims' Road that follows it; only on foot can you climb the hills\r\nas you please, or follow the path where it chooses to take you. It is\r\nonly by walking that you will get to the best of the Thursley heather,\r\nor the Bagshot pines and gorse, or the whortleberries in the wind on\r\nLeith Hill, or the primroses of the Fold country, or the birds that call\r\nthrough the quiet of the Wey Canal--though there, too, you may take a\r\nboat; it is one of the prettiest of the byways. The walker through\r\nSurrey sees the best; the others see not much more than the road and\r\nwhat stands on the road.\r\n\r\nThe omission, or rather neglect, of Surrey in London is deliberate.\r\nThere must be many other omissions, I fear, which are not. For pointing\r\nout some of them, and for suggesting alterations and additions, I have\r\nto thank my friend Mr. Anthony Collett, who has kindly looked through my\r\nproofs. I should like also to be the first to thank Mr. Hugh Thomson for\r\nthe pleasure and the help of his charming sketches.\r\n\r\n     WEYBRIDGE, _October, 1908_           ERIC PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nI have made several additions to the second edition of this book, and, I\r\nhope, have corrected some mistakes.

   Tabard.\r\n\r\n\r\nEast and west through the county of Surrey runs the chalk ridge of the\r\nNorth Downs, the great highway of Southern England from the Straits of\r\nDover to Salisbury Plain. Of all English roads, it has carried the\r\nlongest pageant. It saw the beginnings of English history; for four\r\ncenturies it was one of the best known highways in Christendom: the\r\nvision from its windy heights is one of the widest and most gracious of\r\nall visions of woods and fields and hills. By the trackway they made\r\nupon the ridge came the worshippers to Stonehenge; Phoenician traders\r\nbrought bronze to barter for British tin, and the tin was carried in\r\ningots from Devon and Cornwall along the highway to the port of Thanet;\r\nGreeks and Gauls came for lead and tin and furs, and the merchants rode\r\nby the great Way to bring them. When Caesar swept through Surrey on his\r\nsecond landing, his legions marched over the Way before he turned north\r\nto the Thames. When the Conqueror drove fire and sword through Southern\r\nEngland, he went down to Winchester by the chalk ridge; and when the\r\ngreat lords under the Conqueror and Rufus, Richard de Tonebrige and\r\nWilliam de Warenne, built their rival castles, they built them to\r\ncommand the highway; so did Henry of Blois build his castle at Farnham;\r\nand so was Guildford Castle built. Of warfare later than Norman days,\r\nthe Way saw nearly all that went through Surrey. Simon de Montfort and\r\nhis barons rode fast by the ridge the year before Lewes; they lay at\r\nReading on the twenty-ninth of June, and on the first of July at\r\nReigate. In the wars of the Parliament, Farnham west of the Way saw the\r\nsiege of an hour; Lord Holland led his little band from Dorking to\r\nReigate and fled back again. Last of the echoes of Stuart battles,\r\nMonmouth, after Sedgmoor, was driven through Farnham to lodge for one\r\nnight of misery and fear at Abbot's Hospital in Guildford.\r\n\r\nBut the Way has another meaning and other memories. It is as the\r\nPilgrims' Way that it is best known, and as the Pilgrims' Way that it\r\nhas been written about and tracked and traced and surrounded with legend\r\nand story and the haunting melancholy of an old road once used and now\r\nhalf forgotten. The Pilgrims' Way is more than the old Way, for it runs\r\nby more than one road. The old Way took its followers along the ridge or\r\njust under it, high in the sun and wind where the traders and fighters\r\ncould see their route clear above the thick woods of the Weald. The\r\nPilgrims' Way lies as often on the low ground as on the hill. But it\r\nfollows the line of the chalk ridge, and the parallel roads, though here\r\nand there it would be difficult to choose between them as to which was\r\nmost used by travellers, have become vaguely named the Pilgrims' Way,\r\nand as the Pilgrims' Way they remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Along the Chalk Ridge.--Leith Hill in the Distance._]\r\n\r\nThe Way became the Pilgrims' Way in 1174, four years after Thomas a\r\nBecket was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral. His tomb in the Cathedral\r\nbecame the second shrine in Christendom, and pilgrims came to it along\r\nthe old trackway through Surrey, from Farnham east of the Hog's Back\r\nalong the hills to Canterbury in Kent. Henry the Second, one of the\r\nearliest pilgrims of all, made his act of repentance a few days after\r\nlanding at Southampton from France, on February 8, 1174. Or so legend\r\nrelates, and adds that he swore to walk barefoot; history is less\r\nprecise. After Henry the stream of devotees multiplied. Pilgrims\r\nlanded, like Henry, at Southampton, or between Southampton and\r\nChichester, and came through Winchester or Alton to Farnham; travellers\r\nfrom the West of England joined the foreigners at Winchester, or came to\r\nFarnham by the old Harrow Way, another ancient track from Salisbury\r\nPlain. Thousands made the journey; more and more followed year by year.\r\nAt last it was determined to divide the stream. St. Thomas was murdered\r\non December 29, and the great pilgrimage to Canterbury and the return\r\ncentred round that date. In 1220 pilgrims were given a chance of paying\r\ntheir vows in summer as well as winter. St. Thomas's body, on July 7,\r\nwas moved from the crypt under the nave to the grand altar in the nave,\r\nand from that day forward the Feast of the Translation took its share of\r\nthe pilgrims' numbers. A constant stream journeyed east and west;\r\ntravellers with vows unpaid met travellers returning from the shrine,\r\nand on and round the peopled highway sprang up booths and shelters to\r\nmeet the pilgrim's needs. Pedlars and merchants hawked their wares and\r\ndrove bargains by the road. Fairs were instituted in the villages along\r\nthe route; strolling musicians earned idle wages; beggars sat by the\r\nroadside, at the churchyard corners, at the foot of the hills, and asked\r\nfor alms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The \"Hog's Back.\"_]\r\n\r\nAnd here, before we follow the pilgrims across the county from Farnham\r\nto the lane by which they leave it east of Titsey, I want to make a\r\npoint clear. The pilgrims did not all travel to Canterbury by the same\r\nroad, along the selfsame track so many feet wide, as the Ordnance map\r\nand some of those who have written on the Pilgrims' Way would argue.\r\nThere is not one single, separate path along which every pilgrim who set\r\nout from Winchester to Canterbury travelled through Surrey. All that the\r\npilgrims did was to journey forward either on, or near, the old Way from\r\nwest to east and east to west, and it has happened that they used, more\r\nthan any other track besides the Way itself, one particular road. This\r\nroad can be followed parallel to the old Way for a long distance,\r\nrunning from church to church under the chalk ridge; and it is this road\r\nwhich is marked in the maps as the Pilgrims' Way. Perhaps that is\r\nconvenient, but it should be understood that not all the pilgrims went\r\nby it. For pilgrims, after all, were as human then as walkers along\r\ncountry roads are to-day. They would not all want to do the same thing\r\nin the same way. Some of them would set out to do one thing and some\r\nanother. Some would prefer to walk alone high up on the ridge; others\r\nwould choose a bevy of companions and chatter along the road under the\r\nhill. Some would be thin, ascetic persons, who liked to stride along and\r\nsee how far they could go without eating or drinking; some would be\r\npleasant, good-tempered creatures, who would amble by dusty places and\r\nbe thankful for cool beer; some would eat or drink mechanically, filled\r\nwith a single thought of prayer and pilgrimage to a shrine. Some would\r\nbe always perverse, and because most people travelled by one path, or\r\nhalted at an easy spot, would choose deliberately another path, and halt\r\nwhere others passed on. Some would determine, come what might of wind or\r\nrain or sun, to sleep at a certain village at nightfall; others would\r\nlet the weather decide for them. The weather would decide much, and it\r\nwould choose differently for different travellers. One of the writers\r\nwho has discussed the problems of the Pilgrims' Way suggests that the\r\nmain route would vary with varying degrees of heat and cold. If the\r\nweather were cold and wet, the pilgrims would travel on the chalk ridge;\r\nand if it were hot, they would go by the leafy woodland path below. But\r\nif I Were a pilgrim and the weather were hot, I should go by the top of\r\nthe ridge, so as to get the air and the view; probably I would go by the\r\nridge in any case, whatever the weather was.\r\n\r\nIf written proof were needed that the journeying pilgrims Were not\r\ncondemned to a sort of solemn observance of the rules of\r\n\"Follow-my-leader,\" or bound by uncomfortable routine like so many\r\nCook's tourists, it would not be difficult to find. From a paper on the\r\nPilgrims' Way, written by Major-General E. Renouard James, you may learn\r\nthat in 1463, nearly three hundred years after the first pilgrim\r\nfollowed Henry II to Canterbury, St. Martha's chapel by Guildford--St.\r\nMartha's being a corruption of \"The Martyr's,\" that is, St. Thomas the\r\nMartyr's chapel--was in need of repair. And so, through the Prior of\r\nNewark, \"forty days' indulgence was granted to such as should resort to\r\nthis chapel on account of devotion, prayer, pilgrimage, or offering; and\r\nshould there say Paternoster, the Angel's Salutation, and the Apostles'\r\nCreed; or should contribute, bequeath, or otherwise assign anything\r\ntowards the maintenance, repair, or rebuilding of the same.\" But what\r\ndoes that mean? It must mean that not all the pilgrims went into St.\r\nMartha's to pray, or even went by St. Martha's on their way east. The\r\nPrior specially framed the terms of his indulgence to attract more\r\npilgrims.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Hilaire Belloc's admirably interesting book _The Old Road_, in\r\nwhich he describes the way in which he, sometimes with one companion and\r\nsometimes with two, sought out the exact track of a single Pilgrims' Way\r\nfrom Winchester to Canterbury, I find him writing of the compulsions of\r\nthe pilgrimage--\"The pilgrim set out from Winchester: 'You must pass by\r\nthat well,' he heard, 'it is sacred.' ... 'You must, of ritual, climb\r\nthat isolated hill which you see against the sky. The spirits haunted it\r\nand were banished by the faith, and they say that martyrs died there.'\r\n... 'It is at the peril of the pilgrimage that you neglect this stone,\r\nwhose virtue saved our fathers and the great battle.' ... 'The church\r\nyou will next see upon your way is entered from the southern porch\r\nsunward by all truly devout men; such has been the custom here since\r\ncustom began.' From step to step the pilgrims were compelled to take the\r\noldest of paths.\" Well, some of the pilgrims, perhaps most of them,\r\nsince human nature imitates more often than it contradicts, may have\r\nbeen so compelled. But not all. I should like to set next to Mr.\r\nBelloc's passage a passage from the book of another pilgrim. Bunyan,\r\nwhen he wrote _Pilgrim's Progress_, may not have referred directly to\r\nthe Way from Winchester to Canterbury, though his 'Vanity Fair' has been\r\nguessed to correspond with Shalford Fair, and other details of the\r\nprogress have been fitted in with other happenings, as we shall see at\r\nShalford. But unquestionably he reproduces the state of mind with which\r\na pilgrim would undertake a journey, wherever his pilgrimage would take\r\nhim. He was born only ninety years after the last pilgrim had paid his\r\nvows; he would have talked to men whose fathers had made the pilgrimage,\r\nand as he writes of it the keynote is voluntary choosing of the road.\r\nHere is the passage:--\r\n\r\n\"I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot of the\r\nhill Difficulty, at the bottom of which was a spring. There were also in\r\nthe same place two other ways, besides that which came straight from the\r\ngate: one turned to the left hand, and the other to the right, at the\r\nbottom of the hill; but the narrow way lay right up the hill; and the\r\nname of that going up the side of the hill, is called Difficulty.\r\nChristian now went to the spring and drank thereof to refresh himself,\r\nand then began to go up the hill, saying--\r\n\r\n    'The hill, though high, I covet to ascend;\r\n    The difficulty will not me offend;\r\n    For I perceive the way to life lies here.\r\n    Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor fear,\r\n    Better, though difficult, the right way to go,\r\n    Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.\r\n\r\nThe other two also came to the foot of the hill. But, when they saw that\r\nthe hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways to go;\r\nand supposing also that these two ways might meet again with that up\r\nwhich Christian went, on the other side of the hill; therefore, they\r\nwere resolved to go in those ways. Now the name of one of those ways was\r\nDanger, and the name of the other Destruction. So the one took the way\r\nwhich is called Danger, which led him into a great wood; and the other,\r\ntook directly up the way to Destruction, which led him into a wide\r\nfield, full of dark mountains, where he stumbled and fell, and rose no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nNow that is exactly the way in which the pilgrims might have separated\r\nand gone their own ways at a dozen places along the road to Canterbury.\r\nTake, to begin with, the joining and the parting of the ways at Farnham.\r\nPilgrims would meet there, as we have seen, coming through Winchester,\r\nfrom Normandy, or by the Harrow Way from Salisbury Plain, from Wales,\r\nfrom Ireland, and all the West of England. But they would not all\r\nnecessarily leave by the road that runs straight from Farnham to the\r\nfoot of the Hog's Back. Some would have letters to the Abbot of\r\nWaverley, would spend a night at the Abbey two miles to the south-east,\r\nand join the others perhaps at Puttenham, six miles further along the\r\nWay. Then, among those who chose to travel straight to the western slope\r\nof the Hog's Back, there would be different minds at the foot of the\r\nhill. Some would climb the hill at Whitewaysend--the white way of the\r\nchalk would begin for them there--and would stride along in the sunlight\r\nthe seven straight miles to Guildford. Others would prefer to keep to a\r\npath under the hill, stopping at the churches and gossiping at the inns.\r\nYou can trace the old road clearly through Seale to Puttenham, where it\r\nmust have travelled south of the church door, instead of taking the\r\nawkward and unnecessary turn to the north which is taken by the modern\r\nroad. Then at Puttenham the pilgrims would divide again. Some would\r\njourney straight on across Puttenham Heath, heading towards St.\r\nCatherine's Hill--you can see the rough track; others would turn aside\r\nto the south-east, to visit Compton church; perhaps they would come down\r\ninto Compton as you may come down into it from the east to-day, by what\r\nis evidently an old track cut deep in the woods. They would go up north\r\nagain from Compton; perhaps they would be tired of the valley, and would\r\nclimb the Hog's Back to walk the last mile or so into Guildford in the\r\nwind; perhaps they would join the other stream of pilgrims travelling by\r\nthe sandy lane by which you may walk to-day as slowly as they did\r\ntowards St. Catherine's Hill. Most of them, I think, would collect on\r\nSt. Catherine's Hill; St. Catherine's was more popular than the\r\nGuildford churches. So General James has discovered, examining ancient\r\nrecords of litigation. The parson of St. Nicholas, Guildford, fearing to\r\nlose his profit from the pilgrims who visited the town, purchased from\r\nthe lord of the manor the freehold of the site of the chapel, and\r\nrebuilt it in 1317. Perhaps the attraction of St. Catherine's was that\r\nit was on the way to Shalford Fair. Guildford had two special fairs, on\r\nMay 4 and November 22, to catch the summer and the winter pilgrims. But\r\nShalford Fair was the great fair, and actually covered 140 acres of\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coming in to Puttenham._]\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims would cross the Wey under St. Catherine's Hill by a ferry\r\nor a rough plank bridge. The merchants travelling with their horses, and\r\nthe ponies driven from Weyhill Fair out towards Salisbury Plain, would\r\ncome through the water by a ford. But the ferry and the bridge were both\r\nof almost immemorial antiquity. In 1736 there was a dispute about the\r\nbridge. The lord of the manor of Braboeuf had built a bridge over the\r\nWey for a fair on St. Matthew's Day. The owner of the church lands at\r\nShalford ordered it to be destroyed; he claimed the right of conveying\r\npassengers over the river. They went to law, and it was alleged that\r\nthere had been a bridge there time out of record. Judgment, however,\r\ndecided \"that there had been no bridge except _per unum battellum_ (one\r\nplank) at the mill belonging to the heirs of Henry de la Poyle (a mile\r\nlower), laid for convenience of the pilgrims going to the chapel of St.\r\nKatherine at the time of the fair.\" General James has unearthed the\r\ndecision of the Court, and incidentally added another bypath to the\r\nPilgrims' Way.\r\n\r\nOpposite the ferry under St. Catherine's the line of the Way to St.\r\nMartha's is clear enough, a green track in a green field; and once I saw\r\nit as the pilgrims may have seen it on a spring morning. It was in May,\r\nand there was a haze over the meadowland by the river which blurred\r\nshapes and colours. St. Catherine's was no longer a ruin; the buildings\r\non the hill faded into the trees; the clothes of wanderers by the\r\nriverside took on mediaeval brightnesses, lost modern forms; and into the\r\nforeground ran three bare-headed, yellow-haired children, and in their\r\nbrown arms great bunches of cuckoo-flowers. So might one returning from\r\nthe Martyr's chapel have seen the path to the ferry in the days when the\r\nClerk told the tale of Griselda.\r\n\r\nThe track crosses the road near the ferry, and by a wood named the\r\nChantries comes up to St. Martha's, at the foot of the hill a\r\nclose-cropped aisle of down grass, and nearer the top a loose, sandy\r\npath among pines. At the base of the hill the pilgrims who had come by\r\nthe ferry would be joined by those who had left Guildford by Pewley\r\nHill, to come out through the valley past Tytings, now a private\r\nresidence, but once the dwelling of St. Martha's priest. And on the\r\nother side of the hill a difficulty waits. Mr. Belloc traces the road\r\nfrom the foot across a ploughed field, to connect with a narrow lane on\r\nthe other side of the road dropping from Newlands Corner to Albury.\r\nWell, it is possible that some of the pilgrims strayed out in that\r\ndirection, though it means that they would have to descend a bank like\r\nthe wall of a house by the Newlands Corner road, which is a sunken\r\ntrack; also, Mr. Belloc owns that a little further on this road he\r\nchooses has a doubtful section of a mile and a half. May he not be on\r\nthe wrong road? Why should not the pilgrims drop down the road which\r\nleads from the foot of St. Martha's Hill into Albury? The inns would\r\nhave tempted them; they would be heading straight for the church; and\r\nthe road leading to inns and church is clearly a road that led from St.\r\nMartha's Hill into the valley of the Tillingbourne long before the hill\r\nbore a Christian chapel. It is evidently an old British trackway. It\r\nruns along a ridge, and yet it is sunk deep between two very high banks.\r\nIf it was there when the pilgrims came down from the Martyr's chapel,\r\nwhy should they make a fresh track for themselves, especially one which,\r\nas Mr. Belloc admits, \"raises a difficulty unique in the whole course of\r\nthe way\"? The track he follows goes by the wet, northward side of a\r\nhill--\"an exception to an otherwise universal rule.\"\r\n\r\nI have no space to follow the way in detail through the country, but\r\nthis particular section seemed to me to illustrate clearly the need for\r\nimagining what the pilgrims would be likely to do, rather than to try to\r\nfit in their doings with a particular path or lane through Albury. I do\r\nnot see why the pilgrims should not have followed the same route as we\r\ntravel by to-day. Doubtless by what is now Albury Park the road has\r\nbecome confused. May it not have led through Albury Park past the south\r\nporch of the ruined church, and so come in a natural way to Shere church\r\nby the old inn? All five would then lie in a line--the old track from\r\nthe Martyr's chapel, Albury Church, the White Horse Inn, the short road\r\nto Shere Church, and the track that leads up from Gomshall to the flank\r\nof the downs again. But that is only guessing; the line on the maps\r\ntempts it.\r\n\r\nEast of Gomshall to Oxted almost on the county border the track of the\r\nold Way and of the Pilgrims' Ways, sometimes coinciding, sometimes\r\nrunning parallel to each other, runs along the crest and the southern\r\nslopes of the chalk ridge. Yews and wind-bent thorn mark the ways,\r\nsometimes, as east of Gomshall, by a clear cut ridge in the hill, lined\r\nwith ancient trees; sometimes, as under Denbies by Dorking, you can only\r\npick out the path by solitary yews studding grass fields and corn-land.\r\nAt the gap of the Mole by Dorking the old Way, perhaps, forded the Mole;\r\nthe pilgrims would cross by Burford Bridge, which joins the Roman Ermyn\r\nStreet to Stane Street beyond Dorking. Both the Way and the pilgrims'\r\ntrack would join on the line of yews on Box Hill, and from Box Hill to\r\nReigate there is a succession of yew road-marks and hedges, with here\r\nand there the whole face of the downs bitten out by a chalk pit;\r\ngradually the road climbs, until the track above Reigate lies almost on\r\nthe highest point of the ridge. At Reigate the old Way carries on,\r\ncrossing the hill-road which was from the town north to London. The\r\nslope of the modern road has been eased by cutting into the hill, and\r\nthe ancient Way now is joined, on Reigate Hill, by a suspension bridge.\r\n\r\nBut the pilgrims would drop down into the town to sleep and to eat and\r\ndrink. You may see their tracks on the chalk, streaming down from the\r\nridge like a bunch of white ribands in the wind. They came into Reigate\r\nby Slipshoe Lane, and there, where the cross roads meet, they stood to\r\npray at St. Thomas's shrine, now no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By Slipshoe Lane to the Red Cross Inn, Reigate._]\r\n\r\nThey would please themselves where they climbed the ridge again. Or they\r\njoined the old Way, perhaps, in what is now Gatton Park, where the yews\r\npoint to Merstham church. After Merstham the tracks divide again. East\r\nof an interrupting chalk pit, a thick yew hedge lines the side of the\r\nhill, under which I once ate fine blackberries in December, as perhaps\r\nthe Wife of Bath ate them. But half way along the ridge of yews another\r\npath climbs up a plough, and on the crest it joins a narrow lane which\r\nis as much the Pilgrims' Way as any road on the downs; it runs by\r\nTollsworth Farm over the summit of White Hill, and is actually marked\r\n\"The Pilgrims' Way\" twice on the sign posts, so sure are the local\r\npainters of what they have to point out. East from White Hill you may\r\nfollow a single track, sometimes grass, sometimes modern road. There is\r\na puzzle at Godstone Quarry, where the chalk pits have cut the hill to\r\npieces, and the tiny path which perhaps still keeps the line across the\r\npits is a perilous slippery place in the rain. On the far side of\r\nto-day's road by the chalk pit you may pick up the green track again,\r\nthough you will lose it rounding the spur of the hill that lies half way\r\nbetween Godstone and the railway. The old Way probably still kept to the\r\nridge, and Sir Gilbert Scott thought he had traced the Pilgrims' Way\r\nthrough the Hanging Wood north of Tandridge Hill Lane. But I think I\r\nfound it in a green track which runs westward from a gap in that same\r\nlane. It looked like a rough cart-track through a field, and would join\r\nthe road already traced beyond. In its centre, a foot from the ground,\r\nwas placed, and doubtless remains, a blue enamelled notice board, with\r\nthe brief but usual caution to trespassers.\r\n\r\nEast of Tandridge Hill Lane, on the far side of a grass field, a curious\r\npath, half ditch, half avenue of yews and thorns, leads down through\r\nwoodland to green trackway again. The green track crosses the railway\r\ncutting, and so journeys on into Titsey Park on the level lowland. Under\r\nthe new Titsey church it runs, as it once ran past the old church in the\r\nPark, and from Titsey church eastward, by a country lane through broad\r\nand glorious cornfields, it passes out of Surrey into Kent.\r\n\r\nBy those ways they went, fur-clad Briton, ravaging Dane, Roman eagle,\r\ntraders of tin and drivers of ponies, along the ridge in the sun and the\r\nwind and the rain; by their side and after them, along the ridge and\r\nunder it, travelled the knight and the clerk and the friar and the\r\nsummoner, as they travelled from the Tabard Inn to St. Thomas's shrine\r\nwith Chaucer; and we may follow them, beginning with Surrey's western\r\ntown, and journeying at the end from the Tabard again, with the pilgrims\r\npassing to the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFARNHAM\r\n\r\n    The joining of the ways.--Georgian poke bonnets.--The Castle.--Kings\r\n    at Farnham.--Poet Soldiers.--A glorious battle.--The Bishop's\r\n    artillery.--Paradise and the Bull's Eye.--Izaak Walton.--Cobbett's\r\n    education.--An old alehouse.--Hopgrowers in difficulties.--King\r\n    Charles's cap.--Elmer's pheasants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWesternmost of all Surrey towns, Farnham stands at the joining of the\r\nways. Traders from Cornwall, pilgrims from Winchester, horse-dealers\r\ndriving their ponies from Weyhill Fair, have met on the roads that run\r\ninto Farnham from the west and south and north. Farnham Castle, for\r\nseven centuries a Bishop's palace, links Surrey to the See of\r\nWinchester. The Farnham oasthouses and hop-grounds bridge the crossing\r\nfrom the fertile Hampshire border to the Bagshot sands and the wild and\r\nsterile moors of Frensham and Hindhead. The town, set in its cultured\r\nplot of vines and flower-beds, with its historic castle, its tranquil\r\nchurch, and the Wey watering the pastures under its walls, stands like a\r\ngarden between the military rigidity of Aldershot and the wind that\r\nblows over the Thursley heather.\r\n\r\nNo town in Surrey has two such old and orderly main streets as Farnham.\r\nHere and there modern taste for a noisy pattern has broken the quiet\r\nlevel; a bank has piled up a huge building of timber, handsome but out\r\nof keeping; the new Corn Exchange is out of keeping and hideous; and in\r\n1866 municipal enterprise pulled down the old market house, which stood\r\nat the junction of the main streets and was a fascinating little\r\nbuilding perched on pillars. But much that is ancient and simple in\r\nsquare red brick remains. The plain, low-roofed houses, with their flat\r\nfacades and crumpled, lichened tiles, succeed one another down Castle\r\nStreet and West Street with a delightful monotony. The elaborate carved\r\nand painted doorways, knockers, lunettes, doors and steps are quite a\r\nmodel exhibition. The two streets wear a Georgian air of poke-bonnets\r\nand long purse-strings. Or they are Georgian, at all events, once or\r\ntwice during the day; on a sunny morning before breakfast, perhaps, or\r\nwhen, perhaps in the rain, the endless traffic of wheels quiets for an\r\nhour. For Farnham stands on the high road from London, and the motor\r\ncars chase the eighteenth century into the side-streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Looking towards Farnham from Thursley Common._]\r\n\r\nFarnham is mostly of one period, and searchers for very old architecture\r\nwill be disappointed. One of the oldest buildings in the town is a tiny\r\nset of almshouses, whose lowly gables line the road under the castle\r\nhill. They were built by Andrew Windsor, of the parish of Bentley in\r\nHampshire, in 1619, and were intended, as an inscription on the wall\r\ninforms you, \"For the Habitation and Relief of eight poor Honest\r\nImpotent Old Persons.\" Even with four epithets, the almoners seem to\r\nfind life supportable.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and the oldest building is, of course, the castle. It\r\nstands nobly on a hill, towards which the street rises like a carriage\r\ndrive, ending in a flight of steps. Once it must have dominated the town\r\nas a fortress, but since Cromwell broke down the keep, Farnham has\r\nlooked up at a quieter and more episcopal pile--a fine gateway tower,\r\nbuilt by Bishop Fox early in the sixteenth century. Much of the castle\r\nstands as he rebuilt it after various misfortunes in baronial and other\r\nwars, but the front as it looks down on Farnham is less severe. Two\r\nimposing cedar trees, out of a group of several, break the line of Fox's\r\nmassive red brick. Local legend has aged them considerably, for two\r\nhundred years is suggested as a modest estimate of their antiquity. As a\r\nfact, they cannot be much more than one hundred years old. They were\r\nplanted by Mrs. North, wife of Bishop North, who held the See from 1781\r\nto 1820, and in an engraving of the castle published in 1792 there is\r\nnot a sign of them. The cedar is a very fast-growing tree--one of the\r\nreasons why it is so brittle. The Farnham cedars are as brittle as any\r\nothers. I was told that when the present Bishop went abroad early in the\r\nyear 1908, he was hesitating over cutting off some of the larger\r\nbranches which shaded the castle wall and would not let it dry. The\r\nApril snow settled the question for him, and broke the branches he had\r\nthought of lopping.\r\n\r\nFarnham Castle has entertained many Kings, from Edward I to Queen\r\nVictoria. One of its earliest bishops was a king's brother, the great\r\nHenry of Blois. Elizabeth was often at the castle, and once, bidding the\r\nDuke of Norfolk dine with her there, spoke to him of his intrigue to\r\nmarry Mary Queen of Scots. According to one story she warned him \"to be\r\ncareful on what pillow he laid his head\"; according to another, the Duke\r\nassured the Queen that the intrigue was none of his making, and that \"he\r\nmeant never to marry with such a person where he could not be sure of\r\nhis pillow.\" He was thinking of Darnley, and that dark February morning\r\nwith the King stretched dead on the garden grass.\r\n\r\nJames I hunted at Farnham regularly, and actually took a lease from\r\nBishop Bilson of the castle, which he found a convenient centre for\r\nhunting in the Surrey bailiwick of Windsor Forest. But James was the\r\nlast of the kings to hunt from Farnham. George III and Queen Charlotte\r\nvisited the castle because Bishop Thomas had been the King's tutor, but\r\nFarnham's entertaining of royalty was nearly at an end. Once, in the\r\nlast century, Queen Victoria rode there from Aldershot with the Prince\r\nConsort, inspected the Bible on which she had taken her oath at the\r\nCoronation, admired the castle, and rode back again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Farnham Castle from the High Street._]\r\n\r\nA castle with a keep and a moat, or rather a deep dry ditch, ought to\r\nhave memories of fighting, and Farnham Castle has seen some sharp\r\nskirmishing. It has the distinction of having been twice held by a poet,\r\nonce for the Parliament and once for the King. George Wither was its\r\nfirst commander, and his command did not increase his reputation either\r\nas a man of letters or a man of war. Probably the castle was never worth\r\ndefending. It was isolated, and its possession, as it turned out, would\r\nhave helped neither side to control the movements of the other. But\r\nWither thought otherwise. He had made his name as a pastoral poet,\r\nauthor of _Fidelia_ and _The Shepherd's Hunting_ and he now proposed to\r\nmake another name as a brilliant soldier. He saw all sorts of\r\npossibilities in Farnham Castle and when the war broke out and he was\r\nmade Governor, he began at once building a drawbridge and a sallyport,\r\ndigging a well, and storing provisions. Unfortunately he had no\r\nartillery, without which no self-respecting soldier could be expected to\r\nhold a fort, even where, as at Farnham, there was no enemy within shot.\r\nRiding up to London, he poured a perfect shower of requests into the\r\nunwilling ears of Sir Richard Onslow, who was the chief pillar of the\r\nParliamentary party in Surrey, and at last he got an order for some\r\ndemi-culverins from the Tower. But his hopes were still to be dashed.\r\nThe next day came news that Prince Rupert was already in North Surrey,\r\nand the demi-culverins were counter-ordered for fear of capture. Then\r\nmight he have light guns, drakes or falconets, which he could take along\r\nby-roads? Sir Richard's answer was that the fortress, since it could not\r\nbe held, must be abandoned. For this decision Wither afterwards attacked\r\nSir Richard Onslow as a traitor, in two tremendous effusions entitled\r\n_Se Defendendo_ and _Justitiarius Justificatus_, of which the latter\r\nlanded him in prison and was burnt by the common hangman. Meanwhile,\r\nstill protesting at being refused his guns, he rode down to his own\r\nhouse at Alton, collected what carts and cattle he could find, took them\r\ninto Farnham, brought out all the stores and men he could command\r\nthrough Farnham Park, and got them all safely to Kingston. He might have\r\nbeen captured by Rupert; it was really quite an exploit.\r\n\r\nSo the castle came to the Royalists. They put in command of it Sir John\r\nDenham, who in that very same year had published, anonymously, his\r\nfamous _Cooper's Hill_. Wither had left behind him three hundred sheep\r\nand a hundred oxen, so that the garrison was well victualled, and the\r\npoet-Governor ought to have been able to put up a fight against an enemy\r\nwho had no artillery. Wither would have shown him how to do it. But Sir\r\nJohn had no idea of what a battle should be. One December morning, a few\r\ndays after he had taken over the command, Sir William Waller, a\r\nParliament General, rode up at the head of his dragoons and demanded\r\nsurrender. Of course Sir John refused, and Sir William proceeded to fix\r\na petard to the gate, to blow it in. A military genius like Wither would\r\nhave ordered his men to fire their muskets at the enemy; but all the\r\nsoldiers on both sides escaped that day. The explosive was securely\r\nfastened in position, the gate was shattered, the assailants rushed at\r\nthe breach, and began at once to pull down the barricade of timber\r\nerected inside by the garrison. This done, the garrison surrendered, and\r\nthe glorious day was over.\r\n\r\nBut Sir John Denham got the best of Wither in the end. Not long\r\nafterwards Wither was taken prisoner by the Royalists, and Denham, who\r\nhad wisely been set at liberty to rejoin the Royalist forces, begged for\r\nhis rival's life. Mr. Wither, he pleaded, should not be hanged, for\r\nwhile Wither lived he was not himself the worst poet in England.\r\n\r\nThe castle keep was never to be held by a successor to Wither and\r\nDenham. Sir William Waller blew up one of the walls when he took it from\r\nSir John, and the year before Charles was executed Parliament ordered it\r\nto be dismantled altogether. The garrison fell to with enthusiasm,\r\nstripped the building of all the lead, wood, and glass they could lay\r\ntheir hands on, and sold the wreck to make up their back pay. At the\r\nRestoration, when Bishop Duppa came to the See, he found the castle\r\nalmost uninhabitable. It cost him more than two thousand pounds to make\r\nit fit to live in, and his successor, Bishop Morley, spent even more. He\r\nactually laid out ten thousand pounds in improvements, only to meet with\r\nJohn Aubrey's criticism that he had repaired the building \"without any\r\nregard to the rules of architecture.\" Doctor Peter Mew, who succeeded\r\nMorley, set about improving the castle from outside, and planted the top\r\nof the keep, into which the old walls had been tumbled, with fruit\r\ntrees. Bishop Sumner, who held the See for forty-two years from 1827,\r\nturned the orchard into a garden.\r\n\r\nBishop Mew had a double record. He was a soldier as well as a prelate,\r\nand he took part in the last battle fought on English soil. When King\r\nMonmouth's Mendip miners were making their last stand at Sedgmoor, the\r\nend of the fight came with the arrival of King James's artillery. The\r\nheavy cannon might never have been drawn to the ground where the battle\r\nwas raging, for the artillery were unprovided with horses, had not the\r\nBishop offered his coach horses and traces. When they came to Sedgmoor,\r\nhe himself directed the fire.\r\n\r\nThe result of the various fortunes and misfortunes of the castle in war,\r\nand of the different additions and alterations made by successive\r\nBishops, is naturally rather puzzling. The castle is a medley of the\r\nbuilding of eight centuries. Oldest of all is the ruined keep and the\r\nframework, or foundations, of the castle buildings; the masonry of the\r\nkeep is the work of Henry of Blois, and belongs to the twelfth century.\r\nNext come three pillars of the old chapel, now used as a servants' hall.\r\nI saw it when it was set for a meal, and the severe cleanliness of the\r\nwhite stone above the white tablecloth and glass and cutlery has\r\nremained one of the distinctest of my memories of the castle. Next in\r\nage is the outer gateway--doubtless the scene of Sir William Waller's\r\nexplosion--an imposing block of masonry. From each side of the gateway\r\nruns the outer wall of the castle, and between the keep and the outer\r\nwall what was once a ditch has grown into the Bishop's garden, a sloping\r\nstretch of shaven lawn and flower borders, with a fountain and birds\r\nbathing in it. The keep itself, almost from the broken parapet to the\r\ntumbled stones at the base, is a mixture of wall and rock garden, in\r\nwhich grow all the rock plants worth growing. Perhaps there were\r\nwallflowers when Bishop Mew planted his orchard in the keep; but the\r\npasque flower and other rarer blossoms which crowd round the base belong\r\nto the gardening of a later day. The level lawn and flower beds of the\r\ninner garden of the keep are as serene and shining as those below, and\r\nthe view to the south over Hindhead and the south downs is finer and\r\nfreer than from anywhere in the grounds, though there are many fine\r\nviews from the castle windows. Fanny Burney, who visited Farnham in\r\n1791, only a month released from the trammels of Court life, would\r\ncertainly have been able, as she tells us she wished, to see the hills\r\nabove her beloved Norbury. But ladies of the Court were delicate\r\ncreatures, and she could not climb to the top. \"I was ready to fall\r\nalready, from only ascending the slope to reach the castle,\" she adds\r\nwith some humility.\r\n\r\nOf all the bishops, Bishop Fox left the most enduring mark on the\r\ncastle. He built the noble and lofty gateway tower named after him, and\r\ncertainly altered the look of the castle as Farnham sees it to-day, more\r\nthan any other Bishop, though what it may have looked like when the\r\nboundary walls were all landing can only be guessed. Within, one of the\r\nchief restorers was Bishop Morley. The hall, before he made his\r\nalterations, was a good deal larger than the present room; you can see\r\nthe old doorway in the wall of the wide entrance passage. He added the\r\nsplendid staircases, with their carved oak newels, the work of Grinling\r\nGibbons; and he built the chapel, which also has some fine carving. A\r\nlater and most princely Bishop, Anthony Thorold, who held the See from\r\n1891 to 1895, laid down a mile and a hundred yards of stair carpet, and\r\nrepaired an acre and a fifth of roof. He also fitted up rooms for\r\nordination candidates, each room with a name. St. Francis and other\r\nsaints preside over the slumbers of some; some sleep in Paradise; a\r\nBishop who is an occasional visitor looks out upon the Castle garden\r\nfrom the Bull's Eye.\r\n\r\nBishop Morley, who spent so much money on the Castle, spent very little\r\non himself. A tiny room, almost a cell, is shown as the chamber in which\r\nhe spent hours in prayer, and in the extreme corner is a stone couch, on\r\nwhich he slept when he allowed himself sleep. He had but one full meal a\r\nday, he never warmed himself at a fire, he never married, he was never\r\nill, and was found dead on his bed one morning, at the ripe age of\r\neighty-seven. Starved to death, you are told; the hint is almost of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nIzaak Walton knew Morley, and stayed with him at the castle. He wrote\r\nhis Lives of Hooker and Herbert under the Bishop's roof, possibly added\r\nsomething to his Life of Donne; the room is shown. I like to think of\r\nhim sitting through a sunny morning writing gently about the\r\nshortcomings of Mrs. Hooker, how she made her poor husband tend the\r\nsheep and rock the cradle; or setting down the superb last sentences of\r\nthe Life, and then taking down his fishing rod and wandering down by the\r\nWey after trout and chub. Perhaps, indeed, he could get a salmon. Among\r\nthe dues collected by the Bailiffs of the Borough early in the\r\nseventeenth century I find the following----\r\n\r\n    \"Of every fishmonger that selleth ffish at his window in the lent to\r\n    paye at good ffriday a good lb. of samon or of the beast ffish they\r\n    have then leaft.\"\r\n\r\nThe salmon, presumably, swam with the other \"beast ffish\" in the Wey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cobbett's Birthplace at Farnham._]\r\n\r\nFarnham's greatest man was not an ecclesiastic, but a politician.\r\nWilliam Cobbett, soldier, farmer, Radical, editor of _Peter Porcupine_\r\nand the _Weekly Political Register_, and author of a diary unequalled of\r\nits kind in English writing, was born at Farnham on March 9, 1762. The\r\nhouse in which he was born, once a farmhouse and now the Jolly Farmer\r\ninn, stands on the outskirts of the town near the Wey, conspicuous with\r\na white gable. As a boy, he must have been one of the busiest on any\r\nfarm in the neighbourhood. His father used to boast that he had four\r\nboys, of whom the eldest was only fifteen years old--William Cobbett was\r\nthe third--and yet that they would do as much work as any three men in\r\nFarnham. \"When I first trudged a field,\" you read in the _The Life of\r\nWilliam Cobbett, by Himself_, \"with my satchel swung over my shoulder, I\r\nwas hardly able to climb the gates and stiles, and at the close of day,\r\nto reach home was a task of infinite difficulty.\" He was taught the\r\nbeginnings of farming at Farnham, and he first ran away from Farnham to\r\nbe a gardener. He was employed as a boy in the castle grounds, and there\r\nhe met a man who was a gardener at Kew. They talked, and the\r\neleven-year-old boy was fired to see for himself what gardening could\r\nbe. Next day he started off, with sixpence-halfpenny in his pocket, and\r\nwalked all day till he came to Richmond. There he should have had\r\nsupper; he had threepence left to get it with. But threepence was\r\nexactly the price of a little book, _The Tale of a Tub_, which he spied\r\nin a bookseller's window. He bought it, took it into a field near Kew\r\nGardens, and sat down to read; read on till it was dark, tumbled to\r\nsleep under a haystack, and woke to ask the head gardener for work. He\r\nwas given work, but the gardener persuaded him to return home. Ten years\r\nlater he ran away from Farnham again, and for the last time. He was out\r\non the road to meet some friends on the way to Guildford Fair; the\r\nLondon coach swung by, he swung up behind, and by nine that night was in\r\nLondon with half-a-crown in his pocket. He left London for a soldier,\r\nand his Farnham boyhood was over.\r\n\r\nRiding by Farnham forty years after, Cobbett showed his son the spot\r\nwhere he received his education. It was easily come by, but he was of\r\nopinion that if he had not had it, \"if I had been brought up a milksop,\r\nwith a nurserymaid everlastingly at my heels, I should have been this\r\nday as great a fool, as inefficient a mortal, as any of those frivolous\r\nidiots that are turned out from Winchester and Westminster School, or\r\nfrom any of those dens of dunces called Colleges and Universities.\" The\r\nspot is a sandy bank above the Bourne, a little stream, dry in summer,\r\nwhich runs a mile south of Farnham, from Holt Forest to the Wey. This is\r\nthe education, described in _Rural Rides_:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is a little hop-garden in which I used to work when from\r\n    eight to ten years old; from which I have scores of times run to\r\n    follow the hounds, leaving the hoe to do the best that it could to\r\n    destroy the weeds; but the most interesting thing was a _sand-hill_,\r\n    which goes from a part of the heath down to the rivulet. As a due\r\n    mixture of pleasure with toil, I, with two brothers, used\r\n    occasionally to _disport_ ourselves, as the lawyers call it, at this\r\n    sand-hill. Our diversion was this: we used to go to the top of the\r\n    hill, which was steeper than the roof of a house; one used to draw\r\n    his arms out of the sleeves of his smock-frock, and lay himself down\r\n    with his arms by his sides; and then the others, one at head, and\r\n    the other at feet, sent him rolling down the hill like a barrel or a\r\n    log of wood. By the time he got to the bottom, his hair, eyes, ears,\r\n    nose, and mouth were all full of this loose sand; then the others\r\n    took their turn, and at every roll there was a monstrous spell of\r\n    laughter.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weydon Mill, Farnham._]\r\n\r\nWhen will _Rural Rides_ be added to the cheap editions? No other book\r\nof the open air and open politics mixes the two with such a breezy grip\r\nas Cobbett's. One rides with the sturdy old man over the road which he\r\nthought the prettiest in England--the four miles between Guildford and\r\nGodalming--or across \"the most villainous spot God ever made,\" which was\r\nHindhead, and listens to him praising the bean fields and the turnips\r\nhere, and the oaks and acacias there, cursing the Wen-devils and\r\nplace-men and pensioners, the reptiles, toad-eaters and tax-eaters, and\r\nyet the sheer honesty and affection of the man shine from every page.\r\nThere never was such a mixture of execration and the scent of\r\nbean-blossom. But _Rural Rides_ remains a book of the library rather\r\nthan the bookshelf.\r\n\r\nFarnham has two other authors, one a native and one a friend. Miss Ada\r\nBayly, known to her readers as Edna Lyall, made Farnham her holiday home\r\nsince she was four years old, and set the scenes of two of her novels in\r\nthe town. Even better known by his work, if not by his name, is Augustus\r\nToplady, the author of the hymn, \"Rock of Ages.\" Toplady was born in a\r\nlittle house in West Street, now pulled down, in 1740. He wrote much\r\nthat was bitter; all that is remembered is his hymn.\r\n\r\nEvery town on the Portsmouth road has its old coaching inn, and\r\nFarnham's is the Bush. It stands modestly aloof; you must walk under an\r\narch to finds its oldest walls and its wistaria. It was not always the\r\nbest inn in Farnham. In 1604, in the account of the Borough, the\r\nreceipts of the Bailiffs are thus recorded:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dewes which hath bene payed accostomly paied to the Baylleffs of\r\n    the Borrough and Towne of Farneham, beyond the memory of any man\r\n    that now liveth as Aniale rents always as followeth:--\r\n\r\n    For the 4 Inns                               28s\r\n    That to saye of the Georg                     7s\r\n        of the Whit Hart                          7s\r\n        of the Anteolop                           7s\r\n        of the Crown                              7s\r\n    Of every alhouse within the Borough           2s\r\n    Of every alhouse out of the Borough          12d\r\n    Of every alhouse at the chosing of the\r\n      Bayleffs, called knowledge money            1d\r\n    Of every alhouse as will unlisensed or\r\n      licinsed at every ffayr day every\r\n      on of them                                  1d.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bush is not mentioned by name; it was a mere alehouse. Soon it\r\nbecame a full-grown inn, and the Georg, the Whit Hart and the Anteolop\r\npaled their ineffectual hearths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oasthouses near Farnham._]\r\n\r\nFarnham was once the greatest market in England for wheat. Now the chief\r\nindustry is hops. Farnham hops are some of the best grown, and have\r\nalways fetched long prices. In Cobbett's day, Kentish hops averaged five\r\npounds a hundredweight, and Hampshire hops were about the same price;\r\nFarnham hops fetched seven pounds. English hops to-day average perhaps\r\nless than five pounds a hundred, and the hopgrower is in distress.\r\nEighty years ago he was being ruined. Cobbett makes up his accounts,\r\nwriting at Chilworth on Sept. 25, 1822:--\r\n\r\n    \"The crop of hops has been very fine here, as well as every where\r\n    else. The crop not only large, but good in quality. They expect to\r\n    get _six_ pounds a hundred for them at Weyhill Fair. That is _one_\r\n    more than I think they will get. The best Sussex hops were selling\r\n    in the Borough of Southwark at three pounds a hundred a few days\r\n    before I left London. The Farnham hops _may_ bring double that\r\n    price; but that, I think, is as much as they will: and this is ruin\r\n    to the hop-planter. The _tax_, with its attendant inconveniences,\r\n    amounts to a pound a hundred; the picking, drying, and bagging to\r\n    50s. The carrying to market not less than 5s. Here is the sum of L3\r\n    10s. of the money. Supposing the crop to be half a ton to the acre,\r\n    the bare tillage will be 10s. The poles for an acre cannot cost less\r\n    than L2 a year; that is another 4s. to each hundred of hops. This\r\n    brings the outgoings to 82s. Then comes the manure, then come the\r\n    poor-rates, and road-rates, and county-rates; and if these leave one\r\n    single farthing for _rent_ I think it is strange.\"\r\n\r\nHop-buyers and sellers in those days met in the old Market House, and\r\nwere doubtless familiar with the queer inscription, still remembered by\r\nmiddle-aged Farnham farmers. John Clark built the Market House in 1566,\r\nand wrote on it his riddle:--\r\n\r\n    \"You who don't like me, give money to mend me,\r\n    You who do like me, give money to end me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Local Board of 1866, looking round for some worthy object on which\r\nto spend their money, liked the old house so well that they ended its\r\nexistence on the spot.\r\n\r\nNo parish church is more difficult to drive up to than St. Andrew's at\r\nFarnham. If you know the way you can come to a corner of the churchyard\r\nby a side street, but Farnham goes to church chiefly by alleys and\r\nfootpaths. The churchyard is more striking than the church, much of\r\nwhich is new. The thick turf, shaven and level, runs to the foot of\r\nmossy brick walls; an avenue of pollarded elms leads from the south\r\ndoor; all round stand little, old red houses. Six o'clock on a sunny\r\nautumn evening is the time to wait in Farnham churchyard. Every three\r\nhours the mellow, feeble bells ring a chime which suits September\r\ntwilight:--\r\n\r\n    \"Life let us cherish\r\n    While yet the taper glows,\r\n    And the fresh floweret\r\n    Pluck ere it close.\r\n\r\n    Away with every toil and care,\r\n    And cease the rankling thorn to wear;\r\n    With manful hearts life's conflict meet,\r\n    Till Death sounds the retreat.\"\r\n\r\nVernon House, a Tudor building changed from its old name, Culver Hall,\r\nand altered so as to front on West Street, has an unhappy memory of the\r\nParliament wars. Charles the First lodged there one December night, a\r\nclosely guarded prisoner on his way from Hurst Castle to Windsor. A\r\nmonth later he was to leave Windsor for Whitehall. He had little to give\r\nhis host, and gave him all he had. It was a white morning cap of quilted\r\nsilk, which Mr. George Vernon, inheriting from his grandfather, left in\r\n1732 to his grandson, \"desiring it may always go to the next heir male\r\nof my family, as a testimony of our steadfast loyalty and adherence to\r\nthe Crown, which is the only bounty my family ever received for all the\r\nlosses and expenses they sustained for the royal cause, which amounted\r\nto several thousands of pounds.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In Farnham Churchyard._]\r\n\r\nI had nearly forgotten Farnham's painter. He was Stephen Elmer, and a\r\npicture of his, \"The Last Supper,\" hangs in the church tower. But his\r\nforte was painting fish and game, dead and alive. In a curious old\r\npamphlet, \"_The Earwig, or An Old Woman's Remarks on the present\r\nExhibition of Pictures of the Royal Academy--a critical pamphlet\r\npublished in Fleet Street_, 1781, I find the following entries. Of the\r\npainters and subjects, Mr. Elmer and Mrs. Robinson belong to Surrey. The\r\nrest supply the setting:--\r\n\r\n    \"10. Thais--Sir Joshua Reynolds, R.A.--The face was painted from the\r\n    famous Emily Bertie ... It was a cruel _snouch_ in the Painter, a\r\n    fine Girl having paid him seventy-five guineas for an hour's work,\r\n    and being unable to pay for the other half of her portrait, to\r\n    exhibit her with such a sarcastic allusion to her private life--to\r\n    call her Thais--to put a torch in her hand, and direct her to set\r\n    flames to the temple of Chastity. Such rigorous punishment seldom is\r\n    inflicted by a rich man on a pretty woman, merely from her want of\r\n    money.\r\n\r\n    79. Damn'd bad.\r\n\r\n    106. Mrs. Mahon in the character of Elvira--J. Roberts.--Painting,\r\n    painted.\r\n\r\n    107. Portrait of Mrs. Robinson--J. Roberts.--At some distance the\r\n    effect nearly the same as the preceding number; but on closer\r\n    inspection, the colour not quite so thickly laid on. We must do\r\n    justice to the Exhibiting Artists by saying that there are no worse\r\n    _of their size_ in the room than these Dulcineas.\r\n\r\n    129. Brace of Pheasants--S. Elmer, A.--No artist can come nearer to\r\n    the object he attempts. His fish, his birds, and fruit are as\r\n    exquisitely fine as any of the Flemish masters.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Gallery lacks an Elmer: private collectors may be luckier.\r\nMr. J.E. Harting, to whom all Surrey naturalists owe a debt, reminds me\r\nthat many of Elmer's best pictures were engraved to illustrate Daniel's\r\n_Rural Sports_, and that it was Elmer who painted the picture of the\r\nhybrid between a blackcock and a pheasant which readers of _Selborne_\r\nwill remember was sent by Lord Stawell to Gilbert White. \"It had been\r\nfound by the spaniels of one of his keepers in a coppice, and shot on\r\nthe wing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFRENSHAM AND TILFORD\r\n\r\n    A Surrey Labourer.--The Witch's Caldron.--Frensham Ponds.--The Last\r\n    of the Blackcock.--Herons and Waterlilies.--The Tilford\r\n    Oak.--Cobbett's Mistake.--Silver Billy.--The heroic age of\r\n    Cricketers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarnham has expanded to the south-east, and not prettily. But it is the\r\nkey to the great stretch of pine wood, heather and bogland which lies to\r\nthe south about Frensham, Tilford and Crooksbury Hill; and it is the\r\nbest centre from which to visit Waverley Abbey and Moor Park, and to\r\ntake long walks over some of the wildest country in the county. A week\r\nwould not be long enough to explore the dozen square miles south of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWrecclesham lies to the south-west, almost on the Hampshire border, and\r\nstill makes green pottery of patterns which were favourites in the\r\nsixteenth century. Further south runs the tiny Bourne, the stream by\r\nwhich Cobbett and his brothers had so good an education, as we have just\r\nseen, in the sand. The Bourne, which runs dry in summer, has few\r\nassociations as a stream; one, perhaps, will remain with it. Readers of\r\n_The Bettesworth Book_ and _Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer_ will perhaps\r\nnot be very wrong if they fix on this sandy valley as the Surrey which\r\nBettesworth knew best. Than the _Memoirs_, I think, no more discerning\r\nstudy of an old labourer's fight to keep on his own legs, out of the\r\nworkhouse, earning his own money with his spade and hoe, belongs to any\r\nSurrey village.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pierrepont House and Bridge._]\r\n\r\nDeep country begins south of the Bourne, with the first Surrey bridge\r\nover the Wey, or rather one of the two Weys that are to join at Tilford.\r\nUntouched as yet by any town, the little river runs here over gravel and\r\nsand, clear and weedy. Trout lie under the bridge below Pierrepont\r\nHouse, in George III's day a seat of Evelyn Duke of Kingston, who named\r\nit after his family. He was the Duke who married the beautiful Countess\r\nof Bristol when her lawful husband was still alive: perhaps she used to\r\nstare into the Wey at Pierrepont and wonder whether it was worth doing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Beside Frensham Pond._]\r\n\r\nFrensham stands a little distant from the river, just a cottage or two\r\nand a church. But the church holds a famous relic--an enormous caldron\r\nof beaten copper. Nobody knows its age; everybody has a story about it.\r\nIt was brought by the fairies, is one tradition; it was nothing of the\r\nkind, is another. Mother Ludlam, the witch of Moor Park, four miles\r\naway, used it for boilings and philtremakings, according to one story;\r\nyet another connects it with a great stone which used to lie in the\r\nneighbourhood. John Aubrey, the antiquary, who \"perambulated\" Surrey in\r\n1673 and 1674, gives the legend in full:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the vestry of the church, on the north side of the chancel, is\r\n    an extraordinary great kettle or caldron, which the inhabitants say,\r\n    by tradition, was brought hither by the fairies, time out of mind,\r\n    from Borough hill, about a mile from hence. To this place, if any\r\n    one went to borrow a yoke of oxen, money, etc., he might have it for\r\n    a year or longer so he kept his word to return it. There is a cave\r\n    where some have fancied to hear music. On this Borough hill (in the\r\n    Tithing of Cherte, in the parish of Frensham) is a great stone lying\r\n    along, of the length of about six feet: they went to this Stone, and\r\n    knocked at it, and declared that they would borrow, and when they\r\n    would repay, and a Voice would answer when they should come, and\r\n    that they should find what they desired to borrow at that Stone.\r\n    This caldron, with the trivet, was borrowed here after the manner\r\n    aforesaid, but not returned according to promise; and though the\r\n    caldron was afterwards carried to the stone, it could not be\r\n    received, and ever since that time no borrowing there....\r\n\r\n    \"The people saw a great fire one night (not long since), the next\r\n    day they went to see if any heath was burnt there, but found\r\n    nothing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Frensham Pond Hotel._]\r\n\r\n\"These stories,\" says Aubrey, \"are verily believed by most of the old\r\nwomen of this parish, and by many of their daughters.\" The daughters\r\nought to have known better. So ought Aubrey, according to Salmon,\r\nanother Surrey historian, writing in 1736. He cannot understand why\r\nthere should be anything astonishing about the size of the caldron,\r\n\"there having been many in England till lately to be seen, as well as\r\nvery large spits which were given for entertainment of the parish at the\r\nwedding of poor maids.\" It was a notable thing to roast an ox whole.\r\nClearly it would be satisfactory to boil a sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Frensham Pond._]\r\n\r\nFrom Frensham village a road runs straight across the common to the\r\nsouth-west corner of the Great Pond, but the prettiest road to the water\r\nis by the side of the Wey. The Wey runs here deep and clean, edged with\r\nforget-me-nots through all the summer, winding and straightening through\r\nserene and shining pastures. There is nothing quieter in all Surrey than\r\nthis little path by the tiny river, with the bank on one side rich with\r\nroses and elderflower, and on the other the sunlight gleaming on the\r\nchestnut coats of the cattle moving slowly through the sedge. Here is an\r\nold oak bridge, solid and lichened; here, facing the stream, a high bank\r\nof white sand, bored and tunnelled by sand-martins; a little further,\r\nand the brushwood flames with the pink and crimson spires of a thousand\r\nfoxgloves. The grassy path runs on, until on a sudden bend the ground\r\nrises, and over a wooden stile opens out the vista of the great\r\nFrensham Pond. Could there be a deeper contrast? Behind lies green\r\npasture-land, rush and sedge, oak and alder; before you, the shoulder of\r\na hill purple with ling, the long level of grey and silver water,\r\ndancing under the wind away to a far strip of yellow sand flecked with\r\npatches of white foam; high above that, burnt and blackened ridges of\r\nheather-ground and gorse. Frensham Pond has often been painted, but that\r\nis the view I should choose, as I saw it first. To one coming up from\r\nthese green depths of pasture, the air blows across the water with the\r\nfreshness of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, beyond Frensham Pond._]\r\n\r\nFrensham Pond still lies open and wild to the sky, though it may not be\r\nlong before its shyer visitors leave it for more secluded waters. The\r\nmotor omnibuses from Farnham have not yet frightened them all away. Coot\r\nand moorhens paddle in and out of the reeds, and great grebes float\r\nleisurely about its surface. It has always been famous for its fishing.\r\nIn Aubrey's time it was \"well known for its carps to the London\r\nfishmongers,\" and to-day it holds pike, perch and tench. I heard of no\r\ncarp. Who would eat a carp?\r\n\r\nIn the bar of the little inn that stands on the edge of Frensham Pond\r\nthere is an interesting case holding two blackcocks and a grey-hen,\r\nwhose unhappy lot it was to be shot--perhaps the last of their race seen\r\nin this part of Surrey. They were killed nineteen years ago, in 1889.\r\nActually the last blackcock chronicled in Surrey were a pair seen near\r\nHindhead, I believe in 1906.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, from Frensham Common._]\r\n\r\nFrom Frensham Great Pond one may push on to Hindhead, three or four\r\nmiles to the south-east, or may return to Farnham through Tilford by way\r\nof the Little Pond, another broad and shining stretch of water. The way\r\nto Farnham is the better, for it means leaving the high road for the\r\nnatural paths that run over and round the windy ridges of the commonland\r\nto the east. From the rising ground between the two Frensham ponds there\r\nis a fine panorama of pine and heather. Crooksbury Hill juts up dark and\r\ncommanding to the north; the level line of the ridge on the left, a few\r\nhundred yards away, is broken and humped with barrows; far away to the\r\neast lies Charterhouse, grey in the haze by Godalming; behind, to the\r\nsouth-east, the Devil's Jumps, three little squat, conical hills whose\r\nvery oddity is one of their attractions. They edge the horizon like\r\ninverted pudding bowls covered with bracken, and with bell-heather\r\nkindling to crimson in the July sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bridge at Tilford._]\r\n\r\nJuly is the month in which to visit Frensham Little Pond. It was an\r\naccident which first showed me the pond as it ought to be seen, and as\r\nfew see it. I had been watching a number of herons through my glasses;\r\none of them eyeing me discontentedly from the reeds on a southern arm of\r\nthe water, and three more flapping majestically over the trees,\r\napparently dropping suddenly down into the valley of the Wey. Trying to\r\ntake a short cut to the stream I missed my way among the woodland rides,\r\nand suddenly found myself again on the edge of the pond. It was worth\r\nmaking the mistake. The northern corner of the pond by the little\r\nboathouse is one sheet of white waterlilies. The corner runs into a\r\nrough triangle, with two sides fifty yards in length and a base of\r\nperhaps thirty yards. There must be nearly a thousand square yards of\r\nlilies, and from five to ten lilies to the yard, green buds, opening\r\nblossoms, and great white cups and gold-centred chalices, wet and\r\nswaying in the wind. Through all the summer those lilies flower, and\r\nthere cannot be as many people see them as there are lilies.\r\nFortunately, it would be difficult to find them unless you were walking:\r\nyou could not drive a motor-car or ride a bicycle down those sandy\r\nlanes, and nobody on foot would pick the lilies.\r\n\r\nTo walk from Frensham Little Pond over Tilford Common to Tilford is to\r\ntraverse some of the wildest and freshest commonland in Surrey. For some\r\ndistance from the northern corner of the pond the way runs through\r\nwoodland, crossed and recrossed by so many sandy paths that it is a good\r\ndeal easier to get lost than to find the high road running into Tilford\r\nfrom the south. It is worth while getting lost, for that matter, if only\r\nto realise the wildness of the place; though it would perhaps be better\r\nto choose daytime for the business, for there are some awkward-looking,\r\nthough perhaps not dangerous, bogs on the lower ground near the Wey.\r\nThis lower ground, by the way, is a wonderful place for rabbits. You\r\ncome suddenly out from the wood on the border of a reedy field, and see\r\ndozens of scampering bodies cleaving paths through the shaking rushes.\r\nNow and then a rabbit, puzzled by the silence following the sound of the\r\ninvader's coming, sits and cocks up a pair of ears above the grass; his\r\nhead goes a little higher, his timorous eye catches yours, and the\r\ngreenery closes behind him.\r\n\r\nTilford to-day cannot be very different from the Tilford of the days of\r\nCobbett. It is a straggling little hamlet, lying about the triangle\r\nformed by its cricket-green. The Wey runs halfway round the green, and\r\nis crossed by two grey and ancient bridges. But the chief glory of\r\nTilford is its mighty oak, one of the greatest of English trees. Its age\r\nis unknown, and perhaps would hardly be known if it were felled. It has\r\nbeen claimed as \"the oak at Kynghoc,\" mentioned in the charter given to\r\nWaverley Abbey in 1128; but that oak is mentioned as standing on the\r\nAbbeyland boundary, and the Tilford oak has never stood on the boundary.\r\nThese historic oaks make difficult problems. Wherever you find a great\r\ntree, local legend gathers round it. Queen Elizabeth dined under it or\r\nshot a stag under it; Charles II climbed in it; Wesley preached under\r\nit; it is the boundary of the parish; it was the boundary of the\r\nAbbeyland eight hundred years ago. But was it always, then, the greatest\r\ntree for miles round? Eight hundred years ago, may there not have stood\r\nanother tree near where it stands to-day, as large or even larger?\r\nSurely the traditions of one great tree pass, when the tree falls, to\r\nits nearest great neighbour; but they pass so seldom, and so slowly,\r\nthat the villagers hardly note the change. Three generations are born\r\nand die, and no villager living has seen the older greater oak; the\r\nyounger, slighter tree succeeds to its glories. Tilford's oak to-day is\r\ncalled by all Tilford the King's Oak. On the old estate maps it is\r\nNovel's Oak; Novel, perhaps, was a yeoman farmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Between Tilford and Elstead._]\r\n\r\nCobbett made a curious mistake about the Tilford Oak. He and his son\r\nwere riding through Tilford to Farnham on an autumn day in 1822:--\r\n\r\n    \"We veered a little to the left after we came to Tilford, at which\r\n    place on the Green we stopped to look at an _oak tree_, which, when\r\n    I was a little boy, was but a very little tree, comparatively, and\r\n    which is now, take it altogether, by far the finest tree that I ever\r\n    saw in my life. The stem or shaft is short; that is to say, it is\r\n    short before you come to the first limbs; but it is full _thirty\r\n    feet round_, at about eight or ten feet from the ground. Out of the\r\n    stem there come not less than fifteen or sixteen limbs, many of\r\n    which are from five to ten feet round, and each of which would, in\r\n    fact, be considered a decent stick of timber. I am not judge enough\r\n    of timber to say anything about the quantity in the whole tree, but\r\n    my son stepped the ground, and, as nearly as we could judge, the\r\n    diameter of the extent of the branches was upwards of ninety feet,\r\n    which would make a circumference of about three hundred feet. The\r\n    tree is in full growth at this moment. There is a little hole in one\r\n    of the limbs; but with that exception, there appears not the\r\n    smallest sign of decay.\"\r\n\r\nVisitors to Tilford can amuse themselves with trying over Cobbett's\r\nmeasurements. I could not reach to measure it ten feet from the ground;\r\nbut at five feet I made its girth, in July, 1907, twenty-four feet nine\r\ninches. Probably it was not much less when Cobbett was a little boy.\r\nThat independent, combative mind would not accept another's\r\nmeasurements, and if he remembered the tree as a little tree, then a\r\nlittle tree he was right in remembering. Since his day the signs of\r\ndecay have set in; the oak is still superb, but a Jubilee sapling has\r\nbeen planted as a neighbour. Centuries hence the sapling, perhaps, will\r\nbe the King's Oak again.\r\n\r\nTilford has another memory of green old age. William Beldham--\"Silver\r\nBilly,\" because of his straw-coloured hair--lived most of his life in\r\nthe village, where he kept an inn, and died in a cottage close under the\r\noak. He was born at Wrecclesham on February 5, 1766, and died February\r\n20, 1862, aged 96, having played thirty-five years' unbroken \"great\"\r\ncricket, as Lillywhite calls it--a finer name than first-class. Let John\r\nNyren, most discerning of biographers, describe him:--\r\n\r\n    \"William Beldham was a close-set, active man, standing about five\r\n    feet eight inches and a-half. He had light-coloured hair, a fair\r\n    complexion, and handsome as well as intelligent features. We used to\r\n    call him 'Silver Billy.' No one within my recollection could stop a\r\n    ball better, or make more brilliant hits all over the ground.\r\n    Wherever the ball was bowled, there she was hit away, and in the\r\n    most severe, venomous style. Besides this, he was so remarkably safe\r\n    a player; he was safer than the Bank, for no mortal ever thought of\r\n    doubting Beldham's stability. He received his instructions from a\r\n    gingerbread baker at Farnham, of the name of Harry Hall....\r\n\r\n    \"He would get in at the balls, and hit them away in a gallant style;\r\n    yet, in this single feat, I think I have seen him excelled; but when\r\n    he could cut them at the point of the bat he was in his glory; and\r\n    upon my life, their speed was as the speed of thought.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The King's Oak, Tilford._]\r\n\r\nWhen were the great days of Surrey cricket? When Surrey could lend All\r\nEngland William Beldham, and still win--which they did twice--a Tilford\r\nman might answer. At all events, they were days in which cricketers\r\nlived to heroic ages. Abarrow, who lies at Hambledon over the Hampshire\r\nborder, lived to be 88; James Aylward, \"rather a bulky man for a\r\ncricketer,\" was buried close to Lord's ground, aged 86; Barber, who\r\nkept the Bat and Ball on Broad Halfpenny Down, was 71; William Fennex,\r\nat the age of 75, walked ninety miles in three days, carrying an\r\numbrella, clothes, and three cricket bats (but he died soon after);\r\nWilliam Lambert, almost the greatest of Surrey hitters, and the first\r\nplayer who ever made two centuries in the same match, died at 72; Lumpy\r\nStevens, who won L100 for Lord Tankerville by hitting a feather once in\r\nfour balls, and lies in Walton churchyard, was 84; John Small, who saved\r\nhis life by playing his violin to a ferocious bull, to the \"admiration\r\nand perfect satisfaction of the mischievous beast,\" lived to be 89; Tom\r\nSueter--\"I have never seen a handsomer man than Tom Sueter,\" wrote\r\nNyren--lived to be 77; \"Shock\" White, with his bat as broad as his\r\nstumps, \"a short and rather stoutly-made man,\" was buried at Reigate,\r\naged 91; Yalden of Chertsey,--he jumped over a fence and then on his\r\nback caught the ball--was 84; and John Wells, buried at Farnham, died at\r\nthe age of 76. John Wells shared with \"Silver Billy\" a curious\r\ndistinction. He was Beldham's brother-in-law, and an admiring publican\r\nat Wrecclesham put up a sign to draw thirsty wayfarers to Wrecclesham's\r\nbest beer. It was \"The Rendezvous of the Celebrated Cricketers, Beldham\r\nand Wells.\" If it were still standing, it would attract a pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWAVERLEY ABBEY AND MOOR PARK\r\n\r\n    Jonathan Swift, Secretary.--A new Tale of a Tub.--Sir William\r\n    Temple, Essayist.--Swift's \"Stella.\"--A heart under a\r\n    sundial.--Dorothy Osborne.--Mother Ludlam's Cave--Waverley\r\n    Abbey.--Two tons of wine.--Comfort from Cromwell.--A Surrey\r\n    Landmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly two miles from Farnham, and reached by a road overarched by fine\r\noaks, Moor Park stands on the banks of the Wey. A turn in the lane\r\nthrows open a view of rich hayfields and pasture, with the river winding\r\nin and out under a ridge of oakwoods; much the same view, perhaps, as\r\nSwift first had of the fields and the Wey when he came to Moor Park from\r\nIreland to copy out Sir William Temple's essays and to meet the\r\ndark-eyed waiting-maid who was to inspire one of the great passions of\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nMoor Park was Sir William Temple's new name for an old manor. The name\r\nunder which he bought the house and land was Compton Hall, and he\r\nrenamed it after a property in Hertfordshire. \"The perfectest figure of\r\na garden I ever saw, either at home or abroad, was that of Moor Park in\r\nHertfordshire, when I knew it about thirty years ago,\" he wrote in his\r\n_Essay on the Gardens of Epicures_: and he laid out his own garden in\r\nthe Dutch style which he admired. The garden has changed with the\r\nchanging tastes of later owners; the house has fared a little better,\r\nthough it was once metamorphosed into a Hydropathic Sanatorium--a new\r\nand dismal Tale of a Tub.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Moor Park._]\r\n\r\nMoor Park, when Sir William Temple had it, saw the writing of many\r\nbooks. Sir William Temple himself, deeply hurt with his sovereign, James\r\nII, for striking his name off the Privy Council, had vowed to give up\r\ndiplomacy and turn to gardening and writing for the rest of his life.\r\nHis gardening may have been as good as his writing, and his essay on\r\nGardening is, of all his writings, perhaps the best. But it was in his\r\nseclusion at Moor Park that he wrote, also, one of the most ridiculous\r\npapers that ever brought the fame of an essayist to a retired\r\npolitician. His _Essay Upon the Ancient and Modern Learning_ remains one\r\nof the most astonishing examples of the admirable writing down of trash\r\nin the history of letters. Quite unnecessarily, he had taken up the task\r\nof comparing modern writers with ancient, to the disadvantage of the\r\nmodern, and he cannot be said to have been well equipped for the\r\nbusiness. He had never read a word of Greek, and he achieved the\r\ndistinction of criticising modern writing without a single reference to\r\nthe works of Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto, Moliere, Racine,\r\nCorneille, Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and Shakespeare. The extraordinary\r\nthing is that the book was welcomed, and when a quarrel was struck over\r\nhis claim that the Letters of Phalaris (which he could not read) were\r\nthe best Letters in the world, he found ready champions. They were\r\nhopelessly defeated by Bentley, but Sir William Temple fortunately died\r\nbefore the defeat.\r\n\r\nBetter books were written at Moor Park by Sir William's secretary.\r\nJonathan Swift, angry and rebellious, hating the authority and restraint\r\nof his Irish University, came to England an uncouth, ill-balanced,\r\nextravagant creature of twenty-one, and settled, or half-settled, to his\r\nwork as amanuensis. He threw up his post in a rage, went over to Ireland\r\nand was ordained priest, made up his quarrel with his patron and came\r\nback to Moor Park to write _The Tale of a Tub_ and _The Battle of the\r\nBooks_. But the books were almost incidents. The mainspring of his life\r\nwas his melancholy devotion to the pretty girl who waited on Lady\r\nGiffard, Sir William Temple's sister. She was Esther Johnson, daughter\r\nof Sir William's steward, but as Swift's Stella she lives in the story\r\nof sad and mysterious passions with Heloise and Laura.\r\n\r\nSir William Temple died in 1699, and was buried by his wife's side in\r\nWestminster Abbey; all but his heart, and that was laid in a silver box\r\nunder the sundial in his garden. He left his papers to Swift, who wrote\r\nthat there had died \"with him all that was good and amiable among men,\"\r\nand to prove it quarrelled acrimoniously with the family.\r\n\r\nOf another, gentler inmate of Moor Park we hear very little. Her fame\r\nwas assured her when, as Dorothy Osborne, she had waited seven years to\r\nmarry William Temple, and had sent to him, without an idea that they\r\nwould reach an English public, some of the most graceful girlish letters\r\never written. After her marriage she leaves the scene, or we see her\r\nseldom. She corresponded with Queen Mary, but Swift has little to tell\r\nus about her. She, at least, could never have enraged him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Stella's Cottage._]\r\n\r\nMoor Park lies along the banks of the Wey, and through it runs a drive\r\nopen to foot passengers, but not to bicycles or dogs. Nearly at the end\r\nof the drive going towards Waverley Abbey is a curious cave, lined and\r\nroofed at the entrance with stone, and barred and gated and spiked with\r\niron, evidently a fit habitation, once upon a time, for a very\r\nwitch-like old woman. The gates, or rather railings which do not open,\r\nmust have been placed there many years ago, for no initials have been\r\ncarved, or at least none are visible, on the stone within. The cave runs\r\nback, some way from the road, into pleasantly dubious darkness. In this\r\ncase, according to the tradition of the place, lived the witch, Mother\r\nLudlam, whose caldron lies in the tower of Frensham Church. Another\r\nexcavation in the ground a few yards away has also its own tradition,\r\nor rather two traditions. One is that it was the regular abode of a\r\nhermit named Foote, who starved to death in it; another, that Foote was\r\na lunatic who was found dying in the hole, but actually died in the\r\nworkhouse. The details are precise. \"Foote was a gentleman. He came one\r\nday to the Unicorn Inn at Farnham. Next day he hired a man to wheel a\r\nheavy portmanteau to Moor Park gate, when he told the man to put it\r\ndown. Foote was taken very ill, was found by old Hill the keeper and\r\ntaken to Swift's cottage where Hill lived. The union officials took\r\nFoote and his heavy portmanteau to the Union. 'It's only buttons\r\ninside,' said they. 'It's gold! gold!' exclaimed Foote with his dying\r\nbreath.\" So runs the local version.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In Moor Park._]\r\n\r\nAt the gates of the entrance of Moor Park stands a charming cottage,\r\nbrick and timber embowered in roses. It has been known at different\r\ntimes as \"Dean Swift's Cottage\" and \"Stella's Cottage.\" Perhaps neither\r\nlived there. Outside the park the Wey broadens out into a wide pool,\r\nshaded by magnificent sycamores, and then drops through sluices to a\r\nlower level, to twist back to the north-west under the walls of Waverley\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nWaverley Abbey is the greatest of the ruins in a county where ruins are\r\nfew. Once the Abbey precinct covered sixty acres of ground; to-day\r\nnothing remains but tumbled walls and broken gates. It was not the\r\noldest nor the richest of Abbeys in the county, but in some ways it was\r\nthe noblest foundation of all. It was the earliest house of Cistercian\r\nmonks in England; it inherited the spirit and the traditions of one of\r\nthe finest of the monastic orders, the stricter sect of the monks of St.\r\nBenedict; its brethren were simple, kindly men with few wants and little\r\nmoney, who yet were generous hosts and the most skilful farmers of their\r\nday; it was the elder sister of Tintern Abbey, the mother of the Abbeys\r\nof Garendon, Ford, Combe and Thame, and the grandmother of seven others;\r\nand its abbots had precedence in the chapters of abbots throughout the\r\norder of Cistercians.\r\n\r\nThe White Monks, as the Cistercians were called, used to choose wild and\r\nlonely places for their churches, and Waverley Abbey, which stands in\r\nfields even now sometimes flooded, in its early days was more than once\r\nin difficulties through rain and bad seasons. It was founded in 1128 by\r\nWilliam Giffard, the second Bishop of Winchester after the Conquest,\r\nand the buildings were still unfinished when, in 1201, a great storm\r\ninundated the Abbey, almost carried away its walls, and ruined all its\r\ncrops, wheat, hay, and flax. Two years later, from the failure of the\r\nharvest after the flood, corn was so scarce that the monks had to\r\nscatter themselves among other Convents till they could thresh another\r\nsummer's corn. In 1215 the spring from which they got all the water\r\nsuddenly failed, and the monks were without water for their wine till\r\none of them found a fresh spring and took it by pipes to the admiring\r\nAbbey. Eighteen years later came another storm and vast floods; the\r\nwater rushed through the Abbey grounds, carrying away walls and bridges,\r\nand was eight feet deep in the buildings. There were other floods; in\r\n1265 the monks had to sleep where they could out of the water, and it\r\ntook days to clean away the silted mud. Those were some of the penalties\r\nof being so conveniently near to a river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Waverley Abbey._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Waverley Abbey._]\r\n\r\nRound the buildings accumulated the traditional virtues. The Annals of\r\nWaverley record that in 1248 a youth fell by accident from the very\r\nparapet of the church tower to the ground without receiving the smallest\r\ninjury. He was stupefied, and was thought to be dead, but after a little\r\nwhile began to speak and to be sensible, and soon completely recovered.\r\nOn an earlier occasion, Aubrey tells us that \"a boy of seven or eight\r\nyears of age, standing near the Abbey gate, fell into the river, on the\r\nFeast of the Invention of the Cross, and by the rapidity of the stream\r\nwas drove through four of the bridges, and was afterwards found on the\r\nsurface of the water, dead to all outward appearance; but being taken\r\nout and carefully attended, he was brought to life, and came to his post\r\nat the gate from whence he had not been missed nor inquired after.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the church was dedicated in 1278--it had taken seventy-five years\r\nto build--there was great rejoicing and a superb banquet. Nicholas de\r\nEly, Bishop of Winchester, to make the occasion splendid, supplied\r\nfeasting at his own expense for nine days to all who attended; abbots,\r\nlords, knights and noble ladies came to the dedication, and on the first\r\nday seven thousand and sixty-six guests sat down to meat. That is\r\nWaverley's greatest record of hospitality. Another record belongs to a\r\nguest. King John spent four days at the Abbey in Holy Week, 1208, and on\r\nthat occasion one R. de Cornhull was ordered to be paid five marks for\r\n\"two tons of wine\" carried from Pagham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Grounds, Waverley Abbey._]\r\n\r\nAt the Dissolution Waverley's end came quickly. The Abbey was one of the\r\nfirst of the smaller monasteries to fall. The obsequious adventurer whom\r\nThomas Cromwell sent to Waverley to report on the Abbey establishment\r\nwas Doctor Layton, and evidently he was neither feasted nor bribed by\r\nthe simple Abbot and his monks. Thus he writes to Cromwell after his\r\nvisit:--\r\n\r\n    To the right honorable Mr. Thomas Crumwell, chief secretary to the\r\n    King's highness.\r\n\r\n    It may please your mastership to understand that I have licenced the\r\n    bringer, the Abbot of Waverley, to repair unto you for liberty to\r\n    survey his husbandry whereupon consisteth the wealth of his\r\n    monastery. The man is honest, but none of the children of Solomon:\r\n    every monk within his house is his fellow, and every servant his\r\n    master. Mr. Treasurer and other gentlemen hath put servants unto him\r\n    whom the poor [fool?] dare neither command nor displease. Yesterday,\r\n    early in the morning, sitting in my chamber in examination, I could\r\n    neither get bread nor drink, neither fire of those knaves till I was\r\n    fretished; and the Abbot durst not speak to them. I called them all\r\n    before me, and forgot their names, but took from every man the keys\r\n    of his office, and made new officers for my time here, perchance as\r\n    stark knaves as the others. It shall be expedient for you to give\r\n    him a lesson and tell the poor fool what he should do. Among his\r\n    monks I found corruption of the worst sort, because they dwell in\r\n    the forest from all company. Thus I pray God preserve you. From\r\n    Waverley this morning early before day, ready to depart towards\r\n    Chichester, by the speedy hand of your most assured servant and poor\r\n    priest,\r\n\r\n    RICHARD LAYTON.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to learn that the weasely Doctor was \"fretished,\"\r\nwhich must be pretty nearly the same thing as perished with cold and\r\nhunger. The Abbot's plea for his monastery--surely one of the honestest\r\nletters ever written--sets in contrast the characters of the monastery\r\nand its visitor. He writes to Cromwell on June 9, 1536:--\r\n\r\n    To the right honourable Master Secretary to the King.\r\n\r\n    Pleaseth your mastership I received your letters of the vij^th day\r\n    of this present month, and hath endeavoured myself to accomplish the\r\n    contents of them, and have sent your mastership the true extent,\r\n    value, and account of our said monastery. Beseeching your good\r\n    mastership, for the love of Christ's passion, to help to the\r\n    preservation of this poor monastery, that we your beadsmen may\r\n    remain in the service of God, with the meanest living that any poor\r\n    men may live with, in this world. So to continue in the service of\r\n    Almighty Jesus, and to pray for the estate of our prince and your\r\n    mastership. In no vain hope I write this to your mastership, for as\r\n    much you put me in such boldness full gently, when I was in suit to\r\n    you the last year at Winchester, saying, 'Repair to me for such\r\n    business as ye shall have from time to time.' Therefore, instantly\r\n    praying you, and my poor brethren with weeping yes!--desire you to\r\n    help them; in this world no creatures in more trouble. And so we\r\n    remain depending upon the comfort that shall come to us from\r\n    you--serving God daily at Waverley. From thence the ix^th day of\r\n    June, 1536.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM, the poor Abbot there, your chaplain to command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Crooksbury Hill and Frensham Little Pond, from Frensham\r\nCommon._]\r\n\r\nThe comfort that came to the White Monks was the dissolution of the\r\nAbbey in the month following. After the dissolution the buildings fell\r\ngradually to pieces, generously helped by builders of other houses. When\r\nSir William More was giving Loseley near Guildford the shape we see\r\nto-day he carted waggon-load after waggon-load of stone from the ruined\r\nchurch, and Sir William More was perhaps not the first and certainly not\r\nthe last of the spoilers. The neighbourhood quarried from the ruins\r\nuntil only a few years ago. When Aubrey saw the Abbey in 1672 he found\r\nthe walls of a church, cloisters, a chapel used as a stable, and part of\r\nthe house with its window-glass intact, and paintings of St. Dunstan and\r\nthe devil, pincers, crucibles and all. To-day most of the ruins have\r\nfallen flat. There is some beautiful vaulting left, and massive heaps of\r\nstone show the corners and boundaries of the church and other buildings.\r\nIvy-stems, coils of green gigantic pythons, climb about the walls and\r\nbroken doorways; pigeons nest on the window-ledges and clatter like\r\nfrightened genii out over the field.\r\n\r\nAbove Moor Park, a landmark for miles round, Crooksbury Hill lifts like\r\na dark pyramid. Crooksbury Hill has a dozen different wardrobes. You may\r\nwake to find her grey in the morning, you may leave her behind you\r\ngrey-green with the sun full on her flank, you may turn at noon to find\r\nthe sun lighting her deep emerald; she is sunniest and hottest in a\r\nshining blue; and in the evening with the setting sun behind her she\r\ncloaks herself in purple and black as if her pines belonged to Scotland.\r\nShe cannot see so far as Chanctonbury Ring, which is the watching\r\ncomrade of all walkers in the country of the South Downs, and she has\r\nnot the height of Leith Hill or Hindhead; but she is the grave and\r\nconstant companion of all travellers for many miles round her, and\r\nmeasures for them the angle of the sun or the slope of the stars, as do\r\nall good landmarks for those who love a landmark like a friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Dip in the Hog's Back._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE HOG'S BACK\r\n\r\n    Whitewaysend.--Tongham.--A carillon of\r\n    sheep-bells.--Timber-carting.--Falling on board a\r\n    transport.--Cottages under the Hog's Back.--Puttenham. The Maypole\r\n    at Compton.--The two-storied sanctuary.--A great\r\n    picture.--Bird-baths.--Swarming bees.--The Hog's Back; a noble\r\n    highway.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any of the pilgrims from Farnham were drawn aside down the banks of\r\nthe Wey to the hospitality of Waverley Abbey, they probably rejoined the\r\nrest at the foot of the Hog's Back, perhaps near Whitewaysend. That is a\r\nname with some meaning, for here first the road from Farnham runs up on\r\nto the great chalk ridge which traverses the county from west to east.\r\nThe break in the colour of the roads under the ridge is from bright\r\nyellow sand to staring white, but the full white does not begin until\r\nthe road is almost at its highest level, at the cross-roads above\r\nTongham.\r\n\r\nTongham is the only village between Farnham and Guildford north of the\r\nHog's Back and near the ridge, and though there is little in it for\r\nantiquarians, the pretty little white inn and the oasthouses have often\r\nattracted painters, and the approach to the village from the south is\r\nby a road pillared and canopied with lofty elms. The churchyard holds a\r\ncurious structure. A slender oak tower, recently erected as a memorial,\r\nstands apart from the church, riveted to the ground with iron struts,\r\nand contains a peal of thirteen small bells. A carillon is rung every\r\nSunday and Wednesday; I have not heard it, but have been told that it\r\nsounds \"like sheep-bells.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tongham Church, with Wooden Tower for Bells._]\r\n\r\nNot much can have been written about the older days of Tongham, but at\r\nleast one delightful passage in a modern book belongs to it, and should\r\nbe read under the great elms by the roadside. In Mr. George Bourne's\r\n_Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer_, Bettesworth describes an almost\r\nincredible feat of carting timber:--\r\n\r\n    \"I see a carter once,\" said Bettesworth, \"get three big elm-trees up\r\n    on to a timber-carriage, with only hisself and the hosses. He put\r\n    the runnin' chains on and all hisself.\"\r\n\r\n    \"And _that_ takes some doing,\" I said.\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, a man got to understand the way 'tis done ... I never had\r\n    much hand in timber-cartin' myself; but this man.... 'Twas over\r\n    there on the Hog's Back, not far from Tongham Station. We all went\r\n    out for to see 'n do it--'cause 'twas in the dinner-time he come,\r\n    and we never believed he'd do it single-handed. The farmer says to\r\n    'n, 'You'll never get they up by yourself.' 'I dessay I shall,' he\r\n    says; and so he did, too. Three great elm-trees upon that one\r\n    carriage.... Well, he had a four-hoss team, so that'll tell ye what\r\n    'twas. They _was_ some hosses, too. Ordinary farm hosses wouldn't\r\n    ha' done it. But he only jest had to speak, and you'd see they\r\n    watchin' him.... When he went forward, after he'd got the trees up,\r\n    to see what sort of a road he'd got for gettin' out, they stood\r\n    there with their heads stretched out and their ears for'ard. 'Come\r\n    on,' he says, and _away_ they went, _tearin'_ away. Left great ruts\r\n    in the road where the wheels sent in--that'll show ye they got\r\n    something to pull.\"\r\n\r\n    We got one shrub a little further, Bettesworth grunting to a heavy\r\n    lift; then, in answer to a question:\r\n\r\n    \"No, none o' we helped 'n. We was only gone out to see 'n do it. He\r\n    never wanted no help. He didn't say much; only 'Git back,' or 'Git\r\n    up,' to the hosses. When it come to gettin' the last tree up, on top\r\n    o' t'other two, I never thought he could ha' done it. But he got 'n\r\n    up. And he was a oldish man, too: sixty, I dessay he was. But he\r\n    jest spoke to the hosses. Never used no whip 'xcept jest to guide\r\n    'em. Didn't the old farmer go on at his own men, too! 'You dam\r\n    fellers, call yerselves carters,' he says; 'a man like that's worth\r\n    a dozen o' you.' Well, they couldn' ha' done it. A dozen of 'em 'd\r\n    ha' scrambled about, an' _then_ not done it! Besides, their _hosses_\r\n    wouldn't. But this feller the old farmer says to 'n, 'I never\r\n    believed you'd ha' done it.' 'I thought mos likely I should,' he\r\n    says. But he never had much to say.\"\r\n\r\nA few hundred yards further along the Hog's Back the road drops down\r\nsouth-east to Seale, the first of the three ancient and interesting\r\nvillages which lie under the ridge between Farnham and Guildford. Seale\r\nis a fascinating little place. It consists only of a few cottages, shy\r\nand red-roofed, deep among high hedges, bushy dells and reedy meadows,\r\nwith wheatfields and barleyfields clothing the chalky slopes above. The\r\nchurch has been rebuilt, but has some inscriptions worth looking at. One\r\nis an epitaph on a young officer, Edward Noel Long, who was drowned at\r\nsea. According to the inscription:--\r\n\r\n    \"On his way to join the British forces in Spain, he, with others of\r\n    his regiment, perished in the sea near Cape St. Vincent, during the\r\n    confusion of a fatal accident occasioned by the _Isis_ man-of-war\r\n    falling on board the transport on which he was embarked on the night\r\n    of the 6th March, 1809.\"\r\n\r\nThat was just after Corunna. A carved bas-relief represents the _Isis_\r\nunder full sail \"falling on board\" the transport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seale._]\r\n\r\nHere, under the Hog's Back north and south, nearly all the cottages are\r\nold and nearly all have gardens. One perfect little building stands not\r\nfar from Seale on the road to Puttenham, bowered in vines and quaintly\r\nchimneyed, with white-curtained windows opening on a low wall and\r\nstone-crop and high box borders, and, when I saw it in July, bunches of\r\npink and white mallows glowing under an old oak door. No cottages count\r\nsunnier hours than these that stand about the long strip of green\r\ncountry under the chalk downs. This part of Surrey, perhaps, has changed\r\nas little as any part during the last twenty or thirty years, which have\r\nadded so many miles of brick and slate to Surrey villages and towns;\r\nprobably the greatest change has been in the roads. Mrs. Henry Ady, for\r\ninstance, writing of the Pilgrims' Way just fifteen years ago, speaks of\r\nthe road that runs through Seale, Puttenham, and Compton as being \"a\r\ngrassy lane, not always easy to follow, and little used in places.\" The\r\nroad as it runs here may not take the exact line of the Pilgrims' Way,\r\nbut no one could call it difficult to follow. Here and there it passes\r\nthrough cornfields, and it is by leaving the road to take a footpath\r\nthrough a cornfield that the best view is to be had of Puttenham, whose\r\nred roofs and grey church tower are set delightfully among rich elms,\r\nwith a splash of ploughed chalk blazing white through the trees beyond.\r\nPuttenham has added only a few new cottages to its outskirts; under the\r\nchurch it is still red and mossy and lichened. The cottages are oddly\r\nbuilt to suit the sloping ground, for the road to the church rises on a\r\nhill, and necessitates different levels for foundations and stone\r\npathways. One of the cottages has an outside staircase to its front\r\ndoor, for what reason there is no guessing.\r\n\r\nThe next village under the Hog's Back on the way to Guildford is\r\nCompton, perhaps the third stage of thirsty pilgrims journeying from\r\nWhitewaysend. The main road enters Compton from the north, but the\r\nprettiest way to find the village is to drop down on it by a woodland\r\nfootpath from the west. Icehouse Wood is the name of the few acres of\r\ntrees through which the path runs; an old brick-lined pocket in the side\r\nof the hill suggests the name, but there are remains of another brick\r\nbuilding higher up the slope which look nothing like an icehouse. Was\r\nthe name ever Oasthouse wood, perhaps, and did they grow hops here as at\r\nFarnham? If any pilgrims left the beaten track from Puttenham which runs\r\nnorth of Compton they may have come to the church and the inn by this\r\nfootpath. It is centuries old; it is lined, before it enters the wood,\r\nby ordered holly which may once have marked a road, and as it drops down\r\nthe hill it cuts as deep into the sand as the old trackways north of\r\nAnstiebury Camp or west of Albury. Great beeches coil their roots about\r\nits edge--younger than the road if ever oasthouses stood by it.\r\n\r\nCompton looks like a village presided over by a single mind. The\r\ncottages which add themselves to whatever is old in neighbouring\r\nbuildings are designed to fit with a scheme; the cottage gardens are\r\nchallenges of roses and phloxes, which shall be brightest. The black\r\nbeams and jutting stories of an ancient timbered house stand above the\r\nroad, an example and a guardian; the whole aspect of the village is of\r\nthe quietest country. When I was walking through Compton I was told of a\r\nvillage festival which had been held in the spring, in which children\r\nfrom Bermondsey--Bermondsey once a Thames-side village itself--dressed\r\nin the old dresses and danced the old dances. They had a Queen of the\r\nMay and they twined a maypole with ribands; and as I went out of Compton\r\nthere were the Compton village children, six or seven of them, dancing\r\nover the dances the Bermondsey children had shown them, in the same\r\nfield where the festival was held. The first of May would come round\r\nagain; they would choose their own Queen and twine their own maypole.\r\n\r\nCompton church is one of the most interesting in the country. It must be\r\nforgiven a hideous organ, whose blue and red pipes block the western\r\narch of the nave; the sanctuary is the beauty of the church. It is the\r\nonly two-storied sanctuary in England, and the origin of two-storied\r\nsanctuaries is unknown. Mr. Lewis Andre, writing in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_, is inclined to think that the dedication of\r\nthe upper sanctuary may have been to St. Michael; there are several\r\naltars dedicated to St. Michael in the galleries of continental\r\nchurches. Another feature of the church is the wooden Norman screen\r\nwhich fences off the upper sanctuary; it is the oldest known in England,\r\nand dates back to 1180, according to the archaeologists. Some Jacobean\r\nscreen work in the pulpit and the altar rails is an interesting\r\ncontrast.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile north of Compton are a chapel and a cemetery, the joint gift\r\nof the late George Frederick Watts and Mrs. Watts; the chapel, designed\r\nby Mrs. Watts, strikes a dominant note of terracotta and red brick.\r\nThere are strengths and splendours which belong to the building and its\r\nfrescoes, but to me, at all events, it seems to lack the peace and\r\nmystery of quieter, duller chapels. A noble memorial of a master mind is\r\nthe picture gallery in the grounds of the terracotta designing school\r\nfounded by the late painter's wife. The gallery contains many of his\r\nfinest pictures, and in particular the last of all which he\r\npainted--_Destiny_, a tremendous figure with a shadowed face; masses of\r\nfilmy light are about it, and power moves in the arm that holds the\r\nbook; there is a secret hidden which the grey face knows. The gallery is\r\nlighted as no London gallery is; the ceiling and walls are washed with\r\nold gold, which takes all the hardness from the spaces of sunshine\r\nplaying through the roof. Mrs. Watts, I believe, added this charm to the\r\ngallery. Others besides critics owe her gratitude. Outside the gallery\r\nstand rows of pottery, the work of her pupils. Urns, vases, basins,\r\ncups, pedestals, fountains await translation to flower gardens. The\r\nbirds of many Surrey lawns owe a debt to Compton for wide splash-baths\r\nof water to bathe in and drink at in the heats of summer.\r\n\r\nCompton can be seen either from Guildford or from Godalming, and the\r\ntraveller has the choice at Puttenham either of rejoining the Hog's Back\r\nimmediately above the village, and so dropping down into Wanborough on\r\nthe other side, or going on to Compton and perhaps climbing up again to\r\nthe road on the ridge afterwards. Wanborough, a fascinating little\r\nhamlet, is worth the extra climbs up the hill. It is little more, in\r\nreality, than a manor house or farm homestead, wealthy with huddled\r\nricks and superb barns, and a simple little church, perhaps the tiniest\r\nof all in Surrey; it measures only forty-five feet by eighteen. I found\r\nit locked, but a village child with engaging confidence told me to \"look\r\nunder the brick\" for the key, and under a loose brick in the porch I\r\nfound it. It may be lying there to-day. There is little in the church\r\nitself; but when I saw it there was a fine nest of honeybees in the\r\nroof near the bell that hangs on the wall outside. Why do bees so often\r\nswarm in churchyards? Country villagers believe that they like the sound\r\nof dinning metal; perhaps they are attracted to a church by Sunday's\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wanborough Church._]\r\n\r\nWanborough sends a rough but pleasant field-road up again to the Hog's\r\nBack, which from here runs another four straight miles along the ridge\r\nto Guildford. This is certainly the noblest highway in Surrey, and,\r\nperhaps, the most characteristic of the county. You may often travel\r\nalong it and yet not see the finest of the view on either side; in the\r\nsummer, more frequently than not, the whole countryside north and south\r\nof the ridge is swimming in a blue haze which dims and muffles the\r\nhorizon. But there is no other road on which you can walk so far and see\r\nso much broad Surrey country open out mile after mile on either side,\r\nand from which you can watch so many changes of woodland and common and\r\ncultured fields, from the green and golden hops about Farnham to the\r\nwheat and oats above Seale and Puttenham, and the long potato drills in\r\nthe chalk by Wanborough. But the view is not the single beauty of the\r\nHog's Back, though to walk high in the wind along open spaces is\r\npossible only on a few roads in the county. The Hog's Back has a treble\r\ncharm belonging wholly to the roadway itself; its width, its spacious\r\ngrassy rides on each side of the broad hard riband of metal that runs\r\nwhite and unswerving east and west, and most gracious of all, its deep\r\nand exuberant hedges. All along the road in a light wind you will get\r\nthe scent of bed-straw and thyme and clover from the green border of the\r\nroad, and in the short down grass find the plants that love\r\nchalk-ground, like the little blue milkwort, which spreads like a film\r\nover the higher slopes of the ridge in summer. If the roadside is\r\nscented with flowers, so are the hedges. Guelder rose and dog rose and\r\nprivet blossom side by side with elder and spindle wood; above holly and\r\nhazel and buckthorn stand up gnarled and wind-driven yews, bent over the\r\nroad from the south-west. To the south, it is often only through the\r\ngate-gaps in the hedge that you can see out over the flank of the hill;\r\non the northern side the hedge is lower--low enough, indeed, to be\r\nbroken in summer by tall spikes of mullein, yellow against the grey-blue\r\nair over the heaths of Pirbright and Worplesdon. The highest point of\r\nthe road lies a mile beyond Wanborough on the way to Guildford; here you\r\nare over five hundred feet up, and the road drops gradually, ending with\r\na sudden slope almost as soon as Guildford, bricky and cheap-looking\r\nfrom this aspect, comes into view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Barn at Wanborough._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGUILDFORD\r\n\r\n    The prettiest High Street in the south of England.--Guilou, Wey, and\r\n    Wye.--The Castle.--A legend of murder.--Looking at St.\r\n    Christopher.--Royal hunters.--Stephen Langton.--Cloth and how to\r\n    stretch it.--Aubrey scents a swindle.--King Monmouth after\r\n    Sedgmoor.--A pike for a baby.--The keeper at Bramshill.--Mysterious\r\n    windows.--Admirable calm.--The Queen's.--The Regent and the\r\n    Apse.--St. Mary's Wall-paintings.--An ancient school.--The\r\n    Angel.--Pepys at the Red Lion.--Sparagus for supper.--A Vanished\r\n    Heart.--The undaunted clockmaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo arrive at Guildford by train is like walking into a garden over a\r\nrubbish heap. In the grace of its building, the charm of its colour, the\r\nfascination of the prospects of its hillside High Street, no town in\r\nSurrey, and perhaps only Oxford in England, is comparable with it. But\r\nbetween the railway station and the High Street it is desolation and\r\nblank walls. A few pretty old cottages jut out over a narrow pavement;\r\nbeyond a huddled roof or two rises the tower of St. Nicholas' Church,\r\number and solid; nearly all else is tumbled down ugliness, broken\r\nbrickwork, mud and shaggy grass. A clear space, a level green, a bed of\r\nflowers--what an introduction that might be to Guildford. But,\r\ndoubtless, the rubbish heap is, or some day will be, too valuable as\r\nbuilding land.\r\n\r\nBeyond the turn of the road is the most delightful street in the south\r\nof England. It rises from the bridge crossing the Wey steep into blue\r\nair over the hill. Each side of it is a stairway of roofs up the slope,\r\na medley of facades, a jumble of architecture astonishing in sheer\r\nextravagance and variety. Gabled houses, red-tiled and gay with\r\nrough-cast and fresh paint; dull, sad-faced houses with sleepy windows\r\nlike half-shut eyes; square, solid Georgian houses for doctors with\r\nwhite chokers and snuff-boxes, and prim old ladies with mittened wrists;\r\nlow, little dolls'-houses, red brick neatly pointed; tall, slim houses\r\ngraceful with slender casements and light shafts of wood; casements\r\nnobly elaborate in wood-carving and heavy with leaded panes; bay windows\r\nwhich should belong to nurseries and high, square-latticed windows which\r\nshould light a library, delicately fastened with wrought iron; painted\r\npillars supporting window seats for cats and demure young ladies;\r\nbroad-stepped entrances to hotel halls, and archways under which barrels\r\nroll to bursting cellars; Guildford High Street is a model of what the\r\nHigh Street of an English town should be. Has it a single dominating\r\nfeature, or is its air of distinction merely compact of the grace and\r\nold-worldliness of its shops and houses? Perhaps the single extreme\r\nimpression left by the High Street is its clock, swung far out over the\r\nroad. Massive, black and gilt, and fastened to the face of the old Town\r\nHall with an ingenious structure of steel stays, it has told Guildford\r\nthe time for two centuries and a quarter.\r\n\r\nGuildford High Street has its landmarks of history in its Hospital, its\r\nSchool, and its Town Hall, but its oldest standing record is in one of\r\nits churches. The tower of St. Mary's church, indeed, contains the most\r\nancient piece of building in the town, perhaps in the county.\r\nArchaeologists are to be found who will argue that part of it, at least,\r\nbelongs to the reign of Alfred, though there is little evidence to show\r\nthat stone was used for building in Surrey before the eleventh century.\r\nAlfred, at all events, mentions Guildford in his will; he spells it\r\n\"Guldeford,\" one of the dozen old ways of spelling a name that has\r\nalways been a puzzle and a pleasure to the etymologists. What does\r\nGuildford mean? Naturally \"The Ford of the Guild.\" The town had a guild\r\nof merchants, and there was a ford; nothing could be simpler. But the\r\nsimple explanations are usually wrong; and the most convincing\r\nderivation is one which has been suggested by Mr. Ralph Nevill, who\r\ndiscovered a river named Guilou in Asser's _Deeds of Alfred_, and points\r\nto several other names along the Wey which may be traced to the same\r\nsource. There is Willey House, and Willey Mill near Farnham; Wilsham\r\nFarm near Alton, and Willey Green on another branch of the river.\r\nGuildford, then, is probably the \"ford of the Guilou,\" which in Welsh is\r\npresumably Gwili. Where, then, did the name Wey come from? It may\r\noriginally have been Wye. The corruption would be easy; indeed, Cockney\r\nboating parties very likely get the right pronunciation, by accident,\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nOlder than St. Mary's tower in associations, if not in stone-work, is\r\nGuildford Castle. The Castle stands on a mound, partly natural, perhaps,\r\nand almost certainly partly artificial. Originally, perhaps, the mound\r\nwas used for an early English fortification; it was heightened by\r\nscraping up earth from a ditch at its bottom, and round it was built up\r\na palisade of wood; possibly there was a wooden house on the top of it,\r\nand then it would have looked precisely like one of the fortified mounds\r\nin the Bayeux Tapestry. Later, it was enclosed in a shell keep; later\r\nstill, a Norman square keep was built inside the shell keep; to-day,\r\nexcept the walls of the square keep, almost all the Castle is gone. It\r\nwas never a Castle in much more than name. It has no associations of\r\ngreat battles; it never stood a siege; it never even held a royal\r\nprisoner. In King John's reign it was already used as a gaol, and a gaol\r\nit remained until James I, in 1612, gave it to one Francis Carter of\r\nGuildford, who used it as a private residence. Four hundred years before\r\nit had seen all its fighting. That was when the French Dauphin, invited\r\nby John's angry barons, marched against it and took it from defenders\r\nwho seem to have cared little whether they kept it or not.\r\n\r\nBut the Castle still has its legend--a legend only--of cruelty and\r\nbloody massacre. In 1036, when Harold Harefoot was king, Alfred the son\r\nof Ethelred was travelling from Normandy to join his mother at\r\nWinchester. He landed in Kent, and was marching with his Normans along\r\nthe Way, whether or not with the intention of eventually trying to\r\nrecover his father's kingdom is uncertain; at all events, at Guildford\r\nhe was seized and put to death. So much is history; legend supplies a\r\ndreadful embellishment. Early in the morning after their capture,\r\nAlfred's followers were led out into the street and condemned to death.\r\nNine out of every ten men were butchered, until out of six hundred\r\nNormans sixty only were left alive. That was not enough to glut their\r\ncaptors' fury. The sixty were gone through again, and all but six were\r\nferociously tortured to death. Alfred himself was given to Harold, who\r\nput out his eyes, loaded him with chains, and threw him into prison,\r\nwhere he died. Fortunately, nobody need believe the story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle Gate, Guildford._]\r\n\r\nAn environment of meaner modern buildings has spoiled the setting in\r\nwhich the castle should stand. Seen from certain points, especially from\r\nbelow, the keep is not a very imposing structure; you cannot get far\r\nenough away from it. Far the best view is to be had from the rising\r\nground to the south-east, where you can set the castle in outline\r\nagainst the sky. Then it takes on something of the romance of a Norman\r\nruin, with its tumbling masses of ivy, its broken battlements, and the\r\nmixed greys and ochres of its masonry. The interior is uninteresting,\r\nexcept for the sad little carvings left by prisoners on the walls, among\r\nthem a crucifix, a hermit, St. Catherine's wheel, and St. Christopher.\r\nIf St. Christopher was not exactly the patron saint of prisoners, he was\r\nthe kindliest saint to carve on a dungeon wall. If you looked on St.\r\nChristopher you were safe, at least for that day, from sudden death. How\r\nmany thousand days of \"safety\" he must have brought to the Guildford\r\nprisoners!\r\n\r\nThe castle enceinte is now laid out as a pleasure ground, with all a\r\npublic garden's advantages and disadvantages. Public taste demands\r\n\"bedding out,\" even though geraniums and calceolarias fit unhappily\r\nenough with masonry fourteen feet thick and Saxon earthworks. A bowling\r\ngreen is in its proper place; thorns and old rose-trees have a right to\r\ngrow round ruined castles; wallflowers belong to stones and mortar. But\r\nlobelias do not. Still, something even worse than bedding-out might have\r\nbefallen the Castle grounds. Dr. G.C. Williamson, in his valuable little\r\nbook _Guildford in the Olden Time_, mentions that, when the grounds were\r\nbought for the Corporation in 1886, premiums were offered to various\r\nlandscape gardeners for plans showing the best means of laying out the\r\nspace. One of the plans which was rejected, although attractive in other\r\nways, \"started its schedule of work with a suggestion that the ugly ruin\r\nin the centre of the grounds should be removed, and in lieu of it should\r\nbe erected a light iron bandstand painted green, picked out with gold.\"\r\nWhat, one wonders, were the other attractions of the \"landscape\"?\r\n\r\nJust possibly Guildford Castle was for some time a royal residence.\r\nNearly all the old kings used to visit the country round for hunting and\r\nhawking. Henry II, soon after he came to the throne, enclosed a large\r\ntract of land north of Guildown and made it into a royal park, but\r\nwhether, when he came to hunt, he stayed at the Castle itself or at the\r\npalace which was built in the park, none of the chroniclers say. The\r\npalace has long since disappeared, though it is said that the outline\r\ncan be traced when the land on which it stood is under corn. The corn is\r\nsupposed to turn a different colour along the lines of the foundations.\r\nIn later days, the kings certainly stayed at the palace, and not at the\r\nCastle. John was at Guildford nineteen times in eleven years, and kept\r\nChristmas there in 1200 \"with uncommon splendour and magnificence.\"\r\nHenry III had his wines stored at Guildford, probably in the caverns\r\nnear the Castle, and once, with a capital eye for business, ordered that\r\nno other wines should be sold in the bailiwick of Surrey until his had\r\nfound a buyer. Edward I, according to an untrustworthy story, brought\r\nAdam Gordon, a highway robber, to Guildford after he had fought and\r\nbeaten him with his own royal hands, and forgiven him afterwards. The\r\nnext two Edwards were often at the palace; Henry VI and Edward IV lay\r\nthere; Henry VII made Sir Reginald Bray, ancestor of Surrey's historian,\r\nkeeper of the Park and Manor; Henry VIII hunted in the park, and\r\nElizabeth travelled about so frequently between the royal residences at\r\nGuildford and elsewhere that the county actually framed a remonstrance\r\nagainst having to pay so much for her carriages and horses. She was\r\nprobably the last of the sovereigns to ride through the town from north\r\nto south, though Charles II was feasted there at the Restoration and\r\npresented with a service of plate, a proceeding which swamped the\r\nCorporation in debt.\r\n\r\nOne other distinction Guildford owes to its associations with kings. It\r\nhas been selected as the scene of a remarkable novel by a remarkable\r\nwriter. Martin Tupper, in his preface to _Stephan Langton_, takes a\r\ndevoted public into his confidence as to the manner in which such a book\r\nshould be, and indeed actually was, completed. He set out to write a\r\nhistorical novel dealing with Guildford in the days of King John,\r\nweaving into it various local legends and a love-story of an abbess and\r\nan archbishop; he \"began the book on November 26, 1857, and finished it\r\nin exactly eight weeks, on January 21, 1858, reading for the work\r\nincluded.\" The list of books which he consulted in Mr. Drummond's\r\nlibrary at Albury must be read in full for the mere physical labour of\r\nthe business to be appreciated; but after such abstruse searchings, to\r\nhave crammed into ninety thousand words of solid print such a\r\nconcatenation of murders, arsons, slayings, swoonings, drownings and\r\nburnings must always remain a considerable achievement. The story itself\r\nis sad stuff.\r\n\r\nApart from palaces, Guildford's history, until comparatively recent\r\ntimes, has been the history of the wool trade and cloth manufacture. The\r\nbeginnings of the industry go back to the settlement in the south of\r\nEngland, in the reign of Edward III, of Flemish weavers and dyers.\r\nGuildford naturally attracted the trade, for sheep could be successfully\r\nfarmed on the downs, water-power for the fulling-mills could be had from\r\nthe Wey, and the best fuller's earth in the country was to be had from\r\nNutfield and elsewhere, only a few miles away. The fuller's teazle, and\r\nwoad for dyeing, also grew, and still grow, I learn from Dr. Williamson,\r\nthough I have not found either, in the neighbourhood. Before the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century the cloth industry had come to the dignity of\r\nlegislation. Nobody might buy cloth before it had been \"fulled and fully\r\nperformed in its nature\"; this was to prevent dishonest people from\r\nstretching the cloth and so giving the public short measure. Later,\r\nunder the Tudors, nobody might manufacture cloth except in a market-town\r\nwhere cloth had been manufactured for ten years past. This was no doubt\r\nfor the convenience of the ulnagers, officers deputed to measure and\r\nseal all cloth brought to market. It was highly illegal to stretch cloth\r\nin any way. Thomas West, of Guildford, in 1607, was charged with having\r\nused \"a certain instrument (a tenter) and other engines wherewith 100\r\ncloths of white wool called kerseys, rough and unwrought and made for\r\nsale at Guildford, were stretched and strained in breadth and length.\"\r\nOn another occasion five clothiers were summoned to answer a charge of\r\nhaving used \"a certaine engine called a rope\" to stretch their cloth. So\r\nimportant a part of Guildford's life had clothmaking become under\r\nElizabeth that the Corporation required special acknowledgment of the\r\nfact from the innkeepers, doubtless because prosperity in the town meant\r\nfull tankards emptied at the inns. Every alehouse keeper had to have a\r\nsignboard hung above his door with a woolsack painted on it, under a\r\nfine of six-and-eightpence; he had to buy the sign from the hall warden\r\nat the Town Hall, and pay two shillings for it. Woolsacks were added to\r\nthe borough arms. Yet the prosperity of the trade was short-lived, after\r\nall. The pride of Guildford's industry fell. Less than fifty years after\r\nthe alehouse signs swung woolpacks to guide thirsty clothiers, the\r\nbusiness came down with a run. Godalming, Farnham, and Wonersh were\r\nother flourishing centres of the trade, and in 1630 one Samuel Vassall,\r\nthe merchant who took the Godalming and Wonersh cloth for shipment\r\nabroad, failed his customers. He was under arrest, and no one else could\r\nbe found to take up his contracts. All the Godalming eggs were in one\r\nbasket, and Guildford and Farnham suffered in sympathy. Three thousand\r\nworkers were in distress; it was the beginning of the end. It could not\r\nhave happened, of course, if Samuel Vassall's failure had been the only\r\ndifficulty. That would have been got over somehow. But there was another\r\nagent at work. The real cause of the destruction of the Surrey cloth\r\nindustry was the fact that for years the Company of Merchant Adventurers\r\nand the London Drapers' Company had been working to get the cloth trade\r\ninto their own hands, and they had practically succeeded. Godalming held\r\non for a time; but Guildford, Wonersh, and Farnham went under.\r\n\r\nAubrey is not content with so simple an explanation. He scents a\r\nswindler. The trade of Wonersh, he writes, \"chiefly consisted in making\r\nblue cloth for the Canary Islands; the decay and indeed ruin of their\r\ntrade was their avaricious method of stretching their cloth from 18\r\nyards to 22 or 23, which being discovered abroad, they returned their\r\ncommodity on their hands and it would sell at no market. The same\r\nfraudulent practice caused the decay of the Blews at Guildford.\" He\r\nprobably muddled up musty scandals with the effect of pure business\r\ncompetition. He is not the last to make mistakes connected with a\r\nvanished trade. There still lingers a superstition at Guildford that\r\nRack Close, not far from the Castle, is the place where unfortunate\r\nprisoners (perhaps the Jews whom Martin Tupper describes as suffering\r\nagonies of enforced dentistry and other tortures) were stretched upon\r\nthe rack. It is, of course, the plot of ground on which were set up the\r\nwooden racks, or frames, on which the Guildford blue cloth was stretched\r\nand dried in the wind and sun.\r\n\r\nGuildford was singularly happy in its lack of history during the\r\nParliamentary wars. The battles over Farnham Castle we have seen.\r\nGuildford Castle was not thought worth holding. Surrey gentlemen and\r\nSurrey towns had been as backward as the rest of England in supplying\r\nCharles with his ship-money; but during the whole of the war not a shot\r\nwas fired within hearing of the county capital. There was a question of\r\nsafeguarding the powdermills at Chilworth, and these were secured for\r\nthe Parliamentary Army. Otherwise, Guildford heard nothing more of the\r\nwar than the rattle of accoutrements; there were a few levies stationed\r\nin the town, and a troop or two of horse rode through it. Perhaps\r\nGuildford's unhappiest memory of war is an echo of Sedgmoor, forty years\r\nlater. The Duke of Monmouth, leaving his colliers and ploughmen to do\r\ntheir best against the King's cannon, had ridden off the field into\r\nHampshire, turned his horse loose at Cranbourne Chase, and tried to hide\r\nhimself in some rough ground near Ringwood. Lord Lumley and Sir William\r\nPortman were after him with the Militia; there was a reward of five\r\nthousand pounds on his head, and for a day and a night he was hunted\r\nthrough undergrowth and standing crops. Dogs were run through the high\r\noats and peas, and except oats and peas he had nothing to eat. He was\r\ncaught in the morning, shivering and grey-bearded, in a ditch; two days\r\nlater, he was on his way from Ringwood to London, his coach guarded by\r\nstrong bodies of troops, and sitting opposite him in the coach an\r\nofficer whose orders were to stab him if there was an attempt at rescue.\r\nSo they rode into Guildford on a Saturday afternoon, and that night the\r\nterrified prisoner lay under the roof of Abbot's Hospital. Perhaps he\r\nslept; perhaps he could only stride about the room feverishly scribbling\r\nletters of abject entreaty to the King and the great courtiers; staring\r\nwild-eyed at the early July sunlight beyond the hospital chimneys, and\r\nwondering whether he should see another Sunday dawn. It was his last; on\r\nthe Wednesday morning his head was hacked from his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAbbot's Hospital has pleasanter memories. Foremost must be the memory of\r\nits founder, Guildford's greatest citizen, the stern, kindly old\r\nArchbishop Abbot, son of a poor clothworker of the town, scholar of\r\nBalliol College, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and predecessor\r\nto Laud in the See of Canterbury. It was a great career, and, according\r\nto an old family story, it had a curious beginning. Aubrey gives this\r\nversion:--\r\n\r\n    \"His mother, when she was with child of him, dreamt, that if she\r\n    should eat a _Jack_ or _Pike_, her son in her womb would be a great\r\n    man, upon this she was indefatigable to satisfy her longing, as well\r\n    as her dream: she first enquired out for the fish; but accidentally\r\n    taking up some of the river water (that runs close by the house) in\r\n    a pail, she took up the much desired banquet, dress'd it, and\r\n    devour'd it almost all: This odd affair made no small noise in the\r\n    neighbourhood, and the curiosity of it made several people of\r\n    quality offer themselves to be sponsors at the baptismal fount when\r\n    she was delivered; this their poverty accepted joyfully, and three\r\n    were chosen, who maintained him at school, and at the university\r\n    afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abbot's Hospital, Guildford._]\r\n\r\nThe great archbishop's days ended in gloom. He was shooting deer in Lord\r\nZouch's park at Bramshill, and by an unlucky accident killed a keeper,\r\none Peter Hawkins. Kingsley has pictured the scene:--\r\n\r\n    \"I went the other day\" (he writes in a letter from Eversley) \"to\r\n    Bramshill Park, the home of the _seigneur de pays_ here, Sir John\r\n    Cope. And there I saw the very tree where an ancestor of mine,\r\n    Archbishop Abbot, in James the First's time, shot the keeper by\r\n    accident! I sat under the tree, and it all seemed to me like a\r\n    present reality. I could fancy the noble old man, very different\r\n    then from his picture as it hangs in our dining room at Chelsea. I\r\n    could fancy the deer sweeping by, and the rattle of the cross-bow,\r\n    and the white splinters sparkling off the fated tree as the bolt\r\n    glanced and turned--and then the death shriek, and the stagger, and\r\n    the heavy fall of the sturdy forester--and the bow dropping from the\r\n    old man's hands, and the blood sinking to his heart in one chilling\r\n    rush, and his glorious features collapsing into that look of\r\n    changeless and rigid sorrow, which haunted me in the portrait upon\r\n    the wall in childhood. He never smiled again!\"\r\n\r\nIn those jealous days, an archbishop was not forgiven an accident.\r\nBishops refused to be consecrated by a prelate with blood upon his\r\nhands. A free pardon was granted him; but he never recovered his spirit,\r\nand fasted once a month on Tuesday for the rest of his life. Peter\r\nHawkins's widow was by no means so disconsolate. The Archbishop settled\r\nan annuity of L20 upon her, and she got another husband at once.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop's great legacy is the Hospital. Unlike Whitgift's\r\nHospital at Croydon, it has charming surroundings; like it, it is quiet\r\nand old and solid, of good dark red brick, with mullioned windows and\r\nlatticed panes, four turrets over the entrance gate, and the most\r\ngraceful chimneys that ever carried up smoke from pensioners'\r\nfireplaces. There are many delightful groups of chimneys in Surrey\r\nvillages and on Surrey mansions, but Guildford's chimneys are best of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn summer, the quadrangle is bright with geraniums, and through a\r\npassage opposite the entrance is a glimpse of a simple kitchen garden.\r\nIn it, as one of the pensioners, a white-haired, blue-eyed old man, told\r\nme, vegetables are grown for the inmates of the hospital. I gathered\r\nthat they were not allowed to manage the garden themselves, but that the\r\ngarden produce was divided. But they cook for themselves. The pride of\r\nthe hospital, however, is not the garden, but the old oak of the\r\nstaircases and dining hall and board room, the settle and table, the\r\ncopper caldron and the windows with their punning legend \"Clamamus Abba\r\nPater.\" I am not sure if my old pensioner could read it, but he pointed\r\nit out to me, and when I read it, approved. In the chapel, where there\r\nare a number of Latin verses telling the story of the painted windows,\r\nit was easier for him; he handed me a written explanation. But the\r\nexplanation matters very little; the real thing is the superb colour.\r\nThe story, which is of Jacob, Esau and Laban, is told on two windows,\r\nwith nine lights. There are purples and greens in those windows at which\r\nyou might gaze through a dozen sermons; but there is one robe of\r\nburning, translucent orange that would light a cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe history of these windows would be worth knowing. They were evidently\r\nnot wholly made for the tracery, though parts of them may have been.\r\nAccording to one account, they were purchased by Archbishop Abbot from\r\nthe Dominican Friary which used to stand at the end of Guildford North\r\nStreet, and which was converted into a Manor House after the dissolution\r\nof the monasteries. But the glass belongs to more than one period, and\r\nsome of it was evidently added by the Archbishop, for among the heraldic\r\ndevices above the Jacob and Esau lights are the Abbot arms impaling the\r\nCanterbury arms. Also--a point which the antiquarians have no doubt\r\nnoticed, but I can find no reference to it in any book--the initials\r\nS.R., which appear in the centre top opening of the north window under\r\nthe date 1621, are evidently part of another inscription. On the left\r\nside of the S is part of a V or U, as if the end of a Latin word ending\r\nin \"us\" had had its tail chopped off. The letters must have been\r\nselected from the original inscription for some definite reason; what\r\ncan it have been?\r\n\r\nArchbishop Abbot's bones lie opposite his hospital, in the church of\r\nHoly Trinity. Of the three churches which stand on the High Street,\r\nTrinity Church is the highest up the hill, and was called the Upper\r\nChurch in the days when Puritanism preferred not to mention dedications.\r\nIt is, comparatively speaking, a modern building, red-brick and heavy;\r\nit was built after the old church fell down in 1740. An admirable calm\r\nmust have pervaded the citizens of Guildford on that occasion. Russell,\r\none of Guildford's historians, observes that the inhabitants, \"desirous\r\nof improving\" the church, had recently repaired it at a cost of L750. He\r\nthen adds, reflectively, that \"As the arches and pillars which supported\r\nthe steeple were then taken away, it was soon after supposed to be in a\r\nvery ruinous condition.\" On April 18, 1740, an order was given for the\r\nchurch to be inspected. On the 19th it was inspected, and the steeple\r\nwas reported to be very unsafe. On the 20th, therefore, which was\r\nSunday, service was performed for the last time. On the 23rd the steeple\r\nfell in and took the roof with it; the workmen had left the church a few\r\nminutes before. Even then there was at least one untroubled soul in\r\nGuildford. The verger was told that the steeple had fallen. \"That cannot\r\nbe,\" he replied, \"I have the key in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nThe vault in which the archbishop lies was accidentally opened in 1888,\r\nwhen the church was being repaired, and some brickwork fell away.\r\nThrough the gap, it is said, the coffin could be seen on the floor; the\r\nform of the body was distinct, and the beard was still there. The vault\r\nwas sealed again; it had been unopened for more than two hundred and\r\nfifty years. It was during these alterations that the cenotaph standing\r\nover the vault was removed further east to where it now stands. It is a\r\ntypical piece of Renaissance work, florid, intricate, insistent on the\r\nghastliness of death. The effigy of the archbishop, stern and noble,\r\nlies on its marble bed supported by stacks of gilt-clasped books;\r\nunderneath, a grating reveals a medley of human bones, carved with the\r\nminutest detail. The artist evidently enjoyed the work. But it is better\r\nworth looking at, for all that, than the monument on the other side of\r\nthe church, where the recumbent form of Sir Arthur Onslow is apparently\r\ngiving vague directions to an imaginary audience. Wrapped in a Roman\r\ntoga, he waves a sleeveless right arm; his left is propped by a set of\r\nJournals of the House of Commons. It is a relief to pass beyond such\r\ntawdry pomposities into the solemn little chapel, sacred to one of the\r\ngreat regiments of the Army, the Queen's, the old Second of the Line.\r\nTheir badge, the Lamb and Flag, and their name they get from Katherine\r\nof Braganza, Charles the Second's queen. Later, as Kirke's Lambs, they\r\nadded to a dreadful fame at Sedgmoor; but rebellion breeds brutality,\r\nand Kirke was probably no more ferocious than others who have had to\r\ndeal with insurgents. Since Sedgmoor, the Queen's, or to give them their\r\nother and less distinctive name, the Royal West Surrey Regiment, have\r\nserved in practically every important campaign in which the Army has\r\nbeen engaged. Their tattered banners, with the broken, proud\r\ninscriptions of campaigns and battles, droop above long lists of dead.\r\n\r\nOf the two other great Guildford churches, the lower, or Church of St.\r\nNicholas, stands at the bottom of the High Street on the far side of the\r\nWey. Probably it is the fourth church that has stood on this site; there\r\nare at all events, records of three previous demolitions, though each\r\ndemolition has left one feature standing--the Loseley Chapel, belonging\r\nto the Mores of Loseley Park. With the exception of this chapel, with\r\nits brasses and monuments, dating back to the fourteenth century\r\nmemorial of Arnold Brocas of Beaurepaire (surely a name of names!), the\r\nchurch is chiefly interesting as being a really satisfying piece of\r\nmodern architecture. It was built in 1875, and, though the interior,\r\nwith its modern glass and high colouring, has none of the quiet of age,\r\nit dulls to the right tone at dusk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Mary's Church, Guildford._]\r\n\r\nThe Middle Church, St. Mary's, is the most interesting of the three. The\r\ntower was built before the Conquest, possibly originally for defence: at\r\nall events, there are two windows looking north and south which are\r\ndoubly splayed, after Saxon fashion, a good deal above the ground\r\nlevel. The rest of the church has been built at different times,\r\nbeginning with the chancel, which is pure Norman, and there are actually\r\nthree levels to the floor, which gives rather an odd effect. The\r\nproportions of the church have been spoiled by the cutting off of the\r\napse of the chancel--an entirely unwarrantable piece of destruction. The\r\nhistory of the mutilation is characteristic of the days of the Regency.\r\nGeorge, Prince of Wales, used to drive down to Brighton, and perhaps his\r\ncoach stuck in Quarry Street, which must have been horribly narrow,\r\nbetween the apse of St. Mary's and the town gaol opposite. He swore as a\r\nGeorgian prince should, offered the town a good round sum to have the\r\nstreet widened, and the Corporation, who could have sliced something off\r\nthe gaol and harmed nobody, preferred to cut at the church. They never\r\ngot a penny of George's money.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting feature of St. Mary's is the group of\r\nwall-paintings in the chapel of St. John, north of the nave. These are\r\nsecond in importance only to the famous painting at Chaldon, and have\r\nbeen admirably explained by Mr. J.G. Waller, writing in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_. They belong to that curious age when\r\npaintings on church walls were used as texts and preached from on\r\nSundays, to be scratched and whitewashed out of recognition in later\r\nyears by destroyers and \"restorers\" alike. The subjects chosen by the\r\npainter in St. Mary's Church are peculiar and strangely grouped. The\r\ncentre of the group is a \"Majesty,\" the conventional representation of\r\nthe second coming of Christ. The head of the Christ has its nimbus; that\r\nHe is \"in his glory\" you can see by the mantle of royal purple, and \"the\r\nholy angels with Him\" are represented by two little cramped figures, set\r\napart to make room for other drawings. Altogether there are six\r\nmedallions besides the \"Majesty,\" and there are also designs in the\r\nspandrils above the arch, but these are separate from the subjects of\r\nthe medallions. The medallions, Mr. Waller explains, represent certain\r\nscenes in the lives of John the Baptist, and John the Evangelist, though\r\nonly two of the stories depicted belong to the Bible. One of them, next\r\nto the \"Majesty,\" shows the Evangelist seated in a caldron of boiling\r\noil, in which he is being held by a hideous tormentor with a pitchfork,\r\nwhile a seated figure of Christ confers protection upon the Saint. In\r\nanother medallion the Evangelist is seen raising to life the dead\r\nDrusiana, a lady of Ephesus who died just before the Apostle came to the\r\ncity; he is also shown turning sticks and stones into gold and jewels,\r\nwhich he did in illustration of a sermon preached against riches. In a\r\nthird medallion the Saint drinks harmlessly from a chalice of poison\r\nwhich has just killed two malefactors dead at his feet; and in a fourth\r\nthe other John, the Baptist, is painted with a rope round his neck,\r\ndragged by an executioner before Herod. The executioner next beheads the\r\nsaint, and evidently sees some terrible portent on doing so, for his\r\nhair stands on end, and his hand flies up in horror. The two other\r\nmedallions are separate subjects. In one, a figure with a rope round his\r\nneck is dragged before Christ by demons; other demons, one red and one\r\nwhite, scream and hold out threatening claws; perhaps their question is\r\n\"Art Thou come hitherto torment us before the time?\" The other subject\r\nis obscure. A Jew, apparently, is being baptised; and a deed with seals\r\nis being examined by another figure, over a stream of water and blood.\r\nMr. Waller thinks that the reference is to a legend of a Jew who\r\ndesecrated an image of Christ with a spear, in imitation of the story of\r\nthe crucifixion, when out of the wound there gushed a stream of blood\r\nand water. This miracle converted the Jew and his friends, who\r\nimmediately made over their synagogue to the Christian Church. That\r\nwould explain the sealed deed.\r\n\r\nOther paintings in the spandrils--pictures of Soul-weighing and\r\nPunishment--belong to other theologies. St. Michael holds the balance,\r\nand a demon tries to press down one of the scales so that the soul being\r\nweighed may kick the beam. But the subject of the painting is, of\r\ncourse, older than St. Michael. The doctrine that souls are weighed, and\r\nthat devils and angels strive for the possession of them, is one of the\r\noldest in the history of the world's religions. It finds a place in all\r\nthe creeds; it belongs to Brahminism, to Buddhism, to Mahommedanism; it\r\nis identical with the Ritual of the Dead of Egyptian mythology, in which\r\nthe souls of men are weighed before Osiris, and pray for mercy as they\r\nare weighed. As at Chaldon, in another part of the painting the\r\ncondemned souls are being taken away. A demon carries them off, tied up\r\nin a bundle, to the fires of hell. Doubtless the Guildford\r\ncongregations, listening Sunday after Sunday to the exposition of such\r\npotent texts, came to have little taste for theology that was not served\r\nup hot and strong.\r\n\r\nGuildford has had other teachers besides theologians. The school, a\r\ngrey, venerable building, which fronts on the High Street above Trinity\r\nChurch, is the oldest in the county. It was founded in 1509, by one\r\nRobert Beckingham, a rich London grocer, who owned property in\r\nGuildford. But his benefactions did not permit any great latitude in\r\nbuilding, and it was not until Edward VI had given the school a charter\r\nand a grant, and other great Guildford men had provided funds for\r\nbuilding and endowment, that the school, nearly at the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, found itself in full working order. Since then it has\r\neducated some famous scholars. Guildford's greatest man, George Abbot,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury; his brother, Robert Abbot, Bishop of\r\nSalisbury; another brother, Sir Maurice Abbot, Lord Mayor of London;\r\nJohn Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich; Henry Cotton, Bishop of Norwich, and\r\nhis brother, William Cotton, Bishop of Exeter; Arthur Onslow, Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons; Richard Valpy, author of the Greek grammar; and\r\nSir George Grey, the Colonial statesman, Governor in 1846 of New Zealand\r\nand in 1855 of the Cape, are among its distinguished pupils. Of late\r\nyears, perhaps, Charterhouse has drained away some of the supply of\r\nfuture Abbots and Onslows. But the school still flourishes, and the\r\nmemory of its \"great\" headmaster, Dr. Merriman, is kept green by\r\nmiddle-aged Guildfordians.\r\n\r\nGuildford's inns have been famous for centuries. Guildford is the only\r\ntown in Surrey which Camden mentions in his _Britannia_, as having good\r\ninns; John Aubrey remarks that they are \"the best perhaps in England;\r\nthe Red Lion particularly can make fifty beds, the White Hart was not so\r\nbig, but has more noble rooms.\" John Taylor, the Water Poet, in his\r\n_Catalogue of Taverns in Ten Shires near London_, made in 1636, goes out\r\nof his way to mention particularly that Guildford \"hath very faire Innes\r\nand good entertainment at the Tavernes, the Angell, the Crowne, the\r\nWhite hart, and the Lyon\"; and Guildford only, of all the towns he\r\nmentions, has all its inns either still standing or represented under\r\nthe same names, wholly or partially rebuilt. The Angel has kept more of\r\nwhat is old than the others, including a panelled hall with a\r\nseventeenth century clock, and some fine timber and brickwork best seen\r\nfrom the inn yard. Under the Angel, too, lies one of a pair of vaulted\r\ncrypts which have puzzled all the archaeologists. The two crypts lie on\r\nopposite sides of the street, and are beautiful examples of fourteenth\r\ncentury work in chalk; in one of them, too, there was evidently once\r\nsome fresco work, but that has nearly all been rubbed away. What were\r\nthe crypts for? No one knows for certain. Mr. Thackeray Turner thinks\r\nthey were without doubt the undercrofts of merchants' houses; but there\r\nis better reason for supposing that they are remains of some religious\r\nfoundation, perhaps of White Friars. At one time there stood in the\r\ncentre of the High Street, between the two crypts, the \"Fyshe Crosse,\"\r\nwhich John Russell, the Guildford historian, tells us carried on its\r\nsummit a flying angel carved in stone, and was erected by the White\r\nFriars in 1345. There is no evidence to prove that this was so, though\r\nit may have been; in any case, the \"Fyshe Crosse\" was demolished in 1595\r\nas being abominably in the way of the street traffic. If the White\r\nFriars ever had a convent near the cross, possibly the Angel was\r\noriginally their guest-house, afterwards turned into an inn.\r\n\r\nThe Red Lion was the best inn, according to Pepys. It was at the Red\r\nLion that he \"lay in the room the King lately lay in,\" which would have\r\npleased Pepys; and it was with the drawers of the inn, one Saturday\r\nnight, that he and Mr. Creed made merry over the minister of the town,\r\nwho had a girdle as red as his face, but preached next day a better\r\nsermon than Pepys had looked for. The inn had a garden, out of which on\r\nanother occasion the gossiping little Admiralty official cut \"sparagus\r\nfor supper--the best that ever I ate but in the house last year.\"\r\nDoubtless the host of the Red Lion liked Pepys's recommendation, but\r\nPepys and his wife must have occasionally been rather noisy guests. It\r\nwas in the same inn garden that he and Mr. Creed \"played the fool a\r\ngreat while, trying who could go best over the edge of an old fountain\r\nwell; and I won a quart of sack of him.\" Afterwards, at supper, \"my wife\r\nand I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a\r\nbeauty) till we were both angry.\" Pepys's journeys to Portsmouth, where\r\nhis Admiralty business took him, seem generally to have been broken at\r\nGuildford, which was the first stopping place after leaving \"Fox Hall\"\r\nas he calls Vauxhall. The roads must have been pretty bad, for on one\r\noccasion the coach lost its way for \"three or four miles\" about Cobham.\r\nHowever, they ended as usual at the Red Lion, and \"dined together, and\r\npretty merry\" and so back to Fox Hall.\r\n\r\nA gentler traveller through Guildford used to drive along the Hog's Back\r\nin the early morning, breakfast at the Lion or the Angel, and reach\r\nSloane Street at half-past six or so in the evening, when she was glad\r\nto get to bed early. That was when Jane Austen was writing at Chawton.\r\nOne of her letters, very typical of her in its regard for the pleasant\r\nlittle minutiae of a day's business, describes a drive from Chawton up to\r\nLondon. At Guildford she was \"very lucky in my gloves--got them at the\r\nfirst shop I went to, though I went into it rather because it was near\r\nthan because it looked like a shop, and gave only four shillings for\r\nthem; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting\r\nthat they cannot be good for anything.\" She was then at work on _Emma_,\r\nwhom we meet again at Leatherhead.\r\n\r\nGuildford High Street has kept its main features for centuries. But the\r\ntown has lost one of its chief buildings, which only survives in the\r\nname of Friary Street, and in one or two other names, such as Walnut\r\nTree Close. This was the old Dominican Friary probably founded by Black\r\nFriars in the first half of the thirteenth century. Not a stone of the\r\nold Friary remains in its place, but the building saw in its time a good\r\ndeal of Guildford history. Prince Henry, the eldest son of Edward I and\r\nEleanor of Castile, died there of an illness which not even the skill of\r\nthe friars could abate, though they tried their utmost and sent\r\nmessengers riding to London for syrups and candies. The friars had a\r\ngood deal to do with royalty, and had many presents from the kings.\r\nEdward I gave them oak trees for fuel and timber; Edward II gave them\r\neight shillings; Henry IV and his family lodged with them and gave them\r\nforty shillings; Henry VII let them gather fallen wood in his park, but\r\nnever gave them a penny; Henry VIII gave them many presents, of which\r\nthe largest were two of five pounds, and his daughter, Princess Mary,\r\ngave them seven shillings and sixpence. But the friary fell, of course,\r\nat the Dissolution and after that, apparently, Henry used the building,\r\nwhich he enlarged, for his own purposes when he came to Guildford to\r\nhunt. Later, probably before the time of James I, the old friary\r\nbuildings were demolished and another house built which went with the\r\nGuildford Park estate through several families. One of its owners was\r\nDaniel Colwall, a founder of the Royal Society, who conferred on its\r\nannals the dismal distinction of a suicide. He pistolled himself in an\r\narmchair, and the chair is still shown, black with blood, in the\r\nmaster's quarters of the Abbot's Hospital. Later still, the house was\r\nused as cavalry barracks, and three years after Waterloo, when perhaps\r\nbarracks seemed less necessary than before, the buildings were pulled to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nGuildford once had nine \"gates\"; eight have disappeared. They are marked\r\non an old map of the borough, classically described as the \"Ichnography\r\nor ground plan of Guildford.\" Of six \"gates\" or streets south of the\r\nHigh Street, Ratsgate, Bookersgate, Tunsgate, Saddlersgate, Bakersgate,\r\nand Shipgate, only Tunsgate remains; and on the north side Swangate,\r\nBull's Head Gate, and Coffeehouse Gate have vanished. The charm of the\r\nchief buildings remains, but here and there modern needs have spoiled\r\nthe smaller houses. In the High Street, for instance, Number 25, not\r\nmuch more than a hundred years ago, must have been a quite perfect\r\nlittle house, with its large casements and their curious iron\r\nfastenings, its noble staircase, and its delightful doorway. It was once\r\nthe private residence of the Martyr family, who were hereditary town\r\nclerks of Guildford, but unfortunately it has now been turned into a\r\nshop. The proprietor very courteously allows visitors to examine the\r\ninterior, but much of the fascination of the ground floor, with its\r\npanels under the windows and its delicate iron railing, has vanished\r\naltogether, and can only be recovered in imagination with the help of an\r\nold drawing. This house, by the way, a century ago contained a strange\r\nrelic, strangely lost. When Peter de Rupibus, the great Bishop of\r\nWinchester, died at his castle at Farnham, his body was buried in\r\nWinchester Cathedral, but the heart was taken to Waverley Abbey. About\r\n1730 it was accidentally dug up among the Abbey ruins, and brought to\r\nGuildford, where Mr. John Martyr kept it at Number 25, safe in its\r\noriginal lead case. A hundred years later the heart disappeared. No one\r\nknows how it vanished, or where it lies.\r\n\r\nOne building has altered very little. That is the old town hall, whose\r\nclock swings out over the road, and has been sketched more often,\r\nperhaps, than any clock in Surrey. The original town hall belongs to the\r\ntime of Elizabeth, and was probably built into the present structure,\r\nwhich dates from 1683. It is in some ways the chief feature of the High\r\nStreet, with its heavy balcony, supported by monstrous black oak\r\nbrackets, and its cupola and bell-turret. The clock has a separate\r\nhistory. In the year when the town hall was built, one John Aylward, a\r\nclockmaker, came to Guildford and asked leave to set up in business. He\r\nwas a \"foreigner,\" that is, he came from another part of England, and\r\nthe Gild-merchant refused permission. Undaunted, he retired and set up\r\nhis shop outside the borough, made a great clock, presented it to the\r\ngoverning body, and so obtained the freedom of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nGUILDFORD'S ENVIRONS\r\n\r\n    The prettiest town Cobbett ever saw.--Semaphores and the THING.--The\r\n    Road on the Ridge.--Newlands Corner.--The Father of the\r\n    Forest.--Pilgrims to St. Martha's.--A quiet churchyard.--Mr.\r\n    Allnutt's poem.--St. Catherine's and the\r\n    Hammer.--Worplesdon.--Sutton Place.--The Weston Rebus.--Lady Susan,\r\n    the Tame Wild Sow.--The earliest mention of Cricket.\r\n\r\n\r\nCobbett's is the most attractive description of Guildford and its\r\nenvirons. \"The town of Guildford,\" he writes in _Rural Rides_, \"taken\r\nwith its environs I, who have seen so many, many towns, think the\r\nprettiest, and, taken all together, the most agreeable and most\r\nhappy-looking that I ever saw in my life. Here are hill and dale in\r\nendless variety. Here are the chalk and the sand, vieing with each other\r\nin making beautiful scenes. Here is a navigable river and fine meadows.\r\nHere are woods and downs. Here is something of everything but _fat\r\nmarshes_ and their skeleton-making _agues_. The vale all the way down to\r\nChilworth from Reigate is very delightful.\" He has as many praises for\r\nthe neighbourhood on the other side. \"Everybody that has been from\r\nGodalming to Guildford knows that there is hardly another such a pretty\r\nfour miles in all England. The road is good; the soil is good; the\r\nhouses are neat; the people are neat; the hills, the woods, the meadows,\r\nall are beautiful. Nothing wild or bold, to be sure, but exceedingly\r\npretty; and it is almost impossible to ride along these four miles\r\nwithout feelings of pleasure, though you have rain for your companion,\r\nas it happened to be with me.\" Would the scenery have pleased Cobbett\r\nbetter if it had been \"wild or bold\"? Probably not, since he calls\r\nHindhead \"the most villainously ugly spot on God's Earth.\" Cobbett liked\r\nsmiling pastures and well grown crops. His prettiness is good timber\r\nand clean farming.\r\n\r\nIn Cobbett's time, there were no suburbs to Guildford; to-day the\r\nsuburbs grow. Pewley Hill, south-east of the town, which old pictures of\r\nGuildford show you bare downland, is hardly so much spotted as hidden by\r\nundistinguished villas and dreary brick. Perhaps it would please Cobbett\r\nas well as it pleased him ninety years ago. Pewley Hill in his day stood\r\nnaked to the wind, except for the semaphore and its buildings, and\r\nCobbett deeply hated the semaphore. To us, who have the telephone and\r\ntelegram, there seems nothing hateful in it (unless we hate the\r\ntelephone), but to Cobbett the line of semaphore towers between London\r\nand Portsmouth stood for all that was dreadful in war, debt, jobbery and\r\nalarums. He could see nothing attractive in the cleverness and despatch\r\nof a system which enabled news to be sent from London to Portsmouth in a\r\nfew seconds. (It took three-quarters of a minute to signal the hour of\r\none o'clock from Greenwich to Portsmouth and back again to Greenwich).\r\nAll he saw was bloody war and money wrongly spent. Thus, of one of the\r\nline:--\r\n\r\n\"This building is, it seems, called a _Semaphore_, or _Semiphare_, or\r\nsomething of that sort. What this word may have been hatched out of I\r\ncannot say; but it means _a job_, I am sure. To call it an _alarm-post_\r\nwould not have been so convenient; for, people not endued with Scotch\r\n_intellect_, might have wondered why the d---- we should have to pay for\r\nalarm-posts and might have thought that with all our 'glorious\r\nvictories' we had 'brought our hogs to a fine market' if our dread of\r\nthe enemy were such as to induce us to have alarm-posts all over the\r\ncountry!\" The semaphore north of the road from Guildford to Farnham\r\nurges him to even higher flights:--\r\n\r\n\"What can this be _for_? Why are these expensive things put up all over\r\nthe country? Respecting the movements of _whom_ is wanted this _alarm\r\nsystem_? Will no member ask this in Parliament? Not one! not a man: and\r\nyet it is a thing to ask about. Ah! it is in vain, THING, that you thus\r\nare _making your preparations_; in vain that you are setting your\r\ntrammels! The DEBT, the blessed debt, that best ally of the people, will\r\nbreak them all; will snap them, as the hornet does the cobweb; and even\r\nthese very 'Semaphores' contribute towards the force of that ever\r\nblessed debt.\"\r\n\r\nSemaphore House still stands upon Pewley Hill, a modern villa; opposite\r\nit, which would infuriate the old reformer if he could see it, War\r\nOffice Ground, marked off with barbed wire and minatory notice-boards. A\r\nhundred years hence, perhaps the fort on Pewley Hill will be exhibited\r\nas one of the curiosities of nineteenth-century Guildford.\r\n\r\nPewley Hill is dull enough in itself to-day, when the down grass has\r\ngone and the bricks are multiplying, but it leads to some of the wildest\r\nand oldest and sweetest of all scenes in the county. You must go over\r\nPewley Hill to come to the downs, and the downs between Guildford and\r\nNetley, by Newlands Corner, above Albury and Chilworth, are for me, at\r\nall events, the loveliest spot in Surrey. There are other heights in\r\nSurrey with wider views of scenery; there is Hindhead with its almost\r\ncomplete circle of horizon, from Nettlebed by Henley to the Devil's Dyke\r\nabove Brighton; there is the road above Reigate, which looks out over a\r\nthousand roofs and miles of well farmed fields; and there is Leith Hill,\r\nthe highest of all hills in south eastern England. But the stretch of\r\ndownland running from Guildford to Newlands Corner has a charm that\r\nbelongs to none of these. It is not merely the peace and sunshine of the\r\nbroad path along the ridge, with its downland flowers and Chalk Hill\r\nBlue butterflies; not only the width and extent of the view over the\r\nWeald, though it is of all views in Surrey one of the loveliest--unlike\r\nthe flatter panoramas of Leith Hill and Reigate in that it is a view not\r\nonly of fields and meadows, but of tree-clad hills, shouldering into\r\nfainter greens and greys away to Hampshire and Sussex. The enchantment\r\nis something else; the closeness of touch with so much that is dim and\r\nold; the nearness of so much that cannot be reached in changing towns,\r\non modern roads. For this is unchanged, untouched, unsoiled, part of the\r\ngreat Way that brought the merchants of Cornwall riding to the Roman\r\nport of Rutupiae in the Isle of Thanet with tin mined in the\r\nCassiterides. The valley below may have changed from forest to meadow\r\nand plough, but the green road along the ridge remains what it was\r\nbefore ever it felt a Roman wheel. No fresher air nor clearer sunlight\r\nlies on any Surrey downs than on those broad aisles of shaven turf,\r\nlichened whitethorns and wind-bent yews.\r\n\r\nNewlands Corner has seen more than one battle. Mr. St. Loe Strachey,\r\neditor of the _Spectator_, and one of the earliest founders of rifle\r\nclubs in the country, has his home on the downs close by, and Newlands\r\nCorner, the centre of the rifle clubs of Surrey, has been the scene of\r\nassaults and the counter-attacks made by Volunteer cyclists against\r\ndefending bands of riflemen. The riflemen have held their own under the\r\nseverest fire; Ministers and distinguished soldiers have watched them.\r\n\r\nOn the downs by Newlands Corner, near the great trackway of the trading\r\nBritons, stand some of the finest yews in England. To one of a group of\r\ntrees, a monarch whose descendants count their centuries in a ring about\r\nhim, belongs a noble poem. Mr. William Watson, under the shade of its\r\nbranches, wrote _The Father of the Forest_. These are the opening\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    Old emperor Yew, fantastic sire,\r\n      Girt with thy guard of dotard kings,--\r\n    What ages hast thou seen retire\r\n      Into the dusk of alien things?\r\n    What mighty news hath stormed thy shade,\r\n    Of armies perished, realms unmade?\r\n\r\n    Already wast thou great and wise,\r\n      And solemn with exceeding eld,\r\n    On that proud morn when England's rays,\r\n      Wet with tempestuous joy, beheld\r\n    Round her rough coasts the thundering main\r\n    Strewn with the ruined dream of Spain.\r\n\r\n    Hardly thou count'st them long ago,\r\n      The warring faiths, the wavering land,\r\n    The sanguine sky's delirious glow,\r\n      And Cranmer's scorched, uplifted hand.\r\n    Wailed not the woods their task of shame,\r\n    Doomed to provide the insensate flame?\r\n\r\n    Mourned not the rumouring winds, when she,\r\n      The sweet queen of a tragic hour,\r\n    Crowned with her snow-white memory\r\n      The crimson legend of the Tower?\r\n    Or when a thousand witcheries lay\r\n    Felled with one stroke, at Fotheringay?\r\n\r\n    Ah, thou hast heard the iron tread\r\n      And clang of many an armoured age,\r\n    And well recall'st the famous dead,\r\n      Captains or counsellors brave or sage,\r\n    Kings that on kings their myriads hurled,\r\n    Ladies whose smile embroiled the world.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims' road, as I have tried to show elsewhere, separates from\r\nthe Way again at Guildford. The old British track probably kept to the\r\nnorthern ridge; the pilgrims who visited Guildford may have left by the\r\nsame road, but they turned away across the valley to the little chapel\r\nof St. Martha, which stands on a hill two miles south-east of the town.\r\nThe pilgrim's track to the chapel, vanished in parts, becomes plain\r\nenough when it crosses the road which now runs from Guildford to\r\nChilworth west of the chapel by perhaps half a mile. Here it is a wide\r\nsmooth path of the finest down grass, cropped close by rabbits, with\r\nwhich all this breezy hill must be alive by night. Nearly at the top the\r\npath breaks into sand, which must have tested the less elastic of the\r\ntravellers to the shrine pretty severely, but the sand breaks again into\r\nan open plateau of as fine grass as the path below. On this plateau\r\nstands the little church, alone in the sun and wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Catherine's Chapel, Guildford._]\r\n\r\nSixty years ago St. Martha's was a ruin; as unhappy a little building as\r\nSt. Catherine's on the hill beyond the Wey. It was restored in 1848, and\r\nhas taken out of the past a quiet and serenity that set it in the old\r\nyears, in tranquil sunshine, in the peace of English Sundays. All the\r\nwinds blow about it; it is alone in its acre of smooth down grass;\r\nwithin its churchyard wall are the graves of country labourers and their\r\nchildren, lowly mounds hardly seen, without the memory of a name, at one\r\nwith the purpose of the earth they dug and sowed. Pine trees stand round\r\nthe open space of the hill; bluebells in May spread a film under them;\r\nbeyond the grasses, heather and ling die from August purples to the\r\nbronze of autumn. The Surrey hills are to the south and west; farthest\r\non the horizon is the faint blue of the Sussex downs.\r\n\r\nThere are early Norman walls and arches in the restored chapel. St.\r\nMartha's may be one of the three churches which Domesday assigns to the\r\nmanor of Bramley, belonging to Bishop Odo of Bayeux. A less trustworthy\r\ntradition is that Stephen Langton is buried there; the lids of the old\r\nstone coffins found in the chapel when it was restored probably account\r\nfor that legend. Martin Tupper accepted the legend as history.\r\n\r\nSt. Martha's chapel has inspired more than one poet, Tupper among them,\r\nbut none have written with more charm on the lonely little building than\r\nMr. Sidney Allnutt, in a poem which was published in the _Spectator_\r\nlast year. Here are six stanzas out of many:--\r\n\r\n    A little chapel grey with years,\r\n    And bleached with sun and rain,\r\n    One solid four-square tower it rears\r\n    Above strong walls which still oppose\r\n    Firm front to elemental foes\r\n    That rage at them in vain.\r\n\r\n    Far southward from St. Martha's Hill,\r\n    And to the east and west,\r\n    The downs heave up green shoulders, till\r\n    The distance with its magic blue\r\n    Envelops every other hue,\r\n    And crest is lost in crest.\r\n\r\n    Safe sheltered by the encircling downs\r\n    The chequered valleys show\r\n    Their tapestry of greens and browns,\r\n    Made rich by fields of golden grain,\r\n    And threaded by a silver vein\r\n    Where Wey's clear waters flow.\r\n\r\n    A churchyard bare of shrub or tree,\r\n    All open to the sky,\r\n    To every wind of heaven free,\r\n    Lies round the chapel, carpeted\r\n    With soft, sweet turf where happy dead\r\n    In dreamless slumber lie.\r\n\r\n    For, far removed from camp or mart,\r\n    Beneath the sacred sod\r\n    Of that blest hill they sleep apart:\r\n    Forgotten by the world below,\r\n    After life's spendthrift toil they know\r\n    The rest that comes from God.\r\n\r\n    And, oh, it must be good to sleep\r\n    Within that churchyard bare,\r\n    While turn by turn the seasons keep\r\n    A bedside watch, and God may see\r\n    Safe in St. Martha's nursery\r\n    His children pillowed there.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose a month and an hour to visit St. Martha's, it would\r\nbe an evening late in April with the trees in the valley at their\r\nfreshest and the song of blackbirds about the hill. Others, perhaps,\r\nwould choose an August day, with the wind scented and the hill purpled\r\nwith heather; perhaps, too, in August the rabbit-cropped turf is\r\nsmoothest and greenest. Others may find the chief beauty of the hill in\r\nthe bronze and yellow of the changing leaves of October; there are no\r\nhills where the beech glows with a deeper fire than over Albury and the\r\nTillingbourne. Others even might ask for the vague, wet airs of\r\nmidwinter, with the shouldering hilltops east and south and west faint\r\nand mysterious in the clinging mist, and never a house-roof to be seen.\r\nThat is an effect of strange loneliness; but the abiding charm of St.\r\nMartha's is the peace of clear air, in the enchantment of low spring\r\nsunlight on the down turf and the quiet walls.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw a remarkable sight by St. Martha's. Incongruously enough, the\r\nwooded hillsides below the chapel are preserved as game-coverts; indeed,\r\npheasants are shot quite close to the churchyard. There are rides cut\r\nthrough the wood in which broods of young pheasants are fed by their\r\nfostermothers' coops; and looking down one of these rides on a day early\r\nin August, I watched for some time a curious collection of birds\r\nfeeding together in front of the coops. There were the young pheasants,\r\nof course, there was quite a crowd of small birds, finches chiefly, but\r\na few thrushes and hedge-sparrows; there were seven or eight\r\nturtle-doves, five jays, and, queerest of all companions for doves and\r\npheasants, a carrion crow. I thought at first he must be a rook, but\r\nthere was no doubt about it. I looked up as I walked away, and over me\r\nsailed five herring gulls, high and slow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Martha's Chapel._]\r\n\r\nSt. Catherine's chapel, on the other side of Guildford, has not the same\r\nlonely charm as St. Martha's. It has never, like St. Martha's, been\r\nrestored, and the hill on which it stands is sacred to nobody. Children\r\nclimb about its walls and windows; cockneys scratch their names, and\r\npicnic parties bestrew the grass with paper. Yet St. Catherine's, in the\r\ndays before pilgrimages ceased and shrines were left to moulder, perhaps\r\nheard as many Aves as her sister chapel on the hill beyond the Way. A\r\ncountry legend is common to both chapels. St. Catherine and St. Martha,\r\nin the wonderful days of the giants, were sisters who built chapels on\r\nneighbouring hills. They had but one hammer between them, and they\r\nhurled it high over the valley one to another, St. Martha catching it\r\nfrom St. Catherine, driving in a nail and hurling it back again.\r\n\r\nNorth of Guildford to the west is Worplesdon Common, a stretch of\r\nheathery, rushy ground over which have gone many marches and\r\nmanoeuvres, and north of the common is the home of Mr. Frederick\r\nSelous, the African traveller and naturalist. Mr. Selous throws his\r\ncollection of trophies open to the public for a small sum, and his\r\ngarden is known to the readers of the _Field_ as the home of rare and\r\nshy birds. The owner has described, with callous disregard of the\r\nfeelings of less fortunate ornithologists, the nesting operations among\r\nhis bird boxes of half a dozen nuthatches.\r\n\r\nTo the north-east, a mile from the main road from Guildford to Ripley,\r\nis Sutton Place, perhaps the finest piece of domestic architecture in\r\nthe south of England. Mr. Frederic Harrison has described it at length\r\nin his _Annals of an Old Manor House_. It was built by Sir Richard\r\nWeston about 1525. The architect is unknown, but the house is peculiarly\r\ninteresting, partly because it is the best example of the use of terra\r\ncotta in the moulding combined with brickwork, and partly because it is\r\none of the earliest houses in England built as a country home rather\r\nthan a castle. Sir Richard Weston, the founder, was one of the ablest\r\nservants and greatest friends of Henry VIII, the more astonishing a\r\nfriendship in that it was never broken. Henry VIII sent his friend's son\r\nto the scaffold, accused as a lover of Anne Boleyn; he went to the block\r\nprotesting his innocence, and there was nothing to prove him guilty; his\r\nlast words were a defence of the queen. His son, a baby when his boyish\r\nfather was executed, married the daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell. Sir\r\nThomas had suffered for treason, so that husband and wife were the\r\nchildren of parents who had been sent to the block. They entertained\r\nElizabeth at Sutton; she would have a child's memory of the founder of\r\nthe house, and doubtless praised the rebus in the terra cotta moulding,\r\nthe \"R.W.,\" the grapes and the tun.\r\n\r\nLater representatives of the Westons at Sutton were the Salvin family,\r\nand it was one of these Salvins, I imagine, to whom Frank Buckland\r\nrefers in his edition of White's _Selborne_. Captain Salvin lived at\r\nWhitmoor House, near Guildford, and was the happy owner of a tame wild\r\nsow. Lady Susan was her name, and this is how her master describes\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n    \"My sow originally came from Syria, and was given to me by H.H. the\r\n    Maharajah Duleep Singh. She is a remarkably fine healthy animal,\r\n    and her instinct and affection can only be equalled by the dog. She\r\n    follows me almost daily in my walks like a dog, to the great\r\n    astonishment of strangers. Of course I only take her out before the\r\n    crops are up, and too low to injure, during the spring and summer\r\n    months. I always have her belled, to hear when she is in the wood,\r\n    etc.; and the bell, which is a good sheep's bell, is fastened round\r\n    her neck with a strap and a buckle.\r\n\r\n    \"Her leaping powers are extraordinary, either over water or timber;\r\n    indeed, only a few weeks since she cleared some palings (between\r\n    which she had been purposely placed to secure her for a time) three\r\n    feet ten inches in height. Knowing my pig's excellent temper, even\r\n    when she has young pigs, and when domestic sows are always most\r\n    savage, I was once guilty of a practical joke. I got a blacksmith\r\n    who was quite ignorant of even the existence of my pig, to 'come and\r\n    ring a pig.' The stye being under a building, he had to enter it at\r\n    a low door, which was some distance from the sow's yard, where she\r\n    was feeding. He entered, shutting the door to keep the pig in, and\r\n    thinking his subject was an ordinary one and that assistants were\r\n    following him to hold the cord, etc. He had not been gone a minute,\r\n    before I heard the greatest 'rum-ti-tum' at the door, and cries of\r\n    'For goodness' sake, sir, let me out! let me out! I never saw such a\r\n    beast in all my life!' and out came the poor blacksmith pale with\r\n    fright, but all the consolation he got was a jolly good laugh at his\r\n    own expense.\"\r\n\r\nAll English cricket owes a debt to Guildford. It is in the annals of\r\nGuildford that there occurs the first known mention of the game of\r\n\"crickett.\" In 1598 there was a dispute over the rights of a plot of\r\nland near the north town ditch, and \"John Derrick, gent., one of the\r\nQueen's Majestie's coroners of the county of Surrey, aged fifty-nine\"\r\nwas called to give evidence. He stated that he had known the land for\r\nfifty years and more, and that when he was a boy at the Free School at\r\nGuildford he and his fellows \"did runne and plaie there at crickett and\r\nother plaies.\" The evidence is interesting, because he is not asked for\r\nan explanation. Everybody at that date evidently knew at once what\r\ncricket meant. Besides being a cricket ground, the land was used for\r\nbaiting bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSHALFORD AND WONERSH\r\n\r\n    Shalford and its Stocks.--The Common.--Vanity Fair.--The Court of\r\n    Dusty-Feet.--Unstead in floodwater.--Dog Smith.--Bramley\r\n    Mill.--Wonersh, Ignorsh, Ognersh.--A village well cared for.--A\r\n    Grisly Barometer.--Tangley Manor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight highroads converge on Guildford, and these are fed, of course, by\r\nmany minor roads. Besides the roads, five lines of railways run into and\r\nleave the town, so that it is eminently possible, from Guildford, to do\r\neither of two things, to take a walk in a ring and return to the town by\r\nanother road, or, what is perhaps a little more luxurious, but enables\r\nyou to cover more country, you can walk in almost any direction, and at\r\nthe end of the day take a train back to the town. The highroad runs\r\nnorth to Woking and Horsell; north-east the Ripley road goes by Cobham\r\nto Kingston and London; eastwards, under Merrow Downs, you can walk by\r\nClandon and the Horsleys to Leatherhead; a smaller road travels\r\nsouth-west by St. Martha's Chapel to Chilworth; almost due south a road\r\nruns through Shalford to Wonersh, or breaks off at Shalford to go east\r\nto Dorking; another southern road is to Godalming; the great west road\r\npasses over the Hog's Back to Farnham, and north-west lie Worplesdon\r\nand Bisley. And the railways can be joined north, east, south, and west.\r\n\r\nGodalming, four miles away, is a centre in itself, and has its own\r\nchapter. But Guildford is the best centre from which to see some of\r\nGodalming's neighbours. A good ring is by Shalford through Bramley and\r\nWonersh, returning by Chilworth under St. Martha's. Shalford lies a mile\r\nto the south, and with its old mill, its inn, its white and green\r\ncottages, and its stocks, is a charming survival perilously near the\r\nGuildford builder. The stocks stand by the churchyard gates, side by\r\nside with a curious little shrubbery. Shrubberies are rare ornaments of\r\na village, but this sets a pretty foreground to the low line of whitened\r\ncottages behind it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shalford._]\r\n\r\nShalford Common is wide and breezy; geese cackle over its grass, and you\r\nmay see more than one cricket match being played on holiday afternoons.\r\nOnce, in 1877, eleven Mitchells played eleven Heaths on the common; the\r\nHeaths were all of the same family, but the Mitchells, though related,\r\nwere not. But the greatest tradition of Shalford Common is its\r\nconnection with a Bedfordshire man, John Bunyan. Bunyan is said to have\r\nlived in two houses in Surrey, a cottage on Quarry Hill in Guildford,\r\nand at Horn Hatch, now pulled down, on Shalford Common. Probably the\r\ntradition would not have grown up without good ground; there is one\r\npossible reason, at all events, for connecting Bunyan with this part of\r\nSurrey. The idea of _Pilgrim's Progress_ is said to have been suggested\r\nto him by the very Pilgrims' Way, and Vanity Fair to be the fair held on\r\nthe meadow between Shalford and Guildford below St. Catherine's Chapel.\r\nThe Rector of Shalford had the privilege of holding a fair from the days\r\nof King John, and undoubtedly Shalford Fair was one of the largest held\r\non the Way; indeed, it was so popular that the Guildford clergy disputed\r\nthe Rector's right to exact fees from the Winchester merchants attending\r\nit. They wanted the money in Guildford. But the Chief Justice of the\r\nKing's Bench gave his judgment in the Shalford Rector's favour, and at\r\nthe height of the fair's prosperity it actually covered a hundred and\r\nforty acres of ground. If tradition is right, then, it was in the fields\r\nby Shalford Church that Bunyan pictured Christian and Faithful seized\r\nand brought before the Court of the fair, and poor Faithful sentenced by\r\nLord Hategood \"to be led from the place where he was to the place from\r\nwhence he came, and there to be put to the most cruel death that could\r\nbe invented.\" No doubt Bunyan's description of the trial of the two\r\npilgrims at the fair is an exact picture of the methods of the Court of\r\nPie-powder, or _Pied-puldreaux_, the tribunal which could be summoned at\r\na moment's notice among the merchants of the fair. The Court of\r\nDusty-Feet certainly worked with alarming despatch.\r\n\r\nIf Bunyan really drew his _Pilgrim's Progress_ from his memories of the\r\npilgrims and their fairs on the Way, he may have had other scenes in his\r\nmind which suggested other names. The Delectable Mountains may have been\r\nthe blue line of the Sussex Downs, or the hills by Black Down and\r\nHindhead. The Slough of Despond may have been the marshy pools of\r\nShalford Common, or the ponds under the hill by Chilworth; and Doubting\r\nCastle, spelt Dowding Castle, is actually a name to be found on the\r\nSurrey map, south of Epsom Downs on Banstead Heath. But whether Bunyan\r\never saw it there is another matter.\r\n\r\nFrom Shalford Common the road runs almost straight to Bramley. But it is\r\nworth while to leave the main road as it crosses the single railway line\r\nfrom Shalford to Bramley and Cranleigh, and to turn to the right down\r\nthe little road that leads to Unstead Farm, a delightful brick and\r\ntimber building, with exceptionally graceful chimney-stacks and latticed\r\ncasements, behind which, in summer, there should surely be the largest\r\nbowls of roses. I saw the old house last in a frosty December sunset,\r\nsurrounded by floodwater, with farm horses splashing up the road, and\r\nplovers crying round the edges of the stream. It looked desolate enough;\r\nbut three hundred years ago it was a fine house, at one time the\r\nproperty of the Austens of Shalford, and later passing into the hands of\r\nthe trustees of Henry Smith, the \"Dog Smith\" who gave so much to Surrey\r\ncharities, and about whom Aubrey heard a quaint legend. \"He had the\r\nnickname of Dog-Smyth, because he kept no house, but dined at friends'\r\nhouses, and then desired a bit for his dog, which was to refect\r\nhimself.\" Was he merely a crochety old gentleman who always went about\r\nwith his dog, or did he keep the dog's dinner for himself? Another story\r\nabout him was that once, when he was a poor boy, he was whipped through\r\none of the Surrey parishes--accounts differ as to whether it was\r\nChilworth, Tatsfield, or Wanborough--and that he struck that particular\r\nparish out of his will, but left large sums to all the others. He\r\ncertainly left a large fortune to Surrey parishes, and no bequests have\r\nfound their way to Chilworth, Tatsfield, or Wanborough, but that is the\r\nonly foundation for the old story.\r\n\r\nA mile south-west of Unstead Farm lies Bramley, which has grown up round\r\nthe station of the single railway line running to Guildford. The\r\nrestored church holds some good glass, but the prettiest thing in\r\nBramley is an old mill which, with its medlar tree overhanging the\r\nwater, its ducks and pigeons, its octagonal brick dovecot and lichened\r\nroofs, and its sweet-water grape vine clambering on the old walls, has\r\na rich grace of colour and age setting it, in modern Bramley, a thing\r\napart.\r\n\r\nBramley is almost joined by Wonersh to the east: Wonersh with its quaint\r\nother names, Wogheners, which was perhaps the original form, Wonish,\r\nIgnorsh, and Ognersh. Wonersh was once a very important village. It was\r\none of the centres of the wool trade in the county, and of Wonersh, as\r\nof Guildford, Aubrey has the same sad story to tell of cheating\r\nclothiers. But, as we have seen, the real cause of the decay of the\r\nSurrey wool industry was something quite different. Perhaps one of\r\nWonersh's rival clothiers started the story of the stretched cloth;\r\nperhaps it was never a libel.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the village is an enormous wall, built by one of\r\nthe Lords Grantley who had Wonersh Park, and put up the wall,\r\napparently, to prevent neighbours and passers-by from gazing with too\r\ngreat enthusiasm at his lordship's grass and trees. It was a brother of\r\nthe third Lord Grantley, George Norton, Recorder of Guildford, who\r\nmarried the famous Mrs. Norton, one of the three beautiful\r\ngranddaughters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.\r\n\r\nBesides Lord Grantley's wall, the village holds some charming old\r\ncottages, several of them carefully restored, and two or three\r\nsquare-set, solid eighteenth-century houses. There is also a slender\r\nbrick chimney of elaborate design of which Wonersh residents are justly\r\nproud. The village, indeed, conveys the impression of being\r\naffectionately cared for, which is not always the case with villages\r\nwhich belong so much to builders long dead; but nothing, perhaps, is a\r\nbetter example of the care with which the past is preserved than the\r\nchurch, which is a perfect piece of restoration and scholarly rebuilding\r\ncombined. It is the work of a Surrey architect, Sir Charles Nicholson, a\r\nneighbour at Chilworth, who carried out his difficult task in 1901, and\r\nhas since written an interesting little pamphlet on the church's\r\nhistory. Two or three peculiarities distinguish the interior. One is a\r\ncrypt, paved with fourteenth-century encaustic tiles, which Aubrey\r\ndescribes as \"a vault strongly barricaded with iron.\" Another is a\r\nmagnificent Flemish chandelier, not a common adornment of a chancel. A\r\nthird is a high tomb of Sussex marble, which bears no inscription. But\r\nthe person buried in it must have been of considerable distinction, for\r\nthe cassia in which the remains Were embalmed still sweats from the\r\nmarble in wet weather--a grisly barometer. Possibly within may rest the\r\nremains of one of the Westons or Carylls, both of which were great\r\nfamilies of the neighbourhood. It was John Caryll, buried in this\r\nchurch, on whom was written an epitaph quoted by Aubrey, but not now to\r\nbe found. The eight lines of rhyme ended with what was perhaps thought\r\nappropriately cheerful resignation:--\r\n\r\n    \"And now, which long before he did desire,\r\n    Caryll sings Carrolls in the Heavenly Choire.\"\r\n\r\nNorth of Wonersh rises Chinthurst Hill, a knoll conspicuous for miles\r\nround, especially in winter, when the bleached grass of its wind-swept,\r\npine-crowned cap gleams strangely white in the sun. North of Chinthurst\r\nHill, again, on the far side of the open stretch of Shalford Common,\r\nstands one of the most perfect timbered houses--perhaps it is the most\r\nperfect--in the county. This is the famous Tangley Manor, which\r\naccording to the legend was one of King John's hunting boxes, and is now\r\nas delightfully picturesque a country house as is to be seen in the\r\nsouth of England. Like other old mansions in the county, Crowhurst\r\nPlace, for instance, the building of it belongs to two periods. It is a\r\nhouse, or rather a hall, within a house. The hall is the older part. It\r\nwas a feature of English country life previous to the sixteenth century\r\nthat the labourers and dependants of the great country estates ate, and\r\nin the earliest days even slept, in the hall of the mansion. When that\r\nsystem of common hall life ended, it nearly always happened that the\r\ngreat hall was cut in two, by a floor and bedrooms built in the upper\r\npart. This is what has happened at Tangley and at Crowhurst Place, and\r\nin each case the remains of the hall can be traced in the superb oak\r\ntie-beams which cross the bedrooms from side to side of the house. The\r\nhall is cased by a more modern building, a rich timber framework with\r\nthe date 1582 carved sprawling on the wood. The garden has every charm\r\nthat can belong to lichened brick walls, loop-holed and many-gated, and\r\nthrough the garden round the house runs a moat, in which trout swim, or\r\nonce swam. John Evelyn of Wotton knew the Tangley manor moat and garden;\r\npossibly some of the daffodils which brighten the grass in April are\r\ndescendants of bulbs he planted. On a pane of glass in one of the\r\nbedrooms he has scratched his name and the date \"John Euelyn, 1641.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond Tangley Manor to the north the railway runs a loose parallel to\r\nthe little Tillingbourne, through Chilworth, Albury, Shere and Gomshall.\r\nBut the villages of the Tillingbourne belong to another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGES OF THE TILLINGBOURNE\r\n\r\n    Chilworth.--Gunpowder and Banknotes.--Cashier for fifty years.--The\r\n    Evelyns' Powdermills.--Albury's chimneys.--A Yew hedge quarter of a\r\n    mile long.--Sherborne ponds: the Silent Pool.--King John and Sabrina\r\n    drowned.--Trout fed on Sandwiches.--Shere.--The prettiest village of\r\n    all.--The Tillingbourne.--William Bray, aged 97.--A Yeoman's\r\n    Will.--Shere Registers.--From Ann to Carbetia.--Gomshall.--Starving\r\n    a Retainer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour villages and a group of powdermills stand on the banks of the\r\nTillingbourne, which runs its short race of clear spring water from the\r\nnorthern slopes of Leith Hill to the Wey by Shalford. There are scarcely\r\na dozen miles of the Tillingbourne altogether, but it runs through the\r\nprettiest string of villages in the county. Friday Street is at its\r\nsource; Abinger Hammer, with two large millponds, is next; Gomshall lies\r\na mile to the west of Abinger Hammer, Shere a mile to the west again,\r\nand Albury beyond Shere. Chilworth stands last on the bright little\r\nstream, hardly a village; not much more than a station, some\r\npowdermills, and reedy ponds.\r\n\r\nThe quickest road from Guildford to Chilworth is the railway. The best\r\nroad is over the downs. The road which Cobbett took when he came from\r\nKensington was over Merrow Downs to Newlands Corner, and it is worth\r\nwhile to climb up Newlands Corner to look at the view as Cobbett saw it,\r\nwith the pale distances of eight counties on his horizon, and the dark,\r\ntall chimneys of the powdermills he detested smoking below him. \"Here we\r\nlooked back over Middlesex,\" he writes, \"and into Buckinghamshire and\r\nBerkshire, away towards the north-west, into Essex and Kent towards the\r\neast, over part of Sussex to the south, and over part of Hampshire to\r\nthe west south-west.\" He might have added Oxfordshire. Nothing in Surrey\r\ndelighted Cobbett more than \"the narrow and exquisitely beautiful vale\r\nof Chilworth,\" at which he used to gaze from these downs. Only Hawkley\r\nHanger, just over the Hampshire border, filled him with greater\r\npleasure. But the Chilworth powdermills goaded him to fury:--\r\n\r\n\"This valley,\" he writes, white hot, \"which seems to have been created\r\nby a bountiful providence, as one of the choicest retreats of man; which\r\nseems formed for a scene of innocence and happiness, has been, by\r\nungrateful man, so perverted as to make it instrumental in effecting two\r\nof the most damnable of purposes; in carrying into execution two of the\r\nmost damnable inventions that ever sprang from the minds of man under\r\nthe influence of the devil! namely, the making of _gunpowder_ and of\r\n_bank-notes_! Here in this tranquil spot, where the nightingales are to\r\nbe heard earlier and later in the year than in any other part of\r\nEngland; where the first bursting of the bud is seen in spring, where no\r\nrigour of seasons can ever be felt; where everything seems formed for\r\nprecluding the very thought of wickedness; here has the devil fixed on\r\nas one of the seats of his grand manufactory; and perverse and\r\nungrateful man not only lends him aid, but lends it cheerfully! As to\r\nthe gunpowder, indeed, we might get over that. In some cases that may be\r\ninnocently and, when it sends the lead at the hordes that support a\r\ntyrant, meritoriously employed. The alders and the willows, therefore,\r\none can see, without so much regret, turned into powder by the waters of\r\nthis valley; but, the _Bank-notes_! To think that the springs which God\r\nhas commanded to flow from the sides of these happy hills for the\r\ncomfort and the delight of man; to think that these springs should be\r\nperverted into means of spreading misery over a whole nation and that,\r\ntoo, under the base and hypocritical pretence of promoting its _credit_\r\nand maintaining its _honour_ and its _faith_! There was one\r\ncircumstance, indeed, that served to mitigate the melancholy excited by\r\nthese reflections; namely, that a part of these springs have, at times,\r\nassisted in turning rags into Registers! Somewhat cheered by the thought\r\nof this, but, still, in a more melancholy mood than I had been for a\r\nlong while, I rode on with my friend towards Albury up the valley.\"\r\n\r\nThe papermills which called down Cobbett's curses were probably\r\noriginally powdermills, and were turned to their new uses first in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne. The Bank at first issued no notes of smaller value\r\nthan L20; ten-pound notes were first issued in 1759, and five pound\r\nnotes in 1793, and one and two pound notes four years later. Local\r\ntradition, for an explanation of the name Newlands Corner, has decided\r\nthat it must have been called after Abraham Newland, who was chief\r\ncashier of the Bank of England for fifty years till 1807, and whose\r\nname, therefore, would be as familiar to King George's subjects, as is\r\nMay or Owen to a later day. But local tradition is mistaken. The name\r\noccurs on Bowen's map of the county, dedicated to Richard, third Baron\r\nOnslow, in 1749, when Newland was an unknown boy of nineteen.\r\n\r\nA much greater Surrey industry than paper-making is the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder. Indeed, whenever England was at war, from the days of\r\nElizabeth to those of the Parliament, the control of the Surrey powder\r\nworks was a vital point in the struggle. The first gunpowder manufactory\r\nseems to have been established at Rotherhithe, where Henry Reve had a\r\nmill in 1554. We were then getting a considerable quantity of our\r\ngunpowder from abroad, and that was a state of affairs which continued\r\ntill the coming of the Armada. When the Armada came, England was\r\ndangerously unprepared for war. It was lucky that Howard's and Drake's\r\nfireships ended the fleet so quickly, for anything like a prolonged sea\r\ncampaign would have been out of the question. We had not enough powder.\r\nAccounts made up in the year 1600 show that up to the day when the\r\nArmada sail was sighted, there was never more than twenty or thirty\r\nlasts (a last was about a ton) of English powder delivered yearly into\r\nthe Queen's stores. After the Armada, the Queen's Ministers set to work\r\nto put the gunpowder supply on a proper basis, and it was then that\r\nSurrey and a great Surrey family became inseparably associated with the\r\nmaking of explosives.\r\n\r\nGeorge Evelyn (grandfather of a more famous grandson, John Evelyn of\r\nWotton) and John, his son, were first licensed in 1589 to dig saltpetre\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland, and set up their first powdermills on the\r\nlittle Hogsmill River, which joins the Thames at Kingston. Later, George\r\nEvelyn retired, and John, having transferred his mills to Godstone, took\r\nhis brother Robert and three others into partnership and started on a\r\ncontract by which they supplied the Queen with a hundred lasts of powder\r\nyearly at 7d. the pound. In 1604 the firm was practically reduced to\r\nJohn and Robert Evelyn, and a partner named Hardinge, the others being\r\ndead or doing no work. The firm was now employing a thousand hands, and\r\nwas given twenty-one years' contract to supply 120 lasts yearly at 8d.\r\nper pound--nearly L10,000 worth of powder. But James I soon broke this\r\ncontract, and after three years the contract was given to the Earl of\r\nWorcester; though whether the Earl ever made any powder, or what he did\r\nwith his contract, nobody knows. The progress of the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder now becomes very obscure, though probably John Evelyn kept his\r\nmills running at Godstone, making reduced quantities. It is not till\r\n1621 that we find John Evelyn making another large contract with the\r\nGovernment, but after that date the contracts were renewed every two or\r\nthree years, until the Evelyns in 1636 ceased to supply the Government\r\naltogether. Their difficulties must have been almost intolerable. John\r\nEvelyn and his son, also named John, who succeeded him in 1627, appear\r\nto have been always punctual and trustworthy in supplying the powder\r\nrequired, but the King would not or could not pay for it. The history of\r\neach contract is always the same; for a few months all goes swimmingly,\r\nthen comes the Crown's inability to pay up; next stoppage of supplies;\r\neventually, settling up and a new contract. The Evelyn mills made the\r\nlast pound of powder for the King in 1636, and then under protest.\r\nCharles was used to protests.\r\n\r\nSo far very little powder had been made at Chilworth. The Evelyn mills\r\nwere at Godstone--possibly near Wotton also. But it was the Chilworth\r\npowdermills which broke the Evelyns' business. Immediately on coming to\r\nthe throne Charles I gave leave to the East India Company to set up\r\npowdermills on the skirts of Windsor Park; but the mills frightened the\r\ndeer and were moved to Chilworth. Here, apparently, Sir Edward Randyll\r\nowned or built a large number of mills, which he leased to the Company,\r\nand it was the competition of the Company which silenced Evelyn's mills.\r\nBut the Company was equally unsuccessful in keeping the business.\r\nCharles I was struck with the idea of turning shopkeeper himself, and\r\ngave the sole Government contract to one Cordwell, from whom he bought\r\npowder at 7-1/2d. the pound and sold it to the lieges at eighteenpence.\r\nThat did not last long. The Long Parliament assembled in 1641, and the\r\nmonopoly was abolished. From that date anybody might make gunpowder, and\r\nSurrey ceased to be the single centre of the industry. But the Chilworth\r\nmills still did a great deal of business--sometimes bad business. Sir\r\nPolycarpus Wharton, who had a twenty-one years' lease under Charles II,\r\nJames II and William III, is said to have lost L24,000 over the mills,\r\nsimply because he could not get paid by the Government, and actually\r\nwent to a debtor's prison. Fifty years ago the industry had declined\r\nalmost to a vanishing point. It revived in 1880, when experiments were\r\nmade in new powders for heavy guns, and to-day the Chilworth Mills make\r\ncordite, without the miserable consequences which befel Sir Polycarpus\r\nWharton.\r\n\r\nIt seemed worth while, at the risk of spattering the page with dates and\r\nfacts of gunpowder dryness, to attempt this short sketch of the Surrey\r\ngunpowder industry, if only to escape from the confusion of current\r\nlegends. Chief among the traditions of the Chilworth mills is that which\r\nmakes them the property of John Evelyn of Wotton. No Evelyn owned a\r\npowdermill at Chilworth, and John Evelyn of Wotton, though he may have\r\nowned a casual mill or so elsewhere, is not the John Evelyn who owned\r\nand worked the Godstone mills. Those mills belonged to the diarist's\r\ngrandfather, George Evelyn, and to George Evelyn's son and grandson,\r\nboth named John. The latter was the diarist's cousin. I ought to add\r\nthat I am indebted, for most of this history of gunpowder, to the\r\nadmirable article on the subject by Mr. Montague Giuseppi, published in\r\nthe Victoria History of the County.\r\n\r\nAlbury is nearly two miles from Chilworth station, and the Tillingbourne\r\nruns through and under it. Albury has a number of beautiful chimneys;\r\nchimneys that are tall and graceful, of red brick, shaped and moulded in\r\ningenious spirals, with patterned sides and columns, and crowsteps and\r\nother ornaments and uses. You would not guess all that a chimney can be,\r\nuntil you have seen Albury. A year or two ago there was another charm in\r\nthe village. You looked in from the main street at what seemed like half\r\na road, half an entrance to a square of houses, and found yourself in\r\nthe remains of an old farmyard, of which one side was a row of cottages.\r\nThe rest was old red brick--I think I remember a great dovecote--and a\r\nquiet look of age and disuse. But now new buildings are rising in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chimneys, Albury._]\r\n\r\nJust outside Albury is one of the Duke of Northumberland's houses, in\r\nAlbury Park. The garden holds a historic yew hedge, but it is not shown\r\nto the public and I have not seen it. John Evelyn laid out the gardens;\r\nCobbett has described the yew hedge. In his day it belonged to Mr.\r\nDrummond, a banker, and Cobbett, who had heard much of the park and\r\ngardens, rode up to the house and asked permission to see them. So he\r\nsaw the yew hedge, and wrote about it.\r\n\r\n\"Between the house and the gardens there is a very beautiful run of\r\nwater, with a sort of little, wild, narrow sedgy meadow. The gardens are\r\nseparated from this by a hedge, running along from east to west. From\r\nthis hedge there go up the hill, at right angles, several other hedges,\r\nwhich divide the land here into distinct gardens, or orchards. Along at\r\nthe top of these there goes a yew hedge, or, rather, a row of small yew\r\ntrees, the trunks of which are bare for about eight or ten feet high,\r\nand the tops of which form one solid head of about ten feet high, while\r\nthe bottom branches come out on each side of the row about eight feet\r\nhorizontally. This hedge, or row, is a _quarter of a mile long_. There\r\nis a nice hard sand road under this species of umbrella; and summer and\r\nwinter, here is a most delightful walk! Between this row of yews, there\r\nis a space, or garden (a quarter of a mile long you will observe) about\r\nthirty or forty feet wide, as nearly as I can recollect. At the back of\r\nthis garden, and facing the yew tree row, is a wall probably ten feet\r\nhigh, which forms the breastwork of a terrace; and it is this terrace\r\nwhich is the most beautiful thing that I ever saw in the gardening way.\r\nIt is a quarter of a mile long, and, I believe, between thirty and forty\r\nfeet wide; of the finest green sward and as level as a die.\"\r\n\r\nIn Albury Park is a ruined church. Its history is not very edifying. Mr.\r\nDrummond, the banker, who built the Catholic Apostolic cathedral near\r\nby, obtained permission to shut up the old church if he built a new one\r\nelsewhere. He built the new church, and the old, with its graves and\r\nmemories, was abandoned. The footpath leading to it remains open to the\r\npublic, and runs under the shade of some superb Spanish chestnuts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps half a mile from the park, in the depth of a wood of box, are\r\nthe two Sherborne Farm ponds, one of which has come by the name of the\r\nSilent Pool. The Sherborne ponds lie somewhere near the track of the\r\npilgrims, and I like to think that the journeying men knew them and\r\ndrank their clear water. Legend has grown round the deeper, upper pool.\r\nMartin Tupper, in his strange medley _Stephan Langton_, has shaped it\r\ninto his story. A lovely peasant girl used to bathe in the pool; King\r\nJohn, riding by, saw her and drove his horse at her, and she, trying to\r\nescape, fell into deep water and was drowned. That was not enough for\r\nMartin Tupper; he decided that her brother should try to rescue her and\r\nbe drowned also. There they lay, the two of them; \"the brother and\r\nsister are locked in each other's arms in the tranquil crystal depth of\r\nShirebourne Pond; and the rippled surface is all smooth once more; and\r\nyou may see the trout shoaling among the still green weeds around that\r\nnaked raven-haired Sabrina, and her poor drowned brother in his cowskin\r\ntunic.\" So wrote Tupper; a most moving finish of a chapter.\r\n\r\nTo gain the Silent Pool, if you are in Albury, walk eastwards right\r\nthrough the village and turn to the left over the Tillingbourne. Then to\r\nthe left again, and you will spy a cottage, the gate of which bears the\r\nlegend \"Key of the Pool kept here.\" How should a pool have a key? It\r\nturns out to be two keys, one of a padlock shutting an iron gate leading\r\nto a grove of box trees; you shut the padlock and find that you have\r\nleft all who come after you--and on Saturdays at least they are many--to\r\nclimb the fence. The Silent Pool, when I saw it first, a little\r\ndisappointed me. I ought to have known that it would, because everybody\r\ncould tell me where it was, even quite unintelligent people walking\r\nabout the road two miles away. I think I hoped the pool would be, not\r\nonly solitary and sequestered, but entirely deserted by human beings; a\r\npool on which you came suddenly, lying hidden in the heart of chalky\r\ndells dark green with box trees; it was to be as deep as a well, and\r\ncold with the coldness of a spring; smelling, too, of bitter wet box and\r\nsun-warmed chalk. It was to be a pool at the side of which the stranger\r\nshould seat himself, and discover the air of the place so quiet and\r\nenchanted that he could hear no sound of birds or beasts or men; only,\r\nperhaps, the melodious drip of the rain-heavy boughs into the clear\r\npeacock-green depths of water. And, in fact, the disappointment is that\r\nthis is precisely what the Silent Pool might be. It is what it used to\r\nbe, I think; but so many people have heard of it and have come on\r\nbicycles and in carriages and motor-cars to see it, that the leaf-strewn\r\npaths are trampled into mud round it; and it cannot be called silent,\r\nfor you will not escape hearing other people, who have quite as much\r\nright as you to be there, talk about it and tramp round its margin.\r\nThen, too, for the convenience of visitors, there has been built on the\r\nedge of the pool a thatched arbour of wood, into which you admit\r\nyourself with a very large key, only to be deafened on the spot by ten\r\nthousand cockney names scrawled on the white walls round you. Those who\r\nhave gibbeted themselves on the walls have also thrown the newspapers\r\nthat held their lunch into the water, and bottles with the paper--a most\r\nunhappy spectacle. Had I the right to touch the place, the arbour would\r\nbe packed up offhand for Rosherville. Only in one particular has the\r\narbour any claim on the wayfarer's gratitude. It enables him to watch\r\nthe large trout which swim in the clear deep water under him as closely\r\nas if they were behind the glass of an aquarium. Trout which leap out of\r\nthe water every two minutes in a spring afternoon, and yet which are\r\ntame enough to come and be fed under the rail of a wooden arbour by\r\ntrooping visitors, are a sight for idle fishermen to see. I have fed\r\nthem with worms, but I suspect them to be better used to sandwiches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fireplace in White Horse, Shere._]\r\n\r\nThe road runs eastward a mile from Sherborne ponds to Shere. Who first\r\nnamed the Shirebourne pond the Silent Pool? The old name is the best,\r\nand the water of the pond ought to be added to the beauties of Shere. If\r\nShere is to be counted the prettiest Surrey village of all, I think it\r\nis the Tillingbourne which decides the choice. Six or seven other\r\nvillages occur, each with its own fascination; Alfold, deep among the\r\nprimroses of the Fold Country; Chiddingfold, with its old inn and the\r\nred cottages set round the green; Compton, with its flower gardens and\r\nold timber; Thorpe, quiet among the elms; Oxted, lining the hill road\r\nunder the downs, and the Bell inn at the cross-ways; Betchworth and its\r\ncottage roses; Coldharbour dotted over the sandstone; Friday Street,\r\nhardly a village, on the banks of the tarn among the pines; but each\r\nfails compared with Shere. Friday Street shows the reason plain. Without\r\nthe water Friday Street would pass unnoticed; it is the water which\r\ndecides for Shere. The village groups itself with the little brook\r\nrunning through the middle: a low bridge crosses the stream, villagers\r\nsit on the bridge, white ducks paddle about the current and stand upside\r\ndown among the weeds: beyond the brook are the tiny village green and\r\nthe shade of elms; on one side of the village green is the old inn, the\r\nWhite Horse; and on the other the grey tower and the quiet of the\r\nchurchyard. But it is the sparkle and the chatter of the Tillingbourne\r\nwhich are the first charm of all.\r\n\r\nThe White Horse is a pattern of an old village inn, with panelled rooms\r\nand dark beams over its ceilings, and a parlour hung with oil paintings,\r\nwith the air of the Surrey countryside blowing through them. Your host\r\nis the artist, and fellow artists come to the White Horse to sketch with\r\nhim. It is the only inn in Surrey I know which also sells a guide to the\r\nneighbourhood, and a good guide too, so far as directions for finding\r\nwalks among the hills and woods can make a guide-book. Mr. Marriott\r\nWatson has written an introduction to it, of which the sum is that all\r\nwalks start from the White Horse, and all walkers come back to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shere Church._]\r\n\r\nShere church is a medley of alterations; perhaps its most interesting\r\nconnection is its link with the old Surrey family of Bray. The Brays\r\nhave lived at Shere for more than four hundred years. The first Sir\r\nRobert Bray was a knight of Richard I, and one of his descendants, Sir\r\nReginald, was granted the manor of Shere, in 1497. Sir Reginald was one\r\nof the most distinguished of all the long line; he was a Knight of the\r\nGarter, and the Bray Chapel in St. George's, Windsor, is his work; his\r\nemblem the bray, or seed-crusher, is on the ceiling. But the member of\r\nthe family who had most to do with the country was William Bray, the\r\nsecond of the two classical writers of the county history. William Bray\r\nwas born in 1736, and was a scholar whose learning was only equalled by\r\nhis astonishing vitality. He began his main work at an age when most\r\nmen's work is done. When the Rev. Owen Manning, after years of labour\r\nat the history of Surrey, went blind and had to give up the hope of a\r\nlifetime, William Bray finished the book. He was untiring. The first\r\nvolume appeared in 1804, when he was sixty-eight, and when the second\r\nvolume was published, five years latter, he wrote in his preface \"that\r\nthere was not a parish described in it which he had not visited, and\r\nonly two churches the insides of which he had not seen, and the\r\nmonuments in which he had not personally examined, once at least, but to\r\nmany he made repeated visits.\" The third volume came out in 1814, and\r\nthen, at the age of seventy-eight, he edited John Evelyn's _Memoirs_\r\nfrom the original MSS. at Wotton. He was to live nearly twenty years\r\nafter that, and he died at Shere at the age of ninety-seven; a tablet\r\nstands to his memory in the chancel of the church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shere._]\r\n\r\nMr. Granville Leveson-Gower, in a paper on \"Shere and its Rectors\" in\r\nthe _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, gives the items of a will he\r\ndiscovered by accident, interesting as showing the amount of stock kept\r\nupon his farm by a yeoman of the sixteenth century. The will is dated\r\n27th October, 1562, and the testator is John Risbridger--one of the good\r\nold Surrey yeoman names, like Evershed and Whapshot and Enticknap. He\r\ndescribes himself as \"John Risbridger of Shere, yeoman, sicke of bodie\r\nand yet walkinge. His body to be buried in Parish Church of Shere,\r\n'without my seats ende.' 1 calf and 2 shepe, with sufficient breade and\r\ndrinke thereunto to be bestowed and spent at his burial towards the\r\nreliefe of the poore there assembled. To every man and maid servant, 1\r\newe shepe; to Alice Stydman his maid, one herfore (i.e. heifer)\r\nbullocke, of two years and 15s: to his son William all his lease or\r\nterme of years in lands called Stonehill, and to him 4 oxen, 2 steares\r\nof 3 yeres, 2 horse beastes, a weane (wagon) yoke, cheynes to draw\r\nwithal, 2 keyne, half a hundreth of shepe. Children, John, William, and\r\nEdward. To daughter Dorothie, L6. 13s. 4d.; all residue to wife\r\nKatherine. Proved 3rd May, 1654, by William Risbridger.\"\r\n\r\nSome extracts made by Mr. Leveson-Gower from the Parish Registers have\r\nan interest which is not peculiar to Shere, but the Registers are a good\r\nexample of village history written in the names of its inhabitants. You\r\nbegin with the simplicity, almost the affection, of the early entries,\r\nthe Johns and Anns and Marys repeated year after year, and the few words\r\ndescribing the older people; then comes the Georgian day when Fielding\r\nand Richardson were on the bookshelves, and children were named after\r\nthe heroines of the novels. Here are a dozen entries out of hundreds:--\r\n\r\n    Elizabeth Gatton (widow), neer 100 yeeres old, was Buryed 13 of July,\r\n      1691.\r\n    Widow Rowland (old and poor). May 18, 1701.\r\n    Elizabeth Nye, an ancient widow. Buried 23 Mar., 1715.\r\n    1732. Old Edward Stone, yeoman. Dec. y^e 30^th.\r\n    1739. William Wood, a poor unfortunate lad, being drown'd, was buried\r\n      Ap. 27.\r\n    Mary, daughter of Thomas Evershed, bap. Ap. 30, 1729.\r\n    Ann, daughter of Thomas Evershed, bap. Aug. 17, 1733.\r\n    Mary, daughter of Thomas Evershed, bap. May 14, 1736.\r\n    Ann, daughter of Mr. Robert Parkhurst, bap. Feb. 23, 1741-2.\r\n    1779. Gosling, Tho., son of Thomas and Dinah. May 25. (Note)\r\n      --married, child christened, wife churched the same day, by me,\r\n      Tho^s Duncumb, Rector.\r\n    1817. Carbetia Hall, of Shere, gentlewoman. Sep. 2, 68.\r\n    1821. Servilla Briscoe, of Abinger. April 17, 23.\r\n\r\nOne of the later entries in the Registers is interesting to historians.\r\nHarriet Grote, widow of George Grote, died at Shere in 1878, aged 86.\r\nHer grave is south of the church: Grote lies in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nShere and Gomshall are only divided by an avenue of elms--half a mile of\r\nthe pleasantest and shadiest of roads. Gomshall is a village scattered\r\nround many lanes; it has a Black Horse inn near the station, but the\r\nprettiest Gomshall cottages are away from the Black Horse, down the\r\nlanes off the main road. Gomshall Manor, now a boarding-house, has\r\ntraditions of the Middle Ages. There is a story of a door leading to a\r\nsecret chamber which ought to be somewhere in Martin Tupper's books, but\r\nI cannot find it. King John was annoyed with a retainer, shut him in\r\nthis room and turned the key in the door, and there the miserable\r\nretainer starved to death. It was just like King John to do it, but what\r\nhe did at Gomshall only tradition knows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gomshall._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nGUILDFORD TO LEATHERHEAD\r\n\r\n    Merrow.--The Horse and Groom.--Mr. Kipling on Surrey downs.--Clandon\r\n    Park.--The village mole-catcher.--A fearful battle.--February\r\n    sunshine.--Wide Ploughs.--Thomas Goffe and Thomas Thimble.--Locked\r\n    churches.--An atmosphere of war.--Effingham and its\r\n    admirals.--Little Bookham.--General d'Arblay in his\r\n    garden.--Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the two roads which run parallel to the downs east of Guildford,\r\ndoubtless the road south of the ridge runs through the prettiest\r\nvillages. Albury, Shere and Gomshall are a more charming trio than any\r\nthree that lie on the northern road, if only because of the woods about\r\nthem and the clear trout stream that runs under their walls and bridges.\r\nThe villages north of the ridge hardly have a good-sized pond between\r\nthem. But the walk from Guildford to Leatherhead, which can be shortened\r\nat any railway station you please from Clandon to Bookham, is for all\r\nthat a walk through delightful country and villages of unchanging quiet.\r\n\r\nMerrow is the first of the little hamlets that dot the Leatherhead road,\r\nand though the Guildford villas are stretching out their gardens further\r\nand further to the polite east, Merrow is still a mere group of downside\r\ncottages. The church might have been better restored; but the chief\r\nfeature of the village is the old Horse and Groom Inn, with its gabled\r\nfront and its noble stack of chimneys, three sister shafts of peculiar\r\ngrace and mellow colour. The date, 1615, which records the age of the\r\ninn above one of its bay windows, reads a reproach to the aggressively\r\nmodern porch and doors; and the white rough-cast with which the walls\r\nare covered apparently conceals admirable timber and herringbone\r\nbrickwork. But the roof and the gables and windows still belong to an\r\ninn and not a public-house, and the Horse and Groom too, swings a good\r\nsign, vigorously drawn, of a prancing steed. Most of the signs of the\r\nmany White Horse and Black Horse inns are more like rocking-horses than\r\nracers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Merrow._]\r\n\r\nAbove Merrow stretches some of the most perfect downland in England. If\r\nthe Sussex downs by Rottingdean inspired Mr. Kipling to his finest\r\npoetry, the Surrey downs by Merrow taught him some of the most haunting\r\nlines of all. I quote from eleven stanzas that ought not to be\r\nseparated:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMERROW DOWN\r\n\r\n    There runs a road by Merrow Down--\r\n      A grassy track to-day it is\r\n    An hour out of Guildford town,\r\n      Above the river Wey it is.\r\n\r\n    Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,\r\n      The ancient Britons dressed and rode\r\n    To watch the dark Phoenicians bring\r\n      Their goods along the Western Road.\r\n\r\n    But long and long before that time\r\n      (When bison used to roam on it)\r\n    Did Taffy and her Daddy climb\r\n      That down, and had their home on it.\r\n\r\n    The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,\r\n      Was more than six times bigger then;\r\n    And all the Tribe of Tegumai\r\n      They cut a noble figure then!\r\n\r\n    Of all the Tribe of Tegumai\r\n      Who cut that figure, none remain--\r\n    On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry--\r\n      The silence and the sun remain.\r\n\r\n    But as the faithful years return\r\n      And hearts unwounded sing again,\r\n    Comes Taffy dancing through the fern\r\n      To lead the Surrey spring again.\r\n\r\n    In mocassins and deer-skin cloak\r\n      Unfearing, free and fair she flits,\r\n    And lights her little damp-wood smoke\r\n      To show her Daddy where she flits.\r\n\r\n    For far--oh, very far behind,\r\n      So far she cannot call to him,\r\n    Comes Tegumai alone to find\r\n      The daughter that was all to him.\r\n\r\nMerrow to the east edges on Clandon Park, the seat of one of the great\r\nSurrey families, the Onslows. It is a notable space, perhaps a mile\r\nsquare of grass dotted with superb groups of elms. \"Capability\" Brown\r\nlaid out the park, and he certainly saw what the capabilities of that\r\nsunny sward could be. The house, which stands on the south-east corner,\r\nis an imposing cube of red brick, patched here and there with ivy, and\r\nas square and formal as the ornamental water and the park below it is\r\nformal and serpentine. Leoni built it, and Rysbrach designed two of its\r\nchimney-pieces.\r\n\r\nIn the park you may chance to meet the mole-catcher of the place--an\r\nupholder of right traditions of an old English village. I met him\r\nsearching disconsolately for a couple of his traps, which he had set too\r\nnear the pathway and which had been carried off by thieving passers-by,\r\non whom may malisons light. \"I've got forty traps about here,\" he told\r\nme with some pride, adding with resignation to a persistent fate that\r\n\"they\" would not let him set a trap near the path. \"They\" always took it\r\nif he did.\r\n\r\nWest Clandon church stands in the corner of the park, and is chiefly\r\nremarkable for a very curious old sundial, belonging perhaps to the days\r\nof Henry II, and built upside down by \"restorers\" into a buttress of the\r\nsouth wall. Time has dealt hardly with the church, and time, perhaps,\r\nmay still restore its own dial. Under the dial, when I was last in the\r\ncarefully tended little churchyard, the level turf was studded with\r\nsnowdrops.\r\n\r\nIn a field close by the village once took place a remarkable battle. A\r\ncorrespondent of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ of 1796 gives the following\r\naccount of it, which he had verbatim from an old inhabitant. \"A serpent\r\nonce infested a back lane in the parish of West Clandon for a long time.\r\nThe inhabitants were much disturbed and afraid to pass that way. A\r\nsoldier who had been condemned for desertion promised, if his life was\r\nspared, he would destroy this serpent. Accordingly he took his dog with\r\nhim. A fierce battle ensued, the dog fastened him and the soldier killed\r\nit with his bayonet in a field belonging to the glebe called Deadacre.\"\r\nAccording to the magazine's correspondent, an \"ancient piece of carving\r\nin wood\" representing this frightful struggle, had been \"preserved for\r\nmany years in the parsonage house.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the two Clandons, West and East, the road runs by what is surely\r\nthe finest ploughland in the county. A single field of over a hundred\r\nacres stretches up the side of the down to a belt of firs--a field for\r\nCincinnatus himself to plough. I remember standing to stare at that\r\ngreat reach of shining stubble and furrow when first I saw it from the\r\nroad on a day of marvellous February sunlight. Farm labourers were\r\ntopping and tailing turnips two hundred yards away; partridges newly\r\npaired whirred up from the roadside; beyond the white stubbleland lay\r\nthe pines of Netley Heath, a thin line of palest blue; a hundred larks\r\nfilled the sky with singing, and I heard suddenly behind me the\r\nimpetuous thrill of a chaffinch, that most summery of carols. The\r\nploughland is Lord Onslow's, and it must need a Minister of Agriculture\r\nto look after it.\r\n\r\nEast Clandon lies under that broad ploughland, a mile from Clandon Park.\r\nEverything in East Clandon is what it ought to be, and everybody does\r\nwhat he ought to do. The timbered cottages are old and quiet; the barn\r\nroofs by the churchyard are long and lichened; the churchyard is\r\nbordered by a thick holly hedge, and about its graves, little clipped\r\nyew-trees stand like chessmen, perhaps meant to suggest a text; the\r\ncottage gardens are full of simple flowers and fruit-trees, and the\r\ncottagers work in them as if it were the best work to do, which\r\ndoubtless it is. There could not be a happier looking village. One\r\nbuilding only in the village knows, or shows, much suffering. At East\r\nClandon is the country branch of the Queen Alexandra Nursing Home for\r\nchildren with hip disease. In fine weather the children lie in their\r\ncots on the verandah, like broken toys, and wave happily from their red\r\nblankets to passers-by.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Charles I East Clandon boasted a poet. He was Thomas\r\nGoffe, a writer of tragedies, and most unhappily married. Aubrey tells\r\nthe story:--\r\n\r\n    \"His wife pretended to fall in love with him, by hearing of him\r\n    preach: upon which, said one Thomas Thimble (one of the Squire\r\n    Bedell's in Oxford, and his Confident) to him: '_Do not marry her:\r\n    if thou dost, she will break thy heart_.' He was not obsequious to\r\n    his friend's sober advice, but for her sake altered his condition,\r\n    and cast anchor here. One time some of his Oxford friends made a\r\n    visit to him she looked upon them with an ill eye, as if they had\r\n    come _to eat her out of house and home_ (as they say), she provided\r\n    a dish of milk, and some eggs for supper, and no more: They\r\n    perceived her niggardliness, and that her husband was inwardly\r\n    troubled at it (she wearing the breeches) so they were resolved to\r\n    be merry at supper, and talk all in Latin, and laughed exceedingly.\r\n    She was so vexed at their speaking Latin that she could not hold,\r\n    but fell out a weeping, and rose from the table. The next day, Mr.\r\n    Goffe ordered a better dinner for them, and sent for some wine: they\r\n    were merry, and his friends took their final leave of him. 'Twas no\r\n    long time before this Xanthippe made Mr. Thimble's prediction good;\r\n    and when he died, the last words he spake were: '_Oracle, Oracle,\r\n    Tom Thimble_,' and so he gave up the ghost.\"\r\n\r\nHalfway from East Clandon to West Horsley is Hatchlands, a fine country\r\nhouse and park with noble beeches; and next to Hatchlands one of the\r\nprettiest and completest farmsteads in the county. The building in the\r\nneighbourhood is, indeed, some of the best to be seen. West Horsley\r\nitself is a fascinating collection of old cottages, vine-bowered and\r\nfronted with clipped yews. One such yew, standing by the door of what\r\nthe picture postcards vaguely designate \"old cottage, West Horsley,\" is\r\nan extraordinarily elaborate piece of rustic topiary. Another feature of\r\nthe village is the now disused workhouse, a solid old brick building\r\noverlooking a horsepond: another, the bole of a superb elm, quite\r\nrightly stationed in the carpenter's sawyard. Of West Horsley church it\r\nis more difficult to speak. It is possible to see from outside that\r\nthere is a beautiful three lancet east window, but the rest of the\r\nchurch, with its chapel and fine monuments, is a sealed book. The door\r\nis locked, and the keys are kept at the rectory a mile away: the sexton,\r\nnext door to the church, is not allowed a key. It is not easy to write\r\nsoberly of an authority which compels for one who should be allowed to\r\nsee the church, four journeys of a mile to ask for and to return the\r\nkeys. From West Horsley to Leatherhead is a pilgrimage by locked\r\nchurches: East Horsley is locked, though you can get the key; Effingham\r\nand Little Bookham are locked, but I had no time to search for more keys\r\nwhen I was there; possibly they are easily found. Great Bookham is open,\r\nbut Fetcham is locked; Leatherhead is more hospitable.\r\n\r\nThe great families of West Horsley are those of Berners and Nicholas.\r\nThe effigy of Sir James Berners, of West Horsley Place, is in the\r\nchurch: he was one of the followers of Richard II, and was beheaded on\r\nTower Hill, in 1388. His daughter, according to tradition, was the\r\nfamous Dame Juliana Berners, Prioress of Sopwell, and author--or part\r\nauthor--of the _Boke of St. Albans_, a \"Treatyse perteynynge to\r\nHawkynge, Huntynge, Fysshynge, and Coote Armiris.\" Probably she wrote no\r\nmore than the hunting, but it is pleasant to think that she may have\r\nwatched her greyhounds \"headed like a snake, and necked like a drake\" on\r\nthe downs above Horsley. Another Berners, the second Baron of the name,\r\ntranslated Froissart. Of the Nicholas family, Sir Edward was a Royalist\r\nand Secretary of State under both the Charleses. Of other owners of West\r\nHorsley Place, its mistress, Geraldine Browne, wife of Sir Anthony\r\nBrowne, is claimed to be the \"Fair Geraldine\" of Surrey's poem; but any\r\nother Geraldine would suit as well, if, indeed, Geraldine ever existed.\r\nAnother doubtful tradition of West Horsley is that the head of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh is buried in the church with his son Carew. Certainly no\r\none knows that it was buried anywhere else.\r\n\r\nLeaving West Horsley, you are immediately in an atmosphere of war. At\r\nEast Horsley, the Duke of Wellington guards the cross-roads and\r\ndispenses excellent bread and cheese and beer; at Effingham Prince\r\nBluecher used to stand on the main road, quite correctly placed to the\r\neast of the Duke; he has now marched down into the village and billeted\r\nhimself as comfortably as before. The atmosphere of swords and sharpness\r\nhas even entered ecclesiastical precincts. In East Horsley church there\r\nis a curious fresco, painted, I am told, by the late Lady Lovelace. It\r\nshows St. Martin dressed as a soldier in high boots, cloak and hat,\r\ncutting off the skirt of his cloak with his sword, to clothe a naked\r\nbeggar kneeling before him. It is curious that a second legend of a\r\ncloak should belong to a neighbourhood connected with Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh.\r\n\r\nHorsley Towers, on the left of the road to Effingham, is a large, grey,\r\ncastellated building; its entrances might be fortifications. The park\r\nholds some superb beeches. But the grey coldness of Horsley Towers is a\r\nlittle exotic among these stretches of southern English parkland. Good\r\nJacobean or Georgian red-brick much better suits oaks and beeches than\r\nthe chateau-like towers of a Scottish castle.\r\n\r\nEffingham, although so small a village, has a name that will last with\r\nthe history of the English Navy. It gave his title to the first Lord\r\nHoward of Effingham, the illustrious father of a still more illustrious\r\nson. The first Lord of Effingham was William Howard, son of the second\r\nDuke of Norfolk, and one of the great men of the reigns of Mary and\r\nElizabeth. He was with Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold; he\r\nwas Lord High Admiral; at Sir Thomas Wyatt's rebellion he shut Ludgate\r\nin Wyatt's face, and more than any Englishman he helped Elizabeth to her\r\nthrone. But his son is an even greater figure. Like his father, he was\r\nLord High Admiral, but the father never had the son's opportunity. For\r\nthe second Lord Howard of Effingham commanded the English Navy against\r\nthe Spanish Armada, and as the victor of that tremendous fleet and the\r\ncaptor of Cadiz he was made Earl of Nottingham, and held the office of\r\nLord High Admiral until the green old age of eighty-three, when \"he\r\nretired,\" we are told, \"from public life, and the rest of his life was\r\npeace and prayer.\" He lies with his father at Reigate, which with the\r\nchurches of Lingfield and Great Bookham holds the dust of many\r\ngenerations of the Surrey Howards. Fourteen Howards have been buried at\r\nReigate, twelve at Lingfield, and thirty at Great Bookham; but so far as\r\nI can find, none, curiously enough, at Effingham itself.\r\n\r\nScarcely half a mile separates the churches of Effingham and Little\r\nBookham, the latter a tiny building considerably altered by various\r\nrestorations, but containing some interesting remains of Norman work.\r\nAlmost touching the church stands, and has stood since days before\r\nDomesday book was written, a great yew, dark and shining, with another\r\nthousand years' life in it, if its vigorous branches tell the truth. The\r\nvillage itself is not much more than a cottage or two, but Little\r\nBookham must always be a place of interest, at all events for those who\r\nread and write newspapers, for the Manor House is the home of one of the\r\ndoyens of English journalism, Mr. Meredith Townsend, for forty-four\r\nyears joint-editor of the _Spectator_.\r\n\r\n    \"Master and friend, whose ardent soul\r\n    Burns brighter as it nears the goal,\r\n    Whose indefatigable pen\r\n    Stirs envy in us younger men----\"\r\n\r\nSo has Mr. Charles Graves addressed him, and so might others feel a\r\nnoble envy.\r\n\r\nGreat Bookham, less than a mile away, was once the home of another\r\nwriter. Fanny Burney lived there for four years after she had married\r\nGeneral d'Arblay, and the two of them with their baby, and an income of\r\nL125, were superlatively happy. Here she wrote _Camilla_, which was to\r\nbuild and to christen the house she lived in later, and it was from\r\nBookham that she set out to take the first bound copies to King George\r\nand the Queen at Windsor. \"About how much time did you give to it?\"\r\nasked the good-natured King, and \"Are you much frightened? As much\r\nfrightened as you were before?\" The Queen asked M. and Madame d'Arblay\r\nto dine the next day, and in the interval the General, having been\r\nintroduced to the Queen's gardener at Frogmore, \"a skilful and famous\r\nbotanist,\" consulted him seriously about the Bookham cabbages. M.\r\nd'Arblay was a gardener of greater courage than science. His wife sends\r\nher father a picture of the work done among the Bookham fruits and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\"Our garden,\" she writes, \"is not yet quite the most profitable thing in\r\nthe world; but M. d'A. assures me it is to be the staff of our table and\r\nexistence.\" But M. d'Arblay had very little luck. He planted\r\nstrawberries hoping to gather fruit within three months, and was\r\ndisappointed:--\r\n\r\n    \"Another time, too, with great labour, he cleared a considerable\r\n    compartment of weeds, and, when it looked clean and well, and he\r\n    showed his work to the gardener, the man said he had demolished an\r\n    asparagus bed! M. d'Arblay protested, however, nothing could look\r\n    more like _des mauvaises herbes_.\r\n\r\n    \"His greatest passion is for transplanting. Everything we possess he\r\n    moves from one end of the garden to another, to produce better\r\n    effects. Roses take place of jessamines, jessamines of honeysuckles,\r\n    and honeysuckles of lilies, till they have all danced round as far\r\n    as the space allows; but whether the effect may not be a general\r\n    mortality, summer only can determine.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of the General turning his sword into a reaping hook is even\r\nmore alluring:--\r\n\r\n    \"I wish you had seen him yesterday, mowing down our hedge--with his\r\n    sabre, and with an air and attitudes so military, that, if he had\r\n    been hewing down other legions than those he encountered--_i.e._ of\r\n    spiders--he could scarcely have had a mien more tremendous, or have\r\n    demanded an arm more mighty. Heaven knows, I am 'the most _contente\r\n    personne_ in the world' to see his sabre so employed!\"\r\n\r\nThe garden in which these severely military operations took place still\r\nsurrounds the same windows, gay with wistaria and roses. Possibly the\r\ngnarled apple trees which fringe the lawn are actual survivors of the\r\ngeneral's sabre.\r\n\r\nGreat Bookham has grown a good deal since the d'Arblays knew it. But the\r\nsplendid shell of an ancient elm still shades the churchyard gate; the\r\nflint-walled church, with ivy bunched over its buttressed tower, and\r\nlichens glowing on the Horsham slabs of its chapel roof, can have\r\nchanged but little. Two or three of its monuments are interesting. One\r\nis a brass plate recounting the virtues and the pedigree of Edmund\r\nSlyfield and his wife Elizabeth. They were of Slyfield Place; he was \"a\r\nstoute Esquire who alwaies set God's feare before his Eyes\"; she was a\r\nmodel of all the graces, and descended from the Paulets, Capells,\r\nSydneys, Gainsfords, Finches, Arundels, Whites, and Lamberts--a good\r\nlong list to bring into an epitaph, but there are twenty-eight lines of\r\nhonest doggerel to do it in. Another monument is quite as striking,\r\nwhich represents Colonel Thomas Moore in the full uniform of the\r\ncommanding officer of a regiment of foot in the reign of Queen Anne,\r\nwhich the sculptor's convention has idealised into a mixture of a\r\nbathing costume, a kilt, and a plaid. The church, indeed, is a museum of\r\nrecords of different times and tastes to a degree uncommon in far more\r\nimportant buildings. In the east wall of the chancel is a slab\r\ncommemorating in three Latin hexameters the founding of the building by\r\nJohn de Rutherwyk, the great Abbot whom we meet at Chertsey; and the\r\neast window of the Slyfield chapel is dedicated, in a long, biographical\r\ninscription in brass, to the memory of Lord Raglan, who as Fitzroy James\r\nHenry Somerset, military secretary to the Duke of Wellington, lost an\r\narm at the Duke's side at Waterloo, and forty years later commanded the\r\nBritish army in the East before Sebastopol, where he died. Lord\r\nRaglan's connection with Great Bookham is slight: but his niece, Lady\r\nMary Farquhar, who put up the window, lived at Polesden, a mile or two\r\naway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Slyfield Place._]\r\n\r\nLast of the villages on the road from Guildford to Leatherhead is\r\nFetcham. A park, a road bordered by cottages and a pretty house or two,\r\nand a battlemented church-tower deep among yews, and hollies, and\r\nivy-trees--Fetcham is as pleasantly small and quiet as her western\r\nneighbours. But what a string of churches it is, along these twelve\r\nmiles of Surrey roadway; nine villages, each with its grey-walled\r\nbuilding and the cool whiteness of the arches, aisles, and chancels. No\r\npilgrim of the old centuries could tire on such a journey. To-day he\r\nmight. Only four of the church doors give him a welcome.\r\n\r\nAbove Fetcham's church, which, like Stoke D'Abernon and one or two\r\nothers, fronts on the flowers and lawns of a private garden, great\r\nbunches of mistletoe darken the winter tree-tops. Fetcham is on the\r\nborder of the mistletoe country, which stretches from Leatherhead to\r\nDorking and Boxhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGODALMING\r\n\r\n    A country town.--Peter the Great's breakfast.--Pykes in the\r\n    Wey.--Dogs and fish-carts.--Off to Botany Bay.--Owen Manning.--A\r\n    most malignant priest.--Eashing Bridges.--Peperharow deer.--Loseley\r\n    from a distance.--Charterhouse in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best view of Godalming is from the hill roads above Farncombe. Not\r\nmany towns group themselves so well against hills and woods; few have so\r\nspacious and quiet a foreground. The church stands on the Wey; the\r\nchurchyard runs down to the very banks, and the noble leaded spire lifts\r\nits chanticleer higher, I think, from the tower than any other church in\r\nSurrey. Between the foot of the hill and the Wey spreads wide\r\nmeadowland; the Wey flows tranquilly by willow-herb and alder; beyond\r\nthe Wey are the red roofs of Godalming clustered in the trees. It is the\r\ncompletest little country town; the green fields in front and the woods\r\nbeyond set it compact together, clustered as a country town should be\r\nabout its church and its High Street, with the river running clear at\r\nits side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _On the Way to Godalming from Haslemere._]\r\n\r\nGodalming High Street has not kept the grace of Guildford, nor had it\r\never the width and the air of Epsom or Farnham, but it has more than one\r\nbuilding of distinction, and its links with the past are in old inns,\r\ntimbered stories and forgotten courts. The White Hart still juts its\r\nwooden beams over the pavement; the King's Arms, a later building, has a\r\nsquare-set front which has watched many coaches jangle off to\r\nPortsmouth. The King's Arms has had more than one king as a guest. The\r\nEmperor Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William of Prussia\r\ndined there in the year before Waterloo; a more famous and a more\r\ngreedy monarch who knew the King's Arms was Peter the Great in the days\r\nof Queen Anne. He had a suite of twenty with him, and the record of his\r\nbill of fare for the day is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. I have\r\nnot seen it, but the historians who have supply abounding details. Peter\r\nand his twenty had for breakfast besides side-dishes, half a sheep, half\r\na lamb, ten pullets, a dozen chickens, seven dozen eggs and something\r\nover a quart apiece of mulled wine, with a gallon or so of brandy.\r\nDinner was a better meal; three stone of ribs of beef was the main dish,\r\nwith a sheep, a lamb, and a couple of joints of veal to help it out;\r\ncapons and rabbits tempted the jaded, and four dozen of sack and wine\r\nmade up for what was lacking at breakfast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Town Hall, Godalming._]\r\n\r\nBesides the inns, two old houses in particular set their mark on the\r\nHigh Street. One is dated 1663; both are of rich brickwork, almost\r\nextravagantly ornate with ledges, patterned courses, elaborate parapets\r\nand casements. The unhappy addition is the paint. If they had never been\r\npainted, or if the paint could be done away with, the pattern would take\r\non twice its charm. But that is the main regret for all Godalming. If\r\nthe High Street could have its false fronts pulled down, and all its old\r\ntimber and brick shown to the road, it would fascinate as Guildford\r\ndoes. It would be worth the town's while to spend money to show what it\r\npossesses of older centuries. But that is a frequent reflection in other\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Timbered House in the Market Place, Godalming._]\r\n\r\nOne memory of the past has survived the attacks of Godalming's newest\r\nand noisiest citizens. The little Town Hall, built squarely in the\r\nmiddle of the road at the west end of the High Street on the site of an\r\nolder building, has been threatened by a section (I am told) of\r\nGodalming tradesmen for many years, and would tremble still, if it were\r\nnot so solidly built of good Georgian brick. It is said to be awkward\r\nfor motor traffic, to be not handsome, and generally to be out of date\r\nand in the way. As to its looks, it belongs to 1814, and is plain and\r\nsimple enough, but it carries a graceful clock tower and a copper\r\ncupola, and its destruction is not to be thought of. The day has gone\r\nfor wanton throwing into the past what the past has left, and the\r\nlittle Town Hall will continue to slow down the traffic and draw\r\nvisitors to the High Street, it is to be hoped, for many years to come.\r\nThe town corporation have done better for themselves than to pull down\r\nthe old Town Hall. They have set up some modern buildings for town\r\nbusiness, which for good work in good material are as excellent a modern\r\naddition as could have been made to any old town.\r\n\r\nGodalming's history, like Guildford's and Wonersh's, has been largely\r\nthe history of the wool industry. It was Godalming's careless trust in\r\nthe stability of its contractor, Samuel Vassall, which dealt the first\r\nand shrewdest blow at its business, as we saw at Guildford. But\r\nGodalming kept its head higher than the other two for a time. In Bowen's\r\nmap of Surrey, drawn in 1749, the printer has put a little side-note\r\nexplaining Godalming's capabilities to the curious, and you read that\r\nfor the manufacture of clothing, \"it is the most considerable town in\r\nthe county. The sorts are mixed Kerseys, and Blue ones, for the Canary\r\nIslands, which for their Colours, can't be matched in any other Part of\r\nEngland.\" But that is not all; Bowen adds an afterthought--\"Here is\r\nplenty of good fish, especially Pykes. Here are two or three Paper\r\nMills, and three Corn Mills.\" So Godalming had food and clothing too.\r\nShe still markets woollen goods, but the pykes, I fear, gave out long\r\nago. Men fish in the Wey at Godalming as they fish at Guildford and\r\nWeybridge, but they seldom catch a pyke, I know, for I have watched\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFish have had other associations with Godalming besides swimming in the\r\nWey. Miss Gertrude Jekyll, who has written so much of Surrey gardens,\r\nand has her own wonderful garden at Munstead not much more than a mile\r\naway, has described in her fascinating book, _Old West Surrey_, the\r\ncarrying of fish for the London market from the seaport towns through\r\nGodalming. It was taken in special fish-vans. \"They were painted yellow\r\nand had four horses. But some of it, as well as supplies for other\r\ninland places, was carried in little carts drawn by dogs. The dogs were\r\nbig, strong Newfoundlands. Teams of two or four were harnessed together.\r\nThe team of four would carry three to four hundredweight of fish,\r\nbesides the driver. The man would 'cock his legs up along the sharves,'\r\nas an old friend describes it, and away they would go at a great rate.\r\nThey not only went as fast as the coaches, but they gained time when\r\nthe coach stopped to change horses, and so got the pick of the market. A\r\ndog-drawn cart used to bring fish from Littlehampton to Godalming, where\r\noysters were often to be bought for three a penny.\" Three a penny, fresh\r\noysters! Fourpence a dozen all alive! The street cries must have been\r\nmost encouraging.\r\n\r\nOther memories of old Godalming Miss Jekyll has preserved, one of them\r\nher own, of a carrier-cart plying between Bramley and Guildford drawn by\r\ndogs. Then there were the coaches that stopped at the King's Arms and\r\nthe Red Lion and other inns; Godalming, on the road to Portsmouth, saw\r\ntraffic which was merry and miserable. Sometimes a coach would swing\r\ninto the town carrying sixteen sailors, four inside and twelve out, paid\r\noff from a man-of-war and going to London to spend their money. They\r\nwould walk back. Sometimes a midnight coach would bring unhappier\r\npassengers; gangs of convicts in chains would be given something to eat\r\nat the Red Lion; or the yard gates of the King's Arms would be closed,\r\nand armed warders would let out their prisoners for a little rest on the\r\nway to Botany Bay. But the sailors were the merry folk. They would\r\nbrandish their bottles and cheer, and sometimes, when the coach swayed,\r\nwould swing with it as sailors should on a sloping deck; then the coach\r\nturned over.\r\n\r\nRestorers in 1840, that unhappy age for beautiful old buildings, did\r\nwhat they could to spoil Godalming's parish church. They packed it from\r\nfloor to roof with pews and galleries, knocked off a porch here, a\r\nchantry there, doubled its accommodation and quartered its charm.\r\nThirty-nine years later Sir Gilbert Scott and Mr. Ralph Nevill did their\r\nbest to repair the injury and show the Norman pillars as they should be,\r\nbut some of the injury done was final. Still, the church within and\r\nwithout is a noble building, and the leaden spire which soars up from\r\nthe tower is the finest in the county. The church has had at least three\r\nfamous vicars. One was Owen Manning, famous perhaps against his will,\r\nfor he asked that no monument for him should be added to the church. His\r\nepitaph should be _Si monumentum requiris_, _perlege_, for he was the\r\noriginator and part author of the history of the county which was\r\nfinished, as we saw at Shere, by William Bray. Owen Manning's was a\r\ngreat mind, but he had a great heart as well; for the work he did for\r\nhis book sent him blind at seventy-five, and he bore five more years of\r\nlife knowing that he had not been suffered to finish what he had begun.\r\nHe died in 1801; and there is a curious story that he was nearly buried\r\nalive when he was a boy. He had had the small-pox and was actually laid\r\nout for dead. His father went in to see him, raised him in his arms\r\nsaying, \"I will give my dear boy another chance,\" and as he did so, saw\r\nsigns of returning life.\r\n\r\nAnother vicar was Samuel Speed, grandson of the John Speed who made the\r\nmaps, and at one time he was chaplain of the fleet when Lord Ossory\r\nfought the Dutch. Sir John Birkenhead immortalised him in a ballad on\r\nthe fight:--\r\n\r\n    His chaplain, he plyed his wonted work,\r\n    He prayed like a Christian, and fought like a Turk,\r\n    Crying now for the King, and the Duke of York,\r\n          With a thump, a thump, thump!\r\n\r\nAnother of Godalming's clergy was the Reverend Nicholas Andrewes, who\r\ncame into severe collisions with his parishioners. They petitioned\r\nParliament against being compelled to bear with him any longer. They\r\ncharged him among other offences with \"preachinge but seldom, and then\r\nalsoe but in a verie fruytlesse and unprofitable mann^r.\" They urged\r\nthat he was \"a Haunter, and frequenter of tiplinge in Innes, and\r\ntavernes, and useth gameinge both at cards and Table as well uppon the\r\nLords dayes as others.\" They accused him of having declined to church\r\none Mrs. Buckley \"when she came to church and sate there all the tyme of\r\ndyvine service, because she was not attyred wi^th an hanginge kerchief.\"\r\nThey said that he kept a curious crucifix \"in a Boxe wi^th foldinge\r\nwindowes.\" Finally, John Monger and John Tichborne alleged \"that the\r\nsaid vicar and M^r. Wayferar, Parson of Compton, in the said Countie of\r\nSurry, roade to Southampton, to eate Fishe and to make merrie togeather,\r\nand there (dyverse tymes) drank healthes to the Pope calling him that\r\nhonest olde man.\" So much, and more, the parishioners had to say against\r\nhim. He was decided to be a Malignant Priest; White, in his _First\r\nCentury of Scandalous and Malignant Ministers_, arraigns him, among\r\nother offences, for having \"expressed himself to be an enemy to frequent\r\npreaching, inveighing in his sermons against long Sermons, saying that\r\nPeters sword cut off but one eare, but long Sermons like long swords\r\ncut off both at once, and that the Surfeit of the Word is of all most\r\ndangerous, and that the silliest creatures have longest eares, and that\r\npreaching was the worst part of God's worship, and that if he left out\r\nanything he would leave out that.\" And that, for Mr. Andrewes, was the\r\nend; a man who lost his living because he would rather pray than preach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Church Street, Godalming._]\r\n\r\nTwo women have left records behind them, one strange and the other\r\ncruel, in the parish annals. One was a remarkable person named Mary\r\nTofts, wife of a clothworker, who in 1726 professed to have had a\r\nlamentable misadventure. She asserted that while she was weeding in a\r\nfield she was startled by a rabbit jumping up near her, and that\r\nsubsequently, she presented her husband, instead of a fine boy, with\r\nquantities of rabbits. The effect of the announcement was prodigious.\r\nMore than one well-known physician believed her implicitly; pamphlets\r\nwere published on clinics, Hogarth printed a cut of the Wise Men of\r\nGodlyman; nobody would eat a rabbit; at last Queen Caroline ended the\r\nbusiness by sending her own doctor to investigate, and Mary Tofts was\r\nlodged in Bridewell. Another poor woman deceived less and was punished\r\nmore. The parish registers hold the record.\r\n\r\n    Aprill the 26^th 1658. Heare was taken a vagrant, one Mary Parker,\r\n    Widow with a Child, and she was wipped according to law, about the\r\n    age of Thirty years, proper of personage; and she was to goo to the\r\n    place of her birth, that is in Grauesend in Kent, and she is\r\n    limitted to iiij days, and to be carried from Tithing to Tything\r\n    tell she comes to the end of the s^d jerney.\r\n\r\nA reformer of prison discipline, who was a native of Godalming, would\r\nhave read the entry with rage. General Oglethorpe, founder of the colony\r\nof Georgia, and originator of the inquiry into the state of the Fleet\r\nand Marshalsea prisons, was born at Westbrook in Godalming forty years\r\nafter Godalming beat the woman through its friendless streets. We meet\r\nGeneral Oglethorpe at Haslemere; perhaps if he had lived earlier he\r\nwould have dared to lift his hand against the savage Elizabethan law.\r\n\r\nHow could a town assent to such shame, and yet maintain on its outskirts\r\nan almshouse? Godalming's almshouse is a long low building of red brick,\r\nstanding behind a white gate and some elms on the road by Farncombe. It\r\nwas founded by Richard Wyatt, a rich Londoner, three times Master of the\r\nCarpenters' Company, and the inscription over the entrance stands as he\r\nmade it:--\r\n\r\n    \"This Oyspitall was given by M^r. Richard Wyatt of London, Esq.: for\r\n    tenn poore men w^th sueficient lands to it for y^ier mayntenance for\r\n    eve^r, 1622.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Eashing._]\r\n\r\nFarncombe is Godalming's suburb, and from above its hilly streets can be\r\nhad a strangely romantic view of the valley by Guildford, with St.\r\nMartha's chapel crowning the hill. From Farncombe, too, you may take one\r\nof the prettiest walks of all by the Wey, through rich fields of grass\r\nennobled with bordering elms, and with the Wey running here level with\r\nyou through meadowsweet and iris, and here below the footpath, seen\r\nthrough the trees. If you push up stream, you will come to Eashing\r\nBridge, one of the oldest and strongest of Surrey bridges, and now a\r\nnational possession, secured from attacks of brick and iron by the\r\nSociety for Preserving Places of Historic Interest--an admirable\r\nSociety. Eashing Bridge, or rather Bridges, for it crosses the Wey\r\ntwice, and has more than five buttresses standing in the water, has\r\nstood over the Wey for more than seven centuries. The old engineers\r\nperhaps built over a stronger Wey than to-day's, for they made the\r\nbuttresses that point up stream to divide the water; on the other side\r\nthey are round and blunt. The time to stand on Eashing Bridge is when it\r\nis quietest, on a Sunday morning. Up stream is the mill, humming out one\r\nof the best of all songs of water; to the left is a row of timbered\r\ncottages, cream-painted brick and black beams, and gay when I saw them\r\non a blue August morning with sweet peas and dahlias; a villager and his\r\nwife gathered fruit in a garden banked above the road, and\r\nwhite-frocked, black-stockinged children sat demurely in the cottage\r\ndoorways. But there is a patch of corrugated iron by the Eashing\r\ncottages and bridge which calls for a Society of Destroyers.\r\n\r\nGodalming has two fine parks for neighbours, Peperharow and Loseley.\r\nPeperharow, which became the first Lord Midleton's in 1712, once\r\nbelonged to Sir Bernard Brocas, who was Master of the Buckhounds to\r\nRichard II; afterwards it came to the great family of the Coverts.\r\nPeperharow Park has its own church, but the beauty of the place is in\r\nthe parkland itself, with its noble trees and stretches of grass, and\r\nthe Wey running through it down to Eashing. Deer wander in the sunshine\r\nthere, dark and comely under the great cedars, or grazing slowly and\r\nsedately by the banks of the stream. One might walk out from Godalming\r\nonly to watch the Peperharow deer; but a walk beyond the park brings\r\nanother pleasure. Above Peperharow the Wey is bridged again, by stone as\r\nold, I think, as at Eashing: the buttress of the main part of the bridge\r\nis the same shape as Eashing's. Above the bridge is a fall built across\r\nthe stream: only a few inches of masonry, but it changes the stream\r\ncompletely. The higher water is a broad, shadowy pool, cooled and\r\ndarkened by alders meeting overhead and dipping in the water; below, the\r\nshallow water ripples over stones, as clear and black as a northern\r\nsalmon stream. The difference between the Wey here and the Wey at\r\nEashing or Tilford is, of course its bed. The Wey runs over as many beds\r\nas any little river in England; here it races over clean ironstone.\r\n\r\nLoseley has a longer story than Peperharow, and Loseley House is a very\r\nfine old Tudor building, the best, perhaps, in Surrey, after Sutton. Sir\r\nWilliam More built most of it, and took much of the stone from Waverley\r\nAbbey, for which it would be difficult to forgive him if he had made a\r\nless beautiful house. Sir William More was son of Sir Christopher,\r\nSheriff of Surrey and Sussex under Henry VIII. Sir Christopher first had\r\nthe estate in 1515; at the Domesday Survey the Earl of Arundel had it.\r\nThe family history of the Mores is too long for a chapter; so would be a\r\ndetailed list of the furniture and pictures of the house, some of which\r\nare catalogued in the guide-books, though the general public may see\r\nthem but seldom. The house has had royal visitors; Queen Elizabeth came\r\nto see Sir William More there, and King James and his son were both\r\nguests of Sir George More, Sir William's son. It was Sir George More who\r\nwas so furious with his daughter for marrying John Donne, though he\r\nlived to be good enough to forgive her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Wey above Peperharow._]\r\n\r\nI like to look at these great houses from a distance. When one enters a\r\nhouse that has been used by an historic family for generations, the\r\nfirst thing that demands attention is far more often than not something\r\nnew, an alteration, an adaptation of old means to new methods. The mark\r\nset on the house is of the living, and the fascination of it belongs to\r\nother years gone. But distance blots out all the innovations; the haze\r\nof half a mile sets it in the landscape as it has stood for centuries. I\r\nlike to look at Loseley from the dusty, forgotten places of the old\r\npilgrims' road passing at the boundary of the park; not that the\r\npilgrims ever saw Loseley, but the old countrymen still using the road\r\nwould have seen it first, perhaps, from that ancient trackway, and have\r\nwondered what manner of man its master might be, and how much he paid\r\nfor the building of it, and whether the King or the Queen would be\r\ncoming to Loseley again soon. That is the Loseley they would have seen;\r\na noble dwelling of grey gables and spacious windows, looking over broad\r\nparkland and wide water with red cattle standing in it, flicking at the\r\nflies with their tails. So, perhaps, would Henry Wriothesley, second\r\nEarl of Southampton, have looked at Loseley from a distance, when\r\nElizabeth sent him there, the Papist prisoner of Sir William More. He\r\nwould have glanced doubtfully up and down the old road and wondered over\r\nthe hopelessness of escape.\r\n\r\nGodalming's nearest, and in point of size, its greatest neighbour is\r\nCharterhouse. Charterhouse is the name; the buildings are not yet forty\r\nyears old. The school moved from Aldersgate to the hill above Godalming\r\nin 1872, and took the memories of Addison, Steele, and Thackeray with it\r\nin its museum and library. The Charterhouse buildings belong to the\r\nfuture. Centuries will add the grace of dulness to its new stone; trees\r\nwill grow round its cricket ground, distance will set a haze round the\r\nnames of its Surrey schoolboys; it will have venerable wood, there will\r\nbe legends of the passages and the stairs; the doors will have been\r\ndarkened by great men; there will be a film and a glory of years about\r\nits chapel. To-day it is admirably arranged, hygienic beyond praise:\r\nthen it will be an old building as well as an old school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View from Hindhead._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHASLEMERE AND HINDHEAD\r\n\r\n    Six hundred feet up.--Haslemere's Museum.--A strange Tomb.--The\r\n    Lion.--The Cow.--Snipes in Conduit Street.--Shottermill\r\n    Trout.--Hindhead.--The Riddle of a Crime.--A deserted Road.--The\r\n    View from Gibbet Hill.--Airly Beacon.--The Broom Squire.--Highcombe\r\n    Bottom.--Pheasants, Tadpoles, and Swifts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHindhead commands the south-west corner of the county, but Haslemere is\r\nthe key to it. You cannot walk away from Hindhead and take a train back\r\nif you want to, which you ought always to be able to do from a centre.\r\nBesides, to return to Hindhead is to end with a steep hill to climb;\r\ncoming back to Haslemere, you can either drop down the hill from\r\nHindhead, or the railway will carry you uphill to the little town from\r\nMilford or Witley down the line.\r\n\r\nIt is really uphill, for Haslemere lies higher than any town in the\r\nsouth of England--or is said to do so; I have not measured them all. I\r\nthink Tatsfield and Woldingham in the east of the county lie higher; but\r\nthey are villages, not towns. Haslemere is between five and six hundred\r\nfeet above sea level; as high as Newlands Corner and nearly three times\r\nthe height of St. George's or St. Anne's Hill. If Hindhead were sliced\r\naway, Haslemere's view to the north would be superb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haslemere._]\r\n\r\nHaslemere has strayed higher and higher on the slopes above the old\r\ntown. The core lies round a broad street in which the White Horse faces\r\nthe Swan, and the town hall stands between them, a rather dull little\r\nbuilding, in the middle of the road. The town has kept less of the past\r\nthan Farnham; perhaps it had less to keep; but it has some good red\r\nseventeenth-century houses, weather-tiled gables, and tall brick\r\nchimneys. Toadflax and arabis climb over the old garden walls: one\r\nlittle house looks as if its walls were held together by coils of\r\nwistaria. In another, a square, comfortable building with an elaborate\r\ndoorway, lived the water-colour painter and wood engraver, Josiah Wood\r\nWhymper, father of the Whymper whom a later generation knows best as a\r\npainter of animals and game birds.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting interior in Haslemere is the museum. It was\r\npresented to the town by Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson, and teaches history,\r\ngeology, botany and everything to do with Haslemere's (and other) birds,\r\nbeasts, and reptiles. You may study the development of the world from\r\nthe birth of life perhaps thirty-one million years ago--that is the age\r\nHaslemere teaches--down to the present day. Skulls of elephants,\r\nantelopes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, gorillas and giraffes instruct\r\nthe zoologist; local vipers and grass snakes curl in spirits of wine;\r\nstuffed quadrupeds, including a large kangaroo, illustrate climates\r\nforeign to Haslemere; local ornithologists contribute cases of the birds\r\nof the neighbourhood. Witley sends a case of crossbills; twenty years\r\nago a pair of hen harriers--or are they Montagu's harriers?--were killed\r\non Hindhead; a blackcock guards his grey hen, and was shot not far away.\r\nAre blackcock extinct in Surrey? The last Lord Midleton wrote to _The\r\nTimes_ some years ago to state his belief that they were. At Frensham I\r\nwas told that the last pair were shot in 1889. But Mr. E.D. Swanton, the\r\ncurator of the Haslemere Museum, learned in everything that a museum\r\nshould hold, from Celtic pottery to caterpillars, told me when I was at\r\nHaslemere that he had seen a pair (I write in 1908) only two years ago.\r\nHe was not at all certain that there were no more blackcocks in the\r\ncounty. But I fear the villas have been too much for them.\r\n\r\nThe church stands a little apart from the town, and holds two very\r\ndifferent memorials. One is the Burne-Jones window to the memory of\r\nTennyson, who lived at Aldworth on Black Down over the border; the other\r\nis a strange, rough heap of peat and heather, piled inside the gate of\r\nthe churchyard. Under it lies John Tyndall. He was one of the\r\ndiscoverers of Hindhead as a place to live in instead of merely a hill\r\nto climb; the tragedy of his death is a recent memory. It was his wish\r\nthat his grave should be no more than a mound of heather, but such\r\nwishes can end unhappily. If the grave is neglected, perhaps that is\r\nwhat he hoped it would be; but neglect, can grow into something worse.\r\nWhen I last saw the grave--perhaps on an unfortunate day--the heather\r\nhad somehow collected newspapers and empty jampots; it looked like soon\r\nbecoming a rubbish heap.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ visited Haslemere in 1801 and\r\ndescribed the painted glass in the windows. One of them he catalogued\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    \"Offering of the Wise Men. Among the numerous presents, I\r\n    distinguished some fine hams, poultry, and mutton.\"\r\n\r\nA recent inspection fails to distinguish among the numerous presents\r\neither fine hams or mutton.\r\n\r\nYears ago Haslemere had a lion. It was an old beech tree, twenty feet in\r\ngirth, and the late Louis Jennings, in his _Field Paths and Green\r\nLanes_, tells us that since Murray's _Handbook_ spoke of a lion, he\r\nsearched for it for long, and when he found it he was disappointed.\r\nTo-day it is a stump, or is said to be, but nobody could show it me; I\r\nam sure I looked for it longer than Louis Jennings, but I never found\r\nit. All I found was what will perhaps some day grow into another lion--a\r\nbeech tree and a holly apparently growing from the same root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Porch at Haslemere Church._]\r\n\r\nHaslemere's history is mostly political, and not always very\r\nrespectable. Elizabeth, perhaps, made the village a borough; at all\r\nevents, two members sat for Haslemere first in the Parliament of 1584,\r\nand two members represented the borough until it was unkindly abolished\r\nby the reforms of 1832. Some of its members came of old Surrey\r\nfamilies--Carews, Mores, Oglethorpes, Onslows, Evelyns; and some of its\r\nelections were highly irregular. One of the most successful pieces of\r\njobbery stands to the credit of the year 1754, when the Tory sitting\r\nmembers, General Oglethorpe and Peter Burrell, were opposed by two\r\nWhigs, James More Molyneux and Philip Carteret Webb, a London lawyer.\r\nMolyneux and Webb were elected by 73 votes to 45, but some at least of\r\nthe 73 (perhaps also some of the 45) would not have borne strict\r\ninvestigation. Eight of the winning votes were faggot votes manufactured\r\nout of the Cow Inn, of Haslemere, which inspired Dr. William King,\r\nPrincipal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, to a ballad of forty-two verses,\r\nentitled _The Cow of Haslemere, or The Conjurer's Secretary at Oxford_.\r\nDr. King liked politics in poetry to be hot and strong, thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"No Man could hear,\r\n    But he must fear\r\n    Her loud infernal Roar,\r\n    Such horrid Lies,\r\n    And Blasphemies\r\n    She bellow'd out and swore.\r\n\r\n    But what must make\r\n    The stoutest quake,\r\n    And all with Horror gape,\r\n    At one strange Birth,\r\n    This Cow cast forth\r\n    Eight Calves in human Shape.\r\n\r\n    For in this Cow\r\n    Each did somehow\r\n    A Tenement possess,\r\n    How big this Beast\r\n    Must be at least\r\n    From hence, Sirs, ye may guess.\r\n\r\n    The Crew march'd out,\r\n    An horrid Rout,\r\n    No Bear's Cubs could be bolder!\r\n    Each calf did vote,\r\n    And swear by Rote\r\n    He was a good Freeholder.\"\r\n\r\nOne, at least, of Haslemere's members was more than a mere party\r\npolitician. General James Edward Oglethorpe, who was defeated on the\r\noccasion of the Cow's remarkable parturition, was the son of a former\r\nmember, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, and sat for Haslemere from 1722 till\r\nhe was beaten at the poll. He was the great philanthropist of his day;\r\nhe was the generous and active friend of imprisoned debtors; he was the\r\nfounder of the colony of Georgia, and a general who held a position with\r\n650 men against 5,000 Spaniards. It was General Oglethorpe who obtained\r\nan inquiry by Parliament into the management of the Fleet and Marshalsea\r\nprisons. A friend of his named Castell had been thrown into the Fleet\r\nfor debt, and because he could not pay the warder's dues had been shut\r\nin a house where the small-pox was raging: he took the disease and died.\r\nOglethorpe was thoroughly roused, and the inquiry held into the gaol\r\nsystem of the country was the beginning of his work for debtors and\r\nprisoners. Later, he got Parliamentary sanction and large sums of money\r\nto found a colony of emigrant debtors in the New World, made friends\r\nwith the Creek and the Choctaw Indians, fought the Spaniards, and\r\nplanted the roots of his little settlement so firmly that he lived to\r\nsee Georgia acknowledged by the Mother Country as a sovereign\r\nindependent State.\r\n\r\nSome years ago there was an exhibition of Old Haslemere held at the\r\nMuseum, of which Mr. Swanton very kindly gave me particulars. One of the\r\npictures lent by Mr. J.W. Penfold, an old, if not the oldest,\r\ninhabitant, shows General Oglethorpe with the accompanying\r\nnote:-\"General James Oglethorpe. Died 30th June, 1785, Aged 102, said to\r\nbe the oldest General in Europe. Sketched from life at the sale of Dr.\r\nJohnson's books, February 18, 1785, where the General was reading a book\r\nhe had purchased without spectacles. In 1706 he had an Ensign Commission\r\nin the Guards, and remember'd to have shot snipes in Conduit Mead, where\r\nConduit Street now stands.\" The compiler of the note may have been right\r\nabout the snipes, but he was wrong about the General's age, for he was\r\nno more than 96. But the admirable caution of the phrase \"said to be\"\r\nremains on record.\r\n\r\nWhen Haslemere was finally deprived of its two members, the local\r\nreformers were jubilant. One of them, in _The Burial of the Boroughs_,\r\nprinted at Petersfield in 1832, burst into verse:--\r\n\r\n    \"Old Borough-bridge is broken down,\r\n      In spite of its proud pier;\r\n    And Seaford, too, is just dry'd up,\r\n      And so is Hasle-mere.\r\n\r\n    It is not strange they've damn'd Newport,\r\n      It is such cursed trash;\r\n    And where's the gourmand would complain\r\n      For kicking out Salt-ash.\r\n\r\n    Toll, toll: these Boroughs ne'er will be\r\n      By us through life forgotten;\r\n    Nor will their patrons when they lie,\r\n      Just like their Boroughs, rotten.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the burial of the rotten boroughs came the railway, and a long\r\ntime after the railway the artists and authors. Most of them climbed\r\nfurther, up to Hindhead, but Haslemere kept a few. Mrs. Allingham\r\npainted the Haslemere fish-shop and other village scenes, though she\r\nlived nearer Witley than Haslemere. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle played\r\ncricket for Haslemere till he went up the hill: Dr. George Macdonald\r\nbuilt a house on the London road: the Whympers we have met. Tennyson's\r\nmemorial is in the church, but Tennyson's was a Sussex home, on\r\nBlackdown.\r\n\r\nShottermill joins Haslemere on the west, and has had its own author.\r\nGeorge Eliot wrote much of _Middlemarch_ in a cottage near the church.\r\nFishermen know Shottermill, for its hillsides are ladders of small\r\nponds, in which tens of thousands of trout have been bred for other,\r\nwilder streams. The Surrey Trout Farm began its existence in one of\r\nthese chains of ponds; its farmers breed their Loch Levens and rainbows\r\nnow, I think, in another chain. What is the _metier_ of a trout farm?\r\nWho shall decide? There are fishermen who would never knowingly throw a\r\nfly over a trout that had been hand-fed with chopped horseflesh; and\r\nthere are other fishermen who, if there were no trout farms, would never\r\nhave anything to fish for. The ponds have their own fascination; not,\r\nperhaps, at meal-times, when the water is lashed to froth by the\r\ndarting, gleaming bodies--that is too greedy a business. But when a\r\npasser-by on a spring morning sees a pound fish fall back into the water\r\nwith a meditative flop, he may pay the pond the compliment of wishing\r\nhimself elsewhere. One accompaniment of a trout farm he may hope to\r\nescape--the sight of a dead kingfisher. Without wire netting,\r\nkingfishers find out the young fry only too quickly, and a dead\r\nkingfisher spoils all pleasure for a fisherman.\r\n\r\nAnd so, from Haslemere by a rough path up the hill, or through\r\nShottermill by a straight main road, or a shady lane grown over with\r\nalmost every tree of hedgerows and woods, we come to Hindhead. There are\r\nmany ways to the top, and these, though in some ways the most\r\nconvenient, are not the best. But the best, which is to reach it by the\r\nold Portsmouth road from Thursley, can be kept for later in the day. The\r\nworst way to see Hindhead is to follow the motor-cars up the main road.\r\nThe motor-cars see the road, but never Hindhead at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brookbank Cottage, Shottermill, where George Eliot lived\r\nfor a time._]\r\n\r\nHindhead is the most superb and the most disappointing thing in Surrey.\r\nA quarter of a century ago it was wild moorland; then Professor Tyndall\r\nproclaimed that since he could not go to the Bel Alp, he would go to the\r\nnext best place, and from that day the hill has changed to streets,\r\nvillas, and hotels. London arrives every Saturday: London swarms on\r\nSunday. But you can still see, or can guess, something of the grandeur\r\nand loneliness of the place; best, perhaps, on the east and the northern\r\nslopes towards Thursley; most fully, alone on the highest point, Gibbet\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nHindhead, before the town came there, had a grisly sound in the name.\r\nThe Hindhead murder has grown from a sordid case of robbery and killing\r\ninto one of the great crimes of English local history. Nothing would\r\nhave seemed less likely to the murderers. Probably not one of them could\r\nread or write; perhaps any sensible calculation of the chances of escape\r\nwas beyond them; possibly they never planned the murder at all. Their\r\ncrime, in a sense, was paltry; if it had never been discovered, there\r\nwould have been no further consequences; no one but the murdered man, so\r\nfar as can be told, was injured; the man was never missed nor owned by a\r\nfriend. The murder of a king reshapes history; an assassinated Minister\r\nmay change a Constitution; the killing of this man, apparently, mattered\r\nto no single living soul. Yet his murderers, in all their clumsiness and\r\nignorance, contrived a crime which should be talked of daily for a\r\ncentury, and should have its separate, distinct record in stone when a\r\nthousand plots and passions of regicides and usurpers should be as clean\r\nforgotten as if their record had never stained blank paper.\r\n\r\nWhere is the permanent quality? Perhaps it is murder isolated, set\r\nexactly in the light which means and belongs to murder, in the\r\natmosphere in which all imagination of murderers moves and hides. It was\r\nat night, it was in a wild place, with the horror of a great height\r\nabout it; the corpse was stripped, the man was nameless. He was a\r\nsailor, walking from London to Portsmouth on September 23rd, 1786, to\r\nlook for a job. He had money in his pocket; at Esher he fell in with\r\nthree men, also on the road to Portsmouth, but without money; he paid\r\nfor food and drink and lodging for them, and he was last seen alive with\r\nthem at the Red Lion near Thursley. Perhaps the men were followed--one\r\naccount says they were watched--perhaps the finding of the body was by\r\nchance. Two cottagers, coming after them over the highest stretch of the\r\nhill, saw below them, white in the dim light, on the slope of the Punch\r\nBowl round which the road runs, the dead body as they thought of a\r\nsheep. One climbed down and saw what it was. Pursuers rushed down the\r\nroad at Sheet, near Petersfield, the three were caught, trying to sell\r\nthe dead man's clothes. They were tried at Kingston, and hanged in\r\nchains on the highest point of Hindhead; and there their bodies swung in\r\nthe wind over every coach that drove from London to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe old Portsmouth road ran over the summit of the hill. The new road,\r\ncut in 1826, winds lower down, and on the lower road the stone stands to\r\ncommemorate the crime. It was moved by the Ordnance Survey from the\r\nhigher ground, heedless of the warning engraved on it. On one side runs\r\nthe inscription:--\r\n\r\n                       ERECTED\r\n\r\n        In Detestation of a barbarous Murder\r\n        Committed here on an unknown Sailor,\r\n              On Sep^r. 24^th, 1786,\r\n    By Edw^d. Lonegan, Michael Casey, and Ja^s. Marshall,\r\n          Who were all taken the same day,\r\n          And hung in Chains near this place.\r\n\r\nThe back of the stone informs us that it was erected by order and at the\r\ncost of James Stillwell, of Cosford, 1786, and that he lays a curse on\r\n\"the man who injureth or removeth this stone.\" However, that had no\r\neffect on the Ordnance Surveyors.\r\n\r\nThe gibbet stood for years. Gilbert White writes to Thomas Barker from\r\nSelborne on New Year's Day, 1791:--\r\n\r\n    The thunder storm on Dec. 23 in the morning before day was very\r\n    aweful: but, I thank God, it did not do us the least harm. Two\r\n    millers, in a wind-mill on the Sussex downs near Good-wood, were\r\n    struck dead by lightning that morning; and part of the gibbet on\r\n    Hind-head, on which two murderers were suspended, was beaten down.\r\n\r\nLocal art has depicted the scene; four original oil-paintings grace the\r\nwalls of the Huts Hotel. Than the drawing of the stage-coach in full\r\ngallop up to the gibbet in the dead of night, nothing could be well more\r\nfrightful.\r\n\r\nLouis Jennings's description, in _Field Paths and Green Lanes_, of the\r\nPortsmouth road as he saw it in 1876, is worth reading at Hindhead on a\r\nsummer day:--\r\n\r\n    It is with surprise that in this lonely waste one sees, between the\r\n    Devil's Punch Bowl and the top of the hill, a fine, broad, and\r\n    well-kept road; nor is that surprise diminished when you come upon\r\n    it, and find that it is as hard and smooth as any road in a private\r\n    park can possibly be. There are very few marks of wheels to be found\r\n    upon it, but abundant traces of sheep. This is the main Portsmouth\r\n    road, and to any one who knows what the roads are in country\r\n    places, and even in large towns, throughout the United States, this\r\n    splendid thoroughfare must seem one of the greatest curiosities in\r\n    England; for the traffic of London Bridge might be driven along it,\r\n    and even in this steep and wild country it is kept in the most\r\n    perfect order. I declare that I stood looking at that road in\r\n    amazement for pretty nearly quarter of an hour, and I am inclined to\r\n    think that if I had stayed there till now I should not have seen\r\n    anybody or anything coming along it in either direction. Will the\r\n    tide of English summer travel ever again turn towards England\r\n    itself?\r\n\r\nThe tide turns every Saturday and Sunday. But besides the tide, for\r\nwhich policemen set traps along the level road, Hindhead maintains a\r\ncolony of its own. The western side of the hill and Grayshott on the\r\nHampshire slope are almost a town. Grayshott lies actually in Hampshire,\r\nbut geographically it belongs to Hindhead; so do Waggoner's Wells, a\r\nstring of ponds rather like the Shottermill trout hatchery, but set much\r\nmore prettily among trees.\r\n\r\nOf Hindhead it is as true as of other places with magnificent views,\r\nthat you must live on the spot to be sure of getting them. It is only\r\nthe greatest good luck that allows a casual visitor full measure of the\r\nsplendour of clear air all round him, north, south, east, and west. Even\r\nif it is clear to the south it may well be misty to the north, and, of\r\ncourse, the angle of the sunlight makes all the difference to the\r\nsharpness with which this or that detail of scenery stands out from its\r\nsurroundings. In one respect the view from the highest point of Hindhead\r\nis never perfect. To the south-east, on a neighbouring slope, the pine\r\ntrees that crest the ridge block out the downs over Brighton and\r\nNewhaven. It is a pity, for only from the tower on Leith Hill, not on\r\nLeith Hill itself, is there another view in the south-east of England\r\nwith so wonderful an expanse of country seen clear away to the horizon.\r\nSt. George's Hill is blocked with trees, so is St. Anne's; Leith Hill is\r\nalmost clear, but from Hindhead, until those unlucky pines grew up, you\r\ncould see pretty nearly thirty miles on any side. Not that the Devil's\r\nDyke and the downs beyond cannot any longer be seen from Hindhead; you\r\ncan get a fine view of them a mile away to the north, from the old\r\nPortsmouth road, on the other side of the new road, but from that point\r\nthe view is not nearly so fine on the other sides. The hill is not so\r\nhigh. On Gibbet Hill you are 895 feet above sea level according to the\r\nordnance map; if you have no map, you can consult a brass disc which has\r\nbeen erected on the plateau, which gives you also other interesting\r\ninformation. All the distances to the neighbouring towns are marked, for\r\ninstance, with the direction in which they lie as the crow flies--an\r\nadmirable idea, due to the generosity of Mr. T.W. Erle of Bramshott\r\nGrange, brother of the Sir William Erle who put up the granite cross\r\nwhich stands close by. It will be safer, in future, perhaps, to trust to\r\nthe ordnance map rather than the disc for the exact figures, for some of\r\nthem have already been nearly rubbed out, and Cockney names have been\r\nscratched on the brass. There they remain, the only gibbet on Gibbet\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nProse-writers have had much to say about Hindhead, among them the late\r\nGrant Allen, who pleased a not very exacting public with the not always\r\naccurate natural history of \"Moorland Idylls,\" and shocked it with\r\nHill-top novels. But I think no poet has written of the hill, unless it\r\nis Charles Kingsley, who surely had climbed Hindhead and looked out on\r\nthe view from its bracken and heather when he wrote _Airly Beacon_. It\r\nwas one of the first poems he made after coming to Eversley, and it\r\nbreathes the scent of June fern in the air and sun:--\r\n\r\n    Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;\r\n      Oh, the pleasant sight to see\r\n    Shires and towns from Airly Beacon,\r\n      While my love climbed up to me!\r\n\r\n    Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;\r\n      Oh, the happy hours we lay\r\n    Deep in fern on Airly Beacon,\r\n      Courting through the summer's day!\r\n\r\n    Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;\r\n      Oh, the weary haunt for me,\r\n    All alone on Airly Beacon,\r\n      With his baby on my knee!\r\n\r\nOf other writers, Mr. Baring-Gould has come nearest to catching the\r\nspirit of the moorlands and the breeze that sometimes drifts up over\r\nHindhead from the great glen which local myth has named the Devil's\r\nPunch Bowl. The _Broom Squire_ is strangely unsatisfactory as a novel,\r\nor I find it so, with its entire needlessness and inconsequence of plot.\r\nBut it has something in it of the heather and the wind, of the sand of\r\nThursley and the steam of the Punch Bowl on a wet day; and you may still\r\nmeet broom squires if you like to wander down into the deep of the glen.\r\nThe best broom squire is, I think, Kingsley's, in _My Winter Garden_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The clod of these parts is the descendant of many generations of\r\n    broom squires and deer stealers; the instinct of sport is strong\r\n    within him still, though no more of the Queen's deer are to be shot\r\n    in the winter turnip fields, or worse, caught by an apple-baited\r\n    hook hung from an orchard bough. He now limits his aspirations to\r\n    hares and pheasants, and too probably once in his life 'hits the\r\n    keeper into the river,' and reconsiders himself for a while over a\r\n    crank in Winchester gaol. Well, he has his faults, and I have mine.\r\n    But he is a thoroughly good fellow nevertheless. Civil, contented,\r\n    industrious, and often very handsome; a far shrewder fellow\r\n    too--owing to his dash of wild forest blood from gipsy, highwayman,\r\n    and what not--than his bullet-headed and flaxen-polled cousin, the\r\n    pure South Saxon of the chalk downs. Dark-haired he is, ruddy, and\r\n    tall of bone; swaggering in his youth: but when he grows old a\r\n    thorough gentleman, reserved, stately, and courteous as a\r\n    prince....\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Devil's Punch Bowl, from Gibbet Hill._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps broom squires belong more properly to Thursley and the moors.\r\nThey are a disappearing race, and I have met few of them. But their\r\ncottages, some of then mantled with ivy, some of them broken and\r\ntumbling, some empty altogether, stand along the slopes of Highcombe\r\nBottom, which is the glen of the Punch Bowl, and dot themselves here and\r\nthere by the sandy lanes to the north. Compared with the loneliness of\r\nsome of these lanes, the wildest tract of Hindhead is a garden. The\r\nflowerless, silent shade of a lane by Highcombe Bottom in August, when\r\nno birds are singing, is the most solitary thing in the countryside.\r\nBut on Hindhead there is always wild life moving. I have seen strange\r\nvisitors there; as strange as any were a brood of pheasants, almost on\r\nthe highest ridge. Or perhaps even odder hill-dwellers are the tadpoles\r\nwhich swarm in the summer in the little pools on the highest ridge\r\nitself. What should frogs be doing on Hindhead? Perhaps they are toads.\r\nBut the happiest and the most graceful of all living things on Hindhead\r\nare the swifts. To me, indeed, they are a part of the place; they belong\r\nto that hot clear air over the height of the downs, to the sense of\r\nimmense distance of green fields spread south to Chanctonbury Ring and\r\nnorth to Nettlebed by Henley. I never think of Hindhead without two\r\nsights of summer; of children wandering over the hillside with their\r\nlips stained with bilberries; and the swifts sailing in royal circles\r\nhigh in the blue or screaming in pursuing companies, close and low over\r\nthe roadway down the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Post Office, Churt._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Red Lion, Thursley._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHURSLEY AND THE MOORS\r\n\r\n    Painters among heather.--The Devil's Jumps.--The Devil\r\n    redivivus.--Cobbett at Thursley.--A superb belfry.--The Sailor's\r\n    Grave.--Pig-iron and hammers.--The natterjack at eve.--A plank for\r\n    bellringers.--Witley fifty years hence.--Mehetabel in the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThursley lies nearly three miles north of Hindhead on the edge of the\r\nheather, and brings artists all the summer to paint its timbered\r\ncottages and glowing hills. Mrs. Allingham sketched as charmingly on\r\nThursley common as by Haslemere; Birket Foster found a background of\r\npurple for his cottage gardens. Mrs. Allingham's sketch of Hindhead from\r\nWitley common, which runs up to Thursley from the north-east, is all the\r\nwild of this part of Surrey on a few inches of paper.\r\n\r\nThursley is Thor's ley or field, and has memories of the Danes. They\r\nleft other names near: Tuesley, or Tuesco's field, lies towards\r\nGodalming, and Thunder Hill, near Elstead, is Thor's or Thunor's. Thor\r\nlives in local legends. Three strange conical hills, lying close\r\ntogether two miles or so west of Thursley, have been known since his day\r\nas the Devil's Jumps. Tradition draws a frightful picture of the Devil,\r\nhorns and tail and all, jumping from hill to hill to amuse himself,\r\nuntil one day Thor caught him at it and knocked him over with an\r\nenormous stone. You can see the stone on the Devil's Jumps to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Interior of Thursley Church._]\r\n\r\nThe Devil jumped up again when I was last looking at the Jumps. I had\r\nclimbed to the top of Kettlebury Hill, a mile away, and was looking out\r\nover those strange little lumps of rock and crimson heather, which\r\npuzzled Cobbett to the end of his days, when suddenly at my feet there\r\nstarted up a rabbit as black as a cinder, leapt wildly about the\r\nheather, and disappeared. There could have been very little doubt what\r\nthat meant long after Thor's time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Thursley._]\r\n\r\nCobbett, riding in from Hampshire or Sussex, used to make Thursley his\r\nfirst stopping-place. But one thing he would not do, and that was to\r\ncome into Thursley over Hindhead. He detested turnpike roads, and he\r\ndetested Hindhead. He liked to ride through woods, or along lanes with\r\ntrees meeting overhead. When he rides from Chiddingford to Thursley, he\r\nwrites that \"the great thing was to see the centre of these woods, to\r\nsee the stems of the trees as well as the tops of them.\" Otherwise, the\r\npleasure in riding was to pass fine turnip-fields, or bean-fields;\r\nanything rather than waste land. The heather on the hills might glow to\r\ncrimson, and the bracken fade from emerald to bronze, without touching a\r\nchord in that sturdy farmer's heart. Hindhead, you read, \"is certainly\r\nthe most villainous spot that God ever made,\" and Cobbett will have\r\nnothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe last fifty years have altered and enlarged Thursley church, but it\r\nstill retains the distinction, unique in Surrey, of its timber tower and\r\nsteeple rising from the centre of the nave. Other churches in the\r\ncounty--Dunsfold and Alfold in the neighbourhood--carry their\r\nbell-turrets on ingenious constructions of timber, but there is no such\r\ncollection in any other Surrey church of such superb beams as are to be\r\nseen at Thursley. The effect of these dark and majestic pillars of oak,\r\nsome of them thirty inches square, with their great crossbeams, and\r\ntheir arches springing from the pillars across the nave, is one of\r\nastonishing splendour and power. Outside, the shingled turret tells the\r\ntime with, instead of a clock, a fine old sundial.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the church stands a thing of terror. The full story of\r\nthe murder of the \"unknown sailor\" belongs to Hindhead; but Thursley has\r\nhis grave. It lies apart, in the centre of a stretch of green grass;\r\nabove it, a stone too tall for quietness; no other grave shares that\r\nlonely lawn. Here is the queer, mis-spelt epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    When pitying Eyes to see my Grave shall come,\r\n    And with a generous Tear bedew my Tomb;\r\n    Here shall they read my melancholy Fate,\r\n    With Murder and Barbarity complete.\r\n    In perfect Health, and in the Flower of Age,\r\n    I fell a Victim to three Ruffians Rage;\r\n    On bended Knees I mercy strove t' obtain,\r\n    Their Thirst of Blood made all Entreaties vain.\r\n    No dear Relation, or still dearer Friend,\r\n    Weeps my hard Lot, or miserable End;\r\n    Yet o'er my sad Remains, (my Name unknown,)\r\n    A generous Public have inscrib'd this Stone.\r\n\r\nAbove the epitaph a rough carving shows the sailor kneeling to his\r\nmurderers. Mr. Baring-Gould, in the _Broom Squire_ makes Iver Verstage,\r\nthe artist, laugh at the crudely drawn figures. But the horror of this\r\ngrave, from which all the other quieter graves are gathered apart, has\r\nvery little laughter in it.\r\n\r\nThursley Common once rang with the picks and hammers of an iron mine; it\r\nwas one of the centres of a great industry of the Weald. The surface of\r\nthe common is scarred with the pits from which the ironstone was dug;\r\nthe hammer ponds lie in a string along a tiny tributary of the Wey. John\r\nRay, in his _Collection of English Words not generally Used_, published\r\nin 1672, and printed in the _Sussex Archaeological Collections_, gives an\r\naccount of the methods of the old iron smelters. A stream, or a pond\r\nwith a stream running through it, would be dammed, and the fall of water\r\nat the lower end would then work two pairs of bellows for the blast for\r\nthe furnace and a wheel which raised and let fall a hammer. The fuel\r\nused was charcoal. Before the ironstone was put into the furnace it was\r\n\"mollified\" or broken up into small pieces by being burnt between layers\r\nof charcoal. Then it was put into the furnace, and when melted drawn off\r\nin long lumps, called pigs or sows. Then the sows were taken to the\r\nforge or hammer, and beaten into square \"blooms,\" two feet long; then\r\nthe blooms were beaten into \"anconies,\" three feet long; then the\r\n\"anconies\" had their ends nicely shaped, and the iron was ready for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nA very extensive \"collection of English words not generally used\" is\r\ncontained in an inventory of tools supplied to William Yalden, when he\r\ntook over the Thursley ironworks. Perhaps an ironmaster of to-day might\r\nrecognise some of those I have chosen:--\r\n\r\n    Twoe fargons. A beame way anckrues. One turnsowe. One hurdgier. One\r\n    twewer trole; one twewer hook. Two hursts and brights to them. 2\r\n    eyron rackes. A hamer and ane bill and helfe and armes redy placed.\r\n    Twoe boyghts about the Chafery. One quas to stopp the fyer. A neew\r\n    locke.\r\n\r\nMr. Baring-Gould has described one of the natives of Thursley Common in\r\nthe _Broom Squire_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The natterjack, so rare elsewhere, differing from a toad in that\r\n    it has a yellow band down its back, has here a paradise. It may be\r\n    seen at eve perched on a stalk of willow herb or running--it does\r\n    not hop--round the sundew, clearing the glutinous stamens of the\r\n    flies that have been caught by them, and calling in a tone like the\r\n    warning note of the nightingale.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Elstead._]\r\n\r\nI looked for the natterjack at eve, but did not find him. At Farnham, I\r\nam told, he is called a jar-bob. Thursley children like to catch a\r\nnatterjack to sell.\r\n\r\nElstead is three miles away, on the northern edge of the belt of\r\nheather; a happy little village standing round a green, with a mill, a\r\nbridge, and a church with a wonderful ladder up to the belfry. This is\r\nactually a single vast plank of oak, black and immoveable, sloped up\r\nfrom a crossbeam and notched for steps. There are many magnificent beams\r\nin Surrey churches, but this is the finest ladder of all of them. It\r\ndoes not tempt ascent in days of more elaborate staircases; but it would\r\nnot break under the heaviest set of bellringers that ever rung a change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Witley._]\r\n\r\nTo the east is Milford, a good half mile from its station, and nothing\r\nmuch besides. There is a good natural centre to the village, with four\r\ncross roads and an inn, but no doubt Milford's future is to belong to\r\nGodalming. A few half-timbered and weather-tiled cottages, which have\r\nserved as models for newer neighbours, some pollarded elms, a broad\r\nsmooth road and dusty jasmine--Milford is the first village on the\r\nhighway running south from Godalming, and on a summer Saturday is less a\r\nvillage than a road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The White Hart, Witley._]\r\n\r\nOne of the four roads which branch off from Milford to the south runs to\r\nWitley. Witley will look more tranquil and more seasoned fifty years\r\nhence. To come into the village in the gathering dusk of a summer\r\nevening, as I saw it first, is an enchantment; nothing could throw a\r\nquieter spell than the brick and timber and tar and whitewash of the\r\ncottages, the flowers climbing up the old inn, and the familiar noises\r\nof a neighbouring game of cricket finishing in half darkness. But only\r\npart of Witley will stand the full glare of sunlight. The new cottages\r\nare finely designed, but they are too black-and-white and painty to\r\ngroup easily with the older, mossier buildings and the White Hart Inn,\r\nwith its nobly ugly sign.\r\n\r\nThe church, bowered in ivy and roses, has some quaint inscriptions. One\r\ncommemorates a forgotten office:--\r\n\r\n    \"Off yo^r charite pray for the soull^e of Thomas Jonys and his wyfe\r\n    Jane, which Thomas was one of the Sewers of the Chamber to oure\r\n    Soverayne lorde Kynge Henry VIII.\"\r\n\r\nA Sewer of the Chamber waited at the table and brought water for the\r\nhands of the guests--an office which suggests an obvious rhyme for poets\r\nwriting of water-jugs. Another epitaph is a shining example of the\r\nproper manner of attributing to the dead an almost crushing superfluity\r\nof virtues. Sara Holney, first in Latin, and then in English, thus is\r\nlamented and extolled:--\r\n\r\n    \"A better woman than here sleeps, there's none,\r\n    Sara, Rebecca, Rahel, three in one:\r\n    Religious, pious, thrifty, wise, fayre, and chast:\r\n    Soe many goods in one, who finds in hast?\"\r\n\r\nOne more name attracts. Mehetabel, daughter of John Leech of Lea, died\r\nin 1816. She was doubtless a friend of Cobbett, who often rode by Lea,\r\nand greatly admired her father's trees. The first Mehetabel was the wife\r\nof the king of Edom, and the last, possibly, is the heroine of the\r\n_Broom Squire_.\r\n\r\nWitley has perhaps been a little overshadowed by the tragedy of a late\r\nowner of Lea Park. I have heard descriptions of the new features of Lea\r\nPark, the lakes and fountains and a billiard-room, I believe, under\r\nwater, but I have not seen them.\r\n\r\nBefore Hindhead drew authors and artists up the hill, Witley had its own\r\nsettlement of workers living deep in Surrey country. George Eliot was at\r\nWitley Heights; J.C. Hook, who could not bear to be watched while he was\r\npainting, sketched Witley gorse and heather; Birket Foster long lived\r\namong the Witley pines; and Mrs. Allingham, who was at Sandhills, a\r\nhouse near by, has painted few more interesting pictures than her\r\n_Lessons_, _Pat-a-cake_, and _The Children's Tea_. At Witley she\r\npainted most of her studies of children indoors, in the nursery and the\r\nschoolroom; after she left Witley, she liked to set her cottage girls\r\nand boys among bluebells and apple-blossom out of doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A corner in the White Hart, Witley, known as George\r\nEliot's corner._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE FOLD COUNTRY\r\n\r\n    The Wild Garden of Surrey.--Birds and their\r\n    valentines.--Nightingales at Dunsfold.--Alfold Stocks.--Three yews\r\n    in a line.--The King's Evil.--Alfold industries.--A dry\r\n    canal.--Chiddingfold.--Red brick and Madonna lilies.--The\r\n    Enticknaps.--Hungry scholars.--The Crown Inn.--On Highdown Ball.--A\r\n    green ride in the woods.--The Chiddingfold Foxhounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Fold Country\" is the wild garden of the Surrey weald, and the month\r\nto walk in it is May. Alfold, Ifold, Durfold, Dunsfold, Chiddingfold,\r\nand other \"folds\" lie among oakwoods and ploughlands that once were\r\noakwoods; the railway runs nowhere nearer than seven miles from the\r\nheart of the woods, and in the woods the timbered cottages stand apart,\r\nold and tranquil. To me, the associations of the \"Fold Country\" centre\r\nround the memory of a First of May hotter and more glorious with flowers\r\nthan any I can remember. I had started to walk from Baynards Station\r\nwest among the woods, with the recollection of four days of north-east\r\nwinds and heavy snow that had brought April to a close. The change was\r\nincredible. There, in the roads that ran through the oakwoods and hazel\r\ncopses, it was the heat of summer. The birds had drawn new valentines. A\r\ncock chaffinch, gayest of suitors, danced round his demure hen in the\r\nroadway, careless of any pedestrian in that deep country; wrens crept\r\nlike mice among the stubs of the hedge; the grass by the roadside and\r\nthe ditch was lighted with primroses. A narrow copse of cut hazel,\r\nbordering the road on the Sussex boundary, was a carpet of primroses,\r\nanemones, milkmaids, and dog violets; spires of purple orchids stood\r\nabove shining celandines; there could have been nothing more brilliant\r\nin a garden. On the hedge-bank a hen pheasant rustled through the\r\nundergrowth, caught sight of me, crept to a rabbit-scratch and crouched\r\non the brown earth within a yard of my hand; for the birds are tamer in\r\nthe Fold Country than beyond it. Above other hedge-banks, in other\r\ncopses, the cuckoos called all that morning, from Sussex to Surrey, over\r\nthe border road.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Fold Country farmhouses by that road, framed in that sunny\r\nsetting, belong to the memories of a Surrey May. One is a timbered house\r\ntwenty yards in Sussex, with white curtains and flower-pots behind its\r\ndiamond-paned lattices, and clumps of primroses growing about stone\r\ncauseways up to the very door. The other is Pallinghurst farm, a mile\r\nfurther on the road, whose long, lichened roofs shelter red-tiled walls\r\nand masses of ivy round a white doorway; the garden is a cluster of\r\ngnarled apple-trees, and over it and about the tall farm chimneys, when\r\nI saw it that morning, flew the first swallows of the year. But it was\r\nnot the swallows that made summer that May-day. Beyond Alfold, on the\r\nroad that runs out of Sidney Wood up to Dunsfold Common, there are\r\ncoppices of thick undergrowth, set about orchards of grey-lichened\r\nfruit-trees and stretches of low cut hazel sheeted with primroses. There\r\nI heard the first nightingale of the year, a single jet of song as the\r\nbrown tail flickered in the covert; a hundred yards further down the\r\nroad there were three singing together; Dunsfold Common came in a burst\r\nof yellow gorse, and the song of a nightingale thrilled up from the\r\ngorse; another bird, beyond Dunsfold, sang high in the hedgerow in full\r\nsunlight. That is a Dunsfold lane, for me; a wild plum-tree branching\r\nout of the hedge dressed with the whitest of delicate blossom, and in\r\nthe white blossom, with the hot blue of a May sky beyond and between, a\r\nnightingale's throat throbbing with singing.\r\n\r\nAlfold almost touches the Sussex boundary, and is perhaps the most\r\nout-of-the-way little village in Surrey. I find Mr. Ralph Nevill,\r\nwriting in 1889, lamenting that it was once charmingly rural, but that\r\n\"the breath of the pestilence has passed over and vulgarised it.\" There\r\nare new houses in it, and new generally means hideous; but the\r\npestilence has left some old work worth looking at. At the eastern end\r\nof the village stands Alfold House, a sixteenth-century timbered\r\nbuilding; at the western end is the church, grey with its shingled\r\nspire, built like Thursley and Elstead on massive oak beams. A broad\r\nstone causeway leads to the door; in May, the springing grass shines\r\nwith daffodils.\r\n\r\nAlfold, like Shalford, Abinger and Newdigate, still has its village\r\nstocks. They stand at the churchyard gate, better worth sitting in, so\r\nfar as appearance goes, than the other three. Alfold, too, has a great\r\nold yew-tree, one of a row of three in the Fold churchyards. Has it ever\r\nbeen noticed that the Alfold, Dunsfold, and Hambledon yews stand almost\r\nin a mathematically straight line? From Alfold to Hambledon is five\r\nmiles as the crow flies, and Dunsfold is almost exactly half way between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nThree Alfold villagers, perhaps, made the journey to London, or to some\r\nhalting-place in the royal progress, to seek the grace of King James II.\r\nThe parish register-book contains the entry of their names on the\r\ntitle-page:--\r\n\r\n    2 May   }      {  I gave certificates to Jane Puttock, Henry\r\n    4 --    } 1687 {  Manfield, Elizabeth Saker, to be touched\r\n    19 July }      {  for the [King's] Evil.\r\n\r\nWhether Jane Puttock, Henry Manfield and Elizabeth Saker were cured of\r\nthe scrofula by the highly medicinal contact of the royal hands does not\r\nappear; but in 1710 another patient, James Napper, was certified to be\r\n\"a legal inhabitant of our parish of Alfold in the county of Surrey\r\naforesaid and is supposed to have the disease commonly called the Evil.\"\r\nPerhaps not one of the four had much more than the country bumpkin's\r\nnatural desire to see the King and be able to talk about it afterwards;\r\nperhaps they coveted the little gold tokens which royal physicking hung\r\nround the sufferer's neck. Not all those who were touched for the Evil\r\nwere languishing with a fell disease. Charles II operated on nearly a\r\nhundred thousand of his lieges, with instant success when there was\r\nnothing the matter with them. But Anne, the divines held, did not\r\nsucceed directly to the throne, and therefore did not succeed to the\r\nmiraculous powers of the Jameses and Charleses. It was very little good\r\nfor James Napper to go to London, for, practically speaking, the queen\r\ncould cure nobody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Surrey Byway._]\r\n\r\nAlfold, which in Aubrey's day was Awfold--variant spellings of \"old\r\nfold\"--was not always purely rustic and agricultural. There is a slab of\r\nSussex marble in the churchyard which is declared to cover the remains\r\nof the last of the Surrey glass manufacturers--the \"French glass men\"\r\nwho are supposed to have carried on an illicit factory in the depths of\r\nSidney Wood. Another Alfold industry was smuggling, or assistant-smuggling.\r\n\"The gentlemen\" ran their tobacco and brandy by way of some of the Alfold\r\nfarmhouses; the farmer left out \"bread and beef\" for the gentlemen, and the\r\ngentlemen left kegs behind for the farmer.\r\n\r\nSidney Wood lies between Alfold and Dunsfold, and grows hazel and oak\r\nfor various industries, besides acres of the purest and palest\r\nprimroses. Through it runs a curious trackway, marked \"disused\" on the\r\nOrdnance maps. It is a section of the Wey and Arun Junction Canal, now a\r\ndry bed studded with hazel stubs and clumps of flowers. Dunsfold Common\r\njoins the wood, and beyond it, round a wide green, stand the Dunsfold\r\ncottages, seventeenth century mixed with twentieth. In the churchyard,\r\nwhen I was there in May, I once saw a curious sight. From inside the\r\nchurch the great yew seemed to be alive with bees; the noise was of\r\ntwenty swarms. I went out to find that they were not bees, but flies.\r\nThe western wall of the tower was black with them; so were the\r\ngravestones and the gravel. There must have been millions, hatched, no\r\ndoubt, in the heat of the wooden belfry.\r\n\r\nDunsfold is too far from the railway to be crowded, but it is building\r\nbusily. The twentieth century is not as frightened of deep country as\r\nManning and Bray, who remark that \"the common before coming to the\r\nchurch is wide, and over it a road has been thrown up in a regular way,\r\nand is tolerable, and a part near to Hascombe Hill has been done in the\r\nsame manner, but between them is a dreadful gulph.\" Dunsfold would\r\nprobably be thankful if to-day the \"gulph\" were wider.\r\n\r\nFrom Dunsfold one may push on through Hascombe to rejoin the railway at\r\nMilford or Godalming, or one may turn west to Chiddingfold. But Hascombe\r\nis better seen from Godalming, and the natural way is to group\r\nChiddingfold with the other \"fold\" villages.\r\n\r\nOf the three, Alfold has hardly begun to grow, Dunsfold straggles, and\r\nChiddingfold sits compact about its sunny green. Red-roofed, tranquil,\r\nand uneven the little cottages stand behind their glowing flower\r\ngardens. Here a long low brick wall edges the road, mellow and lichened;\r\nhere a double-gabled, weather-tiled building stands next to a patch of\r\nold brick painted the newest possible yellow. Somehow the effect is not\r\nhideous, and fits with the haphazard, sunlit tiles and whitewash.\r\nChiddingfold is at its best and sleepiest in high summer--a village of\r\nweatherworn red brick and Madonna lilies.\r\n\r\nIn the church, which stands among trees, with an air of large solidity a\r\nlittle graver than the small, shingle-spired churches of the other two\r\nvillages, are tablets to the memory of a number of Enticknaps, described\r\nsturdily as \"yeomen,\" of Upper Dunce, Pockford, and Gorbage Green, which\r\nappears on the maps in the plainer form of Garbage Green. Enticknap is a\r\ngood Surrey name to-day, and there were Enticknaps in Chiddingfold at\r\nthe Conquest. The parish registers are full of Enticknaps; in one\r\ncentury there were fifty burials in the family in Chiddingfold\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\nIt was by Chiddingfold churchyard that Cobbett made a discovery in the\r\npeerage. He was riding through the village with his son Richard on a\r\nfine frosty November morning, and saw a carriage and pair conveying an\r\nold gentleman and some ladies to the churchyard steps. \"Upon inquiry we\r\nfound that this was Lord Winterton, whose name, they told us, was\r\nTurnour. I thought I had heard of all the Lords, first or last; but, if\r\never I had heard of this one before, I had forgotten him.\" A little\r\nfurther on, he came across some less wealthy churchgoers, a school of\r\npoor boys in uniform:--\r\n\r\n    \"There were about twenty of them, without one single tinge of red in\r\n    their whole twenty faces. In short, I never saw more deplorable\r\n    objects since I was born. And can it be of any use to expend money\r\n    in this sort of way upon poor creatures that have not half a\r\n    bellyful of food? We had not breakfasted when we passed them. We\r\n    felt, at that moment, what hunger was. We had some bits of bread and\r\n    meat in our pockets, however; and these, which were merely intended\r\n    as stay-stomachs, amounted, I dare say, to the allowance of any half\r\n    dozen of these poor boys for the day. I could, with all my heart,\r\n    have pulled the victuals out of my pocket and given it to them: but\r\n    I did not like to do that which would have interrupted the march,\r\n    and might have been construed into a sort of insult. To quiet my\r\n    conscience, however, I gave a poor man that I met soon afterwards\r\n    sixpence, under pretence of rewarding him for telling me the way to\r\n    Thursley, which I knew as well as he, and which I had determined, in\r\n    my own mind, not to follow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Crown Inn, Chiddingfold._]\r\n\r\nChiddingfold's old inn is the Crown, which claims to have been standing\r\nfor more than five centuries. According to a copy of a deed dated March\r\n22, 1383, which hangs in the coffee-room, Peter Pokeford, of the parish\r\nof Chudyngfold, gave and granted to Richard Gofayre, \"the said\r\ntenement, namely, the Hall and the Chamber with a solar, and also the\r\nkitchen with a small house with their appurtenances for the term of\r\nfifty years for four shillings of yearly rent payable to the said\r\nPeter.\" The inn is pleasant and solid, and dark with enormous wooden\r\nbeams. Above a fine old open hearth hang three engaging pictures--or\r\nused to hang--of actresses of days gone by. Madame Vestris, in a feather\r\nhat and a red cloak, plays Don Giovanni; Miss Paton, spangled, trousered\r\nand red-slippered, would appeal to any Turk as Mandane; Belvidera, in a\r\nsober grey gown, is an actress who knew Surrey well, Fanny Kemble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rock Hill, Hambledon._]\r\n\r\nTo the Fold Country belong two other villages, Hascombe, two miles north\r\nof Dunsfold, and Hambledon, a little more than two miles west of\r\nHascombe. The Hascombe yews, which make an arched gateway to the\r\nchurchyard, will some day be famous; the church lacks something of the\r\nquiet of plainer, whiter walls. Half-a-mile south of the church,\r\nHascombe Hill once lit a beacon, and looks out over many miles of the\r\nFold Country. At the White Horse in the village I was told of a great\r\nold beech-tree standing on the hill, and learned that if you went up the\r\nhill it was impossible to miss it; however, I followed all the\r\ndirections and achieved the impossible. Once Hascombe was the home of a\r\ndivine whom the biographers briefly describe as \"controversialist.\" He\r\nwas Doctor Conyers Middleton, the author of a famous _Life of Cicero_,\r\nfor which he stole the materials from a Scottish professor's work, _De\r\nTribus Luminibus Romanorum_, and for some time was not found out. His\r\ncontroversies were chiefly with Bentley, who perhaps was as arrogant as\r\nMiddleton was greedy.\r\n\r\nHascombe Hill is the eastern of three hills which stand in a triangle\r\nround the north of the Fold Country. Highdown Ball is the centre of the\r\nthree, fifty feet lower than Hascombe Hill, which is 644 feet; but\r\nHighdown Ball somehow seems the higher of the two. A strange little\r\nrhyme, or riddle, belongs to the hill:--\r\n\r\n    \"On Hydon's top there is a cup,\r\n    And in that cup there is a drop:\r\n    Take up the cup and drink the drop,\r\n    And place the cup on Hydon's top.\"\r\n\r\nThe third hill is Hambledon's. The village is dotted over the hill and\r\nat its foot; the church is perched on the very top, and it is worth\r\nclimbing the hill to look at the pair of yew trees in the churchyard.\r\nOne of them cannot be much smaller than the Crowhurst yew itself. Like\r\nthat monarch of trees, it is hollow; unlike it, it has not yet been\r\ndamaged by man in order to protect it from the weather.\r\n\r\nHambledon is best approached from Chiddingfold through Hambledon Hurst,\r\na stretch of cool woodland. A tiny path leaves the main road over a\r\nstrip of grass and brambles, dives into an oakwood and emerges at the\r\nend of a long straight open ride of grass, edged and shaded by oak\r\ntrees, green, smooth and silent. Into such open glades dark fallow deer\r\nshould come, and roedeer dancing out from the shadows to listen and\r\nsnuff. If bearded men with jewelled feathers and crimson cloaks rode\r\nacross the patches of sunlight, it would be nothing strange in that deep\r\nwood. The illusion of virgin solitude is perfect. Yet the green ride was\r\nonce the main road south from Godalming through Hambledon to Chichester.\r\n\r\nI ought not to leave the Fold Country without mentioning the\r\nChiddingfold foxhounds, a pack which hunts the country south of\r\nGuildford to the borders of Lord Leconfield's Hunt in Sussex. It is poor\r\nriding, for there is too much woodland, and on the heather there is\r\nhardly any jumping. \"The prettier the country the poorer the hunting,\"\r\nMr. Charles Richardson quotes in writing of the Chiddingfold foxhounds:\r\nperhaps one might add that in a poor country there can be some pretty\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Black Down, from Hambledon._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCRANLEIGH AND EWHURST\r\n\r\n    A coffee-pot yew--Vachery Pond--The osprey as a guest--Baynards and\r\n    its ghost--Ewhurst--A pet lamb--Children and a gipsy--Bilberries on\r\n    Pitch Hill--Lost in Hurst Wood--Farley Heath--Mr. Watson's\r\n    poem--Blackheath well named.\r\n\r\n\r\nCranleigh lies on the edge of the Fold country, neither in it nor of it.\r\nIn the Fold country the villages are set deep in woodlands and grass\r\nfields, and the railway runs too far away to bring the slate for the\r\nvillas. But the railway runs through Cranleigh and stops there, and so\r\ndoes the builder. The fields and woods are being \"developed.\" But in the\r\nheart of the village there is a touch of what is old and quiet. A\r\nstrange, towering figure of a clipped yew stands up in the middle of a\r\nsmall garden, whether most like a peacock on a pillar, or a colossal\r\ncoffee-pot, I cannot determine. A wheelwright's yard is near by--one of\r\nthe best of all sights of any country village. Farm carts and their\r\nwheels, and big spokes and shavings of white wood give as full a notion\r\nof solid, strong outdoor work as the forge and the rickyard, and no\r\nvillage is quite a country village without the three.\r\n\r\nTwo manors, Vachery and Knowle, have chapels in the church, which is\r\ncruciform; but the Vachery chapel is seated for ordinary churchgoers.\r\nThe Knowle chapel is separated off by a fine fifteenth-century screen.\r\nBut the chief beauty of Cranleigh Church is the great sense of breadth\r\nand light which you get from the size of the nave and the chancel arch.\r\nThe broad spaces and the massive Norman pillars set an air of strength\r\nand quiet in the place that belongs alone to noble churches.\r\n\r\nOf Vachery Manor one may hear little; of Vachery Pond every troutfisher\r\nknows something. The maps mark a superb sheet of water, nearly a mile\r\nlong, and, two or three times, travelling from Guildford or Horsham, I\r\nhave tried to catch a glimpse of the water from the railway, but in\r\nvain. When at last I stood on the edge of the water, the reason was\r\nclear enough; the pond is surrounded by banks covered with trees. A\r\nright of way runs from the road near Cranleigh round the south of the\r\npond to Baynards beyond, and the pond lies near the right of way, a\r\ngrass-edged road alive with rabbits. I saw the pond first on a July\r\nmorning; the drying leaves showed that earlier in the year the road to\r\nit ran between carpets of primroses. The water lay without a ripple in\r\nthe sun; at the far side, two crested grebes swam low, like submarines,\r\ndiving for fish to feed their young, who asked for food without\r\nweariness and without ceasing, and received it with excited splashings.\r\nUnder the bank danced a cotillon of tiny dragon-flies, needles of\r\nturquoise stuck suddenly on a reed, flitting aimlessly over the clear,\r\nshadowed water. Just in such sunlight, though later in the year, those\r\ntwo glorious guests visited Vachery Pond in September, 1904. A pair of\r\nospreys, on their journey south for the winter, made the water their\r\nhome for a few days, to the consternation of the wildfowl and the\r\ndelight of the other troutfishers. One of them, writing to the _Field_\r\nat the time, described the way in which the bird he saw fished the\r\nwater. It would sail up and down over the lake and then drop into the\r\nwater with a resounding crash, rising always with a trout in its talons.\r\nBut the visit did not last long. A keeper shot the male bird, and its\r\nmate--ospreys pair for life--went on to the south alone.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Vachery Pond is Baynards, one of the historic\r\nSurrey houses, and a fine relic of Tudor days. Baynards once was the\r\nhome of Margaret Roper, daughter of Sir Thomas More, and the story goes\r\nthat after her father's execution she brought his head to Baynards.\r\nPerhaps that started the Baynards' ghost. Legend plays with the aura of\r\nBaynards as of Loseley. Once a year the two ghosts meet: the Baynards\r\nghost dines at Loseley, and the Loseley ghost pays back the visit next\r\nyear at Baynards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _At Ewhurst._]\r\n\r\nNorth-east of Baynards an old Roman road runs from Rowhook on the Stane\r\nStreet in Sussex towards Farley Heath, where there was a Roman camp.\r\nThe Roman road, now hardly traceable, cuts the road from Cranleigh near\r\nEwhurst. Ewhurst lives comfortably fifty years behind Cranleigh, and is\r\nstill, happily, what the late Louis Jennings called it in _Field Paths\r\nand Green Lanes_, \"a one-horse place.\" When Mr. Jennings was at Ewhurst\r\neverybody was half-asleep. \"At the post-office a woman and a girl turned\r\nout in some consternation to look at me, thinking, perhaps, that I had a\r\nletter concealed about me, and was about to post it, and thus overwhelm\r\nthem with work.\" Such a village would be desirable anywhere. But\r\nEwhurst, although it can be sleepy in the sunshine, as everything in the\r\ncountry ought to be, has an eye for country business. At the door of the\r\npost-office, when I was there on a hot day in July, a long-tailed sheep,\r\nfat and woolly, cropped the grass. It was a pet lamb grown up,\r\napparently, and pleased to be patted. A cart drove up, and there was a\r\nconversation which might have come out of _Edgeworth's Parent's\r\nAssistant_ when Simple Susan's pet lamb was in the same evil case. From\r\nthe cart descended a butcher, who shook his head when questioned by the\r\nlamb's caretaker, or keeper, who looked after its owner's interests from\r\na neighbouring dwelling. Wasn't he worth three pounds? Not three pounds;\r\nno. Fifty-five shillings, perhaps, would be a fair price in a week's\r\ntime. A fair price in a week's time--it was impossible to listen to the\r\ncareful bargaining over the creature feeding in the sun. I went into the\r\nshop to buy something, and within a few minutes was asked, as an obvious\r\nadmirer of the lamb, whether I would like him for fifty shillings.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth should have stayed at Ewhurst, and have seen the best of\r\nan English village as I did that July afternoon. Opposite the church--a\r\nchurch which, with its stainless glass windows, its white walls, and its\r\ngreen carpet and curtains, gives you the feeling of entering a\r\ndrawing-room--are the village schools. Out of the schools as I watched\r\nthem the village children came tumbling. Half of them made for a passage\r\nby the churchyard, where a small boy, gipsy or pedlar's child, sat in\r\nthe shadow of the wall. He was dusty and hot, and by him lay a large\r\nbundle wrapped in a spotted blue handkerchief. One of the schoolchildren\r\nstopped after passing him, and whispered to another. Then four little\r\nboys went back and each dropped a penny or a halfpenny into the child's\r\nhand. Then they ran off through the churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance Maps mark a hill north of Ewhurst of which the country\r\nchildren have never heard. Coneyhurst Hill, the map assures you, is 844\r\nfeet high, only 50 feet less than Hindhead. People who like\r\nbell-heather, bilberries, and a magnificent view should climb it, but it\r\nis no use asking the children the way to Coneyhurst Hill. Pitch Hill\r\nthey know, and only Pitch Hill. Nor will they recognise bilberries or\r\nwhortleberries so called; \"hurts\" is the name. Another point on which\r\nthe traveller wandering in these wilds should assure himself is that he\r\nhas plenty of time, or has a compass with him, or can find his way by\r\nthe sun. The woods--Hurt Wood is the general name for miles--north and\r\nwest of Pitch Hill are the loneliest places. Here and there a forest\r\nfire has cleared openings in the trees, but where the pines have fallen\r\nor have been cut the bracken still grows breast high, and birches have\r\nseeded themselves into thick, thwarting plantations. The wood runs in\r\nridges, so that whichever way you want to go you cannot keep an\r\nobjective in sight. Missel thrushes clatter up from the open spaces;\r\njays bark in the birches, angry at an intrusion. Except for them the\r\nsilence, in a silent month like July or August, is profound.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Hurt Wood I wanted to walk from the windmill to Farley\r\nHeath, two and a-half miles as the crow flies, nearer five miles as I\r\nwalked it. The perplexing thing is the number of disused rides and paths\r\nin the wood. They cross each other perpetually at right angles, like\r\nlines on a chessboard, and if you are walking diagonally across them the\r\ntemptation is to a succession of knights' moves which end in wrong\r\nplaces. I followed one of these rides a long way, and the wood grew\r\nthicker and thicker; suddenly it ended, and I found myself in a\r\nclearing, with the loneliest little cottage in the corner, guarded by a\r\nhuge black retriever in an iron kennel; a woman was drawing water by the\r\ndoor. Where was I, could she tell me? Where did I want to go to? she\r\nasked in reply--probably the right answer.\r\n\r\nFarley Heath is one of the few well-defined stations of a Roman camp in\r\nthe county. Mr. William Watson, writing in the shade of the Emperor Yew\r\nby Newlands Corner, thought of the Roman legionaries encamped on Farley\r\nHeath below the downs, and one of the finest passages in the poem he\r\nmade there belongs half to the yew and half to Farley:--\r\n\r\n    Nay, hid by thee from Summer's gaze\r\n      That seeks in vain this couch of loam,\r\n    I should behold, without amaze,\r\n      Camped on yon down the hosts of Rome,\r\n    Nor start though English woodlands heard\r\n    The selfsame mandatory word\r\n\r\n    As by the Cataracts of the Nile\r\n      Marshalled the legions long ago,\r\n    Or where the lakes are one blue smile\r\n      'Neath pageants of Helvetian snow,\r\n    Or 'mid the Syrian sands that lie\r\n    Sick of the day's great tearless eye,\r\n\r\n    Or on barbaric plains afar,\r\n      Where, under Asia's fevering ray,\r\n    The long lines of imperial war\r\n      O'er Tigris passed, and with dismay\r\n    In fanged and iron deserts found\r\n    Embattled Persia closing round,\r\n\r\n    And 'mid their eagles watched on high\r\n      The vultures gathering for a feast,\r\n    Till, from the quivers of the sky,\r\n      The gorgeous star-flight of the East\r\n    Flamed, and the bow of darkness bent\r\n    O'er Julian dying in his tent.\r\n\r\nBetween Farley Heath and Chilworth Station, which is the chosen end of\r\nthe walk from Cranleigh, is Blackheath, well named. In winter the\r\nflowerless heather darkens the whole moorland; and through it the roads,\r\nthe rough roads the Roman legionaries knew well, run ribands of white\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chertsey._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHERTSEY\r\n\r\n    Through the hayfields.--The Abbey.--John de Rutherwyk.--Cowley in\r\n    his garden.--Bill Sikes at Chertsey.--The curfew.--A duel of\r\n    hearts.--The Chertsey legend.--St. Anne's Hill.--Digging for\r\n    treasure.--St. Paul's like a mushroom.--Charles James Fox.--Sunshine\r\n    and turnips.--Triumphant rooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nChertsey might well be taken as the centre from which to explore\r\nnorth-west Surrey, but it is less generally convenient as regards the\r\nrailway than Weybridge, which allows exploration north, east, south and\r\nwest, whereas Chertsey lies on a branch line. Besides, there is the walk\r\nfrom Weybridge to Chertsey to be taken, and there are few more\r\ndelightful near the Surrey Thames. The high road from the bridge over\r\nthe Wey runs between double ribands of water; on one side lies the\r\nsunny, slow canal, edged with iris and forget-me-nots, and banked up\r\nhigher than the road; on the other, a shady stream, dun and\r\nbleak-haunted. Before the road turns into Addlestone there is a\r\nfield-path, breaking off at right angles, which leads to a wooden bridge\r\ncrossing the clear, brown little Bourne, and beyond the bridge lies\r\nChertsey Mead, one huge hayfield, bounded on the left by wooded slopes,\r\non the right by the Thames itself. Two or three narrow paths intersect\r\nthe level of waving grass; the turf underfoot is as springy as peat, and\r\nthe standing crop scents the June wind, rich with daisies and clover.\r\nBeyond Chertsey before you lies St. Anne's Hill, dark and incumbent over\r\nthe town; but you do not guess that the Thames edges that shining\r\nhayfield until you catch sight of a boat-sail, leisurely dipping and\r\nnodding under the Lombardy poplars that line the stream. The path leaves\r\nthe meadow close to Chertsey Bridge, graceful with seven stone arches.\r\n\r\nA thousand years ago Chertsey was the centre of a very large tract\r\nindeed. Chertsey Abbey, up to the Dissolution, was one of the greatest\r\nreligious houses in the kingdom, and one of the oldest. It was in\r\n666--the date is suspiciously exact--that Frithwald, viceroy of Surrey\r\nunder Wulfer, king of the Mercians, gave the land on which the building\r\nwas to stand, and he and Erkenwald, its first abbot, duly founded the\r\nAbbey. Frithwald, since he could not write, made the sign of the Cross\r\nin delivering the deed. But Frithwald's Abbey was short-lived. Perhaps\r\nit was then not much more than a little wooden church, with buildings\r\nfor its journeying priests; at all events, the Danes had no trouble in\r\nsacking it two hundred years later, when they made their foray brutally\r\ncomplete by murdering the Abbot and his ninety monks.\r\n\r\nBut Chertsey's Abbey was to rise again. Edgar rebuilt it, and his\r\nbuilding was rebuilt again by the Abbot Hugh of Winchester, early in the\r\ntwelfth century, and from that date began the great days. The Abbot and\r\nconvent were in high favour with the king, and lived as well as good\r\nmonks should. They had rights of warren and liberty of the chase, they\r\nhad the right to keep dogs, and they might take hares and foxes, the\r\nneighbouring manor of Egham sent them fifty fat hogs a year, Chobham\r\nsent them a hundred and thirty, Byfleet sent them 325 eels, and\r\nPetersham contributed 1,000 eels and 1,000 lampreys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chertsey Bridge._]\r\n\r\nOther manors swelled the noble list. Such good living should produce a\r\ngood man, and Chertsey's great Abbot has left an abiding name. He was\r\nJohn de Rutherwyk, an ardent and admirable landlord and a prelate of\r\nenduring energy and wisdom. No squire of modern days ever did more to\r\nimprove his property. He built chapels and rebuilt churches; he laid out\r\nroads and had pathways raised from the level of flooded meadows; he set\r\nup mills and threw bridges over streams; he sowed oak plantations and\r\ntaught forestry; he planned barns and granges for corn, and dug stews\r\nand ponds for fish, and he was as enthusiastic a churchman as he was\r\nenergetic as a farmer. He died in 1347, and two hundred years later,\r\nchiefly owing to his energy and foresight, the manors which had once\r\nbeen Chertsey's were paying to Henry VIII some L700 a year--perhaps\r\nL14,000 of our money.\r\n\r\nOf all that great Abbey there remains scarcely one stone upon another.\r\nAn arch and part of an arch, a ruined wall, and the foundations of a\r\nbarn; so much and no more can be seen as John de Rutherwyk saw it. A\r\nnumber of faced and dressed stones are built in haphazard among the\r\nbricks of neighbouring walls; and the rest of the Abbey, unseen and\r\nunknown, drains Chertsey's foundations and paves her streets. Surely\r\nnever a great house fell so low and so far.\r\n\r\nChertsey's main street is wide and bright, and at its side lies a pond\r\nthrough which the carthorses go plunging. But the town's most notable\r\nbuilding stands in the narrower road from the main street to the south.\r\nThis is the old Porch House, where Abraham Cowley, the poet laureate,\r\nspent the last two years of his life, seeking in the solitudes of his\r\ngarden and the fields of his farm the rest and freedom which the\r\ningratitude of Charles II had forgotten to find for a faithful servant.\r\nIt was from Porch House that he wrote to John Evelyn, dedicating to him\r\nhis essay _The Garden_ with its pathetic opening:--\"I never had any\r\ndesire so strong, and so like to covetousness as that which I have had\r\nalways, that I might be master at last of a small house and large\r\ngarden, with very moderate conveniences joined to them, and there\r\ndedicate the remainder of my life only to the culture of them and study\r\nof nature.\" Cowley was no lover of the town. _The Garden_ holds his\r\nphilosophy:--\r\n\r\n    \"Who, that has reason, and his smell,\r\n    Would not among roses and jasmine dwell,\r\n      Rather than all his spirits choke\r\n    With exhalations of dirt and smoke\r\n      And all the uncleanness which does drown\r\n    In pestilential clouds a populous town?\"\r\n\r\nHis simpler pleasures were of the orchard and the farm. The husbandman\r\nof fruit and flowers is king:--\r\n\r\n    \"He bids the ill-natured crab produce\r\n    The gentler apple's winy juice;\r\n    The golden fruit that worthy is\r\n    Of Galatea's purple kiss;\r\n    He does the savage hawthorn teach\r\n    To bear the medlar and the pear.\r\n    He bids the rustic plum to rear\r\n    A noble trunk, and be a peach.\r\n    Even Daphne's coyness he does mock,\r\n    And weds the cherry to her stock,\r\n    Though she refused Apollo's suit,\r\n    Even she, that chaste and virgin tree,\r\n    Now wonders at herself, to see\r\n    That she's a mother made, and blushes in her fruit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cowley's Cottage, Chertsey._]\r\n\r\nPoor Cowley! The country was too much for him after all. Late on a July\r\nevening, after helping his haymakers to get in their last loads, he was\r\nsoaked with a heavy summer dew. He caught cold and died, on July 28,\r\n1667, and the Thames bore his coffin to burial in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nLess easy to find, if in some ways more familiar, than Porch House, is\r\nthe very house into which the unwilling Oliver Twist was thrust by Bill\r\nSikes mounted upon the stooping Toby Crackit. You can see the window\r\nthrough which Mr. Sikes pointed the pistol, and the door from which\r\nburst the valiant Mr. Giles and Mr. Brittles in pursuit. Or, at least,\r\nthe more devout of Dickens students are thus privileged; I have been\r\nless fortunate. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, I believe, has identified the\r\nhouse to the satisfaction of many with Pyrcroft, a dwelling north-west\r\nof the station. But I have gone burgling after Bill Sikes and followed\r\nthe road precisely as Dickens describes it, and Pyrcroft I never came\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nChertsey still keeps up some fascinating customs. She has two quaintly\r\nnamed fairs, \"Black Cherry Fair\" on August 6, and \"Goose and Onion Fair\"\r\non September 26, when she presides over the selling of horses and\r\npoultry. But the oldest and best custom is the ringing of the curfew\r\nbell, which still peals out to St. Anne's Hill and over Chertsey Mead\r\nfrom September 29 to March 25. The Chertsey bells are some of the finest\r\nin the country. The original curfew bell, which is supposed to have hung\r\nin the Abbey, tolled for the funeral of Henry VI, murdered a few hours\r\nbefore in the Tower of London, and hurried to Chertsey to be buried\r\n\"without priest, clerk, torch or taper, singing or saying.\" According to\r\nthe safer chronicles, the dead king's body was ferried to the Abbey by\r\nwater. But Shakespeare in _Richard III_ sends the corpse through London\r\nstreets \"borne in an open coffin; gentlemen bearing halberds to guard\r\nit; and Lady Anne as mourner.\" It is when Lady Anne, widow of the\r\nmurdered king's son, tells the bearers to go \"toward Chertsey with your\r\nholy load,\" that the coffin is stopped by the murderer Gloucester, and\r\nthen follows that strange duel of hearts and words between the murderer\r\nand the prince's widow:\r\n\r\n    GLOSTER.    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made\r\n    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\r\n    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\r\n    Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\r\n    Which, if thou please to hide in this true breast,\r\n    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,\r\n    I lay it open to the deadly stroke,\r\n    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\r\n\r\n[_He lays his breast open. She offers at it with his sword._\r\n\r\n    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,--\r\n    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\r\n    Nay, now despatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,--\r\n\r\n[_She again offers at his breast._\r\n\r\n    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\r\n\r\n[_She lets fall the sword._\r\n\r\n    Take up the sword again or take up me.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,\r\n    I will not be thy executioner.\r\n\r\n    GLO. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. I have already.\r\n\r\n    GLO.                  That was in thy rage;\r\n    Speak it again, and, even with the word,\r\n    This hand, which for thy love, did kill thy love,\r\n    Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love:\r\n    To both their deaths shalt thou be necessary.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.\r\n\r\n    GLO. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. I fear me both are false.\r\n\r\n    GLO. Then never man was true.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. Well, well, put up your sword.\r\n\r\n    GLO. Say, then, my peace is made.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.\r\n\r\n    GLO. But shall I live in hope?\r\n\r\n    ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.\r\n\r\n    GLO. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.\r\n\r\n    ANNE. To take, is not to give.\r\n\r\n[_She puts on the ring._\r\n\r\nKing Henry's funeral is history; another tale of the Chertsey curfew\r\nbell is legend. It was first put into the form of a story and dramatised\r\nby a now almost forgotten novelist-poet, Albert Smith, who was born at\r\nChertsey himself, and wrote books which were illustrated by Leech. He\r\ncalled his story _Blanche Heriot: a Legend of the Chertsey Church_, and\r\nthe play in its outline follows the legend. Blanche's lover, Neville,\r\nthe nephew of Warwick the Kingmaker, had been captured by the Yorkists\r\nand condemned to die on Chertsey Mead within twenty-four hours. There\r\nwas a hope of reprieve if he could send his ring as a token to the king.\r\nHe sent it, but the messenger returning with the pardon was late, and\r\nthe twenty-four hours were up while the reprieve was being carried over\r\nLaleham Ferry. But the knell for the death-stroke never sounded; Blanche\r\nhad climbed the curfew tower and held the clapper of the great bell. The\r\nstory has always been popular locally, but it first reached a really\r\nwide audience, perhaps, when Mr. Clifford Harrison embodied it in his\r\npoem _The Legend of Chertsey_. Since then, reciters' audiences have had\r\ntheir fill.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile outside the town lies St. Anne's Hill, chiefly notable,\r\nperhaps, to-day because on its southern slope stands a house which was\r\nat one time the residence of Charles James Fox. Its older title to fame\r\nwas the magnificence of its view. On the highest point stood St. Anne's\r\nChapel, of which the half-buried ruin of but a single wall remains. It\r\nis, Aubrey remarks, \"a most romancy place, from whence you have the\r\nProspect over Middlesex and Surrey, London, to Hertfordshire and St.\r\nAlbans, Berks, Bucks, Oxfordshire, to Windsor Castle, St. Martha's\r\nChapel, Hampton Court, Kingston, Hampshire, etc.\" Eight counties is a\r\nnoble stretch of England. But to-day the view has lost most of its\r\ngrandeur. The hill has been thickly planted with trees, conifers for the\r\nmost part, and the view can only be had in peeps and patches. Forty or\r\nfifty years ago, before the pines were planted, there stood on the hill\r\nthree sister elms, a proud mark for all the country round. One alone\r\nremains, fenced in with iron and hollow, and still a splendid tree; but\r\nher shade falls on altered ground. Before the middle of the last century\r\nthe level stretch of soil to the south was ploughland: it is now a level\r\nmead of green, glowing with bordering rhododendrons in June, and bitten\r\nclose and smooth by rabbits. It is amusing to notice the fineness of the\r\nturf within three or four yards of the rhododendrons all round the\r\ngreen; the rabbits are \"poor men,\" like Chuchundra, and afraid to come\r\nout into the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nBesides the ruins of St. Anne's Chapel, which is not very much to look\r\nat, and at which very few look, there are two other relics on the hill.\r\nOne is a spring, welling up under an arch. It is still what Aubrey\r\ndescribes it to be, \"a fine clear spring dressed with squared stones,\"\r\nand up to within recent years the country folk round about have been\r\nused to fetch away water from it, in the belief that it has virtues as\r\nan eye lotion. It has a strong taste of iron; would that be good for the\r\neyes? Another curiosity is the so-called Devil's Stone, or Treasure\r\nStone. Aubrey calls this \"a conglobation of gravel and sand,\" and says\r\nthat the inhabitants know it as \"the Devil's Stone, and believe it\r\ncannot be mov'd, and that treasure is hid underneath.\" There have been\r\nmany searchers after the treasure. One of them once dug down ten feet or\r\nmore, hoping to come to the base of the huge mass, but his task grew\r\nunkinder as he got deeper, and he gave it up. He might well do so, for\r\nwhat is pretty certain is that he was trying to dig up St. Anne's Hill.\r\nAll over the face of the hill there are masses of this hard pebbly\r\nsandstone cropping up, though they are not so noticeable as the\r\nso-called Devil's Stone because they are flat and occasionally\r\ncrumbling, and have not had their sides laid bare by energetic\r\ntreasure-seekers.\r\n\r\nThe view from the hill has not, of course, been wholly lost. To the\r\nsouth the trees shut it out almost entirely, so that part of Hampshire\r\nand all Sussex disappear. Looking to the west you can see the pines on\r\nChobham Common, and perhaps Bagshot Heath beyond, but you can no longer\r\nget a sight of Windsor Castle, for the trees have grown up on Cooper's\r\nHill, which lies between. To the north the church spire on the hill at\r\nHarrow stands beautifully up from the horizon; the Wembley Tower, which\r\nused to scar the distance, has gone. Eastward lie two familiar towers;\r\nand you are reminded of Mr. Max Beerbohm's reflective observation that\r\n\"the great danger of travelling on the South Eastern Railway is that you\r\nmight put your head out of the window and catch sight of the Crystal\r\nPalace.\" So much the greater by contrast is the loss of Windsor Castle\r\nto the north-west. I have never yet, by the way, had the good fortune to\r\nget to the top of St. Anne's Hill on a really clear day. I have been\r\ninformed by the lodge-keeper that the best time to get a view is in the\r\nsummer immediately the sun is up and before the London fires are\r\nlighted. You can then see all the big London buildings, the Clock Tower,\r\nand the Houses of Parliament, and \"the dome of St. Paul's as plain as a\r\nmushroom in the field.\"\r\n\r\nFox lived at the house at St. Anne's Hill in his quieter old age. Samuel\r\nRogers in his _Table Talk_ draws a pleasant picture of his life among\r\nhis books and farm buildings:--\r\n\r\n    \"When I became acquainted with Fox, he had given up that kind of\r\n    life (gambling, etc.) entirely, and resided in the most perfect\r\n    sobriety and regularity at St. Anne's Hill. There he was very happy,\r\n    delighting in study, in rural occupations and rural prospects. He\r\n    would break from a criticism on Porson's _Euripides_ to look for the\r\n    little pigs. I remember his calling out to the Chertsey hills, when\r\n    a thick mist, which had for some time concealed them, rolled away:\r\n    'Good morning to you! I am glad to see you again.' There was a walk\r\n    in his grounds which led to a lane through which the farmers used to\r\n    pass; and he would stop them, and talk to them, with great\r\n    interest, about the price of turnips, etc. I was one day with him in\r\n    the Louvre, when he suddenly turned from the pictures, and, looking\r\n    out at the window, exclaimed, 'This hot sun will burn up my turnips\r\n    at St. Anne's Hill.'\"\r\n\r\nIn his later life, Fox's chief delight was almost wholly in his garden,\r\nand in country sights and sounds. It was with the greatest difficulty\r\nthat he could be dragged to London. On one occasion, in the throes of a\r\npolitical crisis, he was induced to leave St. Anne's Hill on the\r\nunderstanding that he would have to remain only two nights in town. When\r\nhe heard that the debate was postponed owing to Pitt's indisposition, he\r\nwas, Lord Holland relates, \"silent and overcome, as if the intelligence\r\nof some great calamity had reached his ears. I saw tears steal down his\r\ncheeks; so vexed was he at being detained from his garden, his books,\r\nand his cheerful life in the country.\" On another occasion, begged to go\r\nto town, Fox answered that he would do so if he thought his going would\r\nbe serviceable to the public, but the idea greatly troubled him. \"Never\r\ndid a letter,\" he wrote, \"arrive at a worse time than yours this\r\nmorning. A sweet westerly wind, a beautiful sun, all the thorns and elms\r\njust budding, and the nightingales just beginning to sing; though the\r\nblackbirds and thrushes would have been quite sufficient to have refuted\r\nany arguments in your letter. Seriously speaking, I cannot conceive what\r\nyou mean by everybody agreeing that something may be now done. I beg, at\r\nleast, not to be included in the holders of that opinion.\"\r\n\r\nFox's favourite bird was the nightingale; and he used to sit for hours\r\non a particular seat listening to its song. The St. Anne's Hill garden\r\nis still very much as he left it; the Temple of Peace, in which Ariosto\r\nwas his most intimate companion, stands undisturbed, a quaint testimony\r\nto the love of summerhouses in the form of temples which Fox inherited\r\nfrom his father. Another summerhouse, lined with shells and quartz, is\r\nso like the monstrosity built by the Duke of Newcastle in Oatlands Park\r\nat Weybridge that probably Fox copied it, on a smaller scale; and near\r\nby stands the inscription, carved on stone, of Fox's favourite verses\r\nfrom Dryden:\r\n\r\n    \"The painted birds, companions of the Spring,\r\n    Hopping from spray to spray were heard to sing.\r\n    Both eyes and ears received a like delight,\r\n    Enchanting music, and a charming sight.\r\n\r\n    On Philomel I fixed my whole desire,\r\n    And listened for the queen of all the quire.\r\n    Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing,\r\n    And wanted yet an omen to the Spring.\r\n\r\n           *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung\r\n    That the grove echoed, and the valleys rung.\"\r\n\r\nIt must remain a problem to discover why such verse should be associated\r\nwith the singing of nightingales. Perhaps the nightingales dislike the\r\nassociation; at all events, I am told that they have deserted St. Anne's\r\nHill. If they have, it is a strange conclusion to the years of close\r\nprotection which a former owner of St. Anne's Hill extended to her\r\nbirds. The late Lady Holland would never have a singing bird killed nor\r\na nest touched in all her grounds, and if one of them was found dead in\r\nany of the shrubberies, her orders were that it was to be given a prompt\r\nand respectable burial. Jays and magpies, however, she could not abide,\r\nnor crows and rooks, and a curious story is told of a rookery which\r\nthese birds tried to establish near the house. Every year they decided\r\nto build in a particular tree, and every year they were shot or\r\notherwise driven away. At last Lady Holland died, and the gardeners\r\ngladly laid aside their guns. The very next spring the rookery was\r\nfirmly established, and has cawed its paeans ever since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Byway near Weybridge._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWEYBRIDGE\r\n\r\n    A Georgian village.--The Kembles.--A prophetic lament.--Wey no\r\n    more.--The Brooklands bucket.--Exiles.--Riddles of spelling.--A\r\n    royal palace.--The Duchess's Monkeys.--Oatlands cedars.--Portmore\r\n    Park.--St. George's Hill.--The Leveller's Beanfields.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a pleasant melancholy in trying to imagine a Georgian\r\nWeybridge. Fanny Kemble describes the village as she saw it as a girl,\r\nbefore the railway came. Then, in the twenties, it was \"a rural, rather\r\ndeserted-looking, and most picturesque village, with the desolate domain\r\nof Portmore Park, its mansion falling to ruin, on one side of it, and on\r\nthe other the empty house and fine park of Oatlands, the former\r\nresidence of the Duke of York.\" Eighty years have gone, and the\r\ndeserted-looking village has spread into a town and suburbs covering\r\nmore than a square mile of ground; Portmore Park has vanished; Oatlands\r\nis a hotel. The railway has created one more residential neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFanny Kemble first came to Weybridge as a fifteen-year-old school-girl,\r\nand spent three summers with her family at Eastlands, a little cottage,\r\nstill to be seen, on the outskirts of the village, of which she has\r\nwritten some amusing reminiscences. Charles Kemble, the actor, her\r\nfather, used to come down from Saturday to Monday, but had no great\r\nappreciation of country life, or, perhaps, rather of the cottage, which\r\nwas too small for him; \"he was as nearly as possible too high and too\r\nwide, too long and too large, for every room in the house.\" But Fanny\r\nKemble herself and her mother enjoyed the country to the full. Mrs.\r\nKemble had a passion for fishing, and she and her children used to spend\r\nher days on the banks of the Wey, apparently with the slightest possible\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nA curious relic remains of the Kembles' Weybridge holidays. This is to\r\nbe seen in the Eastlands' cottage garden, and is a semi-circular heap of\r\nearth or sand planted with trees and shrubs. Once, when it was much\r\nlarger and higher, it was \"the Mound,\" and was the favourite playground\r\nof the Kemble girls and boys. It grew out of a huge heap of sand which\r\nthe landlord refused to move, and which Mrs. Kemble therefore planted\r\nand cut into shape with a walk round the top. Naturally enough,\r\ntradition has grown up round this heap of sand. Fanny Kemble was a\r\nfamous actress, and lived here as a child; therefore this mound was a\r\ntheatre. It is locally known indeed as \"the theatre.\" But I can find no\r\nevidence that it was ever used as anything of the kind; certainly Fanny\r\nKemble never refers to it as a theatre, nor as anything else but a\r\n\"domestic fortification\" and a \"delightful playground.\" To her it is\r\nalways \"the Mound.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weybridge._]\r\n\r\nIf that charming and brilliant lady could revisit these glimpses of the\r\nmoon, what would she say of that infinitely larger \"mound\" and its\r\nsurroundings in the new motor track, with which it is Weybridge's\r\nunhappy fate to be linked to-day? Nearly a square mile of quiet meadow\r\nand forest and hill slashed and scarred and scarped into a saucer of\r\ncement; acres of pine and cedar and oak and rhododendron smashed and\r\nsawn to fragments; the roar of thundering Napiers and Hotchkisses, where\r\nonce the reed-warblers climbed the meadowsweet and cuckoos called from\r\nthe willows--how would she have addressed the originator of that\r\nstaring blatant racecourse? Strangely enough, she saw something of the\r\nkind befall her beloved Weybridge pinewoods sixty-seven years ago, and\r\nwrote of it in her diary. She was staying as a guest at Oatlands, and\r\nfound one of her favourite walks among the Brooklands trees destroyed.\r\nHer outcry is prophetic:--\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord King, Lord King (we were riding through the property of the\r\n    Earl of Lovelace, then Lord King), if I was one of those bishops\r\n    whom you do not love, I would curse, excommunicate and anathematize\r\n    you for cutting down all those splendid trees and laying bare those\r\n    deep, leafy nooks, the haunts of a thousand _Midsummer Nights'\r\n    Dreams_, to the common air and the staring sun. The sight of the\r\n    dear old familiar paths brought the tears to my eyes, for, stripped\r\n    and thinned of their trees and robbed of their beauty, my memory\r\n    restored all their former loveliness. On we went down to Byefleet to\r\n    the mill, to Langton's through the sweet, turfy meadows, by hawthorn\r\n    hedges musical as sweet....\"\r\n\r\nWell, she could not do that now. Let an ornithologist poet lament the\r\nchange:--\r\n\r\n    By Brooklands hill but since a year\r\n      Untrod the meadows lay,\r\n    Unspanned through musk and meadowsweet\r\n      Ran olive-bright the Wey.\r\n\r\n    Blackbirds about that wind and wild\r\n      Carolled a roguish choir,\r\n    From willow green to willow grey\r\n      Kingfishers shot sapphire!\r\n\r\n    There gay and far the Surrey sun\r\n      Spread cowslips far and gay,\r\n    Lit wide the orchid's purple flame,\r\n      The white fire of the May;\r\n\r\n    And thither stole a happy boat\r\n      To hear the ringdoves coo,\r\n    To mark again the drumming snipe\r\n      Zigzag the April blue:\r\n\r\n    To watch the darting dragon-flies\r\n      Live pine-needles awing--\r\n    O Brooklands meadow, there we knew\r\n      You first knew all the spring!\r\n\r\n    And then--the change! Spade, engine, pick,\r\n      The gangers' myriad Hun,\r\n    A thousand branches' banished shade,\r\n      Flat glare of sand and sun.\r\n\r\n    From pine and stream to steam and stone,\r\n      From peace to din and pain,\r\n    From old unused to new unuse,\r\n      But never Wey again!\r\n\r\nThe motor course led to at least one interesting discovery. When the\r\npicks were hard at work in the sand, and day and night were enlivened\r\nby steam-engines and casual labourers sleeping off their wages in other\r\npeople's summerhouses, there went about a word of a great find. A pot of\r\ncopper had been found, some said; of coppers, said others; of Roman gold\r\ncoins, there was a rumour, and all the coins exchanged for beer. Perhaps\r\nsome coins were found; what certainly was found was a beautifully made\r\nbronze bucket, buried deep below clay and sand in a bed of gravel. It\r\nhas been classified by the experts as belonging to a Venetian workshop\r\nof the seventh century B.C.--actually the early days of the Tarquins.\r\nPrehistoric traffic between Britain and Italy may not be an entirely new\r\nidea, but the bucket opens a new chapter.\r\n\r\nA few years after the Kembles had given up their cottage Weybridge had\r\nother brilliant visitors. The French Revolution of 1848 drove abroad\r\nthinkers and writers and a royal family, and Weybridge saw most of them.\r\nJohn Austin, author of _The Province of Jurisprudence Determined_,\r\nsettled with his wife at a sober, red brick building near the church,\r\nand there they were visited by Lavergne, and Victor Cousin and de\r\nRemusat and Guizot: Barthelemy St. Hilaire wrote to Mrs. Austin in\r\n1854--\"I assure you that Weybridge is the place in England I love best.\"\r\nThere were royal exiles at Claremont near Esher, then, and they came to\r\nmass at the Roman Catholic chapel which fronts the common; Louis\r\nPhilippe and Queen Amelie, and the Duchess of Orleans and the Comte de\r\nParis; there is a monument in the chapel to the Duchess of Nemours, who\r\ndied at Claremont in 1857. _Tot luctuosis domus Aurelianensis addita\r\nfuneribus_ is the inscription, and the glorious beauty of the white\r\nmarble lights the chapel; she was only thirty-four.\r\n\r\nWeybridge's church is modern, but the registers and churchwarden's\r\naccounts are old and amusing. The following items, taken at random from\r\nthe lengthy and exact copy made by Miss Eleanor Lloyd in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_, are pleasant riddles of spelling:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  L _s. d._\r\n\r\n    1622.

Weybridge\r\nwould have always followed royal doings with interest, for Weybridge\r\nhistory, bound up with its oldest and greatest mansion, goes back to the\r\nkings almost of the middle ages. On the ground, or near it, which now\r\nbelongs to the Oatlands Park Hotel, Henry VIII built one of his finest\r\npalaces: Elizabeth followed her father and hunted deer in the park;\r\nJames I added to the palace a silkworm room for Anne of Denmark, planted\r\nmulberry trees to feed the silkworms, and bred pheasants to please\r\nhimself; Charles I killed his stags and encroached on private ground to\r\nkill more; his youngest son, Prince Henry of Oatlands, was born in the\r\npalace. But Charles was the last English king to hunt at Oatlands. After\r\nthe Civil wars the land was disparked, and the palace fell into ruins.\r\nTo-day hardly a vestige remains. Old drawings show it to have been a\r\nlarge, straggling building with one great court and a number of smaller\r\nyards and quadrangles, turreted and gabled and quaint with tall and\r\ndelicate chimneys. The oddest neighbour for Weybridge of to-day! It is\r\nnot always difficult to re-people an old house, even if it has been\r\ngreatly altered, with the ghosts of great men who have walked its\r\npassages and worked in its rooms. But among the newness and smallness of\r\nmodern building plots there is nothing so hard as to conjure the ghost\r\nof a great palace, vibrating with the energy and the obsequiousness, the\r\nsimplicities and the intrigues of a hunting King and his Court.\r\n\r\nGeorgian days brought another being as a visitor. Oatlands came to the\r\nseventh Earl of Lincoln in 1716, and he built himself a house on the\r\nhigher ground overlooking a fine stretch of water and many miles of\r\nThameside country. From his son, who had inherited the dukedom of\r\nNewcastle, this house was bought by the Duke of York in 1794, but was\r\nburnt down the same year, and the royal Duke rebuilt it. He and his\r\nduchess lived there until 1820, when she died. It must have been a\r\ncurious household. George III brought Queen Charlotte there, and the\r\nCourt with her; Georgian wits and beauties gathered in the duke's\r\ndining-rooms and played cards in his grottoes. Charles Greville was\r\noften at Oatlands, and Sheridan and Beau Brummell and Horace Walpole;\r\nMrs. Gwyn came there, and Mrs. Bunbury, Oliver Goldsmith's \"Jessamy\r\nbride\" and \"Little Comedy.\" Both were buried in Weybridge old church.\r\nSamuel Rogers, in his _Table-talk_, gives a quaint picture of the\r\nhousehold:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have several times stayed at Oatlands with the Duke and Duchess\r\n    of York--both of them most amiable and agreeable persons. We were\r\n    generally a company of about fifteen; and our being invited to\r\n    remain there 'another day' sometimes depended on the ability of our\r\n    royal host and hostess to raise sufficient money for our\r\n    entertainment. We used to have all sorts of ridiculous 'fun' as we\r\n    roamed about the grounds. The Duchess kept (besides a number of\r\n    dogs, for which there was a regular burial-place) a collection of\r\n    monkeys, each of which had its own pole with a house at top. One of\r\n    the visitors (whose name I forget) would single out a particular\r\n    monkey, and play to it on the fiddle with such fury and perseverance\r\n    that the poor animal, half distracted, would at last take refuge in\r\n    the arms of Lord Alvanley.--Monk Lewis was a great favourite at\r\n    Oatlands. One day after dinner, as the Duchess was leaving the room,\r\n    she whispered something into Lewis's ear. He was much affected, his\r\n    eyes filling with tears. We asked what was the matter. 'Oh,' replied\r\n    Lewis, 'the Duchess spoke so _very_ kindly to me!'--'My dear\r\n    fellow,' said Colonel Armstrong, 'pray don't cry; I daresay she\r\n    didn't mean it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York died in 1827, and thirty years later Oatlands became a\r\nhotel. The building was greatly altered, but the grounds still keep some\r\nuntouched memorials of the past. One is an extraordinary grotto, built\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle, and used by the Duke of York and his friends,\r\naccording to local tradition, as a card-room, plentifully supplied with\r\nwine bottles. It is lined with a profusion of crystal spar and sea\r\nshells; it contains a deep bath, bashfully presided over by a statue of\r\nVenus, and the steps leading up to the door are paved with horses' teeth\r\npicked up on the battlefield of Waterloo. How the Duke of Newcastle\r\naccomplished this feat it is difficult to imagine, for he died in 1794.\r\nPerhaps they belonged to other horses, or perhaps the gallant Duke of\r\nYork made the addition. He was Commander-in-chief, and the grisly relics\r\nmay have been sent him as a present.\r\n\r\nAnother relic of the dead is the cemetery in which the Duchess of York\r\nused to bury her cats and dogs and monkeys. There may be, perhaps,\r\nthirty or forty little tombstones, each with a name.\r\n\r\nOatlands Park preserves a not very trustworthy legend. In the grounds\r\nstand a number of magnificent cedars, and one of them bears a notice by\r\nwhich you are informed that it was one of the first cedars of Lebanon\r\nplanted in England and was placed where it stands by Prince Henry of\r\nOtelands. Neither statement quite fits the facts. If Prince Henry of\r\nOatlands planted the cedar, he must have done so either before the\r\noutbreak of the Civil War in 1642 (in which case he would have been\r\nhardly three years old, for he was born in 1639), or else in the summer\r\nof 1660, the year of the Restoration, and the year in which he died. As\r\na matter of fact, cedars were hardly known at the time, for John Evelyn\r\nin his _Sylva_, published in 1664, only mentions them as unsatisfactory\r\nseedlings, difficult to grow; and the earliest cedar planted in England\r\nis probably the Enfield cedar, which may have been set in the ground by\r\nDr. Uvedale, master of the Grammar-School, about that date. There are,\r\nin any case, much finer cedars than the Oatlands Park trees in adjoining\r\nprivate gardens. Probably all of them were planted by the Earl of\r\nLincoln or the Duke of Newcastle early in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnother of Weybridge's links with royalty is not quite so reputable.\r\nPortmore Park is the name for a large slice of the town which lies near\r\nthe river, thickly built over with villas and cut up into new roads.\r\nOnce there stood in it Ham House, which with its park was given by James\r\nII to his mistress Catherine Sedley, notorious at least as much for her\r\nwit as her features. She herself, even with the brilliant eyes which\r\nwere pretty nearly all she had of good looks, could not understand the\r\nking's infatuation. \"It cannot be my beauty,\" she said; \"for he must see\r\nthat I have none; and it cannot be my wit; for he has not enough to know\r\nthat I have any.\" Whatever the attraction may have been, he made her\r\nCountess of Dorchester and gave her Ham House, and she very prudently\r\nmarried David Colyear, first Lord Portmore. The gates of her park\r\nsurvive her; the house has disappeared.\r\n\r\nOne great estate still remains, and on its hill the oldest settlement of\r\nthe neighbourhood. The generosity of the Egerton family throws open to\r\nthe public, in the woods of St. George's Hill, some hundreds of acres of\r\npine forest and heather. On the summit of the hill stands a large\r\nprehistoric camp, where neolithic Wey-siders in Wey beaver-fur and\r\nbuckskin entrenched their wives and their cattle. There are fifteen or\r\nsixteen of these ancient British camps in Surrey or just over the\r\nborder; this is the largest, and the height and strength of its\r\nearthworks are admirable. It is more than three-quarters of a mile in\r\ncircumference, and since it is obviously a camp, has naturally been set\r\ndown as Caesar's. But that is the fate of anything old which looks like a\r\nfortification--part of the traditional method of assigning otherwise\r\ninexplicable phenomena to their proper agents. Camps are all Caesar's,\r\nCromwell made all the ruins, and all geological wonders belong to the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nSt. George's Hill, or rather the low-lying ground on the Cobham side of\r\nit, was once the scene of a curious agricultural experiment. In the late\r\ndays of the Parliamentary wars the Levellers sent some thirty men, under\r\nleaders named Everard and Winstanley, to seize part of the common land\r\nand plant roots and beans. Fairfax sent two troops of horse after them,\r\nand the captured Everard made him a speech, in which he claimed that he\r\nhad had a vision instructing him to dig and plough the earth for the\r\nbenefit of the poor, and that his mission was to help his oppressed\r\nfellow-Israelites back to their rights over all landed and other\r\nproperty. The Digger-Socialist did not give Fairfax much more trouble,\r\nfor the irate commoners, refusing to be delivered from bondage, drove\r\nthe Levellers from their common and pulled up the roots and beans.\r\n\r\nThe Levellers have their poet, and he made them a song with a fine lilt.\r\nHere are the first three stanzas:\r\n\r\n    You noble Diggers all, stand up now, stand up now,\r\n        You noble Diggers all, stand up now,\r\n    The wast land to maintain, seeing Cavaliers by name\r\n    Your digging does disdaine, and persons all defame.\r\n            Stand up now, stand up now.\r\n\r\n    Your houses they pull down, stand up now, stand up now,\r\n        Your houses they pull down, stand up now.\r\n    Your houses they pull down to fright poor men in town,\r\n    But the gentry must come down, and the poor shall wear the crown.\r\n            Stand up now, Diggers all.\r\n\r\n    With spades and hoes and plows, stand up now, stand up now,\r\n        With spades and hoes and plows, stand up now,\r\n    Your freedom to withhold, seeing Cavaliers are bold\r\n    To kill you if they could, and rights from you to hold.\r\n            Stand up now, Diggers all.\r\n\r\nAlthough not one of the highest of Surrey hills, St. George's Hill\r\nprovides a series of delightful glimpses of distant scenery through the\r\ntrees. Windsor Castle stands up like a battleship on the horizon to the\r\nnorth-west, twelve miles away: west lie the rolling open spaces of\r\nChobham Common and Bagshot Heath; south-west Guildford and Godalming\r\nstand over the shining valley of the Wey; Ranmer Church spire marks\r\nDorking to the south: Leatherhead, Epsom, and the Crystal Palace almost\r\ncomplete the ring. I have never seen St. Paul's. But the abiding charm\r\nof St. George's Hill is not the view, which is surpassed by a dozen\r\nothers. It is the deep quiet of the place; the sound of the wind in the\r\ntrees, even on windless days, like the sound of the sea in a shell; the\r\nscented pine-needle carpet, crinkling in the sun; the bracken and\r\nbluebells of May, and the crimsons and purples of June's profuse\r\nrhododendrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nNORTH TO RUNEMEDE\r\n\r\n    Virginia Water.--Ruined Temples.--Grebes and Pheasants.--Bishop's\r\n    Gate.--Shelley's \"Alastor.\"--\"Perdita\" at Englefield Green.--Mrs.\r\n    Oliphant's Neighbours.--Runemede rolled.--Egham's Almshouses.--Sir\r\n    John Denham.--Frightful Monuments.--King Charles and the grateful\r\n    stag.--The quiet of Thorpe.--The Crouch Oak.--Love Philtres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ruins at Virginia Water._]\r\n\r\nThere is no better way of roaming through north-west Surrey than to take\r\nthe train to Virginia Water station, which is as near as you can get to\r\nthe county boundary by the railway, and then to set out almost along the\r\nboundary northwards till the Thames turns the road south again at\r\nRunemede. Virginia Water itself lies more than a mile from the station,\r\nand is not at its best on Saturdays and Sundays. On quieter week days\r\nthere is no lovelier stretch of woodland lake-water. It is, of course,\r\nnot a natural sheet, but its designer had skill enough to know what\r\nwould not look unnatural. He was Thomas Sandby, Royal Academician and\r\nDeputy-Ranger of Windsor Park, and one of the great landscape gardeners\r\nof Georgian days. He planned the lake for the Duke of Cumberland, Ranger\r\nof Windsor Park after Culloden, and he made it by choking back a number\r\nof small streams that trickled through a reedy marsh, and so spreading a\r\nsingle floor of shining water over the whole valley. The trees, or most\r\nof them, that stand about the banks have grown since the Duke saw the\r\nwater. There are old oaks on the northern shore, but the southern and\r\neastern sides were planted with spruce and other conifers at the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century and beginning of the nineteenth, when all that\r\nremained of the victor of Culloden was his horrible nickname and his\r\nobelisk above the lake. The trees are glorious in December or June,\r\nwhen the green leaf is high on the beeches or the copper leaf strewn\r\nbelow them, and in any month of the year the thick, deep moss of the\r\nopen glades is a carpet to delight to walk upon. But not all Sandby's\r\nlandscape gardening has an equal charm. The cascade which drains the\r\noutflow of the water is a pretentious pile which no doubt filled the eye\r\nof the royal Ranger, and perhaps would have pleased John Evelyn, but it\r\nsuits a simpler taste very little. But \"the ruins\"--it is their vague\r\nand proper name--are worse. Once, on the southern shore, stood a\r\nclassical temple. It was the genuine article; the pillars were brought\r\ndirect from Tripoli; the Ranger of the day (for they were added after\r\nthe Cumberland era) liked to have them there, and thought that the\r\nbeauty of English woodlands was enhanced by a pagan altar and Greek\r\nporticoes. Northern rains and northern ivy have done their work, and\r\n\"the ruins\" remain--capitals, columns, and pedestals shouting a thousand\r\nCockney scribbles, tumbled headlong under laurel and yew.\r\n\r\nLike other large stretches of Surrey water, the lake has become the home\r\nof wildfowl once passing from the stage of rarity to extinction, but now\r\nincreasing and more often seen. The reeds that line parts of the shore\r\nare the happy homes of coots and water hens, but mallards and ducks are\r\ncommon on the water, and I have watched more than one pair of great\r\ngrebes, conspicuous on the level lake with their gleaming necks and\r\nchestnut ruffs, swimming and diving close in the shore.\r\n\r\nPadlocked gates prevent you from walking precisely as you please from\r\nthe north-east of the lake through Windsor Park, and it is not\r\nimpossible to miss the right path through the trees. But if you are\r\nwalking north from the lake it is worth while to make your way to the\r\nCumberland obelisk--a gaunt column which the clustering ivy and shrubs\r\nat its base will some day topple down among the grass and heather--and\r\nto reach the Bishop's Gate through the single narrow stretch of Windsor\r\nGreat Park that lies in Surrey. In winter, pheasants crouch under the\r\nbrushwood or splutter through the trees; in summer the rhododendrons\r\nscent and empurple the woodland rides.\r\n\r\nBelow Bishop's Gate, which is a yard or two over the Berkshire border,\r\nlies the little hamlet of the same name where Shelley, the year before\r\nhis marriage to Mary Godwin, spent a happy summer and wrote \"Alastor.\"\r\nHe was supposed to be dying of consumption, and was to live as much as\r\nhe could in the open air; and from Bishop's Gate he began an expedition\r\nup the Thames, which took a fortnight of the warm July of 1815. He began\r\n\"Alastor\" in the glades of Windsor Park in the summer, and that strange\r\nand brooding poem is full of the splendour of the Windsor forest. The\r\npoet, \"led by love, or dream, or God,\" sought the \"dearest haunt\" of\r\nNature:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"More dark\r\n    And dark the shades accumulate. The oak,\r\n    Expanding its immense and knotty arms,\r\n    Embraces the light beech. The pyramids\r\n    Of the tall cedar overarching frame\r\n    Most solemn domes within, and far below,\r\n    Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,\r\n    The ash and the acacia floating hang\r\n    Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed\r\n    In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,\r\n    Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around\r\n    The gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,\r\n    With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,\r\n    Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,\r\n    These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs\r\n    Uniting their close union; the woven leaves\r\n    Make net-work of the dark blue light of day,\r\n    And the night's noontide clearness, mutable\r\n    As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns\r\n    Beneath these canopies extend their swells,\r\n    Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms\r\n    Minute yet beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a corner of Surrey, indeed, which is full of links with writers\r\nand poets. Hardly a mile to the east of Bishop's Gate is Englefield\r\nGreen, a high and breezy common surrounded by delightful old houses.\r\nPoor \"Perdita,\" Mrs. Robinson, died in one of them, deserted and\r\nforgotten by the Prince for whom she had thought her name well lost.\r\n\r\nTo a later generation Englefield became familiar, if unvisited, through\r\nMrs. Oliphant's _Neighbours on the Green_. Two of her friends in real\r\nlife who lived there were Richard Holt Hutton, essayist and theologian,\r\nand one of the greatest of English journalists; and Sir George Chesney,\r\nauthor of _The Battle of Dorking_, whom we are to meet on the scene of\r\none of his hitherto bloodless battlefields. Other neighbours, perhaps\r\neven better known, survive in the half-fiction of Mrs. Oliphant's pages.\r\n\r\nBut the most enthusiastic admirer of the neighbourhood was a poet, Sir\r\nJohn Denham. What would the author of the poem in praise of Cooper's\r\nHill say to some of the buildings which crown that \"airy mountain\"\r\nto-day? For Englefield Green stands on Cooper's Hill as Sir John saw it,\r\nand to him the common must have been part of the hill itself. To us\r\nCooper's Hill has become less a hill than a college, and will become a\r\nhill again. The buildings of the College, started with the brightest\r\nhopes to provide a special education for the Indian Civil Service in\r\n1870, and closed as a failure in 1905, stand untenanted and unhappy,\r\nfenced about with placards. There is no building quite so depressing as\r\nan empty school.\r\n\r\nOn a day of light mists one may see the view from the hill as Denham\r\nknew it, and as it was seen and known by Surrey nobles long before his\r\nday. For below the hill lies Runemede, and it needs the filmy gauze of\r\nmist to spread the meadows and trees of the Thames banks into a green\r\ncarpet, untouched with the mark of the builder and the roadmaker. But\r\nRunemede is not seen best from the hill. Best, I think, you can measure\r\nthat broad green floor by coming on it as King John might have come had\r\nhe ridden or rowed from Windsor. Then it stretches suddenly before you,\r\na level plain of springing grass, a single rich hayfield in June, as\r\nperhaps John looked out over it on the day he sealed the Charter. The\r\nmeadow and the river can have changed little in seven hundred years, and\r\nperhaps the farming of the meadow is not wholly different. But I shall\r\nalways remember the shock with which once I came upon Runemede on an\r\nopen day in March, when the farmers' men were out over all the fields\r\nwith the horses and the farm machinery. Runemede was being rolled.\r\n\r\nSouth of that great meadow, Egham stands opposite Staines, separated by\r\nthe river and a mile of dull road. Egham may have once had attractions,\r\nbut they have nearly all disappeared. Nothing old or quiet could live\r\nnear the Holloway College. A building of such appalling pretensions\r\nsears its neighbourhood like a hot iron. The town takes colour from its\r\nflamboyant arrogance; the local builder studs his rough-cast with glass,\r\nred and green and blue. Two old almshouses stand by the main street of\r\nthe town; one, a lowly set of cottage rooms, built by Sir John Denham in\r\n1624, crouches quietly apart; the other, two hundred years younger, but\r\nstill good Georgian brick, stands behind a gateway in grounds which,\r\nwhen I saw them last, were a miracle of untidiness. The almshouses, were\r\nrebuilt in 1828, when perhaps the grass round them was mown also.\r\n\r\nEpitaphs and monuments can be dull enough, but no one could call the\r\nmonuments dull which family piety has erected in Egham church to the\r\nmemory of Sir John Denham, father of the poet. Sir John, clothed in a\r\nshroud, quits his tomb at the Last Trump; below him, among skeletons and\r\nskulls, two grisly corpses writhe to the light. It is edifying to\r\nconceive the satisfaction with which Sir John's descendants must have\r\nfeasted on such horrors every Sunday. A gentler memory lives on a stone\r\nerected \"to the most dutiful, engaging, and tender child of seven years\r\nold. Miss Sarah Honywood\"; and a finer epitaph is Garrick's, written to\r\nthe memory of Thomas Beighton, a former vicar:--\r\n\r\n    \"He had no foe, and CAMDEN was his friend.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Entering Egham._]\r\n\r\nSir John Denham, the poet and unsuccessful defender of Farnham Castle in\r\nthe Parliamentary Wars, lived at the house which is now the vicarage,\r\nand from its windows looked out on the long rising slope of Cooper's\r\nHill. He has been laughed at for his description of the hill as an \"airy\r\nmountain,\" but three hundred years ago, before the hill was cut up with\r\nhedges and ditches, and when he could look across open grass to its\r\nfoot, Cooper's Hill may well have seemed higher than to-day. It is\r\nhigher than St. Anne's Hill, after all, and can make an imposing break\r\non the horizon.\r\n\r\nHere is Runemede as Sir John Denham saw it from Cooper's Hill:--\r\n\r\n    \"There lies a spatious and a fertile Greene,\r\n    Where from the woods, the _Dryades_ oft meet\r\n    The Nayades, and with their nimble feet,\r\n    Soft dances lead, although their airie shape\r\n    All but a quicke Poeticke sight escape,\r\n    There _Faunus_ and _Sylvanus_ keepe their Courts,\r\n    And thither all the horrid hoast resorts,\r\n    When like the Elixar, with his evening beames,\r\n    The sunne has turn'd to gold the silver streames.\r\n\r\n    Here have I seene our _Charles_, when great affaires\r\n    Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,\r\n    Chacing the royall Stagge, the gallant beast,\r\n    Rowz'd with the noyse 'twixt hope and feare distrest,\r\n    Resolv's 'tis better to avoyd, than meet\r\n    His danger, trusting to his winged feet.\"\r\n\r\nWhich he does, a most moving business, until at last the gallant animal\r\nturns. He stands at bay--\r\n\r\n    \"Till _Charles_ from his unerring hand lets flie\r\n    A mortall shaft, then glad, and proud to dye\r\n    By such a wound he fals, the Chrystall flood\r\n    Dying he dyes, and purples with his blood.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Egham and Thorpe to the south is one of the few fine Elizabethan\r\nhouses in the county, pleasantly named Great Fosters. But even Great\r\nFosters, with all the charm of its gables, its chimneys and its\r\nmullioned windows, does not stand in quite such sharp contrast to the\r\ngarishness of the Holloway buildings as the little village of Thorpe\r\nitself. Thorpe has been little written about. It lacks its sacred bard.\r\nBut neither Shere, nor Gomshall, nor Thursley, nor Chiddingfold, which\r\nhave been compared and criticised as the most beautiful of all Surrey\r\nvillages, can surpass Thorpe for richness of peace of ancient homes and\r\nquiet brooding over the past. Enter Thorpe from the north by the fields,\r\nand you will walk by lanes over which a hundred years have passed\r\nwithout adding a tile or a tree to cottages or cottage gardens; and in\r\nThorpe itself you can sit near the church on the edge of a stone stile,\r\nand look round at walls and roofs which might surely have sheltered Sir\r\nJohn Denham himself, walking by Thorpe to Chertsey. The stile stands\r\nacross an ancient right of way, which crosses the fields; a straight\r\nline from the churchyard to Chertsey. John de Rutherwyk, doubtless,\r\noften walked or rode that lonely byway; perhaps it was he who raised the\r\nlevel path dry and well-drained out of the swampy, snipe-haunted meadows\r\nthat lay between the little church and the great Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Thorpe._]\r\n\r\nSouth of Chertsey to the Wey is rather uninteresting country. Addlestone\r\nlies between Chertsey and Weybridge, though not in a direct line, and\r\nwas the home for years of two octogenarian authors, each of whom had a\r\npension from the State, and who between them wrote or edited over five\r\nhundred books--Samuel Carter Hall and his wife Anna Maria Fielding. Both\r\nare buried at Addlestone; so is Fanny Kemble's mother, Mrs. Charles\r\nKemble, who as Mademoiselle Decamp had delighted French theatres. But\r\nAddlestone's great possession is still living, the huge Crouch Oak which\r\nspreads vast branches over ground where Wycliff is said to have\r\npreached, and Queen Elizabeth to have dined. Once the Crouch Oak stood\r\nto mark the bounds of Windsor Forest; and up to years not long gone by\r\nlove-lorn young women gathered its bark to boil down into philtres to\r\nensnare the hearts of unwilling swains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Crouch Oak, Addlestone._]\r\n\r\nAt Anningsley Park, two miles away, lived Thomas Day, author of\r\n_Sandford and Merton_; Thomas Day, who took a foundling child of\r\nthirteen and named her Sabrina, and educated her to be his wife--a\r\nposition which she, at an age to marry, refused. His fate was perverse\r\nto the end. He taught himself to dance, wooing another lady who spurned\r\nhim; and, teaching himself to ride, he was thrown and killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCHOBHAM AND BISLEY\r\n\r\n    Euclid in Surrey.--Chobham.--Bagshot Rhododendrons.--Vultures of the\r\n    Road.--The Golden Farmer.--Catching the Small-pox.--A contented\r\n    Family.--The Queen's Bon-graces.--A Gentle Hermit.--Prize\r\n    fights.--Bisley.--Donkeytown.--A wilful brook.\r\n\r\nHalf of north-west Surrey belongs to the soldiers. Chobham Common,\r\nBagshot Heath, Chobham Ridges, Bisley, Pirbright, York Town, and\r\nCamberley contain among them pretty nearly all the camps, colleges,\r\ntraining grounds, and rifle-ranges that do not belong to Aldershot over\r\nthe Hampshire border. The whole aspect of the country is military; rural\r\noutlandishness has been drilled into rigidity and pattern. The roads run\r\nas straight as if the Romans had driven them--and, indeed, some of them\r\nin the neighbourhood are Roman roads; the face of the hills and heather\r\ncommons is scored with roads like figures of Euclid, triangles, oblongs,\r\nradii, rhomboids, every kind of road which enables you to go from one\r\nplace to another in the shortest space of time possible; which, for that\r\nmatter, is a thing you frequently wish to do. Nobody wants to linger on\r\na road as straight as a gunshot.\r\n\r\nCamberley, perhaps, is as good a centre as any for exploring this part\r\nof Surrey; but the border of the county is intersected with such a\r\nnetwork of railways that it is easy to get to Bagshot or Camberley or\r\nFrimley from almost anywhere and to join the railway again where you\r\nplease. One of the best walks is from Chertsey over Chobham Common to\r\nWindlesham and Bagshot, and then over Chobham Ridges down into Frimley.\r\nBisley is most easily visited from the railway, as thousands visit\r\nit--or rather the rifle range--every July.\r\n\r\nChobham Common is at its best in July, when the heather is out. But it\r\nhas a day in May, under a hot sun, which is, in some ways, more\r\ndistinct. The scent and the glow of the heather belong to other Surrey\r\nhills; but Chobham Common has its own features of sandy hillocks topped\r\nby clumps of pines, which set an austere gauntness on the place unlike\r\nthe rolling flanks and ridges by Frensham and Hindhead. In May the\r\nheather is dark and dry; there are sparse patches of gorse scattered\r\nabout the slopes, and looking across at a group of pines edging the\r\nhorizon you sometimes get a setting of black, yellow, and blue, which\r\nbelongs peculiarly to this corner of Surrey. Chobham Common and its\r\nheather have often been compared to Scotland, and I can never catch the\r\nlikeness. The heather is there, and the scattered pines like some of the\r\nLowlands; but the wind is a southern wind, and never blows like\r\nStevenson's wind on the moors \"as it blows in a ship's rigging, hard and\r\ncold and pure.\" Beyond all, there is nowhere the Scottish horizon of\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nWindlesham lies on the western edge of the Common, and straggles over a\r\ndozen short, crooked roads--an oasis among parallelograms. Once it had a\r\nreputation for growing bog-myrtle, as you may learn from Aubrey:--\r\n\r\n    \"In this Parish, at Light-Water-Moor, grows great store of a plant,\r\n    about a foot and a half high, called by the inhabitants Gole, but\r\n    the true Name is Gale; it has a very grateful smell, like a Mixture\r\n    of Bays and Myrtle, and in Latin it is called Myrtus Brabantica; it\r\n    grows also in several places of this healthy Country, and is used to\r\n    be put in their Chests among their Linnen.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may still be put there. Such a plant must have been a\r\nfavourite with an excellent housewife buried in the churchyard, whose\r\nepitaph attracts wandering readers:--\r\n\r\n    She was, but words are wanting to say \"What,\"\r\n    Think what a wife should be, and she was \"That.\"\r\n\r\nIf Aubrey were making another perambulation of Surrey to-day, he would\r\nforget the Windlesham bog-myrtle when he had seen the Bagshot\r\nrhododendrons. To imagine Bagshot without rhododendrons is to think of\r\nMitcham without lavender, Epsom without salts, Farnham without hops. The\r\nother name that goes naturally with rhododendrons is Waterer, and the\r\nWaterer nurseries have the magic of gardens of fairy tales. Even in\r\nwinter, on a sunny day, an Italian air blows through those tall thuias\r\nand cypresses, down those dark aisles of shining green. But in May and\r\nJune, when the rhododendrons glow from pearl to crimson, and the azaleas\r\nlight long stretches of flaming chrome and orange, the gardens take a\r\nglory that belongs to no other flowers.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the stage-coach Bagshot was a thriving village with an\r\ninn, perhaps the King's Arms of to-day, where thirty coaches a day\r\nchanged horses. That rich traffic drew the vultures of the road, and\r\nBagshot Heath was one of the most dreaded stretches of highway in\r\nEngland. Dick Turpin is said to have used the King's Arms and the Golden\r\nFarmer further down the road; it was the Golden Farmer in his day, and\r\nan unimaginative age has turned the farmer from Golden into Jolly. It is\r\na pity, for \"Jolly Farmer\" means no more than White Lion or a dozen\r\nother names, but to \"Golden Farmer\" there belongs a story. There was a\r\nhighwayman of Bagshot Heath who never would rob a purse of banknotes; he\r\nwould touch nothing but gold. At Frimley at the same time lived a\r\nfarmer, who never paid his debts in anything but gold. The golden farmer\r\none day was recognised as the golden highwayman, and the inn stands\r\nclose by the spot where they hanged him in chains.\r\n\r\nBagshot has had dealings with Stuart and other princes hunting the deer\r\nand putting up at the inns. Both the Charleses used to hunt in Bagshot\r\nPark. Once there was a pretty princes' quarrel. It was at one of the\r\nBagshot inns that the Duke of Buckingham, at the height of his wild\r\ncareer, had the coolness to turn Prince Rupert's horses out of the\r\nstables and put in his own. Rupert complained to the King, and the Duke\r\nof York backed him; but Charles decided for Buckingham. Twenty years or\r\nso later, John Evelyn was at a Bagshot inn with Pepys, and went to call\r\non a Mrs. Graham at her house in Bagshot Park. It was \"very commodious\r\nand well-furnished, as she was an excellent housewife, a prudent and\r\nvirtuous lady.\" She begged him to stay to dinner and sleep the night;\r\nshe told him all about her children--how the eldest was ill with the\r\nsmall-pox but going on pretty well, and the others running about among\r\ninfected people so as to catch the disease and get it over while they\r\nwere young. Evelyn quite approved; he had had small-pox in his own\r\nfamily, and knew something about it.\r\n\r\nThe house in Bagshot Park was made even more commodious some forty years\r\nago, as a residence for the Duke of Connaught.\r\n\r\nIn the Ordnance Maps, Bagshot Heath is placed south of Bagshot; in the\r\nold maps of the county, the Heath lies to the north and north-east, and\r\nwould merge into what is now Chobham Common. It must have covered many\r\nmore miles than the maps allow it to-day. Chobham Ridges stretch from\r\nits south-west corner, a long, sandy scar of three miles, overlooking\r\nthe Bisley rifle ranges and the desert ground behind them. You are sure\r\nto be invited to admire Chobham Ridges, and no doubt twenty years ago it\r\nwas fine wild country. But frequent notice-boards observing that when\r\nthe red flag is flying it is dangerous to walk any further, barbed wire,\r\nexcavations of gravel, and sand trampled by cavalry horses into a paste\r\nlike wet coaldust may temper the warmest enthusiasm. A hideous\r\nforeground can do something to spoil even a fine view, and the view from\r\nthe Ridges is certainly wide and wild. The finest view I have had from\r\nChobham Ridges was a thunderstorm driving down over Brookwood. It was a\r\ngusty, rainy day, and the rolling white and grey clouds and the lines of\r\ndriven hail rode down the sky like a charge.\r\n\r\nI once met, on Chobham Ridges, a pleasantly contented family. In front\r\nof a sort of bivouac of bent poles covered with cloths sat an old,\r\nweatherbeaten man, tailor-fashion, making a straw beehive. Another\r\nbeehive, finished, with a straw handle, lay at his side. A wood fire\r\nsmoked and sputtered a yard or two away; on a flat wooden barrow near\r\nwere rough cooking utensils and a dark tabby cat; two small boys, one of\r\nthem with not much more on him than a large pair of trousers, brought\r\nwood and bracken for the fire. It was raining, but I was wished good\r\nafternoon with the utmost cheerfulness. Were those his boys? They were;\r\nthey generally went with him. Was there a good sale for beehives round\r\nthere? There was a pretty good sale; this one, with a handle, he should\r\ntry to sell for two shillings; he might have to take less; a farmer let\r\nhim have the straw. Yes, he was known about there. That was the boys'\r\ncat; it generally went with them. What was that noise in the tent? That\r\nwas a pair of kittens; yes, the boys liked to have them; they generally\r\nhad kittens. One of them picked up the cat, upside down, with obvious\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nChobham itself lies five or six miles away from Chobham Ridges, south by\r\na mile even from Chobham Common. Long before you come into the village\r\nyou catch sight of the church spire, with its lead covering washed by\r\nthe rain to a brilliant whiteness. Rising above the red tiles of the\r\nvillage into a blue sky it looks as if it had been painted yesterday.\r\nThe church has been largely rebuilt, but has some fine Norman pillars,\r\nand contains besides the tomb of the great Nicholas Heath, once\r\nArchbishop of York. He was Lord Chancellor of England under Queen Mary,\r\nand a sound Papist. When Elizabeth came to the throne he resigned, but\r\nremained \"so much in the Queen's Bon-graces,\" as an old writer puts it,\r\n\"that she visited him once a Year through his Life, believing his\r\nmistaken Piety sincere.\"\r\n\r\nTwo miles behind the Ridges is Frimley, with an old inn and a church to\r\nwhich Americans come often. Bret Harte lived his last years at a house\r\non the hillside near, and is buried in the churchyard. But the Bret\r\nHarte of _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ and _The Heathen Chinee_ does not,\r\nof course, belong to Frimley; those were earlier successes which he\r\nnever equalled later.\r\n\r\nThe village politician ought to flourish at Frimley. On a board near the\r\nchurch I found a warning against a crime which must be becoming rarer.\r\n\"Notice is hereby given that any person or persons found damaging the\r\nparish pump will be prosecuted,\" it ran, but the pump I did not find.\r\n\r\nIn Aubrey's day, Frimley had the gentlest of hermits. He fled from the\r\nchanges and chances of the Parliamentary wars, and led the simplest\r\npossible life in the wilds. Aubrey describes his cottage:\r\n\r\n    \"At the end of this Hundred, I must not forget my noble friend, Mr.\r\n    Charles Howard's Cottage of Retirement (which he called his Castle),\r\n    which lay in the middle of a vast Heathy Country, far from any Road\r\n    or Village in the _Hope_ of a healthy Mountain, where, in the\r\n    troublesome Times, he withdrew from the wicked World, and enjoyed\r\n    himself here, where he had only one Floor, his little Dining Room, a\r\n    Kitchen, a Chapel, and a Laboratory. His utensils were all of Wood\r\n    or Earth; near him were about half a Dozen Cottages more, on whom he\r\n    shew'd much compassion and Charity.\"\r\n\r\nFrimley is a convenient stopping-place at which to join the railway. A\r\nwalk for another two miles or so would bring the curious in the history\r\nof the prize ring, if any still remain, to a classic spot on the\r\nHampshire border. It was in a meadow half a mile from Farnborough\r\nstation, selected because it would be easy to step out of one county\r\ninto the next and so avoid the police, that Tom Sayers fought the huge\r\nAmerican-Irishman Heenan, in almost the last great prize-fight fought in\r\nEngland. The fight came off on April 17, 1860; the most extraordinary\r\ncare had been taken to keep the secret of the place of meeting, and the\r\naccounts of the proceedings, when one remembers that it all took place\r\nin the mid-Victorian quiet which was producing the _Idylls of the King_\r\nand _Adam Bede_ are nearly unbelievable. Two monster trains carried\r\ntwelve hundred spectators, peers, members of Parliament, magistrates,\r\nofficers, clergymen, and gentlemen from London Bridge at dawn. Three\r\npounds each was the price of the tickets. Nobody except two or three in\r\nthe secret knew till that morning where the fight would be; the police,\r\nmounted and on foot, lined the railway from London Bridge for sixteen\r\nmiles, all armed with cutlasses. The trains \"turned off,\" as the account\r\nin _Bell's Life in London_ puts it, at Reigate, took water near\r\nGuildford, and ran into Farnborough station \"after a most pleasant\r\njourney through one of the prettiest countries in England, which,\r\nillumined by a glorious sun, and shooting forth in vernal beauty, must\r\nhave inspired all with intense gratification.\" Thus _Bell's_ eloquent\r\nreporter. Thirty-seven rounds were fought, in most of which Sayers was\r\nknocked down; his right arm was bruised and useless; Heenan could only\r\nsee out of one eye. They were stopped at last, and in a few minutes\r\nHeenan was blind. _Bell's Life_ next morning came out with a special\r\neight-page edition, the two centre pages twelve columns of tiny\r\nprint--nearly 30,000 words--describing every detail of the fight, the\r\nmen, and the history of boxing in general. There were some protests by\r\nsentimental people against the brutality of the thing, and _Bell_,\r\nprofessing a vigorous belief in this particular form of \"muscular\r\nChristianity,\" remarks reflectively that \"the whole country is not yet\r\nconverted to the right way on the subject of pugilism.\"\r\n\r\nBisley, which lies on the other side of Chobham Ridges, opposite to\r\nFrimley, is, as I have said, best reached by rail; indeed, there is\r\nlittle inducement to any one to reach it in any other way. Twenty years\r\nago Bisley was a tiny village. It is now a vast rifle range. The name\r\nhas become shifted from the little group of cottages and the quaint\r\nchurch standing among the cornfields half a mile away to the huge\r\ncommon enclosed by the National Rifle Association, where every year in\r\nJuly the great shooting prizes are won and lost. Bisley is in many ways\r\nunique. It carries on the traditions of Wimbledon, which were greater\r\nthan any other rifle meeting. It can show more targets and better ranges\r\nthan any other range; it attracts rifle-shots from every British\r\npossession on the face of the globe, and for a week the rain of bullets\r\nsent into the sandy banks behind the targets is almost ceaseless.\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable sight of the \"Bisley week\" is the second\r\nstage of the shooting for the King's Prize, when three hundred\r\ncompetitors are \"down\" at the same time opposite a hundred targets in a\r\nrow, and when the shooting is not over until 6,300 separate shots have\r\nbeen fired, signalled, and chalked on the blackboards by the\r\nrange-markers. But the great occasion is, of course, the final stage;\r\nwhen the winner is chaired and cheered, and asked the usual ridiculous\r\nquestions about smoking and drinking. Through all the week of the\r\nmeeting the camp is a gay sight, with its white tents and flaring\r\nbunting, and the pennons blowing all down the long ranges to measure the\r\nwind for prone riflemen. \"Lying prone on the back,\" by the way, is a\r\nphrase which creeps into many newspapers during Bisley week. It would\r\nclearly not do to speak of a \"supine\" rifle-shot.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the noise of a rifle-range would make the\r\nneighbourhood intolerable. But even with the wind blowing to you from\r\nthe range, a few hundred yards almost silences the sound of the range. I\r\nhave walked on the common between Bisley itself and the range, when\r\nfiring for the King's Prize was in full progress, and was merely\r\nconscious of an echo chattering uneasily in the trees.\r\n\r\nThere have been plenty of ways of spelling Bisley. Busele, Buselagh,\r\nBushley, Busheley, Busley, Bussley, Busly, and Bisleigh are a few of\r\nthem; there are probably variations. The church has a fine old wooden\r\nporch, with an old yew opposite it; but the door is locked, and visitors\r\nare not allowed to look over the church unaccompanied. My guide was\r\ncourteous and obliging; but why should any one be given all this\r\ntrouble? There is a famous well near, named after St. John the Baptist,\r\nthe water of which was once used for all the christenings. It is not\r\nvery easily found, and the local harvesters could tell me nothing about\r\nit; but I discovered it near a farmhouse a few hundred yards south-west\r\nof the churchyard. Aubrey says that the dedication of the well made him\r\ncurious to try it with oak-galls, which turned the water purple. Why\r\nshould the name have impelled him to this particular curiosity? Aubrey\r\nwas always testing wells with oak-galls, presumably for iron. Like many\r\nother famous wells, the water of this spring has always been said to be\r\n\"colder in summer and warmer in winter\" than any other spring in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSome of the names in this part of Surrey are curious. Cuckoo Hill, on\r\nthe borders of Bagshot Heath, is pretty enough, and so is Gracious Pond,\r\nnorth-west of Chobham, though the Pond, which was once \"great\" and\r\n\"stocked with excellent carp,\" is probably much smaller than it was.\r\nBrock Hill, near Cuckoo Hill, is of course the hill of badgers, and\r\nPenny Pot ought to be, if it is not, a memory of good ale. But\r\nDonkeytown! Who would live at Donkeytown? It is, however, quite a\r\nflourishing little community, though probably it will be eventually\r\nembraced by its larger neighbour, West End, which is the nearest village\r\nto Bisley to the north, and the largest. Looking at the map, it is a\r\nlittle difficult to understand why the cheaper forms of village building\r\nshould spread in this part of the county, which, so to speak, leads\r\nnowhere: but possibly the presence of the Gordon Boys' Home has created\r\nfresh needs which must be supplied locally. The large buildings, which\r\ncost some L24,000, were set up here in 1885, and are a home for 200\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nBetween Bisley and Chobham runs a road with rather an odd feature. For a\r\nshort distance near Chobham village the little Hale Bourne, into which\r\nthe Windle Brook has here grown, runs beside it, dark and full, but\r\nalmost invisible under its overarching alders and dog-roses. Just as it\r\nleaves the roadside it is joined by a strange companion. Another little\r\nstream, coming down from the north, runs into the Hale Bourne after\r\ntravelling the last hundred yards of its course over the whole breadth\r\nof a road. The road, which is of gravel, and regularly used, is hard and\r\nlevel, and the stream turns it into a bed, perhaps eight or nine feet\r\nacross. The natural course would seem to be to dig the stream a bed of\r\nits own by the side of the road; but local ingenuity has preferred to\r\nsend the traveller dryshod over a stile through the field at the side of\r\nthe stream, which duly proceeds in the Ordnance map down the road it has\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Horsell Church._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE WEY VILLAGES\r\n\r\n    Old Woking.--Behind the Veil.--A Royal Palace.--Necropolis.--When\r\n    not to dig a grave.--\"Lumpy\" Stevens.--The Ripley Road.--The Anchor\r\n    and the Talbot Dog.--An Open Box.--Teal by Twilight.--Ockham.--Seven\r\n    Streams.--Newark.--Jackdaws two shillings the Dozen.--The Wisley\r\n    Garden.--Byfleet.--A Ghost in Velvet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn whatever way you may choose to travel through Surrey, it is difficult\r\nto avoid making Woking a centre and a rendezvous. All the trains stop\r\nthere; at least, I cannot remember ever passing through the station\r\nwithout stopping, either to change trains, which generally takes three\r\nquarters of an hour, or to wait in the station until it is time to go on\r\nagain, which usually takes eleven minutes. I never found anything else\r\nto do at Woking, unless it were at night, when the railway lights up\r\nwonderful vistas and avenues of coloured lamps. Then the platform can be\r\ntolerable. Once when I had a long time to wait I walked out to the\r\nchurch which stands rather finely on the ridge north of the railway. I\r\nthought then it was Woking church: it belongs to Horsell. It was that\r\nWoking, the Woking of the station, which for many years I imagined to be\r\nthe only Woking in Surrey. One did not wish for another.\r\n\r\nBut there is another Woking, and it is as pretty and quiet as the\r\nrailway Woking is noisy and tiresome. It stands with its old church on\r\nthe banks of the Wey two miles away, a huddle of tiled roofs and old\r\nshops and poky little corners, as out-of-the-way and sleepy and\r\nill-served by rail as anyone could wish. I found it first on a day in\r\nOctober, and walked out from the grinding machinery of the station by a\r\nfield-path running through broad acres of purple-brown loam, over which\r\nplough-horses tramped and turned. It was a strange and arresting sight,\r\nfor over the dark rich mould there was drawn a veil of shimmering grey\r\nlight wider and less earthly than any mist or dew. The whole plough land\r\nwas alive with gossamer; and Old Woking lay beyond the gossamer as if\r\nthat magic veil were meant to shield it from the engines and the smoke.\r\n\r\nOld Woking, indeed, lies in country deep enough to forget the railway\r\naltogether, and to take to the water as the highway. The Wey wanders in\r\nand out by the village, and half-a-mile away at Send the Navigation\r\ncanal joins the Wey proper, as the little river has come to be called to\r\ndistinguish it from the canal. The canal cuts businesslike corners and\r\nstraight lines when the Wey, having plenty of time to spare, wants to\r\nwander an extra two or three miles about a field. From Send to Weybridge\r\nor to Guildford, down stream or up, by the canal towing-path or by boat,\r\nis a delightful journey in spring or summer. As good a round as can be\r\ntaken walking is from Woking through Send by Newark Priory, Pyrford and\r\nWisley to Byfleet, where the railway can be joined or the journey\r\ncontinued to Weybridge or back to Woking. But there are, of course,\r\ntwenty ways of seeing the little villages that cluster round the Wey so\r\nclosely in this corner of Surrey, either on foot or by boat, or rowing\r\nand walking both.\r\n\r\nBut Woking has not always been quiet and old-fashioned and sleepy. Once\r\nit was a royal manor, and contained a royal residence. William the\r\nConqueror held Woking in demesne himself, and it passed through the\r\nhands of every king until James I, who gave it to one of his foresters,\r\nSir Edward Zouch. Sir Edward had to pay something for his privilege. He\r\nheld the manor on condition that he was to bring to the king's table, on\r\nthe Feast of St. James each year, the first dish at dinner, and with the\r\ndish the satisfactorily large rent of a hundred pounds in coined gold of\r\nthe realm. Perhaps he still made something out of his tenants; at all\r\nevents, a further token of gratitude, he was to wind a call in Woking\r\nForest on Coronation Day. He may have liked the rental, but he could not\r\nhave liked the old palace, for he knocked down every brick of it. The\r\nstrangest and most melancholy fate seems to wait on every palace in\r\nSurrey built or lived in by an English king,--even by the friend of a\r\nking. Of Oatlands, Guildford, Woking, Nonsuch, Sheen, each a king's\r\npalace, scarcely a stone remains; Wolsey's palace by the Mole is nothing\r\nbut a gateway; the Archbishops' palace at Croydon has sunk as low as a\r\nwash-house. Kingston owns the stone on which English kings have been\r\ncrowned; but elsewhere in Surrey the royal hand has touched only to\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nA persistent association hangs to the name of the town by the station,\r\nundeserved but traditional. Woking, like the Duke of Plaza-toro, \"likes\r\nan interment.\" Much of the land near the town is owned by a company\r\nwhich, while it builds villas for the living, especially those who find\r\nadvantages in a fast train service, has named itself Necropolis, which\r\nis grim enough for anybody living or dead. But the Necropolis Company,\r\nwhether it knows it or not, did not found the tradition. That stands to\r\nthe record of an old grave-digger interviewed by Aubrey. He conversed\r\ngrimly and with authority on the places and seasons for the proper\r\ndigging of graves. He \"had a rule from his father to know when not to\r\ndig a grave.\" That was \"when he found a certain plant about the bigness\r\nof the middle of a tobacco-pipe, which came near the surface of the\r\nearth, but never above it. It is very tough, and about a yard long; the\r\nrind of it is almost black, and tender, so that when you pluck it, it\r\nslips off and underneath is red; it hath a small button at the top, not\r\nmuch unlike the top of an asparagus; of these he sometimes finds two or\r\nthree in a grave.\" He was \"sure it was not a fern-root\" and had with\r\ndiligence traced to its root; and since he had satisfied himself of its\r\ngrisly origin, he knew better than to dig a grave near where the root\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View from the Bridge, Woking._]\r\n\r\nOn the maps Send looks like a single tiny village, south of Woking by\r\nhalf a mile. It is in reality a large parish, and since the name is\r\ncorrupted simply from Sand, it is natural enough to find it dotted all\r\nround the neighbourhood with other names tacked on to it--Sendholme,\r\nSendgrove, Sendhurst, Send Heath, and Sendmarsh. The names are scattered\r\nonly less widely than the parish itself. The church stands a mile from\r\nthe little hamlet of Send, on the banks of the Wey, like the churches of\r\nPyrford and Woking, and the ruins of the great Priory of Newark, to\r\nwhich Send Church and her chapel at Ripley both belonged. The three\r\nvillages with their churches are still, perhaps, not much larger than\r\nthey were two or three hundred years ago; the Priory is shattered; only\r\nthe village with the chapel has grown.\r\n\r\nBy Send churchyard stands the bole of a mighty elm, riven and\r\niron-bound. I like to imagine that it may have been climbed by one of\r\nthe great Surrey cricketers of the old days of the Hambledon Club.\r\nEdward Stevens, the famous \"Lumpy,\" was born at Send, and spent his\r\nboyhood there till he went to Chertsey and became, as John Nyren\r\ndescribes him, one of the two greatest bowlers he ever saw. \"Lumpy\" got\r\nhis queer name either because he was, in Nyren's words, \"a short man,\r\nround-shouldered and stout\" or, according to another tradition, because\r\nat one of the dinners of the Hambledon Club he ate an apple-pie whole.\r\nSurely he must have been \"Lumpy\" before, besides after, that\r\nachievement. Yet another story has it that he was given his name because\r\nof some trick in his bowling. Certainly his methods were not what we\r\nshould call exactly orthodox to-day. It was the privilege of visiting\r\nelevens in his day to choose the pitch on which the match should be\r\nplayed, and that was \"Lumpy's\" opportunity. Nyren explains his plan:--\r\n\r\n    \"He would invariably choose the ground where his balls would\r\n    _shoot_, instead of selecting a rising spot to bowl against, which\r\n    would materially have increased the difficulty to the hitter, seeing\r\n    that so many more would be caught out by the mounting of the ball.\r\n    As, however, nothing delighted the old man like bowling the wicket\r\n    down with a shooting ball, he would sacrifice the other chances to\r\n    the glory of that achievement. Many a time have I seen our General\r\n    twig this prejudice in the old man when matched against us, and\r\n    chuckle at it. But I believe it was almost the only mistake he ever\r\n    made, professional or even moral, for he was a most simple and\r\n    amiable creature.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an unkind legend which speaks of \"Lumpy\" as a bit of a smuggler\r\nin his young days, but Nyren, at all events, never believed it, for he\r\nends by declaring handsomely that \"he had no trick about him, but was\r\nas plain as a pike-staff in all his dealings.\" \"Lumpy,\" whether he\r\nsmuggled or not, certainly has his niche in cricket history. It was to\r\nhim that the wicket owes its third stump. In a match played in 1775 on\r\nthe Portsmouth Artillery Ground, between five of the Hambledon Club and\r\nfive of All England, \"Lumpy\" three times sent the ball between the last\r\nHambledon man's stumps without bowling him, and after the match, which\r\nHambledon won in consequence, the number of the stumps was increased\r\nfrom two to three.\r\n\r\nSend lies deep among the fields, counting itself fortunate, perhaps,\r\nthat it is not on the Ripley road, a mile away. Ripley itself, perhaps,\r\nowes its fortune, even if it owes more besides, to the road which it has\r\nnamed. The story belongs to all the villages of a great highway. The\r\ncoaches brought their heyday, the railway spoiled it, the bicycle\r\nre-made it, and now the village is being re-decorated by the motor-car.\r\n\r\nThe Ripley road, for the two days in the week when it is most used, is a\r\nplace to avoid. Yet it can be beautiful, and there is an approach to it\r\nhardly equalled near any other highway in the county. The late Mrs.\r\nBuxton, of Foxwarren Park, above Wisley Common, for years permitted the\r\npublic to walk and drive through her private grounds away from the high\r\nroad, and that generous lady's permission has been continued by her\r\nsuccessor. The carriage drive runs by oaks and bracken through which\r\npheasants rustle, past a strange, tall column of black wood--a\r\ntotem-pole brought from Queen Charlotte's Islands; then it rises to the\r\nedge of a ridge overlooking a wide and level stretch of pinewood and\r\nheather. In August, when the ling is out with the bell-heather, and the\r\npines stand deep in fern and rushes, no lovelier carpet spreads under\r\nany Surrey hill. The road runs a white thread through it--a road best\r\nviewed from afar. The weight of wheels has ground the surface to powder.\r\n\r\nRipley itself, but for the traffic, would be the prettiest village on\r\nthe road. A long string of low-roofed houses lines the highway; little\r\nwhite gabled cottages offer tea and refreshment; two old inns share\r\nmost, I suppose, of the custom of fasting travellers. The Anchor, an inn\r\nof many gables, has fixed itself in the affections of bicyclists since\r\nthe days when they rode velocipedes, and its black-beamed walls and\r\npassages hold drawings of strange souls mounted on wheels which would\r\nhave scared Ixion. The Talbot, which was once the Dog (but a talbot is a\r\ndog always), is a house of imposing squareness. You may see the dog\r\npainted above the door, a liver-and-white fox-terrier, all proper.\r\nOpposite the inns stretches Ripley green, a broad and shining level with\r\nmany memories of Surrey cricket, and in particular of \"Lumpy\" Stevens,\r\nof Send.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Village Street, Ripley._]\r\n\r\nThe motor-car has brought prosperity, even if it is a prosperity that\r\ncan soil. But the tarnish washes off in night and rain. Ripley may look\r\nits best early on a Saturday morning, before the flood rushes down the\r\nroad. When the little village lies clean and fresh in the sun, and the\r\ninns are busy with white tablecloths and cooking potatoes, and the\r\nchildren sit on the edge of the green before the dust comes, there is a\r\nsense of orderly bustle and of waiting for a day of hard work and good\r\nmoney that is pleasant enough.\r\n\r\nOne building only has suffered from the business of the road. The little\r\nchurch stands behind arches and canopies of clipped yew, its walls\r\nalmost touching the highway. It is an interesting little building,\r\nthough much altered from its oldest form; the chancel has the remains of\r\nclustered pillars, and a beautiful string-course of Caen stone running\r\nround it. But those have not been the only attractions to visitors. When\r\nI was there I noticed that the oak collection-box by the door stood with\r\nits lid propped open. The caretaker happened to be in the church, and I\r\nshowed it to her. \"Oh yes,\" she said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"we have\r\nto keep it like that. It has been robbed so often that we prop it open,\r\nso as to prevent people putting anything in.\" The church door still\r\nremains as wide open as the box. It would be a pious act for some\r\npassing motor-car--or a collection from many--to present the little\r\nchurch with a stronger box. Such continued hospitality, so vilely\r\nabused, deserves a return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trees on the Green, Ripley._]\r\n\r\nTwo miles up the road lies the Hut Pond, opposite an inn that serves\r\nmany tables. There is no quiet on the pond in the business of the day,\r\nbut I was once on it on an October evening, and as the sun went down the\r\nsky filled suddenly with teal. Bunches of teal wheeled and circled in\r\nthe cold twilight, whizzed down among the rushes, darted up again and\r\nround over the pines, then shot down again and settled, splashing\r\nquietly in the sedge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Priest's door and Norman Chancel Ripley Church._]\r\n\r\nOckham village, with its church and park, is south-east of Ripley by a\r\nmile or so. The charm of Ockham church lies in its tower, its east\r\nwindow, and its deep and happy site among the oaks and elms of Ockham\r\nPark. The church lies some hundred yards from the road, under the\r\nwindows of the manor-house, a building which cannot be said to owe\r\nanything to the taste or consistency of successive architects. The\r\ntower is thirteenth century, buttressed, mottled into cool greys and\r\npinks, and heavy with ivy. But the chief decoration of Ockham Church is\r\nits thirteenth century, seven-lancet east window, and in the carving of\r\nthe capitals of its slender columns of black Sussex marble. There is\r\nsome quaint Flemish glass in one of the south windows; but the church is\r\nspoiled by an extraordinarily ugly little chapel built on the north side\r\nas a mausoleum for the family of the Kings. The first of the line of\r\nthese Kings was one Peter, the son of an Exeter grocer. He came up to\r\nLondon, soon made his mark as a lawyer, and died Lord Chancellor. There\r\nare several of his descendants buried with him, and their coronets hang\r\nabove the arch of the chapel. They add a peculiar tawdriness; but the\r\nchapel itself, with its dull blue paint, and the strange, bath-like\r\nsarcophagus below Rysbrach's statues of the first Lord King and his\r\nlady, is the main offence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ockham Church._]\r\n\r\nOckham itself, even with that humming white highway not a mile distant,\r\nis untouched and unspoiled: nothing more than a half-dozen or so of\r\nhalf-timbered or brick cottages and farm-buildings, rain-bleached and\r\ncreeper-veiled, and fronted with some of the prettiest and brightest\r\ngardens in Surrey. One of the sleepy little buildings bears the legend\r\n\"County Police,\" forbidding in new blue enamel. What should anyone do\r\nwith police in Ockham?\r\n\r\nBut Ockham, perhaps, lies a little too far from the old waterway to join\r\nthe group of villages and churches which cluster along this winding\r\nstretch of Wey. Still it belongs to Ripley, if not to Ripley's group\r\nalong the river. Rivers, here, would be the better word, for the Wey has\r\nhardly yet made up its mind as to its right channel north of Woking, and\r\nby Ripley runs actually in seven streams almost parallel with one\r\nanother, some of them cut artificially, but others tiny remnants of the\r\nbroad watercourse which once rolled through Surrey to the sea. No doubt\r\nit was this abundance of water which first attracted the founder of\r\nNewark Priory, whose ruins stand almost in the centre of the seven\r\nstreams. The monks must have had plenty of choice of fishing.\r\n\r\nNewark Priory is generally supposed to have been founded as a house of\r\nBlack Canons by Ruald de Calva and his wife Beatrice de Sandes in the\r\nreign of Richard I. But Ruald de Calva as a fact only re-founded or\r\nendowed the house, which was founded long before, probably by a Bishop\r\nof Winchester. Its older name was Aldbury, and Newark--or Newsted, as it\r\nwas once called--which for us is an aged ruin, was Aldbury rebuilt with\r\na new church and a new name. It is in some ways a rather uninteresting\r\nruin. Of the tracery of the windows, or any of the lighter and more\r\ndelicate architectural work, not a stone remains. I believe much of the\r\nmore easily used stone-work found its way into the building of\r\nneighbouring houses, perhaps into the paving of the roads. But it has a\r\ncertain bluntness and gauntness of its own, standing solid and stark in\r\nthe plain meadowland of the Wey. Perhaps if one were to \"visit it by the\r\npale moonlight\" it would take on darker graces and dignities. As it is,\r\nthere is somewhere about it an air of protest; it is like a ghost that\r\ncannot get back before daylight. Horses gallop about the rough field\r\nunder its walls; boating parties wonder why it should be thought worth\r\nwhile to fence it off with wire. Once I caught an echo of the real\r\nNewark, late on a dark and stormy afternoon, when a sudden snipe rose at\r\nmy feet out of one of the half-dry Priory stewponds. That wild cry must\r\nhave been familiar enough to the old monks wandering by the stream in\r\nsearch of a likely run for perch or pike.\r\n\r\nThe \"very old castle\" which Frank Buckland, the naturalist, mentions in\r\nthe following note, taken from his edition of White's _Selborne_, must\r\nsurely be Newark Priory, which is now a happy (and I think unmolested)\r\nhome of jackdaws:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Newark Priory._]\r\n\r\n    \"At Whistley, near Weybridge, the people go in May, when the birds\r\n    are about a fortnight old, to the ruins of a very old castle. Men\r\n    carry long ladders, and with blunt iron hooks take out the young\r\n    jackdaws, and if there are no buyers they throw them to the ground.\r\n    Bird dealers take hampers down to Whistley and bring up all the\r\n    birds caught, as many as ten dozen of young jackdaws. They cost on\r\n    the spot 2s. per dozen. The reason why they are taken is to stop the\r\n    increase of jackdaws in the neighbourhood. If the young jackdaws are\r\n    taken when about a fortnight old, the old ones will not 'go to nest'\r\n    again that season. If the eggs only were taken, the birds would lay\r\n    again immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe Canal and the Wey by Newark lie in some of the quietest and wildest\r\ncountry in Surrey. It is not the wildness of Thursley Common, or the\r\nquiet of the pinewoods; but it is the sunny peace of a waterway almost\r\ndeserted, of unploughed, rushy meadows, of waterside paths and thickets\r\nthat fill in April and May with a tide of bird life which stays here,\r\nand elsewhere passes or is hardly seen. A May morning on the Wey Canal\r\nrings with singing. You can count scores of cuckoos gliding in the sun\r\nand calling from the budding branches; woodpeckers laugh from oak to\r\noak; plovers tumble in the wind; herons flap up lazily at a bend in the\r\nstream, and flap lazily down again; snipe cut high arcs in the blue and\r\ndrum down from the sailing clouds; perhaps from the very heart of the\r\nthicket the nightingale bursts into a pulsing riot of song. Surrey\r\nvaries extraordinarily widely as a shelter and a nesting ground for\r\nbirds, but most of its birds, I think, know the Wey Canal.\r\n\r\nOf the seven streams which surround Newark Abbey the northernmost runs\r\nunder the little hill on which stands Pyrford Church. Pyrford itself, on\r\nits outskirts, unhappily, is beginning to hear Woking. The Woking\r\nbuilder's hammer is already ringing under its trees. But the heart of\r\nPyrford hitherto remains untouched. A cluster of red-brick\r\nfarm-buildings, a footpath over meadows of buttercups, a score of\r\narching elms, and a little shingle-spired Norman church on a knoll above\r\nthe stream--Pyrford is one of the smallest and sweetest of Weyside\r\nvillages. Few churches have so strong an impression of an untouched\r\npast. In plan it is scarcely altered from its Norman design of the\r\ntwelfth century; and it stands on its knoll overlooking the meadows away\r\nto the great Priory of which it was a chapel, the Priory in ruins, and\r\nitself with hardly a stone loosened for nearly eight centuries. The roof\r\nis later than the walls, but there is a fascination in staring up at the\r\nold oak timber. It was the same vista of retreating beams of mighty wood\r\non which the eye of the Newark priest droning from the altar must have\r\nrested; perhaps for his sleepy congregation there was the same glimpse\r\nof ivy tendrils creeping in under the eaves, and on drowsy afternoons in\r\nMay the same chatter and hiss of nesting starlings. From the scanty\r\nscraps of the paintings on the wall you can only guess vaguely at the\r\ntexts of the old Sunday sermons: manna falls in the wilderness; Moses\r\nbrings water out of the rock; probably the congregation listened with\r\nmost eagerness to the third, the death of Jezebel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mill on the Wey, between Pyrford and Ripley._]\r\n\r\nDonne, the poet, perhaps knew the paintings well. In the days when he\r\nwas still unforgiven by Sir George More of Loseley for having run away\r\nwith his daughter Anne, he and his bride lived for some years as the\r\nguests of Sir John Wolley, Queen Elizabeth's secretary, at Pyrford Park.\r\nMay it not have been the seven-streamed Wey by Pyrford which gave him\r\nhis stanzas for _The Bait_, his parody of Marlowe?\r\n\r\n    Come live with me, and be my love,\r\n    And we will some new pleasures prove\r\n    Of golden sands and crystal brooks,\r\n    With silken lines and silver hooks.\r\n\r\n    Let others freeze with angling reeds,\r\n    And cut their legs with shells and weeds,\r\n    Or treacherously poor fish beset\r\n    With strangling snare, or windowy net.\r\n\r\n    Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest\r\n    The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;\r\n    Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,\r\n    Bewitch poor fishes' wandering eyes.\r\n\r\n    For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,\r\n    For thou thyself art thine own bait;\r\n    That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,\r\n    Alas! is wiser far than I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pyrford Church._]\r\n\r\nTwo miles further down the Canal--perhaps nearly four by the Wey\r\nitself--stands another little church, almost, like Pyrford and Woking,\r\non the edge of the stream. Wisley church is the tiniest of the little\r\ngroup between Send and the Thames, but is not otherwise remarkable. The\r\nvillage is not much more than a farmhouse and a noble barn; perhaps\r\nWisley is better known for its pond and its garden. The garden,\r\nunhappily, is almost a thing of the past. Experiment and officialdom\r\nhave settled heavily on its sandy soil, and the wilder charm of the old\r\npleasance has left it. A few years ago, when its late owner, Mr. Wilson\r\nof Weybridge, was alive, it was a delight to many hundreds of visitors,\r\nwhom the owner generously allowed to share in his pleasure in rare and\r\nbeautiful flowers. He had collected into a few acres of ground,\r\nprotected by ingeniously laid out plantations, an almost incredible\r\nvariety of plants, especially flowering bulbs, and in his woods and\r\nponds, besides, had tried to establish other curious and interesting\r\nwild life. Bird-boxes fastened to the trees were to tempt tits and\r\nnuthatches; in the reeds of the ponds great bull-frogs used to squat\r\ncroaking, and little green frogs climbed the leaves above them. To-day\r\nthat is hardly more than a memory. When the owner died the garden was\r\nbought by Sir Thomas Hanbury and presented to the Royal Horticultural\r\nSociety. The society came down from Kew upon the fold; and on the open\r\nground beside the old garden, tangled and unhappy, set down a row of\r\nsuperb glasshouses, planted a number of specimen fruit trees, and\r\ndevoted itself forthwith to up-to-date research and education on the\r\nmost approved lines of modern scientific arboriculture and hybridisation\r\nin hothouses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wisley Church._]\r\n\r\nLast of the little bunch of Weyside churches is Byfleet, with a belfry\r\nbuilt on some magnificent oak beams. Byfleet Manor House used to be a\r\nroyal hunting lodge, and was given with the right of free warren by\r\nEdward II to Piers Gaveston. Its last royal owner was James the First's\r\nqueen, Anne of Denmark, and it was probably she who built the massive\r\nwalls and the forecourt of the garden of the present home. But the manor\r\nhouse itself is early Georgian; and though it has had some ugly\r\nadditions, it still stands square and strong behind its fine old\r\ngateway. James is supposed to have planted the Scotch firs in the\r\ngarden, to remind Queen Anne of the home she left behind her in the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nSuch a building would be sure to have some quaint traditions. It is\r\nknown locally as the King's House, and there is a legend that Henry VIII\r\nwas nursed there. He may have been, but not in the present building. It\r\nhas no regular ghosts, but Miss Frances Mitchell, writing on the history\r\nof the Manor in the _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, tells us that\r\nAnne of Denmark is said to have been seen moving through the lower\r\nrooms; and there is a very dim tradition of a dwarf in purple velvet who\r\nwanders in the forecourt. A third legend, in which the rustic historian\r\napparently confuses Anne of Denmark with the last Stuart Queen, relates\r\nthat Queen Anne came to Byfleet and from a neighbouring hill watched\r\nMarlborough win the battle of Blenheim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nRICHMOND AND KEW\r\n\r\n    The Woking of the Surrey Thames.--Peasants in the field.--Ham\r\n    House.--The Cabal.--Petersham.--Richmond Hill.--_The Heart of\r\n    Midlothian._--Deer in the sunlight.--Queen Elizabeth dying.--Kew\r\n    Palace.--The secret of the Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWoking is the centre to which it is difficult not to return in exploring\r\nthe Wey and the Wey villages: Surbiton is the centre of the roads about\r\nthe Surrey Thames. Surbiton has tramways besides a railway, and Surbiton\r\nstation is perhaps the most convenient starting point either for Hampton\r\nCourt on the Middlesex bank, or for Kingston, or through Kingston to Ham\r\nand Richmond and Kew. Kingston, in one direction, has its own chapter;\r\nso have the Dittons and Walton in another; beyond Kingston lies a walk\r\n(not often taken, perhaps), along the river bank to Ham and Petersham; a\r\nwalk that leads to Richmond Park and its deer dozing among the bracken\r\nin the afternoon sun, and Kew Gardens waiting in the evening--the best\r\nhour of all the day among those ordered flowers and trees.\r\n\r\nI never saw Ham until one day, walking out from Kingston, I suddenly\r\nfound myself in the fruitful spaces of market gardens and farms. It is\r\nthe suddenest change. Kingston, with the oldest memories of all Surrey\r\ntowns, is as new and noisy as a thoroughly efficient service of tramways\r\ncan make it; and then, within a stone's throw of bricks and barracks,\r\nyou come upon acres beyond acres of level farmland, bean-fields and\r\ncabbage-fields and all the pleasantness of tilled soil and trenched\r\nearth and the wealth of kindly fruits. When I saw the fields by Ham on a\r\nhot day in August there were country women gathering runner beans into\r\ncoarse aprons, stooping over the clustered plants, the humblest and\r\nhardiest of workers of the farm. Under that hot sun, in the wide spaces\r\nof those unfenced fields, with no English hedge to shut off neighbouring\r\ncrops and tillage, the air of those bent, lowly figures was of French\r\npeasantry, French nearness to the difficult livelihood of the soil. They\r\nmight have gleaned for Millet; they should cease their work at the\r\nAngelus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Richmond Bridge._]\r\n\r\nTeddington Lock, a mile down stream from Kingston suburbs, joins Surrey\r\nto Middlesex and the tide to the tideless river with a vast piece of\r\nengineering. Further down, Eel Pie island breaks the stream, a bunch of\r\nchairs, tables and trees, where, for all I know, others may still eat\r\nand praise eel pie. But the fascination of this stretch of river is on\r\nthe Surrey bank, where Ham House stands among noble trees. Ham House is\r\nnot a \"show house\"; and indeed, considering its nearness to Richmond and\r\nLondon, it would be impossible that it should be. There are limits to\r\nthe claims which may be made upon owners of historic houses who may also\r\nwish to live in them. But Ham House holds other magnets than its\r\npictures and relics of Stuarts and Lauderdales. The guide-books\r\ncatalogue the pictures, and perhaps I need not copy the catalogues. The\r\nreal fascination is Ham House with its history, the meeting-place of the\r\ngreat Cabal. But you may see that Ham House from a distance; the house\r\nas the Duke of Lauderdale saw it from the river bank, or driving to the\r\ndoor to join his fellow Ministers; the garden front, with its statue of\r\nFather Thames, the statue at which Buckingham and Arlington used to\r\nstare, perhaps, wondering how much longer their sinister power would be\r\nleft to them. All that they knew and saw day by day remains--the dull\r\nred brick, the wrought iron gate, the quaint statuary of the walls; and\r\nround the garden walls and shading the wide lawn behind the house, the\r\ntrees as later, gentler souls saw them; Thomson, walking from his\r\nRichmond cottage, and Hood, strolling under the long avenue of elms.\r\n\r\nPetersham has riverside houses which would dignify Georgian aldermen;\r\nsquare red houses set about with wistaria and high garden walls, worthy\r\nto be neighbours of Richmond Park; worthy, too, of a handsomer neighbour\r\nthan Petersham church, an insignificant little building which yet was\r\nthought sufficient for the dust of the Duchess of Lauderdale. Outside in\r\nthe churchyard lies the sailor who sought for the North-west passage and\r\nnamed Vancouver's Island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Thames from Richmond Hill._]\r\n\r\nOf Richmond Park, and the view from Richmond Terrace, and the departed\r\nglories of Richmond's palace which was the palace of Sheen, what should\r\nbe said? How should the beauty of the view from the Terrace be measured?\r\nScott has set it in the pages of _The Heart of Midlothian_, and Scott,\r\nperhaps, thought it the loveliest and richest of English landscapes. It\r\nwas \"a huge sea of verdure, with crossing and intersecting promontories\r\nof massive and tufted groves.\" It was \"tenanted by numberless flocks and\r\nherds, which seemed to wander unrestrained and unbounded through the\r\nrich pastures. The Thames, here turreted with villas and there garlanded\r\nwith forests, moved on slowly and placidly, like the mighty monarch of\r\nthe scene, to whom all its other beauties were but accessories, and bore\r\non its bosom an hundred barks and skiffs, whose white sails and gaily\r\nfluttering pennons gave life to the whole.\" That was the scene which was\r\nshown to Jeanie Deans, arrived at Richmond to sue for pardon for her\r\nsister, by the Duke of Argyle. \"We have nothing like it in Scotland,\"\r\nsaid the Duke of Argyle. Is that the secret? Is it because it is all\r\nthat is typical of south country greenness and the peace of broad water\r\nand deep woodlands that it made its appeal to the Scot used to grey\r\ncrags and barren moorland? Or is its chief appeal not to the Scot but to\r\nthe Londoner, and does the Londoner praise Sir Walter's taste because\r\nSir Walter has praised his? That is part of the story of the beauty of\r\nthe Richmond view, perhaps. It is so easily found from London. It has\r\nall that the Londoner loves to look at. It is the country as he wishes\r\nto see it. A glorious stretch of luxuriant woodland, a noble breadth of\r\nshining water, sunlight on wide meadows; but above all, setting a\r\ndifference between this orderly beauty and the wild splendours of some\r\nwestern or northern moorland valley, the presence of befriending,\r\ncomrade man. The boats, the sails, the swans, the water flashing on the\r\noars; the neighbouring roofs, the patterned flower gardens, the comforts\r\nof hotels at hand, the readiness with which it is all won and\r\nenjoyed--those are some of the secrets of the ideal. It is the country\r\nseen from an outdoor theatre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Palace Yard, Richmond._]\r\n\r\nRichmond Park itself would be worth visiting for any countryman because\r\nof its deer. Deer standing about in the bracken; deer asleep in thick\r\nfern under great oaks; deer feeding slowly up wind on a distant slope of\r\ngreen; deer leaping shadows of tree-stems one after another as if the\r\nshadows were water, which is one of the deer's prettiest games in the\r\nsun: deer trotting off as you try to come nearer to them, with that\r\ncurious quivering, shaking amble which is born of lissom daintiness and\r\nmuscles like steel; deer with hot sunlight on their coats--it is the\r\nRichmond Park deer which are the creatures to come and see. How many are\r\nthere? Who should count them? Sixteen hundred fallow deer and fifty red\r\ndeer, the figures are given; Farnham Park, I think, comes next in\r\nSurrey, with three hundred fallow deer.\r\n\r\nThe great palace has left little more than an archway on Richmond Green.\r\nMore history belongs to it, or rather to the succession of palaces which\r\nhave stood at Sheen, which was the old name, than I can deal with.\r\nEdward III died at Sheen Palace, unloved and alone. Richard II's queen,\r\nAnne of Bohemia, died there seventeen years later, and Richard in his\r\ngrief threw the palace down. It was rebuilt by Henry V, burnt down in\r\n1497, rebuilt and renamed Richmond by Henry VII; then the Richmond who\r\nnamed it died in his new palace. But the overmastering sense of\r\nunhappiness which somehow has set itself about the story of Richmond\r\nPalace belongs to the closing days of Elizabeth. Elizabeth's death, and\r\nthe month that went before it, patch English history like a week of\r\nnight. She had been so strong, so untiring, so wise in her council\r\nchamber and so magnificent in her victorious fleet, and the fortune that\r\nfollowed her like a wind; the life of her body had been so unfailing,\r\nshe had jested, wittily and coarsely, with so many courtiers; she had\r\ncommanded the chivalry of young and splendid nobles, she had lived to\r\nsee one of her favourites die and to send another to the block; and now\r\nshe herself was dying. She knew it, and she would not hear of death. She\r\nwas never so ready for the gaiety she could not enjoy. Her strength left\r\nher, she was a skeleton; still she sat with her dress unchanged, staring\r\nbefore her, flashing sudden rages at her ministers, rallying at the\r\nmention of an heir's name. Beauchamp, heir to the Suffolks, they put\r\nforward; she cried out he was the son of a rogue. The King of Scots?\r\nthey asked; she answered nothing. Dead, propped among her pillows, an\r\nold woman in ruff and stays, the memory of her last days shadows\r\nRichmond Palace like a drawn blind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Richmond Hill._]\r\n\r\nTo the north beyond Richmond Hill and the huge hotel, twice burnt down,\r\nwhich looks over the woods and the river, one may come by tramways and\r\nrailways to Kew and Kew Gardens. Kew, too, once had a palace, or an\r\nattempt at a palace. Frederick Prince of Wales, George III's\r\nfather--the prince who did so much for Surrey cricket, and died,\r\nperhaps, from the blow of a cricket ball--lived at Kew House, and so did\r\nGeorge III after him. George III pulled down Kew House in 1803, and\r\nbuilt another; to be not less royal, George IV pulled that down. A\r\nsmaller building, vaguely named Kew Palace still, stands in the Gardens;\r\nQueen Charlotte died there; you may see the room, and look, if you wish,\r\non the tables and sofas she knew. But the pictures in Kew Palace were\r\nnot all Queen Charlotte's; they are catalogued to-day, and so are many\r\nmanuscripts and autograph letters of royal persons which attract careful\r\nreaders. From remarks which can be overheard in those sombre rooms, many\r\nvisitors, I think, imagine the paintings of still life, of flowers in\r\nvases, odd representations of game and fruit, and so forth, to have\r\nbeen selected and hung in the house as specially suitable for public\r\ngardens. The portraits of royal gentlemen in blue and red puzzle them;\r\nwhy should they be shown these at Kew? These are for palaces and\r\ngalleries; Kew is for a flower show.\r\n\r\nWhat is the chief, the compelling fascination of Kew Gardens? What is it\r\nthat sets Kew apart, not more beautiful than other gardens, but\r\ndifferent from them, with a different attraction peculiarly its own? Is\r\nit the sense of change from roaring streets to quiet lawns, noble trees,\r\nspaces and scents of grass and flowers? There may be a sense of change,\r\nbut that is not all the secret, for Kew keeps the same charm for one who\r\nhas come fresh from the broad aisles and avenues of some great country\r\ngarden. Is it the rarity and the wealth of the Kew museums and\r\nhouses--the orchid houses with their strange, lovely, uncanny\r\ninflorescences, flowers that have fancies and wilfulnesses, flowers that\r\nwould people the dark with faces; or the lily-houses and the superb\r\n_Victoria regia_ that would cradle a water-baby; or the great palm\r\nhouses, where you may walk in a gallery among enormous leaves and\r\ntropical creepers as if you were back again with your grandfathers in\r\nthe tree tops? That is an attraction, but it is not all of it. Nor is it\r\nthe achievement of the gardens in the separate spheres of gardening. The\r\nsheets of crocuses in the low March sunlight, and of daffodils shaking\r\nin an April wind, add a glory to the spring at Kew, but it is a glory\r\nthat can belong to other lawns and other vistas of flowers. The Kew\r\nrose-garden has a wealth of roses, but it has, too, a wealth of old tree\r\nstems and broken branches which a garden meant for nothing but roses\r\nwould hide. The herbaceous border grows luxuriant phloxes and\r\ndelphiniums, but the background of glass houses sets a wrong light about\r\nit. The rock garden shows more rock and fewer masses of Alpine flowers\r\nthan other English gardens more lately made, with better knowledge of\r\nwhat wall and rock flowers need.\r\n\r\nThen what is the abiding charm? To me, at all events, Kew has much the\r\nsame appeal as the Londoner finds in Richmond Hill. It is a London\r\ngarden, the garden of a town, perfectly made for its purpose. It can\r\nnever, even with its glorious trees and its wide spaces of grass, have\r\nthe peace or know the spirit of a country garden. Too many feet tread\r\nits lawns; too many voices chatter in its walks. It may spread its wild\r\nflowers and grow its curious blossoms for those who know where and how\r\nto look for them; but its main effects must be of ordered gravel, of\r\nshaven grass, of patterned beds, of flowers that will suit artificial\r\nlakes and buildings and stone balustrades. The keynote of Kew is by the\r\nwide pond, with the smooth green turf and the white stone, and the\r\nmasses of pansies and heliotrope and brilliant red geraniums. Those are\r\nthe flowers which suit best the steps down to the water, and the\r\nfountains, and the swimming ducks and the birds on the banks. There is\r\nthe right touch of artificiality about them; the right note of London.\r\nThe birds are Londoners themselves. The stately brown geese stalk over\r\nthe lawns careless of poulterers or punt-guns. The cormorant, who most\r\ncertainly knows he is being watched, dives to show off before admiring\r\nchildren. Even the blackbirds have forgotten their country habits, and\r\nwill sing when country blackbirds are silent for the year. Once, late in\r\nJuly, I heard four singing in evening sunshine after rain. They would\r\ntake any countryman back to the days of chestnut blossom and the scent\r\nof Surrey may; but that indolent melody, in July sunshine, belongs to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kew Church._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nKINGSTON\r\n\r\n    Kingston Old and New.--The Stone.--The Sexton's Escape.--Throwing\r\n    over the Church.--Ducking a Scold.--Aaron Evans's shot at a\r\n    Cormorant.--The Dog Whipper.--A Feast of the Church.--Lord Francis\r\n    Villiers's fight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kingston._]\r\n\r\nKingston has kept little of the past. An old alehouse, old almshouses,\r\nan old staircase, an old roof or two by the market place, and an old\r\nchapel, Lovekyn's, standing apart--the survivals are the loneliest\r\nthings. Lovekyn's, once a chapel, and now a school, is one of the links.\r\nGibbon was a scholar there, and Gibbon belongs doubly to Surrey; he was\r\nborn at Putney. But the changes at Kingston have made it almost all new,\r\nand the changes have come quickly. Only three or four years ago the\r\nquaint, small Harrow Inn had two companions, the Anglers and the Three\r\nCompasses, one with a fireside corner to warm ale and tell grandfathers'\r\ntales in, the other with traditions of highwaymen and the road. They\r\nwere pulled down. In Market Place there was once a fine Tudor house, the\r\nCastle Inn. The noble staircase remains, a good, thoroughgoing piece of\r\ncarving of Bacchus and full casks; the house has gone. The church is old\r\nenough to have seen these and other losses; but the church is a mixed\r\nbuilding; the tower, or most of it, is eighteenth century brick. Only\r\none spot in the open streets of the town, I think, keeps an air of\r\nKingston as the customers of the Castle Inn may have known it, and that\r\nis the little byway through which runs the water splash of the Hogsmill\r\nriver. Cart horses standing in the ford, and bare-legged children\r\nfishing for minnows, are what Kingston saw in the old days.\r\n\r\nThe Stone remains; the Stone on which tradition says that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon kings were crowned. Once it stood in the chapel of St. Mary,\r\na Saxon building adjoining the church; but St. Mary's Chapel fell in\r\n1730. It was moved to the Market Place; afterwards in 1854, to the open\r\nspace where it now stands opposite the Court-house; on the very spot,\r\nthey say, where there was once an Anglo-Saxon palace. The railing which\r\nsurrounds it has been described as \"of Saxon-like design,\" and perhaps\r\nthat should suffice. On the pedestal which bears up the Stone are the\r\nnames of the kings who were crowned on it: Edward the Elder, Ethelstan,\r\nEdmund, Edred, Edwig, Edward the Martyr, and Ethelred the Unready. What\r\nis the Kings' Stone? A morasteen, the archaeologists tell you; one of a\r\ncircle of stones, on which the chief sat in council with his great men;\r\nthe predecessors of the Anglo-Saxon chiefs would have been Arch-Druids,\r\nperhaps, or pontiff kings, acclaimed by ancient Britons centuries before\r\nthe Romans set foot in Kent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kingston Bridge._]\r\n\r\nKingston church, if its architecture is confused and much of it modern,\r\nhas an imposing solemnity about it, and it contains some strange\r\nmemorials. One is a stone fragment, on which the grateful survivor of an\r\naccident and a ruin has painted the words \"Life Preserved.\" She was\r\nHester Hammerton, daughter of Abram Hammerton, sexton of the church, and\r\nin 1729 she was helping her father to dig a grave in the churchyard\r\nnear the Saxon chapel of St. Mary. They dug too near the chapel\r\nfoundations, and the chapel fell in upon them. The sexton was killed,\r\nalmost on the spot; his daughter was saved through the jamming of a\r\npiece of stone, and survived him as sexton for fifteen years. Another\r\nmemorial is a brass kept in the vestry; a long screed begins dismally\r\nenough--\"Ten children in one grave--a dreadful sight\"; but the verse is\r\nunequal to the opportunity. Another brass shows Robert Skern and his\r\nwife Joan; she, according to Manning and Bray, was a daughter of Alice\r\nPerrers, mistress of Edward III. A fourth monument, said to be in the\r\nchancel (but I did not find it), praises Mrs. Mary Morton, daughter of\r\nthe wife of Robert Honeywood, of Charinge, Kent; she was \"the Wonder of\r\nher Sex and this Age, for she liv'd to see near 400 issued from her\r\nLoynes.\" So Aubrey describes it, and so, with variations, the local\r\nhistorian. Mrs. Mary Morton died in 1620.\r\n\r\nAubrey has another record of the giants of those days. He had heard of\r\none Wiltshire of the Feathers Inn at Kingston, who was a great thrower.\r\nHe would stand in the churchyard and throw a stone over the weathercock;\r\n\"he would also throw a stone over the Thames (by the bridge) and struck\r\nthe pales on the town side, which (I think) was not so difficult as the\r\nother throw. He was then of middle stature, and about thirty years of\r\nage.\" But if he had grown to greater stature? The weathercock of those\r\ndays is no more, or we might measure the throw.\r\n\r\nKingston has other history besides its coronation stone and its\r\nmonuments. The Parish Registers have added pictures of its past. Here is\r\none of two poor women allowed to beg at the church:--\r\n\r\n    February 1571.\r\n\r\n    24. Sonday was here ij wemen the mother and dowghter owte of Ireland\r\n    she called Elynor Salve to gather upon the deathe of her howsbande a\r\n    genllman slayne amongst the wylde Iryshe being Captain of Gully\r\n    glasses and gathered xviijd.\r\n\r\nHere is a record of a Thames flood, October 9, 1570:--\r\n\r\n    Thursday at nyght rose a great winde and rayne that the Temps rosse\r\n    so hye that they myght row w^t bott^s owte of the Temps a gret waye\r\n    in to the market place and upon a sodayne.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1572 Kingston got a new cucking stool; the Kingston scolds\r\nhad become past bearing. It cost L1 3_s._ 4_d._, and as soon as it was\r\nfinished there was a very shrewish woman ducked in it.\r\n\r\n    1572 August. On Tewsday being the xix daye of this monthe of\r\n    August ---- Downing wyfe to ---- Downinge gravemaker of this paryshe\r\n    she was sett on a new cukking stolle made of a grett hythe and so\r\n    browght a bowte the markett place to Temes brydge and ther had iij\r\n    Duckinges over hed and eres becowse she was a common scolde and\r\n    fyghter.\r\n\r\nHere are extracts from the burial registers:--\r\n\r\n    June 4. 1593.

A Bird called a Cormorant light on the top of the\r\n    steeple and Aaron Evans shot, but mist it.\r\n\r\nHere are items from the churchwarden's accounts. The parish dog whipper\r\nhad become an institution:--\r\n\r\n    1561. To fawcon for di yere (half a year) whyppyng of doggs oute of\r\n    the churche.                                                  viijd\r\n\r\n    1578. To wrighte for beating the dogges out of the churche, for half a\r\n    yeare.                                                         vjd.\r\n\r\nBut the morris dance--it was the dances that Kingston would spend money\r\nupon. There were two kinds of games which brought gifts to the church,\r\nMay-games and the Kyngham. What sort of a game the Kyngham was nobody\r\nknows, but it brought the churchwardens most of their money: four or\r\nfive pounds was a good collection. But the expenses could be heavy;\r\nthere were shoes for the morris dancers, six pairs at 8_d._ a pair;\r\nthere was silver paper for the dance, 8_d._; and there were for the\r\nfeast, besides other drinking, a quarter of malt, 4_s._; 5 goce (geese),\r\n15_d._; eggs, 6_d._; lamb, 18_d._; sugar, cloves, and mace, 11_d._;\r\nsmall raisins, 3_d._; saffern, 2_d._; vinegar and salt, 3_d._; 2 cocks,\r\n18_d._; 2 calves, 5_s._ 8_d._; sheep, 12_d._; lamb, 16_d._; quarter of\r\nveal, 8_d._; quarter of mutton, 6_d._; leg of veal and a neck, 4_d._ The\r\nmorris dancers did well, with silver paper and new shoes; but the church\r\nkept a feast.\r\n\r\nKingston has the credit of the first and the last battles in the\r\nParliamentary wars, but the claim is a little shaky. There was an affair\r\nof outposts between Rupert's cavalry and some Parliamentarian troops\r\nbetween Oatlands and Kingston bridge in the year 1642--after\r\nEdgehill--but it was not a battle. The real battle of Kingston came six\r\nyears later, and ended all the warfare that Surrey saw. That was the\r\nbattle which crushed Lord Holland's scheme of raising London for the\r\nKing. We shall meet Lord Holland at Reigate; but the fighting belongs to\r\nKingston. Holland, who had planned a rising on Banstead Downs, and had\r\nhoped to capture and hold Reigate Castle, was in full retreat. At\r\nReigate he had feared to hold the position he had taken up; he retreated\r\non Dorking, and from Dorking, pursued by Major Audley of Livesey's\r\nHorse, he fled north. On Kingston Common, a little south-east of where\r\nSurbiton to-day takes train for London, his horse turned on their enemy;\r\nhis infantry fell back. From each side a few spurred out, \"playing\r\nvaliantly,\" Audley writes. But the Royalists were beaten. Lord Francis\r\nVilliers, younger brother to the Duke of Buckingham, a boy of great\r\npersonal beauty, fought alone in their rear. His horse was shot under\r\nhim; he backed towards an elm, and fought with six of them. They came up\r\nbehind him, pushed off his helmet and cut him to the ground. Report came\r\nto London that he was wounded, and orders were sent out to care for him.\r\nBut he was found dead, and his pockets were rifled. The evening was the\r\nend of the war in Surrey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Swan, Thames Ditton._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DITTONS AND WALTON\r\n\r\n    Surbiton trains.--Thames Ditton.--Parks for trotting ponies.--A\r\n    forlorn garden.--The Dandies' Fete.--Graveyard poetry.--The\r\n    Pleasance of a Ferry.--Giggs Hill cricket.--Ditton Tulips.--Hampton\r\n    Bridge.--A dreary road.--Walton.--The Scold's Bridle.--John Selwyn\r\n    and the Stag.--Terror at an elephant.--William Lilly, astrologer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurbiton is a growth of seventy years, and was born when the railway\r\ncame. Once it was called a suburb of Kingston; now it has suburbs of its\r\nown. Tramways join it to London; the railway empties Surbiton into\r\nLondon every morning and pours London back again in the evening. Nearly\r\nseventy trains a day stop at Surbiton on their way down from Waterloo;\r\nnearly eighty stop on their way up. It must be quite inspiriting to lose\r\nyour train, and to know that you have only three minutes to wait; or to\r\ncatch the train before your train, or to choose which you will have of\r\ntwo trains. Until you realise these figures, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why so many people are rushing about late for the train in\r\nSurbiton station. They are catching the train before.\r\n\r\nBut Surbiton is not all villas; or perhaps it is, and it would be truer\r\nto say that what is not villas within hail of the station is not\r\nSurbiton. Thames Ditton lies rather more than a mile away, and Long\r\nDitton, between Thames Ditton and the railway, straggling, too, beyond\r\nthe railway. Thames Ditton is rapidly becoming rich and prosperous. A\r\nfew years ago it was a little, twisting main street, a ferry, an inn or\r\ntwo, and a church, and was flanked by two fine properties, Ember Court\r\nand Boyle Farm. Now the villa-builder has got to work, and the old\r\nestates are being sliced up into acres and half acres. Ember Court was\r\nonce a manor belonging to Henry VIII, who hunted over it; later, it was\r\nthe property of Sir Arthur Onslow, the first Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons who earned the title \"Great.\" It is now a racecourse; trotting\r\nponies and American \"machines\" dash and flash where Mr. Speaker\r\nsauntered staidly, and theatre bills flare at the entrance gates. Boyle\r\nFarm has fared little better. Once it was the Duchess of Gloucester's,\r\nwife of George the Third's brother; a century later, Lord St. Leonards,\r\nLord Chancellor in Lord Derby's first and shortest-lived Ministry, had\r\nit. Now the park is criss-crossed with brand new yellow roads. I walked\r\nthrough it while it was still ringing with the builder's hammer; and\r\nstraying off the gravel, suddenly found myself in the forlornest little\r\nplace possible--a formal garden, box-trimmed, tiny, deserted; the\r\nnarrow, carefully-planned beds nothing but weeds, the summerhouse at the\r\nside a ruin. A park cut to pieces looks as if it were in anguish. But a\r\ngarden cries.\r\n\r\nThe river at Thames Ditton in 1827 saw a festival which was doubtless\r\nconsidered one of the most prodigious affairs of the season. Five young\r\nbloods, of whom two were the Lords Castlereagh and Chesterfield of the\r\nday, subscribed L500 each to organise an enormous water party, to which,\r\npresumably, everybody was invited who was worth inviting. It was a\r\nsuperb occasion, with illuminations, quadrilles on the lawn, singers\r\nfrom the opera, covers for five hundred people, and all adornments\r\nproper to such gaiety. Afterwards it came to be known as the Dandies'\r\nFete, and Tom Moore wrote a set of verses about it, which, perhaps,\r\nreflect fairly accurately the wit of the company. Here are nine lines\r\nout of many:--\r\n\r\n    \"Accordingly, with gay Sultanas,\r\n    Rebeccas, Sapphos, Roxalanas--\r\n    Circassian slaves, whom Love would pay\r\n      Half his maternal realms to ransom;--\r\n    Young nuns, whose chief religion lay\r\n      In looking most profanely handsome!\r\n    Muses in muslin--pastoral maids,\r\n    With hats from the _Arcade_-ian shades;\r\n    And fortune-tellers--rich, 'tis plain,\r\n    As fortune-_hunters_, form'd their train.\"\r\n\r\nMoore sent the verses to Mrs. Norton; she, perhaps, was a Circassian or\r\na nun.\r\n\r\nBut Thames Ditton has had its own poet. He has been dignified by the\r\ncriticism of Charles Lamb, and his accomplishment was the composing of\r\nepitaphs. \"What is the reason,\" Lamb writes to Wordsworth in 1810, \"we\r\nhave no good epitaphs after all?\"\r\n\r\n    A very striking instance might be found in the churchyard of\r\n    Ditton-upon-Thames, if you know such a place. Ditton-upon-Thames has\r\n    been blessed by the residence of a poet, who for love or money, I do\r\n    not well know which, has dignified every gravestone, for the last\r\n    few years, with brand-new verses, all different, and all ingenious,\r\n    with the author's name at the bottom of each. This sweet Swan of\r\n    Thames has so artfully diversified his strains and his rhymes, that\r\n    the same thought never occurs twice; more justly, perhaps, as no\r\n    thought ever occurs at all, there was a physical impossibility that\r\n    the same thought should recur. It is long since I saw and read these\r\n    inscriptions, but I remember the impression was of a smug usher at\r\n    his desk in the intervals of instruction, levelling his pen. Of\r\n    death, as it consists of dust and worms, and mourners and\r\n    uncertainty, he had never thought; but the word 'death' he had often\r\n    seen separate and conjunct with other words, till he had learned to\r\n    speak of all its attributes as glibly as Unitarian Belsham will\r\n    discuss you the attributes of the word 'God' in a pulpit; and will\r\n    talk of infinity with a tongue that dangles from a skull that never\r\n    reached in thought and thorough imagination two inches, or further\r\n    than from his hand to his mouth, or from the vestry to the\r\n    sounding-board of the pulpit.\r\n\r\n    But the epitaphs were trim, and sprag, and potent, and pleased the\r\n    survivors of Thames-Ditton above the old Mumpsimus of 'Afflictions\r\n    Sore'....\r\n\r\nThe church itself, or at all events the squat and tiny tower, has not\r\naltered much since Lamb saw it. But the epitaphs have gone. Search among\r\nthe ivies and yews of the shady little churchyard will discover a number\r\nof flat, weatherworn slabs of stone, but the verses and the signatures\r\nhave vanished. Fire and the wastepaper man are the common lot of poets,\r\nbut this \"Swan of Thames\" has come to his end by rain and hobnails. The\r\nonly Swan that remains is the inn, whose sign sits comfortably above the\r\nfront door, white and bright. Few Thames-side inns have a prettier\r\noutlook, or look prettier from the river. Sunlight on shining brown\r\nboats and quivering willows is a frequent memory of Thames waters, but\r\nthe Swan lies also opposite a ferry, and a ferry has a hundred\r\nfascinations. Old fashioned rowing, running water, hailings and\r\nsignallings, quiet motion, thriving business, new arrivals; it is all\r\nthe cheerfullest of riverside traffic. None of the pleasanter services\r\nof travel can be more directly rendered and directly paid for than being\r\nferried across a river.\r\n\r\nOf Surrey village greens, the Thames Ditton Ground at Giggs Hill has had\r\nmuch to do with Surrey cricket. Giggs Hill cricket has not always been\r\nof the most scientific kind, but who shall say it was less enjoyed for\r\nthat? An old Giggs Hill cricketer tells us how the pitch used to be\r\nprepared for a match. \"I remember,\" he says, \"seeing the late Harry\r\nStowell with an old beer barrel fixed on a trolley and filled with\r\nwater, wheeling it across the wicket. He would well douse the pitch, and\r\nafter running a small garden roller he had borrowed up and down a few\r\ntimes the wicket was ready.\" This proceeding took place the day before\r\nthe match, so that batting must occasionally have been a venturesome\r\nbusiness. In those days a match meant what it still means in some\r\nvillages, an adjournment in the evening to the neighbouring inn, a\r\nsupper, beer, and songs. How many old inns still keep the name \"The\r\nJolly Cricketers,\" and how many for little reason! In later days, Thames\r\nDitton cricket has become scientific enough. The Giggs Hill ground has\r\nsent to the Oval cricketers like H.H. Stephenson, who was making\r\ncenturies for the county in the sixties; in modern times the great\r\nMaurice Read, whom Mr. John Shuter has described as having \"started a\r\nnew order among cricket professionals,\" learned his cricket at Thames\r\nDitton. But the greatest of all Thames Ditton cricketers is, of course,\r\nTom Richardson. He was actually born at Byfleet, but played as a boy at\r\nGiggs Hill.\r\n\r\nThames Ditton's sister, Long Ditton, is probably known by sight by\r\nthousands of people who do not know its name. You are looking at the\r\nbest of Long Ditton when you see Barr's nursery gardens from the train\r\nwindow. There is hardly a month in the year, except in the deep of\r\nmidwinter, when the Ditton Hill gardens are not full of blossom. They\r\nare never more glorious than in May and early June, when the long\r\nparterres glow with the tall, late-flowering tulips. Of all flowers\r\nwhich have been added to English gardens in the last twenty years, the\r\ngreat thirty inch tulips seem to me the finest. A giant daffodil can be\r\nsuperb, but it always looks like a giant. But these tulips have the\r\ngrace of slightness and the majesty of height; their open chalices burn\r\nwith the heat of jewels and the depth of the heart of wine; and here are\r\nten thousand of them. Perhaps the daffodils, earlier in the year, light\r\nthe gardens with a fresher lustre; but the tulips have the colour and\r\nthe glow. Railways have the good luck to run by many nursery gardens;\r\nthe tulips at Ditton Hill would help the South Western to challenge any\r\nline.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Thames Ditton ferry lies Hampton Court Park, a\r\nnoble stretch of ordered green. From the ferry to Hampton Court Bridge\r\nis a mile by river, and nearly twice as much by road, which runs through\r\nEast Molesey. There is little of interest in either of the Moleseys,\r\nEast or West, but it is worth walking a dull mile or two to look down\r\nstream from the Bridge over Henry VIII's palace, with its yews and elms,\r\ndark and stately, in the garden beyond the imposing walls. There is a\r\nfar more comprehensive view of Hampton Court to be had from the railway\r\nor the river, but it is still a fine pile of brick seen down stream from\r\nthe Bridge. Up stream, Hampton Church stands a mile away at the bend of\r\nthe river, grey in the sunshine; between the church and the bridge is\r\nthe lock, bright with boats in summer, and the weir, tumbling down a\r\nroar of green water to make roach-swims and barbel-swims for patient\r\nfishermen. In the road to the left you may catch sight or sound of one\r\nof the London coaches, with its white-hatted driver and painted panels,\r\nwell named the Vivid. Molesey's roads carry away many of the motor cars\r\nthat run to Hampton Court; but the old Vivid still jangles hopefully\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nNorth and west of Molesey runs the ugliest road in Surrey. It begins\r\nwith the paling running round the Hurst Park racecourse, and it goes on\r\nbetween the ramparts of enormous reservoirs. To stand on the edge of one\r\nof these great basins of water (it is strictly forbidden to do so) is\r\nto get a new meaning of desolation. They are horribly deep--you can see\r\nhow deep if you stand above one which is half empty; the sides slope so\r\nsteeply that if you fell in you could never climb out again, and they\r\nare the loneliest stretches of water conceivable. No bird has any need\r\nthat brings him to water that has no shelter and no food. Once I watched\r\na sunset in November across one of these reservoirs. When the sun sank\r\nlow the water blackened; the wind drove little waves slapping with foam\r\nagainst the stone bank; a single sea-gull swept up out of the dark and\r\nfled away down wind like a scrap of torn paper; it was the most solitary\r\nending a day could have.\r\n\r\nThe reservoirs by Molesey stretch far back from the river. Nearer the\r\nriver the birds find them more hospitable. I remember a day in October\r\nwhen I stood watching the martins making one of their last halts on the\r\nway south over the reservoirs on the river bank at Surbiton. It was a\r\npouring wet afternoon, there was a high wind, and the rain drove bubbles\r\nin the ruffled water and half blotted the greens and greys of blown\r\nwillows and the russet of thorn berries on the far side of the river. A\r\nshort trolley line ran down a stone pier from beside the road to the\r\nedge of the water, where a barge with a bright brown sail waited; the\r\nsmoke from a clinker fire built in a pierced bucket swept fitfully about\r\nthe pier; grimy men loaded a car on the trolley line. Over the grey-blue\r\nwater hundreds of house-martins dipped and darted and chattered; my\r\numbrella blew inside out, a few scared birds near me tossed up into the\r\nsky and fell down again, joining the hundreds circling and curtseying in\r\nthe wind and the rain.\r\n\r\nThe road from Molesey runs west to Walton-on-Thames, where you strike\r\nthe river high enough to find it running through something like real\r\ncountry. Walton has an interesting old manor house and a Norman church a\r\ngood deal spoiled by restorers. In the vestry, preserved in a cabinet\r\nmade out of an old beam from the belfry, is a relic of days when women\r\ntalked too much--a scold's or gossip's bridle. It is a sort of cage\r\nshaped to fit the head and made of steel, which time has rusted and\r\nblackened. A kind of bit is arranged to go into the scold's mouth and\r\nhold her tongue, and according to those who have been voluntarily\r\nbridled--nobody can remember a scold in Walton--it answers its purpose\r\nadmirably. When the bit is in and the bridle properly padlocked the\r\nmost vixenish can only utter inarticulate murmurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walton Church._]\r\n\r\nAmong some curious old brasses in the church is one which commemorates,\r\n\"John Selwyn 'gent,' Keeper of her Matis Parke of Oteland vnder ye right\r\nhonorable Charles Howward Lord Admyrall of England his good Lord and\r\nMr.\" He died on March 22, 1587, and his brass illustrates a remarkable\r\nincident. John Selwyn, dressed in a most workmanlike costume like a\r\nScots gillie with a ruff, is shown riding on the back of a stag, into\r\nwhose throat he is plunging a great hunting-knife. Two stories explain\r\nthe picture. One, told in the _Antiquarian Repertory_, is that Selwyn,\r\n\"in the heat of the chase, suddenly leaped from his horse upon the back\r\nof the stag (both running at that time with their utmost speed), and not\r\nonly kept his seat gracefully in spite of every effort of the affrighted\r\nbeast, but, drawing his sword, with it guided him toward the Queen, and\r\ncoming near her presence, plunged it in his throat, so that the animal\r\nfell dead at her feet.\" Another version told locally is that the stag\r\nwas charging Queen Elizabeth when the keeper rode up, leapt on its back\r\nand killed it, but was killed by the stag as it fell. It does not seem\r\nimpossible. Against the story of the keeper being killed in rescuing the\r\nQueen, Mr. F.W. Smith, a local authority, has urged that Queen Elizabeth\r\nwould hardly have been hunting six weeks after the execution of Mary\r\nQueen of Scots, and also when the Armada was almost on its way. But\r\nnobody in England, certainly not Drake, ever stopped doing anything\r\nbecause the Armada was coming, and as for hunting six weeks after the\r\ndeath of Mary Queen of Scots, that would be nothing out of the way for\r\nQueen Elizabeth. A huge oak, thirty feet in girth, is spoken of as the\r\ntree under which the stag was killed at the Queen's feet, but nobody\r\ncould tell me where it was. There are many superb oaks in the gardens in\r\nWalton and Weybridge. Once the whole district was included in Windsor\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nHidden in a group of obscure cottages stands the old manor-house, partly\r\npreserved as a curiosity, partly as an addition to a garden. The house\r\nwas not improved by an experience for some years as a tenement dwelling,\r\ncrowded with more families than it should have held. It was rescued from\r\nthat indignity by its present possessor, Mr. Lowther Bridger. Heavy\r\nbeams, oak panels, and a fine chimney-piece remain, relics of the Stuart\r\ndays when John Bradshaw, President of the Council, had the house.\r\nTradition, certainly wrongly, says that Bradshaw signed Charles's\r\ndeath-warrant in the hall. Bradshaw, no doubt, signed it at Westminster.\r\nBut the association of his name would be enough for village gossip. \"The\r\nplace where they cut off the king's head,\" is a variant of the story.\r\n\r\nAbove Walton Bridge are Coway Stakes, where Julius Caesar is supposed to\r\nhave crossed the Thames in pursuit of Cassivellaunus, king of the\r\nCatuvellauni. The British chief drove sharpened stakes into the bed of\r\nthe river, to block the ford, and built a palisade along the bank, where\r\nhe waited for the enemy. They came on, cavalry and infantry, in spite of\r\nthe stakes. The Catuvellauni would have met them, but fled in horror at\r\nthe sight of an armoured elephant.\r\n\r\nA great cricketer is buried in Walton churchyard, and a great astrologer\r\nin the church. The cricketer was Lumpy Stevens, whom we met at Send. The\r\nastrologer was William Lilly, author of a yearly publication, _Merlinus\r\nAnglicus Junior_, a sort of Old Moore's Almanac. The prophecies of\r\nstorms, fires and disasters were as dull reading then as they are now,\r\nbut one or two entries in his _Life and Times_, written by himself, are\r\nilluminating, especially his record of family amenities, thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"The 16th of February 1653/4, my second Wife died; for whose Death\r\n    I shed no Tears. I had 500_l._ with her as a Portion, but she and\r\n    her poor Relations spent me 1000_l._ _Gloria Patri, & Filio, &\r\n    Spiritui Sancto: sicul erat in principio et nunc et semper, & in\r\n    saecula saeculorum_: For the 20th of _April_ 1653, these Enemies of\r\n    mine, _viz._ Parliament-men, were turned out of doors by _Oliver\r\n    Cromwell_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"In _October_ 1654, I married the third Wife, who is signified in my\r\n    Nativity by _Jupiter_ in _Libra_: And she is so totally in her\r\n    Conditions, to my great Comfort.\"\r\n\r\nLilly got into trouble with the Parliament men later. He had predicted a\r\ntown in conflagration, and when the Fire of London occurred in 1666 he\r\nwas accused of having caused it. He had to appear before a Parliamentary\r\ncommittee specially sitting on the matter, but he was able to satisfy\r\nthe chairman that he had nothing to do with the fire. He admitted that\r\nhe had drawn mysterious designs of persons in winding sheets and digging\r\ngraves, which were to foretell the plague, and of towers and houses on\r\nfire, which might have meant the city of London blazing; but he had\r\nnever fixed the exact year for these things to happen. So the committee\r\nlet him off. If he had lived till the next century, when William the\r\nThird's horse had thrown his rider, and the Jacobite toast was \"the\r\nlittle gentleman in black velvet,\" Lilly could have pointed with pride\r\nto other cabalistic drawings in his _Merlin_ One shows a mole walking\r\nabout under a dragon; another, a mole attacking a crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Epsom._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nEPSOM\r\n\r\n    The Widest Street in Surrey.--A lucky find.--Barbara\r\n    Villiers.--Pepys at the Wells.--Nell Gwynne.--Aldermen and lazy\r\n    ladies.--Epsom's fall.--A knavish apothecary.--Baron Swasso, his\r\n    house.--Miss Wallin, bone-setter; bone-setter, Mrs. Mapp.--Epsom\r\n    re-made at the table.--Eclipse.--The Road to the Derby.--The Ring\r\n    round the Gibbet.--Catherine-wheels, Motor-cars, Kites, Pills.--Lord\r\n    Rosebery.--Lord Lyttelton's ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpsom is the centre of the country between the great railway lines. It\r\nhas its own railway, but it is midway between the lines that run express\r\ntrains to Brighton and Southampton: Epsom's own expresses only run for\r\ntwo weeks in the year, when the races come round. For the other fifty\r\nweeks Epsom is a quiet town of villas, once a village, now nearly a\r\nsuburb like Esher or Weybridge. Lord Rosebery sometimes lives near the\r\ntown, at Durdans, and deplores the large numbers of lunatics who are\r\nbrought to live near the town always. But Epsom is only occasionally\r\nruffled by the lunatics, and has developed a dangerously good train\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nEpsom has the widest and breeziest main street of any Surrey town, and\r\nyou do not guess the reason until you read the history of the town\r\npretty closely. The story of Epsom, until the two great races that\r\nbelong to its downs were founded over Lord Derby's wine, is the story of\r\nits wells. Before Epsom Salts there was hardly an Epsom to give them a\r\nname. There may have been a tiny village where the church stands, but\r\nthat would be all; the rector preached to a few cottagers. Then, one hot\r\nsummer day in 1618, the lucky thing happened. Henry Wicker, trying to\r\nwater his cattle on the common, found a small hole with a spring in it;\r\nhe enlarged it, and took the cattle to the water, but could not make\r\nthem drink. Then the doctors were told about it. They used it first, as\r\nPownall the local historian tells you, \"as a vulnerary and abstersive,\"\r\nand healed wounds with it; then some labourers accidentally drank it,\r\nand Epsom's fortune was made. The doctors agreed; Epsom salts were\r\nbitter, diluent, absorbent, soluble, cathartic--everything that salts\r\nshould be. In two years the wells were enclosed with a wall; in twenty\r\nyears France and Germany had heard of Epsom, and distinguished\r\nforeigners obediently paced the common. But the great days were still to\r\ncome. As yet few buildings had grown up close to the Wells, merely \"a\r\nshed to shelter the sickly visitors.\" Then came the year 1670, when\r\nCharles II gave Barbara Villiers his palace of Nonsuch two miles away.\r\nShe, as careless of a king's gift and as avaricious as a king's mistress\r\nshould be, turned the palace into cash, and out of its demolished walls\r\nthe local builder piled up houses by Epsom Wells.\r\n\r\nOne of Epsom's inns was already built, the King's Head--perhaps the Old\r\nKing's Head near the church, or an inn on the same site. Pepys was there\r\nin 1667, and gives us a glimpse of Nell Gwynne, though she was at Epsom\r\nto amuse herself, and was not one of Pepys's party. Pepys went on July\r\n14th (Lord's day); he got up at four in the morning, and talked to Mrs.\r\nTurner downstairs while his wife dressed, and got angry with Mrs. Pepys\r\nbecause she was so long about it. They were off in the coach by five,\r\nwith bottles of wine and beer, and a cold fowl, and talked all the way\r\npleasantly, Pepys writes, and so came \"to Epsom, by eight o'clock, to\r\nthe well; where much company, and I drank the water: they did not but I\r\ndid drink four pints. And to the town, to the King's Head; and hear\r\nthat my Lord Buckhurst and Nelly are lodged at the next house, and Sir\r\nCharles Sedley with them; and keep a merry house.\" Lord Buckhurst had\r\njust persuaded Nell Gwynne to leave the King's playhouse for a hundred\r\npounds a year and his company: she was to act no more, which saddened\r\nPepys. However, she was back at the playhouse next month, jeered at by\r\nthe graceful Buckhurst and as poor as ever. She was less exacting than\r\nBarbara Villiers: she never had a palace to sell.\r\n\r\nWhen Nonsuch was built up again into Durdans and other houses near the\r\nWells, then came the full tide. Epsom was completed. About the year\r\n1690, Pownall dates the climax: Mr. Parkhurst, lord of the manor, built\r\na ball-room seventy feet long, and the inns sprang up on all sides.\r\n\"Taverns at that time reputed to be the largest in England were opened;\r\nsedan chairs and numbered coaches attended, there was a public\r\nbreakfast, with dancing and music every morning at the Wells. There was\r\nalso a ring, as in Hyde Park; and on the downs races were held daily at\r\nnoon; with cudgelling and wrestling matches, foot races, &c., in the\r\nafternoon. The evenings were usually spent in private parties,\r\nassemblies or cards; and we may add, that neither Bath nor Tunbridge\r\never boasted of more noble visitors than Epsom, or exceeded it in\r\nsplendour, at the time we are describing.\" So Pownall praises the great\r\ndays; but they have not left a glamour about Epsom, as the days of Nash\r\nand Brummell have shed on Bath.\r\n\r\nWhy has Epsom so broad a main street? In the great days the open way was\r\nnarrower. Down the centre of the road as we see it Mr. Parkhurst planted\r\na long walk of elms, and there they stood from James the Second's day\r\ntill the nineteenth century. Then Sir Joseph Mawbey, lord of the manor,\r\ncut them down and sold the timber. He made a good bargain too; for the\r\ntownpeople were grieved at losing their trees, and to quiet them he\r\npromised to give L200 to help build a market-house, but he never did it,\r\nand kept the cash. The trunks of the fallen trees must have made a\r\npleasant prospect for the New Inn, the fine red-brick building which in\r\nParkhurst's day was built for a tavern, and which still stands, but has\r\nnow fallen to shops. But in the days when the city aldermen brought\r\ntheir wives to show off their finery, and the young sparks threw their\r\nmoney about at Epsom, what a bustling, handsome, pursy, turtle-soup\r\nsort of place the Wells must have been. John Toland, writing in 1711,\r\ndescribes Epsom Wells at their height. Eudoxa is his mistress, and to\r\nEudoxa he pictures all Epsom's charms. I quote a few passages from a\r\nlong letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Here are two bowling-greens with raffling shops and musick for the\r\nladies' diversion, as at Tunbridge; but the ladies do not appear every\r\nday on the walks as there. Here you see them, on Saturdays, in the\r\nevening, as their husbands come from London; on Sundays at church, and\r\non Mondays in all their splendour, when there are balls in the\r\nLong-rooms; and many of them shake their elbows at Passage and Hazard\r\nwith a good grace.\"\r\n\r\nSurely they never forgave Toland for writing that. Here he writes on the\r\nladies' husbands:--\"By the conversation of those that walk there, you\r\nwould fancy yourself to be this minute on the Exchange, and the next at\r\nSt. James's; one while in an East India factory, and another while with\r\nthe army in Flanders, or on board the fleet in the Ocean; nor is there\r\nany profession, trade, or calling that you can miss of here, either for\r\nyour instruction or diversion.\"\r\n\r\nThus does Toland, unkinder than Pownall, set out the glories of Epsom\r\nwithout comparing them to Bath. But what could be better than the luxury\r\nof it all? \"You would think yourself in some enchanted camp, to see the\r\npeasants ride to every house with the choicest fruits, herbs, roots and\r\nflowers; with all sorts of tame and wild fowl, with the rarest fish and\r\nvenison, and with every kind of butcher's meat, among which\r\nBanstead-down mutton is the most relishing dainty. Thus, to see the\r\nfresh and artless damsels of the plain, either accompanied by their\r\namorous swains or aged parents, striking their bargains with the nice\r\ncourt and city ladies, who, like queens in a tragedy, display all their\r\nfinery on benches before their doors (where they hourly censure, and are\r\ncensured), and to observe how the handsomest of each degree equally\r\nadmire, envy and cozen one another, is to me one of the chiefest\r\namusements of the place. The ladies who are too lazy, or too stately,\r\nbut especially those who sit up late at cards have their provisions\r\nbrought to their bedsides, where they conclude the bargain with the\r\nhigler; and then--perhaps after a dish of chocolate--take another nap,\r\ntill what they have thus purchased is got ready for dinner.\"\r\n\r\nOne single attraction Toland admits Epsom never had--it lacks a river.\r\n\"One thing is wanting--and happy is the situation that wants no more;\r\nfor in this place notwithstanding the medicinal waters, and sufficient\r\nof sweetes for domestic use, are not to be heard the precipitant murmurs\r\nof impetuous cascades. There are no purling streams in our groves, to\r\ntempt the shrill notes of the warbling choristers, whose never-ceasing\r\nconcerts exceed Bononcini and Corelli.\"\r\n\r\nThat was in 1711; Epsom never saw better days in spite of the lack of\r\nthose miraculous concerts. And in 1715 it had all come to an end.\r\nEpsom's glories tumbled like a pack of cards. It was the fault of one\r\nman: Pownall has gibbeted the rascal; Epsom fell through the \"knavery of\r\nMr. John Livingstone, an apothecary.\" Mr. Livingstone may have been a\r\nknave, but he was also evidently a fool. He began admirably, as a doctor\r\nwith a speculative eye should do, by building a large house with an\r\nassembly room for dancing and music, \"and other rooms for raffling,\r\ndiceing, fairchance (what a perversion of terms!) and all sorts of\r\ngaming; together with shops for milliners, jewellers, toymen, etc.\" He\r\nwas quite a heathen, for he planted a grove, and he made a\r\nbowling-green, and then spoiled it all by sinking a well, putting a pump\r\nto it, and calling the place the New Wells. The new water was neither\r\ndiluent, nor absorbent, nor cathartic, nor anything else that water at a\r\nwatering-place should be, and the visitors found out the difference. But\r\nthe end was the maddest thing of all. Somehow or other, John Livingstone\r\ngot a lease of the old wells, the real, genuine spring. Then he locked\r\nup the old wells, and tried to make money with the new. It killed the\r\nwatering-place.\r\n\r\nBut Epsom revived--to relapse and revive again. First, it was brought to\r\nlife again by the South Sea Bubble, which would have brought to life\r\nanything, and for a wild short season the quacks and alchemists and Jews\r\ncame back: the ball rooms and the gaming saloons filled again. New\r\nhouses were built; \"amongst them that of Baron Swasso.\" To speculate as\r\nto who Baron Swasso may have been is agreeable: but the baronial hall\r\ncould not save Epsom. Even a more powerful attraction than Baron Swasso\r\nfailed to do so; or, rather, refused to try. She was Miss Wallin, whom\r\nthe vulgar addressed as Crazy Sally; but she was not so crazy. Miss\r\nWallin was a bone-setter: she could put in a man's shoulder without\r\nhelp, and she was not to be imposed upon. Once a cheat came to her with\r\nhis head done up in a bandage, and asked her to set his dislocated wrist\r\nfor him; it was not dislocated, and he wanted to show Miss Wallin up as\r\nan impostor. She saw through that, and dislocated his wrist on the spot,\r\ntelling him to go back to the fools that sent him. Such a woman should\r\nhave been kept at Epsom; she was worth more than mere cathartic waters.\r\nBut Epsom could not keep her; she desired more than anything else in the\r\nworld to marry one Mr. Hill Mapp, who did not and would not live at\r\nEpsom. She pursued him, always with an eye on the church, and Mapp\r\ncapitulated; but they were married in London. Epsom took back Mrs. Mapp,\r\nbut she could not live for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Mapp, the end came quickly. Sea-bathing finished the little\r\ntown altogether; \"the modern delightful practice of sea-bathing,\" as\r\nPownall puts it with tolerance. He does not give up hope, even in 1825;\r\nhe hopes that the medical profession will still give the wells a trial,\r\nand believes that the waters will be found worthy. After that he comes\r\nto the consideration of Epsom's races.\r\n\r\nWater ended Epsom in 1715; wine began Epsom again in 1780. A party of\r\ngentlemen, drinking at Lord Derby's table at Lambert's Oaks, a house on\r\nthe high ground above the town, lifted their glasses to the glories of\r\nhorse-racing. They founded two races, one, in 1779, for three-year-old\r\nfillies; another, in 1780, for three-year-old colts and fillies. They\r\nnamed the races after their host and the house where they drank, and\r\nEpsom was made again. The Derby and the Oaks became national\r\ninstitutions. Before that roystering party, the downs had seen racing,\r\nbut had not seen a racing crowd. Charles II had run his horses on Epsom\r\nand Banstead downs; perhaps his horse now and then bore away the silver\r\nbell, which was the first and simple prize when horses began racing.\r\nQueen Anne may have entered a colt or two at Epsom: her consort, Prince\r\nGeorge of Denmark, loved horse-racing and drank Epsom waters. Greatest\r\nof all memories of the Turf, Eclipse lived for years by Epsom downs, and\r\nwon poor little races for an obscure commoner. He would have won any\r\nrace he could have been asked by a king, but it was the fate of the\r\nfinest racehorse ever foaled to live before the Derby was founded, and\r\nbefore he could race another horse worthy to pass the starting post with\r\nhim. Pownall, in his _History of Epsom_, has a pleasant passage\r\nextolling Eclipse's merits. He writes in 1825: he has studied, he tells\r\nus, Lawrence's _History of the Horse_ and Bingley's _British\r\nQuadrupeds_, and this is the result:--\r\n\r\n\"Eclipse was withheld from the course till he was five years of age, and\r\nwas first tried at Epsom. He had considerable length of waist, and stood\r\nover a large space of ground, in which particular he was an opposite\r\nform to the flying Childers, a short backed, compact horse, whose reach\r\nlay in his lower limbs; but, from the shape of his body, we are inclined\r\nto believe that Eclipse would have beaten Childers in a race over a mile\r\ncourse with equal weights. He once ran four miles in eight minutes,\r\ncarrying twelve stone, and with this weight Eclipse won eleven King's\r\nplates.[A] He was never beaten, never had a whip flourished over him, or\r\nfelt the tickling of a spur; nor was he ever for a moment distressed by\r\nthe speed or rate of a competitor; out-footing, out-striding, and\r\nout-lasting (says Mr. Lawrence) every horse which started against him.\"\r\n\r\nEclipse, like Homer, had many birthplaces. Mr. Theodore Cook, who has\r\nwritten authoritatively of him where others have guessed or accepted\r\ntradition, has been informed of more than seven; and, in collecting\r\ndetails of relics of the great horse, he has been supplied with evidence\r\nthat Eclipse possessed no fewer than six \"undoubted\" skeletons, nine\r\n\"authentic\" feet, sufficient \"genuine\" hair to have stuffed the largest\r\narmchair in Newmarket, and \"certified\" portions of skin which would\r\neasily have carpeted the yard at Tattersall's. There never was such an\r\nomnipresent animal.\r\n\r\nAfter 1780, the horse-racing crowd grew. In Pownall's time, when the\r\nDerby and Oaks had not been established forty-five years, the Derby\r\nattracted some sixty subscribers, and the Oaks about forty, of fifty\r\nguineas apiece, and Epsom was full to overflowing. The watering-place\r\nhas become a circus. The race week brings down all London. \"At an early\r\nhour in the morning, persons of all ranks, and carriages innumerable,\r\nare seen pouring into the town at every inlet. All the accommodations\r\nand provisions that the surrounding villages can supply are put in\r\nrequisition.\" The royal family would come to look on; sixty thousand\r\nspectators, Pownall thinks, met on the downs.\r\n\r\nBut Pownall has nothing to say of the road. The road must have been the\r\nthing to see; not as we see it to-day, when motor cars start for the\r\ncourse before lunch instead of before breakfast, and luxurious railway\r\ntrains draw decadent race-goers to Tattenham Corner. In the real Derby\r\ndays all racing men that were men drove to Epsom, early in the morning,\r\nby the road. Four-in-hand coaches travelled level in the pack and the\r\ndust by costermongers' donkeys; at every inn there were touts and\r\ntipsters, haunting creatures with secrets of betting; they knew what\r\nwould win outright and what would certainly lose; the Duke's trainer had\r\nwhispered to them, the swindling Captain had tipped them the wink; you\r\nmerely had to pay for the knowledge. Wayside strips of green were turned\r\ninto cocoanut shies, wherever a man might wish to shy at nuts; clowns on\r\nstilts stalked in chequered blue; bare-legged boys and girls turned\r\namazing Catherine wheels. There was the hill to finish with by the\r\ncourse, and the plaudits of the crowd for him who took his team up in\r\nspanking style. They still drive four-in-hand coaches up the hill; but\r\nthe motor-horn follows the coach-horn.\r\n\r\nFrith has made the Victorian Derby day immortal; a less well-known hand\r\nhas written of what Frith painted. The author who signed himself\r\n\"Sylvanus,\" and wrote with an admirable gusto of racing men and racing\r\nscenes in the forties, has set down in his _Bye-lanes and Downs of\r\nEngland_ a strange picture of the Ring on Epsom downs as he saw it. In\r\nhis day it was formed \"on the crest of the Down, round a post or limb of\r\na gibbet\"--_similia similibus_, you might suppose reading the list of\r\nheroes who met there. \"The 'plunging prelate and his ponderous Grace';\r\nmy lord George, the 'bold baker,' and Mr. Unwell; Sir Xenophon\r\nSunflower, the Assassin, and the flash grazier; the Dollar, hellite,\r\nbilliard-marker, and bacon-factor; the ringletted O'Bluster,\r\ndouble-jointed publican, Leather lungs, and Handsome Jack contrasted in\r\nthe pig's skin; and, ye Centaurs! what seats were there!\" It must have\r\nbeen a sight for proper men to see. Not the veriest tailor would walk on\r\nDerby day. He \"would mount a mis-teached hippogriff, and risk the chance\r\nof a purl, rather than not show at the covert-side.\" Who, indeed, would\r\nnot bestride a steed when he might meet the Assassin and the O'Bluster\r\nin the ring? But there were others:--\r\n\r\n    At the time we write of, \"Old Crutch,\" too, with his scaffolding\r\n    under his arm, and disabled limb dangling like a loose girth from\r\n    his rosinante's side, a quadruped equalling the Dollar's mount in\r\n    beauty,--might have been seen side by side with Lord Chesterfield,\r\n    on his thoroughbred, and addressing him in all the Timbobbinish\r\n    horrors of his frightful vernacular. My lord was then in the zenith\r\n    of his good looks and humour, and was, moreover, so well upon\r\n    Cotherstone, that he saw graces in Old Crutch's physog, with the\r\n    charming \"thousand to forty\" he hoped to draw him of on the Tuesday\r\n    _prochain_,--that he joked and rattled with the uncouth old cripple\r\n    in undisguised merriment. With these might have been noticed the\r\n    elegant form of Lord Wilton, on his roan, shaded again by a\r\n    round-shouldered knave from Manchester, with ungloved hands and snub\r\n    nose, who had \"potted the crack\" for his special line of action. His\r\n    yeoman Grace of Limbs, fresh and hearty as a summer gale, mounted on\r\n    his Blue-eyed Maid, loomed in stalwart manhood by the side of some\r\n    pallid greek or city trader, having a word of greeting and jollity\r\n    for all alike, for _he_ was there for the sake of sport, and had no\r\n    anxiety beyond his \"pony.\"\r\n\r\n    The _Heavies_, as Thornhill of Riddlesworth, Sir Hercules\r\n    Fitzoutlawe, and poor fatty Sutherland, together with my Lord\r\n    Miltown, from his not being particularly adapted for an equestrian\r\n    display, appeared in their several chariots on the outskirts of the\r\n    ring, an occasional lull in the wordy tumult permitting the\r\n    Irishman's lisping scream to penetrate the dense and agitated\r\n    circle, in his praiseworthy efforts to do business. Old Crocky, too,\r\n    was there, mounted on a subdued wretch of the horse-species,\r\n    tenanted, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, by the evil spirit\r\n    of some defunct croupier, and ready to \"return on the nick\" as\r\n    usual. In this \"mess tossed up of Hockley-Hole and White's,\" in\r\n    addition to our foregoing inventory, were dukes and butchers....\r\n\r\nBut these are perhaps enough. Has the crowd on the hill changed much\r\nsince the forties? The Ring roars no longer round a gibbet, of course; a\r\nGrand Stand of vast dimensions overlooks the course from starting-gate\r\nto paddock; dukes no longer ride side by side with butchers to make\r\nbets. But the crowd itself, and what the crowd does, and what it sees\r\nand feels--all that, surely, has changed hardly at all. The gipsies\r\nstill swarm, and the touts still swindle; the bookmakers, bedizened with\r\nbelts of silver coin, and outlandish hats, and flaring assertions of\r\npersonal integrity, still clamour by their blackboards; they still chalk\r\nup the odds they offer against horses whose names they mis-spell; the\r\nsun still shines on the jockeys' silk jackets; still, down a course\r\ncleared empty, distracted dogs rush madly; still, before the start for\r\nthe great race, there broods over that huge concourse an intense, almost\r\na dreadful silence; still there is the shout as the jackets flash from\r\nthe starting-gate, still the hum as they sweep down the bend, the roar\r\nas they rush for the straight, the yell as the leader drops back, shoots\r\nout, thunders past the judge. All that remains, and will remain. But two\r\nchanges are insistent. One is the motor-cars, which are all over the\r\nhill and almost everywhere else; but that is a permanent thing. The\r\nother is the advertisements on the kites. In the old days the downs lay\r\nunder blue sky and white clouds. Now they lie, on Derby day, under\r\nstrings of kites. You may go to Epsom to see horse-racing, but you will\r\nnot escape soap, mustard, or pills.\r\n\r\nOf Epsom's residents and neighbours, Lord Derby won the race named after\r\nhim in 1787, and doubtless others have won since. But the best record\r\nbelongs to the owner of Durdans, who won the Derby in 1894 with Ladas,\r\nin 1895 with Sir Visto, and in 1905 with Cicero; and who, in addition to\r\nhis career as politician, man of letters, and owner of racehorses, has\r\nadded difficulties to the tasks of other writers by contributing to Mr.\r\nGordon Home's _Guide to Epsom_ a discouragingly brilliant preface.\r\n\r\nAnother peer has made Epsom history in a different way. At Pit Place\r\nlived the second Lord Lyttelton, and at Pit Place he died, leaving\r\nbehind him a profligate name and a ghost story which Dr. Johnson thought\r\nthe most extraordinary he had ever heard. It was in November, 1779; Lord\r\nLyttelton had just returned from Ireland, and was seized with\r\nsuffocating fits. One night he dreamt a dream. A dove hovered over him,\r\nchanged to a woman in white, and spoke to him. It was a dead face, and\r\nhe knew who it was; her two daughters were under his roof. Her words\r\nwere few: \"Lord Lyttelton, prepare to die!\" \"When?\" he gasped. \"In three\r\ndays,\" she answered, and vanished. He called his man, who found him wet\r\nwith sweat and his whole frame working. The third day came, and he\r\njested with his guests at breakfast--\"If I live over to-night, I shall\r\nhave jockeyed the ghost.\" He dined at five, went to bed at eleven,\r\ncalled his servant a slovenly dog for not bringing a spoon for his\r\nmedicine, and sent for a spoon. The man returned, found him in a fit,\r\nand roused the house. But Lord Lyttelton was dead. He was thirty-five.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Quiet Corner in Witley_ (_p. 159_).]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It is generally admitted, that a horse which will run four\r\nmiles in eight minutes, carrying a weight of eight stone and a-half,\r\nmust win plates.\r\n\r\n_Bingley._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nMID-SURREY DOWNS AND COMMONS\r\n\r\n    Ewell.--A Clear Stream.--Nonsuch Palace.--The Right Use for a King's\r\n    Gift.--Cheam.--Satin Haycocks.--A Chained\r\n    Anachronism.--Chessington.--Dancing Round the Mulberry Tree.--A\r\n    House of Mourning.--A Fool for a present.--Esher.--The great horse\r\n    Bendigo.--Macaulay and the Hop-pickers.--Surrey English.--Gypsy boys\r\n    selling a pony.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth and south of Epsom are scattered villages on downs and commons;\r\nsome, like Ewell and Cheam to the north and east, changing the word\r\nvillage into town; others, like Walton-on-the-hill and Headley to the\r\nsouth-west, or Chessington to the north-west, merely groups of cottages\r\nwith a church. Epsom is the centre of the Surrey churches which have\r\nbeen destroyed or disused rather than restored, and the reason for the\r\ndestruction of the group is obscure. Some strange infection ran in the\r\ndestroyer's brains; Epsom, perhaps, began it; Ewell, Cheam, Headley fell\r\nlater; Esher built a new church, but stayed from destroying the old.\r\nWalton, Woodmansterne, and Banstead have been altered almost out of\r\nrecognition of what was old; Chessington alone looks upon almost\r\nuntroubled centuries.\r\n\r\nEwell almost joins Epsom; Ewell with its old name Etwell, which its\r\nhistorians tell you means At ye Well; the guess looks too easy. The well\r\nis plain enough to see; Ewell has pools of the clearest water and\r\nsprings running fast by the side of the street; it is the most definite\r\nbeginning of a river that ever attracted a village to its banks, and it\r\nruns out of the village as the little Hog's Mill river--a stream with a\r\nsparkle in it that deserves a prettier name. But the village which the\r\nstream drew to it has changed. The High Street has kept some of its\r\nolder houses, with upper stories jutting out over the road; but the\r\nchurch which the old houses knew has gone. They pulled it down in the\r\nforties--that unhappy decade for anything ancient and quiet in Surrey\r\nvillages; all they left was the tower, a mighty mass of stone and ivy\r\nthat stands with its nave reft from it, the forlornest and most\r\nmeaningless of ruins. If the tower might stand, why not the nave? They\r\npulled the nave down, and left the tower standing, so Mr. C.J. Swete,\r\none of Epsom's historians, tells you, in order that it \"should remain to\r\nbeautify the landscape.\" They acted, he observes, \"with good taste and\r\njudgment\" in so doing. Theirs is that praise.\r\n\r\nBut Ewell has a greater ruin. Ewell Castle preserves it in Ewell Park;\r\nbut when I was at Ewell the Castle and Park were for sale, and I could\r\nfind no one who could show it me, or even who knew where it was. Few,\r\nperhaps, have seen it, and there can be little to see, by all accounts,\r\nbut what remains is the ruin of Nonsuch Palace--just the foundations of\r\nthe banquet hall; that is all that remains of the palace which was to be\r\nincomparable, like no palace a king ever built before, the royalest\r\nbuilding in Christendom. That was what Henry VIII meant to make it, when\r\nhe began it in 1538, and he had built most of it when he died nine years\r\nlater. It stood unfinished for ten years more; then Mary sold it to the\r\nEarl of Arundell, and he finished it. Elizabeth bought it back, and so\r\nit came a royal palace to the Stuarts; even the Parliamentary wars left\r\nit untouched, and it was the refuge for Charles II's Exchequer at the\r\nfire of London. Pepys has a picture of Nonsuch, just after the\r\nRestoration. \"A very noble house,\" he calls it, \"and a delicate park\r\nabout it, where just now there was a doe killed for the King, to carry\r\nup to the Court.\" Two years later he walked in the park and admired the\r\nhouse and the trees; \"a great walk of an elm and a walnut set one after\r\nanother in order. And all the house on the outside filled with figures\r\nof stories, and good painting of Rubens' or Holbein's doing. And one\r\ngreat thing is that most of the house is covered, I mean the posts and\r\nquarters in the walls, with lead, and gilded. I walked also into the\r\nruined garden.\" That is Charles II; the doe killed in the park for the\r\nKing, the ruined garden. An old print shows Nonsuch in 1582; a great\r\nquadrangle with towers at the corners, and cupolas, which perhaps were\r\ngilt, and bannerets round the cupolas, and countless little windows;\r\nalong the face of the building are high Tudor windows with bas-reliefs\r\nbetween them; in the foreground of the park a great lady rides in a\r\nchariot with gaily caparisoned horses; a greyhound bounds by her side,\r\nspaniels in leash drag a huntsman after the carriage; in the far\r\ndistance, beyond the palace, hounds and men hunt a noble stag, pictured\r\nas if the whole airy chase flew round a cupola. It was a great palace,\r\nand it should be standing to-day, with its lead and its gilt and its\r\nRubenses and Holbeins. But Charles II gave it to Barbara Villiers, and\r\nshe knew the right use for a king's gift.\r\n\r\nCheam, east from Ewell by two miles, has kept not the tower of its old\r\nchurch but its chancel. The little building stands apart in the\r\nchurchyard; you may peep through a grille at the tombs and the pedigree\r\nof sixteen generations of Lumleys, and at a palimpsest brass mounted on\r\na screen. But if Cheam's church has gone, in the village there is still\r\nthe White Hall, a gabled Elizabethan house of painted timber; the\r\ndaintiest and lightest little place, with tiny ordered lawns under its\r\nwhite wood, and old-fashioned flowers in the garden and in the windows.\r\nWhite Hall has the graces of old books, old ladies, old lace. But its\r\ngables and chimneys are not the only happy picture in Cheam. The road\r\nthat passes by the left of the house leads to an untouched corner of\r\nlittle, white wooden cottages, as lowly and as English as anything in\r\ndeep Surrey country, and this is nearly town. They will not last long, I\r\nam afraid; the new Cheam buildings are staring at them.\r\n\r\nAll above Cheam and Ewell are Banstead Downs, once as free and open as\r\nthe downs by the Sussex sea, and even now sunny places where you may\r\nwalk in fresh winds. But the houses are nearer every year, and they will\r\nbe lucky if they escape another asylum; the high ground gives an\r\nopportunity to asylum architects. On Banstead Downs are Lambert's Oaks,\r\nwhere Lord Derby's roystering guests founded great races with bumpers of\r\nclaret, and where Lord Stanley, when he married Lady Betty Hamilton,\r\ngave his famous Fete Champetre, which Horace Walpole guessed would cost\r\nL5,000; Lord Stanley had \"bought all the orange-trees round London,\" and\r\nthe haycocks he imagined were to be made of straw-coloured satin.\r\nBanstead itself, like Woodmansterne, its neighbour to the east, has not\r\nmuch to show of village buildings. Banstead and Woodmansterne churches\r\nhave many memorials to the Lamberts, one of the very old Surrey\r\nfamilies; and it is from Garratt's Hall, whose grounds border Banstead\r\nvillage, that Colonel F.A.H. Lambert dedicates his _Guide to Surrey_, a\r\nvaluable little pocket-book, to Admiral Charles Mathew Buckle, head of\r\nanother ancient Surrey family. One of the oldest things near Banstead\r\nstands in ground once owned by the Buckle family. Nork House has a field\r\nin which stands Tumble Beacon, a mound which saw the flares run from the\r\nhills of Hampshire to London, when the Armada was breasting the Channel\r\nand Hampshire had caught the signal from Dunkerry and the Lizard. Tumble\r\nBeacon would not light an alarm now; or if it did, it would burn pine\r\ntrees and elders and nettles that grow about it, and would scare a\r\nhundred rabbits. How did the trees come there? A beacon should not be\r\nplanted; it should stand open and high and free as when the Spaniards\r\ncame, and from the same spot where Elizabeth's sailors in the Thames saw\r\nits flame, it should wait for jubilees and coronations to send its fires\r\nroaring up into the night.\r\n\r\nNork, etymologists have guessed, may be corrupted from Noverca--perhaps\r\nit once had a Roman owner. There were Romans who lived on the high\r\nground near. Walton Heath, south of Banstead on the chalk plateau, has\r\nhad the pavement of a Roman villa dug from it; I have been told that you\r\nmay still find Roman pavements there, if you know where to dig. But\r\nWalton's chief possession--the village is Walton-on-the-hill, so named\r\nthat you may never mistake it for Walton-on-the-Naze or\r\nWalton-on-Thames--is in the church. It is a leaden font, the only leaden\r\nfont which Surrey possesses, though England has thirty; and of the\r\nthirty English fonts, Walton's is of as fine workmanship and design as\r\nany. Throned apostles circle the bowl, and bless with the right hand, or\r\nhold a book in the left. The church has some interesting old glass in a\r\nsouthern window, and, by an oddly deliberate anachronism, a chained\r\nBible dated 1803. The chain is an old and genuine guard of the printed\r\nword, taken from Salisbury; but why should it chain Georgian printing?\r\nBut Walton has long been anachronistic; there is a tomb outside the\r\nchancel, in a recess of the north wall, on which some modern Latin\r\nscholar has set the inscription, \"Johannes de Waltune hujus ecclesiae\r\nfundator 1268.\" The weather has removed part, but the rest is in black\r\npaint.\r\n\r\nA neighbouring village, Headley, has separated its new and old more\r\ndefinitely. The church has been taken down, all but the porch, which\r\nholds a grave and what looks like the sign of an inn; you may just\r\ndistinguish the royal arms. The pillars of the old church have fallen,\r\nbut where they stood, little clipped box-trees mark the line--a prettier\r\nmemorial than a drawn plan to hang in the vestry, but need the old\r\nchurch have fallen? These level heights, perhaps, provoke\r\nchurch-building, but how few spires stand on the horizons. Ranmer spire\r\nyou may see from half over mid-Surrey, but Ranmer is high on a ridge.\r\nHere you are on a plateau, and the heights see each other no more than\r\nthe low ground. Kingswood's is the best seen of the spires on the\r\nplateau; a shining thing, white as the chalk of the ridge.\r\n\r\nFrom Epsom to the north is quiet, empty countryside. Esher is five miles\r\nto the north-west as the crow flies; something more by road, but the\r\nbest roads near Esher are the wild pathways of Esher common. Midway\r\nbetween Epsom and Esher, but among pastures, not in the heather of the\r\ncommon, is Chessington. Chessington Hall and Chessington Church are deep\r\nin the fields. The Hall may not be to-day quite the simple little\r\nbuilding that Fanny Burney knew, when Samuel Crisp, \"Daddy\" Crisp, had\r\nit, but the garden and the trees, and the avenue to the church where she\r\nwalked and talked over his music with Dr. Burney can be little changed.\r\nIt was at Chessington that Fanny Burney took a packet from the postman\r\nand found herself famous. _Evelina_, which not even her father knew she\r\nhad written, had taken the town. All the talk of the great men was of\r\n_Evelina_. Dr. Johnson was praising it; Sir Joshua Reynolds would not\r\nlet his meals interrupt him, and took it with him to table. Edmund Burke\r\nhad sat through the night to finish it. That was in 1778, and a hundred\r\nand thirty years after that wonderful morning her delight is as\r\ninfectious as dance music. \"Dr. Johnson's approbation!\" she writes in\r\nher diary, \"--it almost crazed me with agreeable surprise--it gave me\r\nsuch a flight of spirits that I danced a jig to Mr. Crisp, without any\r\npreparation, music, or explanation--to his no small amazement and\r\ndiversion.\" She danced round the mulberry tree on the Chessington lawn,\r\nso she told Sir Walter Scott years afterwards.\r\n\r\nShe was just twenty-six. The mulberry-tree still stands by the window,\r\nand the fields by Chessington are still as green and quiet as when poor\r\nMr. Crisp, a writer whom a careless world did not want to read, retired\r\nfrom his disappointments to a home where none but his friends should\r\nfind him. He lies in the churchyard, under the shadow of the quaint\r\nlittle spire that sits on its bells like a candle-snuffer; Dr. Burney\r\nhas written an epitaph for him, in the formal Georgian English that was\r\nalways somewhere, too, in Fanny Burney's head. It was only the girl in\r\nher that kept it out of _Evelina_; after _Evelina_ the girl survives\r\nalmost only in her diary and her letters. The books grow dull.\r\n\r\nEsher, beyond Claygate, is three miles to the north-west, and Claremont\r\nborders Esher Common. Claremont is a house of happiness and mourning.\r\nQueen Victoria spent the brightest days of her childhood there; princes\r\nand princesses have lived here and died before their day; a great name\r\ndarkens its memories, ennobles its history. The first house at Claremont\r\nwas built by Sir John Vanbrugh; afterwards the Duke of Newcastle had it;\r\non his death Lord Clive bought it, pulled it down, and built the\r\nClaremont of to-day. A hundred thousand pounds he spent on the house and\r\ngarden, and in the serenity of his chosen home he should have ended his\r\ndays. Envy and persecution prevented that, and Clive of Arcot and\r\nPlassey died in London. Forty-two years later, in 1816, Prince Leopold,\r\nafterwards King of the Belgians, brought his bride, Princess Charlotte,\r\nto Claremont; she died with her baby the next year, a girl of\r\ntwenty-one. In 1848 Louis Philippe, a refugee from the Revolution, came\r\nto Claremont; he died there in 1850. Seven years after, in 1857,\r\nClaremont and the countryside were in mourning for the Duchess of\r\nNemours, a princess of glorious beauty. Queen Amelie died at the house\r\nin 1866. To-day the Duchess of Albany has Claremont; perhaps, as it lies\r\nso near a great highway, it might be worth while to say that it is not\r\nshown to the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wolsey's Tower, Esher._]\r\n\r\nA ruined palace is Claremont's neighbour. The great gateway of the\r\nbuilding stands on the bank of the Mole, in the grounds of Esher Place.\r\nWilliam of Waynflete built it; Wolsey repaired it, and was sent there in\r\ndisgrace by his King; the Great Seal had been taken from him. Stow has a\r\nstory of the fallen Minister's journey to Esher; Wolsey had left the\r\nriver at Putney, and was riding along sadly enough, when a messenger\r\nbrought him a kind word from the King. In his joy and relief he looked\r\nround for a present to send back; he fixed on Patch, his fool, and\r\nordered him to the Court. Patch was all rage and tears, and stormed his\r\nunhappiness at his master. It was no good; he was for Henry, and six\r\nyeomen--it took the tallest Wolsey had--carried him struggling back to\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nThe Palace did not keep Wolsey long; he was allowed back at Richmond.\r\nAfter him, in Elizabeth's reign, came Richard Drake, and kept Spanish\r\ngrandees prisoners there, taken from the Armada by Sir Francis Drake.\r\nAfter the Drakes came the Lattons, one of whom, John, held a remarkable\r\nnumber of offices under William III. Aubrey gives the list:--\r\n\r\n    In the reign of William III, this John Latton had given him by that\r\n    Prince the Honours and Places following--\r\n\r\n    Equery,\r\n\r\n    Avener,\r\n\r\n    Master of the Buck-Beagles,\r\n\r\n    Master of the Hariers,\r\n\r\n    Master of the Game 10 miles round Hampton-Court, by particular\r\n    patent, distinct from that of Justice in Eyre,\r\n\r\n    Master of the Lodge at the Old Park at Richmond, with a lease of 30\r\n    years from the Crown for the lands thereto belonging,\r\n\r\n    Steward of the Manor of Richmond,\r\n\r\n    Keeper of Windsor-House Park,\r\n\r\n    Head-customer at Plymouth.\r\n\r\n    All which were conferr'd upon him, without asking for, directly or\r\n    indirectly, and were all held together during that reign.\r\n\r\nEsher Palace as John Latton knew it survives now only in old prints;\r\nthey show a long wing on each side of William of Waynflete's gateway.\r\nOpposite the palace a pleasure-boat, half dinghy, half barge, asks for\r\npassengers; on the bank a fashionably dressed lady holds a long fishing\r\nrod hopefully over the river, shaded by an enormous parasol.\r\n\r\nEsher itself is scattered round a village green and a long broad street.\r\nBy the green is the modern church, and in the churchyard a strange tomb.\r\nLord Esher, the late Master of the Rolls, lies in white marble with Lady\r\nEsher; Lord Esher designed the tomb in his lifetime, and would pass it\r\non his way to church. But the real Esher lies away from the village\r\ngreen, along the main road to Portsmouth--a road edged with trees and\r\nstrips of grass; behind the trees stand the little, low, one-storied red\r\nhouses, and Esher's fine inn, the Bear. The Bear has been rebuilt, but\r\nit has kept the air of a coaching inn; in the hall there is a vast pair\r\nof boots, once worn by the postillion of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nEsher's old church lies behind the Bear, the saddest little deserted\r\nplace. Sorrels and grasses wave about its forgotten graves; you open the\r\nchurch door, and you are back in the days of Waterloo. The pews are\r\nsquare and high, the pulpit is a three-decker, the paint is that\r\npeculiar yellow dun which belongs to Georgian and early Victorian\r\naesthetics. But the value of the church is that it is untouched. No\r\nrestorer has laid a hand on the mouldering baize which lines the pews;\r\nno one has knocked down the hideous galleries; nobody has broken into\r\nthe gallery pew in which, warmed by a fireplace and chimney in winter,\r\nthe little Princess Victoria of Kent used to sit when she was allowed to\r\nvisit Claremont. You may see at Esher, better than in any other Surrey\r\nchurch, the surroundings in which our Georgian great-grandfathers\r\nworshipped; the service might almost have ended yesterday--there should\r\nbe a forgotten prayer-book somewhere under a seat, praying for the\r\nhealth of his gracious Majesty King William. Or there might be in the\r\nbody of the church; not in the Queen's pew. I think American visitors\r\nhave been there.\r\n\r\nTo racing people Esher is Sandown, and Sandown is what all travellers\r\nsee from the railway. Of the smaller racecourses few can be prettier;\r\nthe long flank of a green hill, the white pavilion under dark pines, and\r\nthe curving course picked out with fresh painted railings and green\r\ncanvas--it is as spick and span as a lawn. Either in the summer, for the\r\nEclipse Stakes, or in the spring for the steeplechases, most of the\r\ngreat English racehorses go to Sandown. Bendigo won the Eclipse Stakes\r\nof L10,000 for Mr. Hedworth Barclay in 1886--the first time any horse\r\nwon so huge a stake. Bendigo is surely one of the great names. Even\r\nthose who know least about horse-racing may talk of Bendigo; Bendigo\r\nwhom the crowd loved, Bendigo who never failed them, Bendigo who carried\r\n9 stone 7 lb., and won the Jubilee Stakes at Kempton in 1887. I have for\r\nBendigo the affection of a schoolfellow.\r\n\r\nWhat is Surrey English? Lord Macaulay heard it at Esher. He was walking\r\nfrom Esher to Ditton Marsh, he writes on September 22nd, 1854, and he\r\nlistened to it in a public-house:--\r\n\r\n\"A shower came on. Afraid for my chest, I turned into a small ale-house,\r\nand called for a glass of ginger beer. I found there a party of\r\nhop-pickers, come back from the neighbourhood of Farnham. They had had\r\nbut a bad season, and were returning, nearly walked off their legs. I\r\nliked their looks, and thought their English remarkably good for their\r\nrank of life. It was in truth Surrey English, the English of the suburbs\r\nof London, which is to the Somersetshire and Yorkshire what Castilian is\r\nto the Andalusian, or Tuscan to Neapolitan. The poor people had a\r\nfoaming pot before them; but as soon as they heard the price, they rose\r\nand were going to leave it untouched. They could not, they said, afford\r\nso much. It was but fourpence halfpenny. I laid the money down, and\r\ntheir delight and gratitude quite affected me. Two more of the party\r\nsoon arrived. I ordered another pot, and when the rain was over, left\r\nthem, followed by more blessings than ever, I believe, were purchased\r\nfor ninepence.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the English of the Surrey suburbs was different in Macaulay's\r\ndays. There is little dialect left anywhere to distinguish Surrey\r\nEnglish from any other; even the gypsies speak the English of the\r\nsuburbs of London. There are still gypsies on Esher common; I came\r\nacross quite a settlement once, walking over the common to Cobham on a\r\nsunny morning after late April snow. The common was patched with\r\nsparkling white and blue; the snow lay in blue shadows unmelted under\r\nthe gorse bushes, and among the gorse and sodden bracken twenty ponies\r\nsnuffed for grass. Three gypsy boys shuffled through the fern near them.\r\nWhat did they do with the ponies? I asked, and the eldest told me they\r\nsold them; they were good ponies; he was voluble in suburban English.\r\nWhat did they fetch? That depended. What was that one worth?--it was a\r\nsmall chestnut creature with a child's pink pinafore for a halter. \"Ah!\r\nThat one,\" he began, and his eyes became inscrutable. He would have sold\r\nit well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nLEATHERHEAD\r\n\r\n    The Millpond.--Magic water.--Leatherhead Bridge.--The Running\r\n    Horse.--The Tunnyng of Elinour Rumming.--Noppy Ale.--A penny a\r\n    coffin.--Deflected chancels.--Judge Jeffreys and his\r\n    daughter.--_Emma._--Mr. Woodhouse's gruel.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeatherhead ought to be entered from the west and left by the south. To\r\nmeet the little town on the road from Fetcham is to begin with a stretch\r\nof water, which is always a good introduction; and to leave it and\r\ntravel south is to pass through one of the most fascinating valleys of\r\nall Surrey.\r\n\r\nThe stretch of water lying to the west is the millpond, and is unlike\r\nany other pond I know. It is two or three hundred yards long and perhaps\r\neighty yards wide, slopes gradually from the sides over a chalky bottom,\r\nand is of an intense clear green. Here and there are open spaces in the\r\nweeds; patches of deeper blue-green, which can be seen, if you look\r\nclosely, to be moving--a most uncanny motion. The water wells up\r\nincredibly fast and quiet, and surely incredibly cold, from some\r\nunplumbed, invisible source below. It would be interesting to try to\r\nfind the bottom with a plummet, but probably one would be caught by a\r\npoliceman. All that I have tried to do is to throw in white stones,\r\nwhich disappear as if they were swallowed. But the swallowing is a\r\npuzzling thing. The stone strikes the surface and sends out a widening\r\nripple. Then you watch the stone sinking down slowly against the up-rush\r\nof water, but distinct and white and wavering. Then another ripple--a\r\nmere ring of light, in some way mirroring the real ripple of the\r\nsurface--leaps out apparently from the side of the pool a foot or so\r\nunder water, touches the white, wavering stone, and the stone vanishes.\r\nThere is no stirring of mud, as there would be if it struck the bottom\r\nof an ordinary pond; it merely disappears into an invisible mouth in the\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Leatherhead._]\r\n\r\nNo frost ever sets ice on the millpond, it is said, and in hard winters\r\nwildfowl flock to it. I never have seen on the water any fowl that were\r\nwild, but it is crowded with swimming and diving birds. You can count\r\nthirty or forty coots, besides moorhens and a dozen dabchicks or so, and\r\nat the end where the mill stands there are fat duck and a bevy of swans.\r\nIt is an arresting picture, the long, clear surface, the coots with\r\ntheir white foreheads dabbling in the weeds or rushing after one another\r\nwith loud splashings, the dabchicks diving six at a time out of sight,\r\nand the dignified swans breasting the flowing water under the red brick\r\nand lichens of the mill. The coots, unlike all other coots, too,\r\nactually swim up to be fed. There is a strong spell of magic over all\r\nthat strange pool. Some naiad Circe combs her hair far below the weeds,\r\nand has bewitched the wildfowl and the green cold water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ye Olde Running Horse Inn, Leatherhead._]\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to believe that the rushing springs of the millpond\r\nwere in reality the Mole reappearing from her dive below ground at\r\nMickleham, higher up the stream. But if that is so, the river must pass\r\nthrough some kind of filter, for it can be thick and cloudy at\r\nMickleham, but is never anything but clean and pure at the mill. The\r\nmill stream joins the Mole just below Leatherhead Bridge, a fine span of\r\nfourteen arches. The Mole can put on many faces, but I think she is\r\nnowhere in all her journey more fascinating than where she divides her\r\nstream under Leatherhead, and comes dancing down by separate channels to\r\nher broad sheet of ripples at the bridge.\r\n\r\nBeyond the bridge on the left, is the site of a very famous old inn. The\r\npresent inn, the Running Horse, has been partly rebuilt, and has few\r\nexternal attractions, but the mistress of the old inn, four hundred\r\nyears ago, was the subject of an ode written by the Poet Laureate. She\r\nwas Elinour Rumming, ale-wife of a cabaret at \"Lederhede in Sothray,\"\r\nand John Skelton, perhaps to amuse Henry VIII, and perhaps to please\r\nhimself, wrote one of his pungent, tumbling romps of doggerel about her.\r\n\"The Tunning of Elinour Rumming, per Skelton Laureate,\" as one of the\r\nold editions prints it, is an interminable piece of rhyme, mostly an\r\norgy of coarseness, but with a certain rude vigour of humour and live\r\ntruth. Here are a score of lines out of some hundreds:--\r\n\r\nTHE TUNNYNG OF ELINOUR RUMMING, PER SKELTON LAUREATE.\r\n\r\n    \"Tell you I chill\r\n    If that ye wyll\r\n    A while be still\r\n    Of a comelye gyll\r\n    That dwelt on a hyll\r\n    But she is not gryll\r\n    For she is somewhat sage\r\n    And well worne in age\r\n    For her visage\r\n    It would asswage\r\n    A mannes courage.\r\n\r\n      And this comely dame\r\n    I understande her name\r\n    Is Elinoure Rumminge\r\n    At home in her wonnyng\r\n    And as men say\r\n    She dwelt in Sothray\r\n    In a certain stede\r\n    By syde Lederhede\r\n    She is a tonnish gyb\r\n    The deuell and she be sib\r\n      But to take up my tale\r\n    She breweth noppy ale\r\n\r\n    And maketh thereof poorte sale\r\n    To travellers, to tinkers\r\n    To sweters, to swinkers\r\n    And all good ale drynkers\r\n    That will nothinge spare\r\n    But dryncke till they stare\r\n    And bringe them selfe bare\r\n    With now away the mare\r\n    And let us sley care\r\n    As wise as an hare.\"\r\n\r\nThe legend is that Skelton was a fisherman, and used to come over from\r\nNonsuch Palace by Epsom to fish in the Mole. Perhaps he did, and drank\r\nElinour's \"noppy ale\"; in any case, a portrait of the Leatherhead\r\nale-wife found its way into one of his books, with a rhymed couplet\r\nbeneath it:--\r\n\r\n    \"When Skelton wore the Laurell Crowne\r\n    My Ale put all the Ale Wives downe.\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait is of a hag of such appalling ill-favour as would certainly\r\n\"asswage a manne's courage.\"\r\n\r\nAn inn of more interest, though never the subject of a Laureate's ode,\r\nis the old coaching hostel, the Swan. It was a famous house in the\r\nseventeenth century, and cooked the Mole trout as well as the Dorking\r\ninns cooked their water-souchy of carp and tench. The Reverend S.N.\r\nSedgwick, in his ingenious little collection of Leatherhead legends,\r\nadds a strange record to the inn property. He founds one of his stories\r\non a local tradition that the carrying of a dead body can establish a\r\nright of way, and he says that in quite recent times the sum of one\r\npenny has been charged for permission to bring a corpse through the Swan\r\nBrewery Yard, to prevent a right of way being established.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the right of way was established originally by carrying a\r\ndead body over it, there is another Leatherhead tradition of a right of\r\nway which is connected with the church. The church, with the curious\r\ndouble dedication of St. Mary and St. Nicholas, stands apart from the\r\nsouthern road out of Leatherhead, above the banks of the Mole. The tower\r\nis strangely out of the axis of the nave--as much as three or four\r\nfeet--and the tradition is that it was so built to avoid encroaching on\r\nan established right of way. Probably the explanation is something more\r\nsymbolical or superstitious. One of the most learned of all Surrey\r\narchaeologists, Mr. Philip Mainwaring Johnston, holds to the theory that\r\nthese deflections of the church axis are connected with legends of the\r\nCrucifixion. The deflected chancel, he thinks, suggests the head bowed\r\nupon the cross. But the deflected tower seems more difficult. The church\r\nis interesting in other ways. It contains a leather-bound Book of\r\nHomilies, chained in its original position to one of the northern\r\npillars of the nave; and in the porch is an upright gravestone erected\r\nto the memory of Lady Diana Turner, the story being that she chose to be\r\nburied under the very spot where her sedan-chair stood for the Sunday\r\nservice. She was paralysed, and listened to the Homilies from the porch.\r\n\r\nLeatherhead has two faces. She shows one, which is slate and new, to the\r\ntraveller entering the town from Ashtead and Epsom to the north-east;\r\nand another, which is the old bridge and the church road and the best of\r\nher, to those who approach her from Feltham or Mickleham. St. John's\r\nSchool, founded for the sons of poor clergy, lies on the Ashtead road, a\r\nlarge modern building of red and grey patterned brick. But the best of\r\nLeatherhead's houses stand about the Mole. One is Thorncroft, which\r\nrepresents the domain of Tornecrosta in Domesday Book. Another is a fine\r\nearly Georgian building now known as Emlyn House, but formerly as \"The\r\nMansion.\" Alexander Akehurst, M.D., one of the churchwardens who\r\npresented the Book of Homilies to the church, rebuilt this house early\r\nin the eighteenth century, but parts of the older building remain. Once\r\nit belonged to Sir Thomas Bludworth, whose sister married Judge Jeffreys\r\nof the Bloody Assize. According to a local tradition, Jeffreys, when his\r\nworthy master King James had fled to France, slunk in disguise to\r\nLeatherhead. It was one of the many roads he found closed against him in\r\nhis attempts to escape. But he did not come to Leatherhead solely\r\nbecause it lay on the road to the south. His little daughter lay at the\r\npoint of death at her uncle's house, and his desire was to see her once\r\nmore before she died. The once mighty Lord Chancellor, dressed as a\r\ncommon sailor with shaven eyebrows and coaldust smeared on his cheeks,\r\nhated with a furious intensity of loathing which has never been felt for\r\nan Englishman before or since, knocked fearfully at dead of night at the\r\ndoor of the house where his dying daughter lay. So says the legend, and\r\nhistory does not forbid belief. For the register dates the child's\r\nfuneral on December 2, 1688, and it was ten days afterwards that a wild\r\ncrowd nearly tore the judge limb from limb at Wapping.\r\n\r\nA gentler memory, or rather association, belongs to the Church street\r\nand the houses in the neighbourhood. There have been many attempts made\r\nby Miss Austen's readers to identify Highbury, \"the large and populous\r\nvillage, almost amounting to a town\" of _Emma_, with some Surrey town or\r\nvillage. There is a school of serious students who place it at Esher;\r\nanother band of enthusiasts support Dorking. Mr. E.V. Lucas, in his\r\nengaging introduction to a new edition of the novel, has another\r\nsuggestion. He recommends the theory that Highbury was Leatherhead,\r\nwhich satisfies most of the conditions of the book. It is, as he says,\r\nrightly placed as regards London, Kingston and Box Hill; though seven\r\nmiles, which was the drive from Hartfield to Box Hill, is surely rather\r\na generous estimate of the actual distance. But Leatherhead certainly\r\nhas a river and a \"Randalls,\" and Mr. Lucas has been told that it has an\r\n\"Abbey Farm.\" That may be a mere coincidence; but, if so, it is the more\r\nstriking when one turns to the parish registers, and finds in them the\r\nuncommon name of Knightley. Mr. Knightley, in 1761, raised the pulpit of\r\nthe church, and erected a new reading-desk and seat for the clerk, and\r\nit was \"hereby ordered that the thanks of this vestry be paid in the\r\nmost respectful manner to Mr. Knightley for this fresh mark of his\r\nregard.\" Surely that is precisely what would have been the attitude of\r\nMr. Elton's parishioners to Emma's husband. If Miss Austen read the\r\nparish literature, she may also have set eyes on a poem entitled,\r\n\"Norbury Park,\" which was written by a minor bard of the neighbourhood\r\nnamed Woodhouse. But that is insisting too much; though, to be sure,\r\nfrom the quality of his verse, Mr. Woodhouse, author of \"Norbury Park,\"\r\nmay well be imagined to have had, like Emma's father, a nice taste in\r\ngruel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mole at Slyfield Place._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nSTOKE D'ABERNON\r\n\r\n    Slyfields.--A Great Bowl of Silver.--The Heir.--The Danger of Parish\r\n    Relief.--Stoke D'Abernon Church.--A Knightly Memorial.--Stolen\r\n    Woad.--Sire Richard le Petit.--Long Sermons.--The Earliest\r\n    Honeymoon.--Cobham.--A Hermit for L700.--Matthew Arnold at Pain's\r\n    Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole wanders west away from Leatherhead by Randall's Farm and\r\nRandall's Park, and perhaps Miss Austen used to imagine Emma and Mrs.\r\nWeston walking along the rather dull road that runs up the valley by the\r\nside of the stream. North of the road, about a mile from the town,\r\nstands an old Roman camp, now buried in a small wood, with notice-boards\r\nloudly forbidding access. Another mile to the west--but you must walk\r\ntwo to get there--is one of the most charming of old Surrey\r\nmanor-houses, now a farmhouse, but still known by its name of Slyfields.\r\n\r\nThe Slyfields were essentially a Surrey family. They lived and worked as\r\ngentlemen and yeomen and parsons among small Surrey villages, Send and\r\nGreat Bookham and Byfleet and Pirford and Ripley and the Clandons; one\r\nof them, Edmond, was Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in the time of\r\nElizabeth. He was the greatest of the Slyfields, and left behind him\r\nsixteen sons and daughters, four Surrey manors, and a will as careful\r\nand studious as himself. Some of the items are quaint reading:--\r\n\r\n    To his son Walter, \"my black velvett dublett and paire of hose of\r\n    wrought velvet, my best night gowne, my best hatt, fower of my best\r\n    shirtes and my best riding Cloake.\"\r\n\r\n    To his son William, \"my coate of Tuftaffatie and a shorte cloke of\r\n    rashe, laide with parchment lace.\"\r\n\r\n    To his son-in-law, Edward Skeete, \"one shorte Cloake, called the\r\n    Dutch cloke, of Black Damaske furred with squirrell, faced with\r\n    caliber, and garded with velvett.\"\r\n\r\n    To Elizabeth, his eldest daughter, L40, \"but she not to troble\r\n    molest or disquiett my saide wyfe, her mother, my executrix.\"\r\n\r\n    To his grandson Edmond one of his great bowls of silver.\r\n\r\nThe last item is one of the most interesting. It ought to be read in\r\nconjunction with an earlier item in the same will, in which special\r\ndirections are left to the executors not to pull down or to deface any\r\nmanner of wainscot or glass in or about the house of Slyfield. For the\r\nend of the Slyfield family as a power in Surrey came with bitter\r\nsuddenness. Henry, the Sheriff's eldest son, succeeded his father in\r\n1590, and died in 1598. He was succeeded by his son Edmond, who had been\r\nleft one of the \"great bowls of silver.\" Within sixteen years Edmond\r\nSlyfield had sold every stick and stone of the Slyfield manors, the\r\nSlyfield house was razed to the ground to make room for a new building,\r\nand in the new building and on the old tombstones alone the name of\r\nSlyfield remains.\r\n\r\nThe new manor-house is nearly three hundred years old, and was built for\r\nthe possessor of another great Surrey name, George Shiers. He was the\r\ngrandfather of Sir George Shiers, baronet, who was one of the most\r\ngenerous of testators to Surrey villages. Among other bequests, he left\r\na sum of money to the parish of Great Bookham, which was to be thus\r\ndevoted:--\r\n\r\n    In preferring in Marriage such Maids born in this Parish as have\r\n    lived and behaved themselves well for seven Years in any one\r\n    Service, and whose friends are not able to do it.\r\n\r\n    To dispose of the surplus to such Poor as by Sickness, Age, a great\r\n    Family of Children, or otherwise, shall be in Danger of coming under\r\n    the common relief of this Parish.\r\n\r\nThe \"danger of coming under the common relief\" of the parish was\r\nevidently felt to be real--a strange dislike forerunning the hatred\r\nwhich the modern English villager feels for \"the House.\" When Louise\r\nMichel, the leader of the _petroleuses_ of the French Revolution, was\r\nshown over one of the great London Unions not long before her death, she\r\nwas filled with wonder and admiration. \"If we had had _that_ in France,\"\r\nshe said, \"we should have had no revolution.\" The Englishman leaves\r\nlegacies to enable poor parishioners to escape from the danger.\r\n\r\nSlyfields Manor, picturesque though it is, is still only a remnant. Only\r\none side of what was once a quadrangular building remains, but the solid\r\nsymmetry of its red-brick walls and ivied gables, and the hugeness of\r\nits ornate and lichened barns and granaries, make it as imposing as any\r\nfarmhouse well could be. Curiously enough, like the older Crowhurst\r\nPlace, the other side of the county, a farmhouse it still remains.\r\n\r\nThe Slyfields and the Shiers lie in Great Bookham church. Another church\r\nstands not half a mile away from the house, in a smooth and green garden\r\non the banks of the Mole. Stoke D'Abernon church contains one of the\r\ngreat possessions of Surrey--the oldest brass in England--a monument\r\nwhich, besides being the oldest of its kind, is the very knightliest\r\nmemorial an English gentleman could have. A plain slab of brass, on\r\nwhich has been elaborately engraved the figure of a soldier in full\r\nchain mail, with his six-foot lance and its fringed pennon, his long\r\nprick-spurs, and his great two-handed sword, it has lain in an English\r\nchurch for nearly six centuries and a-half. The Lombardic lettering\r\nwhich runs round the brass is half illegible, but the form of the old\r\ninscription, perfect in its simple dignity, is clear enough:--\r\n\r\n    SIRE : IOHAN : DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER : GIST : ICY :\r\n    DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT : MERCY.\r\n\r\nBy Sir John D'Abernon's brass lies that of his son, and between the\r\ndates of the two brasses are fifty years--1277 and 1327. The D'Abernons\r\nwere a knightly family, but they never provided an English king with a\r\ngreat soldier, or a great politician, or with anything much more than\r\nthe quiet services of a country gentleman. The founder of the family in\r\nEngland was Roger de Abernun, who in Domesday Book is a tenant of\r\nRichard de Bienfaite, son of Gilbert Count of Brionne. The first Sir\r\nJohn D'Abernon, whose brass lies in Stoke D'Abernon church, was the most\r\ndistinguished of the family. Like Edmond Slyfield, he was Sheriff of\r\nSurrey and Sussex.\r\n\r\nEdmond Slyfield, dead three hundred years before our day (we can see his\r\nbrass in Great Bookham church), perhaps often stared at the brass of Sir\r\nJohn D'Abernon, dead three hundred years before him. Perhaps, little\r\nguessing that within thirty years the Slyfield manors would belong to a\r\nstranger, and the Slyfield name be half forgotten, he reflected\r\ncomfortably on the misfortunes of his predecessor in office. For Sir\r\nJohn was a most unlucky Sheriff, and lost a large sum partly by robbery\r\nand partly in the law courts. The story of his loss is a strange medley.\r\nOne William Hod, of Normandy, in the year 1265 shipped to Portsmouth ten\r\nhogsheads of woad. Robbers seized the woad at Portsmouth and carried it\r\noff to Guildford; Hod, pursuing, recaptured his hogsheads and lodged\r\nthem in Guildford Castle. Immediately appeared Nicholas Picard and\r\nothers from Normandy, demanding the woad in the name of Stephen Buckarel\r\nand others. If the woad was not given up, they threatened to destroy the\r\nwhole of Guildford by fire the next morning. The under-sheriff, whose\r\nfamily lived in the neighbourhood, at once gave up the woad, whereupon\r\nHod instituted proceedings against Sir John D'Abernon the Sheriff, and\r\nwon his case. Sir John had to pay as damages six score marks--about\r\nequivalent to L900 of our money.\r\n\r\nStoke D'Abernon church holds a number of other interesting monuments and\r\nbrasses; indeed, for its size, it is fuller of valuable work and\r\nmemorials than any other Surrey church. One of them, placed to the\r\nmemory of \"Sir Richard the Little, formerly parson of this church,\" has\r\na haunting note of personal loss. It is a pleasure to puzzle out the old\r\nNorman-French:--\r\n\r\n    SIRE RICHARD LE PETIT IADIS PERSONE DE CEST EIGLISE ICI GIST RECEYVE\r\n    LA ALME IESU CHRIST.\r\n\r\nAnother rare form of brass is that of a little chrysom child, Ellen\r\nBray; another, a curious engraving of Lady Anne Norbury, with four tiny\r\nsons and four tiny daughters gathered at her feet in the folds of her\r\ngown. There are imposing monuments to Sir Thomas and Lady Vincent, Sir\r\nThomas enormous in trunk hose and his Lady with her hair elaborately\r\nfrizzed in a Paris hood. In the body of the church, the pulpit is a\r\nmagnificent piece of early seventeenth century carving, and to the wall\r\nnear it is fastened a wrought-iron hour-glass, which must have measured\r\nmany a weary discourse. Another of Stoke D'Abernon's possessions is one\r\nof the finest thirteenth century oak chests in the southern counties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Stoke D'Abernon Church._]\r\n\r\nOutside, the church is interesting in other ways. You can see in the\r\nsouth wall of the chancel a large slice of Roman herringbone brickwork,\r\nperhaps brought by pre-conquest builders from some villa or other ruins\r\nclose at hand; and on the south wall of the nave, high up, is a sundial\r\nwhich before the conquest probably stood above the old south door. With\r\nso much that is old and venerable in the building and its monuments it\r\nis dismal to add that much, also, that was old and venerable has been\r\ndestroyed. It is probably the worst restored of all old churches worth\r\nrestoring.\r\n\r\nStoke D'Abernon has a claim on the attention of those about to marry.\r\nThe manor-house is the first which is recorded as having been lent for a\r\nhoneymoon. So I learn from Mr. J.H. Round, writing in the _Ancestor_.\r\nWhen William Marshall, in 1189, secured the hand of the heiress of the\r\nEarls of Pembroke, who was as good as she was beautiful, he proposed\r\nthat they should be married on her own estates on the Welsh border. His\r\nhost, however, a wealthy Londoner, would not hear of such a thing, and\r\ninsisted on their being married in London and paying the cost of the\r\nwedding himself. After the ceremony, as the Society papers of the time\r\nmight have put it, the young couple left for Stoke D'Abernon in Surrey,\r\nthe peaceful and delectable country mansion of Sir Enguerrand D'Abernon,\r\nkindly lent for the occasion. Mr. Round has extracted this the earliest\r\nknown reference to an orthodox honeymoon in the country, from the\r\nbridegroom's poetical biography, _L'histoire de Guillaume le\r\nMarechal_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quant les noces bien faites furent,\r\n    E richement, si comme els durent,\r\n    La dame emmena, ce savon,\r\n    Chies sire Angeran d'Abernon,\r\n    A Estokes, en liu paisable\r\n    E aesie e delitable.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill for the trousseau of the heiress has also been discovered,\r\nentered in the Pipe Roll of the year. It cost L9 12_s._ 1_d._\r\n\r\nThe road from Stoke D'Abernon runs north-west through the two Cobhams,\r\nChurch Cobham and Street Cobham. The little Plough Inn, which acts as\r\nrefreshment-room for Cobham railway station, suggests the proper spirit\r\nof village revelry. A spreading yew arbour should shade good ale from\r\nthe summer suns, and by the side of the garden across the road, gay with\r\ngeraniums, see-saws and swings, runs a tiny stream, rippling down to the\r\nMole.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Wey, the Mole runs by few churches. Only five, Horley,\r\nBetchworth, Leatherhead, Stoke D'Abernon, and Cobham, stand near the\r\nriver, and only Stoke D'Abernon actually on its banks. Stoke D'Abernon,\r\ntoo, has the best view from the churchyard across the stream, over a\r\nbroad stretch of grassland on which partridges call and rooks stalk\r\nmajestically. At Cobham you can scarcely see the Mole when you are in\r\nthe village, but there are few prettier glimpses of its stream than the\r\nbrimming pool by the road outside. A grey mill stands in the stream,\r\ndouble-wheeled and doubly silent; swans oar themselves leisurely about\r\nthe eddies, and the meadow beyond in May is a sheet of kingcups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ye Old Church Stile House, Cobham_, A.D. 1432,\r\n_restored_ 1635.]\r\n\r\n\"Ye Old Church Stile House, Cobham, 1432, restored 1635,\" is the\r\nengaging legend painted on a low-roofed timbered house which stands at\r\nthe churchyard gate. With its square beams, its latticed windows and red\r\ncurtains, it is a model of what a \"Home of Rest for Gentlewomen\"--which\r\nis its vocation--should be. Cobham has one or two other good houses,\r\nGeorgian, red and solid, but the best perhaps is the old White Lion\r\nposting inn at Cobham Street, half a mile away on the Portsmouth Road.\r\nThe White Lion stood by the fourth tollhouse on the highway from London,\r\nand its oak-panelled parlours have entertained travellers for four\r\ncenturies or more--none thirstier, perhaps, than \"Liberty\" Wilkes, who\r\npassed that way on a day in 1794, and drank \"a large bowl of lemonade.\"\r\n\r\nPain's Hill, which rises above the Mole a little further on the road, is\r\na name associated with a gardener and a poet. The gardener was Charles\r\nHamilton, who burdened his lawns with such an astonishing variety of\r\ntemples, chapels, grottos, castles, cascades and ruins--including a\r\nhermitage with a real live hermit--that the result was voted one of the\r\ngreatest achievements in landscape gardening of the Georgian or any\r\nother age. The hermit, sad to relate, was a failure. He was offered L700\r\nto live a Nebuchadnezzar-like existence in his cell, sleeping on a mat,\r\nnever speaking a word, and abandoning all the conveniences of a toilet.\r\nHe would gladly have taken the L700, but threw up his post after three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThe poet was Matthew Arnold, who spent most of the last fifteen years of\r\nhis life at Pain's Hill Cottage. He wrote little poetry there; he came\r\nto Pain's Hill in the year after he had published _Literature and\r\nDogma_, when his mind was occupied with his revolution against the\r\nsombreness and narrowness of modern English religious thought. But to\r\nPain's Hill, I think, belong \"Geist's Grave\" and \"Kaiser Dead\" and \"Poor\r\nMatthias;\" \"Geist's Grave\" written for his little son, and \"Poor\r\nMatthias\" for his daughter, perhaps--Matthias, bought at Hastings to\r\nplease a child, though she, childlike, would have chosen a bigger\r\nbird:--\r\n\r\n                    \"Behold\r\n    French canary-merchant old\r\n    Shepherding his flock of gold\r\n    In a low dim-lighted pen\r\n    Scann'd of tramps and fishermen!\r\n    There a bird, high-coloured, fat,\r\n    Proud of port, though something squat--\r\n    Pursy, play'd-out Philistine--\r\n    Dazzled Nelly's youthful eyne.\r\n    But, far in, obscure, there stirr'd\r\n    On his perch a sprightlier bird,\r\n    Courteous-eyed, erect and slim;\r\n    And I whisper'd: 'Fix on _him!_'\r\n    Home we brought him, young and fair,\r\n    Songs to trill in Surrey air.\r\n    Here Matthias sang his fill,\r\n    Saw the cedars of Pain's Hill;\r\n    Here he pour'd his little soul,\r\n    Heard the murmur of the Mole.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was while Matthew Arnold was living at Pain's Hill that he chose\r\nout his little collection of \"selected poems.\" I like to think of him\r\nreading over his work in his Surrey garden, and answering once more the\r\ncuckoo calling \"from the wet field, through the vext garden-trees\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?\r\n      Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come on,\r\n        Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,\r\n      Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,\r\n        Sweet William with his homely cottage smell,\r\n          And stocks in fragrant blow:\r\n        Roses that down the alleys shine afar,\r\n          And open, jasmined-muffled lattices,\r\n          And groups under the dreaming garden trees,\r\n        And the full moon, and the white evening star.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bridge over the Mole, Cobham._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nLEATHERHEAD TO DORKING\r\n\r\n    The Roman road over the hill.--The Swallows of the Mole.--An\r\n    imperial draught.--Mickleham.--Fanny Burney.--A Story of\r\n    letters.--Juniper Hall and its cedars.--Norbury Park.--How to\r\n    measure trout from the Mole.--Conversation Sharp.--Keats and\r\n    Endymion.--Mr. George Meredith's poems.--The best known hill in the\r\n    world.--A Soldier's Whim.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way from Leatherhead to Dorking is the longest, and hardly goes\r\nby the high road at all. It begins at Ashtead; you can get to Ashtead\r\nfrom Leatherhead or Epsom, but you must start from Ashtead out over\r\nErmyn Street, the old Roman road. One might begin the walk from Epsom;\r\nbut Epsom downs, with the great empty race-stand, can be depressing, and\r\nthe best of the old road lies south, nearer Mickleham.\r\n\r\nAshtead is growing towards the railway, but east of the main street\r\nthere is hardly a cottage. The church stands in Ashtead Park, and shows\r\nthat it once had Roman walls for neighbours by the quantity of Roman\r\nbrick and tiling mixed among its flints and stones. It has been\r\nelaborately roofed with cedar, but otherwise contains little; the\r\nprettiest part is the churchyard and the park beyond it, with its deer\r\nwhich walk by the gates and gaze gently over the paths at strangers.\r\n\r\nErmyn Street or Stane Street of the maps, which English tongues here\r\nhave named Pebble Lane, skirts Ashtead Park by the south-east, at first\r\na wide green lane, afterwards a narrow path sometimes half-choked by\r\ntrees, sometimes, in wet weather, impassable with mud, but always\r\ndriving straight as the Roman roadmaker drove his pick towards the cap\r\nof Mickleham Downs. The narrow lane to which the road has shrunk is less\r\nthan the Roman made it, but Mickleham Downs can look very little\r\ndifferent to-day from the downs which the legionary knew. He, too, like\r\nthe modern traveller tramping by the yews and box trees, saw the\r\nsunlight on the dark, shining leaves, and watched the wind ruffle the\r\nwhitebeams on the shoulder of the hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mickleham Church._]\r\n\r\nBelow the downs lies Mickleham, halfway between Leatherhead and Dorking,\r\nand famous in all the guide-books for the \"swallows\" of the Mole. The\r\n\"swallows\" are described as deep, blue pools, into which the Mole\r\ndisappears underground, and, except from the most carefully written\r\naccounts, you would imagine that the whole river dives completely into\r\nthe earth and jumps up again at Leatherhead. But if you ask at Mickleham\r\nto be directed to the \"Swallows,\" the chances are that you will have to\r\nexplain that you do not mean birds. The fact is that it is only in\r\nseasons of great drought that they would be noticed. In summers when\r\nthere is very little rain the Mole is said to run dry between Burford\r\nBridge and Thorncroft Bridge near Leatherhead, but I have never happened\r\nto see it do so, and had the greatest difficulty in discovering the\r\nSwallows, which, when I saw them, were brimming with very muddy water;\r\nthe stream was as full as possible. The best comment on the legend of\r\nthe diving Mole is Thomas Fuller's in the _Worthies_:--\r\n\r\n    \"I listen not to the country people telling it was experimented by a\r\n    goose, which was put in and came out again with _life_ (though\r\n    without feathers); but hearken seriously to those who judiciously\r\n    impute the _subsidency_ of the earth in the interstice aforesaid to\r\n    some underground hollowness made by that water in the passage\r\n    thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe Swallows are really fissures in the chalk bed of the stream, which\r\nruns as it were over the top of a long chalk sponge. In rainless summers\r\nthere is only enough water to fill the bottom of the sponge, and the top\r\nchannel runs dry. Brayley has some amusing calculations as to the amount\r\nof water which the sponge drinks:--\r\n\r\n    \"From calculations made on different days, after measuring the\r\n    height and velocity of the current received into these pools, it was\r\n    ascertained, when both were in activity, that the swallows of the\r\n    outer pool engulphed 72 imperial gallons per second, 4,320 per\r\n    minute, and 259,200 per hour; and those of the inner pool, 23\r\n    imperial gallons per second, 1,380 per minute, and 82,800 per hour.\"\r\n\r\nSeventy-two gallons--a good-sized tankful--of water in a second is very\r\npretty swallowing; an early instance of thinking imperially. To Camden,\r\nin the _Britannia_, the disappearing water suggests another image. The\r\ninhabitants can boast, like the Spaniards, of having a bridge that\r\nfeeds several flocks of sheep.\r\n\r\nMickleham is almost the centre of the Fanny Burney country. At Mickleham\r\nchurch she was married to General d'Arblay; Juniper Hall is half-a-mile\r\nfrom the church; Norbury Park lies west of the Mole; Camilla Lacey south\r\nof Norbury Park at West Humble.\r\n\r\nFanny Burney, retired from her post of Maid of Honour and receiving a\r\npension of L100 a year, met M. d'Arblay in January, 1793, when she was\r\nstaying with her friends the Locks at Norbury Park. He was living at\r\nJuniper Hall with other French _emigres_--a brilliant little colony;\r\nMadame de Stael was there, and de Narbonne, and de Lally Tollendal, and\r\nTalleyrand. The General began as tutor, and the course of Fanny Burney's\r\nacquaintance with Juniperians, as her sister Mrs. Phillips used to call\r\nthem, and particularly with her French master, perhaps may be given in a\r\nfew extracts from her correspondence:--\r\n\r\n    MADAME DE STAEL HOLSTEIN TO MISS BURNEY,\r\n\r\n    _Written from_ JUNIPER HALL, DORKING, SURREY, 1793.\r\n\r\n    \"When J learned to read english J begun by milton, to know all or\r\n    renounce all in once. J follow the same system in writing my first\r\n    english letter to Miss burney; after such an enterprize nothing can\r\n    affright me. J feel for her so tender a friendship that it melts my\r\n    admiration, inspires my heart with hope of her indulgence, and\r\n    impresses me with the idea that in a tongue even unknown J could\r\n    express sentiments so deeply felt.\r\n\r\n    \"My servant will return for a french answer. J intreat miss burney\r\n    to correct the words but to preserve the sense of that card.\r\n\r\n    \"Best compliments to my dear protectress, Madame Phillipe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    MISS BURNEY TO DR. BURNEY (her father).\r\n\r\n    \"MICKLEHAM, _February 29, 1793_.\r\n\r\n    \"There can be nothing imagined more charming, more fascinating than\r\n    this colony; between their sufferings and their _agremens_ they\r\n    occupy us almost wholly.

With all this, which is his\r\n    military portion, he is passionately fond of literature, a most\r\n    delicate critic in his own language, well versed in both Italian and\r\n    German, and a very elegant poet. He has just undertaken to become my\r\n    French master for pronunciation, and he gives me long daily lessons\r\n    in reading. Pray expect wonderful improvements!

You must\r\n    have observed my silent gravity, surpassing that of mere illness and\r\n    its consequent low spirits. I had some thoughts of writing to Susan\r\n    about it, and intended begging her to do what I must now do for\r\n    myself--that is, beg, warn, and admonish you not to entangle\r\n    yourself in a wild and romantic attachment which offers nothing in\r\n    prospect but poverty and distress, with future inconvenience and\r\n    unhappiness....\"\r\n\r\n    FROM MADAME D'ARBLAY TO MRS. ----.\r\n\r\n    \"_August 2, 1793._\r\n\r\n    \"Last Sunday (July 28) M^r and M^rs Lock, my sister and Captain\r\n    Phillips, and my brother Captain Burney, accompanied us to the altar\r\n    in Mickleham Church; since which the ceremony has been repeated in\r\n    the chapel of the Sardinian Ambassador, that if, by a\r\n    counter-revolution in France, M. d'Arblay recovers any of his\r\n    rights, his wife may not be excluded from their participation.\r\n\r\n    \"You may be amazed not to see the name of my dear father upon this\r\n    solemn occasion; but his apprehensions from the smallness of our\r\n    income have made him cold and averse: and though he granted his\r\n    consent, I could not even solicit his presence.\"\r\n\r\n    FROM MADAME D'ARBLAY TO DR. BURNEY AFTER HIS FIRST VISIT TO HER AT\r\n    BOOKHAM.\r\n\r\n    \"BOOKHAM, _August '94_.\r\n\r\n    It is just a week since I had the greatest gratification of its kind\r\n    I ever, I think, experienced:--so kind a thought, so sweet a\r\n    surprise as was my dearest father's visit! How softly and soothingly\r\n    it has rested upon my mind ever since!...\r\n\r\n    \"How thankfully did I look back, the 28^th of last month, upon a\r\n    year that has not been blemished with one regretful moment!\"\r\n\r\nIt was at Bookham that Madame d'Arblay wrote _Camilla_, and out of the\r\nsale of the novel she built her cottage, Camilla Lacey, on a plot of\r\nground at West Humble leased to her by her friend Mr. Lock. _Camilla_,\r\nwhich Horace Walpole thought deplorable, infinitely worse than\r\n_Cecilia_, which was not so good as _Evelina_, was an instant success.\r\nWithin a month Madame d'Arblay had made L2,000, and Macaulay's estimate\r\nof her whole profits was over three thousand guineas. There was never a\r\nstranger climb down a ladder to fortune than Fanny Burney's. _Evelina_,\r\nher first and incomparably her best novel, brought her L30; _Cecilia_,\r\nher next, L250; then came _Camilla_; and her last novel, _The Wanderer_,\r\nwhich she wrote after ten years' absence with her husband in France,\r\nactually sold 3,600 copies in six months at two guineas a copy, and was\r\nan absolute and hopeless failure.\r\n\r\nCamilla Lacey, invisible from the road, has been enlarged and altered to\r\nlook like nothing the d'Arblays knew. Juniper Hall has also changed, but\r\nthe splendid cedars which stand round its lawns must have been familiar\r\nto Talleyrand and Madame de Stael. They have grown curiously slowly;\r\nthey do not strike one as larger than many trees which are known to be\r\nnot more than a hundred and twenty years old--those, for instance, at\r\nFarnham Castle; but John Timbs, in his _Promenade Round Dorking_,\r\nwritten in 1823, speaks of them as \"immense,\" and as \"said to be of the\r\nfinest growth in England.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cedars at Juniper Hall._]\r\n\r\nNorbury Park also has its famous trees. The Druids' Walk, a path running\r\nunder enormous yews, is no longer open to the public. But Louis\r\nJennings, thirty years ago, saw the trees and preserved a memory of\r\nthem in _Field Paths and Green Lanes_:--\r\n\r\n    \"As the path descends the shadows deepen, and you arrive at a spot\r\n    where a mass of yews of great size and vast age stretch up the hill,\r\n    and beyond to the left as far as the eye can penetrate through the\r\n    obscurity. The trees in their long and slow growth have assumed many\r\n    wild forms, and the visitor who stands there towards evening, and\r\n    peers into that sombre grove, will sometimes yield to the spell\r\n    which the scene is sure to exercise on imaginative natures; he will\r\n    half fancy that these ghostly trees are conscious creatures, and\r\n    that they have marked with mingled pity and scorn the long\r\n    processions of mankind come and go like the insects of a day,\r\n    through the centuries during which they have been stretching out\r\n    their distorted limbs nearer and nearer to each other. Thick fibrous\r\n    shoots spring out from their trunks, awakening in the memory\r\n    long-forgotten stories of huge hairy giants, enemies of mankind even\r\n    as the \"double-fatal\" yew itself was supposed to be in other days.\r\n    The bark stands in distinct layers, the outer ridges mouldering\r\n    away, like the fragments of a wall of some ruined castle. The tops\r\n    are fresh and green, but all below in that sunless recess seems\r\n    dead.\"\r\n\r\nIn another respect Norbury Park has changed--in the opportunities the\r\nMole running through the park offers to anglers wishing to catch large\r\ntrout. Mr. C.J. Swete, writing in his _Handbook of Epsom_, not longer\r\nago than 1853, is pleased to take his reader with him by the banks of\r\nthe Mole, in which he has obtained \"permission from the proprietor to\r\ngather some of the finny treasures of its liquid mines.\" Quite\r\nunwarrantably, he assumes that his reader is no fisherman:--\r\n\r\n    \"Well, now, cast out your line, you have a respectable cast, for\r\n    here the river is broad, you can scarce cast your line across it.\r\n    Well, you must be a little patient,--You cannot expect to catch a\r\n    fish the moment you throw in.... I see you are not a great\r\n    proficient at the piscatory science. Cast out very little line at\r\n    first, perhaps about the length of your rod, and then increasing by\r\n    degrees, you will soon be able to throw full across and with\r\n    precision. Ah! now you have a fine fish; let him down the stream a\r\n    little. Now bring him close to the shore. Stay! It is safer to land\r\n    him with the net. For this stream it is a very excellent fish,\r\n    exactly three pounds weight, I find. How do I know it is just three\r\n    pounds? I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to do so. He knows because he has measured the fish and\r\nfinds him nineteen inches long by ten in girth, and if you do the sum\r\nhis way, it works out at three pounds. \"This is in accordance, as you\r\nsuppose, with the mathematical law that similar solids are to each other\r\nin the triplicate ratio of one of their dimensions.\" That is the way to\r\nmeasure trout in Norbury Park.\r\n\r\nTwo quaintly spelt epitaphs can be read on the black marble tombstones\r\nin Mickleham Church. Under one lies the body of Peter de la Hay, \"Eldest\r\nYeoman of his Majesties Confectionary Office, who Departed this Liee\" in\r\n1684, and under the other Thomas Tooth, \"Yeaman of his Ma^ties Sculery,\r\nwho deceased this Life\" a year later.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite Juniper Hall is Fredley Farm, once the home of\r\n\"Conversation\" Sharp, hat-maker, poet and member of Parliament. Fredley\r\nFarm, in the years between 1797 and 1835, when Sharp lived there, must\r\nhave been visited by more distinguished poets, authors, politicians,\r\nwits, scholars and artists than any other house in Surrey. Wordsworth\r\ncame there, and Scott, Coleridge, Campbell, Southey and Moore; he talked\r\npainting with Lawrence, and sculpture with Chantrey; Macaulay talked\r\nwith him \"about everything and everybody,\" and so did Grote and Mill and\r\nLockhart and Jeffrey; Porson was there, and perhaps had his favourite\r\nporter for breakfast; and the politicians were without number--Brougham,\r\nSheridan, Grattan, Talleyrand, Huskisson, and almost a link with to-day,\r\nLord John Russell. Macaulay has left a few sentences which greater men\r\nthan Sharp might not deserve as an epitaph: \"One thing I have observed\r\nin Sharp, which is quite peculiar to him among town-wits and diners-out.\r\nHe never talks scandal. If he can say nothing good of a man, he holds\r\nhis tongue.\" Yet with all his virtues and all his conversation, Sharp\r\nlacks his Boswell.\r\n\r\nA little further towards Dorking the road crosses the Mole at Burford\r\nBridge. The inn at Burford Bridge, a sort of Swindon of the Dorking\r\nRoad, where everybody stops to have lunch or dinner, perhaps will again\r\nwelcome a great admiral and finish a great poem. Nelson stayed there\r\nbefore leaving to command at Trafalgar; Keats came there to finish\r\n_Endymion_. His visit, he writes to his friend Benjamin Bailey, is \"to\r\nchange the scene--change the air, and give me a spur to wind up my poem,\r\nof which there are wanting about 500 lines.\" Night on the hill inspired\r\nhim; in another letter he shows the way for other poets: \"I went up Box\r\nHill this evening after the moon--'you a' seen the moon'--came down and\r\nwrote some lines.\" And it is of the inn at Burford Bridge that the story\r\nis told, by Mortimer Collins, in his \"Walk through Surrey,\" of Keats and\r\nthe waiter. Keats was reciting _Endymion_:--\r\n\r\n    \"For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;\r\n    For wine we left our heath and yellow brooms,\r\n            And cold mushrooms;\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter heard, and obeyed, bringing mushrooms uncooked on a plate and\r\na decanter of sherry. But that story is a little too artificial.\r\n\r\nStill, _Endymion_ owes a good deal to the trees and the solitude of the\r\nhill above Burford Bridge. It was with the woods in his memory that\r\nKeats wrote something very like a description of Box Hill, with the Mole\r\nbelow it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow\r\n    Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun\r\n    Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;\r\n    And where dark yew trees as we rustle through,\r\n    Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?\r\n    O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;\r\n    Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace\r\n    Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:\r\n    For by one step the blue sky should'st thou find,\r\n    And by another in deep dell below,\r\n    See, through the trees, a little river go\r\n    All in its midday gold and glimmering.\"\r\n\r\nBut the great poet and novelist of Box Hill came later. Mr. George\r\nMeredith lived his long life and died at last, on May 18, 1909, at his\r\nhouse, Flint Cottage, near Burford Bridge. It was by Box Hill that he\r\nimagined the gayest and wisest of novels and some of the most glorious\r\nof all English poetry. Here, in his chalet looking out over the Surrey\r\nhills, he wrote _The Thrush in February_:--\r\n\r\n    \"I know him, February's thrush,\r\n    And loud at eve he valentines\r\n    On sprays that paw the naked bush\r\n    Where soon will sprout the thorns and bines.\r\n\r\n    Now ere the foreign singer thrills\r\n    Our vale his plain-song pipe he pours\r\n    A herald of the million bills;\r\n    And heed him not, the loss is yours.\r\n\r\n    My study, flanked with ivied fir\r\n    And budded beech with dry leaves curled,\r\n    Perched over yew and juniper,\r\n    He neighbours, piping to the world:--\r\n\r\n    The wooded pathways dank on brown,\r\n    The branches on grey cloud a web,\r\n    The long green roller of the down,\r\n    An image of the deluge-ebb:\"--\r\n\r\nThe lines ring with the bird's song; the light of all February evenings\r\nis on the hill. But if you are to take the heart of the poem, you must\r\nchoose the last eight lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"For love we Earth, then serve we all;\r\n    Her mystic secret then is ours:\r\n    We fall, or view our treasures fall,\r\n    Unclouded, as beholds her flowers.\r\n\r\n    Earth, from a night of frosty wreck,\r\n    Enrobed in morning's mounted fire,\r\n    When lowly, with a broken neck,\r\n    The crocus lays her cheek to mire.\"\r\n\r\nThe noblest philosophy of poetry belongs to this Surrey hill, and so\r\ndoes the most wonderful love-song of its century, the long, enchanted\r\ncadences of _Love in the Valley_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping\r\n      Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star.\r\n    Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-note unvaried,\r\n      Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown evejar.\r\n    Darker grows the valley, more and more forgetting:\r\n      So were it with me if forgetting could be willed.\r\n    Tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well-spring,\r\n      Tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled.\"\r\n\r\nBox Hill must be pretty nearly the best-known hill in the world. It has\r\nall the advantages. It is within easy reach of London for school treats,\r\nexcursions, choir outings, week-ends, and all other journeys in open\r\nair; it has a railway station at its foot, and several inns, and a\r\ntea-garden at the top, and a hundred Bank holidays have left it\r\nunspoiled. The box-trees that name the hill are the finest in England.\r\nBox-trees love chalk, and here they drive their roots into the crown and\r\nscar of a cliff of chalk, so steep on one side down to the Mole that a\r\nstone could almost be thrown from the path round the ridge into the\r\nwater. On the grass outside the box-grove the distance to the level\r\nvalley below deceives even more strangely. It looks as if you could\r\ndrive a golf ball straight from the hill on to the green; you may\r\nspeculate as to the beauty of the arc curved in the sunlight, and the\r\ndeadness with which the ball would lie after an absolutely perpendicular\r\ndrop--to the extreme danger of those disinterested in the experiment.\r\nBut the hill is not really steep enough. The contours crowd on the map,\r\nbut they show that you would have to drive nearly a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nAt a distance, in spring and summer, the trees which mark Box Hill are\r\nnot box or juniper, but the whitebeams that patch the deeper green of\r\nthe oaks and beeches with glaucous grey. The box-trees, though their\r\nthick, snaky stems look as if they might be any age, are not all of them\r\nold. The trees have more than once been cut and sold. Sir Henry Mildmay\r\nput them up for auction for L12,000 in 1795 and apparently sold them for\r\nL10,000 two years later, with twelve years to cut the wood in. In later\r\ndays, the wisdom of a War Office cleared a wide space of trees and built\r\na fort there; the wisdom of another War Office abandoned the fort as\r\nuseless. There it remains, behind spiked railings, the idlest monument\r\nof a whim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View of Box Hill, Misty Day._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dorking._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nDORKING\r\n\r\n    Mr. Stiggins at the Marquis of Granby--A Ruin.--The battle of\r\n    Dorking.--Real fighting.--The Table and Cellar.--Water-souchy, a\r\n    delicious dish.--Wild cherries.--Dorking snails.--Sandy kine.--Women\r\n    without roses.--Shrove Tuesday football.--Dorking's glory.--Jupp at\r\n    Cotmandene.--An earthquake.--Giant and Dwarf.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorking has twice had history made for it, and travellers come to visit\r\nthe scenes. It was in the bar of the Marquis of Granby at Dorking that\r\nSam Weller met his mother-in-law, and watched the reverend Mr. Stiggins\r\nmake toast and sip the pineapple rum and water, and advised Mr. Weller\r\nsenior as to the best method of treating Shepherds with cold water.\r\nPilgrims cross the Atlantic to visit the Marquis of Granby. No Dorking\r\ninn bears the name, nor ever has; but Americans will tell you that the\r\nMarquis is only a name Dickens invented to cover the identity of the\r\nWhite Horse, which fronts the cobbles of Dorking High Street with its\r\ngables and white and green paint much as it must have done in the time\r\nof Dickens. Dickens himself, in _All the Year Round_--he did not sign\r\nthe article, but in that paper none but he might have written of that\r\ninn--conceived \"the Markis\" to be the King's Head, in the old days a\r\ngreat coaching house on the Brighton Road. It stood at the corner of\r\nHigh Street and South Street, and in South Street to-day you may still\r\ngaze at its unhappy walls and windows. The old lattices are boarded up,\r\nsmashed with stones; the rooms are empty. When the post office came to\r\nstand at the corner, the King's Head became a tenement house; afterwards\r\na ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Dorking took place on the ridge north of the town in 1871,\r\nand resulted, after the invasion, in the conquest of Great Britain by\r\nGermany. It all came about perfectly simply. A rising in India had taken\r\naway part of our army; war with the United States over Canada had taken\r\nanother 10,000 troops, and half of what were left were dealing with a\r\nFenian revolution in Ireland. Germany put to sea and sank our fleet with\r\ntorpedoes, a new and dreadful engine of war; then the German army landed\r\nand the end came at once. At least, it would have come, if Sir George\r\nChesney, who described the battle of Dorking in _Blackwood's Magazine_,\r\nhad prophesied truly. He lived till 1895, to see more than twenty years\r\nafter his battle pass without an invasion; but the battle, for some of\r\nhis readers, became a very real thing. The late Louis Jennings, in his\r\n_Field Paths and Green Lanes_, tells us that he had a friend who,\r\nbelieving most people to have very hazy notions of history, was in the\r\nhabit of saying, \"Of course you remember the battle of Dorking? Well,\r\nthis was the very place where it was fought!\" He was seldom\r\ncontradicted.\r\n\r\nThe real history of Dorking has traditions of the table and the cellar.\r\nDorking fowls perhaps first came to the neighbourhood with the Romans,\r\nand poultry and Dorking have been associated ever since. The true\r\nDorking fowl is a large, well-feathered bird, and walks on five toes\r\ninstead of lesser fowls' four. He has always been a great fowl for the\r\ntable and historians have written about him since the days of\r\nColumella. Thus a contributor to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, in 1763:--\r\n\r\n    \"An incredible quantity of poultry is sold in Dorking, and it is\r\n    well known to the lovers of good eating for being remarkably large\r\n    and fine. I have seen capons about Christmas which weighed between\r\n    seven and eight pounds each out of their feathers, and were sold at\r\n    five shillings apiece; nor are the geese brought to the market here\r\n    about Michaelmas less excellent in their kind. The town is supplied\r\n    with sea-fish from Brighthelmstone and Worthing, in Sussex.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dorking._]\r\n\r\nThe Dorking cooks knew well what to do with the sea-fish when they got\r\nthem from Brighton. Dorking was famous for a particular way of making\r\nwater-souchy, a delicious dish of various fishes, of which Mr. J.L.\r\nAndre in the _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, has preserved the\r\nrecipe rescued from an 1833 cookery book 'by a Lady':--\r\n\r\n    \"Stew two or three flounders, some parsley roots and leaves, thirty\r\n    peppercorns, and a quart of water, till the fish are boiled to\r\n    pieces; pulp them through a sieve. Set over the fire the pulped\r\n    fish, the liquor that boiled them, some perch, tench, or flounders,\r\n    and some fresh roots or leaves of parsley; simmer all till done\r\n    enough, then serve in a deep dish. Slices of bread and butter are to\r\n    be sent to table to eat with the souchy.\"\r\n\r\nIt looks rather vague, but the \"Gentlemen's Dorking Club\" used to\r\nassemble every other Thursday from June to November to discuss the tench\r\nand flounders at the Red Lion, and the King's Head used even to attract\r\ndiners-out from London, especially Dutch merchants, who were\r\nparticularly fond of the admirable dish. Wine, too, was grown in the\r\ntown. There was a particular kind of wild cherry, of which Aubrey was\r\ntold by John Evelyn that it made a most excellent wine, little inferior\r\nto the French claret; it would even keep longer. With the cherry wine,\r\nperhaps, you would have eaten Dorking snails. They were large, white\r\nsnails, which some said were brought to the Downs by the pilgrims,\r\nothers thought were introduced from Italy by the Earl of Arundel, Lord\r\nMarshal of England; Lady Arundel used to cook and eat them. They roamed\r\nthe Downs by Box Hill and other chalky places, and are still to be found\r\nthere. Perhaps the Romans brought them, but they are not peculiar to\r\nSurrey and Sussex; I have found them on chalk in Hertfordshire, and I\r\nhave heard of them on the Cotswolds.\r\n\r\nSuch good fare should have built up the constitutions of Dorking people.\r\nBut it was not so in Aubrey's time, for he picks out the Dorking men and\r\nwomen as weaker and paler than others. He liked to see women with rosy\r\nfaces:--\r\n\r\n    \"Handsome women (viz. sanguine) as in Berks, Oxon, Somerset, &c. are\r\n    rare at this market; they have a mealy complexion, and something\r\n    hail like the French Picards; light grey eyed, and the kine\r\n    hereabout are of sandy colour, like those in Picardy. None\r\n    (especially those above the hill) have roses in their cheeks. The\r\n    men and women are not so strong or of so warm a complexion as in\r\n    Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, &c.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The White Horse, Dorking._]\r\n\r\nOne, at least, of the old customs of the town survived until very recent\r\nmemory. Now it has died out with the rest. From Mr. J.S. Bright's\r\n_History of Dorking_ I learn that the office of constable has lapsed;\r\nthe places of the 'Beggar-poker' and the 'Ale Taster' have been taken by\r\nthe local police. Parish funds are no longer dispensed at the close of\r\nchurch service. The poor on St. Thomas's Day used to go out 'Gooding';\r\nto-day they plead no more. The Ditchling Singers, which were the Dorking\r\nWaits, no longer keep Christmas. On the 29th of May, sacred to King\r\nCharles II of blessed memory, an oak bough used to hang from the church\r\ntower; the tower is bare throughout the year. Guy Fawkes has been burned\r\nfor the last time; the Jack in the Green dances no longer in cowslips\r\nand buttercups on the first of May. One ancient rite alone persisted\r\nuntil the other day. Every Shrove Tuesday, in dim remembrance of the\r\ngreat carnival which in ancient, pre-Reformation days, preceded the\r\nrigours of Lent, mummers made the circuit of the town. In the afternoon\r\nall the shops were shut and boarded up, and a game of football, started\r\nat the church gates, rioted up and down the main street. In the\r\n_Southern Weekly News_, an account describing the game of 1888 says that\r\njust before midday a procession of men grotesquely attired was formed,\r\nheaded by a man bearing three footballs on a triangular frame, over\r\nwhich was the motto:--\r\n\r\n    \"Kick away both Whig and Tory,\r\n    Wind and water Dorking's glory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Town Crier started the game, kicked off the first ball at two\r\no'clock, and stopped it at six. But that was in 1888. Twenty years have\r\nchanged the Crier's duties. Fines and the police have stopped the old\r\ncustom altogether.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the Dorking cricket ground at Cotmandene was hardly less\r\nwell known than the Oval. Two Dorking cricketers belong to the glorious\r\ndays of Cotmandene. Henry Jupp was born in the town, and Tom Humphrey at\r\nMitcham, but both kept public-houses in Dorking, and both played great\r\ncricket for the county. Many stories are told of Jupp, who was a\r\nfavourite with the crowd, but one of the oldest belongs to Cotmandene.\r\nThe match was for his benefit, and he was batting. Playing back at a\r\nball, he trod on his wicket, and a bail fell. He picked up the bail,\r\nreplaced it, and was reminded that he was out. \"Out! At Dorking! Not\r\nme!\" Nor did he go out, but made a hundred instead.\r\n\r\nAnother of Dorking's inhabitants made history in a different way.\r\nBrayley's _History of Surrey_ was printed throughout in Dorking, and\r\nEde, the printer, is said to have spent over L10,000 in the printing.\r\nWhat he made out of it is doubtful; he had made the L10,000 by his three\r\nbusinesses as printer, chemist, and perfumer.\r\n\r\nThe real Dorking, apart from its battles over and to come, is\r\nsufficiently happy to have had very little history. The Danes sacked it,\r\ntradition says: they cannot have had much plunder. Julius Caesar marched\r\nthrough it, perhaps, if there was a Dorking then; the Roman road, at all\r\nevents, the great Stone Street, which is still an English road by Ockley\r\nto the south, drove through the corner of Dorking churchyard. Another\r\nevent of the dark days was an earthquake in 1551, in which, according to\r\nHenry Machyn's _Diary_, \"pottes, panes, and dysys dounst and mett fell\r\ndowne abowt howse and with many odur thyngs.\" But an earthquake which\r\ncould do nothing more than make pots, pans and dishes dance is hardly an\r\nearthquake at all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps its greatest event of historical times was a funeral. On the\r\n23rd of December, 1815, Charles Howard, eleventh Duke of Norfolk, was\r\nburied at Dorking with the pomp and pageantry of a king. The procession\r\nleft St. James's Square in London at nine in the morning; the coach and\r\nsix horses of the Duke of Sussex and twenty carriages followed it; they\r\nreached Dorking at five. Deputy Garter King of Arms, Norroy King of\r\nArms, three heralds and three pursuivants attended in tabards of state;\r\nDeputy Garter, after the service, proclaimed the Duke's styles and\r\ntitles:--\r\n\r\n      The Most High, Mighty, and Most Potent Prince,\r\n          Charles Howard, Duke of Norfolk,\r\n                   Earl Marshal,\r\n        And Hereditary Earl Marshal of England,\r\n                Earl of Arundel Castle,\r\n      Earl of Surrey, Earl of Norfolk, Earl of Norwich,\r\n                   Baron Mowbray,\r\n          Baron of Howard, Baron of Segrave,\r\n                Baron Brurese of Gower,\r\n        Baron Fitzalan, Baron Warren, Baron Clun,\r\n           Baron Oswaldestre, Baron Maltravers,\r\n      Baron Greystock, Baron Furnival, Baron Verdon,\r\n                Baron Lovetot, Baron Strange,\r\n        And Premier Baron Howard of Castle Rising,\r\n    Premier Duke, Premier Earl, Premier Baron of England,\r\n      And Chief of the Illustrious Family of the Howards.\r\n\r\nThe parish registers add little that can have stirred the world. Eleven\r\nyears after the earthquake, on February 28, 1562, \"Owyn Tonny was\r\nchristened; who (a later hand adds), scoffing at thunder, standing under\r\na beech was stroke to death, his clothes stinking with a sulphurious\r\nstench, being about the age of twenty years or thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\nAnother entry is more personal. De Foe, perhaps, who lived near Dorking,\r\nand knew two Dorking giants, might have liked to see the parish register\r\nside by side with a note in his \"Tour.\" The \"Tour\" gives two\r\nmeasurements of the giants:--\r\n\r\n\"At this place lived another ancient gentleman and his son, of a very\r\ngood family, Augustine Bellson, Esq.; the father measured seven feet and\r\na half, and allowing that he might have sunk for his age, being\r\nseventy-one years old; and the son measured two inches taller than his\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Parish Register, 1738, May 16: \"Richard Madderson, aged 29\r\nyears, and was not above three feet and three inches high; but in\r\nthickness grown as much as any other person. He was all his life\r\ntroubled with an inward griping distemper, of which he at last died very\r\nsuddenly.\"\r\n\r\nThus the quiet life of Dorking in the quiet centuries. The days before\r\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, with the introduction of machinery for hand\r\nlabour, saw the usual terror and the usual threats. \"Captain Rock\" and\r\n\"Captain Swing\" signed the letters which were sent to Dorking farmers;\r\nspecial constables were sworn, the windows of the Red Lion were broken,\r\nand once, on November 22, 1830, a van drawn by four horses took Dorking\r\nprisoners to the county gaol. Cavalry patrolled the town by night; but\r\nthat November saw the end of Dorking's nearest knowledge of modern war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nWOTTON AND LEITH HILL\r\n\r\n    Denbies.--Tea veniente die.--A Temple of gloom.--Wotton House.--John\r\n    Evelyn.--A child of five.--The Crossways.--Dabchicks in the\r\n    Tillingbourne.--Friday Street.--A Swiss tarn.--Leith Hill.--The Day\r\n    of Days.--Forty-one spires unseen.--Anstiebury Camp.--The Black\r\n    Adder of Leith Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth-west of Dorking, and overlooking the wide greenness of the Weald\r\naway to Leith and Holmbury Hills, is Denbies, now the residence of the\r\nLord Lieutenant of the County, and once the property of Mr. Jonathan\r\nTyers. Jonathan Tyers was the Kiralfy of a less aspiring age. He was the\r\nfounder of Vauxhall Gardens, where, as Boswell puts it, you had a form\r\nof entertainment \"peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation;\r\nthere being a mixture of curious show--gay exhibition--music, vocal and\r\ninstrumental, not too refined for the general ear, for all which only a\r\nshilling is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking\r\nfor those who choose to purchase that regale.\" The founder of Vauxhall\r\nGardens was also the father of Tom Tyers, the wit who parodied Virgil\r\nover Dr. Johnson's tea-cups--\r\n\r\n    \"Tea veniente die, tea decedente\"\r\n\r\n--a phrase which has been of incalculable service to tea-drinking\r\nundergraduates. It was Tom Tyers who summed up Dr. Johnson, to the\r\nDoctor's liking: \"Tom Tyers described me the best: 'Sir,' said he, 'you\r\nare like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.'\"\r\n\r\nJonathan Tyers reserved a private gloom for his own garden at Denbies.\r\nHe named one of his plantations _Il Penseroso_ and in it built a small\r\ntemple which he bespattered with dismal texts. A clock struck every\r\nminute, to remind the visitor of the constant approach of death, and in\r\nan alcove were two life-size paintings of a Christian and an Unbeliever\r\nin their last moments. At the end of a walk stood a pair of pedestals,\r\none of which carried a \"Gentleman's Scull\" and the other a \"Lady's\r\nScull\" with appropriate verses; upon all of which melancholy properties\r\nMr. John Timbs in his _Picturesque Promenade Round Dorking_, printed in\r\n1823, meditates thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Such eccentric imageries, making irrefragable appeals to the\r\n    feelings of the dissolute debauchee, might form a persuasive\r\n    penitentiary, and urge the necessity of amendment with better effect\r\n    than all the farcical frenzies of mere formalists and fanatics.\"\r\n\r\nA later owner removed temple and all. Denbies of to-day offers the\r\ntraveller a kindlier welcome by allowing access to more than one private\r\nroadway, from which the outlook over the country to the south is more\r\nthan worth the steady climb from Dorking.\r\n\r\nThe road runs on to Ranmer Common, where Mr. John Timbs was able to look\r\nnorth to the dome and pinnacles of St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster\r\nAbbey, but I was not lucky enough with the weather. Ranmer has a church\r\nmore finely placed, I think, than any in the county, except perhaps St.\r\nMartha's; but St. Martha's has no spire like Ranmer. Ranmer spire is a\r\nlandmark: you take your bearings from that graceful needle for many\r\nmiles in central Surrey, as you may from Crooksbury Hill in the west.\r\nEast Surrey has no landmark quite so friendly.\r\n\r\nPolesden Lacey, where Sheridan lived after his second marriage, is a\r\nmile away to the north. To the south, below Ranmer, at the foot of the\r\nDowns, is Westcott, once a small hamlet and now something more, with a\r\npretty little church set on a hill. Further on the road west, is Wotton\r\nHatch, and at Wotton House and in the church you are with John Evelyn.\r\nOf all the great men who belong to Surrey history, John Evelyn is first.\r\nHe had not the religious exaltation, nor the ambition of a stern divine\r\nlike Archbishop Abbot; he had the dignity, but not the desire of public\r\nservice, of a politician such as Sir Arthur Onslow; he was not a fiery\r\nreformer like William Cobbett, or a diplomatist like Sir William\r\nTemple; he left behind him no such monument of stately learning as\r\nEdward Gibbon, nor a record of military service like that of the great\r\nHoward, the general of Queen Elizabeth's navy at sea against the navy of\r\nSpain. But what he left will endure; the fame of an English gentleman\r\nwho was honest, surrounded by intrigue; unambitious of honours and\r\ntitles, a royalist who had the friendship of kings whom courtiers\r\nflattered; a virtuoso of learning hardly equalled in his time, a diarist\r\nwhose jottings, never meant for printing, are a classic; a pious,\r\nhonourable, shrewd, country squire of deep family affections, and set in\r\na niche of his own by all who live and work in the country to-day, as\r\none of the greatest of English woodmen and gardeners. Upon his grave, on\r\nthe two hundredth anniversary of his death, February 27, 1906, the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries placed a wreath of bays--an honour, I think,\r\nunique in the annals of Surrey churches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wotton House._]\r\n\r\nThe Evelyns have their own chapel in Wotton Church, locked by the same\r\nwooden gate which opened to John Aubrey. In the little square space lie\r\nJohn Evelyn and his wife, in raised tombs, and on the walls are\r\nelaborate memorials of other Evelyns. One tomb the chapel does not hold,\r\nthough John Evelyn intended it should. His son Richard, who lived to be\r\nscarcely five years old, died at Sayes Court, John Evelyn's property in\r\nKent, and lies at Deptford. The father wrote nothing sadder than his\r\nshort record of his child's few years--a strange enough comment on the\r\nlife of the nursery (if it was a nursery) of Stuart days:--\r\n\r\n\"At two years and a-half old, he could perfectly read any of the\r\nEnglish, Latin, French, or Gothic letters, pronouncing the three first\r\nlanguages exactly. He had, before the fifth year, or in that year, not\r\nonly skill to read most written hands, but to decline all the nouns,\r\nconjugate the verbs regular, and most of the irregular; learned out\r\n_Puerilis_, got by heart almost the entire vocabulary of French\r\nprimitives and words, could make congruous syntax, turn English into\r\nLatin, and _vice versa_, construe and prove what he read and did the\r\ngovernment, and use of relatives, verbs, substantives, ellipses, and\r\nmany figures and tropes, and made a considerable progress in Comenius's\r\n_Janua_; began himself to write legibly, and had a strong passion for\r\nGreek.... He was all life, all prettiness, far from morose, sullen, or\r\nchildish in anything he said or did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from childish\"--it is perverse enough. John Evelyn himself began\r\nthe dreary round of tropes and primitives almost as early. He was taught\r\nin a little room above Wotton church porch, by one Frier, when he was\r\nnearly four. The porch has been renewed, and the room has gone.\r\n\r\nWotton House stands in a dip of grassland under noble trees. It is\r\nlittle like what it was in Evelyn's day, for fire has taken away part of\r\nit, and much that is new is added. The result is partly imposing, partly\r\nincongruous; but much of the best of the house has aged well, and the\r\nred-brick court and walled carriage-drive stand finely from their\r\nbackground. Behind the house is the terraced garden which Evelyn himself\r\nmade, and beyond it a streak of water running between wooded banks away\r\nto the blue dimness of Leith Hill. John Evelyn shall describe Wotton as\r\nhe knew it:--\r\n\r\n    \"The house is large and ancient, suitable to those hospitable times,\r\n    and so sweetly environed with those delicious streams and venerable\r\n    woods, as in the judgment of strangers as well as Englishmen it may\r\n    be compared to one of the most pleasant seats in the nation, and\r\n    most tempting for a great person and a wanton purse to make it\r\n    conspicuous. I will say nothing of the air, because the pre-eminence\r\n    is universally given to Surrey, the soil being dry and sandy; but I\r\n    should speak much of the gardens, fountains, and groves that adorn\r\n    it, were they not generally known to be amongst the most natural,\r\n    and (till this later and universal luxury of the whole nation, since\r\n    abounding in expenses) the most magnificent that England afforded.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Wotton and Westcott is The Rookery, once the home of David\r\nMalthus, father of the historian and economist. The name of David\r\nMalthus hides behind his more famous son's; but he was a translator of\r\nthe _Sorrows of Werther_ and of _Paul and Virginia_, who deserves\r\nmemories of his own. He lies in Wotton churchyard.\r\n\r\nFrom Wotton one might go on by Abinger Hammer to Gomshall, but the\r\nnatural round, perhaps, and certainly one of the loveliest walks in the\r\ncounty, is by Abinger Hatch and Friday Street to Leith Hill. But by\r\nneither way must anyone walking by these roads miss the Crossways, a\r\nmile west of Wotton Hatch, with its perfect little farmhouse and the\r\nstream running through the fields past Abinger Mill. The Crossways\r\nfarmhouse--perhaps Mr. Meredith had the name in his mind when he\r\nimagined the most gracious of his heroines--is of all the Surrey\r\nfarmhouses I know the most fascinating. It lies behind a high wall,\r\nwhich runs round a square little garden; you peep through a gateway\r\ncovered with ivy, and find an old lichened, weatherworn house, with\r\nornamented brickwork and latticed windows, a house which Evelyn's\r\ngrandfather may have known, and would find to-day unaltered. Crossways\r\nfarm is most like Slyfields, the old Jacobean house near Bookham, but it\r\nis smaller, and is, I think, perfect, whereas Slyfields is a fragment.\r\nCrossways, besides its delightful front, has a fine chimney stack, and a\r\nstrange but most satisfying buttress which ties the house to the garden\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThe farm lies among pasture-lands through which rushes the prettiest\r\npossible little brook. It is the Tillingbourne, here a stripling, and\r\nnever much bigger for that matter; but here it is the meadow-brook in\r\nits ideal form. It runs from a broken mill-wheel below an old\r\nhammerpond, past a cottage shaded by four noble yews, and then races\r\nthrough two meadows faster, I think, than any brook anywhere else in\r\nSurrey. The water runs with the deep sparkle of cut glass;\r\nforget-me-nots grow about it, and reed mace, and figwort and\r\nbittersweet; waterhens wander in the shaven grass of its brim, and\r\ndabchicks go plump in the current like cricket-balls. There may be trout\r\nin the stream here as there are by Albury, but I am sure it runs too\r\nfast and round too many corners for anybody to catch them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Crossways Farmhouse, Abinger._]\r\n\r\nThe road leads south and up hill from the Crossways to Abinger Hatch,\r\nbordering deep woods of oak and beech. In July and August the glades of\r\nthe Abinger woods, like the woods about Byfleet and Woking, gleam with\r\nthe pinks and purples of rosebay. Abinger Hatch is no more a village\r\nthan Wotton Hatch: both are wayside inns, and Abinger Hatch one of the\r\nbest country inns to be found in a walk. Saturdays and Sundays in the\r\nsummer fill it with guests from almost everywhere, who sit down to a\r\nlong table; my own first visit to the inn was on an ordinary weekday,\r\nand the surprise was to discover that there was a hot lunch ready. Such\r\nsurprises are rare. But Abinger has everything worth keeping of the old\r\ncustoms. The stocks stand at the churchyard gate, mouldering, but they\r\nare there. The inn has the old name, and the little old bar, and the\r\nold-fashioned custom of hanging the squire's portrait in the\r\ndining-room. Only the church is a difficulty. It is kept locked, and it\r\ntakes ten minutes to walk to the rectory to get the key--too far for the\r\npatience of those who would merely wish for rest and refreshment in the\r\ncool and sacredness of a country church. I was fortunate in my day, for\r\nI found the vestry door accidentally open, and a kindly countrywoman\r\ncleaning the church; she let me in. The nave, with its hugely thick\r\nwalls and lancet windows, is unlike any other Surrey church; Mr. Philip\r\nJohnston, who perhaps knows more about Surrey churches than anyone else,\r\ndates it at 1080.\r\n\r\nNobody should go straight from Abinger Hatch to Leith Hill. You should\r\nturn aside to the left and let the road take you eastwards into the\r\nwoods. Then you may come upon the tiny gathering of cottages called\r\nFriday Street with a suddenness which is a delight. You turn a corner of\r\nthe road and you are in Switzerland. A little tarn, unruffled by any\r\nwind, mirroring a hill of pine-trees, lies below you; beyond the water\r\nis the blue reek of wood-fires; open grass runs to the edge of the lake,\r\na light green rim to the dark of the pines. So do the little emerald\r\ntarns lie like saucers full of sky and trees in pockets of the Alps. The\r\nillusion wants but the tinkle of cowbells: it would be pleasant to\r\npresent bells to straying goats.\r\n\r\nFrom Friday Street to the tower on Leith Hill is a walk through the very\r\ndepths of the wood. Heather glows in the openings of the pines, bracken\r\nbrushes rain on your sleeve, bilberries ripen in the scented heat, and\r\nalmost any path--though not the road--runs higher and higher to the open\r\nground at the very top. At the top, nine hundred and sixty-five feet up,\r\nyou are on the highest hill in the south-east of England.\r\n\r\nLeith Hill is not for the multitude which climbs Box Hill. It is further\r\nfrom London, and further from a railway station. But it calls its own\r\ncompanies of travellers, and they are often large; the roads from\r\nHolmwood, which is the nearest station, are lined with notices\r\nindicating the right direction. When brakes carry excursionists from\r\nHolmwood, the brakes halt at the foot, and the visitors climb. The\r\nclimb ends in a tower with a story. It was built by Richard Hull, eldest\r\nbencher of the Inner Temple and member of several Irish Parliaments. He\r\nbuilt it, his Latin inscription informs you, for the enjoyment of\r\nhimself and his neighbours, and six years later, in 1772, he was buried\r\nunder it. Gratefully enough, the neighbourhood rifled the dead man's\r\ntower of its doors and windows; then, by way of compensation, to prevent\r\nmore robbery, filled it half full of cement. It was left to the late\r\nowner of Wotton, Mr. W.J. Evelyn, in 1863 to restore the building and to\r\nadd a staircase, and I believe the platform of the roof stands now\r\nexactly a thousand feet above sea level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Friday Street._]\r\n\r\nThe full view from Leith Hill has been described by a number of very\r\nfortunate persons. Aubrey was one of the first, and he estimated that\r\nthe whole circumference of the horizon could not be less than two\r\nhundred miles. It is probably more. But did Aubrey ever see the full\r\nvision? If he did, he climbed the hill on a lucky day. English weather\r\nsends few days clear enough of mist to set a sharp outline on the\r\nKentish downs, the Buckinghamshire hills and the slopes of Wiltshire,\r\nand the combination of transparent air and presence in the neighbourhood\r\nof a great height must be rare for ordinary men. Yet Leith Hill, even on\r\nthe mistiest day, can give the true notion of height. The first day I\r\nclimbed it was after a night of July rain. A wind had sprung up and\r\nseemed from the lower roads about the hill to have blown the distance\r\nclear. Then came an hour of hot sunshine, and the sudden view of the\r\nweald was of a sea of cloud. For two or three miles, perhaps, near the\r\nhill the oaks and elms, the roofs and the roads were plain enough.\r\nBeyond swam an infinite veil. But the sense of height, of detachment,\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nI have never been on Leith Hill on the day of days, nor seen the spires\r\nof forty-one churches in London, which the Ordnance Surveyors counted in\r\n1844, nor watched a sail on the sea through Shoreham Gap. But I was once\r\nthere on an August day of sunshine and cold rain and wind, and saw all\r\nthe southern view in a way I should like to see it again. I came to the\r\nhill from the west by Coldharbour, and black rain brooded over all the\r\ndistance to the east. To the south-east the air was clear to the Kent\r\nhorizon; north-east the glass of the Crystal Palace winked in the sun.\r\nThen the rain came down over the weald to the south and the west, and\r\nthe cloud rode over the fields and dotted trees like the shower of rain\r\nin Struwelpeter, blotting out the villages and the Sussex downs one by\r\none. Then behind the cloud drove up blank blue air, and to the west\r\nHindhead and Blackdown and hills beyond them came clean cut in a cold\r\nwind that made my eyes water; Hascombe Hill stood up dark and far, and\r\nthe Hog's Back to the north of it, edged like grey paper; I was lucky to\r\nsee the Hog's Back so plainly, the vendor of tea and melons at the tower\r\ntold me; she had seen the sea by Shoreham Gap that morning, but often\r\nwent a week without seeing the Hog's Back. Below, to the south-west,\r\nVachery Pond lay a gold mirror; Chanctonbury Ring faithfully marked the\r\nsouth as the rain drew past, and I left Leith Hill with the rain cloud\r\nriding down wind like night over the weald of Kent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Among the Pines._]\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory result of climbing a hill for a view is that you must\r\ncome down again. Leith Hill is better than other hills for the reason\r\nthat if you come down the best way, which is eastwards, you can climb up\r\nalmost as high again on the other side of the dip and walk nearly a mile\r\nin the wind at the edge of a ridge overlooking half Kent and Sussex, and\r\nthen come to the prettiest village of all the Downs. Friday Street is\r\nless a village than a handful of cottages, but Coldharbour has its\r\nchurch and its inn, the Plough, and its scattered roofs lie on the side\r\nof a valley of green brake and red sand. Coldharbour is almost as Swiss\r\nas Friday Street, and the paint of its inn as bright white as any in the\r\nsun of the Engadine. If Friday Street lacks the cowbells, Coldharbour\r\nwould be complete with the grey turbulence of snow-water.\r\n\r\nLeft and right of Leith Hill are two great camps, both of them firmly\r\nlinked in local legend with Caesar and the Danes, and both of them\r\nconnected by history with neither. Like the camp on St. George's Hill,\r\nthe camps on Anstiebury and Holmbury Hills were ancient British\r\nsettlements; places of refuge where the men of the tribe left their\r\nwomen and children and cattle while they themselves went out with their\r\nstone-tipped arrows to find the men of other tribes. Anstiebury Camp is\r\nthe larger, and covers eleven acres or so of what is now deep beechwood.\r\n\r\nAnstiebury has an easy and certain derivation. Hean Stige Byrig is early\r\nEnglish for the Bury of the High-way. Mr. H.E. Malden, in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_, points out that this may be the Roman Stone\r\nStreet, which passes half a mile left of the hill, or it may be the\r\nancient British road which runs from Coldharbour to Dorking; the latter\r\nhe thinks most likely. Certainly a native with proper pride would hardly\r\nrefer to the newly engineered road in the distance in preference to the\r\nwonderful highway close at hand. It runs from the hilltop north and\r\nsouth, cut deep in the yellow sandstone as the ancient Briton liked his\r\npathways cut. A man twenty feet high could walk invisible between the\r\nbanks of that sheltering trackway.\r\n\r\nAnstiebury camp came near to harbouring a modern garrison early in the\r\nlast century, when the Napoleon scare was at its wildest heights, and\r\ngood citizens went to bed praying that the next day \"Boney\" might not be\r\nthundering at the town gates; it was actually proposed that the old\r\nBritish Camp should be used to shelter the women and children of\r\nDorking. Another battle, an extra rumour or two, might have filled the\r\nbreaches with the dauntless subjects of King George. Happily, that cloud\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nRound the camps and the battlefields of the heights of Leith Hill and\r\nHolmbury cluster the names of wilder enemies than man. Bearhurst, Boars'\r\nHill and Wolf's Hill belong to the neighbourhood, and members of the\r\nSurrey Archaeological Society have heard Mr. Malden discourse incisively\r\non the scavengers' work after the battle of Ockley, when the West Saxons\r\nburied their dead, and there were no Danes left alive to bury theirs.\r\n\r\nLeith Hill has another curious record of an animal. On July 27, 1876, a\r\ntourist walking over the hill trod upon a snake, which bit him; he\r\nmanaged to get to Ockley, but died in two days. The interest of the\r\nrecord is that Mr. J.S. Bright, the historian of Dorking, says that the\r\nsnake was a black adder, _Coronella laevis_, while Mr. Boulenger, in his\r\nlist of Surrey snakes does not admit that the _Coronella laevis_ has\r\never occurred in the county.\r\n\r\nFrom Anstiebury the old high road runs steep to Dorking--a road of later\r\nmemories of sudden death than British battles. On a gallows at the foot\r\nof the hill three highwaymen once hung in chains. A house has been built\r\nupon the very spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Looking towards Dorking from Westcott._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nDORKING TO REIGATE\r\n\r\n    Nicknames.--Anastasius Hope.--Deepdene.--Mr. Howard's\r\n    Garden.--Betchworth Chestnuts and Castle.--Brockham badgers.--The\r\n    Straw-yards.--Bakers among the roses.--Leigh: Lie.--Leigh\r\n    Place.--Ardernes and Copleys.--Sir Thomas's notion of a\r\n    Gentleman.--Buckland's barn.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf three dull nicknames, stuck like burrs on the mantles of Dorking's\r\nprophets, the dullest and prosiest has stuck to the richest.\r\n\"Conversation\" is a pretty severe burden for a man named plain Richard\r\nSharp to carry; the hideousness of the baulked elision of \"Sylva\" Evelyn\r\nsets the teeth on edge (he developed into \"Sylvie\" as well as \"Silver\"\r\nEvelyn, poor man); \"Capability\" Brown, the gardener, must have been\r\nbuttonholed by a thousand bores; but \"Anastasius\" Hope is beyond\r\ntolerance. How should such a name be endured? Thomas Hope endured it. He\r\nwas the owner of Deepdene, the great house and garden and park a mile\r\nwest of Dorking, property that once belonged to the Howards, and in\r\nparticular to the ninth Duke of Norfolk. His father was a vastly wealthy\r\nAmsterdam merchant, he himself a patron and a critic of art. He gave\r\nThorwaldsen his first commission in marble, and Thorwaldsen celebrated\r\nthe day of the order every year of his life. But he owed his name to a\r\nromance, _Anastasius or Memoirs of a Modern Greek_, which he wrote at\r\nhis leisure, and which places him, as Mr. John Timbs, promenading around\r\nDorking in 1824, assures us, \"in the highest list of eloquent writers\r\nand superior men.\" The _Edinburgh Reviewer_ was not less effusive. Until\r\n_Anastasius_ was published he had known Mr. Hope merely as the author of\r\nan essay on _Household Furniture and Interior Decoration_. In\r\n_Anastasius_ was the change from the upholsterer to the epicurean.\r\n\r\nDeepdene still holds statues and pictures, of which Mr. Bright, in his\r\nhistory of Dorking, gives a long list. Such a list belongs rightly to a\r\nhistory; but since the pictures can no longer be seen, other pages need\r\nbut note that permission is occasionally granted to walk in the park.\r\nAubrey's engaging description of the garden as he saw it late in the\r\nseventeenth century, a hundred years before Mr. Thomas Hope, belongs to\r\nhis century and ours:--\r\n\r\n    \"Near this place the Honourable Charles Howard of Norfolk hath very\r\n    ingeniously contrived a long Hope (_i.e._, according to Virgil,\r\n    _Deductus Vallis_) in the most pleasant and delightful solitude for\r\n    house, gardens, orchards, boscages etc., that I have seen in\r\n    England: It deserves a Poem and was a subject worthy of Mr. Cowley's\r\n    Muse. The true name of this Hope is Dibden (quasi Deep Dene).\r\n\r\n    Mr. Howard hath cast this Hope in the form of a theatre on the sides\r\n    whereof he hath made seven narrow walks like the seats of a theatre,\r\n    one above another, about six in number, done with a plough, which\r\n    are bordered with thyme, and some cherry-trees, myrtles, etc. Here\r\n    was a great many orange trees and syringas which were then in\r\n    flower. In this garden are twenty-one sorts of thyme. The pit, as I\r\n    may call it, is stored full of rare flowers and choice plants. He\r\n    hath there two pretty lads his gardeners, who wonderfully delight in\r\n    their occupation, and this lovely solitude, and do enjoy themselves\r\n    so innocently in that pleasant corner, as if they were out of this\r\n    troublesome world, and seem to live in the state of innocency.\"\r\n\r\nBut not the gardeners alone. The visitor had a quiet mind who could\r\nexclaim, as John Aubrey did, that \"the pleasures of the garden were so\r\nravishing that I can never expect any enjoyment beyond it but the\r\nKingdom of Heaven.\" Aubrey has been called ill-natured, and a\r\nscandal-lover. Nobody ever called him that who has met him in a garden.\r\n\r\nEast of Dorking and the Deepdene are half-a-dozen Betchworths.\r\nBetchworth Clump rides a shoulder of the downs, with a superb view to\r\nthe south; Betchworth village lies under the Clump a mile and more from\r\nthe foot of the hill; Betchworth Park and Castle are between the village\r\nand Deepdene. Through the park runs a road, and an avenue of wonderful\r\nlimes, but the Castle, which cannot be seen from the part of the park\r\nopen to the public, is a castle no longer. It was never more than a\r\ncastle in name; Sir Thomas Browne fortified it under Henry VI, but it\r\nsaw no fighting. Thomas Hope's father, when he added Betchworth to his\r\npurchase of the Deepdene, pulled it down, and a mere fragment remains.\r\nNot much younger than the ruins, perhaps, are the gnarled and twisted\r\nboles of the Betchworth sweet chestnuts. Albury Park holds some giants,\r\nand there are a few trees quite as fine in Weybridge gardens that once\r\nstood on royal ground, but the Betchworth chestnuts must be older than\r\neither.\r\n\r\nBadgers must have been common by Betchworth, for Brocks multiply in the\r\nlocal names. Brockham village, with a pretty green, stands beyond\r\nBetchworth Park on the Mole; probably the badger has left Brockham since\r\nthe bricklayer came out of Dorking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Red Lion, Betchworth._]\r\n\r\nOther outdoor life has survived; Brockham still plays good cricket.\r\nCricket was a favourite game on Brockham Green very early in its\r\nhistory. Cotmandene was not far away, and no doubt Cotmandene cricket\r\nencouraged smaller games. One of the customs of Brockham players was to\r\nwear straw hats of a pattern made in the village, and when the eleven\r\nwent to play over at Mitcham there were derisive shouts--\"Here come the\r\nBrockham straw yards.\" But the straw yards won, and in an innings.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite easy for a stranger to pass through the Betchworth\r\nthat lies on the main road between Dorking and Reigate, and to believe\r\nhe had seen it all. But the best of Betchworth is by the little church,\r\nsouth of the main road on a bend of the Mole. The church, cool and\r\nwhite, stands deep in a ring of beeches, elms, and ash-trees, and the\r\nbaker and grocer of the village lives among roses in a little street of\r\ncottage gardens opposite. At least one of the bequests to the parish is\r\ncuriously described on the church wall. Mrs. Margaret Fenwick left L200,\r\nwhich was to be used partly in binding out poor children as apprentices,\r\nand partly \"in prefering in marriage such Maid Servants born in this\r\nParish as shall respectfully live Seven Years in any Service and whose\r\nfriends are not able to do it.\" The intention is clear, but friends\r\nunable to live respectfully seven years in one service would, one would\r\nthink, be numerous.\r\n\r\nThe real centre from which to see the country east and south of\r\nBetchworth is Reigate, but a walk from Dorking to Reigate might very\r\nwell take in Leigh, which is a little out of the beaten track. But if\r\nyou ask the way, do not inquire for \"Lee.\" \"Lie\" is the name. The\r\nvillage is very small, but it stands round a pretty little green, and\r\none of the old timbered cottages with a Horsham slab roof sets the right\r\ngrace to a group with the church and its trees. Leigh church has fine\r\nbrasses of the Arderne family, who had Leigh Place, once an ancient and\r\nmoated house half a mile north of the village, now a rather nondescript\r\nbut quaint building; the moat remains, the house has been partly pulled\r\ndown, partly rebuilt. Leigh Place belonged first to the great family of\r\nde Braose, but its earliest legends are of the Ardernes. There was a Sir\r\nThomas de Arderne who wooed Margery, the wife of Nicholas de Poynings,\r\nin a very rough manner; he saw no way to making her his own wife except\r\nby making her widow of de Poynings, and so killed him. Tradition says\r\nthat she died of a broken heart, and haunts Leigh Place, a sad lady in\r\nwhite; but it was probably not Sir Thomas, but a descendant of his, who\r\nfirst had Leigh Place. Still, to Leigh belongs the story. After the\r\nArdernes, Leigh Place came to the Copleys, who were also of Gatton. One\r\nof them, Sir Thomas Copley, had original notions as to the proper\r\nbearing and attributes of an English gentleman. Mr. John Watney, writing\r\nin the _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, gives a long letter which Sir\r\nThomas wrote to Queen Elizabeth in 1575, defending himself, among other\r\nthings, for having taken to himself titles to which he had no right. His\r\ndefence is ingenious:--\r\n\r\n    \"As to the other point, where your Majesty showed to be informed,\r\n    that I had attributed to myself in those letters of marque greater\r\n    titles than became me or than I could well avow, that must needs be\r\n    either in that I termed myself _nobilis Anglus_, or in that, for\r\n    more credit both to myself and your service, I was bold to set down\r\n    _Dominus de Gatton_, _Roughey_ etc., naming certain my Lordships.\r\n    To the first I beseech your Majesty to consider, that there is no\r\n    other Latin word proper to signify a gentleman born, but _nobilis_.\r\n    As for _generosus_, as I have read in good writers _Vinum\r\n    generosum_, for a good cup of wine and _equus generosus_ for a\r\n    courageous horse, so I never heard _generosus_ alone so used, to\r\n    signify a gentleman born, but only on the gross Latin current in\r\n    Westminster Hall, and, if I had set down _generosus Anglus_, it\r\n    would have then construed rather a gentle Englishman than an English\r\n    gentleman. And as for _armiger_, it had yet been more barbarous, for\r\n    surely the world here abroad would rather have understood by that\r\n    strange term a page or a sword-bearer than a gentleman of the better\r\n    sort, as custom has made it to be construed in England; that this is\r\n    simply true, I doubt not, but that your Majesty, excelling in your\r\n    knowledge of good letters, will easily judge a gracious sentence on\r\n    my suit.... So that in setting down the term _nobilis_ used through\r\n    the world for a gentleman, I had no intention to make myself more\r\n    noble than I am, but to take only that which was due unto me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buckland._]\r\n\r\nI have taken Leigh on the way to Reigate. But the best way to see Leigh\r\non a short walk is to reach it from Reigate travelling west. The\r\nintroduction is by way of Reigate Heath, a wide and breezy common on\r\nwhich an old black windmill stands high above heather and bracken, a\r\ngaunt and wild neighbour to the orderly villas of the town.\r\n\r\nLast of the little villages under the downs between Dorking and Reigate\r\nis Buckland--a handful of cottages, a pond, and a noble barn with\r\nupper-works like a tower. Buckland keeps tranquilly apart from Reigate,\r\nand Reigate, considerately enough, builds her new houses towards the\r\nrailway and Redhill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Roman Road at Ockley._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nUNDER LEITH HILL\r\n\r\n    The Battle of Ockley.--The Stone Street.--The prettiest green in\r\n    Surrey.--Sweethearts and Roses.--When the Gentlemen went by.--An\r\n    engaging family history.--Oakwood: a forest chapel.--Capel\r\n    quiet.--Newdigate bells.--Martins in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nBattlefields are not very numerous in Surrey. The Parliamentary wars\r\nshed a little military glory on the North and the West, and attacks on\r\nLondon from the Surrey side--its invulnerable side--belong to almost\r\nevery century of London's history. But the great Surrey battle, which\r\nbelongs to Ockley under Leith Hill, is of the battles of long ago, dim\r\nand hazy in the mist of centuries, fearful with legends of blood in\r\nrivers, and warriors laid in swathes like mown corn. Even now, country\r\ntradition asserts, the rain that sweeps down Leith Hill sends the\r\nrainpools red in the plain below. The great battle of Ockley was fought\r\nwhen the Danes came two hundred and fifteen years before Harold fell at\r\nHastings. They had sailed across to Kent, the historian says, with three\r\nhundred and fifty large ships, and had driven in Ethelstan, who was king\r\nof Kent, Sussex, Essex, and Surrey, under his father Ethelwulf. They\r\nsacked Canterbury, and went up the Thames to London; there they beat in\r\nBeorhtwulf, king of the Mercians, and before them lay but one great\r\ntown, Winchester, unsacked. Down they swept over the Thames, and out of\r\nhis own country, Ethelwulf, of Wessex, overlord of the beaten Ethelstan\r\nand Beorhtwulf, came to meet them. Up the great Stone Street, the Roman\r\nroad that runs as straight as a die from Chichester, he marched, and lay\r\nacross the front of his enemy, clear of the deep forest that spread\r\nsouth of Ockley. The Danes came on. Perhaps they rested a night in the\r\nold British camp on Anstiebury Hill, perhaps they swept straight on:\r\nbattle was joined \"hard by Ockley wood.\" Local tradition, always apt to\r\nassociate notable deeds with easily marked places, makes the scene of\r\nthe battle Ockley Green; but the armies could not have seen each other\r\non the low ground, which must have been half swamp, half undergrowth.\r\nThey fought, no doubt, on the higher ground near Leith Hill. The\r\nslaughter was prodigious; \"blood stood ankle deep,\" and the day ended\r\nwith the great body of the Danes dead on the hills, and the rest flying\r\nwhere they could along the roads and through the woods. Probably not a\r\nDane got away alive. It was a wonderful victory.\r\n\r\nTo-day the peace that broods over Ockley is born of wooded parks and\r\nsunlit spaces. Ockley Green must be one of the largest in Surrey, and I\r\nthink is the prettiest of all. Along its western side runs a row of\r\nnoble elms, bordering the road, and under the shade of the elms an old\r\ninn. This road is actually part of the Stone Street up which Ethelwulf\r\nmarched against the Danes; and it would be hardly possible to devise a\r\nprettier road, as it passes under the Ockley elm trees, or a more\r\ntranquil outlook for an inn. Low-roofed cottages edge the grass, warm\r\nand sheltered; a drinking fountain on the green level suggests summer\r\ngames and thirsty cricketers; though I think Ockley has contributed no\r\ngreat cricketers to the game. Beyond the green lie stretches of pasture\r\nand rich and smiling woodland.\r\n\r\nThe church stands nearly a mile from the green, and to its quiet acre\r\nbelongs one of the prettiest traditions of bygone Surrey--the planting\r\nof rose-trees over the graves of betrothed lovers. It was still a custom\r\nin Aubrey's time:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the churchyard are many red rose-trees planted among the graves,\r\n    which have been there beyond man's memory. The sweetheart (male or\r\n    female) plants roses at the head of the grave of the lover deceased;\r\n    a maid that had lost her dear twenty years since, yearly hath the\r\n    grave new turfed, and continues yet unmarried.\"\r\n\r\nRose-trees still grow in the churchyard, though perhaps the planting of\r\nthem does not go back beyond man's memory.\r\n\r\nAlthough so quiet a little village to-day, the neighbourhood of Ockley\r\nhas seen some wild doings. Holmbury Hill, to the north, was once one of\r\nthe principal settlements of the \"Heathers,\" or broom squires, who still\r\nsurvive, a more respectable and a weaker folk, under Hindhead and\r\nelsewhere. Here one of their chief occupations was smuggling; indeed,\r\nthe range of hills round Ewhurst and Holmbury Common served as a kind of\r\nhalfway house for the gentlemen who were riding with silk and brandy\r\nfrom the Sussex seaboard to London. It was a Burwash mother who used to\r\nput her child to bed with the injunction, \"Now, mind, if the gentlemen\r\ncome along, don't you look out of the window\"; doubtless the text which\r\ninspired Mr. Kipling's delightful verses. But there must have been many\r\na Ewhurst and Ockley mother who knew \"the gentlemen\" by sight, and\r\ncounselled confiding children to hold their tongues and look in the\r\nproper direction as the Burwash woman bids her child in Mr. Kipling's\r\nsong:--\r\n\r\n    \"If you meet King George's men, dressed in blue and red,\r\n    You be careful what you say, and mindful what is said.\r\n    If they call you 'pretty maid,' and chuck you 'neath the chin,\r\n    Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been\r\n    If you do as you've been told, likely there's a chance,\r\n    You'll be give a dainty doll, all the way from France,\r\n    With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood--\r\n    A present from the Gentlemen, along o' being good!\r\n          Five and twenty ponies\r\n          Trotting through the dark--\r\n          Brandy for the Parson,\r\n          'Baccy for the Clerk.\r\n    Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie--\r\n    Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!\"\r\n\r\nThe memory of smuggling under Leith Hill has, indeed, lasted into the\r\nlast decade. Mr. H.E. Malden, the Surrey historian to whom all Surrey\r\nwriters and readers owe so much, tells us in a paper on Holmbury Hill\r\nand its neighbourhood that he personally knew an old man, a native of\r\nColdharbour, who had actually seen the game going on. He was born, it is\r\ntrue, in 1802, but he lived to be a hundred years old, and to talk to\r\nMr. Malden discreetly about what he had seen. In his conversation Mr.\r\nMalden remarks with proper tranquillity \"he indicated this and that\r\nrespectable neighbour. Well, he said, his grandfather, and _his_\r\ngrandfather and so on, knew something about the smuggling. He, of\r\ncourse, had done nothing in that way, but he remembered his father\r\nholding open the gate at the end of Crocker's Lane, Coldharbour, for a\r\nbody of men on horseback, each with a keg of brandy behind him, to ride\r\nthrough. A man with whom he had worked told him how he was witness of a\r\nscene when a bold gatekeeper refused to open his turnpike gate to a body\r\nof armed men on horseback, who, after threatening him in vain, turned\r\naside across the fields.\" Relics of the past still remain in the\r\ndistrict. Under Holmbury Hill there is a cottage of which the cellars\r\nrun right back into the hill; tradition has placed kegs of brandy in\r\nthem. A naval cutlass was picked up some thirty years ago in a field by\r\nLeith Hill--possibly it was used in a smugglers' fray with King George's\r\nmen. Nor was it long ago that a trackway which runs from Forest Green,\r\ntwo miles to the west of Ockley, through Tanhurst over Leith Hill, was\r\nknown as the Smuggler's Way.\r\n\r\nSurrey yeomen come nowhere of better stock than the oldest Ockley\r\nfamilies. Aubrey tells a story of one of the Eversheds of Ockley, who,\r\nwhen the heralds made their visitation, was urged to take a coat of\r\narms. \"He told them that he knew no difference between gentlemen and\r\nyeomen, but that the latter were the better men, and that they were\r\nreally gentlemen only, who had longer preserved their estates and\r\npatrimonies in the same place, without waste or dissipation; an\r\nobservation very just.\" Aubrey adds, as examples of yeomen families who\r\nhad land at the Conquest, the names of Steere, Harpe, Hether, and Aston.\r\nSteere, like Evershed, is a name that occurs over and over again in the\r\nRegisters, both at Ockley and Capel.\r\n\r\nOckley's Parish Account Books, from which Mr. Alfred Bax--one of the\r\noldest of Ockley names--has made some most interesting transcripts in\r\nthe _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, furnish some quaint glimpses\r\ninto the life and customs of a Surrey village in old days. I make the\r\nfollowing extracts, of which the first is noticeable particularly as\r\nevidence that a post office existed at Ockley at least as early as\r\n1722:--\r\n\r\n    Dec y^e 29 day 1722.

The entries of 1739 and 1740\r\nare a perfect climax of hopes and fears, ending, it is impossible to\r\ndoubt, in the enjoyment by Sarah Rapley of every conceivable happiness.\r\nBut the joys hidden under the cold print of the last Rapley entry are\r\nonly dimly to be imagined. Henry Rapley's return from the sea, cured of\r\nhis dog-bite, must have brought out the whole village.\r\n\r\nTwo miles south-west of Ockley, a short way off the Stone street, stands\r\nthe lonely little chapel of Oakwood. It is one of the old forest\r\nchapels, and dates back to the thirteenth century, but was enlarged in\r\nthe fifteenth, the happy result of an accident. Sir Edward de la Hale\r\nwas hunting wild boar with his son in the forest hard by. They had\r\nwounded a boar, the boy was thrown from his horse, and the boar charged\r\ndown. His father spurred forward, too late to save him, when suddenly an\r\narrow whizzed through the trees and the boar fell dead. In his joy, the\r\nfather vowed on the spot an offering to the service of God, and Oakwood\r\nchapel was restored and endowed. The little building lies apart,\r\nsequestered in cornfields and deep woods, the quietest treasure of\r\nsudden discovery for the stranger walking idly by country lanes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the railway to the east of Ockley, approached by quiet oak-shaded\r\nroads, lies the little village of Capel, not much more than a half-mile\r\nof main street lined with cottages. Capel instils a pleasant\r\nrestfulness. Almost its chief buildings are the admirably designed\r\nalmshouses built in memory of Mr. Charles Webb of Clapham Common. In an\r\nage when \"improvements\" generally mean the destruction of something old,\r\nand \"additions\" to village housing accommodation mean yellow brick boxes\r\nand slate lids, it is a pleasure to set eyes upon a modern building\r\ninstinct with the spirit of country places. Capel people have long had\r\nproper views as to the right rate of progress through the business of\r\nlife. They are skilled, or some of them, in topiary, and when the garden\r\nof a tiny, red-tiled cottage contains a shaven yew tree recognisable as\r\na fair-sized bird, the tenour of village life must be agreeably even.\r\n\r\nThird of the three villages which group themselves south and south-west\r\nof Leith Hill is Newdigate, separated from Capel by over two miles of a\r\nzig-zagging road, though the distance for a steeplechase cannot be much\r\nmore than a mile from church to church. Newdigate church is the chief\r\npart of the little village. The tower is wholly built of oak, and the\r\nbeams supporting the belfry are almost as fine as those of the Thursley\r\ntower; possibly they are the work of the same craftsmen. Like other\r\nWealden churches, Newdigate has an abiding charm in her peal of bells.\r\nThey have been re-cast, but the Newdigate bellringers have long records\r\nof changes rung in the little tower. Some of the records are painted on\r\nwooden panels in the belfry. To the layman who has never rung a bell the\r\nnames of the changes are stimulating. Colledge Singles, Grandsire\r\nDoubles, College Exercise, and College Pleasure are fairly simple; but\r\nWithout a Dodge provokes thought, and Woodbine Violet must have been\r\nnamed by the village poet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Newdigate Church._]\r\n\r\nSurrey autumns invest the shingled spires of these Wealden churches\r\nwith a peculiar beauty. Grey and white, black-streaked and shining,\r\nweatherbeaten and weather-conquering, there is nothing in architecture\r\nlighter or more graceful than the patterned sheaths of native oak\r\nsurmounting belfries which, sometimes for centuries, have called the\r\nvillagers to church. But in late autumn, when the swallows and martins\r\nare practising starts for their long journey, the shingled spires turn\r\nthemselves to fresh uses. On a sunny day the birds come about them in\r\nscores, pressing their bodies flat against the warm, dry wood, darting\r\nout for short flights, hawking gnats and midges, and flitting back\r\nagain, keeping up through it all the sweetest and gentlest of anxious\r\ntwitterings, and, when they are clinging to the chequered wood,\r\nresembling it so closely in colour and texture as to make it hard to\r\ncount a dozen birds quickly. Martins near their time for going enter on\r\nall kinds of engaging habits, especially just before and just after\r\ndusk, when bands of a dozen or so seem suddenly to make up their minds\r\nto trial flights of the most amazing speed, utterly unlike their\r\nordinary, quiet flittings. But there is nothing prettier in all the\r\npageant of the migrants' year, than a dozen score martins with the\r\nunrest of autumn on them darting round a shingled spire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nREIGATE\r\n\r\n    Reigate Castle.--De Warenne.--A Swashbuckler and a Swordsman.--The\r\n    Reigate Caves.--Lord Holland's soldiering.--Pilgrims at the Red\r\n    Cross.--General of the Royale Navey.--Olde Dutchesse Norf.--\"W.\r\n    W.\"--Reigate Politics.--The Marble Hall.--The White Hart.--A Race\r\n    against Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour castles stood along the ridge of the Surrey downs when the barons\r\nwere at war, and of the four nothing worth the name of a castle remains.\r\nFarnham's keep was broken down by Cromwell: Guildford is a shell,\r\nReigate and Bletchingley have disappeared altogether. Betchworth, never\r\nfortified for war, was built later than the others, but Betchworth is an\r\ninsignificant ruin. The kings and the captains have passed, and their\r\nbuildings have followed them. The castles have gone down with the\r\npalaces. Surrey never had a castle like Arundel; but she has not been\r\nable to keep even a Pevensey or a Bodiam.\r\n\r\nYet Reigate castle and its owners shaped a great deal of English\r\nhistory. It belonged to the great Earls de Warenne, the rival family to\r\nthe de Clares through all the early wars and intrigues of the kings and\r\nthe barons. It stood on the ancient British track, the \"Way\" which runs\r\neast and west across the country. Its place on the Way was within reach\r\nof the Roman road, the Stone Street that ran from Chichester to London.\r\nIts possessor held the strongest strategic position between London and\r\nthe coastline, or between Canterbury and Winchester, and when there was\r\nany fighting forward the lord of the highway cross roads, the ridge\r\ngate, was the first person to be taken into account. The curious thing\r\nis that there was so little fighting along the ridge. Reigate Castle\r\nnever saw a pitched battle. When Louis of France was riding by the ridge\r\nto Winchester after King John, Reigate surrendered to the French, and de\r\nWarenne only got his castle back by changing sides from John to Louis.\r\nThat was in 1216, and forty-seven years later, when Simon de Montfort\r\ntook the baron's army by the ridge to Rochester, Reigate could do no\r\nmore than watch the army march by. The de Warenne of the day was at\r\nLewes with the king, and when the king had lost all in the battle of\r\nLewes that followed, the lord of Reigate castle fled to France. He came\r\nback the next year, and when de Montfort fell at Evesham, Reigate was\r\nonce more de Warenne's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reigate._]\r\n\r\nThe kings must have found this particular de Warenne a little difficult\r\nto deal with. He was a bit of a swashbuckler as well as a swordsman, and\r\nonce when he found himself getting the worst of a lawsuit at\r\nWestminster with one Alan de la Zouche, he ran him through the body in\r\nthe king's own chamber and was off to Reigate before anybody could stop\r\nhim. King Henry was furious, and sent Prince Edward, the great de Clare,\r\nand an archbishop to bid him come out of his castle and be punished. He\r\ncame out at last, and was fined ten thousand marks for the king and two\r\nthousand for Alan de la Zouche. But Prince Edward was not done with him.\r\nAs Edward the First he held a Court of Assize to inquire into the\r\nwarrants by which the barons held their lands. De Warenne was asked for\r\nhis warrant for Reigate. He drew a rusty sword and struck it on the\r\ncouncil table. \"By this instrument,\" he said, \"do I hold my lands, and\r\nby the same I intend to keep them.\" He kept them, but he had to amend\r\nhis plea into something a little less swaggering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Reigate Byway._]\r\n\r\nOf Reigate Castle not a stone remains. But under the great mound which\r\nbore the keep you may see what local tradition has named the Baron's\r\ncaves, where, as the story goes, the Barons met before the signing of\r\nMagna Charta. Martin Tupper, indeed, has written a whole chapter in\r\n_Stephan Langton_ describing the interesting scene, though as a mere\r\nmatter of history it never took place. To begin with, the de Warenne of\r\nthe day was an adherent of King John, and not of the barons, and in the\r\nnext place the barons marching to Runemede never came near Reigate at\r\nall. Mr. Tupper errs. But the passages and chambers hollowed out of the\r\nyellow sandstone are interesting, and so are the rough carvings of heads\r\nof horses which ornament the walls. Mr. Malden, the Surrey historian,\r\nthinks the caves are merely sand-quarries, sand being valuable for\r\nmaking mortar. It is pleasanter, though probably wholly incorrect, to\r\nimagine them as dungeons, or homes of early man, or even cellars. The\r\ngardener exhibits them with a candle, and in the dark they can be eerie\r\nenough for cave-bears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Park Lane, near Reigate._]\r\n\r\nLong after the de Warennes' reign was over, Reigate Castle saw more\r\nfighting. We met the leaders on both sides at Kingston. It was nearly at\r\nthe end of the Parliamentary wars, and Lord Holland, commanding the\r\nRoyalist troops, conceived the idea of a rising near London. There was\r\nto be a horse-race on Banstead Downs, to draw the people together, and\r\nhe was to lead them. Unhappily for his followers, he was a thoroughly\r\nincompetent soldier. He hoisted his standard at Kingston, and marched\r\nthrough Dorking to Reigate, where he held the castle and posted his\r\nvedettes on Red Hill. Sir Michael Livesey, commanding some Kentish horse\r\nfor the Parliament, was ordered up from Sevenoaks to meet him; Major\r\nAudley, one of Livesey's officers, was moved out from Hounslow, where he\r\nhad three troops, to clear Banstead Downs. Audley reached Reigate first,\r\nand engaged Lord Holland, but found him too strong: he drew off, and\r\nHolland, for no soldier's reason, fell back on Dorking. He came on again\r\nto Reigate next day, but by that time Livesey and Audley had joined, and\r\nwhen Holland knew who was before him he turned again for Kingston. As we\r\nsaw, his horse faced the Parliament's troops on Kingston Common, and he\r\ndied without glory on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nNot much remains even of the Reigate which Lord Holland's troops saw on\r\nthat luckless July day in 1648. The Parliament tumbled the old castle in\r\nruins, and as at Bletchingley, anybody who wanted to build a house or a\r\nbarn helped himself from the stones. To-day the steadiest modern\r\nbusiness fills the High Street and Bell Street, the two roads running\r\nwest and south along which old Reigate lay. Here and there the quaint\r\nslope of a red roof, or the lichen on weather-worn tiles, has a hold on\r\nthe past, and in Slip Shoe Street, itself echoing the days of\r\npilgrimages, care and good paint have preserved the beams of delightful\r\nold cottages. The Swan Inn, which may have liquored Holland's\r\ncavaliers, has borne much from later builders, but it stands on the old\r\nsite. Nearly all the rest of old Reigate has gone. The Red Cross Inn,\r\nwhere thirsty pilgrims dropping down from the chalk highway drank ale\r\nand rested, has made way for brand-new brick and rough-cast, painted a\r\nbright pink. The market which the pilgrims used to find at the western\r\nend of the town was moved to the centre cross-roads at the Reformation,\r\nand the little chapel at the cross-roads, where the pilgrims said their\r\nAves, came down in George the First's day to make room for what is now\r\ncalled the old Town Hall. It is only two hundred years old, but even it\r\nis not as its Georgian builder left it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reigate Heath._]\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Reigate Church in the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury will never be quite known. There were alterations in 1818, and\r\nit was restored in 1845; that is to say, much of its beautiful old work\r\nwas destroyed. But it has kept a few of its Norman pillars, and a\r\nreverent rebuilding of much of the fabric by Sir Gilbert Scott in 1873\r\nhas left its noble relics enshrined under a fine tower. The vault holds\r\nthe dust of two of England's greatest men. The first and second Lords\r\nHoward of Effingham lie there, each in his day Lord High Admiral of the\r\nEnglish navy. Charles, the second Lord Howard, died at Haling House near\r\nCroydon, and was buried at dead of night in the family vault on December\r\n23, 1624. Incredible as it sounds, from that day until 1888, the\r\nthree-hundredth anniversary of the defeat of the Armada, not a single\r\nrecord of the Admiral who met and destroyed it was to be seen in Reigate\r\nChurch, except the inscription on the coffin in the Howards' vault.\r\nThen, at last, the inscription was copied and placed on a brass in the\r\nchancel. Its terseness fits the dead man's name:--\r\n\r\n        Here in the vault beneath\r\n      at midnight the Dec. 23: 1624\r\n    lyeth the body of Charles Howarde\r\n            Earl of Nottingham\r\n                Admyrall of\r\n                  Englande\r\n      Generall of Queen Elizabeth's\r\n          Royale Navey at sea\r\n              Against the\r\n          Spanyards Invinsable\r\n                Navye\r\n        In the Year of our Lord\r\n        1589, who departed this\r\n      Life at Haling House the 14\r\n        Day of December in the\r\n        Year of our Lorde, 1624\r\n            Aetatis Suae 87\r\n\r\nWe saw the Howards at Effingham and Great Bookham, and shall find them\r\nagain at Lingfield. Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower, in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_, has brought together some interesting\r\nparticulars of the antiquities of the family. The second Duke of\r\nNorfolk, who was father of the first Lord Howard of Effingham, and now\r\nlies at Lambeth, left a remarkable will. He was, as his epitaph informs\r\nus, a \"High and Mighty Prince,\" and he writes of himself in the royal\r\nplural. He orders a tomb to be erected before the high altar of Thetford\r\n\"with pictures of us and Agnes our wife to be set together thereupon.\"\r\nThe Lambeth Parish Registers do not read so respectfully. This is the\r\nentry recording the passing of the Prince's widow--\"Oct. 13, 1545, my\r\nLady Agnes, olde Dutchesse Norf., buried.\"\r\n\r\nReigate churchyard holds the gravestones of two neighbours in name and\r\nplace. A Goose and a Gosling are buried side by side.\r\n\r\nWhen Reigate had a castle, it also had a priory. It was founded for\r\nAustin Canons by one of the de Warennes, and its first prior was an\r\nAdam. After the Dissolution, the Priory estate saw some strangely\r\ndifferent owners and guests. The first Lord Howard of Effingham, Lord\r\nHigh Admiral, had it; Foxe, perhaps meditating his _Book of Martyrs_,\r\nstayed there as tutor to the son of the Earl of Surrey; a century later\r\nthe manor came to Lord Somers, the great Lord Chancellor of William of\r\nOrange; to-day the modern house, built on the site of the old convent,\r\nbelongs to one of Lord Somers's descendants, Lady Henry Somerset. It\r\nholds a famous oak chimney-piece, said to have been brought from Henry\r\nVIII's vanished palace of Nonsuch.\r\n\r\nReigate Priory to-day means Reigate cricket, played on the Priory\r\nground. Three of the most famous of all Surrey cricketers belong to the\r\ntown. Stephen Dingate, first of Surrey players before Beldham, was born\r\nthere; so was William Caffyn, of the days of the giants Fuller Pilch and\r\nAlfred Mynn, Tom Lockyer and Julius Caesar; and so, too, was W.W. Read,\r\none of the very few Englishmen familiar to millions by their initials\r\nalone. \"W.G.\" and \"W.W.\" belong to the great years of the game.\r\n\r\nPolitics in Reigate are a mixed memory. Like Gatton, Reigate was a\r\npocket borough, and sent two members to Parliament until 1832, when the\r\ntwo were reduced to one. Even the one disappeared in 1867, when the\r\nborough was disfranchised for bribery and treating--a subject of\r\nconversation which Mr. Louis Jennings, writing three years later in\r\n_Field Paths and Green Lanes_, notes as dangerous if introduced too\r\nsuddenly in social circles in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut an even more remarkable political record belongs to one of Reigate's\r\nneighbours. Gatton, once a borough and now a park, had the privilege\r\ngranted to its owner in 1451 of sending two members to Parliament. The\r\nCopleys of Leigh were lords of the manor in the days of Henry VIII, and\r\nSir Richard Copley was at one time the only inhabitant of the borough,\r\nso that his voting power was considerable. When Cobbett was abroad on\r\nhis _Rural Rides_, there were Reigate, Gatton, and Bletchingley within a\r\nfew miles of one another, all of them rotten boroughs, and each of them\r\nreturning a couple of members. Cobbett, of course, boiled whenever he\r\nheard the names; Gatton in particular, was \"a very rascally spot of\r\nearth.\" He lived to see a very bad bargain for Gatton's privileges. Lord\r\nMonson, in 1830, bought the estate with its votes for two members for\r\nL100,000. Two years later, Gatton as a borough was ended by the Reform\r\nBill and all Lord Monson had for his L100,000 was the land.\r\n\r\nLord Monson started with the intention of making Gatton House one of the\r\nmost superb in the kingdom. He began with the hall, which he built on\r\nthe lines of the Corsini chapel in the church of San Giovanni in\r\nLaterano at Rome, though he did not add the dome. The floor he had laid\r\nof coloured marbles, patterned in the most delicate designs; the marble\r\nhad been designed for Ferdinand VII of Spain, and cost L10,000. The\r\nwalls and arches are as richly decorated as the floor. There are four\r\nfrescoes by Joseph Severn; Eleanor of Castile represents Fortitude;\r\nEsther, Prudence; Ruth, Meekness; Patience could only be Penelope. The\r\neffect of the shining stone and painted arches is of extraordinary\r\nbrilliance and completeness--the completeness of an unrivalled\r\ncollection. But there is somewhere something bizarre; perhaps it is the\r\nsetting. Marble demands marble neighbours, and the setting of these\r\nexotic treasures is the simple beauty of English parkland. The little\r\nchurch fits better with the great trees and the green grass. The\r\nbuilding is nothing; the interior has the grace and the light of a\r\ncathedral chapel. Lord Monson decorated Gatton Church with the\r\nmagnificence with which he imagined the hall, but his ideal for the\r\nchurch was quieter. He bought carved wood of the most exquisite\r\nworkmanship and set it wherever the church could hold it; a pulpit and\r\nan altar from Nuremberg, said to be by Duerer, but the critics dispute\r\nit; the elaborately fitted stalls came from a monastery in Ghent, and\r\naltar rails from Tongres. Glass for the windows, of deep and glowing\r\ncolours, he had from Aerschot, near Louvain; the east window, a strange\r\npainting, shows the eating of the Passover. One property the little\r\nchurch lacks; Lord Monson never gave it a wooden ceiling, and the\r\nill-shaped stone vault is too white and cold for the stalls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View from near Reigate._]\r\n\r\nThe great coaching days have many memories of Reigate. The coaches\r\nchanged horses at the Swan and the White Hart, and at the White Hart\r\nto-day's Brighton coach stops, I think, for lunch. But when Shergold\r\nwrote his _Recollections of Brighton in the Olden Time_, he speaks of\r\nthe inn at which the Brighton coach stopped in the days of the Regency\r\nas the King's Arms. Inns have a most confusing habit of changing their\r\nnames. When John Taylor, the Water Poet, in 1636, made his _Catalogue of\r\nTaverns in Ten Shires about London_, he found some seventy or eighty\r\ntaverns in Surrey, but out of the forty-nine which he mentions by name,\r\nhardly a dozen would answer to their old signboards to-day. The Reigate\r\nWhite Hart in Taylor's day was the Hart.\r\n\r\nAccording to Shergold, Reigate in the old coaching days was the scene of\r\nthe most romantic episodes imaginable. He is full of comparisons between\r\nthe easy charm of conversation among riders by coach and the ungracious\r\nsilences of travelling by rail, and this is what you read about Reigate\r\nand the fair who travelled by coach:--\r\n\r\n\"There was an advantage and an interest in travelling by coach which\r\ntravelling by rail can never communicate. In the former you saw men and\r\ntheir faces, and acquired some information; in the latter you learn\r\nnothing except the number of persons killed or injured by the last\r\naccident. A young man who entered the coach at eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning at Brighton took his seat perhaps opposite a young lady whom he\r\nthought pretty and interesting. When he arrived at Cuckfield he began to\r\nbe in love; at Crawley he was desperately smitten; at Reigate his\r\npassion became irretrievable, and when he gave her an arm to ascend the\r\nsteep ridges of Reigate Hill--a just emblem, by the way, of human\r\nlife--he declared his passion, and they were married soon after. Nothing\r\nof this sort ever occurs on railroads. Sentiment never blooms on the\r\niron soil of these sulky conveyances. A woman was a creature to be\r\nlooked at, admired, courted, and beloved in a stage-coach; but on a\r\nrailway a woman is nothing but a package, a bundle of goods committed to\r\nthe care of the railway company's servants, who take care of the poor\r\nthing as they would take care of any other bale of goods. It is said\r\nthat matches are made in heaven; it may likewise be said that matches\r\nmore often begin in the old stage-coaches, and that railroads are the\r\nantipodes of love.\"\r\n\r\nThe road from Reigate to Crawley, one of the straightest and levellest\r\nin the south country, was once the scene of a remarkable horse-race. The\r\nbeginning of it was a discussion at a shooting party in the autumn of\r\n1890 between Lord Lonsdale and Lord Shrewsbury on the pace of trotting\r\nand galloping horses. Lord Lonsdale backed himself to drive galloping\r\nhorses for twenty miles, single, pair, four-in-hand and riding\r\npostillion, inside an hour. Lord Shrewsbury wagered against him, but\r\nthere were difficulties about weather and the date--March 11, 1891--and\r\neventually Lord Shrewsbury withdrew from the match and paid L100\r\nforfeit. Lord Lonsdale then set himself the task alone, and his\r\nheadquarters were at Reigate; he had fifteen horses in training, fifteen\r\nmen and thirteen carriages, and the cost of keeping them at Reigate came\r\nto L150 a day. The course, a stretch of five miles of road, over which\r\nhorses were to be driven in the four different styles was measured from\r\nKennersley Manor, three miles south of the White Hart, nearly into\r\nCrawley. Snow fell on the tenth, the day before the match; Lord Lonsdale\r\nborrowed a snow plough and sent it over the road. At noon on the day of\r\nthe race the horses and carriages were taken to the course; at five and\r\ntwenty minutes to one Lord Lonsdale drove up in a pair-horse brougham;\r\nat one o'clock to the second he trotted his single horse, War Paint, to\r\nthe starting-point, and War Paint bounded down the road. War Paint took\r\n13 minutes 39-1/5 seconds over the five miles; it would have been twenty\r\nseconds less, but a brewer's dray had blocked the road. The pair-horse\r\nwas waiting with Blue and Yellow, two Americans, in it; the change took\r\nthree seconds, and Blue and Yellow galloped back to the start in 12\r\nminutes 51-2/5 seconds. It was the turn for the coach, and it took\r\n36-3/5 seconds to change across; a groom drove the team to the starting\r\npoint, a yard before it Lord Lonsdale caught up the reins, and the four\r\nhorses swept up the rise to Crawley again. Fifteen minutes and nine\r\nseconds and two-fifths the four horses took; the leaders were Silk and\r\nEverton King, the wheelers Conservative and Whitechapel, and they left\r\ntheir driver something over seventeen minutes to ride postillion back.\r\nIt took 40-2/5 seconds to change from coat and hat for riding, and\r\nexactly at seventeen minutes to the hour Lord Lonsdale rode off on\r\nDraper, a chestnut, with a bay mare, Violetta, for the pair. Draper and\r\nVioletta went over the last five miles in 13 minutes 55-4/5 seconds, and\r\nin 56 minutes 55-4/5 seconds the twenty miles were covered. And so the\r\ngreat race ended.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims' Way dropping down like white ribands over the shoulder of\r\nthe down into Reigate we have already seen. On the other side of the\r\ntown the high road climbs up again to the crest of the ridge--a road\r\npaved and metalled to stand the perpetual wear of shod wheels grating\r\ndown the hill. At the highest point of the road is one of the finest\r\nviews in England; one of the finest, Cobbett thought, in all the world.\r\nThe red roofs of the town cluster among trees below; beyond is all the\r\nWeald to the Devil's Dyke and Chanctonbury Ring, best of all landmarks\r\nof the Sussex downs. The separate views of the Weald along the chalk\r\nridge have each their own characteristic, from the Hog's Back to the\r\nheights above Titsey. For me the view from the hill above Reigate has a\r\ndouble memory; the purple and blue of the downs seen through the stems\r\nof the beeches that line the crest, and the shadows thrown by a high\r\nsummer sun in the parks and fields below. The oaks and elms set\r\nthemselves in the open grass with little circles of darker green about\r\ntheir feet, like the wooden stands of the trees of a Dutch toy farm.\r\n\r\nRedhill joins Reigate to the east, new, red, spreading, a junction of\r\nrailways, a better sort of Woking. You do not have to wait from nine\r\nminutes to three-quarters of an hour every time you come to Redhill. To\r\nthe schoolboy it has the merit of being a stage on the road from London\r\nand the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nCROYDON\r\n\r\n    Croydon Palace.--A Neglected Relic.--Queen Elizabeth's\r\n    Waiters.--John Whitgift.--Hospital, chapel, and school.--A Record of\r\n    Cricket.--Macaulay's tyrant.--Izaak Walton differs.--Queen\r\n    Elizabeth's Little Black Husband.--Croydon colliers.--John\r\n    Ruskin.--By the Parish Pump.--John Gilpin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCroydon is best reached by rail. It cannot be called a convenient\r\ncentre, for one returns to centres, and Croydon has little that would\r\nrecall a traveller. But it is an easy point of departure either for the\r\ncountry east, by Addington and the Kentish border, or south through\r\nSanderstead to Coulsdon and Chaldon, or west by Beddington and the\r\nCarshalton trout ponds to Epsom. You may walk in any direction, except\r\nperhaps north, where you will walk into North Croydon. But in Croydon\r\nitself there are still two or three things worth seeing.\r\n\r\nOne is the Archbishop's Palace. An Archbishop's Palace is the very last\r\nbuilding which would naturally associate itself with the Croydon tram\r\nlines and Croydon up-to-dateness, and it is the last building with which\r\nCroydon appears to wish to associate itself. The Palace stands apart\r\nfrom the bustle of the place, unhonoured, unhappy and ignored. Since the\r\nlast Archbishop left it in the reign of George II it has served its turn\r\nas business premises for a bleacher and a calico-printer; it has been a\r\nwash-house, and is now a girls' school. One thing it has never been--of\r\nsufficient interest to Croydon to be rescued from sacrilege and neglect,\r\nand to take the place which is its due among historic national\r\npossessions. Perhaps one should be thankful that the palace of Cranmer,\r\nWhitgift and Laud is to-day in no rougher hands than the gentle\r\nSisterhood of a children's day-school.\r\n\r\nIf Croydon Palace were rightly restored, how fine a relic it might be!\r\nThe great banqueting-hall, with its noble roof of Spanish chestnut,\r\nwhich has even survived the steam and chemistry of a bleacher's vats;\r\nthe long, panelled gallery where tradition has set Queen Elizabeth\r\ndancing; the guard chamber, perhaps built by Archbishop Arundell, who\r\nburnt the Lollards; the chapel with its oak stalls, its poppy-head\r\ncarvings, and the gallery added by the archbishop who stood by Charles\r\nthe First on the scaffold; if the oak were cleaned and the paint taken\r\nfrom the panels, and if under the mellow brick walls there were set out\r\nlawns and flowers; then Croydon might justly boast of its tram lines,\r\nits admirable sanitation, and its new Town Hall. It would possess\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nWhen Queen Elizabeth lay at Croydon Palace, it was not an easy matter to\r\nfind room for her train of courtiers. She came in July, 1573, to visit\r\nArchbishop Parker, and wished to come again in the following May, with a\r\nlarger train than before. The steward, entrusted with the task of\r\nfinding more room where there had never been enough, was in despair, and\r\nmade out his list of lodgings for the archbishop, or, perhaps, the\r\nQueen's chamberlain, to see. The Lord Treasurer was to be \"wher he was\";\r\nthe Lord Admiral \"at y^e nether end of the great chamber\"; the \"maydes\r\nof honnor wher they wer\"; the \"La Stafforde wher she was\"; the\r\n\"gentylmen husshers ther olde\" lodging; and so on with a very long list.\r\nBut the letter ends in a hopeless puzzle:--\r\n\r\n    \"For the Quen's Wayghters, I cannot as yet fynde anye convenyent\r\n    romes to place them in, but I will doo the best y^t I can to place\r\n    them elsewher, but yf y^t please you S^r y^t I doo remove them. The\r\n    Gromes of the Privye Chamber nor Mr. Drewrye have no other waye to\r\n    ther chambers but to pas thorowe that waye agayne that my Lady of\r\n    Oxford should come. I cannot then tell wher to place Mr. Hatton; and\r\n    for La Carewe here is no place with a chymeney for her, but that she\r\n    must ley abrode by Mrs. Aparry and the rest of y^e Prvy Chambers.\r\n    For Mrs. Shelton here is no romes with chymeneys; I shall stage one\r\n    chamber without for her. Here is as mutche as I have any wayes able\r\n    to doo in this house.\"\r\n\r\nOf the great archbishops few, strangely enough, have left memorials\r\nbehind them at Croydon. Whitgift, Grindal, and Sheldon have their\r\nmonuments in the church; of the others, Juxon added some carving to the\r\nPalace Chapel. Whitgift was the great Croydon archbishop, and did for\r\nCroydon what Abbot did for Guildford. He founded a hospital, and\r\nendowed a school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Whitgift's Hospital, Croydon._]\r\n\r\nWhitgift's Hospital stands to-day almost as its founder left it. His\r\ninitials, I.W., worked in patterned brick into a gable, and the motto he\r\nchose for the doorway, \"Qui dat pauperi nunquam indigebit,\" face a\r\nroaring thoroughfare and flaring shops, but inside the oak doors little\r\ncan have changed. Weatherbeaten red-brick, mullioned windows looking out\r\nover flowers and shaven lawns, tiled roofs and tall chimneys make up a\r\npicture of solid goodness which fits well with the archbishop's memory.\r\nThe chapel stands open, a dark, simple little place. The oak benches are\r\nthe same on which the first pensioners sat, and down upon them look\r\ncurious faded pictures, dingy in black and gold. One is a fine portrait\r\nof the founder at his writing-table, with his seal, his sandbox, a bell,\r\nquill pens and a compass (or is it a watch?). Before him lies an open\r\nLatin Bible, and he points to his favourite text--_Cast thy bread upon\r\nthe waters_. On another wall hangs a framed poem in manuscript, some\r\nforty or fifty lines of extravagance in which the archbishop is compared\r\nin turn to a straight sound cedar, a lost gem, a pearl, and a \"fairest\r\nknotlesse Plant,\" whose death forces the poet to\r\n\r\n      \"Wish, that with a Sea of teares, my Verse\r\n    Could make an Island of thy honour'd Herse.\"\r\n\r\nAnother poet writes a prodigious Latin elegy \"containing the briefest\r\nsummary of the miseries and calamities of the human race.\" A painter\r\nadds a picture of Death digging a grave.\r\n\r\nWhitgift's School is an old foundation in a modern building, and has\r\nadded a record to cricket history. Mr. V.F.S. Crawford, one of the\r\nhardest hitters of his day, was a Whitgift boy, and has done remarkable\r\nbatting as a schoolboy and since. But his most remarkable innings was\r\nplayed at Cane Hill, when he scored 180 out of 215 made while he was in,\r\nand reached his first 100 in nineteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThat the school buildings should be modern is inevitable, for the school\r\noutgrew itself forty years ago. But the school house which Whitgift\r\nbuilt was pulled down in consequence--an act which doubtless sits\r\nlightly enough on Croydon's conscience. Four years ago the Hospital\r\nnearly followed the school, the argument being that there was\r\ninsufficient room for the tram-lines.\r\n\r\nCroydon church, like nothing else in the town, became modern by\r\naccident. It was burnt down in 1867, and Sir Gilbert Scott rebuilt it\r\ninto the finest church, perhaps, in the county, next to St. Mary's,\r\nSouthwark. In the fire the tombs of the archbishops almost disappeared.\r\nGrindal's is no longer to be seen, though possibly some tumbled stones\r\ncollected into odd corners may be part of it. Sheldon's is a pile of\r\nfragments, heaped together behind a railing, charred and broken, hideous\r\nwith the sculptured skulls, bones, worms, and winged hour-glasses with\r\nwhich our ancestors grimly decked their graves. Whitgift's monument has\r\nbeen restored and is a striking example of rich and intricate\r\ndecoration, even if the pomp and colour of it are too garish for a tomb.\r\n\r\nOne looks at the stern, quiet features of his effigy and wonders what\r\nwas the truth about the man. Was he what Macaulay has called him--\"a\r\nnarrow-minded, mean, and tyrannical priest, who gained power by\r\nservility and adulation, and employed it in persecuting those who agreed\r\nwith Calvin about Church Government, and those who differed from Calvin\r\ntouching the doctrine of Reprobation.\" Could he ever have been rightly\r\ndescribed--Macaulay so describes the Master of Trinity who was to be\r\nBishop of Worcester and Archbishop of Canterbury--as \"in a chrysalis\r\nstate, putting off the worm and putting on the dragon-fly, a kind of\r\nintermediate grub between sycophant and oppressor\"? Perhaps Macaulay was\r\nnaturally unlikely to judge him well. A portrait drawn by one who lived\r\nnearer his day is Izaak Walton--another, perhaps a gentler, I.W.:--\r\n\r\n    \"He built a large Alms-house near to his own Palace at Croydon in\r\n    Surrey, and endowed it with maintenance for a Master and\r\n    twenty-eight poor men and women; which he visited so often that he\r\n    knew their names and dispositions; and was so truly humble, that he\r\n    called them Brothers and Sisters; and whensoever the Queen descended\r\n    to that lowliness to dine with him at his Palace in Lambeth,--which\r\n    was very often,--he would usually the next day show the like\r\n    lowliness to his poor Brothers and Sisters at Croydon, and dine with\r\n    them at his Hospital; at which time, you may believe there was joy\r\n    at the table.\"\r\n\r\nWalton thought him a very tactful prelate. He managed Queen Elizabeth\r\nadmirably, and \"by justifiable sacred insinuations, such as St. Paul to\r\nAgrippa--'Agrippa, believest thou? I know thou believest,' he wrought\r\nhimself into so great a degree of favour with her, as, by his pious use\r\nof it, hath got both of them a great degree of fame in this world, and\r\nof glory in that into which they are now both entered.\" Queen Elizabeth\r\nwas devoted to him, and nicknamed him \"her little black husband.\"\r\nWithout a licence from her little black husband she would not touch\r\nflesh in Lent.\r\n\r\nThe archbishops left Croydon, in 1758, when Archbishop Hutton died. The\r\nline of archbishop tenants of the Palace had been broken in the days of\r\nthe Commonwealth, when Sir William Brereton, one of the Parliamentary\r\nMajor-Generals, lived there. He was a soldier of conviction, and was\r\nnearly torn in pieces by the mob at Chester, \"for ordering a drum to be\r\nbeat for the parliament.\" Croydon's historian, Steinman, quotes from a\r\npamphlet of Cavalier days, _The Mystery of the Old Cause briefly\r\nunfolded_, a quaint appreciation of him. He was \"a notable man at a\r\nthanksgiving dinner, having terrible long teeth, and a prodigious\r\nstomach, to turn the archbishop's palace at Croydon into a kitchen, also\r\nto swallow up that palace and lands at a morsel.\" Brereton, as a reward\r\nfor his military services, had been given several sequestrated\r\nproperties, a chief forestership, and a seneschalship.\r\n\r\nFour hundred years ago, Croydon was the centre of a great Surrey\r\nindustry. The Croydon colliers were proverbial. They supplied London\r\nwith coal, that is, charcoal, before the days of \"sea-coal,\" the coal\r\nwhich blackens London smoke to-day. Then it reached London by sea. One\r\nGrimes, or Grimme, the greatest of the Croydon colliers, who lived in\r\nthe reign of Edward VI, was actually sued by an archbishop for creating\r\na nuisance with his smoke. The collier won. He was sufficiently\r\ncelebrated to become the hero of two sixteenth-century plays, one of\r\nwhich bears his name, _Grim, the Collier of Croydon_. To be \"as black as\r\na Croydon collier,\" was to be as black as a sweep; and \"a right Croydon\r\nsanguine\" was a deep red-brown.\r\n\r\nOnce Croydon, always Croydon. The first railway line built in the\r\ncountry and sanctioned by Parliament ran from Croydon to Wandsworth. It\r\nwas part of an original scheme proposed in 1799 for linking up London\r\nwith Portsmouth by an iron railroad running through Croydon, Reigate,\r\nand Arundel. But it was thought best to begin with the part which ran\r\nfrom Croydon to Wandsworth, and perhaps it was as well that the scheme\r\nwent no further, for it cost L35,000, and was a complete failure. The\r\nshareholders lost every penny. One feels it ought to have succeeded. The\r\ncarriages or trucks were drawn by horses, and the wheels ran along\r\ngrooved iron rails. Anybody who had a cart which fitted might put it on\r\nthe rails and let his horse pull it along, if he paid the tolls, which\r\nwere not heavy. However, its life was short. The Croydon canal, opened\r\nin 1809, robbed it of much of its heavy goods traffic, and the London\r\nand Brighton railway demolished it altogether. This is how \"Felix\r\nSummerley\" (his real name was Sir Henry Cole, and he liked a good walk\r\nwith a good dinner at the end of it) described the change in his\r\n_Pleasure Excursions_ in 1846.\r\n\r\n    \"A small single line, on which a miserable team of lean mules or\r\n    donkeys, some thirty years ago, might be seen crawling at the rate\r\n    of four miles in the hour, with small trucks of stone and lime\r\n    behind them.... Lean mules no longer crawl leisurely along the\r\n    little rails with trucks of stone, through Croydon, once perchance\r\n    during the day, but the whistle and rush of the locomotive, and the\r\n    whirr of the atmospheric, are now heard all day long.\"\r\n\r\nFelix Summerley must be suspected of admiring the change. One who knew\r\nold Croydon well, and admired its changes less, was John Ruskin, who had\r\nrelations there and visited them as a boy. Of one he writes in\r\n_Praeterita_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Of my father's ancestors I know nothing, nor of my mother's more\r\n    than that my maternal grandmother was the landlady of the Old King's\r\n    Head in Market Street, Croydon; and I wish she were alive again, and\r\n    I could paint her Simone Memmi's King's Head, for a sign.\"\r\n\r\nOf his aunt at Croydon he has a pleasant memory:--\r\n\r\n    \"My aunt lived in the little house still standing--or which was so\r\n    four months ago--the fashionablest in Market Street, having actually\r\n    two windows over the shop, in the second story; but I never troubled\r\n    myself about that superior part of the mansion, unless my father\r\n    happened to be making drawings in Indian ink, when I would sit\r\n    reverently by and watch; my chosen domains being, at all other\r\n    times, the shop, the bakehouse, and the stones round the spring of\r\n    crystal water at the back door (long since let down into the modern\r\n    sewer); and my chief companion, my aunt's dog, Towser, whom she had\r\n    taken pity on when he was a snappish, starved vagrant; and made a\r\n    brave and affectionate dog of: which was the kind of thing she did\r\n    for every living creature that came in her way, all her life long.\"\r\n\r\nThe Old King's Head and the fashionablest house in Market Street have\r\ngone. So has much else that Ruskin would have recognised. To guess at\r\nwhat his Croydon was like you may open Steinman's _History_ at a little\r\nengraving of Whitgift's Hospital, from a drawing made at the\r\ncross-roads. The Hospital stands as it is to-day. Opposite it, a square,\r\ntwo-storied inn stretches over the road a fine carved bracket with a\r\nbunch of grapes in iron, proclaiming that here are post horses to be had\r\nfrom Nich: Jayne. A tall-hatted rustic pensively wheels a barrow in the\r\nmiddle of the road opposite the inn; a group of villagers in stout\r\nboots, smocks and stockings stands at the street corner; and, precisely\r\non the spot where to-day's tram-lines swing north and west, a\r\nlazy-looking person in a straw hat, perhaps a sailor ashore, leans\r\nagainst a post within a yard or two of an imposing parish pump.\r\n\r\nCroydon tradition claims John Gilpin. He is said to have lived in a\r\nfarmhouse, which Croydon pulled down in 1897. It was known as Collier's\r\nWater Farm, and stood near what is now Thornton Heath Railway Station.\r\nUndoubtedly a John Gilpin lived there; but the author of the local\r\nguide-book who asserts that he was Cowper's original refers all\r\ninquirers to Dr. Brewer for corroboration; and that admirable sage\r\ninforms me that Gilpin was Mr. Beyer, an eminent linendraper of\r\nPaternoster Row.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nBEDDINGTON AND CARSHALTON\r\n\r\n    Beddington Hall.--Careful Dissipation.--The Polite Verger.--A\r\n    punning epitaph.--Actaeon and Artemis for sale.--Carshalton\r\n    pools.--A dry well.--William Quelche's Apology.--The rudeness of a\r\n    doctor.--Carshalton's greatest man.--Fighting and spelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the historians, the springs of the Wandle rose under the\r\nwalls of Croydon Palace. Croydon has seemingly decided that they shall\r\nrise further off, and the Wandle suddenly appears, full flowing, perhaps\r\na quarter of a mile away. You can walk along its bank and watch young\r\nCroydon transfer minnows from muddy water to jampots. A mile from the\r\ntown stands Beddington Hall, now an orphan asylum which sends\r\nred-cloaked children out for walks into Croydon, but once the country\r\nmansion of the great family of Carew. Nicholas Carew built a house at\r\nBeddington in the reign of Edward III, but it was Sir Francis Carew,\r\nrebuilding it under Elizabeth, who first brought greatness to\r\nBeddington. He entertained the Queen there twice, and the orange garden\r\nwas famous for many generations of Carews. When Aubrey saw the trees at\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century, he wrote that they were 'planted in\r\nthe open ground, where they have throve to admiration for above a whole\r\ncentury; but are preserved, during the winter season, under a moveable\r\nCovert.' The hard frost of 1739 killed them.\r\n\r\nA later Sir Nicholas Carew rebuilt much of the house, but retained the\r\nhall. He was an exact and particular person, and never let his careful\r\ndissipation prevent him from keeping a precise record in his account\r\nbook. One of his pocket-ledgers has found its way into the British\r\nmuseum. Here are some extracts of his expenses:--\r\n\r\n                                   L   s.  d.\r\n    Pd. my man's Nurse             -   7   -\r\n    For a Pocket-Book              1  16   -\r\n    For a smelling bottle          1   1   6\r\n    F. a table and Books           -   3   6\r\n    G.

I arrived there about\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon, and finding the doors locked, inquired\r\nof one who emerged from a stoke-hole where I might get the keys. I might\r\nnot get them, he replied; the church was being cleaned. But might I not\r\njust look round, having come a long way to see the church? I might not:\r\nshe was cleaning the reredos. Might not one who wished to write about\r\nthe church enter while she was cleaning the reredos? One might not; much\r\nhad been written of the church already. Would he be so good as to direct\r\nme to the rectory? He would, and did; and as I walked away shouted after\r\nme that the rector was certainly out. But I found him in, and very\r\ncourteous to a stranger; and I learned that, as I had hoped, the rule\r\nwas that the church should be opened every day. He gave me his card, and\r\nwrote a message on it, and with the card I went back to the church. The\r\nverger had disappeared. He was neither in the churchyard nor the\r\nstoke-hole. A stonemason working in the churchyard came to my\r\nassistance. The verger was in the church and would doubtless open the\r\ndoor if I knocked. I knocked. Nothing happened. The stonemason knocked;\r\nindeed, he knocked a great deal. I begged him to stop knocking, for\r\npassers-by stayed to see what this thing might be, but he was thoroughly\r\ninterested, and went on knocking. Perhaps he knocked for a quarter of an\r\nhour. A young girl came up to tell us that the door would certainly open\r\nbefore half-past four, for that was tea-time. Just then the door opened,\r\nand before it was shut again in our faces I just had time to brandish\r\nthe card. He replied at once--he would let me in by another door. He did\r\nso; he never asked to see the card, but went on industriously with his\r\nsweeping.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no building in Surrey has been more carefully restored than\r\nBeddington church, nor more richly decorated. The chancel with its\r\nfrescoes and mosaics, and the carved and painted roof are probably as\r\nfine as anything of the kind in any parish church. But is the result\r\nattained the result aimed at? The richness, the glamour of gold and\r\npurple and rare woods and stones are there, as they must have been in\r\nSolomon's temple. But to me the simplicity and cool quiet of aisles and\r\nwhite pillars sometimes seem to forsake such gorgeousness and glow.\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting monuments and brasses in the church,\r\nespecially in the Carew chapel, where Carews of Beddington have lain\r\nsince the fifteenth century. The strangest memorial is the punning\r\nepitaph on the steward to Sir Nicholas Carew. He died in 1633, and his\r\nname was Greenhill, which inspired his commemorator with a motto for his\r\nbrass, \"Mors super virides montes,\" and ten curious lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Vnder thy feate interrd is here\r\n    A native born in Oxfordsheere,\r\n    First, Life and Learning Oxford gaue;\r\n    Surry to him his death, his graue.\r\n    He once a HILL was, fresh and GREENE;\r\n    Now wither'd is not to bee seene.\r\n    Earth in Earth shovel'd up is shut,\r\n    A HILL into a Hole is put.\r\n    But darkesome earth by powre divine\r\n    Bright at last as ye Sonne may shine.\"\r\n\r\nA mile further west, beyond Wallington, which in spite of embracing\r\nvilladom still keeps an old inn and a pretty, shaded green, is\r\nCarshalton. Carshalton begins magnificently. In the spacious days of\r\nKing George the First there was designed for Carshalton Park a superb\r\ndwelling, which Leoni was to have built for the lord of the manor (he\r\nbuilt the Onslow house in Clandon Park). But the house was never built.\r\nThe gates remain. They formerly guarded the green glades of a deer park.\r\nNow they stand forlornly cheek by jowl with new yellow brick. Actaeon,\r\nfrom one great pillar, gazes on less divine pictures than a goddess\r\nbathing; Artemis, on the other pillar, drapes herself for unseeing eyes.\r\nA papered notice-board lolls against the superb ironwork of the gates.\r\nHunter and huntress, pillars and wrought iron, are for sale.\r\n\r\nFew villages in Surrey are prettier to-day than they were forty years\r\nago. Carshalton is hardly a village, but is it less pretty than it used\r\nto be? Let Ruskin decide, from the opening of _The Crown of Wild Olive_.\r\n\r\n    \"Twenty years ago\" (he writes in 1870) \"there was no lovelier piece\r\n    of lowland scenery in South England, nor any more pathetic, in the\r\n    world, by its expression of sweet human character and life, than\r\n    that immediately bordering on the sources of the Wandel, and\r\n    including the low moors of Addington, and the villages of Beddington\r\n    and Carshalton, with all their pools and streams. No clearer or\r\n    diviner waters ever sang with constant lips of the hand which\r\n    'giveth rain from heaven'; no pastures ever lightened in spring-time\r\n    with more passionate blossoming; no sweeter homes ever hallowed the\r\n    heart of the passer-by with their pride of peaceful\r\n    gladness,--half-hidden--yet full-confessed. The place remains (1870)\r\n    nearly unchanged in its larger features; but with deliberate mind I\r\n    say, that I have never seen anything so ghastly in its inner tragic\r\n    meaning,--not in Pisan Maremma--not by Campagna tomb,--not by the\r\n    sand-isles of the Torcellan shore,--as the slow stealing of aspects\r\n    of reckless, indolent, animal neglect, over the delicate sweetness\r\n    of the English scene: nor is any blasphemy or impiety, any frantic\r\n    saying, or godless thought, more appalling to me, using the best\r\n    power of judgment I have to discern its sense and scope, than the\r\n    insolent defiling of those springs by the human herds that drink of\r\n    them. Just where the welling of stainless water, trembling and pure,\r\n    like a body of light, enters the pool of Carshalton, cutting itself\r\n    a radiant channel down to the gravel, through warp of feathery\r\n    weeds, all waving, which it traverses with its deep threads of\r\n    clearness, like the chalcedony in moss-agate, starred here and there\r\n    with the white grenouillette; just in the very rush and murmur of\r\n    the first spreading currents, the human wretches of the place cast\r\n    their street and house foulness; heaps of dust and slime, and broken\r\n    shreds of old metal, and rags of putrid clothes; which, having\r\n    neither energy to cart away, nor decency enough to dig into the\r\n    ground, they thus shed into the stream, to diffuse what venom of it\r\n    will float and melt, far away, in all places where God meant those\r\n    waters to bring joy and health. And, in a little pool behind some\r\n    houses farther in the village, where another spring rises, the\r\n    shattered stones of the well, and of the little fretted channel\r\n    which was long ago built and traced for it by gentler hands, lie\r\n    scattered, each from each, under a ragged bank of mortar, and\r\n    scoria, and bricklayer's refuse, on one side, which the clean water\r\n    nevertheless chastises to purity; but it cannot conquer the dead\r\n    earth beyond: and there, circled and coiled under festering scum,\r\n    the stagnant edge of the pool effaces itself into a slope of black\r\n    slime, the accumulation of indolent years. Half-a-dozen men with one\r\n    day's work could cleanse those pools, and trim the flowers about\r\n    their banks, and make every breath of summer air above them rich\r\n    with cool balm; and every glittering wave medicinal, as if it ran,\r\n    troubled only of angels, from the porch of Bethesda. But that day's\r\n    work is never given, nor, I suppose, will be; nor will any joy be\r\n    possible to heart of man, for evermore, about those wells of English\r\n    waters.\"\r\n\r\nThings are not quite so bad to-day. Ruskin himself had the smaller pool\r\ncleaned and set about with stone, and planted with periwinkle and\r\ndaffodils. The other two larger pools are the care of a district\r\ncouncil, which forbids attempts to catch the big trout that cruise in\r\ntheir clear, weedy waters, and otherwise looks after them for a public\r\nwhich may value them more highly than in Ruskin's day, but drops in a\r\ngreat many newspapers. Another so-called well--Anne Boleyn's well; her\r\nhorse put its foot into soft ground above a spring--is a well no longer.\r\nIron railings ward off the profane, and narcissus and ivy cluster round\r\nits brim, but below, according to the weather, is dust or mud.\r\n\r\nAt the churchyard gate are the trunks of two ancient but still living\r\nelms, to which is fastened a beam beset with hooks, which either hold or\r\nonce held joints of meat for the butcher's shop behind. The church,\r\nwhich is a strange mixture of old and new, the new being gradually built\r\non to the old, is the resting-place of Gaynesfordes and Ellenbrygges,\r\ntwo of the great old Surrey families, and contains at least one\r\nremarkable inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"M.S. Under the middle stone that guards the ashes of a certain\r\n    fryer, sometime vicar of this place, is raked up the dust of William\r\n    Quelche, B.D., who ministred in the same since the reformation. His\r\n    lot was through God's mercy to burn incense here about 30 years, and\r\n    ended his course Aprill the 10, an. dni 1654, being aged 64 years.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Quelche was vicar in troublous times, and the distractions of the\r\nCivil War led to a hiatus in the parish registers. The fault lay with\r\nthe parish clerk, but the conscientious Mr. Quelche felt bound to clear\r\nhimself in the eyes of future ages by a long apology in the Register of\r\nbaptisms, which begins beseechingly enough:--\r\n\r\n    \"Good Reader tread gently:\r\n\r\n    For though these vacant yeares may seeme to make me guilty of thy\r\n    censure, neither will I symply excuse myselfe from all blemishe; yet\r\n    if thou doe but cast thine eie uppon the former pages and se with\r\n    what care I have kepte the annalls of mine owne tyme, and rectifyed\r\n    sundry errors of former times thou wilt beginn to thinke ther is\r\n    some reason why he that begann to build so well should not be able\r\n    to make an ende.\"\r\n\r\nBut the entries for the years before the war broke out were occasionally\r\na little vague. Here are three full years' records of marriages:--\r\n\r\n    \"1640. A Londoner married mr. Kepps sister of micham on Easter\r\n    monday.\r\n\r\n    1641. Mr. Meece married a couple who came from fishsted whose names\r\n    he could not remember.\r\n\r\n    1642. Not one marryed woe to y^e vicar.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the names and surnames sound odd:--\r\n\r\n    Epaphroditus wood.  Epaphroditus Wandling.  Anne Waweker.\r\n\r\n    Hevedebar Hill.  Wroe.  Buttonshere.  Dilcock.\r\n\r\n    Gander.   Mustian.   Thunderman.   Nep.   Milfe.\r\n\r\nCarshalton House, a massive pile of red brick, was built by Sir John\r\nFellowes, one of the directors of the South Sea Bubble. It stands on the\r\nsite of a house which belonged to the most famous doctor of his day. He\r\nwas John Radcliffe, founder of the Radcliffe Library, and so much run\r\nafter as a physician that he felt able to be intolerably rude to his\r\npatients, even if they happened to be kings and queens. William the\r\nThird never forgave him for telling him that he would not own his\r\nMajesty's dropsical legs for the three kingdoms. Queen Anne refused to\r\nmake him her court physician, but sent for him when she was dying. He\r\nwould not leave Carshalton, pleading the gout; and he lived and died in\r\nangry remorse. The Queen never recovered, and the doctor did not dare to\r\nshow his face in London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sutton._]\r\n\r\nCarshalton's greatest man lies in a nameless grave. Admiral Sir Edward\r\nWhitaker, leader of the assault which first made Gibraltar a British\r\nfortress, used to spend his summers at Carshalton, and was buried in\r\nCarshalton churchyard, but the slab which marked his grave was moved\r\nand lost when the church was enlarged. He was forty-four when with\r\nCaptain Jumper and Captain Hicks he led his men against the redoubt, and\r\nhe was as brilliant a fighter as he was a poor speller. I quote from a\r\nletter he wrote describing the siege and assault to his friend Sir\r\nRichard Haddock, Comptroller of the Navy, a day or two after the\r\naction:--\r\n\r\n    \"There was three small ships in the old mold, one of which annoyed\r\n    our camp by firing amongst them. One having about 10 guns, lying\r\n    close to the mold, and just under a great bastion at the north\r\n    corner of the towne, I proposed to Sir George the burning her in the\r\n    night. He liked itt: accordingly ordered what boats I would have to\r\n    my assistance: and about 12 at night I did itt effectually, w^th the\r\n    loss of but one man, and 5 or 6 wounded.\r\n\r\n    _July 23._--At 4 this morning, adm^l Byng began w^th his ships to\r\n    cannonade, a Dutch rear-adm^l and 5 or 6 ships of thairs along w^th\r\n    him, w^ch made a noble noise, being within half shott of the town.\r\n    My ship, not being upon service, I desired Sir George to make me his\r\n    _aducon_ to carry his commands, from tyme to tyme, to adm^l Byng,\r\n    which he did....\r\n\r\n    P.S. This is rite all in a hurry, sir, y^t I hope you'le excuse me.\"\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp had not forgotten the concluding formula of the\r\nschoolboy complete letter-writer.\r\n\r\nBeyond Carshalton is Sutton, not less exuberant than Croydon. The Cock\r\nHotel of coaching days has been rebuilt; the railway is convenient for\r\nEpsom or London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nCHALDON TO THE DOWNS\r\n\r\n    Coulsdon.--A giant Christian prince.--Chaldon.--The Ladder of\r\n    Life.--The Brig of Whinney Moor.--Chipstead.--Merstham.--A Wizard\r\n    Rector.--Addington.--The little churches.--Horne Tooke's\r\n    _Diversions_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to escape from Croydon's railway-stations. You can push\r\nout from its ringing streets into green and quiet country, and find\r\nlittle old churches within a mile or two of the railway, as undisturbed\r\nas if no railway were yet running. You may leave the line at Purley, and\r\nwithin an hour's walk find yourself in the wind on the downs, among\r\nAnglo-Saxon barrows and immemorial yews; you may even be able (though\r\nnot without thought) to exclude from a generous view of hill and valley\r\nthe enormous lunatic asylums which fate and County Councils have piled\r\nand multiplied in this part of Surrey.\r\n\r\nThere is a strip of country lying south of Purley in which you cannot\r\nget more than a mile and a half or so from the railway, but which\r\ncontains tiny hamlets and lonely roads. Purley and Kenley will one day\r\ncome out to Coulsdon, perhaps, but Coulsdon's day is not yet. The\r\nvillage itself is nothing more than a cottage or two with a church. But\r\nthe road to Coulsdon opens on broad slopes of grass and plough, bordered\r\nwith a line of yews--an ancient trackway, perhaps. Such a line, or\r\nrather lines, for there are several along the sides of the downs a\r\nlittle further south, would certainly be claimed as evidence of a\r\n\"pilgrims' way\" if they ran east and west between Guildford, say, and\r\nDorking. Fields with such noble hedges to define them have their own air\r\nof wildness and age; it is easy enough, even with Purley slate roofs\r\nhardly a mile away, to fancy partridges calling across those open\r\nspaces. Coulsdon, indeed, was once celebrated for its game. Aubrey tells\r\nus that in the parish there was \"a large coney-warren belonging to the\r\nDesbouveries.\" They, for many years under Stuarts and Georges, were\r\nlords of the manor.\r\n\r\nFrom Coulsdon one may walk to Chaldon over Farthing Down. The horizon\r\nchanges, but Farthing Down itself remains high and free, smooth with\r\nshort down grass, and dinted with the hoofs of galloping horses. Croydon\r\nand Purley send many riders abroad on Saturdays and Sundays. But\r\nFarthing Down is peopled with other older forms. Along the ridge,\r\nbordering the ancient trackways, lies a line of barrows. They were\r\nopened in 1872 by Mr. John Wickham Flower; some were found untouched,\r\nand contained perfect skeletons. In one grave lay the bones of a great\r\nlady; buried with her was a beautiful wooden drinking-cup, its staves\r\nfastened by bronze bands of an intricate Runic pattern of coiled snakes.\r\nAnother grave held the skeleton of a warrior giant, his sword lying\r\nacross him and the boss of his shield upon his foot. Mr. Flower thinks\r\nhe can add a name. Coulsdon is a corruption of Cuthredesdune, and\r\nperhaps Cuthred, an Anglo-Saxon prince, lies buried here with his\r\nfamily. Cuthred, son of Cwichelm, and grandson of Cynegils, the first\r\nChristian king of Wessex, was baptised in 639 at Dorchester.\r\n\r\nFarthing Down stretches for nearly three miles north and south, and\r\nunder its southern slope lies the little village of Chaldon. Chaldon\r\nchurch holds the most remarkable wall-painting in the country. The\r\n\"Ladder of Life,\" or \"Ladder of Salvation,\" is the subject, and it\r\noccupies nearly the whole of the west wall of the church. In red and\r\nwhite and yellow ochre paint you are shown the torments of the damned,\r\nthe salvation of heaven, the trampling of Satan. A ladder rises through\r\nthe middle; up it the poor souls of men struggle to the joys above; some\r\ntumble headlong; a demon picks off others with a pitchfork and sets them\r\naside to burn or boil. An enormous dog eats a woman's hand; in life she\r\nhad thrown to dogs what she should have given to the poor. A usurer\r\npainted without eyes, for usurers could not weep, sits among flames;\r\ndevils drive pitchforks into his head, moneybags hang round his neck, he\r\ncounts and swallows red hot coins. Other hapless souls, condemned to\r\nwalk a bridge of spikes, carry burdens over a thin plank like a saw set\r\non edge. Above is a nimbus of clouds, and above the nimbus, the weighing\r\nof souls. The archangel Michael balances the souls in great scales; a\r\nfiend tries to make them kick the beam. On the other side is the\r\nHarrowing of Hell. Hell is the mouth of a monstrous devil; Christ\r\nadvances with the cross and banner, and thrusts the wood of the cross\r\ninto the devil's mouth. The souls rise up delivered from purgatory;\r\nabove them, a flying angel floats with a scroll. Mr. J.G. Waller,\r\nwriting in the _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, explains most of the\r\npainting, but has hardly a guess for the scroll. \"The heavens depart, as\r\nit were a scroll rolled together;\" Mr. Waller does not mention the text\r\nwhich to the layman seems obvious but the expert may have reasons\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the Bridge--the walking over a sharp edge, set with\r\nspikes or narrow as a hair--is one of the oldest things of all the\r\nreligions. The Chinese had it, in the distant Eastern ages, and Mr.\r\nWaller, in the _Collections_, prints verses which show it surviving in\r\nYorkshire in 1624. There was a Yorkshire tradition that a person after\r\ndeath must pass over Whinney Moor; and at a funeral it was the custom\r\nfor a woman to come and chant verses over the corpse. These are an\r\nextract:--\r\n\r\n    When thou from hence doest pass away,\r\n        Every night and awle,\r\n    To Whinney Moor thou com'st at last,\r\n        And Christ receive thy sawle.\r\n\r\n    From Whinney Moor that thou mayest pass,\r\n        Every night and awle,\r\n    To Brig of dread thou com'st at last,\r\n        And Christ receive thy sawle.\r\n    From Brig of dread, na brader than a thread,\r\n        Every night and awle,\r\n    To Purgatory fire thou com'st at last,\r\n        And Christ receive thy sawle.\r\n\r\nEast of Chaldon is Caterham, west is Chipstead and south-west is\r\nMerstham, each two miles or so away as the crow flies and something more\r\nas the road runs, and each with a railway station. Caterham once was a\r\nvalley; Aubrey wrote of it: \"In this parish are many pleasant little\r\nvallies, stored with wild thyme, sweet marjoram, barnell, boscage, and\r\nbeeches.\" I do not know barnell, but the last twenty years have set\r\nmany houses among the boscage. They have built, too, two new churches,\r\none of them set very finely on a hill; the old church is disused, or\r\nused, rather, only for a Sunday school. Upon Sunday scholars, from a\r\nNorman wall, looks down a hideous stone corbel. A clown's face stretches\r\na devil's mouth wide open with hands like rat's paws; the sharp teeth\r\ngrin like rat's teeth; perhaps in the Sunday school they make their own\r\nfaces at it.\r\n\r\nChipstead, to the west, is on a hill the other side of the railway. It\r\nhas some pretty modern cottages by a pond and shading elm-trees; a\r\npost-office also, with the smallest possible aperture for introducing\r\nletters to the notice of the post-mistress within. The church has some\r\nquaint features; there are a number of oddly shaped lancet windows, a\r\ncuriously carved boss in the groining of the tower, and a strange\r\narrangement by which the members of the choir sit facing the east with\r\ntheir backs to the pulpit. In the churchyard lies Sir Edward Banks,\r\nperhaps Chipstead's most illustrious native. He was born poor and he\r\ndied rich; and he built three great bridges, Waterloo, Southwark, and\r\nLondon. Chipstead churchyard, too, has a fine yew; but good yews are\r\ncommon in the churchyards south of Croydon.\r\n\r\nThe best walk from Chaldon is over the hill to Merstham; the sign-posts\r\nshow you the path and mark it \"The Pilgrims' Way\" to Tollsworth Farm\r\nwith the utmost assurance. From Tollsworth Farm the path drops over a\r\nplough down the side of the hill; before the railway and the tunnel came\r\nthe old Way perhaps went straight across to the church. Merstham itself\r\nhas little to show except one pretty little side street; but the church\r\nis more full of curiosities than any other near. Its builders placed it\r\ndelightfully on a mound which is all air and sunlight, and though much\r\nof the charm of the church was destroyed in 1861, much that is old and\r\ncurious remains. A queerly placed clock tells the time low down on the\r\ntower; inside are ancient monuments, one a stone effigy recovered from\r\nuse as a pavement, others to the Elinbrygge family. That is only one\r\nspelling of the name, and perhaps as good as any other; variations are\r\nElinebrigge, Elyngbrigge, Elinerugge, Ellerug, Elmerugge, Elmebrugge,\r\nElmridge, Elmbrige, Elmebrygge, Ellmbridge, Elinrugge, Ellyngbrugg,\r\nElenbrig, Elingbrig, Ellyngbrigg, and Ellynbrege. An Elinbrygge in those\r\ndays could spell practically anything. Other memorials are fragments of\r\nstone carving, once belonging to the Southcotes and Waldegraves, and\r\nbuilt without reason into windows and walls. Over the west chancel arch\r\nis a broken piece of carving from old London Bridge; and forlornest\r\npossession of all, the north chantry is paved with a tessellated floor\r\nwhich was made in prison, I was told, by an unhappy woman who hoped that\r\nforgiveness would take and use her work. Merstham has had some famous\r\nrectors. One was the great Thomas Linacre, King's Physician to Henry VII\r\nand Henry VIII, founder of the Royal College of Physicians, and friend\r\nof Melanchthon and Erasmus. He became a priest when he was fifty-eight,\r\nfour years before his death, and was only Rector of Merstham for a\r\nmonth. \"I much wonder,\" Fuller writes of him in his _Worthies_, \"at what\r\nI find in good authors, that Linacre a little before his death turned\r\npriest and began to study the Scriptures with which he was formerly\r\nunacquainted, in so much that reading the fifth, sixth and seventh\r\nchapters of St. Matthew he vowed, '_That_ either this was not the Gospel\r\nor we were not Christians.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother rector, Robert Cole, once was a nonconformist, especially in the\r\nmatter of ecclesiastical vestments, but eventually got rid of his\r\nobjections. Ecclesiastical Commissioners then decided to have an object\r\nlesson in properly dressed clergymen at Lambeth. Mr. Cole was dressed in\r\nfull clerical attire, and was then \"placed as the front figure at the\r\nmeeting, while the chancellor of the Bishop of London thus harangued the\r\nauditory: 'My masters and the ministers of London, the Council's\r\npleasure is, that ye strictly keep the unity of apparel, like to this\r\nman as you now see him; that is, a square cap, a scholar's gown,\r\npriestlike, a tippet, and in the church a linen surplice.'\" The auditors\r\nthen had to sign \"Volo\" or \"Nolo,\" and those who refused were deprived\r\nof their livings. Poor Mr. Cole, priestlike in his tippet, cuts a meeker\r\nfigure than another Merstham rector, James Samborne. This reverend\r\ngentleman was actually supposed to possess supernatural powers, and when\r\na thief climbed up a pear-tree in the rectory orchard, Mr. Samborne went\r\nin pursuit, fixed his gaze upon the robber from a suitable distance and\r\nfrom where he stood, using dreadful arts, fastened the robber in the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nAnother walk from Croydon, for those who like a string of little old\r\nchurches, and an occasional fine view, would be by Addington to the\r\nsouth-east through Sanderstead to Warlingham, or further south to the\r\nedge of the chalk ridge at Woldingham. The railway is never very far\r\noff. There is nothing imposing among these hillside hamlets; they leave\r\nan impression of tiny villages which felt their first need to be a\r\nchurch; the congregations must have been small and poor. They, of the\r\nSurrey churches, are nearest in heart to the \"little, lost down\r\nchurches\" of Sussex and Mr. Kipling's most magical poem.\r\n\r\nAddington, perhaps, could hardly be called lost, for many archbishops\r\nhave lived at Addington Park, and two lie buried in the churchyard,\r\nArchbishop Longley and Archbishop Tait. There are memorials to three\r\nothers--Manners-Sutton, Howleigh, and Sumner. But the most attractive\r\nname on the church walls belongs to the wife of the builder of Addington\r\nHouse. She was Mrs. Grizzel Trecothick. Addington still lies in deep\r\ncountry; Sanderstead, its neighbour three miles to the south-west, is\r\nhalf in the country and half in the town. Old Sanderstead, the Sandy\r\nPlace, has a large, square red-brick house overlooking a park and a\r\nquiet churchyard, where the little church, with sloping roofs over each\r\naisle, looks rather like a hen brooding chickens. In the chancel is a\r\nmemorial to one of those squires who held strange offices under Tudor\r\nkings. He kneels in painted marble, and he was \"John Ownsted, esquier,\r\nservant to y^e most excellent princesse and our dread soveraigne Queene\r\nElizabeth, and seriant of her ma^ties cariage by y^e space of 40 yeres.\"\r\nSouth-east of Sanderstead are Farley and Chelsham, each with an old\r\nchurch; Farley's is a tiny building by a fine farmyard, but the peace of\r\nthe little church is gone; its modest spire, as you walk to the\r\nchurchyard, is dominated and affronted by the hideous clock-tower of a\r\nneighbouring lunatic asylum. Why should such a thing be? County Councils\r\nhave decreed that in this part of Surrey must be massed together the\r\nthousands of poor souls who have lost the reason which county\r\ncouncillors must be supposed to possess; but why insist on their unhappy\r\npresence? A building to hold such sadness should be a quiet thing,\r\nhidden among trees, silent, alone. But that would suit neither\r\ncouncillors nor architects. For them, asylums must stare, scar, insist\r\nthat they will be seen and known; and here, in what should be tranquil\r\nand lovely country, they violate the hills.\r\n\r\nTwo other villages, Warlingham and Woldingham, lie east of the railway.\r\nWarlingham stands round a pretty green, and has a pleasant inn; the\r\nchurch, which once lay among fields, is at the end of a chestnut avenue\r\nwhich belongs to the future. It is a curious little building, with a\r\nsense of wide light and cool stone, and has been beautifully restored by\r\nMr. Philip Mainwaring Johnston, who discovered, and has admirably\r\npreserved, a particularly interesting low-side window with a circular\r\nniche in the chancel. Woldingham, right on the edge of the chalk ridge,\r\nhas a tiny church set apart among the fields; nearer the village, a\r\npretty wooden chapel--almost the only pretty wooden chapel I have seen.\r\nBut the best of Woldingham is the broad and breezy grass plateau on\r\nwhich it stands. On a clear day you may see London; a better view to the\r\nsouth is blocked by new buildings and gardens.\r\n\r\nThe railway returns to Purley and Croydon; Purley, where Tooke lived,\r\nand gave his name to Horne Tooke, with eight thousand pounds, for\r\nwinning him a lawsuit. From Purley Horne Tooke named his _Diversions_;\r\nthey may have diverted him, but if they did, he could be moved to mirth\r\nby a very dreary business indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nHORLEY AND CHARLWOOD\r\n\r\n    Restored church windows.--A Cow for an apprentice.--A Horley\r\n    eleven.--Thunderfield Castle.--Horne.--Outwood Common.--A daring\r\n    jump.--Over the Green.--Burstow's Astronomer.--Causies.--St.\r\n    Margaret and the Devil.--A Country Sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The pretty village and church of Horley\" is the opening of a\r\ndescriptive paragraph in a Surrey guide-book not thirty years old.\r\nHorley is more than a village and a little less than pretty to-day. But\r\nit has two good old-fashioned country inns, and it is a convenient\r\ncentre to some interesting country. It contains in itself little of\r\ninterest except the church, which has a fine tower; but which is one of\r\nthe unhappiest examples of unintelligent \"restoration.\" The story of the\r\n\"restoration\" is, indeed, hardly credible. In 1877 the Surrey\r\nArchaeological Society visited the church, and Major Heales wrote an\r\nadmirable paper on its architecture, particularly drawing attention to\r\nthe beauty of the windows in the north aisle, which dated from 1310, and\r\ncontained some rare deep ruby glass. He described the tracery as the\r\nmost beautiful in the county. Yet within five years the church was\r\n\"restored\"; the windows, which were in excellent preservation and would\r\nhave lasted another five hundred years, were destroyed, every stone of\r\nthem; and the glass had disappeared, either broken up or sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The \"Six Bells\" Inn, Horley._]\r\n\r\nHorley parish registers have some pleasant entries. Stray daughters, who\r\nate too much at home and otherwise were hard to look after, used to be\r\napprenticed to persons who would undertake, for a consideration, to keep\r\nthem until they were twenty-one. The consideration might be in cash or\r\nin kind. Thus, Jeremy Shoe, on January 13, 1604, took An Chamley,\r\ndaughter of Edmund Chamley, deceased, apprentice \"until she come to xxj,\r\nin consideracon he receives some household stuffe to the valew of vj^s\r\nviij^d and is to be eased in not paying to the poore for iiij yeares to\r\ncome.\" John Chelsham had a better bargain, for he agreed to take An\r\nWilliams till she came to twenty-one, and had from her father \"one mare\r\nand a colte in full satisfaction.\" Sometimes the apprentices were bound\r\neven longer. Susan Washfoord was bound to Bernard Humphry, and he\r\nundertook \"to keep her sufficient meate, drink, and apparell until she\r\ncome to the age of fower and twenty yeares.\" Susan's mother was a widow,\r\nand she paid to get rid of her daughter a cow and twenty shillings from\r\nthe churchwardens.\r\n\r\nNot many Surrey towns or villages can boast a family cricket eleven.\r\nHorley can. Eleven Watneys of Horley have played frequent matches\r\nagainst local clubs, and against eleven Wigans of Mortlake. Mr. F.S.\r\nAshley-Cooper has collected some other instances of family cricket teams\r\nin the county. Eleven Bacons, a father and ten sons, played eleven\r\npostmen at Thornton Heath in 1895, but were beaten by the postmen. In\r\n1877 eleven Mitchells played eleven Heaths on Shalford Common. The\r\nHeaths all belonged to the same family, but the Mitchells were only\r\nrelations. Eleven Lovells played a match at Tulse Hill in 1901, but had\r\nmuch the worst of it; and, most famous name of all, twelve Caesars of\r\nGodalming, three fathers and their nine sons, once played the Gentlemen\r\nof the District. The family luck was no better; they lost by 16 runs.\r\n\r\nHardly a mile to the south-east of Horley lies an enigma--Thunderfield\r\nCastle. There is no castle; perhaps there never was one. A moat of brown\r\nwater, splashed with white duck-feathers; an irregular mound beyond,\r\nthick with brushwood, and an ordinary set of farm-buildings through a\r\ngate to the side--that is all that is to be seen of the castle to-day.\r\nWas it an old British camp? Almost certainly not, nor a Roman camp. Mr.\r\nMalden, the Surrey historian, thinks it may have been one of the\r\nnumberless castles built by the quarrelsome de Clares to annoy the\r\nequally quarrelsome de Warennes. Perhaps it was built in the days when\r\ncastles sprang up like mushrooms; and perhaps it was demolished when\r\ndemolitions were so frequent that one more or less was never noticed. It\r\nmay have had a stone keep, but nobody can tell whether it had or not\r\nunless he excavates the ground within the moat, and that is a task which\r\nnobody, apparently, desires to try.\r\n\r\nAnother mile and a half along the west road from Horley leads to\r\nSmallfield Place, once the manor-house of the Bysshe family, afterwards\r\na farmhouse, and now a private residence, with the Jacobean part of the\r\nold house apparently well worked in with the new. Further, by another\r\nmile, is the tiny village of Horne, not much more than a school, a\r\nchurch, and an old cottage or two. In such a simple, open-air little\r\nplace it was attractive to see, on a hot September day when I was there,\r\na ring of schoolchildren being given their lessons out of doors in the\r\nshade. Horne is one of those little villages in which, when the busy,\r\npleasant hum of the children's school first comes down the wind, you\r\nwonder where the children spring from. It does not look as if there were\r\nenough cottages within walking distance to provide a class, much less\r\nfour or five standards--if that is the correct expression. Horne is,\r\nindeed, one of the most out-of-the-way little places in this part of the\r\ncounty. But it makes a satisfactory objective for a walk from Horley,\r\nand its small church contains at least two memorials of interest. One is\r\nan elaborate piece of wood-carving, painted to look like marble, which\r\ncommemorates John Goodwine, who died when James I was king; the other is\r\nan ingenious model of the church itself, as it stood before restoration.\r\nThe restorers altered the interior pretty thoroughly; but the old church\r\nmust have been a curious building. It had a long, large window on the\r\nroof, especially let in to throw light on the hymn-books of the\r\nmusicians in the gallery. How was such a window cleaned?\r\n\r\nWalking in this part of Surrey, which is chiefly pasture, is apt to be a\r\nlittle monotonous, without a good view. One of the prettiest views near\r\nHorne is at Outwood, a little more than a mile to the north-west, on the\r\nway back to Horley. Outwood Common is delightful. Two great windmills,\r\nblack and white, spread sails to the blowing air; below them, black and\r\nwhite like the mills, pigs nose quietly over the short grass, and geese\r\nstrut cackling. To the north, beyond rich and tranquil fields, lie the\r\ngrey-green wooded hills by Bletchingley and Nutfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Windmills at Outwood._]\r\n\r\nHorne is pretty near the centre of the country of the Burstow foxhounds,\r\nwhich stretches from Leigh, the other side of Horley, to Edenbridge in\r\nKent. Two good stories are told of White, the Burstow huntsman. One is\r\nof an extraordinary jump, singular not for its height or the width of\r\nground covered, but for its daring and adroitness. It was on one of\r\nthe best days the Burstow ever had, when they killed a fox at Crawley\r\nafter an hour and ten minutes' run almost without a check; and went on\r\nto find another fox near New Chapel Green, which hounds ate in Kent at\r\nhalf-past five, nobody knows quite where, so bad was the light. Nearly\r\nat the end of the second run White found himself on the edge of a\r\nnarrow, deep ghyll, with a stream at the bottom, crossed by an overgrown\r\nfootpath which went down to the stream and up again by flights of stone\r\nsteps opposite each other. Riding down two or three of the steps, he\r\ntook a standing jump over the stream and landed on the top steps the\r\nother side. On another occasion his daring was of a different kind; he\r\ndid not know where he was riding. Hounds had crossed the golf links on\r\nEarlswood Common, and White, close behind them, was riding straight for\r\none of the greens. A member of the hunt shouted to warn him, but White,\r\nwho had not the slightest notion what was meant, galloped straight over\r\nthe green, turning round to point at the hole and shout to the hunt,\r\n\"Ware hole! ware hole!\"\r\n\r\nBurstow itself, hidden among pines, has named the hounds, but has not a\r\nlarge part in Surrey history. One of its rectors, the Rev. J. Flamsteed,\r\nwho is buried in the church, was the first Astronomer Royal. Charles II\r\nmade him that, when he was twenty-nine; nine years later he took orders,\r\nand went on astronomising till his death. Newton helped him and\r\nquarrelled with him over the publication of his observations; but it was\r\nsomething, even in the days of Charles II, to be made Astronomer Royal\r\nwhen Newton was alive.\r\n\r\nThree miles on the other side of Horley lies Charlwood, once a wholly\r\nrestful little village, but of late years stiffened and discoloured by\r\nthe building contractor. The centre street of the village, near the\r\nchurch, is quaintly arched by a pair of elm trees, cropped and pollarded\r\nto meet overhead. Elms are not often selected for experiments in\r\ntopiary. But Charlwood has more than one feature peculiar to itself, or\r\nat all events to the district. The village lies deep in Wealden clay,\r\nwhich can grow luxuriant roses, but which in days when Surrey roads were\r\nless well laid made getting about in the winter rains a matter of\r\ndifficulty for those who could not drive. So those who walked made their\r\nown paths, which can be seen running along the side of most of the\r\nroads in the neighbourhood. \"Causies\" is the local name for these\r\ncauseways, which are single slabs of flat stone set like stepping stones\r\nin the clay, sometimes for miles together. The villagers tell you that\r\nthey have been there since no one knows when. They may be right, but\r\ntheir probable date is the middle of the seventeenth century, when John\r\nGainsford, as we shall see, was making a causeway like these at\r\nCrowhurst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Charlwood._]\r\n\r\nA very curious set of wall paintings portrays, in the south aisle of\r\nCharlwood church, the legend of St. Margaret. St. Margaret was a virgin\r\nand a martyr, a most popular saint in the middle ages, and the heroine\r\nof a remarkable story. She was the daughter of a pagan priest at\r\nAntioch, and since she was a weak child, she was sent into the country\r\nfor fresh air. Her nurse brought her up as a Christian, and when she was\r\nolder she was sent into the fields to mind sheep. One day the governor\r\nof Antioch, whose name was Olibrius, was out hunting, saw the pretty\r\nshepherdess, fell in love with her at sight, and offered her his hand in\r\nmarriage on the spot. St. Margaret refused him; she might not wed with a\r\npagan. Olibrius was furious. He seized the poor shepherdess, beat her\r\ncruelly, and threw her into prison; even there she was not safe. The\r\ndevil himself came after her in the form of a dragon, entered the prison\r\nand swallowed the saint whole, as you may see in the picture. However,\r\nProvidence intervened, and by a miracle she escaped from the dragon's\r\nbody. Evidently Providence then gave up helping, for Olibrius succeeded\r\nwhere the devil had failed. He ordered her head off at once, and the\r\nartist has painted her soul flying to heaven in the form of a dove.\r\n\r\nAnother painting sets out a commoner story, the allegory of the Three\r\nLiving and the Three Dead. Three kings ride out hunting in the forest,\r\nand are met by three ghastly spectres, who lecture them on the vanity of\r\nthis world's pomps and pleasures. I should think this used to be a\r\nfavourite. It must have been vastly comforting to the poor, and pretty\r\neasy, too, for the parson. Anybody could make a sermon on the sufferings\r\nin store for kings and other rich people, and the way they go out\r\nhunting and shooting and not caring for anybody, and then the spectres\r\ncome at them and they see how empty life is. Even to-day those ruddled\r\ndrawings can set a spell. Stare at them, and the little church calls\r\nback its preacher and his flock; there, in the pulpit, he stood,\r\ngesturing at the dragon and St. Margaret; here, below him, sat the\r\nquiet-hearted countrymen, wondering in the solemn Sunday sunshine; here,\r\nperhaps, a child, hearing the story for the first time. St. Margaret\r\nmust have been more difficult than the Kings. She begins well enough,\r\nand she goes on well--the village maidens would doubt whether they would\r\nhave the strength to refuse an Olibrius. Then the deliverance from the\r\ndevil would do admirably; the bumpkins would swallow that as easily as\r\nthe devil swallowed St. Margaret. But how to go on? How to explain the\r\nfailure of Providence afterwards? The preacher must have slurred that,\r\nand got on quickly to the wings of the dove.\r\n\r\nTwo great Surrey families belong to Charlwood. One is the line of\r\nSander, or Saunder, settled at Charlwood as early as Edward II, and\r\nstill surviving, in name at all events, in the neighbourhood. It was\r\nRichard Saunder who placed in the church the delicate fifteenth-century\r\noak screen, the most beautiful in the county; but a more famous member\r\nof the family was Nicholas Saunder, Regius Professor and Jesuit Divine,\r\nover whose writings many good churchmen quarrelled. The other family are\r\nthe Jordans of Gatwick, almost as old as the Saunders, and like them\r\nsurviving in cottage life to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Godstone._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nGODSTONE AND BLETCHINGLEY\r\n\r\n    The White Hart at Godstone.--Cobbett's\r\n    violets.--Bletchingley.--Beagles and Foxhounds.--Dr. Nathaniel\r\n    Harris.--Begging the Love of Neighbours.--A gratious woman.--Swift\r\n    and a gentle prelate.--Bletchingley manor.--The Master of the\r\n    Revels.--An English gentleman's Armour.--How to be buried.--Posing\r\n    for a tombstone.--Nutfield.--Fuller's earth and its new uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key to the east of Surrey is Godstone. It is true that the village\r\nitself lies more than two miles from the railway station which bears its\r\nname, but which might equally well have been named Tandridge or\r\nCrowhurst. But there is no other centre in East Surrey from which so\r\nmany other villages and places of interest are easily reached. To the\r\nwest, a mile and a-half away, lies Bletchingley, and another mile\r\nbeyond that, Nutfield, which has not yet been absorbed by Redhill, and,\r\nindeed, belongs to Surrey country as surely as Redhill belongs to the\r\nrailway and the town. To the north are Caterham and Chaldon, and\r\nWoldingham and Warlingham; Tandridge is two miles away, Oxted a little\r\nmore, and Limpsfield not quite four; north of Limpsfield is Titsey, and\r\neast of Limpsfield and Titsey is the Kent border. Crowhurst lies to the\r\nsouth-east, and beyond that Lingfield; but Lingfield is almost Sussex,\r\nand is perhaps a little too far for a walk from Godstone; it is best\r\nreached by rail.\r\n\r\nGodstone begins hospitably, at least to the traveller from the south,\r\nwith three old inns, the Bell, the Rose and Crown, and the old White\r\nHart, now the Clayton Arms. The Bell and the Rose and Crown have not, I\r\nthink, won any particular place in history; probably they were always a\r\nlittle overshadowed by the spacious frontage of the old White Hart. The\r\nRose and Crown, for all that, displays an imposing board setting out the\r\nnumbers and the addresses of the many cycling clubs who have made it\r\ntheir country headquarters--doubtless it has been the first stage of\r\nmany happy, dusty journeys. But the old White Hart has its place in the\r\nclassical country books. Cobbett often lunched there, and probably the\r\ninn-parlour where he had his bread and bacon is very much the same as\r\nwhen he wrote of the village in _Rural Rides_. Perhaps the rooms\r\nupstairs hold more furniture than in the twenties--particularly the fine\r\ndining-room with its oak-beamed ceiling, which is as full of furniture\r\nas a room can very well be, besides serving various public uses as a\r\nplace in which audits and meetings are held and county and local account\r\nbooks inspected. In the yard outside, too, although the great vats of\r\nthe brewhouse are gone, and Renault cars run under the arch which used\r\nto echo with the shoes of spanking teams, there can be little changed\r\nsince Cobbett saw it. He wrote, in 1822:--\r\n\r\n    \"At and near Godstone the gardens are all very neat; and at the Inn,\r\n    there is a nice garden well-stocked with beautiful flowers in the\r\n    season. I here saw, last summer, some double violets as large as\r\n    small pinks, and the lady of the house was kind enough to give me\r\n    some of the roots.\"\r\n\r\nThe garden is still gay and full of flowers; though if I were the\r\nlandlady I should certainly stock some peculiarly pretty sorts of\r\nviolets to keep up the tradition--even if she were to find it a little\r\ndifficult to provide the flowers in bloom in high summer. The village\r\nitself has not grown greatly during the past hundred years. Cobbett\r\ndescribes it as \"a beautiful village, chiefly of one street, with a fine\r\nlarge green before it, and with a pond in the green.\" There is not much\r\nelse to be seen now; the green is as wide and sunny, the geese and\r\nponies graze as contentedly, and the pond is as bright under the\r\nchestnut trees and limes. If there has been any very noticeable change,\r\nit has been made, perhaps, nearer the church and away towards the\r\nrailway station, which lie pretty far apart. From the main road by the\r\nClayton Arms there runs a gravel path up to the church, which stands on\r\nhigher ground, half a mile from the green, and by the path lies a very\r\nfine pond, broad and deep, edged with willows and bulrushes, where wild\r\nduck swim, and on the far side opening into a shallow bay in which you\r\nmay watch plovers bathe through the summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nThe church has not quite the grace and charm of some of its simpler\r\nneighbours; but it is interesting as containing a number of monuments to\r\nthe Evelyns. Church mice are proverbial; but Godstone has a church\r\nrobin, or had one when I was there in the autumn of 1907. Bread had been\r\nplaced conveniently for him in one of the windows, and he flew about\r\nwatching me quietly, and eventually sang a loud solo from beside the\r\norgan--_cantoris_, I think. Outside the church are some of Godstone's\r\nnewer buildings, the almshouses erected by Mrs. Hunt of Wonham House in\r\nmemory of her daughter; like the additions to the church, they are the\r\nwork of Sir Gilbert Scott. Nothing could be more admirable than the\r\nrepose and solidity of these delightful houses, with their massive oak\r\nbeams and sturdy red chimneys. Sir Gilbert himself lived for a time at\r\nRokesnest, between Tandridge and Godstone.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half to the west of Godstone lies Bletchingley, high on the\r\nridge that runs parallel to the downs, above Merstham, to the north.\r\nWhen Mr. Jennings walked into Bletchingley, in his _Field Paths and\r\nGreen Lanes_, the population seemed to him \"at first sight to be made up\r\nof butchers and beagles.\" That was more than thirty years ago, but\r\nBletchingley still keeps up its reputation, in regard to the beagles;\r\nindeed, it has added to its just fame, for the odds are that, in the\r\nsummer months at all events, the first animal to catch your eye in\r\nBletchingley will be a foxhound. The kennels of the Burstow Hunt are at\r\nSmallfields, near Horley, but the puppies introduce themselves to other\r\nlodgings. Another abiding feature of Bletchingley is its cobbled\r\ngutters. The quiet, sunny main street is one of the broadest of all\r\nSurrey village roads, and its gutters drain it admirably. It lies\r\nbetween low and comfortable old houses, of which the White Hart was the\r\nchief, as becomes an ancient and notable inn. The White Hart when I saw\r\nit last was welcoming a couple of foxhounds; another strolled across the\r\nroad careless of a hooting horn; another stood in a shopdoor. But of all\r\nthat belongs to the past in Bletchingley the best lies away from the\r\nmain road. Brewer Street is the name of an offshoot of Bletchingley to\r\nthe north, and contains one of the most perfect small timbered houses in\r\nthe county--the gatehouse of the old manor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Timbered House near Bletchingley._]\r\n\r\nBletchingley has been given a bad character by Cobbett. \"The vile rotten\r\nborough of Bletchingley,\" he calls it, and adds, from a Godstone inn,\r\nthat it is \"happily for Godstone out of sight.\" Long before Cobbett the\r\nBletchingley politicians were in hot water. One of them, Dr. Nathaniel\r\nHarris, was rector of the parish in the early days of the Stuarts, and\r\ntook his politics with him, as other clergymen have done, into the\r\npulpit. A Mr. Lovell was the candidate he wanted in for Bletchingley,\r\nand he did his best for a canvass. He preached a sermon specially\r\ndirected against persons who would not vote for Lovell; he took his text\r\nout of Matthew--\"Now the chief priest and elders sought false\r\nwitnesses\"; and he referred generally to his opponents as lying knaves.\r\nIt must have been inspiriting to hear him. His candidate got in, but\r\nthere was a petition against him for bribery, and Dr. Harris got into\r\ntrouble. He had to kneel at the bar of the House of Commons and humbly\r\nconfess his fault and pray for pardon, and on the next Sunday he had to\r\nconfess again in church, and to beg for the love of his neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Act ended Bletchingley as a borough. It had been bought in\r\nthe reign of Charles II by Sir Robert Clayton, and was just as flagrant\r\na job as Gatton or Haslemere; generally a Clayton sat for it. In the\r\nClayton era there were not many more than a dozen electors, but the\r\nnumbers who turned out at an election were remarkable. The inns set out\r\ntheir barrels in the streets, free to all drinkers; the Bletchingley\r\ncobbles ran beer. As a disfranchised borough, it ended with a flash of\r\ndistinction; its last members were Thomas Hyde Villiers and Lord\r\nPalmerston.\r\n\r\nOther Rectors of Bletchingley were gentler souls than Dr. Harris. One of\r\nthem, William Hampton--he belonged to a remarkable line of Hamptons,\r\nseven generations, and all clergymen--left a pretty passage in his will.\r\nHe bequeathed to his granddaughter, Judith Herat, a plot of ground in\r\nBletchingley, because, as he wrote, \"she is very like her mother and\r\nbeareth the name of her great-grandmother my mother a gratious woman.\"\r\nAnother, Thomas Herring, rose to be Archbishop of Canterbury. Not\r\neverybody would have recommended him. Swift abused him. Herring preached\r\na sermon in Lincoln's Inn and condemned Gay's _Beggar's Opera_, and\r\nSwift went to the attack in the _Intelligencer_. \"I should be very sorry\r\nthat any of the clergy,\" he wrote \"should be so weak as to imitate a\r\nCourt Chaplain who preached against the _Beggar's Opera_, which probably\r\nwill do more good than one thousand sermons of so stupid, so\r\ninjudicious, and so prostitute a divine.\" Swift would have quarrelled\r\nwith his biographer, who gives him an engaging character:--\r\n\r\n    \"His person was majestic; he had a gracefulness in his behaviour and\r\n    gravity in his countenance, that always procured him reverence. His\r\n    pronunciation was so remarkably sweet and his address so insinuating\r\n    that his audience immediately on his beginning to speak were\r\n    prepossessed in his favour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bletchingley._]\r\n\r\nFew manors in Surrey have passed through more distinguished hands than\r\nBletchingley. At the Conquest it was given to the great Richard de\r\nTonebrige, and perhaps he built Bletchingley Castle. He was pretty well\r\noff for land in Surrey, for he held thirty-eight manors in that county\r\nalone. He was the head of the de Clares, and they held Bletchingley for\r\neight generations. The most famous of them was the Red Earl who knew how\r\nto change sides between Simon de Montfort and Henry III so as to be\r\ncursed as a traitor six centuries ago and recognised by later\r\ngenerations as a patriot and a statesman, who could curb the barons as\r\nwell as resist the King. He was the last but one of the de Clares to\r\nhold Bletchingley, and it was during his absence, at the battle of\r\nLewes, that a Royalist party destroyed the Castle. His son died at the\r\nhead of his horse at Bannockburn, and the manor came by marriage into\r\nthe Stafford family. They held it for another six generations, until the\r\nthird Duke of Buckingham, Lord High Constable under Henry VIII, ended\r\nthe splendours of the Staffords on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas Carew had the manor next, and followed Buckingham to Tower\r\nHill. Then Anne of Cleves, too plain for Tower Hill, lived there, and\r\nSir Thomas Cawarden managed it for her and succeeded her. He is the\r\nfascinating figure. He moves in a royal light of Courts and Kings, of\r\nhunting and hawking in the sunshine, and plotting in dark chambers, and\r\nguessing the value of a queen's smile. He was Henry VIII's Master of the\r\nRevels, and Keeper of the King's tents, hales, and toyles (which were\r\nwooden stables and traps for game), and at Bletchingley he entertained\r\nHenry and perhaps more than one of his queens. You picture the Master of\r\nthe Revels riding in velvet by Catherine Howard, and wondering whether\r\nher eyes would take her by the same stairway as Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\nWhen Queen Mary was proclaimed after Edward, and there were risings and\r\nrumours of risings in support of Queen Jane, Sir Thomas Cawarden had his\r\ndifficulties. He had been getting his orders from Jane one day and Mary\r\nthe next, and suddenly there was an end; he was arrested, and all his\r\narms were ordered to be seized. Bletchingley Castle was searched, and\r\nwas found to contain a good deal more than the armour of a few retainers\r\nand the artillery of a deer park. The inventory showed twenty-four\r\ndemi-lances, eighty-six horsemen's staves, one hundred pikes, one\r\nhundred morris-pikes, one hundred bows, two handguns, and other weapons,\r\nbesides sixteen heavy pieces of cannon--enough to arm a hundred horse\r\nand more than three hundred foot. All were seized and taken to the\r\nTower. Sir Thomas complained bitterly. Might not an English gentleman\r\nkeep armour in his country house if he pleased to do so? Mary could\r\nprove nothing against him, and was obliged to let him go. But she\r\nthought his weapons best kept in the Tower; and so, despite his\r\nprotests, did Elizabeth after her. Sir Thomas's petition for their\r\nreturn and for redress is amongst the Loseley manuscripts. Here is part\r\nof his statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"That on xxv. Jan. I. Mary he was lawfully possessed at Bletchingley\r\n    of and in certein horses with furnyture armure artillarie and\r\n    munitions for the warres and divers other goodes to the value of\r\n    L2000 and that upon certein mooste untrue surmises brutes and Rumers\r\n    raised against him was brought into divers and sundry vexations and\r\n    troubles during which time one Sir Thomas Saunders Knight and\r\n    William Saunders of Ewell on pretence of comande did take into their\r\n    heads and possession the said armure and eight of his great horses\r\n    and did convey the same in 17 great waynes thoroughly loaden and at\r\n    the same time spent no small quantity of his corne hay and strawe\r\n    and had only restored 4 loades and of the said 8 great horse oon of\r\n    the best the iii^rd day after died. And the rest are in so evil\r\n    plite and lykyng and were never since otherwise liable to serve in\r\n    the carte to his great hindrance and undoing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Thomas died, his funeral was prodigious. No expense was spared;\r\nthe feasting was Gargantuan; the villagers mourned with the best beef\r\nand beer. Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower, in the _Surrey Archaeological\r\nCollections_, has obtained from the Loseley MS. a full account of the\r\ncharges, from which I make extracts. It is headed:--\r\n\r\n    Suche CHARGES as grew the Daye of the OBSEQUIES of Sir THOMAS\r\n    CAWARDEN, Knight, decessed; viz.--\r\n\r\n    Fyrste to George Melleshe Mchaunt Taylor for black lxxv^li v^s.\r\n    It^m two tonne of beare iii^li.\r\n    It^m iiii quarters wheat iii^li xiiii^s iiii^d.\r\n    Item ii oxen vi^li xiii^s iiii^d.\r\n    Item iiii vealls xiii^s iiii^d.\r\n    Item iiii muttons xvi^s viii^d.\r\n    Item iiii piggs v^s iiii^d.\r\n    Item iiii doz. pyghons viii^s.\r\n    Item vii doz. conyes xvi^s.\r\n    Item iv doz. checkens vi^s viii^d.\r\n    Item sugere spyces and frutes v^li.\r\n    Item wyne v^li.\r\n    Item to one Garrett for helping in the kitchyne too days ii^s.\r\n    Item to Richard Leys for monye borowed of him to be dystributed at\r\n      Horselye when S^r Thom Cawarden dyed for neesorryes iii^li.\r\n    Item for the lone of black cottons xiii^s 1^d ob.\r\n    Item for the waste of other cotten iii^s.\r\n    Item for xxvii yards of black cotten that conveyed the wagon wherein\r\n      the corse was carried to Blechinglie from Horselye xv^s ix^d.\r\n\r\nThe black and the bakemeats and the beer cost altogether L149 16_s._\r\n11_d._ But Sir Thomas had foreseen it all. There were estimates obtained\r\nfor such things in those days. Here is the estimate made by a herald of\r\nthe funeral charges of Sir Thomas's lady:--\r\n\r\n    PREPARATION to be made for the BURYALL of the LADY CARDYN.\r\n\r\n    First the body to be well syred (cered) and chested.\r\n    Item a place to be appointed wher the body shall be buryed.\r\n    Item, ordre to be takin for the hangyng of the churche withe blacke.\r\n    Item, order to be takyn for the raylles wher the morners\r\n      shall knele, to be hangyd with blacke; and also the churche, and the\r\n      said raylles, to be garnyshed with scochins.\r\n    Item, to apoint a gentylman in a blacke gowne to cary the penon of\r\n      armes.\r\n    Item, to apoint v women morners, wherof the chiefest to be in the\r\n      degree of a lady.\r\n    Item, to apoint a knyght or a squier to lede the chieff morner.\r\n    Item, to apoint iiii gentylmen to be assystance to the body.\r\n    Item, yeomen in blacke cottes to carry the body.\r\n    Item, to appoint a preacher.\r\n    Item, to appoint a paulle of blacke velvett to laye upon the body\r\n      during the service.\r\n    Item, prestes and clarks to by appontyd for the said service.\r\n\r\nClarencieulx King of Armes was to manage it, to have five yards of black\r\ncloth for his mourning gown, five shillings a day for his services, L3\r\n6s. 8d. for his fee, and to be paid back \"his chargys to be boryn to and\r\nfro.\" Men knew how to die then, and how to be buried.\r\n\r\nBletchingley manor, after the Cawardens, came to the Howards of\r\nEffingham, and so to an heiress Elizabeth Countess of Peterborough, the\r\nrichest and loveliest lady of her day. Her son fought for the king\r\nagainst his own father, and the House of Commons fined him L10,000 for\r\nturning Roman Catholic. The money had to be found, and the manor was\r\nsold to Sir Robert Clayton, Whig, Lord Mayor, plutocrat, and, according\r\nto Dryden, extortioner. But Dryden's political satire was not always\r\nfair. Ishban, in _Absalom and Achitophel_ is Sir Robert--\r\n\r\n    Ishban, of conscience suited to his trade\r\n    As good a saint as usurer ever made.\r\n\r\nThere was a suspicion that Sir Robert would have liked to purchase a\r\npeerage, and Dryden was furious at the \"shame and scandal,\" though a\r\nquieter spirit, John Evelyn, dined more than once with the Mayor, and\r\nevidently had some admiration for his hospitality. \"He was a discreete\r\nMagistrate\" Evelyn writes, \"and tho' envied, I think without much\r\ncause.\"\r\n\r\nIf Sir Robert Clayton was criticised during his lifetime, he left plenty\r\nof matter for dispute behind him when he died. Half Bletchingley church\r\nis dominated by his monument. Mr. Jennings was appalled by it; \"a\r\nfearful neighbour\" he calls it, and is of opinion that whatever may have\r\nbeen the misdeeds of the dead, \"he never could have done anything bad\r\nenough to deserve his terrific monument.\" As a matter of fact the dead\r\nman designed his own memorial, after the serenely contemplative fashion\r\nof his time. Is the monument, after all so appalling? It cannot but be\r\ninteresting, for it is an index to the taste of a bygone age--an age\r\nwhen the survivors of the dead found relief in Latin superlatives, and\r\nthe living looked into the future with the respectable vanity of an\r\nalderman posing before a mirror. No doubt Sir Robert spent many happy\r\nhours over his monument. Did he, or did the sculptor suggest the plump\r\ncherubs which stand on each side, rolling stony tears from upturned\r\neyes? Did he decide on the particular direction in which he should throw\r\na leg? was it he who selected the disjointed texts which are carved\r\nbelow him? or did the sculptor submit samples? It would be an arresting\r\nspectacle; the finality of the whole thing, the weight of the choosing\r\nwould oppress even a Lord Mayor. A specimen angel would be shown him:\r\nno, he could not approve an angel. Had the sculptor no other sizes in\r\ncherubs? What texts were being used this season? Stone tears.... The\r\nsculptor probably thought of those.\r\n\r\nThe church once had a fine spire. Aubrey mentions it particularly, as\r\nmeasuring \"more than forty feet above the battlements, with five great\r\nbells, the tenour weighing 2000 weight, which were melted with the spire\r\nand all the timber-work destroyed 1606.\" It was computed that in the\r\nspire were 200 loads of timber. In the tower below the timber is still\r\nmagnificent and massive, and there is a new peal of bells, cast in 1780.\r\nBletchingley has one of the longest records of church bell ringing in\r\nthe county. On April 11, 1789, its ringers rang a full peal of 5600\r\nchanges--\"college exercises\"--in three hours thirty-six minutes, as you\r\nmay read in a record in the belfry. In the record the ages of the\r\nringers are carefully given. They range between 19 and 30. Bell ringing\r\nis hard work.\r\n\r\nBetween Bletchingley and Redhill lies Nutfield, which has not yet been\r\ncaught into the town. Perhaps its progress into Redhill will be slow,\r\nfor it stands inconveniently high for wheeled traffic in and out of that\r\nhuddled basin of bricks, and from its own station a mile to the south\r\nthe roads up the hill are some of the steepest in east Surrey. Before\r\nRedhill brings it more money and more bricks, it ought to be worth an\r\nenterprising landlord's while to convert its principal inn to its old\r\nmethods. The Old Queen's Head is a posting inn with the remains of what\r\nwas once a spacious parlour, solid with oak beams big enough for a\r\nbelfry, warmed by a broad open fireplace and offering the hospitality of\r\ntwo great chimney seats. The chimney seats have lapsed into cupboards\r\nand a stove stands where once the wealden logs roared up into the night.\r\nBut if Godstone with its Clayton Arms, or Chiddingfold with its Crown,\r\nbeckons in the passer-by to look at old oak and old walls, why should\r\nnot Nutfield?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nutfield Church._]\r\n\r\nNutfield's chief industry, the digging of fuller's earth, dates back to\r\nbeginnings that are now quite forgotten. The Nutfield pits are still\r\nworking, and spread over the slope on which they lie a dreary stretch of\r\nblue and grey upturned soil as if a giant gamekeeper had been digging\r\nout colossal ferrets. The industry is old enough and important enough\r\nfor the export of fuller's earth to have been prohibited as far back as\r\nEdward II, and in 1693 one Edmund Warren was tried in the Exchequer for\r\nsmuggling a quantity of earth out of the country, though it was proved\r\nto be not fuller's earth but potter's clay. But there is no doubt that\r\ngreat quantities were smuggled abroad, with corresponding injury--or so\r\nit was thought at the time--to the cloth and woollen industry of\r\nGuildford and south-west Surrey. Later days have discovered later\r\nmethods of scouring cloth of grease, and the trade no longer makes large\r\ndemands on the pits of Nutfield. But fuller's earth has still its uses\r\nat the toilet table, and in America other uses. I have ascertained them\r\nexactly. It is employed to dehydrate certain oils with which the\r\npork-packer adulterates lard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lingfield._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nLINGFIELD AND CROWHURST\r\n\r\n    A chapter of Hume.--The Village Cage.--The Copthorne Poachers.--A\r\n    shop for three centuries.--The green-faced Soldan.--A griffin's\r\n    hoof.--Second-best fish.--Eleanor Cobham and the\r\n    Witch.--Crowhurst.--A tree and a rubbish-heap.--An iron\r\n    tombstone.--Fifteen daughters running.--Crowhurst Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nLingfield is not large enough, nor enough overbuilt and railway-ridden,\r\nto dare to the title of capital even of a distant corner of Surrey. But\r\nit stands above and apart from the quiet country round it, like a Bible\r\nin an old library. Near it, or in its streets, are some of the prettiest\r\nand most ancient timber houses in the county; the churchyard with its\r\nbrick paths, its rose-beds, the red walls round it and its view of the\r\nWeald, has the serenity of deep meadowland and sunlit cloisters; the\r\nchurch itself, with its sculptured oak and baronial tombs, belongs to\r\nall English history from Crecy. If the churches of the surrounding\r\nparishes, with their brasses and their registers, make up an admirable\r\nlocal guide-book, the records of Lingfield church are a chapter of Hume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Village Cage, Lingfield._]\r\n\r\nThe village itself is the pleasantest mixture of every style of Surrey\r\ncottage, brick and timber, weather-tiling, plain brick, plain wood, and\r\na queer row of square white-stuccoed buildings which looks as if it had\r\nbeen dumped inland from opposite shingle and dancing seas. It only lacks\r\ntamarisk to be sheer Worthing. The village centres on its pond; not a\r\nbroad nor a very limpid piece of water, but distinguished by a pair of\r\nswans, and by a curious obelisk standing at its head which once may\r\nhave marked a shrine. Built on to the bole of an old oak by the obelisk\r\nis an apartment engagingly labelled \"Ye Village Cage.\" Other Surrey\r\nvillages have had their cages, but only Lingfield has kept one. The door\r\nis massive and threatening, and you get the keys at the chemist's the\r\nother side of the road; or rather, a guide politely accompanies you and\r\ndisplays the cage's secrets. The cage not long ago fell into disuse. It\r\nwas once used as a temporary lock-up for drunk or disorderly persons, or\r\nothers who had traversed the local by-laws of morality. Local justice\r\ndescended upon them, and they were cast into durance until morning\r\nshould bring soberness with a headache, or, in more serious cases, until\r\nproper conveyance could be got round for Godstone. The cage has seen at\r\nleast one exciting rescue. This was some fifty or sixty years ago, when\r\na number of desperate characters vaguely described as the Copthorne\r\npoachers were captured and haled into prison. As to the exact number of\r\ncaptives, tradition varies; but the legend which is the most respectful\r\nto the powers of the local constable sets it at eleven. The eleven were\r\nsurrounded, the door of the dungeon closed on them, and the village\r\ntried to go to sleep. Darkness came on, and a daring deed. Other\r\npoachers stole into the village, got to work with picks and crowbars,\r\ntook the roof off the dungeon and hauled out their comrades exulting.\r\nThe village wisely did not attempt a recapture.\r\n\r\nThe cage saw its last tenant in 1882, and the story of the rescued\r\npoachers may still, perhaps, be heard from the mouth of the oldest\r\ninhabitant, who was himself at one time a constable. As an expert in\r\nsuppressing crime, he never liked the plan on which the cage was built.\r\nThe floor is higher by two steps than the ground outside, and you had to\r\ngo upstairs to it. In fact, you had to throw your prisoner upstairs--a\r\nmost perilous business. It ought to have been built so that you could\r\ntake him by the left leg and throw him downstairs like a Christian.\r\n\r\nCaged prisoners at Lingfield were not always treated with the utmost\r\nrigour of the law. At one time the door was pierced by a grating, and\r\nthrough the grating kindly souls passed packets of tobacco. Liquor could\r\nnot be passed in packets, but found its way in somehow. Afterwards in\r\nseverer days the grating was closed, and prisoners neither drank nor\r\nsmoked, as became their miserable condition. Nine years after the last\r\ncaptive languished behind the blocked grating the prison was taken over\r\nby the village for fresh purposes. Henceforward it was to be the museum,\r\nand was duly vested in trustees. Its collection still grows slowly.\r\n\"Anything to do with village crime--we make that our special subject,\"\r\nthe curator informs you with a pleasing urbaneness. The collection\r\nincludes a man-trap, a pair of handcuffs, a canvas bed which furnishes\r\nthe museum whenever it is wanted as a mortuary, a pair of farmer's\r\nsnowboots used a hundred years ago, and a pair of farmer's ordinary\r\nboots used more recently.\r\n\r\nOf tiny village streets there is no more fascinating byway than the\r\nlittle road which leads up to the south door of Lingfield Church. On the\r\nright is the Star inn, taking its sign from the arms of the great lords\r\nof Sterborough who lie in the church; and built beside the inn a row of\r\nquiet cottages, perhaps once part of the inn. On the left one building\r\nstands out from the rest; an early sixteenth century timber house,\r\nadmirably preserved, and of peculiar interest because after three\r\nhundred years it is still carrying on the business for which it was\r\nintended. It was built as a shop, and it is a shop still. Modern\r\npreference for plate glass and easily opened doors has changed the\r\noriginal plan of the ground floor, but the first floor remains almost as\r\nits builder left it, and its heavy girders with their rounded ends\r\njutting out over the pavement below are a happy testimony to the worth\r\nof wealden builders and wealden wood. Wealden paint, on the other hand,\r\nhas not improved. The girders are still dark and stained as oak (or is\r\nit chestnut?) should be stained by age and weather. But a yard or two\r\naway there are beams as massive and as well-seasoned which flout the\r\nlapse of centuries with a flaring and be-varnished buff.\r\n\r\nThe church is noble and tranquil without and within. A chained Bible\r\nstands on a lectern; another Bible, \"bought May the tenth 1683,\" as the\r\ninscription runs on the title-page, \"by William Saxby of Surry Esq., for\r\nthe use and benefitt of all good Christians\" is in use to-day. But the\r\nchief interest of the church to-day, as it has been its chief glory in\r\nthe past, is its association with the great family of Cobham. The\r\nCobhams of Sterborough--their castle stood two miles east of Lingfield,\r\nbut has fallen--came of a line which through two of the most eventful\r\ncenturies of English history was represented in almost every battle,\r\nconsulted in the most difficult diplomacy, and allied at last by\r\nmarriage to an English king. Their family goes back to a Justice\r\nitinerant who settled in Kent; but the real founder of the Surrey branch\r\nwas the Justice's grandson, the first Lord Cobham of Sterborough. He was\r\none of the greatest soldiers of his day, and, from the ransoms he had\r\nfor the prisoners he took in battle, one of the richest. It was to him,\r\nwith Sir John Chandos and the Earl of Warwick, that Edward III entrusted\r\nthe Black Prince at Crecy; at Poictiers he rescued the King of France;\r\nhe was Lord Admiral of the King's fleet \"from the mouth of the Thames\r\nwestwards\"; and to end it all, he died in his bed of the plague. His\r\neffigy on his tomb tramples a Soldan, whose face has been duly painted\r\ngreen by the artist--an interesting relic, according to Mr. J.G. Waller,\r\nof Crusaders' traditions. There were not enough names for colours in\r\nthose days, and perhaps the soldiers trying to describe the olive skins\r\nof the Arabs, may have called them green. For some obscure reason, too,\r\nthe Soldan with his green face and his red beard is intended by the\r\nartist to be alive. Nobody can say why that should be, but the sculptor\r\ndoubtless knew. He was a careful and accurate man; you can still trace\r\nbelow Lord Cobham's left knee the fastenings of the Garter.\r\n\r\nLord Cobham's wife, Joan, was the author of one of the longest wills in\r\nexistence. She remembered everybody, including the prisoners in chains\r\nat Southwark and the sick men in the hospitals. Her executor Robert\r\nBelknappe was to have \"a horn made from a griffin's hoof with a silver\r\ncore, and the said horn has a silver rim and two silver gilt feet.\" But\r\nshe was most anxious, poor lady, about her soul. \"Before everything\r\nelse\" there were to be said 7000 masses, immediately upon her death, and\r\nthe priests were to have L29 3_s._ 4_d._ for saying them. A penny a\r\nmass, that is, and the priests took the pence. But it was twelve years\r\nbefore they had said the masses.\r\n\r\nThe second Lord Cobham had mingled experiences of love and war.\r\nAccording to the inscription on his tomb, broken in the church but\r\npreserved in the College of Arms, he was \"as brave as a leopard, a\r\nsumptuous entertainer, handsome, imperturbable, and courteous.\" He was a\r\nsoldier, but the great struggle of his life had nothing to do with a\r\nbattlefield. It was his attempt to secure a dispensation from the Pope\r\nfor marrying his cousin in defiance of the canon law. Almost a year\r\npassed before the Pope gave his decision on the point, and then he\r\nordered the unhappy cousins a horribly tedious penance. For four years\r\nthey might not eat meat; they might not drink wine on Wednesdays, and at\r\nthe six fasts they might only eat the second-best kinds of fish, and not\r\nthose which were most agreeable to them. They had to feed four poor\r\npersons daily, and wait upon them themselves; and these poor persons\r\nwere to have bread and meat or fish, with half a flagon of ale, and were\r\nto have new tunics and new russet hoods every year. All this was in\r\naddition to various heavy fines. The money part must have been the least\r\nexasperating: but it might have been amusing to choose the less\r\nagreeable kinds of fish.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of this much be-penanced marriage had two distinctions.\r\nHe was for some years the warden, at Sterborough castle, of the French\r\nheir to the throne, the Duke of Orleans who was taken prisoner at\r\nAgincourt; and he was the founder of Lingfield College. Lingfield\r\nCollege had a provost, six chaplains, four clerks, and thirteen poor\r\npersons, but none of its walls stand to-day. The life of the college\r\nfarm alone survives, in an inventory of the implements and live stock\r\ntaken at the Dissolution.

It was Eleanor, daughter of the founder\r\nof Lingfield College, who married the Lord Protector, the \"good duke\r\nHumphrey\" of Gloucester, and who was convicted of dire misdemeanours.\r\nEdward Hall, the old historian, writing of 1441, tells the story:--\r\n\r\n    \"For first this yere, Dame Elyanour Cobham, wife of the said duke,\r\n    was accused of treason, for that she, by sorcery and enchantment\r\n    entended to destroy the kyng, to thentent to aduance and to promote\r\n    her husbande to the crowne: upon thys she was examined in St.\r\n    Stephen's Chappel before the Bisshop of Canterbury; and there by\r\n    examinacion convict and judged to do open penance, in iij open\r\n    places, within the city of London, and after that adjudged to\r\n    perpetuall prisone in the Isle of Man, under the kepyng of Sir Jhon\r\n    Stanley, Knyght. At the same season were arrested, as ayders and\r\n    counsailers to the sayde duchesse, Thomas Southwel, preiste and\r\n    chanon of St. Stephen's, in Westminster, Jhon Hum, preist, Roger\r\n    Bolyngbroke, a conyng nycromancier, and Margerie Jourdayne, surnamed\r\n    the witche of Eye, to whose charge it was laied y^t thei, at the\r\n    request of the duchesse, had devised an image of waxe, representing\r\n    the kyng, which by their sorcery, a litle and litle consumed,\r\n    entendyng thereby in conclusion to waist, and destroy the kynges\r\n    person, and so to bring him to death; for the which treison they\r\n    wer adjudged to dye, and so Margery Jourdayne was brent in\r\n    Smithfelde, and Roger Bolyngbroke was drawn and quartered at\r\n    Tiborne, takyng upon his death, that there was neuer no such thing\r\n    by theim ymagined; Jhon Hum had his pardon, and Southwel died in the\r\n    toure before execution.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful duchess's penance is in all the history books. But it is\r\nShakespeare, and not the historians, who makes her walk through the town\r\nin a white sheet and barefoot.\r\n\r\nThree miles north of Lingfield is Crowhurst, one of a noble pair of\r\nnames. Crowhurst in Sussex and Crowhurst in Surrey each has its\r\nimmemorial yew, a tree of trees. But the yew of the Surrey\r\nchurchyard--is there no better way of honouring a tree than the\r\nCrowhurst way? Who is to look at a tree like this without unhappiness?\r\nFrom the road the first impression to be had of it is nothing very\r\nimposing; a mass of deep and shining green, of no great stature, with\r\nstrong, springy branches brushing the church walls--that is all. But the\r\nnearer view! You expect, and find, an enormous gnarled trunk, and\r\nthen--Your first idea is that someone has thrown a rubbish-heap at the\r\ntree, and that most of the rubbish has stuck--old tea-trays, broken\r\nkettles, saucepan-lids, the sides of tin trunks. You then perceive that\r\nover gaps and wounds in the vast and writhen shell there have been\r\nbound, or nailed, or otherwise fastened a number of patches of thin\r\nsheet iron, painted a peculiarly ugly red. These patches of paint shriek\r\nwith the names of a thousand cockneys, and the names suit the method of\r\nmending the broken tree. Gus should be the name of the man who fixed\r\nthat patch; Erb, surely, daubed on that paint; Alf, I think, drove in\r\nthat nail. Could none of the foresters of the weald have helped a great\r\ntree better in its old age? There should be methods of preserving a tree\r\nwhich are not of necessity hideous; else, it would be better for the\r\ngiant to die as it pleased.\r\n\r\nThe church stands commandingly on a hill, overlooking level pastures and\r\nwoodlands. But the view to the west, with all its breadth and quiet, is\r\nnot more happy than the nearer picture to the east. Church gates stand\r\nopposite few more charming medleys than the multiplied gables, tumbled\r\ntriangles, and oblongs of red tiles belonging to the roofs of the house\r\non the other side of the road. This fine old brick building, with its\r\nformal garden path and clipped yews is now, like the Gainsfords'\r\nmanor-house a mile away, merely a farmhouse. But it was once the family\r\nresidence of the Angells, the other great family of Crowhurst after the\r\nGainsfords. Like the Gainsfords, the Angell family has disappeared. The\r\nlast John Angell died in 1784, and left a very curious will. His\r\nproperty was to go to anyone who could prove _himself_ (not herself)\r\ndescended from an ancestor of his who lived in the reign of Henry VI.\r\nMany claims followed; none were proved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Crowhurst Church and the old Yew._]\r\n\r\nThe house has one record at least of unrequited hospitality. This is an\r\nextract from the parish registers:--\r\n\r\n    \"1653. July 24.--William Hillyer sonne to ---- Hillyer of Bingfield\r\n    in Barkshire whoe coming as a stranger to M^r. Angell's house in\r\n    Crowhurst dyed: by whom being carefully attended by physiteans and\r\n    others in his sicknes and decently and in good fashion buried, the\r\n    father of the sayd William Hillyer refused to paye one farthing for\r\n    his physitean and buriall like an unnatural father.\"\r\n\r\nInside the church is a strange monument--a slab of Sussex iron, let into\r\nthe floor near the altar, and commemorating Anne Forster, the\r\ngranddaughter of a patriarchal neighbour, Sir John Gainsford. It is odd\r\nin more than one way; it is the only iron tombstone in the county,\r\nthough it is a tombstone that has often been copied. There are still\r\nseveral reproductions of it scattered about the country in the form of\r\nfirebacks; evidently the founders considered the design convenient.\r\nPerhaps they might have made a better job if they had been severer\r\nscholars; for some of the lettering on it is quaint and topsy-turvy, the\r\nS's being twisted the wrong way round and the F's lying unhappily feet\r\nuppermost. Yet it fits well with the other old Gainsford and Angell\r\nmonuments, and is also a memorial of a dead and gone industry, the\r\niron-smelting of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Farmhouse opposite Crowhurst Church._]\r\n\r\nLeisured churchgoers should choose a service at Crowhurst at sunset:\r\nSeptember drives the sun at the right angle to light its dark oak and\r\nthe great beams of the belfry. Many churches have windows built high in\r\nthe west end, through which part of the splendour of the setting sun can\r\nfilter; but this window is set low, and the red sky floods the church.\r\n\r\nFrom the church to Crowhurst Place a mile away runs an interesting\r\nbyway, the only one in Surrey, so far as I know, built by a private\r\ngentleman of permanent material, extending for a mile from his house to\r\nhis place of worship. In the year 1631 the John Gainsford of the day, at\r\nthe fine old age of 76, determined he would walk wet to church no more.\r\nHe had a stone-flagged causeway laid from the manor-house to the\r\nchurchyard, \"it being before,\" as the Parish Register informs you, \"a\r\nloathsom durtie way every stepp.\" He paid two workmen fifty pounds for\r\nthe job, and the causeway is still to be picked out across the meadows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Crowhurst Place._]\r\n\r\nThe Gainsfords were one of the best, though not the greatest of the old\r\nSurrey families. They are first heard of in the reign of Edward III,\r\nwhen John and Margery Gaynesford had the manor of Crowhurst from John de\r\nStangrave and Joan his wife--a delightful gathering of English names.\r\nOne of them, in Tudor days, was Sheriff of Surrey, and well in the Tudor\r\nfashions: he had six wives. But he must have found them disappointing in\r\ntheir family duties, for the first five of them brought him fifteen\r\ndaughters running, and it was only from the sixth and last that he got a\r\nson and heir. He was one of a long succession of Johns and Erasmuses,\r\nbut the line failed at the end. There were never enough boys in the\r\nGainsford families, and when at last the manor went to a daughter the\r\nspell was broken; the house was sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Bridge over the Moat, Crowhurst Place._]\r\n\r\nCrowhurst Place was originally a timber house built in or near the reign\r\nof Henry VII, and according to tradition Henry VIII used to stay there\r\non his way to visit Anne Boleyn at Hever Castle over the border. It was,\r\nand still is in some respects, an admirable example of the masonry and\r\ncarpentry of the fifteenth century, but the destroying hand of later\r\nbuilders has removed part of the timber and filled up the gaps with\r\nbrick and weather-tiling, so that its full character has been taken\r\naway. The great hall, with its glorious beams, was too much for the\r\nutilitarian. The waste of space distressed him. He therefore cut it in\r\ntwo by running a floor across the length of it halfway up, and\r\nsubdivided his floor into bedrooms to accommodate the resident farmer's\r\nnumerous family. It would be difficult to ruin a fine hall more\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nBut the house still has its own beauty, though it is the wild beauty of\r\npoverty and neglect. It stands half a mile from the road to the\r\nsouth-west of the church, approached by a rough bridle path. The first\r\nglimpse through the trees is of gables striped white and dark; a moat,\r\nbefeathered and noisy with ducks, and a little wooden bridge crossing\r\nthe moat to a side-door. Beyond lie great barns, a flagged courtyard and\r\nflagged paths, and round the corner a second bridge over the moat,\r\nbrickbuilt and massive; and by the garden gate a mounting-stone, which\r\nit would be pleasant to think gave Anne Boleyn's royal wooer an easy\r\nstep into the saddle. But it came later, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that Crowhurst Place may be rescued as Tangley Manor\r\nwas? It has the hall, and the kitchen and the oak panelling, and the\r\ngreat fireplaces for which we search all the house-agents' catalogues;\r\nit is moated, it has dined a king; there should be a ghost somewhere.\r\nBut it rests apart, a farmhouse only. Brambles grow about it, such as\r\nshould fence in a castle of sleep; above them timbered gables and tall\r\nchimneys to fit the cold and spacious hearths within. The fires that lit\r\nthose hearths wait their rekindling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nOXTED AND LIMPSFIELD\r\n\r\n    East of Godstone.--Tandridge.--The _Notebook of a Surrey\r\n    Justice_.--Sturdy rogues.--Oxted.--A Rustic Guildford.--Mittens and\r\n    corduroys.--Limpsfield.--Self-criticism.--_The Old Oak\r\n    Chair._--Titsey Park and the Roman villa.--Tatsfield above the\r\n    downs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEast of Godstone five churches stand in a bow stretched to the Kent\r\nboundary. Not each church has a village. Oxted and Limpsfield, in the\r\nmiddle of the bow, are near by a railway station, and Limpsfield plays\r\ngolf on the common: both are little old villages with many new houses\r\nabout them. But Tandridge and Titsey, towards each point of the bow, are\r\nchurches almost without cottages, but with great parks beside them:\r\nTatsfield, easternmost of all Surrey villages, has houses and cottages,\r\nbut the church stands apart, looking out over the Weald.\r\n\r\nTandridge was once Tanrige, and had a priory, which disappeared, of\r\ncourse, at the Dissolution. It was quite a little place; its earliest\r\nrecord, dated somewhere near the end of the twelfth century, describes\r\nit as the Hospital of St. James, in the Ville of Tanregge, with three\r\npriests, in perpetuity there serving God, and Confraters of the said\r\nHospital. So Odo, son of William de Dammartin, writes of it in his deed\r\nof gift of lands, a windmill, and silver cups to make a chalice. The\r\nestablishment was less a priory than a small hospice, in which poor and\r\nneedy persons were cared for, and to which wayfarers might come for\r\nrefuge; one of those gentle places for the help and refreshment of\r\nsorrowing men that are set so strangely before the days of Tudor\r\ncruelties and tortures. The prior's hospice welcomed and comforted the\r\ntired poor; Elizabeth's age beat them, men and women, for sturdy rogues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tandridge Church._]\r\n\r\nLater Tandridge history centres round the church and Tandridge Court.\r\nTandridge Court has had noble owners, but perhaps the most interesting\r\nis Bostock Fuller, who was a Justice of the Peace in the days of\r\nElizabeth, and who has left a notebook describing his work and the cases\r\nthat came before him, which takes his reader extraordinarily close to\r\nTudor times and customs. The manuscript, entitled _Note Book of a Surrey\r\nJustice_, is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and Mr. Granville\r\nLeveson-Gower in the _Surrey Archaeological Collections_, has made\r\nextracts from the Bodleian transcript. Here are some of them:--\r\n\r\n    Apryll 1608.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: 4 Rogues whypped]\r\n\r\n    The 7^th I rode with M^r Evelyn to Sir W. Gaynsfords whoe was sycke,\r\n    to have his testymonye versus George Turner & that day we tooke iiij\r\n    Rogues 2 men and ij women on Blyndlye heath & had them to Godstone\r\n    they had stolen ij duckes and accused eche other of other ffacts, &\r\n    the 8^th daye I went to M^r Evelyns & there we sawe them whipped and\r\n    made them pasports to Devonshire & Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: 2 Rogues whipped]\r\n\r\n    The 15^th daye I caused to stoute Rogues called Marye Rendoll a\r\n    wydow, & Anne Marks a wyfe to be whipped at Tanrydg & sent to\r\n    Rawlyns in Essex.\r\n\r\n\r\n    June 1608\r\n\r\n    The 22th I rode to Kyngston Assyses and there I stayed 23th and 24th\r\n    dayes. Botley and Renfyld whom I sent to the Gaole were there hanged\r\n    and Burges whom M^r Evelyn & I bayled was burnte in the hande.\r\n\r\n\r\n    January 1608\r\n\r\n    John Berrye whom I sent to the goale for stealing Colcocks and\r\n    Whites henns was arrayned & whipt....\r\n\r\n    Bartholomew Gander being accessarye & ... Roaker, were put into the\r\n    Byll with the principal....\r\n\r\n\r\n    1612. 23 Dec.\r\n\r\n    I sent a warrant for Richard Mathewe of Reygate for hunting my lord\r\n    admyralls Conyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1613. The 4^th of June\r\n\r\n    Amias Gullock brought to me by the offycers of Gatton the 4^th daye\r\n    of June for stealing of a petycote which was taken with him; but the\r\n    partie would not accuse him of ffelonye, & he said he boughte it. I\r\n    caused him to be whipte and sent to the place of byrth at Combe by\r\n    Chard in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Julye 19. 1613\r\n\r\n    ... the abouebounden John Lambe is accused by Tho. Dennys for\r\n    shooting in a gunne & vnlawfullie killing of his conyes....\r\n\r\n\r\n    Julye 1616\r\n\r\n    The xi^th I sent Eliz. Edsall seruant to Richard Greene to the house\r\n    of Correction for stryking her dame and threatning her after and for\r\n    departing from her seruice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    19 deg. Nov.\r\n\r\n    ... they broughte ... Toller with a goose which he said he stole\r\n    from Rose Harling, & I charged the Constable to laye him by the\r\n    heeles all night & to bring him again next morning.\r\n\r\n    He brake the stocks and ran away.\r\n\r\nSo went village life for Tandridge in the golden days. Few cottages have\r\nbeen added since Mr. Bostock Fuller used to ride to the assizes. He\r\nwould see little change, perhaps, in the church, with the glorious oak\r\nbeams that bear up its belfry, and little, too, in the mighty yew whose\r\nbranches brush its tower. Over one gravestone he might be puzzled. It\r\nhas been placed in the grass, I think since his day, near the south\r\ndoor, and is an ancient monument of hard sandstone with a cross carved\r\non it. Legend says that it was brought from Tandridge Priory, but there\r\nare others like it at Oxted and Titsey which belong to an older date\r\nthan the priory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Street in Oxted._]\r\n\r\nOxted is north-east of Tandridge; but there are two Oxteds. One is the\r\nnew village near the station, with new shops, a new inn, and the old\r\nchurch. The other is the old village, set apart from the railway; a\r\nlittle village clustered about a main street running up the hillside--a\r\nrustic Guildford, a main street with cottage fronts for Guildford house\r\nfronts, and an ancient timbered inn hanging out a golden bell instead of\r\nGuildford's clock. Guildford's houses should hold Kate Greenaway maidens\r\nand prim ladies with mittens: Oxted should have corduroys and aprons,\r\nbrown children and sunbonnets. So Oxted has; and it has also, I think,\r\nmore little inns than any Surrey village near its size. Each has its\r\nsign; the street holds out a gallery of signs: stone steps and raised\r\nalleys run to the cottage doorways, and the children play curious\r\nvillage games with chalk squares and knucklebones, safe in the doorways\r\nand on the pavement. There is a corner by the road crossing the main\r\nstreet which is the prettiest in east Surrey. Weatherbeaten,\r\nbrick-and-timber cottages frame it: the Bell Inn, with its beams like\r\nletters of a big black alphabet, hangs out its gold bell; beyond, the\r\nroad slopes to dim country greennesses and the hill of the downs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oxted Church._]\r\n\r\nOxted church tower is noble and massive; a great content is about its\r\nquiet, solid battlements. Once it had a spire, and I wish I had never\r\nread that the spire was destroyed; now when I see it I am always\r\nwondering what the church was like with a spire. In the churchyard are\r\ntwo ancient tombstones, like the single stone at Tandridge; they, too,\r\nare far older than the church.\r\n\r\nOther strange monuments are in the church. One is to the memory of Ann,\r\nwife of Charles Hoskins, who thus mourned her in 1651:--\r\n\r\n        LET THIS\r\n    PATTERNE OF PIETY\r\n      MAPP OF MISERY\r\n    MIRROUR OF PATIENCE\r\n        HERE REST\r\n\r\nIn another memorial you may trace the history of an extremely large\r\nfamily. John Aldersey \"haberdas^hr and m'chant ventoror of London\" died\r\nin 1616, aged seventy-five, \"and had ysue 17 childeren.\" The whole\r\nseventeen are represented in marble accompanying, and from their dress\r\nand different sizes you may guess what happened to them. There are ten\r\nsons and seven daughters; of the ten sons, six are bearded men, who grew\r\nup, perhaps, and were men like their father: three are younger, just\r\nordinary sons, and one is a baby--I suppose died as a baby. Of the seven\r\ndaughters, two are babies, and the five that wear caps you may imagine\r\nto be girls who grew up and were married and lived happily.\r\n\r\nIn Barrow Green House, an admirable building, perhaps more Georgian than\r\nJacobean, once lived Grote, the historian. He lies in Westminster Abbey;\r\nhis widow, as we saw, is buried in Shere churchyard. Barrow Green Farm,\r\nclose by, is all that an old farmhouse should be, complete with barns,\r\nan oasthouse, and a fascinating front to the road. Oasthouses begin\r\nhere, near the Kent border. Surrey grows few hops; only at Farnham and\r\nnear Oxted, I think. In the west Hampshire encourages her, and here she\r\ntakes heart from Kent.\r\n\r\nLimpsfield is the other side of the railway. The centre is unlike old\r\nOxted, for it is the church; but you cannot get a picture of Limpsfield\r\nas separate and self-contained as of old Oxted. Oxted sets itself on its\r\nhillside more charmingly than any village of the Surrey weald; you get\r\nthe picture from halfway up the road to the station, and you should look\r\nat it when the sun is setting. Then the white ricks in the foreground\r\nloom larger, and the huddled roofs and gables age into another century;\r\nthe blue smoke of wood fires drifts in the wind across the hill. But you\r\ncannot hold Limpsfield at such a pleasant distance; you must come into\r\nthe village street close to the old cottages, and close too, to a large\r\nhouse with a noble frontage on the roadway; great houses are seldom set\r\nso near to cottages and the road. But Limpsfield, with all its\r\nattractive antiquities of timber and gables, somehow strikes a modern\r\nnote. Detilens is the name--a name one vaguely tries to scan for a Latin\r\nverse--of a little, hidden house of great age, in the village street.\r\nBut it is the common, not Detilens or neighbouring roofs, which marks\r\nLimpsfield, and on the common are golf links and the huge red-brick\r\nbuildings of a school.\r\n\r\nA century ago Limpsfield held an author and a critic. He was the author\r\nof a tiny book, _Lympsfield and its Environs_, which was republished in\r\n1838 with an introduction by a friend, who signs himself \"H.G.\" and\r\ndates his preface from Westerham. At Westerham, too, the curious little\r\nrepublication was issued. It is illustrated by George Cruikshank and\r\nwith pleasant prints of old pencilled drawings, and besides a poem,\r\ncontains a number of descriptions of the chief houses of the\r\nneighbourhood. Here is one of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"CHART'S EDGE.\r\n\r\n    On inquiring of a native, we were told that this place was the\r\n    residence of \"Mr. _Antiquary Streatfeild_.\" We doubt, however, if he\r\n    has any just pretensions to that designation, a divine across the\r\n    border assuring us that he is skilled in glamoury, and illustrating\r\n    his account by stating that 'where there was a hill, there he would\r\n    have a hollow, where there was a dell, there we should find a\r\n    mound'; and, indeed, we ourselves experienced the delusion, for the\r\n    spot which we had known for many years as a bleak desert, appeared\r\n    sheltered and decorated with thriving plantations, a house new from\r\n    the kiln, cheated us with its Elizabethan air; neither was the spell\r\n    broken when we found ourselves in the interior; there we saw, or\r\n    thought we saw, one of Raphael's loveliest easel pictures, one of\r\n    Rembrandt's deep toned yet brilliant interiors, and a goodly row of\r\n    ancestors in flowing wigs and ample ruffles; whilst, in fact, the\r\n    former were no more than a foxy Italian copy of the divine Urbino,\r\n    and a modern English attempt to mimic the glorious Fleming, and the\r\n    latter, Cockneys and Kentish Yeomen.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a concatenation of studied insults might be supposed to have\r\nfinished with a libel action. But it is the only description of a\r\nneighbouring house which has a hint of raillery, and a pencilled note in\r\na copy I found of the little old book adds the explanation. Chart's Edge\r\nbelonged to the author of _Lympsfield and its Environs_. I imagine,\r\nalso, that Mr. Antiquary Streatfeild was the author of _The Old Oak\r\nChair_, republished in the same volume by his friend \"H.G.,\" and\r\ndescribed as a ballad \"sung at an anniversary dinner of the Westerham\r\nAmicable Benefit Society, to which the author has proved a steady\r\nfriend.\" This is the ballad of _The Old Oak Chair_:--\r\n\r\n    My good sire sat in his old oak chair,\r\n        And the pillow was under his head,\r\n    And he raised his feeble voice, and ne'er\r\n          Will the memory part\r\n          From my living heart\r\n        Of the last few words he said.\r\n\r\n    \"When I sit no more in this old oak chair,\r\n        And the green grass has grown on my grave,\r\n    And like armed men, come want and care,\r\n          Know, my boys, that God's curse\r\n          Will not make matters worse,\r\n        How little soever you have.\r\n\r\n    \"The son that would sit in my old oak chair,\r\n        And set foot on his father's spade,\r\n    Must be of his father's spirit heir,\r\n          And know that God's blessing\r\n          Is still the best dressing,\r\n        Whatever improvements are made.\"\r\n\r\n    And he sat no more in his old oak chair;\r\n        And a scape-thrift laid his hand\r\n    On his father's plough, and he cursed the air,\r\n          And he cursed the soil,\r\n          For he lost his toil,\r\n        But the fault was not in the land.\r\n\r\n    And another set in his father's chair,\r\n        And talked, o'er his liquor, of laws,\r\n    Of the tyranny here and the knavery there,\r\n          'Till the old bit of oak\r\n          And the drunkard broke,\r\n        But the times were not the cause.\r\n\r\n    But I have redeemed the old ricketty chair,\r\n        And trod in my father's ways;\r\n    Have turned the furrow with humble prayer\r\n          To profit my neighbours,\r\n          And prosper my labours;\r\n        And find my sheaves with praise.\r\n\r\nCruikshank draws the scape-thrift roystering over punch and\r\nchurchwardens' pipes. The careful and thrifty farmer is in another\r\npicture. He has no pipe, and he talks kindly to his wife, and dandles\r\nhis son on his knee. There is a large ale-jug on the table, and he has\r\nhad a capital dinner.\r\n\r\nTitsey, a mile and a half away under the downs, is not a village at all;\r\njust a modern church outside Titsey Park, and a cottage opposite the\r\nchurch which was once an inn, and could swing a sign now if it wished;\r\nthe frame is there. Once the church stood inside the park. That was when\r\nTitsey Place belonged to the Greshams, the ancestors of its later\r\nowners, the Leveson-Gowers. Sir John Gresham, looking one day in 1776 at\r\nthe old church, decided that it was too near his house: it was only\r\nthirty-five feet distant. With the insolence of the day, he knocked it\r\ndown, and the modern church stands obediently outside the gates. But\r\nTitsey Park has made amends. When the late Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower\r\nwas at Titsey he brought to light, and described in the _Surrey\r\nArchaeological Collections_, the foundations of a Roman villa discovered\r\nin the Park, almost touching the old road used by the pilgrims on their\r\nway to Canterbury. The foundations were interestingly complete, and from\r\nthe ground near were dug coins, pottery, and a bronze mask. To-day the\r\nvilla may be visited, but it is overgrown by weeds and elder bushes, and\r\nthe visible remains are of scanty walls and tumbled pillars; rabbits, I\r\nthink, see most of it.\r\n\r\nFrom Titsey you may climb a steep road and find Tatsfield church,\r\nseparated from its scattered village, clean on the edge of the steep\r\nhill. Tatsfield church, which is old and small, stands nearly eight\r\nhundred feet above the weald, and its little churchyard, with a path in\r\nit leading to no gate, but only to a hedge, lends a curious sense of a\r\ngarden. The stretch of Sussex and Kent to the south is freer and wider\r\nthan any other Surrey church sees; but Tatsfield, like other places with\r\na fine view, suffers continual loss in cloudy weather. When I was last\r\nthere the church stood alone on the brow, over unguessable depths of\r\ngrey mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nDULWICH TO WIMBLEDON\r\n\r\n    Growing London.--Cigars by Dulwich Valley.--Edward Allen, Actor,\r\n    Bear-baiter, Dog-fancier and Founder of a College.--Godd's\r\n    Guift.--Dulwich buttercups.--Dr. Johnson.--A Prayer in a\r\n    Library.--Merton.--Wimbledon Camp.--A Miser's grave.--An opportunity\r\n    for a duel.--Groans for George Ranger.--Memories of the Windmill.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is more capricious than a vast town pushing out into the\r\ncountry. No law binds it; no power can resist it; it will not be\r\ntempted, or denied; only one future can certainly be prophesied for it,\r\nthat where it comes it will remain. Looking at London and its\r\nsurroundings on a new map and an old, it is an arresting thing to\r\ntrace--almost to watch--the growth of the inexorable black ink on what a\r\ndecade or two before was inviolate white. There is nothing orderly about\r\nit, nothing mathematical. London does not grow as the circles spread\r\nfrom a splash in a pond, nor regularly and certainly as geologists say\r\nstones grow in the soil--a fascinating and rather dreadful secret of\r\ngrowth. London grows suddenly by fits and starts. Once, perhaps, the\r\ntown crept out quietly, a field at a time, a new road in a twelvemonth.\r\nNow it catches great parks and manors. But which way it will go out to\r\ncatch them you cannot guess. It may walk threateningly, and it may leave\r\nalone, as it has left the deepest of hayfields alone in Kent much nearer\r\nLondon than in Surrey. One rule, perhaps, it keeps relentlessly; it will\r\nnever leave country between London old and London new. The Londons join\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nRuskin, in _Praeterita_, shows you London striding by Herne Hill to\r\nCroydon. Herne Hill should be a hill with a heronry on it, but the name\r\nis new; it was King's Hill when John Speed made his map in the days of\r\nJames I. But Herne Hill was in the country when Ruskin knew it. Norwood\r\nwas a hill; Dulwich was a valley. \"Central in each amphitheatre, the\r\ncrowning glory of Herne Hill was accordingly, that, after walking along\r\nits ridge southward from London through a mile of chestnut, lilac, and\r\napple trees, hanging over the wooden palings on each side--suddenly the\r\ntrees stopped on the left, and out one came on the top of the field\r\nsloping down to the south into Dulwich valley--open field animate with\r\ncow and buttercup, and below, the beautiful meadows and high avenues of\r\nDulwich; and beyond, all that crescent of the Norwood hills; a footpath,\r\nentered by a turnstile, going down to the left, always so warm that\r\ninvalids could be sheltered there in March, when to walk elsewhere would\r\nhave been death to them; and so quiet, that whenever I had anything\r\ndifficult to compose or think of, I used to do it rather there than in\r\nour own garden. The great field was separated from the path and road\r\nonly by light wooden open palings, four feet high, needful to keep the\r\ncows in. Since I last composed, or meditated there, various improvements\r\nhave taken place; first the neighbourhood wanted a new church, and built\r\na meagre Gothic one with a useless spire, for the fashion of the thing,\r\nat the side of the field; then they built a parsonage behind it, the two\r\nstopping half the view in that direction. Then the Crystal Palace came,\r\nfor ever spoiling the view through all its compass, and bringing every\r\nshow-day from London a flood of pedestrians down the footpath who left\r\nit filthy with cigar ashes for the rest of the week: then the railroads\r\ncame, and expatiating roughs by every excursion train, who knocked the\r\npalings about, roared at the cows, and tore down what branches of\r\nblossom they could reach over the palings on the enclosed side. Then the\r\nresidents on the enclosed side built a brick wall to defend themselves.\r\nThen the path got to be insufferably hot as well as dirty; and was\r\ngradually abandoned to the roughs, with a policeman on watch at the\r\nbottom. Finally, this year, a six foot high close paling has been put\r\ndown the other side of it, and the processional excursionist has the\r\nliberty of obtaining what notion of the country air and prospect he may,\r\nbetween the wall and that, with one bad cigar before him, another behind\r\nhim, and another in his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nDulwich valley, and cows and buttercups--it has still an uneasy echo of\r\nthe town. Somewhere, surely, there always broods over Dulwich the spirit\r\nof the founder of its college. He is the Londoner of Londoners, and the\r\noddest combination of characters that ever left a name as pious\r\nbenefactor of a school. Edward Allen, or Alleyn as his college spells\r\nhim, was to begin with an Elizabethan actor. He was one of a company of\r\nstrolling players before he was twenty; he was twenty-two when he had\r\nsomehow made himself a \"gentleman,\" to be so described on a deed of\r\ngift; and when he was twenty-six, he was such an actor that Ben Jonson\r\ncompared him to Roscius and Cicero, and Thomas Nash wrote that \"Not\r\nRoscius or Aesope, those tragedians admired before Christ was borne,\r\ncould ever performe more in action than famous Ned Allen.\" Perhaps he\r\nmade his money as an actor-manager; perhaps he married money, for his\r\nwife was the daughter of a pawnbroker (who was also a theatre-proprietor\r\nand one of the grooms of the Queen's chamber); perhaps he began lending\r\nmoney early in life himself. He and his father-in-law, when James\r\nsucceeded Elizabeth, were made chief masters of \"his Majesty's games of\r\nBeares, Bulls and doggs\"; they had a menagerie in the Paris Gardens at\r\nSouthwark where they kept wolves and lions; they worried bulls and had\r\ndog-fights, and showed \"pleasant sport with the horse and ape and\r\nwhipping of the blind beare.\" Money rolled in, with the apes and the\r\nbears and the loans, and in October, 1605, Allen, by this time full\r\nesquire, bought the manor and lands of Dulwich for L4,900. Eight years\r\nlater he left Southwark for Dulwich, and set about founding his college.\r\n\r\nAubrey has a quaint legend of the foundation. How should an actor found\r\na college? The devil was in it somewhere. Tradition told \"that Mr.\r\n_Alleyne_, being a Tragedian, and one of the Original Actors in many of\r\nthe celebrated _Shakespear's_ Plays, in one of which he play'd a Daemon,\r\nwith six others, and was in the midst of the Play surpriz'd by an\r\n_Apparition_ of the _Devil_, which so worked on his Fancy, that he made\r\na Vow which he perform'd at this Place.\" That was the beginning of\r\nDulwich College, according to one story; according to another, it was\r\nonly because Allen had begun so earnestly, and tied himself up by so\r\nmany legal contracts that he did not repent of his vow and take back all\r\nhe had given. That was when, a widower of fifty-seven, he wanted to\r\nmarry a girl of twenty. She was John Donne's daughter Constance, and\r\nperhaps Donne felt bound to ask for liberal settlements. However, the\r\nsettlements were arranged somehow, and the college was founded. The\r\n\"colledge of God's gift\" was his name for it, and as its founder he\r\ndescribed himself as \"chief master, ruler and overseer of all and\r\nsingular over games of beares, bulls, mastive doggs and mastive\r\nbitches.\" His blood-relations were to be Master and Warden, if possible,\r\nand so, for many years, they were.\r\n\r\nOne of the statutes explains the name \"God's gift.\" There were to be\r\ntwelve poor scholars, chosen partly by merit and partly by chance. When\r\na place became vacant three or four children were to be elected by the\r\nparish vestries, and of these two were to be chosen by the Master and\r\nWarden, and then the two were to draw lots:--\r\n\r\n    \"The manner of drawinge of the said lot shall be thus: Two equal\r\n    small rowleses of paper to be indifferently made and rolled up, in\r\n    one of which rolls the wordes 'Godd's Guift' are to be written, and\r\n    the other rowle is to be left blank and so put into a boxe; which\r\n    boxe shalbe thrice shaken up and downe, and the elder person of\r\n    those two that are elected to drawe the first lot, and the younger\r\n    person the second; and whiche of them draweth the lott wherein the\r\n    wordes 'God's Guift' are written shalbe forthwith admitted.\"\r\n\r\nAnother gift followed Allen's. When Sir Francis Bourgeois died early in\r\nthe last century he left his fine collection of pictures to the school.\r\nThe gallery is open to the public; but a description, in the space I\r\nhave here, could be no more than a list of names.\r\n\r\nDulwich still has some of its fields and buttercups; the playing fields\r\nare a pleasant oasis which is the last vision of sunlight and grass for\r\nthe traveller on the Chatham and Dover railway before plunging into the\r\nmurk of the Penge tunnel. Of its neighbours to the west, Streatham\r\nclusters about a tangle of railways; Streatham, which was deep country\r\nfor Dr. Johnson, knocked down, in 1863, the house and cut up the park\r\nthat Dr. Johnson knew when they belonged to the Thrales. He would not\r\nrecognise the church--the church to which he bade farewell with a\r\nkiss--it has been rebuilt. The library, which, if it were standing\r\nto-day with the books that Johnson read, would be the most sought for\r\nroom in Surrey, went, of course, with the house. Eighty years before it\r\nfell Johnson had parted from it with a prayer. \"Help me,\" he prayed,\r\n\"that I may, with humble and sincere thankfulness, remember the comforts\r\nand conveniences which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I may\r\nresign them with holy submission, equally trusting in Thy protection\r\nwhen Thou givest, and when Thou takest away.\" That was the library which\r\nwas destroyed only forty-five years ago. But Streatham, when it knocked\r\ndown the Thrales' house, had very good authority for parting with all it\r\nhad of Dr. Johnson. Mrs. Thrale would not have minded. She sold all the\r\nletters Dr. Johnson wrote her for a matter of five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nBetween Streatham and Wimbledon London strides out in patches. It has\r\nnot yet taken in Mitcham, which has a fine green with memories of great\r\nSurrey cricket, and which grows all manner of scented flowers, lavender\r\nand mint and rosemary and everything old-fashioned for herbalists and\r\nperfumers and ladies' sachets and linen-chests. But Merton, north-west\r\ntowards Wimbledon, has been caught fast. Merton church, in which Nelson\r\nused to worship, and which has his hatchment on the wall, above fine\r\ncross beams of oak, stands among brand-new roofs and roads. Opposite the\r\nchurch is the forlornest thing; a house which once was Sheridan's, and\r\nwhich is now the warehouse of a shop, and hangs in its hall and rooms\r\nprinted calico. The windows are broken and cobwebby, the garden is a\r\nruin, but the calico, which you may buy at a shop in the town, is fresh\r\nand very brightly printed. Francis Nixon, the founder of Merton's\r\ncalico-printing, which is quite an industry, lies in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nAnd so, by a ring from east to west, where London joins the Surrey\r\ncountryside, we come to Wimbledon; Wimbledon old and new, as old as a\r\ncamp which may have been Saxon, as young as yesterday's new villa. The\r\ncamp, it is true, exists no longer. It has had more learned essays\r\nwritten over it than any in Surrey; it has been claimed as belonging to\r\nCassivelaunus, it has been argued to be a Roman camp, and it has been\r\nurged that it marks the site of a battle between Saxon and Saxon for the\r\npossession of Surrey. It was a war camp, pretty certainly, from its\r\nshape, which was almost exactly circular. But you can see the shape no\r\nlonger. Wimbledon was unfortunate enough to see its famous camp fall\r\ninto the hands of a Mr. Sawbridge Erle Drax, and he, in 1875, dared to\r\nlevel its dykes with the ground, to cut down its mound, and fill in its\r\nditch. Of acts of wanton and insolent destruction, this stands supreme\r\nin the history of the county.\r\n\r\nWimbledon has held a great house, and has seen royal progresses which\r\ncost the lord of the manor a fortune. Thomas Cromwell was one of the\r\nlords of the manor, and after him came Catherine Parr: but the great\r\ndays were those of the Cecils. Lord Burghley, Elizabeth's treasurer,\r\nlived at intervals at the Rectory House, and some of Elizabeth's summer\r\nexcursions came to Wimbledon; she stayed with her treasurer and with his\r\nson. But the Cecil who belongs most to Wimbledon is not the treasurer\r\nwhose nod summed up the wisdom of a Parliament, nor any Lord of\r\nBurghley; but a younger son who was a soldier and a sailor. He was\r\nAdmiral and Marshal-General of the forces sent by James I. and Charles\r\nI. against the Spaniards; he was made Lord Wimbledon, and his memory on\r\nthe records of the army of his day is that his name of Cecil was punned\r\ninto General Sit-still when he was a soldier of almost foolhardy\r\npersonal daring, and that he re-introduced into the army the \"old\r\nEnglish march.\" There was \"one certaine measure,\" a royal warrant\r\ninforms us, which had been lost \"through the negligence and carelessness\r\nof drummers,\" although it had been \"by the approbation of strangers\r\nthemselves, confessed and acknowledged the best of marches.\" This march,\r\nat the instance of Lord Wimbledon, was beaten in the king's presence at\r\nGreenwich in 1610 and ordered to be exactly and precisely observed by\r\nall drummers in the kingdom of England and principality of Wales,\r\nwithout any addition or alteration whatsoever. We do not hear it in\r\nthese days of battles without drums and colours; but we do not fight\r\nmuch better, perhaps, without the drums.\r\n\r\nThe old Wimbledon church was demolished; the new church was built in\r\n1786. It has many monuments, but the grave which fascinates is the tomb\r\nneither of a great statesman nor a good man. It is apart in a far\r\ncorner; over it is laid a huge slab of black stone, perhaps half a foot\r\nthick, and the stone tells you that under it lies the body of \"John\r\nHopkins, Esquire, familiarly known as Vulture Hopkins.\" Misers have had\r\nhard things said of them often enough; of Hopkins Pope wrote that \"he\r\nlived worthless, but died worth three hundred thousand pounds,\" and,\r\nreflecting on the \"Use of Riches,\" Pope made a couplet on his funeral:--\r\n\r\n    \"When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend\r\n    The wretch who living saved a candle's end.\"\r\n\r\nBut those legends belong to paper and books. They are less easily\r\ndestroyed than an epithet engraved on a stone; but who of deliberation\r\nwould carve an insult, as this is carved, for a dead man?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Golf House and Windmill, Wimbledon Common._]\r\n\r\nWimbledon will never belong to the town so long as it keeps its common.\r\nIt is the wildest thing near London. It is almost as wild and lonely a\r\nplace to-day as when in Georgian and early Victorian days statesmen and\r\nnoblemen chose it as a fashionable and convenient ground for duelling.\r\nThe common has seen more than one historic duel. The Duke of York and\r\nColonel Lennox met there in 1789; the Duke received the Colonel's fire,\r\nand the ball grazed his hair, but he did not fire in return. Pitt\r\nfought a duel with a member of Parliament on Putney Heath north of the\r\ncommon in 1798; each fired twice at twelve paces and hit nothing. Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett and Mr. John Paull fought in 1807, wounded each other\r\nand went back together to London in the same carriage. Canning and\r\nCastlereagh fought in 1809, and Grattan, two years after Queen Victoria\r\ncame to the throne, received Lord Londonderry's fire and himself fired\r\nin the air. Another Grattan could meet another Irish peer to-day, and if\r\nthey chose their places well, nobody would hear a pistol at all. The\r\nbracken and the heather slope into dells and valleys which would shelter\r\nthree duels in a morning; you could deliver a salvo and hardly scare a\r\nnursery maid.\r\n\r\nBut Wimbledon's longest acquaintance with firearms was in the days\r\nbefore the National Rifle Association moved to Bisley. Queen Victoria\r\nfired the first shot on July 2nd, 1860, when she pulled a scarlet cord\r\nand scored a bull's-eye with a Whitworth rifle; a red and white flag was\r\nshown in an instant, you read, and \"three points were scored to the\r\nQueen of England.\" The last shot was fired in 1889. I went to that\r\nmeeting as a schoolboy, and am even now filled with an awe that belongs\r\nto spacious days, remembering that we were told that on the last evening\r\nthe whole camp was to give three great groans for \"George Ranger,\" the\r\nDuke of Cambridge, whose duty it had been to declare the common unfitted\r\nfor the distant probings of misdirected Martini-Henry bullets. Those\r\nconcerted, resentful, thousand-throated groans seemed a tremendous\r\nnightly business; there were camp-fires, one imagined, from which the\r\ncircular groan would ascend, a rumble which should expel a ministry,\r\nunseat a prince. Not very much came of the groaning, I suppose;\r\ncertainly the Volunteers liked the Bisley ranges, next year, much\r\nbetter. But the old windmill, which looked on in its time at thirty full\r\nmeetings, still surely misses the week when the dells and the long\r\nstretches of heather rattled from the first gun to sunset with the\r\ncrackle of Martinis and match rifles. The windmill watches red-coated\r\ngolfers to-day, playing to some of the prettiest greens in the south of\r\nEngland; but the days for the windmill were when the tents were white\r\nabout the heather, and when they sold Stewart's Verniers where to-day a\r\nmore leisured generation misses short putts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE SURREY SIDE\r\n\r\n    Mortlake.--The Boat Race.--A duel.--Putney-by-the-sea.--Punch and\r\n    Judy.--Kennington.--Gallows and faggots.--The proper way to\r\n    subscribe to a Cricket Club.--Camberwell Beauties.--The Tradescants\r\n    and their Dodo.--Mr. Jeffery Saffery.--The old Surrey Side.--The\r\n    Tabard.--The Old Road.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Surrey side begins, perhaps, if it begins anywhere definitely, at\r\nMortlake, where the Boat-race ends. By Kew and Richmond the Thames runs\r\nfor pleasure-boats, gigs and skiffs with shining oars. Below Mortlake\r\nthe river hears the forge and the dockyard; torpedo-boats drive out into\r\nthe tide; it is different water, London water, under their bows. The\r\nfour miles of the Thames of the Boat-race mark the gradual change. On a\r\nrough day the two eights ride through waves which are less like a river\r\nthan a sea; and perhaps the rough water has made some of the best\r\nhistory of the race. When Cambridge sank in 1859 she was waterlogged\r\nearly in the race; she could not have won, but the steamers following\r\nthe eights prevented her even from passing the winning-post, by swamping\r\nher with their wash. Oxford won, but Cambridge's was an equal honour.\r\nThe crew rowed on as the boat went under the water; and the name that\r\nwill always belong to that race is that of a future Lord Justice, Mr.\r\nA.L. Smith. Cambridge and Mr. A.L. Smith went on rowing in the water,\r\nknowing that Mr. Smith could not swim. On another rough day, thirty-nine\r\nyears later, the race was lost and won by the toss; the Cambridge boat\r\nfilled at the start, and Oxford rowed in out of the wind. Other historic\r\nraces belong to the curve of the river above Barnes Bridge; three in\r\nparticular, in 1886, 1896, and 1901, when the crew that was behind at\r\nBarnes Bridge passed the other crew at the bend of the river and won.\r\nOf other historic races, perhaps the wins of the two crews in which a\r\nGoldie turned the fortunes of his University will always possess\r\npeculiar glories. The first Goldie, in 1870, ended a series of nine\r\nOxford wins. Another Goldie, in 1899, helped Cambridge to end another\r\nseries, also of nine. The name and the two nines in the date surely made\r\nthe feat inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe river water does not change, but the banks have altered from grass\r\nand reeds to concrete and stone. It was a mile or so from Barnes Bridge,\r\nin a field near Barn Elms (but who could guess where?) that the second\r\nDuke of Buckingham fought and shot Lord Shrewsbury. The Duke left behind\r\nhim one of the wickedest lives of the most dissolute Courts of English\r\nhistory; but he left nothing viler than the name of Lord Shrewsbury's\r\nCountess, who rode in boy's clothes as a page to the duelling ground,\r\nand then held her seducer's horse while he shot her husband. They left\r\nhim dying and rode back together. That was in 1667; an earlier and a\r\nkindlier association of Barn Elms is a resident who afterwards died at\r\nChertsey, Abraham Cowley; later came Jacob Tonson, bibliophile and\r\npublisher of Pope and Dryden. And it was at Barn Elms, too, that the\r\nKit-Kat Club, the thirty who dined at Christopher Kat's in the Strand,\r\nand bound themselves to uphold the Protestant succession, met and dined\r\nand looked at their portraits painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller. The\r\nKit-Kat portraits are now at Bayfordbury, near Hertford, and for the\r\nlast fifteen years Barn Elms has housed, not publishers or painters, but\r\npolo players. The Ranelagh Club was born to help Hurlingham over the\r\nwater provide grounds for the youngest of the great games naturalised in\r\nEngland. Nine years later Barnes welcomed another club, Roehampton,\r\nwhich added three more grounds to the four of Hurlingham and Ranelagh.\r\n\r\nThe Boat-race finishes at Mortlake; it starts at Putney, and Putney is\r\nthe headquarters and the rendezvous of many clubs and rowing men. The\r\nSurrey bank from Putney Bridge up stream is a string of club houses,\r\nboat houses, and little wooden buildings that do duty for both, and\r\nhere, on sloping banks sometimes washed by brimming tides, sometimes\r\nbroad and flat by a shrunken stream on which no racing boat will set its\r\ndainty keel, London gathers on March afternoons to wait for the return\r\nof the practising crews, and to watch the blue-scarved oarsmen in and\r\nout of the boathouses and the balcony windows. There is somewhere an air\r\nof the sea-side about that stretch of gravel and open river bank; it is\r\nthe sunshine on the varnish of the boats, perhaps, or a smell of tar in\r\nthe wind, or of salt from the weeds that the tides leave dry; or is it\r\nthe banjo of the occasional nigger blacked to get pence from the waiting\r\ncrowd? On a September day a year or two ago, when Cambridge within a\r\nweek was to race Harvard, I saw on that strip of road one of the very\r\nlast of the genuine London Punch-and-Judy shows. Toby, of course, had\r\ngone; dogs may sit no more in frills to cadge for coppers. But the rest\r\nof it was correct enough; the chequered canvas, of the proper shade of\r\nblue, draped the wooden frame discreetly at the right moment; there was\r\nthe old interval of suspense, the old, the piercing squeal, the\r\ndexterous cock of the red legs over the balcony; the crocodile came and\r\nthe hangman, and the devil; I watched them all. So did two of the\r\nHarvard crew, and did not know their luck. Nothing of English pride\r\nstirred in the blood of those two stalwart young men; they walked off\r\neven before the turn of the hangman.\r\n\r\nEast of Putney the river is a thoroughfare of London, and the names\r\nalong the Surrey side are London names. Lambeth Palace has already\r\nincluded itself in Mrs. E.T. Cook's _Highways and Byways in London_, and\r\nso has Vauxhall, and the church of St. Saviour's, Southwark, the finest\r\nof all churches which once looked over Surrey fields. But Kennington, no\r\nmatter how near it lies to London omnibuses and London tube railways,\r\ncan never be anywhere but in Surrey; Kennington with its memories of the\r\n'Forty-five, and the Chartists, and, a much stronger link with county\r\nhistory than mere memories of the past, Kennington Oval, the visible,\r\nflat, noble cricket ground which stands for the story of all Surrey\r\ncricket of the past half century. The Oval is scarcely half a mile from\r\nVauxhall Bridge and the river; but it is the centre of the county for\r\nthose who watch Surrey cricket.\r\n\r\nOnce the Oval was part of Kennington Common; even in 1845 the solid road\r\nwhich circles the ground was no more than a ditch and a quickset hedge.\r\nBut a hundred years before 1845! Cricket, even then, was a game in\r\nSurrey. Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, and father of George III, was\r\nintroducing his favourite pastime to the nobles and the gentlemen. In\r\n1737 Kent played Surrey and London on Kennington Common, and round the\r\npavilion set up for the Prince of Wales there was so great a crush of\r\nspectators that a poor woman fell and had her leg broken. The Prince\r\ngave her ten guineas. That was a cricketer. And yet, within eight years,\r\nKennington was back among the vilest barbarities of the Middle Ages. The\r\n'Forty-five was to set a mark of ferocious savagery in Kennington annals\r\nhardly surpassed by Tyburn. The Earl of Kennington (that, with the\r\nnickname of 'Butcher,' was one of the titles of the Duke of Cumberland)\r\nhad sent to gaol in Southwark nine officers whom he had taken prisoner\r\nat Carlisle, fighting for Charles Edward Stuart. They were ordered for\r\nexecution, and on July 30, at eleven o'clock in the morning, were taken\r\non three sledges to Kennington Common. The gallows were there, the\r\nblock, the faggots. The prisoners were allowed to pray among themselves.\r\nThen they were pinioned and placed in the cart under the gallows; the\r\nfires were lighted, the cart moved away. Before they were dead they were\r\ncut down, beheaded, disembowelled and their hearts burned in the fire;\r\nthe executioner, throwing in the heart of the last, who was no more than\r\na boy, cried 'God save King George!' Part of the crowd answered with a\r\nshout; the rest looked on in sorrow. The boy who suffered with the elder\r\nmen was James Dawson, and Shenstone wrote a ballad on his death. He had\r\nbeen engaged to be married to a young girl, who insisted on seeing her\r\nlover's last moments. When all was over, she threw herself back in the\r\ncoach, called to him that she followed him, and as she spoke, died.\r\n\r\nAnother gathering on Kennington Common might have had more wholesale\r\nconsequences. The Chartists met there in 1848. Feargus O'Connor was\r\ntheir leader, and he and the petition which the delegates were to take\r\nto the House of Commons went out in two large cars. The petition went\r\nfirst, drawn by four horses, and piled up like bales of cotton; the car\r\nwas decorated with flags, banners, and mottoes, and so were the horses.\r\nThen came O'Connor and the delegates, equally superb in bunting. They\r\ndrove down Holborn and across Blackfriars Bridge, and on Kennington\r\nCommon an enormous crowd, between 15,000 and 50,000, the different\r\naccounts say, received the banners and the delegates with loud cheers.\r\nBut no bloodshed followed. O'Connor was informed that the crowd could\r\nnot be allowed to march to the House of Commons, where, indeed, they\r\nwould have found the Duke of Wellington with cannon. The Chartist leader\r\nmade two eloquent speeches, and the chairman declared the meeting at an\r\nend. The delegates' horses were whipped up so hurriedly that the\r\ndelegates fell to the bottom of the cart; three cabs drove up and took\r\ncharge of the bales of petitions, and the meeting was at an end. One\r\ndetail which the contemporary historian gives of the finish has a\r\nfascinating echo half of Ainsworth, half of Dickens. \"The horses became\r\nrestive and began to kick. Then was distinctly heard from many quarters\r\nthe peculiar cry of the young London thieves.\" What was it like? Can\r\nanybody do it to-day?\r\n\r\nThe great crowds at Kennington to-day come to see better sights than\r\ncarts and banners. Surrey cricket has focussed itself at Kennington;\r\nrather curiously, it has happened that Surrey plays cricket to-day on no\r\nother ground. Kent and Sussex, two neighbours, play their county matches\r\non three grounds or four; Surrey, which has traditions at Mitcham and\r\nDorking, has shrunk back to Kennington only. And Kennington, long ago,\r\nwas nearly lost to cricket. A year after the Chartists had crowded over\r\nthe Common, the County Club was in debt for L70. The story of the paying\r\nof the debt and the revival of the club has the real ring. The club met\r\nand were in despair; they could not hope, with such a debt, to play\r\nmatches. The Bishop of Tasmania, in his entertaining little _History of\r\nKennington_, tells (in 1889) the story:--\r\n\r\n\"The meeting almost decided to break up the club; and I suppose, had\r\nsuch a vote been carried, the Oval would have been at once built over\r\nand some very happy memories of Kennington would never have existed at\r\nall. It is to the present Lord Bessborough that we owe the continuance\r\nof Cricket upon the Oval. He was Vice-President at the time, and\r\nsuggested that the L70 should be paid off by allowing six gentlemen to\r\nbecome Life Members by paying down L12 apiece. A gentleman present next\r\nsaid 'who would pay L12 to be a Life Member of a bankrupt Club?' 'I\r\nwill,' said Old Mr. Cressingham, one of the oldest members: and 'I\r\nwill,' said five others, of whom Mr. Ponsonby was one. Lord Bessborough,\r\nin writing of this memorable meeting, adds--'Looking back to that\r\ndistant day I fear I have been a bad bargain to the Club by becoming a\r\nLife Member for L12.'\"\r\n\r\nNothing of the country and little of the past belongs to Kennington's\r\nneighbours. Stockwell, which perhaps sees a hansom as often as a\r\nmotor-car, once named as a native one of the greatest of English\r\nracehorses. Camberwell, when willows grew about a village stream, long\r\nsince dry, named a butterfly; but Camberwell Beauties, though they sleep\r\nsometimes in Surrey woodstacks, and flaunt their white-laced wings in\r\nSurrey sunshine perhaps twice in a summer, fly no more by brooks in\r\nCamberwell. Perhaps in the old days the Tradescants, who lived near\r\nVauxhall, used to catch them. The Tradescants, father and son, were\r\ngreat naturalists and collectors, and at their house they got together\r\nthe museum of rarities which after their death came to the Ashmolean\r\nMuseum at Oxford. John Tradescant the son made a list of them, and\r\nthough Oxford ungratefully hid the collection in an outhouse and only\r\ndiscovered it again in 1882, many of the curiosities he mentions move\r\nundergraduates to surprise to-day. In the original list are strange\r\nfowls. 'Some kindes of birds, their egges, beaks, feathers, clawes, and\r\nspurres' begin the list of chapters, and then come a crocodile and an\r\n'egge given for a dragon's egge,' and 'Easter egges of the patriarchs of\r\nJerusalem.' 'Two feathers of the phoenix tayle' I do not remember at\r\nOxford, nor 'a cherrystone holding ten dozen tortoiseshell combs, made\r\nby Edward Gibbons.' But I think the Ashmolean collection still holds the\r\n'flea chains of silver and gold, with 300 links apiece, and yet but an\r\ninch long,' and, of course, the Oxford dodo's skin is famous. It was not\r\na dodo, though, to John Tradescant. It was a 'dodar, from the island of\r\nMauritius: it is not able to flie, being so big.' The wrong thing about\r\nit all is that the name of the Tradescants ought to be associated with\r\nthe collection, and not the name Ashmole. It was never Ashmole's to give\r\nto Oxford. Ashmole was a rich and greedy neighbour, and though\r\nTradescant left his museum to his widow and after her death to Oxford,\r\nhe, the polite Ashmole, bullied Mrs. Tradescant until she signed a paper\r\nstating that she had begged him to take the museum for his own. She\r\nwould have signed anything, poor lady, to get rid of him. She suffered\r\nso much from persecution from the generous donor of her husband's museum\r\nto Oxford, that she drowned herself in a pond; a few months before\r\nhaving signed a statement that she had 'caused a great heap of earth\r\nrubbish to be laid against his garden wall'--doubtless she caused\r\nnothing of the sort--'so high that on the 1st day of August last, in the\r\nnight, by the help thereof, it is strongly presumed that thieves got\r\nover the same and robbed the said Mr. Ashmole of 32 cocks and hens.'\r\n\r\nEasternmost of Surrey in London, Rotherhithe lies about the docks of the\r\nPool. The Pool should have a book to itself, and will not go into mine;\r\nbut of Rotherhithe ashore there is a record which deserves keeping.\r\nAubrey, or his later editor, gives a list of the Rotherhithe residents\r\nwho contributed to the rebuilding of St. Mary's church, and the names,\r\nsorted and classified, should be set aside for a future Dickens. Here\r\nare a few of them:--Bloice, Figgins, Cuthbert Finkle, Gollop, Cronker,\r\nShadrick Lifter, Walter Mell, Mr. Jeremiah Rosher, Mr. Jonas Shish, Mr.\r\nNathaniel Stiffon, Mr. Matthias Wallraven, Mr. Scroggs, Mr. Jeffery\r\nSaffery, Mr. Volentine Teed.\r\n\r\nBermondsey, which has kept the Tooley Street of the Three Tailors, but\r\nelsewhere preserves names only instead of stones, has memories of one of\r\nthe three Surrey Abbeys. It was founded as a priory for Cluniac monks by\r\nAlwin Child, a citizen of London, in 1082, and it became an Abbey some\r\nthree hundred years later. Bermondsey Priory had a church of some note,\r\nfor in it was a crucifix which the old chronicles describe vaguely as\r\nhaving been found near the Thames. The crucifix attracted special\r\npilgrimages, and when the monasteries were ended, it disappeared. 'There\r\nwas the pictor of Saynte Saviour that had stood in Barmsey Abbey many\r\nyeres in Southwarke takyn down,' a diarist writes at the time. All that\r\nremains of the church and crucifix is the name, which has come to St.\r\nSaviour's, or the church of St. Mary Overie--the style now is to call it\r\nSouthwark Cathedral. St. Saviour's belongs to London highways, as I have\r\nsaid, but I may take for Surrey the lines, not already quoted for\r\nLondon, I think, which are set on the tomb of Richard Humble, Alderman\r\nof London and ancestor of Wards and Dudleys. The tomb has busied many\r\npens, the verses remain to be read--are they too well known to be\r\nwritten out again?\r\n\r\n    Like to the damask rose you see\r\n    Or like the blossom on the tree,\r\n    Or like the dainty flower of May,\r\n    Or like the morning of the day,\r\n    Or like the sun or like the shade,\r\n    Or like the gourd which Jonas had,\r\n\r\n    Even so is Man whose thread is spun,\r\n    Drawn out and cut, and so is done!\r\n\r\n    The rose withers, the blossom blasteth,\r\n    The flower fades, the morning hasteth,\r\n    The sun sets, the shadow flies,\r\n    The gourd consumes, the man he dies.\r\n\r\nBeaumont wrote the lines, legend says; perhaps wrongly, but they have\r\nthe Elizabethan life and ring.\r\n\r\nIf one had to choose a dozen square yards of London to sum up the Surrey\r\nside, where should they be? For me, there could be no choice. One spot\r\nwould demand the first, the only place. It would be where Waterloo\r\nBridge touches the Surrey shore; where you may look south to a Surrey\r\nhill by Sydenham, and north to half the panorama of London, from St.\r\nPaul's to Westminster Abbey. There, on the first few yards of the\r\nbridge, above the little hill which shrinks the wide roadway into a neck\r\nand stops overladen drays like a wall, blows the aura of all London that\r\ncrowds south of the river, all Surrey that belongs to the London Thames.\r\nThe business of the town and the country mingles with the business of\r\nthe river and the sea. An afternoon in December, the month of months to\r\nknow London in, is the time to be there. Up stream from the Nore on an\r\neast wind rides the damp of salt and of estuary fogs; about you are the\r\nsteam of sweating horses and the pungent clinging scents of malt and\r\nhops and brewing; up on a yellow tide under the arches of the bridge\r\nswings a string of barges, piled with bales of hay. A flock of pigeons\r\nsways and wheels in the sky, drops to the roofs, settles with a clatter,\r\nsails up into the sky again. Black-headed gulls, in their winter suits\r\nof dove-colour and white, walk about the muddy edge of the rising tide,\r\ndrift on the stream like torn paper, soar and hang in the wind above the\r\nbridge, peering this way and that for the fish and bread the Londoners\r\ngive them; or late in the afternoon wing quiet journeys into unknown\r\nspaces of western light. Beyond the bridge the lights dot orange sparks\r\nin the films and shades of great buildings and the Embankment roadway.\r\nThat is pure London, and London, too, is most of the Waterloo Road, with\r\nits new hospital, and the roar of the trains from the junction, and the\r\nold curiosity shops with the foreign names, and the wig-makers, and the\r\ncheap furniture spoiling in the rain. But Surrey is there, too; a shop\r\nthat shows cricket bats, and another that has fruit-ladders, and, above\r\nall, the little shops that offer boxes of pansies and delphinium roots\r\nand hyacinth bulbs all the seasons round to Surrey men leaving London\r\nbehind them in the evening. Surrey recollects that she is not quite\r\nLondon in the Waterloo Road; she plays cricket and plants pansies.\r\n\r\nThat would be the Surrey side I should choose, with the magic of the\r\ntide water about it and somewhere, however faint, the scent of the\r\nSurrey gardens. But the old, the oldest Surrey side? That belongs to the\r\nriver-shore south of London Bridge, where once, too, Londoners could\r\ncross from crowded wood and brick to walk among Surrey hawthorn and\r\nSurrey daisies. The roar and the soot of the Borough have set that strip\r\nof country deep in London, hardly divided by the water. But it was\r\nthere, when Chaucer's nine-and-twenty pilgrims lay at the Tabard inn,\r\nthat Surrey began for Londoners and for all who had come to the 'dere\r\nand sweete citye' of which Chaucer sings to journey south from the\r\nThames on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. The Tabard inn is no more; the\r\nfire that swept over Southwark ten years after the fire of London\r\ndestroyed the building Chaucer knew. The piety of a later day raised\r\nanother Tabard, perhaps like the old Tabard with the same galleries and\r\nbalustrades to look down from upon pilgrims and minstrels and monks and\r\nfools. But that Tabard inn became the Talbot in a careless age, and as\r\nthe Talbot it was razed to the ground forty years ago, when nobody\r\nminded what became of the old inns and churches and the things best\r\nworth keeping in old Surrey. The Tabard has gone, but the ancient road\r\nremains. Smoke and stone are about it, where once it stretched out bare\r\namong green fields; but the fields are there, for those who can see\r\nthem, behind the veil of smoke, and through them a wayfarer may still\r\ntravel with the Knight who loved freedom and courtesy, the Monk shaking\r\nhis belled bridle, the Ploughman on his mare, and the dainty fingered\r\nPrioress with her eyes as grey as glass, riding to join other pilgrims\r\ntravelling east to Canterbury by the old road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    Abbot, George, Archbishop of Canterbury, 72, 74-6, 80, 317,
