MATTHEW ARNOLD somewhere devotes a grateful sentence to the women\r\nwho have left a fragrance in literary history, and whose loss of long\r\nago can yet inspire men of to-day with indescribable regret. Lady\r\nDanvers is surely one of these. As John Donne’s dear friend, and George\r\nHerbert’s mother, she has a double poetic claim, like her unforgotten\r\ncontemporary, Mary Sidney, for whom was made an everlasting epitaph.\r\nIf Dr. Donne’s fraternal fame have not quite the old lustre of the\r\nincomparable Sir Philip’s, it is, at least, a greater honor to own\r\nHerbert for son than to have perpetuated the race of Pembroke. Nor is\r\nit an inharmonious thing to remember, in thus calling up, in order to\r\nrival it, the sweet memory of “Sidney’s sister,” that Herbert and\r\nPembroke have long been, and are yet, married names.\r\n\r\nMagdalen, the youngest child of Sir Richard Newport, and of Margaret\r\nBromley, his wife, herself daughter of that Bromley who was\r\nPrivy-Councillor, Lord Chief-Justice, and executor to Henry VIII., was\r\nborn in High Ercall, Salop; the loss or destruction of parish registers\r\nleaves us but 1561-62 as the probable date. Of princely stock, with\r\nthree sisters and an only brother, and heir to virtue and affluence,\r\nshe could look with the right pride of unfallen blood upon “the many\r\nfair coats the Newports bear” over their graves at Wroxeter. It was\r\nthe day of learned and thoughtful girls; and this girl seems to have\r\nbeen at home with book and pen, with lute and viol. She married, in\r\nthe flower of her youth, Richard Herbert, Esquire, of Blache Hall,\r\nMontgomery, black-haired and black-bearded, as were all his line; a man\r\nof some intellectual training, and of noted courage, descended from\r\na distinguished brother of the yet more distinguished Sir Richard\r\nHerbert of Edward IV.’s time, and from the most ancient rank of Wales\r\nand England. At Eyton in Salop, in 1581, was born their eldest child,\r\nEdward, afterwards Lord Herbert of Cherbury, a writer who is still the\r\npuzzle and delight of Continental critics. He is said to have been a\r\nbeautiful boy, and not very robust; his first speculation with his\r\ninfant tongue was the piercing query: “How came I into this world?” But\r\nhis next brother, Richard, was of another stamp; and went his frank,\r\nflashing, fighting way through Europe, “with scars of four-and-twenty\r\nwounds upon him, to his grave” at Bergen-op-Zoom, with William, the\r\nthird son, following in his soldierly footsteps. Charles grew up\r\nreserved and studious, and died, like his paternal uncle, a dutiful\r\nFellow of New College, Oxford. The fifth of these Herberts, “a soul\r\ncomposed of harmonies,” as Cotton said of him, and destined to make the\r\nname beloved among all readers of English, was George, the poet, the\r\nsaintly “parson of Fuggleston and Bemerton.” Henry, his junior, with\r\nwhom George had a sympathy peculiarly warm and long, became in his\r\nmanhood Master of the Revels, and held the office for over fifty years.\r\n“You and I are alone left to brother it,” Lord Herbert of Cherbury once\r\nwrote him, in a mood more tender than his wont, when all else of that\r\nradiant family had gone into dust. The youngest of Magdalen Newport’s\r\nsons was Thomas, “a posthumous,” traveller, sailor, and master of a\r\nship in the war against Algiers. Elizabeth, Margaret, and Frances\r\nwere the daughters, of whom Izaak Walton says, with satisfaction,\r\nthat they lived to be examples of virtue, and to do good to their\r\ngeneration. None of them made an illustrious match. Margaret married\r\na Vaughan. Frances secured unto herself the patronymic Brown, and was\r\nhappily seconded by Elizabeth, George Herbert’s “dear sick sister,”\r\nwho became Mistress Jones. In the south chancel transept of Montgomery\r\nChurch, where Richard Herbert the elder had been buried three years\r\nbefore, there was erected in 1600, at his wife’s cost, a large canopied\r\nalabaster altar-tomb, with two portrait-figures recumbent. All around\r\nit, in the quaint and affectionate boast of the age, are the small\r\nimages of these seven sons and three daughters; “Job’s number and Job’s\r\ndistribution,” as she once remarked, and as her biographers failed\r\nnot to repeat after her. But their kindred ashes are widely sundered,\r\nand “as content with six foot as with the moles of Adrianus.” This at\r\nMontgomery is the only known representation of the Lady Magdalen. Her\r\neffigy lies at her husband’s left, the palms folded, the eyes open, the\r\nfull hair rolled back from a low brow, beneath a charming and simple\r\nhead-dress. Nothing can be nobler than the whole look of the face, like\r\nher in her prime, and reminding one of her son’s loving epithet, “my\r\nJuno.” The short-sighted inscription upon the slab yet includes her\r\nname.\r\n\r\nNever had an army of brilliant and requiring children a more excellent\r\nmother. “_Severa parens_,” her gentle George called her in his\r\nscholarly verses; and such she was, with the mingled sagacity and\r\njoyousness which made up her character. If we are to believe their\r\nown testimony, the leading members of her young family were of\r\nexcessively peppery Cymric temperaments, and worthy to call out that\r\n“manlier part” of her which Dr. Donne, who had every opportunity of\r\nobserving it in play, was so quick to praise. There is a passage in\r\na letter of Sir Thomas Lacy, addressed to Edward Herbert, touching\r\nupon “the knowledge I had how ill you can digest the least indignity.”\r\n“Holy George Herbert” himself, in 1618, commended to his dear brother\r\nHenry the gospel of self-honoring: “It is the part of a poor spirit to\r\nundervalue himself and blush.” And physical courage went hand in hand\r\nwith this blameless haughtiness of the Herberts, a pretty collateral\r\nproof of which may be adduced from a message of Sir Henry Jones to his\r\nbrother-in-law, the other Henry just mentioned, concerning a gift for\r\nhis little nephew. “If my cozen, William Herbert your sonne . . . be\r\nready for the rideing of a horse, I will provide him with a Welch nagg\r\nthat shall be as mettlesome as himself.” There is no doubt that all\r\nthis racial fire was fostered by one woman. “Thou my root, and my most\r\nfirm rock, O my mother!” George cried, long after in the _Parentalia_,\r\naware that he owed to her his high ideals, and the strength of\r\ncharacter which is born of self-discipline.\r\n\r\n“God gave her,” says one of her two devoted annalists, who we wish\r\nwere not so brief and meagre of detail—“God gave her such a comeliness\r\nas though she was not proud of it, yet she was so content with it as\r\nnot to go about to mend it by any art.” Her fortune was large, her\r\nbenevolence wide-spreading. All the countryside knew her for the living\r\nrepresentative of the ever-hospitable houses of Newport and Bromley.\r\n“She gave not on some great days,” continues Dr. Donne, “or at solemn\r\ngoings abroad; but as God’s true almoners, the sun and moon, that pass\r\non in a continual doing of good; as she received her daily bread from\r\nGod, so daily she distributed it, and imparted it to others.” In these\r\nyears of her wifehood and widowhood at Montgomery Castle (the “romancy\r\nplace” dating from the eleventh century, and ruined, like the fine\r\nold house at High Ercall, during the Civil Wars), and afterwards at\r\nOxford and London, she reared her happy crew of boys and girls in an\r\nair of generosity and honor; training them to habits of hardiness and\r\nsimplicity, and to the equal relish of work and play. “Herself with\r\nher whole family (as a church in that elect lady’s house, to whom John\r\nwrote his second Epistle) did every Sabbath shut up the day at night\r\nwith a general, with a cheerful singing of psalms.” One may guess at\r\nyoung Richard’s turmoil in-doors, and at the little Elizabeth’s soft,\r\npatient ways, and think of George (on Sundays at any rate) as the child\r\nof content, “the contesseration of elegances” worthy Archdeacon Oley\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\nThe fair and stately matron moving over them and among them was not\r\nwithout her prejudices. “I was once,” Edward testifies, “in danger of\r\ndrowning, learning to swim. My mother, upon her blessing, charged me\r\nnever to learn swimming; telling me, further, that she had learned of\r\nmore drowned than saved by it.” Though the given reason failed to\r\nimpress him, he adds, the commandment did; so that the accomplished\r\nCrichton of Cherbury, who understood alchemy, broke his way through\r\nmetaphysics, and rode the Great Horse; the ambassador, author, and\r\nbeau, to whom Ben Jonson sent his greeting:\r\n\r\n    “What man art thou that art so many men,\r\n     All-virtuous Herbert?”\r\n\r\neven he lacked, on principle, the science of keeping himself alive\r\nin an alien element, because it had been pronounced less risky to\r\ndie outright! It was a pretty paradox, and one which sets down our\r\nhigh-minded Magdalen as quite feminine, quite human.\r\n\r\nHer Edward was matriculated in 1595 at University College, Oxford,[1]\r\nfor which he seemed to retain no great partiality; he bequeathed his\r\nbooks, like a loyal Welshman, to Jesus College, instead, and his\r\nmanuscripts to the Bodleian Library. In 1598, when he was little\r\nmore than seventeen, he was wedded to his cousin Mary Herbert, of\r\nSt. Gillian in Monmouthshire. Her age was one-and-twenty; she was an\r\nheiress, enjoined by her father’s will to marry a Herbert or forfeit\r\nher estates; she was also almost a philosopher. There was no wild\r\naffection on either side, but the marriage promised rather well, both\r\npersons having resources; and no real catastrophe befell either in\r\nafter-life. Much as she desired the match for worldly motives, the\r\nchief promoter of it was too solicitous for her tall dreamer of a\r\nson, who underwent the pleasing peril of having Queen Bess clap him\r\non the cheek, not to take the whole weight of conjugal direction on\r\nher own shoulders. Without undue officiousness, but with the masterly\r\nforesight of a shrewd saint, she moved to Oxford from Montgomery with\r\nher younger children and their tutors, in order to handle Mistress\r\nHerbert’s husband during his minority. “She continued there with him,”\r\nsays Walton, in his _Life of George Herbert_, “and still kept him in\r\na moderate awe of herself, and so much under her own eye as to see and\r\nconverse with him daily; but she managed this power over him without\r\nany such rigid sourness as might make her company a torment to her\r\nchild, but with such a sweetness and compliance with the recreations\r\nand pleasures of youth as did incline him willingly to spend much of\r\nhis time in the company of his dear and careful mother.”\r\n\r\nIt was during this stay that she contracted the chivalrous friendship\r\nwhich has embalmed her tranquil memory. Dr. John Donne (not ordained\r\nuntil 1614, and indeed not Dr. Donne then at all, but “Jack Donne,”\r\nhis profaner self) had been at Cadiz with Essex, and had wandered over\r\nthe face of Europe; and he came back, accidentally, to Oxford during\r\nthe most troubled year of his early prime. It was no strange place to\r\nhim,[2] who had been, at eleven, the Pico della Mirandola of Hart\r\nHall, and whose relatives seem to have resided always in the town.\r\nThere and then, however, he cast his bright eye upon Excellence, and in\r\nhis own phrase,\r\n\r\n    “—dared love that, and say so, too,\r\n     And forget the He and She.”\r\n\r\nWe can do no better than cite a celebrated and beautiful passage, once\r\nmore from Walton: “This amity, begun at this time and place, was not\r\nan amity that polluted their souls, but an amity made up of a chain of\r\nsuitable inclinations and virtues; an amity like that of St. Chrysostom\r\nto his dear and virtuous Olympias, whom, in his letters, he calls his\r\nsaint; or an amity, indeed, more like that of St. Hierom to his Paula,\r\nwhose affection to her was such that he turned poet in his old age, and\r\nthen made her epitaph, wishing all his body were turned into tongues\r\nthat he might declare her just praises to posterity.” How these words\r\nremind one of the sweet historic mention which Condivi gives to the\r\nrelations between Vittoria Colonna and Michelangelo! The little English\r\nidyl of friendship and the great Italian one run parallel in much.\r\n\r\nDonne’s trenchant _Satires_, some of the earliest and very best in\r\nthe language, were already written, and he was not without the hint\r\nof fame. Born in 1573, he was but eight years the senior of Edward\r\nHerbert, and not more than a dozen years the junior of Edward Herbert’s\r\nmother. To her two sons, also, who were to figure as men of letters,\r\nhe was sincerely attached from the first, and had a marked and lasting\r\ninfluence on their minds. Donne had the superabundance of mental power\r\nwhich Mr. Minto has pointed out as the paradoxical cause of his failure\r\nto become a great poet. He was a three-storied soul, as the French say:\r\na spirit of many sides and moods, a life-long dreamer of good and bad\r\ndreams. To his restless, incisive intelligence his contemporaries, with\r\nJonson and Carew at their head, bowed in hyperboles of acclaim. He had\r\na changeful conscience, often antagonized and often appeased. There\r\nwas a strain in him of strong joy, for he was descended through his\r\nmother from pleasant John Heywood the dramatist, and from the father\r\nof that great and merry-hearted gentleman, Sir Thomas More. If ever\r\nman needed vitality to buoy him over sorrows heavy and vast, it was\r\nDonne in his “yeasting youth.” Thrown, through no fault but his own,\r\nfrom his old footholds of religion and occupation, and unable, despite\r\nhis versatile and alert genius, to grind a steady living from the hard\r\nmills of the world, he was in the midst of a bitter plight when the\r\nfriends worthy of him found a heavenly opportunity which they did not\r\nlet go by, and made his acceptance of their favor a rich gift unto\r\nthemselves. Foremost among these, besides Lady Herbert, were Sir Robert\r\nDrury of Drury Lane, and a kinsman, Sir Francis Woolly, of Pirford,\r\nSurrey, fated to die in his youth, both of whom gave the Donnes, for\r\nsome nine consecutive years, the use of their princely houses. John\r\nDonne had been in the service of the Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere,\r\nand lost place and purse by the opposition to his marriage with his\r\n“_lectissima dilectissimaque_,” Anne More, who was Lady Ellesmere’s\r\nniece, the daughter of Sir George More of Loxly, Lieutenant of the\r\nTower, and probably a distant cousin of his own. No reverses, however,\r\ncould beat the pathetic cheer out of him. “Anne Donne,[3] undone,” was\r\none of his inveterate teary jests over the state of things at home. He\r\nwrote once, with sickness, poverty, and despair at his elbow: “If God\r\nshould ease us with burials, I know not how to perform even that. But I\r\nflatter myself that I am dying, too, for I cannot waste faster than by\r\nsuch griefs.” Five of his twelve children passed before their father to\r\nthe grave, the good domestic daughter Constance upholding him always,\r\nand keeping the house together. But just as hope dawned with his\r\nappointment to the Lectureship of Lincoln’s Inn, heavenward suddenly,\r\nwith her youngest-born, in 1617, went his dear and faithful wife, whom\r\nhe laid to rest in St. Clement Danes.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when the remorseful old queen died disdainfully on her\r\nchamber-floor at Richmond, the necessities of this family called for\r\ndaily succors, and with a simple and noble delicacy they were supplied.\r\nNor did they cease. Magdalen Herbert was a “bountiful benefactor,”\r\nDonne “as grateful an acknowledger.” His first letter to her from\r\nMitcham in Surrey, dated July 10, 1607, is made up of terse, tender\r\nthanks, in his heart’s own odd language. He sends her an enclosure of\r\nsonnets and hymns, “lost to us,” says Walton, movingly, “but doubtless\r\nthey were such as they two now sing in heaven.” Dr. Grosart, with a\r\ngreat show of justice, claims that the sequence called _La Corona_, and\r\nfamiliar to latter-day readers, are the identical sonnets passed from\r\none to the other. During this same month of July we know that, paying a\r\ncall in his “London, plaguey London,” and finding his friend abroad,[4]\r\nDr. Donne consoled himself by leaving a courtliest message: “Your\r\nmemory is a state-cloth and presence which I reverence, though you be\r\naway;” and went back after to his “sallads and onions” at Mitcham, or\r\nto his solitary lodgings near Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThe attachment, close and deferent on both sides, was continued without\r\na breach, and with the intention, at least, of “almost daily letters.”\r\nThoreau, quoting Chaucer, so saluted Mrs. Emerson: “You have helped\r\nto keep my life on loft.” No meaner service than this was his dear\r\nlady’s to John Donne, often heretofore astray in the slough of doubt\r\nand dissipation; she fed more than his little children, clothed more\r\nthan his body, and fostered anew in him that faith in humanity which\r\nis the well-spring of good works. He was not a poet of Leigh Hunt’s\r\ninnocent temperament, who could accept benefits gladly and gracefully\r\nfrom any appreciator; his soul dwelt too remote and proud in her\r\naccustomed citadels. But this loving help, thrust upon him, he took\r\nwith dignity, and after 1621, when he was able, in his own person, to\r\nbefriend others, he gave back gallantly to mankind the blessings he\r\nonce received from two or three. It was something for Magdalen Herbert\r\nto have saved a master-name to English letters, and kept in his unique\r\nplace the poet, interesting beyond many, whose fantastic but real force\r\nswayed generations of thinking and singing men; it was something, also,\r\nto have won in return the words which were his gold coin of payment.\r\nNowhere is Donne’s sentiment more genuine, his workmanship more happy\r\nand less complex, than in the verses dedicated to her blameless\r\nname. They have a lucidity unsurpassed among the yet straightforward\r\nlyrics of their day. Drayton’s self, who died in the same year with\r\nDonne, might have addressed to the lady of Eyton so much of his noble\r\nextravagance;\r\n\r\n    “Queens hereafter shall be glad to live\r\n     Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise.”\r\n\r\nYet in these eulogies, as in most of the graver contemporaneous poems\r\nof the sort, there is little personality to be detected; the homage\r\nhas rather a floating outline, an unapproaching music, exquisite and\r\nawed. Donne gives, sometimes, the large Elizabethan measure:\r\n\r\n    “Is there any good which is not she?”\r\n\r\nIn the so-called _Elegy, The Autumnal_, written on leaving Oxford, he\r\nstarts off with a well-known cherishable strophe:\r\n\r\n    “No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace\r\n     As I have seen in one autumnal face.”\r\n\r\nThe entire poem is a monody on the encroachments of years, and neatly\r\nchronological:\r\n\r\n    “If we love things long-sought, age is a thing\r\n     Which we are fifty years in compassing;\r\n     If transitory things, which soon decay,\r\n     Age must be loveliest at the latest day.”\r\n\r\nIt strikes the modern ear as maladroit enough that a woman in her yet\r\nsunshiny forties, and a most comely woman to boot, should have required\r\nprosody’s ingenious excuses for wrinkles and kindred damages. Was life\r\nso hard as that in “the spacious days”? Shakespeare, in agreement with\r\nHorace, had already reminded his handsome “Will” of the pitiless and\r\ntoo expeditious hour,\r\n\r\n    “When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\r\n     And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field!”\r\n\r\nwhich also seems, to a nice historical sense, somewhat staggering. The\r\nclose of Donne’s little homily is perfect, and full of the winning\r\nmelancholy which was part of his birthright in art, whenever he allowed\r\nhimself direct and homely expression:\r\n\r\n                            “May still\r\n    My love descend! and journey down the hill,\r\n    Not panting after growing beauties; so\r\n    I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.”\r\n\r\nSuch was John Donne’s first known tribute to his friend. She must have\r\nbeen early and thoroughly familiar with his manuscripts, which were\r\npassed about freely, Dr. Grosart thinks, prior to 1613, and which\r\nburned what Massinger would call “no adulterate incense” to herself.\r\nHer bays are to be gleaned off many a tree, and she must have cast a\r\nfrequent influence on Donne’s work, which is not traceable now. He\r\nseems to have had a Crashaw-like devotion to the Christian saint whose\r\ninheritance\r\n\r\n    “Bethina was, and jointure Magdalo,”\r\n\r\nnot unconnected with the fact that some one else was Magdalen also;\r\nnever does he tire of dwelling on the coincidence and the difference.\r\nIn one of his quaintly moralizing songs, he goes seeking a “true-love”\r\nprimrose, where but on Montgomery Hill! for he is hers, by all\r\nchivalrous tokens, as much as he may be. Again he cites, and almost\r\nwith humor:\r\n\r\n                  “that perplexing eye\r\n    Which equally claims love and reverence.”\r\n\r\nAnd his platonics make their honorable challenge at the end of some\r\nfine lines:\r\n\r\n    “So much do I love her choice, that I\r\n     Would fain love him that shall be loved of her!”\r\n\r\nThere was prescience in that couplet. As early, at least, as 1607-8,\r\nthe widow’s long privacy ended, probably while she was at her “howse\r\nat Charing Cross,” watching over the progress of her son George at\r\nWestminster School; and he that was “loved of her” was the grandson of\r\nthe last Lord Latimer of the Nevilles, junior brother of a nobleman\r\nwho perished with Essex in 1602, and brother and heir of that Sir\r\nHenry Danvers who was created Earl of Danby in 1625 for his services\r\nin Ireland, and who literally left a green memory as the founder of\r\nthe pleasant Physic Gardens at Oxford. The name of Danvers, the kindly\r\nstep-father, is one of the noteworthy omissions of Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury’s _Autobiography_. But George Herbert was devoted to him,\r\nas his many letters show, and turned to him, never in vain, during\r\nhis restless years at Cambridge; and into his circle of relatives,\r\nwith romantic suddenness, he afterwards married. Sir John Danvers, of\r\nDauntsey, Wilts, was twenty years younger than his wife. It is worth\r\nwhile to quote the very deft and courtly statement of the case made at\r\nthe last by Dr. Donne: “The natural endowments of her person were such\r\nas had their part in drawing and fixing the affections of such a person\r\nas by his birth and youth and interest in great favors at court, and\r\nlegal proximity to great possessions in the world, might justly have\r\npromised him acceptance in what family soever, or upon what person\r\nsoever, he had directed. . . . He placed them here, neither diverted\r\nthence, nor repented since. For as the well-tuning of an instrument\r\nmakes higher and lower strings of one sound, so the inequality of their\r\nyears was thus reduced to an evenness, that she had a cheerfulness\r\nagreeable to his youth, and he had a sober staidness conformable to her\r\nmore advanced years. So that I would not consider her at so much more\r\nthan forty, nor him at so much less than thirty, at that time; but as\r\ntheir persons were made one and their fortunes made one by marriage,\r\nso I would put their years into one number, and finding a sixty\r\nbetween them, think them thirty apiece; for as twins of one hour they\r\nlived.”[5]\r\n\r\nIn the August of 1607, a masque by John Marston was given in the now\r\nruined castle of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, eighteen miles from Leicester, as\r\nan entertainment devised by Lord Huntingdon and his young wife, the\r\nLady Elizabeth Stanley, to welcome her mother, Alice, Countess-Dowager\r\nof Derby,[6] “the first night of her honor’s arrival at the house of\r\nAshby.” Fourteen noble ladies took part in the masque, and among them\r\nwas “Mris Da’vers.” The name may, perhaps, be recognized as that of the\r\nsubject of this sketch, for Sir John Danvers was not knighted until the\r\nfollowing year; and it has been so recognized by interested scholars\r\nwho have searched Nichols’s _Progresses of James I_. And yet we cannot\r\nbe too sure that we have her before us, in the wreaths and picturesque\r\ndraperies of the amateur stage; for there was another Mistress Da’vers\r\nat court, whose purported letter, dated February 3, 1613, signed with\r\nher confusing Christian names of “Mary Magdaline,” gave great trouble,\r\nthirty years ago, to the experts of the Camden Society. Besides, a\r\nletter of the good gossipy Chamberlain, dated March 3, 1608-9, mentions\r\nas if it were then a piece of fresh news: “Young Davers is likewise\r\nwedded to the widow Herbert, Sir Edward’s mother, of more than twice\r\nhis age.” This would seem to preclude the possibility of the fair\r\nmasquer being the same person.\r\n\r\nThe mother of many Herberts, the “more than forty” bride, was by\r\nnature a home-keeping character. Among the correspondence relating\r\nto Lord Herbert of Cherbury, privately printed in 1886 by the Earl\r\nof Powis, are a few pages which give us invaluable glimpses of the\r\nLondon household. Lady Danvers’s eldest son, who set off upon his\r\ntravels soon after her second marriage, and who applied himself\r\nvigorously to the various diversions of body and mind catalogued\r\nin the _Autobiography_, found himself often pinched for money. In\r\nsuch a strait, not unfamiliar to other fine gentlemen of his day, he\r\ninvariably appealed to the services of the step-father who was his\r\njunior, in England. The latter, writing how “wee are all some what\r\nafter the olde manner, and doe hartely wish you well,” seems to have\r\nbusied himself to some avail, in concert with his brother-in-law, Sir\r\nFrancis Newport (the first Lord Newport), in securing letters of credit\r\nto Milan, Turin, the Netherlands, and elsewhere, and in explaining at\r\nlength, in his long involved sentences, how matters could be bettered.\r\nWhether or not the absent Knight of the Bath had reason to suspect Sir\r\nJohn’s disinterested action when it came to the handling of pounds\r\nand pence, he does not seem, then or after, to have burdened him with\r\nany great harvest of thanks. But Sir John’s faithful wife knew how to\r\ndefend him, in a script of May 12, 1615, which may be quoted precisely\r\nas it stands in the Herbert papers.\r\n\r\n    “To my best beloved sonn, S’r Edward Herbert, Knight,\r\n        “My deare Sonn,\r\n\r\n                        it is straunge to me to here you\r\n    to complayne of want of care of you in your absence\r\n    when my thoughts are seldom removed from you which\r\n    must assuredly set me aworkinge of any thinge may doe\r\n    you good, & for writinge the one of us yf not both\r\n    never let messenges pass without letter, your stay\r\n    abroad is so short in any one place & we so unhappy in\r\n    givinge you contentment as our letters com not to your\r\n    hands which we are sorry for. And to tel you further\r\n    of S’r John Da’vers Love which I dare sweare is to no\r\n    man more, he is & hath beene so careful to keep you\r\n    from lake of money now you are abroad as your Baylife\r\n    faylinge payment as they continually doe & pay no man,\r\n    he goeth to your Merchaunt, offers him self & all the\r\n    powers he can make to supply you as your occasions may\r\n    require, mistake him not, but beleeve me there was\r\n    never a tenderer hart or a lovinger minde in any man\r\n    then is in him towards you who have power to com’aund\r\n    him & all that is his. Now for your Baylifs I must\r\n    tell you they have not yet payed your brothers all\r\n    their Anuities due at Midsom’er past & but half due\r\n    at Christmas last and no news of the rest, this yf\r\n    advauntage were taken might be preiuditiall to you and\r\n    it is ill for your Brothers & very ill you have such\r\n    officers.\r\n\r\n    “I hope it will bringe you home & that is all the good\r\n    can com of this. your sister Johnes hath long beene\r\n    sicke & within this 8 dayes hath brought a boy she is\r\n    so weake as she is much feared by those aboute her. my\r\n    Lady Vachell lyes now adyeinge the bell hath twice gone\r\n    for her. your wife & sweet children are well & herein\r\n    I send you little Florence letter to see what comfort\r\n    you may have of your deare children, let them, my Dear\r\n    sonn, draw you home & affoorde them your care and me\r\n    your comfort that desire more to see you then I desire\r\n    any thinge ells in the world, and now I end with my\r\n    dayly prayer for your health and safe retorne to Your\r\n    ever lovinge mother,\r\n\r\n                                         Magd: Da’vers.\r\n\r\n    “I have received the Pattent of your Br: William, & S’r\r\n    John hath beene with the ambassatore who stayes for S’r\r\n    James Sandaline[7] his cominge.”\r\n\r\nA sympathizing reader, aware of sequences, may wonder whence Sir John\r\ndrew “all the powers he can make”! The dignified letter, with its\r\nundulating syntax and thrifty punctuation, harmonizes with all we\r\nknow of this delightful woman, who could so reproach what she deemed\r\na shortcoming, without a touch of temper. How affectionate is the\r\nreference to the “little Florence” who died young, and to the other\r\nchildren, sufficiently precious to all that household, except to the\r\nwool-gathering chevalier their father, far away! Their innocent faces\r\npeer again through a sweet postscript of their grand-uncle: (“Dick\r\nis here, Ned and Bettye at Haughmond,”) written in the winter, from\r\nEyton, to the truant at the Hague.[8] This same genial Sir Francis\r\nNewport, “imoderately desyring to see you,” confides to his nephew,\r\nduring what he complains of as “a verye drye and hott time”[9] for\r\nShropshire farmers, that “mye syster your mother is confident to take\r\na iourney into these pts this somer, the rather, I think, because yo’r\r\nbrother Vaugh’n is dead & if yo’ have a willing harte you maye come\r\ntyme enough to acco’pany her heare, & would not then the companye bee\r\nmuch the better?” But we fear the little excursion never came off.\r\nEdward Herbert’s next visit to his home, presumably after a four-years’\r\nabsence, was in 1619; and in May of that year he accepted the office\r\nof Ambassador to France, and spread his ready wing again to the\r\nContinent. And the _Athenæ Oxoniensis_ will not let us forget that the\r\ntoo spirited envoy had to be temporarily recalled in 1621, because he\r\nhad “irreverently treated” De Luynes, the powerful but good-for-nothing\r\nConstable of France. It is not insignificant that this was the year in\r\nwhich George Herbert wrote to his mother in one of his consoling moods,\r\nbidding her be of good cheer, albeit her health and wealth were gone,\r\nand the conduct of her children was not very satisfying!\r\n\r\nWe know that Lady Danvers had the “honor, love, obedience, troops of\r\nfriends” which became her, and that she lost none of her influence,\r\nnone of her serene charm. Her poet was much with her in his advancing\r\nage. In July, 1625, while the plague was raging in London, Donne\r\nreminded Sir Henry Wotton of the leisure he enjoyed, golden as\r\nCicero’s, by dating his letter “from S’r John Davor’s house at Chelsey,\r\nof w’ich house & my Lord Carlil’s at Hanworth I make up my Tusculum.”\r\nMany a peaceful evening must they have passed upon the terraces,\r\nwithin sound of the solemn songs always dear to both. Visitors yet\r\nmore illustrious came there from the city; for the noble hostess\r\nhad once the privilege of reviving the great Lord Bacon,[10] who\r\nhad fainted in her garden. We learn, with sympathy, that “sickness,\r\nin the declination of her years, had opened her to an overflowing\r\nof melancholy; not that she ever lay under that water, but yet had,\r\nsometimes, some high tides of it.” Death chose Dr. Donne’s ministering\r\nangel before him, after thirty years of mutual fealty. Her restless son\r\nEdward, now at home, was already eminent, and wearing his little Irish\r\ntitle of Baron Castleisland; her thoughtful Charles was long dead; her\r\nbrother, also, was no more; her daughters were matrons, and dwelling in\r\nprosperity. With but one unfulfilled wish, that of seeing her favorite\r\nGeorge married and in holy orders,[11] and after a life which left a\r\nwake of sunshine behind it in the world, very patiently and hopefully\r\nMagdalen Newport, Lady Danvers, entered upon eternity, in the early\r\nJune of 1627. On the eighth day of the month, in St. Luke’s, the parish\r\nchurch of Chelsea, she was buried:\r\n\r\n    “Old age with snow-bright hair, and folded palm,”\r\n\r\nthe final earthly glimpse of her still traditionally beautiful. On the\r\nfirst of July her faithful liegeman, now Dean of St. Paul’s and Vicar\r\nof St. Dunstan-in-the-West, preached her funeral sermon there, before\r\na crowd of the great ones of London, the clergy, and the poor. Izaak\r\nWalton’s kind face looked up from a near pew, whence he saw Dr. Donne’s\r\ntears, and felt his breaking voice, the voice of one who did not belie\r\nhis friend, nigh the end of his own pilgrimage. In present grief and\r\namong graver memories, he had the true perception not to forget how\r\njoyous she had been. “She died,” he said, “without any change of\r\ncountenance or posture, without any struggling, any disorder, . . . and\r\nexpected that which she hath received: God’s physic and God’s music,\r\na Christianly death. . . . She was eyes to the blind, and feet to the\r\nlame, . . . naturally cheerful and merry, and loving facetiousness and\r\nsharpness of wit.” His own fund of mirth and strength was fast going;\r\nand a haunting line of his youth,\r\n\r\n    “And all my pleasures are like yesterday,”\r\n\r\nmust have reverted to him many and many a time. Morbid and persistent\r\nthoughts beset him from this hour, probably, more than ever, until\r\nhe had the effigy of himself, painted as he was, laid in his failing\r\nsight;[12] morbid and persistent thoughts of the ruin which befalls the\r\nbright bodies of humanity, sometimes surging up in his loneliness, and\r\ncrowding out the better vision which yet may “grace us in the disgrace\r\nof death.” His inward eye was drawn strongly to his friend’s sepulchre,\r\nsealed and sombre before him, and to what had been her, “going into\r\ndust now almost a month of days, almost a lunar year . . . which, while\r\nI speak, is mouldering and crumbling into less and less dust.” But he\r\nended in a wholesomer strain, subdued and calm: “This good soul being\r\nthus laid down to sleep in His peace, ‘I charge you, O daughters of\r\nJerusalem, that ye wake her not!’”\r\n\r\nThe rare little duodecimo which contains Lady Danvers’s funeral sermon\r\nwas printed soon after, “together with other Commemorations of Her, by\r\nher Sonne G. Herbert,” and offered to the public at the Golden Lion in\r\nPaul’s Churchyard. The commemorations are in Greek and Latin. Strangely\r\nenough, nowhere is the sweet and sage poet of _The Temple_ so set upon\r\nhis prosody, so given to awkward pagan conceits, so out of tune with\r\nthe ideals of classic diction. But he, who tenderly loved his mother,\r\nhas given to us, in the _Memoriæ Matris Sacrum_, several precious\r\npersonal fragments, and one more precious whole picture of daily habits\r\nin the lines beginning _Corneliæ sanctæ_: her morning prayer, her bath,\r\nand the plaiting of her glossy hair; her housewifely cares, her fit\r\nreplies, her writing to her friends, her passion for music, her gentle\r\nhelpfulness; the long felicity of a glad and stainless life,\r\n\r\n    “Quicquid habet tellus, quicquid et astra, fruens.”\r\n\r\nDr. Donne died in 1631, whatever was yet of earth in his spirit healed\r\nand chastened by long pain. His last remembrance to some he loved\r\nwas his own seal of Christ on the Anchor, “engraven very small on\r\nheliotropium stones, and set in gold, for rings.” Many of those to\r\nwhom his heart would have turned, the “autumnal beauty” scarce second\r\namong them, had preceded him out of England. But in travelling towards\r\nhis Maker, he had that other sacred hope to “ebb on with them,” and\r\ngloriously overtake them, as he traced the epitaph which covered\r\nhim in old St. Paul’s: “_Hic licet in occiduo cinere, aspicit eum\r\ncujus nomen est Oriens_.” The tie between himself and her was not\r\nunremembered in the next generation; for we find John Donne the younger\r\ndedicating his father’s posthumous work to Francis, Lord Newport,\r\nand when making his will, in 1662, bequeathing also to the same Lord\r\nNewport “the picture of St. Anthony in a round frame.” And thus, in a\r\nrevived fragrance, the annals of true friendship close.\r\n\r\nThese rapid, ragged strokes of a pen make the only possible biography\r\nof Lady Danvers. When Walton wrote of her, he had the entire\r\ncorrespondence with Dr. Donne before him.[13] “There were sacred\r\nendearments betwixt these two excellent persons,” he assures us, but\r\ndisappointingly hurries on into the highway of his subject. It is\r\ncurious that it seems impossible now to trace these breathing relics,\r\nor others from the same source; for George Herbert, in the second\r\nelegy of the _Parentalia_, has much to say, and very sweetly, of the\r\nindustry of his mother’s “white right hand,” and of the “many and most\r\nnotable letters, flying over all the world.” Much detail is utterly\r\nlost which men who agree with Prosper Mérimée that all Thucydides\r\nwould not be worth an authentic memoir of Aspasia, or even of one of\r\nthe slaves of Pericles, might be glad to remember. A copy of a song,\r\na reminiscence of the glow and stir of the days through which she\r\nmoved, a guess through a mist at the blond head,[14] the half-imperious\r\ncarriage, the open hand, as she went her ways, like Dante’s lovely\r\nlady, _sentendosi laudare_,—these are all we have of the daughter of\r\nEngland’s golden age. It would be easy, were it also just, to throw\r\na dash of color into her shadowy history. One would like to verify\r\nthe scene at Eyton, while the news of the coming Armada roused the\r\nlion in Drake, and struck terror into the Devon towns; and to hear the\r\nyoung wife, with three lisping Herberts at her knee, beguile them with\r\nmellow contralto snatches of a Robin Hood ballad, or with the sweet\r\nyesterday’s tale of Zutphen, where their country’s dearest gave his\r\ncup of water to a dying comrade. A decade later, before their handsome\r\nbluff father, her other healthful boys stood up to wrestle, and twang\r\ntheir arrows at forty paces; or a rosy daughter stole to his side, and\r\nasked him of mishaps in Ireland, or of the giant laughter bubbling\r\nfrom the “oracle of Apollo” in a London street. It is to be believed\r\nthat one who watched events through the insurrection of Essex, through\r\nRaleigh’s dramatic trial, reprieve, and execution, through the national\r\nmourning for the Prince of Wales, through the fever for colonization,\r\nthe savage sea-fights, the great intrigues in behalf of the Queen of\r\nScots, the religious divisions, the muttering parliamentary thunders,\r\nthe stress and heat of the exciting dawn of the seventeenth century,\r\nwas not unmindful of all it meant to be alive, there and then. Magdalen\r\nNewport’s girlhood fell on Lyly’s _Euphues_, fresh from the printers;\r\nthe _Arcadia_ made the talk of Oxford, in her prime; the dusky splendor\r\nof Marlowe’s _Faustus_ was abroad before her second marriage. She was,\r\nsurely, aware of Shakespeare, and of the wonder-folio of 1623; of the\r\nnewest delighting madrigals and antiphons set forth by one Robert\r\nJones, when every soul in England had the gift of music; of rascal\r\nRobert Greene’s lovable lyrics, of Wyatt’s, Campion’s, and Drayton’s.\r\nShe wrote no verses, indeed, but her familiars wrote them; her every\r\nstep jostled a Muse. We may assume that no growth nor loss in literary\r\ncircles escaped that tender “perplexing eye.” Perhaps it glistened from\r\na bench, in the pioneer British theatre, on the actors of _Volpone_,\r\nand followed silently, behind the royal group, the first mincings\r\nof the first dear Fool in _King Lear_, one day-after-Christmas at\r\nWhitehall. Last of all, for whim’s sake, how any sociologist would\r\nenjoy having the honest opinion of young Lady Herbert, or that of\r\nlittle Mistress Donne, concerning the person they could but thank and\r\npraise! _Utinam vivisset Pepys!_ It is a cheat of history that it\r\npreserves no clearer tint or trace of this chosen passer-by. Such, in\r\ntruth, she was, and the quiet vanishing name clings to her: the woman\r\nof durable gladness, happily born and taught, like the soul whereof Sir\r\nHenry Wotton, who must have known her well, made his immortal song.\r\n\r\nOf the gracious figure of Sir John Danvers we may be said to lose\r\nsight; for he seems less gracious, as by a Hindoo trick, as soon as\r\nit is written that his wife departed unto her reward. Comment on\r\nhis character is equal comment upon hers, and adds new force to the\r\nclassic episode of a lady philanthropist espousing a ne’er-do-weel and\r\na featherbrain. Aubrey, always happy over a little ultra-contemporary\r\ngossip, calls it “a disagreeable match,” disappointing to the\r\nbridegroom’s kindred; but adds that “he married her for love of her\r\nwit.” Now, wit is an admirable magnet, but it is to be suspected that\r\nthere was also, and in the immediate vicinity, “metal more attractive,”\r\nas Hamlet says. In the Chelsea parish-books is an entry, the first of\r\nits kind, certifying that Sir John Danvers had settled his account with\r\n“the poore,” a matter of thirty pounds’ loan (in which the vicar must\r\nhave connived), for the year ending in January of 1628. If the payment\r\nwere, by any hap, in advance, it may have fallen in Lady Danvers’s own\r\nlifetime; and if so, it is quite as likely that she paid it, with an\r\nadmonition! Her “high tides of melancholy,” of whose true cause she\r\ncertainly would not have complained to Dr. Donne, had something to\r\ndo with this young spendthrift, who must have had his wheedling way,\r\nsooner or later, with such of her ample revenues as were yet extant.\r\nPerhaps Lord Herbert of Cherbury was both shrewd and charitable, in\r\nsuppressing mention of his new relative.[15] The longer one looks into\r\nthe matter, the less curious seems his unexplained silence concerning\r\nthis late graft of a family hitherto always respectable and always\r\nloyal.\r\n\r\nThere are gleams of subsequent private history in the tell-tale records\r\nat Chelsea. We are not incurably astonished to learn that as early as\r\nMay of 1629 was christened Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Danvers\r\nand Elizabeth his wife. This Lady Elizabeth, arriving providentially\r\nwith her Dauntsey wealth, having borne him four children, died, as\r\ndid his mother, in 1636; and left him even as she found him, none too\r\nmonogamous. In 1648 Sir John Danvers again appeared at the venerable\r\naltars where his first saint never had a memorial, loving, honoring,\r\nand cherishing a Mrs. Grace Hewes, Hawes, or Hewet, of Kemerton in\r\nGloucestershire, and, as it is to be surmised, leading her tame\r\nfortune by a ribbon. His debts and difficulties, not of one but of all\r\ntime, sprout perennially in the registers. His indefatigable name,\r\noftener than any rival’s whatsoever, figures as borrowing and paying\r\ninterest on a forty-pound note, which, like a Hydra-head, was always\r\nforthcoming so soon as it was demolished. This disgraceful business was\r\nthe man’s chief concern: for the older he grew the deeper and deeper\r\nhe sank into entanglements, particularly after the death of the King.\r\nIt was never doubted, in his day, but that this was a judgment on the\r\nformer Gentleman Usher who affixed hand and seal to the warrant of his\r\nsovereign’s execution.[16] His own family, it is said, as well as the\r\nroyalist Herberts and Newports, dropped his acquaintance; and who knows\r\nwhether Mrs. Grace Hewet was faithful? At his favorite Chelsea, in the\r\nApril of 1655, and in about the seventy-fourth year of his age, Sir\r\nJohn Danvers ended his career by more conventional agencies than the\r\nrope and the knife, which might have befallen him in the Stuart triumph\r\nof the morrow. His manor fell an immediate forfeit to the crown. In\r\n1661, the dead republican was attainted, and all of his estate which\r\nwas unprotected was declared regal booty. The year before his own\r\nburial at Dauntsey he laid there, “to the great grief of all good men,”\r\nthe body of his elder son Henry, who had just attained his majority.\r\nThe Earl of Danby had died, “full of honors, wounds, and days,” in\r\n1643, while this Henry, his nephew, was still a hopeful child; and on\r\nhim alone he had taken pains to settle his possessions. But Henry, in\r\nturn, was persuaded to bequeath the major part of them to his father’s\r\never-gaping pocket, the remainder reverting to one of his two surviving\r\nsisters. The third Lady Danvers, who lived until 1678, had also a son\r\nCharles,[17] who petitioned the crown for his paternal rights, but\r\ndied in old age, with neither income nor issue.\r\n\r\nClarendon quietly indicts Sir John Danvers as a “proud, formal, weak\r\nman,” such as Cromwell “employed and contemned at once.” George Bate\r\ngives him a harder character, saying that he “proved his brother to be\r\na delinquent in the Rump Parliament, whereby he might overthrow his\r\nwill, and so compass the estate himself. He sided with the sectarian\r\nparty, was one of the King’s judges, and lived afterwards some years\r\nin his sin, without repentance.” But the same accuser adds the saving\r\nfact that Dr. Thomas Fuller, like Aubrey, was Sir John’s friend, and,\r\nby his desire, preached many times at Chelsea, “where, I am sure, he\r\nwas instructed to repent of his misguided and wicked consultations in\r\nhaving to do with the murther of that just man.” One half surmises\r\nthat had the preliminaries of the great struggle occurred in her time\r\nMagdalen Herbert’s rather austere and advanced standards of right would\r\nhave stood it out, despite her traditions, for the Commons against\r\n_Carolus Agnus_.[18] But that would have been a very different matter\r\nfrom sharing the feelings of the crude advocates of revolution and\r\nregicide. What a misconception of her spotless motives must she have\r\nborne, had others found her in agreement with her vagabond lord, who\r\ntreated politics as he treated the sacrament of matrimony, purely as a\r\nmakeshift and a speculation!\r\n\r\nHe was no raw-head-and-bloody-bones, this Roderigo-like Briton who won\r\nthe approval of Lord Bacon, and whom George Wither thanks for “those\r\npleasurable refreshments often vouchsafed”; and whom very different\r\nmen, such as George Herbert and Walton[19] and peaceable Fuller loved.\r\nHe was a comely creature of some parts, a luckless worldling anxious\r\nto feather his own nest, and driven by timidity and the desire of gain\r\ninto treacheries against himself. His short, thin, and “fayre bodie,”\r\ncommon, as George Herbert would have us imply, to all who bore his\r\nname, his elegance, his hospitality, and his devotedness to his elderly\r\nwife, carried him off handsomely in the eyes of her jealous circle. His\r\nhouse in Chelsea, commemorated now by Danvers Street, adjoined that\r\nwhich had been Sir Thomas More’s, and was presumably a part of the same\r\nestate. All around it, and due to its master’s genuine enthusiasm, lay\r\nthe first Italian garden planted in England; and there, rolling towards\r\nthe Thames, were the long glowing flower-beds and green orchard-alleys,\r\nwhich were also the “_horti deliciæ dominæ_” recalled thrice in the\r\nmusic of filial sorrow. This home of Magdalen Danvers was pulled down,\r\nand built over, in 1716. Within its unfallen walls, where she spent\r\nher serene married life, and where she died, she had time to think,\r\nnevertheless, that she stood, towards evening, in the ways of folly,\r\nand that hers was one of those little incipient domestic tragedies\r\nwhich must always look amusing, even to a friend.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Walton confuses this Edward Herbert with a namesake entered at\r\nQueen’s College; and he follows the erring dates of the _Autobiography\r\nof Lord Herbert of Cherbury_. The boy’s age is correctly given as\r\nfourteen in the college registers.\r\n\r\n[2] Donne had been in residence at both Universities, but took no\r\ndegree at either, as he had scruples against accepting the conditions\r\nimposed. He was at that time, and until about 1593, like his parents, a\r\nCatholic. His father was of Welsh descent: a fact which may have borne\r\nits share in attracting him towards the Herberts.\r\n\r\n[3] Anne Donne, it may be remarked, was also the name of Cowper’s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n[4] Sir Richard Baker’s _Chronicle_, 1684, mentions Dr. Donne as one\r\nof his “heroic Grecians,” and adds, in the same breath, that he was “a\r\ngreat visitor of ladies.”\r\n\r\n[5] Dr. Donne’s conceit about the ages of his friends is better handled\r\nin the young Cartwright’s\r\n\r\n“Chloe, why wish you that your years,”\r\n\r\na little later. It is not impossible that Cartwright, an Oxonian and an\r\nobserver, may have drawn upon Donne’s report of this very wedding for\r\nhis charming and ingenious lyric.\r\n\r\n[6] This august personage was one of the Spencers of Althorp. At\r\nthis time she had been for six years the wife of her second husband,\r\nthe Lord Keeper Egerton, although retaining the magnificent title of\r\nher widowhood. At their estate of Harefield in Middlesex, Milton’s\r\n_Arcades_ was afterwards given, and it will be remembered what fine\r\ncompliments to the then aged countess-dowager figure in its opening\r\nverses. Spenser’s _Teares of the Muses_ had been dedicated to her, in\r\nher prime, and she was the Amaryllis “highest in degree” of his _Colin\r\nClout’s Come Home Again_.\r\n\r\n[7] Sir James Sandelyn, Sandalo, or Sandilands (who cuts his finest\r\nfigure as Jacobus Sandilandius in _The Muses’ Welcome_) was appointed\r\nMaistre d’Hostel to the beloved and beautiful Princess Elizabeth on\r\nher marriage to Frederic, Count Palatine of the Rhine, afterwards\r\nKing of Bohemia, in 1612. As Sir James’s name is down on the lists of\r\nthe Exchequer for a gift in 1615, and as his little son Richard was\r\nbaptized in Deptford Church two months after the date of Lady Danvers’s\r\nletter, we may conclude that he came back to England just when the\r\n“ambassatore” expected him.\r\n\r\n[8] Edward Herbert served as a volunteer in the campaign of 1614-15\r\nin the Netherlands, under the Prince of Orange. Richard Herbert, here\r\nmentioned, was his eldest son, a future Cavalier and captain of a troop\r\nof horse in the Civil Wars; Edward was the baby, and “Bettye” the child\r\nBeatrice, destined, like her sister, to a short life.\r\n\r\n[9] This 1614-15 was an eccentric and un-English year throughout. The\r\nwinter signalized itself by the Great Snow; “_frigus intensum_,” as\r\nCamden says, “_et nix copiosissima_.”\r\n\r\n[10] Lord Bacon dedicated to Edward Herbert, “the father of English\r\ndeists,” his very flat translation of the Psalms! George wrote three\r\nLatin poems in his honor, one being upon the occasion of his death.\r\n\r\n[11] He was, in July of 1626, ordained deacon, and prebendary of Layton\r\nEcclesia in Huntingdonshire. Readers of Walton will remember how his\r\ndear mother invited him to commit simony on that occasion.\r\n\r\n[12] The standing marble figure in a winding-sheet which Dr. King had\r\nmodelled upon this strange painting on wood, may yet be seen in the\r\nsouth ambulatory of the choir of St. Paul’s; almost the only relic\r\nsaved from the old cathedral which perished in the Great Fire of 1666.\r\nIt is not only of unique interest, but of considerable artistic beauty,\r\nand “seems to breathe faintly,” as Sir Henry Wotton said of it.\r\n\r\n[13] Dr. Donne’s papers were bequeathed to Dr. Henry King, the\r\npoet-Bishop of Chichester, then residentiary of St. Paul’s. The “find”\r\nwere a precious one, if they yet survive.\r\n\r\n[14] The half-romantic reference, which occurs more than once in\r\nDonne’s poems, to his own long-dead arm which still shall keep\r\n\r\n“The bracelet of bright hair about the bone,”—\r\n\r\nhas it nothing to do with this blond head? _Honi soit qui mal y pense._\r\nThe internal evidences in _The Relic_, with its mention of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, and its boast of purest friendship, and the roguery of the\r\nclosing line in _The Funeral_, are somewhat strong, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n[15] The famous _Autobiography_, indeed, boldly assures posterity\r\nthat Lady Herbert, after 1597, “continued unmarried,” and, in brief,\r\n“was the woman Dr. Donne hath described her.” The acknowledgment of\r\nthe accuracy of that funeral sermon, containing, as it does, its very\r\nspecific Danvers passages, is in our fearless philosopher’s best style.\r\n\r\n[16] There was afterwards, in France, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber who\r\nhad other notions. “Gratitude,” said Thierry to his executioner in the\r\ncourt-yard of the Abbaye—“gratitude has no opinions. I am leal to my\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n[17] An elder Charles, son of the Lady Elizabeth Danvers, was baptized\r\nin 1632, and must have died early.\r\n\r\n[18] Edward Herbert sided eventually with the Parliament, which\r\nindemnified him for the burning and sacking of Montgomery Castle.\r\n\r\n[19] The six very innocent, cheerful, pious ten-syllable stanzas,\r\nattributed in _The Complete Angler_ to “another angler, Jo. Davors,\r\nEsq.,” are not, it is hardly necessary to add, from our scapegrace’s\r\npen. He ceased to be “Jo. Davors, Esq.,” when Walton was fourteen years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHENRY VAUGHAN\r\n\r\n1621-1695\r\n\r\n\r\nIN his own person, Henry Vaughan left no trace in society. His life\r\nseemed to slip by like the running water on which he was forever gazing\r\nand moralizing, and his memory met early with the fate which he hardly\r\nforesaw. Descended from the royal chiefs of southern Wales whom Tacitus\r\nmentions, and whose abode, in the day of Roman domination, was in the\r\ndistrict called Siluria,[20] he called himself the Silurist upon his\r\ntitle-pages; and he keeps the distinctive name in the humblest of\r\nepitaphs, close by his home in the glorious valley of the Usk and the\r\nlittle Honddu, under the shadow of Tretower, the ruined castle of his\r\nrace, and of Pen-y-Fan and his kindred peaks. What we know of him\r\nis a sort of pastoral: how he was born, the son of a poor gentleman,\r\nin 1621, at Newton St. Bridget, in the old house yet asleep on the\r\nroad between Brecon and Crickhowel; how he went up to Oxford, Laud’s\r\nOxford, with Thomas, his twin, as a boy of sixteen, to be entered at\r\nJesus College;[21] how he took his degree (just where and when no one\r\ncan discover), and came back, after a London revel, to be the village\r\nphysician, though he was meant for the law, in what had become his\r\nbrother’s parish of Llansantffraed; to write books full of sequestered\r\nbeauty, to watch the most tragic of wars, to look into the faces of\r\nlove and loss, and to spend his thoughtful age on the bowery banks of\r\nthe river he had always known, his _Isca parens florum_, to which\r\nhe consecrated many a sweet English line. And the ripple of the not\r\nunthankful Usk was “distinctly audible over its pebbles,” as was the\r\nTweed to the failing sense of Sir Walter, in the room where Henry\r\nVaughan drew his last breath, on St. George’s day, April 23, 1695. He\r\ndied exactly seventy-nine years after Shakespeare, exactly one hundred\r\nand fifty-five years before Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nCircumstances had their way with him, as with most poets. He knew\r\nthe touch of disappointment and renunciation, not only in life, but\r\nin his civic hopes and in his art. He broke his career in twain, and\r\nbegan over, before he had passed thirty; and he showed great æsthetic\r\ndiscretion, as well as disinterestedness, in replacing his graceful\r\nearly verses by the deep dedications of his prime. Religious faith and\r\nmeditation seem so much part of his innermost nature, it is a little\r\ndifficult to remember that Vaughan considered himself a brand snatched\r\nfrom the burning, a lawless Cavalier brought by the best of chances\r\nto the quiet life, and the feet of the moral Muse. He suffered most\r\nof the time between 1643 and 1651 from a sorely protracted and nearly\r\nfatal illness; and during its progress his wife and his dearest friends\r\nwere taken from him. Nor was the execution of the King a light event\r\nto so sensitive a poet and so passionate a partisan. Meanwhile Vaughan\r\nread George Herbert, and his theory of proportional values began to\r\nchange. It was a season of transition and silent crises, when men bared\r\ntheir breasts to great issues, and when it was easy for a childlike\r\nsoul,\r\n\r\n    “Weary of her vain search below, above,\r\n     In the first Fair to find the immortal Love.”[22]\r\n\r\nVaughan, in his new fervor, did his best to suppress the numbers\r\nwritten in his youth, thus clearing the field for what he afterwards\r\ncalled his “hagiography”; and a critic may wonder what he found in his\r\nfirst tiny volume of 1646, or in _Olor Iscanus_, to regret or cancel.\r\nEvery unbaptized song is “bright only in its own innocence, and\r\nkindles nothing but a generous thought”; and one of them, at least,\r\nhas a manly postlude of love and resolve worthy of the free lyres of\r\nLovelace and Montrose. Vaughan, unlike other ardent spirits of his\r\nclass, had nothing very gross to be sorry for; if he was, indeed, one\r\nof his own\r\n\r\n              “feverish souls,\r\n    Sick with a scarf or glove,”\r\n\r\nhe had none but noble ravings. Happily, his very last verses, _Thalia\r\nRediviva_, breaking as it were by accident a silence of twenty-three\r\nyears, indorse with cheerful gallantry the accents of his youth.\r\nThe turn in his life which brought him lasting peace, in a world\r\nrocking between the cant of the Parliament and resurgent audacity\r\nand riot, achieved for us a body of work which, small as it is, has\r\nrare interest, and an out-of-door beauty, as of the natural dusk,\r\n“breathless with adoration,” which is almost without parallel. Eternity\r\nhas been known to spoil a poet for time, but not in this instance.\r\nNever did religion and art interchange a more fortunate service,\r\noutside Italian studios. Once he had shaken off secular ambitions,\r\nVaughan’s voice grew at once freer and more forceful. In him a\r\nmarked intellectual gain sprang from an apparently slight spiritual\r\nreadjustment, even as it did, three centuries later, in one greater\r\nthan he, John Henry Newman.\r\n\r\nVaughan’s work is thickly sown with personalities, but they are so\r\ndelicate and involved that there is little profit in detaching them.\r\nWhat record he made at the University is not apparent; nor is it at\r\nall sure that so independent and speculative a mind applied itself\r\ngracefully to the curriculum. He was, in the only liberal sense, a\r\nlearned man, full of life-long curiosity for the fruit of the Eden\r\nTree. His lines beginning\r\n\r\n    “Quite spent with thought I left my cell”\r\n\r\nshow the acutest thirst for hidden knowledge; he would “most gladly\r\ndie,” if death might buy him intellectual growth. He looks forward to\r\neternity as to the unsealing and disclosing of mysteries. He makes the\r\nsoul sing joyously to the body:\r\n\r\n    “I that here saw darkly, in a glass,\r\n       But mists and shadows pass,\r\n     And by their own weak shine did search the springs\r\n       And source of things,\r\n     Shall, with inlighted rays,\r\n       Pierce all their ways!”\r\n\r\nWith an imperious query, he encounters the host of midnight stars:\r\n\r\n                  “Who circled in\r\n    Corruption with this glorious ring?”\r\n\r\nWhat Vaughan does know is nothing to him; when he salutes the Bodleian\r\nfrom his heart, he is thinking how little honey he has gathered from\r\nthat vast hive, and how little it contains, when measured with what\r\nthere is to learn from living and dying. He had small respect for the\r\nsinister sciences among which the studies of his beloved brother,\r\na Neo-Platonist, lay. Though he was no pedant, he dearly loved to\r\nget in a slap against the ignorant whom we have always with us. At\r\ntwenty-five, he printed a good adaptation of the Tenth of Juvenal, and\r\nflourished his wit, in the preface, at the expense of some possible\r\ngentle reader of the parliamentary persuasion who would “quarrel with\r\nantiquitie.” “These, indeed, may think that they have slept out so many\r\ncenturies in this Satire, and are now awaked; which had it been still\r\nLatin, perhaps their nap had been everlasting!”\r\n\r\nHe was an optimist, proven through much personal trial; he had\r\nsympathy with the lower animals, and preserved a humorous deference\r\ntowards all things alive, even the leviathan of Holy Writ, which\r\nhe affectionately exalts into “the shipmen’s fear” and “the comely\r\nspacious whale”! Vaughan adored his friends; he had a unique veneration\r\nfor childhood; his adjective for the admirable and beautiful, whether\r\nmaterial or immaterial, is “dear”; and his mind dwelt with habitual\r\nfondness on what Sir Thomas Browne (a man after his own heart) calls\r\n“incomprehensibles, and thoughts of things which thoughts do but\r\ntenderly touch.”\r\n\r\nHis occupation as a resident physician must have fostered his fine\r\neye and ear for the green earth, and furnished him, day by day,\r\nwith musings in sylvan solitudes, and rides abroad over the fresh\r\nhill-paths. The breath of the mountains is about his books. An early\r\nriser, he uttered a constant invocation to whomever would listen, that\r\n\r\n                    “Manna was not good\r\n    After sun-rising; far-day sullies flowers.”\r\n\r\nHe was hospitable on a limited income.[23] His verses of invitation\r\n_To his Retired Friend_, which are not without their thrusts at\r\npassing events, have a classic jollity fit to remind the reader of\r\nRandolph’s ringing ode to Master Anthony Stafford. Again and again\r\nVaughan reiterates the Socratic and Horatian song of content: that he\r\nhas enough lands and money, that there are a thousand things he does\r\nnot want, that he is blessed in what he has. All this does not prevent\r\nhim from recording the phenomenal ebb-tides of his purse, and from\r\nwhimsically synthesizing on “the threadbare, goldless genealogie” of\r\nbards! No sour zealot in anything, he enjoyed an evening now and then\r\nat the Globe Tavern in London, where he consumed his sack with relish,\r\nthat he might be “possessor of more soul,” and “after full cups have\r\ndreams poetical.” But he was no lover of the town. Country life was\r\nhis joy and pride; the only thing which seemed, in his own most vivid\r\nphrase, to “fill his breast with home.”\r\n\r\n    “Here something still like Eden looks!\r\n     Honey in woods, juleps in brooks.”\r\n\r\nA literary acquaintance, one unrecognized N. W., congratulates\r\nVaughan that he is able to “give his Muse the swing in an hereditary\r\nshade.” He translated with great gusto _The Old Man of Verona_, out\r\nof Claudian, and Guevara’s _Happiness of Country Life_; and he notes\r\nwith satisfaction that Abraham was of his rural mind, in “Mamre’s holy\r\ngrove.” Vaughan was an angler, need it be added? Nay, the autocrat of\r\nanglers: he was a salmon-catcher.\r\n\r\nWith “the charity which thinketh no evil,” he loved almost everything,\r\nexcept the Jesuits, and his ogres the Puritans. For Vaughan knew where\r\nhe stood, and his opinion of Puritanism never varied. He kept his\r\nsnarls and satires, for the most part, hedged within his prose, the\r\nproper ground of the animosities. When he put on his singing-robes, he\r\ntried to forget, not always with success, his spites and bigotries.\r\nFor his life, he could not help sidelong glances, stings, strictures\r\nbetween his teeth, thistle-down hints cast abroad in the neatest of\r\ngeneralities:\r\n\r\n    “Who saint themselves, they are no saints!”\r\n\r\nThe introduction to his _Mount of Olives_ (whose pages have a soft\r\nbillowy music like Jeremy Taylor’s) is nominally inscribed to “the\r\npeaceful, humble, and pious reader.” That functionary must have found\r\nit a trial to preserve his peaceful and pious abstraction, while the\r\npeaceful and pious author proceeded to flout the existing government,\r\nin a towering rage, and in very elegant caustic English. Vaughan was\r\nnone too godly to be a thorough hater. He was genially disposed to\r\nthe pretensions of every human creature; he refused to consider his\r\nancestry and nurture by themselves, as any guarantee of the justice\r\nof his views or of his superior insight into affairs. Yet in spite of\r\nhis enforced Quaker attitude during the clash of arms, he nursed in\r\nthat gentle bosom the heartiest loathing of democracy, and shared the\r\ntastes of a certain clerk of the Temple “who never could be brought to\r\nwrite Oliver with a great O.” It is fortunate that he did not spoil\r\nhimself, as Wither did, upon the wheels of party, for politics were his\r\nmost vehement concern. Had he been richer, as he tells us in a playful\r\npassage, nothing on earth would have kept him from meddling with\r\nnational issues.\r\n\r\nThe poets, save the greatest, Milton, his friend Andrew Marvell, and\r\nWither, rallied in a bright group under the royal standard. Those\r\namong them who did not fight were commonly supposed, as was Drummond\r\nof Hawthornden, to redeem their reputation by dying of grief at the\r\noverthrow of the King. Yet Vaughan did not fight, and Vaughan did not\r\ndie of grief. It is so sure that he suffered some privation, and it\r\nmay be imprisonment, for his allegiance, that shrewd guessers, before\r\nnow, have equipped him and placed him in the ranks of the losing cause,\r\nwhere he might have had choice company. His generous erratic brother (a\r\nwriter of some note, an alchemist, an Orientalist, a Rosicrucian, who\r\nwas ejected from his vicarage in 1654, and died either of the plague,\r\nor of inhaling the fumes of a caldron, at Albury, in 1665, while the\r\ncourt was at Oxford)[24] had been a recruit, and a brave one. But Henry\r\nVaughan explicitly tells us, in his _Ad Posteros_, and in a prayer in\r\nthe second part of _Silex Scintillans_, that he had no personal share\r\nin the constitutional struggle, that he shed no blood. Again he cries,\r\nin a third lyric,\r\n\r\n                              “O accept\r\n    Of his vowed heart, whom Thou hast kept\r\n    From bloody men!”\r\n\r\nThis painstaking record of a fact by one so loyal as he goes far\r\nto prove, to an inductive mind not thoroughly familiar with his\r\ncircumstances, that he considered war the worst of current evils, and\r\nwas willing, for this first principle of his philosophy, to lay himself\r\nopen to the charge, not indeed of cowardice (was he not a Vaughan?),\r\nbut of lack of appreciation for the one romantic opportunity of his\r\nlife. His withdrawal from the turmoil which so became his colleagues\r\nmay seem to harmonize with his known moral courage and right sentiment;\r\nand fancy is ready to fasten on him the sad neutrality, and the\r\npassionate “ingemination” for “peace, peace,” which “took his sleep\r\nfrom him, and would shortly break his heart,” such as Clarendon tells\r\nus of in his beautiful passage touching the young Lord Falkland. But\r\nit is greatly to be feared that Vaughan, despite all the abstract\r\nreasoning which arrays itself against so babyish and barbarous a thing\r\nas a battle, would have swung himself into a saddle as readily as any,\r\nhad not “God’s finger touched him.” A comparison of dates will show\r\nthat he was bedridden, while his hot heart was afield with the shouting\r\ngentlemen whom Mr. Browning heard in a vision:\r\n\r\n    “King Charles! and who’ll do him right, now?\r\n     King Charles! and who’s ripe for fight, now?\r\n     Give a rouse: here’s in Hell’s despite now,\r\n                  King Charles!”\r\n\r\nThis is the secret of Vaughan’s blood-guiltlessness. Of course he\r\nthanked Heaven, after, that he was kept clean of carnage; he would have\r\nthanked Heaven for anything that happened to him. It was providential\r\nthat we of posterity lost a soldier in the Silurist, and gained a poet.\r\nAs the great confusion cleared, his spirit cleared too, and the Vaughan\r\nwe know,\r\n\r\n    “Delicious, lusty, amiable, fair,”\r\n\r\ncomes in, like a protesting angel, with the Commonwealth. Perhaps\r\nhe lived long enough to sum up the vanity of statecraft and the\r\ninstability of public choice, driven from tyranny to license, from\r\nabsolute monarchy to absolute anarchy; and to turn once more to his\r\n“loud brook’s incessant fall” as an object much worthier of a rational\r\nman’s regard. Born while James I. was vain-gloriously reigning, Henry\r\nVaughan survived the Civil War, the two Protectorates, the orgies of\r\nthe Restoration (which he did not fail to satirize), and the Revolution\r\nof “Meenie the daughter,” as the old Scots song slyly calls her. He had\r\nseen the Stuarts in and out, in and out again, and his seventy-four\r\nyears, on-lookers at a tragedy, were not forced to sit through the dull\r\nGeorgian farce which began almost as soon as his grave was green.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was thoroughly out of touch with his surroundings. While\r\nall the world was either devil-may-care or Calvin-colored, he had for\r\nhis characteristic a rapt, inexhaustible joy, buoying him up and\r\nsweeping him away. He might well have said, like Dr. Henry More, his\r\ntwin’s rival and challenger in metaphysics, that he was “most of his\r\ntime mad with pleasure.” While\r\n\r\n                  “every burgess foots\r\n    The mortal pavement in eternal boots,”\r\n\r\nVaughan lay indolently along a bank, like a shepherd swain, pondering\r\nupon the brood of “green-heads” who denied miracles to have been or to\r\nbe, and wishing the noisy passengers on the highways of life could be\r\ntaught the value of\r\n\r\n    “A sweet self-privacy in a right soul.”\r\n\r\nHis mind turned to paradoxes and inverted meanings, and the analysis\r\nof his own tenacious dreams, in an England of pikes and bludgeons and\r\nhock-carts and wassail-cakes. “A proud, humoursome person,” Anthony\r\nà Wood called him. He was something of a fatalist, inasmuch as he\r\nfollowed his lonely and straight path, away from crowds, and felt eager\r\nfor nothing but what fell into his open hands. He strove little, being\r\nconvinced that temporal advantage is too often an eternal handicap.\r\n“Who breaks his glass to take more light,” he reminds us, “makes way\r\nfor storms unto his rest.” This passive quality belongs to happy men,\r\nand Vaughan was a very happy man, thanks to the faith and will which\r\nmade him so, although he had known calamity, and had failed in much.\r\nThroughout his pages one can trace the affecting struggle between\r\nthings desired and things forborne. It is only a brave philosopher who\r\ncan afford to pen a stanza intimate as this:\r\n\r\n    “O Thou who didst deny to me\r\n     The world’s adored felicity!\r\n     Keep still my weak eyes from the shine\r\n     Of those gay things which are not Thine.”\r\n\r\nHe had better possessions than glory under his hand in the health and\r\npeace of his middle age and in his cheerful home. He was twice married,\r\nand must have lost his first wife, nameless to us, but most tenderly\r\nmourned, in his twenty-ninth or thirtieth year. She seems to have been\r\nthe mother of five of his six children. Vaughan was rich in friends. He\r\nhad known Davenant and Cartwright, but it is quite characteristic of\r\nhim that the two great authors to whom he was especially attached were\r\nJonson and John Fletcher, both only a memory at the time of his first\r\ngoing to London. Of Randolph, Jonson’s strong “son,” who so beggared\r\nEnglish literature by dying young in 1634, Vaughan sweetly says\r\nsomewhere that he will hereafter\r\n\r\n    “Look for Randolph in those holy meads.”\r\n\r\nMention of his actual fellow-workers is very infrequent, nor does he\r\nmention the Shakespeare who had “dwelt on earth unguessed at,” and who\r\nis believed to have visited the estates of the Vaughans at Scethrog,\r\nand to have picked up the name of his merry fellow Puck from goblin\r\ntraditions of the neighborhood. Vaughan followed his leisure and his\r\npreference in translating divers works of meditation, biography, and\r\nmedicine, pleasing himself, like Queen Bess, with naturalizing bits of\r\nBoethius, and much from Plutarch, Ausonius, Severinus, and Claudian.\r\nHe did some passages from Ovid, but he must have felt sharply the\r\nviolence done to the lyric essence in passing it ever so gently from\r\nlanguage to language, for he lingered over Adrian’s darling _Animula\r\nvagula blandula_, only to leave it alone, and to write of it as the\r\nsaddest poetry that ever he met with.\r\n\r\nNot the least of Henry Vaughan’s blessings was his warm friendship with\r\n“the matchless Orinda.”[25] This delightful Catherine Fowler married,\r\nin 1647, a stanch royalist, Mr. James Philips of Cardigan Priory, and\r\nas his bride, became what, in the Welsh solitudes, was considered\r\n“neighbor” to Vaughan, her home being distant from his just fifty miles\r\nas the crow flies. She had been, in her infancy, a prodigy of Biblical\r\nquotation, like Evelyn’s little Richard, and grew up to be such another\r\n_précieuse_ as Madame la Comtesse de Lafayette, _née_ Lavergne; but\r\nwe know that she was the cleverest and comeliest of good women, and\r\nVaughan’s association with her must have been a perpetual sunshine\r\nto him and his. She prefixed, after the fashion of the day, some\r\ncommendatory verses to his published work. They are not only pretty,\r\nbut they furnish a bit of adequate criticism. The secular Muse of the\r\nSilurist is, according to Orinda,\r\n\r\n    “Truth clothed in wit, and Love in innocence,”\r\n\r\nand has, for her birthright, seriousness and a “charming rigour.” The\r\nlast two words might stand for him in the fast-coming day when nobody\r\nwill have time to discuss old poets in anything but technical terms and\r\nepigrams. Orinda, with her accurate judgment, should have had a chance\r\nto talk to Mr. Thomas Campbell, who adorned his _Specimens_ with the\r\none official and truly prepositional phrase that “Vaughan was one of\r\nthe harshest of writers, even of the inferior order of the school of\r\nconceit!”[26]\r\n\r\nWhile Henry Vaughan was preparing for publication the first half of\r\n_Silex Scintillans_ as the token of his arrested and uplifted youth,\r\nRev. Mr. Thomas Vaughan, backed by a few other sanguine Oxonians, and\r\ndisregardful of his twin’s exaggerated remorse for the fruits of his\r\nprofaner years, brought out the “formerly written and newly named”\r\n_Olor Iscanus_, over the author’s head, in 1650, and gave to it a\r\nmotto from the Georgics. The preface is in Eugenius Philalethes’ own\r\ngallant style, and offers a haughty commendation to “beauty from the\r\nlight retired.” Perhaps Vaughan’s earliest and most partial editor\r\nfelt, like Thoreau on a certain occasion, that it were well to make an\r\nextreme statement, if only so he might make an emphatic one. He chose\r\nto supplicate the public of the Protectorate in this wise: “It was\r\nthe glorious Maro that referred his legacies to the fire, and though\r\nprinces are seldom executors, yet there came a Cæsar to his testament,\r\nas if the act of a poet could not be repealed but by a king. I am\r\nnot, reader, Augustus Vindex: here is no royal rescue, but here is a\r\nMuse that deserves it. The author had long ago condemned these poems\r\nto obscurity and the consumption of that further fate which attends\r\nit. This censure gave them a gust of death, and they have partly known\r\nthat oblivion which our best labors must come to at last. I present\r\nthee, then, not only with a book, but with a prey, and, in this kind,\r\nthe first recoveries from corruption. Here is a flame hath been some\r\ntime extinguished, thoughts that have been lost and forgot, but now\r\nthey break out again like the Platonic reminiscency. I have not the\r\nauthor’s approbation to the fact, but I have law on my side, though\r\nnever a sword: I hold it no man’s prerogative to fire his own house.\r\nThou seest how saucy I am grown, and if thou dost expect I should\r\ncommend what is published, I must tell thee I cry no Seville oranges;\r\nI will not say ‘Here is fine,’ or ‘cheap’: that were an injury to\r\nthe verse itself, and to the effect it can produce. Read on; and\r\nthou wilt find thy spirit engaged, not by the deserts of what we call\r\ntolerable, but by the commands of a pen that is above it.” All this is\r\nuncritical, but useful and proper on the part of the clerical brother,\r\nwho writes very much as Lord Edward Herbert might be supposed to write\r\nfor George under like conditions; for he knew, according to an ancient\r\nadage, that there is great folly in pointing out the shortcomings of\r\na work of art to eyes uneducated to its beauties. It was just as well\r\nto insist disproportionately upon the principle at stake, that Henry\r\nVaughan’s least book was unique and precious. He was not, like the\r\nmajority of the happy lyrists of his time, a writer by accident; he\r\nwas strictly a man of letters, and his sign-manual is large and plain\r\nupon everything which bears his name. He indites like a Roman, with\r\nevenness and without a superfluous syllable. One cannot italicize\r\nhim; every word is a congested force, packed to bursting with meaning\r\nand insistence; the utterance of a man who has been thinking all his\r\nlife upon his own chosen subjects, and who unerringly despatches\r\na language about its business, as if he had just created it. Like\r\nAndrew Marvell’s excellent father, “he never broached what he had\r\nnever brewed.” It follows that his work, to which second editions were\r\nwellnigh unknown, shows scarcely any variation from itself. It carries\r\nwith it a testimony that, such as it stands, it is the very best its\r\nauthor can do. Its faults are not slips; they are quite as radical and\r\ncongenital as its virtues. Vaughan (to transfer a fine phrase of Mr.\r\nW. T. Arnold) is “enamoured of perfection,” but he is fully so before\r\nhe makes up his mind to write, and from the first every stroke of his\r\npen is fatal. It transfixes a noun or a verb, pins it to the page, and\r\nchallenges a reformer to move or replace it. His modest Muse is as\r\nsure as Shakespeare, as nice as Pope; she is incapable of scruples and\r\napprehensions, once she has spoken. What Vaughan says of Cartwright may\r\nwell be applied to his own deliberate grace of diction:\r\n\r\n    “Thou thy thoughts hast drest in such a strain\r\n     As doth not only speak, but rule and reign.”\r\n\r\nHis verses have the tone of a Vandyck portrait, with all its firm\r\npensive elegance and lack of shadow.\r\n\r\nVaughan has very little quaintness, as we now understand that word, and\r\nnone of the cloudiness and incorrigible grotesqueness which dominated\r\nhis Alexandrian day. He has great temperance; he keeps his eye upon\r\nthe end, and scarcely falls at all into “the fond adulteries of art,”\r\ninversions, unscholarly compound words, or hard-driven metaphors. If\r\nhe be difficult to follow, it is only because he lives, as it were, in\r\nhighly oxygenated air; he is remote and peculiar, but not eccentric.\r\nHis conceits are not monstrous; the worst of them proclaims:\r\n\r\n      “Some love a rose\r\n    In hand, some in the skin;\r\n       But, cross to those,\r\n    I would have mine within”;\r\n\r\nwhich will bear a comparison with Carew’s hatched cherubim, or with\r\nthat very provincialism of Herbert’s which describes a rainbow as the\r\nlace of Peace’s coat! Those of Vaughan’s figures not drawn from the\r\nopen air, where he was happiest, are, indeed, too bold and too many,\r\nand they come from strange corners: from finance, medicine, mills, the\r\nnursery, and the mechanism of watches and clocks. In no one instance,\r\nhowever, does he start wrong, like the great influencer, Donne, in\r\n_The Valediction_, and finish by turning such impediments as “stiff\r\ntwin-compasses” into images of memorable beauty. The _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_, like Campbell, finds Vaughan “untunable,” and so he is\r\nvery often. But poets may not always succeed in metaphysics and in\r\nmusic too. The lute which has the clearest and most enticing twang\r\nunder the laurel boughs is Herrick’s, and not Donne’s; Mr. Swinburne’s,\r\nand not Mr. Browning’s. It is to be observed that when Vaughan lets go\r\nof his regrets, his advice, and his growls over the bad times, he falls\r\ninto instant melody, as if in that, and not in a rough impressiveness,\r\nwere his real strength. His blessing for the river Usk flows sweetly as\r\nthe tide it hangs upon:\r\n\r\n    “Garlands, and songs, and roundelays,\r\n     And dewy nights, and sunshine days,\r\n     The turtle’s voice, joy without fear,\r\n     Dwell on thy bosom all the year!\r\n     To thee the wind from far shall bring\r\n     The odors of the scattered spring,\r\n     And, loaden with the rich arrear,\r\n     Spend it in spicy whispers here.”\r\n\r\nVaughan played habitually with his pauses, and unconsciously threw the\r\nmetrical stress on syllables and words least able to bear it; but no\r\nsensitive ear can be otherwise than pleased at the broken sequence of\r\nsuch lines as\r\n\r\n        “these birds of light make a land glad\r\n    Chirping their solemn matins on a tree,”\r\n\r\nand the hesitant symbolism of\r\n\r\n    “As if his liquid loose retinue stayed\r\n     Lingering, and were of this steep place afraid.”\r\n\r\nThe word “perspective,” with the accent upon the first syllable, was\r\na favorite with him; and Wordsworth approved of that usage enough to\r\nemploy it in the majestic opening of the sonnet on King’s College\r\nChapel.[27] In short, if Vaughan be “untunable,” it is because he\r\nnever learned to distil vowels at the expense or peril of the message\r\nwhich he believed himself bound to deliver, even where hearers were\r\nnext to none, and which he tried only to make compact and clear. His\r\nspeech has a deep and free harmony of its own, to those whom abruptness\r\ndoes not repel; and even critics who turn from him to the masters of\r\nverbal sound may do him the parting honor of acknowledging the nature\r\nof his limitation.\r\n\r\n    “A noble error, and but seldom made,\r\n     When poets are by too much force betrayed!”\r\n\r\nVaughan was a born observer, and in his poetry may be found the pioneer\r\nexpression of the nineteenth-century feeling for landscape. His canvas\r\nis not often large; he had an indifference towards the exquisite\r\npresence of autumn, and an inland ignorance of the sea. But he could\r\nportray depth and distance at a stroke, as in the buoyant lines:\r\n\r\n    “It was high spring, and all the way\r\n     Primrosed, and hung with shade,”\r\n\r\nwhich etches for you the whole winding lane, roofed and floored with\r\nbeauty; he carries a reader over half a continent in his\r\n\r\n    “Paths that are hidden from the vulture’s eyes,”\r\n\r\nand suspends him above man’s planet altogether with his audacious\r\neagle, to whom “whole seas are narrow spectacles,” and who\r\n\r\n          “in the clear height and upmost air\r\n    Doth face the sun, and his dispersèd hair!”\r\n\r\nBesides this large vision, Vaughan had uncommon knowledge how to employ\r\ndetail, during the prolonged literary interval when it was wholly out\r\nof fashion. It has been the lot of the little rhymesters of all periods\r\nto deal with the open air in a general way, and to embellish their\r\npages with birds and boughs; but it takes a true modern poet, under the\r\ninfluence of the Romantic revival, to sum up perfectly the ravages of\r\nwind and frost:\r\n\r\n    “Where is the pride of summer, the green prime,\r\n      The many, many leaves all twinkling?—Three\r\n     On the mossed elm; three on the naked lime\r\n      Trembling; and one upon the old oak tree”;\r\n\r\nand it takes another to give the only faithful and ideal report of a\r\nwarbling which every schoolboy of the race had heard before him:\r\n\r\n    “That’s the wise thrush: he sings each song twice over,\r\n     Lest you should think he never could recapture\r\n     The first fine careless rapture.”\r\n\r\nThat Vaughan’s pages should furnish this patient specification is\r\nremarkable in a man whose mind was set upon things invisible. His gaze\r\nis upon the inaccessible ether, but he seems to detect everything\r\nbetween himself and heaven. He sighs over the inattentive rustic, whom,\r\nperhaps, he catches scowling by the pasture-bars of the wild Welsh\r\ndowns:\r\n\r\n                  “O that he would hear\r\n    The world read to him!”\r\n\r\nWhatever is in that pleasant world he himself hears and sees; and his\r\ninterrupted chronicle is always terse, graphic, straight from life. He\r\nhas the inevitable phrase for every phenomenon, a little low-comedy\r\nphrase, sometimes, such as Shakespeare and Carew had used before him:\r\n\r\n                        “Deep snow\r\n    Candies our country’s woody brow.”\r\n\r\nIt seems never to have entered the primitive mind of Vaughan to love,\r\nor serve, art and nature for themselves. His cue was to walk abroad\r\ncircumspectly and with incessant reverence, because in all things\r\nhe found God. He marks, at every few rods in the thickets, “those\r\nlow violets of Thine,” and the “breathing sacrifice” of earth-odors\r\nwhich the “parched and thirsty isle” gratefully sends back after a\r\nshower.[28] His prayer is that he may not forget that physical beauty\r\nis a great symbol, but only a symbol; a “hid ascent” through “masks and\r\nshadows” to the divine; or, as Mr. Lowell said in one of his last poems,\r\n\r\n                                  “a tent\r\n    Pitched for an Inmate far more excellent.”\r\n\r\nA humanist of the school of Assisi, Vaughan was full of out-of-door\r\nmeeknesses and pieties, nowhere sweeter in their expression than in\r\nthis all-embracing valedictory:\r\n\r\n    “O knowing, glorious Spirit! when\r\n     Thou shalt restore trees, beasts, and men,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Give him among Thy works a place\r\n     Who in them loved and sought Thy face.”\r\n\r\nHe muses in the garden, at evenfall:\r\n\r\n    “Man is such a marigold\r\n     As shuts, and hangs the head.”\r\n\r\nClouds, seasons, and the eternal stars are his playfellows; he\r\napostrophizes our sister the rainbow, and reminds her of yesterday, when\r\n\r\n    “Terah, Nahor, Haran, Abram, Lot,\r\n     The youthful world’s grey fathers, in one knot,”\r\n\r\nlifted anxious looks to her new splendor. He is familiar with the\r\ndepression which comes from boding weather, when\r\n\r\n            “a pilgrim’s eye,\r\n        Far from relief,\r\n    Measures the melancholy sky.”\r\n\r\nHe has an artist’s feeling, also, for the wrath of the elements, which\r\ninevitably hurry him on to the consummation\r\n\r\n    “When Thou shalt spend Thy sacred store\r\n      Of thunders in that heat,\r\n     And low as e’er they lay before\r\n      Thy six-days buildings beat!”\r\n\r\n“I saw,” he says, suddenly—\r\n\r\n    “I saw Eternity the other night”;\r\n\r\nand he is perpetually seeing things almost as startling and as bright:\r\nthe “edges and the bordering light” of lost infancy; the processional\r\ngrandeur of old books, which he fearlessly calls\r\n\r\n    “The track of fled souls, and their Milky Way”;\r\n\r\nand visions of the Judgment, when\r\n\r\n                        “from the right\r\n    The white sheep pass into a whiter light.”\r\n\r\nHere the figure beautifully forecasts a famous one of Rossetti’s.\r\nLight, indeed, is Vaughan’s distinctive word, and the favorite source\r\nof his similes and illustrations.\r\n\r\nIf Vaughan’s had not been so profoundly moral a nature, he would\r\nhave lacked his picturesque sense of the general, the continuous.\r\nThat shibboleth, “a primrose by the river’s brim,” is to him all the\r\ngenerations of all the yellow primroses smiling there since the Druids’\r\nday, and its mild moonlike ray reflects the hope and fear and pathos\r\nof the mortal pilgrimage that has seen and saluted it, age after age.\r\nWhatever he meets upon his walk is drowned and dimmed in a wide halo\r\nof association and sympathy. His unmistakable accent marks the opening\r\nof a little sermon called _The Timber_; a sigh of pity, tender as a\r\nchild’s, over the fallen and unlovely logs:\r\n\r\n    “Sure, thou didst flourish once! and many springs\r\n       Many bright mornings, much dew, many showers,\r\n     Passed o’er thy head; many light hearts and wings,\r\n       Which now are dead, lodged in thy living towers.”[29]\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt once challenged England and America[30] to produce anything\r\napproaching, for music and feeling, the beauty of\r\n\r\n              “boughs that shake against the cold,\r\n    Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.”\r\n\r\nHe forgot the closes of these artless lines of a minor poet; or he did\r\nnot know them.\r\n\r\nVaughan’s meek reputation began to renew itself about 1828, when four\r\ncritics eminently fitted to appraise his worth were in their prime;\r\nbut, curiously enough, none of these, not even the best of them, the\r\nsame Charles Lamb who said a just and generous word for Wither, had the\r\nsatisfaction of rescuing his sunken name. Lamb’s friend, the good soul\r\nBernard Barton, seems, however, to have known and admired his Vaughan.\r\n\r\nEight little books, if we count the two parts of _Silex Scintillans_\r\nas one,[31] enclose all of the Silurist’s original work. He began to\r\npublish in 1646, and he practically ceased in 1655, reappearing but\r\nin 1678 with _Thalia Rediviva_, which was not issued under his own\r\nsupervision. It is commonly supposed that his verses were forgotten\r\nup to the date (1847) of the faulty but timely Aldine edition of the\r\nRev. H. F. Lyte, thrice reprinted and revised since then, and until the\r\nappearance of Dr. Grosart’s four inestimable quartos; but Mr. Carew\r\nHazlitt has been fortunate enough to discover the advertisement of an\r\neighteenth-century reprint of Vaughan. As the results of Dr. Grosart’s\r\npatient service to our elder writers are necessarily semi-private,\r\nit may be said with truth that the real Vaughan is still debarred\r\nfrom the general reader, who is, indeed, the identical person least\r\nconcerned about that state of affairs. His name is not irrecoverable\r\nnor unfamiliar to scholars.[32] His mind, on the whole, might pass\r\nfor the product of yesterday; and he, who needs no glossary, may\r\nhandsomely cede the honors of one to Mr. William Morris. It is at least\r\ncertain that had Vaughan lately lifted up his sylvan voice out of\r\nBrecknockshire, he would not so readily be accused of having modelled\r\nhimself unduly upon George Herbert.[33] He has gone into eclipse behind\r\nthat gracious name.\r\n\r\nHenry Vaughan was a child of thirteen when Herbert, a stranger to\r\nhim, died at Bemerton, and he read him first in the sick-chamber to\r\nwhich the five years’ distresses of his early manhood confined him.\r\nThe reading could not have been prior to 1647, for _Olor Iscanus_,\r\nVaughan’s second volume, was lying ready for the press that year, as\r\nwe know from the date of its dedication to Lord Kildare Digby. As no\r\nnovice poet, therefore, he fell under the spell of a sweet and elect\r\nsoul, who was also a lover of vanquished royalty, a convert who had\r\nlooked upon the vanities of the court and the city, a Welshman born,\r\nand not unconnected with Vaughan’s own ancient and patrician house.\r\nThese were slight coincidences, but they served to strengthen a forming\r\ntie. The Silurist somewhere thanks Herbert’s “holy ever-living lines”\r\nfor checking his blood; and it was, perhaps, the only service rendered\r\nof which he was conscious. But his endless iambics and his vague\r\nallegorical titles are cast thoroughly in the manner of Herbert, and\r\nhe takes from the same source the heaped categorical epithets, the\r\ndidactic tone, and the introspectiveness which are his most obvious\r\nfailings. Vaughan’s intellectual debt to Herbert resolves itself into\r\nsomewhat less than nothing; for in following him with zeal to the\r\nMissionary College of the Muses, he lost rather than gained, and he\r\nis altogether delightful and persuasive only where he is altogether\r\nhimself. Nevertheless, a certain spirit of conformity and filial\r\npiety towards Herbert has betrayed Vaughan into frequent and flagrant\r\nimitations. It seems as if these must have been voluntary, and rooted\r\nin an intention to enforce the same truths in all but the same\r\nwords; for the moment Vaughan breaks into invective, or comes upon\r\nhis distinctive topics, such as childhood, natural beauty (for which\r\nHerbert had an imperfect sense), friendship, early death, spiritual\r\nexpectation, he is off and away, free of any predecessor, thrilling and\r\nunforgettable. Comparisons will not be out of place here, for Vaughan\r\ncan bear, and even invoke them. Dryden said in Jonson’s praise that he\r\nwas “a learned plagiary,” and nobody doubts nowadays that Shakespeare\r\nand Milton were the bandit kings of their time. There was, indeed,\r\nin English letters, up to Queen Anne’s reign, an open communism of\r\nideas and idioms astonishing to look upon; there is less confiscation\r\nat present, because, outside the pale of the sciences, there is less\r\nthinking. If any one thing can be closer to another, for instance, than\r\neven Drummond’s sonnet on _Sleep_ is to Sidney’s, it is the dress of\r\nVaughan’s morality to that of George Herbert’s. Mr. Simcox is the only\r\ncritic who has taken the trouble to contrast them, and he does so in\r\nso random a fashion as to suggest that his scrutiny, in some cases,\r\nhas been confined to the rival titles. It is certain that no other\r\nmind, however bent upon identifications, can find a likeness between\r\n_The Quip_ and _The Queer_, or between _The Tempest_ and _Providence_.\r\nVaughan’s _Mutiny_, like _The Collar_, ends in a use of the word\r\n“child,” after a scene of strife; and if ever it were meant to match\r\nHerbert’s poem, distinctly falls behind it, and deals, besides, with\r\na much weaker rebelliousness. _Rules and Lessons_ is so unmistakably\r\nmodelled upon _The Church Porch_ that it scarcely calls for comment.\r\nHerbert’s admonitions, however, are continued, but nowhere repeated;\r\nand Vaughan’s succeed in being poetic, which the others are not. Beyond\r\nthese replicas, Vaughan’s structural genius is in no wise beholden to\r\nHerbert’s. But numerous phrases and turns of thought descend from the\r\nmaster to the disciple, undergoing such subtle and peculiar changes,\r\nand given back, as Coleridge would say, with such “usurious interest,”\r\nthat it may well be submitted whether, in this casual list, every\r\nborrowing, save two, be not a bettering.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT.\r\n\r\n    “A throbbing conscience, spurrèd by remorse,\r\n               Hath a strange force.”\r\n\r\n    “My thoughts are all a case of knives,\r\n             Wounding my heart\r\n             With scattered smart.”\r\n\r\n                 “And trust\r\n    Half that we have\r\n    Unto an honest faithful grave.”\r\n\r\n    “Teach me Thy love to know,\r\n       That this new light which now I see\r\n     May both the work and workman show:\r\n       Then by a sunbeam I will climb to Thee!”\r\n\r\n    “I will go searching, till I find a sun\r\n           Shall stay till we have done,\r\n     A willing shiner, that will shine as gladly\r\n           As frost-nipt suns look sadly.\r\n     Then we will sing and shine all our own day,\r\n           And one another pay;\r\n     His beams shall cheer my breast, and both so twine\r\n     Till even his beams sing, and my music shine.”\r\n\r\n(_Of prayer._)\r\n\r\n    “Heaven in ordinary, man well-drest,\r\n     The Milky Way, the bird of Paradise.”\r\n\r\n    “Then went I to a garden, and did spy\r\n              A gallant flower,\r\n     The crown-imperial: Sure, said I,\r\n          Peace at the root must dwell.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n    “A darting conscience, full of stabs and fears.”\r\n\r\n    “And wrap us in imaginary flights\r\n     Wide of a faithful grave.”\r\n\r\n    “That in these masks and shadows I may see\r\n               Thy sacred way,\r\n     And by these hid ascents climb to that day\r\n               Which breaks from Thee\r\n     Who art in all things, though invisibly!”\r\n\r\n    “O would I were a bird or star\r\n     Fluttering in woods, or lifted far\r\n              Above this inn\r\n              And road of sin!\r\n     Then either star or bird would be\r\n     Shining or singing still to Thee!”\r\n\r\n(_Of books._)\r\n\r\n    “The track of fled souls, and their Milky Way.”\r\n\r\n    “I walked the other day to spend my hour\r\n               Into a field,\r\n     Where I sometime had seen the soil to yield\r\n               A gallant flower.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT.\r\n\r\n    “But groans are quick and full of wings,\r\n       And all their motions upward be,\r\n     And ever as they mount, like larks they sing:\r\n     The note is sad, yet music for a king.”\r\n\r\n    “Joys oft are there, and griefs as oft as joys,\r\n           But griefs without a noise;\r\n     Yet speak they louder than distempered fears:\r\n           What is so shrill as silent tears?”\r\n\r\n    “At first Thou gavest me milk and sweetnesses,\r\n           I had my wish and way;\r\n     My days were strewed with flowers and happiness;\r\n           There was no month but May.”\r\n\r\n               “Only a scarf or glove\r\n    Doth warm our hands, and make them write of Love.”\r\n\r\n    “I got me flowers to strew Thy way,\r\n       I got me boughs off many a tree;\r\n     But Thou wast up by break of day,\r\n       And brought Thy sweets along with Thee.”\r\n\r\n    “O come! for Thou dost know the way:\r\n       Or if to me Thou wilt not move,\r\n     Remove me where I need not say,\r\n       ‘Drop from above.’”\r\n\r\n    “Sure Thou wilt joy by gaining me\r\n     To fly home like a laden bee.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n    “A silent tear can pierce Thy throne\r\n       When loud joys want a wing;\r\n     And sweeter airs stream from a groan\r\n       Than any artèd string.”\r\n\r\n    “Follow the cry no more! There is\r\n             An ancient way,\r\n     All strewed with flowers and happiness,\r\n             And fresh as May!”\r\n\r\n                   “feverish souls\r\n    Sick with a scarf or glove.”\r\n\r\n    “I’ll get me up before the sun,\r\n       I’ll cull me boughs off many a tree;\r\n     And all alone full early run\r\n       To gather flowers and welcome Thee.”\r\n\r\n    “Either disperse these mists, which blot and fill\r\n       My perspective still as they pass;\r\n     Or else remove me hence unto that hill\r\n       Where I shall need no glass!”\r\n\r\n    “Thy grave, to which my thoughts shall move\r\n     Like bees in storms unto their hive.”\r\n\r\nTo arraign Vaughan is to vindicate him. In the too liberal assizes of\r\nliterature, an idea becomes the property of him who best expresses\r\nit. Herbert’s odd and fresh metaphors, his homing bees and pricks of\r\nconscience and silent tears, the adoring star and the comrade bird,\r\neven his famous female scarf, go over bodily to the spoiler. In many an\r\ninstance something involved and difficult still characterizes Herbert’s\r\ndiction; and it is diverting to watch how the interfering hand sorts\r\nand settles it at one touch, and sends it, in Mr. Matthew Arnold’s\r\nword, to the “centre.” Vaughan’s mind, despite its mysticism, was full\r\nof despatch and impetuosity. Like Herbert, he alludes to himself, more\r\nthan once, as “fierce”; and the adjective undoubtedly belongs to him.\r\nThere is in Vaughan, at his height, an imaginative rush and fire which\r\nHerbert never knew, a greater clarity and conciseness, a far greater\r\nrestraint, a keener sense both of color and form, and so much more\r\ndeference for what Mr. Ruskin calls “the peerage of words,” that the\r\nyounger man could never have been content to send forth a line which\r\nmight mean its opposite, such as occurs in the fine stanza about glory\r\nin the beautiful _Quip_. It is only on middle ground that the better\r\npoet and the better saint collide. Vaughan never could have written\r\n\r\n    “O that I once past changing were\r\n     Fast in Thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!”\r\n\r\nor the tranquil confession of faith:\r\n\r\n    “Whether I fly with angels, fall with dust,\r\n       Thy hands made both, and I am there:\r\n     Thy power and love, my love and trust\r\n       Make one place everywhere!”\r\n\r\nFor his best is not Herbert’s best, nor his worst Herbert’s worst. It\r\nis not Vaughan who reminds us that “filth” lies under a fair face. He\r\ndoes the “fiercer” thing: he goes to the Pit’s mouth in a trance, and\r\n“hears them yell.” Herbert’s noblest and most winning art still has its\r\nstand upon the altar steps of _The Temple_; but Vaughan is always on\r\nthe roof, under the stars, like a somnambulist, or actually above and\r\nout of sight, “pinnacled dim in the intense inane”; absorbed in larger\r\nand wilder things, and stretching the spirits of all who try to follow\r\nhim. Herbert has had his reward in the world’s lasting appreciation;\r\nand though Vaughan had a favorable opinion of his own staying powers,\r\nnothing would have grieved him less than to step aside, if the choice\r\nhad lain between him and his exemplar. Or re-risen, he would cry\r\nloyally to him, as to that other Herbert, the rector of Llangattock and\r\nhis old tutor: “_Pars vertat patri, vita posthuma tibi_.”\r\n\r\nVaughan, then, owed something to Herbert, although it was by no means\r\nthe best which Herbert could give; but he himself is, what Herbert is\r\nnot, an ancestor. He leans forward to touch Cowper and Keble; and Mr.\r\nChurton Collins has taken the pains to trace him in Tennyson.\r\n\r\nThe angels who\r\n\r\n                    “familiarly confer\r\n    Beneath the oak and juniper,”\r\n\r\ninvoke an instant thought of the Milton of the _Allegro_; and the\r\nfragrant winds which linger by Usk, “loaden with the rich arrear,”\r\nappear to be Milton’s, too. His austere music first sounded in the\r\npublic ear in 1645, one year before Vaughan, much his junior, began\r\nto print. It would seem very unlikely that a Welsh physician should\r\nbe beholden long after to the manuscripts of the Puritan stripling,\r\nclose-kept at Cambridge and Horton; but it is interesting to find the\r\nprototype of Vaughan’s charming lines about Rachel,\r\n\r\n    “the sheep-keeping Syrian maid,”\r\n\r\nin the _Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester_, dating from\r\n1631.[34] Vaughan’s dramatic Fleet Street,\r\n\r\n    “Where the loud whip and coach scolds all the way,”\r\n\r\nmight as well be Swift’s, or Crabbe’s; and his salutation to the lark,\r\n\r\n    “And now, as fresh and cheerful as the light,\r\n     Thy little heart in early hymns doth sing,”\r\n\r\nis like a quotation from some tender sonnet of Bowles, or from his\r\nadmirer, the young Coleridge who instantly outstepped him. _Olor_,\r\n_Silex_, and _Thalia_ establish unexpected relationships with genius\r\nthe most remote from them and from each other. The animated melody of\r\npoor Rochester’s best songs seems deflected from\r\n\r\n    “If I were dead, and in my place,”\r\n\r\naddressed to Amoret,[35] in the _Poems_ of 1646. The delicate simile,\r\n\r\n    “As some blind dial, when the day is done,\r\n     Can tell us at midnight there was a sun,”\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    “But I am sadly loose and stray,\r\n     A giddy blast each way.\r\n     O let me not thus range:\r\n     Thou canst not change!”\r\n\r\n(a verse of a poem headed by an extract, in the Vulgate, from the\r\neighth chapter to the Romans), come home with a smile to the lover of\r\nClough. Vaughan was that dangerous person, an original thinker; and the\r\nconsequence is that he compromises a great many authors who may never\r\nhave heard of him. It is admitted now that we owe to his prophetic lyre\r\none of the boasts of modern literature. Dr. Grosart has handled so well\r\nthe obvious debt of Wordsworth in _The Intimations of Immortality_, and\r\nhas proven so conclusively that Vaughan figured in the library at Rydal\r\nMount, that little need be said here on that theme. In _Corruption_,\r\n_Childhood_, _Looking Back_, and _The Retreat_, most markedly in the\r\nfirst, lie the whole point and pathos of\r\n\r\n    “Trailing clouds of glory do we come\r\n     From Heaven, which is our home.”\r\n\r\nFew studies are more fascinating than that of the liquidation, so\r\nto speak, of Vaughan’s brief, tense, impassioned monodies into “the\r\nmighty waters rolling evermore” of the great _Ode_. It is Holinshed’s\r\naccidental honor that he is lost in Shakespeare, and incorporated\r\nwith him. So with Vaughan: if shorn of his dues, he still remains\r\nillustrious by virtue of one signal service to Wordsworth, whom, in the\r\nmain, he distinctly foreshadows. Yet it is no unpardonable heresy to be\r\njealous that the “first sprightly runnings” of a classic should not be\r\nbetter known, and to prefer their touching simplicity to the grandly\r\nadult and theory-burdened lines which everybody quotes. In the broad\r\nrange of English letters we find two persons whose normal mental habits\r\nseem altogether of a piece with Vaughan’s: a woman of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and a philosopher of the nineteenth. The lovely _Petition for\r\nan Absolute Retreat_, by Anne, Countess of Winchelsea (whose genius\r\nwas the charming _trouvaille_ of Mr. Edmund Gosse), might pass for\r\nVaughan’s, in Vaughan’s best manner; and so might\r\n\r\n    “Their near camp my spirit knows\r\n     By signs gracious as rainbows,”\r\n\r\nas indeed the whole of Emerson’s ever-memorable _Forerunners_, itself a\r\nmate for _The Retreat_; or rather, had these been anonymous lyrics of\r\nVaughan’s own day, it would have been impossible to persuade a Caroline\r\ncritic that he could not name their common author.\r\n\r\nOur poet had a curious fashion of coining verbs and adjectives out of\r\nnouns, and carried it to such a degree as to challenge pre-eminence\r\nwith Keats.\r\n\r\n      “O how it bloods\r\n    And spirits all my earth!”\r\n\r\nis part and parcel of the young cries of Endymion. When Vaughan has\r\ndiscovered something to produce a fresh effect, he is not the man who\r\nwill hesitate to use it; and this mannerism occurs frequently: “our\r\ngrass straight russets,” “angel’d from that sphere,” “the mountained\r\nwave,” “He heavened their walks, and with his eyes made those wild\r\nshades a Paradise.” A little informality of this sort sometimes\r\njustifies itself, as in the couplet ending the grim and powerful\r\n_Charnel-House_:\r\n\r\n    “But should wild blood swell to a lawless strain,\r\n     One check from thee shall channel it again!”\r\n\r\nAnd Henry Vaughan shares also with Keats, writing three hundred\r\nyears later, a defect which he had inherited, together with many\r\ngraces, directly from Ben Jonson:[36] the fashion of crowding the\r\nsense of his text and the pauseless voice of his reader from the\r\nnatural breathing-place at the end of a line into the beginning or\r\nthe middle of the next line. More than any other, except Keats in his\r\nfirst period, he roughens, without always strengthening, his rich\r\ndecasyllabics, by using what Mr. Gosse has happily classified as the\r\n“overflow.”\r\n\r\nThough the Silurist had in him the possibilities of a great elegiac\r\npoet, and his laments for his dead are many and memorable, there is not\r\none sustained masterpiece among them; nothing to equal or approach,\r\nfor example, Cowley’s _Ode on the Death of Mr. William Hervey_, in\r\nthe qualities which abide, and are visited with the honors of the\r\nclass-book and the library shelf. Yet Vaughan’s elegies are exquisite\r\nand endearing; they haunt one with the conviction that they stop short\r\nof immortality, not because their author had too little skill, but\r\nbecause, between his repressed speech and his extreme emotions, no art\r\ncould make out to live. He had a deep heart, such as deep hearts will\r\nalways recognize and reverence:\r\n\r\n    “And thy two wings were grief and love.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of eternity he seems so to accord with the event which\r\nall but destroys him, that sorrow inexpressible becomes suddenly\r\nunexpressed, and his funeral music ends in a high enthusiasm and\r\nserenity open to no misconception. Distance, and the lapse of time,\r\nand his own utter reconciliation to the play of events make small\r\ndifference in his utterance upon the old topic. The thought of his\r\nfriend, forty years after, is the same mystical rapture:\r\n\r\n    “O could I track them! but souls must\r\n           Track one the other;\r\n     And now the spirit, not the dust,\r\n           Must be thy brother:\r\n     Yet I have one pearl by whose light\r\n           All things I see,\r\n     And in the heart of death and night,\r\n           Find Heaven and thee.”\r\n\r\n_Daphnis_, the eclogue to the memory of Thomas Vaughan, is the only\r\none of these elegies which, possessing a surplus of beautiful lines,\r\nis not even in the least satisfying. “R. Hall,” “no woolsack soldier,”\r\nwho was slain at the siege of Pontefract, won from Henry Vaughan a\r\npassionate requiem, which opens with a gush of agony, “I knew it would\r\nbe thus!” as affecting as anything in the early ballads; and the battle\r\nof Rowton Heath took from him “R. W.,” the comrade of his youth. But\r\nit was in one who bore his sovereign’s name (hitherto unidentified,\r\nalthough he is said to have been the subject of a “public sorrow”) that\r\nVaughan lost the friend upon whom his whole nature seemed to lean. The\r\nsoldier-heart in himself spoke out firmly in the cry he consecrated\r\n_To the Pious Memory of C. W._ Its masculine dignity; the pride and\r\nsoft triumph which it gathers about it, advancing; the plain heroic\r\nending which sweeps away all images of remoteness and gloom, in\r\n\r\n    “Good-morrow to dear Charles! for it is day,”\r\n\r\ncan be compared to nothing but an _agitato_ of Schubert’s mounting\r\nstrings, slowing to their major chord with a courage and cheer that\r\nbring tears to the eyes. Vaughan’s tender threnodies would make a small\r\nbut precious volume. _To the Pious Memory_, with _Thou that Knowest for\r\nWhom I Mourn_, _Silence and Stealth of Days_, _Joy of my Life while\r\nLeft me Here_, _I Walked the other Day to spend my Hour_, _The Morning\r\nWatch_, and _Beyond the Veil_, are alone enough to give him rank\r\nforever as a genius and a good man.\r\n\r\n“C. W.’s” death was one of the things which turned him forever from\r\ntemporal pursuits and pleasures. Of his first wife we can find none but\r\nconjectural traces in his books, for he was shy of using the beloved\r\nname. The sense of those departed is never far from him. The air of\r\nmelancholy recollection, not morbid, which hangs over his maturer\r\nlyrics, is directly referable to the close-following calamities which\r\nestranged him from the presence of “the blessèd few,” and sent him, as\r\nhe nobly hoped,\r\n\r\n    “Home from their dust to empty his own glass.”\r\n\r\nHis thoughts centred, henceforward, in their full intensity, on the\r\nsupernatural world; nay, if he were irremediably depressed, not only\r\non the persistence of resolved matter, by means of which buried men\r\ncome forth again in the color of flowers and the fragrance of the wind,\r\nbut even on the physical damp and dark which confine our mortality. It\r\nis the poet of dawn and of crisp mountain air who can pack horror on\r\nhorror into his nervous quatrains about Death:\r\n\r\n    “A nest of nights; a gloomy sphere\r\n       Where shadows thicken, and the cloud\r\n     Sits on the sun’s brow all the year,\r\n       And nothing moves without a shroud.”\r\n\r\nThis is masterly; but here, again, there is reserve, the curbing hand\r\nof a man who holds, with Plato, a wilful indulgence in the “realism” of\r\nsadness to be an actual crime. Vaughan’s dead dwell, indeed, as his own\r\nmind does, in “the world of light.” As his corporeal sight is always\r\nupon the zenith or the horizon, so his fancy is far away, with his\r\nradiant ideals, and with the virtue and beauty he has walked with in\r\nthe flesh. He takes his harp to the topmost hill, and sits watching\r\n\r\n    “till the white-winged reapers come.”\r\n\r\nHe thinks of his obscured self, the child he was, and of “the narrow\r\nway” (an ever-recurrent Scriptural phrase in his poetry) by which he\r\nshall “travel back.” To leave the body is merely to start anew and\r\nrecover strength, and, with it, the inspiring companionship of which he\r\nis inscrutably deprived.\r\n\r\nChambers’ _Cyclopædia_ made an epic blunder, long ago, when it ascribed\r\nto this gentlest of Anglicans a “gloomy sectarianism.” He, of all\r\nreligious poets, makes the most charming secular reading, and may well\r\nbe a favorite with the heathen for whom Herbert is too decorative,\r\nCrashaw too hectic and intense, Cowper too fearful, and Faber too\r\nfluent; _Lyra Apostolica_ a treatise, though a glorious one, on Things\r\nwhich Must be Revived, and _Hymns Ancient and Modern_ an exceeding\r\nweariness to the spirit. It is a saw of Dr. Johnson’s that it is\r\nimpossible for theology to clothe itself in attractive numbers; but\r\nthen Dr. Johnson was ignorant of Vaughan. It is not in human nature to\r\nrefuse to cherish the “holy, happy, healthy Heaven” which he has left\r\nus (in a graded alliteration which smacks of the physician rather than\r\nof the “gloomy sectarian”), his very social “angels talking to a man,”\r\nand his bright saints, hovering and smiling nigh, who\r\n\r\n        “are indeed our pillar-fires\r\n          Seen as we go;\r\n    They are the city’s shining spires\r\n          We travel to.”\r\n\r\nWho can resist the earnestness and candor with which, in a few\r\nsessions, he wrote down the white passion of the last fifty years\r\nof his life? No English poet, unless it be Spenser, has a piety so\r\nsimple and manly, so colored with mild thought, so free from emotional\r\nconsciousness. The elect given over to continual polemics do not count\r\nHenry Vaughan as one of themselves. His double purpose is to make life\r\npleasant to others and to praise God; and he considers that he is\r\naccomplishing it when he pens a compliment to the valley grass, or,\r\nlike Coleridge, caresses in some affectionate strophes the much-abused\r\nlittle ass. All this liberal sweetness and charity heighten Vaughan’s\r\npoetic quality, as they deepen the impression of his practical\r\nChristianity. The nimbus is about his laic songs. When he talks of\r\nmoss and rocks, it is as if they were incorporated into the ritual. He\r\nhas the genius of prayer, and may be recognized by “those graces which\r\nwalk in a veil and a silence.” He is full of distinction, and of a sort\r\nof golden idiosyncrasy. Vaughan’s true “note” is—Vaughan. To read him\r\nis like coming alone to a village church-yard with trees, where the\r\nwest is dying, in hues of lilac and rose, behind the low ivied Norman\r\ntower. The south windows are open, the young choir are within, and the\r\norganist, with many a hushed unconventional interlude of his own, is\r\nrehearsing with them the psalm of “pleasures for evermore.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Siluria comprised the shires of Monmouth, Hereford, Glamorgan,\r\nRadnor, and Brecon.\r\n\r\n[21] The Reverend H. F. Lyte, Vaughan’s enthusiastic editor, best known\r\nas the author of _Abide with Me_, reminds us that there was another\r\nHenry Vaughan of the same college and the same neighborhood at home—a\r\npleasant theological person not to be confounded with the poet. It was\r\nprobably he, and not the Silurist, who devoted some verses to Charles\r\nthe First in the book called _Eucharistica Oxoniensis_, 1641.\r\n\r\n[22] These deep Augustinian lines are Carew’s, gay Carew’s; and they\r\nmark the highest religious expression of their time.\r\n\r\n[23] Vaughan apparently enjoyed that privilege of genius, acquaintance\r\nwith a London garret, if we may take autobiographically the fine brag\r\nworthy of the tribe of Henri Mürger:\r\n\r\n“I scorn your land, So far it lies below me; here I see How all the\r\nsacred stars do circle me.”\r\n\r\n[24] The King lodged at Christchurch, the Queen and my Lady Castlemaine\r\n(together, alas!) at Merton, amid endless hawking, tennis, boating,\r\nbasset, and general revelry.\r\n\r\n[25] Orinda’s own verses, scattered in manuscript among her friends,\r\nwere collected and printed without her knowledge, and much against her\r\ndesire, in 1663: a piece of treachery which threw her into a severe\r\nindisposition. She could therefore condole more than enough with Henry\r\nVaughan. Friends were officious creatures in those days.\r\n\r\n[26] This, to say the least, was not “pretty” of Campbell, who thought\r\nso well of the “world’s grey fathers” congregated to gaze at Vaughan’s\r\n_Rainbow_ that he conveyed them bodily into the foreground of his own.\r\n\r\n[27] Per´-spective was, of course, the general pronunciation from\r\nShakespeare to Dr. Johnson, and is used with great beauty in Dryden’s\r\n_Ode to the Memory of Mrs. Anne Killigrew_. But it is a characteristic\r\nword with Vaughan, and it was from Vaughan that Wordsworth took it.\r\n\r\n[28] Vaughan had a relish for damp weather, the thing which makes the\r\nloveliness of the British isles, and which the ungrateful islanders\r\nare prone to revile. He never passes a sheet of water without looking\r\nupward for the forming cloud:\r\n\r\n“That drowsy lake From her faint bosom breathed thee!”\r\n\r\n[29] Sometimes erroneously printed “bowers.”\r\n\r\n[30] It was kind of the ever-kind Hunt to include America in his\r\nenumeration, at a time when the United States were supposed by his\r\nfellow-countrymen to have no literature at all of their own. The\r\ncircumstance that his challenge appeared in the preface to _The Book\r\nof the Sonnet_, which was edited by Hunt in conjunction with an\r\nAmerican, and published at Boston in 1868, may help to account for the\r\nmannerliness of the reference.\r\n\r\n[31] In the _Letters and Memorials of Archbishop Trench_, vol. ii.,\r\np. 57, there is a letter bearing upon this point from Mr. Frank\r\nMillson, dated 1868, which deserves serious consideration from\r\nVaughan’s forthcoming editors. “I think,” he writes the Dean, “that\r\nyour supposition that the 1655 edition is the same book as the one\r\nof 1650, with a new title-page and additions, can hardly be correct,\r\nthough I know that Lyte, the editor of Pickering’s reprint, thinks as\r\nyou do. The preface to the 1655 edition is dated September 30, 1654,\r\nand contains this passage” (not given in the _Memorials_) “which seems\r\nto me to refer to the fact of a new edition. A comparison of my two\r\ncopies shows that the 1650 edition consists of half a sheet, title\r\nand dedication, and 110 pages. The second edition has title, preface,\r\ndedication, motto, the 110 pages of the first edition, with 84 pages\r\nof new matter, and a table of first lines. A noticeable thing in the\r\narrangement is that the sheets do not begin with new printer’s marks,\r\nas they might be expected to do if the second part were simply new\r\nmatter added to the first volume, but begin with A, the last sheet of\r\nthe former volume having ended with G. I am sorry to trouble you with\r\nthese trifling details; but as Vaughan has long been a favorite author\r\nof mine, they have an interest for me, and if they help to show that he\r\nwas not neglected by readers of his own time, I shall be glad.”\r\n\r\n[32] Anthologies and cyclopædias nowadays, especially since Dr. John\r\nBrown and Principal Shairp drew attention to the Silurist in their\r\npages, are more than likely to admit him. It was not so always.\r\nWinstanley, sharp as was his eye, let Vaughan escape him in his\r\n_Lives of the Poets_, published in 1687. He is not in the _Theatrum\r\nPoetarum_, nor in Johnson’s _Lives_. He is in neither of Southey’s\r\ncollections. Mr. Palgrave allows him, in _The Golden Treasury_, but\r\na song and a half; Ellis’s sheaf of excellent _Specimens_ of 1811\r\nfurnishes eighteen lines of a wedding blessing on the _Best and Most\r\nAccomplished Couple_ apologizing for “their too much quaintness and\r\nconceit”; and in Willmott’s _Sacred Poets_ Vaughan occupies four\r\npages, as against Crashaw’s thirty-five, Herbert’s thirty-seven, and\r\nWither’s one hundred and thirty-two. But Vaughan fares well in Dr.\r\nGeorge Macdonald’s _England’s Antiphon_, and in Archbishop Trench’s\r\n_Household Book_. Ward’s _English Poets_, in the second volume, has a\r\nconventional selection from him, as has, at greater length, Fields’ and\r\nWhipple’s _Family Library of British Poetry_. There is a goodly list\r\nentered under Vaughan’s name in Gilfillan’s _Less-Known British Poets_,\r\nall chosen from his devotional work. Thirty-seven religious lyrics\r\nagain adorn the splendid _Treasury of Sacred Song_. Vaughan’s secular\r\nnumbers yet await their proper bays, although a limited edition of most\r\nof them, containing a bibliography, was printed in 1893 by J. R. Tutin\r\nof Hull. Mr. Saintsbury, in his _Seventeenth Century Lyrics_, has a\r\nsmall and very choice group of Vaughan’s songs, and Professor Palgrave,\r\nhaving to do with him for the third time, gives him large and cordial\r\nhonor in the eleventh volume of _Y Cymmrodor_. In Emerson’s Parnassus\r\nhe appears but once. He had his most graceful and grateful American\r\ntribute when Mr. Lowell, long ago, named him in passing as “dear Henry\r\nVaughan,” in _A Certain Condescension in Foreigners_.\r\n\r\n[33] In one of his prefaces, Vaughan hits neatly at the crowd of\r\nHerbertists: “These aim more at verse than at perfection.” Where there\r\nare noble resemblances, it is well to remember that two sides have the\r\nright to be heard. Mrs. Thoreau used to say: “Mr. Emerson imitates\r\nHenry!” And she was at least as accurate as the critics who annoyed her\r\nold age by the reversed statement.\r\n\r\n[34] Mr. R. H. Stoddard owns a copy of the first edition of\r\n_Nieremberg’s Meditations_, translated by Vaughan in 1654, and\r\npublished the following year, which has upon the title-page an\r\nautographic “J. M.” supposed, by every evidence, to be Milton’s. If it\r\nbe so, the busy Latin Secretary, meditating his grand work, must have\r\nbeen, on his part, a reader and a lover of the man who was almost his\r\nequal at golden phrases.\r\n\r\n[35] Congreve and Waller employ the same rather too obvious love-name\r\nfor their serenaded divinities.\r\n\r\n[36] Vaughan openly wears jewels which belong to Jonson.\r\n\r\n“Go seek thy peace in war: Who falls for love of God shall rise a star!”\r\n\r\nwrote brave Father Ben; and no Englishman of spirit, between 1642 and\r\nthe Restoration, was likely to forget it. The passage certainly clung\r\nto Vaughan’s mind, for he assimilated it later in a sweet line all for\r\npeace:\r\n\r\n“Do thou the works of day, and rise a star.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nGEORGE FARQUHAR\r\n\r\n1677-1707\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a narrow dark Essex Street West in the city of Dublin, running\r\nbetween Fishamble Street and Essex Gate, at the rear of the Lower\r\nBlind Quay. The older people still bluntly call it what it was called\r\nbefore 1830: Smock Alley. On its north side stands the sufficiently\r\nugly church of SS. Michael and John. The arched passage still in use,\r\nparallel with the nave of this church, was the entrance to a theatre\r\non the same site; what is now the burial vault was once the pit, full\r\nof ruddy and uproarious faces. The theatre, erected about 1660, which\r\nhad a long, stormy and eventful history, was rebuilt in 1735, and\r\nhaving been turned into a warehouse, fell into decay, to be replaced\r\nby a building of another clay. But while it was still itself, it was\r\ngreat and popular, and the lane between Trinity College and the old\r\narched passage was choked every night with the press of jolly youths,\r\nwho, as Archbishop King pathetically complained, appeared to love the\r\nplay better than study! Among those who hung about Smock Alley like a\r\nbarnacle in the years 1694 and 1695, was a certain George Farquhar,\r\nson of William,[37] a poor Londonderry clergyman of the Establishment;\r\na long-faced peculiar lad of mild mien but high spirits. He had come\r\nfrom the north, under episcopal patronage, to wear a queer dress among\r\nhis social betters, to sweep and scour and carry tankards of ale to\r\nthe Fellows in hall; and incidentally, to imbibe, on his own part, the\r\nlore of all the ages. The major event in his history is that, instead\r\nof sitting up nights over _Isocrates de Pace_, he slipped off to see\r\nRobert Wilkes and the stock company, and to decide that acting, or,\r\nas he afterwards sarcastically defined it, “tearing his Lungs for a\r\nLivelihood,” was also the thing for him. Wherefore, at eighteen, either\r\nbecause his benefactor, Bishop Wiseman of Dromore, had died, or else,\r\nas is not very credibly reported, because he was cashiered from his\r\nclass, Master Farquhar, cut loose from his old moorings, applied to\r\nManager Ashbury of the Dublin Theatre, and to such avail that he was\r\nable presently to make his own appearance there as no less a personage\r\nthan Othello. He had a weak voice and a shy presence; but the public\r\nencouraged him. One of his first parts was that of Guyomar, Montezuma’s\r\nyounger brother, in Dryden’s tragedy of _The Indian Emperor_. In the\r\nfifth act, as soon as he had declaimed to Vasquez in sounding sing-song:\r\n\r\n    “Friendship with him whose hand did Odmar kill?\r\n     Base as he was, he was my brother still!\r\n     But since his blood has washed away his guilt,\r\n     Nature asks thine for that which thou hast spilt,”\r\n\r\nhe made, according to stage directions, a fierce lunge at his too\r\nconciliatory foe. Guyomar had armed himself, inadvertently, with\r\na genuine sword, and Vasquez came near enough to being killed in\r\nthe flesh. The man eventually recovered; but it shows of what\r\nimpressionable stuff Farquhar was made, that his mental horror\r\nand pain, during that moment while he believed he had slain a\r\nfellow-creature, should have turned the course of his life. He left the\r\nstage; nor would he return to it. Some eight years after, indeed, he\r\nvisited Dublin again, and on the old boards played Sir Harry Wildair\r\nfor his own benefit; but this was at a time when he forced himself to\r\nundertake all honorable chances of money-making, out of his consuming\r\nanxiety for his family.\r\n\r\nWilkes and his wife returned to London, and the lad Farquhar went with\r\nthem. He obtained a commission in the army from the Earl of Orrery;\r\nhe was in Holland on duty during a part of the year 1700, and came\r\nback to England with one of her earliest military red coats on his\r\nback, in the train of his much-approved sovereign, William III. He\r\nhad already written, thanks to Wilkes and his incessant urging, his\r\nfirst two plays, and had seen them successful at Drury Lane;[38] he\r\nhad also overheard with enthusiasm, at the Mitre Tavern in St. James’s\r\nMarket, Mistress Nance Oldfield, an orphan of sixteen, niece of the\r\nproprietress, reading _The Scornful Lady_ behind the bar. Captain\r\nVanbrugh was duly told of Farquhar’s delight and admiration, and on\r\nthe strength of them introduced the girl to Rich, who did few things\r\nso good in his lifetime as when he put her upon the stage at fifteen\r\nshillings a week. It was not long before this distinguished actress\r\nand generous woman, destined to lend her gayety and beautiful bearing\r\nto the interpretation of Farquhar’s women, enlivened the town as the\r\nglorious Sylvia of _The Recruiting Officer_, who can “gallop all the\r\nmorning after a hunting-horn, and all the evening after a fiddle.”\r\n\r\n“We hear of Farquhar at one time,” says Leigh Hunt, in a pretty\r\nsummary, “in Essex, hare-hunting (not in the style of a proficient);\r\nat another, at Richmond, sick; and at a third, in Shropshire on a\r\nrecruiting party, where he was treated with great hospitality, and\r\nfound material for one of the best of his plays.”\r\n\r\n_Love and a Bottle_ inaugurated the vogue of the Farquhar comedy; and\r\nWilkes, whose name in London carried favor and precedence, was the\r\nRoebuck of the cast. Its successors, _The Constant Couple_ (with a\r\nframework transferred and adapted from its author’s earlier _Adventures\r\nof Covent Garden_), and its sequel, _Sir Harry Wildair_, again\r\nchampioned by the “friendly and indefatigable” Wilkes, who impersonated\r\nthe engaging rakish heroes, had long runs, and firmly established\r\ntheir author’s fame. In 1702 Farquhar produced _The Inconstant_ (which\r\nhe had perverted from Fletcher’s _Wild Goose Chase_, as if a fit\r\nsetting were sought for the wonderfully effective last act of his own\r\ndevising); and after _The Inconstant_, _The Twin Rivals_. _The Stage\r\nCoach_, a one-act farce in which he had a collaborator,[39] dates from\r\n1704, and _The Recruiting Officer_ from 1706; _The Beaux’ Stratagem_\r\nwas written in the spring of 1707. This is a working record of barely\r\nnine years; it represents a secure and continuous artistic advance; and\r\nit should have brought its patient originator something better than the\r\nprivilege of dying young, “broken-hearted,” as he confessed to Wilkes,\r\n“and without a shilling.”\r\n\r\nFarquhar had but the trifling income of an officer’s pay on which to\r\nsupport his wife and his two little daughters. He seems to have sought\r\nno political preferment, nor did his numerous patrons put themselves\r\nout to advance him, although these were the very days when men of\r\nletters were crowded into the public service. Ever and anon he received\r\nfifteen guineas, then a very handsome sum, for a play. Perhaps,\r\nlike his rash gallants, he had “a head to get money, and a heart to\r\nspend it.” He greatly wished success, for the sake of those never\r\nabsent from his thought; and he complained bitterly when the French\r\nacrobats and rope-dancers took from _The Twin Rivals_ the attention of\r\npleasure-seeking Londoners, much as poor Haydon complained afterwards\r\nof the crowds who surged down Piccadilly, to behold not his “Christ’s\r\nEntry into Jerusalem” at all, but General Tom Thumb, holding court\r\nunder the same roof.\r\n\r\nWhen Farquhar’s health was breaking, and debts began to involve him at\r\nlast, it appears that the Earl of Ormonde, his general, prompted him\r\nto sell his commission in order to liquidate them, and agreed to give\r\nhim a captaincy. Or, as is yet more probable, in view of the fact that\r\nFarquhar was already known by the title of captain, he was urged to\r\nsell out of the army, on a given pledge that preferment of another sort\r\nawaited him. His other industrious devices to secure support for four\r\nhaving missed fire, he gladly performed his part of the transaction,\r\nonly to experience a fatal delay on the part of my Lord Ormonde,\r\nwhose mind had strayed to larger matters. In fine, the unkept promise\r\nhurt the subaltern to the heart; he sank, literally from that hour,\r\nof grief and disquietude. Lintott the stationer, and his old friend\r\nWilkes stood manfully by him, one with liberal payment in advance,\r\nand one with affectionate furtherance and gifts; but Farquhar did not\r\nrally. It was to Wilkes, as everybody knows, that he penned this most\r\ntouching testament: “Dear Bob, I have not anything to leave thee to\r\nperpetuate my memory but two helpless girls. Look upon them sometimes!\r\nand think of him who was, to the last moment of his life, thine.” The\r\nend came on or about April 29, 1707, George Farquhar being just thirty\r\nyears of age. While he lay dying in Soho, his last and best comedy\r\nwas in progress at the new magnificent Haymarket, and his audiences,\r\nwith a barren benevolence not uncharacteristic of the unthinking human\r\nspecies, are said to have wept for him. He was buried in the parish\r\nchurch-yard of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,[40] where Nell Gwynne’s\r\ncontrite ashes lay, and where her legacied bells tolled for his passing.\r\n\r\nFarquhar’s name is always coupled with those of Congreve, Wycherley,\r\nand Vanbrugh, although in spirit and also in point of time he was\r\nremoved from the influences which formed them. Many critics, notably\r\nHazlitt, Macaulay, and Thackeray, have allowed him least mention of the\r\nfour, but he is, in reality, the best playwright among them; and it is\r\ngreatly to the credit of a discreditable period if he be taken as its\r\nrepresentative. He had Vanbrugh’s exuberant vivacity, Congreve’s grace,\r\nWycherley’s knack of climax. Wycherley, retiring into private life when\r\nFarquhar was born, lived to see his exit; Etherege was then at his\r\nzenith; Dryden’s _All for Love_ was in the printer’s case, and Otway,\r\nalmost on the point of his two great works, was coming home ragged\r\nfrom Flanders: Otway, whose boyish ventures on the stage, and whose\r\nsubsequent soldiering, Farquhar was so closely to follow.\r\n\r\nPope, and a gentler observer, Steele, found Farquhar’s dialogue “low,”\r\nand so it must have sounded between the brave surviving extravagances\r\nof the Jacobean buskin and the modulated utterances of _Cato_ and _The\r\nRevenge_. A practical talent like Farquhar’s was bound to provoke hard\r\nlittle words from the Popes who shrank from his spontaneous style,\r\nand the Steeles who could not approve of the gross themes he had\r\ninherited. For sheer good-breeding, some scenes in _The Way of the\r\nWorld_ can never be surpassed; they prove that one cannot hold the\r\nstage by talk alone. It is fortunate for Farquhar that he could not\r\nemulate the exquisitely civilized depravities of Congreve’s urban Muse.\r\nBut his dialogue is not “low” to modern tastes; it has, in general, a\r\nsimple, natural zest, infinitely preferable to the Persian apparatus\r\nof the early eighteenth century. Even he, however, can rant and\r\ndeviate into rhetoric, as soon as his lovers drop upon one knee. More\r\nplainly in Farquhar’s work than in that of any contemporary, we mark\r\nthe glamour of the Caroline literature fading, and the breath of life\r\nblowing in. An essentially Protestant nationalism began to settle down\r\nupon England for good and all with William and Mary, and it brought\r\nsubtle changes to bear upon the arts, the trades, the sports, and\r\nthe manners of the people. In Farquhar’s comedies we have the reflex\r\nof a dulling and strengthening age; the fantasticalities of the last\r\nthree reigns are all but gone; the Vandyck dresses gleam and swish\r\nno longer. Speech becomes more pert and serviceable, in a vocabulary\r\nof lesser range; lives are vulgarizing, that is, humanizing, and\r\ngetting closer to common unromantic concerns; no such delicately unreal\r\ncreature as Millamant, all fire and dew and perfumery,—Millamant who\r\ncould not suffer to have her hair done up in papers written in prose,\r\nand who, quite by herself, is a vindication of what Mr. Allibone is\r\npleased to call “Lamb’s sophistical and mischievous essay,”—walks the\r\nworld of Farquhar. With him, notwithstanding that the sorry business\r\nto be despatched is the same old amorous intrigue, come in at once\r\nless license, less affectation, less Gallicism. He reports from the\r\nbeginning what he himself apprehends; his plays are shorthand notes,\r\nalbeit timid in character, upon the transitional and prosaic time. His\r\ncompany is made up of individuals he had seen in a thousand lights at\r\nthe Spread Eagle and the Rummer; in the Inner Temple and in St. James’s\r\nPark; in barracks domestic and foreign; and in his native place, where\r\nadventurers, eloquent in purest Londonderry,[41] stumbled along\r\nfull of whiskey and ideas. He anticipates certain phases of Private\r\nOrtheris’s thorough-going love of London, and figures his exiled Dicky\r\nas “just dead of a consumption, till the sweet smoke of Cheapside\r\nand the dear perfume of Fleet-ditch” made him a man again. In this\r\nlaughing affectionate apprehension of the local and the temporal\r\nlies Farquhar’s whole strength or weakness. From the poets of the\r\nRestoration there escapes, most incongruously, now and then, something\r\nwhich betokens a sense of natural beauty, or even a recognition of the\r\ndivine law; but Farquhar is not a poet, and this spray from the deeps\r\nis not in him. He perceives nothing that is not, and opens no crack or\r\nchink where the fancy can air itself for a moment and\r\n\r\n    —“step grandly out into the infinite.”\r\n\r\nSuch a lack would not be worth remarking in the debased and insincere\r\nwriters who but just preceded him. But from the very date of his\r\nfirst dealings with London managers, idealism was abroad, and a man\r\nwith affinities for “the things that are more excellent” need have\r\nfeared no longer to divulge them, since the court and the people, if\r\nnot the dominant town gentry, were with him. Farquhar had neither the\r\nfull moral illumination nor the will, though he had the capacity,\r\nto lend a hand to the blessed work waiting for the opportunist. He\r\nwas young, he was of provincial nurture; he was carried away by the\r\ntheatrical tradition. Yet his mind was a Medea’s kettle, out of which\r\neverything issued cleaner and more wholesome. Despite the prodigious\r\nanimal spirits of his characters, they conduct their mad concerns with\r\nsense and moderation; they manage tacitly to proclaim themselves as\r\ntemporarily “on a tear,” as going forth to angle in angling weather,\r\nand as likely to lead sober citizen lives from to-morrow on. Under bad\r\nold maintained conditions they develop traits approximately worthy of\r\nthe _Christian Hero_. They “look before and after.” They are to be\r\nclassed as neutrals and nondescripts, for they have all the swagger\r\nof their lax progenitors, and none of their deviltry. They belong\r\nprofessionally to one family, while they bear a tantalizing resemblance\r\nto another. Farquhar himself, perhaps unaware that partisanship is\r\nbetter than compromise, made his bold toss for bays both spiritual\r\nand temporal. Imitating, as novices will ever do, the art back of\r\nhim, he adopted the claim to approbation which that art never dreamed\r\nof. In the very good preface to _The Twin Rivals_ (which has always\r\nbeen approved of critics rather than of audiences), he sets up for a\r\ncastigator of vice and folly, and he offers to appease “the ladies and\r\nthe clergy,” as, in some measure apparent to the more metaphysical\r\namong them, he may have done. His friend, Mr. John Hopkins, the\r\nauthor of _Amasia_, invited, on behalf of _The Constant Couple_, the\r\ncommendation of Collier. That open-minded censor may have seen with\r\nsatisfaction, in the general trend of Farquhar’s composition, the less\r\nand less dubious day-beams of Augustan decency. Though Farquhar did not\r\nlive, like Vanbrugh and the magnanimous Dryden, to admit the abuse of a\r\ngift, and to deplore it, he alone, of the minor dramatists, seems all\r\nalong to have had a negative sort of conscience better than none. His\r\ninstincts continually get the better not only of his environment, but\r\nof his practice. Some uneasiness, some misgiving, are at the bottom of\r\nhis homely materialism. He thinks it best, on the whole, to forswear\r\nthe temptation to be sublime, and to keep to his cakes and ale; and\r\nfor cakes and ale he had an eminent and inborn talent. What was ably\r\nsaid of Hogarth, the great exemplar, will cover all practicians of his\r\nschool: “He had an intense feeling for and command over the impressions\r\nof senses and habit, of character and passion, the serious and the\r\ncomic; in a word, of nature as it fell in with his own observation, or\r\ncame into the sphere of his actual experience. But he had little power\r\nbeyond that sphere, or sympathy for that which existed only in idea. He\r\nwas ‘conformed to this world, not transformed.’” Or, as Leigh Hunt, in\r\nhis beautiful memoir, adds, with acuteness, of Farquhar himself: “He\r\ncould turn what he had experienced in common life to the best account,\r\nbut he required in all cases the support of ordinary associations, and\r\ncould not project his spirit beyond them.” In short, Farquhar lacked\r\nimagination. He had insight, however, of another order, which is\r\nhis praise, and which distinguishes him from all his fellows: he had\r\nsympathy and charity.\r\n\r\nThe major blot on the literature of the English stage of the period is\r\nnot its libertinism, but rather its concomitant utter heartlessness.\r\n“Arrogance” (so, according to Erasmus, that ascetic scholar Dean Colet\r\nused to remind his clergy) “is worse than a hundred concubines.” The\r\nslight sporadic touches of tenderness, of pity, of disinterested\r\ngenerosity, to be found by patient search in Congreve, come in boldly\r\nwith Farquhar, and boldly overrun his prompter’s books. Vanbrugh’s\r\nscenes stand on nothing but their biting and extravagant sarcasm. As\r\nCongreve’s characters are indiscriminately witty, so Vanbrugh’s are\r\nuniversally and wearisomely cynical, and at the expense of themselves\r\nand all society. His women in high life have no individuality; they\r\nwear stings of one pattern. The genial conception of the shrewd,\r\nmaterial Mrs. Amlet, however, in _The Confederacy_, is worthy of\r\nFarquhar, and certainly Congreve himself could not have bettered\r\nher in the execution. Etherege’s typical Man of Mode is a tissue\r\nof untruth, hardness, and scorn, all in impeccable attire; a most\r\nmournful spectacle. Thinking of such dainty monsters, Macaulay let fly\r\nhis famous invective against their creators: “Foreheads of bronze,\r\nhearts like the nether millstone, and tongues set on fire of hell!”\r\nGeorge Farquhar may be exempted altogether from this too-deserved\r\ncompliment. There is honest mirth in his world of fiction, there is\r\ndutifulness, there is true love, there are good women; there is genuine\r\nfriendship between Roebuck and Lovewell, between Trueman and Hermes\r\nWouldbe, between Aimwell and Archer, and between the green Tummas of\r\n_The Recruiting Officer_ and his Costar, whom he cannot leave behind.\r\nSylvia, Angelica, Constance, Leanthe, Oriana, Dorinda, free-spoken\r\nas they are, how they shine, and with what morning freshness, among\r\nthe tiger-lilies of that evil garden of the Restoration drama! These\r\nheroines are an innovation, for they are maids, not wedded wives.\r\nAs to the immortal periwigged young bloods their suitors, they are\r\n“real gentlemen,” as Hazlitt, who loved Farquhar, called them, “and\r\nonly pretended impostors;” or, to quote Farquhar’s latest editor, Mr.\r\nA. C. Ewald, they are “always men and never yahoos.” Their author\r\nhad no interest in “preferring vice, and rendering virtue dull and\r\ndespicable.” Their praise may be negative, but it establishes a wide\r\nwall of difference between them and the fops and cads with whom they\r\nhave been confounded. In their conversations, glistening with epigram\r\nand irony, malevolence has no part; they sneer at no virtue, they\r\ntamper with none; and at every turn of a selfish campaign they find\r\nopportunity for honorable behavior. From the mouths of these worldlings\r\ncomes satire, hot and piping, against worldliness; for Farquhar is\r\nas moralizing, if not as moral, as he dares be. Some of the least\r\nattractive of them, the most greedy and contriving, have moments of\r\nsweetly whimsical and optimistic speech. Thus Benjamin Wouldbe, the\r\nplotter against his elder brother in _The Twin Rivals_, makes his\r\nadieu after the fashion of a true gallant: “I scorn your beggarly\r\nbenevolence! Had my designs succeeded, I would not have allowed you the\r\nweight of a wafer, and therefore will accept none.” The same person\r\nsoars again into a fine Aurelian speculation: “Show me that proud stoic\r\nthat can bear success and champagne! Philosophy can support us in hard\r\nfortune, but who can have patience in prosperity?” Over his men and\r\nwomen in middle life Farquhar lingers with complacence entirely foreign\r\nto his colleagues, to whom mothers, guardians, husbands, and other\r\napple-guarding dragons were uniformly ridiculous and odious. Justice\r\nBalance is as attractive as a hearth-fire on a December night; so is\r\nLady Bountiful. Over Fairbank, the good goldsmith, Farquhar gets fairly\r\nsentimental, and permits him to drop unaware into decasyllabics, like\r\nthe pastoral author of _Lorna Doone_. His rogues are merely roguish,\r\nin the softened sense of the word; in his panorama, though black\r\nvillains come and go, it is only for an instant, and to further some\r\none dramatic effect. He has eulogy for his heroes when they deserve it,\r\nand when they do not you may trust him to find a compassionate excuse;\r\nas when poor Leanthe feelingly says of her lover that “his follies are\r\nweakly founded upon the principles of honor, where the very foundation\r\nhelps to undermine the structure.” Even Squire Sullen, for his\r\nlumpishness, is divorced without derision, and in a peal of harmless\r\nlaughter. Farquhar, indeed, is all gentleness, all kindness. He had the\r\npensive attitude of the true humorist towards the world he laughed at;\r\nhis characters let slip words too deep for their living auditors. It\r\nis curious that to a Restoration dramatist, “a nether millstone,” we\r\nshould owe a perfect brief description of ideal married life. In the\r\nscene of the fourth act of _Sir Harry Wildair_, where Lady Lurewell,\r\nwith her “petrifying affectation,” is trying to tease Sir Harry out\r\nof all endurance on the subject of his wife (whom he believes to be\r\nlost or dead), and the degree of affection he had for her, he makes\r\nreply: “My own heart whispered me her desires, ’cause she herself was\r\nthere; no contention ever rose but the dear strife of who should most\r\noblige—no noise about authority, for neither would stoop to command,\r\nwhere both thought it glory to obey.” This is meant to be spoken\r\nrapidly, and not without its tantalizing lack of emphasis; but what a\r\npearl it is, set there in the superlatively caustic dialogue! English\r\nchivalry and English literature have no such other golden passage in\r\ntheir rubrics, unless it be the famous tribute to the Lady Elizabeth\r\nHastings that “to love her was a liberal education,” or Lovelace’s\r\nunforgettable song:\r\n\r\n    “I could not love thee, dear, so much,\r\n     Loved I not Honour more!”\r\n\r\nThe passage takes on a very great accidental beauty when we remember\r\nthat it required courage, in its time and place, to have written it.\r\nIt is characteristic also of Farquhar that it should be introduced,\r\nas it is, on the top wave of a vivacious and stormy conversation,\r\nwhich immediately sweeps it under, as if in proof that he understood\r\nboth his art and his audience. The conjugal tie, among the leaders\r\nof fashion, was still something to laugh at and to toy with. Captain\r\nVanbrugh, from whom nobody need expect much edification, had put in the\r\nmouth of his Constant, in a play which was a favorite with Garrick,\r\na bit of sense and sincerity quoted, as it deserved to be, by Hunt:\r\n“Though marriage be a lottery in which there are a wondrous many\r\nblanks, yet there is one inestimable lot in which the only heaven on\r\nearth is written.” And again: “To be capable of loving one is better\r\nthan to possess a thousand.” This was in 1698, and Farquhar therefore\r\nwas not first, nor alone, in daring to speak for the derided idea of\r\nwedlock. Steele was soon to arise as the very champion of domestic\r\nlife; and English wit, since he wrote, has never subsisted by its\r\nmockery of the conditions which create\r\n\r\n    “home-keeping days and household reverences.”\r\n\r\nBut it was Farquhar who spoke in behalf of these the most memorable\r\nword of his generation. After that lofty evidence of what he must be\r\nsuspected to have been, it is well to see, as best we may, what manner\r\nof man George Farquhar was. And first let us take some extracts from\r\nhis own account of himself, “candid and modest,” as Hunt named it.\r\n\r\nHe gives us to understand that he had an ardent temperament, held in\r\ncheck by an introspective turn of thought, by natural bashfulness, and\r\nby habits of consideration for others. The portrait is drawn from a\r\nletter in the _Miscellanies_, of “a mind and person generally dressed\r\nin black,” and might have come bodily, and with charming grace, from\r\n_The Spectator_. “I have very little estate but what lies under the\r\ncircumference of my hat . . . and should I by misfortune come to lose\r\nmy head, I should not be worth a groat.” “I am seldom troubled by what\r\nthe world calls airs and caprices, and I think it an idiot’s excuse\r\nfor a foolish action to say: ‘’Twas my humor.’” “I cannot cheerfully\r\nfix to any study which bears not a pleasure in the application.”\r\n“Long expectation makes the blessing always less to me; I lose the\r\ngreat transport of surprise.” “I am a very great epicure; for which\r\nreason I hate all pleasure that’s purchased by excess of pain. I can’t\r\nrelish the jest that vexes another. In short, if ever I do a wilful\r\ninjury, it must be a very great one.” “I have many acquaintances, very\r\nfew intimates, but no friend; I mean, in the old romantic way.” “I\r\nhave no secret so weighty but that I can bear it in my own breast.”\r\n“I would have my passion, if not led, at least waited on by my\r\nreason.” This last text, repeated elsewhere by Farquhar, which is the\r\ncounterpart of one in Sir Philip Sidney’s _Arcadia_, has interest from\r\nthe lips of a child of the “dancing, drinking, and unthinking time.”\r\nFarquhar’s face, in the old prints, is wonderfully of a piece with\r\nthese amiable reports: a handsome, humane, careworn, melancholy young\r\nface, the negation of the contemporary idea of the man about town. His\r\nconstitution, at its best, was but frail. “You are as dear to me,” he\r\nsays, pathetically, to his Penelope, “as my hopes of waking in health\r\nto-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nA tradition has been received without question by his many critics and\r\nbiographers, that his chief characters, all cast in the same animated\r\nmould, are but incognitos of himself. Highly-colored projections of\r\nhimself, with latent traits exaggerated, and formed mental restraints\r\nremoved, they may indeed be. The public, which loves identifications,\r\ninsisted on finding him revealed in his Archers and Sir Harrys. Whether\r\nor not the dramatists of the day had universally the Rembrandtesque\r\nwhim of painting themselves into their own foregrounds, they were\r\nobstinately supposed to do so, with Etherege in Young Bellair, with\r\nOtway in Jaffier. But the real Farquhar\r\n\r\n                  —“courteous, facile, sweet,\r\n    Hating that solemn vice of greatness, pride,”\r\n\r\nwith his reserve, his simple dress, his thin, agreeable voice,\r\nhis early reputation at college for uncongeniality, acting in\r\nevery emergency whither we can fairly trace him with deliberate\r\nhigh-mindedness, is far enough from the temper of his restless and\r\njocund creations. He wished to remove the impression that he could have\r\nbeen his own model; for he took pains to inscribe _The Inconstant_ to\r\nhis classmate, Richard Tighe, and to compliment him upon his kinship\r\nwith Mirabel, “a gay, splendid, easy, generous, fine young gentleman”;\r\nthe applauded type, in short, of all that Farquhar’s heroes set out to\r\nbe. Again, lest he should pass for a realist as rabid as Mademoiselle\r\nde Scudéry, who pinioned three hundred and seventy of her acquaintances\r\nbetween the covers of _Clélie_, Farquhar adds this warning to his\r\nenthusiastic dedication of _The Recruiting Officer_ “to all friends\r\nround the Wrekin”: “Some little turns of humor that I met with almost\r\nwithin the shade of that famous hill gave the rise to this comedy;\r\nand people were apprehensive that, by the example of some others, I\r\nwould make the town merry at the expense of the country gentleman. But\r\nthey forgot that I was to write a comedy, not a libel.” He disclaims\r\neverywhere, with the same playful decisiveness, the interpretations put\r\nupon his designs and actions by the world of overgrown infants which he\r\nentertained. Endowed with courage and much personal charm, he had small\r\nchance of distinguishing himself upon the field, and for the most part\r\nshone at a garrison mess; but he had led a not inadventurous life, in\r\nwhich were incidents of the most pronounced melodrama, with a touch of\r\nmystery to enhance their value for the curious. Farquhar had travelled,\r\nand with an open, not an insular mind; he had, by his own confession,\r\ntoo deep an acquaintance with wine, and with the nightingales of Spring\r\nGardens, outsinging “the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow”; he had\r\nbeen, in short, though with “melancholy as his every-day apparel,”\r\nalive and abroad as a private Whig of the Revolution, shy of ladies’\r\nnotice till it came, and proud of it ever after. When he printed, in\r\nhis twenty-first year, _The Adventures of Covent Garden_, he added to\r\nit a boy’s bragging motto: _Et quorum pars magna fui_. The inference\r\nseems to have clung closer to him than he found comfortable. He\r\ncomplains, not without significance, in his prose essay upon the\r\ndrama, that the public think any rôle compounded of “practical rake\r\nand speculative gentleman is, ten to one, the author’s own character.”\r\nWith the incident which furnished its thrilling closing scenes to _The\r\nInconstant_, Farquhar had probably no connection; he takes pains to\r\nstate that the hero of it was the Chevalier de Chastillon, quite as if\r\nhe feared another confusion of himself, as fearless and quick-witted\r\na man, with the “golden swashbucklers” of his imagination. The rumor\r\nwhich confounded them with him has next to nothing to support it.\r\nFortune, fashion, foolhardiness, impudence, were not the stars which\r\nshone upon Farquhar’s nativity. Such exotic and epic virtues as may\r\nflourish under these, such as do adorn the delightful dandies he\r\ndepicted, surely belonged to him in person; and his quiet habit of\r\nliving apart and letting the town talk, fixed to perpetuity the belief\r\nthat he had exploited himself vicariously, for good and all, upon the\r\nstage. Certain qualities of his, certain brave truces established with\r\nadverse conditions, force one to consider him with more attention and\r\nrespect than even his brilliant pen invites. It is something to find\r\nhim diffident and studious in a bacchanalian society, and with such\r\nscrupulous sensitiveness that a mere inadvertence in boyhood forbade\r\nhim ever to fence again;[42] but his outstanding characteristic, the\r\nthing which sets him apart from his brocaded _dramatis personæ_, is his\r\nknown lasting devotion to the welfare of his family, and his admirable\r\nbehavior in relation to his early and extraordinary marriage.\r\n\r\nIn 1702, Farquhar issued a charming and little-known miscellany,\r\ncalled _Love and Business_, “a collection of occasionary verse and\r\nepistolary prose.” The poetic exercises are of small importance;\r\nbut the other data (which survive as a hindrance, rather than as a\r\nhelp, to biographers) come near being of very definite value. All\r\nmanner of futile guesses have been expended upon the identification\r\nof his Penelope. It is given to no mouser to name her with certainty;\r\nbut, despite the gossip of the greenroom, now as ever too ready to\r\nweave romances about the name of George Farquhar, internal evidence\r\nis strongly against her having been Anne Oldfield. Yet this is the\r\nsupposition of most of his editors. Commenting upon one passage\r\ntouching some villanous stratagem from which Farquhar says he was\r\nable to rescue a friend in the Low Countries, a friend with whom he\r\nafterwards condoles upon a robbery she had undergone, Leigh Hunt adds\r\nthat this may have been the woman whom Farquhar subsequently made his\r\nwife. A widow, whose Christian name was Margaret, but of whom we know\r\nso little else that we cannot say whether she was English, or whether\r\nher age considerably exceeded his, conceived a passionate attachment\r\nfor him, and managed to have it represented to him from several\r\nquarters not only that she was kindly disposed towards him, but that\r\nit would be well for his opening career if he should seek her hand,\r\nas she had estates and revenues. Eventually, after we know not what\r\nhesitations natural to a fastidious temperament, he proposed to her\r\nand was accepted, and it soon transpired that the bride was quite as\r\npenniless as himself. Hunt does not follow out his own hint in the\r\nmatter of the robbery, though the question, when carefully considered,\r\nhas a vital import. If the victim were indeed the lady whom Farquhar\r\nmarried later, and if she were indeed robbed, it should signify that\r\nshe must then have been possessed of some wealth, so that the report\r\ngiven to Farquhar could not have been, up to that time at least, a\r\nlie. On the other hand, casuists must decide whether, again in the\r\nevent of the victim having been correctly identified by Hunt, the\r\nrobbery itself may not have been an invention meant, after Farquhar had\r\ndeclared his allegiance, to quicken his sympathy, and to soften the\r\ncoming revelation that the robbery could never have resulted, owing to\r\na defect in the premises! There is very much else about the _Letters_\r\nwhich is confusing and inconsistent. They are so disconnected, and\r\nthey vary so in tone and manner, as to suggest a doubt whether, if not\r\naltogether imaginary, they could have been meant for any one person. A\r\nlady is announced as having returned them for publication; she dresses\r\nin mourning, and resides now on the Continent, now in London or in the\r\ncountry; her suitor very explicitly states that he had long solicited\r\nin vain the honor of her hand; and, in the end, with farewells and an\r\nabrupt and unexplained severing, he gives up the quest, with his own\r\nadmission that he has lost her and that her heart “had no room for\r\nhim.” Now that the recipient of this correspondence, Anne Oldfield\r\nor another, should have returned it for commercial purposes, not\r\nhaving been won by the very real passion exhibited in parts of it,\r\nseems somewhat peculiar; but to accept as fact that Farquhar himself\r\nactually asked these letters back from her, and printed them as they\r\nstood, is, under the conditions, absurd, and irreconcilable with\r\nour knowledge of his character from other and prior sources. Hunt\r\nfurther suggests that the _Miscellany_ was gathered together in some\r\npress of pecuniary trouble; and its title, indeed, may hint at a\r\nwhimsical expectation that Love, being harnessed and sent abroad to\r\narouse curiosity among readers, may return in the way of Business to\r\nheadquarters. But Farquhar, in his bachelor days, had a fair income,\r\nand would not have been so likely to hear the wolf at the door as he\r\nwas later, when that sound would awake in him a dread not ominous to\r\nhimself alone. It is possible that the undiscovered register of his\r\nmarriage bears the date of 1702 or even of 1701; if it were so, that\r\nmight explain the issue of his only book not in dramatic dress, and the\r\nemergency which called it forth. It is difficult indeed to suppose,\r\nalthough modern delicacy in these matters was just then a somewhat\r\nunknown quantity, that we have between its covers genuine love-letters\r\nhot from the pen. Steele, of an August morning nine years later,\r\ninserted in _The Spectator_ as the communication of a third person, six\r\nof his own notes to his comely and noble _fiancée_, Mary Scurlock. But\r\nFarquhar had not Steele’s earnestness and love of circumstantial truth,\r\nnor his zest for pointing a moral. Or was this publication the sort of\r\nthing he would be likely, for a not unworthy purpose, to do? Was he,\r\nin reality, a shade more obtuse and misguided than Miss Fanny Brawne?\r\nRather let us believe the _Letters_ a work of fiction, and only founded\r\nlargely upon various bygone moods and incidents of the foregoing two\r\nyears, which for one reason or another might interest buyers. Such is\r\nthe description to “dear Sam” of Dryden’s erratic funeral, which is\r\nalmost too keenly rhetorical a summing-up to have been written the next\r\nday, or the thoughtful and sensible surveys of the Dutch. The amatory\r\nepistles, with their leaven of reality, are presumably edited out of\r\nall recognition. They make no defined impression; they do not move\r\nforward; they veil impenetrably the traits of the person addressed, who\r\nis made to appear as a vanishing unrelenting goddess, deaf and blind to\r\nGeorge Farquhar pleading his best. Whatever were the facts, the report\r\nof them is chivalrous. Assume for a moment that his wife stands behind\r\nthe whole of this correspondence, or even behind the latter part of\r\nit, and what seemed to constitute a little betrayal in the very worst\r\ntaste turns out to be an innocent joke. Of course the “lady” (or one of\r\nthe ladies) lent the manuscripts to the printers; of course Farquhar\r\noriginated, in order to give color to Mistress Farquhar’s known\r\npretence of riches, and their joint subsequent poverty, the magnificent\r\nthieving practised upon the never-thieved and the unthievable! One can\r\nfancy them both, in their hard chairs in the bare room, laughing well\r\nand long, between tears of anxious hope that the more personal element\r\nin the _Miscellany_ might fetch them from the Covent Garden book-stalls\r\na parcel of fagots and a dinner.\r\n\r\nAside from all theorizing, it is pleasant to know that their life\r\ntogether was a happy one. The consensus of all witnesses, in the\r\nsignificant absence of any contrary voice, affirms that Farquhar,\r\nhaving been trapped, bore himself like the gentleman he was. Two\r\nchildren were born to him, to brighten, but also to sadden, his brief\r\nand diligent life. Under his added anxieties he did his royal best; he\r\naddressed to their mother, from first to last, no word of reproach for\r\nher fraud.\r\n\r\n    “The secret pleasure of the generous act\r\n     Is the great mind’s great bribe.”\r\n\r\nIn its fragrance of faith and patience and self-sacrificing tenderness,\r\ntheir domestic story can almost rank next after that sacred one of\r\nCharles and Mary Lamb.\r\n\r\nFarquhar’s widow, who had loved him, appears to have loved his\r\nmemory.[43] She did not survive her husband many years; for there is\r\nreason to suppose she died before 1719, and in penury. Poor Farquhar\r\nused to declare that the dread that his family might suffer want was\r\nfar more bitter to him than death. Wilkes gave at his theatre, in the\r\nMay of 1708, a benefit for Margaret Farquhar, and twelve years later\r\nhe was acting as trustee for the young girls Mary and Anne Margaret,\r\nwhose pension is said by the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ to have amounted\r\nto thirty pounds; it was obtained through the exertions of Edmund\r\nChalloner, to whom their father had dedicated his _Miscellanies_.\r\nWilkes seems to have again aided both the orphans when they came of\r\nage. One of them married an humble tradesman, and died early; the\r\nother was living in 1764, wholly uneducated, and, as it is said on\r\nsmall authority, as a maid-servant. Farquhar’s elder biographers\r\nand editors, Ware, Genest, Chetwood, and the rest, writing in this\r\ndaughter’s lifetime, were apparently unconscious of her existence; but\r\nthe thought of her father’s child, old, neglected, and in a menial\r\nposition, served to anger Leigh Hunt as late as 1842.\r\n\r\nFear and forecast of what is only too likely to befall the helpless,\r\ndepressed Farquhar in the April long ago, when he lay dying of\r\nconsumption, and when, with a fortitude which sustained him under\r\nhis bitter disappointment, for six weeks, he wrote and finished his\r\nmasterly comedy _The Beaux’ Stratagem_. As he drew near the end of the\r\nsecond act he was told to give up hope; but the second act closes with\r\nthe famous rattling catechism between Cherry and Archer, and the best\r\nbit of verse its author ever made; and the third starts in with the\r\nhearty sweet laugh—Anne Oldfield’s laugh—of that “exquisite creature,\r\nMrs. Sullen.” On a fund of grief, Farquhar enriched his London with a\r\nlegacy of perpetual merriment. The unflagging impetus of his dramas,\r\nabove and beyond their very real intrinsic merit, accounts for their\r\ngreat and yet unforfeited popularity. They descend to us associated\r\nwith the intellectual triumphs of the most dear and dazzling names\r\nupon the English stage; they move upon the wings of intelligence\r\nand good-nature; they “give delight, and hurt not.” They swarm with\r\nsoldiers, welcome figures long tacitly prohibited from the boards, as\r\ntoo painful a reminder of the Civil Wars. They begin with the clatter\r\nof spurs, the bang of doors, the hubbub of bantering voices in “a\r\nbroadside of damme’s.” Sergeant Kite appears, followed by a mob on\r\nwhom he lavishes his wheedling, inspiriting gibble-gabble; Roebuck\r\nenters in fantastic colloquy with a beggar; Sir Harry crosses the road,\r\nsinging, with footmen after him, and Vizard meanwhile indicating him\r\nto Standard as “the joy of the playhouse and the life of the park,\r\nSir Harry Wildair, newly come from Paris”; _The Twin Rivals_ opens\r\nin a volley of epigrams; the rise of the curtain in _The Beaux’\r\nStratagem_ discloses sly old Boniface and the ingenious Cherry calling\r\nand running, running and calling, in a fluster pregnant of farce and\r\nrevel. Farquhar’s pages are not for the closet; they have little\r\npassive charm; to quote from them, full as they are of familiar saws\r\nalmost all his own, is hardly fair. His mother-wit arises from the\r\nludicrous and unforeseen predicament, not from vanity and conscious\r\npower; it is integral, not mere repartee; and it never calls a halt to\r\nthe action. As was well said by Charles Cowden Clarke, “there are no\r\ntraps for jests” in Farquhar; “no trains laid to fire _équivoque_.” The\r\nclear fun, spurting unannounced in dialogue after dialogue, in incident\r\nafter incident; the incessant Molière-like masquerades; the thousand\r\nlittle issues depending upon by-play and transient inspiration; the\r\nnarrowing scope and deepening sentiment of the plot, like a secret\r\ngiven to the players, to be told fully only to the audience most in\r\ntouch with them—these commend Farquhar’s vivacious rôles to actors, and\r\nmake them both difficult and desirable. With what unction, from an\r\nactor’s lips, falls his manifold and glowing praise of theatres! What\r\na pretty picture, a broad wash of rose-purple and white, he can make\r\nof the interior seen from the wings! “There’s such a hurry of pleasure\r\nto transport us; the bustle, noise, gallantry, equipage, garters,\r\nfeathers, wigs, bows, smiles, ogles, love, music, and applause!” And\r\nagain, in another mood: “The playhouse is the element of poetry,\r\nbecause the region of beauty; the ladies, methinks, have a more\r\ninspiring, triumphant air in the boxes than anywhere else. They sit\r\ncommanding on their thrones, with all their subject slaves about them;\r\ntheir best clothes, best looks; shining jewels, sparkling eyes; the\r\ntreasures of the world in a ring.” And Mirabel, who is speaking, ends\r\nwith an ecstatic sigh: “I could wish that my whole life long were the\r\nfirst night of a new play!”\r\n\r\nThis is a drop, or a rise, from Congreve and his aristocratic\r\nabstractions. Farquhar, in his youth, had modelled himself chiefly\r\nupon the comedy of Congreve, and may be said to have perfected the\r\nmechanism which the genius of Congreve had brought into vogue. He never\r\nattained, nor could attain, Congreve’s scholarly elegance of proportion\r\nand his consummate diction. But he had the happiness of being no purely\r\nliterary dramatist; he had technical knowledge and skill. He brought\r\nthe existing heroes with their conniving valets, the buxom equivocal\r\nmaids, the laughing, masking, conscienceless fine ladies, out of their\r\ndisreputable moonlight into healthful comic air; and added to them, in\r\nthe transfer, a leaven of homely lovableness which will forever keep\r\nhis masterpieces upon the stage.\r\n\r\nFarquhar’s original intellect has a value only relative; he may be\r\nconsidered as Goldsmith’s tutor rather than as Congreve’s disciple.\r\nGoldsmith had no small knowledge of Farquhar, his forerunner by sixty\r\nyears as a sizar student of Trinity; and, like him, he is reported\r\nto have been dropped from his class for a buffoonery. What friends\r\n(_Arcades ambo_, in both Virgilian and blameless Byronese) might\r\nthese two parsons’ sons have been! Scrub, Squire Sullen’s servant,\r\nin _The Beaux’ Stratagem_, who “on Saturday draws warrants, and on\r\nSunday draws beer,” was a part Goldy once greatly desired to act. He,\r\ntoo, when he came to write plays, cast about for conventional types\r\nto handle and improve. Tony and his incomparable mother would hardly\r\nhave been, without their first imperfect apparition in Wycherley’s\r\npowerful (and stolen) _Plain Dealer_; and Young Marlow and Hastings\r\nare frank reproductions of Archer and Aimwell, in a much finer\r\nsituation. Miss Hardcastle hopes that in her cap and apron she may\r\nresemble Cherry. And no one seems to have traced a celebrated passage\r\nin _The Vicar of Wakefield_ either to my Lady Howdye’s message to my\r\nLady Allnight repeated by Archer (who in this same scene introduces\r\nthe “topical song” upon the modern boards), or else to the example\r\nof the manœuvring Bisarre in Act II., Scene I., of _The Inconstant_.\r\nSurely, “forms which proceed from simple enumeration and are exposed to\r\nvalidity from a contradictory instance” supplies the unique original\r\nof the nonsense-rhetoric which so confounded poor Moses.[44] The talk\r\nof Clincher Junior and Tim, of Kite, Bullock, Scrub, Lyric, and the\r\nunbaptized wench Parly, of the constable showing the big bed to Hermes\r\nWouldbe, the talk, that is, of Farquhar’s common people, shows humor\r\naltogether of what we may call the Goldsmith order: genial, odd,\r\ngrotesque paradox, springing from Irish inconsequence and love of human\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth year of Queen Anne, when Farquhar died, Steele was married\r\nto his “Prue,” and having seen the last of his three reformatory\r\ndramas “damned for its piety,” sought Joseph Addison’s approval and\r\ncollaboration, and fell to designing _The Tatler_. Fielding was\r\nnewborn, Johnson just out of the cradle, Pope was trying a cunning\r\nyoung hand at his first _Pastorals_; Defoe, an alumnus of Newgate, was\r\nbeating his way outward and upward; Swift, yet a Whig, was known but\r\nfor his _Tale of a Tub_. The fresh waters were rising on all sides to\r\nvivify the sick lowlands of the decadence. The kingdoms had a forgotten\r\nlesson, and long in the learning, set before them: to regain, as a\r\nbasis for legitimate results, their mental independence and simplicity;\r\nto serve art for art’s sake, and to achieve, through the reactionary\r\nformalism of the nascent eighteenth century, freedom and a broad ethic\r\noutlook. It was as if Comedy, in her winning meretricious perfections,\r\nhad to die, that English prose might live. It is enough for an immature\r\ngenius of the third order, born under Charles the Second, to have\r\nvaguely foreshadowed a just and imperative change. Farquhar certainly\r\ndoes foreshadow it, albeit with what theologians might call absence of\r\nthe necessary intention.\r\n\r\nHe wrote excellent prefaces and prologues. His _Discourse upon Comedy_,\r\nin the _Miscellanies_, did pioneer work for his theory, since\r\nexpounded by more authoritative critics, and received by the English\r\nworld, that the observance or non-observance of the dramatic unities\r\nis at the will of the wise, and that for guidance in all such matters\r\nplaywrights should look to Shakespeare rather than to Aristotle. The\r\n_Discourse_, in Farquhar’s clear, sunny, homespun, forceful style,\r\ndoes him honor, and should be reprinted. His best charm is that he\r\ncannot be didactic. His suasion is of the strongest, but he has the\r\nself-consciousness of all sensitive and analytic minds, which keeps\r\nhim free here as elsewhere from the slightest assumption of despotism.\r\nIt is very refreshing, in the face of that incessant belaboring of\r\nthe reader which Lesage was setting as a contemporaneous fashion, to\r\ncome across Farquhar’s gentle good-humored salutatory: “If you like\r\nthe author’s book, you have all the sense he thought you had; if you\r\ndislike it, you have more sense than he was aware of!” Had he lived\r\nlonger, or a little later, we should have found him as well, with his\r\nturn for skirmishing psychology, among the essayists and the novelists.\r\nThere were in him a mellowness and an unction which have their fullest\r\nplay in professedly subjective writing. Farquhar, after all, did not\r\nfulfil himself, for he followed an ill outgoing fashion in æsthetics\r\nrather than further a right incoming one. No one can help begrudging\r\nhim to the period he adorned. He deserved to flourish on the manlier\r\nmorrow, and to hold a historic position with the regenerators of public\r\ntaste in England. “Ah, go hang thyself up, my brave Crillon, for at\r\nArques we had a fight, and thou wert NOT in it!” One can fancy Sir\r\nRichard Steele forever quoting that at Captain George Farquhar, in some\r\nroomy club-window in Paradise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Incipit Annus Academicus Die Julii 9^a 1694.\r\n\r\n------+---------+----------+-----+-----------+------------+----------+\r\nDie |Georgius | filius | | Natus | ibidem | Eu.

John Farquhar, prebendary of\r\nRaphoe. We hear nothing more, ever after, of the Farquhar family, who\r\nhenceforth leave young George to his own profane devices; nor can any\r\ncertainty be attached to additional information, sometimes proffered,\r\nthat the father had seven children in all, and held a living of only\r\none hundred and fifty pounds a year. One other point is fixed by the\r\nentry, to wit: if George Farquhar was seventeen in the July of 1694, he\r\ncannot have been born in 1678.\r\n\r\n[38] This was the theatre built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1672.\r\n\r\n[39] Peter Anthony Motteux, the wild and clever linguist and dramatist,\r\nwho made the best English translation of _Don Quixote_. _The Stage\r\nCoach_, itself an adaptation, has little merit beyond its liveliness.\r\n\r\n[40] The register of burial is dated a month later than the received\r\ndate of his death. It reads simply: “23 May, George Falkwere, M.” The\r\ninitial is the sapient sexton’s indication that this was neither a W\r\n(woman) nor a C (child). The spelling of the name betokens its usual\r\nand original pronunciation. The present famous porticoed church was not\r\nbuilt for nineteen years after Farquhar died.\r\n\r\n[41] The not altogether foolish censure has been cast upon the rogue\r\nTeague in _The Twin Rivals_ that he speaks an impossible brogue, which\r\nmight as well be Welsh. Farquhar did not succeed in transferring to\r\npaper the weird and unlovely Ulster dialect with which he was familiar\r\nin boyhood, and which had figured already in the third act of _Henry\r\nthe Fifth_, in Jonson’s Irish masque, in Shadwell’s _Lancashire\r\nWitches_; which was simultaneously being used in his farce _The\r\nCommittee_, by Dryden’s friend Howard, and which was afterwards to have\r\ngood corroboration in Aytoun’s _Massacre of the MacPherson_. Farquhar\r\nemploys it twice elsewhere, passably well in the case of Torlough\r\nMacahone of the parish of Curroughabegley (the personage who built a\r\nmansion-house for himself and his predecessors after him), and with\r\nlamentable flatness in that of Dugard in his last comedy. Dugard is a\r\nrival of the nursery-maid dear to almanac humorists, who is wont to\r\nexclaim: “Can’t ye tell boi me accint that ’tis Frinch Oi am!” It was\r\none of Farquhar’s inartistic mistakes that he made no loving study of\r\nthis or of anything touching nearly his own people. His Irishmen, with\r\nthe exception of Roebuck, are either rascals or characterless nobodies.\r\nThe name Teague, or Teig, which Howard had also employed, is old and\r\npure North Irish; and no less pleasant an authority than George Borrow\r\nreminds us in the _Romano Lavo-Lil_ that it is Danish in origin.\r\n\r\n[42] Dear Dick Steele, in 1701, while Captain of Fusileers, had a\r\nduel thrust upon him; and in parrying, his sword pierced his man. To\r\nhis remorse may be ascribed his hatred of the custom of duelling,\r\nexpressed afterwards on every occasion. Steele owed his start in life\r\nto James Butler, Duke of Ormonde, who entered him among the boys on\r\nthe Charterhouse foundation. This peer was grandfather to the man who\r\nfailed George Farquhar.\r\n\r\n[43] Mrs. Farquhar published in 1711 an octavo volume of the _Plays,\r\nLetters, and Verses_. Among the verses figures a poem of six cantos\r\ndedicated to the victorious Earl of Peterborough, entitled _Barcelona_.\r\n“It was found among my dear deceased husband’s writings,” says the\r\nwidow, in her prefatory note. He was not at the siege, and it is\r\npossible that the six cantos were a manuscript copy of the effusion of\r\nsome former comrade. Farquhar was the author of several songs, one, of\r\nhighly didactic complexion, having emanated from him at the reputed age\r\nof ten. Of these, only two are of fair lyrical quality: the page’s song\r\nin _Love and a Bottle_, and “Tell me, Aurelia, tell me, pray,” which\r\nRobert Southey included in his collection.\r\n\r\n[44] _The Vicar of Wakefield_ dates from 1766. Almost twenty years\r\nbefore that, the immortal Partridge had remarked to Tom Jones, quoting\r\nhis schoolmaster: “Polly matete cry town is my daskalon.” Noble\r\nnonsense hath her pedigree. Goldsmith, however, is not so likely to\r\nhave taken his cue from Fielding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTOPHAM BEAUCLERK\r\n\r\n1739-1780\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nBENNET LANGTON\r\n\r\n1741-1800\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Samuel Johnson’s famous circle nearly every man stands for himself,\r\nfull of definite purpose and power. But two young men are there who\r\ndid nothing of moment, whose names chime often down the pages of all\r\nhis biographies, and to whom the world must pay honor, if only for\r\nthe friendship they took and gave. As Apollo should be set about with\r\nhis Graces “tripping neatly,” so the portentous old apparition of\r\nJohnson seems never so complete and endearing as when attended by these\r\ntwo above all things else Johnsonians. When the Turk’s Head is ajar\r\nin Gerrard Street, in shadow-London; when the “unclubable” Hawkins\r\nstrides over the threshold, and Hogarth goes by the window with his\r\nlarge nod and smile; when Chamier is there reading, Goldsmith posing\r\nin purple silk small-clothes, Sir Joshua fingering his trumpet, Burke\r\nand little brisk Garrick stirring “bishop”[45] in their glasses, and\r\nthe king of the hour, distinguished by his lack of ruffles, is rolling\r\nabout in his chair of state, saying something prodigiously humorous\r\nand wise, it is still Bennet Langton and Topham Beauclerk who most\r\ngive the scene its human genial lustre, standing with laughter behind\r\nhim, arm in arm. They were his favorites, and it is the most adorable\r\nthing about them both that they made out to like James Boswell, who\r\nwas jealous of them. (Perhaps they had apprehended thoroughly Newman’s\r\nfine aphorism concerning a bore: “You may yield, or you may flee: you\r\ncannot conquer!”) The rare glimpses we have of their brotherly lives is\r\nthrough the door which opens or shuts for Johnson. Between him and them\r\nwas deep and enduring affection, and what little is known of them has\r\na right to be more, for his sake.\r\n\r\nBennet Langton, born in 1741 in the very neighborhood famous now as the\r\nbirthplace of Tennyson, was the elder son of the odd and long-descended\r\nGeorge Langton of Langton, and of Diana his wife, daughter of Edmund\r\nTurnor, Esquire, of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire. While a lad in the\r\nfen-country, he read _The Rambler_, and conceived the purest enthusiasm\r\nfor its author. He came to London, indeed, on the ideal errand of\r\nseeking him out, and, thanks to the kind apothecary Levett, found the\r\nidol of his imagination at home at No. 17 Gough Square, Fleet Street.\r\nDespite the somewhat staggering circumstances of Johnson’s attire,—for\r\nthe serious boy had rashly presupposed a stately, fastidious, and\r\nwell-mannered figure,—he paid his vows, and commended himself to\r\nhis new friend for once and all. Langton entered Trinity College,\r\nOxford, in 1757, at the age of sixteen.[46] The Doctor, who had\r\nknown him about three years, followed his career at the university\r\nwith interest, writing to Langton’s tutor, then “dear Tom Warton,”\r\njust appointed to the professorship of poetry held by his father, and\r\nafterwards poet-laureate: “I see your pupil: his mind is as exalted\r\nas his stature,” and to Langton’s self the sweet generality: “I love,\r\ndear sir, to think of you.” He even paid his Freshman a visit, and\r\nswam sportively across a dangerous pool in the Isis, in the teeth of\r\nhis warning; and here also, in the Oxford which was long ago his own\r\n“tent of a night,” he fell across a part of his destiny in the shape\r\nof that strange bird, Mr. Topham Beauclerk, then a taking scapegrace\r\nof eighteen. The Doctor must have shaken his head at first, and\r\nwondered at the juxtaposition of this arrant Lord of Misrule and the\r\n“evangelical goodness” of his admirable Langton, until mollified by\r\nthe knowledge that a species of cult for himself, and ardent perusal\r\nof his writings, had first brought them together. It was a pleasant\r\nthought to him, that of the two young ribboned heads high in the\r\nquadrangle, bending for the ninth time over _The Reasons Why Advice is\r\nGenerally Ineffectual_, _The Mischief of Unbounded Raillery_, and the\r\njolly satire on _Screech-Owls_; or smiling over the shy Verecundulus\r\nand the too-celebrated Misellus who were part of the author’s machinery\r\nfor adding “Christian ardor to virtue, and Christian confidence to\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nBeauclerk, like Langton, was a critic and a student; he was well-bred,\r\nurbane, and of excellent natural parts; moreover, he was a wit, one\r\nof the very foremost of his day, when wits grew in every garden. An\r\nonly child, he was born in London in the December of 1739, and named\r\nafter that benevolent Topham of Windsor who left the manors of Clewer\r\nBrocas and Didworth and a collection of paintings and drawings to his\r\nfather, the handsome wild Lord Sydney Beauclerk, fifth son of the\r\nfirst Duke of St. Albans, and also, in his time, a gentleman commoner\r\nof Trinity. Lord Sydney died early, in the autumn of 1744, and was\r\nburied in Westminster Abbey with his hero-brother Aubrey, whose\r\nepitaph, still to be read there, Thomson seems to have written. All\r\nthe pretty toys and curios passed to Topham the little boy, under the\r\nguardianship of Lady Beauclerk, his excellent but literal mother, once\r\nMary Norris of Speke in Lancashire. His tutor was named Parker, and\r\nmust have been a much-enduring man. Young Beauclerk grew up, bearing\r\na resemblance in many ways to Charles II.; and so it befell that with\r\nhis aggravating flippancy, his sharp sense, his quiver full of gibes,\r\nhis time-wasting, money-wasting moods, foreign as Satan and his pomps\r\nto those of his sweet-natured college companion, he was able to strike\r\nDr. Johnson in his own political weak spot. A flash of the liquid\r\nStuart eye was enough to disarm Johnson at the very moment when he was\r\ncalling up his most austere frown; it was enough to turn the vinegar\r\nof his wrath to the honey of kindness. _Il ne nous reste qu’une chose\r\nà faire: embrassons-nous!_ as the wheedling Prince, at a crisis,\r\nsays to Henry Esmond. Johnson, as everybody knows, was a Jacobite.\r\nNo sincerer testimony could he have given to his inexplicable liking\r\nfor a royal rogue than that he allowed Nell Gwynn’s great-grandson to\r\ntease him and tyrannize over him during an entire lifetime. A choice\r\nspectacle this: Mr. Topham Beauclerk, on his introduction, literally\r\nbewitching Dr. Samuel Johnson! The stolid moralist was enraptured\r\nwith his Jack-o’-lantern antics; he rejoiced in his manners, his\r\ntaste and literary learning; admired him indiscreetly, rich clothes,\r\nequipage, and all; followed his whims meekly, expostulated with him\r\nalmost against his traitorous impulses, and clung to him to the end in\r\nunbroken fondness and faith.\r\n\r\nBeauclerk had immense gayety and grace, and the full force given by\r\nhigh spirits. His accurate, ever-widening knowledge of books and men,\r\nhis consummate culture, and his fearlessness, sat handsomely on one\r\nwho was regarded by contemporary old ladies as a mere “macaroni.” It\r\nwas a matter of course that he tried for no degree at college. The\r\nmistress of Streatham Park, who was by no means his adorer, and who\r\nremembered his chief wickedness in remembering that “he wished to be\r\naccounted wicked,” informs us in a private jotting since published\r\nthat he was “a man of very strict veracity.” A philosopher and a\r\ntruth-teller, whatever his worldly weaknesses, was sure to be a\r\ncharacter within the range of Johnson’s affections. It was he who most\r\ntroubled the good Doctor, he for whom he suffered in silence, with whom\r\nhe wrangled; he whose insuperable taunting promise, never reaching any\r\nspecial development, vexed and disheartened him; yet, perhaps because\r\nof these very things, though Bennet Langton was infinitely more to his\r\nmind, it was Absalom, once again, whom the old fatherly heart loved\r\nbest. Nor was he unrepaid. None loved him better, in return, than his\r\n“Beau,” the very mirror of the name, who was wont to pick his way up\r\nthe grimy Fleet Street courts “with veneration,” as Boswell records.\r\n\r\nBennet Langton, as Mr. Forster expresses it in his noble _Life of\r\nGoldsmith_, was “an eminent example of the high and humane class who\r\nare content to ‘ring the bell’ to their friends.” He was a mild young\r\nvisionary, scrupulous, tolerant, and generous in the extreme; modest,\r\ncontemplative, averse to dissipation; a perfect talker and reader,\r\nand a perfect listener; with a face sweet as a child’s, fading but\r\nnow, among his kindred, on the canvas of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He left\r\na gracious memory behind at Oxford, where his musing bust adorns the\r\nold monastic library of Trinity. He was six feet six inches tall,\r\nslenderly built, and slightly stooping. “The ladies got about him in\r\ndrawing-rooms,” said Edmund Burke, “like maids about the Maypole!”\r\n\r\nMiss Hawkins, in her _Memoirs_, names him as the person with whom\r\nJohnson was certainly seen to the fairest advantage. His deferent\r\nsuave manner was the best foil possible to the Doctor’s extraordinary\r\nexplosions. He had supreme self-command; no one ever saw him angry;\r\nand in most matters of life, as a genuine contrast to his beloved\r\nfriend Beauclerk, he was apt to take things a shade too seriously. We\r\nlearn from Mr. Henry Best, author of some good _Personal and Literary\r\nMemorials_, that the advance rumors of the French Revolution found\r\nLangton, in the fullest sense, an aristocrat; but it was not long\r\nbefore he became, from conviction, a thorough Liberal, and so remained,\r\nalthough he suffered a great unpopularity, owing to this change, in\r\nhis native county. He wrote, in 1760, a little book of essays entitled\r\n_Rustics_, which never got beyond the passivity of manuscript. The\r\nyear before, under the date of July 28th, Langton contributed to the\r\npages of _The Idler_ the paper numbered 67 and entitled _A Scholar’s\r\nJournal_. It is a pleasant study of procrastination and of shifting\r\nplans, a gentle bit of humor to be ranked as autobiographic. There is\r\nan indorsement of Montrose in its heroic advice to “risk the certainty\r\nof little for the chance of much.” But Langton’s graceful academic\r\npen was not destined to a public career. Perseverance of any sort was\r\nnot native to him. He fulfilled beautifully, adds the vivacious Miss\r\nHawkins, “the pious injunction of Sir Thomas Browne, ‘to sit quietly\r\nin the soft showers of Providence,’ and might, without injustice,\r\nbe characterized as utterly unfit for every species of activity.”\r\nYet at the call of duty, so well was the natural man dominated by\r\nhis unclouded will, he girded himself to any exertion. Wine-drinking\r\nwas habitual with him, and he felt its need to sharpen and rouse\r\nhis intellect; “but the idea of Bennet Langton being what is called\r\n‘overtaken,’” wrote the same associate whom we have been quoting, “is\r\ntoo preposterous to be dwelt on.” She furnishes one illustration of\r\nLangton’s Greek serenity. Talking to a company, of a chilly forenoon,\r\nin his own house, he paused to remark that if the fire lacked attention\r\nit might go out: a brief, casual, murmurous interruption. He resumed\r\nhis discourse, breaking off presently, and pleading abstractedly with\r\neye in air: “Pray ring for coals!” All sat looking at the fire, and\r\nso little solicitous about the impending catastrophe that presently\r\nLangton was off again on the stream of his softened eloquence. In a few\r\nminutes came another lull. “Did anybody answer that bell?” A general\r\nnegative. “Did anybody ring that bell?” A sly shaking of heads. And\r\nonce more the inspired monody soared among the clouds, at last dropping\r\nmeditatively to the hearthstone: “Dear, dear, the fire is out!”\r\n\r\nLangton was the centre of a group, wherever he happened to be, talking\r\ndelightfully, and twirling the oblong gold-mounted snuff-box, which\r\npromptly appeared as sociabilities began: a conspicuous figure, with\r\nhis height, his courteous smile, his mild beauty, and his habit of\r\ncrossing his arms over his breast, or locking his hands together on\r\nhis knee. He was a great rider, and could run like a hound. He had a\r\nqueerness of constitution which seemed to leave him at his lowest ebb\r\nevery afternoon about two of the clock, forgetful, weary, confused,\r\nand without an idea in his head; but after a little food, he was\r\nhimself again. At dinner-parties he usually rose fasting, “such was the\r\nperpetual flow of his conversation, and such the incessant claim made\r\nupon him.” A morning call from Mr. Langton was a thing to suggest the\r\neternal years; yet we are told that satiety dwelt not where he was;\r\nlike Cowley, “he never oppressed any man’s parts, or put any man out\r\nof countenance.” He had much the same sense of humor as Beauclerk had,\r\nand his speech was quite as full of good sense and direct observation,\r\nif not as cutting. He indicted a fault of Edmund Burke’s in one extreme\r\nstroke: “Burke whisks the end of his tail in the face of an arguer!”\r\nJohnson, the arch-whisker of tails, was not to be brought to book; but\r\nBurke’s greatness was of a texture to bear and enjoy the thrust. It is\r\ncurious that Langton was markedly fond of _Hudibras_; such a relish\r\nindicates, perhaps, the turn his own wit might have taken, had it not\r\nbeen held in by too much second thought.\r\n\r\nJohnson was wont to announce that he valued Langton for his piety,\r\nhis ancient descent, his amiable behavior, and his mastery of Greek.\r\n“Who in this town knows anything of Clenardus, sir, but you and I?”\r\nhe would say. In the midst of his talk Langton would fall into the\r\n“vowelled undertone” of the tongue he loved, correcting himself with a\r\nlittle wave of the hands, and the apologetic phrase: “And so it goes\r\non.” “Steeped to the lips in Greek” he was indeed, bursting out with\r\na joyous salute to the moon of Hellas, upon a friend’s doorstep, or\r\nmaking grotesque Hellene puns, for his own delight,[47] upon the blank\r\nleaves of a pocket-book. Every one familiar with Johnsoniana will\r\nrecall the charming and spirited retort written by Dr. Barnard, then\r\nDean of Derry, later, Bishop of Killaloe, which closes:\r\n\r\n    “If I have thoughts and can’t express ’em,\r\n     Gibbon shall teach me how to dress ’em\r\n            In terms select and terse;\r\n     Jones teach me modesty and Greek;\r\n     Smith, how to think; Burke, how to speak;\r\n            And Beauclerk, to converse!”\r\n\r\nIn all deference to the illustrious Sir William Jones, it may be\r\nclaimed that “modesty and Greek” were the very arts in which Langton\r\nwas a past-master. But he was an amateur, and a private scholar, and\r\nhis name was a dissyllable; else the Dean might have tossed at his feet\r\nas pretty a compliment as that given in the last line to his colleague.\r\nIt must have gratified Johnson that Langton refused, at Reynolds’s\r\ndinner-table, “like a sturdy scholar,” to sign the famous Round Robin\r\n(not signed, either, by Beauclerk) which besought him to “disgrace the\r\nwalls of Westminster with an English inscription.” And as if to keep\r\nLangton firmly of his own mind on the subject, it was to him the Doctor\r\nconfided the Greek quatrain, sad and proud, which he had dedicated to\r\nGoldsmith’s[48] memory.\r\n\r\nFor Bennet Langton Johnson had no criticism but praise. He presented\r\nhim with pride to Young and to Richardson, described him handsomely to\r\nHannah More, and proceeded to draw his character for Miss Reynolds, ere\r\nshe had met him, with such “energy and fond delight” as she avowed she\r\nnever could forget. What fine ringing metal was Johnson’s commendation!\r\n“He is one of those to whom Nature has not spread her volumes,\r\nnor uttered her voices, in vain.” “Earth does not bear a worthier\r\ngentleman.” “I know not who will go to Heaven if Langton does not.” And\r\nin the sweetest and completest approval ever put by one mortal upon\r\nanother: “_Sit anima mea cum Langtono!_” Yet even with this “angel of a\r\nman” the Doctor had one serious and ludicrous quarrel.\r\n\r\nIt was the fatal outcome of his uneven moods that he must needs be\r\ndisenchanted at times even with his best beadsmen: there came days\r\nwhen he would deny Beauclerk’s good-humor to be anything but “acid,”\r\nLangton’s anything but “muddy.” He considered it the sole grave\r\nfault of the latter that he was too ready to introduce a religious\r\ndiscussion into a mixed assembly, where he knew scarcely any two of\r\nthe company would be of the same mind. On Boswell’s suggestion that\r\nthis may have been done for the sake of instructing himself, Johnson\r\nreplied angrily that a man had no more right to take that means of\r\ngaining information than he had to pit two persons against each other\r\nin a duel for the sake of learning the art of self-defence. Some\r\nindiscretion of this sort on Langton’s part seems to have alienated\r\nthe friends for the first and last time. It was during their transient\r\nbitterness that the Doctor made the historic apology, across the table,\r\nto Oliver Goldsmith; an incident which, however beautiful in itself,\r\nwas a hard back-handed hit at Langton, standing by. Croker’s conjecture\r\nmay be true that the business which threatened to break a fealty of\r\nsome sixteen years’ standing arose rather from Langton’s settling his\r\nestate by will upon his sisters, whose tutor he had been. On hearing\r\nof it, the Great Cham grumbled and fumed, politely applying to the\r\nMisses Langton the title of “three dowdies!”[49] and shouting, in a\r\nfeudal warmth, that “an ancient estate, sir! an ancient estate should\r\nalways go to males.” In fact, the Doctor behaved very badly, very\r\nsardonically, and was pleased to lay hold of a post by Temple Bar one\r\nnight, and roar aloud over a piece of possible folly up in Lincolnshire\r\nwhich concerned him not in the least. But in due time the breach,\r\nwhatever its cause, was healed. The Doctor, in writing of it, uses\r\none of his balancing sentences: “Langton is a worthy fellow, without\r\nmalice, though not without resentment.” The two could not keep apart\r\nvery long, despite all the unreason in the world. “Johnson’s quarrels,”\r\nMr. Forster tells us, “were lovers’ quarrels.” Another memorable\r\npassage-at-arms, rich in comedy, happened in the course of one of\r\nJohnson’s sicknesses, when, in the cloistral silence of his chamber,\r\nhe solemnly implored Bennet Langton, always the companion who comforted\r\nhis sunless hours, to tell him wherein his life had been faulty. His\r\nshy and sagacious monitor wrote down, as accusation enough, various\r\nScriptural texts recommending tolerance, humility, long-suffering,\r\nand other meek ingredients which were not predominant in the sinner’s\r\nsocial composition. The penitent earnestly thanked Langton on taking\r\nthe paper from his hand, but presently turned his short-sighted eyes\r\nupon him from the pillow, and emerging from what his own verbology\r\nwould call a “frigorific torpor,” he exclaimed in a loud, wrathful,\r\nsuspicious tone: “What’s your drift, sir?” “And when I questioned him,”\r\nso Johnson afterwards told his blustering tale—“when I questioned him\r\nas to what occasion I had given him for such animadversion, all that\r\nhe could say amounted to this: that I sometimes contradicted people in\r\nconversation! Now, what harm does it do any man to be contradicted?” To\r\nthis same paternal young Langton the rebel submitted his Latin verses;\r\nthe _Poemata_, in the shape in which we possess them, were rigorously\r\nedited by him. And Johnson leaned upon him in more intimate ways, as he\r\ncould never lean upon Beauclerk. To the scrupulous nature instinctively\r\nright he made comfortable confidences: “Men of harder minds than ours\r\nwill do many things from which you and I would shrink; yet, sir, they\r\nwill, perhaps, do more good in life than we.”\r\n\r\nAs to the Honorable Topham Beauclerk, more volatile than Langton, he\r\nhad as steady a “sunshine of cheerfulness” for his heritage. We find\r\nhim complaining to a friend in the July of 1773: “Every hour adds to\r\nmy misanthropy; and I have had a pretty considerable share of it for\r\nsome years past.” This incursion of low spirits was not normal with\r\nhim. Johnson, bewailing his own morbid habits of mind, once said: “Some\r\nmen, and very thinking men, too, have not these vexing thoughts. Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds is the same all the year round; Beauclerk, when not ill\r\nand in pain, is the same.” Boswell attests that Beauclerk took more\r\nliberties with Johnson than durst any man alive, and that Johnson was\r\nmore disposed to envy Beauclerk’s talents than those of any one he had\r\never known. Born into the freedom of London, Beauclerk was familiar\r\nwith Fox, Selwyn, and Walpole, and with the St. James men who did not\r\nache to consort with Johnson; and he was quite their match in ease and\r\nastuteness. He walked the modish world, where Langton could not and\r\nwould not follow; he alternated the Ship Tavern and the gaming-table\r\nwith the court levees; Davies’s shop with the golden insipidities of\r\nthe drawing-room; _la comédie_, _la danse_, _l’amour même_, with the\r\nintellectual tie-wigs of Soho. It shows something of his spirit that\r\nwhereas no member of the Club save himself was a frequenter of White’s\r\nand Betty’s,[50] or a chosen guest at Strawberry Hill, yet there was no\r\nperson of fashion whom he was not proud to make known to Doctor Johnson\r\nwhenever he judged the candidate for so genuine an honor worthy of it.\r\nSome of these encounters must have been queer and memorable!\r\n\r\nBeauclerk’s unresting sarcasm often flattened out Boswell and irritated\r\nthe Doctor, though Bennet Langton, in his abandonments of enthusiastic\r\noptimism, was never more than grazed. It is not to be denied that this\r\nspoiled child of the Club liked to worry Goldsmith, the maladroit great\r\nman who might have quoted often on such occasions the sad gibe of\r\nHamlet:\r\n\r\n    “I’ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance\r\n     Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,\r\n     Stick fiery off indeed.”\r\n\r\nWhat a pity that Goldsmith’s _Retaliation_ was never finished, so as\r\nto include his portrait of Beau! He was “a pestilent wit,” as Anthony\r\nà Wood calls Marvell. Johnson, shy creature! deplored Beauclerk’s\r\n“predominance over his company.” The tyranny, however, was gracefully\r\nand decorously exercised, if we are to believe the unique eulogy that\r\n“no man was ever freer, when he was about to say a good thing, from a\r\nlook which expressed that it was coming; nor, when he had said it, from\r\na look which expressed that it had come.” Few human beings have had\r\na finer sense of fun than Topham Beauclerk. He had an infallible eye\r\nfor the values of blunders, and an incongruity came home to him like\r\na blessing from above. Life with him was a night-watch for diverting\r\nobjects and ideas. When he was not studying, he was disporting himself,\r\nlike the wits of the Restoration; and he was equal to all emergencies,\r\nas they succeeded one another. Every specimen preserved of his talk\r\nis perfect of its kind, and makes us long for a full index. Pointed\r\nhis speech was, always, and reminds one indeed of a foil, but without\r\nthe button; a dangerous little weapon, somewhat unfair, but carried\r\nwith such consummate flourish that those whom it pricks could almost\r\ncheer it. “O Lord! how I did hate that horrid Beauclerk!” Mrs. Piozzi\r\nscribbled once on the margin of Wraxall’s _Memoirs_, in an exquisite\r\nfeminine vindication of poor Beau’s accomplished tongue.\r\n\r\nHe was no disguiser of his own likes and dislikes. Politics he avoided\r\nas much as possible; but he affected less concern in public matters\r\nthan he really felt. “Consecrate that time to your friends,” he writes\r\nwith mock severity to the ideal Irishman, Lord Charlemont, “which\r\nyou spend in endeavoring to promote the interests of a half-million\r\nof scoundrels.” For his private business he had least zeal of all;\r\nand cites “my own confounded affairs” as the cause of his going into\r\nLancashire. Beauclerk had great tact, boldness, and independence; his\r\nnatural scorn of an oppressor was his modern and democratic quality.\r\nHis idleness (for he was as idle by habit as Langton was by nature) he\r\nrecognized, and lightly deprecated. Fastidious in everything, he made\r\n“one hour of conversation at Elmsley’s”[51] his standard of enjoyment,\r\nand his imagined extreme of annoyance was “to be clapped on the back\r\nby Tom Davies.” What he chose to call his leisure (again the ancestral\r\nStuart trait!) he dedicated to the natural sciences in his beloved\r\nlaboratory. “I see Mr. Beauclerk often, both in town and country,”\r\nwrote Goldsmith to Bennet Langton; “he is now going directly forward\r\nto become a second Boyle, deep in chemistry and physics.” When there\r\nwas some fanciful talk of setting up the Club as a college, “to draw\r\na wonderful concourse of students,” Beauclerk, by unanimous vote, was\r\nelected to the professorship of Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s influence on him, potent though it was, seems to have been\r\nnegative enough. It kept him from a few questionable things, and\r\npreserved in him an outward decorum towards customs and established\r\ninstitutions; but it failed to incite him to make of his manifold\r\ntalents the “illustrious figure” which Langton’s eyes discerned in a\r\nvain anticipation. Beauclerk and the great High Churchman went about\r\nmuch together, and had amusing experiences. On such occasions, as in\r\nall their familiar intercourse, the disciple had the true salt of the\r\nDoctor’s talk, which, as Hazlitt remarks, was often something quite\r\nunlike “the cumbrous cargo of words” he kept for professional use. In\r\nthe late winter of 1765 the two visited Cambridge, Beauclerk having a\r\nmind to call upon a friend at Trinity.\r\n\r\nThese, as we know, had their many differences, “like a Spanish great\r\ngalleon, and an English man-o’-war”; the one smooth, sharp, and civil,\r\nthe other indignantly dealing with the butt-end of personality. Boswell\r\ngives a long account of a charming dispute concerning the murderer\r\nof Miss Reay, and the evidence of his having carried two pistols.\r\nBeauclerk was right; but Johnson, with quite as solid a sense of\r\nvirtue, was angry; and he was soothed at the end only by an adroit\r\nand affectionate reply. “Sir,” the Doctor began, sternly, at another\r\ntime, after listening to some mischievous waggery, “you never open your\r\nmouth but with the intention to give pain, and you often give me pain,\r\nnot from the power of what you say, but from seeing your intention.”\r\nAnd again, he said to him whom he had compared to Alexander, marching\r\nin triumph into Babylon: “You have, sir! a love of folly, and a scorn\r\nof fools; everything you do attests the one, and everything you say\r\nthe other.”[52] Beauclerk could also lecture his mentor. It was his\r\nsteadfast counsel that the Doctor should devote himself to poetry, and\r\ndraw in his horns of dogma and didactics.\r\n\r\nHe had, ever ready, some quaint simile or odd application from the\r\nclassics; in the habit of “talking from books,” as the Doctor called\r\nit, he was, however, distanced by Langton. Referring to that friend’s\r\nhabit of sitting or standing against the fireplace, with one long leg\r\ntwisted about the other, “as if fearing to occupy too much space,”\r\nBeauclerk likened him, for all the world, to the stork in Raphael’s\r\ncartoon of The Miraculous Draught.[53] One of Beauclerk’s happiest\r\nhits, and certainly his boldest, was made while Johnson was being\r\ncongratulated upon his pension. “How much now it was to be hoped,”\r\nwhispered the young blood, in reference to Falstaff’s celebrated vow,\r\n“that he would purge and live cleanly, as a gentleman should do!”\r\nJohnson seems to have taken the hint in good-humor, and actually to\r\nhave profited by it.\r\n\r\nVery soon after leaving Oxford, Beauclerk became engaged to a Miss\r\nDraycott, whose family were well known to that affable blue-stocking,\r\nMrs. Montagu; but some coldness on his part, some sensitiveness on\r\nhers, broke off the match. His fortune-hunting parent is said to have\r\nbeen disappointed, as the lady owned several lead-mines in her own\r\nright. That same year, with Bennet Langton for companion part of the\r\nway, Beauclerk, whose health, never robust, now began to give him\r\nanxiety, set out on a Continental tour. Baretti, whom he had met at\r\nhome, received him most kindly at Milan, thanks to Johnson’s urgent\r\nand friendly letter. By his subsequent knowledge of Italian popular\r\ncustoms, he was able to testify in Baretti’s favor, when the latter\r\nwas under arrest for killing his man in the Haymarket, and in concert\r\nwith Burke, Garrick, Goldsmith, and Johnson, to help him, in a very\r\ninteresting case, towards his acquittal. It was reported to Selwyn\r\nthat the handsome gambling Inglese was robbed at Venice of £10,000!\r\nan incident which, perhaps, shortened his peregrinations. If the\r\nreport were accurate, it would prove that he could have been in no\r\nimmediate need of pecuniary rescue from his leaden sweetheart. It was\r\nDr. Johnson’s opinion, coinciding with the opinion of Roger Ascham on\r\nthe same general subject, that travel adds very little to one’s mental\r\nforces, and that Beauclerk might have learned more in the Academe of\r\n“Fleet Street, sir!”\r\n\r\nTopham Beauclerk married Lady Diana Spencer, the eldest daughter of\r\nthe second Duke of Marlborough, as soon as she obtained a divorce from\r\nher first husband. This was Frederick, Lord Bolingbroke, nephew and\r\nheir of the great owner of that title; a very trying gentleman, who\r\nwas the restless “Bully” of Selwyn’s correspondence; he survived until\r\n1787. The ceremony took place March 12, 1768, in St. George’s, Hanover\r\nSquare, “by license of the Archbishop of Canterbury,” both conspirators\r\nbeing then residents of the parish. Lady Diana Spencer was born in\r\nthe spring of 1734, and was therefore in her thirty-fifth year, while\r\nBeauclerk was but twenty-nine.[54] Johnson was disturbed, and felt\r\noffended at first with the whole affair; but he never withdrew from the\r\nagreeable society of Beauclerk’s wife. It is nothing wonderful that the\r\ncourtship and honey-moon was signalized by the forfeit of Beauclerk’s\r\nplace in the exacting Club, “for continued inattendance,” and not\r\nregained for a considerable period. “They are in town, at Topham’s\r\nhouse, and give dinners,” one of George Selwyn’s gossiping friends\r\nwrote, after the wedding. “Lord Ancram dined there yesterday, and\r\ncalled her nothing but Lady Bolingbroke the whole time!” Let us hope\r\nthat “Milady Bully” triumphed over her awkward guest, and looked, as\r\nEarl March once described her under other difficulties, “handsomer than\r\never I saw her, and not the least abashed;” or as deliberately easy as\r\nwhen she entertained with her gay talk the nervous Boswell who awaited\r\nthe news of his election or rejection from the Club. She was a blond\r\ngoddess, exceedingly fair to see. In her middle age she fell under the\r\nobservant glance of delightful Fanny Burney, who did not fail to allow\r\nher “pleasing remains of beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe _divorcée_ was fond of and faithful to her new lord, and no\r\ndrawback upon his æsthetic pride, inasmuch as she was an artist of no\r\nmean merit. Horace Walpole built a room for the reception of some of\r\nher drawings, which he called his Beauclerk Closet, “not to be shown\r\nto all the profane that come to see the house,” and he always praised\r\nthem extravagantly. It is surer critical testimony in her favor that\r\nher name figures yet in encyclopædias, and that Sir Joshua, the honest\r\nand unbought judge, much admired her work, which Bartolozzi was kept\r\nbusy engraving. It was her series of illustrations to Bürger’s wild\r\nballad of _Leonora_ (with the dolly knight, the wooden monks, the\r\ngenteel heroine, and the vigorous spectres) which, long after, helped\r\nto fire the young imagination of Shelley. It is to be feared that her\r\ninvaluable portrait of Samuel Johnson is not, or never was, extant.\r\n“Johnson was confined for some days in the Isle of Skye,” writes her\r\nrogue of a spouse, “and we hear that he was obliged to swim over to\r\nthe mainland, taking hold of a cow’s tail. . . . Lady Di has promised\r\nto make a drawing of it.” Sir Joshua’s pretty “Una” is the little\r\nElizabeth, afterwards Countess of Pembroke, elder daughter of Lady Di\r\nand Topham Beauclerk, painted the year her father died.\r\n\r\nThe family lived in princely style, both at their “summer quarters” at\r\nMuswell Hill, and on Great Russell Street, where the library, set in a\r\ngreat garden, reached, as Walpole mischievously gauged it, “half-way to\r\nHighgate.” Lady Di, an admirable hostess, proved herself one of those\r\nodd and rare women who take to their husbands’ old friends. Selwyn\r\nshe cordially liked, and her warmest welcome attended Langton, whom\r\nshe would rally for his remissness, when he failed to come to them at\r\nRichmond. He could reach them so easily! she said; all he need do was\r\nto lay himself at length, his feet in London and his head with them,\r\n_eodem die_. This Richmond home remained her residence during her\r\nwidowhood. Walpole mentions a Thames boat-race in 1791, when he sat in\r\na tent “just before Lady Di’s windows,” and gazed upon “a scene that\r\nonly Richmond, on earth, can exhibit.” In the church of the same leafy\r\ntown her body rests.\r\n\r\nBeauclerk died at his Great Russell Street house on March 11, 1780. He\r\nhad been failing steadily under visitations of his old trouble since\r\n1777, when he lay sick unto death at Bath, and when his wife nursed\r\nhim tenderly into what seemed to Walpole a miraculous recovery. He was\r\nbut forty-one years old, and, for all his genius, left no more trace\r\nbehind than that Persian prince who suddenly disappeared in the shape\r\nof a butterfly, and whom old Burton calls a “light phantastick fellow.”\r\nHis air of boyish promise, quite unconsciously worn, hoodwinked his\r\nfriends into prophecies of his fame. He did not give events a chance to\r\nput immortality on his “bright, unbowed, insubmissive head.” Yet he was\r\nbitterly mourned. “I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the\r\nearth to save him,” cried Johnson, who had loved him for over twenty\r\nyears; and again, to Lord Althorp: “This is a loss, sir, that perhaps\r\nthe whole nation could not repair.” Boswell mentions the Doctor’s April\r\nstroll, at this time, while he was writing his _Lives of the Poets_;\r\nand tells us how, returning from a call on the widow of the companion\r\nof his youth, David Garrick, he leaned over the rails of the Adelphi\r\nTerrace, watching the dark river, and thinking of “two such friends\r\nas cannot be supplied.” “Poor dear Beauclerk!” Johnson wrote, when his\r\nviolent grief had somewhat subsided, “_nec, ut soles, dabis joca!_ His\r\nwit and his folly, his acuteness and his maliciousness, his merriment\r\nand his reasoning, are alike over. Such another will not often be found\r\namong mankind.” Beyond this well-known and characteristic summing-up,\r\nthe Doctor made no discoverable mention, in his correspondence, of his\r\nbereavement, certainly not to the highly-prejudiced Mrs. Thrale, to\r\nwhom he wrote often and gayly in the year of Beauclerk’s death. Nor\r\nshall we know how the catastrophe affected Bennet Langton; for all the\r\nmost interesting papers relating to him were destroyed when the old\r\nHall at Langton-by-Spilsby was burned in 1855. On this subject, as on\r\nothers as intimate, he stands, perforce, silent.\r\n\r\nReaders may recall a passage in Miss Burney’s _Diary_ which gives\r\ncountenance to an accusation not borne out by any other testimony,\r\nthat Beauclerk and his wife had not lived happily together. Dining\r\nat Sir Joshua’s at Richmond, in 1782, Edmund Burke, sitting next the\r\nauthor of _Evelina_, took occasion, on catching sight of Lady Di’s\r\n“pretty white house” through the trees, to rejoice in the fact that\r\nshe was well-housed, moneyed, and a widow. He added that he had never\r\nenjoyed the good-fortune of another so keenly as in this blessed\r\ninstance. Then, turning to his new acquaintance, as the least likely\r\nto be informed of the matter, he spoke in his own “strong and marked\r\nexpressions” of the singular ill-treatment Beauclerk had shown his\r\nwife, and the “necessary relief” it must have been to her when he was\r\ncalled away. The statement does not seem to have been gainsaid by any\r\nof the company; nor was Burke liable to a slanderous error. So severe a\r\ncomment on Beauclerk, resting, even as it does, wholly on Miss Burney’s\r\nveracity, ought, in fairness, to be incorporated into any sketch of the\r\nman. On the other side, it is pleasant to discover that Beauclerk, in\r\nhis will, made five days before the end, bequeathed all he possessed to\r\nhis wife, and reverted to her the estates of his children, should they\r\ndie under age. There was but one bequest beyond these, and that was to\r\nThomas Clarke, the faithful valet. The executors named were Lady Di\r\nand her brother, Lord Charles Spencer, who had also been groomsman at\r\nthe marriage, which, despite Burke and its own evil beginnings, it is\r\nhard to think of as ill-starred. The joint guardians of Charles George\r\nBeauclerk, the only son, were to be Bennet Langton and a Mr. Loyrester,\r\nwhom Dr. Johnson speaks of as “Leicester, Beauclerk’s relation, and a\r\nman of good character;” but the guardianship, provisional in case of\r\nLady Di’s decease, never came into force, as she survived, in fullest\r\nharmony with her three children, up to August 1, 1808, having entered\r\nher seventy-fifth year. Various private legacies came to Langton, by\r\nhis old comrade’s dying wish, the most precious among them, perhaps,\r\nbeing the fine Reynolds portrait of Johnson, which had been painted at\r\nBeauclerk’s cost. Under it was inscribed:\r\n\r\n            “_Ingenium ingens\r\n    Inculto latet hoc sub corpore._”\r\n\r\nLangton thoughtfully effaced the lines. “It was kind of you to take\r\nit off,” said the burly Doctor, with a sigh; and then (for how could\r\nhe but recall the contrast of temperament in the two, as well as the\r\naffectionate context of Horace?), “not unkind in him to have put it\r\non.” The collection of thirty thousand glorious books “_pernobilis\r\nAngli T. Beauclerk_” was sold at auction. The advertisement alone is\r\nroyal reading. There is much amiable witness to the circumstance that\r\nBeauclerk was not only an admirer but a buyer of his friends’ works.\r\nFrom some kind busybody who attended the twenty-ninth day of the sale,\r\nand pencilled his observations upon the margins of the catalogue now in\r\nthe British Museum, we learn that Goldsmith’s _History of the Earth and\r\nAnimated Nature_ (nothing less!), which was issued, with cuts, in the\r\nyear he died, was knocked down to the vulgar for two and threepence.\r\nThe shelves, naturally, were stocked with Johnsons. Things dear to\r\nthe bibliophile were there: innumerable first editions, black-letter,\r\nmediæval manuscript, Elzevirs, priceless English and Italian classics,\r\ngathered with real feeling and pride; but the most vivid personal\r\ninterest belonged to the unpretending Lot 3444, otherwise known to fame\r\nas _The Rambler_, printed at Edinburgh in 1751; for that was the young\r\nBeauclerk’s own copy, carried with him to Oxford, and with a fragrance,\r\nas of a last century garden, of the first hearty friendship of boys.\r\nOne cannot help wishing that a sentimental fate left it in Langton’s\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nLady Beauclerk, Topham’s mother, had died in 1766; and he asked to be\r\nburied beside her, or at her feet, in the old chapel of Garston, near\r\nLiverpool: “an instance of tenderness,” said Johnson, “which I should\r\nhardly have expected.” There, in the place of his choice, he rests,\r\nwithout an epitaph.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Doctor consoled himself more than ever with Bennet\r\nLangton, and with the atmosphere of love and reverence which surrounded\r\nhim in Langton’s house. He had been of old the most desired of all\r\nguests at the family seat in Lincolnshire. “Langton, sir!” as he\r\nliked to announce, “had a grant of warren from Henry II.; and Cardinal\r\nStephen Langton, of King John’s reign, was of this family.” Peregrine\r\nLangton, Bennet’s uncle, was a man of simple and benevolent habits, who\r\nbrought economy to a science, without niggardliness, and whom Johnson\r\ndeclared to be one of those he clung to at once, both by instinct and\r\nreason; Bennet’s father, learned, good, and unaffected, the prototype\r\nof his learned, good, and unaffected son, was, however, a more\r\ndiverting character. He had sincerest esteem for Johnson, but looked\r\naskance on him for his liberal views, and suspected him, indeed, of\r\nbeing a Papist in secret! He once offered the Doctor a living of some\r\nvalue in the neighborhood, with the suggestion that he should qualify\r\nhimself for Orders: a chance gravely refused. Of this exemplary but\r\nrather archaic squire, Johnson, a dissector of everything he loved,\r\nsaid: “Sir! he is so exuberant a talker in public meetings that the\r\ngentlemen of his county are afraid of him. No business can be done\r\nfor his declamation.” In his behalf, too, Johnson produced one of his\r\nmost astounding words; for having understood that both Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLangton were averse to having their portraits taken, he observed aloud\r\nthat “a superstitious reluctance to sit for one’s picture is among the\r\nanfractuosities of the human mind.”\r\n\r\nBennet Langton married, on the 24th of May, 1770, Mary Lloyd, daughter\r\nof the Countess of Haddington, and widow of John, the eighth Earl of\r\nRothes, the stern soldier in laced waistcoat and breastplate beneath,\r\npainted by Sir Joshua. It was a common saying at the time that\r\neverybody was welcome to a Countess Dowager of Rothes; for it did so\r\nhappen that three ladies bearing that title were all remarried within\r\na few years. Lady Rothes, although a native of Suffolk, had acquired\r\nfrom long residence in Scotland the accent of that country, which Dr.\r\nJohnson bore with magnanimously, on the consideration that it was not\r\nindigenous. She had a handsome presence, full of easy dignity, and a\r\nnaturalness marked enough in the heyday of Georgian affectation. With\r\na vivacity very different from Lady Di Beauclerk’s, she kept herself\r\nthe spring and centre of Langton’s tranquil domestic circle: a more\r\nwomanly woman historiographers cannot find. His own charm of character,\r\nafter his marriage, slipped more and more into the underground channels\r\nof home-life, and so coursed on beneficently in silence. Their children\r\nwere no fewer than nine,[55] “not a plain face nor faulty person\r\namong them:” the goddess daughters six feet in height, and the three\r\nsons so like their Maypole father that they were able once to amuse\r\nthe Parisians by raising their arms to let a crowd pass. Langton was\r\nwont to repeat with some glee certain jests about his height, and Dr.\r\nJohnson’s nickname of “Lanky” he took ever with excellent grace; and\r\nwhen Garrick had leaped upon a chair to shake hands with him, in old\r\ndays, he had knelt, at parting, to shake hands with Garrick. But the\r\nKing’s awkward digs at his “long legs” he found terribly distasteful,\r\nnor was he thereby disposed to agree with the Doctor’s enthusiastic\r\nproclamation, after the famous interview of 1767, that George III. was\r\n“as fine a gentleman as Charles II.”\r\n\r\nIt was his cherished plan to educate his boys and girls at home, and\r\nto give them a thorough acquaintance with the learned languages. No\r\nsocial engagements were to stand in the way of this prime exigency. He\r\nwas in great haste to turn his young brood into Masters and Mistresses\r\nof Arts. Johnson complained to Miss Burney, as they were both taking\r\ntea at Mrs. Thrale’s, that nothing would serve Langton but to stand\r\nthem up before company, and get them to repeat a fable or the Hebrew\r\nalphabet, supplying every other word himself, and blushing with pride\r\nat the vicarious learning of his infants. But another of the tedious\r\nroyal jokes, “How does Education go on?” actually lessened his devotion\r\nto his self-set task, and worried him like the water-drop in the\r\nstory, which fell forever on a criminal’s head until it had drilled\r\nhis brain. Again, both he and his wife, even after they had moved into\r\nthe retirement of Great George Street, Westminster, in pursuance of\r\ntheir design, were far too agreeable and too accessible to be spared\r\nthe incursions of society. In a word, Minerva found her seat shaken,\r\nand her altar-fires not very well tended, and therefore withdrew.\r\nLangton impressed one axiom on his young scholars which they never\r\nforgot: “Next best to knowing is to be sensible that you do not know.”\r\nAn entirely superfluous waif of a baby was once left at the doors of\r\nthis same many-childrened house, to be fed, clothed, and petted by Mr.\r\nBennet Langton and Lady Rothes, without protest. Dr. Johnson, who made\r\nfriends with all children, was especially attached to their third girl,\r\nhis god-daughter, whom he called “pretty Mrs. Jane,” and “my own little\r\nJenny.” The very last year of his life her “most humble servant” sent\r\nher a loving letter, extant yet, and written purposely in a large round\r\nhand as clear as print.\r\n\r\n“Langton’s children are very pretty,” Johnson wrote to Boswell in\r\n1777, “and his lady loses her Scotch.” But again, during the same\r\nyear, condescendingly: “I dined lately with poor dear Langton. I do\r\nnot think he goes on well. His table is rather coarse, and he has his\r\nchildren too much about him.” Boswell takes occasion, in reproducing\r\nthis censure, to reprehend the custom of introducing the children after\r\ndinner: a parental indulgence to which he, at least, was not addicted.\r\nThe Doctor gave him a mild nudge on the subject in remarking later:\r\n“I left Langton in London. He has been down with the militia, and is\r\nagain quiet at home, talking to his little people, as I suppose you\r\ndo sometimes.” While Langton was in camp on Warley Common, in command\r\nof the Lincolnshire troops, Johnson spent with him five delightful\r\ndays, admiring his tall captain’s blossoming energies, and poking\r\nabout curiously among the tents. Langton had fallen, little by little,\r\ninto a confirmed extravagance, so that the moral of Uncle Peregrine’s\r\nsagacious living bade fair to be lost upon him. Boswell had a quarrel\r\nwith Johnson on the subject of Langton’s expenditure, during the course\r\nof which, according to his own report, the Laird of Auchinleck suffered\r\na “horrible shock” by being told that the best way to drive Langton out\r\nof his costly house would be to put him (Boswell) into it. The Doctor\r\nwas truly concerned, nevertheless, about his engaging spendthrift; up\r\nto the very end, he would implore him to keep account-books, even if\r\nhe had to omit his Aristophanes. “He complains of the ill effects of\r\nhabit,” grumbled the great moralizer, “and he rests content upon a\r\nconfessed indolence. He told his father himself that he had ‘no turn\r\nfor economy!’ but a thief might as well plead that he had no turn for\r\nhonesty.” Such were the hard hits sacred to those Dr. Johnson most\r\nesteemed. It transpires from his will that, by way of discouragement,\r\nhe had lent Langton £750.[56]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1785, Langton came from the country, and took lodgings\r\nin Fleet Street, in order to sit beside Johnson as he lay dying, and\r\nhold his hand. Nor was he alone in his pious offices: the Hooles, Mr.\r\nSestre, and several others were there, to keep constant vigil. Miss\r\nBurney met Langton in the passage December 11th, two days before the\r\nend: “He could not,” she wrote in her journal, “look at me, nor I at\r\nhim.” But through the foggy and restless nights when Johnson tried\r\nto cheer himself, like More and Master William Lilly, by translating\r\ninto Latin some epigrams from the _Anthologia_, the true Grecian\r\nbeside him must have been his chief comfort. One can picture the old\r\neyes turning to him for sympathy, perhaps with that same murmured\r\n“Lanky!” on awaking, which Boswell laughed to hear from him one merry\r\nHebridean morning, twelve years before. The last summons did not come\r\nin Langton’s presence. Hurrying over to Bolt Court at eight of the\r\nfatal evening, he was told that all was over three-quarters of an hour\r\nago. That large soul had gone away, as Leigh Hunt so beautifully said\r\nof Coleridge, “to an infinitude hardly wider than his thoughts.” Then\r\nLangton, who was wont to shape his words with grace and ease, went\r\nup-stairs, and tried to pen a letter to Boswell, which is more touching\r\nthan tears: “I am now sitting in the room where his venerable remains\r\nexhibit a spectacle, the interesting solemnity of which, difficult as\r\nit would be in any sort to find terms to express, so to you, my dear\r\nsir, whose sensations will paint it so strongly, it would be of all men\r\nthe most superfluous to”—and there, hopelessly choked and confused, it\r\nbroke off.\r\n\r\nLangton bore Johnson’s pall; and he succeeded him as Professor of\r\nAncient Literature in the Royal Academy, as Gibbon had replaced\r\nGoldsmith in the chair of Ancient History. He survived many years,\r\nthe delight of his company to the last. He, like others, was given\r\nin his later years to detailing anecdotes of his great friend, with\r\nan approximation to that friend’s manner. One lady critic, at least,\r\nthought that these explosive imitations did not become “his own serious\r\nand respectable character.” On December 18, 1801, in Anspach Place,\r\nSouthampton, a venerable nook “between the walls and the sea,” when\r\nWordsworth, Scott, and Coleridge were yet in their unheralded prime,\r\nwhen Charles Lamb was twenty-six, Byron a dreaming boy on the Cotswold\r\nhills, and Keats and Shelley little fair-eyed children, gentle Bennet\r\nLangton, known to none of these, and somewhat forgotten as a loiterer\r\nfrom the march of a glorious yesterday, slipped out of life. “I am\r\npersuaded,” wrote one who knew him well, “that all his inactivity, all\r\nthe repugnance he showed to putting on the harness of this world’s\r\ntoil, arose from the spirituality of his frame of mind . . . I believe\r\nhis mind was in Heaven, wheresoever he corporeally existed.” He was\r\nlaid under the chancel of ancient St. Michael’s at Southampton, with\r\nJohnson’s fond benison, “Be my soul with Langton’s!” inscribed on the\r\nmarble tablet above him.[57] The Rev. John Wooll of Midhurst, Joseph\r\nWarton’s editor, was one of the few present at the funeral ceremony,\r\nand he leaves us to infer that it had a rather neglectful privacy,\r\nnot, indeed, out of keeping with the “godly, righteous, and sober\r\nlife” it closed. Langton’s will, drawn up in the June of 1800, and\r\npreserved in Somerset House, devised to the sole executrix, his “dear\r\nwife,” who outlived him by nearly twenty years, his real and personal\r\nestate, his books, his wines, his prints, his horses, and, as a gift\r\nparticularly pretty, his right of navigation in the river Wey. George\r\nLangton was separately provided for, but there were some £8000 for the\r\neight younger children. The document is crowded with technical details,\r\nand very long; and the manifest inference, on the whole, is that the\r\ndear squire’s affairs were in a prodigious tangle. There is no wish\r\nexpressed concerning his burial, and, what is more curious, there\r\nare no Christian formulas for the committal of the _animula vagula\r\nblandula_: a lack perhaps not to be wondered at in Beauclerk’s concise\r\ntestament, but somewhat notable in the case of a person who certainly\r\nhad a soul.\r\n\r\nSo went Beauclerk first of the three, Langton last, with the good ghost\r\nstill between them, as he in his homespun, they in their flowered\r\nvelvet, had walked many a year together on this earth. The old\r\ncompanionship had undergone some sorry changes ere it fell utterly to\r\ndust and ashes. Its happy prime had been in the Oxford “Longs,” when\r\nthe Doctor humored his lads, and tented under their roofs, plucking\r\nflowers at one house, and romping with dogs at the other; or in 1764,\r\nat the starting of the immortal Club, when the two of its founders, who\r\nhad no valid or pretended claim to celebrity, perched on the sills like\r\nuseful genii, with a mission to overrule sluggish melancholy, and renew\r\nthe sparkle in abstracted eyes. How supereminently they did what they\r\nchose to do, and what vagaries they roused out of Johnson’s profound\r\nhypochondria! Did not Topham Beauclerk’s mother once have to reprove\r\nthat august author for a suggestion to seize some pleasure-grounds\r\nwhich they were passing in a carriage? “Putting such things into young\r\npeople’s heads!” said she. Where could the innocent Beauclerk’s elbow\r\nhave been at that moment, contrary to the canons of polite society,\r\nbut in the innocent Langton’s ribs? The gray reprobate, so censured,\r\nexplained to Boswell: “Lady Beauclerk has no notion of a joke, sir! She\r\ncame late into life, and has a mighty unpliable understanding.” Who\r\ncan forget the Doctor’s visit to Beauclerk at Windsor, when, falling\r\ninto the clutches of that gamesome and ungodly youth, he was beguiled\r\nfrom church-going of a fine Sunday morning, and strolled about outside,\r\ntalking and laughing during sermon-time, and finally spread himself at\r\nlength on a mossy tomb, only to be told, with a giggle and a pleased\r\nrub of the hands, that he was as bad as Hogarth’s Idle Apprentice?\r\nOr the other visit in the north, when, after ceremoniously relieving\r\nhis pockets of keys, knife, pencil, and purse, Samuel Johnson, LL.D.,\r\ndeliberately rolled down a hill, and landed, betumbled out of all\r\nrecognition, at the bottom? Langton had tried to dissuade him, for the\r\nincline was very steep, and the candidate scarcely of the requisite\r\nsuppleness. “Oh, but I haven’t had a roll for such a long time!”\r\npleaded his unanswerable big guest.\r\n\r\nBest of all, we have the history of that memorable morning when\r\nBeauclerk and Langton, having supped together at a city tavern, roused\r\nJohnson at three o’clock at his Inner Temple Lane Chambers, and brought\r\nhim to the door, fearful but aggressive, in his shirt and his little\r\ndark wig, and his slippers down at the heels, armed with a poker.\r\n“What! and is it YOU? Faith, I’ll have a frisk with you, ye young\r\ndogs!” We have visions of the Covent Garden inn, and the great brimming\r\nbowl, with Lord Lansdowne’s drinking-song for grace; the hucksters and\r\nfruiterers staring at the strange central figure, always sure to gather\r\na mob, even during the moment he would stand by a lady’s coach-door\r\nin Fleet Street; the merry boat going its way by oar to Billingsgate,\r\nits mad crew bantering the watermen on the river; and two of the\r\nroisterers (equally wild, despite a little chronological disparity\r\nof thirty years or so) scolding the other for hastening off, on an\r\nafternoon appointment, “to dine with wretched unidea’d girls!” What\r\ngolden vagabondism! “I heard of your frolic t’other night; you’ll be in\r\n_The Chronicle_! . . . I shall have my old friend to bail out of the\r\nround-house!” said Garrick. “As for Garrick, sirs,” tittered the pious\r\nJohnson aside to his accomplices, “he dare not do such a thing. His\r\nwife would not let him!” All this mirth and whim sweetened the Doctor’s\r\nheavy life. He had other intimates, other disciples. But these were Gay\r\nHeart and Gentle Heart, who drove his own blue-devils away with their\r\nidolatrous devotion, and whose bearing towards him stands ever as the\r\nbest possible corroboration of his great and warm nature. With him\r\nand for him, they so fill the air of the time that to whomsoever has\r\nbut thought of them that hour, London must seem lonely without their\r\nidyllic figures.\r\n\r\n                          —“Our day is gone:\r\n    Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done.”\r\n\r\nThere are gods as good for the after-years; but Odin is down, and his\r\npair of unreturning birds have flown west and east.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] A popular eighteenth-century beverage, composed of wine, orange,\r\nand sugar.\r\n\r\n[46] Although Langton is recorded on his college books as having given\r\nthe usual £10 for plate, and also as having paid his caution money\r\nin 1757, his name is not down upon the matriculation lists, possibly\r\nbecause he failed to appear at the moment the entries were being made.\r\nIn what must have been his destined space upon one of the pages, Dr.\r\nIngram made this note: “Q. Num Bennet Langton hic inserendus?”\r\n\r\n[47] A boyish fashion of self-entertainment afterwards in great favor\r\nwith Shelley.\r\n\r\n[48] It is a pleasant thing to remember that it was Langton, always an\r\nappreciator of Goldsmith’s lovable genius, who suggested “Auburn” as\r\nthe name for his _Deserted Village_. There is a hamlet called Auborne\r\nin Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n[49] Langton’s sisters are generally spoken of as three in number. But\r\nBurke’s _History of the Landed Gentry_ mentions but two, Diana and\r\nJuliet. There was a younger brother, Ferne, who died in boyhood, and\r\nthe floral name, not unlike a girl’s, may have been responsible for the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n[50] The fruiterer.\r\n\r\n[51] The bookseller’s.\r\n\r\n[52] Rochester, in his immortal epigram, had said the same of King\r\nCharles II.\r\n\r\n[53] This neat descriptive stroke has been attributed also to Richard\r\nPaget.\r\n\r\n[54] The register of St. George’s betrays a little eager blunder of\r\nLady Di’s which is amusing. When the officiating curate asked her to\r\nsign, she wrote “Diana Beauclerk,” and was obliged to cross out the\r\nsignature—one knows with what a smile and a flush!—and substitute the\r\n“Diana Spencer” which stands beside it.\r\n\r\n[55] Miss Hawkins says “ten,” and may have had the extra adopted child\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n[56] It is a pity he did not live to read the jolly _American Ballad\r\nof Bon Gaultier_, which seems to have a sort of muddled clairvoyant\r\nknowledge of this transaction:\r\n\r\n“Every day the huge Cawana Lifted up its monstrous jaws; And it\r\nswallowed Langton Bennet,(!) And digested Rufus Dawes.\r\n\r\n“Riled, I ween, was Philip Slingsby Their untimely deaths to hear; For\r\none author owed him money,(!) And the other loved him dear.”\r\n\r\n[57] The church has since been “restored,” and the fine epitaph is now\r\n(1890) “skyed” on the south wall of the nave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HAZLITT\r\n\r\n1778-1830\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE titles of William Hazlitt’s first books bear witness to the ethic\r\nspirit in which he began life. From his beloved father, an Irish\r\ndissenting minister, he inherited his unworldliness, his obstinacy, his\r\nlove of inexpedient truth, and his interest in the emancipation and\r\nwell-being of his fellow-creatures. Bred in an air of seriousness and\r\nintegrity, the child of twelve announced by post that he had spent “a\r\nvery agreeable day” reading one hundred and sixty pages of Priestley,\r\nand hearing two good sermons. A year later he appeared, under a Greek\r\nsignature, in _The Shrewsbury Chronicle_, protesting against sectarian\r\ninjustice; an infant herald in the great modern movement towards fair\r\nplay. The roll of the portentous periods must have made his father\r\nweep for pride and diversion. William’s young head was full of moral\r\nphilosophy and jurisprudence, and he had what is the top of luxury\r\nfor one of his temperament: perfect license of mental growth. Alone\r\nwith his parents (one of whom was always a student and a recluse),\r\nand for the most part without the school-fellows who are likely to\r\nadjust the perilous effects of books, he became choked with theories,\r\nand thought more of the needful repeal of the Test Act than of his\r\nbreakfast. He found his way at fourteen into the Unitarian College at\r\nHackney, but eventually broke from his traces, saving his fatherland\r\nfrom the spectacle of a unique theologian. During the year 1795 he\r\nsaw the pictures at Burleigh House, and began to live. Desultory but\r\ndeep study, at home and near home, took up the time before his first\r\nleisurely choice of a profession. His lonely broodings, his early\r\nlove for Miss Railton, his four enthusiastic months at the Louvre,\r\nhis silent friendship with Wordsworth and with Coleridge; the country\r\nwalks, the pages and prints, the glad tears of his youth,—these were\r\nthe fantastic tutors which formed him; nor had he ever much respect for\r\nany other kind of training. The lesson he prized most was the lesson\r\nstraight from life and nature. He comments, tartly enough, on the\r\nsophism that observation in idleness, or the growth of bodily skill and\r\nsocial address, or the search for the secret of honorable power over\r\npeople, is not in any wise to be accounted as learning. Montaigne, who\r\nwas in Hazlitt’s ancestral line, was of this mind: “_Ce qu’on sçait\r\ndroictement, on en dispose sans regarder au patron, sans tourner les\r\nyeulx vers son livre._” Hazlitt insists, too, that learned men are\r\nbut “the cisterns, not the fountain-heads, of knowledge.” He hated\r\nthe schoolmaster, and has said as witty things of him as Mr. Oscar\r\nWilde. Yet his little portrait-study of the mere book-worm, in _The\r\nConversation of Authors_, has a never-to-be-forgotten sweetness. His\r\nmental nurture was serviceable; it was of his own choosing; it fitted\r\nhim for the work he had to do. Like Marcus Aurelius, he congratulated\r\nhimself that he did not squander his youth “chopping logic and scouring\r\nthe heavens.” Hazlitt once entered upon an _Inquiry whether the Fine\r\nArts are promoted by Academies_; the answer, from him, is readily\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n    “If arts and schools reply,”\r\n\r\nhe might have added,—and it is a wonder that he did not,\r\n\r\n    “Give arts and schools the lie!”\r\n\r\nMr. Matthew Arnold made a famous essay on the same topic, and some\r\nreaders recollect distinctly that his verdict, for England, would be\r\nin the affirmative, whereas it was no such matter. Now, no man can\r\nconceive of Hazlitt presenting both sides of a case so impartially as\r\nto be misunderstood, especially upon so vital a subject. He pastured,\r\nhe was not trained; and therefore he would have you and your children’s\r\nchildren scoff at universities. Indeed, though the boy’s lack of\r\ndiscipline told on him all through life, his reader regrets nothing\r\nelse which a university could have given him, except, perhaps, milder\r\nmanners. Hazlitt was perfectly aware that he had too little general\r\nknowledge; but general knowledge he did not consider so good a tool for\r\nhis self-set task in life as a persistent, passionate study of one or\r\ntwo subjects. Again, he is pleased to conjecture, with bluntness, that\r\nif he had learned more he would have thought less. (Perhaps he was the\r\nfriend cited by Elia, who gave up reading to improve his originality!\r\nHe was certainly useful to Elia in delicate and curious ways: a whole\r\nvein of rich eccentricity ready for that sweet philosopher’s working.)\r\nHear him pronouncing upon himself at the very end: “I have, then, given\r\nproof of some talent and more honesty; if there is haste and want of\r\nmethod, there is no common-place, nor a line that licks the dust. If\r\nI do not appear to more advantage, I at least appear such as I am.”\r\nDivorce that remark and the truth of it from Hazlitt, and there is\r\nno Hazlitt left. He stood for individualism. He wrote from what was,\r\nin the highest degree for his purpose, a full mind, and with that\r\nblameless conscious superiority which a full mind must needs feel in\r\nthis empty world. His whole intellectual stand is taken on the positive\r\nand concrete side of things. He has a fine barbaric cocksureness; he\r\ndwells not with althoughs and neverthelesses, like Mr. Symonds and Mr.\r\nSaintsbury. “I am not one of those,” he says, concerning Edmund Kean’s\r\nfirst appearance in London, “who, when they see the sun breaking from\r\nbehind a cloud, stop to inquire whether it is the moon.” And he takes\r\nenormous interest in his own promulgation, because it is inevitably\r\nnot only what he thinks, but what he has long thought. He delivers an\r\nopinion with the air proper to a host who is master of a vineyard, and\r\ncan furnish name and date to every flagon he unseals.\r\n\r\nNone of Hazlitt’s energies went to waste: he earned his soul early, and\r\nhow proud he was of the possession! Retrospection became his forward\r\nhorizon. He was all aglow at the thought of that beatific yesterday;\r\nin his every mood “the years that are fled knock at the door, and\r\nenter.” He struggled no more thereafter, having fixed his beliefs and\r\nfound his voice. He saw no occasion to change. “As to myself,” he wrote\r\nat fifty, referring to Lamb’s well-known “surfeits of admiration”\r\nconcerning some objects once adored, “as to myself, any one knows\r\nwhere to have me!” He adds: “In matters of taste and feeling, one\r\nproof that my conclusions have not been quite shallow or hasty is the\r\ncircumstance of their having been lasting. . . . This continuity of\r\nimpression is the only thing on which I pride myself.” A fine saying in\r\nthe _Boswell Redivivus_, attributed to Opie, is as clearly expressed\r\nelsewhere by Hazlitt’s self: that a man in his lifetime can do but\r\none thing; that there is but one effort and one victory, and all the\r\nrest is as machinery in motion. “What I write costs me nothing, but it\r\ncost me a great deal twenty years ago. I have added little to my stock\r\nsince then, and taken little from it.” His sensations, latterly, were\r\n“July shoots,” graftings on the old sap. It is his boast in almost his\r\nfinal essay that his tenacious brain holds fast while the planets are\r\nturning. He can look at a child’s kite in heaven, to the last, with the\r\neyes of a child: “It pulls at my heart.”\r\n\r\nHis conservative habit, however, seemed to teach him everything by\r\ninference. In 1821, familiar with none of the elder dramatists save\r\nShakespeare, he borrowed their folios, and shut himself up for six\r\nweeks at Winterslow Hut on Salisbury Plain. He returned to town steeped\r\nin his theme, and with the beautiful and authoritative _Lectures_\r\nwritten. Appreciation of the great Elizabethans is common enough now;\r\nseventy years ago, propagated by Lamb’s _Specimens_, 1808, it was the\r\nbusiness only of adventurers and pioneers. Here is a critic indeed who,\r\nwithout a suspicion of audacity, can arise as a stranger to arraign\r\nthe _Arcadia_, and “shake hands with Signor Orlando Friscobaldo as the\r\noldest acquaintance” he has! The thing, exceptional as it was, proves\r\nthat William Hazlitt knew his resources. His devoted friend Patmore\r\nattributes his “unpremeditated art,” terse, profound, original, and\r\nalways moving at full speed, to two facts: “first, that he never, by\r\nchoice, wrote on any topic or question in which he did not, for some\r\nreason or other, feel a deep personal interest; and, secondly, because\r\non all questions on which he did so feel, he had thought, meditated,\r\nand pondered, in the silence and solitude of his own heart, for years\r\nand years before he ever contemplated doing more than thinking of\r\nthem.” Unlike a distinguished historian, who, according to Horace\r\nWalpole, “never understood anything until he had written of it,”\r\nHazlitt brought to his every task a mind violently made up, and a\r\nvocation for special pleading which nothing could withstand.\r\n\r\nSure as he is, he means to be nobody’s hired guide: a resolve for\r\nwhich the general reader cannot be too grateful. In wilful and mellow\r\nstudy of what chance threw in his way his strength grew, and his\r\nlimitations with it. It is small wonder that he hated schoolmasters,\r\nand the public which expected of him schoolmaster platitudes. He had\r\na pride of intellect not unlike Rousseau’s, and he seems to have had\r\never in mind Rousseau’s cardinal declaration that if he were no better\r\nthan other men, he was at least different from them. Hazlitt defined\r\nhis own functions with proper haughtiness, in the amusing apology of\r\n_Capacity and Genius_. “I was once applied to, in a delicate emergency,\r\nto write an article on a difficult subject for an encyclopædia; and was\r\nadvised to take time, and give it a systematic and scientific form;\r\nto avail myself of all the knowledge that was to be obtained upon the\r\nsubject, and arrange it with clearness and method. I made answer that,\r\nas to the first, I _had_ taken time to do all that I ever pretended\r\nto do, as I had thought incessantly on different matters for twenty\r\nyears of my life; that I had no particular knowledge of the subject\r\nin question, and no head for arrangement; that the utmost I could do,\r\nin such a case, would be, when a systematic and scientific article\r\nwas prepared, to write marginal notes upon it, to insert a remark or\r\nillustration of my own (not to be found in former encyclopædias!) or to\r\nsuggest a better definition than had been offered in the text.”[58]\r\nSuch independence nobly became him, and none the less because it kept\r\nhim poor. But in the course of time, he had to work, and keep on\r\nworking, under wretched disadvantages. He had spurts of revolt, after\r\nlong experience of compulsory composition; his darling wish in 1822\r\n(confided to his wife, of all persons) being that he “could marry some\r\nwoman with a good fortune, that he might not be under the necessity of\r\nwriting another line!”\r\n\r\nThere was in him absolutely nothing of the antiquary and the\r\nscholar, as the modern world understands those most serviceable\r\ngentlemen. He was a “surveyor,” as he said, erroneously, of Bacon.\r\nHe was continuously drawn into the byway, and ever in search of the\r\naccidental, the occult; he lusted, like Sir Thomas Browne, to find the\r\ngreat meanings of minor things. The “pompous big-wigs” of his day, as\r\nThackeray called them, hated his informality, his boldly novel methods,\r\nhis vivacity and enthusiasm. He had, within proscribed bounds, an\r\nexquisite and affectionate curiosity, like that of the Renaissance.\r\n“The invention of a fable is to me the most enviable exertion of human\r\ngenius: it is the discovery of a truth to which there is no clew, and\r\nwhich, when once found out, can never be forgotten.” “If the world were\r\ngood for nothing else, it would be a fine subject for speculation.” It\r\nis his deliberate dictum that it were “worth a life” to sit down by an\r\nItalian wayside, and work out the reason why the Italian supremacy in\r\nart has always been along the line of color, not along the line of form.\r\n\r\nHe depended so entirely upon his memory that those who knew him best\r\nsay that he never took notes, neither in gallery, library, nor theatre;\r\nyet his inaccuracies are few and slight,[59] and he must have secured\r\nby this habit a prodigious freedom and luxury in the act of writing.\r\nHe would rather stumble than walk according to rule; and he was so\r\npleasantly beguiled with some of his own images (that, for instance,\r\nof immortality the bride of the youthful spirit, and of the procession\r\nof camels seen across the distance of three thousand years) that he\r\nreiterates them upon every fit occasion. He cites, twice and thrice,\r\nthe same passages from the Elizabethans. He is a masterly quoter, and\r\nlingers like a suitor upon the borders of old poesy. His infallibility,\r\nlike the Pope’s, is of narrow scope and nicely defined. When he steps\r\nbeyond his accustomed tracks, which is seldom, his vagaries are\r\nentertaining. You may account for his declaration that Thomas Warton’s\r\nsonnets rank as the very best in the language, by reflecting that he\r\ndealt not in sonnets and knew nothing of them; if he prefer _Hercules\r\nRaging_ to any other Greek tragedy, it is collateral proof that he was\r\nno wide-travelled Grecian, nor even Euripideian; when he gives his\r\ndistinguished preference to Shakespeare’s Helena, there is small need\r\nof adding that Mr. Hazlitt, albeit with an affectionate friendship for\r\nMary Lamb, with a mother, a sister, a dynasty of sweethearts, and two\r\nwives, was notoriously unlearned in women.[60]\r\n\r\nThe events of his life count for so little that they are hardly worth\r\nrecording. He was born into a high-principled and intelligent family,\r\nat Mitre Lane, Maidstone, Kent, on the 10th of April, in the year 1778.\r\nHis infancy was passed there and in Ireland, his boyhood in New England\r\nand in Shropshire. Prior to a long visit to Paris, where he made some\r\nnoble copies of Titian, he came in 1802 to Bloomsbury, where his\r\nelder brother John, an advanced Liberal in politics and an excellent\r\nminiature-painter, had a studio; and here he worked at art for several\r\njoyous years, finally abandoning it for literature. The portraits he\r\npainted, utterly lacking in grace, are fraught with power and meaning;\r\nfew of these are extant, thanks to the fading and cracking pigments\r\nof the modern schools. The old Manchester woman in shadow, done in\r\n1803, and the head of his father, dating from a twelvemonth later (two\r\nthings to which Hazlitt makes memorable reference in his essays),\r\nare no longer distinguishable, save to a very patient eye, upon the\r\nblackened canvases in his grandson’s possession. The picture of the\r\nchild Hartley Coleridge, begun at the Lakes in 1802, has perished\r\nfrom the damp; that of Charles Lamb in the Venetian doublet survives\r\nsince 1804, in its serious and primitive browns,[61] as the best-known\r\nexample of an English artist not in the catalogues. Its historic value,\r\nhowever, is not superior to that of two portraits of Hazlitt himself:\r\none a study in strong light and shade, with a wreath upon the head,\r\nnow very much time-eaten; and another representing him at about the\r\nage of twenty-five, with a three-quarters front face looking over the\r\nright shoulder, which appeals to the spectator like spoken truth. It\r\nis all but void of the beauty characterizing the striking Bewick head\r\n(especially as retouched and reproduced in Mr. Alexander Ireland’s\r\nvaluable book of 1889, which is a sort of Hazlitt anthology), and\r\ncharacterizing, no less, John Hazlitt’s charming miniatures of William\r\nat five and at thirteen; therefore it can deal in no self-flattery.\r\nFortunately, we have from the hand which knew him best the lank, odd,\r\nreserved youth in whom great possibilities were brewing; thought and\r\nwill predominate in this portrait, and it expresses the sincere soul.\r\nIt would be idle to criticise the technique of a work disowned by its\r\nauthor. Hazlitt had, as we know from much testimony, a most interesting\r\nand perplexing face, with the magnificent brow almost belied by\r\nshifting eyes, and the petulance and distrust of the mouth and chin;\r\nbut a face prepossessing on the whole from the clear marble of his\r\ncomplexion,[62] remarkable in a land of ruddy cheeks. His lonely and\r\npeculiar life lent him its own hue; the eager look of one indeed a\r\nsufferer, but with the light full upon him of visions and of dreams:\r\n\r\n    “_Chi pallido si fece sotto l’ombra\r\n    Sì di Parnaso, o bevve in sua cisterna?_”\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Hazlitt had his immortal meeting at Wem with Samuel Taylor\r\nColeridge. He described himself at this period as “dumb, inarticulate,\r\nhelpless, like a worm by the wayside,” striving in vain to put on paper\r\nthe thoughts which oppressed him, shedding tears of vexation at his\r\ninability, and feeling happy if in eight years he could write as many\r\npages. The abiding influence of his First Poet he has acknowledged\r\nin an imperishable chapter. For a long while he still kept in “the\r\no’erdarkened ways” of Malthus and Tucker, or in the shadow, dear to\r\nhim, of Hobbes; but in 1817 the floodgates broke, the pure current\r\ngushed out; and in the _Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays_ we have the\r\nprimal pledge of Hazlitt as we know him, “such as had never been before\r\nhim, such as will never be again.” From a “dumbness” and diffidence\r\nextreme, he developed into the readiest of writers; his sudden pages,\r\nyear after year, transcribed in his slant large hand, went to the\r\nprinters rapidly and at first draft. The longer he used his dedicated\r\npen, the freer, the brighter, the serener it grew. In the fourteen or\r\nfifteen of his books which deal with genius and the conduct of life,\r\nthere is, throughout, an indescribable unaffected zest, a self-same\r\nand unwavering certitude of handling. Once he learned his trade, he\r\ngave himself a large field and an easy rein. He never warmed towards\r\na subject chosen for him. His conversation was non-professional. He\r\nconsidered a discussion as to the likelihood of the weather’s holding\r\nup for to-morrow as “the end and privilege of a life of study.”\r\n\r\nIn London, as soon as he had abandoned painting, he became a\r\nparliamentary reporter, and began to lecture on the English\r\nphilosophers and metaphysicians. He furnished his famous dramatic\r\ncriticisms to _The Morning Chronicle_, _The Champion_, _The Examiner_,\r\nand _The Times_, and he acted later as home editor of _The Liberal_.\r\nHe married, on May-day of 1808, Miss Sarah Stoddart, who owned the\r\nproperty near Salisbury where he afterwards spent melancholy years\r\nalone. He fulfilled one human duty perfectly, for he loved and reared\r\nhis son. A most singular infatuation for the unlovely daughter of his\r\nlandlady; a second inauspicious marriage in 1824 with a Mrs. Isabella\r\nBridgwater; a prolonged journey on the Continent; the failure of\r\nthe publishers of his _Life of Napoleon_, which thus in his needful\r\ndays brought him no competence; a long illness heroically borne, and\r\na burial in the parish churchyard of St. Anne’s, under a headstone\r\nraised, in a romantic remorse after an estrangement, by Charles Wells,\r\nthe author of _Joseph and his Brethren_,—these round out the meagre\r\ndetails of Hazlitt’s life. He died in the arms of his son and of his\r\nold friend Charles Lamb,[63] on the 18th of September, 1830, at 6 Frith\r\nStreet, Soho.\r\n\r\nHis domestic experiences, indeed, had been nearly as extraordinary as\r\nShelley’s. Sarah Walker, of No. 9 Southampton Buildings, is a sort of\r\nburlesque counterpart of that other “spouse, sister, angel,” Emilia\r\nViviani. Nothing in literary history is much funnier than Mr. Hazlitt’s\r\nkind assistance to Mrs. Hazlitt in securing her divorce, going to visit\r\nher at Edinburgh, and supplying funds and advice over the teacups,\r\nwhile the process was pending, unless it be Shelley’s ingenuous\r\ninvitation to his deserted young wife to come and dwell forever with\r\nhimself and Mary! The silent dramatic withdrawal of the second Mrs.\r\nHazlitt, the well-to-do relict of a colonel, who is henceforth\r\nswallowed up in complete oblivion, is a feature whose like is missing\r\nin Shelley’s romance. Events in Hazlitt’s path were not many, and his\r\ninner calamities seem somehow subordinated to exterior workings. It is\r\nnot too much to say that to the French Revolution and the white heat of\r\nhope it diffused over Europe he owed the renewal of the very impetus\r\nwithin him: his moral probity, his mental vigor, and his physical\r\ncheer. His measure of men and things was fixed by its standard. Other\r\nenthusiasts wavered and went back to the flesh-pots of Egypt, but not\r\nhe. _Et cuncta terrarum subacta præter atrocem animum Catonis._ Towards\r\nthe grandest inconsistency this world has seen, he bore himself with a\r\nconsistency nothing less than touching. Everywhere, always, as a friend\r\nwho understood him well reminds a later generation, “Hazlitt was the\r\nonly man of letters in England who dared openly to stand by the French\r\nRevolution, through good and evil report, and who had the magnanimity\r\nnever to turn his back upon its child and champion.” The ruin of\r\nNapoleon, and the final news that “the hunter of greatness and of glory\r\nwas himself a shade,” meant more to him than the relinquishment of\r\nhis early and cherished art, or the fading of the long dream that his\r\nheart “should find a heart to speak to.” On his last autumn afternoon,\r\nhe said what no one else would have dared to say for him: “I have had\r\na happy life.” Such it was, if we are to compute happiness by souls,\r\nand not by the incidents which befall them. What were the things\r\nwhich atoned to this reformer for the curse of a mind too sentient,\r\na heart never far from breaking? Over and above all amended and\r\namending abuses, the memory of the Rembrandts on the walls of Burleigh\r\nHouse; the waving crest of the Tuderley woods; the sky, the turf, “a\r\nwinding road, and a three-hours’ march to dinner”; the impersonator of\r\nRichard III. most to his mind, who lighted the stage, “and fought as\r\nif drunk with wounds”; and the figure (how pastoral and tender!) of\r\nthe shepherd-boy bringing a nest for his young mistress’s sky-lark,\r\n“not doomed to dip his wings in the dappled dawn.” What heresy to\r\nthe ancients would be this creed of poetic compensation! Montesquieu\r\nadhered to it; but hardly from baffled and impassioned Hazlitt, dying\r\nin his prime, would the avowal have been expected. Yet he had written\r\nalmost always, as Jeffrey saw, in “a happy intoxication.” Like the\r\nsundial, in one of the most charming among his miscellaneous essays, he\r\nkept count only of the hours of joy.\r\n\r\nHazlitt’s erratic levees among coffee-house wits and politicians, his\r\nslack dress, his rich and fitful talk, his beautiful fierce head, go to\r\nmake up any accurate impression of the man. Mr. P. G. Patmore has drawn\r\nhim for us; a strange portrait from a steady hand: in certain moods\r\n“an effigy of silence,” pale, anxious, emaciated, with an awful look\r\never and anon, like the thunder-cloud in a clear heaven, sweeping over\r\nhis features with still fury.[64] He was so much at the mercy of an\r\nexcitable and extra-sensitive organization that an accidental failure\r\nto return his salute upon the street, or, above all, the gaze of a\r\nservant as he entered a house, plunged him into an excess of wrath and\r\nmisery. Full, at other times, of scrupulous good faith and generosity,\r\nhe would, under the stress of a fancied hurt, say and write malicious\r\nthings about those he most honored. He must have been a general thorn\r\nin the flesh, for he had no tact whatever. “I love Henry,” said one\r\nof Thoreau’s friends, “but I cannot like him.” Shy, splenetic, with\r\nDryden’s “down look,” readier to give than to exchange, Hazlitt was\r\na riddle to strangers’ eyes. His deep voice seemed at variance with\r\nhis gliding step and his glance, bright but sullen; his hand felt\r\nas if it were the limp, cold fin of a fish, and was an unlooked-for\r\naccompaniment to the fiery soul warring everywhere with darkness, and\r\ndrenched in altruism. His habit of excessive tea-drinking, like Dr.\r\nJohnson’s, was to keep down sad thoughts. For sixteen years before he\r\ndied, from the day on which he formed his resolution, Hazlitt never\r\ntouched spirits of any kind. Profuse of money when he had it, he lacked\r\nheart, says Mr. Patmore, to live well. Wherever he dwelt there was\r\nwhat Carlyle, in Hunt’s case, called “tinkerdom”; his marriage, and\r\nhis residence under the august roof which had been Milton’s,[65] did\r\nnot mend matters for him. He covered the walls and mantel-pieces of\r\nLondon landladies, after the fashion of the French bohemian painters,\r\nwith samples of his noblest style; and the savor of yesterday’s potions\r\nof strong tea exhaled into their curtains. Never was there, despite\r\nhis confessional attitude, so non-communicative a soul. He never\r\ncorresponded with anybody; he never would walk arm in arm with anybody;\r\nhe never, perhaps from horror of the “patron” bogie, dedicated a book\r\nto anybody. De Quincey knew a man warmly disposed towards Hazlitt\r\nwho learned to shudder and dread daggers when poor Hazlitt, with a\r\ngesture habitual to him, thrust his right hand between the buttons\r\nof his waistcoat! And he once cheerfully requested of a cheerful\r\ncolleague: “Write a character of me for the next number. I want to\r\nknow why everybody has such a dislike to me.” As a social factor he\r\nwas something atrocious.[66] The most humane of men, his suspicions\r\nand shyings cut him off completely from humanity. The base war waged\r\nupon him by the great Tory magazines could not have affected him so\r\ndeeply that it changed his demeanor towards his fellows; for he had the\r\nmettle of a paladin, which no invective could break. But, alas! he had\r\n“the canker at the heart,” which is no fosterer of “the rose upon the\r\ncheek.”\r\n\r\nWith all this fever and heaviness in Hazlitt’s blood, he had a hearty\r\nlaugh, musical to hear. Haydon, in his exaggerated manner, reports an\r\nuncharitable conversation held with him once on the subject of Leigh\r\nHunt in Italy, during which the two misconstruing critics, in their\r\ngreat glee, “made more noise than all the coaches, wagons, and carts\r\noutside in Piccadilly.” His smile was singularly grave and sweet.\r\nMrs. Shelley wrote, on coming back to England, in her widowhood, and\r\nfinding him much changed: “His smile brought tears to my eyes; it\r\nwas like melancholy sunlight on a ruin.” A man who sincerely laughs\r\nand smiles is somewhat less than half a cynic. If there be any alive\r\nat this late hour who questions the genuineness of Hazlitt’s high\r\nspirits, he may be referred to the essay _On Going a Journey_, with\r\nthe pæan about “the gentleman in the parlor,” in the finest emulation\r\nof Cowley; but chiefly and constantly to _The Fight_, with its\r\nlingering De-Foe-like details, sprinkled, not in the least ironically,\r\nwith gold-dust of Chaucer and the later poets: the rich-ringing,\r\nunique _Fight_,[67] predecessor of Borrow’s famous burst about the\r\n“all tremendous bruisers” of _Lavengro_; and not to be matched in our\r\npeaceful literature save with the eulogy and epitaph of Jack Cavanagh,\r\nby the same hand. Divers hints have been circulated, within sixty-odd\r\nyears, that Mr. Hazlitt was a timid person, also that he had no turn\r\nfor jokes. These ingenious calumnies may be trusted to meet the fate of\r\nthe Irish pagan fairies, small enough at the start, whose punishment\r\nit is to dwindle ever and ever away, and point a moral to succeeding\r\ngenerations. Hazlitt’s paradoxes are not of malice prepense, but are\r\nthe ebullitions both of pure fun and of the truest philosophy. “The\r\nonly way to be reconciled with old friends is to part with them for\r\ngood.” “Goldsmith had the satisfaction of good-naturedly relieving\r\nthe necessities of others, and of being harassed to death with his\r\nown.” “Captain Burney had you at an advantage by never understanding\r\nyou.” Scattered mention of “people who live on their own estates and\r\non other people’s ideas”; of Jeremy Bentham, who had been translated\r\ninto French, “when it was the greatest pity in the world that he\r\nhad not been translated into English”; of the Coleridge of prose,\r\none of whose prefaces is “a masterpiece of its kind, having neither\r\nbeginning, middle, nor end”; and even of the “singular animal,”\r\nJohn Bull himself, since “being the beast he is has made a man of\r\nhim”:—these are no ill shots at the sarcastic. Congreve, with all his\r\nquicksilver wit, could not outgo Hazlitt on Thieves, _videlicet_: “Even\r\na highwayman, in the way of trade, may blow out your brains; but if he\r\nuses foul language at the same time, I should say he was no gentleman!”\r\nHazlitt’s sense of humor has quality, if not quantity. How was it this\r\nsame sense of humor, this fine-grained reticence, which wrote, nay,\r\nprinted, in 1823, the piteous and ludicrous canticle of the goddess\r\nSarah?\r\n\r\nHazlitt was a great pedestrian from his boyhood on, and, like\r\nGoldsmith, a fair hand at the game of fives, which he played by the\r\nday. Wherever he was, his pocket bulged with a book. It gave him keen\r\npleasure to set down the hour, the place, the mood, and the weather\r\nof various ecstatic first readings. He became acquainted with _Love\r\nfor Love_ in a low wainscoted tavern parlor between Farnham and Alton,\r\nlooking out upon a garden of larkspur, with a portrait of Charles\r\nII. crowning the chimney-piece; in his father’s house he fell across\r\n_Tom Jones_, “a child’s Tom Jones, an innocent creature”; he bought\r\nMilton and Burke at Shrewsbury, on the march; he looked up from Mrs.\r\nInchbald’s _Simple Story_, when its pathos grew too poignant, to\r\nfind “a summer shower dropping manna” on his head, and “an old crazy\r\nhand-organ playing _Robin Adair_.” And on April 10, 1798, his twentieth\r\nbirthday, he sat down to a volume of the _New Eloïse_, a book which\r\nkept its hold upon him, “at the inn of Llangollen, over a bottle of\r\nsherry and a cold chicken!” The frank epicurean catalogue, as of equal\r\nspiritual and corporeal delight, is worth notice. Do we not know that\r\nMr. Hazlitt had wood-partridges for supper, in his middle age, at\r\nthe Golden Cross, in Rastadt, near Mayence? Yet he failed to record\r\nwhat book lay by his plate, and distracted his attention from her\r\nwho had been a widow, and who was already planning her respectable\r\nexit from his society. Evidence that he was an eater of taste is to\r\nbe accumulated eagerly by his partisans, for eating is one of many\r\nengaging human characteristics which establish him as lovable—that is,\r\nposthumously lovable. Barry Cornwall was so jealously tender of his\r\nmemory that he would have forbidden any one to write of Hazlitt who\r\nhad not known him. As he did not warm miscellaneously to everybody,\r\nit followed that his friends were few. We do not forget which one\r\nof these, during their only difference, thought “to go to his grave\r\nwithout finding, or expecting to find, such another companion.”[68]\r\n\r\nHazlitt would have set himself down, by choice, as a metaphysician.\r\nUp to the time when his _Life of Napoleon_ was well in hand, he used\r\nto affirm that the anonymous _Principles of Human Action_, which he\r\ncompleted at twenty, in the literary style of the azoic age, was his\r\nbest work. He was rather proud, too, of the _Characteristics in the\r\nManner of Rochefoucauld’s Maxims_, his one dreary book, which contains\r\na couple of inductions worthy of Pascal, some sophistries and hollow\r\ncynicisms not native to Hazlitt’s brain, and a vast number of the very\r\nprofessorisms which he scouted. Maxims, indeed, are sown broadcast\r\nover his pages, which Alison the historian classified as better to\r\nquote than to read; but they gain by being incidental, and embedded in\r\nthe body of his fancies. His vein of original thought comes nowhere\r\nso perfectly into play as in its application to affairs. His pen is\r\nanything but abstruse,\r\n\r\n    “Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind.”\r\n\r\nHe did not recognize that to display his highest power he needed deeds\r\nand men, and their tangible outcome to be criticised. His preferences\r\nwere altogether wed to the past. In his essay on _Envy_ he excuses,\r\nwith a wise reflection, his comparative indifference to living writers:\r\n“We try to stifle the sense we have of their merit, not because they\r\nare new or modern, but because we are not sure they will ever be old.”\r\nOr, as Professor Wilson said of him, with tardy but winning kindness:\r\n“In short, if you want Hazlitt’s praise, you must die for it . . .\r\nand it is almost worth dying for.”[69] Yet what an eye he has for the\r\nidiosyncrasy at his elbow, be it in the individual or in the race!\r\nEvery contemporary of his, every painter, author, actor, and statesman\r\nof whom he cared to write at all, stands forth under his touch in\r\ndelicate and aggressive outlines from which a wind seems to blow\r\nback the mortal draperies, like a figure in a triumphal procession\r\nof Mantegna’s. His manner is essentially pictorial. His sketches of\r\nCobbett and of Northcote, in _The Spirit of Obligations_; of Johnson,\r\nin _The Periodical Essayists_; of Sir Thomas Browne and Bishop Taylor;\r\nand of Coleridge and Lamb, drawn more than once, with great power,\r\nfrom the life, will never be excelled. His philippic on _The Spirit\r\nof Monarchy_, or that on _The Regal Character_, is a pure vitriol\r\nflame, to scorch the necks of princes. His comments upon English\r\nand Continental types, if gathered from the necessarily promiscuous\r\n_Notes of a Journey_, would make a most diverting and illuminating\r\nduodecimo; the indictment of the French is especially masterly. _The\r\nSpirit of the Age_, _The Plain Speaker_, the Northcote book, _The\r\nEnglish Comic Writers_, and the noble and little-read _Political\r\nEssays_ are packed with vital personalities. So is _The Characters\r\nof Shakespeare’s Plays_, full of beautiful metaphysical analysis, as\r\nwell as of vivifying criticism. This lavish accumulation of material,\r\nnever put to use according to modern methods, must appear to some as a\r\ncollection of interest awaiting the broom and the hanging committee;\r\nbut until the end of time it will be a place of delight for the scholar\r\nand the lover of virtue. Hazlitt’s genius for assortment and sense of\r\nrelative values were not developed; he was in no wise a constructive\r\ncritic. Mr. R. H. Hutton complained once of Mr. Matthew Arnold that he\r\nranked his men, but did not portray them. Now Hazlitt, whose search is\r\nall for character, irrespective of the historic position, falls into\r\nthe opposite extreme: he portrays his men, but does not rank them. An\r\nattempt to break up into single file the merit which, with him, marches\r\nabreast, he would look upon as a bit of arrogance and rank impiety.\r\nHe has nothing to say of the quality which stamps Bavius as the best\r\nelegiac poet between Gray and Tennyson, or of the irony of Mævius,\r\nwhich would place his dramas, were it not for their loose construction,\r\nnext to Molière’s. He does not care a fig for comparisons; or, rather,\r\nhe wishes them left to the gods, and to his perceiving reader.\r\nMeanwhile, one face after another shines clear upon the wall, and\r\nbreathes enchantment on a passer-by.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to be severe with William Hazlitt, who was\r\ntowards himself so outspokenly severe. Every stricture upon him, as\r\nwell as every defence to be urged for it, may be taken out of his own\r\nmouth. Even the _Liber Amoris_, as must always have been discerned,\r\ndemonstrates not only his weakness, but his essential uprightness\r\nand innocence. His vindication is written large in _Depth and\r\nSuperficiality_, in _The Pleasures of Hating_, in _The Disadvantage of\r\nIntellectual Superiority_. His “true Hamlet” is as faithful a sketch\r\nof the author as is Newman’s celebrated definition of a gentleman.\r\nHazlitt says a tender word for Dr. Johnson’s prejudices which covers\r\nand explains many of his own. Who can call him irritable, recalling\r\nthe splendid exposition of merely selfish content, in the opening\r\nparagraphs of the essay on _Good Nature_? Yet, with all his lofty and\r\nendearing qualities, he had a warped and soured mind, a constitutional\r\ndisability to find pleasure in persons or in conditions which were\r\nquiescent. He would have every one as mettlesome and gloomily\r\nvigilant as he was himself. His perfectly proper apostrophe to the\r\nlazy Coleridge at Highgate to “start up in his promised likeness,\r\nand shake the pillared rottenness of the world,” is somewhat comic.\r\nHazlitt’s nerves never lost their tension; to the last hour of his\r\nlast sickness he was ready for a bout. Much of his personal grief\r\narose from his refusal to respect facts as facts, or to recognize in\r\nexisting evil, including the calamitous perfumed figure of Turveydrop\r\ngloriously reigning, what Vernon Lee calls “part of the mechanism\r\nfor producing good.” He bit at the quietist in a hundred ways, and\r\nwith choice venom. “There are persons who are never very far from the\r\ntruth, because the slowness of their faculties will not suffer them to\r\nmake much progress in error. These are ‘persons of great judgment.’\r\nThe scales of the mind are pretty sure to remain even when there is\r\nnothing in them.” He was a natural snarler at sunshiny people with full\r\npockets and feudal ideas, like Sir Walter, who got along with the ogre\r\nWhat Is, and even asked him to dine. In fact, William Hazlitt hated\r\na great many things with the utmost enthusiasm, and he was impolite\r\nenough to say so, in and out of season. The Established Church and all\r\nits tenets and traditions were only less monstrous in his eyes than\r\nlegendry, mediævalism, and “the shoal of friars.” He knew, from actual\r\nexperience, the loyalty and purity of the early Unitarians, and he\r\npraised these with all his heart and tongue. As far as one can make\r\nout, he had not the remotest conception of the breadth and texture\r\nof Christianity as a whole. His theory, for he practised no creed\r\nexcept the cheap one of universal dissent, was a faint-colored local\r\nPuritanism; and that, as the Merry Monarch (an excellent judge of what\r\nwas not what!) reminds us, is “no religion for a gentleman.” But more\r\nthan this, Hazlitt had no apprehension of the supernatural in anything;\r\nhe was very unspiritual. It is curious to see how he sidles away from\r\nthe finer English creatures whom he had to handle. Sidney almost repels\r\nhim, and he dismisses Shelley, on one occasion, with an inadequate but\r\napt allusion to the “hectic flutter” of his verse. Living in a level\r\ncountry with no outlook upon eternity, and no deep insight into the\r\nhuman past, nor fully understanding those who had wider vision and more\r\ninstructed utterance than his own, it follows that beside such men as\r\nthose just named, then as now, Hazlitt has a crude villageous mien. He\r\nhad his refined sophistications; chief among them was a surpassing love\r\nof natural beauty. But he relished, on the whole, the beef and beer of\r\nlife. The normal was what he wrote of with “gusto”; a word he never\r\ntired of using, and which one must use in speaking of himself. While he\r\nis an admirable arbiter of what is or is not truly intellectual, he is\r\nall at sea when he has to discuss, for instance, emotional poetry, or,\r\nwhat is yet more difficult to him, poetry purely poetic; its inevitable\r\ntouch of the fantastic, the mystical, puts his wits completely to rout.\r\nThe stern, lopsided, and magnificent article on Shelley’s _Posthumous\r\nPoems_ in the _Edinburgh Review_ for July, 1824, and his impatience\r\nwith Coleridge at his best, perfectly exemplify this limitation.\r\nDespite his partiality for Rousseau and certain of the early Italian\r\npainters, most of the men whose genius he seizes upon and exalts with\r\nunerring success are the men who display, along with enormous acumen\r\nand power, nothing which betokens the morbid and exquisite thing we\r\nhave learned to call modern culture. Hazlitt, fortunately for us,\r\nwas not over-civilized, had no cinque-cento instincts, and would\r\nhave groaned aloud over such hedonism as Mr. Pater’s. Homespun and\r\nmanly as he is, who can help feeling that his was but an imperfect\r\ndevelopment? that, as Mr. Arnold said so paternally of Byron, “he\r\ndid not know enough”? He lacked both mental discipline and moral\r\ngovernance. He has the wayward and appealing Celtic utterance; the\r\nmanner made of largeness and simpleness, all shot and interwoven with\r\nthe hues of romanticism. Prodigal that he is, he cannot stoop to build\r\nup his golden piecemeal, or to clinch his generalizations, thrown down\r\nloosely, side by side. Esoteric thrift is not in him, nor the spirit of\r\nco-operation, nor the sweetest of artistic anxieties, that of marching\r\nin line. He has a knight-errant pen; his glad and chivalrous services\r\nto literature resemble those of an outlaw to the commonwealth. Despite\r\nhis personal value, he stands detached; he is episodic, and represents\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n    “The earth hath bubbles as the water hath,\r\n     And this is of them.”\r\n\r\nHe misses the white station of a classic; for the classics have\r\nequipoise, and inter-relationship. But it is great cause for\r\nthankfulness that William Hazlitt cannot be made other than he is. Time\r\ncan not take away his height and his red-gold garments, bestow on him\r\nthe “smoother head of hair” which Lamb prayed for, and shrivel him into\r\none of several very wise and weary _précieux_. No: he stalks apart in\r\nstate, the splendid Pasha of English letters.\r\n\r\nHazlitt boasts, and permissibly, of genuine disinterestedness: “If you\r\nwish to see me perfectly calm,” he remarks somewhere, “cheat me in a\r\nbargain, or tread on my toes.”[70] But he cannot promise the same\r\nbehavior for a sophism repeated in his presence, or a truth repelled.\r\nIn his sixth year he had been taken, with his brother and sister, to\r\nAmerica, and he says that he never afterwards got out of his mouth the\r\ndelicious tang of a frost-bitten New England barberry. It is tolerably\r\nsure that the blowy and sunny atmosphere of the young republic of\r\n1783-7 got into him also. Liberalism was his birthright. He flourishes\r\nhis fighting colors; he trembles with eagerness to break a lance with\r\nthe arch-enemies; he is a champion, from his cradle, against class\r\nprivilege, of slaves who know not what they are, nor how to wish for\r\nliberty. But he cannot do all this in the laughing Horatian way; he\r\ncannot keep cool; he cannot mind his object. If he could, he would be\r\nthe white devil of debate. There are times when he speaks, as does\r\nDr. Johnson, out of all reason, because aware of the obstinacy and the\r\nbad faith of his hearers. Morals are too much in his mind, and, after\r\ntheir wont, they spoil his manners. Like the Caroline Platonist, Henry\r\nMore, he “has to cut his way through a crowd of thoughts as through a\r\nwood.” His temper breaks like a rocket, in little lurid smoking stars,\r\nover every ninth page; he lays about him at random; he raises a dust of\r\nside-issues. Hazlitt sometimes reminds one of Burke himself gone off\r\nat half-cock. He will not step circumspectly from light to light, from\r\nsecurity to security. Some of his very best essays, as has been noted,\r\nhave either no particular subject, or fail to follow the one they have.\r\nNor is he any the less attractive if he be heated, if he be swearing\r\n\r\n    “By the blood so basely shed\r\n     Of the pride of Norfolk’s line,”\r\n\r\nor scornfully settling accounts of his own with the asinine public.\r\nWhen he is not driven about by his moods, Hazlitt is set upon his fact\r\nalone; which he thinks is the sole concern of a prose-writer. Grace and\r\nforce are collateral affairs. “In seeking for truth,” he says proudly,\r\nin words fit to be the epitome of his career, “I sometimes found\r\nbeauty.”\r\n\r\n_The Edinburgh Review_, in an article written while Hazlitt was in the\r\nfull of his activity, summed up his shortcomings. “There are no great\r\nleading principles of taste to give singleness to his aims, nor any\r\ncentral points in his mind around which his feelings may revolve and\r\nhis imaginations cluster. There is no sufficient distinction between\r\nhis intellectual and his imaginative faculties. He confounds the truths\r\nof imagination with those of fact, the processes of argument with\r\nthose of feeling, the immunities of intellect with those of virtue.”\r\nHere is an admirable arraignment, which goes to the heart of the\r\nmatter. Hazlitt himself corroborates it in a confession of gallant\r\ndirectness: “I say what I think; I think what I feel.” It is this fatal\r\nconfusion which makes his course now rapid and clear, anon clogged with\r\nvagaries, as if his rudder had run into a mesh of sea-weed; it is\r\nthis which deflects his judgments, and leads him, in the shrewd phrase\r\nof a modern critic, to praise the right things for the wrong reasons.\r\nHazlitt’s prejudices are very instructive, even while he bewails\r\nLandor’s or Cobbett’s, and tells you, as it were, with a tear in his\r\neye, when he has done berating the French, that, after all, they are\r\nCatholics; and as for manners, “Catholics must be allowed to carry it,\r\nall over the world!” His exquisite treatment of Northcote, a winning\r\nold sharper for whom he cared nothing, is all due to his looking like\r\na Titian portrait. So with the great Duke: Hazlitt hated the sight\r\nof him, “as much for his pasteboard visor of a face as for anything\r\nelse.” One of his justifications for adoring Napoleon was, that at a\r\nlevee a young English officer named Lovelace drew from him an endearing\r\nrecognition: “I perceive, sir, that you bear the name of the hero of\r\nRichardson’s romance.” If you look like a Titian portrait, if you read\r\nand remember Richardson, you may trust a certain author, who knows a\r\ndistinction when he sees it, to set you up for the idol of posterity.\r\nHazlitt thought Mr. Wordsworth’s long and immobile countenance\r\nresembled that of a horse; and it is not impossible that this\r\nconviction, twin-born with that other that Mr. Wordsworth was a mighty\r\npoet, is responsible for various gibes at the august contemporary whose\r\nmemory owes so much to his pen in other moods.\r\n\r\nHe is the most ingenuous and agreeable egoist we have had since the\r\nseventeenth-century men. It must be remembered how little he was in\r\ntouch outwardly with social and civic affairs; how he was content to\r\nbe the always young looker-on. There was nothing for him to do but\r\nfall back, under given conditions, upon his own capacious entity. The\r\nautomaton called William Hazlitt is to him a toy made to his hand,\r\nto be reached without effort; the digest of all his study and the\r\napplicable test of all his assumptions. He knew himself; he could, and\r\ndid, with decorum, approve or chastise himself in open court. “His\r\nlife was of humanity the sphere.” His “I” has a strong constituency\r\nin the other twenty-five initials. In this sense, and in our current\r\ncant, Hazlitt is nothing if not subjective, super-personal. His sort of\r\nsentimentalism is an anomaly in Northern literature, even in the age\r\nwhen nearly every literary Englishman of note was variously engaged\r\nin baring his breast. Whether he would carp or sigh, he will still\r\nhold you by the button, as he held host and guest, master and valet,\r\nto pour into their adjacent ears the mad extravagances of the _Liber\r\nAmoris_. He gets a little tired at his desk, after battling for hours\r\nwith the slow and stupid in behalf of the beauty ever-living; he wants\r\nfresh air and a reverie; he must digress or die. And from abstractions\r\nbardic as Carlyle’s, he runs gladly to his own approved self. This very\r\ncircumstance, which lends Hazlitt’s pages their curious blur and stain,\r\nis the same which stamps his individuality, and gives those who are\r\ndrawn towards him at all an unspeakably hearty relish for his company.\r\nWhat shall we call it?—the habit, not maudlin in him, of speaking out,\r\nof draining his well of emotion for the benefit of the elect; nay, even\r\nof delicate lyric whimperings, beside which\r\n\r\n    “Poore Petrarch’s long-deceasèd woes”\r\n\r\ntake on a tinsel glamour. As the dancing-girl carries her jewels,\r\nevery one in sight as she moves, so our “Faustus, that was wont to\r\nmake the schools ring with _Sic probo_,” steps into the forum jingling\r\nand twinkling with personalia. He is quite aware of the figure he\r\nmay cut: he does not stumble into an intimacy with you because he is\r\nabsent-minded, or because he is liable to an attack of affectation. He\r\nis as conscious as Poussin’s giants, whom he once described as “seated\r\non the tops of craggy mountains, playing idly on their Pan’s pipes, and\r\nknowing the beginning and the end of their own story.” Many sentences\r\nof his, from their structure, might be attributed to Coleridge, the\r\nsingle person from whom Hazlitt admits to have learned anything;[71]\r\nbut there is no mistaking his _note émue_: that is as obvious as the\r\nsyncopations in a Scotch tune, or the long eyes of Orcagna’s saints.\r\n\r\nHe wishes you to know, at every breathing-space, “how ill’s all here\r\nabout my heart; but ’tis no matter.” Laying by or taking up an old\r\nprint or folio, he loosens some fond confidence to that surprised\r\nnovice, the common reader. Like Shelley here, as in a few other\r\naffectionate absurdities, the prince of prose, turning from his proper\r\naffairs, assures you that he, too, is human, hoping, unhappy; he also\r\nhas lived in Arcadia. It is in such irrelevancies that he is fully\r\nhimself, Hazlitt freed, Hazlitt autobiographic, “his chariot-wheels\r\nhot by driving fast.”[72] Who can forget the parentheses in his advices\r\nto his little son, about the scholar having neither mate nor fellow,\r\nand the god of love clapping his wings upon the river-bank to mock him\r\nas he passes by? Or the noble and moving passage in _The Pleasures of\r\nPainting_, beginning with “My father was willing to sit as long as I\r\npleased,” and ending with the longing for the revolution of the great\r\nPlatonic year, that those times might come over again! He freshens with\r\nhis own childhood the garden of larkspur and mignonette at Walworth,\r\nand “the rich notes of the thrush that startle the ear of winter . . .\r\ndear in themselves, and dearer for the sake of what is departed.” You\r\ncare not so much for the placid stream by Peterborough as for his own\r\nwistful pilgrimage to the nigh farmhouse gate, where the ten-year-old\r\nGrace Loftus (his much-beloved mother, who survived him) used to gaze\r\nupon the setting sun. And in a choric outburst of praise for Mrs.\r\nSiddons, the splendor seems to culminate less in “her majestic form\r\nrising up against misfortune, an antagonist power to it” (what a truly\r\nShakespearean breadth is in that description!); less in the sight of\r\nher name on the play-bill, “drawing after it a long trail of Eastern\r\nglory, a joy and felicity unutterable,” than in the widening dream of\r\nthe happy lad in the pit, in his sovereign vision “of waning time, of\r\nPersian thrones and them that sat on them”; in the human life which\r\nappeared to him, of a sudden, “far from indifferent,” and in his\r\n“overwhelming and drowning flood of tears.” He can beautify the evening\r\nstar itself, this innovator, who records that after a tranced and\r\nbusy day at the easel, the day of Austerlitz, he watched it set over\r\na poor man’s cottage with other thoughts and feelings than he shall\r\never have again. There is nothing of _le moi haïssable_ in all this. It\r\nis deliberate naturalism; the rebellion against didactics and “tall\r\ntalk,” the milestone of a return, parallel with that of Wordsworth,\r\nto the fearless contemplation of plain and near things. But in a\r\nprofessing logician, is it not somewhat peculiar? When has even a poet\r\nso centred the universe in his own heart, without offence?\r\n\r\nHazlitt threw away his brush, as a heroic measure, because he foresaw\r\nbut a middling success. Many canvases he cut into shreds, in a fury\r\nof dissatisfaction with himself. Northcote, however, thought his lack\r\nof patience had spoiled a great painter. He was too full of worship\r\nof the masters to make an attentive artisan. The sacrifice, like all\r\nhis sacrifices, great or small, left nothing behind but sweetness,\r\nthe unclouded love of excellence, and the capacity of rejoicing at\r\nanother’s attaining whatever he had missed. But the sense of disparity\r\nbetween supreme intellectual achievement and that which is only\r\npartial and relative, albeit of equal purity, followed him like a\r\nfrenzy. Comparison is yet more difficult in literature than in art,\r\nand Hazlitt could take some satisfaction in the results of his second\r\nardor. He felt his power most, perhaps, as a critic of the theatre.\r\nEnglish actors owe him an incalculable debt, and their best spirits\r\nare not unmindful of it. He was reasonably assured of the duration and\r\nincrease of his fame. Has he not, in one of his headstrong digressions,\r\ncalled the thoughts in his _Table-Talk_ “founded as rock, free as\r\nair, the tone like an Italian picture?” Even there, however, the\r\nfaint-heartedness natural to every true artist troubled him. He went\r\nhome in despair from the spectacle of the Indian juggler, “in his\r\nwhite dress and tightened turban,” tossing the four brass balls. “To\r\nmake them revolve round him at certain intervals, like the planets in\r\ntheir spheres, to make them chase one another like sparkles of fire, or\r\nshoot up like flowers or meteors, to throw them behind his back, and\r\ntwine them round his neck like ribbons or like serpents; to do what\r\nappears an impossibility, and to do it with all the ease, the grace,\r\nthe carelessness imaginable; to laugh at, to play with the glittering\r\nmockeries, to follow them with his eye as if he could fascinate them\r\nwith its lambent fire, or as if he had only to see that they kept time\r\nto the music on the stage—there is something in all this which he who\r\ndoes not admire may be quite sure he never really admired anything in\r\nthe whole course of his life. It is skill surmounting difficulty, and\r\nbeauty triumphing over skill. . . . It makes me ashamed of myself. I\r\nask what there is that I can do as well as this? Nothing.” A third\r\nperson must give another answer. The whole passage offers a very\r\nexquisite parallel; for in just such a daring, varied, and magical\r\nway can William Hazlitt write. The astounding result, “which costs\r\nnothing,” is founded, in each case, upon the toil of a lifetime.\r\nHazlitt’s style is an incredible thing. It is not, like Lamb’s, of one\r\nwarp and woof. It soars to the rhetorical sublime, and drops to hard\r\nSaxon slang. It is for all the world, and not only for specialists. Its\r\nrange and change incorporate the utmost of many men. The trenchant\r\nsweep, the simplicity and point of Newman at his best, are matched\r\nby the pages on _Cobbett_, on _Fox_, and _On the Regal Character_;\r\nand there is, to choose but one opposite instance, in the paper _On\r\nthe Unconsciousness of Genius_, touching Correggio, a fragment of\r\npure eloquence of a very ornate sort, whose onward bound, glow, and\r\nvolley can give Mr. Swinburne’s _Essays and Studies_ a look as of\r\nsails waiting for the wind. The same hand which fills a brief with\r\nepic cadences and invocations overwrought, throws down, often without\r\nan adjective, sentence after sentence of ringing steel: “Fashion is\r\ngentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken\r\nby it.” “It is not the omission of individual circumstance, but the\r\nomission of general truth, which constitutes the little, the deformed,\r\nand the short-lived in art.” The man’s large voice in these aphorisms\r\nis Hazlitt’s unmistakably. If it be not as novel to this generation as\r\nif he were but just entering the lists of authorship, it is because his\r\nfecundating mind has been long enriching at second-hand the libraries\r\nof the English world. He comes forth, like another outrider, Rossetti,\r\nso far behind his heralds and disciples, that his mannered utterance\r\nseems familiar, and an echo of theirs. For it may be said at last,\r\nthanks to the numerous reprints of the last seven years, and thanks\r\nto a few competent critics, whom Mr. Stevenson leads, that Hazlitt’s\r\nrobust work is in a fair way to be known and appraised, by a public\r\nwhich is a little less unworthy of him than his own. His method is\r\nentirely unscientific, and therefore archaic. If we can profit no\r\nlonger by him, we can get out of him cheer and delight: and these\r\nprofit unto immortality. Meanwhile, what mere “maker of beautiful\r\nEnglish” shall be pitted against him there where he sits, the despair\r\nof a generation of experts, continually tossing the four brass balls?\r\n\r\nIt has been said often by shallow reviewers, and is said sometimes\r\nstill, that Hazlitt’s style aims at effect; as if an effect must not\r\nbe won, without aiming, by a “born man of letters,” as Mr. Saintsbury\r\ndescribed him, “who could not help turning into literature everything\r\nhe touched.”[73] The “effect,” under given conditions, is manifest,\r\nunavoidable. Once let Hazlitt speak, as he speaks ever, in the warmth\r\nof conviction, and what an intoxicating music begins!—wild as that of\r\nthe gypsies, and with the same magnet-touch on the sober senses: enough\r\nto subvert all “criticism and idle distinction,” and to bring back\r\nthose Theban times when the force of a sound, rather than masons and\r\nsurveyors, sent the very walls waltzing into their places.\r\n\r\nIn the face of diction so joyously clear as his, so sumptuous and\r\nsplendid, it is well to endorse Mr. Ruskin, that “no right style\r\nwas ever founded save out of a sincere heart.” It can never be\r\nsaid of William Hazlitt, as Dean Trench well said of those other\r\n“great stylists,” Landor and De Quincey, that he had a lack of moral\r\nearnestness. What he was determined to impress upon his reader, during\r\nthe quarter-century while he held a pen, was not that he was knowing,\r\nnot that he was worthy of the renown and fortune which passed him by,\r\nbut only that he had rectitude and a consuming passion for good. He\r\ndeclares aloud that his escutcheon has no bar-sinister: he has not\r\nsold himself; he has spoken truth in and out of season; he has honored\r\nthe excellent at his own risk and cost; he has fought for a principle\r\nand been slain for it, from his youth up. His sole boast is proven.\r\nIn a far deeper sense than Leigh Hunt, for whom he forged the lovely\r\ncompliment, he was “the visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue,” and\r\nthe captain of those who stood fast, in a hostile day, for ignored and\r\neternal ideals. The best thing to be said of him, the thing for which,\r\nin Haydon’s phrase, “everybody must love him,” is that he himself loved\r\njustice and hated iniquity. He shared the groaning of the spirit\r\nafter mortal welfare with Swift and Fielding, with Shelley and Matthew\r\nArnold, with Carlyle and Ruskin; he was corroded with cares and desires\r\nnot his own. Beside this intense devotedness, what personal flaw will\r\nultimately show? The host who figure in the Roman martyrology hang all\r\ntheir claim upon the fact of martyrdom, and, according to canon law,\r\nneed not have been saints in their lifetime at all. So with such souls\r\nas his: in the teeth of a thousand acknowledged imperfections in life\r\nor in art, they remain our exemplars. Let them do what they will, at\r\nsome one stroke they dignify this earth. It is not Hazlitt, “the born\r\nman of letters” alone, but Hazlitt the born humanist, who bequeaths us,\r\nfrom his England of coarse misconception and abuse, a memory like a\r\nloadstar, and a name which is a toast to be drunk standing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] The article on _The Fine Arts_ in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ is\r\nsigned “W. H.”\r\n\r\n[59] Mrs. Hazlitt the first, it would appear, undertook to verify\r\nher husband’s quotations for him. His favorite metaphor, “Like the\r\ntide which flows on to the Propontic, and knows no ebb,” must have\r\npassed many times under her eye. Any reference to Othello himself, in\r\nthe great scene of Act III., would have shown four lines for William\r\nHazlitt’s explicit one.\r\n\r\n[60] Some of Hazlitt’s comments on women are full of unconscious humor.\r\nIn _Great and Little Things_ he admits being snubbed by the fair, and\r\nadds with grandiloquence: “I took a pride in my disgrace, and concluded\r\nthat I had elsewhere my inheritance!”\r\n\r\n[61] In the National Portrait Gallery, London.\r\n\r\n[62] _Blackwood’s_, in the charming fashion of the time, repeatedly\r\nrefers to Hazlitt’s “pimples”; and Byron credited and supplemented the\r\nallegation. Hazlitt himself says somewhere “that to lay a thing to\r\na person’s charge from which he is perfectly free, shows spirit and\r\ninvention!” The calumny is not worth mention, except as a fair specimen\r\nof the journalistic methods against which literary men had to contend\r\nsome eighty years ago.\r\n\r\n[63] Lamb had been his groomsman twenty-two years before, at the Church\r\nof St. Andrew, Holborn, “and like to have been turned out several times\r\nduring the ceremony; anything awful makes me laugh!” as he confessed in\r\na letter to Southey in 1815.\r\n\r\n[64] Orrery had seen this same bitter indignation overwhelm Swift at\r\ntimes, “so that it is scarcely possible for human features to carry in\r\nthem more terror and austerity.”\r\n\r\n[65] At 19 York Street, Westminster. The house, with its tablet “To the\r\nPrince of Poets” set by Hazlitt himself, was destroyed in 1877.\r\n\r\n[66] A snappy unpublished letter to Hunt, sold among the Hazlitt\r\npapers at Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge’s, in the late autumn of 1893,\r\ncomplains bitterly of kind Basil Montagu, who had once put off a\r\nproffered visit from Hazlitt, on the ground that a party of other\r\nguests was expected. The deterred one was naturally wroth. “Yet after\r\nthis, I am not to look at him a little _in abstracto_! This is what has\r\nsoured me and made me sick of friendship and acquaintanceship.” Hazlitt\r\nconfounded cause and effect. He was unwelcome in general gatherings\r\nwhere his genius was unappreciated; and we may be sure Montagu\r\nwas sorry for it when, in the interests of concord, he held up so\r\ndeprecating and inhospitable a hand. But among those who nursed Hazlitt\r\nin his last illness, Basil Montagu was not the least loyal.\r\n\r\n[67] _The Fight_ appeared in the _New Monthly Magazine_ in 1822. It\r\nwas itself antedated by _The Fancy_ of John Hamilton Reynolds, Keats’s\r\nfriend and Hood’s brother-in-law, which was printed in 1820. The jolly\r\niambics are as inspired as the essay. “P. C.” is, of course, Pugilistic\r\nClub.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is life! to see a proud And dauntless man step, full of hopes,\r\nUp to the P. C. stakes and ropes, Throw in his hat, and with a spring\r\nGet gallantly within the ring; Eye the wide crown, and walk awhile\r\nTaking all cheerings with a smile; To see him strip; his well-trained\r\nform, White, glowing, muscular, and warm, All beautiful in conscious\r\npower, Relaxed and quiet, till the hour; His glossy and transparent\r\nframe, In radiant plight to strive for fame! To look upon the clean\r\nshap’d limb In silk and flannel clothèd trim; While round the waist\r\nthe kerchief tied Makes the flesh glow in richer pride. ’Tis more than\r\nlife to watch him hold His hand forth, tremulous yet bold, Over his\r\nsecond’s, and to clasp His rival’s in a quiet grasp; To watch the noble\r\nattitude He takes, the crowd in breathless mood; And then to see, with\r\nadamant start, The muscles set, and the great heart Hurl a courageous\r\nsplendid light Into the eye, and then—the FIGHT!”\r\n\r\nBut this is general: Hazlitt is specific. His particular Fight was the\r\ngreat one between Neate of Bristol and Tom Hickman the Gasman, Neate\r\nbeing the victor. On May 20, 1823, Neate met Spring of Hertfordshire\r\n(so translated out of his natural patronymic of Winter), in a contest\r\nfor the championship, and Neate himself went under. This latter battle\r\nwas mock-heroically celebrated by Maginn in _Blackwood’s_, and Hood’s\r\ncasual meteorological simile heaped up honors on the winner:\r\n\r\n“The Spring! I shrink and shudder at her name. For why? I find her\r\nbreath a bitter blighter, And suffer from her blows as if they came\r\nFrom Spring the fighter!”\r\n\r\nSo that literature may be said to have set close to the ropes in those\r\ndays, from first to last.\r\n\r\n[68] Lamb, in “_A Letter to R. Southey, Esq._”\r\n\r\n[69] The man of Martial’s epigram had other “views.” The capital\r\ntranslation is Dr. Goldwin Smith’s:\r\n\r\n“Vacerra lauds no living poet’s lays, But for departed genius keeps his\r\npraise. I, alas, live; nor deem it worth my while To die, that I may\r\nwin Vacerra’s smile.”\r\n\r\n[70] This was the spirit of Henry Fielding on his last voyage, hoisted\r\naboard among the watermen at Redcliffe, and hearing his emaciated body\r\nmade the subject of jeers and laughter. “No man who knew me,” he writes\r\nin his journal, “will think I conceived any personal resentment at this\r\nbehavior; but it was a lively picture of that cruelty and inhumanity\r\nin the nature of man which I have often contemplated with concern, and\r\nwhich leads the mind into a train of very uncomfortable and melancholy\r\nthoughts.” It is a fine passage, and a strong heart, not given to\r\nboasting, penned it. Poor Hazlitt could not bear even an unintentional\r\nslight without imputing diabolical malice to the offender. Yet it was\r\ncertainly true that, in his saner hours, he could suffer personal\r\ndiscomfort in public without flinching, and deplore the habit which\r\nimposed it, rather than the act.\r\n\r\n[71] If Hazlitt conveyed some of his best mannerisms from Coleridge,\r\nnot always transmuting them, surely the balance may be said to be\r\neven when one discovers later in Hartley Coleridge such an easy\r\ninherited use of Hazlitt’s “flail of gold” as is exemplified in this\r\nsummary of Roger Ascham’s career. “There was a primitive honesty, a\r\nkindly innocence about this good old scholar, which gave a personal\r\ninterest to the homeliest details of his life. He had the rare\r\nfelicity of passing through the worst of times without persecution and\r\nwithout dishonor. He lived with princes and princesses, prelates and\r\ndiplomatists, without offence as without ambition. Though he enjoyed\r\nthe smiles of royalty, his heart was none the worse, and his fortunes\r\nlittle the better.”\r\n\r\n[72] The quotation is from Coleridge, and it was applied by him to\r\nDryden. Hazlitt himself unconsciously expanded and spoiled it in his\r\nessay on _Burke_. “The wheels of his imagination did not catch fire\r\nfrom the rottenness of the material, but from the rapidity of their\r\nmotion.”\r\n\r\n[73] The Rev. H. R. Haweis has another characterization of these\r\nbreathing and burning pages: “long and tiresome essays by Hazlitt.”\r\nSo they are, sure enough, if only you be endowed to think so! Hazlitt\r\nhimself gives the diverting fact for what it is worth, that “three\r\nchimney-sweeps meeting three Chinese in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, they\r\nlaughed at one another till they were ready to drop down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR HENRI\r\n\r\n    A Foot-note to French History.
