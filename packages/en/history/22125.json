Many other alterations have been\r\nrequired by the breaking up of private collections. In several instances\r\nit has been impossible to trace pictures to their new homes, and of such\r\nthe more important remain under the names of their former owners. To the\r\nlists of painters have been added Beccaruzzi, Caprioli, Polidoro\r\nLanzani, Rocco Marconi, Andrea Schiavone, and Girolamo da Treviso,\r\nartists important enough to be missed, but of merit so unequal that only\r\ntheir more interesting works are here given. But the bulk of new\r\nadditions, amounting to a third as much again as was comprised in the\r\nlast edition, is of pictures in the various provincial galleries and\r\nprivate collections of Great Britain, France, and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe author takes great pleasure in acknowledging his indebtedness to Mr.\r\nHerbert F. Cook for invaluable aid in visiting some of the almost\r\nnumberless British collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following essay owes its origin to the author's belief that Venetian\r\npainting is the most complete expression in art of the Italian\r\nRenaissance. The Renaissance is even more important typically than\r\nhistorically. Historically it may be looked upon as an age of glory or\r\nof shame according to the different views entertained of European events\r\nduring the past five centuries. But typically it stands for youth, and\r\nyouth alone--for intellectual curiosity and energy grasping at the whole\r\nof life as material which it hopes to mould to any shape.\r\n\r\nEvery generation has an innate sympathy with some epoch of the past\r\nwherein it seems to find itself foreshadowed. Science has of late\r\nrevealed and given much, but its revelation and gifts are as nothing to\r\nthe promise it holds out of constant acquisition and perpetual growth,\r\nof everlasting youth. We ourselves, because of our faith in science and\r\nthe power of work, are instinctively in sympathy with the Renaissance.\r\nOur problems do not seem so easy to solve, our tasks are more difficult\r\nbecause our vision is wider, but the spirit which animates us was\r\nanticipated by the spirit of the Renaissance, and more than anticipated.\r\nThat spirit seems like the small rough model after which ours is being\r\nfashioned.\r\n\r\nItalian painting interests many of us more than the painting of any\r\nother school not because of its essential superiority, but because it\r\nexpressed the Renaissance; and Venetian painting is interesting above\r\nall because it was at Venice alone that this expression attained\r\nperfection. Elsewhere, particularly in Florence, it died away before it\r\nfound complete utterance.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the main idea clearly before the mind of the reader, to\r\nshow him how the Renaissance reveals itself in Venetian painting, the\r\nintroduction of anything not strictly relevant to the subject has been\r\navoided. The salient points once perceived and connected with the more\r\nimportant painters, the reader will find no difficulty in seeing the\r\nproper place of any given work by a great master, or the relative\r\nimportance of those second-and third-rate painters of whom no special\r\nmention has been made because they are comprised within what has been\r\nsaid about the greater artists.\r\n\r\nBut happily art is too great and too vital a subject to be crowded into\r\nany single formula; and a formula that would, without distorting our\r\nentire view of Italian art in the fifteenth century, do full justice to\r\nsuch a painter as Carlo Crivelli, does not exist. He takes rank with the\r\nmost genuine artists of all times and countries, and does not weary even\r\nwhen \"great masters\" grow tedious. He expresses with the freedom and\r\nspirit of Japanese design a piety as wild and tender as Jacopo da\r\nTodi's, a sweetness of emotion as sincere and dainty as of a Virgin and\r\nChild carved in ivory by a French craftsman of the fourteenth century.\r\nThe mystic beauty of Simone Martini, the agonized compassion of the\r\nyoung Bellini, are embodied by Crivelli in forms which have the strength\r\nof line and the metallic lustre of old Satsuma or lacquer, and which are\r\nno less tempting to the touch. Crivelli must be treated by himself and\r\nas the product of stationary, if not reactionary, conditions. Having\r\nlived most of his life far away from the main currents of culture, in a\r\nprovince where St. Bernardino had been spending his last energies in the\r\nendeavour to call the world back to the ideals of an infantile\r\ncivilisation, Crivelli does not belong to a movement of constant\r\nprogress, and therefore is not within the scope of this work.\r\n\r\nTo make the essay useful as a handbook to Venetian painting, lists have\r\nbeen appended of the works, in and out of Italy, by the principal\r\nVenetian masters. These lists do not pretend to absolute completeness.\r\nOnly such private collections have been mentioned as are well known and\r\naccessible to students, although in the case of very rare painters all\r\nof their known works are given, and even such as are of doubtful\r\nauthenticity are alluded to. The author has seen and carefully\r\nconsidered all the pictures he mentions, except one or two at St.\r\nPetersburg, which are, however, well known from the photographs of MM.\r\nBraun & Cie. The attributions are based on the results of the most\r\nrecent research. Even such painstaking critics of some years ago as\r\nMessrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle laboured under terrible disadvantages,\r\nbecause most of their work was done at a time when travelling was much\r\nslower than it has now become, and when photography was not sufficiently\r\nperfected to be of great service. Rapid transit and isochromatic\r\nphotography are beginning to enable the student to make of\r\nconnoisseurship something like an exact science. To a certain extent,\r\ntherefore, Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle have been superseded, and to a\r\ngreat degree supplemented by the various writings of Morelli, Richter,\r\nFrizzoni, and others. The author takes pleasure in acknowledging his\r\nindebtedness to the first systematic writers on Italian painting no less\r\nthan to the perfectors of the new critical method, now adopted by nearly\r\nall serious students of Italian art. To the founder of the new\r\ncriticism, the late Giovanni Morelli, and to his able successor, Dr.\r\nGustavo Frizzoni, the author feels bound to ascribe many of his\r\nattributions, although a number are based on independent research, and\r\nfor these he alone is responsible. Special thanks are due to a dear\r\nfriend, Enrico Costa, for placing his notes of a recent visit to Madrid\r\nat the author's disposal. They have been used, with a confidence\r\nwarranted by Signor Costa's unrivalled connoisseurship, to supplement\r\nthe author's own notes, taken some years ago.\r\n\r\nHaving noted the dependence of scientific art study upon isochromatic\r\nphotography, the author is happy to take this opportunity of expressing\r\nhis gratitude to such able photographers as Löwy of Vienna, Tamme of\r\nDresden, Marcozzi of Milan, Alinari Bros. of Florence, and Dominic\r\nAnderson of Rome, all of whom have devoted themselves with special zeal\r\nto the paintings of the Venetian masters. The author is peculiarly\r\nindebted to Signor Anderson for having materially assisted his studies\r\nby photographing many pictures which at present have a scientific rather\r\nthan a popular interest.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece is a reproduction of Giorgione's \"Shepherd\" at Hampton\r\nCourt, a picture which perhaps better than any other expresses the\r\nRenaissance at the most fascinating point of its course. The author is\r\nindebted to Mr. Sidney Colvin for permission to make use of a photograph\r\ntaken at his order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENETIAN PAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nI.

Value of Venetian Art.=--Among the Italian schools of painting the\r\nVenetian has, for the majority of art-loving people, the strongest and\r\nmost enduring attraction. In the course of the present brief account of\r\nthe life of that school we shall perhaps discover some of the causes of\r\nour peculiar delight and interest in the Venetian painters, as we come\r\nto realise what tendencies of the human spirit their art embodied, and\r\nof what great consequence their example has been to the whole of\r\nEuropean painting for the last three centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians as a school were from the first endowed with exquisite\r\ntact in their use of colour. Seldom cold and rarely too warm, their\r\ncolouring never seems an afterthought, as in many of the Florentine\r\npainters, nor is it always suggesting paint, as in some of the Veronese\r\nmasters. When the eye has grown accustomed to make allowance for the\r\ndarkening caused by time, for the dirt that lies in layers on so many\r\npictures, and for unsuccessful attempts at restoration, the better\r\nVenetian paintings present such harmony of intention and execution as\r\ndistinguishes the highest achievements of genuine poets. Their mastery\r\nover colour is the first thing that attracts most people to the painters\r\nof Venice. Their colouring not only gives direct pleasure to the eye,\r\nbut acts like music upon the moods, stimulating thought and memory in\r\nmuch the same way as a work by a great composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=II. The Church and Painting.=--The Church from the first took account of\r\nthe influence of colour as well as of music upon the emotions. From the\r\nearliest times it employed mosaic and painting to enforce its dogmas and\r\nrelate its legends, not merely because this was the only means of\r\nreaching people who could neither read nor write, but also because it\r\ninstructed them in a way which, far from leading to critical enquiry,\r\nwas peculiarly capable of being used as an indirect stimulus to moods of\r\ndevotion and contrition. Next to the finest mosaics of the first\r\ncenturies, the early works of Giovanni Bellini, the greatest Venetian\r\nmaster of the fifteenth century, best fulfil this religious intention.\r\nPainting had in his lifetime reached a point where the difficulties of\r\ntechnique no longer stood in the way of the expression of profound\r\nemotion. No one can look at Bellini's pictures of the Dead Christ upheld\r\nby the Virgin or angels without being put into a mood of deep\r\ncontrition, nor at his earlier Madonnas without a thrill of awe and\r\nreverence. And Giovanni Bellini does not stand alone. His\r\ncontemporaries, Gentile Bellini, the Vivarini, Crivelli, and Cima da\r\nConegliano all began by painting in the same spirit, and produced almost\r\nthe same effect.\r\n\r\nThe Church, however, thus having educated people to understand painting\r\nas a language and to look to it for the expression of their sincerest\r\nfeelings, could not hope to keep it always confined to the channel of\r\nreligious emotion. People began to feel the need of painting as\r\nsomething that entered into their every-day lives almost as much as we\r\nnowadays feel the need of the newspaper; nor was this unnatural,\r\nconsidering that, until the invention of printing, painting was the only\r\nway, apart from direct speech, of conveying ideas to the masses. At\r\nabout the time when Bellini and his contemporaries were attaining\r\nmaturity, the Renaissance had ceased to be a movement carried on by\r\nscholars and poets alone. It had become sufficiently widespread to seek\r\npopular as well as literary utterance, and thus, toward the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, it naturally turned to painting, a vehicle of\r\nexpression which the Church, after a thousand years of use, had made\r\nfamiliar and beloved.\r\n\r\nTo understand the Renaissance at the time when its spirit began to find\r\ncomplete embodiment in painting, a brief survey of the movement of\r\nthought in Italy during its earlier period is necessary, because only\r\nwhen that movement had reached a certain point did painting come to be\r\nits most natural medium of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n=III. The Renaissance.=--The thousand years that elapsed between the\r\ntriumph of Christianity and the middle of the fourteenth century have\r\nbeen not inaptly compared to the first fifteen or sixteen years in the\r\nlife of the individual. Whether full of sorrows or joys, of storms or\r\npeace, these early years are chiefly characterised by tutelage and\r\nunconsciousness of personality. But toward the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury something happened in Europe that happens in the lives of all\r\ngifted individuals. There was an awakening to the sense of personality.\r\nAlthough it was felt to a greater or less degree everywhere, Italy felt\r\nthe awakening earlier than the rest of Europe, and felt it far more\r\nstrongly. Its first manifestation was a boundless and insatiable\r\ncuriosity, urging people to find out all they could about the world and\r\nabout man. They turned eagerly to the study of classic literature and\r\nancient monuments, because these gave the key to what seemed an immense\r\nstore-house of forgotten knowledge; they were in fact led to antiquity\r\nby the same impulse which, a little later, brought about the invention\r\nof the printing-press and the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nThe first consequence of a return to classical literature was the\r\nworship of human greatness. Roman literature, which the Italians\r\nnaturally mastered much earlier than Greek, dealt chiefly with politics\r\nand war, seeming to give an altogether disproportionate place to the\r\nindividual, because it treated only of such individuals as were\r\nconcerned in great events. It is but a step from realising the greatness\r\nof an event to believing that the persons concerned in it were equally\r\ngreat, and this belief, fostered by the somewhat rhetorical literature\r\nof Rome, met the new consciousness of personality more than half way,\r\nand led to that unlimited admiration for human genius and achievement\r\nwhich was so prominent a feature of the early Renaissance. The two\r\ntendencies reacted upon each other. Roman literature stimulated the\r\nadmiration for genius, and this admiration in turn reinforced the\r\ninterest in that period of the world's history when genius was supposed\r\nto be the rule rather than the exception; that is to say, it reinforced\r\nthe interest in antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of discovery, the never satisfied curiosity of this time, led\r\nto the study of ancient art as well as of ancient literature, and the\r\nlove of antiquity led to the imitation of its buildings and statues as\r\nwell as of its books and poems. Until comparatively recent times\r\nscarcely any ancient paintings were found, although buildings and\r\nstatues were everywhere to be seen, the moment anyone seriously thought\r\nof looking at them. The result was that while the architecture and\r\nsculpture of the Renaissance were directly and strongly influenced by\r\nantiquity, painting felt its influence only in so far as the study of\r\nantiquity in the other arts had conduced to better draughtsmanship and\r\npurer taste. The spirit of discovery could thus show itself only\r\nindirectly in painting,--only in so far as it led painters to the\r\ngradual perfection of the technical means of their craft.\r\n\r\nUnlimited admiration for genius and wonder that the personalities of\r\nantiquity should have survived with their great names in no way\r\ndiminished, soon had two consequences. One was love of glory, and the\r\nother the patronage of those arts which were supposed to hand down a\r\nglorious name undiminished to posterity. The glory of old Rome had come\r\ndown through poets and historians, architects and sculptors, and the\r\nItalians, feeling that the same means might be used to hand down the\r\nachievements of their own time to as distant a posterity, made a new\r\nreligion of glory, with poets and artists for the priests. At first the\r\nnew priesthood was confined almost entirely to writers, but in little\r\nmore than a generation architects and sculptors began to have their\r\npart. The passion for building is in itself one of the most instinctive,\r\nand a man's name and armorial bearings, tastefully but prominently\r\ndisplayed upon a church or palace, were as likely, it was felt, to hand\r\nhim down to posterity as the praise of poets or historians. It was the\r\npassion for glory, in reality, rather than any love of beauty, that gave\r\nthe first impulse to the patronage of the arts in the Renaissance.\r\nBeauty was the concern of the artists, although no doubt their patrons\r\nwere well aware that the more impressive a building was, the more\r\nbeautiful a monument, the more likely was it to be admired, and the\r\nmore likely were their names to reach posterity. Their instincts did not\r\nmislead them, for where their real achievements would have tempted only\r\nthe specialist or antiquarian into a study of their career, the\r\nbuildings and monuments put up by them--by such princes as Sigismondo\r\nMalatesta, Frederick of Urbino, or Alfonzo of Naples,--have made the\r\nwhole intelligent public believe that they were really as great as they\r\nwished posterity to believe them.\r\n\r\nAs painting had done nothing whatever to transmit the glory of the great\r\nRomans, the earlier generations of the Renaissance expected nothing from\r\nit, and did not give it that patronage which the Church, for its own\r\npurposes, continued to hold out to it. The Renaissance began to make\r\nespecial use of painting only when its own spirit had spread very\r\nwidely, and when the love of knowledge, of power, and of glory had\r\nceased to be the only recognised passions, and when, following the lead\r\nof the Church, people began to turn to painting for the expression of\r\ndeep emotion. The new religion, as I have called the love of glory, is\r\nin its very essence a thing of this world, founded as it is on human\r\nesteem. The boundless curiosity of the Renaissance led back inevitably\r\nto an interest in life and to an acceptance of things for what they\r\nwere,--for their intrinsic quality. The moment people stopped looking\r\nfixedly toward heaven their eyes fell upon the earth, and they began to\r\nsee much on its surface that was pleasant. Their own faces and figures\r\nmust have struck them as surprisingly interesting, and, considering how\r\nlittle St. Bernard and other mediæval saints and doctors had led them to\r\nexpect, singularly beautiful. A new feeling arose that mere living was a\r\nbig part of life, and with it came a new passion, the passion for\r\nbeauty, for grace, and for comeliness.\r\n\r\nIt has already been suggested that the Renaissance was a period in the\r\nhistory of modern Europe comparable to youth in the life of the\r\nindividual. It had all youth's love of finery and of play. The more\r\npeople were imbued with the new spirit, the more they loved pageants.\r\nThe pageant was an outlet for many of the dominant passions of the\r\ntime, for there a man could display all the finery he pleased, satisfy\r\nhis love of antiquity by masquerading as Cæsar or Hannibal, his love of\r\nknowledge by finding out how the Romans dressed and rode in triumph, his\r\nlove of glory by the display of wealth and skill in the management of\r\nthe ceremony, and, above all, his love of feeling himself alive. Solemn\r\nwriters have not disdained to describe to the minutest details many of\r\nthe pageants which they witnessed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the earlier elements of the Renaissance, the passion\r\nfor knowledge and glory, were not of the kind to give a new impulse to\r\npainting. Nor was the passion for antiquity at all so direct an\r\ninspiration to that art as it was to architecture and sculpture. The\r\nlove of glory had, it is true, led such as could not afford to put up\r\nmonumental buildings, to decorate chapels with frescoes in which their\r\nportraits were timidly introduced. But it was only when the Renaissance\r\nhad attained to a full consciousness of its interest in life and\r\nenjoyment of the world that it naturally turned, and indeed was forced\r\nto turn, to painting; for it is obvious that painting is peculiarly\r\nfitted for rendering the appearances of things with a glow of light and\r\nrichness of colour that correspond to and express warm human emotions.\r\n\r\n=IV. Painting and the Renaissance.=--When it once reached the point\r\nwhere its view of the world naturally sought expression in painting, as\r\nreligious ideas had done before, the Renaissance found in Venice clearer\r\nutterance than elsewhere, and it is perhaps this fact which makes the\r\nmost abiding interest of Venetian painting. It is at this point that we\r\nshall take it up.\r\n\r\nThe growing delight in life with the consequent love of health, beauty,\r\nand joy were felt more powerfully in Venice than anywhere else in Italy.\r\nThe explanation of this may be found in the character of the Venetian\r\ngovernment which was such that it gave little room for the satisfaction\r\nof the passion for personal glory, and kept its citizens so busy in\r\nduties of state that they had small leisure for learning. Some of the\r\nchief passions of the Renaissance thus finding no outlet in Venice, the\r\nother passions insisted all the more on being satisfied. Venice,\r\nmoreover, was the only state in Italy which was enjoying, and for many\r\ngenerations had been enjoying, internal peace. This gave the Venetians a\r\nlove of comfort, of ease, and of splendour, a refinement of manner, and\r\nhumaneness of feeling, which made them the first really modern people in\r\nEurope. Since there was little room for personal glory in Venice, the\r\nperpetuators of glory, the Humanists, found at first scant encouragement\r\nthere, and the Venetians were saved from that absorption in archæology\r\nand pure science which overwhelmed Florence at an early date. This was\r\nnot necessarily an advantage in itself, but it happened to suit Venice,\r\nwhere the conditions of life had for some time been such as to build up\r\na love of beautiful things. As it was, the feeling for beauty was not\r\nhindered in its natural development. Archæology would have tried to\r\nsubmit it to the good taste of the past, a proceeding which rarely\r\npromotes good taste in the present. Too much archæology and too much\r\nscience might have ended in making Venetian art academic, instead of\r\nletting it become what it did, the product of a natural ripening of\r\ninterest in life and love of pleasure. In Florence, it is true, painting\r\nhad developed almost simultaneously with the other arts, and it may be\r\ndue to this very cause that the Florentine painters never quite realised\r\nwhat a different task from the architect's and sculptor's was theirs. At\r\nthe time, therefore, when the Renaissance was beginning to find its best\r\nexpression in painting, the Florentines were already too much attached\r\nto classical ideals of form and composition, in other words, too\r\nacademic, to give embodiment to the throbbing feeling for life and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that in the Venetian pictures of the end of the\r\nfifteenth century we find neither the contrition nor the devotion of\r\nthose earlier years when the Church alone employed painting as the\r\ninterpreter of emotion, nor the learning which characterised the\r\nFlorentines. The Venetian masters of this time, although nominally\r\ncontinuing to paint the Madonna and saints, were in reality painting\r\nhandsome, healthy, sane people like themselves, people who wore their\r\nsplendid robes with dignity, who found life worth the mere living and\r\nsought no metaphysical basis for it. In short, the Venetian pictures of\r\nthe last decade of the century seemed intended not for devotion, as they\r\nhad been, nor for admiration, as they then were in Florence, but for\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe Church itself, as has been said, had educated its children to\r\nunderstand painting as a language. Now that the passions men dared to\r\navow were no longer connected with happiness in some future state only,\r\nbut mainly with life in the present, painting was expected to give voice\r\nto these more human aspirations and to desert the outgrown ideals of the\r\nChurch. In Florence, the painters seemed unable or unwilling to make\r\ntheir art really popular. Nor was it so necessary there, for Poliziano,\r\nPulci, and Lorenzo dei Medici supplied the need of self-expression by\r\naddressing the Florentines in the language which their early enthusiasm\r\nfor antiquity and their natural gifts had made them understand better\r\nthan any other--the language of poetry. In Venice alone painting\r\nremained what it had been all over Italy in earlier times, the common\r\ntongue of the whole mass of the people. Venetian artists thus had the\r\nstrongest inducements to perfect the processes which painters must\r\nemploy to make pictures look real to their own generation; and their\r\ngeneration had an altogether firmer hold on reality than any that had\r\nbeen known since the triumph of Christianity. Here again the comparison\r\nof the Renaissance to youth must be borne in mind. The grasp that youth\r\nhas on reality is not to be compared to that brought by age, and we must\r\nnot expect to find in the Renaissance a passion for an acquaintance with\r\nthings as they are such as we ourselves have; but still its grasp of\r\nfacts was far firmer than that of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nPainting, in accommodating itself to the new ideas, found that it could\r\nnot attain to satisfactory representation merely by form and colour, but\r\nthat it required light and shadow and effects of space. Indeed, venial\r\nfaults of drawing are perhaps the least disturbing, while faults of\r\nperspective, of spacing, and of colour completely spoil a picture for\r\npeople who have an every-day acquaintance with painting such as the\r\nVenetians had. We find the Venetian painters, therefore, more and more\r\nintent upon giving the space they paint its real depth, upon giving\r\nsolid objects the full effect of the round, upon keeping the different\r\nparts of a figure within the same plane, and upon compelling things to\r\nhold their proper places one behind the other. As early as the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century a few of the greater Venetian painters had\r\nsucceeded in making distant objects less and less distinct, as well as\r\nsmaller and smaller, and had succeeded also in giving some appearance of\r\nreality to the atmosphere. These are a few of the special problems of\r\npainting, as distinct from sculpture for instance, and they are problems\r\nwhich, among the Italians, only the Venetians and the painters closely\r\nconnected with them solved with any success.\r\n\r\n\r\n=V. Pageant Pictures.=--The painters of the end of the fifteenth century\r\nwho met with the greatest success in solving these problems were\r\nGiovanni and Gentile Bellini, Cima da Conegliano, and Carpaccio, and we\r\nfind each of them enjoyable to the degree that he was in touch with the\r\nlife of his day. I have already spoken of pageants and of how\r\ncharacteristic they were of the Renaissance, forming as they did a sort\r\nof safety-valve for its chief passions. Venice, too, knew the love of\r\nglory, and the passion was perhaps only the more intense because it was\r\nall dedicated to the State. There was nothing the Venetians would not do\r\nto add to its greatness, glory, and splendour. It was this which led\r\nthem to make of the city itself that wondrous monument to the love and\r\nawe they felt for their Republic, which still rouses more admiration and\r\ngives more pleasure than any other one achievement of the art-impulse in\r\nman. They were not content to make their city the most beautiful in the\r\nworld; they performed ceremonies in its honour partaking of all the\r\nsolemnity of religious rites. Processions and pageants by land and by\r\nsea, free from that gross element of improvisation which characterised\r\nthem elsewhere in Italy, formed no less a part of the functions of the\r\nVenetian State than the High Mass in the Catholic Church. Such a\r\nfunction, with Doge and Senators arrayed in gorgeous costumes no less\r\nprescribed than the raiments of ecclesiastics, in the midst of the\r\nfairy-like architecture of the Piazza or canals, was the event most\r\neagerly looked forward to, and the one that gave most satisfaction to\r\nthe Venetian's love of his State, and to his love of splendour, beauty,\r\nand gaiety. He would have had them every day if it were possible, and,\r\nto make up for their rarity, he loved to have representations of them.\r\nSo most Venetian pictures of the beginning of the sixteenth century\r\ntended to take the form of magnificent processions, if they did not\r\nactually represent them. They are processions in the Piazza, as in\r\nGentile Bellini's \"Corpus Christi\" picture, or on the water, as in\r\nCarpaccio's picture where St. Ursula leaves her home; or they represent\r\nwhat was a gorgeous but common sight in Venice, the reception or\r\ndismissal of ambassadors, as in several pictures of Carpaccio's St.\r\nUrsula series; or they show simply a collection of splendidly costumed\r\npeople in the Piazza, as in Gentile's \"Preaching of St. Mark.\" Not only\r\nthe pleasure-loving Carpaccio, but the austere Cima, as he grew older,\r\nturned every biblical and saintly legend into an occasion for the\r\npicture of a pageant.\r\n\r\nBut there was a further reason for the popularity of such pictures. The\r\ndecorations which were then being executed by the most reputed masters\r\nin the Hall of Great Council in the Doge's Palace, were, by the nature\r\nof the subject, required to represent pageants. The Venetian State\r\nencouraged painting as did the Church, in order to teach its subjects\r\nits own glory in a way that they could understand without being led on\r\nto critical enquiry. Venice was not the only city, it is true, that used\r\npainting for political purposes; but the frescoes of Lorenzetti at Siena\r\nwere admonitions to govern in accordance with the Catechism, while the\r\npictures in the Great Hall of the Doge's Palace were of a nature to\r\nremind the Venetians of their glory and also of their state policy.\r\nThese mural paintings represented such subjects as the Doge bringing\r\nabout a reconciliation between the Pope and the Emperor Barbarossa, an\r\nevent which marked the first entry of Venice into the field of\r\nContinental politics, and typified as well its unchanging policy, which\r\nwas to gain its own ends by keeping a balance of power between the\r\nallies of the Pope and the allies of his opponents. The first edition,\r\nso to speak, of these works had been executed at the end of the\r\nfourteenth century and in the beginning of the fifteenth. Toward the end\r\nof that century it no longer satisfied the new feeling for reality and\r\nbeauty, and thus had ceased to serve its purpose, which was to glorify\r\nthe State. The Bellini, Alvise Vivarini, and Carpaccio were employed to\r\nmake a second rendering of the very same subjects, and this gave the\r\nVenetians ample opportunity for finding out how much they liked pageant\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note here that at the same time Florence also\r\ncommissioned its greatest painters to execute works for its Council\r\nHall, but left them practically free to choose their own subjects.\r\nMichelangelo chose for his theme \"The Florentines while Bathing\r\nSurprised by the Pisans,\" and Leonardo \"The Battle of the Standard.\"\r\nNeither of these was intended in the first place to glorify the\r\nFlorentine Republic, but rather to give scope to the painter's genius,\r\nMichelangelo's for the treatment of the nude, Leonardo's for movement\r\nand animation. Each, having given scope to his peculiar talents in his\r\ncartoon, had no further interest, and neither of the undertakings was\r\never completed. Nor do we hear that the Florentine councillors enjoyed\r\nthe cartoons, which were instantly snatched up by students who turned\r\nthe hall containing them into an academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VI. Painting and the Confraternities.=--It does not appear that the Hall\r\nof Great Council in Venice was turned into a students' academy, and,\r\nalthough the paintings there doubtless gave a decided incentive to\r\nartists, their effect upon the public, for whom they were designed, was\r\neven greater. The councillors were not allowed to be the only people to\r\nenjoy fascinating pictures of gorgeous pageants and ceremonials. The\r\nMutual Aid Societies--the Schools, as they were called--were not long in\r\ngetting the masters who were employed in the Doge's Palace to execute\r\nfor their own meeting places pictures equally splendid. The Schools of\r\nSan Giorgio, Sant' Ursula, and Santo Stefano, employed Carpaccio, the\r\nSchools of San Giovanni and San Marco, Gentile Bellini, and other\r\nSchools employed minor painters. The works carried out for these Schools\r\nare of peculiar importance, both because they are all that remain to\r\nthrow light upon the pictures in the Doge's Palace destroyed in the fire\r\nof 1576, and because they form a transition to the art of a later day.\r\nJust as the State chose subjects that glorified itself and taught its\r\nown history and policy, so the Schools had pictures painted to glorify\r\ntheir patron saints, and to keep their deeds and example fresh. Many of\r\nthese pictures--most in fact--took the form of pageants; but even in\r\nsuch, intended as they were for almost domestic purposes, the style of\r\nhigh ceremonial was relaxed, and elements taken directly from life were\r\nintroduced. In his \"Corpus Christi,\" Gentile Bellini paints not only the\r\nsolemn and dazzling procession in the Piazza, but the elegant young men\r\nwho strut about in all their finery, the foreign loungers, and even the\r\nunfailing beggar by the portal of St. Mark's. In his \"Miracle of the\r\nTrue Cross,\" he introduces gondoliers, taking care to bring out all the\r\nbeauty of their lithe, comely figures as they stand to ply the oar, and\r\ndoes not reject even such an episode as a serving-maid standing in a\r\ndoorway watching a negro who is about to plunge into the canal. He\r\ntreats this bit of the picture with all the charm and much of that\r\ndelicate feeling for simple effects of light and colour that we find in\r\nsuch Dutch painters as Vermeer van Delft and Peter de Hoogh.\r\n\r\nEpisodes such as this in the works of the earliest great Venetian master\r\nmust have acted on the public like a spark on tinder. They certainly\r\nfound a sudden and assured popularity, for they play a more and more\r\nimportant part in the pictures executed for the Schools, many of the\r\nsubjects of which were readily turned into studies of ordinary Venetian\r\nlife. This was particularly true of the works of Carpaccio. Much as he\r\nloved pageants, he loved homelier scenes as well. His \"Dream of St.\r\nUrsula\" shows us a young girl asleep in a room filled with the quiet\r\nmorning light. Indeed, it may be better described as the picture of a\r\nroom with the light playing softly upon its walls, upon the flower-pots\r\nin the window, and upon the writing-table and the cupboards. A young\r\ngirl happens to be asleep in the bed, but the picture is far from being\r\na merely economic illustration to this episode in the life of the saint.\r\nAgain, let us take the work in the same series where King Maure\r\ndismisses the ambassadors. Carpaccio has made this a scene of a\r\nchancellery in which the most striking features are neither the king nor\r\nthe ambassadors, but the effect of the light that streams through a side\r\ndoor on the left and a poor clerk labouring at his task. Or, again, take\r\nSt. Jerome in his study, in the Scuola di San Giorgio. He is nothing but\r\na Venetian scholar seated in his comfortable, bright library, in the\r\nmidst of his books, with his little shelf of bric-à-brac running along\r\nthe wall. There is nothing in his look or surroundings to speak of a\r\nlife of self-denial or of arduous devotion to the problems of sin and\r\nredemption. Even the \"Presentation of the Virgin,\" which offered such a\r\nsplendid chance for a pageant, Carpaccio, in one instance, turned into\r\nthe picture of a simple girl going to her first communion. In other\r\nwords, Carpaccio's quality is the quality of a painter of _genre_, of\r\nwhich he was the earliest Italian master. His _genre_ differs from Dutch\r\nor French not in kind but in degree. Dutch _genre_ is much more\r\ndemocratic, and, as painting, it is of a far finer quality, but it deals\r\nwith its subject, as Carpaccio does, for the sake of its own pictorial\r\ncapacities and for the sake of the effects of colour and of light and\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VII. Easel Pictures and Giorgione.=--At the beginning of the Renaissance\r\npainting was almost wholly confined to the Church. From the Church it\r\nextended to the Council Hall, and thence to the Schools. There it\r\nrapidly developed into an art which had no higher aim than painting the\r\nsumptuous life of the aristocracy. When it had reached this point, there\r\nwas no reason whatever why it should not begin to grace the dwellings of\r\nall well-to-do people.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century painting was not looked upon with the\r\nestranging reverence paid to it now. It was almost as cheap as printing\r\nhas become since, and almost as much employed. When the Venetians had\r\nattained the point of culture where they were able to differentiate\r\ntheir sensations and distinguish pleasure from edification, they found\r\nthat painting gave them decided pleasure. Why should they always have to\r\ngo to the Doge's Palace or to some School to enjoy this pleasure? That\r\nwould have been no less a hardship than for us never to hear music\r\noutside of a concert-room. This is no merely rhetorical comparison, for\r\nin the life of the Venetian of the sixteenth century painting took much\r\nthe same place that music takes in ours. He no longer expected it to\r\ntell him stories or to teach him the Catechism. Printed books, which\r\nwere beginning to grow common, amply satisfied both these needs. He had\r\nas a rule very little personal religion, and consequently did not care\r\nfor pictures that moved him to contrition or devotion. He preferred to\r\nhave some pleasantly coloured thing that would put him into a mood\r\nconnected with the side of life he most enjoyed--with refined\r\nmerrymaking, with country parties, or with the sweet dreams of youth.\r\nVenetian painting alone among Italian schools was ready to satisfy such\r\na demand, and it thus became the first genuinely modern art: for the\r\nmost vital difference that can be indicated between the arts in\r\nantiquity and modern times is this--that now the arts tend to address\r\nthemselves more and more to the actual needs of men, while in olden\r\ntimes they were supposed to serve some more than human purpose.\r\n\r\nThe pictures required for a house were naturally of a different kind\r\nfrom those suited to the Council Hall or the School, where large\r\npaintings, which could be filled with many figures, were in place. For\r\nthe house smaller pictures were necessary, such as could easily be\r\ncarried about. The mere dimensions, therefore, excluded pageants, but,\r\nin any case, the pageant was too formal a subject to suit all moods--too\r\nmuch like a brass band always playing in the room. The easel picture had\r\nto be without too definite a subject, and could no more permit being\r\ntranslated into words than a sonata. Some of Giovanni Bellini's late\r\nworks are already of this kind. They are full of that subtle, refined\r\npoetry which can be expressed in form and colour alone. But they were a\r\nlittle too austere in form, a little too sober in colour, for the gay,\r\ncare-free youth of the time. Carpaccio does not seem to have painted\r\nmany easel pictures, although his brilliancy, his delightful fancy, his\r\nlove of colour, and his gaiety of humour would have fitted him admirably\r\nfor this kind of painting. But Giorgione, the follower of both these\r\nmasters, starting with the qualities of both as his inheritance,\r\ncombined the refined feeling and poetry of Bellini with Carpaccio's\r\ngaiety and love of beauty and colour. Stirred with the enthusiasms of\r\nhis own generation as people who had lived through other phases of\r\nfeeling could not be, Giorgione painted pictures so perfectly in touch\r\nwith the ripened spirit of the Renaissance that they met with the\r\nsuccess which those things only find that at the same moment wake us to\r\nthe full sense of a need and satisfy it.\r\n\r\nGiorgione's life was short, and very few of his works--not a score in\r\nall--have escaped destruction. But these suffice to give us a glimpse\r\ninto that brief moment when the Renaissance found its most genuine\r\nexpression in painting. Its over-boisterous passions had quieted down\r\ninto a sincere appreciation of beauty and of human relations. It would\r\nbe really hard to say more about Giorgione than this, that his pictures\r\nare the perfect reflex of the Renaissance at its height. His works, as\r\nwell as those of his contemporaries and followers, still continue to be\r\nappreciated most by people whose attitude of mind and spirit has most in\r\ncommon with the Renaissance, or by those who look upon Italian art not\r\nmerely as art, but as the product of this period. For that is its\r\ngreatest interest. Other schools have accomplished much more in mere\r\npainting than the Italian. A serious student of art will scarcely think\r\nof putting many of even the highest achievements of the Italians,\r\nconsidered purely as technique, beside the works of the great Dutchmen,\r\nthe great Spaniard, or even the masters of to-day. Our real interest in\r\nItalian painting is at bottom an interest in that art which we almost\r\ninstinctively feel to have been the fittest expression found by a period\r\nin the history of modern Europe which has much in common with youth.\r\nThe Renaissance has the fascination of those years when we seemed so\r\nfull of promise both to ourselves and to everybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VIII. The Giorgionesque Spirit.=--Giorgione created a demand which other\r\npainters were forced to supply at the risk of finding no favour. The\r\nolder painters accommodated themselves as best they could. One of them\r\nindeed, turning toward the new in a way that is full of singular charm,\r\ngave his later works all the beauty and softness of the first spring\r\ndays in Italy. Upon hearing the title of one of Catena's works in the\r\nNational Gallery, \"A Warrior Adoring the Infant Christ,\" who could\r\nimagine what a treat the picture itself had in store for him? It is a\r\nfragrant summer landscape enjoyed by a few quiet people, one of whom, in\r\narmour, with the glamour of the Orient about him, kneels at the Virgin's\r\nfeet, while a romantic young page holds his horse's bridle. I mention\r\nthis picture in particular because it is so accessible, and so good an\r\ninstance of the Giorgionesque way of treating a subject; not for the\r\nstory, nor for the display of skill, nor for the obvious feeling, but\r\nfor the lovely landscape, for the effects of light and colour, and for\r\nthe sweetness of human relations. Giorgione's altar-piece at\r\nCastelfranco is treated in precisely the same spirit, but with far more\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe young painters had no chance at all unless they undertook at once to\r\nfurnish pictures in Giorgione's style. But before we can appreciate all\r\nthat the younger men were called upon to do, we must turn to the\r\nconsideration of that most wonderful product of the Renaissance and of\r\nthe painter's craft--the Portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\n=IX. The Portrait.=--The longing for the perpetuation of one's fame, which\r\nhas already been mentioned several times as one of the chief passions of\r\nthe Renaissance, brought with it the more universal desire to hand down\r\nthe memory of one's face and figure. The surest way to accomplish this\r\nend seemed to be the one which had proved successful in the case of the\r\ngreat Romans, whose effigies were growing more and more familiar as new\r\nbusts and medals were dug up. The earlier generations of the\r\nRenaissance relied therefore on the sculptor and the medallist to hand\r\ndown their features to an interested posterity. These artists were ready\r\nfor their task. The mere materials gave them solidity, an effect so hard\r\nto get in painting. At the same time, nothing was expected from them\r\nexcept that they should mould the material into the desired shape. No\r\nsetting was required and no colour. Their art on this account alone\r\nwould naturally have been the earliest to reach fruition. But over and\r\nabove this, sculptors and medallists had the direct inspiration of\r\nantique models, and through the study of these they were at an early\r\ndate brought in contact with the tendencies of the Renaissance. The\r\npassion then prevailing for pronounced types, and the spirit of analysis\r\nthis produced, forced them to such patient study of the face as would\r\nenable them to give the features that look of belonging to one\r\nconsistent whole which we call character. Thus, at a time when painters\r\nhad not yet learned to distinguish between one face and another,\r\nDonatello was carving busts which remain unrivalled as studies of\r\ncharacter, and Pisanello was casting bronze and silver medals which are\r\namong the greatest claims to renown of those whose effigies they bear.\r\n\r\nDonatello's bust of Niccolò d'Uzzano shows clearly, nevertheless, that\r\nthe Renaissance could not long remain satisfied with the sculptured\r\nportrait. It is coloured like nature, and succeeds so well in producing\r\nfor an instant the effect of actual life as to seem uncanny the next\r\nmoment. Donatello's contemporaries must have had the same impression,\r\nfor busts of this kind are but few. Yet these few prove that the element\r\nof colour had to be included before the satisfactory portrait was found:\r\nin other words, that painting and not sculpture was to be the\r\nportrait-art of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe most creative sculptor of the earlier Renaissance was not the only\r\nartist who felt the need of colour in portraiture. Vittore Pisano, the\r\ngreatest medallist of this or any age, felt it quite as keenly, and\r\nbeing a painter as well, he was among the first to turn this art to\r\nportraiture. In his day, however, painting was still too undeveloped an\r\nart for the portrait not to lose in character what it gained in a more\r\nlifelike colouring, and the two of Pisanello's portraits which still\r\nexist are profiles much inferior to his best medals, seeming indeed to\r\nbe enlargements of them rather than original studies from life.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the next generation, when the attention of painters\r\nthemselves was powerfully concentrated upon the reproduction of strongly\r\npronounced types of humanity, that they began to make portraits as full\r\nof life and energy as Donatello's busts of the previous period. Even\r\nthen, however, the full face was rarely attempted, and it was only in\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century that full-face portraits began to\r\nbe common. The earliest striking achievement of this sort, Mantegna's\r\nhead of Cardinal Scarampo (now in Berlin), was not the kind to find\r\nfavour in Venice. The full-face likeness of this wolf in sheep's\r\nclothing brought out the workings of the self-seeking, cynical spirit\r\nwithin too clearly not to have revolted the Venetians, who looked upon\r\nall such qualities as impious in the individual because they were the\r\nstrict monopoly of the State. In the portraits of Doges which decorated\r\nthe frieze of its great Council Hall, Venice wanted the effigies of\r\nfunctionaries entirely devoted to the State, and not of great\r\npersonalities, and the profile lent itself more readily to the omission\r\nof purely individual traits.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that Venice was the first state which made a business\r\nof preserving the portraits of its chief rulers. Those which Gentile and\r\nGiovanni Bellini executed for this end must have had no less influence\r\non portraiture than their mural paintings in the same Hall had on other\r\nbranches of the art. But the State was not satisfied with leaving\r\nrecords of its glory in the Ducal Palace alone. The Church and the\r\nsaints were impressed for the same purpose--happily for us, for while\r\nthe portraits in the Great Hall have perished, several altar-pieces\r\nstill preserve to us the likenesses of some of the Doges.\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century, when people began to want pictures in\r\ntheir own homes as well as in their public halls, personal and\r\nreligious motives combined to dictate the choice of subjects. In the\r\nminds of many, painting, although a very familiar art, was too much\r\nconnected with solemn religious rites and with state ceremonies to be\r\nused at once for ends of personal pleasure. So landscape had to slide in\r\nunder the patronage of St. Jerome; while romantic biblical episodes,\r\nlike the \"Finding of Moses,\" or the \"Judgment of Solomon,\" gave an\r\nexcuse for _genre_, and the portrait crept in half hidden under the\r\nmantle of a patron saint. Its position once secure, however, the\r\nportrait took no time to cast off all tutelage, and to declare itself\r\none of the most attractive subjects possible. Over and above the obvious\r\nsatisfaction afforded by a likeness, the portrait had to give pleasure\r\nto the eye, and to produce those agreeable moods which were expected\r\nfrom all other paintings in Giorgione's time. Portraits like that of\r\nScarampo are scarcely less hard to live with than such a person himself\r\nmust have been. They tyrannize rather than soothe and please. But\r\nGiorgione and his immediate followers painted men and women whose very\r\nlook leads one to think of sympathetic friends, people whose features\r\nare pleasantly rounded, whose raiment seems soft to touch, whose\r\nsurroundings call up the memory of sweet landscapes and refreshing\r\nbreezes. In fact, in these portraits the least apparent object was the\r\nlikeness, the real purpose being to please the eye and to turn the mind\r\ntoward pleasant themes. This no doubt helps to account for the great\r\npopularity of portraits in Venice during the sixteenth century. Their\r\nnumber, as we shall see, only grows larger as the century advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n=X. The Young Titian.=--Giorgione's followers had only to exploit the vein\r\ntheir master hit upon to find ample remuneration. Each, to be sure,\r\nbrought a distinct personality into play, but the demand for the\r\nGiorgionesque article, if I may be allowed the phrase, was too strong to\r\npermit of much deviation. It no longer mattered what the picture was to\r\nrepresent or where it was going to be placed; the treatment had to be\r\nalways bright, romantic, and joyous. Many artists still confined\r\nthemselves to painting ecclesiastical subjects chiefly, but even among\r\nthese, such painters as Lotto and Palma, for example, are fully as\r\nGiorgionesque as Titian, Bonifazio, or Paris Bordone.\r\n\r\nTitian, in spite of a sturdier, less refined nature, did nothing for a\r\ngeneration after Giorgione's death but work on his lines. A difference\r\nin quality between the two masters shows itself from the first, but the\r\nspirit that animated each is identical. The pictures Titian was painting\r\nten years after his companion's death have not only many of the\r\nqualities of Giorgione's, but something more, as if done by an older\r\nGiorgione, with better possession of himself, and with a larger and\r\nfirmer hold on the world. At the same time, they show no diminution of\r\nspontaneous joy in life, and even an increased sense of its value and\r\ndignity. What an array of masterpieces might be brought to witness! In\r\nthe \"Assumption,\" for example, the Virgin soars heavenward, not helpless\r\nin the arms of angels, but borne up by the fulness of life within her,\r\nand by the feeling that the universe is naturally her own, and that\r\nnothing can check her course. The angels seem to be there only to sing\r\nthe victory of a human being over his environment. They are embodied\r\njoys, acting on our nerves like the rapturous outburst of the orchestra\r\nat the end of \"Parsifal.\" Or look at the \"Bacchanals\" in Madrid, or at\r\nthe \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" in the National Gallery. How brimful they are\r\nof exuberant joy! you see no sign of a struggle of inner and outer\r\nconditions, but life so free, so strong, so glowing, that it almost\r\nintoxicates. They are truly Dionysiac, Bacchanalian triumphs--the\r\ntriumph of life over the ghosts that love the gloom and chill and hate\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe portraits Titian painted in these years show no less feeling of\r\nfreedom from sordid cares, and no less mastery over life. Think of \"The\r\nMan with the Glove\" in the Louvre, of the \"Concert,\" and \"Young\r\nEnglishman\" in Florence, and of the Pesaro family in their altar-piece\r\nin the Frari at Venice--call up these portraits, and you will see that\r\nthey are true children of the Renaissance whom life has taught no\r\nmeannesses and no fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XI. Apparent Failure of the Renaissance.=--But even while such pictures\r\nwere being painted, the spirit of the Italian Renaissance was proving\r\ninadequate to life. This was not the fault of the spirit, which was the\r\nspirit of youth. But youth cannot last more than a certain length of\r\ntime. No matter how it is spent, manhood and middle age will come. Life\r\nbegan to show a sterner and more sober face than for a brief moment it\r\nhad seemed to wear. Men became conscious that the passions for\r\nknowledge, for glory, and for personal advancement were not at the\r\nbottom of all the problems that life presented. Florence and Rome\r\ndiscovered this suddenly, and with a shock. In the presence of\r\nMichelangelo's sculptures in San Lorenzo, or of his \"Last Judgment,\" we\r\nstill hear the cry of anguish that went up as the inexorable truth\r\ndawned upon them. But Venice, although humiliated by the League of\r\nCambrai, impoverished by the Turk, and by the change in the routes of\r\ncommerce, was not crushed, as was the rest of Italy, under the heels of\r\nSpanish infantry, nor so drained of resource as not to have some wealth\r\nstill flowing into her coffers. Life grew soberer and sterner, but it\r\nwas still amply worth the living, although the relish of a little\r\nstoicism and of earnest thought no longer seemed out of place. The\r\nspirit of the Renaissance had found its way to Venice slowly; it was\r\neven more slow to depart.\r\n\r\nWe therefore find that toward the middle of the sixteenth century, when\r\nelsewhere in Italy painting was trying to adapt itself to the hypocrisy\r\nof a Church whose chief reason for surviving as an institution was that\r\nit helped Spain to subject the world to tyranny, and when portraits were\r\nalready exhibiting the fascinating youths of an earlier generation\r\nturned into obsequious and elegant courtiers,--in Venice painting kept\r\ntrue to the ripened and more reflective spirit which succeeded to the\r\nmost glowing decades of the Renaissance. This led men to take themselves\r\nmore seriously, to act with more consideration of consequences, and to\r\nthink of life with less hope and exultation. Quieter joys were sought,\r\nthe pleasures of friendship and of the affections. Life not having\r\nproved the endless holiday it had promised to be, earnest people began\r\nto question whether under the gross masque of the official religion\r\nthere was not something to console them for departed youth and for the\r\nfailure of hopes. Thus religion began to revive in Italy, this time not\r\nethnic nor political, but personal,--an answer to the real needs of the\r\nhuman soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XII. Lotto.=--It is scarcely to be wondered at that the Venetian artist\r\nin whom we first find the expression of the new feelings, should have\r\nbeen one who by wide travel had been brought in contact with the\r\nmiseries of Italy in a way not possible for those who remained sheltered\r\nin Venice. Lorenzo Lotto, when he is most himself, does not paint the\r\ntriumph of man over his environment, but in his altar-pieces, and even\r\nmore in his portraits, he shows us people in want of the consolations of\r\nreligion, of sober thought, of friendship and affection. They look out\r\nfrom his canvases as if begging for sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut real expression for the new order of things was not to be found by\r\none like Lotto, sensitive of feeling and born in the heyday of the\r\nRenaissance, to whom the new must have come as a disappointment. It had\r\nto come from one who had not been brought in personal contact with the\r\nwoes of the rest of Italy, from one less conscious of his environment,\r\none like Titian who was readier to receive the patronage of the new\r\nmaster than to feel an oppression which did not touch him personally; or\r\nit had to come from one like Tintoretto, born to the new order of things\r\nand not having to outlive a disappointment before adapting himself to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XIII. The Late Renaissance and Titian.=--It is as impossible to keep\r\nuntouched by what happens to your neighbours as to have a bright sky\r\nover your own house when it is stormy everywhere else. Spain did not\r\ndirectly dominate Venice, but the new fashions of life and thought\r\ninaugurated by her nearly universal triumph could not be kept out. Her\r\nvictims, among whom the Italian scholars must be reckoned, flocked to\r\nVenice for shelter, persecuted by a rule that cherished the Inquisition.\r\nNow for the first time Venetian painters were brought in contact with\r\nmen of letters. As they were already, fortunately for themselves, too\r\nwell acquainted with the business of their own art to be taken in tow by\r\nlearning or even by poetry, the relation of the man of letters to the\r\npainter became on the whole a stimulating and at any rate a profitable\r\none, as in the instance of two of the greatest, where it took the form\r\nof a partnership for mutual advantage. It is not to our purpose to speak\r\nof Aretino's gain, but Titian would scarcely have acquired such fame in\r\nhis lifetime if that founder of modern journalism, Pietro Aretino, had\r\nnot been at his side, eager to trumpet his praises and to advise him\r\nwhom to court.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming triumph of Spain entailed still another consequence. It\r\nbrought home to all Italians, even to the Venetians, the sense of the\r\nindividual's helplessness before organized power--a sense which, as we\r\nhave seen, the early Renaissance, with its belief in the omnipotence of\r\nthe individual, totally lacked. This was not without a decided influence\r\non art. In the last three decades of his long career, Titian did not\r\npaint man as if he were as free from care and as fitted to his\r\nenvironment as a lark on an April morning. Rather did he represent man\r\nas acting on his environment and suffering from its reactions. He made\r\nthe faces and figures show clearly what life had done to them. The great\r\n\"Ecce Homo\" and the \"Crowning with Thorns\" are imbued with this feeling\r\nno less than the equestrian portrait of Charles the Fifth. In the \"Ecce\r\nHomo\" we see a man with a godlike personality, humbled by the imperial\r\nmajesty, broken by the imperial power, and utterly unable to hold out\r\nagainst them. In the \"Crowning with Thorns\" we have the same godlike\r\nbeing almost brutalised by pain and suffering. In the portrait of the\r\nEmperor we behold a man whom life has enfeebled, and who has to meet a\r\nfoe who may crush him.\r\n\r\nYet Titian became neither soured nor a pessimist. Many of his late\r\nportraits are even more energetic than those of his early maturity. He\r\nshows himself a wise man of the world. \"Do not be a grovelling\r\nsycophant,\" some of them seem to say, \"but remember that courtly manners\r\nand tempered elegance can do you no harm.\" Titian, then, was ever ready\r\nto change with the times, and on the whole the change was toward a\r\nfirmer grasp of reality, necessitating yet another advance in the\r\npainter's mastery of his craft. Titian's real greatness consists in the\r\nfact that he was as able to produce an effect of greater reality as he\r\nwas ready to appreciate the need of a firmer hold on life. In painting,\r\nas I have said, a greater effect of reality is chiefly a matter of light\r\nand shadow, to be obtained only by considering the canvas as an enclosed\r\nspace, filled with light and air, through which the objects are seen.\r\nThere is more than one way of getting this effect, but Titian attains it\r\nby the almost total suppression of outlines, by the harmonising of his\r\ncolours, and by the largeness and vigour of his brushwork. In fact, the\r\nold Titian was, in his way of painting, remarkably like some of the best\r\nFrench masters of to-day. This makes him only the more attractive,\r\nparticularly when with handling of this kind he combined the power of\r\ncreating forms of beauty such as he has given us in the \"Wisdom\" of the\r\nVenetian Royal Palace, or in the \"Shepherd and Nymph\" of Vienna. The\r\ndifference between the old Titian, author of these works, and the young\r\nTitian, painter of the \"Assumption,\" and of the \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\"\r\nis the difference between the Shakspeare of the \"Midsummer-Night's\r\nDream\" and the Shakspeare of the \"Tempest.\" Titian and Shakspeare begin\r\nand end so much in the same way by no mere accident. They were both\r\nproducts of the Renaissance, they underwent similar changes, and each\r\nwas the highest and completest expression of his own age. This is not\r\nthe place to elaborate the comparison, but I have dwelt so long on\r\nTitian, because, historically considered, he is the only painter who\r\nexpressed nearly all of the Renaissance that could find expression in\r\npainting. It is this which makes him even more interesting than\r\nTintoretto, an artist who in many ways was deeper, finer, and even more\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XIV. Humanity and the Renaissance.=--Tintoretto grew to manhood when the\r\nfruit of the Renaissance was ripe on every bough. The Renaissance had\r\nresulted in the emancipation of the individual, in making him feel that\r\nthe universe had no other purpose than his happiness. This brought an\r\nentirely new answer to the question, \"Why should I do this or that?\" It\r\nused to be, \"Because self-instituted authority commands you.\" The answer\r\nnow was, \"Because it is good for men.\" In this lies our greatest debt to\r\nthe Renaissance, that it instituted the welfare of man as the end of all\r\naction. The Renaissance did not bring this idea to practical issue, but\r\nour debt to it is endless on account of the results the idea has\r\nproduced in our own days. This alone would have made the Renaissance a\r\nperiod of peculiar interest, even if it had had no art whatever. But\r\nwhen ideas are fresh and strong, they are almost sure to find artistic\r\nembodiment, as indeed this whole epoch found in painting, and this\r\nparticular period in the works of Tintoretto.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XV. Sebastiano del Piombo.=--The emancipation of the individual had a\r\ndirect effect on the painter in freeing him from his guild. It now\r\noccurred to him that possibly he might become more proficient and have\r\ngreater success if he deserted the influences he was under by the\r\naccident of birth and residence, and placed himself in the school that\r\nseemed best adapted to foster his talents. This led to the unfortunate\r\nexperiment of Eclecticism which checked the purely organic development\r\nof the separate schools. It brought about their fusion into an art which\r\nno longer appealed to the Italian people, as did the art which sprang\r\nnaturally from the soil, but to the small class of _dilettanti_ who\r\nconsidered a knowledge of art as one of the birthrights of their social\r\nposition. Venice, however, suffered little from Eclecticism, perhaps\r\nbecause a strong sense of individuality was late in getting there, and\r\nby that time the painters were already well enough educated in their\r\ncraft to know that they had little to learn elsewhere. The one Venetian\r\nwho became an Eclectic, remained in spite of it a great painter.\r\nSebastiano del Piombo fell under the influence of Michelangelo, but\r\nwhile this influence was pernicious in most cases, the hand that had\r\nlearned to paint under Bellini, Cima, and Giorgione, never wholly lost\r\nits command of colour and tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XVI. Tintoretto.=--Tintoretto stayed at home, but he felt in his own\r\nperson a craving for something that Titian could not teach him. The\r\nVenice he was born in was not the Venice of Titian's early youth, and\r\nhis own adolescence fell in the period when Spain was rapidly making\r\nherself mistress of Italy. The haunting sense of powers almost\r\nirresistible gave a terrible fascination to Michelangelo's works, which\r\nare swayed by that sense as by a demonic presence. Tintoretto felt this\r\nfascination because he was in sympathy with the spirit which took form\r\nin colossal torsoes and limbs. To him these were not, as they were to\r\nMichelangelo's enrolled followers, merely new patterns after which to\r\nmodel the nude.\r\n\r\nBut beside this sense of overwhelming power and gigantic force,\r\nTintoretto had to an even greater degree the feeling that whatever\r\nexisted was for mankind and with reference to man. In his youth people\r\nwere once more turning to religion, and in Venice poetry was making its\r\nway more than it had previously done, not only because Venice had become\r\nthe refuge of men of letters, but also because of the diffusion of\r\nprinted books. Tintoretto took to the new feeling for religion and\r\npoetry as to his birthright. Yet whether classic fable or biblical\r\nepisode were the subject of his art, Tintoretto coloured it with his\r\nfeeling for the human life at the heart of the story. His sense of power\r\ndid not express itself in colossal nudes so much as in the immense\r\nenergy, in the glowing health of the figures he painted, and more still\r\nin his effects of light, which he rendered as if he had it in his hands\r\nto brighten or darken the heavens at will and subdue them to his own\r\nmoods.\r\n\r\nHe could not have accomplished this, we may be sure, if he had not had\r\neven greater skill than Titian in the treatment of light and shadow and\r\nof atmosphere. It was this which enabled him to give such living\r\nversions of biblical stories and saintly legends. For, granting that an\r\neffect of reality were attainable in painting without an adequate\r\ntreatment of light and atmosphere, even then, the reality would look\r\nhideous, as it does in many modern painters who attempt to paint people\r\nof to-day in their every-day dress and among their usual surroundings.\r\nIt is not \"Realism\" which makes such pictures hideous, but the want of\r\nthat toning down which the atmosphere gives to things in life, and of\r\nthat harmonising to which the light subjects all colours.\r\n\r\nIt was a great mastery of light and shadow which enabled Tintoretto to\r\nput into his pictures all the poetry there was in his soul without once\r\ntempting us to think that he might have found better expression in\r\nwords. The poetry which quickens most of his works in the Scuola di San\r\nRocco is almost entirely a matter of light and colour. What is it but\r\nthe light that changes the solitudes in which the Magdalen and St. Mary\r\nof Egypt are sitting, into dreamlands seen by poets in their moments of\r\nhappiest inspiration? What but light and colour, the gloom and chill of\r\nevening, with the white-stoled figure standing resignedly before the\r\njudge, that give the \"Christ before Pilate\" its sublime magic? What,\r\nagain, but light, colour, and the star-procession of cherubs that imbue\r\nthe realism of the \"Annunciation\" with music which thrills us through\r\nand through?\r\n\r\nReligion and poetry did not exist for Tintoretto because the love and\r\ncultivation of the Muses was a duty prescribed by the Greeks and Romans,\r\nand because the love of God and the saints was prescribed by the Church;\r\nbut rather, as was the case with the best people of his time, because\r\nboth poetry and religion were useful to man. They helped him to forget\r\nwhat was mean and sordid in life, they braced him to his task, and\r\nconsoled him for his disappointments. Religion answered to an\r\never-living need of the human heart. The Bible was no longer a mere\r\ndocument wherewith to justify Christian dogma. It was rather a series of\r\nparables and symbols pointing at all times to the path that led to a\r\nfiner and nobler life. Why then continue to picture Christ and the\r\nApostles, the Patriarchs and Prophets, as persons living under Roman\r\nrule, wearing the Roman toga, and walking about in the landscape of a\r\nRoman bas-relief? Christ and the Apostles, the Patriarchs and Prophets,\r\nwere the embodiment of living principles and of living ideals.\r\nTintoretto felt this so vividly that he could not think of them\r\notherwise than as people of his own kind, living under conditions easily\r\nintelligible to himself and to his fellow-men. Indeed, the more\r\nintelligible and the more familiar the look and garb and surroundings of\r\nbiblical and saintly personages, the more would they drive home the\r\nprinciples and ideas they incarnated. So Tintoretto did not hesitate to\r\nturn every biblical episode into a picture of what the scene would look\r\nlike had it taken place under his own eyes, nor to tinge it with his own\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nHis conception of the human form was, it is true, colossal, although the\r\nslender elegance that was then coming into fashion, as if in protest\r\nagainst physical force and organisation, influenced him considerably in\r\nhis construction of the female figure; but the effect which he must\r\nalways have produced upon his contemporaries, and which most of his\r\nworks still produce, is one of astounding reality as well as of wide\r\nsweep and power. Thus, in the \"Discovery of the Body of St. Mark,\" in\r\nthe Brera, and in the \"Storm Rising while the Corpse is being Carried\r\nthrough the Streets of Alexandria,\" in the Royal Palace at Venice, the\r\nfigures, although colossal, are so energetic and so easy in movement,\r\nand the effects of perspective and of light and atmosphere are so on a\r\nlevel with the gigantic figures, that the eye at once adapts itself to\r\nthe scale, and you feel as if you too partook of the strength and health\r\nof heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XVII. Value of Minor Episodes in Art.=--That feeling for reality which\r\nmade the great painters look upon a picture as the representation of a\r\ncubic content of atmosphere enveloping all the objects depicted, made\r\nthem also consider the fact that the given quantity of atmosphere is\r\nsure to contain other objects than those the artist wants for his\r\npurpose. He is free to leave them out, of course, but in so far as he\r\ndoes, so far is he from producing an effect of reality. The eye does not\r\nsee everything, but all the eye would naturally see along with the\r\nprincipal objects, must be painted, or the picture will not look true\r\nto life. This incorporation of small episodes running parallel with the\r\nsubject rather than forming part of it, is one of the chief\r\ncharacteristics of modern as distinguished from ancient art. It is this\r\nwhich makes the Elizabethan drama so different from the Greek. It is\r\nthis again which already separates the works of Duccio and Giotto from\r\nthe plastic arts of Antiquity. Painting lends itself willingly to the\r\nconsideration of minor episodes, and for that reason is almost as well\r\nfitted to be in touch with modern life as the novel itself. Such a\r\ntreatment saves a picture from looking prepared and cold, just as light\r\nand atmosphere save it from rigidity and crudeness.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of this can be found among Italian masters than\r\nTintoretto's \"Crucifixion\" in the Scuola di San Rocco. The scene is a\r\nvast one, and although Christ is on the Cross, life does not stop. To\r\nmost of the people gathered there, what takes place is no more than a\r\ncommon execution. Many of them are attending to it as to a tedious duty.\r\nOthers work away at some menial task more or less connected with the\r\nCrucifixion, as unconcerned as cobblers humming over their last. Most of\r\nthe people in the huge canvas are represented, as no doubt they were in\r\nlife, without much personal feeling about Christ. His own friends are\r\npainted with all their grief and despair, but the others are allowed to\r\nfeel as they please. The painter does not try to give them the proper\r\nemotions. If one of the great novelists of to-day, if Tolstoi, for\r\ninstance, were to describe the Crucifixion, his account would read as if\r\nit were a description of Tintoretto's picture. But Tintoretto's fairness\r\nwent even further than letting all the spectators feel as they pleased\r\nabout what he himself believed to be the greatest event that ever took\r\nplace. Among this multitude he allowed the light of heaven to shine upon\r\nthe wicked as well as upon the good, and the air to refresh them all\r\nequally. In other words, this enormous canvas is a great sea of air and\r\nlight at the bottom of which the scene takes place. Without the\r\natmosphere and the just distribution of light, it would look as lifeless\r\nand desolate, in spite of the crowd and animation, as if it were the\r\nbottom of a dried up sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XVIII. Tintoretto's Portraits.=--While all these advances were being\r\nmade, the art of portraiture had not stood still. Its popularity had\r\nonly increased as the years went on. Titian was too busy with\r\ncommissions for foreign princes to supply the great demand there was in\r\nVenice alone. Tintoretto painted portraits not only with much of the air\r\nof good breeding of Titian's likenesses, but with even greater\r\nsplendour, and with an astonishing rapidity of execution. The Venetian\r\nportrait, it will be remembered, was expected to be more than a\r\nlikeness. It was expected to give pleasure to the eye, and to stimulate\r\nthe emotions. Tintoretto was ready to give ample satisfaction to all\r\nsuch expectations. His portraits, although they are not so\r\nindividualised as Lotto's, nor such close studies of character as\r\nTitian's, always render the man at his best, in glowing health, full of\r\nlife and determination. They give us the sensuous pleasure we get from\r\njewels, and at the same time they make us look back with amazement to a\r\nState where the human plant was in such vigour as to produce old men of\r\nthe kind represented in most of Tintoretto's portraits.\r\n\r\nWith Tintoretto ends the universal interest the Venetian school arouses;\r\nfor although painting does not deteriorate in a day any more than it\r\ngrows to maturity in the same brief moment, the story of the decay has\r\nnone of the fascination of the growth. But several artists remain to be\r\nconsidered who were not of the Venetian school in the strict sense of\r\nthe term, but who have always been included within it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XIX. Venetian Art and the Provinces.=--The Venetian provinces were held\r\ntogether not merely by force of rule. In language and feeling no less\r\nthan in government, they formed a distinct unit within the Italian\r\npeninsula. Painting being so truly a product of the soil as it was in\r\nItaly during the Renaissance, the art of the provinces could not help\r\nholding the same close relation to the art of Venice that their language\r\nand modes of feeling held. But a difference must be made at once between\r\ntowns like Verona, with a school of at least as long a growth and with\r\nas independent an evolution as the school of Venice itself, and towns\r\nlike Vicenza and Brescia whose chief painters never developed quite\r\nindependently of Venice or Verona. What makes Romanino and Moretto of\r\nBrescia, or even the powerful Montagna of Vicenza, except when they are\r\nat their very best, so much less enjoyable as a rule than the\r\nVenetians--that is to say the painters wholly educated in Venice,--is\r\nsomething they have in common with the Eclectics of a later day. They\r\nare ill at ease about their art, which is no longer the utterly\r\nunpremeditated outcome of a natural impulse. They saw greater painting\r\nthan their own in Venice and Verona, and not unfrequently their own\r\nworks show an uncouth attempt to adopt that greatness, which comes out\r\nin exaggeration of colour even more than of form, and speaks for that\r\nwant of taste which is the indelible stamp of provincialism. But there\r\nwere Venetian towns without the traditions even of the schools of\r\nVicenza and Brescia, where, if you wanted to learn painting, you had to\r\napprentice yourself to somebody who had been taught by somebody who had\r\nbeen a pupil of one of Giovanni Bellini's pupils. This was particularly\r\ntrue of the towns in that long stretch of plain between the Julian Alps\r\nand the sea, known as Friuli. Friuli produced one painter of remarkable\r\ntalents and great force, Giovanni Antonio Pordenone, but neither his\r\ntalents nor his force, nor even later study in Venice, could erase from\r\nhis works that stamp of provincialism which he inherited from his first\r\nprovincial master.\r\n\r\nSuch artists as these, however, never gained great favour in the\r\ncapital. Those whom Venice drew to herself when her own strength was\r\nwaning and when, like Rome in her decline, she began to absorb into\r\nherself the talent of the provinces, were rather painters such as Paolo\r\nVeronese whose art, although of independent growth, was sufficiently\r\nlike her own to be readily understood, or painters with an entirely new\r\nvein, such as the Bassani.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XX. Paul Veronese.=--Paolo was the product of four or five generations of\r\nVeronese painters, the first two or three of which had spoken the\r\nlanguage of the whole mass of the people in a way that few other artists\r\nhad ever done. Consequently, in the early Renaissance, there were no\r\npainters in the North of Italy, and few even in Florence, who were not\r\ntouched by the influence of the Veronese. But Paolo's own immediate\r\npredecessors were no longer able to speak the language of the whole mass\r\nof the people. There was one class they left out entirely, the class to\r\nwhom Titian and Tintoretto appealed so strongly, the class that ruled,\r\nand that thought in the new way. Verona, being a dependency of Venice,\r\ndid no ruling, and certainly not at all so much thinking as Venice, and\r\nlife there continued healthful, simple, unconscious, untroubled by the\r\napproaching storm in the world's feelings. But although thought and\r\nfeeling may be slow in invading a town, fashion comes there quickly.\r\nSpanish fashions in dress, and Spanish ceremonial in manners reached\r\nVerona soon enough, and in Paolo Caliari we find all these fashions\r\nreflected, but health, simplicity, and unconsciousness as well. This\r\ncombination of seemingly opposite qualities forms his great charm for\r\nus to-day, and it must have proved as great an attraction to many of the\r\nVenetians of his own time, for they were already far enough removed from\r\nsimplicity to appreciate to the full his singularly happy combination of\r\nceremony and splendour with an almost childlike naturalness of feeling.\r\nPerhaps among his strongest admirers were the very men who most\r\nappreciated Titian's distinction and Tintoretto's poetry. But it is\r\ncurious to note that Paolo's chief employers were the monasteries. His\r\ncheerfulness, and his frank and joyous worldliness, the qualities, in\r\nshort, which we find in his huge pictures of feasts, seem to have been\r\nparticularly welcome to those who were expected to make their meat and\r\ndrink of the very opposite qualities. This is no small comment on the\r\ntimes, and shows how thorough had been the permeation of the spirit of\r\nthe Renaissance when even the religious orders gave up their pretence to\r\nasceticism and piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXI. Bassano, Genre, and Landscape.=--Venetian painting would not have\r\nbeen the complete expression of the riper Renaissance if it had\r\nentirely neglected the country. City people have a natural love of the\r\ncountry, but when it was a matter of doubt whether a man would ever\r\nreturn if he ventured out of the town-gates, as was the case in the\r\nMiddle Ages, this love had no chance of showing itself. It had to wait\r\nuntil the country itself was safe for wayfarers, a state of things which\r\ncame about in Italy with the gradual submission of the country to the\r\nrule of the neighbouring cities and with the general advance of\r\ncivilisation. During the Renaissance the love of the country and its\r\npleasures received an immense impulse from Latin authors. What the great\r\nRomans without exception recommended, an Italian was not slow to adopt,\r\nparticularly when, as in this case, it harmonised with natural\r\ninclination and with an already common practice. It was the usual thing\r\nwith those who could afford to do so to retire to the villa for a large\r\npart of the year. Classic poets helped such Italians to appreciate the\r\nsimplicity of the country and to feel a little of its beauty. Many took\r\nsuch delight in country life that they wished to have reminders of it\r\nin town. It may have been in response to some such half formulated wish\r\nthat Palma began to paint his \"Sante Conversazioni,\"--groups of saintly\r\npersonages gathered under pleasant trees in pretty landscapes. His\r\npupil, Bonifazio, continued the same line, gradually, however,\r\ndiscarding the traditional group of Madonna and saints, and, under such\r\ntitles as \"The Rich Man's Feast\" or \"The Finding of Moses,\" painting all\r\nthe scenes of fashionable country life, music on the terrace of a villa,\r\nhunting parties, and picnics in the forest.\r\n\r\nBonifazio's pupil, Jacopo Bassano, no less fond of painting country\r\nscenes, did not however confine himself to representing city people in\r\ntheir parks. His pictures were for the inhabitants of the small\r\nmarket-town from which he takes his name, where inside the gates you\r\nstill see men and women in rustic garb crouching over their\r\nmany-coloured wares; and where, just outside the walls, you may see all\r\nthe ordinary occupations connected with farming and grazing. Inspired,\r\nalthough unawares, by the new idea of giving perfectly modern versions\r\nof biblical stories, Bassano introduced into nearly every picture he\r\npainted episodes from the life in the streets of Bassano, and in the\r\ncounty just outside the gates. Even Orpheus in his hands becomes a\r\nfarmer's lad fiddling to the barnyard fowls.\r\n\r\nBassano's pictures and those of his two sons, who followed him very\r\nclosely, found great favour in Venice and elsewhere, because they were\r\nsuch unconscious renderings of simple country life, a kind of life whose\r\ncharm seemed greater and greater the more fashionable and ceremonious\r\nprivate life in the city became. But this was far from being their only\r\ncharm. Just as the Church had educated people to understand painting as\r\na language, so the love of all the pleasant things that painting\r\nsuggested led in time to the love of this art as its own end, serving no\r\nobvious purpose either of decoration or suggestion, but giving pleasure\r\nby the skilful management of light and shadow, and by the intrinsic\r\nbeauty of the colours. The third quarter of the sixteenth century thus\r\nsaw the rise of the picture-fancier, and the success of the Bassani was\r\nso great because they appealed to this class in a special way. In\r\nVenice there had long been a love of objects for their sensuous beauty.\r\nAt an early date the Venetians had perfected an art in which there is\r\nscarcely any intellectual content whatever, and in which colour,\r\njewel-like or opaline, is almost everything. Venetian glass was at the\r\nsame time an outcome of the Venetians' love of sensuous beauty and a\r\ncontinual stimulant to it. Pope Paul II., for example, who was a\r\nVenetian, took such a delight in the colour and glow of jewels, that he\r\nwas always looking at them and always handling them. When painting,\r\naccordingly, had reached the point where it was no longer dependent upon\r\nthe Church, nor even expected to be decorative, but when it was used\r\npurely for pleasure, the day could not be far distant when people would\r\nexpect painting to give them the same enjoyment they received from\r\njewels and glass. In Bassano's works this taste found full satisfaction.\r\nMost of his pictures seem at first as dazzling, then as cooling and\r\nsoothing, as the best kind of stained glass; while the colouring of\r\ndetails, particularly of those under high lights, is jewel-like, as\r\nclear and deep and satisfying as rubies and emeralds.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be added after all that has been said about light and\r\natmosphere in connection with Titian and Tintoretto, and their handling\r\nof real life, that Bassano's treatment of both was even more masterly.\r\nIf this were not so, neither picture-fanciers of his own time, nor we\r\nnowadays, should care for his works as we do. They represent life in far\r\nmore humble phases than even the pictures of Tintoretto, and, without\r\nrecompensing effects of light and atmosphere, they would not be more\r\nenjoyable than the cheap work of the smaller Dutch masters. It must be\r\nadded, too, that without his jewel-like colouring, Bassano would often\r\nbe no more delightful than Teniers.\r\n\r\nAnother thing Bassano could not fail to do, working as he did in the\r\ncountry, and for country people, was to paint landscape. He had to paint\r\nthe real country, and his skill in the treatment of light and atmosphere\r\nwas great enough to enable him to do it well. Bassano was in fact the\r\nfirst modern landscape painter. Titian and Tintoretto and Giorgione,\r\nand even Bellini and Cima before them, had painted beautiful landscapes,\r\nbut they were seldom direct studies from nature. They were decorative\r\nbackgrounds, or fine harmonising accompaniments to the religious or\r\nhuman elements of the picture. They never failed to get grand and\r\neffective lines--a setting worthy of the subject. Bassano did not need\r\nsuch setting for his country versions of Bible stories, and he needed\r\nthem even less in his studies of rural life. For pictures of this kind\r\nthe country itself naturally seemed the best background and the best\r\naccompaniment possible,--indeed, the only kind desirable. Without\r\nknowing it, therefore, and without intending it, Bassano was the first\r\nItalian who tried to paint the country as it really is, and not arranged\r\nto look like scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXII. The Venetians and Velasquez.=--Had Bassano's qualities, however,\r\nbeen of the kind that appealed only to the collectors of his time, he\r\nwould scarcely rouse the strong interest we take in him. We care for him\r\nchiefly because he has so many of the more essential qualities of great\r\nart--truth to life, and spontaneity. He has another interest still, in\r\nthat he began to beat out the path which ended at last in Velasquez.\r\nIndeed, one of the attractions of the Venetian school of painting is\r\nthat, more than all others, it went to form that great Spanish master.\r\nHe began as a sort of follower of Bassano, but his style was not fixed\r\nbefore he had given years of study to Veronese, to Tintoretto, and to\r\nTitian.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXIII. Decline of Venetian Art.=--Bassano appealed to collectors by mere\r\naccident. He certainly did not work for them. The painters who came\r\nafter him and after Tintoretto no longer worked unconsciously, as\r\nVeronese did, nor for the whole intelligent class, as Titian and\r\nTintoretto had done, but for people who prided themselves on their\r\nconnoisseurship.\r\n\r\nPalma the Younger and Domenico Tintoretto began well enough as natural\r\nfollowers of Tintoretto, but before long they became aware of their\r\ninferiority to the masters who had preceded them, and, feeling no longer\r\nthe strength to go beyond them, fell back upon painting variations of\r\nthose pictures of Tintoretto and Titian which had proved most popular.\r\nSo their works recall the great masters, but only to bring out their own\r\nweakness. Padovanino, Liberi, and Pietro della Vecchia went even lower\r\ndown and shamelessly manufactured pictures which, in the distant markets\r\nfor which they were intended, passed for works of Titian, Veronese, and\r\nGiorgione. Nor are these pictures altogether unenjoyable. There are airs\r\nby the great composers we so love that we enjoy them even when woven\r\ninto the compositions of some third-rate master.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXIV. Longhi.=--But Venetian painting was not destined to die unnoticed.\r\nIn the eighteenth century, before the Republic entirely disappeared,\r\nVenice produced three or four painters who deserve at the least a place\r\nwith the best painters of that century. The constitution of the Venetian\r\nState had remained unchanged. Magnificent ceremonies still took place,\r\nVenice was still the most splendid and the most luxurious city in the\r\nworld. If the splendour and luxury were hollow, they were not more so\r\nthan elsewhere in Europe. The eighteenth century had the strength which\r\ncomes from great self-confidence and profound satisfaction with one's\r\nsurroundings. It was so self-satisfied that it could not dream of\r\nstriving to be much better than it was. Everything was just right; there\r\nseemed to be no great issues, no problems arising that human\r\nintelligence untrammelled by superstition could not instantly solve.\r\nEverybody was therefore in holiday mood, and the gaiety and frivolity of\r\nthe century were of almost as much account as its politics and culture.\r\nThere was no room for great distinctions. Hair-dressers and tailors\r\nfound as much consideration as philosophers and statesmen at a lady's\r\nlevee. People were delighted with their own occupations, their whole\r\nlives; and whatever people delight in, that they will have represented\r\nin art. The love for pictures was by no means dead in Venice, and Longhi\r\npainted for the picture-loving Venetians their own lives in all their\r\nordinary domestic and fashionable phases. In the hair-dressing scenes\r\nwe hear the gossip of the periwigged barber; in the dressmaking scenes,\r\nthe chatter of the maid; in the dancing-school, the pleasant music of\r\nthe violin. There is no tragic note anywhere. Everybody dresses, dances,\r\nmakes bows, takes coffee, as if there were nothing else in the world\r\nthat wanted doing. A tone of high courtesy, of great refinement, coupled\r\nwith an all-pervading cheerfulness, distinguishes Longhi's pictures from\r\nthe works of Hogarth, at once so brutal and so full of presage of\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXV. Canaletto and Guardi.=--Venice herself had not grown less beautiful\r\nin her decline. Indeed, the building which occupies the very centre of\r\nthe picture Venice leaves in the mind, the Salute, was not built until\r\nthe seventeenth century. This was the picture that the Venetian himself\r\nloved to have painted for him, and that the stranger wanted to carry\r\naway. Canale painted Venice with a feeling for space and atmosphere,\r\nwith a mastery over the delicate effects of mist peculiar to the city,\r\nthat make his views of the Salute, the Grand Canal, and the Piazzetta\r\nstill seem more like Venice than all the pictures of them that have been\r\npainted since. Later in the century Canale was followed by Guardi, who\r\nexecuted smaller views with more of an eye for the picturesque, and for\r\nwhat may be called instantaneous effects, thus anticipating both the\r\nRomantic and the Impressionist painters of our own century.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXVI. Tiepolo.=--But delightful as Longhi, Canale, and Guardi are, and\r\nimbued as they are with the spirit of their own century, they lack the\r\nquality of force, without which there can be no really impressive style.\r\nThis quality their contemporary Tiepolo possessed to the utmost. His\r\nenergy, his feeling for splendour, his mastery over his craft, place him\r\nalmost on a level with the great Venetians of the sixteenth century,\r\nalthough he never allows one to forget what he owes to them,\r\nparticularly to Veronese. The grand scenes he paints differ from those\r\nof his predecessor not so much in mere inferiority of workmanship, as in\r\na lack of that simplicity and candour which never failed Paolo, no\r\nmatter how proud the event he might be portraying. Tiepolo's people are\r\nhaughty, as if they felt that to keep a firm hold on their dignity they\r\ncould not for a moment relax their faces and figures from a monumental\r\nlook and bearing. They evidently feel themselves so superior that they\r\nare not pleasant to live with, although they carry themselves so well,\r\nand are dressed with such splendour, that once in a while it is a great\r\npleasure to look at them. It was Tiepolo's vision of the world that was\r\nat fault, and his vision of the world was at fault only because the\r\nworld itself was at fault. Paolo saw a world touched only by the\r\nfashions of the Spanish Court, while Tiepolo lived among people whose\r\nvery hearts had been vitiated by its measureless haughtiness.\r\n\r\nBut Tiepolo's feeling for strength, for movement, and for colour was\r\ngreat enough to give a new impulse to art. At times he seems not so much\r\nthe last of the old masters as the first of the new. The works he left\r\nin Spain do more than a little to explain the revival of painting in\r\nthat country under Goya; and Goya, in his turn, had a great influence\r\nupon many of the best French artists of our own times.\r\n\r\n\r\n=XXVII. Influence of Venetian Art.=--Thus, Venetian painting before it\r\nwholly died, flickered up again strong enough to light the torch that is\r\nburning so steadily now. Indeed, not the least attraction of the\r\nVenetian masters is their note of modernity, by which I mean the feeling\r\nthey give us that they were on the high road to the art of to-day. We\r\nhave seen how on two separate occasions Venetian painters gave an\r\nimpulse to Spaniards, who in turn have had an extraordinary influence on\r\nmodern painting. It would be easy, too, although it is not my purpose,\r\nto show how much other schools of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, such as the Flemish, led by Rubens, and the English led by\r\nReynolds, owed to the Venetians. My endeavour has been to explain some\r\nof the attractions of the school, and particularly to show its close\r\ndependence upon the thought and feeling of the Renaissance. This is\r\nperhaps its greatest interest, for being such a complete expression of\r\nthe riper spirit of the Renaissance, it helps us to a larger\r\nunderstanding of a period which has in itself the fascination of youth,\r\nand which is particularly attractive to us, because the spirit that\r\nanimates us is singularly like the better spirit of that epoch. We, too,\r\nare possessed of boundless curiosity. We, too, have an almost\r\nintoxicating sense of human capacity. We, too, believe in a great future\r\nfor humanity, and nothing has yet happened to check our delight in\r\ndiscovery or our faith in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO THE WORKS OF THE PRINCIPAL VENETIAN PAINTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nPublic galleries are mentioned first, then private collections, and\r\nchurches last. The principal public gallery is always understood after\r\nthe simple mention of a city or town. Thus, Paris means Paris, Louvre,\r\nLondon means London, National Gallery, etc.\r\n\r\nAn interrogation point after the number or title of a picture indicates\r\nthat its attribution to the given painter is doubtful.\r\n\r\nDistinctly early or late works are marked E. or L.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that the attributions here given are not based\r\non official catalogues, and are often at variance with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONELLO DA MESSINA.\r\n\r\n=B.= Circa 1444: d. circa 1493.
