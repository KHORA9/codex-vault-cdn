Thus in the course of years they have made a large\r\naddition to the number of documentary sources available to the student\r\nof that period. First they published, in 1906, in two handsome\r\nvolumes, the _Correspondence of William Pitt, when Secretary of State,\r\nwith Colonial Governors and Military and Naval Commanders in America_,\r\nedited by the late Miss Gertrude Selwyn Kimball, containing material\r\nof great importance to the history of the colonies as a whole, and of\r\nthe management of the French and Indian War. Next, in 1911 and 1914,\r\nthey published the two volumes of Professor James C. Ballagh's\r\nvaluable edition of the _Letters of Richard Henry Lee_. Then, in 1912,\r\nthey brought out, again in two volumes, the _Correspondence of\r\nGovernor William Shirley_, edited by Dr. Charles H. Lincoln, and\r\nillustrating the history of several colonies, particularly those of\r\nNew England, during the period of what in our colonial history is\r\ncalled King George's War. More recently, in 1916, the Society\r\npublished an entertaining volume of hitherto unprinted _Travels in the\r\nAmerican Colonies_, edited by Dr. Newton D. Mereness.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved that the next volume after these should be devoted to\r\ndocuments relating to maritime history. In proportion to its\r\nimportance, that aspect of our colonial history has in general\r\nreceived too little attention. In time of peace the colonists, nearly\r\nall of whom dwelt within a hundred miles of ocean or tidewater,\r\nmaintained constantly a maritime commerce that had a large importance\r\nto their economic life and gave employment to no small part of their\r\npopulation. In time of war, their naval problems and dangers and\r\nachievements were hardly less important than those of land warfare,\r\nbut have been far less exploited, whether in narrative histories or in\r\nvolumes of documentary materials. Accordingly the Society's Committee\r\non Publication readily acceded to the suggestion that a volume should\r\nbe made up of documents illustrating the history of privateering and\r\npiracy as these stand related to the life of America during the\r\ncolonial period--for it is agreed that few aspects of our maritime\r\nhistory in that period have greater importance and interest than these\r\ntwo. In some of our colonial wars, as later in those of the Revolution\r\nand of 1812, American privateering assumed such proportions as to make\r\nit, for brief periods, one of the leading American industries. We\r\ncannot quite say the same concerning American piracy, and indeed it\r\nmight be thought disrespectful to our ancestors--or predecessors, for\r\npirates mostly died young and left few descendants--but at least it\r\nwill be conceded that piracy at times flourished in American waters,\r\nthat not a few of the pirates and of those on shore who received their\r\ngoods and otherwise aided them were Americans, that their activities\r\nhad an important influence on the development of American commerce,\r\nand that documents relative to piracy make interesting reading.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for regret and on the editor's part for apology, that\r\nthe book should have been so long in preparation. Work on it was begun\r\nprosperously before our country was engaged in war, but the \"spare\r\ntime\" which the editor can command, always slight in amount, was much\r\nreduced during the period of warfare. Moreover, the Society, very\r\nproperly, determined that, so long as war continued, the publication\r\nof their volumes and the expenditures now attendant upon printing\r\nought to be postponed in favor of those patriotic undertakings,\r\nespecially for the relief of suffering, which have made their name\r\ngrateful to all lovers of the Navy and in all places where the\r\n_Comfort_ and the _Mercy_ have sailed.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected against the plan of this book, that privateering\r\nand piracy should not be conjoined in one volume, with documents\r\nintermingled in one chronological order, lest the impression be\r\ncreated that piracy and privateering were much the same. It is true\r\nthat, in theory and in legal definition, they are widely different\r\nthings and stand on totally different bases. Legally, a privateer is\r\nan armed vessel (or its commander) which, in time of war, though\r\nowners and officers and crew are private persons, has a commission\r\nfrom a belligerent government to commit acts of warfare on vessels of\r\nits enemy. Legally, a pirate is one who commits robbery or other acts\r\nof violence on the sea (or on the land through descent from the sea)\r\nwithout having any authority from, and independently of, any organized\r\ngovernment or political society. (Fighting and bloodshed and murder,\r\nit may be remarked by the way, though natural concomitants of the\r\npirate's trade, are not, as is often supposed, essentials of the crime\r\nof piracy.) But wide as is the legal distinction between the\r\nauthorized warfare of the privateer and the unauthorized violence of\r\nthe pirate, in practice it was very difficult to keep the privateer\r\nand his crew, far from the eye of authority, within the bounds of\r\nlegal conduct, or to prevent him from broadening out his operations\r\ninto piracy, especially if a merely privateering cruise was proving\r\nunprofitable. Privateering was open to many abuses, and it was not\r\nwithout good reason that the leading powers of Europe, in 1856, by the\r\nDeclaration of Paris, agreed to its abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe object of the following collection of documents is not to give the\r\nwhole history of any episode of piracy or of the career of any\r\nprivateer, but rather, by appropriate selection, to illustrate, as\r\nwell as is possible in one volume, all the different aspects of both\r\nemployments, and to present specimens of all the different sorts of\r\npapers to which they gave rise. Nearly all the pieces are documents\r\nhitherto unprinted, but a few that have already been printed, mostly\r\nin books not easy of access, have been included in order to round out\r\na story or a series. The collection ends with the termination of the\r\nlast colonial war in 1763. Presented in chronological order, it may\r\nhave a casual, as it certainly has a miscellaneous, appearance. But\r\nvariety was intended, and on closer inspection and comparison the\r\nselection will be seen to have a more methodical character than at\r\nfirst appears, corresponding to the systematic procedure followed in\r\nprivateering, in prize cases, and in trials for piracy.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of war in which Great Britain was involved, it was\r\ncustomary for the King to issue a commission to the Lord High Admiral\r\n(or to the Lords of the Admiralty appointed to execute that office)\r\nauthorizing him (or them) to empower proper officials, such as\r\ncolonial governors, to grant letters of marque, or privateering\r\ncommissions, to suitable persons under adequate safeguards.[1] The\r\nLords of the Admiralty then issued warrants to the colonial governors\r\n(see doc. no. 127), authorizing them to issue such commissions or\r\nletters of marque. A specimen American privateering commission may be\r\nseen in doc. no. 144; a Portuguese letter of marque, and a paper by\r\nwhich its recipient purported to assign it to another, in docs. no. 14\r\nand no. 15. Royal instructions were issued to all commanders of\r\nprivateers (doc. no. 126), and each was required to furnish, or\r\nbondsmen were required to furnish on his behalf, caution or\r\nsecurity[2] for the proper observance of these instructions and the\r\npayment of all dues to the crown or Admiralty. Relations between the\r\ncommander and the crew, except as regulated by the superior authority\r\nof these instructions and of the prize acts or other statutes, were\r\ngoverned by the articles of agreement (doc. no. 202) signed when\r\nenlisting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See R.G. Marsden in _English Historical Review_, XXI.\r\n251-257, and a commission in Rymer's _Foedera_, XVIII. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Specimen (1762) in Anthony Stokes, _A View of the\r\nConstitution of the British Colonies_ (London, 1783), pp. 315-317.]\r\n\r\nThese were the essential documents of a privateering voyage. There\r\nwould probably be also accounts for supplies, like John Tweedy's very\r\ncurious bill for medicines (doc. no. 158), and accounts between crew\r\nand owners (doc. no. 146), and general accounts of the voyage (doc.\r\nno. 159). There might be an agreement of two privateers to cruise\r\ntogether and divide the spoil (doc. no. 160). There might even be a\r\njournal of the whole voyage, like the extraordinarily interesting\r\njournal kept on the privateer _Revenge_ by the captain's\r\nquartermaster in 1741 (doc. no. 145), one of the very few such\r\nnarratives preserved. Other documents of various kinds, illustrating\r\nmiscellaneous incidents of privateering, will be found elsewhere in\r\nthe volume.\r\n\r\nBoth privateers and naval vessels belonging to the government made\r\nprize of ships and goods belonging to the enemy, but many questions\r\nwere certain to arise concerning the legality of captures and\r\nconcerning the proper ownership and disposal of ships and goods. Hence\r\nthe necessity for prize courts, acting under admiralty law and the law\r\nof nations. The instructions to privateers required them (see doc. no.\r\n126, section III.) to bring captured ships or goods into some port of\r\nGreat Britain or her colonial dominions, for adjudication by such a\r\ncourt. In England, it was the High Court of Admiralty that tried such\r\ncases. At the beginning of a war, a commission under the Great\r\nSeal,[3] addressed to the Lords of the Admiralty, instructed them to\r\nissue a warrant to the judge of that court, authorizing him during the\r\nduration of the war to take cognizance of prize causes. After 1689, it\r\nwas customary to provide for trial of admiralty causes in colonial\r\nports by giving to each colonial governor, in addition to his\r\ncommission as governor, a commission as vice-admiral. Before 1689,\r\nthis was done in a few instances, chiefly of proprietary colonies, the\r\nearliest such instance being that exhibited in our doc. no. 1; but in\r\nthe case of colonies having no royal governor (corporation colonies)\r\nwe find various courts in that earlier period exercising admiralty\r\njurisdiction (docs. no. 8, no. 25, no. 48, and no. 105, note 1). From\r\nQueen Anne's reign on (doc. no. 102), jurisdiction in prize causes was\r\nconferred, as in the case of the judge of the High Court of Admiralty\r\nin London, by warrant (doc. no. 182) from the Lord High Admiral or\r\nLords of the Admiralty pursuant to the commission issued to them, as\r\nstated above, at the beginning of the war. In doc. no. 116 we see the\r\njudge of the High Court of Admiralty expressing the belief that it\r\nwould be better if all prizes were brought to his court in London for\r\nadjudication, but the inconvenience would have been too great.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Such a commission (1748) is printed in R.G. Marsden, _Law\r\nand Custom of the Sea_ (Navy Records Society), II. 279, and another\r\n(1756) in Stokes, p. 278.]\r\n\r\nThe governor's commission as vice-admiral, issued (after 1689, at any\r\nrate) under the great seal of the High Court of Admiralty, gave him\r\nauthority to hold an admiralty court in person. Often the governor was\r\nnot well fitted for such work, though not often so frank as Sir Henry\r\nMorgan (doc. no. 46, note 1) in admitting his deficiencies. As\r\nadmiralty business increased, it became customary to appoint admiralty\r\njudges to hold vice-admiralty courts in individual colonies, or in\r\ngroups of colonies. Sometimes, especially in the earlier period, they\r\nwere commissioned by the governor of the colony acting under a warrant\r\nfrom the Lords of the Admiralty (doc. no. 69) empowering him so to do;\r\nmore often they were commissioned directly by those lords, under the\r\ngreat seal of the Admiralty. Doc. no. 180 is a commission of the\r\nformer sort, doc. no. 181 of the latter. When war broke out, authority\r\nto try prize cases was conveyed, as above, to the vice-admiral, the\r\nvice-admiralty judge, and their deputies.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of a prize case, the first essential document was the\r\nlibel (docs. no. 99, no. 128, no. 165, no. 184, and no. 188), by which\r\nclaim was laid to ship or goods. Witnesses were examined, chiefly by\r\nmeans of the systematic series of questions called standing\r\ninterrogatories (doc. no. 183). Their testimony, taken down in written\r\ndepositions, constitutes much the largest class of documents in this\r\nvolume. Most narratives of privateering or of piracy are found in the\r\nform of depositions. Reports of trials, embracing proceedings and\r\ndocuments and testimony, are found in docs. no. 128, no. 143, and no.\r\n165; sentences or decrees of the judge in docs. no. 143, no. 150, and\r\nno. 155; inventories of prizes in docs. no. 33 and no. 161; an account\r\nof sales in doc. no. 186.\r\n\r\nIf a party to a prize appealed from the sentence of the vice-admiralty\r\ncourt (docs. no. 151 and no. 196), he was required to give bond (doc.\r\nno. 152) for due prosecution of the appeal in England. From 1628 to\r\n1708 such appeals were heard by the High Court of Admiralty; after\r\n1708 they went to a body of privy councillors specially commissioned\r\nfor the purpose, called the Lords Commissioners of Appeal in Prize\r\nCauses (see doc. no. 151, note 1). A specimen of a decree of that\r\ntribunal reversing the sentence of a colonial vice-admiralty court is\r\nin doc. no. 195.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For a report of these commissioners _approving_ the\r\nsentence of the court below, see Stokes, pp. 325-326.]\r\n\r\nPiracy being from its very nature a less formal proceeding than\r\nprivateering, there are fewer formal documents to present as essential\r\nto its history. In the seventeenth century, there are instances of\r\ntrials for piracy by various courts: _e.g._, the Court of Assistants\r\nin Massachusetts in 1675 (doc. no. 41, note 1) and the Massachusetts\r\nSuperior Court in 1694 (doc. no. 56, note 2). But the regular method,\r\nwhich came to prevail, was trial by special commissions appointed for\r\nthe purpose, similar to those which were appointed for the trial of\r\npirates in England by virtue of the statute 28 Henry VIII. c. 15\r\n(1536). We have such a colonial commission, appointed by the governor,\r\nin doc. no. 51 (1683). In 1700 the statute 11 and 12 William III. c. 7\r\nextended to the plantations the crown's authority to appoint such\r\ncommissions (see docs. no. 104, note 1, no. 106, note 1, and no. 201).\r\nA curious signed agreement to commit piracy will be found in doc. no.\r\n50; indictments for that crime in docs. no. 56, no. 119, and no. 120;\r\npartial records of trials in docs. no. 112, no. 113, and nos. 119-122.\r\nA full account of an execution, explicit enough to satisfy the most\r\nmorbid curiosity, is presented in doc. no. 104. Nos. 123 and 124 are\r\nformal bills for the execution, the digging of the graves, and the\r\ncheering drams which the executioners found needful after their grisly\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut if American colonial piracy presents a smaller array of legal\r\ndocuments than American colonial privateering, it makes up for it by\r\nits rich abundance of picturesque narrative and detail. The pieces\r\nhere brought together show us piracy off Lisbon and in the East Indies\r\nand at Madagascar, at Portobello and Panama and in the South Sea, in\r\nthe West Indies, and all along the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland\r\nto the coast of Guiana. They exhibit to us every relation from that of\r\nthe most innocent victim to that of the most hardened pirate chief.\r\nThey make it clear how narrow was sometimes the line that divided\r\npiracy and privateering, and how difficult it must have been to learn\r\nthe truth from witnesses so conflicting and of such dubious\r\ncharacters, testifying concerning actions of lawless men in remote\r\nseas or on lonely shores.\r\n\r\nMost of the pirates famed in story, who had anything to do with\r\ncolonial America, appear in one way or another in these papers. On the\r\nhistory of Henry Every, for instance, and even on the oft-told tale of\r\nWilliam Kidd, not a little new light is cast. Kidd's letters from\r\nprison, the letter and petitions of his wife, the depositions of\r\ncompanions, the additional letters of Bellomont, make the story live\r\nagain, even though no new evidence appears that is perfectly\r\nconclusive as to the still-debated question of his degree of guilt.\r\nThe wonderful buccaneering adventures of Bartholomew Sharp and his\r\ncompanions, 1680-1682, at the Isthmus of Panama and all along the west\r\ncoast of South America, are newly illustrated by long anonymous\r\nnarratives, artless but effective. And indeed, to speak more\r\ngenerally, it is hoped that there are few aspects of the pirate's\r\ntrade that are not somehow represented in these pages.\r\n\r\nAt least it will not be denied that the documents, whether for piracy\r\nor for privateering, show a considerable variety of origins. Their\r\nauthors range from a Signer of the Declaration of Independence to an\r\nIrishwoman keeping a boarding-house in Havana, from a minister of\r\nLouis XIV. or a judge of the High Court of Admiralty to the most\r\nilliterate sailor, from Governor John Endicott, most rigid of\r\nPuritans, to the keeper of a rendezvous for pirates and receiver of\r\ntheir ill-gotten goods. Witnesses or writers of many nationalities\r\nappear: American, Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Frenchmen, Dutchmen,\r\nSpaniards, a Portuguese, a Dane or Sleswicker, a Bohemian, a Greek, a\r\nJew. The languages of the documents are English, French, Dutch,\r\nSpanish, Portuguese, and Latin. Though none of them are in German or\r\nby Germans, not the least interesting pieces in the volume are those\r\n(docs. no. 43, no. 48, and no. 49) which show a curious connection of\r\nAmerican colonial history with the very first (and characteristically\r\nillegal and unscrupulous) exploits of the Brandenburg-Prussian navy.\r\n\r\nThe range of repositories from which the documents have been procured\r\nis also considerable. Many were found in the state archives of\r\nMassachusetts, many in the files of the Supreme Judicial Court for\r\nSuffolk County, many in the collections of the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society, others in the archives of Rhode Island and New\r\nYork, in the office of the surrogate of New York City, and in the New\r\nYork Public Library. A very important source of material,\r\nindispensable indeed for certain classes of document, was the records\r\nand papers of the vice-admiralty courts of the colonial period.\r\nExtensive portions still remain in the case of four of these courts,\r\nat Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston (see the first\r\nfoot-notes to docs. no. 126, no. 184, no. 165, and no. 106,\r\nrespectively). A large number of the documents, larger indeed than\r\nfrom any other repository but one, were drawn from the inexhaustible\r\nstores of the Public Record Office in London, namely, from the\r\nAdmiralty and Colonial Office Papers. Others came from the Privy\r\nCouncil Office; a few, but among them two of the longest and most\r\ninteresting, from among the Sloane and Harleian manuscripts in the\r\nBritish Museum; one whole group from the Rawlinson manuscripts in the\r\nBodleian Library at Oxford. Three of the Kidd documents were obtained\r\nfrom among the manuscripts of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey.\r\nSeveral of the pieces, and a number of lesser extracts used in\r\nannotations, were taken from colonial newspapers, and two from printed\r\nbooks not often seen.\r\n\r\nArchivists and librarians have assisted the editor with their\r\ncustomary and never-failing kindness. It is a pleasure to express his\r\ngratitude to Mr. J.J. Tracy and Mr. John H. Edmonds, former and\r\npresent archivists of Massachusetts, Mr. Herbert O. Brigham of the\r\nRhode Island archives, Mr. A.J.F. van Laer and Mr. Peter Nelson of\r\nthose of New York; to Mr. Worthington C. Ford and Mr. Julius H.\r\nTuttle of the Massachusetts Historical Society; to Hon. Charles M.\r\nHough, judge of the United States Circuit Court in New York; to Miss\r\nC.C. Helm of his office; to the late Miss Josephine Murphy, custodian\r\nof the Suffolk Files; to Miss Mabel L. Webber, secretary and librarian\r\nof the South Carolina Historical Society; to Mr. Victor H. Paltsits of\r\nthe New York Public Library; to Rev. Richard W. Goulding, librarian to\r\nthe Duke of Portland; and to the authorities of the Public Record\r\nOffice, the Privy Council Office, the British Museum, and the Bodleian\r\nLibrary. Special thanks are due to the officials of three libraries in\r\nwhich the work of annotation was mostly done--the Library of Congress,\r\nthat of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and that of Bowdoin\r\nCollege. On a few nautical points the editor had the advice of his old\r\nfriend the late Captain Charles Cate of North Edgecomb, Maine. And\r\nespecially he has to thank the chairman of the Committee on\r\nPublication, Mrs. Charles E. Rieman, for her interest in the work and\r\nfor the exemplary patience with which she has borne the delays in its\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps needless to say that the spelling of the originals has\r\nbeen carefully preserved; it is hoped that it would not be thought to\r\nbe that of the editor. The punctuation of the originals has not been\r\ndeemed equally sacred. In general, it has been reproduced, but where\r\nsmall alterations would make the sense clear to the modern reader but\r\ncould not change it, or where that same effect would be produced by\r\nintroducing punctuation-marks, which writers nearly illiterate often\r\nomitted entirely, it has seemed the part of good sense to make\r\nreading-matter readable. Also, names of vessels have been uniformly\r\nitalicized even when not underscored in the original manuscripts.\r\nDates previous to 1752 are old-style dates unless, as in the case of\r\nDutch or French documents, new style is indicated.\r\n\r\nJ.

Commission from the Providence Island Company to Governor\r\nNathaniel Butler as Vice Admiral. April 23, 1638._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Public Record Office of Great Britain, C.O. 124:1, p.\r\n118. This document and the next take us back to an almost-forgotten\r\ncolonial experiment of the English Puritans, contemporary with their\r\nundertakings in New England but far removed from them in locality. Old\r\nProvidence Island--to be distinguished from New Providence (Nassau) in\r\nthe Bahamas--is an isolated little island in the western Caribbean\r\nlying off the coast of Nicaragua. It now belongs to Colombia, and is\r\noften called Santa Catalina. In 1630 a company of English investors,\r\ndesiring to found a Puritan colony, and also to oppose Spain in the\r\nCaribbean, obtained from Charles I. a patent for a large area\r\nincluding Providence and other islands. John Pym was their leading\r\nmember. The history of their colony is interestingly recounted in\r\nProfessor A.P. Newton's _The Colonizing Activities of the English\r\nPuritans_ (New Haven, 1914). The colony became merely a base for\r\nprivateering against the Spaniards, who conquered and suppressed it in\r\n1641. Thomas Gage, who passed by the island in a Spanish ship in 1637,\r\nsays, \"The greatest feare that I perceived possessed the Spaniards in\r\nthis Voyage, was about the Island of Providence, called by them Sta.\r\nCatarina or St. Catharine, from whence they feared lest some English\r\nShips should come out against them with great strength. They cursed\r\nthe English in it, and called the Island the den of theeves and\r\nPirates.\" _The English American, or A New Survey of the West-India's_\r\n(London, 1648), p. 199. For the whole matter of West Indian\r\nbuccaneering, see Miss Violet Barbour's article, \"Privateers and\r\nPirates of the West Indies\", in the _American Historical Review_, XVI.\r\n529-566.]\r\n\r\nCommission to Captain Butler[2] for the Admiraltie of the Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Nathaniel Butler, third governor of Providence Island,\r\nsent out with a considerable expedition in April, 1638, had earlier\r\nbeen governor of Bermuda and then a member of the royal council for\r\nVirginia.]\r\n\r\nTo all to whome theis presents shall come, we the Governor and Company\r\netc. send greetinge.

Governor Nathaniel Butler, \"Diary of my Present Employment\".\r\nFebruary-March, 1639._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: British Museum, Sloane MSS., 758; pp. 143-173 contain\r\nGov. Nathaniel Butler's \"Diary of my Present Employment\", extracts\r\nfrom the earlier part of which are given here, exhibiting the dealings\r\nof a minor colonial governor with problems of privateering, and\r\nincidentally somewhat of his daily life. The whole journal runs from\r\nFebruary 10, 1639, to May 3, 1640, and is largely occupied with an\r\nunsuccessful privateering voyage in the Caribbean which the governor\r\nundertook on his own account. England was not at war in February,\r\n1639, but war had long existed between Spain and the Netherlands, and\r\nthe depredations carried out from Providence were sure ultimately to\r\nprovoke Spanish reprisals. It was moreover almost an accepted maxim\r\nthat there was \"No peace beyond the Line\", _i.e._, west of the prime\r\nmeridian and south of the Tropic of Cancer.]\r\n\r\n[_February_] 13. Wee hadd an alarme this morneinge, and in regard that\r\nthe sayle that wee made came to an Anchor close without our Rocks\r\ncalled the Breakers, wee sone found that she was a stranger and in\r\nperill: wherupon I sent out two shalopes well manned and followed\r\nmyself in the thirde: and by the waye wee mett with her bote being\r\nonly a Canow in which all of her men wer come off from her and left\r\nher alone; But wee tooke two of her men backe with us to the shypp;\r\nand sent two of my Botes to bring her into the Harbour;[2] the which\r\nwas done: Wee founde her to be a Spanish Frigate, taken by a man of\r\nWarre of Flushinge off of Cuba. she was laden with mantega de\r\nPorco,[3] Hides and tallowe; their resolution was to have carried her\r\nto St. Christophers,[4] and ther to have sold her Goods, but being not\r\nable to fetch itt, she was forced to beare up for our Iland; and but\r\nfor us had wracked upon our rocks; shee was manned with eight men; and\r\nthe man of warre that tooke her haveinge dispatched her as he thought\r\nfor St. Christophers, remained upon the Coast of Hispaniola to looke\r\nout for more purchase:[5] and in the meantime, little knows what is\r\nbecome of his Prize.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The harbor, and the town of New Westminster, were on the\r\nnorthwest side of the island. There is a map in Newton, opp. p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lard.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: St. Christopher's was at this time occupied jointly by\r\nthe English and the French.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In the old sense of prey or plunder.]\r\n\r\n14. I dined at Captain Morgan's. After dinner the Councell of Warre\r\nwer assembled at my house; wher some propositions wer considered off\r\ntouchinge the new come Dutche; as alsoe about some redresses in\r\nrespect of wronngs pretended to be offred by our Pillageinge seamen.\r\n\r\n15. I was att Warwicke Fort[6] this morneinge, wher I called a\r\nCounsell of warre; and the new come in Dutche presented a coppy of\r\ntheir Commission signed by the Prince of Orange and the Dutche West\r\nIndia Company. After dinner being newly returned home, wee hadd an\r\nalarme, upon the discovery of a sayle; and I went presently out in my\r\nshalope and sent Captaine Axe out in his shalope to make a discoverye\r\nupon her; she proved to be another smale man of warre of Holland\r\nwhich had bin long upon the coast of the terra firma;[7] and hadd\r\ngotten nothinge; towards the eveninge she came to an Anchor in our\r\nHarbour. This vessell comeinge to the Ronchadores (it being only a\r\ndesolate barren rocky sande twentie leagues to the eastwards of\r\nProvidence, which is the nearest land unto itt)[8] found ther an\r\nEnglishman the which with some others being in a smale frigate wer\r\nshypwracked upon itt, some of them gott awaye upon two rafts of which\r\nthe one of them was never hearde off; Thoes upon the other raft wer\r\ndriven upon the maine-land of the West-Indies, and soe att last gott\r\nhome. This man with some others remained upon the sande and rocks;\r\nwher att last all of them died save this man only; who after he hadd\r\nremained ther two yeares and a halfe of which for ten monethes space,\r\nafter the deathe of all the rest, he lived solitarily and all alone,\r\nbeing only fedd with such sea foules as resorted to the place, and\r\nsometimes some fish, he was thus taken and brought home unto us in\r\ngood healthe and very lusty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Warwick Fort overlooked the harbor from its north side.\r\nCapt. Samuel Axe, mentioned below, a soldier of the Dutch wars, had\r\nmade the fortifications of the island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Tierra Firma, the Spanish Main, or north coast of South\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Roncador means snorer; the cay is still called by that\r\nname. The story of this man's shipwreck and preservation figures in\r\nIncrease Mather's _Essay for the Recording of Illustrious Providences_\r\n(London, 1684), ch. II. The famous U.S.S. _Kearsarge_ was wrecked on\r\nthe Roncadores in 1894.]\r\n\r\n16. I went very early this mornenige to the greate Baye, wher my\r\nworcks went forwards well and almost to my wish. In the afternoone\r\nbeing returned home, I spent some houres in the hearinge of divers\r\ncontroversies amongst the Inhabitants. Towards night the Commander of\r\nthe Dutche Vessel that came into our Harbour the daye before presented\r\nhimself unto me and shewed me his Commission signed by the Prince of\r\nAurenge:[9] His errand hither was to find and stoppe a leake; haveinge\r\nbin foure or five monethes upon the coast, and gotten noethinge. This\r\nmorneing also, another of the new Companyes was in their Armes, upon\r\nthe great Baye; and exercised by Captain Carter[10] in my presence,\r\nand did well.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Orange.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Capt. Andrew Carter succeeded Butler, as deputy\r\ngovernor, and lost the island to the Spaniards.]\r\n\r\n17. Upon this Lorde's daye I was in the morneinge and eveninge at Mr.\r\nSherrard's Churche,[11] who preached unto us, at both times. After the\r\nafternoone's sermon, the poore man that was soe hapely recovered from\r\nthe Ronchadores, was introduced by Mr. Sherrarde to make a publicke\r\nthanksgiveinge to God for his deliverance with a confession in\r\ngenerall tearmes of his former vicious life, and a promise of future\r\namendment. An act very commendable in itselfe, and a Course fully\r\napprovable: Though itt now brought to every man's minde and\r\nobservation, that whereas the apparent evidence of God's mercye in as\r\nhighe or higher a nature hadd been manifested towards Captain Axe and\r\nhis company in his escape from the enemie, to thoes five persons that\r\ncame safe unto us, in an extreme leakinge bote, from St. Christophers;\r\nAnd towards the fortie nine persons that arrived safely with us from\r\nthe Barbadoes;[12] And all this done within the space of foure\r\nmonethes; that none of all this should have bin remembered by Mr.\r\nSherrard, in the same kinde; as if the safe-being of this one only\r\nman, had either bin of more remarkableness in itselfe, or of more\r\nacceptableness with him than all the others putt togither....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Rev. Hope Sherrard, one of the two ministers of the\r\nisland, and a rigid Puritan, which Governor Butler was not.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Apparently the party led, through remarkable adventures,\r\nby the other minister, Rev. Nicholas Leverton. See Calamy,\r\n_Nonconformists' Memorial_, I. 371.]\r\n\r\n21. Early this morneinge I went out in my shalope to Darlies Fort[13]\r\nto looke out for the vessells that wer made the eveninge before and by\r\nsunne riseinge wee againe made them five leagues out to sea standeinge\r\nin with our Harbour; and by ten of the clocke they came ther to an\r\nAnchor: and one of them proved to be the Pinnace called the _Queene of\r\nBohemia_[14] that I had sent out about five weekes before to looke out\r\nfor Purchase upon the coasts of the maine; the other was a Spanish\r\nFrigate which she hadd made her Prize. I dined this daye at a\r\nweddinge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: At the extreme north point of the island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The queen of Bohemia for whom the pinnace had been named\r\nwas the princess Elizabeth, the ill-fated daughter of James I.]\r\n\r\n22. The Captaine of our last arrived Pinnace came unto me and\r\ncertified me concerneinge his voiage, and the takeinge of his Prize;\r\nand I gave him some Advices about the orderinge of every man's shares:\r\nAnd upon this daye all the montega de Porco, and the Tallow that came\r\nin the first Dutche was sold to the people att reasonable rates....\r\n\r\n25. One of our new Companys was exercised upon this daye, by Captaine\r\nHunt;[15] I went aborde our new prize, to sett downe orders, upon the\r\nBreakeinge of Bulke; And the Prize Goods began this morneinge to be\r\nunshypped, into our Store House. I hadd many Bussinesses brought afore\r\nme this daye, and found trouble ynough in decideinge of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Capt. Robert Hunt, governor 1636-1638, and an\r\nexperienced soldier.]\r\n\r\n26. Our new erected Company of Voluntiers exercised this morneinge,\r\natt our new exerciseinge place, and all the Captaines dined with me:\r\nIn the afternoone, I called a Counsell of warre, where orders wer sett\r\ndowne and given to the Captaines of the Fortes about makeing of all\r\nshotts att the comeinge in of shypps: Witnesses wer also examined in\r\nthe Court of Admiraltie[16] about the new come in Prize, and a\r\npreparation made to an Adjudication. I hearde, determined and appeased\r\ndivers differences, which might have produced ill bloud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The preceding document associates the council of war in\r\nthe governor's exercise of admiralty jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\n27. Very early this morneinge, I found worcke ready for me to heare\r\nand decide divers complaincts between the Inhabitants. Some of the\r\nCounsell of Warre dined with me; presently after dinner I caused a\r\nProclamation pro forma to be made by sound of the Drumme, concerninge\r\nthe Bussinesse of our new gotten prize: viz, That if anyone could make\r\na claime to any of the said Prize goods or saye anything why\r\nadjudication of her being lawfull Prize should not be granted; they\r\nshould come in by such a daye and should be heard accordinge to\r\nJustice. This afternoone all our Prize Goodes being landed, I went to\r\nthe Store-house to see equall divisions made; And the Lordes\r\nfiftes[17] wer first layde aside; and then my dues as Admirall, and\r\nCaptaine Axe's as Vice Admirall; and then some shares wer delivered\r\naccordinge to every man's part, to the common marriner[s]; and all\r\nthe Tobacco belonginge to them, was shared and delivered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Dues to the proprietors, under their patent.]\r\n\r\n28. We wer all this daye busied att the Store-House in the shareinge\r\nof the dues to the Shyp-Company, out of the Prize Goods; and in\r\nproportioninge the Honorable Companye's Fiftes; and mine owne Admirall\r\nduties, and the Vice Admirall's, Captain Axe....\r\n\r\n[March] 2. The Commanders and merchants of the Dutch men of warre\r\ndined with me this daye: our new prize Frigate by the presumption of\r\nher master in takeinge awaye without leave an Anchor and a Cable from\r\nher, which he claimed to be his due, and which she rode by in the\r\nHarbour, was driven ashore; for which fact he was cited to an Admirall\r\nCourt....\r\n\r\n4. I called a Court of Admiraltie this morneinge; and empannelled\r\ntwelve seamen, to deliver their verdict, concerninge a misdeameanour\r\ncommitted by a master of a shyp, in takeinge awaye a Cable and an\r\nAnchor from a vessell rideinge in the Harbour; wherby the said vessell\r\nwas driven on grounds and in perill to be lost: but thes Jurors proved\r\nthemselves soe absurde and ignorant as sone made me finde the miserie\r\nof trialls in these dayes by such kinde of men: And it now produced an\r\nOrder in a session of the Counsell of Warre in the afternoone, whereby\r\nall future crimes and commissions of this nature wer made punishable\r\nanother waye. A new officer in the nature of a fiscall or Advocate[18]\r\nin our Court of Admiraltie was elected and sworne this daye.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Representative of the crown or proprietors.]\r\n\r\n5. The Prize Vessell that was driven aground was gotten off safe this\r\nmorneinge, wherby the penalties inclifted[19] by the verdict in the\r\nAdmiraltie Court in case it hadd perished, wer taken off.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Inflicted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LA GARCE._\r\n\r\n\r\n_3.

The said\r\nBlaeuvelt ran up the Prince's flag above and at the stern, not waiting\r\nfor her, but doing his best to get away from her. About eleven o'clock\r\nat night she came up to him, when Blaeuvelt's quartermaster, named\r\nGerrit Hendricksz, called: \"Flip, Flip, mate Flip\", but received no\r\nanswer and then cried out, \"Strike for the Prince of Orange!\"[4] [The\r\nSpaniard] answered, \"Strike for the King of Spain!\" and immediately\r\nfired with cannon four shots. The fifth piece failed to go off. The\r\nsixth shot struck Blaeuvelt's ship, without his having made any\r\npreparations [to fire]; said Blaeuvelt resolved to sail close to the\r\nwind in order to get to his people.

In 1674, when a state of war existed between France\r\nand the Netherlands, he captured the French forts at Castine and St.\r\nJohn, and took possession of the region as \"New Holland.\" Then, \"at\r\nthe _Bear_ in Boston,\" he gave some sort of commission to another\r\nDutchman or Fleming, Peter Rodrigo or Rodriguez, to John Rhodes of\r\nBoston, and others, under which they proceeded in the piratical manner\r\ndescribed in documents 41 and 42. The Court of Assistants had now, by\r\na law passed in December, 1673, been fully authorized to act as a\r\ncourt of admiralty (which hitherto it had done without formal\r\nauthorization); sitting as such, May 17-June 17, 1675, it condemned\r\nPeter Rodrigo, Dutchman, John Roads, late of Boston, Peter Grant,\r\nScotchman, Richard Fowler and Randolph Judson, Englishmen, for piracy,\r\nand sentenced them to be hanged. All were however pardoned\r\nsubsequently. _Records of Massachusetts Bay_, V. 40, 54, 66.

Court of Assistants sitting in Boston\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Thomas Mitchell of Maulden Fisherman Humbly\r\nsheweth, That the said Mitchell beinge hired in October last both\r\nhimself and the Barque whereof he was a part owner, for three moneths\r\ncertaine and foure uncertaine upon a Tradeing voyage to the Eastward\r\nas farre East as a Plais called Siccanecto[2] in the Bottome of the\r\nBay of Fundi by Captaine Peter Roderius and other of the Privateers,\r\nas by a Charter Party under their hands and seales more att Large it\r\ndoth and may appeare, had nott any thought or suspition that the said\r\nPrivateers would have taken any things from any man wrongfully, they\r\nbefore they went out severall times promiseinge the contrary (which if\r\nthey should deny may be made to appeare). Butt when sd. Privateers\r\ncame to the Eastward, instead of complyinge with their Charter Party\r\nor makeinge good their Promise, forced the sd. Michell to carry them\r\nwhither they Pleased, and although the sd. Michell was very earnest\r\nSeaverall times with them to be discharged from their service,\r\nproffering them at Pemequid,[3] before he went out of this\r\nJurisdiction, to loose the hire of his vessell and with more they\r\ndesired rather [than] to proceed any further in said voyage, as\r\nLieutt. Gardner[4] and his sonnes can testifie, And when he came backe\r\nfrom Pemequid, had he nott, the winde being Faire, been forced away\r\nbefore he could speak with Lieutt. Gardner, he might have had\r\nsufficient testimony from them of his unwillingnesse to proceed any\r\nfurther with them; Neither did the said Michell give his consent to\r\ntheir takeinge of any vessell or goods from any Person but as farr as\r\nin him lay and as much as he durst did oppose the same: Neither had\r\nthe said Michell any share or part of any of the said goods that the\r\naforesd Privateer tooke, nor had any hand in the takeing of either\r\nvessells or goods, butt was alwayes agt. such their proceedings, and\r\nwhen they came as farr East as Naskeague,[5] when the Privateers spake\r\nof goeing over the Bay of Fundi he told them he had rather give them a\r\nHundred Pounds than goe over the Bay with them, as by the Testimony of\r\nRobert Wills may appeare which was sworne by The Worsp'll Mr.\r\nStoughton.[6] Nevertheless they forced the said Michell to goe over\r\nthe Bay with them, tellinge him they would carry him and his vessell\r\nwherever they pleased, And Being at Tuskett Islands,[7] the said\r\nMichell demandinge his hyre, telling them the time was expired that\r\nwas mentioned in the Charter Party, and that he desired to goe home to\r\nlooke after his familie and to pay his Merch'ts that had betrusted\r\nhim, And withall he forewarned them for weighing his Anchors for he\r\nwould stay noe longer in their service; But Richard Fowler,\r\nthreatninge that he would make a hole through his skinne if hee did\r\nnott hold his tongue, went and, whether he would or nott, weighed his\r\nAnchors and forced him to goe backe to Machias; The said Privateers by\r\ntheir uncivill Carriage did make the said Michell soe weary of the\r\nvoyage that if he could have gotten an opportunity he would have come\r\naway with his vessell and left them there, though he had lost all his\r\nhire and what also he carried out with him; Now the Premisses beinge\r\nconsidered by this Hon'ble Court, he hopes they will have soe much\r\nCharitie for him as to conclude him nott guilty of those actions that\r\nare laid to his Charge: The Just and Righteous determinations whereof\r\nhe Leaves to the Wisdome and Clemencie of this Hon'ble Court, and is\r\nbound to subscribe Himself\r\n\r\nYour Honours Most Humble Servt.,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MITCHELL.\r\n\r\nBoston, May the 24th, 1675.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Chignecto, Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Pemaquid, Maine, east of the mouth of the Damariscotta.\r\nThere was an English settlement there from 1626.

Rodregrose\r\ncommanded Thomas Mitchell to Steer right with her, and Comeing up with\r\nher Rodregross bid them Amaine[4] for the Prince of Orainge; whareupon\r\nthey lowred out their Annchor and it proved to be George Manning; then\r\nI the said Youring, haveing heard Rodregross and the Privateers say\r\nwhatt they Intended to doe if they meett with Manning, I intreated\r\nthem not to take him but to lett him goe peaceably with whatt hee had,\r\nand onely give him warning for the future; but Rodregross instead of\r\nComplying with my request blamed me much for speak[ing] against\r\ntakeing of him, and forthwith went on board and tooke a way his\r\npeltery; and the same Afternoone made prize, both of vessell and\r\ngoods, after wh.

And after they had forced Thomas Mitchell and\r\nmyselfe to goe over the Bay of Fundee, as wee Returned backe wee put\r\ninto Maychyas, and Standing into the harbor wee saw a vessell under\r\nDuch collors standing out; which when wee came nere unto proved to be\r\nGeorge Mannings vessell; whoe as soone as hee came up with us, haveing\r\ngotten to Windward of our Vessell, poured a Volley of Shott in upon us\r\nwith Dutch coullors flying, and presently affter wee saw a vessell\r\nwith French Coullors, upon which wee concluded All to be French and\r\nthatt wee ware betrayed and should bee taken; thereupon Capt.\r\nRodregross Commanded every man to his Arms and to fight for his life.\r\nBut as soone as Capt.

The\r\ndocument has a curious interest as showing perhaps the first instance\r\nin which the (Brandenburg-) Prussian navy, or privateer marine,\r\ntouches American history. The Great Elector, Frederick William, had\r\nfor some time cherished ambitious designs, respecting the creation of\r\na navy and the establishment of colonies, but it was not till late in\r\n1680 that he possessed a war-ship of his own, in 1681 that he began a\r\nlittle establishment on the West African coast, in 1682 that he\r\nfounded his African Company. In this year 1679 he had a few ships\r\nhired from a Dutchman, and it appears from this letter of the watchful\r\nFrench minister that two others were being prepared for his service in\r\nZeeland.

The Buccaneers at Portobello. 1680._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: British Museum, Sloane MSS., 2752, fol. 29. This and the\r\nensuing document, both by the same anonymous author, form one\r\ncontinued narrative, of dramatic and astonishing piratical adventure.\r\nFor the second part, the adventures of these buccaneers in the Pacific\r\nOcean, there are other, parallel narratives, some of them longer than\r\nours; but with one exception they say almost nothing of this first\r\nadventure, the capture and sack of Portobello. Two or three pages (pp.\r\n63-65 of part III.) are indeed devoted to it in the chapter on \"Capt.\r\nSharp's voyage\", signed \"W.D.\" [_not_ William Dampier], which was\r\nappended to the second edition of the English translation of\r\nExquemelin's _Bucaniers of America_ (London, 1684), before Basil\r\nRingrose's detailed account of the South Sea adventures was printed\r\nand issued (1685) as the second volume of that celebrated book; but\r\nthe present account is fuller than \"W.D.\"'s, and may apparently be\r\nregarded as the chief source now in print for the history of this\r\nsecond English capture of Portobello. It should be remembered that, by\r\nthe signing of the various treaties of Nymwegen in 1678 and 1679, all\r\nhostilities between European powers had by autumn of the latter year\r\nbeen brought to an end. The privateers who had flourished during the\r\npreceding years of warfare now found their occupation gone--their\r\nlawful occupation at least. Many of them turned to piracy. The writer\r\nof these two narratives speaks of his companions as privateers, but in\r\nreality they had no legal status whatever. When the governor of Panama\r\nasked for their commission, Captain Sawkins replied that \"we would ...\r\nbring our Commissions on the muzzles of our Guns, at which time he\r\nshould read them as plain as the flame of Gunpowder could make them.\"\r\nRingrose, p. 38.

And\r\nlyeing here, wee gott greate acquaintance with the Natives of this\r\nCountry, which the Spaniards had driven over to this side of the Land\r\nfrom the South side; wee found the Indians to have a greate Antipothy\r\nagainst the Spaniards, but could not know to have their revenge. they\r\nunderstanding our designes, they corted us to land and thay would shew\r\nus wheir was Spanish townes Plenty of Silver and golde; of which more\r\nhere-after. The cannoes being gonn to Puerta Vella with about two\r\nhundred and fifty men, left the shipping with a sailing crew a borde\r\nto follow after, wheir orders was given by capt.

Munday night past,\r\nwee heare no newes of our other party that went away out of the other\r\nriver, butt the Indians tolde us by signes that, by such time the sunn\r\nwas att such a High as thay pointed, wee should see the other party.\r\nTuesday Every one takes to his cannoe againe and went downe the river,\r\nand about 10 of the clock we saw an Indian cannoe a setting to us\r\nagainst the streame, alonght the river side, who tolde us that our\r\ncannoes which came downe the other River was gott to the place wheire\r\nboth rivers mett, wheir the Indians intended to meete us. about 2 of\r\nthe clock in the After noone we wear gott downe, and wear very glad to\r\nInjoy the comepany of our owne Peopple againe. in comeing downe the\r\nRiver some cannoes wear over sett; some lost their Armes, butt the\r\nIndians would dive and gett them up againe. one man being left behinde\r\nin the woodes astray, Expecting to Kill something to eate, the Indians\r\nweare soe Kind as to bring him downe to us. thiss afternoone wee fixes\r\nour Armes and cattoch[11] Boxes, Dryes our Poweder. now 20 leagues\r\nfarther wee come to a Place called Santa Maria,[12] to which place wee\r\nrowe and paddle very hard alday. this place made all with Stockados,\r\nno greate gunns, but onely a place to keepe the Indians out of the\r\nriver, itt being a river wheir thay take much golde. about one aclock\r\natt night wee wear gotten close under the Stockadose, soe that wee\r\ncould heare the Centry talke. wee landed about half a mile from the\r\nplace in the woods and lay their till day. Next morning wee heard a\r\ndrum beate. thay fier'd a small arme to discharge their watch, which\r\nhearing no more gunns fired wee knew that wee wear not descryed.

Rich Sawlkings runns to the pallassado's with\r\n2 or 3 men more, and halls up 2 or 3 pallassados by maine strength,\r\nand enters in. thay Imediately calls for Quarter, which was presently\r\ngranted by us. this was one Thirday the 15 day of Aprill. the Governor\r\nwith 2 Negroes and 2 women made his Eschape by runing about a mile\r\ndowne the river, wheir he takes a cannoe and makes for Pennamau downe\r\nthe river so fast as he could, butt understanding he had made his\r\nEschape fitted in the Afternoone a cannoe with six oares. capt.\r\nSawlkings goes in her to see if he could finde this governor butt\r\ncould nott. wee lay att these Stockadose 2 dayes. itt is a very small\r\nplace onely to shelter those that goes to wash golde in another Arme\r\nof the River, which comes out of a river[13] into this Santa Maria\r\nriver. The Injury wee received in takeing the Pallassadoes was that\r\ncapt. Sawlkings was shott in the Head with an arrow, and one man more\r\nshott in the hand, butt both soone cured. wee by Examining Our\r\nPrissonars understoode, that 4 dayes before wee came there went away\r\nfor Pannamau 2 Small Barques which caried away 4 chests of dust golde.\r\nthay had no newes of us before thay saw us. heare we found butt little\r\nRiches. some church plate, as is reported, was found, some dust golde\r\nin callabasses,[14] some wines and brandy, Jerck porke, good store of\r\nbread. the next day wee drawes out to see who would goe for the South\r\nSeas, that is to say to take Pennamau; att last wee findes all our\r\nparty, butt ii which wear unwilling. Our Generall, capt. Coxon, seemed\r\nunwilling, butt with much perswaission went; those ii men that would\r\nreturne, wee putts into their hands to carry that plate wee tooke\r\nheare. thay had Indians to conduct them back. Now wee putts our\r\nselves all in Readiness for Pennamau, which lieth about 30 leagues\r\nfrom thiss Santa Marea river to the Northwards. wee wear 2 dayes a\r\nroweing out of this snta Marea River, before wee gott into the South\r\nSeas. in this place there runns very Stronge tydes of Ebb and floode.\r\nthe tydes keepe their common course as thay doe in the North Sea. itt\r\nflowes by the moone S.S.E. soe wee getting out of the river and the\r\ntyde of floode comeing on, wee rowed hard to gett over to a key which\r\nwee saw,[15] and Stopt their till the floode had done. on which key\r\nwee found the 2 Negro women which had made their Eschape alonge with\r\nthe Governor of the Stockadose. thay tolde us that the gover'r went\r\nfrom thence that morning intending to row alonge shore with the 2\r\nNegro men to Pennamau, he perswaiding him-self that wee would be for\r\nPennamau. wee sent one of our best cannoes to rowe after him, butt to\r\nno purpose. Butt when wee left the Stockadose, the prissnars beggs of\r\nus to carry them away with us, crying that the Indians would distroy\r\nthem all, soe when wee departed that Place wee carried with us what\r\nwee possibly could. no soonar wee came a shore butt wee hears a\r\nmiserable crye. the Indians killed all the poore soules that weare\r\nleft. Now wee being in the South Sea's goes alonge shoare to a Plantan\r\nKey,[16] which lieth about 14 leagues from Pennamau. wee tooke 2\r\nNegroes which was sent thether to cutt woode for building as well as\r\nto breede provissions. Barkques come from Pennamau to fetch itt. this\r\nnight as wee lay here wee saw a Barque on the back side of this key.\r\nwee man'd 2 cannoes and went out and tooke her. she fier'd 2 or 3\r\nsmall Arme's att us butt did not any harme. next morning we went all\r\nout from the key in our cannoes. Our Gen'll capt. Coxon bad all\r\npeopple that wear in small cannoes, to goe on borde the barkque and\r\nputt their cannoes adrift. capt. Batt Sharpe went into the Barkque\r\ncommander, and about 135 men, which had beene in very small cannoes\r\nand fearfull thay might Sinck under them. wee understood by this\r\nbarkque that wee wear nott as yett descried att Pennamau. this day\r\nwee makes sayle, Keepeing the Perriaugers and cannoes company. that\r\nnext night wee saw another Small Barkque which capt.

Butt seeing 6 or 7\r\nsayle of Shipps lying of att the Keys of Perico,[18] which lyeth in 9\r\ndegr. North lattitude and about 2 miles from Pennamau, wheir All the\r\nshipps that come to Pennamau rides, Thay putts for the Shipps, butt\r\nthe Gover'r that had made his Eschape att the Stockadose did nott\r\ndiscry us, butt tolde them Sta. Maria was taken, by what nation he\r\ncould nott well tell butt thought itt weare English. A Barkque wee\r\ngave chase to butt could nott fetch her upp. she seeing all our\r\ncannoes getts into Pennamau and makes alarme. their was by Relacion\r\nputt on board the shipp and Barkques which came out to fight us 300\r\nSoldados[19] and Armed men. wee had about 3 howers dispute and tooke\r\nthem all. wee killed and wounded many men. And Brave vallient capt.\r\nPeter Harriss was shott in his cannoe through both his leggs, bordeing\r\nof a greate shipp. their was nott any gott cleare only on [one] small\r\nBarkque that rann into Pennamau againe. itt being all done and Quiatt,\r\nthe Spanish Gen'll[20] being kill'd wee tooke his Chief captaine, one\r\ncapt. Berralto,[21] who being an Antient Seaman in those seas we\r\ncaused him to be our Pylott, he being the commdr. of that shipp that\r\ncarried away the Riches from Pennamau to Limma about 12 years since,\r\nthat same time when Sr. Henry Morgan tooke Pennamau. this capt.\r\nBerralto was much burnt, and his peopple most of them kill'd and\r\nblowne upp, for as thay fought us thay had scatter'd loose powder on\r\ntheir decks, which tooke a fier by some accident or other, that wee\r\nseeing itt borded them and tooke them. these 7 sayle of shipps we\r\ntooke att Pennamau was not above half unloded. their lading was\r\nflower, linnen and woolen cloath, one greate shipp half laden with\r\nIron. wee desierd of capt.

Our greate shipp heaveing downe very taught, wee could\r\nnot [bring] her keele upp by a streake.[34] itt flowes att this Island\r\ntwo fatham upp and downe.[35] wee made fast our cable to the trees,\r\nand the other Anchor in the offing; all being done to both shipps, in\r\nsix weekes time wee putt to sea againe, intending to windward, and\r\nOrders was given, in case of looseing company, that wee wear to make\r\nthe best of our way for the Island of Plate. att the beginning[36] of\r\nJuly twas, wee putts to sea both together. winds att S.S.E. and S. and\r\nB.E. wee stands with our Star-borde tacks aborde, standing over to the\r\nIsland of Barrakoase or elce called Cock Island.[37] this Isl'd lieth\r\nin under the land, and is inhabbited with 7 or 8 families, as our\r\npilot gave us an account. our former new Barkque, as wee heard, was\r\ntaken into thiss river of barrakoase, and all butt one distroyed. the\r\nland here is high champian land far in the cuntry, butt near the water\r\nside low and Mangrovey. It lieth alonge W.S.W. 90 leagues, till wee\r\ncome up to a key cal'd St. Francisco.[38] wee turn'd in up within 3\r\nleagues of the shoare, with both shipps. wee Indeavord to stand in\r\nwith the land in the night, to gaine the land winde. about the fift\r\nday att night after wee had been outt of the Gorgony, wee fortun'd to\r\nloose company, which brede greate disturbance on borde the Greate\r\nShipp, which had 150 men on borde, butt much more fear and Rangling\r\nwas on borde the _May flower_ for fear wee should all be putt to our\r\nShifts, being in an Enimies cuntry and unknowne Seas to us. wee in the\r\n_May flower_ follows the order received from the Admirall and makes\r\nthe best of our way for the Isle of plate. as itt appeard after-ward\r\nthe greate ship stood into the offing for 2 dayes and the _May flower_\r\nturning alonge shoar, gott to the Isle of Plate before the Ship\r\n_Trinity_ 3 dayes; wee wear about 15 dayes a turning up. the winds\r\nblow att S.E. and b.S. and S.S.E. most Here, with-out itt be in a\r\nturnado. this Isle of Plate is so called because in former time Sr.\r\nFrancis Drake tooke their Armado of shipps, which was bound downe to\r\nPannamau, and carries them into this Island, and their shares their\r\nwealth, as capt. Barralto related to us,[39] so that since the\r\nSpaniards have called itt the Isle of Plate. here wee have good\r\nAnchoring in about 14 fathom water, in a brave Sandy bay. You anchor\r\nagainst the body of the Island, bringing the Sandy bay to bear S.W.\r\nand S. of you. itt is well furnished with gotes, which caused us to\r\ntouch here for fresh meates, butt no fresh water that ships can\r\nconveniently fill att, except in the time of raines. we lay att an\r\nanchor here 3 dayes. one man comeing from the South side of thiss\r\nIsland saw a Shipp off att sea standing into the shore plying to\r\nwindward. itt rejoyced our hearts hopeing to be the _Trinity_ our\r\nAdm'll, which so proved. the next day She gott Inn, which caused Joy\r\non both sides. here wee gott some turtle, which are butt small to\r\nthose in the South Sea's. The greate Shipp was damag'd by standing so\r\nfar to sea outt of the bay of Gorgony, twisting the Heads of her lore\r\nmasts, occasiond by hard winds which blew att S.S.E., butt as soone as\r\nthe carpenters had fitted the heads of the mast wee putt both to sea.\r\nthis Isle of Plate lieth in 58' South lattitude.[40] the Greate shipp\r\nbeing now more in her trim out sails the barkque. now wee learning of\r\na Place cal'd Arico that lieth in south lattd. 18 deg. 40',[41] a rich\r\nplace, Intends thither, But delaying of time att gorgony, advice is\r\nsent from Pennamau up to a towne cal'd Yaceell,[42] a very rich place\r\nfor golde, which befor capt. Sawkins was kill'd intended to have\r\ntooken, butt after the 60 men had left us, wee had Informacion thay\r\nwear provided for us, soe wee stood upp alonge shore to goe to Arica.\r\nin 2 dayes wee getts up as high as St. Alena, which is a point. itt\r\nlieth in south lattd. 3 deg. 5'.[43] the greate ship towes the small one,\r\nbecause would gett to windward before discried. this River of Yseell\r\n[Yaceell] is a brode river, about 35 legs[44] att the mouth. the towne\r\nlieth Near 40 leagues up the River. about the middle of August one\r\nnight, as the greate shipp had us in a towe, we saw a saile in the\r\ndarke. wee lett goe their towe, and made what saile we could to her,\r\ncomes in half a hower up with her, and ha'ls her.

She had about 30\r\nhands in her, fitted out for an Armadillo[45] to come downe to the\r\nIsle of Plate, to see what a posture wee lay in; their was on Borde 2\r\nvery Honorable gentlemen, which came out for ther Pleasure to see us,\r\nwee being term'd amounge them a strainge sort of Peopple and cal'd by\r\nthe name of Laddron. thay tolde us that 4 dayes before thay came out\r\nof Yakell saild a shipp bound up for Lymmo, loden with tymber, woolen\r\ncloth, thred, Stockings and some silks, which if wee kept under the\r\nshoar as shee did wee must needs see her. thiss Vessell wee tooke,\r\nnott sayleing so well as the _Trinity_. wee rummages her, takeing what\r\nwas good, towes her 35 leagues off to sea, cutts her maine mast by the\r\nborde and give her to the Prissnars, giveing them water and flower\r\nenough that thay might not want. wee kept the 2 gent'men and the\r\nmaster to pilote us. wee stood into the river of Yakell and makes the\r\nland. att the south side of the river about 16 leagus within is cape\r\nBlanco which is the southermost point of this river Yacell, and cape\r\nBlanco lieth in 4 deg. South lattd. point a St. Alena is a very remarkable\r\nland to beknowne, for tis like to a shipp with her keele up. thiss\r\ncape blanco is a very barren land, onely small brush growes uppon itt.\r\nthay cals to us out of the greate shipp, aboard the _May flower_, to\r\ngoe in under the shor to anchor, which wee did, and hal'd on borde of\r\nthem. thay tooke out our water and flower and what was necessary and\r\ncutt a hole in her bottom, so wee all went on borde the _Trinity_. by\r\ntakeing a small armadillo barkque, wee have Intelligence that a small\r\nBarkque of 7 hands of our's, one Morriss Connoway commdr., was taken\r\nand 6 of them Kill'd in the river Baracoes, onely one saved which\r\nspeakes good Spannish, which suppose to be one Tho. Hall, whome the\r\nSpaniard hath prissnar att the river Ketto.[46] wee weere sorroy to\r\nhear it but could not help itt, neither knew not how to gett the other\r\noff that was alive, he being about 60 leagues in land. wee cruised\r\nunder the Shoare for the shipp which came out of Yacell bound for\r\nLymmo, which lieth in 12 deg. South Lattd. by our prissnars wee understood\r\nshee had brake her mayne yard and was putt into Payta,[47] butt\r\nstanding to and throw under the Shore wee saw a sayle to windwd. as\r\nfarr as wee could descerne. wee stood after her all night and the next\r\nmorning was within a league of her, the wind blowing a brave fresh\r\ngaile. by 12 aclock was up with her and found her to be the saime\r\nshipp thay tolde us of. wee had all manner of cloth in her, thred,\r\nStocking and a very good linnen and silk plunder, some wine and\r\nbrandy, very little plate, saveing a cupp, dis[h] or plate or soe in\r\nthe cabbon. after wee had Plunderd her what wee would, wee towes her\r\n40 leagues into sea, in the lattd. of 7 deg. 10' So. lattd. wee cutt her\r\nmaine mast and mizan by the borde, and putts in a greate many\r\nPrissnars, keepeing the Master of the Small Armadillo and Barralto for\r\nPylotes. Now wee are all with one conscent bound for Wind-ward,\r\nbloweing a fine ordnary gaile att S.S.E. and S.E. and B.S. wee stands\r\nclose-hald into sea, steming S.W., sometimes S.W. and B.S.; sometimes\r\nthe wind came in flawes, that we lay but S.W. and B.W. wee generally\r\ncounted that wee made west 30 deg. or sometimes 20 deg. degree's course to the\r\nSouthward of the west of cape Blanco, which lieth in 4 degrees. wee\r\nmett with very hard winds, but after wee gott as high as 7 deg. degrees,\r\noppositt to a point of land called Point Agoohow,[48] wee had easey\r\nwinds that wee seldome reeved our topp-sailes. this land trenches away\r\nfrom the Point Agoohow till you come to Arrica, which lieth in the\r\nbottom of all the bay in the lattd. of 18 deg. 40' So. lattd. S.S.E.[49]\r\nwee Stretches of to Sea about a month and getts into the lattd. of\r\nArrica, then wee had att the chainge and fall of the moone a small\r\nw.n.w. wind for 3 or 4 dayes togather. wee stears in E.S.E. with all\r\nsayle wee could, the master att that time Imagining that that course\r\nwould fetch Arrica, butt the wind comeing att S.E. and b.E. and S.E.\r\nwee found that wee could lye but E. and b.N. here wee found 8 deg.\r\nvariacion and as wee runn to the Southward wee found the variation\r\nmore. makeing what saile wee could, being in the lattd. of Arrica 380\r\nlegs., Imagining wee should be discryed before we gott in, wee fell to\r\nleewards of Arrica about 14 leagues, by a bay they call the bay of\r\nYellow.[50] meeting under the Shore with a leward currant, was a week\r\nlonger than expectacion turning up to the bay of Arrica. wee came\r\nabout the beginning of October, and to my best remembrance, Indeavored\r\nto land the Second Day. att the north side of the bay, wee mand our 2\r\ncannoes with 30 men and our Stricking Dory with 8, Our perriauger with\r\n37 men. wee roade to the Shore butt found their no landing, soe that\r\nwee return'd againe, and stood in directly against the Morro Head,[51]\r\nwhich is a High Hill made white with foules dunging on't, which lieth\r\nJust over the towne of Arica, a very Remarkable Place to be knowne.\r\nitt lieth att the wester part of thiss bay of Arica, on which thay ust\r\nto keepe a looke out. Especially now hearing wee wear in the Seas, and\r\nbound upp to take that place, kept the strickter watch. wee saw, that\r\nafter wee had made a second attempt, to goe ashoare, which was the\r\nnight following we made the first, that thay knew of our coming, for\r\nJust as wee wear goeing to land in a bay about 2 leagues to the\r\nSouthwards of the towne, wee saw many horse men rideing alonge Shoare,\r\nso that wee findeing no convenient Place to land, rowed a little of\r\nShoar and consulted togather. wee lay in sight of the shipps, and saw\r\n5 or 6 sayle vaporing and fiering off their Paderrero's[52] to\r\nfrighten us; some of our Peopple would have gon in to have distroyed\r\nthem, and others being backwards would not, soe all returnd aborde of\r\nour man of Warr _Trinity_; and makeing the best of way to windwards.\r\nCapt. Batt. Sharpe being our commandr., and haveing gott money by the\r\ndeath of our former capt. Sawkens, and more that he gott by Play, was\r\nIntended thiss year through the streights of Majelena,[53] butt some\r\ngrumbled saying thay had not Voyage Enough, and weare unwilling, so\r\nthat their was a debate amounge the peopple and capt[ain], butt\r\nstretching of itt into 29 deg. and 30' wee weare Informed of a towne in\r\nthiss lattd. its called Quoquemba,[54] a towne of 7 churches, no longe\r\nsettlement butt a mighty Pleasant place and very rich of gold and\r\nsilver. A Delightsome garden for all sorts of fruite, a[s] cherries,\r\nAppricocks, Peaches, Apples, pares, prunellos, Strawberrys and all\r\nthings which grow in our Northern Parts, and curious small runing\r\nRiver parting Every mans land, mighty Pleasant to beholde. thiss towne\r\nof Quoquemba wee takes, butt wear discried 3 dayes, as wee heard\r\nAfterwards, By a flagg of truce which came in to treate with us. thay\r\ngotten away their mony and Plate out of the towne, onely some Church\r\nPlate with Silk hangings we Plundred. in the towne we tooke fresh\r\nProvission, as biefes, hoggs, and wine, which is made hear, And\r\nindifferent good Brandy wee carried on boarde. wee landed here on a\r\nTuesday Morning, an houer before day, att a store-house which is made\r\natt the S.S. west part of the bay, from whence capt. Batt Sharpe and\r\nrest of the party (onely[55] those who wear left in the cannoes and\r\nLaunch which was 2 in the cannoes, and 3 in the launch) marched for\r\nthe towne of Quoquembo. 35 of our party as they wear Marching mett\r\nabout 150 Spaniards, most on horseback; thay had not all gunns, some\r\nlaunces, other Spade's; more of our Party comeing upp, seeing the\r\nfoloorne so much Ingaged, thay wounded one or 2 of their horses, with\r\nsome of the Spaniards, which made them to retreat to a greate hill,\r\nabout 5 mile from the towne. wee Entred the towne and kept possession\r\nof 4 dayes. wee askt the flagg of truce five hundred thousand peeces\r\nof Eight for the randsome of thiss towne, and told him that the next\r\nday by 10 of the clock, thay should bringe their money, otherwise wee\r\nwould burne the towne. the next day the flagg of Truce came downe by\r\n12 of the clock, and tolde us thay would give no randsome. wee\r\nunderstood thiss flagg of truce Had a suit of law in hand, and was\r\nlikely to be cast, as he afterwards told us, which would be the ruing\r\nof him-self. he shew'd us his house and desier'd us to sett fier on\r\nitt, whatever wee did. fa[r]ther told us that if we weare not gone the\r\nnext day thatt thay had gotten togather 600 men and most of them\r\nArmed. wee gett the Plunder of the towne what wee could. Next morning,\r\nsetts most part of the towne on fier and Martches to the bay. their\r\nour cannoes mett us and tooke in our things wee brought downe and\r\ncarried on borde the shipp, wheir she lay att Anchor within a Mile of\r\nthe Stoare house, Just within a Rockey Poynt. the land lay in the\r\nwinde 2 Points without her. the night before our Party came downe, Our\r\nShipp had likt to have beene burnt. A Hogg skyn being blown upp and\r\nsowed tyte, some fellow of a Spaniard had Venterd off and laid itt on\r\nthe rudther and Stearn Post (itt stufft with powder), satt itt on\r\nfier, and went away unseene by our Peopple. some of our men smelling a\r\nstrainge Smell, run to and thro' about the Shipp to see for itt,\r\nlookeing every wheir. One man, seeing a light come into the Cabban,\r\nlookes out att the Stern-Portes, and spies wheir itt was, cryes out\r\nfor more help, and by a providenc of God gott itt speedily out. some\r\nImagined itt to be a Plott of the Prissnars aborde against us. some\r\nwear for killing capt. Barralto, because att that time he hid himself,\r\nothers for keepeing him alive till our capt. and party came on board,\r\nwhich the next day thay all did, and being acquanted with what was\r\npast concludes to sett them on shore here thatt wee had had 7 or 8\r\nmonths, Don Juan and his Cossin, a fine younge man, capt. Juan and\r\ncapt. Barralto wee putt ashore, all att thiss storehouse in the bay of\r\nQuoquemba. wee wear glad to be ridd of them butt thay much more glad\r\nto be cleare of us; butt before thay went ashore thay understoode that\r\nwee wear minded to goe to two keys that lieth from thiss Place S. and\r\nb.W. and S.S.W. about 90 leagues off shoare in the lattd. of 33 deg. 45'\r\nsouth lattd. These keys are called Don Juan Francisco's[56] keys,\r\nbecause he found them out first, and Putt a parcell of goates on them,\r\nand since have bredd to a mighty number. aboundance of Fish and\r\nSeales; as fine keys as any in these seas to recruite att, being water\r\nand wood Enough. all is on the Easterd most key. these keys lieth East\r\nand west one of the other, 20 leagues distance by Relacion of some\r\nPrissnars.[57] on the westermost key is no anchoring for Shipps\r\nneither any cattle, so that wee did nott stop their att all, but went\r\nto the Estermost key, wheir wee come to anchor, with a northerly\r\nwinde. att the South sid of thiss Island is a brave Sandy bay but no\r\nrideing if the wind come out Southerly; then you may runn downe to the\r\nleeward side of the Island. Our master, Jno. Hilliard, for some\r\nmisdemeanor was turn'd out of his Place, and his mate, one Jno. Hall,\r\nputt in Master. Hall went with a cannoe mand to Leeward to find a bay\r\nwhich he thought might have beene a good place, seeing no better, so\r\nwee ridd 2 dayes with the Shipp at the Southermost bay. the wind\r\ncoming out againe att S.E. and b.S. and S.S.E., we waied and putt to\r\nsea, fearing twould blow hard, itt being an open bay. so wee rann\r\ndowne to thiss other bay our new master had found out, and lett goe\r\nanchor. our cable parted. wee weire faine to goe father to looke for\r\nanother anchor Place, and about 4 miles to the N.W. we saw a fine\r\nlarge bay and rivers of water, that wee filled our water close to the\r\nwater sid, wooding convenient, fish great store, Seals Inumerable,\r\nbutt we eate none, gotes mighty Plenty. the Islands are butt small,\r\nnott above 7 miles round, butt very high and Hilly, full of Valleys,\r\nso that wee rowed on the westward sid of the Island to windward or to\r\nthe southward to hunt for goates. In thiss second bay of anchorag,\r\ncame downe such flawes of wind out of the Valleys that our Anchor\r\ncould nott hold, that wee almost drove aShore. our Peopple cutting\r\nwood and filling water, which was the greater Party, haveing no love\r\nfor capt. Batt. Sharpe, concludeing togather to turne him out of his\r\ncapt'shipp, which thay did, and Putts into his Place a stout rugged\r\nfore man as captaine;[58] itt was much trouble to capt. Sharpe to be\r\nthuss served, butt could nott help himself, for the peopple weir\r\nResolved nott to goe home by Sea before thay had more money. wee lay\r\nin thiss small bay, which was about 2 miles to leeward of thiss greate\r\nbay, about 3 dayes. wee made hast and gott our Anchor we lost and\r\nwater aborde, and the most part of the wood wee had cutt. wee wear\r\nminded to have spent a moneths time att thiss key of Juan Fernandus\r\nand then to have gon downe to have cruised till the next Year; Our\r\nBlacksmith was ashore prepareing to have built a forge, and made Iron\r\nworke for the Shipp, and Intended to have burnt charcole. he had\r\npartly fixed his bellose. wee had two men of warr cannoes gon to\r\nwindward for goates and had found, by relacion, 150 fatt ones, butt\r\nsleepeing alnight by a fier att the Sea Side and in the morning went\r\nto fetch their goates, lookeing out to se if the Sea weir cleare of\r\nshipps Spyed within 3 leagues of the Island 3 greate saile of Shipps,\r\nAdmirall, Vise Adm'll and Rear Adm'll; seeing thiss, made what hast\r\nthey could to their cannoes and soe on borde shipp, leaveing all their\r\ngoates behind them bound. as soone as thay came near the Shipp thay\r\nwarned us with 3 Motions, that wee understoode their was 3 saile. wee\r\ngott all our peopple that weir on shore off and what other things wee\r\ncould, gott our anchor on bord, had nott time to gett the Other butt\r\nlett him slipp, hoysted in Our launch and canno's. by thiss time thay\r\nweir came within sight of us; so near that wee could se a weapon\r\nflorrished on the quarter deck of the Adm'll. wee understoode wee had\r\nleft one of our Strikears on shore that had gott under a tree to\r\nSleepe, sent a cannoe for him but could not finde him, soe came of to\r\nthe Shipp and left him their.[59] these 3 shipps Clings the wind and\r\nstands After us. the reare Adm'll which was the least had 12 gunns,\r\ntheir Vise Adm'll 16 and their Adm'll 24. Our new capt., being Jno.\r\nWatkins, would have gon aborde the Adm'll if the Party had beene\r\nwilling; wee could wronge them by sayling att our Pleasures, bye or\r\nlarge, soe that wee played with them a day and a night. then wee\r\nconcluded twas our time to goe downe and take Arrica, the Place that\r\nwee made an attempt att before. wee made what sayle wee could,\r\nSteering N.E. and b.N., to fall in about 30 leagues to windward of\r\nArrica, which wee did very well, but we weir tolde of a fishing key\r\nthat lay hear abouts 18 leagues from Arrica;[60] wee concluded to go\r\nthither, which was our greate folly, and so standing off and on, those\r\non the key saw us and forthwith sent to Arica to informe them of us.\r\nOur man of warr cannoes, roweing alonge shore to thiss Key, was 2\r\ndayes before came up with itt, which att last did, and took 2 Antient\r\nmen Prissnors, about 75 years of Age. here we gott some fish and wine.\r\nour peopple Examin'd the 2 old men, found them in two tailes, the one\r\nbeing trew, the other not, as wee found Afterwards. the one tolde us\r\nthat Arica had news of us and that he believ'd thay would be provided\r\nfor us; for he sd. a Post would ride from the sand key to Arica in 3\r\ndayes. for thiss Speech the man was shott downe by our quarter master\r\nJno. Duill. the Other was made much of, because was supposed to speake\r\nthe truth. soe wee made what hast wee could to Arica, and on a sunday\r\nMorning, itt being in March, wee landed 82 men, wee understanding itt\r\nto be a small towne. our orders was, if wee saw 3 Smokes rise from the\r\nhill thay called the More, wee should make what hast wee could into\r\nthe harbor. Our Peopple marching till thay came to the towne, saw no\r\npeopple till they Entred the townes End, wheir thay found Every topp\r\nof a house fitted for them, and a fort of 12 gunns mounted. their\r\nhouses hear are built all flatt att the topp, for they never have any\r\nRaines, no, nott in the remembrance of the Spaniards, butt very greate\r\ndewes. Wee fell on the towne smartly, and became Victors in fouer\r\nhowers time so that twas our owne, Notwithstanding their was above 700\r\nmen In Armes, att our comeing.[61] all the Cuntry within 20 myles was\r\ncome inn and more in greate Number comeing. wee tooke the biggest\r\nchurch to Make a Hospitall for our wounded men, which weare about\r\ntenn, and six killd out right. Our capt. Jno. Wattkings was kill'd att\r\nthe same time, to our discomforts. One of the capt. of the Spaniards\r\nwhich wee had taken, Spake in his owne linqua[62] to thiss Efect,\r\n\"Gent men, I know you are men come to seeke a fortune, if You want\r\nmoney or Plate goe alonge with me, I will shew you wheir their is more\r\nthen you all can carry away.\" wee gave no credit to him, butt was\r\nminded to fall on uppon the forte to take their greate gunns for the\r\nshipp, haveing none on board. Our Party being so tired, and cutt off,\r\nwee weare feigne to leave the greate gunns, money, all the Rest of the\r\nrich traide which was in that small towne. three of our Doctors being\r\nin the Hospitall Church dressing of our wounded men, had about 6 men\r\nOrder'd to guard them with their Armes. after wee saw we weir so\r\nworsted and beaten, fighting against so greate Advantage, Some\r\npeopple rann to bid them come away as could march, for our Party was\r\ngon out of the towne. the Spaniards seeing thiss gott fresh to their\r\nArmes againe, and rallied upp with us about the church that they durst\r\nno come out, so that their was left 5 well men besides the 3 Doctors\r\nwhich had not one Dropp of blood spilt from them. one or two of the\r\nwounded men that had good hearts gott up and rann to the Party, and\r\ntho' thay had many a shott made by the Spaniards att them, yett Scapte\r\nclear. so many of our Party being almost choked for water, made use of\r\ntheir owne; butt comeing downe to the water side wheir the launch and\r\ncannnoe lay reddy to receive them, their follows them a parcell of\r\nNegro's and Mallattos, which stood on a High Hill Just over the\r\nCannoes and throwes Downe Stones and Launces on Our Peopple. In thiss\r\nfrey, wee had taken, kill'd and wounded about 30. Wee Judge wee could\r\nnot Distroy of them less then 150 or 200 men, for they lay very thick\r\nin the Streetes. Their governor or Gen'll was upon a Hill calld the\r\nMore, on Horse back, Just over the towne, from whence he could see\r\ninto every Streate and which way wee went. he often weaved to his\r\nsoldiers from thence, With his Handkerchiffe, to gave them notice\r\nwhich way wee went, and crying out, \"Valiente soldados, buina Valienta\r\nSoldados.\"[63] Some of our peopple passed a shott att him but could\r\nnot have the fortune to hitt him. Our former new capt., Jno.\r\nWattkings, being kill'd att this Place, capt. Sharpe would have thrust\r\nhimself capt. againe. Soe that our party resolved to goe downe to\r\nleeward. The most voyces wear to have the shipp, the lessar to have\r\nthe Launch and two cannoes. One party was resolved to stay, the other\r\nto goe over Land, as will be presently related. wee now wanting water\r\nand soe like to be in greate Distress, considered, and with the advise\r\nof our Spanish pilott wee must goe into Ylo[64] for water, butt wee\r\nlearneing by some Spanish Journalls that their was water 14 Leagues to\r\nwindward of Ylio, which place wee Indeavord to comepass, and comeing\r\nthither, found such a sea goeing as could nott gett ashoar with our\r\nCannoe; Soe Endeavor'd to gaine the Keys of Juan Fernandas againe. But\r\nthe windes bloweing so much southerly we could nott. soe leaveing itt\r\ninto the Shoare with our Starboard tacks on board, fetcht the bay\r\nthe[y] call't Vispo, in which their is a brave River and very good\r\nwater, which bay lieth in South lattd. 29 deg..[65] So wee fill their\r\nabout six tunn of water, And by Informacion of a Prissnor their taken,\r\nthat att Coequembo lay 2 men of warr, and he beleived would be downe\r\nnext morneing, thiss bay of Vispo being butt 15 leagues N. and b.W.\r\nfrom Coquembo. att thiss Place wee found a new barkque and building.\r\nsome sheepe and goates wee brought of for foode, butt the Barkque wee\r\nleft, hopeing to have better of her hereafter. Putting out of this\r\nPorte wee saild alonge N.N.W. 3 dayes, about 8 leagues of Shoare, to\r\nanother bay lying about 24 degrees South lattd, A Bay cal'd by the\r\nname of Capt. Drakes his bay, Because that when he was their he\r\nwater'd. their is a brave fresh water River, And to thiss day is\r\nstanding a church which the sd. cap. Drakes causd to be Built for his\r\nMemoriall; alltho' wee could nott gett on shoare by the Violence of\r\nthe Suff, yett the church was very vissible to us, nott being above\r\none quarter of a mile from itt.[66] so that att last wee wear forc't\r\nto goe to Ylo to fill our Bumkings[67] with water. wee stay'd hear two\r\nDayes but dare make no longer stay, for fear the cuntry should come\r\ndowne uppon us. This Ylo lieth N.W. and b.W. from the Afore named\r\nArica, above 26 leges, And in the lattd. of 17 deg. 45' South lattitude.\r\nYlo beareth from the Citty lymmo S.B.E. 120 legs. now haveing fill'd\r\nthiss water we putts to sayle to carry the party which was minded to\r\nMartch back into the North Seas. wee rann down alonge, N.W. and by N.\r\nand N.W., Just keepeing sight of land because would not be Descried,\r\nwhich way wee went. About 9 dayes wee saild N.W. and b.N. and N.W.,\r\nand meeting with a Strong Currant which as wee Judged Satt N.E. into a\r\nbay, wee fell in with a small Island about five Miles round, in the\r\nlattd. of 7 deg. 40' So. and about 12 leagues off the Maine shoare. to\r\nthiss Island our Prissnars tolde us severall Barkques came to for\r\npretious Stones, which weir to be found their. Due East from thiss key\r\nlieth Another which is Inhabbited, 7 leagues from thiss key and 5\r\nleagues from the maine or Trucksilly,[68] which is a towne wheir is\r\nwater, and on thiss key cattle; aboundance of Fish is made here. Wee\r\nJust weatherd the small Rockey key on which the Pretious Stones are\r\nfounde; wee had the wind att S. and B.E. and S.S.E., a fine topp saile\r\ngaile and fair weather. wee Steares away N. and b.E. to make Point\r\nSta. Alena, the Point that is before discourst of, that makes the\r\nNorthermost Point of the River Yakeell. the next day was upp with the\r\nIsle of Plate, which lieth in South lattd. about 50'. then the Party\r\nthatt resolved to goe over land, began to provide for Vittuall. their\r\nwas about 56 of them, which carried away what thay had. thay had a\r\nlaunch and two cannoes. itt was on Sunday, after wee had din'd with\r\nwhat wee had, which was att that time onely bread and water. and now\r\nbeing under the Equinoctiall about a ii leagues from Shore wee [saw]\r\nMount a Christo plaine,[69] that lieth some leagues in the cuntry, The\r\nMount bore of us E.S.E. these poore men when parted from us had about\r\n5 leagues to goe, before could Conveniently Land, for wild Indians and\r\nnegro's, which by shipping formerly their was cast away, and since\r\ngrone very Populus and Barberous, As we wear inform'd by our\r\nPrissnors. thay did intend to take thiss island of ---- or Cork\r\nIsland, which lieth in the bay of the Gorgony. now thay being gon both\r\nparties wear much troubled att the parting, Yett the party that went\r\naway would have staied in case Sharpe had nott beene made capt., for\r\nthay could not by any meanes allow of him to be capt. more of us would\r\nhave gon away, Butt capt. Sharpe sends his Master to us who spoke\r\nthuss (his Name was Jno. Cooxe), \"Gentmen, capt. Sharpe doth declair\r\nand swair that those men that will stay with him and goe about in the\r\nshipp with him by water, that he will make them a Voyage, and doe the\r\nuttmost of his power to gett money Enough, and will not have thoughts\r\nof goeing out of these till every man is willing.\" soe wee consider'd\r\nour shipp was foule. wee that stayed wear about 61 soles in number.\r\nwith the advise of capt. Batt. Sharpe was resolved to run downe to\r\nPennamau, and to leeward, to finde some private place to cleane our\r\nshipp in, and to take her one deck lower. wee searching of some\r\nSpanish Jurnalls findds mention of an Island lieing to the No'ward in\r\n8 degrees called the Island of canes, wheir wee found thiss Isle of\r\nCanes;[70] and by our observacion lieth in North lattitude, 7 deg. 30'.\r\ntheir is good wooding and watering butt no secure place for a shipp to\r\nride in, without very good Anchors and Cables, which wee att that time\r\nwas Ill provided with. wee staied here 3 dayes and killed one sow and\r\nPigg and fill'd water. here are good large Oysters. so wee sett saile\r\nwith full intencion to goe into the Gulph of Dulce,[71] if wee could\r\nfind itt, but wee stearing away N.W. about 33 English legs from thiss\r\nIsle of Canes, which Island lieth 5 legs from the Maine shore, and\r\ncomeing in with the land saw a brave deepe gulph, which concluded was\r\na good Place for us to cleane Our shipp, hopeing that their might be\r\nno Inhabitance. Into which gulph we rann, by sounding of our leade so\r\nfarr as wee could, Except wee had had a Pilott for that place. wee\r\nhoyst our 2 men of warr cannoes And went upp the Gulph. capt. Batt.\r\nSharpe Imbarkque[d] in one of them him self, to see if could take an\r\nIndian to understand whatt for a place itt was; goeing about 4 leagues\r\nahead of the shipp, comes upp with an Island lying in the gulph of\r\nNicoy,[72] which Island wee understood by some Indians was called the\r\nIsland of Perroz or in English the Isle of doggs. wee found 3 or 4\r\nfamilies which lived heare of Indians, very poore, haveing all thay\r\ngett once in two years taken from them by the fryars, and thay tell us\r\nthat if thay have nott to pay the friars what their demands is when\r\nthay come, that thay carry away their children and makes them Slaves.\r\nButt our capt. Batt. Sharpe Asked of one Indian that could speak\r\nSpanish, if any Shipp used to come their. he said that their was att\r\npressent 2 small Barkques that weir come from Pennamau, which weir\r\nlodeing with hides and tallow bound for Pennamau again. The Indian\r\ntolde the capt. he would Shew us wheir they weir; with whome capt.\r\nSharpe went with his cannoe well man'd, thiss Indian leaveing some\r\nhands on the Isle of Perros or Dogges, to see that none gott away to\r\ndiscry us, with our Shipp getts on brest the Island and Comes to an\r\nAnchor, and missing the right channel lay their not haveing above 3\r\nfoote water more then wee drew. thiss was about 25 of Aprile 1681. the\r\nnext morning these two barkes was taken, the one being 2 thirds loden\r\nand the other half loden with talloe; wee tooke out as much as wee\r\nthought might serve to tallow our Shipps bottom twice and to make us\r\ncandles, and no more, which is as I Imagin about 60 or 70 Packs. Now\r\nwee wanting carpenters understoode by thiss Indian Pylott that their\r\nwas 2 shipps up an Arme of a River, about 4 leagues from thiss Isle of\r\nDogges. The Indian conveighs us the next night upp to them. the\r\nmorning about an hower before day wee comes wheir thay weir building,\r\nabout 300 tunns a Peice; one of them haveing beene on the Stocks about\r\n3 years. itt Pleas'd god wee tooke the head carpenter and the Rest of\r\nhis gange, which weir about 12 in Number, with their tooles, about 6\r\nJarrs of wine and Brandy, which was much to our comfort, haveing lived\r\nfor some time before on bread and water. takeing these carpenter[s]\r\nwith their tooles, wee weare in greate hopes to have Our Shipps upper\r\ndeck taken downe and made better for sayleing in little time, with\r\nthe help of our owne carpenters; butt to carreene her here is\r\nimpossible Because of a greate citty about 18 leagues from thiss\r\nlagoone of Nicoy, itt being the citty Naine,[73] wheir thay can Raise\r\n20000 Men. wee fell lower downe in the River, as lay out of the way of\r\nthe tide as much as could, for here the tides runn very Stronge and\r\nkeepes itts course of moone. itt flows S.S.W., which when the moone\r\ncomes to thiss S.S.W. point itt makes high water. itt flowes about 3\r\nfathom and half right upp and downe. when wee brought these Spanish\r\ncarpenters on borde, our capt. and carpenter Shewed the Spannish\r\ncarpenter what thay would have done, desiering him to be reall, and\r\ntell them in what time itt might be finished. he promis'd that within\r\n10 day, with the assistance of our peopple, he did nott doubt butt\r\nfinnish itt; att which our capt. and company told him that as soone as\r\nhe had done he should have one of the barques for his paines, and all\r\nhe[r] ladeing of tallow, and that he would sett them all ashore\r\nagaine. thiss Spannish carpenter being a very Ingenious worke man, and\r\nsaw wee shew him and his company a greate deale of respect, which\r\nbegott a love in him to us, for he tolde us wee should make what\r\ndispatch wee could out of the lagoone, for the cuntry was very\r\npopulus, and would soone be after us if could procure any Imbarcation.\r\nthe carpenter dispatcht is [his] buisness in 12 days, so that he and\r\nhis comepany had the Barkque and all her loding. putting them ashore\r\nwith some Prissnors wee had taken before, wee take a perriauger that\r\ncome downe to thiss Isle of dogges, with a Spannish March't and a\r\nMustees woman, which we suppose he kept. the woman lieing on borde one\r\nor two nights, was very familiar with one Copas a dutch a man,[74] who\r\nformerly had saild with the Spaniards, and had the linqua att will,\r\nbut was mainly Inamoured with thiss women, makeing her severall\r\npresents of some Vallew. after the carpenters weir gone wee fell downe\r\nlower in the lagoone to fill water. thiss Copas goeing aShore to guard\r\nthe Prissnars that fill'd water made an Excuse to goe into the woods\r\nto kill some thing to eate, but went cleare away, that wee never saw\r\nhim since, carrying with him about 200 Peices of Eight in golde and\r\nSilver, that putt us in feare least he would give Intelligence which\r\nway wee weir bounden, wee being att this time butt a small partie,\r\nabout 64 soules, and nott any greate gunn to help us. in takeing of\r\nthese carpenters one of our men, a Scotch man, haveing dranck to much,\r\nby some way or Other gott out of the cannoe and was drounded. the\r\npeopple telling us the Barkque saild primely well and the best saylor\r\nbelonged to Pennamau wee kept her to waite on the Shipp. shee was a\r\nsmall open barkque. wee tooke in her a man that was acquainted with\r\nthiss Gulph of Dolce, who tolde us wee might lay the shipp on shore\r\ntheir very well and no body see us, nor any Spaniard know we weir\r\ntheir, so wee concluded to go. about May the first 81, wee arrived in\r\nthis Gulph of Dulce. itt lieth from the lagoone of Nicoy about 47\r\nleagues South and from the Island of canes ii leagues S.S.E. wee found\r\naccording to what the Spanish fellow tolde us, a very fine place to\r\nhall our Shipp on shore to cleane her. Here we caught some fish and\r\nturtle and fedd well for the time wee lay here. we Built a house\r\nashore to putt our provissions in, to keepe them from the Raines, and\r\ncarried ashore the most part of our Ballast, in the barkque and men of\r\nwar cannoes. wee findeing the small barque to Saile very well, the\r\nCapt. putt in 7 Hands to her, to sayle her. as wee lay one night ready\r\nto hall a shore the next high water, the winde blew att South very\r\nhard, that our after mast cable gave way, that the shipp drave ashore\r\nagainst the rocks, we weir afraid should have bildged her; but the 2\r\ncarpenters, being carefull, shord her up to ease her what thay could,\r\nand the next flood heav'd her off againe to a sandy place in the bay,\r\nwheir wee found some butt heads started and abundance of nailes and\r\nspikes wanting, which our carpenters had provided for and drave\r\naboundance in her bottom. we lay here about 5 weekes, mending our\r\nsailes and fixing our rigging. here cam in to us some Indian men,\r\nwomen and children, to whome wee gave Victualls and drink; thay staid\r\nwith us tell we had done our shipp; some times giveing us plantans,\r\nand some time goeing into the woods, finding bees nests, would give us\r\nthe Honney; butt the most good these Indians did us, wee had their\r\nbarque loggs[75] all the time we lay hear to make us a Staige. Some of\r\nthem goeing away Amounge the Spaniards tolde them that their was a\r\ngreate Shipp in the Gulph, and that wee weir a casting of greate\r\ngunns. Butt these Indians that came to us tolde us that the Spaniards\r\nhad tolde them if any shipps came in that had any thing of redd in\r\ntheir collers,[76] that thay should have a caire and not come on borde\r\nof them nor lett us see them, telling them that wee would kill them;\r\nbut as itt happen'd we went in with all white collers, which was the\r\nSpanish order that thay should Assist all those, for thay weir their\r\nfriends and would doe them no harme. the Spaniard lives here from the\r\nGulph of Dulcey about 3 dayes Journey. thiss Gulph lieth in lattd. 7 deg.\r\n22' No. lattd. wee fitted our Shipp, clensed our bottom what wee\r\ncould; the small barque filld water, cutt wood, and went away to Sea\r\nto looke for Purchase.[77] we went from thiss place about the last of\r\nJune 81, haveing a good fresh gaile att S. and B.E. and S.S.E. wee\r\nstands over thiss bay, cald the bay of the Gorgony, which Isle of\r\nGorgoney wee carreend att the last Year lieth in No. lattd. 3 deg. 35', or\r\ntheir abouts. the land that we made was 7 leagues farther to windward.\r\nhere generally setts a greate currant out of the Sea into thiss bay\r\nE.N.E. wee fell in first with Barraco Island and cock Island. wee now\r\nbethinks our selves that twas time in the year to gett up to windward\r\nto goe through the streights of Magelene. wee recruted here with\r\nwater, filling all we could. about 30 leagues W.S.W. from thiss Island\r\nBarricoes we turnes up to windwards, and of[f] Cape passagoe, which\r\nlieth in 45' No. lattd.,[78] wee cruises a good way of shore, about\r\n16 or 18 leagues, sees a saile, we gave chase, and comes up with her\r\nabout 9 aclock of night. we found her to come out of Yakell, bound for\r\nPennamau. the same shipp wee took loden with cloth and other goods the\r\nLaste year, which was then bound upp to Lymmo. she had in her now good\r\nStore of cloth, silk, stockings, mony and Plate, about forty thousand\r\npeices of Eight, and severall good things, butt the chiefest of her\r\nlading was coco. wee tooke out her what we thought convenient and\r\ncarried her under the shore and came to an Anchor, and when we had\r\ndone rummageing her putt them all aborde, cutt downe their maine mast,\r\ngave them Victualls and Drinck enough, and putt them to sea to goe\r\nright afore the wind for Pennamau. the master was very glad we gave\r\nhim his shipp againe, and the most part of his lodeing; that he swore\r\nwee wear the Honnestest ladrones that ever he saw in his daies. we\r\nwent of to sea cruiseing for more. we understood by thiss last prise\r\nthat the Spaniards could not tell if [we] wear to windward or\r\nleewards. 3 dayes after in the morning we spies a small barque close\r\nby shore. wee gave chaces to her, came up hand over hand with her. She\r\nmakes what she could for the Shore, their being one Spaniard in her\r\nthat knew us, who we had taken the last year.

Sharpe, with\r\nabout 36 hands, went to land att Payta, butt found itt so well lyned\r\nwith men that thay durst not adventure On itt, but come back againe,\r\nresolveing to live on bread and water till such time as could be\r\nbetter supplied, concludeing that our wine and brandy would keepe us\r\nalive. wee now makes no more tacks alonge shore, but stands close\r\nhal'd on a boleing to sea,[82] about 670 leagues due West from Payta,\r\ntill we come up to 33 So. lattd. ther we had variable winds. wee hal's\r\nin for the shore, getting our Larbord tacks on borde, the wind comeing\r\nout at N.W. in that quarter that wee could not fetch the Keys of Juan\r\nFernandus, wheir wee Expected to Recruit with fresh goates and water,\r\nand to have faught[83] off our Musketa-Indian we left their the time\r\nbefore, but we getting to the Southwards of these keys, and the winds\r\ncomeing out for Northerly, was forced to ply to the Southward, and\r\nthen wee had Some raines, which from 7 deg. So. lattd. till you come to\r\n28 deg. So. lattd., is never no raine by the Spaniards report nor since\r\nthay have inhabited the cuntry, which hath been about 180 years; yett\r\nvery good Corne growes, and all sorts of Herbs and graine, but thay\r\n[have] Extreeme dues. wee stands still to the Southward, and haveing\r\nnow great variation, 13 or 14 degrees, we wear very Exact in takeing\r\nAmplitudes,[84] to be the more Sattisfied in thick weather of our true\r\ncourse made. wee stood to the S.E. and S.E. and B.S. 700 leagues, and\r\nabout 3 aclock in the Morning the watch saw breakers very near us\r\nunder our Lea. it blew hard, that 2 nights before we had handed[85]\r\nour topp sailes, and went under a pair of Coarses and our mizon. wee\r\nwear gott now up to 50 deg. 8' So. lattd. itt being a little light, before\r\nday wee saw the land plaine. wee heaved out our topp sailes reeved and\r\nmade shift to weather all the breakers, and when twas day we discried\r\na place between 2 keys which we concludes to beare up to see if wee\r\ncould finde any good Anchoring and saife rideing till twas a little\r\nlater in the year. twas very colde heare, much raine, The Hills coverd\r\nwith Snow. wee went in along the key side about 4 leagues and saw a\r\nvery convenient cove. wee came to an Anchor the 3d of November,\r\nthinking to stay hear till the weather was a little warmer. the first\r\nnight we lost one Anchor, the Cable being Very bad. we warped and\r\ntowed into another Cove, lieing a little more to the Southwards, the\r\nwind blowing N.N.W. wee gott the ends of all our cable and Hassers and\r\nmade fast ashore to the trees; yett all would Hardly doe, for when it\r\nblew hard, our cable would give way and our shipp in dainger of\r\ndriveing ashore, which if had we should lived like Heathens amounge\r\nthe Savage Indians, and never have come to rights, but we spliced and\r\nStrengthend our cables what we could and with much difficulty made\r\nthem hold out. the 21 day of november 81 wee putt out of thiss place\r\nto sea. wee lay here about 22 dayes, feadeing most on lempotts[86] and\r\nMussles, which wee gatherd of the rocks and makes very good foode. our\r\nwine and brandie was a greate Help to us thiss cold weather. clothing\r\nwee had good Store. some times we gott a Penguine, which are plenty in\r\nthese streights, which are as greate as a goose, but cant fly, haveing\r\non their winges onely stubbs of feathers. hear we saw a fier and made\r\nto itt, wheir we saw an Antient Indian, and a younge fellow and a\r\nwoman Indian, which had about their bodies a Seale Skinn to keepe them\r\nwarme. thay saw us and rann away, but we over tooke the younge fellow,\r\nwhich tooke to throwing of Stones. the olde man tooke the water and\r\nwas so cunning in diveing that our Peopple could not gett him, so they\r\nshott him in the water. the woman gott away from us the next day. one\r\nof our cannoes went downe to this place againe, and carried the Indian\r\nthat was taken alonge with him, which Indian carried our peopple to\r\nthre or 4 wigwams, wheir was fier, but could see no peopple. the\r\nfellow cald in their Speech but none appeard, he makeings signes that\r\nthay weare greate tall men with longe beards.[87] when our peopple saw\r\nnone came, thay returned to the cannoe, carying this Indian fellow\r\nwhich was very unwilling to goe but Strugled to gett away, twas as\r\nmuch as 3 or 4 of our men could do to binde him, and force him downe\r\nto the cannoe, His strength was so greate. wee doe Imagin that here\r\nmay be some Spaniards which formerly have been cast away; for to the\r\nSouthwards about 4 legs when wee came out with our Shipp we saw to\r\nvery greate fiers but wear la'ft [_sic_] to see what thay weir, but\r\nwent to sea, stearing away S.W. and B.S. and S.W. the winds weir very\r\nhard att N.W. we went under a pair of courses, haveing no observation\r\nin 3 days after wee came out of these Lempot keys, wee stearing as far\r\nto the westwards for fear of the Island called the 12 Appostle and 4\r\nEvangelist[88] takeing of us upp, which lieth att the entring of the\r\nStreight mouth. the currant setting to the westward out of the\r\nStreights, satt us by Judgement 25 leagues off shore and when we\r\nobserved we weir in the lattd. of 55 deg. 30', the wind being no[r]therly,\r\nand wee so to the Southwards of the Streights could not gett to the\r\nNorthwards againe, but the capt. and Master, with advice of some\r\nothers, concluded to goe about terra fuega,[89] and so to goe through\r\nthe New Streights, the Streights of Maria, which wee had a Journall of\r\n2 Brothers called by name Noddles, which was about 65 years agon sent\r\nout to discover these parts of the world,[90] which thay gave\r\ndescription that thay went about terra Fogoe through thiss Streight of\r\nMaria and weatherd Terra Fogoe, and went downe the west side, and ran\r\ndowne to the Northwards, and entred the Streight of Magelena, and came\r\nthro' into the North Sea, wheir he speakes of aboundance of those\r\nbirds called Penguins, whear thay laded, bold with them.[91] wee had\r\nvery colde weather and about the 3 of december wee passed a cape,\r\ncalled cape Frea, lieing to the South of Terra Fogoe, in the lattd.\r\n59 deg. 30' South.[92] wee finde here about 4 degrees variation, but downe\r\nin 35 and 40 wee had 11 and 12 and 13 degrees variation. wee weir\r\nsomething fearfull of Halling to close into shore, being not\r\nacquainted did not know what danger might be, yett would very\r\nwillingly have save [seen?] the Land, that wee might have beene the\r\nbetter satisfied where we weir. twas very thick weather, that wee\r\ncould seldom take an observation. we Indeavord to make the Cape Horne\r\nbut we weir gott so far to the Southwards.[93] Yett we beleive we weir\r\nnot very farr off shore, for we had thousands of birds about us. the 9\r\nday of December we had a good observation and found our selves to be\r\nin South lattd. 58 deg. 5'. we had the winds att N.E. and N.E. and b.N.,\r\nfine handsome topp saile gailes, sometimes a shower of Snow and\r\nSleete, but miserable colde. now our wines and brandy stand us in\r\ngreate Steade and is the thing under god that keepes us alive. we\r\nstands to the Southward, haling S.E. and S.E. and B.E. After wee had\r\nour last observation, which was 58 deg. 5', when we thought by our Dead\r\nreconning that we weir in the lattd. of 60 or better, wee Steerd away\r\ndue East.[94] we had but little Night, the Daylight was hardly shett\r\nin att all. we standing to the Eastwards saw 3 or 4 greate Islands of\r\nIce and Snow, as we thought, of a good high and very colde about them.\r\nfrom this Cape their are lying 3 or 4 Islands called the Berlingos,\r\nwhich I am to think are those wee tooke to be the Islands of Ice, for\r\nthay are all kiver'd with Snow, and the Burlingos lyeth by the globe\r\nin the lattd. of 59 deg. 00'.[95] One Night as wee weare getting about the\r\nland, some men gott merry, Especially the capt. and his Mess, which\r\ncaused some words to arise between the capt. and Some of the company,\r\nin so much that thay fell to blowes, but the capt. runns into his\r\ncabbon and fetches out a Pistoll laden, and comeing to one of Our\r\nPeopple, by name Richard Hendricks, fier'd itt off as he thought att\r\nhis Head, but itt pleased god itt mist his head and grased on his\r\nneck. the next morning wee found the shott placed in one of the Dead\r\nEyes of the maine shroudes, which was but Jus[t] behinde him. the\r\ncapt. thought he had kil'd the man, cryed out, \"Armes, their was one\r\ndead,\" and he would have kill more, which cabbon mess ran and fetched\r\ntheir Armes forthwith, and those that weir awake, was fetching theirs\r\nlikewise, which had not been soberer then others and more discretion\r\nin them Sharpe had certainly been kill'd. it had likt to have been a\r\nbad buisness, but when the[se] things came to an understandings All\r\nwas husht upp, Especially findeing the man was not so much hurt as wee\r\ndid suppos and was cured in a weeks time. Well, we stears away East,\r\ntill we thought we Had Easting enough to enter the Streights of Maria.\r\nNow we begins to Hall to the Norwards E.N.E., and by observation taken\r\nwe found our selves to be gott to the norwards into 57 deg. 8'. then we\r\nhalls away N.E. and about 4 days after had another very good\r\nobservation. then we found our Selves to be in 50 deg. So. lattd. Shott to\r\nthe Norwards of these new Streights, doubled about all the Lands;\r\naboundance of birds attends us Still. Wee are now gotten to the\r\nStreights Mouth of Magelen, the North side. wee had good Fresh gales\r\natt N.W. and S.W., the winds very variable. we runing into hot weather\r\nto the Norwards and halling about Terra Fogoe to the Eastward wee\r\nfound a greate Currant to the E.N.E. wee weare farther off Shore then\r\nwee Expected, yett wee hal'd away N.E., hopeing that off of Brazill we\r\nshould meete with English, Dutch or Portugeez, to hear how our\r\nbuisness was discourst of att home and to buy a little Provision of\r\nthem. we hal'd away N.E. till we came downe into 14 deg.

March 8, 1682._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Public Record Office, C.O. 1:48, no. 37. The writer,\r\nlieutenant-governor of Jamaica from 1674 to 1688, and at the time of\r\nwriting acting governor, was the same Henry Morgan who in earlier\r\nyears had been the most famous of buccaneers, capturing Portobello in\r\n1668, Maracaibo in 1669, Panama itself in 1671--wonderful exploits,\r\ncarried out with great bravery and cruelty. Now he is governor, holds\r\npiracy in abhorrence, and is determined to suppress it! It must be\r\nremembered, however, that his own exploits were carried out under\r\ncommissions from proper authority, and legally were not piracy. His\r\ncorrespondent, Sir Leoline Jenkins, for twenty years judge of the High\r\nCourt of Admiralty, and at this time also secretary of state, was one\r\nof the most learned admiralty lawyers England ever produced. Morgan's\r\nview of his own competence as admiralty judge in his colony is given\r\nwith engaging frankness in a contemporary letter: \"The office of Judge\r\nAdmiral was not given me for my understanding of the business better\r\nthan others, nor for the profitableness thereof, for I left the\r\nschools too young to be a great proficient either in that or other\r\nlaws, and have been much more used to the pike than to the book; and\r\nas for the profit, there is no porter in this town but can get more\r\nmoney in the time than I made by this trial. But I was truly put in to\r\nmaintain the honour of the Court for His Majesty's service.\" _Cal.

Thence they sailed\r\naway to the Strait of Magellan, but did not go through it, but around\r\nthe Isla del Fuego, which was some six or eight days' distance from\r\nthe Strait of Magellan. In making this passage of Fuego, to enter into\r\nthe North Sea, they were delayed some nine days. They came to\r\nBarbados, where, because of finding there a ship of the King of\r\nEngland, they did not venture to enter.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage they divided the booty and obtained 400 dollars apiece,\r\nfor each one of 74 persons.\r\n\r\nFrom Barbados they went to Antigua, where they were received without\r\ninjury, but rather with good treatment, and from there they divided,\r\nsome going to Nevis in a bilander,[3] others, some 18 of them, to\r\nLondon in the ship whose captain was called Portin,[4] and eight\r\nothers that were the principal ones fled in the ship called the\r\n_Comadressa Blanca_ (_White Gossip_),[5] Captain Charles Howard.

Petition of Paul Sharrett and Claes Pietersen. August 2,\r\n1681._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Suffolk Court Files, no. 2031, paper 1. The story of the\r\n_Salamander_ is curiously interwoven with the early history of the\r\nPrussian navy, on which something has been said in note 1 to document\r\n43. The facts may be made out by a comparison of documents 48 and 49\r\nwith data found in R. Schueck, _Brandenburg-Preussens Kolonial-Politik_\r\n(Leipzig, 1889), I. 113-118, and in a monograph on \"Brandenburg-Preussen\r\nauf der Westkueste von Afrika, 1681 bis 1721\", in Heft 6 of the\r\n_Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften_ of the German General Staff\r\n(Berlin, 1885), pp. 102-105. In the First Brandenburg-Prussian fleet\r\nthat ever sailed out of the Baltic (August, 1680), one of the six\r\nfrigates was the _Churprintz_ (Kurprinz, Electoral Prince), 32 guns,\r\nCapt. Cornelius Reers, and there was a fire-ship, the _Salamander_, 2\r\nguns, Capt. Marsilius (or Marcellus) Cock; the captains were probably\r\nall Dutch. The chief exploit of the squadron was to capture, in time\r\nof peace, a ship of the Spanish royal navy, which thus became the\r\nfirst of the elector's ships actually owned by him. Then Reers and a\r\nsquadron of four frigates and the _Salamander_ sailed to the West\r\nIndies, and spent the winter of 1680-1681 in cruising against Spanish\r\nshipping, though with little success. If Samuel Button's story is true\r\n(document 48), it would seem that the original _Salamander_ must have\r\nbeen lost, and the _William and Anne_ substituted in its place and\r\nrenamed.

Agreement to Commit Piracy. June 30, 1683._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This very curious document (for one does not expect to\r\nfind pirates agreeing in writing to pursue a course of piracy) is\r\nfound embedded in one of the indictments in the case of the\r\n_Camelion_, in vol. I. of the wills in the office of the surrogate,\r\nNew York City, pp. 312-313 of the modern copy. Its presence among\r\nwills requires a word of explanation. The governor of a royal colony\r\nwas usually chancellor, ordinary, and vice-admiral, and as such might\r\npreside in the courts of chancery, probate, and admiralty--courts\r\nwhose common bond was that their jurisprudence was derived from the\r\ncivil (or Roman) law, and not from the common law. Most of his\r\njudicial action was in testamentary cases. It was therefore not\r\nunnatural that the few admiralty cases and cases of piracy tried in\r\nthese early days should be recorded in the same volume as the wills,\r\nthough distinguished by the simple process of turning the book end for\r\nend and recording them at the back. In this case the record begins\r\nwith our document 51; but the present document, copied into one of the\r\nindictments, is earlier in date. The substance of another pirates'\r\nagreement (Roberts's company, 1720, see doc. no. 117) is given in\r\nCharles Johnson, _General History of the Pyrates_, second ed., pp.\r\n230-232; another (Phillips's company, 1727, see doc. no. 120 and note\r\n10), _ibid._, verbatim, pp. 397-398.]\r\n\r\n_June the 30th day, 1683._ Articles of Agreement between us abord of\r\nthe _Camillion_,[2] Nich.

DONGAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Governor Dongan's commission of vice-admiralty \"in the\r\nusual forme\", October 3, 1682, is recorded in the Public Record\r\nOffice, London, C.O. 5:1182, p. 40. James, duke of York, was Lord High\r\nAdmiral from 1660 to 1673; he was proprietor of the province of New\r\nYork from 1664 till he became king in 1685. As Lord High Admiral, he\r\nissued commissions to the colonial governors appointing them as his\r\nvice-admirals. That which he issued, January 26, 1667, to Lord\r\nWilloughby, governor of Barbados, is printed in the _Publications_ of\r\nthe Colonial Society of Massachusetts, II. 187-198. That to Dongan,\r\nissued by James in 1682, when, though excluded from office in England,\r\nhe was still Lord High Admiral of the crown's dominions, was no doubt\r\nsimilar. At this early period the governor himself sometimes acted as\r\njudge; see document 46, note 1. Strictly speaking, what was here\r\nappointed was not a court of admiralty but a commission for the trial\r\nof piracy and other felonies. By the statute 28 Henry VIII. c. 15\r\n(1536), it was provided that cases of piracy should be tried within\r\nthe realm, not by the High Court of Admiralty, but before commissions\r\nspecially appointed for the purpose, and with the aid of a jury. But\r\nthis statute did not extend to the plantations, and until the passage\r\nof the act of 11 and 12 William III. c. 7 (1700), commissioners for\r\nthe trial of piracy in the colonies were usually appointed by\r\ngovernors in their capacity as vice-admirals, and proceeded under the\r\ncivil (Roman) law, not the statute. Another commission, for the trial\r\nof piracy (to Governor Bellomont and others, Nov. 23, 1701) is printed\r\nin E.C.

On the 7th of September she\r\narrived Surrat Rivers mouth, where the President, according to Orders,\r\nfell to unlading her, but by that time they had gott the Guns, 4 or\r\n500 Bales, and some other Goods on shoar, on the 11th Ditto, One of\r\nAbdull Gofores[3] Ships arriving, their people sent the Governour\r\nword, that they were plundered by an English Vessell, severall of\r\ntheir Men killed in fight, and others barbarously used; Upon which\r\nthere was a great noise in Towne, and the Rabble very much incensed\r\nagainst the English, which caused the Governour to send a Guard to Our\r\nFactory to prevent their doing any violence to Our People. the 13th in\r\nthe Morning, the _Gunsway_, one of the Kings Ships, arrived from Judda\r\nand Mocho,[4] the Nocqueda[5] and Merchants, with one voice,\r\nproclaiming that they were robbed by four English Ships near Bombay of\r\na very great Sume, and that the Robbers had carryed their plundered\r\nTreasure on Shoar there, on which there was farr greater noise than\r\nbefore. upon this the Governour[6] sent a very strong Guard to the\r\nFactory and clapt all our People in Irons, shut them up in a room,\r\nplanked up all their windows, kept strict Watches about them, that no\r\none should have pen, ink, or paper to write, stopped all the passages,\r\nthat no Letters might pass to Us. att this time Captain Brown being\r\natt Surat, with some of his Officers and Boats Crew, faired in Common\r\nwith the rest, and so did some others, that were on shoar, to look\r\nafter their sick att Swally;[7] and their Long boat and Pinnace going\r\non Shoar there, for Water and Provisions, They sent one Man to the\r\nChoultrey,[8] to inquire what News, (having heard somewhat of the\r\nRumour). this person they seized on, by severall Peons, which caused\r\nthem immediately to putt their boats off, which they had no sooner\r\ndone, but sundry small Armes were discharged at them. This Caused the\r\nBoats to repair to their Ship, att the Rivers mouth, where the Dutch\r\ntold them, they durst not supply them with any thing while there. But\r\none of them, being ready to sail for Batavia, said, if they would sail\r\nin Company with them, they would supply them with what they wanted,\r\nas soon as they were out of sight of the Rivers Mouth, which was done\r\naccording to promise, and so the _Benjamin_, by the Generall Consent\r\nof their Officers, came hither, having left her Captain and thirty\r\nnine more of her Company behind. as soon as we had a full relation of\r\nthese things, we immediately wrote to Court, to one Issa Cooley, an\r\nArmenian, whom wee intend to make our Vakeel[9] to represent Our Cause\r\nto the King, and to Excuse Our Selves from being concerned in those\r\nbarbarous Actions. Wee Also wrote to the Governour of Surrat and all\r\nthe Great Umbraws[10] round Us to the same effect, hearing by all that\r\ncome from Surrat, that that Citty is in an uproar about Us, and being\r\ninformed also, that Severall Letters are gone to the Siddy[11] (who is\r\nvery near Us with an Army) from Court and Surat, wee are making what\r\npreparation Wee can for our Own defence, nott knowing what this\r\nExtream ferment may produce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Abd-ul-Ghaffar was the richest merchant in Surat. \"Abdul\r\nGafour, a Mahometan that I was acquainted with, drove a Trade equal to\r\nthe English East-india Company, for I have known him to fit out in a\r\nYear above twenty Sail of Ships, between 300 and 800 Tuns.\" Capt.\r\nAlexander Hamilton, _A New Account of the East Indies_, I. 147.

They went next to the Coast of\r\nGuinea, and there they tooke about 5 li. of Gold Dust, under the\r\npretence of Trade; from Guinea they went to Philandepo,[6] where they\r\ncleaned their ship and tooke her lower; from thence they went to\r\nPrinces Island,[7] where they mett with 2 Deanes[8] ships, which they\r\ntooke after some restraine. in those Shipps they tooke some small\r\nArmes, Chestes of Lynnen and perpetuenes,[9] with about 40 l. in Gold\r\ndust and a great quantity of Brandy. they putt them on shoar Except 18\r\nor 20 they tooke with them. they carryed the best of the Danes Shipps\r\nwith them and burnt the other. They stood then for Cape Lopez, and in\r\nthe way mett with a small portugeese, laden with slaves from Angola.\r\nthey tooke some Cloathes and silkes from them and gave them some\r\nprovisions which they were in want of. att Cape Lopaz they only bought\r\nHoney, and sunke the little shipp, the men not being satisfied with\r\nthe Commander. They went next to Annabo[10] and takeing provisions\r\nthere they doubled the Cape and sailed to Madagascar, where they tooke\r\nmore provisions and cleared the ship. from thence they sailed to\r\nJohanna,[11] where they mett a small Junke, put her a shore and tooke\r\n40 peices out of her, and had one of their men killed. they only tooke\r\nin provisions at Johanna. Three English Merchant ships came downe\r\nthither at the same time, but they did not speake with them. They went\r\nthence to a place called Paddy,[12] and soe back to Johanna, touching\r\nat Comora by the way, where they tooke in provisions. at Johanna they\r\ntooke a Junke laden with Rice, which they stood in need of; here they\r\ntooke in 13 French men that had been privateering in those Seas under\r\nEnglish Colours and had lost their ship at Molila, where it was cast\r\naway. Then they resolved to goe for the Red Sea. in the way they mett\r\nwith two English Privateers, the one called the _Dolphin_, the other\r\n_Portsmouth Adventure_. The _Dolphin_, Captaine Want Comander, was a\r\nSpanish Bottom, had 60 men on board and was fitted out at the\r\nOrkells[13] neare Philadelphia. She came from thence about 2 yeares\r\nagoe last January. The _Portsmouth Adventure_ was fitted out at Rhode\r\nIsland about the same time, Captain Joseph Faro Comander. this ship\r\nhad about the like number of men and about 6 Gunns each and they\r\njoyned Company. They came to an Island called Liparan,[14] at the\r\nentrance into the Red Sea, about June last was 12 months. they lay\r\nthere one night and then 3 sale more of English came to them, One\r\ncomanded by Thomas Wake[15] fitted out from Boston in New England,\r\nanother the _Pearle_ Brigantine, William Mues Comander, fitted out of\r\nRhode Island, the third was the _Amity_ Sloop, Thomas Tew\r\nComander,[16] fitted out at New Yorke. they had about 6 Guns each. two\r\nof them had 50 men on board and the Brigantine betweene 30 and 40.\r\nthey all Joyned in partnership, agreeing Captain Every should be the\r\nComander. After they had laine there some time they were apprehensive\r\nthe Moors shipps would not come downe from Mocha,[16a] soe they sent a\r\npinnace thither, which tooke two Boates. they brought away 2 men,\r\nwhich told them the shipps must come downe. In the meane time they\r\nstood into the sea about 3 Leagues and came to an Anchor there, and\r\nhearing by the Pinnace the Moors Shipps were ready to come downe they\r\nweighed and stood to Leparon againe. After they had lain there 5 or 6\r\ndayes the Moores shipps (being about 25 in number) past by them in the\r\nnight unseen, though the passage was not above 2 miles over. they[17]\r\nwas in August last on Saturday night. the next morning they saw a\r\nKetch comeing downe, which they tooke, and by them they heard the\r\nships were gone by, whereupon it was resolved they should all follow\r\nthem and accordingly they wheighed on Monday, but the _Dolphin_ being\r\nan ill sayler they burnt her and tooke the men most of them aboard\r\nCaptain Every and the Brigantine they tooke in two [tow]. the sloop\r\nfell asterne and never came up to them. Captain Wake likewise lagged\r\nbehind but came up to them afterwards. the _Portsmouth_ kept them\r\ncompany. they steered their Course for Suratt, whether the Moores\r\nships were bound. about 3 dayes before they made Cape St. John[18]\r\nthey mett with one of the Moores ships, betweene 2 and 300 tons, with\r\n6 Guns, which they tooke, she haveing fired 3 shott. they tooke about\r\n50 or 60,000 l. in that ship in Silver and gold, and kept her with\r\nthem till they made the land, and comeing to an anchor they espied\r\nanother ship. they made sale up to her. she had about 40 Guns mounted\r\nand as they said 800 men. Shee stood a fight of 3 houres and then\r\nyeilded, the men runing into the Hold and there they made their\r\nVoyage. They tooke out of that ship soe much Gold and Silver in Coyned\r\nmoney and Plate as made up each mans share with what they had taken\r\nbefore about 1000 l. a man, there being 180 that had their Dividents,\r\nthe Captain haveing a Double share and the Master a share and a halfe.\r\nThe _Portsmouth_ did not come into the Fight and therefore had noe\r\nDivident, but the Brigantine had, which was taken away from them\r\nagaine by reason that the _Charles's_ men changing with them Silver\r\nfor Gold they found the Brigantine men Clippt the Gold, soe they left\r\nthem only 2000 peices of Eight to buy provisions. They gave a share to\r\nthe Captain of the _Portsmouth_ and brought him away with them.\r\nCaptain Want went into his ship and sailed into the Gulph of Persia\r\nand the Brigantine (he thinkes) went to the Coast of Ethiopia. Captain\r\nWake went to the Island of St. Maries near Madagascar,[19] intending\r\nfor the Red Sea the next time the Moores ships were expected from\r\nthence. Captain Every resolved to goe streight for the Island of\r\nProvidence. In the way the men mutinied, some being for carrying her\r\nto Kian[20] belonging to the French, neere Brazill, but Captain Every\r\nwithstood it, there being not above 20 men in the Shipp that Joyned\r\nwith him. when they came to the Island of Mascareen[21] in the\r\nLatitude of 21 they left as many men there as had a mind to stay in\r\nthat Island, and about March or Aprill last they arrived in the Island\r\nof Providence with 113 men on board. they came first to an Anchor off\r\nthe Island of Thera,[22] and by a sloop sent a Letter to Nicholas\r\nTrott, Governor of Providence,[23] to propose bringing their ship\r\nthither if they might be assured of Protection and Liberty to goe\r\naway, which he promised them. They made a collection of 20 peices of 8\r\na man and the Captain 40, to present the Governor with, besides\r\nElephants Teeth and some other things to the value of about 1000 l.\r\nThen they left their Ship which the Governor had and 46 Guns in her.\r\nthey bought a sloop which cost them 600 l. Captain Every and about 20\r\nmore came in her for England and Every tooke the name of Bridgman;\r\nabout 23 more of the men bought another Sloop and with the Master,\r\nCaptain Risby, and the rest of the men went for Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Maio, one of the Cape Verde Islands.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Fernando Po, in the Bight of Biafra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Ilha do Principe.

But this Deponent\r\nremembers not the least threatning expression in the said Letter nor\r\ndid he hear such like words from any of the Ships Crew, onely some of\r\nthem said that if they were not admitted to come to Providence they\r\nwould go some where else, and further deposeth That Mr. Governour\r\nTrott returned answer to the aforesaid Letter in writeing in very\r\ncivill termes, assuring Captain Every That he and his Company should\r\nbe wellcome (or words to this purpose), which said assurance was made\r\ngood to them by Governour Trott after their arrivall at Providence as\r\neffectually as they could desire.[2] This Deponent likewise deposeth,\r\nThat upon receipt of Mr. Governour Trotts Letter, or in a little space\r\nof time after, a Collection was made afore the Mast (at which this\r\nDeponent was present) for him the said Governour Trott, to which\r\nCaptain Every contributed 40 Peices of Eight and four Peices of Gold\r\nand every Sailer (being one hundred men besides Boyes) twenty Peices\r\nof Eight and two Peices of Gold a man, which sum being collected were\r\nsent to Mr. Governour Trott by Robert Chinton, Henry Adams, and two\r\nmore, whose names this Deponent doth not call to mind, after which the\r\nsaid Captain Every and his Crew sailed in the said ship _Charles_ for\r\nProvidence, where at their arrivall they delivered up the said ship\r\nwith what was in her to the said Governour Trott, and accordingly\r\nMajor Trott took possession of her in the said Governours name and\r\nafterwards left her in the custody of the Governours Boatswain and a\r\nfew Negroes, whose incapacity or number were not sufficient to secure\r\nthe ship from hurtfull accidents, as this Deponent believes and also\r\nwas informed, the which was made evident by the ships comeing a shoar\r\nabout two dayes after Governour Trott was possessed of her, though she\r\nhad two Anchors at her Bow and one in the hold, at least she had so\r\nmany Anchors when this Deponent and the rest of the Company quitted\r\nthe said ship to Mr. Trott. This Deponent also deposeth That so soon\r\nas Mr. Trott was in possession of the said ship he sent Boats to bring\r\na shoar the Elephants teeth, the sails, Blocks, etc., that was\r\nvaluable in the said Ship, And further saith That he saw severall\r\nBoats Land which were filled with the aforesaid Commodityes and\r\nstores, and that he hath heard severall of the Ship _Charles's_ Crew\r\nsay and affirm (and which this Deponent also doth believe and partly\r\nknow) that at the said Ship's arrivall at Providence she had on board\r\nfifty Tons of Elephants teeth, forty six Guns mounted, one hundred\r\nBarrells of Gunpowder or thereabouts, severall Chests of Buccanneer\r\nGuns, besides the small Armes which were for the Ships use, the number\r\nof which doth not occur to his mind. He further deposeth to the best\r\nof his knowledge and Information the said ship was firm and tight, for\r\nwhereas he went down into her Hold the same day she arrived at\r\nProvidence he then could not perceive she made the least water. And\r\nfurther saith that the said Ship came a shoar as aforesaid two dayes\r\nafter Mr. Trott was possessed of her, he first having taken out of her\r\nwhat was most considerable. this misfortune of the ship happened about\r\nnoon in the said Governour's sight, as this Deponent (who was an Eye\r\nWitness) well knowes. he likewise declares That one named James\r\nBrowne, with severall others of Providence and also severall that had\r\nbeen of the Ships Crew, upon this occasion profered themselves to\r\nundertake weighing her with Casks, But this Deponent never heard that\r\nthe offers aforesaid were accepted, nor that any means was used to get\r\nher off, nor that Governour Trott had any consideration besides that\r\nof getting on Shoar what still remained on board. This Deponent also\r\nsaith That it was generally reported at Providence the Ship was run on\r\nShoar designedly. And this Deponent saith That he left Providence when\r\nCaptain Every did and that the Sloop in which they went was the last\r\nVessell that carryed from Providence any considerable number of the\r\nship _Charles's_ men and that this Deponent was informed a Packet was\r\nsent by Hollandsworths Sloop, which sailed before that in which this\r\nDeponent was, in which also he knowes there was another Packet sent,\r\nwhich this Deponent saw and believes 't was from Governour Trott but\r\nknowes not to whom they were directed. He further deposeth That\r\nneither while he was at Providence nor afterwards he knew or heard\r\nthat the said ship _Charles_ was bilged, but he remembers that Joseph\r\nDawson, who had been Quarter-Master by Captain Every, was sent on\r\nboard her just before his departure to fetch some Cask for the use of\r\nhis Sloop, which Dawson brought on Shoar and then in this Deponents\r\nhearing declared That the said ship was not bilged, the water in her\r\nbeing black and stinking and the Cask being wedged in the Ballast. if\r\nthe Ship had been bilged she would have been full of water whereby he\r\ncould not have gotten the Cask out. And this Deponent alwaies\r\nunderstood That Sir James Houblon and Company of London owned the said\r\nShip and verily believes Governour Trott knew as much. The said\r\nDeponent further deposeth That John Dan, John Sparks and Joseph Dawson\r\narrived in Ireland in Captain Everys Sloop in the Company of this\r\nDeponent, which said Sloop departed from Providence about the\r\nbeginning of last June, and Hollandsworths Sloop about fourteen dayes\r\nor three weeks before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In his defence, _Cal.

Thence they went to Cape\r\nComarine, to cruise for Malocca[10] men, but mist them, and took a\r\nDanish ship, out of which they took two men by force and five more\r\ncame voluntarily aboard, and left the rest aboard the sloop, having\r\nfirst taken severall Piggs of Lead, fire arms, and Gun Powder out of\r\nher. from thence they went to the Island Mauretious,[11] where they\r\ntook in Provisions and so to St. Marys Island near Madagascar, where\r\nthey met with Captain Hoare an Irishman (since Dead) who was commander\r\nof the _John and Rebecca_,[12] a Pyrate of about 200 Tuns, 14 Guns,\r\nbelonging to the Road Island, who had with her a Prize (a pritty large\r\nship) belonging to the Mogulls subjects at Suratt, which he had taken\r\nat the Gulph of Persia, laden with Bale Goods. there was there also a\r\nBrigantine belonging to New York, which came to fetch Negroes, and the\r\nhulk of the said ship which Captain Glover carried thither.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mulatto.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Cape Coast Castle, on the Gold Coast.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Sokotra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Rajpur, a few miles south of Bombay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See paragraph 10 in Capt.

William Stoughton,\r\nlieutenant-governor of Massachusetts 1691-1701, acted as governor from\r\nthe departure of Governor Phips for England in 1694 to the arrival of\r\nGovernor Bellomont in the province, May 26, 1699. Bellomont in June,\r\n1698, was in New York. In the period to which most of our documents\r\nbelong there was always an outburst of piracy after the conclusion of\r\na war, because multitudes of privateers found their occupation gone\r\nwhen peace was proclaimed, and some of them were sure to turn to the\r\nallied trade of piracy.

STOUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE OF WILLIAM KIDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_71. Deposition of Benjamin Franks. October 20, 1697._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Public Record Office, C.O. 323:2, no. 124 I. William\r\nKidd, the most famous pirate in American history, was a Scot, born in\r\nDundee in 1654. In 1689-1690, in command of a captured ship, he took a\r\ncreditable part in the attacks on Mariegalante and St. Martin's by\r\nCaptain Hewetson, who at Kidd's trial testified to his bravery; but a\r\nfew weeks later his men, ex-pirates apparently, ran away with his\r\nship. _Cal. St. P. Col._, 1689-1692, pp. 122, 226, 227; Hargrave,\r\n_State Trials_, V. 326. In 1689 he settled in New York, where he seems\r\nto have been well regarded; in the record of his marriage license, May\r\n16, 1691 (_N.E. Hist. Gen. Reg._, VI. 63) he is styled \"William Kidd,\r\nGentleman,\" and two days earlier the New York assembly (_Journal_, ed.\r\n1764, I. 6, 13) voted him a gratuity of L150 for services in\r\nconnection with the arrival of Governor Sloughter. In 1695, Kidd being\r\nthen in England, Robert Livingston of New York arranged in London with\r\nLord Bellomont, who had been designated but not yet commissioned as a\r\ngovernor in America, and with others, for a privateering voyage under\r\nKidd's command. Other sharetakers were Sir Edward Russell, first lord\r\nof the admiralty, Sir John Somers, lord keeper of the great seal, the\r\nDuke of Shrewsbury, secretary of state, and the Earl of Romney,\r\nmaster-general of the ordnance; and the king himself was to receive\r\none-tenth of the profits of the cruise. Kidd's letter of marque, dated\r\nDec. 11, 1695, is in Hargrave's _State Trials_, V. 307. To it was\r\nadded, Jan. 26, 1696, _ibid._, 308, a commission to apprehend pirates.\r\nKidd sailed from England in April, 1696, in the _Adventure Galley_,\r\n287 tons, 34 guns, 70 men. At New York he increased his crew to 155\r\nmen (there is a list of them in _Cal. St. Pap. Col._, 1700, p. 199),\r\nand sailed thence in September for Madagascar and the East Indies.\r\nWhether it was by his fault that the _Adventure Galley_ slipped from\r\nprivateering and the search for pirates into acts of piracy, or\r\nwhether, as Kidd alleged, his men forced his hand, has been doubted,\r\nbut it is probable that he shared the guilt. In the summer of 1698\r\ncomplaints began to come in from India and from the East India\r\nCompany, and in November, 1698, orders were sent to the governors of\r\ncolonies in America to apprehend Kidd as a pirate whenever he should\r\nappear. The ensuing papers, especially his own narrative and\r\nBellomont's letters, tell the story of his arrival and arrest. As\r\nunder Massachusetts law he could not be condemned to death for piracy,\r\nhe was, probably illegally, carried to England in the spring of 1700,\r\nand there tried at the Old Bailey for the murder of one of his men and\r\nfor piracy. After an unfair trial and on insufficient evidence, he was\r\ncondemned, and was hanged at Execution Dock May 23, 1701.\r\n\r\nAs to Benjamin Franks, we learn from a deposition of William Cuthbert\r\n(_Journal of the House of Commons_, XIII. 26) that two of Kidd's men\r\ndeserted him at Carwar because of his attempts and designs toward\r\npiracy and his cruel conduct toward his men; Franks, Hebrew jeweller\r\nof New York, was apparently one of the two. Apparently he was a Danish\r\nsubject; Westergaard, _Danish West Indies_, p. 110.]\r\n\r\nThe Deposition of Benjamin Franks aged about 47 years (who came out in\r\nthe _Adventure Gally_, a Privateer, Captain William Kid Comander)\r\nInhabitant of New York.\r\n\r\nDeclareth That having lived in Barbadoes and Jamaica and traded in\r\nseverall parts of the West Indies, meeting of late with great losses\r\nof above L12,000 sterling by the Earthquake and Enemyes and through\r\nmisfortune, came to New York and there finding Captain Kid comeing out\r\nwith a full Power to the East Indies to take the Pyrates, which he\r\nshewed me by the means of my Friends, so resolved to go with him to\r\nthe East Indies and to remain there at Surrat or any other place where\r\nI could best follow my profession, being a Jeweller, for he told me he\r\nwould put into some of the said Parts. Wee sailed from New York the\r\n6th September 1696 in Company with a Brigantine belonging to Bermudas,\r\nbound to the Maderaes. there met with a Brigantine from Barbadoes\r\nbound for England who had lost her Mast and Boltsprit, whom Captain\r\nKid assisted with a Mast, Riggin and Canvas, for which kindness [the]\r\nMaster gave him a few flour Barrells with Sugar. the same Brigantine\r\nafter she had what she wanted proceeded on her Voyage. And a day or\r\ntwo after wee espyed a Ship whom Wee gave chase to three days and came\r\nup with her, found her to be a Portuguez from Brazile bound to the\r\nMaderaes. the Captain of the Portuguez pre[sen]ted Captain Kid with a\r\nRoll of Brazile Tobacco and some Sugar, in lieu of which Captain Kid\r\nsent him a Cheshire Cheese and a Barrell of White Bisket, but through\r\nmistake of the Steward the Barrell thought to be Bisket proved to be\r\nCutt and Dry Tobacca. So Wee proceeded to Maderaes and saw the\r\nBrigantine in safe that came under our Convoy. wee stayed there one\r\nday. before wee departed from thence the Portuguez ship came in.\r\nThence wee went to Bona Vista,[2] took in some Salt, thence to St.\r\nJago, tooke in Water and some Provisions; from St. Jago wee steered\r\nour course for Cape Bona Esperanza,[3] but before wee got to the\r\nLatitude thereof Wee met with three English Men of War and a Fireship,\r\nCaptain Warren in the _Windso[r]_ Comodore,[4] Captain Acton in the\r\n_Advice_,[5] the _Tyger_ and Fire Ship I do not know the Commanders\r\nnames. I was on board the Commodore when he told me that Kids\r\nCommission was firm and good and that he would not molest or hinder\r\nhis proceedings for his puting his hands to his Ears, and discoursing\r\nof severall other things of the Voyage amongst the rest the Commodore\r\ntold Kid he had lost a great many of his men and asked him to spare\r\nhim some, who answered that he would let him have 20 or 30, and about\r\na day or two after Kid went on board one of the Men of War again and\r\nin the Evening came on board his own ship very much disguised with\r\ndrink and left the Men of War without sparing them the men he\r\npromised. Some time after had sight of the Cape, did not put in but\r\nwent directly for Madagascar and imported at a place called\r\nTalleer,[6] where took in some Water and provisions. after our being\r\nthere some time came a Sail in sight and came to an Anchor in\r\nAugustine Bay, upon which wee weighed Anchor and came to her, the two\r\nPorts being but a little way distant each from other. We found her to\r\nbe a Sloop from Barbadoes come to buy Negroes, after which Wee\r\nreturned to Talleer, our former Port, and the next day the Master of\r\nthe Sloop came on board Us being very ill when he came. a few dayes\r\nafter ordered the Sloop to come down to Talleer, and the same day she\r\ncame down the Owner and Merchant[7] dyed on board of us, and he that\r\nsucceeded him could by no Means agree with the Master of the Sloop but\r\ncontinually a quarrelling and fighting. Our Captain did what he could\r\nto make up the difference between them but to no purpose. So when wee\r\nhad done getting our provisions etc. on board Wee sailed for\r\nJohanna,[8] and the Sloop followed us, and seeing two Ships gave them\r\nChase, found them to be both East India Men and so went in together in\r\nCompany to Johanna and two India Men came in after. Wee took in Some\r\nWater and went to Mohilla[9] to clean our Ship. And this Sloop still\r\nfollowed Us, but our Captain told him severall times to be gone and\r\nagree amongst themselves, but they took no notice thereof, continuing\r\nwith Us all the time of our Stay here, being about 5 weeks, where\r\nburyed severall of our Company but the just number I know not. when\r\nWee had been there about 5 weeks a Pinnace came on board of Us with\r\nsome Men, the quantity I know not, for being mortall sick, the\r\nMerchant of the Sloop dyed there too. Wee returned from this place to\r\nJohanna and the Sloop in our Company. Wee took in some more water and\r\nsome French Men, the quantity I know not for I was carryed a shoar\r\nsick and lay a shoar all the time wee lay at Johanna. We sailed\r\nthence, leaving the Sloop behind Us, directly for India and touched at\r\na place called Motta.[10] there was 5 Junks ashoar and at an Anchor\r\nditto place. our Captain wanted to take in some water, sending the\r\nPinnace ashoar for some, which the Natives refused, upon which our\r\nCaptain next morning sent both Boats with a matter of 40 Men or\r\nthereabouts with Armes, as I heard lying very Sick of a Feaver, Ague\r\nand Flux, and that he had bought two Cowes and some dates, and 2 dayes\r\nafter the People run away into the Mountains, as I heard. after they\r\nrun away the People sent a shoar, found India Corn and Garravances[11]\r\nin great holes, and brought off likewise six of the Natives, of whom\r\nfour leaped overboard in the Night and swam ashoar. the other two gave\r\n{3} Cowes and 2 sheep for their ransom, as I heard of the Seamen,\r\nlying very ill. from thence wee went to the Babs[12] and there\r\nanchored to wait for the Pyrates, as the Seamen said, but meeting with\r\nnone, sending the Pinnace out 3 or 4 times, as I heard of the Seamen,\r\nbut at Carwar ashoar I heard of the Seamen that they was to go to\r\nMocho.[13] after the Pinnace went with the Captain, Quarter-Master\r\ncame back and gave an account there was 17 Sail, which I heard of the\r\nSeamen as I lay very ill. our Captain ordered two men ashoar on one of\r\nthe Babs. when the Fleet came in sight the Men waved the Jack.[14] the\r\nwhole Fleet came by the Babs on a Saturday in the evening in the month\r\nof August, but the day of the month I do not remember. our Captain\r\nweighed and stood amongst the Fleet, as I heard of the Seamen. the\r\nnext morning at break of day one of the Fleet began to fire at Us, as\r\nI heard of the Seamen, which alarming the rest they all did the same.\r\nthere was one Ship which the Captain said was a Mallabar, pretty near\r\nUs, as I heard of the Seamen. then our Captain ordered the People to\r\nrow up to him, being but little Wind, then the Mallabar fired at Us\r\nand our Captain at him severall Guns. at last our Captain perceiving\r\nan English and Dutch Colours did all he could to get away. the Captain\r\ndesigned to go to the high Land off St. Johns.[15] meeting with a\r\nsmall Vessell under English Colours he chased her and comanded the\r\nMaster to come on board and plundered the Ship. I hearing a great\r\nnoise asked what it was. they told me that our Folks beat the People\r\naboard of the little ship and against night I heard there was a\r\nPortuguez. so doing my endeavour to creep up to speak to the Portuguez\r\nand asked him what was the best news, he told me that he and the\r\nMaster was forced to stay on board of our Ship, and that he did belong\r\nto Bombay, and that our Captain had taken out some Rice, Raisons and\r\nold Cloths and some Money. I heard of the Seamen that our Captain had\r\nInformation of three ships that had gone out of Aden bound for\r\nCallicut being off Carwar, and being in necessity for Wood and Water\r\nput in there, at which time I made great intercession to the Captain\r\nfor leave to go ashoar, which at last I obtained by giving him a\r\nBeaver Hat, for he was unwilling to let any go ashoar but whom he\r\nthought he could trust, for fear they should run away for most of his\r\npeople seemed dissatisfyed and would I believe do as I have done in\r\nmaking their Escape if had opportunity, for the Carpenter and his mate\r\nwith severall others does design to run away with the Pinnace. This I\r\ndo swear by the old Testament to the best of my knowledge and what I\r\nhave heard of the Seamen that all the above written is true.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKS.\r\n\r\nBombay the 20th October 1697.\r\n  Sworn before me:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: One of the Cape Verde Islands; Santiago is a larger\r\nisland of the same group, farther south.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Capt.

Henry Webber, 3d Mate,\r\nwho afterwards Comanded the said ship, and severall others, took the\r\nship from him and went to Brasile, where the Deponent and some others\r\nleft the ship. After that the Deponent had lived at Brasile about one\r\nyeare, a French Vessell which had lost her top mast arrived there\r\nunder the Comand of Mounsieur de Ley, on Board of which Vessell the\r\ndeponent embarqued himselfe for the Coast of India, the said De Ley\r\nbeing bound to Bengall, in the Voyage whereto they touched at the\r\nIsland of Johannah, an Island [whose] inhabitants are Arabians, which\r\nwas in the Month of May or June 1698: and riding there at Anchor with\r\nthe said ship, came a ship of fourty Gunns called the _Resolution_ by\r\nthe Men on Board, But understood her right name was the _Moco_,[2]\r\nfrom Madagaskar, Navigated with about 130 or 140 Men under the Comand\r\nof Captain Robert Culliford. De Ley weighed one Anchor and cut the\r\nother Cable, but Culliford chasing him took him and brought the\r\ndeponent on Board them, being the only Englishman on board De Ley, and\r\nexamined him concerning Deleys Loading, with many threats. after they\r\nplundered the ship and found there 2000 l. in money, besides Wine and\r\nCloath, which they took, and because the Deponent was an Englishman\r\nthey would not let him go on board De Ley again but kept him. After\r\nwhich the said Culliford sayled with the said ship upon the Coast of\r\nIndia: and about the middle of August came up with a Pyrate, who came\r\nout of America some where near Rhroad Island under the Comand of\r\nRichard Chivers, had 80 or 90 men and twelve Gunns, who kept Company\r\nand Consorted with Culliford. And about the End of September last they\r\nmet off of Suratt with a turkey ship belonging to Suratt, which\r\nChivers crew boarded: and the Quartermaster and some of Cullifords\r\ncrew went on Board: she was laden with Pieces 8, Gold and Dollers, was\r\nreputed to the vallue of one Hundred and twenty or thirty thousand\r\npounds. there were some shots made and several turks were killed and\r\nwounded and two or three of Chivers Company: they put the men on\r\nshoare on the Coast of India, sunck their own ship and took the turkey\r\nship and then shared the money, about 700 or 800 l. a man in each\r\nship, and gave the Deponent who pumped for them on occasion and was\r\nready at call 250 l., not deeming him as one of them but in the nature\r\nof a prisoner, and told him if that he would go out with them their\r\nnext Voyage, he should be all one as the rest. thence the said\r\nCulliford and Chivers sayled to Madagascoe, Port St. Marys, a large\r\nIsland about three or four Hundred Leagues in Length inhabited by a\r\nnumerous people being Negroes.\r\n\r\nTHEO.

The said Captain Kidd further told me that, when he and his\r\nCompany were arrived at Madagascar, several of his Company moved him\r\nto go and take a Ship called the _Moco_ Frigat, that lay ready fitted\r\nat a place not far distant from them, in the possession of certain\r\nPrivateers, and to go in the same for the red-Sea. But that he the\r\nsaid Kidd said that if they would join with him he would attempt the\r\ntaking of the said Ship, (supposeing her a lawful Prize, being\r\nformerly belonging to the King of England), but would not afterwards\r\ngo with them on the said design to the red-Sea. Whereupon ninety of\r\nhis the said Kidd's men deserted him, went and tooke the said Ship,\r\nand sailed with the same on the aforesaid design, as he, said Kidd,\r\nwas informed; obliging one Captain Culliver, the then Commander of\r\nher, to go along with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An attorney in New York, and vestryman of Trinity\r\nChurch.]\r\n\r\nAnd the said Kidd further told me That, his men having left him and\r\nhis design frustrated, he thought it his best way to preserve the said\r\nShip then in his possession, and the goods on board her, for his\r\nImployers or the proper Owners thereof: And accordingly, with the few\r\nmen he had then left, which would not joine with the other Ninety in\r\ntheir aforesaid design (being about Twenty in Number) and with a few\r\nother men that he procured at Madagascar to assist him in navigating\r\nsaid Ship, he intended to have brought the same to Boston, according\r\nto his Orders; but touching in his way at the Island of St. Thomas's\r\nand other places in the West-Indies, he there heard that great\r\nComplaints were preferred against him, and he proclaimed a Pirate,\r\nwhich occasioned him to saile to a place called Mona, near\r\nHispaniola;[3] from whence he sent to Curaso,[4] and bought there the\r\nSloop on which he is now on board, and tooke into her out of the said\r\nship to the Value of about eight or ten thousand pounds in goods,\r\ngold, and Plate, for which Gold and Plate he traded at Madagascar, and\r\nwas produced by the sale of sundry goods and Stores that he tooke out\r\nof the _Adventure Gally_, formerly commanded by him, and hath left the\r\nShip taken by his Company, and carryed to Madagascar as aforesaid, at\r\nor near Mona abovesaid, in the Custody of about six men of his owne\r\nCompany and Eighteen others that he got from Curaso (the Merchant of\r\nwhom he bought the said Sloop being intrusted therewith), unto which\r\nhe hath promised to returne again in three months, the said Kidd\r\nresolveing to come into Boston or New-Yorke to deliver up unto your\r\nExcellency what goods and Treasure he hath on board, and to pray your\r\nExcellency's assistance to enable him to bring the said Ship, left by\r\nhim at Mona aforesaid, from thence, the said Ship being disabled from\r\ncomeing, for want of furniture.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mona is a small island lying in the passage between Santo\r\nDomingo and Puerto Rico.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Curacao, Dutch West Indies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Masts, spars, sails, and rigging.]\r\n\r\nBut the said Captain Kidd further informed me, That by reason of what\r\nhis Men had heard in the West-Indies, as aforesaid, of their being\r\nproclaimed Pirates, they would not consent to his coming into any Port\r\nwithout some Assurance from your Excellency That they should not be\r\nimprisoned or molested. And the said Captain Kidd did several times\r\nprotest solemnly that he had not done anything since his going out in\r\nthe said Gally contrary to his Commission and Orders, more than what\r\nhe was necessitated unto by being overpowered by his Men, that\r\ndeserted him, as aforesaid, who evil intreated him several times for\r\nhis not consenting to, or joineing with them in, their actions. And\r\nall the men on board the Sloop now with him did in like manner\r\nsolemnly protest their innocence, and declared that they had used\r\ntheir utmost endeavours in preserving the aforesaid Ship and goods for\r\nthe Owners or Imployers. Said Kidd also said, that if your Lordship\r\nshould see Cause so to direct, he would carry the said Ship for\r\nEngland, there to render an Account of his Proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhich beforegoing contains the particulars of what Captain Kidd and\r\nhis Men related to\r\n\r\nYour Lordship's most humble Servant,\r\n\r\nDUNCAN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_76.

In such times the royal navy\r\nalways relied, for its supply of men, upon impressment, especially of\r\nmerchant seamen. See J.R. Hutchinson, _The Press-Gang Afloat and\r\nAshore_ (London, 1913).]\r\n\r\nThat, about the 6th day of September 1696 the said Captain Kidd sailed\r\nfor the Maderas in Company with one Joyner, Master of a Briganteen\r\nbelonging to Bermudas, and arrived there about the 8th day of October\r\nfollowing; and thence to Bonavista,[4] where they arrived about the\r\n19th of said month, and took in some Salt and stayed three or four\r\ndays, and sailed thence to St. Jago,[4] and arrived there the 24th of\r\nthe said month, where he took in some Water and staied about 8 or 9\r\nDays, and thence sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, and in the Latitude\r\nof 32, on the 12th day of December 1696 met with four English Men of\r\nWar, whereof Captain Warren was Commodore, and sailed a week in their\r\nCompany, and then parted and sailed to Telere, a Port in the Island of\r\nMadagascar, and being there about the 29th day of January, came in a\r\nSloop belonging to Barbadoes, loaded with Rhum, Sugar, Powder and\r\nShot, one ---- French Master, and Mr. Hatton and Mr. John Batt\r\nMerchants, and the said Hatton came on board the said Gally and was\r\nsuddenly taken ill there and dyed in the Cabin: and about the latter\r\nend of February sayled for the Island of Johanna, the said Sloop\r\nkeeping Company, and arrived there about the 18th day of March, where\r\nhe found Four East India Merchantmen, outward bound, and watered there\r\nall together, and stayd about four days, And from thence about the 22d\r\nof March sayled for Mehila, an Island Ten Leagues distant from\r\nJohanna, where he arrived the next morning, and there careened the\r\nsaid Gally, and about fifty men died there in a weekes time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See doc. no. 71, note 2.]\r\n\r\nThat on the 25th day of April 1697 set saile for the Coast of India,\r\nand came upon the Coast of Mallabar in the beginning of the month of\r\nSeptember, and went into Carrwarr upon that Coast about the middle of\r\nthe same month and watered there, and the Gentlemen of the English\r\nFactory gave the Narrator an Account that the Portugese were fitting\r\nout two men of War to take him, and advised him to set out to Sea, and\r\nto take care of himselfe from them, and immediately he set sail\r\nthereupon ... about the 22d of the said month of September, and the\r\nnext morning about break of day saw the said two Men of War standing\r\nfor the said Gally, and spoke with him, and asked him Whence he was,\r\nwho replyed, from London, and they returned answer, from Goa, and so\r\nparted, wishing each other a good Voyage, and making still along the\r\nCoast, the Commodore of the said Men of War kept dogging the said\r\nGally all Night, waiting an Opportunity to board the same, and in the\r\nmorning, without speaking a word, fired 6 great Guns at the Gally,\r\nsome whereof went through her, and wounded four of his Men, and\r\nthereupon he fired upon him again, and the Fight continued all day,\r\nand the Narrator had eleven men wounded: The other Portuguese Men of\r\nWar lay some distance off, and could not come up with the Gally, being\r\ncalm, else would have likewise assaulted the same. The said Fight was\r\nsharp, and the said Portuguese left the said Gally with such\r\nSatisfaction that the Narrator believes no Portuguese will ever attack\r\nthe Kings Colours again, in that part of the World especially, and\r\nafterwards continued upon the said Coast, cruising upon the Cape of\r\nCameroone[5] for Pyrates that frequent that Coast, till the beginning\r\nof the month of November 1697 when he met with Captain How in the\r\n_Loyal Captaine_, an English Ship belonging to Maddarass,[6] bound to\r\nSurat, whom he examined and, finding his Pass good, designed freely to\r\nlet her pass about her affairs; but having two Dutchmen on board, they\r\ntold the Narrator's men that they had divers Greeks and Armenians on\r\nboard, who had divers precious Stones and other rich Goods on board,\r\nwhich caused his men to be very mutinous, and got up their Armes, and\r\nswore they would take the Ship, and two-thirds of his Men voted for\r\nthe same. The narrator told them The small Armes belonged to the\r\nGally, and that he was not come to take any Englishmen or lawful\r\nTraders, and that if they attempted any such thing they should never\r\ncome on board the Gally again, nor have the Boat, or Small-Armes, for\r\nhe had no Commission to take any but the King's Enemies, and Pirates,\r\nand that he would attack them with the Gally and drive them into\r\nBombay; the other being a Merchantman and having no Guns, might easily\r\nhave done it with a few hands, and with all the arguments and menaces\r\nhe could use could scarce restraine them from their unlawful Designe,\r\nbut at last prevailed, and with much ado got him cleare, and let him\r\ngo about his business. All which Captain How will attest, if living.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cape Comorin, the southern point of Hindustan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _I.e._, Madras.]\r\n\r\nAnd that about the 18th or 19th day of the said month of November met\r\nwith a Moors Ship of about 200 Tuns,[7] coming from Suratt, bound to\r\nthe Coast of Mallabar, loaded with two horses, Sugar and Cotton, to\r\ntrade there, having about 40 Moors on board, with a Dutch Pylot,\r\nBoatswain and Gunner, which said Ship the Narrator hailed, and\r\ncommanded on board, and with him came 8 or 9 Moors and the said three\r\nDutchmen, who declared it was a Moors Ship, and demanding their Pass\r\nfrom Suratt, which they shewed, and the same was a French Pass, which\r\nhe believes was shewed by a Mistake, for the Pylot swore Sacrament[8]\r\nshe was a Prize, and staid on board the Gally and would not return\r\nagain on board the Moors Ship, but went in the Gally to the Port of\r\nSt. Maries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The _Rouparelle_; her French pass (from the director of\r\nSurat for the French East India Company) showing a Mohammedan captain,\r\nDutch pilot, and Dutch boatswain, is in _Commons Journal_, XIII. 21.\r\nIt was one of the two passes whose absence at Kidd's trial was fatal\r\nto his case.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"The Dutch-man seeing that, swore his countries oath,\r\n'sacremente'.\" Bradford, _History of Plymouth Plantation_ (ed. 1908),\r\np. 35.]\r\n\r\nAnd that about the First Day of February following, upon the same\r\nCoast, under French Colours with a Designe to decoy, met with a\r\nBengall Merchantman belonging to Surrat of the burthen of 4 or 500\r\nTuns, 10 guns, and he commanded the Master on board, and a Frenchman,\r\nInhabitant of Suratt and belonging to the French Factory there, and\r\nGunner of said Ship, came on board as Master, and when he came on\r\nboard the Narrator caused the English Colours to be hoisted, and the\r\nsaid Master was surprized and said, You are all English; and asking,\r\nWhich was the Captain, whom when he saw, said, Here is a good Prize,\r\nand delivered him the French Pass.[9] And that with the said two\r\nPrizes sailed for the Port of St. Maries, in Madagascar; and sailing\r\nthither the said Gally was so leaky that they feared she would have\r\nsunk every hour, and it required eight men, every two Glasses[10] to\r\nkeep her free, and was forced to woold[11] her round with Cables to\r\nkeep her together, and with much ado carried her into the said Port of\r\nSt. Maries, where they arrived about the First Day of April 1698, and\r\nabout the 6th day of May the lesser Prize was haled into the Careening\r\nIsland or Key, the other not being arrived, and ransacked and sunk by\r\nthe mutinous men, who threatened the Narrator and the men that would\r\nnot join with them, to burn and sink the other, that they might not go\r\nhome and tell the news.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The French pass of this ship, the _Cara Merchant_ or\r\n_Quedah Merchant_ (Kedah, in the Malay Peninsula) is in the _Commons\r\nJournal_, XIII. 21, signed by Francois Martin, the founder of\r\nPondicherry and of the French empire in India. It is dated Jan. 14,\r\n1698, at Hugli (Chandernagore). It names Armenians as commanders and\r\nowner, though the evidence given at Kidd's trials in London (Hargrave,\r\n_State Trials_, V. 287-338) constantly states an Englishman named\r\nWright to have been commander. It should be remembered, in respect to\r\nthese two captures, of vessels ostensibly French, in November, 1697,\r\nand February, 1698, that though the peace of Ryswyk was signed Sept.\r\n20, 1697, the news of its signing did not reach the Indian Ocean till\r\nApril, 1698; and by its terms (art. X.) captures made \"beyond the\r\nLine\" (Equator) within six months from the signing of the treaty were\r\nnot illegal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _I.e._, an hour by the sand-glass.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Wind.]\r\n\r\nAnd that when he arrived in the said Port there was a Pyrate Ship,\r\ncalled the _Moca_ Frigat,[12] at an Anchor, Robert Culliford Commander\r\nthereof, who with his men left the same at his coming in, and ran into\r\nthe Woods, And the Narrator proposed to his Men to take the same,\r\nhaving sufficient power and authority so to do,[13] but the mutinous\r\nCrew told him, if he offered the same, they would rather fire two Guns\r\ninto him than one into the other, and thereupon 97 deserted, and went\r\ninto the _Moca_ Frigat, and sent into the Woods for the said Pyrates\r\nand brought the said Culliford and his men on board again; and all the\r\ntime she staid in the said Port, which was for the Space of 4 or 5\r\nDayes, the said Deserters, sometimes in great numbers, came on board\r\nthe said Gally and _Adventure Prize_,[14] and carried away great guns,\r\nPowder, Shot, small Armes, Sailes, Anchors, Cables, Chirurgeons Chest,\r\nand what else they pleased, and threatned several times to murder the\r\nNarrator (as he was informed, and advised to take care of himselfe)\r\nwhich they designed in the Night to effect but was prevented by his\r\nlocking himself in his Cabin at night, and securing himselfe with\r\nbarrocading the same with bales of Goods, and having about 40 small\r\nArmes, besides Pistols, ready charged, kept them out. Their wickedness\r\nwas so great, after they had plundered and ransacked sufficiently,\r\nwent four miles off to one Edward Welche's house,[15] where his the\r\nNarrator's Chest was lodged, and broke it open, and took out 10 Ounces\r\nof Gold, forty Pounds of Plate, 370 pieces of Eight, the Narrator's\r\nJournal, and a great many papers that belonged to him and the People\r\nof New-York that fitted them out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See doc. no. 74, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: One of the witnesses at Kidd's trial, a member of his\r\ncrew, gives a very different account of the latter's attitude toward\r\nCulliford. It may be quoted, as a specimen of Kidd's unstudied\r\nconversational style. \"On the Quarter-deck they made a Tub of Bomboo,\r\nas they call it, (it is made of Water, and Limes, and Sugar) and there\r\nthey drank to one another; and, says Capt. Kidd, Before I would do you\r\nany Damage, I had rather my Soul should broil in Hell-fire; and wished\r\nDamnation to himself several times, if he did.

Then\r\nit was that the Narrator was left only with 13 Men, so that the Moors\r\nhe had to pump and keep the _Adventure Gally_ above Water being\r\ncarried away, she sunk in the harbour, and the Narrator with the said\r\nthirteen men went on board of the _Adventure-Prize_, where he was\r\nforced to stay five months for a fair Wind. In the meantime some\r\nPassengers presented, that were bound for these Parts, which he tooke\r\non board to help to bring the said _Adventure-Prize_ home.\r\n\r\nThat about the beginning of April 1699 the Narrator arrived at\r\nAnguilla in the West-Indies and sent his Boat on Shore, where his men\r\nhad the News That he and his People were proclaimed Pirates, which put\r\nthem into such a Consternation that they sought all Opportunitys to\r\nrun the Ship on shore upon some reef or Shoal, fearing the Narrator\r\nshould carry them into some English Port.\r\n\r\nFrom Anguilla they came to St. Thomas, where his Brother-in-law Samuel\r\nBradley[16] was put on shore, being sick, and five more went away and\r\ndeserted him, where he heard the same News, that the Narrator and his\r\nCompany were proclaimed Pirates, which incensed the People more and\r\nmore. From St. Thomas set saile for Moona, an Island between\r\nHispaniola and Porto Rico, where they met with a Sloop called the _St.\r\nAnthony_, bound for Montego[17] from Curaso, Mr. William Bolton[18]\r\nMerchant and Samuel Wood Master. The men on board then swore they\r\nwould bring the Ship no further. The Narrator then sent the said Sloop\r\n_St. Anthony_ for Curaso for Canvas to make Sails for the Prize, she\r\nbeing not able to proceed, and she returned in 10 Dayes, and after the\r\nCanvas came he could not persuade the men to carry her for\r\nNew-England, but Six of them went and carried their Chests and things\r\non board of two Dutch Sloops, bound for Curaso, and would not so much\r\nas heele the Vessel or do any-thing; the remainder of the men not\r\nbeing able to bring the _Adventure-Prize_ to Boston, the Narrator\r\nsecured her in a good safe Harbour in some Part of Hispaniola, and\r\nleft her in the Possession of Mr. Henry Boulton of Antego, Merchant,\r\nthe Master, three of the old men, and 15 or 16 of the men that\r\nbelonged to the said Sloop _St. Anthony_ and a Briganteen belonging to\r\none Burt of Curaso.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Kidd's wife's brother; see doc. no. 78, note 1, and\r\n_N.Y.

Richard\r\nCoote (1636-1701), earl of Bellomont in the peerage of Ireland, was\r\ndesignated as governor of Massachusetts in June, 1695, and as governor\r\nof New York in July, three months before his agreement with Livingston\r\nand Kidd, but was not commissioned till June 18, 1697. He arrived in\r\nNew York Apr. 2, 1698, and first came to Boston May 26, 1699. The part\r\nhe had taken in sending out Kidd to capture pirates made Kidd's piracy\r\na matter of special indignation and embarrassment to him, particularly\r\nwhen the affair was used in Parliament, in the session of 1700, as a\r\nmeans of attack on the Lord Chancellor Somers (see doc. no. 71, note\r\n1). The agreement with Kidd was an unwise arrangement, but there is no\r\ndoubt that Bellomont was an honest and zealous official.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 8th July, 99.\r\n\r\n_My Lords_,\r\n\r\nI have the Misfortune to be ill of the Gout at a time when I have a\r\ngreat deal of business to exercise both my head and my hand.\r\n\r\nIt will not be unwellcome News to your Lordships to tell you that I\r\nsecured Captain Kidd last Thursday in the Gaol of this Town with five\r\nor six of his men. He had been hovering on the Coast towards New-York\r\nfor more than a fortnight, and sent to one Mr. Emot to come from\r\nNew-York to him at a place called Oyster-Bay in Nassau Island[2] not\r\nfar from New-York. He brought Emot from thence to Rhoad Island and\r\nthere landed him, sending him hither to me with an Offer of his\r\ncomeing into this port provided I would pardon him. I was a litle\r\npussiled how to manage a treaty of that kind with Emot, a cunning\r\nJacobite, a fast Friend of Fletcher's and my avowed enimie. When he\r\nproposed my pardoning Kid, I told him It was true the King had allowed\r\nme a power to pardon Pyrates; But that I was so tender of useing it\r\n(because I would bring no Staine on my Reputation), that I had set\r\nmyselfe a Rule never to pardon Pyracy without the King's expresse\r\nleave and Command. Emot told me that Kid had left the great Moorish\r\nShip he took in India (which Ship I have since found went by the Name\r\nof the _Quidah-Marchant_), in a Creek on the Coast of Hispaniola, with\r\nGoods to the Value of thirty Thousand pounds: That he had bought a\r\nSloop, in which he was come before to make his termes: that he had\r\nbrought in the Sloop with him severall Bailes of East India goods,\r\nthreescore pound weight of gold in Dust and in Ingotts, about a\r\nhundred weight of Silver and several other things which he beleived\r\nwould sell for about Ten Thousand pounds. Emot also told me that Kid\r\nwas very innocent and would make it appear that his men forced him,\r\nlocking him up in the Cabin of the _Adventure Galley_ while they\r\nrobbed two or three Ships, and he could prove this by many witnesses.\r\nI answered Emot that if Kid could make that appear he might safely\r\ncome into this Port and I would undertake to get him the King's\r\nPardon. I writ a Letter to Captain Kid inviteing him to come in,[3]\r\nand that I would procure a pardon for him, provided he were as\r\ninnocent as Mr. Emot said he was. I sent my letter to him by one Mr.\r\nCampbell of this Town, and a Scotch as well as Kid, and his\r\nAcquaintance: within three or four days Campbell returned to me with a\r\nLetter from Kid, full of protestations of his Innocence, and informing\r\nme of his Design of coming with his Sloop into this Port. I must not\r\nforget to tell your Lordships that Campbell brought three or four\r\nsmall Jewells to my Wife, which I was to know nothing of; but she came\r\nquickly and discovered them to me and asked me whither she should keep\r\nthem, which I advised her to do for the present. For I reflected that\r\nmy shewing an over-nicety might do hurt, before I had made a full\r\ndiscovery what goods and treasure were in the Sloop. All this whole\r\nmatter, even to my writing my Letter to Kid, was transacted with the\r\nprivity and advice of the Councill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Long Island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The letter, June 19, and Kidd's reply, June 24, are in\r\n_Commons Journal_, XIII. 22.]\r\n\r\nKid landed here this day Seven night; and I would not so much as speak\r\nwith him but before Witnesses: I thought he looked very guilty, and to\r\nmake me believe so he and his friend Livingston[4] (who posted hither\r\nfrom Albany, upon newes of Captain Kid's designe of comeing hither),\r\nand Campbell aforesaid began to juggle together and Imbezle some of\r\nthe Cargo; besides, Kid did strangely trifle with me and the Councill\r\nthree or four times that we had him under Examination. Mr. Livingston\r\nalso came to me in a peremptory manner and demanded up his Bond and\r\nthe articles which he sealed to me upon Kid's Expedition, and told me\r\nthat Kid swore all the Oaths in the World that unless I did\r\nimmediately indemnifie Mr. Livingston by giving up his Securities he\r\nwould never bring in that great Ship and Cargo, but that he would\r\ntake care to satisfie Mr. Livingston himself out of that Cargo. I\r\nthought this was such an Impertinence, in both Kid and Livingston,\r\nthat it was time for me to look about me, and to secure Kid. I had\r\nnotice that he designed my wife a Thousand Pound in Gold Dust and\r\nIngotts last Thursday, but I spoyled his Complement by ordering him to\r\nbe arrested and committed that Day, showing the Councill my orders\r\nfrom Court for that purpose. Two Gentlemen of the Councill, Two\r\nMerchants, and the Collector, have the Charge of all the Cargo, and\r\nthey are preparing Inventories of every thing, which shall be sent to\r\nyour Lordships by the next Ship.[5] I delivered up to those five\r\npersons the Jewells that I have formerly told you Kid sent by Campbell\r\nto my Wife, and that at the Councill Board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Robert Livingston (1654-1725), first proprietor of\r\nLivingston Manor, a Scot like Kidd and Campbell, was a member of the\r\ncouncil of New York, and secretary for Indian affairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This inventory is printed in _Commons Journal_, XIII. 29,\r\nand, from a copy preserved by the Gardiner family at Gardiner's\r\nIsland, in C.C.

The total of what\r\nwas secured by the authorities--obtained from Kidd's box and chest,\r\nfrom the _Antonio_, from Campbell, and from Gardiner--was 1111 troy\r\nounces of gold, 2353 ounces of silver, 17-3/8 ounces of jewels or\r\nprecious stones, 57 bags of sugar, 41 bales of merchandise, and 17\r\npieces of canvas. How much leaked away in sloops from Long Island\r\nSound to New York and elsewhere, or in the West Indies, or was\r\ndestroyed in the burning of the _Quedah Merchant_ in Hispaniola, is\r\nmatter for conjecture. The total capture, listed above, was thought to\r\nbe worth L14,000.--Since writing the above, I have come upon Mr. Ralph\r\nD. Paine's _The Book of Buried Treasure_ (London, 1911), which\r\npresents, at p. 82, a photograph of the inventory mentioned above. Mr.\r\nPaine prints our docs. nos. 72, 76, 79, 82, 84, and part of 85.]\r\n\r\nIf I had kept Mr. Secretary Vernon's Orders for seizing and securing\r\nKid and his associates with all their Effects with less Secrecy, I had\r\nnever got him to come in: for his Country men, Mr. Graham[6] and\r\nLivingston, would have been sure to caution him to shift for him selfe\r\nand would have been well paid for their pains. I received the Lords\r\nJustices[7] Orders about Kid, and likewise Mr. Secretary Vernon's,\r\nabout three moneths before my leaveing New-York, but I never\r\ndiscovered them to any body, and when I heard people say, that the\r\nneighbouring Governors had Orders from Court to seize him, I laughed,\r\nas if I believed noe such thing. I wish they may not let him escape\r\nhere, as they have Bradish, a notorious Pyrate. About a fortnight ago,\r\nBradish and another Pyrate got out of the Gaol of this Town and\r\nescaped with the Consent of the Gaoler as there is great reason to\r\nbeleive.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: James Graham, another Scot, was attorney-general of New\r\nYork and a member of the council.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Acting as chief executive, in the absence of King\r\nWilliam.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Joseph Bradish and others of the crew of the ship\r\n_Adventure_ of London, on a voyage from London to Borneo in 1698,\r\npiratically seized the ship and ran away with it to Block Island.

But Bradish, and one of his men, broke\r\nprison and run away amongst the Indians; but it is supposed that he\r\nwill be taken again.\" Mass. Hist.

Judge Sewall, in the debate in the\r\ncouncil as to the matter, declared that he knew of no power they had\r\nto send men out of the province to be tried. _Ibid._, XLVI. 4. He was\r\nprobably right.]\r\n\r\nSince my leaving New-York one of the four Ships has come in that went\r\nfrom thence to Madagascar last Summer and of which I informed your\r\nLordships, and has brought Sixty Pyrates and a vast deall of Treasure.\r\nI hear that every one of the Pyrates paid 150 l. for his passage, and\r\nthe owners, I am told, have cleared thirty Thousand pounds by this\r\nVoyage. It is observable that Mr. Hackshaw, one of the Merchants that\r\npetitioned against me to your Lordships, and Stephen Delancy, a hot\r\nheaded saucy Frenchman and Mr. Hackshaw's Correspondent, are the\r\ncheife owners of this Ship. I hear there were 200 Pyrates at\r\nMadagascar when this Ship came away, who intended to take their\r\npassage in Frederick Phillips Ship and the other Two belonging to New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nA great Ship has been seen off this Coast any time this Week; it is\r\nsupposed to be one Maise, a Pyrate who has brought a vast deale of\r\nwealth from the red Seas.[10] There is a Sloop also at Rhoad Island,\r\nwhich is said to be a Pyrate. I hear the men goe a shoar there in the\r\nday time and return to the Sloop at night and spend their gold very\r\nliberally. We can do nothing towards the taking those Ships, for want\r\nof a man of War. I am manning out a Ship to go in Quest of the\r\n_Quidah-Marchant_ left by Kid on the Coast of Hispaniola: by some\r\npapers which we seized with Kid, and by his own Confession, wee have\r\nfound out where the Ship lyes;[11] and according to his account of the\r\nCargo we compute her to be worth seventy thousand pounds. The Ship\r\nthat carries this is just upon Sailing, and will not be persuaded to\r\nstay any longer; so that I cannot send your Lordships the Inventories\r\nof the Goods brought in by Kid, nor the Informations we have taken\r\nabout him from his own men, till next opportunity. I am, with Respect,\r\n\r\nMy Lords\r\n\r\nYour Lordships most humble\r\nand obedient Servant\r\n\r\nBELLOMONT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: William Maze or Mace was one of the pirates specifically\r\nnamed, along with Tew and Wake, in Kidd's commissions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: For the benefit of treasure-hunters, one might wish one\r\ncould be precise.

On May 16, 1691, Kidd\r\nreceived license to marry at New York Sarah Oort, widow of John Oort,\r\nmerchant of New York. She was a daughter of Samuel Bradley. Kidd was\r\nher third husband. In 1703 she married a fourth. She died in New\r\nJersey in 1744, leaving five children, one of whom was apparently a\r\ndaughter of Kidd. Frederic de Peyster, in his _Bellomont_, p. 29, says\r\nthat she \"is said to have been a lovely and accomplished woman.\"\r\nLovely she may have been, and evidently she was attractive, since she\r\nhad four husbands, but she could not write her own name.

She had then\r\njust come out from England in Kidd's old barkentine the _Antigua_,\r\nwhich Governor Codrington of the Leeward Islands had given him in 1690\r\nto reward his services and replace the ship then stolen from him (see\r\ndoc. no. 71, note 1, and _Portland MSS._, VIII. 78) and which had\r\napparently been his ship ever since. She was indentured to him as a\r\nmaidservant for four years, from July 14, 1695, to July 14, 1699.

July [17], 1699._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Public Record Office, C.O. 5:860, no. 64 XXI; _Commons\r\nJournal_, XIII. 30-31. John Gardiner (1661-1738), grandson of Lion\r\nGardiner, was the third manorial proprietor of Gardiner's Island, an\r\nisland lying three miles northward from Long Island, toward its\r\neastern extremity and near the entrance to the Sound. The narrative\r\nwas sent to the Board of Trade by Bellomont as an enclosure in no.\r\n82.]\r\n\r\nThe Narrative of John Gardner of Gardners-Island, alias Isle of Wight,\r\nrelating to Captain William Kidd.\r\n\r\nThat about twenty dayes agoe, Mr. Emot of New Yorke came to the\r\nNarrators House, and desired a boat to go for New Yorke, telling the\r\nNarrator he came from my Lord at Boston. Whereupon the Narrator\r\nfurnished the said Emot with a boat, and he went for New Yorke, and\r\nthat Evening the Narrator saw a Sloop with Six Guns rideing at an\r\nAnchor off Gardners Island. and two days afterwards in the Evening the\r\nNarrator went aboard said Sloop to enquire what she was, and so soon\r\nas he came on board Captain Kidd (then unknown to the Narrator) asked\r\nhim how himselfe and Family did, telling him that he the said Kidd was\r\ngoing to my Lord at Boston, and desired the Narrator to carry three\r\nNegroes, two boys and a girle, ashore, to keep till he the said Kidd\r\nor his Order should call for them, which the Narrator accordingly did.\r\nThat about two hours after the Narrator had got the said Negroes\r\nashore, Captain Kidd sent his boat ashore with two bailes of Goods and\r\na Negro Boy, and the morning after, said Kidd desired the Narrator to\r\ncome immediately on board and bring Six Sheep with him for his the\r\nsaid Kidds Voyage for Boston, which the Narrator did, when Kidd asked\r\nhim to spare a barrel of Cyder, which the Narrator with great\r\nimportunity consented to, and sent two of his men for it, who brought\r\nthe Cyder on board said Sloop, but whilst the men were gone for the\r\nCyder, Captain Kidd offered the Narrator several Pieces of\r\ndamnified[2] Muslin and Bengalls as a Present to his Wife, which the\r\nsaid Kidd put in a bagg, and gave the Narrator, and about a Quarter of\r\nan Hour afterwards the said Kidd tooke up two or three pieces of\r\ndamnified Muslin and gave the Narrator for his proper Use. And the\r\nNarrators men then coming on board with the said Barrel of Cyder as\r\naforesaid, the said Kidd gave them four pieces of Arabian Gold for\r\ntheir trouble and also for bringing him Wood. Then the said Kidd,\r\nready to saile, told this Narrator he would pay him for the Cyder, to\r\nwhich the Narrator answered That he was already satisfied for it by\r\nthe Present made to his Wife. And this Narrator observed that some of\r\nKidds men gave to the Narrators men some inconsiderable things of\r\nsmall value, which this Narrator believes were Muslins for Neckcloths.\r\nAnd then the Narrator took leave of the said Kidd and went ashore, and\r\nat parting the said Kidd fired four Guns and stood for Block-Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Damaged. Bengals were striped goods, partly silk. Kidd\r\ngave Mrs. Gardiner more than this. A pitcher and fragments of a piece\r\nof cloth of gold are still in the hands of different descendants of\r\ntwo of John Gardiner's wives. See article by John R. Totten in _N.Y.\r\nBiog. Rec._, L. 17-25. The story is told in Thompson's Long Island, p.\r\n203, from a letter of a descendant writing more than a hundred years\r\nago. \"He [Kidd] wanted Mrs. Gardiner to roast him a pig; she being\r\nafraid to refuse him, roasted it very nice, and he was much pleased\r\nwith it. He then made her a present of this cloth.\"]\r\n\r\nAbout three Dayes afterwards the said Kidd sent the Master of the\r\nSloop and one Clarke in his boat for the Narrator, who went on board\r\nwith them, And the said Kidd desired this Narrator to take on shore\r\nwith him and keep for him, the said Kidd, and Order, a Chest, and a\r\nbox of gold and a bundle of Quilts and Four Bayles of Goods, which box\r\nof gold the said Kidd told the Narrator was intended for my Lord; and\r\nthe Narrator complied with the said Kidds request and took on shore\r\nthe said Chest, box of gold, Quilts, and bayles of Goods.\r\n\r\nAnd the Narrator further saith That two of Kidds Crew, who went by the\r\nNames of Cooke and Parrat,[3] delivered to him, the Narrator, two\r\nbaggs of Silver, which they told the Narrator weighed thirty pound\r\nweight, for which he gave receipt. And That another of Kidd's men\r\ndelivered to the Narrator a small bundle of gold, and gold dust of\r\nabout a pound weight, to keep for him, and did also present the\r\nNarrator with a Sash and a pair of worsted Stockins. And just before\r\nthe Sloop sayled Captain Kidd presented the Narrator with a bagg of\r\nSugar, and then tooke leave and sayled for Boston.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Neither of these sailors was of the original crew. Hugh\r\nParrott, of Plymouth, England, joined Kidd at Johanna, and was tried\r\nand condemned with him. His examination at Boston is in _Commons\r\nJournal_, XIII. 29.]\r\n\r\nAnd the Narrator further saith, he knew nothing of Kidds being\r\nproclaimed a Pyrate, and if he had, he durst not have acted otherwise\r\nthan he has done, having no force to oppose them, and for that he hath\r\nformerly been threatned to be killed by Privateers, if he should carry\r\nunkindly to them.\r\n\r\nJOHN GARDINER.\r\n\r\nThe within named Narrator further saith That whilst Captain Kidd lay\r\nwith his Sloop at Gardners Island, there was a New Yorke Sloop,\r\nwhereof one Coster is Master, and his Mate was a little black man,\r\nunknown to the Narrator by name,[4] who, as it was said, had been\r\nformerly Captain Kidds Quarter Master, and another Sloop belonging to\r\nNew-Yorke, Jacob Fenick[5] Master, both which lay near to Kidds Sloop\r\nthree dayes together, and whilst the Narrator was on board with\r\nCaptain Kidd, there was several Bayles of Goods and other things put\r\nout of the said Kidds Sloop and put on board the other two Sloops\r\naforesaid, and the said two Sloops sayled up the Sound. After which\r\nKidd sailed with his Sloop for Block Island, and being absent by the\r\nSpace of three dayes returned to Gardners-Island again in company of\r\nanother Sloop belonging to New-Yorke, Cornelius Quick Master, on board\r\nof which was one Thomas Clarke of Setauket, commonly called Whisking\r\nClarke, and one Harrison of Jamaica, Father to a boy that was with\r\nCaptain Kidd, and Captain Kidds Wife was then on board his own\r\nSloop.[6] And Quick remained with his Sloop there from noon to the\r\nevening of the same day, and tooke on board two Chests that came out\r\nof the said Kidd's Sloop, under the observance of this Narrator, and\r\nhe believes several Goods more, and then sailed up the Sound. Kidd\r\nremained there with his Sloop until next morning, and then set saile\r\nintending, as he said, for Boston. Further the Narrator saith That the\r\nnext day after Quick sayled with his Sloop from Gardners Island, he\r\nsaw him turning out of a Bay called Oyster-pan Bay,[7] although the\r\nwind was all the time fair to carry him up the Sound; the Narrator\r\nsupposes he went in thither to land some Goods.\r\n\r\nJOHN GARDINER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Carsten Luersen and Hendrick van der Heul.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Jacob Phoenix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Capt.

The original is endorsed as received Sept. 20.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 26th July 99.\r\n\r\n_My Lords,_\r\n\r\nI gave your Lordships a short Account of my taking Capt. Kidd, in my\r\nLetter of the 8th Instant:[2] I shall in this Letter confine myselfe\r\nwholly to an Account of my Proceeding with him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Doc. no. 77.]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of last Month Mr. Emot, a Lawyer of New-York, came late at\r\nNight to me and told me he came from Captain Kidd, who was on the\r\nCoast with a Sloop, but would not tell me where: That Kidd had brought\r\n60 Pound Weight of gold, about a 100 Weight of Silver, and 17 Bales of\r\nEast-India goods, (which was less by 24 Bales than we have since got\r\nin the Sloop), That Kidd had left behind him a great Ship near the\r\nCoast of Hispaniola that nobody but himselfe could find out, on board\r\nwhereof there were in bale goods, Saltpetre, and other things to the\r\nValue of at least 30,000 L.: That if I would give him a pardon, he\r\nwould bring in the Sloop and goods hither, and would go and fetch the\r\ngreat Ship and goods afterwards. Mr. Emot delivered me that Night Two\r\nFrench Passes, which Kidd took on board the Two Moors Ships which were\r\ntaken by him in the seas of India (or, as he alleges, by his Men\r\nagainst his Will). One of the Passes wants a date in the original, as\r\nin the Copy I send your Lordships; and they go No. I. and No. II.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See doc. no. 87, note 2.]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 15 of June, I sent Mr. Campbel, the Post-Master of\r\nthis town, Kidd's Countryman and acquaintance, along with Mr. Emot, to\r\ninvite Kidd to come into this Port. Mr. Campbel returned hither on the\r\n19 of June, and gave in a Memorial to my selfe and the Councel,\r\ncontaining what had passed between him and Kidd: The said Memorial\r\ngoes No. 3.[4] On the said 19 June, as I sate in Councel, I wrote a\r\nLetter to Captain Kidd, and shewed it to the Councel, and they\r\napproving of it, I dispatched Mr. Campbel again to Kidd with my said\r\nLetter, a Copy whereof goes No. 4. Your Lordships may observe That the\r\npromise I make Captain Kidd, in my said Letter, of a kind reception,\r\nand promising the King's pardon for him, is conditionall; that is,\r\nprovided he were as innocent as he pretended to be. But I quickly\r\nfound sufficient Cause to suspect him very guilty, by the many lyes\r\nand Contradictions he told me. I was so much upon my guard with Kidd\r\nthat, he arriving here on Saturday the [first] of this moneth, I would\r\nnot see him but before witnesses; nor have I ever seen him since, but\r\nin Councel twice or thrice that we examined him; and the day he was\r\ntaken up by the Constable, it happened to be by the door of my\r\nLodging,[5] and he rushed in and came running to me, the Constable\r\nafter him. I had him not seized till Thursday the 6th instant, for I\r\nhad a mind to discover where he had left the great Ship, and I thought\r\nmy selfe secure enough from his running away, because I took care not\r\nto give him the least umbrage of my Design of seizing him, Nor had I\r\ntill that day that I produced my orders from Court for apprehending of\r\nKidd, communicated them to anybody. And I found it necessary to shew\r\nmy orders to the Councel, to animate them to join heartily with me in\r\nsecuring Kidd, and examining his Affair nicely, to discover what we\r\ncould of his behaviour in his whole Voyage. Another reason why I took\r\nhim not up sooner was that he had brought his wife and Children hither\r\nin the Sloop with him, who I believed he would not easily forsake. He\r\nbeing examined twice or thrice by me and the Councel, and also some of\r\nhis men, I observed he seemed much disturbed, And the last time we\r\nexamined him I fancied he looked as if he were upon the wing, and\r\nresolved to run away, and the Gentlemen of the Councel had some of\r\nthem the same thought with mine, so that I took their Consent in\r\nseizing and committing him.[6] But the officers appointed to seize his\r\nmen were so careless as to let 3 or 4 of his men escape, which\r\ntroubled me the more because they were old New-York Pyrates. The next\r\nthing the Councel and I did, was to appoint a Committee of trusty\r\npersons to search for the goods and Treasure brought by Kidd and to\r\nsecure what they should find till the King's pleasure should be known\r\nas to the Disposition thereof, as my orders from Mr. Secretary Vernon\r\nimport. The said Committee were made up of Two Gentlemen of the\r\nCouncel, Two Merchants, and the Deputy Collector, whose names are to\r\nthe inclosed Inventory of the goods and Treasure. They searched Kidd's\r\nLodging, and found hid and made up in Two sea-beds, a bag of gold dust\r\nand Ingots of the value of about 1000 L. and a bag of silver, part\r\nmoney and part pieces and piggs of silver, value as set down in the\r\nsaid Inventory. In the above bag of gold were several litle bags of\r\ngold; all particulars are, I believe, very justly and exactly set down\r\nin the Inventory. For my part, I have medled with no manner of thing,\r\nbut put every thing under the management of the Councel, and into the\r\nCustody of the before mentioned Committee, that I might be free from\r\nthe Suspicion and Censure of the World. The enameled box mentioned in\r\nthe beginning of the Inventory is that which Kidd made a present of to\r\nmy wife by Mr. Campbel, which I delivered in Councel to the said\r\nCommittee to keep with the rest of the Treasure. There was in it a\r\nstone ring, which we take to be a Bristoll Stone;[7] if it were true,\r\nit would be worth about 40 L. And there was a small stone unset which\r\nwe believe is also counterfeit, and a sort of a Locket, with four\r\nSparks which seem to be right diamonds; for there is nobody here that\r\nunderstands Jewels. If the Box and all that is in it were right, they\r\ncannot be worth above 60 L.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Doc. no. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Peter Sergeant, a rich merchant, who had the finest house\r\nin Boston, had given it over to the new governor's use. Mass. Hist\r\nSoc., _Proc._, XXII. 123-131. Lord Bellomont held his council meetings\r\nin its best chamber. It was afterward the famous Province House,\r\nhaving been bought later by the province, for a residence for the\r\ngovernors. Hawthorne, at the beginning of part II. of his _Twice-Told\r\nTales_, describes it as it was in 1845. A portion of the walls was in\r\n1919 still visible from Province Court.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Dr. Edward Everett Hale gives quotations from the council\r\nrecords, in _Memorial History of Boston_, II. 177-178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Rock-crystal, of a kind found near Bristol, England.]\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will see in the middle of the Inventory a parcel of\r\nTreasure and Jewels delivered up by Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's\r\nIsland, in the Province of New-York, and at the East End of\r\nNassau-Island, the Recovering and saving of which Treasure is owing to\r\nmy Own Care and quickness. I heard by the greatest accident in the\r\nworld, the day that Captain Kidd was committed, That a Man had offered\r\n30 L. for a Sloop to carry him to Gardiner's Island, and Kidd having\r\nowned he had buried some Gold on that Island, (though he never\r\nmentioned to us any Jewels, nor, I believe, would he have owned the\r\ngold there but that he thought he should himselfe be sent for it), I\r\npresently reflected that that man (whom I have since discovered to be\r\none of Kidd's Men) was to defeat us of that Treasure; I privately\r\nposted away a Messenger by Land with a peremptory order to Mr.\r\nGardiner in the King's name to come forthwith, and deliver up such\r\nTreasure as Kidd or any of his Crew had lodged with him; acquainting\r\nhim That I had committed Kidd to Goal, as I was ordered to do by the\r\nKing. My Messenger made great haste, and was with Gardiner before\r\nanybody, and Gardiner, who is a very substantial man, brought away the\r\nTreasure without delay, and by my direction delivered it into the\r\nHands of the Committee. If the Jewels be right, as it is supposed they\r\nare, but I never saw them, nor the gold and silver brought by\r\nGardiner, then we guesse that the parcel brought by him may be worth\r\n(Gold, Silver and Jewels) 4500 L. And besides Kidd had left Six bales\r\nof goods with him, one of which was twice as big as any of the rest;\r\nand Kidd gave him a particular Charge of that bale, and told him it\r\nwas worth 2000 L. The six bales Gardiner could not bring, but I have\r\nordered him to send them by a Sloop that is since gone from hence to\r\nNew York, and which is to return speedily. We are not able to set an\r\nexact value on the goods and Treasure we have got, because we have not\r\nopened the bales we took on board the Sloop; But we hope when the six\r\nbales are sent in by Gardiner, what will be then in the hands of the\r\nGentlemen appointed to that Trust, will amount to about 14000 L. I\r\nhave sent strict orders to my Lieutenant Governor at New York,[8] to\r\nmake dilligent Search for the Goods and Treasure sent by Kidd to New\r\nYork in Three Sloops mentioned in Gardiner's affidavit,[9] which I\r\nsend with the other affidavits and Informations to your Lordships; and\r\nI believe I have directed him where to find a Purchase in a house at\r\nNew York, which by a hint I have had I am apt to believe will be found\r\nout in that house. I have sent to search elsewhere a certain place,\r\nstrongly suspected to have received another depositum of gold from\r\nKidd. I am also upon the hunt after Two or Three Arch Pyrates, which\r\nI hope to give your Lordships a good Account of by next Conveyance. If\r\nI could have but a good able Judge and Attorney General at York, a Man\r\nof war there and another here, and the Companies recruited and well\r\npaid, I will rout Pirates and Piracy entirely out of all this north\r\npart of America, but as I have but too often told your Lordships, it\r\nis impossible for me to do all this alone in my single person.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Capt. John Nanfan; see doc. no. 73, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Doc. no. 79.]\r\n\r\nI wrot your Lordships word in my last letter of the 8 Instant That\r\nBradish the Pyrate and one of his Crew were escaped out of the goal of\r\nthis Town. We have since found that the Goaler was Bradish's kinsman,\r\nand the Goaler confessed they went out at the prison door, and that he\r\nfound it wide open; we had all the reason in the world to believe the\r\nGoaler was consenting to the escape: by much ado I could get the\r\nCounsel to resent the Goaler's behaviour, but by meer Importunity I\r\nhad the fellow before us; we examined him, and, by his own Story and\r\naccounts given us of his suffering other prisoners formerly to escape,\r\nI prevailed to have him turned out and a prosecution ordered against\r\nhim to the Attorney Generall. I have also, with some difficulty, this\r\nlate Session of Assembly here, got a bill to pass, That the Goal be\r\ncommitted to the Care of the High Sheriffe of the County, as in\r\nEngland, with a Salary of 30 L. _per Annum_, to the said Sheriffe: I\r\nwould have had it 50 L. _per Annum_, for the Sheriff's Incouragement\r\nto be honest and carefull, but I could not prevail. I am forced to\r\nallow the Sheriff 40 s. per Week for keeping Kidd safe; otherwise I\r\nshould be in some doubt about him. He has without doubt a great deal\r\nof gold, which is apt to tempt men that have not principles of honour;\r\nI have therefore, to try the power of dull Iron against gold, put him\r\ninto Irons that Weigh 16 Pound. I thought it moderate enough, for I\r\nremember poor Doctor Oates[10] had a 100 weight of Iron on him when he\r\nwas a prisoner in the late Raign. There never was a greater Lyar or\r\nThief in the World than this Kidd; notwithstanding he assured the\r\nCouncel and me every time we examined him That the great Ship and her\r\nCargo waited his return to bring her hither, and now your Lordships\r\nwill see by Two severall Informations of Masters of Ships from\r\nCuracao, that the Cargo has been sold there, and in one of them it is\r\nsaid they have burnt that noble Ship, and without doubt, it was by\r\nKidd's order, that the Ship might not be an evidence against him, for\r\nhe would not own to us her Name was the _Quidah-Marchand_, though his\r\nmen did. Andries Henlyne, and Two more, brought the first news to York\r\nof the sale of that Cargo at Curacao; and never such pennyworths heard\r\nof for Cheapness; Captain Evertz is he who has brought the news of the\r\nShip's being burnt. She was of about 500 Ton, and Kidd told us at the\r\nCouncel, there never was a stronger or stancher Ship seen. His Lying\r\nhad like to have involved me in a Contract that would have been very\r\nchargeable and to no manner of purpose, as he has ordered Matters. I\r\nwas advised by Counsel to dispatch a Ship of good Countenance to go\r\nand fetch away that Ship and Cargo. I had agreed for a Ship of 300\r\ntons, 22 Guns, and I was to man her with 60 men, to force (if there\r\nhad been need of it) the Men to yield who were left with the Ship. I\r\nwas just going to seal the writing, when I bethought myself it were\r\nbest to presse Kidd once more to tell me Truth: I therefore sent to\r\nhim Two Gentlemen of the Councel to the Goal, and he at last owned\r\nThat he had left a power with one Mr. Henry Bolton, a Marchand of\r\nAntegoa whom he had Committed the Care of the Ship to, to sell and\r\ndispose of all the Cargo: upon which Confession of Kidds I held my\r\nhand from hireing that great Ship, which would have cost 1700 L. by\r\nComputation. And now to-morrow I send the Sloop Captain Kidd came in,\r\nwith Letters to the Lieutenant Governor of Antegoa, Colonel Yeomans,\r\nto the Governors of St. Thomas's Island and Curacao, to seize and\r\nsecure what effects they can, that was late in the possession of Kidd,\r\nand on board the _Quidah-Marchand_. There is one Burk, an Englishman,\r\nthat lives at St. Thomas, who has got a great Store of the goods and\r\nmony for Kidd's account. St. Thomas belongs to the Danes, but I hope\r\nto retrieve what Burt has in his Hands.[11] The sending this Sloop\r\nwill cost but about 300 L. if she be out Three moneths. I hope your\r\nLordships will take care, that immediate orders be sent to Antegoa to\r\nsecure Bolton, who must have plaid the Knave egregiously; for he could\r\nnot but know that Kidd came knavishly by that Ship and Goods. It is\r\nreported That the Dutch of Curacao have loaded Three Sloops with those\r\nGoods, and sent them to Holland; perhaps it were not amiss to send and\r\nwatch their Arrivall in Holland, if it be practicable to lay Claim to\r\nthem there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Titus Oates, the scurrilous and perjured informer,\r\nwonderfully successful with his \"Popish Plot\" in 1679 and 1680, thrown\r\ninto prison, under heavy irons, in 1684. He was still living in 1699.\r\nHis doctoral degree (\"D.D. of Salamanca\") was spurious.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The reply of the governor of St. Thomas is doc. no. 83.]\r\n\r\nSince my Committment of Kidd, I hear That upon his approach to this\r\nport, his heart misgave him, and he proposed to his Men the putting to\r\nSea again and going to Caledonia,[12] the new Scotch Settlement near\r\nDarien, but they refused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Caledonia was the settlement on the isthmus of Panama to\r\nwhich the Darien Company, amid so much enthusiasm on the part of the\r\nScottish nation (see Macaulay's twenty-fourth chapter), had sent out\r\nits colony in 1698. The settlement had proved a disastrous failure and\r\nhad been abandoned, and the ships bringing away the wretched survivors\r\nwere already approaching New York, but neither Kidd nor Bellomont yet\r\nknew this.]\r\n\r\nI desire I may have orders what to do with Kidd, and all his and\r\nBradish's Crew; for, as the Law stands in this Country, if a pyrate\r\nwere Convict, yet he cannot suffer Death: And the Counsell here\r\nrefused the bill to punish Privateers and Pyrates which your Lordships\r\nsent with me from England with a direction to recommend it at New York\r\nand here, to be passed into a Law. I shall by next Conveyance acquaint\r\nyour Lordships what a prejudice I have found in some of the Counsel to\r\nthe Laws of England this Session, but having writ myself almost dead,\r\nI must till another Opportunity forbear to treat of the affairs of\r\nthis Province; but when I do, I must tell your Lordships beforehand, I\r\nwill not dissemble with you to favour any man or number of men; I am\r\nboth above it, and I should thinke I did not do the part of an honest\r\nman, if I concealed any thing from you that tends to the prejudice of\r\nthe Interest of England.\r\n\r\nYou will observe by some of the Informations I now send, That Kidd\r\ndid not only rob the Two Moors Ships, but also a Portugueze Ship;\r\nwhich he denied absolutely to the Counsel and me.\r\n\r\nI send your Lordships 24 severall Papers and Evidences relating to\r\nCaptain Kidd. It is impossible for me to animadvert and make remarks\r\non the several matters contained in the said papers, in the weak\r\nCondition I am at present; but must leave that Trouble to Mr.\r\nSecretary Popple,[13] whose excellent clear method in business fits\r\nhim incomparably beyond me for such a Work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: William Popple the elder, secretary to the Board of\r\nTrade from 1696 to 1708.]\r\n\r\nI will always continue to be, with much Respect,\r\n\r\nMy Lords,\r\n\r\nYour Lordships most humble\r\nand obedient Servant,\r\n\r\nBELLOMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_83.

THOMAS, September 1, 1699.\r\n\r\n_To His Excellency Bellomont:_\r\n\r\n_My Lord:_\r\n\r\nI have had the honor to receive by way of Captain ---- Carry[2] Your\r\nExcellency's agreeable letter of July 26, and to understand fully from\r\nit what Your Excellency has been pleased to write as to the pirate\r\nWill Kidd, upon which I shall serve Your Excellency with the following\r\nreply. The aforesaid Will Kidd, with his freight-ship under the\r\nEnglish flag, came to anchor off this harbor, out of range of the\r\nKing's fortress, and then sent his shallop to land with a letter to\r\nme, in which he asked me for protection, further declaring that he was\r\ninnocent as to robbing the subjects of the Mogul in the East Indies.\r\nHis course of conduct being at that time still unknown to me, I wrote\r\nhim in reply that, in case he was an honorable man, I would protect\r\nhim, but he wished to have assurance that I would not give him up to\r\nany war-ship of His Majesty of Great Britain that should come to\r\ndemand him. This I declined to give, whereupon he, understanding that\r\nI had forbidden all inhabitants to sell him any provisions, set sail\r\nagain.[3] Since that time I have heard that he lay at anchor near the\r\nisland of Mona, and that one Bolton of Antigua had been with him, to\r\ntransact business. Afterward there came into this harbor a brigantine\r\nbelonging to Barbados, on which one Will Burcke[4] was merchant,\r\nconcerning whom I had no suspicion, still less the thought that he\r\nwould dare to undertake bringing in here any pirate goods; yet I\r\nlearned the other day that he by night had brought a quantity of goods\r\nto land, which, according to reports, he had sold to Mr. Pedro van\r\nBellen, general director for the Electoral Brandenburg Privileged\r\nCompany, and which are also stored in the Brandenburg warehouse.[5] I\r\nhave not been able to get at the aforesaid goods, because the said\r\nBrandenburg patentees have here their own law and privileges, but I\r\nhave caused the said Will Burcke to be arrested, and on his giving\r\nbail have let him return with the brigantine, yet on condition that he\r\nshould discharge his responsibility to Barbadoes, he being a subject\r\nof His Majesty of England and resident there. Since that time he has\r\ncome here again from Barbados, bringing with him a recommendation from\r\nGovernor Grey[6] to me, and is living here still at the Brandenburg\r\nLodge, but all the aforesaid goods have, it is said, been transported\r\nto other places. This is all the information that I can give Your\r\nExcellency respecting this matter, at the same time assuring you that\r\nno subjects of his Royal Majesty of Denmark, my sovereign Lord, or\r\ninhabitants here, have traded with the aforesaid Kidd, for in that\r\nmatter I have enforced good order. Meanwhile I have forthwith sent a\r\nmember of the council to Denmark, to report most submissively to His\r\nRoyal Majesty, my most gracious King and Lord, all these matters just\r\nas they have occurred. Herewith closing, and commending myself to Your\r\nExcellency, to maintain all good friendship and further good\r\ncorrespondence, I remain\r\n\r\nYour Excellency's\r\n\r\nHumble Servant\r\n\r\nJ.

Endorsed as\r\nreceived Jan. 19, 1700, and read at the Board Feb. 9.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON the 29 November 99.\r\n\r\n_My Lords_\r\n\r\nI gave your Lordships an account in my Letter of the 24th of last\r\nmoneth[2] by the last ship that went hence for England, of my taking\r\nJoseph Bradish and Tee Wetherley, the two Pyrates that had escaped\r\nfrom the Goal of this town;[3] and I then also writ that I hoped in a\r\nlittle time to be able to send your Lordships the news of my taking\r\nJames Gill[am] the Pyrat that killed Captain Edgecomb, Commander of\r\nthe _Mocha_ frigat for the East India Company,[4] and that with his\r\nown hand while the Captain was asleep, and Gillam is supposed to be\r\nthe man that Incouraged the Ship's Company to turn Pyrats, and that\r\nship has ever since been robbing in the Red Sea and Seas of India, and\r\ntaken an Incredible deal of wealth; if one may believe the reports of\r\nmen that are lately come from Madagascar, and that saw the _Mocha_\r\nfrigat there, she has taken above two millions sterling. I have been\r\nso lucky as to take James Gillam, and he is now in Irons in the Goal\r\nof this town, and at the same time with him was sie[ze]d one Francis\r\nDole,[5] in whose house he was harboured, who proves to be one of\r\nHore's Crew, H[ore] one of Colonel Fletcher's Pyrates commissioned by\r\nhim from New York; Dole is also committed to Goal. My taking of Gillam\r\nwas so very accidentall that I cannot forbear giving your Lordships a\r\nnarrative of it, and one would believe there was a strange fatality in\r\nthat m[an's] Starrs. On Saturday the 11th Instant late in the evening\r\nI had a letter from Colonel Sanford,[6] Judge [of] the Admiralty Court\r\nin Rhode-Island, giving me an account that Gillam had been there, but\r\nwas come towards Boston a fortnight before, in order to ship himselfe\r\nfor some of the Islands, Jamaica or Barbados, that he was troubled he\r\nknew it not sooner, and was affraid his Intelligence would come too\r\nlate to me; that the Messenger he sent knew the Mare Gillam rode on\r\n[to] this town. I was in despair of finding the man, because Colonel\r\nSanford writ to me that he was g[one] to this town so long a time as a\r\nfortnight before that; however I sent for an honest Constable I had\r\nmade use of in the apprehending of Kidd and his men, and sent him with\r\nColonel Sanford's Messenger to examine and search all the Inns in Town\r\nfor the mare, and at the first Inn they went to, they found her tied\r\nup in the yard; the people of the Inn reported that the man that\r\nbrought her thither, had lighted off her about a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore, had there tied her, but went away without saying anything to\r\nanybody. Upon notice of this I gave order to the Master of the Inn\r\nthat if any body came to look after the mare, he should be sure to\r\nseize and secure him, but no body came for her. The next morning which\r\nwas Sunday I summoned [a] Council, and we published a Proclamation,\r\nwherein I promised a reward of 200[l.] for the seizing and securing\r\nGillam, whereupon there was the strictest search [all that] day, and\r\nthe next, that was ever made in this part of the world, but we had\r\nmissed him, if I had not been Informed of one Captain Knot, as an old\r\nPyrate and therefore likely [to k]now where Gillam was concealed.[7] I\r\nsent for Knot and examined him, promising h[im if h]e would make an\r\nIngenious Confession, I would not molest or prosecute him; he seemed\r\n[mu]ch disturbed, but would not confesse anything to purpose. I then\r\nsent for his wife and examined her on oath apart from her husband, and\r\nshe confessed that one who went by the [name] of James Kelly had\r\nlodged severall nights in her house, but for some nights past [lo]dged\r\nas she believed in Charlestown Crosse the River. I knew he went by the\r\nname of Kelly, [the]n I examined Captain Knot again, telling him his\r\nwife had been more free and ingenious [tha]n him, which made him\r\nbelieve she had told all; and then he told me of Francis Dole in\r\nCharlestown, and that he believed Gillam would be found there. I sent\r\nhalf a dousin men immediately over the water to Charlestown and Knot\r\nwith them, they beset the house, and searched it but found not the\r\nman, Dole affirming with many protestations he was not there, neither\r\nknew [of] any such man. Two of the men went through a field behind\r\nDole's house, and passing [thr]ough a second field they met a man in\r\nthe dark (for it was ten a clock at night) whom they [seize]d at all\r\nadventures, and it happened as oddly as luckily to be Gillam, he had\r\nbeen treating [some] young women some few miles off in the Country,\r\nand was returning at night to his Landlord Dole's house, and so was\r\nmet with. I examined him, but he denied everything, even that he came\r\nwith Kidd from Madagascar, or ever saw him in his life; but Captain\r\nDavies,[8] who also came thence with Kidd, and all Kidd's men, are\r\npositive he is the man and that he went by his true name viz. Gillam,\r\nall the while he was on the voyage with them, and Mr. Campbel the\r\nPostmaster of this town (whom I sent to treat with Kidd) offers to\r\nswear this is the man he saw on [bo]ard Kidd's sloop under the name of\r\nJames Gillam. He is the most impudent hardened V[illai]n I ever saw\r\nin my whole life. That which led me to an Inquiry and search after\r\nthis man [was t]he Information of William Cuthbert on oath, which I\r\nsent your Lordships with my packet of the 26th of this last July,[9]\r\nwherein Cuthbert Informs that being lately in the East India Company's\r\nservice [it w]as commonly reported there that Gillam had killed\r\nCaptain Edgecomb with his own hand, that he had [s]erved the Mogul,\r\nturned Mahometan and was Circumcised. I had him searched by a\r\n[su]rgeon and also by a Jew in this Town, to know if he were\r\nCircumcised, and they have both declared on oath that he is. Mr.\r\nCutler the surgeon's[10] deposition goes (No. 1) and Mr. Frazon the\r\nJew's (No. 2).[11] The rest of the Evidences about Gillam and some\r\nother Pyrates go numbered from 3 to 23 inclusive, which I recommend to\r\nyour Lordships perusall, as what will inform you of the strange\r\nCountenance given to Pyrats by the Government and people of\r\n[Rhode]-Island. I have numbered the papers in order of time and\r\naccording to their dates: most have reference to Gillam, some to Kidd.\r\nIn searching the forementioned Captain Knot's house [a smal]l trunk\r\nwas found with some remnants of East India goods, and a Letter from\r\nKidd's wife to Captain Thomas Pain an old Pyrat living on Canonicot\r\nIsland in Rhode Island Governm[ent.][12] The affidavit he made when I\r\nwas at Rhode-Island goes numbered among the other evide[nce.] He then\r\nmade oath that he had received nothing from Kidd's sloop when she lay\r\nat anchor by [_torn_] Island, yet by Knot's deposition your Lordships\r\nwill find, he was sent with Mrs. Kidd's letter to Pa[in for] 24 ounces\r\nof gold, which Knot accordingly brought; and Mrs. Kidd's Injunction to\r\nPain to keep a[ll the] rest that was left with him till further order,\r\nwas a plain Indication that there was a good deal of [trea]sure still\r\nbehind in Pain's Custody, therefore I posted away a messenger to\r\nGovernor Crans[ton][13] and Colonel Sanford to make a strict search of\r\nPain's house before he could have notice; it see[ms] nothing was then\r\nfound, but Pain has since produced 18 ounces and odd weight of gold,\r\nas appears by Cranston's Letter of the 25th Instant and pretends it\r\nwas bestowed on him by Kidd, hoping that may p[rove (?)] a salvo for\r\nthe oath he made when I was in Rhode-Island, but I think it is plain\r\nhe forswore himselfe then, and I am of opinion he has a great deal\r\nmore of Kidd's gold still in his hands. [But] he is out of my power,\r\nand being in that Government I cannot compell him to deliver up th....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The letter in which no. 83 was enclosed; its substance is\r\ngiven in _Cal.

I see no reason why he should keep them ... so far from that,\r\nthat he (with submission) ought to be called to an account for\r\nConniving at the Py[rats] making that Island their Sanctuary, and\r\nsuffering some to escape from Justice. If there be an order sent to\r\nhim to deliver what gold and jewels is contained in the said\r\nInventory, and also the formentio[ned] parcel of gold which he\r\nreceived from Pain, with all other goods and treasure which he has at\r\nany time rec[eived] from Privateers or Pyrates, into my hands for the\r\nuse of his Majesty, and that upon oath, I will [see] the order\r\nexecuted, and will give a faithfull account thereof according to the\r\norder I shall re[ceive].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Nathaniel Coddington of Newport, register of the court\r\nof admiralty in Rhode Island.]\r\n\r\nFour pound weight of the gold brought from Gardiner's Island which I\r\nformerly acquainted your Lordships of, and all the Jewels, belonged\r\nto Gillam, as Mr. Gardiner's Letter to Mr. Dummer,[15] a Marchand in\r\nt[he] town and one of the Committee appointed by me and the Council to\r\nreceive all the treasure and goods which [were] brought in Kidd's\r\nsloop, will prove; and there is some proof of it in Captain\r\nCoddington's b[efore men]tioned narrative, and in Captain Knot's\r\ndeposition of the 14th Instant. I am told that as Vice A[dmiral] of\r\nthese provinces I am entitled to 1/3 part of Gillam's said gold and\r\nJewels; I know not whe[ther I] am or no, but if it be my right I hope\r\nyour Lordships will please to represent to the King the ext[reme]\r\npains and vigilance I have used in taking these severall Pyrates, and\r\nthat I may have my [por]tion of the said gold and Jewels, if there be\r\nany due to me. It is a great prejudice to the King's s[ervice] that\r\nhere is no Revenue or other fund to answer any occasion or service of\r\nMajestys. I have [been] forced to disburse the 200 pieces of 8/8 for\r\nthe taking of Gillam out of my own little stock and also to [de]fray\r\nmy journey and other expences in going to Rhode-Island to execute the\r\nKing's Commission [and] Instructions. Both accounts I now send, and\r\nbeg your Lordships favour in promoting and Countenancing the payment\r\nof that mony to Sir John Stanley for my use. Captain Gullock[16] tells\r\n[me] that 15 or 16 of the ship's Company that would not be concerned\r\nwith Gillam and his accomplices in murdering Captain Edgecomb, and\r\nafterwards turning Pyrates, went home to England in [the] Ship\r\n_America_ belonging to the East India Company, Captain Laycock\r\nCommander. I should thi[nk an] advertisement in the Gazette requiring\r\nsome of those men to appear before one of the Sec[retaries] of State\r\nto give their evidence of what they know of that matter, would be\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Jeremiah Dummer the elder, father of the publicist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Thomas Gullock was the captain of the ship which Bradish\r\nhad run away with. Sir John Stanley was an official of the lord\r\nchamberlain's office.]\r\n\r\n[Your] Lordships will meet with a passe among the other papers, number\r\n5, to Sion Arnold, one of the [pirat]es brought from Madagascar by\r\nShelley of New York, the said passe signed by Mr. Basse,[17]\r\n[Go]vernor of East and West Jerzies, which is a bold step in Basse\r\nafter such positive orders as he received from [Govern]or[18] Vernon,\r\nbut I perceive plainly the meaning of it, he took severall Pirats at\r\nBurlington [in West] Jerzey, and a good store of mony with them as it\r\nis said, and I daresay he would be glad they [should] escape, for when\r\nthey are gone, who can witnesse what money he seized with them? I know\r\n[the] man so well, that I verily believe that is his plot. John Carr\r\nmentioned in some of the [papers to (?)] be in Rhode Island, No. 6,\r\nwas one of Hore's Crew. There are abundance of other Pyrats in that\r\n[Is]land at this time, but they are out of my power. Mr. Brinley,[19]\r\nColonel Sanford, and Captain Coddington are honest men, and of the\r\nbest estates in the Island, and because they are heartily [wea]ry of\r\nthe male administrations of that Government, and because too I\r\ncommissioned them (by [virt]ue of the authority and power given me by\r\nhis Majesty's Commission and Instructions so to do) to [make] Inquiry\r\ninto the Irregularities of those people, they are become strangely\r\nodious to them and [are o]ften affronted by them, neither will they\r\nmake them Justices of the peace; so that when they [w]ould commit\r\nPyrates to Goal, they are forced to go to the Governor for his\r\nWarrant, and very ... ly the Pyrates get notice, and avoid the Warrant\r\nfor that time. You may please to o[bser]ve too that Gardiner the\r\nDeputy Collector[20] is accused to have been once a Pyrat, in one of\r\nthe [paper]s. I doubt he will forswear himselfe rather than part with\r\nGillam's gold which is in his hands. [It is] impossible for me to\r\ntransmit to the Lords of the Treasury these proofs against Gardiner.\r\n[I am] so jaded with writing, that I cannot write to them by this\r\nConveyance, but I could wish [your Lordships might be (?)] made\r\nacquainted with Gardiner's Character, and that they would send over\r\nhonest In----t men to be Collectors of Rhode Island, Conecticut, and\r\nNew Hampshire; and that they [would h]asten Mr. Brenton[21] hither to\r\nhis post, or send some other Collector in his room. I could [wish]\r\nthat Mr. Weaver were ordered to hasten to New York.

Kidd, I presume to make the following Answer, being the best and\r\nfullest I can make at present having neither my Books or papers in\r\nthis Kingdome.\r\n\r\nThat I was born in Worcestershire about the yeare 1672 and in the year\r\n1697 was Deputed by the Commissioners of his Maj'ties Customes for the\r\nLeeward Islands to be Collector for the Island of Antigua.\r\n\r\nThat in the year 1698 following I quitted that Imployment[2] and\r\nfollowed Merchandizing about the said Leeward Islands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: He was removed, and at the time of his removal he owed\r\nthe crown about L500. _Ibid._, p. 603.]\r\n\r\nThat in February 1698/9 I sailed from Antigua in the Sloop _St.\r\nAntonie_, Samuel Wood Master, on a Trading Voyage amongst the Dutch\r\nand Spaniards. The Markett at Curacoa (a Dutch Island) not answering\r\nmy Ends I went to Rio De la Hacha,[3] and there sold my Cargoe, and\r\nLoaded my Sloope with Stock Fish [and] Wood on Freight for Curacoa\r\naforesaid, which I there Landed and departed for the Island of Porto\r\nRico with intention to Trade with the Inhabitants of that Island,\r\nhaving a Cargo on Board for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: On the Spanish Main, or north coast of South America,\r\nabout 300 miles west of Curacao.]\r\n\r\nThat in that Voyage in the Moneth of Aprill 1699 being becalmed to the\r\nN.N.E. of the Island Mona the Men belonging to the Sloop discovered a\r\nSail E. and B.S.[4] from Mona which the Pilote of the Sloope supposed\r\nto be a Guarda Costa, a small vessell fitted out by the Spanish\r\nGovernors to clear the Coast of Foreign Traders. A few houres after\r\nWee discovered a Cannoa, which drawing near the Sloope, Wee hailed the\r\nsaid Cannoa. They answered from Whitehall. Wee demanded who Commanded\r\ntheir Shipp. They Replyed Capt. Kidd. Then he that stired[5] the\r\nCannoa was desired to come on Board. After he came he told me his name\r\nwas John Ware, and that he was Master of Capt. Kidd's Ship, requesting\r\nthat I would goe on Board in the Cannoa to see Capt. Kidd which\r\naccordingly I did. When I came there Captain Kidd askt me to sell him\r\nmy Sloope in regard his Ship was disabled and could not well proceed\r\nthe voyage he intended for New Yorke, and finding me unwilling he then\r\naskt if I could not procure him a Vessell. I answered possibly I might\r\nat Curacao, upon which he desired me to use my Endeavors there to get\r\nhim a Sloope, and procure him some Buyers or Chapmen[6] for his\r\nCalicos and Muslings, And that he would consider me for my paynes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: East and by south, _i.e._, midway between east and\r\neastsoutheast.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Steered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _I.e._, Some customers or some selling agents.]\r\n\r\nThat thereupon I departed from Capt. Kidd and went for Curacao where I\r\napplyed my selfe to Mr John Stonehouse and Mr Walter Gribble[7]\r\n(Acquaintance of Captain Kidd) who promised to send A Sloope to him. I\r\nalso Endeavored to procure him some Buyers for the Muslings and\r\nCallicos.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See doc. no. 76, note 21.]\r\n\r\nThat after doing my Errand and business at Curacao I ordered the\r\nMaster of the Sloope to shape his Course for the West End of Porto\r\nRico, But the Wind proving Northerly Wee fell in with the East end of\r\nSavona and plyed to Winward for Mona in order to meet Captain Kidd,\r\nwhich I there did according to Appointm't and with him a Dutch Sloope,\r\nJean Vander Bist Master, and a French Turtler, the Master's name I\r\nhave forgot; Captain Kidd waited at Mona for the Curacao vessells But\r\nthe Wind being about No. and from thence to NNE they could not\r\npossibly Fetch Mona, So Captain Kidd's patience being tyred gott his\r\nship under Saile and intended to Weather point Esperdo,[8] the\r\nEastermost part of Hispaniola, but the Deficiencies of his Ship being\r\nso great he bore away for the West end of Savona, and there Anchored.\r\na Day or two afterwards came into Our Company the Brigandin _Mary\r\nGold_, George Lorriston Master, and the _Elenora_, John Duncan Master.\r\nThen Cap't Kidd weighed Anchor with the sloop _Spey_, John Vander Bist\r\nMaster, and Brigandine _Mary Gold_, sailed for the River Higuey in the\r\nIsland Hispaniola where Arriving he moored his ship across the River\r\nto the Stumps of Trees or Rocks on shoar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Punta Espada.]\r\n\r\nThat there Capt. Kidd disposed of wine, part of his Cargoe, to\r\nseverall that came on Board to him And that at the same time I sold\r\nhim the Sloope _St. Antonio_.\r\n\r\nThat Capt. Kidd tooke severall Goods out of his ship, and put them on\r\nBoard the Sloope I sould him and left his owne ship in the River\r\nHiguey and desired me to doe him all the service I could in selling\r\nand disposeing of the Goods left on Board of the said ship for Account\r\nof the Owners of the _Adventure Galley_.\r\n\r\nThat Captain Kidd told me that my Lord Bellomont and my Lord of\r\nOrford[9] and himselfe were some of the _Adventure Galleys_ owners and\r\nto the best of my Remembrance Sir John Somers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Sir Edward Russell of doc. no. 71, note 1. He had\r\nbeen created earl of Orford in 1697.]\r\n\r\nThat Capt. Kidd shewed me a Commission under the Great Seale signed at\r\nthe Topp William Rex and another Commission signed by the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, the purport of neither of which I can remember, onely Capt.\r\nKidd sayd his Commissions impowred him to take pirates and the\r\nsubjects of the French King.\r\n\r\nThat Capt. Kidd at his going to New Yorke promised to return himselfe\r\nor send some other persons in two Moneths time to bring Necessaryes\r\nfor refitting his said ship the _Adventure Prize_ and also a\r\nCondemnation for the said ship and Goods and to indempnifye all\r\npersons that should purchase any of the said Goods, alledging that the\r\nsaid ship was a lawfull prize being taken with a French passe which\r\nCaptain Kidd shewed me, and actually in the time of War with\r\nFrance.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See doc. no. 76, note 9.]\r\n\r\nThat after the Departure of Capt. Kidd the Seamen shiped by him in the\r\nsaid ship did plunder and convert to their owne uses the best and most\r\nchoicest of the goods of the said ships Cargoe, which did not come to\r\nmy Knowledge till they had been near Five Weeks on board the said\r\nship, and indeed it was out of my power to prevent them had I\r\ndiscovered it sooner being only myselfe and Negro Boy, And they were\r\nEighteen in numbers.\r\n\r\nThat the said Seamen belonging to the said ship as afores'd when they\r\nfound I was not ignorant of their villanies openly declared they would\r\nnot stay longer on board the said ship, but being terrified with the\r\nthoughts of Capt Kidds returning, they Joyned all (saving the\r\nBoatswaine) and came on the Quarter Deck and said I might remain in\r\nthe ship and be damned for they would stay no longer. The Man that\r\nthus affronted me I shoved on the main Deck[11] and ordered the rest\r\nto go on the Main Deck likewise and told them they had engaged\r\nthemselves to Capt. Kidd to stay on board the ship as long as I should\r\nbe there, And that I was resolved to stay till the two Months in which\r\nCapt. Kidd promised to return were expired unless some Extraordinary\r\nAccident intervened: I also charged them with stealing out of the\r\nShips Hould severall Bales of Goods And that if they went from the\r\nShip before Capt. Kidd's Arrivall I was oblidged as his Friend and in\r\nmy owne Justification to write to all Governm'ts in those parts to\r\nhave them secured; this calmed them for two or three dayes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _I.e._, shoved down from the quarter-deck onto the main\r\ndeck.]\r\n\r\nThat the said Seamen did again Joyne and draw up a Paper directed to\r\nme setting forth their Resolution of leaving the Ship and signed with\r\ntheir names within a Circle commonly called a Round Robin, so gott on\r\nboard A Sloope and went for the Island Curacao leaving the Ship to me\r\nand three more.\r\n\r\nThat after the departure of the said Seamen I stayd about a Week in\r\nthe ship and would have stayed longer had not a Friend of myne sent a\r\nSloope Express from Curacao to informe me the Spaniards of the Citty\r\nof St. Domingo[12] were arming out a Brigandine to come and take us,\r\nwhich induced me to leave the said ship _Adventure Prize_ in the said\r\nRiver Higuey and went to the Island Curacao in order to protest ag't\r\nthe Seamen as aforesaid and to get what satisfaction the Law would\r\nallow, For at that time they had most of them three or Four hundred\r\npounds a Man. But the said Seamen had gained their Ends so farr in the\r\nGovernm't that the Governor would not admitt me to stay in Curacao\r\ntho' at the same time John Ware Master of Capt. Kidd's ship and the\r\nsaid seamen were there openly protected; I do not charge this on the\r\nGovern'r[13] (who is since dead) For I should be very sorry to\r\ndisturbe the Ashes of so good a Gentleman as I believe he was, but on\r\nsome of his Councill that did not desire I should face them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Not a hundred miles away.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Bastiaen (Sebastian) Bernage.]\r\n\r\nThat I have not received of the produce of the Goods Capt. Kidd left\r\nupwards of three hundred and Eighty peices of Eight, all the rest is\r\nin Debts outstanding which is much less than my Charges.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: But John Ruggles, master's mate of the _Primrose_ of\r\nBoston, testified that, drinking in a public house at Charles Town,\r\nNevis, with William Cheesers and William Daniel, he heard the former\r\nsay that Bolton had got L16,000 by Captain Kidd. _Cal. St. P. Col._,\r\n1699, p. 416.]\r\n\r\nThis is the full that presents to my Memory in Answer to their Lord'ps\r\nDemands February 4th, 1700.\r\n\r\nHEN. BOLTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_87. William Kidd to the Speaker of the House of Commons (Robert\r\nHarley). April (?), 1701._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the manuscripts of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck\r\nAbbey. The Historical Manuscripts Commission's calendar of those\r\narchives, IV. 16, wrongly gives this petition the same date as the\r\nnext document, May 12, 1701. This petition was written before the\r\ntrials, which occurred on May 8 and 9, but after Kidd's appearances\r\nbefore the House of Commons, which occurred on Mar. 27 and 31;\r\n_Commons Journal_, XIII. 441, 463. Kidd, Gillam, Bradish, Witherley,\r\nand 28 other pirates, mostly members of Kidd's crew, were shipped from\r\nBoston soon after March 6, 1700 (eight months after his arrest), on\r\nthe _Advice_ frigate, and arrived in the Downs Apr. 11, the day on\r\nwhich King William brought to an end, by prorogation, the session of\r\nParliament. In that session, chiefly as a means of attacking Somers,\r\nthe lord chancellor, a party in the House of Commons had assailed the\r\ngrant of letters patent under which Kidd's enterprise had been\r\nundertaken (Dec. 6, 1699). They were outvoted, but on Mar. 16, 1700, a\r\nvote was passed for addressing the king that Kidd should not be tried,\r\ndischarged, or pardoned till the next session of Parliament. The\r\nAdmiralty concurred, May 2. The new Parliament came together Feb. 6,\r\n1701; Harley was chosen speaker Feb. 11; the impeachment of Somers and\r\nOrford, in which the contract with Kidd was made the basis of one\r\narticle, was voted Apr. 14.]\r\n\r\n_May it please Y'r Hon'r_\r\n\r\nThe long Imprisonment I have undergone, or the tryall I am to\r\nundergoe, are not soe great an affliction to me, as my not being able\r\nto give your Hon'ble House of Commons such satisfaction as was\r\nExpected from me. I hope I have not offended against the Law, but if I\r\nhave, It was the fault of others who knew better, and made me the Tool\r\nof their Ambition and Avarice, and who now perhaps think it their\r\nInterest that I should be removed out of the world.\r\n\r\nI did not seek the Commission I undertook, but was partly Cajold, and\r\npartly menac'd into it by the Lord Bellomont, and one Robert\r\nLivingston of New York, who was the projector, promoter, and Chief\r\nManager of that designe, and who only can give your House a\r\nsatisfactory account of all the Transactions of my Owners. He was the\r\nman admitted into their Closets, and received their private\r\nInstructions, which he kept in his own hands, and who encouraged me in\r\ntheir names to doe more than I ever did, and to act without regard to\r\nmy Commission. I would not Exceed my Authority, and took noe other\r\nships than such as had French passes, which I brought with me to New\r\nEngland, and relyed upon for my Justification. But my Lord Bellomont\r\nseized upon them together with my Cargoe, and tho he promised to send\r\nthem into England, yet has he detained part of the effects, kept these\r\npasses wholly from me, and has stript me of all the Defence I have to\r\nmake, which is such Barbarous, as well as dishonorable usage, as I\r\nhope Your Hon'ble House will not let an Englishman suffer, how\r\nunfortunate soever his Circumstances are; but will intercede with his\r\nMaj'ty to defer my tryall till I can have those passes, and that\r\nLivingston may be brought under Your Examination, and Confronted by\r\nme.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Whether the presence of the French passes at the trial\r\nfor piracy would have brought about Kidd's acquittal may be doubted,\r\ncourts of justice being what they were; at all events Kidd, though he\r\nclamored for them from the day of his arrival in the Downs (_Portland\r\nMSS._, VIII. 78) till the day he was sentenced, was never able to\r\nrecover them. The admiralty court refused to consider them. \"Where are\r\nthey?\" said the Lord Chief Baron Ward. Kidd's counsel could only\r\nreply, \"We cannot yet tell whether they are in the Admiralty-Office,\r\nor whether Mr. Jodrell [clerk of the House of Commons] hath them\".\r\n_State Trials_, V. 290. In point of fact the House of Commons, which\r\nhad had all the papers before it for examination, had on Apr. 16, on\r\ninformation that Kidd desired the use of his papers at his trial,\r\nordered the clerk to deliver them to the secretary of the Admiralty.\r\n_Commons Journal_, XIII. 379, 380, 496.--A photographic facsimile of\r\nthe pass of the _Cara_ (_Quedah_) _Merchant_ is in Paine, _Book of\r\nBuried Treasure_, at p. 104.]\r\n\r\nI cannot be so unjust to my selfe, as to plead to an Indictment till\r\nthe French passes are restored to me, unlesse I would be accessary to\r\nmy own destruction,[3] for though I can make proof that the ships I\r\ntook had such passes, I am advised by Council, that It will little\r\navail me without producing the passes themselves. I was in great\r\nConsternation when I was before that great Assembly, Your Hon'ble\r\nHouse, which with the disadvantages of a mean Capacity, want of\r\nEducation, and a Spirit Cramped by Long Confinem't, made me Uncapable\r\nof representing my Case; and I have therefore presumed to send your\r\nHonor a short and true state of It, which I humbly beg Your Honors\r\nperusall, and Communication of to the House, if you think it worthy\r\ntheir Notice.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: So when first arraigned, he tried to avoid pleading\r\n(_ibid._, 287), but he was tried first for the murder of William\r\nMoore, on which the passes had no bearing. William Moore was an\r\ninsubordinate gunner; after an altercation, Kidd hit him on the head\r\nwith a bucket, and he died. It was probably manslaughter, but the jury\r\nsustained the indictment for murder. After being condemned for murder,\r\nKidd was tried (unfairly in several particulars) and condemned for\r\npiracy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Not doc. no. 88, I judge, but more probably the \"Protest\"\r\nprinted in _Portland MSS._, VIII. 78-80, a statement of Kidd's case\r\nwhich he had drawn up at Boston and on arrival in the Downs had sent\r\nto Orford.]\r\n\r\nI humbly crave leave to acquaint Your Honor that I was not privy to my\r\nbeing sent for up to Your House the second time, nor to the paper\r\nlately printed in my name[5] (both which may justly give Offence to\r\nthe House) but I owe the first to a Coffeeman in the Court of Wards\r\nwho designed to make a shew of me, for his profit; and the latter was\r\ndone by one Newy a prisoner in Newgate to get money for his support,\r\nat the hazard of my safety.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: I cannot identify this paper (probably a broadside), but\r\nthe ingenious Newy was doubtless the author of _Captain Charles Newy's\r\nCase, impartially laid open: or a ...

Fletcher, which I\r\nsuppose may be a more particular accot. then any your Excell'y may\r\nreceive. he ad's that the Pirates boasted much of their great strength\r\nby sea, and that there were sufficient of them to repell any force\r\nthat would be sent against them, and used many enticements to perswade\r\nhis men to goe with them: and I Doubt it will be impossible to secure\r\nthe Navigation to and from this Country, and stop their Piraticall\r\nInvations, without a greater force. Capt. Fletcher haveing lost his\r\nCertificate, Cocquetts, and Register, cannot be entered and suffered\r\nto Load without your Excellys order. the ship hath used this Place\r\nmany Years: and this Master in her last Year produced his\r\nCertificates, Cocquets, and Register, all which are in my booke of\r\nEntryes:[2] he hath the same Owners and [as?] the ships here. his\r\nTownsmen will refitt him and hath his Loading and Tobacco ready: and\r\nit would be severe if his misfortune should Doubly injure him. besides\r\nit would prejudice his Majestys revenue to forbid him to Load,\r\ntherefore suppose if he gives Security to unload in England he may be\r\npermitted to trade: if your Excellency think fitt. I lay wind bound\r\nand [at (?)] Mr. Mekennies at Elizabeth River, and on Sunday last\r\nafternoon we saw a ship come in: and imediatly the _Shoreham_ loosed\r\nand went to turn out of the River, when we Crossing over to Castle\r\npoint[3] Mr. Makennie spoke with Capt. Passenger, who told him a Pirat\r\nhad pursued that ship and taken others and desired we would not\r\nadventure into the Bay but lye at the Poynt. next morning early we saw\r\nCap. Passenger on the back of the horshooe,[4] standing Down towards 3\r\nships in Lyn haven bay, who when he came up with them fired upon him,\r\nand the Pyrate imediately gott to sail and stood directly with Capt.\r\nPassenger, who got the weather gage, and Imediatly followed as sharp a\r\nDispute as (I thinke) could be betwixt two ships, of which we were\r\nfull spectators Dureing the whole engagement: and in my Judgment Capt.\r\nPassenger behaved himself with much Courage and good Conduct, haveing\r\nto Deal with an Enemy under a Desperate choice of killing or hanging,\r\nand I believe few men in their circumstances but would elect the\r\nfirst. the Conflict briskly maintained from soon after sunrise untill\r\nabout 4 afternoon. on thursday May the second Fletcher gott in here\r\nand gave the inclosed accot.,[5] which I beleive much Imports his\r\nMaj'tes service and Interest, least thinking the Pirate aforesaid\r\nmight be all, security would Endanger many ships. Fletcher further\r\nsaies these are not of them who tooke Burgis last Year but others, and\r\nperhaps more may come upon the same accot. as these doe. I suppose\r\nyour Excelly will think fitt to lay on a Gen'll Embargoe untill some\r\nAssureance that the Coast is Clear: and believe York River will be\r\nmore Convenient then James River, in Regard ships must goe to the Cape\r\nto Clear the horshooe before they can gett into James River, and soe\r\nmay be Endangered. I wait your Excellys Order and Directions and\r\nwithall to favour me with a true relation of the success of the\r\nAction betwixt Capt.

Finally the pirate, with all masts\r\nand sails shattered, drifted aground. Then, having laid a train to\r\nthirty barrels of gunpowder, he threatened to blow the ship up, and\r\nthe governor, to save the lives of the forty or fifty English\r\nprisoners, gave quarter, promising to refer the pirates to the king's\r\nmercy if they should surrender quietly. So 111 of them were sent to\r\nEngland in the _Essex Prize_ and the fleet of merchantmen convoyed by\r\nher, June 9. The trial was of three who were brought in without having\r\nbeen included in the surrender. It was held, in accordance with the\r\nVirginian act, by a commission of oyer and terminer, appointed by the\r\ngovernor. All three of them were hanged, although \"One of them,\r\nCornelius Frank, said, Must I be hanged that can speake all\r\nLanguages\"? Another curious passage in the trial deserves to be\r\nquoted: \"_Mr. Atty. Gen._ Did the Pyrates talk of blowing their Shipp\r\nup? _Ed.

June 30, 1704._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: What is here reproduced, to show somewhat of the\r\nharrowing circumstances under which the pirate's career might end, is\r\na very rare \"extra\" of the _Boston News-Letter_, found in the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society's file of that newspaper. The case of\r\nQuelch and his associates is related in much detail by Mr. A.C.\r\nGoodell in the _Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts\r\nBay_, VIII. 386-398, and in the _Publications_ of the Colonial Society\r\nof Massachusetts, III. 71-77. The pursuit of the pirates is described\r\nin Sewall's diary, with extracts from the _News-Letter_, in Mass.\r\nHist. Soc., _Collections_, XLVI. 103-110. In August, 1703, the\r\nbrigantine _Charles_, fitted out as a privateer to cruise against the\r\nFrench, was riding off Marblehead, with her captain lying too sick to\r\ntake her to sea. The crew seized the ship, put it in command of\r\nQuelch, threw the captain overboard, and sailed for the coast of\r\nBrazil, where for some months they engaged in a profitable career of\r\npiracy at the expense of subjects of the King of Portugal, with whom\r\nEngland had just concluded a particularly close alliance. In May,\r\n1704, they reappeared on the Massachusetts coast, landed, and\r\ndispersed, but were presently suspected, accused, proclaimed, and\r\n\"rounded up\", the main capture being made at the Isles of Shoals, by\r\nan armed force under Maj. Stephen Sewall, the diarist's brother. The\r\ntrial, June 13, 16, 19-21, was the first held in New England under the\r\nact of Parliament 11 and 12 Will. III., ch. 7, which gave the crown\r\nauthority to issue commissions for the trial of pirates by specially\r\nconstituted courts, outside the realm of England. The governor, Joseph\r\nDudley, presided. Mr. Goodell maintains that the trial was conducted\r\nillegally in important particulars. Of the six pirates named above, as\r\nexecuted on June 30, Lambert was a Salem man, Peterson apparently a\r\nSwede, Roach Irish, Quelch and the other two English. Judge Sewall\r\nrecords that \"When the Scaffold was let to sink, there was such a\r\nScreech of the Women that my wife heard it sitting in our Entry next\r\nthe Orchard, and was much surprised at it; yet the wind was sou-west.\r\nOur house is a full mile from the place.\" In 1835 the editor's\r\ngrandfather saw the six pirates of the _Mexican_, almost the last of\r\ntheir profession, hanged at about the same spot. I find that Mr. Paine\r\nhas printed this piece, in _Buried Treasure_, but I know no other that\r\nso well illustrates its particular aspect of our theme.]\r\n\r\nAn Account of the Behaviour and Last Dying Speeches Of the Six\r\nPirates, that were Executed on Charles River, Boston side, on Fryday,\r\nJune 30th, 1704. _Viz._, Capt. John Quelch, John Lambert, Christopher\r\nScudamore, John Miller, Erasmus Peterson and Peter Roach.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers of the Town had used more than ordinary Endeavours, to\r\nInstruct the Prisoners, and bring them to Repentance. There were\r\nSermons Preached in their hearing, Every day,[2] And Prayers daily\r\nmade with them. And they were Catachised; and they had many occasional\r\nExhortations. And nothing was left, that could be done for their Good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: One of the sermons preached by Cotton Mather to the\r\nunfortunate men was printed by him this year under the title _Faithful\r\nWarnings to prevent Fearful Judgments_.]\r\n\r\nOn Fryday the 20th [30th] of June 1704, Pursuant to Orders in the Dead\r\nWarrant, the aforesaid Pirates were guarded from the Prison in Boston,\r\nby Forty Musketeers, Constables of the Town, the Provost Marshal and\r\nhis Officers, etc. with Two Ministers,[3] who took great pains to\r\nprepare them for the last Article of their Lives. Being allowed to\r\nwalk on Foot through the Town, to Scarlets Wharff,[4] where, the\r\nSilver Oar being carried before them, they went by Water to the place\r\nof Execution, being Crowded and thronged on all sides with Multitudes\r\nof Spectators. The Ministers then Spoke to the Malefactors, to this\r\nEffect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Rev. Thomas Bridge of the First Church, and Cotton Mather\r\nof the Second.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: At the foot of Fleet Street, near the present South\r\nFerry. Thus the grim procession went around most of the water front of\r\nthe town. Sewall says his cousin counted 150 boats full of spectators\r\nof the execution, besides the multitude on land. The silver oar was\r\nthe emblem of the admiralty.]\r\n\r\n\"We have told you often, ye[a] we have told you Weeping, That you have\r\nby Sin undone your selves; That you were born Sinners, That you have\r\nlived Sinners, That your Sins have been many and mighty, and that the\r\nSins for which you are now to Dy are of no common aggravation. We have\r\ntold you, That there is a Saviour for Sinners, and we have shewn you,\r\nhow to commit your selves into His Saving and Healing Hands. We have\r\ntold you, That if He Save you, He will give you an hearty Repentance\r\nfor all your Sins, and we have shown you how to Express that\r\nRepentance. We have told you, What Marks of Life must be desired for\r\nyour Souls, that you may Safely appear before the Judgment Seat of\r\nGod. Oh! That the means used for your Good may by the Grace of God be\r\nmade Effectual. We can do no more, but leave you in His Merciful\r\nHands!\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone up upon the Stage, and Silence was Commanded, One\r\nof the Ministers Prayed, as followeth.\r\n\r\nThe Prayer made by One of the Ministers, after the Malefactors were\r\nfirst upon the Stage.[5] (As near as it could be taken in Writing in\r\nthe great Crowd.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This prayer is unmistakable Cotton Mather; to whom we may\r\nbe sure this whole occasion was one of extraordinary enjoyment.]\r\n\r\n\"O Thou most Great and Glorious Lord! Thou art a Righteous, and a\r\nTerrible God. It is a Righteous and an Holy Law that thou hast given\r\nunto us. To break that Good Law, and Sin against thy Infinite Majesty,\r\ncan be no little Evil. Thy Word is always True; and very Particular,\r\nthat Word of thine which has told us and warn'd us, _Evil Pursueth\r\nSinners_. We have seen it, we have seen it; We have before our Eyes a\r\ndreadful Demonstration of it. Oh! Sanctify unto us a Sight that has in\r\nit so much of the Terror of the Lord! We have Reason to Glorify the\r\nFree Grace of God, that we are not our selves the Instances. We have\r\nbefore us very astonishing Examples of _Evil Pursuing Sinners_. Here\r\nis a Number of men that have been very Great Sinners, and that are to\r\nDy before their Time, for their being wicked overmuch. God knows the\r\nPrayers, the Pains, the Tears, and the Agonies that have been Employ'd\r\nfor them. And now, the Last Thing that we have to do for them, is to\r\npour out with Anguish of Soul our Prayer on their behalf; Our Prayer,\r\nto that God, who heareth Prayer; to that God, with whom there is Mercy\r\nand Plenteous Redemption; to that God, who is Rich in Mercy and Ready\r\nto Pardon. But how can we make our Prayer, without a Rapturous\r\nAdoration of that Free-Grace, which has distinguished us! We, even we\r\nalso, have every one of us an horrible Fountain of Sin in our Souls.\r\nThere are none of the Crimes committed by these Miserable Men, or by\r\nthe worst of those Criminals that go down into the Pit, but we have\r\nthe seeds of them, in that Original Corruption, which we brought into\r\nthe World with us. If God had left us to our selves, as He justly\r\nmight have done, there is not the best among us all, but what would\r\nsoon have done the worst things in the World. Oh! The Free-Grace! Oh!\r\nThe Free-Grace! Oh! The Riches of that Grace, which has made all the\r\nDifference! But now, we Cry mightily to Heaven, we Lift up our Cries\r\nto the God of all Grace, for the Perishing Souls which are just now\r\ngoing to Expire under the Stroke of Justice, before our Eyes. We\r\nMourn, we Mourn, that upon some of them, at Least, we do unto this\r\nMinute see no better Symptomes. But, Oh! is there not yet a Room for\r\nSovereign Grace to be display'd, in their Conversion and Salvation!\r\nThey Perish, if they do not now Sincerely Turn from Sin to God, and\r\ngive themselves up to the Lord Jesus Christ; They Righteously and\r\nHorribly Perish! And yet, without influences from above, they can do\r\nnone of those things which must be done if they do not perish. Oh! Let\r\nus beg it of our God, that He would not be so Provoked at their\r\nMultiplied and Prodigious Impieties, and at their obstinate Hardness\r\nunder means of Good formerly afforded them, as to withhold those\r\nInfluences from them! We cry to thee, O God of all Grace, That thou\r\nwouldest not Suffer them to continue in the Gall of Bitterness and\r\nBond of Iniquity, and in the Possession of the Devil. Oh! Knock off\r\nthe Chains of Death which are upon their Souls; Oh! Snatch the prey\r\nout of the Hands of the Terrible.\r\n\r\n\"Yet once again! Once again! We bring them, and lay them before the\r\nSpirit of Grace. O Almighty Spirit of Grace, May these Poor, blind,\r\nmad Sinners become objects for the Triumphs of Grace! O Almighty\r\nSpirit of God, and of Grace, cause these poor men to see their own\r\nSinfulness and Wretchedness! Make them willing to be Saved from such\r\nSinfulness and Wretchedness; Discover to them the only Saviour of\r\ntheir Souls. Oh! Dispose them, Oh! Assist them to give the Consent of\r\ntheir Souls unto His Wonderful Proposals. Let them Dy, Renouncing all\r\nDependence on any Righteousness of their own; Alas, what can they have\r\nof their own to Depend upon! As a Token and Effect of their having\r\nAccepted the Righteousness of God, Let them heartily Repent of all\r\ntheir Sins against thee, and Abhor and cast up every Morsel of their\r\nIniquity. Oh! Let them not go out of the World, raging and raving\r\nagainst the Justice of God and Man; And whatever part of the Satanick\r\nImage is yet remaining on their Souls, Oh! Efface it! Let them now Dy\r\nin such a State and such a Frame, as may render them fit to appear\r\nbefore God the Judge of all. What shall we do for them? What shall\r\nplead for them?\r\n\r\n\"Great God, Grant that all the Spectators may get Good by the horrible\r\nSpectacle that is now before them! Let all the People hear and fear,\r\nand let no more any such Wickedness be done, as has produced this\r\nwoful Spectacle. And let all the People beware how they go on in the\r\nWays of Sin, and in the pathes of the Destroyer, after so Solemn\r\nWarnings; Lest thou shouldest not only leave them to the grossest Acts\r\nof Wickedness, but also give them up unto the most amazing\r\nImpenitency, when the Punishment of their Iniquity comes to be\r\ninflicted on them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! but shall our Sea faring Tribe, on this Occasion, be in a\r\nSingular manner affected with the Warnings of God! Lord, May those of\r\nour dear Brethren be Saved from the Temptations which do so threaten\r\nthem! so ruine them! Oh! let them not Abandon themselves to Profanity,\r\nto Swearing, to Cursing, to Drinking, to Leudness, to a cursed\r\nForgetfulness of their Maker, and of the End for which He made them!\r\nOh! Let them not be abandoned of God, unto those Courses that will\r\nhasten them to a Damnation that slumbers not. Oh! Let the men fear the\r\nLord Exceedingly, We Pray thee! We Pray thee! Let the Condition of the\r\nSix or Seven men, whom they now see Dying for their Wickedness upon\r\nthe Sea, be Sanctified unto them.\r\n\r\n\"And now, we fly, we fly to _Sovereign Grace_. Oh! that the Poor men,\r\nwhich are immediately to appear before the awful Tribunal of God, may\r\nfirst by _Sovereign Grace_ have produced upon their Souls those Marks\r\nof thy Favour, without which tis a dreadful Thing to appear before\r\nthat awful Tribunal. Oh! Great God, Let thy _Sovereign Grace_ Operate\r\non this fearful Occasion! God be Merciful to us all, for the Sake of\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom with the Father and the Spirit, be\r\nascribed the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, for ever more, _Amen_.\"\r\n\r\nThey then Severally Spoke, Viz.\r\n\r\nI. _Capt. John Quelch._ The last Words he spake to One of the\r\nMinisters at his going up the Stage, were, \"I am not afraid of Death,\r\nI am not afraid of the Gallows, but I am afraid of what follows; I am\r\nafraid of a Great God, and a Judgment to Come.\" But he afterwards\r\nseem'd to brave it out too much against that fear: also when on the\r\nStage first he pulled off his Hat, and bowed to the Spectators, and\r\nnot Concerned, nor behaving himself so much like a Dying man as some\r\nwould have done. The Ministers had, in the Way to his Execution, much\r\ndesired him to Glorify God at his Death, by bearing a due Testimony\r\nagainst the Sins that had ruined him, and for the ways of Religion\r\nwhich he had much neglected: yet now being called upon to speak what\r\nhe had to say, it was but thus much; \"Gentlemen, 'Tis but little I\r\nhave to speak; What I have to say is this, I desire to be informed for\r\nwhat I am here. I am Condemned only upon Circumstances.

Though Dudley's commissions as\r\ngovernor confined his civil authority to Massachusetts and New\r\nHampshire, his commission as vice-admiral (printed in the\r\n_Publications_ of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, II. 220-224)\r\ngave him authority in Rhode Island also. The assembly of that colony,\r\nhowever, claimed the right under their charter to erect admiralty\r\ncourts of their own, and for their governor the right to commission\r\nprivateers. Queen Anne wrote to them in March 1704, repealing their\r\nact erecting a court, but they held that her letter did not forbid the\r\ncommissioning of privateers.

Commission for Trial of Piracy. November 1, 1716._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Charleston, Records of the Court of Vice-admiralty of\r\nSouth Carolina, vol. A-B. The document is spread upon the records of\r\nthe court for Nov. 27, 1716, at the beginning of the day's\r\nproceedings. This commission is a peculiar one. As has been explained\r\nin note 2 to doc. no. 51 and in note 1 to doc. no. 104, the act 28\r\nHenr. VIII. ch. 15 (1536) provided for the trial of piracy by\r\ncommissions specially appointed for the purpose, and with a jury, but\r\ndid not extend to the oversea plantations, while the act 11 and 12\r\nWill. III. ch. 7 (1699-1700) extended to those dominions the crown's\r\nauthority to appoint such commissions. Before the passage of the\r\nlatter statute, colonial governors had as vice-admirals appointed such\r\ncommissions, which had then proceeded under the civil (Roman) law, and\r\nnot under the statute. But South Carolina had in 1712 expressly\r\nadopted the act of 28 Henr. VIII. (Cooper, _Statutes at Large_, II.\r\n470) and here we have a commission issued by the deputy governor and\r\ncouncil, under authority of the proprietors of Carolina, for trial\r\nunder the act of 1536, though action could have been taken under that\r\nof 1700. The accused persons for whose trial the commission was issued\r\nwere acquitted. For the whole subject of piracy in or near Carolina,\r\nwhere it was rife in these years, see S.C. Hughson, \"The Carolina\r\nPirates and Colonial Commerce\", in _Johns Hopkins University Studies_,\r\nXII.

Cyprian Southack to Governor Samuel Shute. May [5?], 1717._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mass. Archives, vol. 51, pp. 287, 287a. Cyprian Southack\r\nwas a notable sea-captain and pilot. For a number of years he\r\ncommanded the naval vessel of Massachusetts, so that it was the\r\nnatural course for the governor to send him in pursuit of pirates who\r\nsuddenly appeared on the Massachusetts coast. In 1711 he had commanded\r\na vessel in the unfortunate expedition against Quebec under Sir\r\nHovenden Walker, and the admiral had stayed at his house during his\r\nlong detention in Boston. He was also the most noted map-maker of his\r\ntime in New England; in 1694 King William had admitted him to kiss his\r\nhands and had given him a gold chain of L50 for his map of\r\nNewfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the St. Lawrence region (_Acts. P.C.\r\nCol._, II. 264). The governor whom he addresses was Samuel Shute,\r\ngovernor 1716-1727. The ending of the War of the Spanish Succession\r\n(1713) had as usual caused a large revival of piracy, many privateers\r\nturning to that trade. The career of the _Whidah_ and of Capt. Samuel\r\nBellamy can be made out from the depositions which follow. On April\r\n26, in a heavy gale, she had come ashore on the sands of Cape Cod, in\r\nwhat is now Wellfleet, and all on board but two men (see doc. no. 114)\r\nwere drowned. More than a hundred of the pirates thus perished. Of\r\nthose who escaped wreck, in the smaller vessels, several, who had\r\nconstituted the prize crew of the _Mary Anne_ (doc. no. 109), were\r\ncaptured, tried, and executed (doc. no. 112). The story is told in\r\n_The Trials of Eight Persons Indited for Piracy_, etc. (Boston, 1718),\r\nand by Mr. John H. Edmonds in the _Boston Sunday Globe_ for Oct. 22,\r\n1916.]\r\n\r\nCAPE COD HARBOUR[2] May [5?] 1717\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Southack had come across from Boston into the inner side\r\nof the Cape.]\r\n\r\n_Maye itt Pleass Your Excellency_\r\n\r\n_Sir_, may 2 at 1 After noon I Came to Anchor here, finding Serveral\r\nVessells, Visseted them and on board one of them found a Yung man\r\nboling[3] to the Ship the Pirritt[4] Took 26 April in South Channell,\r\nSaileing from Nantaskett the Day before at 3 After noon.

About a year agoe he belonged\r\nto a Ship commanded by Captain Kingston, which in her voyage with\r\nLogwood to Holland was taken to the Leeward of the Havana by two\r\nPiratical Sloops, one commanded by Hornygold[2] and the other by a\r\nFrenchman called Leboose,[3] each having 70 men on board. The pirats\r\nkept the Ship about 8 or 10 daies, and then having taken out off her\r\nwhat they thought proper delivered her back to some of the men, who\r\nbelonged to her. Leboose kept the Examinate on board his Sloop about 4\r\nmonths, the English Sloop under Hornigolds command keeping company\r\nwith them all that time. Off Cape Corante[4] they took two Spanish\r\nBriganteens without any resistance, laden with cocoa from Ma[l]aca.\r\nThe Spaniards, not coming up to the pirats demand about the ransom,\r\nwere put ashoar and their Briganteens burn'd. They sailled next to the\r\nIsle of Pines, where meeting with three or four English Sloops empty,\r\nthey made use of them in cleaning their own, and gave them back. From\r\nthence they sailled in the latter end of May to Hispaniola, where they\r\ntarried about 3 months. The Examinate then left Leboose and went on\r\nboard the Sloop commanded formerly by Hornygold, but at that time by\r\none Bellamy, who upon a difference arising amongst the English Pirats\r\nbecause Hornygold refused to take and plunder English Vessels, was\r\nchosen by a great majority their Captain, and Hornygold departed with\r\n26 hands in a Prize Sloop, Bellamy having then on board about 90 men,\r\nmost of them English. Bellamy and Leboose sailled to the Virgin\r\nIslands and took several small fishing boats, and off St. Croix a\r\nFrench Ship laden with flower and fish from Canada, and having taken\r\nout some of the flower gave back the Ship. Plying to the Windward the\r\nmorning they made Saba[5] they spy'd two Ships, which they chased and\r\ncame up with, the one was commanded by Captain Richards,[6] the other\r\nby Capt. Tosor, both bound to the bay. Having plunder'd the Ships and\r\ntaken out some young men, they dismist the rest and Tosors Ship and\r\nmade a man of War of Richards's, which they put under the command of\r\nBellamy, and appointed Paull Williams Captain of the Sloop. Next day\r\nthey took a Bristol Ship[7] commanded by James Williams from Ireland\r\nladen with provisions, and having taken out what provisions they\r\nwanted and two or three of the Crew let her goe. Then they parted with\r\ntheir French consort at the Island of Blanco[8] and stood away with\r\ntheir Ship and Sloop to the windward passage, where in the latter end\r\nof February last they met with Captain Laurence Prince in a ship of\r\n300 Ton called the _Whido_, with 18 guns mounted, and fifty men, bound\r\nfrom Jamaica to London, laden with Sugar, Indico, Jesuits bark and\r\nsome silver and gold, and having given chase thre daies took him\r\nwithout any other resistance than his firing two chase guns at the\r\nSloop, and came to an anchor at Long Island.[9] Bellamy's crew and\r\nWilliams's consisted then of 120 men. They gave the Ship taken from\r\nCaptain Richards to Captain Prince, and loaded her with as much of the\r\nbest and finest goods as she could carry, and gave Captain Prince\r\nabove twenty pounds in Silver and gold to bear his charges. They took\r\n8 or 10 men belonging to Captain Prince; the Boatswain and two more\r\nwere forced, the rest being volunteers. off Petteguavis[10] they took\r\nan English Ship hired by the French, laden with Sugar and Indico, and\r\nhaving taken out what they had occasion for, and some of the men,\r\ndismist her. Then they stood away for the Capes of Virginia, being 130\r\nmen in Company, and having lost sight of the Sloop the day before they\r\nmade the land, they cruised ten daies, according to agreement between\r\nBellamy and Williams, in which time they seized three ships and one\r\nSnow, Two of them from Scotland, one from Bristol, and the fourth a\r\nScotch Ship, last from Barbadoes, with a little Rum and Sugar on\r\nboard, so leaky that the men refused to proceed further. The Pirats\r\nsunk her. Having lost the Sloop they kept the Snow, which was taken\r\nfrom one Montgomery, being about 100 Ton, and manned her with 18\r\nhands, which with her own Crew made up the number of 28 men; the other\r\ntwo Ships were discharged being first plundered.

Crumpsty to take his\r\nPapers, and go aboard the said Ship with five of his hands and\r\naccordingly the said Crumpsty with five of his Men rowed aboard the\r\nsaid Pyrates Ship, and the seven Men tarryed aboard the Pink, and soon\r\nafter the Pyrates sent their boat on board the said pink with four\r\nhands to get some of the Wine which they were Informed was on board\r\nthe Pink, and accordingly they hoisted the pinks boat off of the\r\nhatches and opened the hatches and then went into the hold, but the\r\nCable being Quoiled in the hatchway, they found it difficult to Come\r\nto the Wines in the hold, and so returned to their own Ship without\r\nany wine, Except five bottles of green wine which the found in the\r\npinks Cabbin and carryed away, with some of the Cloaths which belonged\r\nto the pinks Company, and presently after the pyrates had hoisted\r\ntheir boat on board the great Ship, they gave Orders to the Pyrates on\r\nboard the pink to steer North Northwest after them, which Course they\r\nfollowed till about four a Clock in the afternoon, and then the large\r\nShip whereof Capt. Samuel Bellame was Commander, and the snow and pink\r\nlay too,[2] it being very thick foggy weather, And about half an hour\r\nafter four a Clock a sloop came up with Capt. Bellames Ship and he\r\nhoisted out his boat and sent several men on board the Sloop and soon\r\nafterwards, Vizt. about five a Clock, the Commander of the snow bore\r\naway, and came under the stern of Capt. Bellames Ship and told him\r\nthat they saw the Land; And thereupon Capt. Bellame Ordered the\r\nPyrates on board the Pink to steer away North, which they did, and as\r\nsoon as it began to be dark the sd Capt. Bellames Ship put out a light\r\nastern and also the snow and the sloop and the pink had their lights\r\nout; and about ten a Clock the weather grew thick and it lightned and\r\nrained hard and was so dark, that the pinks Comp. Could not see the\r\nshore till they were among the Breakers, when the Depon't Fitz Gerald\r\nwas at helm, and had lost sight of the Great Ship, Snow and Sloop; and\r\nbeing among the breakers we thought it most proper and necessary to\r\nweere[3] the Pink, and before we could trim the head sails we run\r\nashoar opposite to Sluts bush at the back of Stage harbour to the\r\nsouthward of Cape Codd[4] between ten and Eleven a Clock at night, And\r\nthe seven Pyrates together with the Depon't and a young man named\r\nJames Donovan tarryed on board the said Pink till break of day[5] and\r\nthen found the shoar side of the Pink dry and so all of them went on\r\nshoar upon the Island called Poachy[6] beach, and there tarryed till\r\nabout ten a Clock, when two Men came over in a Canno, Namely John\r\nCole[7] and William Smith, who Carryed the seven pyrates over to the\r\nMain land, and then Cole came again to the Depon't and Inquired who\r\nthey (meaning the pyrates) were, and the Depon't Mackconothy Answered\r\nthey were pyrates and had taken the said pink, and soon after the said\r\nJohn Cole Informed Mr. Justice Done of Barnstable[8] thereof, by\r\nvirtue of whose Warrant the said seven Pyrates were Apprehended, and\r\nthe Depon'ts Journeyed with them to Boston, where they are now in\r\nCustody of the Keeper of His Maj'ties Goal as is aforesaid.

Bellamy and\r\nforced to tarry with him, otherwise was threatened to be put upon a\r\nDesolate Island where there was nothing to Support him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The _St. Michael_.]\r\n\r\nThomas Baker Saith that he and Simon Van Vorst were both taken out of\r\none Vessell, That he Attempted to make his Escape at Spanish Town,[5]\r\nand the Governour of that place seemed to favour his Design, till\r\nCapt. Bellamy and his Company sent the Governour word that they would\r\nburn and destroy the Town, if that the sd Baker and those that\r\nConcealed themselves with him were not delivered up, And afterwards he\r\nwould have made his Escape at Crabb Island[6] but was hindred by four\r\nof Capt.

Bellamy and Monsr.\r\nLabous; and they had Agreed to let him go to the Coast of Crocus[7] in\r\nthe French Vessel which they took him in, But the Commander thereof\r\nsoon after dyed and so Captn. Bellamy would not permit him to proceed\r\nthe sd. Voyage and he was unavoidably forced to Continue among the\r\nPyrates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Caracas?]\r\n\r\nPeter Cornelius Hoof Declares and Saith That he was taken by Capt.\r\nBellamy in a Vessel whereof John Cornelius was Master, That the sd.\r\nBellamys Company swore they would kill him unless he would Joyn with\r\nthem in their unlawfull Designs.\r\n\r\nJohn Shuan, by his Interpreter, Saith That he was sick at the time\r\nwhen Capt. Bellamy took him, and went on board the Pyrate Vessel at\r\nthe Instance of Capt. Bellamy's Doctor, who advised him to stay with\r\nhim till his Cure. And that when he went on board the Pink _Mary Anne_\r\nhe did not Carry any Arms with him; and that he hoped by going on\r\nboard the Pink he should the sooner make his Escape from the Pyrates,\r\nfor that he had a better way of getting his Living than by Pyrating.\r\n\r\nThe Evidence for the King being fully heard, and also the Pleas and\r\nAllegations made by the Prisoners at the Barr, His Majesty's Attorney\r\nGeneral[8] in a very handsome and learned speech summed up the\r\nEvidence and made his Remarques upon the whole, and the Court was\r\ncleared, and the Evidence and pleadings thereupon against the\r\nPrisoners, with their Defences, having been duly considered, and the\r\nQuestion put,[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Paul Dudley, acting as king's advocate before the special\r\ncommission appointed under the act of 11 and 12 Will.

On Oct.\r\n22 Van Vorst, Brown, Quintor, Hoof, Shuan, and Baker were condemned\r\nand sentenced to death. Cotton Mather records in his _Diary_, II. 483,\r\nthat on Nov. 2 he had obtained a reprieve, perhaps a pardon, for one\r\nwho was more penitent and less guilty than the others (South or Davis?\r\nbut both had been acquitted). On Nov. 15 he records, II. 488, \"Six\r\npirates executed. I took a long and sad Walk with them, from the\r\nPrison to the Place of Execution\", instructed them, and prayed with\r\nthem.

October 28, 1717._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Suffolk Court Files, fragment 99. Davis was tried\r\nseparately, on Oct. 28, and acquitted on Oct. 30.]\r\n\r\nThen the Kings Evidences were called into Court and, no Objection agt\r\nthem being made by the Prisoner,\r\n\r\nOwen Morris, Marriner, was first Examined upon Oath, Who solemnly\r\nTestifyed and Declared that he knew the Prisoner at the Barr, That he\r\nbelonged to the Ship _St. Michael_, whereof James Williams was Master,\r\nand in the Month of September 1716 They left Bristol bound to Jamaica\r\nand in December following the said Ship was taken by two Pyrat Sloops,\r\none comanded by Capt. Samuel Bellamy, and the other by Louis Le Boose,\r\nabout Twenty Leagues off Sabia,[2] That they Gave the said Williams\r\nhis Ship and Detained the Prisoner, because he was a Carpenter and a\r\nSingleman, together with Three others of the Ships Company. And\r\nfurther the Dep't Saith that the Prisoner was very Unwilling to goe\r\nwith Bellamy and prevailed with him by reason of his Intreatys to\r\npromise that he should be Discharged the next Vessell that was taken,\r\nand afterwards the Dep't was again taken in the Ship _Whido_,\r\nCommanded by Capt. Prince, by the said Captain Bellamy, who was then\r\nCommander of the Ship _Sultana_, taken from Capt. Richards as the\r\nDep't understood, and then he saw the Pris'r aboard the said Ship. At\r\nwhich time the Pris'r reminded the said Bellamy of his promise. When\r\nhe asked him if he was willing to goe he answered, yes, and then the\r\nsaid Capt. Bellamy replyed if the Company would Consent he should go.\r\nAnd thereupon he asked his Comp'y if they were willing to lett Davis\r\nthe Carpenter go, Who Expressed themselves in a Violent manner saying\r\nno, Dam him, they would first shoot him or Whip him to Death at the\r\nMast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Saba; see doc. no. 108, note 5.]\r\n\r\nThomas South, Marriner, lately taken by Capt. Samuel Bellamy in the\r\nPyrate Ship _Whido_, Cast away upon this Coast, and Discharged upon\r\nhis Tryal, was admitted an Evidence, and being Accordingly Sworn\r\nSaith; That the said Bellamy while he was in Command of the said Ship\r\n_Whido_ took a Scotch Vessel off the Capes of Virginia last Spring,\r\nCutt down her Masts and Sunk her. That he heard the said Thomas Davis\r\nwent on Board her: but I did not see him. That this Depo't Thought it\r\nnot prudent to be too familiar with the Prisoner[3] because it might\r\ntend to Create a Jealousy in the Pyrates, that the Depo't and the\r\nPris'r (whom they Suspected, because he was a forced man) would runn\r\naway together, and The Depo't Saith further that Capt. James Williams,\r\nCommander of the Ship _St. Michael_ (whose Carpenter the Pris'r was)\r\nIntreated the said Capt. Bellamy when he took him to lett the Pris'r\r\ngo. But the Ships Comp'y would by no means Consent thereto by reason\r\nhe was a Carpenter, And swore that they would shoot him before they\r\nwould lett him go from them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: He had been a shipmate of Davis on the _St. Michael_.]\r\n\r\nCapt. John Brett, Marriner, Sworn, Saith that he was taken by Capt.\r\nSamuel Bellamy before the Ship _Sultania_ was taken from Capt.\r\nRichards, and then it was the Custome among the Pyrates to force no\r\nPrisoners, but those that remained with them were Voluntiers.\r\n\r\nCapt. Thomas Fox, sworn, saith that he was taken by the Pyrates in\r\nJuly last and Robb'd, and they Questioned him whether anything was\r\ndone to the Pyrates in Boston Goall. The Depo't Answered he knew\r\nnothing about them, and in particular a Dutchman belonging to the\r\nPyrate asked him about his Consort, a Dutch Man, in Boston Prison, and\r\nsaid that if the Prisoners Suffered they would Kill every Body they\r\ntook belonging to New England.\r\n\r\nSeth Smith, Prison keeper in Boston, sworn, Saith that when the\r\nPrisoner at the Barr was first brought to Goal his Illness hindered\r\ntheir talking together, But sometime after as they were discoursing\r\nthe Depo't observed to the Prisoner that if he would be Ingenious and\r\nmake a Confession he might save his Life and be a good Evidance\r\nagainst the other Pyrates in Prison, To which the Prisoner made answer\r\nthat he was abused by Several of the Pyrates that were Drowned and was\r\nGlad he had got from them, but knew nothing against the Rest of the\r\nPyrates in Prison.\r\n\r\nThen the Kings Council moved the Court that Capt. Thomas Glyn, a\r\nPrisoner for Debt upon Execution, might be brought into Court to give\r\nEvidence on his Majestys behalf in this Tryal, Whereupon the Court\r\ndirected the Sheriffs who have the keeping of his Majestys Goal to\r\nbring the said Glyn into Court.\r\n\r\nCapt. Isaac Morris, Sworn, Saith That on the 14th of September 1716 he\r\nwas taken by the Pyrates but knows nothing of Capt. Bellamy or his\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\nCapt. Thomas Glyn, being brought into Court by the Sheriffs and\r\nInterrogated upon Oath, Saith that he never knew the Prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_114.

Therefore upon a Grant of new Powers, I must humbly submit\r\nit to their Lordships Consideration, whether it may be for the Honour\r\nand Service of his Majesty, to permit the Vice-Admiralty Courts in the\r\nPlantations to proceed in Prize Causes, since it is much to be feared\r\nthey are not well versed in the Laws of Nations, and Treaties between\r\nUs and other States; and it is well known that they do not proceed in\r\nthat Regular Manner as is practised in His Majesties High Court of\r\nAdmiralty; besides it will be a Considerable Time before Orders from\r\ntheir Lordships upon any Emergency can reach the Vice Admiralty Courts\r\nin the plantations, for want of which great Inconveniences may arise;\r\nwhereas the Admiralty Court here is under their Lordships Eye and\r\nImmediate direction, and always ready to observe such Instructions as\r\nthe Nature of affairs shall require.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 6 Anne ch. 37, \"An Act for the Encouragement of the Trade\r\nto America\" (1707), sect. 2.]\r\n\r\nBut this is most humbly submitted to Their Lordships great Wisdom, by,\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour most humble servant\r\n\r\nH.

August 22, 1720._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the file possessed by the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n_Boston_, On Monday last, the 15th Currant, arrived here the Ship\r\n_Samuel_, about eleven Weeks from London, and ten from Lands end,\r\nCapt. Samuel Carry Commander,[2] who in his Voyage hither, on the 13th\r\nof July past, in the Latitude of 44, about 30 or 40 Leagues to the\r\nEastward of the Banks of New-foundland, was accosted and taken by two\r\nPirates, viz., A Ship of 26 Guns, and a Sloop of ten, both Commanded\r\nby Capt. Thomas Roberts,[3] having on board about a hundred Men, all\r\nEnglish: The dismal Account whereof follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sewall notes in his diary, under this same date of Aug.\r\n15, \"Cary arrives who had been pillaged by the Pirats.\" Mass. Hist.\r\nSoc. _Coll._, XLVII. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For Thomas read Bartholomew. Bartholomew Roberts was one\r\nof the most famous pirates of his time, _i.e._, of the years\r\n1718-1724, the heyday of piracy in the eighteenth century. Capt.\r\nCharles Johnson, in his account of that period, _A General History of\r\nthe Pyrates_ (London, 1724), devotes nearly a third of his book (pp.\r\n161-260 of the first edition) to Roberts, as \"having made more Noise\r\nin the World\" than others, and declares (p. 3 of preface) that\r\n\"Roberts and his Crew, alone, took 400 Sail, before he was destroy'd\".\r\nOf his appearance we have this picture, from the same chronicler's\r\naccount of his last fight: a tall dark Welshman of near forty,\r\n\"Roberts himself made a gallant Figure, being dressed in a rich\r\ncrimson Damask Wastcoat, and Breeches, a red Feather in his Hat, and a\r\nGold Chain Ten Times round his Neck, a Sword in his Hand, and two pair\r\nof Pistols hanging at the End of a Silk Sling, which was flung over\r\nhis Shoulders, according to the Fashion of the Pyrates\" (p. 213). His\r\nmeteoric career of piracy lasted but four years.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing the Pirates did, was to strip both Passengers and\r\nSeamen of all their Money and Cloths which they had on board, with a\r\nloaded Pistol held to every ones breast ready to shoot him down, who\r\ndid not immediately give an account of both, and resign them up. The\r\nnext thing they did was, with madness and rage to tare up the Hatches,\r\nenter the Hould like a parcel of Furies, where with Axes, Cutlashes,\r\netc., they cut, tore and broke open Trunks, Boxes, Cases and Bales,\r\nand when any of the Goods came upon Deck which they did not like to\r\ncarry with them aboard their Ship, instead of tossing them into the\r\nHould again they threw them over-board into the Sea. The usual method\r\nthey had to open Chests was by shooting a brace of Bullets with a\r\nPistol into the Key-hole to force them open. The Pirates carryed away\r\nfrom Capt. Carry's Ship aboard their own 40 barrels of Powder, two\r\ngreat Guns, his Cables, etc. and to the value of about nine or ten\r\nThousand Pounds Sterling worth of the Choicest Goods he had on board.\r\nThere was nothing heard among the Pirates all the while, but Cursing,\r\nSwearing, Dam'ing and Blaspheming to the greatest degree imaginable,\r\nand often saying they would not go to Hope point[4] in the River of\r\nThames to be hung up in Gibbets a Sundrying as Kidd and Bradish's\r\nCompany did, for if it should chance that they should be Attacked by\r\nany Superiour power or force, which they could not master, they would\r\nimmediately put fire with one of their Pistols to their Powder, and go\r\nall merrily to Hell together! They often ridicul'd and made a mock at\r\nKing George's Acts of Grace[5] with an Oath, that they had not got\r\nMoney enough, but when they had, if he then did grant them one, after\r\nthey sent him word, they would thank him for it. They forced and took\r\naway with them Capt. Carry's Mate, and his Seamen, viz. Henry Gilespy,\r\nMate,[6] Hugh Minnens,[7] both North Britains, Michael Le Couter, a\r\nJersey Man, and Abraham, a Kentish Man, could not learn his Sir-name,\r\nthe Captains Book being carryed away, (except one Row born in Dublin\r\nwhich they would not take because born in Ireland),[8] holding a\r\nPistol with a brace of Bullets to each of their breasts to go with\r\nthem, or be presently shot down, telling them that at present they\r\nwanted none of their Service; but when they came to any Action, they\r\nshould have liberty to Fight and Defend the Ship as they did, or else\r\nimmediately be shot, that they should not tell tales. They had on\r\nboard the Pirate near 20 Tuns of Brandy. However the Pirates made\r\nthemselves very merry aboard of Capt. Carry's Ship with some Hampers\r\nof fine Wines that were either presents, or sent to some Gentlemen in\r\nBoston; it seems they would not wait to unty them and pull out the\r\nCorks with Skrews, but each man took his bottle and with his Cutlash\r\ncut off the Neck and put it to their Mouths and drank it out.[9]\r\nWhilst the Pirates were disputing whither to sink or burn Capt.\r\nCarry's Ship they spy'd a Sail that same evening, and so let him go\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Probably a derisive phrase of their own, for the ordinary\r\nplace of execution near Wapping Old Stairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Proclamations offering pardon to pirates who should\r\nsurrender themselves within a given time. Two such proclamations of\r\nGeorge I., Sept. 5, 1717, and Dec. 21, 1718, are printed in the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society's volume of royal proclamations relating\r\nto America, _Transactions_, XII. 176-178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: When the survivors of Roberts's crew were tried at Cape\r\nCorso Castle on the African coast in March and April, 1722, and\r\nfifty-two of them executed, this man (\"Harry Glasby\") was acquitted,\r\nfor, though he had risen to be master of the principal pirate ship,\r\nthere was abundant evidence (Johnson, first ed., pp. 186, 235-238)\r\nthat he had always been unwilling to continue with the pirates, that\r\nhe had tried to escape, and that he had often shown himself humane.\r\nScott uses the name of Harry Glasby in _The Pirate_, vol. II., ch. 11,\r\nborrowing it from Johnson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Or Menzies. _Ibid._, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Roberts's hostility toward Irishmen arose from the trick\r\nplayed upon him by one of his lieutenants, an Irishman named Kennedy,\r\nwho on the coast of Surinam ran away with both his ship and a good\r\nPortuguese prize. _Ibid._, pp. 166-169.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: They seem to have been painfully destitute of corkscrews.\r\nA year later, on the West African coast, when they had captured in a\r\nship of the Royal African Company the chaplain of Cape Coast Castle,\r\nand had asked him to join them, \"alledging merrily, that their Ship\r\nwanted a Chaplain\", and he had declined, they gave him back all his\r\npossessions, and \"kept nothing which belonged to the Church, except\r\nthree Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw, which, as I was inform'd by\r\none of the Pyrates himself, they said they had Occasion for, for their\r\nown Use\". _Ibid._, p. 198.]\r\n\r\nAnd at Midnight they came up with the same, which was a Snow from\r\nBristol, Capt. Bowls Master, bound for Boston, of whom they made a\r\nPrize, and serv'd him as they did Capt. Carry, unloaded his Vessel and\r\nforced all his Men, designing to carry the Snow with them to make her\r\na Hulk to carreen their Ship with.\r\n\r\nThe abovesaid Capt. Roberts in Novemb. 1718,[10] was third Mate of a\r\nGuinea Man out of London for Guinea, Capt. Plummer Commander, who was\r\ntaken by a Pirate, and by that means Roberts himself became a Pirate,\r\nand being an active, brisk Man, they voted him their Captain, which he\r\nreadily embraced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Johnson says 1719 (second ed., p. 208), but 1718 is\r\ncorrect. The _Princess_, Capt. Plumb, was captured at Anamabo by Capt.\r\nHowel Davis. _Id._, first ed., p. 157; for the ensuing narrative,\r\n_cf._ pp. 175-178.]\r\n\r\nThe said Roberts in the abovesaid Sloop, Rhode Island built, with a\r\nBriganteen Consort Pirate, was some time in January last in the\r\nLatitude of Barbadoes, near the Island, where they took and\r\nendeavoured to take several Vessels; but the Governour,[11] hearing of\r\nit, fitted out one Capt. Rogers of Bristol, in a fine Gally, a Ship of\r\nabout 20 Guns, and a Sloop, Capt. Graves Commander; Capt. Rogers\r\nkilled and wounded several of Roberts's Men, and made a great hole in\r\nhis Sloop, which his Carpenter with very great Difficulty (hundreds of\r\nBullets flying round him) stopt, and finding Capt. Rogers too strong\r\nfor him, tho' Graves did nothing, which if had, he must of necessity\r\nbeen taken, he therefore run for it, as also did his Consort\r\nBriganteen, which he never saw nor heard of since.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Robert Lowther, governor 1710-1721.]\r\n\r\nFrom Barbadoes Roberts went to an Island called Granada,[12] to the\r\nLeeward of Barbadoes, where he carreen'd his Sloop, and from thence\r\nthis Spring with 45 Men he came to Newfoundland, into the Harbour of\r\nTrepassi,[13] towards the latter end of June last, with Drums beating,\r\nTrumpets sounding, and other Instruments of Musick, English Colours\r\nflying, their Pirate Flagg at the Topmast-Head, with Deaths Head and\r\nCutlash, and there being 22 sail in that Harbour, upon the sight of\r\nthe Pirate the Men all fled on Shore and left their Vessels, which\r\nthey possess'd themselves off, burnt, sunk and destroyed all of them,\r\nexcepting one Bristol Gally, which they designed to be their best\r\nPirate Ship, if a better did not present. After they did all the\r\nmischief they could in that Harbour, they came on upon the Banks,\r\nwhere they met nine or ten sail of Frenchmen, one of whom is the\r\nPirate Ship of 26 Guns abovesaid, taken from a French-man, unto whom\r\nRoberts the Pirate gave the Bristol Gally, but sunk and destroyed all\r\nthe other French Vessels, taking first out what Guns were fit for his\r\nown Ship, and all other valuable Goods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Grenada, not yet a British possession.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: At the southeast corner of Newfoundland, just west of\r\nCape Race.]\r\n\r\nRoberts the Pirate designed from Newfoundland to range thro' the\r\nWestern and Canary Islands, and so to the Southward, to the Island of\r\nNew Providence,[14] possest by Negroe's, in South Latitude 17, which\r\nthey say is the place of the Pirates General Rendezvous, where they\r\nhave a Fortification and a great Magazine of Powder, etc. where they\r\nintend to spend their Money with the Portuguize Negro Women. Roberts\r\nthe Pirate says, that there is a French Pirate on the North Coast of\r\nAmerica, who gives no Quarter to any Nation, and if he met him, he\r\nwould give him none. The Pirates seems much enraged at Bristol Men,\r\nfor Capt. Rogers sake, whom they hate as they do the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This island seems to be imaginary. In the Atlantic,\r\nwhich seems to be meant, there is no island in 17 deg. S. lat. except St.\r\nHelena. In the Indian Ocean there is a Providence Island in 9 deg. S.\r\nlat., north of Madagascar. But newspaper accuracy was no greater then\r\nthan now. Roberts went first to the West Indies, then to the west\r\ncoast of Africa, where after many exploits he was killed in battle\r\nwith H.M.S. _Swallow_, 50, in February, 1722. Johnson, first ed., pp.\r\n179-188, 193-214. The captain of the _Swallow_ was knighted for the\r\nexploit (capturing 187 pirates), and afterward became famous as\r\nAdmiral Sir Chaloner Ogle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY COURTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_118.

In 1726\r\nJudge Menzies was expelled from the legislature of Massachusetts for\r\nstoutly standing by the complaints he had made to the Admiralty on\r\nthis subject. A discussion of one of them, by Richard West, counsel to\r\nthe Board of Trade, is printed in Chalmers, _Opinions_ (ed. 1858), pp.\r\n515-519.]\r\n\r\nThis comes that the Lords Commissioners for Executing the Office of\r\nLord High Admiral may be informed of a Case that hath lately occurred\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Admiralty contained in my Commission,[4]\r\nNamely, One Benjamin Norton of Rhode-Island, and One Joseph Whippole,\r\na Considerable Merchant of that Colony,[5] did fit out a Brigantine,\r\nand sent her under the Command of the said Norton to the West Indies\r\nlast Fall (a Vessel by Common Observation more fit for Pirates than\r\nTrade for which they pretended to Employ her) who Fell in with the\r\nPirates at St. Lucia in January last, and was (as he saith) taken by\r\nOne Roberts a Pirate, though by the Sequel it appears, he is more to\r\nbe considered as one of their Assistants and Correspondents, for after\r\nhe had remained with them Six or Seven Weeks, They took a Ship Dutch\r\nBuilt of 250 Tuns Burthen, or thereby, and having Loaded her with\r\nSugars, Cocoa, Negroes, etc. of very considerable Value, All this they\r\ngave to him for his Brigantine though of much more Value than She, and\r\nby the most Judicious in the Country, is supposed to have been\r\ncommitted to him as one of their Trusties, to Vend the Cargo in that\r\nColony, a Practice not without precedent in that Colony these several\r\nYears past, if my Information fail not;[6] however, be that as it\r\nwill, he comes with this Ship and Cargo into Tarpaulin Cove,[7] a\r\nPlace lying between the Province of the Massachussets Bay and Rhode\r\nIsland, where (by the by) the Pirates used to come to infest Our\r\nCoasts in April last: And did in a Clandestine Manner advise the said\r\nJoseph Whipple of his arrival.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See _Acts P.C. Col._, III. 38-40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Benjamin Norton of Newport was probably the father of the\r\nBenjamin Norton who in 1741 was commander of the privateer _Revenge_,\r\nand as such figures in docs. nos. 114-162. Col. Joseph Whipple the\r\nyounger, afterward deputy governor of Rhode Island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: According to Johnson, _General History of the Pyrates_,\r\nfirst ed., pp. 183, 187, Roberts took at Dominica \"a Dutch Interloper\r\nof 22 Guns and 75 Men\" and a Rhode Island brigantine of which one\r\nNorton was master, and at Hispaniola, a little later, \"mann'd Nortons\r\nBrigantine, sending the Master away in the Dutch Interloper, not\r\ndissatisfied\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Tarpaulin Cove lies on the east side of Naushon, one of\r\nthe Elizabeth Islands.]\r\n\r\nAnd having dropped Anchor there, he fired at, and brought too several\r\nof Our Coasters, upon which a Rumour arose, that the Pirates were on\r\nthe Coast, whereby Our Coasters, except his Accomplices who understood\r\nbetter, were deterred for some Days from Falling within his reach, And\r\nin the interim, the aforesaid Whipple, with One Christopher Almy, and\r\nOne Pease, also considerable Traders of New Port in Rhode Island, with\r\nsome others, did improve that Opportunity, and carried off and\r\nconveyed about 30 of the Negroes, with considerable Quantities of the\r\nSugars, Cocoa, etc., partly in Sloops sent out by them for that\r\npurpose, and partly in such others as they intrusted therewith, and a\r\ngreat part of which was by the said Almy and Whipple directed to\r\nProvidence Plantacion and recommended to the Care and Conduct of One\r\nWhipple,[8] Brother to the said Joseph, that Place being their\r\nOrdinary Mart and Recepticles for such Cargoes. But so many\r\naccessaries were concerned, and the Cargo so considerable, the Secret\r\nwas Discovered, and thereupon the Officers of his Majesty's Customs,\r\nboth in the Province of Massachussets Bay and Colony of Rhode Island,\r\ndid exert themselves, and the Collector at Boston did Seize upon the\r\nShip and remainder of the Cargo,[9] The said Benjamin Norton upon the\r\nDiscovery having relinquished the Ship and absconded. And the\r\n_Surveyor and Searcher at Rhode Island did Seize upon and Secure the\r\nSloop_ belonging to one Draper, employed by the said Joseph Whipple,\r\nin which a considerable Quantities of the Sugars, etc., had been\r\ncarried off, And did insist against them, upon the breach of the Acts\r\nof Trade, for _Neglect to make Entries as the Law directs_. Upon which\r\nInformations I gave Decrees finding the same lawful Seizures, and\r\nOrdered the Values thereof (after Sale should be made) to be Paid into\r\nCourt, in regard of the Circumstantial Case, and delivered up to the\r\nCollector, etc., as Informers, upon their enacting and obliging\r\nthemselves in the Court of Admiralty to refund the Values in Case any\r\nOwner should appear and make good their Title thereto within Twelve\r\nMonths. This is complyed with at Boston, but in the Colony of\r\nRhode-Island, though the Informations were Laid at the instance of the\r\nOfficers of the Customes, and that I had given Decrees Condemnator[y]\r\nthereupon, and Ordered the Sales by Publick Vendue, Yet in regard I\r\nhad obliged them to Enact for Refunding, _The Collector_, in\r\nconjunccion with the Governor at Rhode Island,[10] and some others of\r\nhis Assistants who were concerned in these, who had a part of the\r\nGoods trusted in their Hands, till the same should be Sold by Warrant\r\nof the Court of Admiralty, Did put a Stop to the Sale appointed by me;\r\nAnd by an Act of the Governor and his Assistants have taken on them to\r\nsell and Dispose thereof, and to lodge the Price in other hands than\r\nby Decrees of Court was appointed, _albeit by their Charter_ they have\r\nno right so to do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Capt. John Whipple of Providence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The sheriff of Bristol county, Massachusetts, impressed\r\ntwelve men and horses and went to Tarpaulin Cove and took the ship\r\ninto custody. _Acts and Resolves Prov. Mass. Bay_, XI. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Samuel Cranston, governor 1698-1727.]\r\n\r\nI being apprized of this their Proceeding that since the Cargo was\r\nCondemned, and the Sale thereof appointed by the Court of Admiralty\r\nwhich issued upon Informacions laid by the Collector and Surveyor of\r\nhis Majesty's Plantation Duties, who had the Sugars and Cocoa in their\r\nCustody, and produced the Negroes before me in Court, There was an\r\nOrder past by the Governor and Council or Assistants at Rhode Island\r\ndirected to the Sheriffe, who of before had been one of these who put\r\nan Estimate upon the Negroes by appointment of the Judge of Admiralty,\r\nand to whom the Judge had Committed the Custody of the Negroes in\r\nCourt, Discharging him to deliver them up to the Judges Orders. I went\r\nto Rhode Island, (though I had a Deputy there) and waited on the\r\nGovernor, and shewed to him my _Commission under the Great Seal of\r\nAdmiralty_, which also was Recorded in their Books, and insisted with\r\nhim on this, That I am uncontrovertedly by my Commission the Competent\r\nJudge in these Parts upon the Contravention of the Acts of Trade, And\r\nmoreover, That by my Commission I am obliged to enquire after and\r\nsecure the Goods of all Pirates, etc., The words of my Commission\r\nbeing _ad inquirendum et investigandum de omnibus et singulis bonis\r\nPiratarum_, etc.[11] And as I was authorize[d] for that Effect, so I\r\nconceived that the Governor and his Assistants, their business was\r\nonly to be aiding and assisting to me in the Execution which I\r\nexpected. And therefore Demanded of him, That according to my Order in\r\nCourt, the Negroes might be produced as formerly by the Sheriffe in\r\nCourt in Order to Sale. And that the Publick Court House, and House\r\nwhere Vendues are usually made, may be made Patent to me as\r\nheretofore, And that the Governor's Order for Shutting up thereof and\r\ndenying Access to me may be recalled. At the same time I also informed\r\nhim that I was accountable to the Lords of Admiralty or Vice Admiralty\r\nfor the Values and Produce of the Sales made by my Decrees. During\r\nthis Conference a Quorum of his Assistants in Council came in, before\r\nwhom I again resumed my desire, To which I received this Answer, That\r\nthe Governor _considers himself as Vice Admiral_ and that as such he\r\nhath right _to intromett_ with All Goods belonging to Pirates, and\r\nthat _by the Charter all such is given to them_, and that he would not\r\nallow me the Priviledge of the Court House, unless I would comply with\r\nand acquiesse in their Acts of Council. To which I replyed, _Their\r\nCharter contains no such Grant of Admiralty jurisdiction nor right to\r\nany Piratical_ Goods (as will be evident on perusal thereof), Yea _in\r\nthe Year 1703/4 the Queen Discharged them from exercising any part of\r\nAdmiralty jurisdiction, which was complyed with ever since and the\r\nCourt constitute by the Kings Commission_.[12] And as to submitting to\r\ntheir Acts of Council when derogatory to His Majestys Interest and the\r\nAuthority of his Court of Admiralty (which I conceive their Act of\r\nwhich I complain is) was what I could not comply with, without\r\nrendering my self unworthy of the Trust committed to me and betraying\r\nthereof. Notwithstanding of all which they persisted in their\r\nResolution, and not only Debarred me from the Use of the Court House\r\nbut also to deliver up the Negroes, etc., to be sold, as I had\r\nordered, and afterward sold them amongst themselves at an undervalue:\r\nBy which their Contempt of his Majesty's Authority and Court of\r\nAdmiralty is obvious, Yea, their _incroaching upon and usurping of the\r\nAdmiralty Jurisdiction contrary to Queen Ann's express Order_\r\nabovementioned is Palpable, And their refusing to give that aid and\r\nassistance which the Judge did justly require of them in the terms of\r\nhis Commission appear to be highly punishable, if not a just ground\r\nfor forfeiture of their Charter, more especially being conjoyned with\r\nthis of a great many of that Colony, their keeping a continued\r\nCorrespondence with the Pirates, which renders the fair Traders very\r\nuneasy, and insecure. All which I humbly submit to their Lordships\r\nConsideration, and pray for redress, suitable encouragement, and\r\nsupport to him, who is\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nYour most humble Servant\r\n\r\nJ.

Phillips,\r\nwho was then on board the Pyrate Sloop, having one of his leggs Cut\r\noff,[6] and whom the Depont. saith is one of the Prisoners now at the\r\nBar; and the Depont. answered, Provided the Captain and the Men were\r\nwilling he would Carry him with him, but the sd. William Phillips\r\nrefused to go with the Depont. saying if he should they would hang\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The southwest point of Nova Scotia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The carpenter had sawed it off, somewhat amateurishly,\r\nafter it had been wounded in the fight between the captain and Ferne,\r\nas related below.

Saith That he knows William Phillips. he was\r\ntaken out of a Sloop sometime in October last. the first vessel that\r\nwas taken after Phillips's being taken was a Brigantine. Cannot say\r\nthat Phillips went on board the Brigantine. he never saw him Armed\r\nwith other arms than a Cutlass. That in February they took a snow\r\nbound from New York to Barbados, one Laws Master. Samuel Ferne, James\r\nWood, William Taylor and Wm. Phillips, one of Prisoners at the Bar,\r\nwent on board the snow armed with Cutlasses, who kept on board and\r\nNavigated sd snow, as far to the southward as the Lattitude of 21,\r\nwhere Ferne and Wood, attempting to run away with the scooner, in\r\norder thereto Confined Taylor and Phillips: But Capt. Phillips the\r\nPyrate firing upon the snow, she brought too, and the sd Ferne was\r\nCommanded on board, but he refused and fired upon Capt. Phillips and\r\nCompelled the Prisoner at the Bar, William Phillips, to come and abide\r\nupon Deck, where he had his left leg shot by Nutt, which was\r\nafterwards Cut off. That Isaac Lassen was taken at Newfoundland in\r\nSeptr last. That he was generally set at the helm to steer the vessel.\r\nhe was once set on board the snow armed, when Fern, Wood, etc., were\r\nrunning away with her. he never was forward nor did he ever see him\r\nGuilty of any Act of Pyracy when vessels were taken, nor Share any\r\nplunder, Except that they now and then obliged him to take a Shirt or\r\na pair of stockings when almost naked. That he was knowing of the\r\nrising to subdue the Pyrates, and took hold of the Captains Arm, when\r\nHarradine struck him in the head with the Ads. That Henry Gyles was\r\ntaken in February and forced to go with the Pyrates; Nutt obliged him\r\nto keep a Journal being an Artist.[7] he never saw him armed on board,\r\nthat he was always Contriving to get away, and has often told this\r\nDepont. that he would Escape if possible. that he was knowing of the\r\nrising against the pyrates and forward and Active in it. That Charles\r\nIvemay was taken and forced out of the same ship that Cheesman the\r\nCarpenter was. that he always behaved himself Civilly. he never saw\r\nhim Armed. That he was knowing of and brisk and Active in the rising\r\nagainst the Pyrates. That there was no vessel taken after John\r\nBootman, John Coombes and Henry Payne were taken.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In the sense, now obsolete, of a person having scientific\r\nattainments. \"The moon, whose orb Through optic glass the Tuscan\r\nartist views\" (Milton, referring to Galileo). Probably Giles had some\r\nknowledge of navigation. See his testimony in doc. no. 121.]\r\n\r\nEdward Cheesman Deposeth That William Phillips leg was Cut off before\r\nhe[8] was taken by the Pyrates, That Henry Gyles was Guilty of no Act\r\nof Pyracy that he ever saw or heard of, that he behaved himself\r\nCivilly, kept a Journal being an Artist, That he has often told this\r\nDepont. he would contrive some way or other to make his Escape, that\r\nhe was knowing of the Rising and forward and Active in it. That Isaac\r\nLassen behaved himself Civilly and always seemed to him to be a forced\r\nman, That he never saw him in Arms; was the Man that took hold of Capt\r\nPhillips's Arm when Harradine struck him. That Charles Ivemay was\r\nObliged and forced out of the same ship; he never was armed or forward\r\nwhen vessels were taken, That he was Privy to the Design of subduing\r\nthe Pyrates and active in Executing it. That Bootman, Combes and Payne\r\nseemed to be forced and there was no vessel taken after they Came on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cheesman.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Harradine Deposeth That Phillips's leg was Cut off before\r\nhis[9] being taken, knows nothing of him, That Lassen always behaved\r\nhimself well, he never saw him armed, that he has several times told\r\nthis Depont. that the Pyrates should never Carry him off the Coast to\r\nsuffer by them as he had done already, that he was the first that took\r\nhold of the Captain, when this Depont. struck him and killed him. That\r\nhe never saw any thing by Gyles and Ivemay but what was Civil, no ways\r\nActive as Pyrates, that they were both acquainted with the design of\r\nsubduing the Pyrates, and stirring and brisk in the Execution thereof.\r\nThat Bootman, Combes and Payne came on board after he was taken, there\r\nwas no Vessel taken after their being on board. That Bootman was Privy\r\nto and Active in the subduing the Pyrates, and Combes and Payne seemed\r\nto him to be forced men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Harradine's.]\r\n\r\nThe Witnesses having been Severally Examined and Deposed as aforesd.,\r\nthe Prisoners were asked whether they had any thing to say on their\r\nown Defence. William Phillips said he was forced by the Pyrates out of\r\nthe Sloop _Glasgow_, William Warden Master, that sometime after he\r\nwas on board, he understood there were articles drawn up,[10] for the\r\nCaptain Called him auft, and with his pistol Cocked demanded him to\r\nsign the sd. Articles or Else he would blow his Brains out, which he\r\nrefused to do, Reminding the Captain of his promise that he should be\r\ncleared; but the Captn. Declaring that it should not hurt him, and\r\nInsisting on it as aforesd., he was Obliged to sign the sd. Articles.\r\nThen when Ferne and Wood were running away with the snow, they never\r\ntold him what design they were upon but told him they were going to\r\nHolmes's hole,[11] and there every one to shift for himself, and the\r\nrest alledging they were forced men and some of them that they were in\r\nthe secret of subduing the Pyrates and active in it, and others that\r\nthere was no vessels taking whilst they were on board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Johnson, pp. 397-398, gives verbatim the text of these\r\narticles of agreement (_cf._ doc. no. 50), a very curious set, to\r\nwhich these pirates \"swore upon a Hatchet for want of a Bible.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Now Vineyard Haven, in Martha's Vineyard.]\r\n\r\nThen the Prisoners being taken away and all withdrawn but the\r\nRegister, The Court maturely Weighed and Considered the Evidences and\r\nCases of the Prisoners and by a Plurality of Voices found the sd\r\nWilliam Phillips Guilty of the Pyracies, Robberies and Felonys\r\nExhibited against him, and by an unanimous voice found the sd. Isaac\r\nLassen, Henry Gyles, Charles Ivemay, John Bootman, John Coombes and\r\nHenry Payne not Guilty.\r\n\r\nThen the Prisoners were brought to the Bar and the President\r\nacquainted William Phillips That the Court had found him Guilty of the\r\nPyracies, Robberies and Felonies Exhibited against him, and asked him\r\nif he had any thing to say why sentence of Death should not pass upon\r\nhim for his Offences.\r\n\r\nAnd he offering nothing Material the President Pronounced sentence of\r\nDeath against him in the following words--\r\n\r\n\"You, William Phillips, are to go from hence to the place from whence\r\nyou Come and from thence to the place of Execution, and there you are\r\nto be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and God of His Infinite\r\nMercy save your Soul.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the President Pronounced the said Isaac Lassen, Henry Gyles,\r\nCharles Ivemay, John Bootman, John Coombs and Henry Payne not Guilty.\r\n\r\nThen the Court adjourned till to morrow morning Eight of the Clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_121.

That in taking several\r\nVessels White was more Active than others, who pretended to be forced\r\nmen.

William\r\nWhite says he is sorry he should Commit such a sin, that he was in\r\nDrink when he went away with Phillips, Nutt, etc., in Mr Minotts\r\nscooner. John Archer and Willm Taylor say they were forced Men, and\r\nArcher, being asked how he Came to be Quarter Master, Answered that\r\nthe Company thought him the fittest Man for a Quarter master and so\r\nChose him.\r\n\r\nThen the Kings Advocate General summed up the nature of the Evidence\r\nagainst the Prisoners, and the Prisoners were taken from the Bar, and\r\nthe Court cleared and in private.\r\n\r\nThen the Court Maturely weighed and Considered the Evidences and the\r\nPrisoners Cases, and Unanimously found William White, John Rose\r\nArcher, and William Taylor Guilty of Pyracy, robbery and Felony\r\naccording to the Articles Exhibited against them. Then the Prisoners\r\nwere brought to the Bar and the President acquainted them that the\r\nCourt by a Unanimous Voice had found them Guilty. Then the Court\r\nAdjourned to three a Clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_122. Trial of John Baptis and Peter Taffery. May 13, 1724._\r\n\r\nThe Court met and Opened according to Adjournm't by Proclamation and\r\nOrdered John Baptis and Peter Taffery, two French Men, to be brought\r\n[to] the Bar, and they were brought to the Bar accordingly and ordered\r\nto attend to the articles read agt. them for Pyracy, Robbery and\r\nFelony.\r\n\r\nAnd the Register read the articles, which were the four last articles\r\nof those Exhibited against William Phillips, Isaac Lassen, etc., to\r\nwhich articles the sd John Baptis and Peter Taffery severally pleaded\r\nnot Guilty. Then the Kings Evidences being sworn, Called and\r\nInterrogated, Deposed as follows.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lancy Deposed That whilst he was on board the Pyrat, up[on]\r\ntheir Coming up with a Cape Anne vessel, Phillips the Captain [of] the\r\nPyrat ordered John Baptis to fetch up a Musquet, which he did, and\r\nwhen the Captain was going to take the Musquet [to] fire, Baptis\r\ntwicht it out of his hands and fired it him[self], That Baptist was\r\none that went on board a sloop, one [Beel] Master, Armed.\r\n\r\nDavid Jaw, belonging to the Scooner [whereof] Will'm Lancy was\r\nSkipper, Deposed That John Baptis Came [on] board their Vessel with\r\nseveral others armed. That Baptis Came [up] to this Depont. and Damnd\r\nhim and kicked him in his legs and [pointed] to his Boots,[1] which\r\nwas a sign as this Depont understood it that he wanted his Boots, and\r\nhe accordingly pull'd them off and Baptist took them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Baptis, it will be remembered, did not speak English;\r\nhence it was that he resorted to the expressive language of manual\r\n(and pedal) signs.]\r\n\r\nJohn Filmore Deposed That John Baptis and Peter Taffery, upon the\r\nrising against the Pyrates, with others fell upon James Sparkes, the\r\nGunner of the Pyrate, and killed him and threw [him] Overboard.\r\n\r\nEdward Cheesman Deposed That John Baptis always carried himself\r\nCivilly on board and was always for[ward] to rise upon the Pyrates.\r\nThat Peter Taffery was [more active] than Baptis, that he saw him fire\r\nat vessels [two or three] times.\r\n\r\nHenry Giles Deposed That William[2] Phillips, the Capt[tain] of the\r\nPyrate, was always afraid of John Baptis that he would do him some\r\ndamage, That Baptis was always ready and forward to rise upon the\r\nPyrates, when they talkt of rising, That he has seen them go Armed on\r\nboard Vessels, but cant say he had any share of the plunder, That\r\nTaffery was more active than Baptis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: John.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Harradine Deposed he never saw any thing but what was Civil in\r\nBaptis and Taffery, That they were very forward upon the rising, as\r\nsoon as they perceived what they were about, and were very much\r\nrejoiced when it was done and they had got their Liberty.\r\n\r\nThen the Court ordered That all Persons should depart but the Judges\r\nand Register; and having Maturely weighed the Evidences unanimously\r\nfound John Baptist and Peter Taffry not Guilty. Then the Prisoners\r\nwere brought to the Bar and the President declared That the Court had\r\nfound them not Guilty.\r\n\r\nThen the Court Adjourned till the Morrow Morning.\r\n\r\nAnd the Court being met according to Adjournment, Francisco, Pedro,\r\nand Pierro, three negros, were brought to the Bar and Arraigned, but\r\nno Evidences appearing to alledge any Acts of Pyracy against them, but\r\nall [alledging] that they were Imployed in Cooking the Kettle, The\r\nCourt [unanimously] found them not [Guilty].[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: But apparently John Baptis's new lease of life was not\r\nlong. \"November 2 [1726].

The crime was piracy.]\r\n\r\nAnd then after passing [some necessary orders] relating to [the]\r\nExecution of the Pyrates, etc. [The Court adjourned without] Day.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Archer and White were executed on June 2, 1724. Cotton\r\nMather ministered to them in their last days, adding, one would think,\r\na new horror to death. The sermon he preached at them was forthwith\r\nprinted by him, _The Converted Sinner ... A Sermon Preached in Boston,\r\nMay 31, 1724, In the Hearing and at the Desire of certain Pirates_\r\n[Archer and White], _a little before their Execution, To which there\r\nis added, A more private Conference of a Minister with them_ (Boston,\r\n1724). With his usual insufferable vanity, he indicates that the\r\ncapture of the pirates was widely attributed to his public prayer\r\nagainst pirates on Sunday, Apr. 26: \"Behold, before the week was out,\r\nthere comes in a Vessel wherein\" were the captive pirates. But the\r\nvictorious mutiny against the pirates occurred on Apr. 18, and without\r\ndisparaging Dr. Mather's influence in the councils of Heaven, it seems\r\ndoubtful if the rising could have been caused by prayers publicly\r\noffered by him on the 26th. After the trial he adds: \"One of the first\r\nThings which the Pyrates, who are now so much the Terror of them that\r\nhaunt the Sea, impose on their poor Captives, is, to curse Dr. M----r.\r\nThe Pyrates now strangely fallen into the Hands of Justice here, make\r\nme the first Man, whose Visits and Counsils and Prayers they beg for.\r\nSome of them under Sentence of Death, chuse to hear from me the Last\r\nSermon they hear in the world.

This shipmaster\r\nwould be some humble member of the clan.]\r\n\r\n_answer._ on the 15th day of January last this Depon't, who was\r\nLieutenant of the Sloop _Young Eagle_ but at that Time Commander\r\nthereof in the absence of Philip Dumaresq the Captain, about three or\r\nfour Leagues off the Grand Canary Island took the Sloop in this\r\nInterro. mention'd, standing in for Santa Crux in Teneriffe, and came\r\nlast from Corke, and as the Master thereof said to this Depon't was\r\nbound to Madera,[11] but then going into one of the Canary Islands to\r\nget water, whereupon this Depon't sent his then Lieuten't on board,\r\nwho Inform'd this Depon't that there was one Cask full of Water and\r\nanother runing out and that he stopt the same and afterwards they\r\nfound water sufficient to serve them in their Passage to Madera which\r\nwas ab't three Weeks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _I.e._, to a Portuguese, neutral, port.]\r\n\r\n_Interro. 2d._ What was the Lading of the Sloop _Amsterdam Post_?\r\n\r\n_Answer._ She was Loaded with Beef, Butter, Hatts, Shoes, Candles,\r\nSoap, Hides and some Pilchards, and for greater Certainty this Depon't\r\nreferrs himself to the Bills of Lading.\r\n\r\n_Interro. 3._ Are the Papers now produced before you and now Lodged in\r\nthis Court, the Papers that were taken on Board the said Sloop as you\r\nknow, or have heard, how, and in what manner?\r\n\r\n_a._ This Depon't did not go on board said Sloop when taken and\r\ntherefore can't say of his own knowledge that these are the Papers\r\ntaken on board, but verily believes they are, for these Papers were\r\nsent to this Depon't by his Lieuten't from said Vessell some short\r\nTime after she was taken, and two of the Papers, namely, an English\r\nMediterranean Pass[12] and a Paper in Spanish Importing a Clearance,\r\nas this Depon't was Inform'd by his officers whom he sent on board,\r\nwas found between two Bed Bottoms belonging to the Master of said\r\nSloop, and afterwards this Depon't saw the very place where they sayd\r\nthe Papers were Concealed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See doc. no. 141. A pass from the Admiralty, which, in\r\naccordance with the treaties between Great Britain and the Dey of\r\nAlgiers, English vessels entering the Mediterranean had to carry in\r\norder to be exempt from search by the Algerine corsairs. Such a pass,\r\nof 1750, is printed in Marsden, _Law and Custom of the Sea_, II.\r\n347-348. A full set of ships' papers seems to have consisted, at least\r\nin Dutch practice, of a bill of health (see doc. no. 197), a sea-letter\r\nor let-pass (docs. nos. 129, 130), a muster-roll (_role d'equipage_)\r\nor shipping-articles of the crew, and a clearance for the cargo.]\r\n\r\n_Interro. 4._ Did you hear the sd Master of the Sloop aforesd Declare\r\nwhere he took in his aforesaid Loading?\r\n\r\n_A._ This Depon't at Divers times heard the said Master Acknowledge\r\nand Declare that he took in his aforesd Loading at Corke in the\r\nKingdom of Ireland, and also that he went from Teneriffe to Corke,\r\nwhere he purchased sd Loading, and was to return with the same\r\nimmediately to Teneriffe, where two of his owners were Inhabitants and\r\none other owner an Inhabitant of Holland.\r\n\r\n_Interro. 5._ What was done with the Cargo after the Vessell and Cargo\r\nwas thus taken?\r\n\r\n_A._ All the Cargo with the Vessell was Carried into Madera and all or\r\nthe greatest part of sd Cargo was Landed there.\r\n\r\n_Interro. 6._ Is the Sloop now under Seizure the same Sloop that was\r\nthus taken?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes.\r\n\r\n_Interro. 7._ What became of the hands belonging to said Sloop?\r\n\r\n_A._ Two of them went on board the Man of War there, and two others\r\nwent on board this sd Privateer, and the Mate was carried to\r\nGibraltar, where he heard he ran away.\r\n\r\n_Interro. 8._ Do you know or have you heard what Nation those hands\r\nwere of?\r\n\r\n_A._ The Master, Mate and one hand more he understood to be Scotch,\r\ntwo hands more to be Irish, one Boy belonging to London and a\r\nPortugueze or Spanish negro man.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, Do you know anything further relating to sd Vessell and\r\nCargo or any other former Voyages the said Vessell had made and where\r\nto?\r\n\r\n_A._ He heard the Master acknowledge he had been upwards of two years\r\nMaster of said Vessell, during which Time he always used the Canary\r\nTrade, and always acknowledged his Vessell belonged to England till\r\nthe last Voyage.\r\n\r\nJOHN ROUS.\r\n\r\n1740, August 12th. John Rous, the Subscriber to the aforegoing, made\r\noath to the Truth thereof Before Me.\r\n\r\nROB'T AUCHMUTY, Judge Ad'y.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rous being Sworn in Court acknowledged his Examination already\r\ntaken was the Truth. He also Declared there was Water enough on board\r\nthe Sloop _Amsterdam Post_ to carry her into Madera, and actually\r\nserved them for that purpose, viz. three of said Sloop's Crew and five\r\nbelonging to the Privateer, which was one more than was on board at\r\nthe time of the Capture; That Capt. Mackay was summoned by a\r\nPortugueze officer from the Consul[13] at Captn. Dumaresqs request, as\r\nCapt. Mackay told him, to go in the Privateer Sloop to Gibraltar in\r\norder for a Tryal; that Capt. Mackay told him he sailed from Holland\r\nto the Canaries two years as an English Man, and that he never sailed\r\nunder Dutch Colours till the War with Spain; That Capt. Mackay told\r\nhim that the Sloop at the time of the Capture belong'd to Mr. Devernet\r\nof Amsterdam and his two sons who lived at Teneriffe, who were all\r\nFrenchmen. That to his knowledge he never saw any of the Cargo Landed\r\nat Madera; that his Lieu't Immediately upon the Capture brought the\r\nPapers of the said Vessell to him, who having first perused them\r\nSealed them up; that some short time after the said Mackay exprest to\r\nhim his Desire, in case a certain Paper was found on board, that it\r\nwould be useless to this Depon't, and that he would have it Concealed,\r\nwhereupon this Depon't asked him what the Paper was and where in the\r\nVessell it could be found, but the said Mackay would not inform him,\r\nand this desire of the said Mackays he repeated several times, and in\r\nabout two Days after there was brought to this Depon't by John Teit,\r\nwho acted as Mate on board the said Prize, two Papers from on Board,\r\nviz. an English Mediterranean Pass wherein the said Master and Sloop\r\nwas named, and a Spanish Clearance as of an English Vessell, which was\r\nfound as he said as mentioned by this Depon't in his former\r\nExaminat'n, and afterwards the said Mackay repeated his Desire in case\r\na certain Paper, not naming it, should be found not to show it to\r\nany--Whereupon this Depon't Informed him that he had got what he meant\r\nand shew'd him the said Pass and Clearance, and then the said Master\r\nagain pressed him not to shew the same to the Consul. That upon his\r\narrival at Madera he Delivered the Papers so found and Seal'd up,\r\ntogether with the said Pass and Spanish Clearance, to Capt. Dumaresq\r\nin the Consul's House, that Capt. Dumaresq then delivered them to the\r\nConsul, who broke open the Seal and perused the Papers together with\r\nCapt. Dumaresq; and that he verily believes the Papers now in Court\r\nare all the Papers he so delivered up, excepting the said Pass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The British consul at Funchal, Richard Baker; see docs.\r\nnos. 140, 141.]\r\n\r\nThe Court was then adjourn'd to the 21st of Aug't Curr't at 7 a Clock\r\na.m., at which time it was opened, when Michael Dumaresq being first\r\nSworn Declar'd that his Examination already taken was the Truth. He\r\nfurther Declared that when Capt. Dumaresq arrived at Gibraltar he\r\nheard him say he wou'd go to the Govern'r,[14] to the Admiral,[15] and\r\nto the Judge of the Admiralty, that accordingly he saw the Captain go\r\nto Sir Chaloner Ogle, who was the Admiral, and to the Governour; that\r\nhe heard Capt. Dumaresq Say the Admiral told him he believ'd the\r\nVessell would be condemn'd; and that the Person called the Judge of\r\nAdmiralty at Gibraltar, upon Capt. Dumaresq application to him for a\r\nTryal, told him he had no Commission or Instructions to Try any\r\nCapture but expected the same from England every Day; That upon the\r\narrival of the Sloop _Amsterdam Post_ at Madera there was an officer\r\nput on board her from the Provedore[16] and Judge of the Poor, that he\r\nremain'd on Board till other officers came on Board and unladed the\r\nVessell and that Capt. Dumaresq paid the officer two Bitts[17] a Day\r\nand his Victuals during his Stay on Board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Lieut.-Gen. William Hargrave.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Rear-Adm.

The Court was then adjourn'd to Saterday the\r\n23d Curr't at half an hour past 2 a Clock p.m., at which time it was\r\nopen'd and several Papers were produc'd and Read in Court, which are\r\nas follows, viz.\r\n\r\n\r\n_129.

We hoisted the Jib to try if\r\npossible to clear the Danger, but our Endeavours were fruitless, the\r\nJib gave way so that We had no Sail left but the Fore Sail, and\r\nnothing appeared in our View but Unavoidable Death. We had the\r\nBreakers on each side and an Opening seemed to be ahead. We bore up\r\nfor it and drop't an anchor, which did not hold, the Rocks and\r\nBreakers being all round us and the Night excessive Dark added Dread\r\nto the Terrours of Death, But the Mercifull God opened a Door of\r\nSafety for us when We were in the utmost Distress, for as We were\r\ngoing Right in among the Rocks We see a small opening on the Larboard\r\nhand. We hoisted the Fore Sail and Cut the Cable and Looft[4] into the\r\nOpening and were Immediately aground in a very smooth sandy Cove. at\r\nseven in the Morning when it cleared for Day We see some People on the\r\nShore.

September 1, 1740._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Court proceedings here resumed, after insertion of\r\ndocuments in the record.]\r\n\r\nCapt. Dixon, who Translated the Several Spanish Papers aforewritten,\r\nmade Oath in Court that he had Translated them according to the best\r\nof his Skill and Judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Court was then Adjourn'd to the 25th Curr't at 8 a Clock A.M., at\r\nwhich Time it was Opened and both Parties fully heard by their\r\nadvocates, after which the Court was Adjourn'd to the Thirtieth Curr't\r\nat 10 a Clock a.m., at which Time the Judge Decreed the Vessell and\r\nCargo a Lawfull Prize, and on the first of September following\r\ndelivered his Reasons for Adjudication in Open Court, which is as\r\nfollows, viz.\r\n\r\nI have duly Considered the Preparatory Examinations and all the Papers\r\nand Writings which were Sworn to be found and taken in and with the\r\nCapture (a Mediterranean Pass excepted) and also the Depositions given\r\nin Open Court, and likewise with great Deliberation weighed the\r\nArguments of the Advocates, as well on the part of the Captor as on\r\nthe part of the Claimant, and it appears to Me that the Sloop Libelled\r\nagainst was a British Bottom, Navigated by British Subjects, and that\r\nthe Master thereof, AEneas Mackay, on the 11th of July, 1738, had\r\nGranted to him for said Sloop by the Right Hono'ble the Lords\r\nCommissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of Great\r\nBritain a Mediterranean Pass No. 2533, which was found on board the\r\nsaid Sloop at the Time of the Capture. It also appears to Me that the\r\nsaid Master, on the 16th Septr., 1739, by the Name of AEneas Mackay of\r\nLondon, Captain, took the usual Oath of a Porter of the City of\r\nAmsterdam; that on the 22d of said Month the said Master before the\r\nMagistrates and Rulers of that City made oath that the Vessell\r\naforesd., of which he was then Master, belonged to a House in that\r\nProvince and afterwards the said Vessell in Holland as to her\r\nClearing, Passport, Visiting, Taxing, etc., was Treated as a Dutch\r\nBottom; that on the 2d of Octobr. following the said Master hired a\r\nChamber in Amsterdam _for one year_, But in case no one appeared in\r\nOctober following then it should be in the power of the Lessor to Lett\r\nthe same to another, and he Enter'd the Day following, and shortly\r\nafter sailed in said Vessell to Teneriffe, from whence in a few Days\r\nhe and his hands, British Subjects, and after the Proclamation of War,\r\nwith Two Passes, viz. the said Mediterranean Pass and a Dutch Pass,\r\nsailed to Cork in the Kingdom of Ireland, having a Great quantity of\r\nMoney, as appears by his Journal; there he purchases a Loading,\r\nChiefly Provisions, Clears out for the Maderas, and accordingly had\r\none Sett of Bills of Lading for that Port, to be delivered to William\r\nCallanach or to his assigns, who to Me appears to be a fictitious\r\nPerson, and one other Sett of Bills of Lading for said Cargo to be\r\nDeliverd at the Port of C----[2] unto Divernett Freres, who plainly\r\nappeard to me then to be two Merch'ts Settled Inhabit'ts at Teneriffe,\r\none of them since dead, the other there still Inhabiting; that on the\r\n15th of January, 1739, the said Vessell was taken, as set forth in the\r\nLibel, with the said Papers and the Books of Acco'ts of the said\r\nMaster, and by which acco'ts it turns out to my Satisfaction if those\r\ntwo Brothers the Devernets were not solely Owners they were\r\nPrincipally so. It further appears that the reason assigned by the\r\nMaster, when taken, of being so near Teneriffe and setting in for that\r\nPort was for Water, when in Truth it's in Proof they were Letting out\r\ntheir Water Secretly, and after Stopt by the Captors there was Water\r\nfor one hand more than the Crew belonging to the Sloop for three\r\nWeeks, which carried them into Madera, and if the Say of some of the\r\nSailors is to be Credited they were Shipped at Corke for Teneriffe;\r\nand all this to Demonstration Shews which of those two Setts of Bills\r\nof Lading must be understood to be Real. It also appears in Proof,\r\ncertifyed under the hand of the British Consul at Madera (whose name\r\nthereto subscrib'd is owned by the Claimant to be of his proper\r\nhandwriting), that the said Cargo was there by force Unloaded, by\r\nMeans Whereof not brought with the Vessell to this Port, So that in\r\nfine here is a British Master endeavouring to Commence Dutchman, a\r\nBritish Vessell with two Passes, British and Dutch, and to be\r\noccasionally[3] either a British or Dutch Bottom Navigated by British\r\nSubjects in time of War with Spain, Sails from Teneriffe with Money to\r\nCork in Ireland, there purchases a Cargo of Provisions bound directly\r\nback to our Enemies, makes a false Clearance as if bound to Madera,\r\nhas two Setts of Bill of Lading, the One which is Real to Deliver the\r\nCargo at a Port part of the Dominions of a Prince in Enmity with us,\r\nand to Persons there Inhabiting who appear to be altogether or\r\nPrincipally owners, Carrying the King's Subjects to Enemies, whereby\r\nthey by Menaces or Corruption or both may be drawn from their\r\nAllegiance, and happily is thus taken, and to have it a Question\r\nwhether it's a Lawfull Capture or not is somewhat Extraordinary, for\r\nmy part till I am better Informed from Home I shall never Ballance in\r\nCases so Wickedly Contrived and contrary to the Conduct of plain\r\nTrading and Simple Honesty, But in Justice to my King and Country\r\nalways Condemn, and if this Mackay was in Court, notwithstanding all\r\nhis Subtlety and Double Dealing and his pretended Naturalization\r\nCertifyed from Teneriffe, as in the Case, I should order him in\r\nCustody till delivered up to the Government. Therefore on the whole I\r\nAdjudge and Condemn the Vessell and Cargo Libelled against as a\r\nLawfull Prize, Entirely to belong to and be Divided between and among\r\nthe Owners of the Sloop that Seized and Took her as aforesaid, and the\r\nseveral Persons which were on Board the same, in such Shares and\r\nProportions as were agreed on with the Owners aforesd. and the persons\r\nthus entituled thereto by virtue of such agreement among themselves.\r\nAnd as to the Objection that the Cargo is not brought in the Vessell,\r\nthe Manner of it's being forced from the Captor is Certified, and that\r\nthis Court may notwithstanding proceed to Condemnation is not only the\r\npractice of the Court, but so known in the Kings Court, as in the\r\nCases the King v. Broom, Brown and Burton v. Francklyn.[4]\r\n\r\nROB'T.

The case of Brown and Burton\r\n_vs._ Franklyn (Hilary term, 10 Will. III.) was similar. Brown and\r\nBurton were masters of two ships of the East India Company, who had\r\ntaken a rich French prize at the island of Johanna (see doc. no. 58,\r\nnote 3) and taken the goods for themselves and left the ship there,\r\nwithout going to the trouble of having it properly condemned as prize.\r\nThe case is reported in Carthew, p. 474.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE _REVENGE_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_144.

We\r\nthen tyed him to a Gun and made the Doctor Come with Instruments\r\nSeemingly to Castrate him as they had Served the English, thinking by\r\nthat means to Gett some Confession out of him, but he still denyed it.\r\nwe then tyed a Molatto one that was taken with him to know if he knew\r\nanything about the Matter. We Gave him a dozen of Stripes and he\r\ndeclared that he knew nothing more than his being Capt. of a Comp'y\r\natt that time but that the other fellow on board the Sloop knew all\r\nabout it. We Sent to him and he declared the wholle truth that it was\r\nthe Florida Indians that had Committed the fact Under his Comand, but\r\nknew not if he was Consenting to it. However to make Sure and to make\r\nhim Remember that he bore such a Commission we Gave him 200 Lashes and\r\nthen pickled him and left him to the Doctor to take Care of his Sore\r\nA-se.

One\r\nof Ships brought too and fired a Gun to wait for a Sloop that was in\r\nComp'y with her, and to wait for Us. We took in all Our Small Sails\r\nand bore down to her and hoisted Our penant. When alongside of her\r\nshe fired 6 Shot att Us but did Us no damage, We still Hedging upon\r\nher and Gave her Our broadside and then stood off. The Sloop tackt\r\nimediatly and bore down upon Us in hopes to Gett Us between the Ships,\r\nAs We Suppose to peper Us, Att the Sight of Which We Gave them three\r\nChears. Our people all Agreed in General to fight them and told the\r\nCapt. if heed venture his Sloop they'd Venture their Lives, but the\r\nCapt. Seemed Unwilling and Gave for Reason that the prizes of which he\r\nwas in possession of woud be of little profitt if taken by Us for we\r\ncoud only Come in for a share w'ch woud be allow'd Us by the Court,\r\nand that perhaps woud not make Good a Limb if it was Lost, also that\r\nWe had not hands Sufficient to Man them, and to bring those Vessells\r\nto providence. no one was able to buy any part of them and to Carry\r\nthem to the No'ward woud be the breaking up of the Voyage without\r\nprofitt. Nevertheless We Lett the Sloop Come alongside Us and Received\r\nher Shott. We Gave her a broadside and a Volley of Small Arms with\r\nthree Huzas, then bore down to the Ship, who all this time had been\r\npelting Us with her Shot but to no purpose, and Gave her another broad\r\nSide which did her some damage, for she bore down to the Sloop and\r\nnever fired one more Shott, but Gott her on the Careen and men over\r\nthe Side to Stop her holes, also Severall hands att her Rigging to\r\nmend it, her Sails being full of Shott holes, as also those of the\r\nSloop. All the damage we Gott was One Shott through Our Main Sail. The\r\nShip mounted 6 Guns of a Side and the Sloop 8. She was a Spanish\r\nprivateer that had been Cruizing to the No'ward and had taken 5 Ships\r\nand that Sloop which We took some time before.[50] It Grieved Us to\r\nthink that that felow shoud Go off with those prizes which he woud not\r\nhave done had the Capt. been as willing as We.

Benj'n Norton and Comp'y in a private Sloop\r\n     of War Called the _Revenge_ July the 28th, and brought into\r\n     this Court for Condemnation, As Capt. QMr. I appear in\r\n     behalf of the Owners, Capt. and Comp'y to prove that the\r\n     said Sloop and Cargo togather with the three Mollattos and\r\n     one Negro, all Slaves belonging to some of the Vessells or\r\n     Subjects of the King of Spain, ought to be Condemned for the\r\n     benefit and Use of the Captures as aforesd.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 60: Captors.]\r\n\r\n     I'm Certain I'm Undertaking a taske no ways Qualifyed for\r\n     it, But as I have Leave to speak in a Court instituted by\r\n     the Laws of England and before a Judge whom Im Certain is\r\n     Endued with the strictest Honour and Justice I dont doubt\r\n     that if through Ignorance I shoud omit any proof that woud\r\n     be of advantage to Us Your Honour will be so Good as to Aid\r\n     and Assist me in it.\r\n\r\n     It will be needless, I believe, S'r, to bring any further\r\n     proof than what has been already bro't and Sworn too in\r\n     Court to prove the Right and power we had in Seizing this\r\n     Sloop and Cargo on the high Seas and bringing of her here\r\n     for Condemnation. There is a Late Act of parliament made in\r\n     the 12 y'r of his present Majestys Reign,[61] wherein it\r\n     says that all Vessells belonging to his Majestys Subjects of\r\n     Great Britain or Irel'd that shall be taken by the Ennemy\r\n     and have been in their possession the Space of 96 hours if\r\n     Retaken by any private man of War the Captures shall be\r\n     Intituled to the one half for Salvage free from all Charges.\r\n     As this [h]as been fully proved in Court that the time the\r\n     Ennemy [h]as had her in possession is above 96 hours I dont\r\n     doubt but the one half free of all Charges will be allotted\r\n     Us for Salvage.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 61: Not 12, but 13 Geo. II., ch. 4, sect. 18. The\r\n     recaptors were entitled to one-eighth for salvage if the\r\n     vessel had been in enemy possession 24 hours, a fifth if\r\n     24-48 hours, a third if 48-96, a half if 96.]\r\n\r\n     The thing in dispute is the three Mollatos and one Negro,\r\n     all Slaves taken on board the prize, said to belong to some\r\n     of Vassalls or Subjects of the King of Spain and is by this\r\n     Court put to Us too prove they are so, which hope to do by\r\n     some Circumstances and the Insufficiency of the Evidence in\r\n     their favour which amounts to nothing more than hearsay.\r\n\r\n     The first Evidence in their favour is that of John Evergin,\r\n     a Native of No.Carolina,[62] who professes himself to be a\r\n     Child of the Spirit, who for the Value of a Share in April\r\n     last having been taken prisoner by the said Don Pedro\r\n     Estrado and brought to St. Augustine did Consent to pillott\r\n     them in the Bowells of his Native Country and betrayed them\r\n     to that Cruel and Barbarous Nation. Can Your Honour Confide\r\n     in a Man who has betrayed his Countrymen, Robbed them of\r\n     their Lives and also what are dearer to them their Liberty,\r\n     One who has Exposed his Bretheren to Eminent Dangers and\r\n     Reduced them and their familys to Extream wants by fire and\r\n     Sword? Can the Evidence, I say, of so vile a Wretch who has\r\n     forfeited his Leige to his King by Entring in the Ennemys\r\n     Service, and unnaturally sold his Countrymen, be of any\r\n     weight in a Court of Justice? No, Im Certain, and I hope it\r\n     will meet with None to prove that these Slaves are freemen\r\n     for all that he as [has] said as he owns was only but\r\n     hearsay. The other Evidence is of a Villain of another Stamp\r\n     a French Runnagado, Juan Baptist Domas. his Evidence is so\r\n     Contrary to the Questions askt Francisco and Aug'ne that I\r\n     hope it will meet with the same fate as the first deserves\r\n     not to be Regarded. I'll own he has sworn to it, but how? On\r\n     a peice of a Stick made in the shape of a thing they name a\r\n     Cross, Said to be blest and Sanctyfyed by the poluted words\r\n     and hands of a wretched priest, a Spawn of the whore of\r\n     Babylon, who is a Monster of Nature and a Servant to the\r\n     Devill, Who for a Riall will pretend to absolve them from\r\n     perjury, Incest and parricide, and Cannonize them for\r\n     Cruelties Committed to we Herreticks, as they stile us, and\r\n     Even Rank them in the Number of those Cursed Saints who by\r\n     their Barbarity have Rendered their Names Immortall and\r\n     Odious to all true Beleivers. tis by such Devills they Swear\r\n     and to them they pray. Can then Your Hon'r Give Credit to\r\n     such Evidence, who no doubt they had agreed between them\r\n     that he should swear they were free, which he might Easily\r\n     do, for no Question but they told him so: and to swear it\r\n     was but a trifle when absolution Can be Gott so cheap. It\r\n     does not stand to Reason that Slaves who are in hopes of\r\n     Getting their freedom wou'd own they are so. Does not their\r\n     Complextion and features tell all the world that they are of\r\n     the blood of Negroes and have suckt Slavery and Cruelty from\r\n     their Infancy? Can any one think when we Call to mind that\r\n     barbarous Action Committed to his Majestys Brave Subjects\r\n     att the Retaken of the fort att St. Augustine, Occasioned by\r\n     the treachery of their Vile Gen'l who Sacrificed them to\r\n     that Barbarous Colour, that it was done by any that had the\r\n     Least drop of blood Either of Liberty or Christianity in\r\n     them? No, Im Confident Your Hon'r cant think so, No not Even\r\n     of their Gov'r under whose vile Commission this was Suffered\r\n     to be done and went unpunisht Headed by this Francisco that\r\n     Cursed Seed of Cain, Curst from the foundation of the world,\r\n     who has the Impudence to Come into Court and plead that he\r\n     is free. Slavery is too Good for such a Savage, nay all the\r\n     Cruelty invented by man will never make amends for so vile a\r\n     proceeding and if I may be allowed to Speak freely, with\r\n     Submission, the torments of the world to Come will not\r\n     Suffice. God forgive me if I Judge Unjustly. What a\r\n     miserable State must a Man be in who is Under the\r\n     Jurisdiction of that vile and Cruel Colour. I pity my poor\r\n     fellow Creatures, whom many have been made prisoners this\r\n     War and some lately that have been sent to the Avanah, and\r\n     all by the treachery of that vile fellow John Evergin who\r\n     says he's posse'd with the Spirit of the Inward man but was\r\n     possessed with the Spirit of Belzebub when he pillotted the\r\n     Cursed Spaniards over the barr of Obricock as it has been\r\n     proved in Court.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 62: John Everigin is recorded as a Quaker, in the\r\n     roll of Capt. Benjamin Palmer's company of the militia\r\n     regiment of Pasquotank County, North Carolina, in 1755.\r\n     _N.C. State Records_, XXII. 350.]\r\n\r\n     I dont doubt but this Tragical Act Acted att St. Augustine\r\n     has Reacht home before now. This Case may perhaps travell as\r\n     farr. when they'l Remember the Sufferings of their\r\n     Countrymen Under the Command of this Francisco whom we have\r\n     Gott in possession with some of his Comp'y who were\r\n     Concern'd with him and Under his Command in that inhuman\r\n     fact they will agree no doubt, as I hope Your Honour will,\r\n     that they must be Slaves and no others Concern'd in it, So\r\n     hope that by the Contradictions which has been shewn in\r\n     Court Concerning this Juan Baptista Domas, who affirms he\r\n     never saw them till on board the privateer, and Francisco\r\n     and Aug'ne both woud prove that they knew him some months\r\n     before and Converst with him, is proof Enough they are\r\n     Slaves and hope that by the old Law of Nations, where it\r\n     Says that all prisoners of War, nay Even their posterity are\r\n     Slaves, that by that Law Pedro Sancho and And'w Estavie will\r\n     be decreed as Such for the Use of the Captures. So shall\r\n     Rest it with your Hon'r.\r\n\r\nThen the Judge Gave his Decree that the Sloop and Cargo shoud be sold\r\natt Vandue and the one half thereof shoud be p'd the Captures for\r\nSalvage, free from all Charges, that Juan Baptisto Domas, Pedro Sanche\r\nand And'w Estavie, According to the Laws of England shoud Remain as\r\nprisoners of War till Ransomed, And that Augustine and Francisco\r\naccording to the Laws of the plantations shoud be Slaves and for the\r\nuse of the Captures. So the Court broke up.\r\n\r\n_Thursday 20th._ Opened a bb. of beef. This day the Vandue begun. Sold\r\n46 bbs. of pork, 29 bb. of Beef and 110 bus. of Corn, then Adjourn'd\r\nit till the next day att 8 of the Clock.\r\n\r\n_Friday 21._ This day made an End of Selling the Cargo of the prize.\r\nSold 55 bus. of corn, 41 bbs. of pork, 6 bb. of beef, 13 bbs. of Tarr,\r\n11 bbs. of pitch, 4 bbs. of Oyle. then Sett up Seignior Capt.\r\nFransisco Under the Name of Don Blass who was Sold to Mr. Stone for 34\r\nps. 8.

So that after Severall brisk Shott on both\r\n     Sides she Struck. Our Rigging, Mast and Gunnell Received\r\n     some damage. Upwards of 25 Shott went through Our Sails. 2\r\n     Shott went through Our mast and in the weakest part Just\r\n     below where it was fisht. a Shott Cut our fore Shrewd[91] on\r\n     the Larboard side and another went through Our Starboard\r\n     Gunnell, port and all.

The poor Capt. of\r\n     the privateer was wounded in the Arm and the bone fractured,\r\n     One Negro boy Killed and others wounded. He was fitted out\r\n     last Novem'r att the Avanah and went to St. Aug'ne and was\r\n     on Our Coast Early in the Spring and took severall Vessells\r\n     as per list herein inclosed. he was again fitted out in\r\n     August last and had been on the Coast again and had taken\r\n     Severall more Vessells, as you will Observe by the Acct.,\r\n     but we had the Good fortune to Stop his Cruize.

Lee and Tyler of Boston, both Under the\r\n     State of Conviction Since the Gospell of Whitefield and\r\n     Tennant [h]as been propagated in New England,[92] So that we\r\n     are in hopes they will Readily Give a Just Acct. of her\r\n     Cargo and her true Value and Render to Caesar the things\r\n     that are Caesars, which is the Moral preachd by Whitefield.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 92: An allusion to the \"Great Awakening\", and to\r\n     the revivalist preaching of George Whitefield in Boston in\r\n     the autumn of 1740 and of Gilbert Tennent in the ensuing\r\n     winter. Tyler at any rate (John Tyler of Boxford and Boston)\r\n     seems certainly to have been affected by the \"New Light\"\r\n     movement, for in 1745 the Second Church in Boxford suspended\r\n     him, among others, for \"receiving into their houses\r\n     Itinerant Preachers and holding meetings in opposition to\r\n     the repeated entreaties of their Brethren\". _The Tyler\r\n     Genealogy_, I. 43.]\r\n\r\n     As this will Require a Law Suit I hope You'l Gett the best\r\n     Advice You possibly Can and Gett her Seized if att Boston or\r\n     Else Where and Gett her Condemned.

Smith on board his Own Brig't with his Company, and This\r\nDepon't was also Ordered by the Quarter master and Company of the\r\n_Revenge_ Sloop to go on board said Briganteen to Secure and look\r\nafter their Interest, With Orders to keep them Company Untill some\r\nfarther Disposition shou'd be Made, which was Intended to be done the\r\nnext day, but so it happened by Some Misadventure or Contrivance to\r\nthis Depon't unknown they never Coul'd come up with the Sloops again\r\n(th'o they had Severall times sight of Them), Whereupon the said Smith\r\nand Company Alledging they shou'd be short Of Provisions Steer'd their\r\nCourse towards Rhoad Island and in About Eight days After, in the\r\nGulph of Florida,[4] we Came up with a large Merchant man as deep\r\nLaden as she Cou'd well Swim, she Standing in For the Westward and we\r\nbeing very near the florida shore Cou'd not Weather her and when she\r\ncame up with us she fired a shot Over us, Upon which we brought too\r\nand then Ordered us to Come on board them In Our boat, but upon our\r\ntelling them we had no boat they sent their Boat on board us with\r\ntheir Pilot and Severall Others, who staid on board That night and the\r\nnext day. about the midle of the Afternoon they Left us After haveing\r\nplundered the Brig't of One barrell of Sugar, three Small Sails, a\r\nSheet and Small Anchor, the sheet Cable[5] and Sundry Small Stores of\r\nlittle or no Value. Whereupon Capt. Smith took upon him to Order The\r\nBrigantine to Boston, Capt. Smith at the same time telling this\r\nDepon't He shou'd have mates Wages, And upon their passage Comeing\r\nnear Block Island, Capt. Smith refus'd to go into Rhoad Island th'o\r\nRequested by the Depon't And Afterwards they put into Martha's\r\nVineyard, where Capt. Smith Sold Rum and Other things to Cloath his\r\npeople and then made his best Way for Boston where they arrived on or\r\nabout the 23d of October last When they discharged this Depon't as\r\nsoon as they well Cou'd and gave him Some money and told him to Go\r\nabout his business.\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH HARIMAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Commonly called the Old Bahama Channel, lying between the\r\nJardines del Rey, or north coast of Camaguey province, Cuba, and the\r\nGreat Bahama Bank.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lower corner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The part of the Atlantic Ocean east of northern Florida.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The cable used with the sheet-anchor.]\r\n\r\n1741 Nov'r 25 Jeremiah Hariman Appearing in the Registers Office made\r\nOath to the Truth of the Aforegoing Deposition Before Me\r\n\r\nROB'T AUCHMUTY Judge Ad'y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_149. Deposition of Thomas Smith. November 30, 1741._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Records of the Admiralty Court held in Boston, \"vol.

That on the 17th day of Septem'r\r\nlast he being Master of said Brigantine in her Passage from Barbadoes,\r\nin the Lat. of 28 Degrees and 38 min's North and the Long. of Bermuda,\r\nsaid Briganteen Was Surprized and taken together with her Cargo\r\nConsisting of Rum, Sugar, Cotton and money to the Value of About\r\nEighty Six Pounds Sterling by divers Subjects of the King of Spain in\r\na Privateer Sloop mounted with Sixteen Guns Commanded by One Capt.\r\nPonch[2] manned with upwards of Forty men, who took Out of the said\r\nBriganteen all the Aforesaid Money and Continued all the Rest Of the\r\nCargo on Board of her, and the said Spanish Privateer Ordered the\r\nDepon't And four of his men on board the said Sloop and put some of\r\ntheir men on board The said Briganteen and turned her Long boat adrift\r\nand the said Sloop and Briganteen were Ordered to Keep Company with\r\nOne Another and Steer for the Havannah and the Spaniards plundered\r\nsaid Briganteen both of Rum and Sugar And on the 26th of said\r\nSeptem'r, said Briganteen being in the Old Streights of Bahama, Capt.\r\nBenjamin Norton in a Privateer Sloop from Rhoad Island Came up with\r\nthe Aforesaid Spanish Privateer and the Depo'ts Briganteen, Took the\r\nPrivateer and Retook the Brig't and Cargo and the said Norton took All\r\nthe Spaniards out of said Sloop and Brig't and put them on board his\r\nOwn Sloop and the Depon't Saith that Capt. Norton's Quarter master\r\ntook out of his Brig't Some Cloaths, a Rug and Blankett, which was\r\nupon freight, Contrary to this Depo'ts Request, who told him said\r\nthings were upon freight, and said Quarter Master also took from this\r\nDepon't forty pieces of Eight. Capt. Norton then Ordered this Depon't\r\non board his Own Brig't with his own men and ordered the Depo't to\r\nkeep him Company and Proceed to Rhoad Island. at The same time One\r\nJeremiah Hariman, one of Capt. Norton's men, came on board The said\r\nBriganteen, but the wind being fresh and a very strong Current Setting\r\nCapt. Norton Outsailed the Brig't, who fell to Leward on the Bahama\r\nBanks[3] In About five fathom water and lost Sight of Capt. Norton for\r\ntwentyfour Hours and then Stood for the Gulph,[4] designing for Rhoad\r\nIsland, but in their Passage thither on the fourth day of October at\r\nTen a Clock in the morning, being in the Lat. of 27 Deg's and 6 min's,\r\nthe Depon't met with a Spanish Merch't Ship mounted with about Six\r\nGuns and Navigated with About Twenty five Men in the Gulph, Commanded\r\nby one Barnard Espinosa who was also Owner of said Ship, who came from\r\nthe Havannah and was bound for the Canaries, Who took and made Prize\r\nof this Depon'ts Vessell and Cargo, put this Depon't and His men on\r\nboard the said Spanish Ship and put his Own men on board the\r\nBriganteen to plunder her, and the said Ships Crew took Away the said\r\nBriganteens Jib, forestaysail, Sheet Cable and Anchor, five Great\r\nGuns, four small Arms, Maintopstaysail, Runners and [_illegible_]\r\nStream Anchor,[5] two crows and all the Iron they could remove, and\r\nalso some Sugar, Rum, Cotton, Wool, two coils of Rigging, and Sundry\r\nStores Particularly mentioned in a Schedule, Lodged in Court, and also\r\ntook of the said Briganteens Cargo five packets of Cotton, two\r\nhogsheads and half of Rum, One hogshead and four barrells of Sugar and\r\nSeven hundred weight of Loaf Sugar, and also Carried with Him in said\r\nShip the mate, one hand and a Boy belonging to said Brig'n, In Order\r\nto Carry them into the Territories of the King of Spain to Shew That\r\nthe Vessell and Cargo so Plundered belonged to British Subjects, and\r\nOn the 5th of said October the said Espinosa gave this Depon't his\r\nsaid Briganteen at the Request of a Spanish Priest he had on board (he\r\nHaveing at first determined to set her on fire) as also the Remains of\r\nher Cargo, vizt. five hogsheads and half of Rum, four hogsheads and\r\nEight Teirces of Sugar, belonging to the Owners of said Briganteen,\r\nwhich he has Since delivered to them, and nine hogsheads of Sugar,\r\nfive Packets of Cotton and a Teirce of Rum which were Laden Upon\r\nfreight, which he has since delivered to the Respective Owners, vizt.\r\nthe nine hogsheads of Sugar to Wentworth and Monk, the five Packets of\r\nCotton to Mr. John Woodhouse, and the Teirce of Rum to Capt.

Decree of Vice-Admiralty Judge. December 7, 1741._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Records of the Admiralty Court, Boston, \"vol. V.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Case was then fully debated by the Advocates[2] on both sides and\r\non the Seventh of Decemb'r Aforesaid his Honour the Judge gave the\r\nfollowing Decree, vizt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In English admiralty courts the two classes of\r\nlawyers--roughly, those who appeared in court and those who prepared\r\nthe papers--were called advocates and proctors, corresponding to\r\nbarristers and attorneys in the common-law courts.]\r\n\r\nThis Case on the Evidence Appears to me shortly to stand thus: On the\r\n17th day of Sept'r last the Briganteen _Sarah_ in her Passage from\r\nBarbadoes to Boston was taken by a Spanish Privateer. on the 26th of\r\nsaid Month Capt. Norton in an English Privateer took the Spaniard and\r\nhis said Prize, puts one of his hands on board of the Briganteen and\r\nContinues Mr. Smith the Master and his Crew belonging to her on board,\r\nOrdering him to keep him Company and Proceed to Rhoad Island, but the\r\nBriganteen Not being Able to keep up with the English Privateer lost\r\nsight of her, And in her Passage for Rhoad Island on the 4th of\r\nOctober was again taken By a Spanish ship, who plundered her the\r\nsecond time and Carrying with them the Mate, One hand and a Boy, on\r\nthe 5th of October Aforesaid was prevail'd upon to Give the Briganteen\r\nwith the Remains of her Cargo, etc. to the said Smith the Master, who\r\nbrought her to Boston, and now the Owners of the English Privateer and\r\nCapt. Norton and his Crew demand one half for Salvage according to the\r\nStat. In that Case (as they say) provided, and if they are Entitled to\r\nthe Same is the Sole Question. In determining of which I shall Premise\r\n\r\n1st. Its a Rule in Law that the Right of Changeing Property by force\r\nof Arms is so Odious that in the takeing of Goods if by any\r\nPossibility The Right Owner may have Restitution the same shall be\r\ndone, and th'o a Larger time than twenty four hours happen between the\r\nCapture And Recapture, and so may pernoctare[3] with the Captor yet\r\nRestitution may be made.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Continue through the night.]\r\n\r\n2 ly. The Sense and Understanding the Law hath of Privateers, vizt.\r\nThat they Are such as receive no pay but go to war at their Own\r\ncharge, and Instead of pay leave is granted to Keep what they can take\r\nfrom the Enemy, and alth'o such License is Granted yet may they not of\r\ntheir Own heads Convert to their Private use Prizes before the same\r\nhave Been Adjudged by Law Lawfull to the Captors.\r\n\r\n3 ly. There are Two Adjudged Cases that may Contribute to the Clearing\r\nup this Point. The First is in the War between England and Holland.[4]\r\na Dutch man of war takes an English Merchant man and Afterwards an\r\nEnglish man of war Meets the Dutchman of war and his Prize and in\r\nAperto Prelio[5] regains the Prize. there Restitution is made, the\r\nOwners paying Salvage, _for had it been a Lawfull Prize to the\r\nRecaptor the Admiral wou'd have had a Tenth_. The Second is where a\r\nShip Chartered in his Voyage happens to be taken By An Enemy, and\r\nAfterwards in Battle is Retaken by Another ship in Amity, And\r\nRestitution is made and she proceeds on her Voyage. the Contract is\r\nnot Determined. th'o the taken[6] by the Enemy divested the Property\r\nout of the Owners, Yet by the Law of War the Possession was\r\ndefeazable, and being Recovered by battle Afterwards, the Owners\r\nbecame Reinvested, so the Contract by [fiction] of Law became as if\r\nshe never had been taken and so the Entire freight Became due.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: It is difficult to identify these cases, for volumes of\r\nreports of admiralty decisions were not published until the beginning\r\nof Christopher Robinson's _Reports_ in 1798, and not many earlier\r\ndecisions have since been reported; but the first of the cases here\r\nreferred to may be one of the two, those of the _Laurel Tree_ and the\r\n_Palm Tree_, on which Sir Leoline Jenkins rendered, in 1672, opinions\r\nwhich are printed in Wynne's _Life of Sir Leoline Jenkins_, II. 770.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Open battle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Taking.]\r\n\r\nLastly, I Observe the Words of the Stat. in the Case of Recaption[7]\r\nAgree with the Words of the Law in the Cases put, for the words In the\r\nAct are _shall be adjudged to be Restored to Such former Owner, etc.\r\nPaying in Lieu of Salvage, etc._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: 13 Geo. II. ch. 4, sect. 18.]\r\n\r\nThese things thus Premised I Come to the Consideration of the Point\r\nbefore me, and am of Opinion the Prepon'ts are Not Entituled to Any\r\nSalvage, for that the Owners were never Absolutely Divested of their\r\nProperty, as may fairly be Collected from what has been Before\r\nmentioned. Its true the Prepon'ts had a Right or Claim to Salvage On\r\nthe Recaption, but before that right Cou'd be Adjudged lawfull to the\r\nRecaptors the Briganteen was again taken by a Spaniard, which puts an\r\nEntire End to Salvage for a former Recaption, because Retakeing and\r\nRestitution begets Salvage but the Prepon'ts Retakeing is lost by the\r\nEnemies Again takeing the Brig't, and in Fact its the Enemy that made\r\nthe Restitution. Therefore I decree the said Libel to stand dismist,\r\nbut inasmuch as the Prepon'ts have been in Part Instrumental towards\r\nthe Preservation of the said Briganteen and th'o not Strictly Speaking\r\nby Law Entituled to Salvage and the Case being New, I decree the\r\nDef'ts to pay all the Costs.[8]\r\n\r\nROB'T AUCHMUTY, Judge Ad'y.\r\n  7 Decem'r 1741.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: From this decree of Judge Auchmuty the owners of the\r\n_Revenge_ appealed (see docs. no. 151-158), but in vain. Opinions\r\nmight well differ, as did those of the civilians consulted in London,\r\ndoc. no. 153. High authorities declared that when a prize had been\r\ntaken into firm and secure possession, the title of the original\r\nproprietor was completely extinguished, and was not revived by a\r\nrecapture (The _Ceylon_, 1 Dodson 105). But as to English practice,\r\nthe civilians of Doctors' Commons certified in 1678 that the custom of\r\nthe High Court of Admiralty was to restore the recaptured vessel to\r\nthe first proprietor, with salvage of one-eighth to the recaptors\r\n(Marsden, _Law and Custom of the Sea_, II. 102, _cf._ also 168, 193),\r\nand the statute 13 Geo. II. ch. 4, sect. 18, so provides, with\r\nenlargement of salvage when the enemy's possession had lasted longer;\r\nsee doc. no. 145, note 61. But this present case was, or purported to\r\nbe, a case of a _second_ recapture. A note in 4 Chr. Robinson 217\r\nshows three cases in 1778, 1780, and 1781, of British prizes\r\nrecaptured by the French, then captured again by the British; in one\r\ncase the House of Lords awarded the vessel to the first captor, in the\r\nother two to the last. Justice Story, in one of his notes in 2\r\nWheaton, app., p. 46, says, \"Where a hostile ship [_e.g._, Smith's\r\nbrigantine when first encountered by Norton, in Spanish hands] is\r\ncaptured, and afterward is recaptured by the enemy, and is again\r\nrecaptured from the enemy, the original captors [_e.g._, Norton] are\r\nnot entitled to restitution on paying salvage, but the last captors\r\n[_e.g._, Smith] are entitled to all the rights of prize, for, by the\r\nfirst recapture, the whole right of the original captors is devested\";\r\nand he refers to the _Astrea_ (1 Wheaton 125), where Marshall in 1816\r\nso decided, with as much emphasis as Sir Leoline Jenkins laid on an\r\nopposite doctrine in 1672. In 1741 doctrine was in transition from the\r\nearlier to the later view.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_151. Appeal in Prize Case.

May 17, July\r\n10, 1742._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Massachusetts Historical Society.]\r\n\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\nThe English Brigantine called the _Sarah_, Thomas Smith Master,\r\ntogether with her Cargo, consisting of Rum, Sugar, Cotton and money on\r\nBoard, was in her Passage from Barbadoes taken and Seized by a Spanish\r\nPrivateer mounted with Sixteen Guns and Manned with upwards of Forty\r\nMen, who took out of the said Brigantine all the Money, but Continued\r\nall the rest of her Cargo on board of her, and the Spanish Privateer\r\nordered and Caused the Master and Four of the Brigantine's Men to be\r\nput on Board the Privateer and put some of the Privateers Men on Board\r\nthe Brgt. and turned her Long Boat adrift and the Brigantine was\r\nOrdered to keep Company with the Privateer and Steer for the Havannah.\r\nAbout Twenty Leagues from the Havannah, near the Island of Cuba, an\r\nEnglish Privateer Sloop called the _Revenge_ (Benjamin Norton Commr.)\r\ncame up with the said Spanish Privateer in Company with the said\r\nBrigantine, Engaged and took the Said Spanish Privateer and at the\r\nsame time retook the said English Brigantine and Cargo on board, and\r\nCapt. Norton then took all the Spaniards out of the said Spanish\r\nprivatr. and English Brigantine and put them on board his own\r\nPrivateer, and Ordered Thomas Smith, the Master, and Crew of the said\r\nEnglish Brigantine from on Board the Spanish Privateer to be put on\r\nBoard the said Brigantine, and at the same time put on Board her\r\nJeremiah Harimen, One of his own Privateer's Crew, to keep Possession\r\nof her until Salvage Shd. be paid for the Recapture, at the same time\r\nwith Orders to keep the Privateer Company and proceed to Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nSoon after, either by the Contrivance of Thos. Smith, the Master of\r\nthe Brigantine, or by the Wind blowing fresh, the Brigantine was\r\nSeperated or lost Sight of the Privateer.\r\n\r\nThe Brigantine met with a Spanish Ship Mounted with six Guns and\r\nNavigated with about 25 Men, who boarded the Brigantine and Plundred\r\nher and took out of her part of her Rigging, Sails, Cables and\r\nAnchors, and part of her Lading, and the next day they quitted her,\r\nbut first took out of her the Mate, One hand and a Boy, and put them\r\non Board their Spanish Merchant Ship and carried them away.\r\n\r\nCapt. Smith afterwards proceeded with the said Brigantine and in her\r\nPassage coming near Block Island was desired by Jeremiah Harimen (who\r\nwas put on board to keep Possession of her as a fore said) to go into\r\nRhode Island but refused the same and proceeded to Boston, where upon\r\nher arrival the said Jeremiah Harimen was put out of possession of\r\nher, and Thos. Smith, the Master, Caused her Cargo to be unloaded and\r\ndelivered and afterwards to be refitted, without the Least offering to\r\npay any Salvage, under pretence that the Master of the Spanish Mercht.\r\nShip after plundering the Brigantine gave the same to the said Thos.\r\nSmith the Master.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Commr. and Owners of the English Privateer caused the\r\nsaid Ship to be arrested in the Vice Admiralty Court of Boston to\r\nAnswer the said Salvage.\r\n\r\nPleas were given and Admitted and Several Witnesses Exd. on both\r\nsides, and the Judge of Vice Admiralty dismissed the Cause without\r\ngiving any Salvage whatsoever, from which Decree it is Appealed on the\r\nbehalf of the Comr. and Owners of the said English Privateer.\r\n\r\n_Observe._ By the Depo[sitio]ns of the Witnesses there Appears to be\r\nsome Variation relating to the Seizure of the Brigantine by the\r\nSpanish Mercht. Ship. Thos. Smith, Master of the Brigantine, and his\r\nMariners Swear that the Spanish Mercht. Man after seizing and\r\nplundering her gave him the Ship.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Hariman, who was put on board by the English Privateer in\r\nOrder to keep Possesn. of her, differs from them in his depo[sitio]ns.\r\n\r\n_Q._[2] Are not the Owners and Comr. of the English Privateer intitled\r\nto a Moiety of the said Brigantine and her Lading for Salvage by\r\nreason the Brigantine was in Possessn. of the Spanish Privateer above\r\n96 hours before she was retaken, and whether they have not Just Cause\r\nof Appeal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For query, on which the London agents of Freebody and\r\nNorton (see doc. no. 154), or an admiralty proctor acting for them,\r\nsought the opinion of eminent civilians at Doctors' Commons--Dr.\r\nStrahan, Dr. Paul, and Dr. Andrews--for all the practitioners in the\r\nadmiralty and ecclesiastical courts were doctors, of the civil law\r\n(D.C.L., Oxford) or of the civil and canon law (LL.D., Cambridge).]\r\n\r\nIf Capt. Norton, the Commander of the English Privateer, after having\r\nretaken the Brigantine from the Spanish Privateer, had kept possession\r\nof her, and Carried her safe into a British port, he and his Owners\r\nwould have been entitled to Salvage, According to the Directions of\r\nthe Act of Parliament. But as the Brigantine was afterwards taken by\r\nanother Spanish Ship, before she got into Port, and not protected\r\nagainst the Enemy by Capt. Norton, it seems to me very doubtful\r\nwhether he can Claim the Salvage According to the Act of Parliament,\r\nFor Salvage is understood to be a Reward to the Recaptor, who has not\r\nonly rescued the Ship and Cargo out of the hands of the Enemy, but has\r\nalso effectually Secured the same for the benefit of the Owners, till\r\nthe safe Arrival of the Ship in a British Port, Which not having been\r\ndone in the present Case, makes me doubt of Success in an Appeal from\r\nthe Sentence.\r\n\r\nWILL. STRAHAN.[3]\r\n\r\nDOCTRS COMMONS, May 17, 1742.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: An eminent advocate, of Scottish origin, M.A. Edinburgh\r\n1686, D.C.L. Oxford 1709, an advocate from 1710, advocate to the\r\nadmiralty 1741-1748. As to Doctors' Commons, see doc. no. 102, note\r\n2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Evidence given in this Case I am of Opinn. that the\r\nBrigantine the _Sarah_, being taken the 17th of Septemr. 1741 by a\r\nSpanish Privateer in a voyage from Barbados, and retaken on the 26th\r\nof Septemr. 1741 by the Privateer the _Revenge_ from Rhode Island,\r\ncommanded by Capt. Norton, and convey'd to Boston, The Captain of the\r\nPrivateer the _Revenge_ will be well entitled to Salvage for the\r\nBrigantine and her cargo, and the said vessel having been 96 Hours in\r\npossession of the Spaniards, the _Revenge_ Privatr. will be well\r\nentitled to a Moiety of the value of Ship and Cargo.\r\n\r\nThe said Brigantine being seiz'd on the 4th of October by a Spanish\r\nMerchant Ship and plunder'd will not abate the _Revenge's_ Right to\r\nSalvage. If the Spanish Merchant Ship did actually give the Brigantine\r\n(on the 5th of October at the request of a Spanish Priest) to Mr.\r\nThomas Smith, that will not barr the Salvage because such Ship could\r\nhave no property in the Brigantine. I therefore think that there's\r\ngood Reason for an appeal if this Case be truly stated.\r\n\r\nG. PAUL.[4]\r\n\r\nDR. COMMONS, July 10th 1742\r\nCopy\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: George Paul, fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, a\r\nfoundation specially devoted to the civil law, LL.D. Cambridge 1704,\r\nvicar-general to the archbishop of Canterbury 1714-1755, king's\r\nadvocate 1727-1755.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right of Salvage acquir'd by the Recapture of the _Sarah_ Brigt.\r\nwas not, I conceive, extinguished by its being taken again by the\r\nSpanish Merchant Ship, she not being carried _intra praesidia_,[5] but\r\nonly plundered and let go. The Pretence of a Gift thereof to Captn.\r\nSmith can have no weight, for the Spanish Mercht. acquir'd no property\r\nby the Capture and could transfer none to Smith, who has deliver'd the\r\nCargo to the Owners and Freighters, to which he would have had as much\r\nright as to the Ship. As the pretended Gift could transfer no\r\nproperty, it could extinguish no right which had been acquir'd by the\r\n_Revenge_, Except as to such part of the Cargo as was taken away by\r\nthe Spaniard. But the Owners and Company of the _Revenge_ are\r\nintitled to a Moiety of the full Value of the Ship and Cargo, as she\r\narriv'd at Boston, without any Deduction, and I am of Opinion that\r\nthere is just ground of Appeal from the Sentence given in the Court of\r\nAdmiralty there.\r\n\r\nJ.

With the aid of\r\ndocuments found elsewhere, the history of the _Success_ can be pieced\r\nout. Among the records of the vice-admiralty court at Boston there is\r\na thin book of \"Accounts of Sales\", which begins with accounts of\r\nsales of the _Success_ and her cargo, July 22-Oct. 7, 1743, from which\r\nit appears that she was a British vessel, recaptured from the enemy by\r\nthe privateer bilander _Young Eagle_, John Rous commander, the same\r\nprivateer that brought in the _Amsterdam Post_, with its former\r\nlieutenant now commander (doc. no. 128, note 9). Then, in the Rhode\r\nIsland archives, \"Admiralty Papers, 1726-1745\", pp. 63-82, we have the\r\nlibel and other papers in the case of James Allen of the _Revenge_ and\r\nPeter Marshall of the _Success_ against the _Willem_ galley (see doc.\r\nno. 161), which shows one of the successes of this joint cruise to\r\nhave been that, on Mar. 16, 1745, in the Old Bahama Straits, the two\r\nassociates took the ship _Willem_, sailing under Spanish colors and\r\nunder the command of Cosme Zeggrayne (Zegarain), but which originally\r\nwas a Dutch ship, commanded by Pieter Couwenhoven.]\r\n\r\nMemorandum of Agreement indented made and concluded upon the Tenth Day\r\nof November in the Eighteenth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord\r\nGeorge the Second, King of Great Britain etc., Annoq.

The _Willem_ Galley, a\r\nDutch vessel trading between Amsterdam and Curacao, was seized by a\r\nHavana privateer on charges of smuggling, was then retaken by the\r\n_Revenge_ and _Success_, cruising together in consequence of the above\r\nagreement, doc. no. 160, carried into Rhode Island, and condemned as a\r\nprize by the vice-admiralty court there. An appeal was taken.

Drummond, of this Port. She came from\r\nTeneriffe, and had a Pass from the Dutch Consul, but no Dutchmen on\r\nboard: On Account of this Pass, the Governor of Curasoa sent out a\r\nVessel to demand the Prize of Capt. Drummond, but he refus'd to\r\nrestore her, fir'd at the Dutchman and beat him off. Before the Taking\r\nof this Snow, Capt Drummond had taken two Sloops, one was sent into\r\nJamaica and condemn'd there, the other being a good Sailer, he has\r\nfitted out for a Tender, with 30 Men, and Arms suitable, under the\r\nCommand of Capt. Sibbald; she is call'd the _Victory_. On the 16th of\r\nFebruary, the _George_, the _Victory_, and the Prize Snow, being in\r\nCompany off Hispaniola, were chas'd by two Men of War, which they\r\nsuppos'd to be Enemies; the _George_ and _Victory_ left the Prize, and\r\nshe was taken; but the _Victory_ falling in with the Grand English\r\nFleet two Days after, found they were English Men of War, who had\r\ntaken the Prize, and she was restor'd to Capt. Sibbald, by Order from\r\nAdmiral Vernon. The _Victory_ convoy'd her thro' the Windward Passage,\r\nand return'd to look out for the _George_, from whom she Parted in the\r\nChase.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Gazette_ of May 28 chronicles the arrival, May 24, of the sloop\r\n_Victory_, Sibbald, and gives an account of a glorious fight, May 15,\r\nin which Capt. Sibbald, attacked simultaneously by a Spanish ship and\r\nsloop, had beaten both off. His owners rewarded his valor with a\r\npresent of a silver-hilted sword. The _Gazette_ of June 4 adds, \"This\r\nday arrived the _George_ Privateer, belonging to this Place, from\r\nJamaica. Capt. Drummond, who commanded her, died on the Passage\".

And none\r\nappearing to do this, The Court adjourned till Saturday the 13th inst.\r\nat 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\n_June 13th._ The Court met.\r\n\r\nThe Libel read and Proclamation made a second time and Juan Milidony,\r\nthe late Master of the said Snow, being sent for comes into Court, and\r\nJohn Jordan and Patrick Orr, Persons well skilled in the Spanish\r\nLanguage, were sworn faithfully to interpret between the Court and the\r\nsd.

Which being done, notwithstanding the\r\nsd. Milidony did not offer or give the Security required of a Claimer\r\nby the Act of Parliament, The Judge permitted him to view and point\r\nout any Papers he pleased in order to satisfy the Court that it was no\r\nlawfull Prize; which he did without alledging or so much as\r\ninsinuating the Loss or Embezilment of any Papers.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then directed that the Preparatory Examinations should be\r\ntaken, and translations made of the material Papers in order for\r\nTryal.\r\n\r\nAccordingly _June 23d_, the Proofs being prepared,\r\n\r\nThe Court met\r\n\r\nThe Libel read and Proclamation made a third time. William Dowell,[7]\r\nSworn, says That upon the Death of Capt. Drummond he succeeded as next\r\nOfficer in the Command of the _George_ and took possession of the\r\nPrizes Papers and that he hath exhibited the same all into Court\r\nwithout addition, subduction or Embezilment to his knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Captain William Dowell died in 1768, _aet._ 49, \"a good\r\nhusband, a sincere friend, and an honest man\", so says his tombstone\r\nin Christ Church yard. He had an important part in the privateering\r\nexpeditions from Philadelphia in this war. In the _Memoirs_ of Peter\r\nHenry Bruce, chiefly occupied with his service in the Russian army\r\nunder Peter the Great, but ending with a narrative of military\r\nengineering services in the Bahamas and South Carolina, that author\r\ngives an account (pp. 403-408, 421) of the capture of two rich Spanish\r\nprizes in September, 1742, \"by John Sibbald of the _George_ schooner,\r\nand William Dowall, of the _Joseph and Mary_ sloop, both privateers\r\nfrom Philadelphia\", who brought them into New Providence; and he\r\nvehemently accuses Governor Tinker of defrauding them and their\r\nPhiladelphia owners by machinations lasting all through that winter.\r\n\"All our Privateers\", he adds, \"intended to have made this place their\r\ngeneral rendezvous; but the treatment Sibbald and Dowall met with,\r\nprevented any from coming near us\". Later, May, 1744, the journal of\r\nWilliam Black shows Dowell as again commander of the _George_\r\nschooner, 14 carriage and 18 swivel guns, then fitting out in the\r\nDelaware; and in 1746 he commanded the _Pandour_ privateer. _Pa.

That the said Loud behaved himself on board in Such a\r\nmanner, that he was put on board One of His Majestys Ships of warr at\r\nGiberalter for Mutiny, from whence he afterwards found means to run\r\naway, and came to Boston, and applyed himself to your petitioner\r\ntelling him he could Inform him how the Officers of sd.

The Number of her Men they\r\ncould not guess at, being in great Measure cover'd by a Netting, which\r\nSurrounded them; Save that they observ'd em to muster thick on the\r\nQuarter Deck. That not coming a Breast with the Sloop, the Deponents\r\ncould not discover the Number of her Guns, Save, that mr Flood\r\nimagined that he saw two Carriage Guns on her Larboard side.\r\n\r\nThe Deponents further declare that they verily believe that had the\r\nBrigantine Engaged the sloop, the former might easily have taken the\r\nlatter, and that this was the Opinion of their Company in General.\r\n\r\nThey further add, that when orders were given for their bearing off\r\nfrom the Sloop, Capt. Waterhouse declar'd as a reason for so doing\r\nthat his owners enjoyn'd him not to Engage with a Privateer. But that\r\nwhen it was Voted by the Company to pursue the Sloop, he appear'd well\r\npleas'd that the matter was so over ruled, altho' his orders were\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe said Zachariah Foss further adds, that he heard Capt.

Simeon Potter of Bristol (a town in\r\nMassachusetts till January, 1747, in Rhode Island after that date) was\r\none of the most noted and successful of the privateers of his time.\r\nHis raid on French Guiana in November, 1744, though not enormously\r\nprofitable nor of much military importance, makes a very picturesque\r\nstory, chiefly because of the vivid account we have of it from one of\r\nits victims, Father Elzear Fauque, an intelligent Jesuit, who was\r\nserving the mission at Oyapoc, and was carried away as a prisoner by\r\nPotter when he sacked and destroyed that settlement. Father Fauque's\r\nnarrative, a letter to an officer of his society, dated from Cayenne,\r\nDec. 22, 1744, is in the _Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses_, XXVII.\r\n172-250 (Paris 1749), VIII. 387-454 (ed. 1781), IV. 493-533 (ed.\r\n1819), II. 34-50 (ed. 1838). There is an English translation in Bishop\r\nW.I. Kip's _Historical Scenes from the Old Jesuit Missions_ (N.Y.,\r\n1875), pp. 153-205, reprinted in Professor W.H. Munro's _Tales of an\r\nOld Sea Port_ (Princeton, 1917), pp. 48-93, in which Potter's life is\r\nalso told. The admiralty case arose from questions respecting disposal\r\nof the booty.

Later sets, more elaborate, as used in\r\n1798, may be found in Christopher Robinson's _Admiralty Reports_, I.\r\n381-389, and in Marriott, _Formulare Instrumentorum_ (London, 1802),\r\npp. 130-148. Since in civil-law procedure witnesses were not examined\r\norally in open court, but all testimony was obtained in the form of\r\nwritten depositions, it was advisable in prize proceedings, in order\r\nthat examinations might be thorough and searching, to employ standard\r\nsets of questions, ready-made. Anthony Stokes (1735-1799), from whose\r\nbook the present specimen is taken, was an English or Welsh lawyer,\r\npractised law in Antigua and St. Christopher 1763-1769, and was\r\nchief-justice of Georgia, 1769-1776, 1779-1782, then retired to\r\nEngland as a loyalist.

Libel of Richard Haddon. March 9, 1757._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This document, and all that follow relating to this case,\r\nnos. 184-196, are derived from the files of the vice-admiralty court\r\nwhich during the colonial period sat in New York. They are preserved\r\nin the offices of the United States district court in that city. In\r\nthe case of the colonial admiralty courts which sat in Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Charleston, only the record-books of those courts,\r\nfrom which several of our documents were obtained, have survived, and\r\nof the other courts apparently nothing; but from the New York\r\nadmiralty court we have, besides records, a copious mass of papers\r\nrelating to the cases, preserved by an exceptionally careful assistant\r\nregister. By the care of Hon. Charles M. Hough, U.S. circuit judge,\r\nthese papers have been arranged, mounted, and bound in model fashion.\r\nIn interpreting the papers here printed, the editor has been much\r\nassisted by an opportunity to read a manuscript of Judge Hough's\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\nThe case of the _Virgen del Rosario_, more exactly the cases of\r\nRichard Haddon _v._ 10 Doubloons, etc., of Ybanez _v._ L2409, and of\r\nthe King _v._ Thomas Miller and Sampson Simpson, give excellent\r\nillustrations of the chicanery with which prize cases could be\r\nconducted and of the manner in which through admiralty courts the ends\r\nof justice could be defeated. The materials are copious. The history\r\nof the capture is sufficiently set forth in docs. no. 187 and no. 188.\r\nThe legal history of the case may be summarized as follows. Sept. 20,\r\n1756, Nathaniel Marston and Jasper Farmar petition governor and\r\ncouncil for a privateer's commission for the _Peggy_ or _Charming\r\nPeggy_, whereof Richard Haddon was to be commander, Christopher Miller\r\nlieutenant; _Cal. N.Y. Hist. MSS._, II. 659. Sept. 29, 1756, the\r\ncommission is granted. Dec. 7, 1756, the _Peggy_ captures the schooner\r\n_La Virgen del Rosario y el Santo Christo de Buen Viage_, plunders\r\nher, and lets her go. (It will be remembered that Great Britain was\r\nnot at war with Spain at this time, but only with France.) Mar. 5,\r\n1757, the _Peggy_ arrives at New York, \"having taken as many Prizes\r\nduring her Cruize as she could well man\"; _Pennsylvania Gazette_, Mar.\r\n10. Mar. 9, Haddon libels the plunder (doc. no. 184). Mar. 31, the\r\nadmiralty judge decrees that it shall be his, provided no better\r\nclaimant arises within a year and a day, and provided he furnishes\r\nsureties to the register of the court to the value of L2409. 4s. 11d.;\r\nnotes of Sir William Burrell on this case in _Reports of Cases\r\ndetermined by the High Court of Admiralty and upon Appeal therefrom,\r\ntemp. Sir Thomas Saulsbury and Sir George Hay_, ed. R.G. Marsden\r\n(London, 1885), pp. 185-186. July 26, 1757, the sureties present their\r\naccount of sales (doc. no. 186). Feb. 17, 1758, and Mar. 10, on\r\npressure from London, where Captain Ybanez has made his complaint, the\r\nadvocate general in New York files a claim for money and goods, in the\r\nking's name, to restore them to the Spaniards. Apr. 5, the sureties\r\ndemur. Apr. 19, the judge dismisses the advocate general's claim.\r\nSept. 27, 1758, Ybanez files his own claim or libel (doc. no. 188),\r\nbut the judge rules Feb. 10, 1759, that his time had expired (Marsden,\r\n_loc. cit._). Dec. 19, 1760, the Lords Commissioners of Appeals in\r\nPrize Causes reverse the colonial court, and condemn the captor in\r\ncosts and damages (_ibid._, and doc. no. 195). July 4 and 26, 1761,\r\nthe New York judge declares that, while the Lords of Appeal had\r\napparently reversed his decree of Mar. 31, 1757, on Haddon's libel,\r\nthey had not reversed his decree of Feb. 10, 1759, on that of Ybanez,\r\nthe decree actually appealed from (court papers). But so the matter\r\nhad been dragged on until, Jan. 4, 1762, Great Britain declared war\r\nagainst Spain, and it may be considered certain that Ybanez never\r\nrecovered anything; perhaps he did not deserve to, for pretty clearly\r\nhe had been violating or evading the laws of his own country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, July 14, 1758, the advocate general, on account of\r\nirregularities on Haddon's part violating his commission as a\r\nprivateer, had sued his bondsmen (King _v._ Miller and Simpson). Their\r\ncounsel moved for a commission to take evidence in Havana, which was\r\ngranted by the court, Sept. 2, 1758; hence docs. nos. 189, 191-194.\r\nJune 27, 1761, on all the evidence now collected, the court decreed\r\nforfeiture of the bond. July 7, 1761, the sureties appealed (doc. no.\r\n196), but there is no record evidence that their appeal was ever\r\nperfected, or that they ever paid.

That he\r\nfirst knew the Schooner called the _Virgin of the Rosary and Santo\r\nChristo_ in the year 1756 when he bought her in Jamaica. That she\r\nbelonged to Port Trinity[5] on the Island of Cuba immediately before\r\nthe 6th and 7th Days of December 1756.

That he was on board said Schooner on the 6th and 7th days of\r\nDecember 1756 as Commander and Owner. That said Schooner was not then\r\nEquipped to use Force in any manner but only as a trading Vessel. That\r\nshe had on board three small Guns unloaded and Six Swivel Guns, three\r\nof which were Loaded with Ball in Case of Necessity to make Signals\r\nbut all in the Hold for Ballast, and fourteen Hangers,[6] which was\r\nall the Arms on board. That he this Deponent was sole Owner of said\r\nSchooner at that time. That when he this Deponent was met with by\r\nRichd.

That the Spanish Passengers were Residents at the Havana\r\nwith their Families and so were the Seamen Except one who is a\r\nResident at St. Agustin. That the motive of the Spanish passengers\r\ngoing in said Schooner was to trade at Jamaica. That said Schooner had\r\nno more Mariners on board than is Customary nor so many as is quite\r\nNecessary for such a Vessel. That there was no such person on board\r\nsaid Schooner as Francisco Raphel[11] at the time she was taken by\r\nRichd.

That said Licence was for said\r\nSchooner to go from Port Trinity to Port Mansanillo[12] which Licence\r\nand said Papers was taken from said Don Phelipe Ybanes by said Richd.\r\nHaddon by Force. That he this Deponent as soon as he came on board the\r\nPrivateer shewed Richd. Haddon his Licence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Manzanillo is on the south coast of Cuba, two hundred\r\nmiles east of Trinidad, and thus on the way to Jamaica! It should be\r\nmentioned that export of provisions from Cuba to Jamaica was forbidden\r\nby Spanish regulations.]\r\n\r\n4ly. That at the time of the Seizure of said Schooner, the Cargoe\r\nconsisted of the following particulars--Six Thousand Nine Hundred and\r\nSeventy five Spanish Heavy Dollars,[13] Six Hundred and Sixteen\r\nDollars in Dobloons, two Hundred and Eighty Dollars in Gold Trinkets,\r\na Bag[14] of Indigo [of] 125 lbs., the greatest part of the Schooners\r\nProvisions, the Spanish Colours, about 50 lbs.

That said Richd. Haddon when he met with the said Spanish\r\nSchooner fired a Ball at her notwithstanding she had her Spanish\r\nColours Flying and had brought to to speak with said Haddon and the\r\nReason that induced said Deponent not to make the most of his way from\r\nsaid Privateer was that he knew the two Crowns of England and Spain to\r\nbe in Friendship. That the Privateer Boat came on board said Spanish\r\nSchooner with a Lieut. Christop'r Miller[15] by Name and seven more\r\nSeamen. That he this Deponent shewed said Lieut. his Licence telling\r\nhim at the same time that they were Spaniards and the Vessel and\r\nCargoe Span'h property, From whence they came and whither Bound. That\r\nsaid Lieut. and People seemed very Civil and Regular till they\r\ndiscovered the Money which as soon as they had done, they Insisted on\r\nthe Spaniards having run away with it and gave that as a pretence for\r\nSeising it which they did and carryed the same away by Force with\r\nother particulars already mentioned by this Deponent. That said Richd.\r\nHaddon did order this Deponent and all the People (except two or\r\nthree) on board the Privateer and there treated them as Prisoners,\r\nsaid Haddon being on board. That he this Deponent told said Haddon\r\nfrom whence he came and where he was bound to and that he was a\r\nSubject of Spain and declared that Himself was Commander of said\r\nSchooner when she Sailed from the Havana and that he shewed said\r\nHaddon his Licence and other Papers. That said Haddon did not declare\r\nthat he would carry the said Schooner to the Havana, on the contrary\r\nthis Deponent and the People belonging to the Spanish Schooner were\r\nvery desirous of it and requested of him to carry them there. That\r\nsaid Rd. Haddon's Lieut. and People did by Force and Violence Seize\r\nsaid Money and Effects and carry them away against the Consent and\r\nSolisitation of this Deponent and people belonging to said Spanish\r\nSchooner. That said Span'h Schooner was at that time in good Order and\r\nwell Conditioned both as to her Hull, Sails and Rigging and fitt to\r\ncome to New York. That this Depont. desired of sd. Rd. Haddon that the\r\nMoney might be Counted but sd. Haddon Refused it. That when this\r\nDeponent and People were brought on board the Privateer they were all\r\nof them Searched and Money and Effects taken from the Several\r\nfollowing Persons. From Miguel Fuentes 1 pair Silver Buckles and 1\r\npair Gold Buttons, From Don Geronimo de la Cal 1 pair of silver\r\nBuckles and a Ring, From Pablo Antonio Corea 1 pr Silver Buckles, From\r\nCayetano Peres 1 pair Silver Buckles and four Dollars. All these were\r\ntaken from the People beside the Money and Effects brought from on\r\nboard the Spanish Schooner. That said Rd. Haddon never told them that\r\nhe would proceed to New York in order to Lybel the Money and Effects\r\naforesaid but on the Contrary Endeavoured to Conceal his Name and from\r\nwhence he came as much as possible from this Deponent and his people.\r\nThat there never was any Agreement between this Deponent and his\r\nPeople with Rd Haddon or anything like it relating to the Money and\r\nEffects aforesaid. That said Richd. Haddon's Lieut. Chrsr. Miller by\r\nName, with some of the Mariners belonging to said Privateer, did treat\r\nthis Deponent and Comp'y belonging to said Spanish Schooner with\r\nthreatning and abusive Language on Returning them on board said\r\nSpanish Vessel. That said Rd. Haddon did not offer to bring this\r\nDepont. and People to New York, for as was declared before He did not\r\nmention New York nor did this Deponent and People know he came from\r\nthence. That said Rd. Haddon did take from on board said Spanish\r\nSchooner and carry away with him in the said private Vessel of War,\r\ntwo Passengers by Names Henry Myerhoffer and Willm. Abbot both\r\nsubjects of Great Britn. That this Deponent did Request said Richd.\r\nHaddon to carry him to some Eng'h Port but was refused. That he this\r\nDeponent did Request from said Richd. Haddon a Receipt or Certificate\r\nAcknowledging that he the sd Rd. Haddon had taken from on board the\r\nsaid Span'h Schooner the Money and Effects aforesaid, which said\r\nDeponent Requested in order to shew as a proof of what had happened to\r\nhim. That the said Richd.

And when and not before\r\nthe said privateer had Hoisted sail to Leave Lucea aforesaid the said\r\nHenry Myerhoffer and William Abbot were set at Liberty, and the said\r\nPrivateer proceeded to sea. And the said Philip further Sheweth that\r\nHe the said Richard Haddon in the said Privateer Did afterwards Arrive\r\nat this port of New York And that the said Richard Haddon did\r\nafterwards on or about the ninth Day of March in the Year of our Lord\r\none Thousand Seven hundred and fifty six[6] by his Lybel filed in\r\nthis Court claim Part of the Money, Goods, and Effects which had been\r\ntaken from him the said Philip in Manner aforesaid, viz. Ten\r\nDoubloons, five Thousand seven hundred and sixty four Dollars, one\r\nHundred and five Pistreens and some small Silver, as also one\r\nBracelet, twenty gold Rings, some Silver Buckles, six swivel Guns,\r\nsome Shot, one Cask of Powder, some Cutlasses and one Bag of Indigo,\r\nas being the Property of the Subjects of the French King and prayed\r\nthat the same might by the Sentence of this Court be adjudged and\r\ncondemned as Lawfull Prize to him the said Richard Haddon and the\r\nOwners and Company of the said Privateer _Peggy_, as by the said Lybel\r\nfiled in this Court, Reference being hereunto had, may more fully\r\nappear; That the said Philip not having any Pilot or Person on Board\r\nhis said Vessel who was acquainted with the Navigation on this Coast\r\nwas all together deprived of the Means and Opportunity of making his\r\nClaim and Defence to the said Lybel; That immediately after the said\r\nSeizure he returned with said Spanish Schooner to the Havannah, and\r\ncomplained there, of the said abuse that he had received from the sd.\r\nRichard Haddon and his Officers and Company. That the Governour of the\r\nHavannah[7] hearing thereof highly resented the same (and as the said\r\nPhilip has been informed and hopes to prove) wrote to his Excellency\r\nSr. Charles Hardy, then Governour of this Province,[8] upon the Matter\r\nof his said Complaint, demanding Redress, And that at that Time there\r\nbeing a British Man of War lying in that Port the Said Philip also\r\nmade the like Complaint to the Commander of the said Ship who advised\r\nthe said Philip immediately to repair with his Schooner to Jamaica and\r\nmake his Case known to the Government there and Particularly to\r\nAdmiral Townshend who was upon that Station, That upon proper\r\nRepresentations being made, Justice might be obtained and Reparation\r\nprocured to the said Philip by Means and assistance of the British\r\nGovernment; That accordingly the said Philip proceeded to Jamaica and\r\narrived there on or about the Beginning of March one Thousand seven\r\nhundred and fifty seven and applied to Admiral Townsend and made his\r\nAffidavit of the Treatment and Usage that he had received from the\r\nsaid Richard Haddon and the said Officers and Crew of the said\r\nPrivateer _Peggy_ before a proper Officer there, and also finding the\r\nsaid Henry Myerhoffer in that Island he procured his Affidavit to be\r\ntaken of the like matter, both which affidavits properly certified\r\nunder the Seal of the said Island are filed with the Register of this\r\nCourt and to which the said Philip for greater Certainty doth refer;\r\nThat his Majesty the King of Great Britain, being informed of the\r\nPremises by Affidavits concerning the same, transmitted by Admiral\r\nTownsend, did by a Letter from the Right Honourable the Earl of\r\nHoldernesse his Secretary of State to the Governour of this Province,\r\nDated at Whitehall the twentieth Day of May one Thousand seven hundred\r\nand fifty seven,[9] express the deepest resentment of the said Injury\r\ndone to the said Philip by the said Richard Haddon and the officers\r\nand Crew belonging to the said private Vessel of War, as being\r\ncontrary to all Humanity and Good Faith and the General Instructions\r\nGiven to Privateers, And did require and demand that Justice might be\r\ndone within this his Government to the Subjects of his Catholick\r\nMajesty relating to the Premises, as by the said Letter filed in the\r\nMinutes of his Majesty's Council for this Province of New York[10] and\r\nan attested Copy thereof filed with the Register of this Court, to\r\nwhich the said Philip doth refer, may more fully and at large appear.\r\nAnd the said Philip further sheweth That during these Transactions in\r\nthe West Indies and in Great Britain he the said Richard Haddon\r\nprosecuted his said Lybel in this Court and to give the better Colour\r\nto his Pretensions that the Money, Goods and Effects before mentioned\r\nwere French Property did on the thirty first of March one Thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty seven procure Some Person calling himself\r\nFrancisco Raphe to be examined before the Register of this Court[11]\r\non the Part of him the said Richard Haddon against the Money, Goods\r\nand Effects mentioned in his said Lybel, wherein the said Francisco\r\nRaphe deposes among other Things that he is a Native of Sierra in\r\nGreece and Subject of the Grand Turk, by Occupation a Marriner, That\r\ntwo Days after the Vessel, he was on Board of, sailed out of Cuba they\r\nwere taken by Captain Haddon which was about December then last, That\r\nhe did not know the Vessel's Name of which he was on Board for She had\r\nno regular Commander nor Dispatches or Papers of any Kind from any\r\nPort or Place whatsoever, and he believes that had such Vessel been\r\ntaken by any vessel of any Nation She would have been a lawfull Prize\r\nAnd had She been taken by a Spanish Guarda Costa, the whole Ship's\r\nCrew would have been hanged as Pirates, That there were on Board, of\r\nall Nations allmost, as Genoesse, French and others, in Number twenty\r\ntwo, and that one of the Chiefs in particular was a French man,\r\nSubject of the French King, That he absolutely, from all the Knowledge\r\nhe can form, thinks her to be a just and lawfull Prize; And he the\r\nsaid Philip further sheweth that he is advised that the said\r\nDeposition is of a very extraordinary Nature, and made by one who\r\nsupposed himself to have been a Pyrate; That by Reason of its great\r\nIncertainty it can have no legal Application either to him the said\r\nPhilip or his Schooner; that the Vessel on which the said Francisco\r\nRaphe was on Board was a Ship of the Crew Whereof he was one; That the\r\nsaid Schooner of the said Philip had a regular Commander and proper\r\nDispatches and Papers from Trindada a Spanish Port; That not one\r\nFrench Man or Genoe was on Board the said Schooner nor any one\r\nMarriner or passenger Except the said Henry Myerhoffer and William\r\nAbbot that was not a Subject of Spain; And the said Philip further\r\nsheweth That he is an entire Stranger to the said Francisco Raphe,\r\nThat he knows no Person of that Name, and is very certain that no such\r\nperson was either a Seamen or Passenger on Board the said Schooner in\r\nthe Voyage before mentioned, and the said Philip is informed that no\r\nWitness whatsoever was produced in this Court to Prove the Money,\r\nGoods and Effects mentioned in the said Lybel of the said Richd.\r\nHaddon to be French Property but the said Francisco Raphe, and that by\r\nthe Minutes of this Court it will appear that on the very Day the said\r\nExamination was taken Publication was ordered to pass and the Cause to\r\nbe immediately heard, and thereupon the Proctor for the said Richard\r\nHaddon opened the Lybel and Proceedings, and the Deposition of the\r\nsaid Francisco Raphe being read this Court having considered of the\r\nsame did adjudge, Sentence and decree the said Money, Goods and\r\nEffects in the said Lybel mentioned as lawfull Prize for the use of\r\nthe Captors, pursuant to the Statute in that Case made and _provided_\r\nthat no just and rightful Claim be made for the same by any Other\r\nPerson or Persons within a year and a Day, and ordered that the\r\nLybellant stipulate with Security to the Register of this Court in the\r\nAmount of the said Gold, Silver and other Things to bring the said\r\nAmount into this Court when this Court should order the same within a\r\nyear and a Day aforesaid, To which Minute of this Court the said\r\nPhilip doth refer, And the sd. Philip further sheweth That at a Court\r\nof Vice Admiralty held at the City of New York on the twenty-sixth Day\r\nof July then next following, pursuant to the order of this Court of\r\nthe thirty first Day of March then last past, the Accounts of Sales of\r\nthe said Gold, Silver and other Things lybelled as aforesaid were\r\nbrought into this Court and filed,[12] And that thereupon Jasper\r\nFarmer and Thomas Miller of the City of New York, Merchants, appeared\r\nin this Court and freely and voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction\r\nthereof And severally stipulated to the Register of this Court in the\r\nSum of Two Thousand four Hundred and nine Pounds, four Shillings and\r\neleven Pence three Farthings, said to be the Amount of the said Gold,\r\nSilver etc. on Condition to bring the said Money into this Court when\r\nthis Court should order the same at any Time within a year and a Day\r\nfrom the said thirty first Day of March then last past, as by the said\r\nOrders and Proceedings of this Court to which the said Philip doth\r\nrefer, Relation being thereunto had, may appear. And the said Philip\r\nfurther sheweth that by the said Letter of the Right Honourable the\r\nEarl of Holdernesse before mentioned and above referred to, his\r\nMajesty The King of Great Britain did Command Prosecutions to be\r\nimmediately commenced for the Recovery of what should appear to be so\r\nplundered from the said Philip and others the Subjects of the King of\r\nSpain or the full Value thereof, with all Costs and Damages occasioned\r\nby the premises; That his said Majesty's Advocate General for this\r\nProvince of New York, in obedience to his Majesty's Pleasure so\r\nsignified and the express Order and Direction of his Honour the\r\nLieutenant Governour of this Province and Commander in Chief then\r\nbeing (having received Information of the said Orders and Proceedings\r\nof this Court) to prevent any Prejudice to the Subjects of the said\r\nKing of Spain, in consequence of the same did on the seventeenth Day\r\nof February last past, in the Name and Behalf of his said Majesty the\r\nKing of Great Britain, for the Use and Benefit of the said Philip and\r\nother Subjects of the King of Spain, enter and file his Claim to the\r\nMoney and Goods first above mentioned, which had been with Force and\r\nViolence taken from him the sd. Philip, declaring it to be intended\r\ntherein to include all the Particulars that had been before libelled\r\nby the said Richard Haddon and other Goods that had not been so\r\nlybelled, but had been taken and seized by the said Richard Haddon in\r\nManner as aforesaid, together with the Interest, Damages and Costs\r\nwhich had accrued by Reason of the Premises; That afterwards the said\r\nAdvocate General on the tenth of March last in Obedience to the Orders\r\naforesaid did file his Claim more at large In this Court and among\r\nother Things therein contained prayed that this Court would order and\r\ndecree that the said Monies, Goods and Chattels in the said Lybel of\r\nthe said Richard Haddon mentioned might by the Order of this Court be\r\nbrought into this Court according to the Stipulation aforesaid, as by\r\nthe said Claim filed with the Register of this Court, to which the\r\nsaid Philip doth refer, may more fully and at large appear.\r\nWhereupon, on the said tenth Day of March, it was ordered by this\r\nCourt that the Securities of the said Richard Haddon do bring into\r\nthis Court the said Sum of two Thousand four Hundred and nine Pounds,\r\nfour Shillings and Eleven Pence three Farthings, being the Amount of\r\ntheir Stipulations aforesaid, on or before that day Week or Shew Cause\r\nto the contrary; That on the seventeenth Day of March last the said\r\nJasper Farmer and Thomas Miller appeared in this Court by their\r\nProctor But did not bring into this Court the said Sum last mentioned\r\nand had Time till the fifth Day of April following to shew Cause why\r\nthey had not done it, on which Day they filed their Demurrer to the\r\nsaid Claim of the said Advocate General, alledging for Cause of\r\nDemurrer that it appeared by the said Claim that the Scope and End\r\nthereof was to relieve the said Philip y: Banes, a Spaniard, claiming\r\nthe Money and Effects formerly Lybelled in this Court by Richard\r\nHaddon in Behalf of himself and the Owners and Company of the Schooner\r\n_Peggy_, as French Property, against the Sentence and Decree of this\r\nCourt, to all which several Matters and other Things in the said Claim\r\ncontained the said Defendants did demur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cabanas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Caleb Davis had lived at St. Augustine as a trader for\r\nseveral years prior to 1738, had made himself wealthy when, in 1739,\r\nhe proposed to settle in Savannah, and was a shrewd, cunning fellow,\r\nso says Secretary William Stephens in his journal; _Col.

To the third Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he knew a\r\nperson called Don Philip, which this deponent supposes to be the same\r\nperson Philip Vanes, otherwise called Philip De Francois, otherwise\r\ncalled Philip Y Banes, mentioned in the third Interrogatory, that he\r\nfirst saw him the 7th of December 1756, In the Latitude of 21 and 33\r\nm.

To the fourth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he saw a\r\ncertain Schooner pretended to be a spanish Schooner, But did not know\r\nher name, and first became acquainted with her the 7th of December\r\n1756, In the Latitude of 21 and 23 N: and Longitude 81 and 30, this\r\ndeponent was on board the privateer _peggy_ when the said Schooner\r\nwas taken, that he was Capn. Clerk,[3] this deponent is not very\r\npositive but believes there was about fourteen men on board the said\r\nschooner at the time she was taken, that the said schooner had four\r\ncarriage [and] six swivel Guns at the time she was brought too, as\r\nthis deponent afterwards heard, and that she had no regular papers or\r\nClearances from any publick authority, as this deponent saw or heard\r\nat that time or since. This depont. also knows and remembers that\r\nparticular pains was taken by Capn. Haddon and all the officers\r\nbelonging to the said privateer to discover whether there were any\r\nregular ships papers or Clearances on board the said schooner at the\r\ntime of her being taken, and in particular the Capn. when he sent\r\nChristopher Miller on board, his first Lieutt., desired him to send\r\nall the papers of the schooner on board the privt.; that after the sd.\r\nfirst Liet. got on board he made a search and told the said Capn.\r\nHaddon from the said schooner that he could find no regular papers on\r\nboard her, whereupon the Capn. told him bring all the papers he could\r\nfind and the Capn. of the sd. Schooner, upon which the Liet. made\r\nanswer he could not tell which was the Capn.; upon that the Capn. told\r\nhim to bring two or three of the Likeliest of the men, that he did so\r\nand these men belonging to the said schooner came on board, one of\r\nwhich, which the deponent took to be Don Philip, being asked for the\r\npapers delivered a pocket book to the Capn. which the Capn opened upon\r\nthe Quarter deck and took out the papers; that this deponent was there\r\nand saw nothing but a few Letters, sealed up and directed to Different\r\npersons in Kingston; then sd. Capn. Haddon told the said Philip that\r\nhe certainly must have more papers; upon that sd Philip shrugged up\r\nhis shoulders and was Silent, and after that Capn Haddon called to the\r\nfirst Liet., wo [who] was still on board the said Schooner, to make a\r\nfurther Search, and this deponent never heard of any papers at all\r\nbeing found that were satisfactory. the said Philip appd.[4] to be the\r\nCapn. or principal officer of the said schooner. this deponent\r\nfurther Says that he heard Capn. Haddon say, upon the peoples asking\r\nwhat he Intended to do with them, that he would carry them to the\r\nHavannah, upon which as this deponent understood by the Interpretation\r\nof one Francis De Spania, a Spaniard belonging to the privateer\r\n_peggy_, and from the Declarations of Capn Haddon, they begged and\r\nIntreated he would not, for that if he did they would either be hanged\r\nor made slaves, and that they said they did not value the money, and\r\ntheir lives would be of Little Service to Capn. Haddon, and the said\r\nCapn. told this deponent the reason he did not send her into any port\r\nfor condemnation was partly out of humanity to the people and partly\r\nin regard to the Interest of his owners. This deponent does not know\r\ncertainly but has been Informed that the said Schooner was not\r\nproperly equipped or fitt to come upon this Coast in the months of\r\nDecember or January.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Captain's clerk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Appeared.]\r\n\r\n5th. To the fifth Interrogatory this deponent saith that to the best\r\nof his Knowledge the said Schooner had on board of her at the time she\r\nwas brought to by the said privateer _peggy_ about fourteen men,\r\ncomposed of a Mixture of Nations, that the following Quantitys of\r\nMoney was taken out of the said and brought on board of the _peggy_\r\nand Sorted on the deck and there counted, viz. 5764 Dollar, 10\r\nDoubbloons, 105 pistereen, 1 Two Shilling, 1 shilling, five bitts, two\r\npair of Silver Knee buckles and one Box containing Sundry Trinkets of\r\nGold, to witt, one Bracelet, twenty Gold rings and one pair of Gold\r\nSleeve buttons; it was brought on board in a publick manner and it was\r\nsorted and counted in this deponents presence and this deponent\r\nunderstood that the said money and other things were owned among the\r\ndifferent persons on board.\r\n\r\n6th. To the Sixth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he heard that\r\nthe persons on board the said Schooner delivered up or gave the said\r\nbox or Trinkets to Capn Haddon on condition that he would not Carry\r\nthe said Schooner with the Crew thereof to the Havannah and further\r\nsaith not to this Interrogatory.\r\n\r\n7th. To the Seventh Interrogatory this deponent saith that he knows\r\nthat Capn. Haddon acquainted the persons on board the said Schooner\r\nwith the name of his vessel, his own name, the port she belonged to,\r\nand that he should carry the things he had from on board the said\r\nschooner to the port of New York for condemnation.\r\n\r\n8th. To the eighth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he remembers\r\nThat another Schooner was brought to by the _peggy_ some short time\r\nbefore the schooner was brought to out of which Capn. Haddon had the\r\nmoney belonging to the Spanish Nation, and richly Laden and they were\r\nTreated extreamly Civil by Capn. Haddon; this depont. Could not\r\nobserve from any of his conduct that he was desirous to rob or pilfer\r\nthem, but on their producing regular paper and clearances discharged\r\nthem, and this deponent knows of his supplying a Spanish Sloop with\r\nprovisions on the Twelfth of Jan'y 1757.\r\n\r\n9th. To the Ninth Interrogatory this depont. saith that he knows of\r\nnothing further that will tend to the advantage of the defendt. in\r\nthis Cause except That Capn. Haddon found a french Letter on board of\r\na prize which he took coming from the Mississippi, from a french\r\nofficer in Luisiania to a person of distinction in old france, by\r\nwhich he understood that the french were Incroaching upon the Spanish\r\nTerritories and had still designs so to do, upon which Capn. Haddon\r\nInclosed the said french Letter in a Letter Directed to the Governour\r\nof the Havannah, which said Letter this depont. wrote by direction of\r\nthe Capn.,[5] and that the said Capn. always Treated prisoners and\r\nothers with humanity and Civilly and always acted with much care.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See also doc. no. 184, note 3.]\r\n\r\n10th. To the Tenth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he shall not\r\ngain or loose by the event of the suit any other wise than by reason\r\nof the near relationship he stands in to Capn.

November 22, 1759._\r\n\r\nIn the Havana on the 22 Novemb'r 1759, Before His Honour Don Martin de\r\nUlloa, of the Order of St. James, one of his Maj'ys Council, Lieut.\r\nGov'r and Auditor of this City and Jurisdiction, Commissioned by his\r\nMajesty in this Cause, Appeared Elizabeth Berrow, a Widow and\r\nInhabit't of this said City, and Swaring by the Sign of the Cross\r\naccording to Right and Form, promised to declare the Truth, and being\r\nEnquired relating to the Tenor of the Articles Inserted in the\r\nInterrogatory and Comprehended in the foregoing Copy Declared as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n1. To the first she said that she knew Don Phelipe Ybanes in the year\r\n56 by reason of his having been several times at her House, where\r\nCaleb David an English Man Lodged, who he went to see; That she knew\r\nsaid Ybanes to be a Spaniard by having heard it so Reported and that\r\nhe Married in this City; that he went to Sea in a Shooner of which he\r\nwas entire Owner, as said Caleb David and Ybanes himself Reported.\r\n\r\n2. To the second she said that she understood from said Ybanes that\r\nthe Schooner which he called his own was Named _Our Lady of the\r\nRosary_ though she never saw said Schooner in this Port. That the said\r\nYbanes before he went out in her came to see Caleb David and told him\r\nin the presence of this Deponent that he had been thinking to make a\r\nVoyage to Jamaica and that if he had any Commands there he would\r\nExecute them, telling him that he carried to the Amount of Eight\r\nThousand Dollars in Money and Gold and Silver Trinkets. Upon which\r\nsaid Caleb David gave him Several Letters of Recommendation for\r\nJamaica and desired him to carry two Englishmen that came with him in\r\nthe Long Boat from Campeche to this Port where the Embarkation in\r\nwhich they arrived had been Confiscated.\r\n\r\n3. To the third she said that she Refers to what she Answered in the\r\nforegoing and that it does not appear to her that said Schooner\r\ncarried any other Cargoe beside the Money and Trinkets as aforesaid,\r\nnor does she know if she went to Sea with Correspondent papers and\r\nPassports or not, But when Don Phelipe Ybanes Returned to this City\r\nand Related to Caleb David how the English Privateers had taken away\r\nwhat he Carried and that he was minded to go to Jamaica and Reclaim\r\nhis Effects, said Caleb David offered him New Letters of\r\nRecommendation and a Certificate that said Ybanes was not risen up as\r\nthe English had been pleased to Suppose but was only a Merchant.\r\n\r\n4. To the fourth she said that she knew Caleb David very well, that he\r\nLodged three Months and odd Days at her House, by means of which she\r\ncame to know that his coming to this City was to Reclaim some prises\r\ntaken from the English Nation after the Cessation of Hostilities, to\r\nwhich End he brought Powers from the Concerned and Dispatches from the\r\nCourt of Gt. Britain which he shewed to this Deponent.\r\n\r\n5. To the fifth she said that she knew the two individuals mentioned,\r\nthe one of which was a German and the other an Englishman, but both\r\nSubjects of the King of G'Brit'n and living in Georgia, who came to\r\nthis City with Caleb David in the aforesaid Long Boat and are the same\r\nPersons that he desired Don Phelipe Ybanes to take with him to\r\nJamaica, and she was informed by said Caleb's Wife that in Effect they\r\ndid go with him, but does not know if they went away by Day or by\r\nNight, as they did not Lodge in the Deponents House but on board the\r\nLong Boat and only came there once a Day to carry provision, which was\r\nConsidered to be for Ybanes's Schooner, which he declared was so when\r\nhe Returned to this City and said that the English Privateer Carried\r\nthem on board as being Subjects of G't Britain.\r\n\r\n6. To the Sixth she said that she only knows Antonio Correa, whose\r\nEmploy is that of a Mariner, but is Ignorant what Voyage he made in\r\nthe year and at the time mentioned or in what Vessel.\r\n\r\n7. To this she said that she knows nothing of what is Contained in\r\nthis Enquiry.\r\n\r\n8. To the Eighth she said that she neither Expects nor has any\r\nInterest from the Decission of this Cause and that what she has\r\nDeclared is the Truth of which she has given Oath, being Dated. That\r\nshe is thirty six years of Age. to which she Signs her Name and His\r\nHonour has placed his Rubric.\r\n\r\nISABEL DE VERROA.\r\n\r\nBefore me\r\n\r\nJUANFERN'O DEL VALLE.\r\n  Not'y Pub.\r\n\r\n\r\n_195.

News of Privateers. May 19, 1757._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the _Boston News-Letter_ of May 19, 1757.]\r\n\r\nBy a Master of a Vessel lately arrived from Hispaniola, we are\r\ninform'd, that on the 13th of April there lay at Port of Prince[2] a\r\nBrig of about 120 Tons, mounting 14 Carriage Guns, and 200 Men, also a\r\nSloop about 70 Tons, 8 Carriage Guns and 100 Men, both intended in\r\nConsort (as it was there said) for the Coast of New-York and\r\nthereabouts. The Brig is Rhode-Island built, black sides, with a white\r\nBottom, the Sloop is painted very gay, as with red, yellow, black and\r\ngreen. He heard likewise that at another Port in the said Island,\r\nthere was fitting out a Snow (which had been lately a Packet taken\r\nfrom the English) to mount 16 Carriage Guns, and to be commanded by\r\none Palanqui (a very noted Commander) to come on the same Coast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Port au Prince, on the west coast, the present capital of\r\nHaiti.]\r\n\r\nWe hear from Bristol, in Rhode-Island Government, that Capt.\r\nMark-Anthony De Wolfe[3] in a Privateer Sloop of 50 Tuns, with 40\r\nHands and 6 Guns, belonging to Warren, sail'd from thence the 24th of\r\nApril, and put into Newport, from whence she sail'd three Days after;\r\nand on the 4th of this Instant May, to the Northward of Bermudas, took\r\na French Snow of 150 Tons, with 18 Men, who made but little\r\nResistance, having but 2 Guns, and no one killed or wounded on either\r\nside: The Privateer return'd with her Prize to Bristol the 15th,\r\nhaving finished this Cruize in 3 Weeks to an Hour. The Cargo of the\r\nSnow consists of 200 Hogsheads of Sugar, a Quantity of Coffee, Indigo,\r\nElephants-Teeth, Logwood, etc. and was bound from St. Domingo for\r\nOld-France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: He was brother-in-law of Captain Simeon Potter, and\r\nsailed with him, as clerk, on the _Prince Charles of Lorraine_ (see\r\ndocs. nos. 176, 177) in 1745. His son, James De Wolf, United States\r\nsenator 1821-1825, was one of the most successful of owners of\r\nprivateers; one of his vessels, the _Yankee_, captured or destroyed\r\nfive million dollars' worth of British property during the war of\r\n1812. Munro, _Tales of an Old Sea Port_, pp. 214-223.]\r\n\r\nYesterday the Privateer Ship _Hertford_, commanded by Capt. Thomas\r\nLewis, lately fitted out from this Place, brought into our Harbour a\r\nvaluable French Prize, a Ship of about 240 Tuns, which he took about\r\nthree Weeks ago, to the Southward of Bermudas in Lat. 29: She was\r\nbound from Porto Prince in Hispaniola to old France; her Cargo is said\r\nto consist of 400 Hogsheads of Sugar, and a considerable Quantity of\r\nIndigo, Cotton-Wool, Hides, etc. valued at about 9000L Sterling. She\r\nsail'd out with 4 other Vessels bound also to France, and had parted\r\nfrom her a Day or Two before she was taken: One of which is the Prize\r\ncarried into Bristol as beforementioned; and another of them is said\r\nto be the trading Sloop that was seized at Rhode-Island last Week. Two\r\nother Vessels, they say, sail'd the Day before them for Cape-Breton.\r\n\r\nSeveral French Letters found on board this Prize confirm the Arrival\r\nof the Squadron mentioned in our last, commanded by Monsieur\r\nBeaufremont;[4] and that he had sent out two Frigates to clear the\r\nCoast of our Privateers; but that the English Squadron approaching,\r\nthey ran into Porto Paix,[5] and informed the French Admiral thereof;\r\nwho thereupon put to Sea, and a great Number of Cannon were heard for\r\nseveral Hours; so that we may expect to hear of some smart Engagement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The Chevalier de Bauffremont, prince de Listenois, _chef\r\nd'escadre_ in the French navy and later vice-admiral, had sailed from\r\nBrest at the end of January, with a squadron of six vessels, for St.\r\nDomingo, capturing the _Greenwich_, 50, on his way.

April 8, 1757._[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: London, Public Record Office, Admiralty, 1:3882.]\r\n\r\nNEW YORK 8 April 1757.\r\n\r\n_Sir_,\r\n\r\nOn the 6th Instant, a French Snow[2] laden with Sugar[3] and Indigo,\r\nto a very considerable Value, was brought into this Port, by two\r\nEnglish Merchant men, who captivated her on the High Seas in March\r\nlast, tho they had neither Letters of Marque nor other Commission.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Le Bon Rencontre._ The case was a curious one (notes of\r\nJudge Hough, from the papers relating to it in the files of the New\r\nYork vice-admiralty court). On March 22, 1757, this French snow of 160\r\ntons, while on a trading voyage from Port Louis in Guadeloupe to\r\nBordeaux, was captured off Bermuda by the English ship _Maxwell_,\r\nEtherington master, and the New York sloop _St. Stephen_, Thomas, who\r\nsent her with an English crew to New York; but neither of them had any\r\nletters of marque, or commission authorizing them to take prizes. The\r\nsnow was brought to anchor inside Sandy Hook. Early in the morning of\r\nApril 6, John Crew, captain of the New York privateer _Fox_, came\r\naboard from a small boat with a few men, and took possession. Later,\r\nthe snow was taken over by the _Sutherland_ man-of-war. Thus, the _Bon\r\nRencontre_ was without doubt a captured enemy vessel, but the captors\r\nhad not been authorized privateers, and the authorized privateer and\r\nthe king's ship had not made the capture. Under these circumstances\r\nthe admiralty judge, Lewis Morris, ordered the marshal to take custody\r\nof the snow, and appointed Benjamin Nicoll and William Smith, jr., the\r\nwriter of this letter (see doc. no. 188, note 13), to be advocates for\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty, whose interests seemed to him to be\r\ninvolved. Thus there were four parties claiming--the original captors,\r\nCrew, the King, and the Admiralty. April 7 the snow was libelled on\r\nbehalf of the Admiralty. Later, Etherington withdrew and Crew's claim\r\nwas ruled out, but as between the King and the Admiralty Judge Lewis\r\nMorris gave no decision before his death in 1762. His successor, Judge\r\nRichard Morris, gave judgment Aug. 10, 1764, but it has not been\r\npreserved.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 200 hogsheads, says the _New York Gazette_ of Apr. 11;\r\nthe _Gazette_ of June 27, by the way, enumerates 23 privateers then in\r\nNew York harbor.]\r\n\r\nAfter her Arrival in Port, she was seized first by a Privateer, and\r\nthen by the _Southerland_ Man of War, who both claim her as their\r\nProperty respectively.\r\n\r\nColonel Morris, the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty, apprehending that the\r\nLords of the Admiralty might be interested, issued a Warrant, by which\r\nthe Snow was taken into the Custody of the Marshal of that Court; and\r\nas their Lordships have as yet appointed neither Proctor nor Advocate\r\nin this, and the Colonies of Connecticut and New Jersey, his Honour\r\nthe Commissary was pleased on this Occasion to assign Council (as you\r\nwill perceive by the inclosed) to examine into the Affair, and\r\nprosecute on their Lordships Behalf.\r\n\r\nWe have accordingly interposed a Libel for that Purpose, and let me\r\nbeg the Favour of you, to wait upon their Lordships, for an authentic\r\nCopy of their Patent, and such Information, as may be thought proper\r\nto be transmitted.\r\n\r\nWhether their Lordships, in Case of a Sentence in their Favour, will\r\nbe pleased to consider the Captors, or chuse rather to reserve the\r\nPrize to themselves, I conceive it will be necessary, that a proper\r\nPower be sent over; of which you will be so good as to put their\r\nLordships in Mind; and whatever Directions and Papers are given into\r\nyour Hands, please to forward them with the utmost Dispatch to,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient\r\n  humble Servant\r\n\r\nWM.

He dying\r\nMarch 5, 1759, receipt of this letter is acknowledged by his executor,\r\nJoseph Sherwood, May 11; letter in Miss Kimball's _Correspondence of\r\nthe Colonial Governors of Rhode Island_, II. 289. Sherwood, appointed\r\nagent as Partridge's successor, pursued the general assembly's\r\nrequest, but apparently without success, the Lords of the Admiralty\r\nthinking it unnecessary to appoint a register and marshal in Rhode\r\nIsland, when there were already such officers in Massachusetts;\r\n_ibid._, II. 289, 293, 298, 304, 306.]\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND January 15, 1759.\r\n\r\n_Sir_,\r\n\r\nYou may remember that near a Year ago I wrote you by Order of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to endeavor to procure a Judge of the Court of Vice\r\nAdmiralty to be appointed within and for this Colony.[2] And as you\r\nvery soon finished that Affair successfully, a Judge being appointed\r\nand commissioned, so he hath been accordingly sworn into his Office.\r\nNotwithstanding this being so far done, yet there appears to be a\r\nDeficiency of the Officers of that Court, as no Register or Marshal\r\nhave been appointed. It is true there hath commonly been a Deputy\r\nRegister in this Colony appointed by a Principal living in Boston at a\r\ngreat Distance from the Colony, and within another Jurisdiction, which\r\nseems incompatible, and it is solely at his Option, whether he will\r\nappoint a Deputy to attend in this Colony or not, the Inconvenience of\r\nwhich is obvious at the first View: And it doth not appear that any\r\nCommission hath been given for a Marshal of the Court of Vice\r\nAdmiralty in this Colony since one Mr. Gibbs was appointed to that\r\nOffice who hath been dead many years.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By vote of the assembly, _R.I. Col.

The note of\r\nMarch 10, 1762, and the list of commissions, were enclosures in the\r\nnote of Aug. 26, 1772. The writer, Samuel Seddon, was solicitor to the\r\nAdmiralty. John Clevland, to whom the earlier letter was addressed,\r\nwas secretary to that body from 1751 to 1763; Philip Stephens, from\r\n1763 to 1795. For these commissions to try pirates, see doc. no. 51,\r\nnote 2, and doc. no. 106, note 1. The death of George II. and the\r\naccession of George III., 1760, made necessary the issue of new\r\ncommissions.
