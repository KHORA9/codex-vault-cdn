They begin when he was 38\r\nyears of age; and at first they are not very numerous. There are only\r\ntwo of that year (68 B.C.), six of the following year, one of the year\r\n66, when he held the praetorship, and two of 65. Then there is a gap in\r\nhis correspondence. No letters at all survive from the period of his\r\nconsulship and the Catilinarian conspiracy; and the letters to Atticus\r\ndo not begin again until two years after that event. Thereafter they are\r\nsufficiently frequent to justify Cornelius Nepos’ criticism, that\r\nreading them, one has little need of an elaborate history of the period.\r\nThere are full—almost too full—details, considering the frequent\r\ncomplaints and repetitions, during the year of his banishment (58–57\r\nB.C.), and the correspondence continues unbroken to the year 54. Then\r\nafter a lapse of two years or more, which Atticus presumably spent in\r\nRome, it begins again in 51, when Cicero was sent to Cilicia as\r\npro-consul, much against his will; and the volume ends with a hint of\r\nthe trouble that was brewing between Caesar and Pompey, as Cicero was\r\nreturning to Rome towards the end of the next year.\r\n\r\nThe letters have been translated in the traditionary order in which they\r\nare usually printed. That order, however, is not strictly chronological;\r\nand, for the convenience of those who would read them in their\r\nhistorical order, a table arranging them so far as possible in order of\r\ndate has been drawn up at the end of the volume.\r\n\r\nFor the basis of the text the Teubner edition has been used; but it has\r\nbeen revised by comparison with more recent works and papers on the\r\nsubject. Textual notes have only been given in a few cases where the\r\nreading is especially corrupt or uncertain; and other notes too have\r\nbeen confined to cases where they seemed absolutely indispensable. For\r\nsuch notes and in the translation itself, I must acknowledge my\r\nindebtedness to predecessors, especially to Tyrrell’s indispensable\r\nedition and Shuckburgh’s excellent translation.\r\n\r\nThere remain two small points to which I may perhaps call attention here\r\nin case they should puzzle the general reader. The first is that, when\r\nhe finds the dates in this volume disagreeing with the rules and tables\r\ngenerally given in Latin grammars and taught in schools, he must please\r\nto remember that those rules apply only to the Julian Calendar, which\r\nwas introduced in 45 B.C., and that these letters were written before\r\nthat date. Before the alterations introduced by Caesar, March, May, July\r\nand October had 31 days each, February 28, and the other months 29.\r\nCompared with the Julian Calendar this shows a difference of two days in\r\nall dates which fall between the Ides and the end of the months January,\r\nAugust and December, and of one day in similar dates in April, June,\r\nSeptember and November.\r\n\r\nThe second point, which requires explanation, is the presence of some\r\nnumerals in the margin of the text of letters 16 to 19 of Book IV. As\r\nMommsen pointed out, the archetype from which the existent MSS. were\r\ncopied must have had some of the leaves containing these letters\r\ntransposed. These were copied in our MSS. in the wrong order, and were\r\nso printed in earlier editions. In the text Mommsen’s order, with some\r\nrecent modifications introduced by Holzapfel, has been adopted; and the\r\nfigures in the margin denote the place of the transposed passages in the\r\nolder editions, the Roman figures denoting the letter from which each\r\nparticular passage has been shifted and the Arabic numerals the section\r\nof that letter.\r\n\r\nThe following signs have been used in the apparatus criticus:—\r\n\r\n  _M_ = the _Codex Mediceus_ 49, 18, written in the year 1389 A.D., and\r\n    now preserved in the Laurentian Library at Florence. _M_^1 denotes\r\n    the reading of the first hand, and _M_^2 that of a reviser.\r\n\r\n  Δ = the reading of _M_ when supported by that of the _Codex Urbinas_\r\n    322, a MS. of the 15th century, preserved in the Vatican Library.\r\n\r\n  _E_ = _Codex Ambrosianus_ E, 14, a MS. probably of the 14th century,\r\n    in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.\r\n\r\n  _N_ = the _Codex ex abbatia Florentina_ n. 49 in the Laurentian\r\n    Library, written in the 14th or 15th century.\r\n\r\n  _P_ = No. 8536 of the Latin MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale at\r\n    Paris, a MS. of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n  _R_ = No. 8538 of the same collection, written in the year 1419. These\r\n    four MSS. _E_, _N_, _P_, _R_, with some others form a separate\r\n    class; and\r\n\r\n  Σ = the reading of all the MSS. of this class, or of a preponderant\r\n    number of them.\r\n\r\n  _C_ = the marginal readings in Cratander’s edition of 1528, drawn from\r\n    a MS. which is now lost.\r\n\r\n  _Z_ = the readings of the lost _Codex Tornaesianus_, _Z_^b denoting\r\n    the reading as preserved by Bosius, and _Z_^l that testified to by\r\n    Lambinus.\r\n\r\n  _I_ = the reading of the _editio Jensoniana_ published at Venice in\r\n    1470.\r\n\r\n  _Rom._ = the edition published at Rome in 1470.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book I   _Page_ 3\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book II       101\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book III      197\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book IV       259\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book V        337\r\n\r\n                  Letters to Atticus Book VI       415\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CICERO’S LETTERS\r\n                               TO ATTICUS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           M.

Galba is the only canvasser who is hard at work; and he meets with a\r\nplain and simple, old-fashioned, No. As people think, this unseemly\r\nhaste of his in canvassing is by no means a bad thing for my interests:\r\nfor most refusals imply a pledge of support to me. So I have hope that I\r\nmay derive some advantage from it, when the news gets abroad that my\r\nsupporters are in the majority. I had thought of beginning to canvass in\r\nthe Campus Martius at the election of tribunes on the 17th of July, the\r\nvery time that, Cincius tells me, your man will be starting with this\r\nletter. It seems certain that Galba, Antonius, and Q. Cornificius will\r\nbe standing with me. I can imagine your smile or sigh at the news. To\r\nmake you tear your hair, there are some who think Caesonius will be a\r\ncandidate too. I don’t suppose Aquilius will. He has said not, pleading\r\nhis illness and his supremacy in the law courts in excuse. Catiline will\r\nbe sure to be standing, if the verdict is, No sun at midday. Of course\r\nyou will know all about Aufidius and Palicanus, without waiting for\r\nletters from me. Of those who are standing, Caesar is thought to be a\r\ncertainty: the real fight is expected\r\n\r\nexistimatur; qui sic inopes et ab amicis et existimatione sunt, ut mihi\r\nvideatur non esse ἀδύνατον Curium obducere. Sed hoc praeter me nemini\r\nvidetur. Nostris rationibus maxime conducere videtur Thermum fieri cum\r\nCaesare. Nemo est enim ex iis, qui nunc petunt, qui, si in nostrum annum\r\nreciderit, firmior candidatus fore videatur, propterea quod curator est\r\nviae Flaminiae, quae tum erit absoluta sane facile. Eum libenter nunc\r\nCaesari consuli accuderim.[1] Petitorum haec est adhuc informata\r\ncogitatio. Nos in omni munere candidatorio fungendo summam adhibebimus\r\ndiligentiam, et fortasse, quoniam videtur in suffragiis multum posse\r\nGallia, cum Romae a iudiciis forum refrixerit, excurremus mense\r\nSeptembri legati ad Pisonem, ut Ianuario revertamur. Cum perspexero\r\nvoluntates nobilium, scribam ad te. Cetera spero prolixa esse his\r\ndumtaxat urbanis competitoribus. Illam manum tu mihi cura ut praestes,\r\nquoniam propius abes, Pompei, nostri amici. Nega me ei iratum fore, si\r\nad mea comitia non venerit. Atque haec huius modi sunt.\r\n\r\nSed est, quod abs te mihi ignosci pervelim. Caecilius, avunculus tuus, a\r\nP. Vario cum magna pecunia fraudaretur, agere coepit cum eius fratre A.\r\nCaninio Satyro de iis rebus, quas eum dolo malo mancipio accepisse de\r\nVario diceret. Una agebant ceteri creditores, in quibus erat L. Lucullus\r\net P. Scipio et, is quem putabant magistrum fore, si bona venirent, L.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  que cum (tum _Z_) erit—libenter nunc ceteri (nuntitere _M marg._:\r\n  nunciteri _Z_) consuli (concili _Z_), acciderim (acciderunt _Z_) _M\r\n  Z_^l: _the reading in the text is that of Boot_.\r\n\r\nto lie between Thermus and Silanus. But they are so unpopular and so\r\nunknown, that it seems to me to be on the cards to smuggle in Curius.\r\nNobody else thinks so, however. It would probably suit our book best for\r\nThermus to get in with Caesar: for, of the present batch of candidates,\r\nhe would be the most formidable rival if he were put off to my year, as\r\nhe is commissioner for the repairing of the Flaminian road. That will\r\neasily be finished by then: so I should like to lump him together with\r\nCaesar now. Such is the present rough guess of the chances of the\r\ncandidates. I shall take the greatest care to fulfil all a candidate’s\r\nduties: and, as Gaul’s vote counts high, I shall probably get a free\r\npass and take a run up to visit Piso, as soon as things have quieted\r\ndown in the law courts here, returning in January. When I have\r\ndiscovered the views of the upper ten, I will let you know. The rest I\r\nhope will be plain sailing, with my civilian rivals at any rate. For our\r\nfriend Pompey’s followers you must be responsible, as you are quite\r\nclose to them. Tell him I shall not take it unkindly if he does not come\r\nto my election. So much for that.\r\n\r\nBut there is a thing for which I have to crave your pardon. Your uncle,\r\nCaecilius, was cheated out of a large sum of money by P. Varius, and has\r\ntaken an action against his brother, A. Caninius Satyrus, about some\r\nproperty which he says was fraudulently made over to him by Varius. The\r\nother creditors have made common cause with him: and among them are L.\r\nLucullus and P. Scipio and the man who was expected to act for them at\r\nthe sale, if the goods were put up for auction, L. Pontius.\r\n\r\nPontius. Verum hoc ridiculum est de magistro. Nunc cognosce rem. Rogavit\r\nme Caecilius, ut adessem contra Satyrum. Dies fere nullus est, quin hic\r\nSatyrus domum meam ventitet; observat L. Domitium maxime, me habet\r\nproximum; fuit et mihi et Quinto fratri magno usui in nostri\r\npetitionibus. Sane sum perturbatus cum ipsius Satyri familiaritate tum\r\nDomiti, in quo uno maxime ambitio nostra nititur. Demonstravi haec\r\nCaecilio simul et illud ostendi, si ipse unus cum illo uno contenderet,\r\nme ei satis facturum fuisse; nunc in causa universorum creditorum,\r\nhominum praesertim amplissimorum, qui sine eo, quem Caecilius suo nomine\r\nperhiberet, facile causam communem sustinerent, aequum esse eum et\r\nofficio meo consulere et tempori. Durius accipere hoc mihi visus est,\r\nquam vellem, et quam homines belli solent, et postea prorsus ab\r\ninstituta nostra paucorum dierum consuetudine longe refugit.\r\n\r\nAbs te peto, ut mihi hoc ignoscas et me existimes humanitate esse\r\nprohibitum, ne contra amici summam existimationem miserrimo eius tempore\r\nvenirem, cum is omnia sua studia et officia in me contulisset. Quodsi\r\nvoles in me esse durior, ambitionem putabis mihi obstitisse. Ego autem\r\narbitror, etiamsi id sit, mihi ignoscendum esse,\r\n\r\n                     ἐπεὶ οὐχ ἱερήιον οὐδὲ βοείην.\r\n\r\nVides enim, in quo cursu simus et quam omnes gratias non modo\r\nretinendas, verum etiam acquirendas\r\n\r\nBut it is absurd to talk of acting for them at present. Now for the\r\npoint. Caecilius asked me to take a brief against Satyrus. Now there is\r\nhardly a day but Satyrus pays me a visit. He is most attentive to L.\r\nDomitius and after him to me, and he was of great assistance to me and\r\nto my brother Quintus when we were canvassing. I am really embarrassed\r\non account of the friendliness of Satyrus himself and of Domitius, who\r\nis the mainstay of my hopes. I pointed this out to Caecilius, assuring\r\nhim at the same time that, if he stood alone against Satyrus, I would\r\nhave done my best for him: but, as things were, when the creditors had\r\ncombined and were such influential persons that they would easily win\r\ntheir case without any special advocate whom Caecilius might retain on\r\nhis own account, it was only fair for him to consider my obligations and\r\nmy circumstances. He seemed to take it more ungraciously than I could\r\nhave wished or than a gentleman should: and afterwards he withdrew\r\nentirely from the intimacy which had grown up between us in the last few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nPlease try to forgive me and to believe that delicacy prevented me from\r\nappearing against a friend whose very good name was at stake, in the\r\nhour of his misfortune, when the friendly attentions he had paid to me\r\nhad been unfailing. If you cannot take so kind a view, pray consider\r\nthat my candidature stood in the way. I think even so I may be forgiven:\r\nfor there is not “a trifle, some eightpenny matter,”[2] at [Sidenote:\r\nIliad xxii, 159] stake. You know the game I am playing, and how\r\nimportant it is for me to keep in with every one and\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Lit. “Since it was not for a victim for sacrifice nor for an oxhide\r\n  shield (they strove).”\r\n\r\nputemus.

I am expecting you back by January—from mere\r\nhearsay, or was it perhaps from letters you have sent to others? You\r\nhave not said anything about it to me. The statues you have obtained for\r\nme have been landed at Caieta. I’ve not seen them yet, as I’ve not had a\r\nchance of getting away from town: but I’ve sent a man to pay for the\r\ncarriage. Many thanks for the trouble you’ve taken in getting them—so\r\ncheaply too.\r\n\r\nYou keep writing to me to make your peace with our friend. I have tried\r\nevery means I know: but it is surprising how estranged he is from you. I\r\nexpect you have heard what he thinks about you: anyhow I’ll let you know\r\nwhen you come. I have not been able to restore the old terms of intimacy\r\nbetween him and Sallustius, though the latter was on the spot. I mention\r\nit because Sallustius used to grumble at me about you. Now he has found\r\nout that our friend is not so easy to appease, and that I have done my\r\nbest for both of you. Our little Tullia is engaged to C.

You will be in time for my\r\nbrother Quintus’ election: you will see me after all this long while;\r\nand you will settle the bother with Acutilius. The latter point\r\nPeducaeus too suggested that I should mention to you: we think it would\r\nbe much better for you to get the thing settled at last. I am and have\r\nlong been ready to use my influence for you. You would never believe how\r\npleased every one is with my conduct of Macer’s case.

It is a most suitable\r\nornament for my Academy, since no class-room is complete without a\r\nHermes, and Minerva has a special appropriateness in mine. So please do\r\nas you suggest and send as many ornaments as possible for the place. The\r\nstatues you sent before I have not seen yet. They are in my house at\r\nFormiae, where I am just thinking of going. I’ll have them all brought\r\nto my place at Tusculum, and, if that ever gets too full, I’ll begin\r\ndecorating Caieta.

He has always\r\n\r\nalterius et moribus homini accidere possunt, ex illo accidebant. Quare\r\nnon dubito, quin tibi quoque id molestum sit, cum et meo dolore moveare\r\net ipse omni virtute officioque ornatissimum tuique et sua sponte et meo\r\nsermone amantem adfinem amicumque amiseris.\r\n\r\nQuod ad me scribis de sorore tua, testis erit tibi ipsa, quantae mihi\r\ncurae fuerit, ut Quinti fratris animus in eam esset is, qui esse\r\ndeberet. Quem cum esse offensiorem arbitrarer, eas litteras ad eum misi,\r\nquibus et placarem ut fratrem et monerem ut minorem et obiurgarem ut\r\nerrantem. Itaque ex iis, quae postea saepe ab eo ad me scripta sunt,\r\nconfido ita esse omnia, ut et oporteat et velimus.\r\n\r\nDe litterarum missione sine causa abs te accusor. Numquam enim a\r\nPomponia nostra certior sum factus esse, cui dare litteras possem, porro\r\nautem neque mihi accidit, ut haberem, qui in Epirum proficisceretur,\r\nnequedum te Athenis esse audiebamus. De Acutiliano autem negotio quod\r\nmihi mandaras, ut primum a tuo digressu Romam veni, confeceram; sed\r\naccidit, ut et contentione nihil opus esset, et ut ego, qui in te satis\r\nconsilii statuerim esse, mallem Peducaeum tibi consilium per litteras\r\nquam me dare. Etenim, cum multos dies aures meas Acutilio dedissem,\r\ncuius sermonis genus tibi notum esse arbitror, non mihi grave duxi\r\nscribere ad te de illius querimoniis, cum eas audire, quod erat\r\nsubodiosum, leve putassem. Sed abs te ipso, qui me accusas, unas mihi\r\nscito litteras redditas esse, cum et otii ad scribendum plus et\r\nfacultatem dandi maiorem habueris.\r\n\r\nQuod scribis, etiamsi cuius animus in te esset\r\n\r\nbeen kindness itself to me, and has rendered me every service a friend\r\ncould. I am sure you too will feel it, partly out of sympathy with me,\r\nand partly because you will miss a dear and valued friend and relative,\r\nwho was attached to you of his own accord and at my prompting.\r\n\r\nYou mention your sister. She herself will tell you the pains I have\r\ntaken to make my brother Quintus behave as he should to her. When I\r\nthought he was a little annoyed, I wrote to him trying to smooth matters\r\ndown with him as a brother, to give him good advice as my junior and to\r\nremonstrate with him as in error. Judging by all the letters I have had\r\nfrom him since, I trust things are as they should be and as we wish them\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nYou have no reason to complain of lack of letters from me, as Pomponia\r\nhas never let me know when there was a messenger to give them to.\r\nBesides it has so happened that I have not had anyone starting for\r\nEpirus and have not yet heard of your arrival at Athens. Acutilius’\r\nbusiness I settled according to your directions, as soon as ever I got\r\nto Rome after your departure: but, as it happened, there was no hurry,\r\nand, knowing I could trust your good judgement, I preferred Peducaeus to\r\nadvise you by letter rather than myself. It was not the bother of\r\nwriting you an account of his grievances that I shirked. I spent several\r\ndays listening to him, and you know his way of talking; and I did not\r\nmind, though it was a bit of a bore. Though you grumble at me, I’ve only\r\nhad one letter from you, let me tell you, and you have had more time to\r\nwrite and a better chance of sending letters than I’ve had.\r\n\r\nYou say, “if so and so is a little annoyed with\r\n\r\noffensior, a me recolligi oportere, teneo, quid dicas, neque id neglexi,\r\nsed est miro quodam modo adfectus. Ego autem, quae dicenda fuerunt de\r\nte, non praeterii; quid autem contendendum esset, ex tua putabam\r\nvoluntate me statuere oportere.

I should have done it before of my own\r\naccord: but now that I see from your note that you have set your heart\r\non it, I’ll give my mind to it and try harder than ever to win him over.\r\nI would have you to know that he is very seriously annoyed with you:\r\nbut, as I cannot see any serious ground for his annoyance, I hope I\r\nshall find him pliable and amenable to my influence.\r\n\r\nPlease do as you say about the statues and the Hermeraclae: and have\r\nthem shipped as soon as you can conveniently, and any other things you\r\ncome across that are suitable for the place—you know what it is\r\nlike—especially for the Palaestra and Gymnasium. That’s where I am\r\nsitting and writing now, so my thoughts naturally run on it. I give you\r\na commission too for bas-reliefs for insertion in the stucco walls of\r\nthe hall, and for two well-covers in carved relief. Be sure you don’t\r\npromise your library to anyone, however ardent a suitor you may find for\r\nit. I am saving up all my little gleanings to buy it as a prop for my\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nMy brother’s affairs are, I trust, as I have always wished them to be\r\nand striven to make them. Everything points that way, and not the least\r\nthat your sister is enceinte. As for my election, I’ve not forgotten\r\nthat I gave you leave to stop away: and I’ve already warned our common\r\nfriends, who expect you to come, that I’ve not only forborne to ask you\r\nto do so, but even forbidden it, knowing that present business is of\r\nmuch more importance to you than your presence at my election would be\r\nto me. I should like you to feel exactly as though it were my business\r\nwhich\r\n\r\ncausa in ista loca missus esses; me autem eum et offendes erga te et\r\naudies, quasi mihi, si quae parta erunt, non modo te praesente, sed per\r\nte parta sint.

Eo accedebat\r\nhortator adsiduus Sallustius, ut agerem quam diligentissime cum Lucceio\r\nde vestra vetere gratia reconcilianda. Sed, cum omnia fecissem, non modo\r\neam voluntatem eius, quae fuerat erga te, recuperare non potui, verum ne\r\ncausam quidem elicere immutatae voluntatis. Tametsi iactat ille quidem\r\nillud suum arbitrium, et ea, quae iam tum, cum aderas, offendere eius\r\nanimum intellegebam, tamen habet quiddam profecto, quod magis in animo\r\neius insederit, quod neque epistulae tuae neque nostra adlegatio tam\r\npotest facile delere, quam tu praesens non modo oratione, sed tuo vultu\r\nillo familiari tolles, si modo tanti putaris, id quod, si me audies et\r\nsi humanitati tuae constare voles, certe putabis.

Besides Sallustius was continually pressing me to do my best to\r\nreplace you on your old friendly footing with Lucceius. But when I had\r\ndone the uttermost, I failed not only to win back his old affection for\r\nyou, but even to extract from him the reason for his change of feelings\r\ntowards you. Though he is continually harping on that arbitration case\r\nof his, and the other things which I noticed provoked him when you were\r\nhere, there is something else, I am sure, which is rankling in his mind.\r\nAnd this your presence, a talk with him, and still more the sight of\r\nyour familiar face, would do more to remove than either your letters or\r\nmy services as intermediary, if you think it worth while to come. And,\r\nif you will listen to me and are disposed to act with your usual\r\ncourtesy, you will certainly think it worth while. You would never\r\nbelieve how self-willed and stiff-necked he seems to be on the point: so\r\ndon’t be astonished that I now appear to doubt my ability to manage him,\r\nthough in former letters I hinted that I thought he would\r\n\r\nobstinatior et in hac iracundia offirmatior.

Under my\r\ncircumstances I couldn’t honourably champion him. I should lose the\r\nrespect of both parties if I did: and what’s more, I wouldn’t, if I\r\ncould, in view of certain things that have happened, to which I should\r\nlike to call your attention. There’s a freedman of mine, an utter\r\nscoundrel—Hilarus I mean—an accountant and a client of yours. Valerius\r\nthe interpreter sends me news of him, and Thyillus says he has heard too\r\nthat the fellow is with Antony, and that Antony, when he is making\r\nrequisitions, always asserts that part is levied on my authority, and\r\nthat I have sent a freedman to look after my share. I am considerably\r\nannoyed, though I hardly believe the story: but there has been a good\r\ndeal of talk. Look into the matter thoroughly and try to get to the\r\nbottom of it, and, if you possibly can, get that rascal shifted.\r\nValerius mentioned Cn. Plancius as his authority for the statement. I\r\nleave the whole matter entirely in your hands to investigate.\r\n\r\nI am assured that Pompey is on the best of terms with me. Mucia’s\r\ndivorce meets with every one’s approval. I expect you have heard that P.\r\nClodius, son of Appius, was discovered in woman’s clothes in C. Caesar’s\r\nhouse, where the sacrifice was going on: but a servant girl managed to\r\nsmuggle him out. It has created a public scandal: and I am sure you will\r\nbe sorry to hear of it.\r\n\r\nI don’t think I have any other news for you: and I’m sorry to say I’ve\r\nbeen rather upset while writing. My reader Sositheus, a charming fellow,\r\nhas died; and I am more upset about it than anyone would suppose I\r\nshould be about a slave’s death. Please\r\n\r\nTu velim saepe ad nos scribas.

Cornelius, to whom you gave\r\nit, I think at the Three Taverns; another brought by your host at\r\nCanusium; and a third which you say you posted from the boat just as you\r\ngot under weigh. All three of them were, as a pupil in the rhetorical\r\nschools would say, at once sprinkled with the salt of refinement and\r\nstamped with the brand of affection. They certainly provoke an answer:\r\nbut I have been rather slow about sending one, for lack of a safe\r\nmessenger. There are very few who can carry a letter of weight without\r\nlightening it by a perusal. Besides, I don’t hear of every traveller to\r\nEpirus. For I suppose, when you have offered sacrifice at your villa\r\nAmalthea, you will start at once to lay siege to Sicyon. I’m not certain\r\neither how or when you are going to join Antony or how long you will\r\nstay in Epirus. So I dare not trust at all outspoken letters to people\r\ngoing either to Achaia or to Epirus.\r\n\r\nPlenty of things have happened worth writing about since your departure,\r\nbut I dared not commit them to the risk of the letters being either lost\r\nor opened or intercepted. First then let me tell you I was not asked my\r\nopinion first in the House, but had to play second fiddle to the\r\n“peace-maker” of the\r\n\r\nAllobrogum, idque admurmurante senatu neque me invito esse factum. Sum\r\nenim et ab observando homine perverso liber et ad dignitatem in re\r\npublica retinendam contra illius voluntatem solutus, et ille secundus in\r\ndicendo locus habet auctoritatem paene principis et voluntatem non nimis\r\ndevinctam beneficio consulis. Tertius est Catulus, quartus, si etiam hoc\r\nquaeris, Hortensius. Consul autem ipse parvo animo et pravo tamen\r\ncavillator genere illo moroso, quod etiam sine dicacitate ridetur, facie\r\nmagis quam facetiis ridiculus, nihil agens cum re publica, seiunctus ab\r\noptimatibus, a quo nihil speres boni rei publicae, quia non vult, nihil\r\nsperes mali, quia non audet. Eius autem collega et in me perhonorificus\r\net partium studiosus ac defensor bonarum. Qui nunc leviter inter se\r\ndissident. Sed vereor, ne hoc, quod infectum est, serpat longius. Credo\r\nenim te audisse, cum apud Caesarem pro populo fieret, venisse eo\r\nmuliebri vestitu virum, idque sacrificium cum virgines instaurassent;\r\nmentionem a Q. Cornificio in senatu factam (is fuit princeps, ne tu\r\nforte aliquem nostrum putes); postea rem ex senatus consulto ad virgines\r\natque ad pontifices relatam idque ab iis nefas esse decretum; deinde ex\r\nsenatus consulto consules rogationem promulgasse; uxori Caesarem nuntium\r\nremisisse. In hac causa Piso amicitia P. Clodi ductus\r\n\r\nAllobroges.[13] Nor did I mind much, though the senate murmured\r\ndisapproval. It has freed me from the necessity of bowing to a crotchety\r\nindividual, and sets me at liberty to preserve my political dignity in\r\nspite of him. The second place carries nearly as much weight with it as\r\nthe first, and one’s actions are not so much bound by obligation to the\r\nconsul. The third place fell to Catulus: the fourth, if you want to go\r\nas far, to Hortensius. The consul is petty-minded and perverse, a\r\nquibbler who used that bitter kind of sarcasm, which raises a laugh even\r\nwhen there is no wit in the words, on the strength of his expression\r\nrather than his expressions. He is no politician at all, he stands aloof\r\nfrom the conservatives: and one cannot expect him to render any good\r\nservices to the state, because he does not wish to do so, nor any bad,\r\nbecause he does not dare. But his colleague is most polite to me, a keen\r\npolitician and a bulwark of the conservative party. There is a slight\r\ndifference of opinion between them at present: but I am afraid that the\r\ncontagion may spread. No doubt you have heard that, when the sacrifice\r\nwas taking place in Caesar’s house, a man in woman’s clothes got in; and\r\nthat after the Vestal Virgins had performed the sacrifice afresh, the\r\nmatter was mentioned in the House by Cornificius. Note that he was the\r\nprime mover and none of us. Then a resolution was passed, the matter was\r\nreferred to the Virgins and the priests, and they pronounced it a\r\nsacrilege. So the consuls were directed by the House to bring in a bill\r\nabout it. Caesar has divorced his wife. Piso’s friendship\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  C. Calpurnius Piso, consul in 67 B.C. and governor of Gallia\r\n  Narbonensis in 66–65 B.C. He had temporarily pacified the Allobroges,\r\n  but they were already in revolt again.\r\n\r\noperam dat, ut ea rogatio, quam ipse fert et fert ex senatus consulto et\r\nde religione, antiquetur. Messalla vehementer adhuc agit severe. Boni\r\nviri precibus Clodi removentur a causa, operae comparantur, nosmet ipsi,\r\nqui Lycurgei a principio fuissemus, cotidie demitigamur, instat et urget\r\nCato. Quid multa? Vereor, ne haec neglecta a bonis, defensa ab improbis\r\nmagnorum rei publicae malorum causa sit. Tuus autem ille amicus (scin,\r\nquem dicam?), de quo tu ad me scripsisti, posteaquam non auderet\r\nreprehendere, laudare coepisse, nos, ut ostendit, admodum diligit,\r\namplectitur; amat, aperte laudat, occulte, sed ita, ut perspicuum sit,\r\ninvidet. Nihil come, nihil simplex, nihil ἐν τοῖς πολιτικοῖς illustre,\r\nnihil honestum, nihil forte, nihil liberum. Sed haec ad te scribam alias\r\nsubtilius; nam neque adhuc mihi satis nota sunt, et huic terrae filio\r\nnescio cui committere epistulam tantis de rebus non audeo.\r\n\r\nProvincias praetores nondum sortiti sunt.

In illam orationem Metellinam\r\n\r\nfor Clodius is making him do his best to have the bill shelved, though\r\nhe is the person who has to bring it forward under the House’s\r\norders—and a bill for sacrilege too! Messalla at present takes a strict\r\nview of the case. The conservatives are dropping out of it under\r\npersuasion from Clodius. Gangs of rowdies are being formed. I, who at\r\nfirst was a perfect Lycurgus, am daily cooling down. Cato, however, is\r\npressing the case with energy. But enough. I am afraid that what with\r\nthe lack of interest shown in the case by the conservatives, and its\r\nchampionship by the socialists, it may cause a lot of mischief to the\r\nstate. Your friend[14]—you know whom I mean, the man who, you say, began\r\nto praise me as soon as he feared to blame me—is now parading his\r\naffection for me openly and ostentatiously; but in his heart of hearts\r\nhe is envious, and he does not disguise it very well. He is totally\r\nlacking in courtesy, candour, in brilliancy in his politics, as well as\r\nin sense of honour, resolution and generosity. But I’ll write more fully\r\nabout that another time. I’ve not got hold of the facts properly yet,\r\nand I dare not trust an important letter to a man in the street like\r\nthis messenger.\r\n\r\nThe praetors have not drawn their provinces yet: and things are just as\r\nthey were when you left. I will insert a description of Misenum and\r\nPuteoli in my speech as you suggest. I had already spotted the mistake\r\nin the date, Dec. 3. The passages in my speeches which took your fancy\r\nwere, do you know, just those that I was proud of, but didn’t like to\r\nsay so before: and after Atticus’ approval they look much more Attic in\r\nmy eyes. I have added a\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Pompey.\r\n\r\naddidi quaedam. Liber tibi mittetur, quoniam te amor nostri φιλορήτορα\r\nreddidit.\r\n\r\nNovi tibi quidnam scribam? quid? etiam.

If it is supposed to stand for ¯CXXXIV¯\r\n  (i.e. 13,400,000 sesterces) it would be too large. Tyrrell suggests\r\n  reading ¯XXXIV¯ (i.e. 3,400,000 sesterces), about £30,000.\r\n\r\nPompeium. Res agebatur in circo Flaminio, et erat in eo ipso loco illo\r\ndie nundinarum πανήγυρις. Quaesivit ex eo, placeretne ei iudices a\r\npraetore legi, quo consilio idem praetor uteretur. Id autem erat de\r\nClodiana religione ab senatu constitutum. Tum Pompeius μάλ’\r\nἀριστοκρατικῶς locutus est senatusque auctoritatem sibi omnibus in rebus\r\nmaximam videri semperque visam esse respondit et id multis verbis.\r\nPostea Messalla consul in senatu de Pompeio quaesivit, quid de religione\r\net de promulgata rogatione sentiret. Locutus ita est in senatu, ut omnia\r\nillius ordinis consulta γενικῶς laudaret, mihique, ut adsedit, dixit se\r\nputare satis ab se etiam “de istis rebus” esse responsum. Crassus\r\nposteaquam vidit illum excepisse laudem ex eo, quod suspicarentur\r\nhomines ei consulatum meum placere, surrexit ornatissimeque de meo\r\nconsulatu locutus est, cum ita diceret, “se, quod esset senator, quod\r\ncivis, quod liber, quod viveret, mihi acceptum referre; quotiens\r\nconiugem, quotiens domum, quotiens patriam videret, totiens se\r\nbeneficium meum videre.” Quid multa? totum hunc locum, quem ego varie\r\nmeis orationibus, quarum tu Aristarchus es, soleo pingere, de flamma, de\r\nferro (nosti illas ληκύθους), valde graviter pertexuit. Proximus Pompeio\r\nsedebam. Intellexi hominem moveri, utrum Crassum inire eam gratiam, quam\r\nipse\r\n\r\nneeds trot out Pompey to deliver an harangue. This happened in the\r\nCircus Flaminius, where there was the usual market-day gathering of\r\nriff-raff. Fufius asked him whether he agreed with the proposal that the\r\npraetor should have the selection of the jurymen and then use them as\r\nhis panel. That of course was the plan proposed by the Senate in\r\nClodius’ trial for sacrilege. To this Pompey replied _en grand seigneur_\r\nthat he felt and always had felt the greatest respect for the Senate’s\r\nauthority; and very long-winded he was about it. Afterwards the consul\r\nMessalla asked Pompey in the Senate for his opinion on the sacrilege and\r\nthe proposed bill. He delivered a speech eulogizing the Senate’s\r\nmeasures _en bloc_, and said to me as he sat down at my side, that he\r\nthought he had given a sufficiently clear answer to “those questions.”\r\nCrassus no sooner saw that he had won public appreciation, because\r\npeople fancied that he approved of my consulship, than up he got and\r\nspoke of it in the most complimentary way. He said that he owed his seat\r\nin the House, his privileges as a citizen, his freedom and his very\r\nlife, to me. He never saw his wife’s face, or his home, or his native\r\nland, without recognizing the debt he owed to me. But enough. He worked\r\nup with great effect all that purple patch which I so often use here and\r\nthere to adorn my speeches, to which you play Aristarchus[16]—the\r\npassage about fire and sword—you know the paints I have on my palette. I\r\nwas sitting next to Pompey, and noticed that he was much affected,\r\npossibly at seeing Crassus\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  An Alexandrine grammarian noted especially for his criticism of the\r\n  Homeric poems, in which he detected many spurious lines.\r\n\r\npraetermisisset, an esse tantas res nostras, quae tam libenti senatu\r\nlaudarentur, ab eo praesertim, qui mihi laudem illam eo minus deberet,\r\nquod meis omnibus litteris in Pompeiana laude perstrictus esset. Hic\r\ndies me valde Crasso adiunxit, et tamen ab illo aperte tecte quicquid\r\nest datum, libenter accepi. Ego autem ipse, di boni! quo modo\r\nἐνεπερπερευσάμην novo auditori Pompeio! Si umquam mihi περίοδοι, si\r\nκαμπαί, si ἐνθυμήματα, si κατασκευαί suppeditaverunt, illo tempore. Quid\r\nmulta? clamores. Etenim haec erat ὑπόθεσις, de gravitate ordinis, de\r\nequestri concordia, de consensione Italiae, de intermortuis reliquiis\r\nconiurationis, de vilitate, de otio. Nosti iam in hac materia sonitus\r\nnostros. Tanti fuerunt, ut ego eo brevior sim, quod eos usque istinc\r\nexauditos putem.\r\n\r\nRomanae autem se res sic habent. Senatus Ἄρειος πάγος; nihil\r\nconstantius, nihil severius, nihil fortius. Nam, cum dies venisset\r\nrogationi ex senatus consulto ferendae, concursabant barbatuli iuvenes,\r\ntotus ille grex Catilinae, duce filiola Curionis et populum, ut\r\nantiquaret, rogabant. Piso autem consul lator rogationis idem erat\r\ndissuasor. Operae Clodianae pontes occuparant, tabellae ministrabantur\r\nita, ut nulla daretur “VTI ROGAS.” Hic tibi in rostra Cato advolat,\r\n\r\nsnap up the chance of winning popularity, which he had thrown away, and\r\nperhaps at realizing the importance of my achievements, when he saw that\r\npraise of them met with the Senate’s entire approval, especially coming\r\nfrom one who had all the less necessity to praise me, because in every\r\none of my works he has been censured for Pompey’s benefit. To-day has\r\ndone a great deal to cement my friendship with Crassus: but still I\r\ngladly received any crumbs Pompey let fall openly or covertly.[17] As\r\nfor me, ye gods, how I showed off before my new listener Pompey! Then,\r\nif ever, my flow of rounded periods, my easy transitions, my antitheses,\r\nmy constructive arguments stood me in good stead. In a word, loud\r\napplause! For the gist of it was the importance of the Senatorial order,\r\nits unison with the knights, the concord of all Italy, the paralysed\r\nremains of the conspiracy, peace and plenty. You know how I can thunder\r\non a subject like that. This time my thunders were so loud that I\r\nforbear to say any more about them. I expect you heard them right over\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWell, there you have the news of the town. The Senate is a perfect\r\nAreopagus, all seriousness, steadfastness and firmness. For when the\r\ntime came for passing the Senate’s measure, all those callow youths,\r\nCatiline’s cubs, met under the leadership of Curio’s feminine son, and\r\nasked the people to reject it. The consul Piso had to propose the law,\r\nbut spoke against it. Clodius’ rowdies held the gangways; and the voting\r\npapers were so managed that no _placet_ forms were given out. Then you\r\nhave Cato flying to the\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Or “let fall with obvious covertness”; or “I openly received what he\r\n  covertly gave.”\r\n\r\ncommulcium Pisoni consuli mirificum facit, si id est commulcium,[18] vox\r\nplena gravitatis, plena auctoritatis, plena denique salutis. Accedit\r\neodem etiam noster Hortensius, multi praeterea boni; insignis vero opera\r\nFavoni fuit. Hoc concursu optimatium comitia dimittuntur, senatus\r\nvocatur. Cum decerneretur frequenti senatu contra pugnante Pisone, ad\r\npedes omnium singillatim accidente Clodio, ut consules populum\r\ncohortarentur ad rogationem accipiendam, homines ad quindecim Curioni\r\nnullum senatus consultum facienti adsenserunt, ex altera parte facile\r\nCCCC fuerunt. Acta res est. Fufius tribunus tum concessit. Clodius\r\ncontiones miseras habebat, in quibus Lucullum, Hortensium, C. Pisonem,\r\nMessallam consulem contumeliose laedebat; me tantum “comperisse” omnia\r\ncriminabatur. Senatus et de provinciis praetorum et de legationibus et\r\nde ceteris rebus decernebat, ut, antequam rogatio lata esset, ne quid\r\nageretur.\r\n\r\nHabes res Romanas.

Our friend Hortensius joined him too, and many other\r\nloyalists, Favonius particularly distinguishing himself for his energy.\r\nThis rally of the conservatives broke up the meeting, and the Senate was\r\ncalled together. In a full house a resolution was passed that persuasion\r\nshould be used to induce the people to accept the measure, though Piso\r\nopposed it and Clodius went down on his knees to us one by one. Some\r\nfifteen supported Curio’s rejection of the bill, while the opposite\r\nparty numbered easily 400. That settled the matter. Funfius the tribune\r\ncollapsed. Clodius delivered some pitiful harangues, in which he hurled\r\nreproaches at Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and the consul Messalla: me\r\nhe only twitted with my sensational discoveries.[19] The Senate decided\r\nthat no action was to be taken as to the distribution of provinces among\r\nthe praetors, hearing of legations or anything else, till this measure\r\nwas passed.\r\n\r\nThere you have the political situation. But there is one piece of news I\r\nmust tell you, as it is better than I expected. Messalla is an excellent\r\nconsul, resolute, reliable and energetic: for me he expresses admiration\r\nand respect, and shows it by imitating me. That other fellow has only\r\none redeeming vice, laziness, sleepiness, ignorance, and _fainéance_:\r\nbut at heart he is such a _mauvais sujet_ that he began to\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Cicero had contented himself at the time he unmasked Catiline with\r\n  declaring-that he had “discovered” (_comperisse_) full details without\r\n  making them public.

Quint. a. 693_]\r\n\r\nQuaeris ex me, quid acciderit de iudicio, quod tam praeter opinionem\r\nomnium factum sit, et simul vis scire, quo modo ego minus, quam soleam,\r\nproeliatus sim. Respondebo tibi ὕστερον πρότερον Ὁμηρικῶς. Ego enim,\r\nquam diu senatus auctoritas mihi defendenda fuit, sic acriter et\r\nvehementer proeliatus sum, ut clamor concursusque maxima cum mea laude\r\nfierent. Quodsi tibi umquam sum visus in re publica fortis, certe me in\r\nilla causa admiratus esses. Cum enim ille ad contiones confugisset in\r\niisque meo nomine ad invidiam uteretur, di immortales! quas ego pugnas\r\net quantas strages edidi! quos impetus in Pisonem, in Curionem, in totam\r\nillam manum feci! quo modo sum insectatus levitatem senum, libidinem\r\niuventutis! Saepe, ita me di iuvent! te non solum auctorem consiliorum\r\nmeorum, verum etiam spectatorem pugnarum mirificarum desideravi. Postea\r\nvero quam Hortensius excogitavit, ut legem de religione Fufius tribunus\r\npl. ferret, in qua nihil aliud a consulari rogatione differebat nisi\r\niudicum genus (in eo autem erant omnia), pugnavitque, ut ita fieret,\r\nquod et sibi et aliis persuaserat nullis illum iudicibus effugere\r\n\r\ngive to Quintus himself. Please let me know which of my orders you have\r\ncarried out, and how your own affairs are getting on. I haven’t had a\r\nsingle letter from you since you left Brundisium: and I badly want to\r\nknow how you are.

Well! In my answer I’ll put the cart before the horse like\r\nHomer. So long as I had to defend the Senate’s decree, I fought so\r\nfiercely and doughtily, that cheering crowds rallied round me\r\nenthusiastic in my applause. You would certainly have marvelled at my\r\ncourage on this occasion, if ever you credited me with any courage in my\r\ncountry’s defence. When Clodius fell back on speechifying and took my\r\nname in vain, didn’t I just show fight, didn’t I deal havoc! How I\r\ncharged Piso, Curio, and all that crowd! Didn’t I rate the old men for\r\ntheir frivolity, the young for their wanton passions! Heaven is my\r\nwitness, I often wanted you not only to prompt my plans, but also to be\r\na spectator of my doughty deeds. But when Hortensius had conceived the\r\nidea of letting Fufius bring in his bill about the sacrilege, which only\r\ndiffered from the consular measure in the method of choosing the\r\njury—though that was the point on which everything turned—and fought for\r\nhis own way, under the impression, which he had also conveyed to others,\r\nthat no conceivable\r\n\r\nposse, contraxi vela perspiciens inopiam iudicum, neque dixi quicquam\r\npro testimonio, nisi quod erat ita notum atque testatum, ut non possem\r\npraeterire. Itaque, si causam quaeris absolutionis, ut iam πρὸς τὸ\r\nπρότερον revertar, egestas iudicum fuit et turpitudo. Id autem ut\r\naccideret, commissum est Hortensi consilio, qui dum veritus est, ne\r\nFufius ei legi intercederet, quae ex senatus consulto ferebatur, non\r\nvidit illud, satius esse illum in infamia relinqui ac sordibus quam\r\ninfirmo iudicio committi, sed ductus odio properavit rem deducere in\r\niudicium, cum illum plumbeo gladio iugulatum iri tamen diceret.\r\n\r\nSed iudicium si quaeris quale fuerit, incredibili exitu, sic uti nunc ex\r\neventu ab aliis, a me tamen ex ipso initio consilium Hortensi\r\nreprehendatur. Nam, ut reiectio facta est clamoribus maximis, cum\r\naccusator tamquam censor bonus homines nequissimos reiceret, reus\r\ntamquam clemens lanista frugalissimum quemque secerneret, ut primum\r\niudices consederunt, valde diffidere boni coeperunt. Non enim umquam\r\nturpior in ludo talario consessus fuit, maculosi senatores, nudi\r\nequites, tribuni non tam aerati quam, ut appellantur, aerarii. Pauci\r\ntamen boni inerant, quos reiectione fugare ille non potuerat, qui maesti\r\ninter sui dissimiles et maerentes sedebant et contagione\r\n\r\njury could acquit Clodius, I drew in a reef or two, not being blind to\r\nthe impecuniosity of the jurymen. I confined my testimony to points so\r\nthoroughly well-known and attested that I could not omit them. So, to\r\ncome at last to the “horse,” if you want to know the reason for his\r\nacquittal, it lay in the jury’s lack of pence and of conscience. But it\r\nwas Hortensius’ plan that made such a result possible. In his fright\r\nthat Fufius might veto the Senate’s measure, he overlooked the fact that\r\nit would be better for Clodius to be kept in disgrace with a trial\r\nhanging over his head, than for the case to come before an unsound\r\ncourt. Spurred on by hatred, he rushed the matter into court, saying\r\nthat a leaden sword was sharp enough to cut Clodius’ throat.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know about the trial, the result of it was so incredible\r\nthat now after the event everybody agrees with my forebodings and blames\r\nHortensius. The challenging of the jury took place amidst an uproar,\r\nsince the prosecutor like a good censor rejected all the knaves, and the\r\ndefendant like a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators set aside all the\r\nrespectable people. And as soon as the jury took their seats, the\r\npatriotic party began to have grave misgivings: for never did a more\r\ndisreputable set of people get together even in a gambling hell.\r\nSenators with a past, knights without a penny, tribunes whose only right\r\nto a title implying pay lay in their readiness to take it.[21] The few\r\nhonest folk among them, that he had not managed to remove in his\r\nselection, sat as woe-begone as fish out of water,\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Or keeping the ordinary sense of “aerarii”: “cashiered rather than\r\n  rich in cash.” But the sense both of “aerati” and of “aerarii” here is\r\n  very doubtful.\r\n\r\nturpitudinis vehementer permovebantur. Hic, ut quaeque res ad consilium\r\nprimis postulationibus referebatur, incredibilis erat severitas nulla\r\nvarietate sententiarum. Nihil impetrabat reus, plus accusatori dabatur,\r\nquam postulabat; triumphabat (quid quaeris?) Hortensius se vidisse\r\ntantum; nemo erat, qui illum reum ac non miliens condemnatum\r\narbitraretur. Me vero teste producto credo te ex acclamatione Clodi\r\nadvocatorum audisse quae consurrectio iudicum facta sit, ut me\r\ncircumsteterint, ut aperte iugula sua pro meo capite P. Clodio\r\nostentarint. Quae mihi res multo honorificentior visa est quam aut illa,\r\ncum iurare tui cives Xenocratem testimonium dicentem prohibuerunt, aut\r\ncum tabulas Metelli Numidici, cum eae, ut mos est, circumferrentur,\r\nnostri iudices aspicere noluerunt. Multo haec, inquam, nostra res maior.\r\nItaque iudicum vocibus, cum ego sic ab iis ut salus patriae defenderer,\r\nfractus reus et una patroni omnes conciderunt; ad me autem eadem\r\nfrequentia postridie convenit, quacum abiens consulatu sum domum\r\nreductus. Clamare praeclari Areopagitae se non esse venturos nisi\r\npraesidio constituto. Refertur ad consilium. Una sola sententia\r\npraesidium non desideravit. Defertur res ad senatum. Gravissime\r\nornatissimeque decernitur; laudantur iudices; datur negotium\r\nmagistratibus. Responsurum hominem nemo arbitrabatur.\r\n\r\n                       Ἔσπετε νῦν μοι, Μοῦσαι —\r\n                       ὅππως δὴ πρῶτον πῦρ ἔμπεσε\r\n\r\nsadly upset and bemoaning their contact with infamy. At the preliminary\r\nproceedings, as point after point was put before the jury, their strict\r\nand unanimous uprightness was extraordinary. The defendant never won a\r\npoint, and the prosecution were granted more than they asked for. It\r\ngoes without saying that Hortensius was triumphant at his penetration;\r\nand no one regarded Clodius so much as a man on his trial as one that\r\nhad been condemned a thousand times over.\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt heard how the jury rose in a body to protect me, when\r\nI stepped into the witness-box and Clodius’ supporters began to hoot:\r\nand how they offered their throats to Clodius’ sword in defence of me.\r\nThereby, to my mind they paid me a far higher compliment than your\r\nfellow-citizens paid Xenocrates, when they refused to let him take the\r\noath before giving his testimony, or our Roman jury paid Metellus\r\nNumidicus, when they would not look at the accounts which he passed\r\nround as is usual in such cases. I repeat, the honour shown me was far\r\ngreater. The shouts of the jury, proclaiming me as the saviour of the\r\ncountry crushed and annihilated the defendant and all his supporters.\r\nAnd on the next day a crowd as great as that which conducted me home at\r\nthe end of my consulship gathered round me. Our noble Areopagites\r\ndeclared they would not come without a guard. The votes of the court\r\nwere taken, and there was only one person who voted a guard unnecessary.\r\nThe point was laid before the Senate, who passed a decree in the\r\nstrongest and most complimentary terms, thanking the jury and referring\r\nthe matter to the magistrates. No one thought Clodius would defend his\r\ncase. “Tell me [Sidenote: Iliad xvi, 112] now, ye Muses, how first the\r\nfire fell.”\r\n\r\nNosti Calvum ex Nanneianis illum, illum laudatorem meum, de cuius\r\noratione erga me honorifica ad te scripseram.

He sent for everybody,\r\nmade promises, gave security, paid money down. Good heavens, what a\r\nscandal there was! Even the favours of certain ladies and introductions\r\nto young men of good family were given to some of the jury to swell the\r\nbribe. All honest men withdrew entirely from the case and the forum was\r\nfull of slaves. Yet five and twenty of the jury were brave enough to\r\nrisk their necks, preferring death to treachery: but there were\r\nthirty-one who were more influenced by famine than fame. Catulus meeting\r\none of these latter remarked to him: “Why did you ask for a guard? For\r\nfear of having your pocket picked?” There you have as short a summary as\r\npossible of the trial and the reason for the acquittal.\r\n\r\nYou want to know next what is the present state of public affairs, and\r\nhow I am getting on. We thought that the condition of the Republic had\r\nbeen set on a firm footing, you by my prudence, I by divine\r\ninterposition: and that its preservation was secured and established by\r\nthe combination of all patriots and by the influence of my consulship.\r\nBut, let me tell you, unless some god remembers us, it has been dashed\r\nfrom our grasp by this one trial, if one can call it a trial, when\r\nthirty of the\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Crassus; but why _ex Nanneianis_ is uncertain. Manutius says he bought\r\n  up the property of Nanneius, who was among those proscribed by Sulla,\r\n  and gave in his name as Licinius Calvus; but this is probably only a\r\n  guess.\r\n\r\nlevissimos ac nequissimos nummulis acceptis ius ac fas omne delere et,\r\nquod omnes non modo homines, verum etiam pecudes factum esse sciant, id\r\nTalnam et Plautum et Spongiam et ceteras huius modi quisquilias statuere\r\nnumquam esse factum. Sed tamen, ut te de re publica consoler, non ita,\r\nut sperarunt mali, tanto imposito rei publicae vulnere, alacris exsultat\r\nimprobitas in victoria. Nam plane ita putaverunt, cum religio, cum\r\npudicitia, cum iudiciorum fides, cum senatus auctoritas concidisset,\r\nfore ut aperte victrix nequitia ac libido poenas ab optimo quoque\r\npeteret sui doloris, quem improbissimo cuique inusserat severitas\r\nconsulatus mei. Idem ego ille (non enim mihi videor insolenter gloriari,\r\ncum de me apud te loquor, in ea praesertim epistula, quam nolo aliis\r\nlegi) idem, inquam, ego recreavi adflictos animos bonorum unum quemque\r\nconfirmans, excitans; insectandis vero exagitandisque nummariis\r\niudicibus omnem omnibus studiosis ac fautoribus illius victoriae\r\nπαρρησίαν eripui, Pisonem consulem nulla in re consistere umquam sum\r\npassus, desponsam homini iam Syriam ademi, senatum ad pristinam suam\r\nseveritatem revocavi atque abiectum excitavi, Clodium praesentem fregi\r\nin senatu cum oratione perpetua plenissima gravitatis tum altercatione\r\nhuius modi; ex qua licet pauca degustes; nam cetera non possunt habere\r\neandem neque vim neque venustatem remoto illo studio contentionis, quem\r\nἀγῶνα vos appellatis. Nam, ut Idibus Maiis in senatum convenimus,\r\nrogatus ego sententiam multa dixi de summa re publica, atque\r\n\r\nmost worthless scoundrels in Rome have blotted out right and justice for\r\nfilthy lucre, and when Hodge and John a Nokes and Tom a Styles and all\r\nthe riff-raff of that description have declared a thing not to have\r\nhappened which every man—man did I say?—nay, every beast of the field,\r\nknows for a fact. Still—to give you some consolation about politics—the\r\ncountry has not received so serious a blow as traitors wished, nor is\r\niniquity vaunting itself so rampantly on its victory. For they clearly\r\nthought that, when religious and moral scruples, judicial honour and the\r\nSenate’s authority had been destroyed, iniquity and lust would triumph\r\nopenly, and would wreak their vengeance on all honest folk for the brand\r\nthat had been stamped on vice by my consulship. I was the man—I don’t\r\nthink I am boasting unduly in saying so to you privately, especially in\r\na letter which I would rather you didn’t read to anyone—I was the man\r\nwho revived the fainting courage of the patriots, encouraging and\r\ncheering them one by one. I attacked and routed that venal jury; and I\r\ndid not leave the victorious party and its supporters a word to say for\r\nthemselves. The consul Piso I did not leave an inch to stand on. Syria,\r\nwhich had been promised him as his province, I wrested from him. The\r\nSenate I aroused from its despondency, recalling it to its former\r\nuprightness. Clodius I bearded and crushed in the Senate with a set\r\nspeech full of dignity, and then with a cross-examination, of which I\r\nwill give you a taste. The rest would lose both its verve and its wit,\r\nwhen the fire of battle is out, and the tug-of-war, as you Greeks call\r\nit, past. When I entered the House on the 15th of May, and was asked for\r\nmy opinion, I discussed politics at length, and by a\r\n\r\nille locus inductus a me est divinitus, ne una plaga accepta patres\r\nconscripti conciderent, ne deficerent; vulnus esse eius modi, quod mihi\r\nnec dissimulandum nec pertimescendum videretur, ne aut ignorando\r\nstultissimi aut metuendo ignavissimi iudicaremur; bis absolutum esse\r\nLentulum, bis Catilinam, hunc tertium iam esse a iudicibus in rem\r\npublicam immissum. “Erras, Clodi; non te iudices urbi, sed carceri\r\nreservarunt, neque te retinere in civitate, sed exsilio privare\r\nvoluerunt. Quam ob rem, patres conscripti, erigite animos, retinete\r\nvestram dignitatem. Manet illa in re publica bonorum consensio; dolor\r\naccessit bonis viris, virtus non est imminuta; nihil est damni factum\r\nnovi, sed, quod erat, inventum est. In unius hominis perditi iudicio\r\nplures similes reperti sunt.” Sed quid ago? paene orationem in epistulam\r\ninclusi. Redeo ad altercationem. Surgit pulchellus puer, obicit mihi me\r\nad Baias fuisse. Falsum, sed tamen quid hoc? “Simile est,” inquam,\r\n“quasi in operto dicas fuisse.” “Quid,” inquit, “homini Arpinati cum\r\naquis calidis?” “Narra,” inquam, “patrono tuo, qui Arpinatis aquas\r\nconcupivit”; nosti enim Marinas.[23] “Quousque,” inquit, “hunc regem\r\nferemus?” “Regem appellas,” inquam, “cum Rex tui mentionem nullam\r\nfecerit?”; ille autem Regis hereditatem spe\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Marianas _Rom. and many editors_.\r\n\r\nhappy inspiration introduced this passage: “The Senate must not be\r\ncrushed by a single blow, they must not be faint-hearted. The wound is\r\nsuch that it cannot be disguised, yet it must not be feared, lest by our\r\nfear we prove ourselves abject cowards, or by ignoring it, very fools.\r\nLentulus twice obtained an acquittal, and Catiline as often, and this is\r\nthe third criminal let loose on the country by a jury. But you are\r\nmistaken, Clodius. The jury saved you for the gallows, not for public\r\nlife: their object was not to keep you in the country, but to keep you\r\nfrom leaving it. Keep up your hearts, then, senators, and preserve your\r\ndignity. The feelings of all patriots are unchanged; they have suffered\r\ngrief, but their courage is undiminished. It is no new disaster that has\r\nbefallen us, we have merely discovered one that existed unnoticed. The\r\ntrial of one villain has revealed many as guilty as himself.” But there,\r\nI’ve nearly copied the whole speech. Now for our passage of arms. Up\r\ngets this pretty boy and reproaches me with spending my time at Baiae.\r\nIt was a lie: and anyhow what did it matter? “One would think,” said I,\r\n“you were accusing me of spending my time in hiding.” “What need has a\r\nman of Arpinum to take the waters?” asks Clodius: and I answered: “You\r\nshould talk like that to your patron[24] who wanted to take the waters\r\nof a man of Arpinum,”—you know about the sea-water baths. “How long are\r\nwe going to let this man king it over us?” says he. “I wonder you\r\nmention the word king,” I replied, “since King[25] did not mention you.”\r\nHe had\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  C. Scribonius Curio the elder, who bought the villa of Marius at Baiae\r\n  in the Sullan proscription.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Q. Marcius Rex, brother-in-law to Clodius.\r\n\r\ndevorarat. “Domum,” inquit, “emisti.” “Putes,” inquam, “dicere: Iudices\r\nemisti.” “Iuranti,” inquit, “tibi non crediderunt.” “Mihi vero,” inquam,\r\n“XXV indices crediderunt, XXXI, quoniam nummos ante acceperunt, tibi\r\nnihil crediderunt.” Magnis clamoribus adflictus conticuit et concidit.\r\n\r\nNoster autem status est hic. Apud bonos iidem sumus, quos reliquisti,\r\napud sordem urbis et faecem multo melius nunc, quam reliquisti. Nam et\r\nillud nobis non obest, videri nostrum testimonium non valuisse; missus\r\nest sanguis invidiae sine dolore atque etiam hoc magis, quod omnes illi\r\nfautores illius flagitii rem manifestam illam redemptam esse a iudicibus\r\nconfitentur. Accedit illud, quod illa contionalis hirudo aerarii, misera\r\nac ieiuna plebecula, me ab hoc Magno unice diligi putat, et hercule\r\nmulta et iucunda consuetudine coniuncti inter nos sumus usque eo, ut\r\nnostri isti comissatores coniurationis barbatuli iuvenes illum in\r\nsermonibus “Cn. Ciceronem” appellent. Itaque et ludis et gladiatoribus\r\nmirandas ἐπισημασίας sine ulla pastoricia fistula auferebamus.\r\n\r\nNunc est exspectatio comitiorum; in quae omnibus invitis trudit noster\r\nMagnus Auli filium atque in eo neque auctoritate neque gratia pugnat,\r\nsed quibus Philippus omnia castella expugnari posse dicebat, in quae\r\nmodo asellus onustus auro posset ascendere. Consul autem ille deterioris\r\nhistrionis similis suscepisse\r\n\r\nbeen dying to inherit Kind’s money. “You have bought a house,” he says.\r\n“You seem to think it is the same as buying a jury,” I answer. “They did\r\nnot credit you on your oath,” he remarks. To which I answer:\r\n“Twenty-five jurymen credited me: the other thirty-one gave you no\r\ncredit, but took care to get their money first.” There was loud\r\napplause, and he collapsed without a word, utterly crushed.\r\n\r\nMy own position is this. I have retained the influence I had, when you\r\nleft, over the conservative party, and have gained much more influence\r\nover the sordid dregs of the populace than I had then. That my testimony\r\nwas not accepted does me no harm. My unpopularity has been tapped like a\r\ndropsy and painlessly reduced, and another thing has done me even more\r\ngood: the supporters of that crime confess that that open scandal was\r\ndue to bribery. Besides that blood-sucker of the treasury, the wretched\r\nand starveling mob, thinks I am a prime favourite with the “great man”\r\nPompey, and upon my soul we are upon terms of very pleasant intimacy—so\r\nmuch so indeed that these bottle-conspirators, these youths with budding\r\nbeards in common table-talk call him Gnaeus Cicero. So both at the games\r\nand at the gladiatorial shows, I have been the object of extraordinary\r\ndemonstrations without hisses or catcalls.\r\n\r\nNow every one is looking forward to the elections. Our “great” Pompey is\r\npushing Aulus’ son amidst general disapproval: and the means he is using\r\nare neither authority nor influence, but those which Philip said, would\r\nstorm any fort to which an ass laden with money could climb. Piso is\r\nsaid to be playing second fiddle to Pompey and to have bribery-agents\r\n\r\nnegotium dicitur et domi divisores habere; quod ego non credo. Sed\r\nsenatus consulta duo iam facta sunt odiosa, quod in consulem facta\r\nputantur, Catone et Domitio postulante, unum, ut apud magistratus\r\ninquiri liceret, alterum, cuius domi divisores habitarent, adversus rem\r\npublicam. Lurco autem tribunus pl., qui magistratum insimul cum[26] lege\r\nalia iniit, solutus est et Aelia et Fufia, ut legem de ambitu ferret,\r\nquam ille bono auspicio claudus homo promulgavit. Ita comitia in a. d.\r\nVI Kal. Sext. dilata sunt. Novi est in lege hoc, ut, qui nummos in tribu\r\npronuntiarit, si non dederit, impune sit, sin dederit, ut, quoad vivat,\r\nsingulis tribulibus HS CIↃ CIↃ CIↃ debeat. Dixi hanc legem P. Clodium\r\niam ante servasse; pronuntiare enim solitum esse et non dare. Sed heus\r\ntu! videsne consulatum illum nostrum, quem Curio antea ἀποθέωσιν\r\nvocabat, si hic factus erit, fabam[27] mimum futurum? Quare, ut opinor,\r\nφιλοσοφητέον, id\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  _Munro’s suggestion_ insimulatum _“impugned by” is perhaps the best of\r\n  the many suggested emendations._\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Fabam _or_ Famam mimum _Orelli_: fabae hilum _Hoffmann_: fabae midam\r\n  _Brooks_.\r\n\r\nin his house: but I don’t believe it. But two decrees have been passed\r\non the proposal of Cato and Domitius, which are unpopular because they\r\nare thought to be directed against the consul; one, making it lawful to\r\nsearch the house of any magistrate, and the other making it a\r\ntreasonable offence to have bribery agents in one’s house. The tribune\r\nLurco, who entered on his office under another law,[28] has been freed\r\nfrom the obligations of the Aelian and Fufian laws, so that he may\r\npropose his law about bribery. He had luck in publishing it in spite of\r\nhis deformity. Accordingly the elections have been postponed till the\r\n27th of July. The new point about this law is that a mere promise to\r\nbribe the tribesmen counts for nothing, if it is not fulfilled; but, if\r\nit is fulfilled, the man who made it is liable for life to a fine of\r\n£27[29] per tribe. I remarked Clodius had kept this law before it was\r\npassed: for he is always promising and not paying. But, I say, if he[30]\r\ngets in, that consulship of mine which Curio used to call a deification\r\nwill become an absolute farce.[31] So, I suppose I must take to\r\nphilosophy\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Lurco’s proposal was irregular because it was made between the notice\r\n  of the elections and the elections themselves, which was forbidden by\r\n  the _leges Aelia et Fufia_ (153 B.C.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  3,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Afranius.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Supposed to allude to the election of a king by boys at the\r\n  Saturnalia, using beans to vote with; but it is rather dubious Latin.\r\n  In Seneca’s _Apocolocyntosis_ 9 the same proverbs seem to be referred\r\n  to in the phrase “_olim” inquit “magna res erat deum fieri: iam famam\r\n  mimum fecisti_”: whence it has been suggested that _Faba_ or _Fama_\r\n  was the name of some well-known farce.

But I cannot blame your determination, especially as I have refused\r\nto go to a province.\r\n\r\nI shall be contented with the inscriptions you have put in your\r\nAmaltheum, especially as Thyillus has deserted me and Archias has not\r\nwritten anything about me. I am afraid, now he has written his Greek\r\npoem on the Luculli, he is turning to the Caecilian drama. I have\r\nthanked Antonius on your behalf, and given that letter to Mallius. My\r\nletters to you up to now have been fewer than they should have been, as\r\nI had no trusty messenger nor any certain address to send them to. I\r\nhave sung your praises loudly. If Cincius delegates any of your business\r\nto me, I will undertake it. But just at present he is more concerned\r\nwith his own, in which I am ready to assist him.

I am exceedingly disturbed\r\n\r\nadfectus, quantam mihi meus amor summus erga utrumque vestrum adferre\r\ndebuit, et admiratione, quidnam accidisset, quod adferret Quinto fratri\r\nmeo aut offensionem tam gravem aut commutationem tantam voluntatis.\r\nAtque illud a me iam ante intellegebatur, quod te quoque ipsum\r\ndiscedentem a nobis suspicari videbam, subesse nescio quid opinionis\r\nincommodae sauciumque esse eius animum et insedisse quasdam odiosas\r\nsuspiciones. Quibus ego mederi cum cuperem antea saepe et vehementius\r\netiam post sortitionem provinciae, nec tantum intellegebam ei esse\r\noffensionis, quantum litterae tuae declararant, nec tantum proficiebam,\r\nquantum volebam. Sed tamen hoc me ipse consolabar, quod non dubitabam,\r\nquin te ille aut Dyrrachi aut in istis locis uspiam visurus esset; quod\r\ncum accidisset, confidebam ac mihi persuaseram fore ut omnia placarentur\r\ninter vos non modo sermone ac disputatione, sed conspectu ipso\r\ncongressuque vestro. Nam quanta sit in Quinto fratre meo comitas, quanta\r\niucunditas, quam mollis animus et ad accipiendam et ad deponendam\r\noffensionem, nihil attinet me ad te, qui ea nosti, scribere. Sed accidit\r\nperincommode, quod eum nusquam vidisti. Valuit enim plus, quod erat illi\r\nnon nullorum artificiis inculcatum, quam aut officium aut necessitudo\r\naut amor vester ille pristinus, qui plurimum valere debuit. Atque huius\r\nincommodi culpa ubi resideat, facilius possum existimare quam scribere;\r\nvereor enim, ne, dum defendam meos, non parcam tuis. Nam sic intellego,\r\nut nihil a domesticis\r\n\r\nabout it, as indeed I could not help being, considering my affection for\r\nboth of you, and I wonder what can have happened to cause my brother\r\nQuintus such grave offence and to make him change his mind so\r\nextraordinarily. I grasped some time ago, what I think you were\r\nbeginning to suspect, when you left, that at the bottom of it must be\r\nsome idea of an insult, and that his feelings were wounded and some\r\nunpleasant suspicions had taken deep root. Though I often before sought\r\nto heal the wound, and redoubled my efforts after the allotment of his\r\nprovince, I could neither find that he was as much annoyed as your\r\nletter makes out, nor yet make as much headway with him as I wished.\r\nHowever, I used to console myself with the thought that he would be sure\r\nto see you either at Dyrrachium or somewhere thereabout. And I had quite\r\nmade up my mind that when that occurred, all the difficulties between\r\nyou would be smoothed over as much by the mere sight of one another and\r\nthe pleasure of meeting as by conversation and discussion. For I need\r\nnot tell you, who know it yourself, how amiable and kindly my brother\r\nQuintus is, and how sensitive he is and ready both to take offence and\r\nto forget it. But it has happened most unfortunately that you have not\r\nseen him anywhere. For the impression he has received from some\r\ndesigning persons has had more weight with him than either his duty or\r\nyour old intimacy and affection which ought to have had the greatest\r\nweight of all. Where the blame for this unpleasantness rests, it is\r\neasier for me to imagine than to write. For I am afraid that in\r\ndefending my relatives I may not spare yours. For my view is that, even\r\nif no wound was inflicted\r\n\r\nvulneris factum sit, illud quidem, quod erat, eos certe sanare potuisse.\r\nSed huiusce rei totius vitium, quod aliquanto etiam latius patet, quam\r\nvidetur, praesenti tibi commodius exponam. De iis litteris; quas ad te\r\nThessalonica misit, et de sermonibus, quos ab illo et Romae apud amicos\r\ntuos et in itinere habitos putas, ecquid tantum causae sit, ignore, sed\r\nomnis in tua posita est humanitate mihi spes huius levandae molestiae.\r\nNam, si ita statueris, et irritabiles animus esse optimorum saepe\r\nhominum et eosdem placabiles et esse hanc agilitatem, ut ita dicam,\r\nmollitiamque naturae plerumque bonitatis et, id quod caput est, nobis\r\ninter nos nostra sive incommoda sive vitia sive iniurias esse\r\ntolerandas, facile haec, quem ad modum spero, mitigabuntur; quod ego ut\r\nfacias te oro. Nam ad me, qui te unice diligo, maxime pertinet neminem\r\nesse meorum, qui aut te non amet aut abs te non ametur.\r\n\r\nIlla pars epistulae tuae minime fuit necessaria, in qua exponis, quas\r\nfacilitates aut provincialium aut urbanorum commodorum et aliis\r\ntemporibus et me ipso consule praetermiseris. Mihi enim perspecta est et\r\ningenuitas et magnitudo animi tui; neque ego inter me atque te quicquam\r\ninteresse umquam duxi praeter voluntatem institutae vitae, quod me\r\nambitio quaedam ad honorum studium, te autem alia minime reprehendenda\r\nratio ad honestum otium duxit. Vera quidem laude probitatis,\r\ndiligentiae, religionis neque me tibi neque quemquam antepono, amoris\r\nvero erga\r\n\r\nby members of the family, they could certainly have healed the one which\r\nexisted. But the real fault of the whole matter, which is of rather\r\nwider extent than it appears, I can explain to you more conveniently\r\nwhen we meet. As to the letter which he sent to you from Thessalonica\r\nand the language which you think he used about you both to your friends\r\nat Rome and on his journey, I cannot see any sufficient cause for them;\r\nbut all my hope of removing this unpleasantness lies in your kindness.\r\nFor if you can persuade yourself that the best of men are often those\r\nwhose feelings are easy to arouse and easy to appease, and that this\r\nnimbleness, if I may use the word, and sensitiveness of disposition are\r\ngenerally signs of a good heart, and—what is the main point—that we must\r\nput up with one another’s unpleasantnesses and faults and insults, then,\r\nas I hope, all this can be smoothed over easily. This I beg of you to\r\ndo. For, as I hold you in such peculiar esteem, it is my dearest wish\r\nthat there may not be any of my people who either does not love you or\r\nis not loved by you.\r\n\r\nThat part of your letter in which you mention the chances of preferment\r\nin the provinces or in town, which you neglected in my consulship and at\r\nother times, was most unnecessary, for I am thoroughly persuaded of your\r\ndisinterestedness and magnanimity, and I have never thought that there\r\nwas any difference between you and me, except our choice of a career. A\r\ntouch of ambition led me to seek for distinction, while another\r\nperfectly laudable motive led you to honourable ease. But in the real\r\nglory which consists in uprightness, industry and piety, there is no one\r\nI place above you, not even myself, and as\r\n\r\nme, cum a fraterno amore domesticoque discessi, tibi primas defero. Vidi\r\nenim, vidi penitusque perspexi in meis variis temporibus et\r\nsollicitudines et laetitias tuas. Fuit mihi saepe et laudis nostrae\r\ngratulatio tua iucunda et timoris consolatio grata. Quin mihi nunc te\r\nabsente non solum consilium, quo tu excellis, sed etiam sermonis\r\ncommunicatio, quae mihi suavissima tecum solet esse, maxime deest—quid\r\ndicam? in publicane re, quo in genere mihi neglegenti esse non licet, an\r\nin forensi labore, quem antea propter ambitionem sustinebam, nunc, ut\r\ndignitatem tueri gratia possim, an in ipsis domesticis negotiis, in\r\nquibus ego cum antea tum vero post discessum fratris te sermonesque\r\nnostros desidero? Postremo non labor meus, non requies, non negotium,\r\nnon otium, non forenses res, non domesticae, non publicae, non privatae\r\ncarere diutius tuo suavissimo atque amantissimo consilio ac sermone\r\npossunt.\r\n\r\nAtque harum rerum commemorationem verecundia saepe impedivit utriusque\r\nnostrum; nunc autem ea fuit necessaria propter eam partem epistulae\r\ntuae, per quam te ac mores tuos mihi purgatos ac probatos esse voluisti.\r\nAtque in ista incommoditate alienati illius animi et offensi illud inest\r\ntamen commodi, quod et mihi et ceteris amicis tuis nota fuit et abs te\r\naliquanto ante testificata tua voluntas omittendae provinciae, ut, quod\r\nuna non estis, non dissensione ac discidio vestro, sed voluntate ac\r\niudicio tuo factum esse videatur. Quare et illa, quae violata,\r\nexpiabuntur,\r\n\r\nregards affection to myself, after my brother and my immediate\r\nconnections, I give you the palm. For I have seen time after time, and\r\nhave had thorough experience of your sorrow and your joy in my changing\r\nfortunes. I have often had the pleasure of your congratulations in times\r\nof triumph and the comfort of your consolation in hours of despondency.\r\nNay at this very moment your absence makes me feel the lack not only of\r\nyour advice, which you excel in giving, but of the interchange of\r\nspeech, which I enjoy most with you. I hardly know if I miss it most in\r\npolitics, where I dare not make a slip; or in my legal work, which I\r\nused to undertake for advancement’s sake and now keep up to preserve my\r\nposition through popularity; or in my private concerns. In all of them I\r\nhave felt your loss all along and especially since my brother’s\r\ndeparture. Finally, neither my work nor my recreation, neither my\r\nbusiness nor my leisure, neither my legal affairs nor my domestic, my\r\npublic life or my private, can do without your most agreeable and\r\naffectionate advice and conversation any longer.\r\n\r\nThe modesty of both of us has often prevented me from mentioning these\r\nfacts: but now it was forced upon me by that part of your letter in\r\nwhich you say you want yourself and your character cleared and\r\nvindicated in my eyes. There is one good thing as regards the\r\nunpleasantness caused by his alienation and anger, that your\r\ndetermination not to go to the province was known to me and other\r\nfriends of yours, as you told us some time before; so the fact that you\r\nare not with him cannot be attributed to your quarrel and rupture, but\r\nto your choice and plans already fixed. So amends will be made for\r\n\r\net haec nostra, quae sunt sanctissime conservata, suam religionem\r\nobtinebunt.\r\n\r\nNos hic in re publica infirma, misera commutabilique versamur. Credo\r\nenim te audisse nostros equites paene a senatu esse diiunctos; qui\r\nprimum illud valde graviter tulerunt, promulgatum ex senatus consulto\r\nfuisse, ut de eis, qui ob iudicandum accepissent, quaereretur. Qua in re\r\ndecernenda cum ego casu non adfuissem, sensissemque id equestrem ordinem\r\nferre moleste neque aperte dicere, obiurgavi senatum, ut mihi visus sum,\r\nsumma cum auctoritate, et in causa non verecunda admodum gravis et\r\ncopiosus fui. Ecce aliae deliciae equitum vix ferendae! quas ego non\r\nsolum tuli, sed etiam ornavi. Asiam qui de censoribus conduxerunt,\r\nquesti sunt in senatu se cupiditate prolapses nimium magno conduxisse,\r\nut induceretur locatio, postulaverunt. Ego princeps in adiutoribus atque\r\nadeo secundus; nam, ut illi auderent hos postulare, Crassus eos impulit.\r\nInvidiosa res, turpis postulatio et confessio temeritatis. Summum erat\r\npericulum, ne, si nihil impetrassent, plane alienarentur a senatu. Huic\r\nquoque rei subventum est maxime a nobis perfectunique, ut frequentissimo\r\nsenatu et libentissimo uterentur multaque a me de ordinum dignitate et\r\nconcordia dicta sunt Kal. Decembr. et postridie. Neque adhuc res\r\nconfecta est, sed voluntas senatus perspecta; unus enim contra dixerat\r\n\r\nthe breach of friendship; and the ties between us, which have been so\r\nreligiously preserved, will retain their inviolability.\r\n\r\nThe political position here is wretched, rotten and unstable. I expect\r\nyou have heard that our friends the knights have almost had a rupture\r\nwith the Senate. The first point that seriously annoyed them was the\r\npublication of a senatorial decree for an investigation into any cases\r\nof bribery of jurymen. As I did not happen to be present when the decree\r\nwas passed, and noticed that the knights were annoyed though they did\r\nnot openly say so, I remonstrated with the Senate very impressively, I\r\nthink, and spoke with great weight and fluency, considering how\r\nshameless the case was. Here is another intolerable piece of petulance\r\non the part of the knights! Yet I have not only put up with it, but\r\nforwarded their cause. The people who farmed the province of Asia from\r\nthe censors, complained in the Senate that their avariciousness had led\r\nthem to pay too high a price for it, and requested to have the lease\r\nannulled. I was their chief supporter, or rather the second, for it was\r\nCrassus who encouraged them to venture on the demand. It is a scandalous\r\naffair, a disgraceful request and a confession of foolhardiness. There\r\nwas considerable danger, that, if they met with a refusal, they might\r\nhave severed their connection with the Senate entirely. In this case too\r\nI was the main person who came to the rescue, and obtained for them a\r\nhearing in a very full and friendly House, and discoursed freely on the\r\ndignity and harmony of the two orders both on the first of December and\r\nthe following day. The matter is not yet settled: but the Senate’s\r\ninclination is clear. For one person\r\n\r\nMetellus consul designatus. Atqui erat[32] dicturus, ad quem propter\r\ndiei brevitatem perventum non est, heros ille noster Cato.

Our hero Cato was to\r\nhave spoken, but the day was too short for it to come to his turn. So I\r\nam keeping to our policy and plan, and am preserving to the best of my\r\nability that harmony which I have welded: but still, as that is now in\r\nsuch a shaky condition, I am, I hope, keeping a road open to preserve my\r\nposition. I cannot explain fully in a letter; but I will give you a\r\ngentle hint. I am on the best of terms with Pompey. You know what I\r\nmean. I will take all reasonable precautions, and will write again at\r\nfuller length as to my plans for managing the republic.\r\n\r\nLucceius is thinking of standing for the consulship at once: for only\r\ntwo candidates are spoken of as likely to come forward. With Caesar he\r\nthinks he may come to terms through Arrius, and Bibulus’ cooperation he\r\nhopes to win through C. Piso. You smile? There is nothing to laugh at, I\r\nassure you. Is there anything else I want to tell you? Anything else?\r\nYes, lots of things, but another time ... you wish to wait (?), let me\r\nknow. At present I have one modest request to make, though it is my\r\nchief desire: that you come as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n5 December.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jan. 20_, B.C. _60_]\r\n\r\nBelieve me, there is nothing I want so much at the present time, as a\r\nperson with whom I can share anything that causes me the least anxiety,\r\na man of affection and common sense, to whom I can speak without\r\naffectation, reserve, or concealment. My\r\n\r\nobtegam. Abest enim frater ἀφελέστατος et amantissimus. Metellus non\r\nhomo, sed\r\n\r\n                  “litus atque aer et solitudo mera.”\r\n\r\nTu autem, qui saepissime curam et angorem animi mei sermone et consilio\r\nlevasti tuo, qui mihi et in publica re socius et in privatis omnibus\r\nconscius et omnium meorum sermonum et consiliorum particeps esse soles,\r\nubinam es?

Metellus is not a human being, but “sea-shore and airy void and\r\ndesert waste.”[35] And you whose conversation and advice have so often\r\nlightened my load of care and anxiety, who have aided me in my political\r\nlife, been my confident in my family affairs and shared my conversations\r\nand projects—where are you? So utterly am I deserted, that the only\r\nmoments of repose I have are those which are spent with my wife, my\r\nlittle daughter and darling boy. For my grand and showy friendships\r\nbring some public _éclat_, but private satisfaction they have none. And\r\nso, when my house has been crowded with the morning _levée_ and I have\r\ngone down to the forum amid a throng of friends, I cannot find in the\r\nwhole company a single man with whom I can jest freely or whisper\r\nfamiliarly. So I look forward with longing to your coming and in fact\r\nurge you to hurry: for I have many cares and anxieties, which I fancy\r\nwould be banished by a single walk and talk in your sympathetic hearing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will conceal the stings and pricks of my private troubles,\r\nand will not entrust them to this letter and an unknown messenger. They\r\nare not very grievous—so don’t alarm yourself—but still they are\r\npersistent and worrying, and I have no friend’s advice and discussion to\r\nlull them to rest. For the State, though there is still life in it, the\r\nvery cures that have been tried on it, have again and again opened fresh\r\nwounds. If I were to give you a brief summary of what has happened since\r\nyou left, you would certainly exclaim that Rome cannot possibly stand\r\nany longer. For it was after your departure, I believe, that the opening\r\nscene of the\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Probably from Accius.\r\n\r\nut opinor, introitus fuit in causam fabulae Clodianae, in qua ego\r\nnactus, ut mihi videbar, locum resecandae libidinis et coercendae\r\niuventutis; vehemens fui et omnes profudi vires animi atque ingenii mei\r\nnon odio adductus alicuius, sed spe corrigendae et sanandae civitatis.\r\nAdflicta res publica est empto constupratoque iudicio. Vide, quae sint\r\npostea consecuta. Consul est impositus is nobis, quem nemo praeter nos\r\nphilosophos aspicere sine suspiritu posset. Quantum hoc vulnus! facto\r\nsenatus consulto de ambitu, de iudiciis nulla lex perlata, exagitatus\r\nsenatus, alienati equites Romani. Sic ille annus duo firmamenta rei\r\npublicae per me unum constituta evertit; nam et senatus auctoritatem\r\nabiecit et ordinum concordiam diiunxit. Instat hic nunc ille annus\r\negregius. Eius initium eius modi fuit, ut anniversaria sacra Iuventatis\r\nnon committerentur; nam M. Luculli uxorem Memmius suis sacris initiavit;\r\nMenelaus aegre id passus divortium fecit. Quamquam ille pastor Idaeus\r\nMenelaum solum contempserat, hic noster Paris tam Menelaum quam\r\nAgamemnonem liberum non putavit. Est autem C. Herennius quidam tribunus\r\npl., quem tu fortasse ne nosti quidem; tametsi potes nosse, tribulis\r\nenim tuus est, et Sextus, pater eius, nummos vobis dividere solebat. Is\r\nad plebem P. Clodium traducit, idemque fert, ut universus populus in\r\ncampo Martio suffragium de re Clodi ferat. Hunc\r\n\r\nClodian drama became the topic of discussion. There I thought I had a\r\nchance of using the surgeon’s knife on licentiousness and curbing\r\nyouthful excesses: and I exerted myself, putting forth all the resources\r\nof my intellect and mind, not out of private spite, but in the hope of\r\neffecting a radical cure of the State. The corruption of the jury by\r\nbribery and debauchery dealt a crushing blow to the republic. See what\r\nhas followed. We have had a consul forced on us, at whom no one except\r\nus philosophers can look without a sigh. That is a fatal stroke. Though\r\na senatorial decree has been passed about the bribery of juries, no law\r\nhas been carried; the Senate has been frightened out of it, and the\r\nknights have been estranged. So this one year has overturned two\r\nbulwarks of the State which had been erected by me alone: for it has\r\ndestroyed the prestige of the Senate and broken up the harmony of the\r\norders. Now comes this precious year. It was inaugurated by the\r\nsuspension of the annual rites of the goddess of youth: for Memmius\r\ninitiated M. Lucullus’ wife into some rites of his own. Menelaus took it\r\nhard and divorced his wife. Unlike the shepherd of Ida, who only\r\nslighted Menelaus, our modern Paris thought Agamemnon[36] as fitting an\r\nobject for his contempt. There is one C. Herennius, a tribune—you may\r\nnot even know him, though perhaps you do, as he is a member of the same\r\ntribe as yourself, and his father Sextus used to distribute money to\r\nyour tribesmen—he is trying to transfer P. Clodius to the plebs, and\r\neven proposes that the whole people shall vote on the matter in the\r\nCampus Martius. I gave him my\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  L. Lucullus, whose claim to a triumph Memmius opposed as tribune in\r\n  66–65 B.C.\r\n\r\nego accepi in senatu, ut soleo, sed nihil est illo homine lentius.\r\nMetellus est consul egregius et nos amat, sed imminuit auctoritatem\r\nsuam, quod habet dicis causa promulgatum illud idem de Clodio. Auli\r\nautem filius, o di immortales! quam ignavus ac sine animo miles! quam\r\ndignus, qui Palicano, sicut facit, os ad male audiendum cotidie\r\npraebeat! Agraria autem promulgata est a Flavio sane levis eadem fere,\r\nquae fuit Plotia. Sed interea πολιτικὸς ἀνὴρ οὐδ’ ὄναρ quisquam inveniri\r\npotest; qui poterat, familiaris noster (sic est enim; volo te hoc scire)\r\nPompeius togulam illam pictam silentio tuetur suam. Crassus verbum\r\nnullum contra gratiam. Ceteros iam nosti; qui ita sunt stulti, ut amissa\r\nre publica piscinas suas fore salvas sperare videantur. Unus est, qui\r\ncuret constantia magis et integritate quam, ut mihi videtur, consilio\r\naut ingenio, Cato; qui miseros publicanos, quos habuit amantissimos sui,\r\ntertium iam mensem vexat neque iis a senatu responsum dari patitur. Ita\r\nnos cogimur reliquis de rebus nihil decernere, antequam publicanis\r\nresponsum sit. Quare etiam legationes reiectum iri puto.\r\n\r\nNunc vides quibus fluctibus iactemur, et, si ex iis, quae scripsimus\r\ntanta, etiam a me non scripta perspicis, revise nos aliquando et,\r\nquamquam sunt haec\r\n\r\nusual reception in the Senate; but he is the most phlegmatic of mortals.\r\nMetellus is an excellent consul and an admirer of mine; but he has\r\nlessened his influence by making, only for form’s sake, the very same\r\nproposal about Clodius. But Aulus’ son—heavens above! what a cowardly\r\nand spiritless wretch for a soldier! Just fit to be exposed, as he is,\r\nto the daily abuse of Palicanus. An agrarian law has been proposed by\r\nFlavius,—a very paltry production, almost identical with the Plotian\r\nlaw. And in the meantime not the ghost of a real statesman is to be\r\nfound. The man who could be one, my intimate friend—for so he is, I\r\nwould have you to know—Pompey, wraps that precious triumphal cloak of\r\nhis around him in silence. Crassus never utters a word to risk his\r\npopularity. The others you know well enough—fools who seem to hope that\r\ntheir fish-ponds may be saved, though the country go to rack and ruin.\r\nThere is one who can be said to take some pains, but, according to my\r\nview, with more constancy and honesty than judgement and ability—Cato.\r\nIt is now three months that he has been worrying those wretched\r\ntax-collectors, who used to be great friends of his, and won’t let the\r\nSenate give them an answer. So we are forced to suspend all decrees on\r\nother subjects until the tax-collectors have had an answer. And I\r\nsuppose even the embassies[37] will have to be postponed for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nNow you see the storm we have to weather; and, as you can grasp from\r\nwhat I have written with such emphasis, something of what I have left\r\nunwritten, come and see me again, for it is high time. Though\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Foreign embassies were received in February.\r\n\r\nfugienda, quo te voco, tamen fac ut amorem nostrum tanti aestimes, ut eo\r\nvel cum his molestiis perfrui velis.

But on the top of my\r\ninconceivable stress of work, you have to add my habit of never sending\r\nyou a letter without a theme and a moral. First, as one ought to a loyal\r\ncitizen, I will give you a sketch of political events, and then, as I am\r\nthe nearest in your affection, I will tell you any of my own affairs\r\nthat I think you would not be disinclined to know.\r\n\r\nIn politics then at the present minute fears of war in Gaul are the main\r\ntopic: for “our brothers” the Aedui have had a disastrous battle\r\nrecently, and the Helvetii are undoubtedly in arms and making raids on\r\nour province. The Senate has decreed that the consuls should cast lots\r\nfor the two Gauls, that levies should be made, furloughs cancelled, and\r\nambassadors with full powers sent to visit the Gallic states and prevent\r\nthem from joining the Aedui. The ambassadors are Quintus Metellus\r\nCreticus, and Lucius Flaccus, and—“the caper sauce on\r\n\r\nClodiani filius. Atque hoc loco illud non queo praeterire, quod, cum de\r\nconsularibus mea prima sors exisset, una voce senatus frequens\r\nretinendum me in urbe censuit. Hoc idem post me Pompeio accidit, ut nos\r\nduo quasi pignora rei publicae retineri videremur. Quid enim ego aliorum\r\nin me ἐπιφωνήματα exspectem, cum haec domi nascantur?\r\n\r\nUrbanae autem res sic se habent. Agraria lex a Flavio tribuno pl.\r\nvehementer agitabatur auctore Pompeio; quae nihil populare habebat\r\npraeter auctorem.

Huic toti\r\nrationi agrariae senatus adversabatur suspicans Pompeio novam quandam\r\npotentiam quaeri; Pompeius vero ad voluntatem perferendae legis\r\nincubuerat. Ego autem magna cum agrariorum gratia confirmabam omnium\r\nprivatorum\r\n\r\nlenten fare”[40]—Lentulus, son of Clodianus. And I cannot forbear adding\r\nhere that when my lot came up first in the ballot among the ex-consuls,\r\nthe Senate were unanimous in declaring that I should be kept in Rome.\r\nThe same happened to Pompey after me, so that we two appear to be kept\r\nas pledges of the State. Why should I look for the “bravos” of strangers\r\nwhen these triumphs bloom for me at home?\r\n\r\nWell, this is the state of affairs in the city. The agrarian law was\r\nzealously pushed by the tribune Flavius with the support of Pompey,\r\nthough its only claim to popularity was its supporter. My proposal to\r\nremove from the law any points which encroached on private rights was\r\nfavourably received by a public meeting. I proposed to exempt from its\r\naction such land as was public in the consulship of P. Mucius and L.\r\nCalpurnius,[41] to confirm Sulla’s veterans in their possessions, to\r\nallow the people of Volaterra and Arretium to retain in their holding\r\ntheir land which Sulla had made public land, but had not distributed:\r\nthe only clause I did not reject was that land should be purchased by\r\nthis wind-fall which will come in from the new foreign revenues in the\r\nnext five years. The Senate was opposed to the whole agrarian scheme,\r\nsuspecting that Pompey was aiming at getting some new powers. Pompey had\r\nset his heart on carrying the law through. I on the other hand, with the\r\nfull approval of the applicants for land, was for securing the holdings\r\nof all private\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Lit. “myrrh oil on lentils”; referring to a line in the _Phoenissae_\r\n  of Strattis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  133 B.C., the year before the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus.\r\n\r\npossessiones; is enim est noster exercitus, hominum, ut tute scis,\r\nlocupletium; populo autem et Pompeio (nam id quoque volebam) satis\r\nfaciebam emptione, qua constituta diligenter et sentinam urbis exhauriri\r\net Italiae solitudinem frequentari posse arbitrabar. Sed haec tota res\r\ninterpellata bello refrixerat. Metellus est consul sane bonus et nos\r\nadmodum diligit; ille alter nihil ita est, ut plane, quid emerit,\r\nnesciat. Haec sunt in re publica, nisi etiam illud ad rem publicam putas\r\npertinere, Herennium quendam, tribunum pl., tribulem tuum sane hominem\r\nnequam atque egentem, saepe iam de P. Clodio ad plebem traducendo agere\r\ncoepisse. Huic frequenter interceditur. Haec sunt, ut opinor, in re\r\npublica.\r\n\r\nEgo autem, ut semel Nonarum illarum Decembrium iunctam invidia ac\r\nmultorum inimicitiis eximiam quandam atque immortalem gloriam consecutus\r\nsum, non destiti eadem animi magnitudine in re publica versari et illam\r\ninstitutam ac susceptam dignitatem tueri, sed, posteaquam primum Clodi\r\nabsolutione levitatem infirmitatemque iudiciorum perspexi, deinde vidi\r\nnostros publicanos facile a senatu diiungi, quamquam a me ipso non\r\ndivellerentur, tum autem beatos homines, hos piscinarios dico amicos\r\ntuos, non obscure nobis invidere, putavi mihi maiores quasdam opes et\r\nfirmiora praesidia esse quaerenda. Itaque primum, eum qui nimium diu de\r\nrebus nostris tacuerat. Pompeium\r\n\r\npersons—for, as you know, the strength of our party consists in the rich\r\nlanded gentry—while at the same time I fulfilled my desire to satisfy\r\nPompey and the populace by supporting the purchase of land, thinking\r\nthat, if that were thoroughly carried out, the city might be emptied of\r\nthe dregs of the populace, and the deserted parts of Italy peopled. But\r\nthe matter has cooled off now this war has interrupted it. Metellus is\r\nan excellent consul and a great admirer of mine. The other one is an\r\nutter nonentity and clearly bought a pig in a poke when he got the\r\nconsulship. That is all my political news, unless you think this has a\r\nbearing on politics. One Herennius, a tribune and fellow tribesman of\r\nyours, and a man of no character or position, has begun frequently\r\nproposing the transference of P. Clodius from a patrician to a plebeian;\r\nand his proposals are vetoed by many of his colleagues. This, I think,\r\nis all the public news.\r\n\r\nFor myself, ever since that December day when I won such splendid and\r\nimmortal glory, though it carried with it much envy and enmity, I have\r\nnot ceased to employ the same high-minded policy and to keep the\r\nposition I have won and taken up. But, as soon as the acquittal of\r\nClodius showed me the uncertainty and instability of the law courts, and\r\nI saw too how easily our friends the tax-gatherers could be estranged\r\nfrom the Senate, though they might not sever their connection with me,\r\nwhile the well-to-do—your friends with the fish-ponds, I mean—took no\r\npains to disguise their envy of me, I bethought me that I had better\r\nlook out for some stronger support and more secure protection. So\r\nfirstly I brought Pompey, the man who had held his peace too long about\r\n\r\nadduxi in eam voluntatem, ut in senatu non semel, sed saepe multisque\r\nverbis huius mihi salutem imperii atque orbis terrarum adiudicarit; quod\r\nnon tam interfuit mea (neque enim illae res aut ita sunt obscurae, ut\r\ntestimonium, aut ita dubiae, ut laudationem desiderent) quam rei\r\npublicae, quod erant quidam improbi, qui contentionem fore aliquam mihi\r\ncum Pompeio ex rerum illarum dissensione arbitrarentur. Cum hoc ego me\r\ntanta familiaritate coniunxi, ut uterque nostrum in sua ratione munitior\r\net in re publica firmior hac coniunctione esse possit. Odia autem illa\r\nlibidinosae et delicatae iuventutis, quae erant in me incitata, sic\r\nmitigata sunt comitate quadam mea, me unum ut omnes illi colant; nihil\r\niam denique a me asperum in quemquam fit nec tamen quicquam populare ac\r\ndissolutum, sed ita temperata tota ratio est, ut rei publicae\r\nconstantiam praestem, privatis meis rebus propter infirmitatem bonorum,\r\niniquitatem malevolorum, odium in me improborum adhibeam quandam\r\ncautionem et diligentiam atque ita, tametsi his novis amicitiis\r\nimplicati sumus, ut crebro mihi vafer ille Siculus insusurret Epicharmus\r\ncantilenam illam suam:\r\n\r\n           Νᾶφε καὶ μέμνασ’ ἀπιστεῖν· ἄρθρα ταῦτα τᾶν φρενῶν.\r\n\r\nAc nostrae quidem rationis ac vitae quasi quandam formam, ut opinor,\r\nvides.\r\n\r\nDe tuo autem negotio saepe ad me scribis. Cui mederi nunc non possumus;\r\nest enim illud senatus\r\n\r\nmy achievements, into a frame of mind for attributing to me the\r\nsalvation of the empire and the world not once only, but time after time\r\nand with emphasis in the House. That was not so much for my own\r\nbenefit—for my achievements were neither so obscure that they required\r\nevidence, nor so dubious that they required puffing up—but for the\r\nState’s sake, for there were some ill-natured persons who thought that\r\nthere was a certain amount of disagreement between Pompey and myself,\r\nowing to a difference of opinion about those matters. With him I have\r\nformed such an intimate connection that both of us are strengthened in\r\nour policy and surer in our political position through our coalition.\r\nThe dislike which had been aroused against me among our dissipated and\r\ndandified youths has been smoothed away by my affability, and now they\r\npay me more attention than anyone. In short I avoid hurting anyone’s\r\nfeelings, though I do not court popularity by relaxing my principles;\r\nindeed my whole conduct is regulated so, that, while I preserve my\r\nfirmness in public life, in my private affairs the weakness of the loyal\r\nparty, the prejudice of the disaffected and the hostility of the\r\ndisloyal makes me move with some care and caution, and, involved though\r\nI am in my new friendships, I frequently have the refrain of Epicharmus,\r\nthat subtle Sicilian, ringing in my ears:\r\n\r\n             Be sober of head, and mistrustful of friends;\r\n             Hinges are these on which wisdom depends.\r\n\r\nThere you have, I think, an outline sketch of my rule of life.\r\n\r\nYou keep writing about that business of yours; but at present I have no\r\nremedy for it. The decree\r\n\r\nconsultum summa pedariorum voluntate nullius nostrum auctoritate factum.\r\nNam, quod me esse ad scribendum vides, ex ipso senatus consulto\r\nintellegere potes aliam rem tum relatam, hoc autem de populis liberis\r\nsine causa additum. Et ita factum est a P. Servilio filio, qui in\r\npostremis sententiam dixit, sed immutari hoc tempore non potest. Itaque\r\nconventus, qui initio celebrabantur, iam diu fieri desierunt. Tu si tuis\r\nblanditiis tamen a Sicyoniis nummulorum aliquid expresseris, velim me\r\nfacias certiorem.\r\n\r\nCommentarium consulatus mei Graece compositum misi ad te. In quo si quid\r\nerit, quod homini Attico minus Graecum eruditumque videatur, non dicam,\r\nquod tibi, ut opinor, Panhormi Lucullus de suis historiis dixerat, se,\r\nquo facilius illas probaret Romani hominis esse, idcirco barbara quaedam\r\net σόλοικα dispersisse; apud me si quid erit eius modi, me imprudente\r\nerit et invito. Latinum si perfecero, ad te mittam. Tertium poema\r\nexspectato, ne quod genus a me ipso laudis meae praetermittatur. Hic tu\r\ncave dicas: Τίς πατέρ’ αἰνήσει; Si est enim apud homines quicquam quod\r\npotius sit, laudetur, nos vituperemur, qui non potius alia laudemus;\r\nquamquam non ἐγκωμιαστικὰ sunt haec, sed ἱστορικά, quae scribimus.\r\n\r\nQuintus frater purgat se mihi per litteras et adfirmat nihil a se\r\ncuiquam de te secus esse dictum.\r\n\r\nwas passed by the enthusiasm of the silent members[42] without any\r\nsupport from our party. For as to my signature which you find attached\r\nto it, you can see from the decree itself that it was quite a different\r\nmatter which was brought forward, and this clause about the free peoples\r\nwas added without rhyme or reason. It was the work of P. Servilius the\r\nyounger, who was one of the last to speak: but it cannot be altered at\r\nthe present time. So the meetings which at first were held about it have\r\nceased long ago. If, however, you should manage to squeeze a few pence\r\nout of the Sicyonians, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI have sent you a copy of my account of my consulship in Greek. If there\r\nis anything in it, which to your Attic taste seems bad Greek or\r\nunscholarly, I will not say what Lucullus said to you—at Panhormus, I\r\nthink—about his history, that he had interspersed a few barbarisms and\r\nsolecisms as a clear proof that it was the work of a Roman. If there is\r\nanything of the kind in my work, it is there without my knowledge and\r\nagainst my will. When I have finished the Latin version, I will send it\r\nto you. In the third place you may expect a poem, not to let slip any\r\nmethod of singing my own praises. Please don’t quote “Who will praise\r\nhis sire?”[43] For if there is any more fitting subject for eulogy, then\r\nI am willing to be blamed for not choosing some other subject. However\r\nmy compositions are not panegyrics at all but histories.\r\n\r\nMy brother Quintus has written exculpating himself and declaring that he\r\nnever said a word against\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Members who did not speak, but only took part in the division\r\n  (_pedibus ire in sententiam_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  The whole proverb is found in Plutarch’s Life of Aratus, τίς πατέρ’\r\n  αἰνήσει εἰ μὴ κακοδαίμονες υἱοί.\r\n\r\nVerum haec nobis coram summa cura et diligentia sunt agenda; tu modo nos\r\nrevise aliquando.

Maio a. 694_]\r\n\r\nCum e Pompeiano me Romam recepissem a. d. IV Idus Maias, Cincius noster\r\neam mihi abs te epistulam reddidit, quam tu Idibus Febr. dederas. Ei\r\nnunc epistulae litteris his respondebo. Ac primum tibi perspectum esse\r\niudicium de te meum laetor, deinde te in iis rebus, quae mihi asperius a\r\nnobis atque nostris et iniucundius actae videbantur, moderatissimum\r\nfuisse vehementissime gaudeo idque neque amoris mediocris et ingenii\r\nsummi ac sapientiae iudico. Qua de re cum ad me ita suaviter,\r\ndiligenter, officiose, humaniter scripseris, ut non modo te hortari\r\namplius non debeam, sed ne exspectare quidem abs te aut ab ullo homine\r\ntantum facilitatis ac mansuetudinis potuerim, nihil duco esse commodius\r\nquam de his rebus nihil iam amplius scribere. Cum erimus congressi, tum,\r\nsi quid res feret, coram inter nos conferemus.\r\n\r\nQuod ad me de re publica scribis, disputas tu quidem et amanter et\r\nprudenter, et a meis consiliis ratio tua non abhorret; nam neque de\r\nstatu nobis nostrae dignitatis est recedendum neque sine nostris copiis\r\nintra alterius praesidia veniendum, et is, de quo scribis, nihil habet\r\namplum, nihil excelsum, nihil non\r\n\r\nyou to anyone. But that is a point we have to discuss very carefully\r\nwhen we meet, if only you will come and see me some time. This\r\nCossinius, to whom I have given the letter, seems to me a very good\r\nsteady sort of fellow, and devoted to you, exactly as you described him\r\nin your letter. March 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XX\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, May_, B.C. _60_]\r\n\r\nOn my return from my villa at Pompeii on the 12th of May, our friend\r\nCincius passed on to me your letter which was dated the 13th of\r\nFebruary. That is the letter which I shall now answer. And first I must\r\nsay how delighted I am that you fully understood my opinion of you: next\r\nhow very glad I am that you showed such forbearance with regard to the\r\nslights and unkindness which in my opinion you had received from me and\r\nmine: and I count it a sign of affection more than ordinary and the\r\nhighest sense and wisdom. Indeed your answer is so charmingly worded and\r\nwith such consideration and kindliness that not only have I no further\r\nright to press you, but I can never expect to experience such courtesy\r\nand forbearance from you or any other man. So I think it would be best\r\nfor me to say no more about the matter in my letters. If any point\r\narises, we will discuss it together when we meet.\r\n\r\nYour remarks about politics are couched in friendly and prudent terms,\r\nand your view does not differ from my own—for I must not withdraw from\r\nmy dignified position, nor must I enter another’s lines without any\r\nforces of my own, and the man you mention has no broad-mindedness and no\r\nhigh-mindedness,\r\n\r\nsummissum atque populare. Verum tamen fuit ratio mihi fortasse ad\r\ntranquillitatem meorum temporum non inutilis, sed mehercule rei publicae\r\nmulto etiam utilior quam mihi civium improborum impetus in me reprimi,\r\ncum hominis amplissima fortuna, auctoritate, gratia fluctuantem\r\nsententiam confirmassem et a spe malorum ad mearum rerum laudem\r\nconvertissem. Quod si cum aliqua levitate mihi faciendum fuisset, nullam\r\nrem tanti aestimassem; sed tamen a me ita sunt acta omnia, non ut ego\r\nilli adsentiens levior, sed ut ille me probans gravior videretur.\r\nReliqua sic a me aguntur et agentur, ut non committamus, ut ea, quae\r\ngessimus, fortuito gessisse videamur. Meos bonos viros, illos quos\r\nsignificas, et, eam quam mihi dicis obtigisse, Σπάρταν non modo numquam\r\ndeseram, sed etiam, si ego ab illa deserar, tamen in mea pristina\r\nsententia permanebo. Illud tamen velim existimes, me hanc viam optimatem\r\npost Catuli mortem nec praesidio ullo nec comitatu tenere. Nam, ut ait\r\nRhinton, ut opinor,\r\n\r\n              Οἱ μὲν παρ’ οὐδέν εἰσι, τοῖς δ’ οὐδὲν μέλει.\r\n\r\nMihi vero ut invideant piscinarii nostri, aut scribam ad te alias aut in\r\ncongressum nostrum reservabo. A curia autem nulla me res divellet, vel\r\nquod ita rectum\r\n\r\nnothing in him that is not low and time-serving. Well, perhaps the\r\ncourse I took was not opposed to my own advantage and peace of life, but\r\nI swear it was far more to the advantage of the State than to mine that\r\nI should be the means of suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, and of\r\nstrengthening the wavering policy of a man of the highest position,\r\ninfluence and popularity, and converting him from pandering to the\r\ndisloyal to approval of my achievements. If I had had to make any\r\nsacrifice of principle in so doing, I should never have thought it\r\njustifiable: but I managed it so that he seemed to gain in principle by\r\nhis approval of me, more than I lost in bowing to him. I will take care\r\nthat my actions now and in the future do not convey the impression that\r\nwhat I did in the past was done at haphazard. My honest comrades, at\r\nwhom you hint, and the lot[44] which has fallen to me, as you say, I\r\nwill never desert. Nay, even if I am deserted by it I will abide by my\r\nancient principles. But I would have you please remember that, since the\r\ndeath of Catulus, I am holding the way for the conservative party\r\nwithout a garrison and without a comrade. For, as Rhinton, I think it\r\nis, says:\r\n\r\n           Some are stark naught, and naught do others reck.\r\n\r\nHow our friends of the fish-ponds envy me, I will either tell you in\r\nanother letter, or keep it till we meet. But from the Senate house\r\nnothing shall tear me: either because that is the right course, or\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Σπάρταν ἔλαχες ταύταν κόσμει is quoted in full from Euripides’\r\n  Telephus in Att.

Quare, si id exspectas, longum est;\r\nalia via, si qua potes, pugna. Cum est actum, neque animadversum est, ad\r\nquos pertineret, et raptim in eam sententiam pedarii cucurrerunt.\r\nInducendi senatus consulti maturitas nondum est, quod neque sunt, qui\r\nquerantur, et multi partim malevolentia, partim opinione aequitatis\r\ndelectantur.\r\n\r\nMetellus tuus est egregius consul; unum reprehendo, quod otium nuntiari\r\ne Gallia non magno opere gaudet. Cupit, credo, triumphare. Hoc vellem\r\nmediocrius; cetera egregia. Auli filius vero ita se gerit, ut eius\r\nconsulatus non consulatus sit, sed Magni nostri ὑπώπιον.\r\n\r\nDe meis scriptis misi ad te Graece perfectum consulatum meum. Eum librum\r\nL. Cossinio dedi. Puto te Latinis meis delectari, huic autem Graeco\r\nGraecum invidere. Alii si scripserint, mittemus ad te; sed, mihi crede,\r\nsimul atque hoc nostrum legerunt, nescio quo pacto retardantur.\r\n\r\nNunc, ut ad rem meam redeam, L. Papirius Paetus, vir bonus amatorque\r\nnoster, mihi libros eos, quos Ser. Claudius reliquit, donavit. Cum mihi\r\nper legem Cinciam licere capere Cincius, amicus tuus, diceret,\r\n\r\nbecause it is most consistent with my position, or because I am by no\r\nmeans dissatisfied with the Senate’s estimation of me.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Sicyonians, there is very little hope to be placed in the\r\nSenate, as I wrote you before: for there is no one now to raise a\r\ncomplaint. It would be tedious to wait for them to move. Fight the point\r\nin some other way, if you can. When the law was passed, nobody noticed\r\nto whom it applied, and the dummy members plumped eagerly in its favour.\r\nThe time has not yet come for rescinding the decree, because there is no\r\none who complains about it, and some favour it, partly from spite and\r\npartly from an idea of its justness.\r\n\r\nYour friend Metellus is an excellent consul: I have only one fault to\r\nfind with him, he is not at all pleased with the news of peace from\r\nGaul. I take it he wants a triumph. I wish he would moderate that\r\ndesire: in every other way he is excellent. The behaviour of Aulus’s son\r\nmakes his consulship not a consulship, but a blot on the scutcheon[45]\r\nof our friend Pompey.\r\n\r\nI have sent you one of my works, a history of my consulship in Greek. I\r\nhave given it to L. Cossinius. I fancy you like my Latin work, but,\r\nbeing a Greek, envy this Greek one. If others write about it, I will\r\nsend you copies; but I assure you, as soon as they read mine, they\r\nsomehow or other don’t hurry themselves about it.\r\n\r\nNow to return to business. L. Papirius Paetus, my good friend and\r\nadmirer, has offered me the books left to him by Ser. Claudius: and, as\r\nyour friend Cincius said I could take them without breaking the\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Lit. “a black eye.”\r\n\r\nlibenter dixi me accepturum, si attulisset. Nunc, si me amas, si te a me\r\namari scis, enitere per amicos, clientes, hospites, libertos denique ac\r\nservos tuos, ut scida ne qua depereat; nam et Graecis iis libris, quos\r\nsuspicor, et Latinis, quos scio illum reliquisse, mihi vehementer opus\r\nest. Ego autem cotidie magis, quod mihi de forensi labore temporis\r\ndatur, in iis studiis conquiesco. Per mihi, per, inquam, gratum feceris,\r\nsi in hoc tam diligens fueris, quam soles in iis rebus, quas me valde\r\nvelle arbitraris. ipsiusque Paeti tibi negotia commendo, de quibus tibi\r\nille agit maximas gratias, et, ut iam invisas nos, non solum rogo, sed\r\netiam suadeo.\r\n\r\nCincian law[46], I said I would very willingly accept, if he brought\r\nthem here. Now, as you love me, as you know I love you, stir up all your\r\nfriends, clients, guests, freedmen, nay even your slaves, to see that\r\nnot a leaf is lost. For I have urgent necessity for the Greek works,\r\nwhich I suspect, and the Latin books, which I am sure, he left. Every\r\nday I seek my recreation, in such time as is left me from my legal\r\nlabours, more and more in such studies. You will do me the greatest of\r\nfavours, if you will show the same zeal in this as you generally do in\r\nmatters about which you think I am really keen. Paetus’ own affairs I\r\nrecommend to your notice too, and he expresses his deepest gratitude.\r\nAnd I do more than ask you, I urge you, to pay me a visit soon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  The _lex Cincia de donis et muneribus_ (204 B.C.), which forbade\r\n  taking presents for pleading causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           M.

Metellus’s gladiatorial exhibition. He delivered\r\nyour letter, and a memorial of my consulship written in Greek. I felt\r\nvery glad that I gave L. Cossinius the book I had written in Greek on\r\nthe same subject to take to you some time ago. For, if I had read yours\r\nfirst you would say that I had plagiarized from you. Though yours (which\r\nI read with pleasure) seemed to me a trifle rough and unadorned, yet its\r\nvery lack of ornament is an ornament in itself, just as women were\r\nthought to have the best scent who used no scent. My book, on the other\r\nhand, has exhausted all the scent box of Isocrates, and all the\r\nrouge-pots of his pupils, and some of Aristotle’s colours too. You\r\nscanned it through, as you tell me in another letter, at Corcyra, before\r\nyou had received it from Cossinius, I suppose. I should never have dared\r\nto send it to you, if I had not revised it with leisure and care. I sent\r\nthe memoir to Posidonius too, asking him to write something more\r\nelaborate on the same subject; but he tells me that, far from being\r\ninspired to write by the perusal of it, he was decidedly put off. In\r\nfact, I have flabbergasted the whole Greek nation: so I have ceased to\r\nbe plagued by the people who were always hanging about asking me to give\r\nthem something of mine to polish up. If you like the\r\n\r\nliber, curabis, ut et Athenis sit et in ceteris oppidis Graeciae;\r\nvidetur enim posse aliquid nostris rebus lucis adferre. Oratiunculas\r\nautem, et quas postulas, et plures etiam mittam, quoniam quidem ea, quae\r\nnos scribimus adulescentulorum studiis excitati, te etiam delectant.\r\nFuit enim mihi commodum, quod in eis orationibus, quae Philippicae\r\nnominantur, enituerat civis ille tuus Demosthenes, et quod se ab hoc\r\nrefractariolo iudiciali dicendi genere abiunxerat, ut σεμνότερός τις καὶ\r\nπολιτικώτερος videretur, curare, et meae quoque essent orationes, quae\r\nconsulares nominarentur. Quarum una est in senatu Kal. Ianuariis, altera\r\nad populum de lege agraria, tertia de Othone, quarta pro Rabirio, quinta\r\nde proscriptorum filiis, sexta, cum provinciam in contione deposui,\r\nseptima, cum Catilinam emisi, octava, quam habui ad populum, postridie\r\nquam Catilina profugit, nona in contione, quo die Allobroges indicarunt,\r\ndecima in senatu Nonis Decembribus. Sunt praeterea duae breves, quasi\r\nἀποσπασμάτια legis agrariae. Hoc totum σῶμα curabo ut habeas; et,\r\nquoniam te cum scripta tum res meae delectant, isdem ex libris\r\nperspicies, et quae gesserim et quae dixerim; aut ne poposcisses; ego\r\nenim tibi me non offerebam.\r\n\r\nQuod quaeris, quid sit, quo te arcessam, ac simul impeditum te negotiis\r\nesse significas neque recusas, quin, non modo si opus sit, sed etiam si\r\nvelim, accurras, nihil sane est necesse, verum tamen videbare mihi\r\ntempora peregrinationis commodius posse discribere. Nimis abes diu,\r\npraesertim cum sis in propinquis\r\n\r\nbook, you will see to it that Athens and other Greek towns have it in\r\nstock; for I think it may add some lustre to my achievements. I will\r\nsend you the bits of speeches you ask for and some more too, as you find\r\nsome interest in things which I write to satisfy young admirers. Your\r\nfellow-citizen, Demosthenes, gained a reputation by the speeches called\r\nthe Philippics, in which he departed from the quibbling style of\r\npleading we use in the law-courts, and appeared in the role of a serious\r\npolitician. So I took a fancy to leave behind me also some speeches\r\nwhich may be called consular. One was delivered in the House on the 1st\r\nof January, another to the people on the agrarian law, the third on\r\nOtho, the fourth for Rabirius, the fifth for the sons of the proscribed,\r\nthe sixth when I declined a province in a public assembly, the seventh\r\nwhen I drove Catiline out, the eighth before the people the day after\r\nCatiline fled, the ninth in an assembly on the day when the Allobroges\r\ngave their information, the tenth in the House on the 5th of December.\r\nThere are two more short ones, mere scraps of the agrarian law. I will\r\nsee that you have the whole _corpus_; and, since both my writing and my\r\nachievements interest you, you will see from them what I have done, and\r\nwhat I have written. Or else you should not have asked for them: I was\r\nnot the one to obtrude them.\r\n\r\nYou inquire why I ask you to come back, and hint that you are hindered\r\nby business. Still you don’t refuse to come, if there is any need, or\r\neven if I wish it. There is no real necessity; but it does seem to me\r\nthat you could arrange your times for going away more conveniently. You\r\nare away too long, especially when you are quite near, and\r\n\r\nlocis, neque nos te fruimur, et tu nobis cares. Ac nunc quidem otium\r\nest, sed, si paulo plus furor Pulchelli progredi posset, valde ego te\r\nistim excitarem. Verum praeclare Metellus impedit et impediet. Quid\r\nquaeris? est consul φιλόπατρις et, ut semper iudicavi, natura bonus.\r\nIlle autem non simulat, sed plane tribunus pl. fieri cupit. Qua de re\r\ncum in senatu ageretur, fregi hominem et inconstantiam eius reprehendi,\r\nqui Romae tribunatum pl. peteret, cum in Sicilia hereditatem se petere\r\ndictitasset, neque magno opere dixi esse nobis laborandum, quod nihilo\r\nmagis ei liciturum esset plebeio rem publicam perdere, quam similibus\r\neius me consule patriciis esset licitum. Iam, cum se ille septimo die\r\nvenisse a freto, neque sibi obviam quemquam prodire potuisse, et noctu\r\nse introisse dixisset, in eoque se in contione iactasset, nihil ei novi\r\ndixi accidisse. “Ex Sicilia septimo die Romam; ante tribus horis Roma\r\nInteramnam. Noctu introisse; idem ante. Non est itum obviam; ne tum\r\nquidem, cum iri maxime debuit.” Quid quaeris? hominem petulantem\r\nmodestum reddo non solum perpetua gravitate orationis, sed etiam hoc\r\ngenere dictorum. Itaque iam familiariter cum ipso cavillor ac iocor;\r\nquin etiam, rum candidatum deduceremus, quaerit ex me, num consuessem\r\nSiculis locum gladiatoribus dare. Negavi. “At ego,” inquit, “novus\r\n\r\nso I have no chance of enjoying your society and you lack mine. Just at\r\npresent things are peaceful: but if that little beauty[47] should be\r\nstrong enough to indulge in any wilder freaks I should certainly be\r\nrouting you out of your retreat. However, Metellus is holding him in\r\nnobly and will continue to do so. Most assuredly he is a thoroughly\r\npatriotic consul, and, as I always thought, an excellent fellow. Clodius\r\ndoes not beat about the bush, he is quite plainly aiming at the\r\ntribunate. When the point was discussed in the Senate, I sat on him,\r\naccusing him of inconsistency, for seeking the tribunate now in Rome,\r\nwhen in Sicily he did nothing but repeat that what he wanted was an\r\ninheritance. However, I added, we need not put ourselves about on that\r\npoint, as he would not be allowed to ruin the country if he becomes a\r\nplebeian any more than patricians of his kidney were allowed to in my\r\nconsulship. Then, when he said he had come from the straits in a week,\r\nso that no one could go to meet him, and had entered the city at night,\r\nand boasted of the fact in a public speech, I said there was nothing new\r\nin that. “Seven days from Sicily to Rome: the other time three hours\r\nfrom Rome to Interamna. He came in at night: so he did before. No one\r\nmet him now: nor did anyone meet him last time, when they certainly\r\nought to have done so.” In fact, I am taking the cheek out of him, not\r\nonly by serious set speeches, but by quips of this kind too. So nowadays\r\nI bandy jests and banter with him quite familiarly. For instance, when\r\nwe were escorting a candidate, he asked me whether I used to give the\r\nSicilians seats at the gladiatorial shows. I said, “No.” “Well,” said\r\nhe,\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  P. Clodius Pulcher.\r\n\r\npatronus instituam; sed soror, quae tantum habeat consularis loci, unum\r\nmihi solum pedem dat.” “Noli,” inquam “de uno pede sororis queri; licet\r\netiam alterum tollas.” Non consulare, inquies, dictum. Fateor; sed ego\r\nillam odi male consularem. “Ea est enim seditiosa, ea cum viro bellum\r\ngerit” neque solum cum Metello, sed etiam cum Fabio, quod eos[48] in hoc\r\nesse moleste fert.\r\n\r\nQuod de agraria lege quaeris, sane iam videtur refrixisse. Quod me\r\nquodam modo molli brachio de Pompei familiaritate obiurgas, nolim ita\r\nexistimes, me mei praesidii causa cum illo coniunctum esse, sed ita res\r\nerat instituta, ut, si inter nos esset aliqua forte dissensio, maximas\r\nin re publica discordias versari esset necesse. Quod a me ita praecautum\r\natque provisum est, non ut ego de optima illa mea ratione decederem, sed\r\nut ille esset melior et aliquid de populari levitate deponeret. Quem de\r\nmeis rebus, in quas eum multi incitarant, multo scito gloriosius quam de\r\nsuis praedicare; sibi enim bene gestae, mihi conservatae rei publicae\r\ndat testimonium. Hoc facere illum mihi quam prosit, nescio; rei publicae\r\ncerte prodest. Quid? si etiam Caesarem, cuius nunc venti valde sunt\r\nsecundi, reddo meliorem, num tantum obsum rei publicae? Quin etiam, si\r\nmihi nemo invideret, si omnes, ut erat aequum, faverent, tamen non minus\r\nesset probanda medicina, quae sanaret vitiosas partes rei publicae, quam\r\nquae exsecaret.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  eos esse in hoc esse _MSS._\r\n\r\n“now I am their new patron, I intend to begin the practice: though my\r\nsister, who, as the consul’s wife, has such a lot of room, will not give\r\nme more than standing room.” “Oh, don’t grumble about standing room with\r\nyour sister,” I answered. “You can always lie with her.” You will say it\r\nwas not the remark for a consular to make. I confess it was not; but I\r\nhate the woman, so unworthy of a consul. “For she’s a shrew and wrangles\r\nwith her mate,” and not only with Metellus, but with Fabius too, because\r\nshe is annoyed at their interference in this affair.\r\n\r\nYou ask about the agrarian law. Interest in it seems to have cooled\r\ndown. You give me a gentle fillip for my familiarity with Pompey. Please\r\ndon’t imagine I have allied myself to him solely to save my skin: the\r\nposition of affairs is such that, if we had had any disagreement, there\r\nwould of necessity have been great discord in the State. Against that I\r\nhave taken precautions and made provision without wavering from my own\r\nexcellent policy, while making him more loyal and less the people’s\r\nweathercock. He speaks, I may tell you, far more glowingly about my\r\nachievements than about his own, though many have tried to set him\r\nagainst me, saying that he did his duty to the country, but I saved it.\r\nWhat good his statements will do me, I fail to see: but they will\r\ncertainly do the country good. Well! If I can make Caesar, who is now\r\nsailing gaily before the breeze, a better patriot too, shall I be doing\r\nso poor a service to the country? And, even if none were to envy me and\r\nall supported me, as they ought, still a remedy which cures the diseased\r\nparts of the State should be preferable to one which amputates them.\r\n\r\nNunc vero, cum equitatus ille, quem ego in clivo Capitolino te signifero\r\nac principe collocaram, senatum deseruerit, nostri autem principes\r\ndigito se caelum putent attingere, si mulli barbati in piscinis sint,\r\nqui ad manum accedant, alia autem neglegant, nonne tibi satis prodesse\r\nvideor, si perficio, ut nolint obesse, qui possunt? Nam Catonem nostrum\r\nnon tu amas plus quam ego; sed tamen ille optimo animo utens et summa\r\nfide nocet interdum rei publicae; dicit enim tamquam in Platonis\r\nπολιτείᾳ, non tamquam in Romuli faece sententiam. Quid verius quam in\r\niudicium venire, qui ob rem iudicandam pecuniam acceperit? Censuit hoc\r\nCato, adsensit senatus; equites curiae bellum, non mihi; nam ego\r\ndissensi. Quid impudentius publicanis renuntiantibus? fuit tamen\r\nretinendi ordinis causa faciunda iactura. Restitit et pervicit Cato.\r\nItaque nunc consule in carcere incluso, saepe item seditione commota\r\naspiravit nemo eorum, quorum ego concursu itemque ii consules, qui post\r\nme fuerunt, rem publicam defendere solebant. “Quid ergo? istos,”\r\ninquies, “mercede conductos habebimus?” Quid faciemus, si aliter non\r\npossumus? An libertinis atque etiam servis serviamus? Sed, ut tu ais,\r\nἅλις σπουδῆς.\r\n\r\nBut as it is, when the knights, whom I once stationed on the Capitoline\r\nhill with you as their standard-bearer and leader, have deserted the\r\nSenate, and our great men think themselves in the seventh heaven, if\r\nthey have bearded mullet in their fish-ponds that will feed from their\r\nhand, and don’t care about anything else, surely you must allow that I\r\nhave done my best, if I manage to take the will to do harm from those\r\nwho have the power to do it. For our friend Cato is not more to you than\r\nto me: but still with the best of intentions and unimpeachable honesty\r\nat times he does harm to the country: for the opinions he delivers would\r\nbe more in place in Plato’s Republic than among the dregs of humanity\r\ncollected by Romulus.[49] That a man who accepts a bribe for the verdict\r\nhe returns at a trial should be put on trial himself is as fair a\r\nprinciple as one could wish. Cato voted for it and won the House’s\r\nassent. Result, a war of the knights with the Senate, but not with me. I\r\nwas against it. That the tax-collectors should repudiate their bargain\r\nwas a most shameless proceeding. But we ought to have put up with the\r\nloss in order to keep their good-will. Cato resisted and carried the\r\nday. Result, though we’ve had a consul in prison, and frequent riots,\r\nnot a breath of encouragement from one of those, who in my own\r\nconsulship and that of my successors used to rally round us to defend\r\nthe country. “Must we then bribe them for their support?” you will ask.\r\nWhat help is there, if we cannot get it otherwise? Are we to be slaves\r\nof freedmen and slaves? But, as you say, enough of the _grand sérieux_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Possibly “among the dregs of [the city] of Romulus”; but Plutarch, who\r\n  translates it ἐν Ῥωμύλου ὑποστάθμῃ, (_Phoc._ 3), is against that\r\n  rendering.\r\n\r\nFavonius meam tribum tulit honestius quam suam, Luccei perdidit.\r\nAccusavit Nasicam inhoneste ac modeste tamen. Dixit ita, ut Rhodi\r\nvideretur molis potius quam Moloni operam dedisse. Mihi, quod\r\ndefendissem, leviter suscensuit. Nunc tamen petit iterum rei publicae\r\ncausa. Lucceius quid agat, scribam ad te, cum Caesarem videro, qui\r\naderit biduo. Quod Sicyonii te laedunt, Catoni et eius aemulatori\r\nattribuis Servilio. Quid? ea plaga nonne ad multos bonos viros pertinet?\r\nSed, si ita placuit, laudemus, deinde in discessionibus soli\r\nrelinquamur.\r\n\r\nAmalthea mea te exspectat et indiget tui. Tusculanum et Pompeianum valde\r\nme delectant, nisi quod me, illum ipsum vindicem aeris alieni, aere non\r\nCorinthio, sed hoc circumforaneo obruerunt. In Gallia speramus esse\r\notium. Prognostica mea cum oratiunculis prope diem exspecta et tamen,\r\nquid cogites de adventu tuo, scribe ad nos. Nam mihi Pomponia nuntiari\r\niussit te mense Quintili Romae fore. Id a tuis litteris, quas ad me de\r\ncensu tuo miseras, discrepabat.\r\n\r\nPaetus, ut antea ad te scripsi, omnes libros, quos frater suus\r\nreliquisset, mihi donavit. Hoc illius munus in tua diligentia positum\r\nest. Si me amas, cura, ut conserventur et ad me perferantur; hoc mihi\r\nnihil potest esse gratius. Et cum Graecos tum vero\r\n\r\nFavonius carried my tribe with even more credit than his own, but lost\r\nthat of Lucceius. His accusation of Nasica was nothing to be proud of;\r\nhowever he conducted it very moderately. He spoke so badly that one\r\nwould think he devoted more time at Rhodes to grinding in the mills than\r\nat Molo’s lectures. I got into his bad books for undertaking the\r\ndefence; however he is standing again now on public grounds. How\r\nLucceius is getting on I will write and tell you, when I have seen\r\nCaesar, who will be here in a couple of days’ time. The wrong the\r\nSicyonians have done you, you attribute to Cato and his imitator\r\nServilius. But does not the blow affect many good citizens? However, if\r\nit so pleases them, let us acquiesce, and be utterly deserted at the\r\nnext question put to the vote.\r\n\r\nMy Amalthea is waiting and longing for you. I am delighted with my\r\nplaces at Tusculum and Pompeii, except that, champion of creditors as I\r\nam, they have overwhelmed me not so much with Corinthian bronze as with\r\ndebts in the common copper coin of the realm. We hope things have\r\nsettled down in Gaul. Expect my Prognostics[50] and my bits of speeches\r\nvery shortly: but for all that write and tell me your plans about\r\ncoming. Pomponia has sent a message that you will be in Rome in July:\r\nbut that disagrees with the letter you sent to me about placing your\r\nname on the census list.\r\n\r\nPaetus, as I have already mentioned, has given me the books left him by\r\nhis brother: but this gift depends on your kind services. As you love\r\nme, see that they are preserved and brought to me. You could do me no\r\ngreater favour: and I should like the\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  A translation of Aratus’ Διοσημεῖα.\r\n\r\ndiligenter Latinos ut conserves velim.

I shall count them a present from\r\nyourself. I have written to Octavius, but not spoken to him about it:\r\nfor I did not know that your business extended to the provinces, nor did\r\nI count you among the Shylocks. But I have written as punctiliously as\r\nduty bade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _At his country house, Dec. (?)_, B.C. _60_]\r\n\r\nLook well after my little namesake. I am ill with him by sympathy. I\r\nhave in hand my treatise on the constitution of Pellene, and you should\r\nsee the huge heap of Dicaearchus that I have piled at my feet. What a\r\ngreat man! You could learn a lot more from him than from Procilius. I\r\nbelieve I have got his works on the constitutions of Corinth and Athens\r\nat Rome: and you may take my word for it that, if you read them, you\r\nwill exclaim “The man is a wonder.” If Herodes had any sense in him, he\r\nwould spend his time reading him and never write a single letter of the\r\nalphabet. He has attacked me by post, and you, as I see, in person. I\r\nwould far rather have joined in the conspiracy than opposed it, if I had\r\nthought I should have to pay for it by listening to him. As regards the\r\ndarnel, you must be losing your senses: but about the wine I quite agree\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nBut, I say, have you noticed the Kalends are coming, and there is no\r\nAntonius? Though the jury is being empanelled,—at least they tell me so,\r\nand that Nigidius is threatening in a public meeting to serve a summons\r\non any juror who does not attend. If you\r\n\r\nAntoni adventu quod audieris, scribas ad me et, quoniam huc non venis,\r\ncenes apud nos utique pridie Kal. Cave aliter facias.

The verdict is generally thought to be a\r\nconcession to Aulus’ son; and I expect Iphicrates[54] has been up to\r\nsome tricks, as you suggest. I didn’t like the look of his military\r\nboots and puttees. We shall know what it was, when you arrive.\r\n\r\nIn finding fault with the narrowness of my windows, let me tell you, you\r\nare finding fault with the Education of Cyrus[55]: for, when I made the\r\nsame remark to Cyrus, he said that the view of gardens was not so\r\npleasant, if the windows were broad. For, let _a_ be the point of\r\nvision, and _b, c_ the object, and _d, e_ the rays,—you see what\r\nfollows. If our sight resulted from the impact of images,[56] the images\r\nwould be horribly squeezed in the narrow space: but, as it is, the\r\nemission of rays goes on merrily. If you have any other faults to find,\r\nyou will find me ready with an answer, unless they are such as can be\r\nput to rights without expense.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Obviously a nickname for Pompey, and, in view of the next sentence,\r\n  the name of Iphicrates, who invented a military boot, seems more\r\n  likely than Epicrates, which would mean “our influential friend.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  A play on the title of Xenophon’s book the _Cyropaedeia_ and the name\r\n  of Cicero’s architect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Democritus and the Epicureans held that sight resulted from the\r\n  incidence of images cast by external things upon the eyes. The view\r\n  supported by Cicero, that it resulted from rays sent out from the\r\n  eyes, was that held by Plato.\r\n\r\nVenio nunc ad mensem Ianuarium et ad ὑπόστασιν nostram ac πολιτείαν, in\r\nqua Σωκρατικῶς εἰς ἑκάτερον, sed tamen ad extremum, ut illi solebant,\r\nτὴν ἀρέσκουσαν. Est res sane magni consilii; nam aut fortiter\r\nresistendum est legi agrariae, in quo est quaedam dimicatio, sed plena\r\nlaudis, aut quiescendum, quod est non dissimile atque ire in Solonium\r\naut Antium, aut etiam adiuvandum, quod a me aiunt Caesarem sic\r\nexspectare, ut non dubitet. Nam fuit apud me Cornelius, hunc dico\r\nBalbum, Caesaris familiarem. Is adfirmabat illum omnibus in rebus meo et\r\nPompei consilio usurum daturumque operam, ut cum Pompeio Crassum\r\nconiungeret. Hic sunt haec, coniunctio mihi summa cum Pompeio, si\r\nplacet, etiam cum Caesare, reditus in gratiam cum inimicis, pax cum\r\nmultitudine, senectutis otium. Sed me κατακλεὶς mea illa commovet, quae\r\nest in libro tertio:\r\n\r\n            “Interea cursus, quos prima a parte iuventae\r\n            Quosque adeo consul virtute animoque petisti,\r\n            Hos retine atque auge famam laudesque bonorum.”\r\n\r\nHaec mihi cum in eo libro, in quo multa sunt scripta ἀριστοκρατικῶς,\r\nCalliope ipsa praescripserit, non opinor esse dubitandum, quin semper\r\nnobis videatur\r\n\r\n               εἷς οἰωνὸς ἄριστος ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης.\r\n\r\nSed haec ambulationibus Compitaliciis reservemus. Tu pridie Compitalia\r\nmemento. Balineum calfieri iubebo. Et Pomponiam Terentia rogat; matrem\r\n\r\nNow I come to January and my political attitude; and I shall follow the\r\nfashion of the Socratic schools in giving both sides of the question,\r\nending, however, as they do, with the one which I prefer. It really is a\r\npoint that requires much consideration. For either I have got to resist\r\nthe agrarian measure strongly, which would mean something of a fight,\r\nthough I should gain prestige by it; or I must hold my peace, which is\r\nequivalent to retiring to Solonium or Antium; or else I must assist the\r\nmeasure, and that is what they say Caesar expects me to do beyond a\r\ndoubt. For Cornelius paid me a visit—I mean Balbus, Caesar’s great\r\nfriend. He assured me that Caesar will take my own and Pompey’s opinion\r\non everything, and that he will make an effort to reconcile Pompey and\r\nCrassus. On this side of the sheet may be placed an intimate connection\r\nwith Pompey and, if I like, with Caesar too, reconciliation with my\r\nenemies, peace with the populace, and ease in my old age. But my blood\r\nis still stirred by the _finale_ I laid down for myself in the 3rd book\r\nof my poem:[57]\r\n\r\n         “Meantime the course you chose in youth’s first spring\r\n         And held to, heart and soul, ’mid civic strife\r\n         Keep still, with growing fame and good report.”\r\n\r\nSince Calliope herself dictated those verses to me in a book full of\r\npassages in lordly vein, I ought not to have the least hesitation in\r\nholding “no omen, better [Sidenote: Iliad xii, 243] than to right one’s\r\ncountry’s wrongs.”\r\n\r\nBut this point must be reserved for our strolls at the Compitalia. Do\r\nyou remember the day before the festival. I will order the bath to be\r\nheated, and Terentia is going to invite Pomponia. We will make\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  On his consulship.\r\n\r\nadiungemus.

Since I am mentioning money matters,\r\nplease settle up with Titinius as best you can. If he won’t stand by his\r\nagreement, the best plan, so far as I can see, will be to return the\r\ngoods for which he made a bad bargain, if Pomponia will consent to that\r\ncourse: if even that won’t work, then give him his money back rather\r\nthan have a fuss. I should be very glad if you would finish the business\r\nbefore you leave, with your usual kindness and carefulness.\r\n\r\nSo Clodius is going to Tigranes you say! I wish it were on the same\r\nterms as that Scepsian.[58] But I don’t envy him. It will be a much more\r\nconvenient time for me to get a free travelling pass, when my brother\r\nQuintus has settled down in peace, as I hope he will, and when I know\r\nthe intentions of that priest of Bona Dea.[59] Meantime I shall settle\r\ndown to the enjoyment of the Muses with resignation, indeed\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Metrodorus of Scepsus was sent by Mithridates to urge Tigranes to wage\r\n  war with Rome, but privately spoke against it.

Let me have any political news you may worm out, especially who\r\nyou think are likely to be consuls. However, I am not very anxious. I\r\nhave made up my mind to forget politics for the time.\r\n\r\nI have had a good look at Terentia’s woodlands, and can only say, that,\r\nif there was a Dodonaean oak there, I should feel as though I possessed\r\nthe whole of Epirus.

What would history be saying of me six hundred years hence? And\r\nthat is a thing I fear much more than the petty gossip of those who are\r\nalive to-day. But I suppose I can only lie low and see what turns up. If\r\nan offer is made to me, the decision will to some extent rest in my own\r\nhands, and then I will consider the question. Upon my word there is some\r\nlittle glory even in refusing: so, if Theophanes should happen to\r\nconsult you, don’t decline point blank.\r\n\r\nThis is what I am hoping to hear from you in your letter:—what Arrius\r\nhas to say for himself, and how he takes Caesar’s desertion of him,\r\nwhether popular report is right in speaking of Pompey and Crassus as the\r\nfavourites for the consulship, or a correspondent of mine who mentions\r\nGabinius and Servius Sulpicius, whether there are any new laws or any\r\nnews at all, and to whom the augurship will be offered, now that Nepos\r\nis going away. That is the only bait with which they could catch me. You\r\nsee how cheap I am going. But this is a forbidden subject. I mean to\r\nforget it, and devote myself heart and soul to philosophy. That, I\r\nassure you, is my intention; and I only wish I had always practised it.\r\nNow that I have sampled the vanity of what I once thought\r\n\r\nexpertus sum quam essent inania, cum omnibus Musis rationem habere\r\ncogito.

Please let me\r\nknow on what day you are leaving Rome, so that I can tell you where I\r\nshall be: and let me have a letter at once on the points I have\r\nmentioned, for I look forward to your letters very eagerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antium April_ B.C. _59_]\r\n\r\nI am not so certain now about fulfilling the promises I made in former\r\nletters to produce some work in this tour: for I have fallen so in love\r\nwith idleness, that I can’t tear myself from it. So I either enjoy\r\nmyself with my books, of which I have a jolly good lot at Antium, or\r\nelse count the waves: the rough weather won’t allow me to catch shads.\r\nAt writing my soul rebels utterly. The geographical work I had planned\r\nis a big undertaking. Eratosthenes, whom I had taken as my authority, is\r\nseverely criticized by Serapion and Hipparchus; and, if I take\r\nTyrannio’s views too, there is no telling what the result would be.\r\nBesides the subject is confoundedly hard to explain and monotonous, nor\r\ndoes it give one as many opportunities for flowers of fancy as I\r\nimagined: besides—and this is the chief point—I find any excuse for\r\nidleness good enough. I am even debating settling down at Antium, and\r\nspending the rest of my life here: and I really wish I had been a\r\nmagistrate here\r\n\r\nquam Romae fuisse. Tu vero sapientior Buthroti domum parasti. Sed, mihi\r\ncrede, proxima est illi municipio haec Antiatium civitas. Esse locum tam\r\nprope Romam, ubi multi sint, qui Vatinium numquam viderint, ubi nemo sit\r\npraeter me, qui quemquam ex viginti viris vivum et salvum velit, ubi me\r\ninterpellet nemo, diligant omnes! Hic, hic nimirum πολιτευτέον; nam\r\nistic non solum non licet, sed etiam taedet. Itaque ἀνέκδοτα, quae tibi\r\nuni legamus, Theopompio genere aut etiam asperiore multo pangentur.\r\nNeque aliud iam quicquam πολιτεύομαι nisi odisse improbos et id ipsum\r\nnullo cum stomacho, sed potius cum aliqua scribendi voluptate.\r\n\r\nSed ut ad rem, scripsi ad quaestores urbanos de Quinti fratris negotio.\r\nVide, quid narrent, ecquae spes sit denarii, an cistophoro Pompeiano\r\niaceamus. Praeterea de muro statue quid faciendum sit. Aliud quid?\r\nEtiam. Quando te proficisci istinc putes, fac ut sciam.\r\n\r\nrather than in Rome. You have been wiser in your generation and made a\r\nhome for yourself at Buthrotum: but you may take my word for it that\r\nthis township of Antium runs your borough very close. To think of there\r\nbeing a place so near Rome, where there are lots of people who have\r\nnever seen Vatinius, where there is not a single soul save myself who\r\ncares whether any of our new commissioners are alive or dead, where no\r\none intrudes upon me, though every one is fond of me. This, this is the\r\nvery place for me to play the politician: for there in Rome, besides\r\nbeing shut out of politics, I am sick of them. So I will compose a\r\nprivate memoir, which I will read only to you, in the style of\r\nTheopompus, or even a still bitterer vein. My only policy now is hatred\r\nof the radicals: and that without rancour, indeed with some pleasure in\r\nexpressing it.\r\n\r\nBut to return to business, I have written to the city quaestors about my\r\nbrother Quintus’ affairs. See what they have to say, and whether there\r\nis any hope of our getting current coin, or whether we must put up with\r\nPompey’s pice.[61] Also decide what is to be done with the wall. Is\r\nthere anything else I meant to say? Yes. Let me know when you think of\r\ngoing away.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  The _cistophorus_ was an Asiatic coin, of which Pompey had deposited a\r\n  large quantity in the treasury. Apparently there was some idea of\r\n  using them for paying Quintus during his proconsulship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

As to the two speeches\r\nyou ask for, one I did not want to write down, because I had broken off\r\nin the middle, the other, because I had no desire to praise a man whom I\r\ndid not like. But that too I will see about. Something shall appear\r\nanyhow, to convince you that I have not idled all my time away.\r\n\r\nI am highly delighted with the news about Publius, please investigate\r\nall the details thoroughly, and bring a full account with you when you\r\ncome. Meantime, if you pick up any hints, or draw any inferences, write\r\nto me, especially as to what he is going to do about the embassy. For my\r\npart, before 1 read your letter, I wished the man would go, not, I\r\nassure you, through any desire to postpone his impeachment—for I am\r\nextraordinarily anxious to conduct the case—but because I thought that\r\nhe would lose any popularity he had gained by turning plebeian. “Why did\r\nyou transfer yourself to the plebs? Was it to pay a visit to Tigranes?\r\nPray tell me: don’t the kings of Armenia return the visit of a\r\npatrician?” As you see, I had sharpened my wits up to rally him on the\r\nsubject of his embassy. But if he rejects it with scorn, and, as you\r\nsay, thereby rouses the indignation of the proposers and augurs of the\r\nbill of adoption, it will be a grand sight. To speak the honest truth,\r\nyou know, our friend Publius is being treated with very scant courtesy.\r\nIn the first place, though he was once the only man in\r\n\r\ndomi Caesaris quandam unus vir fuerit, nunc ne in viginti quidem esse\r\npotuerit; deinde alia legatio dicta erat, alia data est. Illa opima ad\r\nexigendas pecunias Druso, ut opinor, Pisaurensi an epuloni Vatinio\r\nreservatur; haec ieiuna tabellarii legatio datur ei, cuius tribunatus ad\r\nistorum tempora reservatur. Incende hominem, amabo te, quod potes. Una\r\nspes est salutis istorum inter ipsos dissensio; cuius ego quaedam initia\r\nsensi ex Curione.

My one hope of\r\nsafety lies in their mutual disagreement: and from Curio I gather that\r\nthere is a hint of such a thing. Arrius is beginning to rage at being\r\nrobbed of his consulship: Megabocchus and the rest of that bloodthirsty\r\nband of youths are at daggers drawn with them.

That is Cato’s fault, but it is still more through the villainy of\r\nthose who have disregarded auspices and the Aelian law, the Iunian and\r\nLicinian law and the Caecilian and Didian law, who have thrown out of\r\nthe window all the physic for the State, who have given kingdoms to\r\ntetrarchs as though they were farms and immense sums of money to one or\r\ntwo people. I can see already which way jealousy is tending and where it\r\nwill come home to roost. Count me too big a dunce to have learned\r\nanything by experience or from Theophrastus, if you do not see very\r\nshortly men mourning for the days of my government.

But what I can’t make out is how Caesar\r\ncan possibly find any solution of the land question which will not meet\r\nwith opposition.

But of course I have no doubt that you would fly to my side, if\r\nanything of the kind were to happen. But, even if this does not happen,\r\nI am looking forward to a sight worth seeing, whether he runs amuck or\r\nsaves the state, if I can watch it with you sitting by my side.\r\n\r\nJust as I was writing these words, in comes Sebosus: and I had hardly\r\nfetched a sigh, when there was Arrius saying “Good day.” This is going\r\nout of town!

I\r\nshall certainly be off to “My native hills, the cradle of my youth.” To\r\nput it shortly, if I can’t be alone, I would rather be with countryfolk\r\nthan with these ultra-city men. However, as you send no definite date, I\r\nwill wait for you at Formiae till the 5th of May.\r\n\r\nTerentia is much gratified by the attention and care you have bestowed\r\non her dispute with Mulvius.

Well, at first it startled me so that\r\nit banished all desire to sleep, though it was thought rather than\r\nuneasiness that kept me awake. The result of my cogitations was\r\nsomething of this sort. First, when you said in your last letter you had\r\nheard from a great friend of Caesar’s that some proposal was going to be\r\nmade to which no one could object, I had feared some sweeping measure;\r\nbut this I don’t consider anything of the kind. Secondly—and that is\r\nsome consolation to me—all hope of agrarian distribution seems to have\r\nbeen diverted to the Campanian land. Supposing that the allotments are\r\nabout 6 acres apiece, that land will not hold more than 5,000 people; so\r\nthey have to offend all the rest of the masses. Besides, if anything is\r\ncalculated to arouse a fiercer pitch of indignation in the minds of the\r\nconservatives, who are obviously getting roused already, this is the\r\nvery thing that will; all the more so because there won’t be any home\r\ntax left except the 5 per cent.,[76] now that the customs duties have\r\nbeen abolished, if the Campanian land is distributed: and that, I fancy,\r\nit would take only one petty harangue assisted by the cheers of our\r\nlacqueys to abolish. What on earth our friend Gnaeus is thinking of in\r\nletting himself be carried so far, I cannot tell:\r\n\r\n               He blows no more on slender pipe of reed,\r\n               But fierce unmodulated trumpet-blasts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  On manumitted slaves.\r\n\r\nhaec ἐσοφίζετο, se leges Caesaris probare, actiones ipsum praestare\r\ndebere; agrariam legem sibi placuisse, potuerit intercedi necne, nihil\r\nad se pertinere; de rege Alexandrino placuisse sibi aliquando confici,\r\nBibulus de caelo tum servasset necne, sibi quaerendum non fuisse; de\r\npublicanis voluisse se illi ordini commodare, quid futurum fuerit, si\r\nBibulus tum in forum descendisset, se divinare non potuisse. Nunc vero,\r\nSampsicerame, quid dices? vectigal te nobis in monte Antilibano\r\nconstituisse, agri Campani abstulisse? Quid? hoc quem ad modum\r\nobtinebis? “Oppressos vos,” inquit, “tenebo exercitu Caesaris.” Non\r\nmehercule me tu quidem tam isto exercitu quam ingratis animis eorum\r\nhominum, qui appellantur boni, qui mihi non mode praemiorum, sed ne\r\nsermonum quidem umquam fructum ullum aut gratiam rettulerunt. Quodsi in\r\neam me partem incitarem, profecto iam aliquam reperirem resistendi viam.\r\nNunc prorsus hoc statui, ut, quoniam tanta controversia est Dicaearcho,\r\nfamiliari tuo, cum Theophrasto, amico meo, ut ille tuus τὸν πρακτικὸν\r\nβίον longe omnibus anteponat, hic autem τὸν θεωρητικόν, utrique a me mos\r\ngestus esse videatur. Puto enim me Dicaearcho adfatim satis fecisse;\r\nrespicio nunc ad hanc familiam, quae mihi non modo, ut requiescam,\r\npermittit, sed reprehendit, quia non semper quierim. Quare incumbamus, o\r\nnoster Tite, ad illa praeclara studia et\r\n\r\nFor up to now he has chopped logic about the matter, saying that he\r\napproved of Caesar’s laws, but it was for Caesar to see to their\r\npassing: that the agrarian law was sound enough to his mind, but whether\r\nit could be vetoed by a tribune or not did not matter to him: he thought\r\nit was high time the question was settled with the king of Alexandria:\r\nwhether Bibulus had been watching for omens or not at that particular\r\nmoment was no business of his: as for the tax-gatherers, they were a\r\nclass that he wished to oblige: what was going to happen, if Bibulus\r\ncame down to the forum on that occasion, he could not have prophesied.\r\nBut now what has the Pasha got to say for himself? That he imposed a tax\r\non Antilibanus and took it off the Campanian land? Well, I don’t see how\r\nhe will make it good. “I will keep you in check with Caesar’s army,” he\r\nsays. No, not me at least; that army will not restrain me so much as the\r\nungrateful minds of the so-called constitutionalists, who have not\r\nrepaid my services even by thanks, much less by more substantial\r\nrewards. But, if I were really to rouse myself to energy against that\r\nparty, I would certainly find some means of resisting them. As it is,\r\nsince there is such an endless controversy between your intimate\r\nDicaearchus and my friend Theophrastus, Dicaearchus giving the\r\npreference to a practical life, Theophrastus to a contemplative, I have\r\nset my mind on making it clear that I have humoured them both. I take it\r\nI have fully satisfied Dicaearchus: now I am turning my eye to the other\r\nschool, which not only gives me permission to take my ease now, but\r\nblames me for ever having done anything else. So, my dear Titus, let me\r\nthrow myself heart and soul into those excellent studies,\r\n\r\neo, unde discedere non oportuit, aliquando revertamur.\r\n\r\nQuod de Quinti fratris epistula scribis, ad me quoque fuit πρόσθε λέων,\r\nὄπιθεν δὲ—[77]quid dicam, nescio; nam ita deplorat primis versibus\r\nmansionem suam, ut quemvis movere possit, ita rursus remittit, ut me\r\nroget, ut annales suos emendem et edam.

Please pay some attention to the point you mention about the\r\ndues on goods transferred from port to port. He says he referred it to\r\nthe Senate by the advice of his assessors. Evidently he had not read my\r\nletter, in which I told him after careful consideration and research\r\nthat no tax was legally due. If any Greeks have come from Asia to Rome\r\nabout it, please see them, and, it you think fit, tell them my opinion.\r\nIf I can recant, I will do as the tax collectors wish, rather than see\r\nthe good cause worsted in the House: but, if not, I candidly confess I\r\nprefer the interests of the whole of Asia and the merchants, for I feel\r\nit is really a matter of great importance to them. I think, however, it\r\nis a case of necessity for us. But you will see to it. Are the\r\nquaestors, then, still debating about the currency? If there is no\r\nescape from it in spite of all our efforts, I shouldn’t turn up my nose\r\nat the Asiatic coins as the last resource.

What else is the meaning of this sudden marriage-contract,[79]\r\nof the proposals about the Campanian land, of this reckless expenditure\r\nof money? If that were the end of it, it would be disastrous enough: but\r\nthe nature of the case makes it impossible that this should be the end.\r\nThese things in themselves cannot possibly give them any pleasure: and\r\nthey would never have taken this step except as the first to other\r\npernicious acts. But, as you say, we will discuss these questions\r\nrationally at Arpinum about the 10th of May, and not prove all the\r\nlabour and the midnight oil we have spent on our studies wasted by\r\nweeping over them. Heaven help us! I derive consolation not so much from\r\nhope, as I did formerly, as from a spirit of indifference, which I call\r\nto my service especially in civic and political matters. Nay more, the\r\nlittle strain of vanity and thirst for fame that there is in me—it is a\r\ngood thing to recognize one’s own faults—even experiences a pleasurable\r\nsensation. For the thought that the Pasha’s services to the country\r\nmight in the dim future be reckoned higher than mine, used to prick me\r\nto the heart: but now I rest quite easy on that score. He has fallen so\r\nlow that the fallen Curius in comparison seems to stand erect. But of\r\nthis when we meet.

We are hemmed in on every\r\nside; yet we do not rebel at servitude, fearing death and exile as\r\nthough they were greater evils, whereas they are really far lesser\r\nevils. Yes, that is the position, and though every one groans about it,\r\nnot a voice is raised to relieve it. The object, I presume, of those who\r\nhold the reins is to leave nothing for anyone else to give away. One man\r\nonly opens his mouth and opposes them publicly, and that is young Curio.\r\nThe loyal party cheers him loudly, greets him in the forum with the\r\nhighest respect, and shows its good-will to him in many other ways,\r\nwhile Fufius is pursued with shouts and jeers and hisses. But this\r\nraises not one’s hope so much as one’s disgust at seeing the people’s\r\nwill so free and their courage so enslaved. And, not to enter into\r\ndetails with you, affairs have come to such a pass that there is no hope\r\nof ever again having free magistrates, let alone a free people. But in\r\nthe midst of this tyranny speech is freer than ever, at any rate in\r\nclubs and over our\r\n\r\net in conviviis est liberior quam fuit. Vincere incipit timorem dolor,\r\nsed ita, ut omnia sint plenissima desperationis. Habet etiam Campana lex\r\nexsecrationem candidatorum, si mentionem in contione fecerint, quo\r\naliter ager possideatur atque ut ex legibus Iuliis. Non dubitant iurare\r\nceteri; Laterensis existimatur laute fecisse, quod tribunatum pl. petere\r\ndestitit, ne iuraret.\r\n\r\nSed de re publica non libet plura scribere. Displiceo mihi nec sine\r\nsummo scribo dolore. Me tueor ut oppressis omnibus non demisse, ut\r\ntantis rebus gestis parum fortiter. A Caesare valde liberaliter invitor\r\nin legationem illam, sibi ut sim legatus, atque etiam libera legatio\r\nvoti causa datur. Sed haec et praesidii apud pudorem Pulchelli non habet\r\nsatis et a fratris adventu me ablegat, illa et munitior est et non\r\nimpedit, quo minus adsim, cum velim. Hanc ego teneo, sed usurum me non\r\nputo, neque tamen scit quisquam. Non lubet fugere, aveo pugnare. Magna\r\nsunt hominum studia. Sed nihil adfirmo; tu hoc silebis.\r\n\r\nDe Statio manu misso et non nullis aliis rebus angor equidem, sed iam\r\nprorsus occallui. Tu vellem\r\n\r\ncups. Disgust is beginning to conquer fear, though it still leaves the\r\nblankest despair everywhere. The Campanian law goes so far as to impose\r\nupon candidates a formula of execration upon themselves if they propose\r\nany different occupation of the land to that laid down by the Julian\r\nlaws, to be used by them in their speech as candidates. The others\r\nshowed no compunction in taking the oath: but Laterensis is thought a\r\nhero because he threw up his candidature for the tribunate rather than\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\nI have no heart to write more about politics. I am disgusted with myself\r\nand it is agony to me to write. I stand my ground without losing\r\nself-respect considering the universal servility, but with less courage\r\nthan I could wish considering my past record. Caesar most liberally\r\ninvites me to take a place on his personal staff: and I even have an\r\noffer of a free travelling pass nominally to fulfil a vow.[81] But it is\r\nhardly safe to trust to that Beauty’s delicacy to that extent. Besides\r\nit would mean that I should not be here for my brother’s return. The\r\nother post is much safer, and does not prevent me from being here when I\r\nwish. The free pass I have, but I don’t think I shall use it. No one\r\nknows of it however. I don’t want to run away; I long to fight. I have\r\nplenty of ardent admirers. But I won’t take my oath on anything, and\r\nplease don’t mention what I’ve said.\r\n\r\nI am much distressed about the manumission of Statius and some other\r\nthings, but I’ve become thick-skinned by now.

But nothing annoys me more than Statius’ manumission:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terence, _Phorm._ 232]\r\n\r\n             That my authority—nay, I let that be—\r\n             That my displeasure should be counted nought!\r\n\r\nBut what I am to do, I don’t know; and the matter is more talk than\r\nanything. I can never be angry with those I really love: I can only feel\r\nsorrow, and very deep sorrow too. My other cares are for important\r\nmatters. Clodius’ threats and the struggle I have to face do not affect\r\nme much: for I think I can face the music with dignity or avoid the\r\ndanger without unpleasantness. Perhaps you will say: “Hang dignity. It’s\r\nprehistoric.[82] For mercy’s sake look after your safety,” Alas! Why\r\naren’t you here? You would notice everything: while I perhaps am blinded\r\nby my passion for high ideals. Nothing was ever so scandalous, so\r\ndisgraceful, and so objectionable to every rank and class of men young\r\nor old as this present state of affairs, far more so than I expected,\r\nnay upon my soul it is more so than I could wish.

Nam et eius modi sunt ii\r\nversus, uti in tempus ab inimico Pompei scripti esse videantur:\r\n\r\n                 “Si neque leges neque mores cogunt—,”\r\n\r\net cetera magno cum fremitu et clamore sunt dicta. Caesar cum venisset\r\nmortuo plausu, Curio filius est insecutus. Huic ita plausum est, ut\r\nsalva re publica Pompeio plaudi solebat. Tulit Caesar graviter. Litterae\r\nCapuam ad Pompeium volare dicebantur. Inimici\r\n\r\nmoderate men to hiss. Bibulus is exalted to the sky, though I don’t know\r\nwhy. However he is as much bepraised as though\r\n\r\n             “His wise delay alone did save the state.”[83]\r\n\r\nTo my infinite sorrow, my pet, Pompey, has shattered his own reputation.\r\nThey have no hold on anyone by affection: and I am afraid they may find\r\nit necessary to try the effect of fear. I do not quarrel with them on\r\naccount of my friendship for him, though I refrain from showing approval\r\nnot to stultify all my previous actions. I keep to the high-road. The\r\npopular feeling can be seen best in the theatre and at public\r\nexhibitions. For at the gladiatorial show both the leader[84] and his\r\nassociates were overwhelmed with hisses: at the games in honour of\r\nApollo the actor Diphilus made an impertinent attack on Pompey, “By our\r\nmisfortunes thou art Great,” which was encored again and again. “A time\r\nwill come when thou wilt rue that might” he declaimed amid the cheers of\r\nthe whole audience, and so on with the rest. For indeed the verses do\r\nlook as though they had been written for the occasion by an enemy of\r\nPompey: “If neither law nor custom can constrain,” etc. was received\r\nwith a tremendous uproar and outcry. At Caesar’s entry the applause\r\ndwindled away; but young Curio who followed was applauded as Pompey used\r\nto be when the constitution was still sound. Caesar was much annoyed:\r\nand it is said a letter flew post haste to Pompey at Capua.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  So Ennius speaking of Q. Fabius Maximus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Probably Pompey, Caesar being the chief of the _socii_, though some\r\n  take it to refer to Gabinius, who gave the show, or to Caesar.\r\n\r\nerant equitibus, qui Curioni stantes plauserant, hostes omnibus; Rosciae\r\nlegi, etiam frumentariae minitabantur. Sane res erat perturbata. Equidem\r\nmalueram, quod erat susceptum ab illis, silentio transiri, sed vereor,\r\nne non liceat. Non ferunt homines, quod videtur esse tamen ferendum; sed\r\nest iam una vox omnium magis odio firmata quam praesidio.\r\n\r\nNoster autem Publius mihi minitatur, inimicus est. Impendet negotium, ad\r\nquod tu scilicet advolabis. Videor mihi nostrum illum consularem\r\nexercitum bonorum omnium, etiam satis bonorum habere firmissimum.\r\nPompeius significat studium erga me non mediocre; idem adfirmat verbum\r\nde me illum non esse facturum; in quo non me ille fallit, sed ipse\r\nfallitur. Cosconio mortuo sum in eius locum invitatus. Id erat vocari in\r\nlocum mortui. Nihil me turpius apud homines fuisset neque vero ad istam\r\nipsam ἀσφάλειαν quicquam alienius. Sunt enim illi apud bonos invidiosi,\r\nego apud improbos meam retinuissem invidiam, alienam adsumpsissem.\r\nCaesar me sibi vult esse legatum. Honestior declinatio haec periculi;\r\nsed ego hoc non repudio. Quid ergo est? pugnare malo. Nihil tamen certi.\r\nIterum dico “utinam adesses!” Sed tamen, si erit necesse, arcessemus\r\n\r\nThey are annoyed with the knights who stood up and clapped Curio, and\r\ntheir hand is against every man’s. They are threatening the Roscian law\r\nand even the corn law. Things are in a most disturbed condition. I used\r\nto think it would be best silently to ignore their doings, but I am\r\nafraid that will be impossible. The public cannot put up with things,\r\nand yet it looks as though they would have to put up with them. The\r\nwhole people speak now with one voice, but the unanimity has no\r\nfoundation but common hate.\r\n\r\nAnyhow our friend Publius is threatening me and making hostile advances:\r\nthere is trouble ahead, and you must fly to the rescue. I think I have\r\nat my back the same firm bodyguard of all the sound men and even the\r\nmoderately sound, as I had in my consulship. The affection Pompey shows\r\nme is more than ordinary. He declares Clodius will not say a word\r\nagainst me: but there he is deceiving himself not me. I have been asked\r\nto fill Cosconius’ place[85] now he is dead. That would be stepping into\r\na dead man’s shoes, with a vengeance! I should disgrace myself utterly\r\nin the world’s eyes: and nothing could be more opposed to the state of\r\nsafety you keep talking of. For that board is unpopular with the loyal\r\nparty, and so I should keep my unpopularity with the disloyal and take\r\nup another’s burden too. Caesar wants me to go as his lieutenant. That\r\nwould be a more honourable way of getting out of danger. But I don’t\r\nwant to shirk it, for the very good reason that I prefer fighting.\r\nHowever nothing is settled, I repeat, I wish you were here.

Here I am cultivating Caecilius and paying him\r\nelaborate attention. I hear Bibulus’ edicts have been sent to you.\r\nPompey is blazing with wrath and indignation at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XX\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, July_, B.C. _59_]\r\n\r\nI have done all I could for Anicatus, knowing you wanted me to do so,\r\nand have willingly adopted Numestius as a friend on the strength of the\r\nearnest recommendation in your letter. To Caecilius I take care to pay\r\nevery suitable attention. Varro is as good as I can expect; and Pompey\r\nshows me friendship and affection. Can I believe him, you ask. I do\r\nbelieve him; he quite convinces me. But since men of the world are\r\nalways advising one in their histories and precepts and even in their\r\nverses to beware and forbidding one to believe, I do the one and beware,\r\nbut to the other—not to believe—I cannot persuade myself. Clodius is\r\nstill threatening me with danger, while Pompey asserts that there is no\r\ndanger. He swears it, adding even that he will not see me injured if it\r\ncosts him his life.

So in future, if I have to\r\nwrite in fuller detail to you, I shall hide my meaning under covert\r\nlanguage. Now the State is dying of a new disease. The measures that\r\nhave been passed cause universal discontent and grumbling and\r\nindignation: there is no disagreement on the point and people are now\r\nventing their opinion and their disapproval openly and loudly, yet no\r\nremedy is applied. Resistance seems impossible without bloodshed: nor\r\ncan we see any other end to concession except destruction. Bibulus is\r\nexalted to the skies amid universal admiration and popularity. His\r\nedicts and speeches are copied out and read. He has attained the height\r\nof glory in quite a novel way. Nothing is so popular now as hatred of\r\nthe popular party. I have my fears about the issue of all this. But I\r\nwill write more clearly, if I get any definite views. Do you, if your\r\naffection for me is as real as I know it to be, hold yourself ready to\r\nrun to my call, when it comes. But I am doing my best, and will continue\r\nto do it, to prevent any necessity. I said I would call you Furius in my\r\nletters, but there is no need to alter your name.

I am going to\r\ncopy the work out and send it back.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXI\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS; GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, between July 25 and Oct. 18_, B.C. _59_]\r\n\r\nTo enter into details about politics would be superfluous. The whole\r\ncountry has gone to rack and ruin: and affairs are in one respect worse\r\nthan when you left. Then it looked as though we were oppressed with a\r\ntyranny which was popular with the lower classes, and, though annoying\r\nto the upper, still comparatively harmless: but now it has become\r\nsuddenly so universally detested that I tremble for the issue. For we\r\nhave had an experience of the wrath and recklessness of the Triumvirs,\r\nand in their indignation with Cato, they have ruined the state. The\r\npoisons they used seemed to be so slow that I thought we could die\r\npainlessly. But now I am afraid they have been roused to energy by the\r\nhisses of the crowd, the talk of the loyalists, and the murmurs of\r\nItaly. I had hopes, as I used often to say to you, that the wheel of\r\nstate had turned so smoothly that we could\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  10,000,000 sesterces.

Tyrrell\r\n  therefore suggests _centum_, _i.e_. 100,000 sesterces, about £880.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Not Vibius himself, but Alexander of Ephesus, author of a\r\n  Cosmographia; cf. Att.

Sed, cum diu\r\nocculte suspirassent, postea iam gemere, ad extremum vero loqui omnes et\r\nclamare coeperunt. Itaque ille amicus noster insolens infamiae, semper\r\nin laude versatus, circumfluens gloria, deformatus corpore, fractus\r\nanimo, quo se conferat, nescit; progressum praecipitem, inconstantem\r\nreditum videt; bonos inimicos habet, improbos ipsos non amicos.\r\n\r\nAc vide mollitiem animi. Non tenui lacrimas; cum illum a. d. VIII Kal.\r\nSextiles vidi de edictis Bibuli contionantem. Qui antea solitus esset\r\niactare se magnificentissime illo in loco summo cum amore populi,\r\ncunctis faventibus, ut ille tum humilis, ut demissus erat, ut ipse etiam\r\nsibi, non iis solum, qui aderant, displicebat! O spectaculum uni Crasso\r\niucundum, ceteris non item! Nam, quia deciderat ex astris, lapsus quam\r\nprogressus potius videbatur, et, ut Apelles, si Venerem, aut Protogenes,\r\nsi Ialysum illum suum caeno oblitum videret, magnum, credo, acciperet\r\ndolorem, sic ego hunc omnibus a me pictum et politum artis coloribus\r\nsubito deformatum non sine magno dolore vidi. Quamquam nemo putabat\r\npropter Clodianum negotium me illi amicum esse debere, tamen tantus fuit\r\namor, ut exhauriri nulla posset\r\n\r\nscarcely catch the sound of its motion, and scarcely see the track of\r\nits path: and that is what would have happened, if people could only\r\nhave waited for the storm to pass. But for a while they stifled their\r\nsighs; then they began to groan aloud; and finally all set about airing\r\ntheir grievances at the top of their voices. And so our friend, being\r\nunused to unpopularity, and having always lived in an atmosphere of\r\nflattery and glory, disfigured in person and broken in spirit, does not\r\nknow what to do with himself: he sees that to advance is dangerous, to\r\nretreat a confession of weakness: the respectable parties are his\r\nenemies, the very riff-raff not his friends.\r\n\r\nYet see how soft-hearted I am. I could not restrain my tears, when I saw\r\nhim on the 25th of July delivering a speech on the subject of the edicts\r\nof Bibulus. He used to carry himself with such a lofty bearing, enjoying\r\nunbounded popularity and universal respect: and now, how humble he was,\r\nhow cast down, and what discontent he aroused in himself as well as in\r\nhis hearers! What a sight! Crassus may have enjoyed it, but no one else.\r\nFor seeing that he had fallen from the stars, one could not but\r\nattribute his swift descent to accident rather than to voluntary motion.\r\nAnd, just as Apelles or Protogenes, if they had seen their Venus or\r\nIalysus smeared with mud, would, I imagine, have been cut to the heart,\r\nso I myself could not but feel poignant grief at seeing the idol on\r\nwhose adornment I had lavished all the colours of my art suddenly\r\ndisfigured. For though no one looked on it as my duty to retain my\r\nfriendship with him after the Clodian affair, my affection for him was\r\nsuch that no slight could extinguish\r\n\r\niniuria. Itaque Archilochia in illum edicta Bibuli populo ita sunt\r\niucunda, ut eum locum, ubi proponuntur, prae multitudine eorum, qui\r\nlegunt, transire nequeamus, ipsi ita acerba, ut tabescat dolore, mihi\r\nmehercule molesta, quod et eum, quem semper dilexi, nimis excruciant, et\r\ntimeo, tam vehemens vir tamque acer in ferro et tam insuetus contumeliae\r\nne omni animi impetu dolori et iracundiae pareat.\r\n\r\nBibuli qui sit exitus futurus, nescio. Ut nunc res se habet, admirabili\r\ngloria est. Qui cum comitia in mensem Octobrem distulisset, quod solet\r\nea res populi voluntatem offendere, putarat Caesar oratione sua posse\r\nimpelli contionem, ut iret ad Bibulum; multa cum seditiosissime diceret,\r\nvocem exprimere non potuit. Quid quaeris? sentiunt se nullam ullius\r\npartis voluntatem tenere. Eo magis vis nobis est timenda.\r\n\r\nClodius inimicus est nobis. Pompeius confirmat eum nihil esse facturum\r\ncontra me. Mihi periculosum est credere, ad resistendum me paro. Studia\r\nspero me summa habiturum omnium ordinum. Te cum ego desidero, tum vero\r\nres ad tempus illud vocat. Plurimum consilii, animi, praesidii denique\r\nmihi, si te ad tempus videro, accesserit. Varro mihi satis facit.\r\nPompeius loquitur divinitus. Spero nos aut certe cum summa gloria aut\r\netiam sine molestia discessuros. Tu quid agas, quem ad modum te\r\noblectes, quid cum Sicyoniis egeris, ut sciam, cura.\r\n\r\nit. The result, is that now Bibulus’ scathing[90] edicts against him are\r\nso popular, that one can’t pass the place where they are posted up for\r\nthe crowd of people reading them. Pompey finds them so distressing that\r\nhe is wasting away with grief; and I myself am much annoyed with them,\r\npartly because they cause so much pain to a man whom I have always\r\nloved, and partly for fear that being so impulsive and ready to draw the\r\nsword, as well as so unused to abuse, he may give full reins to his\r\nindignation and wrath.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what will be the end of Bibulus. As things stand at present\r\nhis reputation is extraordinarily high. When he put off the elections\r\ntill October, which generally annoys the populace, Caesar thought he\r\ncould induce the people by a speech to attack Bibulus: but in spite of\r\nall his seditious talk, he could not ring a word out of anybody. In\r\nshort they feel that they have lost the good-will of all parties: and so\r\nviolent action on their part is all the more to be feared.\r\n\r\nClodius is hostile to me. Pompey assures me he will do nothing against\r\nme: but I am afraid to trust him and am getting ready for resistance. I\r\nhope I shall have very strong support from all classes. For your\r\npresence I have a longing myself and circumstances call for it to meet\r\nthe crisis. If I see you in time, I shall feel it a great accession to\r\nmy policy, my courage and my safety. Varro is very obliging; and Pompey\r\ntalks like an angel. I hope that in the end I shall either be certain of\r\na glorious victory, or even escape unmolested. Let me know what you are\r\ndoing, how you are enjoying yourself, and what has happened as regards\r\nthe Sicyonians.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  Archilochus was a Greek poet of Paros, who wrote scathing iambic\r\n  verses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXII\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

You would certainly have stayed, if we had\r\nthought this was going to happen. For then we could have easily kept\r\nthat little Beauty in order or at any rate should have known what he was\r\ngoing to do. As it is he flits about in a frenzy and doesn’t know what\r\nhe is doing; he threatens lots of people, but will probably do whatever\r\nturns up. When he sees the general abhorrence of the present state of\r\naffairs he seems to meditate an attack on the authors of it; but when he\r\nremembers the armed force behind them, he turns his wrath against the\r\nloyalists. As for me, he threatens me now with brute force, and now with\r\na prosecution. Pompey spoke to him about it, and according to his own\r\naccount—for he is the only witness I have—he remonstrated strongly with\r\nhim, saying that he would become a byword for treachery and\r\nunderhandedness, if my life were threatened by one whose weapons he\r\nhimself had forged by acquiescing in his transference to the plebs: that\r\nboth he and Appius had pledged their word for me: and that, unless\r\nClodius respected their promise, he would be so annoyed that he would\r\nmake it plain to the world that he prized my friendship beyond\r\neverything. He declared that after he had said this and much more to the\r\nsame effect, Clodius at first persisted in arguing the point at length,\r\nbut finally gave way and\r\n\r\nmanus dedisse et adfirmasse nihil se contra eius voluntatem esse\r\nfacturum. Sed postea tamen ille non destitit de nobis asperrime loqui.\r\nQuodsi non faceret, tamen ei nihil crederemus atque omnia, sicut\r\nfacimus, pararemus.\r\n\r\nNunc ita nos gerimus, ut in dies singulos et studia in nos hominum et\r\nopes nostrae augeantur; rem publicam nulla ex parte attingimus, in\r\ncausis atque in illa opera nostra forensi summa industria versamur; quod\r\negregie non modo iis, qui utuntur opera, sed etiam in vulgus gratum esse\r\nsentimus. Domus celebratur, occurritur, renovatur memoria consulatus,\r\nstudia significantur; in eam spem adducimur, ut nobis ea contentio; quae\r\nimpendet, interdum non fugienda videatur.\r\n\r\nNunc mihi et consiliis opus est tuis et amore et fide. Quare advola.\r\nExpedita mihi erunt omnia, si te habebo. Multa per Varronem nostrum agi\r\npossunt, quae te urgente erunt firmiora, multa ab ipso Publio elici,\r\nmulta cognosci, quae tibi occulta esse non poterunt, multa etiam—sed\r\nabsurdum est singula explicare, cum ego requiram te ad omnia. Unum illud\r\ntibi persuadeas velim, omnia mihi fore explicata, si te videro; sed\r\ntotum est in eo, si ante, quam ille ineat magistratum. Puto Pompeium\r\nCrasso urgente, si tu aderis, qui per βοῶπιν ex ipso intellegere possis,\r\nqua fide ab illis agatur; nos aut sine molestia aut certe\r\n\r\npromised he would not do anything to offend him. Since then, however, he\r\nhas not ceased to speak very unpleasantly about me: but, even if he did\r\nnot, I should not believe him and should continue the preparations which\r\nI am making.\r\n\r\nAt the present time I am managing things so that my popularity and the\r\nstrength of my position increases daily. Politics I am not touching at\r\nall, but am busily engaged in the law courts and in my other forensic\r\nwork: and thereby I find I win extraordinary favour not only with those\r\nwho enjoy my services, but with the people in general too. My house is\r\nthronged with folk; processions meet me; the days of my consulship are\r\nrecalled; friendships are not disguised: and my hopes are so raised that\r\nI often think there is no reason for me to shrink from the struggle\r\nwhich threatens.\r\n\r\nWhat I want now is your advice and your affection and loyalty: so fly to\r\nme. It will simplify everything, if I have you with me. Varro can render\r\nme many services, but they would be far surer if you were here to\r\nsupport them: a great deal of information can be extracted from Publius\r\nhimself, and a great deal found out, which could not possibly be kept\r\nfrom your ears: besides a great deal more—but it is absurd to specify\r\ndetails, when I want you for everything. The one point I want you to\r\ngrasp is that the mere sight of you would simplify everything for me;\r\nbut it all depends on your coming before he enters on his office. I\r\nthink that, though Crassus is egging on Pompey, if you were here and\r\ncould find out from the enemy through Juno how far the great men are to\r\nbe trusted, I should either escape molestation altogether or at any rate\r\nI should no longer be\r\n\r\nsine errore futuros.

Vettius ille, ille noster\r\nindex, Caesari, ut perspicimus, pollicitus est sese curaturum, ut in\r\naliquam suspicionem facinoris Curio filius adduceretur. Itaque\r\ninsinuavit in familiaritatem adulescentis et cum eo, ut res indicat,\r\nsaepe congressus rem in eum locum deduxit, ut diceret sibi certum esse\r\ncum suis servis in Pompeium impetum facere eumque occidere. Hoc Curio ad\r\npatrem detulit, ille ad Pompeium. Res delata ad senatum est. Introductus\r\nVettius primo negabat se umquam cum Curione constitisse, neque id sane\r\ndiu; nam statim fidem publicam postulavit. Reclamatum est. Tum exposuit\r\nmanum fuisse iuventutis duce Curione, in qua Paulus initio fuisset et Q.\r\nCaepio hic Brutus et Lentulus, flaminis filius, conscio patre; postea C.\r\nSeptimium, scribam Bibuli, pugionem sibi a Bibulo attulisse. Quod totum\r\nirrisum est, Vettio pugionem defuisse, nisi ei consul dedisset, eoque\r\nmagis id eiectum est, quod a. d. III Idus Mai. Bibulus Pompeium fecerat\r\ncertiorem, ut caveret insidias; in quo ei Pompeius gratias egerat.\r\n\r\nIntroductus Curio filius dixit ad ea, quae Vettius dixerat, maximeque in\r\neo tum quidem Vettius est reprehensus, quod dixerat id fuisse\r\nadulescentium consilium, ut in foro gladiatoribus Gabini Pompeium\r\nadorirentur; in eo principem Paulum fuisse, quem constabat eo tempore in\r\nMacedonia fuisse. Fit senatus\r\n\r\nnot be so troublesome at the end as at the beginning. That fellow\r\nVettius, my famous informer, promised Caesar, so far as we can see, that\r\nhe would get some criminal suspicion thrown on young Curio. So he wormed\r\nhis way into intimacy with the young man and after meeting him often, as\r\nevents prove, he went so far as to declare that he was determined to\r\nmake an attack on Pompey with the assistance of his slaves, and to slay\r\nhim. Curio told his father of this, and he told Pompey. The affair was\r\nreported to the Senate. Vettius was summoned before them and at first\r\ndenied that he had ever had an appointment with Curio. However he did\r\nnot stick to that tale long; but at once claimed the privilege of king’s\r\nevidence. Amid cries of “no,” he began to explain that there had been a\r\nconfederacy of the younger men under the leadership of Curio, to which\r\nPaulus at first belonged and Q. Caepio, Brutus I mean, and Lentulus, the\r\nflamen’s son, with his father’s consent; and then that C. Septimius,\r\nBibulus’ secretary, had brought him a dagger from Bibulus. The idea of\r\nVettius not having a dagger, unless the consul gave him one, and the\r\nrest of it, was too much for anybody’s gravity: and the charge was\r\nscouted the more because Bibulus had warned Pompey on the 13th of May to\r\nbe on his guard against plots; and Pompey had thanked him for the\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nYoung Curio was brought in and repelled Vettius’ assertions: and the\r\npoint for which Vettius was especially jumped on was saying that the\r\nyoung men’s intention was to attack Pompey in the forum at the\r\ngladiatorial show which Gabinius gave, and that Paulus was to be the\r\nleader, when it was well known that he was in Macedonia at the time. The\r\nHouse decreed\r\n\r\nconsultum, ut Vettius, quod confessus esset se cum telo fuisse, in\r\nvincula coniceretur; qui emisisset, eum contra rem publicam esse\r\nfacturum. Res erat in ea opinione, ut putarent id esse actum, ut Vettius\r\nin foro cum pugione et item servi eius comprehenderentur cum telis,\r\ndeinde ille se diceret indicaturum. Idque ita factum esset, nisi\r\nCuriones rem ante ad Pompeium detulissent. Tum senatus consultum in\r\ncontione recitatum est. Postero autem die Caesar, is qui olim, praetor\r\ncum esset, Q. Catulum ex inferiore loco iusserat dicere, Vettium in\r\nrostra produxit eumque in eo loco constituit, quo Bibulo consuli\r\nadspirare non liceret. Hic ille omnia, quae voluit de re publica, dixit,\r\net qui illuc factus institutusque venisset, primum Caepionem de oratione\r\nsua sustulit, quem in senatu acerrime nominarat, ut appareret noctem et\r\nnocturnam deprecationem intercessisse. Deinde, quos in senatu ne\r\ntenuissima quidem suspicione attigerat, eos nominavit, L. Lucullum, a\r\nquo solitum esse ad se mitti C. Fannium, illum qui in P. Clodium\r\nsubscripserat, L. Domitium, cuius domum constitutam fuisse, unde eruptio\r\nfieret. Me non nominavit, sed dixit consularem disertum vicinum consulis\r\nsibi dixisse Ahalam Servilium aliquem aut Brutum opus esse reperiri.\r\nAddidit ad extremum, cum iam dimissa contione revocatus a Vatinio\r\nfuisset, se audisse a Curione his de rebus conscium esse Pisonem,\r\ngenerum meum, et M. Laterensem.\r\n\r\nNunc reus erat apud Crassum Divitem Vettius de vi et, cum esset\r\ndamnatus, erat indicium postulaturus.\r\n\r\nthat Vettius should be committed on his own confession of having carried\r\na weapon; and that it should be high treason to release him. The view\r\nmost generally held is that it was a put up job: Vettius was to be\r\ndiscovered in the forum with a dagger and his slaves round him with\r\nweapons, and then he was to turn king’s evidence: and it would have come\r\noff, if the Curios had not reported the matter to Pompey. Then the\r\nsenatorial decree was read aloud to an assembly. On the next day,\r\nhowever, Caesar, the man who as praetor some years ago had bidden Q.\r\nCatulus speak from the floor, brought Vettius out on the rostra, and set\r\nhim in a place which was beyond Bibulus’ aspiration, though a consul.\r\nHere he said anything he liked about public affairs; and, as he had come\r\nready primed and tutored, he omitted all mention of Caepio, though he\r\nhad named him most emphatically in the House: so it was obvious that a\r\nnight and a nocturnal appeal had intervened. Then he mentioned people on\r\nwhom he had not cast the slightest suspicion in the House,—L. Lucullus,\r\nwho, he said, generally used to send to him C. Fannius, the man who once\r\nsupported a prosecution of P. Clodius, and L. Domitius, whose house was\r\nto be the basis of operations. My name he did not mention, but he said\r\nthat an eloquent ex-consul, a neighbour of the consul, had remarked to\r\nhim that we stood in need of a Servilius Ahala or a Brutus. He added at\r\nthe end, when he had been called back by Vatinius after the assembly was\r\ndismissed, that he had heard from Curio that Piso, my son-in-law, was in\r\nthe plot, and M. Laterensis too.\r\n\r\nNow Vettius is on trial for violence before Crassus Dives, and, when he\r\nis condemned, he will claim to turn\r\n\r\nQuod si impetrasset, iudicia fore videbantur.

For, as you know, he is an odd\r\ncreature, “all tortuous thoughts and no—”.[93] But I hold to the maxim,\r\n“A great man’s follies.”[94] However, your other friend, Hortalus, most\r\ncertainly lauded me to the skies in the most liberal, open-hearted and\r\nelaborate manner, when he was delivering a speech on Flaccus’\r\npraetorship and that incident of the Allobroges. You may take my word\r\nfor it that he could not have expressed himself in more affectionate and\r\nlaudatory terms, nor more fully. I should much like you to write and\r\ntell him that I sent you word of it. But I hope you won’t have to write,\r\nand are now on your way and quite close after the appeals in my former\r\nletter.

It is a plan, which would\r\nhave just suited me, if I could have stayed there all the time. 1 hate a\r\ncrowd, I shun my fellow-men, I can hardly bear to look upon the light:\r\nso the solitude there, especially as I am so at home there, would have\r\nbeen far from unpleasant. But for stopping on the route it is too far\r\nout of the way: moreover I should be only four days’ march from\r\nAutronius and the rest, moreover you would not be there yourself. Yes, a\r\nfortified place would be useful to me if I were settling there, but it\r\nis unnecessary, when I am merely passing. If I dared, I should make for\r\nAthens; and things were turning out right for it: but now my enemies are\r\nthere, you have not joined me, and I am afraid that town too may not be\r\ncounted far enough away from Italy. Nor have you let me know when I may\r\nexpect you.\r\n\r\nYour pleas to me not to think of suicide have one result that I refrain\r\nfrom laying violent hands on myself; but you cannot make me cease to\r\nregret our decision and my existence. What is there for me to live for,\r\nespecially if I have lost even that hope I had when I set out? I will\r\nforbear to mention all the miseries into which I have fallen through the\r\nvillainous machinations not so much of my enemies, as of\r\n\r\nquam invidorum, ne et meum maerorem exagitem et te in eundem luctum\r\nvocem; hoc adfirmo, neminem umquam tanta calamitate esse adfectum,\r\nnemini mortem magis optandam fuisse. Cuius oppetendae tempus\r\nhonestissimum praetermissum est; reliqua tempora sunt non iam ad\r\nmedicinam, sed ad finem doloris.\r\n\r\nDe re publica video te colligere omnia quae putes aliquam spem mihi\r\nposse adferre mutandarum rerum. Quae quamquam exigua sunt, tamen,\r\nquoniam placet, exspectemus. Tu nihilo minus, si properaris, nos\r\nconsequere; nam aut accedemus in Epirum aut tarde per Candaviam ibimus.\r\nDubitationem autem de Epiro non inconstantia nostra adferebat, sed quod\r\nde fratre, ubi eum visuri essemus, nesciebamus; quem quidem ego nec quo\r\nmodo visurus nec ut dimissurus sim, scio. Id est maximum et miserrimum\r\nmearum omnium miseriarum. Ego et saepius ad te et plura scriberem, nisi\r\nmihi dolor meus cum omnes partes mentis tum maxime huius generis\r\nfacultatem ademisset.

But this I will say, that no one has ever\r\nsuffered such a misfortune, and no one ever had more right to wish for\r\ndeath. But I have missed the time when I could have died with honour. At\r\nany other time death will only end my pain, not heal it.\r\n\r\nI notice you collect everything which you think can raise any hopes in\r\nme of a change in affairs. That “everything” is very little: still,\r\nsince you so decide, I will await the issue. Though you have not\r\nstarted, you will catch me yet, if you hurry. I shall either go to\r\nEpirus, or proceed slowly through Candavia. My hesitation about Epirus\r\ndoes not arise from my changefulness, but from doubts as to where I\r\nshall see my brother. I don’t know where I shall see him, nor how I\r\nshall tear myself from him. That is the chief and most pitiful of all my\r\nmiseries. I would write to you oftener and fuller, if grief had not\r\nrobbed me of all my wits and especially of that particular faculty. I\r\nlong to see you. Take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nAt Brundisium, April 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Thessalonica, May 29_, B.C. _58_]\r\n\r\nAs I was setting out from Brundisium, I wrote to you, explaining why I\r\ncould not go to Epirus, because it is close to Achaia which is full of\r\nmy most virulent enemies, and it is a hard place to get out of, when I\r\nwant to start. My decision was confirmed by the receipt of two messages\r\nat Dyrrachium, one saying that my brother was coming by sea from Ephesus\r\nto\r\n\r\npedibus per Macedoniam venire. Itaque illi obviam misimus Athenas, ut\r\ninde Thessalonicam veniret. Ipsi processimus et Thessalonicam a. d. X\r\nKal. Iunias venimus, neque de illius itinere quicquam certi habebamus\r\nnisi eum ab Epheso ante aliquanto profectum. Nunc, istic quid agatur,\r\nmagno opere timeo; quamquam tu altera epistula scribis Idibus Maiis\r\naudire te fore ut acrius postularetur, altera iam esse mitiora. Sed haec\r\nest pridie data quam illa, quo conturber magis. Itaque cum meus me\r\nmaeror cotidianus lacerat et conficit, tum vero haec addita cura vix\r\nmihi vitam reliquam facit. Sed et navigatio perdifficilis fuit, et ille,\r\nincertus ubi ego essem, fortasse alium cursum petivit. Nam Phaetho\r\nlibertus eum non vidit. Vento reiectus ab Ilio in Macedoniam Pellae mihi\r\npraesto fuit. Reliqua quam mihi timenda sint video, nec quid scribam\r\nhabeo et omnia timeo, nec tam miserum est quicquam, quod non in nostram\r\nfortunam cadere videatur. Equidem adhuc miser in maximis meis aerumnis\r\net luctibus hoc metu adiecto maneo Thessalonicae suspensus nec audeo\r\nquicquam.\r\n\r\nNunc ad ea, quae scripsisti. Tryphonem Caecilium non vidi. Sermonem tuum\r\net Pompei cognovi ex tuis litteris. Motum in re publica non tantum ego\r\nimpendere video, quantum tu aut vides aut ad me consolandum adfers.\r\nTigrane enim neglecto sublata sunt omnia. Varroni me iubes agere\r\ngratias. Faciam; item Hypsaeo. Quod suades, ne longius discedamus,\r\n\r\nAthens, the other that he was coming by land through Macedonia. So I\r\nsent a note to catch him at Athens, asking him to come on to\r\nThessalonica, and I myself set off and arrived at Thessalonica on the\r\n23rd of May. The only certain news about him, that I have had, is that\r\nhe started a short time ago from Ephesus. Now I am in great anxiety to\r\nknow what is happening at Rome. It is true that in one letter dated May\r\n15 you say you have heard that Quintus will be rigorously called in\r\nquestion, and in another that things are calming down: but the latter is\r\ndated a day before the former, to increase my perplexity. So, what\r\nbetween my own personal grief, which racks and tortures me daily, and\r\nthis additional anxiety, I have hardly any life left in me. But the\r\npassage was very bad and perhaps, not knowing where I was, he took some\r\nother direction. My freedman Phaetho has seen nothing of him. Phaetho\r\nwas driven back by wind from Ilium to Macedonia and came to me at Pella.\r\nI see how threatening the future is, though I have not the heart to\r\nwrite. I am afraid of everything: there is no misfortune that does not\r\nseem to fall to my lot. I am still staying in suspense at Thessalonica,\r\nwith this new fear added to the woes and sorrows that oppress me; and I\r\ndo not dare to make a move of any kind.\r\n\r\nNow for the things you mention in your letter. Caecilius Trypho I have\r\nnot seen. Of your talk with Pompey I have heard from your letter. I\r\ncannot see such signs of a political change as you either see or invent\r\nto comfort me: for, if they take no notice of the Tigranes episode, all\r\nhope is lost. You bid me pay my thanks to Varro. I will, and to Hypsaeus\r\ntoo. I think I will follow your advice not to go any\r\n\r\ndum acta mensis Maii ad nos perferantur, puto me ita esse facturum, sed,\r\nubi, nondum statui; atque ita perturbato sum animo de Quinto, ut nihil\r\nqueam statuere, sed tamen statim te faciam certiorem.\r\n\r\nEx epistularum mearum inconstantia puto te mentis meae motum videre,\r\nqui, etsi incredibili et singulari calamitate adflictus sum, tamen non\r\ntam est ex miseria quam ex culpae nostrae recordatione commotus.

Iun. a. 696_]\r\n\r\nQuintus frater cum ex Asia discessisset ante Kal. Maias et Athenas\r\nvenisset Idibus, valde fuit ei properandum, ne quid absens acciperet\r\ncalamitatis, si quis forte fuisset, qui contentus nostris malis non\r\nesset. Itaque eum malui properare Romam quam ad me venire et simul\r\n(dicam enim, quod verum est, ex quo\r\n\r\nfurther away, until I receive the parliamentary news for May. But where\r\nto stop I have not yet made up my mind; and I am so anxious about\r\nQuintus, that I can’t make up my mind to anything. But I will soon let\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\nFrom these rambling notes of mine, you can see the perturbed state of my\r\nwits. Yet, though I have been crushed by an incredible and unparalleled\r\nmisfortune, it is not so much my misery as the remembrance of my own\r\nmistake that affects me. For now surely you see whose treachery egged me\r\non and betrayed me. Would to heaven you had seen it before, and had not\r\nlet a mistake dominate your mind as I did. So when you hear that I am\r\ncrushed and overwhelmed with grief, be assured that the sense of my\r\nfolly in trusting one, whose treachery I had not suspected, is a heavier\r\npenalty than all the consequences. The thought of my misfortunes and my\r\nfears for my brother prevent me from writing. Keep your eye on events\r\nand your hand at the helm. Terentia expresses the deepest gratitude to\r\nyou. I have sent you a copy of the letter I wrote to Pompey.\r\n\r\nAt Thessalonica, May 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Thessalonica, June 13_, B.C. _58_]\r\n\r\nMy brother Quintus left Asia at the end of April and reached Athens on\r\nMay the 15th: and he had to hurry, for fear anything disastrous might\r\nhappen in his absence, if there were anyone who was not yet contented\r\nwith the measure of our woes. So I preferred him to hurry on to Rome\r\nrather than to come to me: and besides—I will confess the\r\n\r\nmagnitudinem miseriarum mearum perspicere possis) animum inducere non\r\npotui, ut aut illum amantissimum mei, mollissimo animo tanto in maerore\r\naspicerem aut meas miserias luctu adflictus[97] et perditam fortunam\r\nilli offerrem aut ab illo aspici paterer. Atque etiam illud timebam,\r\nquod profecto accidisset, ne a me digredi non posset. Versabatur mihi\r\ntempus illud ante oculos, cum ille aut lictores dimitteret aut vi\r\navelleretur ex complexu meo. Huius acerbitatis eventum altera acerbitate\r\nnon videndi fratris vitavi. In hunc me casum vos vivendi auctores\r\nimpulistis. Itaque mei peccati luo poenas. Quamquam me tuae litterae\r\nsustentant, ex quibus, quantum tu ipse speres, facile perspicio; quae\r\nquidem tamen aliquid habebant solacii, antequam eo venisti a Pompeio,\r\n“Nunc Hortensium allice et eius modi viros.” Obsecro, mi Pomponi, nondum\r\nperspicis, quorum opera, quorum insidiis, quorum scelere perierimus? Sed\r\ntecum haec omnia coram agemus; tantum dico, quod scire te puto, nos non\r\ninimici, sed invidi perdiderunt. Nunc, si ita sunt, quae speras,\r\nsustinebimus nos et spe, qua iubes, nitemur; sin, ut mihi videntur,\r\ninfirma sunt, quod optimo tempore facere non licuit, minus idoneo fiet.\r\n\r\nTerentia tibi saepe agit gratias. Mihi etiam unum de malis in metu est,\r\nfratris miseri negotium; quod si sciam cuius modi sit, sciam, quid\r\nagendum mihi sit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  adflictus _Reid_; adflictas _MSS._\r\n\r\ntruth and it will show you the depth of my misery—I could not bear in my\r\ngreat distress to look on one so devoted to me and so tender-hearted,\r\nnor could I thrust upon him the misery of my affliction and my fallen\r\nfortune, or suffer him to see me. Besides I was afraid of what would\r\nhave been sure to happen—that he would not be able to part from me. The\r\npicture of the moment when he would have had to dismiss his lictors or\r\nto be torn by force from my arms was ever before me. The bitterness of\r\nparting I have avoided by the bitterness of not seeing my brother. That\r\nis the kind of dilemma into which you who are responsible for my\r\nsurvival have forced me; and so I have to pay the penalty for my\r\nmistake. Your letter however cheers me, though I can easily see from it\r\nhow little hope you have yourself. Still it offered some little\r\nconsolation till you passed from your mention of Pompey to the passage:\r\n“Now try to win over Hortensius and such people.” In heaven’s name, my\r\ndear Pomponius, have you not yet grasped, whose agency, whose villainy\r\nand whose treachery have ruined me? But that I will discuss when I meet\r\nyou. Now I will only say, what you must surely know, that it is not so\r\nmuch my enemies as my enviers who have ruined me. If there is any real\r\nfoundation for your hopes, I will bear up and rely on the hope you\r\nsuggest. But if, as seems probable to me, your hopes are ill-founded,\r\nthen I will do now what you would not let me do before, though the time\r\nis far less appropriate.\r\n\r\nTerentia often expresses her gratitude to you. The thing I most fear\r\namong all my misfortunes is my poor brother’s business: if I knew the\r\nexact state of affairs, I might know what to do about it.

At present you do not\r\ngive me the least hint of anything except the disagreement of those\r\nfriends of yours: and they are quarrelling about anything rather than\r\nme, so I do not see what good it will do me. But, as long as you wish me\r\nto hope, I will bow to your wishes. You frequently reproach me strongly\r\nfor weak-heartedness: but I should like to know if I have been spared\r\nany hardship in my misfortune. Did anyone ever fall from such a high\r\nestate in such a good cause, especially when he was so well endowed with\r\ngenius and good sense, so popular and so strongly supported by all\r\nhonest men?

I did not go to Epirus as I said I\r\nshould, since all the news and all the letters that have reached me\r\nlately have shown me that there was no necessity to remain very near\r\nItaly.

My answer to the first is that though I am distressed, it has\r\nnot unhinged my mind: nay, I am even distressed that, though my mind is\r\nso sound, I have neither place nor opportunity for using it. For, if you\r\nfeel the loss of a single friend like myself, what do you suppose my\r\nfeelings are, when I have lost you and every one else? And if you, on\r\nwhom no ban of outlawry has fallen, miss my presence, you can imagine\r\nthe aching void outlawry leaves in me. I will not mention all that I\r\n\r\nsim spoliatus, non solum quia non ignoras, sed etiam ne rescindam ipse\r\ndolorem meum; hoc confirmo, neque tantis bonis esse privatum quemquam\r\nneque in tantas miserias incidisse. Dies autem non modo non levat luctum\r\nhunc, sed etiam auget. Nam ceteri dolores mitigantur vetustate, hic non\r\npotest non et sensu praesentis miseriae et recordatione praeteritae\r\nvitae cotidie augeri. Desidero enim non mea solum neque meos, sed me\r\nipsum. Quid enim sum? Sed non faciam, ut aut tuum animum angam querelis\r\naut meis vulneribus saepius manus adferam.\r\n\r\nNam, quod purgas eos, quos ego mihi scripsi invidisse, et in eis\r\nCatonem, ego vero tantum illum puto ab isto scelere afuisse, ut maxime\r\ndoleam plus apud me simulationem aliorum quam istius fidem valuisse.\r\nCeteros quos purgas, debent mihi probati esse, tibi si sunt. Sed haec\r\nsero agimus.\r\n\r\nCrassi libertum nihil puto sincere locutum. In senatu rem probe scribis\r\nactam. Sed quid Curio? an illam orationem non legit? quae unde sit\r\nprolata, nescio. Sed Axius eiusdem diei scribens ad me acta non ita\r\nlaudat Curionem. At potest ille aliquid praetermittere, tu, nisi quod\r\nerat, profecto non scripsisti. Varronis sermo facit exspectationem\r\nCaesaris. Atque utinam ipse Varro incumbat in causam! quod profecto cum\r\nsua sponte tum te instante faciet.\r\n\r\nEgo, si me aliquando vestri et patriae compotem fortuna fecerit, certe\r\nefficiam, ut maxime laetere unus ex omnibus amicis, meaque officia et\r\nstudia, quae parum antea luxerunt (fatendum est enim), sic\r\n\r\nhave lost,—you know it well enough, and it would only open my wound\r\nagain. But this I do assert that no one has ever lost so much and no one\r\nhas ever fallen into such a depth of misery. Time too, instead of\r\nlightening my grief, can but add to it: for other sorrows lose their\r\nsting as time passes, but my sorrow can but grow daily, as I feel my\r\npresent misery and think on my past happiness. I mourn the loss not only\r\nof my wealth and my friends but of my old self. For what am I now? But I\r\nwill not wring your soul with my complaints nor keep fingering my sore.\r\n\r\nYou write in defence of those who, I said, envied me and among them\r\nCato. Of him I have not the least suspicion: indeed I am sorry that the\r\nfalse friendship of others had more weight with me than his loyalty. As\r\nto the others I suppose I should acquit them if you do. But it is too\r\nlate to matter now.\r\n\r\nI don’t think Crassus’ freedman meant what he said. You say things went\r\nwell in the House. But what about Curio? Hasn’t he read that speech?\r\nGoodness knows how it got published. Axius however, writing on the same\r\nday an account of the meeting, has less to say for Curio. Still he might\r\nwell miss something, while you would certainly not have written what was\r\nnot true. Varro’s talk with you gives me hopes of Caesar. I only wish\r\nVarro himself would throw his weight into my cause; and I think he will\r\nwith a little pressing from you, if not of his own accord.\r\n\r\nIf ever I have the fortune to see you and my country again, I will not\r\nfail to give you more cause for joy at my recall than all my other\r\nfriends: and, though I must confess that up to now my friendly\r\nattentions have not been as conspicuous as they\r\n\r\nexsequar, ut me aeque tibi ac fratri et liberis nostris restitutum\r\nputes. Si quid in te peccavi ac potius quoniam peccavi, ignosce; in me\r\nenim ipsum peccavi vehementius. Neque haec eo scribo, quo te non meo\r\ncasu maximo dolore esse adfectum sciam, sed profecto, si, quantum me\r\namas et amasti, tantum amare deberes ac debuisses, numquam esses passus\r\nme, quo tu abundabas, egere consilio nec esses passus mihi persuaderi\r\nutile nobis esse legem de collegiis perferri. Sed tu tantum lacrimas\r\npraebuisti dolori meo, quod erat amoris, tamquam ipse ego; quod meritis\r\nmeis perfectum potuit, ut dies et noctes, quid mihi faciendum esset,\r\ncogitares, id abs te meo, non tuo scelere praetermissum est. Quodsi non\r\nmodo tu, sed quisquam fuisset, qui me Pompei minus liberali responso\r\nperterritum a turpissimo consilio revocaret, quod unus tu facere maxime\r\npotuisti, aut occubuissem honeste, aut victores hodie viveremus. Hic\r\nmihi ignosces; me enim ipsum multo magis accuso, deinde te quasi me\r\nalterum et simul meae culpae socium quaero. Ac, si restituor, etiam\r\nminus videbimur deliquisse abs teque certe, quoniam nullo nostro, tuo\r\nipsius beneficio diligemur.\r\n\r\nshould have been, I will be so persistent with them, that you shall feel\r\nthat I have been restored to you quite as much as to my brother and\r\nchildren. If ever I have wronged you or rather for the wrongs that I\r\nhave done you, forgive me. I have wronged myself far more deeply. I do\r\nnot write this in ignorance of your great grief at my misfortune, but\r\nbecause, if I had earned a right to all the affection you lavish and\r\nhave lavished on me, you would never have suffered me to stand in need\r\nof that sound common sense of yours, and you would not have let me be\r\npersuaded that it was to my interest to let the bill about the\r\nguilds[101] be passed. But you, like myself, only gave your tears to my\r\ndistress, as a tribute of affection: and it was my fault, not yours,\r\nthat you did not devote day and night to pondering on the course I\r\nshould take, as you might have done, if my claims on you had been\r\nstronger. If you or anyone had dissuaded me from the disgraceful resolve\r\nI formed in my alarm at Pompey’s ungenerous reply,—and you were the\r\nperson best qualified to do so—I should either have died with honour, or\r\nshould to-day be living in triumph. You will pardon what I have said. I\r\nam blaming myself far more than you, and you only as my second self, and\r\nbecause I want a companion in my guilt. If I am restored, our common\r\nguilt will seem far less, and you, at any rate, will hold me dear for\r\nservices rendered, not received, by you.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  The _Collegia_ were guilds for social, mercantile, or religious\r\n  purposes. A decree had declared some of them illegal in 64 B.C.; but\r\n  this was counteracted by a bill passed by Clodius in 58 B.C. The\r\n  result was many new guilds were formed, which he used for political\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\nQuod te cum Culleone scribis de privilegio locutum, est aliquid, sed\r\nmulto est melius abrogari. Si enim nemo impediet, sic est firmius; sin\r\nerit, qui ferri non sinat, idem senatus consulto intercedet. Nec\r\nquicquam aliud opus est abrogari; nam prior lex nos nihil laedebat. Quam\r\nsi, ut est promulgata, laudare voluissemus, aut, ut erat neglegenda,\r\nneglegere, nocere omnino nobis non potuisset. Hic mihi primum meum\r\nconsilium defuit, sed etiam obfuit. Caeci, caeci, inquam, fuimus in\r\nvestitu mutando, in populo rogando, quod, nisi nominatim mecum agi\r\ncoeptum esset, fieri perniciosum fuit. Sed pergo praeterita, verum tamen\r\nob hanc causam, ut, si quid agetur, legem illam, in qua popularia multa\r\nsunt, ne tangatis. Verum est stultum me praecipere, quid agatis aut quo\r\nmodo. Utinam modo agatur aliquid! In quo ipso multa occultant tuae\r\nlitterae, credo, ne vehementius desperatione perturber. Quid enim vides\r\nagi posse aut quo modo? per senatumne? At tute scripsisti ad me quoddam\r\ncaput legis Clodium in curiae poste fixisse, NE REFERRI NEVE DICI\r\nLICERET. Quo modo igitur Domitius se dixit relaturum? quo modo autum\r\niis, quos tu scribis, et de re dicentibus et, ut referretur,\r\npostulantibus Clodius tacuit? Ac,\r\n\r\nYou mention talking to Culleo about this bill being directed against an\r\nindividual.[102] There is something in that point: but it is much better\r\nto have it repealed. If no one vetoes it, it is by far the surest\r\ncourse. If on the other hand anyone is opposed to it, he will veto the\r\nSenate’s decree too. There is no necessity to repeal anything else as\r\nwell: the former law did not touch me. If we had had the sense to\r\nsupport it when it was brought forward, or to take no notice of it,\r\nwhich was all it deserved, it never would have done us any harm. It was\r\nthen I first lost the use of my wits, or rather used them to my own\r\ndestruction. It was blind, absolutely blind of us to put on mourning, to\r\nappeal to the crowd—a fatal thing to do before I was attacked\r\npersonally. But I keep harping on what is over and done with. My point,\r\nhowever, is to urge you, when you do make a move, not to touch that law\r\non account of its claims to popularity. But it is absurd of me to lay\r\ndown what you should do or how. If only something could be done! And on\r\nthat very point I am afraid your letters keep back a good deal, to save\r\nme from giving way to even deeper despair. What course of action do you\r\nsuppose can be taken and how? Through the Senate? But you yourself have\r\ntold me that a clause of Clodius’ bill, forbidding any motion or\r\nreference to my case, has been posted up in the House. How then does\r\nDomitius propose to make a motion? And how is it that Clodius holds his\r\ntongue, when the men you mention talk about the case and ask for a\r\nmotion? And, if you think\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  A _privilegium_ was a law passed for or against some particular\r\n  person, which was expressly forbidden by the Twelve Tables.\r\n\r\nsi per populum, poteritne nisi de omnium tribunorum pl. sententia?

Ego si tuam fidem\r\naccusarem, non me potissimum tuis\r\n\r\nof acting through the people, can it be managed without the consent of\r\nall the tribunes? What about my goods and chattels? What about my house?\r\nWill they be restored? If not, how can I be? If you don’t see your way\r\nto managing that, what is it you want me to hope for? And, if there is\r\nnothing to hope for, what sort of life can I lead? Under these\r\ncircumstances I am awaiting the gazette for August 1 at Thessalonica,\r\nbefore I make up my mind whether to take refuge on your estate, where I\r\ncan avoid seeing those I don’t want to see, and see you, as you point\r\nout in your letter, and be nearer at hand if any action is being taken,\r\nor whether I shall go to Cyzicus. I believe you and Quintus want me to\r\nkeep at hand.\r\n\r\nNow, Pomponius, you used none of your wisdom in saving me from\r\nruin—either because you thought I had enough common sense myself, or\r\nbecause you thought you owed me nothing but the support of your\r\npresence: while I, basely betrayed and hurried to my ruin, threw down my\r\narms and fled, deserting my country, though all Italy would have stood\r\nup and defended me with enthusiasm. You looked on in silence, while I\r\nbetrayed myself, my family and my possessions, to my enemies, though,\r\neven if you had not more sense than I had, you certainly had less cause\r\nfor panic. Now, if you can, raise me from my fall, and in that render me\r\nassistance. But, if all ways are blocked, let me know of the fact, and\r\ndo not keep on either reproaching me or offering us[103] your sympathy.\r\nIf I had any fault to find with your loyalty, I should not trust myself\r\nto your house in preference to all\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  _Communiter_ must apparently = me and my family.

In one of\r\nthem, posted on the 25th of October, you exhort me to keep up my courage\r\nand wait for January, and you give a full list of all the hopeful signs,\r\nLentulus’ zeal for my cause, Metellus’ good will and Pompey’s policy.\r\nOne of the others is undated, which is unlike you; but you give a clear\r\nclue to the time, for you say you were writing it on the very day that\r\nthe bill was published by the eight tribunes, that is to say the 29th of\r\nOctober: and you state the advantages you think have resulted from the\r\npublication of the law. If my restoration and this law together are long\r\npast praying for, I hope your affection will make you regard the trouble\r\nI am taking about it with pity rather than amusement. But, if there is\r\nstill some hope, please see to it that our new magistrates set up a more\r\ncareful case. For the old tribunes’ bill had three sections, and the one\r\nabout my return was carelessly worded; it does not provide for the\r\nrestitution of anything but my citizenship and my position. In my fallen\r\nfortunes that is enough for me, but you cannot fail to see what ought to\r\nhave been stipulated and how. The second clause is the usual form of\r\nindemnity: “If in virtue of this law there be any breach of other laws,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBut it is the third clause, Pomponius, to which I would call your\r\nattention. What is its object, and who put it in? You know that Clodius\r\nhad so provided that it was almost, if not quite impossible for either\r\nthe Senate or the people to annul his law;\r\n\r\nesse observatas sanctiones earum legum, quae abrogarentur. Nam, si id\r\nesset, nulla fere abrogari posset; neque enim ulla est, quae non ipsa se\r\nsaepiat difficultate abrogationis. Sed, cum lex abrogatur, illud ipsum\r\nabrogatur, quo modo eam abrogari oporteat. Hoc cum et re vera ita sit,\r\net cum semper ita habitum observatumque sit, octo nostri tribuni pl.\r\ncaput posuerunt hoc: SI QVID IN HAC ROGATIONE SCRIPTVM EST, QVOD PER\r\nLEGES PLEBISVE SCITA, hoc est quod per legem Clodiam, PROMVLGARE,\r\nABROGARE, DEROGARE, OBROGARE SINE FRAVDE SVA NON LICEAT, NON LICVERIT,\r\nQVODVE EI, QVI PROMVLGAVIT, ABROGAVIT, DEROGAVIT, OBROGAVIT, OB EAM REM\r\nPOENAE MVLTAEVE SIT, E. H. L. N. R. Atque hoc in illis tribunis pl. non\r\nlaedebat; lege enim collegii sui non tenebantur. Quo maior est suspicio\r\nmalitiae alicuius, cum id, quod ad ipsos nihil pertinebat, erat autem\r\ncontra me, scripserunt, ut novi tribuni pl., si essent timidiores, multo\r\nmagis sibi eo capite utendum putarent. Neque id a Clodio praetermissum\r\nest; dixit enim in contione a. d. III Nonas Novembres hoc capite\r\ndesignates tribunis pl. praescriptum esse, quid liceret. Tamen in lege\r\nnulla esse eius modi caput te non fallit, quod si opus esset, omnes in\r\nabrogando uterentur. Ut Ninnium aut ceteros fugerit, investiges velim,\r\net quis attulerit, et quare octo tribuni pl. ad senatum de me referre\r\nnon dubitarint, scilicet[104] quod observandum illud caput non\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  scilicet _Lallemand_; sive _MSS._\r\n\r\nbut, you see, the imprecations[105] attached to laws which are repealed\r\nare never regarded, otherwise hardly any law ever would be repealed; for\r\nthere never is a law which did not hedge itself in with obstacles\r\nagainst its repeal. But, when a law is repealed, the provisions against\r\nrepeal are repealed likewise. Though this is the case, and always has\r\nbeen in theory and in practice, our eight tribunes have thought fit to\r\ninsert a clause: “If there be anything contained in this bill, which by\r\nlaw or popular decree,” that is by Clodius’ law, “cannot now or\r\nhereafter be brought forward, whether by way of proposal, repeal,\r\namendment or modification, without penalty, or without involving the\r\nauthor of the proposal or amendment in a penalty or fine, no such\r\nproposal is made in this law.” And yet these tribunes did not run any\r\nrisks; as a law made by one of their own body was not binding on them.\r\nThat increases my suspicion that there is some trickery about it, as\r\nthey have inserted a clause which does not apply to themselves, but is\r\nagainst my interest; and as a result the new tribunes, if they should\r\nhappen to be rather timid, would suppose that clause still more\r\nindispensable. Nor did Clodius overlook the point: for in the meeting on\r\nNovember the third he said that this clause defined the powers of the\r\ntribunes elect. Yet you know quite well that no such clause is ever\r\ninserted in a law: and, if it were necessary, everybody would use it\r\nwhen repealing a law. Please try to find out how this clause escaped the\r\nnotice of Ninnius and the rest, also who inserted it, and why the eight\r\ntribunes, after showing no hesitation about bringing my case before the\r\nHouse—which proves they did not think\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Against anyone who should seek to repeal the law.\r\n\r\nputabant, eidem in abrogando tam cauti fuerint, ut id metuerent, soluti\r\ncum essent, quod ne iis quidem, qui lege tenentur, est curandum. Id\r\ncaput sane nolim novos tribunos pl. ferre; sed perferant modo quidlubet;\r\nuno capite, quo revocabor, modo res conficiatur, ero contentus. Iam\r\ndudum pudet tam multa scribere; vereor enim, ne re iam desperata legas,\r\nut haec mea diligentia miserabilis tibi, aliis irridenda videatur. Sed,\r\nsi est aliquid in spe, vide legem, quam T. Fadio scripsit Visellius. Ea\r\nmihi perplacet; nam Sesti nostri, quam tu tibi probari scribis, mihi non\r\nplacet.\r\n\r\nTertia est epistula pridie Idus Novembr. data, in qua exponis prudenter\r\net diligenter, quae sint, quae rem distinere videantur, de Crasso, de\r\nPompeio, de ceteris. Quare oro te, ut, si qua spes erit posse studiis\r\nbonorum, auctoritate, multitudine comparata rem confici, des operam, ut\r\nuno impetu perfringantur, in eam rem incumbas ceterosque excites. Sin,\r\nut ego perspicio cum tua coniectura tum etiam mea, spei nihil est, oro\r\nobtestorque te, ut Quintum fratrem ames, quem ego miserum misere\r\nperdidi, neve quid eum patiare gravius consulere de se, quam expediat\r\nsororis tuae filio, meum Ciceronem, cui nihil misello relinquo praeter\r\ninvidiam et ignominiam nominis mei, tueare, quoad poteris, Terentiam,\r\nunam omnium\r\n\r\nthat section need be taken seriously—yet when it came to repealing the\r\nlaw, became so cautious that they feared a rule, which even those who\r\nare bound by the law do not regard, though they themselves were not\r\nbound by it. That clause I would rather the new tribunes did not\r\npropose; but do let them pass something—anything. I shall be quite\r\ncontented with a single clause of recall, if only the matter can be\r\nsettled. For some time past I have been ashamed of writing such long\r\nletters. For by the time you read this I am afraid that there may be no\r\nhope left, and that all my trouble may serve only to make you pity and\r\nothers laugh. But, if there is any hope left, look at the bill which\r\nVisellius has drawn up for Fadius: it takes my fancy very much, whereas\r\nour friend Sestius’ proposal, which you say has your approval, does not\r\nplease me at all.\r\n\r\nThe third letter is dated November 12, and in it you go through the\r\nreasons which you think are causing delay in my case, thoughtfully and\r\ncarefully, mentioning Crassus, Pompey and the rest. Now, if there is the\r\nleast chance of getting the matter settled by the good offices and\r\nauthority of the conservatives and by getting a large mass of\r\nsupporters, for heaven’s sake try to break the barrier down at a rush:\r\ndevote yourself to it and incite others to join. But if, as I infer from\r\nyour guesses as well as mine, there is no hope left, then I beg and pray\r\nyou to cherish my poor brother Quintus, whom I have involved in my own\r\nruin, and not to let him pursue any rash course which would endanger\r\nyour sister’s son. Watch over my poor little boy, to whom I leave\r\nnothing but the hatred and the disgrace of my name, so far as you can,\r\nand support Terentia with your kindness in her\r\n\r\naerumnosissimam, sustentes tuis officiis. Ego in Epirum proficiscar, cum\r\nprimorum dierum nuntios excepero. Tu ad me velim proximis litteris, ut\r\nse initia dederint, perscribas.\r\n\r\nData pridie Kal.

For, if the tribunes are annoyed\r\nwith us, what hope is left? And they seem to me to have every reason for\r\nannoyance, when they were left out of the plan, though they had espoused\r\nmy cause, and by our concession they have lost all use of their just\r\nright, especially as they assert that it was for my sake they wished to\r\nexercise their powers in fitting out the consuls, with a view not to\r\noppose them but to attach them to my cause. But now if the consuls\r\nchoose to stand aloof from me, they are perfectly free to do so, while,\r\nif they take my part, they can do nothing against the tribunes’ will. As\r\nfor your writing that, if you had\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  _Ornare consules_ or _provincias_ is the phrase used of the\r\n  arrangement of the number of troops, the staff, and the amount of\r\n  money to be granted to each consul, when going he went to his\r\n  province. It generally took place after they came into office; but for\r\n  some reason it had been arranged earlier on this occasion.\r\n\r\nillos hoc idem per populum adsecuturos fuisse, invitis tribunis pl.\r\nfieri nullo modo potuit. Ita vereor ne et studia tribunorum amiserimus\r\net, si studia maneant, vinclum illud adiungendorum consulum amissum sit.\r\n\r\nAccedit aliud non parvum incommodum, quod gravis illa opinio, ut quidem\r\nad nos perferebatur, senatum nihil decernere, antequam de nobis actum\r\nesset, amissa est, praesertim in ea causa, quae non modo necessaria non\r\nfuit, sed etiam inusitata ac nova (neque enim umquam arbitror ornatas\r\nesse provincias designatorum), ut, cum in hoc illa constantia, quae erat\r\nmea causa suscepta, imminuta sit, nihil iam possit non decerni. Iis, ad\r\nquos relatum est, amicis placuisse non mirum est; erat enim difficile\r\nreperire, qui contra tanta commoda duorum consulum palam sententiam\r\ndiceret. Fuit omnino difficile non obsequi vel amicissimo homini\r\nLentulo, vel Metello, qui simultatem humanissime deponeret; sed vereor,\r\nne hos tamen tenere potuerimus, tribunos pl. amiserimus. Haec res quem\r\nad modum ceciderit, et tota res quo loco sit, velim ad me scribas et\r\nita, ut instituisti. Nam ista veritas, etiamsi iucunda non est, mihi\r\ntamen grata est.\r\n\r\nData IIII Id. Decembr.\r\n\r\nnot assented, they would have got their way all the same through the\r\npeople, that could never have happened, if the tribunes opposed it. So I\r\nam afraid that I have lost the tribunes’ favour, and that, if it is\r\nstill retained, the bond which should have united the consuls with them\r\nhas been lost.\r\n\r\nThere is another considerable disadvantage too. There was a strong\r\nopinion, or so at least it was reported to me, that the Senate would not\r\npass any measure until my case was settled. That is now lost, and in a\r\ncase where there was no necessity whatever; indeed the proceeding was\r\nunusual and unprecedented. For I do not think the estimates for the\r\nprovinces were ever passed before the consuls entered on their office.\r\nThe result is that, now that the firm resolution formed in favour of my\r\ncase has been broken for this one occasion, there is no reason why any\r\ndecree should not be passed. I don’t wonder that those friends to whom\r\nthe question was referred agreed to it: it would of course have been\r\ndifficult to find anyone who would openly oppose a measure so favourable\r\nto the two consuls. It would have been very difficult too not to oblige\r\nso good a friend as Lentulus, or Metellus, considering his kindness in\r\nlaying aside his quarrel with me. But I am afraid that, while we could\r\nhave retained their friendship in any case, we have thrown away that of\r\nthe tribunes. Please write and tell me what the result has been, and how\r\nmy whole case stands, as freely as you have before. For, however\r\nunpleasant the truth may be, I am grateful for it.\r\n\r\nDecember 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXV\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

For I grasped,\r\nto tell you the truth, that though in the advice you gave me you showed\r\nyourself no wiser and no braver than myself, and indeed, considering my\r\npast attentions to you, you were none too energetic in defence of my\r\nhonour, still, though at first you shared my mistake or rather my\r\nmadness and my unnecessary fright, it was you who took my exile most to\r\nheart and contributed most energy, zeal and perseverance in bringing\r\nabout my return. And so I can assure you that in the midst of great\r\nrejoicing and the most gratifying congratulations, one thing was lacking\r\nto fill the cup of my happiness, the sight of you or rather your\r\nembrace. When once I have obtained that, I shall certainly think myself\r\nundeserving of this renewal of good fortune, if ever I let you go again,\r\nand if I do not exact to the full all arrears in the enjoyment of your\r\npleasant society.\r\n\r\nAs regards my political position, I have attained what I thought would\r\nbe the hardest thing to recover—my distinction at the Bar, my authority\r\nin the House and more popularity with the sound party than I desire.

A qua plausu maximo cum\r\nesset mihi gratulatio significata, similis et frequentia et plausus me\r\nusque ad Capitolium celebravit, in foroque et in ipso Capitolio miranda\r\nmultitudo fuit.\r\n\r\nam in great difficulties with it and stand in need not so much of your\r\nmeans, which I know I can look upon as my own, as of your advice to\r\ngather the fragments together and arrange matters.\r\n\r\nNow, though I suppose you have had all the news from your family or from\r\nmessengers and rumour, I will give you a short account of everything I\r\nthink you would rather learn from my letters. On the 4th of August, the\r\nvery day the law about me was proposed, I started from Dyrrachium, and\r\narrived at Brundisium on the 5th. There my little Tullia was waiting for\r\nme, on her own birthday, which; as it happened, was the commemoration\r\nday of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety near your house too. The\r\ncoincidence was noticed and the people of Brundisium held great\r\ncelebrations. On the 8th of August, while I was still at Brundisium, I\r\nheard from Quintus that the law had been passed in the Comitia\r\nCenturiata with extraordinary enthusiasm of all ages and ranks in Italy\r\nwho had flocked to Rome in thousands. Then I started on my journey amid\r\nthe rejoicings of all the loyal folk of Brundisium, and was met\r\neverywhere by deputations offering congratulations. When I came near the\r\ncity, there was not a soul of any class known to my attendant,[108] who\r\ndid not come to meet me, except those enemies who could neither hide nor\r\ndeny their enmity. When I reached the Capenan Gate, the steps of the\r\ntemples were thronged with the populace. Their joy was exhibited in loud\r\napplause: a similar crowd accompanied me with like applause to the\r\nCapitol, and in the Forum and on the very Capitol there was an\r\nextraordinary gathering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  A _nomenclator_ attended canvassers and others to tell them the names\r\n  of persons they met.\r\n\r\nPostridie in senatu, qui fuit dies Nonarum Septembr., senatui gratias\r\negimus. Eo biduo cum esset annonae summa caritas, et homines ad theatrum\r\nprimo, deinde ad senatum concurrissent, impulsu Clodi mea opera frumenti\r\ninopiam esse clamarent, cum per eos dies senatus de annona haberetur, et\r\nad eius procurationem sermone non solum plebis, verum etiam bonorum\r\nPompeius vocaretur, idque ipse cuperet, multitudoque a me nominatim, ut\r\nid decernerem, postularet, feci et accurate sententiam dixi. Cum\r\nabessent consulares, quod tuto se negarent posse sententiam dicere,\r\npraeter Messallam et Afranium, factum est senatus consultum in meam\r\nsententiam, ut cum Pompeio ageretur, ut eam rem susciperet, lexque\r\nferretur. Quo senatus consulto recitato cum more hoc insulso et novo\r\npopulus[109] plausum meo nomine recitando dedisset, habui contionem.\r\nOmnes magistratus praesentes praeter unum praetorem et duos tribunes pl.\r\ndederunt. Postridie senatus frequens et omnes consulares nihil Pompeio\r\npostulanti negarunt. Ille legatos quindecim cum postularet, me principem\r\nnominavit et ad omnia me alterum se fore dixit. Legem consules\r\nconscripserunt, qua Pompeio per quinquennium omnis potestas rei\r\nfrumentariae toto orbe terrarum daretur, alteram Messius, qui omnis\r\npecuniae dat potestatem et adiungit classem et exercitum et maius\r\nimperium in provinciis, quam sit eorum, qui eas obtineant. Illa nostra\r\nlex consularis nunc modesta videtur, haec\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  populus _added by Boot_.\r\n\r\nNext day, on the 5th of September, I returned thanks to the Senate[110]\r\nin the House. On those two days bread was very dear and crowds ran first\r\nto the theatre and then to the House, crying out at Clodius’ instigation\r\nthat the dearth of corn was my fault. On the same days there were\r\nmeetings of the House about the corn supply and Pompey was called upon\r\nby poor and rich alike to take the matter in hand. He was more than\r\nwilling; and the people asked me by name to propose it: so I delivered\r\nmy opinion carefully. As the ex-consuls, except Messalla and Afranius,\r\nwere absent, thinking it was not safe to record a vote, a decree was\r\npassed in accordance with my proposal that Pompey should be appealed to\r\ntake the matter in hand and a law should be passed. When this bill was\r\nread out, the people received the mention of my name with applause after\r\nthe new silly fashion: and I delivered an harangue, with the permission\r\nof all the magistrates present, except one praetor and two tribunes. On\r\nthe next day there was a full House and all the ex-consuls were willing\r\nto grant Pompey anything. He asked for a committee of fifteen, naming me\r\nat the head of them and saying that I should count as his second self in\r\neverything. The consuls drew up a law giving Pompey the direction of the\r\nwhole corn supply in the world for five years: Messius another granting\r\nhim the control of the treasury, and adding an army and a fleet and\r\nhigher powers than those of the local officials in the provinces. The\r\nlaw we ex-consuls proposed is regarded now as quite moderate, this\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  This the _Oratio cum senatui gratias egit_, and a few lines lower down\r\n  he refers to another extant speech, the _Oratio cum populo gratias\r\n  egit_.\r\n\r\nMessi non ferenda.

Pompey says he prefers the former;\r\nhis friends that he prefers the latter. Favonius is leading the consular\r\nparty who rebel against it, while I hold my peace, especially as the\r\npontifices at present have given no answer about my house. If they annul\r\nthe consecration, I shall have a splendid site. The consuls will value\r\nthe building according to the decree of the Senate; if not, they will\r\npull it down, lease it out in their own name, and reckon up the whole\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nSo my affairs are\r\n\r\n          “For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.”[111]\r\n\r\nMy monetary affairs, as you know, are in an awful muddle: and there are\r\nsome private matters which I won’t commit to writing. I am devoted to my\r\nbrother Quintus as his extraordinary affection, virtue and loyalty\r\ndeserve. I am looking forward to your coming and beg you to come soon,\r\nand to come resolved to give me the full benefit of your advice. I am\r\nstanding at the threshold of a new life. Already those who took my part\r\nin my exile are beginning to feel annoyance at my presence, though they\r\ndisguise it, and to envy me without even taking the trouble to disguise\r\nthat.

Diximus\r\napud pontifices pr. Kal. Octobres. Acta res est accurate a nobis, et, si\r\numquam in dicendo fuimus aliquid, aut etiam si numquam alias fuimus, tum\r\nprofecto doloris magnitudo vim quandam nobis dicendi dedit. Itaque\r\noratio iuventuti nostrae deberi non potest; quam tibi, etiamsi non\r\ndesideras, tamen mittam cito. Cum pontifices decressent ita, SI NEQVE\r\nPOPVLI IVSSV NEQVE PLEBIS SCITV IS, QVI SE DEDICASSE DICERET, NOMINATIM\r\nEI REI PRAEFECTVS ESSET NEQVE POPVLI IVSSV AVT PLEBIS SCITU ID FACERE\r\nIVSSVS ESSET, VIDERI POSSE SINE RELIGIONE EAM PARTEM AREAE MIHI\r\nRESTITVI, mihi facta statim est gratulatio; nemo enim dubitabat, quin\r\ndomus nobis esset adiudicata: cum subito ille in contionem escendit,\r\nquam Appius ei dedit. Nuntiat iam populo pontifices secundum se\r\ndecrevisse, me autem vi conari in possessionem venire; hortatur, ut se\r\net Appium sequantur et suam Libertatem vi defendant. Hic cum etiam illi\r\ninfirmi partim admirarentur, partim irriderent hominis amentiam, ego\r\nstatueram illuc non accedere, nisi\r\n\r\nbusy, no press of work could be sufficient to break the course of our\r\naffection or of my duty to you. Since I have come to Rome, this is the\r\nsecond time that I have heard of a messenger, and so this is the second\r\nletter I send.\r\n\r\nIn my former I described the sort of return I had, my position and the\r\nstate of all my affairs:\r\n\r\n             “For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.”\r\n\r\nAfter I sent that letter, there followed a great fight about my house. I\r\ndelivered a speech[112] before the pontifices on the 29th of September.\r\nI bestowed great pains on the matter, and, if ever I had any oratorical\r\nability, or even if I never had before, on that occasion at any rate, my\r\ngreat indignation lent some vigour to my style. So its publication is a\r\ndebt which I must not leave unpaid to the rising generation: and to you\r\nI will send it very soon, whether you want it or not. The pontifices\r\ndecreed that “if the party alleging that he had dedicated had not been\r\nappointed by name either by order of the people or vote of the plebs,\r\nand if he had not been commanded to do so, either by order of the people\r\nor by vote of the plebs then it appeared that that part of the site\r\nmight be restored to me without sacrilege,” I was congratulated at once,\r\neverybody thinking that the house had been adjudged to me. But all of a\r\nsudden up gets a man to speak, at Appius’ invitation, and announces that\r\nthe pontifices have decided in his favour and I am trying to take\r\npossession by force: he exhorts them to follow him and Appius and defend\r\ntheir shrine of Liberty. Thereupon, though even those pliable persons\r\nwere partly lost in wonder and partly laughing at the man’s folly, I\r\ndetermined\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  _De domo sua ad pontifices._\r\n\r\ncum consules ex senatus consulto porticum Catuli restituendam locassent.\r\nKal. Octobr. habetur senatus frequens. Adhibentur omnes pontifices, qui\r\nerant senatores. A quibus Marcellinus, qui erat cupidissimus mei,\r\nsententiam primus rogatus quaesivit, quid essent in decernendo secuti.\r\nTum M. Lucullus de omnium collegarum sententia respondit religionis\r\niudices pontifices fuisse, legis esse senatum; se et collegas suos de\r\nreligione statuisse, in senatu de lege statuturos cum senatu. Itaque suo\r\nquisque horum loco sententiam rogatus multa secundum causam nostram\r\ndisputavit. Cum ad Clodium ventum est, cupiit diem consumere, neque ei\r\nfinis est factus, sed tamen, cum horas tres fere dixisset, odio et\r\nstrepitu senatus coactus est aliquando perorare. Cum fieret senatus\r\nconsultum in sententiam Marcellini omnibus praeter unum adsentientibus,\r\nSerranus intercessit. De intercessione statim ambo consules referre\r\ncoeperunt. Cum sententiae gravissimae dicerentur, senatui placere mihi\r\ndomum restitui, porticum Catuli locari, auctoritatem ordinis ab omnibus\r\nmagistratibus defendi, si quae vis esset facta, senatum existimaturum\r\neius opera factum esse, qui senatus consulto intercessisset, Serranus\r\npertimuit, et Cornicinus ad suam veterem fabulam rediit; abiecta toga se\r\nad generi pedes abiecit. Ille noctem sibi postulavit. Non concedebant,\r\nreminiscebantur enim Kal. Ianuar. Vix\r\n\r\nnot to go near the place until the consuls by decree of the Senate had\r\ngiven out the contract for restoring the porch of Catulus. On the first\r\nof October there was a full meeting of the Senate. All the pontifices\r\nwho were senators were summoned: and Marcellinus, a strong partisan of\r\nmine, being called upon first for his opinion, asked them what was the\r\npurport of their decree. Then M. Lucullus speaking for all his\r\ncolleagues answered, that the pontifices had to decide points of\r\nreligion and the Senate points of law: he and his colleagues had settled\r\nthe religious point and now in the Senate they would join the other\r\nsenators in settling the legal point. Accordingly as each of them was\r\ncalled upon in his turn, he delivered a long speech in my favour. When\r\nit came to Clodius, he wanted to waste the whole day and spoke on\r\nendlessly, but at last, after speaking for nearly three hours, he was\r\nforced by the indignant outcry of the Senate to wind up his speech. A\r\ndecree was passed in accordance with Marcellinus’ proposal with only one\r\ndissentient voice: and then Serranus put his veto on it. Both consuls at\r\nonce referred the veto to the Senate, and many resolute speeches were\r\ndelivered: “that the Senate approved of the restitution of my house,”\r\n“that a contract should be drawn up for the portico of Catulus,” “that\r\nthe Senate’s resolution should be supported by all the magistrates,”\r\n“that if any violence occurred, the Senate would hold him responsible\r\nwho had vetoed its decree.” Serranus showed the white feather and\r\nCornicinus played the same old farce: he threw off his toga and flung\r\nhimself at his son-in-law’s feet. Serranus demanded a night to think it\r\nover. They would not grant it, remembering the first of January. At last\r\nwith my\r\n\r\ntamen tibi de mea voluntate concessum est. Postridie senatus consultum\r\nfactum est id, quod ad te misi. Deinde consules porticum Catuli\r\nrestituendam locarunt; illam porticum redemptores statim sunt demoliti\r\nlibentissimis omnibus. Nobis superficiem aedium consules de consilii\r\nsententia aestimarunt sestertio viciens, cetera valde inliberaliter,\r\nTusculanam villam quingentis milibus, Formianum HS ducentis quinquaginta\r\nmilibus. Quae aestimatio non modo vehementer ab optimo quoque, sed etiam\r\na plebe reprenditur. Dices: ‘Quid igitur causae fuit?’ Dicunt illi\r\nquidem pudorem meum, quod neque negarim neque vehementius postularim;\r\nsed non est id: nam hoc quidem etiam profuisset. Verum iidem, mi T.\r\nPomponi, iidem, inquam, illi, quos ne tu quidem ignoras, qui mihi pinnas\r\ninciderant, nolunt easdem renasci. Sed, ut spero, iam renascuntur. Tu\r\nmodo ad nos veni; quod vereor ne tardius interventu Varronis tui\r\nnostrique facias.\r\n\r\nQuoniam, acta quae sint, habes, de reliqua nostra cogitatione cognosce.\r\nEgo me a Pompeio legari ita sum passus, ut nulla re impedirer. Quod nisi\r\nvellem mihi esset integrum, ut, si comitia censorum proximi consules\r\nhaberent, petere possem, votivam legationem sumpsissem prope omnium\r\nfanorum, lucorum; sic enim nostrae rationes utilitatis meae postulabant.\r\nSed volui meam potestatem esse vel petendi vel ineunte\r\n\r\nconsent the concession was unwillingly made. On the next day the decree\r\nwhich I send was passed. Then the consuls gave out the contract for the\r\nrestoration of the portico of Catulus; and the contractors immediately\r\npulled down that portico of his to everybody’s satisfaction. The consuls\r\nvalued my house at nearly £18,000[113] at their assessor’s advice: and\r\nthe other things very stingily—my Tusculan villa at £4,400 and my\r\nFormian at £2,200.[114] This estimate was violently decried not only by\r\nall the conservative party, but by the people too. If you ask me the\r\nreason, they say it was my bashfulness, as I did not refuse or make\r\npressing demands. But that is not the reason; for that in itself would\r\nhave counted for me. But the fact is, my dear Pomponius, those very same\r\nmen—you know quite well who I mean—who cut my wings, do not wish them to\r\ngrow again. But I hope they are growing. Do you only come to me. But I\r\nfear you may be delayed by the visit of your and my friend Varro.\r\n\r\nThere you have all that has happened. Now you shall dip into my\r\nthoughts. I have let myself be appointed legate to Pompey with a\r\nreservation that it should not hamper me at all. If I did not want to\r\nhave a free hand to stand for the censorship, if the next consuls hold a\r\ncensorial election, I would have taken a votive commission[115] to\r\nnearly any shrines or groves. For that was what suited my idea of my\r\ninterests best. But I wanted to be free either to stand for election or\r\nto quit the city at the beginning of summer and meanwhile I thought it\r\ngood policy\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  2,000,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  500,000 and 250,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  Cf. p. 163 footnote.\r\n\r\naestate exeundi et interea me esse in oculis civium de me optime\r\nmeritorum non alienum putavi.\r\n\r\nAc forensium quidem rerum haec nostra consilia sunt, domesticarum autem\r\nvalde impedita.

My house is being built and you know the expense\r\nand the bother it entails: my Formian villa is being restored, though I\r\ncannot bring myself either to abandon it or to look at it. My house at\r\nTusculum I have put up for sale: I can easily do without a suburban\r\nresidence. My friends’ benevolence has been exhausted in what has\r\nbrought nothing but dishonour: this you saw, though you were absent, and\r\nso do I who am on the spot: and I might have obtained all I wanted\r\neasily from their efforts and their wealth, if my champions had allowed\r\nit. In this respect I am now in sore straits. My other anxieties may not\r\nbe rashly mentioned. My brother and daughter are devoted to me. I am\r\nlooking forward to your coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, Nov. 23_, B.C. _57_]\r\n\r\nI am sure you are wanting to know what is going on here and to know it\r\nfrom me too, not that there is any more certainty about events which\r\ntake place before the eyes of the whole world, if I write to you about\r\nthem, than if others either write or tell you of them: but that you may\r\nsee from my letters how I am taking events and what are my feelings and\r\nmy general state of existence.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of November the workmen were driven out of my building-ground\r\nby armed assault: the porch of Catulus, which was being repaired on a\r\ncontract made by the consuls in accordance with a decree of\r\n\r\nlocatione reficiebatur et ad tectum paene pervenerat, Quinti fratris\r\ndomus primo fracta coniectu lapidum ex area nostra, deinde inflammata\r\niussu Clodi inspectante urbe coniectis ignibus, magna querela et gemitu\r\nnon dicam bonorum, qui nescio an nulli sint, sed plane hominum omnium.\r\nIlle demens ruere, post hunc vero furorem nihil nisi caedem inimicorum\r\ncogitare, vicatim ambire, servis aperte spem libertatis ostendere.\r\nEtenim antea, cum iudicium nolebat, habebat ille quidem difficilem\r\nmanifestamque causam, sed tamen causam; poterat infitiari, poterat in\r\nalios derivare, poterat etiam aliquid iure factum defendere; post has\r\nruinas, incendia, rapinas desertus a suis vix iam Decimum designatorem,\r\nvix Gellium retinet, servorum consiliis utitur, videt, si omnes, quos\r\nvult, palam occiderit, nihilo suam causam difficiliorem, quam adhuc sit,\r\nin iudicio futuram.

He was rushing about in a\r\nfrenzy, thinking of nothing but the slaughter of his enemies after this\r\nmad freak, and canvassing the city quarter by quarter, openly promising\r\nliberation to slaves. Before this, when he was trying to shirk his\r\ntrial, he had a case hard indeed to support and obviously wrongful, but\r\nstill it was a case: he could deny things, he could put the blame on\r\nothers, he could even plead that he had the right on his side in some\r\nrespects. But after this wreckage, arson and pillage, his own supporters\r\nhave left him in the lurch and he hardly has a hold now even on Decimus\r\nthe marshal, or Gellius: he has to take slaves into his confidence and\r\nsees, that if he openly commits all the murders he wishes to commit, his\r\ncase before the court will not be one whit worse than it is now. So, on\r\nthe 11th of November, as I was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me\r\nwith his gang. There were shouts, stones, clubs, swords, all without a\r\nmoment’s warning. We stepped aside into Tettius Damio’s hall: and those\r\nwho were with me easily prevented his roughs from entering. He might\r\nhave been killed himself: but I have got tired of surgery and am\r\nbeginning a regime cure. He realized that there was a universal outcry\r\nnot for his prosecution but for his execution, and has since behaved in\r\nsuch a way that a Catiline looks ultraconservative\r\n\r\nAcidinos postea reddidit.

Clodius, cum haberet\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  in interiora _Orelli_: ex interiorem _M_.\r\n\r\nbeside him. For on the 12th of November he attempted to storm and burn\r\nMilo’s house—the one on the Cermalus—openly bringing men with shields\r\nand drawn swords and others with lighted torches to the spot at eleven\r\no’clock in the morning. His own headquarters during the assault were P.\r\nSulla’s house. Then Q. Flaccus led forth a gallant band from Milo’s\r\nfamily house and slew the most notorious of Clodius’ troop of ruffians.\r\nHe wanted to slay Clodius himself: but he was skulking in the recesses\r\nof Sulla’s house. There followed a meeting of the Senate on the 14th:\r\nClodius stayed at home: Marcellinus behaved splendidly: and everybody\r\nwas enthusiastic. Metellus with the assistance of Appius and, mark you,\r\nyour great friend[118] of whose constancy you sent me such a veracious\r\naccount, tried the ruse of talking the time away. Sestius was furious,\r\nClodius afterwards vowed vengeance on the city, if his election did not\r\ntake place. Marcellinus posted up his resolution which he had in writing\r\nwhen he delivered it—it provided that my entire case should be included\r\nin the trial, the attack on my building ground, the arson and the\r\nassault on my person, and that all these should precede the election—and\r\nMilo gave notice that he intended to watch the sky for omens on all the\r\nelection days.\r\n\r\nDisorderly meetings were held by Metellus, wild meetings by Appius and\r\nraging mad meetings by Publius. But the end of it all was that the\r\nelections would have taken place, if Milo had not reported evil omens in\r\nthe Campus Martius. On the 19th of November Milo took up his position in\r\nthe Campus before midnight with a large force; while Clodius in spite of\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Hortensius.\r\n\r\nfugitivorum delectas copias, in campum ire non est ausus. Milo permansit\r\nad meridiem mirifica hominum laetitia summa cum gloria. Contentio\r\nfratrum trium turpis, fracta vis, contemptus furor. Metellus tamen\r\npostulat, ut sibi postero die in foro obnuntietur; nihil esse, quod in\r\ncampum nocte veniretur; se hora prima in comitio fore. Itaque ante diem\r\nXI Kal. in comitium Milo de nocte venit. Metellus cum prima luce furtim\r\nin campum itineribus prope deviis currebat: adsequitur inter lucos\r\nhominem Milo, obnuntiat. Ille se recepit magno et turpi Q. Flacci\r\nconvicio. Ante diem X Kal. nundinae. Contio biduo nulla.\r\n\r\nAnte diem VIII Kal. haec ego scribebam hora noctis nona. Milo campum iam\r\ntenebat. Marcellus candidatus ita stertebat, ut ego vicinus audirem.\r\nClodi vestibulum vacuum sane mihi nuntiabatur: pauci pannosi linea\r\nlanterna. Meo consilio omnia illi fieri querebantur ignari quantum in\r\nillo heroe esset animi, quantum etiam consilii. Miranda virtus est. Nova\r\nquaedam divina mitto; sed haec summa est. Comitia fore non arbitror;\r\nreum Publium, nisi ante occisus erit, fore a Milone puto; si se in turba\r\nei iam[119] obtulerit, occisum iri ab ipso Milone video. Non dubitat\r\nfacere, prae se fert; casum illum nostrum non extimescit. Numquam enim\r\ncuiusquam\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  se in turba ei iam _Klotz_: se uti turbae iam _NCZ_^b: si sentitur\r\n  veiam _M_.\r\n\r\nhis picked gangs of runaway slaves did not venture to show himself. Milo\r\nto the huge delight of everybody and to his own great credit stayed\r\nthere till midday: and the three brethren’s struggle ended in disgrace,\r\ntheir strength broken and their mad pride humbled. Metellus; however,\r\ndemands that the prohibition should be repeated in the forum on the next\r\nday. There was no necessity, he said, for Milo to come to the Campus at\r\nnight; he would be in the Comitium at six in the morning. So on the 20th\r\nMilo went to the Comitium in the early hours of the morning. At daybreak\r\nMetellus came sneaking into the Campus by something like byepaths. Milo\r\ncatches the fellow up “between the groves”[120] and serves his notice:\r\nand he retired amid loud jeers and insults from Q. Flaccus. The 21st was\r\na market-day, and for two days there were no meetings.\r\n\r\nIt is now three o’clock on the morning of the 23rd as I am writing. Milo\r\nhas already taken possession of the Campus. Marcellus, the candidate, is\r\nsnoring loud enough for me to hear him next door. I have just had news\r\nthat Clodius’ hall is utterly deserted, save for a few rag and bob tails\r\nwith a canvas lantern. His side are complaining that I am at the bottom\r\nof it all: but they little know the courage and wisdom of that hero. His\r\nvalour is marvellous. I can’t stop to mention some of his new strokes of\r\ngenius. But this is the upshot: I believe the elections will not be\r\nheld, and Milo will bring Publius before the bar, unless he kills him\r\nfirst. If he gives him a chance in a riot, I can see Milo will kill him\r\nwith his own hands. He has got no scruples\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  A spot between the Capitol and the Campus Martius, where Romulus\r\n  founded his Asylum.\r\n\r\ninvidi et perfidi consilio est usus, nec inerti nobili crediturus.\r\n\r\nNos animo dumtaxat vigemus, etiam magis, quam cum florebamus, re\r\nfamiliari comminuti sumus.

There I was met by Dionysius. I want to be back in Rome on the\r\n17th. When I say want, I mean I have to be in town for Milo’s wedding.\r\nThere is some idea of an election. Even if it has come off, I am not at\r\nall sorry to have missed the disputes which I hear have taken place in\r\nthe Senate. For I should either have had to give my support against my\r\nconscience, or neglect my bounden duty. But I hope to goodness you will\r\nwrite me as full a description as possible of that affair and of the\r\npresent state of politics and tell me how the consuls are taking all\r\nthis pother. I am ravenous for news, and, to tell you the truth, I\r\nsuspect everything. They say our friend Crassus made a less dignified\r\nstart[144] in his uniform than L. Paulus of old, who rivalled him in age\r\nand in his two consulships. What a poor thing he is! I have been working\r\nhard at the books on oratory: and have had them on hand a long time and\r\ndone a lot to them: you can have them copied. Again I beg you to send me\r\na sketch of the present situation, that I may not feel an utter stranger\r\nwhen I get back.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  For Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Cumano m.

But you will show your\r\nconsideration and your love for your friends by the quickness with which\r\nyou return. I am however afraid the attractions of the rhetorician\r\nClodius and the reputed deep learning of Pituanius, who just now is\r\ndevoted to Greek literature, may keep you from returning. But, if you\r\nwould prove yourself a good man and true, find your way back to us by\r\nthe date you promised. You can live with them when they get safely to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nYou say you are longing for a line of some sort from me. I have written\r\na letter full of news, with everything described as in a diary, but I\r\nsuppose it was never delivered, as you don’t seem to have stopped long\r\nin Epirus. Besides my letters are generally not of a kind that I like to\r\ngive to anyone, unless I can be sure he will deliver them to you.\r\n\r\nNow I will tell you the news of the town. On the 4th of July Sufenas and\r\nCato were acquitted, Procilius condemned. That shows us that our lights\r\nof the law care not a straw for bribery, elections, a political\r\ndeadlock, treason or the country in general. They prefer one not to\r\nmurder a father of a family in his own home; but even that preference\r\nhas no overwhelming majority in its favour: for 22 voted for acquittal\r\nagainst 28 for condemnation. Publius no doubt had awakened the sympathy\r\nof the jury by his eloquent peroration for the prosecution. Hortalus was\r\nretained and behaved as usual. I did not utter\r\n\r\ncuius modi solet. Nos verbum nullum; verita est enim pusilla, quae nunc\r\nlaborat, ne animum Publi offenderem.

After all this the people of Reate took me to their “banks and\r\nbraes” to plead their cause against the Interamnates before the consul\r\nand ten commissioners, because the Veline lake, drained by the channel\r\ncut by M’. Curius through the mountain,[147] flowed into the Nar. By\r\nthis means the famous Rosia has been dried up, though it is still\r\nmoderately damp. I stayed with Axius, who took me for a visit to the\r\nSeven Waters too.\r\n\r\nFor Fonteius’ sake I returned to Rome on the 9th of July. I went to the\r\ntheatre and was greeted with loud and unbroken applause—but don’t bother\r\nabout that: I am a fool to mention it. Then I gave my attention to\r\nAntiphon. He was granted his freedom before he appeared: and, not to\r\nkeep you in suspense, he won his laurels. But there never was such a\r\nlittle weakling with so little voice and so.... But keep that to\r\nyourself. However in the Andromache he was taller than Astyanax: among\r\nthe rest there was no one of his size. You want to know next about\r\nArbuscula: she pleased me very much. The games were magnificent and much\r\nliked. The wild beast hunt was put off till later.\r\n\r\nNow follow me to the election field. There is an outburst of bribery.\r\nMore by token, the rate of interest has risen from 4 per cent to 8 per\r\ncent since the 15th of July. You will say: “Well, I can put up with that\r\nat any rate.” And you call yourself a man and a patriot! Memmius is\r\nsupported by all Caesar’s influence. The consuls have coupled him with\r\nDomitius in an agreement which I dare not commit to paper.

Messalla is\r\nnot in the running, not that his heart or his friends have failed him,\r\nbut the coalition of the consuls and Pompey are both against him. I\r\nthink the elections will have to be postponed. The candidates for the\r\ntribunate have taken an oath to submit their conduct to Cato’s approval,\r\nand have deposited £4,400[149] with him on the condition that any one of\r\nthem who is condemned by Cato shall lose it and it shall be given to his\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nI am writing this the day before the elections are expected to come off.\r\nBut on the 28th I will give you a full account of them, if they have\r\ntaken place and the messenger has not started. If they really are\r\nconducted without bribery, which people think will be the case, then\r\nCato alone will have done more than all the laws and all the law courts\r\ncan do. I am acting for Messius, who has been recalled from his office.\r\nAppius had given him a commission on Caesar’s staff: but Servilius\r\nissued a warrant requiring his presence. The tribes he has to face are\r\nthe Pomptine, Veline and Maecian. It is a sharp struggle, however it is\r\ngetting on fairly well. Then I have to get ready for Drusus and after\r\nthat for Scaurus. These will make grand titles for my speeches. I may\r\neven have the names of the consuls elect to add to the list; and, if\r\nScaurus is not one of them, he will find himself in serious difficulties\r\nin this trial.\r\n\r\nFrom my brother Quintus’ letters I suspect he is now in Britain, and I\r\nam very anxious to know how he is getting on. One point I have certainly\r\ngained:\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  500,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nindiciis possumus iudicare, nos Caesari et carissimos et iucundissimos\r\nesse.

I have nothing to grumble about as regards the\r\nfrequency of your letters, but most of them merely told me where you\r\nwere. That they were from you showed, too, that you were well. The two\r\nof this sort which gave me the most pleasure were those dated almost\r\nsimultaneously from Buthrotum: for I was anxious to know whether you had\r\na good crossing. But it is more the regularity of this constant supply\r\nof letters which has pleased me than the richness of their contents. The\r\none that your guest M. Paccius delivered was of importance and full of\r\nmatter: so I will answer that. The first thing is that I have shown\r\nPaccius, both by word and by deed, the weight a recommendation from you\r\ncarries. Accordingly he is among my intimate friends now, though I did\r\nnot know him before.\r\n\r\nNow for the rest. You mention Varro: I will try and get him in\r\nsomewhere, if I can find a place. But you know the style of my\r\nDialogues: just as in those _On the Orator_, which you laud to the\r\nskies, I could not let the interlocutors mention anyone except persons\r\nthey had known or heard of, so here too in the dialogue _On the\r\nRepublic_ which I have begun, I\r\n\r\nquam institui, disputationem in Africani personam et Phili et Laeli et\r\nManili contuli. Adiunxi adulescentes Q. Tuberonem, P. Rutilium, duo\r\nLaeli generos, Scaevolam et Fannium. Itaque cogitabam, quoniam in\r\nsingulis libris utor prohoemiis ut Aristoteles in iis, quos ἐξωτερικοὺς\r\nvocat, aliquid efficere, ut non sine causa istum appellarem; id quod\r\nintellego tibi placere. Utinam modo conata efficere possim! Rem enim,\r\nquod te non fugit, magnam complexus sum et gravem et plurimi otii, quo\r\nego maxime egeo.\r\n\r\nQuod in iis libris, quos laudas, personam desideras Scaevolae, non eam\r\ntemere dimovi: sed fecit idem in πολιτείᾳ deus ille noster Plato. Cum in\r\nPiraeum Socrates venisset ad Cephalum, locupletem et festivum senem,\r\nquoad primus ille sermo habetur, adest in disputando senex, deinde, cum\r\nipse quoque commodissime locutus esset, ad rem divinam dicit se velle\r\ndiscedere neque postea revertitur. Credo Platonem vix putasse satis\r\nconsonum fore, si hominem id aetatis in tam longo sermone diutius\r\nretinuisset. Multo ego magis hoc mihi cavendum putavi in Scaevola, qui\r\net aetate et valetudine erat ea, qua eum esse meministi, et iis\r\nhonoribus, ut vix satis decorum videretur eum plures dies esse in Crassi\r\nTusculano. Et erat primi libri sermo non alienus a Scaevolae studiis,\r\nreliqui libri τεχνολογίαν habent, ut scis. Huic ioculatorem senem illum,\r\nut noras, interesse sane nolui.\r\n\r\nhave put the discussion in the mouths of Africanus, Philus, Laelius and\r\nManilius, adding the youths Q. Tubero, P. Rutilius and the two\r\nsons-in-law of Laelius, Scaevola and Fannius. So I am thinking of\r\ncontriving some way of mentioning him appropriately—for that I think is\r\nwhat you want—in one of the introductions. I am giving an introduction\r\nto each book, as Aristotle does in the work he called the _Exoterics_.\r\nAnd I only hope I may manage to get him in. For as you fully comprehend,\r\nI have set my hand to a subject of wide range and of some difficulty,\r\nwhich requires much leisure; and that is precisely what I have not got.\r\n\r\nWhile praising those books, you miss the character of Scaevola from the\r\nscene. It was not without good reason that I removed him. Our god Plato\r\ndid the same in his _Republic_. When Socrates called on that wealthy and\r\ncheery old soul Cephalus in the Piraeus, the old man takes part in the\r\ndiscussion during the introductory conversation; but after a very neat\r\nspeech, he pleads that he wants to go to a divine service, and does not\r\ncome back again. I fancy Plato thought it would have been inartistic to\r\nkeep a man of that age any longer in so lengthy a discussion. I thought\r\nthere was still more reason to be careful in the case of Scaevola, who\r\nwas at the age and in the state of health in which you must remember he\r\nwas, and was crowned with such honours that it would hardly have been\r\nproper for him to spend several days with Crassus at his villa at\r\nTusculum. Besides, the talk in the first book was not unconnected with\r\nScaevola’s pursuits: while the remaining books contained a technical\r\ndiscussion, as you know. In such I did not like the merry old man, you\r\nremember, to take a part.\r\n\r\nDe re Piliae quod scribis, erit mihi curae. Etenim est luculenta res\r\nAureliani, ut scribis, indiciis.

And it will give\r\nme a chance of glorifying myself in my Tullia’s eyes. I am supporting\r\nVestorius: for I see you regard it as a favour, and I make him see it\r\ntoo. But you know the kind of man he is: frightfully difficult to get on\r\nwith, even for two such easy-going people.\r\n\r\nNow for your questions about C. Cato. You know he was acquitted under\r\nthe Junian and Licinian law. The Fufian law will acquit him too, I\r\nassure you, and that as much to the relief of his accusers as of his\r\nsupporters. However, he has made his peace with Milo and myself. Drusus\r\nis being prosecuted by Lucretius. The day for challenging the jury is\r\nfixed for the 3rd of July. About Procilius there are sinister rumours:\r\nbut you know what juries are. Hirrus is on good terms with Domitius. The\r\ndecree which these consuls have carried about the provinces, “whosoever\r\nhenceforth,” etc., I do not think will have any effect.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what to say to your question about Messalla: I have never\r\nseen candidates more evenly matched. You know Messalla’s support.\r\nScaurus has been called into court by Triarius; without any great\r\nsympathy for him being aroused, if you want to know. However his\r\naedileship recalls no unpleasant memories, and their remembrance of his\r\nfather has some weight with the country voters. The other two plebeian\r\ncandidates are about equal, as Domitius is strong in friends and his\r\nvery popular gladiatorial exhibition will count for him too, while\r\nMemmius is popular with Caesar’s soldiers and relies on the support of\r\nPompey’s Gaul.

Now you must let me\r\nscold you, if you deserve it. In the letter dated from Buthrotum which\r\nwas delivered by C. Decimius, you say you think you will have to go to\r\nAsia. For the life of me I cannot see any reason why it should make the\r\nleast little bit of difference whether you act by proxy or in person;\r\nnor why you should so often go to such out of the way places. But I wish\r\nI had tackled you about it before you had taken any steps: then I should\r\ncertainly have had some influence. As it is, I will keep the rest of my\r\nscolding for another time. I only hope it may prevail on you to return\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I write so seldom to you is that I do not know where you\r\nare or are going to be. But as there was some one or other who thought\r\nhe might see you, I decided to give him this letter. Since you think of\r\ngoing to Asia, let me know when we may expect you back and what you have\r\ndone about Eutychides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XVII [XVIII]\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, Oct. 1_, B.C. _54_]\r\n\r\nI suppose you think I have forgotten my old custom and rule and write\r\nless frequently than I used; but the fact is that I have not given\r\nletters to anyone going to Epirus or Athens or Asia, unless he was going\r\nexpressly to you, because there was no certainty where you were or where\r\nyou were going. For our letters are not such that it would do no harm to\r\nus, if they are not delivered. They are so full of\r\n\r\nquidem fere committamus, lepidum quid ne[153] quo excidat.\r\n\r\nConsules flagrant infamia, quod C.

If they\r\nwere elected to the consulship, they were both to give the consuls £350\r\neach, if they did not produce three augurs who would depose that they\r\nwere present at the carrying of a _lex curiata_—which had never been\r\npassed; and two ex-consuls who would depose to having been present at\r\nthe drafting of a decree for the fitting out of the consular\r\nprovinces—though there had never been any meeting of the Senate about it\r\nat all. As this compact was alleged not to be a mere verbal compact, but\r\none properly drawn up with the sums promised on it, drafts on the bank,\r\nand many other documents, Memmius exhibited it, with all the items\r\nentered,[155] on the suggestion of Pompey. It was all the same to\r\nAppius: he had nothing to lose by it. The other has had a sad comedown,\r\nand I may say is quite done for. Memmius, however, having dissolved the\r\ncoalition against Calvinus’ will, has sunk out of mind, and his ruin is\r\nall the more irretrievable because we know now that his disclosure\r\nannoyed Caesar very much. Our friend Messalla and his fellow-competitor\r\nDomitius were very liberal to the people, and could not be more popular.\r\nThey are certain of election. But the Senate has decreed that a trial\r\nwith closed doors should be held before the elections, and each\r\ncandidate’s conduct inquired into by the panels chosen by lot for all of\r\nthem. The candidates are in a great fright: but some of the jury—among\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Or “cancelled.”\r\n\r\nVeiento, Rantius, tribunos pl. appellarunt, ne iniussu populi\r\niudicarent.

Ibi loquetur praeter\r\n\r\nthem Opimus, Veiento, and Rantius—have appealed to the tribunes to\r\nprevent their being called upon to serve without the sanction of the\r\npeople. The affair is going on. A senatorial decree postponed the\r\nelections until an enactment about the trial with closed doors was\r\ncarried. The day for that enactment came, and Terentius vetoed it. The\r\nconsuls, who were taking the matter very coolly, referred the point to\r\nthe Senate. Thereupon there was Bedlam, and I contributed my share of\r\nnoise. You will say: “Can you never hold your tongue?” Forgive me: I\r\nhardly can. But could anything be more ridiculous? The Senate had passed\r\na decree that the elections should not be held before that enactment was\r\npassed: if it was vetoed, then the matter should be brought forward\r\nagain. The law was brought forward casually; it was vetoed to the\r\nsatisfaction of the proposers; the matter was referred to the Senate:\r\nand they decided that it was to the interest of the State that the\r\nelections should be held as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nScaurus, who was acquitted in the last few days, after a most elaborate\r\nspeech from me in his defence, gave the requisite donations to the\r\npeople tribe by tribe at his own house, since all the days up to the\r\nlast of September, on which I am writing, had been rendered impossible\r\nfor the elections by ill omens announced by Scaevola. But though his\r\nliberality exceeded theirs, those who came first won the most\r\npopularity. I should like to see your face as you read this. For of\r\ncourse you have no hope that the business will be protracted over many\r\nweeks. But there is going to be a meeting of the Senate on the first of\r\nOctober, to-day, for the day is already breaking. There no one will\r\nspeak boldly except Antius and\r\n\r\nAntium et Favonium libere nemo; nam Cato aegrotat. De me nihil timueris,\r\nsed tamen promitto nihil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: vi, 8]\r\n\r\nQuid quaeris aliud? Iudicia, credo. Drusus, Scaurus non fecisse\r\nvidentur. Tres candidati fore rei putabantur, Domitius a Memmio,\r\nMessalla a Q. Pompeio Rufo, Scaurus a Triario aut a L.

You need not be afraid for me, but I won’t\r\npromise anything.\r\n\r\nWhat else do you want to know? Oh! the trials, I suppose. Drusus and\r\nScaurus are thought to be innocent. Three candidates will probably be\r\nprosecuted, Domitius by Memmius, Messalla by Q. Pompeius Rufus, Scaurus\r\nby Triarius or L. Caesar. What shall I be able to find to say for them,\r\nyou will ask. May I die, if I know. Certainly I find no suggestions in\r\nthose three books you praise so highly.\r\n\r\nHere is the other news. From my brother’s letters I hear that Caesar\r\nshows signs of extraordinary affection for me, and this is confirmed by\r\na very cordial letter from Caesar himself. The result of the war in\r\nBritain is looked forward to with anxiety. For it is proved that the\r\napproach to the island is guarded with astonishing masses of rock, and\r\nit has been ascertained too that there is not a scrap of silver in the\r\nisland, nor any hope of booty except from slaves; but I don’t fancy you\r\nwill find any with literary or musical talents among them.\r\n\r\nPaulus has almost reached the roof of his colonnade in the Forum. He has\r\nused the same old columns, but has executed most magnificently the part\r\nhe put out on contract. It goes without saying that a monument like that\r\nwill win for him more popularity and glory than anything. And so we\r\nfriends of Caesar—myself and Oppius I mean, though you may explode with\r\nwrath at my confession—have thought nothing of spending half a million\r\nof money[157] for that public work of which you used to speak so\r\nenthusiastically, the extension of the Forum and continuation of it as\r\nfar as the Hall of Liberty. We could not\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  60,000,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nnon poterat transigi minore pecunia.

And at\r\nthe same time we shall join this to the Villa Publica. You will ask\r\n“What advantage shall I derive from the work?” But we need not go into\r\nthat now. That is all the public news. For I don’t suppose you will want\r\nto hear about the lustration which is given up in despair, or about the\r\ntrials which are taking place in accordance with the Coctian law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, Oct._, B.C. _54_]\r\n\r\n... So now, to give you my opinion on affairs, we have got to put up\r\nwith them. You want to know how I behaved. With firmness and boldness.\r\nYou will ask how Pompey took things. Quite kindly, evidently thinking he\r\nmust consider my dignity until satisfaction had been paid to me. How did\r\nGabinius come to be acquitted then? It was simply a puppet show: the\r\nbehaviour of the accusers—that is to say of L. Lentulus, the younger,\r\nwho is being universally accused of collusion—was incredibly infantile:\r\nPompey exerted his influence energetically: and the jury were a rotten\r\nlot. Still 32 voted for condemnation and 38 for acquittal. Other trials\r\nare hanging over his head: he is not out of the wood yet. You will say:\r\n“How then do you take it?” Quite coolly, upon my word, and I\r\ncongratulate myself thereon. The State, my dear Pomponius, has lost not\r\nonly its sap and blood,\r\n\r\nnon modo sucum ac sanguinem, sed etiam colorem et speciem pristinam\r\ncivitatis. Nulla est res publica, quae delectet, in qua acquiescam.\r\n“Idne igitur,” inquies; “facile fers?” Id ipsum; recorder enim, quam\r\nbella paulisper nobis gubernantibus civitas fuerit, quae mihi gratia\r\nrelata sit. Nullus dolor me angit unum omnia posse; dirumpuntur ii, qui\r\nme aliquid posse doluerunt. Multa mihi dant solacia, nec tamen ego de\r\nmeo statu demigro, quaeque vita maxime est ad naturam, ad eam me refero,\r\nad litteras et studia nostra. Dicendi laborem delectatione oratoria\r\nconsolor; domus me et rura nostra delectant; non recordor, unde\r\nceciderim, sed unde surrexerim. Fratrem mecum et te si habebo, per me\r\nisti pedibus trahantur; vobis ἐμφιλοσοφῆσαι possum.

Res fluit ad interregnum, et est non nullus odor\r\ndictaturae, sermo quidem multus; qui etiam Gabinium apud timidos iudices\r\nadiuvit. Candidati consulares omnes rei ambitus. Accedit etiam Gabinius;\r\nquem P. Sulla non dubitans, quin foris esset, postularat contra dicente\r\net nihil obtinente\r\n\r\nbut even all its old colour and outward semblance. There is in fact no\r\nRepublic to give one a feeling of joy and peace. “And is that what you\r\nfind so comfortable?” you may ask. That is the very thing. For I\r\nremember its glory during the little while when I directed it, and the\r\nreturn that was paid me. It does not cost me a pang to see one man\r\nomnipotent: but those who were annoyed at my small power are bursting\r\nwith indignation. There are many things which bring consolation to me\r\nwithout my stirring from my original position; and I am returning to the\r\nlife which suits my nature best, to literature and my studies. For the\r\nlabour of pleading I console myself by my delight in oratory. I find\r\npleasure in my town house and my country houses. I think not of the\r\nheight from which I have fallen, but of the depths from which I have\r\nrisen. If I have but my brother and you with me, they may be hanged\r\ndrawn and quartered for all I care: I can study philosophy with you.\r\nThat part of my soul which used to harbour wrath has lost its power of\r\nfeeling. Now only my private and personal affairs interest me. You will\r\nfind me in a wonderfully peaceful state of mind, and upon my word your\r\nreturn is a great factor in my peace: for there is no one in the world\r\nwhose spirit so harmonizes with my own.\r\n\r\nBut now I will tell you the other news. Things are drifting towards an\r\ninterregnum: and a dictatorship is in the air. There is a great deal of\r\ntalk about it, which helped Gabinius with timid jurors. All the\r\ncandidates for the consulship are accused of bribery. Gabinius is with\r\nthem too. P. Sulla applied for the prosecution of him, suspecting that\r\nhe would be too out of pocket to bribe a jury. Torquatus applied too\r\n\r\nTorquato. Sed omnes absolventur, nec posthac quisquam damnabitur, nisi\r\nqui hominem Occident. Hoc tamen agitur severius, itaque indicia calent.\r\nM. Fulvius Nobilior condemnatus est; multi alii urbani ne respondent\r\nquidem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: xvi, 12]\r\n\r\nQuid aliud novi? Etiam. Absolute Gabinio stomachantes alii iudices hora\r\npost Antiochum Gabinium nescio quem e Sopolidis pictoribus libertum,\r\naccensum Gabini, lege Papia condemnarunt.

But they will all be acquitted, and in future no\r\none will be condemned except for homicide. That charge is being severely\r\ndealt with and so informers are busy. M. Fulvius Nobilior has been\r\ncondemned: and a number of others are polite enough not even to answer\r\nthe charge.\r\n\r\nAny other news? Yes. An hour after the acquittal of Gabinius another\r\njury in indignation condemned some one called Antiochus Gabinius, out of\r\nSopolis’ studio, a freedman and attendant of Gabinius, under the Papian\r\nlaw. He at once said “So the State will not acquit me of treason as it\r\ndid you.”[159]\r\n\r\nPomptinus wants to celebrate his triumph on the 2nd of November. He is\r\nopenly opposed by the praetors Cato and Servilius and the tribune Q.\r\nMucius, who declare that no authority was ever given for a triumph: and\r\nit certainly was given in the most absurd manner. However Pomptinus will\r\nhave the consul Appius on his side. Cato declares he shall never triumph\r\nas long as he lives. I fancy it will all come to nothing like most\r\nsimilar affairs. Appius is thinking of going to Cilicia without\r\nauthority and at his own expense.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October I received a letter from my brother Quintus and\r\nfrom Caesar, dated from the nearest point on the coast of Britain on the\r\n25th of September. Britain is settled, hostages taken, no booty, but a\r\ntribute imposed; and they are bringing back the army from the place. Q.\r\nPilius was just on his way to Caesar.

And how glad I am to hear of your\r\narrival! You have kept your promise with marvellous exactitude and\r\nfidelity. What a charming voyage! Of that I was really very much afraid,\r\nremembering the fur-coats of your former crossing. But, unless I am\r\nmistaken, I shall see you earlier than you say. I fancy you think your\r\nladies are still in Apulia. That is not the case, so there will be\r\nnothing to keep you there. You surely wont throw days away on Vestorius\r\nand have another taste of his Latin Greek after all this interval. Fly\r\nhither rather, and visit the remains of what was once our genuine\r\nRepublic. I have discussed the open bribery of the people tribe by tribe\r\nbefore the elections, and the consequent acquittal of Gabinius. Things\r\nare tending to a dictatorship, what with the deadlock and the general\r\nlicence. Observe my placidity and praise my contempt for the Seleucinian\r\nprovince,[164] and my really delightful association with Caesar. That is\r\nthe one plank left in this shipwreck to delight my eyes. Heavens! how he\r\ndoes load\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  The whole of this passage is very doubtful, and the reference in\r\n  _Seleucianae provinciae_ is unknown.\r\n\r\nQuintum meum tuumque, di boni! quem ad modum tractat honore, dignitate,\r\ngratia! non secus ac si ego essem imperator.

If one\r\ndoes not fall in love with such a man, which of the others could one\r\nfall in love with?\r\n\r\nBy the bye, had I told you I am on Pompey’s staff, and from the 13th of\r\nJanuary shall not be in Rome? It seemed to me to square with a good many\r\nthings. I need not say more. I think I will leave the rest till we meet\r\nto give you something to look forward to. My best respects to Dionysius.\r\nI have not merely kept a place for him; I have built one. In fact his\r\ncoming will add a finishing stroke to the great joy I shall find in your\r\nreturn.

That is an additional reason why you should take care that no\r\nnew decrees are passed, to prevent this painful separation from lasting\r\nmore than one year. You have taken the right steps with Annius\r\nSaturninus. As to the guarantee, please give it yourself, while you are\r\nin town. There are some proofs of ownership, for instance those for\r\nMennius’ or rather Atilius’ estate. You have done exactly what I wanted\r\nin Oppius’ case, especially in putting the £7,000[165] to his credit. I\r\nmust have that paid off without waiting till I’ve got in all my arrears,\r\neven if I have to get into the hands of the Jews[166] over it.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the line you wrote crosswise at the end of your letter, in\r\nwhich you give me a word of advice about your sister. The facts of the\r\ncase are that when I reached Arpinum and my brother had come, the first\r\nthing we did was to have a long talk about you. After that I brought the\r\ntalk round to the discussion you and I had about your sister at\r\nTusculum. My brother’s behaviour then to your sister was gentleness and\r\nkindness itself. If there ever was any quarrel about\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  800,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  _Versuram facere_ = to borrow money to pay off a previous loan.\r\n\r\nfuerat ex ratione sumptus offensio, non appareret. Ille sic dies.\r\nPostridie ex Arpinati profecti sumus. Ut in Arcano Quintus maneret, dies\r\nfecit, ego Aquini, sed prandimus in Arcano. Nosti hunc fundum. Quo ut\r\nvenimus, humanissime Quintus “Pomponia” inquit, “tu invita mulieres, ego\r\narcivero viros.” Nihil potuit, mihi quidem ut visum est, dulcius idque\r\ncum verbis tum etiam animo ac vultu. At illa audientibus nobis “Ego ipsa\r\nsum” inquit “hic hospita,” id autem ex eo, ut opinor, quod antecesserat\r\nStatius, ut prandium nobis videret. Tum Quintus “En” inquit mihi “haec\r\nego patior cotidie.” Dices: “Quid, quaeso, istuc erat?” Magnum; itaque\r\nme ipsum commoverat; sic absurde et aspere verbis vultuque responderat.\r\nDissimulavi dolens. Discubuimus omnes praeter illam, cui tamen Quintus\r\nde mensa misit. Illa reiecit. Quid multa? nihil meo fratre lenius, nihil\r\nasperius tua sorore mihi visum est; et multa praetereo, quae tum mihi\r\nmaiori stomacho quam ipsi Quinto fuerunt. Ego inde Aquinum. Quintus in\r\nArcano remansit et Aquinum ad me postridie mane venit mihique narravit\r\nnee secum illam dormire voluisse et, cum discessura esset, fuisse eius\r\nmodi, qualem ego vidissem. Quid quaeris? vel ipsi hoc dicas licet,\r\nhumanitatem ei meo iudicio illo die defuisse.\r\n\r\nHaec ad te scripsi fortasse pluribus, quam necesse fuit, ut videres tuas\r\nquoque esse partes instituendi et monendi. Reliquum est, ut, antequam\r\nproficiscare, mandata nostra, exhaurias, scribas ad me omnia, Pomptinum\r\n\r\nexpense, there were no signs of it. So passed that day. On the next day\r\nwe started from Arpinum. A festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum,\r\nwhile I went on to Aquinum: but we lunched together at Arcanum. You know\r\nhis place there. Well, when we reached it, Quintus said most politely,\r\n“Pomponia, you invite the ladies, I will ask the men.” Nothing, so far\r\nas I could see, could have been more gentle than his words or his\r\nintention or his expression. But before us all she answered “I’m only a\r\nstranger here”; just because Statius had been sent on in front to get\r\ndinner ready for us, I suppose. Says Quintus to me: “There you are.\r\nThat’s what I have to put up with every day.” You may say there surely\r\nwas not much in that. But there was a good deal: indeed she upset me\r\nmyself; she answered with such uncalled for acrimony in word and look. I\r\nconcealed my annoyance. We all took our places except her: but Quintus\r\nsent her something from the table, which she refused. In a word, it\r\nseemed to me that my brother was as good-tempered and your sister as\r\ncross as could be, and I have omitted a lot of things that aroused my\r\nwrath more than Quintus’. Then I went on to Aquinum. Quintus stayed at\r\nArcanum, and came to me the next morning, and told me that she would not\r\nsleep with him and, when she was leaving, she was as cross as when I saw\r\nher. In fact, I don’t care if you tell her herself, that to my mind she\r\nbehaved with a lack of courtesy that day.\r\n\r\nI have said perhaps more than necessary about it to show you that it is\r\nyour turn to do a little instructing and advising too. It only remains\r\nfor you to fulfil all my commissions before you start, and send me an\r\naccount of all of them, to rout Pomptinus out,\r\n\r\nextrudas, cum profectus eris, cures, ut sciam, sic habeas, nihil\r\nmehercule te mihi nec carius esse nec suavius.

While\r\nI was in my villa at Cumae, our friend Hortensius paid me a very welcome\r\nvisit. He asked if I had any commissions, and I gave him commissions in\r\ngeneral, and in particular to prevent to the best of his ability\r\nextension of my term of office in my province. Please keep him up to it,\r\nand tell him that I was much gratified at his visit, and at his promises\r\non that particular point and of any other assistance I might need. I\r\nhave bound our friend Furnius, who, I see, will be tribune next year, to\r\nhelp me in the same matter. My villa at Cumae was a miniature Rome;\r\nthere were such a lot of people in the neighbourhood. In the middle of\r\nit all our friend Rufio, seeing that Vestorius was on his tracks,\r\nbaffled the man by a ruse; for he did not come to me. You may be\r\nsurprised that he did not come, seeing that Hortensius came, who is ill,\r\nlives afar off and is a great man, and crowds of other people came as\r\nwell. I repeat he did not come. You may infer I did not see him. How\r\ncould I fail to see him when I travelled\r\n\r\nfacerem? In quo illum agentem aliquid, credo, salutavi, post etiam iussi\r\nvalere, cum me exiens e sua villa, numquid vellem, rogasset.

On a subsequent occasion, I bade him a brief\r\ngood-bye, when he came out of his villa and asked if I had any commands.\r\nIs one to reckon such a man ungrateful, or does he not rather deserve\r\npraise for not striving to get audience? But I return to my former\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nPray don’t imagine that I have any consolation for this tremendous\r\nnuisance beyond a hope that my office will not outlast a year.

Please write me on\r\nstate politics, and tell me any secrets you may scent out.

For myself I am reasonable;\r\nbut you will be away, and will any account be taken of me in my absence?\r\nFor, if either of us were on the spot, a good face might be put on the\r\nmatter with Servius through the agency of Servilia. Now, even if it were\r\na thing I favoured, I see no way of bringing it to pass.\r\n\r\nNow I come to that letter which I received from Tullius. You have been\r\nvery energetic about Marcellus: so, if a decree should be passed, please\r\ninform me: but, if not, try to carry the matter through: a grant ought\r\nto be made to me and to Bibulus. But I am confident that the decree will\r\nbe passed especially as it saves the people’s pocket. That is fine about\r\nTorquatus. As for Maso and Ligur, we can wait till they come. As to\r\nChaerippus’ request, since you have given me no tip on the matter——hang\r\nthe province! Must I trouble about him too? Well, I must take enough\r\ntrouble to prevent any debate on the matter or count out in the House.\r\nAs for others——however you do well to have spoken with Scrofa. As to\r\nPomptinus you are right. It comes to this, if Pomptinus will be at\r\nBrundisium before June, M. Anneius and L. Tullius need not hurry out of\r\nRome. As to your news from Sicinius, I am satisfied, provided this\r\nrestriction does not apply to anyone who has obliged me. But I will\r\nthink it over, as the plan pleases me. I will let you know\r\n\r\nnostro itinere quod statuero, de quinque praefectis quid Pompeius\r\nfacturus sit, cum ex ipso cognoro, faciam, ut scias.

I have received a letter from Rome, saying that my friend\r\nMilo writes complaining of ill-treatment from me, for allowing\r\nPhilotimus to have a hand in the purchase of his property. I acted on\r\nthe advice of C. Duronius, a man whom I saw to be most friendly to Milo,\r\nand just such a person as you suppose him to be. His plan and mine was\r\nthis, firstly, to keep a hold over Milo’s property for fear some hard\r\nbargainer, a stranger to us, should rob him of his slaves, of whom a\r\ngreat number were with him; and secondly, that the settlement he\r\nintended to make on Fausta should be respected. There was the further\r\nintention, that we ourselves should have the readiest means of saving\r\nanything that could be saved. Now please review the whole matter, for\r\nletters to me often exaggerate. If Milo complains and writes to his\r\nfriends, and, if Fausta wishes, as I told Philotimus and as he agreed, I\r\nwould not have him purchase the property against Milo’s wish. Nothing\r\nwould compensate for offending Milo. You will judge if the matter has\r\nbeen exaggerated. Please consult Duronius. I have written also to\r\nCamillus and to Lamia, among other reasons because I do not feel sure\r\nyou are in town.

Athens pleases me greatly, that is the\r\nmaterial city, its embellishments, your popularity and the kind feeling\r\nshown to me: but its philosophy is topsy-turvy, that is, if it is\r\nrepresented by Aristus with whom I am staying: for I gave up Xeno your\r\nfriend and mine to Quintus. Still we are close neighbours and meet every\r\nday. Please write me as soon as possible of your plans, and tell me what\r\nyou are doing, where you are from time to time, and especially when you\r\nwill be in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Athens, July 6_, B.C. _51_]\r\n\r\nWhat, write so often to Rome, and never a line to you! Well, in future,\r\nrather than do such a thing as not to write a letter that can reach you\r\nsafely, I will despatch a letter that may go astray. In the name of\r\nheaven, while you are in town, take every possible precaution against\r\nthe term of my office\r\n\r\nNon dici potest, quam flagrem desiderio urbis, quam vix harum rerum\r\ninsulsitatem feram.\r\n\r\nMarcellus foede in Comensi. Etsi ille magistratum non gesserat, erat\r\ntamen Transpadanus. Ita mihi videtur non minus stomachi nostro quam\r\nCaesari fecisse. Sed hoc ipse viderit. Pompeius mihi quoque videbatur,\r\nquod scribis Varronem dicere, in Hispaniam certe iturus. Id ego minime\r\nprobabam; qui quidem Theophani facile persuasi nihil esse melius quam\r\nillum nusquam discedere. Ergo Graecus incumbet. Valet autem auctoritas\r\neius apud illum plurimum.\r\n\r\nEgo has pr. Nonas Quinctiles proficiscens Athenis dedi, cum ibi decem\r\nipsos fuissem dies. Venerat Pomptinus, una Cn. Volusius; aderat\r\nquaestor; tuus unus Tullius aberat. Aphracta Rhodiorum et dicrota\r\nMytilenaeorum habebam et aliquid ἐπικώπων. De Parthis erat silentium.\r\nQuod superest, di iuvent!\r\n\r\nNos adhuc iter per Graeciam summa cum admiratione fecimus, nec mehercule\r\nhabeo, quod adhuc quem accusem meorum. Videntur mihi nosse nostram\r\ncausam et condicionem profectionis suae; plane serviunt existimationi\r\nmeae. Quod superest, si verum illud est οἵαπερ ἡ δέσποινα, certe\r\npermanebunt. Nihil\r\n\r\nbeing extended. I cannot describe how ardently I long for town, how hard\r\nI find it to bear the stupidity of life here.\r\n\r\nMarcellus acted disgracefully over the man from Comum:[177] even if he\r\nhad not been a magistrate, still he was a Transpadane. So Marcellus’\r\naction seems to me as likely to anger Pompey as Caesar; but that is his\r\nown look-out. I agree with Varro’s statement, which you quote in your\r\nletter, that Pompey will surely go to Spain. I by no means approve of\r\nthe policy, and indeed I convinced Theophanes easily that Pompey’s\r\npresence in Rome was the very best course. So the Greek will put\r\npressure on Pompey; and his opinion weighs with him a great deal.\r\n\r\nI despatch this letter on the 6th of July, being about to leave Athens,\r\nwhere I have stayed just ten days. Pomptinus has come along with Cn.\r\nVolusius. My quaestor is here. Your friend Tullius is the one absentee.\r\nI have some open boats of Rhodes and two-deckers from Mitylene and a few\r\ndespatch boats. There is no news of the Parthians. For the rest, God\r\nhelp us.\r\n\r\nSo far our journey through Greece has provoked great admiration, and I\r\nhave no fault at all to find with my staff at present. They seem to\r\nunderstand what my case is, and the terms on which they stand. They do\r\neverything to maintain my good name. For the rest, if the saying be\r\ntrue, “Like master, like man,”[178] assuredly they will stick to their\r\ngood behaviour,\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  He had ordered him to be flogged, disregarding the fact that Caesar\r\n  had sent 5,000 colonists to Transpadane Gaul.

Sin id\r\nparum profuerit, fiet aliquid a nobis severius. Nam adhuc lenitate\r\ndulces sumus et, ut spero, proficimus aliquantum. Sed ego hanc, ut\r\nSiculi dicunt, ἀνεξίαν in unum annum meditatus sum. Proinde pugna, ne,\r\nsi quid prorogatum sit, turpis inveniar.\r\n\r\nNunc redeo, ad quae mihi mandas. In praefectis excusatio: iis, quos\r\nvoles, deferto. Non ero tam μετέωρος, quam in Appuleio fui. Xenonem tam\r\ndiligo quam tu, quod ipsum sentire certo scio. Apud Patronem et reliquos\r\nbarones te in maxima gratia posui et hercule merito tuo feci. Nam mihi\r\nIster dixit te scripsisse ad se mihi ex illius litteris rem illam curae\r\nfuisse, quod ei pergratum erat. Sed, cum Patro mecum egisset, ut peterem\r\na vestro Ariopago, ὑπομνηματισμὸν tollerent, quem Polycharmo praetore\r\nfecerant, commodius visum est et Xenoni et post ipsi Patroni me ad\r\nMemmium scribere, qui pridie, quam ego Athenas veni, Mitilenas profectus\r\nerat, ut is ad suos scriberet posse id sua voluntate fieri. Non enim\r\ndubitabat Xeno, quin ab Ariopagitis invito Memmio impetrari non posset.\r\nMemmius autem aedificandi consilium abiecerat; sed erat Patroni iratus.\r\nItaque scripsi ad eum accurate; cuius epistulae misi ad te exemplum.\r\n\r\nTu velim Piliam meis verbis consolere. Indicabo enim tibi, tu illi nihil\r\ndixeris. Accepi fasciculum, in quo erat epistula Piliae. Abstuli,\r\naperui, legi. Valde scripta est συμπαθῶς. Brundisio quae tibi epistulae\r\n\r\nfor they will see no excuse for misconduct in any act of mine. If\r\nexample be futile, I must try severer means. So far I have been mild and\r\nkind, and I hope I am making headway. But I have looked forward to\r\nplaying patience, as the Sicilians say, for one year only. So fight for\r\nme, for fear extension of office might spoil my conduct.\r\n\r\nTo return to the commissions you have given me. Prefects have exemption\r\nfrom serving on a jury. Give the office to whom you will. I shall not be\r\nso _difficile_, as I was in the case of Appuleius. I am as fond of Xeno\r\nas you are, and I am sure he knows it. I have put you in well-deserved\r\nfavour with Patro and the other blockheads. Ister has told me you have\r\nwritten to him that you learned from Patro’s letter I was taking an\r\ninterest in the point, much to his delight. But when Patro urged me to\r\nask your Areopagus to cancel the minute they had made when Polycharmus\r\nwas praetor, it seemed better to Xeno and afterwards to Patro himself\r\nthat I should send a letter to Memmius, who had set out to Mitylenae the\r\nday before I arrived at Athens, asking him to inform his agents that the\r\nminute could be cancelled with his free consent. For Xeno was sure the\r\nAreopagus would refuse to act against his will. Memmius had abandoned\r\nhis plan of building a house; but he was angry with Patro. I enclose a\r\ncopy of the careful letter I wrote him.\r\n\r\nPlease convey my condolences to Pilia. I will tell you a secret you are\r\nnot to repeat to her: I received the parcel containing her letter, took\r\nit out, opened and read it. It was written in terms of sympathy for\r\nQuintus. Please consider the letters you got from Brundisium without one\r\nfrom me as having\r\n\r\nredditae sunt sine mea, tum videlicet datas, cum ego me non belle\r\nhaberem.

Six\r\ndays after leaving Athens I came to Delos. On the 6th of July I got from\r\nthe Piraeus to Zoster with a contrary wind which kept us there on the\r\n7th. On the 8th we reached Ceos in fine weather. From there we came to\r\nGyaros, with a wind strong, but not contrary: thence to Syros, and from\r\nSyros to Delos; in both cases sailing quicker than we could have wished.\r\nYou know by this time what the open boats of Rhodes are like, poor\r\nthings in a rough sea.

So I sit down on the high road\r\nto scribble you a summary of what really calls for a long epistle. You\r\nmust know that my arrival in this province, which is in a state of\r\nlasting ruin and desolation, was expected eagerly. I got here on the\r\n31st of July. I stayed three days at Laodicea, three at Apamea, and as\r\nmany at Synnas.[183] Everywhere I heard the same tale. People could not\r\npay the poll-tax: they were forced to sell out their investments: groans\r\nand lamentations in the towns, and awful conduct of one who is some kind\r\nof savage beast rather than a man. All the people are, as you may\r\nsuppose, tired of life. However, the poor towns are relieved that they\r\nhave had to spend nothing on me, my legates, or a quaestor, or anyone.\r\nFor you must know that I not only refused to accept pay, or what is a\r\nproper perquisite under the Julian law, but that none of us will take\r\nfirewood or anything beyond four beds and a roof; and in many places we\r\ndo not accept even a roof, but remain mostly under canvas.

There is no news of the Parthians, but chance arrivals report\r\nthat they have cut up our cavalry.

In a few days’ time I have\r\ntrusty messengers: so I reserve myself for that time. I should like you\r\nto hear the news from others; but I can’t help saying that I am\r\nconducting myself in the province with such restraint that not a\r\nhalfpenny is spent on any of us. For that I have to thank the conduct of\r\nthe legates, tribunes and praetors. For all of them take a surprising\r\npride in maintaining my good name. Our friend Lepta is wonderful.

There is no news of the presence of Bibulus in Syria: Cassius is\r\nin the town of Antioch with his whole army. I am in Cappadocia near the\r\nTaurus with my army close to Cybistra. The enemy is in Cyrrhestica, a\r\ndistrict of Syria adjoining my province. I have sent a despatch to the\r\nSenate on the situation. If you are in Rome, please look at the despatch\r\nand say whether you think it ought to be delivered: and so for my other\r\naffairs, chief of which is lest there be, as the saying goes, any slip\r\nbetween the cup and the lip,[184] I mean that I may not be burdened with\r\nan extension of office. Considering the weakness of my army, my want of\r\nallies, especially faithful allies, my most sure support is the winter\r\nweather. If winter comes and the enemy have not first crossed into my\r\nprovince, I am afraid the Senate may refuse to let Pompey leave Rome\r\nowing to fear of disturbance at home. But if it sends some one else by\r\nspring, I don’t care, provided that there be no extension of my term of\r\noffice. Those are my commissions, if you are in town. If you are out of\r\ntown, or even if you are not, the situation is this. I am in excellent\r\nspirits; and I hope, as my plans are well laid, that I am not too\r\nsanguine about my preparations. I have pitched camp in a safe spot, well\r\nsupplied on the score of corn, almost within sight of Cilicia,\r\nconvenient for change of quarters, with an army small but, I hope, very\r\nloyal to me, which will be doubled by the arrival of Deiotarus with all\r\nhis forces. I have found our allies far more loyal than any of my\r\npredecessors have found them. They cannot understand my mildness and\r\nself-abnegation.

I did the same at Colossae and\r\nduring a stay of five days at Apamea, three at Synnada, five at\r\nPhilomelus and ten at Iconium. Nothing could be more fair, lenient or\r\ndignified than my legal decisions. From there I came to camp on the 24th\r\nof August. On the 28th I reviewed the army at Iconium. On receipt of\r\ngrave news about the Parthians I left camp for Cilicia travelling\r\nthrough that part of Cappadocia which borders on Cilicia, intending that\r\nthe Armenian Artavasdes and the Parthians themselves should realize they\r\nwere cut off from entering Cappadocia. After camping five\r\n\r\nCappadocia se excludi putarent. Cum dies quinque ad Cybistra Cappadociae\r\ncastra habuissem, certior sum factus Parthos ab illo aditu Cappadociae\r\nlonge abesse, Ciliciae magis imminere. Itaque confestim iter in Ciliciam\r\nfeci per Tauri pylas. Tarsum veni a. d. III Nonas Octobres. Inde ad\r\nAmanum contendi, qui Syriam a Cilicia in aquarum divertio dividit; qui\r\nmons erat hostium plenus sempiternorum. Hic a. d. III Idus Octobr.\r\nmagnum numerum hostium occidimus. Castella munitissiina nocturno\r\nPomptini adventu, nostro matutino cepimus, incendimus. Imperatores\r\nappellati sumus. Castra paucos dies habuimus ea ipsa, quae contra Darium\r\nhabuerat apud Issum Alexander, imperator haud paulo melior quam aut tu\r\naut ego. Ibi dies quinque morati direpto et vastato Amano inde\r\ndiscessimus. Interim (scis enim dici quaedam πανικά, dici item τὰ κενὰ\r\nτοῦ πολέμου) rumore adventus nostri et Cassio, qui Antiochia tenebatur,\r\nanimus accessit, et Parthis timor iniectus est. Itaque eos cedentes ab\r\noppido Cassius insecutus rem bene gessit. Qua in fuga magna auctoritate\r\nOsaces dux Parthorum vulnus accepit eoque interiit paucis post diebus.\r\nErat in Syria nostrum nomen in gratia. Venit interim Bibulus; credo,\r\nvoluit appellatione hac inani nobis esse par. In eodem Amano coepit\r\nloreolam in mustaceo quaerere. At ille cohortem primam totam perdidit\r\ncenturionemque primi pili, nobilem sui generis, Asinium\r\n\r\ndays at Cybistra in Cappadocia, I got information that the Parthians\r\nwere far distant from that entrance into Cappadocia, and rather were\r\nthreatening Cilicia. So I made a forced march into Cilicia by the gates\r\nof Taurus. I reached Tarsus on the 5th of October. Thence I hurried to\r\nAmanus, which divides Syria from Cilicia by its watershed, a mountain\r\nthat has always been full of our enemies. Here on the 13th of October we\r\ncut up a large body of the enemy. I captured some strongly fortified\r\nposts by a night assault of Pomptinus and a day assault of my own: and\r\nwe burned them. I was hailed as “General.” For a few days I pitched camp\r\nat the very spot near Issus, where Alexander had camped against Darius.\r\nHe was rather a better general than you or I. We plundered and\r\ndevastated Amanus, and after a stay of five days took our departure.\r\nMeantime (for you know there are such words as “panic” and “the\r\nuncertainties of war”) report of my arrival gave heart to Cassius, who\r\nwas shut up in Antioch, and it inspired fear in the Parthians. So, as\r\nthe Parthians retreated from the town, Cassius pursued them and scored a\r\nsuccess. In their retreat one of their leaders, Osaces, a man of high\r\nrank, was wounded and died a few days afterwards. I was in high favour\r\nin Syria. Meantime Bibulus came. I fancy he wanted to be my peer in the\r\nmatter of that empty title. On this same mountain Amanus he begins his\r\ntask of looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.[188] But the whole of\r\nhis first squadron was lost as well as Asinius Dento, a centurion of the\r\nfirst line and of noble\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Lit. “a bay leaf in a wedding cake.” They were baked on bay leaves.\r\n\r\nDentonem, et reliquos cohortis eiusdem et Sex.

Gavius Caepio, who has wealth and\r\nposition. It was really a mortifying reverse and inopportune. I was at\r\nPindenissus, the most strongly fortified town in Eleutherocilicia and\r\nengaged in war so long as men can remember. The inhabitants were keen\r\nwarriors, thoroughly prepared to withstand a siege. We compassed it with\r\na stockade and ditch, with big entrenchments, penthouses, a tall tower,\r\na large supply of artillery and a number of archers. With much toil and\r\npreparation I settled the business without loss of life, though many\r\nwere wounded. I am keeping a festive holiday, as also are my soldiers,\r\nto whom I gave all the spoils except the horses. The captives were sold\r\non the third day of the festival of Saturn.[190] At the time of writing,\r\nthe sum realized at the auction has reached about £100,000.[191] I am\r\ngiving my army to my brother Quintus to take into winter quarters in the\r\nmore disturbed part of the province, while I am returning myself to\r\nLaodicea.\r\n\r\nSo much for that. To recur to old topics. As for the point of your\r\nexhortation, which is more important than anything else about which you\r\nare concerned—that I may satisfy even my carping Ligurian\r\ncritic[192]—may I die, if conduct could be more fastidious than mine. I\r\nam not going to talk of continence, a quality\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  Or “noble in his own class” (i.e. a good soldier), or “a noble of his\r\n  own kidney,” with a play on Asinius and _asinus_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  Dec. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  12,000,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  Probably P.

And it is not so much the enhancement\r\nof my reputation, though that is important, as the exercise of the\r\nvirtue that delights me. I can tell you my exile has been worth while,\r\nfor I did not understand myself nor realize of what I was capable in\r\nthis line. I may well be puffed up. It is splendid. Meantime I have made\r\na _coup_ in this: it is thanks to me that Ariobarzanes lives and reigns\r\na king. In my progress through the province I have saved a king and a\r\nkingdom by the weight of my advice and official position and by refusing\r\nto entertain even the visits much less the bribes of conspirators\r\nagainst him. Meantime from Cappadocia not the value of a hair. I stirred\r\nup Brutus out of his dejection as much as I could. I love him as well as\r\nyou do. I had almost said as well as I do you. And I hope that during\r\nthe whole of my year of office there will not be a penny’s expense in my\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThat is the whole story. I am now preparing to send an official despatch\r\nto Rome. It will be richer in detail than if I had sent it from Amanus.\r\nBut fancy your not being in town! Everything hangs on what happens on\r\nthe 1st of March, for I fear, when the question of the provinces is\r\nunder debate, that I may be kept here, if Caesar refuses to give up his\r\nprovince. Were you there to take part in the matter, I should have no\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nTo revert to city news, with which I was put in touch only on the 26th\r\nof December from your delightful letter. It was the letter which your\r\nfreedman Philogenes brought to me with scrupulous care after a long and\r\nrisky journey; for I have not received\r\n\r\nNam, quas Laeni pueris scribis datas, non acceperam.

It was\r\nglad tidings that you wrote me about Caesar and the decree of the House\r\nand your own hopes. If Caesar falls in with this, I shall be safe from\r\nany extension of office. I am not much concerned that Seius was singed\r\nin Plaetorius’ fire.[193] I want to know why Lucceius was so keen about\r\nQ. Cassias and what has happened.\r\n\r\nI am commissioned to celebrate the coming of age of Quintus, your\r\nsister’s son, on arrival at Laodicea. I shall keep a careful hold upon\r\nhim. Deiotarus, who has been of great help to me, has written that he\r\nwill come to me at Laodicea with the two boys. I am awaiting another\r\nletter from you from Epirus, that I may have an account not only of your\r\nwork-a-day life, but of your holiday life. Nicanor is doing his duty by\r\nme, and is being well treated. I think I shall send him to Rome with my\r\nofficial despatch, that it may be promptly delivered and at the same\r\ntime that he may bring me certain news about you and from you. I am\r\npleased that Alexis so often sends greetings to me; but why cannot he\r\nput them in a letter of his own, as Tiro, who is my Alexis, does for\r\nyou. I am searching for a horn for Phemius.[194] But enough now. Keep\r\nyour health and let me know when you intend to go to town.

But I am rather upset that you are absent from\r\nRome at a moment so critical for me. However I have one consolation: I\r\nhope you will have a pleasant winter where you are and a nice rest. You\r\nask me the purport of a letter that C. Cassius, the brother of Q.\r\nCassius, your friend, sent me. The letter he wrote is more modest than a\r\nsubsequent epistle in which he claimed to have ended the Parthian war.\r\nThe Parthians to be sure had retired from Antioch before the arrival of\r\nBibulus: but it was not thanks to any _coup de main_ of our troops.\r\nTo-day the enemy is wintering in Cyrrhestica and a serious war is\r\nimminent: for the son of Orodes the king of the Parthians is in a Roman\r\nprovince, and Deiotarus, to whose son the daughter of Artavasdes is\r\nbetrothed, a very competent authority, is positive that the king himself\r\nwill cross the Euphrates with all his forces in the early summer. On the\r\nvery day on which Cassius’ despatch, dated the 7th of October,\r\nannouncing victory was read in the Senate, came mine announcing trouble.\r\nMy friend Axius says that Cassius’ despatch gained no belief and mine\r\nwas considered worthy of attention. Bibulus’ despatch had not yet\r\narrived: but I know for a fact that it will express alarm.\r\n\r\nEx his rebus hoc vereor, ne, cum Pompeius propter metum rerum novarum\r\nnusquam dimittatur, Caesari nullus honos a senatu habeatur, dum hic\r\nnodus expediatur, non putet senatus nos, antequam successum sit,\r\noportere decedere nec in tanto motu rerum tantis provinciis singulos\r\nlegates praeesse. Hic, ne quid mihi prorogetur, quod ne intercessor\r\nquidem sustinere possit, horreo, atque eo magis, quod tu abes, qui\r\nconsilio, gratia, studio multis rebus occurreres. Sed dices me ipsum\r\nmihi sollicitudinem struere. Cogor, ut velim ita sit; sed omnia metuo.\r\nEtsi bellum ἀκροτελεύτιον habet illa tua epistula, quam dedisti nauseans\r\nButhroto: “Tibi, ut video et spero, nulla ad decedendum erit mora.”\r\nMallem “ut video,” nihil opus fuit “ut spero.” Acceperam autem satis\r\nceleriter Iconi per publicanorum tabellarios a Lentuli triumpho datas.\r\nIn his γλυκύπικρον illud confirmas, moram mihi nullam fore, deinde\r\naddis, si quid secus, te ad me esse venturum. Angunt me dubitationes\r\ntuae; simul et vides, quas acceperim litteras. Nam, quas Hermonis\r\ncenturionis caculae ipse scribis te dedisse, non accepi. Laeni pueris te\r\ndedisse saepe ad me scripseras. Eas Laodiceae denique, cum eo venissem,\r\nIII Idus Februar. Laenius mihi reddidit datas a. d. X Kal. Octobres.\r\nLaenio tuas commendationes et statim verbis et reliquo tempore re\r\nprobabo. Eae litterae cetera vetera habebant, unum\r\n\r\nThis makes me fear that the Senate may pay no respect to Caesar’s\r\ndemands, refusing to let Pompey quit Rome, when revolution is imminent.\r\nUntil this trouble is unravelled, it may decline to allow me to leave\r\nthe province before my successor comes, and not be willing to entrust\r\nsuch important provinces in troublous times to legates. So I shudder to\r\nthink that the term of my office may be extended without even any\r\ntribune being able to veto it; and the more so on account of your\r\nabsence, when you might interfere in many cases with your advice,\r\ninfluence and efforts. You will say I am raising imaginary alarms. I am\r\nforced to hope that my alarms may be idle, but everything frightens me.\r\nThough your letter written at Buthrotum in sickness had a charming\r\n_finale_. “As I see and hope, there will be nothing to hinder your\r\ndeparture,” still I should prefer the phrase “as I see” and there was no\r\nneed for the words “and hope.” I have received a letter dated just after\r\nthe triumph of Lentulus, which was brought post haste to Iconium by the\r\ntax-farmers’ messengers. In it you repeat that bitter-sweet saying, that\r\nthere will be no delay, with a postscript, that, if anything goes wrong,\r\nyou yourself will come to me. I am tortured by the doubts you express:\r\nand you may see which of your letters I have received, for I have not\r\ngot the letter which you say was handed to Hermo the centurion’s\r\norderly. You have repeatedly told me you entrusted a letter to the\r\nslaves of Laenius. That letter, which was dated the 21st of September,\r\nwas handed to me at last by Laenius on my arrival at Laodicea on the\r\n11th of February. I will show Laenius at once in word and in the future\r\nin deed that your recommendation carries weight. Besides old topics the\r\nletter had\r\n\r\nhoc novum de Cibyratis pantheris. Multum te amo, quod respondisti M.\r\nOctavio te non putare. Sed posthac omnia, quae recta non erunt, pro\r\ncerto negato. Nos enim et nostra sponte bene firmi et mehercule\r\nauctoritate tua inflammati vicimus omnes (hoc tu ita reperies) cum\r\nabstinentia tum iustitia, facilitate, clementia. Cave putes quicquam\r\nhomines magis umquam esse miratos quam nullum terruncium me obtinente\r\nprovinciam sumptus factum esse nec in rem publicam nec in quemquam\r\nmeorum praeterquam in L.

Is ceteroqui abstinens, sed\r\nIulia lege transitans,[195] semel tamen in diem, non, ut alii solebant,\r\nomnibus vicis (praeter eum semel nemo accepit) facit, ut mihi\r\nexcipiendus sit, cum terruncium nego sumptus factum.

Ipse in Asiam profectus sum Tarso Nonis Ianuariis,\r\nnon mehercule dici potest qua admiratione Ciliciae civitatum maximeque\r\nTarsensium. Postea vero quam Taurum transgressus sum, mirifica\r\nexspectatio Asiae nostrarum dioecesium, quae sex mensibus imperii mei\r\nnullas meas acceperat litteras, numquam hospitem\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  transitans _Manutius_: transitam _M_: pransitans _Peerlkamp_: in\r\n  transitu _Tyrrell_.\r\n\r\none fresh one, the panthers from Cibyra. I am indebted to you for\r\ntelling M. Octavius that you thought it would be impracticable. But in\r\nfuture give a direct “no” to any undesirable requests. Firm fixed in my\r\nown determination and fired by the weight of your opinion, I have\r\novercome everybody as you will find by my justice, self-abnegation and\r\neasy courtesy. People were never more astonished than to learn that not\r\na farthing has been spent during my tenure of office, either on public\r\nobjects or on any of my staff, except on my legate L. Tullius. He has\r\nbehaved well on the whole, but under the Julian law on one occasion _en\r\npassage_ and for the day’s needs, and not as others would at every\r\nhamlet, he did take something. He is the sole offender; and forces me to\r\nadd a rider to my remark that not a farthing has been spent upon us.\r\nBesides him no one has taken a penny. That blot I owe to my friend Q.\r\nTitinius.\r\n\r\nWhen the camp was struck at the end of the summer, I put my brother\r\nQuintus in charge of the winter camp and of Cilicia. Q. Volusius,\r\nson-in-law of your friend Tiberius, a safe man and wonderfully\r\nunselfish, I have sent to Cyprus, ordering him to stay a few days, that\r\nthe few Roman citizens in business there may not say they have no\r\nfacilities for legal process: the inhabitants cannot be summoned to a\r\ncourt outside the island. I myself set out for Asia from Tarsus on the\r\nfifth of January. I cannot describe how the cities in Cilicia and\r\nespecially the people of Tarsus looked up to me. After crossing the\r\nTaurus, I found Asia, that is so far as my district extends, very keen\r\nto welcome me. For during the six months of my administration, there had\r\nbeen no requisitions and\r\n\r\nviderat. Illud autem tempus quotannis ante me fuerat in hoc quaestu.\r\nCivitates locupletes, ne in hiberna milites reciperent, magnas pecunias\r\ndabant, Cyprii talenta Attica cc; qua ex insula (non ὑπερβολικῶς sed\r\nverissime loquor) nummus nullus me obtinente erogabitur. Ob haec\r\nbeneficia, quibus illi obstupescunt, nullos honores mihi nisi verborum\r\ndecerni sino, statuas, fana, τέθριππα prohibeo, nec sum in ulla re alia\r\nmolestus civitatibus—sed fortasse tibi, qui haec praedicem de me.\r\nPerfer, si me amas; tu enim me haec facere voluisti. Iter igitur ita per\r\nAsiam feci, ut etiam fames, qua nihil miserius est, quae tum erat in\r\nhaec mea Asia (messis enim nulla fuerat), mihi optanda fuerit. Quacumque\r\niter feci, nulla vi, nullo iudicio, nulla contumelia, auctoritate et\r\ncohortatione perfeci, ut et Graeci et cives Romani, qui frumentum\r\ncompresserant, magnum numerum populis pollicerentur. Idibus Februariis,\r\nquo die has litteras dedi, forum institueram agere Laodiceae Cibyraticum\r\net Apamense, ex Idibus Martiis ibidem Synnadense, Pamphylium (tum Phemio\r\ndispiciam κέρας), Lycaonium, Isauricum; ex Idibus Maiis in Ciliciam, ut\r\nibi Iunius consumatur, velim tranquille a Parthis. Quinctilis, si erit,\r\nut volumus, in itinere est per provinciam redeuntibus consumendus.\r\nVenimus enim in provinciam Laodiceam Sulpicio et Marcello consulibus\r\npridie Kalendas Sextiles.\r\n\r\nnot a single case of billeting. Before my time this season had been\r\ndevoted every year to the pursuit of gain. The richer states used to pay\r\nlarge sums to escape from having soldiers billeted on them for the\r\nwinter. The people of Cyprus used to pay nearly £50,000,[196] while\r\nunder my administration, in literal truth, not a penny will be demanded.\r\nI will take no honours except speechifying in return for these\r\nkindnesses which have so amazed people. I allow neither statues, nor\r\nshrines, nor sculptured chariots: and I don’t annoy the states in any\r\nother respects—but perhaps I may annoy you by my egotism. Bear with it\r\nfrom your regard for me. It was you who wished me to act as I have. My\r\ntour through Asia was such that even the crowning misery of famine,\r\nwhich existed in my province owing to the failure of the crops, gave me\r\na welcome opportunity. Wherever I went, without force, without legal\r\nprocess, without hard words, by my personal influence and exhortations,\r\nI induced Greeks and Roman citizens, who had stored corn, to promise a\r\nlarge quantity to the communities. On the 13th of February, the date on\r\nwhich I despatch this letter, I have arranged to try cases from Cibyra\r\nand Apamea at Laodicea; from the 15th of March, from Synnada, Pamphylia\r\n(when I will look out for a horn for Phemius), Lycaonia and Isaurum at\r\nthe same place. After the 15th of May, I set out to spend June in\r\nCilicia: I hope without being troubled by the Parthians. July, if things\r\nturn out as I hope, is to be spent on my journey back through the\r\nprovince. I entered the province at Laodicea during the consulship of\r\nSulpicius and Marcellus on the 31st of\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  200 Attic talents, which were of the value of £243 15s.\r\n\r\nInde nos oportet decedere a. d. III Kalendas Sextiles. Primum contendam\r\na Quinto fratre, ut se praefici patiatur, quod et illo et me invitissimo\r\nfiet. Sed aliter honeste fieri non potest, praesertim cum virum optimum,\r\nPomptinum, ne nunc quidem retinere possim. Rapit enim hominem Postumius\r\nRomam, fortasse etiam Postumia.\r\n\r\nHabes consilia nostra; nunc cognosce de Bruto. Familiares habet Brutus\r\ntuus quosdam creditores Salaminiorum ex Cypro, M. Scaptium et P.\r\nMatinium: quos mihi maiorem in modum commendavit. Matinium non novi.\r\nScaptius ad me in castra venit. Pollicitus sum curaturum me Bruti causa,\r\nut ei Salaminii pecuniam solverent. Egit gratias. Praefecturam petivit.\r\nNegavi me cuiquam negotianti dare (quod idem tibi ostenderam. Cn.\r\nPompeio petenti probaram institutum meum, quid dicam Torquato de M.\r\nLaenio tuo, multis aliis?); sin praefectus vellet esse syngraphae causa,\r\nme curaturum, ut exigeret. Gratias egit, discessit. Appius noster turmas\r\naliquot equitum dederat huic Scaptio, per quas Salaminios coerceret, et\r\neundem habuerat praefectum; vexabat Salaminios. Ego equites ex Cypro\r\ndecedere iussi. Moleste tulit Scaptius. Quid multa? ut ei fidem meam\r\npraestarem, cum ad me Salaminii Tarsum venissent et in iis Scaptius,\r\nimperavi, ut pecuniam solverent. Multa de syngrapha, de Scapti iniuriis.\r\nNegavi me audire; hortatus sum, petivi etiam pro\r\n\r\nJuly. I ought to quit it on the 30th of July. First, however, I must ask\r\nmy brother Quintus to be good enough to take charge, which will be\r\nagainst the grain with us both. But it will be the only fair course,\r\nespecially since even now I cannot keep that excellent fellow Pomptinus;\r\nfor Postumius is dragging him back to town, and perhaps Mrs Postumius\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThose are my plans. Now let me tell you about Brutus. Among his\r\nintimates your friend Brutus has some creditors of the people of Salamis\r\nin Cyprus, M. Scaptius and P. Matinius, whom he recommended to me\r\nwarmly. Matinius I have not met: Scaptius came to see me in camp. For\r\nthe sake of Brutus I promised that the people of Salamis should settle\r\ntheir debts to him. The fellow thanked me, and asked for the post of\r\nprefect. I informed him I always refused business men, as I have told\r\nyou. This rule Cn. Pompeius accepted when he made a similar request. So\r\ndid Torquatus, M. Laenius, and many others. However, I told Scaptius\r\nthat if he wanted the post on account of his bond, I would see that he\r\ngot paid. He thanked me and took his leave. Our friend Appius had given\r\nhim some squadrons to put pressure on the people of Salamis, and had\r\nalso given him the office of prefect. He was causing trouble to the\r\npeople of Salamis. I gave orders that his cavalry should leave the\r\nisland. That annoyed him. In short, to keep faith with him, I ordered\r\nthe people, when they came along with Scaptius to see me at Tarsus, to\r\npay the money. They had a good deal to say about the bond, and about the\r\nharm that Scaptius had done them. I refused to listen. I prayed and\r\nbesought them to\r\n\r\nmeis in civitatem beneficiis, ut negotium conficerent, denique dixi me\r\ncoacturum. Homines non modo non recusare, sed etiam hoc dicere, se a me\r\nsolvere. Quod enim praetori dare consuessent, quoniam ego non acceperam,\r\nse a me quodam modo dare, atque etiam minus esse aliquanto in Scapti\r\nnomine quam in vectigali praetorio. Collaudavi homines. “Recte,” inquit\r\nScaptius, “sed subducamus summam.” Interim, cum ego in edicto\r\ntranslaticio centesimas me observaturum haberem cum anatocismo\r\nanniversario ille ex syngrapha postulabat quaternas. “Quid ais?” inquam,\r\n“possumne contra meum edictum?” At ille profert senatus consultum\r\nLentulo Philippoque consulibus, VT, QVI CILICIAM OBTINERET, IVS EX ILLA\r\nSYNGRAPHA DICERET. Cohorrui primo; etenim erat interitus civitatis.\r\nReperio duo senatus consulta isdem consulibus de eadem syngrapha.\r\nSalaminii cum Romae versuram facere vellent, non poterant, quod lex\r\nGabinia vetabat. Tum iis Bruti familiares freti gratia Bruti dare\r\nvolebant quaternis, si sibi senatus consulto caveretur. Fit gratia Bruti\r\nsenatus consultum, VT NEVE SALAMINIIS, NEVE QVI EIS DEDISSET, FRAVDI\r\nESSET. Pecuniam numerarunt. At postea venit in mentem\r\n\r\nsettle the business in consideration of the good that I had done their\r\nstate. Finally, I threatened to compel them. So far from refusing to\r\nsettle, the people said that really they would be paying out of my\r\npocket, in the sense that I had refused to take the present usually\r\ngiven to the governor, which they admitted would be more than the amount\r\nthey owed to Scaptius. I praised their attitude. “Very well,” said\r\nScaptius; “but let us reckon up the total.” Now in my traditionary\r\nedict[197] I had fixed the rate of interest at 12 per cent compound\r\ninterest, reckoned by the year. But Scaptius demanded 48 per cent in\r\naccordance with the terms of the bond. I declared that I could not break\r\nthe rule laid down in my edict. But he produced a decree of the Senate,\r\nmade in the consulship of Lentulus and Philippus,[198] ordering that the\r\ngovernor of Cilicia should give judgement according to the bond. At\r\nfirst I was horror stricken, for it spelled ruin to the community. I\r\nfind there are two decrees of the Senate in the same year about this\r\nidentical bond. When the people of Salamis wanted to raise a loan in\r\ntown to pay off another, they were obstructed by a law of Gabinius which\r\nforbade lending to provincials. Then these intimates of Brutus,\r\ndepending on his support, professed willingness to lend at 48 per cent,\r\nif they were protected by a decree of the Senate. Brutus induced the\r\nSenate to make a decree that the transaction between the people of\r\nSalamis and the money-lenders should be exempted from the provisions of\r\nthe law. They paid down the money. Afterwards it came into the heads of\r\nthe\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  The edict is called _translaticium_, because it was handed down with\r\n  alterations from governor to governor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  B.C. 56.\r\n\r\nfaeneratoribus nihil se iuvare illud senatus consultum, quod ex\r\nsyngrapha ius dici lex Gabinia vetaret. Tum fit senatus consultum, VT EX\r\nEA SYNGRAPHA IVS DICERETVR, non ut alio iure ea syngrapha[199] esset\r\nquam ceterae, sed ut eodem. Cum haec disseruissem, seducit me Scaptius;\r\nait se nihil contra dicere, sed illos putare talenta cc se debere. Ea se\r\nvelle accipere. Debere autem illos paulo minus. Rogat, ut eos ad ducenta\r\nperducam. “Optime,” inquam. Voco illos ad me remoto Scaptio. “Quid? vos\r\nquantum,” inquam, “debetis?” Respondent CVI. Refero ad Scaptium. Homo\r\nclamare. “Quid? opus est,” inquam, “rationes conferatis?” Adsidunt,\r\nsubducunt; ad nummum convenit. Illi se numerare velle, urguere, ut\r\nacciperet. Scaptius me rursus seducit, rogat, ut rem sic relinquam. Dedi\r\nveniam homini impudenter petenti; Graccis querentibus, ut in fano\r\ndeponerent, postulantibus non concessi. Clamare omnes, qui aderant,\r\nnihil impudentius Scaptio, qui centesimis cum anatocismo contentus non\r\nesset; alii nihil stultius. Mihi autem impudens magis quam stultus\r\nvidebatur; nam aut bono nomine centesimis contentus non[200] erat aut\r\nnon bono quaternas centesimas sperabat.\r\n\r\nHabes meam causam. Quae si Bruto non probatur, nescio, cur illum amemus.\r\nSed avunculo eius certe probabitur, praesertim cum senatus consultum\r\nmodo factum sit, puto, postquam tu es profectus, in\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  IVS—syngrapha _is added by Boot_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  non _is added by Ernesti_.\r\n\r\nmoney-lenders that the decree would be futile, because Gabinius’ law\r\nforbade any legal process on the bond. Then the Senate passed a decree\r\nthat the bond should be good at law, giving this bond the same validity\r\nas other bonds and nothing more. When I pointed this out, Scaptius took\r\nme aside. He said that he had no objection to my ruling; but that the\r\npeople of Salamis imagined they owed him nearly £50,000. That he wanted\r\nto get that sum, but that they owed rather less. He begged me to induce\r\nthem to fix it at that amount. “Very well,” said I. I sent Scaptius\r\naway, and summoned the people and asked them the amount of the debt.\r\nThey replied something over £25,000. I consulted Scaptius again. He was\r\nloud in his protests. I said that the only plan was for them to check\r\ntheir accounts. They sat down and made out the account. It agreed to a\r\npenny with their statement. They wanted to pay, and begged him to\r\nreceive the money. Again Scaptius led me aside, and asked me to let the\r\nmatter stand over. The request was impertinent, but I consented. I would\r\nnot listen to the complaints of the Greeks and their demand to deposit\r\nthe sum in the temple treasury. The bystanders all declared that the\r\nconduct of Scaptius was outrageous in refusing 12 per cent with compound\r\ninterest. Others said he was a fool. He seemed to me to be more of a\r\nknave than a fool: for either he was not content with 12 per cent on\r\ngood security, or he hoped for 48 per cent on very doubtful security.\r\n\r\nThere is my case. If Brutus does not approve, there is no reason why I\r\nshould be friendly with him. Certainly his uncle will approve,\r\nespecially since a decree of the Senate has been passed (after you left\r\n\r\ncreditorum causa ut centesimae perpetuo faenore ducerentur. Hoc quid\r\nintersit, si tuos digitos novi, certe babes subductum. In quo quidem,\r\nὁδοῦ πάρεργον, L.

Iulius fecerit, cum dieculam\r\nduxerit: numquam rei publicae plus. Sed ad rem redeo. Meditare adversus\r\nBrutum causam meam, si haec causa est, contra quam nihil honeste dici\r\npotest, praesertim cum integram rem et causam reliquerim.\r\n\r\nReliqua sunt domestica.

Litteras tuas minus paulo exspecto, quam si\r\nRomae esses, sed tamen exspecto.\r\n\r\nRome, I think) in the matter of money-lenders, that 12 per cent simple\r\ninterest shall be the rate. The difference between the two totals you\r\nwill already have arrived at, if I do not belie your skill as a\r\nready-reckoner. _Apropos_ of this, by the way, L. Lucceius, son of\r\nMarcus, writes me a petulant letter that there is great danger of a\r\ngeneral repudiation of debts resulting from these decrees. He recalls\r\nthe harm that C. Julius did once when he allowed a little postponement\r\nof the day of payment: public credit never received a worse blow. But to\r\nreturn to my point. Think over my case against Brutus, if it is a case,\r\nwhen there are no fair arguments on the other side, especially as I have\r\nleft the matter as it stood.\r\n\r\nTo wind up with family matters. As to my _boudoir_ business, I agree\r\nwith you in preferring Postumia’s son,[201] since Pontidia is playing\r\nthe fool. But I wish you were there. You must expect no letters from\r\nQuintus at this season. The snows prevent passage of the Taurus until\r\nJune. I am supporting Thermus, as you request, by frequent letters. As\r\nfor P. Valerius, Deiotarus says that he has nothing and is his\r\npensioner. When you know whether there are to be additions to the\r\ncalendar at Rome or not, please write me positive news as to the date of\r\nthe Mysteries. I look forward to your letters rather less eagerly than\r\nif you were in town; still I do look forward to them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  Servius Sulpicius, as a husband for Tullia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           M.

I\r\nwill not pay “gold for brass” (for that is what you ask for), nor will I\r\nstart an arrangement of my own, but will keep to your order. You say\r\nthat the last letter you got from me was from Cybistra dated the 21st of\r\nSeptember, and you want to know which of yours I have received. Almost\r\nall you mention except those which you say were entrusted to Lentulus’\r\nservants at Equotuticus and Brundisium. So your energy is not a dead\r\nloss as you fear, but has been well spent, if you aimed at giving me\r\npleasure. For nothing has ever given me more pleasure.\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly glad that you approve of my reserve in the case of\r\nAppius and my generosity even in the matter of your friend Brutus. I had\r\nfeared you might not quite like it. For Appius on his journey sent me\r\ntwo or three letters showing pique, because I revoked some of his\r\nenactments. It is as if a doctor, when a patient has been placed under\r\nthe care of another, should be angry with his successor for changing his\r\nprescription. So Appius, having starved the province, let blood, and\r\ntried every lowering treatment, hands it to me drained of\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  i.e. the 19th of Feb., the Terminalia being on the 23rd.\r\n\r\nπροσανατρεφομένην eam a me non libenter videt, sed modo suscenset, modo\r\ngratias agit. Nihil enim a me fit cum ulla illius contumelia; tantum\r\nmodo dissimilitudo meae rationis offendit hominem. Quid enim potest esse\r\ntam dissimile quam illo imperante exhaustam esse sumptibus et iacturis\r\nprovinciam, nobis eam obtinentibus nummum nullum esse erogatum nec\r\nprivatim nec publice? Quid dicam de illius praefectis, comitibus,\r\nlegatis etiam? de rapinis, de libidinibus, de contumeliis? Nunc autem\r\ndomus mehercule nulla tanto consilio aut tanta disciplina gubernatur aut\r\ntam modesta est quam nostra tota provincia. Haec non nulli amici Appi\r\nridicule interpretantur, qui me idcirco putent bene audire velle, ut\r\nille male audiat, et recte facere non meae laudis, sed illius\r\ncontumeliae causa. Sin Appius, ut Bruti litterae, quas ad te misit,\r\nsignificabant, gratias nobis agit, non moleste fero, sed tamen eo ipso\r\ndie, quo haec ante lucem scribebam, cogitabam eius multa inique\r\nconstituta et acta tollere.\r\n\r\nNunc venio ad Brutum, quem ego omni studio te auctore sum complexus,\r\nquem etiam amare coeperam: sed ilico me revocavi, ne te offenderem. Noli\r\nenim putare me quicquam maluisse, quam ut mandatis satis facerem, nee\r\nulla de re plus laborasse. Mandatorum autem mihi libellum dedit,\r\nisdemque de rebus tu mecum egeras. Omnia sum diligentissime persecutus.\r\nPrimum ab Ariobarzane sic contendi, ut talenta, quae mihi pollicebatur,\r\nilli daret. Quoad mecum rex fuit, perbono loco res erat; post a Pompei\r\nprocuratoribus sescentis premi coeptus est.\r\n\r\nlife and cannot bear to see it being fed up by me. Sometimes he is\r\nangry, sometimes he thanks me; for no act of mine has reflected on his\r\npolicy. It is only the difference of my _regime_ that annoys him. There\r\nis a very wide difference between a province worn out by expense and\r\nlosses under his rule and not having to pay a penny out of private or\r\npublic purse under my administration. I need not mention his prefects,\r\nhis staff and his legates, the acts of robbery, of rape and insult. But\r\nnow, upon my word, no private house is managed with such judgement or\r\nsuch economy, or is so well ordered as my whole province. Some friends\r\nof Appius put an absurd construction on my policy and declare that I am\r\nseeking popularity to damage him, and am acting honourably, not for the\r\nsake of my own reputation, but to cause him shame. However, if Appius,\r\nas the letter from Brutus which you forward to me shows, expresses his\r\nthanks, I am content: but the very day on which I write this letter\r\nbefore dawn I am thinking of annulling many of his wrong enactments and\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nI come now to the matter of Brutus. On your advice I zealously\r\ncultivated his friendship, I had even begun to feel a real liking for\r\nhim: but there I pull myself up for fear I should vex you. For do not\r\nimagine that there is anything I should prefer better than to execute\r\nhis commission, or anything on which I have taken more pains. He gave me\r\na volume of commissions, and you spoke to me about his affairs. I have\r\ndone my best with all of them; first of all I induced Ariobarzanes to\r\npay him the money he promised me. So long as his highness was with me\r\nthe business was on a good footing: but later the king was dunned by\r\nscores of agents from\r\n\r\nPompeius autem cum ob ceteras causas plus potest unus quam ceteri omnes,\r\ntum quod putatur ad bellum Parthicum esse venturus. Ei tamen sic nunc\r\nsolvitur, tricensimo quoque die talenta Attica XXXIII et hoc ex\r\ntributis. Nec inde satis efficitur in usuram menstruam. Sed Gnaeus\r\nnoster clementer id fert; sorte caret, usura nec ea, solida contentus\r\nest. Alii neque solvit cuiquam nec potest solvere; nullum enim aerarimn,\r\nnullum vectigal habet. Appi instituto tributa imperat. Ea vix in faenus\r\nPompei quod satis sit efficiunt. Amici regis duo tresve perdivites sunt,\r\nsed ii suum tam diligenter tenent quam ego aut tu. Equidem non desino\r\ntamen per litteras rogare, suadere, accusare regem. Deiotarus etiam mihi\r\nnarravit se ad eum legatos misisse de re Bruti; eos sibi responsum\r\nrettulisse illum non habere. Et mehercule ego ita iudico. nihil illo\r\nregno spoliatius, nihil rege egentius. Itaque aut tutela cogito me\r\nabdicare aut ut pro Glabrione Scaevola faenus et impendium recusare. Ego\r\ntamen, quas per te Bruto promiseram praefecturas, M. Scaptio, L. Gavio,\r\nqui in regno rem Bruti procurabant, detuli; nec enim in provincia mea\r\nnegotiabantur. Tu autem meministi nos sic agere, ut, quot vellet\r\npraefecturas, sumeret, dum ne negotiatori. Itaque duas\r\n\r\nPompey. Pompey has more influence than anyone for many reasons and\r\nbecause it is rumoured that he will come to conduct the war against the\r\nParthians. Even to him however payment is made on the following terms.\r\nOn every thirtieth day some £8,000 is paid and that by tribute imposed\r\non the king’s subjects. Even such a sum will not cover the amount of\r\nmonthly interest. However our friend Gnaeus is an easy-going creditor.\r\nHe is willing to forgo his capital and is content with interest, and\r\nthat not in full. The king pays no one else and has no means to pay. He\r\nhas no treasury and no regular tribute: he levies taxes on the method of\r\nAppius. They are scarcely sufficient to pay the interest on Pompey’s\r\nmoney. His highness has two or three very wealthy friends, but they look\r\nafter their own pockets as well as you or I. Still I do not cease to\r\nwrite dunning, coaxing and scolding his highness. Deiotarus too has told\r\nme that he has sent messengers to him about his debt to Brutus: and they\r\ncame back with the reply that he has no assets. I can quite believe it,\r\nfor I have never seen a kingdom more plundered or a king more needy. So\r\nI am thinking of resigning my guardianship, or, as Scaevola did for\r\nGlabrio, of repudiating both capital and interest. However I have\r\nconferred the office of prefect, which I promised Brutus through you, on\r\nM. Scaptius and L. Gavius, who are his agents in the kingdom; for they\r\nwere not conducting their business in my province. You will remember\r\nthat my principle was that he might have as many offices of prefect at\r\nhis disposal as he liked, provided he did not give them to business men:\r\nso I offered him\r\n\r\nei praeterea dederam. Sed ii, quibus petierat, de provincia decesserant.\r\n\r\nNunc cognosce de Salaminiis, quod video tibi etiam novum accidisse\r\ntamquam mihi. Numquam enim ex illo audivi illam pecuniam esse suam; quin\r\netiam libellum ipsius habeo, in quo est: “Salaminii pecuniam debent M.\r\nScaptio et P. Matinio, familiaribus meis.” Eos mihi commendat; adscribit\r\netiam et quasi calcar admovet intercessisse se pro iis magnam pecuniam.\r\nConfeceram, ut solverent centesimis sexennii ductis cum renovatione\r\nsingulorum annorum. At Scaptius quaternas postulabat. Metui, si\r\nimpetrasset, ne tu ipse me amare desineres; nam ab edicto meo\r\nrecessissem et civitatem in Catonis et in ipsius Bruti fide locatam\r\nmeisque beneficiis ornatam funditus perdidissem. Atque hoc tempore ipso\r\nimpingit mihi epistulam Scaptius Bruti rem illam suo periculo esse, quod\r\nnec mihi umquam Brutus dixerat nec tibi, etiam ut praefecturam Scaptio\r\ndeferrem. Id vero per te exceperamus, ne negotiatori; quodsi cuiquam,\r\nhuic tamen non. Fuerat enim praefectus Appio et quidem habuerat turmas\r\nequitum, quibus inclusum in curia senatum Salamine obsederat, ut fame\r\nsenatores quinque morerentur. Itaque ego, quo die tetigi provinciam, cum\r\nmihi Cyprii legati Ephesum obviam venissent, litteras misi, ut equites\r\nex insula statim decederent. His de causis credo Scaptium iniquius de me\r\naliquid ad Brutum scripsisse. Sed tamen hoc sum animo.\r\n\r\ntwo others besides. But the gentlemen for whom he asked them had left my\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nNow to talk about the people of Salamis, a matter which I see came as a\r\nsurprise to you as it did to me. Brutus never told me that that money\r\nwas his. Indeed I have his own memorandum stating “The people of Salamis\r\nowe money to M. Scaptius and P. Matinius, my friends.” He recommends\r\nthese gentlemen to me, and to spur me adds a postscript that he has gone\r\nsecurity to them for a large sum. I had arranged that they should pay in\r\ncompound interest for six years at 12 percent. But Scaptius demanded 48\r\nper cent, I was afraid, if he got his request, that you too would cease\r\nto be my friend, for I should have departed from the terms of my own\r\nedict, and have ruined utterly a state enjoying the protection of Cato\r\nand Brutus himself and distinguished by my attentions. At this very\r\npoint Scaptius thrusts a letter of Brutus into my hand, stating what\r\nBrutus had never told me or you, that Brutus himself was the party\r\nconcerned, and asking me to give the office of prefect to his agent. But\r\nthat was the very proviso I had authorized you to make, that no office\r\ncould be given to a business man, above all to such a fellow as\r\nScaptius. For he had been a prefect of Appius, and indeed had had some\r\nsquadrons of cavalry, which he had used to beset the Senate at Salamis\r\nin their own chamber, so that five Members of the House died of\r\nstarvation. Accordingly on the day I reached the province, since an\r\nembassy from Cyprus had already met me at Ephesus, I sent orders that\r\nhis cavalry should leave the island at once. This, I fancy, had led\r\nScaptius to write somewhat bitterly about me to Brutus. However, my\r\nattitude\r\n\r\nSi Brutus putabit me quaternas centesimas oportuisse decernere, cum tota\r\nprovincia singulas observarem itaque edixissem, idque etiam acerbissimis\r\nfaeneratoribus probaretur, si praefecturam negotiatori denegatam\r\nqueretur, quod ego Torquato nostro in tuo Laenio, Pompeio ipsi in Sex.\r\nStatio negavi et iis probavi, si equites deductos moleste feret,\r\naccipiam equidem dolorem mihi illum irasci, sed multo maiorem non esse\r\neum talem, qualem putassem. Illud quidem fatebitur Scaptius, me ius\r\ndicente sibi omnem pecuniam ex edicto meo auferendi potestatem fuisse.\r\nAddo etiam illud, quod vereor tibi ipsi ut probem. Consistere usura\r\ndebuit, quae erat in edicto meo. Deponere volebant: impetravi a\r\nSalaminiis, ut silerent. Veniam illi quidem mihi dederunt, sed quid iis\r\nfiet, si huc Paulus venerit? Sed totum hoc Bruto dedi; qui de me ad te\r\nhumanissimas litteras scripsit, ad me autem, etiam cum rogat aliquid,\r\ncontumaciter, adroganter, ἀκοινονοήτως solet scribere. Tu autem velim ad\r\neum scribas de his rebus, ut sciam, quo modo haec accipiat; facies enim\r\nme certiorem.\r\n\r\nAtque haec superioribus litteris diligenter ad te perscripseram, sed\r\nplane te intellegere volui mihi non excidisse illud, quod tu ad me\r\nquibusdam litteris scripsisses, si nihil aliud de hac provincia nisi\r\nillius benevolentiam deportassem, mihi id satis esse. Sit sane, quondam\r\nita tu vis, sed tamen cum eo, credo, quod\r\n\r\nis this. If Brutus thinks that I ought to have allowed 48 per cent, when\r\nthroughout my province I have recognized only 12 per cent, and have\r\nfixed this rate in my edict, with the approval of the most grasping\r\nusurers; if he complains of my refusal to give office to a business man,\r\nwhich I made also to our friend Torquatus in the case of your\r\nacquaintance Laenius, and to Pompey himself in the case of Sex. Statius,\r\nwithout annoying either of them; if he is angry at the disbanding of his\r\ncavalry, well I shall be sorry that he is angry with me, but I shall be\r\nfar sorrier at discovering he is not the man I imagined he was. Scaptius\r\nwill admit that he had the opportunity of getting by my decision all the\r\nmoney allowed by my edict. I will add a point which I fear you may not\r\nlike, the interest allowed by my edict ought to have ceased to run.[203]\r\nThe people of Salamis wished to deposit the sum in a temple; but I\r\nbegged them not to raise the point. They gave way to me: but what will\r\nhappen to them if Brutus’ brother-in-law, Paulus, comes here? I allowed\r\nBrutus all this privilege: and he has written very kind letters about me\r\nto you; but to me, even when he asks a favour, he writes in an arrogant,\r\nbold tone and uncivilly. Please write to Brutus about the matter, that I\r\nmay know how he takes it. You can inform me.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, I had given you the full story in a former letter: but I\r\nwanted you to understand clearly that I had not forgotten a remark in\r\none of your letters, that if I took nothing else away from this province\r\nexcept Brutus’ good-will, that would be enough. Be it as you wish,\r\nprovided it can be so\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  If the money was deposited in a temple.\r\n\r\nsine peccato meo fiat. Igitur meo decreto soluta res Scaptio stat. Quam\r\nid rectum sit, tu iudicabis; ne ad Catonem quidem provocabo. Sed noli me\r\nputare ἐγκελεύσματα illa tua abiecisse, quae mihi in visceribus haerent.\r\nFlens mihi meam famam commendasti; quae epistula tua est, in qua non\r\neius mentionem facias? [Sidenote: Aristophanes, _Acharnians_, 659]\r\nItaque irascatur, qui volet; patiar. Τὸ γὰρ εὖ μετ’ ἐμοῦ, praesertim cum\r\nsex libris tamquam praedibus me ipse obstrinxerim, quos tibi tam valde\r\nprobari gaudeo. E quibus unum ἱστορικὸν requiris de Cn. Flavio, Anni\r\nfilio. Ille vero ante decemviros non fuit, quippe qui aedilis curulis\r\nfuerit, qui magistratus multis annis post decemviros institutus est.\r\nQuid ergo profecit, quod protulit fastos? Occultatam putant quodam\r\ntempore istam tabulam, ut dies agendi peterentur a paucis. Nec vero\r\npauci sunt auctores Cn. Flavium scribam fastos protulisse actionesque\r\ncomposuisse, ne me hoc vel potius Africanum (is enim loquitur) commentum\r\nputes. Οὐκ ἔλαθέ σε illud de gestu histrionis. Tu sceleste suspicaris,\r\nego ἀφελῶς scripsi. De me imperatore scribis te ex Philotimi litteris\r\ncognosse; sed credo te, iam in Epiro cum esses, binas meas de omnibus\r\nrebus accepisse, unas a Pindenisso capto, alteras Laodicea,\r\n\r\nwithout loss of honour to me. So I have given judgement that the payment\r\nof the people of Salamis to Scaptius is good at law. The equity of this\r\ncourse I will leave to your consideration. I will not even appeal to\r\nCato: but don’t think I have let slip your exhortations. They are fixed\r\nin my heart. With tears in your eyes, you told me to think of my\r\nreputation. Is there any letter of yours which does not touch on the\r\ntopic? So let who will be angry. I can put up with it. “The right is on\r\nmy side,” especially since I have bound myself to good conduct, with six\r\nvolumes[204] for bail. I am glad you like the books so much, though\r\nthere is one point of history which you question, that about Cn.\r\nFlavius, the son of Annius. He did not flourish before the days of the\r\ndecemviri, since he held a curule aedileship, which was instituted long\r\nafter their time. What good then did he do by publishing the official\r\ncalendar? It is thought that at one time the calendar was not exposed in\r\npublic, so that a privileged few might be the sole source of information\r\nas to days propitious for business. Moreover, several authorities\r\nmaintain that this Cn. Flavius was the first man to publish the calendar\r\nand to draw up a digest of the forms of legal procedure. So don’t think\r\nthat I, or rather my spokesman Africanus, invented a fiction. You took\r\nmy remark about the actor’s mannerism, and suspected a satirical\r\nmeaning:[205] but I wrote in all _naïveté_. You tell me that Philotimus\r\nwrote to you about my being hailed imperator; but I fancy that, now you\r\nare in Epirus, you have got my two letters about the business, one from\r\nPindenissus after its capture, another from Laodicea, both\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  The _De Republica_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  That it was a hit at Hortensius.\r\n\r\nutrasque tuis pueris datas. Quibus de rebus propter casum navigandi per\r\nbinos tabellarios misi Romam publice litteras.\r\n\r\nDe Tullia mea tibi adsentior scripsique ad eam et ad Terentiam mihi\r\nplacere. Tu enim ad me iam ante scripseras: “Ac vellem te in tuum\r\nveterem gregem rettulisses.” Correcta vero epistula Memmiana nihil\r\nnegotii fuit; multo enim malo hunc a Pontidia quam illum a Servilia.\r\nQuare adiunges Saufeium nostrum, hominem semper amantem mei, nunc,\r\ncredo, eo magis, quod debet etiam fratris Appi amorem erga me cum\r\nreliqua hereditate crevisse; qui declaravit, quanti me faceret, cum\r\nsaepe tum in Bursa. Ne tu me sollicitudine magna liberaris.\r\n\r\nFurni exceptio mihi non placet; nee enim ego ullum aliud tempus timeo,\r\nnisi quod ille solum excipit. Sed scriberem ad te de hoc plura, si Romae\r\nesses. In Pompeio te spem omnem otii ponere non miror. Ita res est,\r\nremovendumque censeo illud “dissimulantem.” Sed enim οἰκονομία si\r\nperturbatior est, tibi assignato. Te enim sequor σχεδιάζοντα.\r\n\r\nCicerones pueri amant inter se, discunt, exercentur, sed alter, uti\r\ndixit Isocrates in Ephoro et Theopompo, frenis eget, alter calcaribus.\r\nQuinto togam puram\r\n\r\ndelivered to your slaves. For fear of accidents at sea, I sent the\r\npublic despatch on my campaign to Rome in duplicate by different\r\ncarriers.\r\n\r\nAs to my daughter Tullia I agree with you, and I have written to her and\r\nher mother giving my consent. For a former letter of yours to me said “I\r\ncould wish you had returned to your old associates.” There was no\r\noccasion to alter the letter that came from Memmius: for I much prefer\r\nto accept this candidate from Pontidia than the other from Servilia. So\r\nget our friend Saufeius to help you in this business. He always liked\r\nme, and now I trust he will like me all the more, since he is bound to\r\nhave inherited his brother Appius’ liking for me along with the rest of\r\nhis inheritance, and Appius often expressed great affection for me,\r\nespecially in the trial of Bursa. Indeed you will relieve me of a source\r\nof great anxiety.\r\n\r\nI do not like Furnius’ proviso; there is nothing else I fear, except the\r\npoint which he makes his sole proviso.[206] I would write to you more\r\nfully on the point, if you were in Rome. I am not surprised that you\r\ndepend entirely on Pompey for keeping the peace. That is quite right,\r\nand I think you must delete your phrase “insincere.” If the order of my\r\nparagraphs is muddled, you have yourself to blame, as I am following\r\nyour own harum-scarum way.\r\n\r\nMy son and nephew are fond of one another, learn their lessons and take\r\ntheir exercise together: but to quote Isocrates’ remark about Ephorus\r\nand Theopompus, one wants the rein and the other the spur.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  Apparently a proposal by a tribune that the governors of Syria and\r\n  Cilicia could quit their provinces at the end of the year, provided\r\n  the Parthians were not aggressive.\r\n\r\nLiberalibus cogitabam dare; mandavit enim pater.

Dionysius is\r\nin my good graces: but the boys say he is liable to mad fits of temper.\r\nHowever one could not get a master of more learning and better character\r\nand more liking for you and me. The praise you hear of Thermus and\r\nSilius is deserved: they conduct themselves in very honourable fashion.\r\nYou may praise M. Nonius, Bibulus, and myself too, if you like. I only\r\nwish Scrofa had scope for his tact. He is a fine fellow. The rest do\r\nlittle credit to Cato’s caucus. I am much obliged to you for\r\nrecommending my case to Hortensius. As to Amianus Dionysius says there\r\nis no help. I have met with no trace of Terentius. Moeragenes has\r\ncertainly been killed. I made a tour through his district and found not\r\na living thing. I did not know this, when I spoke to your agent\r\nDemocritus. I have ordered the Rhosian ware for you. But what the deuce\r\nwill you serve up in porcelain, when you are accustomed to give us\r\nvegetarian fare on fern-pattern plates and in magnificent baskets? I\r\nhave ordered a horn for Phemius, and one will be got. I only hope that\r\nhis tune will be worthy of the instrument.\r\n\r\nA war with the Parthians is imminent. Cassius’ despatch was futile,\r\nBibulus’ has not yet come. I think the reading of it will stir the House\r\nto action at last. I am very anxious myself.

Quid quaeris? aliquantum est negotii.\r\n\r\nDe Bibuli edicto nihil novi praeter illam exceptionem, de qua tu ad me\r\nscripseras, “nimis gravi praeiudicio in ordinem nostrum.” Ego tamen\r\nhabeo ἰσοδυναμοῦσαν, sed tectiorem, ex Q. Muci P. f. edicto Asiatico,\r\nEXTRA QVAM SI ITA NEGOTIVM GESTVM EST, VT EO STARI NON OPORTEAT EX FIDE\r\nBONA, multaque sum secutus Scaevolae, in iis illud, in quo sibi\r\nlibertatem censent Graeci datam, ut Graeci inter se disceptent suis\r\nlegibus. Breve autem edictum est propter hanc meam διαίρεσιν, quod\r\nduobus generibus edicendum putavi. Quorum unum est provinciale, in quo\r\nest de rationibus civitatum, de aere alieno, de usura, de syngraphis; in\r\neodem omnia de publicanis, alterum, quod sine edicto satis commode\r\ntransigi non potest, de\r\n\r\nto fear. Very good. Bibulus can check them for two months, but what will\r\nhappen to the man whom I leave behind, especially if he be my brother?\r\nOr what will be my own fate, if I do not depart so speedily? It is a\r\ngreat bother. However Deiotarus has decided to join my camp in full\r\nforce. He has thirty squadrons of four hundred men each armed in our\r\nfashion, and two thousand cavalry. He can hold out till Pompey comes. A\r\nletter he writes to me presumes that he will conduct the campaign. The\r\nParthians spend the winter in a Roman province. Orodes is expected in\r\nperson. You may take my word it is a big business.\r\n\r\nAs to Bibulus’ edict there is no new feature, except that proviso of\r\nwhich you wrote “it is a very grave reflection on our order.”[209]\r\nHowever I have a similar proviso, in more circumspect language, borrowed\r\nfrom the Asiatic edict of Q. Mucius, son of Publius, “Provided that the\r\nagreement is not such as contravenes equity.” I have followed Scaevola\r\nin many details, among them in the stipulation which the Greeks hold as\r\nthe salvation of their freedom, that Greek cases are to be settled\r\naccording to Greek law. The edict is short on account of the division I\r\nhave made, as I considered it fell better under two heads. The one\r\nconcerns provincial matters and deals with town accounts, debt, the rate\r\nof interest, contracts, and includes all matters referring to the\r\ntax-collectors. The second head, embracing matters which cannot properly\r\nbe settled without an\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Bibulus had excepted from debts recoverable in his court cases in\r\n  which _vis_ or _dolus malus_ had been used. The clause was directed\r\n  against _publicani_ and _negotiatores_ who belonged to the _equites_.\r\n\r\nhereditatum possessionibus, de bonis possidendis, vendendis, magistris\r\nfaciendis, quae ex edicto et postulari et fieri solent.

Vestri enim, credo, graves habent Turpionem sutorium et Vettium\r\nmancipem.\r\n\r\nDe publicanis quid agam, videris quaerere. Habeo in deliciis, obsequor,\r\nverbis laudo, orno; efficio, ne cui molesti sint. Τὸ παραδοξότατον,\r\nusuras eorum, quas pactionibus adscripserant, servavit etiam Servilius.\r\nEgo sic. Diem statuo satis laxam, quam ante si solverint, dico me\r\ncentesimas ducturum; si non solverint, ex pactione. Itaque et Graeci\r\nsolvunt tolerabili faenore, et publicanis res est gratissima, si illa\r\niam habent pleno modio, verborum honorem, invitationem crebram. Quid\r\nplura? sunt omnes ita mihi familiares, ut se quisque maxime putet. Sed\r\ntamen μηδὲν αὐτοῖς—scis reliqua.\r\n\r\nDe statua Africani (ὢ πραγμάτων ἀσυγκλώστων sed me id ipsum delectavit\r\nin tuis litteris) ain tu? Scipio hic Metellus proavum suum nescit\r\ncensorem non\r\n\r\nedict, deals with inheritance, ownership and sale, the appointment of\r\nofficial receivers, matters where suits are wont to be brought and\r\nsettled in accordance with the terms of an edict. A third head dealing\r\nwith the rest of judicial procedure I left unwritten. I stated that in\r\nsuch matters my decrees would be based on those of Rome. I observe this\r\nrule, and so far satisfy everybody. The Greeks are jubilant at having\r\nforeign jurors. You may say that the jurors are wasters: however the\r\nGreeks flatter themselves that they have got home rule, and your own\r\njurors are men of the lofty standing of Turpio the shoe maker and\r\nVettius the broker.\r\n\r\nYou ask how I am dealing with the tax-gatherers. I pet them, indulge\r\nthem, praise and honour them: and take care they trouble no one. It is\r\nvery odd that the rates of interest specified in their bonds were upheld\r\neven by Servilius. My procedure is this. I name a day fairly remote,\r\nbefore which, if the debtors pay up, I lay down that I shall allow only\r\n12 per cent. But, if they have not paid, judgement will be according to\r\nthe bond. Accordingly the Greeks pay their debts at a fair rate of\r\ninterest, and the farmers are gratified, provided they get their fill of\r\ncompliments and invitations. In short, they are all so intimate with me\r\nthat each man thinks himself my special favourite. But still you know\r\nthe old saw.[210]\r\n\r\nAs to the statue of Africanus (what a medley of topics! but that was the\r\ndelightful feature of your letter, to my mind), do you really mean that\r\nMetellus Scipio does not know his great-grandfather\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  The quotation is incomplete, and the ending of it unknown. Probably it\r\n  contained advice either against trusting or humouring people too much.\r\n\r\nfuisse? Atqui nihil habuit aliud inscriptum nisi cos. ea statua, quae ad\r\nOpis nuper[211] posita in excelso est. In illa autem, quae est ad\r\nΠολυκλέους Herculem, inscriptum est CENS;[212] quam esse eiusdem status,\r\namictus, anulus, imago ipsa declarat. At mehercule ego, cum in turma\r\ninauratarum equestrium, quas hic Metellus in Capitolio posuit,\r\nanimadvertissem in Serapionis subscriptione Africani imaginem, erratum\r\nfabrile putavi, nunc video Metelli. O ἀνιστορησίαν turpem! Nam illud de\r\nFlavio et fastis, si secus est, commune erratum est, et tu belle\r\nἠπόρησας, et nos publicam prope opinionem secuti sumus, ut multa apud\r\nGraecos. Quis enim non dixit Εὔπολιν, τὸν τῆς ἀρχαίας, ab Alcibiade\r\nnavigante in Siciliam deiectum esse in mare? Redarguit Eratosthenes;\r\nadfert enim, quas ille post id tempus fabulas docuerit. Num idcirco\r\nDuris Samius, homo in historia diligens, quod cum multis erravit,\r\ninridetur? Quis Zaleucum leges Locris scripsisse non dixit? Num igitur\r\niacet Theophrastus. si id a Timaeo, tuo familiari, reprensum est? Sed\r\nnescire proavum suum censorem non fuisse turpe est, praesertim cum post\r\neum consulem nemo Cornelius illo vivo censor fuerit.\r\n\r\nQuod de Philotimo et de solutione HS |¯XXDC¯| scribis, Philotimum\r\ncirciter Kal. Ianuarias in Chersonesum audio venisse. At mi ab eo nihil\r\nadhuc. Reliqua mea Camillus scribit se accepisse. Ea quae\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  nuper _Boot_; per te _MSS._\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  _I have adopted Tyrrell’s transposition of_ COS. (= CONSUL) _and_\r\n  CENS. (= CENSOR) _though with doubts of its correctness_.\r\n\r\nwas never censor? Certainly the statue which has lately been placed on\r\nhigh near the temple of Ops has only the inscription COS. But the statue\r\nnear the Hercules of Polycles bears the inscription CENS.: and the pose,\r\nthe dress, the ring and the likeness prove that it is a statue of the\r\nsame person. As a matter of fact, when among the crowd of gilded knights\r\nplaced by Metellus on the Capitol, I noticed a likeness of Africanus\r\nwith the name Serapio on the pedestal, I thought it was a workman’s\r\nerror, but now I see it is Metellus’ mistake. What gross ignorance of\r\nhistory! For that misconception about Flavius and the calendar, if it is\r\nsuch, is widely held: and you were quite right in having doubts about\r\nit. I have followed the view which is almost universal, as Greek authors\r\noften do. Every one says that Eupolis, the poet of the old Comedy, was\r\nthrown into the sea by Alcibiades on his voyage to Sicily. Eratosthenes\r\nconfutes this, producing plays exhibited by him after that date. But\r\nthat is no reason for laughing at Duris of Samos, who is an accurate\r\nhistorian, because he follows a vulgar error. All historians agree that\r\nZaleucus drew up laws for the Locrians. It is not therefore fatal to\r\nTheophrastus, if he is called to account for that by your friend\r\nTimaeus. But not to know that one’s great-grandfather was not censor is\r\nshocking, especially as after his consulship no Cornelius was censor\r\nduring his lifetime.\r\n\r\nAs for your remarks about Philotimus and the payment of £182,000,[213] I\r\nhear that Philotimus came to the Chersonese about the beginning of\r\nJanuary, but so far I have heard nothing from him. Camillus writes that\r\nhe has received my balance. I don’t know how\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  20,600,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nsint, nescio et aveo scire.

Filiola tua gratum mihi fecit, quod tibi\r\ndiligenter mandavit, ut mihi salutem adscriberes, gratum etiam Pilia,\r\nsed illa officiosius, quod mihi, quem iam pridem numquam vidit. Igitur\r\ntu quoque salutem\r\n\r\nmuch it is, and I should like to know. However, we can discuss this\r\nlater and more conveniently when we meet.\r\n\r\nThat remark at the end of your letter, my dear Atticus, upset me. You\r\nused the phrase, “What more is there to say,” and follow it by a most\r\naffectionate warning not to forget to be on the watch and to keep an eye\r\non events. Have you heard anything about any of my staff? I am sure\r\nthere has been no wrong-doing, _pas du tout_. It could not have escaped\r\nmy notice, and it will not. But your earnest entreaty seemed to hint\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nAs for M. Octavius, I repeat that your reply was excellent. I could wish\r\nit had been in more positive terms. For Caelius has sent me a freedman\r\nof his and a carefully worded letter about panthers and an offer from\r\nthe townships to furnish contributions. I replied that the second item\r\nis annoying, if my conduct is still a secret and the news has not\r\nreached town that in my province no money is exacted except in\r\nsatisfaction of debts: and I have told him that it would be improper for\r\nme to allow payment and for him to take it. I have a sincere regard for\r\nhim and have warned him that after his prosecution of other people he\r\nshould conduct himself on more careful lines. As to the second point I\r\nhave told him it would be a blot on my escutcheon that the people of\r\nCibyra should have a public hunt during my governorship.\r\n\r\nLepta leaps with joy over your letter: for it was nicely written and\r\nputs me in his good graces. Your tiny daughter has done me a favour in\r\nordering you earnestly to send me her greetings. It was kind of Pilia\r\nand very dutiful of your daughter to send greetings to one whom as yet\r\nshe has never met. So please\r\n\r\nutrique adscribito. Litterarum datarum dies pr. Kal.

Putat enim suos nummos vos\r\n\r\ngive my greetings to both of them in return. The date of your letter,\r\nthe last day of December, reminded me pleasantly of the famous and\r\nunforgotten oath I took.[214] I was a Pompey in state robes that day.\r\nThere you have my answer to all your points: not as you asked “gold for\r\ncopper,” but like for like.\r\n\r\nThere was another short letter which I will not leave unanswered.\r\nLucceius to be sure was able to do something for the villa at Tusculum,\r\nunless perhaps there was the old obstacle of the flute player[215]; and\r\nI should like to know its condition. Our friend Lentulus I hear has\r\nadvertised all his property except that at Tusculum. I should like to\r\nsee these gentlemen free from debt as well as Sestius and you may add\r\nCaelius too. To all of them one may apply the quotation, “ashamed to\r\nrefuse, but yet afraid to take.” I suppose you have heard of Curio’s\r\nidea to recall Memmius. As for the debt due from Egnatius of Sidicinum,\r\nI have some hope, but not much. Deiotarus is taking very great care of\r\nPinarius, whom you recommended to me, in a serious illness. So there is\r\nmy answer to your little letter.\r\n\r\nWhile I am at Laodicea, which will be up to the 15th of May, please\r\ncorrespond with me as often as possible, and on your arrival at Athens\r\nat any rate send me letter carriers, since by that time we shall know\r\nwhat has been done in town and about the provinces, of which the affairs\r\nare settled in March. By the bye have you yet got Herodes to wring from\r\nCaesar that £12,000? I hear you have excited the animosity of Pompey in\r\nthe matter. He thinks that\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n   Cicero refers to the day on which he laid down the consulship.

Vedius, a shady character, but an\r\nintimate of Pompey. The fellow met me on the road with two chariots, a\r\ncarriage and horses and a litter and a large following. If Curio carries\r\nhis law,[216] he will have to pay £l apiece. Besides other things, there\r\nwas a dog-faced baboon in a chariot, and some wild asses. I never met\r\nsuch a rascal. But listen to the end of the story, At Laodicea Vedius\r\nput up with Pompeius Vindullus, and left his belongings with him, while\r\nhe came to meet me. Meantime Vindullus died, and his property is\r\nsupposed to go to Pompeius Magnus. C. Vennonius went to the house and,\r\nwhile sealing all the goods, found Vedius’ baggage. Among this baggage\r\nthere were five little busts of Roman married ladies, among them one of\r\nthe sister of your friend Brutus—a brute indeed to be acquainted with\r\nthe fellow—and one of the wife of Lepidus, whose easy conduct agrees\r\nwith the meaning of his name. I wanted to tell you this little tale _en\r\npassant_, for we are both nice gossips.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I wish you to consider. I hear that Appius is putting\r\nup a porch at Eleusis. Shall I look a fool, if I do so in the Academy? I\r\ndare say you may think so: say so plainly, if you do. I am very fond of\r\nthe city of Athens. I should like it to have some memorial of myself. I\r\ndislike lying titles on the statues of other folk. But as you think\r\nbest.

Mai. a. 704_]\r\n\r\nCum Philogenes, libertus tuus, Laodiceam ad me salutandi causa venisset\r\net se statim ad te navigaturum esse diceret, has ei litteras dedi,\r\nquibus ad eas rescripsi, quas acceperam a Bruti tabellario. Et\r\nrespondebo primum postremae tuae paginae, quae mihi magnae molestiae\r\nfuit, quod ad te scriptum est a Cincio de Stati sermone; in quo hoc\r\nmolestissimum est, Statium dicere a me quoque id consilium probari.\r\nProbari autem? De isto hactenus dixerim, me vel plurima vincla tecum\r\nsummae coniunctionis optare, etsi sunt amoris artissima; tantum abest,\r\nut ego ex eo, quo astricti sumus, laxari aliquid velim. Illum autem\r\nmulta de istis rebus asperius solere loqui saepe arbitror. In hac autem\r\nperegrinatione militiave nostra saepe incensum ira vidi, saepe placatum.\r\nQuid ad Statium scripserit, nescio. Quicquid acturus de tali re fuit,\r\nscribendum tamen ad libertum non fuit. Mihi autem erit maxumae curae, ne\r\nquid fiat secus, quam re se quemque praestare, ac maxumae partes istius\r\n\r\nmysteries at Rome, and how you are passing the winter. Keep well. I\r\nwrite this on the seven hundred and sixty-fifth day after the battle of\r\nLeuctra.[217]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Laodicea, May_, B.C. _50_]\r\n\r\nYour freedman Philogenes has come to visit me at Laodicea and tells me\r\nthat he is on the point of sailing to join you: so I give him this\r\nletter in reply to your letter which I got from Brutus’ letter-carrier.\r\nFirst I will answer your last page which caused me much concern:—that is\r\nabout Cincius’ communication on the talk he had with Statius. I was\r\nparticularly concerned at Statius’ remark that the plan had my approval.\r\nApproval indeed! I need only say thus much. I wish the ties of\r\nfriendship to be as many and close as possible between us, though none\r\ncan be so close as those of our common liking. I am far from wanting the\r\ntie between us to be relaxed. Quintus however to my knowledge will often\r\nuse bitter language on his private affairs, and often I have pacified\r\nhis anger, as I think you know. On my late tour or military campaign I\r\nhave seen him often fly in a temper and often calm again. I don’t know\r\nwhat he wrote to Statius; whatever he meant to do, he ought not to have\r\ninformed a freedman. However I will do my best to prevent any course\r\ncontrary to our wishes and to propriety. In a case like this it is not\r\nenough for a man to make himself responsible for his own conduct only:\r\nand\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Cicero refers thus to the killing of Clodius on Jan. 18, 52 B.C.,\r\n  comparing it with the defeat of the Spartans by Epaminondas at Leuctra\r\n  in 371 B.C.\r\n\r\nofficii sunt pueri Ciceronis sive iam adulescentis; quod quidem illum\r\nsoleo hortari. Ac mihi videtur matrem valde, ut debet, amare teque\r\nmirifice. Sed est magnum illud quidem, verum tamen multiplex pueri\r\ningenium; in quo ego regendo habeo negotii satis.\r\n\r\nQuoniam respondi postremae tuae paginae prima mea, nunc ad primam\r\nrevertar tuam. Peloponnesias civitates omnes maritimas esse hominis non\r\nnequam, sed etiam tuo iudicio probati, Dicaearchi, tabulis credidi. Is\r\nmultis nominibus in Trophoniana Chaeronis narratione Graecos in eo\r\nreprendit, quod mare tantum secuti sint, nec ullum in Peloponneso locum\r\nexcipit. Cum mihi auctor placeret (etenim erat ἱστορικώτατος et vixerat\r\nin Peloponneso), admirabar tamen et vix adcredens communicavi cum\r\nDionysio. Atque is primo est commotus, deinde, quod de isto Dicaearcho\r\nnon minus bene existumabat quam tu de C. Vestorio, ego de M. Cluvio, non\r\ndubitabat, quin ei crederemus. Arcadiae censebat esse Lepreon quoddam\r\nmaritumum; Tenea autem et Aliphera ct Tritia νεόκτιστα ei videbantur,\r\nidque τῷ τῶν νεῶν καταλόγῳ confirmabat, ubi mentio non fit istorum.\r\nItaque istum ego locum totidem verbis a Dicaearcho transtuli.\r\n“Phliasios” autem dici sciebam, et ita fac ut habeas; nos quidem sic\r\nhabemus. Sed primo me ἀναλογία deceperat, Φλιοῦς, Ὀποῦς, Σιποῦς, quod\r\nὈπούντιοι, Σιπούντιοι. Sed hoc continuo correximus.\r\n\r\nLaetari te nostra moderatione et continentia video.\r\n\r\nindeed the principal share of responsibility attaches to the boy, or\r\nyoung man as he is now, Quintus. This I am always telling him. To me he\r\nseems to love his mother greatly, as he should, and to be extremely fond\r\nof you. He is a lad of high but complex character, and I have enough to\r\ndo to guide his conduct.\r\n\r\nHaving devoted my first page to answering your last, I will now return\r\nto your first. I relied on the maps of Dicaearchus, a writer of no mean\r\nstanding and an authority you accept, for the information that all the\r\nstates of the Peloponnese bordered on the sea. In the account of the\r\ncave of Trophonius, which he puts into the mouth of Chaeron, he blames\r\nthe Greeks on many scores for sticking to the sea coast; and he does not\r\nexcept a single district in the Peloponnese. He was a very accurate\r\nhistorian and lived in the Peloponnese, so that his evidence seemed\r\ntrustworthy. Still I was surprised and communicated my doubts to\r\nDionysius. Dionysius was startled at first, but finally accepted his\r\nauthority, since he had as good an opinion of Dicaearchus as you have of\r\nC. Vestorius or I of M. Cluvius. Arcadia he agreed had a seaport\r\nLepreon: but Tenea, Aliphera and Tritia were, he considered, more\r\nmodern, a view he supported by the omission of these places from Homer’s\r\ncatalogue of the ships. Accordingly I borrowed the passage from\r\nDicaearchus in so many words. I know that Phliasii is the proper form.\r\nPlease make it so in your copy. I read it in mine. But first of all\r\nthinking of Phlious I was misled by a vicious analogy of Opuntii from\r\nOpous and Sipuntii from Sipous. But I altered it at once.\r\n\r\nI see that you are pleased at my unselfish moderation.\r\n\r\nTum id magis faceres, si adesses. Atque hoc foro, quod egi ex Idibus\r\nFebruariis Laodiceae ad Kal. Maias omnium dioecensium praeter Ciliciae,\r\nmirabilia quaedam effecimus. Ita multae civitates omni aere alieno\r\nliberatae, multae valde levatae sunt, omnes suis legibus et iudiciis\r\nusae αὐτονομίαν adeptae revixerunt. His ego duobus generibus facultatem\r\nad se aere alieno liberandas aut levandas dedi, uno, quod omnino nullus\r\nin imperio meo sumptus factus est (nullum cum dico, non loquor\r\nὑπερβολικῶς), nullus, inquam, ne terruncius quidem. Hac autem re\r\nincredibile est quantum civitates emerserint. Accessit altera. Mira\r\nerant in civitatibus ipsorum furta Graecorum, quae magistratus sui\r\nfecerant. Quaesivi ipse de iis, qui annis decem proximis magistratum\r\ngesserant. Aperte fatebantur. Itaque sine ulla ignominia suis umeris\r\npecunias populis rettulerunt. Populi autem nullo gemitu publicanis,\r\nquibus hoc ipso lustro nihil solverant, etiam superioris lustri\r\nreddiderunt. Itaque publicanis in oculis sumus. “Gratis,” inquis,\r\n“viris.” Sensimus. Iam cetera iuris dictio nec imperita et clemens cum\r\nadmirabili facilitate; aditus autem ad me minime provinciales; nihil per\r\ncubicularium; ante lucem inambulabam domi ut olim candidatus. Grata haec\r\net magna mihique nondum laboriosa ex illa vetere militia. Nonis Maiis in\r\nCiliciam cogitabam. Ibi cum Iunium\r\n\r\nYou would be more pleased, if you were here. In this very assize which I\r\nhave been holding at Laodicea from the 13th of February to the 1st of\r\nMay for all the districts except Cilicia, I have done wonders. See how\r\nmany states have been freed from debt and how many have had their burden\r\nlightened. All have revived on acquiring home rule, and using their own\r\nenactments in law. I have given them in two ways the chance of freeing\r\nthemselves or relieving themselves from debt. First by causing them no\r\nexpense during my administration (and in saying no expense I mean\r\nliterally not one farthing), which has helped them astonishingly out of\r\ntheir trouble. Secondly the states had suffered from surprising\r\ncorruption in their own countrymen, that is to say their magistrates. I\r\nquestioned the men who had held the office of magistrate during the last\r\nten years. They concealed nothing. So without exposure they took on\r\ntheir own backs the repayment of the money: and the communities which\r\nhad paid the tax-farmers nothing for the present five years have now\r\nwithout any complaints paid up arrears for the last five years too. So I\r\nam the apple of their eye to the tax-farmers. “Grateful fellows,” you\r\nexclaim. Yes I have experienced their gratitude. The rest of my judicial\r\nconduct has been enlightened, but mild and marvellously courteous. There\r\nhas been none of the difficulty of access so characteristic of\r\nprovincial governors; and no backstairs jobbery. Before daybreak I walk\r\nup and down in my house, as I did of yore when a candidate for office.\r\nThis is popular and a great boon, and I have not felt it a burden owing\r\nto my old training.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May I intend to go to Cilicia.\r\n\r\nmensem consumpsissem (atque utinam in pace! magnum enim bellum inpendet\r\na Parthis), Quinctilem in reditu ponere. Annuae enim mihi operae a. d.\r\nIII Kal. Sextil. emerentur. Magna autem in spe sum mihi nihil temporis\r\nprorogatum iri. Habebam acta urbana usque ad Nonas Martias; e quibus\r\nintellegebam Curionis nostri constantia omnia potius actum iri quam de\r\nprovinciis. Ergo, ut spero, prope diem te videbo.\r\n\r\nVenio ad Brutum tuum, immo nostrum; sic enim mavis. Equidem omnia feci,\r\nquae potui aut in mea provincia perficere aut in regno experiri. Omni\r\nigitur modo egi cum rege et ago cotidie per litteras scilicet. Ipsum\r\nenim triduum quadriduumve mecum habui turbulentis in rebus, quibus eum\r\nliberavi. Sed et tum praesens et postea creberrimis litteris non destiti\r\nrogare et petere mea causa, suadere et hortari sua. Multum profeci, sed\r\nquantum, non plane, quia longe absum, scio. Salaminios autem (hos enim\r\npoteram coërcere) adduxi, ut totum nomen Scaptio vellent solvere, sed\r\ncentesimis ductis a proxuma quidem syngrapha nec perpetuis, sed\r\nrenovatis quotannis. Numerabantur nummi: noluit Scaptius. Tu qui ais\r\nBrutum cupere aliquid perdere? Quaternas habebat in syngrapha. Fieri non\r\npoterat, nec, si posset, ego pati possem. Audio omnino Scaptium\r\n\r\nAfter spending the month of June there (and I pray it may be in peace,\r\nfor a serious war with the Parthians is certainly coming), July I shall\r\nspend on my journey home. I shall have served my year on July the 30th.\r\nI have great hopes that my tenure of office may not be extended. I have\r\nthe city gazette up to the 7th of March. I gather that, thanks to the\r\npersistence of my friend Curio, appointments to the province will be the\r\nlast business to be considered. So, as I hope, I shall see you soon.\r\n\r\nI come now to Brutus, your friend or rather mine, since you prefer it. I\r\nhave done everything that I could accomplish in my own province or\r\nattempt in the kingdom of Cappadocia. I have taken every measure with\r\nthe king and still do so daily—by letter. The king himself was in my\r\ncompany only for three or four days and at a crisis in his affairs, from\r\nwhich I released him. But both then in person and subsequently in\r\nrepeated letters I have continually begged and besought him in my own\r\nname and advised and persuaded him in his own interest. My efforts have\r\nborne fruit: but how much at this distance I cannot tell for certain.\r\nThe people of Salamis however, whom I could influence, I have induced to\r\nconsent to settle all their debt with Scaptius, but with interest at 12\r\nper cent calculated from the date of the last contract, and not at\r\nsimple but compound interest. The money was counted down: but Scaptius\r\nrefused to take it. What kind of a figure do you cut, who say that\r\nBrutus will make a sacrifice? Forty-eight per cent was written in the\r\nbond. It was an impossible sum. It could not be paid nor could I have\r\npermitted it. I hear after all that\r\n\r\npaenitere. Nam, quod senatus consultum esse dicebat, ut ius ex syngrapha\r\ndiceretur, eo consilio factum est, quod pecuniam Salaminii contra legem\r\nGabiniam sumpserant. Vetabat autem Auli lex ius dici de ita sumpta\r\npecunia. Decrevit igitur senatus, ut ius diceretur ex ista syngrapha.\r\nNunc ista habet iuris idem quod ceterae, nihil praecipui. Haec a me\r\nordine facta puto me Bruto probaturum; tibi nescio; Catoni certe\r\nprobabo.\r\n\r\nSed iam ad te ipsum revertor. Ain tandem, Attice, laudator integritatis\r\net elegantiae nostrae,\r\n\r\n                      “ausus es hoc ex ore tuo——,”\r\n\r\ninquit Ennius, ut equites Scaptio ad pecuniam cogendam darem, me rogare?\r\nAn tu, si mecum esses, qui scribis morderi te interdum, quod non simul\r\nsis, paterere me id facere, si vellem? “Non amplius,” inquis,\r\n“quinquaginta.” Cum Spartaco minus multi primo fuerunt. Quid tandem isti\r\nmali in tam tenera insula non fecissent? Non fecissent autem? immo quid\r\nante adventum meum non fecerunt? Inclusum in curia senatum habuerunt\r\nSalaminium ita multos dies, ut interierint non nulli fame. Erat enim\r\npraefectus Appi Scaptius et habebat turmas ab Appio. Id me igitur tu,\r\ncuius mehercule os mihi ante oculos solet versari, cum de aliquo officio\r\nac laude cogito, tu me, inquam, rogas, praefectus ut Scaptius sit? Alias\r\nhoc statueramus, ut negotiatorem neminem, idque Bruto probaramus. Habeat\r\nis turmas? Cur potius quam\r\n\r\nScaptius is sorry. As to his argument from a decree of the Senate\r\nordering judgement to be given according to the bond, the reason for\r\nthat was that in borrowing the money the people of Salamis contravened\r\nthe law of Gabinius. Aulus’ law forbade that judgement should be given\r\nfor money so borrowed. So the Senate decreed that judgement might be\r\ngiven on that particular bond. Now the bond in question has the same\r\nvalidity as other bonds, and no special privilege. I fancy Brutus will\r\nadmit that my behaviour has been proper. I do not know if you will take\r\nthat view, but certainly Cato will.\r\n\r\nNow I come back to yourself. My dear friend, you have praised the nice\r\nhonour of my conduct “and can you dare with your own mouth,” as Ennius\r\nsays, ask me to give Scaptius cavalry to collect his debts? Or would\r\nyou, if you were here,—you who say that you chafe sometimes at not being\r\nwith me,—would you suffer me to do such a thing, if I wanted? “Not more\r\nthan fifty men,” you say. Spartacus had fewer men than that at first.\r\nThe blackguards would have done indescribable damage in such a weak\r\nisland. Do you say, they would have refrained? Look at the damage they\r\ndid before I came here. They kept the members of the local Senate\r\nprisoners in their Chamber for so long that some died of hunger. For\r\nScaptius was a prefect of Appius, and was allowed some cavalry. Your\r\nface is always before my eyes, when I think of duty and honour, and can\r\nyou, you, I repeat, ask me to give the fellow the office of prefect? I\r\nhad settled in other cases never to give the office to a man of\r\nbusiness, a course which had won the approval of Brutus: and is a fellow\r\nlike Scaptius to have cavalry? Why should he not be content with a\r\n\r\ncohortes? Sumptu iam nepos evadit Scaptius. “Volunt,” inquit,\r\n“principes.” Scio; nam ad me Ephesum usque venerunt flentesque equitum\r\nscelera et miserias suas detulerunt. Itaque statim dedi litteras, ut ex\r\nCypro equites ante certam diem decederent, ob eamque causam, tum ob\r\nceteras Salaminii nos in caelum decretis suis sustulerunt. Sed iam quid\r\nopus equitatu? solvunt enim Salaminii; nisi forte id volumus armis\r\nefficere, ut faenus quaternis centesimis ducant. Et ego audebo legere\r\numquam aut attingere eos libros, quos tu dilaudas, si tale quid fecero?\r\nNimis, inquam, in isto Brutum amasti, dulcissime Attice, nos vereor ne\r\nparum. Atque haec scripsi ego ad Brutum scripsisse te ad me. Cognosce\r\nnunc cetera.\r\n\r\nPro Appio nos hic omnia facimus, honeste tamen, sed plane libenter. Nec\r\nenim ipsum odimus et Brutum amamus, et Pompeius mirifice a me contendit,\r\nquem mehercule plus plusque in dies diligo. C. Caelium quaestorem huc\r\nvenire audisti.

Valebis igitur et valere Piliam et Caeciliam nostrum iubebis\r\nlitteris et salvebis a meo Cicerone.\r\n\r\ncompany of foot? He is beginning to live in spendthrift style. The\r\nleading people of Salamis insist, he declares. Of course; that is why\r\nthey came to me and with tears told me of his men’s atrocities and their\r\nown miseries. Accordingly I sent a letter at once ordering the cavalry\r\nto quit Cyprus by a certain day, and that, as well as other acts of\r\nmine, has caused the people of Salamis to praise me to the skies in\r\ntheir decrees. There is no need of cavalry now, for the people are ready\r\nto pay,—unless perhaps I want to use force to make them pay 48 per cent\r\ninterest. Were I to do such a thing, I could never venture to read or\r\ntouch those volumes which you praise. You, my dear fellow, have had far\r\ntoo much regard for Brutus in the matter. I perhaps not enough. I have\r\ninformed Brutus of the drift of your letter. Now for the remaining\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to do all I can for Appius here consistently with my\r\nhonour. I do not dislike him and I like Brutus: and Pompey, for whom I\r\nhave a higher regard every day, is surprisingly importunate. You have\r\nheard that C. Caelius comes here as quaestor. I don’t know why, but I\r\ndon’t like that affair of Pammenes. I hope to be at Athens in the month\r\nof September. Please let me know the dates of your travels. I understood\r\nthe _naïveté_ of Sempronius Rufus from your letter written in Corcyra. I\r\nam really quite jealous of the influence Of Vestorius.\r\n\r\nI should like to keep on chatting, but day dawns, the crowd is pressing\r\nin and Philogenes is in a hurry. Good-bye, give my greetings to Pilia,\r\nwhen you write, and to your daughter: and accept greetings from my son.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Cilicia m.

Magna igitur, ut vides, sollicitudine\r\nadficior, magna inopia consilii.

First a thing which gives me much anxiety—not\r\nthat you can help me at all—for the business is in hand, and you are far\r\naway in a foreign land\r\n\r\n               “and by south wind tossed\r\n               Between us rolls the wide estranging sea.”\r\n\r\nThe days steal on, as you see (for I am due to leave my province on the\r\n30th of July), and no successor is appointed. Whom can I leave in\r\ncharge? Policy and public opinion point to my brother: first because it\r\nis right that he should have the honour by preference to anyone else,\r\nand secondly because he is the only officer of praetorian rank that I\r\nhave: for Pomptinus, who came out on that condition, has left me already\r\naccording to his agreement. My quaestor is notoriously unsuitable; he is\r\n“unsteady, wanton and lightfingered.” There is one objection to my\r\nbrother’s appointment,—he will probably refuse, as he hates provincial\r\nlife. Certes, it is a hateful bore. Then, supposing he does not like to\r\nrefuse, what is my proper course? Seeing that a great war is likely in\r\nSyria, which will apparently break forth into this district, where there\r\nis no protection and only the ordinary supplies have been voted for the\r\nyear, it would certainly seem unnatural to leave my brother, and\r\ncareless to leave some nincompoop. As you see I am troubled greatly and\r\nbadly want advice. In short I\r\n\r\ntoto negotio nobis opus non fuit. Quanto tua provincia melior! Decedes,\r\ncum voles, nisi forte iam decessisti; quem videbitur, praeficies\r\nThesprotiae et Chaoniae. Necdum tamen ego Quintum conveneram, ut iam, si\r\nid placeret, scirem, possetne ab eo impetrari: nee tamen, si posset,\r\nquid vellem, habebam. Hoc est igitur eius modi.\r\n\r\nReliqua plena adhuc et laudis et gratiae, digna iis libris, quos\r\ndilaudas, conservatae civitates, cumulate publicanis satis factum,\r\noffensus contumelia nemo, decreto iusto et severo perpauci, nec tamen\r\nquisquam, ut queri audeat, res gestae dignae triumpho; de quo ipso nihil\r\ncupide agemus, sine tuo quidem consilio certe nihil. Clausula est\r\ndifficilis in tradenda provincia. Sed haec deus aliquis gubernabit.\r\n\r\nDe urbanis rebus scilicet plura tu scis; saepius et certiora audis;\r\nequidem doleo non me tuis litteris certiorem fieri. Huc enim odiosa\r\nadferebantur de Curione, de Paulo; non quo ullum periculum videam stante\r\nPompeio vel etiam sedente, valeat modo; sed mehercule Curionis et Pauli,\r\nmeorum familiarium, vicem doleo. Formam igitur mihi totius rei publicae,\r\nsi iam es Romae aut cum eris, velim mittas, quae mihi obviam veniat, ex\r\nqua me fingere possim et praemeditari, quo animo accedam ad urbem. Est\r\nenim quiddam advenientem non esse peregrinum atque hospitem. Et, quod\r\npaene praeterii, Bruti tui causa,\r\n\r\nmade a mistake over the whole matter. Your sphere is far preferable. You\r\ncan depart at pleasure; and perhaps you have left already. You can put\r\nThesprotia and Chaonia[218] in charge of anyone you like. I have not yet\r\nmet my brother to know whether he would consent, if I want him to take\r\nit over; nor, should he consent, am I settled in my plans. So much for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe rest so far is full of honour and glory and worthy of the volumes\r\nwhich you praise. Communities have found salvation, the whole body of\r\ntax-collectors has been satisfied, no one has been annoyed by\r\nill-considered conduct, very few by the severity of upright justice—none\r\nso that he could dare complain—and a campaign has been conducted in a\r\nway that deserves a triumph, though I shall not seek it greedily, nor\r\nseek it at all without your advice. The conclusion is difficult in the\r\nmatter of handing over the province. But some god will direct my course.\r\n\r\nAbout doings in town of course you know more, as your information comes\r\nmore frequently and more surely. I am sorry that you do not pass on your\r\nnews in a letter, for tiresome tidings have reached me about Curio and\r\nPaulus, not that there would seem anything to fear, if Pompey keeps his\r\ninfluence or even his inactivity. Only let him recover his health. But I\r\nam annoyed for Curio and Paulus, my friends. So, if you are now in town,\r\nor when you are there, please send me a sketch of the political\r\nsituation to meet me on my way, that I may mould my conduct upon it and\r\nbethink me of the proper spirit in which to approach Rome. It is\r\nsomething not to arrive as a foreigner and a stranger. There was one\r\npoint I nearly omitted. As I have said often, I have\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  The country round Atticus’ house in Epirus.\r\n\r\nut saepe ad te scripsi, feci omnia. Cyprii numerabant; sed Scaptius\r\ncentesimis renovato in singulos annos faenore contentus non fuit.\r\nAriobarzanes non in Pompeium prolixior per ipsum quam per me in Brutum.\r\nQuem tamen ego praestare non poteram; erat enim rex perpauper, aberamque\r\nab eo ita longe, ut nihil possem nisi litteris; quibus pugnare non\r\ndestiti. Summa haec est. Pro ratione pecuniae liberalius est Brutus\r\ntractatus quam Pompeius. Bruto curata hoc anno talenta circiter c,\r\nPompeio in sex mensibus promissa cc. Iam in Appi negotio quantum\r\ntribuerim Bruto, dici vix potest. Quid est igitur, quod laborem? Amicos\r\nhabet meras nugas, Matinium, Scaptium. Qui quia non habuit a me turmas\r\nequitum, quibus Cyprum vexaret, ut ante me fecerat, fortasse suscenset,\r\naut quia praefectus non est, quod ego nemini tribui negotiatori, non C.\r\nVennonio, meo familiari, non tuo, M. Laenio, et quod tibi Romae\r\nostenderam me servaturum; in quo perseveravi. Sed quid poterit queri is,\r\nqui, auferre pecuniam cum posset, noluit? Scaptio, qui in Cappadocia\r\nfuit, puto esse satis factum. Is a me tribunatum cum accepisset, quem\r\nego ex Bruti litteris ei detulissem, postea scripsit ad me se uti nolle\r\neo tribunatu.\r\n\r\nGavius est quidam, cui cum praefecturam detulissem Bruti rogatu, multa\r\net dixit et fecit cum quadam mea contumelia, P. Clodi canis. Is me nec\r\nproficiscentem Apameam prosecutus est, nec, cum postea in castra\r\nvenisset atque inde discederet, num quid vellem, rogavit, et fuit aperte\r\nmihi nescio quare\r\n\r\ndone everything for your friend Brutus. The people of Cyprus were paying\r\ndown the money. Scaptius was not content with 12 per cent compound\r\ninterest. Ariobarzanes is not more accommodating to Pompey for his own\r\nsake than to Brutus for mine. Still I could not go bail for him, for he\r\nis a very needy monarch and I was such a long way off that I could only\r\npress him on paper, as I did continually. The conclusion is this. In\r\nproportion to the sum lent, Brutus has been treated more liberally than\r\nPompey: for Brutus there has been got this year about £24,400. To Pompey\r\nhas been promised £48,800 within six months. In the business of Appius,\r\nmy concessions to Brutus are almost incalculable. I have no reason to\r\ndistress myself. Brutus’ friends are men of straw, Matinius, and\r\nScaptius, who is perhaps angry because he could not get troops to harry\r\nCyprus as he had done before my time, or because he was not made a\r\nprefect, an office I have not granted to any man of business, not to C.\r\nVennonius, my friend, nor to your friend M. Laenius. I have persevered\r\nin the course that I told you at Rome I should keep: but a man who\r\nrefused to take his money, when he could, cannot grumble. The other\r\nScaptius who was in Cappadocia I think is satisfied. First of all he\r\naccepted a military tribuneship from me, which a letter from Brutus had\r\npersuaded me to offer him; but he wrote me afterwards that he did not\r\nwant to take it up.\r\n\r\nThere is a person Gavius, who, after I had offered him a post as prefect\r\nat Brutus’ request, said and did a good deal to disparage me. He is\r\nClodius’ puppydog. He did not condescend to be one of my escort when I\r\nleft Apamea, nor, when he came into camp later and was leaving it, did\r\nhe ask if I had any commissions. For some unknown reason he was an\r\n\r\nnon amicus. Hunc ego si in praefectis habuissem, quem tu me hominem\r\nputares? Qui, ut scis, potentissimorum hominum contumaciam numquam\r\ntulerim, ferrem huius adseculae? etsi hoc plus est quam ferre, tribuere\r\netiam aliquid beneficii et honoris. Is igitur Gavius, cum Apameae me\r\nnuper vidisset Romam proficiscens, me ita appellavit, ut Culleolum vix\r\nauderem: “Unde,” inquit, “me iubes petere cibaria praefecti?” Respondi\r\nlenius, quam putabant oportuisse, qui aderant, me non instituisse iis\r\ndare cibaria, quorum opera non essem usus. Abiit iratus. Huius nebulonis\r\noratione si Brutus moveri potest, licebit eum solus ames, me aemulum non\r\nhabebis. Sed illum eum futurum esse puto, qui esse debet. Tibi tamen\r\ncausam notam esse volui et ad ipsum haec perscripsi diligentissime.\r\nOmnino (soli enim sumus) nullas umquam ad me litteras misit Brutus, ne\r\nproxime quidem de Appio, in quibus non inesset adrogans, ἀκοινονόητον\r\naliquid. Tibi autem valde solet in ore esse:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lucilius.]\r\n\r\n                                        “Granius autem\r\n              Non contemnere se et reges odisse superbos.”\r\n\r\nIn quo tamen ille mihi risum magis quam stomachum movere solet. Sed\r\nplane parum cogitat, quid scribat aut ad quem.\r\n\r\nQ. Cicero puer legit, ut opinor, et certe, epistulam inscriptam patri\r\nsuo. Solet enim aperire idque de meo consilio, si quid forte sit, quod\r\nopus sit sciri. In ea autem epistula erat idem illud de sorore quod ad\r\nme. Mirifice conturbatum vidi puerum. Lacrimans\r\n\r\nopen enemy of mine. If I had counted such a fellow among my prefects,\r\nyou might doubt what kind of creature I am. You know I will not brook\r\ndiscourtesy from men of power, and should I put up with it from this\r\nhanger-on? Though, to be sure, gracious bestowal of honour is something\r\nmore than putting up with a man. So Gavius, when on his road to Rome he\r\nsaw me lately at Apamea, addressed me as I should scarcely address\r\nCulleolus. “Where,” said he, “am I to look for my pickings?” I answered\r\nless sternly than those present thought proper, that I was not\r\naccustomed to give pickings to men whose services I had not used. He\r\nwent off in a temper. If Brutus listens to the talk of such a shady\r\ncustomer, you may have him to yourself. I shall not be your rival. But I\r\nthink he will behave all right. However I wanted you to know the\r\ncircumstances, and I have recounted the matter very fully to Brutus.\r\nBetween ourselves Brutus has never sent me a letter, not even lately\r\nabout Appius, without a touch of arrogance and intolerance. You often\r\nquote the lines,\r\n\r\n                                      “But Granius too\r\n            Has self-conceit and hates the pride of kings.”\r\n\r\nHowever in this business he excites my laughter rather than my rage, and\r\nevidently he does not consider sufficiently what he writes and to whom.\r\n\r\nThe young Quintus, I fancy, yes I am sure, read your letter addressed to\r\nhis father, for he usually opens his father’s letters—and that by my\r\nadvice—in case there is anything he ought to know. The letter contained\r\nthat same passage about your sister that you wrote to me. The boy was\r\nawfully upset. He\r\n\r\nmecum est questus. Quid quaeris? miram in eo pietatem, suavitatem\r\nhumanitatemque perspexi. Quo maiorem spem habeo nihil fore aliter, ac\r\ndeceat. Id te igitur scire volui.\r\n\r\nNe illud quidem praetermittam. Hortensius filius fuit Laodiceae\r\ngladiatoribus flagitiose et turpiter. Hunc ego patris causa vocavi ad\r\ncenam, quo die venit, et eiusdem patris causa nihil amplius. Is mihi\r\ndixit se Athenis me exspectaturum, ut mecum decederet. “Recte,” inquam;\r\nquid enim dicerem? Omnino puto nihil esse, quod dixit; nolo quidem, ne\r\noffendam patrem, quem mehercule multum diligo.

I saw much good feeling in him, and a\r\nkind and courteous disposition, which increases my hope for a\r\nsatisfactory issue to the matter: so I want you to know it.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I must not pass over. The young Hortensius, during\r\nthe gladiatorial exhibition at Laodicea, behaved in a shameful and\r\nscandalous way. For his father’s sake I invited him to my table on the\r\nday of his arrival, and for the same father’s sake treated him\r\nhandsomely.[219] He said that he would await my departure in Athens,\r\nthat we might go home together. I could only say, “Very well.” But I\r\ndon’t fancy at all that he meant what he said. I hope not, lest I offend\r\nhis father, who is my very good friend. But if he comes in my suite, I\r\nwill arrange so as to avoid offence to a man I don’t want to offend.\r\n\r\nSo much for that, there is one thing more. Please send me Q. Celer’s\r\nspeech against M. Servilius. Write to me at your first opportunity. If\r\nthere is no news, write to say so, or even send a verbal message. Give\r\nmy love to your wife and daughter.

There I was upset by many troubles:\r\na big war in Syria, big cases of robbery in Cilicia, my difficulty in\r\narranging things, considering there are only a few days left of my year\r\nof office: but the hardest problem of all is that, according to a decree\r\nof the Senate, some one must be left\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  or “did nothing more for him.”\r\n\r\nqui praeesset. Nihil minus probari poterat quam quaestor Mescinius. Nam\r\nde Caelio nihil audiebamus. Rectissimum videbatur fratrem cum imperio\r\nrelinquere; in quo multa molesta, discessus noster, belli periculum,\r\nmilitum improbitas, sescenta praeterea. O rem totam odiosam!

Of\r\nCaelius I hear nothing. The proper thing seems to be to leave my brother\r\nwith military power, but that involves many difficulties—our separation,\r\nrisk of war, mutiny in the troops, a thousand other hazards. A hateful\r\nbusiness altogether. But fortune must look to it, since reason serves\r\nour purpose little.\r\n\r\nYou, having come safe to Rome, as I hope, will as usual look to\r\neverything that concerns me, especially the matter of my daughter, about\r\nwhose marriage settlement I have written to Terentia expressing my\r\nintentions, since you were in Greece. Then please look after my triumph.\r\nFor as you were absent from town, I fear the Senate hardly paid\r\nsufficient attention to my despatch.\r\n\r\nThe following point I will write to you in dark phrases: your cleverness\r\nwill scent my meaning. My wife’s freedman (you know whom I mean) seemed\r\nto me lately from casual words of his to have cooked his accounts on the\r\nsale of the goods of the Crotonian tyrannicide.[220] I fear you have\r\nnoticed something. Look into this matter yourself alone, and secure what\r\nis left. I cannot write all my fears. Take care that your letter flies\r\nto meet me. I write in haste on the march and with my army. Give my love\r\nto your wife and to your very charming little daughter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  T.

If you are, I am glad of your safe\r\narrival. So long as you were away from town, you seemed to me to be\r\nfurther off than if you were in Rome, for I heard less of my own\r\nbusiness and less of the business of the state. So please send plenty of\r\nchatty letters on every kind of subject to meet me, though I hope, when\r\nyou read this, I shall be well on my journey home. Above all write me on\r\nthe subject I raised in my former letter. From the stuttering hesitation\r\nof my wife’s freedman in our meetings and talks I infer that he has been\r\ncooking his accounts a little in the matter of the sale of the\r\nCrotonian’s[221] goods. Investigate the matter with your usual care, but\r\npay still more attention to this. When leaving the city of the seven\r\nhills he tendered an account of debts of some £100 and £200[222] to\r\nCamillus, and put himself down as owing £100 from Milo’s goods and £200\r\nfrom the property in the Chersonese, and as having inherited two sums of\r\n£2,600,[223] of which not a penny had been paid, though all were due on\r\nthe 1st of the second month. Milo’s freedman, Timotheus, the namesake of\r\nConon’s father, he said, had never given a thought to the matter. Now\r\nfirst try and secure the whole amount, and secondly don’t overlook the\r\ninterest from the afore-mentioned day. All the time I had to endure him,\r\nI was much upset. He came to me to spy out\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  i.e. T.

Reliqua vide et, quantum fieri potest,\r\nperspiciamus.\r\n\r\nEtsi annuum tempus prope iam emeritum habebamus (dies enim XXXIII erant\r\nreliqui), sollicitudine provinciae tamen vel maxime urgebamur. Cum enim\r\narderet Syria bello, et Bibulus in tanto maerore suo maximam curam belli\r\nsustineret, ad meque legati eius et quaestor et amici eius litteras\r\nmitterent, ut subsidio venirem, etsi exercitum infirmum habebam, auxilia\r\nsane bona, sed ea Galatarum, Pisidarum, Lyciorum (haec enim sunt nostra\r\nrobora), tamen esse officium meum putavi exercitum habere quam proxume\r\nhostem, quoad mihi praeesse provinciae per senatus consultum liceret.\r\nSed, quo ego maxime delectabar, Bibulus molestus mihi non erat, de\r\nomnibus rebus scribebat ad me potius. Et mihi decessionis dies λεληθότως\r\nobrepebat. Qui cum advenerit, ἄλλο πρόβλημα, quem praeficiam, nisi\r\nCaldus quaestor venerit; de quo adhuc nihil certi habebamus.\r\n\r\nCupiebam mehercule longiorem epistulam facere, sed nec erat res, de qua\r\nscriberem, nec iocari prae cura poteram.

When he lost them, he left without an\r\nexplanation, saying: “I give in, ’Twere shame to tarry long,” and\r\ncasting in my teeth the old proverb “take the goods the gods provide\r\nyou.”[224] Look after the rest, and let us investigate the matter as\r\nthoroughly as possible.\r\n\r\nThough I have nearly served my year (for only thirty-three days remain),\r\nstill I am greatly concerned about my province. Syria is ablaze with\r\nwar, and Bibulus is burdened with its cares in the midst of his own\r\ngreat sorrow,[225] and his legates, quaestor and friends write to me to\r\ngo to his aid: so, although the army I have is weak—the auxiliaries\r\ncertainly are good, Galatians, Pisidians, Lycians, the main strength of\r\nmy force—I have thought it my duty to keep an army facing the foe, so\r\nlong as I am authorized by the Senate’s decree to be in charge of my\r\nprovince. But what pleases me greatly is that Bibulus gives no trouble.\r\nHe writes to me about any other topic by preference, and the day of my\r\ndeparture creeps on unnoticed. When it arrives, there is the further\r\nproblem of my substitute, unless my quaestor Caldus comes, of whom so\r\nfar I have no news.\r\n\r\nI should like to write a longer letter, but I have no news, and care\r\nkeeps me from jesting; so good-bye, and love to your little daughter and\r\nto your wife.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  This proverb is referred to in Plato’s _Gorgias_ 499c, and given in\r\n  full by Olympiodorus in the form τὰ ἐκ τῆς τύχης διδόμενα κόσμει “make\r\n  the best of what fortune gives.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  The murder of his sons in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                           CICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

Sed, crede mihi, nihil minus putaram ego,\r\nqui de Ti. Nerone, qui mecum egerat, certos homines ad mulieres miseram;\r\nqui Romam venerunt factis sponsalibus. Sed hoc spero melius; mulieres\r\nquidem valde intellego delectari obsequio et comitate adulescentis.\r\nCetera noli ἐξακανθίζειν.\r\n\r\nSed heus tu! πυροὺς εἰς δῆμον Athenis? placet hoc tibi? Etsi non\r\nimpediebant mei certe libri. Non enim ista largitio fuit in cives, sed\r\nin hospites liberalitas. Me tamen de Academiae προπύλῳ iubes cogitare,\r\ncum iam Appius de Eleusine non cogitet? De Horterisio te certo scio\r\ndolere; equidem excrucior; decreram enim cum eo valde familiariter\r\nvivere.\r\n\r\nNos provinciae praefecimus Caelium. “Puerum,” inquies, “et fortasse\r\nfatuum et non gravem et non continentem!” Adsentior; fieri non potuit\r\naliter. Nam, quas multo ante tuas acceperam litteras, in quibus ἐπέχειν\r\nte scripseras, quid esset mihi faciendum de relinquendo, eae me\r\npungebant; videbam enim, quae tibi essent ἐποχῆς causae, et erant eaedem\r\nmihi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                      CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rhodes, circa Aug. 10_, B.C. _50_]\r\n\r\nWhile in my province I show Appius every honour, suddenly I find myself\r\nfather-in-law of Dolabella his accuser. You invoke heaven’s benison. So\r\nsay I, and you I know are sincere. Believe me, it was the last thing I\r\nhad expected. Indeed I had even sent trusty agents to Terentia and\r\nTullia about the suit of Ti. Nero, who had made proposals to me: but\r\nthey arrived in town only when the betrothal was over. However I hope\r\nthe better course has been taken. I understand that my women folk are\r\nhighly pleased with the young man’s obliging and courteous temper. As\r\nfor the rest, don’t pick holes in him.\r\n\r\nGood gracious! Do you approve of corn doles to Athens? My own books to\r\nbe sure do not forbid such a dole, for it was not a largesse to\r\nfellow-citizens, but a graceful present in return for hospitality. Still\r\ndo you encourage me in the matter of the porch for the Academy, when\r\nAppius has abandoned his design of a porch at Eleusis? I am sure you are\r\nsorry about the news of Hortensius. Personally I am distracted: for it\r\nhad been my intention to live on intimate terms with him.\r\n\r\nI have put Caelius in charge of my province. “A mere boy” you will\r\nobject, “and perhaps silly, and lacking in dignity and self-control.” I\r\nagree; but there was no alternative. The letter I got from you some time\r\nago, in which you said you suspended judgement as to what I ought to do\r\nabout my substitute, caused me a pang; for I understood the grounds\r\n\r\nPuero tradere? fratri autem? Illud non utile nobis. Nam praeter fratrem\r\nnemo erat, quem sine contumelia quaestori, nobili praesertim,\r\nanteferrem. Tamen, dum impendere Parthi videbantur, statueram fratrem\r\nrelinquere aut etiam rei publicae causa contra senatus consultum ipse\r\nremanere. Qui posteaquam incredibili felicitate discesserunt, sublata\r\ndubitatio est. Videbam sermones: “Hui, fratrem reliquit! Num est hoc non\r\nplus annum obtinere provinciam? Quid, quod senatus eos voluit praeesse\r\nprovinciis, qui non praefuissent? At hic triennium!” Ergo haec ad\r\npopulum. Quid, quae tecum? Numquam essem sine cura, si quid iracundius\r\naut contumeliosius aut neglegentius, quae fert vita hominum. Quid, si\r\nquid filius puer et puer bene sibi fidens? qui esset dolor? quem pater\r\nnon dimittebat teque id censere moleste ferebat. At nunc Caelius non\r\ndico equidem “quod egerit—,” sed tamen multo minus laboro. Adde illud.\r\nPompeius, eo robore vir, iis radicibus, Q. Cassium sine sorte delegit,\r\nCaesar Antonium; ego sorte datum offenderem, ut etiam inquireret in eum,\r\nquem reliquissem? Hoc melius, et huius rei plura exempla, senectuti\r\nquidem nostrae profecto aptius.\r\n\r\nof your hesitation and felt them myself. Could I hand it over to a boy?\r\nBut ought I to hand it over to my brother? The latter is prejudicial to\r\nmy own interests. My brother was the only man it would not be an insult\r\nto prefer to the quaestor, especially as that officer was of noble\r\nbirth. Still, while the Parthians seemed threatening, I determined to\r\nleave my brother in charge, or even to run counter to the decree of the\r\nSenate and for the sake of the Republic remain here myself. Their\r\nmarvellously opportune retirement removed my doubts. I foresaw the\r\nworld’s comment. “So he has left his brother in charge! Is this holding\r\na province for one year only? And what about the decree of the Senate\r\nthat ex-governors should not be eligible? Why, his brother was governor\r\nfor three years.” These are the arguments for the public; but for you I\r\nhave private reasons. I should have been in constant anxiety as to some\r\nexhibition of temper or overbearingness or negligence; for such things\r\nwill happen. Perhaps his son, a mere headstrong lad, would have given me\r\ncause for distress: his father would not send him away, and was annoyed\r\nwith you for saying that he ought. As for Caelius, I cannot say that I\r\nam unconcerned about his past behaviour: but still I am far less\r\nconcerned. Then there is another point. Pompey (and think of his power\r\nand position) chose Q. Cassius without regard to the lot, and Caesar too\r\nchose Antony. I could not affront Caelius who had been given to me by\r\nlot, and so make him a spy on the actions of my successor. No; my\r\npresent course is better, accords well with precedent and is well suited\r\nto my time of life. But,\r\n\r\nAt te apud eum, di boni, quanta in gratia posui.

As to this legacy from Precius, which is a great sorrow to\r\nme—for I loved him indeed—don’t let the fellow lay a finger on it, small\r\nas it is. You will say that I want money for the outfit of my triumph.\r\nYou shall see that following your advice I will not show foolish vanity\r\nin seeking a triumph, nor be phlegmatic enough to refuse it.\r\n\r\nI gather from your letter that you heard from Turranius I had given over\r\nmy province to my brother. Do you imagine that I overlooked the cautious\r\ntone of your letter? You wrote that you were doubtful. There could have\r\nbeen no reason for doubts, if there had been grounds for leaving a\r\nbrother and such a brother in charge. I took your doubts for dogmatic\r\nrejection. You warn me on no account to leave the young Quintus. Your\r\nwords repeat my dream. The same vision came to us both, as though we had\r\ntalked it over. There was nothing else to be done, and your long doubt\r\nhas relieved me of hesitation. But I fancy you must have already got a\r\nletter on this topic written in more detail.\r\n\r\nEgo tabellarios postero die ad vos eram missurus; quos puto ante\r\nventures quam nostrum Saufeium. Sed eum sine meis litteris ad te venire\r\nvix rectum erat. Tu mihi, ut polliceris, de Tulliola mea, id est de\r\nDolabella, perscribes, de re publica, quam praevideo in summis\r\npericulis, de censoribus, maximeque de signis, tabulis quid fiat,\r\nreferaturne. Idibus Octobribus has dedi litteras, quo die, ut scribis,\r\nCaesar Placentiam legiones IIII. Quaeso, quid nobis futurum est? In arce\r\nAthenis statio mea nunc placet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             END OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\nI mean to send letter-carriers to you to-morrow, who I fancy will arrive\r\nbefore our friend Saufeius: but it was hardly proper that he should come\r\nto you without a letter from me. Please write me fully, as you promise,\r\nabout my little daughter, that is about her husband Dolabella, about the\r\npolitical situation in which I foresee much trouble, about the censors,\r\nand above all about the business of statues and pictures, and whether\r\nthe matter will come up before the Senate.[230] The 15th of October is\r\nthe date of this letter, a day on which you say Caesar is going to bring\r\nfour legions to Placentia. I wonder what will be our fate. My present\r\nquarters on the Acropolis at Athens seem to me the best place.\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  The censors had fixed a limit on private expenditure on works of art:\r\n  but their edict required the confirmation of the Senate before it\r\n  became law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF THE LETTERS.[231]\r\n\r\n\r\n   I. 5 November, 68[232]\r\n\r\n      6 November or December, 68\r\n\r\n      7 February, 67\r\n\r\n      8 February, 67\r\n\r\n      9 February, 67\r\n\r\n      10 Before July, 67\r\n\r\n      11 July or August, 67\r\n\r\n      3 Late in 67\r\n\r\n      4 Early in 66\r\n\r\n      1 July, 65\r\n\r\n      2 July, 65\r\n\r\n      12 January 1, 61\r\n\r\n      13 January 25, 61\r\n\r\n      14 February 13, 61\r\n\r\n      15 March 15, 61\r\n\r\n      16 June, 61\r\n\r\n      17 December 5, 61\r\n\r\n      18 January 20, 60\r\n\r\n      19 March 15, 60\r\n\r\n      20 May, 60\r\n\r\n  II. 1 June, 60\r\n\r\n      2 December, 60\r\n\r\n      3 December, 60\r\n\r\n      10 March 29, 59\r\n\r\n      4 April, 59\r\n\r\n      5 April, 59\r\n\r\n      6 April, 59\r\n\r\n      7 April, 59\r\n\r\n      8 April, 59\r\n\r\n      9 April, 59\r\n\r\n      12 April 18, 59\r\n\r\n      11 April, 59\r\n\r\n      13 April 23, 59\r\n\r\n      14 April, 59\r\n\r\n      15 April, 59\r\n\r\n      16 May, 59\r\n\r\n      17 May, 59\r\n\r\n      18 June or July, 59\r\n\r\n      19 July-October, 59\r\n\r\n      20 July-October, 59\r\n\r\n      21 July-October, 59\r\n\r\n      22 July-October, 59\r\n\r\n      23 July-October, 59\r\n\r\n      24 Before October 18, 59\r\n\r\n      25 Before November 1, 59\r\n\r\n III. 3 April 5(?),58\r\n\r\n      2 April 8, 58\r\n\r\n      5 April 10 (?), 58\r\n\r\n      4 April 13, 58\r\n\r\n      1 April, 58\r\n\r\n      6 April 17, 58\r\n\r\n      7 April 29, 58\r\n\r\n      8 May 29, 58\r\n\r\n      9 June 13, 58\r\n\r\n      10 June 17, 58\r\n\r\n      11 June 27, 58\r\n\r\n      12 July 17, 58\r\n\r\n      14 July 21, 58\r\n\r\n      13 August 5, 58\r\n\r\n      15 August 17, 58\r\n\r\n      16 August 19, 58\r\n\r\n      17 September 4, 58\r\n\r\n      18 September, 58\r\n\r\n      19 September 15, 58\r\n\r\n      20 October 4, 58\r\n\r\n      21 October 28, 58\r\n\r\n      22 November 25, 58\r\n\r\n      23 November 29, 58\r\n\r\n      24 December 10, 58\r\n\r\n      25 December, 58\r\n\r\n      26 January, 57\r\n\r\n      27 January, 57\r\n\r\n  IV. 1 September, 57\r\n\r\n      2 October, 57\r\n\r\n      3 November 23, 57\r\n\r\n      4 January 28, 56\r\n\r\n      4a April or May, 56\r\n\r\n      5 April or May, 56\r\n\r\n      6 April or May, 56\r\n\r\n      7 April or May, 56\r\n\r\n      8 April or May, 56\r\n\r\n      8a Autumn, 56\r\n\r\n      10 April 22, 55\r\n\r\n      9 April 27, 55\r\n\r\n      11 May, 55\r\n\r\n      12 May, 55\r\n\r\n      13 November 14, 55\r\n\r\n      14 May 10, 54\r\n\r\n      16 June or July, 54\r\n\r\n      15 July 27, 54\r\n\r\n      17 October 1, 54\r\n\r\n      18 October, 54\r\n\r\n      19 November, 54\r\n\r\n   V. 1 May 5 or 6, 51\r\n\r\n      2 May 10, 51\r\n\r\n      3 May 11, 51\r\n\r\n      4 May 12, 51\r\n\r\n      5 May 15, 51\r\n\r\n      6 May 19, 51\r\n\r\n      7 May 20, 51\r\n\r\n      8 June 2 or 3, 51\r\n\r\n      9 June 14, 51\r\n\r\n      10 June 29 or July 1, 51\r\n\r\n      11 July 6, 51\r\n\r\n      12 July, 51\r\n\r\n      13 July 26, 51\r\n\r\n      14 July 27, 51\r\n\r\n      15 August 3, 51\r\n\r\n      16 August, 51\r\n\r\n      17 August, 51\r\n\r\n      18 September 20, 51\r\n\r\n      19 September 20, 51\r\n\r\n      20 December, 51\r\n\r\n      21 February 13, 50\r\n\r\n  VI. 1 February 24, 50\r\n\r\n      2 May, 50\r\n\r\n      3 June, 50\r\n\r\n      4 June, 50\r\n\r\n      5 June 26, 50\r\n\r\n      7 July, 50\r\n\r\n      6 August, 10 (?) 50\r\n\r\n      8 October 1, 50\r\n\r\n      9 October 15, 50\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  In many cases the dates and order are only approximate and authorities\r\n  differ about them.
