Its story, therefore, rivals in interest\r\nthose of the great wars of the past which have been an unceasing\r\ninspiration in every field of art and literature. The political\r\nmachinations of great and little kings, of famed prime ministers, of\r\npeoples and states have attracted attention in more or less limited\r\ncircles, but the world's wars have appealed to every class and rank.\r\nThe world's vast army of readers have never wearied of the classic\r\nstories of feats of arms by men and armies told of the dawning days of\r\nworld history; the tales of later map-making struggles of Asia, of\r\nEurope, of America, have never grown old or dull. So in the Orient of\r\nto-day. The great political battles which have centred about China and\r\nJapan for the last half century have interested the few. But to-day the\r\nattention of the world is centred on the lands bordering the Pacific,\r\nbecause a war has waged; because the whole human family loves the\r\nstories of valorous deeds, of military achievement, of the\r\nhistory-making that is done with the sword.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this volume is to bring American readers face to face\r\nwith the events of the struggle of such stupendous magnitude, now drawn\r\nto a close. From battlefield to battlefield the author carries his\r\nthrilling narrative, bringing the scenes before the mind's eye as only\r\none could do who stood within sound of the roaring guns, within sight\r\nof the onrush of resistless battalions, elbow to elbow with Japan's\r\nbrilliant history makers. From the opening of the struggle to its close\r\nthere was never a moment when stupendous events were not either in the\r\nprocess of making or so imminent that the civilized world held its\r\nbreath. A single year's campaign in Manchuria and around famed Port\r\nArthur furnish three land battles, greater in the number engaged in the\r\nawful cost of life, in the period of duration, than is presented by all\r\nof the pages of history. The siege of Port Arthur has no duplicate\r\namong all recorded military achievements. The opening of the second\r\nyear of the war added a battle, that at Mukden, so vast, so brilliant\r\nfrom the standpoint of the victors, so disastrous from the standpoint\r\nof the defeated, that it has been accorded by masters of strategy a\r\nniche by itself in the chronicles of war. The author saw this wonderful\r\npanorama of events unfolded. His story bristles with dramatic touches,\r\nflashes of enlightening description that bring the scene home to the\r\nreader with a vividness that thrills.\r\n\r\nAmerican readers have a more immediate interest in the struggle than\r\nthe universal love of the stories of battle. With Japan victor over\r\nRussia, with the great Muscovite Empire deprived of a foothold on the\r\nPacific, Japan and America remain the only Powers there to divide the\r\nrich spoils of Oriental commerce. Our possessions, the Philippines, are\r\nJapan's nearest neighbors, and their proximity to Japan, their bearing\r\nupon the Asiatic problem open the way for events of more than ordinary\r\nimportance, if not of seriousness. Already the statement has been made\r\nthat Japan covets these Islands. Will the United States, one day be\r\ncalled upon to go to war in their behalf? The question is one which no\r\nAmerican can ignore. The nation must educate itself to decide one day,\r\nthe issue, for or against a struggle with this wonderful little Empire,\r\nthe Great Britain of Asia. The volume, therefore, in addition to its\r\nvalue and interest as a chronicle of a marvelous series of bloody\r\nbattles is educational, the pioneer, blazing the way to an appreciation\r\nof events, of possibilities for our own country which lie in the story\r\nof Japan's overwhelming success. Will the Mikado come to believe that\r\nhaving humbled and crushed what was Europe's mightiest Power, he can as\r\nreadily drive from the Pacific the American Republic?\r\n\r\nThe author in this volume has even more completely demonstrated his\r\ngenius as a chronicler of war than in any of his earlier efforts. Step\r\nby step he followed the British in Africa and at the conclusion of that\r\nstruggle contributed to British literature a history which was\r\ngenerally conceded to have been more accurate, more graphic, less\r\nwarped by prejudices than any other. Step by step he followed the\r\nunfolding of our own Spanish war and the story of that struggle as told\r\nby Mr. Tyler became at once the standard not only in Great Britain, but\r\nin the several Continental countries in which it appeared. With the\r\npriceless experience of these two wars to ably equip him, Mr. Tyler has\r\ncontributed one more narrative of a great war to military literature\r\nand the assertion is unhesitatingly made that it will not be equalled\r\nby any of the hosts of volumes destined to be written of this memorable\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAlong with the author went his camera. To that fact the reader is\r\nindebted to a series of illustrations never before attempted in the\r\nportrayal of military campaigns. What little the author has left to the\r\nimagination is supplied by these graphic pictures that bridge nine\r\nthousand miles and bring the sights and almost the sounds of battle to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nIn brief, this volume as a description of the succeeding struggles of\r\nthe Japan-Russia War, for accuracy, graphic qualities, detail and\r\nliterary finish; for its educational value and significance, for the\r\nhitherto unattempted excellence of its illustration is presented to the\r\nAmerican public with confidence that an appreciative reception will not\r\npossibly be denied.\r\n\r\n                                                         THE PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

The great\r\ninternecine struggle in the United States in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, the disastrous duel between France and Germany which followed,\r\nand England's recently-concluded campaign in South Africa, have each,\r\nindeed, left a deep mark upon history. But while their import was at\r\nmost Continental, if not local, the conflict between Japan and Russia\r\nis fraught with consequences which must inevitably be world-wide in\r\nscope. There is no civilized Power in either hemisphere whose interests\r\nare not more or less directly concerned in the question--Who shall be\r\nthe dominant Power in the China Seas? For the whole course of the\r\nworld's development in that quarter must depend on whether the mastery\r\nremains to the obstructive and oppressive Colossus of the North or to\r\nthe progressive and enlightened island-Empire which, like Pallas in\r\nPagan myth, has sprung fully armed from an ancient civilization into\r\nthe very van of modern progress. It was no mere dynastic jealousy or\r\nracial animosity that brought about this fateful collision. It was the\r\ninevitable antagonism of two irreconcilable destinies. \"Two stars keep\r\nnot their motion in one sphere\"; and the ambitions of Russia and the\r\naspirations of Japan cannot find room for fulfilment together. One or\r\nthe other must be crushed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two Irreconcilable Destinies]\r\n\r\nFor Japan, the question is one of national existence. With Russia\r\nestablished in Manchuria and dominating the Yellow Sea, the absorption\r\nof Korea becomes a mere matter of time; and then the very independence\r\nof Japan would be subject to a perpetual and intolerable menace; while\r\nthe new life which has dawned for its wonderfully gifted people would\r\nbe crushed at the outset. But if Japan is fighting for her life, Russia\r\nis fighting for something almost as precious--the consummation of an\r\nambition which has been the dream and the fixed goal of her statesmen\r\nfor more than a generation. The expansion of the Russian Empire has\r\nbeen steadily eastwards; and the further conquest and dominion have\r\nspread, the more has the necessity been felt for an outlet to the\r\nnavigable seas. Unless all the labor and sacrifices of years are to be\r\nin vain, and the great Siberian Empire is to remain a mere gigantic\r\n_cul-de-sac_, Russia must establish herself permanently in the Gulf of\r\nPechili, and find in its ice-free ports that natural outlet for her\r\ntrans-continental railway which will enable the life-blood of commerce\r\nto circulate through her torpid bulk. The struggle, therefore, was one\r\nbetween two irreconcilable destinies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress v. Stagnation]\r\n\r\nBut if the issue was immediately of such paramount significance to the\r\ntwo combatants, it was only less charged with import for all Asia,\r\nEurope and America. The victory of Japan would incontestably give her\r\nthe predominance in the Far East, commercially as well as politically.\r\nNot only would she be a formidable trade rival to the European nations\r\nwhose methods she has so successfully adopted, but she would be able to\r\ninfluence the conditions under which that trade was carried on. The\r\nimmensely valuable and as yet imperfectly developed market of China\r\nwould be practically within her control; and European Powers would no\r\nlonger be able with impunity to seize naval bases and proclaim\r\nexclusive spheres of influence in Chinese territory. On the other hand,\r\nif Russia were to emerge victorious from the war, the whole of China\r\nwould become a mere vassal state, if indeed its integrity could be\r\npreserved. Trade would be discouraged and finally extinguished by the\r\nexclusive methods of Russian policy, and except on sufferance no other\r\nPower could obtain a footing in the Far East. The whole future of this\r\nvast region, therefore, hung in the balance, for the battle was between\r\nfreedom, progress and enlightenment, as represented by Japan, and\r\nobscurantism, oppression and stagnation, as represented by Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Europe's Danger]\r\n\r\nBut the anxious concern of the world in this Far Eastern war was based\r\nnot only upon a calculation of material interests. Every civilized\r\nGovernment had before its eyes the imminent danger of other countries\r\nbeing dragged into the conflict. The situation was such that at any\r\nmoment some untoward incident might set Europe in a blaze. The specific\r\nobligations of France to Russia under the terms of the Dual Alliance,\r\nand of Great Britain to Japan under the Treaty of Alliance concluded in\r\n1901, made the limitation of the struggle to the original combatants\r\nnot only difficult, but even precarious. A breach of neutrality by any\r\nthird Power would at once have compelled France to join forces with her\r\nRussian ally, or Great Britain to come to the assistance of Japan. Such\r\na breach might have been merely trivial or technical, and yet\r\nsufficient to give a hard-pressed belligerent ground for calling her\r\nally to her assistance. It might even have been deliberately provoked,\r\nin the hope of retrieving disaster by extending the area of conflict;\r\nand if the two Western Powers were once dragged into war, no statesman\r\nwould be bold enough to put a limit to the consequences. Both Germany\r\nand the United States are profoundly interested in the Far East and in\r\nthe issue of this great struggle for predominance; and one or both of\r\nthem might at any moment have been ranged on one side or the other.\r\nFrom such an Armageddon the factors which determine the balance of\r\npower throughout the world, and therefore the development of national\r\ndestinies, could hardly have emerged without profound modification; and\r\nthe ultimate establishment of peace would have found many more\r\ninternational rivalries and antagonisms resolved than those which are\r\nimmediately connected with the Far East. Lord Beaconsfield once said\r\nthat there were only two events in history--the Siege of Troy and the\r\nFrench Revolution. It seems more than possible that the Russo-Japanese\r\nwar will have to be reckoned as a third supreme factor in the progress\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insatiable Russia]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the present war became practically inevitable as long\r\nago as 1895, when, on the conclusion of peace between China and Japan\r\nthe three European Powers--Russia, France and Germany--stepped in and\r\nrobbed the Mikado and his people of the fruits of their hard-earned\r\nvictory. From that time up to the present Russia has steadily, and\r\nwithout ceasing, tightened her grip upon the Northern province of the\r\nhapless Chinese Empire, and has ended by threatening the independence\r\nof Korea, the legitimate sphere of influence of Japan, and the\r\nindispensable buffer between herself and the insatiable and\r\never-advancing Northern Power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Warm Water Port]\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the determining consideration which led\r\nRussia to cast longing eyes upon Manchuria--apart from that eternal\r\nhunger for territory which is one of her strongest characteristics--was\r\nthe necessity of acquiring a warm water port as a naval base and\r\ncommercial harbor. The port of Vladivostock--which, by the way, she\r\nacquired from China as early as 1860 by a truly Russian piece of\r\nbluff--has proved of little use in this respect, owing to the fact that\r\nduring the winter months it is almost entirely icebound. A striking\r\nillustration of the embarrassment such a state of things must cause was\r\nafforded in the course of the present war by the plight into which the\r\nRussian Cruiser Squadron stationed there fell. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the ambitions of the Czar's advisers had for years been directed\r\ntowards the acquisition of the fortress and harbor of Port Arthur\r\n(known to the Chinese as Lu-shun-kau), which situated as it is upon the\r\nnarrow neck of land at the extreme southernmost point of the Liao-tung\r\nPeninsula, should, if properly served by a strong and efficient naval\r\nforce, dominate the Gulf of Pechili, and prove the most powerful\r\nstrategic post in Northern China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Warlike Progress]\r\n\r\nIt is not known, of course, what path the development of Russian plans\r\nin this respect would have followed if they had been allowed to proceed\r\nwithout interruption; but, as it turned out, they were suddenly\r\nthreatened with a dangerous obstacle in the complete and unexpected\r\nsuccess of Japan over China and her capture of the whole of the\r\nLiao-tung Peninsula. This short but sanguinary conflict between China\r\nand Japan is memorable for having first revealed to the world the\r\namazing progress which Japan had made in her efforts to engraft and\r\nassimilate the characteristics of Western civilization. It proved that\r\nin less than twenty years Japan had earned for herself an established\r\nposition in the community of progressive nations. The war also made it\r\npossible for the first time to estimate the influence and effect in\r\nwarlike operations of the tremendous engines of destruction with which\r\nmodern science has equipped the fleets and armies of to-day. The navy\r\nof Japan had been organized on the latest model, and her officers had\r\nbeen trained in British schools; and though China's equipment was not\r\nto be compared with that of her antagonist, she possessed several\r\npowerful armorclads of the latest type, officered and engineered by\r\nexperienced Europeans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chino-Japanese War]\r\n\r\nThe salient features of the war were, at sea, the battles of the Yalu\r\nRiver and of Wei-hai-Wei; and on land, the rout of the Chinese at\r\nPing-Yang, the passage of the Yalu and storming of Port Arthur. The\r\nfirst of these in order of time was the battle of Ping-Yang, a town\r\nsituated near the north-west coast of Korea. Here the Chinese troops\r\nunder General Tso attempted to prevent the advance of the Japanese\r\ntowards the Yalu. By a series of skilful movements carried out on\r\nSeptember 15th and 16th, 1894, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief, Marshal\r\nYamagata, completely surrounded the Chinese and defeated them with\r\ngreat slaughter, their General himself falling dead upon the field. On\r\nthe next day the Chinese fleet stationed at the mouth of the Yalu,\r\nwhich had proved entirely ineffective in preventing the landing of the\r\nenemy's forces upon Korea, gave battle to the Japanese. The ships of\r\nthe latter Power were mainly cruisers, but the extraordinary skill with\r\nwhich they were manoeuvred and the rapidity of their fire completely\r\noutweighed the advantage possessed by the Chinese Admiral in\r\nbattleships. He sustained a crushing defeat, and eight of his best\r\nvessels were destroyed. In the meanwhile Marshal Yamagata continued his\r\nmarch to the North, and after a bloody but indecisive conflict near\r\nWiju on October 22nd he succeeded in crossing the Yalu River and\r\ndriving his antagonists in rout before him. The Japanese now proceeded\r\nto overrun Manchuria and the Liao-tung Peninsula, capturing all the\r\nprincipal positions one after the other with unvarying success. A great\r\narmy under Marshal Oyama invested Port Arthur in November, and on the\r\n20th and 21st he took that powerful fortress by storm, the defenders\r\nbeing massacred to a man. The final and decisive act of the war was the\r\nbombardment of Wei-hai-Wei and the island fortress of Leu-Kung-tan by\r\nthe combined naval and military forces of Admiral Ito and Marshal\r\nOyama. The operations lasted from January 30th, 1895, till February\r\n12th, when, unable to hold out any longer against the terrific assault,\r\nAdmiral Ting, the Chinese Commander, surrendered his fleet and the\r\nforts under honors of war. A closing touch of tragedy was the suicide\r\nof Ting and his principal officers, unable to bear the shame of their\r\ndefeat. On March 19th negotiations for peace were opened at\r\nShimonoseki, and the final treaty was signed on April 17th. The Treaty\r\nof Shimonoseki gave Japan unqualified possession of that Peninsula and\r\nalso, of course, of Port Arthur--a very moderate territorial prize,\r\nconsidering the absolute character of her victory over China, and the\r\nsacrifices she had made to obtain it. But Russian susceptibilities were\r\nalarmed, and the Government of St. Petersburg decided upon a drastic\r\nstep to avert the calamity which threatened to render its ambitions\r\nfutile. Gaining the support of both Germany and France, it compelled\r\nJapan, by threats of force which that Power could not resist, to retire\r\nfrom Port Arthur and the Liao-tung Peninsula, and to restore the\r\nterritory to China. The reason alleged for this high-handed action was\r\nthe specious plea that the presence of the Japanese on the Asiatic\r\nmainland would endanger the independence of China and Korea, and would\r\nbe a constant menace to the peace of the Far East. Naturally enough the\r\nindignation of Japan was intense, but defiance of three such powerful\r\nantagonists was impossible for her at that moment, isolated as she was\r\nand exhausted by the exertions of a great war. Great Britain was asked\r\nby the other three Powers to act jointly with them in this matter, but\r\nshe refused to assist in depriving the gallant Island people of their\r\nrightful spoils of victory. The attitude of Lord Rosebery's Government\r\non this occasion, although it gave no positive aid to Japan,\r\nundoubtedly led to a better understanding between the two countries,\r\nand paved the way ultimately to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Alliance,\r\nwhich, by rescuing Japan from her position of isolation, enabled her to\r\nenter effectively into the momentous and complicated game which the\r\nEuropean diplomatists were playing, with varying fortunes, at Peking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia's \"Honor\"]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Japanese aspirations received a check from which\r\nthey were to take several years to recover. The statesmen of the Mikado\r\nwere even unable to obtain a pledge from China that the territories\r\nyielded back to her by Japan would never be alienated to a third Power.\r\nRussia's delicate sense of honor, it appeared, revolted against the\r\nimputation implied, and therefore China must give no pledge. On the\r\nother hand, Russia would be so generous as to give an assurance on her\r\nown account that she had no designs upon Manchuria. Forced to content\r\nherself with the cold comfort of this empty and meaningless\r\ndeclaration, and baffled upon all essential points, Japan sullenly\r\nwithdrew her troops from the mainland and settled down to nurse her\r\njust wrath, and prepare for the inevitable day of reckoning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE INFANTRY ATTACKING A CHINESE POSITION.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Pavloff]\r\n\r\nThe centre of interest was now shifted to Peking, where began that\r\namazing scramble among the European Powers for commercial, and\r\nespecially for railway, concessions in China, which, by unmasking the\r\nambitions of some countries, and revealing the community of interests\r\nof others, has led ultimately to important modifications of\r\ninternational policy, and to a re-arrangement of alliances. The\r\ncomplexity of the game, the swiftness of the moves, and the ignorance\r\nof the average man, not only of the issues involved, but even of the\r\nmain geographical and economic features of the immense country which\r\nwas the object of the struggle--all contrived to puzzle the mind and to\r\ndarken the understanding; but a vague feeling, only too clearly\r\njustified by the events, arose in this country that England and America\r\nwere not getting the best of the conflict, and that Russia and Germany\r\nwere making all the running. In truth, there is no doubt that the\r\nskill, or perhaps, to speak more correctly, the duplicity, of the\r\nRussian diplomatists both in Peking and in St. Petersburg left their\r\ncompetitors completely behind. Foremost among them there emerges at\r\nthis time the sinister figure of M. Pavloff, the Minister of the Czar\r\nat the Chinese Court. The tortuous diplomacy of the Muscovite has\r\nproduced no more characteristic tool. M. Pavloff has been the stormy\r\npetrel of the Far East. Intrepid, resourceful to a degree, unscrupulous\r\nbeyond the average, he is ever in the forefront of the diplomatic\r\nbattle line. His appearance in any part of the field is the signal for\r\nnew combinations, fresh aggressions, the stirring up of bad blood\r\nbetween nations, and the unsettlement of apparently settled questions.\r\nA man whose god is the Czar; a man with whom the expansion of the\r\nEmpire of the Little White Father is an ideal cherished with almost\r\nreligious fervor; a man who indeed in all probability honestly regards\r\nthe extension of the Russian autocracy over the world as essential to\r\nthe due progress of higher civilization--he is thoroughly typical of\r\nthe class of agents whose devoted services Russia has always managed to\r\nsecure for the spread of her Empire and the gradual but steady\r\nabsorption of fresh territory all over Asia, whether in China, Persia,\r\nTurkestan or Tibet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia in China]\r\n\r\nSuch was the instrument possessed by the Government of the Czar at the\r\nCourt of Peking, and he was not likely to neglect the unique\r\nopportunity which lay ready to his hand. By her action in restoring\r\nPort Arthur to the nerveless grasp of China, Russia naturally assumed\r\nthe character of a powerful friend whose smile was to be courted and\r\nwhose frown was to be proportionately dreaded. What more natural, in\r\nthe circumstances, than that the Emperor should grant to the subjects\r\nof his brother and ally, the Czar, peculiar commercial privileges in\r\nthe country which had been so generously rescued from the grip of Japan\r\nand restored to the Empire of the King of Heaven?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE WAR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russo-Chinese Bank]\r\n\r\nThe first result of M. Pavloff's policy of disinterested friendship\r\nbecame manifest in 1896, when the Chinese Government concluded an\r\nagreement with the Russo-Chinese Bank, providing for the formation of a\r\ncompany to be styled the Eastern Chinese Railway Company, the ownership\r\nof which was to be vested solely in Russian and Chinese subjects and\r\nwhich was to construct and work a railway within the confines of China,\r\nfrom one of the points on the western borders of the province of\r\nHeh-Lung-Kiang to one of the points on the eastern borders of the\r\nprovince of Kirin; and to the connection of this railway with those\r\nbranches which the Imperial Russian Government would construct to the\r\nChinese frontier from Trans-Baikalia and the Southern Ussuri lines. The\r\ninstitution, which went by the plain, solid, commercial name of the\r\nRusso-Chinese Bank, was, of course, merely a sort of Far Eastern annex\r\nof the Finance Bureau of M. de Witte, and the line thus modestly\r\nannounced was the nucleus of the great railway which has since played\r\nsuch a large part in consolidating the Russian dominion over Manchuria.\r\nAt the outset it was pretended that the line was to be merely a short\r\ncut to Vladivostock, but the true ambitions at the bottom of the scheme\r\nbecame apparent when Russian engineers began to pour into the country\r\nfollowed by squadrons of Cossacks, nominally for the protection of the\r\nnew railway, but really in pursuance of Russia's invariable policy of\r\nimpressing the natives with a due sense of her enormous military\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mailed Fist]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the line, however, had not proceeded very far when,\r\nin 1897, an event occurred which gave the Czar's Government the chance\r\nfor which they had long been anxiously looking. The massacre of some\r\nGerman missionaries led to swift and stern reprisals on the part of the\r\nKaiser. The port of Kiao-Chau, in the province of Shantung, was seized\r\nuntil reparation was made for the outrage committed upon the majesty of\r\nthe German Empire, and to placate the offended \"mailed fist,\" the\r\nfeeble Government of China were compelled to hand over this important\r\nposition to Germany as a permanent possession, although, by a\r\ncharacteristic euphemism of diplomacy, the transaction was conveniently\r\nstyled a \"lease.\" Russia's opportunity was now too good to be\r\nneglected. Emboldened by the example of Germany, she demanded--for that\r\nis what her so-called \"request\" amounted to in reality--permission from\r\nthe Chinese Government to winter her fleet at Port Arthur. Perhaps it\r\nmay be imputed to her for righteousness that, unscrupulous as she is,\r\nshe has never found it necessary to employ the missionaries of Christ\r\nas instruments of aggression; at all events on this occasion she had no\r\nsuch excuse at hand. The helpless Chinese assented, of course, to her\r\nrequest; but now Great Britain, awake at last to the dangers which\r\nthreatened her Treaty rights, endeavored to intervene. Strong\r\nrepresentations were made by the English Minister to the\r\nTsung-lai-yamen as to the necessity for turning the port of\r\nTa-lien-wan--which lies immediately adjacent to Port Arthur--into a\r\nTreaty port; that is to say, throwing it open to the trade of the world\r\non the same terms as obtain at Shanghai, Canton, Hankau, and other\r\nports of China at which the policy of the Open Door prevails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JAPANESE AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Leases]\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen, however, were no match for the wily Russians, who\r\nhad the ear of the Chinese mandarins. The Government of the Czar\r\nsuccessfully opposed the suggestion, and backed up its representations\r\nat Peking by significant display of force, for a considerable fleet of\r\nmen-of-war arrived at Port Arthur and Ta-lien-wan in the spring of 1898\r\nand practically took possession. Then, by a mingled process of\r\nterrorism and corruption, the Chinese Government were induced to grant\r\nthe Czar a \"lease\" of the two harbors on the same terms as those on\r\nwhich Germany had been granted possession of Kiao-Chau, and, equally\r\nimportant, to permit the extension of the line of the Eastern Chinese\r\nRailway Company to Port Arthur. Thus came into being the Manchurian\r\nRailway, the construction of which was pushed on with feverish activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benevolent Professions]\r\n\r\nThe first step towards the complete acquisition and control of\r\nManchuria had now been successfully accomplished, and English diplomacy\r\nsought in vain to wrest from Russia the advantage she had thus\r\nskilfully acquired. Of course Russia was prolific of \"assurances\" as\r\nshe always has been in similar circumstances. The Government of the\r\nCzar solemnly declared, for the satisfaction of any confiding person\r\nwho was willing to believe it, that it had \"no intention of infringing\r\nthe rights and privileges guaranteed by existing treaties between China\r\nand foreign countries,\" and that the last thing it contemplated was\r\ninterference with Chinese sovereignty over the province of Manchuria.\r\nThe sincerity of these benevolent professions was to be judged by the\r\nfact that, having once secured a grip of Port Arthur, Russia hastened\r\nto convert it into a fortified post of great strength and magnitude,\r\nand closed it absolutely against the commerce of the world; and that,\r\nwhile on the one hand she so far met the anxious representations of the\r\nBritish Government as to constitute Ta-lien-wan a free port in name, on\r\nthe other hand she deprived the concession of all real meaning by an\r\nirritating system of passports and administrative restrictions upon\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wei-hai-Wei]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain attempted to neutralize the advantage her rival had\r\ngained in the Gulf of Pechili by securing a port on her own account,\r\nand, with the support of Japan, she induced the Chinese Government to\r\nenter into an agreement for the acquisition \"on lease\" of Wei-hai-Wei,\r\na harbor situated on the southern shore of the Gulf and opposite to\r\nPort Arthur. It was imagined at the time that the port could be turned\r\ninto a powerful naval base, but the naval and military surveys\r\nafterwards taken showed that it was of little use for strategic\r\npurposes, and it has consequently sunk into the position of a health\r\nstation for the English China Squadron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Niuchwang Railway]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Russia steadily increased her hold upon Manchuria, and\r\nlarge bodies of troops continued to be poured into the country. Her\r\nposition had now become so strong in the counsels of the Chinese Court\r\nthat in July, 1898, she openly opposed the concession, which British\r\ncapitalists were seeking, of an extension of the Northern Railways of\r\nChina to the Treaty Port of Niuchwang, which lies to the north of Port\r\nArthur, at the extremity of the Gulf. The importance of this extension\r\nto British and American commerce was immense. Niuchwang is the main\r\noutlet of the trade of Manchuria, and was at that time a busy thriving\r\ntown of about 60,000 inhabitants. Its value from the commercial point\r\nof view may be estimated from the fact that its total trade rose from\r\n£1,850,000 in 1881 to £7,253,650 in 1899, the year before it fell\r\nabsolutely into Russian hands. Russia's attempt to deprive her\r\ncommercial rivals of practical access by land to this valuable port\r\nwere, however, on this occasion only partially successful; the\r\nconstruction of the Shan-hai-Kwan-Niuchwang Railway was finally\r\npermitted; but the agreement was greatly modified to suit Russian views.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pavloff in Korea]\r\n\r\nConcurrently with these events, significant developments had been\r\ntaking place in Korea, which brought Japan once more upon the stage.\r\nFor some time after the Japanese had been driven from Port Arthur,\r\nRussia left Korea alone. She even entered into formal engagements with\r\nJapan, recognizing that Power's peculiar commercial rights and\r\ninterests in Korea. But now M. Pavloff arrived upon the scene at Seoul.\r\nIn March, 1900, he gave the Japanese the first taste of his quality by\r\nendeavoring to obtain a lease of the important strategic port of\r\nMasampo, situated in the southeast of Korea, facing the Japanese coast\r\nand dominating the straits between. At the same time he stipulated that\r\nthe Korean Government should not alienate to any other Power the island\r\nof Kojedo, which lies just opposite to Masampo. Japan successfully\r\nresisted this bold stroke of policy; and matters were in this position\r\nwhen the Boxer rising gave Russia a supreme opportunity. Her troops in\r\nManchuria were attacked by the rebels, and she at once hurried in\r\nreinforcements and seized the whole country. Resistance to her arms was\r\nput down with relentless vigor--with a vigor, indeed, far transcending\r\nthe necessities of the case, and the Blagovestchensk massacres, in\r\nwhich thousands of unarmed Chinamen were offered up as a sacrifice to\r\nthe offended majesty of Russia, will long be a stain upon the\r\nescutcheon of the Imperial Prophet of Peace. In the drastic process of\r\nabsorption which was now adopted, the treaty port of Niuchwang was\r\nnaturally included, and the interests of other Powers there became of\r\nvery small account indeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia and Manchuria]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Manchurian question had now assumed a more\r\nserious form. Of course the Czar's Government was profuse in its\r\nexplanations. No permanent territorial advantage was being sought, we\r\nwere told; as soon as lasting order had been established in Manchuria,\r\nand indispensable measures taken for the protection of the railway\r\nRussia would not fail to recall her troops from the province; above all\r\n\"the interests of foreign Powers and of international companies at the\r\nport of Niuchwang must remain inviolate.\" The restoration of lasting\r\norder, however, appeared to be a very tedious process. More and more\r\ntroops were drafted into the province and on the naval side also\r\npreparations were made for an imposing demonstration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russo-Chinese Treaty]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Alexeieff, commanding the Russian fleet, though not yet\r\nadvanced to the dignity of Viceroy of the East, now took charge of the\r\nCzar's interests, one of his first acts being to invite China to resume\r\nthe government of Manchuria \"under the protection of Russia.\" On\r\nNovember 11th, 1900, an agreement was signed at Port Arthur between the\r\nRussian and Chinese representatives. The terms of this remarkable\r\ndocument, which were promptly disclosed by the able and well-informed\r\ncorrespondent of the London _Times_ at Peking, were a startling\r\nrevelation. They provided virtually for a Russian military protectorate\r\nover Manchuria. Mukden, the ancient capital of Manchuria and the\r\nburial-place of the Manchu dynasty, was to be the centre of control,\r\nand a Russian political resident was to be stationed there. This city,\r\nwhich now possesses a population of about 250,000, has in modern times\r\nbecome a great place of trade. It is situated 110 miles to the\r\nnortheast of Niuchwang, and its position in the centre of the\r\nManchurian railway system renders it a place of much strategical\r\nimportance. Not only were these vast concessions made to Russia, but\r\nthe Treaty rights of other Powers at Niuchwang itself were disregarded.\r\nGreat Britain and the United States necessarily entered an urgent\r\nprotest against this singular method of preserving their interests\r\ninviolate. But Count Lamsdorff, the Russian Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, declared to our Ambassador that the Russo-Chinese Agreement\r\nwas merely a temporary arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe value of the solemn assurance of the Foreign Minister was exposed\r\nto the world almost immediately afterwards by the invaluable\r\ncorrespondent of the London _Times_, who sent to his paper the terms of\r\na new and more far-reaching Agreement which the Russian diplomatists\r\nwere trying to force upon the Chinese Court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anglo-Japanese Alliance]\r\n\r\nThe position of affairs was now profoundly altered by the conclusion of\r\nthe Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This important Treaty gave Japan the\r\nstrength and the encouragement ultimately to intervene on her own\r\naccount and endeavor to curb the restless ambitions of Russia. Russia\r\ngave a definite pledge that her troops would be withdrawn from\r\nManchuria by instalments on the expiration of a certain period. That\r\nperiod expired on October 8th, 1903, but the pledge was never redeemed.\r\nA show of evacuation was made in 1902, but the troops returned, and at\r\nthe end of October of 1903 Mukden was re-occupied in force. Never\r\nduring the whole period did Russia lose her grip upon Niuchwang.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians in Korea]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Alliance\r\nin the beginning of 1902, Japan waited for eighteen months before\r\nentering into the diplomatic lists alone against Russia. But at last,\r\nin August of 1903, this course was rendered imperative upon her, not\r\nonly by the failure of the Czar's Government to carry out their\r\nengagements in regard to Manchuria, but by their aggressive policy in\r\nKorea. M. Pavloff, rebuffed at Masampo in 1900, had turned his energies\r\nin another direction. He secured for his countrymen valuable mining\r\nrights in Northern Korea, and Russians then began to cross the Yalu\r\nRiver and ultimately occupied Yongampo, a town of some importance on\r\nthe southern bank. Not content with railway enterprises, they even\r\nstarted to construct fortifications. The Japanese, of course,\r\ninterposed energetically and succeeded in modifying the Russian\r\nactivity; but it now became apparent that, unless some binding\r\narrangement could be arrived at, Korea was destined to share the fate\r\nof Manchuria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Protests]\r\n\r\nRepresentations were therefore made at St. Petersburg calling for a\r\nrevision of the Treaties of 1896 and 1898, and a friendly settlement of\r\nthe respective rights of the two Powers. The story of the negotiations\r\nwhich ensued is a simple one. It is a story of courteous and moderate\r\nrepresentation on the one side, and of studied delay and contemptuous\r\nrefusals on the other. The negotiations on behalf of Russia were in the\r\nhands of Admiral Alexeieff, now elevated to the position of Viceroy of\r\nthe East, and it is said to be mainly due to his influence that his\r\nGovernment adopted such an unbending attitude. Japan asked for a\r\nrepetition by Russia of the pledges she had given that she would\r\nrecognize the integrity and independence of China and Korea; and,\r\nfurther, that she should recognize the preponderance of Japanese\r\npolitical and commercial interests in Korea. Russia haughtily refused\r\nto give Japan any pledge as to the integrity of China, and contended\r\nthat her position in Manchuria was regulated by treaties with China in\r\nwhich Japan had no right to interfere. As to Korea, she proposed the\r\nestablishment of a neutral zone in the north of the province, leaving\r\nthe south of the country to become a sphere of commercial influence for\r\nJapan, but she expressly stipulated that the latter Power should make\r\nno use of any portion of Korean territory for strategic purposes. The\r\nproposal was so absurdly one-sided that Japan returned to the charge\r\nwith the suggestion that a neutral zone should be established both on\r\nthe Manchurian and the Korean sides of the frontier. She also\r\nreiterated her request for an agreement as to the maintenance of the\r\nterritorial integrity of Manchuria and China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia's Discourtesy]\r\n\r\nRussia contemptuously delayed reply to these representations in spite\r\nof the courteous requests of the Japanese Government. In the meanwhile\r\nshe kept augmenting her forces in the Far East till the situation\r\nbecame impossible of continuance.\r\n\r\nEvery day that passed threatened to transfer the balance of naval power\r\nin favor of the European Power, for a powerful fleet was being hurried\r\nout to the Far East, and the badly-finished warships in Port Arthur\r\nwere being patched up by an army of mechanicians. Mr. Kurino, who\r\nconducted the negotiations at St. Petersburg, pressed for an answer,\r\nbut was put off with promises no less than six times. Such discourtesy\r\ncould only have one result. The dignity of Japan could brook no further\r\ninsolence, and the Czar and his Ministers were politely informed that\r\nunder such circumstances negotiations were useless. It was in vain that\r\nhurried telegrams were dispatched to Admiral Alexeieff to present a\r\nreply to the justly incensed Cabinet at Tokio. The die had been cast,\r\nand the big bully of the North, who had for so long baited the plucky\r\nlittle Japanese, realized at last that threats and bluff no longer were\r\nof any avail, and that the matter was now referred to the God of\r\nBattles.\r\n\r\nOn February 7th, 1904, Japan formally broke off the negotiations and\r\nwithdrew her Minister from St. Petersburg. The war cloud had burst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF THE YALU--SINKING OF THE CHIH-YUEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  Russia Bluffing--Japan's Navy--\"Nisshin\" and \"Kasaga\"--New and\r\n    Efficient--Japan's Dockyards--Opposing Figures--Russian\r\n    Navy--Belated Help--Japan's Superiority--Russian\r\n    Harbor--Japan on Land--Russia's Army--East of Baikal--Weak\r\n    Communications--Port Arthur--Korea as Base--Command of the\r\n    Sea--The First Blow--World-Wide Interest--A Graphic\r\n    Account--Russian Losses--The Fight of February 9th--Russian\r\n    Bravery--Japanese Modesty--Damage Understated--Only One\r\n    Repairing Dock--Alexeieff's Reason for Casualties--The Fight\r\n    at Chemulpo--The First Shot--Japanese Disembarkation--A Brave\r\n    Russian Captain--A Target for Japanese Gunners--The Plucky\r\n    \"Korietz\"--Wounding and Burning--Japan's Handicap.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia Bluffing]\r\n\r\nThe growing menace of the situation in the Far East had been for months\r\nattracting the anxious attention of the whole world, and at the\r\nbeginning of 1904 it became evident that war was inevitable, unless one\r\nor other of the disputants was prepared to make a complete surrender of\r\nits essential claims. The unlikelihood of this remote possibility being\r\nfulfilled was confirmed by the steady and, on the Russian side at\r\nleast, the feverish preparations for hostilities which were carried on\r\nas an accompaniment to the repeated protestations of pacific intentions\r\nby the Czar's Government and its diplomatic agents abroad. Those who\r\nstill believed in peace were sustained by the conviction that one of\r\nthe parties to the dispute was bluffing. Sympathizers with Russia\r\npointed to the tremendous power and inexhaustible resources of the\r\nNorthern Empire, and asked whether it were possible that a young and\r\nsmall country like Japan should dare to try conclusions with so\r\ngigantic an antagonist. On the other hand, the friends of Japan\r\nemphasized the weakness of the Russian position in the Far East and the\r\nwell-known financial embarrassments beneath which her Exchequer was\r\nlaboring. It is, therefore, apropos to survey at this point the\r\nmilitary and strategic position in the Far East which revealed itself\r\nimmediately before the final rupture of diplomatic negotiations and the\r\nbeginning of active hostilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Navy]\r\n\r\nIn any conflict between Russia and Japan it was obvious that the first\r\nstruggle must be for the mastery of the sea, and it is, therefore,\r\ninteresting to consider primarily the relative naval strength of the\r\ntwo Powers in Far Eastern waters. The navy of Japan has been built, not\r\nonly on English models, but for the most part in English yards; and\r\nsince the Chino-Japanese War it has been increased by a number of\r\nvessels of the latest and most powerful type. The result is that the\r\nmost formidable feature of Japan's naval strength is its complete\r\nhomogeneity. The tabular statement on page 41, gives the names and\r\nprincipal characteristics of what may be called Japan's first fighting\r\nline at sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Nisshin\" and \"Kasaga\"]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1903 the Japanese Government, with great\r\nenterprise, managed to secure a powerful accession to this fleet by\r\npurchasing from Argentina two freshly constructed cruisers of the most\r\nmodern and efficient type. These two vessels, which have been\r\nre-christened the _Nisshin_ and _Kasaga_, were hastily equipped for sea\r\nat Genoa, and, commanded for the time being by retired English officers\r\nand manned by English crews, started in January for the long voyage to\r\nthe Far East. Although war had not yet been declared, it was clearly\r\nimminent, and the Russian squadron in the Mediterranean received orders\r\nto watch the new cruisers closely, with the object, of course, of\r\ncapturing them in case hostilities broke out before the vessels had\r\nreached Japan. The taste of their quality, however, which the _Nisshin_\r\nand _Kasaga_ were able to give to the Russians proved how valuable an\r\naddition they were to the Japanese navy, for they easily outdistanced\r\ntheir slow-footed pursuers, and what promised at one time to be an\r\nexciting race degenerated practically into a walk over. The new\r\ncruisers arrived safely at Yokohama on February 16th, and were at once\r\nsent into dock to refit and prepare for active service. These splendid\r\nfighting machines must, therefore, be added to the list.\r\n\r\n                        JAPAN'S UP-TO-DATE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                              BATTLESHIPS.\r\n\r\n                                       Nominal    Gun       Weight of\r\n     Name          Displacement I.H.P.

The first four battleships in the list were completed less\r\nthan two years before the war, while the armored cruisers were built\r\nbetween 1899 and 1901. The protected cruisers include several of the\r\nvessels that defeated the Chinese fleet at the battle of the Yalu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Dockyards]\r\n\r\nFor the accommodation of her fleet Japan possesses four well-equipped\r\ndockyards, capable not only of repairing damaged vessels of any class,\r\nbut of constructing new ones; and this is, perhaps, the greatest\r\nadvantage which the island kingdom has over Russia in the present\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposing Figures]\r\n\r\nThe naval strength of Russia in the Far East at the outbreak of\r\nhostilities is shown in the tabular statement appearing on page 44,\r\nwhich, again, does not include vessels of the smallest class nor the\r\ntorpedo-boat flotilla.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Navy]\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that the Russian battleships offered a great\r\nvariety in design and fighting power--a serious disadvantage, for in\r\nmanoeuvring the efficiency of the whole squadron sinks to the level\r\nof that of the least effective vessel it contains. The _Czarevitch_ and\r\nthe _Retvisan_, which were the latest vessels to arrive at Port Arthur,\r\nwere also the most powerful members of the fleet. The former vessel was\r\nbuilt in France after the latest French model, and the latter in\r\nPhiladelphia. This fleet was divided, at the outbreak of war, between\r\nPort Arthur and Vladivostock, the four powerful cruisers, _Gromoboi_,\r\n_Bogatyr_, _Rossia_, and _Rurik_ being stationed at the latter port.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belated Help]\r\n\r\nWhile negotiations were still proceeding, though at a critical point,\r\nRussia prepared to send out very formidable reinforcements to the Far\r\nEast from her Mediterranean Fleet. These reinforcements included the\r\n_Osliabia_, a battleship of over 12,000 tons displacement, with a speed\r\nof 19 knots; the _Dmitri Donskoi_, an armored cruiser of 6,000 tons\r\ndisplacement and a speed of 15 knots; the _Aurora_, a swift protected\r\ncruiser of the largest class; several cruisers of the volunteer fleet,\r\nwith troops, naval drafts, and supplies; and a number of torpedo craft.\r\nThis squadron had begun to assemble at Port Said before the outbreak of\r\nwar, and the vessels at once began to pass through the Canal. But\r\nbefore they were ready to sail for the China seas, war broke out, and\r\nthe departure was delayed. The initial Russian reverses at sea made it\r\npractically impossible for this reinforcing fleet to proceed to the\r\nseat of war, as it would have been liable to interception by the\r\nJapanese fleet in overwhelming strength. Accordingly, after cruising\r\naimlessly about in the Red Sea for some weeks, the ships were ordered\r\nto return to the Baltic; and in the beginning of March they passed\r\nthrough the Suez Canal again on their way north.\r\n\r\n                        RUSSIA'S AVAILABLE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                              BATTLESHIPS.\r\n\r\n                                       Nominal    Gun       Weight of\r\n     Name          Displacement I.H.P.

Although Port Arthur had been rendered\r\nalmost impregnable as a fortress, the Russians had not had time to\r\ncomplete it as a naval dockyard, and at the outbreak of war it\r\npossessed only one dry dock, and that not capable of accommodating\r\nvessels of the largest size. At Vladivostock the channel out of the\r\nharbor could only be kept free by ice-breakers. In the event of naval\r\ndisasters, Russia, therefore, had no possibility of repairing her lame\r\nducks, while the radius of her fleet's activity was limited by the fact\r\nthat her only supplies of coal were to be obtained at Port Arthur. In\r\nthe situation, therefore, which presented itself at the outbreak of\r\nwar, this powerful naval force was practically deprived of mobility. It\r\ncould not leave Port Arthur for more than a short cruise; and while it\r\nremained there it must be specially vulnerable to attack, lying in an\r\nopen roadstead and huddled together in order to enjoy the protection of\r\nthe guns of the fortress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan on Land]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the land forces of the two belligerent Powers, it was\r\nonly possible to reckon with certainty those of Japan; for it remained\r\ndoubtful, until the progress of active operations revealed the facts,\r\nhow much of Russia's enormous military strength had been concentrated\r\nin the Far East. Broadly speaking, Japan could put into the field in\r\nthe last resort an army of between 400,000 and 450,000 men. The\r\nstanding army amounts to almost 200,000 men, and it was immediately\r\navailable for mobilization. To this number another 35,000 men was added\r\nby the reserve, while the militia of all arms could be reckoned at\r\n200,000 men. The Japanese infantry soldier is armed with the Midji\r\nmagazine rifle, and the artillery with the Arisaka quick-firing gun;\r\nbut the adoption of this latter weapon has been so recent that the\r\nwhole of the artillery is not yet supplied with it, and in this one\r\nrespect at least the Russian gunners are believed to possess a very\r\ngreat advantage. The Japanese army has been organized largely on German\r\nmodels. It proved its efficiency as a fighting machine in the\r\nChino-Japanese War; while the Japanese troops that took part in the\r\nrelief of the Peking Legations earned the unstinted praise of all the\r\nmilitary experts who watched their behavior. Until the present war,\r\nhowever, the Japanese army had never undergone the supreme ordeal of\r\nfacing a European adversary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia's Army]\r\n\r\nOf the Russian military organization, the strength and weakness have\r\nlong been known to the world, and the great question for strategists in\r\ncontemplating the present hostilities was the number of troops which\r\nthe Northern Power could bring into the field to confront her foe.\r\nVarious estimates had been given, from the overwhelming army of 400,000\r\nmen confidently claimed by Russia's partisans, to a force of little\r\nmore than a quarter of that strength. But though the actual figures\r\nwere in doubt, it was possible by collating the information from\r\nvarious sources to arrive at an approximate estimate of the truth. At\r\nthe time of the Boxer outbreak in 1900 Russia had 35,000 men in the Far\r\nEast, and that force was, within little more than a year, trebled.\r\nSince the possibility of trouble with Japan had loomed on the horizon,\r\nreinforcements had been steadily dribbling over the Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway and over seas in the volunteer transports, until the army under\r\nthe command of the Viceroy of the Far East could not number much less\r\nthan 150,000 men of all arms, with 286 guns. Of this force, at least a\r\nhalf must have been absorbed in the defence of the long line of railway\r\ncommunications and in garrisoning fortresses; but the troops available\r\nfor active operations consisted largely of Russia's most formidable\r\nfighting material--namely, the Cossacks, who possess an endurance and\r\nmobility which must be of the utmost value in such a country as that in\r\nwhich the present war was to be fought out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n         ADMIRAL TOGO.

According to this\r\nauthority, Russia had available at that time a total of 3,115 officers,\r\n147,479 men, and 266 guns; and these numbers included the railway\r\nguards over the whole of the Manchurian railways and the garrisons of\r\nthe principal fortresses. The infantry of this force numbered 108,000\r\nofficers and men, and the cavalry 22,000 officers and men, of whom\r\nnearly the whole were Cossacks. The garrisons of Port Arthur and\r\nVladivostock alone absorbed 45,000 men, and remembering that the\r\nrailway line to be guarded, east of Lake Baikal, was over 1,500 miles\r\nin length, and traverses a country of which the inhabitants were more\r\nor less hostile, it is evident that the troops available to take the\r\nfield at the end of January could not have exceeded, on this estimate,\r\nmore than 50,000 men. Lake Baikal is 400 miles in length, and though a\r\nrailway round its southern extremity was in course of construction, it\r\nwas far from completion at the outbreak of hostilities. The lake is\r\nfrozen over during the winter months, when transit has to be effected\r\nby sledges. But in the emergency the Russians laid railway lines across\r\nthe lake, and thus by the end of February had established a through\r\nservice of sorts. But even then the number of reinforcements and the\r\nquantity of supplies that could be moved up to the theatre of war were\r\nstrictly limited by the delays inseparable from the working of a single\r\ntrack railway, and it is doubtful whether more than 25,000 men at the\r\noutside had been added to the field force by the beginning of March.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weak Communications]\r\n\r\nThe strategical problem which presented itself at the outbreak of\r\nhostilities was a comparatively simple one--for Japan at any rate. The\r\npower of Russia in the Far East depended on the maintenance of two\r\ngreat arteries of communication with the heart of the Russian Empire.\r\nOne of these was the over-sea passage from the Black Sea or the Baltic\r\nthrough the Suez Canal and the East Indian Archipelago--a voyage\r\noccupying six weeks at least, and however feasible in time of peace,\r\nrendered particularly difficult and even precarious under war\r\nconditions owing to the possibility of interception and the absence of\r\nany intermediate coaling stations. The other connecting link between\r\nPort Arthur and St. Petersburg was the Trans-Siberian Railway, that\r\ngigantic enterprise which, completed in 1899, brought the capital of\r\nRussia within 15 days' journey of its furthermost outpost in the Yellow\r\nSea. From Moscow to Port Arthur is a distance of some 4,000 miles, but\r\nat two-thirds of its length the railway is interrupted by the great\r\ninland sea known as Lake Baikal. At this point transshipment across the\r\nlake had to take place, a circumstance that offered an insurmountable\r\nhindrance to rapid transit. In the building of the railway, too,\r\nsoundness had been sacrificed to rapidity of construction; the line was\r\nonly a single track one, with stations and sidings at intervals of\r\nabout 25 miles; and even when the whole service was monopolized for\r\nmilitary purposes the number of trains that could be passed over the\r\nrailway in one day was a fixed and very limited quantity. Even with\r\nthis line open, therefore, the rate at which Russia could reinforce her\r\ntroops in the Far East had to be determined by other circumstances than\r\nmilitary urgency, and the number of her reinforcements also had to be\r\ngoverned by the capacity of the line to bring up not only men, but\r\nsupplies; for Manchuria itself does not provide the means of support\r\nfor a large army. The experience of the American Army in Cuba and of\r\nthe British Army in South Africa proved what tremendous difficulties\r\nmay be encountered in carrying supplies to a large force at a distance\r\nmuch less remote from its base than Russia's was. For years past Russia\r\nhas sent out her troops and supplies to the Far East mainly by sea. For\r\ntwelve months before the war broke out a constant stream of transports,\r\ncolliers and supply ships had passed from the Black Sea to the Gulf of\r\nPechili, and this stream was only interrupted on the outbreak of war--a\r\nsignificant admission of the incompleteness of the Russian\r\npreparations, as well as of the inadequacy of the Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway to supply her needs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nIt was evident, therefore, that Japan's first object was to shut off\r\nPort Arthur from the sea, and her next to cut the railway communication\r\nto the North. This done, the Russian fortress, however impregnable to\r\nassault, must ultimately fall to investment. From Port Arthur, which,\r\nas a glance at the map will show, lies at the very tip of Liao-tung\r\nPeninsula, the railway runs due north for six hundred miles through\r\nNiuchwang and Mukden to Harbin, where it joins the branch line to\r\nVladivostock. Though Russia has for several years been in occupation of\r\nthis territory, her hold upon it is by no means secure. The population\r\nis distinctly unfriendly, and for the mere defence of the line\r\nthousands of troops are necessary. Indeed, it was this necessity that\r\nRussia urged as an excuse for her military occupation of Manchuria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Korea as Base]\r\n\r\nWithin the triangle of which Harbin is the apex, of which the lines to\r\nPort Arthur and Vladivostock are sides, and of which the course of the\r\nYalu River is the base, the sphere of immediate military operations\r\npractically had to be confined, as the ice-bound condition of the coast\r\nto the west of Port Arthur made a landing in force there impossible\r\ntill the spring. The necessity of maintaining communications tied the\r\nRussian forces very largely to the railway lines. But for either\r\nbelligerent the helpless kingdom of Korea, which lies south of a line\r\ndrawn between Port Arthur and Vladivostock, for aggressive operations,\r\nafforded the most convenient line of advance. Through Korea Russia\r\ncould menace Japan, and through Korea Japan could most easily march\r\nagainst Port Arthur. Naturally, therefore, Russia's first care was to\r\nmass her available troops on the line of the Yalu, and concentrate\r\nreinforcements at Harbin ready to be moved to whatever point might\r\nprove the objective of the Japanese attack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Command of the Sea]\r\n\r\nBut the command of the sea was the essential condition to attack by\r\nland by either combatant. With the Russian fleet masked or destroyed,\r\nJapan could choose as a landing-place for her armies any of the\r\nnumerous ports on the western coast of Korea, and so approach in force\r\nthe Yalu River, which divides Korea from Manchuria and the Liao-tung\r\nPeninsula. With imperfect command of the sea, Japan would have a second\r\nresource. She could land her troops at Masampo, separated only by a\r\nhundred miles of sea from her own ports, or she could, at a push, land\r\nher forces on the east coast of Korea, at Yuen San or Gensan. But the\r\nformer plan of operations would have entailed a long overland march\r\nbefore the objective was reached, and the latter the maintenance of\r\ncommunications over difficult and mountainous country. Evidently, then,\r\nimmeasurable importance attached to the result of the first naval\r\nengagements, and to their influence in giving the command of the sea to\r\nthe one or the other of the two belligerent Powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Blow]\r\n\r\nOn February 5th M. Kurino, the Japanese Minister at the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg, announced to the Government of the Czar that Japan could\r\nwait no longer for the long-delayed Russian reply, and that further\r\nnegotiations were broken off. This startling news reached Europe and\r\nAmerica on the evening of Sunday, February 7th; and while its\r\nsignificance was still being anxiously discussed in every capital, and\r\nwhile statesmen and jurists were still trying to convince one another\r\nthat the rupture of diplomatic negotiations did not necessarily imply\r\nthe beginning of war, there burst like a thunder-clap the further news\r\nthat the first grim and irretrievable blow had been struck. Having\r\ndecided that the arbitrament of war was inevitable, Japan acted on her\r\ndecision with swift and terrible effect. On the night of Monday,\r\nFebruary 8th, a daring attack by torpedo-boats was made on the Russian\r\nfleet lying at anchor in the Port Arthur roadstead, and at one fell\r\nswoop the boasted might of Russia at sea was hopelessly broken. This\r\nastounding intelligence was first conveyed to the world in an official\r\ntelegram from Admiral Alexeieff to the Czar, couched in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n\"I most devotedly inform your Majesty that about midnight between the\r\n26th and 27th of January (February 8th and 9th) Japanese torpedo-boats\r\ndelivered a sudden mine attack on the squadron lying in the Chinese\r\nroads at Port Arthur, the battleships _Retvisan_ and _Czarevitch_ and\r\nthe cruiser _Pallada_ being holed. The degree of seriousness of the\r\nholes has to be ascertained. Particulars will be forwarded to your\r\nImperial Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: World-wide Interest]\r\n\r\nThe stunning effect of this news was only enhanced when fuller details\r\nof the incident so baldly and laconically announced came to hand. No\r\nnews of the movements of the Japanese fleet had been allowed to leak\r\nout, and its presence before Port Arthur was wholly unexpected by\r\nothers as well as the Russians. On the 3rd of February the Russian\r\nfleet had put to sea, and for twenty-four hours the world was agog with\r\nthe news of so momentous a movement. But the speculation died suddenly\r\nwhen it appeared that the fleet had returned immediately to its\r\nanchorage. The Japanese, with characteristic alertness, realized the\r\nsplendid opportunity which the necessarily exposed position of the\r\nRussian ships afforded to an enterprising enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Graphic Account]\r\n\r\nWhile everything was still tranquil at Port Arthur, and the Russian\r\nauthorities were confidently announcing that the foe could not be\r\nexpected for three or four days, the blow fell. According to the\r\ngraphic account of an eye-witness, every one at Port Arthur had settled\r\ndown for the night, when suddenly across the bay reverberated the shock\r\nof three violent and successive explosions. In a moment all was bustle\r\nand confusion on the Russian warships. Searchlights flashed\r\nbewilderingly and without purpose across the waters, and quick-firing\r\nguns from vessel after vessel began a panic fusillade, which Admiral\r\nAlexeieff, in his official report, euphemistically described as \"a well\r\nconcentrated fire at the right time.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Losses]\r\n\r\nIt was midnight, and in the darkness and confusion it was impossible\r\nfor any one to know exactly what was happening; but when the morning\r\nlight broke over Port Arthur the two proudest possessions of the\r\nRussian fleet, the powerful battleships _Retvisan_ and _Czarevitch_,\r\nwere seen passing slowly towards the harbor entrance, across which they\r\npresently lay in evidently a badly damaged condition. The cruiser\r\n_Pallada_ followed, listing heavily to port, and she also was grounded\r\noutside the entrance to the harbor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fight of Feb. 9th]\r\n\r\nIt was at ten o'clock the next day, the 9th of February, that the\r\nRussians obtained their first glimpse of the enemy. In the distance\r\nthree Japanese cruisers were described hanging observant upon the\r\nRussian fleet, and immediately what remained of that once powerful\r\nsquadron put to sea in pursuit of the audacious enemy. But, as before,\r\nthis bold movement had no result, and the Russian ships returned to\r\nanchor. Scarcely had they done so when the Japanese squadron of sixteen\r\nvessels, including six battleships and four first-class cruisers,\r\nsteamed into view in fighting formation. As the leading vessels at a\r\ndistance of some three miles came into line with the harbor entrance\r\nthe flash of their great guns broke through the mist, and for nearly an\r\nhour the Japanese shells continued to burst over the forts, along the\r\nbeach and among the Russian ships, who replied vigorously, and whose\r\nfire was assisted by that of the powerful land batteries. Again the\r\nRussian squadron steamed out to meet the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Bravery]\r\n\r\nSome of the cruisers advanced towards the Japanese fleet with great\r\ngallantry, the _Novik_, the _Diana_, and the _Askold_ particularly\r\ndistinguishing themselves, with the result that they were all rather\r\nseriously hit by the Japanese fire and were compelled to retire upon\r\nthe main squadron. Several other of the Russian ships were damaged\r\nbefore the Japanese fleet drew off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Modesty]\r\n\r\nThe official dispatch of Admiral Togo to his Government upon the\r\nmomentous achievements of his fleet during these two days was a model\r\nof modesty and self-restraint. Dated \"February 10th, at Sea,\" it ran:--\r\n\r\n\"After the combined fleet left Sasebo, on the 6th, everything went off\r\nas planned. At midnight on the 8th the advance squadron attacked the\r\nenemy's advance squadron, the latter being mostly outside the bay. The\r\n_Poltava_, _Askold_ and others were apparently struck by torpedoes.\r\n\r\n\"At noon on the 9th the fleet advanced to the offing of Port Arthur Bay\r\nand attacked the enemy for forty minutes, I believe doing considerable\r\ndamage. I believe the enemy were greatly demoralized. They stopped\r\nfighting at one o'clock, and appeared to retreat to the harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n               GENERAL KUROKI.

Our casualties were 4 killed and 54 wounded.\r\nThe Imperial Princes on board suffered no harm.\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of the officers was cool, and not unlike their conduct at\r\nmanoeuvres.\r\n\r\n\"This morning, owing to heavy south wind, detailed reports from the\r\nvessels have not been received, so I merely report the above fact.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Damage Understated]\r\n\r\nThis dispatch, as we know both from the Russian official accounts and\r\nfrom independent witnesses, really understated the extent of the blow\r\nwhich the Japanese Admiral had dealt to the Russian fleet; the vessels\r\ntorpedoed were not cruisers only, but the two crack battleships upon\r\nwhich Admiral Alexeieff necessarily placed peculiar dependence, and the\r\n\"considerable damage\" which Admiral Togo believed had been done by the\r\nsubsequent bombardment had put out of action, for the time being, the\r\nbattleship _Poltava_ and the cruisers _Diana_, _Askold_ and _Novik_. Of\r\nthese the _Poltava_ and the _Novik_ were badly hit on the water\r\nline--damage the seriousness of which needs no comment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only One Repairing Dock]\r\n\r\nThe most significant confession, indeed, of the crushing character of\r\nthe blow which at the very commencement of the war the Japanese had\r\nsucceeded in dealing to their powerful adversary was contained in a\r\nsubsequent dispatch from the Viceroy to the Czar. Telegraphing on\r\nFebruary 11th, Admiral Alexeieff reported \"the _Czarevitch_ and the\r\n_Pallada_ were brought on the 9th inst. into the inner harbor. The leak\r\nin the _Retvisan_ is being temporarily stopped. _The repairing of an\r\nironclad is a complicated business, the period for the completion of\r\nwhich it is hard to indicate._\" This guarded language must be read in\r\nthe light of the fact that the Russians had only one repairing dock\r\ncapable of holding a large ship at Port Arthur, and the terrible\r\ncharacter of the disaster which within forty-eight hours had befallen\r\nthe naval power of the haughty Muscovite in the Far East will be\r\nrealized. The losses in men were not very serious, amounting in all to\r\n10 men killed and 2 officers and 41 men wounded, but the injury to the\r\nfleet was practically irreparable. Seven out of Russia's best vessels\r\nhad been placed _hors de combat_, her battleships' strength being\r\nreduced to 4, namely, the _Petropavlovsk_, _Peresviet_, _Pobieda_ and\r\n_Sevastopol_ (the last two being themselves under repair when the war\r\nbroke out), and her already small cruiser force being reduced to two,\r\nnamely, the _Bayan_ and the _Boyarin_. The following is the list of the\r\ndamaged ships:--\r\n\r\n           _Czarevitch_, battleship, torpedoed.\r\n           _Retvisan_, battleship, torpedoed.\r\n           _Poltava_, battleship, shelled on the water-line.\r\n           _Novik_, cruiser, shelled on the water-line.\r\n           _Askold_, cruiser, shelled on the water-line.\r\n           _Diana_, cruiser, shelled on the water-line.\r\n           _Pallada_, cruiser, torpedoed.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the repairs to the _Askold_ were quickly\r\nexecuted, and that she was able to take part in the subsequent\r\noperations a few days later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexeieff's Reason for Casualties]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Alexeieff's dispatch to the Czar stated that the majority of\r\nthe wounded belonged to the _Pallada_. The reason for this was that\r\nthey were \"poisoned by gases produced by the explosion of the torpedo\r\ncharged with melinite.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese fleet, naturally, did not emerge from such an action\r\nunscathed. Its losses in men were officially reported as 4 killed and\r\n54 wounded; and although the fighting efficiency of the fleet was not\r\nseriously impaired, two armored cruisers, the _Iwote_ and the _Yakumo_,\r\nwere injured, and, as the casualties show, several other vessels were\r\nstruck. But the most remarkable circumstance was that the torpedo-boats\r\nby which the night attack had been delivered escaped scot-free.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fight at Chemulpo]\r\n\r\nWhile the Russian capital was still reeling under the shock of this\r\nunexpected disaster, there came the news of a fresh blow struck by the\r\nJapanese arms in another quarter of the theatre of war. This was the\r\nnaval engagement at Chemulpo--a port on the northwest coast of\r\nKorea--in which two of the Czar's warships and one transport steamer\r\nwere destroyed. It is true that only one of these vessels had any\r\nfighting capacity, and that the conflict in itself was of much less\r\nconsequence than the battle at Port Arthur, but the incident gave a\r\nfurther and mortifying revelation of the disorganization of the naval\r\nforces of Russia in the Far East, and of the total absence of anything\r\nlike a bold and definite plan of operations from the minds of her\r\ncommanders. In spite of the critical position in which the negotiations\r\nbetween the two Powers had been standing for weeks, the Russian fleet\r\nin the Yellow Sea was unconcentrated and generally unprepared for war.\r\nThe outbreak of hostilities found two vessels, the _Varyag_, a\r\nprotected cruiser of 6,500 tons, and the _Korietz_, a gunboat, old,\r\nindeed, but not without some use for coast defence, quietly stationed\r\nat Chemulpo, a ready prey for a Japanese squadron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Shot]\r\n\r\nOn the 8th instant a Russian steamer called the _Sungari_, which was\r\nemployed for the transport of stores, entered the harbor with the news\r\nthat a large fleet, which her captain believed to be Japanese, was fast\r\napproaching. The _Korietz_ was sent out to reconnoitre. The columns of\r\nsmoke on the horizon did indeed come from the funnels of the enemy's\r\nships. The advancing squadron consisted of a first-class battleship\r\nflying the flag of Admiral Uriu, and the cruisers _Akashi_,\r\n_Takachiho_, _Naniwa_ and _Chiyoda_, as well as seven torpedo-boats,\r\nthe whole convoying transports with 2,500 Japanese troops on board. The\r\n_Korietz_ cleared her decks for action and fired--one account says that\r\nthe shot was accidental--upon the rapidly approaching foe. The latter\r\nreplied by discharging two torpedoes at the daring gunboat, which then\r\nretreated back into harbor. It is interesting to note that, whether the\r\ngunner of the _Korietz_ acted under orders or not, he fired the first\r\nshot in the war, for the incident occurred several hours before the\r\ntorpedo attack upon Port Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Disembarkation]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese took no further notice of the Russian ships until the\r\ndisembarkation of their troops had been carried out, a process which\r\nwas commenced immediately and was carried out through the night with\r\ngreat celerity and in the most perfect order. In this matter, indeed,\r\nas in all the preliminary stages of the war, the operations of the\r\nMikado's forces showed how carefully thought out were the plans of his\r\nnaval and military advisers. Not a detail appeared to have been\r\nomitted, every eventuality had been skilfully calculated beforehand,\r\nand as a result the whole machinery of warfare moved like clockwork.\r\n\r\nBy four o'clock on the morning of the 9th the process of disembarkation\r\nhad been successfully completed, and the soldiers had all found their\r\npre-arranged billets on shore. The Japanese squadron then put out to\r\nsea once more, and waited for daylight before taking any action. At\r\nseven o'clock, however, the captain of the _Varyag_ was served with an\r\nultimatum from Admiral Uriu declaring that hostilities had broken out\r\nbetween Russia and Japan, and summoning him to leave the harbor by\r\nmidday. Should he refuse to do so, then the Japanese fleet would be\r\ncompelled to attack the _Varyag_ and the _Korietz_ within the harbor. A\r\ncorrespondent of a London paper who was present on the spot states that\r\nthe commanders of the other warships stationed at Chemulpo--namely, the\r\nBritish cruiser _Talbot_, the Italian _Elba_ and the French _Pascal_,\r\nheld a meeting and drew up a strong protest addressed to the Japanese\r\nAdmiral against his proposal to attack the Russian vessels in a neutral\r\nport. The message was sent out in the _Talbot's_ launch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Brave Russian Captain]\r\n\r\nThe protest, however, was not needed, for the captain of the _Varyag_,\r\nin spite of the overwhelming disparity of forces, determined to face\r\nhis enemies in the open. It was an act of conspicuous gallantry, only\r\nto be expected, it must be said, from the representative of a country\r\nwhose sons, whatever their faults, have never been slow to die for her\r\nsake. The manner, too, in which the _Varyag_ set about her voyage to\r\ninevitable destruction was well worthy of the finest naval traditions\r\nof all countries and all ages. We are told that as the drums beat to\r\nquarters, and as the doomed ship steamed out amid the cheers of the\r\nforeign crews in the port, the band was massed upon her deck and burst\r\ninto the strains of the Russian Hymn, the National Anthem. It was like\r\nthat \"flourish of insulting trumpets\" with which Raleigh faced the guns\r\nof Cadiz, and the bravado of which Stevenson said he liked \"better than\r\nthe wisest dispositions to ensure victory; it comes from the heart and\r\ngoes to it.\" No one, indeed, who is capable of generous emotions can\r\nfail to be uplifted by the story of the _Varyag's_ passage to death. It\r\nis well to know that the cold science of modern naval warfare and all\r\nthose mathematical calculations and inventions which have displaced the\r\nancient ascendency of brawn and muscle at close quarters have not\r\nquenched the eager spirit of the sailor, or diminished his \"heroic\r\nsuperstitions and his strutting and vainglorious style of fight.\" It\r\nwas with a spirit not less high and intrepid that the captain of the\r\nlittle _Korietz_, disregarding the orders of his superior officer to\r\nremain within the shelter of the harbor, followed in his wake and\r\nstrove desperately to meet the same fate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Target for Japanese Gunners]\r\n\r\nSlowly but steadily the two ships held on their course towards the\r\nPolynesian Archipelago, where lay in wait their powerful foe. The\r\n_Varyag_ had reached Round Island, when at a distance of nearly two\r\nmiles the Japanese flagship opened fire with one of her big guns. The\r\naim of the gunners was true. Right amidships burst the great missile,\r\ndoing terrible execution, and shell after shell followed with\r\nrelentless rapidity. The _Varyag_, wheeling around in a small circle,\r\nresponded dauntlessly with her 6-inch guns, but with little or no\r\neffect upon the battleship, and now Admiral Uriu's cruisers joined in\r\nthe cannonade. Within half an hour of this fearful raking fire her\r\nbridge was shot away and her sides were gaping with holes, but she kept\r\nafloat and still withstood the onslaught, endeavoring heroically but in\r\nvain to find an opening by which to break through and escape out to\r\nsea. At last, after an hour's terrible pounding, she was compelled\r\nreluctantly to give up the attempt as hopeless, and, taking refuge\r\namong the islands, with difficulty crept back into Chemulpo harbor,\r\ndisabled beyond repair and with her decks reduced to veritable\r\nshambles. Her desperate struggle had not left the enemy utterly\r\nscathless, for there seems no doubt that one of the Japanese cruisers\r\nreceived a good deal of damage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Plucky \"Korietz\"]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the little _Korietz_, with extraordinary bravery, but\r\nwith absolutely pathetic ineffectiveness, had been attempting to\r\nimitate the manoeuvres of her consort and to do some injury to the\r\nbig ships of the enemy. As well might a warrior with a popgun try to\r\nengage a battery of field artillery. It was magnificent, it certainly\r\nwas not war. The range was hopelessly beyond her powers, and perhaps it\r\nwas the bitterest drop in the cup of her commander and crew that the\r\nJapanese soon ceased to pay her any attention at all, concentrating all\r\ntheir efforts upon the more dangerous _Varyag_. When that vessel\r\nretreated at length into harbor, the _Korietz_ followed her unharmed\r\nbut undisgraced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wounding and Burning]\r\n\r\nThe wounded of the _Varyag_, numbering 4 officers and 214 men, were\r\nremoved in boats to the British, Italian and French warships. The dead\r\nwere left on board, for it was decided to scuttle the ship. At the same\r\ntime arrangements were made to blow up the _Korietz_. Just as the\r\nJapanese fleet again appeared in sight the latter vessel blew up, and\r\nthe shattered hull, after one great burst of flame and smoke, sank\r\nbeneath the waters. The _Varyag_ refused to sink so easily, and the\r\nRussian sailors therefore again boarded her to set her on fire. After a\r\nlittle more than an hour she had burned down to the water's edge and,\r\nheeling over, disappeared. The _Sungari_ was the next to meet its fate,\r\nthe Russians setting fire to it also to prevent its falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese fleet then steamed out to sea once more, having left\r\nbehind it no further obstacle to the landing of troops on the west\r\ncoast of Korea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Handicap]\r\n\r\nThus within forty-eight hours of the rupture of diplomatic relations,\r\nthe first decisive action in the struggle for sea-supremacy had been\r\nfought, and the result left to the enterprising and intrepid Navy of\r\nJapan not only the immense moral value of a victory well contrived and\r\nunerringly accomplished, but the solid material advantage of a\r\nsuperiority in fighting strength which was incontestable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n       GENERAL LINEVITCH.

The first course of action for the victor in\r\nsuch a case is to keep on striking and to give the harassed foe no\r\nrest--in the striking words of Captain Mahan, to \"benumb the victim.\"\r\nThis was precisely the plan of campaign adopted by the Japanese, who\r\ncontinued to show the same remarkable skill and coolness of\r\ncalculation, and the same dash and daring in execution as had\r\ncharacterized their naval operations from the first. On the other hand,\r\nthe disorganization of the Russian fleet, and of the defending force at\r\nPort Arthur generally, showed itself more markedly than ever, and the\r\nincapacity of the Czar's commanders conspired to aid the enterprise of\r\nthe Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nBefore entering, however, upon a narrative of the attacks upon Port\r\nArthur which followed in swift succession upon the great battle of the\r\n9th, it may be well to give some description of that famous stronghold.\r\nThe inner harbor is oval in shape, and two miles long from east to west\r\nand a mile in breadth from north to south. The shores are protected by\r\nhills, which the Russians had assiduously fortified since they obtained\r\noccupation of the place. Entrance is afforded from the south by a\r\nnarrow channel, so narrow indeed that while it has the advantage of\r\nbeing easily held against an enemy, it has the counteracting\r\ndisadvantage of being somewhat difficult of navigation for the ships of\r\nthe defending fleet. The mouth of this channel is protected on the\r\nsouthwest by two dangerous reefs, which would prove a snare to an\r\nunwary foe; while on the eastern shore there stands the hill of\r\nKwang-chin-shan, 250 feet above the sea level, upon which frown the\r\nguns of several powerful batteries. Upon the lower slopes the Russians\r\nhad established two batteries of Canet quick-firing 5.5in. and 7.5mm.\r\nguns, with a torpedo and searchlight station. The entrance channel is\r\nflanked along the northwest by a narrow strip of land which goes by the\r\nexpressive name of the \"Tiger's Tail,\" and this strip was fortified\r\nwith battery of 7 Canet 5.5in. quick-firing guns. The distance from the\r\nPinnacle Rock, one of the reefs above mentioned as situated at the\r\nwestern corner of the entrance passage, to the opposite shore, is\r\nnearly 350 yards. In its course the channel narrows, till at one point\r\nit is only 500 feet in width, but it widens out again at the northern\r\nend. At the northeastern end lies the basin, or East Port. There is\r\naccommodation here for about a dozen large men-of-war, and on the north\r\nside stands the one dry dock for repairing large vessels of which Port\r\nArthur can boast. On the other side of the channel, which at this point\r\nis 430 yards in width, lies the mouth of the harbor proper, facing the\r\nsoutheast. To enter it, ships have to round the Tiger's Tail, not a\r\nparticularly easy process for men-of-war of the largest size. Nor is\r\nthe harbor itself yet fitted to receive a great fleet. When the\r\nRussians took it over they found that it was too shallow for berthing\r\nvessels even of a moderate size; and in spite of the feverish activity\r\nof their engineers in the last year or two, the dredging operations\r\nhave not proceeded far enough to allow of accommodations for more than\r\nthree battleships, together with minor craft. Hence the Port Arthur\r\nsquadron has generally been disposed either in the East Port, or basin,\r\nor in the open roadstead outside the entrance channel. It was indeed\r\nthe position of the Russian ships in this latter anchorage that gave\r\nthe Japanese the opportunity for their fatal torpedo attack on the 8th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE HARBOR OF PORT ARTHUR._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Forts]\r\n\r\nThe land defences of Port Arthur were exceptionally strong. A range of\r\nforts, of which the Kwang-chin Hill already mentioned was the most\r\nimportant, commanded the harbor entrance; and another range of\r\nbatteries, with the most powerful and up-to-date garrison ordnance,\r\nsurmounted the hills which surround the town and protect it on the\r\nother side. Another line of forts guards the entrance channel on the\r\nwest side, the most important being Wei-yuen. It seemed, indeed,\r\nundoubted that Port Arthur was impregnable from the sea, though at the\r\nbeginning of the war European experts were not inclined to dogmatize as\r\nto the possibilities of its being stormed from the land side. As for\r\nthe fleet, if it were lying in the West Harbor or in the East Port\r\nunder the shadow of Kwan-chin, it would probably be perfectly safe from\r\nattack; but, on the other hand, it will be seen that there was a danger\r\nthat the narrow entrance channel might be blocked up by an enterprising\r\nenemy, in which case the Czar's ships, even if they were the finest in\r\nthe world, would be useless for all the essential purposes of naval\r\nwarfare. This attempt to \"cork up the bottle\" was, indeed, nearly\r\ncarried out by Admiral Togo in the course of the fortnight following\r\nthe outbreak of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another Russian Disaster]\r\n\r\nTwo days after the great attack another disaster befell the hapless\r\nRussians. With this the Japanese fleet, which had retired temporarily\r\nto the Elliot Islands in the Korean Gulf to refit and repair injuries,\r\nhad nothing to do. It was solely due to carelessness and mischance; and\r\nwhile illustrating the state of demoralization that existed at Port\r\nArthur, it contributed to spread that demoralization still further\r\namong the already sufficiently harassed forces of the defenders. The\r\nmine transport _Yenesei_, which, with her sister ship the _Amur_, was\r\nengaged in superintending the mine defences of the harbor entrance,\r\nobserving a submarine mine which had become detached floating on the\r\nsurface of the water, approached it for the purpose of firing upon it\r\nand thus removing an obvious danger to the ships lying at anchor.\r\nUnfortunately, in the excitement of the process, Captain Stepanoff, who\r\nwas in command, allowed his ship to drift upon a neighboring mine. A\r\nterrific explosion followed, and the _Yenesei_, with a yawning hole in\r\nher bows, began at once to settle down. An attempt was made to lower\r\nthe boats, but the catastrophe was so sudden and unexpected that little\r\ncould be done. Captain Stepanoff went down with his ship, and there\r\nperished also, either from the direct effects of the explosion or from\r\ndrowning, the engineer, two midshipmen and ninety-two men of lower\r\nrank. Not only was this terrible disaster damaging to the _morale_ of\r\nthe fleet, but it deprived Admiral Alexeieff of a valuable ship and of\r\nstores which he could ill spare. The _Yenesei_ was built at Kronstadt\r\nin 1898. She was of 2,500 tons displacement, with a speed of 17-1/2\r\nknots; was armed with five 4.7-inch and six smaller quick-firing guns,\r\nand was capable of carrying 500 mines. It is, of course, possible that\r\nshe had not that full number on board at the time of the explosion, but\r\nin any case the loss in this respect alone must have been very severe.\r\nThe accident throws an instructive and rather terrifying light upon the\r\npossible dangers of submarine mines, not only to the enemy who are\r\nattacking a fortified port, but also to the defenders themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Night Attack]\r\n\r\nBefore the Russians at Port Arthur had recovered from this\r\nnerve-shaking disaster the tireless foe flew at their throat once more.\r\nOn the night of the 13th a flotilla of Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers\r\nstarted out to make another dash at the survivors of the Czar's fleet,\r\nwhich were still lying in the open roadstead, presenting for a daring\r\nand resourceful enemy a tempting object of attack. The flotilla was\r\nunder the command of Captain Nagai. A blinding snowstorm was raging at\r\nthe time, and it was no wonder in the circumstances that the vessels\r\nbecame separated from one another and that some lost their way\r\naltogether. But two, more fortunate than their fellows, hit the right\r\ncourse. These were the _Asagiri_, under Captain Iakawa, and the\r\n_Hayatori_, commanded by Captain Takanouchi. A snowstorm on that coast\r\nis enough to tax the skill and the courage of the most intrepid sailor,\r\nbut the Japanese officers and crews were equal to the occasion. Right\r\nin the teeth of the awful blizzard, their decks sheeted with ice and\r\nsnow, but with hearts on board hot with the fire of heroic adventure,\r\nthe gallant little craft held steadily on their way. The navigating\r\nlieutenants had to find their course more by instinct than by\r\ncalculation, for it was impossible to see anything clearly ahead\r\nthrough the pitch-darkness and the relentless snow. On, however, they\r\ncrept through the terrible night, each working independently of the\r\nother, for under such conditions no concerted plan of attack was\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Daring]\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning of the 14th, the _Asagiri_ reached the\r\nharbor mouth, and in she dashed regardless of the searchlights, which\r\nmade broad, livid tracks even through the storm of snow. A hot fire at\r\nonce broke out from the fortress and the ships, but the aim of the\r\ngunners was wild, and, undaunted by the perils of his situation,\r\nCaptain Iakawa drove his boat right up to the Russian torpedo flotilla,\r\nand discharged a torpedo at one of the larger vessels, from whose\r\nfunnels smoke was seen ascending. The deadly weapon went home, and\r\nafter waiting to see that it exploded, the _Asagiri_ engaged in a smart\r\nexchange of shots with the enemy's torpedo boats and destroyers, in the\r\ncourse of which she sent a \"scout\" to the bottom. Then, and not till\r\nthen, did her brave commander withdraw. Turning out to sea once more,\r\nand still hotly replying to the Russian fire until she was out of\r\nrange, the _Asagiri_ safely escaped, covered with honor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demons of the Storm]\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the _Hayatori_ arrived upon the scene and performed the\r\nsame gallant feat. Still facing the terrors of the storm, she\r\napproached the harbor entrance and stealthily crept up to the fleet,\r\nwhich lay helplessly at anchor. At last the audacious little destroyer\r\nwas discovered. Two vessels opened a fierce fire upon her, but without\r\nhesitation, though at the same time with the most deliberate coolness\r\nand perfect aim, she discharged a torpedo at the nearest ship. The\r\nmissile was seen to explode, and then, like her consort, the _Asagiri_,\r\nfled safely to sea once more, after spiritedly returning the hot\r\nfusillade directed upon her from all quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral Effect]\r\n\r\nIn the characteristically restrained dispatch in which Admiral Togo\r\ndescribed this brilliant feat of arms by the _Asagiri_ and the\r\n_Hayatori_, he remarked:--\"It is impossible to state the definite\r\nmaterial results, owing to the darkness, but the moral effect was\r\ncertainly considerable.\" From other sources, however, something was\r\nlearned of the character of the material damage done to the Russian\r\nfleet Not only was a scout destroyed, but the cruiser _Boyarin_ was\r\ninjured by one of the torpedoes, and the Volunteer Fleet steamer\r\n_Kayan_ had her upper works knocked about by a shell from one of the\r\nRussian guns. The exact amount of the damage done was not revealed on\r\nthe Russian side, but there can at all events be no doubt that, in the\r\nwords of the Japanese Admiral, the moral effect was considerable. It is\r\nclear from the safe return of these two small destroyers out of the\r\nvery jaws of the enemy, that the Russian gunners had become\r\ndemoralized, and the ineffectiveness of Admiral Alexeieff's own torpedo\r\nflotilla in the face of an attack which it was peculiarly designed to\r\nmeet points strongly in the same direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN FLEET TRYING TO LEAVE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bottling up Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nBut still a third harassing attack was in store for the Russian fleet.\r\nWhile one division of his torpedo-boat destroyers was thus carrying\r\nconfusion and dismay into the ranks of his opponents, Admiral Togo,\r\nholding his main fleet within the shelter of the Elliot Islands, was\r\nquietly preparing for a larger and more far-reaching _coup_. This was\r\nto be nothing less than the operation of \"corking up the bottle,\" in\r\nother words sinking ships at the entrance to Port Arthur Harbor, and\r\nblocking the fairway against passage of the Russian ships. It was an\r\nenterprise in some ways similar to the famous exploit of Lieutenant\r\nHobson of the _Merrimac_ at Santiago-de-Cuba during the\r\nSpanish-American War, but in the present case the blockading fleet\r\nattained less success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fire Ships]\r\n\r\nFive old steamers were chartered for the purpose. Their names were the\r\n_Tenshin Maru_, the _Bushu Maru_, the _Buyo Maru_, the _Hokoku Maru_,\r\nand the _Jinsen Maru_. Two of these, under the names of the _Rohilla_\r\nand the _Brindisi_, were formerly in the service of the Peninsular and\r\nOriental Company. It may here be remarked that the spirit animating all\r\nranks of the Japanese in this war was shown by the numbers of\r\nvolunteers who came forward for the dangerous task of manning the\r\ndoomed steamers. The difficulty, indeed, was not to find sufficient\r\nmen, but to select the limited force required without giving offence to\r\nthe remainder of the host who sought to share in the glorious risk. At\r\nlast, however, the officers and crews were chosen, and the vessels,\r\nhaving been carefully filled with heavy stones and explosives, left for\r\nPort Arthur on the morning of the 23rd of February, escorted by a\r\nflotilla of torpedo boats and destroyers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fire and Searchlight]\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the early morning of the 24th, they reached the\r\nroadstead outside Port Arthur, the _Tenshin Maru_ leading the way. The\r\nRussians, however, were more vigilant than on former occasions, and\r\ntheir searchlights soon revealed the renewed presence of their\r\ninsatiable enemy. The _Tenshin Maru_, steering too far to the left,\r\ncame within the fire of the batteries on the Tiger's Tail at close\r\nrange. She was disabled by a shell, ran upon the rocks three miles to\r\nthe southwest of the harbor entrance, and there blew up. The other\r\nsteamers changed their course to the northeast, but the attentions of\r\nthe Russian searchlight operators rendered their progress highly\r\ndifficult and dangerous, and they were soon the object of a positive\r\nstorm of fire from the forts on the Tiger's Tail, Golden Hill, and\r\nElectric Cliff, and also from the damaged _Retvisan_, which lay\r\ngrounded at the entrance to the channel. The _Bushu Maru_ was the first\r\nto suffer from the cannonade. Her steering gear was carried away, and,\r\nstaggering blindly to the west, she grounded close to the _Tenshin\r\nMaru_, blew up, and sank. The fate of the _Buyo Maru_ was no better.\r\nShe was raked fore and aft by the Russian shells, and before she could\r\nreach the coveted entrance she also exploded and sank beneath the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rain of Shells]\r\n\r\nThe _Hokoku Maru_ and the _Jinsen Maru_ were more successful. They made\r\na rush together for the harbor channel, and got close up to the\r\n_Retvisan_. Disregarding the heavy fire directed upon them from the\r\ndisabled but still dangerous monster, the adventurous volunteers calmly\r\nanchored their vessels upon the spot previously selected. Then only did\r\nthey set the match to the fuses. Cheering loudly, but with no undue\r\nprecipitation, they now took to the boats and pulled away in perfect\r\norder, in spite of the rain of shells and bullets showered around them\r\non every side. The abandoned steamers blew up immediately afterwards\r\nand sank close to the lighthouse at the channel mouth. The activity of\r\nthe Russian searchlights and the hot fire from the guns of the\r\n_Retvisan_ and the forts compelled the men in the boats to take a very\r\nroundabout course, and they could not regain the Japanese torpedo\r\nfleet, which in the meantime had successfully picked up the crews of\r\nthe other sunken ships. But the situation of the sailors of the _Hokoku\r\nMaru_ and the _Jinsen Maru_ was full of peril. To add to their\r\ndifficulties, the wind rose to a gale towards daybreak, and they were\r\ndriven out of their course. But they struggled bravely on, and, after\r\nenduring great hardships, they managed to reach the main fleet about\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon. According to the Japanese Admiral's\r\nreport, all engaged returned in safety from this dangerous enterprise,\r\nan achievement comparable to the most daring \"cutting-out\" expeditions\r\nof olden times. It should be added that not a single destroyer or\r\ntorpedo-boat was injured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians Still in the Wood]\r\n\r\nOwing to the failure of three of the steamers to reach the entrance of\r\nthe channel, and the insufficient size of the two which were\r\nsuccessfully sunk there, the main object of the scheme was not\r\nattained, but it is thought that some temporary inconvenience was\r\ncaused to the Russians, especially as the position of the grounded\r\n_Retvisan_ herself was already something of an impediment to\r\nnavigation. Extraordinary jubilation was created in the Czar's\r\ndominions, particularly in the Capital, by the failure of the Japanese\r\nexpeditions. It was at first thought by the defending force, in the\r\ndarkness and confusion, that the merchant steamers were men-of-war, and\r\na grandiloquent account was sent to St. Petersburg by an imaginative\r\ncorrespondent announcing no less a disaster to the Japanese than the\r\ndestruction of four of their battleships, after a severe engagement in\r\nwhich the wounded _Retvisan_ had covered herself with glory. The news\r\nwas quickly transmitted abroad by the semi-official agency, and the\r\ngreatest excitement was caused in every capital in Europe. Cool-headed\r\npeople, nevertheless, waited for some confirmation of this remarkable\r\nstory, and when the truth came out the partisans of Russia were\r\nchagrined to find what a different complexion the real facts wore.\r\nAdmiral Alexeieff, however, after the previous disasters which had\r\nbefallen his fleet, was to be pardoned, perhaps, for the somewhat\r\nexultant tone of his dispatch to the Czar, in which he attributed what\r\nhe called \"the complete derangement of the enemy's plan\" to \"the\r\nbrilliant resistance and destructive fire of the _Retvisan_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Blockade]\r\n\r\nUndiscouraged by the failure of this attempt to bottle up the enemy,\r\nAdmiral Togo continued to maintain a strict blockade of the port, and\r\nto pursue the policy of alternate torpedo attacks and heavy\r\nbombardments at frequent intervals. But before proceeding with the\r\nstory of these damaging and disconcerting operations, it will be\r\nconvenient to describe the course which events were taking in other\r\nquarters of the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transport Problems]\r\n\r\nThe signal success of Japan at sea had reduced to comparatively simple\r\nproportion the problem of the transport of her forces to the seat of\r\nwar on land, where the curtain was about to rise on the most desperate\r\nact in the great drama. With half the Russian fleet at Port Arthur\r\ndisabled, with the other half confined to the harbor by strict\r\nblockade, and with the Vladivistock cruiser squadron reduced to\r\nineffective isolation, the Mikado's military advisers were able to\r\nchoose the most convenient landing-places in Korea with a freedom which\r\nwas only limited by the difficulties of the winter season. This indeed\r\nwas a serious impediment to the movement of troops in large numbers.\r\nNot only were most of the available harbors both in Korea and on the\r\nLiao-tung Peninsula blocked by the ice, but when the invading force\r\nlanded it found the roads in such a state as to render them almost\r\nimpassable. The country was covered with snow several inches deep; the\r\nfrost was biting; and even when milder weather began to prevail the\r\nconditions did not at once prove more favorable to marching operations\r\nand to the conveyance of heavy artillery. For the time being, in fact,\r\nthey grew worse rather than better, for the thaw produced a perfect sea\r\nof mud, which made progress northwards a terribly slow and painful\r\nbusiness. Anyone who has tried to cross a ploughed field during the\r\nbreak up of a prolonged frost can form some idea--faint, however, at\r\nthe best--of the pleasures of marching in Korea at the beginning of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secrecy of Japanese Movements]\r\n\r\nIn spite, nevertheless, of all the natural difficulties of the\r\nsituation, the Japanese proceeded steadily and systematically to \"weave\r\nthe crimson web of war.\" Nothing has been more remarkable in the course\r\nof these operations both by sea and by land than the complete secrecy\r\nwith which the Mikado's strategists have veiled all their important\r\nmovements until the calculated blow has been struck. In this, of\r\ncourse, they have been aided by their speedy acquisition of the command\r\nof the sea. All the correspondents who have proceeded to the seat of\r\nwar agree in paying mortified tributes to the thoroughness of the\r\nJapanese press censorship. For weeks together a great army of\r\n\"specials\" were condemned idly to kick their heels at Nagasaki, while\r\nbefore their eyes transport after transport, crowded with soldiery, was\r\nleaving that port for unknown destinations. It was, however, generally\r\nevident on the face of the broad facts of the situation, that the main\r\nobjective of the Japanese armies at that time was the west coast of\r\nKorea; for though the ports in the district were undoubtedly difficult\r\nof access on account of the ice, the condition of things on the\r\nLiao-tung Peninsula, the other probable place of disembarkation, was\r\nvery much worse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admirable Arrangements]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of February over forty transports sailed from Nagasaki,\r\nand a still larger embarkation went on at Ujina, near Hiroshima, where\r\na great force of horse, foot, and artillery were steadily detrained\r\nevery day and sent on board. The admirable arrangements made by the\r\nJapanese directors of mobilization and transport were the theme of\r\nuniversal praise among unprejudiced observers. Everything had been\r\ncarefully thought out beforehand; all the necessary material was ready;\r\nand consequently, when war broke out, there was no confusion, no undue\r\nhaste--only the ordered bustle of men who knew exactly what they had to\r\ndo and how it was to be done, down to the veriest detail. Special\r\nwharves had been prepared and were in position within a few days, with\r\nrailway lines laid upon them, connecting them with the main lines over\r\nwhich the troops travelled from the interior, so that the trains could\r\nbe brought down almost to the water's edge. Here the soldiers were\r\ndetrained, and, after a meal, embarked upon lighters and steam\r\nlaunches, and were conveyed swiftly to the ships to which they were\r\nassigned. These transports averaged 6,000 tons in burden, and were\r\nexcellently fitted up for their purpose. An important part of the\r\nvessels' equipment in each case was a number of large surf-boats or\r\nsampans, about the most useful form of boat possible for landing troops\r\nin the shoal waters of the Korean harbors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Close Censorship]\r\n\r\nWhat was taking place in the meanwhile on the other side of the\r\nchannel, and particularly upon the western coast of the Hermit Kingdom?\r\nWe now know something of the strength and the disposition of the\r\nJapanese forces, although right up to the last moment before the\r\ngeneral advance only the smallest items of information were allowed to\r\npass through the narrow-meshed net of the censorship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Landings]\r\n\r\nAccording to the most trustworthy accounts, however, there seems little\r\ndoubt that the chief point of disembarkation of the Mikado's army was\r\nChinampo, a small and obscure treaty port situated about 150 miles\r\nnorth of Chemulpo. We have already related the landing of the Japanese\r\nadvance guard at Chemulpo on February 8th, before the naval battle\r\nwhich resulted in the destruction of the _Varyag_ and the _Korietz_.\r\nThis force, which belonged to the 12th Infantry Division under General\r\nInouye, and consisted of 2,500 men, was billeted at once in the little\r\ntown, and was followed during the next few days by the remainder of the\r\nDivision, with transport corps, train, and engineers. When the Mikado's\r\nadvisers had been assured of the success of the initial naval\r\noperations and of Admiral Togo's supremacy at sea, a small expedition\r\nwas immediately landed near Haiju, a place situated about half-way\r\nbetween Chemulpo and Chinampo, and sent forward by the Seoul-Wiju road\r\nto seize Ping-Yang, a strategical point the importance of which was\r\namply demonstrated in the Chino-Japanese war. The main body of General\r\nInouye's Division followed with all possible speed from Chemulpo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrible Weather]\r\n\r\nThe hardships which these troops had to face were terrible indeed. The\r\nweather was at its worst. Heavy rain was succeeded by frost, and on the\r\ntop of the frost came snow, and cruel blinding blizzards, in the teeth\r\nof which the little Japs, each man burdened with a weight of 100 lbs.,\r\nhad to struggle as best they could. In the circumstances the\r\nachievement of these forerunners of the Mikado's main army did an\r\nadmirable piece of work. They did a steady march of 25 miles a day,\r\nbivouacking in the dirty Korean villages by night. At last, after four\r\nor five days, the force reached Ping-Yang and proceeded with all\r\nexpedition to fortify it against possible attack. By the end of\r\nFebruary a considerable body of troops was in occupation of Ping-Yang,\r\nand patrols were being pushed northwards to Anju.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Ping-Yang]\r\n\r\nThe seizure of this strong position, providing as it did against any\r\nimmediate danger from the north, enabled the Japanese to land higher up\r\nthe coast than Chemulpo, and henceforth the main work of disembarkation\r\nin this quarter was carried on at Chinampo, access to which is gained\r\nby an arm of the sea called the Ping-Yang Inlet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perfect Organization]\r\n\r\nHere we find the complement of the operations which at Nagasaki and\r\nUjina excited such keen admiration on the part of foreign critics.\r\nPerfect order and discipline characterized the disembarkation of the\r\nJapanese, as it had characterized their embarkation. The Pink-Yang\r\nInlet is difficult of navigation at the best of times, but the inherent\r\ndifficulties were enormously enhanced at this period of the year by the\r\ndrift ice, which rendered landing an awkward and, in some cases, a\r\nhazardous undertaking. But the Japanese showed that admirable\r\nforethought which has characterized every step they have taken, and the\r\ntransports brought with them large numbers of pontoon wharves, which\r\nenabled the troops to disembark from the sampans at some distance from\r\nthe shore, and to march easily on to firm land. Here the hardy\r\nJapanese, in spite of the severe cold, bivouacked for the most part in\r\nthe open, and were then pushed forward with all possible rapidity\r\ntowards Ping-Yang. By the middle of March, as far as can be estimated,\r\nat least 80,000 men had landed in Korea ready to advance northwards as\r\nsoon as the weather would permit; General Kuroki, commanding the 1st\r\nArmy Corps, assuming the direction of affairs until the arrival of\r\nBaron Kodama, the Chief of the General Staff, who had been appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE DESTROYERS AT CLOSE QUARTERS, MARCH\r\n9TH.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Seoul]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile a strong force, under General Inouye, had marched upon\r\nSeoul, and without difficulty overawed the feeble Emperor and his\r\ncorrupt Court. On the 12th of February M. Pavloff, whose name had for\r\nso long been a word to conjure with in Korea, left the capital for\r\nChemulpo under the humiliating protection of a Japanese guard. M.\r\nPavloff, it is said, was thunderstruck by the news of the disasters to\r\nthe Russian navy, and by the sudden revelation of the real strength of\r\nthe hitherto despised Island Empire. It was now clear to the world, and\r\nnot least to his dupes, the Koreans, that the diplomatic bluff in which\r\nhe, in common with his administrative chief, Admiral Alexeieff, had\r\nbeen indulging for so long was ludicrously out of proportion to the\r\nnaval and military preparations which would ultimately have to support\r\nit. But the power of this able man at the Court of Seoul, though broken\r\nfor the moment, was not by any means destroyed. So well had he done his\r\nwork that even in the hour of Japan's triumph he still managed to find\r\ntools in the corrupt servants of the Emperor, and when he had taken his\r\ndeparture for Shanghai more than one attempt to communicate with him\r\nhad to be frustrated by the Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Korean Emperor]\r\n\r\nFor the time being, however, the star of Japan was unquestionably in\r\nthe ascendant at Seoul. The Emperor hastened to congratulate the Mikado\r\non the victory of his fleet, and assured him that in view of Korea's\r\nposition her satisfaction equalled that of the Japanese. At the same\r\ntime the Korean local officials were ordered by the central Government\r\nto give every facility to the invading troops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Japanese Protectorate]\r\n\r\nBut a more definite acknowledgment of Japanese supremacy followed. On\r\nFebruary 23rd an important agreement was signed at Seoul by M. Hayashi,\r\nthe Minister of the Mikado, and General Yi-Chi-Yong, the Korean\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs. By the terms of this Protocol, Korea,\r\n\"convinced of Japan's friendship,\" undertook to adopt the advice of the\r\nJapanese Government in regard to administrative reform \"with a view to\r\nconsolidating the peace of the Orient.\" On the other hand, Japan\r\nguaranteed the safety of the Imperial family and the independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of Korea. In pursuance of this provision, the\r\nfourth Article declared that an encroachment by a third Power, or an\r\ninternal disturbance resulting in danger to either of these interests,\r\nwould justify prompt measures on the part of Japan, who would receive\r\nassistance from Korea, and in order to give effect to such action Japan\r\nmight occupy strategical points in Korea if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantage to Japan]\r\n\r\nThe object of this agreement was, of course, to regularize Japan's\r\nposition in the eyes of the Powers and at the same time to give a sop\r\nto the dignity of Korea. Its most important point, as far as the future\r\nwas concerned, was the definite guarantee on the part of Japan of the\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Hermit Kingdom. The\r\nsignificance of this action of the Mikado's Government, as foretelling\r\nthe lines of their permanent policy in the event of a final victory\r\nover the forces of the Czar, was heightened by the visit to Seoul a few\r\nweeks afterwards, on a special mission, of Japan's most famous\r\nstatesman, the Marquis Ito. The attention was reciprocated by the\r\ndispatch of a special envoy from the Korean Court to Tokio. The most\r\nimportant immediate effect, however, of the complete ascendancy now\r\nacquired by Japan at Seoul was of military rather than of civil\r\ninterest. This was the granting of a concession to the Japanese under\r\nArticle 4 of the Protocol, for the construction of the projected\r\nrailway between Seoul and Wiju, on the Yalu River, while at the same\r\ntime arrangements were made for the completion of the southern portion\r\nof the line between Seoul and Fusan, a port at the southern extremity\r\nof Korea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Railway Building]\r\n\r\nHere the marvelous organization of the Japanese War Office came into\r\nevidence once more. All the preparations for acting upon this\r\nconcession had already been made. The material which had been intended\r\nfor the construction of some unimportant railways in Japan was at hand\r\nready to be transferred to the seat of war, and the engineer and\r\npioneer corps only waited for the conclusion of the necessary\r\nformalities to begin operations. On March 8th a body of 8,000 men\r\nstarted work on the line between Seoul and Wiju, and the enterprise was\r\nconducted at high pressure, the material being conveyed with all\r\npossible speed by steamers from Japan. The value of this railway for\r\nstrategical purposes will be obvious to anyone who studies the map;\r\nand, more fortunate than the Russians, the Japanese, provided that they\r\ncould hold the northern part of Korea at all, were not likely to be\r\nfaced with the difficulties which had proved so embarrassing to their\r\nenemy, in the shape of brigands and train-wreckers, in Manchuria. The\r\ncompletion of the whole line as far as Fusan would furthermore make\r\nthem practically independent of sea transport for men as well as\r\nsupplies, except, of course, as far as the narrow Korean Channel is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Rapidity]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, considering the inevitable delay due to the\r\nseverity of the season, the preparations for a general advance by the\r\nJapanese army had been conducted with remarkable celerity and success,\r\nand that by the middle of March great progress had been made.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the Russian side of the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dismay at St. Petersburg]\r\n\r\nOne of the first consequences of the reverses at Port Arthur was a\r\nchange in the commands. The unexpected collapse of the Russian navy\r\nunder the attacks of the despised Japanese caused grave searchings of\r\nheart at St. Petersburg, and there can be no doubt that the Czar\r\nhimself was greatly shocked by the revelation both of the lack of\r\nreadiness of his fleet and of the strange paralysis of enterprise on\r\nthe part of the Admiral in command. It was not long before the Imperial\r\ndispleasure was visited upon this officer, Admiral Starck. On the 16th\r\nof February he was formally superseded, and Admiral Makaroff,\r\nCommander-in-Chief at Kronstadt, and a sailor of proved energy and\r\nskill, was appointed to the command of the Pacific Fleet in his place.\r\nThe official reason, indeed, which was given out for Admiral Starck's\r\nrecall was \"ill-health,\" but this ingenious euphemism deceived nobody,\r\nthe less so because the same mysterious complaint simultaneously seized\r\nhold of Rear-Admiral Molas, his second Chief of the Staff, who was\r\nrecalled in the same Imperial Ukase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexeieff Criticized]\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy himself did not escape criticism at the hands of the\r\nRussian public, and in official circles at St. Petersburg keen censure\r\nwas bestowed upon him for his share in the disasters which had befallen\r\nthe fleet under his control; but he still appeared to retain the\r\nconfidence of his master the Czar. It soon became apparent, however,\r\nthat the military problem in Manchuria presented difficulties of its\r\nown hardly less embarrassing than those which were being experienced at\r\nsea, and as the magnitude of the task dawned upon the Czar and his\r\nadvisers, it was deemed necessary to take drastic measures. On February\r\n21st, therefore, the celebrated General Kuropatkin, Minister for War,\r\nand the first Russian military strategist of the day, was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the land forces in the Far East. It was carefully\r\nexplained that Admiral Alexeieff, as a naval officer, could not be\r\nexpected to conduct great operations on land, but it was apparent to\r\neveryone that as these land operations were now destined finally to\r\ndecide the issue of the great conflict, the direction of the whole war\r\non the Russian side had virtually passed to General Kuropatkin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Kuropatkin]\r\n\r\nSome slight account of this famous captain may not be out of place\r\nhere. Like so many of Russia's distinguished men, both in the past and\r\nin the present, Alexis Nikolaievitch Kuropatkin has owed his rise\r\nrather to merit than to influence. His family was indeed a noble one,\r\nbut it was little known, and his early advancement in the service was\r\ndue to his own ability and industry, and not to high connections. When\r\nquite young, however, he was fortunate enough to attract the attention\r\nof the celebrated Skobeleff, and he became a great favorite as well as\r\na zealous disciple of that famous cavalry leader. His opportunity came\r\nin the Russo-Turkish War, where he displayed notable dash and\r\ngallantry, risking his life recklessly in the terrible conflict at\r\nPlevna. In crossing the Balkans he captured a large Turkish force, and\r\nwas promoted to the command of a division. Towards the close of the war\r\nhe became Chief of the Staff to Skobeleff, and in the campaign against\r\nthe Turkomans, which followed, and which resulted in the conquest of\r\nTurkestan, he served that great General in the same capacity. His rise\r\nwas indeed remarkably rapid; promotion came to him while he was young\r\nand active enough to make the best use of it; and although he had held\r\nthe highest position in the army--the Ministry for War--for some years,\r\nhis age was now only fifty-six. Like most successful men, he was not\r\nwithout his critics and detractors--it was said indeed that among these\r\nwas to be found Admiral Alexeieff himself, and that there was no love\r\nlost between the two--but there can be no doubt of the General's\r\nimmense popularity with the army. His appointment to the supreme\r\ncommand caused a universal feeling of relief to spread not only\r\nthroughout the Service, but throughout all classes of society in\r\nRussia, while at the same time it proved that the real seriousness of\r\nthe task which lay then in the Far East had at last been grasped by the\r\nCzar's Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confessions of Weakness]\r\n\r\nFor a time indeed the haughty disdain of their puny foe, which had\r\ncharacterized Russian official circles before the war, was succeeded by\r\na feeling of acute pessimism. To prepare the public for the worst, an\r\nofficial _communique_ was issued at St. Petersburg, in which, after an\r\noutburst of well affected indignation against the so-called treachery\r\nof the enemy, the people were warned that much time was necessary in\r\norder to strike at Japan blows \"worthy of the dignity and might of\r\nRussia,\" while the state of unpreparedness on land as well as at sea\r\nwas revealed in the phrase, \"the distance of the territory now attached\r\nand the desire of the Czar to maintain peace were the causes of the\r\nimpossibility of preparations for war being made a long time in\r\nadvance.\" Simultaneously with the issue of this extraordinary\r\nconfession came the news that Admiral Alexeieff with his staff had left\r\nPort Arthur and proceeded to Harbin, at the junction of the Manchurian\r\nrailway and the branch line to Vladivostock, there to effect a\r\nconcentration of all the available Russian forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desperate Efforts]\r\n\r\nThese facts combined were generally taken as indicating the intention\r\nof the Czar's Government to abandon Port Arthur and Southern Manchuria,\r\nfor the time being, to their fate, and to make the first real stand\r\nagainst the enemy on the borders of Eastern Siberia. Desperate,\r\nhowever, as the situation appeared to be in these early days of the\r\nwar, it undoubtedly improved somewhat in the next few weeks, and the\r\ndelay which the severe climatic conditions imposed upon the Japanese\r\nadvance necessarily aided the Russians. General Linevitch, commander of\r\nthe Siberian Army Corps, to whom the direction of military affairs was\r\nentrusted pending the arrival of General Kuropatkin, made desperate\r\nexertions to collect an effective force as far south as possible, and\r\nit was regarded as highly probable, from such scraps of news as were\r\nallowed to creep through the censorship, that by the third week of\r\nMarch he had at his disposal in Southern Manchuria a force of about\r\n50,000 men, the bulk of which was concentrated at Liao-Yang, some forty\r\nor fifty miles below Mukden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the Yalu]\r\n\r\nAt the same time a smaller body of troops held the Yalu River, and\r\npatrols were sent southwards. As early as February 28th, one of these\r\npatrols, consisting of three Cossacks under the command of Lieutenant\r\nLonchakoff, came into touch with a Japanese patrol outside Ping-Yang.\r\nThe Japanese retreated, and the Russians, after advancing within 700\r\npaces of the town, retired also before the sharp fire directed upon\r\nthem from the walls. This was the first land skirmish of the war; it\r\nwas a small affair of outposts only; and a long interval was to elapse\r\nbefore a more serious conflict could become possible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Round Niuchwang]\r\n\r\nImportant, however, as were the events occurring in Korea, it was felt\r\nby experts in Europe that the most momentous developments on land were\r\ndestined to take place on the western shore of the Liao-tung Peninsula,\r\nand that the advance upon the Yalu was really intended to cover a blow\r\nat a spot more vital to Russia's power. But here, by the nature of\r\nthings, the movements of the Japanese could not be so rapid. As already\r\nindicated, the ice-bound condition of the Liao-tung coast prevented any\r\nlanding operations in that quarter before the end of March or the\r\nbeginning of April, when the frozen belt usually begins to break up. As\r\nsoon as the advancing spring brought about the changed state of affairs\r\nit was apparent that a descent in force would become practicable to the\r\nJapanese both at Kinchau in Society Bay, where the peninsula narrows\r\ndown to a mere neck of land, and, more important still, at Niuchwang,\r\nthe treaty port at the north of the gulf. At either of these spots it\r\nwould be comparatively easy to cut the Manchurian railway and sever\r\ncommunication between Port Arthur and the Russian headquarters, but the\r\nseizure of Niuchwang would be of much greater consequence than that of\r\nKinchau, as it would place the invading army within easy striking\r\ndistance of Mukden itself. Furthermore, the very process of the break\r\nup of the ice at Niuchwang, as long as it lasts, is favorable in some\r\nrespects to the landing of an army. In winter the river is frozen out\r\nto sea for a considerable distance, and thus, when the spring arrives,\r\nthe estuary presents the appearance of several square miles of moving\r\nice-floes, tossed hither and thither by the swift and devious currents,\r\nand rendering the task of laying mines for the defence of the port\r\npractically impossible. Another advantage possessed by the Japanese in\r\nattacking from this quarter lay in the physical character of the\r\ncountry and in the friendliness of its inhabitants. The boggy nature of\r\nthe land threatened to deprive the Russian cavalry of half its\r\nusefulness, while it was eminently suited for the movements of\r\ninfantry, in which Japan found her greatest strength; on the other\r\nhand, the Japanese had made themselves very popular with the\r\ninhabitants during their war with China, and could depend upon the\r\nnatives for ample supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CZAR.]\r\n[Illustration: THE MIKADO.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Martial Law Proclaimed]\r\n\r\nThe extreme probability on all these grounds of a Japanese descent upon\r\nNiuchwang was doubtless evident to the Russians themselves, for they\r\nmade great exertions to put the port into a state of defence, and their\r\nconcentration at Liao-Yang, fifty miles or so to the north, was clearly\r\ndesigned to meet danger from this quarter. Niuchwang itself, however,\r\nis not very easily defended against a strong force attacking from the\r\nsea. The forts are of little avail against the guns of powerful\r\nmen-of-war; and therefore, although General Kondrotovitch, the able\r\nofficer in command, had done his best to strengthen the defences of the\r\ntown, and was said to have some twenty or thirty thousand troops at his\r\ndisposal by the end of March, it seemed clear that this was a vitally\r\nweak spot in Russia's extended front. On Monday, March 28th, the\r\nRussian authorities at Niuchwang declared martial law in this \"neutral\r\nport\" in the following terms:\r\n\r\nAccording to an order issued by the Viceroy of his Imperial Majesty in\r\nthe Far East, the Port of Ying-kow has been proclaimed under martial\r\nlaw. Until the publication of the order the following regulations will\r\nbe enforced, and will be brought into immediate operation:\r\n\r\n(1) Martial law extends over the town and port of Ying-kow, over the\r\nwhole population, without distinction of nationalities.\r\n\r\n(2) All passengers and cargoes arriving must undergo examination. For\r\nthis purpose steamers, sailing vessels and junks, having entered the\r\nmouth of the river, must anchor at a distance of six miles below the\r\nfort. A steam-launch, during daylight, with a naval and Customs officer\r\non board, will meet the vessels at that spot. They will examine the\r\nvessels and conduct them to berths allotted by the Customs officers.\r\n\r\n(3) The import of arms and ammunition is prohibited.\r\n\r\n(4) It is prohibited to export to any ports of Japan or Korea articles\r\nof military contraband.\r\n\r\n(5) When exporting articles to neutral ports the shipper must deposit\r\nwith the Customs security equal to the value of the cargo, as a\r\nguarantee that the cargo shall not be reshipped from a neutral port to\r\nJapanese or Korean ports.\r\n\r\n(6) Lightships and leading marks will temporarily cease to be used at\r\nthe mouth of the river.\r\n\r\n(7) When dealing with articles of contraband of war, the regulations\r\nsanctioned by his Majesty on February 14th, 1904, are to serve for the\r\nguidance of the military and civil authorities of the town and port of\r\nYing-kow, who must be guided by the published regulations defending the\r\nadministration of the provinces.\r\n\r\n(8) If beans and beancake are exported, a sum equal to twice their\r\nvalue must be deposited with the Customs.\r\n\r\n                                                 (Signed) VICTOR GROSSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  Firing on the Unarmed--Snowstorms and Bitter Frost--Reconnoitring\r\n    at Vladivostock--At the Mouth of the Golden Horn--Careful\r\n    Japanese Calculation--Bombardment at Long Range--Russian Ships\r\n    Lying Low--Makaroff to the Rescue--A Chance for Russian\r\n    Torpedoes--Sea Fight at Close Quarters--Severe\r\n    Casualties--Another Hot Fight--Unprecedented Japanese\r\n    Daring--Carnage Indescribable--Makaroff Outpaced--A Useless\r\n    Prize--Bombardment by Wireless Telegraphy--Port Arthur a\r\n    Hell--Golden Hill Silenced--Terrific Missiles--A Vivid\r\n    Picture--Blood, Blood Everywhere--Further Naval\r\n    Movements--Hoist with its own Petard--Another Attempt to\r\n    \"Bottle\"--Makaroff's Feint--Wary Enemies--Russians Taking\r\n    Heart--Individual Heroism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Firing on the Unarmed]\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the naval operations; but before dealing with the\r\nproceedings of Admiral Togo's fleet off Port Arthur, it will be well\r\nperhaps briefly to follow the fortunes of the Russian cruiser squadron\r\nstationed at Vladivostock, of which so much had been expected as an\r\nagency for the destruction of Japanese commerce on the high seas. The\r\nfirst news received of these cruisers after the outbreak of war did\r\nindeed appear to bear out the hopes which the Russians had entertained\r\nof them in this respect; but after one solitary exploit--the sinking of\r\na Japanese merchantman--the squadron disappeared from view altogether,\r\nand for several weeks its movements became one of the most remarkable\r\nmysteries of a mysterious situation. It will be remembered that the\r\nvessels composing the squadron were the powerful first-class cruisers,\r\nthe _Gromoboi_, the _Bogatyr_, the _Rossia_, and the _Rurik_, and the\r\nwhole was under the command of Captain Reitzenstein, formerly the\r\ncommander of the _Askold_. Apparently the orders given to the Commodore\r\nwere to cruise about the coast of Manchuria and Japan with the object\r\nof picking off stray merchantmen belonging to the enemy, and it was\r\nwhile he was acting in pursuance of these instructions that Captain\r\nReitzenstein, on February 11th, fell in with two Japanese steamers--the\r\n_Nakonoura Maru_ and the _Zensko Maru_, off the Tsugaru Straits, which\r\nlie between the islands of Hondo--the Japanese mainland--and Yezo. The\r\nlarger of the two, the _Nakonoura Maru_, was an old ship, built in\r\n1865, and of 1,084 tons burden; the smaller, the _Zensko Maru_, of only\r\n319 tons, was quite modern, having been built in 1895. They were bound\r\nin company from Sokata, in the province of Nizan, to Otaru, in Yezo.\r\nThe older and slower boat fell an easy prey to the Russian cruisers;\r\nbut it would seem that she offered fight, for she was surrounded by the\r\nmen-of-war, bombarded, and sunk, her crew being taken on board the\r\nRussian ships. This act called forth a great outburst of indignation in\r\nJapan and also in the United States; for though, of course, a\r\nmerchantman can justifiably be captured as a prize of war, it is not\r\nusual to destroy an unarmed ship out of hand. The official telegrams,\r\nhowever, gave no particulars as to the extent of the resistance\r\noffered, and it must be allowed that if the _Nakonoura Maru_ absolutely\r\nrefused to surrender, the Russian men-of-war would have no option but\r\nto fire upon her and let her take the inevitable consequences. The\r\n_Zensko Maru_, more fortunate than her consort, showed the Russians a\r\nclear pair of heels and escaped safely to the shelter of the port of\r\nFukuyama, in Yezo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Snowstorms and Bitter Frost]\r\n\r\nThis insignificant feat of arms was the sole success in the way of the\r\ndestruction of commerce which could be put to the credit of Captain\r\nReitzenstein's squadron in the early days of the war, and the fates\r\nsoon proved unkind to him. The stormy weather which inconvenienced the\r\nMikado's fleet off Port Arthur raged in the Japan Sea with peculiar\r\nseverity, and for three days after the destruction of the _Nakonoura\r\nMaru_ the Russian squadron flew before a heavy gale, aggravated by\r\nsnowstorms and bitter frost. An official message from Admiral Alexeieff\r\nreporting these facts was the last authentic news of the Vladivostock\r\nsquadron that reached the outside world for many weeks. Rumor upon the\r\nsubject was, of course, busy in Russia. Now it was reported that the\r\nactivity of Captain Reitzenstein had reduced the over-sea trade of\r\nJapan to a standstill; now it was stated (on the best authority, of\r\ncourse) that the squadron had escaped, and evading the Mikado's ships\r\nin some marvelous fashion, had joined the Russian fleet at Port Arthur;\r\nstill a third and wilder story made out that it was on its way to\r\nEurope to effect a junction with the Baltic fleet, which, it was\r\ndeclared, was to be dispatched to the Far East in July. The truth\r\nappears to have been that after infinite trouble and hardship Captain\r\nReitzenstein managed once more to make Vladivostock, and that his\r\nstorm-tossed ships took refuge again in the harbor, into which a free\r\npassage was maintained by the efforts of the ice-breakers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconnoitring at Vladivostock]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Commanders, however, were ignorant of the whereabouts of\r\nthis dangerous force, and a strong squadron was therefore sent into\r\nJapan Sea to search it out, and, if possible, destroy it altogether.\r\nThe fleet dispatched for this purpose consisted of one battleship and\r\nsix cruisers, with a torpedo-destroyer flotilla. The cruisers, it\r\nshould be observed, included the newly-acquired _Nisshin_ and _Kasaga_,\r\nwhich had just been fitted up for war. Rear-Admiral Kamimura, Admiral\r\nTogo's second in command at Port Arthur, had direction of the\r\noperations, no word of which was allowed at the time to leak out\r\nthrough the ordinary channels. A careful patrol was made of the whole\r\nof the coast, both of Manchuria and Japan, several days of this close\r\nsearch finally bringing the Japanese squadron to the very mouth of\r\nVladivostock Harbor itself. Considerable excitement was caused in\r\nRussia's northern stronghold when, at 8.50 on the morning of March 6th,\r\nwithout any previous warning of the approaching danger, the garrison\r\nperceived the hulls of seven great vessels loom upon the horizon to the\r\nsouth of Askold Island. The presence of the enemy so far north was\r\nwholly unexpected, and for some time the real character of the\r\nadvancing squadron was in doubt. But within an hour all speculation was\r\nset at rest and the approaching vessels were seen to be flying the\r\nJapanese flag. The great size and imposing aspect of the new cruisers\r\nled the Russians to take them for battleships, whence they derived the\r\nmistaken idea that Admiral Togo was present himself with his main\r\nfleet. As a matter of fact, of course, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief,\r\nwith scarcely diminished forces, was still watching Port Arthur as a\r\ncat watches a mouse, and the circumstance that he could without\r\ndifficulty spare so powerful a squadron for operations in a far distant\r\nquarter of the theatre of war was at once a striking demonstration of\r\nJapan's naval strength and of the straits to which the Czar's fleet had\r\nbeen reduced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At the Mouth of the Golden Horn]\r\n\r\nBy noon Admiral Kamimura's ships were half-way between the coast and\r\nAskold Island, making straight for Ussuri Bay, which lies to the\r\nsoutheast of Vladivostock. At the southern end of the peninsula on\r\nwhich the town and fortress of Vladivostock stand, and divided from it\r\nby a broad channel called the Bosphorus Strait, there is situated the\r\nIsland of Kazakavitch. The Bosphorus Strait lies in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, and on the north side of it are two spacious inlets,\r\nPatroclus Bay and Sobol Bay. Beyond these again lies the mouth of the\r\nGolden Horn, the Harbor of Vladivostock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Careful Japanese Calculation]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese squadron steamed right on into the Bosphorus Strait, and\r\nwhen opposite Patroclus Bay it assumed order of battle. Admiral\r\nAlexeieff, in his official dispatch to the Czar, declared that it took\r\nup a position 5-1/2 miles from the shore and out of range of the\r\nbatteries; but the truth seems to be that, with the skill which so far\r\nhas characterized all the Japanese naval operations, Admiral Kamimura\r\nmanoeuvred to secure a station, which, while it was sufficiently\r\nwithin range to enable him to do execution to his foe, was, on the\r\nother hand, outside any possible line of fire from the fortress guns,\r\nwith their necessarily limited arc of training. These dispositions for\r\nattack argued not only careful calculation beforehand, but considerable\r\nknowledge of the construction of the Russian forts and of the position\r\noccupied by their ordnance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment at Long Range]\r\n\r\nAt half-past one the Japanese ships opened fire with their big guns.\r\nForts Suvaroff and Linievitch and the town along the valley of the\r\nRiver Obyasseniye were the main objects of the cannonade, and over\r\nthese the great shells continued to burst for close upon an hour, while\r\nthe guns of the defenders were reduced to inactivity and impotence by\r\nthe baffling tactics of the Japanese Admiral. It is true that the\r\nbombardment was rather in the nature of a reconnaissance than a serious\r\nengagement, its aim being to induce the mysterious cruisers which were\r\nsuspected of being within the harbor to issue forth and give battle;\r\nbut it was an uncomfortable reminder to the Russians of the\r\nvulnerability of their powerful fortress from the sea and of the\r\ncomparative immunity which a resourceful enemy might enjoy while making\r\na dangerous attack. The only account which has been received of the\r\ndamage done comes from Russian sources. It does not appear to have been\r\nserious. A house in the town was knocked to pieces by a 12-inch shell,\r\nand an unfortunate woman, who was inside at the time, was killed;\r\nanother shell burst in the courtyard of the Siberian Fleet Company,\r\nslightly wounding five sailors; but this was set down as the limit to\r\nthe depredation committed by the Japanese gunners. On the other hand,\r\nthe Russians consoled themselves for the ineffectiveness of their own\r\nartillery by calculating that the bombardment, by its expenditure of\r\n200 shells, cost their enemy at least $100,000, a somewhat minute and\r\npeddling method of reckoning up the balance of losses and gains in a\r\ngreat war. It should be added that the Czar did not fail to send the\r\ngarrison a rather magniloquent telegram of congratulation, in which he\r\nspoke of their bravery under their baptism of fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAID BY THE VLADIVOSTOCK FLEET.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Ships Lying Low]\r\n\r\nThe demonstration failed to disclose the whereabouts of the missing\r\ncruiser squadron, and a similar result attended the scouting operations\r\nof the Japanese torpedo destroyers which were engaged during the\r\nbombardment in searching Askold Island and the coast along the Ussuri\r\nGulf. It seemed undoubted, however, in the light of subsequent events,\r\nthat the Czar's ships were within the harbor at Vladivostock all the\r\ntime, and that they felt unable to cope successfully with the powerful\r\nfleet which was so eagerly seeking their destruction. Admiral Kamimura,\r\nwho retired southwards after the bombardment, returned on the following\r\nday to the same position, and attempted once more to lure the hidden\r\ncruisers into the open; but his blandishments were without avail. He\r\nthen conducted a thorough search of Amur Bay, which lies on the west\r\nside of the peninsula, and finding no traces of the enemy, departed\r\nfinally southwards, leaving Vladivostock, for the time, in peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Makaroff to the Rescue]\r\n\r\nThe interest now shifted once more to Port Arthur, where exciting\r\nevents were on the eve of occurring. Admiral Makaroff, the\r\nnewly-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, arrived at\r\nPort Arthur on the 8th of March. This gallant Admiral's reputation\r\nstands almost as high with the navy as does General Kuropatkin's with\r\nthe army. He has gained the confidence of the men who have served under\r\nhim to an exceptional degree, and the immediate result of his presence\r\nat the seat of war was the infusion of a new spirit into the fleet and\r\ninto the defending force generally. With immense vigor he proceeded to\r\nhurry on the repairs of the damaged warships and to prepare for active\r\noperations as the best means of restoring the somewhat shaken _morale_\r\nof the force under his command. The effect of this bolder and more\r\nenterprising policy soon became evident in the movements of the torpedo\r\nflotilla, which, under the feeble régime of Admiral Starck, had proved\r\nsuch a futile branch of the service. An opportunity for the trial of\r\nthe new tactics came almost immediately, for within twenty-four hours\r\nafter the hoisting of Admiral Makaroff's flag on the _Askold_, a\r\nrenewed challenge came from the unresting enemy. It was destined to\r\nlead to one of the fiercest and most sanguinary combats yet experienced\r\nin the course of the war, a combat of such a close and hand-to-hand\r\ncharacter as to recall the desperate struggles of earlier days, when\r\nthe rival ships were grappled together and the final arbiters of\r\nvictory were the cutlass and the boarding-pike.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Chance for Russian Torpedoes]\r\n\r\nAt midnight on the 9th two divisions of the Japanese destroyer flotilla\r\ncrept up once more towards the mouth of the entrance channel. The first\r\ndivision, consisting of three vessels, the _Asashio_, the _Kasumi_, and\r\nthe _Akatsuki_, and under the command of Captain Asai, posted itself\r\noutside the entrance to guard against the approach of the Russian\r\nflotilla; while the second division occupied itself in laying a number\r\nof mines of a new pattern in various spots carefully selected\r\nbeforehand for the purpose. These operations were carried out with\r\nentire coolness and success, in spite of the flashing searchlights and\r\nthe fire from the forts--fire, however, which, according to Admiral\r\nTogo's official report, was desultory and ineffective. The fact was\r\nthat on this occasion the Russians were determined to rely upon another\r\nweapon than garrison ordnance. Admiral Makaroff decided to give his\r\ntorpedo destroyers the chance for which they must have longed under the\r\nnerveless leadership of Starck, and to send them forth to deliver a\r\ncounter-attack upon the audacious foe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sea Fight at Close Quarters]\r\n\r\nA flotilla of six of these vessels, under the command of Captain\r\nMatoussevitch, accordingly issued from the harbor and went in quest of\r\nthe Japanese. About 4.30 in the morning they fell in with Captain\r\nAsai's Division to the southwest of the Liau-tie-shan Peninsula. Though\r\nhis foes outnumbered him by two to one, the Japanese commander did not\r\nhesitate for an instant, but, confident in the skill and courage of his\r\nmen, he ordered an immediate attack, and the _Asashio_, the _Kasumi_,\r\nand the _Akatsuki_ flew upon the enemy. A fierce struggle now ensued.\r\nThe Japanese were heavily outnumbered, it is true, but their vessels\r\nwere stronger individually than those of the Russians, and whereas the\r\nlatter were armed only with 3-pounders, the former carried 6-pounders.\r\nMoreover, both officers and men had \"found themselves\" in previous\r\nconflicts, and were flushed with a consciousness of power and the\r\nmemory of past victories. Their shooting, too was superior to that of\r\ntheir opponents, and speedily made its impression. On the other hand,\r\nthe Russians, set free at last from the paralyzing influences which had\r\nso long cramped their energies, leapt to the contest with a glad\r\neagerness, and fought with desperate gallantry. The combatants drew\r\ncloser and closer to one another till they were within a few yards'\r\ndistance, and the execution done by the quick-firing guns was terrible.\r\nSo near did one of the Russian destroyers approach that some\r\nbluejackets standing on its deck were able to throw by hand a charge of\r\nexplosive onto the bridge of a Japanese boat. Fortunately for the\r\nlatter, it failed to explode, and the Japanese poured in a withering\r\nfire in revenge. Two of the Russian vessels were so severely mauled\r\nduring the early part of the fight that they were compelled to sheer\r\noff and retreat to Port Arthur. The others kept up the conflict much\r\nlonger, though they were hopelessly outclassed. But a perfect rain of\r\nshell and small shot fell upon the devoted Muscovites; their engines\r\nwere rapidly becoming disabled; some of them were on fire; and at last\r\nit became manifest that if they were to be saved at all they must\r\nretire. Retreat, therefore, they did, fighting hotly all the way, with\r\nthe enemy hanging upon their flanks like hounds upon their quarry. At\r\nlength they came within the protection of the forts, and the heavy fire\r\nwhich was directed upon the Japanese from that quarter compelled them\r\nsullenly to give up their hold and in their turn retire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Severe Casualties]\r\n\r\nThe losses suffered by the Russian destroyers, in this hand-to-hand\r\nconflict, which lasted for about forty minutes, were not made public\r\nofficially, but they must have been considerable, if we may judge from\r\nthe damage incurred by their victorious assailants. Seven of the\r\nJapanese were killed and eight were wounded, some of them severely.\r\nProminent among these was Engineer Minamisawa, of the _Kasumi_, who\r\npeculiarly distinguished himself, and who received injuries which were\r\nreported as likely to prove mortal. This gallant officer had already\r\ncovered himself with glory in the first torpedo attack upon Port\r\nArthur, and in the heroic but fruitless attempt to block the harbor\r\nentrance on the 23rd of February. The damage done to the Japanese\r\ndestroyers themselves was serious enough, but not such as to unfit them\r\nfor service in a few days. The _Akatsuki_ received a shell in her\r\nstokehold, which burst a pipe and filled the compartment with scalding\r\nsteam--an accident which alone accounted for four of the lives which\r\nwere lost. All three destroyers had their hulls and upper works knocked\r\nabout by the Russian shells, but the injuries were above the\r\nwater-line, and were made good with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another Hot Fight]\r\n\r\nAn even hotter and, for the Russians, more disastrous conflict took\r\nplace a few hours later. As the second division of the Japanese\r\nflotilla, under Captain Tsuehiya, was leaving the roadstead at 7 A.\r\nM., having concluded its work of laying submarine mines, it\r\nencountered two other Russian destroyers which had been further out\r\nto sea to reconnoitre, and were now returning to Port Arthur. The\r\nJapanese at once threw themselves across the course of the newcomers\r\nto intercept them. The Russians, though on this occasion the\r\noutnumbered party, were nothing loth to face the danger which\r\nconfronted them, and advanced to meet it with unquenchable ardor. An\r\nengagement of an even more terrible character than that held three\r\nhours previously now took place, and lasted for upwards of fifty-five\r\nminutes. The Russians fought with the courage of despair, and\r\nsucceeded in putting one of their formidable opponents out of action\r\nfor the time, though the damage done was not ultimately irreparable.\r\nThis feat was performed by the _Stereguschtshi_, commanded by Captain\r\nSergueieff, which was more heavily armed than her companion, and\r\ncarried a 12-pounder in addition to her ordinary 3-pounders. A shell\r\nfrom this weapon struck the Japanese destroyer on the water-line and\r\nflooded two of her water-tight compartments. The supply of\r\nquick-firing ammunition was wetted and rendered useless, so that the\r\nvessel was unable to take any further active share in the conflict.\r\nNor was this the only injury she sustained. Another shell burst upon\r\nher bridge, shivering it to fragments. One man was killed; but a\r\nlieutenant, a sub-lieutenant, and a signaller, who were on the bridge\r\nat the time, in some miraculous manner escaped. The terrible missile\r\nalso carried away the binnacle and the engine-room telegraph\r\ninstruments, and sent the davits flying.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unprecedented Japanese Daring]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the 12-pounder of the _Stereguschtshi_ was too\r\ndangerous a weapon to be neglected, and, therefore, the other Japanese\r\ndestroyers concentrated their fire upon it, with the result that in a\r\nshort time it was completely dismantled and put out of action. In these\r\noperations the _Sazanami_ played the most conspicuous part. She drew up\r\nso close upon the _Stereguschtshi's_ quarter that one of her\r\nbluejackets with extraordinary daring actually leaped on board the\r\nRussian vessel, cutlass in hand. Just as he landed on the deck Captain\r\nSergueieff emerged from his cabin. The impetuous Jap rushed at him like\r\na tiger, and, beating down his guard, struck him a fearful blow on the\r\nhead with his cutlass, felling him to the deck. The Russian attempted\r\nto rise, but before he could do so his terrible opponent kicked him\r\noverboard and he sank beneath the waves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carnage Indescribable]\r\n\r\nUndismayed by the death of their captain, the crew of the\r\n_Stereguschtshi_ still fought on with desperate gallantry against the\r\nraking fire of the _Sazanami_. The lieutenant took over the command,\r\nbut immediately afterwards a shell carried away both his legs, and he\r\nfell dead at his post. To him succeeded the sub-lieutenant, who\r\nendeavored bravely but in vain to bring the little vessel, wounded\r\nalmost to the death as it was, into the shelter of the forts. He almost\r\nsucceeded in his heroic attempt, but the implacable foe was not to be\r\nshaken off. The man at the wheel fell mortally wounded, and as the\r\nyoung lieutenant stepped forward to take it from his dying grasp he\r\nbecame himself the target of the terrible fusillade and dropped dead\r\namong his fallen brothers. Now at last, with hardly a man out of her\r\ncrew of fifty-five still living, the _Stereguschtshi_ lay a helpless\r\nlog upon the waters, awaiting the long-deferred capture, but the fire\r\nfrom the forts rendered the task of taking her in tow an extremely\r\ndangerous one. Nevertheless, a Japanese lieutenant and a party of\r\nbluejackets from the _Sazanami_ boarded her with a rope and made her\r\nfast. The deck of the Russian destroyer presented a horrible spectacle.\r\nEverywhere lay the corpses of her gallant crew, in some cases terribly\r\nmutilated by shell. Even in the few hurried moments at his disposal the\r\nJapanese lieutenant was able to count thirty bodies; the appearance of\r\nthe stokehold defied description. Two stokers jumped overboard, and\r\nwere picked up by the Japanese. The only other survivors were two\r\nsailors, who, directly the enemy boarded the vessel, rushed out of the\r\nconning tower, and, taking refuge in the after cabin, locked themselves\r\nin and refused absolutely to surrender.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Makaroff Outpaced]\r\n\r\nNow began the slow and laborious work of towing the captured boat out\r\nof range of the shore batteries, whose attentions were becoming\r\nembarrassing and dangerous. Moreover, a new peril threatened the\r\nJapanese. Admiral Makaroff, perceiving the plight of the\r\n_Stereguschtshi_, had hoisted his flag on the _Novik_, and sallied\r\nforth with that cruiser and the _Bayan_, to the rescue. The other\r\ndestroyer, it should be mentioned, thanks to the diversion caused by\r\nthe heroic stand made by her consort, had in the meantime managed to\r\nreach the harbor. Things began to look black for the _Sazanami_, as the\r\nRussian cruisers were rapidly approaching; but Admiral Togo was not to\r\nbe caught napping, and his own cruiser squadron was not far away.\r\nSeveral of his ships advanced to the assistance of the plucky little\r\ndestroyer, and finding himself outnumbered and outpaced, Makaroff\r\nreluctantly abandoned his attempt and steamed back to the protection of\r\nthe forts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Useless Prize]\r\n\r\nThe _Sazanami_, however, was not destined to save her prize. The sea\r\nwas rough, and the Russian destroyer, riddled with holes, steadily\r\nbegan to fill with water. After two hours' towing it became apparent\r\nthat her condition was desperate, and the Japanese were compelled to\r\ncut the rope. A few moments afterwards the hapless prize gave one last\r\nlurch and sank beneath the waves with her tragic freight of dead. It\r\nwas impossible to reach the two men in the cabin, and they perished\r\nwith their ship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment by Wireless Telegraphy]\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the hottest conflicts yet experienced in the course\r\nof the naval fighting around Port Arthur. But this sanguinary affair\r\nwas only the prelude to more important operations. Admiral Togo had\r\nmade his arrangement for a bombardment of the town and fortress of the\r\nheaviest description, arrangements which, like the manoeuvres of\r\nAdmiral Kamimura at Vladivostock, were conceived in the spirit of the\r\nmost scientific warfare. As long as the Russian fleet remained\r\nundestroyed he was under an imperative necessity to risk his ships as\r\nlittle as possible against the great guns of the Port Arthur batteries,\r\nbut to conduct a successful bombardment without coming within the range\r\nof their fire presented obvious difficulties. An indirect cannonade\r\nfrom Pigeon Bay, on the southwest side of the Liau-tie-shan Peninsula,\r\nwould indeed deprive the enemy of any opportunity of replying with\r\neffect, but on the other hand in ordinary circumstances the gunners of\r\nthe attacking fleet would also have to aim very much at random, without\r\nbeing able to judge the results of their shooting. Nevertheless this\r\ndifficulty was cleverly obviated by the Japanese Admiral. While\r\nstationing his battleships in Pigeon Bay he dispatched his cruiser\r\nsquadron to take a position on the east side of Port Arthur Bay, at\r\nright angles to the line of fire, to observe the effects of the\r\nbombardment, and to communicate suggestions by wireless telegraphy\r\nduring its progress. The post of the cruisers in turn was adroitly\r\nselected so that while they could see what was going on, they were\r\noutside the angle of fire of the forts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOKIO MILITARY HOSPITAL--OFFICERS QUARTERS.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Arthur a Hell]\r\n\r\nThese careful dispositions were completed by ten o'clock on the morning\r\nof the 10th, and at that hour once more \"the red fire and smouldering\r\nclouds out brake.\" For close upon five hours a storm of shells was\r\npoured upon the devoted fortress. The defending guns attempted to\r\nreturn the fire, but their efforts were intermittent and ineffective.\r\nOn the other hand, the great projectiles from the 12-inch guns of the\r\nJapanese battleships wrought immense havoc both in the forts and in the\r\ntown. A shell burst close to the house of a lawyer named Sidorski, and\r\nwrecked the building; M. Sidorski himself was killed on the spot. The\r\nwife of Colonel Baron Frank, who was in the house at the time,\r\nsustained terrible injuries, and her daughter's head was blown off. A\r\nyoung lady named Waleritsch was so seriously wounded by another shell\r\nthat she died soon after her removal to the hospital. An English\r\nadvocate, a Mr. Newton, was blown to pieces. The house of General\r\nVolkoff was completely destroyed, and two sentries only just escaped\r\ndeath. A train which was entering the town from the North was struck by\r\na 12-inch shell; the engine was shattered into a thousand fragments and\r\nthe driver was killed. And now to add to the horrors of the situation,\r\nfires began to break out in various quarters of the town, and the\r\npanic-stricken inhabitants fled to the race course, where, behind the\r\nshelter of the hills, they were able to find some respite from the\r\nterrible tornado which had burst upon them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Golden Hill Silenced]\r\n\r\nWhile all this devastation was being hurled upon the town, the forts\r\nthemselves were passing through a hot time. The Japanese, assisted by\r\nthe skilful manoeuvre before described, had found the range for their\r\nhigh angle fire perfectly, whereas the batteries of the defending force\r\ncould do little or nothing in return. The official accounts issued from\r\nthe Russian side, while admitting the severity when the bombardment\r\nvisited the town, said little about the damage to the fortifications or\r\nthe losses sustained by the garrison; but the reports received from\r\nother and independent sources, while varying a good deal in details,\r\nagreed in representing the total result as being of the most serious\r\ncharacter. It is said that twenty soldiers were killed and that many\r\nmore were wounded. The Governor of Port Arthur himself, General\r\nStoessel, who was on the batteries during the hottest of the fire, had\r\na narrow escape. A shell burst near to the spot on which he was\r\nstanding with his staff, and bespattered the whole party with splinters\r\nand sand. The forts on Golden Hill suffered severely, and two guns were\r\nput out of action. Nor did the ships in the harbor come off scatheless.\r\nHeavy casualties among their crews were reported, and it was stated\r\nthat the unfortunate _Retvisan_, which had already borne so much,\r\nreceived still further damage.\r\n\r\nThe Port Arthur journal, the _Novi Krai_, gave a terrible picture of\r\nthe scenes on the cruiser _Bayan_.\r\n\r\n\"The bursting shells,\" said the writer, \"bowled over man after man\r\nuntil the decks were slippery with blood. Amidst this hell the captain\r\nstood unmoved in the conning tower calmly telephoning his orders to the\r\ncaptains of the guns. His wonderful coolness had a remarkable influence\r\non all the officers. The cockpit was soon crowded with wounded,\r\nthirty-nine men being brought down before the fight ended.\r\n\r\n\"Amid the crash of the guns, the hiss of the flying projectiles, and\r\nthe thunder of their explosions, the smashing of splinters, and the din\r\nof the working engines, the surgeons labored quietly among the wounded\r\non the hospital operating table. Although some of the men suffered\r\nfrightful agony, few groans were heard, in spite of the fact that\r\nanæsthetics were only administered in one case.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH PLAN OF PORT ARTHUR'S MAIN FORTIFICATIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrific Missiles]\r\n\r\nFor hours that to the heart-shaken inhabitants must have appeared\r\ninterminable, the great shells, each of the enormous weight of 850\r\nlbs., continued to hurtle through the air and to burst over the\r\nharassed stronghold. The sensations of a garrison in such circumstances\r\nare well described in a letter which a wounded Russian officer wrote\r\nfrom the hospital in Port Arthur to a friend in Russia. He is\r\nrecounting his experiences of the first bombardment, but the account is\r\nso vivid and would apply so well to the more trying ordeal of the 10th\r\nof March that it will bear reproduction here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Vivid Picture]\r\n\r\n\"The sea,\" he says, \"is quite white from the falling shells, and it is\r\nimpossible to hear the words of command. I cry out until my voice\r\nbecomes hoarse, but cannot make myself heard above the din. There are\r\nmore than 150 cannon belching forth smoke, shell and death. There is a\r\nwild, choking sound from the machine guns. Amid the smoke, steam and\r\ndust I hear a groan, it is that of a soldier whose nose has been torn\r\naway by the fragment of a shell. He is surrounded by stretcher bearers.\r\nSomeone lays his hand on my shoulder, and I turn and see at my side a\r\nsoldier, pale, and his lips trembling. He wishes to speak, but his\r\ntongue refuses to obey. He points with his finger, and I understand\r\nwhat has occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNERAL PROCESSION OF A JAPANESE OFFICER IN YOKOHAMA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blood--Blood Everywhere]\r\n\r\n\"There beneath the cliff I hear a little battery of rapid firing guns,\r\nvery small and elegant. There are 12,000 bullets speeding on their\r\nerrand in sixty seconds. They are destined to defend our shores against\r\nthe landing of an enemy. The orgy is at its height. The shells are\r\nbursting around us like fireworks at a feast. A whistle, a hiss, and a\r\nsharp ringing noise, as they rush through the air, then smoke and a\r\nsmell of burning, while the sand dances from the earth. I turn from the\r\nbattery and see a terrible picture. In the midst of the men a shell\r\nbursts. One soldier is disemboweled, and another is wounded in the\r\nhead, a third is shrieking in the height of his delirium. One steel\r\ncannon is broken to pieces as though it were straw. An awful picture,\r\nwith blood--blood everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further Naval Movements]\r\n\r\nAt last, at two o'clock, the inferno ceased. A great calm succeeded to\r\nthe thunder of the guns and the screams of the shells, and the\r\ncivilians of Port Arthur slowly and timidly returned to their ruined\r\nhomes. The separate divisions of the Japanese fleet rejoined one\r\nanother, and after the most destructive bombardment yet inflicted upon\r\nthe land defences of the Russian stronghold, they quietly steamed away\r\nsouthwards. While these events were taking place at Port Arthur a\r\ndetached squadron of the Mikado's cruisers had proceeded northeast to\r\nDalny, or Talienwan, as it used to be called, and destroyed the\r\nquarantine buildings erected by the Russians on the Sanshan Islands.\r\nOutside that port the _Takasago_ and the _Chihaya_ scouted the western\r\ncoast of the entrance to Port Arthur in the hope that the bombardment\r\nwould draw Admiral Makaroff's ships into the open; but no enemy could\r\nbe found and the two cruisers then retired in the wake of the main\r\nsquadron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hoist With its Own Petard]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before a Russian vessel fell a victim to the mines laid\r\nby the Japanese destroyers at the harbor entrance on the night of March\r\n9th. On the 16th the _Skori_, a torpedo-boat destroyer of the newest\r\npattern, was entering the channel when she struck upon a contact mine\r\nand was blown up. Out of her crew of fifty-five men, only four were\r\nreported to have been saved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another Attempt to Bottle]\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of twelve days Admiral Togo made a renewed attack\r\nupon Port Arthur, the fifth in number since the outbreak of\r\nhostilities. It was not so serious an assault as the last, its real\r\nobject being to tempt the Russian fleet away from the protection of the\r\nshore batteries and to give battle at sea. In this design it was\r\nunsuccessful, but incidently it was useful, as revealing the strength\r\nof the squadron Admiral Makaroff had at his disposal after the repairs\r\nwhich had been effected upon the damaged ships. At midnight on the 21st\r\ntwo Japanese destroyers were discovered by the searchlights approaching\r\nthe outer roadstead. The guns of the batteries at once gave tongue, and\r\na violent fire was directed against the daring craft, not only from the\r\nfortress but from the gunboats _Bobe_ and _Otvagni_; which, according\r\nto Admiral Alexeieff's report to the Czar, compelled them to retire. A\r\nsecond flotilla crept up at 4 o'clock in the morning, and this too, it\r\nwas claimed by the Viceroy, was repulsed. A different complexion,\r\nhowever, was put upon the operation by Admiral Togo's dispatch to his\r\nGovernment. The destroyers retired indeed, but seemingly not in\r\nconsequence of the Russian fire, which left them unharmed, but as part\r\nof a preconceived plan to lure forth Admiral Makaroff's fleet. The\r\nJapanese Commander-in-Chief's words were: \"The combined fleet acted\r\naccording to program. Two flotillas of our destroyers were outside Port\r\nArthur, as instructed, from the night of the 21st till the morning of\r\nthe 22nd. Although during this time they were under the enemy's fire\r\nthey did not sustain any damage.\" It is clear from this that the aim of\r\nthe Russian gunners leaves much to be desired, for the attacking\r\nflotilla were able to cruise about in the roadsteads without being\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Makaroff's Feint]\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock on the morning of the 22nd the main fleet arrived off\r\nPort Arthur. The same tactics as were employed on the 10th were adopted\r\non this occasion, but with some modification. Only two battleships, the\r\n_Fuji_ and the _Yashima_, were sent to Pigeon Bay to undertake an\r\nindirect bombardment of the town; while the Admiral, with his main\r\nsquadron, took up a position more convenient for an attack upon the\r\nRussian fleet should it put out to sea. The cannonade lasted again for\r\nseveral hours, but his main purpose, that of drawing Admiral Makaroff\r\ninto the open, was not successful. At one period, indeed, the hopes of\r\nthe Japanese ran high. The Russian fleet was seen to issue from the\r\nharbor as if ready for battle, with the cruiser _Askold_, flying the\r\nflag of the Commander-in-Chief, at their head. It was now observed that\r\nthe available naval force of the Czar at Port Arthur consisted of five\r\nbattleships and four cruisers, as well as destroyers, gunboats, and\r\ntorpedo-boats. The battleships of course included the _Pobieda_, 12,674\r\ntons, and the _Sevastopol_, 10,950 tons, which were undergoing repairs\r\nwhen the first battle took place. None of the five, it will be\r\nremembered, was equal to the Japanese battleships, either in size or in\r\narmament, and the cruiser strength was still more disproportionate.\r\nNevertheless, they made a gallant show, and for a time it seemed as if\r\nthey were prepared to come to close quarters on blue water. Admiral\r\nMakaroff, however, bold and enterprising as he is, did not feel in a\r\nposition to take such a strong step, and, to the disappointment of the\r\nJapanese, he kept his ships well within the zone of protection afforded\r\nby the shore batteries, while he joined them in returning the fire of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wary Enemies]\r\n\r\nThe objects of the two Admirals were indeed identical. Each sought to\r\nbring about a battle on his own terms, and each was too wary to be\r\npersuaded. The Russian attempted to lure his enemy within the range of\r\nthe forts; the Japanese endeavored to draw the Russian away from the\r\nrange of the forts; and neither was successful in his blandishments.\r\nFinally, Admiral Togo gave the order to cease firing, and his fleet\r\nretired southwards once more. The Russians claimed to have struck one\r\nof their opponent's battleships; but Admiral Togo in his report\r\ndistinctly stated that his ships suffered no damage, though a good many\r\nshells fell near the _Fuji_ in the course of the indirect bombardment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians Taking Heart]\r\n\r\nAlthough Admiral Makaroff did not venture out to sea with his smaller\r\nsquadron when the Japanese fleet was absolutely upon the spot, this did\r\nnot prevent him from engaging in active operations of a much more\r\ndaring character than any his predecessor had dreamt of. On the 26th,\r\nfor example, he took out the whole of the ships under his command for a\r\nreconnaissance to the Hwang-Ching-Tau Islands, a group situated about\r\nthirty miles to the southwest of Port Arthur, a proceeding that must\r\nhave heartened both officers and men considerably. No trace of the\r\nenemy's warships was discovered, but while the fleet was making its way\r\nback to Port Arthur, the _Novik_ fell in with a small merchant steamer,\r\nthe _Hanien Maru_, on board of which were a number of Japanese\r\nnewspaper correspondents. The crew were transferred to the warship and\r\nthe steamer was taken in tow and subsequently sunk. The whole Russian\r\nsquadron returned safely to Port Arthur after this excursion without\r\nonce coming in sight of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SKIRMISH BETWEEN JAPANESE AND RUSSIAN CAVALRY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Individual Heroism]\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime the Japanese were busy with fresh plans. Unable to\r\ndraw Admiral Makaroff away from the protection of the forts when the\r\nwhole Japanese fleet was lying in wait, Admiral Togo determined to use\r\nanother card in this game of skill. The project of corking up the\r\nbottle at Port Arthur, though a failure on the first attempt, had not\r\nby any means been abandoned, and on the very night of Admiral\r\nMakaroff's cruise to the Hwang-Ching-Tau Islands, a fresh effort was\r\nmade to block the harbor entrance. It resulted in operations which,\r\nalthough again only partially successful, were most brilliantly\r\nexecuted, and were marked not only by consummate skill, but by acts of\r\nindividual heroism and self-sacrifice of the most inspiring kind. Nor\r\nwas the gallantry confined to one side alone. The Russians were not\r\nslow to accept the opportunities for glory vouchsafed to them by the\r\ndaring of their foe, and one of the features of the conflict was the\r\nattack by a solitary torpedo-boat upon six of the Japanese flotilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  Volunteers for Fireships--A Drama of Searchlights--The Devil's\r\n    Caldron--The Sacrifice of Fire--Heroic Hirose--Undaunted by\r\n    Death--Covering Themselves with Glory--Casualties Few but\r\n    Terrible--The Hero of Japan--Channel Still Unclosed--The\r\n    Shadows of Fate--The Great Catastrophe--The Story of the\r\n    \"Petropavlovsk\"--A Double Trap--Captain Oda and his Mines--The\r\n    \"Bayan\" to the Rescue--Preparing an Ambush--Makaroff Lured\r\n    Out--Cutting off the Unwary--Weather Permitting--Into the Jaws\r\n    of Death--Haphazard Fire--Rescue Work--The Character of the\r\n    Explosion--Accounts of Survivors--Tribute from the Japanese--On\r\n    Land--Chong-Ju--The Advance to the North--Concentration of\r\n    Troops--Kuroki's Line of Front--The Russian Position--Russian\r\n    Confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Volunteers for Fireships]\r\n\r\nAs on the occasion of the first effort to block the harbor at Port\r\nArthur, so upon the second a spirited competition took place among the\r\nJapanese officers and men for the honor of occupying the post of danger\r\nupon the fireships. The claim of the gallant men who had charge of the\r\nprevious attempt to finish the work which they had so well begun was\r\nfinally conceded, their Commander-in-Chief himself deciding the\r\nquestion. Four merchantmen, larger than those already sunk, had been\r\nfilled with stones and explosives and were ready for the desperate\r\nenterprise. The whole fleet left the rendezvous on the 26th of March\r\nunder the cover of night, and accompanied the fireships up to a\r\ndistance of some miles from Port Arthur. There the Admiral gave his\r\nfinal orders, and escorted by a flotilla of eleven destroyers and six\r\ntorpedo-boats, which were spread out fanwise in front of them, the\r\ndoomed vessels started upon their last and proudest voyage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Drama of Searchlights]\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when they set forth, and there was no moon. An inky\r\ndarkness brooded over the waters, which lay still and calm like a\r\nvillage pond. No sound was heard, no light was shown on the flotilla\r\nas, steadily and inexorably, it pursued its fateful passage over the\r\nsilent sea. The only ray of light visible came from the distant\r\nsearchlight on Golden Hill, set like the eye of a Cyclops, in the\r\nforehead of Port Arthur. Slowly and monotonously the broad refulgent\r\nbeam swept backwards across the bay, throwing into strong relief every\r\nobject upon which it fell within a radius of more than two miles. Every\r\nmoment it seemed to the tense expectancy of the advancing force that\r\ntheir presence must be revealed, but still they held on their course\r\nwith calm and patient courage, and still the slow minutes dragged along\r\nwithout any sign of suspicion on the part of the garrison. At last,\r\nwhen the Japanese had approached so near that they could make out the\r\ndim contour of the fortress and the surrounding heights, the moving\r\nlight settled for a moment upon the lines of the foremost\r\ntorpedo-boats. Another instant and a startling change had come over the\r\nscene. Swiftly the searchlight flashed up and down, backwards and\r\nforwards it plunged and replunged upon the stealthy foe until the whole\r\nflotilla, approaching with such grim determination, lay exposed to the\r\nview of the Russian sentries. The trumpets rang out, the garrison\r\nsprang to arms, and a storm of shot and shell once more burst forth\r\nfrom the great guns of Golden Hill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Devil's Caldron]\r\n\r\nAs the gallant Japanese made straight for the harbor entrance the\r\nbatteries on the Tiger's Tail joined in the fierce cannonade, and from\r\nmore than a hundred guns a hail of shells was poured down, till the\r\nstill waters of the bay were torn up into a maelstrom of foam, \"white\r\nas the bitten lip of hate.\" But the calm resolution of the attacking\r\nforce was undisturbed. The fan-like formation of the escorting flotilla\r\nopened out more widely, and the fireships, passing swiftly through,\r\ndrove straight into the devil's caldron in front of them. A mile away\r\nstood the point for which they aimed, a mile charged every yard of it\r\nwith destruction and death. But setting their teeth dauntlessly, intent\r\nonly on gaining the fateful goal, the picked crews of the merchantmen\r\npressed forward upon their desperate errand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sacrifice of Fire]\r\n\r\nAt last they reached the harbor mouth. The leading steamer, the _Chiyo\r\nMaru_, drove straight from the east side of the channel, heedless of\r\nthe terrible fire of which she was the central target. Everything was\r\nready; the anchor was dropped; the fuse was set; and swiftly but with\r\nprecision the crew slipped into the boats and made off. A moment later\r\na terrific explosion rent the ship from stem to stern, and down she\r\nsank through the boiling waters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heroic Hirose]\r\n\r\nThe next to take her position was the _Fukui Maru_, which, edging to\r\nthe port side of the _Chiyo Maru_, let go her anchor. Now occurred one\r\nof the most heroic acts which had yet characterized the course of the\r\nwar--an act which for cool and devoted gallantry has never been\r\nsurpassed in the annals of European seamanship. Waiting until the\r\nvessel was securely anchored, the boatswain, Sujino, went calmly down\r\nto the magazine to light the fuse. Just at that moment the Russian\r\ntorpedo-boat _Silni_ approached and discharged a Whitehead torpedo,\r\nwhich struck the _Fukui Maru_ full in the bows and tore a gaping hole\r\nin her below the water-line. Sujino was killed, but his comrades on\r\ndeck were unaware of his fate. All they knew was that the Russians\r\nthemselves had done their work for them and that the vessel was\r\nsettling down on the very spot designed for its destruction by Admiral\r\nTogo. Commander Hirose, therefore, ordered his men to take to the\r\nboats, but before he left the ship himself he determined to find the\r\nbrave Sujino if possible and save him from death. The steamer was fast\r\nsinking; the water was pouring in at her bows like a mill race; and she\r\nwas the target of a perfect tornado of fire from the forts; but the\r\ngallant commander searched through her three times for the missing man\r\nbefore he would give up the quest. At last it became clear that further\r\nsearch was useless. The vessel was on the point of going down, and\r\nreluctantly Hirose clambered into one of the boats. As the crew pushed\r\noff the _Fukui Maru_ went down by the head. Success, however, was\r\ndearly purchased. The delay had enabled the Russians to concentrate\r\ntheir fire upon the boats with deadly effect. The chief victim himself\r\nwas Commander Hirose. A shell struck him on the head, carrying away the\r\ngreater part of his body, and leaving in the boat only a shapeless\r\nfragment of torn and blackened flesh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undaunted by Death]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the other steamers were taking up their stations in\r\nthe order provided beforehand. The _Yihiko Maru_, regardless of the\r\nterrible fire from the forts, steamed in on the port side of the _Fukui\r\nMaru_ and cast anchor in her turn. The fuse was duly set and lighted;\r\nofficers and crew set off in the boats; and the ship blew up like her\r\nfellows and sank in the channel. Now came the opportunity of the fourth\r\nand last of this devoted fleet, the _Yoneyama Maru_. The difficulties\r\nof the channel and the violence of the enemy's fire led her to take a\r\ndevious course, but the skill with which she was steered excited\r\nuniversal admiration. Her commander drove her through on the starboard\r\nside of the sunken _Chiyo Maru_ and then she was compelled to turn back\r\nand slip between that ship and the _Fukui Maru_. On her way she ran\r\nright upon a Russian destroyer and engaged it at close quarters for a\r\nfew moments, but her duty was not to fight but to sink at a spot\r\nselected. Escaping therefore, from the clutches of the enemy, she\r\nrounded the _Fukui Maru_ and the _Yahiko Maru_ and finally brought up\r\nin the very centre of the fairway. There her crew prepared to send her\r\nto the bottom, and if the operation could have been carried out\r\nsuccessfully there can be little doubt that the whole enterprise would\r\nhave gained its object, and that the channel would, at least\r\ntemporarily, have been completely blocked. But the Russian\r\ntorpedo-boats were active. One of their deadly engines of destruction\r\nstruck the _Yoneyama Maru_ just as the crew were about to cast anchor,\r\nand she drifted somewhat to the westward before she sank, her bow\r\npointing towards the Tiger's Tail. Her crew escaped safely, but this\r\naccident left too wide a space between the _Yoneyama Maru_ and the\r\n_Yahiko Maru_ to effect a total obstruction of the channel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Covering Themselves With Glory]\r\n\r\nAll this time the torpedo-boat and destroyer flotilla had been far from\r\nidle. The destroyers consisted of the _Shirakumo_, _Kasumi_, _Asashio_,\r\n_Akatsuki_, _Akebono_, _Oboro_, _Inayuma_, _Ikadsuchi_, _Usugomo_,\r\n_Sayanami_, and _Shinonome_, while the torpedo-boats were the\r\nfollowing: the _Karigane_, _Aotaka_, _Misasagi_, _Tsubame_, _Managuru_,\r\nand _Hato_. Several of these, it will be remembered, had already\r\ncovered themselves with glory in previous combats. On this occasion\r\nthey fully maintained their high reputation. The hot cannonade which\r\nwas directed from the fortress upon the fireships so far from deterring\r\nthe escorting vessels acted rather as an attraction to them, for while\r\none division of the flotilla stood by the doomed steamers in order to\r\npick up their crews, the other approached well within range of the\r\ngarrison artillery in order to divert its fire from the main operation\r\nwhich was proceeding in the channel. Here it was that the _Silni_,\r\nunder Lieutenant Krinizki, came into contact with the Japanese\r\ntorpedo-boats. Without a moment's hesitation that gallant commander\r\nengaged the whole six at once. The unequal combat could not be long\r\nmaintained, but it was fierce while it lasted. Lieutenant Krinizki\r\nhimself was wounded, Engineer Artificer Swyereff and six seamen were\r\nkilled and twelve other men were wounded. But still, the remainder\r\nfought gallantry on till a shell burst one of the little vessel's steam\r\npipes and destroyed her steering-gear. Her power to continue in action\r\nwas gone, and she was beached upon the shore below Golden Hill.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Japanese expeditions was now done. The survivors of the\r\nfireships were by this time all picked up and the several vessels of\r\nthe flotilla were concentrated and retired out to sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Casualties Few But Terrible]\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable operation the Japanese lost in all four killed and\r\nnine wounded. Of these latter Lieutenant Hatsuzo sustained very severe\r\ninjuries; the wounds of the others, including Lieutenant Masaki and\r\nEngineer Awada, being of a slighter character. In the circumstances it\r\nwas surprising that the casualties were so few, and one more\r\nillustration was given of the comparative impunity with which torpedo\r\nattacks can be made in harbor under cover of night. The smallness,\r\nhowever, of the Japanese losses in this species of fighting in the\r\npresent war, must, of course, be largely attributable to bad shooting\r\non the part of the Russian gunners, and it would be unwise to draw too\r\ngeneral a lesson from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESOLATION IN MANCHURIA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hero of Japan]\r\n\r\nThe most severe loss sustained by the Japanese was that of the gallant\r\nCommander Hirose, whose death, while it inflamed his comrades with\r\npride, caused universal mourning. He had only recently been promoted\r\nfor the skill and courage which he had displayed in the previous\r\nattempt to block the harbor. He was then in command of the _Hokoku\r\nMaru_, and regardless of the appalling fire directed upon her, he\r\nmanaged to rush his ship further than any of her companions up the\r\nchannel before he blew her up and sent her to the bottom. An act of\r\nparticularly cool, almost reckless, daring on his part on that occasion\r\nwas now fondly recalled by his men. The ship was sinking, she was the\r\ntarget of all the Russian batteries, and the crew had taken refuge in\r\nthe boats; but Commander Hirose had forgotten something. It was nothing\r\nless important than his sword, which he had left on the bridge. So, in\r\nspite of the imminent peril of the situation, he coolly went back to\r\nrecover it, buckled it on, and escaped into the boat just in time, for\r\nthe ship went down a moment afterwards. Commander Hirose was well known\r\nin naval circles in England, for he was a visitor to those shores a few\r\nyears before on business for the Japanese Admiralty, and had made many\r\nfriends. His remains were conveyed to Japan and accorded a public\r\nfuneral, and the Mikado only expressed the feelings of the whole nation\r\nwhen he posthumously conferred upon the fallen hero the Order of the\r\nKite and the Order of the Rising Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Channel Still Unclosed]\r\n\r\nThe exact amount of obstruction caused in the channel by the sinking of\r\nthe fireships could not be ascertained. It is, however, apparent from\r\nsubsequent events that whatever inconvenience to navigation, temporary\r\nor permanent, may have resulted, it was not sufficient to prevent the\r\npassage of Admiral Makaroff's ships. At daybreak on the very morning of\r\nthe attack he led his whole fleet out and lined it up in the roadstead\r\nin readiness to meet the Japanese fleet, which was in sight ten miles\r\nout at sea. Seeing, however, that his enemy had no intention of coming\r\noutside the range of the forts, Admiral Togo was not to be tempted\r\nnearer, and retired with the whole of his force to the southward. For\r\nseveral days he did not give any outward signs of activity, and his\r\nships were not sighted off Port Arthur, a fact which gave rise to the\r\nimpression that he was engaged in covering the transport of fresh\r\nJapanese troops to the west coast of Korea. On the other hand, the\r\nvigilance of Admiral Makaroff showed no indication of abating. On the\r\n6th of April the steamer _Haimun_, specially chartered for the service\r\nof the London _Times_, was overhauled by the cruiser _Bayan_ an at a\r\ndistance of thirty-five miles to the southeast of Port Arthur. A shot\r\nfired across the _Haimun's_ bows brought her to, and two lieutenants\r\nput off with a boat's crew and boarded her. The greatest politeness was\r\nshown, and after an examination of the _Haimun's_ papers she was\r\nallowed to proceed. The _Times'_ correspondent was able to observe that\r\nthe _Bayan_, which was flying the flag of the Admiral himself, showed\r\nsigns of injuries received in the recent fighting. Marks produced by\r\nsplinters of shell were visible all over her, and a large hole had been\r\nrent in one of her smoke-stacks. This fact seems to bear out the story\r\npublished in the _Port Arthur Journal_ of the destruction wrought upon\r\nthe _Bayan_ by the high-angle fire of the Japanese in the bombardment\r\nof the 10th of March. The correspondent added that the officers and men\r\nwho boarded his steamer \"were a little fine drawn, but nevertheless\r\nlooked good material.\" Some indication can be gathered from this\r\nstatement of the strain which Admiral Togo's repeated attacks had\r\ninvolved upon his opponents. The constant anxiety had necessarily begun\r\nto tell upon the defending force, and many more than the officers and\r\ncrew of the _Bayan_ must have acquired that gaunt, tense appearance\r\nthat comes from a sense of ever-impending danger heightened by a past\r\nexperience of tragedy and disaster. No better illustration, indeed, of\r\nthe watchfulness entailed on the Russians by the perpetual menace of\r\ntheir foe could be given than the case of Admiral Makaroff himself, who\r\nsent the following telegram to the President of the War Relief Society\r\nat Kronstadt on March 29th:--\r\n\r\n\"Last night was a very hot one, but we cannot hope for a very quiet\r\ntime now or in the near future. I sleep without undressing in order\r\nthat I maybe ready for any emergency. Consequently, I cannot observe\r\nyour medical advice to take care of myself; nevertheless, I feel\r\nsplendid.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Shadows of Fate]\r\n\r\nThese words were destined soon to receive a fulfilment more\r\nheart-shaking than any that can have presented itself as possible to\r\nthe mind either of the writer of the letter or of its recipient. For\r\neven then stern Fate was standing ready with the abhorred shears; the\r\nshadows were gathering round the head of the devoted Makaroff; and his\r\nweary watch, pursued so bravely, so unflinchingly, and, alas for him\r\nand his country, so unavailingly, was moving swiftly towards its tragic\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Catastrophe]\r\n\r\nFor on April 13th the telegraph wires flashed all over the world the\r\nnews of a blow to Russia's might in the Far East, more appallingly\r\ndramatic in its suddenness and more fatal in its consequences than any\r\nthat had yet befallen her in the preceding two months of bungling and\r\nmisfortune. The stunning intelligence was conveyed to the Czar in the\r\nfollowing telegram from Rear-Admiral Grigorovitch, Naval Commandant at\r\nPort Arthur:--\r\n\r\n\"The battleship _Petropavlovsk_ struck a mine, which exploded and the\r\nvessel capsized.\r\n\r\n\"Our squadron is lying under Golden Hill and the Japanese squadron is\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\"Admiral Makaroff apparently perished with the _Petropavlovsk_.\r\n\r\n\"The Grand Duke Cyril, who was saved, was slightly wounded.\r\n\r\n\"I beg humbly to report to your Majesty that those saved from the\r\n_Petropavlovsk_ up to the present are Grand Duke Cyril, six officers,\r\n32 sailors, all wounded. The bodies of four officers, a surgeon, and 12\r\nsailors have been found.\r\n\r\n\"The Japanese fleet has disappeared. Details will be supplied by\r\nRear-Admiral Prince Ukhtomsky, who has assumed provisional command of\r\nthe fleet.\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly upon the track of this first message there followed the brief\r\naccount of a further disaster, which placed another of Russia's finest\r\nbattleships _hors de combat_. Prince Ukhtomsky telegraphed that \"during\r\nsome manoeuvring of the battleship squadron, the _Pobieda_ was struck\r\nby a mine amidships on the starboard side. She was able to gain the\r\nport by herself and none on board were killed or wounded.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOWING UP OF THE PETROPAVLOVSK.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Story of the \"Petropavlovsk\"]\r\n\r\nThe news of this fearful _debacle_ created a paralyzing effect in\r\nofficial circles at St. Petersburg, and spread consternation among\r\nRussia's sympathizers throughout Europe. The first brief reports left\r\nroom for speculation as to the cause of the disaster, and an accident\r\nwas conjectured such as that which had destroyed the _Yenesei_; but the\r\nlater accounts and the dispatches of Admiral Togo to his Government\r\nspeedily put the real facts beyond doubt. It then became known to the\r\nworld that Admiral Makaroff had fallen a victim to the deeply-laid\r\nplans of his brilliant adversary, and, moreover, that the whole Russian\r\nfleet had only narrowly escaped capture or complete destruction. The\r\nstory of the operations which practically gave the _coup de grace_ to\r\nthe Czar's maritime power in the Far East is a remarkable one. It shows\r\nwhat a revolutionary effect the discoveries of modern science have had\r\nupon naval warfare, and it proves, too, how completely the lessons of\r\nthat science have been assimilated by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of April Admiral Makaroff, still pursuing his policy of\r\nactivity, took the whole of his effective squadron out to sea, for a\r\ndistance of six miles to the south of Port Arthur and exercised it in\r\nmanoeuvres. No sign of the enemy was perceived, and the fleet\r\nreturned to the harbor in safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Double Trap]\r\n\r\nBut Admiral Togo was not far away. Despairing of ordinary means of\r\ntempting Admiral Makaroff into the open to meet his more powerful\r\nfleet, he was preparing a double trap in which to catch his wary foe.\r\nHe hoped, by the display of a markedly inferior force, to entice him\r\nbeyond the range of the forts and then rush in with his battleships and\r\ncapture or destroy the whole of the Russian fleet. But in the event of\r\nfailure in this manoeuvre, he had ready another scheme. The course\r\ntaken by the Russian ships on leaving and returning to the harbor on\r\nthe occasion of the frequent excursions which they had made of late had\r\nbeen carefully noted by the Japanese officers, and Togo had determined\r\nto mine the passage extensively, so that even if the enemy eluded a\r\ndecisive battle at sea, he still hoped to do damage to their ships by\r\ndriving them in the hurry and confusion of a headlong flight upon the\r\nhidden perils of his mine field. As it turned out, this part of his\r\nplan succeeded, and the result was probably even more startlingly\r\neffective than he expected; but it was only by a mere chance, as\r\nalready mentioned, that the other and grander portion of his scheme\r\nfailed of realization. If he had managed to interpose his powerful\r\nfleet between the Russian Squadron and Port Arthur, there can be little\r\ndoubt that, although he himself would probably have sustained some\r\nsevere losses, the Czar's naval force in the Pacific, already weakened\r\nby its former disasters, would have been practically eliminated. As it\r\nwas, indeed, the success he attained was sufficiently striking. By it\r\nhe secured the decisive supremacy of the sea in the Gulf of Pechili,\r\nand rendered possible at last the important movements on land which the\r\nstrategists at Tokio were waiting to initiate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captain Oda and His Mines]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the Japanese were carried out with their usual\r\nthoroughness. At midnight on the 12th of April, the fourth and fifth\r\ndestroyer flotillas and the fourteenth torpedo flotilla reached Port\r\nArthur roadstead, having with them under escort the mining ship, the\r\n_Koryo Maru_. The _Koryo Maru_ was a new vessel of 2,700 tons burden,\r\nspecially constructed for torpedo and mining work. Captain Oda, the\r\nofficer in command, was one of the ablest experts in this branch of\r\nwarfare in the Japanese navy, and he had only recently been decorated\r\nfor his distinguished services. He had invented a new type of mine of a\r\nparticularly deadly description, and it was now to be tried for the\r\nfirst time in actual warlike operations. The work of laying the mines\r\nwas entered upon without delay, and with all the customary daring and\r\nresource exhibited by the Mikado's sailors in this dangerous class of\r\nservice. Notwithstanding the relentless glare of the searchlights,\r\nwhich threw the vessel into strong relief and made her the target for\r\ntwo hundred guns, Captain Oda and his men calmly went about their work\r\nunheeding. The torpedo-boats and destroyers in the meantime took up a\r\nposition on the flanks of the _Koryo_ and endeavored to attract the\r\nfire of the fortress to themselves, while their escort was doing her\r\ndeadly work unsuspected. The enterprise was aided by a renewal of the\r\nextraordinary feebleness and lack of skill which had so often been\r\ncharacteristic of the Russian defense in the past. Not only were the\r\ngarrison gunners unable to hit the mark so plainly presented to them,\r\nbut the torpedo flotilla, which, despite its recent losses, still\r\nconstituted a formidable force, did nothing to interfere with\r\noperations which threatened so vitally the safety of the fleet. Even\r\nAdmiral Makaroff seems to have been at fault on this occasion. It is\r\nalmost inconceivable that the true nature of the _Koryo's_ proceedings\r\nwas not guessed by him, and that the most active measures were not\r\ntaken to put a stop to them. Whatever may have been the reason,\r\nhowever, nothing effective was done, and Captain Oda was able to\r\ncomplete his work unharmed in spite of the shells which were churning\r\nup the water all round him. It must be remembered, nevertheless, that\r\nthe immunity which the _Koryo_ actually enjoyed is no measure of the\r\nrisk that she ran. No more heroic and devoted act illumines the long\r\nhistory of naval warfare than the laying of these mines close to the\r\nharbor, and under the full fire of the enemy's guns, any one of whose\r\nmissiles, by exploding the dangerous cargo, might have sent the ship to\r\ndestruction in a moment. But, as it turned out, the _Koryo_ was saved\r\nby the bad gunnery of the Russians, and having performed his duty well\r\nand thoroughly, Captain Oda withdrew to the open sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Bayan\" to the Rescue]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the torpedo-boats and destroyers, besides distracting\r\nthe attention of the defending force from the work of the mine\r\ntransport, were engaged in more active operations on their own account.\r\nAt dawn the second division fell in with one of the enemy's destroyers,\r\nthe _Strashni_, which was creeping stealthily towards the harbor mouth\r\nfrom the direction of Dalny. The Japanese were on her track in a\r\nmoment, and, cutting off her retreat, bombarded her with their\r\n6-pounders, until in a few minutes she became a total wreck and sank.\r\nAn attempt was made to save her crew, but the work of rescue was\r\ninterrupted by the appearance on the scene of the Russian cruiser\r\n_Bayan_. Admiral Togo's destroyers sheered off upon the approach of\r\nthis formidable adversary, and left to her the task of picking up the\r\ndrowning men, but the _Bayan_ was too late to be of much service, and\r\nonly five men could be recovered. At about the same time as this\r\nincident, a second Russian destroyer was encountered by the Japanese\r\ncoming from the direction of Liau-tie-shan. A strong effort was made to\r\ncapture her, but she was more fortunate than the _Strashni_, and\r\nmanaged to escape to Port Arthur in safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparing an Ambush]\r\n\r\nBut now began the larger and more important operations which were\r\ndestined to end so disastrously for Admiral Marakoff and his fleet.\r\nAdmiral Togo had ordered a weak squadron, consisting of the first-class\r\ncruisers _Tokiwa_ and _Asama_ and four second-class cruisers, to act as\r\na support to the destroyers, if attacked, and at the same time to serve\r\nas a lure to the Russians, and tempt them away from the protection of\r\nPort Arthur. He, himself, with his main fleet, lay in hiding thirty\r\nmiles away to the southeast, waiting for an opportunity to dash in and\r\ncut off Makaroff's retreat. The day was not unsuitable for such an\r\nenterprise. Rain was falling, and a mist hung heavy over the sea,\r\ndisguising the smoke of his great warships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL OF A DISPATCH FOR GENERAL KUROPATKIN.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Makaroff Lured Out]\r\n\r\nBy eight o'clock on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese cruiser\r\nsquadron appeared on the offing and engaged in a long-range fire with\r\nthe _Bayan_, which had not returned to the harbor. Admiral Makaroff,\r\nseeing the smallness of the force opposed to him, gave the order to his\r\nfleet to steam out in column formation and attack the venturesome\r\nenemy. Hoisting his flag on the _Petropavlovsk_, the Russian\r\nCommander-in-Chief led the way himself, followed by the battleships\r\n_Poltava_ and _Pobieda_, the cruisers _Diana_, _Askold_, and _Novik_,\r\nand the destroyer flotilla. In the roadstead the fleet was joined by\r\nthe _Bayan_, and the whole force then set forth majestically to engage\r\nthe Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cutting Off the Unwary]\r\n\r\nBut the orders of Admiral Togo were well observed by Admiral Dewa,\r\ncommander of the cruiser squadron. Gradually the Japanese began to\r\nretire before the superior force opposed to them, drawing Makaroff\r\nonwards, further and further out to sea. The Russian fleet began a hot\r\nfire at long range, to which the Japanese ships replied at intervals,\r\njust sufficiently to keep their opponents occupied and to lure them on\r\nto greater efforts by the display of a manifest disparity of strength.\r\nBy this skillful manoeuvring they succeeded in enticing Makaroff out\r\na distance of fifteen miles to the southeast of Port Arthur. Now was\r\nthe time to communicate with Admiral Togo. Wireless telegraphy flashed\r\nthe news of the success of the ruse to the Commander-in-Chief. His\r\ngreat battleships were waiting with steam up and cleared for action.\r\nDirectly he received the message from the retreating squadron he\r\nsignalled to the new cruisers, the _Nisshin_ and _Kasuga_, to join him,\r\nand then advanced at full speed with eight powerful vessels to cut off\r\nthe unwary Russians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weather Permitting]\r\n\r\nThe plan had been well laid and it seemed on the brink of success, but\r\nthat incalculable factor, the weather, intervened and brought Togo's\r\ncalculations to naught. The wind suddenly freshened, and, blowing away\r\nthe mist under cover of which the Japanese men-of-war were approaching,\r\ndisclosed the smoke of their funnels to Admiral Makaroff. In a flash he\r\nsaw the trap into which he had nearly led his fleet, and gave orders to\r\nretreat to Port Arthur with all haste. Back, therefore, the Russians\r\nscurried with the Japanese in full cry at their heels. Steam as they\r\nmight Togo's ships were too late to catch their enemy, and great must\r\nhave been the disappointment of the gallant Admiral and his men when\r\nthey saw the prey slip from their grasp. But the curtain had not yet\r\nfallen upon the drama. Makaroff's ships had emerged from Port Arthur\r\nand passed over the mine field in safety; by a singular stroke of luck\r\nthey had eluded the Japanese battle fleet, but they had still a third\r\ndanger to encounter--they had once more to pass over the deadly engines\r\nof war which Captain Oda had placed in their path. And here it was that\r\nthe blow fell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Into the Jaws of Death]\r\n\r\nBy about half-past nine the fleet, with the _Petropavlovsk_ at its head\r\nregained the roadstead and the protection of the fortress guns.\r\nSignalling to the torpedo flotilla to enter the harbor, Admiral\r\nMakaroff turned his own vessel towards the east and ordered the\r\ncruisers to follow him. The battleship _Pobieda_ was to the stern of\r\nthe _Petropavlovsk_, on the starboard quarter. Close behind her again\r\ncame the _Poltava_. The Commander-in-Chief was on the bridge of his\r\nship with the Grand Duke Cyril, son of the Grand Duke Vladmir, and\r\ncousin of the Czar; Captain Yakovleff, and some other officers.\r\nSuddenly the horrified spectators on shore saw a great white column of\r\nfoam rise on the right side of the _Petropavlovsk_. A dull report was\r\nheard, followed by another and more terrific explosion under the\r\nbridge. A huge thick cloud of greenish yellow smoke rose around the\r\ndoomed vessel, a topmast, a funnel, a turret and the bridge were hurled\r\ninto the air, and the huge monster heeled over on her starboard side.\r\nHer poop rose up, showing the propeller working in the air. Fire burst\r\nout in every part, and in a moment the ship was a mass of flame. A few\r\nseconds more and the whole fearful spectacle was torn from the eyes of\r\nthe paralyzed onlookers, for with a tremendous lurch the vessel turned\r\nfurther on her side, the waters rushed in upon her in torrents, and\r\nwith a roar and a hiss the mighty mass plunged beneath the foaming\r\nsurface of the sea. The _Petropavlovsk_ had gone to her death carrying\r\nwith her the gallant Admiral himself, his staff, and full six hundred\r\nofficers and men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Haphazard Fire]\r\n\r\nThis terrible catastrophe threw the whole squadron into the utmost\r\nconfusion. The other ships began a rapid haphazard fire in all\r\ndirections to destroy the mines which they knew lurked in every\r\ndirection, but their shots were purposeless; there was no mark at which\r\nto aim, and no effect was produced. And then, to carry further dismay\r\nto the already nerve-shaken fleet, a mine exploded on the starboard\r\nside of the _Pobieda_. She listed at once, but her fate was happier\r\nthan that of the _Petropavlovsk_. No second explosion followed; the\r\nwatertight bulkheads were shut to, and sorely wounded though she was\r\nshe managed to keep afloat and to crawl into the harbor with the\r\ncruisers crowding behind her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rescue Work]\r\n\r\nThe _Poltava_ in the meanwhile had remained upon the scene of the\r\ndisaster, and her boats put out to save any of the crew of the flagship\r\nwho could be found. In this work they were aided by the torpedo gunboat\r\n_Gaidamak_, and their combined efforts succeeded in rescuing the Grand\r\nDuke Cyril, seven officers, and seventy-three seamen. These were the\r\nonly survivors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Character of the Explosion]\r\n\r\nThe difference in the effect of the mine explosions upon the\r\n_Petropavlovsk_ and the _Pobieda_ was due to causes which could not\r\nhave been foreseen. The terrible character of the disaster which befell\r\nthe flagship was due to the fact that the mine exploded underneath her\r\nboilers, and that when these burst the explosion of the ammunition\r\nmagazine, which was in the same part of the ship, immediately followed.\r\nThe whole affair was over in less than a minute and a half. On the\r\nother hand, the explosion at the side of the _Pobieda_ did not touch\r\nthe boilers, and seriously--indeed for the purposes of immediate\r\nwarfare, irremediable--damaged as she was, the same appalling results\r\ndid not follow in her case as in the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accounts by Survivors]\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the survivors of the _Petropavlovsk_ all confirm this\r\nview. But so swift indeed was the tragedy that there was not much time\r\nor opportunity for the formation of correct conclusions upon this or\r\nupon any point. The narratives of the men who were picked up were of\r\nthe kind usually met with on the occasion of a sudden catastrophe. They\r\nwere mainly confined to their own personal experiences and miraculous\r\nescape. Upon the memories of some, however, certain outstanding\r\nincidents were sharply and indelibly photographed. One of the last\r\nthings which a signalman saw upon the bridge before he was hurled off\r\nwas the figure of an officer lying weltering in his blood. It was\r\nAdmiral Makaroff himself. Captain Yakovleff, the commander of the\r\nvessel, was hurled against a stanchion with such force that he was\r\nthought to be killed, but he was afterwards picked up alive. The Grand\r\nDuke Cyril had an escape just as marvelous. He, too, was knocked on the\r\nhead, but he was not rendered unconscious, and when he was thrown into\r\nthe sea he fell clear of the sinking vessel. He was an excellent\r\nswimmer, and in spite of the shock and injury he had sustained, he\r\nmanaged to keep afloat until he was picked up. Rear-Admiral Molas,\r\nMakaroff's chief of staff, was in his cabin when the explosion\r\noccurred, and was drowned. His body was one of the few that were\r\nafterwards washed ashore. Another picture which some of the survivors\r\nretained in their mind was that of \"an old man with a beautiful white\r\nbeard,\" who was standing on the deck just before the disaster with a\r\nbook in his hand sketching. This was the famous war artist,\r\nVerestchagin. Only that morning his friend Makaroff had invited him to\r\nshare the hospitality of the flagship and so gain further material for\r\nhis realistic pictures of the horrors of war!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tribute from the Japanese]\r\n\r\nThe full magnitude of the success which his plans had gained was not\r\nrevealed to the Japanese Admiral till the Russian dispatches made it\r\npublic to the world. He saw a vessel, as he phrased it, \"of the\r\n_Petropavlovsk_ type\" strike a mine and sink, and he thought also that\r\nanother ship--he was referring to the _Pobieda_--lost freedom of\r\nmovement; but he did not know that with the _Petropavlovsk_ perished\r\nthe brain of the Russian defence, a brain which, if it had been\r\nemployed from the first by its master, the Czar, might have given a\r\ntotally different character to the war. The death of Makaroff in itself\r\nbrought no rejoicing to the Japanese in their hour of victory, but only\r\nthat feeling of almost personal sorrow which brave and chivalrous men\r\nfeel for the death of a gallant foe. No finer or more generous tributes\r\nindeed could have been paid even in the western world than were paid to\r\nthe memory of the brave but unfortunate Makaroff by the members of this\r\nso-called yellow race.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On Land]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Admiral Togo once more brought his fleet before Port\r\nArthur, and by means of an indirect bombardment, silenced the new forts\r\non Liau-tie-shan. He then retired again to prepare for a further\r\nattempt to cork up the harbor, which should finally reduce the Russian\r\nfleet to a state of ineffectiveness, and leave the sea clear for the\r\ntransport of the great army which was to be launched against the\r\nLiao-tung Peninsula and southern Manchuria. Already General Kuroki,\r\nwith the First Army, was encamped on the south bank of the Yalu River\r\nprepared for an advance upon the Russian position at Khiu-lien-cheng.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chong-Ju]\r\n\r\nBut before dealing with the momentous events which now occurred in\r\nrapid succession, both on land and sea, it will be necessary to return\r\nfor a few moments to the earlier fortunes of the First Army, whose\r\nadvance through Korea as far as Ping-Yang was described in Chapter III.\r\nIt will be remembered that a small skirmish took place between Russian\r\nand Japanese patrols to the north of that town on February 28th. A\r\nmonth elapsed before the opposing forces came seriously into touch with\r\none another again. During that period General Kuroki slowly but\r\nsteadily continued his advance in the face of terrible difficulties\r\narising from the weather and the state of the roads. The mud on these\r\nnorth Korean highways in the spring makes them almost impassable, but\r\nthe Japanese had thought of everything, and brought large supplies of\r\nwood with which they practically relaid the road, and made it admit\r\neven of the passage of heavy artillery. The Cossack patrols retired\r\nbefore this persistent advance, and no real attempt to dispute it was\r\nmade till the vanguard of the Japanese neared Chong-ju, a little town\r\nabout thirty miles north of Anju and fifty south of Wiju. Here, on\r\nMarch 28th, they found six squadrons of Cossacks belonging to General\r\nMishtchenko's Brigade, posted on an adjacent hill, prepared to dispute\r\nthe forward movement. A brisk engagement ensued. The small force of\r\nJapanese which first appeared upon the scene, according to the\r\ntestimony of General Mishtchenko himself, gallantly held their ground\r\nin spite of the commanding position occupied by the Russians and the\r\nraking cross fire which they maintained, and it was only after half an\r\nhour of fierce fighting that they gave way and fell back upon their\r\nsupports which were hastening to the front. Reinforcements now rapidly\r\narrived, and the Russians, finding their position untenable, retired\r\nalong the road to the north, yielding up possession of the town to the\r\nJapanese. In this smart little affair the Russians, according to their\r\naccount, lost three killed and twelve wounded, the Japanese casualties\r\namounting to five killed, including one officer, and twelve wounded,\r\nincluding two officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Advance to the North]\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Chong-ju General Kuroki moved forward rapidly,\r\nfinding no resistance. On April 2nd he occupied Syoush-kou, a place\r\neighteen miles west of Chong-ju, and forty miles south of Wiju, and two\r\ndays afterwards his scouts entered Wiju itself, an important town on\r\nthe south bank of the Yalu. The Russians did not find themselves strong\r\nenough to oppose the Japanese advance in Korea, and determined instead\r\nto resist it on the north bank of the Yalu. General Kuroki therefore\r\noccupied Wiju without firing a shot, and set to work busily to\r\nconsolidate his forces for the great enterprise of crossing the Yalu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concentration of Troops]\r\n\r\nThe month of April was occupied by General Kuroki in the steady\r\nconcentration of his troops and in the collection of war material.\r\nPontoons were conveyed to the front in readiness for the operation of\r\nforcing the river; heavy guns were transported over the Korean roads\r\nwith, in the circumstances, really marvelous rapidity; and masses of\r\ncavalry and infantry arrived at Wiju every day. By the end of the month\r\nthe First Japanese Army had been brought up to its full strength,\r\namounting probably to between 60,000 and 70,000 men of all arms. It was\r\ndivided into three divisions, the 12th, the 2nd and the Guards. The\r\n12th Division, it will be remembered, was the first section of the army\r\nto put foot on Korean soil, being landed at Chemulpo during the first\r\ndays of the war, after the destruction of the _Varyag_ had left that\r\npart of the coast clear for the Japanese disembarkation. It may be well\r\nto record its composition exactly, as it is typical of all the Japanese\r\ndivisions. It was made up as follows:--Infantry, 12,000 (four regiments\r\nof three battalions each); cavalry, 500 (one regiment); artillery, 900\r\n(one regiment, 36 guns, two field batteries, two mountain batteries);\r\nengineers, 700; transport corps, 600; hospital corps, 700; ammunition\r\ncolumn, 500; post office corps, veterinary corps, pontoon corps and\r\nballoon corps, 1,000; total, 16,900. Attached to these combatant troops\r\nwere a force of 5,500 coolies for transport purposes, bringing the\r\ngrand total of the division, combatant and non-combatant, up to 22,400.\r\nThe whole was under the command of Lieutenant-General Inouye, whose\r\nchief subordinates were Major-Generals Kigoshi and Otani.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN CONCENTRATION ON THE YALU.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuroki's Line of Front]\r\n\r\nAs his army arrived at the front, General Kuroki began gradually to\r\noccupy a wider front on the south bank of the Yalu, his left wing\r\noperating at the mouth of the river in conjunction with a naval force\r\nunder the command of Admiral Hosoya, and his right extending to a\r\ndistance of twenty or twenty-five miles up the river, past Sukuchin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Position]\r\n\r\nWhile the Japanese were thus concentrating on the left bank of the Yalu\r\nthe Russians were gradually strengthening their positions on the right\r\nbank, the centre and key of which was formed by the village of\r\nKiu-lien-cheng. During all these weeks the greatest secrecy was\r\nobserved on both sides in regard to their numbers and dispositions--as\r\nfar, at least, as the outside world was concerned. It seems probable\r\nfrom after events that the Russians themselves were largely ignorant of\r\nthe strength of the force which General Kuroki had at his disposal;\r\nbut, on the other hand, that able commander appears to have been\r\nthoroughly well informed in every detail as to the position occupied by\r\nhis enemy. There was the greatest diversity of statement on the Russian\r\nside after the battle of the Yalu upon the question of the real\r\nintentions of General Kuropatkin in holding as he did the right bank of\r\nthe river. When the disastrous result of the conflict of May 1st became\r\nknown in Europe the friends of the Commander-in-Chief in the press\r\ndeclared that it was due to the failure of the officer in immediate\r\ncommand, General Sassulitch, to follow his instructions, which were to\r\noffer only a strategical resistance to the enemy and to withdraw slowly\r\nbefore the advance of a superior force upon Feng-haung-cheng, a\r\nposition about thirty miles distant upon the Liau-yang road. If this\r\nexplanation is correct, the activity shown by the Russians for weeks in\r\nconstructing earthworks on the heights around Kiu-lien-cheng is\r\nrendered very remarkable, and equally difficult to understand is the\r\nsize and importance of the force to which was apportioned the task of\r\nthus keeping in touch with the advancing Japanese army and conducting a\r\nmere strategic defeat. For General Sassulitch was commander of the 2nd\r\nSiberian Army Corps, and though the actual body of troops engaged in\r\nthe fighting-line in resisting the passage of the Yalu by the Japanese\r\ndid not amount to that strength, there is no doubt that General\r\nSassulitch had under him in the near neighborhood a force of not less\r\nthan 30,000 men. All the evidence, in fact, points to the conclusion\r\nthat the Russian Generals, including the Commander-in-Chief himself,\r\nwholly underestimated the fighting power of the Japanese and the skill\r\nwith which they would be led when the opposing armies came to close\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Confidence]\r\n\r\nThe kind of talk which responsible military men in St. Petersburg\r\nindulged in before the battle of the Yalu all goes to strengthen this\r\nimpression. On April 25th, the day before General Kuroki began that\r\nseries of movements which were to culminate in his crossing the Yalu\r\nand driving the Russians before him in headlong rout, there appeared in\r\nthe _Echo de Paris_ the report of an interview which its St. Petersburg\r\ncorrespondent had had with Colonel Vannovsky, of the Russian General\r\nStaff, and formerly military attache in Japan. The utterances of this\r\nsapient officer are amusing reading in view of what happened so shortly\r\nafterwards. He thought it would still be some time before serious\r\nmilitary operations could begin on the Yalu, for the Japanese, in his\r\nopinion, were far from having completed their concentration in Korea.\r\nThey probably, he said, had three divisions of from 12,000 to 15,000\r\nmen between Ping-Yang and the Yalu; and, including the Second Army then\r\ndisembarking, they had not more than 85,000 men near the front. Then\r\nfollowed a valuable criticism of General Kuroki and his colleague,\r\nGeneral Oku, the commander of the Second Army. Both, he reminded the\r\ninterviewer, served in the Chino-Japanese War; but \"he looked for\r\nnothing extraordinary from them, both were more than sixty years of\r\nage.\" On the whole, he thought that the Japanese would establish\r\nthemselves in Korea; if they crossed the Yalu it would be only to\r\nsatisfy public opinion at Tokio. Colonel Vannovsky soon had reason to\r\nbe sorry that he had spoken so disdainfully of General Kuroki, and with\r\nsuch sublime assurance of the Japanese plans. If the crossing of the\r\nYalu was mainly dictated by a desire to satisfy public opinion at\r\nTokio, it must be said that public opinion at Tokio had its wishes very\r\namply gratified before many days had expired. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat in the history of nearly every war the greatest disasters follow\r\nthe greatest self-confidence. And yet it can easily be understood how\r\nthe armies that had proved successful against those famous fighters the\r\nTurks in the war of the seventies should despise the little dwarfish\r\nJapanese, who had hitherto only faced the undisciplined hordes of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Kuroki Completes his Plans--The Scene of Battle--General\r\n    Sassulitch's Defences--The Russian Dispositions--The\r\n    Attacking Army--Clearing the Islands--Guards Half-way\r\n    Across--Parallel Movements--The Searching Japanese\r\n    Fire--Bridging the Yalu--Confusion in the Russian\r\n    Councils--Kuroki's Consummate Strategy--Futile Russian\r\n    Opposition--Masked Batteries at Work--Serpentine Line of\r\n    Dark Forms--Two Thousand Deadly Thunderbolts--Inferno Let\r\n    Loose--Howitzer High-Angle Fire--Co-operation of\r\n    Gunboats--Miserable Array of Russians--Four Miles of\r\n    Japanese--A Moment of Tense Expectancy--The General Attack\r\n    Begins--Ridges Alive with Flame--Surprise of the\r\n    Russians--The Plunge Across the Ai--Overwhelming\r\n    Legions--The Circling Ring of Fate--Devastating Artillery\r\n    Bombardment--Black Mass of Human Figures--The Blood-Red\r\n    Banner--Fight Desperately Against Fate--General\r\n    Sassulitch's Retreat--The Japanese Chase--The Last Gallant\r\n    Stand--Rifle Fire and Cold Steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuroki Completes his Plans]\r\n\r\nThe numerous small skirmishes between outposts which took place on the\r\nYalu and its tributaries during the earlier part of the month of April\r\nneed not detain us. They were mainly encounters between small\r\nreconnoitering parties, and though there were losses on both sides,\r\nfortune on the whole leaned in favor of the Japanese. The results of\r\nthese reconnaissances in locating the positions occupied by the\r\nRussians, combined with the success of the Japanese transport\r\narrangements, which, as stated already, placed an army of 60,000 to\r\n70,000 men at General Kuroki's disposal, enabled him to complete his\r\npreparations for the great task before him by the beginning of the last\r\nweek in April. The night of the 25th found him ready at all points, and\r\non the morrow his army entered upon the preliminary stages of a series\r\nof operations which, culminating in the crossing of the river and the\r\ncapture of the Russian position, first revealed to an astonished world\r\nthe hitherto undreamt-of potentialities of Japan as a military power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Scene of Battle]\r\n\r\nSome study of the map of the scene of battle is necessary for a perfect\r\nunderstanding of the movements of the contending forces. It will be\r\nseen on reference to our map (page 169) that just above Wiju the waters\r\nof the Yalu are joined from the northwest by an important tributary,\r\nthe Ai River, the stream here taking the form of a fork. At the apex of\r\nthe triangular wedge of land which divides the Ai from the Yalu is\r\nsituated the Hosan, or Tiger Hill, an important strategical position\r\ncommanding the south bank of the main river. Opposite Tiger Hill, and\r\nrunning some way past it up the Yalu, is the Island of Kulido, which\r\ndivides the river at this point into two streams, both of them\r\nfordable. The Ai also is fordable at a point near the hill of\r\nYulchasan, which is north of Tiger Hill and on the same bank of the\r\ntributary. Opposite Wiju itself the main river is two miles wide and is\r\ndivided into three streams by two islands. Of these the larger\r\nCheun-song-do, is near the right bank, and lies stretched alongside it\r\nfor a distance of about thirteen miles, starting from a spot close to\r\nAntung, lower down the river, and finishing at a little distance up the\r\nAi. It can be reached from the right bank at this end by a ford, and\r\nthere is another ford lower down, opposite to Chiu-lien-cheng. The\r\nstream dividing the other island from the left bank is also fordable\r\nwaist-deep, but the central stream can only be crossed by means of a\r\nbridge. These islands are really low, flat, sandy deltas, with\r\noccasional clumps of small trees and patches of shrub dotting their\r\nsurface, which provide some cover for the concealment of troops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE ACTIONS ON THE YALU\r\n    APRIL 29TH-MAY 1ST.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Sassulitch's Defences]\r\n\r\nThe Russian position extended for a distance of upwards of twenty miles\r\nalong the right bank of the Yalu and Ai, from Niang-ning-chin in the\r\nsouth, to Yushukau in the north. Yushukau is a hill opposite to\r\nYulchasan, and lower down is another hill which General Sassulitch had\r\nfortified, named Makau (or Potientzy). Then comes the village of\r\nChiu-lien-cheng itself, which formed the centre of his position,\r\nstanding at a height of about 180 feet above the river. From\r\nChiu-lien-cheng a road runs in a westerly direction to Hamatan or\r\nHoh-mu-tang, a distance of about five or six miles; and another road\r\nruns down parallel with the bank of the Yalu to Antung. A further road\r\nruns from Hoh-mu-tang in a northerly direction, the most important post\r\non which is Tang-lang-fang, almost due west of Yushukau. Westward of\r\nHoh-mu-tang stretches the main road to Feng-whang-cheng and Liao-yang.\r\nSouth of Antung is the hill of Antushan, and a continual ridge of hills\r\nconnects this eminence with Niang-ning-chin, already mentioned. It will\r\nbe observed that the high ground which the Russians occupied gives a\r\ndefending force a great advantage in meeting an attack from the Yalu,\r\nas it easily commands the low-lying positions on the left bank. On the\r\nother hand, Makau, Shiu-lien-cheng, and the positions to the southward\r\nare commanded by Tiger Hill and Yulchasan, and it is therefore obvious\r\nthat if once the Japanese succeeded in occupying those heights they\r\nmust necessarily render the rest of General Sassulitch's defences along\r\nthe river bank untenable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAULING A JAPANESE HOWITZER INTO POSITION UNDER FIRE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Dispositions]\r\n\r\nAs far as can be gathered from the Japanese accounts and from the more\r\nobscure dispatches of the Russian Generals, the distribution of the\r\nCzar's forces at the beginning of the operations was as follows: Tiger\r\nHill was occupied by part of the 22nd Siberian Regiment under the\r\ncommand of General Kashtalinsky. The right wing, in the neighborhood of\r\nAntung, was formed of the 9th and 10th Regiments supported by two\r\nbatteries of artillery; while the centre, at Chiu-lien-cheng, was held\r\nby the 12th Regiment. The Reserve was formed of the 11th Regiment. The\r\nartillery were distributed at carefully-chosen positions along the\r\nwhole front, but were massed in especial strength at Makau and\r\nChiu-lien-cheng. Advanced outposts drawn from the 22nd, 23rd, and 27th\r\nRegiments of Eastern Siberian Sharpshooters occupied the islands of\r\nKulido and Cheun-song-do. A Russian regiment, it should be explained,\r\nconsists of three battalions, each of which, when brought up to its\r\nfull strength, numbers about 1,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Attacking Army]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 25th the Japanese army was massed on the left bank\r\nof the river in the following order: On the left, facing the island of\r\nCheun-song-do, was stationed the 2nd Division; the centre, occupying a\r\nposition to the north of Wiju, was composed of the Imperial Guards'\r\nDivision; and on the right, still further up the river, the 12th\r\nDivision was concentrated, in concealment behind some hilly ground, and\r\nin readiness for an important move upon the enemy's left, which will be\r\ndescribed later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clearing the Islands]\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 26th a sharp rattle of musketry told the Russians that\r\nthe attack had begun. Detachments from the Guards' Division were firing\r\nupon General Sassulitch's sharpshooters stationed on the Island of\r\nKulido. The Russians replied briskly, but the Japanese rifle fire was\r\nheavy and well-directed, and at last their position became untenable,\r\nin face not only of this infantry attack, but of a searching\r\nbombardment opened by some batteries of Kuroki's artillery, which were\r\nestablished on a hill in the rear of Wiju. They therefore retreated to\r\nthe mainland for shelter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guards Half-way Across]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this retirement been effected than the Japanese prepared\r\nto cross over to the island in boats. These craft were all in\r\nreadiness, and before long a considerable force of the Guards had\r\nlanded on the island. When this movement was perceived the enemy\r\nreturned to dispute it; but they were not in large force, and were\r\neasily repulsed. A squadron of Cossacks came to their assistance, but\r\nthe hot fire with which they were received by the Japanese infantry was\r\ntoo much for them, and they were driven back in confusion to the bank\r\nbelow Tiger Hill. The Mikado's Guards continued the pursuit across the\r\nford, and a smart encounter ensued beneath the hill. The fighting was\r\nnot of long duration, however; the Russians retired; and it became\r\nevident that there was no intention seriously to dispute the possession\r\nof the island. The attempt made by General Sassulitch's batteries to\r\ndrive the daring Japanese off the island by shrapnel fire was quite\r\nunsuccessful, and the whole defence on this side revealed an unexpected\r\nweakness. The Guards' skirmishers occupied all night the ground they\r\nhad so easily gained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parallel Movements]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the advance guard of the 2nd Division had carried\r\nthrough the same operations with equal success on the Island of\r\nCheun-song-do. The Russian sharpshooters were driven off in the\r\ndirection of Chiu-lien-cheng, and the Japanese seized the delta with a\r\nsmall force preparatory to constructing a bridge over the central\r\nstream for the passage of the main body of the division.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Searching Japanese Fire]\r\n\r\nIn these small but useful engagements the Guards suffered some slight\r\ncasualties, nine men being slightly and sixteen seriously wounded. The\r\n2nd Division sustained no casualties at all. The Russians, on the other\r\nhand, lost more heavily. They were seen to carry off a considerable\r\nnumber of dead and wounded, and they left behind them ninety-five dead\r\nhorses, which, in itself, is significant of the searching character of\r\nthe Japanese fire. The body of Lieutenant Senyoloff, commanding the\r\nMounted Scouts of the 22nd Regiment, which his comrades had not time to\r\nremove, was buried at Wiju by the Japanese themselves with all honor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bridging the Yalu]\r\n\r\nOn the following day the work of bridging the stream both at Kulido and\r\nCheun-song-do was carried out, in spite of the intermittent fire which\r\nthe Russian guns maintained upon the corps engaged. So ineffective\r\nindeed was this cannonade that the Japanese artillery did not even\r\nreply to it, and their engineers pursued their enterprise calmly and\r\nwithout substantial interruption. On the same day the naval squadron\r\nunder Rear-Admiral Hosoya rendered valuable assistance to General\r\nKuroki by its co-operation in the Yalu estuary. Two gunboats, two\r\ntorpedo-boats, and two armed steamers ascended the river as far as\r\nAntushan and effected a useful diversion in the quarter by shelling the\r\nRussian entrenchments. The bombardment must have proved destructive,\r\nfor after making a brisk reply for some time, which, however, did no\r\ndamage to the Japanese ships, the Muscovite batteries were finally\r\nsilenced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion in the Russian Councils]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 28th, the same tactics were displayed, and the\r\nposition seized by the Guards' Division and the 2nd Division on the\r\nIslands of Kulido and Cheun-song-do was consolidated. Two companies of\r\nthe former, indeed, crossed over to the mainland and reconnoitred Tiger\r\nHill, encouraged by the silence of the enemy on that commanding\r\neminence. To their surprise they found that the post had been evacuated\r\nby the Russians. No explanation has been offered of this remarkable\r\nstep; the only conclusion possible--a conclusion, indeed, strengthened\r\nby subsequent events--is that confusion reigned in the councils of the\r\nRussian commanders, and that no definite and coherent plan had been\r\nthought out by them. For on the next day General Kashtalinsky was again\r\nordered to occupy the hill, which the Japanese themselves, having other\r\nplans in view, were not yet in a position to seize effectively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuroki's Consummate Strategy]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 29th, General Kuroki began the important move on his\r\nextreme right, for which the 12th Division had been all this time kept\r\nin reserve. The operations of the Guards and the 2nd Division, useful,\r\nand indeed necessary, as they were for the purposes of a general\r\nadvance, had acted as a screen for his consummate piece of strategy by\r\nwhich the Japanese Commander turned General Sassulitch's flank and\r\nfinally captured the position. To the north of Wiju, about thirteen\r\nmiles higher up the stream of the Yalu, stands the small village of\r\nSukuchin. Here it was that the Japanese effected a crossing in October,\r\n1894, in their war with China. On that occasion the movement enabled\r\nthem to outflank a force of 30,000 men, and it is one of the remarkable\r\nfeatures of General Kuroki's dispositions for attack that they repeated\r\nin all essential particulars the tactics which proved so successful ten\r\nyears ago. Still more remarkable is it that the Russians appear to have\r\nlearned none of the lessons of the war of 1894, and to have fallen just\r\nas readily into the trap as did the Chinese. Early then on the 29th the\r\nengineer corps of the 12th Division started to construct two pontoon\r\nbridges over the Yalu at Sukuchin. Here, as in every other department\r\nof the Japanese arrangements, the organization was perfect. Not a\r\ndetail had been omitted and the work proceeded smoothly and with\r\ndispatch. By the next morning both bridges were completed and the\r\ntroops prepared to cross.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Futile Russian Opposition]\r\n\r\nThe Russian Commander, who had at last got wind of the manoeuvre\r\nwhich was taking place at this point, had detached a small force to\r\noppose the passage of the river, and when at 10.40 the vanguard of\r\nGeneral Inouye's Division began to march on to the pontoons, a fierce\r\nfire was directed upon it from the opposite bank. The Japanese,\r\nhowever, retorted both with rifle fire and artillery, and the fusillade\r\nof the Russians was soon checked, with the result that by the afternoon\r\nthe whole of the 12th Division had gained the right bank of the Yalu\r\nwith the loss of only two men killed and twenty-seven men wounded.\r\nGeneral Inouye then marched forward to seize Yulchasan and Tiger Hill,\r\nwhich positions, after their first evacuation, had again been occupied\r\nby the Russians under General Kashtalinsky.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Masked Batteries at Work]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Guards' Division, assisted by a heavy bombardment\r\nfrom the batteries below Wiju, was pressing an attack upon Tiger Hill\r\nfrom the Island of Kulido, an attack which successfully diverted the\r\nattention of General Kashtalinsky from the advance upon his left, and\r\nprevented him from offering it any formidable resistance. The Japanese\r\nartillery in particular distinguished itself. Never was superiority of\r\ngeneralship more strikingly displayed than it was by General Kuroki in\r\nthis case. The position was admirably selected by him; the work of\r\nplacing the batteries was carried out with such skill that the Russians\r\nwere kept in entire ignorance of their whereabouts; and finally when\r\nthey opened fire on the morning of the 30th the heavy character of the\r\nguns employed took the enemy absolutely by surprise. On the delta\r\nimmediately below Wiju was a belt of trees of which the Japanese\r\nGeneral had at once seen the potentialities; and behind its screen his\r\nengineers had constructed gun pits, in which were concealed several\r\nbatteries of howitzers. These pieces of ordnance did terrible execution\r\nin the Russian lines in the course of the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Serpentine Line of Dark Forms]\r\n\r\nTo the onlookers standing on the hills behind Wiju the wide field of\r\nbattle spread before them presented a highly picturesque spectacle, and\r\nas the attack developed the interest became intense. Hardly had the\r\nadvance of the Guards begun upon the Island of Kulido when a long\r\nserpentine line of dark forms could be seen winding in and out of the\r\nheights on the right bank of the river to the north of Tiger Hill. They\r\nwere the men of the 12th Division slowly but surely creeping upon the\r\nRussian left. For miles they pressed forward without coming into view\r\nof the Russian artillerymen on Tiger Hill, but at last the first\r\ndetachments, rounding the shoulder of one of the nearer hills, were\r\nexposed to the enemy. Instantly a terrific burst of shrapnel fire broke\r\nout from General Kashtalinsky's field batteries. Steadily, however, and\r\nwithout a check the brave Japanese advanced from height to height, and\r\nat the same time the batteries on the left bank above Wiju came to\r\ntheir aid. The fire of the Russians had unmasked the position of their\r\nguns on the hill, and the Japanese artillerymen rained upon them a\r\nterrible hail of shells which soon reduced them to silence and\r\neffectually covered the advance of the infantry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two Thousand Deadly Thunderbolts]\r\n\r\nBut now the Guards, who were engaged in effecting a lodgement on the\r\nlower slopes of Tiger Hill, came in for the attentions of General\r\nSassulitch's field batteries at Makau and Chiu-lien-cheng. Believing\r\nthat the Japanese possessed only guns of the same calibre, and totally\r\nignorant of the deadly engines of warfare which Kuroki had so\r\nskillfully concealed behind the innocent-looking belt of trees on the\r\ndelta, the Russian Commander took no pains to mask his ordnance.\r\nTherefore when his shrapnel swept the Island of Kulido and played havoc\r\namong the Guards, his whole position in this part of the field lay\r\nexposed. At once the howitzers on the delta close to the opposite shore\r\nbegan to belch forth a terrible fire of shrapnel and common shell,\r\nwhich tore up the ground all around the Russians, killing their gunners\r\nand dismounting their guns. This bombardment was afterwards described\r\nby General Kashtalinsky, in a dispatch to the Commander-in-Chief, as\r\n\"extraordinarily violent and prolonged,\" and he added that in its\r\ncourse more than 2,000 shells were fired upon the defenders' position.\r\nThe fearfully destructive and demoralizing effect of this cannonade was\r\nindeed patent at once to the observers upon the left bank of the river.\r\nThe Makau Hill was described by one correspondent as transformed in\r\nappearance into an active volcano, from which belched forth clouds of\r\ngrey-black smoke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inferno Set Loose]\r\n\r\nIt was Inferno let loose. The sides of the hill were riddled and\r\nscored, solid rocks were smashed like crockery, as the screaming\r\nmissiles of death burst among the trenches and filled them with dead\r\nand wounded. Yet amid it all the Russian artillerymen stood steadily to\r\ntheir guns as long as their guns were left in their places, and as long\r\nas any men remained to work them. But the best troop in the world could\r\nnot endure such a murderous fire for long. The heavy pieces of field\r\nordnance were knocked from their carriages like ninepins, the soldiers\r\nfell around them in scores, and at last the batteries sank into silence\r\nand the dark forms of the defenders were seen from afar fleeing for\r\nrefuge behind the further line of the heights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Howitzer High-Angle Fire]\r\n\r\nThis fierce artillery engagement lasted about half an hour, and while\r\nit produced such deadly and demoralizing effects on the enemy it left\r\nthe Japanese practically unharmed behind their screen of trees. Their\r\nhowitzers, unlike the Russian field guns, could do the maximum of\r\nexecution by means of high-angle fire and their battery emplacements\r\nwere so carefully and skilfully masked that the shrapnel of the enemy,\r\neffective as it may have appeared to be from the right bank, did them\r\nscarcely any damage. Their casualties, indeed, were only two men killed\r\nand twenty-five wounded. It was a remarkable triumph of scientific\r\nwarfare, and proved that in the artillery branch of the service at all\r\nevents the Japanese had nothing further to learn from European models.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIANS COLLECTING WOUNDED ON THE NIGHT AFTER THE\r\nBATTLE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Co-operation of Gunboats]\r\n\r\nWhile this bombardment was engaging the Russian centre and diverting\r\nits attention from the enveloping movement of the 12th Division on the\r\nleft, and from the advance of the Guards upon Tiger Hill, the gunboat\r\nflotilla of Admiral Hosoya again operated with great effect against the\r\nRussian lines lower down the river at Antushan and Niang-ning-chin.\r\nThis simultaneous attack along the whole of his front placed General\r\nSassulitch in a position of the utmost difficulty. He was unable to\r\ntell from which part of the field the real danger would come. It is\r\nclear, however, from the dispatches of his subordinate, General\r\nKashtalinsky, that that officer appreciated the true nature of the\r\nJapanese operations, and that he recognized the impossibility of\r\nholding Chiu-lien-cheng after his flank had been turned by General\r\nInouye's Division. Early on the 30th he ordered the 22nd Regiment back\r\nfrom Tiger Hill to the right bank of the Ai River and endeavored to\r\nstrengthen the position on Makau and Yukushau, and his dispatch to\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin indicates that he represented to General Sassulitch\r\nthe difficulty with which even that line of defence could be\r\nmaintained, and urged a retreat to Hoh-mu-tang. At night, however, he\r\nreceived orders from his superior to remain and accept battle at the\r\nhands of the Japanese, and he had nothing for it but to obey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miserable Array of Russians]\r\n\r\nIt was with a miserably inadequate force that he was thus compelled to\r\noppose the advance of a foe which had already proved itself so\r\ndetermined and so resourceful. At the ford on his extreme left he\r\nstationed two battalions of the 22nd Regiment. The 12th Regiment of the\r\nEast Siberian Rifles held the hills behind, from Yukushan to Makau,\r\nsupported by the 3rd Battery of the 6th Brigade of Artillery and a\r\nnumber of machine guns. General Sassulitch himself was in command of\r\nthe 9th and 10th Regiments occupying Chiu-lien-cheng and the chain of\r\nhills stretching down to Antung, and the 11th Regiment was kept in the\r\nrear as a reserve. General Mishchenko's Brigade of Cossacks, though in\r\nthe neighborhood, does not appear to have been actually engaged in the\r\nbattle at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four Miles of Japanese]\r\n\r\nOn the Japanese side all was in readiness for the great advance by the\r\nnight of the 30th, and General Kuroki telegraphed to the General Staff\r\nat Tokio that the attack would begin at dawn. On the left, the 2nd\r\nDivision, under General Nishi, occupied the southern end of\r\nCheun-song-do; the Imperial Guards, under General Hasegawa, held the\r\nnorthern end of that island, as well as Tiger Hill; and on their right\r\nwas stationed the 12th Division, facing the Ai, on a wide front\r\nextending for over four miles. In these positions the Army bivouacked\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Moment of Tense Expectancy]\r\n\r\nBy five o'clock on the morning of Sunday, May 1st, the whole force from\r\nnorth to south was on foot, and prepared to move like one mighty\r\nmachine to the execution of the great task before it. As the grey dawn\r\nlifted the curtain upon the tremendous drama which was about to unfold\r\nitself before them, the watchers behind Wiju saw the long lines of\r\nblack forms marshalling upon the islands and taking cover behind the\r\nscrub and in the hollows of the low sand hills. Far out beyond Tiger\r\nHill and along the left bank of the River Ai the lines extended, moving\r\nout of the shelter of the adjacent hills. It was a moment of tense\r\nexpectancy. Now for the first time were Japanese Infantry to be pitted\r\nagainst European troops armed with modern weapons, in a conflict on the\r\ngrand scale. Would they come out of the ordeal with triumph? Would they\r\nin their sphere of warfare rival the great achievements of their naval\r\nbrethren?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The General Attack Begins]\r\n\r\nBut before the infantry could move forward it was necessary to search\r\nthe Russian batteries once more and reduce them, if possible, to\r\nineffectiveness. The howitzers and field artillery, therefore, again\r\nopened their terrible fire of shell and shrapnel upon the heights\r\nopposite, the storm raging with especial severity over Chiu-lien-cheng\r\nand the Makau and Yushukau ridge. But to this the enemy made no reply.\r\nAfter the awful experience of the previous day, they had been compelled\r\nto withdraw many of their guns, and the front of their position was, as\r\nit afterwards appeared, deprived of this defence altogether. General\r\nKashtalinsky, as already stated, had with him one battery of field\r\nartillery, but taught by past lessons he declined to unmask its\r\nwhereabouts until the advance of the Mikado's troops made it absolutely\r\nnecessary. After half an hour, therefore, the Japanese ceased their\r\nbombardment for the time being, and at last General Kuroki gave the\r\neagerly-expected order for a general attack along the whole line.\r\nGladly the soldiery of Dai Nippon answered the call, burning as one man\r\nto plant the flag of the Rising Sun upon the soil of the territory from\r\nwhich ten years ago they had been so contemptuously driven out by the\r\nhaughty Muscovite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ridges Alive with Flame]\r\n\r\nTo the 12th Division fell the perilous glory of crossing first, in the\r\nteeth of the Russian guns. The skirmishing line advanced first over a\r\nwide front, keeping up a harassing fire upon the enemy's trenches. A\r\nsmart response was made, but the opportunity of the Russians was yet to\r\ncome; for it was apparent that the actual crossing of the river by\r\nGeneral Inouye's main body would have to be performed in much closer\r\nformation, presenting an admirable target for artillery and rifle fire.\r\nSlowly but steadily the skirmishers pressed forward, taking advantage\r\nof every scrap of cover, and soon the whole plain was dotted with puffs\r\nof white smoke as the bullets sped on their way. Behind them came line\r\nafter line of the main storming force. At last the fords were reached,\r\nand forming into two columns the 12th Division rushed forward to gain\r\ntheir passage. At once the ridges opposite became alive with flame, and\r\na withering blast of shrapnel and rifle bullets swept across their\r\npath. The column formation which the Japanese were compelled to adopt\r\ngave the Russian marksmen every chance, and terrible loss of life\r\noccurred at this point. The leading files were mown down like grass\r\nunder the sickle; for a moment the head of the column wavered under the\r\nstorm and stood still.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surprise of the Russians]\r\n\r\nBut now the Japanese artillery found the opening they wanted. The exact\r\nposition of the Russian guns was revealed, and at once they were\r\nenfiladed by a demoralizing fire from the terrible howitzers near Wiju\r\nwhile at the same time they were attacked by General Inouye's field\r\nbatteries in front. Once again the fierce and destructive character of\r\nthe cannonade is revealed by the dispatches of the Russian commanders.\r\nJust as General Kashtalinsky, referring to the bombardment of April\r\n30th, described it as \"extraordinarily violent and prolonged,\" so\r\nGeneral Sassulitch used similar terms in regard to this new\r\nbombardment. Before the day was over the Russian Commander had more\r\nopportunities of appreciating the \"extraordinary\" quality of the troops\r\nwhose powers he, in common with more highly placed officers in the\r\nservice of the Czar, had so fatally despised; but it seems clear from\r\nthe use of the same phrase independently by the two generals that the\r\nartillery tactics of General Kuroki caused them more surprise than\r\nalmost anything else in the whole of these surprising operations. It\r\ngoes to prove that the Intelligence Department on the Russian side was\r\nnot well equipped, for the possession by their enterprising foe of\r\nheavy guns so far north in Korea seems never to have been suspected by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Plunge Across the Ai]\r\n\r\nSupported by this tremendous cannonade, the infantry of the 12th\r\nDivision pressed steadily forward. The survivors of the first line\r\nmelted into the second line, which was advancing quickly behind, and\r\ncareless of death, the gallant little Japs plunged into the waters of\r\nthe Ai up to their breasts, and waded across the ford. Notwithstanding\r\nthe raking fire, however, from General Kuroki's batteries, the Russians\r\nstuck to their posts like heroes, and the field guns of the 3rd\r\nBattery, assisted by a number of machine guns, ploughed up the ranks of\r\nthe Mikado's troops, doing terrible execution. But the Japanese were in\r\noverwhelming force, and though men were falling on every hand, the main\r\nbody pressed resistlessly forward, crossed the river, and took up a\r\nposition on the right bank, at the base of the hills. Not a moment was\r\nwasted. As the column reached the shore, it diverged regiment by\r\nregiment to right and left, spreading out in wider formation for the\r\ntask of scaling the heights. The evolution was executed with great\r\nspeed, but with the precision and steadiness of parade; and if anything\r\ncould be more impressive than the gallantry of the Japanese rank and\r\nfile, it was the skill and coolness of their officers from General down\r\nto company commander. Though it was exposed to a withering fire at\r\ncomparatively close quarters, the movements of the whole force were\r\nexecuted like those of a machine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overwhelming Legions]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that there are two fords over the Ai river, the\r\none leading from a position near Yulchasan, on the left bank, to a\r\nposition slightly north of Yukushan, on the right bank; the other\r\nopposite to Tiger Hill, and a little to the north of Makau. It was\r\nopposite to this latter ford that the bulk of General Kashtalinsky's\r\nforce was stationed, and here in consequence, the greatest losses\r\nbefell the Japanese. But while a fierce engagement was raging at Makau,\r\nthe decisive movement was taking place on the extreme left of the\r\nRussians at Yushukau. The defence at that spot was entrusted to only\r\none battalion of the 22nd Regiment of Sharpshooters, and it was\r\nimpossible for such a small contingent, gallantly as it held its ground\r\nfor a time, finally to withstand the overwhelming legions which were\r\nhurled against it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Circling Ring of Fate]\r\n\r\nFor slowly but steadily the Japanese lines encircled the hills with a\r\nring of fate, creeping up the sides with infinite nimbleness and\r\ndexterity, pausing now to take cover and return the Russian fire, then\r\nup again and climbing from rock to rock with indomitable courage and\r\nresolution. On the other hand, General Kashtalinsky bravely fought on\r\nagainst his advancing foe. With the force at his command, it was\r\nobviously a desperate undertaking, and he had sent for reinforcements.\r\nBut they came not, and for hours he had to do the best he could without\r\nthem. The fact was, of course, that General Sassulitch himself was so\r\nbusily engaged both on the right wing and at the centre that he could\r\nspare little assistance to his subordinate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devastating Artillery Bombardment]\r\n\r\nFor almost simultaneously with the advance of the 12th Division across\r\nthe Ai the Imperial Guards under General Hasegawa had forced the\r\npassage of the stream on the left, at the foot of the slope which led\r\nup to the village of Chiu-lien-cheng, while the 2nd Division, led by\r\nGeneral Nishi, crossed lower down and menaced the Russian right. Four\r\nbatteries of howitzers had been ferried across the stream from the left\r\nbank of the Yalu to the Island of Cheun-song-do, and as the skirmishing\r\nline of both divisions moved forward in a fan-like formation these\r\npowerful pieces of ordnance opened a destructive fire upon the enemy. A\r\nsharp rattle of musketry was the first sign that the Russians were\r\nprepared to contest the passage of the river in this quarter, but their\r\nfield artillery remained silent, and it turned out afterwards that all\r\nthe guns which had survived the bombardment of the previous day had\r\nbeen removed to the rear, or to strengthen General Kashtalinsky's\r\nposition. As it was, the rifle fire from the trenches was very galling,\r\nand the Japanese lost a great many men, but the devastating effects of\r\nGeneral Kuroki's artillery bombardment were beyond anything that the\r\nRussians could produce in return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Black Mass of Human Figures]\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these trenches on the ridge of the hills to the\r\nnortheast of Chiu-lien-cheng that the greatest damage was wrought. As\r\nthe Japanese infantry steadily advanced, General Sassulitch ordered\r\nforward a body of his supports from the immediate rear to occupy this\r\ntrench. In order to obey this command they had to round a small spur of\r\nthe hill and pass across the open. Their appearance against the\r\nsky-line provided a target which the Japanese gunners were not likely\r\nto neglect. Instantly a rain of shell and shrapnel was directed upon\r\nthe black mass of human figures. Men were seen falling thick and fast\r\nunder this withering fire; but still the Russians pressed on\r\nindomitably, and at the expense of great loss of life occupied the\r\ntrench, whence they in turn poured a fierce rifle-fire upon the enemy\r\nbelow them. By this time, however, the Guards were swarming over the\r\nlower slopes of the hills around Chiu-lien-cheng, and General Hasegawa\r\nsent a strong force to the left of the Russian position to turn General\r\nSassulitch's flank. At the same time General Nishi's men were climbing\r\nsteadily up the ridge further south, and were threatening the Russian\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Blood-Red Banner]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the somewhat drab aspect of warfare\r\nwhich many of the operations in the South African war assumed,\r\naccustoming us to the idea that all picturesqueness had departed from\r\nmodern combat, and that the ancient gauds and trappings so dear to the\r\nsoldier's heart had been abandoned for ever, was entirely absent from\r\nthis great battle in the Far East. The opposing forces were not\r\nseparated from one another by illimitable distances of rolling veldt\r\nand brown hills. They were, on the contrary, so near as to recall the\r\nfighting in the Franco-German War, or the bloody combats around Plevna\r\nin the great struggle between Turkey and Russia nearly thirty years\r\nago. And more remarkable still, the regimental colors which in our army\r\nare kept for ceremonial purposes in times of peace, and do not\r\naccompany the troops into the field, were carried by the Japanese in\r\nthe front of the fighting line. Their presence must have assisted the\r\nfire of the enemy considerably; but there can be no doubt, on the other\r\nhand, of the inspiriting effect on the Mikado's men of seeing the\r\nblood-red banner of their race floating in the van and beckoning them\r\nforward to victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LAST GALLANT STAND OF RUSSIAN GUNNERS.]\r\n\r\nSteadily indeed, and without pause, those flaming banners advanced upon\r\nthe doomed Russian position. The swing round of General Hasewaga's\r\ntroops to the left of Chiu-lien-cheng decided the fate of General\r\nSassulitch's centre, and after four hours' fighting the Japanese,\r\nclimbing up the ridges like cats, charged into the Russian trenches.\r\nAll the defenders who remained to contest the charge were bayonetted or\r\ntaken prisoners, but the main body of the 9th and 10th Siberian\r\nRegiments retreated stubbornly towards Hoh-mu-tang, contesting every\r\ninch of the ground. The heights, however, in this part of the field\r\nwere won, and at 9 o'clock a great shout of \"Banzai\"--the Japanese form\r\nof \"hurrah\"--went up all along the line, as the banners of the Rising\r\nSun were planted upon the ridge and waved proudly in the breeze.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fight Desperately Against Fate]\r\n\r\nOn their left the Russians under General Kashtalinsky were, as we have\r\nshown, making a more desperate resistance; but unable to obtain\r\nreinforcements in time, that gallant officer was compelled to retire\r\nbefore the advance of General Inouye's Division, which, by driving the\r\nbattalion of the 22nd Regiment in rout before it at Yushukau, had\r\ncompletely crumpled up his flank. He therefore fell back slowly towards\r\nHoh-mu-tang, fighting desperately against overwhelming odds opposed to\r\nhim. It was not till noon, seven hours after the battle began, that\r\nreinforcements were at last sent to him. Then General Sassulitch\r\nordered to his assistance the 11th Regiment, which all this time had\r\nbeen held in reserve well in the rear together with the 2nd Battery of\r\nthe 6th Brigade of Field Artillery, under Lieutenant-Colonel Mouravsky.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Sassulitch's Retreat]\r\n\r\nWith this new force General Kashtalinsky set about the heavy task of\r\ncovering the retreat of the 12th and the 22nd Regiments, or as much of\r\nthem as was left, and also of checking the Japanese advance if possible\r\nuntil the 9th and 10th Regiments had made sure of their communications\r\nalong the road to Feng-hwang-cheng. It was now that the fiercest and\r\nbloodiest fighting of the day took place, and that the Russians in\r\nparticular suffered their heaviest losses. For no sooner had General\r\nKuroki captured the whole ridge from Antung and Antushan in the south\r\nto Yukushan in the north than he ordered his force, strengthened by the\r\nreserves, to hasten at full speed along three lines in the direction of\r\nthe Feng-whang-cheng road to cut off General Sassulitch's retreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Chase]\r\n\r\nA strong detachment from General Inouye's Division, therefore, crossed\r\nwestwards to Tan-lang-fang; the Imperial Guards marched rapidly along\r\nthe main road from Chiu-lien-cheng; and the 2nd Division spread out\r\ntowards Antung and pursued the retiring 9th and 10th Regiments. It was\r\nthe Guards Division and the 12th Division with whom General\r\nKashtalinsky had to deal in this last brave stand. He ordered the 11th\r\nRegiment under his chief of staff to assume a commanding position in\r\nthe rear, from which they could fire upon the enemy from two sides.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Mouravsky's battery he held in reserve; and then he\r\nordered the wearied troops of the 12th Regiment, the 22nd Regiment, and\r\nthe 3rd Battery of the 6th Brigade to retire under cover of the fire of\r\nthe 11th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Last Gallant Stand]\r\n\r\nBut before this manoeuvre could be effected the fierce pursuit of the\r\nJapanese had gained its object. Both the Guards and the 12th Division\r\nreached the spot by 1 o'clock, and approaching from opposite sides,\r\nsurrounded the hapless Russians. An enfilading fire made it impossible\r\nfor the 3rd Battery to retire. Its horses were killed, and, therefore,\r\nColonel Mouravsky, who assumed the command, ordered the gunners to take\r\nup a position where they stood and return the Japanese fire at close\r\nquarters. This they did with the greatest gallantry. They fought on\r\nsteadily till not a man was left standing, their brave commander,\r\nColonel Mouravsky, himself being among the last to fall. In the\r\nmeanwhile, a company with machine guns had been ordered up to the\r\nassistance of the 3rd Battery. The officer in command, seeing the\r\ndifficult situation of Colonel Mouravsky, took up a position, in the\r\nwords of General Kashtalinsky's dispatch, \"on his own initiative.\" He\r\nwas no more fortunate than his superior officer. He, too, had entered\r\nthe fatal ring of fire, and half his men and horses were shot down\r\nbefore he could render any effective service. An attempt to bring away\r\nhis guns by hand and to take them under shelter of the hills under the\r\nterrible cross fire to which he was exposed, was no more successful,\r\nand the guns ultimately fell into the hands of the enemy. The case\r\nbeing evidently hopeless, the 2nd Battery, which had been brought up as\r\na reinforcement to the 11th Regiment, was ordered back to rejoin the\r\nreserve by another road, but half its horses, too, were killed, and,\r\nfinding it impossible to ascend the slopes without them, the officer in\r\ncommand brought his guns back to their original position, and there\r\nbravely, but unavailingly, received the Japanese attack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rifle Fire and Cold Steel]\r\n\r\nNow ensued a fierce and bloody hand-to-hand combat, in which the utmost\r\nheroism was displayed on both sides. Closer and closer pressed the\r\nJapanese till the opposing forces were almost looking into one\r\nanother's eyes, and rifle-fire was abandoned for cold steel. Again and\r\nagain the Japanese desperately dashed themselves upon the serried ranks\r\nopposed to them, and again and again, in spite of the fearful execution\r\nwrought by each charge, they were hurled back. But bayonet charge\r\nfollowed bayonet charge, and at last the devoted band of Russians could\r\nhold out no more. In some quarters of the field the white flag was\r\nhoisted and numbers of men surrendered. But the main body, shattered as\r\nit was and a mere shadow of its former strength, fought its way\r\nthrough. A broken remnant of the 12th Regiment cut its way through and\r\ncarried off the colors in safety, torn and riddled indeed, but not\r\ndisgraced. The same fate befell the 11th Regiment, a small body of\r\nwhich, after several hours' fighting, forced a passage out of the melee\r\nand retreated to Hoh-mu-tang with its colors preserved. But the losses\r\nof this regiment were enormous. Colonel Laming, the Colonel Commandant,\r\nLieutenant-Colonels Dometti and Raievsky, and forty subordinate\r\nofficers were left dead upon the field, and 5,000 non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men were killed or wounded. More than 30 officers and 400\r\nmen surrendered. The casualties sustained by the Japanese were nearly\r\n1,000 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  Russian Demoralization--On the Heels of the Enemy--Remarkable\r\n    Japanese Strategy--The Paper Army--The Thin Black Line of\r\n    Reinforcements--Position of the Russian Army--Kuropatkin Tied\r\n    to his Railway--The Second Scheme of Attack--A Model of\r\n    Organization--Perfect Secrecy of Plans--Cutting off Port\r\n    Arthur--Alexeieff's Command of Language--And the Sober\r\n    Truth--Third Blocking Attempt--Lurid Flashing of\r\n    Searchlights--On the Bones of their Predecessors--Half the\r\n    Passage Blocked--Honored but Unarmed--Russian\r\n    Acknowledgements--Terrific Casualties--Togo for Liao-tung--The\r\n    Japanese Landings--Escape of Alexeieff--Port Arthur Isolated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Demoralization]\r\n\r\nThe signal victory of the despised Japanese at the Yalu River filled\r\nofficial circles in St. Petersburg with the liveliest dismay and shook\r\nthat determined optimism which had survived even the unexampled series\r\nof naval disasters sustained by the power of the Czar in the Far East.\r\nThere seems never to have been the least doubt among the Grand Dukes\r\nand the Bureaucrats by whom the Emperor was surrounded that whatever\r\nfate might befall the fleet, the \"yellow monkeys,\" as they elegantly\r\ncalled their foes, would fly headlong before the onslaught of the\r\nRussian soldiery, accustomed as it was to victory on many a bloody\r\nfield in Europe. The fatuity of this overweening confidence now stood\r\nrevealed, and it was at last tardily recognized that as stern a task\r\nawaited the Russian forces on land as at sea. But St. Petersburg\r\nofficialdom, wounded in pride and shaken in nerve as it was, still\r\npreserved a bold front to the world, and excuses for the disaster that\r\nhad befallen the Russian arms were as prolific as ever. The army at the\r\ndisposal of General Sassulitch, it was explained, was but a small one;\r\nthat commander had blundered, and by giving battle to an overwhelmingly\r\nsuperior force, had disobeyed or misunderstood the orders of General\r\nKuropatkin; and in any case, although severe losses were admitted, the\r\nmain body had retreated in good order to Feng-hwang-cheng, and the\r\n_morale_ of the troops was unshaken. The plea that General Sassulitch\r\nwas solely responsible for the defeat which had befallen the Muscovite\r\narms, and that he had failed to follow the instructions of his\r\nsuperior, has already been dealt with, and its extreme improbability\r\nhas been demonstrated, though, even if it were accurate, it would throw\r\na very unflattering light upon the powers of Russian leadership in the\r\nhigher commands. It was soon, however, to be shown that the suggestion\r\nthat the army of the Yalu had retired in good order and with unshaken\r\n_morale_ was equally devoid of truth. As a matter of fact, the fierce\r\npursuit of the Japanese and the heavy losses which they inflicted upon\r\nthe retreating Russians at Hoh-mu-tang and elsewhere on the road to\r\nFeng-hwang-cheng reduced the defeat to an utter rout, and it became\r\nimpossible for Sassulitch to make a stand at the latter point,\r\nnaturally strong as it was and admirably calculated to resist an attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER THREE MONTHS.\r\n\r\nThe war began with the night attack on Port Arthur on February 8, but\r\nit was not until two months later that the Japanese appeared on the\r\nsouth-eastern border of Manchuria. On April 4 they occupied Wiju, on\r\nthe 21st troops began to land at Tatungkau, and on May 1 took place the\r\nfirst great battle of the campaign, when the Japanese forced the\r\npassage of the Yalu, and drove the Russians back upon Feng-wang-cheng.\r\nOn May 6 the latter place was occupied without resistance.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the Heels of the Enemy]\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two spent in recuperating his tired troops, whose\r\ntremendous exertions during the previous week must have tested their\r\npowers of endurance to the utmost, and also in bringing his heavy guns\r\nand supply train across the river from Wiju, in preparation for the\r\nmarch General Kuroki began a forward movement into Manchuria with his\r\nwhole army. The cavalry led the advance, operating over a wide area of\r\ncountry and sweeping the scattered units of the Russians before it.\r\nSome sharp skirmishes took place at Erh-tai-tsu and San-tai-tsu, but no\r\nreal difficulty was interposed in the way of the victorious Japanese,\r\nwho drove the enemy in flight before them. On May 6th the foremost\r\ncavalry vedettes reached Feng-hwang-cheng, and instead of finding the\r\nstrongly held entrenchments which the Russian press was even then\r\nbusily assuring a sceptical Europe would prevent any further advance on\r\nthe part of the presumptuous foe, they discovered that the troops of\r\nGeneral Sassulitch had been withdrawn, and they entered the deserted\r\ntown without having to fire a shot. The leading columns of the\r\ninfantry, following quickly behind, marched in and took possession on\r\nthe same day. Before his hurried departure General Sassulitch had\r\nordered the magazine to be blown up, but large quantities of hospital\r\nand other stores fell into the hands of the Japanese. General Kuroki's\r\nmain body was not far in the rear, and the position of the whole army\r\nwas soon securely established at this important point. Feng-hwang-cheng\r\nis situated at a mountain pass on the Liao-yang road, at a distance of\r\nabout 25 miles from the Yalu. As already stated, it possesses great\r\nstrategical importance. It is the centre at which the roads meet,\r\ncoming from Liao-yang, Haicheng, and Kaiping, places which are situated\r\nat about equal distances from one another along the Manchurian railway\r\nfrom north to south, and it therefore constitutes a _point d'appui_\r\nfrom which a force could be thrown against any of them, while it is\r\nitself a position of great strength. General Kuroki immediately began\r\nto entrench himself strongly at this spot and to consolidate his\r\nforces, while he waited for the highly important developments which\r\nwere now to take place in other quarters of the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE RUSSIAN TRENCHES.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarkable Japanese Strategy]\r\n\r\nA wide view of the position of affairs as they now stood over the\r\nentire field of operations is necessary at this point in order to make\r\nclear the remarkable events that followed, and to throw into full\r\nrelief the extraordinary qualities of the Japanese strategy--a strategy\r\nconceived after the most patient study of all the conditions of the\r\nproblems and worked out in practice with almost machine-like regularity\r\nand precision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Paper Army]\r\n\r\nWhen General Kuropatkin arrived at Mukden at the end of March and\r\ntook over the command from General Linevitch, he had on paper an army\r\nof over 250,000 men. It was made up as follows: 223,000 infantry;\r\n21,764 cavalry; 4,000 engineers; and artillery consisting of 496\r\nfield guns, 30 horse artillery guns, and 24 machine guns. This large\r\nforce was organized in four Army Corps, each with divisions of\r\ninfantry and its quota of artillery and cavalry; while there were\r\nalso two independent divisions of Cossacks, four brigades of Frontier\r\nGuards, railway troops, fortress artillery and a number of small\r\nunits not allotted. The First Army Corps was under the command of\r\nGeneral Baron Stackelberg, the Second under General Sassulitch, the\r\nThird under General Stoessel, and the Fourth under General\r\nZarubaieff. It was an imposing force, this army of Manchuria,\r\ncalculated to strike terror into the hearts of an Oriental enemy, but\r\nunfortunately for the Russians it lacked one thing, and that was\r\nreality. The actual position of affairs was indeed very different. To\r\nbegin with, the greater part of the troops were not near the front at\r\nall when the Commander-in-Chief appeared upon the scene to direct\r\noperations, but were being pushed along the Siberian Railway with a\r\nfeverish haste which at the same time did not denote proportionate\r\nspeed. When they did arrive they arrived in detached fragments, and\r\nthe desperate necessities of the case did not admit of adherence to\r\nthe paper arrangements. For instance, the 7th and 8th Divisions,\r\nwhich should have formed part of the Second Army Corps under General\r\nSassulitch, were, as a matter of fact, sent to assist in garrisoning\r\nPort Arthur and Vladivostock. Port Arthur, it will be remembered, was\r\nby this time under the command of General Stoessel, who was therefore\r\nunable to direct the operations of the Third Army Corps, which\r\nproperly should have been entrusted to him. On the other hand, the\r\n3rd East Siberian Rifle Division, which belonged to that Corps, and\r\nthe 6th East Siberian Rifle Division, which should have been attached\r\nto the First Army Corps, were sent to the Yalu, where, as we have\r\nalready seen, they took part in the ill-fated conflict of the 1st of\r\nMay. It will be observed from these shifts--only a few of the most\r\nnoticeable out of many--that the Army Corps system of the Manchurian\r\nArmy had completely broken down, and that the ideal of a coherent\r\nfighting force, with officers and men trained together in peace under\r\nthe conditions to which they would be subjected in war, had not been\r\nattained in the slightest degree. The lack of organization which\r\nprevailed in the distribution of the larger commands was equally\r\nmanifest in the mobilization of the units of which they were\r\ncomposed. Regiments were not complete; hastily-formed levies had to\r\nbe added to bring them up to their nominal strength; and the ranks of\r\nthe officers had to be filled up in many cases with volunteers from\r\nregiments in other parts of the Empire. The result was a composite\r\nforce very different indeed in fighting power from the splendid\r\nmachine which the Mikado's strategists had been carefully perfecting\r\nin time of peace in readiness for the struggle which they had so long\r\nforeseen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thin Black Line of Reinforcements]\r\n\r\nIn bringing even this haphazard collection of unco-ordinated units to\r\nthe front in Manchuria, the greatest difficulties had been experienced.\r\nAll that European observers had predicted about the working capacity of\r\na railway like the Trans-Siberian for the conveyance of a huge army for\r\nthousands of miles came true to the letter. Prince Khilkoff, the\r\nDirector-General of Russian Railways, undoubtedly did wonders, and the\r\ntremendous efforts which he and his staff put forth, especially in\r\nsurmounting the great natural obstacle presented by Lake Baikal, were\r\nworthy of all praise. But to carry an army of 250,000 men, with all its\r\nnecessary supplies and munitions of war, into Manchuria in the time\r\nrequired for the purpose of striking an effective blow at an enemy like\r\nthe Japanese was a task beyond the powers of any railway staff in the\r\nworld. The rickety single line, with infrequent sidings, which\r\nstretches across the steppes of Siberia from Harbin to the Urals was\r\nquite inadequate for such a feat of transport. By the middle of May,\r\ntherefore, the position in which General Kuropatkin found himself--a\r\nposition partly created by himself, as Minister of War, and partly\r\ncreated for him by the ineptitude of others--was widely different from\r\nthat which the easy and thoughtless optimists in St. Petersburg had\r\nanticipated when the war broke out. The Fourth Army Corps was not\r\nacross Lake Baikal; 30,000 or 40,000 men were shut up in the fortresses\r\nof Port Arthur and Vladivostock, and were not only useless for field\r\noperations, but were themselves liable to siege and capture; and,\r\nallowing the highest possible estimate, the Russian Commander-in-Chief\r\nhad at his disposal for assuming the offensive in Manchuria no more\r\nthan 100,000 men with 260 guns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of the Russian Army]\r\n\r\nWith this army he was holding the railway line from Mukden to Port\r\nArthur, a distance of about 230 miles. His headquarters were at\r\nLiao-yang, and he held Haicheng and Kaiping in force, while a\r\ndetachment was thrown out to the south-west and occupied Niuchwang. In\r\nthe extreme south Port Arthur, though closely blockaded from the sea by\r\nthe watchful Togo, was as yet open to communication by land, and no\r\nattempt had hitherto been made by the Japanese to secure a footing on\r\nthe Liao-tung Peninsula. On the east of the Liao-yang--Kaiping line the\r\nRussian troops occupied three important passes, namely, Ta-ling, about\r\n50 miles distant, in a northeasterly direction, from Liao-yang; the\r\nMotien-ling, about 25 miles away on the main road to Feng-hwang-cheng;\r\nand Fen-chu-ling, half way on the road from Tashihchao to Siuyen.\r\nTashihchao is on the railway midway between Haicheng and Kaiping. The\r\nMotien-ling Pass was the scene of a sanguinary combat between the\r\nChinese and the Japanese in the war of 1894, and on that occasion the\r\nMikado's forces had the greatest trouble in capturing it. Besides\r\nholding these passes General Kuropatkin had pushed forward his Cossack\r\npatrols to scour the country as far as Feng-hwang-cheng, and constant\r\nsmall encounters took place between them and General Kuroki's outposts\r\nduring the ensuing six weeks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin Tied to His Railway]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this brief statement of the Russian position that the\r\nJapanese, always provided that they could retain the command of the\r\nsea, were placed at a great strategical advantage compared with their\r\nenemy. Holding their First Army poised at Feng-hwang-cheng, they could\r\nthrow their Second and Third Armies upon the coast at any point that\r\nsuited them best for the purpose of making a great combined movement.\r\nOn the other hand, Kuropatkin was practically tied to the railway, and,\r\nwith the inadequate force at his disposal, could not advance against\r\nKuroki to destroy him in detail before the arrival of fresh armies from\r\nJapan. He was liable to attack at any point, and it was the peculiar\r\ndifficulty of his situation that he could not tell which point would be\r\nselected. As a matter of fact, when the blow fell, as it soon did with\r\ncrushing effect, he was powerless to prevent it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Second Scheme of Attack]\r\n\r\nThe chapter of strategy which now opens is a fascinating one to any\r\nstudent of war, and fortunately its main features can be readily\r\nappreciated also by any layman who makes an intelligent study of a map\r\nof Manchuria and the Liao-tung Peninsula. The prime object of the\r\nJapanese plainly was to cut General Kuropatkin's extended line of\r\ncommunications, isolate Port Arthur, and then attempt to envelope his\r\nmain force by advancing simultaneously from the south, the east, and\r\nthe northeast. It was consequently necessary, as a preliminary, to\r\nestablish the First Army securely in Manchuria, it being clear that\r\nwith this menace on his left flank, General Kuropatkin would not be\r\nable to detach many troops to the south to prevent the investment of\r\nPort Arthur. Everything, therefore, depended on the fortune that would\r\nattend the advance of General Kuroki across the Yalu, and the Moltkes\r\nat Tokio, after a patient study of all the conditions of an intricate\r\nproblem, had thought out two great alternative schemes to meet the\r\neventuality either of victory or defeat. In case of General Kuroki's\r\nfinding the task of crossing the Yalu unaided to be an insuperable one,\r\nthe Second Army, under General Oku, was to be landed at Takushan, a\r\nport on the coast some miles to the west of the mouth of the river, and\r\nthence to strike a blow at General Sassulitch's right flank. On the\r\nother hand, if Kuroki met with success, Oku's army was to be landed at\r\na point on the Liao-tung Peninsula to cut Kuropatkin's communications\r\nand invest Port Arthur. As we have seen, General Kuroki's signal\r\ntriumph at the Yalu River rendered the first alternative unnecessary,\r\nand opened the way for the more decisive and dramatic stroke involved\r\nin the second scheme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Model of Organization]\r\n\r\nBut before anything could be done to land the Second Army, either at\r\nTakushan or on the Liao-tung Peninsula, it was imperatively necessary\r\nto disarm the Russian Fleet at Port Arthur, and prevent even the\r\nremotest possibility of its interfering with the operations. Here, as\r\nalways, the two services, the army and the navy, had to work in close\r\ncorrespondence and interdependence. From the beginning of the war these\r\nseparate branches of the Japanese forces had fitted into one another\r\nlike parts of the same piece of machinery, the whole directed by one\r\nuniform purpose and striving towards one great common end. The joint\r\nschemes of the naval and military strategists at Tokio will ever\r\nprovide an invaluable object-lesson to all students of the art of war;\r\nand it may be predicted that they will prove of valuable assistance to\r\nthe strategists of our own army and navy. One of the most remarkable\r\nfeatures of the war has been the certainty and precision with which the\r\nJapanese have worked out their complex plans; it is no less remarkable,\r\nand affords a further striking evidence of their efficiency, that they\r\nfelt able, absolutely, to count upon that certainty and precision, and\r\nto make arrangements long beforehand, which with a less carefully\r\norganized scheme and less trustworthy commanders to carry it out would\r\nhave been foolhardy, or at least wasteful. Failure in any real sense\r\ndoes not seem to have entered into their calculations. One portion of\r\nthe plan, indeed, might miscarry, but, as we have seen, partial failure\r\nhad been provided against, and a rapid modification of strategy to meet\r\nthe case would have been possible. It was, in fact, one of the most\r\ninteresting examples of the application of brains to war that have ever\r\nbeen seen in the history of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perfect Secrecy of Plans]\r\n\r\nIn the action and inter-action, then, of this great double machine, the\r\narmy had done all that it was possible for it to do for the moment; and\r\nonce again it came round to the turn of the navy to make the next\r\ndecisive move. Upon the success of this move may be said to have\r\ndepended the whole success of the after operations, but, calculating\r\nwith absolute confidence upon the skill of Admiral Togo, the Mikado's\r\nstrategists had already put the Second Army into a state of complete\r\npreparation, and had even ordered it to be conveyed to a place from\r\nwhich it could be transferred to the front at any quarter at a moment's\r\nnotice. Arrangements for its embarkation were begun as soon as General\r\nKuroki reached Wiju with the First Army in the early days of April.\r\nWhen that commander was able to report that his dispositions for the\r\nattack upon the Russian entrenchments on the right bank of the Yalu\r\nwere well advanced, the process of embarking General Oku's troops was\r\nstarted at once. Not a hint was allowed to escape as to their\r\ndestination; even if the press correspondents, chafing under their\r\nenforced inaction at Tokio, had learnt the name, the censor would not\r\nhave let it pass to the outer world; but, as a matter of fact, it is\r\nsafe to say that the secret was safely locked in the breasts of half a\r\ndozen men. By April 22nd the whole army with its transports,\r\ncommissariat, ammunition train, and hospital corps, had been put on\r\nboard ship, and said farewell to the shores of Japan, vanishing, for\r\nall the world could tell, into the inane. For more than a fortnight\r\nnothing further was heard of it No one could report its landing\r\nanywhere, no one could say what it was doing, and day by day the\r\nmystery grew more mysterious. Only on May 7th was the veil lifted, when\r\nthis great army fell upon the coast of Liao-tung as if from the\r\nheavens, and proceeded to the investment of Port Arthur. The truth was\r\nthat during this fortnight it had been lying _perdu_ on some small\r\nislands close to the west coast of Korea, called the Sir James Hall\r\ngroup, and distant 160 miles in a southeastern direction from the\r\nshores of Liao-tung.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cutting off Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nHere, briefly stated, is the manner in which the scheme worked out. On\r\nMay 1st General Kuroki triumphantly crossed the Yalu and stormed the\r\nheights above Chiu-lien-cheng. On May 2nd Admiral Togo descended once\r\nmore upon Port Arthur, and blocked the harbor completely by sinking\r\neight steamers at the entrance to the channel. On the afternoon of May\r\n3rd, having made sure of the thoroughness of the work, he set off at\r\nfull speed for the Sir James Hall Islands, reaching his destination by\r\nearly morning on the 4th. Everything there was in readiness for the\r\nexpedition, and within a few hours the whole of the transports,\r\nescorted by the fleet, set sail for the east coast of Liao-tung. At\r\ndawn the next day they reached the point on the peninsula which had\r\nbeen selected for the landing--Yentoa Bay--and in a few short hours a\r\nconsiderable portion of the force had been disembarked, the resistance\r\noffered by a small detachment of Cossacks, the only force possessed by\r\nthe Russians in the neighborhood, being entirely negligible. On the 6th\r\nthe railway line was severed, and in a few days more the Japanese were\r\nsitting securely astride of the peninsula, and Port Arthur was cut off\r\nfrom the world. The scheme had been carried out like the combinations\r\nof a skilful chess player, or like the successive steps of a\r\nmathematical problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexeieff's Command of Language]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to follow the development of these operations more\r\nin detail. The first that falls to be described is the successful\r\nattempt, the third of the series, to block the entrance to the harbor\r\nof Port Arthur. But before giving the real version of this thrilling\r\nenterprise it may be interesting to quote the report sent to the Grand\r\nAdmiral unconquerable Alexeieff, whose optimism rose superior to every\r\ndisaster and the alchemy of whose dispatches could still transmute\r\ndefeat into signal victory. Here is the message, so soothing to the\r\nnerves of his fellow-countrymen, in which he announced the event that\r\nenabled the Japanese to land troops at any point they desired up their\r\nenemy's coasts:--\r\n\r\n\"I respectfully report to your Highness that a fresh attack made by the\r\nenemy last night with the object of obstructing the entrance to the\r\nport was successfully repelled.\r\n\r\n\"At 1 o'clock in the morning five torpedo-boats were perceived near the\r\ncoast from the eastern batteries. Under the fire of our batteries and\r\nwarships they retreated southward.\r\n\r\n\"At 1.45 the first fireship, escorted by several torpedo-boats, came in\r\nsight. We opened fire upon it from our batteries and warships.\r\nThree-quarters of an hour afterwards our searchlights revealed a number\r\nof fireships making for the entrance to the harbor from the east and\r\nsoutheast. The _Otvajni_, the _Giliak_, the _Gremiashtchi_, and the\r\nbatteries on the shore repulsed each Japanese ship by a well-directed\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Altogether eight ships were sunk by our vigorous cannonade, by\r\nWhitehead torpedoes launched from our torpedo-boats, and by the\r\nexplosion of several submarine mines.\r\n\r\n\"Further, according to the reports of the officers commanding the\r\nbatteries and the warship _Giliak_, two Japanese torpedo-boats were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\"After 4 a. m., the batteries and gunboats ceased fire, subsequently\r\nfiring only at intervals on the enemy's torpedo-boats, which were\r\nvisible on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"All the fireships carried quick-firing guns, with which the enemy\r\nmaintained a constant fire.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the present thirty men, including two mortally wounded officers\r\nwho sought refuge in the launches, or were rescued from the fireships\r\nby us, have been picked up. The inspection of the roadstead and the\r\nwork of saving drowning men are hindered by the heavy sea which is\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n\"We suffered no casualties with the exception of a seaman belonging to\r\nthe torpedo-boat destroyer _Boevoi_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the Sober Truth]\r\n\r\nNo one reading this remarkable account could imagine that it described\r\nan operation which ultimately sealed the doom of Port Arthur. For a\r\nmore sober but a more accurate narrative we must turn to the dispatches\r\nof Admiral Togo. On May 2nd, as already recounted, the Japanese Naval\r\nCommander-in-Chief received the news of the successful crossing of the\r\nYalu. His plans were already laid and his preparations were complete.\r\nEight merchant steamers this time had been secured for the service, and\r\nupwards of 20,000 men volunteered for the glorious duty of manning them\r\nand dying for their country. Of these, 159 were ultimately selected.\r\nThe names of the steamers were the _Mikawa_, _Sakura_, _Totomi_,\r\n_Yedo_, _Otaru_, _Sagami_, _Aikoku_, and _Asagawo_. The vessels ordered\r\nto escort the doomed hulks were the gunboats _Akagi_ and _Chokai_, the\r\n2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th destroyer flotillas, and the 9th, 10th, and 14th\r\ntorpedo-boat flotillas. The whole force, which was under the command of\r\nCommander Hayashi, started for its destination on the night of May 2nd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third Blocking Attempt]\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy circumstance, typical of the sombre, but ofttimes\r\nsplendid, tragedy of war, that of this third and most successful\r\nattempt to block the harbor the narrative is necessarily the most\r\nfragmentary and obscure, owing to the loss of life which it entailed.\r\nOn the two previous occasions, reckless as was the gallantry of the\r\nJapanese and enormous as were the risks they ran, the casualties were\r\nsurprisingly small, and the majority of the men engaged were able to\r\nreturn to their ships and tell the story of their enterprise. On this\r\nnight, however, everything was against success; the Russians were more\r\nfully prepared to meet attack than they had ever been before; their\r\nshooting was more effective; and worse still, the weather turned out\r\nwholly unfavorable, the ships had to proceed singly upon their way; and\r\nwhen they were sunk the difficulties in the way of recovering their\r\ncrews proved more than usually arduous, and most of them were either\r\nshot or drowned or taken prisoner. In spite of all these adverse\r\ncircumstances a splendid success was achieved, but it was achieved\r\nunder conditions which largely obliterated the record, and leaves but\r\nsparse material for the historian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lurid Flashing of Searchlights]\r\n\r\nThe broad outlines of the story, however, are clear. When the steamers\r\nwith their accompanying flotillas were well on their way, a strong\r\nsoutheasterly breeze sprang up, which rapidly freshened into a gale. It\r\nwas impossible in the circumstances to keep the vessels together, and,\r\nfearing that the attack would in consequence be ineffective, Commander\r\nHayashi signalled to his subordinates to abandon the expedition for the\r\ntime being. But the weather and the heavy seas prevented his signals\r\nfrom being observed, and the gallant enterprise therefore proceeded\r\nunchecked. By one in the morning the 14th torpedo-boat flotilla reached\r\nthe roadstead and pressed steadily towards the eastern side of the\r\nharbor mouth. The little vessels were soon exposed to the glare of the\r\nsearchlights, and at once a furious bombardment broke out upon them\r\nfrom the Russian gunboats and the shore batteries. For the moment they\r\nretreated, drawing the enemy's fire upon them, while the leading\r\nsteamer, which was close behind, made a dash for the channel. This\r\nvessel was the _Mikawa_, under the command of Lieut. Sosa. The\r\nRussians, as we have said, were much better prepared to resist attack\r\nthan on previous occasions. Piles of combustibles, stationed at various\r\npoints on the shore on each side of the harbor mouth, were set on fire,\r\nand cast a lurid light on the scene, throwing into strong relief the\r\ndark forms of the advancing ships, while the searchlights flashed\r\nbackwards and forwards over the unquiet surface of the sea, and made\r\nevery movement of the Japanese fatally visible to the defenders on the\r\nfortress. A storm of missiles burst over the devoted expedition, but\r\nundeterred, intent only on reaching the centre of the channel, Lieut.\r\nSosa pushed his vessel forward at the top of her speed. Nothing could\r\nstop him or his crew--nor raging sea, nor searchlight, nor even the\r\nrain of shot and shell. The _Mikawa_ stuck bravely to her course, and,\r\nbreaking through the boom which stretched across the mouth, anchored\r\nright in the middle of the channel. In a moment the fuse was lighted,\r\nand as the commander and his crew pushed off in the boats the ship blew\r\nup and sank in the fairway. The _Sakura_, which was not far behind, was\r\nless lucky than her companion. She was driven upon a rock at the\r\neastern side of the entrance, and blew up outside the channel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the Bones of their Predecessors]\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, and then came a fresh contingent of fireships,\r\nrushing upon destruction. The aim of the Russian gunners had much\r\nimproved; in the fierce glare of the searchlights and the flaming\r\nbeacons every detail of the steamers was distinctly visible, and that\r\nthey should have succeeded in advancing into the channel in the face of\r\nsuch a withering blast as swept across their course was little short of\r\na miracle. The waters, too, were thickly sown with mines, in readiness\r\nfor such an assault as this, and they did serious execution. The\r\n_Aikoku_ was distant only five cables from the mouth when she struck\r\none of these deadly engines and blew up, her race cut short just when\r\nthe goal was at hand. Her commander, Lieut. Uchida, the chief engineer,\r\nAoki, and eight of the crew were killed or drowned. The _Asagawo_ was\r\nriddled with shot, her rudder was smashed, and drifting upon the shore\r\nbeneath Golden Hill, she blew up and sank where the bones of so many of\r\nher predecessors were already reposing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Half the Passage Blocked]\r\n\r\nBut the other vessels were more successful. The _Otaru_ and the\r\n_Sagami_ reached the harbor mouth before they were sunk, and\r\ncontributed a large share to the obstruction of the entrance. The\r\n_Yedo_ did better still, for she got further up than these two others.\r\nJust as her anchor was being got ready her gallant commander, Lieut.\r\nTakayanagi, fell dead, shot through the stomach; but there was no pause\r\nin the operations. Sub-Lieut. Nagatu at once stepped into his\r\nsuperior's place, and, anchoring the ship with the utmost coolness,\r\nsank her in the fairway. The _Totomi_ did best of all, for, like the\r\n_Mikawa_, she burst through the boom in the teeth of the Russian guns,\r\ngot well inside, and turning right across the channel from east to\r\nwest, sank in that position, blocking up at least half the passage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honored, but Unarmed]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Togo, in his brief and dignified way, thus referred to the\r\nmagnificent services rendered by the men who had fallen in this great\r\nenterprise:--\"The undertaking, when compared with the last two\r\nattempts, involved a heavier casualty on our side owing to the\r\ninclemency of the weather and increased preparation for defence of the\r\nenemy. We could not save any of the officers and men of the _Otaru_,\r\n_Sagami_, _Sakura_ and _Asagawo_, and I regret that nothing particular\r\ncould be learned about the gallant way in which they discharged their\r\nduties, although the memory of their exemplary conduct will long\r\nsurvive in the Imperial navy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Acknowledgments]\r\n\r\nBut though the Japanese Commander-in-Chief could learn nothing\r\nparticular about the gallant way in which his men had performed their\r\nduties, the gap in our knowledge can fortunately be supplied, to some\r\nextent at all events, by the Russians, who bore ample and chivalrous\r\ntestimony to the splendid heroism displayed by their foes. They\r\nacknowledged, said a telegram from St. Petersburg, \"that the enemy\r\nattacked in brilliant style, seeming never to notice the murderous fire\r\nwhich greeted them.\" One incident in particular struck upon their minds\r\nand extorted from them the warmest expressions of admiration. \"On board\r\nthe fireships,\" they remarked, \"were a number of Japanese cadets, who\r\ndisplayed extraordinary bravery. As the ships were sinking several of\r\nthese lads rushed aloft, and sitting on the cross-trees of the\r\ntopmasts, fired their revolvers before they plunged into the sea.\" The\r\naccount ends with a sentence of terse significance: \"It is believed\r\nthat none were saved.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrific Casualties]\r\n\r\nOf the total of 159 men engaged in this work of desperate heroism only\r\n36 returned in safety, and of these 28 were wounded. Two officers (both\r\nmortally wounded) and 30 men were picked up by the Russians and taken\r\nprisoners. The number of the killed was 75. They had not died in vain.\r\nThe harbor of Port Arthur was now securely blocked--not permanently\r\nindeed, for while divers and dynamite can be obtained no harbor in the\r\nworld can be obstructed for ever in this way; but blocked to such an\r\nextent that the Russians could not get any big ships through for weeks,\r\neven given the most advantageous conditions in which to carry on the\r\nwork of removing the obstacles. And for the momentous operations that\r\nwere to follow the Japanese required not so much weeks as days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Togo for Liao-tung]\r\n\r\nThe fleet remained off Port Arthur till the afternoon to make sure that\r\nall the rescue work possible had been accomplished. In this duty the\r\ndestroyer and torpedo-boat flotillas rendered admirable service. Once\r\nagain, happy to relate, they emerged themselves from the dangerous\r\nenterprise with singularly slight damages, and lost only two men\r\nkilled. At last, having realized that no more remained to be done in\r\nsaving life, and having made sure that the \"bottle\" had finally been\r\n\"corked,\" Admiral Togo leaving behind a small squadron to watch Port\r\nArthur, set off at full steam with his main fleet for the Sir James\r\nHall Islands. There he was joined by the gunboat squadron under\r\nRear-Admiral Hosoya, which had rendered such effective service in the\r\nlower reaches of the river at the battle of the Yalu. The transports,\r\nwith the Second Army on board, were practically ready for departure,\r\nand on the morning of the 4th of May the whole expedition set out for\r\nthe Liao-tung Peninsula. At daybreak on the 5th Yentoa Bay was sighted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Landings]\r\n\r\nYentoa Bay is admirably suited for the landing of a large force, for\r\nthe shelving shore, with shallow waters, presents no difficulty to the\r\napproach of boats such as the Japanese use for this purpose.\r\nFurthermore, it possesses great strategical advantages. It is within\r\neasy striking distance of the railway, while the country in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood favors the advance of an attacking force and\r\ngives little opportunity for defence. The likelihood of a landing here,\r\nhowever, does not seem to have occurred to the Russians, who had\r\nprepared instead for a descent upon Niuchwang. The whole affair is an\r\nexcellent illustration of the advantages conferred upon a combatant by\r\nthe command of the sea, especially when the openings for attack are\r\nnumerous, as they are in the case of the Liao-tung Peninsula. General\r\nKuropatkin could not tell where the descent of the enemy would be made,\r\nand though he could defend some of the possible points, he could not\r\ndefend all. The Japanese, on the other hand, could select the spot that\r\nsuited them best without any serious risk of interference. Yentoa Bay\r\nwas therefore practically undefended when Admiral Togo's fleet arrived\r\nconvoying the Second Army. A troop of about 100 Cossacks was patrolling\r\nthe shore, but the gunboat squadron quickly dispersed it with a few\r\nshells, and the work of landing could then be carried through without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL STOESSEL EXHORTING HIS TROOPS IN THE DEFENSE OF\r\nPORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Escape of Alexeieff]\r\n\r\nThe first to make for the shore was a force of marines, two battalions\r\nof whom waded through the shallows and occupied the rising ground above\r\nthe shore. Within an hour the advance guard of the army itself had been\r\ndisembarked, and the rest of General Oku's troops quickly followed; the\r\nwhole process being carried out with the smoothness and dispatch which\r\ncharacterized all the operations of this kind on the Japanese side. On\r\nthe 6th, a flying column was sent to the northwards to seize the small\r\nport of Pitszewo, and more important still, another column moved across\r\nthe neck of the peninsula with great rapidity and, occupying Pulantien,\r\nbroke up the railway and cut off all communication between General\r\nKuropatkin and Port Arthur. But before this was done one notable train\r\nload of passengers managed to escape from the beleaguered fortress.\r\nChief among them were the Viceroy of the Far East, Admiral Alexeieff\r\nhimself, and the Grand Duke Boris. They left only just in time. The\r\ngallant Admiral of the inventive pen had at last discovered that the\r\nrepulse of the Japanese naval attack on which he had prided himself in\r\nhis grandiloquent dispatch to the authorities at St. Petersburg was in\r\nreality no repulse at all; that as a matter of fact the Japanese had\r\ndone just what they wanted to do; and that they were now able to\r\nproceed, in their methodical way, to land troops on the peninsula and\r\ninvest Port Arthur. That the Viceroy should be shut up in the fortress,\r\ntoo, was not to be thought of--though probably it would have been\r\nbetter for the success of General Kuropatkin's strategy if his\r\ntroublesome colleague had been safely removed out of the way for the\r\nrest of the campaign--and so by a desperate effort the gallant Admiral\r\nburst through the gradually tightening cordon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Arthur Isolated]\r\n\r\nAfter the first interruption of communications the Japanese force\r\ntemporarily withdrew, and the success of the Russians in relaying the\r\nline and in running a train loaded with ammunition through to Port\r\nArthur revived the drooping spirits of the official classes in St.\r\nPetersburg. The act was one of extreme gallantry, and reflected the\r\nhighest credit on Colonel Spiridonoff, the officer in command, but\r\nbeyond giving the garrison some greatly needed supplies it did not\r\nmaterially alter the situation. The line was again broken up, the\r\nJapanese occupied the neck of land in force, and in a few days Port\r\nArthur was completely cut off from the outer world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  The First Japanese Disaster--The \"Hatsuse\" Strikes a\r\n    Mine--Admiral Togo Undaunted--Rammed in the Fog--Renewed\r\n    Russian Hopes--The Vladivostock Squadron--A Thrill Through the\r\n    Civilized Globe--Skrydloff the Raider--Kamimura on the\r\n    Track--Approaching Port Arthur--The Importance of\r\n    Nanshan--Japanese Dispositions--General Oku's Attack--Terrific\r\n    Carnage--A General Bombardment--Chances of Defeat--Rushing the\r\n    Trenches--The Russians in Flight--Tremendous Moral\r\n    Effect--Terrific Casualties--Alarm in St. Petersburg--Fatal\r\n    Russian Strategy--Old Tactics versus New--The Veil over the\r\n    Tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Japanese Disaster]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese fleet, as we have seen in the last chapter, had once again\r\ndone its work thoroughly. The Russian fleet, crippled in the early days\r\nof the war and harried incessantly ever since, was now for weeks to\r\ncome securely shut up in the harbor of Port Arthur, and could do\r\nnothing seriously to affect the course of events. Admiral Togo, with\r\nhis six powerful battleships and his splendid cruisers, had absolute\r\ncommand of the Gulf of Pechili, and the transports from Japan were able\r\nto pour troops with perfect safety upon the shores of the Liao-tung\r\nPeninsula. It was at this moment of conspicuous success that the first\r\nserious calamity of the war overtook the Japanese Navy, and two\r\nterrible accidents occurred which filled the Russians with hope, as\r\nappearing to betoken a turn at last in the tide of fortune and to\r\nthreaten the forces of the Mikado with something like the cloud of\r\nmisfortune that had so far hung over their opponents. There was,\r\nhowever, this notable difference between the two cases. The losses\r\nsuffered by the Russians at sea were almost all due to their own lack\r\nof forethought or of skill; they seemed to court defeat, and defeat\r\ncame to them in full measure. But the blow which now befell the\r\nJapanese fleet was of a kind which the utmost ability and precaution\r\ncould hardly have prevented, and, moreover, serious as it was, it did\r\nnot materially affect the main course of the campaign, although\r\nundoubtedly it compelled the Commander-in-Chief in some degree to\r\nmodify his plan of operations.\r\n\r\nThe disaster was a double one. On one and the same day, the 15th of\r\nMay, the magnificent battleship, the _Hatsuse_, was blown up by mines\r\nand sunk with fully 500 men; and the protected cruiser, _Yoshino_,\r\ncolliding with the _Kasuga_ in a dense fog, was totally lost, only 90\r\nof her crew being saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTSIDE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Hatsuse\" Strikes a Mine]\r\n\r\nIt was at a spot ten miles southeast of Liaotishan promontory that the\r\n_Hatsuse_ met her fate. With the _Shikishima_, the _Yashima_, and two\r\ncruisers, she was engaged in watching Port Arthur and protecting the\r\nlanding of troops on the peninsula. Heavy fogs come off the land in the\r\nGulf of Pechili at this period of the year, and during the morning\r\nnavigation had been rendered difficult owing to this reason, but by 11\r\no'clock the weather had changed and the sky was clear. No enemy was in\r\nsight, when suddenly, without any warning, a shock was felt under the\r\nstern of the _Hatsuse_ and a heavy explosion took place, damaging her\r\nsteering gear. She signalled to the other ships at once to stand by and\r\ngive assistance, but before anything could be done another mine\r\nexploded under her and tore a great yawning hole in her plates. The\r\nwater rushed into her in torrents, and at once the great ship began to\r\nsettle down. In a few moments, with appalling swiftness, she sank like\r\na stone, with all her freight of humanity. Had the catastrophe occurred\r\nduring the night hardly a man could have been saved, but fortunately in\r\nthe broad daylight something could be done to lessen the tale of death.\r\nThe boats of the other battleships and the cruisers were quickly upon\r\nthe spot and succeeded in picking up 300 officers and men out of a\r\ntotal complement of about 800. Among these were Rear-Admiral Nashiba\r\nand Captain Nakao, the commander of the vessel. The list of the drowned\r\nincluded some of the brightest officers of the Japanese Navy, including\r\nCommander Tsukamoto, Commander Count Nire, and Commander Arimori.\r\nBesides these, five second lieutenants, five engineers, two surgeons,\r\nsix midshipmen, four engineer cadets, and ten non-commissioned officers\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of rescue was proceeding, sixteen of the Russian\r\ntorpedo-boat destroyers seized the opportunity to come out of the\r\nharbor and effect a diversion, but the Japanese destroyer flotillas\r\nengaged them hotly, and other cruisers from Togo's fleet coming up with\r\nall speed, drove them back into Port Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admiral Togo Undaunted]\r\n\r\nThe _Hatsuse_, which was built at Elswick in 1899 after the type of the\r\nEnglish ship _Majestic_, was a ship of 15,000 tons displacement, and\r\n15,000 indicated horse-power. She could steam 18 knots, her armor was\r\n14.6 inches, and the weight of her broadside fire was 4,240 lbs. Her\r\ndestruction of course meant a serious weakening of Togo's first\r\nfighting line, for six battleships were by no means too large a force\r\nfor the work he had to do. Moreover, the _Hatsuse_, with the _Asahi_,\r\n_Shikishima_, and _Mikasa_, were the most modern and up-to-date ships\r\nof their class in the fleet; the _Yashima_ and the _Fuji_, which\r\ncompleted the list, being older and less heavily armed vessels.\r\nNevertheless the grip of the Japanese Admiral upon the beleaguered port\r\nnever slackened one whit, and in the event his five battleships, with\r\ntheir accompanying cruisers, were destined to prove more than a match\r\nfor the navy of the Czar in the great battle in blue water which took\r\nplace three months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe sinking of the _Yoshino_ was not so heavy a blow, but it was\r\nserious enough in the circumstances, and the loss of life was in itself\r\ngreatly to be deplored. This second-class protected cruiser was also\r\nbuilt at Messrs. Armstrong's famous works on the Tyne. She was of 4,180\r\ntons displacement, and her engines had an indicated horse-power of\r\n15,750, with a speed of 23 knots, and a weight of broadside fire of 780\r\nlbs. She was quite an old ship, as modern men-of-war go, having been\r\nlaunched in 1892, and taking an honorable part in the Chino-Japanese\r\nwar of 1895.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rammed in the Fog]\r\n\r\nOn the fatal 15th of May she formed one of the cruiser squadron which,\r\nunder the command of Rear-Admiral Dewa, was engaged in the blockading\r\noperations outside Port Arthur. The squadron had been standing off the\r\nharbor during the night of the 14th, and early in the morning steamed\r\nsouthwards. An impenetrable fog concealed everything from view, and the\r\nbig ships had to proceed with the utmost caution. But in such difficult\r\ncircumstances the utmost caution is sometimes unavailing, and at 1.40\r\nthe _Kasuga_, one of the twin ships recently purchased from the\r\nArgentine Government, rammed the _Yoshino_ on the port stern. A\r\nterrible gap was torn in the hull of the unfortunate cruiser, and at\r\nonce she began to settle down to starboard. From the meagre accounts\r\nfurnished by the survivors, it is clear, as indeed might have been\r\nexpected, that the most perfect discipline prevailed on board the\r\ndoomed vessel. Collision mats were quickly got out and placed over the\r\nhole, but the injury was too severe to be dealt with by such means, and\r\nthe swift inrush of water made all efforts to save the vessel vain.\r\nCaptain Sayegi, the commander of the ship, ordered all the crew onto\r\nthe upper deck, and the boats were lowered without delay, but the\r\ndisaster was too sudden for them to be of any use. Five were lowered on\r\nthe starboard side and one on the port, but before they could get clear\r\nthe cruiser listed heavily to starboard and went down, smashing all the\r\nfive boats on that side to pieces. The cutter, which was lowered on the\r\nport side, was the only boat that escaped. With perfect coolness and\r\nself-devotion the captain remained on the bridge and shouted\r\nencouragement to his men as they were getting into the boats. When last\r\nseen he was shaking hands with his second in command, Commander\r\nHirowateri. In another moment both officers had gone down with their\r\nship. The boats of the _Kasuga_ were on the spot with all possible\r\nspeed, and succeeded in picking up 90 of the crew, but the rest,\r\nnumbering upwards of 270, perished with their captain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewed Russian Hopes]\r\n\r\nWhen this two-fold disaster became known, the Russians were naturally\r\nelated and even filled with renewed hope. Its true proportions, too,\r\nwere greatly exaggerated, and in the expectation that the Japanese\r\nwould be seriously hindered in their landing operations on the coast of\r\nLiao-tung, General Kuropatkin countermanded the evacuation of\r\nNiuchwang, which had already partly taken place, and his forces once\r\nagain occupied that port. However, as we have already stated, the loss\r\nhe had sustained did not lessen the grip maintained by Admiral Togo\r\nupon Port Arthur. His weakened condition did, indeed, at a later period\r\ngive the Russian fleet, after it had been patched up with infinite\r\npains and difficulty, an admirable opportunity to break through the\r\ncordon, but the attempt was made with singular feebleness, and the\r\nadmiral in command took his ships back to the refuge of the harbor\r\nwithout effecting anything. On the other hand, the destruction of the\r\n_Hatsuse_ and the _Yoshino_, by necessitating the withdrawal of some\r\nships from Admiral Kamimura, who was guarding the Korean Straits,\r\nindirectly gave the Vladivostock squadron a chance of raiding the coast\r\nof Japan for some time with impunity, of destroying a great deal of\r\nmerchant shipping, and incidentally of bringing about the most serious\r\ninternational complications, in which Great Britain, as the chief\r\ntrading country of the world, was the power principally involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SKIRMISH ON THE MANCHURIAN RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vladivostock Squadron]\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient at this point briefly to advert to the exploits\r\nof this squadron, which have necessarily been put on one side in the\r\nrecent course of the narrative by the claims of the more important\r\nevents. After the destruction of two small Japanese merchantmen on the\r\n11th of February nothing more was heard of Captain Reitzenstein's\r\ncruisers for more than two months. In April, however, the command was\r\ntaken over by a more highly-placed officer, Rear-Admiral Jessen, and a\r\nsudden burst of activity took place. With the _Rossia_, the _Rurik_,\r\nand the _Gromoboi_, and a flotilla of torpedo-boats and destroyers, the\r\nnew commander made a raid upon the east coast of Korea at Gensan. At\r\nthat very time Admiral Kamimura's squadron started on a voyage\r\nnorthwards to search for the Russians, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe two would have met, but by a stroke of the most perverse ill-luck\r\none of those dense spring fogs, which descend upon the Sea of Japan\r\nlike a pall, intervened and the opposing squadrons passed close to one\r\nanother without discovering their proximity. When, totally baffled by\r\nthese weather conditions, Kamimura returned to Gensan after a three\r\ndays' cruise, he found to his chagrin that the Russians had visited the\r\nport in his absence and had even sunk a small merchant steamer called\r\nthe _Goyo Maru_. But of more serious importance still was the\r\ndestruction of the _Kinshiu Maru_, a transport with 124 soldiers of the\r\n37th Regiment of Infantry on board. She fell in with the enemy's ships\r\non the night of the 25th while they were on their way back to\r\nVladivostock. A summons to surrender was met by a haughty refusal. An\r\nhour's grace was given, at the end of which a torpedo was discharged\r\nagainst the doomed vessel, striking her amidships. Under the orders of\r\ntheir officers the men fell in upon the deck, as calmly and steadily as\r\nif on parade, to wait for inevitable death. The officers themselves,\r\nfive in number, following the stern traditions of the ancient Samurai\r\nclan, went below and committed suicide; but the rank and file\r\ndetermined that they would strike one blow at the enemy before they\r\ndied, and so they opened a gallant but ineffective fire upon the\r\nRussians with their rifles. The cruisers made a deadly reply with their\r\nmachine guns, tearing great gaps in the masses of men thickly gathered\r\ntogether on the deck of the transport. Still, however, the soldiers\r\nfought on with desperate bravery, until another torpedo brought the\r\ntragic drama to a swift conclusion, sinking the ship in a few seconds.\r\nUndaunted even at the moment of death, the Japanese went down with\r\ntriumphant shouts of \"Banzai\" upon their lips. Seventy-four of the rank\r\nand file perished, but forty-five others escaped by means of the\r\nsteamer's boats, which they found floating on the sea, and on the 29th\r\nthey arrived at Gensan with their thrilling story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Thrill Through the Civilized Globe]\r\n\r\nIt was a story mournful indeed in one aspect, but in all others\r\nglorious and inspiring. It may be doubted, indeed, whether any one\r\nevent which had hitherto occurred in the whole course of the war so\r\ninflamed the martial ardor of the Japanese and filled them with such\r\nhigh hopes for a successful issue from the great conflict upon which\r\nthey had entered, as the splendid heroism and calm self-sacrifice with\r\nwhich the soldiers and bluejackets on board the _Kinshiu Maru_ met\r\ntheir death. Who could withhold the conviction that if this was the\r\nspirit in which the sons of Dai Nippon advanced to the work that lay\r\nbefore them, no misfortune, no temporary defeat could in the end\r\nprevent victory from resting upon the banners of the Rising Sun? Nor\r\nwas the moral effect of the deed confined to Japan. The story sent a\r\nthrill through the whole civilized globe, and taught the nations of\r\nEurope and the masters of the New World that, accustomed as they were\r\nto acts of daring and devotion among their own people, a race had\r\narisen in the Far East whose dauntless bearing in war they could not\r\nhope to surpass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skrydloff the Raider]\r\n\r\nAnother month elapsed before the Vladivostock squadron proved\r\ntroublesome again. It had then come directly under the control of the\r\nnew Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific fleet, Admiral Skrydloff, who had\r\nbeen appointed to succeed the ill-fated Makaroff, and whose reputation\r\nin the Russian navy was second only to that of his distinguished\r\npredecessor. Unfortunately for Russia, Admiral Skrydloff arrived in the\r\nFar East too late to reach his main fleet. At Harbin he learnt that\r\nPort Arthur was invested both by land and sea, and that it was\r\nimpossible for him to assume the command at the place where his\r\nservices were most needed. He was, therefore, compelled to go on to\r\nVladivostock instead and direct the operations of the cruiser squadron\r\nthere in the desperate hope that at a later period an opportunity might\r\noccur of effecting a junction with his Port Arthur fleet. A further\r\npiece of bad news awaited him at the northern port. One of the four\r\ncruisers which were all that now furnished his attenuated command had\r\ngone ashore in a fog a few days previously, and had become a total\r\nwreck. This was the _Bogatyr_. She was, indeed, the smallest ship in\r\nthe squadron, being a second-class protected cruiser of 6,750 tons, but\r\nher speed was high, and her loss in the dark circumstances of the hour\r\nwas a serious blow. However, the gallant Admiral proceeded to make the\r\nbest of the material which lay at his disposition, and in the course of\r\nthe next two months he pursued most vigorous tactics, venturing\r\nsouthwards with great frequency, harrying the coasts of Japan, and\r\nbringing maritime commerce in that part of the world almost to a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kamimura on the Track]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Kamimura with his cruisers made the most strenuous efforts to\r\ncatch his elusive enemy, but the bad luck which had visited him at\r\nGensan at the end of April continued to dog him still for a long time.\r\nAgain and again a convenient fog intervened to favor the escape of the\r\nRussians; moreover, the Japanese squadron had to be depleted in order\r\nto furnish aid to the main fleet which was blockading Port Arthur, and\r\nassisting in the landing of troops; and furthermore, the strategic\r\nnecessity of closely guarding the Straits between Japan and Korea and\r\npreventing the possibility of a junction between the two Russian\r\nfleets, severely limited the area of Kamimura's activity. In these\r\ncircumstances Admiral Skrydloff's cruisers had an almost uncheckered\r\nrun of success for a period of two months. The Japanese Admiral came in\r\nfor some sharp criticism at the hands of the general public in Japan\r\nfor his apparent lack of energy, but the authorities at Tokio, who had\r\nall the conditions of the campaign before them in their true\r\nproportions, trusted him thoroughly, and their trust was magnificently\r\nvindicated on the 14th of August, when he at last managed to trap the\r\nRussians into his net, and administered to them a signal defeat in a\r\npitched battle on the high seas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Approaching Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nA return must now be made to the land operations upon the Liao-tung\r\nPeninsula. Undeterred by the loss of the _Hatsuse_ and the _Yoshino_,\r\nthe Japanese continued to pour in troops at Yentoa Bay and Pitszewo. At\r\nthe same time the 3rd Army, under General Nodzu, began to disembark at\r\nTakushan. But it was to General Oku and the 2nd Army that the honor\r\nfell of striking the next blow for the Mikado. This was the capture of\r\nKinchau and the storming of the Russian entrenchments on Nanshan Hill,\r\nwhich, after preliminary operations lasting over some days, was finally\r\neffected on the 26th of May.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of Nanshan]\r\n\r\nThe narrow neck of land, a mile and three-quarters in breadth, running\r\nbetween Kinchau Bay on the west and Hand Bay--a small inlet of\r\nTalienwan Bay--on the east, possesses great strategical importance. The\r\nhigh ground to the south of it, of which the salient point is the\r\nNanshan Hill, completely commands the approach to Port Arthur from the\r\nnorth, and, as it cannot be outflanked by any ordinary method, it gives\r\nan admirable opportunity, to a defending force to resist an attack from\r\nthat quarter. It is, indeed, commanded in its turn by an eminence\r\ncalled Mount Sampson, which lies to the northeast; but in this instance\r\nthe disadvantage was more than counterbalanced by the fact that the\r\nJapanese could only oppose to the heavy fortress guns which the\r\nRussians had mounted on Nanshan, field artillery of an inferior\r\ncalibre. After the landing of the enemy at Yentoa and the cutting of\r\nthe railway had made clear the imminence of the peril which threatened\r\nPort Arthur, the governor of the fortress, General Stoessel, wasted no\r\ntime in erecting powerful defences at this naturally strong position.\r\nDuring the ensuing weeks the Russian engineers went feverishly to work\r\nconstructing entrenchments on Nanshan and the connecting chains of\r\nhills, and also on a second line of eminences further to the south, the\r\nchief of which is named Nankuenling. These careful preparations might\r\nwell seem to have rendered the position impregnable. Ten forts almost\r\npermanent in character were established on Nanshan, and at every\r\navailable point trenches and rifle pits were dug and concealed with the\r\ngreatest skill, and their approaches guarded by barbed wire\r\nentanglements, while at convenient places mines were laid to entrap an\r\nunwary foe. Over 70 guns, many of them pieces of fortress artillery of\r\nheavy calibre, were placed in position here, and the whole was manned\r\nby a force of 12,000 men; the utmost number of troops that could with\r\nadvantage be employed in such a confined area. Altogether, with the\r\nexception of Port Arthur itself, no more formidable obstacle has ever\r\nbeen presented to the advance of an invading army in modern times than\r\nwas offered by General Stoessel at Kinchau. The village of Kinchau\r\nitself, it should be explained, though it gave the name to the battle,\r\nwas of comparatively small strategical importance, lying as it does on\r\nthe low ground to the northeast of the isthmus and offering an easy\r\nprey, but at the same time no particular advantage, to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan Dispositions]\r\n\r\nThe concentration of the Japanese army proceeded in the circumstances\r\nwith great rapidity. On the 21st of May, the whole force, consisting of\r\nthree divisions, or about 60,000 men, was established to the north of\r\nHand Bay. Under the protection of the angle formed by the range of\r\nhills to the south of Mount Sampson, the troops were formed up for\r\nbattle, and General Oku explained to his chief subordinates his\r\ndispositions for the attack. Careful reconnaissances during the next\r\ntwo days, by drawing the fire of the enemy, revealed the strength of\r\nthe Russian position, which stretched from Nanshan to the west to\r\nHushangtao on the east. At this latter point eight guns were stationed,\r\ncommanding the waters of Hand Bay, so that co-operation by the Japanese\r\ngunboats from this side was impossible. On the other hand, the Russians\r\nhad a gunboat themselves stationed in the bay, and this was able to\r\nrender valuable assistance to the defending force when the attack\r\ndeveloped. On the west the waters of Kinchau Bay were too shallow to\r\nadmit of the approach of vessels of any but the smallest draught, but\r\nfour of the Japanese gunboats were able to enter close up to the shore,\r\nand gave conspicuous aid to General Oku in the course of the operations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Oku's Attack]\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May the Russian positions at Kinchau and Nanshan were\r\nheavily bombarded, and General Oku extended his line to the north as\r\nwell as to the east. At dawn on the next day the attack began in\r\nearnest. A fierce and sustained bombardment, lasting for five hours,\r\nprepared the way for the advance, after which the Japanese made an\r\nonslaught upon the village of Kinchau, and drove the Russians at the\r\npoint of the bayonet back upon their main line of defence, Nanshan. In\r\nthis attack they were greatly assisted by the gunboats, the _Tsukushi_,\r\n_Saiyen_, _Akagi_ and _Chiokai_, which brought their fire to bear upon\r\nthe enemy's batteries at Suchiatun and Nanshan, and kept them hotly\r\nengaged. The capture of Kinchau, however, was only the first step in\r\nthe fiery progress which lay before the Mikado's troops. To dislodge\r\nthe Russians from Nanshan itself was a work of much greater magnitude.\r\nIt was to the 4th Division that the main part of this honorable duty\r\nwas assigned, the centre of the Japanese line being held by the 1st\r\nDivision, and the extreme left by the 3rd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrific Carnage]\r\n\r\nAnother fierce artillery duel preluded the general advance. By 11\r\no'clock the Russian batteries appeared to have been silenced, and the\r\nJapanese pressed forward to storm the heights. But it turned out that\r\nGeneral Stoessel was only reserving his fire. No sooner did the\r\nJapanese debouch into the open upon the slopes which led up to the hill\r\nthan a storm of missiles swept across their path, mowing them down in\r\nserried masses. The wire entanglements, too, proved a deadly obstacle.\r\nRush after rush was made by the gallant Japanese, but every attempt to\r\nget near to the trenches was vain. The carnage was terrific. The\r\nofficers fell in all directions, the rank and file lay in piles of dead\r\nat the foot of the hill, and the advance came for a time to an absolute\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A General Bombardment]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that further artillery preparation was necessary, and\r\ntherefore General Oku ordered a general bombardment once more. For\r\nhours his field batteries, supplemented by the gunboats, rained shot\r\nand shell upon the Russian positions, searching the whole range of\r\nforts and trenches, and doing terrible execution. The Russian fire\r\nslackened under this fearful cannonade, but still the Japanese\r\ncontinued their bombardment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chances of Defeat]\r\n\r\nAnd now came the crucial moment of the day. The artillery ammunition of\r\nthe attacking force began to give out. To bring up fresh supplies from\r\nfar in the rear meant that before the bombardment could be resumed\r\nnight would have fallen upon the scene, for it was by this time late in\r\nthe afternoon. When this untoward intelligence was brought to him,\r\nGeneral Oku was presented with a problem of the utmost difficulty and a\r\nresponsibility which might well have seemed overwhelming. He must\r\neither hazard another infantry attack at once, fraught with all the\r\npossibility of failure, or he must temporarily withdraw his forces and\r\nwait for further ammunition and perhaps heavier guns. The second course\r\nmeant only delay; the first, in the event of a repulse, meant not\r\nmerely delay, but the possibility of a crushing defeat as well. It must\r\nbe remembered, moreover, that the troops had been close upon sixteen\r\nhours in the field. In these circumstances a commander of less\r\nresolution and with less confidence in his men would have been under a\r\nstrong temptation to choose the alternative which offered the smaller\r\nrisk, but General Oku was made of different mettle. He knew that delay\r\nwould upset the general arrangements of the campaign; he knew, too,\r\nthat it might give a fatal opportunity for the advance of a relief\r\nforce from the north. He therefore at once accepted the tremendous\r\nresponsibility of ordering a resumption of the attack all along the\r\nline. Fortunately, a weak point in the Russian defences had been\r\ndiscovered. The shallow waters of Kinchau Bay allowed men to wade in\r\nand approach Nanshan from the southwest, at a point at which, owing to\r\nthe angle of emplacement of the Russian guns, they could do\r\ncomparatively little damage to an advancing force. It was resolved to\r\ntry this plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIANS CHARGING JAPANESE TRENCHES AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rushing the Trenches]\r\n\r\nOnce again, then, the bugles rang out for attack, and the Japanese\r\nthrew themselves with desperate bravery upon the Russian entrenchments.\r\nThe wire entanglements gave as much difficulty as ever, and the slopes\r\nof the hill were one blinding sheet of flame; but still the Japanese\r\npressed forward, climbing over their own dead and working their way\r\ngradually through the obstacles placed in their path. By a piece of\r\ngood fortune the electric wires connected with a large mine field were\r\ndiscovered just in time and cut, and thus a dreadful disaster was\r\naverted. But brilliant as was the dash of the 1st and 3rd Divisions on\r\nthe Russian right, the defence of the Czar's troops was stubborn and\r\nhardly contested, and it was not till the 4th Division on the extreme\r\nleft had carried through their flanking operation that the issue of the\r\nday was put beyond doubt. Here the gunboats in the bay rendered\r\ninvaluable service. They steamed close in and poured in a heavy fire\r\nupon the Russian batteries, covering the advance of the infantry\r\nthrough the shallows. In this gallant operation the commander of the\r\n_Chiokai_, Captain Hayashi, was killed, and several other casualties\r\nwere sustained by the crews engaged. But the work was accomplished.\r\nClimbing the hill like cats, the Japanese soldiery broke through the\r\nentanglements in face of a galling fire and rushed the trenches,\r\nbayonetting the defenders where they stood. Nothing could stop that mad\r\nonslaught, and after a fierce hand-to-hand conflict on the summit the\r\nflag of the Rising Sun floated triumphantly over the position which the\r\nRussians had so fondly, and indeed so naturally, deemed to be\r\nimpregnable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russians in Flight]\r\n\r\nGeneral Stoessel, finding that there was no use in continuing the\r\nsanguinary conflict now that his flank was turned, ordered a general\r\nretreat. The Japanese, however, in spite of the tremendous fatigues to\r\nwhich they had already been subjected since dawn, fiercely pursued\r\ntheir retiring enemy, with the result that the Russians found it\r\nimpossible to make a stand at their second line of defence at\r\nNankuenling, and were compelled to flee as far as the immediate\r\nneighborhood of Port Arthur itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tremendous Moral Effect]\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of this great victory of the Japanese was tremendous.\r\nThe Russians, and with them a great many Continental critics, had\r\nattempted to minimize the importance of the battle of the Yalu. The\r\nJapanese, they said, were in overwhelming numbers, the position was one\r\nthat could be easily turned, and General Sassulitch ought never to have\r\ntried to stand his ground. But such criticisms were silenced by\r\nKinchau. The little Japs were seen to be equal, if not superior, man\r\nfor man, to their Russian opponents, and the fierce, almost fanatical,\r\nfervor of their patriotism proved a factor in the struggle the\r\nimportance of which few people had properly estimated. It was felt at\r\nonce by military men in Europe, that if 12,000 Russians, armed with\r\nheavy guns, could not hold such a post as that of Nanshan against the\r\nonslaught of the Japanese, the fall of Port Arthur itself, provided\r\nthere were no effective diversion from the north, was merely a question\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terrific Casualties]\r\n\r\nNor were the material fruits of General Oku's success less striking.\r\nHis losses in _personnel_, of course, were heavy, amounting to 133\r\nofficers, and 4,062 non-commissioned officers and men killed and\r\nwounded. The casualties of the defenders were naturally not so great,\r\nbut over 500 Russians were left dead upon the field, and it is\r\nestimated that their total losses in killed and wounded must have\r\nnumbered over 2,000. Sixty-eight pieces of artillery and ten\r\nmachine-guns fell into the hands of the victors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER FOUR MONTHS.\r\n\r\nContinuing their advance, the first Japanese Army, under Kuroki\r\noccupied Kuan-tien on May 14. In the meantime the second Japanese Army,\r\nunder Oku, had effected a landing on the Liaotung Peninsula at Pitzuwo.\r\nOn May 16 they seized the Kinchau heights, and ten days later defeated\r\nthe Russians at the battle of Nanshan. Dalny was occupied on May 30.\r\nThe third Japanese Army, under Nodzu, began landing at Takushan on May\r\n19, and on June 8 occupied Siu-yen.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\nFour days afterwards the Japanese entered Dalny and occupied that\r\nimportant station. With the exception of the great pier, all those\r\nenormous works upon which the Russians had been expending vast sums for\r\nyears were found to be intact, and the invaders were able henceforth to\r\nuse the port as an invaluable base for their operations against Port\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alarm in St. Petersburg]\r\n\r\nThis series of disasters caused the greatest alarm in St. Petersburg.\r\nThe seriousness of the danger that threatened Port Arthur was realized\r\nin all its fulness at last, and the lofty assurance which had hitherto\r\nreigned supreme among the Imperial _entourage_ gave place to feelings\r\nof panic. The result was that desperate measures were embarked upon\r\nwhich only led to fresh misfortunes. General Kuropatkin himself had\r\nseen from the first the impossibility of relieving Port Arthur from the\r\nnorth until he had a larger force at his disposal than he was likely to\r\nsecure for months to come. His plan had always been to concentrate his\r\nmain army at Liao-yang, or, if necessary, at Mukden, and wait till the\r\narrival of large reinforcements enabled him to advance against the\r\nJapanese with some hope of success. If the Commander-in-Chief had been\r\nleft to himself it is possible that this plan would have been pursued\r\nconsistently and a great _debacle_ might have been avoided. Port\r\nArthur, indeed, would have been almost certain to fall, but in the\r\nopinion of nearly every strategist who had studied the problem, nothing\r\nshort of a miracle could now save the so-called Gibraltar of the East.\r\nThe only sound policy for the Russians was one of retirement and\r\nconcentration until a more favorable opportunity presented itself. But\r\nnow the Evil Genius of Russia interposed with his fatal counsels. To\r\nAdmiral Alexeieff it was unthinkable that Port Arthur, at which for so\r\nlong he had held his haughty Viceregal state, should be abandoned\r\nwithout a mighty effort. Ever since the arrival of General Kuropatkin\r\nin Manchuria had reduced him to a position of comparative inferiority,\r\nhe had been intriguing against that commander with varying success, but\r\non this occasion he received powerful backing amongst the Czar's\r\nadvisers in St. Petersburg. The heaviest pressure was brought to bear\r\nupon General Kuropatkin to induce him to dispatch a strong force\r\nsouthwards to the relief of Port Arthur, and in an evil hour for his\r\ncountry and his own reputation the Commander-in-Chief weakly consented\r\nto be overruled. Lieut.-General Baron Stackelberg, the commander of the\r\n1st Army Corps, with an army 35,000 strong was ordered to advance by\r\nforced marches into the Liao-tung Peninsula and lead a forlorn hope to\r\nsave the doomed fortress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN PRIEST IN THE TRENCHES, WITH GENERAL\r\nSTAKELBERG'S ARMY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fatal Russian Strategy]\r\n\r\nThe folly of this course is obvious to the veriest tyro in military\r\nscience. Kuropatkin's line was already too far extended for safety. On\r\nhis left flank, creeping gradually closer and working round to the\r\nnortheast to effect a wide turning movement, was General Kuroki, with\r\nthe 1st Army; General Nodzu, with the 3rd Army, was advancing from\r\nTakushan in the direction of Kaichau; while in the extreme south\r\nGeneral Oku, having received large reinforcements, was able to hold\r\nPort Arthur securely invested and to march northwards with forces\r\nnumbering 60,000 men, flushed with recent victory. The southward march\r\nof Baron Stackelberg, therefore, was doomed to disaster from the first.\r\nNot only was it highly improbable that he would ever succeed in getting\r\nthrough to Port Arthur, but in case he had to retreat, he ran a grave\r\nrisk of being cut off by General Nodzu, and imperilling the position of\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin himself. This was exactly what happened in actual\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Old Tactics versus New]\r\n\r\nThe ill-fated expedition, after some preliminary skirmishing, met\r\nGeneral Oku's main body at Wafangkau or Telissu on the 15th of June.\r\nTelissu is a village situated to the east of the railway line about 20\r\nmiles north of Port Adams. Nothing could better prove the superiority\r\nof the Japanese over the Russians in the matter of tactics than the\r\ndispositions which were made for this battle by Oku and Stackelberg\r\nrespectively. Kuropatkin's lieutenant fought in the old-fashioned\r\nstyle, with his men closely packed together over a narrow front. The\r\nJapanese, on the other hand, advanced in an open formation over a\r\nwidely extended area. At dawn General Oku ordered his troops to attack.\r\nThey advanced in two columns, the main body proceeding along the\r\nrailway line against the enemy's centre and right, while a second and\r\nmore mobile force worked round to the west to turn Stackelberg's right\r\nflank. The Russians threw themselves fiercely upon the Japanese right\r\nand centre, and for some hours the battle was hotly contested. But in\r\nthe meantime the turning movement to the west was proceeding with\r\nentire success. Before he realized the imminence of the danger,\r\nStackelberg found that his right flank was driven in, and that his rear\r\nwas threatened. He withdrew troops from his left and centre to meet\r\nthis new danger; but it was too late, and he merely weakened his\r\nposition in one part of the field without strengthening it in another.\r\nFrom three sides the Japanese now pressed their attack home, gradually\r\nencircling the Russians with a ring of fire. The terrible effectiveness\r\nof Oku's artillery was borne witness to afterwards by the Russians\r\nthemselves. Their positions were heaped with dead. General Stackelberg\r\nin his dispatch describing the battle said that the 3rd and 4th\r\nbatteries of the 1st Artillery Brigade were literally cut to pieces by\r\nthe Japanese shells, and thirteen out of sixteen guns were rendered\r\ncompletely useless. A large number of officers were killed, and among\r\nthe wounded was Major-General Gerngross. In spite of this tremendous\r\npounding the Russians held their ground with great gallantry; but, as\r\nthe Japanese attack developed, General Stackelberg saw that if he\r\nmaintained his position much longer, he would be altogether surrounded.\r\nTherefore, just in the nick of time, he ordered a retreat. Slowly and\r\npainfully the retirement was conducted over difficult, mountainous\r\ncountry. The Japanese, exhausted by forced marches and two days'\r\nfighting, were unable to cut off Stackelberg's escape entirely, but\r\nthey inflicted terrible losses on his retreating troops, and he only\r\nsucceeded in reaching Kaichau some days afterwards with a shattered\r\nremnant of his force. The Japanese casualties in this great battle were\r\nnot more than 1,000. On the other hand, upwards of 2,000 Russians were\r\nfound dead upon the field and buried by the victors, and the total\r\nlosses sustained by General Stackelberg's army, including prisoners\r\ntaken, amounted to about 10,000. Large numbers of guns and regimental\r\ncolors were captured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Veil over the Tragedy]\r\n\r\nThus ended this ill-advised attempt to relieve Port Arthur. Henceforth\r\nall hopes of succor from the north had to be abandoned. In fact,\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin, instead of being able to render assistance to the\r\nbeleaguered garrison, was himself threatened with irremediable\r\ndisaster, largely in consequence of this ill-fated operation. And now\r\nfor upwards of two months almost complete darkness fell upon the\r\ntragedy that was being enacted round the doomed fortress. Rumors\r\nreached the outer world from time to time of the sanguinary combats by\r\nwhich the besiegers slowly fought their way nearer and nearer to the\r\nheart of the stronghold; but rumors they remained; and the Japanese,\r\ntrue to their policy of silence while important events were in\r\nprogress, allowed no authentic news to percolate through the\r\ncensorship. At last, however, the veil was partially lifted. When in\r\nthe early days of August the Russian fleet, threatened with ignoble\r\ndestruction by the fire of the rapidly approaching batteries of the\r\nJapanese, made an unsuccessful dash for freedom, it was recognized on\r\nall hands that the end was near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL NOGI BEFORE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  Secrecy of Japanese Strategy--The Geographical\r\n    Position--Kuropatkin's Essential Weakness--Rain Stops\r\n    Carnage--Oku Rolls up the Russians--Field-Marshal\r\n    Oyama--Keller's Failure--10th Regiment Ambushed--Desperate\r\n    Courage against Overwhelming Odds--Kuroki again on the\r\n    Offensive--Capture of Niuchwang--The Bloodiest Fight so\r\n    Far--The Death of Count Keller--Kuropatkin's Heavy\r\n    Loss--Concentration at Liao-yang--Kuropatkin's Urgent\r\n    Motives--Oyama's Great Resources--Twelve Days' Battle--The\r\n    Great Armies in Touch--Frightful Scene of Carnage--Costly but\r\n    Indecisive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secrecy of Japanese Strategy]\r\n\r\nThe signal defeat of the Russian army under General Stackelberg at\r\nTelissu on the 15th June cleared the way for an advance northwards by\r\nGeneral Oku's army. It was one of the consequences of the secrecy which\r\nattended the Japanese strategy from first to last that until this\r\nmoment General Oku's real objective was not guessed either by foreign\r\nobservers or even by the Russians themselves. The general impression\r\nwas, naturally, that the Second Army was destined for the tremendous\r\ntask of storming Port Arthur, but a much larger conception of the\r\ncampaign was present to the minds of the strategists at Tokio. Fresh\r\ntroops in large numbers were poured into the Liao-tung Peninsula, and\r\nthese, under the command of General Nogi were concentrated round Port\r\nArthur, while the main body of the Second Army was pushed northwards to\r\nact in co-operation with the First Army of General Kuroki and the Third\r\nArmy commanded by General Nodzu, which, it will be remembered, had by\r\nthis time landed at Takushan and was being gradually directed upon\r\nHaicheng. As soon, therefore, as his forces had been restored after\r\ntheir tremendous exertions at Telissu, General Oku set out with all\r\npossible rapidity along the line of railway towards Kaiping. And now\r\nKuroki's long wait at Feng-hwang-cheng came to an end. It had, however,\r\nbeen well utilized. Not only had it enabled the conqueror of the Yalu\r\nto concentrate an army of upwards of 100,000 men, but in the interval\r\nhis engineers had been employed in constructing defences, of a\r\nsemi-permanent character, which, in the event of a subsequent retreat\r\nbeing rendered necessary, would make the position almost impregnable\r\nagainst Russian attack. But on the 23rd June General Kuroki broke camp,\r\nand, leaving behind him only a rear guard, took the first step in that\r\ngreat series of operations which, as they advanced northwards, stained\r\nthe fertile plains of Southern Manchuria with the blood of Japanese and\r\nMuscovite alike and culminated around Liao-yang and Mukden in the most\r\nterrific and sanguinary conflicts experienced in the annals of war\r\nsince the great struggle between the Northern and Southern States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical Position]\r\n\r\nThe key to the valley of the Liao River, it will be remembered, lies in\r\nthe three passes of Motienling, Taling, and Fenshuiling; and these were\r\nall held in force by the Russians. The first of them stands on the main\r\nroad leading from Feng-hwang-cheng to Liao-yang; the second (which must\r\nnot be confused with the pass of the same name situated north of the\r\nTaitse River at about 60 miles to the east of Liao-yang) commands the\r\nroad between Feng-hwang-cheng and Haicheng; and the third is on the\r\nroad from Siuyen to Tashichao and is about 20 miles southeast from the\r\nlatter place. The situation of the most important posts along the\r\nrailway from Mukden to Kaiping has already been indicated, but for the\r\nsake of clearness it may be repeated that Liao-yang, where General\r\nKuropatkin had concentrated his main army, stands about 40 miles south\r\nof Mukden; that 30 miles further south again is situated Haicheng; and\r\nthat an interval of 30 miles more separates that town from Kaiping, or\r\nKaichau, as it is sometimes called, Tashichao lying half-way between.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin's Essential Weakness]\r\n\r\nGeneral Nodzu's troops were now for the first time brought into action,\r\nand operated in unison with General Kuroki's army in the attack upon\r\nthe passes. A combination of most skilful movements made them masters\r\nof these important defiles within a few days of one another. In each\r\ncase the tactics were the same. A frontal attack was pushed forward by\r\none division, while strong bodies were sent round both to the right and\r\nleft, and, securing ground from which they could enfilade the Russian\r\ntrenches, rendered the position untenable by the defending force.\r\nGeneral surprise was felt at the ineffective stand made here by General\r\nKuropatkin's troops, especially as they had spent at least three months\r\nin building entrenchments, protected by wire entanglements and all the\r\naccessories of modern scientific warfare. The fact was, however, that\r\nthe essential weakness of Kuropatkin's army in point of numbers\r\ncompared with its opponents was now made disastrously apparent, and in\r\nspite of the natural and artificial strength of these passes, he could\r\nnot prevent the superior force which the Japanese invariably contrived\r\nto bring against him at any given point from turning his flanks. Both\r\nthe Taling Pass and the Motienling Pass, at the latter of which General\r\nCount Keller, who had superseded General Sassulitch in his command,\r\ndirected the Russian operations, fell an easy prey to Kuroki's\r\nmanoeuvres; but at Fenshuiling General Nodzu met with fierce\r\nopposition. The defile was defended by fourteen battalions of infantry\r\nand three regiments of cavalry, supported by thirty guns, and a severe\r\nengagement took place, lasting for six hours. It was apparent that the\r\nstrength of the Russian entrenchments was such that a direct attack\r\nwould involve an enormous sacrifice of life; but after brilliant\r\ntactics, carried out during the night of the 26th June and the early\r\nmorning of the 27th, the Japanese outflanked their enemy and drove them\r\nback in full retreat down the road to Simucheng, leaving ninety dead\r\nupon the field and losing eighty-eight prisoners, including six\r\nofficers. On the same day a force of three battalions with sixteen guns\r\nmade a desperate effort to recapture the position, but they were hurled\r\nback with heavy loss, and the pass remained irrevocably in the hands of\r\nthe Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rain Stops the Carnage]\r\n\r\nAt this stage in the advance further progress was delayed for a few\r\ndays by an agency which at frequent intervals during the campaign rose\r\nsuperior to the fiercest energy on the part of either combatant. The\r\nweather, which renders war in Manchuria practically impossible in\r\nwinter, succeeds in giving it an intermittent character even in summer,\r\nand now heavy rains brought the operations to a temporary standstill.\r\nThe Japanese who were on the high ground overlooking the valleys did\r\nnot suffer so much from the torrential downpour, but the Russians in\r\nthe plains had to bear its full force, and all movements by any arm of\r\nthe service were rendered impossible by a sea of mud. By the 4th of\r\nJuly, however, the rains had stopped, and on that day a sharp fight\r\ntook place at Motien-ling. During a dense fog at dawn, two battalions\r\nof the Russians attacked the Japanese outposts and endeavored to force\r\nthe position. But Kuroki's soldiers were not to be surprised, and\r\nreinforcements were hurried up with all speed. Severe hand-to-hand\r\nfighting took place; but, finally, after three onslaughts by the\r\nRussians, the Japanese hurled them back in rout and pursued them for a\r\ndistance of four miles to the westward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER FIVE MONTHS.\r\n\r\nFollowing the railway northwards Oku came into touch with the\r\nretreating Russians on June 15, and inflicted upon them a crushing\r\ndefeat at the battle of Telissu. His advance was not again opposed\r\nuntil he reached Kaiping, which he captured after some fighting on July\r\n9. Meanwhile the armies under Kuroki and Nodzu had been advancing\r\nsteadily, and the Mo-tien and Fen-shui Passes, commanding the roads to\r\nLiaoyang and Haicheng, were captured simultaneously. During this month\r\nthe siege of Port Arthur began on land.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oku Rolls up Russians]\r\n\r\nTwo days later General Oku took up the running for the Japanese, and\r\nstarted to roll up the Russian forces from the south. Moving out from\r\nErh-tau-ho-tse, which is 12 miles south of Kaiping, he marched upon\r\nthat town along the road westwards of the railway, driving the enemy's\r\noutposts before him. By noon on the 9th he had forced the Russians, who\r\nwere under General Zarubaieff, Commander of the Fourth Siberian Army\r\nCorps, back upon their main position at Kaiping itself, and here it\r\nappeared that General Kuropatkin had ordered a stand to be made.\r\nUpwards of 30,000 men, with numerous guns, were in the neighborhood at\r\nthe disposal of Zarubaieff and Oku prepared for a stout resistance. But\r\nas a matter of fact the opposition offered to him turned out to be\r\ncomparatively feeble. After an artillery duel lasting for four hours\r\nhis troops advanced and seized the heights extending from Haishan-chai\r\non the west to Shwangtingshan on the east, from both of which eminences\r\nthey could command Kaiping. Reinforcements had been hurried up from the\r\nRussian rear, but they were soon ordered northward again, and the whole\r\nbody evacuated the town under cover of heavy gun fire on the afternoon\r\nof the same day. The cause of this ineffectual resistance on the part\r\nof Zarubaieff was the advance of the Third Army of Japan from\r\nFenshuiling, which acted in co-ordination throughout with General Oku's\r\ncolumns, and threatened to outflank the Russians. To avoid a great\r\ndisaster General Zarubaieff was compelled to retreat, and as a\r\nconsequence of this skilful manoeuvring, General Oku was enabled to\r\noccupy the important position of Kaiping with a loss which was almost\r\nnegligible, another big step being thus gained in the progress\r\nnorthwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Field-Marshal Oyama]\r\n\r\nOn the very day which Oku began his advance on Kaiping there occurred\r\nan event which brought strikingly before the world the fact that these\r\nmovements by the three Japanese generals were only part of one great\r\nconcerted plan, the vastness of which was not yet realized. This was\r\nthe departure from Tokio for the seat of war of Field-Marshal Marquis\r\nOyama, the master-mind selected by the Mikado for the supreme command\r\nof all his armies in the field. A brief description of the career of\r\nthis great general, whose renown in Japan is second only to that of the\r\nveteran Yamagata, will not be out of place here. Like so many of the\r\nJapanese leaders who have distinguished themselves in the present war,\r\nOyama's first experience of fighting was gained in the old days of the\r\nSumatsu rebellion, in which he took part on the revolutionary side,\r\nachieving considerable distinction for his gallantry. After peace had\r\nplaced the Mikado securely upon the throne of Japan, Oyama was sent to\r\nPrussia as military attaché, and was present at Moltke's headquarters\r\nat all the most important operations of the Franco-German War. There\r\nhe, no doubt, gained many of the valuable lessons which have since been\r\nput in force both in the Chinese War ten years ago and in the present\r\ncampaign. After the Peace of Versailles he devoted himself to a close\r\nstudy of the military organizations of France and Switzerland, and\r\nreturning to his own country in 1875 received an appointment on the\r\nGeneral Staff in Tokio. He was selected for the command of the First\r\nArmy on the outbreak of the war with China in 1894, and directed the\r\noperations around Port Arthur, which culminated in the storming of that\r\npowerful fortress. On the retirement of Marshal Yamagata from\r\nill-health, General Oyama was appointed to the chief command of all the\r\nJapanese forces in the field, and carried the campaign to a successful\r\nconclusion. After the signature of the Treaty of Peace the Mikado\r\nrecognized his great services by conferring upon him the baton of\r\nField-Marshal and appointing him Chief of the Staff. In the meanwhile,\r\nGeneral Oku was preparing for his further advance northwards, where the\r\nnext obstacle in his path was the Russian position at Tashichao. This\r\ntown had been converted into a place of great strength and was\r\ngarrisoned by at least 60,000 men with 105 guns. But before the\r\nopposing forces could meet here a fresh attack of a much more\r\ndetermined character than the last was made upon the Japanese army at\r\nMotienling, the Russians, under the command of Kuropatkin's most\r\ntrusted lieutenant, General Count Keller, making a desperate attempt to\r\nregain possession of that important defile. This was the first occasion\r\non which Kuropatkin's troops seriously assumed the offensive in the\r\ncourse of the war, and the result was a conspicuous success once more\r\nfor the Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keller's Failure]\r\n\r\nThe Russian Commander-in-Chief entrusted two divisions to Count Keller\r\nfor the purpose of the attack, and that General made dispositions for a\r\nfrontal attack along the main road from Tawan, simultaneously, with\r\nmovements against both of the Japanese flanks. For the main operation\r\none division was employed, and the other was divided into two bodies,\r\nthe first marching from Anping upon Hsimatang, where the outposts on\r\nKuroki's right were stationed; and the second pushing forward from\r\nTienshuitien along the paths which lead through the hills to the south\r\nof Motienling, where the Japanese left wing was posted. This scheme of\r\nadvance might have had some success if all the parts of the machine had\r\nworked together with complete smoothness, but in the actual event the\r\nmovements of the several columns were badly co-ordinated, and they came\r\ninto action at different times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOD FOR THE JAPANESE ARMY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 10th Regiment Ambushed]\r\n\r\nThe frontal attack began at 3 a. m., when, under cover of a dense fog,\r\nKeller's two leading battalions fell upon the Japanese outpost upon the\r\nmain road some distance to the west of the pass. Notwithstanding the\r\nshock of the surprise and the formidable disparity of numbers, Kuroki's\r\ntroops held their ground with the utmost gallantry. The foremost files\r\nof the 10th Siberian Regiment became engaged almost at once in a\r\nhand-to-hand combat with a small body of about thirty or forty\r\nJapanese. Several of the latter were bayonetted before they realized\r\nthat the enemy was upon them, but the survivors, taking refuge among\r\nsome Chinese cottages, made a desperate resistance with rifle and cold\r\nsteel. The din and the crack of musketry aroused some companies who\r\nwere bivouacking in the neighboring trenches, and they quickly rushed\r\nto the support of their comrades. One company, taking up a position in\r\nan adjacent temple, poured in a murderous fire upon the Russians, and\r\nanother stationed itself on a hill on the opposite side and joined in\r\nthe deadly fusillade. Thus the 10th Regiment, instead of successfully\r\nsurprising its foe, found itself in turn surprised in an ambush, and\r\nafter a hot engagement was compelled to retreat back upon its main\r\nbody. It was five o'clock before the Russians could bring up a\r\nsufficient force to drive in the Japanese outposts, by which time the\r\ngallant stand made by these few companies had enabled Kuroki's troops\r\nentrenched at the Motien Pass itself to prepare fully for the onslaught\r\nthat awaited them. When Keller's soldiery, therefore, came within range\r\nof the Japanese lines, they were met by a heavy fire both from infantry\r\nand artillery. Two hours more elapsed before they were properly\r\ndisposed for the attack, and then, although they consisted of a whole\r\ndivision of 12,000 men, and were opposed by a force of no more than\r\n4,000, their tactics proved quite ineffective, and they could not\r\nsucceed in the slightest degree in shaking the hold upon the defile\r\nwhich their enemy had gained.\r\n\r\nThe fire which was directed upon them from the Japanese lines was\r\nespecially galling upon their left wing, and here, shortly before\r\neleven o'clock, they began to give way, and ere long the whole force\r\nfell back in retreat. Their active enemy then sprang forward to the\r\nattack themselves and attempted to push the repulse home, but a strong\r\nrear guard held them in check, and prevented the reverse from becoming\r\na rout. It afterwards became apparent that the reason for this retreat\r\non the part of Count Keller's main body was the complete failure of the\r\nflanking movements which he had presumably intended to be conducted\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desperate Courage but Overwhelming Odds]\r\n\r\nBut the attack upon their outposts upon the main road at three in the\r\nmorning had put the whole Japanese army upon the _qui vive_, and both\r\non the right and the left flanks preparations were made to meet such a\r\nmanoeuvre as the Russian General had in view. On the left wing, as no\r\nenemy had appeared in sight by five o'clock, a company of the Japanese\r\npushed forward towards Makumenza to wait for their approach. There it\r\nfell in with a Russian battalion and engaged it at once in a hot\r\nconflict. A second battalion came to the aid of the first, and for a\r\ntime the little force of Japanese was in danger of being annihilated,\r\nbut reinforcements quickly arrived, and though they were still\r\nnumerically weaker than the Russians, they drove them back with heavy\r\nloss, and occupied the heights which commanded the approach from this\r\npoint, completing the confusion of the enemy by directing a galling\r\nfire upon the main body which was now in full retreat along the road to\r\nTawan. On the right flank the struggle was more obstinate and\r\nsanguinary. When the attack began at eight o'clock the Japanese were\r\ngreatly outnumbered, and for a time one company had to hold its own\r\nagainst the onslaught of a whole battalion of the Russians, supported\r\nby a troop of cavalry. In the deadly conflict which ensued, every one\r\nof the Japanese officers fell upon the field, but notwithstanding their\r\nterrible losses the little band fought on with desperate courage\r\nagainst the overwhelming odds. The arrival of another Russian battalion\r\nseemed to threaten their complete destruction, but, fortunately, before\r\nlong reinforcements were hurried up to the spot and the contest became\r\nmore even. After a severe conflict, lasting for eight and a half hours,\r\nthe Russians at length gave up the attempt to force the Japanese lines\r\nas hopeless, and fell back broken and defeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING TERRITORY ADJACENT TO LIAOYANG.]\r\n\r\nThus at every point this attack, from which General Kuropatkin had\r\nhoped for so much, failed completely, and the superiority of the\r\nJapanese soldiery over their opponents was once more strikingly\r\nmanifested. Kuroki's casualties amounted to about 300 killed and\r\nwounded, but the affair was much more expensive to the Russians,\r\nGeneral Keller putting his losses at over 1,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin Again on the Offensive]\r\n\r\nImmediately following upon this success, General Kuroki once again\r\nassumed the offensive and captured the position of Hsihoyen,\r\npractically the last stronghold occupied by the Russians on the high\r\nground overlooking the plains of the Liao River. This success was the\r\nwork of the Twelfth Division, that division which, it will be\r\nremembered, decided the battle of the Yalu by its flank attack on\r\nGeneral Kashtalinsky's left. It now covered itself with fresh glory\r\nunder its skilful commander, General Nishi. The same tactics as had\r\nbeen adopted in all these operations against the strongly entrenched\r\npositions of the Russians were once more employed. The enemy were kept\r\nbusy with a frontal attack while a column marched around their right\r\nflank and rendered their carefully prepared stronghold untenable. A\r\ngeneral advance was then made, and the Russians were driven back upon\r\nAnping in complete rout with more than 1,000 casualties. The Japanese\r\nkilled and wounded amounted only to half that number.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July, Oku resumed his advance northwards and attacked\r\nthe powerful Russian position at Tashichao. The skilful handling of\r\nZarubaieff's large force of artillery made it impossible for the\r\nJapanese to carry the trenches by daylight, but, waiting till\r\nnightfall, they made a fresh onslaught under the beams of a full moon.\r\nPoint after point fell into their hands, and next morning General\r\nZarubaieff, feeling the hopelessness of continuing the defence,\r\nespecially in view of a fresh movement by General Nodzu's army which\r\nthreatened his left, decided to retreat. This unexpectedly easy victory\r\nwas gained by the Japanese at the expense of about 1,000 casualties;\r\nbut the Russians lost twice that number of men, and among the wounded\r\nwere two officers of high rank, Generals Kondratovitch and Skaloff. Two\r\ndays later a detachment of Oku's army entered Yinkow, the port of\r\nNiuchwang--a highly important prize, for it provided the invaders with\r\na new and most valuable base for the advance from the south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Niuchwang]\r\n\r\nOn July 31st the advance was resumed all along the line of the extended\r\nfront of the Japanese, and each of the three armies was hotly engaged.\r\nOku's steady march along the line of the railway drove the retreating\r\nenemy into Haicheng. On the right, at Tomucheng, a more sanguinary\r\nbattle took place between General Nodzu's army and two divisions of\r\nRussian infantry, supported by seven batteries of artillery, under the\r\ncommand of General Alexeieff. The Russians occupied a strongly\r\nentrenched position on the hills to the north of Tomucheng, the work of\r\nfortification having occupied several months. But the result was the\r\nsame here as in every quarter of the theatre of war. The two armies\r\nwere locked together in a deadly struggle for nearly the whole of a\r\nscorching day, until the Japanese left wing, attacking with desperate\r\nbravery, carried the heights opposite to them and threatened the rear\r\nof the Russian centre. During the night, therefore, General Alexeieff\r\nfell back, leaving more than 150 dead upon the field and abandoning six\r\nguns, which fell into the hands of the enemy. The result of these\r\ncombined operations of the Second and Third Armies was that Haicheng\r\nwas occupied on August 3rd, and Niuchwang--which must be distinguished\r\nfrom the port of the same name--also fell into Oku's grasp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bloodiest Fight so Far]\r\n\r\nIt was in the north, however, with the Japanese First Army that the\r\nbloodiest fighting ensued, and that the Russians met with the most\r\nsignal defeat. On July 31st Kuroki's right wing held Kushulintzu, 4\r\nmiles to the west of Hsihoyen, and his centre occupied Yangtzuling, 6\r\nmiles to the west of Motienling, both places being situated about 25\r\nmiles from Liao-yang. Opposite to Kushulintzu the Russians, who held a\r\nvery strong position on the high ground, consisted of two divisions of\r\ninfantry with well-placed artillery. The attack began at dawn and\r\ncontinued all day. The Japanese infantry advanced gradually across the\r\nopen valley undeterred by the murderous fire poured upon them from the\r\nRussian batteries, and threw themselves recklessly upon the enemy's\r\nredoubts. It was on the wings that the Russian defence was the weakest,\r\nand here, by sunset, the impetuous onslaught of the Mikado's troops\r\ncarried all before it, nightfall finding them in possession of some of\r\nthe most important heights. But the strength of the Russian centre was\r\ntoo great to be forced easily, and the Japanese therefore bivouacked on\r\nthe field, and waited till daybreak to resume the attack. With the\r\nfirst rays of dawn they were ready once more for the fray, and again\r\nthe hills resounded with the roar of artillery. For several hours the\r\nbattle raged, the Russians making a most obstinate defence, but as the\r\nJapanese captured height after height the enemy could stand their\r\nground no longer, and by noon they broke and fled westwards, leaving\r\nseveral field guns behind in the victor's hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER SIX MONTHS.\r\n\r\nKuroki and Nodzu now called a halt to enable Oku to come into line with\r\nthem. The latter, working his way steadily northwards, drove the\r\nRussians out of Tashichiao after three days' severe fighting. Newchwang\r\nwas occupied on July 25, and Nodzu, having advanced his forces to\r\nSi-mu-cheng and driven out the Russians on July 30, the two generals\r\njoined forces and marched on Haicheng, which they occupied on August 2.\r\nA general assault was delivered on Port Arthur on July 26, and a few\r\ndays later the Japanese captured Wolf Hill, Green Hill, and Takushan.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Death of Count Keller]\r\n\r\nAt Yangtzuling the conflict was even more severe. The Russian force\r\nhere consisted of two and a half divisions, with four batteries of\r\nartillery, and General Count Keller commanded in person. It was\r\ndestined to be that gallant but unfortunate officer's last fight, for\r\nhe fell mortally wounded in the course of the second day's operations.\r\nThe Japanese plan of attack was very much the same as in the case of\r\nKushulintzu. In spite of the tropical sun, whose rays beat upon their\r\nheads without protection, their advance was irresistible, and throwing\r\nthemselves upon the enemy with a fierce _elan_, which carried all\r\nbefore it, they captured some of the principal positions by the close\r\nof the day. Here again, however, a numerous body of Russians held out\r\nin the centre against the most desperate attacks, and the Japanese were\r\ntherefore compelled to bivouac on the field for the night and resume\r\nthe conflict on the succeeding day. The dawn opened with a terrific\r\nartillery duel between the opposing batteries, and all the morning the\r\nguns belched forth flame and death. It was in the course of this\r\ntremendous bombardment that Count Keller met with his death. He was a\r\nman of reckless courage, and he insisted on taking his stand to direct\r\nthe operations in a battery which was most heavily exposed to the fire\r\nof Kuroki's guns. So fiercely did the shells fall all around that his\r\nstaff represented to him that he must be the object himself of the\r\nenemy's cannonade, but he refused to retire to a less exposed position.\r\nHe had hardly dismounted from his horse when a shrapnel shell burst\r\nwithin a few paces from him and hurled him to the ground. A sergeant\r\nrushed up to him to raise him in his arms, but the general motioned him\r\naway and expired a few moments afterwards. His wounds were of the most\r\nterrible nature. Two fragments of shell struck him upon the head and\r\nthree others in the chest, and he had thirty-one shrapnel bullet wounds\r\nin different parts of his body. The death of their commander threw the\r\nRussians into final confusion, and they retreated in haste, leaving a\r\nnumber of field guns in Kuroki's possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF COUNT KELLER AT YANG-ZE-LING PASS.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin's Heavy Loss]\r\n\r\nThe loss of Count Keller was a particularly heavy blow to Kuropatkin,\r\nfor he was the most trusted of all his subordinates and was most deeply\r\nin the confidence of the Commander-in-Chief. His experience, too, of\r\nwar was gained in the Russo-Turkish campaign, on the staff of the same\r\nfamous leader, Skobeleff, and he actually succeeded Kuropatkin as\r\nAide-de-Camp to that General when the present Commander-in-Chief was\r\nwounded at the Shipka Pass in 1877. Besides the signal misfortune he\r\nsustained by the death of this distinguished officer, General\r\nKuropatkin had to add to his already heavy casualty list a further loss\r\nof 2,000 officers and men. It was an even more significant and\r\ndiscouraging fact, however, that among the troops opposed to the\r\nvictorious Kuroki on this occasion were the most recent accessions to\r\nthe Russian army, the 10th and 17th Corps. These forces, which came\r\nfrom European Russia and were greatly superior to the Siberian soldiery\r\nboth in physique and discipline, had been counted upon to do much to\r\nstem the tide of disaster, but though they made a better appearance\r\nthan the troops which had been in action previously, all their prowess\r\nwas unavailing against the impetuous patriotism of the Japanese, who\r\nhad by this time proved themselves to be among the finest infantry in\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concentration at Liaoyang]\r\n\r\nIt now became plain to Kuropatkin that the Japanese could not be\r\nstopped before Liao-yang itself was reached. He therefore concentrated\r\nall his available forces at that powerful and highly fortified position\r\nin preparation for a great pitched battle. During the months which had\r\nelapsed since the arrival of the Russian Commander-in-Chief at the seat\r\nof war, Liao-yang had been turned into a great place of arms. Its great\r\nnatural defensive advantages had been skilfully improved upon. Every\r\ninch of suitable ground had been carefully fortified, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt from the character of the dispositions which had been made\r\nthat Kuropatkin hoped to be able not only to make a stand here, but to\r\nhurl back the armies of the Mikado in disorder, save Southern Manchuria\r\nfor the Czar, and perhaps even march forward afterwards to the relief\r\nof the beleaguered fortress of Port Arthur.\r\n\r\nHis armies, indeed, had been tragically reduced in numbers in every\r\ncombat that had yet taken place. The arrival of the Tenth and\r\nSeventeenth Army Corps had put him in a better position; but against\r\nthis had to be set the loss of nearly 30,000 men killed or wounded\r\nsince the battle of the Yalu proved the magnitude of the task which lay\r\nbefore him. Yet he now possessed a force of about 132,000 men, with 400\r\nguns, and he held a position of enormous strength. All of his troops,\r\nindeed, had tasted the bitterness and discouragement of defeat in the\r\ncourse of the fifteen engagements which had taken place since the\r\noutbreak of the war, but he himself had not yet been present in person\r\nupon the field of battle, and he might well hope that the failure which\r\nhad attended all the efforts of his lieutenants would give place to\r\nvictory when he took the direction of affairs into his own hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin's Urgent Motives]\r\n\r\nAt all events, whatever the issue of the battle might be, there could\r\nbe no doubt that a retreat from Liao-yang without fighting was for\r\nevery reason impossible. The Court of St. Petersburg had already been\r\nrendered restive by the continual withdrawal of the main body of\r\nMuscovite armies to the north; his enemies were busy with their\r\ndetractions; and the irrepressible Alexeieff was always near to make\r\ncapital out of the difficulties, and to distort and misrepresent the\r\nactions of his abler rival. But beyond all these personal reasons,\r\npowerful enough in themselves in the eyes of a man holding such a\r\nposition as Kuropatkin, there were more worthy considerations which\r\nweighed heavily in the scale in favor of boldly submitting his fortunes\r\nto the cast of the die and risking all in one mighty struggle. The\r\nhonor of the Russian arms and the prestige of the Empire were at stake;\r\na continued retreat without a supreme effort to roll back the tide of\r\ninvasion was politically dangerous to a Dominion which owed its very\r\nexistence in the East to the preservation of a haughty and determined\r\nfront; and, more serious even than the growing restlessness of all\r\nthose Oriental races who yield unwilling allegiance to the Little White\r\nFather, was the increasing discontent in Russia itself, and the\r\nuprising once more of the forbidding spectre of Nihilism and\r\nrevolution. A pitched battle on a grand scale was, therefore, for every\r\nreason unavoidable, and, in spite of all the risks he ran, Kuropatkin\r\nfaced the prospect before him with calm courage and resolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oyama's Great Resources]\r\n\r\nThe state of things on the other side was very different. Here there\r\nwas nothing to discourage, but everything to inspire hope.\r\nField-Marshal Oyama, who had now reached the scene of operations, found\r\nat his disposal three great armies upon whose banners victory had\r\nconsistently rested during a now prolonged campaign. The organization\r\nof the whole of the forces was perfect, and though it was now far from\r\nits base, its supplies were ample and constant. The natural\r\ndifficulties of the advance were, indeed, great, but they were no\r\ngreater than those which had already been triumphantly overcome. His\r\nchief lieutenants were men of tried capacity. The subordinate officers\r\nhad proved their efficiency in tactics on many a hard-fought field, and\r\nthe rank and file were inspired, not only with a rare intelligence, but\r\nwith a fanatical patriotism, which made them, perhaps, the most\r\nformidable instruments of warfare the world has ever seen. And after\r\nall the inevitable losses of the past three months, he yet had under\r\nhis command a total field force (exclusive of the army of 100,000 men\r\nengaged in besieging Port Arthur) of 220,000 men and 600 guns. It was\r\nplain that only the most desperate resistance on the part of the\r\nRussians could prevent the crowning mercy of a great victory, and\r\nalready foreign critics were anticipating a Russian Sedan upon the\r\nbanks of the Taitse River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SIX DAYS ACTION AROUND LIAOYANG\r\n    AUG. 29TH-SEPT. 3RD.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Twelve Days' Battle]\r\n\r\nTorrential rains again delayed operations for upwards of three weeks,\r\nbut by the 24th of August comparatively dry weather had set in, and on\r\nthe 25th the general advance of the Japanese upon Liao-yang began. We\r\nnow enter upon one of the most tremendous dramas ever known in military\r\nhistory--the twelve days' battle around Liao-yang. No fighting so\r\nfierce, so sustained, and so bloody has been experienced since the\r\narmies of Grant and Lee met in their great death grapple in the\r\nWilderness in the Civil War. The terrible conflict raged for the most\r\npart simultaneously over an enormously extended front, and an adequate\r\ndescription can only be given by following in turn the fortunes of the\r\nseparate Japanese armies. But for sake of clearness it will be well to\r\nattempt, first, a brief and comprehensive account of the main lines of\r\nthe operations and their final result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Armies in Touch]\r\n\r\nOn the 25th Kuroki's army of three divisions advanced upon Anping, and,\r\nafter desperate fighting, drove the Russians back from that place to\r\nLiao-yang. At the same time the Third Army under General Nodzu,\r\nmanoeuvring with Oku's forces on the left, turned the enemy out of\r\ntheir strong position at Anshanchan, situated about 15 miles to the\r\nsouth of Liao-yang. The advance of Oku was delayed considerably by the\r\nefforts of an enterprising rear guard left by Kuropatkin to cover the\r\nretreat, and by the thick mud, which made the roads almost impassable;\r\nbut on the 29th both he and Nodzu came into touch with the enemy in\r\ntheir main position in front of Liao-yang. Here Kuropatkin held an\r\nentrenched front of about five miles, with three lines of defence\r\nformed by separate ranges of low hills, fortified with consummate skill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING ROUTE OF MARCH AND PRINCIPAL ACTIONS OF THE\r\nFOUR JAPANESE ARMIES\r\n    Feb. 7th-Sept. 4th.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frightful Carnage]\r\n\r\nTo the Japanese, however, no obstacle seemed too great. After a\r\nprolonged artillery preparation, in which for the first time the\r\nRussians showed themselves equal, if not superior, to their opponents,\r\nthe superb infantry of Dai Nippon were ordered to the attack. Then\r\nensued the most frightful scene of carnage and heroic endurance. For\r\nfive long days the splendid troops of Oku and Nodzu flung themselves\r\nupon a foe not less gallant than themselves, and time after time they\r\nwere held back with broken ranks, leaving behind great heaps of dead.\r\nAnd when at last they did make their bloody passage into the town of\r\nLiao-yang, it was only to learn the mortifying intelligence that their\r\nenemy had escaped from the toils so carefully set for him, and that for\r\na considerable time their tremendous struggle had been conducted, not\r\nwith the main body of Kuropatkin's army, but with a rear guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE ASSAULT ON A RUSSIAN POSITION AT LIAO-YANG.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Costly but Indecisive]\r\n\r\nFor those incalculable factors which so often defeat the best laid\r\nschemes of strategy had come into play, and had seriously affected the\r\nsuccess of the great move which Kuroki was endeavoring to carry out on\r\nthe Japanese right. In this case they proved to be the weather, which\r\nhad swollen the Taitse River into a flood, and a sudden display of\r\ngreat tactical ability by Kuropatkin, which his previous failures in\r\nthe sphere of strategy had led no one to expect. Upon Kuroki, of\r\ncourse, as holding the most advanced position on the Japanese right, it\r\ndepended to envelope the left flank of the Russians and cut off their\r\nretreat to the north. But, unfortunately for the success of Oyama's\r\nstrategy, the river Taitse, which runs from east to west just north of\r\nLiao-yang, and which had to be crossed by the Japanese, was so flooded\r\nthat a day or two elapsed before it could be forded, and it was not\r\ntill the 31st that Kuroki's forces were able to take up a position on\r\nthe opposite bank. It was hoped, however, that a rapid march to the\r\nnorthwest would place the commander of the First Army astride of the\r\nrailway at Yentai, and that he would thus be able to cut off\r\nKuropatkin's retreat and enclose him in another Sedan within a ring of\r\nsteel. But the delay proved fatal, for it gave Kuropatkin time to\r\nrescue his army from the perilous position in which it was placed. With\r\na skill which must always extort the admiration of military critics he\r\nwithdrew the greater part of his forces across the river in the most\r\nperfect order, unknown to the Japanese, and massed them on his left\r\nflank. The consequence was that instead of finding a division, or at\r\nthe most two divisions, opposed to him, Kuroki was faced by the greater\r\npart of the Russian Army, established in strong positions on a range of\r\nhills between himself and the railway line. It was a masterly piece of\r\ngeneralship on the part of the Russian Commander-in-Chief, and it saved\r\nthe situation. Indeed, at one point it threatened Kuroki with\r\ndestruction, for he was almost cut off from support, and for\r\ntwenty-four hours both officers and men were without either drink or\r\nfood except small rations of dried rice. But the extraordinary\r\ngallantry of the sons of Japan rose superior even to these conditions.\r\nAgain and again they advanced to the attack against powerful positions\r\nheld by superior numbers, and the salient point in the Russian defence,\r\nthe hill of Haiyentai, was heaped with the dead of the heroic\r\ncombatants. Despite every effort, however, Kuroki could not pierce the\r\nenemy's line, and it was not till a fine forced march by a division\r\ndetached from General Nodzu's army arrived to reinforce him that he was\r\nable to reach the railway after four days of tremendous combat. But by\r\nthat time it was too late. The skilful dispositions made by the Russian\r\nGeneral had pulled the bulk of his force out of the trap, and they were\r\nin full retreat upon Mukden. It would be difficult to describe the\r\nhorrors of that retreat, but the Japanese were too exhausted to make as\r\neffective a pursuit as they would otherwise have done, and the Russians\r\nmanaged to get away without losing a single piece of artillery. The\r\nlosses in this tremendous battle, or rather series of battles, were\r\nenormous. The Japanese official account places their casualties at\r\n17,539, but, if we are to believe the correspondents, that is an\r\nunderstatement. The exact Russian losses, including those incurred\r\nduring the retreat, are placed by some authorities at 25,000, by others\r\nas high as 35,000. Unfortunately for the Japanese, all this costly\r\nexpenditure of life was indecisive in its results, and left the main\r\nobject of their strategy unfulfilled. Kuropatkin had been defeated,\r\nindeed, but he had not been routed, and it was apparent that the\r\nfighting would have to be resumed once more in the neighborhood of\r\nMukden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  Investment of Port Arthur--Admiral Witoft's Sortie--Tremendous\r\n    Naval Battle--Harbors of Refuge--International\r\n    Complications--Insignificant Japanese Losses--The Last Raid\r\n    from Vladivostock--The Port Arthur Garrison--Fury Unparalleled\r\n    in History--Kuroki Improves his Reputation--The Grim Reality of\r\n    War.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closer Investment of Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nWhile the victorious armies of Oku, Kuroki, and Nodzu were pressing\r\nnorthward towards Liao-yang, driving before them the only force from\r\nwhich the beleaguered garrison of Port Arthur could look for relief,\r\nthe siege of Russia's \"impregnable fortress\" proceeded with unabated\r\ndetermination and constantly increasing vigor. It was on June 26th that\r\nthe general advance on Port Arthur began; and from that date the lines\r\nof investment were steadily drawn closer and closer. Siege trains were\r\nlanded at Dalny as well as large reinforcements, but for nearly a month\r\ncomplete silence as to the progress of events was maintained at Tokio.\r\nFrom time to time sensational and contradictory reports of desperate\r\nfighting were received from Chifu, where Chinese refugees landed in a\r\nconstant stream; and authentic messages from General Stoessel, the\r\nheroic commander of the fortress's garrison, reached the outer world at\r\nintervals through the medium of a wireless telegraphy installation at\r\nthe Russian Consulate in Chifu. Naturally, these messages were of a\r\nreassuring character, and generally recorded some repulse of the\r\nJapanese army of investment; but though no word of contradiction was\r\nuttered at Tokio, the world was hardly inclined to accept the Russian\r\nstories at their face value. When, for example, in a triumphant\r\nmessage, General Stoessel reported that a grand assault on the Russian\r\ndefences had taken place on July 26th, 27th, and 28th, and had been\r\nrepulsed at all points, with great slaughter, cautious observers of\r\nevents waited for confirmation of the news; although the Czar himself\r\nhastened to dispatch to his gallant representative in Port Arthur a\r\ntelegram of warm congratulation and praise. Hesitation was justified by\r\nthe event; for two days after their alleged decisive repulse they\r\ncaptured the dominant position of Wolf Hill, and thereby made the first\r\nimportant breach in the defences of Port Arthur. Wolf Hill is an\r\neminence half a mile south of the village of Suei-ze-ying, which is\r\nsome three and a half miles along the railway line running due north\r\nfrom Port Arthur. The importance of the captured position for the\r\nJapanese was that it enabled siege guns to command, within easily\r\neffective range, the anchorage of the Russian squadron on the inside of\r\nthe Tiger's Tail. This meant, of course, either that the fleet must go\r\nto sea and fight, or must endure impotently the hammering of the 12in.\r\nshells which soon began to drop from the batteries on Wolf's Hill.\r\nWithin a week of the capture of the position, the Japanese had mounted\r\ntheir siege guns; and after a bombardment of two days, the Russian\r\ndecision was taken to attempt another sortie. The last sortie, it will\r\nbe remembered, took place on June 23rd, and ended in the inglorious\r\nreturn of the whole fleet; as the Russian Admiral, in spite of the\r\nadvantage which, as we now know, he possessed over his enemy in battle\r\nstrength, did not dare to give battle. This decision which let slip one\r\nof the best opportunities that the Russian Pacific Squadron ever had of\r\nfavorably modifying the naval situation in the Far East, was\r\nill-received at St. Petersburg, where carefully planned dispositions\r\nwere thus brought to nought; and as soon as the contemplation of\r\nanother sortie became immediately necessary, the strictest injunctions\r\nwere sent to Admiral Witoft as to his course of action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admiral Witoft's Sortie]\r\n\r\nThe Czar emphatically ordered him on no account to return to Port\r\nArthur. His object must be to inflict as much damage as possible on the\r\nenemy's fleet, and, if possible, to effect a junction with the\r\nVladivostock Squadron; while, if the latter object were incapable of\r\naccomplishment, he was to endeavor to reach the German port of\r\nKiau-chau. From circumstances that have since transpired, there is\r\nreason to believe that an understanding had been arrived at between the\r\nGerman and Russian Governments as to the reception of the Russian ships\r\nat the German naval base. Although for the moment the Russian fugitives\r\nwould, by the laws of neutrality, be placed out of action, they would\r\nbe in the hands of a \"benevolent\" government; and would remain a factor\r\nto be reckoned with, if in the future Germany were to intervene in the\r\nsettlement of the struggle. Accordingly, on the morning of August 10th,\r\nthe Russian Squadron, in full strength except for the armored-cruiser\r\n_Bayan_, which was in too injured a condition to take its place in the\r\nfighting line, began slowly to pass through the narrow channel leading\r\nfrom the open sea; and by eleven o'clock the ships were drawn up in\r\nbattle line, and steamed away on a course nearly due south. The gallant\r\nlittle _Novik_, the fastest vessel in either fleet, headed the line,\r\nwhile the patched-up _Retvisan_ came next, followed by the\r\n_Czarevitch_, the _Peresveit_, the _Pobieda_, the _Poltava_, and the\r\n_Sevastopol_, with the cruisers _Askold_, _Diana_, and _Pallada_, and a\r\ntorpedo flotilla of eight vessels. The squadron of Japanese light\r\ncruisers which had been watching Port Arthur retreated before the\r\nadvancing enemy, and signalled at once to the sleepless Togo, whose\r\nmain battle fleet was lying forty miles away. This consisted of four\r\nbattleships and three armored cruisers--namely, the _Mikasa_, carrying\r\nAdmiral Togo's flag; the _Asahi_, the _Shikishima_, the _Fuji_, the\r\n_Nishin_, the _Kasuga_, the _Jakumo_, and a number of protected\r\ncruisers, including the _Kasagi_, the _Chitose_, the _Takasugo_, as\r\nwell as a flotilla of some forty torpedo craft. Thus the Russians had a\r\nclear superiority in battleships partially discounted by Togo's\r\nsuperiority in armored cruisers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tremendous Naval Battle]\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the southeast of Port Arthur the opposing fleets\r\ncame within range; and then began the most tremendous naval\r\nbattle--measured by the offensive power of its combatants--that the\r\nworld has yet seen. The naval world had been waiting almost with\r\neagerness for the present war to afford the spectacle of a fleet action\r\nbetween modern armorclads carrying modern armaments; and this\r\nunprecedented event had at last come to pass. The Russian ships were\r\nsteering for the south, and the object of the Japanese was evidently to\r\nhead them off. At a range of 6,000 yards, or about three miles and a\r\nhalf, the _Mikasa_, the Japanese flagship, opened fire with her 12in.\r\nguns on the leading Russian battleship and immediately the action\r\nbecame general. Admiral Togo concentrated his fire on the Russian\r\nbattleships, leaving the cruisers very much to chance; and so awful was\r\nthe effect of this deadly rain of shell, that when at last the sun went\r\ndown on that eventful day, the Russian fleet was in hopeless disorder,\r\nand its stoutest ships were almost unmanageable wrecks. The experience\r\nof the _Czarevitch_ and the _Retvisan_, as recounted by survivors on\r\nboard of those devoted vessels, affords a lurid picture of the\r\nappalling nature of a modern naval battle. The _Czarevitch_, which\r\nultimately reached Kiao-chau, was bombarded at close range by several\r\nof the Japanese armorclads. In the course of five minutes she was\r\nstruck by three successive 12in. shells, and that fact--which is an\r\neloquent testimony to the quality of the Japanese gunnery--practically\r\ndecided her fate. Admiral Witoft was killed by the first shell, and his\r\nchief of staff was mortally wounded by the second. The steering gear\r\nwas knocked to bits, so that the ship was out of control and began to\r\ntravel in a circle, and the foremast was tumbled over the side; while\r\nevery man in one of the batteries was blown to pieces. The guns' crews\r\nwere annihilated at the work, and the deck gear was twisted into\r\nfantastic shapes or carried away altogether; and so much of it was\r\nafterwards picked up that the Japanese supposed that the _Czarevitch_\r\nhad foundered. Poor Witoft--as brave a man as ever sailed--met a\r\nterrible death. He was blown to pieces by a shell, and of his body only\r\none leg was ever found. His last signal was: \"Remember the Emperor's\r\norder not to return to Port Arthur.\" The decks of the battleship\r\npresented the appearance of a shambles; her armor-plating was pierced\r\nin four places; her masts were shattered and bent in the form of a\r\ncross; her bridge was carried away; and many of her guns were disabled.\r\nSteering with her propellers she managed, under the cover of night, to\r\nescape the attacks of the Japanese torpedo-boats, and to reach\r\nKiao-chau. Hardly less severe was the mauling which the _Retvisan_\r\nreceived. This battleship received such a concentrated fire that when\r\nshe attempted to break from the circle of her enemies, she was\r\nliterally blown out of her course. The other four Russian battleships\r\nsuffered more or less severely. The _Pobieda_, for instance, had her\r\nmasts carried away, and her heavy guns were put out of action. When the\r\n_Czarevitch_ got out of control, the Russian line was necessarily\r\nbroken, and then the fleet seems to have suffered most severely. The\r\ncommand of the squadron passed to Prince Ukhtomsky, as second in rank\r\nto Admiral Witoft, and that of the cruiser division to Rear-Admiral\r\nReitzenstein; and between the two there seem to have been divided\r\ncounsels. The latter decided to cut his way southwards at any cost in\r\naccordance with the orders of the Czar. With the _Askold_, _Novik_,\r\n_Pallada_, and _Diana_, he became engaged with the Japanese cruisers,\r\nand by dint of hard fighting, in which the _Askold_ was badly mauled,\r\nhe managed to get clear of the enemy, and in the early morning of the\r\n13th reached Shanghai, having lost sight of the other cruisers. The\r\n_Askold_ had lost two of her five funnels, one of the boilers was\r\ninjured, and her hull had been pierced in more than half a dozen\r\nplaces, both above and below the water-line. Prince Ukhtomsky preferred\r\nanother course. When the signal had been displayed from the\r\n_Czarevitch_ \"Admiral transfers command,\" the Prince, who was next in\r\nseniority, signalled from his ship, the _Peresviet_, \"Follow me\"--an\r\norder which, as we have seen, the cruiser division did not obey. But\r\nthe battleships answered the signal; and the course steered was back to\r\nPort Arthur. In his dispatch the Prince said: \"As my vessel had lost\r\nmany killed and wounded, and her armament, hull and electric apparatus\r\nwere seriously damaged, I decided to return to Port Arthur.\" Through\r\nthe dark night the six battleships steamed slowly to their haven,\r\nrepeated torpedo attacks compelling them again and again to change\r\ncourse, and finally to disperse. The _Czarevitch_, as we have seen,\r\nreached Kiao-chau almost in a sinking condition, while in the morning\r\nof the 11th, the _Peresviet_, the _Retvisan_, the _Sevastopol_, the\r\n_Pobieda_, the _Poltava_, and the cruiser _Pallada_ arrived again at\r\nthe port which they had left twenty-four hours earlier. A list of\r\nnearly 400 killed and wounded was the witness to the severity of the\r\npunishment which these vessels had received. But it was evident that\r\nthey were not so damaged as to have been incapable of continuing the\r\nattempt to break through to the south. Their return to Port Arthur\r\nrendered all that they had suffered vain. It meant that their situation\r\nwas as precarious as ever, while their condition was less favorable for\r\nenduring it. The displeasure of the Czar was not long in manifesting\r\nitself. Hardly had the consternation of defeat subsided, than an\r\nImperial order was issued removing the unhappy Prince Ukhtomsky from\r\nhis command. Recalled he could not be, because the means of leaving\r\nPort Arthur were denied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIANS RECAPTURING THEIR LOST GUNS AT LIAO-YANG.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Harbors of Refuge]\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the full measure of Russia's disaster could be\r\nascertained; for the movements of several of the dispersed vessels had\r\nbeen lost sight of. But at last all doubts were resolved. The\r\n_Czarevitch_ and three destroyers reached Kiao-chau. The _Askold_ and\r\none destroyer found refuge at Shanghai. The _Diana_ was able to make\r\nthe French port of Saigon. Two destroyers went ashore near Wei-hai-wei\r\nand were abandoned; and one destroyer entered Chifu Harbor and was\r\nthere seized by the Japanese and made a prize, in defiance of respect\r\nfor a neutral port. The indomitable little _Novik_ alone of all\r\nRussia's fleet attempted to make for Vladivostock. This swift cruiser\r\nhad come out of the fight comparatively uninjured; and having put into\r\nKiao-chau for coal, she steamed eastward again, and for some days was\r\nlost sight of. But the Japanese, though full of admiration for the\r\nexploits of the _Novik_, could not afford to let her escape, and they\r\nwere on the watch for her appearance in the straits through which she\r\nmust pass to reach Vladivostock. The cruisers _Tsushima_ and _Chitose_\r\nhad been searching the Soya Straits, which lie between Saghalien and\r\nYezo, when at last the former vessel sighted the little _Novik_ on the\r\nafternoon of the 20th of August in Korsakovsk Harbor. Immediately the\r\nattack began, and the _Novik_ was soon compelled to retreat into the\r\ninner harbor, but not before she had inflicted such damage on the\r\n_Tsushima_ as to compel her to draw off. Presently, however, the\r\n_Chitose_ arrived, and next day completed the destruction of the\r\n_Novik_, whose crew abandoned her after running her on the beach. So\r\nended the career of the one ship in the Russian Navy whose handling has\r\nconsistently done credit to Russian seamanship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International Complications]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of fugitive vessels of the Russian squadron in neutral\r\nports at once raised international questions of no little anxiety and\r\ndifficulty. The attitude of Germany in particular was jealously watched\r\nby the Japanese; but, fortunately, in this case the behavior of the\r\nneutral Power was perfectly correct. The _Czarevitch_ and the three\r\ndestroyers in Kiao-chau were at once ordered to be dismantled, and\r\ntheir crews sent home on _parole_. Equally prompt and unimpeachable was\r\nthe action of the French Government in regard to the cruiser _Diana_;\r\nbut the case of the _Askold_ at Shanghai threatened to give much more\r\ntrouble. It was aggravated, too, by the indefensible action of the\r\nJapanese in the case of the destroyer _Rishitelni_, which reached Chifu\r\non the 11th, bearing important dispatches. The Japanese followed the\r\n_Rishitelni_, and believing that the Chinese would not be able to\r\nenforce the disarmament of the boat, and their demands for her\r\nimmediate departure having been ignored, a Japanese officer and armed\r\nguard boarded her. A scuffle between the Japanese and the Russian crews\r\nfollowed; and in the result, in spite of the protests of the Chinese,\r\nthe _Rishitelni_ was towed out of the harbor, after an ineffectual\r\nattempt on the part of her crew had been made to blow her up. The act\r\nwas certainly a violation of Chinese neutrality; but as the\r\n_Rishitelni_ had remained in the harbor for twenty-seven hours without\r\nany sign of disarming, the Japanese had good reason to believe that the\r\nRussian commander was not particularly sensitive to the claims of\r\nChina's neutrality; and how well this belief was founded appeared in\r\nthe case of the _Askold_, which found refuge at Shanghai. In insolent\r\ndefiance of all right and law, the commander of the _Askold_ refused\r\neither to disarm his vessel or to leave the neutral port. The wretched\r\nChinese authorities, squeezed on one side by the Russian Government and\r\non the other by the Japanese, could do nothing. One day they issued\r\nperemptory orders for the Russian vessel to leave; and the next day\r\nthey extended the period of grace. A grave international situation\r\nthreatened; for the Japanese were impatient at the necessity of having\r\nto detain several of the much-needed cruisers in watching the port, and\r\nthey threatened extreme measures; for all this time the _Askold_ was\r\nbeing repaired and put into fighting trim again. But at last the\r\nBritish Minister interfered to stop the work of repairs; and then the\r\nCzar issued instructions that the _Askold_ and the destroyer that\r\naccompanied her should be dismantled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insignificant Japanese Losses]\r\n\r\nIn winning this signal victory over the fleet of his enemy, Admiral\r\nTogo suffered but slight damage to the ships under his command. In\r\nspite of the heavy fighting at close range, none of the Japanese\r\nvessels were crippled--a circumstance of the utmost importance to\r\nJapan, who, unlike her enemy, has no second fleet to draw upon, and\r\nwhose losses were therefore irreparable. The _Mikasa_, in which the\r\nbrunt of the fighting fell, lost 32 killed and 78 wounded; the\r\n_Yakumo_, 12 killed and 10 wounded; the _Nishin_, 16 killed and 17\r\nwounded; the _Kasuga_, 10 wounded; and the rest of the fleet a few\r\nwounded only. These casualties altogether were far exceeded by those\r\nendured on the _Czarevitch_ or the _Retvisan_ alone; and the difference\r\ncan only be accounted for by the greater accuracy and efficiency of the\r\nJapanese gun fire. Of the fleet that left Port Arthur on the morning of\r\nthe 10th of August, only a shattered remnant returned again--five\r\nbattleships and two cruisers. But the sum of Russia's disasters had not\r\nbeen reached. It was fated that the Vladivostock squadron was to share\r\nthe fate of the Port Arthur fleet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Last Raid from Vladivostock]\r\n\r\nSo sudden had been Admiral Witoft's resolution to attempt a sortie,\r\nthat no arrangements for concerted action with Admiral Skrydloff at\r\nVladivostock had been made. It was the destroyer _Rishitelni_, whose\r\narrival at Chifu caused such unpleasantness, that bore the message\r\ninforming Skrydloff of what was happening. Fortunately for themselves\r\nthe Japanese seized the _Rishitelni_ too late to intercept that\r\nmessage. Skrydloff on the 12th steamed from Vladivostock with the\r\ncruisers _Gromoboi_, _Rossia_, and _Rurik_, and made straight for the\r\nKorean Straits. In the early morning of the 14th of August the Russian\r\ncruisers reached their old hunting-ground, and the critical point in\r\ntheir course--the narrow channel that separates the southernmost\r\nJapanese islands from the Korean promontory. In their successful raid\r\nduring July the Vladivostock cruisers had reached the same point, and\r\nby good luck had evaded Kamimura's pursuit. The fortune of war had\r\nhitherto been all against the gallant Japanese Admiral, to whom had\r\nbeen committed the task of watching the Vladivostock squadron, and in\r\nparticular, of guarding the Korean Straits. Even on this last decisive\r\noccasion that was to avenge his previous disappointments, he nearly\r\nmissed his prey, who had got to southward of his fleet. But a timely\r\nglint of sunlight revealed the object of his long quest, and\r\nimmediately putting his ships between the enemy and Vladivostock he was\r\nable to say with Cromwell at Dunbar: \"The Lord hath delivered them into\r\nmy hand\". Kamimura had with him four armored cruisers of high speed and\r\npowerful armament--the _Tokiwa_, the _Adzuma_, the _Idzumo_, and the\r\n_Iwate_. The last two vessels were of 24 knots speed, and the slowest\r\nwas of 21 knots. In gun power all the vessels were practically equal,\r\nand were much more heavily armed than the Russian cruisers, to which\r\nthey now found themselves opposed. Of these the _Gromoboi_, a huge\r\nvessel of 12,336 tons displacement, was the latest and the most\r\nformidable. The _Rossia_ was her equal in every respect except gun\r\nprotection; but the _Rurik_ was of another class altogether in a\r\ndirection that proved fatal to her--namely, speed. Her engines were\r\nonly capable of developing 18 knots, and that made her a terrible\r\nhindrance to the manoeuvring power of the whole squadron. It was not\r\nuntil the Japanese had crossed the course of the Russians that the\r\nlatter became aware of the presence of the enemy, and then they\r\nimmediately put about and steered north. According to the report of the\r\nRussian Admiral, the fight began at half-past four in the morning a\r\nlittle north of the line between Fusan and Tsushima. The Russians\r\nattempted to make for the open sea northwards, but were headed off,\r\nmainly owing to the inferior steaming power of the _Rurik_, which was\r\nin the rear of the line. The Russians were in single column line ahead,\r\nwhile the Japanese steering across their course adopted the famous\r\nT-shaped formation which is associated with the name of Admiral Togo.\r\nThe battle began at a range of five miles, and very soon the superior\r\ngunnery and heavier armament of the Japanese told its tale. The\r\nRussians changed course to the east, and immediately the ill-fated\r\n_Rurik_ began to drop behind, enabling the Japanese cruisers to\r\nconcentrate the fire on her at a range of little more than three miles.\r\nThe steering gear broke down, and the vessel speedily became\r\nunmanageable, while the havoc wrought by the rain of shells poured into\r\nher quickly rendered her guns unworkable. With splendid gallantry the\r\n_Rurik's_ consorts, seeing her desperate plight, returned to her\r\nassistance, and circled round her in order to draw the enemy's fire and\r\nto give the crippled cruiser a chance of effecting repairs. They\r\nsuffered heavily in the attempt, and their sacrifice was unavailing.\r\nThe _Rurik_ burst into flames, which her devoted crew could not subdue.\r\nHer movements became erratic. She developed a heavy list to port, and\r\nthen began to settle down by the stern. At last, after the fight had\r\nbeen going on for nearly four hours, it became evident that the _Rurik_\r\nwas doomed; and her consorts, who were in sorry case themselves, left\r\nher to make their own escape. Both the _Gromoboi_ and the _Rossia_ had\r\nbeen struck repeatedly below the water line, and had been fired in\r\nseveral places by the Japanese shells, though the fires were got under.\r\nWhat finally decided their flight was the arrival of reinforcements for\r\nthe enemy in the shape of the _Noniwa_ and the _Takachiho_--two\r\nprotected cruisers of the second class. These vessels were left to\r\nfinish off the already sinking _Rurik_, while Admiral Kamimura set off\r\nat full speed in pursuit of the _Gromoboi_ and _Rossia_. For some\r\nreason, however, which has never yet appeared, this pursuit was not\r\npersisted in. Both the Russian cruisers were badly damaged, and there\r\nis no reason to suppose that they could have ever reached Vladivostock,\r\nas they did a day or two later, if Admiral Kamimura had not drawn off\r\nhis ships. There is, of course, no doubt that there must have been some\r\ncompelling reason to induce the Japanese Admiral to forego the full\r\nfruits of his opportunity, but that he should have had to do so made\r\nhis victory much less complete and decisive. He returned to the scene\r\nof battle to discover that the _Rurik_ had gone down, but in time to\r\nassist in saving the crew, of whom some 600 survivors were rescued.\r\nThis act of humanity was not a solitary instance, but it is one of the\r\nmost striking instances of the magnanimous temper in which the Mikado's\r\nforces both on land and sea carried on the war. The Russian Commander,\r\nin his official report, makes it clear that he was much surprised and\r\nrelieved when he found that the pursuit of his cruisers was being\r\nabandoned. He states that at this stage of the battle three of the\r\nfunnels on the _Rossia_ were holed, and three of her boilers were\r\nrendered useless, so that she was not able to keep up full steam, while\r\neleven holes had been made in the vessel's hull below the water-line.\r\nThe _Gromoboi_ had six holes below her water-line; while on both of the\r\ncruisers the loss of life had been most severe. More than half the\r\ntotal number of officers had been killed or wounded, and quite a\r\nquarter of the crews. Thirty miles away from the spot where the _Rurik_\r\nhad been left sinking, the _Gromoboi_ and _Rossia_ were able, by the\r\nmysterious drawing off of the enemy, to stop their engines and effect\r\ntemporary repairs. On the 16th of August they arrived again at\r\nVladivostock, and went immediately into dock--with the certainty of\r\ntaking no further part in active operations for some months to come.\r\nThus within a single week both squadrons of Russia's navy in the Far\r\nEast suffered signal and overwhelming disaster with the effect of\r\nimmediately and palpably relieving the difficulties of the campaign for\r\nthe invasion of Manchuria. If the dispersal and repulse of the Port\r\nArthur fleet was the more momentous event of the two, the shattering of\r\nthe Vladivostock squadron had an immense value in at once restoring\r\nconfidence and immunity to Japan's seaborne trade, and in removing from\r\nTogo's flank, as it were, a menace which since the opening of the war\r\nhe had never been able wholly to dismiss. As one result of these naval\r\nvictories, the war-worn and storm-beaten ships of the Japanese fleet\r\nblockading Port Arthur were able in turn to go into dock for the\r\nexecution of those repairs which must have become increasingly\r\nnecessary; while at the same time it was possible to strengthen and\r\ntighten the blockade, and push on with perfect freedom from risk with\r\nthe preparations for landing men and munitions at the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE DECK OF THE \"RURIK.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Port Arthur Garrison]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Port Arthur, which the Japanese, in the pardonable\r\nconfidence begotten of their uninterrupted victories on sea and land,\r\nhad believed to be imminent long ago, now became the object of renewed\r\nand desperate endeavor. Dalny Harbor had been cleared of mines, and\r\nrendered available for the landing of siege trains; and no sooner had\r\nthe ill-fated sortie of the fleet been frustrated, than the Japanese\r\nsettled down again to a fierce assault. As a preliminary, on the 16th\r\nof August a message was sent to General Stoessel under a flag of truce\r\ndemanding the surrender of the fortress, and proposing that, in case of\r\nnon-compliance, the non-combatants should be allowed to leave. To the\r\nformer of these proposals, General Stoessel, as might have been\r\nexpected of so brave and resolute a soldier, returned an emphatic and\r\nindignant negative; and the second, with much less reason, he equally\r\nrefused to entertain. Just at this moment all good Russians had been\r\ngladdened, even in the midst of their disasters, by the long-hoped-for\r\nbirth of an heir to the Imperial Throne, and General Stoessel was able\r\nto send a congratulatory message to the Czar, while receiving in his\r\nturn an order appointing him, as a mark of special Imperial favor, an\r\naide-de-camp general. The determination of the Russian garrison had\r\nnever abated for a moment; and such assurances that the eyes and hopes\r\nof all Russia were centred on them, stirred them to the heroic pitch of\r\nendurance. Shut off from the outer world both by sea and land, with\r\nprovisions and ammunition daily becoming more scanty, and beneath the\r\nharassment of an incessant bombardment and fierce and desperate\r\nassaults, they held grimly on to the defences, and defied the worst\r\nthat the enemy could do, in spite of his overwhelming numbers. The\r\nprogress of the siege could not be followed easily by the external\r\nspectator, because the Japanese strictly kept their own counsel; while\r\nthe reports that were brought to Chifu from time to time by Chinese\r\nrefugees were conflicting and contradictory in the last degree. One\r\nthing only was undeniably evident--that the Japanese assaults on\r\ndifferent sections of the main line of defence had been made with\r\ndesperate valor and indifference to loss of life; and that, except in\r\nunimportant instances, these assaults had not prevailed. Forts were\r\nindeed captured, but had to be abandoned again, because they were\r\nexposed to the fire of neighboring forts. Not in vain had the Russian\r\nengineers exercised their best brains in devising the defences of this\r\n\"impregnable fortress\". Mines, wire entanglements, and every other grim\r\nexpedient for checking assault had been constructed with patient\r\ningenuity; and, most deadly and cunning device of all, every fort in\r\nthe long chain that shuts in Port Arthur on the land side had been so\r\nplaced as to be dominated by the neighboring forts; so that no enemy\r\nwho succeeded in capturing it could hope to plant his own guns there.\r\nIt is not in question that the Japanese suffered appalling losses in\r\nthe attempts to storm these defences; but they persevered, though for\r\nweeks together their hostile activities were limited to pouring into\r\nthe Russian lines a tremendous shell fire at long range. The fall of\r\nPort Arthur which had seemed possible in June, was confidently\r\npredicted for July. Then August was fixed, and the Japanese forces,\r\nlargely reinforced, undertook another desperate assault in the middle\r\nof that month. It failed; and though the dogged, impenetrable defence\r\nand the fierce and reckless struggle went on with few intermissions,\r\nOctober came without any perceptible change having been effected in the\r\nsituation of the combatants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fury Unparalleled in History]\r\n\r\nTwo Russian officers who escaped with dispatches to Chifu, brought\r\naccounts of the terrible pitch to which the temper of the opposing\r\nforces had been wrought in their long-drawn and implacable struggle.\r\nThey stated that the Japanese losses during the last attack were\r\nenormous, and that even several days afterwards wounded men were to be\r\nseen raising their arms by way of appeal, but that it was impossible to\r\nhelp them as the fire was incessant. As for the struggle, it was\r\ncarried on with an amount of fury to which there is no parallel in\r\nhistory. The Japanese dashed forward with the bayonet like madmen, and\r\nin serried columns, in which the shells made terrible furrows. Every\r\ntime that they reached the Russian lines horrible mêlées, in which even\r\nthe wounded fought to the death, took place. No quarter was given.\r\nPairs of corpses were found clinging to each other, the teeth of the\r\nmen being buried in their adversaries' throats and their fingers in\r\ntheir eyes as they had expired. In the last attack the 9th Japanese\r\nDivision was sent forward in two columns, each composing a brigade, and\r\nwhen the first gave way under the avalanche of iron, the general\r\ncommanding the second fired upon and exterminated it. So intense was\r\nthe fury that when they got within hearing of their foes, the Japanese\r\nshook their fists at and insulted them. The failure of the Japanese to\r\nmake headway with the siege of Port Arthur was the one substantially\r\ngratifying aspect of the war from the Russian point of view. Russian\r\npatriotic sentiment had something to be proud of in the courage,\r\nendurance, and resource of General Stoessel and his troops. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the fall of Port Arthur would have been a far better\r\nservice to Russian arms than the heroic resistance of its garrison.\r\nBecause the fortress, which from the first had exercised such a\r\nbenumbing influence on the Russian fleet and such a distracting\r\ninfluence on military counsels, still remained as a fatal factor in the\r\nequation for Russian strategy. The garrison were counting on relief\r\nfrom the north, and the honor and pride of Russia were engaged to send\r\nthat relief if possible. Consequently, Kuropatkin never had his hand\r\nfree. He could never review the situation with a single eye to its\r\nsupreme strategical necessities; he must always qualify his\r\ndispositions and plans by regard for the plight of Port Arthur. It was\r\nthis vitiating influence that brought about the initial reverses of the\r\nRussian armies; and that prevented any bold and effective plan for\r\nmeeting the Japanese advance. Finally, it was this consideration that\r\ninduced Kuropatkin to give battle at Liao-yang, and to expose his\r\nentire army to a disaster from which he only escaped by the skin of his\r\nteeth. Allusion to that tremendous conflict, between forces larger than\r\nany that have ever before been opposed in modern war, has already been\r\nmade in the last chapter. But the event was so memorable, and has such\r\nbearing on the future course of the campaign, that it is permissible to\r\nreturn to the subject, especially as further light has been thrown on\r\nit by the detailed narratives of correspondents. Of this great battle,\r\nby the way, the world has received fuller descriptions than of any\r\nother feature of the campaign by land or sea; for it so happened that\r\nthe sufferance of the war correspondents under the restriction of the\r\nJapanese military authorities broke down here, and several of the most\r\ndistinguished representatives of the English press threw up their\r\nconnection with the Japanese army after Liao-yang, and hurried back to\r\nneutral territory to cable home the full dispatches which the censor\r\nwould not have permitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuroki Improves his Reputation]\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly evident in the light of these accounts that the\r\nJapanese, emboldened by their previous successes, rated their enemy too\r\nlightly, and without any preponderance, and indeed with scarcely an\r\nequality of numbers, they attempted to take by assault a position\r\nnaturally strong and fortified by all the art and resources of the\r\nmilitary engineer. The battle did indeed prove the incomparable\r\nqualities of the Japanese soldier; but it did little to add to the\r\nreputation of Japanese generalship; while, on the other hand, it\r\nexhibited General Kuropatkin in a light infinitely more favorable than\r\nany in which he had previously appeared. If one of Kuropatkin's\r\nsubordinates--General Orloff--had not blundered badly in carrying out\r\nthe movements against Kuroki on the Russian left, it is probable that\r\nthe battle might have resulted in a decisive defeat instead of in a\r\nnominal victory for the Japanese. That blunder--which cost Orloff his\r\ncommand--enabled Kuroki to hold his own at a most critical juncture,\r\nand so to obviate the dangerous possibilities which the situation had\r\ndeveloped. It was the peril of Kuroki that compelled Oku and Nodzu, who\r\nfaced the centre and right wing of the Russian position, to press on\r\ntheir assaults with redoubled fury, even after they had been fighting\r\nfor five days and losing thousands of men without making appreciable\r\nheadway. In twenty-four hours Oku made three grand assaults upon the\r\nentrenched hills before him; and, when the last had been beaten back\r\nwith awful loss, the laconic order came from headquarters: \"Reinforce\r\nand attack again at dawn\". Such a demand upon the endurance and\r\n_morale_ of troops is well-nigh unexampled; and that the Japanese\r\nsoldier responded to it speaks volumes for his qualities as a fighting\r\nman. His persistence prevailed in the end, and the Russian line was\r\nforced. But even then the retreat was slow and stubborn. While a rear\r\nguard held the Japanese at bay, all the guns and wounded were safely\r\nwithdrawn, and when at last the Japanese came into possession of\r\nLiao-yang, it was to find the fruits of their dearly-bought victory\r\nsnatched from them, and their own forces too exhausted to follow\r\nvictory up. The casualties in this awful conflict were enough \"to\r\nstagger humanity\", if one may use Mr. Kruger's famous phrase. The\r\nJapanese losses cannot have been less than 40,000, and those of the\r\nRussians were perhaps half as many; while the expenditure of ammunition\r\non both sides was terrific. More than a thousand guns belched forth\r\ntheir deadly missiles continuously for nearly a week, and all\r\neye-witnesses agree that never before has such tremendous artillery\r\nfire been witnessed. Well might it be necessary for both armies to rest\r\nafter such a titanic struggle, and to devote more than a month to\r\nreforming and reinforcing the shattered ranks and to refilling their\r\nammunition trains. The main result of the battle was to drive the grand\r\narmy of the Czar one step further back from the beleaguered fortress\r\nstill counting so confidently on and waiting so anxiously for relief.\r\nBut, as the event showed the contest had been too indecisive to destroy\r\nfinally the Russian hope of a victorious march southwards; and to that\r\nextent the Japanese might congratulate themselves. As long as the fatal\r\nfascination of Port Arthur was felt by Russian strategy, the Japanese\r\ngenerals could count on an invaluable ally; and very soon that ally was\r\nto come to their assistance again in a manner which their best hopes\r\ncould not have conjectured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Grim Reality of War]\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the spectacle that that awful battlefield\r\npresented, one has only to read the vivid narrative of the London\r\n_Times'_ correspondent who was attached to General Oku's army. This is\r\nhow he describes the earlier and abortive attempts of Oku's devoted\r\ntroops to penetrate the Russian centre:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER SEVEN MONTHS.\r\n\r\nThe time was now ripe for the simultaneous advance of the three\r\nJapanese armies, and while Oku and Nodzu attacked the Russians at\r\nAnshanchan, and forced them to retire, Kuroki drove the Russians out of\r\nAnping. The great battle of Liaoyang began on August 29, and continued\r\nuntil September 1, when Kuroki, having crossed the Taitse-Ho,\r\nthreatened the Russian left flank, and forced them to retreat. On\r\nSeptember 6 the Japanese occupied the Yentai Mines. The army besieging\r\nPort Arthur captured the Laotishan and Sushiyen Hills on August 15, and\r\non the 28th took Palungshan.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\n\"In spite of the failure of this first attack, another was ordered to\r\nbegin at two on the following morning (August 30th). The cold grey\r\nmorning witnessed another scene of slaughter on the Russian right as\r\nthe defenders again hurled the attack back. The Japanese attacked with\r\nvalor and deserved success, but the enfilading fire on every salient\r\nswept each rush away before the men could even lay hands on the\r\nentanglements. But the 5th Division had more success against the\r\nRussian left. The position here was composed of a brush-covered\r\nhogsback, sloping to the east, defended by a triple line of trenches\r\nwith a glacis protected by a 10 foot entanglement covering a honeycomb\r\nof pits containing spikes at the bottom. In the semi-darkness of the\r\nmorning the 41st Regiment carried this underfeature after losing\r\nseventy-five of the one hundred pioneers who hacked their way through\r\nthe entanglement with axes. The men, rushing through the gap,\r\noverpowered the sentries in the trenches before the supports, sleeping\r\nin splinter proofs behind, could reinforce them. But daybreak brought a\r\ntragedy of the kind which is so common in modern war. Shell fire,\r\nbelieved to be from Japanese guns, drove this gallant storming party\r\nfrom its hold, filling the Russian trenches with Japanese dead. But now\r\nfor the fighting on the 31st. The weather was now fine, and the energy\r\nof this southern attack all the morning was concentrated in an\r\nartillery fire on the bushy hill that had been won and lost. At 10\r\no'clock we could see the 5th Division moving up against the Russian\r\nleft. There is a moment of intense excitement while the summit of the\r\nRussian position is like a miniature Mount Pelée in eruption owing to\r\nthe bursting of dozens of Shimoshi shells. The head of the assault is\r\nin the gap in the entanglement. The artillery is supporting the\r\nassault. Three or four ground mines explode in the midst of the leading\r\nassaulting groups. Then as the smoke clears the black-coated Russians\r\nare seen leaving the position. In a moment the Japanese are in, and the\r\nwhole of the lines in support on the crest are firing down the slope\r\ninto the retreating Russians. But one swallow does not make a summer.\r\nAlthough the underfeature of the bushy hill was carried, the rest of\r\nthe assault failed miserably. No Japanese could live within 500 yards\r\nof the bastion hill, and though the Japanese came out of the corn until\r\nthe groups were so numerous that I can liken them only to swarming\r\nbees, it was only to be swept backwards into cover again, leaving\r\nbehind the heavy price of their valor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTURE OF THE \"RESHITELNI\" AT CHIFU.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  The Opposing Armies in Manchuria--The Russian\r\n    Advance--Reinforcements for Both Sides--Battle of the\r\n    Sha-ho--Two Hundred Hours of Carnage--Awful List of\r\n    Casualties--Threat and Counterthreat--The Veil Lifted from Port\r\n    Arthur--Capture of Forts--Devices of the Besiegers--The\r\n    Undaunted Stoessel--The Gallant Podgorsky--World-Wide\r\n    Admiration--Uncertain News.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Opposing Armies in Manchuria]\r\n\r\nThe great battle of Liao-yang was fought in the last week of August and\r\nthe first week of September; and for nearly five weeks after that\r\ntremendous struggle the opposing armies remained inactive, or rather\r\ngathered up their exhausted strength for the next desperate encounter.\r\nThe Japanese had advanced as far as Yentai, a station about one-third\r\nof the distance--40 miles or so--that separates Liao-yang from Mukden.\r\nThe position was valuable as giving the command of the Yentai coal\r\nmines--a most important acquisition to any general with a long line of\r\nrailway communication to maintain. The Japanese entrenched themselves\r\nalong a front of some 25 miles, stretching from Yentai on the railway\r\nto Pensihu, a village in the hilly country which lies north and south\r\nbetween the two rivers Taitse and Hun. There they settled down to\r\nreplenishing the exhausted supplies, refilling the depleted ranks, and\r\nreorganizing the dislocated commands. Above all did they make speed to\r\nreconstruct the railway behind them, a work which had diligently been\r\ncarried on _pari passu_ with the advance. Early in October through\r\ntrains of the new 3 ft. 6 in. gauge were running from Dalny to Yentai,\r\nand thus the fighting-line was brought within an easy six days' journey\r\nof Japan. The Russians, on the other hand, in spite of the completion\r\nof the Circum-Baikal railway towards the end of September, were still\r\nfrom three to five times as distant from their prime base; for if the\r\nexpress time from Mukden to Moscow was sixteen days, the ordinary troop\r\ntrain's time was much nearer thirty days. In this all-important matter\r\nof rapidity of communication the Japanese possessed an advantage\r\ninherent to the situation and of the profoundest strategical influence.\r\nWhile they were recuperating thus at Yentai, the Russians were busy\r\nentrenching themselves behind the Hun-ho, the course of which from\r\nMukden follows a line, roughly speaking, due east. At first it was\r\nasserted by those in the confidence of the Russian General Staff, that\r\nno determined stand would be made at the Hun-ho, and that Kuropatkin\r\nwould only hold the enemy there until the defences at Tieling were\r\ncompleted. But as the days passed, and the Japanese showed no\r\ndisposition to renew their advance, and as reinforcements continued to\r\npour over the Siberian railway, counsels were modified. In the last\r\nweek of September General Stackelberg, attending a banquet at Mukden,\r\nproposed the toast \"To the March on Liao-yang\"; and this startling\r\nsuggestion of a new development in the Russian plan of campaign was\r\nspeedily confirmed by a remarkable manifesto to his troops which\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin issued on the 2nd of October. After the usual\r\nhigh-flown exordium, in which \"the arrogant foe\" was described as\r\nhaving suffered repeated repulse--a rather daring travesty of the\r\nfacts--Kuropatkin explained that he had not thought the time ripe \"to\r\ntake advantage of these successes; but\", he added, \"the time of retreat\r\nwas now at an end. Hitherto the enemy in operating has relied on his\r\ngreat forces and, disposing his armies so as to surround us, has chosen\r\nas he deemed fit his time for attack; but now the moment to go and meet\r\nthe enemy, for which the whole army has been longing, has come, and the\r\ntime has arrived for us to compel the Japanese to do our will, for the\r\nforces of the Manchurian army are strong enough to begin the forward\r\nmovement. Bear in mind the importance of victory to Russia, and, above\r\nall, remember how necessary victory is the more speedily to relieve our\r\nbrothers at Port Arthur, who for seven months have heroically\r\nmaintained the defence of the fortress entrusted to their care.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Advance]\r\n\r\nThe world was naturally startled by such a pronouncement--so much\r\neasier to explain than to justify; but the Russians and their friends\r\nin France were overjoyed, believing that the time of their tribulation\r\nwas at last over. The Muscovite nature has during this war shown an\r\nunrivalled capacity for self-deception; and not only the General Staff,\r\nbut Kuropatkin himself seem to have persuaded themselves that the enemy\r\nhad been unable to get over the shock of Liao-yang. The perfectly\r\nnatural delay of the Japanese in advancing was attributed to the\r\ndiscouragement caused by the enormous losses sustained in the last\r\nbattle and to inability to make these losses good. There were other\r\ninfluences at work, as Kuropatkin's address shows. \"The importance of\r\nvictory to Russia\", and the necessity of relieving \"our brothers in\r\nPort Arthur\", were circumstances that evidently dominated Russian\r\ncounsels; and in Kuropatkin's mind there was probably another\r\nconsideration of a personal nature. After Liao-yang the Czar had\r\nordered the formation of a Second Manchurian Army under a separate\r\ncommand, on the ground that the active direction in the field of such\r\nenormous forces as these two armies would represent would be beyond the\r\ncapacity of any one man. General Gripenberg, a tried old soldier, was\r\nappointed to command the Second Army, and there was talk of sending out\r\na Grand Duke to take the supreme direction of the campaign. This would\r\nhave meant in degree the suppression of General Kuropatkin, and that\r\ncapable soldier may well have looked with dissatisfaction on such a\r\nreward for his signal services. He may have argued with himself that if\r\nhe could only achieve a decisive victory at this moment his prestige\r\nwould be restored and his paramountcy assured; and, according to the\r\ninformation which had reached him, that victory was within his grasp.\r\nBut, unfortunately, that information was wholly erroneous. Far from\r\nbeing dispirited and exhausted, the Japanese forces were on the very\r\npoint of advancing to the attack again when Kuropatkin formed his\r\nmomentous resolution and issued orders for \"the march to Liao-yang\". If\r\nhis movement was hailed with almost delirious enthusiasm in St.\r\nPetersburg, it was observed with hardly less satisfaction at Tokio,\r\nwhere it was at once recognized that the enemy were obligingly\r\nreleasing Marshal Oyama from the necessity of a long march and another\r\nattack on fortified positions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reinforcements for Both Sides]\r\n\r\nBy this time Kuropatkin's forces--thanks to the completion of the\r\nCircum-Baikal railway--had reached 250,000, with more than 800 guns.\r\nThe Japanese strength, after reinforcements both from Japan and from\r\nthe army investing Port Arthur, cannot have been much less; though at\r\nthe close of the battle which was about to be fought Marshal Oyama\r\nasserted that at all points his victorious troops had been outnumbered.\r\nHowever that may be, the Japanese had the advantage of a prepared\r\nposition, the key of which was in rugged mountainous country. Unlike\r\nthe battle of Liao-yang, of which minute details have already been\r\nfurnished, the battle of Yentai, as it was first called, or of Sha-ho,\r\nas it came to be known afterwards, can only be followed in its broad\r\noutline, mainly because the maps available are utterly inadequate. The\r\nplace-names which mark the direction of the operations in one official\r\nreport rarely agree with those in the other official report, and can\r\nonly be vaguely identified. But a rough sketch-map is at least\r\nsufficient to give the general bearings of the operations. The Japanese\r\nfront extended in a horseshoe formation from Yentai, on the railway, to\r\nPensihu, on the Taitse River, with Oku on the left, Nodzu in the\r\ncentre, and Kuroki on the right. The plan of Kuropatkin--a plan which\r\nin the light of after events we know to have been beyond the\r\npossibility of achievement--was to attack the right wing of the\r\nJapanese army under Kuroki, and roll it back upon Liao-yang, while the\r\nJapanese left and centre were held in front; then to shut up Oyama and\r\nhis troops in Liao-yang, much as Sir George White was shut up in\r\nLadysmith, while a rapid march southwards was made to the relief of\r\nPort Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Sha-ho]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th October the Russian advance began on both sides of the\r\nrailway from Mukden, and from Fushan against the Japanese right. The\r\nflank movement, on the success of which all Kuropatkin's schemes were\r\nbased, was entrusted to Stackelberg and Rennenkampf--Stackelberg\r\nattacking from the north, and Rennenkampf with his Cossacks, working\r\nround from the northeast. On Sunday, the 9th October, the first contact\r\nbetween the opposing armies was made, and Stackelberg--much to his own\r\nsurprise--was able to occupy Bentsiaputse, a place north of the Yentai\r\ncoalmines, commanding the main roads to Fushan, Mukden, and Liao-yang.\r\nIt had been expected that the Japanese would make a desperate stand\r\nhere, but they retreated after offering only a feeble resistance.\r\nMeanwhile, Rennenkampf fiercely assailed Kuroki's extreme right at\r\nPensihu, while a force of Cossacks some 3,000 strong daringly crossed\r\nthe Taitse River and severed Kuroki's communications in the rear. Up to\r\nthis moment everything had seemed to go well with the Russian plan of\r\nattack. Several important positions east of Pensihu were taken by\r\nassault, and Kuroki's situation seemed critical for the moment. But\r\nMarshal Oyama appears never to have doubted the ability of his\r\nwell-tried lieutenant to hold his own, and no sooner had the whole\r\nscheme of his enemy been developed than he decided to counter it with a\r\nvigorous offensive. Kuroki was reinforced on the 10th, while a force of\r\ncavalry detached to operate against the Cossacks south of the Taitse-ho\r\nsucceeded in driving the enemy off and in restoring the interrupted\r\ncommunications. As soon as the reinforcements reached Kuroki at Pensihu\r\nhe put the possibility of his being \"rolled up\" beyond all doubt by\r\nfiercely assailing Stackelberg and recapturing the positions which had\r\ntemporarily fallen into Russian hands. Thereafter he remained\r\ncompletely master of the situation, and the desperate but futile\r\nassaults which he sustained in the next few days only resulted in a\r\ntremendous casualty list for the enemy--a list totalling at least\r\n20,000. The decisive repulse of the Russian flanking movement involved\r\nthe frustration of the whole of Kuropatkin's plans in advancing from\r\nthe Hun-ho. But the battle had only just begun yet, for the Russian\r\nright and centre, which had begun their southward march with such\r\nconfidence, now found their _role_ changed from attack to defence; and\r\ninstead of the Japanese being, according to program, forced back upon\r\nLiao-yang, it became a question whether the Russians would be able to\r\nmake good their retreat on Mukden. General Oku, advancing along the\r\nrailway to the west, after two days' hard fighting drove back\r\nKuropatkin's right to the line of the Shi-li-ho; while General Nodzu on\r\nthe east of the railway was equally successful, and signalized his\r\nvictory by a considerable capture of guns. Oyama's object now was to\r\ndrive his enemy eastwards from the railway and back upon the Hun-ho,\r\nwhen it would be impossible for him to escape disaster. For some days\r\nthis tremendous issue hung in the balance, and the Japanese forces were\r\nwithin an ace of accomplishing their purpose. But thanks to the dogged\r\ntenacity of the Russian troops, and thanks still more to the terribly\r\nwasting and exhausting effect of a week's continuous fighting, the\r\nimpetus of the Japanese attack was not quite sufficient to complete the\r\npromised triumph; and at last the two great armies came to a standstill\r\nsome ten miles south of Mukden, incapable of further action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two Hundred Hours of Carnage]\r\n\r\nFrom the 9th October to the 17th the relentless struggle raged along\r\nthis wide front of more than 20 miles. Day and night the devoted troops\r\non either side flung themselves with reckless bravery on the positions\r\nof their foes; while from nearly 2,000 guns an incessant storm of\r\nshrapnel and shell burst over the contested ground. Liao-yang had been\r\nterrible enough; but from all accounts the artillery duel at the battle\r\nof Sha-ho even eclipsed the terrific incidents of the earlier\r\nengagements. On the 13th the Russian retreat became general, and Oku,\r\ncapturing twenty-five Russian guns, succeeded in driving the troops\r\nopposed to him back from the line of the Shi-li-ho to the Sha-ho, where\r\nbehind defences which the forethought of Kuropatkin had provided, they\r\nprepared to make their last desperate stand. The forces before Kuroki\r\nhad retreated towards Fushan in a northeasterly direction; and those\r\nbefore Nodzu in the centre, after suffering losses almost as heavy as\r\nStackelberg's columns had sustained, fell back in something approaching\r\nto disorder on the line of the Sha-ho. The position of Kuropatkin's\r\narmy was now exceedingly critical, and it was not without cause that he\r\nissued a general order that the ground occupied must be held at all\r\ncosts. It is evident that to make good the retreat Stackelberg's troops\r\non the extreme east, which were far in advance of the rest of the\r\nRussian line, must be withdrawn first, and that the central army under\r\nZarubaieff, which again was far in advance of the right wing, must be\r\ndrawn back next; and that during these perilous operations General\r\nBilderling, who commanded the Russian right resting behind the Sha-ho,\r\nmust stand firm. By the skin of his teeth, almost, Bilderling just\r\nmanaged to hold his ground. On the 13th Oku's impetuous assault upon\r\nthe Russian lines succeeded so far as to break the Russian centre. Had\r\nthat advantage been maintained nothing could have saved the Russian\r\narmy. But by a tremendous effort the last reserves were brought up and\r\nrecaptured the ground that had been lost. For thirty-six hours the\r\nbattle raged with varying fortune at this critical point; but the\r\nRussians held on, and these thirty-six priceless hours being gained,\r\nthe Russian centre and left were saved. On the 14th, five days after\r\nthe battle had begun, a deluge of rain fell--a deluge precipitated, as\r\nat Liao-yang, by the heavy and incessant firing--and the already\r\nsorely-tried troops of Oku found their further movements grievously\r\nimpeded. For several days more, however, the contest on the Sha-ho\r\nraged with unabated fury. Again and again the Russians made fierce\r\ncounter-attacks on the Japanese, sustaining terrible losses in\r\nconsequence. One position--a dominant elevation on the south bank of\r\nthe Sha-ho, known as Lonely-Tree Hill--was the scene of long-continued\r\nand desperate fighting, in which both armies alternately captured and\r\nwere driven from the vantage ground. It was here that the one\r\nsubstantial success of the Russian arms was achieved in the capture of\r\ntwelve Japanese guns. During Sunday, the 16th of October the Russians\r\nhad delivered no less than seven counter-attacks on Oku's troops, and\r\nall of them had been beaten back with loss. In these engagements a\r\nconspicuous part had been played by a force under Brigadier-General\r\nYamada, made up of troops from Nodzu's and Oku's commands, which\r\nsucceeded in penetrating the Russian line and in capturing two guns.\r\nBut in returning to camp after this exploit, Yamada's force had\r\nventured too far and was enveloped by a Russian division, and was only\r\nable to win through by the sacrifice of its guns, after a fierce\r\nhand-to-hand encounter in which the casualties were nearly 1,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE OUTPOSTS RELIEVING GUARD NEAR THE SHA-HO.]\r\n\r\nSlowly, reluctantly, after fitful recrudescences, the great battle wore\r\nitself out, and by the 20th October the two armies were left facing\r\neach other on either side of the Sha-ho--a line 15 miles north of that\r\nwhich the Japanese had occupied before the engagement began. The net\r\nresult, therefore, was a decided gain of ground for the Japanese, and\r\nthe infliction of losses greater than had been sustained in any\r\nprevious battle on the Russian army. Telegraphing to Tokio on the 15th,\r\nMarshal Oyama thus summed up the results of the fighting as far as it\r\nhad gone--a summary which further events did not alter:--\r\n\r\n\"As a sequel to a fight lasting continuously for five days, we have\r\ndriven back the superior forces of the enemy at every point, pursuing\r\nhim and forcing him to the south bank of the Hun. We have inflicted\r\nheavy losses, and captured over thirty guns and hundreds of prisoners.\r\nWe have defeated his plans and converted an offensive operation into a\r\nradical failure.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Awful List of Casualties]\r\n\r\n\"Radical failure\" in war means far more than defeated plans. It carries\r\nwith it an awful and immediate penalty levied in killed and wounded,\r\nand when the tale of losses came to be counted it was found to exceed\r\neven the most pessimistic anticipations. The Russian dead left on the\r\nfield alone numbered no less than 13,333; and as the wounded, at the\r\nlowest estimate, cannot have been less than four to one, it is apparent\r\nthat the total casualties suffered by General Kuropatkin's troops must\r\nhave been between 60,000 and 70,000. An index to the severity of the\r\nfighting is afforded by an analysis of these returns, which shows that\r\nmore than 5,000 Russian dead were found before both Oku's army and\r\nKuroki's. Even the Russian General Staff, which has shown a decided\r\ntendency to minimize losses, did not venture to place those sustained\r\nat Sha-ho at less than 45,000 rank and file and 800 officers. The total\r\nJapanese losses, on the other hand, though heavy, were but a fraction\r\nof their foe's. Oyama placing them at 15,879. But the loss in life was\r\nnot the only disastrous result of the battle for the army of the Czar.\r\nThe Japanese captured 709 prisoners and 45 guns, with large quantities\r\nof arms and ammunition; and against these captures are to be set the\r\ntwelve guns lost at Lonely-Tree Hill, rechristened by the Russians\r\nPutiloff Hill in honor of the officer who achieved the success, and who\r\nwas immediately decorated by the Czar. In one sense the battle of the\r\nSha-ho may be regarded as indecisive, in that it left the two\r\ncontending armies again at a deadlock. At Liao-yang the strategy of\r\nboth generals had failed, and in a less degree the same result was\r\nreached at Sha-ho; for Oyama's initial success could not be followed up\r\nto its legitimate and triumphant conclusion. But, on the other hand,\r\nKuropatkin's effort to march to Liao-yang and make a diversion in favor\r\nof Port Arthur had signally failed; and the army which he had\r\nostentatiously declared to be strong enough to take the offensive and\r\nhad been hurled back by \"the arrogant foe,\" who were at last to be\r\n\"compelled to do the Russian will.\" It was in that circumstance that\r\nthe real measure of the Japanese victory was to be found--that after\r\neight months of war the armies of the Czar were still unequal to the\r\ntask committed to them. Had Kuropatkin been even in a measure\r\nsuccessful in this, his first great offensive movement, the moral\r\neffect could not have failed to be incalculable. As it was, it\r\ninflicted one more discouragement on troops that had experienced\r\nnothing but retreats and reverses from the opening of the campaign. The\r\ntemper in which the Japanese accepted the new laurels which their army\r\nhad won was eminently characteristic of a nation which has, in spite of\r\nall temptations to vainglory and exultation, comforted itself with\r\nperfect sobriety and self-restraint. The Mikado issued a rescript to\r\nhis people, the terms of which are worth giving, if only for the\r\ncontrast which they offer to some of the addresses issued from St.\r\nPetersburg and the headquarters of Alexeieff:--\r\n\r\n\"Since the outbreak of the war our army and our navy have demonstrated\r\ntheir bravery and loyalty, while both officials and people have acted\r\nin unison to support the cause. So far, success has attended our cause,\r\nbut, the ultimate accomplishment being yet far distant, it is necessary\r\nto be patient and steadfast in the pursuance of our action, and thus\r\naim at the final accomplishment of our purpose.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Threat and Counterthreat]\r\n\r\nAnother and even more striking testimony to the inflexible\r\ndetermination of the Japanese people was supplied by the Army rescript\r\nissued at the end of September in connection with the expansion of the\r\nJapanese military system. The Government of the Czar had demonstrated\r\nits intention to prosecute the war unflinchingly by the creation of a\r\nsecond Manchurian Army. Japan's answer to this menace was to extend the\r\nperiod of service with the colors in the Japanese army from nine to\r\nfourteen years, by which act the available reserves for the army in\r\nManchuria were increased at a stroke by nearly half a million men. But\r\nthough Japan could answer promptly and adequately the steps which her\r\nfoe had taken to strengthen his armies in the field, it was not so easy\r\nto recompense herself for the elimination of a source of weakness in\r\nher enemy's counsels. Admiral Alexeieff, whose fatal influence had been\r\nas valuable as several battleships and army corps to the Japanese, was\r\nfinally recalled to St. Petersburg at the end of October. On the 26th\r\nof that month the Viceroy issued an address to the troops, announcing,\r\nin his usually inflated style, that on his own request he had been\r\nrelieved of the duties of Commander-in-Chief, while being retained in\r\nthe office of Viceroy and assured of the continuance of the Imperial\r\nconfidence and favor. In less than a week from the issue of that\r\nmanifesto, it was announced that Alexeieff and his staff were on the\r\nway to St. Petersburg by express train, and that there was no\r\nprobability of their return, while Kuropatkin was left in supreme\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Veil Lifted from Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the echoes of the great battle of the Sha-ho died down\r\nthan the attention of the world was turned again to Port Arthur, where\r\nthe long and desperate siege was continuing with undiminished\r\ndetermination on the part of the attack and invincible heroism on the\r\npart of the defence. For months together little authentic news of the\r\nprogress of events had been allowed to leak out; but suddenly, in the\r\nbeginning of November, the Japanese censor removed his restrictions,\r\nand a vivid and circumstantial narrative of the operations was allowed\r\nto come through. By the end of June the Japanese forces of investment\r\nhad occupied a line across the Kwang-tung Peninsula running from\r\nIngentsi Bay, on the north, southeastwards to a point on the south\r\ncoast-line some ten miles east of Dalny. After another month's diligent\r\nassault they had advanced the line nearly five miles--from\r\nVostikorablei Bay on the north to Takhe Bay on the south. Another\r\nadvance in the beginning of August brought the extreme right of their\r\nline down to Louisa Bay on the west, and roughly round in a semicircle\r\nto Takhe Bay, confronting the main line of the formidable Russian\r\ndefences. The great assault of the 28th August was, on the whole,\r\nunsuccessful, and achieved nothing on the east. But on the west the\r\nline of investment was drawn still further south until it rested on\r\nPigeon Bay. It is now necessary to understand more exactly the nature\r\nof the task with which the Japanese army of investment was confronted.\r\nPort Arthur lies in a sort of amphitheatre formed by ranges of hills\r\nvarying in height from 1,300 feet to 1,500 feet. These hills sweep\r\nround from Golden Hill--the promontory which on the east commands the\r\nentrance to the harbor--northwards for a distance of nearly three\r\nmiles. Then, where the railway line and road pass through them, they\r\nturn westwards and southwards, extending down the toe of the Kwang-tung\r\npromontory to a point parallel with the base of the Tiger's Tail; while\r\nfurther south still is the formidable Liao-tie-shan range, some 1,500\r\nfeet high. On all these hills the Russians had constructed huge\r\nfortifications strengthened with every device which the military\r\nengineer's art could suggest, and armed with the most powerful\r\nartillery. It is true that some of the correspondents who paid hurried\r\nvisits to the great naval fortress before the actual outbreak of\r\nhostilities were inclined to belittle the strength of the defences.\r\nThus Mr. Bennet Burleigh, of the London _Telegraph_, in a most\r\ninteresting account expressed his belief that the Russian stronghold\r\nwas over-fortified, and that it would be possible for those who\r\ncaptured outlying defence to command the inner forts. On the other\r\nhand, it must be remembered that the most skilful engineers in the\r\nworld had been employed by the Russians in the construction of the\r\nforts, and the fact that such a magnificent and substantial resistance\r\nwas offered to ten times the number of soldiers as cleared out the\r\nChinese in a few days, proves that the soundest military principles\r\nwere adhered to. The main positions were defended by advanced works\r\nsurrounded by deep moats, in which were built bombproof defences,\r\nroofed with steel plates, and by fanfasses, or mines filled with huge\r\nstones, which could be exploded by the pressure of an electric button.\r\nThe approaches were rendered almost inaccessible by barbed-wire\r\nentanglements, pits planted with sharpened stakes, and by transverse\r\nworks and trenches which commanded with an enfilading fire every\r\npossible line of advance. The broad scheme of the fortifications may be\r\neasily grasped. Fronting Takhe Bay on the east is the Petushan group of\r\nforts, with the Keekwan-Urlong forts commanding the approaches from the\r\nnorth and the northeast, and preventing the Petushan forts from being\r\ntaken in reverse. West of these forts and on the other side of the\r\nparade-ground and railway are the Antszshan and the Etseshan forts,\r\nwhich prevent any attack from the northwest, while a chain of forts\r\nfrom Antszshan to Sunghslwo, running southeastwards down to the inner\r\nharbor, command the parade-ground and railway line. Another line of\r\nforts stretches due south from Etseshan to White Wolf Hill on the west\r\nside of the west port, while yet another series of heavy fortifications\r\nsurmounts the high ground along the Tiger's Tail. Well might the\r\nRussians boast that their fortress was impregnable, for if any place of\r\narms could be justly so described, Nature and military ingenuity had\r\ncombined to earn that title for Port Arthur. At the outset of the\r\ninvestment, Port Arthur's garrison numbered, all told, some 35,000 men.\r\nIt was made up of the 3rd, 4th and 7th East Siberian Rifle Brigades,\r\nwith part of the 6th, and with the East Siberian Rifle Artillery\r\nDivision, and, of course, with the crews of all the men-o'-war lying\r\nimprisoned in the harbor. The numbers were none too great to man\r\nadequately the great chain of works behind which Port Arthur's security\r\nlay; but the troops were of the best quality, and they had the\r\ninvaluable inspiration of such a leader as General Stoessel, with such\r\na capable and gallant lieutenant as General Fock. Stoessel, the hero of\r\nthe Russian army in the present war, is descended from an old military\r\nfamily. His grandfather was a general in the Swedish army, who\r\nafterwards settled in Russia. Stoessel himself, who was born in 1848,\r\nentered the Russian army as a cadet at the age of ten, and received his\r\ncommission eight years later, at the same time, curiously enough, as\r\nKuropatkin. He served with distinction in the Russo-Turkish War, and\r\nafterwards held important commands in Siberia, while since 1899 he had\r\nbeen stationed at Port Arthur. To the assault and investment of the\r\nfortress, the Japanese, under Nogi, brought up at first 60,000 men,\r\nand, as the operations advanced, large reinforcements which not only\r\nmade good the enormous losses sustained, but swelled the fighting\r\nstrength to nearly 100,000 men. This number fluctuated to some extent,\r\nfor at least two divisions were drawn off from the siege to reinforce\r\nOyama at the battle of the Sha-ho; but at no time can the total forces\r\nbefore Port Arthur have been less than 60,000, and then superiority in\r\nnumbers to the defence gradually increased until from a proportion of\r\ntwo to one, it had reached the proportion of six or seven to one. This\r\ngrowing disparity, of course, was due to the fact that while the\r\nJapanese could replenish their exhausted ranks, the Russian garrison\r\ncould not fill the gaps caused by wounds and sickness; while a further\r\nreduction of at least 5,000 men in the forces at Stoessel's command was\r\nmade by the naval sortie on August 10th. That feat, of course, deprived\r\nPort Arthur of the services of the crews of all the vessels that\r\nescaped to neutral ports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE SCALING FORT AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Forts]\r\n\r\nIn the great assault of the 19th-26th August the Japanese lost 14,000\r\nmen, and succeeded only in capturing the Banjushan fort, which is east\r\nof the Urlungshan forts. General Nogi then settled down to steady siege\r\noperations, drawing his parallels nearer and nearer to the Russian main\r\nposition, and capturing the all-important Kuropatkin fort early in\r\nSeptember. This fort, which stands on Division Hill half-way between\r\nWolf Hill and the harbor, not only commanded the parade-ground, but\r\ngave the Japanese the possession of the waterworks from which the\r\ngarrison drew the main water supply. Up to this moment General Nogi's\r\nheaviest guns had been 4.7 and 6in. pieces of the naval type, and they\r\nhad been quite unequal to the heavy guns of the position mounted in the\r\nRussian works. But now heavy siege guns and 11in. howitzers arrived\r\nfrom Japan, and immediately their effect began to make itself felt, so\r\nthat by the 19th September another assault was resolved on. This was\r\ndirected against three points of the ring of defensive works--against\r\nthe metre-hill forts on the west, and (the outworks, as it were of the\r\ngreat Etseshan and Antszshan forts) against the advanced works of\r\nUrlungshan on the northeast, and against the lunettes in the Shuishi\r\nValley which connects the Antszshan and the Urlungshan forts. At this\r\nlast point some of the fiercest fighting of the whole siege took place.\r\nThe Shuishi Valley was defended by a series of strong lunettes\r\nconnected by advance works, within fifty yards of which the Japanese\r\nhad advanced their parallels. On the evening of the 19th September four\r\ndesperate assaults were delivered against the westernmost lunette. All,\r\nhowever, were beaten back. At dawn the assault was renewed with greater\r\nstrength, and the western lunette was carried, mainly by the employment\r\nof dynamite grenades. The Russian garrison were driven out of the\r\ntrenches, losing three quick-firers, four machine guns, and two\r\nmortars, but inflicting on the victors losses amounting to over 400\r\nkilled and wounded. At the same time a determined assault was made on\r\n203 Metre Hill and the adjoining ridge by three regiments of the right\r\ndivision. The assaulting parties reached the dead ground beneath the\r\nridge, but there they were compelled to remain during the night. At\r\ndawn on the 20th a terrific bombardment on the position began and\r\ncontinued till evening; and when the night had fallen the Japanese\r\nrushed the trenches on the eastern extremity of the crest line after a\r\nfierce hand-to-hand fight in which not only bayonets but even stones\r\nwere used. But only part of the work had been won. The fort on the\r\nsouthwestern slopes of the ridges was still untaken, and though a small\r\nparty of the besiegers penetrated the defences here, they were driven\r\nout again next day, and four more assaults delivered during the next\r\ntwo days proved equally unavailing though terribly costly in life--the\r\ncasualty list at this point alone amounting to 2,000. The defences of\r\nthis advance fort on 203 Metre Hill were typical of the obstacles which\r\nthe Japanese had to overcome in the prosecution of their assaults. The\r\nbomb-proofs connecting the network of trenches which seared the slopes\r\nof the hill were made of steel plates covered with earth, and a triple\r\nrow of wire entanglements made the ground in front of the trenches\r\nimpassable. In the operations from the 19th to the 26th September the\r\nJapanese lost more than 4,000 killed and wounded. In the assault at the\r\nsame time on the advanced works of Urlungshan the parallels of the\r\nJapanese had been carried to within fifty yards of the defences, but\r\nthe assault still proved a costly business. Again and again the\r\nassaulting rushes were swept back by rifle and machine-gun fire; but\r\nthe indomitable spirit of the Mikado's troops at length prevailed, and\r\nthe redoubt was carried at the point of the bayonet. The position thus\r\ngained in front of Urlungshan enabled the Japanese to mount their heavy\r\nhowitzers in such a way as to bombard not only the main forts but the\r\nharbor with great effect; and in the course of a few days several of\r\nthe warships lying at anchor were severely damaged by the high-angle\r\nfire. By hard fighting and diligent sapping the investing army now\r\ncontinued to make steady progress against the Urlungshan forts which\r\nlie just east of the road and railway and command their approach to\r\nPort Arthur. On the 10th October the attack managed to establish itself\r\non the crest of the East Urlungshan fort, and on the 16th the\r\nentrenched hill between Urlungshan and Banjushan, the latter of which\r\nwas already in Japanese hands, was taken by storm. On the 25th October\r\nthe glacis of East Urlungshan was stormed and held in spite of repeated\r\ncounter-attacks on the part of the Russians. In front of these forts on\r\nthe northeastern side the fiercest fighting continued all through the\r\nlatter part of October and the early part of November, the general\r\nresult being that the Japanese saps were brought within less than 300\r\nyards of the main positions while the fire from the howitzers finally\r\nsilenced the great forts of Urlungshan and Shunshusan. But these\r\nsuccesses, though considerable, were insufficient to make a really\r\nserious breach in the main lines of the defence, as long as the great\r\nforts on the west--Antszshan and Etseshan--held out, and forthwith the\r\nJapanese attack was diverted to the latter of those two strongholds.\r\nMeanwhile, the heavy and incessant fire directed on the harbor and the\r\ntown had been most destructive. The naval repairing works had to be\r\nabandoned, and both the old and the new Chinese towns were rendered\r\nuninhabitable where their buildings were not razed to the ground or\r\nconsumed by the fires started by the bursting shells.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devices of the Besiegers]\r\n\r\nFor the first time in history a fortress constructed according to the\r\nlatest principles of military science, and defended by modern\r\nlong-range artillery, was being besieged; and like the old walled\r\ncities of the 17th and 18th centuries, its defences could only be\r\novercome by sap and mine and parallel. So much the assailants had\r\nlearnt to their cost in their earlier and futile attempts at taking the\r\nplace by storm. The exigencies of these operations led to the adoption\r\nof many ingenious devices by the forces on both sides--such, for\r\ninstance, as a steel bullet-proof shield to protect the pioneer engaged\r\nin cutting wire entanglements; and the deadly grenade charged with\r\ndynamite, flung into the enemy's trenches by the hand or by means of\r\nwooden mortars bound with bamboo. At first the Japanese had chosen the\r\nnight time for their assaults, but this plan had to be abandoned owing\r\nto the effective employment by the Russians of searchlights and star\r\nshells, the former having the effect not only of exposing the\r\nassaulting troops to the fire of the defenders, but blinding them in\r\ntheir advance on their objective. Throughout the siege the defenders\r\nhad shown not only indomitable courage, but inexhaustible resource, and\r\nin spite of all the discouragement which the steady and inexorable\r\nadvance of the Japanese might have been supposed to inflict, they\r\ncontinued equal to every demand on their fortitude. From time to time\r\nsupplies reached them by means of blockade-runners, but this was but a\r\nprecarious and inadequate means of replenishing the stores on which\r\nsuch a long and severe strain had been made. And yet, in spite of all\r\nrumors to the effect that ammunition was running short, the great guns\r\ncontinued to hurl their defiance at the Japanese artillery, and never\r\nin any single instance was the defence weakened by a failure of powder\r\nand shot. Though the Russians had failed to foresee many things which\r\nthe course of the war has proved to have been fairly obvious, no one\r\ncan pretend that they failed to equip their great stronghold in the Far\r\nEast in a manner worthy of its claim to rank as \"the Gibraltar of the\r\nEast.\" After nearly six months of close investment and almost\r\ncontinuous bombardment, the fortress still held at bay an enemy who had\r\nproved himself, not only before the defences of Port Arthur, but in\r\nmany a stricken field beside, to possess fighting qualities rarely\r\nequalled and never surpassed in the world's history of warfare--an\r\nenemy, too, who possessed every resource of military science, and who\r\nhad studied in the best military schools. The fact that the Japanese,\r\nwho had confidently expected to take Port Arthur before the end of the\r\nsummer had not even by the middle of November made a decisive breach in\r\nits main defences, speaks volumes for the character of those defences.\r\nBut even the strongest fortifications that human ingenuity can\r\nconstruct are only formidable when men of high spirit man them; and the\r\nchief credit for having baffled so long the most desperate efforts of\r\nJapanese skill and courage must ever be given to General Stoessel and\r\nthe men who, serving under him, became infected with his spirit and\r\ninspired by his example. By the middle of November the Japanese lines\r\nhad, indeed, been drawn very close round the devoted citadel of the\r\nCzar. They were in possession of the eastern ridge, and held\r\npractically at their mercy that great ring of fortified hills which\r\nshuts in Port Arthur from the Dalny side. They had cut the main water\r\nsupply of the garrison, and they had possessed themselves of important\r\nground to the north of the old town, and their siege guns were able to\r\nrender the dockyards and the harbor untenable for ships of war. To the\r\nwest the advance had been less signal, and their foothold on the great\r\nridge which commands the fortress on the western side was at best\r\nslight and precarious; while not even the faintest impression had been\r\nmade on the great chain of fortifications at Liau-tie-shan, in the\r\nextreme south corner of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Undaunted Stoessel]\r\n\r\nTremendous efforts had been made to achieve the capture of the place by\r\nthe 3rd November, the birthday of the Mikado; but that auspicious day\r\npassed without the fall of Port Arthur seeming to be in any degree\r\nnearer, while General Stoessel continued to send cheerful and undaunted\r\nmessages to his Imperial master whenever a boat succeeded in running\r\nthe blockade of the Japanese fleet and in reaching Chifu. Through all\r\nthese protracted and strenuous operations, the losses of the Japanese\r\nhad been very severe; they cannot have been less than 40,000 men, and\r\nthey may have been considerably more. The garrison had suffered less\r\nseverely, but in the absence of reserves their losses were even more\r\nserious, and by the middle of November the total effective force was\r\nlittle more than 10,000 men. It will ever be a mystery how a force so\r\nutterly inferior to its enemy, defending, a wide perimeter of\r\nfortifications, every point of which was daily liable to fierce assault\r\nand bombardment, could for so many weeks endure the awful strain to\r\nwhich it was subjected. Yet the indomitable garrison was never\r\nquiescent or passive in its resistance. Besides repelling assault, it\r\nengaged in continual sorties and counter-attacks, and often, when\r\ndriven from an essential position succeeded in recapturing it at the\r\npoint of the bayonet. A remarkable instance of this offensive capacity\r\nwas furnished in the course of the great assault from the 19th\r\nSeptember to the 26th September. In operating from the north against\r\nthe defences of the Shuishi Valley, which lies between Antszshan and\r\nUrlungshan, the Japanese, after their first success, pressed on against\r\nHigh Hill, a position of the most vital importance to the defence, as\r\nit permitted the principal forts on the west of the town to be taken in\r\nreverse. As any attempt to retake the hill must be a desperate\r\nenterprise, General Stoessel refused to issue an order for its\r\nrecapture, but called for volunteers. The requisite number were at once\r\nforthcoming, and led by Lieutenant Podgorsky, they attacked the\r\nJapanese with grenades and drove them from the position which they had\r\nalready begun to entrench.\r\n\r\nIn his dispatch of the 23rd September, this is how General Stoessel\r\nreports the affair:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gallant Podgorsky]\r\n\r\n\"The last assault on High Hill was repulsed to-day at 5 o'clock in the\r\nmorning. The enemy had actually occupied some of the defences of the\r\nHigh Hill position and had placed machine-guns in them, which they\r\ndirected against our troops. Lieutenant Podgorsky was dispatched to\r\nthis part of the field by General Kondrachenko with a force of\r\nchasseurs and engineers, who under the direction of Colonel Irmann\r\nhurled grenades filled with pyroxiline into the works held by the\r\nJapanese. These exploded among the enemy, who fled in panic. Captain\r\nSytcheff, of the 5th Regiment, pursued the flying foe with chasseurs.\r\nColonel Irmann attributes the principal share in the work of compelling\r\nthe enemy to withdraw entirely from High Hill to Lieutenant Podgorsky.\r\nThe Japanese lost over 10,000 men. All our troops distinguished\r\nthemselves. General Kondrachenko, Colonel Irmann, Captain Sytcheff, and\r\nLieutenant Podgorsky won special distinction. The troops fought\r\nheroically, particularly the 5th Regiment. The whole garrison down to\r\nthe last man is resolved to defend Russia's bulwark in the Far East to\r\nthe last drop of blood.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: World-wide Admiration]\r\n\r\nBut even the greatest heroism cannot achieve the impossible; and in\r\nspite of Stoessel's persistent optimism, it became evident that his\r\npowers of resistance were daily diminishing. An attempt on the part of\r\nthe Japanese General to induce the garrison to capitulate in spite of\r\ntheir leader, met with no response; but throughout the civilized world,\r\nwhose sympathy and admiration had been deeply stirred by the heroic\r\nstand of Port Arthur's garrison, voices were lifted to urge that no\r\nmore useless sacrifice of noble life should be permitted; and that the\r\nmen who had done so much for the honor of the Czar should be spared at\r\nleast the last mortal agony of the struggle with the inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uncertain News]\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, however, a Russian torpedo-boat bearing dispatches from\r\nStoessel managed to elude the blockade and to reach Chifu, pursued by\r\nJapanese destroyers. The boat was warned that it must leave the neutral\r\nharbor within twenty-four hours or be disarmed, and rather than submit\r\nto either of these alternatives, the officer in command blew his vessel\r\nup. But his work had been done; and his dispatches containing the\r\nlatest accounts of the position at Port Arthur reached St. Petersburg.\r\nImmediately afterwards the report arrived that General Kuropatkin had\r\nbeen empowered to treat for terms of capitulation for Port Arthur. But\r\nwhether that was in fact the result of Stoessel's message, or whether\r\nthe Czar's Government received from it encouragement in the belief that\r\nPort Arthur could hold out till the arrival of the Baltic Fleet, is a\r\nquestion which is still unanswered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REMNANT OF A REGIMENT--AFTER THE BATTLE OF THE\r\nSHA-HO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  The North Sea Outrage--Seizures of Neutrals--The Case of the\r\n    \"Malacca\"--The Baltic Fleet--Departure at Last--Russian\r\n    Alarms--In the North Sea--Bringing Home the News--Russian\r\n    Allegations--Naval Preparations--Supplementary Information--The\r\n    Baltic Fleet Proceeds to Madagascar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The North Sea Outrage]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the echoes of the terrific battle of the Sha-ho begun to\r\nsubside than the attention of the civilized world, which had so long\r\nbeen concentrated on the vicissitudes of the Titanic struggle in the\r\nFar East, was suddenly focussed on a spot separated from the theatre of\r\nwar by more than half the circumference of the globe, and on an\r\nincident fraught, as it seemed, with more direful and tremendous\r\nconsequences even than the momentous rupture between Russia and Japan.\r\nOn the 15th of October, Russia's Baltic Fleet--which for many months\r\nhad been preparing as a reinforcement to the Pacific Squadron--at last\r\nleft port on its voyage to the Far East; and within six days of its\r\ndeparture it had so effectually asserted itself as a factor in the\r\nnaval situation that Europe, shocked and startled, woke up one morning\r\nto find itself hanging on the perilous brink of that Armageddon which\r\nhas been the nightmare of statesmen for the last twenty years. In\r\npassing through the North Sea, the Russian fleet--for causes which have\r\nyet to be fully elicited--fired on a flotilla of British fishing-boats\r\nengaged in trawling on the Dogger Bank; killed and wounded several of\r\nthe fishermen; sunk one of the trawlers, and more or less grievously\r\ninjured others. When the news of this amazing outrage was published a\r\nstorm of indignation and resentment swept over England such as has not\r\nbeen known for more than a generation; and feeling was embittered and\r\nintensified to a truly dangerous pitch, first by the callous\r\nindifference displayed by the perpetrators of the outrage, and next by\r\nthe indisposition of the Russian Government to offer those immediate\r\napologies and amends which alone could palliate so wanton a breach of\r\nthe comity of nations. It seemed for the moment that Russia had\r\ndeliberately designed to provoke England to hostilities, in the hope of\r\nredeeming her own desperate position by extending the area of the\r\nconflict and by dragging into it first the ally of Japan, and by\r\nconsequence her own ally, France. The prospect, though almost too\r\nterrible to contemplate, did not for a moment quench the resolution of\r\nthe people of England, where men of all parties were found standing\r\nshoulder to shoulder in the demand for ample reparation. What made the\r\nsituation especially dangerous was that public patience had at last\r\nbeen well-nigh exhausted by the repeated provocations of\r\nRussia--provocations which the North Sea outrage was only the crown and\r\nculmination. To understand this fact, it is necessary to go back a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizures of Neutrals]\r\n\r\nWhen Russia found that she could not hope successfully to contest the\r\nsupremacy of the sea with Japan, she turned her attention to the\r\nsubsidiary enterprise of commerce-raiding. In this task the\r\nVladivostock Squadron were particularly active, and, unsated by the\r\ndestruction of such Japanese transports and trading vessels as they\r\nencountered, seized or sunk many vessels flying neutral flags. On the\r\n16th of June the Vladivostock cruisers seized the _Allanton_, a British\r\nsteamer, carrying coal from Hokkaido Island to Singapore. There was\r\nnothing contraband in the cargo or destination of this vessel, as the\r\nsubsequent decision of the St. Petersburg Prize Court proved, yet the\r\n_Allanton_ was confiscated, and her crew held prisoners at Vladivostock\r\nfor months. The real reason for this high-handed conduct was that the\r\n_Allanton_ had previously carried a cargo of coal from Cardiff to\r\nJapan--but she had been chartered for that voyage before the outbreak\r\nof war. On the 16th of July the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company's\r\nsteamer, the _Hispang_, was wantonly sunk in Pigeon Bay by a Russian\r\ntorpedo-boat. The _Hispang_ was engaged in a lawful trade; there was no\r\nsuggestion that she carried contraband; and indeed no examination of\r\nher cargo was even attempted. She was flying the British flag, and she\r\nstopped directly she was ordered to do so. But in spite of these facts,\r\na Russian torpedo-boat came straight out to her and sunk her--the\r\ncaptain, officers, and passengers being rescued with difficulty. It was\r\nafterwards confessed by the Russian officer that did this deed that his\r\norders were given under the impression that the _Hispang_ was the\r\nsteamer _Haimum_, which was being employed by the London _Times_'\r\ncorrespondent. On the 26th of July an equally gross outrage was\r\nperpetrated by the Vladivostock Squadron, who, besides unjustifiably\r\nseizing the _Chalcas_, deliberately sunk on the 23rd of July the\r\nBritish steamer _Knight Commander_. This vessel was carrying rails for\r\nJapan; and even if such a cargo could be regarded as contraband, there\r\nwas no excuse for sinking the vessel. Such an act, in the words of Mr.\r\nBalfour and Lord Lansdowne, constituted \"a grave breach of\r\ninternational law\"; and it was aggravated by the circumstances in which\r\nit was committed. The captain and crew were ordered to get clear of the\r\nvessel in ten minutes, and such was the haste with which they were\r\ncompelled to leave the boats in order to save their lives, that nearly\r\nall the personal effects had to be sacrificed. The growing irritation\r\nwith these acts was brought to a head in England by the famous case of\r\nthe _Malacca_--a P. and O. mail steamship which was seized by Russian\r\ncruisers in the Red Sea on the 19th July. At the beginning of June two\r\nvessels of the Russian Volunteer Fleet in the Black Sea--the\r\n_Petersburg_ and the _Smolensk_--were \"designated for Government\r\nservice outside the Black Sea.\" Even their commanders were kept in the\r\ndark as to their destination and the nature of the service that they\r\nwere to perform. The two vessels, which, as warships, would not by\r\ninternational treaty have been able to leave the Black Sea, passed\r\nthrough the Dardanelles under the commercial flag, and then steered\r\nstraight to the Suez Canal, where the non-belligerent character was\r\nstill maintained. But it seems that on reaching Constantinople the\r\ncommanders had been informed that their ships had been raised to the\r\nrank of second-class cruisers in the Russian fleet; and no sooner had\r\nthe Red Sea been reached than the _Petersburg_ and the _Smolensk_ put\r\noff their commercial disguise and put on the character of ships of war.\r\nThey flew the naval flag, and mounted the armament of 5in.\r\nquick-firers, which had been up to that moment securely stowed away.\r\nThe Government service for which they had been designated was that of\r\nsearching for contraband on neutral vessels, and the _soi-disant_\r\ncruisers lost no time in demonstrating their zeal. All this time, by\r\nthe way, the Russian Admiralty was strenuously denying that the\r\n_Petersburg_ and the _Smolensk_ had left the Black Sea at all. On the\r\n15th July the commerce-raiders began operations, rather tactlessly, by\r\nstopping and seizing the German mail steamer, _Prinz Heinrich_, and by\r\nconfiscating the Japanese mails. The indignation and astonishment of\r\nthe German public had only begun to make itself heard, when it was\r\ndistracted by the intelligence that the P. and O. steamer _Malacca_ had\r\nalso been stopped, and had been actually brought back to Suez in charge\r\nof a Russian prize crew. The vessel, flying the Russian flag, reached\r\nSuez on the 19th July, and on the 20th the English Government, moved\r\nthereto by the clamor which began to be heard both in Parliament and in\r\nthe press, addressed to the Government of the Czar a strongly-worded\r\nprotest against the seizure and a demand that the _Malacca_ should be\r\ninstantly released. The demand was based on the irregular position of\r\nthe _Petersburg_--a vessel which, if a ship of war, ought not to have\r\npassed the Dardanelles, and which, if not a ship of war, had no right\r\nto stop and search neutral vessels. This contention was unanswerable;\r\nfor it is evident that if a ship could be permitted to change its\r\ncharacter at will, it could perform all the functions of a ship of war\r\nand still enjoy all the privileges of a non-belligerent at neutral\r\nports.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Case of the \"Malacca\"]\r\n\r\nIncidentally it was pointed out in Lord Lansdowne's dispatch that the\r\nammunition found on board the _Malacca_ belonged to the British\r\nGovernment, and was intended for the China Squadron. It subsequently\r\ncame to light that the seizure of the _Malacca_ was no mere accident;\r\nbut that the vessel had been waited for by the Russian cruisers acting\r\non secret information from Russian agents at Antwerp. For several days\r\nno reply was vouchsafed by the Russian Government, and feeling in this\r\ncountry rose to such a height that the situation became dangerous.\r\nWhile the whole British nation was chafing under the indignity and\r\naffront, the _Malacca_ was being navigated by her prize crew, with\r\nalmost deliberate insolence, through the Suez Canal on the way to the\r\nBaltic port of Libau. A British liner, in the eyes of the whole world,\r\nwas made an ignominious captive, and, like a pickpocket in the clutch\r\nof a police-constable, was dragged away to judgment. The humiliation of\r\nthe situation was aggravated by the fact that at Suez--a port of the\r\nEnglish Protectorate of Egypt--the Russian officer in charge of the\r\n_Malacca_ demanded to be supplied with coal, water, and provisions. In\r\nspite of the strong representations which had been made by the British\r\nGovernment, nothing was done at St. Petersburg to alleviate the\r\nsituation. The _Malacca_ reached Suez on the 19th of July and Port Said\r\non the 20th, and on the 21st she sailed unconcernedly for her\r\ndestination, which was ostentatiously announced to be Libau. Then at\r\nlast the Russian Government broke the silence. Having inflicted the\r\ngreatest possible humiliation on this country, they were pleased to\r\naccept the assurances of the British Government that the prize had no\r\ncontraband on board, and to consent that the _Malacca_ should not be\r\nbrought before a Prize Court. A claim for damages for detention was to\r\nbe admitted, and the vessel was to be handed over to the British\r\nauthorities at \"some Mediterranean port,\" after formal examination in\r\nthe presence of the British Consul. On the 27th July the terms of this\r\nagreement--so extravagantly indulgent to Russia--were carried out, and\r\nthe incident of the _Malacca_ closed; but there remained still\r\nunsettled the fundamental question of the status of the volunteer\r\ncruisers, _Smolensk_ and _Petersburg_. Meanwhile, for the German liner\r\n_Scandia_, which had been seized on the 23rd July, very different\r\ntreatment was reserved--she was released on the following day. The only\r\npublic recognition of the protests of the British Government which was\r\ngiven by the Government of the Czar was the publication on the 3rd\r\nAugust of an official communication declaring that \"the special\r\ncommission\" of the cruisers _Petersburg_ and _Smolensk_ had \"expired;\"\r\nand these vessels promptly disappeared from the Red Sea. But their\r\nmischievous career was not yet at an end. Although the Russian\r\nGovernment had specifically promised that they should not be employed\r\nin searching neutral shipping any longer, the world was startled at the\r\nend of August to learn that the British steamer _Comedian_ had been\r\nstopped 80 miles from East London and 10 miles only from the coast of\r\nBritish territory by a mysterious Russian cruiser. The unpleasant\r\nimpression in England was deepened when it was discovered that this\r\nstrange cruiser was no other than the _Smolensk_ of Red Sea fame. Well\r\nmight Mr. Balfour, who received at this moment a deputation of British\r\nshipowners, declare that the incident had produced \"a painful\r\nimpression\" in the minds of the English Government. Representations to\r\nthe Russian Government produced the characteristic excuse that the\r\nmessages sent to the _Smolensk_ and _Petersburg_ had not reached their\r\ndestination. There is, indeed, good reason to believe that the Russian\r\nAdmiralty, which had done its best to thwart the Russian Foreign\r\nOffice, had taken particularly good care that the messages should be\r\ndelayed until the _Petersburg_ and _Smolensk_ were out of reach. But\r\nrealizing the gravity of the situation, and protesting their own\r\nhelplessness, the Russian Government now invited the British Government\r\nitself to communicate to the raiders a cypher message of recall.\r\nAccordingly the cruisers on the Cape Station were sent out to find the\r\ndelinquents; and on the 5th September they were discovered coaling in\r\nthe territorial waters of Zanzibar with German colliers in attendance.\r\nTheir whereabout was at any rate sufficiently well known for them to\r\ncommand the means to replenish their bunkers, and as soon as they saw a\r\nBritish warship, they prepared for instant flight. But H.M.S. _Forte_\r\nmanaged to communicate to them the orders of their own Government, and\r\nas these were too unequivocal to be disregarded, the raiding career of\r\nthe _Petersburg_ and _Smolensk_ forthwith came to an end. But they had\r\ndone enough, in conjunction with the Vladivostock Squadron, to rouse\r\nfeeling in England to a high pitch of irritation; and to make it\r\nill-prepared to endure with patience or forbearance the greater and\r\nstill more wanton outrage with which the Baltic Fleet was to inaugurate\r\nits voyage to the Far East.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Baltic Fleet]\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of this fleet had been the feverish pre-occupation of the\r\nRussian Admiralty from the moment that the first disasters befell the\r\nPacific Squadron at Port Arthur. Naval reinforcements were on the way,\r\nit will be remembered, at the outbreak of war, and had reached the Red\r\nSea; but they were recalled when the news of the successful torpedo\r\nattack on the Port Arthur Fleet reached Europe. It was realized how\r\nvital must be the command of the sea to the achievement of victory; and\r\nRussia at once set about preparing an Armada which should restore to\r\nher the naval preponderance so suddenly lost. At first the intention,\r\nwhich was so loudly proclaimed, was not taken quite seriously; but it\r\nwas decidedly encouraged as the weeks went on and as the resisting\r\npower of Port Arthur to assault gave hopes that the new fleet might\r\nstill find a warm-water port to receive it. At first the departure of\r\nthe Baltic Fleet was announced for June; though everyone knew the\r\ndesign, only formed perhaps to reassure public opinion in Russia, was\r\nincapable of fulfilment. Then June came, and the date of departure was\r\nagain postponed; and in July the world was informed that there was \"no\r\nhurry;\" and that it had been thought advisable to \"test thoroughly\" the\r\nnew ships and to familiarize the officers and crews with their work.\r\nAll through the summer the game of fixing the day of departure and then\r\npostponing it went merrily on; but on the 15th August Admiral\r\nRozhestvensky, on whom supreme command of the fleet had been bestowed,\r\nwent on board the flagship with his staff; and received from the Port\r\nAdmiral at Kronstadt by signal a formal message of farewell. But\r\nnothing more happened, except that on the 20th August it was announced\r\nthat the Baltic Fleet would not leave before the 28th September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGE SIEGE GUNS BEFORE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Departure at Last]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th August the fleet went for a trial trip with the most\r\ndiscouraging results, for several of the new ships broke down and the\r\nbattleship _Orel_ ran aground, inflicting structural injuries on\r\nherself. Early in September there was another false alarm. Danish\r\npilots had been procured, and on the 11th September the fleet again put\r\nto sea; but it only got as far as the port of Libau, and the next news\r\nwas that it would remain there \"some weeks longer\" for firing practice\r\nand manoeuvres. The next definite date fixed was the 7th October; but\r\ntwo days later than that the fleet had only got as far as Reval, where\r\nit was inspected and blessed by the Czar in person. On the 15th\r\nOctober, however, the long delay at last came to an end, and the fleet,\r\nconsisting of thirty-six vessels, actually left Russian waters.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to describe the fleet in which Russia had placed so\r\nmany of her hopes. The class and character of the principal vessels is\r\nbest realized from a table:--\r\n\r\n                       Displace- Indic'd  Nom'l      Gun      W'ght of\r\n                        ment in  horse-  speed in  Protec'n  b'side fire\r\n     BATTLESHIPS.        tons.   power.   knots.  in inches.   in lbs.\r\n\r\n     Kniaz Suvaroff\r\n       (flagship)       13,516   16,800     18       11.6       4,426\r\n     Alexander III      13,516   16,800     18       11.6       4,426\r\n     Borodino           13,516   16,800     18       11.6       4,426\r\n     Orel               13,516   16,800     18       11.6       4,426\r\n     Ossliabia          12,674   14,500     18       10.5       2,672\r\n     Sissoi Veliky\r\n       (flagship)        8,880   10,400     16       12.5       3,186\r\n     Navarin             9,476   18,206     16       12.5       3,404\r\n\r\n                       Displace- Indic'd  Nom'l      Gun      W'ght of\r\n                        ment in  horse-  speed in  Protec'n  b'side fire\r\n                         tons.   power.   knots.  in inches.   in lbs.\r\n\r\n     ARMORED CRUISERS.\r\n\r\n     Admiral Nakhimoff   8,500    9,000    16.7       6          944\r\n     Dmitri Donskoi      5,893    7,000     16       6.2         444\r\n\r\n     PROTECTED\r\n\r\n     Oleg                6,675   19,500     23        4          872\r\n     Aurora              6,630   11,600     20       4.5         632\r\n     Svietlana           3,828    8,500     20        4          476\r\n     Almaz               3,285    7,500     19        --         184\r\n     Jemtchug            3,200    7,000     24        --         184\r\n     Izumrud             3,200    7,000     24        --         184\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strength of Baltic Fleet]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these ships there was a torpedo flotilla of 7 destroyers\r\nof 28 knots speed, and 8 torpedo-boats; the following vessels of the\r\nVolunteer Fleet: _Kiev_, _Vladimir_, _Voronej_ (each of 10,500 tons and\r\nwith a speed of 12 knots), _Tambov_, and _Yawslar_ (each of 8,640 tons\r\nand with a speed of 12 knots); 13 transports armed with light guns; and\r\na hospital ship, the _Orel_--not to be confused with the battleship of\r\nthe same name. On paper, at least, this was a very formidable fleet;\r\nbut its fighting efficiency appears much reduced on analysis. There\r\nwere four modern battleships of a powerful type and of homogeneous\r\ndesign; but their value is much discounted by the fact that some of\r\ntheir consorts are distinctly less powerful; and in naval warfare the\r\nmanoeuvring power of a fleet becomes that of its weakest item. This\r\nwas proved very signally on the occasion of the engagement between\r\nAdmiral Kamimura and the Vladivostock Squadron, when the Russian\r\ncruisers _Gromoboi_ and _Rossia_ suffered most severely from having to\r\nstand by the _Rurik_, the lame duck of the squadron. The _Ossliabia_,\r\nit is true was not much inferior to the battleships of the _Kniaz\r\nSuvaroff_ class. She was a sister ship to the _Peresviet_ and\r\n_Pobieda_, sunk in the harbor of Port Arthur, and was launched in 1898.\r\nBut the _Sissoi Veliky_ and the _Navarin_ both dated from 1891, and\r\nwere distinctly inferior in the all-important matter of speed, even\r\ntheir nominal speed never having been attained. The only armored\r\ncruisers with the Baltic Fleet--the _Admiral Nakhimoff_ and the _Dmiti\r\nDonskoi_--were barely entitled to their description, as they have a low\r\nspeed, light armor, and comparatively small gun power. Certainly they\r\nwere not fit, like the best armored cruisers of to-day, to lie in the\r\nline of battle. Some of the other cruisers were little more than armed\r\nmerchantmen, and none of them were formidable warships. Another\r\ncircumstance that detracted from the fighting value of this fleet was\r\nthe character of the officers and crews. All Russia's best and most\r\nhighly-trained sailors and marine engineers were sent out before the\r\nwar to the Pacific Squadron; and she had no adequate reserve to draw\r\non. The modern man-of-war's-man--whether he is in the engine-room or on\r\nthe gun-deck--is a highly specialized product, and he cannot be turned\r\nout at a moment's notice. Stokers, artificers, engineers, as well as\r\ntorpedo lieutenants, gunners, and even admirals, have to be carefully\r\ntrained for years before they become efficient, and the inefficiency\r\nand inexperience of the scratch crews and raw officers put on board the\r\nBaltic Fleet was the main cause of the long delay in that fleet's\r\ndeparture and of the disaster that occurred immediately after the start\r\nhad been made, and that nearly brought the voyage to a tragic and\r\nignominious conclusion. When all these circumstances were taken into\r\nconsideration, it became obvious that the Baltic Fleet was hopelessly\r\ninferior to the fleet which, on reaching Far Eastern waters, it would\r\nhave to encounter in order to wrest from the Japanese their command of\r\nthe sea. But one question, even more urgent than that of the fate which\r\nwould befall the fleet on arrival, was how it was to overcome the\r\ndifficulties of the voyage. Russia had no coaling stations; and coaling\r\nat sea from attendant colliers has not yet become a feasible operation\r\nfor a great fleet. The larger vessels would require from 5,000 to 6,000\r\ntons of coal each, and the smaller cruisers from 2,000 to 3,000 tons in\r\nthe course of a voyage of nearly 13,000 miles, occupying at least 100\r\ndays, and very possibly 30 days more. But the coaling difficulty proved\r\nless insuperable than it had appeared, and Russia's energy and\r\ningenuity in overcoming it were the first symptoms that she meant the\r\nBaltic Fleet to be taken seriously. Negotiations for the supply of coal\r\nwere opened with English firms; but our Foreign Office ruled that such\r\ncontracts would be an infringement of neutrality. The Germans, however,\r\nwere much more complaisant; and their attitude of \"benevolent\r\nneutrality,\" as Count Von Bulow called it, enabled them to meet all\r\ndemands of Russia. Large orders for English coal to be delivered to\r\nGerman consignees at neutral ports were received at Cardiff; and this\r\ncoal was then transferred to the ports at which the Baltic Fleet was to\r\ncall. According to the strict interpretation of international law these\r\nfacilities for coaling in port ought not to have been extended to the\r\nfleet of a belligerent. But Russia was a close neighbor of the Powers\r\nconcerned, and the ally of one of them, while her enemy was a long way\r\noff; and so it happened that Admiral Rozhdestvensky suffered no more\r\ninconvenience than if he had been engaged on a yachting cruise. He and\r\nhis fleet put into any port that they fancied, and stayed, practically,\r\nas long as they had a mind to!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Alarms]\r\n\r\nThe Baltic Fleet was divided into three divisions, and on the 16th-18th\r\nOctober the first division left Libau. The daring surprise attacks of\r\nthe Japanese torpedo-boats at Port Arthur had filled the minds of the\r\nRussian naval authorities with every kind of misgiving; and by some\r\nmeans not yet disclosed, they had become possessed of the idea that the\r\nJapanese meditated an attempt on the Baltic Fleet during its passage\r\nthrough the narrow waters of the Danish Straits and the North Sea.\r\nRumors of mysterious Japanese agents, endeavoring to charter vessels in\r\nobscure Danish and Norwegian ports filled the Russian newspapers. On\r\nthe 14th October Admiral Wirenius, the Chief of the Russian Admiralty,\r\nsolemnly declared to an interviewer that the narrow waters of the Belt\r\nand the Sound were particularly favorable for a surprise attack; that\r\nofficers of the Japanese Navy were known to have left for Europe; and\r\nthat there was reason to apprehend an attempt to throw mines in the\r\ntrack of the Russian Squadron in the Danish Straits. The state of\r\n\"nerves\" to which the Russian naval officers had been reduced by these\r\napprehensions was shown when, as the Russian fleet passed through the\r\nKattegat, an attempt was made to deliver to the Russian Admiral a\r\ncypher dispatch that had arrived from St. Petersburg. Two fishermen\r\nwere sent out with the dispatch in a motor-launch, but when their\r\nvessel approached the flagship the searchlights were turned on, and\r\nblank charges fired to forbid a nearer approach. The dispatch was taken\r\nin by a boat launched by the battleship for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the North Sea]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October the first division of the fleet passed through\r\nthe Kattegat; and by the 21st of October all the ships had left Danish\r\nwaters and entered on their course down the North Sea. Immediately\r\nfollowed an occurrence almost without parallel in naval history--an\r\noccurrence that was only saved from inextinguishable ridicule and\r\ncontempt by the tragic consequences which it unhappily involved. On\r\nthis memorable night of Friday, the 21st of October, some fifty vessels\r\nof the Hull fishing fleet were engaged in trawling on the Dogger\r\nBank--one of the places in the North Sea most frequented by the\r\nfishermen not only of Great Britain, but of Germany, Denmark, Holland\r\nand Norway. It is a prominent figure in all charts of the North Sea,\r\nand to every sailor and seafaring man its situation and character are\r\nperfectly familiar. The Hull fishermen, of the Gamecock and Great\r\nNorthern Fleets, had their trawls down and were thus deprived of the\r\npossibility of rapid movement, when about midnight they sighted a\r\nnumber of warships steaming from the northeast. At first they did not\r\nsuspect that it was the Russian Baltic Fleet that had come their way,\r\nbecause in that event the fleet must have been navigating some 40 miles\r\nout of the true course; but very soon their ignorance was enlightened.\r\nWhile the men were watching the passing warships, searchlights were\r\nsuddenly flashed on the trawlers, and then, to the horror and amazement\r\nof these innocent fishermen engaged peaceably in their lawful\r\noccupations, a sudden storm of shot and shell broke upon them from\r\nunknown men-of-war. The steam-trawler _Crane_ was sunk and its skipper\r\nand mate were decapitated by a shell, and all but one of the crew were\r\ninjured; while the trawlers _Moulmein_ and _Mino_ were seriously\r\ndamaged, the latter vessel having no fewer than sixteen holes in her.\r\nFrom the evidence given at the subsequent inquiries the following facts\r\nwere elicited: All the trawlers had their own lights up--namely, a\r\nlantern showing a white light ahead, a green light on the starboard\r\nside, a red light on the port side. Several vessels also had lights in\r\nthe fishing pound so that the men could work on deck. None of the\r\ntrawlers were without lights. As the approaching vessels came nearer\r\nthey were seen to signal to one another in a way that conveyed to the\r\nminds of the trawlers that they were warships. Some of the vessels were\r\nin advance of the others. The exact number was very difficult to tell,\r\nbut in the first division there were probably four or five. They passed\r\nthe trawlers to the westward, where the admiral's trawler, the _Ruff_,\r\nwas, and to the eastward of a few of the trawlers. One of them, at any\r\nrate, showed a searchlight. They passed on, and nothing happened. It\r\nwas noticed that they were signalling to the other vessels behind, and\r\nthat the other vessels were repeating the signals and signalling to\r\neach other. These other vessels then came on to the eastward of the\r\nadmiral's ship, _Ruff_, but there were trawlers on both sides of them.\r\nThen, without any warning to the trawlers, these vessels opened fire.\r\nThe crews on the trawlers were at first under the impression that it\r\nwas a sham fight in some manoeuvres, but they soon discovered that it\r\nwas live shot. Some of the warships fired from both port and starboard\r\nside. After the firing had begun, this second division of vessels came\r\nmore to the west, and there were others which came down more to the\r\neast. The third division, which came furthest to the eastward, came\r\nnear some of the outlying trawlers, who were more to the south and\r\neast. They turned their searchlights upon them. A great many of the\r\ntrawlers, in the attempt to get away from the firing when it began,\r\nlost their trawls or damaged them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRSTY JAPANESE TROOPS CROSSING THE SHA-HO.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bringing Home the News]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday night, the 23rd of October, two steam trawlers, one of them\r\nflying her flag at half-mast, and both riddled with shot, entered St\r\nAndrew's Dock at Hull. Their own condition, and the lifeless and\r\nmutilated bodies that they brought with them, were ghastly confirmation\r\nof the amazing tidings that they had to tell; and next morning, not\r\nonly England, but all the world, was ringing with the news of the\r\nBaltic fleet's first warlike exploit. Amazement quickly gave place to\r\nindignation--an indignation of passionate intensity; and with one voice\r\nthe people of England cried aloud for retribution at any cost on the\r\nperpetrators of so wanton an outrage. Nor was this indignation confined\r\nto the countrymen of the victims. In the United States, in France, and\r\neven in Germany, unsparing reprobation of a deed so unjustifiable was\r\nfreely uttered; and the belief was confidently expressed that the only\r\npossible explanation was to be found in the undiscipline and probable\r\ndrunken frenzy of the Russian naval officers. Be it remembered, too,\r\nthat the heinousness of the offence was infinitely increased by the\r\nfact that the Russian ships, whose commanders must have discovered\r\ntheir grievous blunder before leaving the neighborhood of the Dogger\r\nBank, made no effort to ascertain the injury they had inflicted, or to\r\nrender help to their innocent victims. Neither did the Russian Admiral\r\ncondescend to make the least report of the circumstances. He and his\r\nfleet proceeded on their way as if the sinking of fishing-boats and the\r\nslaughtering of fishermen were too trifling an incident to engage\r\nserious attention and notice; and when the news of the outrage reached\r\nLondon, the Baltic Squadron had already been sighted in the Channel. No\r\nGovernment could sit down under such provocation as this, and the\r\nEnglish ministers, who realized well enough the dangerous pitch to\r\nwhich public feeling had been wrought, lost no time in addressing the\r\nstrongest demands for immediate redress to St. Petersburg, accompanied\r\nby the intimation that the situation was one not admitting of delay.\r\nTheir action was emphasized by that of King Edward himself, who, in\r\nsending a subscription of 200 guineas for the relief of the sufferers,\r\ndeclared that he had heard with profound sorrow of the \"unwarrantable\r\naction\" to which the North Sea fishing-fleet had been subjected. The\r\nprincipal witnesses of the outrage were summoned at once to the Foreign\r\nOffice, and Lord Lansdowne had long audience of the King, while the\r\nPrime Minister, who happened to be in Scotland, came back post-haste to\r\nLondon. On the 25th of October Count Lamsdorff, the Russian Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, called at the British Embassy in St. Petersburg\r\nand requested the British Ambassador, Sir Charles Hardinge, to convey\r\nto King Edward and the British Government a message from the Czar, who,\r\nwhile he had received no message from the Admiral in command of the\r\nBaltic Fleet, could only attribute \"the incident in the North Sea to a\r\nvery regrettable misunderstanding\". It was added that the Czar wished\r\nto express his sincere regret for the sad loss of life that had\r\noccurred, and to say that he would take steps to afford complete\r\nsatisfaction to the sufferers as soon as the circumstances of the case\r\nwere cleared up. These assurances, though far from adequate, would have\r\ndone something to calm the temper of public opinion in England if they\r\nhad been accompanied by any sign of a similar spirit in the Czar's\r\nadvisers. But the latter seemed inclined to be as intractable as the\r\nRussian press was impenitent. While the Russian Government pursued a\r\npolicy of delay and evasion, the Russian newspapers roundly denied that\r\nany blame attached to the Baltic Fleet, and scouted all idea of\r\nreparation; and all the time Admiral Rozhdestvensky was proceeding\r\nserenely on his voyage. On the 26th of October his battleships arrived\r\nat Vigo Harbor, where at last he took the trouble to communicate his\r\nreport of what had happened to St. Petersburg. The statement is such an\r\namazing one that it may be given in full. It was communicated to the\r\nworld under the authority of the Russian Naval General Staff, and ran\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"1.--The incident in the North Sea was provoked by two torpedo-boats\r\nwhich, without showing any lights, under cover of darkness, advanced to\r\nattack the vessel steaming at the head of the detachment. When the\r\ndetachment began to sweep the sea with its searchlights and opened\r\nfire, the presence was also discovered of several small steam vessels\r\nresembling small steam fishing-boats. The detachment endeavored to\r\nspare these boats and ceased fire as soon as the torpedo-boats were out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\n\"The English press is horrified at the idea that the torpedo-boats of\r\nthe squadron, left by detachment until the morning on the scene of the\r\noccurrence, did not render assistance to the victims. Now, there was\r\nnot a single torpedo-boat with the detachment and none were left on the\r\nscene of the occurrence. In consequence, it was one of the two\r\ntorpedo-boats which was not sunk, but which was only damaged, which\r\nremained until the morning near the small steam craft. The detachment\r\ndid not assist the small steam craft because it suspected them of\r\ncomplicity, in view of their obstinate persistence in cutting the line\r\nof advance of the warships. Several of them did not show any lights at\r\nall. The others showed them very late.\r\n\r\n\"2.--Having met several hundreds of fishing-boats, the squadron showed\r\nthem every consideration, except where they were in company of the\r\nforeign torpedo-boats, one of which disappeared, while the other,\r\naccording to the evidence of the fishermen themselves, remained among\r\nthem until the morning. They believed her to be a Russian vessel, and\r\nwere indignant that she did not come to the assistants of the victims.\r\nShe was, however, a foreigner, and remained until the morning looking\r\nfor the other torpedo-boat, her companion, either with the object of\r\nrepairing her damage or from fear of betraying herself to those who\r\nwere not accomplices.\r\n\r\n\"If there were also on the scene of the occurrence fishermen\r\nimprudently involved in this enterprise, I beg, in the name of the\r\nwhole fleet, to express our sincere regret for the unfortunate victims\r\nof circumstances in which no warship could, even in time of profound\r\npeace, have acted otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Preparations]\r\n\r\nBut before this preposterous and long-delayed explanation was\r\nvouchsafed, the British Government had taken steps to prove that they\r\nwere not in the mood to be trifled with, and that the subjects of the\r\ngreatest naval power in the world were not to be shot down with\r\nimpunity. To the intense satisfaction of the whole nation, an instant\r\nmobilization of the British fleets in European waters was ordered. The\r\nHome Fleet, which had been cruising away to the north of Scotland, was\r\nordered south; the Channel Fleet, lying at Gibraltar, was warned to be\r\nin instant readiness for active service; and the Mediterranean Fleet\r\nwas instructed to join up with the Channel Fleet with all speed. The\r\nnaval dockyards were kept working night and day to prepare the reserve\r\nfleet for commission, and to be ready for the demands which an\r\nimmediate outbreak of war might involve. In forty-eight hours every\r\nrequisite preparation had been completed, and three fleets, any one of\r\nthem capable of dealing faithfully with Admiral Rozhdestvensky's\r\nsquadron, were ready for instant action. Directly in the path of the\r\nBaltic Fleet, now assembled at Vigo, lay the Channel Fleet under the\r\ncommand of Lord Charles Beresford, and so acute was the crisis that it\r\nseemed as if at any moment that fleet might be ordered to take the sea.\r\nAmong the secret preparations made was the dispatch of four battleships\r\nfrom the Channel Squadron at Gibraltar to Portland and the assembly of\r\nall available submarines at Dover. What made the situation especially\r\ndangerous was the conflict which in this hour of desperate emergency\r\nwas being waged between the Russian Admiralty and the Russian Foreign\r\nOffice. The former department, which had done so much to aggravate the\r\ncase of the _Malacca_ and to flout the assurances which had been given\r\nas to the withdrawal of the _Petersburg_ and _Smolensk_, was now\r\ndetermined that no surrender should be made to the British demands for\r\nsatisfaction in the matter of the North Sea outrage; and for several\r\ndays the more pacific Foreign Office wrestled with these fire-eaters in\r\nvain. War between England and Russia, with the prospect of indefinite\r\nextension to other countries, seemed inevitable; but thanks largely to\r\nthe friendly offices of the French Government, who, as the ally of\r\nRussia and the friend of Great Britain, had exceptional claims to act\r\nas an intermediary between the disputants, a settlement was at length\r\narrived at. On the 28th of October, Mr. Balfour was able to announce to\r\nthe world that that morning an agreement had been arrived at which\r\naverted all further apprehension of the rupture of peaceful relations.\r\nGreat Britain and Russia had consented to refer the case in dispute to\r\nan impartial International Tribunal of Inquiry; the terms of the\r\nConvention, which were signed after much further negotiation on the\r\n24th of November, being as follows:--\r\n\r\n1.--The Commission is to consist of five members, namely, officers of\r\nGreat Britain, Russia, the United States, and France. The fifth\r\nCommissioner is to be selected by agreement between them. If they\r\ncannot agree, the choice to be entrusted to the king of a country\r\nsubsequently to be determined upon.\r\n\r\n2.--The Commission is to report on all the circumstances relating to\r\nthe disaster and to establish the responsibility.\r\n\r\n3.--The Commission is to have power to settle all questions of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n4.--The parties bind themselves to supply the Commission with all\r\nnecessary information, facilities, &c.\r\n\r\n5.--The Commission is to meet at Paris as soon as possible after the\r\nsignature of the Convention.\r\n\r\n6.--The report of the Commission is to be officially communicated to\r\nthe respective Governments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Allegations]\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting part of Mr. Balfour's statement was that in\r\nwhich he examined and dealt with the justification which Admiral\r\nRozhdestvensky had put forward, and in particular with the allegation\r\nthat the Russian fleet had been attacked by torpedo-boats. This\r\nallegation, as Mr. Balfour pointed out, involved a charge of bad faith\r\non the part of Great Britain, and such a charge he indignantly\r\nresented. If only one torpedo-boat was sunk, what, he pertinently\r\nasked, had become of the other? The world did not require to be\r\nconvinced of the essential absurdity of this story; but the Russians\r\npersisted in it with determination. The most circumstantial narratives\r\nwere presently forthcoming from the four officers who had been detained\r\nto give evidence before the International Commission. One narrator\r\nstated that information of the presence of Japanese torpedo-boats in\r\nthe Norway fiords, and of the Japanese having hired fishing vessels in\r\nHull, Southampton, Hamburg, and Christiania, had been received by the\r\nRussians. He proceeded as follows: \"We lodged information of the\r\nJapanese intentions with the Governments of those countries where the\r\nJapanese were making their preparations, but it was only in Denmark and\r\nGermany that we found any readiness to interfere with them.... Before\r\nleaving the Scaw the Russians received a number of alarming messages\r\nfrom their agents. All these messages agreed in stating that in one\r\nvery deep Norwegian fiord four Japanese torpedo-boats had been seen,\r\nand that these vessels were afterwards observed a short distance to the\r\nwest of the Scaw. The Russians left the Scaw in the morning, proceeding\r\nin different divisions. All the torpedo craft went on ahead, in two\r\ndivisions, making for Cherbourg. Next came Admiral Folkersahm with the\r\nfour older battleships making for Tangier. The small cruisers were\r\nunder orders to proceed to Arosa, 40 miles north of Vigo, while the\r\nlarge cruisers with the transport _Kamchatka_, under the command of\r\nAdmiral Enquist, had instructions to make for Tangier like Admiral\r\nFolkersahm.\r\n\r\n\"Last of all we put to sea with the four best battleships, _Suvaroff_,\r\n_Alexander III._, _Borodino_, and _Orel_. Our destination was Brest,\r\nwhere we were to coal. Observe, therefore, that there was not with us a\r\nsingle torpedo-boat or a single small vessel. All such were far ahead\r\nof us.... On the 8th of October, at 8 o'clock in the evening, when it\r\nwas already quite dark, we received a wireless message stating that 30\r\nmiles behind us was the transport _Kamchatka_, which had fallen behind\r\nher consorts (the cruisers _Dmitri Donskoi_ and _Aurora_) in\r\nconsequence of an injury to her engines, and that several torpedo-boats\r\nwere following her closely, but had not discharged any torpedoes.\r\nAdmiral Enquist, who was in front with the two cruisers, was at once\r\nordered by wireless message to slacken speed and wait for the\r\n_Kamchatka_, or to continue his course in order not to expose himself\r\nto the torpedo-boats, which, of course, also received our messages, but\r\ndid not know from what spot they were sent. The Japanese, however,\r\nattempted to find out our whereabouts. While we were exchanging\r\nmessages with the _Kamchatka_ we suddenly received a succession of\r\ntelegrams, in excellent Russian, purporting to come from the\r\n_Kamchatka_: 'Where is the squadron?' 'Give your latitude and\r\nlongitude.' 'Where is the _Suvaroff_?' These telegrams appeared to us\r\nsuspicious, and, in order to assure ourselves that they were really\r\nsent by the _Kamchatka_, instead of answering we asked for the name of\r\none of the officers of the _Kamchatka_. To this no answer was returned,\r\nand we continued our conversation with the _Kamchatka_ in cypher. At\r\n12.55 A. M. we suddenly saw in front of us ... two long dark\r\nsilhouettes, emitting quantities of smoke and evidently steaming at high\r\nspeed. At the same time we saw a yellow-red rocket, such as is\r\ngenerally sent up by vessels in distress. A moment later a searchlight\r\nwas thrown upon us from ahead.... We at once turned our searchlights on\r\nthe torpedo-boats and opened fire on them. As soon as they saw that\r\nthey were discovered, they turned aside, but came under the fire of the\r\n_Alexander III._, _Borodino_, and _Orel_, which were following us.\r\nAbout the same time our searchlights began to fall from time to time on\r\nsome small vessels, apparently fishing craft, whose behavior, however,\r\nwas very suspicious. They showed no lights, there was not a man on\r\ntheir decks, and they obstinately remained under the bows of our ships,\r\nbarring their course. They were thus in a position to launch floating\r\nmines. In spite of this, however, the Admiral, as soon as he caught\r\nsight of them, ordered that the searchlights on board the _Suvaroff_\r\nshould be turned skywards, which was a signal to cease firing.\r\n\r\n\"To remain where we were after the torpedo-boats had disappeared in\r\norder to aid the steamers would have been the height of imprudence. We\r\nshould have risked the most formidable part of our fleet, and as there\r\nwere several steamers they were in a position to aid each other. As far\r\nas could be perceived, one of the enemy's torpedo-boats was sunk.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrator argued that either the fishing vessels were accomplices or\r\nthe Japanese took advantage of their proximity without their knowledge.\r\nHe inclined to the former alternative, and asked, \"Why Hull fishing\r\nboats so far from England--almost off the Danish coast?\"\r\n\r\nThe best commentary on this narrative was supplied by the Russian\r\nGovernment themselves, who, six weeks after the North Sea outrage,\r\npublished the following significant admission of facts, which had, of\r\ncourse, been perfectly well known to them almost from the first:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplementary Information]\r\n\r\n\"According to supplementary information from Admiral Rozhdestvensky\r\nconcerning the North Sea incident of the 21st of October, after the\r\n_Kniaz Suvaroff_ had ceased firing there suddenly appeared on the left\r\nof the ironclad division the two searchlights of the cruisers _Dmitri\r\nDonskoi_ and _Aurora_, lighting up the division. The _Dmitri Donskoi_\r\nshowed her night signals, whereupon for fear lest projectiles from the\r\nhindmost ships of the division should hit our own vessels, either\r\ndirectly or by ricochet, a general signal to cease fire was made from\r\nthe ironclad _Kniaz Suvaroff_, and was at once carried out. The whole\r\nof the firing lasted less than ten minutes. Communications by wireless\r\ntelegraph stated that five projectiles had struck the cruiser _Aurora_,\r\nsome ricocheting and others hitting her direct. Three were\r\n75-millimètre and two 47-millimètre shells. The chaplain was seriously\r\ninjured, and a petty officer was slightly wounded. The former\r\nsubsequently succumbed at Tangier.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGHT IN STREET OF LIN-SHIN-PU, BATTLE OF SHAK-KE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThis communication bears out the theory advanced in the first instance\r\nthat the Russians in the panic had mistaken their own ships for hostile\r\ntorpedo-boats, and had opened fire on the \"two long, dark silhouettes\r\nemitting quantities of smoke\" without stopping to ascertain what they\r\nbelonged to.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Baltic Fleet Proceeds to Madagascar]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Vigo, the Baltic Fleet divided into two squadrons--one\r\nproceeding down the West Coast of Africa, and the other through the\r\nSuez Canal. By the end of December (two months and a half from leaving\r\nLibau) they had completed barely one-half of their voyage; and by that\r\ntime, not only was Vladivostock frost-bound, but Port Arthur was\r\ndominated by Japanese guns, and the remnants of the Pacific Fleet lay\r\nshell-riddled on the mud of the harbor. Before the International\r\nCommission of Inquiry met for business, all hope of the Baltic Fleet's\r\nachieving any serious purpose had been dissipated; for while it was\r\nstill mustering at Madagascar, the news arrived that the fall of Port\r\nArthur was at last an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the Siege--Siege of Port Arthur--The Japanese\r\n    Progress--The Japs Attack Metre Hill--The Russian Fleet\r\n    between Two Fires--A Jap Hero--Tunnels and\r\n    Hand-grenades--The Japs Capture Urlungshan--The Surrender\r\n    of Port Arthur--\"Great Sovereign!

The progress of the siege, which had been veiled in\r\nobscurity during the earlier months of investment, owing to the\r\nseverity of the censorship, was suddenly and frankly revealed to the\r\nworld in the late autumn, and from that moment the salient incidents of\r\nthis thrilling drama could be followed almost from day to day. Winter's\r\nicy grip, which had brought to a pause the headlong train of the\r\ncampaign in Manchuria, caused no interruption to the implacable contest\r\nfor mastery between the heroic troops of General Nogi and the dauntless\r\ngarrison commanded by General Stoessel. Not for an instant was there\r\nthe least relaxation of effort on the part of the besiegers or of\r\nendurance on the part of the besieged. Rather was the resolution of\r\nboth combatants screwed to a higher pitch by the knowledge that time\r\nmight be the deciding factor in the conflict. The departure of the\r\nBaltic Fleet gave General Stoessel hopes of ultimate relief as the\r\nreward for holding on, and threatened General Nogi with the\r\nstultification of all his sacrifices. With Port Arthur remaining in\r\nRussian hands, the recovery by her of the command of the sea must\r\nalways be a menacing possibility for the Japanese; while the fall of\r\nPort Arthur meant not only the destruction of the last remnant of the\r\nRussian Pacific Squadron, but the loss of the only practicable base for\r\nany future naval operations. The whole Japanese plan of campaign must\r\nrest on a more or less precarious foundation as long as Russia had a\r\nfleet in being in Eastern seas, for the vital lines of sea\r\ncommunication must be liable to severance. With the Russian flag swept\r\nfrom its last refuge, Japan must remain invincible to the mightiest\r\narmies that Russia could assemble in Manchuria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nThe story of the siege of Port Arthur has already been related in this\r\nnarrative up to the moment immediately preceding the capture of\r\n203-Metre Hill--an event that marked the turning-point of the whole\r\nprotracted operations, and that proved to be the real beginning of the\r\nend. Before describing in detail the action that led to this signal\r\nvictory for General Nogi's troops, it may be well to give a brief\r\nrésumé of the situation as it then existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORT ARTHUR AND THE SURROUNDING FORTS.]\r\n\r\nThe investment may be said to have begun on June 26th, and between that\r\ndate and the end of October a series of more or less desperate and\r\ncostly assaults on the Russian outworks had carried the Japanese lines\r\ncloser and closer to the permanent defences with which the town and the\r\nharbor of Port Arthur were secured from attack by land. In the great\r\nattacks of August 28th and September 20th, some progress was made to\r\nthe east and north; but no great impression was made in the formidable\r\nchain of forts; and even on October 30th, when another assault was\r\ndelivered, on the Keekwan and Urlungshan forts, the Japanese were\r\nrepulsed with the loss of 2,000 men. On September 20th a determined\r\nassault had been made on 203-Metre Hill--the highest eminence of that\r\nridge which runs between Louisa Bay on the west and the great forts,\r\nItszshan and Antszshan, dominating the western approaches of Port\r\nArthur. The attempt was almost successful, but not quite, and all that\r\nremained to reward the Japanese for their terrible sacrifice of life\r\nwas the possession of a height, a little to the north, known as\r\nNamaokoyama, or 180-Metre Hill. This is due east of 174 Metre Hill,\r\ncaptured in August. At the same time the Japanese, however, succeeded\r\nin taking possession of the Sueishi lunettes, which defend the valley\r\nthrough which the railway runs, and of Fort Kuropatkin, which commands\r\nthe water supply of Port Arthur. This was the position when, on\r\nNovember 26th, General Nogi ordered another assault on the fortress,\r\nwith the especial object of capturing 203 Metre Hill. The possession of\r\nthis height was of immense importance to the besiegers--not because it\r\nwould threaten the great forts of Antszshan and Itszshan, but because\r\nit would afford a complete view of every corner of the harbor, and\r\nenable the fire of heavy guns to be directed on the last refuge of the\r\nRussian fleet. More than that, the position would command the branch\r\nline running from Port Arthur to Liau-tie-shan, whither the Russians\r\nwere daily conveying stores, as if in preparation for a last stand in\r\nthis inaccessible stronghold. Although not one of the permanent\r\nfortifications, the defences of 203 Metre Hill were of the most\r\nformidable kind. On the crest, and cut out of the hill itself, were two\r\nredoubts on the two distinct peaks, each mounting heavy guns, while the\r\nslopes leading up to them were traversed with trenches and wire\r\nentanglements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAULING GUNS UP A CAPTURED HILL AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Attack Metre Hill]\r\n\r\nAfter his repulse in September, General Nogi had abandoned all further\r\nattack on the west; but the importance of effecting a lodgment there,\r\ntogether with his equal lack of success in the east, induced him to\r\nreturn to his earlier plan. But this time the methods of attack were\r\nchanged. To prevent the concentration of the garrison at one point,\r\nassaults were delivered simultaneously on the two opposite sides of the\r\nperimeter of defence; and, instead of trusting to the mere weight of\r\nnumbers to overcome resistance, the resources of the military engineer\r\nwere drawn upon to facilitate approach to the critical points. At the\r\nlast assault the Japanese infantry had moved forward in close formation\r\nover the open ground separating their forming point from the trenches\r\nof the enemy, and they had been swept down in hundreds by the\r\nconcentrated fire from a dozen batteries. But early in November the\r\nJapanese engineers set to work to construct parallels from the low\r\nhills at the foot of the Metre range across the intervening valley and\r\nup the southwest corner of 203 Metre Hill, dominated by that one of the\r\ntwin peaks which was known as 210. To construct similar approaches on\r\nthe northeast side was rendered impossible by the fire of the\r\nneighboring fort Akasakayama. On November 27th fresh troops were\r\nbrought up for the attack, and a tremendous artillery fire was\r\nconcentrated on the summit of the Metre ridge. Field guns, firing\r\nshrapnel, and naval guns and howitzers, firing enormous shells, poured\r\ntheir deadly hail on the forts and trenches; but though they diminished\r\nthey could not utterly subdue the fire of the intrepid defenders, and\r\nthe Japanese casualties were very heavy as soon as their devoted\r\ninfantry, emerging from the parallels, endeavored to climb the steep\r\nface of the hill. But after nearly seven hours' fighting the crest was\r\nwon, and the southwestern peak fell into the hands of the Japanese.\r\nThis success was the signal for an immediate and determined assault\r\nupon the 203 peak, but it proved futile. A deadly fire from the\r\nneighboring forts made the retention of the southwest peak impossible\r\nfor the gallant men who had won it. They were driven down to the\r\nreverse slope again, and were thus unable to assist in keeping down the\r\nfire of the garrison of 203 peak. An attack on the Akasakayama works\r\nalso failed, and thus the troops assailing the northeastern face of the\r\nhill were exposed to a flank fire as well as to a direct fire from\r\nabove, and were driven back with heavy loss. But the Japanese managed\r\nto retain their position just below the crest of 210, and here they\r\nconstructed trenches which made the reoccupation of the summit by the\r\nenemy impossible. But the Russians still disputed possession, and the\r\nopposing forces, behind sandbag defences erected within a stone's throw\r\nof one another, maintained an incessant fight with bullets, bayonets\r\nand hand-grenades. The proximity of the combatants compelled the\r\nartillery on both sides to desist from taking part in the encounter.\r\nThe Japanese guns confined themselves to shelling the crest of 203 peak\r\nand the reverse slope of 210, in order to prevent reinforcements\r\nreaching the troops that still disputed the possession of that\r\neminence. At this moment occurred one of those tragic incidents which\r\nthrow such an ironic light on the best laid schemes of generals and the\r\nnoblest self-sacrifice of soldiers. A party of Japanese managed at last\r\nto establish themselves in a trench on the slope of Akasakayama; but no\r\nsooner had they attained this hard-won position than they found\r\nthemselves exposed to a merciless hail of shrapnel, not from Russian\r\nguns, but from those of their own countrymen. The Japanese artillerists\r\nhad not observed the lodgment that had been made in the enemy's\r\ntrenches, and they persisted in their bombardment with such deadly\r\neffect that their luckless comrades were compelled to relinquish the\r\nadvantage they had gained, and to make the best of their way back to\r\nthe main body under a double fire. On December 1st a renewed attack on\r\nboth the 210 and 203 peaks was made, but with no success; and during\r\nthe next few days the Japanese engineers were busy in extending their\r\nparallels and trenches, in order to allow the assailing troops to\r\napproach close to their objective before coming under fire; and while\r\nthis work was going on the Russian positions were subjected to a\r\nfurious and incessant bombardment. This bombardment reached its height\r\non the morning of the 5th, when every preparation for the renewed\r\nassault had been completed. The Metre Hill, it is said, resembled a\r\nsmoking volcano under the storm of shell that burst over it. This\r\nassault was to be a supreme effort, and every Japanese soldier who took\r\npart in it was conscious of the responsibility devolving on him, as,\r\nafter saluting the regimental standards, he moved forward to take his\r\nplace in the ranks that lined the parallels and advanced trenches.\r\nEarly in the afternoon a simultaneous rush was made towards both of the\r\ncrests of the Metre range. The moment was one of acute suspense, and\r\nwith breathless anxiety the Japanese staff watched the far-off line of\r\nkhaki-clad figures swarming up the hillside and climbing over the\r\nbreastwork of the Russian trenches. The issue was not long in doubt.\r\nMeeting with scarcely any resistance, the storming parties swept on\r\nuntil they reached the crest of both peaks, and found themselves at\r\nlast in undisputed possession of the long-coveted position. The\r\nexplanation of this unexpectedly easy victory was not far to seek. The\r\nbombardment of the previous three days had been so severe that it had\r\nbeen impossible for the defenders to live under it. The 500-lb. shells\r\nfrom the howitzers had blown the place to fragments, and except for\r\nthree men taken prisoners, every soul who manned the guns and trenches\r\nhad been killed or forced to fly to the forts in the rear. Torn and\r\nmutilated bodies, mingled with piles of débris, lay about in hundreds,\r\nand the scene was rendered the more appalling by the presence of\r\ncorpses, in every stage of decomposition, which had been lying on the\r\nground since the attack on September 20th. But the Japanese were not\r\nleft long in undisturbed possession of the ground they had won. General\r\nStoessel, realizing as fully as his enemy the importance of 203 Metre\r\nHill, made desperate efforts to recapture it. Six separate\r\ncounter-assaults were delivered, and for hours the fiercest and most\r\nsanguinary hand-to-hand fighting raged. But the Japanese had stronger\r\nreinforcements than their adversaries, and their numbers and gallantry\r\nprevailed at last. After losing nearly 3,000 men, the Russian General\r\nrealized that the case was hopeless, and left his enemy in possession\r\nof the stricken field. Immediately their position was assured the\r\nJapanese dragged up their guns and proceeded to pound the neighboring\r\nheight Akasakayama, from which the Russians were forced to retire with\r\nall speed. While this substantial and, as it turned out, decisive\r\nvictory was being won in the west, an equally determined assault was\r\nproceeding in the east against the great forts of Urlungshan,\r\nSungshushan and East Keekwanshan. The Japanese carried their parallels\r\nwithin charging distance of the front of the forts, and then began to\r\nmine. Having reached a point beneath the counterscarp, they exploded\r\ntheir mines, and then rushed into the breach thus formed. But the\r\nRussians, though losing heavily by the explosions, were prepared for\r\nthe emergency. They had machine guns placed in position to command the\r\nouter defences, and the assailants only gained the breach to be mown\r\ndown by a hail of bullets. In this assault the Japanese had recourse to\r\nthe traditional weapon of their ancient chivalry. Under the lead of\r\nGenerals Nakamura and Saito, trained bodies of swordsmen of the famous\r\nSamurai, or warrior-caste, charged into the imminent deadly breach,\r\nendeavoring to close in a desperate hand-to-hand encounter with their\r\nstubborn foe. But even the traditional gallantry of Japan's knighthood\r\nwas spent in vain in this enterprise, and the parapets of the forts\r\nremained inaccessible to assault. But the Japanese, whose resource in\r\nthis protracted siege had only been equalled by their indomitable\r\ndetermination, had by this time learned the secret of success against\r\nsuch tremendous fortifications as those with which Port Arthur was\r\nbegirt. Since gallantry and the sacrifice of life could not prevail,\r\npatience and ingenuity must be tried, and the engineers were called\r\nupon to carry further still the sapping operations which had already\r\nbreached the outer works. As in the adoption of those deadly\r\nhand-grenades, which played so important a part in all the battles of\r\nthe siege, so in the construction of parallels and the tunnelling of\r\nmines the world saw a return to the practice and methods of the 17th\r\ncentury. To find a counterpart to these huge forts of Port Arthur, with\r\ntheir scarps and counter-scarps, their glacis and cuponniéres and\r\nravelins, one has to go back to the system of the great military\r\nengineer Vanban, who carried the science of fortification to its\r\nhighest perfection. There was only one assailant to which these mighty\r\nworks were not impregnable--and that assailant was the explosive power\r\nof dynamite. This resistless auxiliary the Japanese made speed to\r\nenlist in their service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Fleet between Two Fires]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, leaving the sappers to their insidious task on the east, the\r\nJapanese artillerists were swift to take advantage of the new position\r\nwon for them on the west. From the summit of 203 Metre Hill, the whole\r\ntown and harbor of Port Arthur lay revealed, and the remnant of the\r\nRussian fleet which lay sheltered there could no longer escape the\r\nsearching attentions of the Japanese shells. The great howitzers,\r\nfiring their 500 lb. projectiles, and the big naval guns were quickly\r\nmoved into position, and, directed from the observation station on 203\r\nMetre Hill, they began to drop shot after shot on the helpless\r\nmen-of-war. So perfect was the command, that it was possible for the\r\nbesiegers to count every day the hits they made, and to specify the\r\nparticular ships against which they had been recorded. One after\r\nanother these mighty vessels succumbed to the incessant pounding that\r\nthey received, and in a few days the four battleships _Retvisan_,\r\n_Peresviet_, _Pobieda_ and _Poltava_, and the armored cruiser _Bayan_\r\nwere reported sunk or damaged so as to be unseaworthy. Only the\r\n_Sevastopol_ remained, and she temporarily escaped to the outer\r\nroadstead, with consequences that will be related presently. These\r\nships were the real objective of the siege. Their disablement preserved\r\nJapan from her most serious menace; but next to that consummation,\r\ntheir capture was a point of primary importance. The Japanese naturally\r\ndesired not only to render these powerful vessels useless to their\r\nadversaries, but to make them useful to themselves. Accordingly, having\r\nmade sure that the ships were injured beyond the power of the Port\r\nArthur docks to repair them, the besiegers were careful to inflict no\r\nfurther damage on them. By the 12th the Japanese gunners had attained\r\ntheir object, and the _Sevastopol_ was the only seaworthy survivor of\r\nthe Russian squadron; and attention was forthwith turned to her from\r\nanother direction. Admiral Togo, whose fleet had been cruising outside\r\nPort Arthur to shut off the natural avenue of escape for the wretched\r\nRussian fleet, now directed his torpedo-boats to attack the battleship\r\n_Sevastopol_ as she lay at her moorings in the outer roadstead. Her\r\nposition was exactly that which the whole Pacific squadron had occupied\r\non the fateful night of February 6th, when the first stroke of war was\r\ndelivered, and Russia's best two battleships were put out of action.\r\nBut this time the advantage of a surprise attack was out of the\r\nquestion. The commander of the _Sevastopol_ well knew what to expect,\r\nand had taken his precautions accordingly. An enormous boom had been\r\nconstructed round the hull of the warship, and an elaborate system of\r\nnetting had been hung from it to defy the approach of any torpedo. On\r\nthe other hand, however, the fire of the shore batteries was no longer\r\na substantial auxiliary in repelling torpedo attack; and the whole\r\norganization of the port defences was more or less impaired, if not\r\ndestroyed. On the night of the 12th of December, and thrice again on\r\nthe night of the 13th, the intrepid torpedo-craft of the Japanese fleet\r\nsteamed into the roadstead and fired their terrible engines of\r\ndestruction at the ill-fated battleship. But the boom proved on these\r\noccasions an impenetrable defence; so the attack was again\r\nrenewed--this time in a blinding snowstorm. Two flotillas were engaged.\r\nThe one lost its direction owing to the snow and the glare of the\r\nenemy's searchlights; but the second flotilla reached its mark, and\r\ndischarged torpedoes at the _Sevastopol_, on which at least two took\r\neffect. The boats became separated in the storm, and one never returned\r\nto the main fleet--being either sunk by a shot or swamped by the very\r\nhigh seas that were running. To add to the difficulty of the\r\nenterprise, the weather was bitterly cold, and the decks of the vessels\r\nwere coated with ice from the freezing of the spray that broke over\r\nthem. When morning broke, those who had been engaged in this desperate\r\nenterprise were rewarded by the sight of the _Sevastopol_ perceptibly\r\ndown at the stern. A few days later the vessel was so disabled that she\r\nhad to be run aground. The spirit in which this daring attack was\r\ncarried out may be gathered from the following extracts from Admiral\r\nTogo's official dispatches:--\r\n\r\n\"While retreating, one torpedo boat was struck several times. Her\r\ncommander, Lieutenant Nakahara, and five other men were killed. The\r\nboat lost her freedom of motion, and Lieutenant Nakahara's boat went to\r\nthe rescue. Notwithstanding a heavy fire, she continued her effort to\r\nsave the disabled vessel. When she had her in tow, the hawser was\r\nsevered by the enemy's shells, and Lieutenant Nakahara's boat was also\r\nhit, and one man killed. Subsequently several shells hit and almost\r\ndisabled Lieutenant Nakahara's boat, and forced him to abandon his\r\nsister ship, which was in a sinking condition. Lieutenant Nakahara,\r\nhowever, steamed back and rescued the crew, who were abandoning the\r\nboat. Commander Kawase's boat, of the same flotilla, was struck by a\r\nshell, which killed one man and wounded Lieutenant Takahashi and two\r\nsailors. Lieutenant Shoro's boat was also hit, one man being killed and\r\nfive wounded. The boat was temporarily disabled, but the ships\r\ncommanded by Lieutenants Wataehe and Mori stood by her and rescued all\r\nthe men. The other vessels, bravely facing the enemy's fire, succeeded\r\nin delivering their attacks without sustaining damage.... It is a\r\nsource of satisfaction that our torpedo attacks were delivered without\r\nthe least confusion; each boat rendered material assistance to her\r\ncomrades. The skill in manoeuvring and the bravery displayed by our\r\nofficers and men inspire me with a deep feeling of satisfaction and\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Japanese Hero]\r\n\r\nCommander Yezoe's flotilla was under repairs when the attack was\r\nplanned. He succeeded in putting one of his torpedo-boats into fighting\r\ncondition, and steamed to the rendezvous, where he found that the other\r\nflotillas had already left. His entreaty that he should be permitted to\r\njoin in the attack was granted, and steaming alone through the blinding\r\nsnow, he succeeded in locating the _Sevastopol_. Approaching close\r\nenough to hear the Russians talking, he fired a torpedo, and then,\r\ngoing in still closer, he discharged another torpedo at the battleship.\r\nA shell from the _Sevastopol_ struck Commander Yezoe in the abdomen,\r\nand cut his body in two. His remains were saved and brought back to the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tunnels and Hand Grenades]\r\n\r\nThe complete destruction or disablement of the remnant of the Russian\r\nfleet seems to have had a dispiriting effect, as well it might have, on\r\nthe defenders of Port Arthur, for from this moment the vigor of their\r\nresistance to assault perceptibly waned. In proportion the confidence\r\nand resolution of the Japanese increased, and before long their\r\nunremitting exertions were rewarded with another substantial success.\r\nHitherto their assaults on the eastern defences of Port Arthur had met\r\nwith but little success. In spite of all their sacrifices the great\r\npermanent forts stood firm; but by the middle of December their new\r\nmethods of sapping and mining achieved the long-desired breach in the\r\niron ring, and East Keekwanshan fort was captured. A mine had been\r\ntunnelled right up to the parapet of the fort, and in the afternoon of\r\nDecember 18th the mine was exploded, bringing down an avalanche of\r\nearth and masonry that filled up the ditch in its fall, and made a rude\r\nbut practicable staircase up the deep counter-scarp into the interior\r\nof the fort. The Japanese troops, lying ready in their trenches, sprang\r\nforward to the breach before the garrison could recover from the\r\ndiscomfiture of the explosion, and poured into the inner works,\r\nflinging their terrible hand-grenades at all who opposed their\r\nimpetuous charge. But after the first surprise, the Russians recovered\r\nand stood their ground, and by turning machine guns on the assailants,\r\nheld them for a time at bay. While the issue still hung in the balance,\r\nhowever, General Samejuna, at the head of the Japanese reserves, flung\r\nhimself into the fighting line, and a last great charge swept the fort\r\nclear of its dogged defenders. The fight lasted for no less than ten\r\nhours, and immediately it was won the Japanese entrenched themselves to\r\nmake their hold secure. The attack, in this case, was entrusted to two\r\nbodies of volunteers, who, in calm anticipation of their probable fate,\r\nhad fastened to their clothing badges of identification, so that the\r\ncorpses should be recognizable in spite of the disfiguring effects of\r\nthe explosion of hand-grenades. One-half of these devoted men charged\r\nfrom their trenches too eagerly after the mine had been fired, with the\r\nresult that most of them were buried beneath the falling debris. The\r\nnature and extent of the mining operations which made the capture of\r\nEast Keekwanshan practicable may be gathered from the fact that two\r\ntunnels 40 feet long had been dug out, and that both tunnels terminated\r\nin four branches, in each of which a separate mine was laid. Four\r\nquick-firers, five field guns, and four machine guns, and a large\r\nquantity of rifles and ammunition, were among the spoils that fell to\r\nthe victors in this assault. Only twenty men of the garrison escaped\r\ndown a covered way, which they blocked behind them by the explosion of\r\nmines. The fort captured, though not one of the strongest of those on\r\nthe eastern ridge, was yet of great importance to the besiegers,\r\nbecause it opened the way to the greater forts beyond, and this success\r\nwas speedily followed by others on the other side of Port Arthur.\r\nOperating between Pigeon Bay and the Metre range, the Japanese captured\r\nseveral minor heights on which the Russians had mounted guns. Thus they\r\ncontinued to advance steadily to the isolation of the western defences;\r\nand the only comfort which the anxious authorities in St. Petersburg\r\ncould enjoy was that to be derived from a dispatch of General\r\nKuropatkin, in which the Commander-in-Chief in Manchuria announced\r\nthat, according to Chinese reports, the garrison of Port Arthur had\r\nrecaptured 203 Metre Hill, \"with the guns placed there by the enemy.\"\r\nThe Chinese do nothing by halves, not even lying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE ELEVEN-INCH MORTAR BEFORE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Capture Urlungshan]\r\n\r\nUndismayed by this announcement, the Japanese continued their\r\ninvestment with increasing severity, and on December 28th, or four\r\nweeks after the capture of 203 Metre Hill, they achieved the great\r\ntriumph of wresting the mighty Urlungshan from its stubborn defenders.\r\nThis, the greatest and most formidable of all the eastern forts of Port\r\nArthur had defied many previous assaults, and had cost the army of the\r\nMikado many hundreds of gallant lives. But like the northern fort of\r\nEast Keekwanshan, it succumbed to the irresistible persuasion of\r\ndynamite. At 10 o'clock in the morning of December 28th, the mine which\r\nhad been laid beneath the parapet was exploded, and the Japanese rushed\r\nin through the breach. Under the cover of artillery fire from the rear,\r\nthe assaulters then constructed defensive works; and having thus\r\nestablished themselves and received reinforcements, they rushed forward\r\nagain and captured the heavy guns of the fort. From this point another\r\ncharge had to be made before the defenders could be driven out\r\ncompletely; but by half-past seven in the evening the task was\r\naccomplished, and the whole fort was in the hands of the Japanese,\r\nwhose losses amounted to at least 1,000 men. The spoils included four\r\nbig guns, seven smaller guns, thirty quick-firers, and two machine\r\nguns. The tunnels for the mines which were exploded under the parapet\r\nhad to be cut through the solid rock, and no less than two tons of\r\ndynamite was used for the exploding charge. The result was that half\r\nthe garrison of 500 men were killed on the spot. Next to the great\r\nUrlung fort, Sungshushan was the most formidable permanent work on the\r\neastern ridge, and three days later this fell to the Japanese in much\r\nthe same way. On the morning of the last day of the expiring year,\r\ndynamite mines were exploded beneath the parparet of the fort, and\r\nwithin an hour the whole fort was in the secure possession of the\r\nJapanese. Over 300 of the defenders were entombed in one of the\r\ngalleries by the explosion, and of these only a half were rescued by\r\nthe victors, the remainder perishing miserably. Other forts in the\r\nimmediate vicinity fell almost immediately afterwards, and it became\r\nevident that the whole of the forts on the eastern ridge were\r\npractically doomed. Nothing now could stay the victorious onslaught of\r\nthe Japanese, and the capitulation of Port Arthur, which but a little\r\nwhile before had seemed so remote and conjectural, now loomed in the\r\nimmediate future. But even yet the world was hardly prepared for the\r\nend which was imminent. Up to the last, General Stoessel's dispatches\r\nhad been confident and defiant, and it was thought to be quite likely\r\nthat even yet he would reveal some hitherto unsuspected resources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Surrender of Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nIn his somewhat rhetorical dispatches to the Czar, General Stoessel had\r\nrepeatedly declared his determination to fight to the death, and\r\nalthough the signal successes of the Japanese during the month of\r\nDecember had evidently reduced very largely the resisting power of the\r\ngarrison, the general expectation was that the hopeless struggle would\r\nstill be carried on, and that Stoessel and his troops would in the last\r\nresort retire to the fastnesses of Liau-tie-shan. While deprecating\r\nthis desperate counsel, as involving the useless shedding of blood, the\r\nworld would have applauded its heroism. But as it happened, other\r\ncounsels prevailed. On the morning of the first day of the new year\r\nGeneral Nogi received a letter from General Stoessel proposing\r\nnegotiations for capitulation, and the proposal was immediately\r\naccepted. But operations were not at once suspended. The Japanese\r\nattacked the same morning the Fort of Wantai on the East Ridge, and\r\ncaptured it after only slight resistance, while several of the forts in\r\nthe vicinity were blown up by the defenders. In further recognition of\r\nthe fact that all was lost save honor, the Russians then proceeded to\r\nexplode mines on all the warships in the harbor, in order to ensure\r\nthat they should be useless to the enemy into whose hands they were\r\nabout to fall. Of the destroyer flotilla, only four vessels remained\r\nserviceable. These put to sea on the night of January 1st, and,\r\nmanaging to evade the blockading squadron, reached Chifu, where they\r\nwere immediately dismantled. Then at last a truce was proclaimed, and\r\nfor the first time for six long months the thunder of the great guns\r\nrolled no longer about Port Arthur. Immediately news of the proposed\r\nsurrender was received in St. Petersburg, the Mikado magnanimously\r\nexpressed his high appreciation of the loyalty and endurance displayed\r\nby General Stoessel on behalf of his country, and gave orders that all\r\nthe honors of war should be extended to him.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd the capitulation agreement was signed, its essential\r\nterms being as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe whole fortress, ships, arms, ammunition, military buildings,\r\nmaterials and other Government property were to be surrendered. The\r\nJapanese reserved free action if those objects were considered to have\r\nbeen destroyed or injured after the signing of the agreement. Plans of\r\nforts, torpedoes, mines, military and naval officers' lists, &c. were\r\nto be delivered over. Soldiers, sailors, volunteers and other officials\r\nwere to be taken prisoners, but, in consideration of the brave defences\r\nthey had made, military and naval officers and civil officials attached\r\nwere to be allowed to bear arms, keep their private property of\r\nimmediate necessity of daily life, and also to return to Russia upon\r\nparole not to take, till the end of the war, arms or action opposed to\r\nJapan's interest. Forts Itszshan, Antszshan and the others outstanding\r\nwere to be surrendered to the Japanese before noon, January 3rd, as a\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Great Sovereign! Forgive!\"]\r\n\r\nThe whole world was filled with sympathy and admiration for the gallant\r\nsoldiers whose valor and endurance had withstood so long such heavy\r\nodds and such a fearful strain. These feelings were intensified by the\r\nlurid accounts which, now that concealment could no longer be of\r\nservice, were published of the awful sufferings of the garrison during\r\nthe later stages of the siege. An officer of one of the destroyers that\r\nescaped to Chifu on January 1st thus described the conditions which had\r\ncompelled surrender:--\r\n\r\n\"Port Arthur falls of exhaustion--exhaustion not only of ammunition but\r\nalso of men. The remnant left was doing heroes' work for five days and\r\nfive nights, and yesterday it had reached the limit of human endurance.\r\nIn the casemates of the forts one saw everywhere faces black with\r\nstarvation, exhaustion and nerve strain. You spoke to them and they did\r\nnot answer, but stared dumbly in front of them. Lack of ammunition\r\nalone would not have prompted any attempt to arrange terms. Lack of\r\nammunition has been common in the fortress during the past months. Many\r\nforts had nothing with which to return the fire of the enemy. The\r\nRussians sat in the casemates firing no more than one shot to the\r\nJapanese 200. Then, when the assault came, they repulsed the enemy with\r\nthe bayonet. But the men themselves, feeding for three months on\r\nreduced rations, were so worn that it is marvelous that they stood the\r\nfinal strain so long.\"\r\n\r\nIn his last dispatches, written just before the capitulation, General\r\nStoessel himself said:--\r\n\r\n\"The position of the fortress is becoming very painful. Our principal\r\nenemies are scurvy, which is mowing down the men, and 11-inch shells,\r\nwhich know no obstacle and against which there is no protection. There\r\nonly remains a few persons who have not been attacked by scurvy. We\r\nhave taken all possible measures, but the disease is spreading. The\r\npassive endurance of the enemy's bombardment with 11-inch shells, the\r\nimpossibility of reply for want of ammunition, the outbreak of scurvy,\r\nand the loss of a mass of officers--all these causes diminish daily the\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\"The tale of losses of higher officers is an indication of the enormous\r\nlosses which we have sustained. Of ten generals, two, Kondrachenko and\r\nTserpitsky, have been killed; one, Raznatovsky, is dead; two are\r\nwounded, myself and General Nadeine; and one Gorbatovsky, is suffering\r\nfrom contusions. The percentage of other superior officers who were\r\nkilled or died of disease or were wounded several times is enormous.\r\nMany companies are commanded by ensigns, and on an average each company\r\nis at present composed of not more than sixty men.\"\r\n\r\nIt was stated that of the original garrison of 35,000 men, no less than\r\n11,000 had been killed, while 16,000 were sick or wounded, and 8,000\r\nremained in the forts, of whom, however, 2,000 were unable to fight.\r\n\r\nThese are the words in which General Stoessel announced to the Czar the\r\nsurrender of Russia's \"impregnable stronghold\":--\r\n\r\n\"Great Sovereign! Forgive! We have done all that was humanly possible.\r\nJudge us, but be merciful. Eleven months of ceaseless fighting have\r\nexhausted our strength. A quarter only of the defenders, and one-half\r\nof these invalids, occupy twenty-seven versts of fortifications without\r\nsupport and without intervals for even the briefest repose. The men are\r\nreduced to shadows.\"\r\n\r\nEven the Japanese were at first impressed with the same view of the\r\nsituation, for they reported that of 25,000 combatants, 20,000 were\r\nsick or wounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Occupy the Fortress]\r\n\r\nThe greatest good feeling prevailed between the two armies after the\r\nsurrender had been completed. The soldiers fraternized freely, and the\r\nJapanese did all in their power to deprive the situation of all trace\r\nof humiliation for their vanquished enemy. General Stoessel and General\r\nNogi lunched together and exchanged fraternal compliments, but the\r\nbearing of the two men was strongly contrasted. There was a note of\r\ntheatricality in the Russian's conduct which was significant. Having\r\nmounted his favorite charger and shown its paces to the Japanese\r\nvictor, he begged to be allowed to present it to him--a proposal which\r\nGeneral Nogi put by with the matter-of-fact observation that the horse\r\nalready belonged to the Japanese Army, and that he could not accept it\r\nas a personal gift. But still all the world rang with praises of the\r\nheroic Russian garrison; and the German Emperor, with characteristic\r\nimpetuosity, constituted himself a sort of supreme umpire, and with a\r\ngreat flourish of trumpets presented to the leaders of the two\r\ncontesting forces in this historic siege the Prussian Order, \"Pour le\r\nMerite.\" The Russians marched out of Port Arthur on the 7th of January,\r\nand the Japanese entered on the following day; and then the reports as\r\nto the condition of Port Arthur suddenly underwent a remarkable change.\r\nIt slowly leaked out that the surrendered force amounted not to 20,000,\r\nmost of whom were _hors de combat_ from wounds or disease, but to\r\n48,000, of whom 878 officers and 32,000 men were still available for\r\nthe defence of the fortress. There were also discovered no less than\r\n80,000 tons of coal and enough rice and flour to provision the garrison\r\nfor two months. The troops, moreover, discovered no sign of starvation\r\nor exhaustion. They were found to be in splendid condition and well\r\nfed. Even the ammunition was very far from being exhausted. For the\r\nguns in the forts 82,670 rounds remained; 30,000 kilogrammes of powder;\r\nand 2,266,800 cartridges for rifles. \"There are no signs of privation,\"\r\nwrote one correspondent. \"The surrender is inexplicable.\" The town\r\nitself showed few signs of bombardment; and the only serious deficiency\r\nin stores was in meat and medical comforts. Then the sinister report\r\ncame that the real weakness of the garrison was in the conduct of many\r\nof the regimental officers, who habitually applied for leave when\r\nattacks were expected, and left the command to sergeants. It was also\r\ndeclared that General Stoessel, far from having been coerced by his\r\nstaff into surrender, had himself overridden their protests against\r\ncapitulation. The real hero of the siege, it appeared from the same\r\naccount, was not General Stoessel at all, but General Kondrachenko, who\r\nwas killed by a shell on December 18th. After that calamity the spirits\r\nof the garrison never recovered. One of the Russian Admirals who was\r\nmade prisoner at Port Arthur is responsible for this version of the\r\nfacts, and his view was summarized in the following words: \"It is\r\ndifficult for a Russian officer to talk about the end. It was worse\r\nthan a mistake, it was a disgrace. The fortress could easily have held\r\nout another month. We had food and ammunition sufficient for that\r\nperiod, and if Kondrachenko had been alive we should have held out for\r\nmonths longer. In Kondrachenko the garrison lost not only a leader, but\r\nthe one man who had the power, through his tremendous earnestness, to\r\ncontrol General Stoessel.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discreditable Surrender]\r\n\r\nThis view, startling and disconcerting as it is, was strongly confirmed\r\nby Dr. Morrison, the famous Peking correspondent of the London _Times_,\r\nto whom special facilities for inspecting Port Arthur were afforded\r\nimmediately after the surrender had taken place. He was immensely\r\nimpressed with the stupendous strength of the positions held by the\r\nRussians, and of the incredible heroism displayed in their capture, but\r\nhe could find no explanation for the surrender. There were, he said,\r\n25,000 able-bodied soldiers, and several hundred officers unscathed by\r\nwound or disease. Only 200 officers were killed all through the siege,\r\nand of those found in hospital a number were undoubted malingerers. As\r\nto the failure of ammunition, Dr. Morrison pointed out that thousands\r\nof rounds were fired off aimlessly for two days before the surrender,\r\nthat thousands more were thrown into the harbor, and that yet a large\r\nquantity was found in store by the Japanese. The largest of the naval\r\nmagazines was discovered \"full to the roof\" with all kinds of\r\nammunition. Food was plentiful and the new town was uninjured by\r\nbombardment.\r\n\r\n\"Those who have witnessed the condition of the fortress,\" Dr. Morrison\r\nsummed up, \"contrasting the evidence of their eyes with the astounding\r\nmisrepresentations of General Stoessel, had their sympathy turned into\r\nderision, believing that no more discreditable surrender has been\r\nrecorded in history.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EVACUATION OF PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The End of the Siege of Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nIf it is difficult to disbelieve statements of this kind coming from\r\nseveral independent and well-accredited sources, it is painful to have\r\nto accept them. But whatever record leap to light, nothing can detract\r\nfrom the splendid gallantry and dogged tenacity of the Russian common\r\nsoldiers who fought in a manner worthy of the greatest traditions of\r\ntheir race. Thanks to their qualities, such a redoubtable foe as the\r\nJapanese had been held at bay for six months, and his victory had only\r\nbeen obtained at a cost of life truly appalling. Officially the\r\ncasualties of the besieging army were put at 55,000 from first to last;\r\nbut this number was probably very largely exceeded. Heavy as was the\r\nprice that had been paid, however, it was not too heavy for the\r\nadvantage obtained. First there was the satisfaction to the national\r\nsentiment of pride in recapturing the fortress which, after having once\r\nbeen won by force of arms, had been filched away by diplomatic\r\nintrigue. Next there was the wresting from the enemy of the emblem of\r\nhis dominion in the Far East, and the only base on which his naval\r\npower could rest. The loss of Port Arthur was to Russia not only the\r\nloss of a great fortress but the denial of all access to the sea.\r\nFinally, and most immediately important, was the capture in a more or\r\nless battered condition, of five battleships and two first-class\r\ncruisers, which might at any time have helped to turn the balance of\r\nnaval power against Japan. An examination of the derelict warships\r\nrevealed the fact that in spite of all the hammering they had received,\r\nfour might possibly be repaired and added to the navy of Japan. The\r\n_Sevastopol_, the _Retvisan_, and the _Pobieda_ were injured beyond\r\nhope; but the _Peresviet_, the _Poltava_, the _Pallada_ and the _Bayan_\r\nwere possibly recoverable. So ended one of the most memorable sieges in\r\nthe history of the world--to prove that, in spite of all the inventions\r\nof scientific warfare, no defences that can be constructed by man are\r\nimpregnable to man when he unites, like the Japanese soldier, the\r\nqualities of fearlessness, discipline, patriotism and high-training.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER TWELVE MONTHS.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Sha-Ho, October 10 to 18, began by a Russian advance,\r\nbut ended in a victory for Japan. The rival armies then settled down\r\ninto winter quarters, and, save for an occasional skirmish, remained\r\nquiet until the end of January, when the Russians made a futile attempt\r\nto turn the Japanese left at Sandepu. The siege of Port Arthur,\r\nmeantime, was carried on vigorously. High Hill (203 Metre Hill) was\r\ncaptured on November 30, East Keekwan Fort on December 18, and\r\nErlungshan ten days later. On the last day of the year Sungshushan was\r\ntaken, and on January 1 the fortress surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portion shows the Japanese advance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  End of First Year--Changes of a Year--Year of Disaster for\r\n    Russia--The Cause of the War--Japan Acts Swiftly--The Land\r\n    Campaign--Battle of Liao-yang--Battle of Sha-ho River--The\r\n    Naval Campaign--Vladivostock Ships Defeated--Siege of Port\r\n    Arthur--Port Arthur Surrendered--A Campaign Analysis--Gaining\r\n    Mastery of Sea--Japan's Main Ambition--The Rival Armies--The\r\n    Cost in Men--The Cost in Dollars--The Cost in\r\n    Ships--International Incidents--Lessons of the War--Chronology\r\n    of the First Year of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of First Year]\r\n\r\nAt this point it may be well to pause long enough to review briefly and\r\nsummarize what had been accomplished in a year of the most tremendous\r\nfighting the world has ever known. One year of the Japan-Russia War had\r\ngone into history. On February 5, 1904, diplomatic relations between\r\nthe two nations came suddenly to an end. On February 7, Japan seized\r\nMasanpho, Korea, as a military base, and on February 8 and 9 were\r\ndelivered Togo's memorable blows to the Russian Asiatic fleet at Port\r\nArthur. Thus the curtain went up on what since has proved one of the\r\nworld's greatest war dramas.\r\n\r\nThe record had been one of uninterrupted triumph for Japan. The year\r\nhad yielded a score of battles, of greater or less importance. The\r\nstory of each had been defeat for Russia. Judged by the objects for\r\nwhich Japan entered the struggle, her task was practically complete.\r\nBut Russia, humbled again and again, remained obdurate. The war was not\r\nended and could not be ended, declared those who seemed to speak with\r\nauthority, until the tide had turned and Russia was mistress of the\r\nEast, as she believed herself a year before.\r\n\r\nWhat changes had followed Japan's victories, Russia's defeats?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes of a Year]\r\n\r\nA year before Russia in addition to her own vast Siberian territory\r\nacross all of Asia to the Pacific, was lessee of Port Arthur and the\r\nextremity of the Liaotung promontory. Port Arthur had been rebuilt and\r\nfortified, and the investments plus the value of the fleet in its\r\nharbor was fully $270,000,000. Dalny had been built and fortified as an\r\nauxiliary harbor to accommodate developing commerce. Here $100,000,000\r\nhad been expended. From these vantage points Russia looked out over\r\nChina and Japan and claimed dominance over the Orient. Her fleet stood\r\nsponsor for the claim. For the defenses of Port Arthur impregnability\r\nwas claimed. It seemed that the Slav had completed a peaceable conquest\r\nand was immovably intrenched, invulnerable against war, irresistible\r\nfor commercial gain.\r\n\r\nFurther eastward her agents had penetrated to the northern boundaries\r\nof Korea. Slowly the Slav with his land-thirst was learning to covet\r\nthe Hermit Kingdom. Commercial domination, political preponderance,\r\neach spreading in force and effectiveness, marked the first steps in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Year of Disaster for Russia]\r\n\r\nThis was a year before. A year later Japan's flag was flying over Port\r\nArthur and Dalny. Russia's fleet was destroyed. Her armies had been\r\ndriven step by step northward 250 miles to the Sha-ho River. Japan was\r\nmaster in Korea. A protectorate had been firmly established, and\r\nRussia's dream of predominance there had probably been dissipated for\r\nall time. Japan's fleet was supreme in the Orient. With Russia's\r\ncovetous eyes no longer looking out from Golden Hill toward Pekin,\r\ntoward Seoul, toward Tokio, Japan had come into her own again.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation as the first year of the war drew to a close.\r\nJapan's task, on the face of it, seemed accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cause of the War]\r\n\r\nRussia's aggressive policy in Manchuria and growing prestige in Korea\r\nalarmed Japan. Events which in February, 1904, culminated in war began\r\nten years before when Port Arthur, won by Japan from China, was wrested\r\naway and returned to China by intervention of the Powers, notably\r\nRussia. The leasing of Port Arthur and vicinity to Russia and the\r\ngranting of railroad concessions completed the wrong which rankled in\r\nthe heart of Japan. Finally the Mikado's Government proposed to Russia\r\na settlement by diplomacy of questions of paramountcy and trade\r\nprivileges in Manchuria and Korea. Japan proffered recognition of\r\nparamountcy in Manchuria for Russia in return for preponderance by\r\nJapan in Korea. The \"open door\" in each territory was proposed with\r\nright of railroad extension through Korea to join the Manchurian and\r\nthence the Siberian roads.\r\n\r\nRussia refused to discuss her attitude in Manchuria and juggled with\r\nwords relating to Korea. Negotiations ended when it became obvious that\r\nJapan's demands were not to be granted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan Acts Swiftly]\r\n\r\nWar was the alternative, and Japan acted swiftly. On February 8 and 9,\r\nat Port Arthur and Chemulpo, the Japanese navy dealt the first blows.\r\nKorea was invaded by an army at once, and the march to the Yalu was\r\nbegun. Manchuria was invaded after the victory at the Yalu of May 1. A\r\ndual campaign from that moment was developed. The supreme object was\r\nthe capture of Port Arthur. To facilitate that task the Russian armies\r\nin Manchuria were prevented from marching to the relief of the garrison\r\nthere. Blow after blow was administered by the Japanese armies,\r\nculminating in the great battles of Liaoyang and the Sha-ho River, each\r\na disastrous defeat for the Russians, each to be numbered among the\r\ngreatest military struggles of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Land Campaign]\r\n\r\nChronologically, the battle succeeding that of the Yalu, May 1, was\r\nfought at Pitsewo, May 5. Here the second Japanese army defeated the\r\nonly Russian force opposing an advance on Port Arthur, until at Nanshan\r\nHill and Kinchow, May 26-27, the garrison of the fortress was\r\nencountered in its outermost position. After the defeat at Nanshan Hill\r\nthe Russians withdrew to the outer perimeter of Port Arthur, giving up\r\nDalny without a struggle. At Vafangow, June 14-15, the Russian General\r\nStackelberg, who had been sent southward by General Kuropatkin to raise\r\nthe siege at Port Arthur, was defeated. His retreat northward amounted\r\npractically to a rout. The Japanese victory, as succeeding events\r\nproved, completely isolated Port Arthur, its defenders and the\r\nbesiegers, and the great drama of the siege went on without even an\r\nattempt at interference on the part of Russia's Manchurian army.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese fought a brilliant campaign of a score of battles between\r\nJune 17 and July 31, which compelled the concentration of the Russians\r\nat Liaoyang, and precipitated the great battle there. Motien Pass was\r\ntaken by General Kukori on June 17.\r\n\r\nOn June 30-31, after a tremendous struggle in the mountainous region\r\nsoutheast from Liaoyang, Yangze Pass, likewise, was captured. The\r\nJapanese armies, through these defiles poured into the vast basin\r\ndrained by the Liao River, and at Haicheng dealt Kuropatkin a severe\r\nblow, which drove his lines northward to Liaoyang and compelled the\r\nevacuation of Niuchwang.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Liaoyang]\r\n\r\nHaichang was a prelude to Liaoyang. After fierce fighting, the actual\r\nstruggle before this strongly fortified position began on August 25.\r\nThe Japanese army numbered 200,000 men against a probable 165,000\r\nRussians. Generals Oku and Nodzu delivered fierce and incessant frontal\r\nattacks from the south, while General Kuroki made a wide turning\r\nmovement north to encircle Kuropatkin and to cut off his retreat to\r\nMukden. The Russian General ultimately was compelled to meet this\r\nturning movement by withdrawing his entire army across the Taitse\r\nRiver, abandoning Liaoyang to the Japanese. General Kuroki was checked\r\nand the Russian army was extricated from a grave predicament in a\r\nmasterly manner after a memorable retreat and rearguard battle of more\r\nthan fifty miles. The battle had been designed as a crushing blow to\r\nthe Russians, and would have proved such had Kuroki's turning movement\r\nbeen completely successful. As it turned out the Japanese had won a\r\ncostly but indecisive victory. The Japanese losses are estimated at\r\n30,000 men. The Russian losses were about 20,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Sha-ho River]\r\n\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin fell back to Mukden and there rested and reinforced\r\nhis army. On October 4, he began a forward movement against the\r\nJapanese, which resulted in a new disaster to his army, the battle of\r\nSha-ho River, October 8-18. The result of this long, sanguinary\r\nstruggle was again highly indecisive. The Russian advance was checked\r\nat the Yentai mines, and thereafter Kuropatkin was forced step by step\r\nto the Sha-ho River. After ten days of battle human endurance reached\r\nits limit. Almost face to face, the exhausted armies halted.\r\nSubsequently the opposing lines stretched out along a line, generally\r\nnortheast-southwest, for a distance of forty-five miles. The Russian\r\narmy was reinforced to about 250,000 men, while the Japanese army\r\nnumbered perhaps 300,000 men with reinforcements from Japan and from\r\nPort Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Naval Campaign]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the war found the effective ships of Russia's Asiatic\r\nfleet divided among Port Arthur, Vladivostock and Chemulpo. In the\r\nbattle of Chemulpo, February 8-9, the _Variag_ and _Korietz_ were sunk,\r\nnarrowing naval interest to Port Arthur and Vladivostock. On August 10\r\nwas fought the greatest naval battle of the war. The Russian fleet off\r\nPort Arthur was defeated and dispersed, and Vice-Admiral Witoft was\r\nkilled on the bridge of the _Czarevitch_. The fragment of the fleet\r\nwhich returned to Port Arthur never again assumed the aggressive, while\r\nfrom that date until the surrender of the fortress Togo's squadron had\r\nonly blockade duty.\r\n\r\nOther naval operations there consisted of desperate dashes to the\r\nharbor entrance by Japan's smaller craft and the sinking of merchant\r\nships in the entrance to the harbor. A sortie by Admiral Makaroff\r\nresulted only in the flight of the Russians to port without giving\r\nbattle. The disaster to the _Petropavlovsk_ happened just as the flag\r\nship sped under the guns of Tiger's Tail and Golden Hill. Japanese\r\ncredited the destruction of the ship to their mine-laying operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSSACKS IN RETREAT AFTER A RECONNAISSANCE NEAR\r\nLIAO-YANG.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vladivostock Ships Defeated]\r\n\r\nThe Vladivostock squadron was defeated August 14 in the Sea of Japan.\r\nThe cruiser _Rurik_ was sunk. The two other ships of the squadron\r\nultimately reached Vladivostock riddled with shells. Repairs were said\r\nto have been completed. A renewal of the naval campaign would probably\r\ninvolve an attack on the sole survivors of the Russian fleet. A final\r\nnaval engagement was the sinking of the cruiser _Novik_, of the Port\r\nArthur Squadron, which escaped after the battle of August 10. Cruisers\r\nof Kamimura's squadron overtook her off Kamchatka, and the ship was\r\nbeached there, a complete wreck after a fourteen hours' battle. The\r\nlast act of the naval campaign was the destruction of the Russian\r\nbattleship _Sevastopol_ outside the harbor of Port Arthur. The\r\n_Sevastopol_ took refuge under the Tiger's Tail. Repeated dashes were\r\nmade by Japanese torpedo boat flotillas and the ship was riddled. Her\r\nfinal destruction, however, was accomplished by the Russians, who mined\r\nthe ship to prevent possibility of salvage on the fall of Port Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nJapan's greatest and only decisive achievement had been the taking of\r\nPort Arthur. The investment and actual opening of the siege began May\r\n30, when the Japanese occupied Dalny, with their lines spreading\r\nwestward to Louisa Bay, completely across the Liao-tung Peninsula.\r\nBetween May 30 and November 30 the Japanese were engaged in taking\r\nposition from which the attack on the main defenses of the fortress\r\ncould be directed. It was tedious work. Probably between 30,000 and\r\n40,000 Japanese lives were sacrificed. In the meantime Fort Kuropatkin,\r\nan outer defense north of the Urlung Mountain group of forts, had been\r\ncaptured, while on the west the Japanese, after tremendous efforts, had\r\nstormed and taken 203-Metre Hill. The final assault was delivered from\r\nsaps which had been driven through limestone, up the steep slopes of\r\nthe hill, a task of enormous difficulty which compelled the victors to\r\nshare laurels with the engineers who at prodigious cost in men and\r\nlabor made the assault possible. The capture of 203-Meter Hill gave the\r\nJapanese an observatory which looked down on most of Port Arthur. Their\r\nartillery, largely 11-inch howitzers, no longer fired at random.\r\nSighting was scientifically directed from the vantage point. Within a\r\nweek the entire Russian fleet had been destroyed and the whole city lay\r\nat the mercy of the irresistible 11-inch shells flung over the\r\nmountains with unerring aim.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Kuropatkin on the north the miner and sapper honeycombed the\r\nmountain sides with zig-zag trenches, which inched toward the crests,\r\nslowly, indeed, but surely. Outer works, one after the other, fell, and\r\nhigher and higher the Japanese lines crept upward toward the\r\nfort-crowned summits. The climax came December 30. Vast mines under the\r\nmain Urlungshan fort were fired. Before the smoke cleared the Japanese\r\nwere flinging themselves over the shattered walls. In one grand climax\r\nto all the bloody work of the siege they annihilated the defenders of\r\nthe fort and finally flung their flag from its battlements. With\r\nUrlungshan on the north and 203-Metre Hill on the west in their hands,\r\nPort Arthur lay completely at the mercy of the besiegers. The entire\r\nnortheastern groups of forts fell in a day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port Arthur Surrendered]\r\n\r\nThen came the end. On January 2, General Stoessel surrendered Port\r\nArthur to General Nogi. The city, forts and fleet, represented a value\r\nof $270,000,000. The cost of the siege to Japan was $100,000,000. More\r\nthan 30,000 men were killed, while 70,000 who fell, wounded, increased\r\nJapan's casualties to 100,000 men. Russia's original garrison of 38,000\r\nmen was cut down during the eight months by 11,500 killed and 17,500\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the surrender were deemed liberal. All officers were\r\noffered freedom in return for their parole. Others were taken to Japan\r\nas prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Campaign Analysis]\r\n\r\nFollowing the movements of the Japanese armies and fleets, it was easy\r\nto recognize the objects in view from the start, and to see that the\r\ncampaign had been conducted with singular fidelity to the plan adopted\r\nat the beginning. The results were quite as complete as could\r\nreasonably have been looked for. There can be no doubt that a year\r\nbefore Russia had no serious thought of war; her policy was clearly one\r\nof bluff and diplomatic evasion and delay. With great foresight the\r\nJapanese Government had seen that war was inevitable and the sooner it\r\ncame the better would be the position of Japan in the struggle for\r\nsupremacy in the East. Her preparations had been made as carefully and\r\ncompletely as those of Bismarck when he chose his time to force war\r\nupon Louis Napoleon; and she moved with even greater celerity and skill\r\nthan the Germans showed in the attack upon France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gaining Mastery of Sea]\r\n\r\nJapan's initial problem was to gain the mastery of the sea at the\r\noutset as an absolute essential; without it the employment of land\r\nforces would either be impossible or carried on at an enormous and\r\nperhaps fatal risk in the transportation of troops from the Japanese\r\nislands to the mainland Asia, or in supplying and reinforcing them when\r\nlanded. The sea must be cleared of hostile warships before the war\r\ncould really begin; and the complete success with which this problem\r\nwas solved at surprisingly small cost rivals the brilliant achievements\r\nof the British navy which deprived the first Napoleon of any chance of\r\nsuccess in war outside the European mainland, ruined his campaign in\r\nEgypt and made hopeless an attack upon the British Islands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Main Ambition]\r\n\r\nReviewing the results of the whole campaign, we can see that the main\r\nobjective was the capture of Port Arthur; this largely from the\r\nmilitary point of view, still more largely from the standpoint of\r\nsentiment, national pride, prestige with the world at large, and from\r\nconsiderations of statecraft. Japan had taken Port Arthur once before,\r\nfrom China, and was obliged to relinquish it to Russia. Its recapture\r\nthis time no doubt meant more to the Mikado's subjects than any other\r\nresult of the war; whatever else might happen, that was triumph enough.\r\n\r\nTo the outside world Japan could hardly present a more striking proof\r\nof her prowess than the reduction of this fortress supposed to be\r\nimpregnable; while in the final settlement at the end of the war its\r\npossession would mean an immensely important diplomatic point of\r\nvantage. From the strictly military viewpoint, the loss of Port Arthur\r\ntook away from Russia the only hope of an effective naval base to which\r\nher Baltic fleet could safely resort, and from which she might hope to\r\nrebuild her shattered sea power. Vladivostock being manifestly\r\nineffective, from its position to the north of Japan, as well as\r\nbecause it is ice-bound during a great part of the year. Oyama's\r\ncampaign is thus seen to have been chiefly to give General Nogi a free\r\nhand at Port Arthur, keeping Kuropatkin well away from the chance of\r\nrelieving the fortress. If the Russian army could be destroyed or\r\nseriously crippled, so much the better; but Oyama had evidently been\r\nquite content to take no risk of disaster to himself by trying to do\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\nThis seems to explain the apparent slowness and the ineffectiveness of\r\nhis movements at times. He seems to have been satisfied to keep\r\nKuropatkin simply in a position where he could do nothing to raise the\r\nsiege of Port Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe avowed purpose of Japan in beginning war was simply to drive Russia\r\nout of the Chinese dominions, which it had agreed to evacuate in the\r\nautumn of 1903, but had failed to carry out the agreement. The first\r\nyear of war ended with the accomplishment of that purpose in as forward\r\na state as could have been reasonably expected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rival Armies]\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that during the year Japan in all has had 490,000\r\nfighting men in her armies and navy. Of these 100,000 invested,\r\nbesieged and captured Port Arthur. Three hundred thousand made up the\r\narmies in Manchuria. Sixty thousand are along lines of communication\r\nand in garrison at strategic points, while naval forces at bases and\r\nwith the fleets numbered about 30,000. On land Japan's united armies\r\nwere commanded by Field Marshal Marquis Oyama, while right, centre and\r\nleft--each a completely organized army--were commanded respectively by\r\nGenerals Kuroki, Nodzu and Oku.\r\n\r\nThe Port Arthur army, then dwindled from 100,000 men to a mere garrison\r\nand police force, was commanded by General Nogi.\r\n\r\nThe united Russian armies were commanded by General Kuropatkin.\r\nProminent divisional leaders were Generals Stakelberg, Gripenberg,\r\nLinevitch and Mistchenko, the latter commanding the Cossack forces.\r\nPort Arthur was defended by General Stoessel, then homeward bound on\r\nparole to undergo court-martial, though commanding the world's\r\nadmiration for the defense of Port Arthur.\r\n\r\nAt sea Admiral Togo and Vice-Admiral Kamimura had led the Japanese\r\nfleets to uninterrupted victory. Russia's naval commanders had been\r\nVice-Admirals Makaroff, Wirenius and Witzhdoft, while Rear Admiral\r\nRozndestvensky commanded the Baltic squadron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cost in Men]\r\n\r\nThe year's fighting had been enormously costly in men, and only\r\nestimates could be given. The total number of killed was estimated at\r\n125,000, of whom 65,000 were Japanese and 60,000 were Russians. The\r\nwounded numbered approximately 265,000, and with the missing the total\r\ncasualties were swelled to 400,000 men. Of the wounded a very large\r\npercentage recovered. The Japanese losses exceeded the Russian,\r\nparticularly at Port Arthur and in the battle of Liaoyang, the Russians\r\nbeing protected by fortifications which the Japanese attacked from the\r\nopen. At the battle of the Sha-ho River the casualties were nearly\r\neven, the armies fighting under the same conditions. The accuracy of\r\nthe Japanese artillery and rifle fire is accountable for the fact that\r\nthe Russian loss is not far less, proportionately.\r\n\r\nOf casualties among her more prominent leaders, Japan has been\r\nremarkably free, while Russia has suffered heavily. Among her fallen\r\nleaders were Generals Rutkozsky, Krondrachenko, said to have been the\r\nreal defender of Port Arthur, and General Count Kellar. Admiral\r\nMakaroff went down with the _Petropavlovsk_ at the entrance to the\r\nharbor of Port Arthur; Admiral Witoft was killed on his flagship in the\r\nnaval battle of August 10. A loss in which all the world shared was\r\nthat of the Artist Vassili Verestchagin, who perished with Makaroff on\r\nthe _Petropavlovsk_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cost in Dollars]\r\n\r\nThe actual outlay of both nations for the first year of the war was\r\nabout $800,000,000. Russian expenses were $500,000,000 and Japan's\r\n$350,000,000. To Russia's losses must be added the value of\r\nfortifications, property of all kinds, stores and munitions captured by\r\nJapan at Port Arthur, Dalny, Niuchwang, Haicheng and Liao-yang. These\r\nrepresent an outlay of approximately $500,000,000, in which is included\r\nthe value of the ships destroyed in the harbor of Port Arthur. Russia's\r\nprovisions for war expenses to the end of 1905 comprehended a total\r\nexpenditure of $850,000,000. Japan's total outlay for two years was\r\nestimated to fall $200,000,000 below that figure. Both countries had\r\nnegotiated foreign loans running from seven to twenty-five years, so\r\nthat another generation would still feel the financial burden of the\r\nwar then in progress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cost in Ships]\r\n\r\nThe war had spelled complete disaster for Russia's Asiatic fleet except\r\nfor two patched ships of problematical effectiveness then at\r\nVladivostock. Russia had lost thirty-five vessels of war of all\r\nclasses. Of these the chief were: Battleships--_Petropavlovsk_,\r\ndestroyed by mine at Port Arthur; _Retvisan_, _Pobieda_, _Poltava_, and\r\n_Peresviet_, sunk by guns from 203-Metre Hill; _Czarevitch_, disarmed\r\nat Shanghai; _Sevastopol_, blown up by the Russians at the fall of Port\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\nCruisers--_Boyarin_, _Bayan_, _Pallada_, _Varyag_, _Rurik_, _Rossia_,\r\n_Lena_, _Novik_, _Giliak_, _Bogatyr_, sunk, beached or destroyed;\r\n_Askold_, _Diana_, _Gromboi_, disarmed in Chinese ports.\r\n\r\nGunboats, etc.--_Korietz_ and _Yenesei_ and twelve others including\r\ntorpedo boats and destroyers, destroyed.\r\n\r\nJapan's losses in battle were confined to torpedo-boats and\r\ntorpedo-boat destroyers, sixteen of such craft having been destroyed in\r\nattacks on Port Arthur. The battleship _Hatsuse_ was sunk, as were also\r\nthe cruisers _Usiyako_, _Saiyen_ and _Yoshino_. Three transports were\r\nsunk by ships of the Vladivostock squadron.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International Incidents]\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the war Mr. Hay, Secretary of State, proposed to the\r\nPowers that, jointly, they agree to guarantee the neutrality of China\r\nand call upon the belligerents to restrict the war zone accordingly.\r\nCounter charges of violations had been made by Russia and Japan. It was\r\nconceded that China had earnestly striven to fulfil her obligations\r\nunder trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn July 17 Russian auxiliary cruisers stopped, searched and seized\r\nneutral ships in the Red Sea, precipitating a grave crisis in which\r\nGreat Britain took a conspicuous part. On representations of the\r\nBritish Foreign Office, Russia released captive ships and recalled the\r\nships. The fact that they had traversed the Dardanelles for a warlike\r\npurpose was the basis of the protest.\r\n\r\nOn October 22, the Russian Baltic fleet, passing through the North Sea\r\nen route to the Indian Ocean, fired on the Hull fishing fleet. Two men\r\nwere killed, a number were wounded and one trawler was sunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GARRISON OF PORT ARTHUR LEAVING THE FORTRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe firing was alleged to have resulted from an attack on the Russian\r\nships by Japanese torpedo-boats. After a week, in which war seemed\r\ncertain, the question of culpability was entrusted by consent of both\r\nGovernments to an international commission, to sit at Paris. A German\r\nvessel was also fired on by the Russian fleet, but Germany accepted\r\nRussian explanations and the owners were indemnified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lessons of the War]\r\n\r\nSome of the practical lessons gleaned from the actual warfare were\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n(1) That torpedo-boats were craft of immense possibilities, capable of\r\neven greater development.\r\n\r\n(2) That the destroyer had proved a failure; of the 24 vessels of this\r\ntype in and before Port Arthur not one made a hit.\r\n\r\n(3) That battleships were necessary to successful naval warfare.\r\n\r\n(4) That \"team work\" in armies, as exemplified in the Japanese\r\nmovements, was a matter of primary importance.\r\n\r\n(5) That short range fighting was decidedly not a thing of the past, as\r\nhad been believed.\r\n\r\n(6) That the use of hand grenades promised to introduce a new and\r\nparticularly horrid form of attack and defense.\r\n\r\n(7) That modern fortifications were impregnable to direct assault,\r\nhowever effective a preliminary bombardment.\r\n\r\n(8) That the success or failure of sieges of modernly fortified\r\npositions depended upon the effectiveness of the engineer, miner and\r\nsapper.\r\n\r\n(9) That the floating mine was an instrument of destruction against\r\nwhich the most powerful ship was helpless.\r\n\r\n(10) Wounds inflicted by modern arms heal readily. While the war had\r\ndemonstrated anew that one man in five was killed in battle, it had\r\nshown that an amazing proportion of the wounded were soon back on the\r\nfiring line. The clean wound of the steel rifle projectile yielded to\r\ntreatment even when vital organs were pierced. The medical records of\r\nthe war were among its most notable features.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chronology of First Year of War]\r\n\r\nFebruary 5--Japanese and Russian representatives at St. Petersburg and\r\nTokio given their passports.\r\n\r\nFebruary 7--Japanese seize Masanpho, Korea as a troop base.\r\n\r\nFebruary 8-9--_Varyag_ and _Korietz_ destroyed in Chemulpo harbor, and\r\nTogo attacks Port Arthur fleet.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10--Czar declares war.

Its\r\ncapture was the most brilliant achievement of Japanese arms, and its\r\ndefense perhaps the most glorious page in Russian annals. Invested on\r\nMay 5, 1904, the fortress held out till failing ammunition forced the\r\nsurrender of January 2, 1905--242 days. Direct attacks opened on August\r\n19. City, fort and fleet have been valued at $270,000,000; all were\r\ndestroyed, at a cost to the besiegers of $100,000,000 and more than\r\n30,000 lives; fully 70,000 Japanese were wounded in the various attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  After Port Arthur--Raids in Manchuria--The Battle of\r\n    Sandepu--Kuropatkin Asks for Reinforcements--The North Sea\r\n    Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After Port Arthur]\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Port Arthur, the Russo-Japanese War entered upon an\r\nentirely new phase. Although the situation of the gigantic armies that\r\nfaced one another across the Sha-ho River remained unchanged, the\r\nstrategic problems to be solved by their instrumentality were in effect\r\ntransformed. The struggle for the possession of the great naval\r\nfortress had operated as a vitiating factor in the military counsels of\r\nboth belligerents. Japan had sacrificed between 50,000 and 100,000 of\r\nher best soldiers in bringing the six months' siege to a triumphant\r\nissue, and in doing so had, by dividing her armies, moreover, forfeited\r\nthe opportunity of dealing a crushing blow at her adversary. The\r\nmagnificent infantry that broke themselves in so many vain assaults\r\nupon the fortifications of Port Arthur might have enabled Oyama to turn\r\nthe Russian retreat at Liao-yang into a rout, or to drive the Russians,\r\nafter the battle of the Sha-ho, back beyond Mukden. On the other hand,\r\nKuropatkin had found himself hampered at every turn by the instructions\r\nimposed on him from St. Petersburg to attempt the relief of the\r\nbeleaguered fortress, by which was symbolized so much of the pride and\r\nprestige of the Russian Empire. In the game of chess a strong player,\r\nto handicap himself against a weaker, will sometimes undertake to mate\r\nwith a certain piece. If the piece is lost, the game is lost, and\r\ntherefore the player's defence is awkwardly compromised by being\r\ndivided in aim--between protecting his vital piece and at the same time\r\nshielding his king from checkmate. Very similar was the task imposed on\r\nthe unhappy generalissimo of the Czar, who, while trying to baffle\r\nOyama's vigorous combination, had to keep one eye always on Port\r\nArthur. The fall of Port Arthur at least set free both combatants from\r\na distracting preoccupation, and to that degree it was a strength to\r\neither side. But its ulterior effects were much less evenly balanced.\r\nThe capture of Port Arthur at one stroke deprived Russian arms of the\r\npossibility of complete triumph, whatever issue future military\r\noperations might have; and it secured Japan from the last lingering\r\nfear of disastrous defeat. When the remnant of the once powerful\r\nPacific Squadron fell into the hands of the Mikado's soldiers, Russia's\r\nlast hope of recovering, during the present war, the command of the sea\r\nexpired utterly; and without the command of the sea, Kuropatkin's boast\r\nof \"settling the terms of peace at Tokio\" could obviously never be\r\nfulfilled. Even if invincible armies swept Oyama out of Manchuria, out\r\nof Liao-tung Peninsula, and out of Korea itself, there would still be\r\nthe impassable Straits of Korea to render the victory barren and to\r\nimpose their inexorable \"Thus far and no further\". As a matter of fact\r\nit became evident to the whole world that, with Japan supreme by sea,\r\nthe continuance of the war would only be a costly futility for Russia,\r\nin which she had everything to lose and nothing to gain--a struggle in\r\nwhich she was exhausting herself to no possible purpose. Her adversary\r\nhad already won the odd-trick, and the only doubt that remained to be\r\nsolved was how near she would get to making grand slam. But the blind\r\narrogance and reckless folly which had precipitated Russia into a\r\nwanton war for which she was utterly unprepared, were still obdurate to\r\nconviction even by the logic of such disastrous events. Nothing is more\r\nstubborn than wounded pride, or more blind than baffled vanity. The\r\nmore desperate the situation, the more perversely bent became the\r\nbureaucracy of Russia in prolonging it, and in refusing to recognize\r\nfacts which impeached the competence and sagacity of the existing\r\nrégime. Already the strain of maintaining the army in Manchuria had\r\nbegun to have its effect at home in widespread distress and growing\r\ndiscontent among the peasant and industrial classes. The characteristic\r\nremedy of the governing clique was to attempt not a cure, but a\r\ndiversion. Kuropatkin was ordered to renew his activity and to achieve\r\nsomething that could be represented as a victory at any cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAMBOO GUN AT PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Raids in Manchuria]\r\n\r\nSince the last great battle in October--the battle of the Sha-ho, when\r\nKuropatkin's ill-advised offensive had been converted into a perilous\r\nretreat that almost degenerated into disaster--the two opposing armies\r\nhad been practically quiescent. Before they had either recovered from\r\nthe exhaustion of their last tremendous struggle--before their awful\r\nlosses could be repaired and their depleted stores and supplies could\r\nbe replenished--the inexorable grasp of the Manchurian winter had\r\nfallen upon them and frozen them into immobility. While the last\r\ncritical acts in the siege of Port Arthur were being enacted, the\r\ntroops of Oyama and Kuropatkin were occupied only in maintaining a\r\njealous vigilance on each other, and in digging themselves into their\r\nwinter quarters. In a climate that is almost Arctic in its severity,\r\nwhere the temperature is regularly for weeks and months together 30 and\r\n40 degrees below freezing-point, active campaigning would be\r\nimpossible, even if the deep snow under which the face of the country\r\nis buried did not make transport impossible. Each army proceeded to\r\nentrench itself securely and to construct huts or dig out shelters in\r\nthe ground in which the troops could find it possible to sustain life.\r\nThe sufferings of the devoted soldiers during these months of inaction\r\nmust have been intense, and on both sides the roll of casualties from\r\nexposure and frost-bite was appalling. Week after week went by without\r\nany incident other than trifling affairs of outposts being recorded in\r\nthe meagre dispatches given to the world by the authorities at Tokio\r\nand St. Petersburg. It has always been the Russian habit, however, to\r\ncloak failure in essentials by proclaiming success in trifles; and from\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin came a steady trickle of trivial information about\r\nbrushes between patrols and pickets, wherein the Japanese were always\r\nworsted, with the loss of a horse and rifle, or perhaps even of a\r\ncooking-stove. But on the very day that the negotiations for the\r\nsurrender of Port Arthur were opened, a serious interruption to the\r\nlong inactivity on the Sha-ho occurred. The Russians attempted for the\r\nfirst time a raid on the Japanese line of communications. It was an\r\nattempt that an enterprising enemy would have made long before; for it\r\nis to be remembered that every mile of the Japanese advance from the\r\nsea rendered them increasingly dependent on the railway which they had\r\ntaken from the Russians. Their army on the Sha-ho was, roughly\r\nspeaking, more than one hundred miles from the nearest sea-base,\r\nNiuchwang; and any interruption to that vulnerable line of\r\ncommunications must inflict much inconvenience at least on Marshal\r\nOyama. The Russians, of course, were exposed to the same risk, and the\r\nlong line between Mukden and Harbin had, in fact, frequently been cut\r\nby the Chunchuses--roving bands of fierce native horsemen, whose hatred\r\nfor the Muscovite invader had proved a valuable auxiliary to the\r\nJapanese. Their activity, in many cases organized and directed by\r\nJapanese officers, compelled Kuropatkin to guard jealously every mile\r\nof the railway in his rear, and especially every bridge and culvert,\r\nand this necessity of maintaining large forces on the lines of\r\ncommunication seriously detracted from the effective strength of his\r\narmies in the field. The Russians' idea of giving their enemy tit-tat\r\nwas at first merely tentative, however. A couple of officers,\r\npractically unattended, managed to make their way southward almost as\r\nfar as Hai-cheng, which is itself some forty or fifty miles south of\r\nLiao-yang. There they succeeded in blowing up a culvert and tearing up\r\nsome yards of railway line--damage which, though not serious in itself,\r\nwas enough to encourage similar attempts on a larger scale. Kuropatkin\r\nknew that the bulk of the army which had been engaged in the siege of\r\nPort Arthur was about to be entrained northward, and that with these\r\nreinforcements for Oyama were to go the great siege trains which had\r\nbeen employed in battering the ships and fortifications of the captured\r\nfortress into submission. To cut off these reinforcements, perhaps to\r\ncapture train-loads of men and destroy some of the enemy's most\r\nformidable artillery, would evidently be a great counter-stroke to the\r\neffect produced by the fall of Port Arthur; and so a great Cossack raid\r\nwas authorized on the Japanese lines of communication. The scheme was\r\nadmirably conceived and organized, and it achieved at least the first\r\nand most important condition of success--namely, a complete surprise.\r\nAt the outbreak of the war it was predicted in many quarters that what\r\nmust certainly turn the scale in favor of the Russian arms was Russia's\r\noverwhelming superiority in cavalry. The experience of the Boer War had\r\nleft fresh in every mind the incalculable value of mobility. Now\r\nRussia, in her hordes of Cossack horse, possessed a cavalry which had\r\nthe reputation of being unique in the world. \"Other countries have\r\ninfantry, artillery and cavalry; but Russia is alone in possessing\r\nCossacks,\" said one distinguished general shortly after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities. But as the campaign progressed, critics began to revise\r\ntheir judgments. The terrible Cossack horsemen, for some reason or\r\nother, failed to play any considerable part in events. They attempted a\r\nraid in Korea from the northeast, but without any result, and in the\r\nsubsequent fighting they found no opportunity for asserting themselves.\r\nThe campaign was an infantry and artillery campaign entirely; and the\r\nnotorious weakness of the Japanese army in cavalry was no impediment to\r\ntheir victorious advance. The war in Manchuria proved in fact that the\r\nconditions of the war in South Africa had been peculiar and\r\nexceptional. But at last the Cossacks were to be given an opportunity\r\nof showing their mettle. On January 8th a force of 6,000 Cossacks under\r\nGeneral Mistchenko crossed the Hun-ho and began to march rapidly\r\nsouthwards. This formidable force, composed of three brigades, was\r\naccompanied by six batteries of light artillery, and in its\r\norganization everything had been done to give to it the _maximum_ of\r\nmobility. The Hun-ho, which Mistchenko's division crossed immediately\r\nafter setting out, is a tributary of the Liao River, into which it\r\nflows some forty or fifty miles above Niuchwang. While the course of\r\nthe Liao is roughly due north, that of the Hun is northeast, or almost\r\ndirectly in the line from Mukden to Niuchwang. The severity of the\r\nweather had moderated and was most favorable for the movement of such a\r\ngreat body of mounted men, who swept down the vast Liao plain on a\r\nfront extending for five miles. By the second night Mistchenko's three\r\nbrigades had reached the confluence of the Liao and the Hun, and there\r\nthey made the first contact with the enemy. A Japanese convoy was\r\ncaptured, but the escort succeeded in making its escape, and from that\r\nmoment it was impossible to conceal knowledge of the movement from the\r\nenemy. With their characteristic thoroughness--which throughout this\r\nwar has left nothing unforeseen and nothing unprovided for--the\r\nJapanese had organized a plan for giving instant warning of a raid on\r\nthe line to the troops guarding all the depots and the lines of\r\ncommunication, in case of any surprise attack such as that devised by\r\nMistchenko. Great beacon fires had been laid at intervals up and down\r\nthe country, and the kindling of one of these--the signal of\r\napproaching danger--was sufficient to set the whole plain from\r\nNiuchwang to Liao-yang ablaze with warning flame. No sooner had the\r\nCossacks made their first capture than a house in the village which\r\nthey had entered suddenly began to emit heavy columns of black smoke,\r\nfollowed by leaping tongues of fire; and so well had the house been\r\nfilled with combustibles, that every effort to extinguish the fire was\r\nvain. Nor had the portent been unobserved. As soon as darkness closed\r\non the scene, the horizon north, south and east was illuminated with\r\nthe answerable flash of innumerable beacons that passed on from one to\r\nanother the tidings of the enemy's approach. All hope of surprise being\r\nnow at an end, the only resource left was to strike swiftly before\r\ntroops could be hurried down from the front to the threatened points on\r\nthe railway. Mistchenko's division separated into three bodies--one\r\nmoving due south towards Niuchwang, another making due east for the\r\nrailway above Haicheng, and the third striking southeast towards\r\nTashichao, where the branch-line from Niuchwang meets the main line\r\nrunning north and south. The third body almost immediately encountered\r\na force of Chunchuses, 500 strong, armed with Mausers and led by\r\nJapanese officers. This force, though overwhelmingly outnumbered,\r\nfought with desperate bravery until they were cut to pieces. At another\r\nvillage, held by 500 Japanese infantry, the raiders again encountered a\r\nstubborn resistance which they could not overcome; but they swept on\r\nsouthwards, and reached Old Niuchwang at noon on January 11th. Here\r\nsome 50 Japanese soldiers, the only garrison, shut themselves in a\r\nhouse, and, refusing to surrender, held their own. But they could not\r\nprevent the enemy from wreaking destruction on the stores which had\r\nbeen accumulated in the town; and many large transports were burnt.\r\nYinkow, or the port of Niuchwang, had for many months been the\r\nprincipal base of supplies for Oyama's army, as being the seaport\r\nnearest to the front, and to work havoc at this vital depot was the\r\nprincipal purpose of Mistchenko's raid. On January 12th the Cossacks\r\napproached Yinkow Station, where army stores of enormous value had been\r\naccumulated, and opened fire with their six batteries. But the\r\npromptitude of the Japanese commanders foiled the attack at this\r\ncritical point. In spite of the cutting of the line north and south of\r\nHai-cheng, reinforcements had been got through, and the attack on\r\nYinkow Station was resisted by 1,000 riflemen, well entrenched. Against\r\ntheir accurate and well-sustained fire Mistchenko's Cossacks, in spite\r\nof artillery support, could make no headway; and as the casualty list\r\nmounted up, the Russian general was obliged to draw off, lest the\r\nmobility of his retreat should be encumbered by too many wounded. Some\r\ndamage was done to the station buildings, but it was trivial compared\r\nwith that which the raiders had set out to effect; and from that moment\r\nthe only concern of Mistchenko was how to make good his escape from the\r\nforces that were rapidly concentrating upon his line of retreat. He had\r\nfailed not only to destroy the stores of the enemy, but even to inflict\r\nany serious damage on the railway line. The boast of his detachments\r\ndetailed for the latter purpose that they had torn up 600 yards of line\r\nnorth of Hai-cheng, and had blown up the bridge at Tashichao, were\r\nobvious exaggerations; or it would not have been possible for the\r\nJapanese to move down the reinforcements that secured the repulse of\r\nthe attack on Yinkow Station. With the whole country roused against\r\nhim, Mistchenko, encumbered as he was with many wounded, might have\r\nfound it difficult to break back over the 80 or 100 miles to be\r\ntraversed before he could count himself in safety. His horses and men\r\nwere both more or less exhausted with the five days' continuous\r\nmarching and fighting; but an easy and convenient resource was open to\r\nhim by simply invading and passing through neutral Chinese territory.\r\nOn the outbreak of the war, the belligerents, at the instigation of the\r\nPowers, led by the United States, had agreed to respect absolutely the\r\nneutrality of China, and to confine military operations to the left or\r\neastern side of the great Liao River. But necessity knows no law, and\r\nMistchenko, finding that his road northward from Niuchwang was blocked\r\nby a strong force detached by Oku for the purpose of intercepting his\r\nretreat, promptly wheeled westward and crossed the Liao River some\r\nmiles below its junction with the Hun-ho. Thenceforth his progress was\r\neasy. It was as if a football player were to run down the field behind\r\nthe touch-lines in order to reach the goal. The flagrancy of the\r\nstratagem would have called for less remark if Russia had not chosen\r\nthis precise moment to address representations to the Powers\r\ncomplaining of acts done by the Japanese in violation of China's\r\nneutrality. As it was, the casualties suffered were heavy--at least 500\r\nall told--and though it was ostentatiously announced from St.\r\nPetersburg that such raids would in future be of frequent occurrence,\r\nthis descent upon Niuchwang remained a solitary as well as a barren\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle of Sandepu]\r\n\r\nBut again the inactivity of the armies was to be broken before the\r\nmonth of January had come to an end. The second Manchurian army, the\r\ncommand of which had been committed to General Gripenberg, had now been\r\nbrought up to strength, and almost immediately proceeded to put itself\r\nin evidence. On the 25th General Kuropatkin telegraphed to the Czar\r\nannouncing briefly two facts--that the offensive had been begun against\r\nthe enemy on the right (or western) flank; and that the thermometer\r\nregistered 16 degrees of frost. The full significance of this message\r\nonly appeared a few days later, when it was revealed that an attempt in\r\nforce was being made to turn the Japanese left. The main objective of\r\nthe Russian attack was the village of Sandepu, the main northwest\r\nposition of the Japanese left army. It will be remembered that after\r\nthe battle of Yentai or the Sha-ho, which took place in October, the\r\nJapanese were left holding a front of fifty miles or more along the\r\nsouth bank of the Sha-ho, a tributary to the Hun-ho, running roughly\r\ndue east and west at a distance of ten or fifteen miles south of\r\nMukden. The Russian position faced the Japanese on the other bank of\r\nthe Sha-ho, and then inclined away northwest in the direction of\r\nHsinmintun, a Chinese town on the west bank of the Liao River, from\r\nwhich the Russian army had for a long time been drawing large supplies,\r\nin contempt of the neutrality of China. Sandepu is over thirty miles\r\nsouth of Mukden, and lies in the angle made by the Hun River with the\r\nrailway. It consists of some hundred houses, or farmsteads, each\r\nsurrounded by high walls of sun-dried bricks, about three feet thick.\r\nLoop-holed for musketry, these walls, form an admirable defence,\r\nespecially as the surrounding country is quite open and flat. But at\r\nthis season of the year, the Hun-ho, which is a natural defence to the\r\nflank of an army resting on Sandepu, is frozen over to a thickness of\r\nseveral feet, and can be safely crossed both by men and transport. The\r\nRussians, 85,000 strong, and with no less than 350 guns, moved\r\nsouthwards down the right bank of the Hun-ho until they reached a point\r\na few miles southwest of Sandepu, and there they crossed the frozen\r\nriver and occupied two villages in which the Japanese had stationed\r\noutposts. On the 26th the Russians, who had at the same time crossed\r\nthe Hun at Chang-tau, again advanced, encountering a steadily\r\nincreasing resistance and seized after a fierce fight the village of\r\nSha-ho-pu, a few miles northeast of Sandepu, and from that moment the\r\naction became general. The capture of Sandepu was essential to any\r\nattempt to roll up the Japanese left, and to this object the Russian\r\nforces now set themselves with fierce determination. On January 27th,\r\nafter giving an account of much promiscuous fighting, General\r\nKuropatkin announced to the Czar that \"in the evening, after a\r\ndesperate fight, our troops having, with the help of the sappers,\r\nsurmounted all artificial obstacles entered the village of Sandepu,\r\nwhich is large and strongly entrenched.\" Unfortunately, however, for\r\nthe triumph of the Russian arms, this announcement proved to be\r\npremature--or rather to be an incomplete version of the actual fact.\r\nThe Russian troops entered Sandepu only to be driven back after a\r\ndesperate struggle; and the indomitable Japanese infantrymen who manned\r\nthe loop-holed walls of the hamlet were never dislodged from their\r\nposition. This successful stand was the turning point of the battle. It\r\nchecked the flank movement of the Russians and gave Oku time to bring\r\nup his reinforcements and deliver his counter-stroke. The Russian\r\nattack had been from the west and northwest, the object being to\r\nenvelop the Japanese extreme left. The movement was met by an extension\r\nof the Japanese left, which in turn threatened to outflank the\r\noutflankers. On the southwest of Sandepu the Russians were driven back\r\nalong the line of the Hun-ho, and soon the battle centred about the\r\nvillage of Heikautai, a few miles southwest of Sandepu. That this was\r\nno mere affair of outposts may be gathered from the fact that the\r\nRussian force was made up of two divisions of the Eighth Army Corps,\r\ntwo brigades of Russo-European Rifles, one division of the Tenth Army\r\nCorps, part of a division of reserve infantry, and part of the First\r\nSiberian Army Corps, and a large force of Cossacks under Mistchenko. On\r\nthe 27th and 28th, the fighting became desperately fierce and after the\r\nJapanese had succeeded in carrying Heikautai and the surrounding\r\npositions, they were exposed to repeated night attacks before the\r\nRussians at last made up their minds to accept defeat. From Russian\r\nsources came the usually inconsistent story--a story in which a long\r\nseries of unbroken successes culminated inexplicably in an admission of\r\nfailure and retreat. It now appeared that far from capturing Sandepu,\r\nthe Russian column that attacked that place lost twenty-four officers\r\nand 1,600 men killed and wounded by coming unexpecedly upon \"a triple\r\nrow of artificial obstacles\" on the ground swept by artillery and\r\nmachine-gun fire which the Russian gunners could not subdue. This\r\nintelligence came as a severe disappointment to the friends of Russia,\r\nwho had begun to believe that the tide of war had at last begun to\r\nturn, and that Russian arms were about to secure their first victory.\r\nEager strategists in St. Petersburg pointed out that Sandepu was only\r\ntwenty or thirty miles from Liao-yang, and that its retention would be\r\nsuch a serious menace to the Japanese line of retreat that the\r\nevacuation of the whole position on the Sha-ho would be a necessity.\r\nAlas! while these fascinating speculations were being indulged in, the\r\nRussian Army of the right was already in full retreat, and was indeed\r\nsuffering appalling losses in the effort to extricate itself from the\r\ntoils of the enemy. The fighting round Heikautai lasted five days, and\r\nthe issue almost to the last hung in doubt. The capture of Heikautai\r\nhad become necessary to the security of the Japanese position, but\r\nrepeated attacks on it had been repulsed. The spirit in which the\r\nemergency was met is revealed in the laconic words of Marshal Oyama's\r\ndispatch. \"Our object had not been attained, so I encouraged all the\r\ncolumns to make night attacks. All the columns of the attacking parties\r\nexpected annihilation. We attempted several attack movements, but\r\nsuffered heavily from the enemy's artillery, and especially from the\r\nmachine-guns, but all the columns continued the attack with all their\r\nmight. The enemy was unable to withstand our vigorous attack, and began\r\nto retreat at half past five in the morning. Our forces charging into\r\nHeikautai, occupied the place firmly and entirely by half past nine in\r\nthe morning.\" The net result of the battle was to give the Japanese\r\nsecure possession of a line east and west of Hun-ho and south of\r\nMukden, and to inflict on the Russians casualties which certainly\r\nexceeded 10,000, and probably reached 15,000. In war especially \"the\r\nattempt and not the deed\" confounds. It is not the first step but the\r\nlast that costs--not the attack, but the retreat after repulse. No\r\nsooner had the failure of this big attempt on the Japanese left been\r\nfully confirmed than it became known that the movement had been\r\ndirected by General Gripenberg, the commander of the Second Manchurian\r\nArmy. When, after the battle of Liao-yang, the Czar sanctioned the\r\nformation of this Second Army and committed the command of it to\r\nGeneral Gripenberg, there was a great flourish of journalistic trumpets\r\nin the Russian and French press. At last Kuropatkin would have not only\r\nan \"Army worthy of the might and dignity of Russia,\" but would have a\r\nlieutenant worthy of himself to share the tremendous strain of\r\ndirecting nearly half a million of men. The two Generals exchanged\r\ncordial messages, and then Gripenberg set out for Harbin to superintend\r\nthe gradual organization of his Second Army. By the end of the year its\r\nunits had been completed, and then the impatience of General Gripenberg\r\nto assert himself appears to have become uncontrollable. He conceived\r\nthe movement against the Japanese left--a movement that might easily\r\nhave achieved substantial results if the Japanese had not been so well\r\nprepared for it--and his direct responsibility for it was made patent\r\nto the world by the angry and undignified recriminations between him\r\nand Kuropatkin that followed the repulse. General Gripenberg\r\nimmediately asked to be relieved of his command, ostensibly on the\r\nground of ill health, but really as he allowed to be perfectly\r\nmanifest, in dudgeon at the treatment which he alleged had been meted\r\nout to him by his superior officer. He claimed that his flanking\r\nmovement had in fact succeeded, and that he only needed reinforcements\r\nto maintain the position he had won. He complained loudly that he\r\napplied very urgently for these reinforcements, but that they were\r\nwithheld, and that he was not even supported in his retreat by a\r\ndiversion in other parts of the field. A great victory had been within\r\nhis grasp, General Gripenberg represented, and it had been snatched\r\nfrom him simply by the perverse inactivity of General Kuropatkin. So\r\nstrained were the relations at headquarters that General Gripenberg's\r\nrequest to be relieved of his command was immediately complied with,\r\nand the General set off post-haste back to St. Petersburg to lay his\r\ncomplaints personally before the Czar. The quarrel was conducted\r\npractically in public by the advocates of the two rivals; and General\r\nKuropatkin's friends were not slow to put forward his side of the case.\r\nAccording to this account, General Gripenberg's costly defeat was\r\ncaused directly by his deliberate disobedience to instructions. He had\r\nbeen permitted to embark on his movement against the Japanese left on\r\nthe strict understanding that it was to be only in the nature of a\r\nreconnaissance in force, and that a general action was not to be\r\nforced. While nominally accepting these limitations, General Gripenberg\r\nhad in his heart rebelled against them, and had not hesitated to commit\r\nhis army to a pitched battle beyond the reach of support, and in\r\nconditions of weather which made the movement of troops most\r\nundesirable. Finally it was contended that General Kuropatkin had done\r\nall he could to relieve the pressure on General Gripenberg by\r\nbombarding the Japanese right and centre, and threatening an advance in\r\nthose directions. The wrangle could not but be ignominious, but at\r\nleast more dignity pertained to the disputant who remained at his post\r\nand strove to repair the blunder that had been committed than to the\r\ndisputant that threw down his responsibilities and went home in a pet.\r\nThis view of the case seems to have prevailed with the Czar himself,\r\nwhose reception of General Gripenberg was not cordial. According to the\r\nreports that came from well-informed French sources, the Czar took\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin's part very decidedly, and administered to General\r\nGripenberg a severe rebuke for his insubordination. Whatever the\r\ncharacter of the frequent audiences which the disappointed General had\r\nof his Sovereign, the fact remained that Kuropatkin was maintained in\r\nthe supreme command of the armies in Manchuria, and that while General\r\nGripenberg lingered in St. Petersburg, if not in disgrace, at least in\r\ninactivity, General Kaulbars was definitely appointed to the command of\r\nthe Second Manchurian Army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE SLOPES OF OJIKEISHAN, BEFORE PORT ARTHUR.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin Asks for Reinforcements]\r\n\r\nIf this five days' desperate fighting scarcely affected the position of\r\nthe two armies, it inflicted on the Russian armies the discouragement\r\nof another defeat at the hands of a numerically inferior force, and the\r\nmoral effect of adding to this unbroken series of reverses is not\r\neasily computed. With troops less dogged and devoted than those of the\r\nCzar, demoralization would have set in long before. The anxieties of\r\nKuropatkin were now aggravated, too, by circumstances which no\r\ngeneralship on his part could alleviate and remove. All through the\r\nautumn reinforcements had been pouring along the Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway, the carrying capacity of which had been stretched so\r\nwonderfully by Prince Khilkoff. But even the resources of engineering\r\ngenius have their limits. They cannot contrive a pint pot in such a way\r\nthat it will hold a quart; and the number of trains that can be run\r\nover a single line is fixed inexorably by circumstance. Kuropatkin's\r\nurgent and incessant demands for more and more reinforcements had been\r\nmet in large measure, but only at the expense of the other traffic,\r\nincluding the carriage of military stores. The enormous supplies\r\nrequired to provision and maintain at war efficiency armies numbering\r\nhalf a million of men may be imagined, and for these supplies\r\nKuropatkin had become increasingly dependent on the railway. The more\r\nreinforcements he received the more mouths he had to feed; and the\r\nlonger the campaign endured the less reliance was to be placed on what\r\na devastated and exhausted countryside could provide. During the\r\nearlier months of the war, some relief to the strain on the railway\r\ncould be found by drawing supplies from Vladivostock, which in turn\r\ncould be fed from over-seas; but no sooner had the destruction of the\r\nPort Arthur fleet been completed, than the inexorable Japanese\r\nestablished a strict blockade of Vladivostock, and cut off this last\r\nresource. While the wretched troops amid all the rigors of the\r\nManchurian winter were in need of such ordinary necessities as proper\r\nclothing, fuel, and even food, vast accumulations of stores, more than\r\nsufficient to supply all their needs, were lying rotting on the sidings\r\nof the Siberian Railway, immovable because of the congestion of traffic\r\non the already overburdened line. To add to the anxiety of the\r\nsituation came the grave dislocation caused by the riots and strikes\r\nwhich broke out in all the great industrial and distributive centres of\r\nRussia after the fall of Port Arthur, and which revealed an internal\r\ncrisis even more menacing than the military crisis which confronted the\r\narmy in Manchuria. For weeks together, just at the moment that prompt\r\nand vigorous action was demanded, the whole administrative system of\r\nRussia was paralyzed, and the energies of its directors were absorbed\r\nin staving off domestic revolution instead of in organizing the\r\nmeasures for conducting a foreign war. On the other hand, the Japanese\r\ngenerals had not only the strategic advantage of being within easy\r\ndistance of several sea-bases, but they also were able to rely on a\r\nsystem of supply which is perhaps the most perfect that has ever been\r\nseen in war. The minute prevision with which the necessities of a\r\ncampaign on such an enormous scale had been provided for is well\r\nexemplified by the organization of the Army Medical Service. In spite\r\nof all the hardships and exhaustion to which General Oku's army had\r\nbeen exposed, for instance, the Chief Surgeon was able to report that\r\nfrom the date of its landing on the Liao-tung Peninsula on May 6th to\r\nthe end of January there had only occurred 40 deaths in its ranks from\r\ndisease. The cases of typhoid numbered but 193, and the cases of\r\ndysentery no more than 342. The marvelous character of this record may\r\nbe realized by remembering how appalling were the ravages of disease\r\nduring the South African campaign. Typhoid and dysentery in that war\r\ncarried off infinitely more victims than shell or bullet; and if\r\nsometimes in their assaults on fortified positions the Japanese have\r\nseemed shockingly reckless of human life, it is to be remembered that\r\nin another and not less important direction they have shown themselves\r\ninfinitely more careful of it. Such were the conditions as the long\r\nwinter months drew to their close, and as silently the Japanese armies\r\ngirded themselves for the great stroke which was in a few weeks' time\r\nto eclipse both in magnitude and consequence everything that had\r\nhitherto marked the progress of this epoch-making campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The North Sea Inquiry]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unhappy Baltic Fleet protracted its embarrassing sojourn\r\nin Madagascar waters. Having got so far on the road to its appointed\r\nrevenge, discretion overcame heroic resolution on the part of its\r\nAdmiral. The nearer Rozhdestvensky came to his task of wresting the\r\ncommand of the sea from Admiral Togo, the less he appeared to like it;\r\nand finally the Armada which had begun its voyage with such a\r\nsensational progress through the North Sea, decided to continue to\r\navail itself of French hospitality until it should have received the\r\nreinforcements of the third Baltic Squadron. While the Russian fleet\r\nwas thus ingloriously hung up at Diego Suarez, the International\r\nCommission appointed to inquire into the circumstances of its exploits\r\nin the North Sea met at Paris, and having heard exhaustively the\r\nevidence in support of the British and Russian cases, at length issued\r\nits report. In spite of the preliminary rumors that the conduct of the\r\nRussian Admiral had been vindicated, the event proved that the justice\r\nof the British case had been as completely sustained as it could be by\r\nany judgment which was more diplomatic than judicial in character. The\r\nAdmirals of the Commission, with the exception of their Russian\r\ncolleague, found that there were no hostile torpedo boats present on\r\nthe Dogger Bank; that the British trawlers did nothing to provoke\r\nattack; and that the firing to which they were subjected was\r\nunjustifiable. To coat this rather unpleasant pill, the Commissioners\r\namiably added, in contradiction of the direct implication of their own\r\nfindings, that their report threw no discredit either on the military\r\nquality or the humane sentiments of Admiral Rozhdestvensky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  Rigors of Manchurian Winters--In Winter Quarters--Ear Muffs Won\r\n    by Yankee Thrift--Hot Baths and Hot Meals--Disease Conquered in\r\n    Camp--Wonderful Sanitary Record--Civil War Comparisons--The\r\n    Japanese Scientific--No Detail Overlooked--Wounded Rarely Die.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rigors of Manchurian Winters]\r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of the Sha-ho River the two armies went into winter\r\nquarters prepared to face a Manchurian season with thermometer readings\r\nof 35 degrees below zero not uncommon and with a snowfall of enormous\r\nproportions to contend with. The Russians were better prepared to meet\r\nthe situation than the Japanese since a large proportion of the Russian\r\narmy hailed from Siberia or the northern provinces of Asiatic and\r\nEuropean Russia and hence were inured to rigorous winters. Some\r\nthousands of the Japanese had come from the northern provinces of Japan\r\nand they, too, were well experienced in cold. But a large majority of\r\nthe Japanese troops were from the southern islands of Japan, where\r\nrigorous winters are unknown. The Japanese army administration was thus\r\nconfronted by a very serious problem. The story of the manner in which\r\nthe problem was met and solved is among the most interesting of the\r\nchapters of the history of the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Winter Quarters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ear Muffs Won by Yankee Thrift]\r\n\r\nWhen the positions of the various units of the army had been definitely\r\nfixed the whole army began, as a preliminary step, to burrow into the\r\nearth. Before mid-November the Japanese camp was no longer stretched\r\nover the hills south of the Sha-ho but had vanished from view under the\r\nhills. Along the whole front that stretched for nearly sixty miles\r\nunderground galleries were excavated barely high enough even for a\r\nJapanese to stand erect. These were open at one end and at the entrance\r\nto each a charcoal burning stove was placed. A fire was kept burning\r\ncontinually in each of these thousands of stoves. The stove pipe,\r\ninstead of jutting a foot or two into the air was extended along the\r\nroof of the dug-out to its end, then passed upward through the eight\r\nfeet of soil that formed the roof. Fronting the open end long trenches,\r\nwere dug and over them heavy protective bomb proofs of timber and earth\r\nwere erected as a protection against the shells which with greater or\r\nless activity were hurled into the Japanese lines by the Russians\r\nthroughout the winter. These underground homes solved much of the\r\nquestion of withstanding cold for in them the men were reasonably\r\ncomfortable. Special clothing, too, was provided, and in connection\r\nwith fur ear-muffs with which each man was provided an interesting\r\nstory is told, one typical of the Yankee-like thrift of the Japanese.\r\nFive years before, the plague had been introduced into Japan from the\r\nMalay Peninsula. A vigorous fight was made and the disease was finally\r\nconquered but in the course of the fight the sanitary officials became\r\nconvinced that the germs of the disease were being spread by rats. A\r\nprize was put upon the heads of the dangerous rodents. Millions were\r\nkilled by the boys of Japan who delivered the rats, collected the\r\nbounty and gave no thought to what became of the carcasses. Nor did\r\nanyone, but when the army faced a Manchurian winter those millions of\r\nrat furs reappeared as warm ear protectors while a smile went around\r\nthe world. So completely, in a thousand ingenious ways did the army\r\nofficials conquer the cold and safeguard the army that throughout the\r\nwinter it was even possible for every man in the army to have two hot\r\nbaths a week. The bath in Japan is almost a religious rite, but the\r\ntrooper bade good-bye to it, as he supposed, when he started for the\r\nfront. Not so. Circular metal tubes were provided. These were sunk in\r\nthe ground level with the surface. Ten feet away at the bottom of a\r\ntrench a stove was placed heating a coil of pipes which went inside,\r\naround and around the sides of the tube. The tube served as the tub. It\r\nwas filled with water and in a few minutes the hot bath was ready. In\r\nprotected spots all along the lines Nippon could be seen hastily\r\nstripping beside the steaming hole in the ground. Then he would vanish\r\nuntil only his head was visible. As well as he could he scrubbed\r\nhimself. Comrades raised him swiftly from the tube and swathed him in\r\nheavy blankets, wrapped in which he vanished over the edge of the\r\ntrench and so into his underground home, clean and happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NIGHT ATTACK ON A RUSSIAN POSITION.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hot Baths and Hot Meals]\r\n\r\nHot meals were cooked at the doors of the dugouts for the fifty\r\noccupants on improved portable camp kitchens. Telephones connected\r\nevery battalion headquarters with its regimental headquarters and so\r\nthroughout the army, every unit with the next largest and all with the\r\ngeneral headquarters at Liao-yang. Great fur overcoats, pure wool\r\nunderclothing, heavy uniforms well adapted for comfort and warmth; in\r\nevery detail the Japanese were splendidly equipped for the ordeal of\r\ncold. Thousands of slight cases of frost-bite reached the hospitals\r\nafter occasional sorties demanded by fitful attacks of Russian scouting\r\nparties, but there was none of this in the normal life of the vast army\r\nof nearly 300,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese medical department during the winter made a wonderful\r\nfight against disease, that bane of armies, and continued under these\r\nunrecord of the actual campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wonderful Sanitary Record]\r\n\r\nUntil now disease has always been much more destructive than shot and\r\nshell. During the brief conflict with Spain 268 Americans died of\r\nbullets and wounds, while mortality from disease reached the appalling\r\nnumber of 3,862, or about fourteen to one. In the Boer War 7,792\r\nEnglish were killed in action or died of wounds, while 13,250 fell\r\nvictims to disease. Of the Turkish army operating in Thessaly seven\r\nyears ago, 1,000 men were lost in battle, while 19,000 died at the\r\nfront of disease. Twenty-two thousand others were invalided home, and\r\nof these 8,000 subsequently died. This was a ratio of twenty-seven men\r\nkilled by disease to one by bullets. Even more frightful was the\r\nexperience of the French expedition to Madagascar in 1894. Only 29 were\r\nkilled in action, while over 7,000 perished from disease. Compare these\r\nfrightful experiences with the record of the Japanese. During the last\r\nnine months of 1904, throughout a difficult campaign, in a country\r\nnoted for lack of sanitation, only forty deaths from disease occurred\r\nin the immense army in Manchuria commanded by General Oku. It is a\r\nwonderful lesson in sanitation Japan has taught to the world.\r\n\r\nWhile disease scored but forty victims in nine months among the\r\nsoldiers of General Oku, no fewer than 5,127 officers and men were\r\nkilled and 21,080 wounded. This shows that the period was one of great\r\nactivity, of hard campaigning and severe fighting--which makes the low\r\ndisease death rate all the more astonishing. Soldiers in the field\r\ncannot be looked after as carefully as those in camp; hygiene and\r\nsanitary surroundings are only temporary, and, therefore, more crude;\r\ndietetic regulations are more difficult to enforce. Of course, there\r\nwere many cases of disease in Oku's army--24,642 in all--but the\r\nmajority were of bronchial troubles, resulting from climatic\r\nconditions. Of beri beri, a malady peculiarly Oriental, 5,070 cases\r\nwere reported. But the progressive Japanese seem to have gotten the\r\nmastery even of this, once notable, because of its mortality. It is,\r\nhowever, in battling with those most dreaded scourges of an\r\narmy--typhoid fever and dysentery--that the Japanese have scored their\r\ngreatest triumphs. Of typhoid fever they have had only 193 cases, and\r\nof dysentery only 342 cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil War Comparisons]\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the American Civil War typhoid fever attacked\r\n8 per cent. of the Federal troops, killing 35 per cent. of the white\r\nand 55 per cent. of the negro soldiers who contracted it. But here is\r\nan army in the wilds of Manchuria larger than that of McClellan before\r\nRichmond, which had only forty deaths in nine months. The great\r\nAmerican conflict was one of the bloodiest in history. In the Federal\r\nranks, 110,070 men were killed in battle or died of wounds, while\r\n249,458 were sent to their graves of disease. Why is it the little\r\nbrown islanders of the East were so successful in fighting the unseen\r\nfoe?\r\n\r\n\"Every death from preventable disease is an insult to the intelligence\r\nof the age,\" says Major Louis L. Seaman, late surgeon in the United\r\nStates Volunteers, who returned from Japan during the war.\r\n\r\n\"When it occurs in an army, where the units are compelled to submit to\r\ndiscipline, it becomes a governmental crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disease bacteria,\" asserts another writer, in discussing the medical\r\naspects of the Boer War, \"are even more dangerous than Mauser bullets\r\nshot off with smokeless powder. Both hit without giving a sign to the\r\neye whence they come, and of the two, the Mausers hit less often and\r\nhit less hard.\" It was through prompt recognition of these propositions\r\nthat the Japanese held down their death rate from disease. Major Seaman\r\nrelates that, in conversation with a Japanese officer early in the\r\nconflict, the subject of Russia's overwhelming numbers was mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" admittted the officer, \"we are prepared for that. Russia may be\r\nable to place 2,000,000 men in the field. We can furnish 500,000. You\r\nknow that in war four men die of disease for every one who falls from\r\nbullets. We propose to eliminate disease as a factor. Every man who\r\ndies in our army must fall on the field of battle. In this way we shall\r\nneutralize the superiority of Russian numbers and stand on a\r\ncomparatively equal footing.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Scientific]\r\n\r\nWhen Japan started out to make war she did so upon a scientific basis.\r\nFor many months in advance the store rooms of Tokio were crowded with\r\nsurgical materials, cots, tents, bedding, ambulances and all kinds of\r\nhospital supplies, ready for any emergency, and under the personal\r\nexample of the Empress the women of the land made bandages for those\r\nwho might be wounded. Japan realized also that the keystone to the\r\nhealth of the army lay in the character of the ration provided for the\r\nindividual soldier. So she set about to master that problem. First of\r\nall, the ration evolved was suited to the climatic conditions of the\r\ncampaign. It consisted largely of rice, compressed fish, soy, army\r\nbiscuits, a few salted plums, tea--all of which necessitate the\r\ndrinking of large quantities of boiled water--a few ounces of meat and\r\nsome juicy, succulent pickles.\r\n\r\nNo more thorough or efficient medical preparation could be imagined\r\nthat Japan made for her great conflict. Not only was the ablest of\r\nmedical counsel obtained, but the members of that staff of the army\r\nwere given rank and full authority to enforce their decrees. The\r\nJapanese had a medical director who ranked as a lieutenant-general. Six\r\nmedical officers ranked as major-general. With every 20,000 men in line\r\na surgeon ranking as brigadier-general, and all have power to enforce\r\ntheir orders. Every body of moving soldiers, however small, was\r\naccompanied by one or more medical officers, who were almost\r\nomnipresent, and were always watchful. Field and line officers and men\r\nwere obliged to obey them without question. The solution of the greater\r\nproblem engaged the attention of the medical corps. This was in\r\npreserving the health and fighting value of the army. Nothing seemed\r\ntoo small to escape the vigilance of the medical officers, or too\r\ntedious to weary his patience. He was with the first line of scouts,\r\nwith his microscope and chemicals, testing and labelling wells so that\r\nthe army to follow should not drink water that was contaminated. When\r\nthe scouts reached a town, he immediately instituted a thorough\r\nexamination of its sanitary condition. If contagious or infectious\r\ndisease was found, he quarantined and placed a guard around the\r\ndangerous district. Notices were posted, so that the approaching column\r\nwas warned and no soldiers were located where danger existed.\r\nViolations of such a notice was as great an offense as disobedience to\r\na line officer on a battlefield. An officer with only the rank of a\r\nlieutenant might post the notice, and yet General Oku himself dared not\r\ndisregard it. No foraging party ever set out to gather supplies unless\r\naccompanied by a medical officer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Detail Overlooked]\r\n\r\nHe sampled the various kinds of food, fruit and vegetables sold by the\r\nnatives along the line of march long before the arrival of the army. If\r\nthe food was tainted, or the fruit over ripe, or the water ought to be\r\nboiled, notice was posted to that effect. In camp, too, the medical\r\nofficer was always busy, lecturing the men on sanitation and the\r\nhundred and one details of personal hygiene--how to cook, to eat, and\r\nwhen not to drink; to bathe, and even to directions as to paring and\r\ncleansing the finger nails to prevent danger from bacteria. More than\r\nany other preventive, the boiling of all drinking water was insisted\r\nupon. Every Japanese soldier carried a small copper camp kettle with a\r\ndouble bottom. By the use of it he was enabled to boil water even in a\r\ngale. Charcoal was burned on the inside, the water being heated between\r\ntwo layers of copper. Great kettles for similar use in camps were also\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nLarge bathing basins, or kettles, formed an important part of the\r\nequipment of each company. They were placed upon the ground and are\r\nready for use in a few minutes after camp was made. In this way\r\npersonal cleanliness was maintained. A troop might encamp beside a\r\nsmall stream, the water of which was needed for several different\r\npurposes. It was not scooped up indiscriminately, but the flow was\r\ndivided into separate channels--one for drinking or cooking, another\r\nfor bathing, a third for laundry service, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wounded Rarely Died]\r\n\r\nUp to July 1, 1106 wounded were taken to Tokio, and of that number not\r\na single man died. These men were shot in almost every possible way;\r\nsix had bullets through the brain, nine had bullets through their\r\nchests, and six had bullets through the abdomen--and yet all got well.\r\nThe medical service of the United States in its war with Spain was not\r\nany more discreditable when compared with that of Japan than the\r\nmedical service of the English Army during its war with the Boers. The\r\nreport of the English Hospital Commission, which inquired into the\r\nmedical end of that conflict, shows that there was \"an immense amount\r\nof needless suffering and misery.\" There is no attempt \"to hide\r\nincompetency and unpreparedness under the platitude that 'was is war.'\"\r\nJust as in the Spanish-American War, a large number of civil surgeons\r\nwere employed for army work in South Africa. They had no knowledge of\r\nmilitary duties nor of military methods and discipline. Consequently,\r\nthey were ineffective, except when accompanied and, to some extent,\r\ncontrolled by officers of the service. They were absolutely without\r\nauthority. Perhaps all these lessons were observed and absorbed by the\r\nkeen-eyed Japanese. In any event, they have given the world the most\r\npronounced examples of scientific warfare that the hoary old globe has\r\never seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE TROOPS CAUGHT IN BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  The Greatest Battle of History--Rout and Disaster for Russia--The\r\n    Ancient City of Mukden--The Tombs of the Manchus--A Flourishing\r\n    Mart--Betwixt Winter and Spring--The Line of Battle--Lone Tree\r\n    Hill--The Russian Position--The Japanese Task--Mukden the Real\r\n    Battleground--Russian Flanks Strongly Protected--Well Protected\r\n    on the East--Battled for Mountain Passes--Russians Had\r\n    Advantage of Position--The Outlook for Oyama--Busy Preparations\r\n    During Winter--Oyama's Plan of Battle--Nogi to Strike\r\n    Culminating Blow--\"Out of the Way for Us\"--Master Stroke of the\r\n    Battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only the climax of the Japan-Russian War, but a climax to all wars\r\nwas reached in the Battle of Mukden, fought February 19-March 13, 1905.\r\nThis memorable struggle, resulting in a sweeping victory for Japan, was\r\npractically a campaign in itself. The results, a cataclasm which\r\noverwhelmed the Russian army, were not merely what had been expected\r\nfor this one battle, but comprehended all that the Japanese had hoped\r\nfor a year's campaign. It was more than rout. It remains a grisly\r\nmonument to the potentiality of war to write horror on the pages of\r\nworld history. It was more than defeat, retreat, disaster, it was\r\npractical annihilation for Russia's power of resistance in the Far\r\nEast. Her vaunted military power was trailed in the dust, was\r\nobliterated. When the smoke of the contest had rolled away Oyama stood\r\nmaster of Manchuria with only a demoralized horde of the enemy \"without\r\nform and void\" fleeing in panic with no thought but to shake off a foe\r\nto whom no resistance could be offered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Greatest Battle of History]\r\n\r\nNo nation in the world's history has faced a greater blow to its\r\nmilitary prestige, and from the standpoint of the Japanese--no military\r\nforce has achieved for its nation a more sweeping or more complete\r\nvictory. The Battle of Mukden is destined to occupy a unique place in\r\nthe story of the nations for these and other reasons. In point of the\r\nterritory involved; in point of the number of men engaged; in point of\r\nthe duration of the struggle; in point of the lessons, the authentic\r\nhistory of the world has no peer for its record.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin, the Russian Commander-in-Chief, had at the\r\nbeginning of the struggle an army of 300,000 infantry; 26,700 cavalry,\r\nand 1,368 guns. This is the estimate of the Japanese intelligence\r\nbureau. On the other hand the German Military Review credited\r\nKuropatkin with a total of 370,790 men of whom 36,790 were cavalry. The\r\nGermans estimate that the Russians had a total of 1,598 field guns, and\r\n72 heavy guns. Somewhere between these two estimates the actual\r\nfigures, carefully concealed by the Russians, may be taken to lie.\r\nMarshal Oyama had 500,000 men of all arms and artillery equal to that\r\nof the Russians with a preponderating number of big guns, a great many\r\nhaving been moved from Port Arthur to the northern battleground. In the\r\ntwo armies therefore, there were in round numbers a total of about\r\n800,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE BATTLE OF MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rout and Disaster for Russia]\r\n\r\nThe battle developed into a struggle for possession of Mukden, the\r\nancient Manchu capital, near which lie the Imperial Tombs of the\r\nfounders of the Manchu dynasty, a spot sacred throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of China. The battle lines around this city stretched for one\r\nhundred miles. The fighting began on February 19. On March 7th the\r\nRussians already seeing disaster in the advance made by the Japanese\r\nunder General Nogi, toward cutting off the line of retreat north of\r\nMukden, fell back from the centre along the Sha-ho River and on March\r\n10 evacuated Mukden, beginning a retreat that was turned into a\r\ndisastrous rout by the desperate flank attacks of the Japanese from\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nThe Russian losses to March 13, when the Battle of Mukden actually came\r\nto a close, were 175,000 men, killed, wounded and prisoners; 60 guns;\r\n25,000 rounds of small arm ammunition and immense quantities of stores.\r\nThe Japanese casualties to March 12 were 41,222 killed, wounded and\r\nmissing and several hundred of the missing were recovered in the\r\ncapture of Mukden. The Japanese sent 43,000 prisoners to Japan as one\r\nof the results of the victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ancient City of Mukden]\r\n\r\nMukden, round which the greatest battle in history raged, is, without\r\nexception, the most interesting place in the whole of Northern China.\r\nIn the eyes of all Manchurians it is the one holy city in the world,\r\nfor it is here that the tombs of the founders of the Manchu dynasty are\r\nsituated. For this reason the Chinese Government demanded that the\r\nsacred precincts of the Imperial Tombs must not be violated by foul\r\nwarfare, and both sides engaged in the horrible work of killing,\r\nentered into solemn undertakings to respect the sanctity of the famous\r\nburial grounds.\r\n\r\nThe great city stands in the middle of a vast alluvial plain,\r\nsurrounded by rich and highly cultivated land. The population of Mukden\r\nis over a quarter of a million, and the city is modelled on a similar\r\nplan to that of Peking, presenting an imposing appearance, in spite of\r\nthe decay into which many of the ancient buildings have been allowed to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThe railway, which runs north to Harbin, does not pass within a mile of\r\nthe city, the Chinese having refused to allow the neighborhood of the\r\nsacred tombs to be desecrated by the construction of an iron road in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. The station is consequently about a mile away\r\nfrom the city, but on alighting from the train, one is immediately\r\nstruck by the sight of the tremendous brick walls, 60 feet high, which\r\nsurround the inner town. This is built in the form of a square a mile\r\nwide, and entrance is gained through eight enormous brick gates,\r\nsurrounded by watch-towers and batteries. Outside this, suburbs extend\r\nfor about a mile in every direction, and the whole is surrounded by a\r\nmud rampart from ten to twenty feet in height.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of the city is the sacred shrine of Na Ta, and a\r\nmile to the east of this is the Temple of Heaven, where sacrifices of\r\nblack cattle and white sheep are offered up in the Emperor's name. To\r\nthe east of this pagoda, buried in the midst of a grove of fir trees,\r\nis the famous tomb of the great Chinese conqueror, Tai Tsung. Access to\r\nthe tomb is gained through a great gateway, roofed with red and yellow\r\ntiles, down a long avenue flanked by colossal stone figures of animals,\r\ngreat marble columns, and stretches of high wall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tombs of the Manchus]\r\n\r\nThe other great tomb lies due east of the city, in the heart of a great\r\nforest. Here, amid similar walls, figures of animals, and decayed\r\nmarble columns, lie the remains of Nao Chu, the father of Tai Tsung.\r\nThe fact that both these sacred relics were surrounded by acres of\r\nforest made it likely that no violation, either by Russians or\r\nJapanese, would take place, though the possible misdirection of a shell\r\nfrom one of their heavy guns might very easily have ruined either of\r\nthem. Such an accident would very probably have stirred the somnolent\r\nChinese to their very depths.\r\n\r\nFor an Eastern city Mukden is extremely clean and well kept. The\r\nManchus are well known for their cleanly habits, which are often in\r\nstriking contrast with those of the southern Chinese. The streets are\r\nwell scavengered, and there are many most imposing, if not beautiful,\r\nprivate mansions belonging to wealthy mandarins. There are also a great\r\nnumber of handsome shops, and the centre of the city is always busy\r\nwith the incessant movement and bustle which are only to be found in\r\nprosperous trading centres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Flourishing Mart]\r\n\r\nFor Mukden is the centre of an enormous trade between the north and the\r\nsouth of China. From the north come enormous quantities of fur, and\r\nfrom the south millions of bushels of all sorts of grain, while in the\r\nimmediate vicinity wheat, barley, tobacco, melons, and cucumbers are\r\ngrown in the fertile plain which stretches away on all sides. The\r\nsilkworm, too, is cultivated all round Mukden, so that there is never\r\nany lack of trade from one source or another, whatever the season.\r\nMukden, in the Manchu language means \"flourishing,\" and for centuries\r\nthe city has lived up to its name.\r\n\r\nTwo miles to the south of the city is a wide, sandy stretch of ground,\r\ntwenty miles long, through which runs the Hun River, which can be\r\nforded almost anywhere. This approach to Mukden, forming the Russian\r\ncenter, was strongly held with sand-bag batteries. On the west of the\r\ntown the very high railway embankment, running north and south of the\r\nriver for many miles, was used to protect Mukden against attack from\r\nthe west. The most vulnerable point in this line was the bridge over\r\nthe Hun River, against which the Japanese delivered incessant attack.\r\nMukden was strongly fortified by General Kuropatkin. The fortifications\r\nextended for nine miles, with forts and redoubts at intervals of a\r\nmile. The redoubts were all cleverly masked, and the line of\r\nfortification was protected by deep ditches and pits, all with stakes\r\nat the bottom, by wire entanglements, land mines, and a line of felled\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Betwixt Winter and Spring]\r\n\r\nWinter still howls over Manchuria when February is drawing to a close,\r\nbut the early days of March, just as through the central United States,\r\nbring the first flush of spring. The ground remains locked in the grip\r\nof a frost that turns earth to steel to a depth of seven feet. The\r\nrivers are still securely ice-bound, but overhead the sun begins a\r\nmastery over the overpowering cold. If the nights remain bitterly cold,\r\nthe days are increasingly warm and throughout the daylight hours\r\nconditions are ideal for the work of the soldier. The weather,\r\ntherefore, fairly trumpeted a call to arms to the two vast armies that\r\nconfronted each other south of the Sha-ho River. The earliest moves\r\nwere made over whitened plains with snow storms still driving over\r\nhills and plain out of the bleak north. Marshal Oyama, the Japanese\r\ncommander, evidently realized that the struggle would be long and,\r\nindeed, before its end winter had, in fact, given place to the opening\r\ndays of spring. The advantages were many. The movement of artillery was\r\nfacilitated by the hard surface of frozen ground and the ease with\r\nwhich ice-covered streams and rivers could be crossed. Lack of foliage\r\ndeprived the army of the protection that so greatly aided the advance\r\non Liao-yang, and so effectively shielded the artillery in that\r\nstruggle. The broken nature of the country, the heavy calibre guns,\r\nfiring from one to five miles with accuracy, minimized the disadvantage\r\nof fighting over a bare land and if lack of protection of foliage and\r\ngrowing crops added to the Japanese losses it failed to check the vigor\r\nor relentlessness of the advance once it had begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Line of Battle]\r\n\r\nThe lines of the two armies on the eve of the great battle, stretched\r\nfrom the Hun River, on the west, in a southeasterly direction south of\r\nthe Sha-ho River, along that stream, then bending more southward,\r\nacross the Taitse River, near Bensihu, at a point thirty-five miles\r\neast of Yentai Station, on the Harbin--Port Arthur Railroad. These\r\nlines had been determined by the battle of the Sha-ho River, October\r\n6-13, the end of the campaign of 1904. Strategically the advantage lay\r\nwith the Russians. Though defeated in the memorable battle along the\r\nSha-ho, General Kuropatkin had secured a position south of Mukden far\r\nsuperior to any below Tie Pass, the gateway to the great plains around\r\nHarbin, always regarded as the ultimate decisive battleground of\r\nManchuria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN RETREAT IN MANCHURIA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lone Tree Hill]\r\n\r\nThe whole lay of the land was adapted to defensive fighting. Along most\r\nof the front lay the Sha-ho River, broad enough and deep enough to\r\ndemand bridging except when frozen over. The culminating event of the\r\nbattle of the Sha-ho had been the recapture by the Russians of Lone\r\nTree Hill, a mile east of the railroad, just south of the Sha-ho, at\r\nthe very centre of the battlefield. From this point the Russians\r\ncommanded a territory five miles in radius. The hill, naturally adapted\r\nfor defense, was strongly fortified to a point nearer impregnability\r\neven, than achieved by any of the boasted fortifications of the\r\nmountains around Port Arthur. Thousands of Japanese were ultimately to\r\nimmolate themselves on the slopes of Lone Tree Hill in vain efforts at\r\nits capture. It still stood invincible when events elsewhere demanded\r\nretreat and its abandonment. Westward the Russian line spread across a\r\nrolling country dotted with Chinese villages. The low, stoned walled\r\ncottages of these clusters of hamlets formed the basis for defenses\r\nwhich were well calculated to offer enormous resistance to troops\r\nadvancing across the wide-stretching flats along the Sha-ho, and the\r\neast bank of the Hun, the only approach for the Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian Position]\r\n\r\nEastward from the Sha-ho the defense line followed the foot hills that\r\nbecome mountains thirty miles east of the Sha-ho. In front flowed a\r\nriver for twenty miles of the distance, and a vast level plain\r\napproached the river from the south, over which the Japanese right\r\nflank must make its advance. The Russian position was enclosed in a\r\nvast triangle with the upper angle between Mukden and Fushan,\r\nnorthward, its base the eighty-mile line from Madyanapu, on the Hun\r\nRiver, to Tsenketchen, thirty-five miles east of Yentai. Mountains\r\nprotected the left flank; the Hun River protected the right flank,\r\nwhile Lone Tree Hill, and the Sha-ho River were chief elements in the\r\nstrength of the centre. All the genius of the Russian commanders was\r\nexerted to find the weak spots in this long line. Artillery of the\r\nheaviest types, ranging through all the grades of siege and field guns,\r\nand the more mobile and most deadly machine guns were scattered with\r\nprodigality across the whole vast front then in receding lines to the\r\napex of the triangle, where were arranged the defenses of Mukden and\r\nFushan. To facilitate communications over the battlefield, two hundred\r\nmiles of light railroad track was laid, and thousands of light cars for\r\nhorse or man propulsion were in constant use carrying munitions,\r\nprovisions, guns or whatever was needed, to depots from which every\r\npart of the battlefield was readily accessible. Telephone and telegraph\r\nwires connected the headquarters, just north of the Sha-ho River, with\r\nevery command along the entire line. Crowning all, an army of 350,000\r\nmen rested on its arms, elbow to elbow, along the front, as bulwarks to\r\nthe flanks, and northward, thronging Mukden and Fushan, the reserves.\r\nThis was the immediate situation on the Russian side that confronted\r\nMarshal Oyama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Task]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese task, however, was more than to defeat the Russian army.\r\nCriticism had followed the victory of Liao-yang because, despite the\r\nawful defeat administered, the battle had been indecisive. The Russian\r\ngeneral had been able to extricate his army and by a masterful retreat,\r\nto realign his forces in a new position with no alternative but to\r\nfollow and prepare to renew the struggle left to the Japanese\r\ncommanders. The Battle of Mukden must be estimated in the light of an\r\neffort to prevent a recurrence of this feat by the Russians. The chief\r\nworld interest centers about the strategy of Marshal Oyama to encircle\r\nhis foe, to cut off his retreat completely and to force the alternative\r\nof annihilation or surrender. The geography of the country, its\r\nstrategical features far afield from the actual Russian positions,\r\ntherefore, become matters of moment which must be understood to permit\r\na comprehensive understanding of the battle and its results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mukden the Real Battleground]\r\n\r\nMarshal Oyama's problem, as has been said, was to envelope the Russian\r\narmies. It was as though the Russian triangle were a bottle into which\r\na cork must be driven. On the neck of the bottle, ten miles apart, are\r\nMukden, on the West, and Fushan, on the east. Between these points the\r\nRussians would be compelled to disgorge in a retreat northward should\r\nthe center be broken and a retreat became necessary. Here, then, was\r\nthe Japanese objective. To take Mukden and Fushan, to drive the forces\r\nthere southward toward the Sha-ho, and to place a force northward to be\r\nthe cork in the bottle, driving back the retreat on the advance of the\r\ncenter, right and left armies, thus surrounding the Russians with a\r\nhoop of men and guns that would make escape or victory impossible. Thus\r\nit is that a battle that centered twenty-five miles southward on the\r\nSha-ho River becomes officially known as the battle of Mukden, for here\r\ncentered the really vital struggle of the whole memorable engagement.\r\nThe Russian line of communication centers at Harbin, where the railroad\r\nwhich pierces Manchuria and the Liao-tung Peninsula to Port Arthur,\r\nbranches southward from the Siberian railroad, the artery through which\r\nflows life from St. Petersburg and European Russia to the Far Eastern\r\narmies. The whole Manchurian campaign has moved northward along this\r\nrailroad, the salvation of the Russian army always depending on its\r\nability to keep open at its rear this means of sustenance, of\r\nammunition supply, of reinforcement supply, of transport of every kind,\r\nwhether advancing or retreating. The railroad reached the actual\r\nRussian lines just west of Mukden and then continued southward to the\r\nSha-ho, branching here and there to various field depots convenient to\r\nthe various army units. Marshal Oyama's plan of battle comprehended, as\r\nits greatest achievement, the cutting of this railroad north of Mukden\r\nbefore a retreat could be made. This was the first and most vital\r\ncontribution if the ultimate plan to envelop the Russians was to\r\nsucceed. This plan failed and hence the prize of decisive, final\r\nvictory slipped from the grasp of the Japanese commander, however great\r\nthe blow he dealt to the Russian army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Flanks Strongly Protected]\r\n\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin was fully alive to the dangers on his flanks as well\r\nas at the front. His right flank rested on Mukden, but the actual lines\r\nto which were given the task of preventing the turning of the right\r\nflank were far afield from the actual city. To the southwest they\r\nextended to the Hun River, thirty-five miles away, while the far\r\noutpost was within touch of Sinmintin, a Chinese city, thirty-five\r\nmiles westward of Mukden on the banks of the Liao River. Sinmintin is\r\nactually in the territory which was excluded from the theatre of war by\r\nthe famous agreement proposed to the European Powers by John Hay, the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State, by which the neutrality of Chinese\r\nterritory was assured. Nevertheless, while not actually occupied by the\r\nRussians, Sinmintin was to all intents and purposes within their lines\r\nand was continually used as a receiving point for supplies bought or\r\ncommanded in the Mongolian provinces. Cossacks in large force remained\r\nin close touch with the city while the road leading from Sinmintin to\r\nMukden, a famous caravan route, was occupied by large forces of\r\nRussians and was regarded as an effective bulwark for the Russian right\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nThe Russian defences on the right, or west wing of their army began\r\njust west of the Sha-ho River, extended thence westward for thirty-five\r\nmiles to the Hun and then bent due northward across the left side of\r\nthe Liao River Valley to a point a few miles east of Sinmintin; thence\r\nalong the Sinmintin-Mukden road to Tatchekiao, five miles northward of\r\nMukden; thence due westward until the line intercepted the railroad, a\r\nfew miles north of Mukden. Lieutenant General Baron Kaulbars was\r\ncommander of the army of nearly 100,000 men which made up this wing of\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin's forces. The left wing's divisional commander was\r\nGeneral Linevitch, who, with General Rennenkampf, stands among the\r\ngreatest of the Russian commanders. Occupying a position to the Russian\r\nleft flank exactly similar to that of Mukden on the right, is Fushan,\r\nten miles east of Mukden. With this position firmly held at center and\r\non its flanks it would be impossible for the Japanese to drive in their\r\ncork in the neck of the bottle between Fushan and Mukden. To the\r\naverage strategist, indeed, universally among strategists, the view\r\nwould prevail after a glance of the battlefield as it lay at the\r\nopening of the struggle that there was the real vital point to the\r\nattack as well as to the defense. In the opening days of the battle\r\nevents all shaped themselves to bear out this view. General Kuropatkin\r\nmanifestly thought so. Here he threw the weight of vast numbers of\r\ntroops and thought victory near when the Japanese attack from this\r\nquarter had been fought to a standstill. Logically, Fushan was the\r\nchief danger point, and the fact that Marshal Oyama, the Japanese\r\ncommander, chose another strategical solution for the problem is among\r\nhis achievements that have resulted in the appellation of \"The Napoleon\r\nof the Orient.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Well Protected on the East]\r\n\r\nJust as on the west, the Russian lines were far afield from the actual\r\nkey position at Mukden, so on their left, or eastern positions their\r\nlines formed a far-reaching protective barrier, 20 miles away. As has\r\nbeen said, the main front on the east stretched away from the Sha-ho,\r\nthirty-five miles eastward to the Taitse River, which winds in a\r\ngeneral northeasterly direction from Liao-yang. The defensive position\r\nof importance was at Tsinketchen, in the foothills of the Sierras,\r\nwhich run across Manchuria, and finally reach the east coast of Korea.\r\n\r\nThe only practicable path northward for the Japanese army was to skirt\r\nthese foothills to the passes, northeast from Tsinketchen and\r\nBentsiaputze and then debouch into the valley of the Hun River and\r\nfight their way northward to Fushan, the rugged nature of the country\r\neastward from that place practically preventing any opportunity for\r\nplay of strategy in a turning movement to strike northeast of the city.\r\nOne of the wonders of the war and one of the most amazing of the feats\r\nconstantly accomplished by the Japanese has been the skill and success\r\nwith which they have attacked and captured mountain positions. General\r\nKuroki in the campaign which, after a few months followed the victory\r\nof the Yalu, repeatedly drove the Russians from veritable Thermopylæs\r\nand in the fighting on every front which preceded the surrounding of\r\nthe Russian army at Liao-yang the Japanese were constantly confronted\r\nwith the necessity of making frontal attacks on mountain defiles which\r\nseemed to offer impregnable shelter to the defenders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battled for Mountain Passes]\r\n\r\nSo also in the campaign on the east in the battle of Mukden. General\r\nKuropatkin chose his defensive positions with skill. No pains were\r\nspared in fortifying the gaps in the mountain ridges through which the\r\nJapanese must pass. The principal routes open were through Da Pass and\r\nGauto Pass. While these were the main defensive positions the Russians\r\npushed fifteen miles further southward toward the enemy, and the\r\nearlier reverses at Tsinketchen were only fairly unimportant preludes\r\nto the battling at these mountain passes. The Russian line on the east\r\nhad less geometrical regularity than the line of the west owing to the\r\nnature of the topography. The lines from the front extended to the\r\nfoothills, as has been pointed out, and then were concentrated at the\r\npasses, the danger points, offering only a limited battle line until\r\nthe fighting had swept over the mountains into the Valley of the Hun.\r\nWhat with artillery of a thousand guns and an army of 75,000 men only\r\ncalled upon to defend positions of vast natural strength, there was\r\nlittle wonder then when the open guns of the battle rolled over the\r\nplains in the west, General Kuropatkin concentrated his attention to\r\nthe centre and gave little thought to events on his left. As it turned\r\nout the General's confidence was well founded. In all the war no braver\r\nor more stubborn or more successful fight has been waged by any Russian\r\nforce than was waged by the army under Lieutenant-General Linevitch and\r\nGeneral Rennenkampff on this flank. It has been said that the Japanese\r\nwere fought to a standstill. That statement is literally true, and only\r\nthe beginning of the Russian retreat made it possible for General\r\nKuroki, the Japanese Commander here, to play any conspicuous part in\r\nthe total disaster which befell the Russian Army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians Had Advantage of Position]\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the position in which General Kuropatkin found himself at\r\nthe opening of the battle was an admirable one from every standpoint.\r\nHis defensive lines fitted in well with the topography of the country.\r\nBroad rivers, rugged mountains, apparently impregnable mountain passes,\r\ncommanding hills on front and flanks promised to aid materially in his\r\ndefence. His army was nearly of equal strength with that of the enemy,\r\nwhile superior natural positions compensated for the slight deficiency\r\nof men. In the long winter months every possible means of communication\r\nfrom one to another of the units of his army had been perfected, while,\r\napparently unassailable, stretched a great railroad behind him offering\r\nready link between the front and the Russian base of supplies for all\r\nof Manchuria. His army had been recuperated, was eager to fight, and\r\nwould be called upon to defend fortified positions, heavily supplied\r\nwith artillery, a position which, as history plainly proves, brings out\r\nthe best qualities of the Russian soldier. So far as the centre was\r\nconcerned he had no fear. Lone Tree Hill, or, as he renamed it for the\r\nRussian who led the charge that had recaptured it from the Japanese,\r\nhad been made as nearly impregnable as men and arms could make a\r\nposition made by nature for defensive fighting. So westward, so\r\neastward, topography, the condition of his army, the whole aspect of\r\nthe field, spoke only of a repulse to the Japanese attack. Then would\r\ncome the offensive against a worn-out army, then the victory for which\r\nall Russia was clamoring and upon which depended the future of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief himself.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Russian viewpoint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN SUFFERING AT THE BATTLE OF MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Outlook for Oyama]\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke of the battle of the Sha-ho cleared away it left the\r\nJapanese armies masters of practically the same territory they had\r\noccupied at the conclusion of the pursuit of the Russian after the\r\nvictory at Liao-yang. General Kuroki, commanding the Japanese right\r\narmy, had fallen back from Bentsiaputze to Bensihu, a distance of\r\ntwenty miles; but this move had been made to correct the alignment of\r\nthe army with the centre, at the Sha-ho River as a basis. Certainly, no\r\ngreat effort was made to advance this force after the initial Russian\r\nsuccesses on this flank after the battle of the Sha-ho. Some advantages\r\nattached to the position finally occupied by General Kuroki, hence the\r\nview that he was impelled by strategic reasons when he had failed to\r\nadvance, rather than by inability to retake the lost positions farther\r\nnorth. At the centre, which followed the south bank of the Sha-ho\r\nRiver, the Russians had succeeded in retaking Lone Tree Hill in the\r\nclosing hours of the battle, and had a decided advantage. Every\r\npossible effort was made to retake the position, but when called upon\r\nfor this effort the Japanese were exhausted by twelve days of incessant\r\nfighting, and they failed. Marshal Oyama, at the centre, therefore, was\r\nconfronted by a practically impregnable position. Westward, on the left\r\nflank of the Japanese Army, the Russians were less aided by natural\r\nfeatures of the country than at any other point. Their lines crossed\r\nthe Sha-ho just west of the railroad and then spread northeastward\r\nthrough a series of villages dotting a comparatively level plain lying\r\nbetween the Sha-ho and the Hun Rivers. Of all the positions on the\r\nentire Russian front this seemed to offer the best opportunity for\r\nattack, for while an advance would have to be made over an open\r\ncountry, approach to the Russians' positions was facilitated by the\r\ninnumerable villages in this fertile river plain. On the other hand,\r\nthe Japanese were open to the same style of advance, and both\r\ncommanders made unusual preparations to defend this angle of the great\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese lines along the front were merely a parallel of the\r\nRussian lines which have been described, except that while on the west\r\nand on the centre the entrenchments were only a few hundred yards\r\nseparated, the lines farther east, except for outpost positions, were\r\nseparated by distances ranging from five to fifteen miles, as developed\r\nwhen the operations of the Battle of Mukden were actually under way.\r\n\r\nTo the Japanese Commander-in-Chief the general situation could not have\r\nbeen particularly reassuring, except that he could count on the\r\nindomitable efforts of an unbeaten and fanatically brave army. So far\r\nas the topography was concerned, the enemy had every advantage. In all\r\na very difficult and interesting problem was presented as the Mikado's\r\nhosts settled down for their long winter inaction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Busy Preparations During Winter]\r\n\r\nLiao-yang was made the Japanese base after the occupation of that city,\r\nand the Engineer Corps performed a notable feat in the speedy manner in\r\nwhich the railroad running northward from Port Arthur was made over for\r\nthe use of Japanese engines and cars. The Russians had a five-foot\r\ngauge, while the Japanese rolling stock was built to the standard\r\nmeasurement. This fact made necessary the relaying of the entire line,\r\na task which was promptly completed, thereby affording the inland army\r\nbase ready communication with the general supply base at Dalny and at\r\nPort Arthur after the capture of that port. In addition to this line of\r\ncommunication the Japanese had a line to the Yalu. Stores for the right\r\narmy were landed at the mouth of the Yalu River, and then were\r\ntransported overland on a light railroad for which horses were the\r\nmotive power, to points well in reach of General Kuroki. Both of these\r\nlines of communication were vital to an army that had now penetrated\r\ntwo hundred miles inland and were the first consideration when the\r\nflanks and protective units were being placed in their winter quarters.\r\nThe Liao-yang-Yalu line proved to have been safeguarded against danger,\r\nbut Cossack raiders in January twice encircled the Japanese left army,\r\npenetrated to the railroad at Yinkow, and damaged the line. In each\r\ncase the damage done was quickly repaired. The second raiding party was\r\nso nearly cut off and so nearly annihilated in its flight to the\r\nRussian lines and activities on a broader scale so soon after were\r\nbegun, that no further attempts of the kind were attempted. Such\r\ntrifling inconvenience resulted from these perilous raids that it would\r\nseem that the Russians were hardly recompensed for the sacrifice of\r\nlife. Certainly, the vast bulk of all needed stores and ammunition were\r\nalready within the Japanese lines before the attempts were made, and\r\nMarshal Oyama, in all probability, could have fought the entire battle\r\nof Mukden without further need of the railroad, particularly as no\r\nJapanese retreat resulted from that struggle. The incidents only bore\r\nout the long held reputation of the Cossacks for reckless bravery.\r\nIndeed, the Japanese have repeatedly expressed their admiration for the\r\nCossacks as a foe worthy of their steel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deciding the Way to Strike]\r\n\r\nWith his front well aligned, and with every possible precaution taken\r\nto safeguard his lines of communication, the question then before the\r\nJapanese Commander-in-Chief was the strategy to mark a resumption of\r\nhostilities. At Liao-yang, despite the sweeping nature of the victory,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the Japanese were bitterly disappointed\r\nwhen, despite tremendously determined efforts to prevent their escape,\r\npractically the whole Russian Army had disentangled itself from a\r\nwell-set net and had escaped to occupy new positions there to be fought\r\nall over again. The first thought in all of the planning of the new\r\ncampaign that was to succeed the winter of inactivity, was to\r\naccomplish the actual envelopment of General Kuropatkin, forcing upon\r\nthe Russian Commander a surrender as the only alternative to\r\nannihilation. The line of action decided upon is fully revealed in the\r\ndetails of the battle to be told later. This program of complete\r\ndestruction stands out even more plainly than at Liao-yang. It came far\r\nnearer realization than in that struggle, and was not concluded with\r\nthe mere taking of Mukden; but like the tentacles of a great octopus,\r\nMarshal Oyama's grim determination for complete annihilation of the foe\r\nspread far northward beyond the scene of the initial victory and\r\nrelentlessly realized in large measure all that he had hoped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oyama's Plan of Battle]\r\n\r\nIn brief, the plan was to hold the Russian centre in a combat which,\r\nhowever desperate and bloody, was only a feint. While this struggle\r\nwent on with apparent success to Russian arms, the right and left\r\nflanks as aligned east and west of the Sha-ho were to press home an\r\nattack calculated slowly to bend back the Russians toward their line of\r\nretreat northward from Mukden.\r\n\r\nBut the culminating fact in the entire plan was an entirely separate\r\nblow at the Russian rear north of Mukden by an army which, while it no\r\ndoubt figured in the Russian calculations of probabilities, eventually\r\nburst into the plain eastward from Sinmintin with a fury of surprise\r\nattack which ultimately crumbled the entire scheme of Russian defence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nogi to Strike Culminating Blow]\r\n\r\nThat army was made up of the conquerors of Port Arthur. The fall of\r\nthat fortress released a host of 80,000 seasoned fighters, flushed with\r\na victory that filled the world with awe and admiration. Just so soon\r\nas the details of the surrender had been completed this force was under\r\nway northward to reinforce Marshal Oyama. At its head was the savagely\r\nbrave Nogi, who had just won for himself undying place in the history\r\nof Japan by successfully reducing the Gibraltar of the Orient. Swift\r\nfrom the scene of one great triumph he was speeding to another. It was\r\nin the disposition of this force that all of the genius of Oyama was\r\nexpended. When he sent Nogi westward in a wide circuit to swing\r\ncompletely around the Russian right army, to plunge northward by forced\r\nmarches as far as Simintin and then bend eastward to burst upon the\r\nRussian rear, sweeping within five miles of their lines before an\r\nadequate defence could be provided, he settled the fate of Russia's\r\ngreat army of nearly a half million men. He struck a blow that made an\r\nawful rout possible, and the blow that made possible the final\r\ndisaster, the forced abandonment of Tie Pass, that left the Russian\r\nArmy a demoralized horde of panicked troops facing northward into the\r\nbleak stretches of Northern Manchuria.\r\n\r\nBy this blow he added the final humiliation to Russia's greatest\r\nsoldier, Kuropatkin, and lost that erstwhile leader with half of a\r\ncentury of popular adulation behind him, the command of Russia's Armies\r\nin Manchuria. He ended every hope of an offensive campaign in\r\nManchuria, achieving at a stroke every result that for which a year's\r\ncampaign had been allotted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Out of the Way for Us\"]\r\n\r\nNogi's army swept into the ranks of the opposing Russians, shouting,\r\n\"Out of the way for us; we're from Port Arthur\". To them fighting in\r\nthe open country face to face with the enemy was as child's play\r\ncompared with the horrors they had faced in scaling the bristling\r\nmountainsides north of Port Arthur. There they advanced against hidden\r\nterrors that lurked behind dull gray walls of huge forts; they braved\r\nthe cunningly devised high priests of death that are hidden underground\r\nand work havoc and disaster when victory seems within grasp. They had\r\nlooked death in the face in a hundred hidden forms unflinchingly, had\r\nfought and conquered a foe behind vast walls. Here there was only man\r\nto man. Shells burst overhead, scattering deadly shrapnel, but what was\r\nthat to the rain of ponderous steel from siege guns that tore out the\r\nface of hillsides and annihilated regiments at a single puff. These\r\nwere the men who, with a strident battle cry of scorn for the ease of\r\nthe task, swept through thirty miles in a single day, trampling Russian\r\nregiments under foot, storming over fortified towns as though no men or\r\nguns were there, right up to the gates of Mukden, right where their\r\nguns could search the huddled ranks of Russians, fleeing from the\r\ndestructible force that was welding a ring around them. Nature finally\r\nchecked them. Up from the Manchurian plains a mighty wind swept a\r\nblinding simoon that halted their irresistible host at the moment when\r\nthey were driving home the last fatal blow. For a day the whole\r\nbattlefield was wrapped in a blinding curtain of sweeping sand. When\r\nonce again Nogi's men could take up the work they had begun the bulk of\r\nthe Russian force had fled past. Undaunted they swept northward, and\r\nfour days later, when the beaten and dispersed army was reorganizing\r\nits ranks from the chaos of the flight, it was Nogi's men, springing\r\nonce more out of the west, that set Kuropatkin's whole remnant in\r\nflight again, leaving behind them the last fortified position in\r\nSouthern Manchuria. Oyama planned, but the palm for the victories of\r\nMukden and the further flight from Tie Pass belongs to Nogi and the\r\nhost that took Port Arthur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Master Stroke of the Battle]\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the master stroke of the battle, nevertheless a way had\r\nto be prepared for it by tremendously desperate work on every quarter\r\nof the long battle line. As vigorous as was the assault made on the\r\nRussian front, there can be no doubt that this was nothing more than a\r\nfeint. The readiness with which the Japanese Commander-in-Chief\r\nsacrificed thousands of lives in assaults of a secondary nature is one\r\nof the significant things of the story of the battle. Such methods are\r\nreminiscent of Grant's massed attacks in the closing days of the Civil\r\nWar, when life was counted as nothing when in the scale beside the\r\nvalue of victory. No pang for the sacrifice reached the heart of Oyama\r\nor the Generals under him who were directing the assaults. Victory was\r\nthe stake, and the soldiers were there to die, if need be. They died by\r\nfiles and ranks and regiments. But victory was won. Over against the\r\ntotal of the blood-letting in their own ranks was the awful slaughter\r\nof the enemy, here, as in every battle of the war, far heavier in the\r\nRussian totals than with the Japanese. Two generations have come since\r\nthe famous struggle of Gettysburg, yet statisticians are still\r\nstruggling to determine the exact number who fought and died there or\r\nwho remained alive, as victor and vanquished. The actual figures are\r\nstill only approximately known. Multiply the difficulties of accounting\r\nfor the less than two hundred thousand who fought at Gettysburg an\r\nhundredfold, and something of the difficulty of getting at the actual\r\nfacts of the battle at Mukden begin to be realized. Ultimately, the\r\nJapanese may give the details, but no actual statement of the number of\r\nRussians engaged, of the losses in killed, wounded and missing, may be\r\nexpected. The story forms too tragic a page in the history of the\r\nnation ever to be willingly spread broadcast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON BOARD A JAPANESE BATTLESHIP DURING THE BATTLE OF THE\r\nJAPAN SEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  Prelude to the Great Battle--Gripenberg Fails and Quits Army--The\r\n    Battle Begins--The Struggle on the East Front--The Battle at\r\n    the Center--Battle Culminates on the West--Village by Village\r\n    Taken--Russian Artillery Impotent--When the Crushing Blow\r\n    Fell--A Cloud in the West--Kuropatkin Ignores Danger--Center\r\n    Positions Abandoned--Japanese Ingenuity Marvelous--Retreat a\r\n    Carnival of Slaughter--Oyama's Prophecy Fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prelude to the Great Battle]\r\n\r\nThere was a prelude to the actual battle fought early in January by a\r\nportion of the Russian right flank under General Gripenberg, which is\r\nchiefly interesting for its effect in the Russian ranks. Whatever may\r\nhave been the purpose of the attack, it failed. Heiketau, a town in the\r\nangle of the Hun and Liao Rivers, was the scene of the opening attack.\r\nHere the Japanese had an outpost in sight of the Russian lines.\r\nResistance was made to the advance until it was seen that the Russians\r\nwere in earnest and that a large force was actually about to give\r\nbattle. Thereupon the Japanese outpost fell back on the main position\r\nat Sandiapu, three miles away, the Russians following. For two days a\r\nsevere fight waged around their position, and General Gripenberg made\r\nenough gains on the first day to give rise to the belief that he was in\r\nposition to break the entire Japanese line, divide their army, flank\r\nthe centre, and compel a retreat. He sent an urgent representation of\r\nthe situation to General Kuropatkin, asking for reinforcements, and,\r\ntaking for granted that these would be sent, he plunged in on the\r\nsecond day to win, at last, a victory for Russia. The force against\r\nwhich he had thrown three divisions consisted of a single division of\r\nthe Japanese, who counted on stopping the advance by dint of the\r\nearthworks protecting Sandiapu. Before morning of the second day\r\nGeneral Oku, exhibiting the rare initiative and resourcefulness common\r\nto all of the Japanese generals, was ready to deal a crushing blow to\r\nGripenberg, and the Russian General in his eagerness to take advantage\r\nof the opportunity which he believed had been opened by the apparent\r\nadvantages of the first day of the fight, fell into one of the most\r\ndeadly of the many traps from time to time set for Russian commanders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gripenberg Fails and Quits Army]\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the Russians would not fail to renew the attack,\r\nGeneral Oku caused a decoy battery of useless guns to sweep into\r\nposition in full view of the Russian lookouts. The bait was too\r\ntempting. Gripenberg advanced on the dummy battery into a triangle of\r\ndeath. Batteries on three sides held their fire until the Russian lines\r\nhad swept into practically point blank range. Then there burst over\r\nthem a rain of shrapnel and a deadly sweep of rifle fire which spread\r\nconfusion as hundreds were mowed down. Retreat from the death zone\r\nbecame rout, and General Gripenberg, with Oku's men in full pursuit,\r\nleft ten thousand dead and wounded behind him in their flight to safety\r\nwithin the main Russian lines north of the Sha-ho. The fight was\r\nunimportant in itself, but it led to a personal encounter between\r\nGenerals Kuropatkin and Gripenberg, which added to the demoralization\r\nalready existing among the officers of the Russian Army. General\r\nGripenberg bitterly assailed Kuropatkin for having failed to send\r\nreinforcements. Kuropatkin declared the only possible value of attack\r\nat that time and place was to uncover the strength of the enemy and to\r\nreconnoitre his positions, that a general engagement was folly and\r\ncould not hope to achieve anything. For be it known, the initial\r\nadvance had been made in a driving blizzard. General Gripenberg gave up\r\nhis command and left the front for St. Petersburg to lay charges of\r\nincapability against the Commander-in-Chief and to join the group at\r\nthe Russian Capital engaged in intrigue for the downfall of Kuropatkin.\r\n\r\nIn the army the line and staff officers took sides in the bitter\r\ncontroversy that followed, and possibly the fight at Sandiapu, itself\r\nso insignificant, did more in the end to bring the disaster of Mukden\r\nand Tie Pass than can be estimated. A commander-in-chief, without the\r\nconfidence of the officers of staff and line, can hardly hope to\r\ncommand the confidence of the men in the ranks. To say the least, the\r\nincident, coming so soon before the army was to be locked in a life and\r\ndeath struggle, was not calculated to add to the chances that victory\r\nwould crown Russian arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle Begins]\r\n\r\nThe battle was actually begun on the initiative of the Japanese. By\r\nFebruary 19, Marshal Oyama believed he was ready to begin the struggle\r\nfor Mukden. He prefaced the battle by the prophecy that Mukden would be\r\noccupied by his army on March 10, a prophecy which caused only\r\nmerriment in Russia, but which was literally fulfilled. To General\r\nKuroki was given the honor of firing the first guns of the renewal of\r\nthe campaign. General Kuroki, after the battle of the Sha-ho River, had\r\nwintered on the southern bank of the Taitze River, the centre of his\r\narmy resting in the neighborhood of Bensihu, thirty-five miles east of\r\nYentai. The Russian line was ten miles north, and the first place to be\r\ntaken was Tsinkhetchen, at a point where the level river country began\r\nto rise to the Tie range of mountains, running in a generally\r\nnorthwest-southeast direction across all of Manchuria, into Mongolia\r\nnorthward, and into Korea southward, passing along the eastern side of\r\nthe Russian triangle. The task assigned to Kuroki was to drive the\r\nRussians from Tsinkhetchen into the foothills to the passes of the\r\nmountains, then to take these and to debouch his army on the plains of\r\nthe Hun River, twenty miles east of Mukden, and eastward of Fushun,\r\nthen to strike northwestward toward the railroad and line of retreat of\r\nthe Russian Army northward from Mukden, joining at the railroad the\r\nforces under Oku and Nogi, which were to attack from the west.\r\n\r\nKuroki's army got under way February 19, crossing the first of the\r\nrivers, the Taitse, without opposition. Then the advance was made\r\nnorthward to the Sha-ho, and here the Russian lines were encountered. A\r\nsurprise night attack cleared away the Russians guarding the Sha-ho at\r\nVanupudza, ten miles east of the railroad. Kuroki then bent\r\nnortheastward toward the outermost position of the Russian left,\r\navoiding the forces commanding the hills north of the Sha-ho.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Struggle on the East Front]\r\n\r\nOn February 24 his army delivered a tremendous assault on the Russian\r\npositions at Tsinkhetchen, preceding the infantry advance by a\r\nbombardment of great force and effectiveness. Three lines of\r\nentrenchments were literally destroyed by the fire of siege guns which\r\nhad been brought from Port Arthur, and despite the tremendous\r\ndifficulty involved had been placed within range of the Tsinkhetchen\r\npositions. The Russian defence was stubborn, but the Japanese were\r\nirresistible, and after a few hours of awful carnage General\r\nRennenkampff, commanding the Russians, ordered a retreat. Kuroki failed\r\nin an effort to envelop the position, and the Russians reached in\r\nsafety their main position on this flank at Da Pass. Here one of the\r\nbloodiest struggles of the war followed, opening on February 28 and\r\ncontinuing until March 1, when, despite one of the most gallant\r\nresistances credited to the Russians, General Kuroki flanked the Pass\r\nnotwithstanding insuperable obstacles offered by the rugged nature of\r\nthe country. Then followed a retreat and pursuit, every step of which\r\nwas marked by fighting of the most desperate nature, thousands of\r\nbodies carpeting the gradually rolling country, which finally became\r\nthe plains along the Hun. Fushun was the Japanese objective. Kuroki\r\nbent every energy to roll back the front which Rennenkampff presented,\r\nbut for ten days after the plain had been reached his army was fought\r\nto a standstill. General Linevitch, commanding the division of which\r\nRennenkampff's command was part, checkmated every attempt made to cross\r\nthe Hun and flank him, while at his front he rolled back as many as\r\nthirteen infantry assaults in a single day. This section of the field\r\nwas remote from the main battle line and few of the details reached the\r\nworld. With the slow filtering of the story of this fighting it has\r\nbecome apparent that here was waged a struggle even more desperate than\r\nthat which made history west of Mukden. Kuropatkin appreciated the\r\nvital necessity of preventing the turning of his left flank at Fushun,\r\nand it must be said to the credit of the Japanese that they were\r\nfighting here a force twice the size of their own and one that was\r\ncontinually being reinforced by every battalion that could be spared\r\nfrom the west. The marvel is that Kuroki's army was not utterly\r\nannihilated. It was the tremendous fight he made that compelled\r\nKuropatkin to weaken his right to support Linevitch, and it was the\r\nfact that the right had been so weakened that made possible the\r\nbrilliant victories won by the Japanese on the west. Hence, in addition\r\nto credit for the great fight he made in carrying out his own share in\r\nthe battle, Kuroki stands for credit in drawing strength from other\r\npositions which materially aided in the ultimate outcome. Nevertheless,\r\nuntil fateful March 10, his army had been fought to a standstill within\r\nfive miles of Fushun, its objective. The outcome here even encouraged\r\nKuropatkin in the belief that the battle was going his way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle at the Center]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in recording the story of the battle, to leave Kuroki,\r\nstill fighting in vain to take Fushun and open the road to the Russian\r\nrear, and to record events on other parts of the field. The battle\r\nline, when both armies had actually been joined, extended for a\r\ndistance between eighty and one hundred miles. Every event at every\r\nposition dovetailed into the whole strategy of the battle, yet a vast\r\ndifficulty is imposed in collating all of the scattered events into a\r\ncontinuous story. No one observer, possibly not the Generals-in-chief\r\nthemselves, could follow all of the swift moving events, and the best\r\nand at that a most difficult achievement was to follow the main trend\r\nof events interpreting separate achievements, advances, retrogressions,\r\nas they bore on the grand object of each army.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Mukden was, in fact, four battles in one. One of those\r\nbattles was fought between Kuroki and Linevitch on the east. The second\r\nbattle within the battle of Mukden was fought between the centre armies\r\nand focussed in the beginning of the conflict at Lone Tree, or Putiloff\r\nHill, just east of the railroad, forty-five miles south of Mukden. Here\r\nGeneral Nodzu commanded the Japanese and General Kuropatkin in person\r\nand General Zassulitch, divisional commander, directed the Russian\r\ndefence. The battle here began on February 24, the date on which\r\nGeneral Kuroki delivered the attack on Tsinkhetchen. General Nodzu's\r\nimmediate task was to keep the Russian centre too well occupied and in\r\nfear of a general assault, thus preventing the sending of\r\nreinforcements to the flank, where Kuroki was at his important work.\r\nThe artillery duel which waged around the centre positions has never\r\nbeen equalled in the history of war. The Russians had at this point\r\nalone 530 guns, fifty of them siege guns on permanent emplacements\r\nfiring eight-inch shells. Putiloff and Novgorod Hill bristled with\r\nfield and machine guns, and these commanding hills were flanked east\r\nand west by fortifications upon which five months' work had been\r\nexpended and which are perhaps the finest defensive works ever erected\r\non a battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe Russian centre was the hope of the Russian Commander. He claimed\r\nimpregnability for it, and impregnable it proved. Nevertheless Nodzu\r\nsent scores of assaults at its steep slopes, and the later advances\r\nwere made by the Japanese over the bodies of comrades who had fallen in\r\nearlier efforts. The Russian centre resisted without a break, and only\r\nleft its positions March 7, when events elsewhere resulted in the order\r\nto fall back north of the Sha-ho. The story of the struggle here is an\r\nexact replica of many which waged in the bloody days of the siege of\r\nPort Arthur, though here the loss of life was heavier, since none of\r\nthe protective engineering devices used at Port Arthur were resorted\r\nto. The assaults were simply dashes by Japanese infantry up the bare\r\nslopes of a hill rising five hundred feet in the air. It was man\r\nunprotected against steel in armor, and the man lost. Behind the\r\nRussians was the Sha-ho River. Their second line of defences was sunk\r\nin the hillsides and hilltops there. With the river in front, the ice\r\nweakened until it was questionable whether men in any numbers could\r\nmake safe crossing, this position was only a little less strong than\r\nthe first. All in all, it is little wonder that the Japanese Commander\r\nelected only to feint here and deal his blow at other positions. The\r\nsecond line, however, availed the Russians little except to hold in\r\ncheck the pursuit and leave General Nodzu to be only a minor factor in\r\nthe culmination of the disaster that finally befell the Russians. The\r\ncentre army, while it played no conspicuous part in the battle, while\r\nit was not called upon to repel, and was not expected to take the\r\nRussian positions as a vital part of the Japanese strategy, possibly\r\neven greater credit belongs to these men who died in droves, knowing\r\nthat they were being sacrificed as a matter of secondary importance,\r\nthat upon others elsewhere, miles and miles away, was falling the\r\nreally great events and upon whom would fall the glory. Whether they\r\nknew it or not, there was no faltering. With cries of \"banzai\" they\r\nstormed up Putiloff Hill, up Novgorod Hill; by regiments they fell, and\r\nregiments as loyal and heroic took their places, apparently satisfied\r\nthat all the sacrifice was only to prevent reinforcements from the\r\ncentre from being sent to the lines northeast, northwest, where their\r\nbrothers were writing victory in blood across Manchuria's plains. War\r\nis essentially waste; waste of men, waste of money. Here the spirit of\r\nwaste was fully exemplified, yet the waste was a factor if victory was\r\nto be won, and Oyama sent his armies to their work bent on victory as\r\nperhaps never an army was bent on victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUSSIAN FLEET IN THE BATTLE OF THE JAPAN SEA.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle Culminates on West]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Mukden, as the whole struggle has been officially called,\r\nhad its climax on the west. The strategy of Marshal Oyama, as has been\r\nexplained, culminated in the attack by the army of Port Arthur\r\nveterans, commanded by General Nogi. This attack was but part of the\r\nassault on the Russian right. The actual Japanese left army was\r\ncommanded by General Oku, and during the long winter season had\r\noccupied a position extending westward from the Sha-ho River to the\r\nHun, upon which at the front the Russian right rested, though when the\r\nbattle had gotten under way this line was extended fifteen miles\r\nfarther west to the banks of the Liao River. General Oku's lines and\r\nalso the Russian lines, which he opposed, occupied a series of unmapped\r\nvillages, most of them only occupied during the spring, summer and\r\nfall, when the fertile river valleys are in cultivation, the products\r\nof the region being similar to those of the Northern Central United\r\nStates, east and west from Chicago as a centre. The village huts are\r\nbuilt of rough hewn stone, the walls being of primitive build and\r\noftentimes twelve inches thick. Stone walls around fields are of common\r\noccurrence, so that while the country generally was level, it had in\r\nthese houses and walls many features offering protection to soldiery.\r\nTo-day not a wall or fence in the whole region but shows the signs of\r\nthe struggle that waged around them. Immediately after the battle heaps\r\nof dead marked every one of these shelters, showing where hand to hand\r\nstruggles had taken place, as the Japanese, foot by foot, from house to\r\nhouse, from wall to wall, from village to village, had advanced across\r\nthe plain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Oku's attack was ferocious. To him had been assigned the task\r\nof turning the Russian right back upon Mukden at the centre to make it\r\nimpossible for this force to assume an offensive initiative and swing\r\nnorthward to cut off Nogi when the culminating attack had been\r\ndelivered. Sandiapu, that had been the scene of the desperate failure\r\nof Gripenberg, was the pivot for the Japanese attack. General Oku\r\navoided the Russian right centre just left of the railroad, because\r\nthese positions were in part commanded by Putiloff Hill, and the taking\r\nof the Russian fortifications here would only mean a falling back under\r\nthe protection of Russia's impregnable centre. With Sandiapu as a\r\npivot, however, Oku drove the attack in a northeasterly direction,\r\nrather than northward, parallel to the Russian lines. His assaults\r\nbegan simultaneously with Kuroki's attack at Tsinkhetchen, and in one\r\ntremendous dash the Russian line was broken, crumbled in the plain five\r\nmiles north of Sandiapu, and the struggle had begun which after ten\r\ndays' fighting had doubled the Russian flank back until its line,\r\nbeginning at a point five miles west of the railroad, was bent back at\r\nright angles to the line it had occupied at the opening of the battle.\r\nThis achievement had been accomplished in the face of a determined\r\nresistance. Throughout the struggle the artillery was rendered useless\r\nfor hours at a time, while the infantry engaged in hand-to-hand\r\nstruggles. The story of the attack on a single of the score or more of\r\nvillages is typical of all of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Village by Village Taken]\r\n\r\nThere was a brief lull just at dawn. Then for an hour field guns roared\r\nall along the line searching for the infantry lines and batteries of\r\nthe enemy. House and walls were the targets. Shells in deadly showers\r\nground walls to dust, ploughed the fields, shaved the crowns from\r\nbroken ground that might hide creeping lines of troops. An hour of\r\nsystematic, sweeping bombardment, then the army was ready for the\r\nbusiness of the hour. From cover on every side little squads of\r\nJapanese troops dashed into the open. Ten yards they sped then threw\r\nthemselves prone on the ground wherever any approach to protection\r\ncould be found.\r\n\r\nNow it was the turn of the Russian guns to bark. From all along their\r\nlines in the dusk of dawn resounded the din of artillery. The open,\r\nwhen the advance had begun, instantly grew lividly aflame with bursting\r\nshrapnel. It seemed that nothing could live under that awful baptism of\r\nsteel. Then the din subsided before the Japanese, glasses glued to\r\ntheir eyes, could catch telltale feathers of smoke that even the\r\nsmokeless powder sends out from big guns. The echoes of the guns are\r\nstill reverberating far away among the foothills, when up from the\r\nground again spring those lithe, invincible shadows that speed once\r\nmore ten yards or more and then vanish as they hug the earth. Where\r\nthere were five, three have survived; here and there a single one gets\r\nup to continue the advance where a group had been. But from behind\r\nothers are making these short dashes, too. The plain finally is fairly\r\nalive with troops, dashing forward, taking cover, dashing forward\r\nagain. Five hundred yards away when they started, their numbers are\r\nalready thinning when the first hundred yards has been crossed. Others\r\nfill the gaps and two hundred yards are crossed, and in the growing\r\nlight it can be seen that strewn all along the line of the advance are\r\nforms that lie stark and still when the living spring to action for\r\nthose unhalting sprints.\r\n\r\nNow Russian riflemen are heard from. Rifles crackle from every side,\r\nand then death begins high carnival. But the advance goes on. No rising\r\nnow and speeding those few yards. The Japanese are crawling. The living\r\nuse the bodies of the dead for protection. Often pushing these before\r\nthem they cover yard by yard, the zone of death. Now only a hundred\r\nyards divides them from the outermost huts of the village. Hotter and\r\nhotter becomes the fire of the defenders. In a moment the assault has\r\nbegun. A hundred, two hundred, are on their feet. Bullets eat holes in\r\ntheir ranks, but only the dead falter. Presently, with the ring of\r\nsteel on steel, the ranks close. The rifle fire is fitful in the\r\ndisorder of hand-to-hand fighting. Then up from all parts of the open\r\nrise scores of Japanese. They sweep into the midst of the fray, whole\r\ncompanies still coming press the fight. Back through the village from\r\nhouse to house, from wall to wall, goes on the hand-to-hand, man to man\r\nduel. Never once did the Japanese fail in the early days of the\r\nstruggle to drive back the Russian defenders, for when one such attack\r\nfailed there were countless others eager to begin again the same\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Artillery Impotent]\r\n\r\nThe Russians seemed demoralized by the apparent impotency of their\r\nartillery to prevent these advances. Often the Russian lines suffered\r\nby their shrapnel, so thoroughly was the ground in front of their\r\npositions searched by their gunners. Nevertheless, the guns had\r\nhardly hushed before men seemed to spring from the ground and speed\r\non toward them. To the more superstitious there was something uncanny\r\nabout this little foe. The only solution was the open ranks, the\r\neach-man-for-himself, the use of every fragment of shelter. Russian\r\nsolid formations fairly melted as they rushed into the Japanese\r\nshrapnel fire. A single shell mowed down a score. It took ten shells\r\nat least to disable a single Japanese because of the way they\r\nscattered out over the field.\r\n\r\nJust behind the final advance of the main force which never moved until\r\nthe skirmish attack had engaged the Russians too closely for either\r\nartillery or a destructive rifle fire, came the engineers with\r\ntelegraph and telephone equipment. Bamboo poles were swiftly in place,\r\nand yard by yard the wire followed the advance. Presently at Oku's\r\nheadquarters, usually the shelter of a hut within a mile of the actual\r\nfighting, would come the thick click, click of the telegraph or the\r\njingle of the telephone. \"We have taken the village\" was usually the\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nThus village after village was taken in this memorable struggle, until,\r\nas has been told, the Russian line had been driven from miles of\r\npositions upon which months of labor had been expended and in the\r\nclosing days of the battle were paralleling the railroad from the\r\nSha-ho to a point five miles northwest of Mukden. Oku had done his part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When the Crushing Blow Fell]\r\n\r\nThus we have told the story of the battle on the Japanese right, centre\r\nand rear, up to the time when the assault of the Port Arthur army was\r\nto be launched. The battle had continued without intermission from\r\nFebruary 24 to March 5. The Japanese on the right or east front had\r\ndriven back the enemy from his advanced positions across the rugged\r\nhills of the Tie range and was battling to drive back that flank on the\r\nrailroad and to effect an advance to reach a position in the rear of\r\nMukden. At the centre a struggle had gone on without decisive result\r\nbecause, largely, the Japanese only planned to keep this part of the\r\nenemy's line busy with fighting until the flank-attack armies achieved\r\npositions, either in the rear of Mukden or near enough to strike, and\r\nstrike hard at the foe should he be compelled to retreat. Oku's army,\r\nwe have seen, came nearest to accomplishing this task. So far as the\r\nactual results of the fighting of these three armies were concerned,\r\nwhile the Japanese everywhere had outfought and had outgeneralled the\r\nRussians, there was nothing accomplished which made the situation\r\nparticularly alarming to Kuropatkin. His left flank, eastward had been\r\ndriven in twenty miles but with the aid of heavy reinforcements he had\r\nchecked the enemy five miles away from Fushan and when March 5 drew to\r\na close the reports from that direction to the Commander-in-Chief not\r\nonly recounted that every assault by the Japanese had been repulsed but\r\nthat after thirteen bloody reverses on March 4, Kuroki seemed to be\r\ndrawing away to the south.\r\n\r\nHope rose high in the mind of the Russian General. He believed that\r\nthis attack on the east had been the real strength of the Japanese\r\nattack. He perceived that the Japanese had not been in earnest at the\r\ncenter and he attributed reverses on his right to the fact, that he had\r\nwithdrawn a full division from Lieutenant-General Kaulbars, commanding\r\nthere and he hoped, now that Kuroki seemed to have given up the\r\nstruggle, that he could withdraw a force from the east, throw it into\r\nthe fight west of the railroad, turn the tide against Oku and win a\r\nnegative victory by defeating the manifest purpose of the Japanese to\r\ndrive him from the Sha-ho River positions. While his right flank had\r\nbeen bent back through an arc of ninety degrees from the original\r\nposition on the Hun River they still held a strong line five miles west\r\nof the railroad. The falling back of these troops had resulted in a\r\nloss of ground but had also resulted in a strong concentration and his\r\nlines were capable of greater resistance as a result. Then, too, the\r\nJapanese had been fighting continuously for twelve days and must be\r\nnear the limits of human endurance. Altogether when the sun went down\r\non the field the Russian Commander felt that victory was near. He did\r\nnot expect a decisive, positive victory but after so long a series of\r\ndisasters even that sort of victory which consisted only in having\r\nprevented the enemy from forcing the abandonment of a position, would\r\nhave sent a thrill of joy and hope through the army and the Russian\r\nnation. It would have inspired the army with confidence for its work.\r\nIt would have been a weapon at home against the revolutionist, the\r\nopponent of the war, the foes of the dynasty. For the General himself\r\nit meant a return of confidence in his leadership on the part of the\r\narmy, on the part of the Emperor. It would go far toward wiping out the\r\nrecord of unbroken defeat, retreat, disaster which had marked the\r\nentire campaign. Victory was more vital to Kuropatkin, personally, than\r\nto Russia. The General was fighting as much for personal vindication as\r\nfor the glory of Russian arms. To him, therefore, the outlook for even\r\na negative success was charged with personal happiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Cloud in the West]\r\n\r\nThis was the outlook when day dawned, March 5, 1905. By nightfall of\r\nthat same day a cloud, no larger then than a man's hand, was rising in\r\nthe west that was to break in a storm, crushing the Russian defense,\r\nbanishing the dreams of Kuropatkin. That cloud was the army of General\r\nNogi.\r\n\r\nThe tale must be told from the beginning.\r\n\r\nPort Arthur capitulated January 2, 1905. A week later General Nogi\r\nstood within the heart of the Russian settlement there and reviewed\r\ncompanies from the various army units that had participated in the\r\nsiege. Out to the world went the message that Nogi's great task was\r\naccomplished. But there was other work for Nogi. Within three weeks\r\nafter the Gibraltar of the Orient had fallen, 80,000 troops, released\r\nby that event were bound northward to join the armies under Marshal\r\nOyama, then in winter quarters facing Kuropatkin. The army had been\r\nreinforced largely from Japan with fresh troops who had not known the\r\nsmell of smoke. Enough of these had been sent to equal any possible\r\nreinforcement that could be sent to Kuropatkin, as nearly as this\r\nnumber could be estimated. Nogi's army meant reinforcement of an\r\nentirely different kind. Here were men inured to the rigors of\r\ncampaigning by eleven months of as arduous fighting as ever fell to\r\ntroops in all of the history of war. By the first week in February the\r\nentire army had reached its new position west of Liao-yang, ready for\r\nwhatever mission might be assigned to it. That task was the actual\r\ncapture of Mukden. More than that, Nogi's men were called upon to break\r\nthe defence on the east, to strike the railroad north of Mukden, to\r\nintercept the line of retreat and to join with Kuroki in the enveloping\r\nof the Russian army. It was the crowning work of the battle. It was a\r\ntribute to the bravery and skill of the men who had humbled Port\r\nArthur. It was one that meant hardship, all but superhuman exertion,\r\nbut if they succeeded it meant that chief credit for another great\r\nvictory would belong to this army of veterans.\r\n\r\nNogi's work did not begin until the battle had been well developed on\r\nevery front. His was to take up the work begun against the Russian\r\nright flank by Oku and with a fresh army carry it to a conclusion. As\r\nhas been shown, Oku prepared the way in a splendid manner. He broke the\r\nRussian lines and rolled back the flank from the plains east and west\r\nof the Hun River. When this had been accomplished Nogi's army got under\r\nway. Leaving their positions west of Liao-yang, the veterans sped\r\nnorthwards. They crossed the Hun at a point a few miles above the\r\njunction of the Hun and Liao Rivers where two days before Oku had begun\r\nforcing back the Russians. His army after the crossing, was divided,\r\none small detachment, amply supplied with artillery moving swiftly\r\nnortheastward to the Liao; thence northward to Sinmintin, thirty-five\r\nmiles due west of Mukden. This city was outside the limits of the war\r\nzone as laid down by the Powers in their agreement to preserve the\r\nneutrality of China. Nevertheless it had been a veritable supply depot\r\nfor the Russians, caravans of foodstuffs of all kinds and even of\r\nammunition coming from Chinese points on the Siberian border and from\r\nsouthern coast cities to deliver contraband here to waiting bands of\r\nCossacks. As a result of this use of the city by the Russians the\r\nJapanese did not hesitate to enter there. They found a few Cossacks and\r\na great horde of Russian civil officials together with great stores of\r\nsupplies most of it in carts as it had reached the city ready to start\r\nwestward for the Russian base at Mukden. Some prisoners were taken but\r\nno goods that were not actually in the possession of Russian civil and\r\nmilitary officials were seized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kuropatkin Ignores Danger]\r\n\r\nThe detachment then began the dash westward along the Sinmintin-Mukden\r\nroad toward Mukden. On the morning of January 5, they formed a junction\r\nwith the main force that had marched northward on a line parallel with\r\nthe railroad, twenty miles west of the Russians and, of course, had met\r\nno opposition, so effectively had Oku prepared the way. The news of the\r\narrival of the Japanese at Sinmintin, March 5, was the first intimation\r\nof this movement and General Kuropatkin ignored the news imagining that\r\nthe force had only been a handful of Japanese cavalry raiders. They\r\nwere raiders, in fact, but there were 80,000 of them and they were\r\nunder orders from Marshal Oyama to enter Mukden as conquerors on March\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Center Positions Abandoned]\r\n\r\nIn their four days' march northward Nogi's army covered 30 miles the\r\nfirst day, 25 miles the second day, 23 miles the third day and 28 miles\r\nthe fourth day, and after that tremendous feat their real work was\r\nbefore them. The army turned eastward at the Sinmintin-Mukden road,\r\ntwenty miles from Mukden, and five miles nearer Mukden they met the\r\nfirst resistance. As a protection to Mukden, Kuropatkin had thrown\r\nthree lines of protective works eastward. Nogi's army came upon the\r\nfirst of these March 6. His troops, swept over the Russian defenders\r\nlike the sea over a sunken wreck, so swiftly had come the overwhelming\r\nattack. March 7, the veterans covered the distance to the second line\r\nof defences. In the meantime Kuropatkin had awakened. He saw that he\r\nwas in danger of being overwhelmed from this unexpected quarter. His\r\nvisions of victory of March 4, were already fleeting and only two days\r\nhad gone by. Every available squadron from centre and left were ordered\r\npost-haste to meet the danger. The Russian lines that up to this time\r\nhad only been called upon to concentrate by orderly retrograde\r\nmovements were called upon to reform the whole line, falling back from\r\nhis impregnable position at the center, south of the Sha-ho. There was\r\nmovement everywhere. On the east regiment after regiment moved out and\r\nthe remaining regiments realigned themselves. This fact is important\r\nbecause it brought Kuroki's opportunity to fulfil the mission that had\r\nbeen entrusted to him and will be told later. Meantime Nogi's veterans\r\nrushed on unchecked until March 8, when the Russian resistance showed\r\nthe strength that had come with the reinforcements. Baron General\r\nKaulbars took immediate command, met and placed the arriving Russian\r\nregiments and displayed finer generalship than any general in the\r\nentire Russian line throughout the battle. On the east Rennenkampf had\r\nsplendid plans for offensive movements until General Kuroki made a\r\nmove, then his plans crumbled like houses of cards and he fought only a\r\ndefensive fight from start to finish, brilliant though his resistance\r\nmay have been. But Kaulbars, when his force had been completed, met\r\nNogi manfully and the duel between these great captains forms a notable\r\naddition to the history of military achievement.\r\n\r\nFor all the magnificent offensive ability of the Russian General,\r\nhowever, Nogi's veterans would not be denied. The first fifteen miles\r\nof their advance was like the rush of a hurricane. Then came the real\r\nfighting. This continued March 8, 9, 10, in which time the Russians had\r\nbeen forced back literally step by step on Mukden. Calmly the Japanese\r\nGeneral ordered assault after assault on the Russian lines ignoring the\r\nheaps of the dead that, when the third day of the battle had brought\r\ndecisive victory, numbered 20,000 choked into the narrow line of\r\nadvance through those last five miles to Mukden. The shells from his\r\nartillery swept the railroad and the Trade Road that runs beside the\r\nrailroad over which the Russian center was retreating. If Nogi, in\r\nthose three days saw 20,000 of his brave men fall and if this\r\nimperturbable soldier felt any pang there was balm in the fact that he\r\nhad inflicted a loss on the enemy of three for every one of his own men\r\nwho had fallen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Ingenuity Marvellous]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the three days whole new chapters were written into\r\nbooks of strategy. The Japanese General and troops answered once for\r\nall the accusation that they were mere imitators of western methods.\r\nAmong the uncanny tricks that they successfully used many have no equal\r\nin military annals. Taking advantage of the first dust which began to\r\nrise on the second day and played an important part in the whole of the\r\nbattle, a Japanese force turned their backs on the Russians and fired\r\ninto the ranks of their own men pushing on behind them. The Russians\r\ntook the force thus engaged for reinforcements and valorously aided\r\nthem in holding off the Japanese pursuit. Meantime, back, back, step by\r\nstep this mock Russian battle line drew nearer and nearer the duped\r\nRussians. Presently when only a few yards separated them they turned\r\nwith the savage battlecry that had carried them over the ramparts of\r\nRihlung fort and practically annihilated the victims of the ruse. This\r\nwas only one of many unheard of acts which marked the path of Nogi to\r\nvictory. When shells from his artillery began to reach the railroad his\r\nbattle front turned as on a pivot around the little town of Tatchekiao\r\nand the advance was directed not directly toward Mukden but to a point\r\nfive miles north of that city as part of the effort to envelop the\r\nRussians and more particularly to cut off the retreat. Thereupon the\r\nRussian resistance was redoubled in fury. With reinforcements that had\r\nbeen sent to this danger point the Russians outnumbered the Japanese\r\ntwo to one. But just as it was of more and more importance for the\r\nRussians to hold Nogi in check so it was more and more important for\r\nNogi to crush the resistance and to drive his wedge in on Mukden. The\r\nstruggle at every moment was hand to hand. The artillery on both sides\r\nfired into the indiscriminate masses of struggling men. Absolute frenzy\r\nmarked the struggle as waged on both side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RETREAT FROM MUKDEN.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retreat a Carnival of Slaughter]\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely the Russian resistance weakened and with dismay\r\nKuropatkin saw that his flank could not withstand the weight of the\r\nincessant attack. If the flank should be broken it meant annihilation\r\nor surrender for his entire force. Retreat would be impossible except\r\nat inhuman sacrifice of life. Already shells were reaching the railroad\r\nwhile the battle was swinging northeastward toward the line of retreat\r\nand every possible man had been thrown into the defence. There was only\r\none thing to be done--retreat, and the order went forth on the evening\r\nof March 7. Under cover of darkness every available car had been loaded\r\nwith stores, guns, whatever could be saved. Troops in Mukden piled into\r\nmiles of box-cars that soon after midnight began the dash northward.\r\nThe rearguard was organized of the troops then opposing Nogi and such\r\nof those from the center as could be made available. These retreated\r\neastward from Mukden leaving as the last of the center army passed\r\nnorthward toward Tie Pass, the next station. The flank that had so long\r\nopposed Kuroki in the last crumbling of the Russian defence was\r\ncompletely cut off. The disorder along the front occasioned by the\r\nhasty withdrawal of reinforcements for the hard pressed right flank\r\nwest of Mukden has been mentioned. Kuroki, who amazed the Russians by\r\nthe readiness with which he interpreted every move that they made, saw\r\nin this disorder his opportunity. He had been battling for an\r\nopportunity to pierce the Russian line and join with Nogi, but fairly\r\nhad been checked and held by the tremendous resistance of Rennenkampf.\r\nA brigade fell back from in front of the left flank of his army.\r\nAnother stood ready to fall into its place. But while the very\r\nmanoeuvre was being carried out Kuroki struck hard directly between\r\nthe two forces. His wedge went deep into the Russian ranks and the\r\nJapanese General threw in behind them every available unit of his army.\r\nDesperately the Russians struggled to crush the foe and rejoin their\r\nbroken lines but the Japanese, every man of them, knew that their hour\r\nhad come. Thousands fell but thousands took their places. Mile by mile\r\nwent Kuroki's wedge and by March 10, when on the west Nogi was forcing\r\nthe vanguard of his fighting line into Mukden, Kuroki at last had won a\r\nposition from which to strike the long line of Russians now surging\r\nnorthward in a retreat that had now become a rout.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oyama's Prophecy Fulfilled]\r\n\r\nMukden had been taken. Nogi had fulfilled Oyama's prophecy. So far as\r\nthe long struggle had been for possession of the Sha-ho River position\r\nand Mukden it was over. The Japanese had won a momentous victory. Vast\r\nspoils had fallen into their possession. Fully twenty thousand\r\nprisoners had surrendered when Kuroki had broken through the Russian\r\nleft, completing the circle of steel around whatever of the Russian\r\narmy had not already made good its escape north of the line from Fushan\r\nto Mukden. There were hundreds of thousands of shells, millions of\r\nrounds of small ammunition; there were stores enough to feed the army\r\nfor months, there was Russian property valued at millions, there were\r\nguns, horses, wagons, railroad material, enough for one hundred and\r\nfifty miles of track. There was also the knowledge that a loss in men\r\nhad been inflicted three times as great as the Japanese had suffered.\r\nMukden and Fushan and a score of smaller towns and cities had been\r\ntaken, invaluable coal mines were now within the Japanese lines\r\npractically the last upon which the Russians could rely for fuel with\r\nwhich to operate the railroad. The victory, indeed, from every\r\nstandpoint, save one, was complete.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army had escaped.\r\n\r\nThis escape had been effected, because despite the wonderful extent of\r\ntheir victory the Japanese armies had failed to meet across the north\r\nof the Russian position before the bulk of Kuropatkin's army had swept\r\nout of the mouth of the bottle. Nature herself saved them. When on the\r\nevening of March 7, Kuropatkin ordered the retreat the great\r\nbattlefield had already become enveloped in tremendous clouds of\r\nblinding dust and snow swirled up from the dry plains by a tremendous\r\ngale. Beginning on March 7, this veritable cyclone increased in fury\r\nthroughout the night of March, 8, and continued with unbroken severity\r\nduring March 9, 10 and 11, days vital to the Russian army. In the main\r\nthe Japanese suffered most from the storm. Their object was to find the\r\nfoe and attack, the Russian object was simply to plunge northward\r\ntoward safety. Ultimately the storm had reached a degree of violence\r\nwhich made sight impossible and the Japanese pursuit was halted at a\r\nmoment when it seemed that the full purpose of their Generals' strategy\r\nwas to be realized. When two days later they were able to take up the\r\npursuit the possibility of complete success had passed. But there was\r\nstill opportunity to strike the fleeing army and the horrors of that\r\nflight and pursuit, from March 12 to March 15, will never adequately be\r\ntold. The Japanese forced a way parallel to the line of pursuit on both\r\nsides and clung relentlessly to the routed army. Here a company was\r\nannihilated by furious cavalry charge. Here a regiment was cut off,\r\nsurrounded and compelled to surrender after awful slaughter. Forty\r\nthousand prisoners were taken in the four days of this carnival of\r\nslaughter and when the remnants of the Russian army had reached Tie\r\nPass, forty-three miles away, Kuropatkin had lost 170,000 men, killed,\r\nwounded and missing. His army had lost fifty per cent. of its strength,\r\na slaughter not equalled in the history of civilization. No parallel\r\nexists until the half mythological days of Asian conflicts are reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  Battle of the Japan Sea--Fleet Russia's Last Hope--Tragedy\r\n    of the North Sea--Reaches Asiatic Waters--On the Eve of\r\n    the Struggle--Russians in Double Line--Borodino First to\r\n    Go Down--Russians in Full Flight--Admiral Nebogatoff\r\n    Surrenders--Togo's Reports of the Battle--Rozhdestvensky\r\n    a Prisoner--Searching Sea for Remnants--Japan's Loss Only\r\n    424 Men--Your Utmost for the Empire--Russian Line\r\n    Enveloped--Destroyers Took Last Thrust--As Sailors Saw\r\n    the Battle--Blowing up the Izumrud--The News Reaches\r\n    Russia--Russian Story of Disaster--Why Russians Were\r\n    Defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Japan Sea]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese-Russian war has added many pages of awe-inspiring\r\nachievement to the vast volume of the world's valorous records of land\r\nand sea. Notable, among all of the amazing array, ever will stand the\r\nnaval battle of the Sea of Japan, fought in the Straits of Korea,\r\nSunday, May 28; Monday, May 29, and continuing as a pursuit on Tuesday,\r\nMay 30, 1905. Russia's enormous armada of thirty-seven fighting ships,\r\nand one hundred ships in all, had been sent to the Far East to recover\r\ncommand of the sea from Japan, which had been won from her in the naval\r\ncampaign of 1904, when the Russian Port Arthur fleet had been destroyed\r\nand the Russian Vladivostok squadron had been weakened to a helpless\r\ncondition. The result was overwhelming victory for Japan, achieved at\r\nthe cost to Russia of the annihilation of her entire armada. No naval\r\nbattle of history equals this in the enormous power of the fighting\r\narray; none exceeds it in the degree of its decisiveness. Trafalgar, a\r\nhundred years earlier, affords the only possible parallel, and\r\nTrafalgar, for a century the world's greatest naval struggle, was\r\noutdone.\r\n\r\nThe story begins eight months before these thrilling events in the\r\nStraits of Korea, when the Russian fleet, variously called the Baltic\r\nFleet and the Second Pacific Fleet, sailed from Cronstadt, in the\r\nBaltic, on its 20,000 mile journey, around Africa and by way of the\r\nIndian Ocean to the Orient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fleet Russia's Last Hope]\r\n\r\nThe fleet represented every available Russian warship. A half dozen\r\nothers, too old for active service or still in course of building, were\r\nleft in Russian waters, the Czar deciding to leave the home shores\r\npractically unprotected after securing a secret agreement with Germany,\r\nwhich amounted to a temporary offensive and defensive alliance. The\r\nfighting strength of the squadrons included seven battleships, two\r\narmored cruisers, six cruisers, with a full complement of torpedo boat\r\ndestroyers, a fleet equal, on paper, to the entire available navy of\r\nJapan, and in some aspects stronger than any Japan could hope to\r\nmuster. Supreme command of the armada was entrusted to Vice-Admiral\r\nRozhdestvensky, with three divisional commanders, Vice-Admiral\r\nVolkersham, Rear Admiral Nebogatoff, and Rear Admiral Enquist. The\r\nultimate task of the fleet was to regain mastery of the sea from Japan,\r\nin undisputed possession by reason of having destroyed the Russian\r\nPacific squadrons at Port Arthur and Vladivostok. Vladivostok, Russia's\r\nsole remaining port in the Orient, was the destination. From that point\r\nit was intended to assail Japan on the sea; to interrupt her transport\r\nservice, which was vital to her army then in the midst of a victorious\r\ncampaign, 300 miles from the sea, in the heart of Manchuria, and thus\r\ncripple and harass the Island Empire until no other course than to sue\r\nfor peace would be open to her. The task was enormous; so vastly\r\ndifficult, indeed, that until the actual departure of the fleet few,\r\nanywhere, believed that such a plan was seriously contemplated. Even\r\nwhen departure had been made, experts rather held to the view that\r\nRussia, herself, meant to ask for peace and was merely making a\r\ndemonstration that might be counted on to modify Japan's demands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tragedy of the North Sea]\r\n\r\nThe voyage had hardly been begun when an incident occurred, which has\r\nbeen already narrated, and which astonished the entire world and nearly\r\nled to war between Russia and Great Britain. In the North Sea, at the\r\npoint known as the Dogger Bank, the Russian vessels encountered the\r\nGamecock fishing fleet from Hull, England. The Russian admiral mistook\r\nsome of the trawlers for torpedo boats and ordered his vessels to fire.\r\nOne fishing boat was sunk and two men were killed, others being badly\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nFor some days the excitement in England was intense, and British\r\nofficial documents published later on showed that the two countries\r\nwere on the point of war, but the crisis was ended by an agreement to\r\nrefer the incident to an international naval tribunal. This board of\r\ninquiry met in Paris, and after a long investigation reported that the\r\nRussian contention that hostile torpedo boats were present when the\r\nfiring took place was not justified. Rozhdestvensky, however, was\r\nacquitted of the charge of conduct unbecoming a sailor, and the\r\nincident was ultimately closed by the payment of a large money\r\nindemnity by Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Dogger Bank affair caused some delay to the Russian ships, though\r\nnot nearly as much as Englishmen expected. After leaving the Straits of\r\nGibraltar the fleet divided, one division, under Admiral\r\nRozhdestvensky, proceeding by way of the Cape of Good Hope and the\r\nother, under Admiral Vollkersham, going via the Suez Canal.\r\nRozhdestvensky had with him most of the battleships and Voelkersam the\r\nmajority of the cruisers.\r\n\r\nBoth squadrons proceeded very slowly, and the reports from time to time\r\nregarding their whereabouts were of the most puzzling character. On\r\nJanuary 1, however, Rozhdestvensky reached Madagascar, and there he\r\nawaited the cruiser squadron. The long time spent there led to renewed\r\nassertions that the Admiralty at St. Petersburg would never order the\r\nfleet to the Far East. In the middle of March, however, reports were\r\nprinted that the Russians had sailed. These reports were denied, and\r\nthen repeated, and at length it was definitely established that the\r\nBaltic fleet had sailed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fleet Reaches Asiatic Waters]\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard of it till April 8, when the news came that the\r\nfleet had passed Singapore and was in the China Sea. On entering the\r\nChina Sea, Admiral Rozhdestvensky sailed directly to Kamranh Bay, on\r\nthe coast of Indo-China, in French territorial waters. The prolonged\r\nstay of the fleet resulted in a vigorous protest from Japan to France,\r\nback of which was the possibility that Japan would invoke the\r\nAnglo-Japanese alliance, calling upon Great Britain to compel respect\r\nof neutrality by France. France, in addition to instructing her\r\nrepresentatives in Indo-China to demand that the Russians leave\r\nterritorial waters, forwarded the protest to Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the Eve of the Struggle]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Rozhdestvensky, on the eve of the great struggle, had dismissed\r\nevery unnecessary ship. More than a half hundred colliers and supply\r\nships, which had accompanied the fleet or had met it in the China Sea,\r\nwere dismissed after the last ton of coal had been stored on the big\r\nfighting ships.\r\n\r\n                           THE RUSSIAN FLEET.\r\n\r\n                      Displace- I.

Then came this word, that the great\r\ndestiny-laden armada was sighted approaching Admiral Togo's lair in the\r\nStraits of Korea. Forty-eight hours more, and the Japanese admiralty\r\nwas electrified by the characteristically modest announcement from\r\nJapan's great naval captain:\r\n\r\n\"The main force of the Russian second and third fleets is nearly\r\nannihilated. Please feel assured of it.\"\r\n\r\nBetween lies a tale marvelous for brilliancy, valor, daring, for all\r\nthat is spectacular and awe-inspiring in war; for all that spells glory\r\nto the victor; for all that defeat, disaster, can mean to the beaten\r\nand crushed. In brief, of Russia's seven battleships, five had been\r\nsunk, and two, captives, were flying the flag of the victor; Of the\r\nmighty array of cruisers, all but four were at the bottom of the sea.\r\nOf the destroyers, three were afloat. In the harbor of Vladivostok were\r\na single unarmored cruiser, and these three destroyers, the sorry\r\nfragments of the armada that reached this destination for which the\r\nflower of Russia's European squadron had set out. Sixty hours after the\r\nbattle three armored cruisers, the _Aurora_, _Oleg_ and _Jemtchug_,\r\nladen with wounded, riddled with shot and shell, crept into the harbor\r\nof Manila, there to be interned, with their officers, Admiral Enquist\r\namong them. As a climax to the victory, Admiral Rozhdestvensky was a\r\nprisoner, badly wounded, and in the care of Japanese physicians in the\r\nnaval hospital at Sasebo. Admiral Volkersham was dead. He had fallen in\r\nthe first havoc-working broadside from the Japanese fleet. Admiral\r\nNebogatoff was a prisoner. Without a fight he had surrendered two\r\nbattleships and two coast defense ironclads, with the result that after\r\nthe battle that had annihilated the Russian fleet, the Japanese fleet\r\nwas even more powerful than when it cleared decks for action.\r\n\r\nThe Russian fleet had, in truth, sailed into Admiral Togo's lair. The\r\nStraits of Korea lie between Japan and Korea, and are an average of one\r\nhundred miles wide. Half way across rise the Tsu Islands, which Japan\r\nhas fortified until they are a veritable Gibraltar. Only twenty-five\r\nmiles wide is the Tsushimi Channel or Strait, between Tsu Island and\r\nthe Japanese coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Under Guns of the Forts]\r\n\r\nSo narrow indeed is the water that as the Russian ships were pressed\r\neastward toward Tsu Island the forts there got range of the battleships\r\nand sank the _Oslabya_. Togo's base was at Masampho, on the Korean\r\ncoast. Thousands of Japanese knew this fact, but so deeply was the\r\nnecessity for secrecy appreciated by all classes of the islanders that\r\nthroughout the nine months of waiting the entire world never had the\r\nslightest intimation of the point from which Japan's defensive blow\r\nwould be struck. The general impression was that Formosa, the\r\nsouthernmost of the Japanese archipelago, would be chosen. This opinion\r\nwas fostered by show of activity there and by various orders calculated\r\nto mark this spot as of especial significance in the campaign. When\r\nRozhdestvensky had traversed the Straits of Formosa without opposition\r\nand had reached the China coast north of there, Russians even rejoiced,\r\ndeclaring that their admiral had outwitted the Japanese by eluding\r\ntheir trap. Meantime Togo waited. His position enabled him to meet the\r\nenemy should the direct route to Vladivostok via the Straits of Korea\r\nand the Sea of Japan be chosen, or he was in position to sail northward\r\nto intercept the Russians should Rozhdestvensky decide to go further\r\neastward into the Pacific, circle Japan, and finally approach\r\nVladivostok by La Pelouse or another of the channels between the\r\nnorthern islands of the Japanese archipelago. When Rozhdestvensky\r\nheaded north from the China coast toward the Straits of Korea he fell\r\nin with the plan of battle to meet which the whole genius of the\r\nJapanese admiral had been preparing. Only one detail failed to agree\r\nwith what Togo had expected. He believed that the Russians would shun\r\nthe narrow channel east of Tsu Island, nearer Japan, and would traverse\r\nthe western channel between Tsu Island and Korea. In the latter event\r\nthe blow would have been dealt by a dash from Mesampho. As it happened,\r\nthe fleet had only to round the northern promontory of Tsu Island and\r\nfall upon the Russians in the most disadvantageous position that could\r\nhave been found in all of the waters of the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the fleets as they approached on that fateful Saturday\r\nmorning may be shown in tabular form. The chief units are here given.\r\nIn addition, there were twelve torpedo boat destroyers with the Russian\r\nfleet and a veritable swarm of destroyers and torpedo boats with the\r\nJapanese fleet. Nevertheless, the armada, with practically twice the\r\nnumber of Japanese battleships, would, on paper, have advantage over a\r\nlarge fleet, made up so largely of lighter vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians in Double Line]\r\n\r\nThe Russian fleet advanced in a double line, the battleships on the\r\nside away from the Japanese coast; the inner line, nearer Japan, made\r\nup of cruisers and light craft. Admiral Togo swung northward of Tsu\r\nIsland, then turned sharply toward the southeast, thus moving parallel\r\nto the line of bows of the Russian ships, opening the broadsides of all\r\nof his ships, while through practically all of the first day's battle\r\nthe Russians had only available bow and forward guns, a manoeuvre\r\nwhich eliminated enough of the effectiveness of the Russian battleships\r\nto give Togo an advantage despite his weakness in these floating\r\nfortresses.\r\n\r\nIt had been planned that the initial attack should be made by the giant\r\ntwelve-inch guns of the Japanese big ships, and that under cover of\r\nthis bombardment the torpedoers and destroyers should dash for the\r\nleading Russian ships and attempt to throw the enemy's column into\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe commanders of the torpedoing flotilla had previously been summoned\r\nand had been notified in a few words by the admiral of the desperate\r\nservice that was required of them and of the small chance of any of\r\nthem reporting again for duty.\r\n\r\nThey were told, in fact, that it was a simple case of sacrifice, and\r\nthey accepted it so willingly that the admiral found it difficult to\r\ndetail a torpedo reserve in case the first division failed in its task.\r\n\r\nUntil sunset the heavy guns of the Japanese battleships and the\r\nten-inch battery of the cruiser _Kasuga_ roared and fired at the\r\noncoming Russians, while the Russian guns roared in reply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Borodino First to Go Down]\r\n\r\nFirst of the Russian battleships in line behind the protected cruiser\r\n_Jemtchung_ was the 13,000-ton _Borodino_, and these two soon showed\r\nthat they were receiving the brunt of the shelling. The cruiser\r\n_Nakhimoff_, in the van of the Russian port column, was also observed\r\nto be in distress, and then, the sun having set and the quick-setting\r\ndarkness having come, the torpedoes were sent out under cover of a\r\nstill heavier cannonade. The flotilla formed into two divisions, one\r\nheading for the battleship column of the Russians and the other for the\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\nThe searchlights of the Russian fleet threw out their great beams and\r\ntheir small gun batteries swept the sea but the swift hornets of the\r\nsea went wallowing and buzzing on their way. They circled and swept,\r\nand then came the dull roars and heaving fountains that told that the\r\ntorpedoes had been loosed from their tubes and were doing their deadly\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAgain and again came the roars, and as the Japanese searchlights swept\r\nacross the field of fight and then went out it was seen that the great\r\nbattleship _Borodino_ was sinking; that the protected cruiser\r\n_Svietlana_ was a wreck; that the battleship _Alexander III_ had gone;\r\nthat the two armored cruisers _Dimitri Donskoi_ and _Nakhimoff_ were\r\nout of the fighting. A far-sailing shell had also reached and sunk the\r\nsupply ship _Kamchatka_. Thus ended the first day's fight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians in Full Flight]\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the night of Saturday, May 27, the shattered Russian\r\nfleet reformed as well as it might, and once more took up its\r\ndespairing run for the Sea of Japan and the haven of Vladivostok.\r\n\r\nHanging on to the already beaten enemy, an easy matter with his faster\r\nships, Togo picked up the Russians all of Saturday night with his\r\nsearchlights, occasionally sending a long-distance shell toward one of\r\nthe shadowy hulls that were racing to get through the straits.\r\n\r\nBut just as Togo had selected his fighting ground for working out one\r\nchapter of the tragedy, so now he chose the scene of the second day's\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast of Osino Island lies a dangerous little archipelago\r\nknown as the Liancourt Rocks, and with his battleships and heavily\r\narmored cruisers the Japanese admiral stood out in crescent form across\r\nthe Korean Strait and drove the enemy toward this dangerous running.\r\n\r\nKeeping together in some semblance of order, five Russians, consisting\r\nof the battleships _Nicolai I_ and _Orel_ and the coast defence vessels\r\n_Senyanin_ and _Apraxine_ and the protected cruiser _Izumrud_, were\r\nheading bravely for the Sea of Japan. Seeing a possibility of their\r\nescape, Togo, who was personally conducting the pursuit, signaled to\r\nclose in and attack.\r\n\r\nWith their forward turrets blazing and roaring, the Japanese squadron\r\ndashed on. The Russians replied vigorously for a time, but the gunnery\r\nof the Japanese was too deadly and accurate; shells were carrying death\r\nand destruction into the fleeing five, and the fight went out of the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admiral Nebogatoff Surrenders]\r\n\r\nOne after another flew surrender signals, the Japanese ceased firing,\r\nand the _Nicolai I_, _Orel_, _Senyanin_ and _Apraxine_ were added to\r\nthe Mikado's navy. Only the _Izumrud_ got away. Fleeter than her\r\nsisters, she steamed boldly to the northwest. But she was doomed. Swift\r\npursuing Japanese cruisers followed, hurling after her tons of metal,\r\nmuch of it taking effect. The end came when the Russian ship, entering\r\nVladimir Bay, went fast on a reef. The Russian captain blew up the ship.\r\n\r\nSo practically ended the second day's fight, and here again the\r\napparently impossible happened--Togo's captains all reported, \"No\r\ndamage to men or ships.\"\r\n\r\nTogo's captains, had, however, other things to report, for while the\r\nmain force of the combined squadron was hammering the four Russians\r\ninto subjection off the Liancourt Rocks others of the cruisers were\r\nchasing scattered Russian ships, while still others were completing the\r\nwork of destruction around Osino Island. Two special service ships and\r\na destroyer were captured, and so was the armored cruiser _Monomach_,\r\nbut she foundered soon after transference of flags.\r\n\r\nAnd there were prisoners to report, 3,000 of them, including the\r\nunhappy Nebogatoff, while up and down the seas the fight between\r\npursued and pursuer still went on.\r\n\r\nBattles at sea are necessarily fought away from the eyes of neutral\r\nobservers. The active participants are unable to know of more than the\r\nimmediate scene of the drama in which their own ship is engaged. Even\r\nthe admiral of the fleet is unable to see all that occurs. Hence\r\ndetailed, continuous accounts of such occurrences rarely, if ever, are\r\nwritten until years later the disconnected stories of here one, there\r\nanother, can be assembled, corrected, dovetailed. Sufficient time has\r\nnot elapsed since this remarkable battle to permit of such assembling\r\nof facts. But both Japanese and Russians have told of individual\r\nexperiences. These have a graphic interest, coming hot from the scene\r\nof the great events which, perhaps, a more finished narrative might\r\nlack. First in interest, come the actual reports from the admiral\r\nhimself. Few great fighters have been men of fewer words than this\r\nTogo. His reports, and, indeed, all of the Japanese reports, have been\r\nin marked contrast to the elaborate, verbose messages sent to the\r\nEmperor of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe story of the battle, as told by Admiral Togo, follows:\r\n\r\nFirst report, received morning May 27:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Togo's Reports of the Battle]\r\n\r\n\"Immediately upon the receipt of report that Russian squadron was in\r\nsight our combined squadron started for attack. Weather is fine to-day,\r\nbut with heavy seas.\"\r\n\r\nSecond report, received night May 27:\r\n\r\n\"Combined squadron attacked Russian squadron to-day near Okinoshima\r\n(southeast of Tsushima) and defeated it, sinking at least four ships\r\nand inflicting heavy damage upon others. Damage to our ships is\r\ninsignificant. Our destroyer and torpedo flotillas delivered attack\r\nafter sunset.\"\r\n\r\nThird report, received Monday, May 29.\r\n\r\n\"Main force of our combined squadron continued pursuit since the 27th,\r\nand attacked (28th) near Liancourt Rocks (northeast of Okinoshima) a\r\nsquadron consisting of _Nicolai I_ (battleship), _Orel_ (battleship),\r\n_Senyanin_, _Apraxin_ and _Izumurud_. _Izumurud_ fled while remaining\r\nfour vessels surrendered. No damage to our ships. According to\r\nstatements of prisoners, vessels sunk in engagement May 27 were\r\n_Borodino_ (battleship), _Alexandre III_ (battleship), _Jemtchug_ and\r\nthree other ships. Rear Admiral Nebogatoff and about 2,000 other\r\nRussians were taken prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are damages suffered by enemy in addition to those given\r\nabove since commencement of battle, as reported by commanders not under\r\nimmediate command of Togo and by observation stations:\r\n\r\nSUNK--_Admiral Nakhimoff_, _Dmitri Donskoi_, _Svietlana_, _Admiral\r\nUsakoff_, _Kamchatka_, _Irutshush_ and three destroyers.\r\n\r\n_Vladimir Monomach_, foundered after capture. One special service ship,\r\nwhole name unknown, and one destroyer captured.\r\n\r\nRussian losses definitely known so far may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo battleships, one coast-defence ship, five cruisers, two special\r\nships, three destroyers were sunk; two battleships, two coast-defence\r\nships, one special service ship, one destroyer were captured. It is not\r\nyet clear whether three vessels, as stated by prisoners to have been\r\nsunk, are included or not in above list. There are more than 1,000\r\nprisoners, besides 2,000 taken by main force of combined squadron.\r\n\r\n\"The naval engagement is still in progress, so that it will take some\r\ntime before the final results can be known.\"\r\n\r\nFourth report from Togo received afternoon, May 30:\r\n\r\n\"The main force of our combined fleet, upon accepting surrender of the\r\nremaining Russian main force near Liancourt Rocks, in the afternoon of\r\nMay 28, as already reported, stopped pursuit, and while engaged in the\r\ndisposition of surrendered ships found in a southwestern direction the\r\n_Admiral Ushakoff_, a coast defence ship. Thereupon _Iwate_ and\r\n_Yakumo_ were immediately dispatched in pursuit and invited her to\r\nsurrender, but she refused and was sunk at 6 P. M. Her crew of over 300\r\nmen were rescued.\r\n\r\n\"Cruiser _Dimitri Donskoi_ was also found in the northwestern direction\r\nat 5 P. M. and was immediately overtaken and was fired upon vigorously\r\nby our fourth division and second destroyer flotilla.\r\n\r\n\"She was attacked that night by the second destroyer flotilla, and the\r\nnext morning was found aground on the southeastern shore of Urleung\r\nIsland, off the Korean coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rozhdenstvensky a Prisoner]\r\n\r\n\"Our destroyer _Sazanami_ captured, toward the evening of May 27, in\r\nthe south of Urleung Island, the Russian destroyer _Biedovy_, wherein\r\nwere found Admiral Rozhdestvensky and another admiral, both severely\r\nwounded, together with eighty Russians, including staff officers from\r\nthe flagship _Kniaz Suvaroff_, which was sunk at 5.29 P. M. on May 27.\r\nThey were all taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"Our cruiser _Chitose_, while cruising to the northward on the morning\r\nof May 28, found and sunk another Russian destroyer. Our cruiser\r\n_Niitaka_ and destroyer _Murakumo_ attacked also at noon on May 28 a\r\nRussian destroyer, which finally went aground.\r\n\r\n\"According to various reports hitherto received and statements of\r\nprisoners, the result of the battle from May 27 to May 29, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"_Prince Suvaroff_, _Alexander III_, _Borodino_, _Dimitri Donskoi_,\r\n_Admiral Nachimoff_, _Monomach_, _Zemtchug_, _Admiral Ushakoff_, one\r\nconverted cruiser and two destroyers sunk.\r\n\r\n\"_Nicolai I_, _Orel_, _Admiral Apraxine_, _Admiral Senyavin_ and\r\ndestroyer _Biedovy captured_. According to the prisoners, the\r\n_Osliabia_ sunk about 3 P. M., and the _Navarin_ also was sunk.\r\n\r\n\"_Almaz_, on May 27, was observed in a disabled and sinking condition,\r\nbut her final fate is yet unknown.\r\n\r\n\"The full particulars regarding the injury to our ships are not yet in\r\nhand, but as far as I could ascertain none was seriously injured, all\r\nbeing still engaged in operations. The whole casualties are not yet\r\nascertained. Casualties of first division are a little over four\r\nhundred. Prince Yorhito is in excellent health; Admiral Misu slightly\r\nwounded, May 27.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth report, received the afternoon of May 30:\r\n\r\n\"Loss of _Osliabia_, _Navarin_, confirmed. _Sissoi-Veliki_ also\r\ndefinitely reported to have sunk on the morning of May 28.\r\n\r\n\"Official statement of Russian losses so far as ascertained: Following\r\nsix battleships sunk: _Prince Suvaroff_, _Imperator_, _Alexander III_,\r\n_Borodino_, _Osliabia_, _Sissoi-Valiki_ and _Navarin_.\r\n\r\n\"Following five cruisers sunk: _Admiral Nachimoff_, _Dimitri Donskoi_,\r\n_Vladimir_, _Monomach_, _Svietlana_ and _Zemtchug_.\r\n\r\n\"Coast defence ship _Admiral Ushakoff_ sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Two special service ships, _Kamchatka_ and three destroyers also sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Two battleships, _Orel_ and _Imperator_, _Nicolai I_; two coast\r\ndefence ships, _General Admiral Apraxine_ and _Admiral Senyanvin_, and\r\none destroyer, _Biedovoy_, captured.\r\n\r\n\"Thus Russians lost altogether twenty-two ships, the aggregate tonnage\r\nwhereof amounting to 153,411 tons, besides cruiser _Almaz_, suspected\r\nto have sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Later reports from the different divisions of the fleet engaged in the\r\nnaval battle of May 27 show as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Havoc Among Battleships]\r\n\r\n\"The Russian battleship _Oslabya_ was heavily damaged in the early part\r\nof the fight on Saturday, going down at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"The first Russian vessel sunk was the battleship _Sissoi Veliky_.\r\n\r\n\"The armored cruisers _Admiral Nakhimoff_ and _Vladimir Monomach_,\r\nafter being in the general engagement during the daytime, were still\r\nfurther damaged by torpedoes during attacks by night, and were\r\neventually completely disabled. They drifted into the vicinity of Tsu\r\nIslands, where they were discovered on Sunday morning, May 28, by the\r\nauxiliary cruisers _Shilano_, _Yawata_, _Tainan_ and _Sado_, which were\r\nabout to capture them, but they all sank.\r\n\r\n\"The crews of our auxiliary cruisers rescued 915 of the crew of the\r\nsunken Russian ships.\r\n\r\n\"The battleship _Navarin_ was torpedoed four times after sundown on\r\nSaturday, May 27, and sunk. The survivors of the Navarin's crew confirm\r\nthe story of her destruction.\r\n\r\n\"The cruisers _Niitaka_ and _Otawa_ discovered the Russian cruiser\r\n_Svietlana_ at 9 o'clock on Sunday morning in the vicinity of Chappyan\r\nBay and immediately attacked and sunk her. The commander of the\r\n_Niitaka_ reports the fact.\r\n\r\n\"It is suspected that the Russian cruisers _Almaz_ and _Aurora_ were\r\nsunk by torpedoes on the night of May 27.\r\n\r\n\"The former report includes the statement that the Russian cruiser\r\n_Jemtchug_ was sunk, but as yet this remains unconfirmed, and the\r\ncruiser's name has been excluded from the revised list of Russian\r\nvessels destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"Judging from this and former reports, the enemy's main strength,\r\nconsisting of eight battleships destroyed or captured, three armored\r\ncruisers and three coast defence ships destroyed or captured, with the\r\nsecond-class cruisers and other vessels destroyed, the enemy's fighting\r\npower is thus annihilated.\r\n\r\n\"Later reports show that during the night of May 27 our torpedo boats,\r\nnumbered 34, 35 and 69, were sunk by the enemy's fire. Comrades rescued\r\nthe majority of their crews. Besides the above, there was no damage\r\nworth reporting. No warship nor destroyer suffered any loss of fighting\r\nor navigating power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Searching Sea for Remnants]\r\n\r\n\"We anticipated a heavy loss of life, but find that our casualties were\r\ncomparatively slight. They do not exceed 800 killed and wounded. The\r\ncasualty reports will be rendered as speedily as possible in order to\r\nreassure families and friends.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly the whole strength of both combatants met in battle, and the\r\narea of the fighting was very wide.\r\n\r\n\"The first day proved foggy, and even without the smoke and fumes\r\nresulting from the battle it was impossible to see five miles.\r\nConsequently, during the day it was impossible to locate or observe all\r\nthe ships under my command. Moreover, the fighting having lasted two\r\ndays, and the ships of my command being scattered for the purpose of\r\nchasing and attacking the enemy, some having received special orders\r\nafter the battle, it is impossible to collect and frame any detailed\r\nreport covering the whole battle at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Togo telegraphed, May 30, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The ships sent northward to search for Russian ships returned\r\nyesterday. The cruisers _Iwate_ and _Yakumo_ and other vessels sent\r\nsouthward to find Russian ships, returned to-day. They thoroughly\r\nsearched the Shanghai course from Tsushima and vicinity, but on both\r\nsides found no trace of the Russians.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Shimamura, on board the cruiser _Iwate_, reports:\r\n\r\n\"During the battle on May 27, at 3.07 P. M., the cruiser _Iwate_\r\nvigorously attacked the protected cruiser _Jemtchug_ at a distance of\r\n3,000 metres. The _Jemtchug_ sank in one minute. The loss of the\r\n_Jemtchug_ is, therefore, confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"During the engagement fire broke out on the _Jemtchug_ and smoke\r\nconcealed the hull of the vessel. Consequently the remainder of our\r\nfleet were unable to see the ship.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Togo gave this list of casualties, surprisingly small even to\r\nhimself, for he had estimated his losses as 800 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan's Losses Only 424 Men]\r\n\r\n\"The Japanese losses in the battle of the Sea of Japan were 113\r\nofficers and men killed and 424 officers and men wounded. The\r\ncompletion of the revised list shows that the losses were fewer than\r\nthe original estimates. The flagship _Mikasa_ was the heaviest loser,\r\nlosing 63 killed and wounded. The losses were distributed among the\r\nships of the fleet as follows: _Mikasa_, 63; _Adzuma_, 39;\r\n_Shikishima_, 37; _Asashi_, 31; _Fuji_, 28; _Idzuma_, 26; _Nisshin_,\r\n27; _Otowa_, 26; _Kasaga_, 26; _Tsushima_, 19; _Asama_, 15; _Naniwa_,\r\n17; _Tokiwa_, 15; _Yakumo_, 11; _Chitose_, 6; _Idzumi_, 10; _Kasaga_,\r\n9; _Hashidate_, 5; _Niitaka_, 4.\"\r\n\r\nThe casualties on the destroyers and the torpedo boats were 87.\r\n\r\nCommander Togo was wounded on the _Adzuma_.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Togo concluded his series of reports with this absolutely\r\naccurate statement of the ships that had escaped, in the main a\r\nremarkable feat, when the conditions of alternating fog and sunshine\r\nand the natural confusion among the Russians is taken into account.\r\n\r\n\"The Russian vessels present in the recent battle which were not sunk\r\nor captured and which are unaccounted for are,\" Togo's report adds,\r\n\"the protected cruisers _Oleg_, _Aurora_, _Izumrud_ and _Almas_, three\r\ntransports, two torpedo boat destroyers and one towboat. During the\r\nbattle the _Oleg_ and _Aurora_ were within range of our third and\r\nfourth squadrons and were on fire. They may have escaped, but it will\r\ntake time to restore their fighting power.\"\r\n\r\nA Japanese officer described the battle more connectedly in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Your Utmost for the Empire]\r\n\r\n\"At 5.30 Saturday morning a wireless message, reading, 'The enemy's\r\nsquadron is in sight,' reached the naval base. This message was\r\ntransmitted to all our ships by the flagship, with instructions to get\r\nready for action. Our squadron left their rendezvous and headed for the\r\neastern channel off Tsushima. Our men seemed to be filled with new\r\ninspiration, and were eager for the long-delayed fight to begin.\r\n\r\n\"When Tsushima was sighted to the southwest the sea was rough and the\r\ntorpedo boats were forced to run for the shelter of the island. Our\r\nthird fighting squadron, with the _Takashiho_ to port, reconnoitred the\r\nRussian course, and at 11.30 A. M. informed the main squadron by\r\nwireless telegraph that the Russian ships were passing into the east\r\nchannel, whereupon our main squadron, changing its course somewhat to\r\nthe southward, came in sight of Okinshima at 1 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. The third division arrived later and joined the main\r\nsquadron. The first and second divisions, accompanied by the destroyer\r\nflotilla, changed to a westerly course, while the third division and\r\nthe fourth destroyer flotilla headed slightly eastward.\r\n\r\n\"During the manoeuvre the Russian flagship appeared to the southward,\r\nat 1.45 o'clock. The Russians steamed up in double column. The fleet\r\nwas numerous, but no living being was visible. The Russian ships seemed\r\nto be in good order. Our ships hoisted the flag of action, the _Mikasa_\r\nsignaling: 'The defence of our empire depends upon this action. You are\r\nexpected to do your utmost.' Our men seemed to silently weigh the\r\nsignificance of this signal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Line Enveloped]\r\n\r\n\"Our first and second divisions turned to the Russians' starboard,\r\nwhile the third division kept in close touch with the preceding two\r\ndivisions. With the Japanese ships proceeding in this order, it was\r\n2.13 o'clock when the Russians opened fire. The first two shots fell\r\nshort of our line, and it was some minutes later before we commenced\r\nfiring. Then the battle was on, with firing from both sides. Our\r\ndestroyers kept on the port side of the main squadron, and in this\r\nformation we pressed the Russians against the coast of Kiushiu, and\r\nthey were obliged to change their course to the east.\r\n\r\n\"We so manoeuvred our ships as to have their bows parallel to the\r\nnorth side of the Russian line. The _Mikasa_, of our first division,\r\nwhich had been leading, changed to the rear of the line, while the\r\n_Kasuga_ headed the line. The engagement now became very fierce. The\r\n_Borodino_ was seen to be on fire. A little later the Russians headed\r\nwest, and we changed our course accordingly. Five ships of our second\r\ndivision concentrated their fire on the _Borodino_. Our first division\r\nnow began firing vigorously, proceeding parallel with the Russian line,\r\nand as we began to press against the head of the Russian line our third\r\ndivision veered to the Russian rear, thus enveloping their ships.\r\n\r\n\"The engagement proceeded hotly. Our second division followed a course\r\nparallel with the northern side of the Russians, and this movement\r\ncompleted the envelopment. The Russian ships were seen trying to break\r\nthrough, and our destroyer flotilla intercepted their new course. This\r\nstate of envelopment continued until the following day, with the ships\r\nat varying distances. Thus enclosed on all sides, the Russians were\r\nhelpless and powerless to escape the circle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destroyers Took Last Thrust.]\r\n\r\n\"Previous instructions had been given the destroyers and torpedo boats\r\nto attack the Russian ships. Following instructions, the fifth\r\ndestroyer flotilla advanced against a Russian ship, upon which the\r\nsecond division had been concentrating its fire, signaling, 'We are\r\ngoing to give the last thrust at them.'\r\n\r\n\"The Russian ship continued to fight, and seeing the approaching\r\ntorpedo boats, directed its fire on them. Undaunted, our destroyers\r\npressed forward, the _Chitose_ meantime continuing its fire. The\r\ntorpedo flotilla arrived within 200 metres of the Russian ship and the\r\n_Shiranus_ fired the first shot. Two other torpedo boats fired one\r\neach. The _Shiranus_ received two shells, but the other boats were not\r\ndamaged. The Russian ship was sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Sundown saw the battle raging furiously. Our shells were evidently\r\ntelling on the Russians, who showed signs of confusion. Our fifth\r\ntorpedo flotilla, after destroying the _Borodino_, followed in the wake\r\nof our second division, the signal reading, 'Something like the\r\nRussians' submarines have been sighted. Attack them.'\r\n\r\n\"The flotilla followed and located the object, which proved to be a\r\nsinking ship with its overturned bottom showing. Thirty survivors clung\r\nto the wreck, crying for assistance. Firing ceased with the approach of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"According to orders previously given for a torpedo attack after dark,\r\nall the destroyer flotilla, dividing into two squadrons, proceeded to\r\nattack the Russians during the whole night. The Russians frustrated the\r\nfirst and second attacks with searchlights. A third attempt was\r\ncarefully made, and the _Yugiri_ sank a ship of the _Borodino_ type,\r\nand also hit others. During the night the Russians continued to move,\r\nand we preserved our enveloping movement some distance from the Russian\r\nposition. The Russian ships headed northeast after daybreak, hoping to\r\nreach Vladivostok. Our officers and men were determined that not a ship\r\nshould escape, and resolved not to relax their efforts until they had\r\nsucceeded in either sinking or capturing every Russian ship.\r\n\r\n\"Our ships always kept ahead of the Russians. The battle was resumed at\r\n9 o'clock Sunday morning, twelve miles east of Chiyupyon Bay, and\r\nlasted all day. Here the Russians suffered their heaviest losses. They\r\nseemed unprepared to repel night attacks. During our first night attack\r\nthe Russians showed nine searchlights and frustrated the attacks, but\r\nclearly gave us the location of the fleet, which brought success later.\"\r\n\r\nStill another version has been supplied by Japanese tars, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As Sailors Saw the Battle]\r\n\r\n\"At dawn on Saturday our squadron left its rendezvous and advanced\r\nthrough the Tsushima Channel. At 2.08 in the afternoon we sighted the\r\nRussian fleet. Gradually closing in, we found the _Kniaz Souvaroff_\r\nleading the line, with the _Borodino_, the _Alexander III_, the _Orel_,\r\nthe _Osliabia_ and the _Navarin_ following in the order named. The\r\n_Nicolai I_ brought up the rear. Parallel to this line we observed five\r\ncruisers. After them came the special ships and torpedo boat\r\ndestroyers. We counted thirty-two Russian ships in all.\r\n\r\n\"Our fleet, with the battleship _Mikasa_ leading, proceeded toward the\r\nRussians in vertical line formation. The _Souvaroff_ opened fire first\r\nand then suddenly turned, reversing her course. Almost simultaneously\r\nthe _Mikasa_ opened fire with her big guns, and thus the curtain rose\r\non the great sea battle. The hostile fleets gradually closed in toward\r\neach other, exchanging a vigorous fire. The armored cruiser _Asama_\r\napproached within 3,000 metres of the Russian fleet and carefully\r\nobserved its action.\r\n\r\n\"After a short but fierce fight the _Admiral Oushakoff's_ deck was\r\nobserved to be ablaze, and the ship left the line. By 4.30 in the\r\nafternoon the Russian line was disordered and its fire slackened. The\r\n_Borodino_ and _Kamchatka_ had been disabled and soon sank. The\r\n_Borodino_ continued to fire bravely until the ship was submerged.\r\n\r\n\"The Japanese fleet continued to maintain enveloping positions from\r\nsundown until dawn. Sunday morning opened misty, but the weather soon\r\ncleared, and the search for the remnants of the Russian fleet was\r\nbegun. Five Russian ships were discovered in the vicinity of Liancourt\r\nIsland, and they were immediately surrounded. One, supposed to be the\r\n_Izumrud_, escaped at full speed. The remaining four offered no\r\nresistance, and hoisted the Japanese flag over the Russian colors,\r\napparently offering to surrender. Captain Yashiro, commanding the\r\n_Asama_, started in a small boat to ascertain the real intentions of\r\nthe Russians, when Admiral Nebogatoff lowered a boat and came on board\r\nthe _Asama_, where he formally surrendered. The prisoners were\r\ndistributed among the Japanese ships, and prize crews were selected to\r\ntake possession of the captured vessels.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Capture of Rozhdestvensky]\r\n\r\nTo have destroyed the Russian armada was, of itself, an amazing feat;\r\nbut to have captured the commander-in-chief, and to have compelled the\r\nsurrender of an admiral of the line, add vastly to the glory of Togo.\r\nThe story of Rozhdestvensky's capture is dramatic.\r\n\r\nThe destroyers, _Kasumi_, _Usugumo_, _Sazanami_ and _Kagerou_, were\r\nordered to attack the Russian warships on the night of May 27 and were\r\nsteaming ahead when they suddenly encountered a number of Russian\r\nships. The _Kasumi_ narrowly avoided a collision with a Russian\r\ncruiser, the closeness of which seems to have saved the destroyers from\r\nbeing damaged by the heavy fire which the Russians directed on them.\r\n\r\nDuring the Russian attack the vessels forming the destroyer flotilla\r\ndivided. The _Sazanami_ and _Kagerou_ continued the search for Russian\r\nships throughout the night, and in the morning discovered two torpedo\r\nboat destroyers. One of them steamed away, but the other was unable to\r\ndo so. On approaching the latter the Japanese discerned a white flag\r\nflying from the foremast and the Red Cross flag astern. She proved to\r\nbe the _Bedovi_ with Admiral Rozhdestvensky and his staff on board. The\r\n_Bedovi_ signalled that her engines were damaged, and that she was\r\nshort of coal and water. An armed guard was sent on board the _Bedovi_\r\nto receive her surrender. The Russians requested the Japanese not to\r\nremove Admiral Rozhdestvensky and the other officers on account of\r\ntheir wounds, and the Japanese complied, with the understanding that\r\nthe guard would shoot Rozhdestvensky in the event of the delay leading\r\nto a meeting with Russian ships, thus running the danger of his\r\nrecapture. The _Sazanami_ ran a line to the _Bedovi_ and began to wing\r\nher. The line parted twice. In the morning the _Sazanami_ met the\r\nJapanese cruiser _Akashi_, which convoyed the two destroyers to Sasebo.\r\nDuring the trip the destroyers encountered heavy seas, and their decks\r\nwere awash during part of the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chiefs of Japan's Fleet]\r\n\r\nThirty naval commanders participated in the battle of the Japan Sea.\r\nVice Admiral Togo was commander-in-chief, leading the first squadron.\r\nVice Admiral Kamamura was in command of the second squadron, and Rear\r\nAdmiral Kataoka led the third squadron.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of staff in the order named were Admiral Kato and Captains\r\nFujii and Saito. The commanders of the squadron divisions were Vice\r\nAdmirals Dewa, Uriu and Mitsu, acting as rear admirals under Vice\r\nAdmiral Togo, Captains Yamada, Shimamura, Taketomi and Kokura.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blowing Up the Izumrud]\r\n\r\nThe fate of the cruiser _Izumrud_ is a chapter of itself in the story\r\nof the battle. Baron Ferzen, her captain, with survivors of the ship's\r\ncrew, reached Vladivostok on June 1 and sent a report, which, in\r\naddition to confirming the disaster to the entire fleet, told the fate\r\nof his own ship. The Baron reported that before dark, on May 27, the\r\n_Osliabya_, _Alexander III_ and _Borodino_ had been sunk, and the\r\n_Kniaz Souvaroff_, the _Kamtchatka and_ the _Urel_ had been seriously\r\ndamaged and were lost to sight. The command then devolved on Rear\r\nAdmiral Nebogatoff.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the _Nikolai I_, the _Orel_, the _General Admiral\r\nApraxine_, the _Admiral Seniavin_, the _Admiral Oughakoff_, the _Sissoi\r\nVeliky_, the _Nevarin_, the _Admiral Nakhimoff_, and the _Izumrud_\r\nsailed northeastward, the latter being charged to transmit orders to\r\nthe battleships. Two other cruisers were cut off from the fleet and\r\nwere not again seen.\r\n\r\nThe battleships, steaming at fourteen knots, were repeatedly attacked\r\nby the Japanese torpedo boats, especially at the extremities of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nAt dawn it was ascertained that the battleship division consisted of\r\nthe _Nikolai I_, the _Orel_, the _General Admiral Apraxine_ and the\r\n_Admiral Seniavin_.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, May 28, smoke from the Japanese ships reappeared on the\r\nhorizon, whereupon the admiral gave orders for increased speed. The\r\n_Admiral Seniavin_ and the _General Admiral Apraxine_ dropped behind.\r\n\r\nToward 10 o'clock, the Japanese fleet appeared first to port and then\r\nto starboard, while the cruiser division manoeuvred behind the\r\nRussians to starboard. Baron Ferzen's account continues:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight Ends in Disaster]\r\n\r\n\"I was cut off from the squadron and finding it impossible to rejoin it\r\nresolved to make for Vladivostok. I put on full speed and the enemy's\r\ncruisers came on in pursuit. Owing to the insufficiency of my coal\r\nsupply and the certainty of meeting the enemy's cruisers, I\r\nsubsequently altered my course for Vladimir Bay, where I arrived on the\r\nnight of May 29. At 1.30 o'clock next morning, in pitch darkness, the\r\n_Izumrud_ ran full on a reef at the entrance of the bay. Having only\r\nten tons of coal and seeing that it would be impossible to again float\r\nmy vessel, I ordered the crew ashore and blew up the _Izumrud_ to\r\nprevent her falling into the hands of the enemy. Ten of my sailors were\r\nwounded in the battle, but the officers and the rest of the crew are\r\nall safe.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The News Reaches Russia]\r\n\r\nIntimations of the extent of the disaster first reached Russia through\r\nforeign telegrams. The emperor and naval officials hoped against hope\r\nthat their own advices would bring some ray of comfort. It was hoped\r\nthat a portion of the fleet might reach Vladivostok strong enough to\r\naid in protecting the fortress against attack from the sea.\r\n\r\nOne unprotected cruiser and three torpedo boat destroyers were all of\r\nthe splendid fleet that ever were to reach Vladivostok. The cruiser\r\n_Almaz_, which by reason of her lack of protective sheathing had been\r\nordered by Rozhdestvensky to flee in event of battle, got through the\r\nJapanese lines with a minimum of damage, though well scarred by shots\r\nthat had reached her by chance. Captain Chagir, her commander, speedily\r\ncommunicated with the emperor at St. Petersburg through Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Linevitch, commander-in-chief in the Far East. This was the\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n\"The cruiser _Almaz_ has arrived at Vladivostok. Her commander reports\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"'On May 27, Vice Admiral Rozhdestvensky's fleet in the Tsu Strait\r\nengaged the Japanese in battle. During the day we lost the battleships\r\n_Kniaz Souvaroff_, _Borodino_, _Osliabya_, and the cruiser _Ural_. The\r\nbattleship _Alexander III_ was seriously damaged at the start of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\"'After the separation of the cruiser _Almaz_ from the fleet the battle\r\nwas renewed in the darkness. The result of the night battle is not\r\nknown.'\"\r\n\r\nThe _Almaz_ was cut off from the fleet and reached Vladivostok.\r\n\r\n\"Supplementary reports of the commander of the _Almaz_, forwarded by\r\nthe post commandant at Vladivostok, state that the transport\r\n_Kamtchatka_ was seriously damaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Almaz_ had Lieutenant Mochalin and four sailors killed and ten\r\nsailors wounded. There is no news as to those who were saved or those\r\nwho perished on the sunken warships.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the _Almaz_ has thus been described by an eye witness at\r\nVladivostok:\r\n\r\nThe _Almaz_, which arrived at her anchorage here Monday evening, May\r\n29, bore scars of the battle. Her mizzen mast was shot away, and one of\r\nher smokestacks was pierced by a cannon shot. But the _Grozny_, though\r\nengaged for several hours in a running fight at short range with a\r\nlarge Japanese destroyer, showed no signs of the fray. After her\r\ncommander, Captain Andriffski, had been wounded, and an officer and\r\nthree men had been killed, the _Grozny_ succeeded in sinking her\r\nopponent with a luckily placed shot, and reached Vladivostok without\r\nfurther adventure.\r\n\r\nFor two days Vladivostok had been buzzing with rumor and excitement.\r\nThe fact that a battle between the rival fleets was imminent, if\r\nRozhdestvensky was not already at hand-grips with Togo, was made known\r\nthrough telegrams from Europe, and when it was learned Monday morning\r\nthat a Russian cruiser had been sighted off Askold Island, headed for\r\nthe harbor, the city was filled with the wildest reports of every\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Story of Russian Survivors]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants clustered in the streets, thronged the waterside or\r\nclimbed the frowning hills overlooking the harbor for a better view.\r\nFinally, toward 6 o'clock in the evening, a graceful cruiser with two\r\nsnowy-white stacks, shot in view at the entrance to the Golden Horn and\r\nrounded to an anchorage beneath the bristling guns of the curving\r\npromontory. From afar the broken stump of her mizzen-mast and a shot\r\nhole showing black upon the white paint of one stack indicated that the\r\ncruiser had encountered the Japanese. As the anchor chain rattled in\r\nthe hawse holes the vessel wreathed itself in smoke--it was an\r\nadmiral's salute in honor of Rear Admiral Von Jessen. Scarcely had the\r\nboom of the last cannon begun to echo from the surrounding hills when\r\nVon Jessen's flagship, the cruiser _Rossia_, answered the salute, and a\r\nminute later the guns of the fortress took up the cannonade.\r\n\r\nExcitement beyond description seized the thronging spectators, who,\r\nwith frantic \"huzzas,\" tossed high their caps.\r\n\r\nCitizens embraced each other and danced jubilantly upon the pier, while\r\nthe crews of the ships in the harbor joined in wild cheering.\r\n\r\nIn a thrice the boats were dropped from the davits, and in a moment the\r\nofficers of the cruisers and torpedo boats in the harbor and the\r\nmilitary officials from the fortress were swarming on board the _Almaz_\r\nto learn news of the fight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saw Flagship Go Down]\r\n\r\nThe story was short. According to the officers of the _Almaz_, the\r\nfleet under Rozhdestvensky met the Japanese in the Straits of Korea,\r\nnear Tsu Island, and the opposing fleets immediately closed in.\r\n\r\nBeing lightly armored, the _Almaz_, as had been expected by Admiral\r\nRozhdestvensky before the battle, separated itself from the main fleet\r\nat the first opportunity and headed for Vladivostok soon after the\r\ncommencement of the action, but not too soon to observe that the losses\r\non both sides in the titanic combat were great.\r\n\r\nEarly in the battle an officer of the _Almaz_, while watching\r\nRozhdestvensky's flagship, the battleship _Kniaz Souvaroff_, for a\r\nsignal, saw the flagship shudder from stem to stern, as if under a blow\r\nfrom a gigantic hammer, and hesitate in her course, while the waves\r\nrose high from her armored sides. Then she commenced to list and sink.\r\n\r\nThe officers believe that the debut of the submarine boat as an\r\neffective agent in naval warfare, or perhaps a large mine caused the\r\ndisaster to the _Kniaz Souvaroff_. The damage, however, was so\r\nextensive that the flagship soon went down, leaving the deck officers\r\nand many of the crew struggling in the waves.\r\n\r\nOne of the Russian torpedo boats, either the destroyer _Buiny_ or the\r\n_Bravi_, ran in and picked up a number of the swimmers, one of whom was\r\nrecognized through a glass as Admiral Rozhdestvensky.\r\n\r\nUnder a grueling attack by the Japanese warships, aided by torpedo\r\nboats, mines and submarines, the _Borodino_, _Osliabia_ and _Ural_ were\r\nplaced out of action and followed the flagship to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe fog, which had raised and lowered intermittently during the\r\nmorning, began to settle down again, and the distance of the _Almaz_,\r\nwhich now succeeded in disengaging herself in the combat from the\r\nstruggling ships, made it difficult for her to see clearly.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the _Grozny_ on the following day was marked by the same\r\nscenes of excitement as those which characterized the advent of the\r\n_Almaz_. The wounded commander of the destroyer, Captain Andriffski,\r\nconfirmed the details given by the officers of the _Almaz_. He\r\ndescribed his combat as a running fight, in which the _Grozny_ was\r\nengaged for several hours, finally sinking the pursuing Japanese\r\ndestroyer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian Story of Disaster]\r\n\r\nFrom this and further fragmentary reports the Russians pieced together\r\na story of the disaster. They figure that Admiral Togo, with his main\r\nsquadron, must have lain somewhere off the coast of Korea, while\r\nAdmirals Kamimura and Uriu held their squadrons further north to head\r\noff the Russian vessels which might get through Togo's lines or be\r\nprepared to bar the entrance to the Straits of Tsugaru in case the\r\nRussians should be reported moving up the east coast of Japan. When\r\nTogo's scouts reported that Admiral Rozhdestvensky was heading for the\r\neastern channel of the Straits of Korea the Japanese Admiral steamed\r\naround the northern part of the Tsu Islands, and came upon the Russians\r\nsteaming in double column, with the cruisers to port.\r\n\r\nTogo enjoyed the great advantage of tactical position when he opened\r\nfire, having the lightest of the Russian ships between him and\r\nRozhdestvensky's heavier vessels, thus smothering the fire of the\r\nlatter. Besides, Togo was able to use all his broadsides, whereas the\r\nsternmost ships of the Russian columns, coming on in line ahead\r\nformation, could probably only with difficulty use any guns at all.\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday morning came the Russian fleet was divided. The faster and\r\nstronger division, under Rozhdestvensky, was met by Kamimura and Uriu,\r\nwhile the slower division, under Nebogatoff, renewed the fight with\r\nTogo. With some of the scattered Russian units it was a case of save\r\nhimself who can. In the running fight the Japanese enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of superior speed, enabling them to concentrate their fire\r\nand bring every crippled Russian ship to bay. Admiral Nebogatoff's\r\nbattered remnant surrendered off Liancourt Rocks, while Rozhdestvensky,\r\nwith the best remaining battleships, fought on for the honor of the\r\nRussian navy.\r\n\r\nTorpedo attacks were the feature of the Japanese program, which more\r\nsurely than anything else brought disaster. Torpedo boats in night\r\nattacks launched their deadly missiles within a hundred yards of their\r\nRussian targets. They completely encircled the Russian ships, swarming\r\nlike angry hornets. Much of the sweeping character of the victory will\r\nultimately be traced to these comparatively tiny craft, fighting under\r\nthe shower of shells being hurled from the big guns of the battleships\r\nand cruisers far away.\r\n\r\nSummarizing scattered reports, the results of the battle may be\r\naccurately stated to be annihilation for Russian sea power in the Far\r\nEast. Thirty-seven Russian warships of all classes entered the Korean\r\nStraits. Of these, three, a cruiser, and two destroyers, reached\r\nVladivostok; three armored cruisers reached Manila; two battleships and\r\ntwo coast defence ships were captured and were taken to Sasebo; one\r\ndestroyer, found helpless at sea, was towed to Shanghai; leaving a\r\ntotal of twenty-six ships that were sent to the bottom, five of them\r\nbattleships. The Russian loss in life reached a total of 6,500 men, one\r\nadmiral and ten captains among them. The loss to Russia in gold\r\namounted to $75,000,000. Japan's loss in ships was three torpedo boats\r\nand a few more than 400 men. Experts the world around failed to find\r\nadequate explanation for this amazing disparity. As summarized at\r\nTokio, these are reasons which in part contributed to Admiral\r\nRozhdestvensky's defeat:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Russians Were Defeated]\r\n\r\n\"First. An imperfect reconnaissance and incomplete, faulty and\r\nmisleading intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Second. An imperfect battle formation, which indicated that\r\nRozhdestvensky did not expect to meet Togo off Tsushima.\r\n\r\n\"Third. The weather, the direction of the wind and the sunlight were\r\nunfavorable to the Russians, Togo having the sun behind him and firing\r\nwith the wind, while the Russians had the sunlight in their eyes and\r\nfired against the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. The Russians wasted their ammunition and eventually their\r\nsupply ran short. It is believed that the surrender of Nebogatoff was\r\nnecessary because his ammunition had been expended.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth. The marked inferiority of the Russian gunnery.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan Honors Togo]\r\n\r\nJapan hailed Togo as the nation's hero.

Russia stood before the world in the\r\nlight of a thoroughly vanquished nation. On land her armies had been\r\ninvariably defeated in a series of battles of stupendous magnitude. Her\r\noriginal Asiatic fleet had been annihilated. Her last great effort to\r\nstem the victories of Japan, the sending of a vast Armada to the\r\nOrient, had resulted in complete annihilation of that fleet. The\r\nnations forgot to grieve for the thousands slain in the hope that this\r\nlast crowning disaster to Russia would bring what every civilized land\r\nhad desired for months--an end to the titanic war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Takes Initiative]\r\n\r\nWhile this was the universal wish it remained for the President of the\r\nUnited States to take the initiative. The fact that, with the exception\r\nof a minor campaign for the possession of the Island of Saghalien, off\r\nthe Siberian coast, this was really the closing chapter of the war, has\r\nadded a brilliant feat to the annals of American diplomatic\r\nachievements and has placed the name of Theodore Roosevelt eternally\r\namong those of the famous benefactors of humanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese Take Saghalien]\r\n\r\nAs has been said, one minor martial enterprise remained for the\r\nJapanese. Saghalien Island, blanketing the coasts of Siberia for a\r\ndistance of 700 miles, had been secured by Russia from Japan by a\r\ntreaty partaking, it was claimed by the Japanese, the nature of a\r\ncoercive measure. Among the objects for which the Japanese had entered\r\nupon the war were to secure permanent fishing rights in the waters\r\nalong the Siberian coast and the recession of Saghalien Island to her.\r\nThe seizure of this Island, too, was a necessary corollary of a land\r\nand sea campaign against Vladivostock, which would have been the next\r\nstep in her military campaign had not the war come to an end. There was\r\nlittle surprise, therefore, when the Tokio government, while giving\r\nconsent to a proposal that the belligerent nations meet to talk of\r\npeace, refused to consent to an armistice. Possession of Saghalien\r\nIsland was still to be gained. The Japanese campaign began when a\r\nlanding was effected on the East coast of the Island on July 8. The\r\nRussian garrison numbered 8,000 men and while there were defensive\r\nworks of some strength at a number of points, the defenders were\r\nhelpless before the advance of the invaders. The campaign amounted to a\r\nhalf dozen engagements, mere skirmishes, when compared with the battles\r\nof the Manchurian campaign. The Russians made a brave defence, but lost\r\nposition after position and the subjugation of the Island was completed\r\non July 30, when the Russian Governor and 3,500 men surrendered \"in the\r\nname of humanity.\" Five days previously the Japanese had occupied\r\nAlexandrovsk, the chief town of the Island and co-operative naval\r\nforces were disposed so that the escape of the garrison from the Island\r\nto the mainland was impossible. The slaughter of the entire force of\r\nthe defenders could have been the only result of continued resistance.\r\nThe Japanese announced the organization of a civil administration of\r\nthe Island the moment the surrender had been completed, and were thus\r\nin possession of what was actually Russian territory. This fact was\r\nimportant to the Japanese from several standpoints. The Island is rich\r\nin minerals, it is the centre of the vast fishing industry of the North\r\nPacific and has strategic value on account of its position with regard\r\nto the entire Siberian littoral. More important than any of these\r\ncircumstances, however, was the fact that it had been soil over which\r\nflew the Russian flag. The Japanese contemplated making a demand for\r\nindemnity at the forthcoming peace conference. Precedent demanded that\r\nthere should have been the occupation of territory to make valid such a\r\nclaim. The occupation of Saghalien gave this necessary basis for the\r\nindemnity demand which, ultimately was presented and only withdrawn\r\nwhen it became apparent that the war must go on unless Japan withdrew\r\nher claim.\r\n\r\nBut the conquest of Saghalien marked the last of actual warfare between\r\nJapan and Russia. President Roosevelt had sent an identical note to\r\nJapan and Russia on June 8, calling upon each, in the name of humanity,\r\nto meet to discuss terms of peace and the whole Saghalien campaign had\r\ngone on while, following this request, diplomatic machinery had been\r\nslowly at work preparing the way for the peace conference. The rest of\r\nthe story of the Japan-Russia War has to do with the events which\r\nfinally called permanent truce to the long struggle and caused a\r\nmillion fighting men and their auxiliaries to turn their faces from the\r\nrugged plains of Manchuria, where thousands on thousands had given\r\ntheir lives for their Emperors and their Fatherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparing for Peace Parleys]\r\n\r\nRussia's acceptance of the President's invitation reached Washington on\r\nJune 12, two days after Japan had announced her assent. A ripple was\r\ncaused by difficulty in choosing a place for the meeting. Russia\r\npreferred an European capital. Japan would not consent to any that\r\ncould be named. Russia ultimately yielded the point, and on June 15,\r\nwith the consent of both of the belligerents, Washington was named, and\r\na day within the first ten days of August was accepted for the\r\nassembling of the envoys. The Czar named Sergius Witte, greatest\r\nstatesman of the Empire, to head the peace delegation, with Baron\r\nRosen, Russian ambassador at Washington, as his associate. The Mikado\r\nnamed Baron Komura as chief of the Japanese delegation, and as his\r\nassociate, Mr. Takahira, Japanese Minister to the United States.\r\nAccompanying each was a suite of a dozen secretarys, legal and military\r\nexperts and interpreters. On July 11, the President named Portsmouth,\r\nN. H., Navy Yard as the actual place of meeting. It was feared that\r\nWashington, under the torrid conditions usually prevailing there in\r\nmid-summer, would prove a too uncomfortable place for the guests of the\r\nnation to spend the weeks that must necessarily be consumed in the\r\nnegotiations. The Japanese envoys and their suite reached New York on\r\nJuly 25. M. Witte, the chief Russian envoy, arrived in New York with\r\nhis suite on August 2, and was joined by Baron Rosen, his associate.\r\nBoth the Japanese and the Russian delegations were informally presented\r\nto the President at his summer home at Oyster Bay, N. Y., prior to the\r\nformal reception of the two peace missions which took place on the\r\nPresident's yacht, the Mayflower, in Oyster Bay on August 5. The\r\nPresident, in a toast to which no reply was given, expressed the hope\r\nthat a \"just and lasting peace\" might be arranged. The envoys and their\r\nsuites were conveyed in warships to Portsmouth, reaching that city on\r\nAugust 7. The envoys were formally welcomed by United States officials\r\nand the Governor of the State of New Hampshire. The Hotel Wentworth, on\r\nan island off the mainland was made their place of residence. The newly\r\nconstructed general stores building in the Navy Yard, which had been\r\nelaborately fitted up with every possible convenience, was designated\r\nas the scene of the sessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Japanese Terms]\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the envoys was held on August 9. The Japanese\r\nterms were presented in twelve sections, as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Recognition of Japan's \"preponderating influence\" in Korea.\r\n\r\nII. Mutual obligations to evacuate Manchuria, Russia to retrocede to\r\nChina all special privileges.\r\n\r\nIII. Japanese obligations to restore the sovereignty and administration\r\nof China in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nIV. Mutual obligations to respect the territorial and administrative\r\nintegrity of China and the principle of the \"open door.\"\r\n\r\nV. The cession of the Island of Saghalien.\r\n\r\nVI. The surrender of the Russian leases in the Liaotung Peninsula,\r\nincluding Port Arthur, Dalny and the Blonde and Elliott Islands.\r\n\r\nVII. The cession of the branch of the Chinese Eastern Railroad from\r\nHarbin southward.\r\n\r\nVIII. The retention by Russia of that portion of the railroad line\r\nthrough northern Manchuria connecting the Transsiberian road with\r\nVladivostock.\r\n\r\nIX. The reimbursement of Japan for the war--commonly spoken of as the\r\nindemnity.\r\n\r\nX. The surrender of Russian warships which have been interned in\r\nneutral ports during the war.\r\n\r\nXI. The limitation of Russia's naval forces in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nXII. The question of fishing rights of Russia and Japan off the\r\nSiberian coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japan Makes Peace Possible]\r\n\r\nThese demands, one by one, were discussed by the envoys. It developed\r\nthat Russia absolutely refused to grant an indemnity, to surrender\r\nwarships interned in Chinese and American ports, or to cede to Japan\r\nthe Island of Saghalien. Whatever hope of compromise there seemed to be\r\nwith regard to the other questions at issue it was regarded as\r\nabsolutely essential to the signing of a treaty of peace that Russia\r\nshould yield on the subject of indemnity. The President's efforts were\r\ndirected toward accomplishing this result under some other name than\r\nindemnity. It was proposed to arrange for the payment of the amount\r\ndemanded as a purchase price for Saghalien, or for the railway rights\r\nover which Japan had become master. No compromise would be listened to\r\nby the Czar, \"Not a kopeck for indemnity,\" was the phrase of M. Witte,\r\nand there was no yielding. By shrewd diplomatic manoeuvring the\r\nRussian envoy had placed Japan in a position which meant that were the\r\nwar to be continued it would be upon the responsibility of Japan and\r\nfor the sole reason that money must be had. The Tokio government, after\r\nlong discussion, decided upon a magnanimous course, which at once won\r\nthe encomiums of the whole civilized world. She yielded every point in\r\ndispute, gave up her demand for indemnity, gave up half of Saghalien,\r\ngave up her claim upon the interned warships and, though triumphantly\r\nvictorious in every step of the war, accepted terms of peace dictated\r\nby the nation she had conquered, and this \"in the name of humanity.\"\r\nRussia had won the victory on the face of it, but the historian will\r\ncredit to Japan the greater and the real victory, a victory of vast\r\nmoral and humanitarian significance.\r\n\r\nThe glad news went out to the world on August 29, that the envoys had\r\nagreed upon every point and that a treaty of peace would forthwith be\r\ndrafted. To Prof. Maartens, the famous authority of international law\r\nand to Mr. Dennison, an American, long an adviser of the Japanese\r\nForeign Office, was assigned the task of actually drafting the treaty\r\nin accord with the general agreement that had been reached by the\r\nenvoys. Their work was speedily accomplished and the \"Treaty of\r\nPortsmouth\" brought to an end this struggle that had cost hundreds of\r\nthousands of lives, billions of dollars and had completely changed the\r\nstatus of political power in the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace was finally signed at Portsmouth, N. H., on\r\nSeptember 5, 1905; Sergius Witte and Baron Rosen signed for Russia,\r\nwhile Baron Komura and Mr. Takahira signed for Japan. It was signed by\r\nthe Emperors of Russia and Japan and made public October 16, 1905.\r\n\r\n                          TEXT OF THE TREATY.\r\n\r\nThe text of the treaty is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Japan, on the one part, and the Emperor of all the\r\nRussias, on the other part, animated by a desire to restore the\r\nblessings of peace to their countries, have resolved to conclude\r\na treaty of peace, and have for this purpose named their\r\nplenipotentiaries, that is to say, for his Majesty the Emperor of\r\nJapan, Baron Komura Jutaro, Jusami, Grand Cordon of the Imperial\r\nOrder of the Rising Sun, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, and\r\nhis Excellency, Takahira Kogoro, Imperial Order of the Sacred\r\nTreasure, his Minister to the United States, and his Majesty the\r\nEmperor of all the Russias his Excellency Sergius Witte, his\r\nSecretary of State and President of the Committee of Ministers of\r\nthe Empire of Russia, and his Excellency Baron Roman Rosen,\r\nMaster of the Imperial Court of Russia, his Majesty's Ambassador\r\nto the United States, who, after having exchanged their full\r\npowers, which were found to be in good and due form, have\r\nconcluded the following articles:\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nThere shall henceforth be peace and amity between their Majesties the\r\nEmperor of Japan and the Emperor of all the Russias, and between their\r\nrespective States and subjects.\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE II.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Russian Government, acknowledging that Japan possesses in\r\nKorea paramount political, military and economical interests, engages\r\nneither to obstruct nor interfere with measures for guidance,\r\nprotection and control which the Imperial Government of Japan may find\r\nnecessary to take in Korea.
