WILLIAM M. THAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember, that, in the preface of \"THE PRINTER BOY,\" I\r\npromised the next volume should be \"THE FARMER BOY; OR, HOW GEORGE\r\nWASHINGTON BECAME PRESIDENT.\" That pledge has never been redeemed,\r\nthough some labor has been performed with reference to it. And now\r\nProvidence seems to direct the fulfilment of the promise by the pen of\r\nanother, soon to be well known, I doubt not, to thousands of young\r\nreaders;--\"Uncle Juvinell.\"\r\n\r\nThe advance sheets of a volume from his pen, upon the early life of\r\nWashington, have been placed in my hands for examination. I have\r\ncarefully perused the work, and find it to be of so high a character,\r\nand so well adapted to the exigencies of the times, that I voluntarily\r\nabandon the idea of preparing the proposed volume myself, and most\r\ncordially recommend this work to the youth of our beloved land. I take\r\nthis step with all the more readiness, when I learn that the author\r\nhas persevered in his labors, though totally blind and almost deaf;\r\nand I gladly transfer the title which I proposed to give my own book\r\nto his excellent work, well satisfied that the act will prove a public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find that Mr. Heady (Uncle Juvinell) has produced a\r\nvery entertaining and instructive volume. It is written in a racy,\r\nsprightly style, that cannot fail to captivate the mind. Partaking\r\nhimself of the buoyancy and good humor of boyhood, the author is able\r\nto write for the boys in a manner that is at once attractive and\r\nprofitable. He has written a live book of one, who, \"though dead, yet\r\nspeaketh.\" It is replete with facts, and lessons of wisdom. The\r\nvirtues are taught both by precept and example, and the vices are held\r\nup in all their deformity to warn and save. Religion, too, receives\r\nits just tribute, and wears the crown of glory.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this volume is timely. Adapted as it is to magnify\r\nthe patriotic virtues, and the priceless worth of the government under\r\nwhich we live, it will prove a valuable contribution to the juvenile\r\nliterature of the land. In this period of mighty struggles and issues,\r\nwhen our nation is groaning and travailing in pain to bring forth a\r\nfuture of surpassing renown and grandeur, it is important to inspire\r\nthe hearts of American youth by the noblest examples of patriotism and\r\nvirtue. And such is WASHINGTON, the \"Father of his Country.\" It is\r\nbest that the young of this battling age should study his character\r\nand emulate his deeds. His life was the richest legacy that he could\r\nleave to unborn generations, save the glorious Republic that he\r\nfounded; and well will it be for the youth of our country when that\r\nlife becomes to them the stimulus to exalted aims. Then loyalty will\r\nbe free as air, and rebellions be unknown; then treason will hide its\r\nhydra-head, and our insulted flag wave in triumph where the last chain\r\nof slavery is broken.\r\n\r\nThis volume will do its part to hasten this consummation of our\r\npatriot-hopes. Over its pleasant pages, then, we extend the right hand\r\nof fellowship to its author, though a stranger to us. Long may his\r\nable pen hold out! Widely may this his last work circulate! Blessed\r\nmay be the fruits!\r\n\r\n  W. M. T.\r\n\r\n  FRANKLIN, MASS., October, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur beloved country, my dear young readers, has passed through one\r\ngreat revolution; and it is now in the midst of another, which\r\npromises to prove even more momentous in its consequences.\r\n\r\nKnowing, therefore, the deep and lasting impression the great events\r\nof the day must needs produce upon your opening minds, the author of\r\nthis book has been casting about him how he might contribute to your\r\nand the nation's good. As he is altogether bereft of sight, and nearly\r\nso of hearing, he is, of course, unable to lift a hand in his\r\ncountry's defence, or raise his voice in her justification. But she\r\nhas a future; and for that he entertains an earnest hope, that through\r\nyou, the rising generation, he may do something.\r\n\r\nTo this end, therefore, he has written this volume, wherein he has\r\nendeavored to set forth, in a manner more calculated to attract and\r\nimpress the youthful mind than has perhaps been heretofore attempted,\r\nthe life and character of our good and great George Washington.\r\n\r\nBy so doing, he hopes to awaken in your minds a desire to imitate the\r\nexample and emulate the virtues of this greatest and wisest of\r\nAmericans. For should he succeed in this, and thereby influence a\r\nthousand of you, when arrived at man's estate, to remain loyal to your\r\ncountry in her hour of peril (who might else have been tempted to turn\r\ntheir hand against her), then shall his humble pen have done more for\r\nher future welfare than he could have done for her present\r\ndeliverance, had he the wielding of a thousand swords.\r\n\r\nAnd, should he ever have reason to suppose that such were really the\r\ncase, far happier would he be, even in the dark and silent depths of\r\nhis solitude, than the renowned victor of a hundred battle-fields, in\r\nall the blaze and noise of popular applause. Hoping that this little\r\nbook may, for your sakes, fulfil the object for which it was written,\r\nand prove but the beginning of a long and pleasant acquaintance, he\r\nwill conclude by begging to subscribe himself your true friend and\r\nwell-wisher,\r\n\r\n  MORRISON HEADY.\r\n\r\n  ELK CREEK, SPENCER COUNTY, KY., 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Introduction_                                                    17\r\n\r\n  WHEREIN IT WILL APPEAR WHO UNCLE JUVINELL IS, AND HOW HE CAME TO\r\n  WRITE THE LIFE OF \"THE FARMER BOY\" FOR THE LITTLE FOLKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  _George at School_                                                35\r\n\r\n  IN WHICH THE YOUNG READER WILL FIND SOME ACCOUNT OF THE BIRTH,\r\n  CHILDHOOD, AND EARLY EDUCATION OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, AND THE\r\n  STORY OF HIS LITTLE HATCHET; FROM WHICH HE MAY DRAW A WHOLESOME\r\n  MORAL, IF HE BE DESIROUS OF GROWING IN VIRTUE; TOGETHER WITH\r\n  OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE HARDLY TO BE FOUND\r\n  ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  _The First Sorrow_                                                46\r\n\r\n  SHOWING HOW GEORGE MET WITH THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE\r\n  IN THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER; AND HOW HIS MOTHER WAS LEFT A YOUNG\r\n  WIDOW, WITH THE CARE OF A LARGE FAMILY; WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE\r\n  PRUDENCE AND WISDOM SUE DISPLAYED IN THE REARING OF HER\r\n  CHILDREN; TOGETHER WITH THE STORY OF THE SORREL COLT, WHICH\r\n  UNCLE JUVINELL INTRODUCES BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THE CHARACTERS\r\n  OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  _Playing Soldier_                                                 54\r\n\r\n  WHEREIN THE YOUNG READER WILL FIND HOW GEORGE FIGURED AS A\r\n  LITTLE SOLDIER AT SCHOOL; WITH SOME REMARKS TOUCHING HIS\r\n  WONDERFUL STRENGTH AND ACTIVITY OF BODY, AND COURAGE OF SPIRIT;\r\n  AND HOW HE WOULD HAVE FIGURED AS A LITTLE SAILOR, HAD HE NOT\r\n  BEEN PREVENTED BY A MOTHER'S ANXIOUS LOVE; WHICH INFLUENCED NOT\r\n  ONLY THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS FUTURE LIFE, BUT ALSO THE DESTINY\r\n  OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY, AND, IT MAY BE, THAT OF THE WHOLE WORLD;\r\n  AS THE LITTLE READER WILL FIND OUT FOR HIMSELF.

Just as the last beam of the setting sun went out at the\r\nwindow, Uncle Juvinell, as if to fill its place, came in at the door,\r\nall brisk and ruddy from his tramp over the snow in the sharp bracing\r\nair, and was hailed with a joyous shout by the little folks, who,\r\nhastening to wheel his great arm-chair for him round to the fire,\r\npushed and pulled him into it, and called upon him to tell one of his\r\nmost charming stories, even before the tingling frost was out of his\r\nnose.\r\n\r\nAs this worthy old gentleman has done much for the entertainment and\r\ninstruction of the rising generations of the land, it is but due him\r\nthat some mention, touching his many amiable traits of character and\r\nhis accomplishments of mind and person, should be made in this place\r\nfor the more complete satisfaction of those who may hereafter feel\r\nthemselves indebted to him for some of the most pleasant moments of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nIn person, Uncle Juvinell is stout and well-rounded. His legs are fat,\r\nand rather short; his body is fat, and rather long; his belly is snug\r\nand plump; his hands are plump and white; his hair is white and soft;\r\nhis eyes are soft and blue; his coat is blue and sleek; and over his\r\nsleek and dimpled face, from his dimpled chin to the very crown of his\r\nhead,--which, being bald, shines like sweet oil in a warm\r\nfire-light,--there beams one unbroken smile of fun, good-humor, and\r\nlove, that fills one's heart with sunshine to behold. Indeed, to look\r\nat him, and be with him a while, you could hardly help half believing\r\nthat he must be a twin-brother of Santa Claus, so closely does he\r\nresemble that far-famed personage, not only in appearance, but in\r\ncharacter also; and more than once, having been met in his little\r\nsleigh by some belated school-boy, whistling homeward through the\r\ntwilight of a Christmas or New Year's Eve, he has been mistaken for\r\nthe jolly old saint himself. In short, his whole appearance is in the\r\nhighest degree respectable; and there is even about him an air of\r\nold-fashioned elegance, which of course is owing chiefly to the\r\nnatural sweetness and politeness of his manners, and yet perhaps a\r\nlittle heightened withal by the gold-bowed spectacles that he wears on\r\nhis nose, the heavy gold bar that pins his snowy linen, the gold\r\nbuttons that shine on his coat, his massive gold watch-chain (at the\r\nend of which hangs a great red seal as big as a baby's fist), and by\r\nhis gold-headed ebony cane, that he always carries on his shoulder\r\nlike a musket when he walks, as much as to say, \"Threescore and ten,\r\nand no need of a staff yet, my Christian friend.\" No man is more\r\nbeloved and esteemed by all who know him, old and young, than he; for\r\nlike Father Grimes, whose nephew he is by the mother's side.--\r\n\r\n    \"He modest merit seeks to find,\r\n      And give it its desert;\r\n    He has no malice in his mind,\r\n      No ruffles on his shirt.\r\n\r\n    His neighbors he does not abuse;\r\n      Is sociable and gay:\r\n    He wears large buckles in his shoes,\r\n      And changes them, each day.\"\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing about Uncle Juvinell that we might venture to\r\npronounce more charming than another, it is the smile of mingled fun,\r\ngood-humor, and love, with which his countenance never ceases to\r\nshine, save when he hears the voice of pain and his breast with pity\r\nburns. Touching this same trait of his, a lady once said in our\r\nhearing, that she verily believed a cherub, fresh from the rosy\r\nchambers of the morning, came at the opening of each day to Uncle\r\nJuvinell's chamber, just on purpose to dash a handful of sunbeams on\r\nhis head; and, as there were always more than enough to keep his face\r\nbathed with smiles for the next twenty-four hours, they were not\r\nwasted, but, falling and lodging on his gold spectacles, his gold\r\nbreast-pin, his gold buttons, his gold watch-chain, and the gold head\r\nof his ebony cane, washed them with lustre ever new, as if his face,\r\nbright and broad as it was, were not enough to reflect the love and\r\nsunshine ever dwelling in his heart. We will not undertake to vouch\r\nfor the truth of this, however. As the young lady was a marriageable\r\nyoung lady, and had been for a number of years, it would not be\r\ngallant or generous for us to mention it; but of this we are certain,\r\nthat, when this good old gentleman enters a room, there is a warmth\r\nand brightness in his very presence, that causes you to look round,\r\nhalf expecting to see the tables and chairs throwing their shadows\r\nalong the floor, as if, by the power of magic, a window had suddenly\r\nbeen opened in the wall to let in the morning sunshine.\r\n\r\nIf the affections of Uncle Juvinell's heart are childlike in their\r\nfreshness, the powers of his intellect are gigantic in their\r\ndimensions. He is a man of prodigious learning: for proof of which,\r\nyou have but to enter his library, and take note of the books upon\r\nbooks that crowd the shelves from the floor to the ceiling; the maps\r\nthat line the walls; the two great globes, one of the earth and the\r\nother of the heavens, that stand on either side of his reading-desk;\r\nand the reading-desk itself, whereon there always lies some book of\r\nmonstrous size, wide open, which no one has ever had the courage to\r\nread from beginning to end, or could comprehend if he did.\r\n\r\nIn the languages he is very expert; speaking French with such\r\nclearness and distinctness, that any native-born Frenchman, with a\r\nfair knowledge of the English, can with but little difficulty\r\nunderstand more than half he says; and in German he is scarcely less\r\nfluent and ready; while his Latin is the envy of all who know only\r\ntheir mother-tongue. In mathematics, his skill is such, that you might\r\ngive him a sum, the working-out of which would cover three or four\r\nlarge slates; and he would never fail to arrive at the answer, let him\r\nbut take his time.\r\n\r\nIn astronomy, he is perfectly at home among the fixed stars; can\r\ndistinguish them at a single glance, and that, too, without the help\r\nof his spectacles, from the wandering planets; and is as familiar with\r\nthe motion and changes of the moon, as if he had been in the habit for\r\nthe last forty years of spending the hot summer months at some of the\r\nfashionable watering-places of that amiable and interesting orb. But\r\nit is in the history of the nations and great men of the earth that\r\nUncle Juvinell most excels, as shall be proved to your entire\r\nsatisfaction before reaching the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding the vastness of his learning and the gigantic\r\npowers of his mind, he can, when it so pleases him, disburden himself\r\nof these great matters, and descend from his lofty height to the\r\ncomprehension of the little folks, with as much ease as a huge\r\nballoon, soaring amidst the clouds, can let off its gas, and sink down\r\nto the level of the kites, air-balls, and sky-rockets wherewith they\r\nare wont to amuse themselves.\r\n\r\nBeing an old bachelor, as before noticed, he, of course, has no\r\nchildren of his own; but, like the philosopher that he is, he always\r\nconsoles himself for this misfortune with the reflection, that, had he\r\nbeen so favored, much of his love and affection must needs have been\r\nwasted on his own six, eight, or ten, as the case might have been,\r\ninstead of being divided without measure among the hundreds and\r\nthousands of little ones that gladden the wedded life, and fill with\r\ntheir music the homes of others more blessed.\r\n\r\nLiving, as all his brothers do, in easy circumstances, he has abundant\r\ntime and leisure to devote himself to the particular interest and\r\nenjoyment of these little ones; and is always casting in his mind what\r\nhe may be doing to amuse them, or make them wiser, better, and\r\nhappier.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ease, heartiness, and familiarity with which he demeans\r\nhimself when among them, and enters into all their little pastimes and\r\nconcerns, that they stand no more in awe of him than if he were one of\r\ntheir own number; and make him the butt of a thousand impish pranks,\r\nat which he laughs as heartily as the merriest rogue among them. And\r\nyet it is for that very reason, perhaps, that they love him so\r\ndevotedly, and would give up their dog-knives or wax dolls any day,\r\nsooner than show themselves unmindful of his slightest wishes, or do\r\naught that could bring upon them even his softest rebuke. They make\r\nnothing of taking off his gold spectacles, and putting them on their\r\nown little pugs to look wise; or running their chubby fists into the\r\ntight, warm pockets of his breeches, in quest of his gold pencil or\r\npearl-handled knife; or dashing like mad over the yard, with his\r\ngold-headed cane for a steed; or stealing up behind him, as he stands\r\nwith his back to the fire, and slyly pulling out his big red bandanna\r\nhandkerchief, wherewith to yoke the dog and cat together as they lie\r\nsociably side by side on the hearth-rug. In short, he will suffer them\r\nto tease him and tousle him and tumble him to their hearts' content,\r\nand set no limits to their liberties, so long as they are careful not\r\nto touch his snowy linen with their smutched fingers; for, if Uncle\r\nJuvinell has one fault in the world, it is his unreasonable partiality\r\nfor snowy linen. But, were we to go on with our praises and\r\ncommendations of this best of men, we should fill a large volume full\r\nto overflowing, and still leave the better half unsaid: so we must\r\nexercise a little self-denial, and forego such pleasing thoughts for\r\nthe present, as it now behooves us to bring our minds to bear upon\r\nmatters we have more nearly in view.\r\n\r\nSeeing how earnestly the little folks were bent upon drawing out of\r\nhim one of his longest stories, Uncle Juvinell now bade them sit down\r\nand be quiet till he should have time to conjure up something more\r\ncharming than any Arabian tale they had ever heard; and throwing\r\nhimself back in his great arm-chair, and fixing his eyes on the\r\nglowing coals, that seemed to present to his fancy an ever-shifting\r\npanorama, was soon lost in profound meditation. And the longer he\r\nthought, the harder he looked at the fire, which knowingly answered\r\nhis look with a winking and blinking of its great bright eye, that\r\nseemed to say, \"Well, Uncle Juvinell, what shall we do for the\r\nentertainment or instruction of these little people to-night? Shall we\r\ntell them of that crew of antic goblins we wot of, who are wont to\r\nmeet by moonlight, to play at football with the hanged man's head,\r\namong the tombstones of an old graveyard? Or may be that dreadful\r\nogre, with the one fiery eye in the middle of his forehead, who was in\r\nthe habit of roasting fat men on a spit for his Christmas dinners,\r\nwould be more to their taste. Or, if you prefer it, let it be that\r\nbeautiful fairy, who, mounted on a milk-white pony, and dressed in\r\ngreen and gold, made her home in an echoing wood, for no other purpose\r\nthan to lead little children therefrom, who might by some ill chance\r\nbe separated from their friends, and lose their way in its tangled\r\nwilds. Or perhaps you are thinking it would be more instructive to\r\nthem were we to conjure up some story of early times in green\r\nKentucky, when our great-grandfathers were wont to take their rifles\r\nto bed with them, and sleep with them in their arms, ready to spring\r\nup at the slightest rustling of the dry leaves in the woods, and\r\ndefend themselves against the dreaded Indian, as with panther-like\r\ntread he skulked around their lonely dwellings.\"\r\n\r\nTo each and all of these, Uncle Juvinell shook his head; none of them\r\nbeing just exactly the thing he wanted. At length, finding that the\r\nfire hindered rather than helped him to make a choice, he rose from\r\nhis seat, turned his back upon it, and looked from one bright face to\r\nanother of the circle before him, till his eye rested on Daniel, who\r\nwas among the oldest of the children, and was, by the way, the young\r\nhistorian of the family, and, in his own opinion, a youth of rather\r\nuncommon parts. He had that morning received from his uncle, as a\r\nChristmas present, that most delightful of story-books, \"Robinson\r\nCrusoe;\" but having seen the unlucky sailor high, but not dry, on his\r\ndesert island, and having run his eye over all the pictures, he had\r\nlaid it aside, and was now standing at the reading-desk, looking as\r\nwise as a young owl in a fog over a very large book indeed, in which\r\nhe pretended to be too deeply interested to finish a slab of\r\ngingerbread that lay half munched at his side.\r\n\r\nSeeing his little nephew thus engaged, Uncle Juvinell smiled a quiet\r\nsmile all to himself, and, after watching him a few moments, said,\r\n\"Dannie, my boy, what book is that you are reading with so much\r\ninterest that you have forgotten your gingerbread?\"\r\n\r\n\"Irving's Life of Washington, sir,\" replied Daniel with an air.\r\n\r\n\"A good book, a very good indeed; but too hard for you, I fear,\" said\r\nUncle Juvinell, shaking his head. \"Tell me, though, how far you have\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Braddock's defeat, sir,\" replied Daniel.\r\n\r\n\"You have been getting over the ground rather fast, I am thinking; but\r\ntell me how you like it,\" said Uncle Juvinell, by way of drawing his\r\nlittle nephew out.\r\n\r\n\"Here and there, I come to a chapter that I like very much,\" replied\r\nDaniel: \"but there are parts that I don't understand very well; and I\r\nwas just thinking that I would point them out to you some time, and\r\nget you to explain them to me; as you will, I am certain; for you know\r\nevery thing, and are so obliging to us little folks!\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Uncle Juvinell's face lighted up as with a brilliant thought;\r\nbut, without seeming to notice his little nephew's request just then,\r\nhe reseated himself, and again began looking hard at the fire. The\r\nfire opened its great bright eye more widely than before, and looked\r\nas if it were putting the question, \"Well, sir, and what is it now?\r\nOut with it, and I will throw what light I can on the matter.\" After a\r\nfew moments, there appeared to be a perfect understanding between\r\nthem; for the fire with a sly wink seemed to say, \"A happy thought,\r\nUncle Juvinell,--a very happy thought indeed: I was just on the point\r\nof proposing the very same thing myself. Come, let us go about it at\r\nonce, and make these holidays the brightest and happiest these little\r\nfolks have ever known, or ever could or would or should know, in all\r\ntheir lives.\" And the fire fell to winking and blinking at such an\r\nextravagant rate, that the shadows of those who were seated round it\r\nbegan bobbing up and down the wall, looking like misshapen goblins\r\namusing themselves by jumping imaginary ropes, the gigantic one of\r\nUncle Juvinell leaping so high as to butt the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of deep thought, the old gentleman rose, and\r\nstood on his short fat legs with the air of a man who had made up his\r\nmind, and with a smile on his face, as if sure he was just on the\r\npoint of giving them all a pleasant surprise. \"Laura, my dear,\" said\r\nhe, \"take down that picture from the wall you see hanging to the right\r\nof the bookcase; and you, Ella, my darling, take that bunch of\r\nfeathers, and brush off the dust from it. Now hand it to me. This, my\r\ncherubs,\" he went on, \"is the portrait of the good and great George\r\nWashington, who is called the Father of our country. It is to him,\r\nmore than to any other man, that we owe the blessings of freedom,\r\npeace, and prosperity, we now enjoy in larger measure than any other\r\npeople of the wide earth; and it was for these same blessings that he\r\nfought and struggled through all the weary years of our Revolutionary\r\nWar, amidst difficulties, dangers, and discouragements such as never\r\nbefore tried the strength of man. And when, in the happy end, he, by\r\nhis courage, skill, and fortitude, and abiding trust in the protection\r\nof an all-wise Providence, had come out victorious over all, and\r\ndriven our cruel enemies from the land, so that our homes were once\r\nmore gladdened with the smiles of peace and plenty,--then it was that\r\na grateful people with one voice hailed him chosen of the Lord for the\r\nsalvation of our beloved country. Blessed be the name of George\r\nWashington,--blessed for evermore!\" And a big tear of love and\r\nthankfulness started from each of Uncle Juvinell's mild blue eyes,\r\ntrickled slowly over his ruddy cheek, and, dropping thence, went\r\nhopping and sparkling down his large blue waistcoat.\r\n\r\nAt this the little folks looked very grave, and thought to themselves,\r\n\"What a good man Washington must have been, and how much he must have\r\ndone and suffered for the welfare of his fellow-beings, thus to have\r\nbrought the tears to our dear old uncle's eyes!\" After looking at the\r\npicture for some moments in silence, they began talking about it, each\r\nin his or her own fashion; while Uncle Juvinell listened with much\r\ninterest, curious to see what different impressions it would produce\r\non their minds.\r\n\r\n\"That scroll he holds in his left hand must be his farewell address to\r\nhis army,\" said Daniel, the young historian, looking very wise.\r\n\r\n\"What a fine long sword he carries at his side!\" said Bryce, a\r\nwar-like youngster who had just climbed to the summit of his ninth\r\nyear, and had, as you must know, a wooden sword of his own, with which\r\nhe went about dealing death and destruction to whole regiments of\r\ncornstalks and squadrons of horse-weeds, calling them British and\r\nTories.\r\n\r\n\"How tall and grand and handsome he looks!\" said Laura, a prim and\r\ndemure little miss of thirteen: \"in his presence, I am sure I could\r\nnever speak above a whisper.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, yonder, among the trees and evergreens on the hill, must be the\r\nhouse where he lived,\" said Ella, a modest, sweet-mannered little lady\r\nof twelve. \"What a beautiful place it is! and what a happy home it\r\nmust have been when he lived in it!\"\r\n\r\n\"And see how the hill slopes down to the river, so grassy and smooth!\r\nand such a nice place for little boys to roll over and over down to\r\nthe bottom!\" said Ned, a rough-and-tumble youngster of ten, who spent\r\none-half of the sunshine with his back to the ground and his heels in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"And see the beautiful river so broad and so smooth, and the great\r\nships afar off going down to the sea!\" said Johnnie, a little poet of\r\neight, who passed much of his time dreaming with his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\"And such a pretty play-house as I see there among the bushes on the\r\nhillside!\" said Fannie, a stout little matron of five, the mother of a\r\nlarge and still increasing family of dolls.\r\n\r\n\"That is not a play-house, Fannie, but the tomb where Washington lies\r\nburied,\" said Dannie with an air of superior wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"What a splendid white horse that black man is holding for him! How he\r\nbows his neck, and champs his bit, and paws the ground!\" said Willie,\r\na harum-scarum, neck-or-nothing young blade of fourteen, who would\r\nhave given his best leg to have been the owner of a galloping,\r\nhigh-headed, short-tailed pony.\r\n\r\n\"What is he doing so far away from home without his hat, I wonder?\"\r\nsaid Master Charlie, a knowing young gentleman of eight, who was much\r\nin the habit of doubting everybody's eyes and ears but his own.\r\n\r\n\"How kind and good he looks out of his eyes, just like father!\" said\r\nMary, an affectionate and timid little creature of seven.\r\n\r\nJust then, Addison, a plump little fellow of four, in all the glory of\r\nhis first new jacket and his first new breeches, who was standing on\r\nthe top round of Uncle Juvinell's chair, suddenly cried out in a very\r\nstrong voice for his age, \"Oh! he looks just like Uncle Juvinell: now\r\ndon't he, Cousin Mary?\"\r\n\r\nFor a man of his appearance to be thus compared with so stately and\r\ndignified a man as Washington was a thing so ludicrous, that Uncle\r\nJuvinell was surprised into the heartiest fit of laughter that he had\r\nenjoyed that day. When it was over, he bade Laura hang up the picture\r\nagain in its accustomed place, and began where he had left off some\r\ntime before: \"Now, my dear children, it came into my mind, while I was\r\ntalking with your Cousin Dannie a little bit ago, that I could not\r\ntell you any thing more entertaining and instructive than the story of\r\nWashington's life. It will, I am quite sure, interest you much: for\r\nalthough he was such a great man,--the greatest, no doubt, that ever\r\nlived,--and so awful to look upon, yet, for all that, his heart was\r\nfull to overflowing with the most tender and kindly affections, and,\r\nif you can believe it, quite as fond of little children as your Uncle\r\nJuvinell; often joining in their innocent sports for a whole hour at a\r\ntime. Let me see. This is Wednesday; and we have seven, eight, long\r\nholidays before us to be as happy as skylarks in. Now, I am thinking,\r\nthat, if we would have next New Year's Day find us better and wiser,\r\nwe could not hit upon a more proper plan for beginning so desirable an\r\nend than by spending a part of each day in making ourselves acquainted\r\nwith the life and character of this good and great man, and, at the\r\nclose of each evening's lesson, talking over what we have learned, to\r\nour more complete understanding of the same. And now, my merry ones,\r\nspeak out, and tell me what you think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be just exactly the very thing,\" said wise Daniel.\r\n\r\n\"Glorious!\" said rollicking Willie.\r\n\r\n\"Charming!\" said prim and demure Miss Laura.\r\n\r\n\"'Twill be delightful, I am sure,\" said modest Ella.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could please me better, if we have a good big battle now and\r\nthen,\" said war-like Bryce.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if it will be as interesting as 'Robinson Crusoe'?\" put in\r\ndoubting Charlie.\r\n\r\n\"Or 'Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp'?\" chimed in dreaming Johnnie.\r\n\r\n\"And we'll all listen, and be so good!\" said timid, loving little\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment for me, uncle, till I run down to the cabin, just to\r\nsee how Black Daddy's getting along making my sled,\" said hair-brained\r\nNed.\r\n\r\n\"And wait a little bit for me too, uncle, till I go and put my dolly\r\nbabe to bed; for she might take the measles if I keep her up too\r\nlong,\" said motherly Fannie.\r\n\r\n\"And let me sit on your knee, uncle; Cousin Mary wants my chair,\" said\r\nAddison, the youngest one of them all, at the same time climbing up,\r\nand getting astride of Uncle Juvinell's left fat leg.\r\n\r\n\"Then settle yourselves at once, you noisy chatterboxes,\" said Uncle\r\nJuvinell with a shining face; \"and mind you be as quiet and mute as\r\nmice at a cat's wedding while I am telling my story, or I'll\"--His\r\nthreat was drowned in the joyous shouts of the children as they\r\nscrambled into their chairs. When they had all put on a listening\r\nlook, he poured out a little yellow, squat, Dutch mug brimful of rich\r\nbrown cider from a big blue pitcher that Black Daddy had just placed\r\non a table close at hand, and, having wet his whistle therewith, began\r\nhis story. And now and then, as the story went on, the fire, keeping\r\nits bright, watchful eye upon the old gentleman, would wink at him in\r\na sly manner, that seemed to say, \"Well done, Uncle Juvinell,--very\r\nwell done indeed. You see, sir, I was quite right in what I told you.\r\nWe have hit upon the very thing. The little folks are enchanted: they\r\nare drawing in wisdom with every breath. A merry Christmas to us all!\"\r\nPop, pop! hurrah! pop!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nGEORGE AT SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago or more, there stood on the green slopes of the\r\nPotomac, in the county of Westmoreland, Va., an old red farmhouse,\r\nwith a huge stone chimney at each end, and high gray roof, the eaves\r\nof which projected in such a manner as to cover a porch in front and\r\ntwo or three small shed-rooms in the rear. Now, although this house\r\nwas built of wooden beams and painted boards, and was far from being\r\nwhat could be called, even for those times, a fine one,--looking as it\r\ndid more like a barn than a dwelling for man,--yet, for all that, it\r\nhad the honor of being the birthplace of the good and great George\r\nWashington, who is said, by many very wise persons who ought to know,\r\nto have been the greatest man that ever came into this pleasant and\r\nglorious world of ours.\r\n\r\nHis father, Augustine Washington, was married early in life to Jane\r\nButler, who died after having borne him two sons, Lawrence and\r\nAugustine. In a year or two after this loss, feeling the want of some\r\none to gladden his lonely heart and home, he married Mary Ball, the\r\nbelle of Horseneck, and said to have been the most beautiful young\r\nlady in all that part of the country. By this union he was blessed\r\nwith six children, of whom our George, the eldest, was born on the\r\ntwenty-second day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\nseven hundred and thirty-two.\r\n\r\nIt has often appeared strange to me that nothing should be known of\r\nthis great man's life up to the completion of his fifth year: and I am\r\nsorry for your sakes, my little ones, that such is the case; for it\r\nwould be such a nice beginning to our story, could we say with\r\ncertainty that he distinguished himself by walking alone at the age of\r\nfive months; that he could pronounce \"Mother\" and \"Good\" with perfect\r\ndistinctness when but one year old; that his mother taught him at the\r\nage of two to kneel by her side, and lisp, before going to his evening\r\nrest, that beautiful prayer, beginning with, \"Now I lay me down to\r\nsleep;\" that he rode like mad, at the age of three, round and round\r\nthe yard, on his father's buckhorn-headed cane; and that he rode on a\r\nreal horse at the age of four, and went galloping like a young Tartar\r\nround and round the meadow in front of the house, to the delight of\r\nhis young mother, who watched him from the window. Of all this, and a\r\ngreat deal more of the same sort, you would, I doubt not, like much to\r\nhear, and I would like much to tell you; but we must keep within the\r\nbounds of true history, and content ourselves with the knowledge of\r\nthat which really did happen. With this safe rule for our guidance, we\r\nwill therefore proceed at once to take up the thread of our story at\r\nthat period of George's boyhood, concerning which some certain record\r\nhas come down to our time.\r\n\r\nAt the age of five, when he was old enough to walk all alone for a\r\nmile or two through the woods and fields, his parents started him to\r\nschool one bright spring morning, with his little basket on his arm,\r\ncontaining his dinner and a bran-new spelling-book, to take his first\r\ntiny steps in the flowery path of knowledge.\r\n\r\nHis first teacher was a Mr. Hobby, an old man, who lived on a distant\r\npart of his father's plantation, and is said to have been besides the\r\nsexton or grave-digger of the neighborhood; and was, I have my private\r\nreasons for thinking, a broken-down old soldier, with a big cocked hat\r\nthat shaded a kindly and weather-beaten face, and a wooden leg,--an\r\nornament for which he was indebted to a cannon-ball, and took more\r\npride in than if it had been a sound one of flesh and bone. As it is\r\nrarely ever the case that men with wooden legs are called upon to\r\nfight the battles of their country, this worthy old man, who well knew\r\nhow to read and write, and cipher too, must needs earn his livelihood\r\nby teaching school, and sowing his knowledge broadcast among the\r\nlittle children of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was to old Mr. Hobby, as everybody called him, that\r\nGeorge was indebted for his first insight into the mysteries of\r\nbook-learning; and although he was in due time to become the greatest\r\nman of this or any other age or country, yet he began his education\r\nby first learning his A B C, just as did other boys of that day,\r\njust as they are now doing, and just as they will continue to do\r\nfor all time to come. After he had taken his A B C into his memory,\r\nand set them there in a straight row each in its proper place, he was\r\nnot long, depend upon it, in reaching the middle of his spelling-book;\r\nand as soon as he could, without anybody's help, climb over tall and\r\ndifficult words of five or six syllables, such as \"immortality\" or\r\n\"responsibility,\" his master put him in the English Reader, where\r\nhe soon overtook and went clean ahead of boys a great deal older\r\nthan himself. From reading, he in a short time rose to writing;\r\nand it was said by those who knew him best, that he learned to write\r\na neat round hand without ever once blotting his copy-book; and\r\nfurthermore, that such a thing as a dirty, thumb-worn, dog-eared\r\nbook was never seen in his hand. His next step in the path of\r\nknowledge was arithmetic; and, in less time than you can well\r\nbelieve, he had got the multiplication-table so thoroughly by heart,\r\nthat he could run over it as fast backwards, from twelve times twelve\r\nto twice one, as common boys straightforward, even with the open book\r\nbefore their eyes. So well did he study, that, in less than four\r\nyears' time after his first starting to school, the single rule of\r\nthree was no more to him than long division to most boys; and he\r\ncould repeat the tables of weights and measures as glibly as you,\r\nMaster Johnnie, can rattle off the charming story of \"Old Mother\r\nHubbard and her Wonderful Dog.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the rapid progress George made in his studies was owing not so\r\nmuch to his uncommon aptitude at learning as to the diligence and\r\nindustry with which he applied himself to them. For example: when\r\nother boys would be staring out at the window, watching the birds and\r\nsquirrels sporting among the tree-tops; or sitting idly with their\r\nhands in their pockets, opening and shutting their jack-knives, or\r\ncounting their marbles, or munching apples and corn-dodgers in a\r\nsneaking and unbecoming manner behind their books; or, more naughty\r\nstill, shooting paper bullets at old Hobby's wooden leg as he eat\r\ndozing behind his high desk of a drowsy summer afternoon,--our George,\r\nwith his hands to his ears to keep out the schoolroom buzz, would be\r\nstudying with all his might; nor would he once raise his eyes from his\r\nbook till every word of his lesson was ready to drop from his tongue's\r\nend of its own accord. So well did he apply himself, and so attentive\r\nwas he to every thing taught him, that, by the time he was ten years\r\nold, he had learned all that the poor old grave-digger knew himself;\r\nand it was this worthy man's boast in after-years, that he had laid\r\nthe foundation of Washington's future greatness. But what old Wooden\r\nLeg--for so they always called him when his back was turned--could not\r\nteach him at school, little George learned at home of his father and\r\nmother, who were well educated for those days; and many a long winter\r\nevening did these good parents spend in telling their children\r\ninteresting and instructive stories of olden times, far-off countries,\r\nand strange people, which George would write down in his copy-book in\r\nhis neatest, roundest hand, and remember ever afterward.\r\n\r\nA more prudent and careful father, and a more discreet and\r\naffectionate mother, than Mr. Washington and his wife Mary, perhaps\r\nnever lived. So earnest and watchful were they to bring up their\r\nchildren in the fear of the Lord, and in the practice of every noble\r\nvirtue, that their dutiful behavior and sweet manners were the talk\r\nand praise of the good people for miles and miles around. They taught\r\nthem to be neat and orderly in their dress, as well as civil and\r\npolite in their manners; to be respectful to their elders; to be kind\r\nto one another, and to every thing God hath made, both great and\r\nsmall, whether man or bird or beast: but chiefly were they concerned\r\nto teach them the love of truth, and to tell it at all times when it\r\nshould be their duty to speak out, let the consequences be what they\r\nmight. To show you that such wise and careful training was not lost\r\non the tender mind of George, I will tell you the story of his little\r\nhatchet, as it may serve you good stead in the day when you may be\r\ntempted to wander astray from the path of truth and virtue.\r\n\r\nOne Christmas Eve, when the sharp, frosty air made the blood brisk and\r\nlively in the veins, little George, who was then about six years old,\r\nhung up his stocking on the mantel of the huge chimney, saying to\r\nhimself as he did so, \"Good Santa Claus, be kind to me while I am\r\nsleeping peacefully.\" Next morning, bright and early, just as a great\r\nChristmas log had begun to blaze and crackle on the hearth, he jumped\r\nspryly from his bed, and, without stopping to put on his clothes, ran\r\nto his stockings to see what good old Santa Claus had brought him\r\nwhile he slept. I leave you to picture to your minds his delight upon\r\nfinding therein a little Indian tomahawk, with a bright keen edge and\r\nlong red handle. It would have done all your hearts good to have seen\r\nhow he skipped and danced around the room, and flourished his hatchet\r\nhigh over his head; how he went showing it to every one about the\r\nhouse, white and black; praising good old Santa Claus to the very\r\nskies, and never once feeling the want of his breeches. But, between\r\nyou and me, I am rather inclined to suspect, that, if we had any means\r\nof arriving at the facts of the case, it would be found that Santa\r\nClaus had no more concern in this matter than your Uncle Juvinell\r\nhimself. To my mind, there is more reason in the supposition, that his\r\nfather, seeing the jolly old saint pass by at a late hour of the night\r\nin an empty sleigh, and that the children were not likely to have\r\ntheir stockings filled for that once, got up early in the morning, and\r\nput the hatchet in there himself, rather than that his little son\r\nshould be disappointed.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it was all the same to George; and he was as happy\r\nas happy could be. At the breakfast-table, he could hardly eat his\r\nbread and milk for looking at his shining axe, which he had laid\r\nbeside him on the table; and, before it was fairly broad daylight, he\r\nwas out at the wood-yard, ankle-deep in snow, cutting and chopping\r\naway at the hard-seasoned beech and maple logs, as if it lay with him,\r\nfor that day at least, to keep the whole family, white and black, from\r\nfreezing. By and by, however, he found this more work than play, and\r\nbegan to cast his earnest young eyes about him for something green and\r\nsoft whereon to try the edge and temper of his hatchet. Presently, as\r\nill-luck would have it, a fine young English cherry-tree, just over\r\nthe fence hard by, caught his attention, which, without further ado,\r\nhe fell to hacking might and main; and the way he made the little\r\nchips fly was a thing surprising to see.\r\n\r\nNext morning, his father, passing by that way, saw the mischief that\r\nhad been done, and was sorely displeased: for he had planted and\r\nreared this selfsame tree with the tenderest care; and, of all the\r\ntrees in his orchard, there was not one other he prized so highly.\r\nBeing quite sure that it was the work of some of the black children,\r\nhe went straightway down to the negro quarter, bent on finding out,\r\nand bringing the unlucky culprit to a severe account.\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" said he to the first one he met, \"did you cut that\r\ncherry-tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mauster; don't know nothin' 'bout it,\" said Dick, showing the\r\nwhites of _his_ eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Did you, Sam?\" said Mr. Washington, putting the same question to\r\nanother little woolly-head.\r\n\r\n\"No, mauster; don't know nothin' 'bout it,\" said Sam, likewise showing\r\nthe whites of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe same question was put to Harry, who gave Dick and Sam's answer\r\nword for word, and, to add force to his denial, showed the whites of\r\nhis eyes in like manner; and so on, till more than a dozen had been\r\nquestioned with the same result; when it came to Jerry's turn to make\r\ndenial, and show the whites of his eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, you must know there was not a more audacious, mischief-making,\r\nneck-or-nothing black brat than this same Jerry to be found on the\r\nbanks of the Rappahannock, which is a very long river indeed. As a\r\nfish lives in water, or a salamander in fire, so did Jerry live and\r\nbreathe, and have his being, in mischief; or, in other words, mischief\r\nwas the element in which Jerry found his chief delight. If any mishap\r\nbefell anybody or any thing, at any hour of the day or night, on any\r\npart of the plantation, on foot or on horseback, at rest or in motion,\r\nit was sure to be brought and laid at Jerry's door. Being aware of all\r\nthis, Mr. Washington was now quite sure, that, as none of the rest had\r\ncut the cherry-tree, Jerry himself must be the offender; and so he put\r\nthe question to him; to which Jerry, showing the whites of his eyes,\r\nmade answer, \"No, mauster; I didn't cut the cherry-tree: indeed,\r\nindeed, and double deed, I didn't cut the cherry-tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Jerry,\" said his master, \"if you always told the truth, I should\r\nknow when to believe you; but, as you do not, you must take the\r\nconsequences of your evil ways, and blame nobody but yourself.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, Jerry began dancing and hopping around the room in\r\na very brisk and lively manner, even before his master was within ten\r\nfeet of him, as if he already felt the switch about his legs.\r\n\r\nJust then, in the very nick of time, George came walking leisurely by,\r\nhatchet in hand; who, upon seeing how matters stood, without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, ran up to his father, and, dropping his hatchet,\r\ncaught him round the leg, just as the first stroke of the switch was\r\nabout to descend on the calves of the unlucky Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"O papa, papa!\" cried he, \"don't whip poor Jerry: if somebody must be\r\nwhipped, let it be me; for it was I, and not Jerry, that cut the\r\ncherry-tree. I didn't know how much harm I was doing; I didn't\r\nindeed.\" And the child began crying piteously.\r\n\r\nWith a look of glad surprise, his father, dropping the switch, caught\r\nhis brave little boy in his arms, and folded him tenderly, lovingly,\r\nto his bosom. \"Now, thanks be to God,\" cried he, \"thanks be to God,\r\nthat I have a son whose love of truth is greater than his fear of\r\npunishment! Look on him, my black children, look on him, and be as\r\nnear like him as you can, if you would have the love of your master\r\nand the good-will of all around you.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing the unlooked-for turn the affair had taken, and not having the\r\nwords to express the feelings of joy and thankfulness that swelled\r\nalmost to bursting in his little black breast, Jerry darted through\r\nthe door, out into the yard, kicked up his heels, yelped like a young\r\ndog, threw a somerset in the snow, and went rolling over and over down\r\nto the bottom of the hill, and ever after loved his noble little\r\nmaster to distraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George had learned all that poor old Hobby could teach him, his\r\nfather, to reward him for his diligence and good behavior at school,\r\nindulged him in two or three weeks' holidays, which he went to spend\r\nat a distance from home, among some friends and relatives. Here, as\r\nusual, he was made much of; for, being a great favorite with all who\r\nknew him, he met with a cordial reception wherever he went; and what\r\nwith hunting and fishing, riding and visiting, the time spent here was\r\nthe most delightful he had ever known. But hardly had half the happy\r\ndays flown by, when word came that his father was sick, even unto\r\ndeath; and that, of all things, he most desired to look upon his noble\r\nboy once more before he died. With a sadness and heaviness of heart he\r\nhad never before experienced, George set out on his return home, where\r\nhe arrived just in time to receive his dying father's blessing. Long\r\nand deeply did he mourn his loss; for his father was most tenderly\r\nbeloved by his children, and greatly esteemed by his friends and\r\nneighbors as a useful member of society, and a man of many sterling\r\ntraits of character.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington was thus left a young widow with a large family of\r\nyoung children, whom it now became her duty to provide for and educate\r\nin a manner becoming a Christian mother; and how well and faithfully\r\nand lovingly she discharged this sacred trust, is most beautifully set\r\nforth in the life and character of her great son. She was a woman of\r\nuncommon strength and clearness of understanding, and her heart was\r\nthe home of every pure and noble virtue. She was mild, but firm;\r\ngenerous, but just; candid whenever she deemed it her duty to speak\r\nher mind, but never losing sight of the respect and consideration due\r\nto the feelings and opinions of others. She was gentle and loving with\r\nher children, yet exacting from them in return the strictest obedience\r\nto her will and wishes. But of all virtues most sacred in her eyes was\r\nthat of the love of truth, which she ever sought to implant in their\r\nminds; assuring them, that, without it, all other virtues were but as\r\nunprofitable weeds, barren of fruits and flowers. She was simple and\r\ndignified in her manners, and had a hearty dislike for every thing\r\nsavoring of parade and idle show. She always received her friends and\r\nvisitors with a cordial smile of welcome, spreading before them with\r\nan unsparing hand the best her house afforded: but, when they rose to\r\ndepart, she would invite them once, and once only, to stay longer;\r\nand, if after this they still seemed bent on going, she would do all\r\nin her power to speed them on their journey. With so many traits\r\nbetokening strength of mind and character, she had but one weakness;\r\nand this was her excessive dread of thunder, caused in early\r\nmaidenhood by seeing a young lady struck dead at her side by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nAnd such was Mary, the mother of Washington; and seldom indeed has her\r\nlike been seen. As her husband, by industry and prudent management,\r\nhad gathered together enough of the riches of this world to leave each\r\nof his children a fine plantation, she was not hindered by straitened\r\ncircumstances, or anxiety as to their means of future support, from\r\ngiving her chief attention to such bodily and mental training as\r\nshould have a lasting tendency to make them, in more mature years,\r\nhealthy, virtuous, and wise.\r\n\r\nIt has been often remarked, that those men who have most distinguished\r\nthemselves in the world's history for noble thoughts and heroic deeds,\r\nhave, as a general thing, inherited those qualities of mind and heart\r\nwhich made them great, from their mothers, rather than from their\r\nfathers; and also that their efforts to improve and elevate the\r\ncondition of their fellow-beings have been owing in a larger measure\r\nto the lessons of truth, piety, and industry, taught them by their\r\nmothers in childhood and early youth. If this be the case, then how\r\nmuch are we indebted for the freedom, prosperity, and happiness we\r\nnow enjoy above other nations of the earth, to Mary, the mother of\r\nWashington! Perhaps, to give you a still more forcible idea of the\r\ncharacters of both mother and son, and of the wholesome effects on him\r\nof her judicious training, I ought to relate in this place the story\r\nof his attempt at taming the sorrel horse.\r\n\r\nA fine horse was an object that afforded Mrs. Washington, as it did\r\nthe other substantial Virginia ladies of that day, quite as much, if\r\nnot more, real pleasure than their more delicate grand-daughters of\r\nthe present now find in their handsome carriages, lap-dogs, and\r\ncanary-birds. So great was her fondness for this noble animal, that\r\nshe usually suffered two or three of her finest to run in a meadow in\r\nfront of the house, where she might look at them from time to time as\r\nshe sat sewing at her dining-room window. One of these was a young\r\nsorrel horse, of great beauty of form, and fleetness of foot, but of\r\nso wild and vicious a nature, that, for fear of accident, she had\r\nforbidden any one to mount him, although he had already reached his\r\nfull height and size.\r\n\r\nNow, you must know that a bolder and more skilful rider than George\r\nwas not to be found in all the Old Dominion, as Virginia is sometimes\r\ncalled; and it was this early practice that afterwards won for him the\r\nname of being the finest horseman of his day. Often, as we may very\r\nnaturally suppose to have been the case, would he reason thus with\r\nhimself, as, sitting on the topmost rail of a worm fence, he watched\r\nthe spirited young animal frisking and bounding about the field in all\r\nthe freedom of his untamed nature: \"If I were but once upon his back,\r\nwith a strong bit in his mouth, believe me, I would soon make him a\r\nthing of use as well as ornament; and it would, I am sure, be such a\r\npleasant surprise to mother to look from her window some fine morning,\r\nand see me mounted on his back, and managing him with ease, and to\r\nknow that it was I who had subdued his proud spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, full of these thoughts, he arose early one bright summer\r\nmorning, and invited two or three friends of his own age, then on a\r\nvisit at his mother's house, to go with him to the fields, to share\r\nwith him the sport, or lend their aid in carrying out his design,\r\nshould it be found too difficult and hazardous for himself alone. They\r\nneeded no second bidding, these young madcaps, to whom nothing could\r\nbe more to their liking than such wild sport. So at it they went; and\r\nafter a deal of chasing and racing, heading and doubling, falling down\r\nand picking themselves up again, and more shouting and laughing than\r\nthey had breath to spare for, they at last succeeded in driving the\r\npanting and affrighted young animal into a corner. Here, by some means\r\nor other (it was difficult to tell precisely how), they managed to\r\nbridle him, although at no small risk of a broken head or two from\r\nhis heels, that he seemed to fling about him in a dozen different\r\ndirections at once. Having thus made him their captive, they led him\r\nout to the more open parts of the field, where George requested his\r\nfriends to hold him till he could get on his back. But the wild and\r\nunruly spirit the young beast had shown that morning had so dismayed\r\nthem, that they flatly refused to comply; begging him not to think of\r\nattempting it, as it would be at the risk of life or limb. But George\r\nwas not to be daunted by such trifles; and seeing that his blood was\r\nup, and knowing that, when this was the case with him, he was not to\r\nbe turned aside from his purpose, they at length yielded unwilling\r\nconsent to his entreaties; and, giving him the required aid, he was\r\nsoon mounted.\r\n\r\nThis was an insult the proud-spirited animal could not brook; and he\r\nbegan plunging and rearing in a manner so frightful to behold, that\r\nthey who watched the struggle for mastery expected every moment to see\r\nthe daring young rider hurled headlong to the ground. But he kept his\r\nseat unmoved and firm as an iron statue on an iron horse. At length,\r\nhowever, the horse, clinching the bit between his teeth, became for a\r\ntime unmanageable, and sped away over the field on the wings of the\r\nwind; till, making a false step, he staggered and plunged, rallied\r\nagain, staggered, and, with the red life-stream gushing from his\r\nnostrils, dropped down dead.\r\n\r\nGeorge sprang from the ground unharmed: but, when he saw the noble\r\nyoung animal stretched out smoking and bloody and lifeless before him,\r\ntears of pity filled his eyes; and still faster did they flow when he\r\nthought of the grief it would occasion his mother, when she should\r\nhear how her beautiful favorite had come to his end. His companions\r\nnow rejoining him, they all, with sad misgiving in their hearts,\r\nreturned to the house, where Mrs. Washington met them with a cheerful\r\ngood-morning, and, when they had taken their seats at the\r\nbreakfast-table, began talking with them in her usual lively and\r\nentertaining manner, until the dreaded question came: \"Well, young\r\ngentlemen,\" said she, \"have you seen any thing of my sorrel horse in\r\nyour walks this morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at one another for some moments in silence, scarce\r\nknowing what answer to make. At last, George, to put an end to the\r\npainful suspense, said in a subdued voice, \"Mother, the sorrel horse\r\nis dead.\" He then, in a few brief words, told her how it had all\r\nhappened, and ended by entreating her forgiveness if he had offended;\r\nat the same time assuring her, that, in so doing, he had only thought\r\nof giving her a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nWhen he first began his account of the mishap, a flush of anger rose\r\nto his mother's cheek; of which, however, there was not a trace to be\r\nseen by the time he had finished; and she answered, with something\r\nlike an approving smile, \"My son, as you have had the courage to come\r\nand tell me the truth at once, I freely forgive you: had you skulked\r\naway, I would have despised you, and been ashamed to own you as my\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nPLAYING SOLDIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, Mrs. Washington left the care and\r\neducation of her son George, in no small measure, to the judgment and\r\ndiscretion of her step-son Lawrence, a young man of twenty-five, and\r\nlately married to Miss Fairfax. The love that had always existed\r\nbetween these two brothers was something beautiful indeed to\r\nbehold,--the more so when we take into consideration the difference of\r\nfourteen years in their ages; and, now that their dear father was no\r\nmore, this love grew all the more tender and strong, and George soon\r\nlearned to look up to his eldest brother as to a second father.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence Washington, besides being a fine scholar and one of the\r\nmost polished gentlemen of his day, was also a brave and able soldier;\r\nhaving served during the late Spanish war as a lieutenant under the\r\ngreat Admiral Vernon, in honor of whom he had named his fine estate on\r\nthe Potomac, Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Vernon, then, we find George spending by far the greater\r\nportion of his holidays; and here he often fell in with young\r\nofficers, fellow-soldiers of his brother, to whom with eager ears he\r\nwas wont to listen as they recounted their adventures, and told of\r\nhard-fought battles by land and sea with the roving pirates, or\r\nsea-robbers, and proud and vengeful Spaniards. These stories so fired\r\nhis ardent young spirit, that he longed of all things to become a\r\ngreat soldier, that he might go forth to fight the enemies of his\r\ncountry, wherever they were to be found, and drive them from the face\r\nof the wide earth. To give these feelings some relief, he would muster\r\nhis little school-fellows at play-time, and take them through the\r\nlessons of a military drill; showing them how to fire and fall back,\r\nhow to advance and retreat, how to form in line of march, how to pitch\r\ntheir tents for a night's encampment, how to lay an Indian ambuscade,\r\nhow to scale a wall, how to storm a battery; and, in short, forty\r\nother evolutions not to be found in any work on military tactics ever\r\nwritten, and at which old Wooden Leg, had he been there, would have\r\nshaken his cocked hat with a dubious look. Then dividing them into two\r\nopposing armies, with himself at the head of one, and the tallest boy\r\nof the school leading on the other, he would incite them to fight sham\r\nbattles with wooden swords, wooden guns, snow-balls, and such other\r\nmunitions of war as came most readily to hand; in which George, no\r\nmatter what might be the odds against him, or what superior advantages\r\nthe enemy might have in weapons or ground, was always sure to come off\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nHe was a handsome boy, uncommonly tall, strong, and active for his\r\nage; could out-run, out-jump, out-ride any boy three years older than\r\nhimself; and, in wrestling, there was not one in a hundred who could\r\nbring his back to the ground. Many stories are told of his wonderful\r\nstrength; and the spot is still shown, where, when a boy, he stood on\r\nthe banks of the Rappahannock River, and, at its widest part, threw a\r\nstone to the opposite side,--a feat that no one has been found able to\r\nperform since that day. It was said, that, a few years later, he stood\r\nunder the Natural Bridge, and threw a silver dollar upon the top of\r\nit,--a height of two hundred and twenty feet; not less than that of\r\nBunker-hill Monument, and more than double that of the tallest hickory\r\nthat ever hailed down its ripened nuts upon your heads. Although there\r\nwere none more studious than he in the schoolroom, yet he always took\r\nthe keenest delight in every kind of active and manly sport, and was\r\nthe acknowledged leader of the playground. But he had qualities of\r\nmind and heart far more desirable and meritorious than those of mere\r\nbodily activity and strength. Such was his love of truth, his strong\r\nsense of justice, and his clearness of judgment, that, when any\r\ndispute arose between his playmates, they always appealed to him to\r\ndecide the difference between them, as willing to abide by his\r\ndecision, and make it their law. Although he had the courage of a\r\nyoung lion, and was even more than a match in strength for many an\r\nolder boy, he was never known to have a fight at school, nor elsewhere\r\nindeed, that I have ever heard; for such was the respect he ever\r\nshowed to the feelings and wishes of others, that he never gave an\r\ninsult, and, depend upon it, never received one.\r\n\r\nThe high ground of Mount Vernon commands a splendid view of the\r\nPotomac up and down for miles, where it makes a noble bend, and winds\r\nits shining course amidst verdant meadow-slopes and richly wooded\r\nhills. Now and then, in the course of the year, some noble ship, with\r\nall its sails outspread and gay banners fluttering to the breeze,\r\nmight be seen moving down the majestic stream, hastening in its pride\r\nand strength to stem the billows of the mighty ocean. With the keenest\r\nof delight none but the young and daring mind can ever know, George,\r\nas he stood on the piazza in front of his brother's mansion, would\r\nwatch them with wishful eyes, until a bend of the river hid their\r\nlofty masts behind the green tops of the yet more lofty hills between.\r\nThen would there awaken in his heart an earnest longing to become a\r\nsailor; to go forth in some gallant ship upon the face of the great\r\ndeep; to visit those far-off countries, where he might behold with his\r\nown eyes those wonders he had read so much of in books. At such\r\ntimes, it may be, there would arise in his mind enchanting visions of\r\nsome desert island, upon whose lonely rocky shores he might some day\r\nhave the rare good fortune of being thrown by the angry billows, there\r\nto dwell, like another Robinson Crusoe, many, many years, with no\r\nother company than talking birds, skipping goats, and dancing cats,\r\nand, if so lucky, a good man Friday, to be rescued by his daring from\r\nthe bloody clutches of the terrible cannibals.\r\n\r\nLawrence Washington was not long in discovering the thoughts that were\r\nuppermost in the mind of the adventurous boy; and, like the generous\r\nbrother that he was, resolved that, should an opportunity offer, a\r\nwish so natural should be gratified. In a short time after, George\r\nbeing then about fourteen years of age, a British man-of-war moved up\r\nthe Potomac, and cast anchor in full view of Mount Vernon. On board of\r\nthis vessel his brother Lawrence procured him a midshipman's warrant,\r\nafter having by much persuasion gained the consent of his mother;\r\nwhich, however, she yielded with much reluctance, and many misgivings\r\nwith respect to the profession her son was about to choose. Not\r\nknowing how much pain all this was giving his mother, George was as\r\nnear wild with delight as could well be with a boy of a nature so even\r\nand steady. Now, what had all along been but a waking dream was about\r\nto become a wide-awake reality. His preparations were soon made:\r\nalready was his trunk packed, and carried on board the ship that was\r\nto bear him so far away from his native land; and nothing now remained\r\nbut to bid farewell to the loved ones at home. But when he came and\r\nstood before his mother, dressed in his gay midshipman's uniform, so\r\ntall and robust in figure, so handsome in face, and so noble in look\r\nand gesture, the thought took possession of her mind, that, if she\r\nsuffered him to leave her then, she might never see him more; and,\r\nlosing her usual firmness and self-control, she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Deeply do I regret, my dear son,\" said she, \"to disappoint you in a\r\nwish you have so near at heart: but I find I cannot bring myself to\r\ngive you up yet; for, young as you are, your aid and counsel have\r\nalready become to me of the greatest service and comfort; and these\r\nlittle fatherless ones, now weeping around you, have learned to look\r\nup to you as their protector and guide. You know too little of the\r\nways of the world, and are too young and inexperienced, to go forth to\r\nendure its hardships, and battle with its temptations, that lie in\r\nwait on every side to entrap the unwary, and lead them down to\r\ndestruction. Without you, our home would be lonely indeed: then, for\r\nyour mother's sake, and for the sake of these little ones, give up\r\nyour darling scheme, for the present at least, that we may all be\r\nhappy at home once more together.\"\r\n\r\nThus entreated, what could he do but yield consent to the wishes of a\r\nloving and prudent mother, and remain at home? where, in a few days,\r\nhis noble self-denial was rewarded with a sweet contentment of mind\r\nthat he could never have known had he left the dear ones in sorrow\r\nbehind him, and gone forth to spend months and years upon the billows\r\nof the lonely seas. Surely a kind Heaven so ordered that the welfare\r\nand happiness of us Americans, and, it may be, that of the whole\r\nworld, should be made to depend upon the promptings of a mother's\r\nlove; for had the boy Washington realized this early dream, and gone\r\nforth in that gallant ship, he might have perished in the stormy deep,\r\nand we had never known the name we now love so much to praise and\r\nvenerate. Or, by his distinguished abilities, he might have risen to\r\nbecome in time the Lord High Admiral of the British Navy; and, instead\r\nof being set apart to the salvation of his native land, might have\r\nbeen made an instrument to its destruction, impossible as such an\r\nevent may now appear to us, with our knowledge of the glorious work he\r\ndid perform when in the fulness of his strength and years, and\r\naccustomed as we are to behold in him our model of all that is great\r\nand virtuous in mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\"RULES OF BEHAVIOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the five years following his father's death, George made his home\r\nat the house of his half-brother, Augustine Washington, at a\r\nconsiderable distance from his mother's, where he might have the\r\nbenefit of a better school which that neighborhood afforded. His new\r\nschoolmaster was a Mr. Williams, a very worthy man; who, however,\r\nalthough he knew a vast deal more than Mr. Hobby, the poor old\r\ngrave-digger, was far from being what we might call a first-rate\r\nscholar. But what his teacher lacked in learning, George made up in\r\ndiligence, and the most judicious use of every means of\r\nself-improvement within his reach. And here, my dear children, let me\r\nremind you of a thing worthy of your remembrance through life, that\r\nsuccess in the pursuit of knowledge depends far less upon the ability\r\nand skill of the teacher, than upon the industry, perseverance, and\r\nwilling application of the learner.\r\n\r\nUnder the instruction of this, his second and last teacher, George got\r\na little insight into English grammar, read some history, became well\r\nacquainted with geography, completely mastered arithmetic, and made\r\nhandsome progress in geometry and trigonometry; which, as you must\r\nknow, are higher branches of mathematics than arithmetic, and far more\r\ndifficult to comprehend. In connection with the two latter, he studied\r\nsurveying; by which is taught, as you must continue to bear in mind\r\nhereafter, the measurement of land.\r\n\r\nWhen he had advanced so far in this study as to give him some idea of\r\nthe proper use and handling of the chain and compass, the two\r\nprincipal instruments employed in this art, he began to put his\r\nknowledge into practice by taking surveys of the farms lying in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of his schoolhouse, and also of the lands\r\nbelonging to the estate of Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nAssisted by his schoolmates, he would follow up, and measure off with\r\nthe help of his long steel chain, the boundary lines between the\r\nfarms, such as fences, roads, and watercourses; then those dividing\r\nthe different parts of the same farm; determining at the same time,\r\nwith the help of his compass, their various courses, their crooks and\r\nwindings, and the angles formed at their points of meeting or\r\nintersection. This would enable him to get at the shape and size not\r\nonly of each farm, but of every meadow, field, and wood composing it.\r\nThis done, he would make a map or drawing on paper of the land\r\nsurveyed, whereon would be clearly traced the lines dividing the\r\ndifferent parts, with the name and number of acres of each attached;\r\nwhile, on the opposite page, he would write down the long and\r\ndifficult tables of figures by which these results had been reached.\r\nAll this he would execute with as much neatness and accuracy as if it\r\nhad been left with him to decide thereby some gravely disputed\r\nland-claim.\r\n\r\nTo qualify himself for the management of business affairs upon\r\nreaching the age of manhood, he would copy off into a blank-book every\r\nform or instrument of writing he would meet with; such as deeds,\r\nwills, notes of hand, bills of exchange, receipts, bonds,\r\nland-warrants, &c., &c. And, what was still more remarkable in a boy\r\nof thirteen, he wrote down, under the head of what he called \"Rules of\r\nBehavior in Company and Conversation,\" such wise maxims, and lines of\r\nwholesome advice, as he would pick up from time to time in the course\r\nof his reading or observation, to aid him in forming habits of\r\nindustry, politeness, and morality. Some of these rules, your Uncle\r\nJuvinell, with an eye mainly to your well-being, will repeat to you;\r\nfor, when but a boy, he got them by heart, well knowing, that, without\r\nsome such aid, he would find it hard, if not impossible, to so order\r\nhis walks through life as to win and deserve the esteem and confidence\r\nof his fellow-men, as well as the blessing and approbation of his\r\nMaker. And now that he has reached the evening of his days, and is\r\nwell assured that the daily observance of these rules has made him a\r\nwiser, a better, and a happier man, he would most earnestly advise all\r\nhis friends, great or small, but especially small, be they boys or\r\ngirls, to pursue the like course, if they would be favored of Heaven\r\nin the like manner. Here they are:--\r\n\r\n     \"1. Every action in company ought to be with some sign of\r\n     respect to those present.\r\n\r\n     \"2. In the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a\r\n     humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Speak not when others speak, sit not when others stand,\r\n     speak not when you should hold your peace, walk not when others\r\n     stop.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog\r\n     not the table or desk on which another reads or writes; lean\r\n     not on any one.\r\n\r\n     \"5. Be not a flatterer; neither play with any one that delights\r\n     not to be played with.\r\n\r\n     \"6. Show not yourself glad at the misfortune of another, though\r\n     he were your enemy.\r\n\r\n     \"7. It is good manners to prefer them to whom we speak before\r\n     ourselves, especially if they be above us; with whom in no sort\r\n     ought we to begin.\r\n\r\n     \"8. Strive not with your superiors in an argument, but always\r\n     submit your judgment to others with modesty.\r\n\r\n     \"9. Undertake not to teach your equal in the art himself\r\n     professes; for it is immodest and presumptuous.\r\n\r\n     \"10. When a man does all he can, though it succeeds not well,\r\n     blame not him that did it.\r\n\r\n     \"11. Before you advise or find fault with any one, consider\r\n     whether it ought to be in public or in private, presently or\r\n     at some other time, in what terms to do it; and, in reproving,\r\n     show no signs of anger, but do it with sweetness and mildness.\r\n\r\n     \"12. Take all advice thankfully, in what time or place soever\r\n     given; but afterwards, not being blamable, take a time or place\r\n     convenient to let him know it that gave it.\r\n\r\n     \"13. Mock not in jest at any thing of importance: if you\r\n     deliver any thing witty and pleasant, abstain from laughing\r\n     thereat yourself.\r\n\r\n     \"14. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for\r\n     example is better than precept.\r\n\r\n     \"15. Use no reproachful language against any one; neither curse\r\n     nor revile.\r\n\r\n     \"16. Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the injury of\r\n     any.\r\n\r\n     \"17. In your apparel, be modest, and endeavor to accommodate\r\n     yourself to nature, rather than to procure admiration; keep to\r\n     the fashion of your equals, such as are civil and orderly, with\r\n     respect to time and places.\r\n\r\n     \"18. Play not the peacock, looking everywhere about you to see\r\n     if you be well decked, if your shoes fit well, if your\r\n     pantaloons sit neatly, and clothes handsomely.\r\n\r\n     \"19. Associate yourself with men of good quality, if you esteem\r\n     your reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad\r\n     company.\r\n\r\n     \"20. Let your conversation be without malice or envy, for it is\r\n     a sign of a kindly and commendable nature; and, in all causes\r\n     of passion, admit reason to govern.\r\n\r\n     \"21. Be not immodest in urging a friend to make known a secret.\r\n\r\n     \"22. Utter not base and frivolous things amongst grave and\r\n     learned men, nor very difficult questions or subjects among the\r\n     ignorant, nor things hard to believe.\r\n\r\n     \"23. Speak not of doleful things in time of mirth, nor at the\r\n     table; speak not of melancholy things, as death and wounds;\r\n     and, if others mention them, change, if you can, the discourse.\r\n     Tell not your dreams but to your intimate friend.\r\n\r\n     \"24. Break not a jest, when none take pleasure in mirth; laugh\r\n     not loud, nor at all, without occasion; deride no man's\r\n     misfortune, though there seem to be some cause.\r\n\r\n     \"25. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor earnest;\r\n     scoff at none, although they give occasion.\r\n\r\n     \"26. Seek not to lessen the merits of others; neither give more\r\n     than due praise.\r\n\r\n     \"27. Go not thither where you know not whether you shall be\r\n     welcome. Give not advice without being asked; and, when\r\n     desired, do it briefly.\r\n\r\n     \"28. Reprove not the imperfections of others; for that belongs\r\n     to parents, masters, and superiors.\r\n\r\n     \"29. Gaze not on the marks or blemishes of others, and ask not\r\n     how they came. What you may speak in secret to your friend,\r\n     deliver not before others.\r\n\r\n     \"30. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor\r\n     bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.\r\n\r\n     \"31. When another speaks, be attentive yourself, and disturb\r\n     not the audience. If any hesitate in his words, help him not\r\n     nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not nor\r\n     answer him until his speech be ended.\r\n\r\n     \"32. Treat with men at right times about business, and whimper\r\n     not in the company of others.\r\n\r\n     \"33. Be not in haste to relate news, if you know not the truth\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"34. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither\r\n     approach those that speak in private.\r\n\r\n     \"35. Undertake not what you cannot perform, but be careful to\r\n     keep your promise.\r\n\r\n     \"36. When your masters or superiors talk to anybody, hearken\r\n     not, nor speak or laugh.\r\n\r\n     \"37. Speak not evil of the absent; for it is unjust.\r\n\r\n     \"38. Make no show of taking delight in your victuals; feed not\r\n     with greediness; cut your food with a knife, and lean not on\r\n     the table; neither find fault with what you eat.\r\n\r\n     \"39. Be not angry at the table, whatever happens; and, if you\r\n     have reason to be so, show it not, but put on a cheerful face,\r\n     especially if there be strangers; for good humor makes of one\r\n     dish a feast.\r\n\r\n     \"40. If you speak of God or his attributes, let it be\r\n     seriously, in reverence; and honor and obey your parents.\r\n\r\n     \"41. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.\r\n\r\n     \"42. Labor to keep in your breast that little spark of\r\n     celestial fire called conscience.\"\r\n\r\nNow, does it not strike you, my dear children, as being most truly\r\nwonderful that it should have ever entered the mind of a boy of\r\nthirteen to lay down for his own guidance and self-improvement such\r\nrules and principles as these I have just repeated? It certainly must.\r\nAnd yet when I tell you that he strictly adhered to them through life,\r\nand squared his conduct by them daily, you will, no doubt, think it\r\nquite unreasonable that he could have been other than the good and\r\ngreat man he was.\r\n\r\nThese writings I have mentioned filled several quires of paper; and\r\ntogether with his business papers, letters, journals, and\r\naccount-books, written later in life, and with the same neatness and\r\nprecision, are still preserved at Mount Vernon with pious care; and\r\nare even now to be seen by those who go on pilgrimages to that sacred\r\nspot, although, since many of them were penned, more than a hundred\r\nyears have come and gone.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my children, you have seen young Washington, at an age when\r\nmost boys are wasting their precious hours in idle sports, seeking to\r\nacquire those habits of industry, punctuality, and method, which\r\nafterwards enabled him so to economize time and labor as to do with\r\nease and expedition what others did with difficulty and tardiness. You\r\nhave seen him making the best use of the slender means within his\r\nreach for storing his mind with those treasures of knowledge, and\r\nschooling his heart in the daily practice of those exalted virtues,\r\nwhich, after a life well spent and work well done, make good his title\r\nto the name he bears,--the greatest and the wisest of human kind.\r\n\r\nAt last, the day came when George was to leave school for ever; and a\r\nday of sorrow it was to his school-fellows, who parted from him with\r\nmany an affectionate wish, and, as we are told, even with tears; so\r\ngreatly had he endeared himself to them by his noble disposition,\r\ngentle manners, and earnest desire to do as he would be done by, which\r\nappeared in all his words and actions. In these regrets, Mr. Williams,\r\nhis worthy schoolmaster, also shared; and it gave him in after-life,\r\nwhen his little George had become the great Washington, the most\r\nheartfelt pleasure to say, that it had never been his privilege to\r\nteach another pupil who could at all compare with him for diligence in\r\napplication, aptitude in learning, docility of disposition, manly\r\ngenerosity, courage, and truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtending from the Rappahannock to the Potomac, and stretching away\r\nbeyond the Blue Ridge far into the Alleghany Mountains, there lay at\r\nthis time an immense tract of forest land, broken only here and there\r\nby a little clearing, in the midst of which stood the rude log-cabin\r\nof some hardy backwoodsman. This large body of land--the largest,\r\nindeed, ever owned by any one man in Virginia--was the property of a\r\ngreat English nobleman named Lord Fairfax, an old bachelor of\r\neccentric habits and strange opinions, but of a highly cultivated\r\nunderstanding, and, when it so pleased him, of polite and elegant\r\naddress. His stature was lofty,--far above that of the common run of\r\nmen. He was a keen sportsman, had a fund of whimsical humor, and, in\r\nhis odd way, showed himself possessed of a kindly and generous heart;\r\nsometimes making a tenant or poor friend the present of a large farm,\r\nwithout requiring any thing in return but a haunch of venison or a fat\r\nwild turkey for his next Christmas dinner.\r\n\r\nHaving heard that settlements were being made in the most fertile\r\nvalleys of his wild domain, he had lately come over from the\r\nmother-country to inquire into the matter, and make suitable provision\r\nagainst any future encroachments of the kind upon his rights. He now\r\nbeheld his forest possessions for the first time; and so charmed was\r\nhe with the wild beauty of the scenery, and so won over by enticing\r\nvisions of fishing and hunting, conjured up by the sight of the waving\r\nwoods and running streams, that he resolved to leave his native land\r\nfor ever, and take up his abiding-place for the rest of his days amid\r\nthose leafy solitudes. Accordingly, he betook himself, with all his\r\nnegro servants (numbering one hundred and fifty), and a few white\r\ndependants, to the beautiful Valley of the Shenandoah, lying between\r\nthe Blue Ridge and the Alleghany Mountains; where he soon cleared a\r\nlarge plantation, and built thereon a house, to which he gave the name\r\nof Greenway Court.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, this became his fixed abode; but, as he had\r\nmore land than a thousand men could put to any good use, he was quite\r\nwilling to dispose of all, except what lay for a few miles immediately\r\naround Greenway Court, at reasonable rates, to such honest persons as\r\nwere willing to buy it and make it their future home. But, in order\r\nthat no misunderstanding might arise hereafter between the parties\r\nconcerned with respect to the boundary-line and number of acres\r\nbought and sold, it was necessary, in the first place, to have the\r\nland surveyed, and divided into lots of convenient sizes for farms.\r\n\r\nNow, you must know that, old Lord Fairfax was a distant relative of\r\nMrs. Lawrence Washington, and had, as a natural consequence, often met\r\nour George at Mount Vernon; and so struck was he with the manly\r\nbearing, high character, good sense, and mathematical skill, of the\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed youth, that he offered him, young as he was,\r\nthe place of surveyor of all his vast lands. Being the son of a\r\nwidowed mother, and earnestly desirous of aiding her all in his power,\r\nand earning for himself an honest independence, George was but too\r\nhappy to accept of the offer; and the necessary arrangements were soon\r\nmade. Having provided himself with all things needful for the new\r\nenterprise,--such as a horse, a rifle, a blanket, and a steel chain\r\nand compass,--he set out, at the head of a small party of hunters and\r\nbackwoodsmen, upon this his first considerable field of labor, early\r\nin the spring of 1748, just one month from the completion of his\r\nsixteenth year.\r\n\r\nThey were soon, in the depths of the wilderness, miles beyond the most\r\ndistant frontier settlements. The snows of winter that still lingered\r\non the mountains, warmed by the softer airs of early spring, had\r\nmelted so rapidly of late as to swell the forest streams to a degree\r\nthat rendered their fording often difficult, and even sometimes\r\ndangerous. Now and then, coming to a stream which had overflowed its\r\nbanks, the little party would be obliged to construct a raft of logs,\r\nroughly lashed together with grape-vines, upon which they could push\r\nto the opposite side, without getting their baggage wet, and, at the\r\nsame time, compel their horses to swim along behind. Their way was\r\noften obstructed by the trunks and branches of fallen trees, thickets\r\ntangled and dense and thorny, huge and rugged rocks, and treacherous\r\nswamps, covered with long, green grass, into which the horses,\r\nstepping unawares, would suddenly plunge up to the saddle-girths in\r\nwater and mire.\r\n\r\nFor some time, they lodged in wigwams or huts, rudely framed of poles,\r\nand covered with the bark of trees; which served the purpose well\r\nenough when the weather was dry and still, but were often beaten down\r\nand overturned by the winds and rains when their shelter was most\r\nneeded. After two or three of these rickety shanties had been tumbled\r\nabout their heads, to the no small risk of life or limb, they wisely\r\nconcluded to abandon them, and sleep in the open air, with the\r\ntwinkling stars above them, the gray old trees around them, and the\r\ndamp, cold ground beneath them, with nothing between but their good\r\nblankets, and the dead, dry leaves of autumn heaped together; and\r\nlucky was he who got the place nearest the fire, or could put the\r\nmossy trunk of a fallen tree between him and the biting blast, or,\r\nbetter still, could boast a bearskin for his bed. A little before\r\nsunset, they would halt for the night in some sheltered spot,\r\nconvenient to a running stream; where, turning their horses loose to\r\ngraze till morning, they would build a cheerful fire of the dry\r\nbrushwood close at hand, and prepare their evening meal, which they\r\nwould eat with a keenness of appetite known only to the tired and\r\nhungry hunter. Each man was his own cook; their food consisting\r\nchiefly of venison and wild turkey their rifles procured them, and\r\nfish drawn from the neighboring brook, which they would broil on the\r\nglowing coals, fastened to a forked stick instead of a spit, and then\r\neat it from a maple chip, instead of a dish. If the season permitted\r\nthem to add to this a hatful of berries that grew on the sunny side of\r\nthe hill, or acorns from the mountain-oak, or nuts from the\r\nhickory-tree, or, more delicious still, plums, persimmons, and\r\npawpaws, that grew in the more open parts of the woods, they made of\r\nit a dainty feast indeed.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in the course of this rambling life in the wilderness,\r\nthey met with roving bands of skin-clad Indians, either as warriors\r\nout upon the war-path against some distant tribe, or as hunters\r\nroaming the forest in quest of game. One evening, late, as our little\r\nparty of surveyors were about to encamp for the night, they spied\r\nthrough the trees the glimmering light of a large fire on the top of a\r\nfar-off hill. Curious to know who, besides themselves, could be in\r\nthat lonely place, they determined to go thither before stopping; and,\r\nguided by the light, reached ere long the spot, where they found a\r\nsmall squad of Indian hunters, resting themselves after the fatigues\r\nof the day's chase. They seemed to be in high good humor, as if the\r\nhunt had gone well with them that day; and, being in this mood,\r\nextended a true Indian welcome to the new-comers; setting before them,\r\nwith open-handed hospitality, heaps of parched corn, and their\r\nchoicest bits of venison, wild turkey, bear's meat, and fish. Supper\r\nended, the pipe of peace and good-will passed from mouth to mouth, as\r\na pledge that all should go on well between them; after which the\r\nIndians, for the further entertainment of their white guests, and as a\r\nmore marked manner of showing their respect, set about preparing\r\nthemselves for a war-dance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they cleared the ground around the fire of chunks\r\nand brushwood, and other obstructions that might hinder the free play\r\nof their feet and legs in the performance. Then the two musicians\r\nbegan to put in order and tune their instruments: that is to say, one\r\nof them filled a camp-kettle half full of water, over which he tightly\r\nstretched a raw-hide, and, tapping it twice or thrice with a stick,\r\ndrew forth a hollow, smothered sound therefrom, by way of giving to\r\nthose not in the secret a hint that this was to be their drum; while\r\nthe other made a rattle by putting a few bullets or pebbles into a\r\nhard, dry gourd of monstrous size, to the handle of which he fastened\r\na horse's tail, not so much to improve its tone perhaps, as to give it\r\na more finished appearance.\r\n\r\nThese simple preparations soon completed, a tall warrior, grimly\r\npainted as if for battle, advanced a few paces into the circle, and,\r\nsquatting upon his haunches, fixed his eyes for several moments with a\r\nhard, stony look upon nothing whatever, till the first tap of the drum\r\nand the first jerk of the rattle, when he suddenly leaped up, with a\r\ndeafening yell that made the old woods ring again, and began capering\r\nabout in the most astonishing manner, causing such a commotion among\r\nthe dry leaves and dead twigs as made it appear that a little\r\nwhirlwind had all at once been let loose among them. Another soon\r\nfollowed, and got up a similar sensation among the dry leaves and dead\r\ntwigs on his own private account; while a third, springing into the\r\ncircle, did the same; and so on, until at last the whole party were\r\nhot in the dance. Some brandished their scalping-knives, some\r\nflourished their tomahawks, some waved aloft the scalps of their\r\nenemies taken in battle; all yelling the while, and all making\r\nhorrible faces. And warmer and warmer they waxed in the dance, and\r\nround and round they went; now up in the air, now down on the ground;\r\njumping and kicking, yelping and barking, spinning and whirling,\r\nyelling and howling, like a pack of hobgoblins and imps on a spree.\r\nThe hollow woods gave back the barbarous din in a thousand\r\nobstreperous echoes; and afar off, from the depths of the lonely\r\nforest glens, might have been heard, had not the attention of the\r\nspectators been otherwise engaged, the answering howl of the hungry\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nAfter some time spent in this outlandish amusement, without any\r\nprevious notice whatever, plump down they sat, and, in a minute, were\r\nsmoking their pipes with as much gravity and composure as if they had\r\njust come in from a gentle promenade with their wives and children\r\nalong the banks of a smooth and tranquil river. It was a sight, once\r\nseen, never to be forgotten. At first, George and his friends had\r\nlooked on with open-eyed amazement; but, before the dance was ended,\r\nthe whole scene appeared to them so comical, that they had need of all\r\ntheir self-control to keep a sober countenance, so as not to give\r\noffence to their savage entertainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SURVEYOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious region of stately woods, fertile valleys, clear\r\nrunning streams, and lofty mountains, where our young surveyor, with\r\nthe exception of the winter months, spent the next three years of his\r\nlife. At first, not being accustomed to such severe privations and\r\nexposure, it had gone rather hard with him: but he soon became inured\r\nto them; and it was, no doubt, to this rough experience in the\r\nwilderness, that he owed, in large measure, his uncommon vigor and\r\nactivity of body, and that firm reliance on the resources of his own\r\nmind, which enabled him to endure and overcome those hardships,\r\ntrials, and difficulties which beset him throughout the greater\r\nportion of his after-life. This severe training was also of another\r\nadvantage to him, in making him perfectly familiar with all that\r\nregion, in whose dark retreats and rugged wilds he learned, a few\r\nyears later, his first hard lessons in the art of war.\r\n\r\nWith all its privations, it was a life he loved to lead; for it\r\nafforded him the means of an independent support: and a happy boy was\r\nhe, when first he wrote his mother that he was earning from fifteen\r\nto twenty dollars for every day he worked. Besides this, the beauty\r\nand grandeur of Nature's works, everywhere visible around him,\r\nawakened in him feelings of the truest delight; and he would sometimes\r\nspend the better part of a summer's day in admiring the tall and\r\nstately trees, whose spreading branches were his only shelter from the\r\ndews of heaven, and heat of noonday. At night, after supper, when his\r\ncompanions would be talking over the adventures of the day just past,\r\nor laughing boisterously at some broad joke repeated for the hundredth\r\ntime, or would be joining their voices in the chorus of some rude\r\nwoodland song, our young surveyor would be sitting a little apart on\r\nthe trunk of a fallen tree, pencil and paper before him, calculating\r\nwith a grave countenance, and by the ruddy light of a blazing\r\npine-knot, the results of the day's labor. With no other companionship\r\nthan that of the wild Indians he fell in with from time to time, and\r\nthe rude, unlettered hunters around him, he must needs turn for\r\nsociety to the thoughts that stirred within his own mind. Often would\r\nhe withdraw himself from the noisy mirth of his companions, and,\r\nclimbing to some lofty mountain-top, spend hours and hours rapt in the\r\ncontemplation of the wild and varied region, smiling in life and\r\nbeauty far, far beneath him. At such times, we can imagine his\r\ncountenance lit up with a sacred joy, and his soul rising in praise\r\nand thanksgiving to the great Father, who, in love and wisdom, made\r\nthis glorious world for the good and happiness of all that dwell\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nNow and then, for the sake of a refreshing change, he would leave the\r\nwilderness behind him, with all its toils and dangers, and betake him\r\nto Greenway Court, the woodland home of old Lord Fairfax, with whom he\r\nhad become a great favorite, and was ever a welcome guest. Here he\r\nwould spend a few weeks in the most agreeable manner you can well\r\nimagine; for the old lord, being a man of some learning and extensive\r\nreading, had collected, in the course of a long life, a large library\r\nof the best and rarest books, from which, during these three years,\r\nGeorge derived great pleasure and much valuable information. Besides\r\nthis, a keener fox-hunter than this odd old bachelor was not to be\r\nfound in all the Old Dominion; and, for the full enjoyment of this\r\nsport, he always kept a pack of hounds of the purest English blood. At\r\nthe first peep of dawn, the cheerful notes of the hunter's horn, and\r\nthe deep-mouthed baying of the fox-hounds, filling the neighboring\r\nwoods with their lively din, would call our young surveyor from his\r\nslumbers to come and join in the sports of the morning. Waiting for no\r\nsecond summons, he would be up and out in a trice, and mounted by the\r\nside of the merry old lord; when, at a signal wound on the bugle, the\r\nwhole party would dash away, pell-mell, helter-skelter, over the hills\r\nand through the woods, up the hills and down them again, across the\r\nbrooks and along the winding river; hunters and horses hard on the\r\nheels of the hounds, hounds hard on the heels of poor Renard, and poor\r\nRenard cutting, cutting away for dear life.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years thus employed, George made his home at Mount\r\nVernon, it being nearer and more convenient to his field of labor;\r\nbut, as often as his business would permit, he would go on a visit to\r\nhis mother at the old homestead on the Rappahannock, whither, as I\r\nshould have told you before now, his father had removed when he was\r\nbut three or four years old. These were precious opportunities, ever\r\nimproved by him, of extending to her that aid in the management of her\r\nfamily affairs, which to receive from him was her greatest pleasure,\r\nas well as his truest delight to give.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, he formed a habit of writing down in a diary or\r\nday-book such facts and observations as seemed to him worthy of note,\r\nby which means he would be enabled to fix firmly in his mind whatever\r\nmight prove of use to him at a future day. This is a most excellent\r\nhabit; and I would earnestly advise all young persons, desirous of\r\nincreasing their stock of knowledge, to form it as soon as they begin\r\nthe study of grammar and can write a good round hand. The following is\r\na specimen of this diary, written by him at the age of sixteen, as you\r\nwill see by the date therein given:--\r\n\r\n     \"March 13th, 1748.--Rode to his lordship's (Lord Fairfax's)\r\n     quarter. About four miles higher up the Shenandoah, we went\r\n     through most beautiful groves of sugar-trees, and spent the\r\n     better part of the day in admiring the trees and richness of\r\n     the land.\r\n\r\n     \"14th.--We sent our baggage to Capt. Hite's, near Fredericktown;\r\n     and went ourselves down the river about sixteen miles (the\r\n     land exceedingly rich all the way, producing abundance of\r\n     grain, hemp, and tobacco), in order to lay off some land on\r\n     Cole's Marsh and Long Marsh.\r\n\r\n     \"15th.--Worked hard till night, and then returned. After\r\n     supper, we were lighted into a room; and I, not being so good a\r\n     woodsman as the rest, stripped myself very orderly, and went\r\n     into the bed, as they called it; when, to my surprise, I found\r\n     it to be nothing but a little straw matted together, without\r\n     sheet or any thing else, but only one threadbare blanket, with\r\n     double its weight of vermin, I was glad to get up and put on my\r\n     clothes, and lie as my companions did. Had we not been very\r\n     tired, I am sure we should not have slept much that night. I\r\n     made a promise to sleep so no more; choosing rather to sleep in\r\n     the open air, before a fire.\r\n\r\n     \"18th.--We travelled to Thomas Berwick's on the Potomac, where\r\n     we found the river exceedingly high, by reason of the great\r\n     rains that had fallen among the Alleghanies. They told us it\r\n     would not be fordable for several days; it being now six feet\r\n     higher than usual, and rising. We agreed to stay till Monday.\r\n     We this day called to see the famed Warm Springs. We camped out\r\n     in the field this night.\r\n\r\n     \"20th.--Finding the river not much abated, we in the evening\r\n     swam our horses over to the Maryland side.\r\n\r\n     \"21st.--We went over in a canoe, and travelled up the Maryland\r\n     side all day, in a continued rain, to Col. Cresap's, over\r\n     against the mouth of the South Branch, about forty miles from\r\n     the place of starting in the morning, and over the worst road,\r\n     I believe, that ever was trod by man or beast.\"\r\n\r\nIn this diary, he also entered such items as these,--the number of\r\nacres of each lot of land surveyed, the quality of the soil, the\r\ngrowth of plants and trees, the height of the hills, the extent of the\r\nvalleys, and the length, breadth, and course of the streams. From the\r\nitems thus collected, he would draw the materials for the reports it\r\nwas his duty to submit, from time to time, for examination, to his\r\npatron or employer; and such was the clearness, brevity, and exactness\r\ndisplayed therein, and such the industry, skill, and fidelity with\r\nwhich he performed his toilsome and difficult task, that the generous\r\nold lord not only rewarded him handsomely for his services, but\r\ncontinued to cherish for him through life a truly fatherly affection.\r\n\r\nIn after-years, Washington was wont to turn with peculiar fondness to\r\nthis period of his life, as perhaps affording the only leisure he had\r\never known for sentimental musings, and the indulgence of what fancy\r\nhe may have had in those bright visions of future happiness, fame, or\r\nenterprise; to which all men are more or less given during the\r\nimmature years of youth. This, to my mind, is to be easily enough\r\naccounted for, if we but ascribe it to a certain little circumstance;\r\nconcerning which, as it exercised no small influence on his mind at\r\nthe time, I will now tell you all that is known, and, it may be, more\r\nthan ever can be known with possible certainty.\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written by him at the age of fifteen, and also from some\r\nsad and plaintive verses of his own composition found in his\r\ncopy-book, we learn that the boy, who should grow to become the\r\ngreatest man that ever made this glorious world of ours more glorious\r\nwith his wise precepts and virtuous example, was at this time a victim\r\nof the tender passion called _love_, of which most of you little folks\r\nas yet know nothing but the four letters that spell the word.\r\n\r\nThe object of this early attachment was a damsel, of whom nothing\r\ncertain is known, as her name, from the fact of its never being\r\nrepeated above a whisper, has not come down to our day, but who was\r\ncalled by him in his confidential correspondence the Lowland Beauty.\r\nAs he had none of that self-assurance which lads of his age are apt to\r\nmistake for pluck or spirit, he never ventured to make known the\r\nsecret of this passion to the object thereof; and it is probable, that\r\nwe, even at the big end of a hundred years, are wiser as to this\r\ntender passage of his life than was ever the young lady herself. Not\r\nhaving the courage to declare the sentiments that warmed his breast,\r\nhe wisely resolved to banish them from his mind altogether; and this,\r\nI will venture to say, was one reason why he so readily accepted of\r\nold Lord Fairfax's offer, and was willing for so long a time to make\r\nhis abiding-place in the wilderness. But it was months, and even\r\nyears, before he could get the better of his weakness, if such it\r\ncould be justly called; for a wilderness, let me tell you (and I hope\r\nthe hint will not be lost on my little friends), is the last place in\r\nthe world, that a man, or a boy either, should take to, as the\r\nreadiest means of ridding himself of such troublesome feelings. No\r\nwonder, then, that our young surveyor was grave and thoughtful beyond\r\nhis years; and that the lonely forest, with its ever-changing beauties\r\nand wild seclusion, viewed through the bewitched eyes of love, should\r\nhave had greater charms for him than the noisy, bustling haunts of\r\nmen. That you may have a more distinct idea of the appearance of\r\nWashington at the time of which we are speaking, your Uncle Juvinell\r\nwill conjure up, from the lingering lights and shadows of his dull old\r\nfancy, a little picture, to be gilded anew by your bright young\r\nfancies, and hung up in that loftiest chamber of your memory which you\r\nare wont to adorn with your portraits of the good and great men and\r\nwomen who have blessed the earth, and of whom we love so much to read\r\nand hear.\r\n\r\nIt is a summer morning, and the eastern mountains fling their shadows\r\nlong and huge across the lonesome valleys. Our little party of\r\nsurveyors, having spent the night on the summits of one of the less\r\nlofty peaks of the Blue Ridge, are slowly descending its shrubby skies\r\nto the more densely wooded parts of the wilderness below, of whose\r\nwaste fertility many a broad tract have they yet to explore, and many\r\na mile of boundary-line have chain and compass yet to measure and\r\ndetermine. Still lingering on the summit far above, as loath to quit\r\nthe contemplation of the splendid prospect seen from thence, stands a\r\ntall youth of eighteen, with his right arm thrown across his horse's\r\nneck, and his left hand grasping his compass-staff. He is clad in a\r\nbuckskin hunting-shirt, with leggins and moccasons of the same\r\nmaterial,--the simple garb of a backwoodsman, and one that well\r\nbecomes him now, as in perfect keeping with the wildness of the\r\nsurrounding scenery; while in his broad leathern belt are stuck his\r\nlong hunting-knife and Indian tomahawk. In stature he is much above\r\nmost youths of the same age: he is of a handsome and robust form, with\r\nhigh and strong but smooth features, light-brown hair, large blue\r\neyes,--not brilliant, but beaming with a clear and steady light, as if\r\na soul looked through them that knew no taint of vice or\r\nmeanness,--and a countenance all glorious with a truth and courage,\r\nmodest gentleness, and manly self-reliance; and as he thus lingers on\r\nthat lonely mountain-height, glorified as it were with the fresh pure\r\nlight of the newly risen sun, with head uncovered and looks reverent,\r\nhe seems in holy communion with his Maker, to whom, in the tender,\r\nguileless years of childhood, a pious mother taught him to kneel,\r\nmorning and evening, in prayer, thanksgiving, and adoration.\r\n\r\nAnon, his morning devotions ended, he turns to take, ere following his\r\ncompanions down the mountain, another view of the varied panorama\r\nspread out far beneath him, the chief feature of which is a valley,\r\nsurpassing in beauty and fertility any that that summer's sun will\r\nshine on ere reaching his golden gateway in the west. Through this\r\nvalley, glimmering, half seen, half hid among the waving woods, runs a\r\nriver, with many a graceful bend, so beautiful, that, in the far-away\r\nyears of the past, some long-forgotten tribe of Indians called it\r\nShenandoah, or Shining Daughter of the Stars; a name that still\r\nlingers like a sweet echo among the mountains. And as the eyes of the\r\nyoung surveyor slowly range the wide prospect from point to point, and\r\ntake in miles and miles of beauty at a single stretch of view, there\r\nis a look in them as if he would recall some pleasing dream of the\r\nnight, which he would now fain bring forth, though but a dream, to\r\nrefine and elevate the thoughts wherewith his mind must needs be\r\noccupied throughout the day. He is familiar with every feature of the\r\nlandscape before him: he knows each shady dell and sunny hill, and\r\nevery grassy slope and winding stream; for there he has made his home\r\nthis many a day. He has seen it all a thousand times, and each time\r\nwith renewed delight. But now it has a glory not all its own, nor\r\nborrowed from the morning sun, but from the first warm light of\r\nyouthful love that burns in his heart for his Lowland Beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nFIRST MILITARY APPOINTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the Indians inhabiting that vast region extending\r\nfrom the Ohio River to the great lakes of the north, secretly\r\nencouraged and aided by the French, began to show signs of hostility,\r\nand threatened the western borders of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New\r\nYork, with all the dismal horrors of their bloody and wasting warfare.\r\nThe alarm spread rapidly from the frontier even to the Atlantic coast,\r\ntill the whole country was awakened to the sense of the impending\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nTo put the Province of Virginia in a better posture of defence, the\r\ngovernor thereof, Robert Dinwiddie, besides other measures, divided it\r\ninto four grand military districts. Over each of these he placed what\r\nis called an adjutant-general, whose duty it was to organize and train\r\nthe militia, instruct the officers in matters touching the art and\r\nscience of war, to review the different companies when on parade, and\r\nto inspect their arms and accoutrements, and see that they were kept\r\nready for use at a moment's warning.\r\n\r\nThe energy, fidelity, and soundness of judgment, that young Washington\r\nhad lately shown while acting as surveyor, had won for him a name in\r\nthe colony; and, becoming known to Governor Dinwiddie, he was\r\nappointed by that gentleman adjutant-general of the Northern district;\r\nreceiving along with his commission the rank of major, which entitled\r\nhim to the salary of seven hundred and fifty dollars a year. You have\r\nalready seen what great delight he took in martial exercises when a\r\nschool-boy; and, now that he was to become a soldier in the true sense\r\nof the term, you will not be surprised to learn that this appointment\r\nwas altogether agreeable to his present taste and inclinations. To\r\nshow his deep sense of the honor done him, and the trust and\r\nconfidence reposed in him, he determined to perform his work well and\r\nfaithfully as far as in him lay.\r\n\r\nThe better to qualify himself for the duties of his office, he placed\r\nhimself under the instruction of his brother Lawrence, and other\r\nofficers living in that part of the province, who had served under\r\nAdmiral Vernon during the late Spanish war. These gentlemen, besides\r\ngiving him the benefit of their experience and observation, placed in\r\nhis hands the best works on military science then in use; from which\r\nhe learned the various modes of training militia, the different\r\nmanoeuvres of an army on the field of battle, and their management\r\nwhile on the line of march, together with the most approved plans of\r\nbuilding forts, throwing up intrenchments and redoubts, and the\r\nconstruction of other works of defence, whether of wood or earth or\r\nstone. At the same time, he also made himself acquainted with the\r\nhandling and design of many weapons and engines of war; and under the\r\ninstruction of Capt. Van Braam, a Dutch fencing-master, he became very\r\nskilful in the use of the sword. Thus Mount Vernon, from being the\r\nquiet mansion of a country gentleman, was now, in a manner, converted\r\ninto a military school; and the youth, who but a few years before, as\r\nhe strolled among its verdant retreats, had, in honor of his Lowland\r\nBeauty, made his first and only attempt of putting his thoughts and\r\nfeelings in verse, was, at the early age of nineteen, called upon to\r\ndischarge those stern duties which men of age and experience alone are\r\ngenerally thought able to perform. The district allotted to Major\r\nWashington (for so we must now call him) consisted of several large\r\ncounties, each of which the duties of his office obliged him to visit\r\nfrom time to time; and such was the energy and spirit he carried into\r\nhis work, and such ability did he display, and such was the manliness\r\nand dignified courtesy with which he deported himself on all\r\noccasions, that he soon completely won the confidence and affections\r\nof both officers and men, who were inspired by his example to still\r\ngreater zeal and patriotism in the service of their country.\r\n\r\nBut these labors, so agreeable to one of his age and ardent spirit,\r\nwere now interrupted for several months. His brother Lawrence, who\r\nhad always been of a delicate constitution, was now thought to be in\r\nthe last stages of consumption, and was advised by his physicians to\r\nbetake himself to the West Indies, where he might yet, perhaps, find\r\nsome relief in the warmer suns and milder airs of those beautiful\r\nislands. As he would have need of cheerful company and gentle and\r\ncareful nursing, he took with him his favorite brother George; and,\r\nembarking from Alexandria, was soon out upon the shining billows of\r\nthe deep-blue sea, in quest of that health he was never again to find.\r\nTheir place of destination was the charming little Island of\r\nBarbadoes, where, after a somewhat stormy voyage, they arrived in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWhile here, Major Washington had an attack of small-pox, which handled\r\nhim rather severely; and for some time he was thought to be in a\r\ndangerous condition. But in a few weeks, by dint of careful nursing,\r\njoined to the natural vigor of his constitution, he got the better of\r\nthis frightful malady; and, when he was completely restored, not a\r\ndisfiguring trace of it remained.\r\n\r\nDuring his sojourn here, he still continued his habit of writing down\r\nin a journal whatever of importance or interest came under his\r\nobservation; in which, among other items, we find such as the\r\nfollowing,--the speed of the ship in which they sailed; the direction\r\nof the winds; some account of a storm that overtook them on their\r\nvoyage; the cities, ships, forts, and military strength of the Island\r\nof Barbadoes; its products; manners and customs of the people, and the\r\nlaws and government under which they lived. By this means,\r\ncontributing as it did to habits of close and accurate observation, he\r\nimpressed the more strongly upon his memory such facts as might prove\r\nof use to him at a future day.\r\n\r\nOur two Virginians, during the three or four months of their stay on\r\nthe island, were treated with much courtesy and hospitality by the\r\ninhabitants. But neither the genial climate of the region, nor the\r\nkindly hospitality of the people, was enough to restore that health\r\nand strength to the invalid for which he had come so far and hoped so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nFeeling that his end was drawing nigh, Lawrence Washington resolved to\r\nhasten home, that he might have the melancholy satisfaction of\r\nspending his last moments in the midst of his family and friends. He\r\nhad scarcely returned to Mount Vernon, and bid a fond farewell to the\r\nloved ones there, when the angel of death summoned him to take another\r\nand a longer voyage, in quest of immortality, to be found in the\r\nislands of the blest, that smile in never-fading beauty on the bosom\r\nof the eternal sea.\r\n\r\nThus, at the early age of thirty-four, died Lawrence Washington, one\r\nof the most amiable and accomplished gentlemen of his day. He left\r\nbehind him an affectionate wife, a sweet little daughter, a devoted\r\nbrother, and many a loving friend, to mourn his loss. In his will, he\r\nbequeathed his fine estate of Mount Vernon and all else that he\r\npossessed to his brother George; on condition, however, that his wife\r\nshould have the use of it during her lifetime, and that his daughter\r\nshould die without children to inherit it. The daughter did not reach\r\nthe years of maidenhood; and, the mother surviving but a few years,\r\nGeorge was left in the undivided possession of a large and handsome\r\nproperty; and, in a worldly point of view, his fortune was really\r\nalready made. But, for all that, he long and deeply mourned the death\r\nof this much loved and valued brother, who had been to him father and\r\nfriend ever since that first great sorrow of his childhood, when he\r\nbecame a widow's son and a widow's blessing.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my little children, I have told you the story of this great\r\nand good man's life from his years of infancy up to those of early\r\nmanhood. I have dwelt at greater length upon this period of his life\r\nthan perhaps any other historian, and have told you some things that\r\nyou might look for elsewhere in vain. In my treatment of this part of\r\nthe subject, it has been my chief aim and earnest desire to impress\r\nupon your opening minds this one great truth,--that, if you would be\r\ngood and wise in your manhood, you must begin, now in early youth, to\r\nput forth all your powers, and use all the means within your reach, to\r\nstore your mind with useful knowledge, and direct your thoughts and\r\nactions in the ways of truth and virtue, industry and sobriety. The\r\nboy Washington did all this; and, ere we have done, you shall see the\r\nglorious results of such a good beginning. Be like him in your\r\nyouth,--patient and diligent, loving and dutiful, truthful and\r\nprayerful; that you may be like him in the fulness of years,--esteemed\r\nand beloved, happy and good, useful and wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT EXPLANATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Juvinell had finished this part of his story, he paused,\r\nand with a beaming face looked round upon his little circle of\r\nlisteners. Two or three of the youngest had long since fallen asleep;\r\nand Master Ned, having heard the story of the little hatchet, had\r\nstolen quietly away to the cabin, just to see how \"black daddy\" was\r\ngetting along with his sled. Having waited till it was finished, he\r\nhad, for his own private amusement, taken it to a nice hillside, and\r\nwas now coasting on it all alone by the light of a good-humored,\r\ndish-faced moon. The other children had listened with great interest\r\nand attention to the story, and were still sitting with their eyes\r\nbent earnestly on the fire, whose great bright eye had by this time\r\ngrown a little red, and was winking in a slow and sleepy way, as if it\r\nwere saying, \"Well done, Uncle Juvinell,--very well done indeed. I\r\nhave been listening very attentively, and quite approve of all you\r\nhave said, especially all that about the wooden-legged schoolmaster,\r\nthe little hatchet, the sorrel horse, the Indian war-dance, and the\r\nLowland Beauty, not to mention those wise maxims and wholesome moral\r\nprecepts you brought in so aptly. All of it is very fine and very\r\ngood, and just to my liking. But I am thinking it is high bed-time for\r\nthese little folks.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Juvinell was much gratified to see how deeply interested the\r\nchildren were in what he had been telling them; and in a little while\r\nhe called upon them to let him know how they all liked it. Laura said\r\nthat it was very nice; Ella, that it was charming; Daniel, that it was\r\nquite as interesting as Plutarch's Lives; Willie, that it was even\r\nmore so than \"Robinson Crusoe;\" and Bryce, that it was very good, but\r\nhe would have liked it better had Uncle Juvinell told them more about\r\nthe Indians. Just then, Master Charlie awoke from a comfortable nap of\r\nan hour or two, having dropped asleep shortly after the sorrel horse\r\ndropped dead; and, to make believe that he had been as wide awake as a\r\nweasel from the very start, began asking such a string of questions as\r\nseemed likely to have no end. After a droll jumbling of Washington\r\nwith Jack the Giant-killer, old Lord Fairfax with Bluebeard, poor old\r\nHobby, the wooden-legged schoolmaster, with the Roving Red Robber, he\r\nat last so far got the better of his sleepy senses as to know what he\r\nwould be driving at; when he said, \"Uncle Juvinell, did his father let\r\nhim keep his little hatchet after he had cut the cherry-tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"History, my little nephew,\" replied his uncle with a sober\r\ncountenance, \"does not inform us whether he did or not; but you may be\r\nquite sure that he did, well knowing that a little boy who would\r\nchoose rather to take a whipping than tell a lie, or suffer another to\r\nbe punished for an offence he had himself committed, would never be\r\nguilty the second time of doing that wherein he had once been\r\nforbidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of black Jerry after he turned a somerset in the snow,\r\nand went rolling over and over down the hill?\" Charlie went on.\r\n\r\n\"Jerry, I am happy to say,\" replied his uncle, \"was so won over by the\r\nkindness and noble self-devotion of his brave little master, that he\r\nmade up his mind to mend his ways from that very moment; and in a\r\nshort time, from having been the worst, became the best behaved\r\nnegroling to be found on either side of the Rappahannock, for more\r\nthan a hundred miles up and down.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a negroling?\" inquired Master Charlie, as if bent on sifting\r\nthis matter to the very bottom.\r\n\r\n\"A negroling,\" replied Uncle Juvinell with a smile, \"is to a\r\nfull-grown negro what a gosling is to a full-grown goose. Now, can you\r\ntell me what it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gosling negro, I suppose,\" was Charlie's answer; and then he asked,\r\n\"Did old Hobby go on teaching school after little George left him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did,\" answered his uncle; \"but, you may depend upon it,\r\nhe never took another scholar as far as the single rule of three.\"\r\nThen, winking slyly at two or three of the older children, he\r\ncontinued: \"This worthy schoolmaster lived to the good old age of\r\nninety-nine; when, feeling that his earthly pilgrimage was drawing to\r\na close, he for the last time hung up his big cocked hat on the\r\naccustomed peg, and for the last time unscrewed his wooden, leg, and\r\nset it in its accustomed corner; then, like a good Christian, laid him\r\ndown to die in peace, giving thanks to Heaven with his last breath\r\nthat it had fallen to his lot to teach the great George Washington his\r\nA B C's and the multiplication-table.\"\r\n\r\nThis made Master Charlie look very grave and thoughtful, so that he\r\nasked no more questions for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nThen Daniel, the young historian, who, having his mind occupied with\r\nmore weighty matters, had been listening with some impatience while\r\nthe above confab was going on, begged that his uncle would tell him\r\nwhat was meant by a midshipman's warrant.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, Dannie,\" said Uncle Juvinell, \"for the benefit of\r\nthe rest of the children, who are not so well informed upon such\r\nmatters as yourself, we must see what a midshipman is. The lowest\r\nofficer in the navy, but still several degrees removed from a common\r\nsailor, is a midshipman, who enters a man-of-war as a kind of pupil\r\nto study the art of navigation, and to acquaint himself with other\r\nmatters connected with the seafaring life. A man-of-war, you must\r\nknow, is the largest vessel, or ship of war, belonging to a nation;\r\nwhile all the ships fitted out at the public expense, together with\r\nthe officers and seamen concerned in their keeping and management,\r\nmake up what is called a navy. By navigation, we are to understand the\r\nart by which sailors are taught to conduct ships from one point to\r\nanother. Now, a warrant is a writing that gives some one the right to\r\ndo a thing or to enjoy it. Thus you see a midshipman's warrant would\r\nhave given young Washington the right to go on board a man-of-war,\r\nwhere, as a kind of pupil, he would have learned the art of\r\nnavigation, the management of ships, and many other things necessary\r\nto make a good sailor. The knowledge thus acquired, and the training\r\nto which he must needs have been subjected, would have fitted him in\r\ntime to become an officer of the navy, such as a lieutenant or a\r\ncaptain, and, it may be, even an admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is an admiral?\" inquired Willie.\r\n\r\n\"An admiral,\" replied Uncle Juvinell, \"is the highest officer of the\r\nnavy; he is to the armies of the sea what a general is to the armies\r\nof the land, and commands a squadron, or fleet, which, you must know,\r\nis a large number of armed ships, moving and acting in concert\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he fight with a sword?\" inquired Bryce, who, it must be borne in\r\nmind, was the military young gentleman, who carried a wooden sword of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\"It is unusual,\" replied his uncle, \"for either an admiral or a\r\ngeneral to fight in person; it being their duty to put their armies in\r\norder of battle, and afterwards, during the fight, to control the\r\nmovements of the different regiments or divisions by orders carried by\r\naides to the officers under their command.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told us, uncle,\" said Willie, \"that Washington received, along\r\nwith the commission of adjutant-general, the rank of major. Now, what\r\nare we to understand by this?\"\r\n\r\n\"A commission,\" replied his uncle, \"is a writing, giving some one the\r\nright or authority to perform the duties of some office, and receive\r\nthe pay and honors arising from the same. The duties of an\r\nadjutant-general you have already seen; and the commission received by\r\nyoung Washington to perform those duties made him equal in rank, not\r\nto a general, but to a major.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you told us, uncle,\" said Ella, \"what is meant by surveying;\r\nbut I don't think that I clearly understand it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will refer you to your brother Dannie,\" said Uncle Juvinell; \"for\r\nhe is looking very wise, as if somebody knew a thing or two, and\r\ncould, were he but called upon, greatly enlighten somebody else. Out\r\nwith it, Dannie, and let us have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surveying teaches the measurement of land,\" Dannie made haste to\r\nanswer; \"and a surveyor is one who measures land with the help of a\r\nlong chain and compass and other instruments. Now, George Washington,\r\nfor example\"--\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Daniel,\" said his uncle, interrupting him: \"you have\r\nmade it as clear as daylight already; and I dare say your sister\r\nunderstands you perfectly, without the help of any example.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I like to have forgotten one thing!\" cried Willie. \"Tell us what\r\nis meant by line of march, manoeuvres on the battle-field, throwing\r\nup intrenchments, and the like.\"\r\n\r\nTo these points, Uncle Juvinell made answer: \"An army, my nephew, is\r\nsaid to be on the line of march when it is moving from one place to\r\nanother. A manoeuvre is an evolution or a movement of an army,\r\ndesigned to mislead or deceive an enemy, or in some way to gain the\r\nadvantage of him. An intrenchment is a breastwork or wall, with a\r\ntrench or ditch running along the outside. The breastwork, being\r\nformed of the earth thrown up from the trench, serves as a protection\r\nagainst the shots of an enemy. The trench being quite as deep as the\r\nbreastwork is high, renders it very difficult and dangerous for the\r\nworks to be taken by storm; for the enemy must first descend into the\r\nditch before he can reach and scale the wall,--an attempt always\r\nattended with the greatest peril to those who make it; for they who\r\ndefend the works, fighting on top of the walls, have greatly the\r\nadvantage of those beneath. Sometimes intrenchments run in straight or\r\ncrooked lines, and sometimes enclose an irregular square or circle;\r\nand any piece of ground, or body of men, thus enclosed or fortified,\r\nis said to be intrenched.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity it is we can never know the name of the Lowland Beauty!\"\r\nremarked Miss Laura regretfully; for she was getting to be quite old\r\nenough to be somewhat interested in matters of this kind.\r\n\r\n\"The name the young surveyor gave her,\" said Uncle Juvinell, \"lends an\r\ninterest to this part of his life, which a knowledge of her true name\r\nmight never have awakened. Besides this, my dear niece, if you but be\r\nattentive to what I shall relate hereafter, you will learn many things\r\ntouching the life and character of his mother Mary and his wife Martha\r\nfar more worthy of your remembrance.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock struck ten; the fire burned low, and a heavy lid of ashes\r\nhid its great red eye. And now Uncle Juvinell bethought him that it\r\nmust indeed be high bed-time for the little folks; and in conclusion\r\nhe said, \"Now, my dear children, I want you to bear well in mind what\r\nI have told you to-night, that you may be the better prepared for what\r\nI shall tell you to-morrow evening. And hereafter I would have you\r\nwrite down on your slates, while I go on with my story, whatever you\r\nmay find difficult and shall wish to have more fully explained at the\r\nend of each evening's lesson. And now let us sing our evening hymn,\r\nand part for the night.\"\r\n\r\nWith that they joined their voices, as was their wont, in a sweet hymn\r\nof praise and thanks to the great Father of us all,--the little folks\r\ncarrying the treble, while Uncle Juvinell managed the bass. This duly\r\ndone, they came one by one, and kissed their dear old uncle a loving\r\ngood-night; then crept to their happy beds to dream till morning of\r\nwooden-legged schoolmasters, little hatchets, wild rides on fiery\r\nuntamed horses that were always sorrel, of life in the lonely\r\nwilderness, rambles without end up and down the mountains, and of\r\nskin-clad Indiana leaping and whirling in the war-dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nINDIAN TROUBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, said Uncle Juvinell, I see you are all agog, slate and pencil\r\nin hand, ready to jot down any question that may chance to pop into\r\nyour busy young brains, to be asked and answered, for our further\r\nenlightenment, at the end of our evening lesson. So, without more ado,\r\nwe will begin.\r\n\r\nBut, before trudging on further in our delightful journey, we must\r\npause a moment, and turning square round, with our faces towards the\r\nlong-ago years of the past, take a bird's-eye view of the early\r\nhistory of our country, that we may know exactly where we are when we\r\ncome to find ourselves in the outskirts of that long and bloody\r\nstruggle between the two great nations of England and France, commonly\r\ncalled the Seven Years' War, and sometimes the Old French War. Now,\r\nalthough this would not be as entertaining to your lively fancies as\r\nan Arabian tale or an Indian legend, yet you will by and by see very\r\nplainly that we could not have skipped it, without losing the sense of\r\na great deal that follows; for it was during this war that our\r\nWashington first experienced the trials and hardships of a soldier's\r\nlife, and displayed that courage, prudence, and ability, which in the\r\nend proved the salvation and glory of his native country.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you must know, my dear children, that this\r\nbeautiful land of ours, where now dwell the freest and happiest people\r\nthe blessed sun ever shone upon, was, only a few hundred years ago,\r\nall a vast unbroken wilderness; a place where no one but savage\r\nIndians found a home, whose chief amusement was to fight and kill and\r\nscalp each other; and whose chief occupation was to hunt wild beasts\r\nand birds, upon whose flesh they fed, and with whose hairy skins and\r\nhorns and claws and feathers they clothed and decked themselves. Where\r\nin the leafy summer-time may now be heard the merry plough-boy\r\nwhistling \"Yankee Doodle\" over the waving corn, the wild Indian once\r\nwrestled with the surly bear, or met his ancient enemy in deadly\r\nfight. Nibbling sheep and grazing cattle now range the grassy hills\r\nand valleys where he was wont to give chase to the timid deer, or lie\r\nin wait for the monstrous buffalo. Huge steamers ply up and down our\r\nmighty rivers where he once paddled his little canoe. Splendid cities\r\nhave risen, as if at the rubbing of Aladdin's enchanted lamp, where in\r\nthe depths of the forest he once kindled the great council-fire, and\r\nmet the neighboring tribes in the Big Talk. The very schoolhouse,\r\nwhere you little folks are now tripping so lightly along the flowery\r\npath of knowledge, may perhaps stand on the selfsame shady slope,\r\nwhere, of a long summer evening, he would sit at the door of his\r\nbark-built wigwam, smoking his long pipe, and watching his naked red\r\nchildren with a more fatherly smile than you can well imagine in one\r\nso fierce, as with many a hoop and yelp they played at \"hide-and-seek\"\r\namong the gray old trees and pawpaw thickets. On yonder hill-top,\r\nwhere we at this moment can see the windows of the house of God\r\nshining and glancing in the moonlight, he may have stood, with his\r\nface to the rising or setting sun, in mute worship before the Great\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nBut the stronger and wiser white man came; and, at his terrible\r\napproach, the red man, with all his wild remembrances, passed away,\r\nlike an echo in the woods, or the shadow of an April cloud over the\r\nhills and valleys; and the place that once knew him shall know him no\r\nmore for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it might have been far otherwise with him and with us, had not\r\na certain Christopher Columbus chanced to light upon this Western\r\nWorld of ours, as he came hap-hazard across the wide Atlantic, where\r\nship had never sailed before, in quest of a shorter passage to Asia.\r\n\r\nBy this great discovery, it was proved to the entire satisfaction of\r\nall who are in the least interested in the matter, that this earth\r\nupon which we live, instead of being long and flat, with sides and\r\nends and corners like a great rough slab, was round, and hollow\r\ninside, like an India-rubber ball, and went rolling through empty\r\nspace, round and round the sun, year after year, continually.\r\n\r\nOf this bold and skilful sailor, the most renowned that ever lived, I\r\nshould like to tell you many things; but, as we set out to give our\r\nchief attention to the story of Washington, we must deny ourselves\r\nthis pleasure until the holidays of some merry Christmas yet to come,\r\nwhen your Uncle Juvinell, if he still keeps his memory fresh and\r\ngreen, will relate to you many wonderful things in the life of this\r\ngreat voyager, Columbus.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, all the nations of Christendom had for ages upon ages\r\nbeen sunk in a lazy doze of ignorance and superstition. But, when\r\ntidings of the great discovery reached their drowsy ears, they were\r\nroused in a marvellous manner; and many of the richest and most\r\npowerful forthwith determined to secure, each to itself, a portion of\r\nthe new-found region, by planting colonies; or, in other words, by\r\nmaking settlements therein.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, they sent out fleets of ships across the Atlantic to\r\nthese distant shores, laden with multitudes of men, who brought with\r\nthem all manner of tools and implements wherewith to clear away the\r\nforests, till the soil, and build forts and cities, and arms to defend\r\nthemselves against the attacks of the war-like savages. Thus, for\r\nexample, Spain colonized Mexico; France, Canada; and England, that\r\nstrip of the North-American continent, lying between the Alleghany\r\nMountains and the Atlantic Ocean, now known as the eastern coast of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAt first, the new-comers were received and treated with much kindness\r\nand hospitality by the natives: but it was not long before they\r\ndiscovered that they were likely to be robbed of their homes and\r\nhunting-grounds; when rage and jealousy took possession of their\r\nhearts, and from that time forward they never let slip an opportunity\r\nof doing all the mischief in their power to the hated intruders. Then\r\nbegan that long train of bloody wars between the two races, which have\r\nnever ceased except with defeat or ruin of the weaker red man, and\r\nbringing him nearer and nearer to the day when he must either forsake\r\nhis savage life, or cease to have an existence altogether.\r\n\r\nNow, this may appear very unjust and wrong to my little friends; and,\r\nto some extent, it really was: but, in those days, might made right;\r\nor, in other words, the strong ruled the weak. And yet we are bound to\r\nbelieve that all this, in the long-run, has worked, and is still\r\nworking, to the greatest good of the greatest number: for, had it been\r\notherwise, all this beautiful land, now the home of a Christian and\r\nhappy people, would have remained the dismal wilderness we have\r\ndescribed it; answering no good end, as far as concerns the spread of\r\ntruth and knowledge, and the cultivation of those useful arts which\r\nmake a nation prosperous in peace, and strong in war.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their troubles with the Indians, the hardships and\r\nprivations to which the first settlers of a wild country are always\r\nexposed, and the shameful neglect with which they were treated by the\r\nmother-countries, the French and English colonies went on growing and\r\nthriving in a way that was wonderful to behold. At the end of a\r\nhundred and fifty years, or thereabouts, they had so grown in strength\r\nand increased in numbers, and had so widened their boundaries, that at\r\nlast the continent, vast as it is, seemed too narrow to hold them\r\nboth; and they began throwing up their elbows for more room, in a\r\nmanner that would have been thought quite uncivil in a private\r\nindividual at a dinner table or in a stage-coach.\r\n\r\nWhereupon there arose a hot dispute between the kings of France and\r\nEngland as to whom belonged all that immense region stretching from\r\nthe Alleghanies to the Mississippi, in the one direction; and, in the\r\nother, from the Ohio to the Great Lakes of the North.\r\n\r\nThe French claimed it by the right of discovery: by which they meant,\r\nthat a certain Father Marquette had, nearly a hundred years before,\r\ndiscovered the Mississippi during his wanderings as a missionary\r\namong the Indians of the Far West. They pretended, that, as this pious\r\nman had paddled a little canoe up and down this splendid river a few\r\nhundred miles, his royal master, the King of France, was thereby\r\nentitled to all the lands watered by it, and the ten thousand streams\r\nthat empty into it.\r\n\r\nThe English, on the other hand, claimed it by the right of purchase;\r\nhaving, as they said, bought it at a fair price of the Six Nations, a\r\npowerful league or union of several Indian tribes inhabiting the\r\nregion round about the great lake's Erie and Ontario. What right the\r\nSix Nations had to it, is impossible to say. They claimed it, however,\r\nby the doubtful right of conquest; there being a tradition among them,\r\nthat their ancestors, many generations before, had overrun the\r\ncountry, and subdued its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNow, the poor Indians who occupied the land in question were very\r\nindignant indeed when they heard that they and theirs had been sold to\r\nthe white strangers by their red enemies, the Six Nations, whom they\r\nregarded as a flock of meddlesome crows, that were always dipping\r\ntheir ravenous bills into matters that did not in the least concern\r\nthem; and their simple heads were sorely perplexed and puzzled, that\r\ntwo great kings, dwelling in far-distant countries, thousands of miles\r\naway beyond the mighty ocean, should, in the midst of uncounted\r\nriches, fall to wrangling with each other over a bit of wilderness\r\nland that neither of them had ever set eyes or foot on, and to which\r\nthey had no more right than the Grand Caliph of Bagdad, or that\r\nterrible Tartar, Kublah Khan.\r\n\r\n\"Of all this land,\" said they, \"there is not the black of a man's\r\nthumb-nail that the Six Nations can call their own. It is ours. More\r\nthan a thousand moons before the pale-face came over the Big Water in\r\nhis white-winged canoes, the Great Spirit gave it to our forefathers;\r\nand they handed it down, to be our inheritance as long as the old\r\nhills tell of their green graves. In its streams have we fished, in\r\nits woods have we hunted, in its sunny places have we built our\r\nwigwams, and in its dark and secret places have we fought and scalped\r\nand burnt our sworn enemies, without let or hinderance, time out of\r\nmind. Now, if the English claim all on this side of the Ohio, and the\r\nFrench claim all on this side of the Big Lakes, then what they claim\r\nis one and the same country,--the country whereon we dwell. Surely our\r\nwhite brothers must be dreaming. It is our hearts' desire, that our\r\nbrothers, the English, keep on their side of the Ohio, and till the\r\nground, and grow rich in corn; also that our brothers, the French,\r\nkeep on their side of the lakes, and hunt in the woods, and grow rich\r\nin skins and furs. But you must both quit pressing upon us, lest our\r\nribs be squeezed in and our breath be squeezed out, and we cease to\r\nhave a place among men. We hold you both at arm's-length; and whoever\r\npays good heed to the words we have spoken, by him will we stand, and\r\nwith him make common cause against the other.\"\r\n\r\nBut to these just complaints of the poor Indian the French and English\r\ngave no more heed than if they who uttered them were so many\r\nwhip-poor-wills crying in the woods. So they fell to wrangling in a\r\nmore unreasonable manner than ever. Finally, to mend the matter (that\r\nis to say, make things worse), the French, coming up the Mississippi\r\nfrom the South, and down from the Great Lakes of the North, began\r\nerecting a chain of forts upon the disputed territory, to overawe the\r\ninhabitants thereof, and force the English to keep within the\r\nAlleghanies and the Atlantic. As a matter of course, the English\r\nregarded this as an insult to their dignity, and resolved to chastise\r\nthe French for their impudence. And this it was that brought about\r\nthat long and bloody struggle, the Old French War.\r\n\r\nThus, my dear children, do great and wise nations, professing to\r\nfollow the humane teachings of the man-loving, God-fearing Jesus,\r\noften show no more truth and justice and honesty in their dealings\r\nwith one another than if they were as ignorant of the Ten Commandments\r\nas the most benighted heathens, to whom even the name of Moses was\r\nnever spoken. Yet, from your looks, I see that you are wondering\r\nwithin yourselves what all this rigmarole about England, France, the\r\nSix Nations, and disputed territories, can have to do with George\r\nWashington. Had you held a tight rein on your impatience a little\r\nwhile longer, you would have found out all about it, without the\r\ninconvenience of wondering; and hereafter, my little folks, rest\r\nassured that your Uncle Juvinell never ventures upon any thing without\r\nhaving all his eyes and wits about him, and that what he may tell you\r\nshall always prove instructive, although it may now and then--with no\r\nfault of his, however--seem to you somewhat dry and tedious.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\"BIG TALK\" WITH \"WHITE THUNDER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we are a little fast. In order to bring ourselves square again\r\nwith our story, we must take one step backward, and begin afresh.\r\n\r\nWhen tidings of these trespasses of the French reached the ears of\r\nRobert Dinwiddie, then Governor of Virginia, all his Scotch blood\r\nboiled within him, and he began forthwith casting in his mind what\r\nmight be done to check or chastise such audacious proceedings.\r\n\r\nCooling down a little, however, he thought it would be better, before\r\nthrowing his stones, to try what virtue might be found in grass. By\r\nwhich you are to understand, that he determined to write a letter to\r\nthe French general, then stationed in a little fort near Lake Erie,\r\ninquiring by what authority these encroachments were made on the\r\ndominions of his royal master, the King of England; and demanding that\r\nthey, the French, should abandon their forts, and withdraw their\r\ntroops from the disputed territory, without delay, or else abide the\r\nconsequences. He was well aware, that, to insure any thing like\r\nsuccess in a mission so difficult and perilous, the person intrusted\r\nwith it must needs be robust of body, stout of heart, clear of head;\r\none inured to the hardships of a backwoods life, well acquainted with\r\nthe habits and customs of the Indians, and withal a man of\r\nintelligence, polite address, and the strictest integrity of\r\ncharacter. But one such man was to be found among ten thousand; and\r\nthis was George Washington, who answered to the description in every\r\nparticular, and was therefore chosen to perform this perilous\r\nundertaking, although he had not yet completed his twenty-second year.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having received from Governor Dinwiddie written\r\ninstructions how to act when come into the enemy's country, Major\r\nWashington set out the next morning from Williamsburg, then the\r\ncapital of Virginia, and made his way at once to Winchester, at that\r\ntime a frontier settlement of the province, lying on the very edge of\r\nthe wilderness. Here he spent several days in procuring supplies for\r\nthe expedition, and raising a small party of hunters and pioneers to\r\nguard and bear him company. After some delay, he succeeded in\r\nprocuring the services of seven men. Four of these were hardy\r\nbackwoodsmen of experience, whose business it was to take care of the\r\nbaggage and keep the party supplied with game. Mr. Davidson was to go\r\nalong as Indian interpreter, and Mr. Gist as guide. A bolder and more\r\nenterprising pioneer than this Gist, by the by, was not to be found\r\nin all the Western wilds; and he is supposed by some historians to\r\nhave been the first white man that ever brought down an elk or a\r\nbuffalo in that paradise of hunters, green Kentucky. In addition to\r\nthese, Washington took with him as French interpreter his old Dutch\r\nfencing-master, Capt. Van Braam. The worthy captain, however, seems to\r\nhave been a far more expert master of sword-play than of the\r\nlanguages; for the jargon he was pleased to call an interpretation was\r\noften such a medley of half-learned English, half-remembered French,\r\nand half-forgotten Dutch, that they who listened would be nearly as\r\nmuch perplexed to see what he would be driving at, as if he were\r\nsputtering Cherokee into their ears.\r\n\r\nAll things being at last in readiness, the gallant little party,\r\nheaded by our young Virginian, turned their faces towards the great\r\nNorth-west; and, plunging into the wilderness, were soon beyond all\r\ntraces of civilized man. The autumn was far advanced. The travelling\r\nwas rendered toilsome, and even dangerous, by the heavy rains of this\r\nseason, and early snows that had already fallen on the mountains,\r\nwhich had changed the little rills into rushing torrents, and the low\r\nbottom-lands into deep and miry swamps. Much delayed by these and the\r\nlike hinderances, Washington, upon reaching the banks of the\r\nMonongahela, deemed it best to send two of the backwoodsmen with the\r\nbaggage in canoes down this river to its mouth, where, uniting its\r\nwaters with those of the Allegheny, it helped to form the great Ohio.\r\nPromising to meet them at this point, he and the rest of the party\r\npushed thitherward by land on horseback. Reaching the Forks of the\r\nOhio two days before the canoe-men, he spent the time in exploring the\r\nwoods and hills and streams around, and was much struck with the\r\nadvantages the place held out as a site for a military post. This,\r\ntogether with other items meriting attention that happened to him or\r\noccurred to his mind during the expedition, he carefully noted down in\r\na journal which he kept, to be laid, in the form of a report, before\r\nGov. Dinwiddie, upon his return. The following year, as a convincing\r\nproof to his countrymen how entirely they might rely on his foresight\r\nand judgment in such matters, French officers of skill and experience\r\nchose this very spot to be the site of Fort Duquesne, afterwards so\r\nfamous in the border history of our country. Near the close of the\r\nwar, this post fell into the hands of the English, who changed its\r\nname to that of Fort Pitt; which in time gave rise to the busy,\r\nthriving, noisy, dingy, fine young town of Pittsburg, a smoky-looking\r\npicture of which you may see any time you choose to consult your\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nInstead of pushing on directly to the Lakes, Major Washington turned a\r\nlittle aside from his course, and went down the Ohio about twenty\r\nmiles, to an Indian village called Logstown. Here, as had been\r\npreviously arranged, he met a few sachems or chiefs of some of the\r\nWestern tribes, to kindle a council-fire and have a Big Talk. He was\r\nreceived with much hospitality and courtesy by a stately old chief,\r\nwhose Indian name you would not care to hear, as it would give Master\r\nCharlie's nut-crackers the jaw-ache to pronounce it. Among the\r\nEnglish, however, as he was the head of a league or union of several\r\ntribes, he usually went by the name of the Half King. After the pipe\r\nhad passed with all due gravity from mouth to mouth, and every\r\nwarrior, chief, and white man present had taken a whiff or two, in\r\nsign that all was good-will and peace between them, Washington arose,\r\nand addressed the Half King in a short speech, somewhat after the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n\"Your brother, the Governor of Virginia, has sent me with a letter to\r\nthe big French captain, near Lake Erie. What is written therein deeply\r\nconcerns you and your people as well as us. It was his desire,\r\ntherefore, that you share with us the toils and dangers of this\r\nexpedition, by sending some of your young men along with us, to guide\r\nus through the wilderness where there is no path, and be our safeguard\r\nagainst the wiles of cunning and evil-minded men we may chance to meet\r\nby the way. This he will look upon as a still further proof of the\r\nlove and friendship you bear your brothers, the English. As a pledge\r\nof his faith in all this, and as a token of his love for his red\r\nbrother, he sends this belt of wampum.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davidson having interpreted this speech, the Half King for some\r\nmoments after sat smoking in profound silence, as if turning over in\r\nhis mind what he had just heard, or as if waiting, according to Indian\r\nnotions of etiquette on such occasions, to assure himself that the\r\nspeaker had made an end of his say. He then arose, and spoke to the\r\nfollowing effect:--\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the words of my young white brother, and they are true.\r\nI have heard the request of my brother the Governor of Virginia, and\r\nit is reasonable. At present, however, my young men are abroad in the\r\nforest, hunting game to provide against the wants of the coming\r\nwinter, that our wives and children starve not when we are out upon\r\nthe war-path. At the third setting of the sun from this time, they\r\nwill be coming in; when I will not only send some of them with my\r\nyoung white brother, but will myself bear him company. For he must\r\nknow that we have ceased to look upon the French as our friends. They\r\nhave trespassed upon our soil; they have spoken words of insult and\r\nmockery to our oldest sachems. For this cause have my people resolved\r\nto return them the speech-belt they gave us at the Big Talk we had\r\nlast winter at Montreal. It is that I may defy the big French captain\r\nto his teeth, and fling his speech-belt in his face, that I now go\r\nwith my young brother, the Long Knife.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third day, as had been promised, the young men came in from\r\nhunting; from among whom the Half King chose eight or ten to serve as\r\nan additional escort to Major Washington during the expedition. Among\r\nthese was a warrior of great distinction, who went by the tremendous\r\nname of White Thunder, and was keeper of the speech-belt. Now, you\r\nmust know, that in Indian politics, when two tribes exchange\r\nspeech-belts, it is understood to be an expression of peace and\r\ngood-will between them; while to return or throw them away is the same\r\nas a declaration of war, or at least to be taken as a hint that all\r\nfriendly intercourse between them is at an end. The \"keeper of the\r\nspeech-belt\" was, therefore, a kind of \"secretary of state\" among\r\nthese simple people.\r\n\r\nThus re-enforced by his red allies, Washington, who had grown somewhat\r\nimpatient under this delay, gladly turned his face once more towards\r\nthe Great Lakes. All this time, the rain had continued to fall with\r\nscarcely an hour's intermission. The streams and low meadow-lands were\r\nso flooded in consequence, that they were often obliged to wander many\r\na weary mile over rugged highlands and through tangled forests,\r\nwithout finding themselves any nearer their journey's end. Now and\r\nthen, coming to some muddy, swollen stream, in order to gain the\r\nopposite side without getting their baggage wet, they must needs cross\r\nover on rafts rudely constructed of logs and grape-vines, and make\r\ntheir horses swim along behind them. It was near the middle of\r\nDecember, before the little party, jaded and travel-stained, reached\r\ntheir destination.\r\n\r\nMajor Washington was received with true soldierly courtesy by the\r\nFrench general, to whom he at once delivered Gov. Dinwiddie's letter.\r\nA few days being requested for a due consideration of its contents, as\r\nwell as the answer to be returned, he spent the time, as he had been\r\ninstructed, in gaining all the information he could, without exciting\r\nsuspicion, touching the designs of the French in the North-west,--to\r\nwhat extent they had won over the several Indian tribes to their\r\ninterest; the number of troops they had brought into the territory;\r\nand the number, strength, and situation of the forts they had built.\r\nThe fort where the French general then had his headquarters stood on\r\nthe banks of a little river called French Creek, in which Washington\r\nobserved lying, and bade his men count, a large number of canoes, to\r\nbe used early in the following spring for transporting men and\r\nmilitary stores down the Ohio. All the hints and items thus gathered\r\nhe carefully noted down in his journal, to be laid, as I have told you\r\nalready, in the form of a report, before Gov. Dinwiddie, upon his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nBeing wary and watchful, he was not long in discovering that the\r\nFrench were tampering with his Indian allies; tempting them, by the\r\ngayest of presents, the fairest of promises, and the hottest of\r\nfirewater, to break faith with the English, and join their cause.\r\nThese underhand dealings gave Washington much uneasiness of mind; and\r\nhe complained to the French general, yet in a firm and dignified\r\nmanner, of the unfair advantage thus taken of the besetting weakness\r\nof these poor people.\r\n\r\nOf course, the wily old Frenchman denied all knowledge of the matter;\r\nalthough we are bound to believe, that, as these tricks and intrigues\r\nwere going on under his very nose, he must certainly have winked at,\r\nif he did not openly encourage them.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Indians were by no means too nice to enrich\r\nthemselves with French presents, and get drunk on French whiskey; yet,\r\nfor all that, they turned a deaf ear to French promises, and, keeping\r\ntheir faith unbroken, remained as true as hickory to their friends the\r\nEnglish. Even the Half King, stately and commanding as he was in\r\ncouncil, yielded to the pleasing temptation along with the rest; and,\r\nfor the greater part of the time, lay beastly drunk about the fort.\r\nWhen at last he came to his sober senses, he was not a little\r\nchopfallen upon being somewhat sternly reminded by Major Washington of\r\nthe business that had brought him thither, the recollection of which\r\nhe had seemingly drowned in his enemy's whiskey. Whereupon, as if to\r\nshow that all his threats and promises had been made in good faith, he\r\nwent forthwith to the French general, and delivered the grave oration\r\nhe had composed for the occasion; at the same time returning the\r\nspeech-belt White Thunder had brought, as a sign that all friendly\r\nrelations between the French and his people were at an end.\r\n\r\nAt last, having received the answer to Gov. Dinwiddie's letter, and\r\nlooked into matters and things about him as far as he could with\r\nprudence, Major Washington was now anxious to be away from the place\r\nwhere he had already been detained too long. During his stay, however,\r\nhe had been treated with the greatest respect and courtesy by the\r\naccomplished Frenchman, who presented him, upon his departure, with a\r\nlarge canoe laden with a liberal supply of liquors and provisions,\r\nthat lasted him and his men until they reached the Ohio.\r\n\r\nTo spare the horses as much as possible, Washington had sent them,\r\nwith two or three of the men, by land to Venango, a fort about fifteen\r\nmiles below; whither he now set out to follow them by water. The\r\nnavigation of this little river, owing to its shallows and the masses\r\nof floating ice that here and there blocked up its channel, was\r\ndifficult and toilsome in the extreme. Oftentimes, to prevent their\r\nfrail canoes from being dashed to pieces against the rocks, would they\r\nbe compelled to get out into the cold water for half an hour at a\r\ntime, and guide them with their hands down the whirling and rapid\r\ncurrent, and now and then even to carry them and their loads by land\r\naround some foaming cataract to the smoother water below. After an\r\nirksome little voyage, they reached Venango, fully satisfied that to\r\ngo further by water was quite out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, at Venango, Major Washington, much to his regret, was compelled\r\nto part company with the Half King and his other red allies. White\r\nThunder, keeper of the speech-belt, had been so seriously injured in\r\ntheir passage down, as to be, for the present, quite unable to travel;\r\nand the rest would not think of leaving him, but needs must tarry\r\nthere until their friend should be well enough to be brought in a\r\ncanoe down the Alleghany.\r\n\r\nRemounting their horses, our little party once more took their weary\r\nway through the wilderness. It was now the 22d of December. The\r\nweather was bitter cold; the snow fell thick and fast, and froze as it\r\nfell; and the bleak winds moaned drearily among the naked trees. The\r\nforest streams were frozen from bank to bank, yet often too thin to\r\nbear the weight of the horses; which rendered their crossing painful\r\nand hazardous indeed. To add to the discomfort of our travellers, the\r\nhorses, from poor and scanty fare, had become too weak to be able\r\nlonger to carry their allotted burdens. Moved with compassion at their\r\npitiable plight, Washington dismounted from his fine saddle-horse, and\r\nloaded his with a part of the baggage; choosing rather to toil along\r\non foot, than to take his ease at the expense of pain even to these\r\npoor brutes. His humane example was promptly followed by the rest of\r\nthe party; and only the two men kept the saddle to whom was intrusted\r\nthe care of the baggage.\r\n\r\nYou can well imagine, that a Christmas spent in this wild waste of\r\nleafless woods and snowy hills was any thing but a merry one to these\r\npoor fellows, so far away from their homes, which, at that moment,\r\nthey knew to be so bright and cheerful with the mirth and laughter of\r\n\"old men and babes, and loving friends, and youths, and maidens gay.\"\r\nAnd yet I dare say, that, even there, they greeted each other on that\r\nblessed morning with a brighter smile than usual, and called to their\r\nremembrance, that on that morn a babe was born, who, in the fulness of\r\nyears, has grown to be the light and love and glory of the earth.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the half-famished beasts were growing weaker and weaker\r\nday by day, and that he would be too long in reaching his journey's\r\nend if he governed his speed by theirs, Washington left Capt. Van\r\nBraam in command of the party, and pushed forward with no other\r\ncompany than Mr. Gist. Armed with their trusty rifles, and clad in\r\nthe light dress of the Indians, with no extra covering for the night\r\nbut their watch-coats, and with no other baggage but a small\r\nportmanteau containing their food and Major Washington's important\r\npapers, they now made rapid headway, and soon left their friends far\r\nbehind. The next day, they came upon an Indian village called\r\nMurdering Town; a name of evil omen, given it, perhaps, from its\r\nhaving been the scene of some bloody Indian massacre. What befell them\r\nhere, I will tell you, as nearly as I can remember, in Mr. Gist's own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"We rose early in the morning, and set out at seven o'clock,\r\n     and got to Murdering Town, on the south-east fork of Beaver\r\n     Creek. Here we met with an Indian whom I thought I had seen at\r\n     Joncaire's, at Venango, when on our journey up to the French\r\n     fort. This fellow called me by my Indian name, and pretended to\r\n     be glad to see me. He asked us several questions; as, how we\r\n     came to travel on foot, when we left Venango, where we parted\r\n     with our horses, and when they would be there. Major Washington\r\n     insisted on travelling by the nearest way to the forks of the\r\n     Alleghany. We asked the Indian if he could go with us, and show\r\n     us the nearest way. The Indian seemed very glad and ready to go\r\n     with us; upon which we set out, and the Indian took the Major's\r\n     pack. We travelled very brisk for eight or ten miles; when the\r\n     Major's feet grew sore, and he very weary, and the Indian\r\n     steered too much north-eastwardly. The Major desired to encamp;\r\n     upon which the Indian asked to carry his gun, but he refused;\r\n     and then the Indian grew churlish, and pressed us to keep on,\r\n     telling us there were Ottawa Indians in those woods, and they\r\n     would scalp us if we lay out; but go to his cabin, and we would\r\n     be safe.\r\n\r\n     \"I thought very ill of the fellow, but did not care to let the\r\n     Major know I mistrusted him. But he soon mistrusted him as much\r\n     as I did. The Indian said he could hear a gun from his cabin,\r\n     and steered us northwardly. We grew uneasy, and then he said\r\n     two whoops might be heard from his cabin. We went two miles\r\n     further. Then the Major said he would stay at the next water,\r\n     and we desired the Indian to stop at the next water; but,\r\n     before we came to the water, we came to a clear meadow. It was\r\n     very light, and snow was on the ground. The Indian made a stop,\r\n     and turned about. The Major saw him point his gun towards us,\r\n     and he fired. Said the Major,--\r\n\r\n     \"'Are you shot?'\r\n\r\n     \"'No,' said I.\r\n\r\n     \"Upon which the Indian ran forward to a big standing white oak,\r\n     and began loading his gun; but we were soon with him. I would\r\n     have killed him; but the Major would not suffer me. We let him\r\n     charge his gun. We found he put in a ball: then we took care of\r\n     him. Either the Major or I always stood by the guns. We made\r\n     him make a fire for us by a little run, as if we intended to\r\n     sleep there. I said to the Major,--\r\n\r\n     \"'As you will not have him killed, we must get him away, and\r\n     then we must travel all night.'\r\n\r\n     \"Upon which I said to the Indian,--\r\n\r\n     \"'I suppose you were lost, and fired your gun?'\r\n\r\n     \"He said he knew the way to his cabin: it was but a little\r\n     distance.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well,' said I, 'do you go home, and, as we are tired, we will\r\n     follow your track in the morning; and here is a cake of bread\r\n     for you, and you must give us meat in the morning.'\r\n\r\n     \"He was glad to get away. I followed him, and listened until he\r\n     was fairly out of the way; and then we went about half a mile,\r\n     when we made a fire, set our compass, fixed our course, and\r\n     travelled all night. In the morning, we were on the head of\r\n     Piny Creek.\"\r\n\r\nThus you see, my dear children, from this adventure, upon what slight\r\naccidents sometimes hang the destinies, not only of individuals, but\r\neven of great nations; for had not this treacherous Indian missed his\r\naim, and that too, in all likelihood, for the first time in a\r\ntwelvemonth, it had never been our blessed privilege to know and love\r\nand reverence such a man as Washington; and that, instead of being the\r\nfree-born, independent people that he made us, we might have been at\r\nthis very moment throwing up our hats and wasting our precious breath\r\nin shouts of \"Long life to Queen Victoria!\"\r\n\r\nAll that day they walked on, weary and foot-sore, through the deep\r\nsnow, without a trace of living man to enliven their solitary way. The\r\ncold gray of a winter's evening was deepening the shadows of the\r\nforest when they came to the banks of the Alleghany; and here a new\r\ndisappointment awaited them. They had all along cheered themselves\r\nwith the prospect of crossing this river on the ice: but they found\r\nit frozen for about fifty yards only from either bank; while the rest\r\nof the ice, broken into huge cakes, went floating swiftly down the\r\nmain channel, crushing and grinding together, and filling the hollow\r\nwoods around with doleful noises.\r\n\r\nWith heavy hearts they kindled their camp-fire, and cooked and ate\r\ntheir frugal supper; then, making themselves as comfortable as the\r\npiercing winds would allow, they lay down on their snowy beds to\r\nsleep, hopeful that the morrow would bring them better luck. Morning\r\ndawned, and yet brought with it no brighter prospect. Would you know\r\nwhat they did in this grievous state? Listen while I read Major\r\nWashington's own account of it, as we find it written in his\r\njournal:--\r\n\r\n     \"There was no way for getting over but on a raft; which we set\r\n     about, with but one poor hatchet, and finished just after\r\n     sun-setting. This was a whole day's work. We next got it\r\n     launched; then went on board of it, and set off. But, before we\r\n     were half way over, we were jammed in the ice, in such a manner\r\n     that we expected every moment our raft to sink, and ourselves\r\n     to perish. I put out my setting-pole to try and stop the raft,\r\n     that the ice might pass by; when the rapidity of the stream\r\n     threw it with so much violence against the pole, that it jerked\r\n     me out into ten feet of water: but I fortunately saved myself\r\n     by catching hold of one of the raft-logs. Notwithstanding all\r\n     our efforts, we could not get to either shore, but were\r\n     obliged, as we were near an island, to quit our raft, and make\r\n     to it. The cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist had all\r\n     his fingers, and some of his toes, frozen; and the water was\r\n     shut up so hard, that we found no difficulty in getting off the\r\n     island, on the ice, in the morning, and went to Mr. Frazier's.\"\r\n\r\nHere, for a space, they stopped to rest and refresh themselves after\r\nthe fatigue and exposure they had just undergone; and here, among\r\nother items of interest, they heard that Queen Aliquippa, an Indian\r\nprincess, had been deeply offended that the young Long Knife had\r\npassed by her royal shanty, the month before, without calling to pay\r\nhis compliments. Major Washington, well knowing that to humor their\r\npeculiar whims and fancies was the best mode of securing the good-will\r\nand friendship of these people, hastened at once to present himself\r\nbefore her copper majesty, and make what amends he could for his\r\nbreach of etiquette. The present of a bottle of rum (over which, queen\r\nthat she was, she smacked her lips), and of his old watch-coat, that\r\nwould so handsomely set off her buckskin leggins, softened her ire\r\ncompletely, and made her, from that time forward, the stanch friend\r\nand ally of the English.\r\n\r\nTravelling on a few miles further, they came to Mr. Gist's house, on\r\nthe banks of the Monongahela, where Washington bought a horse to bear\r\nhim to his journey's end, and parted with his trusty guide. He was now\r\nentirely alone; and a wide stretch of woods and mountains, swamps and\r\nfrozen streams, still lay between him and the cheerful homes to whose\r\ncomforts he had been so long a stranger. Now and then, the loneliness\r\nof the way would be for a moment enlivened by the sight of some sturdy\r\nbackwoodsman, axe or rifle on shoulder, pushing westward, with his\r\nwife and children and dogs and household trumpery, to find a home in\r\nsome still more distant part of the wilderness. It was midwinter,\r\nwhen, after having been absent eleven weeks on his perilous mission,\r\nour young Virginian, looking more like a wild Indian than the civil\r\nand Christian gentleman that he really was, rode into the town of\r\nWilliamsburg, nor halted until he had alighted and hitched his horse\r\nin front of the governor's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON'S FIRST BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival, Major Washington hastened at once to lay before Gov.\r\nDinwiddie, and the Virginia Legislature then in session, the French\r\ngeneral's letter, and the journal he had kept during the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, the French general spoke in high and flattering terms\r\nof the character and talents of young Washington; but, in language\r\nmost decided and unmistakable, refused to withdraw his troops from the\r\ndisputed territory, or cease building forts therein, as had been\r\ndemanded of him, unless so ordered by his royal master, the King of\r\nFrance, to whose wishes only he owed respect and obedience. From the\r\ntenor of this letter, it was plainly enough to be seen (what might, in\r\nfact, have been seen before), that the French were not in the least\r\ninclined to give up, at the mere asking, all that they had been at so\r\nmuch pains and expense at gaining. It therefore followed, that as the\r\ntitle to this bit of forest land could not be written with the pen, on\r\nfair paper, in letters of Christian ink, it must needs be written with\r\nthe sword, on the fair earth, in letters of Christian blood. By this,\r\nthe little folks are to understand their Uncle Juvinell to mean that\r\nwar alone could settle the question between them. And this\r\nunreasonable behavior, on the part of two great nations, has already,\r\nI doubt not, brought to your minds the story of two huge giants, who,\r\nchancing to meet one night, fell into a long and stormy dispute with\r\neach other about the possession of a fair bit of meadow-land they had\r\nhappened to spy out at the same moment, where it lay in the lower horn\r\nof the moon; and who finally, like the silly monsters that they were,\r\nbegan belaboring each other with their heavy malls, as if the last\r\nhope of beating a little reason in were to beat a few brains out.\r\n\r\nTo drive and keep back the French and their Indian allies, Gov.\r\nDinwiddie made a call on the Virginia militia, and wrote to the\r\ngovernors of some of the neighboring provinces, urging them, for their\r\ncommon defence, to do the same. To strengthen their borders, and give\r\nsecurity to their frontier settlers, a small party of pioneers and\r\ncarpenters were sent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio, as\r\nWashington had recommended in his journal. This journal, by the way,\r\nthrowing, as it did, so much new light on the designs of the French in\r\nAmerica, was thought worthy of publication, not only throughout the\r\nColonies, but also in the mother-country. The good sense, skill,\r\naddress, and courage shown by the young Virginian throughout the late\r\nexpedition, had drawn upon him the eyes of his countrymen; and, from\r\nthat time forward, he became the hope and promise of his native land.\r\nAs a proof of this high regard, he was offered the command of the\r\nregiment to be raised: which, however, he refused to accept; for his\r\nmodesty told him that he was too young and inexperienced to be\r\nintrusted with a matter of such moment to his country. To Col. Fry, an\r\nofficer of some note in the province, the command of the regiment was\r\ntherefore given; under whom he was quite willing to accept the post of\r\nlieutenant-colonel.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the pressing danger that threatened all alike, the\r\npeople were shamefully slow in answering the summons to arms.\r\nWashington had felt confident, that, at the very first tap of the\r\ndrum, squads upon squads of active, sturdy, well-fed, well-clothed\r\nyoung farmers, moved by the same spirit with himself, would come\r\nflocking to his standard with their trusty rifles, powder-horns, and\r\nhunting-pouches, ready and eager to do their country service. Instead\r\nof this, however, there gathered, about him a rabble of ragamuffins\r\nand worthless fellows, who had spent their lives in tramping up and\r\ndown the country, without settled homes or occupations.\r\n\r\nSome were without hats and shoes; some had coats, and no shirts; some\r\nhad shirts, and no coats; and all were without arms, or any keen\r\ndesire to use them if they had them. All this disgusted and\r\ndisheartened our youthful colonel not a little; for he was young, and\r\nhad yet to learn that it is of just such stuff that the beginnings of\r\narmies are always made. The slender pay of a soldier was not enough to\r\ntempt the thriving yeomanry to leave their rich acres and snug\r\nfiresides to undergo the hardships and dangers of a camp life; as if,\r\nby failing to answer their country's call, and fighting in its\r\ndefence, they were not running a still greater risk of losing all they\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the young men of the province to come forward, Gov.\r\nDinwiddie caused it to be proclaimed, that two hundred thousand acres\r\nof the very best land on the head-waters of the Ohio should be divided\r\nbetween those that should enlist and serve during the war. This\r\nsplendid offer had, in some small measure, the effect desired; so\r\nthat, in a short time, something like an army was cobbled together,\r\nwith which, poor and scantily provided as it was, they at last\r\nresolved to take the field.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington, in command of the main body, was ordered to go on in\r\nadvance, and cut a military road through the wilderness, in the\r\ndirection of the new fort at the Forks of the Ohio, by way of the\r\nMonongahela; while Col. Fry was to remain behind with the rest of the\r\ntroops, to bring up the cannon and heavy stores when the road should\r\nbe opened. When the pioneers had cut their way about twenty miles\r\nbeyond the frontier town of Winchester, there came a rumor, that the\r\nmen who had been sent to build the fort at the Forks of the Ohio had\r\nall been surprised and captured by the French. In a few days, all\r\ndoubts as to the truth of this report were set at rest by the men\r\nthemselves, who came walking leisurely into camp, with their spades\r\nand axes on their shoulders, to every appearance quite well and\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nFor several days, they said, they had been working away on the fort\r\nquite merrily; when, early one morning, they were much surprised to\r\nsee one thousand Frenchmen, in sixty bateaux, or boats, and three\r\nhundred canoes, with six pieces of cannon, dropping quietly down the\r\nAlleghany. The leader of this gallant little force summoned the fort\r\nto surrender in the short space of an hour, or else they would find\r\ntheir unfinished timber-work tumbling about their heads in a way that\r\nwould not be altogether agreeable. No one with even half his wits\r\nabout him would have for a moment thought of defending an unfinished\r\nfort with axes, spades, and augers, against a force of twenty times\r\ntheir number, backed by cannon and grape-shot. These men had all their\r\nwits about them, and, to prove it, gave up the fort without further\r\nparley; when the French captain marched in, and took formal possession\r\nof the wooden pen in the name of his most Christian majesty, the King\r\nof France; after which, with that gayety and good-humor so often to\r\nbe observed among the French people, he invited the young ensign--who,\r\nin the absence of the captain, had been left in the command of the\r\nfort for that day--to dine and drink a glass of wine with him. He then\r\nsuffered them all to depart in peace with his good wishes, and with\r\ntheir spades, carpenter's tools, and axes on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington was deeply mortified at this intelligence; but, like\r\nthe manly man that he was, he put a bright face on the matter, and, to\r\nkeep up the spirits of his men, resolved to push on with the road with\r\nmore vigor than ever. And a tremendous undertaking this was, I assure\r\nyou. The tallest of trees were to be felled, the hugest of rocks to be\r\nsplit and removed, the deepest of swamps to be filled, and the\r\nswiftest of mountain torrents bridged over. With such hinderances, you\r\nwill not wonder that they made but four miles a day. Now and then, the\r\nsoldiers would be obliged to put their shoulders to the wheel, and\r\nhelp the poor half-famished horses with their heavy wagons up some\r\nrough and rocky steep. Thus over the gloomy mountains, and down the\r\nrugged defiles, and through a dark and lonely valley since called the\r\nShades of Death, they forced their toilsome way. At last, after many\r\nweary days, they reached the banks of the Youghiogeny,--a romantic\r\nlittle river that went tumbling down the green hills in many a foaming\r\nwaterfall; then, like a frolicsome school-boy nearing school, put on\r\na demure and sober face, and quietly emptied itself into the more\r\ntranquil Monongahela. Here, to give his worn-out men and horses some\r\nrepose after their severe and unceasing labors, Washington ordered a\r\nhalt.\r\n\r\nBeing told by some friendly Indians that the baggage could be carried\r\ndown this stream by water, he set out early one morning in a canoe,\r\nwith four or five white men, and an Indian for a guide, to see for\r\nhimself what truth there might be in this report. When they had rowed\r\nabout ten miles, their Indian guide, after sulking for a little while,\r\nlaid his oar across the canoe, and refused to go further. At first,\r\nthis behavior appeared to them a little queer; but they were not long\r\nin discovering that it was only a way the cunning red rascal had of\r\nhiggling to get more pay for his services. After some pretty sharp\r\nbargaining, Col. Washington promised to give him his old watch-coat\r\nand a ruffled shirt if he would go on; upon which, without more ado,\r\nhe picked up his oar, and for the rest of the trip steered away\r\nblithely enough. You can well imagine what an uncommon swell this\r\nsavage dandy, with his bare red legs, must have cut, a few days after,\r\nin his civilized finery, among the copper-cheeked belles of the woods.\r\nBy the time they had rowed twenty miles further, Washington was\r\nsatisfied, that, owing to the rocks and rapids, a passage down this\r\nriver in the shallow canoes of the Indians was next to impossible.\r\n\r\nReturning to camp, he soon afterwards received word from his old\r\nfriend and ally, the Half King, that a party of French had been seen\r\ncoming from the direction of Fort Duquesne, who were in all\r\nlikelihood, by that time, somewhere in his close neighborhood. Upon\r\nhearing this, Washington deemed it prudent to fall back a few miles to\r\nthe Great Meadows, a beautiful little plain, situated in the midst of\r\nwoods and hills, and divided by a rivulet. Here he threw up strong\r\nintrenchments, cleared away the undergrowth, and prepared what he\r\ncalled \"a charming field for an encounter.\" Shortly after, Mr. Gist,\r\nwhom you well remember, came into camp, from his home on the\r\nMonongahela, with the tidings, that a party of French had been at his\r\nhouse on the day before, whom, from their appearance, he believed to\r\nbe spies. Washington sent out some of his men on wagon-horses to beat\r\nthe woods; who came in about dusk, without having, however, discovered\r\nany traces of the enemy. About nine o'clock that same night, an Indian\r\nrunner came from the Half King with word, that some of his hunters had\r\nlate that evening seen the tracks of two Frenchmen not five miles\r\ndistant; and that, if Col. Washington would join him with some of his\r\nmen, they would set out early in the morning in quest of the lurking\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nTaking with him about forty men, and leaving the rest to guard the\r\nintrenchments, Washington set out forthwith for the Indian camp. Their\r\nway led them through tall and thick woods, that were then in the full\r\nleaf of early summer. As if to deepen their gloom, the sky was\r\novercast with the blackest of clouds, from which the rain poured down\r\nin torrents; and the night, of course, was as dark as dark could be.\r\nNo wonder, then, that they were continually losing their path, which\r\nwas but a deer-track, and none of the plainest, even in broad\r\ndaylight. When any one discovered that he had lost himself, he would\r\nshout, and set himself right again by the answering shouts of his\r\ncomrades who might be so lucky as to be in the path at that moment.\r\nAfter blundering about all night through marshy thickets, slipping\r\nupon slimy rocks, and scrambling over the oozy trunks of fallen trees,\r\nthey reached the Indian camp at daybreak in a somewhat moist and\r\nbedabbled plight, as you may well imagine. The Half King seemed\r\noverjoyed at seeing his young white brother once more; and, with true\r\nIndian hospitality, set before him and his men the best his camp\r\nafforded. After breakfasting heartily on bear's meat, venison, and\r\nparched corn, they all set out together, much refreshed, to seek what\r\ngame might be in the wind. The Half King led the way to the spot where\r\nthe two tracks had been seen the evening before; and, having found\r\nthem, told two of his sharp-eyed hunters to follow the trail until\r\nthey could bring some tidings of the feet that had made them. Like\r\nhounds on the scent of a fox, they started off at a long trot; only\r\npausing now and then to look more closely at the leaves, to make sure\r\nthey were right, and not on a cold scent. In a short time, they came\r\nback with word that they had spied twenty-five or thirty French and\r\nCanadians encamped in a low, narrow bottom, between high and steep\r\nhills, who looked as if they were desirous of concealment. Whereupon\r\nWashington proposed that the two parties should divide, and, stealing\r\nupon the enemy from opposite directions, surprise and capture him, if\r\npossible, without the shedding of blood. To this the Half King agreed;\r\nand, parting, they moved off in profound silence, each on their\r\nseparate way.\r\n\r\nA sudden turn of the hollow, down which they had been making their way\r\nfor several minutes, brought Washington and his party, ere they were\r\nwell aware, in full view of the enemy. Some were cooking their\r\nmorning's meal, some were preparing their arms for the day's\r\nexcursion, some were lounging, and all were merry. But, seeing as soon\r\nas seen, they ran with all speed to their guns, that were leaned\r\nagainst the trees hard by, and, without more ado, began firing in so\r\nbrisk and earnest a manner, that left the Virginians no choice but to\r\nreturn it, which they did with spirit. About the same time, the Half\r\nKing and his warriors came down to the bottom of the hill on the\r\nopposite side of the hollow, and, screening themselves behind a bit of\r\nrising ground, joined the music of their rifles with the rest. For\r\nabout fifteen minutes, the skirmish was kept up with great spirit on\r\nboth sides; when the French, having lost ten of their number (among\r\nwhom was their leader, Capt. de Jumonville), surrendered, and yielded\r\nup their arms. Washington had one man shot dead at his side, and three\r\nmen wounded; but his Indian allies, protected as they were by the\r\nrising ground, came off without the loss of a single feather or\r\nporcupine-quill. Unluckily, in the heat of the encounter, a\r\nswift-footed Canadian, better, no doubt, at dodging than shooting,\r\nmanaged to make his escape, and carried the news to Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nThe Half King and his warriors, I am sorry to tell you, would have\r\nbutchered the prisoners in cold blood, had not Washington sternly\r\nforbidden them. They therefore consoled themselves as best they might\r\nfor this disappointment by scalping the dead; which, however, yielded\r\nthem but sorry comfort, as there were but ten scalps to be divided\r\namong forty warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Half King was much offended by this humane interference, on the\r\npart of his young white brother, in behalf of the prisoners; for he\r\nseemed to think, that as they were spies, and French spies at that,\r\nthey richly deserved to be scalped alive. Such milk-and-water,\r\nhalf-way measures might do for pale-faces, but were not the sort of\r\nentertainment to be relished by a genuine Indian brave of the first\r\nwater, or, to speak more to the point, of the first blood.\r\n\r\nWithout, however, in the least heeding these muttered grumblings of\r\nthe worthy old chief, who had his failings along with the rest of\r\nmankind, Col. Washington took the prisoners to his camp, where he\r\ntreated them with even more kindness and courtesy than they as spies\r\ndeserved. From thence he sent them under a strong guard to\r\nWilliamsburg, and wrote to Gov. Dinwiddie, begging him to treat them\r\nwith all the humanity due to prisoners of war, but to keep a strict\r\nwatch over them, as there were among them two or three very cunning\r\nand dangerous men.\r\n\r\nThis encounter, commonly called the Jumonville affair, caused a great\r\nsensation, not only throughout the Colonies, but also in France and\r\nEngland; for it was there, as you must know, in that remote and\r\nobscure little valley, that flowed the first blood of this long and\r\neventful war. It was Washington's first battle; and, being a\r\nsuccessful one, much inspirited him. In a letter written at this time\r\nto his brother Augustine, after touching upon the particulars of this\r\nskirmish, he says, \"I heard the bullets whistle; and, believe me,\r\nthere is something charming in the sound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nFORT NECESSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Col. Fry died at Wills's Creek, where he had lain ill\r\nof a fever for several weeks; and Washington, as the next in rank, was\r\nobliged to take command of the regiment. Although this change brought\r\nwith it an increase of pay and honors, yet it caused him the sincerest\r\nregret; for even then, young as he was, he had the good of his country\r\nmore earnestly at heart than his own private advantage. He said, and\r\nwith unfeigned modesty, that he feared he was scarcely equal to the\r\ndischarge of such high and responsible duties, without the aid and\r\ncounsel of some older and more experienced officer.\r\n\r\nCapt. de Villiers was now commander of the French at Fort Duquesne.\r\nWhen tidings of the late encounter reached this officer through the\r\nswift-footed Canadian, he swore a deep oath that he would chastise the\r\naudacious young Virginian for what he chose to call this barbarous\r\noutrage, and avenge the death of De Jumonville, whose brother-in-law,\r\nas ill luck would have it, he chanced to be. Foreseeing his danger,\r\nand to defend himself against the superior force he knew would be\r\nbrought against him, Col. Washington set about forthwith to strengthen\r\nhis works. He dug the ditches deeper, raised the breastworks higher,\r\nand surrounded the whole with a row of palisades, firmly planted in\r\nthe ground, and set so close together as scarcely to allow of a\r\ngun-barrel passing between them.\r\n\r\nOwing to the shameful neglect of those whose duty it was to send up\r\nsupplies, he and his men suffered much from the want of food,--many\r\ndays at a stretch sometimes passing by without their tasting bread. To\r\naggravate this new distress, the Half King and many of his warriors,\r\nwith their wives and children, now sought refuge in the fort from the\r\nvengeance of the French and their savage allies; which added nothing\r\nto their strength, and only increased the number of hungry mouths to\r\nbe fed. To this place, then, where gaunt famine pinched them from\r\nwithin and watchful enemies beset them from without, Washington gave\r\nthe fitting name of Fort Necessity. Luckily for them, while in this\r\npitiable plight, days and days passed by, and still no avenging De\r\nVilliers showed himself, though alarms were frequent.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington now ordered Major Muse to bring up the rest of the\r\ntroops that had been waiting all this while at Wills's Creek, with the\r\nheavy stores and cannon. To reward the friendly Indians for their\r\nservices and fidelity, Major Muse brought with him presents of\r\nhatchets and knives, guns, powder and lead, tin cups, needles and\r\npins, beads, and dry-goods of every gaudy hue, and it may be, although\r\nwe can only guess it, a ruffled shirt or two. In addition to these,\r\nthere came a number of silver medals for the chief sachems, sent by\r\nGov. Dinwiddie at the suggestion of Col. Washington, who well knew how\r\nmuch these simple people prize little compliments of this kind. Major\r\nMuse handed out the presents, while Washington hung the medals about\r\nthe necks of the sachems, which yielded them far more delight, you\r\nwill be sorry to hear, than their good old missionary's catechism.\r\nThis was done with all that show and parade so dear to an Indian's\r\nheart; and, to give a still finer edge to the present occasion, they\r\nchristened each other all over again: that is to say, the red men gave\r\nthe white men Indian names, and the white men gave the red men English\r\nnames. Thus, for example, Washington gave the Half King the name of\r\nDinwiddie, which pleased him greatly; while he, in his turn, bestowed\r\non his young white brother a long, high-sounding Indian name, that you\r\ncould pronounce as readily spelt backwards as forwards. Fairfax was\r\nthe name given a young sachem, the son of Queen Aliquippa, whose\r\neternal friendship to the English, it must be borne in mind, had been\r\nsecured by Washington, the previous winter, by the present of an old\r\ncoat and a bottle of rum.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of his old and much-esteemed friend, Col. William\r\nFairfax, Washington had divine worship in the fort daily, in which he\r\nled; and, thanks to the early teachings of his pious mother, he could\r\ndo this, and sin not. Solemn indeed, my dear children, and beautiful\r\nto behold, must have been that picture,--that little fort, so far away\r\nin the heart of the lonely wilderness, with its motley throng of\r\npainted Indians and leather-clad backwoodsmen gathered round their\r\nyoung commander, as, morning and evening, he kneeled in prayer before\r\nthe Giver of all good, beseeching aid and protection, and giving\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nAs if to put his manhood and patience to a still severer test, there\r\ncame to the fort about this time an independent company of one hundred\r\nNorth Carolinians, headed by one Capt. Mackay, who refused to serve\r\nunder him as his superior officer. As his reason for this conduct,\r\nMackay argued that he held a royal commission (that is to say, had\r\nbeen made a captain by the King of England), which made him equal in\r\nrank, if not superior, to Washington, who held only a provincial\r\ncommission, or had been made a colonel by the Governor of Virginia.\r\nThis, in part, was but too true; and it had been a source of\r\ndissatisfaction to Washington, that the rank and services of colonial\r\nofficers should be held at a cheaper rate than the same were valued at\r\nin the royal army. It wounded his honest, manly pride, and offended\r\nhis high sense of justice; and he had already resolved in his own mind\r\nto quit such inglorious service, as soon as he could do so without\r\ninjury to the present campaign, or loss of honor to himself. To most\r\nmen, the lofty airs and pretensions of Capt. Mackay and his\r\nIndependents would have been unbearable; but he kept his temper\r\nunruffled, and, with a prudence beyond his years, forbore to do or say\r\nany thing that would lead to an angry outbreak between them; and as\r\nthey chose to encamp outside the fort, and have separate guards, he\r\ndeemed it wisest not to trouble himself about them, only so far as\r\nmight concern their common safety.\r\n\r\nDays, and even weeks, had now passed away, and still no enemy had come\r\nto offer him battle. His men were becoming restless from inaction; and\r\nthe example of the troublesome Independents had already begun to stir\r\nup discontent among them, which threatened, if not checked in season,\r\nto end in downright insubordination. As the surest remedy for these\r\nevils, Washington resolved to push forward with the road in the\r\ndirection of Fort Duquesne, and carry the war into the enemy's own\r\ncountry. Requesting Capt. Mackay to guard the fort during his absence,\r\nhe set out with his entire force of three hundred men, and again began\r\nthe toilsome work of cutting a road through the wilderness. The\r\ndifficulties they had now to overcome were even greater than those\r\nwhich beset them at the outset of their pioneering. The mountains\r\nwere higher, the swamps deeper, the rocks more massive, the trees\r\ntaller and more numerous, the torrents more rapid, the days more hot\r\nand sultry, and the men and horses more enfeebled by poor and scanty\r\nfood. You will not wonder, then, that they were nearly two weeks in\r\nreaching Mr. Gist's plantation on the Monongahela, a distance of but\r\nfifteen miles.\r\n\r\nBut hardly had they pitched their tents, and thrown themselves on the\r\ngrass to snatch a little rest, when there came the disheartening\r\nintelligence, brought in by their Indian spies, that Capt. de Villiers\r\nhad been seen to sally from Fort Duquesne but a few hours before, at\r\nthe head of a force of five hundred French and four hundred Indians,\r\nand must by that time be within a few miles of the Virginia camp. For\r\nthree hundred weary and hungry men to wait and give battle to a force\r\nthree times their number, fresh and well fed, was a thing too absurd\r\nto be thought of for a single moment. Washington, therefore, as their\r\nonly chance of safety, ordered a hasty retreat, hoping that they might\r\nbe able to reach the settlements on Wills's Creek before the enemy\r\ncould overtake him. The retreat, however, was any thing but a hasty\r\none; for the poor half-famished horses were at last no longer able to\r\ndrag the heavy cannon and carry the heavy baggage. Moved with pity for\r\nthe lean and tottering beasts, Washington dismounted from his fine\r\ncharger, and gave him for a pack-horse; which humane example was\r\npromptly followed by his officers. Yet even this was not enough: so,\r\nwhile some of the jaded men loaded their backs with the baggage, the\r\nrest, as jaded, dragged the artillery along the stony roads with\r\nropes, rather than that it should be left behind to fall into the\r\nhands of the enemy. For this good service, rendered so willingly in\r\nthat hour of sore distress, they went not unrewarded by their generous\r\nyoung commander.\r\n\r\nCapt. Mackay and his company of Independents had, at Washington's\r\nrequest, come up a little while before, and now joined in the retreat.\r\nBut they joined in nothing else; for, pluming themselves upon their\r\ngreater respectability as soldiers of his Britannic majesty, they lent\r\nnot a helping hand in this hour of pressing need, although the danger\r\nthat lurked behind threatened all alike. They marched along, these\r\ncoxcombs, daintily picking their way over the smoothest roads, and too\r\ngenteel to be burdened with any thing but their clean muskets and tidy\r\nknapsacks. This ill-timed and insolent behavior served only to\r\naggravate the trials of the other poor fellows all the more; and when,\r\nat last, they had managed to drag the cannon and the wagons and\r\nthemselves to Fort Necessity, they were so overcome with fatigue and\r\nhunger, and so moved with indignation at the conduct of the\r\nIndependents, that they threw down their ropes and packs, and flatly\r\nrefused to be marched further. Seeing their pitiful plight, and that\r\nit would be impossible to reach the settlements, Col. Washington, as\r\ntheir last chance of safety, turned aside, and once more took shelter\r\nin his little fort.\r\n\r\nAs Capt. Mackay and his company of gentlemen fighters had done nothing\r\ntowards strengthening the works during his absence, Washington ordered\r\na few trees to be felled in the woods hard by, as a still further\r\nbarrier to the approach of the enemy. Just as the last tree went\r\ncrashing down, the French and their Indian allies, nine hundred\r\nstrong, came in sight, and opened a scattering fire upon the fort, but\r\nfrom so great a distance as made it little more than an idle waste of\r\npowder and lead. Suspecting this to be but a feint of the crafty foe\r\nto decoy them into an ambuscade, Washington ordered his men to keep\r\nwithin the shelter of the fort, there to lie close, and only to shoot\r\nwhen they could plainly see where their bullets were to be sent.\r\n\r\nA light skirmishing was kept up all day, and until a late hour in the\r\nnight; the Indians keeping the while within the shelter of the woods,\r\nwhich at no point came within sixty yards of the palisades. Whenever\r\nan Indian scalp-lock or a French cap showed itself from among the\r\ntrees or bushes, it that instant became the mark of a dozen\r\nsharpshooters watching at the rifle-holes of the fort. All that day,\r\nand all the night too, the rain poured down from one black cloud, as\r\nonly a summer ruin can pour, till the ditches were filled with water,\r\nand the breastworks nothing but a bank of miry clay; till the men were\r\ndrenched to the skin, and the guns of many so dampened as to be unfit\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock that night, the firing ceased; and shortly after a\r\nvoice was heard, a little distance beyond the palisades, calling upon\r\nthe garrison, in the name of Capt. de Villiers, to surrender.\r\nSuspecting this to be but a pretext for getting a spy into the fort,\r\nCol. Washington refused to admit the bearer of the summons. Capt. de\r\nVilliers then requested that an officer be sent to his quarters to\r\nparley; giving his word of honor that no mischief should befall him,\r\nor unfair advantage be taken of it. Whereupon, Capt. Van Braam, the\r\nold Dutch fencing-master, being the only French interpreter\r\nconveniently at hand, was employed to go and bring in the terms of\r\nsurrender. He soon came back; but the terms were too dishonorable for\r\nany true soldier to think of accepting. He was sent again, but with no\r\nbetter result. The third time, Capt. de Villiers sent written articles\r\nof capitulation; which, being in his own language, must needs be first\r\ntranslated before an answer could be returned. By the flickering light\r\nof one poor candle, which could hardly be kept burning for the pouring\r\nrain, the Dutch captain read the terms he had brought, while the rest\r\nstood round him, gathering what sense they could from the confused\r\njumbling of bad French, and worse English he was pleased to call a\r\ntranslation. After this, there followed a little more parleying\r\nbetween the hostile leaders; when it was at last settled that the\r\nprisoners taken in the Jumonville affair should be set at liberty;\r\nthat the English should build no forts upon the disputed territories\r\nwithin a twelvemonth to come; and that the garrison, after destroying\r\nthe artillery and military stores, should be allowed to march out with\r\nall the honors of war, and pursue their way to the settlements,\r\nunmolested either by the French or their Indian allies. When we take\r\ninto account the more than double strength of the enemy, the starving\r\ncondition of the garrison (still further weakened as it was by the\r\nloss of twelve men killed and forty-three wounded), and the slender\r\nhope of speedy succor from the settlements, these terms must be\r\nregarded as highly honorable to Col. Washington; and still more so\r\nwhen we add to this the fact, that the Half King and his other Indian\r\nallies had deserted him at the first approach of danger, under the\r\npretext of finding some safer retreat for their wives and children.\r\nWhether they failed from choice, or hinderance to return, and take\r\npart in the action, can never now be known with certainty.\r\n\r\nThus the dreary night wore away; and, when the dreary morning dawned,\r\nthey destroyed the artillery and the military stores, preparatory to\r\ntheir setting forth on their retreat. As all the horses had been\r\nkilled or lost the day before, they had no means of removing their\r\nheavy baggage: they therefore secured it as best they might, hoping to\r\nbe able to send back for it from the settlements. Still in possession\r\nof their small-arms, they then marched out of the fort with all the\r\nhonors of war,--fifes playing, drums beating, and colors flying. They\r\nhad gone but a few yards from the fort, when a large body of Indians\r\npounced with plundering hands upon the baggage. Seeing that the French\r\ncould not or would not keep them back, Washington, to disappoint them\r\nof their booty, ordered his men to set fire to it, and destroy all\r\nthey could not bring away upon their backs.\r\n\r\nThis done, they once more took up their line of march; and a\r\nmelancholy march it was. Between them and the nearest settlements,\r\nthere lay seventy miles of steep and rugged mountain-roads, over which\r\nthey must drag their weary and aching limbs before they could hope to\r\nfind a little rest. Washington did all that a kind and thoughtful\r\ncommander could to keep up the flagging spirits of his men; sharing\r\nwith them their every toil and privation, and all the while\r\nmaintaining a firm and cheerful demeanor. Reaching Wills's Creek, he\r\nthere left them to enjoy the full abundance which they found awaiting\r\nthem at that place; and, in company with Capt. Mackay, repaired at\r\nonce to Williamsburg to report the result of the campaign to Gov.\r\nDinwiddie.\r\n\r\nA short time after, the terms of surrender were laid before the\r\nVirginia House of Burgesses, and received the entire approval of that\r\nwise body; who, although the expedition had ended in defeat and\r\nfailure, most cheerfully gave Col. Washington and his men a vote of\r\nthanks, in testimony of their having done their whole duty as good and\r\nbrave and faithful soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BRADDOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving brought the campaign to an honorable if not successful end,\r\nCol. Washington threw up his commission, and left the service. This\r\nhad been his determination for some time past; and he felt that he\r\ncould do so now without laying his conduct open to censure or\r\nsuspicion, having within his own breast the happy assurance, that, in\r\nthe discharge of his late trust, he had acted the part of a faithful\r\nsoldier and true patriot, seeking only his country's good. The reasons\r\nthat led him to take this step need not be repeated, as you will\r\nreadily understand them, if you still bear in mind what I told you a\r\nshort time since touching those questions of rank which caused the\r\ndifficulty between him and Capt. Mackay.\r\n\r\nA visit to his much-beloved mother was the first use he made of his\r\nleisure. The profound love and reverence that never failed to mark his\r\nconduct towards his mother were among the most beautiful traits of his\r\ncharacter. The management of the family estate, and the education of\r\nthe younger children, were concerns in which he ever took the\r\nliveliest interest; and to make these labors light and easy to her by\r\nhis aid or counsel was a pleasure to him indeed. This grateful duty\r\nduly done, he once more sought the shelter of Mount Vernon, to whose\r\ncomforts he had been for so many months a stranger. The toils of a\r\nsoldier's life were now exchanged for the peaceful labors of a\r\nhusbandman. Nor did this change, to his well-ordered mind, bring with\r\nit any idle regrets; for the quiet pursuits of a farmer's life yielded\r\nhim, young, ardent, and adventurous as he was, scarcely less delight\r\nthan the profession of arms, and even more as he grew in years.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the Great Meadows roused the mother-country at last to a\r\nfull sense of the danger that threatened her possessions in America.\r\nAccordingly, to regain what had been lost, money, and munitions of\r\nwar, and a gallant little army fitted out in the completest style of\r\nthat day, were sent over with all possible expedition, under the\r\ncommand of Major-Gen. Braddock.\r\n\r\nFrom the shrubby heights of Mount Vernon, Washington could look down,\r\nand behold the British ships-of-war as they moved slowly up the\r\nmajestic Potomac, their decks thronged with officers and soldiers\r\ndressed in showy uniform, their polished arms and accoutrements\r\nflashing back the cold, clear light of the February sun. From their\r\nencampment at Alexandria, a few miles distant, he could hear the\r\nbooming of their morning and evening guns, as it came roiling over the\r\nhills and through the woods, and shook his quiet home like a sullen\r\nsummons to arms. Often, no longer able to keep down his youthful\r\nardor, he would mount his horse, and, galloping up to the town, spend\r\nhours there in watching the different companies, as with the precision\r\nof clockwork they went through their varied and difficult evolutions.\r\nAt these sights and sounds, all the martial spirit within him took\r\nfire again.\r\n\r\nTo Gen. Braddock, who commanded all the forces in America, provincial\r\nas well as royal, Gov. Dinwiddie and other Virginia notables spoke in\r\nthe highest terms of the character of young Washington; giving him at\r\nthe same time still further particulars of the brave and soldierly\r\nconduct he had so signally shown during the campaign of the previous\r\nyear. They took pleasure, they said, in recommending him as one whose\r\nskill and experience in Indian warfare, and thorough acquaintance with\r\nthe wild country beyond the borders, were such as could be turned to\r\nthe greatest advantage in the course of the following campaign.\r\n\r\nDesirous of securing services of such peculiar value, Braddock sent\r\nour young Virginian a courteous invitation to join his staff; offering\r\nhim the post of volunteer aide-de-camp, with the rank of colonel. Here\r\nwas an opportunity of gratifying his taste for arms under one of the\r\nfirst generals of the day. Could he do it without the sacrifice of\r\nhonor or self-respect? Although he had left the service for the best\r\nof reasons, as you must bear in mind, yet there was nothing in these\r\nreasons to hinder him from serving his country, not for pay, but as a\r\ngenerous volunteer, bearing his own expenses. Besides, such a post as\r\nthis would place him altogether above the authority of any equal or\r\ninferior officer who might chance to hold a king's commission.\r\nDebating thus with himself, and urged on by his friends, he accepted\r\nBraddock's invitation, and joined his staff as volunteer aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\nNow, would you know what an aide-de-camp is? Wait, and you will find\r\nout for yourselves when we come to the battle of the Monongahela,\r\nwhere Braddock suffered his gallant little army to be cut to pieces by\r\nthe French and Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Washington heard that her son was on the eve of joining the\r\nnew army, full of a mother's fears, she hastened to entreat him not\r\nagain to expose himself to the dangers and trials of a soldier's life.\r\nAlthough the army was the only opening to distinction at that time in\r\nthe Colonies, yet, to have him ever near her, she would rather have\r\nseen him quietly settled at his beautiful homestead, as an\r\nunpretending farmer, than on the high road to every worldly honor at\r\nthe risk of life or virtue. Ever mindful of her slightest wishes, her\r\nson listened respectfully to all her objections, and said all he could\r\nto quiet her motherly fears: but, feeling that he owed his highest\r\nduty to his country, he was not to be turned from his steadfast\r\npurpose; and, taking an affectionate leave of her, he set out to join\r\nhis general at Fort Cumberland.\r\n\r\nFort Cumberland was situated on Wills's Creek, and had just been built\r\nby Braddock as a gathering point for the border; and thither he had\r\nremoved his whole army, with all his stores, and munitions of war.\r\nUpon further acquaintance, Washington found this old veteran a man of\r\ncourteous though somewhat haughty manners, of a hasty and uneven\r\ntemper, strict and rigid in the discipline of his soldiers, much given\r\nto martial pomp and parade, and self-conceited and wilful to a degree\r\nthat was sometimes scarcely bearable. He was, however, of a sociable\r\nand hospitable turn; often inviting his officers to dine with him, and\r\nentertaining them like princes. So keen a relish had he for the good\r\nthings of the table, that he never travelled without his two cooks,\r\nwho were said to have been so uncommonly skilful in their line of\r\nbusiness, that they could take a pair of boots, and boil them down\r\ninto a very respectable dish of soup, give them only the seasoning to\r\nfinish it off with. The little folks, however, must be very cautious\r\nhow they receive this story, as their Uncle Juvinell will not\r\nundertake to vouch for the truth of it.\r\n\r\nThe contractors--that is to say, the men who had been engaged to\r\nfurnish the army with a certain number of horses, pack-saddles, and\r\nwagons, by a certain time, and for a certain consideration--had failed\r\nto be as good as their word, and had thereby seriously hindered the\r\nprogress of the campaign. As might have been expected, this was enough\r\nto throw such a man as Braddock into a towering passion; and, to mend\r\nhis humor, the governors of the different provinces were not as ready\r\nand brisk to answer his call for men and supplies as he thought he had\r\na right to expect.\r\n\r\nSo he poured forth his vials of wrath upon whomsoever or whatsoever\r\nchanced to come uppermost. He stormed at the contractors; he railed at\r\nthe governors, and sneered at the troops they sent him; he abused the\r\ncountry in general, and scolded about the bad roads in particular.\r\n\r\nWashington, with his usual clearness of insight into character, soon\r\nsaw, to his deep disappointment, that this was hardly the man to\r\nconduct a wilderness campaign to any thing like a successful end,\r\nhowever brave the testy old veteran might be, and expert in the\r\nmanagement of well-drilled regulars in the open and cultivated regions\r\nof the Old World. Of the same opinion was Dr. Franklin, who, being at\r\nthat time Postmaster-General of all the Colonies, came to Braddock's\r\nquarters at Fort Cumberland to make some arrangements for transporting\r\nthe mail to and from the army during the progress of the expedition. I\r\nwill read you his own lively account of this interview, as it will\r\nenable you to see more clearly those faults of Braddock's character\r\nthat so soon after brought ruin on his own head, and disgrace upon\r\nEnglish arms in America.\r\n\r\n     \"In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some\r\n     account of his intended progress. 'After taking Fort Duquesne,'\r\n     said he, 'I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that,\r\n     to Frontenac, if the season will allow; and I suppose it will,\r\n     for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days: and\r\n     then I can see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara.'\r\n\r\n     \"Having before revolved in my mind the long line his army must\r\n     make in their march by a very narrow road to be cut for them\r\n     through the woods and bushes, and also what I had heard of a\r\n     former defeat of fifteen hundred French who invaded the\r\n     Illinois country, I had conceived some doubts and some fears\r\n     for the event of the campaign; but I ventured only to say, 'To\r\n     be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne with these\r\n     fine troops, so well provided with artillery, the fort, though\r\n     completely fortified and assisted with a very strong garrison,\r\n     can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I\r\n     apprehend of obstruction to your march is from the ambuscades\r\n     of the Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in\r\n     laying and executing them; and the slender line, nearly four\r\n     miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be\r\n     attacked by surprise on its flanks, and to be cut like thread\r\n     into several pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up\r\n     in time to support one another.' He smiled at my ignorance, and\r\n     replied,\"'These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to\r\n     raw American militia; but upon the king's regular and\r\n     disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible they should make an\r\n     impression.'\r\n\r\n     \"I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a\r\n     military man in matters of his profession, and said no more.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of this interview, Franklin chanced to express a regret\r\nthat the army had not been landed in Pennsylvania, where, as every\r\nfarmer kept his own wagon and horses, better means would have been\r\nmore readily found for transporting the troops, with their heavy guns\r\nand munitions of war, across the country and over the mountains. Quick\r\nto take a hint, Braddock made haste to request him, as a man of\r\nstanding in his colony, to furnish him, in the king's name, one\r\nhundred and fifty wagons, and four horses to each wagon, besides a\r\nlarge number of pack-horses and pack-saddles. This, Franklin readily\r\nundertook to do; and went about it with such diligence, that by the\r\nlatter part of spring, even before the time set, he had fulfilled his\r\npromise to the last letter; and Braddock had now the satisfaction of\r\nseeing his army, after all these vexatious delays, in a condition to\r\nmove forward.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Washington was all attention to affairs in camp, and was\r\ndaily gaining fresh insight into the art of war, as understood and\r\npractised in the most civilized countries of the Old World. Every day\r\nthe men were drilled, and passed under review; their arms and\r\naccoutrements carefully inspected by their officers, to make sure that\r\nthey were in perfect order, and ready for use at a moment's notice.\r\nSentinels and guards were stationed in and about the camp, day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSo strict was the watch kept by this lynx-eyed old general over the\r\nmorals of his men, that drunkenness was punished with severe\r\nconfinement; and any one found guilty of theft was drummed out of his\r\nregiment, after receiving five hundred stripes on his bare back. Every\r\nSunday, the soldiers were called together, under the colors of their\r\nseparate regiments, to hear divine service performed by their\r\nchaplains.\r\n\r\nTo lend variety to the scene, the Indians of the neighboring\r\nwilderness came flocking in to join their fortunes with the English,\r\nor bring information of the movements or designs of the French. Among\r\nthese came his old friend and ally, White Thunder, keeper of the\r\nspeech-belt; and Silver Heels, a renowned warrior, so called, no\r\ndoubt, from his being uncommonly nimble of foot. Also, as we shall\r\nmeet him again hereafter, should be mentioned another sachem, whose\r\nIndian name the little folks must excuse their Uncle Juvinell from\r\ngiving them in full. By your leave, then, for the sake of brevity and\r\nconvenience, we will call him by the last two syllables of his name,\r\nYadi. From them Washington learned, much to his regret, that his red\r\nbrother, the Half King, had died a few months before; having, as the\r\nconjurors or medicine-men of his tribe pretended, been bewitched by\r\nthe French for the terrible blow he had dealt them at the battle of\r\nJumonville, which had filled them with such terror, that they dared\r\nnot hope for safety in the wide earth till certain that he walked and\r\nate and slept no more among living men.\r\n\r\nAlthough Braddock held these savage allies in high contempt, yet when\r\nWashington pointed out to him how much was to be gained by their\r\nfriendship, and how much to be lost by their enmity, he was persuaded,\r\nfor that one time at least, to treat them with marked respect and\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nTo give them an overwhelming idea of the power and splendor of English\r\narms, he received them with all the honors of war,--fifes playing,\r\ndrums beating, and the regulars lowering their muskets as they passed\r\non to the general's tent. Here Braddock received them in the midst of\r\nhis officers, and made them a speech of welcome, in the course of\r\nwhich he told them of the deep sorrow felt by their great father, the\r\nKing of England, for the death of his red brother, the Half King; and\r\nthat, to console his red children in America for so grievous a loss,\r\nas well as to reward them for their friendship and services to the\r\nEnglish, he had sent them many rich and handsome presents, which they\r\nshould receive before leaving the fort. This speech was answered by a\r\ndozen warriors in as many orations, which being very long and very\r\nflowery, and very little to the point, bored their English listeners\r\ndreadfully. The peace-pipe smoked and the Big Talk ended, Braddock, by\r\nway of putting a cap on the grand occasion, ordered all the fifes to\r\nplay, and drums to beat, and, in the midst of the music, all the guns\r\nin the fort to be fired at once. He then caused a bullock to be\r\nkilled, and roasted whole, for the refreshment of his Indian guests.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, in their turn, to show how sensible they were of the\r\nhonor done them by this distinguished reception, entertained the\r\nEnglish by dancing their war-dances and singing their war-songs: by\r\nwhich you are to understand that they jumped and whirled and capered\r\nabout in a thousand outlandish antics till they grew limber and weak\r\nin the knees, and yelped and bellowed and howled till their bodies\r\nwere almost empty of breath; when, from very exhaustion, they hushed\r\ntheir barbarous din, and night and slumber fell on the camp. In the\r\ndaytime, these lords of the forest, tricked out in all their savage\r\nfinery, their faces streaked with war-paint and their scalp-locks\r\nbrave with gay bunches of feathers, would stalk about the fort, big\r\nwith wonder over every thing they saw. Now and then, they would follow\r\nwith admiring eyes the rapid and skilful movement of the red-coated\r\nregulars, as one or other of the regiments, like some huge machine,\r\nwent through their martial exercises; or, standing on the ramparts,\r\nthey would watch with still keener zest and interest the young\r\nofficers as they amused themselves by racing their horses outside the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nAs ill luck would have it, these warriors had brought with them their\r\nwives and children, among whom were many very pretty Indian girls,\r\nwith plump, round forms, little hands and feet, and beady, roguish\r\neyes. As female society was not by any means one of the charms of life\r\nat Fort Cumberland, the coming of these wild beauties was hailed with\r\nthe liveliest delight by the young English officers, who, the moment\r\nthey laid eyes on them, fell to loving them to desperation. First\r\namong these forest belles was one who went by the expressive name of\r\nBright Lightning; so called, no doubt, from being the favorite\r\ndaughter of White Thunder. It being noised abroad that she was a\r\nsavage princess of the very first blood, she, of course, at once\r\nbecame the centre of fashionable attraction, and the leading toast of\r\nall the young blades in camp. No sooner, however, did the warriors get\r\nwind of these gallantries, than they were quite beside themselves with\r\nrage and jealousy, and straightway put an end to them; making the\r\nerring fair ones pack off home, bag and baggage, sorely to their\r\ndisappointment, as well as to that of the young British lions, who\r\nwere quite inconsolable for their loss.\r\n\r\nThis scandalous behavior on the part of the English--of which,\r\nhowever, your Uncle Juvinell may have spoken more lightly than he\r\nought--was, as you may well believe, very disgusting to Washington,\r\nwho was a young man of the purest thoughts and habits. As may be\r\nnaturally supposed, it gave deep and lasting offence to the sachems;\r\nand when to this is coupled the fact, that their wishes and opinions\r\ntouching war-matters were never heeded or consulted, we cannot wonder\r\nthat they one by one forsook the English, with all their warriors, and\r\ncame no more.\r\n\r\nForeseeing this, and well knowing what valuable service these people\r\ncould render as scouts and spies, Washington had gone to Braddock,\r\ntime and again, warning him to treat them with more regard to their\r\npeculiar whims and customs, if he did not wish to lose the advantages\r\nto be expected from their friendship, or bring upon him the terrible\r\nconsequences of their enmity. As this wise and timely advice came from\r\na young provincial colonel, the wrong-headed old general treated it,\r\nof course, with high disdain, and to the last remained obstinate in\r\nthe belief that he could march to the very heart of the continent\r\nwithout meeting an enemy who could withstand his well-drilled regulars\r\nand fine artillery.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my dear children, did this rash and wilful man cast lightly\r\naway the golden opportunity, wherein, by a few kind words, or tokens\r\nof respect, he could have gained the lasting friendship of this\r\nmuch-despised race, and thereby made them, in all human likelihood,\r\nthe humble means of saving from early destruction the finest army,\r\nwhich, up to that time, had carried its banners to the Western World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nROUGH WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, all things were got in readiness; and the gallant little army\r\nbegan its toilsome march through the forest, and over the mountains,\r\nand up and down the valleys. Beside the regulars, fourteen hundred\r\nstrong, it consisted of two companies of hatchet-men, or carpenters,\r\nwhose business it was to go on before, and open the road; a small\r\ncompany of seamen, who had the care and management of the artillery;\r\nsix companies of rangers, some of whom were Pennsylvanians; and two\r\ncompanies of light horse, which, being composed of young men taken\r\nfrom the very first families of Virginia, Braddock had chosen to be\r\nhis body-guard: the whole numbering two thousand, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of dragging the loaded wagons and heavy guns\r\nover the steep and rocky roads, the march was slow and tedious in the\r\nextreme; and what made it still more trying to Washington's patience\r\nwas to see so many wagons and pack-horses loaded down with the private\r\nbaggage of the English officers,--such as fine clothing, table\r\ndainties, and a hundred little troublesome conveniences, which they\r\nmust needs lug about with them wherever they went. Weeks before they\r\nleft Fort Cumberland, Washington had pointed out to Braddock the folly\r\nof attempting to cross that monstrous mountain barrier with a cumbrous\r\ntrain of wheel-carriages; and expressed the opinion, that, for the\r\npresent, they had better leave the bulk of their baggage and their\r\nheaviest artillery, and, trusting entirely to pack-horses for\r\ntransporting what should be needed most, make their way at once to\r\nFort Duquesne while the garrison was yet too weak to offer any\r\nresistance. This prudent counsel, however, as usual, had failed to\r\nproduce the least effect on the narrow and stubborn mind of Braddock;\r\nbut by the time he had dragged his unwieldy length over two or three\r\nmountains, and had made but a few miles in many days, it began to dawn\r\non his mind by slow degrees, that a campaign in an American wilderness\r\nwas a very different thing from what it was in the cultivated regions\r\nof Europe, where nearly every meadow, field, or wood, could tell of a\r\nChristian and civilized battle there fought, and where the fine roads\r\nand bridges made the march of an army a mere holiday jaunt as compared\r\nto this rough service. The difficulties that beset him seeming to\r\nthicken around him at every step, he was at last so sorely put to it\r\nand perplexed as to be obliged to turn to the young provincial\r\ncolonel for that advice which he, in his blind self-confidence, had\r\nbut a short while before disdained.\r\n\r\nToo well bred to seem surprised at this unbending of the haughty old\r\ngeneral, although he really was not a little, Washington readily, yet\r\nwith all becoming modesty, did as he was desired, in a clear, brief,\r\nand soldierly manner. He gave it as his opinion, that their best plan\r\nwould be to divide the army into two parts,--the smaller division,\r\nunder command of Col. Dunbar, to form the rear, and bring up the heavy\r\nguns and baggage-wagons; the larger division, under the command of\r\nBraddock, to form the advance, and taking with it but two pieces of\r\nlight artillery, and no more baggage than could be conveniently\r\ncarried on pack-horses, push rapidly on to Fort Duquesne, and surprise\r\nthe garrison before they could receive timely warning of their danger,\r\nor be re-enforced by the troops from Canada, which would have arrived\r\nere then, had not the summer drought prevented. To some extent, this\r\nprudent advice was followed; and, to give it the force of example,\r\nWashington reduced his baggage to a few little necessaries that he\r\ncould easily carry in a small portmanteau strapped to his back, and\r\ngave his fine charger to be used as a pack-horse. His brother\r\nprovincial officers, accustomed as they were to dealing with the\r\ndifficulties and inconveniences of a backwoods life, in a ready,\r\noff-hand fashion, followed his example with the greatest willingness\r\nand good-humor. Notwithstanding this, however, there were still two\r\nhundred pack-horses loaded with the private baggage of the English\r\nofficers, who were unwilling, even in that hour of pressing need, to\r\nmake this little sacrifice of their present comfort to the common\r\ngood. So tender did they seem of their bodily ease, and so given up to\r\nthe pleasures of appetite, that Washington began to have serious\r\ndoubts of their fitness to endure the hardships of a rough campaign,\r\nand of their courage and firmness to face the dangers of the\r\nbattle-field.\r\n\r\nOne evening late, about this time, as the army lay encamped at the\r\nLittle Meadows, there suddenly appeared among them, from the\r\nneighboring woods, a large party of hunters, all Pennsylvanians,\r\ndressed in the wild garb of Indians, and armed with hatchets, knives,\r\nand rifles. Their leader was a certain Capt. Jack, one of the greatest\r\nhunters of his day, and nearly as famous in the border tales of\r\nPennsylvania as Daniel Boone in those of green Kentucky. When your\r\nUncle Juvinell was quite a lad, he read the story of this strange man,\r\nin an old book, which pleased and interested him so much at the time,\r\nthat he has never since forgotten it, and will now repeat it to you in\r\nthe very words of the old chronicler:--\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Black Hunter,' the 'Black Rifle,' the 'Wild Hunter of\r\n     Juniata,' is a white man. His history is this: He entered the\r\n     woods with a few enterprising companions, built his cabin,\r\n     cleared a little land, and amused himself with the pleasure of\r\n     fishing and hunting. He felt happy; for then he had not a care.\r\n     But on an evening, when he returned from a day of sport, he\r\n     found his cabin burnt, his wife and children murdered. From\r\n     that moment he forsakes civilized man, hunts out caves in which\r\n     he lives, protects the frontier inhabitants from the Indians,\r\n     and seizes every opportunity of revenge that offers. He lives\r\n     the terror of the Indians, and the consolation of the whites.\r\n     On one occasion, near Juniata, in the middle of a dark night, a\r\n     family were suddenly awaked from sleep by the report of a gun.\r\n     They jumped from their huts; and, by the glimmering light from\r\n     the chimney, saw an Indian fall to rise no more. The open door\r\n     exposed to view the Wild Hunter. 'I have saved your lives!' he\r\n     cried; then turned, and was buried in the gloom of night.\"\r\n\r\nBidding his leather-stockings to wait where they were till he came\r\nback, the Black Hunter strode on to the general's tent, and, without\r\nmore ado than to enter, made known the object of his coming there, in\r\na speech that smacked somewhat of the Indian style of oratory; which I\r\nwill give you, as nearly as I can, in his own words:--\r\n\r\n     \"Englishmen, the foe is on the watch. He lurks in the\r\n     strongholds of the mountains. He hides in the shadows of the\r\n     forest. He hovers over you like a hungry vulture ready to\r\n     pounce upon its prey. He has made a boast that he will keep his\r\n     eye upon you, from his look-outs on the hills, day and night,\r\n     till you have walked into his snare, when he will shoot down\r\n     your gay red-birds like pigeons. Englishmen, dangers thicken\r\n     round you at every step; but in the pride of your strength you\r\n     have blinded your eyes, so that you see them not. I have\r\n     brought my hunters, who are brave and trusty men, to serve you\r\n     as scouts and spies. In your front and in your rear, and on\r\n     either hand, we will scour the woods, and beat the bushes, to\r\n     stir up the lurking foe, that your gallant men fall not into\r\n     his murderous ambuscade. To us the secret places of the\r\n     wilderness are as an open book; in its depths we have made our\r\n     homes this many a year: there we can find both food and\r\n     shelter. We ask no pay, and our rifles are all our own.\"\r\n\r\nTo this noble and disinterested offer, Braddock returned a cold and\r\nhaughty answer.\r\n\r\n     \"There is time enough,\" said he, \"for making such arrangements;\r\n     and I have experienced troops on whom I can rely.\"\r\n\r\nStung to the quick by this uncivil and ungenerous treatment, the Black\r\nHunter, without another word, turned, and, with a kindling eye and\r\nproud step, left the tent. When he told his followers of the scornful\r\nmanner in which the English general had treated their leader, and\r\nrejected their offer of service, they staid not, but, with angry and\r\nindignant mien, filed out of the camp, and, plunging once more into\r\nthe wilderness, left the devoted little army to march on to that\r\ndestruction to which its ill-starred commander seemed so fatally bent\r\non leading it. The contemptuous indifference which always marked the\r\ndemeanor of Braddock towards these rude but brave and trusty warriors\r\nof the woods was very offensive to Washington; the more, as he knew,\r\nthat, when it came to be put to the test, these men, unskilled though\r\nthey were in the modes of civilized warfare, would be found far better\r\nfitted to cope with the cunning and stealthy enemy they had then to\r\ndeal with, than those well-dressed, well-armed, well-drilled, but\r\nunwieldy regulars.\r\n\r\nAfter having rested a few days at the Little Meadows, the advanced\r\ndivision of the army once more took up the line of march; but, to\r\nWashington's disappointment, made scarcely better speed than before,\r\nalthough lightened of nearly all of the heavy baggage. \"I found,\"\r\nwrote he a short time after, \"that, instead of pushing on with vigor,\r\nwe were halting to level every mole-hill, and erect bridges over every\r\nbrook; by which means we were sometimes four days in getting twelve\r\nmiles.\" Slowly the long and straggling lines held on their weary way,\r\nnow scrambling over some rugged steep, now winding along some narrow\r\ndefile, till at length the silence of that gloomy vale--the Shades of\r\nDeath--was again broken by the shouts and uproar of a marching army.\r\n\r\nFor several days, Washington had been suffering much from fever,\r\nattended with a racking headache, which had obliged him to travel in a\r\ncovered wagon. By the time they reached the great crossings of the\r\nYoughiogeny, his illness had so increased, that Dr. Craik, his good\r\nfriend and physician, declared it would be almost certain death for\r\nhim to travel further; at the same time advising him to stay where he\r\nwas until his fever should somewhat abate its violence, when he could\r\ncome up with Dunbar's rear division. His brother officers also, and\r\neven his old general, kindly urged him to give up all thought of going\r\non for the present; while, to render his disappointment more bearable,\r\nsome of them promised to keep him informed, by writing, of every thing\r\nnoteworthy which should happen in the course of their march. Seeing\r\nthen; was no help for it, he suffered himself to be left behind: but\r\nit was with a sad and heavy heart that, he saw them pass on without\r\nhim; and when they had vanished, one by one, in the shadows of the\r\nneighboring wilds, and the gleaming of their arms could no longer be\r\nseen through the openings of the trees and bushes, he turned with a\r\nsigh, and said to the men whom Braddock had left to nurse and guard\r\nhim, \"I would not for five hundred pounds miss being at the taking of\r\nFort Duquesne.\" Here he lay for ten days; his fever, no doubt, much\r\naggravated by his impatience to rejoin his comrades, and the fear lest\r\nhe should not be well in time to share with them the dangers and\r\nhonors of the coming contest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Braddock pursued his slow and tedious march, and in a few\r\ndays had passed the Great Meadows, where young Washington, the year\r\nbefore, as you must well remember, had learned his first lessons in\r\nthe rude art of war. A few miles beyond this, he came to a deserted\r\nIndian camp, on the top of a rocky hill, where, to judge from the\r\nnumber of wigwams, at least one hundred and seventy warriors must have\r\nlodged. The fires were still burning; which showed but too plainly\r\nthat the stealthy foe was on the watch, and not far distant. Some of\r\nthe trees hard by had been stripped of their bark; and on their white,\r\nsappy trunks were to be seen, in the rude picture-writing of the\r\nIndians, savage taunts and threats of vengeance meant for the English;\r\nwhile intermixed with these were bullying boasts and blackguard slang,\r\nwritten in the French language, as if to force on the notice of those\r\nwho were to read them the fact, that there were white as well as red\r\nmen lurking near.\r\n\r\nIt had almost slipped my mind to tell you, that Braddock, moved\r\nperhaps by the advice of Washington, had, before setting out from Fort\r\nCumberland, employed a small party of Indians, with their sachem Yadi\r\nat their head, to serve as guides and spies during the campaign. A few\r\ndays after passing the deserted camp on the rock, four or five\r\nsoldiers, straggling too far in the rear, were suddenly waylaid by the\r\nprowling foe, and all murdered and scalped on the spot.\r\n\r\nTo avenge the death of their comrades, a squad of regulars went out\r\nin quest of the enemy, and soon came in sight of a small party of\r\nIndians, who held up the boughs of trees before them, and stood their\r\nrifles on the ground, as a sign that they were friends. Not\r\nunderstanding this, however, and the distance being too great for them\r\nto make out who they were, the blundering regulars fired, and one of\r\nthe party fell dead on the spot,--a youthful warrior, who proved to be\r\nthe son of the sachem Yadi. When Braddock heard of this melancholy\r\naccident, he was deeply grieved. He forthwith sent for the bereaved\r\nfather, and, to his praise be it ever recorded, endeavored, by kind\r\nwords and liberal presents, to console him, and make some little\r\namends for his heavy loss; and, as a still further token of his\r\nregard, he ordered the hapless youth to be buried with all the honors\r\nof war. The body, borne on a bier, was followed by the officers, two\r\nand two; while the soldiers, drawn up in two lines, with the grave\r\nbetween them, stood facing each other, with the points of their\r\nmuskets turned downward, and their chins resting in the hollow of the\r\nbreeches. When the body was lowered, they fired three volleys over the\r\ngrave, and left the young warrior to his long sleep on the hillside,\r\nwith his bright hatchet and trusty rifle beside him. All this was very\r\nsoothing to the sorrow and gratifying to the fatherly pride of the old\r\nsachem, and made him ever after a loving friend and faithful ally of\r\nthe English. I have told you this little story to show you, that this\r\ntesty and obstinate old general, with all his faults, was far from\r\nbeing the hard, unfeeling man that he sometimes seemed; and also as a\r\ntribute that every historian should pay to the memory of one whose\r\nmisfortune it has been to be blamed so much, and pitied so little.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Washington had so far regained his strength as to admit\r\nof his being borne along in a covered wagon; and, setting out\r\naccordingly, in five days came up with the advance division, where it\r\nlay encamped in a beautiful spot about two miles from the Monongahela,\r\nand fifteen miles from Fort Duquesne. Here he was joyfully welcomed by\r\nboth officers and men, with whom his generosity, and frank, manly\r\nbearing, had made him a great favorite. Shortly after his arrival, Mr.\r\nGist and two Indian scouts, who had been sent out to reconnoitre or\r\nspy out the enemy, came back with the cheering tidings, that the\r\nre-enforcements had not yet come down from Canada, and that the\r\ngarrison in the fort was at present too weak to stand a single hour's\r\nsiege. But what gave him a little uneasiness was a lofty column of\r\nsmoke, rising from a deep and densely wooded hollow, where they were\r\nquite sure the watchful enemy was lurking, and hatching some mischief\r\nfor the English.\r\n\r\nNow, the fort and the camp lay on the same side of the river; and the\r\nmost direct route between them was by a narrow mountain pass, rising\r\nabruptly from the water's edge on the left, and, on the right, shut\r\nin by a steep and lofty hill, whose stony sides were overgrown with\r\nlaurel and stunted cedars and pines. As it was altogether out of the\r\nquestion to drag their wagons and artillery along this pass, it was\r\nresolved to cross the river, first at a point just over against the\r\ncamp, and then, moving down along the opposite bank, recross it at\r\nanother point five miles below; at both of which places the fords were\r\nshallow, and the banks not high.\r\n\r\nAt last, the 9th of July, 1755,--a day ever to be remembered in\r\nAmerican annals,--began to dawn. Long before its first red light had\r\nstreaked the east, a hum in the camp told that the little army was,\r\neven at that hour, all astir, and big with the bustle of preparation.\r\nOfficers and men were in the highest hopes, and looked forward with\r\nconfidence to the coming evening, when they were to plant their\r\nvictorious banners on the ramparts of Fort Duquesne. Although they had\r\nmarched thus far without serious molestation, yet Col. Washington's\r\nfears of an ambuscade were not a whit diminished; for he felt quite\r\ncertain that they should never reach the French fort without an\r\nattempt being made to surprise, or drive them back. Full of these\r\napprehensions, he went to Gen. Braddock, and, pointing out to him the\r\ndanger hanging over them, urged him by all means to send out the\r\nVirginia rangers to scour the woods and thickets, front and flank, and\r\nbeat up the enemy, should any chance to be lurking near with the\r\ndesign of drawing them into an ambuscade. No advice, as it afterwards\r\nturned out, could have been more timely: but, coming from a raw\r\nprovincial colonel, Braddock cast it aside with angry impatience; and\r\nwhen the line of march was formed, as if to show in what light esteem\r\nhe held it, he ordered the rangers to the rear, to guard the baggage.\r\nBefore daybreak, a large party of pioneers, or road-cutters, with a\r\nsmall guard of regulars, numbering in all about three hundred, had\r\ngone on before to open a passage for the army through the woods, and\r\nmake the fords more passable by levelling the banks.\r\n\r\nThe midsummer sun was shooting its first beams, level and red, among\r\nthe Alleghany hills, when the little army, having crossed the\r\nMonongahela at the upper ford, stood on its southern bank, forming in\r\nline of march. By order of their general, officers and men had scoured\r\nand polished their arms and accoutrements the night before; and now\r\nappeared in full uniform, as if some grand military parade were to be\r\nthe programme of the day. The whole line was soon moving slowly\r\nforward, with fifes playing, drums beating, and colors flying; the\r\nregulars keeping step the while to the \"Grenadier's March.\" In the\r\nclear and tranquil depths of the river, as they moved along its shady\r\nbanks, could be seen, as in a mirror, the long array of\r\nleather-shirted rangers and red-coated regulars, with their sun-lit\r\narms and prancing steeds, and bright banners that floated in the\r\nmorning breeze. This brilliant spectacle, so well set off by the\r\nsmiling river in front and the frowning woods beyond, formed a picture\r\nthat ever lived in the memory of Washington; and in after-years he\r\nused often to say, that, as it then appeared to him, he thought he had\r\nnever seen any thing so beautiful. In the enthusiasm of the moment, he\r\nforgot his late illness, the still enfeebled condition of his\r\nbody,--all, save the glory of serving his country; and, mounting his\r\nhorse, he joined his brother-aides in their attendance on their\r\ngeneral, else far more fatal must have been the end of that bloody\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nBRADDOCK'S DEFEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my account of this battle, as well as all the others that will come\r\nthundering in upon us from time to time in the course of our story, I\r\nhave thought it would suit our purpose best to touch upon those facts\r\nonly that are likeliest to leave the most lasting pictures of such\r\nevents on your minds; using the while no more words than may actually\r\nbe needed to give clearness and completeness to the same. And now,\r\nDaniel, my young Herodotus, and Ned, my young Hannibal, bring in\r\nanother Christmas log, that we may have a more cheerful blaze; for our\r\nstory will be doleful enough for the next half-hour, without these\r\ngoblin shadows dodging and flitting about the room to make it more so.\r\n\r\nAt mid-day, Braddock's army came to the lower ford, where a halt was\r\ncalled to allow of a few minutes' rest. Far in front, across the\r\nriver, the ringing of a hundred axes, followed at short intervals by\r\nthe crash of falling trees, could be distinctly heard; telling that\r\nthe pioneers were there, working might and main to clear a passage for\r\nthose behind. The road just opened, after leaving the ford, ran\r\nacross a heavily wooded bottom that skirted the river; and thence, for\r\na few hundred yards, up a rocky slope to the foot of a high range of\r\nhills, about a mile distant, where it entered a narrow, bushy defile,\r\nand went no further. The country, for miles and miles around, as far\r\nas the eye could reach, was thickly wooded, save the rocky slope just\r\nmentioned, and the neighboring ravines, which were overgrown with\r\nlong, coarse grass and whortleberry-bushes, so high as to sweep the\r\nhorses' bellies; with here and there a few scattering trees of some\r\nsize. It was the very place, of all others, that the wily Indian would\r\nbe most likely to choose for his ambuscade.\r\n\r\nBy two o'clock, the whole army had regained the northern bank of the\r\nriver. They were now within ten miles of Fort Duquesne, and a lucky\r\nend to their present campaign seemed near at hand. In a few minutes,\r\nartillery and baggage, foot and horse, regulars and rangers, formed\r\ninto separate and distinct columns, stood ready to move as soon as the\r\nword should be given. Just at the moment, however, when they were\r\nlistening to hear the order, \"Forward, march!\" drop from their\r\ngeneral's lips, they were startled by a sudden and heavy firing among\r\nthe hills, which put a sudden stop to the hundred axes, and told but\r\ntoo plainly that the road-cutters and their guard of regulars had been\r\ndrawn into an ambuscade. Washington knew at once, and too well, that\r\nthe evil he dreaded from the beginning, had, on the very eve of\r\nsuccess, come upon them; and with it also came the painful reflection,\r\nthat it would never have so befallen them, had the rangers been\r\nsuffered to scour the woods, and beat up the enemy, as had been\r\nrecommended by him but a few hours before. Braddock forthwith ordered\r\ntwo companies to hurry on to the relief of the pioneers; and, at his\r\nbidding, one of his aides spurred forward to learn further of the\r\nmatter, and bring him word. The firing grew heavier and heavier, and\r\nseemed to be coming nearer and nearer. The lonely hills and woods\r\naround rang with the whoops and yells of the unseen savages. Not able\r\nto restrain his impatience till his aide came back, Braddock ordered\r\nhis main division to come up at double-quick; and, taking with him his\r\ntwo remaining aides and a small guard of light-horse, galloped up to\r\nthe scene of action. Here what was his rage and mortification to find\r\nhis doughty regulars, of whom he had boasted so much, changed, as it\r\nwere in the whistling of a bullet, into a mere disorderly rabble of\r\nred-coats,--confused, bewildered, to a degree that he could never have\r\ndreamed possible! Crowded and huddled together in the narrow road, he\r\nsaw them dropping down under the Indian bullets, helpless as a herd of\r\nfrightened deer beset by a band of unseen hunters.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Indians, still hid from view by the grass and\r\nbushes, had stretched their lines along either side of the road, from\r\nthe hollows among the hills to some distance down the rocky slope, and\r\nwere pouring in a murderous fire upon the affrighted English; yelling\r\nand whooping the while like a legion of devils at some infernal\r\nfrolic. Two bayonet charges had been made to drive them from their\r\nhiding-places, but in vain. The regulars, notwithstanding their\r\nofficers' orders to the contrary, kept up a hurried but random firing,\r\nwhich had little or no effect upon the enemy, as nothing could be seen\r\nof him but the puffs of rifle-smoke that rose and hovered in little\r\nblue clouds over his place of ambush. The English, it is said, were\r\nless appalled by the whistling bullet; of the unseen savages than by\r\ntheir unearthly yells,--a sound that none of them had ever heard\r\nbefore, and many a poor fellow of them never heard again. The Indian\r\nwar-whoop has been described as a sound so wild and terrible, that,\r\nwhen once heard in battle, it rings in the listener's ears for weeks\r\nthereafter, and is never forgotten even to his dying day.\r\n\r\nBut the English officers, on the contrary, behaved themselves with a\r\ngallantry that filled Washington with astonishment and admiration.\r\nHeretofore he had seen them only in camp or on the line of march,\r\nwhere their habits of ease and self-indulgence had led him to doubt\r\ntheir having the courage and firmness to face, without shrinking,\r\ndanger in such appalling forms. Unmindful of the bullets that whistled\r\ncontinually about their heads, they galloped up and down the broken\r\nand bleeding lines, in the vain endeavor to rally their men, and bring\r\nthem again to something like order. Mounted on fine horses, and\r\ndressed in rich uniforms, they offered a tempting mark to the unseen\r\nrifles that were levelled at them from behind every tree and bush, and\r\ntuft of grass; and, ere the work of death was finished, many a gallant\r\nsteed, with dangling reins and bloody saddle, dashed riderless about\r\nthe field. And, as if this were not enough, many of them must needs\r\nfall victims to the unsoldierly conduct of their own men, who,\r\nforgetful of all discipline, and quite beside themselves with terror\r\nand bewilderment, loaded their pieces hurriedly, and fired them off at\r\nrandom, killing friends as well as foes. Nor did this most shameful\r\npart of the bloody scene end here: many of the Virginia rangers, who\r\nhad already taken to the trees and bushes, and were doing good service\r\nby fighting the Indians in their own fashion, were shot down by the\r\nblundering regulars, who fired into the woods wherever they saw a puff\r\nof smoke, unable to distinguish whether it rose from a red or a white\r\nman's rifle. Upon these brave rangers the brunt of the battle fell;\r\nand indeed, had it not been for their firmness and presence of mind,\r\ntheir skill and address in the arts and strategems of Indian warfare,\r\nwhich enabled them for a time to hold the enemy in check, hardly a\r\nremnant of Braddock's fine army would have survived to behold the\r\ngoing-down of that summer's sun.\r\n\r\nAt the very commencement of the battle, a small party of warriors,\r\ncheered on by a French officer in a fancifully trimmed hunting-shirt,\r\nhad leaped out from their covert into the road, with the view, it\r\nseemed, of cutting off those in front from the assistance of their\r\ncomrades in the rear; but the regulars, who guarded the road-cutters,\r\nhaving discharged a well-aimed volley of musketry into their very\r\nfaces, they had turned, and fled with even more haste than they had\r\ncome, leaving behind them several of their number dead on the spot,\r\nand among these their dashing French leader. After that, they had\r\ntaken care to keep close under cover of the grass and bushes. Now and\r\nthen, however, a tall brave, grim and hideous with war-paint, with a\r\nyell of defiance would leap from his ambush, and, darting into the\r\nroad, tomahawk and scalp a wounded officer just fallen; then vanish\r\nagain as suddenly as if the earth had opened to swallow him up.\r\n\r\nAll this while, Col. Washington had borne himself with a firmness,\r\ncourage, and presence of mind, that would have done honor to a\r\nforty-years' veteran. His two brother aides-de-camp having been\r\nwounded early in the engagement, the whole duty of carrying the\r\ngeneral's orders had fallen on him; and nobly did he that day\r\ndischarge it. Although brave men were falling thick and fast on every\r\nside, yet he shrank from no exposure, however perilous, did his duty\r\nbut lead him there. Mounted on horseback, his tall and stately form\r\nwas to be seen in every part of the field, the mark of a hundred\r\nrifles, whose deadly muzzles were pointed at him whithersoever he\r\nwent. Two horses were shot dead under him, and his coat was pierced\r\nwith bullets; but he seemed to bear about him a charmed life, and went\r\nunharmed. His danger was so great, that his friend Dr. Craik, who\r\nwatched his movements with anxious interest, looked every moment to\r\nsee him fall headlong to the ground; and that he came off alive seemed\r\nto him a miracle. Washington himself, with that piety which ever\r\nmarked his character, laid his deliverance from the perils of that\r\nfatal day to the overruling care of a kind and watchful Providence.\r\n\r\nAlthough brought thus suddenly face to face with new and untried\r\ndangers, Braddock bore himself throughout the day like the valiant man\r\nthat he really was. The bullets and yells of the invisible foe he\r\nscarcely noticed, as he galloped hither and thither about the field,\r\ngiving his orders through a speaking-trumpet, whose brazen voice rose\r\nloud and hoarse above the din of battle. Under the mistaken notion\r\nthat a savage enemy, hid in a thicket, was to be dealt with as a\r\ncivilized one in an open plain, he sought to recover his lost ground\r\nby forming his men into companies and battalions; which, however, he\r\nhad no sooner done, than they were mowed down by the murderous fire\r\nfrom the ambush, that had never ceased. \"My soldiers,\" said he, \"would\r\nfight, could they but see their enemy; but it is vain to shoot at\r\ntrees and bushes.\" Whereupon Washington urgently besought him to let\r\nhis regulars fight the Indians in their own fashion, which would the\r\nbetter enable them to pick off the lurking foe with less danger to\r\ntheir own safety. But Braddock's only answer to this was a sneer; and\r\nsome of his regulars, who were already acting upon the suggestion, he\r\nangrily ordered back into the ranks, calling them cowards, and even\r\nstriking them with the flat of his sword. He then caused the colors of\r\nthe two regiments to be advanced in different parts of the field, that\r\nthe soldiers might rally around their separate standards. It was all\r\nin vain. In his excitement, he cheered, he entreated, he swore, he\r\nstormed: it was only a waste of breath; for the poor fellows were too\r\ndisheartened and broken, too overcome by mortal fear, to rally again.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington, seeing that the day was on the point of being lost,\r\ngalloped down to the rear to see if nothing could be done with the\r\nartillery; but he found the gunners in a most disorderly plight,\r\nbenumbed with terror, and utterly unable to manage their guns. What\r\nWashington did on this occasion, I had better tell you in the words of\r\nan old Pennsylvania soldier, who was there at the time, and survived\r\nthe battle for half a hundred years or more; and used often, for the\r\nentertainment of your Uncle Juvinell and other little boys, to fight\r\nhis battles over again as he sat smoking in his chimney corner.\r\n\r\n     \"I saw Col. Washington,\" he would say, \"spring from his panting\r\n     horse, and seize a brass field-piece as if it had been a stick.\r\n     His look was terrible. He put his right hand on the muzzle, his\r\n     left hand on the breech; he pulled with this, he pushed with\r\n     that, and wheeled it round, as if it had been a plaything: it\r\n     furrowed the ground like a ploughshare. He tore the sheet-lead\r\n     from the touch-hole; then the powder-monkey rushed up with the\r\n     fire, when the cannon went off, making the bark fly from the\r\n     trees, and many an Indian send up his last yell and bite the\r\n     dust.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, gave the savages but a momentary check, as he could not\r\nfollow it up; there being no one by ready and willing to lend him a\r\nhelping hand. The Virginia rangers and other provincial troops, who\r\nhad done the only good fighting of the day, were thinned out to\r\none-fourth their number; and the few that remained were too weary and\r\nfaint to hold out longer against such fearful odds. Between the\r\nwell-aimed firing of the enemy and the random shooting of the\r\nregulars, the slaughter of the English officers had been frightful:\r\nout of the eighty-six who went into the battle, only twenty-four came\r\noff unhurt. Gen. Braddock had five horses killed under him. By this\r\ntime, he had given up all hope of regaining the day; and, galling as\r\nit must have been to his proud spirit, was at last forced to think of\r\nretreating as their only chance of safety. Just as he was on the\r\npoint, however, of giving orders to this effect, a bullet--said by\r\nsome to have been a random shot from one of his own soldiers--passed\r\nthrough his arm, and, lodging itself in his lungs, brought him to the\r\nground, mortally wounded. His officers placed him in a tumbrel, or\r\npioneer's cart, and bore him from the field, where, in his despair, he\r\nprayed them to leave him to die.\r\n\r\nSeeing their leader fall, a fresh panic seized the army. And now\r\nfollowed a wild and disorderly rout, the like of which was never known\r\nbefore, and has never since been known, in our border-wars. The\r\nsoldiers in front fell back on those in the centre; those in the\r\ncentre fell back on those in the rear: till foot and horse, artillery\r\nand baggage, were jammed and jumbled together, making a scene of\r\ndismay and confusion it would be vain for me to attempt to describe.\r\nTo add wings to their speed, the Indians, with a long, loud yell of\r\nfiendish triumph, now rushed from their ambush, and, brandishing aloft\r\ntheir murderous tomahawks, began to press hard on the heels of the\r\nterrified fugitives. The better to elude their savage pursuers, the\r\nregulars threw away their arms, the gunners abandoned their guns, and\r\nthe teamsters cut their horses from the traces, and, mounting them,\r\nfled, never halting until they reached Col. Dunbar's camp,--a gallop\r\nof forty miles. A few fell under the tomahawk before the farther bank\r\nof the river could be gained. Here, luckily for the survivors, the\r\nIndians gave over the pursuit, in their eagerness to plunder the\r\nslain, and gather what else of booty might be found on the field.\r\n\r\nThus ended this bloody battle, or rather slaughter; for in truth it\r\ncould be called nothing else. Of the sixteen hundred valiant men who\r\nhad that morning, in all the bright array of gleaming arms and waving\r\nbanners, marched along the banks of that beautiful river, nearly\r\none-half, ere the sun went down, had fallen on Braddock's Hill. What\r\nmade this disaster more shameful still was the weakness of the enemy's\r\nforce, which did not exceed eight hundred, of whom only a fourth were\r\nFrench; and, of all this number, scarcely forty fell in the fight.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington was now ordered to ride back with all speed to\r\nDunbar's camp, to fetch horses, wagons, and hospital-stores for the\r\nrelief of the wounded. Although still quite weak from his ten days'\r\nfever, which indeed had left him with no more strength than should\r\nhave sufficed for the fatigues of that trying day, yet he set out on\r\nthe instant, and, taking with him a guard of grenadiers, travelled the\r\nlivelong night. What with those terrible sights and sounds still\r\nringing in his ears, and flashing before his eyes; what with the\r\nthought of the many dead and dying that lay on the lonely hillside far\r\nbehind, with their ghastly upturned faces, more ghastly still in the\r\nlight of the moon; and what with the bitter, bitter reflection, that\r\nall this would never have been but for the pride and folly of a single\r\nman,--that ride through the dark and silent woods must have been a\r\nmelancholy one indeed. He pushed on, without leaving the saddle, till\r\nlate in the afternoon of the following day, when he reached Dunbar's\r\ncamp; and gathering together, without loss of time, the necessaries\r\nfor which he had been sent, started on his return that same night,\r\nscarcely allowing himself and men an hour for food and rest. Early\r\nnext morning, he met the main division at Mr. Gist's plantation,\r\nwhither they had dragged their shattered lines the evening before.\r\nFrom thence they all went on together to the Great Meadows, where they\r\narrived that same day, and halted.\r\n\r\nFor the four and twenty hours following the battle, Braddock had\r\nremained sad and silent; never speaking except to say, \"Who would have\r\nthought it?\" The second day, he seemed more cheerful; for he said, \"We\r\nshall better know how to deal with them another time.\" He spoke in\r\nhigh praise of the skill and courage shown by the Virginia rangers and\r\nother provincial troops during the whole engagement. He now saw, but\r\ntoo late, and to his deep regret, that he had not given these rough\r\nand hardy men half the credit due them as good soldiers; and also that\r\nhe had made a fatal mistake in underrating the strength, skill, and\r\naddress of the enemy he had been sent there to subdue. To Washington\r\nhe made a frank and manly apology for the contempt and impatience with\r\nwhich he had so often treated his prudent and well-timed counsel. As\r\nif wishing to make still further amends for this, he bequeathed to him\r\nhis faithful negro servant, Bishop, and his fine white charger, both\r\nof whom had helped to carry their wounded master from the field. On\r\nthe fourth day after the battle, he died; having been kindly and\r\ntenderly cared for by Washington and his other surviving officers.\r\n\r\nThey dug him a grave by the roadside, not a stone's-throw from Fort\r\nNecessity, in the depths of that lonely wilderness; and there, before\r\nthe summer morn had dawned, they buried him. In the absence of the\r\nchaplain, the funeral service was read by Washington, in a low and\r\nsolemn voice, by the dim and flickering light of a torch. Fearing lest\r\nthe enemy might be lurking near, and, spying out the spot, commit some\r\noutrage on his remains, they fired not a farewell shot over the grave\r\nof their unfortunate general,--that last tribute of respect to a\r\ndeparted soldier, and one he had himself paid, but a short time\r\nbefore, to a nameless Indian warrior. So there they laid him; and, to\r\nthis day, the great highway leading from Cumberland to Pittsburg goes\r\nby the name of Braddock's Road.\r\n\r\nI would, my dear children, have you dwell on these glimpses of a more\r\nmanly and generous nature that brightened the closing hours of\r\nBraddock's life; because it is but Christian and just that we should\r\nbe willing to honor virtue in whomsoever it may be found. With all his\r\nself-conceit and obstinacy, he had a kindly heart, and was a brave\r\nman; and had it been his lot to deal with a civilized enemy, instead\r\nof a savage one, he would, no doubt, have proved himself a skilful\r\ngeneral. And we should not deal too harshly with the memory of a man,\r\nwhose faults, however great they may have been, were more than atoned\r\nfor by the inglorious death he died, and by \"a name ever coupled with\r\ndefeat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, again, Uncle Juvinell paused in his story, and looked beamingly\r\naround on his little auditors. They were all sitting with their eyes\r\nbent earnestly on the burning logs, thinking deeply, no doubt, and\r\nlooking as sober as tombstones in the light of a spring morning.\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden, Willie leaped from his chair, and gave a shrill\r\nIndian war-whoop, that threw the whole bevy into a terrible panic;\r\nmaking some of the smaller fry scream outright, and even Uncle\r\nJuvinell to blink a little. \"There,\" said the youngster, \"is something\r\nto ring in your ears for weeks hereafter, and never to be forgotten\r\neven to your dying day. I heard it the other night at the Indian\r\ncircus, and have been practising it myself ever since. I fancy it must\r\nbe a pretty fair sample of the genuine thing, or it wouldn't have\r\nscared you all up as it did.\" Whereupon Uncle Juvinell, frowning over\r\nhis spectacles with his brows, and laughing behind them with his eyes,\r\nbade the young blood to pack himself into his chair again, and be\r\ncivil; at the same time threatening to put him on a water-gruel diet,\r\nto bring his surplus spirits within reasonable bounds. Then all the\r\nlittle folks laughed, not so much at what their uncle had said, as to\r\nmake believe they had not been frightened in the least; in which\r\nWillie, the cunning rogue, joined, that, under cover of the general\r\nmerriment, he might snicker a little to himself at his own smartness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear children,\" continued the good man, \"hand me the\r\nnotes you have written down, that I may see what it is you would have\r\nme explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"In five minutes' time after you began,\" said rattle-brained Willie,\r\n\"I became so much interested in the story, that I quite forgot all\r\nabout the notes, till it was too late to begin; but I was thinking all\r\nalong, that I should like to understand more clearly the difference\r\nbetween a province and a colony, and\"--\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, uncle,\" broke in Dannie, \"you made every thing so clear and\r\nplain as you went along, that I, for one, didn't feel the need of\r\nwriting down a single note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Dannie,\" said his uncle, \"that being the case, you can perhaps\r\nenlighten your cousin Willie as to the difference between a colony and\r\na province.\"\r\n\r\nHad his uncle called upon him to give the difference between Gog and\r\nMagog, Daniel would have made the venture. So he promptly answered,--\r\n\r\n\"A province is a country, and a colony is the people of it.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Juvinell would have laughed outright at this answer; but he knew\r\nit would mortify the young historian: so he only smiled, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"That will do pretty well, Dannie, as far as it goes; but it does not\r\ncover more than an acre of the ground. Now, a colony, you must know,\r\nWillie, is a settlement made by a country--called, in such cases, the\r\nmother-country--in some foreign region at a distance from it, but\r\nbelonging to it; as, for example, the English colonies in America,\r\nwhich are separated from the mother-country, England, by the great\r\nAtlantic Ocean. A province, on the other hand, is a similar extent of\r\nforeign territory, belonging to a nation or a kingdom, either by\r\nconquest or purchase or settlement; and it may also be a division or\r\ndistrict of the kingdom or nation itself. Thus, you see, a foreign\r\nregion, settled and owned by the mother-country, may, with nearly\r\nequal propriety, be called either a colony or a province; while one\r\nthat belongs to a nation or a kingdom by conquest or purchase is a\r\nprovince, and nothing else. Thus, for example, Canada is a province of\r\nGreat Britain, won from the French by conquest, as you will learn\r\nto-morrow evening. From this you may see, that although a province\r\nmay, yet a colony can no more exist within the boundaries of a\r\nmother-country, than can a man live at home and abroad at one and the\r\nsame time.\"\r\n\r\nThe other children were then called on to produce their notes. Laura\r\nsaid, that, after she had written two or three, she found she was\r\nlosing more than she was gaining; for, when she stopped to take down\r\nany item she wished to remember, she did not hear what came right\r\nafter. Ellen chimed in with the same; and Ned said he was not yet out\r\nof his pot-hooks, and couldn't write; but that he was thinking all the\r\ntime of getting Willie or Dannie to tell him all about it after they\r\nwent to bed. So, what with this excuse, and that, and the other, not a\r\nsingle note was forthcoming, except a few that Master Charlie, the\r\nknowing young gentleman, had written on a very large slate, in letters\r\nquite of his own inventing, which he now laid before his uncle. To set\r\noff his penmanship to the best advantage, and couple the ornamental\r\nwith the useful, he had drawn just above it a picture of Gen.\r\nBraddock, mounted on his dashing white charger, and waving aloft a\r\nsword of monstrous length. One unacquainted with the subject, however,\r\nwould sooner have taken it for a big baboon, geared up in a cocked hat\r\nand high military boots, with a mowing-scythe in his hand, and\r\nastraddle of a rearing donkey heavily coated with feathers instead of\r\nhair. The old gentleman's spectacles seemed to twinkle as he ran his\r\neye over the slate; and after making out two or three rather\r\nsavage-looking _s_'s, as many long-legged _p_'s, a squat _h_ or two, a\r\nbig bottle-bellied _b_, three or four gigantic _l_'s, a broken-backed\r\n_k_ or two, a high-shouldered _w_, a heavy-bottomed _d_, and a long\r\nslim-tailed _y_, it struck him, at length, that speech-belt, Long\r\nKnife, knapsack, Silver Heels, wigwam, and powder-monkey, were the\r\nitems concerning which Master Charlie desired further enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\"For information touching these matters, my dear Charles,\" then said\r\nUncle Juvinell, \"I will pass you over to Willie and Dannie, who, I\r\ndare say, are quite as well posted up in matters of this kind, as your\r\nold uncle; for, if I mistake not, they have just been reading Catlin's\r\nbook on the Indians, and Gulliver's Travels in Brobdignag.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it,\" inquired Ellen, \"that Washington, being the good man that\r\nhe was, could have taken part in that wicked war between the French\r\nand English about a country that didn't belong to either of them, but\r\nto the poor Indians?\"\r\n\r\nNow, although Uncle Juvinell was satisfied in his own mind that\r\nWashington's conduct in this matter was just what it should have been,\r\nyet, for all that, he was a little puzzled how to answer this question\r\nin a way that the little folks would rightly understand.\r\n\r\n\"This very thing, my dear niece,\" replied he after a moment's pause,\r\n\"grieved and troubled his mind a great deal, as you may well believe:\r\nbut he knew, that, if the English did not get possession of this land,\r\nthe French would; and this, by increasing the strength of the enemy,\r\nwould by and by endanger the safety of his own native land, and even\r\nthe lives and liberties of his countrymen. And he also knew that it\r\nwould be far better for the spread of useful knowledge and the true\r\nreligion, that all this rich country should be in the hands of some\r\nChristian people, who would make it a place fit to live in, and to be\r\npeaceful and prosperous and happy in, than that it should be left\r\nentirely to those barbarous savages, who only made of it a place to\r\nhunt and to fish in, to fight and scalp, and to burn and torture each\r\nother like devils in. Besides this, it is the duty of every true\r\npatriot (and no one knew this better than he) to serve and defend the\r\ncountry, under the protection of whose laws he has lived in peace and\r\nplenty, against all her enemies, whether at home or abroad, even\r\nshould she now and then be a little in the wrong; for, by so doing, he\r\ndefends his own home and family, rights and liberty,--objects that\r\nshould be as dear to him as life itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"O uncle!\" exclaimed Ned with a start, as if he had just caught a\r\npassing recollection by the tail as it was about skedaddling round the\r\ncorner, \"tell me, will you? what kind of a life a charmed life is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really Ned,\" cried Uncle Juvinell, \"I am very glad that you mentioned\r\nit; for it puts me in mind of something I should have told you before,\r\nand which I might else have forgotten. This, however, is as good a\r\ntime as any; and, when you hear what I am now going to tell you, you\r\nwill readily understand, without further explanation, what is meant\r\nwhen it is said of a man that he bears a charmed life about him. To do\r\nthis, I must anticipate a little, or, to speak more clearly, take time\r\nby the forelock, and, going forward a little in our story, tell you of\r\na circumstance which your Uncle Juvinell, when a boy, often heard\r\nrelated by Dr. Craik, who was then an aged and venerable man.\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen years after poor Braddock had been laid in his unhonored\r\ngrave, Col. Washington, taking with him his friend Dr. Craik, went on\r\nan exploring expedition to the Ohio, in behalf of the brave soldiers\r\nwho had served under him at the Great Meadows, and to whom, it must be\r\nremembered, Gov. Dinwiddie had promised two hundred thousand acres of\r\nthe best land to be found on this great river or its branches. There\r\nwas peace then along the border, and little or no danger was to be\r\napprehended from the Indians. They travelled in a large canoe, rowed\r\nby two or three hunters; and what with fishing in the streams (for\r\nthey took with them their fishing tackle), what with hunting in the\r\nwoods (for they took with them their hunting rifles), what with\r\ncamping on the green shore at night (for they took with them their\r\ncamp utensils), and what with the comfortable thought that there was\r\nnot an Indian warrior within a hundred miles whose fingers were\r\nitching for their scalps (for they took with them this and many other\r\npleasant thoughts besides), they had, you may depend upon it, a\r\nglorious time.\r\n\r\n\"One day, there came to their camp, at the mouth of the Great Kanawha,\r\na party of Indians, headed by an old chief of grave and venerable\r\naspect, who approached Washington with deep reverence, as if entering\r\nthe presence of some superior being. After several pipes of tobacco\r\nhad been smoked, and several haunches of venison had been eaten,--the\r\nfirst to show that they had come friendly, the last to show that they\r\ncame hungry,--the old chief addressed Washington in a speech, which\r\nyour Uncle Juvinell cannot repeat to you word for word as he heard it\r\nfrom the lips of the worthy old doctor; but he well remembers the\r\nsubstance thereof, and will give it you as nearly as he can in the\r\nIndian style of oratory.\r\n\r\n     \"'They came and told me,' began the old chief, 'that the great\r\n     Long Knife was in our country; and I was very glad. I said to\r\n     them, though I be old and feeble, though the way be long, and\r\n     the hills many and high, and the rivers many and wide, yet must\r\n     I go and see him once more before I die; for it is the young\r\n     warrior, whom, years ago, I saw shielded from our bullets by\r\n     the hand of the Great Spirit. Let the pale-faces hear my words.\r\n     Fifteen summers ago, when the woods and thickets were dense and\r\n     green, the French and Indians went out to lay in ambuscade for\r\n     the big English general, among the Monongahela hills. I took my\r\n     warriors, and went along, and we lay in wait together. The\r\n     English were many and strong; we were few and weak: thus we had\r\n     no thought of victory in our minds, but only to give our\r\n     enemies a little trouble, and keep them back a while till the\r\n     big French army came down from the Great Lakes. We saw the\r\n     English army cross the river and come up the hill; yet they\r\n     suspected not. We saw them walk into our snare, up to the very\r\n     muzzles of our guns; nor did they dream of danger, till our\r\n     war-whoop went up, and our bullets began to fly as fast as\r\n     winter hail. I saw the red-coats fall, and strew the ground\r\n     like the red leaves of the woods nipped by an untimely frost,\r\n     and smitten by the unseen hands of a mighty wind. The snows of\r\n     eighty winters have fallen upon my head. I have been in many a\r\n     bloody battle; yet never saw I the red life-stream run as it\r\n     that day ran down Braddock's Hill from English hearts. Listen!\r\n     I saw that day, among the English, a young warrior who was not\r\n     an Englishman. I singled him out as a mark for my rifle; for he\r\n     was tall and strong, and rode grandly, and his presence there\r\n     was a danger to us. Seventeen times did I take slow and steady\r\n     aim, and fire; but my bullets went astray, and found him not.\r\n     Then I pointed him out to my young men, whose eyes were sharper\r\n     and whose hands were steadier than mine, and bade them bring\r\n     him down. It was all in vain: their bullets glanced from him as\r\n     if he had been a rock. I saw two horses fall under him, shot\r\n     dead; yet he rose unhurt. Then did I lay my hand on my mouth in\r\n     wonder, and bade my young men turn their rifles another way;\r\n     for the Great Spirit, I knew, held that young warrior in his\r\n     keeping, and that his anger would be kindled against us if we\r\n     desisted not. That young warrior, the favorite of Heaven, the\r\n     man who is destined never to fall in battle, now stands before\r\n     me. Once more mine eyes have seen him, and I shall now go away\r\n     content.'\r\n\r\n\"And now, Ned, my boy,\" said Uncle Juvinell, after he had ended this\r\noration, \"can you tell me what a charmed life is?\"\r\n\r\n\"One that is bullet-proof, I suppose,\" replied Ned.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say that Washington was bullet-proof, do you, Uncle\r\nJuve?\" put in doubting Charlie.\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly that, my little nephew,\" replied his Uncle Juvinell;\r\n\"and yet a great deal more: for, beyond all doubt, an all-wise\r\nProvidence raised up George Washington to do the good and great work\r\nthat he did, and to this end shielded him when encompassed by the\r\nperils of battle, strengthened him when beset by the wiles of\r\ntemptation, and cheered him when visited by the trials of adversity.\r\nDr. Davis, a famous preacher of that day, seemed to have looked upon\r\nhim, as did the old Indian, as one favored of Heaven; for, in a sermon\r\npreached by him a few weeks after Braddock's defeat, he spoke of Col.\r\nWashington as 'that heroic youth, whom, he could not but hope,\r\nProvidence had preserved in so signal a manner for some important\r\nservice to his country.' And now, my little folks, the clock strikes\r\nnine, and our Christmas logs burn low: so join your old uncle in an\r\nevening hymn; then haste you to your happy beds to sleep and dream the\r\npeaceful night away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nWORK IN EARNEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly had the last clod been thrown on poor Braddock's grave, when\r\nhis army was seized with a second and most unaccountable panic; for no\r\none could tell from whence or how it came. With those horrid yells\r\nstill sounding in their ears, and those ghastly sights of blood and\r\ncarnage still fresh in their memories, they fancied they heard, in\r\nevery passing gust that stirred the dead leaves, warning whispers of\r\nthe stealthy approach of the dreaded enemy, and that in every waving\r\nthicket he might be lurking for them in ambush.\r\n\r\nCol. Dunbar, as next in rank, had, for the time being, taken command\r\nof the troops; but, cowardly as the old general was rash, he shared in\r\nthe general panic, and could do nothing to re-assure his men or give\r\nthem a little confidence. So, without waiting to know by whose orders,\r\nor if by any at all, they fell to, and destroyed all the heavy\r\nbaggage, baggage-wagons, and artillery; every thing, in fact, that\r\ncould hinder them in their retreat. Thus disencumbered, they set out\r\nin hot haste; and after a hurried and disorderly march, or rather\r\nflight, they reached Fort Cumberland.\r\n\r\nHere Col. Washington, who had taken no part whatever in the\r\nunsoldierly proceedings just mentioned, stopped a few days to recruit\r\na little after the severe fatigues he had, for a week past, been\r\ncalled upon to undergo, while still too much enfeebled from his\r\nten-days' fever. The first use he made of this breathing spell was to\r\nwrite an affectionate letter to his much-honored mother to ease her\r\nmind of the anxiety he knew she would be feeling on his account, when\r\nrumors of the late disaster should reach her ears. He told her of his\r\nalmost miraculous deliverance from a cruel and bloody death, in\r\nlanguage full of gratitude to the God of battles, who had shielded him\r\nin so signal a manner, when his brave comrades were falling by\r\nhundreds around him. Writing to his brother Augustine at the same\r\ntime, he wittily says, \"Since my arrival at this place, I have heard a\r\ncircumstantial account of my death and dying speech; and I take this\r\nearly opportunity of contradicting the former, and assuring you that I\r\nhave not yet composed the latter.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had so far regained his strength as to enable him to travel,\r\nhe betook himself once more to the peaceful shades of Mount Vernon. He\r\nre-entered at once upon his duties as Adjutant-General of the Northern\r\nDistrict,--a post he still continued to hold, although his connection\r\nwith the regular army had ceased with the death of Braddock.\r\n\r\nBut we must return for a few moments to Fort Cumberland, where we left\r\nthe valorous Col. Dunbar quite out of breath from the uncommonly brisk\r\nspeed, which seems to have been his habit now and then, of getting\r\nover very rough and hilly roads. Any soldier, with a spark of manly\r\nspirit under his sword-belt, would have made a resolute stand at a\r\nplace of so much importance, and held it to the death, rather than\r\nleft the defenceless inhabitants exposed to the horrors of a border\r\nwar. Col. Dunbar was not, by any means, the true soldier just hinted\r\nat; and consequently did no such thing. Seeing that the sick and\r\nwounded were but so many clogs to rapid and easy motion, he resolved\r\nto leave them behind under the care of the slender garrison he had\r\nplaced in the fort, who were expected to defend it against an enemy\r\nthat he, with a force of fifteen hundred strong, had not the courage\r\nto face. Thus rid of his hinderances to the last degree of\r\nlightsomeness, he pushed on by forced marches, as if a legion of\r\npainted savages were yelling at his heels; and never slackened speed\r\nuntil he found himself safe within the friendly walls of Philadelphia,\r\nwhere he went into comfortable winter-quarters while yet the dog-days\r\nwere at their hottest.\r\n\r\nThus basely deserted by these doughty regulars, who had been sent\r\nover so many thousand miles of salt water for their protection,\r\nthe colonists saw with dismay the whole line of their vast frontier,\r\nfrom Lake Ontario to the Carolinas, open to the inroads of the\r\nFrench and their Indian allies. In the long-run, however (as you\r\nshall see hereafter), two luckier mishaps than Braddock's defeat\r\nand Dunbar's retreat, that seemed at the time so fraught with evil,\r\ncould not have befallen them. They were thereby taught two wholesome\r\nlessons, which they might otherwise have been a long time in learning,\r\nand without which they never could have gained their independence\r\nand made themselves a nation. The first, by proving that British\r\nregulars were not, by any means, the never-to-be-beaten, and the\r\nnever-to-be-made-to-skedaddle warriors that they boasted themselves to\r\nbe, and that one-half of the Americans were foolish enough to believe\r\nthem to be. Thus, when the War of Independence broke out, our\r\nRevolutionary fathers remembered this, and were not afraid to meet the\r\nEnglish even on such unequal terms. The second, by opening their eyes\r\nto the fact, that, as they (the colonists) could no longer look to the\r\nmother-country for protection, they must henceforward rely upon their\r\nown strength and resources for their defence and safety.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia, seeing the forlorn condition of things, were\r\nat last awakened to a full sense of the danger that threatened, not\r\nonly their back settlements, but even the heart of the Old Dominion\r\nitself. They therefore began to bestir themselves in right good\r\nearnest to put the province in a better posture of defence; and, to\r\nthis end, resolved to send more troops into the field, raise more\r\nmoney, procure new arms and fresh supplies of military stores, and\r\nerect a chain of twenty block-houses, or small forts, stretching along\r\nthe whole line of their frontier, from Pennsylvania to North\r\nCarolina,--a distance of three hundred and sixty miles. Washington's\r\ncareer as a soldier had not, up to this time, been marked by any of\r\nthose daring and brilliant exploits that charm and dazzle vulgar\r\nminds; but had, on the contrary, been one unbroken train of\r\nmisfortunes and disasters. Notwithstanding this, however, the\r\nconfidence his countrymen had placed in his prudence, courage,\r\nability, and patriotism, so far from having been diminished thereby,\r\nhad gone on steadily gaining strength from the very beginning. They\r\nwell knew, that, had the headstrong and unlucky Braddock given heed to\r\nhis prudent and timely counsel, the late campaign could never have\r\nended in the disgraceful and disastrous manner that it had. As the\r\nmost flattering proof of their esteem and confidence, they now turned\r\nto him in their hour of peril, and, although he was not yet\r\ntwenty-four years of age, called upon him, as with one voice, to take\r\nthe chief command of all the forces of the province. After some\r\ndeliberation, being persuaded that it was really their earnest desire,\r\nhe modestly accepted the appointment, on condition that certain\r\nchanges should be made in the military, and that he should be allowed\r\nto choose his field-officers. This was readily agreed to by the\r\nVirginia House of Burgesses; who, in addition, voted him fifteen\r\nhundred dollars by way of compensating him for the many losses he had\r\nsuffered, in horses, baggage, and money since the beginning of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, early in the autumn, he took up his headquarters at the\r\nfrontier town of Winchester, beyond the Blue Ridge, in the beautiful\r\nValley of the Shenandoah. As four great highways met here from as many\r\ndifferent quarters of the country, it was a post of much importance;\r\nand he resolved, by strongly fortifying it, to make it the\r\nrallying-point of all the border. His men were all raw recruits, just\r\ntaken from the plough or forge or carpenter's bench, as the case might\r\nbe; and, to render them fit for the peculiar service in which they\r\nwere to be employed, it became his duty, besides training them in the\r\nregular military exercises, to instruct them in the arts and\r\nstratagems of Indian warfare, or bush-fighting, as it is more aptly\r\ncalled. Long, however, before he was ready to take the field, the\r\nFrench and Indians, made daring and audacious by their great victory\r\non the Monongahela, had crossed the mountains at several different\r\npoints in great numbers, and had already begun their bloody work. The\r\nterrified and defenceless inhabitants dwelling in the distant parts of\r\nthe wilderness now came flocking to the Shenandoah Valley for\r\nprotection from the merciless enemy, some of them never stopping till\r\nthey had passed on over to the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nOne morning, a rumor found its way to Winchester, that a large party\r\nof Indians were within twelve miles of that place, pillaging, burning,\r\nand murdering at a frightful rate. Straightway a great fear fell upon\r\nthe inhabitants. Little children ran, and hid their faces in their\r\nmothers' aprons, crying piteously; women ran hither and thither,\r\nscreaming, and wringing their hands; and broad-shouldered,\r\ndouble-fisted men stood stock-still, and shook in their moccasins.\r\nWashington tried to prevail upon some of his soldiers to sally out\r\nwith him, and drive the enemy back from the valley; but, being\r\nstrangers to military obedience, not a leather-shirt of all the rabble\r\ncould he get to venture beyond the ditches. When he put them in mind\r\nof what was expected of them as men and soldiers, they only answered,\r\nthat, if they must die, they would rather stay there, and die with\r\ntheir wives and families. Having a lurking suspicion, that, after all,\r\nthere might be more smoke than fire in these flying rumors, he sent\r\nout a scout to bring him some more certain tidings of the matter. In a\r\nwonderfully short time, the scout came back, pale and affrighted, with\r\nthe dismal intelligence that he had, with his own ears, heard the guns\r\nand yells of the Indians not four miles distant, and that Winchester\r\nwould be beset by the savages in less than an hour. Whereupon\r\nWashington made another appeal to the courage and manhood of his men;\r\nwhich proved so far successful, that a forlorn hope of forty finally\r\nscrewed up pluck enough to follow him to the scene of danger. Moving\r\nwith great caution and circumspection, and keeping all their ears and\r\neyes about them, the party came at length to the spot mentioned by the\r\nscout; where, sure enough, they heard a somewhat scattering discharge\r\nof fire-arms, and divers outlandish noises, that bore, however, but a\r\nvery slight resemblance to the terrific yells and whoops of Indian\r\nwarriors. Advancing a few paces farther, a sudden turn of the road\r\nbrought them in sight of two drunken soldiers, who were cursing and\r\nswearing and hallooing in a manner quite outrageous and immoral; and\r\nnow and then, by way of adding a little spice to this part of their\r\nentertainment, firing off their pistols into the tree-tops. And this\r\nit was that had given rise to those wild rumors that had thrown the\r\nwhole country into such a terrible panic. To this imprudent waste of\r\nbreath and ammunition, the latter of which they had but little enough\r\nto spare, Washington put a rather sudden stop by ordering the lively\r\nyoung blades to be seized, and carried as prisoners to Winchester,\r\nwhere he kept them in severe confinement for more than a week after\r\nthey had regained their sober senses. All this was ludicrous enough;\r\nand you may be sure that Washington, although grave and dignified\r\nbeyond his years, had a hearty laugh over it the first time he found\r\nhimself alone with one or two of his brother-officers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other cares, the duties of his office required him\r\nto visit, from time to time, the several forts along the frontier, to\r\nsee that those already finished were kept in fighting order, and give\r\ndirections for the proper construction of those still under way. Now,\r\nthe little garrison of forty men, that Col. Dunbar had left to hold\r\nand defend Fort Cumberland against the combined armies of the French\r\nand Indians, was commanded by a certain Dagworthy, who, pluming\r\nhimself upon the king's commission as captain, refused to own the\r\nauthority and render obedience to the orders of Washington, who held\r\nonly a governor's commission as colonel. It will be remembered, that\r\nWashington had a similar misunderstanding with Capt. Mackay, eighteen\r\nmonths before, at the Great Meadows, touching this same question of\r\nrank between royal and provincial officers, which had caused him great\r\ntrouble and annoyance. Matters had now come to such a pass, that a\r\nlittle upstart captain of forty men could set at naught the authority\r\nof the commander-in-chief of the forces of a whole province, merely\r\nbecause he could boast a bit of paper embellished with the king's\r\nname. This was a degradation too grievous to be longer borne by a\r\nmanly, independent spirit. Though sorely vexed and annoyed, Washington\r\nhad too much self-respect and prudence to make a noise about the\r\nmatter; but he inwardly resolved, that, as soon as the coming-on of\r\nwinter would oblige the Indians to recross the mountains to the\r\nshelter of their homes beyond, he would take advantage of the\r\nbreathing spell thus allowed him to make a journey to Boston, there to\r\nsubmit the question for final settlement to Gen. Shirley, who had\r\nsucceeded Braddock to the chief command of all the British forces in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the departure of the Indians brought the distressed\r\ninhabitants of the border the prospect of a few months' peace and\r\nquiet, he departed for Boston, in company with two of his\r\nbrother-officers, Capts. Stewart and Mercer.\r\n\r\nNow, in those days, a journey from the Old Dominion to the Bay City, a\r\ndistance of but five hundred miles, in the depth of winter, when the\r\nroads were either deep and stiff with mire, or rough and knobby with\r\nfrost, was really a greater undertaking than a voyage in a steamship\r\nfrom Boston to Constantinople would now be considered. Our young men\r\ntravelled on horseback, as was the fashion of the day; and took with\r\nthem their negro servants, who, riding behind with their masters'\r\nsaddle-bags and portmanteaus, and dressed in fine livery, with gold\r\nlace on their fur hats, and blue cloaks, gave quite an air of style\r\nand consequence to the little cavalcade.\r\n\r\nWashington's fame had long since gone before him, as was proved by the\r\nmarked distinction and respect with which he was treated at\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and other places along the route. All were\r\neager to behold with their own eyes the youthful hero, whose gallant\r\nconduct and wonderful escape at the defeat of Braddock had been so\r\nnoised throughout the Colonies; and when we add to this his tall and\r\ncommanding form, the manly beauty of his face, his dignified bearing,\r\nhis rich and handsome dress, and the unequalled skill with which he\r\nmanaged his large and noble horse, we cannot wonder at the interest\r\nand admiration his appearance awakened in the minds of all who saw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to Boston, where he likewise met with a flattering\r\nreception, he lost no time in making known to Gen. Shirley the\r\nbusiness that had taken him thither. The justness and reasonableness\r\nof his complaints were promptly acknowledged by this officer, who, to\r\nplace the vexed question beyond dispute, declared, that henceforward\r\nCapt. Dagworthy and all inferior officers, holding king's commissions,\r\nshould own the authority and render obedience to the orders of all\r\nprovincial officers of superior rank. This, the main object of his\r\njourney, thus happily disposed of, Col. Washington set out on his\r\nreturn to Virginia: but, knowing that the Indian war-whoop was not\r\nlikely soon to be heard in the Shenandoah Valley, he indulged himself\r\nso far as to tarry two whole weeks at New-York City; and for the best\r\nof reasons, as I will tell you.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Boston, he had met here with the beautiful and\r\naccomplished Miss Phillipps, with whom he was vastly pleased; and it\r\nwas for the nearer study of this young lady's charms, and further\r\ncultivation of her acquaintance, that our young Virginia colonel was\r\nnow tempted for once in his life thus to linger on his way. Nothing\r\ncame of it, however, that anybody now can tell; although the lady, you\r\nmay stake your heads upon it, must and ought to have been highly\r\nflattered at being thus singled out by the young hero whose name and\r\npraise were in everybody's mouth. Perhaps his admiration never ripened\r\ninto love; and, if it did, his modesty, as in the case of the Lowland\r\nBeauty, must have hindered him from making known his partiality.\r\nWhatever it may have been, it is, at this late day, of little\r\nconsequence; for long before that year had passed away, with all its\r\nanxious cares, its perils and privations, and with all its train of\r\nghastly Indian horrors, these tender sentiments had become to him\r\nnothing more than pleasant memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nDARK DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt were long to tell you, my dear children, all that happened to\r\nWashington, and all that he did for the next two or three years of his\r\nlife. I shall, therefore, in as brief and clear a manner as may be,\r\npresent to your minds a picture simply of those scenes in which he\r\nfigured as the chief actor; although there were, it must be\r\nremembered, others who played a far more important part in this old\r\nFrench War than our young Virginia colonel.\r\n\r\nThe French and Indians, early in the spring of these years, were wont\r\nto cross the mountains at different points, and for months together\r\nfollow their usual programme of fire, plunder, and massacre, till the\r\napproach of winter, when, loaded with booty and scalps, they would go\r\nas they had come, only to return on the opening of the following\r\nspring. With these cruel savages, and their scarcely less cruel white\r\nallies, neither age nor sex found mercy; old men, tender women, and\r\nhelpless children, alike falling victims to their murderous tomahawks\r\nand scalping-knives. Farms were laid waste, crops destroyed, cattle\r\nbutchered; and often, for days and nights together, the smoke could be\r\nseen in many directions at once, as it rose from burning barns and\r\ndwellings, and hung like a pall over the ill-fated land. At last, so\r\ngreat became the audacity of these pestilent savages, that they\r\ncarried their depredations within cannon range of the very walls of\r\nWinchester; and, under their destroying hand, the rich and beautiful\r\nValley of the Shenandoah seemed likely soon again to become a waste\r\nand desert place. It was a boast of theirs, that they could take any\r\nfort that could be fired; and round these places of refuge they would\r\nskulk and lurk with the greatest patience for a week at a time, quite\r\ncontent could they but get a single shot at such of the garrison as\r\ndared to show themselves beyond shelter of the walls. Sometimes,\r\nsuddenly darting from their hiding-place, they would pounce upon\r\nlittle children playing in the woods, and, in full view of the fort,\r\nbear them away captives, never more to be seen by their bereaved\r\nparents, who could only listen in helpless anguish to the piteous\r\ncries of their little innocents, that grew fainter and fainter as\r\ntheir savage captors hurried them farther and farther into the gloomy\r\ndepths of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nOften, in their excursions along the frontier, Washington and his men\r\nwould come upon the still smoking ruins of a happy home, or the hacked\r\nand mangled body of an unfortunate traveller who had been waylaid and\r\nmurdered by the Indians in some lonely mountain glen. In after-life,\r\nthe recollection of these harrowing scenes was to Washington so\r\npainful, that he could but seldom be brought to speak of them. Now and\r\nthen, however, he would relate to a few friends some of these dark\r\nexperiences; among which is the following, given in his own words, as\r\na fair example of all the rest:--\r\n\r\n     \"One day,\" said he, \"as we were traversing a part of the\r\n     frontier, we came upon a small log-house, standing in the\r\n     centre of a little clearing, surrounded by woods on all sides.\r\n     As we approached, we heard the report of a gun,--the usual\r\n     signal of coming horror. Our party crept cautiously through the\r\n     underwood, until we had approached near enough to see what we\r\n     had already foreboded. A smoke was slowly making its way\r\n     through the roof of the house; when, at the same time, a party\r\n     of Indians came forth, laden with plunder,--consisting of\r\n     clothes, household furniture, domestic utensils, and dripping\r\n     scalps. We fired, and killed all but one, who tried to get\r\n     away, but was soon overtaken and shot down. Upon entering the\r\n     hut, there met us a sight, which, though we were familiar with\r\n     scenes of blood and massacre, struck us--at least myself--with\r\n     feelings more mournful than I had ever experienced before. On a\r\n     bed, in one corner of the room, lay the body of a young woman,\r\n     swimming in blood, with a gash in the forehead that almost\r\n     separated the head into two parts. On her breast lay two little\r\n     babes, less than a twelvemonth old, also with their heads cut\r\n     open; their innocent blood, that had once flowed in one common\r\n     vein, now mingling in the same current again. I was inured to\r\n     scenes of bloodshed and misery; but this cut me to the heart;\r\n     and never in my after-life did I raise my arm against a savage,\r\n     without calling to mind the mother and her little twins with\r\n     their heads cleft asunder. On examining the tracks of the\r\n     Indians to see what other murders they might have committed, we\r\n     found a little boy, and, a few steps forward, his father, both\r\n     scalped, and both stone-dead. From the prints of the boy's\r\n     feet, it seemed that he had been following the plough with his\r\n     father, whom he had probably seen shot down; and, in attempting\r\n     to escape, had been pursued, overtaken, and murdered. The ruin\r\n     was complete: not one of the family had been spared. Such was\r\n     the character of this miserable warfare. The wretched people of\r\n     the frontier never went to rest without bidding each other\r\n     farewell; for the chances were they might never wake again, or\r\n     wake only to find their last sleep. When leaving one spot for\r\n     the purpose of giving protection to another point of exposure,\r\n     the scene was often such as I shall never forget. The women and\r\n     children would cling around our knees, and mothers would hold\r\n     up their little babes before our eyes, begging us to stay and\r\n     protect them, and, for God's sake, not leave them to be\r\n     butchered by the savages. A hundred times, I declare to Heaven,\r\n     I would have laid down my life with pleasure under the tomahawk\r\n     and scalping-knife, could I, by the sacrifice, have insured the\r\n     safety of these suffering people.\"\r\n\r\nThe little folks can well imagine how scenes like these must have\r\npained and wrung a heart like Washington's. But what could he do? His\r\nwhole force did not exceed one thousand fighting men; with which he\r\nhad to man more than twenty forts, and guard a frontier of nearly four\r\nhundred miles' extent. In addition to this, his men had been so\r\nscattered all the while at these different points, as to have placed\r\nit altogether beyond his power to give that attention to their\r\nmilitary training which he had had so near at heart when he first\r\nentered upon his command. It naturally followed, then, that there was\r\namong the greater number an almost total want of order and discipline.\r\nThey came and went when and where it suited their humor best; were\r\nimpatient of control; wasted their ammunition, of which there was a\r\ngreat scarcity, in target-shooting; were far more ready to trouble\r\ntheir officers with good advice than aid them by prompt obedience to\r\norders; and, if their sagacious counsels went unheeded, they would,\r\nwithout more ado, shoulder their rifles in high dudgeon, and tramp\r\nhome. And, withal, so tender were they of what they were pleased to\r\ncall their _honor_, that they would take it as quite an insult to be\r\nput on soldiers' rations; and were too proud or lazy--which with them\r\nwas the same thing--to carry their own provisions while on the march;\r\nchoosing, rather, to risk what chance might bring them, in the shape\r\nof bullocks, sheep, or pigs, which they would knock down, without a\r\n\"By your leave\" to the owner, and, after eating as much as satisfied\r\ntheir present hunger, would throw the rest away. Thus, between their\r\nwasteful defenders and their wasting invaders, the poor distressed\r\ninhabitants were brought to the verge of starvation.\r\n\r\nThe forts were too far apart to prevent the Indians from passing\r\nbetween; and the garrisons were too weak to lend each other aid when\r\nany of them chanced to be in hard, besetting need. This plan of giving\r\ndefence to the border had been strongly opposed by Washington, who\r\nforesaw the disadvantages just hinted at, and had urged the exact\r\ncontrary. This was, instead of having so many small forts, with but a\r\nhandful of men in each, to fortify Winchester in the completest manner\r\npossible, with a view of making it the only stronghold and\r\nrallying-point of all the border, and to be manned by the main body of\r\nthe troops, who were to give support to the smaller parties in their\r\nexcursions against the enemy. Long before the war was ended, it was\r\nclearly to be seen, that, had this plan been adopted, much useless\r\nexpenditure of money and shedding of blood would have been avoided. As\r\nit was, the cunning and watchful foe, whose motions were swift as the\r\nbirds, and secret as death, could pass between these forts, not only\r\nunopposed, but even unobserved, and, without let or hinderance, lay\r\nwaste the country for the protection of which they had been built.\r\nUnder this most melancholy state of things, all the region west of the\r\nBlue Ridge was fast becoming the dreary and silent wilderness it had\r\nbeen in days gone by. Scarcely a shadow of its former population was\r\nleft: some had fled to the forts for refuge; some had resettled in the\r\neastern parts of the province; some had been carried away into cruel\r\ncaptivity; and many, very many, had met with a horrible death at the\r\nhands of the merciless invaders.\r\n\r\nAs if all this we have just related were not enough to try the\r\npatience and fortitude of young Washington, evil reports, injurious to\r\nhis character, and charging him with being the author of all these\r\nfailures and calamities, were set agoing by secret enemies at home.\r\nForemost among these, you will be surprised and sorry to learn, was\r\nGov. Dinwiddie, who had for some time past regarded with a jealous and\r\nenvious eye this rising hope of the land, and was now seeking, by a\r\nvariety of underhand means, to have him disgraced from the service,\r\nthat Col. Innez, a particular chum of his, might be advanced to the\r\nchief command of the Virginia troops instead. The lower offices of the\r\narmy he was zealous to bestow upon a knot of needy adventurers, who,\r\nbeing Scotchmen like himself, were in high favor with him, and\r\nscrupled not to make his likes and dislikes their own, if, by so\r\ndoing, they could further their own private advantage. Perhaps Gov.\r\nDinwiddie himself may not have been the direct author of these\r\nreports; but it is quite certain that his hungry hangers-on would\r\nnever have dared whisper them had they not been fully aware of the\r\nill-will he bore the person by whose injury they hoped to profit, and\r\nthat they had but to do the thing, when their patron would not only\r\nwink at it, but even give it his secret approval.\r\n\r\nWhen these malicious whisperings came to the ears of Washington, he\r\nwas stung to the quick by such unfair and unmerited treatment. Feeling\r\nassured in his own conscience that he had done his whole duty as far\r\nas in him lay, all his strong and manly nature was roused to indignant\r\nanger, that his fair name should thus become the target of these\r\narrows flying in the dark, without an opportunity being allowed him of\r\na fair and open hearing in his own defence. He would have left the\r\nservice at once,--the very end his enemies had been plotting so hard\r\nto bring about,--had not the frontier settlements, just at that\r\nmoment, been threatened with more than usual peril; and to have\r\ndeserted his post at such a time would have given his accusers real\r\ngrounds for the charges, which heretofore had been but a mere\r\npretence. Before the immediate danger was past that kept him at his\r\npost, many of his warmest and most influential friends, residing in\r\ndifferent parts of the province, had written to him, earnestly\r\nentreating him not to think of resigning his command; assuring him, at\r\nthe same time, that the base slanders of those evil-minded men had\r\nfound no place whatever in the minds of his fellow-countrymen. On the\r\ncontrary, beholding the courage, patience, and humanity with which he\r\nwas discharging the high and sacred duties they had intrusted to him,\r\nthey felt their love for him, and confidence in him, increasing every\r\nday. With this gratifying assurance that his conduct and motives were\r\nrightly understood by those whose approbation he was most desirous of\r\nwinning, Washington now held on his course with renewed hope and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThenceforward, Gov. Dinwiddie, as if to revenge himself for this\r\nfailure of his base and selfish design, never let an opportunity slip\r\nof thwarting or annoying the man whose high public character his petty\r\nmalice could not reach, and whose private worth his mean envy could\r\nnot tarnish. His letters to Washington, the tone of which heretofore\r\nhad been uncivil enough, now became harsh and insolent, full of\r\nfault-finding, and bristling all over with biting reproofs and unmanly\r\ninsinuations. Although wretchedly ignorant of military matters, and at\r\na distance from the seat of active operations, yet he must needs take\r\nupon himself the full control of all the troops of the province,\r\nwithout seeming to trouble his mind as to what might be the wishes and\r\nopinions of him who was in fact their true leader. Whether from a\r\nspiteful desire to perplex the object of his dislike, or natural\r\nfickleness of character, every letter from him brought with it some\r\nnew plan. To-day, he ordered this; to-morrow, he ordered that; and,\r\nthe next day, upset the other two by something quite different from\r\neither: so that Washington was often left completely in the dark as\r\nto what the uncertain meddler's wishes or plans really were.\r\n\r\nAt last, from being thus harassed in mind by these petty annoyances,\r\nand worn in body by the hardships of such rough service, his health\r\nfailed him; and he was advised to repair to Mount Vernon, and there\r\nremain until his disease should take a more favorable turn. Here he\r\nlay for four long, weary months, before he could rejoin big regiment;\r\nduring much of which time, his friends, who nursed and watched him,\r\nreally regarded his recovery as doubtful. This is another instance of\r\nwhat so often seems to us a matter of wonder,--the power of a\r\nnarrow-minded, mean-spirited, ill-tempered, false-hearted man to\r\ninflict pain on a noble and lofty nature.\r\n\r\nA short time before the close of the war, it becoming quite certain\r\nthat he had been putting public money, intrusted to his keeping, to\r\nprivate or dishonorable uses, Gov. Dinwiddie was recalled, and another\r\nsent over to fill his place. Being the man here described, and a petty\r\ntyrant withal, nobody was sorry to see him go, except the needy\r\ntoadies who had hung about him, and who, seeing that nothing was\r\nlikely to turn up for them in the New World, packed off to Scotland\r\nwith their patron, as hungry and empty-handed as they came.\r\n\r\nBy the by, I must not forget to tell you of the heroic conduct of old\r\nLord Fairfax. Greenway Court, as you no doubt remember, was in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, not many miles from Winchester; and, situated on\r\nthe very edge of a vast forest, was quite open to the inroads of the\r\nIndians, any one of whom, would have risked limb or life to get his\r\nbloody clutches on the gray scalp of so renowned a Long Knife. To meet\r\nthis danger, as well as do his part towards the general defence, he\r\nmustered his hunters and negro servants, to the number of a hundred or\r\nthereabouts, and formed them at his own expense into a company of\r\nhorse, with which the keen old fox-hunter, now as daring a trooper,\r\nscoured the country from time to time, and did good service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nA NEW ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus these melancholy years came and went, with all their dark and\r\npainful experiences. A firm and self-reliant spirit like Washington's,\r\nhowever, could not be long cast down by even severer trials than those\r\nby which we have just seen his strength and manhood tested: so, from\r\nthat time forward, come what might, he resolved to hold right on, nor\r\nbate a jot of heart or hope or zeal or patience, till the coming-on of\r\nbetter days, when, God willing, he might render a good and faithful\r\naccount of this, his country's trust.\r\n\r\nBut the little folks must not suppose that Col. Washington and Gov.\r\nDinwiddie were by any means the only persons of consequence who\r\nfigured in this Old French War. On the contrary, there were others of\r\nfar more importance at the time than they, not so much from any\r\npeculiar merit of their own, as from the part they played in those\r\nevents; and upon whom, as such, I must needs bestow some passing\r\nnotice, were it but to give to our story greater clearness and\r\ncompleteness. What concerns you to know of them at present I will\r\nbriefly sum up in a few words, and make it as plain to you as a table\r\nof simple addition.\r\n\r\nAs Commander-in-chief of all the British forces in America, Braddock,\r\nas I have told you elsewhere, was succeeded by Gen. Shirley; who,\r\nproving himself unfit for the place, was soon recalled, and Lord\r\nLoudoun sent over from England instead; who, proving himself equally\r\nunfit, was dealt with in the same manner, and Gen. Abercrombie sent\r\nover instead; who also, proving himself incompetent, was also\r\nrecalled, and Gen. Amherst sent over; who, proving a wiser choice,\r\nthere followed happier results; and it fell to him, and to the brave\r\nyoung general, Wolfe, his next in rank, to bring this long and irksome\r\nwar, in due course of time, to a glorious end. After the failure of\r\nBraddock's designs against Fort Duquesne, the conquest of Canada was\r\nmade the chief object of the British Government; and the regions of\r\nthe North thenceforth became the seat of war. While our young Virginia\r\ncolonel, making the best use of the slender means allowed him, was\r\nstruggling to keep back the pestilent savages and their pestilent\r\nwhite allies from his long line of frontier in the South and West,\r\nsome of these leaders with their red allies, and some of the French\r\nleaders with their red allies, were, with various fortunes and\r\nmisfortunes on either side, carrying on the war along the borders of\r\nthe great Lake Ontario, the little Lakes Champlain and George, and up\r\nand down the mighty St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nOf these English leaders, I will mention Lord Loudoun merely, as being\r\nthe only one with whom Washington had any special dealings. Had this\r\nnobleman come up to the hopes and expectations which many of the\r\ncolonists were at first wild enough to entertain respecting him, he\r\nwould have regained what Braddock had lost, overrun and conquered\r\nCanada, and made a clean finish of the whole French empire in America,\r\nin less than six months' time. They soon discovered, however, that he\r\nwas one of those unlucky persons, who, knowing much, seldom know what\r\nuse to make of their knowledge; who, having no will that they can call\r\ntheir own, can never turn the will of others to any good or seasonable\r\npurpose; and who, making a great show of doing, have never any thing\r\nto show in the end what they have done. In this last particular, Dr.\r\nFranklin, with that peculiar humor all his own, likened him to the\r\npicture of St. George on the sign, that was always on horseback, but\r\nnever riding on.\r\n\r\nNow, the recapture of Fort Duquesne, ever since the disgraceful\r\nfailure of that first attempt, had been the one object nearest to\r\nWashington's heart. Foreseeing that there could never be peace or\r\nsafety for the back settlements of the middle provinces so long as\r\nthis stronghold of the enemy sent out its savage swarms to scourge\r\nand waste the border, he had repeatedly called Lord Loudoun's\r\nattention to the fact, and most earnestly urged its seizure as the\r\nonly remedy. It was not, however, until early in the autumn of 1758,\r\nthat an expedition, having for its object his long-cherished scheme,\r\nwas set on foot. It was undertaken with a force of three thousand\r\nPennsylvanians, twelve hundred North Carolinians, Washington's\r\ndetachment of nineteen hundred Virginians, seven hundred Indians, and\r\na few hundred regulars,--numbering in all seven thousand men, or\r\nthereabouts,--with Gen. Forbes for their chief commander.\r\n\r\nAs an easy and rapid communication between the back settlements of\r\nVirginia and Pennsylvania would greatly lessen the difficulties of the\r\ncoming campaign, this officer caused a road to be opened between Fort\r\nCumberland and Raystown, a frontier post of the last-named province,\r\nwhere he had fixed his headquarters. Before the expedition could be\r\nput in motion, it was necessary that Col. Washington should go to\r\nWilliamsburg to make known to the Virginia Legislature the needy\r\ncondition of his soldiers, and make a call upon them for fresh\r\nsupplies of tents, blankets, clothing, wagons, arms, &c.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, attended by his trusty negro servant Bishop, and mounted\r\non his splendid white charger,--both of which had been bequeathed to\r\nhim by poor Braddock,--he set out on his journey, which proved an\r\neventful one indeed to him, as you shall directly see. At the ferry of\r\nthe Pamunkey, a branch of York River, he fell in with Mr. Chamberlin,\r\nan acquaintance of his, who, according to the hospitable customs of\r\nthose good old times, invited him to call at his house, not far\r\ndistant, and be his honored guest till morning. The young colonel\r\nwould be only too happy to do so: but the nature of his business was\r\nsuch as would not admit of an hour's delay; indeed, it was quite out\r\nof the question, and he must hasten on. But, his friend repeating the\r\ninvitation in a manner too earnest to be mistaken, he felt it would be\r\nuncourteous to refuse; and consented to stop and dine with him; on\r\ncondition, however, that he should be allowed to proceed on his\r\njourney that same evening. At his friend's hospitable mansion he met\r\nwith a gay and brilliant throng of ladies and gentlemen, who, though\r\nstrangers to him, knew him well by reputation, and were but too proud\r\nto be thus unexpectedly thrown in his company. Among them was Mrs.\r\nMartha Custis, a young and beautiful widow of good family and large\r\nfortune. Her husband had died three years before; leaving her with two\r\nsmall children, a girl and a boy. She is said to have been a lady of\r\nmost winning and engaging manners, and of an excellent and cultivated\r\nunderstanding. In stature she was a little below middle size, and of a\r\nround and extremely well-proportioned form; which, on this occasion,\r\nwas set off to the best advantage by a dress of rich blue silk. Her\r\nhair was dark; her features were pleasing and regular; and there was a\r\nlook of earnest, womanly softness in her hazel eyes, that found its\r\nway at once to the heart and confidence of all on whom it chanced to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe little folks will not, I hope, suffer their admiration and respect\r\nfor our young hero to be lessened in the least, if I tell them, that,\r\nlike the rest of mankind who came within the magic circle of those\r\nbewitching charms, he was first surprised into admiration, and then\r\nled, whether or no, at a single step, into the enchanted realms of\r\nlove. You have seen, how that, in his boyhood, he wrote broken-hearted\r\nverses to his Lowland Beauty; and how that, two or three years before,\r\nhe had nearly yielded himself captive to the beautiful Miss Phillipps:\r\nwhich ought to prove to the satisfaction of all reasonable minds, that\r\nWashington, like other men, had a heart of real human flesh, that now\r\nand then gave him not a little trouble, despite that grave and\r\ndignified reserve which hung about him like a spell, and, even at that\r\nearly age, was something to many quite overawing. The dinner, that had\r\nat first, in his hurry, seemed so long in coming on, seemed now quite\r\nas fast in going off. Not that I would have you suppose by this, that\r\nhe thought the guests were showing any indecent haste to make way with\r\nthe dishes that were set before them without number, and heaped up\r\nwithout measure, on Mr. Chamberlin's ample board. On the contrary,\r\nthey partook of the good things of the table with a well-bred\r\nslowness, that would have been beyond his endurance to bear, had Mars\r\nbeen thundering with his iron fist at the gates of his fortress. But\r\nas it was Cupid, only tapping with his rosy knuckles at the casement\r\nof his heart, that dinner seemed no longer to him than, no, not half\r\nso long indeed as, the shortest snack he had ever eaten on horseback\r\nin the hurry of a forced march. The dinner over, Washington seemed in\r\nno haste to depart.\r\n\r\nThe trusty Bishop, knowing well what a punctual man his master always\r\nwas, had appeared, according to orders, with the horses; and was\r\nplainly enough to be seen from the parlor window, had any one cared to\r\nlook that way, patiently waiting with them in the pleasant shade of an\r\napple-tree. The fiery white charger soon began to paw the ground,\r\nimpatient at his master's unwonted tardiness; but no rider came.\r\nBishop Braddock shifted his place once, twice, thrice, to keep himself\r\nand horses in the shade of the apple-tree; but still his master\r\nlingered: and the ivory grin that settled by degrees on his ebony mug\r\nshowed that he had a sly suspicion of what was going on in the house.\r\nThe afternoon sped away as if old Time, all of a sudden forgetting his\r\nrheumatism, had reached sunset at a single stride. Of course, they\r\nwould not suffer him to depart at this late hour: so Bishop was\r\nordered to restable the horses, and make himself easy and snug for the\r\nnight with the colored folks down at their quarters. The next morning,\r\nthe sun was hours on his journey to the west, before our love-smitten\r\nhero was on his way to Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nOnce in the saddle, however, all his yesterday's impatience returned\r\nupon him with redoubled force; and, giving his fiery white charger the\r\nspur, he dashed away at a break-neck speed on the road to the Virginia\r\ncapital. It is said, so fast did he travel on that day, that, to keep\r\nup with him, Bishop Braddock ran serious risk of having his woolly nob\r\nshaken from his shoulders by the high, hard trotter he rode; and so\r\nsore was he made by the jolting he got, that, for a week thereafter,\r\nit was quite as much as he could do to bring his legs together. This\r\nlast, by the way, is merely traditional, and must be received by the\r\nlittle folks with some caution.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the White House, the residence of Mrs. Custis, was situated\r\nwithin a very few miles of Williamsburg; which gave young Washington\r\nmany opportunities, during his two-weeks' stay at that place, of\r\nseeing her, and still further cultivating her acquaintance.\r\nExperience, that sage teacher who never spoke to him in vain, had\r\ntaught him, that although there are many blessings of this world which\r\nseem to come of their own accord, yet there are a few that never come\r\nexcept at the asking for; and the chiefest of these is woman's love.\r\nSo, resolving to profit by this knowledge, he did precisely what any\r\nwise and reasonable man would have done in his place,--overcame his\r\ntroublesome bashfulness, and made the lady an offer of marriage; which\r\nshe, precisely as any wise and reasonable woman would have done in her\r\nplace, modestly accepted. The business that had called him to\r\nWilliamsburg being at last disposed of, Washington took leave of his\r\nintended, after it had been agreed between them to keep up an\r\ninterchange of letters until the close of the present campaign, when\r\nthey were to be united in the holy bonds of wedlock.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Winchester, he was dismayed to find that the\r\nEnglish generals had taken it into their inexperienced heads to cut a\r\nnew road from Raystown to Fort Duquesne by the way of Laurel Hill,\r\ninstead of marching there at once by the old Braddock Road, as he\r\nnaturally supposed had been their intention from the beginning.\r\nForeseeing the consequences, he, in an earnest and forcible manner,\r\nhastened to represent to them the difficulties and disadvantages of\r\nsuch an undertaking. Cold weather would be setting in, he urged, long\r\nbefore they could cut their way through so many miles of that mountain\r\nwilderness to the point in question; and they would be obliged either\r\nto winter at Laurel Hill, or fall back upon the settlements until\r\nspring. This would give the enemy time to get full intelligence of\r\ntheir threatened danger, and send to Canada for re-enforcements. Their\r\nIndian allies too, as was their wont, would grow impatient at the long\r\ndelay that must needs attend this plan if carried out; and, returning\r\nto their homes in disgust, would fail to render to the expedition\r\ntheir valuable services as scouts and spies, as had been expected of\r\nthem. On the other hand, by taking the old road, they could march\r\ndirectly to the fort; which, being at that time but feebly garrisoned,\r\nmust fall almost without a blow, and this, too, in less than half the\r\ntime, and with less than half the trouble and expense. This prudent\r\ncounsel, coming from one, who, from his knowledge of the country, had\r\nso good a right to give it, was nevertheless overruled. The English\r\ngenerals had gathered a most appalling idea of the difficulties and\r\ndangers of this route from the account Braddock had given of it in his\r\nletters. He had therein described it as lying through a region where\r\nthe mountains were of the highest and steepest, the forests of the\r\nthickest and tallest, the rocks of the most huge and rugged, the\r\nswamps of the deepest, and the torrents of the swiftest. The route for\r\nthe new road, on the contrary, according to the Pennsylvanians, who\r\nsaw in it a great advantage to themselves, lay through a region where\r\nthe mountains were not by far so lofty, the woods so thick, the rocks\r\nso huge, the swamps so deep, nor the streams so swift, or half so\r\ngiven to running rampant over their banks. All these advantages this\r\nroute had, besides being fifty miles shorter. So, under the mistaken\r\nnotion that more was to be gained by following a short road that would\r\ntake them a long time in getting over, than by following a long one\r\nthat would take them but a short time in getting over, they resolved\r\nto cut the new road.\r\n\r\nThis was a sore disappointment to Col. Washington; for he saw in it a\r\nlikelihood of Braddock's folly being played all over again, and that,\r\ntoo, on a still larger scale. The tidings of glorious victories won by\r\nBritish arms in the North had filled the whole country with triumph\r\nand rejoicing, that rendered him all the more impatient at the\r\ntardiness with which their own expedition was moving forward. \"He\r\nwished to rival the successes of the North by some brilliant blow in\r\nthe South. Perhaps a desire for personal distinction in the eyes of\r\nthe lady of his choice may have been at the bottom of his impatience.\"\r\nThis last, it is but fair to say, is an assertion of our great\r\ncountryman, Washington Irving; who, being a wise and learned\r\nhistorian, would not have made it, you may be sure, had not his deep\r\ninsight into the workings of the human heart given him a perfect right\r\nso to do. If this be not enough to convince you that such was really\r\nthe case, know that your Uncle Juvinell is entirely of the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nMORE BLUNDERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, about the middle of September, the expedition was set in\r\nmotion. Gen. Forbes sent Col. Boquet in advance, with nearly two\r\nthousand men, to open and level the road. In order to get more certain\r\ninformation touching the condition of the enemy,--his number,\r\nstrength, and probable designs,--it was thought advisable by some of\r\nthe officers to send out a large party of observation in the direction\r\nof Fort Duquesne. It was to be made up of British regulars, Scotch\r\nHighlanders, and Pennsylvania and Virginia rangers,--eight hundred\r\npicked men in all. Washington strongly disapproved the plan, on the\r\nground that the regulars, being wholly unacquainted with the Indian\r\nmode of fighting, and unable to operate at so great a distance without\r\ntaking with them a cumbrous train of baggage, would prove a\r\nhinderance, instead of a furtherance, to an enterprise which must\r\nneeds owe its success to the caution, silence, secrecy, and swiftness\r\non the part of those engaged. He therefore advised the sending-out of\r\nsmall companies of rangers and Indian hunters, who, knowing the\r\ncountry well, could spy out the enemy with less risk of detection to\r\nthemselves, and, moving without baggage, could make far better speed\r\nwith the tidings they may have gathered. The like advice, you may\r\nremember, he gave to Braddock. It met with a like reception, and the\r\nlike disaster was the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe party set out from Laurel Hill, and began its tedious tramp across\r\nthe fifty miles of wilderness that lay between that point and Fort\r\nDuquesne. It was headed by Major Grant, a noisy, blustering braggart,\r\nwho, hankering after notoriety rather than seeking praise for duty\r\nwell and faithfully done, went beyond the limits of his instructions;\r\nwhich were simply to find out all he could about the enemy, without\r\nsuffering the enemy to find out more than he could help about himself,\r\nand, by all possible means, to avoid a battle. But, instead of\r\nconducting the expedition with silence and circumspection, he marched\r\nalong in so open and boisterous a manner, as made it appear he meant\r\nto give the enemy timely notice of his coming, and bully him into an\r\nattack even while yet on the way. The French, keeping themselves well\r\ninformed, by their spies, of his every movement, suffered him to\r\napproach almost to their very gates without molestation. When he got\r\nin the neighborhood of the fort, he posted himself on a hill\r\noverlooking it, and began throwing up intrenchments in full view of\r\nthe garrison. As if all this were not imprudence enough, and as if\r\nbent on provoking the enemy to come out and give him battle on the\r\ninstant, whether or no, he sent down a party of observation to spy out\r\nyet more narrowly the inside plan and defences of the fort; who were\r\nsuffered not only to do this, but even to burn a house just outside\r\nthe walls, and then return to their intrenchments, without a hostile\r\nsign betokening the unseen foe so silent yet watchful within.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, as if to give the enemy warning of the\r\nthreatened danger, the drums of the regulars beat the _reveille_, and\r\nthe bagpipes of the Highlanders woke the forest-echoes far and wide\r\nwith their wild and shrilly din. All this time, not a gun had been\r\nfired from the fort. The deathly silence that reigned within was\r\nmistaken for fear, and made the fool-hardy Grant so audacious as to\r\nfancy that he had but to raise his finger, and the fort must fall. As\r\nBraddock's day had begun with martial parade and music, so likewise\r\ndid this. As on that day the regulars were sent in advance, while the\r\nVirginians were left in the rear to guard the baggage, so was likewise\r\ndone on this. On this day, as on that, not an enemy was to be seen,\r\ntill, all of a sudden, a quick and heavy firing was opened upon them\r\nby Indians lurking in ambush on either side; while, at the same\r\nmoment, the French flung open their gates, and, rushing out, mingled\r\ntheir loud shouts with the horrid yells of their savage allies. On\r\nthis day, as had been done on that, the regulars, surprised,\r\nbewildered, panic-stricken, were thrown at once into disorder, and\r\nbegan firing their pieces at random, killing friend as well as foe.\r\nUnlike them, however, the Highlanders stood their ground like men,\r\nand, fighting bravely, cheered each other with their slogan, or wild\r\nbattle-cry. On this day, as on that, the Virginians came up in the\r\nvery nick of time to rescue the helpless regulars from utter\r\ndestruction. On this, as on Braddock's day, the Indians, seeing the\r\nhopeless confusion into which the English had fallen, rushed out from\r\ntheir ambush with yells of triumph, and fell upon them, tomahawk and\r\nscalping-knife in hand. Major Lewis, the brave leader of the\r\nVirginians, fought hand to hand with a tall warrior, whom he laid dead\r\nat his feet; but, soon overpowered by numbers, he was forced to\r\nsurrender himself to a French officer, who received his sword. The\r\nblustering Grant, more lucky than the headstrong Braddock, saved his\r\nlife by yielding himself up in like manner.\r\n\r\nAnd now the rout became general, and the slaughter dreadful. Seeing\r\nthe unlooked-for turn affairs had taken, Capt. Bullitt, whom Major\r\nLewis had left to guard the baggage, gathered a few of his brave\r\nVirginians about him, and prepared to make a desperate stand. Sending\r\nback the strongest horses with the baggage, he blocked up the road\r\nwith the wagons, and, behind the barricade thus formed, posted his\r\nmen, to whom he gave a few brief orders how to act. These scanty\r\npreparations were hardly made, when the Indians, having finished the\r\nwork of plunder, had sprung into swift pursuit, and were now close\r\nupon them, the wild woods ringing with their terrible whoops and\r\nyells. When they had come within short rifle-range, Capt. Bullitt and\r\nhis men met them with a well-aimed volley of musketry from behind the\r\nshelter of their wagons; which, however, checked the savages but for a\r\nmoment. Rallying on the instant, they were pressing forward in still\r\ngreater numbers; when Capt. Bullitt held out a signal of surrender,\r\nand came out from behind the barricade at the head of his men, as if\r\nto lay down their arms: but no sooner were they within eight yards of\r\nthe enemy, and near enough to see the fierce light that shone in their\r\neyes, than they suddenly levelled their pieces, and poured a murderous\r\nfire into the thickest of them; then, charging bayonets, scattered\r\nthem in every direction, and sent them yelling with astonishment and\r\ndismay. Before they could rally again, and renew the pursuit, Capt.\r\nBullitt, having picked up many more of the fugitives, began a rapid\r\nbut orderly retreat.\r\n\r\nFor several days thereafter, the fugitives, singly or in squads, came\r\nstraggling into camp at Loyal Hannon. Of the eight hundred picked men\r\nwho had been sent out with such good promise of success, twenty\r\nofficers and two hundred and seventy-three privates had been left\r\nbehind, either killed or taken prisoners. The whole force of the\r\nenemy, French and Indians, did not exceed that of the English: their\r\nloss in the battle is not known; but, as the Highlanders fought well\r\nand the Virginians fought well, it must have been heavy. The disaster\r\nforeboded by Washington had thus in reality fallen upon them. He was\r\nat Raystown when the dismal tidings came; and, although complimented\r\nby Gen. Forbes upon the bravery his rangers had displayed, was deeply\r\ngrieved and mortified. In secret, many a man would have been gratified\r\nat beholding a prophecy he had uttered thus fulfilled; but Washington,\r\nincapable of such selfish and unnatural vanity, could but sorrow\r\nthereat, although it must needs increase his reputation for foresight\r\nand sagacity. As the only good thing that came from this defeat, I\r\nmust tell you (and you will be glad to hear it) that Capt. Bullitt was\r\nrewarded with a major's commission for the gallant and soldierly\r\nconduct he had shown on that disastrous day in the midst of such\r\nfearful perils.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the middle of November that the whole army came up to\r\nLoyal Hannon, a little distance beyond Laurel Hill. Winter was coming\r\non apace. What with rain and snow and frost, the roads would soon be\r\nrendered impassable, not only to wheeled carriages, but to pack-horses\r\nalso. Fifty miles of unbroken wilderness lay between them and Fort\r\nDuquesne,--so long the goal of their hopes and toils, that seemed to\r\nrecede as they advanced, like some enchanted castle we have read of\r\nbefore now in books of fairy tales, that poor benighted travellers\r\nnever reach, although, in fancy, every step they take brings them\r\nnearer. The leaders began to talk seriously of going into\r\nwinter-quarters at that place until the return of spring; and it\r\nseemed as if another of Washington's prophecies were likely to be\r\nfulfilled. But, about this time, two prisoners from Fort Duquesne were\r\nbrought into camp; from whom they drew such an account of the weakness\r\nof the French, and the discontent and daily desertions of their Indian\r\nallies, as determined them to push forward without further delay, in\r\nspite of the wintry weather, and, at one fell blow, make a finish of\r\nthe campaign. So, leaving behind them their tents and baggage, and\r\ntaking with them but a few pieces of light artillery, they once more\r\nresumed their toilsome march. Col. Washington was ordered to go on in\r\nadvance with a part of his detachment, to throw out scouts and\r\nscouting parties, who were to scour the woods in every direction, and\r\nthereby prevent the possibility of an ambuscade. This new arrangement,\r\nwhich showed that Gen. Forbes had the wisdom to profit by the folly of\r\nthose who had gone before him, was a signal proof of the high esteem\r\nin which provincial troops were at last beginning to be held; and to\r\nwhich, by their courage, skill, and hardihood, they had, even years\r\nbefore, won so just a title.\r\n\r\nWhen within a few miles of the French fort, the road began to show\r\nsigns of the late disaster. Here and there were to be seen the\r\nblackened and mangled bodies of men, who, while fleeing for their\r\nlives, had been overtaken, and cut down by the murderous tomahawk; or,\r\nexhausted from the loss of blood, had there, by the lonely wayside,\r\nlaid them down to die of their wounds. As they advanced, these ghastly\r\ntokens of defeat and massacre were to be met with at shorter and\r\nshorter intervals, till at length they lay thickly scattered about the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nBeing now in close neighborhood with the enemy, the English moved with\r\neven greater caution and wariness than before; for they had every\r\nreason to suspect, that, as he had suffered them to come thus far\r\nwithout molestation, he meant to meet them here, under shelter of his\r\nstronghold, with a resistance all the move determined. When come in\r\nsight, however, what was their surprise, instead of beholding the high\r\nramparts and strong walls, grim and frowning with cannon, which they\r\nhad pictured to their minds, to find a heap of blackened and smoking\r\nruins!\r\n\r\nDeserted by his Indian allies, threatened with famine, cut off from\r\nall hope of aid from the North (where the English were everywhere\r\ngaining ground), and with a force of but five hundred men wherewith to\r\ndefend the post against ten times that number, the French general had\r\nseen that the attempt to hold it would be but folly; and, like a\r\nprudent officer, had resolved to abandon it as his only chance of\r\nsafety. Waiting, therefore, until the English were within a day's\r\nmarch of the place, he blew up the magazine, set fire to the works,\r\nand, embarking in his bateaux by the light of the flames, retreated\r\ndown the Ohio.\r\n\r\nCol. Washington, still leading the advance, was the first to enter;\r\nand, with his own hand planting the British banner on the still\r\nsmouldering heaps, took formal possession thereof in the name of his\r\nBritannic majesty, King George the Second. And thus this stronghold of\r\nFrench power in the Ohio Valley, so long the pest and terror of the\r\nborder, fell without a blow. Under the name of Fort Pitt, it was soon\r\nrebuilt, and garrisoned with two hundred of Washington's men; and,\r\nfrom that time to the war of the Revolution, it was held by the\r\nEnglish, chiefly as a trading-post; and hence the dingy, smoky, noisy,\r\nthriving, fast young city of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThey now had leisure to pay the last sad duty to the dead who had\r\nfallen in the two defeats of Braddock and Grant. For three long years,\r\nthe bodies of Braddock's slaughtered men had lain without Christian\r\nburial, bleaching in the sun of as many summers, and shrouded in the\r\nsnows of as many winters. Mingled with the bones of oxen and horses,\r\nor half hidden in heaps of autumn leaves, they lay scattered about the\r\nstony hillsides,--a spectacle ghastly indeed, and most melancholy to\r\nbehold. With many a sigh of pity for the hapless dead, and many a\r\nshudder of dark remembrance on the part of those who had been present\r\nat the scenes of rout and massacre, they gathered together the\r\nblackened corpses of Grant's men and the whitened bones of Braddock's\r\nmen, and, digging a huge pit, buried them in one common grave. In this\r\npious duty all took part alike, from the general down to the common\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Fort Duquesne, ended, as Washington had years ago\r\nforeseen, the troubles of the Western and Southern frontiers, and with\r\nit the power so long held by the French in the Ohio Valley. The\r\nIndians, with that fickleness of mind peculiar to savage races, now\r\nhastened to offer terms of amity and peace to the party whom the\r\nfortunes of war had left uppermost.\r\n\r\nHaving done his part, and so large a part, towards the restoration of\r\nquiet and security to his native province, the cherished object of his\r\nheart, for which he had so faithfully and manfully struggled,\r\nWashington resolved to bring his career as a soldier to a close. In\r\nhis very soul, he was sick and weary of strife, and longed for peace.\r\nThe scenes of violence and bloodshed had become loathing and painful\r\nto him beyond the power of words to tell; and, now that his country\r\nhad no longer need of his services, he felt that he could, without\r\nreproach, retire to the tranquil shades of private life he loved so\r\nmuch, and had looked forward to with such earnest longings. He\r\ntherefore, at the end of the year, gave up his commission, and left\r\nthe service, followed by the admiration and affection of his soldiers,\r\nand the applause and gratitude of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Quebec in the course of the following year (1759),\r\nthis long and eventful Old French War was brought to a close, and\r\nFrench empire in America was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done all that a brave and prudent man could for his country's\r\nwelfare, Col. Washington now lost no time, you may depend upon it, in\r\ndoing what every wise and prudent man should for his own: by which you\r\nare to understand, that on the sixth day of January, 1759, when he\r\nwanted but a few weeks of completing his twenty-seventh year, he was\r\njoined in the holy bonds of marriage with Mrs. Martha Custis, the\r\nblooming and lovely young widow, and mother of the two interesting\r\nlittle children,--to all of whom you had a slight introduction a short\r\ntime ago.\r\n\r\nThe nuptials were celebrated at the White House, the home of the\r\nbride, in the presence of a goodly company of stately dames and fine\r\nold gentlemen, fair maidens and handsome youth,--the kith and kin and\r\nloving friends of the wedded pair. Had some belated traveller been\r\novertaken by the little hours of that night, as he chanced to pass\r\nthat way, he might have guessed, from the soft, warm light that shone\r\nfrom all of the many windows, and sounds of sweet music that came\r\nthrough the open doors, mingled with peals of joyous laughter, and the\r\nlight tripping of numerous feet in the merry dance, that it must be a\r\nmuch-beloved and fortunate couple indeed that could draw together so\r\nhappy and brilliant a throng under that hospitable roof. Had this same\r\nbelated traveller wanted further proof of this, he had but to turn a\r\nlittle aside, and take a peep into the negro quarters, where he would\r\nhave seen the colored folks in a jubilee over the grand occasion, and,\r\nto all appearances, quite as jolly as if the wedding had been an\r\naffair of their own getting-up, and in which each son and daughter of\r\nebony had a personal interest. He would have seen them feasting on the\r\nabundant leavings that came down from the great house, till their\r\nfaces shone again; and dancing to the music of Bishop Braddock's\r\nfiddle in a fashion all their own, and nobody's else.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost among these, with his wool combed the highest, his\r\nbreeches the reddest, and manners the genteelest, might have been\r\nspied Black Jerry (who, when a negroling, had been saved from a\r\nthrashing by little George, as you well remember), showing off his\r\nheels to the envy of all male and the admiration of all female\r\nbeholders. This last, it is but fair to say, is merely a fancy sketch\r\nof your Uncle Juvinell's, conjured up by recollections of certain long\r\ntalks he often had, when a boy, with Black Jerry himself, at that time\r\na very old negro of most excellent morals, who never failed, when his\r\nhonored master's name was mentioned, to show his yellow ivory, and,\r\nfor very respect, uncover his head, the wool of which was then as\r\nwhite as a Merino ram's.\r\n\r\nThis joyous event having passed thus happily off, Col. Washington, a\r\nshort time after, repaired to Williamsburg to take his seat in the\r\nVirginia Legislature, or House of Burgesses as it was then called, to\r\nwhich he had been elected while absent on the last campaign; without,\r\nhowever, any particular desire or effort on his part, but by that of\r\nhis numerous friends. Hardly had his name been enrolled as a member of\r\nthat honorable body, when Mr. Robinson, Speaker of the House, by\r\nprevious agreement arose and addressed him in a short but eloquent\r\nspeech; thanking him, in the name of the rest, for the many and\r\nvaluable services he had rendered his country during the past five\r\nyears, and setting forth the gratitude and esteem with which he was\r\nregarded by his fellow-countrymen. Surprised out of his usual\r\ncomposure and self-possession by the honor thus unexpectedly done him,\r\nWashington, upon rising to thank the House, could only blush, stammer,\r\nand stand trembling, without the power to utter a single word. Seeing\r\nhis painful embarrassment, Mr. Robinson hastened to his relief by\r\nsaying with a courteous smile, \"Sit down, Mr. Washington: your modesty\r\nequals your valor; and that surpasses the power of any language I\r\npossess.\" From that time till near the breaking-cut of the\r\nRevolution,--a period of fifteen years, he remained an active and\r\ninfluential member of this body; being returned from year to year by\r\nthe united voice of the good people whose district he represented.\r\nAlways thorough in whatever he undertook, he rested not until he had\r\nmade himself muster of every point and question touching the duties of\r\nhis new office; and, for method, promptness, prudence, and sagacity,\r\nsoon proved himself quite as good a civilian as he had been a soldier.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following spring, his first session ended, he betook\r\nhimself to the sweet retirement of Mount Vernon; where, cheered by the\r\ncompany of his beautiful young wife and her interesting little\r\nchildren, he once more resumed those peaceful pursuits and innocent\r\namusements to which he had looked forward with such bright\r\nanticipations amidst the perils and hardships of a soldier's life.\r\nWar, as war, had already, young and ardent as he was, lost for him its\r\ncharms; and he had learned to look upon it as a hard and terrible\r\nnecessity, ever to be avoided, except in cases where the safety of his\r\ncountry should demand it as a last desperate remedy. Unlike most men\r\nof a bold and adventurous disposition, he all his life long took the\r\ngreatest pleasure in the pursuits of a husbandman; and, to his manner\r\nof thinking, there was no lot or calling in life so happy, and none\r\nmore honorable. Having now ample time for the indulgence of his\r\ntastes, he set about improving and beautifying his plantations, of\r\nwhich he had several, in the most approved style of that day. He\r\nplanted orchards of various fruits; set his hillsides in grass;\r\ndrained his marshes, and turned them into rich meadow-lands; built\r\nmills and blacksmith-shops; enlarged his family mansion to a size\r\nbetter befitting his elegant and hospitable style of living; adorned\r\nthe grounds about it with shrubbery, trees, and gardens; and converted\r\nthe wild woods hard by into open and verdant parks. To his negro\r\nslaves he was the kindest of masters; ever mindful of their comfort,\r\nand extremely careful of them in sickness. Being of industrious habits\r\nhimself, he would not make the least grain of allowance for sloth or\r\nidleness in them, or indeed in any one about him, but was strict in\r\nexacting of them the speedy and full performance of their allotted\r\ntasks; which, however, he always took care should come under rather\r\nthan up to the measure of their strength. In his business habits, he\r\nwas methodical to a nicety; kept his own books, and was his own\r\noverseer: for, having a strong aversion to being waited on, he never\r\nsuffered others to do for him what he could do for himself. He kept a\r\nclose and clear account, in writing, of the profits arising from the\r\ngrain, tobacco, and other produce of his lands; and also the amount of\r\nhis personal, household, and plantation expenses: by which means he\r\ncould tell at a glance whether he were on the making or losing order,\r\nand readily detect whether any of whom he had dealings were given to\r\ncareless or dishonest practices. So superior was the quality of every\r\nthing produced on his estate, and so widely known did he become for\r\nhis honesty and uprightness in all business transactions, that, in\r\ntime, a box of tobacco or a barrel of flour marked \"George Washington,\r\nMount Vernon, Va.,\" would be received into many foreign ports without\r\nthe custom-house authorities opening or inspecting it.\r\n\r\nHe was an early riser. In winter, getting up before day, and lighting\r\nhis own fire, he wrote or read two or three hours by candle-light.\r\nAfter a frugal breakfast of two small cups of tea and four small cakes\r\nof Indian meal, he mounted his horse, and rode about his plantations;\r\nseeing to every thing with his own eye, and often lending a helping\r\nhand. This duty done, he returned to the house at noon, and dined\r\nheartily, as well beseemed the active, robust man that he was, yet\r\nnever exceeding the bounds of temperance and moderation both as to\r\neating and drinking. His afternoons he usually devoted to the\r\nentertainment of his numerous guests, who thronged his hospitable\r\nmansion almost daily, and, if from a distance, abiding there for weeks\r\ntogether. After a supper frugal as his breakfast, if there was no\r\ncompany in the house, he would read aloud to his family from some\r\ninstructive and entertaining book, or from the newspapers of the day;\r\nand then, at an early hour, retire to his room for the night.\r\n\r\nFish and game abounded in the woods and streams of his domain, as well\r\nas in those of the adjoining plantations; and he was thus enabled to\r\nindulge his fondness for angling and hunting to the utmost, whenever\r\nhe felt so inclined. Two or three times a week, the shrill winding of\r\nthe hunter's horn and the deep-mouthed baying of the fox-hounds would\r\nring out on the clear morning air; when he might be seen at the head\r\nof a brilliant company of mounted hunters, dashing over the fields,\r\nacross the streams, and through the woods, hot on the heels of some\r\nunlucky Reynard. I should not say unlucky, however; for although\r\nWashington was as bold and skilful a rider as could be found in\r\nthirteen provinces, and kept the finest of horses and finest of dogs,\r\nyet, for all that, he could seldom boast of any great success as a\r\nfox-hunter. But having the happy knack of making the best and most of\r\nevery thing, be it toward or untoward, he always consoled himself with\r\nthe reflection, that, if they had failed to catch their fox, they at\r\nleast had their sport and a deal of healthful exercise; which, after\r\nall, should be the only object of fox-hunting. On such occasions, he\r\nwas either joined by the neighboring gentry, or by such guests as\r\nchanced at the time to be enjoying the hospitalities of Mount Vernon.\r\nAmong these, it was not unusual to find old Lord Fairfax, the friend\r\nand companion of his stripling days, who would come down from Greenway\r\nCourt several times a year, with a long train of hunters and hounds,\r\nand by his presence double the mirth and cheer of all the country-side\r\nfor miles and miles around. The fate of poor Reynard being duly\r\nsettled, they would repair either to Mount Vernon, or to the residence\r\nof any one else of the party that chanced to be nearest, and wind up\r\nthe sports of the day by a hunting-dinner, at which they were usually\r\nfavored with the company of the ladies. At such times, Washington is\r\nsaid to have entered so keenly into the general hilarity, as to quite\r\nlay aside his accustomed gravity and reserve, and show himself almost\r\nas jovial as the merry old lord himself. Speaking of these amusements,\r\nbrings to mind an anecdote of him, which I must tell you, as it will\r\ngive you a still more lively idea of the promptness and decision with\r\nwhich he was wont to act whenever occasion demanded.\r\n\r\nIn those old-fashioned times, among many other laws that would seem\r\nodd enough to us at the present day, there were many very strict and\r\nsevere ones for the protection of game, which made poaching (that is\r\nto say, hunting on private grounds without leave or license from the\r\nowner) no less a crime than theft, and punished the poacher as a thief\r\naccordingly. Now, there was a certain idle, worthless fellow,\r\nnotorious for his desperate character, as being the most daring\r\npoacher in seven counties, who was known to be much in the habit of\r\ntrespassing on the grounds belonging to Mount Vernon. This had been\r\nforbidden him by Washington, who had warned him of the consequences if\r\nhe did not cease his depredations, and keep at a safe distance; but to\r\nthis the sturdy vagrant gave little heed. He would cross over the\r\nriver in a canoe, which he would hide, in some secret nook best known\r\nto himself, among the reeds and rushes that fringed the banks, and\r\nwith his fowling-piece make ruinous havoc among the canvas-back ducks\r\nthat flocked in great multitudes to the low marsh-lands of that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, as Washington was going his accustomed rounds about the\r\nplantations, he heard the report of a gun in the neighborhood of the\r\nriver; and, guessing what was in the wind, he forthwith spurred his\r\nhorse in that direction, and, dashing through the bushes, came upon\r\nthe culprit, just as he, paddle in hand, was pushing from the shore.\r\nThe fellow, seeing his danger, cocked his gun, and, with a threatening\r\nlook, levelled it directly at Washington, who, without heeding this in\r\nthe least, rode into the water, and, seizing the canoe by the painter,\r\ndragged it ashore. Leaping then from his horse, he wrenched the\r\nfowling-piece from the astonished poacher, and fell to belaboring him\r\nin so clean and handsome a manner, as to make the unlucky wight\r\nheartily wish he had the wide Potomac between him and the terrible man\r\nwhose iron grasp was then on his collar. My word for it, he never\r\ntrespassed again on those forbidden grounds; and I dare be sworn, he\r\nnever saw or ate or smelt a canvas-back thereafter, without feeling a\r\nlively smarting up and down under his jacket, and, it may be, his\r\nbuckskin breeches too. It was not that a few dozen or even a hundred\r\nducks had been shot on his premises, that Washington was thus moved to\r\nchastise this fellow; but that, in spite of wholesome warnings, he\r\nshould go on breaking the laws of the land with such impunity; and\r\nalso, that, instead of seeking to earn an honest livelihood by the\r\nlabor of his hands, he should prefer rather to live in idleness, and\r\ngain a bare subsistence by such paltry and unlawful means.\r\n\r\nAlthough verging on to middle age, Washington was still very fond of\r\nactive and manly sports, such as tossing the bar and throwing the\r\nsledge, wrestling, running, and jumping; in all of which he had but\r\nfew equals, and no superiors. Among other stories of his strength and\r\nagility, there is one which you may come across some day in the course\r\nof your reading, relating how that, at a leaping-match, he cleared\r\ntwenty-two feet seven inches of dead level turf at a single bound.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his modesty and reserve, he took much pleasure in\r\nsociety, and ever sought to keep up a free and social interchange of\r\nvisits between his family and those of his neighbors. Besides their\r\nfine horses and elegant carriages, he, and others of the old Virginia\r\ngentry of that day whose plantations lay along the Potomac, kept their\r\nown barges or pleasure-boats, which were finished and fitted up in a\r\nsumptuous style, and were sometimes rowed by as many as six negro men,\r\nall in neat uniforms. In these, they, with their wives and children,\r\nwould visit each other up and down the river; and often, after\r\nlengthening out their calls far into the night, would row home by the\r\nlight of the moon, which, lending charms that the sun had not to the\r\ntranquil flow of the winding stream, and to the waving woods that\r\ncrowned the banks on either hand, caused them often to linger, as\r\nloath to quit the enchanting scene. A few weeks of the winter months\r\nwere usually spent by Mr. and Mrs. Washington either at Williamsburg\r\nor at Annapolis, then, as now, the capital of Maryland, where was to\r\nbe found the best society of the provinces, and of which they were the\r\npride and ornament. Here they entered into the gayeties of the season,\r\nsuch as dinners and balls, with much real relish; and, if the theatre\r\nadded its attractions to the rest, Washington always made it a point\r\nto attend, as the entertainments there offered were of the sort that\r\nafforded him much delight. Nor was he loath to join in the dance; and\r\nyour Uncle Juvinell, when a boy, had the rare fortune of meeting, now\r\nand then, with stately old dames, who had been belles in their days,\r\nand could boast of having had him for a partner; but, at the same\r\ntime, they were wont to confess, that they were generally too much\r\noverawed by the gravity and dignity of his demeanor to feel entirely\r\nat their ease in his company, however flattered they may have been at\r\nthe honor, which he, in his modesty, so little dreamed he was doing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWashington's marriage was never blessed with children; but he was all\r\nthat a father could be to those of Mrs. Washington, whom he loved and\r\ncherished as tenderly as if they had been his own. As their guardian,\r\nhe had the care of their education, and also the entire control of the\r\nimmense fortune, amounting, in negroes, land, and money, to nearly two\r\nhundred thousand dollars, left them by their father, Mr. George\r\nCustis; and lovingly and faithfully did he discharge this sacred and\r\ndelicate trust. Of these two children, the daughter (who was the\r\nyounger of the two) died, in early maidenhood, of consumption. She had\r\nbeen of a slender constitution from her childhood; but, for all that,\r\nher death was an unexpected stroke, and was long and deeply mourned by\r\nMrs. Washington and her husband. He is said to have been absent during\r\nher illness; but, returning a short time before she breathed her last,\r\nwas so overcome with pity and tenderness upon seeing the sad change\r\nwrought in so brief a space by this dreadful disease in her fair young\r\nface and delicate form, that he threw himself upon his knees by her\r\nbedside, and, in a passionate burst of grief, poured out a fervent\r\nprayer for her recovery. The son now became the sole object of\r\nparental love and solicitude; and being, like his sister, of frail and\r\nuncertain health, was a source of much affectionate anxiety to his\r\nstep-father as well as to his mother.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Washington were members of the Episcopal Church, and\r\npersons of the truest Christian piety. Every sabbath, when the roads\r\nand weather permitted, they attended divine worship either at\r\nAlexandria or at a church in their own neighborhood, and always took\r\npart in the religious exercises of the day with earnest and solemn\r\ndevotion. In addition to the many charms of mind and person already\r\nmentioned, Mrs. Washington was a woman of great benevolence, and spent\r\nmuch of her time in acts of kindness and charity, which won her the\r\nlove and gratitude of every poor family in the country around.\r\n\r\nThus passed away fifteen tranquil years,--the white days of\r\nWashington's life. When we behold him as he was then, in the full\r\nstrength and beauty of his ripened manhood, possessed of one of\r\nthe handsomest fortunes in America, living in the bountiful and\r\nelegant style of those hospitable times, the pride and honor of\r\nhis native province, the object of applause and gratitude to his\r\nfellow-countrymen, and of esteem and love to all whose privilege it\r\nwas to call him friend; and, above all, blessed, in the partner of his\r\nchoice, with a woman gifted with every grace and virtue that can adorn\r\nher sex,--when we behold him thus, well may we exclaim, \"Verily, here\r\nwas a man favored of Heaven in a special manner, and blessed beyond\r\nthe lot of common mortals here below.\" But the clouds were gathering,\r\nand had long been gathering, that were soon to burst in storm and\r\ntempest over that happy and rising young land, and force him for\r\nmany, many weary years from those, his loved retreats and peaceful\r\npursuits, upon a wider, nobler field of action, wherein he was to play\r\na part that should, in fine, win for him the name so dear to every\r\nAmerican heart,--Father of his Country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nA FAMILY QUARREL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And now, Dannie, mend the fire with another Christmas log. You,\r\nWillie, open the windows at top and bottom, to let out the smoke the\r\nyoung historian will be sure to raise. Laura, my dear, trim the lamp;\r\nand you, Ella,--will you have the kindness to put a little sugar in\r\nyour uncle's cider?--there's a darling! Ned, my boy, just tumble\r\nsleepy-headed Charlie there out of his comfortable nap, and touse him\r\ninto his waking senses again. All right? Now I would have every one of\r\nyou put your thinking-caps square and tight upon your heads, and keep\r\nall your ears about you; for, depend upon it, what I am now going to\r\ntell you is so full of hard points and tough knots, that, should you\r\nbut lose the crossing of a 't,' or even the dotting of an 'i,'\r\nthereof, all the rest will be to you as so much hifalutin\r\ntranscendentalism.\" (Here Uncle Juvinell took a gigantic swallow of\r\ncider, and pronounced the sugar a decided improvement; while the\r\nlittle folks wrote something on their slates, very long, and which no\r\ntwo of them spelt alike. Uncle Juvinell smacked his lips, and then\r\nresumed.)\r\n\r\nNow, you must know, my dear children, that Great Britain, at the time\r\nof which we are speaking, was, and for many years had been, and, in\r\nfact, still is, and, in all human likelihood, will ever continue to\r\nbe, burdened with a mountain-load of debt, which has already given her\r\na frightful stoop in the shoulders, and may, in time, grow to such an\r\nenormous bulk as to break her sturdy old back outright. She had, as\r\nyou have seen, added all French America to her dominions; but with\r\nthis increase of power and glory, that made her king and nobles smile\r\nand sing with joy, came also an increase of debt and trouble, that\r\nmade her common people scowl and growl with want and discontent. The\r\nexpenses of the late war with France had added the weight of another\r\nAEtna or Sinai to the already staggering load that chafed her back;\r\nand, sorely grieved thereat, she began casting in her mind what might\r\nbe done to lighten it a little.\r\n\r\n\"My young Colonies,\" said our mother to herself, \"which were planted\r\nby my love so many years ago, have grown to a goodly size, and\r\nprospered in a wonderful manner, under my fostering care, for which\r\nthey owe me many thanks; and, being quite old and strong enough, must\r\nnow repay it by taking their due share of my heavy burden.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in all this, our mother did but deceive herself: for these\r\nColonies had been planted by her oppression, not by her love; they\r\nhad grown by her neglect, not by her fostering care. Therefore, they\r\ndid not, as she pretended, owe her either love or thanks, although\r\nthey gave her both; and she had no right to make them carry her burden\r\nwithout their consent. Strange as it may appear, these infant Colonies\r\nloved their mother to distraction, in spite of her unmotherly\r\ntreatment of them; and would have gone any length to serve her,--even\r\nto the extent of bearing double the burden she would have laid on\r\nthem,--had she been wise enough to consult their wishes about the\r\nmatter, and suffer them to lay it on their own shoulders, in their own\r\nfashion, and of their own free will. To this the perverse old mother\r\nwould not listen for a moment; and, without pausing to reflect what\r\nmight be the consequences, took an AEtna or a Sinai from the load on\r\nher own shoulders, and clapped it on those of her children, who sat\r\ndown under it plump, and sturdily refused to budge until they should\r\nbe allowed to put it there themselves. Whereupon, this stiff-necked,\r\nwrong-headed old Britannia (for such was her Christian name) was\r\nexceeding wroth, made an outlandish noise among the nations, and even\r\nwent so far (you will be shocked to hear) as to swear a little. Seeing\r\nthere was no help for it but to remove this AEtna, she did so with as\r\ngood a grace as could be expected in a family-quarrel; but was so\r\nindiscreet and short-sighted as still to leave a very small burden,--a\r\nmere hillock indeed,--just by way, as she said, of showing that she\r\nhad the right to load and unload them when and how it suited her\r\nsovereign pleasure best.\r\n\r\nNow, be it known, it was not the burden they had to carry of which\r\nthese generous and high-spirited Colonies complained so bitterly; but\r\nthat they should be denied the right of freely judging when and how\r\nand wherefore they were to be taxed,--a right that had been the pride\r\nand boast of Englishmen time out of mind. As for the matter of the\r\nburden, had that been all, they could have danced, ay, and blithely\r\ntoo, under AEtna and Sinai both, had the load but been of their own\r\nchoosing, of their own putting-on, and of their own adjusting.\r\n\r\nTo add to their distress and humiliation, this hardest and\r\nunnaturalest of mothers now set over them judges, who were strangers\r\nto them, and loved them not; who were to hold their places, not, as\r\ntheretofore, during good behavior, but at her will and pleasure.\r\nAnother right, as dear to Englishmen as life itself, was taken from\r\nthem,--to wit, the right of trial by jury; which gave every person,\r\ngreat or small, suspected or known to be guilty of any crime against\r\nthe laws of the land, the privilege of a speedy trial, in open court,\r\nin the place where the crime may have been committed, and by a jury of\r\nhonest and impartial men. Instead of this, the person accused was to\r\nbe taken aboard some ship-of-war, likely as not a thousand miles from\r\nChristian land, and there tried by some authorities of the navy, who\r\nwould know but little, and must needs care still less, concerning the\r\nperson under trial, or his offence.\r\n\r\nUnder these and many other oppressions and injuries, the young\r\nColonies groaned grievously. But, for all that, they were not to be\r\nsubdued or broken. Time and again, they sent petitions to this\r\nunkindest and wilfulest of mothers, beseeching her, in humble and\r\nloving and dutiful terms, to remove this degrading burden from their\r\nshoulders, and once more receive them as children into her maternal\r\nbosom; warning her, at the same time, of what must be the melancholy\r\nconsequences, if she hearkened not to their prayers. Then was the\r\ntime, if ever, when, by a few kind words betokening a desire for\r\nreconciliation, she might have secured and made fast the love of these\r\ndevoted and affectionate children for ever; and, had she been as wise\r\nas she was powerful, even so would she have done. But, like the Egypt\r\nof olden times, she did but harden her heart against them all the\r\nmore, even to the hardness of the nether mill-stone; and only sought\r\nhow she could the more easily grind them into obedience and\r\nsubmission. She had grown to be mighty among the nations, this\r\nBritannia. Her armed legions told of her power by land; her ships of\r\nwar and her ships of commerce whitened a hundred seas. The great sun,\r\nthat set on every kingdom of the known earth, she boasted never went\r\ndown on her dominion. Wherefore was she swollen and big with pride,\r\nand from a high place looked haughtily down upon the little nations at\r\nher feet. What height of presumption was it, then, in these\r\ninsignificant young Colonies, struggling for bare existence off there\r\non the uttermost edges of the civilized earth, thus to lift themselves\r\nagainst her sovereign will, and dare dispute her high decrees! It was\r\nnot to be borne: she would humble them for this presumption, chastise\r\nthem for their disobedience, and show them what a terrible thing it\r\nwas to provoke her wrath. Her heart thus steeled to mercy, she stayed\r\nnot her hand, but sent her hosts of armed men in her fleets of armed\r\nships, to lay her heavy yoke, and fit it firm and fast on the necks of\r\nher rebellious children.\r\n\r\nBeholding this, and that it were vain to hope for reconciliation, the\r\nColonies, with one voice, with one indignant voice, exclaimed, \"Now,\r\nsince our mother seems bent on treating us as slaves and strangers,\r\nand not as children, then are we compelled, in our own defence, to\r\ntreat her, not as our mother, but as a stranger and our enemy. And\r\nbear us witness, O ye nations! how long and humbly and earnestly we\r\nhave prayed that there should be love and peace between us and this\r\nour mother; and bear us witness also, that, although we now lift our\r\nrebellious hand against her, there is no hatred in our hearts, even\r\nnow, but rather sorrow unspeakable, that she should at last have\r\ndriven us to this saddest, this direfulest of alternatives.\" Then,\r\nmoved with one spirit (that of the love of freedom), and bent on one\r\npurpose (that of the defence of their sacred rights), they rose in\r\ntheir young strength, and, commending their just cause to the God of\r\nhosts, made that last appeal,--which, to a brave and virtuous people,\r\nhas ever been the last,--the appeal to arms. And so they did, while\r\nthe nations looked on in wonder and applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF THE QUARREL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, my children, I must tell you, in other and perhaps plainer words,\r\nwhat these measures were that led to such momentous results, why\r\nresorted to, how carried out, and by whom.\r\n\r\nFrom what you have just been told, you can have no difficulty in\r\nguessing that Great Britain was desperately in debt, and in the very\r\nmood to resort to desperate measures of delivering herself therefrom.\r\nHer being in this particular mood at that particular time (for it is\r\nonly now and then that she has shown herself so unamiable) was owing\r\nchiefly to the fact, that she was just then under the rule, or rather\r\nmisrule, of that narrow-minded, short-sighted, hard-fisted,\r\nwrong-headed man, who commonly goes in history by the name of King\r\nGeorge the Third. Had he been the superintendent of a town workhouse,\r\nhe might perhaps have acquitted himself respectably enough; or, if I\r\nmay be so bold, he might have served a life-term as Governor of London\r\nTower, and gone to his grave without any great discredit or reproach:\r\nbut, in all human reason and justice, he certainly had no more\r\nbusiness on the throne of England than your Uncle Juvinell himself.\r\nHis ministers, who were of his own choosing, were vultures, of the\r\nsame harsh, unsightly plumage, and, at his beck or nod, stood ready to\r\ndo whatever knave's work he might have on hand,--even to the grinding\r\nof his people's bones to make his bread, should his royal appetite\r\nturn that way.\r\n\r\nWith such men at the helm of State, it is no wonder, then, that unwise\r\nand oppressive measures should be resorted to for raising money, or,\r\nas it is more properly called in such cases, a revenue, for paying the\r\ndebts and keeping up the expenses of the government. The first pounce\r\nthey made was on their young Colonies in America, whom they sought to\r\nburden with heavy taxes laid on exports, or articles of commerce sent\r\nout of the country, and on imports, or articles of commerce brought\r\ninto the country. The principal articles thus taxed were paper,\r\npainters' colors, glass, sugar and molasses, and tea. The tax-money or\r\nrevenue scraped together from the sale of these articles--and which\r\nmade them dearer to him who bought and him who sold, according to the\r\namount of duty laid on--was to be gathered into the public treasury\r\nfor the purposes aforesaid. Another plan for raising revenue, hit upon\r\nby these ingenious kites, was that famous one called the \"Stamp Act,\"\r\nthe design of which was to compel the people of the Colonies, in order\r\nto make their business transactions good and valid, to use a certain\r\nkind of paper, having on it a certain stamp. Each kind of paper had\r\nits own particular stamp, and could only be applied to a certain\r\npurpose specified thereon. Thus there was a deed stamp-paper, the will\r\nstamp-paper, the note-of-hand and bill-of-exchange stamp-paper, the\r\nmarriage stamp-paper; and, in short, stamp-paper for every concern in\r\nlife requiring an instrument of writing. The paper itself was\r\naltogether a commodity of the government, by whom it was manufactured,\r\nand sold at prices varying from a few pence up to many pounds sterling\r\nof good, hard English money, just according to the magnitude or nature\r\nof the business in hand. Had it gone into effect, it must needs have\r\nborne on the dead as well as on the living: for, if the last will and\r\ntestament of a deceased and lamented relative were not written on\r\npaper with the proper stamp, it could not have been good and valid in\r\nthe king's eyes; and this would have led to grievous misunderstandings\r\nbetween the bereaved and affectionate heirs, and perhaps the deceased\r\nhimself, in consequence, would have slept uneasily in his grave.\r\n\r\nAnother oppressive measure--the design whereof, however, was for\r\nsaving money, rather than for raising revenue--was that of quartering\r\ntroops upon the country in time of peace; by which means they must\r\nneeds be supported to a great extent by the people so sponged upon.\r\n\r\nBut the most brilliant stroke of all was an act forbidding the\r\nColonies from trading with any foreign ports, and from manufacturing\r\ncertain articles, lest the value and sale of the same articles\r\nmanufactured in England, and to be sold in America, might be lowered\r\nor hindered thereby.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned, how that the right of choosing their judges\r\nand other civil officers, and the right of trial by jury, had been\r\ntaken from them,--measures that had a meanness and odium quite their\r\nown; as serving no end of profit, but merely as safety-valves, through\r\nwhich the royal bile might find vent now and then.\r\n\r\nNow, the good people of the Colonies, as I have hinted elsewhere,\r\nwould not have raised the hue and outcry that they did against these\r\nmeasures, had it not been for one thing, which to them, as Englishmen,\r\nwas all in all; to wit, the right of taxing themselves, and\r\nlegislating or making laws for themselves through persons of their own\r\nchoosing, called representatives. And this is, my little folks, what\r\nis meant by taxation, and legislation by representation, in a nation.\r\nYou will do well to bear this in mind continually; for it is the very\r\nkeystone to the arch of all true government.\r\n\r\nThis right of representation, however, was denied them; for what\r\nearthly reason, no one, not in the secret, could imagine. As the king\r\nhimself was never able to render a reason for any thing he did, his\r\nministers would not for any thing they did, and the parliament dared\r\nnot for any thing they did.\r\n\r\nWhat could they do, then, but send petitions to the king, and\r\nremonstrances to the parliament, complaining of, and crying out\r\nagainst, their many grievances, and deploring and demanding that they\r\nbe removed and redressed. Although they did this with more dignity and\r\nrespectfulness, with more clearness and ability, than the like thing\r\nhad ever been done before, or has been since, by any people, yet their\r\npetitions were spurned by the king, because they were just and manly,\r\nand he was not; and their remonstrances went unheeded by the\r\nparliament, because they were wise and reasonable, and it was not.\r\n\r\nFailing to get redress for their grievances, the colonists resolved\r\nthat the source of these same grievances should not be a source of\r\nprofit to those who imposed them. To bring about this result, they, as\r\none man, entered into what was called the \"non-importation\r\nagreement,\"--or, in other words, an agreement by which they solemnly\r\npledged themselves to abstain from the use of all articles burdened\r\nwith a tax, until such tax should be removed; and, furthermore, that\r\nthey would not buy or use any thing that they were forbidden to\r\nmanufacture themselves; and, still furthermore, that not a ship of\r\ntheirs should trade with British ports, until the act forbidding them\r\nto trade with foreign ports should be repealed. Some of them, I dare\r\nsay, would have gone so far, had that been possible, as to pledge\r\nthemselves not to die, until the Stamp Act, compelling them to write\r\ntheir wills on stamp-paper, was also repealed. This agreement was so\r\nrigidly observed, that the men took to wearing jeans, and the women\r\nlinsey-woolseys, which they wove in their own looms; the old ladies\r\ndrank sassafras-tea, sweetened with maple-sugar; and old gentlemen\r\nwrote no wills, but declared them on their death-bed to their weeping\r\nfamilies by word of mouth. Whether the people stopped marrying or not,\r\nit is not known with certainty; but from my knowledge of human nature,\r\nwhich is extensive, I do not think I should greatly hazard my\r\nreputation as a historian, were I to state flatly, roundly, and\r\nemphatically, that it had not the least effect in that way.\r\n\r\nThe days on which these measures were to go into effect were observed\r\nby the colonists as days of fasting, prayer, and humiliation. All\r\nbusiness was laid aside, the shops were closed, the churches opened,\r\nand the church-bells tolled as on some funeral occasion; and between\r\npraying at church, and fasting at home, and brooding over their\r\ngrievances, the good people were very miserable indeed. Although they\r\nsuffered great inconvenience from their observance of the\r\nnon-importation agreement, yet they bore it patiently and cheerfully,\r\nlike men who felt that their cause was just and right. But the sudden\r\nstoppage of the immense trade that flowed from the colonial ports into\r\nthose of the mother-country told dreadfully on the commerce of Great\r\nBritain; and British merchants and British manufacturers, and British\r\npeople in general, soon began to suffer even more than the colonists\r\nthemselves. Whereupon, a counter stream of petitions and remonstrances\r\nset in upon the king and parliament from the people at home, who\r\ndeclared that the country would be ruined, if these odious measures,\r\ncrippling American commerce, were not speedily withdrawn. Said they,\r\n\"If we cannot sell the Americans our broadcloths, our flannels, and\r\nour silks, the obstinate men of that country will stick to their\r\njeans, and the perverse women to their linsey-woolseys, till we are\r\nundone for ever. In that one pestilent little town of Boston, our\r\ntrade in silks alone is not so good by fifty thousand dollars a year\r\nas it has been heretofore: and we humbly entreat that our American\r\nbrothers be allowed to trade with us and foreign nations as in days\r\ngone by; for you must see by this time with your own eyes, that we, as\r\na nation, are growing poorer every day under this state of things,\r\ninstead of richer every year as had been expected.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners--that is to say, the persons who had been appointed\r\nby the British Government to bring or receive the stamp-paper, and\r\ngive it circulation throughout the Colonies--were mobbed and pelted by\r\nthe indignant people, whenever and wherever they made the least\r\nattempt to do their odious work. In consequence of this determined\r\nopposition, the paper never went into circulation: so it was stocked\r\naway in outhouses, and there left to mould and to be eaten by rats and\r\nmice, if their stomachs were not too dainty for such vile provender.\r\nThus this famous piece of ingenuity, the Stamp Act, had no other\r\neffect than that of giving the civilized world a hearty laugh, and\r\nincreasing the British debt just so much as the paper cost, instead of\r\nlessening it, as its inventors, in their blind confidence, had hoped.\r\n\r\nBeholding how utterly had failed all their pet schemes for raising\r\nrevenue, the narrow-minded king, and the king-minded ministry, and the\r\nmany-minded parliament, were, so to speak, thrown on their haunches,\r\nand forced to eat their own folly; which, I dare say, they found less\r\npalatable than their roast beef and plum-pudding. In other words, they\r\nrepealed the Stamp Act; with one stroke of the royal pen, struck off\r\nthe taxes laid on the above-mentioned articles; and once more gave the\r\nColonies full liberty to manufacture whatsoever, and re-open\r\ncommercial intercourse with whomsoever, they chose. And thus this\r\nnon-importation agreement worked like a charm: it brought about in a\r\ntrice what petitions and remonstrances had failed to accomplish in\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen tidings came of what had been done at home, there was great\r\nrejoicing throughout the provinces: the church-bells were tolled to\r\nanother tune than that with which they had been tolled a short time\r\nbefore; the good people met at church, but this time to give thanks;\r\nand went home, not to fast, but to feast; and were now quite as\r\ncomfortable as they had before been miserable. But I have gone a\r\nlittle too far, however. There was one circumstance that greatly\r\ndampened the general feeling of joy, and made a mere thanksgiving of\r\nwhat might else have been a high-sounding jubilee. This was the tax on\r\ntea, which had not been struck off along with the rest, but had been\r\nsuffered to remain; not that any great revenue was expected to arise\r\ntherefrom, but simply to show that they--the king and parliament--had\r\nnot disclaimed or yielded up the right to tax and burden the Colonies\r\nwhen and how they thought fit and proper. This vexed the American\r\npeople sorely; for though the bulk of the nuisance had been taken\r\naway, yet all the odor still remained: or, speaking more plainly, the\r\nright of laying such burdens on themselves, of their own free will,\r\nwas still denied them; and this, in fact, was the very thing that made\r\nit so intolerable for them to bear. \"Is it,\" said Washington in a\r\nletter to a friend, \"the duty of threepence per pound upon tea that we\r\nobject to as burdensome? No; but it is the right to lay this duty upon\r\nourselves for which we contend.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, as far as the commodity tea was concerned, the people of\r\nthe Colonies still observed the non-importation agreement. From some\r\nof the ports, the ships that had come over from England laden with\r\nthis delightful plant were sent back, without being suffered to\r\ndischarge their cargoes; in others, where it had been landed, it was\r\nnot allowed to be sold, but was stowed away in cellars and the like\r\nout-of-the-way places, where it moulded, or became the food of rats\r\nand mice, whose bowels, if we may trust the testimony of some of our\r\ngreat-grandmothers, were so bound up thereby, that a terrible\r\nmortality set in among them, that swept them away by cart-loads.\r\n\r\nNow, the East-India Company, to whom had been granted the sole\r\nprivilege of trading in tea for the space of a hundred years, if I\r\nremember rightly, were greatly alarmed at the consequences of the\r\ntea-tax. Enormous quantities of the article had begun to accumulate in\r\ntheir London warehouses, now that there was no market for it in\r\nAmerica, which hitherto had fed the purse in their left-hand pocket,\r\nas did that in Great Britain the larger one in their right-hand\r\npocket. \"Something must be done,\" said they to themselves (they\r\ncertainly said it to nobody else),--\"something must be done, or these\r\nhigh-spirited women of America will drink their wishy-washy sassafras\r\ntill their blood be no thicker than whey, and the purse in our\r\nleft-hand pocket become as light and lean and lank as when we sent our\r\nfirst ship-load thither years ago.\" This \"something to be done\" was a\r\nloud petition to parliament, praying for speedy relief from the ruin,\r\nwhich has an uncomfortable fashion of staring at great mercantile\r\ncompanies, and was now staring them full in the face.\r\n\r\nSo, putting their heads together, the king and parliament hit upon an\r\ningenious plan, by which they, the East-India Company, could sell\r\ntheir tea, and the government collect the duty thereon. It was this:\r\nThe price of the article should be so far reduced, that it would be\r\nlower, even with the duty on it, than, at the usual rate of sale,\r\nwithout any duty at all. This was a brilliant scheme indeed, and would\r\nhave succeeded to admiration, had the good people of America been a\r\nnation of bats and geese; but, as they were not, the scheme failed\r\ndisgracefully, as you shall presently see.\r\n\r\nBy way of giving this plan a trial, a few ships loaded with tea were\r\nsent over to Boston, where they lay for some time in the harbor,\r\nwithout being permitted by the people to land their cargoes. One day,\r\nas if to show the king and ministers and parliament, the East-India\r\nCompany, and the whole British nation, that they, the Americans, were,\r\nand had been from the very beginning, desperately in earnest in all\r\nthat they had said and done for years past, a party, composed of about\r\nfifty of the most sober and respectable citizens of Boston and the\r\ncountry around, disguised themselves as Indians, and went aboard these\r\nships. Not a word was to be heard among them; but, keeping a grim and\r\nominous silence, they ranged the vessel from stem to stern, ransacked\r\ntheir cargoes, broke open the tea-chests, and, pouring their contents\r\ninto the sea, made the fishes a dish of tea, which is said to have had\r\nthe same effect on them as on the rats and mice. This done with\r\nperfect coolness and sobriety, the party returned to their homes as\r\norderly and silent as they had come; not the first movement towards a\r\nmob or tumult having been made by the people during the whole\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nThis affair, commonly known in history as the Boston Tea-party, and\r\nwhich took place in 1774, overwhelmed his majesty with stupid\r\nastonishment, threw his ministers into fits of foaming rage, fell like\r\na thunder-clap upon the House of Parliament, and effectually\r\ndemolished the last forlorn hope of the East-India Company. The spirit\r\nof resistance on the part of the Colonies had now been carried to such\r\na length, that the home-government determined to send over the\r\nmilitary to awe them by the terror of its presence into obedience to\r\ntheir unreasonable and oppressive demands; and, should not this be\r\nfound sufficient, to compel them into submission by the force of its\r\narms.\r\n\r\nOh, woful, woful, that ever a tyrant should live to keep his\r\ndragon-watch on the birth of the free-born thought, the independent\r\nwish, and ere the full, clear light of heaven descend upon it, warming\r\nit into strength and beauty, to seize and crush it into slavish fear,\r\nand love and justice without power to stay his impious hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nRESISTANCE TO TYRANNY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith what deep and earnest interest Washington watched the course of\r\nthese momentous events may be readily imagined, if we reflect how much\r\nof his life had been already spent in the service of the public, and\r\nhow near he had ever kept the good and welfare of his native land at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe was not a mere looker-on, but one of those who had in the very\r\nbeginning shown themselves ready to enter, heart and hand and fortune,\r\ninto all just and lawful measures of resistance to oppression in every\r\nshape and form; but, with his usual modesty, forbearing to push\r\nhimself forward, which served, no doubt, to add to his example still\r\ngreater weight and influence, and make it all the more illustrious. He\r\nrigidly observed the non-importation agreement, and was, in fact, one\r\nof the first to propose its adoption; and none of the articles therein\r\nnamed were to be seen in his house until the odious burdens laid\r\nthereon had been removed.\r\n\r\nLittle or no lasting good, however, could be expected from these, or\r\nindeed any measures, unless the Colonies should come to a clearer and\r\nfuller understanding, one with another, touching the troubles that\r\nconcerned all equally and alike. To bring this much-to-be-wished-for\r\nend about, it was resolved that a general assembly of all the Colonies\r\nshould be called, wherein each province, through its representatives\r\nchosen by the people thereof, should have a voice. As the first step\r\ntowards this object, conventions were summoned in the various\r\nprovinces, the members whereof had the authority to choose from among\r\ntheir number those who were to be their representatives or\r\nmouth-pieces in this great Colonial Assembly, since known in history\r\nas the Old Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry (the great American orator), Mr. Pendleton, and\r\nWashington were those appointed to represent Virginia. Accordingly,\r\nabout the middle of September, 1774, these three Congress-men set out\r\ntogether on horseback for Philadelphia, the place of meeting. Arrived\r\nhere, Washington found assembled the first talent, wisdom, and virtue\r\nof the land. It was to him a sublime spectacle indeed,--that of the\r\npeople of many widely separated provinces thus met together to give\r\nvoice and expression to what they felt to be their sacred rights as\r\nfreemen and free Englishmen. To add still greater solemnity to their\r\nproceedings, and give their cause the stamp of the just and righteous\r\ncause they felt it to be, it was resolved to open the business of each\r\nday with prayer. Next morning, there came a report that Boston had\r\nbeen cannonaded by the king's troops, who had been stationed there for\r\nmany weeks past. Although this afterwards turned out to be false, yet,\r\nat the time, it had a most beneficial effect, in drawing still nearer\r\ntogether those who but the day before had met as strangers, by\r\nimpressing their minds with a still deeper sense of the sacredness of\r\nthe trust imposed on them by their country, and by bringing more\r\ndirectly home to them their common danger, and dependence one upon\r\nanother. The minister, before offering up his prayer, took up the\r\nBible to read a passage therefrom, and, as if providentially, opened\r\nat the thirty-fifth Psalm, which seemed to have been written expressly\r\nfor this great occasion, and began thus: \"Plead my cause, O Lord, with\r\nthem that strive with me; fight against them that fight against me.\"\r\nWhat wonder, then, that, under circumstances like these, they should\r\nfeel their hearts joined together in stronger, holier bonds of union,\r\nas they knelt side by side on that memorable morning, commending their\r\njust cause to the Ruler of nations? For several minutes after they had\r\nresumed their seats, a profound and solemn silence reigned throughout\r\nthe house; each looking the other in the face, as if uncertain how to\r\nset about the great work that had brought them together, and no one\r\nwilling to open the Assembly. The silence was becoming painful and\r\nembarrassing; when Patrick Henry at length arose, and began addressing\r\nthe House, at first in a faltering voice and hesitating manner, which\r\nsoon, however, as he warmed with his subject, gave place to a bolder,\r\nhigher strain, till, long before he had ended, the hearts of his\r\nhearers were thrilled with a flow of eloquence, the like of which none\r\npresent had ever heard before; and, when it ceased, each felt that he\r\nhad just been listening to the greatest orator, not of Virginia only,\r\nbut of all America. The burden of his declamation was the oppressive\r\nand unlawful system of taxation devised by Great Britain against her\r\nAmerican Colonies; the severe restriction laid on their commerce; the\r\nabolition of the right of trial by jury, and of choosing their own\r\njudges; the danger that must ever threaten their liberties, if they\r\nsuffered troops of war to be quartered upon them in times of peace;\r\nand, above all, that they should be denied the right of taxing\r\nthemselves, of making their own laws, and of regulating their internal\r\nconcerns, as seemed to their judgment wise and proper, through\r\nrepresentatives of their own choosing. To get redress for these and\r\nsimilar grievances, was the chief, and, I may say, the only object for\r\nwhich this first Congress had been called; for at that time, and for a\r\nlong time after, no one harbored such a thought as that of breaking\r\nwith the mother-country, with a view of achieving their independence.\r\nTo this end, they now applied themselves with deep and sober\r\nearnestness, and brought to their work all the resources that their\r\nwisdom and experience could command.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Old Continental Congress lasted fifty-one\r\ndays. Such was the decorum with which they conducted their\r\nproceedings, such the eloquence, force, and precision with which they\r\nset forth their grievances, such the temperate and dignified tone that\r\nmarked their petitions to the king, and such the manliness, firmness,\r\nand unwavering constancy with which they persisted in battling for\r\ntheir right as freemen to be represented in the councils of the\r\nnation, that thousands of their brothers across the Atlantic were\r\nfilled with wonder and admiration. And here, for once and for all, be\r\nit known to you, my dear children, and, in justice to the British\r\nnation as a people, never fail hereafter to bear it in mind, that\r\nthere were many, very many, perhaps a large majority, of our English\r\nuncles, who deeply sympathized with our fathers in their troubles, and\r\nheartily condemned the oppressive burdens heaped upon them by the king\r\nand his ministers. Even in the House of Parliament itself were there\r\nmany of the greatest spirits of that age, who had all along opposed\r\nthese harsh and unjust measures of the government towards the\r\nColonies, and were now so impressed with all that marked the\r\nproceedings of this first Colonial Congress, that they exerted\r\nthemselves in behalf of their oppressed brothers in America with more\r\nzeal than ever before, and pleaded their cause in strains of eloquence\r\nthat shall ring in our ears, and dwell in our hearts, till history\r\nshall tell us we have ceased to be a nation.\r\n\r\nAnd well indeed they might admire and praise; for what with the\r\neloquence of such men as Henry and Rutledge, the learning of such men\r\nas Hancock and Adams, the wisdom of such men as Washington, and the\r\npure and exalted character of them all, it was a body of men, the like\r\nof which had never before assembled together in any age or country.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, upon being asked who was the greatest man in the\r\nCongress, replied, \"If you speak of eloquence, Mr. Rutledge, of South\r\nCarolina, is by far the greatest orator; but, if you speak of solid\r\ninformation and sound judgment, Col. Washington is, beyond all\r\nquestion, the greatest man on that floor.\" Had Mr. Rutledge been asked\r\nthe same question, he would as readily have pronounced Patrick Henry\r\nthe greatest orator, as indeed he was.\r\n\r\nBent on one common object, encompassed by dangers that threatened all\r\nalike, and glowing with the same ardent and heroic spirit, they seemed\r\nfor the time to have quite forgotten that they were the natives and\r\nrepresentatives of many different and widely separated provinces, and\r\nto think that they were, as Patrick Henry happily expressed it, not\r\nCarolinians, not Pennsylvanians, not Virginians, so much as that they\r\nwere Americans; and had been sent there, not so much to represent the\r\nwill and wishes of the people of their respective provinces, as of\r\nthose of the whole American people. Thus Union became the watchword\r\nthroughout the Colonies. And by union alone were they able to make a\r\nstand against tyranny; by it alone came off victorious in the end; by\r\nit alone won for themselves a place among the nations; and by it alone\r\ncan their posterity hope to hold that place as a powerful, free, and\r\nhappy people.\r\n\r\nHaving done all that could be done for the present, the Congress was\r\nadjourned, and the members returned to their homes to await the result\r\nof the petitions and remonstrances they had sent on to the king and\r\nparliament. Although these were couched in moderate and respectful\r\nterms, expressing their unaltered attachment to the king and his\r\nfamily, deploring that there should be aught but peace and good-will\r\nbetween them, and entreating him not to drive his children to the\r\ndreadful alternative of taking up arms in their defence, yet, like\r\nthose that had gone before them, they were received with contempt or\r\nindifference, and failed to awaken in the king's mind any sentiment of\r\nmercy, or desire on the part of the parliament for reconciliation with\r\ntheir younger brothers in America. Here was the last, the golden\r\nopportunity, wherein, by an act of simple justice, by an expression of\r\nChristian kindness, they might have won back to obedience and love\r\nthis much-injured people; but under the mistaken and fatal belief\r\nthat they were all-powerful, and that, if they yielded up these\r\npretended rights, the colonists would never rest until they had thrown\r\noff and trampled under foot all authority, they suffered it to pass\r\nunheeded, lost for ever.\r\n\r\nA short time after the adjournment of Congress, at a second Virginia\r\nConvention, held at Richmond, Patrick Henry, in closing one of the\r\ngrandest efforts he ever made, thus boldly declared his mind: \"The\r\ntime of reconciliation is past; the time for action is at hand. It is\r\nuseless to send further petitions to the government, or to await the\r\nresult of those already addressed to the throne. We must fight, Mr.\r\nSpeaker: I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the\r\nGod of hosts is all that is left us!\" The great orator did but give\r\nvoice to the feelings and sentiments of thousands of pure patriots,\r\namong whom was Washington, who represented his district in this\r\nconvention also. No one regretted more sincerely than he that they\r\nwere thus compelled to take up the sword as the only remedy of their\r\nwrongs and grievances. In his own mind, he had fully resolved, if\r\nneedful, to devote his life and fortune to the cause; and was willing,\r\nhe told his brother, to arm and equip a thousand men at his own\r\nexpense, and lead them to the succor of Boston, at that time blockaded\r\nby the British fleet. Grave and thoughtful, and pondering deeply all\r\nthese things, he went to his home; and, in this frame of mind, the\r\nwinter months passed slowly by.\r\n\r\nIt was now apparent to all, that open hostilities between the Colonies\r\nand the mother-country were no longer avoidable; and on the nineteenth\r\nof April, 1775, the battle of Lexington announced to the world that\r\nthe first blood of a desperate struggle had been shed, and that civil\r\nwar, with all its train of horrors, had begun.\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings reached Mount Vernon, the impressions made on\r\nWashington's mind were solemn and profound, if we may judge from a\r\nletter written at the time, in which he says, \"Unhappy it is to\r\nreflect, that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's\r\nbreast, and that the once-peaceful plains of America are to be\r\ndrenched with blood, or inhabited by slaves. Sad alternative! But can\r\na virtuous man hesitate in his choice?\" Early in May, as he was just\r\non the eve of setting out for Philadelphia to take his seat in the\r\nsecond session of the Congress, news reached him of the capture of\r\nTiconderoga by Col. Ethan Allen. It was a brilliant little exploit\r\nenough, and the very kind to raise undue expectations in the many, who\r\nlooked no further into the future than to-night, when it is yet\r\nevening; but it could have no other effect than to deepen the\r\nthoughtfulness of a mind like Washington's, that could look through\r\nthe glare of these accidental hits of war, and behold the untried\r\nperils still further beyond.\r\n\r\nAs the war had now begun in earnest, so dreaded and deeply deplored by\r\nall the good men, as the only remedy left to their distress, the\r\ndeliberations of the second Congress turned chiefly on the devising of\r\nmeans for their defence and safety. Towards this object, nothing\r\neffectual could be done till some person was fixed upon to be the\r\nleader of the army, which they had yet, in large measure, to raise,\r\narm, and equip.\r\n\r\nThere were not a few, who, for age, talent, experience, fortune, and\r\nsocial position, as well as for the sacrifices they had already made\r\nto the cause, were, in the opinion of their friends, and perhaps in\r\nthat of their own, justly entitled to this high distinction. After\r\nsome time spent in viewing the matter in all its bearings, and\r\ncarefully weighing the claims of each, without being able to fix upon\r\na choice, John Adams decided the question by addressing the House to\r\nthe following effect: That the person intrusted with a place of such\r\nimportance to Americans must be a native-born American; a man of large\r\nfortune, in order to give him a strong personal interest in the issue\r\nof the contest, and the means of carrying it on; he should be a man of\r\nmilitary experience, and accustomed to the government of large bodies\r\nof men; he should be of tried integrity and patriotism, of great\r\ncourage and bodily endurance, and known ability; and a resident of\r\nsome central province, that in him might be blended the extreme\r\ninterests of North and South, which would tend to lessen the\r\njealousies of the two sections, and harmonize them, as it were, into\r\none. Such a province was Virginia, and such a man was Col. Washington;\r\nwhom, therefore, he commended to the favor and consideration of the\r\nHonorable House.\r\n\r\nBefore this address was ended, Washington, perceiving that he was the\r\nperson on the point of being singled out, rose from his seat, much\r\nagitated and embarrassed, and hastily quitted the House.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Mr. Adams's recommendation was acted upon; and the\r\nHouse, without a single dissenting voice, chose GEORGE WASHINGTON to\r\nbe _Commander-in-chief_ of all the army of the United Colonies, with\r\nthe salary of six thousand dollars a year. In his reply, Washington\r\nexpressed his grateful sense of so signal a proof of the confidence\r\nreposed in him by his countrymen, and added,--\r\n\r\n     \"But lest some unfortunate event should happen, unfavorable to\r\n     my reputation, I beg that it may be remembered by every\r\n     gentleman in this room, that I this day declare, with the\r\n     utmost sincerity, that I do not think myself equal to the\r\n     command I am honored with. As to pay, I beg leave to assure the\r\n     Congress, that, as no pecuniary consideration could have\r\n     tempted me to accept of this employment at the expense of my\r\n     domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit\r\n     of it. I will keep an exact account of my expenses: these, I\r\n     doubt not, they will discharge; and that is all I desire.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mrs. Washington, informing her of the great change thus\r\nmade in his destiny, he deplores the hard necessity that makes it his\r\nduty to give up the sweet pleasures of home and her society; and\r\nexhorts her, in affectionate language, to bear up under their\r\nseparation with cheerfulness and fortitude; at the same time giving\r\nher the gratifying assurance, that with her he could have more\r\nhappiness at Mount Vernon in one month, than he could hope to find\r\nwithout her, were he to remain abroad seven times seven years. From\r\nthe tone of this letter, she must readily have guessed that the place\r\nwas not one of his own seeking.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 21st of June, General Washington,--for so we must\r\nnow call him,--having received his commission, set out to take command\r\nof the American army, then lying before Boston, which, being occupied\r\nby the king's troops, was in a state of siege. A company of\r\nPennsylvania light-horse escorted him from Philadelphia to New York,\r\nwhere he was received with all the honor due, not only to the high\r\nstation he had been called to fill, but also to his exalted character\r\nand distinguished abilities. Here he heard further particulars of the\r\nbattle of Bunker's Hill, fought near Boston a few days before. From\r\nNew York, the general-in-chief proceeded to Boston, and was greeted\r\neverywhere on the way with the greatest enthusiasm by the people, who\r\ncame streaming in from all quarters to behold the man into whose\r\nkeeping had been intrusted the destinies of America.\r\n\r\nThus, my dear children, I have brought you, step by step, up to that\r\ngreat event in Washington's life when his character and actions were\r\nto be subjected to the gaze and scrutiny, not only of his own age and\r\ncountry, but of all ages to come, and of all the nations of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Juvinell paused, and, with a countenance of undisturbed\r\nsobriety, emptied his ninth mug. In justice, however, to the good man,\r\nthis pattern of old-fashioned gentility, it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat the mug was a Dutch mug, and consequently a small one (as indeed\r\nare all things Dutch, from clocks to cheeses); and also that, small as\r\nit was, he never more than half filled it, except once or twice in the\r\ncourse of an evening, when he would gird up his loins, as it were,\r\nwith a brimmer to help him over some passage in his story of unusual\r\nknottiness and difficulty.\r\n\r\nWillie (whose surname should have been fox or weasel or lynx), having\r\nheretofore divided his attention between what his uncle imparted and\r\nwhat he imbibed, had, by careful counting, discovered that the ninth\r\nmug invariably closed their evening lessons: so, without waiting for\r\nany further signal that such was now the case, he alertly bounced from\r\nhis chair, and, snatching up a basket of big red apples that black\r\ndaddy had just brought in and set on the hearth, began handing them\r\nround to the rest of the company with a great show of playing the\r\npolite and obliging, but taking care, when unobserved, to pick out the\r\nlargest and mellowest one of them all for himself, and smuggle it\r\nunder his coat-tail. When all were helped, he reset the basket on the\r\nhearth, and with a grand flourish, unmasking his royal red, opened\r\nwide his mouth, as if he would have bolted it whole: but, seeming to\r\nthink better of it, he carefully laid it in Uncle Juvinell's mug,\r\nwhich it exactly filled, saying as he did so, \"It goes to my heart to\r\npart with you; but only the king of historians is worthy to enjoy the\r\nqueen of apples.\" Then, plunging his hand into the basket, he snatched\r\nup another, hap-hazard, and began eating it with savage voracity, as\r\nif made reckless by this act of self-denial. Re-seating himself as he\r\nhad chosen his apple, hap-hazard, he missed his chair, and keeled\r\nover, bringing his heels in the air where his head should have been,\r\nand his head on the rug where the dog and cat were, and the\r\nhalf-munched plug in his mouth, plump into his windpipe, so as to\r\nalmost strangle him out of his breeches, and cause his buttons to fly\r\nlike grains from a corn-cob when thrown into a corn-sheller. Of\r\ncourse, all the little folks fairly screamed with laughter, in which\r\neven Uncle Juvinell could not help joining right heartily: nor would\r\nhe venture upon the broad wedge which he had cut out of his apple,\r\ntill his chuckle was well ended; when he remarked, that \"Willie was\r\none of the boys we read about.\" To which Willie, picking himself up\r\nagain, replied, that \"he rather thought he was not, just then, but\r\nperhaps would be as soon as he could get back some of the breath he\r\nhad lost, and gather up the buttons he had shed.\" Then, drawing down\r\nhis waistcoat from under his arm-pits to hide a breadth of white\r\nmuslin not usually intended for the eyes of a mixed company, he\r\nreseated himself with such care and circumspection, that the middle\r\nseam of his breeches tallied exactly with the middle round of the\r\nchair-back, and began mincing and nibbling his apple delicately like a\r\nsheep, as if to show that he meant to profit by the lesson his fit of\r\nstrangling had taught him.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, when he saw that the children had had their fill\r\nof laughter and red apples, Uncle Juvinell wiped the blade of his\r\nknife with his bandanna, and said, \"And now, my darlings, don't you\r\nthink we are getting along swimmingly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swimmingly!\" they all chimed in with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"Gloriously?\" again inquired Uncle Juvinell.\r\n\r\n\"Gloriously!\" cried all the children at once, as pat to their uncle's\r\nwords as an echo to the sound. Whereupon the old gentleman's\r\nspectacles shone with a lustre that was charming to see. In a moment\r\nafter, however, Bryce, the pugnacious urchin of ten, expressed himself\r\na little disappointed that they had had so much building of forts, and\r\ndigging and cutting of roads, and so much scouting and marching, and\r\nso much getting ready to fight, and yet withal so little downright\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\"You quite forget, Bryce, that affair of Grant's defeat there at Fort\r\nDuquesne,\" said Willie. \"In my opinion, that was a very decent,\r\nrespectable piece of bloodshed; and quite as good as Braddock's\r\ndisaster, as far as it goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How heartless you must be, Willie, to speak so lightly of such\r\nhorrible things!\" exclaimed Miss Laura with a look of refined disgust.\r\n\"To my mind, Washington's courtship and wedding, and the pleasant life\r\nhe led at Mount Vernon, are more entertaining than all your dismal\r\nbattles.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those charming barge-rides by moonlight,\" chimed in Ella, \"that\r\nthe old Virginia planters used to take when they visited each other up\r\nand down the Potomac.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome to your courtships and your weddings and your\r\nboat-rides by moonlight,\" cried Willie, turning up his nose; \"but I\r\nwould not have given a good fox-hunt with old Lord Fairfax for any of\r\nthem: and what a glorious fellow Washington must have been, with his\r\nfine horses and his fine dogs, and his jumping twenty-one feet seven\r\ninches at a bound!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Willie! how can you be so wanting in respect as to call such a\r\nman as Washington '_fellow_'?\" exclaimed Laura, with a look of pious\r\nhorror. \"I am astonished at you!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I said he was glorious; didn't I now, Miss Over-nice?\" retorted\r\nWillie.\r\n\r\n\"Your Cousin Laura, William, is quite right in what she says,\"\r\nobserved Uncle Juvinell, with something like severity in his look and\r\ntone. \"We should never speak of the good and great in other terms than\r\nthose of esteem and reverence; for the effect of such a habit is to\r\ncultivate in ourselves those very qualities of mind and heart which\r\nmake them worthy of our love and admiration.\"\r\n\r\nWillie was somewhat abashed by this mild rebuke, and apologized in a\r\ndumb way by coughing a time or two behind his slate.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" inquired Ella, \"is transcendentalism an art or a science?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can tell you what that is, Ella,\" Daniel made haste to put\r\nin; for he never let an opportunity slip of showing off what he knew\r\nto the best advantage.\r\n\r\n\"I did not call upon you for information, Mr. Wiseacre,\" said Ella, a\r\nlittle nettled at her brother's air of superior wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" cried Uncle Juvinell, \"let us listen, and be wise.\r\nCome, give us the benefit of your knowledge, Daniel, touching this\r\nimportant matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I overheard father say to you the other day,\" replied Daniel, without\r\nhesitation, \"that your transcendentalism, uncle, was an equal mixture\r\nof opium, moonshine, fog, and sick-man's dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! you have hit it exactly!\" cried Uncle Juvinell; \"and, to reward\r\nyou for your diligence in picking up and storing away such precious\r\nbits of knowledge, I promise you for your next Christmas present a\r\ngilt-edged copy of Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you very much, dear uncle,\" replied Dannie; \"but, if it makes\r\nno difference with you, I would prefer 'Josephus' to 'Bunyan.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly, my dear nephew; it shall be as you wish,\"\r\nreplied Uncle Juvinell, a little provoked with himself for having been\r\nso thoughtless as to overlook the fact, that Daniel, being a\r\ncurly-headed, Jewish boy, was not likely to be much interested in the\r\nups and downs of good old Christian's doleful pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, uncle,\" cried John, who had an ear for rhyme, \"what is meant\r\nby taxation, and legislation by representation, in a nation. Is it\r\nsense, or only poetry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad poetry, but mighty good sense, my little boy,\" replied Uncle\r\nJuvinell; \"and, if you will be right attentive, I will endeavor to\r\nmake clear to you what is meant thereby. In a popular form of\r\ngovernment,--such as the one we live under,--the people tax\r\nthemselves, and make laws for themselves, through persons chosen by\r\nthemselves, and from among themselves, to serve for a certain term of\r\nmonths or years in our State Legislatures or in our National\r\nCongress, as the case may be. The persons whom the people thus\r\nauthorize to tax them and make laws, or, as it is otherwise termed, to\r\nlegislate for them, representing, as they do, the will, desires, and\r\nwants of the communities by whom they are chosen, are called\r\nrepresentatives; and hence the phrase, 'taxation, and representation\r\nby legislation.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In a nation,\" added Johnnie, by way of giving it a finish, and to\r\nshow that it was all as clear as day to him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in a nation and a state too,\" rejoined Uncle Juvinell, with a\r\nmerry twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have the kindness, uncle,\" said Dannie, \"to tell us the\r\ndifference between a legislature and a congress and a parliament?\"\r\n\r\n\"In our own country,\" replied Uncle Juvinell, \"a legislature is the\r\nlaw-making assembly of a State, and Congress is the law-making\r\nassembly of the whole nation; while Parliament is the great law-making\r\nor legislative assembly of Great Britain and Ireland. The rules and\r\nregulations in all these bodies are quite similar; and, besides being\r\nvested with the power of laying taxes and making laws, they perform\r\nother services necessary to the safety and welfare of the state or\r\nnation. Thus the old Continental Congress was composed of\r\nrepresentatives from all the thirteen States, which entitled each,\r\nthrough its representation, to one vote, and to equal weight and\r\ninfluence with the rest, in the acts and deliberations of this\r\nassembly, no matter what may have been its size and population,\r\nwhether large or small; nor what the number of its representatives,\r\nwhether one or several.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you also tell me, uncle, wherein a convention differs from\r\nall these legislative assemblies?\" said Daniel, grappling manfully\r\nwith the tall words, but staggering under them nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"Simply not being legislative at all, as the term is now generally\r\nused in our country,\" replied Uncle Juvinell. \"A convention is a body\r\nof men assembled together as representatives of a party or state or\r\nnation, for some special purpose, such as the formation of a new State\r\nConstitution, or for making changes in an old one, or to give\r\nexpression to the views and designs of a party, and to nominate\r\ncandidates to the various offices of the government; which purpose\r\nbeing effected, they are dissolved, and cease to exist or to have any\r\nlegal force.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, uncle, was the name 'Continental' given to our first\r\nCongress?\" inquired Willie.\r\n\r\n\"To distinguish it from the Congress of the several States, and as the\r\none in which the common interest and welfare of all the States of the\r\ncontinent were represented,\" was Uncle Juvinell's reply; and then he\r\nadded, \"And hence the same term was applied to whatever belonged to\r\nthe States conjointly, and grew out of their union or confederation.\r\nThus, for example, besides the Continental Congress, there was a\r\nContinental Army, raised, equipped, and supported at the joint expense\r\nof all the States, and subject in a great measure to the control of\r\nthe Continental Congress. And there was the Continental uniform, which\r\nwas the uniform worn by an officer or a soldier of the Continental\r\nArmy. And there was the Continental currency, which was the\r\npaper-money issued and put into circulation by the Continental\r\nCongress, all the States unitedly holding themselves accountable for\r\nits redemption in specie; or, in other words, binding themselves,\r\nafter having gained their independence as a nation, to take it back at\r\nthe value specified thereon, and giving to those who held it gold and\r\nsilver in exchange. But more of this in another place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is a minister, uncle?\" inquired Laura. \"And what is a\r\ncommissioner, uncle?\" chimed in Ella. \"And what is a revenue, uncle?\"\r\nput in Charlie. \"And what is a remonstrance, uncle?\" inquired Bryce,\r\nfollowing up the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Hold, you rogues! and one at a time!\" cried Uncle Juvinell. \"A\r\nminister, Laura, in the sense in which we have been using the term, is\r\na high officer of State, intrusted with the control and management of\r\nsome office or department of the national government, such as that of\r\nthe navy or war or treasury or commerce or foreign affairs. All the\r\nministers, taken collectively, make up what is called the ministry;\r\nwho, besides discharging the duties of their respective offices, are\r\nalso expected to serve as counsellors to the king, and aid him in\r\ncarrying out the measures of the government. A commissioner, Ella, is\r\nan agent appointed and authorized by another, or a number of others,\r\nor a State, to transact some business of a private or public\r\ncharacter, as the case may be. A revenue, Charlie, is the income or\r\nyearly sum of money of a State, raised from taxes on the people or\r\ntheir property, from duties on foreign merchandise imported into the\r\ncountry, and from the sale of public lands and other sources, to meet\r\nthe expenses of the government. A remonstrance, Bryce, is a\r\nsetting-forth in strong terms, either by writing or by word of mouth,\r\nthe facts and reasons against something complained of or opposed, as\r\nunjust, unwise, or unadvisable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine,\" said Daniel, with the air of one who had weighed\r\nwell in his own mind a matter of importance, \"what advantage to\r\nthemselves or to the nation George the Third and his ministers could\r\nhave expected, when they laid those heavy taxes on their American\r\nColonies, then took from them the power to pay them by crippling their\r\ncommerce and putting a stop to their manufactures; and it seems\r\nstrange to me that Englishmen could ever have denied to Englishmen the\r\nrights and liberties of Englishmen, without having something more to\r\ngain.\" Here Daniel broke down, and scratched his head; and Uncle\r\nJuvinell, with an approving, good-humored smile, replied, \"Those very\r\nquestions, Daniel, have puzzled many an older head than yours, and\r\nmany a wiser head than mine; and, indeed, some of the most learned\r\nhistorians, who have written about these matters, have expressed\r\nthemselves perplexed at this strange conduct of the king and his\r\nministers, and have been able to account for it only on the\r\nsupposition, that they were all, for the time being, bereft of their\r\nwits, and therefore rendered incapable of foreseeing the tremendous\r\nconsequences of their unjust and ill-judged measures.\"\r\n\r\nMuch gratified at the interest the little folks had taken in such dry\r\nmatters, and seeing that they had no more questions to put to him, and\r\nthat some of the smaller ones were already nodding in their chairs,\r\nUncle Juvinell, by way of winding up the evening's entertainment,\r\nconcluded thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Some of you, my dear children, have read how good Christian, in his\r\npilgrimage to the Celestial City, went on sometimes sighingly,\r\nsometimes comfortably, until he came to the foot of a hill called\r\nDifficulty, where he found three roads to choose between. The one to\r\nthe right went around the bottom of the hill, and led into a\r\nwilderness of dark woods, out of which no one ever found his way again\r\nafter venturing therein. The one to the left went likewise around the\r\nbottom of the hill, and led into a wilderness of dark mountains, which\r\nwas even more difficult to escape from than the one to the right. But\r\nthe middle road, which was narrow and straight, went right up the\r\nsteep and flinty sides of the hill, and was the route that led direct\r\nto Mount Zion. Not being the man to flinch from any difficulty,\r\nhowever great, good Christian hesitated not a moment to choose the\r\nmiddle road; and accordingly he fell from running to walking, and from\r\nwalking to going, and from going to clambering upon his hands and\r\nknees, till he had made his way to the top. Here, as you must well\r\nremember, there met his view a stately palace called Beautiful, kept\r\nby a company of prim, precise, proper, prudent, and pious maiden\r\nladies, who gave our weary pilgrim a cordial but well-considered\r\nreception, and, besides admitting him to the hospitalities of the\r\nhouse gratis, entertained him with a variety of pleasing and edifying\r\ndiscourse. And you have not forgotten, either, how, when they had a\r\nclear morning, these discreet and well-ordered damsels, to reward him\r\nfor the zeal and diligence with which he had heretofore pursued his\r\njourney, as well as to encourage him to still further effort, led him\r\nup to the top of their house, whence he might have a delightful view\r\nof the Delectable Mountains, far, far away. And you also still hear in\r\nmind, how poor Christian must needs pass through the dismal Vale of\r\nHumiliation, and there meet in deadly fight the terrible monster\r\nApollyon; then through the Valley and Shadow of Death, with all its\r\ndoleful sights and sounds; then through the wicked city of Vanity\r\nFair; then through the gloomy domains of Doubting Castle and Giant\r\nDespair,--all before he could hope to set foot on these Delectable\r\nMountains of Emanuel's land.\r\n\r\n\"Now, do you not see, my dear children, that not altogether unlike\r\ngood Christian's case, at this stage of his journey, is that of our\r\nown at this point of our story? But a little while ago we were\r\ntrudging along, sometimes heavily, sometimes swimmingly, till by and\r\nby we reached the bottom of our Hill Difficulty; by which, of course,\r\nyou understand me to mean the causes that brought about our\r\nRevolutionary War. And here, had we gone to the right or the left, we\r\nshould most assuredly have wandered into a wilderness of romance and\r\nBrobdignagian wonders, among whose mazes we would have become\r\nentangled beyond all reasonable hope of escape. But our eyes were\r\nopened to our danger; and like good Christian, by whose example we\r\nmight profit oftener than we do, we knew in what direction lay our\r\nbest interest, and were not to be enticed astray by the prospect of\r\nease or novelty, nor turned back by flinty facts and rough realities.\r\nSo straightway up the difficult hill we marched, lofty and steep as it\r\nwas; and hardly left a stone unturned till we had scrambled to the\r\ntop. This gained, we have felt it our privilege to halt and rest a\r\nwhile, and refresh ourselves with a little pleasing and edifying\r\ndiscourse, one with another, touching what we have seen or heard in\r\nthe course of our journey.\r\n\r\n\"We have thus surmounted the most tedious and difficult part of our\r\nstory. But still there lies before us many a hard-fought battle, many\r\nan irksome siege, many a forlorn retreat, many a gloomy winter-camp,\r\nand many a season of doubt and discouragement, privation and dire\r\ncalamity, through which we must pass before we can hope to set our\r\nweary feet on the Delectable Mountains of Freemen's Land, smiling\r\ninvitingly beyond. But to reward you for the diligent attention with\r\nwhich you have followed me thus far, as well as to entice you to\r\ntrudge on to the end, I will, from this elevated point, unfold to your\r\nview a glimpse of this glorious region, ere 'the war-clouds rolling\r\ndun' from the plains of Lexington and the heights of Bunker's Hill\r\nhave too much obscured our morning sky.\r\n\r\n    \"See yon land of shining mountains,\r\n      Stately forests, verdant dells,\r\n    Sun-bright rivers, sparkling fountains,\r\n      Healthful breezes, balmy smells,\r\n    Golden grain-fields, pleasant meadows,\r\n      Fruitful orchards, gardens fair,\r\n    Lasting sunshine, fleeting shadows!\r\n      Freedom dwells for ever there!\r\n\r\n    Hark! what song is that high swelling,\r\n      Like an anthem dropped from heaven,\r\n    Of some joyful tidings telling,\r\n      Some rich boon to mankind given?\r\n    'Tis a happy people, singing\r\n      Thanks for Freedom's victory won;\r\n    Valley, forest, mountain, ringing\r\n      With one name,--great Washington.\r\n    Through distress, through tribulation,\r\n      Through the lowering clouds of war,\r\n    They have risen to be a nation:\r\n      Freedom shines, their morning-star.\r\n    Would we reach those realms of glory,\r\n      Would we join that righteous band,\r\n    We must speed us in our story:\r\n      Come, let's on to Freemen's Land!\"\r\n\r\nThe next evening, the little folks, upon repairing to the library,\r\nfound their Uncle Juvinell seated, as was his wont, cross-legged in\r\nhis great arm-chair, looking with a fixed and absent gaze into 'the\r\nglowing embers of the fire,' as if his thoughts were far away.\r\n\r\nIn his hand he held an open letter which he had just brought from the\r\npost-office, in the contents whereof, it was evident, he had found\r\nsomewhat of a painful character; for a slight shadow had dimmed the\r\nbrightness of his otherwise placid countenance. So rare a thing as\r\nthat of a cloud on their good old uncle's sunny face caught their\r\nnotice at once; and instead of gathering round him in their usual\r\ncoaxing, teasing, bantering, frolicsome way, they seated themselves\r\nquietly on either hand, and awaited in respectful silence until he\r\nshould rise to the surface of the deep brown-study into which he\r\nseemed to be plunged. But the longer he sat, the harder he looked at\r\nthe fire, and the deeper he sank into his revery, till the little\r\nfolks began to fear that it would be a full hour before he would reach\r\nthe bottom and come up again.\r\n\r\nDaniel, the young historian, sat watching his uncle's countenance with\r\nhis sharp black eyes, expecting each moment to hear him break the\r\nsilence with, \"After the battle of Bunker's Hill;\" or, \"Washington,\r\nupon his arrival at Boston;\" or something to that effect. But, last in\r\nhis own thoughts, Uncle Juvinell still sat cross-legged in his\r\narm-chair, and spoke not a word. At last, just by way of reminding him\r\nthat a select and highly enlightened audience were in waiting to hear\r\nhim, Willie softly arose from his chair, and, filling the little Dutch\r\nmug to the brim with rich brown cider, offered it to his uncle, with a\r\nforward duck of the head and a backward jerk of the heel, which he, no\r\ndoubt, intended for a genteel bow. Uncle Juvinell took it; but set it\r\nagain, with an absent air, untasted on the table. Then, drawing his\r\nspectacles down from his forehead, he again perused the letter he held\r\nin his hand, with earnest attention, the shadow on his brow deepening\r\nas he read.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he laid it on the table, and finally broke the\r\nlong silence; his first words falling like ice-water on the ears of\r\nthe little folks.\r\n\r\n\"Sad news for you, my dear children; sad news for us all! I have just\r\nreceived a letter from my old friend and kinsman, Peter Parley, of\r\nwhom you have all heard so much, and to whom, for the many delightful\r\nbooks he has written, the younger generations of America are more\r\nindebted than perhaps to any man now living. In his letter he tells\r\nme, that, owing to his declining health, and increasing years, he has\r\nceased his literary labors altogether, and betaken himself to New\r\nOrleans, in whose milder climate he hopes he may, in some measure,\r\nrecruit his failing powers. What he says in addition to this I will\r\ngive you in his own words:--\r\n\r\n     \"The effects of that unlucky fall on the ice, while crossing\r\n     Boston Common, so many years ago, I have felt in my right hip,\r\n     to a greater or less degree, ever since; and within the past\r\n     year my lameness has so much increased as to have become a\r\n     matter of much anxiety to my friends, and some uneasiness to\r\n     myself. Taking this in connection with the growing infirmities\r\n     of age, I sometimes have a foreboding that I shall never return\r\n     to Boston alive.\r\n\r\n     \"Under this impression, I now write you, my Cousin Juvinell,\r\n     entreating you, as my nearest living kinsman and much-beloved\r\n     friend, to come and see me at this place, and sojourn here with\r\n     me, until, in the wisdom of a kind Providence, it be determined\r\n     whether my span of life is to be shortened or lengthened yet a\r\n     little more. It will be a comfort to me to have you by my side\r\n     at the closing scene; and it may be that your cheerful presence\r\n     and sunny humor will do more to revive me than I can hope for\r\n     even from this mild, pleasant Louisiana air.\r\n\r\n     \"I know that your compliance with my request will for a season\r\n     prove a serious interruption to the enjoyment of the little\r\n     folks in your vicinity, whom you have taken under your wing,\r\n     and to whose entertainment and instruction so much of your\r\n     useful life is devoted. But they will, I am sure, without\r\n     hesitation, make this sacrifice in behalf of one who has for\r\n     many long years labored so hard and faithfully for their\r\n     happiness and improvement. Commend me kindly to them. Hoping to\r\n     see you at an early day, I remain, as ever, your affectionate\r\n     friend and kinsman,\r\n\r\n     \"PETER PARLEY.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Juvinell went on: \"I am gratified, my dear children, to see in\r\nyour grateful and sympathetic looks, saddened and disappointed though\r\nI know you really to be, that you are ready and willing to sacrifice\r\nwhat pleasure and entertainment my company and conversation may afford\r\nyou, to the comfort and wishes of this venerated and excellent man. My\r\ngoing-away at this moment will, it is true, cause a sad interruption\r\nto our story of the life of Washington; but next Christmas, if we all\r\nbe spared, and your Uncle Juvinell keep his memory fresh and green, we\r\nwill gather together again in this very room, and take it up where we\r\nnow drop it, and follow it through all its eventful changes to the\r\nglorious and happy end. Meanwhile, ponder well in your minds what I\r\nhave already told you of the childhood, youth, and early prime of this\r\nillustrious man. And after all, now that I give the matter a second\r\nthought, we could not have been interrupted at a more suitable place;\r\nfor the account I have given up to this point needs scarcely a single\r\nimportant particular to make it a complete and separate story. We\r\nhave followed him step by step, and seen how he rose, first from the\r\nboy-farmer to the youthful surveyor, from that to the young colonel,\r\nfrom that to the legislator of more mature years, and lastly from that\r\nto commander-in-chief of the armies of a young and rising nation.\r\n\r\n\"The history of his career after this period is, in fact, so closely\r\nconnected with that of his country, as to be altogether inseparable\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\"And again I repeat, ponder well in your minds what I have already\r\ntold you, as being, after all, the part most necessary for you at\r\npresent to know. Ever strive to keep his example before your eyes,\r\never to cherish his virtues in your hearts. Like him, be industrious\r\nin your habits, diligent in your studies, polite in your manners,\r\norderly in your dress, peaceable in your disposition, upright in your\r\ndealings, faithful in your friendships, patient under trials,\r\npersevering under difficulties, strangers to covetousness, content\r\nwith little, moderate with much, generous, self-denying, courageous in\r\nwell-doing, pure in heart, devout in spirit, modest before men,\r\nreverent to your parents, respectful to your superiors, humble before\r\nGod; and, like him, let the clear light of truth shine forth in all\r\nyour words, in all your actions, in all your looks and gestures, in\r\nall your secret thoughts, and in your very souls. Be all this, that\r\nmen may reverence you, that angels may honor you, that God may bless\r\nand reward you.\"\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Juvinell paused; and, as he looked round on the saddened\r\nfaces of his little auditors, a moisture crept out softly upon his\r\neyelashes, and dimmed the brightness of his spectacles. \"It grieves me\r\nmuch, my dearest children,\" said he, after a moment or two,--and there\r\nwas a tremor of deep fatherly feeling in his voice,--\"it grieves me\r\nmuch, that our happy little circle must be broken up. It will be but\r\nfor a season, however; and, when we meet again, we shall be happier\r\nthan had we not parted at all. On Monday, I take the stage-coach for\r\nLouisville; and there I take the steamer 'Eclipse' for New Orleans. As\r\nit is a long journey I have before me, I must needs write many\r\nletters, and do a deal of packing, before setting out: so we will sing\r\nour evening hymn now, and separate for the night.\"\r\n\r\nThen, joining their voices together, they sang that beautiful hymn,\r\n\"Though far away from friends and home.\" At the second line,\r\nhowever,--\"A lonely wanderer I may roam,\"--the little folks fairly\r\nbroke down; their hearts rising into their throats from very grief,\r\nand choking their voices: but, with all the ease of a professed\r\nsinging-master, Uncle Juvinell, though his heart was full too, glided\r\nat once from the lowest bass to the highest treble, which he carried\r\nalone, until some of the children, getting the better of their\r\nfeelings, chimed in with him, when he softly dropped to the very\r\nbottom of his bass again.\r\n\r\nThe hymn ended, the little folks came one by one, and, without\r\nspeaking a word, embraced and kissed their dear old uncle, this best\r\nof men; he laying his gentle hand upon their bowed heads, and blessing\r\nthem with more than his usual fervor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
