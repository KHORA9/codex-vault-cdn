When, after some years, the story reached\r\nSpain in print, men were still alive who would have known whether any such\r\nvoyage had ever been made. Among them was the able and impartial historian\r\nLas Casas, who considered that the story was false, and disproved it from\r\ninternal evidence. The authority of Las Casas is alone conclusive. Modern\r\ninvestigators, such as Robertson, Munoz, Navarrete, Humboldt, Washington\r\nIrving, and D'Avezac examined the question, and they all came to the same\r\nconclusion as Las Casas.\r\n\r\nThe matter appeared to be finally settled until 1865. In that year M.\r\nF. de Varnhagen, Baron of Porto Seguro in Brazil, published a book at\r\nLima,[1] where he was accredited as Brazilian Minister, with the object of\r\nrehabilitating the Florentine's character for honesty, by arguing that the\r\nstory of the alleged voyage in 1497-98 was worthy of credit. This makes it\r\ndesirable that the whole question should once more be discussed. Varnhagen\r\nat least deserves the thanks of all students of the history of American\r\ndiscovery for having published, in an accessible form, both the Latin\r\nand the Italian texts of the letters of Vespucci.\r\n\r\nIt has been decided by the Council of the Hakluyt Society to supply a\r\nvolume to the members containing translations of the letters of Vespucci,\r\nof the chapters in which they are discussed in the history of Las Casas,\r\nand other original documents relating to the subject. Readers will thus be\r\nenabled to form independent judgments on this vexed question; while the\r\nIntroduction will furnish them with the events of the life of Vespucci,\r\nand with a review of the arguments in support of Varnhagen's theory,\r\nas well as of those which militate against it.\r\n\r\nA Life of Vespucci was published by an enthusiastic fellow-countryman\r\nnamed Bandini, in 1745,[2] who collected all there is to be known\r\nrespecting his family and early life at Florence, and reprinted his\r\nauthentic letters. Canovai was another biographer, and a still warmer\r\npanegyrist.[3]\r\n\r\nThere are three spurious letters attributed to Vespucci, but they are\r\nnow so universally held to be forgeries, that they need not occupy our\r\ntime.[4]\r\n\r\nWe learn from Bandini that Amerigo was the third son of a notary at\r\nFlorence, named Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, by Lisabetta Mini, and\r\nthat he was born on March 9th, 1451.[5] He was thus four years younger\r\nthan Columbus. Amerigo studied under his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio\r\nVespucci, a Dominican monk of St. Marco, at Florence, who taught him\r\nLatin. A letter from Amerigo to his father, in Latin, has been preserved,\r\ndated on October 18th, 1476, at Mugello, near Trebbio, whither he had\r\nbeen sent in consequence of an epidemic then raging at Florence. In the\r\nsame year the elder brother, Antonio, was sent to the University of\r\nPisa. He was a scholar and an author. His eldest son, Bartolomeo, rose\r\nto be Professor of Astrology at Pisa, and left a son. His second son,\r\nGiovanni, eventually joined his uncle Amerigo in Spain, and became a\r\npilot. The other brother, Geronimo, went as a merchant to Syria, where\r\nhe lost all he had made after nine years of labour. This is stated in\r\na letter to Amerigo, dated July 24th, 1489, which was brought to Italy\r\nby a priest named Carnesecchi, who was returning.\r\n\r\nAmerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life at Florence,[6] and was\r\neventually taken into the great commercial house of the Medici, the head\r\nof which was Lorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici, who succeeded his father,\r\nLorenzo the Magnificent, in 1492. The house had transactions in Spain,\r\nand required experienced agents at Cadiz. Amerigo, who was then over\r\nforty years of age, and Donato Niccolini were selected for this duty,\r\nand took up their residence at Cadiz and Seville in 1492. In December\r\n1495, an Italian merchant, named Juanoto Berardi, died at Seville, and\r\nVespucci was employed to wind up his affairs. This Berardi had contracted,\r\non April 9th, 1495, to supply the Government with twelve vessels of 900\r\ntons each for the Indies.[7] He handed over the first four in the same\r\nApril, four more in June, and the rest in September, but unluckily the\r\nfour last were wrecked before delivery.[8] On the 10th of April 1495,\r\nthe Spanish Government broke faith with Columbus, and contrary to the\r\nconcession made to him, free navigation was allowed to the Indies,\r\non condition that the ships sailed from Cadiz, and were registered\r\nas submitting to certain engagements as regards the State. Gomara,\r\nan unreliable authority, alleges that many vessels took advantage of\r\nthis concession. It is likely enough that some were sent on commercial\r\nventures, but it is grossly improbable that any discoveries of importance\r\nwere made and left entirely unrecorded. The Admiral remonstrated against\r\nthe infraction of his rights, and the order of April 10th, 1495, was\r\ncancelled on June 2nd, 1497.\r\n\r\nDuring this period Vespucci was engaged at Cadiz as a provision\r\ncontractor. A record is preserved of his having received 10,000 maravedis\r\nfrom Treasurer Pinelo on January 12th, 1496, for payment of sailors'\r\nwages; and we learn from Munoz that other entries[9] prove that Vespucci\r\ncontinued his business of provision merchant at least until May 1498. He\r\ncontracted for one, if not for two, of the expeditions of Columbus. A\r\nvery civil and plausible man was this beef contractor, and the Admiral\r\nspoke of him, seven years afterwards, as being very respectable (_hombre\r\nmuy de bien_).\r\n\r\nIn 1499, the very respectable contractor, who was approaching the age of\r\nfifty, determined to retire from business and go to sea. His own reasons\r\nfor this complete change in his old age were that he had already seen\r\nand known various changes of fortune in business; that a man might at\r\none time be at the top of the well and at another be fallen and subject\r\nto losses; and that it had become evident to him that a merchant's life\r\nwas one of continual labour, with the chance of failure and ruin. It\r\nwas rather late in life to make these discoveries, and it may fairly\r\nbe suspected that there was some more concrete reason for his change of\r\nlife which he concealed under these generalities.\r\n\r\nThe expedition in which Vespucci sailed was organised and fitted out\r\nby Alonzo de Hojeda in 1499. Columbus, having discovered the island\r\nof Trinidad and the mainland of South America on the 31st of July\r\n1498, arrived at San Domingo in the end of August. In October he sent\r\nfive ships to Spain with the news of the discovery, a chart of the\r\nnew coast-line and islands, and a report containing mention of the\r\nexistence of pearls. These precious documents fell into the hands of\r\nBishop Fonseca, who showed them to Hojeda, a man whom he favoured. The\r\nBishop suggested that his _protege_ should equip an expedition to reap\r\nall the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of the Admiral,\r\nand granted him a licence. Hojeda was nothing loth, but he was in want of\r\nfunds, and only succeeded in fitting out four vessels by promising shares\r\nof the expected profits to persons in Seville and Cadiz who would advance\r\nmoney. Vespucci seems to have been one of these promoters of Hojeda's\r\nvoyage. Las Casas supposes that he was taken on board as a merchant who\r\nhad contributed to the expenses, and also possibly on account of his\r\ntheoretical knowledge of cosmography, of which he doubtless made the most.\r\n\r\nAs there is no doubt that Vespucci wrote the famous letters from Lisbon,\r\nwe may gather some idea of the man from their contents. He was fond\r\nof airing his classical knowledge, though it was a mere smattering;\r\nfor he thought that Pliny was the contemporary of Mecaenas,[10] and\r\nthat the sculptor Policletus was a painter.[11] On the other hand he\r\nquotes Petrarch, and gives a correct reference to a passage in Dante's\r\n_Inferno_.[12] He was inaccurate in his narratives and regardless of the\r\ntruth, as was ably shown by Las Casas,[13] while he habitually assumed the\r\ncredit of work which belonged to his superiors; and pretended to knowledge\r\nand influence which he could never have possessed.[14] Though externally\r\ncivil and obliging, he harboured jealousy and hatred in his heart,[15]\r\nand was disloyal towards the men under whom he served.[16] Of his natural\r\nability there can be no doubt. He wrote well, and some of his stories\r\nare capitally told.[17] He must have been a plausible talker, so that,\r\nby such men as Fonseca and Peter Martyr, the theoretical pretender was\r\ntaken at the value he put upon himself, and was believed to be a great\r\npilot and navigator.[18]\r\n\r\nHe was certainly not a practical navigator, much less a pilot, as the term\r\nwas understood in those days. Hojeda, in his evidence, said that he took\r\nwith him \"Juan de la Cosa, and Morigo Vespuche, and other pilots\". In\r\nthis sentence the \"other pilots\" must be intended to be coupled with\r\nJuan de la Cosa, not with \"Morigo Vespuche\". A man of fifty years of\r\nage could not go to sea for the first time and be a pilot. The thing\r\nwould be absurd now, but it would be much more absurd in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. With the perfectly graduated and adjusted instruments, the\r\nfacilities for calculations, and the appliances of all kinds with which\r\nthe modern navigator is supplied, the business of the sea may be learnt\r\nmore quickly than in former days. Yet no one would now dream of calling\r\na middle-aged man an expert navigator because he had read a book on\r\nastronomy and made one or two voyages. In the fifteenth century the\r\ninstruments were of the roughest kind, and much more depended on the\r\nskill and intuitive instincts of the seaman himself, qualifications\r\nwhich could only be acquired by a long training and many years of\r\nexperience. Vespucci has the assurance to talk of his astrolabe and\r\nquadrant and sea chart, and to write disparagingly of the trained\r\npilots of whom he was jealous.[19] But his own writings make it clear\r\nto any seaman that the Florentine contractor was merely a landlubber\r\nwith a smattering of Sacrobosco or some other work _De Sphaera_, which\r\nenabled him to impose upon his brother landsmen by talking of climates,\r\nof steering by winds, and of measuring diameters of fixed stars. Hojeda\r\ncertainly did not ship a pilot when he took Amerigo Vespucci on board,\r\nbut a very clever and very plausible landsman with a keen eye to his\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\nAlonzo de Hojeda left Cadiz, with four vessels, on May 20th, 1499.\r\nEndeavouring to steer by the chart of Columbus, he made a landfall at\r\nsome distance to the south of Paria, off the mouths of the Orinoco.\r\nCoasting along to the northward, he came to the Gulf of Paria, went out\r\nby the Boca del Drago, and visited the island of Margarita. He then\r\nproceeded along the coast of the continent, visited Curacoa, which he\r\ncalled the \"Isla de los Gigantes\", and came to the Gulf of Maracaibo,\r\nwhere he found a village built on piles, which was named Venezuela, or\r\nLittle Venice. His most western point was the province of Cuquibacoa and\r\nthe Cabo de la Vela. His discovery consisted of 200 leagues of coast to\r\nthe west of Paria. Along this coast Hojeda obtained gold and pearls. He\r\nhad an encounter with the natives, in which one Spaniard was killed\r\nand about twenty wounded, the place being named \"Puerto Flechado\". He\r\nrefitted in a harbour where the people were friendly, and which Amerigo\r\nconsidered to be the best harbour in the world. Las Casas believed this\r\nto have been Cariaco, near Cumana. On leaving the coast Hojeda proceeded\r\nto Espanola, where he behaved in the outrageous manner described by Las\r\nCasas,[20] remaining two months and seventeen days, from September 5th,\r\n1499, to November 22nd, finally visiting some islands, probably the\r\nBahamas,[21] and carrying off 200 natives as slaves. Hojeda returned to\r\nCadiz in February 1500. In the same year Juan de la Cosa, the pilot of the\r\nexpedition, compiled his famous map of the world, on which he delineated\r\nthis new coast-line from Paria to Cabo de la Vela, the extreme point\r\nof continental land that was known up to that time. On this coast-line\r\nhe placed twenty-two names, including the Boca del Drago, Margarita,\r\nthe \"Isla de los Gigantes\", the Lake of Venezuela (or Little Venice),\r\nand the Cabo de la Vela. The map of Juan de la Cosa is important when\r\nwe come to the consideration of the statements in the letters of Vespucci.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine, on his return from this voyage, took up his residence\r\nat Seville. Here, according to his own account, he received a message\r\nfrom the King of Portugal, asking him to come to Lisbon. The bearer of\r\nthe message was a countryman of his own, named Giuliano di Bartolomeo\r\ndi Giocondo, and Vespucci would have us believe that the King attached\r\nimportance to his entering the Portuguese service. The Visconde de\r\nSantarem has searched the archives in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, and\r\nall the Portuguese documents in Paris, without once meeting with the\r\nname of Vespucci. This absence of all official allusion to him points\r\nto the conclusion that he never held any important position as pilot or\r\ncommander. He asserts that he joined a Portuguese expedition of discovery\r\nalong the coast of Brazil, which sailed on March 10th, 1501, and returned\r\non September 7th, 1502.[22] In the following March or April (1503)\r\nhe addressed a letter to the head of the mercantile house to which he\r\nhad belonged, Lorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici, giving his account of\r\nthe voyage. On May 10th, 1503, he sailed from Lisbon on another voyage,\r\nreturning on June 28th, 1504.\r\n\r\nIn the following September he finished writing the famous letter\r\ncontaining an account of his alleged four voyages. The original Italian\r\nversion was sent to a magnificent Lord, who is supposed to have been Piero\r\nSoderini, Gonfaloniere of Florence in 1504; and a French translation\r\nwas sent to Rene, Duke of Lorraine. Soon afterwards Vespucci left the\r\nPortuguese service and returned to Spain.\r\n\r\nIn February 1505, the Admiral, Christopher Columbus, was laid up with\r\nan illness at Seville, while his brother and his son Diego were at\r\ncourt. Vespucci, having returned to Spain from Lisbon, went to pay his\r\nrespects to the great discoverer, and the Admiral entrusted him with a\r\nletter to his son. \"The bearer of this letter\", wrote Columbus, \"is going\r\nto court on matters relating to navigation. He always showed a desire to\r\nplease me, and he is a very respectable man. Fortune has been adverse\r\nto him, as to many others. His labours have not been so profitable to\r\nhim as might have been expected. He leaves me with the desire to do\r\nme service, if it should be in his power.\" Vespucci had evidently been\r\ncomplaining to the Admiral that his Portuguese service had been a failure,\r\nand had brought him no profit. He went on to the court of Ferdinand,\r\nand soon obtained employment; receiving letters of naturalisation on\r\nthe 24th of April 1505[23]; but there is no record of his ever having\r\nbeen of any service to the Admiral. He was very plausible, and knew how\r\nto ingratiate himself with men in power. It was intended to send him on\r\na voyage of discovery with Vicente Yanez Pinzon, and in 1506 and 1507\r\nhe was engaged in purchasing provisions for the voyage; but the idea of\r\ndespatching this expedition was abandoned in 1508.[24]\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, from a sentence in a letter from Hieronimo Vianelo,\r\nthe Venetian Ambassador, dated at Burgos on December 23rd, 1506, that\r\nVespucci accompanied Juan de la Cosa on a voyage of discovery to the\r\nIndies during that year.[25] \"The two ships have arrived from the Indies\r\nwhich went on a voyage of discovery under Juan Biscaino and Almerigo\r\nFiorentino.\" But Vianelo must have been misinformed. There are documentary\r\nproofs that Vespucci was in Spain until August 1506. It is highly\r\nprobable that the voluble Florentine retailed the story of Juan de la\r\nCosa's voyage in such a way as to give Vianelo the impression that the\r\nnarrator took part in it himself. The story of the voyage, as we find it\r\nin the letter of the Venetian Ambassador, is quite in Vespucci's manner.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August 1508, Amerigo Vespucci received the appointment of\r\nChief Pilot (_Piloto Mayor_) of Spain, with a salary of 75,000 maravedis\r\na year.[26] The \"Real Titulo\", or commission, is a curious and very\r\ninteresting document. He is ordered to prepare an authoritative chart,\r\ncalled a \"Padron General\", on which all discoveries are to be shown,\r\nand whence the charts for all ships are to be copied; and he is also\r\nto examine all pilots in the use of the astrolabe and quadrant, and\r\nto give instruction in his house at Seville. Vespucci was able to give\r\ntheoretical instruction in cosmography; although a man who first went\r\nto sea when he was nearly fifty, and who had only made three voyages,\r\ncould not be an experienced pilot. With such experts as Juan de la Cosa,\r\nJuan Diaz de Solis, Vicente Pinzon, and others, available, it was indeed\r\na strange selection. But Ferdinand and Fonseca were notorious for their\r\nbad appointments. Columbus was sent home in chains, Blasco Nunez de Balboa\r\nwas beheaded; while high places, for which they were more or less unfit,\r\nwere entrusted to Ovando, Bobadilla, Pedrarias, and Vespucci.\r\n\r\nVespucci held the appointment of Chief Pilot until the 22nd of February\r\n1512, when he died at Seville, aged 61. He had married a Spaniard\r\nnamed Maria Cerezo, but left no children. His widow received a pension\r\nof 10,000 maravedis,[27] to be paid out of the salary of her husband's\r\nsuccessor,[28] Juan Diaz de Solis. Vespucci left his papers to his nephew\r\nGiovanni, son of his brother Antonio, who received the appointment of a\r\nroyal pilot, with a salary of 20,000 maravedis, on May 22nd, 1512.[29]\r\nHe went as chief pilot in the expedition of Pedrarias Davila in 1514;\r\nand is mentioned as a royal pilot in 1515 and 1516. In 1524 he was a\r\nmember of the Badajoz Commission, but was dismissed in March 1525.\r\n\r\nThis is all that is known of the life of Amerigo Vespucci, beyond what\r\nis contained in his own letters, which we will now proceed to consider\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\nOf the two letters of Vespucci that have been preserved, the earliest\r\nwas written from Lisbon in March or April 1503, and was addressed to\r\nLorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici. The original Italian text is lost, but\r\nit was translated into Latin by \"Jocundus Interpreter\", who is supposed\r\nto have been the same Giuliano di Bartolomeo di Giocondo who brought\r\nthe invitation to Vespucci to come to Portugal in 1501.[30] The letter\r\ndescribes the voyage of discovery sent from Lisbon in May 1501, in which\r\nVespucci alleged that he took part. He alludes to a previous letter\r\nin which he had fully described \"the new countries\", and continues:\r\n\"it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries\r\nwere known to our ancestors, and to all who hear about them they will\r\nbe entirely new.\" He does not mention the name of the commander of the\r\nexpedition, and assumes all the glory of the discovery for himself. \"_I_\r\nhave found a continent in that southern part more populous and more\r\nfull of animals than our Europe or Asia or Africa.\"[31] Moreover, the\r\nsafety of the ships, their navigation across the ocean, their escape\r\nfrom perils, were all due to this wonderful beef contractor, if we are\r\nto believe his own account. \"If my companions had not trusted in me,\r\nto whom cosmography was known, no one, not the leader of our navigation,\r\nwould have known where we were after running five hundred leagues.\" He\r\ngoes on to tell us that his \"knowledge of the marine chart, and the rules\r\ntaught by it, were more worth than all the pilots in the world\".[32]\r\nAfter relating some fictitious stories about the natives and their\r\ncannibalism, and giving a glowing but vague account of the vegetation,\r\nhe concludes with some absurd remarks about the stars of the southern\r\nhemisphere, which he has the assurance to tell us were measured by him\r\nto see which was the largest. The letter concludes with the statement\r\nthat this was his third voyage, as he had made two by order of the King\r\nof Spain. This is the first intimation of a design to make two voyages\r\nout of the Hojeda expedition, one of which was to precede the Admiral's\r\ndiscovery of the mainland. He also announces his intention of collecting\r\nall the wonderful things he had seen into a cosmographical book, that\r\nhis record may live with future generations, intending to complete it,\r\nwith the aid of friends, at home. The letter shows the character of the\r\nman, and how little reliance can be placed on his statements.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Medici was printed very soon after it was written. The\r\nfirst issue, entitled _Mundus Novus_, consisting of four 4to leaves,\r\nand the second, _Epistola Albericij de Novo Mundo_, are without place\r\nor date. A copy of the third, printed at Augsburg in 1504, and entitled\r\n_Mundus Novus_, is in the Grenville Library. Then followed two others,\r\nand the sixth issue was the early Paris edition of Jean Lambert, a copy\r\nof which is in the Bibliotheque Nationale. Another Paris edition, nearly\r\nas old, is in the Grenville Library. In 1505, an issue, entitled _De Ora\r\nAntarctica_, and edited by Ringmann, appeared at Strasbourg. The letter\r\nwas also included in the book of voyages, _Paesi novamente retrovati_,\r\nprinted at Vicenza in 1507, where it was called _Novo Mondo da Alb.\r\nVesputio_. It was thus widely circulated over Europe, and Vespucci\r\nobtained the credit of discoveries made by the unnamed Portuguese\r\ncommander. The title, _Novus Mundus_, is taken from the opening boast\r\nof his letter, that it is lawful to call the discovery _a new world_\r\nbecause no one had ever seen it before. It was thus that Vespucci got\r\nhis name connected, throughout Europe, with the discovery of a New World,\r\nand this prepared the way for the proposal to give it the name of America!\r\n\r\nThe more important letter of Vespucci, containing the account of\r\nhis alleged four voyages, was written in September 1504, a short\r\ntime before he left Portugal. A copy, in French, was sent to Rene\r\nII, Duke of Lorraine, while the Italian original was addressed to a\r\n\"Magnificent Lord\", who is supposed, with much probability, to have\r\nbeen Piero Soderini, the Gonfaloniere of Florence from 1502 to 1512.\r\nVespucci speaks of him as having been his schoolfellow, and as being, at\r\nthe time the letter was written, in a high official position at Florence.\r\n\r\nThe French copy was translated into Latin, and published at St. Die in\r\nApril 1507, in the _Cosmographiae Introductio_, a rare little book by the\r\nProfessor of Cosmography at the University of St. Die in Lorraine, named\r\nMartin Waldzeemueller, who used the _nom de plume_ of Hylacomylus. The\r\nItalian version was also printed at an early date, a little volume in\r\nquarto of thirty-two pages, without place or year. It is excessively rare,\r\nonly four copies being known to exist. One belonged to Baccio Valori,\r\nand from it Bandini published a new edition in 1745. It was afterwards\r\nthe property of the Marchese Gino Capponi. The second belonged to Gaetano\r\nPoggiale of Leghorn, and is now in the Palatine Library at Florence. The\r\nthird is in the Grenville Library. The fourth belonged to the Carthusian\r\nMonastery at Seville, and was bought by Varnhagen in 1863 at Havanna.[33]\r\n\r\nThe Medici letter, and both the Latin and Italian versions of the Soderini\r\nletter, are given by Varnhagen in his work on Vespucci.\r\n\r\nThere are forty-four words or expressions of Spanish or Portuguese origin\r\nin the Italian version,[34] which Vespucci must have got into the habit\r\nof using during his long residence in Spain, even when writing in his\r\nown language. Twelve of these refer to things belonging to the sea or\r\nships,[35] an indication that Vespucci was ignorant of maritime affairs\r\nbefore he went to sea with Hojeda in 1499. But the Hispanicisms also show\r\nthat the letter to Soderini was written by an Italian who had lived for\r\nseveral years among Spaniards. Vespucci answers to this description. He\r\nhad been ten years in Spain or Portugal, or in Spanish or Portuguese\r\nships, when he composed the letter to Soderini.\r\n\r\nThe feature in Vespucci's letters that has struck nearly all the students\r\nwho have examined them, is their extraordinary vagueness. Not a single\r\nname of a commander is mentioned, and in the account of the two Spanish\r\nvoyages there are not half-a-dozen names of places. The admirers of\r\nVespucci explain this away by pointing out that he was corresponding\r\nwith a friend, and only wrote what was likely to amuse him; and that he\r\nrefers to a book he had written for fuller details. This might explain\r\nmany omissions, but it is scarcely sufficient to account for the absolute\r\nsilence respecting commanders and comrades, whom it would be as natural\r\nto mention as dates or the number of ships, and quite as entertaining.\r\nThis extraordinary silence can really be accounted for only by the\r\nassumption that no real names could be made to fit into the facts as he\r\ngave them. This is, no doubt, the true explanation.\r\n\r\nThe \"book\" is referred to in four places in the Soderini letter, and\r\nonce in the Medici letter. In one place Vespucci says: \"In these four\r\nvoyages I have seen so many things different from our customs that I have\r\nwritten a book to be called _The Four Voyages_, in which I have related\r\nthe greater part of the things that I saw, very clearly and to the best\r\nof my ability. I have not yet published it, because my own affairs are in\r\nsuch a bad state that I have no taste for what I have written, yet I am\r\ninclined to publish it. In this work will be seen every event in detail,\r\nso I do not enlarge upon them here.\"[36] A little further on he says:\r\n\"In each of my voyages I have noted down the most remarkable things,\r\nand all is reduced to a volume, in the geographical style, entitled _The\r\nFour Voyages_, in which all things are described in detail; but I have\r\nnot yet sent out a copy, because it is necessary for me to revise it.\"[37]\r\nAccording to these two statements the book had been actually written, but\r\nnot yet revised or shown to anyone. He also speaks of his observations\r\nof fixed stars as being in his _Four Voyages_.[38] But towards the end\r\nof the letter he says that he refrains from recounting certain events,\r\nbecause he reserves them for his _Four Voyages_; and in the Medici\r\nletter he speaks of \"completing his work in consultation with learned\r\npersons and aided by friends, when he should return home.\"[39] From\r\nthese passages the most probable conclusion is, that this book was never\r\nactually written, but that Vespucci intended to write such a work when he\r\nretired to Florence. He, however, never returned home. He went to Spain\r\nand obtained lucrative employment there, and the idea of writing a book\r\nwas abandoned. He would not have dared to publish the story of his first\r\nvoyage in a country where the truth was well known.\r\n\r\nThe statement made by Vespucci respecting his alleged first voyage is as\r\nfollows: He says that an expedition of discovery was sent by the King,\r\nconsisting of four ships, and that the King chose him to go with it. He\r\ndoes not mention the name of the commander of the expedition, nor of\r\nany of the captains or pilots; but he asserts that he was away eighteen\r\nmonths, and that he discovered a great extent of mainland and an infinite\r\nnumber of islands. The ships, he alleges, sailed from Cadiz on the 10th\r\nof May 1497, and proceeded to Grand Canary, which he says is in 37 deg. 30'\r\nN. lat., and 280 leagues from Lisbon. Thence they sailed for thirty-seven\r\ndays on a W.S.W. course, making 1,000 leagues, when they reached the coast\r\nof the mainland in latitude 16 deg. N., and longitude from Canary 70 deg. W.\r\n\r\nHe describes the manners and customs of the people in considerable detail,\r\nand enumerates the animals, giving a particular account of the _iguana_,\r\nbut without giving the animal a name. He also tells us that the native\r\nnames for their different kinds of food are _Yuca_, _Casabi_, and\r\n_Ignami_; and that the word for a man of great wisdom is _Carabi_. He\r\ndescribes a village with forty-four large huts built over the water on\r\npoles, like a little Venice.\r\n\r\nAfter sailing for eighty leagues along the coast he came to another\r\nprovince, of which he gives the name. It is _Parias_ in the Latin version,\r\nbut in the Italian version _L_ has been substituted for _P_, and a _b_\r\nfor _s_, so that the word becomes _Lariab_. Then comes the audacious\r\nassertion to which all this was leading. He says that he sailed along\r\nthe coast, always on a N.W. course, for 870 leagues. At the end of this\r\nmarvellous voyage he came to \"the finest harbour in the world\", where he\r\nfound a friendly people, and remained to refit for thirty-seven days. Here\r\nthe natives complained that they were subject to attacks from savage\r\npeople who came from islands at a distance of about 100 leagues to the\r\neast. The Spaniards agreed to chastise the islanders, and after sailing\r\nN.E. and E. for 100 leagues they came to islands where the natives were\r\n\r\ncalled _Iti_. They had an encounter with them, in which one Spaniard\r\nwas killed and twenty-two were wounded. But they took 222 prisoners,\r\nand sold them as slaves when they returned to Cadiz on October 15th, 1498.\r\n\r\nVespucci's account of the second voyage is that the expedition, consisting\r\nof three ships, sailed from Cadiz on May 16th, 1499, and stopped some\r\ndays at the island of Fuoco. They then crossed the ocean after a voyage\r\nof forty-four days, going over 500 leagues on a S.W. course. The landfall\r\nwas in 5 deg. S., and the country was inundated by the mouths of a great\r\nriver. They then steered north, and came to an excellent port formed by\r\na large island. He describes the chase of a canoe, manned by cannibal\r\npeople called _Cambali_; and the intercourse with inhabitants who told\r\nthem about the pearl fishery.\r\n\r\nThey next landed on an island, fifteen leagues from the land, where the\r\ninhabitants, for want of water, chewed a green herb mixed with white\r\npowder. Leaving this island, they came to another where the people were\r\nso tall that it was named the _Island of the Giants_. They continued\r\nto sail along the coast, having many encounters with the natives. They\r\nfound the latitude to be 15 deg. N., and here they came to a harbour for\r\nrepairing their ships, where the inhabitants were very friendly. They\r\nremained forty-seven days, and collected many pearls. Departing from\r\nthis port, they shaped a course for _Antiglia_ (_Espanola_), where\r\nthey obtained supplies, remaining two months and seventeen days. Here,\r\nhe says, they endured many dangers and troubles from the same Christians\r\nwho were in this island with Columbus, and he believed this was caused\r\nby envy. They left the island on the 22nd of July, and, after a voyage\r\nof a month and a half, they returned to Cadiz on the 8th of September,\r\nthe year not given.\r\n\r\nLas Casas, giving Vespucci credit for two voyages, seems to have thought\r\nthat he might have been with Hojeda again on his second voyage from\r\n1502 to 1504. But Vespucci asserts that he was in Portugal, or serving\r\non board Portuguese ships, during the whole of that period.\r\n\r\nThe first voyage appears, both from internal and external evidence,\r\nto be imaginary. The second voyage is the first of Hojeda inaccurately\r\ntold, while two or three incidents of the Hojeda voyage are transferred\r\nto the imaginary first voyage. The assertion that the King sent an\r\nexpedition of discovery, consisting of four ships, in May 1497, is not\r\ncorroborated. There is no record of any such expedition, and there is\r\nmuch collateral evidence, which will be discussed further on, that no\r\nexpedition was despatched by the King in that year. If such a royal\r\nexpedition had been despatched, with such marvellous results, Las Casas\r\ncould not have been ignorant of the fact. It has been suggested that four\r\nout of twelve ships supplied to the King by Juanato Berardi might have\r\nbeen used for this expedition, and that its despatch is not impossible,\r\nbecause May 10th, 1497, the date of sailing given by Vespucci, is previous\r\nto June 2nd, 1497, the date of the royal order cancelling permission\r\nfor private ships to go to the Indies. But the alleged expedition was\r\nsent by the King, and was not a private one. It is more likely that\r\nVespucci purposely selected a date previous to June 2nd.\r\n\r\nThe voyage across the Atlantic to the mainland, in 16 deg. N., is described\r\nby Vespucci as having been performed in thirty-seven days, with\r\na W.S.W. course, and a distance of 1,000 leagues. Such a course and\r\ndistance would have taken him to the Gulf of Paria, not to a coast in\r\nlatitude 16 deg. N. Even with a course direct to that point, and disregarding\r\nthe intervening land, the distance he gives would leave him 930 miles\r\nshort of the alleged position. No actual navigator would have made such a\r\nblunder. He was quoting the reckoning from Hojeda's voyage, and invented\r\nthe latitude at random. When he came to his second voyage, to make a\r\ndifference, he halved the distance, saying that he was forty-four days\r\ngoing 500 leagues on a S.W. course. He also gives 15 deg. as the latitude\r\nof the coast discovered when he was with Hojeda, though no part of that\r\ncoast is north of 13 deg. His crowning statement that, starting from 23 deg.\r\nN., he went 870 leagues along a coast always on a N.W. course, is still\r\nmore preposterous. Such a course and distance would have taken him right\r\nacross the continent of North America into British Columbia.\r\n\r\nVarnhagen accepts the Florentine's latitudes, and assumes that when in\r\n23 deg. N. he was near Tampico, on the coast of Mexico. But he rejects the\r\nimpossible courses and distances of Vespucci, substituting an imaginary\r\nvoyage of his own, by which he takes our contractor along the coast of\r\nNorth America, round the peninsula of Florida, and up to Cape Hatteras,\r\nwhere, he confesses, \"the finest harbour in the world\" is not to be\r\nfound. But such a voyage is a pure assumption, and as a serious argument\r\nit is quite inadmissible. The evidence is the other way. The latitudes\r\nare wrong, judging from the one latitude given by the Florentine in his\r\nsecond voyage, while the courses and distances might be relied upon as\r\nroughly correct if they were given by an honest man. Their absurdity\r\nproves the imposture.\r\n\r\nFrom \"the best harbour in the world\" Vespucci says that he went eastward\r\nfor 100 leagues to some very populous islands called _Iti_, where the\r\npeople, after severe fighting, were defeated by the Spaniards, 222 being\r\ncarried off as slaves. Having brought his _protege_ to Cape Hatteras,\r\nVarnhagen would identify _Iti_ with Bermuda. But there were no natives\r\non Bermuda when it was discovered, and no indications that it had ever\r\nbeen inhabited. The islands where this wholesale kidnapping took place,\r\nif the story has any foundation in fact, were probably the Windward\r\nIslands or the Bahamas, visited by Hojeda with this object after he\r\nleft St. Domingo. The word _Iti_ appears to have been an invention\r\nof Vespucci: perhaps he was thinking of the old Italian form _Iti_\r\n(\"gone\")--which he uses in its proper sense in his second voyage--or of\r\n_Hayti_, the native name for Espanola.\r\n\r\nThere are two, or perhaps three, incidents in the story of the alleged\r\nfirst voyage which happened in the voyage when Vespucci was with Hojeda.\r\nThe first is the village built on piles over the water. Such a village\r\nwas discovered by Hojeda at the entrance of the Gulf of Maracaibo, and\r\ncalled Little Venice, or Venezuela. Vespucci describes exactly the same\r\nthing in his first voyage, but does not mention it in his second (or\r\nHojeda) voyage. He took it out of the real voyage in order to embellish\r\nthe imaginary one. Varnhagen argues that there might easily have been\r\ntwo villages built on piles. But that is not the point. The point is,\r\nthat there is no mention of the fact in its proper place, while it\r\noccurs in this imaginary voyage in a way that points unmistakably to the\r\nsource whence it came. Then there is \"the best harbour in the world\",\r\nwhere there were friendly natives, and where the ships were refitted,\r\nthe duration of the stay being given as thirty-seven days in the first,\r\nand forty-four days in the second voyage; evidently the same incident,\r\nserving for the imaginary as well as for the real voyage. This \"best\r\nharbour in the world\" was, according to Las Casas, the Gulf of Cariaco,\r\nnear Cumana, where Hojeda refitted. Lastly, there is the encounter with\r\nnatives, when one Spaniard was killed and twenty-two wounded. Vespucci\r\nasserts that an encounter took place during his first voyage with this\r\nnumber of casualties. Las Casas had seen a letter from Roldan, containing\r\ninformation from Hojeda's officers, in which an encounter is mentioned\r\nwith the same casualties, one killed and about twenty wounded. Modern\r\ncritics will agree with Las Casas that this coincidence is alone\r\nsufficient to prove the fictitious character of the first voyage of\r\nVespucci.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Vespucci's narrative of his first voyage is taken\r\nup with accounts of the manners and customs of the natives; touching\r\nwhich Las Casas has made some very pertinent remarks. Many of the things\r\nVespucci states could not have been known to him in the few days that\r\nhe remained on the coast, because he did not know a single word of the\r\nlanguage, as he himself confesses. He can only be believed in those\r\nstatements based on what he actually saw or might have seen, and all\r\nthese are perfectly applicable to the natives of the coast seen during\r\nHojeda's voyage. The rest are pronounced by Las Casas to be all fiction;\r\nas well as his enumeration of the animals he saw. Vespucci gives one word\r\nin the native language--_Carabi_, meaning \"a man of great wisdom\". Upon\r\nthis Las Casas remarks that the Spaniards did not even know the names\r\nfor bread or for water, yet Vespucci wants us to believe that, during\r\nthe few days he remained at that place, he understood that _Carabi_\r\nsignified a man of great wisdom. He got the word, of course, from the\r\nname of the people he heard of during the voyage of Hojeda--the Carribs,\r\nor Canibas--and made it serve his purpose in this passage.[40]\r\n\r\nVespucci does not mention the names of the commanders of the expedition,\r\nnor of any of his Spanish comrades; and he gives only one native word,\r\n_Carabi_; three names of articles of food, _Yuca_, _Casabi_, and _Ignami_;\r\nand two names of places, _Iti_ and _Parias_ (or _Lariab_?).\r\n\r\nTwo of the names for food, _Yuca_ and _Casabi_, belong to the language\r\nof the Antilles, and Vespucci would have heard of them during his voyage\r\nwith Hojeda. _Ignami_ is an African word, which he would have picked up\r\nat Lisbon. The use of the word _Yuca_, as belonging to the language of\r\nthe natives of the Mexican coast near 23 deg. N., is one more proof of the\r\nimposture of his narrative.[41]\r\n\r\nThe name of _Parias_ requires fuller notice. It is alleged to be the\r\nname of a province in 23 deg. N., and is thus spelt in the Latin version.\r\nLas Casas, therefore, naturally used it as one argument against the truth\r\nof Vespucci's narrative, for _Paria_ was well known to be a province of\r\nthe mainland opposite the island of Trinidad, discovered by Columbus. But\r\nin the Italian version the word is _Lariab_, an _L_ being substituted\r\nfor _P_, and _b_ for _s_. Varnhagen endeavours to make a strong point\r\nof this discrepancy. He eagerly adopts _Lariab_ as the correct form,\r\nhaving found (not _Lariab_) but two words ending in _ab_ in a vocabulary\r\nof the Huasteca Indians, whose country is near the northern frontier of\r\nMexico. It is impossible to ascertain, with certainty, whether _Parias_,\r\nor _Lariab_, or either, was the word in the original manuscript of\r\nVespucci, which is lost. It is in favour of _Lariab_ that the Italian\r\nversion was probably printed from the manuscript without previous\r\ntranslation; while the version containing _Parias_ was translated into\r\nFrench, and then into Latin, before it was printed. On the other hand,\r\nthere is strong reason for the belief that the editor of the Latin version\r\nhad not then heard of the particulars of the third voyage of Columbus,\r\nor of the name of Paria.[42] In that case it could not have come into\r\nhis head to print _Parias_ for _Lariab_, and consequently _Parias_ was\r\nthe original form, and _Lariab_ a misprint of the Italian version. On the\r\nwhole, _Parias_ is probably correct; but the question is not important,\r\nbecause the evidence against Vespucci is quite sufficient without the\r\n_Parias_ argument.\r\n\r\nThe internal evidence against the authenticity of the first voyage is\r\nconclusive. It satisfied the impartial and acute historian Las Casas\r\nat the time, and has not been shaken by the arguments of Varnhagen,\r\nwho did not adduce any new facts. But the external evidence is even\r\nstronger. It was evident to Varnhagen that it was a necessity of his\r\nargument that an expedition should be provided, with which Vespucci might\r\nhave sailed. Without vessels and a commander there could have been no\r\nvoyage. These essentials have been furnished by the rehabilitator of\r\nVespucci with some audacity. It was recorded by Las Casas and Herrera\r\nthat, after the return of Columbus from his last voyage in 1505, an\r\nexpedition to follow up his discoveries was fitted out by Vicente Yanez\r\nPinzon, Juan Diaz de Solis, and Pedro de Ledesma, and that they discovered\r\nthe coast of Yucatan. Herrera gives the date 1506; but the real date\r\nwas 1508, as given by Peter Martyr.[43] The authority for the narratives\r\nof Las Casas and Herrera is the evidence given by Pinzon, Ledesma, and\r\nothers, in the Columbus lawsuit. Peter Martyr, however, collected his\r\ninformation on the subject independently. Varnhagen suggests that these\r\nnavigators did not undertake their voyage, in 1508, after the return of\r\nColumbus, but in 1497, and that this was the first voyage of Vespucci.\r\n\r\nThe arguments for this alteration of eleven years in the date of a voyage\r\nof discovery are slight indeed. Oviedo, in his _History of the Indies_,\r\nwrote that the pilots Pinzon, Solis, and Ledesma discovered the Honduras\r\ncoast with three vessels, before Pinzon was off the mouth of the Amazon,\r\nwhich was in 1499; and Gomara has the following passage: \"but some say\r\nthat Pinzon and Solis had been on the Honduras coast three years before\r\nColumbus.\" These writers were unscrupulous, and hostile to Columbus.\r\nIt requires somewhat bold assurance to give the date of 1497 to the\r\nPinzon and Solis voyages on the strength of these passages. Oviedo\r\nindeed puts Vespucci out of court at once, for he says that Pinzon,\r\nSolis, and Ledesma sailed with three vessels; while Vespucci asserts\r\nthat in his first voyage there were four vessels. Moreover, Ledesma,\r\nwho was pilot and captain of one of the vessels, was a lad of 21 in 1497,\r\nand could not have been in such a position; but in 1508, when the Pinzon\r\nand Solis expedition really sailed, he was of a suitable age.[44]\r\n\r\nAlthough the expedition of Pinzon, Solis, and Ledesma certainly did\r\nnot take place in 1497, there has always been some obscurity attending\r\nits history, which has only recently been cleared up through the\r\nable researches of Mr. Harrisse.[45] The confusion has arisen from\r\ndiscrepancies between the evidence given by Pinzon and Ledesma in the\r\nColumbus lawsuit. Pinzon said that he reached the island of Guanaja in the\r\nGulf of Honduras, and then followed the coast east as far as the provinces\r\nof Chabaca and Pintigron, and the mountains of Caria (Paria?). But\r\nLedesma said that they went north from the island of Guanaja, came to\r\nChabaca and Pintigron, and reached a point as far north as 23-1/2 deg.\r\nHere there is clearly a mistake, one going east and the other north,\r\nyet both coming to Chabaca and Pintigron. It can only be decided whether\r\nthe mistake is in the evidence of Pinzon or of Ledesma by ascertaining\r\nthe positions of Chabaca and Pintigron; and the explanation is afforded\r\nby Peter Martyr in his second _Decade_.[46] He there says that Pinzon\r\nturned his course to the east (\"towards the left hand\") towards Paria,\r\nwhere princes came to him named Chiauaccha[47] and Pintiguanus. Ledesma's\r\nnortherly course was either a falsehood, as Mr. Harrisse rather hastily\r\nassumes, or a clerical or printer's error. The only voyage of Pinzon and\r\nSolis took place in 1508,[48] and was from the Gulf of Honduras eastward\r\nto Paria.\r\n\r\nThere was no voyage of discovery sent by the King in 1497. When\r\nDiego Columbus instituted the lawsuit to recover his father's rights,\r\nthe Crown lawyers turned every stone for evidence that others made\r\ndiscoveries besides the Admiral. The lawsuit lasted from 1508 to 1527.\r\nIf an expedition sent by the King in 1497 had discovered 870 leagues of\r\nnew coast-line, it is incredible that the proofs would not then have\r\nbeen forthcoming, when many of those who took part in the expedition\r\nmust have been alive, and there was not only no reason for secrecy,\r\nbut the strongest motive for publicity.\r\n\r\nWhen the evidence respecting Pinzon and Solis was taken in 1516, Vespucci\r\nhad been dead some years. He had never ventured to publish his letter in\r\nSpain; but Fernando Columbus purchased a copy at Rome and added it to his\r\nlibrary at Seville in 1515, three years after Vespucci's death. If the\r\nfirst voyage had not been known to be a fabrication, the letter would\r\nhave been eagerly brought forward as evidence of extensive discoveries\r\nnot made by the Admiral. For by that time other copies, besides the one\r\nin Fernando's library, had probably reached Spain.\r\n\r\nThen there is the negative evidence of maps. Juan de la Cosa drew his\r\nfamous map of the world in 1500, after serving in the voyage of Hojeda,\r\nin company with Vespucci. He placed flags on the discovered parts, and\r\none on each of the farthest known points. There is a Spanish flag at\r\nCabo de la Vela, the extreme point then known in South America, another\r\nat the extreme point reached by Columbus on the north coast of Cuba,\r\nand an English flag at the extreme point reached by Cabot. A conjectural\r\nline runs round from the last English to the first Spanish flag, and\r\nthere is no sign of the alleged Vespucci discoveries. If it is suggested\r\nthat the Florentine himself kept them secret, without any conceivable\r\nobject for doing so, there were all his companions to proclaim them,\r\nand there must have been an official report. If those 870 leagues of\r\ncoast had been discovered, the discovery must have been shown on the\r\nmap of Juan de la Cosa.\r\n\r\nThe Cantino map furnishes additional evidence against Vespucci of\r\nan interesting kind. This map of the world was compiled for the Duke\r\nof Ferrara by order of Alberto Cantino, to illustrate the voyages of\r\nCorte Real. It was drawn by a Portuguese draughtsman at Lisbon, and was\r\nfinished in the autumn of 1502, having been paid for in November of that\r\nyear. On the Cantino map, the coast-line discovered by Hojeda in 1499 is\r\nshown. It is not copied from the map of Juan de la Cosa, for most of the\r\nnames are different[49]; but the information must have been supplied by\r\nsome one who was in Hojeda's expedition. Vespucci was in Lisbon in the\r\nautumn of 1502; it is, therefore, almost certain that this coast-line\r\nwas laid down from information supplied by Vespucci.[50] If Vespucci,\r\nin 1497, had discovered a coast-line between 16 deg. and 23 deg. N., and another\r\ncoast-line extending from 23 deg. N. for 870 leagues N. W., these marvellous\r\ndiscoveries would also appear on the Cantino map. But there is not a sign\r\nof them. We may conclude from this that Vespucci had not yet conceived\r\nthe idea of the fictitious voyage of 1497, when he assisted Cantino's\r\ndraughtsman in the autumn of 1502. The imposture is first hinted at some\r\nsix months afterwards in the Medici letter of March 1503. Peter Martyr\r\ngives corroborative evidence that Vespucci assisted the Portuguese\r\ncartographer. He says that he visited Bishop Fonseca, and was shown\r\n\"many of those mappes which are commonly called the shipman cardes,\r\nor cardes of the sea: of the which, one was drawen by the Portugales,\r\nwherunto Americus Vesputius is said to have put his hande, beinge a man\r\nexperte in this facultie, and a Florentine borne.\"[51]\r\n\r\nFurther evidence against Vespucci is furnished by the map which was\r\nprepared in 1511 to illustrate Peter Martyr's _Decades_. This author was\r\npersonally acquainted with Vespucci, who was then chief pilot of Spain,\r\nand was intimate with his nephew Giovanni. Yet there is not a sign of\r\nVespucci's alleged discoveries in 1497 on the map of 1511. There was no\r\nmotive for secrecy on the part of Vespucci, or on the part of the captains\r\nand pilots of the four ships; on the contrary, their interest was to\r\nmake the discoveries public and get credit for them. Bermuda appears\r\nfor the first time on the map of 1511, having been discovered by Juan\r\nBermudez. But there is no mention of _Iti_. In this same year, Ponce\r\nde Leon obtained a concession for the discovery of that very coast of\r\nFlorida which, according to Varnhagen, had been discovered in its whole\r\nextent by Vespucci fourteen years before. The concession was actually\r\nmade on the condition that the coast had not been discovered before, and\r\nVespucci was then chief pilot. It is incredible that Vespucci and all his\r\ncompanions should have combined to conceal their wonderful discoveries\r\nwithout any conceivable reason, their silence being most injurious to\r\nthemselves. It is still more incredible that the King should have put\r\nsuch a condition into the concession to Ponce de Leon, if it was true\r\nthat the coast in question had been discovered fourteen years before by\r\nan expedition despatched by himself.\r\n\r\nThe evidence against Vespucci is cumulative and quite conclusive. His\r\nfirst voyage is a fabrication. He cannot be acquitted of the intention\r\nof appropriating for himself the glory of having first discovered the\r\nmainland. The impartial and upright Las Casas, after carefully weighing\r\nthe evidence, found him guilty. This verdict has been, and will continue\r\nto be, confirmed by posterity. He wished to glorify himself in his own\r\ncountry, whither he intended to retire, and throughout Europe. But he\r\ndid not dare to publish his fiction in Spain, and, so far as we know,\r\nit did not reach Spain in print until after his death. He wrote well,\r\nand his stories about a new world excited the enthusiasm of those who\r\nread them. His Latin editor suggested that his new world should be called\r\nAmerica, and the name was adopted by map-makers. It was euphonious and\r\nconvenient, and, in spite of the protests of Las Casas and Herrera, it\r\neventually became general, and Vespucci usurped the honours that rightly\r\nbelonged to Columbus. Vespucci may be acquitted of having contemplated\r\nso great an injustice. It is possible that he never intended that his\r\nletters should be published. He may only have desired to increase his\r\nconsequence among his own countrymen. But whatever his intention may\r\nhave been, he committed a fraud with a dishonest purpose, and it is no\r\nextenuation that he did not contemplate the full extent of the injustice\r\nit has caused.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of Vespucci's statements contained in the first and\r\nsecond voyages destroys all confidence in his unsupported word, when we\r\nproceed to examine his account of the voyages alleged to have been made\r\nby him in Portuguese ships.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention either of Vespucci or of Giocondi, who is alleged\r\nto have brought him the invitation from the King to come to Portugal,\r\neither in the voluminous Portuguese archives, or in the contemporary\r\nchronicle of Damian de Goes. This remarkable silence points to the\r\nconclusion that if Vespucci was really in any Portuguese expedition he\r\ncan only have filled some very subordinate post; probably sailing as a\r\nmerchant or a volunteer.[52]\r\n\r\nVespucci has given us two accounts of his alleged first voyage with\r\nthe Portuguese, which he calls his third voyage. The Medici letter\r\nis entirely devoted to it, while it is also included in the Soderini\r\nletter. The dates and figures seldom agree in the two letters, and\r\nthere is evidence throughout them of the random way in which he wrote,\r\nand of his disregard for truth or accuracy. Sailing with three vessels,\r\non the 10th of March 1501 according to one letter, and on the 15th\r\naccording to the other, they came to a place called Bezeguiche, or\r\nBeseghir,[53] on the west coast of Africa, which Vespucci identifies\r\nas Cape Verd, and places in 14 deg. 30' N. in one letter, and in 13 deg.\r\nwithin the Tropic in the other.[54] Thence they sailed across the ocean\r\nfor sixty-seven days, or sixty-three days, on a S.W. 1/4 S. course for\r\n700 leagues, reaching the coast on the 7th or 17th of August, in 5 deg.\r\nS. latitude. In the Soderini letter there is a story of Portuguese being\r\nmurdered and eaten; but in the Medici letter there is nothing but friendly\r\nintercourse with the natives, with a long account of their manners and\r\ncustoms, obviously as fictitious as those in the first voyage which were\r\ncommented upon by Las Casas. Among the plants he saw, Vespucci gives\r\nthe names of four: cannafistula, Brazil wood, cassia, and myrrh.\r\n\r\nFrom the landfall they sailed eastward for (150) 300 leagues, to a point\r\nof land which was named Cape St. Augustine, and then south and west as\r\nfar as 52 deg. S. Vespucci alleges that the command of the fleet was given\r\nto him, and that he continued a southerly course. In the Medici letter\r\nhe says that he went south until he was 17 deg. 30' from the Antarctic\r\nPole, or in 73 deg. 30' S., which is preposterous. In the Soderini letter\r\nhe reached only 52 deg. S., got into a gale of wind, sighted some land with\r\na rocky coast, and ran along it for 20 leagues.[55] Thence the ships\r\nshaped a homeward course, reached Sierra Leone on June 10th--where one\r\nvessel was condemned as unseaworthy, and burnt--the Azores in the end\r\nof July, and Lisbon on September 7th, 1502. Both letters contain some\r\nabsurd remarks about the stars in the southern hemisphere, and one has\r\na long explanation how two men, one in 39 deg. N. and another in 50 deg. S.,\r\nwould be standing at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nThe second voyage of Vespucci from Lisbon; which he calls his fourth\r\nvoyage, was undertaken for the discovery of Malacca, which he believed\r\nto be in 33 deg. S. latitude, instead of 2 deg. 14' N. latitude, its real\r\nposition. This is a pretty considerable error! The narrative is full of\r\nspiteful and vindictive remarks about the commander of the expedition,\r\nwhose name is not given.[56] One vessel was lost off an island which\r\nappears to have been Fernando Noronha, and two others, with Vespucci,\r\nreached the coast of Brazil and entered a harbour, which was named Bahia\r\ndo todos os Santos. They then sailed along the coast for 260 leagues,\r\nwhere they found another harbour in 18 deg. S. Here they built a fort, and,\r\nleaving a garrison, returned to Lisbon on June 18th, 1504.\r\n\r\nThe two Portuguese voyages may be authentic, though the absence of all\r\nnames, and the silence of the Lisbon archives touching Vespucci, make it\r\nimpossible to identify them. The careless and unreliable way in which\r\nVespucci tells his story renders it worse than useless to speculate\r\non any of the details, beyond the fact that the Portuguese commanders\r\nappear to have explored a considerable part of the coast of Brazil. Any\r\ntheory based on the latitudes given by Vespucci would only mislead,\r\nfor, when the places to which they refer can be identified, they are\r\nwrong, and when given in both the letters, they differ. The letter\r\ndescribing the four voyages was not written for readers acquainted with\r\nthe history and progress of discovery, not for Spaniards or Portuguese,\r\nbut for the Medicis and Soderinis, the Waldseemuellers and Ringmanns,\r\nto whom these tales were new, wonderful, and mysterious. Accuracy and\r\ntruth were of no consequence so long as they believed in Amerigo Vespucci\r\nas the discoverer of the New World and its marvels.\r\n\r\nThe tales of Amerigo Vespucci have a place in the history of\r\ngeographical discovery, and require, although they do not deserve,\r\nserious consideration; the more so as they have, in recent years, been\r\ntreated seriously by a learned and accomplished writer such as Varnhagen,\r\nwho has been followed by one or two eminent and well-known men of letters.\r\nIt is, therefore, proper that translations of the letters should be\r\nprinted by the Hakluyt Society, and that their merits should be fully\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two letters of Vespucci, the present volume contains\r\nthe evidence taken in the Columbus lawsuit bearing on the subject, the\r\nchapters in the history of Las Casas in which the veracity of Vespucci is\r\ndiscussed, the narrative of the voyage of Hojeda from Navarrete, and some\r\nother documents throwing light on the career of the Florentine adventurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI\r\n\r\nON THE ISLANDS NEWLY DISCOVERED IN HIS FOUR VOYAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMagnificent Lord.[58] I submit humble reverence to you and offer due\r\nrecommendations. It may be that your Magnificence will be astonished\r\nat my temerity that I should dare so absurdly to write the present\r\nlong letter to your Magnificence, knowing that your Magnificence is\r\nconstantly occupied in the high councils and affairs touching the lofty\r\nRepublic. And I may be considered not only presumptuous but also idle\r\nin writing things not convenient to your condition nor agreeable, and\r\nwritten in a barbarous style. But as I have confidence in your virtues\r\nand in the merit of my writing, which is touching things never before\r\nwritten upon either by ancient or modern writers, as will be seen, I\r\nmay be excused by your Magnificence. The principal thing that moved me\r\nto write to you was the request of the bearer, who is named Benvenuto\r\nBenvenuti, our Florentine, who is very much the servant of your\r\nMagnificence, as he tells me, and a great friend of mine. He, finding\r\nhimself here in this city of Lisbon, requested me to give an account\r\nto your Magnificence of the things by me seen in different parts of the\r\nworld, during the four voyages that I have made to discover new lands; two\r\nby order of the Catholic King Ferdinand, by the Great Gulf of the Ocean\r\nSea towards the west, the other two by order of the powerful King Manoel\r\nof Portugal, towards the south. He assured me that you will be pleased,\r\nand that in this I might hope to serve you. It was this that disposed me\r\nto do it, being assured that your Magnificence would include me in the\r\nnumber of your servants, remembering how, in the time of our youth, I was\r\nyour friend, and now your servant, going together to hear the principles\r\nof grammar under the good life and doctrine of the venerable religious\r\nfriar of St. Mark, Friar Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, whose counsels and\r\ndoctrine, if it had pleased God that I had followed, I should have been\r\nanother man from what I am, as Petrarch says. _Quomodocunque sit_, I am\r\nnot ashamed, because I have always taken delight in virtuous things. Yet\r\nif these my frivolities are not acceptable to your virtue, I will reflect\r\non what Pliny said to Maecenas, \"Formerly my witticisms used to entertain\r\nyou.\" It may be that, though your Magnificence is continually occupied\r\nwith public affairs, you may find an hour of leisure, during which you\r\ncan pass a little time in frivolous or amusing things, and so, as a\r\nchange from so many occupations, you may read this my letter. For you\r\nmay well turn for a brief space from constant care and assiduous thought\r\nconcerning public affairs.\r\n\r\nYour Magnificence must know that the motive of my coming into this\r\nkingdom of Spain was to engage in mercantile pursuits, and that I was\r\noccupied in such business for nearly four years, during which I saw\r\nand knew various changes of fortune. As these affairs of commerce are\r\nuncertain, a man being at one time at the top of the well, and at another\r\nfallen and subject to losses, and as the continual labour that a man is\r\nexposed to who would succeed, became evident to me, as well as exposure\r\nto dangers and failures, I decided upon leaving the mercantile career,\r\nand upon entering on one that would be more stable and praiseworthy. I\r\nwas disposed to see some part of the world and its wonders.\r\n\r\nTime and opportunity offered themselves very conveniently. The King Don\r\nFernando of Castille,[59] having ordered four ships to be dispatched for\r\nthe discovery of new lands towards the west, I was chosen by his Highness\r\nto go in this fleet to help in the discovery. I left the port of Cadiz on\r\nthe 10th of May[60] 1497, and we took our way for the Great Gulf of the\r\nOcean Sea, on which voyage I was engaged for eighteen months, discovering\r\na great extent of mainland, and an infinite number of islands, most of\r\nthem inhabited, of which no mention had been made by ancient writers, I\r\nbelieve because they had not any clear information. If I remember rightly,\r\nI have read somewhere that this Ocean Sea was without inhabitants. Our\r\npoet Dante was of this opinion, in the 26th chapter of the _Inferno_,\r\nwhere he treats of the death of Ulysses.[61] In this voyage I saw many\r\nwonderful things, as your Magnificence will understand. As I said before,\r\nwe left the port of Cadiz in four ships, and began our navigation to the\r\nFortunate Islands, which are now called the Grand Canaria, situated in\r\nthe Ocean Sea, on the confines of the inhabited west, within the third\r\nclimate.[62] Over which place the Pole rises from the north, above the\r\nhorizon 27 deg. and a half, and it is distant from this city of Lisbon 280\r\nleagues,[63] between south and south-west. Here we staid for eight days,\r\nproviding ourselves with wood, water, and other necessaries. From thence,\r\nhaving offered our prayers, we weighed, and spread our sails to the\r\nwind, shaping our course to the west, with a point to south-west.[64]\r\nOur progress was such that at the end of thirty-seven days[65] we reached\r\nland which we judged to be the mainland, being distant from the island of\r\nCanaria, more to the west, nearly 1,000 leagues,[66] outside that which\r\nis inhabited in the Torrid Zone. For we found the North Pole was above\r\nits horizon 16 deg.; and more to the westward than the island of Canaria,\r\naccording to the observations with our instruments 70 deg.[67]\r\n\r\nWe anchored with our ships at a distance of a league and a half from the\r\nshore. We got out the boats, and, filled with armed men, we pulled them\r\nto the shore. Before we arrived we had seen many men walking along the\r\nbeach, at which we were much pleased; and we found that they were naked,\r\nand they showed fear of us, I believe because we were dressed and of\r\na different stature. They all fled to a hill, and, in spite of all the\r\nsigns of peace and friendship that we made, they would not come to have\r\nintercourse with us. As night was coming on, and the ship was anchored\r\nin a dangerous place, off an open unsheltered coast, we arranged to get\r\nunder weigh the next day, and to go in search of some port or bay where\r\nwe could make our ships secure. We sailed along the coast to the north,\r\nalways in sight of land, and the people went along the beach. After\r\ntwo days of navigation we found a very secure place for the ships,\r\nand we anchored at a distance of half a league from the land, where we\r\nsaw very many people. We went on shore in the boats on the same day,\r\nand forty men in good order landed. The natives were still shy of us,\r\nand we could not give them sufficient confidence to induce them to come\r\nand speak with us. That day we worked so hard with this object by giving\r\nthem our things, such as bells, looking-glasses, and other trifles, that\r\nsome of them took courage and came to treat with us. Having established\r\na friendly understanding, as the night was approaching we took leave of\r\nthem, and returned on board. Next day, at dawn, we saw that there were\r\nan immense number of people on the beach, and that they had their women\r\nand children with them. We went on shore, and found that they all came\r\nladen with their food supplies, which are such as will be described in\r\ntheir place. Before we arrived on shore, many of them swam out to receive\r\nus at a cross-bow shot's distance; for they are great swimmers, and they\r\nshowed as much confidence as if we had been having intercourse with them\r\nfor a long time; and we were pleased at seeing their feelings of security.\r\n\r\nWhat we knew of their life and customs was that they all go naked, as well\r\nthe men as the women, without covering anything, no otherwise than as they\r\ncome out of their mothers' wombs. They are of medium stature, and very\r\nwell proportioned. The colour of their skins inclines to red, like the\r\nskin of a lion, and I believe that, if they were properly clothed, they\r\nwould be white like ourselves. They have no hair whatever on their bodies,\r\nbut they have very long black hair, especially the women, which beautifies\r\nthem. They have not very beautiful faces, because they have long eyelids,\r\nwhich make them look like Tartars. They do not allow any hairs to grow on\r\ntheir eyebrows, nor eyelashes, nor in any other part except on the head,\r\nwhere it is rough and dishevelled. They are very agile in their persons,\r\nboth in walking and running, as well the men as the women; and think\r\nnothing of running a league or two, as we often witnessed; and in this\r\nthey have a very great advantage over us Christians. They swim wonderfully\r\nwell, and the women better than the men; for we have found and seen them\r\nmany times two leagues at sea, without any help whatever in swimming.\r\n\r\nTheir arms are bows and arrows, well made, except that they have no iron,\r\nnor any other kind of hard metal. Instead of iron they use teeth of\r\nanimals or of fish, or a bit of wood well burnt at the point. They are\r\nsure shots, and where they aim they hit. In some places the women use\r\nthese bows. They have other weapons like lances, hardened by fire, and\r\nclubs with the knobs very well carved. They wage war among themselves with\r\npeople who do not speak their language, carrying it on with great cruelty,\r\ngiving no quarter, if not inflicting greater punishment. When they go to\r\nwar they take their women with them; not because they fight, but because\r\nthey carry the provisions in rear of the men. A woman carries a burden on\r\nher back, which a man would not carry, for thirty or forty leagues, as we\r\nhave seen many times. They have no leader, nor do they march in any order,\r\nno one being captain. The cause of their wars is not the desire of rule\r\nnor to extend the limits of their dominions, but owing to some ancient\r\nfeud that has arisen among them in former times. When asked why they\r\nmade war, they have no other answer than that it is to avenge the death\r\nof their ancestors and their fathers. They have neither king nor lord,\r\nnor do they obey anyone, but live in freedom. Having moved themselves to\r\nwage war, when the enemy have killed or captured any of them, the oldest\r\nrelation arises and goes preaching through the streets and calling upon\r\nhis countrymen to come with him to avenge the death of his relation,\r\nand thus he moves them by compassion. They do not bring men to justice,\r\nnor punish a criminal. Neither the mother nor the father chastise their\r\nchildren, and it is wonderful that we never saw a quarrel among them. They\r\nshow themselves simple in their talk, and are very sharp and cunning\r\nin securing their ends. They speak little, and in a low voice. They use\r\nthe same accents as ourselves, forming their words either on the palate,\r\nthe teeth, or the lips, only they have other words for things. Great is\r\nthe diversity of languages, for in a hundred leagues we found such change\r\nin the language that the inhabitants could not understand each other.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of life is very barbarous, for they have no regular time for\r\ntheir meals, but they eat at any time that they have the wish, as often\r\nat night as in the day--indeed, they eat at all hours. They take their\r\nfood on the ground, without napkin or any other cloth, eating out of\r\nearthen pots which they make, or out of half calabashes. They sleep in\r\ncertain very large nets made of cotton,[69] and suspended in the air;\r\nand if this should seem a bad way of sleeping, I say that it is pleasant\r\nto sleep in that manner, and that we slept better in that way than\r\nin coverlets.[70] They are a people of cleanly habits as regards their\r\nbodies, and are constantly washing themselves. When they empty the stomach\r\nthey do everything so as not to be seen, and in this they are clean and\r\ndecent; but in making water they are dirty and without shame, for while\r\ntalking with us they do such things without turning round, and without\r\nany shame. They do not practise matrimony among them, each man taking as\r\nmany women as he likes, and when he is tired of a woman he repudiates her\r\nwithout either injury to himself or shame to the woman, for in this matter\r\nthe woman has the same liberty as the man. They are not very jealous,\r\nbut lascivious beyond measure, the women much more so than the men. I do\r\nnot further refer to their contrivances for satisfying their inordinate\r\ndesires, so that I may not offend against modesty. They are very prolific\r\nin bearing children, and in their pregnancy they are not excused any work\r\nwhatever. The parturition is so easy, and accompanied by so little pain,\r\nthat they are up and about the next day. They go to some river to wash,\r\nand presently are quite well, appearing on the water like fish. If they\r\nare angry with their husbands they easily cause abortion with certain\r\npoisonous herbs or roots, and destroy the child. Many infants perish in\r\nthis way. They are gifted with very handsome and well-proportioned bodies,\r\nand no part or member is to be seen that is not well formed. Although\r\nthey go naked, yet that which should be concealed is kept between the\r\nthighs so that it cannot be seen. Yet there no one cares, for the same\r\nimpression is made on them at seeing anything indecent as is made on\r\nus at seeing a nose or mouth. Among them it is considered strange if\r\na woman has wrinkles on the bosom from frequent parturition, or on the\r\nbelly. All parts are invariably preserved after the parturition as they\r\nwere before. They showed an excessive desire for our company.\r\n\r\nWe did not find that these people had any laws; they cannot be called Moors\r\nnor Jews, but worse than Gentiles. For we did not see that they offered any\r\nsacrifices, nor have they any place of worship. I judge their lives to be\r\nEpicurean. Their habitations are in common. Their dwellings, are like huts,\r\nbut strongly built of very large trees, and covered with palm leaves,\r\nsecure from tempests and winds. In some places they are of such length\r\nand width that we found 600 souls in one single house. We found villages\r\nof only thirteen houses where there were 4,000 inhabitants. They build\r\nthe villages every eight or ten years, and when asked why they did this,\r\nthey replied that it was because the soil was corrupted and infected, and\r\ncaused diseases in their bodies, so they chose a new site. Their wealth\r\nconsists of the feathers of birds of many colours, or \"paternosters\" made\r\nof the fins of fishes, or of white or green stones, which they wear on\r\ntheir necks, lips, and ears; and of many other things which have no value\r\nfor us. They have no commerce, and neither buy nor sell. In conclusion,\r\nthey live, and are content with what nature has given them.\r\n\r\nThey have none of the riches which are looked upon as such in our Europe\r\nand in other parts, such as gold, pearls, or precious stones: and even\r\nif they have them in their country, they do not work to get them. They\r\nare liberal in their giving, for it is wonderful if they refuse anything,\r\nand also liberal in asking, as soon as they make friends. Their greatest\r\nsign of friendship is to give their wives or daughters, and a father\r\nand mother considered themselves highly honoured when they brought us a\r\ndaughter, especially if she was a virgin, that we should sleep with her,\r\nand in doing this they use terms of warm friendship.\r\n\r\nWhen they die they use several kinds of burial. Some bury their dead\r\nwith water and food, thinking they will want it. They have no ceremonies\r\nof lights, nor of weeping. In some other places they practise a most\r\nbarbarous and inhuman kind of interment. This is that when a sick or\r\ninfirm person is almost in the throes of death, his relations carry him\r\ninto a great wood, and fasten one of those nets in which they sleep to\r\ntwo trees. They put their dying relation into it, and dance round him\r\nthe whole of one day. When night comes on they put water and food enough\r\nfor four or six days at his head, and then leave him alone, returning\r\nto their village. If the sick man can help himself, and eats and lives\r\nso as to return to the village, they receive him with ceremony, but few\r\nare those who escape. Most of them die, and that is their sepulchre. They\r\nhave many other customs, which are omitted to avoid prolixity. In their\r\nillnesses they use various kinds of medicines, so different from ours\r\nthat we marvelled how anyone escaped. I often saw a patient ill with\r\nfever, when the disease was at its height; bathed with quantities of\r\ncold water from head to foot. Then they made a great fire all round,\r\nmaking him turn backwards and forwards for two hours until he was tired,\r\nand he was then left to sleep. Many were cured. They also attend to the\r\ndiet, keep the patient without food, and draw blood, not from the arm,\r\nbut from the thighs and loins, and from the calves of the legs. They\r\nalso provoke vomiting by putting one of their herbs into the mouth, and\r\nthey use many other remedies which it would take long to recount. They\r\nabound much in phlegm and in blood, on account of their food, which\r\nconsists of roots, fruit, and fish. They have no sowing of grain, nor of\r\nany kind of corn. But for their common use they eat the root of a tree,\r\nfrom which they make very good flour, and they call it _Iuca_.[71]\r\nOthers call it _Cazabi_[72] and _Ignami_.[73] They eat little flesh,\r\nunless it be human flesh, and your Magnificence must know that they\r\nare so inhuman as to transgress regarding this most bestial custom. For\r\nthey eat all their enemies that they kill or take, as well females as\r\nmales, with so much barbarity that it is a brutal thing to mention,\r\nhow much more to see it, as has happened to me an infinite number of\r\ntimes. They were astonished at us when we told them that we did not eat\r\nour enemies. Your Magnificence may believe for certain that they have\r\nmany other barbarous customs, for in these four voyages I have seen so\r\nmany things different from our customs that I have written a book,[74]\r\nto be called THE FOUR VOYAGES, in which I have related the greater part\r\nof the things I saw, very clearly and to the best of my abilities. I have\r\nnot yet published it, because my own affairs are in such a bad state\r\nthat I have no taste for what I have written, yet I am much inclined\r\nto publish it. In this work will be seen all the events in detail, I\r\ntherefore do not enlarge upon them here. For in the course of the said\r\nwork we shall see many other special details; so this will suffice for\r\nwhat is general. In this beginning I did not see anything of much value\r\nin the land except some indications of gold. I believe that this was\r\nbecause we did not know the language, and so we could not benefit by the\r\nresources of the land.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to depart and to proceed onwards, coasting along the land; in\r\nwhich voyage we made many tacks, and had intercourse with many tribes. At\r\nthe end of certain days we came to a port where we were in the greatest\r\ndanger, and it pleased the Lord to save us. It was in this way. We went\r\non shore in a port where we found a village built over a lake, like\r\nVenice. There were about forty-four large houses founded on very thick\r\npiles, and each had a drawbridge leading to the door. From one house\r\nthere was a way to all the rest by drawbridges which led from house to\r\nhouse. The people of this little city showed signs that they were afraid\r\nof us, and suddenly they rose all at once. While looking at this wonder,\r\nwe saw about twenty-two canoes coming over the sea, which are the sort of\r\nboats they use, hollowed out of a single tree. They came to our ships,\r\nas if to gaze with wonder at us and our clothes, but they kept at a\r\ndistance. Things being so, we made signs to them to come to us, giving\r\nthem assurances of friendship. Seeing that they did not come we went to\r\nthem, but they did not wait for us. They went on shore, and made signs\r\nto us that we should wait, and that they would soon return. They went\r\nstraight to a hill, and were not long before they came back, leading with\r\nthem sixteen of their young girls. They got into the canoes and came to\r\nthe ships, and in each ship they put four, and we were as much surprised\r\nat such a proceeding as your Magnificence will be. They were amongst our\r\nships with the canoes, speaking with us. We looked upon this as a sign\r\nof friendship. Presently a number of people came swimming over the sea,\r\nand approached us without our feeling any suspicion whatever, having\r\ncome from the houses. Then certain old women appeared at the doors\r\nof the houses, uttering great cries and tearing their hair in sign\r\nof grief. This made us suspect something, and each man seized his\r\narms. Suddenly the young girls who were on board jumped into the sea,\r\nand those in the canoes came nearer, and began to shoot with their bows\r\nand arrows. Those who were swimming had each brought a lance, concealed\r\nunder the water as much as possible. As soon as we understood the\r\ntreachery we not only defended ourselves from them, but also attacked\r\nthem vigorously and sank many of their canoes with our ships. Thus we\r\nrouted and slaughtered them, and all took to swimming, abandoning their\r\ncanoes. Having thus suffered enough damage, they swam to the land. Nearly\r\nfifteen or twenty of them were killed, and many were wounded. Of our\r\nmen five were wounded, and all escaped, thanks to God. We captured two\r\ngirls and two men. We went to their houses and entered them, but only\r\nfound two old women and one sick man. We took many of their things,\r\nbut they were of little value. We would not burn their houses, because\r\nwe felt compunctions of conscience. We returned to our ships with five\r\nprisoners, and put irons on the feet of each, except the girls. On the\r\nfollowing night the two girls and one of the men escaped with great\r\ncunning. Next day we decided upon continuing our course onwards.\r\n\r\nWe sailed constantly along the coast, and came to another tribe, distant\r\nabout 80 leagues from the one we had left, and very different both as\r\nregards language and customs. We came to an anchor, and went on shore in\r\nthe boats, when we saw that a great number of people were on the beach,\r\nupwards of 4,000 souls. They did not wait for our landing, but took\r\nto flight, abandoning their things. We jumped on shore, and went along\r\na road which led to the woods. At the distance of a cross-bow shot we\r\nfound their huts, where they had made very large fires, and two were\r\nthere cooking their food, and roasting animals and fish of many sorts.\r\nHere we saw that they were roasting a certain animal like a serpent,\r\nexcept that it had no wings, and its appearance was so horrid that many\r\nof us wondered at its fierceness. We walked to their houses or sheds,\r\nand they had many of these serpents alive, fastened by their feet and\r\nwith a cord round the snout, so that they could not open their mouths, as\r\nis done to pointers,[75] to prevent them from biting. Their aspect was so\r\nfierce that none of us dared to go near one, thinking they were poisonous.\r\nThey are the size of a young goat, and a fathom and a half long. They\r\nhave long and thick feet, armed with large claws, the skin hard and of\r\nvarious colours. The mouth and face are like those of a serpent. They\r\nhave a crest like a saw, which extends from the nose to the end of the\r\ntail. We concluded that they were serpents and poisonous, yet they eat\r\nthem.[76] We found that the natives made bread of small fishes, which\r\nthey take from the sea, first boiling them, then pounding them into a\r\npaste, and roasting them in the cinders, and so they are eaten. We tried\r\nthem, and found them good. They have so many other kinds of food, and a\r\ngreater number of fruits and roots, that it would take long to describe\r\nthem in detail. Seeing that the people did not come back, we determined\r\nnot to touch any of their things, to give them more confidence. We also\r\nleft many of our own things in their huts, that they might see them,\r\nand at night we returned to the ships. Next day, at dawn, we saw an\r\nimmense crowd of people on the beach, so we went on shore. When they\r\nagain showed fear we reassured them, and induced them to treat with us,\r\ngiving them everything they asked for. When they became friendly they\r\ntold us that those were their habitations, and that they were come to\r\nfish. They asked us to come to their villages that they might receive\r\nus as friends. They showed such friendship because of the two men we\r\nhad prisoners, who were their enemies. Seeing their importunity, and\r\nafter a consultation, we decided that twenty-eight of our Christians,\r\nin good order, should go with them, with the firm intention to die if\r\nit should be necessary. When we had been there nearly three days we\r\nwent with them into the interior. At a distance of three leagues from\r\nthe beach we came to a village of few houses and many inhabitants,\r\nthere not being more than nine habitations. Here we were received with\r\nso many barbarous ceremonies that the pen will not suffice to write\r\nthem down. There were songs, dances, tears mingled with rejoicings,\r\nand plenty of food. We remained here for the night. Here they offered\r\ntheir wives to us, and we were unable to defend ourselves from them. We\r\nremained all night and half the next day. The multitude of people who came\r\nto see us was such that they could not be counted. The older men prayed\r\nthat we would come with them to another village further in the interior,\r\nmaking signs that they would show us the greatest honour. So we agreed\r\nto go, and it cannot be expressed what great honour they showed us. We\r\ncame to many villages, and were nine days on the journey, so that our\r\nChristians who remained on board became anxious about us. Being nearly\r\neighteen leagues inland in a direct line, we determined to return to the\r\nships. On the return journey the crowd was so great that came with us\r\nto the beach, both of women and men, that it was wonderful. If any of\r\nour people got tired on the way, they carried them in their nets very\r\ncomfortably. In crossing the rivers, which are numerous and very large,\r\nthey took us across by their contrivances so safely that there was no\r\ndanger whatever. Many of them came laden with the things they had given\r\nto us, which were their sleeping-nets, most of them richly worked,\r\nnumerous parrots of various colours, many bows and arrows; while others\r\ncarried burdens consisting of their provisions and animals. What greater\r\nwonder can I tell you than that they thought themselves fortunate when,\r\nin passing a river, they could carry us on their backs?\r\n\r\nHaving reached the shore, we went on board the ships. They made such a\r\ncrowd to enter our ships in order to see them, that we were astonished.\r\nWe took as many as we could in the boats, and took them to the ships,\r\nand so many came swimming that we were inclined to stop such a crowd\r\nfrom being on board, more than a thousand souls, all naked and without\r\narms. They wondered at our arrangements and contrivances, and at the\r\nsize of the ships. There happened a laughable thing, which was that we\r\nhad occasion to fire off some of our artillery, and when the report\r\nwas heard, the greater part of the natives on board jumped overboard\r\nfrom fear, and began to swim, like the frogs on the banks, which, when\r\nthey are frightened, jump into the swamp. Such was the conduct of these\r\npeople. Those who remained on board were so frightened that we were\r\nsorry we had done it, but we reassured them by saying that we frightened\r\nour enemies with those arms. Having amused themselves all day on board,\r\nwe told them that they must go, because we wished to depart that night;\r\nand so they went away with much show of love and friendship, returning to\r\nthe shore. Among this tribe, and in their land, I knew and saw so much\r\nof their customs and mode of life that I do not care to enlarge upon\r\nthem here; for your Magnificence must know that in each of my voyages\r\nI have noted down the most remarkable things, and all is reduced into\r\na volume in the geographical style, entitled the FOUR VOYAGES, in which\r\nwork all things are described in detail, but I have not yet sent out a\r\ncopy, because it is necessary for me to revise it.\r\n\r\nThis land is very populous and full of people, with numerous rivers,\r\nbut few animals. They are similar to ours, except the lions, ounces,\r\nstags, pigs, goats, and deer; and these still have some differences of\r\nform. They have neither horses nor mules, asses nor dogs, nor any kind of\r\nsheep, nor cattle. But they have many other animals all wild, and none\r\nof them serve for any domestic use, so that they cannot be counted.\r\nWhat shall we say of the birds, which are so many, and of so many kinds\r\nand colours of plumage that it is wonderful to see them? The land is\r\nvery pleasant and fruitful, full of very large woods and forests, and\r\nit is always green, for the trees never shed their leaves. The fruits\r\nare so numerous that they cannot be enumerated, and all different from\r\nours. This land is within the Torrid Zone, _under the parallel which the\r\nTropic of Cancer describes_, where _the Pole is 23 deg. above the horizon_,\r\non the verge of the second climate. Many people came to see us, and were\r\nastonished at our appearance and the whiteness of our skins. They asked\r\nwhence we came, and we gave them to understand that we came from heaven,\r\nand that we were travelling to see the world, and they believed it. In\r\nthis land we put up a font of baptism, and an infinite number of people\r\nwere baptised, and they called us, in their language, CARABI, which is\r\nas much as to say, \"men of great wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nWe departed from this port. The province is called PARIAS,[77] and we\r\nnavigated along the coast, _always in sight of land, until we had run\r\nalong it a distance of 870 leagues, always towards the_ NORTH-WEST,[78]\r\nmaking many tacks and treating with many tribes. In many places we\r\ndiscovered gold, though not in any great quantity, but we did much in\r\ndiscovering the land, and in ascertaining that there was gold. We had\r\nnow been thirteen months on the voyage,[79] and the ships and gear were\r\nmuch worn, and the men tired. We resolved, after consultation, to beach\r\nthe ships and heave them down, as they were making much water, and to\r\ncaulk them afresh, before shaping a course for Spain. When we made this\r\ndecision we were near _the finest harbour in the world_, which we entered\r\nwith our ships. Here we found a great many people, who received us in\r\na very friendly manner. On shore we made a bastion with our boats, and\r\nwith casks and our guns, at which we all rejoiced. Here we lightened[80]\r\nand cleared our ships, and hauled them up, making all the repairs that\r\nwere necessary, the people of the country giving us all manner of help,\r\nand regularly supplying us with provisions. For in that port we had\r\nlittle relish for our own, which we made fun of, for our provisions for\r\nthe voyage were running short, and were bad.\r\n\r\nWe remained here thirty-seven days, and often went to their village,\r\nwhere they received us with great honour. When we wanted to resume our\r\nvoyage, they made a complaint how, at certain times, a very cruel and\r\nhostile tribe came by way of the sea to their land, murdered many of\r\nthem, subdued them, and took some prisoners, carrying them off to their\r\nown houses and land. They added that they were scarcely able to defend\r\nthemselves, making signs that their enemies were people of an island at\r\na distance of about 100 leagues out at sea. They said this so earnestly\r\nthat we believed them; and we promised to avenge their injuries, which\r\ngave them much pleasure. Many of them offered to go with us, but we\r\ndid not wish to take them. We agreed that seven should accompany us,\r\non condition that they went in their own canoe. For we did not want to\r\nbe obliged to take them back to their land; and they were content. So\r\nwe took leave of those people, leaving many friends among them.\r\n\r\nOur ships having been repaired, we navigated for seven days across the\r\nsea, with the _wind_[81] between north-east and east, and at the end\r\nof the seven days we came upon the islands, which were numerous, some\r\ninhabited and others deserted. We anchored off one of them, where we saw\r\nmany people, who called it _Iti_.[82] Having manned our boats with good\r\nmen, and placed three rounds of the bombard in each, we pulled to the\r\nshore, where we found 400 men and many women, all naked. They were well\r\nmade, and seemed good fighting men, for they were armed with bows and\r\narrows, and lances. The greater part of them also had square shields,\r\nand they carried them so that they should not impede their using the\r\nbow. As we approached the shore in the boats, at the distance of a\r\nbowshot, they all rushed into the water to shoot their arrows, and to\r\ndefend themselves from us they returned to the land. They all had their\r\nbodies painted with different colours, and were adorned with feathers. The\r\ninterpreters told us that when they showed themselves plumed and painted,\r\nit is a sign that they intend to fight. They so persevered in defending\r\nthe landing that we were obliged to use our artillery. When they heard\r\nthe report, and saw some of their own people fall dead, they all retreated\r\ninland. After holding a consultation, we resolved to land forty of our\r\nmen, and await their attack. The men landed with their arms, and the\r\nnatives came against us, and fought us for nearly an hour,[83] gaining\r\nlittle advantage, except that our cross-bow men and gunners killed\r\nsome of the natives, while they wounded some of our people. They would\r\nnot wait for the thrust of our spears or swords, but we pushed on with\r\nsuch vigour at last that we came within sword-thrust, and as they could\r\nnot withstand our arms, they fled to the hills and woods, leaving us\r\nvictorious on the field, with many of their dead and wounded. We did not\r\ncontinue the pursuit that day, because we were very tired. In returning\r\nto the ships, the seven men who came with us showed such delight that\r\nthey could not contain themselves.\r\n\r\nNext day we saw a great number of the people on shore, still with signs\r\nof war, sounding horns and various other instruments used by them for\r\ndefiance, and all plumed and painted, so that it was a very strange thing\r\nto behold them. All the ships, therefore, consulted together, and it\r\nwas concluded that these people desired hostility with us. It was then\r\ndecided that we should do all in our power to make friends with them,\r\nand if they rejected our friendship we should treat them as enemies,\r\nand that we should make slaves of as many as we could take. Being armed\r\nas well as our means admitted, we returned to the shore. They did not\r\noppose our landing, I believe from fear of the guns. Forty of our men\r\nlanded in four detachments, each with a captain, and attacked them. After\r\na long battle, many of them being killed, the rest were put to flight.\r\nWe followed in pursuit until we came to a village, having taken nearly\r\n250 prisoners.[84] We burnt the village and returned to the ships with\r\nthese 250 prisoners, leaving many killed and wounded. On our side\r\nno more than _one was killed, and twenty-two were wounded_, who all\r\nrecovered. God be thanked! We prepared to depart, and the seven men,\r\nfive of whom were wounded, took a canoe belonging to the island, and\r\nwith seven prisoners that we gave them, four women and three men, they\r\nreturned to their land with much joy, astonished at our power. We made\r\nsail for Spain with 222 prisoners,[85] our slaves, and arrived in the\r\nport of Cadiz on the 15th of October 1498, where we were well received,\r\nand where we sold our slaves. This is what befell me in this my first\r\nvoyage, that was most worthy of note.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VOYAGE ENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the second voyage, what I saw in it most worthy of mention is\r\nas follows: We left the port of Cadiz, with three ships,[86] on the 16th\r\nof May 1499, and shaped our course direct for the Cape Verde islands,\r\npassing in sight of the island of Grand Canary; and we navigated until\r\nwe reached an island which is called the island of FUOCO. Here we got\r\nin our supplies of wood and water, and thence shaped our course to the\r\nsouth-west. In forty-four days we came in sight of a new land, and we\r\njudged it to be the mainland, continuous with that of which mention has\r\nalready been made. This land is within the Torrid Zone, and beyond the\r\nequinoctial line on the south side, over which the Pole rises from the\r\nmeridian 5 deg., beyond every climate. It is distant from the said islands\r\nby the S.W. wind[87] 500 leagues. We found the day and night to be equal,\r\nbecause we arrived on the 27th of June, when the sun is near the tropic\r\nof Cancer. We found this land to be all drowned, and full of very great\r\nrivers. At first we did not see any people. We anchored our ships and\r\ngot our boats out, going with them to the land, which, as I have said,\r\nwe found to be full of very large rivers, and drowned by these great\r\nrivers. There we tried in many directions to see if we could enter;\r\nand owing to the great waters and rivers, in spite of so much labour,\r\nwe could not find a place that was not inundated.\r\n\r\nWe saw, along the rivers, many signs of the country being inhabited; but\r\nhaving ascertained that we could not enter from this part, we determined\r\nto return to the ships, and to try another part. We weighed our anchors,\r\nand navigated between the east south-east, coasting along the land,\r\nwhich trended southwards, and many times we made forty leagues, but\r\nall was time lost. We found on this coast that the current of the sea\r\nhad such force that it prevented us from navigating, for it ran from\r\nsouth to north. The inconvenience was so great for our navigation that,\r\nafter a consultation, we decided upon altering the course to north,\r\nand we made good such a distance along the land, that we reached a most\r\nexcellent port, formed by a large island, which was at the entrance.[88]\r\nWithin, a very large haven was formed.\r\n\r\nIn sailing along the island to enter it we saw many people, and we steered\r\nour ships so as to bring them up where the people were seen, which\r\nwas nearly four leagues more towards the sea. Sailing in this way we\r\nhad seen a canoe, which was coming from seaward, with many people on\r\nboard. We determined to overhaul her, and we went round with our ships\r\nin her direction, so that we might not lose her. Sailing towards the\r\ncanoe with a fresh breeze, we saw that they had stopped with their oars\r\ntossed--I believe, with wonder at the sight of our ships. But when they\r\nsaw that we were gaining upon them, they put down their oars, and began\r\nto row towards the land. As our company came in a fast-sailing caravel\r\nof forty-five tons, we got to windward of the canoe, and when it seemed\r\ntime to bear down upon her, the sheets were eased off so as to come near\r\nher; and as the caravel seemed to be coming down upon her, and those\r\non board did not wish to be caught, they pulled away to leeward, and,\r\nseeing their advantage, they gave way with their oars to escape. As\r\nwe had our boats at the stern well manned, we thought we should catch\r\nthe canoe. The boats chased for more than two hours, and at last the\r\ncaravel made another tack, but could not fetch the canoe. As the people\r\nin the canoe saw they were closely pressed by the caravel and the boats,\r\nthey all jumped into the sea, their number being about seventy men; the\r\ndistance from the shore being nearly two leagues. Following them in the\r\nboats, during the whole day, we were unable to capture more than two,\r\nall the rest escaping on shore. Only four boys remained in the canoe,\r\nwho were not of their tribe, but prisoners from some other land. They\r\nhad been castrated, and were all without the virile member, and with\r\nthe scars fresh, at which we wondered much. Having taken them on board,\r\nthey told us by signs that they had been castrated to be eaten. We then\r\nknew that the people in the canoe belonged to a tribe called _Cambali_,\r\nvery fierce men who eat human flesh. We came with the ship, towing the\r\ncanoe astern, approaching the land, and anchored at a distance of half\r\na league. We saw a great number of people on the beach, so we went on\r\nshore with the boats, taking with us the two men we had captured. When we\r\ncame near all the people fled into the wood. So we released one of our\r\nprisoners, giving him many signs that we wanted to be their friends. He\r\ndid what we wanted very well, and brought back all the people with him,\r\nnumbering about 400 men and many women, and they came unarmed to the\r\nboats. A good understanding was established with them; we released the\r\nother prisoner, sent to the ships for their canoe, and restored it to\r\nthem. This canoe was twenty-six _paces_ long, and two _braccia_[89]\r\nin width, all dug out of a single tree, and very well worked. When they\r\nhad hauled it up and put it in a secure place, they all fled, and would\r\nnot have anything more to do with us; which seemed a barbarous act,\r\nand we judged them to be a faithless and ill-conditioned people. We saw\r\na little gold, which they wear in their ears.\r\n\r\nWe departed and entered the bay, where we found so many people that\r\nit was wonderful. We made friends with them, and many of us went with\r\nthem to their villages in great security. In this place we collected\r\n150 pearls, which they gave us for a small bell, and a little gold was\r\ngiven to us for nothing. In this land we found that they drank wine made\r\nfrom their fruits and seeds, like beer, both white and red. The best was\r\nmade from plums,[90] and it was very good. We ate a great many of them,\r\nas they were in season. It is a very good fruit, pleasant to the taste,\r\nand wholesome for the body. The land abounds in their articles of food,\r\nand the people are of good manners, and the most peaceful we have yet met\r\nwith. We were seventeen days in this port, enjoying it very much, and\r\nevery day new people from the interior came to see us, wondering at our\r\nfaces and the whiteness of our skins, at our clothes and arms, and at the\r\nshape and size of our ships. From these people we had tidings that there\r\nwas another tribe to the westward who were their enemies, and who had\r\nan immense quantity of pearls. Those which they possessed had been taken\r\nin their wars. They told us how they were fished, and in what manner the\r\npearls were born, and we found their information to be correct, as your\r\nMagnificence will hear.\r\n\r\nWe left this port and sailed along the coast, always seeing people on\r\nthe beach, and at the end of many days we came to in a port, by reason of\r\nthe necessity for repairing one of our ships, which made much water. Here\r\nwe found many people, but were unable, either by force or persuasion, to\r\nestablish any intercourse with them. When we went on shore they opposed\r\nthe landing fiercely, and when they could do no more they fled into the\r\nwoods and did not wait for us. Seeing that they were such barbarians we\r\ndeparted thence, and, sailing onwards, we came in sight of an island\r\nwhich was fifteen leagues from the land. We decided upon going to see\r\nwhether it was inhabited. We found on it the most bestial and the most\r\nbrutal race that has ever been seen, and they were of this kind. They\r\nwere very brutish in appearance and gesture, and they had their mouths\r\nfull of the leaves of a green herb, which they continually chewed like\r\nbeasts, so that they could hardly speak; and each had round his neck\r\ntwo dry gourds, one full of that herb which they had in their mouths,\r\nand the other of white flour that appeared to be powdered lime. From\r\ntime to time they put in the powder with a spindle which they kept wet\r\nin the mouth. Then they put stuff into their mouths from both, powdering\r\nthe herb already in use. They did this with much elaboration; and the\r\nthing seemed wonderful, for we could not understand the secret, or with\r\nwhat object they did it.[91]\r\n\r\nThese people, when they saw us, came to us with much familiarity, as\r\nif we had formed friendship with them. Walking with them on the beach\r\nand talking, being desirous of drinking fresh water, they made signs\r\nthat they had none, and offered their herb and powder; from which we\r\nconcluded that the island was ill-provided with water, and that they\r\nkept this herb in their mouths to keep off thirst. We walked over the\r\nisland for a day and a half, without finding a spring of water, and\r\nwe saw that the water they drank was what had fallen during the night\r\non certain leaves which looked like ass's ears, and held the water,\r\nand of this they drank. It was excellent water; and these leaves are\r\nnot found in many places. They had no kind of meat,[92] and no roots,\r\nas on the mainland. They were sustained by fish caught in the sea,\r\nof which they had great abundance, and they were very good fishermen.\r\nThey gave us many turtles, and many large and excellent fish. Their women\r\ndid not have the herb in their mouths like the men, but they all carried\r\na gourd with water, from which they drank. They have no villages nor\r\nhouses, but merely live under bowers of leaves, which shade them from\r\nthe sun, though not from the rain. But I believe that it seldom rains\r\non that island. When they are fishing out at sea they all have a very\r\nlarge leaf, and of such width that it forms a shade. As the sun rises,\r\nso they raise the leaf, and thus they protect themselves from the sun.\r\n\r\nThe island contains many animals of various sorts, and much water in\r\nswamps, and seeing that it offered no profit whatever, we departed and\r\nwent to another island. We found that this other island was inhabited by\r\nvery tall people. We landed to see whether there was any fresh water,\r\nand not thinking it was inhabited, as we had not seen anyone, we came\r\nupon very large foot-marks in the sand, as we were walking along the\r\nbeach. We judged that if the other measurements were in proportion to\r\nthose of their feet, they must be very tall. Going in search, we came\r\ninto a road which led inland. There were nine of us. Judging that there\r\ncould not be many inhabitants, as the island was small, we walked over\r\nit to see what sort of people they were. When we had gone[93] about a\r\nleague we saw five huts, which appeared to be uninhabited, in a valley,\r\nand we went to them. But we only found five women, two old, and three\r\nchildren of such lofty stature that, for the wonder of the thing, we\r\nwanted to keep them. When they saw us they were so frightened that they\r\nhad not the power to run away. The two old women began to invite us with\r\nwords, and to set before us many things, and took us into a hut. They\r\nwere taller than a large man who may well be tall, such as was Francesco\r\ndegli Albizi, but better proportioned. Our intention was to take the young\r\ngirls by force, and to bring them to Castille as a wonderful thing. While\r\nwe were forming this design there entered by the door of the hut as many\r\nas thirty-six men, much bigger than the women, and so well made that\r\nit was a rare thing to behold them. They, in like manner, put us into\r\nsuch a state of perturbation that we rather wished we were on board,\r\nthan having dealings with such people. They carried very large bows and\r\narrows, and great clubs with knobs. They talked among themselves in a\r\ntone as if they wished to destroy us. Seeing ourselves in such danger,\r\nwe made various suggestions one to another. Some proposed that we should\r\nattack them in the hut, and others said that it would be better to do so\r\noutside, while others advised that we should not take any action until\r\nwe saw what the natives were going to do. We at last agreed to go out of\r\nthe hut, and walk away in the direction of the ships as if nothing had\r\nhappened, and this we did. Having taken our route to return to the ships,\r\nthey also came along behind us at a distance of about a stone's-throw,\r\ntalking among themselves. I believe they had not less fear of us than we\r\nof them; for sometimes we stopped to rest, and they did so also without\r\ncoming nearer. At last we came to the beach, where the boats where\r\nwaiting for us. We got in, and, when we were some way from the shore,\r\nthe natives rushed down and shot many arrows; but we then had little\r\nfear of them. We replied with two bombard-shots, more to frighten them\r\nthan to do them harm. They all fled into the woods, and so we took leave\r\nof them, thankful to escape after a dangerous adventure. They all went\r\nnaked like the others. We called this island _the Island of the Giants_,\r\nby reason of their stature.[94]\r\n\r\nWe proceeded onwards along the coast, and there happened to be combats\r\nwith the natives many times, because they did not wish us to take\r\nanything from the land. At length we became desirous of returning to\r\nCastille, having been on the sea for nearly a year[95] and the provisions\r\nbeing nearly exhausted, the little that remained being damaged by the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nFor from the time that we left the islands of Cape Verde until now, we\r\nhad been continually navigating within the Torrid Zone, and twice we\r\nhad crossed the equinoctial line; for, as I said before, we went 5 deg.\r\nbeyond it to the south, and now we were in 15 deg.[96] to the north. Being\r\nin this state of mind, it pleased the Holy Spirit to give us some rest\r\nfrom our great hardships; for as we were searching for a port in which\r\nto repair our ships, we came upon a people who received us with much\r\nfriendship. We found that they had a very great quantity of oriental\r\npearls, and exceedingly good ones. We stayed with them forty-seven days,\r\nand obtained from them 119 marcs of pearls for very little merchandise\r\nin exchange. I believe the pearls did not cost us the value of forty\r\nducats. What we gave them was nothing but bells, and looking-glasses, and\r\nbeads,[97] and ten bells, and tin foil. For one bell a native gave all\r\nthe pearls he had. Here we learnt how they fished for them, and where,\r\nand they gave us many shells in which they are born. We bartered for a\r\nshell in which were born 130 pearls, and in others less. This one of 130\r\nthe Queen took, and others I put aside that they might not be seen. Your\r\nMagnificence must know that if the pearls are not mature, and are not\r\ndetached, they soon perish, and of this I have had experience. When they\r\nare mature, they are detached in the shell, and are placed among the\r\nflesh. These are good. When they were bad the greater part were cracked\r\nand badly bored. Nevertheless they are worth a good deal of money when\r\nsold in the market.\r\n\r\nAt the end of forty-seven days we took leave of these very friendly\r\nnatives. We departed, and, for the sake of obtaining many things of which\r\nwe were in need, we shaped a course for the island of _Antiglia_,[98]\r\nbeing that which Christopher Columbus discovered a few years ago. Here\r\nwe took many supplies on board, and remained two months and seventeen\r\ndays.[99] Here we endured many dangers and troubles from the same\r\nChristians who were in this island with Columbus. I believe this was\r\ncaused by envy; but to avoid prolixity, I will refrain from recounting\r\nwhat happened. We departed from the said island on the 22nd of July,[100]\r\nand after a voyage of a month and a half, we entered the port of Cadiz\r\non the 8th of September,[101] being my second voyage. God be praised.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SECOND VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF ALONSO DE HOJEDA\r\n\r\n(_Respecting his Voyage of 1499-1500_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alonzo de Hojeda_ gave evidence that the true reply to the question is,\r\nthat this witness is the said Hojeda, who was the first man that went\r\nto make discoveries after the said Admiral, and that he discovered the\r\nmainland to the south and coasted it for nearly 200 leagues to Paria,\r\nand went out by the \"Boca del Drago\", and there he knew that the Admiral\r\nhad been at the island of Trinidad, near the \"Boca del Drago\", and that\r\nhe went on and discovered the coast of the mainland as far as the Gulf\r\nof Pearls and the island of Margarita, where he landed, because he knew\r\nthat the Admiral had only sighted it, and thence he proceeded to discover\r\nall the coast of the mainland from \"Los Frayles\" to the \"Islas de\r\nlos Gigantes\", the Gulf of Venecia, which is on the mainland, and the\r\nprovinces of Quinquilacoa. On all that land, from 200 leagues beyond\r\nParia, and from Paria to the Pearls, and from the Pearls to Quinquilacoa,\r\nwhich this witness discovered, no one else had discovered or touched at,\r\nneither the Admiral nor any other person, and in this voyage the said\r\nwitness took with him Juan de la Cosa and Morigo Vespuche, and other\r\npilots, and this witness was despatched for this voyage by order of\r\nthe said Don Juan de Fonseca, Bishop of Palencia, by order of their\r\nHighnesses.[102]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nVOYAGE OF HOJEDA, 1499-1500.\r\n\r\n(_From Navarrete_, iii, pp. 3-11.)\r\n\r\nIn December 1498 the news arrived of the discovery of Paria. The splendid\r\nideas of the discoverer touching the beauty and wealth of that region\r\nwere presently made known, and the spirit of maritime enterprise was\r\nrevived with renewed vigour. Some of those who had sailed with the\r\nAdmiral, and had benefited by his instruction and example, solicited and\r\nobtained from the Court licences to discover, at their own proper cost,\r\nthe regions beyond what was already known, paying into the Treasury a\r\nfourth or fifth part of what they acquired.\r\n\r\nThe first who adventured was Alonso de Hojeda, a native of Cuenca.\r\nOwing to his energy and the favour of the Bishop Don Rodriguez de Fonseca,\r\nhe soon collected the funds and the crews necessary for the equipment of\r\nfour vessels in the Port of Santa Maria, where Juan de la Cosa resided,\r\n\r\na great mariner according to popular ideas, and not inferior to the\r\nAdmiral himself in his own conceit. He had been a shipmate and pupil\r\nof the Admiral in the expedition of Cuba and Jamaica. This man was the\r\nprincipal pilot of Hojeda. They also engaged others who had been in the\r\nParia voyage. Among the other sharers in the enterprise, the Florentine\r\nAmerico Vespucci merits special mention. He was established in Seville,\r\nbut became tired of a mercantile life, and entered upon the study of\r\ncosmography and nautical subjects, with the desire of embracing a more\r\nglorious career. Perhaps this passion was excited by intercourse with the\r\nAdmiral in the house of Juan Berardi, a merchant, and also a Florentine,\r\nand owing to his having become acquainted through this house with the\r\narmaments and provisions for the Indies, so that he desired to place\r\nhis services at the disposal of the commander of the present enterprise.\r\n\r\nWith such useful companions Hojeda put to sea on the 18th[103] or the 20th\r\nof May 1499.[104] They touched at the Canaries, where they took in such\r\nsupplies as they needed, and entered on the ocean voyage from Gomera,\r\nfollowing the route of the last voyage of the Admiral, for Hojeda was in\r\npossession of the marine chart which Columbus had drawn. At the end of\r\ntwenty-four days they came in sight of the continent of the new world,\r\nfurther south than the point reached by the Admiral, and apparently on\r\nthe coast of Surinam. They sailed along in sight of the coast for nearly\r\n200 leagues, from the neighbourhood of the equator to the Gulf of Paria,\r\nwithout landing. In passing, besides other rivers, they saw two very\r\nlarge ones which made the sea water to be fresh for a long distance,\r\none coming from south to north, which should be the river now called\r\nEssequibo in Dutch Guiana, and which was for some time called the _Rio\r\nDulce_. The course of the other was from west to east, and may have\r\nbeen the Orinoco, the waters of which flow for many leagues into the sea\r\nwithout mixing with the salt water. The land on the coast was, generally,\r\nlow and covered with very dense forest. The currents were exceedingly\r\nstrong towards the N. E., following the general direction of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe first inhabited land seen by our navigators was the island of\r\nTrinidad, on the south coast of which they saw a crowd of astonished\r\npeople watching them from the shore. They landed at three different places\r\nwith the launches well provisioned, and twenty-two well-armed men. The\r\nnatives were Caribs, or Cannibals, of fine presence and stature, of great\r\nvigour, and very expert in the use of bows and arrows, and shields, which\r\nwere their proper arms. Although they showed some reluctance to come near\r\nthe Spaniards at first, they were very soon satisfied of the friendly\r\nintentions of the strangers, and bartered with them amicably. Thence\r\nthey entered the Gulf of Paria, and anchored near the river Guarapiche,\r\nwhere they also saw a populous village of peaceful Indians near the\r\nshore. They opened communications with the inhabitants, and, among\r\nother presents, received from them a kind of cider made of fruits, as\r\nwell as some fruit like _mirabolans_, of exquisite flavour, and here\r\nsome pearls were obtained. They saw parrots of various colours; and they\r\nparted company with these people on friendly terms. Hojeda says that they\r\nfound traces of the Admiral having been in the island of Trinidad, near\r\nthe Dragon's Mouth, which circumstance was carefully omitted by Vespucci.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the mouth of the terrible strait, Hojeda continued his\r\ndiscovery along the coast of the mainland as far as the Gulf of Pearls\r\nor Curiana, visiting and landing on the island of Margarita, which is\r\nin front, as he knew that Columbus had only sighted it in passing. In\r\npassing he noticed the islets called _Los Frailes_, which are nine miles\r\nto the east, and north of Margarita, and the rock _Centinela_. Thence he\r\nstood in shore by the cape _Isleos_ (now called _Codera_), anchoring in\r\nthe road which he called _Aldea vencida_. He continued to coast along\r\nfrom port to port, according to the expression of the pilot Morales,\r\nuntil he reached the _Puerto Flechado_, now _Chichirivichi_, where he\r\nseems to have had some encounter with the Indians, who wounded twenty-one\r\nof his men, of whom one died, as soon as he was brought to be cured,\r\nin one of the coves that are between that port and the _Vela de Coro_,\r\nwhere they remained twenty days. From this place they shaped a course\r\nfor the island of Curacoa, which they called _Isla de los Gigantes_,\r\nwhere Americo supposed there was a race of uncommon stature. Perhaps\r\nhe did not understand the expressions of horror with which the natives\r\nreferred to the Caribs, and this sufficed to make Vespucci assert that he\r\nhad seen Pontasiloas and Antaeus.[105] They then crossed to a land which\r\nthey judged to be an island, distant ten leagues from Curacoa, and saw\r\nthe cape forming a peninsula, which they named _San Roman_, probably\r\nbecause it was discovered on the 9th of August, on which the feast of\r\nthat saint is kept. Having rounded the cape, they entered a great gulf,\r\non the eastern side of which, where it is shallow and clear of rocks,\r\nthey saw a great village, with the houses built over the water, on piles\r\ndriven into the bottom, and the people communicated from one to the other\r\nin canoes. Hojeda named it the Gulf of Venice, from its similarity to\r\nthat famous city in Italy. The Indians called it the Gulf of Coquibacoa,\r\nand we know it now as the Gulf of Venezuela. They explored the interior,\r\nand discovered, as it would seem, on the 24th of August, the lake and port\r\nof San Bartolome,[106] now the lake of Maracaibo, where they obtained\r\nsome Indian women of notable beauty and disposition. It is certain that\r\nthe natives of this country had the fame of being more beautiful and\r\ngracious than those of any other part of that continent. Having explored\r\nthe western part of the gulf, and doubled the Cape of Coquibacoa,\r\nHojeda and his companions examined the coast as far as the Cabo de la\r\nVela, the extreme point reached in this voyage. On the 30th of August\r\nthey turned on their homeward voyage for Espanola or Santo Domingo,\r\nand entered the port of Yaquimo on the 5th of September 1499, with the\r\nintention of loading with brasil wood, according to what Don Fernando\r\nColumbus says.\r\n\r\nHere Hojeda had those disputes with Roldan which are referred to by our\r\nhistorians, but, finally, with leave from that chief, Hojeda removed\r\nhis ships to Surana, in February 1500.[107] According to Vespucci, in\r\nhis letter to Medici,[108] they navigated from Espanola in a northerly\r\ndirection for 200 leagues, discovering more than a thousand islands, most\r\nof them inhabited, which would probably be the Lucayos, although those are\r\nnot nearly so numerous. On one of these he says that they violently seized\r\n232 persons for slaves, and that from thence they returned to Spain by the\r\nislands of the Azores, Canary and Madeira, arriving in the Bay of Cadiz\r\nin the middle of June 1500, where they sold many of the 200 slaves that\r\narrived, the rest having died on the voyage. The truth of these events\r\nis not very certain, but it is certain that the profit of the expedition\r\nwas very small. According to the same Vespucci, deducting costs, not more\r\nthan 500 ducats remained to divide among 55 shareholders, and this when,\r\nbesides the price of the slaves, they brought home a quantity of pearls,\r\nworthy of a place in the royal treasury, of gold and some precious stones,\r\nbut not many, for, imitating badly the acts of the Admiral, the desire to\r\npush on for discovery was greater than that for the acquisition of riches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing afterwards in Seville, resting from so many labours that I had\r\nendured during these two voyages, and intending to return to the land of\r\npearls, Fortune showed that she was not content with these my labours.\r\nI know not how there came into the thoughts of the Most Serene King Don\r\nManuel of Portugal the wish to have my services. But being at Seville,\r\nwithout any thought of going to Portugal, a messenger came to me with\r\na letter from the Royal Crown, in which I was asked to come to Lisbon,\r\nto confer with his Highness, who promised to show me favour. I was not\r\ninclined to go, and I despatched the messenger with a reply that I was\r\nnot well, but that when I had recovered, if his Highness still wished\r\nfor my services, I would come as soon as he might send for me. Seeing\r\nthat he could not have me, he arranged to send Giuliano di Bartolomeo\r\ndi Giocondo for me, he being in Lisbon, with instructions that, come\r\nwhat might, he should bring me. The said Giuliano came to Seville,\r\nand prayed so hard that I was forced to go. My departure was taken ill\r\nby many who knew me, for I left Castille where honour was done me, and\r\nwhere the King held me in good esteem. It was worse that I went without\r\nbidding farewell to my host.\r\n\r\nWhen I was presented to that King, he showed his satisfaction that I had\r\ncome, and asked me to go in company with three of his ships that were\r\nready to depart for the discovery of new lands. As the request of a\r\nking is a command, I had to consent to whatever he asked, and we sailed\r\nfrom this port of Lisbon with three ships on the 10th of March 1501,\r\nshaping our course direct for the island of Grand Canary. We passed\r\nwithout sighting it, and continued along the west coast of Africa. On\r\nthis coast we made our fishery of a sort of fish called _parchi_. We\r\nremained three days, and then came to a port on the coast of Ethiopia\r\ncalled _Besechiece_,[109] which is within the Torrid Zone, the North\r\nPole rising above it 14 deg. 30', situated in the first climate. Here we\r\nremained two days, taking in wood and water; for my intention was to\r\nshape a course towards the south, in the Atlantic Gulf. We departed from\r\nthis port of Ethiopia, and steered to the south-west, taking a quarter\r\npoint to the south[110] until, after sixty-seven days, we came in sight\r\nof land, which was 700 leagues from the said port to the south-west.[111]\r\nIn those sixty-seven days we had the worst time that man ever endured who\r\nnavigated the seas, owing to the rains, perturbations, and storms that we\r\nencountered. The season was very contrary to us, by reason of the course\r\nof our navigation being continually in contact with the equinoctial line,\r\nwhere, in the month of June, it is winter. We found that the day and\r\nthe night were equal, and that the shadow was always towards the south.\r\n\r\nIt pleased God to show us a new land on the 17th of August, and we\r\nanchored at a distance of half a league, and got our boats out. We then\r\nwent to see the land, whether it was inhabited, and what it was like. We\r\nfound that it was inhabited by people who were worse than animals. But\r\nyour Magnificence must understand that we did not see them at first,\r\nthough we were convinced that the country was inhabited, by many signs\r\nobserved by us. We took possession for that Most Serene King; and found\r\nthe land to be very pleasant and fertile, and of good appearance. It was\r\n5 deg. to the south of the equinoctial line. We went back to the ships, and\r\nas we were in great want of wood and water, we determined, next day, to\r\nreturn to the shore, with the object of obtaining what we wanted. Being\r\non shore, we saw some people at the top of a hill, who were looking\r\nat us, but without showing any intention of coming down. They were\r\nnaked, and of the same colour and form as the others we had seen. We\r\ntried to induce them to come and speak with us, but did not succeed,\r\nas they would not trust us. Seeing their obstinacy, and it being late,\r\nwe returned on board, leaving many bells and mirrors on shore, and other\r\nthings in their sight. As soon as we were at some distance on the sea,\r\nthey came down from the hill, and showed themselves to be much astonished\r\nat the things. On that day we were only able to obtain water.\r\n\r\nNext morning we saw from the ship that the people on shore had made a\r\ngreat smoke, and thinking it was a signal to us, we went on shore, where\r\nwe found that many people had come, but they still kept at a distance from\r\nus. They made signs to us that we should come inland with them. Two of\r\nour Christians were, therefore, sent to ask their captain for leave to go\r\nwith them a short distance inland, to see what kind of people they were,\r\nand if they had any riches, spices, or drugs. The captain was contented,\r\nso they got together many things for barter, and parted from us, with\r\ninstructions that they should not be more than five days absent, as we\r\nwould wait that time for them. So they set out on their road inland,\r\nand we returned to the ships to wait for them. Nearly every day people\r\ncame to the beach, but they would not speak with us. On the seventh day\r\nwe went on shore, and found that they had arranged with their women; for,\r\nas we jumped on shore, the men of the land sent many of their women to\r\nspeak with us. Seeing that they were not reassured, we arranged to send\r\nto them one of our people, who was a very agile and valiant youth. To\r\ngive them more confidence, the rest of us went back into the boats. He\r\nwent among the women, and they all began to touch and feel him, wondering\r\nat him exceedingly. Things being so, we saw a woman come from the hill,\r\ncarrying a great stick in her hand.[112] When she came to where our\r\nChristian stood, she raised it, and gave him such a blow that he was\r\nfelled to the ground. The other women immediately took him by the feet,\r\nand dragged him towards the hill. The men rushed down to the beach,\r\nand shot at us with their bows and arrows. Our people, in great fear,\r\nhauled the boats towards their anchors,[113] which were on shore; but,\r\nowing to the quantities of arrows that came into the boats, no one thought\r\nof taking up their arms. At last, four rounds from the bombard were fired\r\nat them, and they no sooner heard the report than they all ran away\r\ntowards the hill, where the women were still tearing the Christian to\r\npieces. At a great fire they had made they roasted him before our eyes,\r\nshowing us many pieces, and then eating them. The men made signs how they\r\nhad killed the other two Christians and eaten them. What shocked us much\r\nwas seeing with our eyes the cruelty with which they treated the dead,\r\nwhich was an intolerable insult to all of us.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged that more than forty of us should land and avenge such\r\ncruel murder, and so bestial and inhuman an act, the principal captain\r\nwould not give his consent. We departed from them unwillingly, and with\r\nmuch shame, caused by the decision of our captain.\r\n\r\nWe left this place, and commenced our navigation by shaping a course\r\nbetween east and south. Thus we sailed along the land, making many\r\nlandings, seeing natives, but having no intercourse with them. We\r\nsailed on until we found that the coast made a turn to the west when\r\nwe had doubled a cape, to which we gave the name of the _Cape of St.\r\nAugustine_.[114] We then began to shape a course to the south-west.\r\nThe cape is distant from the place where the Christians were murdered 150\r\nleagues towards the east, and this cape is 8 deg. from the equinoctial line\r\nto the south. In navigating we saw one day a great multitude of people\r\non the beach, gazing at the wonderful sight of our ships. As we sailed\r\nwe turned the ship towards them, anchored in a good place, and went on\r\nshore with the boats. We found the people to be better conditioned than\r\nthose we had met with before, and, responding to our overtures, they\r\nsoon made friends, and treated with us. We were five days in this place,\r\nand found _canna fistola_ very thick and green, and dry on the tops of\r\nthe trees. We determined to take a pair of men from this place, that\r\nthey might teach us their language, and three of them came voluntarily\r\nto go to Portugal.\r\n\r\nLest your Magnificence should be tired of so much writing, you must know\r\nthat, on leaving this port, we sailed along on a westerly course, always\r\nin sight of land, continually making many landings, and speaking with\r\nan infinite number of people. We were so far south that we were outside\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn, where the South Pole rises above the horizon\r\n32 deg. We had lost sight altogether of _Ursa Minor_ and _Ursa Major_,\r\nwhich were far below and scarcely seen on the horizon.[115] We guided\r\nourselves by the stars of the South Pole, which are numerous and much\r\nlarger and brighter than those of our Pole. I traced the figure of the\r\ngreater part of those of the first magnitude, with a declaration of their\r\norbits round the South Pole, and of their diameters and semi-diameters,\r\nas may be seen in my FOUR VOYAGES. We sailed along that coast for 750\r\nleagues, 150 from the cape called _St. Augustine_, to the west, and 600\r\nto the south.\r\n\r\nDesiring to recount the things I saw on that coast, and what happened\r\nto us, as many more leaves would not suffice me. On the coast we saw an\r\ninfinite number of trees, brazil wood[116] and _cassia_, and those trees\r\nwhich yield myrrh, as well as other marvels of nature which I am unable\r\nto recount. Having now been ten months on the voyage, and having seen\r\nthat there was no mining wealth whatever in that land, we decided upon\r\ntaking leave of it, and upon sailing across the sea for some other part.\r\nHaving held a consultation, it was decided that the course should be\r\ntaken which seemed good to me; and the command of the fleet was entrusted\r\nto me. I gave orders that the fleet should be supplied with wood and\r\nwater for six months, such being the decision of the officers of the\r\nships. Having made our departure from this land, we began our navigation\r\nwith a southerly course on the 15th of February, when already the sun\r\nmoved towards the equinoctial, and turned towards our Hemisphere of the\r\nNorth. We sailed so far on this course that we found ourselves where the\r\nSouth Pole had a height above our horizon of 52 deg. and we could no longer\r\nsee the stars of _Ursa Minor_ or of _Ursa Major_. We were then 500 leagues\r\nto the south of the port whence we had departed, and this was on the 3rd\r\nof April. On this day such a tempest arose on the sea that all our sails\r\nwere blown away, and we ran under bare poles, with a heavy southerly gale\r\nand a tremendous sea; the air being very tempestuous. The gale was such\r\nthat all the people in the fleet were much alarmed. The nights were very\r\nlong, for the night we had on the 7th of April lasted fifteen hours,\r\nthe sun being at the end of Aries, and in that region it was winter,\r\nas your Magnificence will be well aware. Sailing in this storm, on the\r\n7th of April we came in sight of new land,[117] along which we ran for\r\nnearly 20 leagues, and found it all a rocky coast, without any port or\r\ninhabitants. I believe this was because the cold was so great that no one\r\nin the fleet could endure it. Finding ourselves in such peril, and in such\r\na storm that we could scarcely see one ship from another, owing to the\r\ngreatness of the waves and the blinding mist, it was agreed with the\r\nprincipal captain that a signal should be made to the ships that they\r\nshould make for land, and then shape a course for Portugal. This was\r\nvery good counsel, for it is certain that if we had delayed another\r\nnight all would have been lost; for, as we wore round on the next day,\r\nwe were met by such a storm that we expected to be swamped. We had to\r\nundertake pilgrimages and perform other ceremonies, as is the custom\r\nof sailors at such times. We ran for five days, always coming towards\r\nthe equinoctial line, where the air and sea became more temperate. It\r\npleased God to deliver us from such peril. Our course was now between\r\nthe north and north-east, for our intention was to reach the coast of\r\nEthiopia, our distance from it being 300 leagues, in the Gulf of the\r\nAtlantic Sea. By the grace of God, on the 10th day of May, we came in\r\nsight of land, where we were able to refresh ourselves, the land being\r\ncalled _La Serra Liona_. We were there fifteen days, and thence shaped\r\na course to the islands of the _Azores_, which are distant nearly 750\r\nleagues from that _Serra_. We reached the islands in the end of July,\r\nwhere we remained fifteen days taking some recreation. Thence we departed\r\nfor Lisbon, distant 300 leagues to the west, and arrived at that port of\r\nLisbon on the 7th of September 1502, may God be thanked for our salvation,\r\nwith only two ships. We burnt the other at _Serra Liona_, because she\r\nwas no longer seaworthy. We were employed on this voyage nearly fifteen\r\nmonths; and for eleven days we navigated without seeing the North Star,\r\nnor the Great or Little Bears, which they call _el corno_, and we were\r\nguided by the stars of the other Pole. This is what I saw on this voyage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter on his Third Voyage from_ AMERIGO VESPUCCI _to_ LORENZO PIETRO\r\nFRANCESCO DI MEDICI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              _March (or April) 1503._\r\n\r\nAlberico Vesputio to Lorenzo Pietro di Medici, salutation. In passed\r\ndays I wrote very fully to you of my return from the new countries,\r\nwhich have been found and explored with the ships, at the cost, and by\r\nthe command, of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to\r\ncall it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our\r\nancestors, and to all who hear about them they will be entirely new.\r\nFor the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world\r\nbeyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea,\r\nwhich they have called the Atlantic; and if they have affirmed that any\r\ncontinent is there, they have given many reasons for denying that it\r\nis inhabited. But this their opinion is false, and entirely opposed to\r\nthe truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent\r\nin that southern part; more populous and more full of animals than our\r\nEurope, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any\r\nother region known to us, as will be explained further on. I shall write\r\nsuccinctly of the principal things only, and the things most worthy of\r\nnotice and of being remembered, which I either saw or heard of in this\r\nnew world, as presently will become manifest.\r\n\r\nWe set out, on a prosperous voyage, on the 14th of May[118] 1501,\r\nsailing from Lisbon, by order of the aforesaid King, with three ships,\r\nto discover new countries towards the west; and we sailed towards the\r\nsouth continuously for twenty months.[119] Of this navigation the order\r\nis as follows: Our course was for the Fortunate Islands, so called\r\nformerly, but now we call them the Grand Canary Islands, which are in\r\nthe third climate, and on the confines of the inhabited west. Thence we\r\nsailed rapidly over the ocean along the coast of Africa and part of\r\nEthiopia to the Ethiopic Promontory, so called by Ptolemy, which is\r\nnow called Cape Verde, and by the Ethiopians _Biseghier_, and that\r\ncountry _Mandraga_, 13 deg. within the Torrid Zone, on the north side of\r\nthe equinoctial line. The country is inhabited by a black race. Having\r\ntaken on board what we required, we weighed our anchors and made sail,\r\ntaking our way across the vast ocean towards the Antarctic Pole, with some\r\nwesting. From the day when we left the before-mentioned promontory, we\r\nsailed for the space of two months and three days.[120] Hitherto no land\r\nhad appeared to us in that vast sea. In truth, how much we had suffered,\r\nwhat dangers of shipwreck, I leave to the judgment of those to whom the\r\nexperience of such things is very well known. What a thing it is to seek\r\nunknown lands, and how difficult, being ignorant, to narrate briefly what\r\nhappened. It should be known that, of the sixty-seven days of our voyage,\r\nwe were navigating continuously forty-four. We had copious thunderstorms\r\nand perturbations, and it was so dark that we never could see either the\r\nsun in the day or the moon at night. This caused us great fear, so that\r\nwe lost all hope of life. In these most terrible dangers of the sea it\r\npleased the Most High to show us the continent and the new countries,\r\nbeing another unknown world. These things being in sight, we were as\r\nmuch rejoiced as anyone may imagine who, after calamity and ill-fortune,\r\nhas obtained safety.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 7th August[121] 1501, that we reached those countries,\r\nthanking our Lord God with solemn prayers, and celebrating a choral\r\nMass. We knew that land to be a continent, and not an island, from its\r\nlong beaches extending without trending round, the infinite number of\r\ninhabitants, the numerous tribes and peoples, the numerous kinds of wild\r\nanimals unknown in our country, and many others never seen before by us,\r\ntouching which it would take long to make reference. The clemency of God\r\nwas shown forth to us by being brought to these regions; for the ships\r\nwere in a leaking state, and in a few days our lives might have been lost\r\nin the sea. To Him be the honour and glory, and the grace of the action.\r\n\r\nWe took counsel, and resolved to navigate along the coast of this\r\ncontinent towards the east, and never to lose sight of the land. We sailed\r\nalong until we came to a point where the coast turned to the south. The\r\ndistance from the landfall to this point was nearly 300 leagues.[122]\r\nIn this stretch of coast we often landed, and had friendly relations\r\nwith the natives,[123] as I shall presently relate. I had forgotten to\r\ntell you that from Cape Verde to the first land of this continent the\r\ndistance is nearly 700 leagues; although I estimate that we went over more\r\nthan 1,800, partly owing to ignorance of the route, and partly owing to\r\nthe tempests and foul winds which drove us off our course, and sent us\r\nin various directions. If my companions had not trusted in me, to whom\r\ncosmography was known, no one, not the leader of our navigation, would\r\nhave known where we were after running 500 leagues. We were wandering\r\nand full of errors, and only the instruments for taking the altitudes\r\nof heavenly bodies showed us our position. These were the quadrant and\r\nastrolabe, as known to all. These have been much used by me with much\r\nhonour; for I showed them that a knowledge of the marine chart, and the\r\nrules taught by it, are more worth than all the pilots in the world. For\r\nthese pilots have no knowledge beyond those places to which they have\r\noften sailed. Where the said point of land showed us the trend of the\r\ncoast to the south, we agreed to continue our voyage, and to ascertain\r\nwhat there might be in those regions. We sailed along the coast for\r\nnearly 500 leagues, often going on shore and having intercourse with the\r\nnatives, who received us in a brotherly manner. We sometimes stayed with\r\nthem for fifteen or twenty days continuously, as friends and guests, as\r\nI shall relate presently. Part of this continent is in the Torrid Zone,\r\nbeyond the equinoctial line towards the South Pole. But it begins at 8 deg.\r\nbeyond the equinoctial. We sailed along the coast so far that we crossed\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn, and found ourselves where the Antarctic Pole\r\nwas 50 deg. above our horizon. We went towards the Antarctic Circle until\r\nwe were 17 deg. 30' from it[124]; all which I have seen, and I have known\r\nthe nature of those people, their customs, the resources and fertility\r\nof the land, the salubrity of the air, the positions of the celestial\r\nbodies in the heavens, and, above all, the fixed stars, over an eighth\r\nof the sphere, never seen by our ancestors, as I shall explain below.\r\n\r\nAs regards the people: we have found such a multitude in those countries\r\nthat no one could enumerate them, as we read in the Apocalypse. They are\r\npeople gentle and tractable, and all of both sexes go naked, not covering\r\nany part of their bodies, just as they came from their mothers' wombs,\r\nand so they go until their deaths. They have large, square-built bodies,\r\nand well proportioned. Their colour reddish, which I think is caused by\r\ntheir going naked and exposed to the sun. Their hair is plentiful and\r\nblack. They are agile in walking, and of quick sight. They are of a\r\nfree and good-looking expression of countenance, which they themselves\r\ndestroy by boring the nostrils and lips, the nose and ears; nor must\r\nyou believe that the borings are small, nor that they only have one,\r\nfor I have seen those who had no less than seven borings in the face,\r\neach one the size of a plum. They stop up these perforations with blue\r\nstones, bits of marble, of crystal, or very fine alabaster, also with\r\nvery white bones and other things artificially prepared according to their\r\ncustoms; which, if you could see, it would appear a strange and monstrous\r\nthing. One had in the nostrils and lips alone seven stones, of which some\r\nwere half a palm in length. It will astonish you to hear that I considered\r\nthat the weight of seven such stones was as much as sixteen ounces. In\r\neach ear they had three perforations bored, whence they had other stones\r\nand rings suspended. This custom is only for the men, as the women do\r\nnot perforate their faces, but only their ears. Another custom among\r\nthem is sufficiently shameful, and beyond all human credibility. Their\r\nwomen, being very libidinous, make the penis of their husbands swell to\r\nsuch a size as to appear deformed; and this is accomplished by a certain\r\nartifice, being the bite of some poisonous animal, and by reason of this\r\nmany lose their virile organ and remain eunuchs.\r\n\r\nThey have no cloth, either of wool, flax, or cotton, because they have\r\nno need of it; nor have they any private property, everything being\r\nin common. They live amongst themselves without a king or ruler, each\r\nman being his own master, and having as many wives as they please. The\r\nchildren cohabit with the mothers, the brothers with the sisters, the\r\nmale cousins with the female, and each one with the first he meets.\r\nThey have no temples and no laws, nor are they idolaters. What more\r\ncan I say! They live according to nature, and are more inclined to be\r\nEpicurean than Stoic. They have no commerce among each other, and they\r\nwage war without art or order. The old men make the youths do what they\r\nplease, and incite them to fights, in which they mutually kill with\r\ngreat cruelty. They slaughter those who are captured, and the victors\r\neat the vanquished; for human flesh is an ordinary article of food\r\namong them. You may be the more certain of this, because I have seen\r\na man eat his children and wife; and I knew a man who was popularly\r\ncredited to have eaten 300 human bodies. I was once in a certain city\r\nfor twenty-seven days, where human flesh was hung up near the houses,\r\nin the same way as we expose butcher's meat. I say further that they were\r\nsurprised that we did not eat our enemies, and use their flesh as food,\r\nfor they say it is excellent. Their arms are bows and arrows, and when\r\nthey go to war they cover no part of their bodies, being in this like\r\nbeasts. We did all we could to persuade them to desist from their evil\r\nhabits, and they promised us to leave off. The women, as I have said,\r\ngo naked, and are very libidinous, yet their bodies are comely; but they\r\nare as wild as can be imagined.\r\n\r\nThey live for 150 years, and are rarely sick. If they are attacked by\r\na disease they cure themselves with the roots of some herbs. These are\r\nthe most noteworthy things I know about them.\r\n\r\nThe air in this country is temperate and good, as we were able to learn\r\nfrom their accounts that there are never any pestilences or epidemics\r\ncaused by bad air. Unless they meet with violent deaths, their lives\r\nare long. I believe this is because a southerly wind is always blowing,\r\na south wind to them being what a north wind is to us. They are expert\r\nfishermen, and the sea is full of all kinds of fish. They are not hunters;\r\nI think because here there are many kinds of wild animals, principally\r\nlions and bears, innumerable serpents, and other horrible creatures and\r\ndeformed beasts; also because there are vast forests and trees of immense\r\nsize. They have not the courage to face such dangers naked and without\r\nany defence.\r\n\r\nThe land is very fertile, abounding in many hills and valleys, and in\r\nlarge rivers, and is irrigated by very refreshing springs. It is covered\r\nwith extensive and dense forests, which are almost impenetrable, and\r\nfull of every kind of wild beast. Great trees grow without cultivation,\r\nof which many yield fruits pleasant to the taste and nourishing to the\r\nhuman body; and a great many have an opposite effect. The fruits are\r\nunlike those in our country; and there are innumerable different kinds\r\nof fruits and herbs, of which they make bread and excellent food. They\r\nalso have many seeds unlike ours. No kind of metal has been found except\r\ngold, in which the country abounds, though we have brought none back in\r\nthis our first navigation. The natives, however, assured us that there\r\nwas an immense quantity of gold underground, and nothing was to be had\r\nfrom them for a price. Pearls abound, as I wrote to you.\r\n\r\nIf I was to attempt to write of all the species of animals, it would\r\nbe a long and tedious task. I believe certainly that our Pliny did not\r\ntouch upon a thousandth part of the animals and birds that exist in this\r\nregion; nor could an artist such as Policletus,[125] succeed in painting\r\nthem. All the trees are odoriferous, and some of them emit gums, oils,\r\nor other liquors. If they were our property, I do not doubt but that\r\nthey would be useful to man. If the terrestrial paradise is in some part\r\nof this land, it cannot be very far from the coast we visited. It is,\r\nas I have told you, in a climate where the air is temperate at noon,\r\nbeing neither cold in winter nor hot in summer.\r\n\r\nThe sky and air are serene during a great part of the year. Thick vapours,\r\nwith fine rain falling, last for three or four hours and then disappear\r\nlike smoke. The sky is adorned with most beautiful signs and figures,\r\nin which I have noted as many as twenty stars as bright as we sometimes\r\nsee Venus and Jupiter. I have considered the orbits and motions of these\r\nstars, and I have measured the circumference and diameters of the stars\r\nby a geometrical method,[126] ascertaining which were the largest. I\r\nsaw in the heaven three _Canopi_, two certainly bright, and the other\r\nobscure. The Antarctic Pole is not figured with a Great Bear and a Little\r\nBear, like our Arctic Pole, nor is any bright star seen near it, and\r\nof those which go round in the shortest circuit there are three which\r\nhave the figure of the orthogonous triangle, of which the smallest has\r\na diameter of 9 half-degrees. To the east of these is seen a _Canopus_\r\nof great size, and white, which, when in mid-heaven, has this figure:--\r\n\r\n      *                       s s\r\n                            s s s s\r\n                          s s s s s s\r\n                            s s s s\r\n                                       canopus\r\n      *                        *\r\n\r\nAfter these come two others, of which the half-circumference, the\r\ndiameter, has 12 half-degrees; and with them is seen another Canopus.\r\nTo these succeed six other most beautiful and very bright stars, beyond\r\nall the others of the eighth sphere, which, in the superficies of the\r\nheaven, have half the circumference, the diameter 32 deg., and with them\r\nis one black Canopus of immense size, seen in the Milky Way, and they\r\nhave this shape when they are on the meridian:--\r\n\r\n                       *\r\n      *    *    *                *\r\n                 s s\r\n              s s s s s\r\n             s s s s s s\r\n                s s s\r\n                       *\r\n\r\nI have known many other very beautiful stars, which I have diligently\r\nnoted down, and have described very well in a certain little book\r\ndescribing this my navigation, which at present is in the possession\r\nof that Most Serene King, and I hope he will restore it to me. In\r\nthat hemisphere I have seen things not compatible with the opinions\r\nof philosophers. Twice I have seen a white rainbow towards the middle\r\nof the night, which was not only observed by me, but also by all the\r\nsailors. Likewise we often saw the new moon on the day on which it is\r\nin conjunction with the sun. Every night, in that part of the heavens\r\nof which we speak, there were innumerable vapours and burning meteors.\r\nI have told you, a little way back, that, in the hemisphere of which\r\nwe are speaking, it is not a complete hemisphere in respect to ours,\r\nbecause it does not take that form so that it may be properly called so.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as I have said, from Lisbon, whence we started, the distance\r\nfrom the equinoctial line is 39 deg., and we navigated beyond the equinoctial\r\nline to 50 deg., which together make 90 deg., which is one quarter of a great\r\ncircle, according to the true measurement handed down to us by the\r\nancients, so that it is manifest that we must have navigated over a\r\nfourth part of the earth. By this reasoning, we who inhabit Lisbon, at\r\na distance of 39 deg. from the equinoctial line in north latitude, are to\r\nthose who live under 50 deg. beyond the same line, in meridional length,\r\nangularly 5 deg. on a transverse line. I will explain this more clearly: a\r\nperpendicular line, while we stand upright, if suspended from a point of\r\nthe heavens exactly vertical, hangs over our heads; but it hangs over them\r\nsideways. Thus, while we are on a right line, they are on a transverse\r\nline. An orthogonal triangle is thus formed, of which we have the right\r\nline, but the base and hypotenuse to them seems the vertical line, as\r\nin this figure it will appear. This will suffice as regards cosmography.\r\n\r\n                              Vertex[127] of our heads.\r\n                                         _.-'|\r\n                                     _.-'    |\r\n                    Hypotenuse.  _.-'        | Us.\r\n                             _.-'            |\r\n    Vertex[127] of       _.-'                |\r\n    their heads.     _.-'____________________|\r\n                                 Them.\r\n\r\nThese are the most notable things that I have seen in this my last\r\nnavigation, or, as I call it, the third voyage. For the other two voyages\r\nwere made by order of the Most Serene King of Spain to the west, in which\r\nI noted many wonderful works of God, our Creator; and if I should have\r\ntime, I intend to collect all these singular and wonderful things into a\r\ngeographical or cosmographical book, that my record may live with future\r\ngenerations; and the immense work of the omnipotent God will be known, in\r\nparts still unknown, but known to us. I also pray that the most merciful\r\nGod will prolong my life that, with His good grace, I may be able to make\r\nthe best disposition of this my wish. I keep the other two journeys in\r\nmy sanctuary, and the Most Serene King restoring to me the third journey,\r\nI intend to return to peace and my country. There, in consultation with\r\nlearned persons, and comforted and aided by friends, I shall be able to\r\ncomplete my work.\r\n\r\nI ask your pardon for not having sooner been able to send you this my\r\nlast navigation, as I had promised in my former letters. I believe that\r\nyou will understand the cause, which was that I could not get the books\r\nfrom this Most Serene King. I think of undertaking a fourth voyage in\r\nthe same direction, and promise is already made of two ships with their\r\narmaments, in which I may seek new regions of the East on a course called\r\nAfricus. In which journey I hope much to do God honour, to be of service\r\nto this kingdom, to secure repute for my old age, and I expect no other\r\nresult with the permission of this Most Serene King. May God permit what\r\nis for the best, and you shall be informed of what happens.\r\n\r\nThis letter was translated from the Italian into the Latin language\r\nby Jocundus, interpreter, as everyone understands Latin who desires\r\nto learn about these voyages, and to search into the things of heaven,\r\nand to know all that is proper to be known; for, from the time the world\r\nbegan, so much has not been discovered touching the greatness of the\r\nearth and what is contained in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to relate the things I saw in the fourth voyage; but\r\nas I am already tired, and as the voyage did not end as was intended,\r\nowing to an accident which happened in the Atlantic, as your Magnificence\r\nwill shortly understand, I propose to be brief. We departed from this\r\nport of Lisbon with six ships,[128] having the intention of discovering\r\nan island in the East called Melaccha, of which it was reported that it\r\nwas very rich, and that it was the mart of all the ships that navigate\r\nthe Gangetic and Indian Seas, as Cadiz is the mart for all vessels\r\npassing from east to west or from west to east by way of Galicut. This\r\nMelaccha is more to the west than Galicut, and much more to the south,\r\nfor we know that it is in 33 deg. from the Antarctic Pole.[129] We departed\r\non the 10th of May 1503, and shaped a course direct for the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, where we careened and took in fresh provisions, remaining for\r\nthirteen days. Thence we continued on our voyage, shaping a south-easterly\r\ncourse, and as our commander was a presumptuous and very obstinate man,\r\nhe wanted to go to Serra-liona, in the southern land of AEthiopia, without\r\nany necessity, unless it was to show that he was commander of the six\r\nships, and he acted against the wishes of all the other captains. Thus\r\nnavigating, when we came in sight of the said land the weather was so\r\nbad, with a contrary wind, that we were in sight for four days without\r\nbeing able to reach the place, owing to the storm. The consequence was\r\nthat we were obliged to resume our proper course, and give up the said\r\nSerra, shaping a south-west course. When we had sailed for 300 leagues,\r\nbeing 3 deg. to the south of the equinoctial line, a land was sighted[130]\r\nat a distance of twenty-two leagues, at which we were astonished. We found\r\nthat it was an island in the midst of the sea, very high and wonderful in\r\nits formation, for it was not more than two leagues long and one broad,\r\nand uninhabited. It was an evil island for all the fleet, because your\r\nMagnificence must know that, through the bad advice and management of\r\nour commander, his ship was lost. For, with three in company, he struck\r\non a rock in the night of St. Lawrence, which is on the 10th of August,\r\nand went to the bottom, nothing being saved but the crew. She was a ship\r\nof 300 tons, and the chief importance of the fleet centred in her. As\r\nthe other ships were worn and needed repairs, the commander ordered\r\nme to go to the island in my ship, and find a good anchorage where the\r\nfleet could anchor. As my boat, with nine of my sailors, was employed\r\nin helping the other ships, he did not wish that I should take it, but\r\nthat I should go without it, telling me that I should go by myself. I\r\nleft the fleet in accordance with my orders, without a boat and with less\r\nthan half my sailors, and went to the island, which was at a distance of\r\nfour leagues. I found an excellent port where the fleet could anchor in\r\nperfect security. Here I waited for my captain and the fleet for eight\r\ndays, but they never came. We were very discontented, and the men were\r\nfull of apprehensions which I could not remove. Being in this state of\r\nanxiety, at last, on the eighth day, we saw a ship coming from seaward,\r\nand, fearing that she might not see us, we came out to her, expecting\r\nthat she was bringing my boat and people. When we came up to her, after\r\nsalutes, they told us that the _Capitana_ was gone to the bottom, the\r\ncrew being saved, and that my boat and people remained with the fleet,\r\nwhich had gone to that sea ahead, which was a great trouble to us. What\r\nwill your Magnificence think of my finding myself 1,000 leagues from\r\nLisbon with few men? Nevertheless, we put a bold face on the matter,\r\nand still went ahead. We returned to the island, and filled up with\r\nwood and water by using our consort's boat. We found the island to be\r\nuninhabited, supplied with abundance of fresh water, quantities of trees,\r\nand full of marine and land birds without number. They were so tame that\r\nthey allowed us to take them with our hands. We caught so many that we\r\nloaded a boat with these animals. We saw nothing but very large rats,\r\nlizards with two tails, and some serpents.\r\n\r\nHaving got in our provisions we departed, shaping a course between south\r\nand south-west, for we had an order from the King that any ship parted\r\nfrom the rest of the fleet, or from the Commander-in-Chief, should make\r\nfor the land that was visited in the previous voyage. We discovered a port\r\nto which we gave the name of the Bay of _All Saints_,[131] and it pleased\r\nGod to give us such fine weather that we reached it in seventeen days,\r\nbeing 300 leagues from the island. Here we neither found our commander\r\nnor any of the other ships of the fleet. We waited in this port for\r\ntwo months and four days, and, seeing that there was no arrival, I and\r\nmy consort determined to explore the coast. We sailed onwards for 260\r\nleagues until we reached a harbour where we agreed to build a fort. We\r\ndid so, and left twenty-four Christian men in it who were on board my\r\nconsort, being part of the crew of the _Capitana_ that was lost. We\r\nwere in that harbour five months, building the fort, and loading our\r\nships with brazil-wood. For we were not able to advance further, because\r\nwe had not full crews, and I wanted many necessaries. Having done all\r\nthis, we agreed to return to Portugal, which bore between north-east and\r\nnorth. We left the twenty-four men in the fort, with provisions for six\r\nmonths, twelve bombards, and many other arms. We had made friends with\r\nall the natives round, of whom I have made no mention in this voyage,\r\nnot because we did not see and have intercourse with an infinite number\r\nof tribes: for we went inland with thirty men, for a distance of 40\r\nleagues, and saw so many things that I refrain from recounting them,\r\nreserving them for my FOUR VOYAGES. This land is 18 deg. to the south of the\r\nequinoctial line, and beyond the meridian of Lisbon 37 deg. further to the\r\nwest, according to what was shown by our instruments. All this being done,\r\nwe took leave of the Christians and of that land, and began our navigation\r\nto the north-north-east, with the object of shaping a course for this\r\ncity of Lisbon. After seventy-seven days of many hardships and dangers\r\nwe entered this port on the 18th of June 1504. God be praised. Here we\r\nwere very well received, more so than anyone would believe. For all the\r\ncity had given us up, all the other ships of the fleet having been lost,\r\nowing to the pride and folly of our commander.[132] May God reward him\r\nfor his pride!\r\n\r\nAt present I may be found in Lisbon, not knowing what the King may wish\r\nto do with me, but I greatly desire rest.\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this is Benvenuto di Domenico Benvenuti, who will tell\r\nyour Magnificence of my condition, and of some things which I have left\r\nout to avoid prolixity, for he has seen and heard, God knows, how much\r\nof them.

They\r\nlive, for the most part, very miserably on fish, and go naked. Thence\r\nthey went back with some of these Indians, and went along the coast of\r\nthe said land for 600 leagues, where they met an Indian canoe, which is\r\ncarved out of one piece of wood. It had a sail, and went to the mainland\r\nwith eighty men, with many bows, and targets of a very light but strong\r\nwood. They went to the mainland to take Indians who live there, who do\r\nnot serve them as slaves, but are eaten by them like deer, rabbits, and\r\nother animals. Our people took these Indians. Their bows are made of\r\nebony and their arrows have corals made of the nerves of snakes. Having\r\ntaken this canoe, they returned to the said island, where there came\r\nagainst them a great number of Indians, with bows and arrows in their\r\nhands. They defeated these natives and explored the island, which they\r\nfound very sterile. At noon they came to a plain, which was so covered\r\nwith serpents and snakes and dragons, that it was marvellous. They kept\r\none, as it seemed to them to be a very wonderful thing. This dragon was\r\nlarger than a _cachalote_.[137]\r\n\r\nThe island is intersected by a mountain, one part to the north the other\r\nto the south. The north side is inhabited by these Indians, the other\r\nside by those poisonous animals. They say that none of these serpents\r\never pass to the inhabited part, and in the whole of that side there\r\nare no serpents, nor any similar animals. Having seen this, the said\r\nships departed, and took away seven Indians of that land, good sailors,\r\nand coasted along the coast to a place called Alseshij, and thence for\r\n400 leagues to the westward, when they came to a land where they found\r\nmany houses, out of which came many Indians to receive them and do them\r\nhonour, and they say that one of these had previously predicted that\r\ncertain ships of a great king, to them unknown, would come from the\r\neast and make them all slaves, and that all the strangers were gifted\r\nwith life eternal, and that their persons would be adorned with various\r\ndresses. They say that when their king saw our ships he said: \"Behold,\r\nhere are the ships that I told you of ten years ago.\" This king came\r\nwith a breast-plate of massive gold on his breast and a chain of gold,\r\nand a mask of gold with four golden bells of a mark each at his feet;\r\nand with him came twenty Indians, all with gold masks on their faces,\r\nbeating golden kettle-drums, each weighing thirty marks. When they\r\nsaw the islanders with the Spaniards they began to be disdainful, and\r\nto fight fiercely with our people with poisoned arrows. They numbered\r\n5,000, and 140 of our men had landed. They fell to and cut to pieces\r\nnearly 700 natives, one of ours being killed by an arrow. They came to\r\nthe houses, and took those masks and bells, and arms of the said king,\r\nand 800 marks of gold. They set fire to the houses, and were there\r\nninety-six days, because the three ships that remained were sunk and went\r\nto the bottom. Seeing this, they took out the provisions and stores,\r\nand fortified themselves on shore with a very good tower. Every day\r\nthey fought with the Indians. At night they were within their enclosure,\r\nand in the day they went out in order, and as much as they marched, so\r\nmuch they acquired. But they did not dare to go out of their quarters.\r\nOne day they went to a lake, and began to wash the earth with certain\r\n_vernicali_,[138] each one in half an hour getting six, seven, or eight\r\n_castellanos_ of gold. They were told by some of the Indian prisoners\r\nthat they need not tire themselves with washing, for that from there to\r\na very high mountain the distance was half a league, and that in a plain\r\nnear there was a river, where it is not necessary to wash much, for each\r\nman in a day can gather ten marks of gold with little trouble. At length,\r\nas lost men, without hope of returning home, they repaired the ships and\r\nboats that were run up on the beach, eventually determining to return to\r\nSpain. During the time of ninety-six days that they were there several\r\ndied from sickness, and there were forty-four survivors who were saved\r\nwith the help of God. They left ten men in the tower, supplied with\r\nprovisions and stores for a year, who were attacked three times by\r\nIndians with their canoes, but were always victorious, and have come\r\nsafely here to the Court. I have seen all that gold and various things\r\nthat they have brought back; another kind of pepper, but larger than\r\nours, and nuts like nutmegs. They have also brought seventy pearls, all\r\ngood green ones, and some of ten and twelve carats, round, and like[139]\r\nIndian pearls bored in the middle. They have also found and brought a\r\ngreen stone like jasper, four fingers in length, and others worn on the\r\nlips of the people. They are generally without beards.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop intends to send the said two captains, with eight ships\r\nand four hundred men, very well furnished with arms, artillery, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Letter of Naturalization in the Kingdoms of Castille and Leon\r\nin favour of_ VESPUCCI.[140]\r\n\r\nDona Juana by the Grace of God:--To do good and show grace to you,\r\nAmerigo Vespucci, Florentine, in recognition of your fidelity and of\r\ncertain good service you have done, and which I expect that you will\r\ndo from henceforward, by this present I make you a native of these\r\nmy kingdoms of Castille and of Leon, and that you may be able to hold\r\nany public offices that you may have been given or charged with, and\r\nthat you may be able to enjoy and may enjoy all the honours, favours,\r\nand liberties, pre-eminences, prerogatives and immunities, and all other\r\nthings, and each one of them, which you would be able or would be bound\r\nto have and enjoy if you were born in these kingdoms and lordships.\r\n\r\nBy this my letter, and by its duplicate signed by a public notary, I order\r\nthe most illustrious Prince Don Carlos, my very dear and well-beloved son,\r\nand the Infants, Dukes, Prelates, Counts, Marquises, Ricos-Hombres,\r\nMasters of the Orders, those of my Council, the judges of my courts,\r\nthe magistrates of my house and court, the friars, commanders and\r\nsub-commanders of the orders, governors of castles and forts, the\r\ncouncillors, governors, assistant-governors, officers, knights, esquires,\r\nand citizens of all my cities, towns, and villages of these my kingdoms\r\nand lordships, and all others my subjects, of whatsoever condition,\r\npre-eminence, or dignity they be or may be, that they shall consider\r\nyou as a native of these my kingdoms and lordships, as if you had been\r\nborn and brought up in them, and leave you to hold such public and royal\r\noffices and posts as may be given and entrusted to you, and such other\r\nthings as you shall have an interest in, the same as if you had been born\r\nand bred in these kingdoms; and they shall maintain and cause to maintain\r\nthe said honours, favours, freedoms, liberties, exemptions, pre-eminences,\r\nprerogatives and immunities, and all other things, and each one of them,\r\nthat you may or ought to have and enjoy, being native of these the said my\r\nkingdoms and lordships, and that neither on them nor on any part of them\r\nshall they place, or consent to be placed, any impediment against you.\r\n\r\nThus I order that it shall be done, any laws or ordinances of these\r\nmy kingdoms to the contrary notwithstanding, as to which or to each\r\nof them of my proper motion and certain knowledge, and absolute royal\r\npower, such as I choose to use as Queen and Natural Lady of this part,\r\nI dispense so far as they touch these presents, leaving them in force\r\nand vigour for all other things henceforward.\r\n\r\nGiven in the city of Toro, on the 24th day of April, in the year of the\r\nbirth of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1505 years.

And for a remedy to the above, and because it is\r\nnecessary, as well for that navigation as for other voyages by which,\r\nwith the help of our Lord, we hope to make new discoveries in other lands,\r\nthat there should be persons who are more expert and better instructed,\r\nand who know the things necessary for such navigation, so that those\r\nwho are under them may go more safely, it is our will and pleasure, and\r\nwe order that all the pilots of our kingdoms and lordships, who are now\r\nor shall hereafter be appointed as pilots in the said navigation to the\r\nislands and mainland that we possess in the parts of the Indies, and in\r\nother parts of the Ocean Sea, shall be instructed and shall know what\r\nit is necessary for them to know respecting the quadrant and astrolabe,\r\nin order that, by uniting theory with practice, they may be able to\r\nmake good use of them in the said voyages made to the said parts, and,\r\nwithout such knowledge, no one shall go in the said ships as pilots,\r\nnor receive pay as pilots, nor may the masters receive them on board ship,\r\nuntil they have first been examined by you, Amerigo Despuchi, our Chief\r\nPilot, and they shall be given by you a certificate of examination\r\nand approval touching the knowledge of each one. Holding the said\r\ncertificates, we order that they shall be taken and received as expert\r\npilots by whoever is shown them, for it is our pleasure that you shall\r\nbe examiner of the said pilots.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that those who have not the knowledge may more easily learn,\r\nwe order that you are to teach them, in your house in Seville, all\r\nthose things that they ought to know, you receiving payment for your\r\ntrouble. And as it may happen that now, in the beginning, there may be a\r\nscarcity of passed pilots, and some ships may be detained for the want\r\nof them, causing loss and harm to the citizens of the said islands, as\r\nwell as to merchants and other persons who trade thither, we order you,\r\nthe said Amerigo, and we give you licence that you may select the most\r\nefficient pilots from among those who have been there, that for one or\r\ntwo voyages, or for a certain period, they may supply what is necessary,\r\nwhile those others acquire the knowledge that they have to learn, so\r\nthat there may be time for them to learn what is needed.\r\n\r\nIt is also reported to us that there are many charts, by different\r\nmasters, on which are delineated the lands and islands of the Indies, to\r\nus belonging, which by our order have recently been discovered, and that\r\nthese charts differ very much one from another, as well in the routes\r\nas in the delineations of coasts, which may cause much inconvenience. In\r\norder that there may be uniformity, it is our pleasure, and we order that\r\nthere shall be made a general chart (_Padron General_), and that it may\r\nbe more accurate, we order our officers of the House of _Contratacion_\r\nat Seville that they shall assemble all the ablest pilots that are to\r\nbe found in the country at the time, and that, in the presence of you,\r\nAmerigo Despuchi, our Chief Pilot, a _padron_ of all the lands and\r\nislands of the Indies that have hitherto been discovered belonging to our\r\nkingdoms and lordships shall be made; and that for it, after consulting\r\nand reasoning with those pilots, and in accord with you, the said Chief\r\nPilot, a general _padron_ shall be constructed, which shall be called\r\nthe _Padron Real_, by which all pilots shall be ruled and governed, and\r\nthat it shall be in the possession of the aforesaid our officers, and\r\nof you, our Chief Pilot; and that no pilot shall use any other chart,\r\nbut only one which has been taken from the _Padron Real_, on pain of a\r\nfine of fifty _dobles_ towards the works of the House of _Contratacion_\r\nof the Indies in the city of Seville.\r\n\r\nWe further order all the pilots of our kingdoms and lordships who,\r\nfrom this time forward, shall go to the said our lands of the Indies,\r\ndiscovered or to be discovered, that, when they find new lands, islands,\r\nbays, or harbours, or anything else, that they make a note of them for\r\nthe said _Padron Real_, and on arriving in Castille that they shall give\r\nan account to you, the said our Chief Pilot, and to the officers of the\r\nHouse of _Contratacion_ of Seville, that all may be delineated properly\r\non the said _Padron Real_, with the object that navigators may be better\r\ntaught and made expert in navigation. We further order that none of\r\nour pilots who navigate the Ocean Sea, from this time forward, shall\r\ngo without their quadrant and astrolabe and the rules for working them,\r\nunder the penalty that those who do not comply be rendered incompetent\r\nto exercise the said employment during our pleasure, and they shall not\r\nresume such employment without our special licence, paying a fine of\r\n10,000 maravedis towards the works of the said House of _Contratacion_\r\nat Seville. Amerigo Despuchi shall use and exercise the said office of\r\nour Chief Pilot, and you are empowered to do so, and you shall do all\r\nthe things contained in this letter, and which appertain to the said\r\noffice; and by this our letter, and by its copy attested by the public\r\nnotary, we order the Prince Charles, our very dear and well-beloved\r\nson, the Infantes, Dukes, Prelates, Counts, Marquises, Ricos-Hombres,\r\nMasters of Orders, Members of Council, and Judges of our Courts\r\nand Chancelleries, and the other priors, commanders, sub-commanders,\r\ncastellans of our castles and forts, the magistrates, officers of justice,\r\nknights, esquires, officers, and good men of all the cities, towns,\r\nand villages of our kingdoms and lordships, and all captains of ships,\r\nmaster mariners, pilots, mates, and all other persons whom our letter\r\nconcerns or may concern, that you have and hold as our Chief Pilot,\r\nand consent and allow him to hold the said office, and to do and comply\r\nwith all the things in this our letter or appertaining to it; and for\r\ntheir accomplishment and execution give all the favour and help that is\r\nneedful for all that is here, and for each part of it; and that the above\r\nmay come to the knowledge of all, and that none may pretend ignorance,\r\nwe order that this our letter shall be read before the public notary,\r\nin the markets and open spaces, and other accustomed places in the said\r\ncity of Seville, and in the city of Cadiz, and in all the other cities,\r\ntowns, and villages of these kingdoms and lordships; and if hereafter\r\nany person or persons act against it, the said justices shall execute\r\nupon them the penalties contained in this letter, so that the above\r\nshall be observed and shall take effect without fail; and if the one or\r\nthe others do not so comply, they shall be subject to a fine of 10,000\r\nmaravedis for our chamber.

He saw it on\r\nWednesday, the 1st of August, one day after he discovered the island of\r\nTrinidad, in the year of our salvation, 1498.[141] He gave it the name\r\nof Isla Santa, believing that it was an island. He then began to enter\r\nthe Gulf of La Bellena, by the entrance called the mouth of the Serpent\r\nby him, finding all the water fresh, and it is this entrance which forms\r\nthe island of Trinidad, separating it from the mainland called Santa. On\r\nthe following Friday, being the 3rd of August, he discovered the point\r\nof Paria, which he also believed to be an island, giving it the name of\r\nGracia. But all was mainland, as in due time appeared, and still more\r\nclearly now is it known that here there is an immense continent.\r\n\r\nIt is well here to consider the injury and injustice which that Americo\r\nVespucio appears to have done to the Admiral, or that those have done\r\nwho published his _Four Navigations_, in attributing the discovery of\r\nthis continent to himself, without mentioning anyone but himself. Owing\r\nto this, all the foreigners who write of these Indies in Latin, or in\r\ntheir own mother-tongue, or who make charts or maps, call the continent\r\nAmerica, as having been first discovered by Americo.\r\n\r\nFor as Americo was a Latinist, and eloquent, he knew how to make use of\r\nthe first voyage he undertook, and to give the credit to himself, as\r\nif he had been the principal captain of it. He was only one of those\r\nwho were with the captain, Alonso de Hojeda, either as a mariner, or\r\nbecause, as a trader, he had contributed towards the expenses of the\r\nexpedition; but he secured notoriety by dedicating his _Navigations_\r\nto King Rene of Naples.[142] Certainly these _Navigations_ unjustly\r\nusurp from the Admiral the honour and privilege of having been the first\r\nwho, by his labours, industry, and the sweat of his brow, gave to Spain\r\nand to the world a knowledge of this continent, as well as of all the\r\nWestern Indies. Divine Providence reserved this honour and privilege\r\nfor the Admiral Don Cristobal Colon, and for no other. For this reason\r\nno one can presume to usurp the credit, nor to give it to himself or\r\nto another, without wrong, injustice, and injury committed against the\r\nAdmiral, and consequently without offence against God.\r\n\r\nIn order that this truth may be made manifest, I will here relate\r\ntruthfully, and impartially, the information on the subject which I\r\npossess. To understand the matter it is necessary to bear in mind that\r\nthe Admiral left San Lucar, on his third voyage, on the 30th of May 1498,\r\nand arrived at the Cape Verde Islands on the 27th of June. He sighted\r\nthe island of Trinidad on Tuesday, the 31st of July, and soon afterwards,\r\non Wednesday, the 1st of August, he saw the continent to the south of a\r\nstrait two leagues wide, between it and the island of Trinidad. He called\r\nthis strait the \"mouth of the Serpent\", and the mainland, believing it to\r\nbe an island, he named Isla Sancta. Presently, on the following Friday,\r\nhe sighted and discovered Paria, which he called Isla de Gracia, thinking\r\nthat it also was an island. An account of all these discoveries, with\r\na painted outline of the land, was sent by the Admiral to the Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThis being understood, we shall now see when Americo Vespucio set out, and\r\nwith whom, to discover and trade in those parts. Those who may read this\r\nhistory must know that, at that time, Alonso de Hojeda was in Castille,\r\nwhen the account of the discovery and of the form of that land arrived,\r\nwhich was sent by the Admiral to the Sovereigns. This report and map came\r\ninto the hands of the Bishop Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, afterwards\r\nBishop of Palencia, who had charge of all business connected with the\r\nIndies from the beginning, and was then Archdeacon of Seville. The said\r\nAlonso de Hojeda was a great favourite of the Bishop, and when the report\r\nof the Admiral and the map arrived, Fonseca suggested to Hojeda to go and\r\nmake more discoveries in the same direction as the Admiral had taken. For\r\nwhen the thread is discovered and placed in the hand, it is an easy\r\nmatter to reach the skein. Hojeda was aided by the information which the\r\nAdmiral had collected from the Indians when he served in the first voyage,\r\nthat there was a continent behind the lands and islands then reached. As\r\nhe had the favour and goodwill of the Bishop, he looked out for persons\r\nwho would fit out some ships, for he himself had not sufficient funds.\r\nAs he was known in Seville as a brave and distinguished man, he found,\r\neither there, or perhaps at the port of Santa Maria, whence he sailed,\r\nsome one who enabled him to fit out four ships. The Sovereigns gave\r\nhim his commission and instructions, and appointed him captain, for the\r\ndiscovery and purchase of gold and pearls, a fifth being reserved as the\r\nroyal share, and to treat of peace and friendship with people he should\r\nmeet with during the expedition.\r\n\r\nThus the first who went to discover after the Admiral was no other than\r\nAlonso de Hojeda. Those whom he took, and wanted to take in his company,\r\nconsisted of the sailors who were acquainted with the voyage to those\r\nlands, who were none others but those who had come and gone with the\r\nAdmiral. Those were the principal mariners of the time. One of them\r\nwas Juan de la Cosa Biscayan,[143] who went with the Admiral when he\r\ndiscovered this island, and was afterwards with him in the Cuba and\r\nJamaica discovery, the most laborious voyage up to that time. Hojeda also\r\ntook with him the pilot Bartolome Roldan, who was well known in this\r\ncity of San Domingo, and who built, from their foundations, a great\r\nnumber of the houses now standing in the four streets. He too had been\r\nwith the Admiral in his first voyage, and also in the discovery of Paria\r\nand the mainland. Hojeda also took the said Americo, and I do not know\r\nwhether as pilot, or as a man instructed in navigation and learned in\r\ncosmography. For it appears that Hojeda puts him among the pilots he\r\ntook with him.\r\n\r\nI gather from the prologue he addressed to King Rene of Naples, in the\r\nbook of his four _Navigations_, that the said Americo was a merchant,\r\nfor so he confesses. Probably he contributed some money towards the\r\nexpenses of fitting-out the four ships, with the condition of receiving\r\na proportionate share of the profits. Although Americo asserts that the\r\nKing of Castille sent out the expedition, and that they went to discover\r\nby his order, this is not true. Three or four, or ten, persons combined,\r\nwho were possessed of some money, and begged and even importuned the\r\nSovereigns for permission to go and discover and search, with the object\r\nof promoting their own profits and interests. Thus Hojeda, owing to his\r\nhaving got possession of the chart which the Admiral had sent home of\r\nthe mainland he had discovered, for the Sovereigns, and owing to his\r\nhaving with him the pilots and mariners who had been with the Admiral,\r\ncame to discover the further part of the mainland, which will be described\r\nin chapter 166.\r\n\r\nIt is a thing well known, and established by many witnesses, that Americo\r\nwent with Alonso de Hojeda, and that Hojeda went after the Admiral had\r\ndiscovered the mainland. It is also proved by Alonso de Hojeda himself.\r\nHe was produced as a witness in favour of the Crown, when the Admiral Don\r\nDiego Colon, next and legitimate successor of the Admiral Don Cristobal\r\nColon, had a lawsuit with the Crown for all the estate of which his father\r\nhad been dispossessed, as he was by the same cause. Alonso de Hojeda\r\ntestifies as follows, in his reply to the second question. He was asked \"if\r\nhe knew that the Admiral Don Cristobal Colon had not discovered any part of\r\nwhat is now called mainland, except when he once touched at the part called\r\nParia?\" The answer of Hojeda was that the Admiral touched at the island\r\nof Trinidad, and passed between that island and the \"Boca del Drago\",\r\nwhich is Paria, and that he sighted the island of Margarita. Being asked\r\nhow he knew this, he answered that he knew it because he, the witness,\r\nsaw the chart which the said Admiral sent to Castille, to the King and\r\nQueen our Lords, of what he had discovered at that time: and also because\r\nhe, the witness, soon afterwards went on his voyage of discovery,\r\nand found that the Admiral's account of what he had discovered was\r\nthe truth. To the fifth question, which refers to what the same Hojeda\r\ndiscovered himself beyond Paria, he replied as follows: \"I was the first\r\nto go on an exploring expedition after the discovery of the Admiral,\r\nand I went first nearly 200 leagues to the south on the mainland, and\r\nafterwards came to Paria, going out by the 'Boca del Drago'. There I\r\nascertained that the Admiral had been at the island of Trinidad, bordering\r\non the 'Boca del Drago'.\" Further on he says: \"In the voyage which this\r\nwitness undertook, he took with him Juan de la Cosa and Americo Vespucio,\r\nand other pilots.\"[144] Alonso de Hojeda says this, among other things,\r\nin his deposition and statement.\r\n\r\nTwo things are thus proved by Hojeda himself. One is that he took\r\nAmerico with him, and the other that he undertook his voyage to the\r\nmainland, after it had been discovered by the Admiral. The latter fact\r\nis established beyond any doubt, namely, that the Admiral was the first\r\nwho discovered Paria, and that he was there before any other Christian\r\nwhatever was either there or on any other part of the mainland, nor had\r\nany tidings of it. The Admiral Don Diego, his son, had proof of this\r\nfrom sixty hearsay witnesses and twenty-five eye-witnesses, as is seen\r\nby the records of the lawsuit, which I have not only seen but thoroughly\r\nexamined. It was also proved that it was owing to the Admiral having\r\nfirst discovered these islands of the Indies, and afterwards Paria,\r\nwhich is the mainland, before anyone else whatever, that the others had\r\nthe courage to follow his example and become discoverers. It may be\r\nheld for certain that no one would have undertaken to go on voyages of\r\ndiscovery, and that neither the Indies nor any part of them would have\r\nbeen made known if the Admiral had not led the way. This is proved by\r\nsixteen hearsay witnesses, by forty-one who believed it, by twenty who\r\nknew it, and by thirteen who gave evidence that in their belief the\r\nAdmiral made his discoveries before anyone else whatever. Peter Martyr\r\nalso gives the same testimony in his first Decade, chapters 8 and 9. This\r\nauthor deserves more credit than any of those who have written in Latin,\r\nbecause he was in Castille at the time, and knew all the explorers, and\r\nthey were glad to tell him all they had seen and discovered, as a man\r\nin authority; and because he made his inquiries with a view to writing,\r\nas we mentioned in the prologue of the history.\r\n\r\nAmerico confesses in his first _Navigation_ that he arrived at Paria\r\nduring his first voyage, saying: \"_Et provincia ipsa Parias[145] ab ipsis\r\nnuncupata est._\" Afterwards he made the second _Navigation_, also with\r\nHojeda, as will appear in chapter 162.\r\n\r\nHere it is important to note and make clear the error made by the world in\r\ngeneral respecting America. What I say is this: As no one had arrived at\r\nnor seen Paria before the Admiral, and as the next explorer who arrived\r\nwas Hojeda, it follows that either Americo was with Hojeda, or came after\r\nhim. If he was with Hojeda, Hojeda was after the Admiral. The Admiral\r\nleft San Lucar on the 30th of May, and came in sight of Trinidad and the\r\nmainland on the last day of July, and the 1st and 3rd of August, as has\r\nbeen proved. How, therefore, can Americo say, without a perversion of\r\nthe truth, that he left Cadiz in his first _Navigation_ on the 20th of\r\nMay of the year of our salvation 1497? The falsehood is clear, and if the\r\nstatement was made by him in earnest, he committed a great infamy. Even\r\nif it is not an intentional falsehood, it seems to be so; for he gives\r\nhimself an advantage of ten days as regards the Admiral, with reference\r\nto the departure from Cadiz, for the Admiral left San Lucar on the 30th\r\nof May, and Americo alleges that he departed from Cadiz on the 20th\r\nof that month, and also usurps a year, for the Admiral sailed in 1498,\r\nwhile Americo pretends that he set out on his first _Navigation_ in the\r\nyear 1497. It is true that there would seem to be a mistake, and not an\r\nintentional fraud in this, for Americo says that his first _Navigation_\r\noccupied eighteen months, and at the end he asserts that the date of\r\nhis return to Cadiz was the 15th of October 1499. If he left Cadiz on\r\nthe 20th of May 1497, the voyage occupied twenty-nine months: seven in\r\nthe year 1497, all the year 1498, and ten months in the year 1499. It\r\nis possible that 1499 may be a misprint for 1498[146] in treating of\r\nthe return to Castille, and if this was so, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe fraud was intentional. This fraud or mistake, whichever it may\r\nhave been, and the power of writing and narrating well and in a good\r\nstyle, as well as Americo's silence respecting the name of his captain,\r\nwhich was Hojeda, and his care to mention no one but himself, and his\r\ndedication to King Rene, these things have led foreign writers to name\r\nour mainland AMERICA, as if Americo alone, and not another with him, had\r\nmade the discovery before all others. It is manifest what injustice he\r\ndid if he intentionally usurped what belonged to another, namely, to the\r\nAdmiral Don Cristobal Colon, and with what good reason this discovery,\r\nand all its consequences, should belong to the Admiral, after the goodness\r\nand providence of God, which chose him for this work. As it belongs more\r\nto him, the said continent ought to be called Columba, after Colon, or\r\nColumbo, who discovered it, or else \"Sancta\" or \"De Gracia\", the names\r\nhe himself gave it, and not America after Americo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral sent five ships[147] with the news of the discovery of the\r\nmainland of Paria, and of the pearls. Alonso de Hojeda was then in\r\nSpain. I believe myself that he returned at the same time as my uncle,\r\nFrancisco de Penalosa, knowing that the Admiral had discovered that\r\nland and the pearls, and having seen the chart of the new discoveries\r\nwhich the Admiral had sent to the Sovereigns, and that the Admiral said\r\nin his letters that it was an island, although he was also inclined to\r\nthe belief that it was a continent; and being favoured by the Bishop of\r\nBadajos, Don Juan de Fonseca, who superintended and managed everything,\r\nHojeda petitioned that he might have licence to discover in those parts\r\neither continent, or islands, or whatever he might find. The Bishop\r\ngave the licence, signed with his own signature, and not with that of\r\nthe Sovereign, either because the Sovereigns ordered him to grant such\r\nlicences, or this one only, which is hard to believe; or because he\r\nwished to make the grant of his own authority, and without giving the\r\nSovereigns a share in the matter, the Admiral having complained to the\r\nSovereigns in the year 1495 that it was in opposition to his privileges\r\nto give a licence to anyone to undertake discoveries.... I do not see\r\nhow the Bishop was able to grant the licence in the way he did. But I\r\nquite see that as he was a very determined and obstinate man, and was\r\nhostile to the Admiral's interests, he may have taken this step actuated\r\nby his own audacity, and without consulting the Sovereigns. This is\r\npossible, but still I doubt it; for, although he was very intimate with\r\nthe Sovereigns, this was hardly a thing that he would have dared to do\r\non his own authority. The licence was granted with the limitations that\r\nit did not include the territory of the King of Portugal, nor the lands\r\ndiscovered by the Admiral up to the year 1495. Another question arises\r\nhere: Why was not the land excepted which the Admiral had just discovered,\r\nand which was identified by the letters and the chart he had sent to\r\nthe Sovereigns? To this I cannot give an answer.\r\n\r\nThat the licence was only signed by the said Bishop, and not by the\r\nSovereigns, there can be no doubt, for Francisco Roldan saw it, and so\r\ndescribed it to the Admiral, and I saw Roldan's original letter, as I\r\nwill presently mention.\r\n\r\nHojeda having obtained the licence, he found persons in Seville who would\r\nfit out four caravels or ships, for there were many who were eager to\r\ngo and discover by means of the thread which the Admiral had put into\r\ntheir hands. For he was the first who opened the gates of that Ocean Sea,\r\nwhich had been closed for so many ages.\r\n\r\nHojeda set out from the port of Santa Maria or of Cadiz in the month of\r\nMay. If Americo Vespucio does not speak contrary to the truth as regards\r\nthe day of the month, he does so as regards the year. The date of Hojeda's\r\ndeparture was the 20th of May 1499, not 1497, as Americo says, usurping\r\nthe honour and glory which belongs to the Admiral, and assuming the whole\r\nfor himself alone, wishing to give the world to understand that he was the\r\nfirst discoverer of the mainland of Paria, and not the Admiral, to whom\r\nis justly and rightfully due all the discovery of all these islands and\r\nmainland of the Indies, as has already been proved in chapter 140. In\r\nthat chapter I endeavoured to leave it doubtful whether Americo had,\r\nwith intention, tacitly denied that this discovery was made first by\r\nthe Admiral, and had given the credit of it to himself alone. For I had\r\nnot then seen what I afterwards gathered from those writings of Americo,\r\nand from other writings of those times in my possession, or which I have\r\nfound. From these I conclude that it was a most false and dishonest thing\r\non the part of Americo to wish to usurp against justice the honour due to\r\nthe Admiral. The proof of this falsehood is made clear from the evidence\r\nof Americo himself, in this way. We will assume what has already been\r\nproved in chapter 140, namely:--First, the testimony of such a multitude\r\nof witnesses who knew that the Admiral was the first who discovered\r\nthe mainland of Paria, and consequently no one reached any part of\r\nthe mainland before him, this being also affirmed by Peter Martyr in\r\nthe third and ninth chapters of his first Decade; and Hojeda himself,\r\nin his deposition, also testified, being unable to deny it, saying\r\nthat after he had seen the chart in Castille he went to discover, and\r\nfound that the Admiral had previously arrived at Paria and gone out\r\nby the Boca del Drago. Secondly, Americo went with Hojeda, either as\r\na pilot or as one who knew something of the sea, for he is mentioned\r\njointly with Juan de la Cosa and other pilots; or perhaps he went as\r\nan adventurer, contributing part of the expenses and having a share\r\nin the profits. Thirdly, we refer to what Americo confesses in his\r\nfirst _Navigation_, which is, that he reached a place called Paria by\r\nthe Indian natives; also, that in a certain part or province of the\r\ncoast of the mainland, or in an island where they made war, the Indians\r\nwounded twenty-two men and killed one. Now this happened in 1499, as I\r\nshall presently prove. What we say is this: The Admiral was the first\r\nwho discovered the mainland and Paria, Hojeda was the first after the\r\nAdmiral, and Americo, who went with Hojeda, confesses that they arrived\r\nat Paria. The Admiral left San Lucar on the 30th of May 1498; presently,\r\nHojeda and Americo left Cadiz in the following year, 1499. If the Admiral\r\nleft San Lucar on the 30th of May, and Hojeda and Americo sailed from\r\nCadiz on the 20th of May, and the Admiral departed first, it is clear\r\nthat the departure of Hojeda and Americo could not have been in that\r\nyear of 1498, but in the following year of 1499. Even if it can be said\r\nthat Hojeda and Americo may have departed first on the 20th of May of\r\nthe same year of 1498 that the Admiral sailed, still the statement of\r\nAmerico would be false, for he said that he departed in 1497. Now there\r\nis no doubt that Hojeda and Americo neither departed in 1497 nor in 1498,\r\nbut in 1499, and it is, therefore, demonstrated that it was not Americo\r\nwho first discovered the mainland of Paria, nor anyone else but the\r\nAdmiral. This is confirmed by what was shown in chapter 140, that Hojeda,\r\nin his deposition when he was called as a witness before the Fiscal, said\r\nthat after he had seen the chart of the land discovered by the Admiral,\r\nwhen he was in Castille, he went on a voyage of discovery himself,\r\nand found that the land was as it had been correctly laid down on the\r\nchart. Now the Admiral sent this chart with a report to the Sovereigns in\r\nthe year 1498; on the 18th of October the said ships left Navidad, and my\r\nfather was on board one of them. Afterwards Hojeda and Americo sailed on\r\nthe 20th of May, as Americo himself writes, and this can only have been in\r\nthe following year, 1499. This is confirmed by another reason. The Admiral\r\nwas informed by the Christians who were in the province of Yaquimo that\r\nHojeda had arrived at the land called Brasil on the 5th of September,\r\nand the Admiral wrote to this effect to the Sovereigns by the ships\r\nin which the Procurators of the Admiral and of Roldan went home. This\r\nwas in the year 1499, at the time when Francisco Roldan and his company\r\nwere about to be, or had been, induced to yield obedience to the Admiral.\r\nThis was the first voyage that Americo made with Hojeda. It is, therefore,\r\nclear that neither Hojeda nor Americo can have left Cadiz in 1497, but\r\nthey must have sailed in 1499. That this was the first voyage made by\r\nHojeda and Americo in search of the mainland appears from two reasons\r\nwhich have already been mentioned as being given by Americo himself in\r\nhis first _Navigation_. One is, that they arrived at a land called by\r\nthe natives Paria, and the other that the Indians wounded twenty-two men\r\nand killed one in a certain island. This latter fact was told to Francisco\r\nRoldan by Hojeda's people when the same Roldan went on board the ships\r\nof Hojeda. The Admiral sent him as soon as he was informed that Hojeda\r\nhad reached the land of Brasil.[148]\r\n\r\nFrancisco Roldan wrote to the Admiral from thence these, among other\r\nwords which I saw in the handwriting of Francisco Roldan, his handwriting\r\nbeing well known to me. The letter begins as follows:--\"I make known\r\nto your Lordship that I arrived where Hojeda was on Sunday the 29th of\r\nSeptember,\" etc., and he goes on: \"this being so, my Lord, I went on board\r\nthe caravels, and found in them Juan Velasquez and Juan Vizcaino,[149]\r\nwho showed me a concession made to him for the discovery of new countries,\r\nsigned by the Lord Bishop, by which he was granted permission to make\r\ndiscoveries in these parts so long as he did not touch the territory\r\nof the King of Portugal, nor the territory which had been discovered\r\nby your Lordship up to the year 1495. They made discoveries in the land\r\nwhich your Lordship recently discovered. He says that they sailed along\r\nthe coast for 600 leagues, where they encountered people who fought with\r\nthem, wounding twenty and killing one. In some places they landed and\r\nwere received with great honour, and in others the natives would not\r\nconsent to their landing.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the words of Francisco Roldan to the Admiral. Americo, in\r\nhis first _Navigation_, says:--\"But one of our people was killed and\r\ntwenty-two wounded, all recovering their health by the help of God.\"\r\nThe same Americo also relates that Hojeda and himself arrived at the\r\nisland Espanola, as will appear presently. It appears clearly from the\r\nevidence of the said Americo, and the agreement of his statement with\r\nwhat his companions told to Francisco Roldan, that they had twenty or\r\ntwenty-two wounded and one killed, and this was during his first voyage.\r\nIt also appears from both that they went to and saw Paria, and the coast\r\nnewly discovered by the Admiral. If this was the first voyage of Americo,\r\nand he came to this island in the year 1499, on the 5th of September,\r\nhaving left Cadiz on the 20th of May of the same year, 1499, as has been\r\ndistinctly shown, it follows that Americo has falsely stated that he left\r\nCadiz in the year 1497. This is also shown by what the Admiral wrote to\r\nthe Sovereigns when he knew that Hojeda had sailed five months before,\r\nin May. He wrote as follows:--\"Hojeda arrived at the port where the\r\nbrasil is, five days ago. These sailors say that as the time is so short\r\nsince his departure from Castille, he cannot have discovered land, but\r\nhe may well have got a lading of brasil before it could be prohibited,\r\nand as he has done, so may other interlopers.\" These are the words of\r\nthe Admiral, and I have seen them in his own handwriting. He intended\r\nto explain that little land could have been discovered in five months,\r\nand that, if he had not sent Francisco Roldan to prohibit the ships\r\nfrom taking a cargo of brasil, they might easily have done so and have\r\ndeparted, and that the same might be done by any other stranger, unless\r\nsteps were taken to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAll these proofs, taken from the letters of the Admiral and of Roldan,\r\ncannot be disputed, because they are most certainly authentic, and no\r\ndoubt can be thrown on any of them. For no one then could tell that this\r\nmatter would be alleged and brought forward, seeing that during fifty-six\r\nor fifty-seven years what was written told a different story, which was\r\nthe truth, nor was there anything to conceal.\r\n\r\nBut what Americo has written to make himself famous and give himself\r\ncredit, tacitly usurping the discovery of the continent which belongs\r\nto the Admiral, was done with intention. This is shown by many arguments\r\ngiven in this chapter and in chapter 140. But besides these verbal proofs,\r\nI desire to submit others which make the thing most manifest. One is that\r\nhe inverted the voyages he made, applying the first to the second, and\r\nmaking out that things which belonged to one happened in the other. He\r\nasserts that in the first voyage they were absent eighteen months,\r\nand this is not possible, for after being absent from Castille for\r\nfive months they came to this island, and they could not have returned\r\nagain to the mainland to coast along it for such a distance, owing to\r\ncontrary winds and currents, except with great difficulty and after\r\na long time. Thus his voyage to the continent only took five months,\r\nwithin which time he arrived here, as has been already explained, and\r\nas Hojeda told some of the Spaniards who were here, before he left this\r\nisland. He then made an inroad on some of the surrounding islands, seizing\r\nsome of the natives and carrying them off to Castille. According to the\r\nstatement of Americo, they took 222 slaves, and this occurs at the end of\r\nhis first _Navigation_. \"And we, following the way to Spain, at length\r\narrived at the port of Cadiz with 222 captured persons,\" etc. Another\r\nstatement is that certain injuries and violences done by Hojeda and his\r\nfollowers against the Indians and Spaniards in Xaragua in his first\r\nvoyage is placed by Americo at the end of his second _Navigation_. He\r\nthere says: \"We departed, and, for the sake of obtaining many things of\r\nwhich we were in need, we shaped a course for the island of Antiglia,\r\nbeing that which Christopher Columbus discovered a few years ago. Here\r\nwe took many supplies on board, and remained two months and seventeen\r\ndays. Here we endured many dangers and troubles from the same Christians\r\nwho were in this island with Columbus. I believe this was caused by envy,\r\nbut, to avoid prolixity, I will refrain from recounting what happened.\"\r\nThe Portuguese then called this island of Espanola Antilla, and this\r\nAmerico used the word Antiglia, because he was writing in Lisbon. In the\r\nfollowing chapter I will explain what these troubles from the Spaniards\r\nwere, and what caused them, which he excuses himself from dwelling upon\r\nin order to avoid prolixity. It will then be clearly seen that they\r\nhappened during his first voyage.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that they arrived at this island on the 5th of September,\r\nas he said, and that they remained, according to him, for two months\r\nand two days--that is, all September and October, and two more days of\r\nNovember. He there says that they left this island on the 22nd of July\r\nand arrived at the port of Cadiz on the 8th of September. All this is\r\nmost false. The same may be said of the dates of all the years, months,\r\nand days which Americo gives in his _Navigations_. It thus appears that\r\nhe designedly wished to take the glory and renown of the discovery of the\r\ncontinent, even keeping silence respecting the name of his own captain,\r\nAlonso de Hojeda, and tacitly usurping, as has been said, the honour and\r\nglory which belongs to the Admiral for this famous deed, deceiving the\r\nworld by writing in Latin, and to the King Rene of Naples, there being no\r\none to resist or expose his claim out of Spain, those who then knew the\r\ntruth being kept in ignorance. I am surprised that Don Hernando Colon,\r\nson of the same Admiral, and a person of good judgment and ability, and\r\nhaving in his possession these same _Navigations_ of Americo, as I know,\r\ndid not take notice of this injury and usurpation which Americo Vespucio\r\ndid to his most illustrious father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXV.\r\n\r\nThere remains the demonstrations, now proved in detail, of the industrious\r\ncontrivance of Americo Vespucio, not at first easily conceived, as I\r\nbelieve, but thought out at some subsequent time, by which he attributed\r\nto himself the discovery of the greater part of that Indian world, when God\r\nhad conceded that privilege to the Admiral. Now it is proper to continue\r\nthe history of what happened to Alonso de Hojeda, with whom Americo went\r\non his first voyage. He departed from the port of Cadiz with four ships,\r\nin the month of May. Juan de la Cosa, with all the experience acquired in\r\nhis voyages with the Admiral, went as pilot, and there were other pilots\r\nand persons who had served in the said voyages. Americo also embarked,\r\nas has already been mentioned in chap. 140, either as a merchant, or as\r\none versed in cosmography and studies relating to the sea. They sailed in\r\nMay, according to Americo, but not, as he says, in the year 1497, the true\r\ndate being 1499, as has already been sufficiently proved. Their course was\r\ndirected towards the west, to the Canary Islands, then southward. After\r\ntwenty-seven days[150] (according to the said Americo) they came in\r\nsight of land, which they believed to be continental, and they were not\r\ndeceived. Having come to the nearest land, they anchored at a distance\r\nof about a league from the shore, from fear of striking on some sunken\r\nrock. They got out the boats, put arms into them, and reached the beach,\r\nwhere they saw an immense number of naked people. They received them with\r\ngreat joy. But the Indians looked on with astonishment, and presently ran\r\naway to the nearest forest. The Christians approached them with signs\r\nof peace and friendship, but they would not trust the strangers. As the\r\nChristians had anchored in an open roadstead, and not in a port, wishing\r\nto be out of danger if bad weather came on, they weighed, and stood\r\nalong the coast to seek for a port, all the shore being crowded with\r\npeople. After two days they found a good port. (_Las Casas then quotes\r\nthe account of the natives given by Americo Vespucci, respecting which\r\nhe makes the following comments._) Americo relates all these things in\r\nhis first _Navigation_, many of which he could not have known in two,\r\nnor three, nor in ten days that he may have been among the Indians,\r\nnot knowing a single word of their language, as he himself confesses.\r\nSuch are the statements, that owing to the heat of the sun they move from\r\nplace to place every eight years; that when the women are enraged with\r\ntheir husbands they create abortions; that they have no rule or order\r\nin their marriages; that they have neither king nor lord nor chief in\r\ntheir wars; and others of the same kind. Therefore we can only believe\r\nthose statements which are based on what he actually saw or might see,\r\nsuch as what the natives ate and drank, that they went naked, that they\r\nwere of such and such colour, were great swimmers, and other external\r\nacts. The rest appears to be all fiction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVI.\r\n\r\nThey left these people and proceeded along the coast, often landing\r\nand having intercourse with different tribes, until they arrived at a\r\nport where, as they entered, they saw a town built over the water like\r\nVenice. Americo says that it contained twenty very large houses, built,\r\nlike the others he had seen, in the shape of a bell, and raised on very\r\nstrong piles. At the doors of the houses they had drawbridges, by which,\r\nas if they were streets, they went from one house to another. (_Las Casas\r\nthen gives the account of the encounter with the natives of this town on\r\npiles, just as it is given by Vespucci._) They made sail from this port,\r\nand proceeded for eighty leagues along the coast; and this was the land\r\nof Paria discovered by the Admiral, as has already been shown. Here they\r\nfound another people, with very different customs and language. They\r\nanchored and got into their boats to go on shore, where they found over\r\n4,000 natives on the beach. The Indians were so frightened that they\r\ndid not wait, but fled to the mountains. The Christians having landed,\r\nfollowed a path, and came to many huts, which they believed were those\r\nof fishermen. Here they found fish of various kinds, and also one of the\r\n_iguanas_ which I have already described, and which astonished them,\r\nfor they thought it was some very fierce serpent. The bread eaten by\r\nthese people, says Americo, was made with fish steeped in hot water,\r\nand afterwards pounded. From this mass small loaves were kneaded and\r\nbaked, making very good bread, in his judgment. They found many kinds\r\nof fruits and herbs; but they not only took nothing, but left many small\r\nthings from Castille in the huts, in the hope that thus the fears of the\r\nnatives would be dispelled, and the Spaniards then returned to the ships.\r\n(_Las Casas here inserts the account given by Vespucci of a journey\r\ninland, and of intercourse with these natives._) Americo then says that\r\nthe land was populous, and also full of many different animals, few being\r\nlike those of Spain. He mentions lions, bears, deer, pigs, wild goats,\r\nwhich had a certain deformity, and were unlike ours. But in truth I do\r\nnot believe that he saw either lions or bears, because lions are very\r\nrare, and there cannot have been so many as that he should see them;\r\nand the same remark applies to bears. No one who has been to the Indies\r\nhas even seen goats there, nor can I understand how he can have seen\r\nthe difference between deer and goats nor how he can have seen pigs,\r\nthere being none in those parts. Deer he may well have seen, as there\r\nare many on the mainland. He says there are no horses, mules, asses,\r\ncows, nor sheep, nor dogs, and here he tells the truth, although there\r\nis a kind of dog in some parts. He says that there is great abundance\r\nof other wild animals of various kinds, but if they were not rabbits he\r\ncould have little true evidence of having seen them. Of birds of different\r\nplumage and species he says that he saw many; and this I believe, for\r\nthere is an infinite number. He says that the region is pleasant and\r\nfertile, full of woods and great forests, which consist of evergreens,\r\nyielding fruits of many sorts; and all this is also true.\r\n\r\nHe then repeats that many people came to see the whiteness and persons\r\nof the Spaniards. (I do not know whether he is speaking of this same\r\nland, as it would seem, or of another, for he appears to confuse his\r\naccount here with what he had said before, that they had to depart that\r\nnight.) He tells us that the natives asked whence the Spaniards came,\r\nand they replied that they had come down from heaven to see the things of\r\nthe earth, which the Indians undoubtedly believed. Here the Christians\r\ncommitted a great sacrilege, thinking to make an agreeable offering to\r\nGod. As they saw the natives so gentle, meek, and tractable, although\r\nneither could understand a single word of what the other said, and\r\ntherefore the Spaniards could not teach the Indians any doctrine, yet,\r\nsays Americo, they baptized an infinite number; whence it appears how\r\nlittle Americo, and those who were with him, appreciated the practice\r\nof the sacraments and the reverence that is due to them, nor even the\r\ndisposition and frame of mind with which they should be received. It is\r\nmanifest that those Christians, in baptizing the natives, committed a\r\ngreat offence against God. Americo says that after they were baptized,\r\nthe Indians used the word _charaybi_, which means that they called the\r\nSpaniards men of great knowledge. This statement is a thing to laugh at,\r\nfor the Spaniards did not even know the Indian names for bread or for\r\nwater, which are among the first that we learn in acquiring a language;\r\nyet during the few days they remained Americo wants us to believe that he\r\nunderstood that _charaybi_ signifies men of great knowledge. Here Americo\r\ndeclares that the natives called this land _Paria_; and he conceals,\r\nwhat he must have known, that the Admiral had already been there several\r\ndays, which was a reason for not remaining silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVII.\r\n\r\nThey decided upon leaving this port and the sweetwater gulf formed by the\r\nisland of Trinidad and the mainland of Paria by the \"Boca del Drago\",\r\nand I suspect that, as this was a place which was notoriously discovered\r\nby the Admiral, Americo kept silence as to the name of \"Boca del Drago\"\r\nintentionally. For it is certain that Hojeda and Americo were within\r\nthis port, because the same Hojeda gave evidence to that effect on\r\noath, as well as many other witnesses also on oath, as is affirmed in\r\nthe evidence taken by the Fiscal. Here Americo says that the voyage\r\nhad now lasted thirteen months, but I do not believe it. Even if he\r\ntells the truth as regards the number of months, this must have been\r\nin the second voyage, which he afterwards made with the same Hojeda, as\r\nI think must be understood, and not in this first voyage, as is shown,\r\nfor many reasons already set forth, and for others which will hereafter\r\nbe given. Finally departing from Paria, they proceeded along the coast\r\nand arrived at Margarita, an island sighted by the Admiral and named by\r\nhim Margarita, although he did not stop there. Hojeda landed and walked\r\nover part of it, as he himself says, and those same witnesses who were\r\nwith them also say that he arrived there, though they neither deny nor\r\naffirm that he landed; but there need be no doubt of it, for it is a\r\npleasant island. This, however, little affects the question. It may be\r\nbelieved that they here bartered for pearls, although he does not say\r\nso, for other discoverers who came after him traded at the island of\r\nMargarita. Hojeda extended his journey to the province and gulf called\r\nCuquibacoa in the language of the Indians, which is now named Venezuela\r\nin our language, and thence to Cabo de la Vela, where they now fish for\r\npearls. He gave it that name of Cabo de la Vela, which it still retains;\r\nand a row of islands running east and west was discovered, some of which\r\nwere called the Islands of the Giants.\r\n\r\nThus had Hojeda coasted the mainland for 400 leagues, 200 to the east of\r\nParia, where he sighted the first land, and this was the only land that\r\nhe and those with him discovered. Paria and Margarita were discovered\r\nby the Admiral, as well as a great part of the said 200 leagues from\r\nMargarita to Cabo de la Vela, for the Admiral saw the chain of mountains\r\nto the westward as he sailed along, so that all this discovery is due\r\nto him. For it does not follow that, in order to be the discoverer of a\r\nland or island, a navigator must have passed along the whole of it. For\r\ninstance, it is clear that the island of Cuba was personally discovered\r\nby the Admiral, and for this it is not necessary that he should have gone\r\ninto every corner of it; and the same remark applies to Espanola and\r\nthe other islands, and also to the mainland, however large it may be,\r\nand however far it may extend, the Admiral discovered it. From this\r\nit appears that Americo exaggerated when he said that in his first\r\n_Navigation_ they sailed along the coast for 860 leagues. This is not\r\ntrue, as is proved by the confession of Hojeda, a man who had no desire\r\nto lose anything of his own glory and rights, for he said, as appeared\r\nin chapter 140, that he discovered 200 leagues beyond Paria, and the\r\ncoast from Paria to Cuquibacoa, which is now Venezuela. I have added as\r\nfar as Cabo de la Vela, because I found it so deposed in the process by\r\nseveral witnesses who afterwards knew all that land well, had intercourse\r\nwith the discoverers, and went with them in their voyages of discovery,\r\nthough not in that voyage of Hojeda; but the testimony was given when the\r\nevents were recent, and consequently well known. Hojeda himself did not\r\nmention Cabo de la Vela, because it is near the Gulf of Venezuela, and\r\nis all one land; and of the gulf and province he made principal mention,\r\nas a thing notable and important, and called by the natives Cuquibacoa.\r\n\r\nAlong all this land or sea-coast traversed by Hojeda, Americo, and\r\nhis company, they got gold and pearls by barter and exchange, but the\r\nquantity is not known, nor the deeds they perpetrated in the land.\r\nHaving left Margarita, they went to Cumana and Maracapana, which are\r\nrespectively seven and twenty leagues from Margarita. There are people\r\non the sea-shore, and before reaching Cumana there is a gulf where the\r\nwater of the sea forms a great angle extending fourteen leagues into the\r\nland, round which there are numerous and populous tribes. The first,\r\nnearly at the mouth of the bay, is Cumana. A large river falls into the\r\nsea near the village, in which there are numbers of the creatures we\r\ncall _lagartos_, but they are nothing more than the crocodiles of the\r\nriver Nile. As they were under the necessity of refitting the ships,\r\nthey being defective for so long a voyage as a return to Spain, and\r\nalso being in want of provisions, they arrived at a port which Americo\r\ncalls the best in the world. But he does not say where it was, nor does\r\nhe mention Hojeda. According to what I remember forty-three years after\r\nhaving been there, and over fifty years since the voyage of Hojeda, I\r\nsuspect that it must be a gulf called Cariaco, which runs fourteen leagues\r\ninto the land, the entrance being seven leagues from Margarita, on the\r\nmainland near Cumana. Further, it occurs to me that I heard that at\r\nthat time Hojeda entered and repaired his ships, and built a brigantine\r\nin the port called Maracapana, but this, though a port, is not the best\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nAt last they left the port, wherever it may have been, within those 200\r\nleagues of mainland from Paria onwards. They were received and served by\r\nthe people of that region, who were innumerable, according to Americo,\r\nas if they had been angels from heaven, and as Abraham had known the\r\nthree, so they were recognised as angels. They unloaded the ships and\r\nbrought them to land, always helped by the labour of the Indians. They\r\ncareened and cleared them, and built a new brigantine. They say that\r\nduring all the time that they were there, which was thirty-seven days,\r\nthey never had any need of touching their Castillian provisions, because\r\nthey were supplied with deer, fish, native bread, and other food; and\r\nif they had not been so provided, says Americo, they would have been in\r\ngreat distress for provisions in returning to Spain. During all the time\r\nthey were there they went on shore among the villages, in which they\r\nwere received with hospitality, honour, and festivity. This is certain\r\n(as will be seen further on in the course of the history, if it please the\r\nall-powerful God), that all these people of the Indies, being by nature\r\nmost simple and kind, know well how to serve and please those who come\r\nto them, when they look upon them as friends. When after having repaired\r\ntheir ships and built the brigantine they determined to return to Spain,\r\nAmerico here says that their hosts made great complaints of another cruel\r\nand ferocious tribe, inhabiting an island at a distance of 100 leagues;\r\nsaying that they came at a certain time of the year over the sea, to\r\nmake war, and that they carried off their captives, killing and eating\r\nthem. They showed their grief with so much feeling and persistency,\r\nsays Americo, that it moved us to compassion, and we offered to avenge\r\nthem. This made them rejoice greatly, says Americo, and they said they\r\nwould like to go also. But the Christians, for many reasons, would only\r\nconsent that seven natives should accompany them, on condition that they\r\nshould not be taken back to their country in the ships, but that they\r\nshould return in their own canoes, and to this, he says, both parties\r\nconsented. I do not know what interpreter made these agreements, nor who\r\nunderstood all that was said, but it is obvious that they could not have\r\nknown the language in thirty-seven days. And how could Hojeda and Americo,\r\nand those of their company, know whether the islanders had just cause\r\nfor war or not? Were these men so certain of the justice of the natives\r\nthat, without further delay, merely because they made complaints, they\r\noffered to avenge them? Pray God that they did not make this war to fill\r\nup their ships with natives, with a view to selling them for slaves, as\r\nthey afterwards did in Cadiz; work too often done by our people against\r\nthese unfortunate tribes and lands. They set out, and after seven days\r\nthey came upon numerous islands, some peopled and others uninhabited, says\r\nAmerico, at last arriving at their destination. These islands cannot be\r\nothers than those we reach in coming from Spain, such as Dominica and\r\nGuadalupe, and the others that lie in that line. Presently they saw,\r\nhe says, a great crowd of people, who, when they saw the ships and the\r\nboats approaching the shore well armed with guns, sent a body of 400 to\r\nthe water's edge, with many women, naked and armed with bows and arrows\r\nand shields, and all painted in different colours, and adorned with wings\r\nand feathers of large birds, so that they appeared very warlike and\r\nfierce. When the boats had approached to the distance of a cross-bow\r\nshot, they advanced into the water, and discharged a great number of\r\narrows to prevent their advance. The Christians discharged the firearms\r\nand killed many of them, and fearing the discharge and the firing, they\r\nleft the water and came on shore. A body of forty-two men then landed\r\nfrom the boats and attacked them. The natives did not fly, but stood their\r\nground manfully, and fought valiantly like lions, defending themselves and\r\ntheir country. They fought for two long hours, first with their guns and\r\ncross-bows, and afterwards with their swords and lances, killing many;\r\nand that they might not all perish, those of the natives who were able,\r\nfled into the woods. Thus the Christians remained victorious, and they\r\nreturned to their ships with great joy at having sent so many people to\r\nhell who had never offended them. On another day, in the morning, they\r\nsaw a great multitude of natives, making the air resound with horns and\r\ntrumpets, painted and armed for a second battle.\r\n\r\nThe Christians determined to send fifty-seven men against them, divided\r\ninto four companies, each with a captain, intending, says Americo, to make\r\nfriends with them if possible, but if not, to treat them as enemies, and\r\nto make slaves of as many as they could take. This is said by Americo,\r\nand it is to be noted here how he makes a pretext of truth and justice\r\nand legality, when the Spaniards had promised to go a hundred leagues on a\r\nmessage of war and vengeance. Yet they would come to treat of friendship\r\nwith the natives, seeking occasion to gratify their covetousness, which\r\nwas what they came for from Castille. Such are the pretexts and unworthy\r\nartifices that have always been used for the destruction of these natives.\r\n\r\nThey went on shore, but the Indians, owing to the fire from the guns,\r\ndid not venture to oppose their landing, yet they awaited them with great\r\nsteadiness. The naked men fought against the clothed men with great valour\r\nfor a long time, but the clothed made a fearful slaughter among the naked\r\nmen, the swords taking great effect on their naked bodies. The survivors\r\nfled when they saw that they were being cut to pieces. The Christians\r\npursued them to a village, capturing all they could, to the number of\r\ntwenty-five. They returned with their victory, but with the loss of one\r\nkilled and twenty-two wounded. They then sent away the seven natives who\r\nhad come with them from the mainland. They departed, says Americo, taking\r\nwith them as prisoners seven natives given to them by the Spaniards,\r\nthree men and four women, as their captives, and they were very joyful,\r\nadmiring that deed performed by the forces of the Christians. All this\r\nis related by Americo, who adds that they returned to Spain and arrived\r\nat Cadiz with 222 Indian captives, where they were, according to him,\r\nvery joyfully received, and where they sold all the slaves. Who will\r\nnow ask whence they stole and carried off the 200 natives? This, as\r\nother things, is passed over in silence by Americo. It should be noted\r\nhere by readers who know something of what belongs to right and natural\r\njustice, that although these natives are without faith, yet those with\r\nwhom Americo went had neither just cause nor right to make war on the\r\nnatives of those islands and to carry them off as slaves, without having\r\nreceived any injury from them, nor the slightest offence. Moreover, they\r\nwere ignorant whether the accusations of those of the mainland against\r\nthe islanders were just or unjust. What report, or what love would be\r\nspread about and sown among the natives, touching those Christians,\r\nwhen they left them wounded and desolate? But we must proceed, for,\r\ntouching this matter, _grandis restat nobis via_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVIII.\r\n\r\nHere Americo is convicted of a palpable falsehood, for he says that he\r\nwent to Castille from that island where he perpetrated such atrocities,\r\nmaking no mention of having first gone to Espanola, as he did. He refers\r\nthe visit to Espanola to his second voyage, but this is not true, as has\r\nalready been proved in chap. 162. It is not the fact that they went to\r\nCastille from the island where they made war and ill-treated the people:\r\nas can be proved from the witnesses examined before the Royal Fiscal, in\r\nthe lawsuit between Don Diego Colon and the King respecting the granting\r\nand observance of his privileges, of which I have often made mention\r\nbefore. They deposed that Alonso de Hojeda, with whom Americo sailed in\r\nhis first voyage, went along the coast to Cuquibacoa, which is Venezuela,\r\nand the Cabo de la Vela, and that thence they went to Espanola. Thus a\r\nwitness named Andres de Morales made oath, whom I knew well, a principal\r\npilot and a veteran of these Indies, citizen of Santo Domingo. He said\r\nin his deposition, in answer to the fifth question, as follows: \"that\r\nhe knew what happened during that voyage.\" Asked how he knew, he said:\r\n\"that he knew because he had often been with Juan de la Cosa and with\r\nAlonso de Hojeda, and talked over this voyage, and that they went from\r\nthe island of Roquemes in the Canaries, and arrived at the mainland near\r\nthe province of Paria, passing on to the island of Margarita, thence to\r\nMaracapana, discovering the coast as far as the Cacique Ayarayte, and\r\nthence, from port to port, to the Island of the Giants, the province of\r\nCuquibacoa, and the Cabo de la Vela, which name was given to it by the\r\nsaid Hojeda and Juan de la Cosa, and thence they went to the island of\r\nEspanola.\" These are his words. Now they could not go from a place so\r\nfar to leeward, to the island where they committed their depredations,\r\nbecause it must have been one of those towards the east, such as\r\nGuadalupe, and the islands near it. It would be very difficult to work\r\nto windward against wind and current, which are continuous. This is\r\nconfirmed by the fact that they reached Brazil in Espanola, which is\r\nthe port of Yaquimo,[151] and the proper and natural landfall from Cabo\r\nde la Vela. If they had repaired the ships and taken in provisions in\r\nthat port of the mainland, how was it that it was found necessary to\r\nrepair and take in provisions again at Espanola? How was it that the\r\nwitnesses, and especially the pilot, Andres de Morales, who seems to\r\nintimate that he went with them, do not mention that Hojeda had built a\r\nbrigantine and repaired his ships in some port of the mainland, that being\r\na remarkable event. It would strengthen the veracity of his statements\r\nwith reference to the discovery of that mainland having been made by him,\r\nwhich was the object of the suit presided over by the Fiscal against the\r\nAdmiral. It is clear that Americo transferred things which happened in\r\nthe first voyage to the second, while events of the second are referred\r\nto the first voyage, as we have demonstrated already in chap. 142, being\r\nsilent respecting many things, and adding others which never happened.\r\nFor example, the building of the brigantine and repairing of the ships\r\non the mainland certainly happened, and I know that it was so, being\r\nnotorious at that time; but it was during the second voyage, and not the\r\nfirst; while the coming to the island Espanola, where certain scandals\r\nwere caused by Hojeda, to which I shall presently refer, took place in\r\nthe first voyage, and not in the second, as Americo represents. I further\r\nsay that Hojeda never came to discover, trade, or settle on the mainland,\r\nwithout visiting Espanola. But his coming in the first voyage is denied\r\nor concealed by Americo by silence. From the time that Hojeda left Spain\r\nuntil he arrived at Espanola there was an interval of five months,\r\nwhich does not leave time for all that he is said to have done during\r\nthat first voyage.\r\n\r\nReturning to the first voyage of Hojeda, with whom Americo went by the\r\ncorrect route, and not by the interpolated and confused way alleged\r\nby Americo, we say that from the province of Cuquibacoa, now called\r\nVenezuela, and the Cabo de la Vela, he came to this island of Espanola,\r\nand anchored on the 5th of September, as I have already said in chap. 164,\r\nat Brazil, which is in the province of Yaquimo,[152] and I even believe\r\nfurther down, near that which is now called Cabana, the land and dominion\r\nof a king named Haniguayaba. The Spaniards, who were in that province\r\nof Yaquimo, presently knew of the arrival, either from the Indians,\r\nor because they saw the vessels come in from the sea. They knew that it\r\nwas Hojeda, and word was presently sent to the Admiral, who was at San\r\nDomingo, having recently made peace with Roldan and his companions. The\r\nAdmiral ordered two or three caravels to be got ready, and sent Roldan\r\nwith a force to prohibit the cutting of brasil wood, suspecting that\r\nHojeda would load with it. Roldan was also ordered to prevent the newcomer\r\nfrom doing any other mischief, as Hojeda was known to be most audacious\r\nin doing what he chose, it being a word and a deed with him, as they\r\nsay. Roldan arrived at the port of Yaquimo, or near it, with his caravels,\r\nand landed on the 29th of that month of September. He then learnt from\r\nthe Indians that Hojeda was close by. Roldan, with twenty-six of his men,\r\ncame within a league and a half, and sent five men by night, as spies,\r\nto see what force was with Hojeda. They found that he was coming to\r\nreconnoitre Roldan, for the Indians had told him that Roldan had arrived\r\nwith a large force in three caravels. Roldan was known and feared in all\r\nthat land, and the natives told Hojeda that Roldan had sent for him to\r\ncome where he was; but this was not the case. Hojeda only had fifteen men\r\nwith him, having left the rest in his four ships, which were in a port\r\nat a distance of eight leagues. He had come to get bread in the village\r\nof the cacique Haniguayaba, and they were making it, not venturing to\r\ndo anything else, fearing that Roldan would come to seize them. Hojeda,\r\nwith five or six men, came to where Roldan was, and entered into general\r\nconversation, Roldan inquiring how Hojeda had come to that island, and\r\nespecially to that part of it, without leave from the Admiral, and why\r\nhe had not first gone to where the Admiral was. Hojeda answered that he\r\nwas on a voyage of discovery, and that he was in great need of provisions\r\nand his ships of repairs, so that he had no other alternative, and that he\r\ncould not reach any nearer place. Roldan then asked him by what right he\r\nwas making discoveries, and whether he had a royal licence that he could\r\nshow to entitle him to get supplies without asking the permission of the\r\ngovernor. He answered that he had such a licence, but that it was on board\r\nhis ship, eight leagues distant. Roldan said that it must be shown to him,\r\notherwise he would be unable to give an account to the Admiral concerning\r\nthe business on which he had been sent. Hojeda complied as far as he was\r\nable, saying that when he was despatched from that port he would go to make\r\nhis reverence to the Admiral, and to tell him many things, some of which\r\nhe mentioned to Roldan. These were, I have no doubt, the questions then\r\nspoken of at Court, touching the deprivation of the Admiral, for, as Roldan\r\nwrote, they were things which were not fit to be discussed in letters.\r\n\r\nRoldan left Hojeda there and went with his caravels to the place where\r\nthe caravels of Hojeda were at anchor, and found some persons on board\r\nwho had been in Espanola with the Admiral, and had served with him in\r\nthe discovery of Paria, having returned in the five ships, especially\r\none Juan Velasquez and Juan Vizcaino,[153] who showed him the concession\r\nsigned by the Bishop Don Juan de Fonseca, which I have already mentioned\r\nin chap. 164. They informed him of the events of the voyage, and how\r\nmuch of the mainland they had discovered, and how they had lost one\r\nman killed, and twenty or more wounded, in a fight, as was stated in\r\nthe said chap. 164, in which it is proved that this happened during\r\nthe first voyage of Hojeda. Francisco Roldan also learnt from them that\r\nthey had found gold, and brought it in the form of _guaninas_, which are\r\ncertain trinkets, well and artificially worked, such as they know how\r\nto make in Castille, but the gold was below the standard. They brought\r\nantlers, and said they had seen deer, rabbits, and the skin of a tiger\r\ncat; also a collar made of the nails of animals, all which was news to\r\nthose who lived in Espanola. Roldan, knowing this, and believing that\r\nHojeda would do what he had promised; that is, that when he had got his\r\nsupply of bread in that village he would go to the port of San Domingo\r\nto visit the Admiral by land, ordered the caravels to do what they had\r\nto do, and I believe this was to get a cargo of brasil wood. Roldan went\r\nfrom Yaquimo to Xaragua, a distance of eighteen leagues, and visited\r\nthe Christians who were allotted to the villages of the Indians, doing\r\nwhat seemed best to him, and then returned to report the things that had\r\nbeen said to him by Hojeda to the Admiral, which could not have been the\r\nbest news in the world; for when the five ships came with intelligence\r\nof the rebellion of Roldan, they discussed at court the deposition of\r\nthe Admiral, a thing which Hojeda would not be the last to know, being\r\nfavoured by the Bishop Don Juan de Fonseca, and neither being friendly\r\nto the Admiral and his affairs. As regards the Bishop this was quite\r\nnotorious, and I saw it with my eyes, felt it with my feeling, and\r\nunderstood it with my understanding. As to Hojeda, it appeared afterwards\r\nthat he must have left Espanola, discontented with the Admiral.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXIX.\r\n\r\nRoldan took leave of Hojeda, believing that everything that glittered\r\nwas gold, and Hojeda, having got the bread about which he had arranged,\r\ninstead of taking the road to Santo Domingo to see the Admiral, and\r\ngive an account to him of what he had done during his voyage, as he had\r\npromised to Roldan, and to report the news from Castille, went with his\r\nfour ships towards the west, in the direction of the gulf and port of\r\nXaragua. The Christians who were living there, in the villages of the\r\nCaciques, received him with joy, and gave him and his people all they\r\nneeded, although not from the sweat of their own brows, but from that\r\nof the Indians, for of the latter the Spaniards are accustomed to be\r\nvery liberal. As one of their caravels was very unseaworthy, and could\r\nno longer be kept above water, they made the Indians work, and they\r\ngave much help until she was repaired, assisting in every other way\r\nthat was needed. While he was there he found that there were people who\r\nregretted the free life they had been so recently leading under Roldan,\r\nwho were ill-disposed towards the affairs of the Admiral, and who were\r\ndiscontented because they could not now do as they pleased. One of their\r\nmost common complaints was that their wages were not paid. Hojeda, moved\r\neither by the disposition he found in these people, or by the expectation\r\nof profit for himself, began to encourage the discontent, saying that\r\nhe would join with them, and, uniting them with his own people, that he\r\nwould go to the Admiral and demand payment in the name of the Sovereigns,\r\nand force him to pay, even if he did so unwillingly. He declared that\r\nhe had powers from the Sovereigns to do this, and that he and Alonso de\r\nCarvajal had received them, when the Admiral returned in the year 1498,\r\nthat they might come and constrain him to make the payments. He added\r\nmany other arguments, according to what they said, in great prejudice of\r\nthe Admiral, and to excite the people against him, to which the greater\r\npart inclined, being unprincipled men, friends of turbulence and unrest,\r\nand without fear either of God or of the mischief that would follow in\r\nthat island, both to Christians and Indians.\r\n\r\nThere were some, however, who did not wish to join in the foolish\r\nand evil deeds of Hojeda. These were in a certain farm or village near\r\nXaragua. For all were scattered among the Indian villages, to be fed and\r\nmaintained by the natives, which could not be done if they all remained\r\ntogether. As these men refused their approval when they were incited,\r\neither by letters or by word of mouth, or because they had among them some\r\none who was obnoxious to Hojeda in times past, he arranged one night, in\r\nconcert with those who had joined him, to attack the loyal men and wreak\r\nhis vengeance on them, or do them some other injury; and this was done,\r\nwith the result that several men were killed and wounded on both sides.\r\n\r\nThis caused great scandal in the land, among Indians as well as\r\nChristians, so that disturbances even worse than those of Roldan,\r\nrecently appeased, would have arisen if God, using the same Roldan as\r\nHis instrument, had not obviated the danger. Roldan now returned from\r\nSanto Domingo to Xaragua. Either because the Admiral suspected that Hojeda\r\nwould return and cause injury, both to Christians and Indians, and wished\r\nto be certain that he had left the island; or because he had received\r\nintelligence from the Christians who remained loyal of what was taking\r\nplace, for they sent messages by Indians every eight days, he finally\r\ndespatched Roldan to Xaragua, who heard on the road of the scandals and\r\nmischief done by Hojeda, and of the object he announced. Roldan then\r\nsent to one Diego de Escobar, a leading man among those who had always\r\nfollowed him, ordering him to collect as large a force as possible from\r\namong those who had not been influenced by Hojeda, and to come with them\r\nto Xaragua. He collected all he could from the villages in which the\r\nChristians were scattered, and both arrived at Xaragua on two successive\r\ndays. Hojeda had by that time returned to his ships.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Roldan wrote a letter to Hojeda, pointing out the scandals,\r\ndeaths, and mischief he had caused, the disservice that the Sovereigns\r\nwould receive from such conduct, the disturbance caused in the colony, the\r\ngood will which the Admiral entertained towards him, and urging him not\r\nto adopt a course which would cause loss to all. In order that the evils\r\nmight be forgotten, as what was done could not be helped, he proposed\r\nthat Hojeda should at least come and excuse himself. Hojeda would not\r\nplace himself in such peril, for he knew Roldan to be an astute and\r\nresolute man, and with no small intelligence. Roldan then sent Diego de\r\nEscobar to confer with Hojeda, who was not less able than the other two.\r\nI knew him well during many years. Escobar set before Hojeda the heinous\r\ncharacter of what he had done as strongly as he could, and urged him to\r\ncome to Roldan. Hojeda replied that it was what he wished to do. Escobar\r\nreturned without having been able to make a definite arrangement. But\r\nRoldan, believing that Hojeda would agree, sent one Diego de Truxillo,\r\nwho, as soon as he came on board the ship, was seized and put in irons.\r\nHojeda then landed and marched to Xaragua with twenty armed men. He found\r\nthere one Toribio de Linares, whom I also knew well. He was seized and\r\ntaken to the ships, where he was put in irons. These proceedings were\r\nreported by the Indians to Roldan, who was then at a distance of a league\r\nfrom Xaragua. Roldan quickly set out in pursuit with the men he had with\r\nhim, well equipped, but Hojeda was already out of his reach. He then\r\nsent one Hernando de Estepa, whom I also knew well, to whom Hojeda said\r\nthat unless one Juan Pintor, who had left the ship, was given up (a man\r\nwhom I also knew, and who only had one hand), he swore he would hang the\r\ntwo prisoners he had in irons. What harm had these done to merit hanging,\r\nbecause Juan Pintor had deserted! Hojeda got under weigh with his ships,\r\nand proceeded along the coast to some villages and a province called Cahay,\r\nwhere there is a charming country and people, ten or twelve leagues from\r\nXaragua. Here he landed with forty men, and seized all the provisions he\r\nwanted by force, especially yams and sweet potatoes, for here are the\r\nbest and finest in the island, leaving both Christians and Indians in\r\ngreat want. Seeing that he had made sail, Roldan sent Diego de Escobar\r\nalong the sea-shore in pursuit with twenty-five men. But as they arrived\r\nat night, Hojeda had already returned to his ships. Soon afterwards,\r\nRoldan followed in pursuit with twenty men, and, having arrived at Cahay,\r\nhe found there a letter which Hojeda had written to Diego de Escobar,\r\ndeclaring that he would hang his two prisoners if his man, Juan Pintor,\r\nwas not restored. Roldan then ordered Diego de Escobar to get into a\r\ncanoe, manned, as the sailors say, by Indian rowers, and to go within\r\nhail of the ships. He was to tell Hojeda, on the part of Roldan, that\r\nas he would not trust him and come to speak with him, he was willing to\r\ncome to the ships, trusting in his honour, and asking that he would send\r\na boat with this object. Hojeda perceived that his game was now made;\r\nbut another thought occurred to him, which was that Francisco Roldan\r\nhad brought his drums on his back, as the saying is. Hojeda sent a very\r\ngood boat, for he had only one such, with eight very valiant seamen,\r\nwith their lances, swords, and shields. Coming within a stone's-throw\r\nof the beach, they called out that Roldan should embark. Roldan asked,\r\n\"How many did the captain say were to come with me.\" They answered, \"Five\r\nor six men.\" Roldan presently ordered that Diego de Escobar should get\r\nin first, then Pero Bello, Montoya, and Hernan Brabo, and Bolanos. They\r\nwould not consent that any more should get into the boat. Then Roldan\r\nsaid to one Pedro de Illanes that he must take him to the boat on his\r\nback, and as he wanted some one else at his side, he took another man\r\nnamed Salvador. Having all got into the boat, Roldan dissimulated,\r\nsaying to those who were rowing that they should row towards the\r\nland. They did not wish to do so. He and his men put their hands to\r\ntheir swords, and laid about them with such effect that some were\r\nkilled, others jumped overboard, and all were made prisoners, as well\r\nas an Indian archer kidnapped from the islands, only one escaping by\r\nswimming. They were brought on shore, and thus Hojeda was left without\r\nhis best boat, of which he had much need, and also without quite so\r\nmuch pride and insolence. Hojeda, seeing that his artifice had failed,\r\nand his intentions were frustrated, resolved to resume the negotiation\r\nwith more humility. So he got into a small boat with Juan de la Cosa,\r\nhis principal pilot, a gunner, and four more, and pulled towards the\r\nshore. Francisco Roldan, knowing him to be reckless and valiant, and\r\neven thinking that he might venture to attack, got ready the large boat\r\nwith seven rowers and fifteen fighting men, and a good canoe capable\r\nof holding fifteen more, all \"_a pique_\", as the sailors say. Being\r\non the water, as soon as they were within hailing distance, Hojeda said\r\nthat he wished to speak with Francisco Roldan. Coming nearer, Francisco\r\nRoldan asked him why he had perpetrated those scandalous and culpable\r\nacts. He replied that it was because they told him that the Admiral had\r\ngiven orders to apprehend him. Roldan assured him that it was false,\r\nand that the Admiral had no intention of doing him harm, but rather to\r\nhelp him and do him honour, and that if he would come to Santo Domingo\r\nhe would find this to be true by his own experience. Finally Hojeda\r\nasked that his boat and men might be restored, no longer caring about\r\nJuan Pintor, representing that he could not return to Spain without his\r\nboat. Francisco Roldan saw the difficulty in which Hojeda was placed--for\r\nthere had been a terrible gale just before, and Hojeda's largest ship\r\nhad dragged her anchors, and had been driven more than two cross-bow\r\nshots nearer the shore, where there was danger of ship and crew being\r\nlost; also because if Hojeda remained on the island there would be\r\ngreater confusion caused by him than had previously been caused by\r\nRoldan himself. For these reasons Roldan decided to restore the boat\r\nwith the men, if Hojeda would restore the two prisoners he had seized\r\nand ill-treated. This was arranged. He departed to make an incursion,\r\nwhich he said he had to make, and according to what a clergyman who was\r\nwith him said, and two or three other honest men who were left, the raid\r\nthat he sought to make was what he intended to do against the person\r\nand affairs of the Admiral, and I firmly believe that he had means of\r\nknowing that the Sovereigns were considering the removal of the Admiral\r\nfrom his place. For Hojeda was in favour with the Bishop Fonseca, and,\r\non the other hand, the same Bishop always viewed the Admiral with\r\ndisfavour, justly or unjustly, as to men I say, \"God knows.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to what I suspect, when Hojeda left Espanola he went to load\r\nhis ships with Indians, either in some part of that island, or in the\r\nIsland of San Juan,[154] or in some of the neighbouring islands, for\r\nhe brought to Spain and sold at Cadiz 222 slaves, as Americo confessed\r\nin his first _Navigation_. This, with the other injuries and outrages\r\nperpetrated on Christians and Indians by Hojeda, was his cargo. From what\r\nhas been seen in this chapter, the falsehoods of Americo are apparent,\r\nand the tyrannies committed in this his first voyage, when he accompanied\r\nHojeda, as well as the way in which he confused the events of the two\r\nvoyages, are now made as evident as that the sun shines. Americo says,\r\nrespecting the scandals of Hojeda which took place during the first\r\nvoyage, but which he places in the second, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We departed, and, for the sake of obtaining many things of which we\r\nwere in need, we shaped a course for the island of Antiglia, being that\r\nwhich Christopher Columbus discovered a few years ago. Here we took many\r\nsupplies on board, and remained two months and 17 days. Here we endured\r\nmany dangers and troubles from the same Christians who were in this\r\nisland with Columbus. I believe this was caused by envy; but to avoid\r\nprolixity I will refrain from recounting what happened. We departed from\r\nthe said island on the 22nd of July.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is false. He says that he does not describe the troubles they\r\nsuffered, to avoid prolixity, giving to understand that they suffered\r\nunjustly; and he does not tell the cause, or what were the outrages that\r\nthey committed. Moreover, to place these scandals in the second voyage\r\nis also false, as has already been sufficiently shown. To state that the\r\ndate of departure was the 22nd of July is still more false. For that\r\ndate was almost at the end of February in the year 1500, and I even\r\nbelieve in March, as appears from the letters which I saw and had in my\r\npossession. I know the handwriting of Francisco Roldan, who wrote every\r\neight or fifteen days to the Admiral, when he went to watch Hojeda. The\r\nfact is that the date which should belong to the second he put in the\r\nfirst voyage; and the outrages and harm those who were with him did in\r\nthe first, he referred to as injuries done to them, without provocation,\r\nin the second voyage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF WITNESSES (IN THE LAWSUIT) RESPECTING THE VOYAGE OF PINZON\r\nAND SOLIS.[155]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antonio Garcia_, a pilot, saw the drawing of what had been discovered\r\nby Juan Diaz, and it is all one coast.[155]\r\n\r\n_Vicente Yanez Pinson_ deposed that this witness and Juan de Solis\r\nwent by order of their Highnesses, and discovered all the land that\r\nup to this time has been discovered from the island of Guanaja to the\r\nprovince of Camarona, following the coast _towards the east_ as far as\r\nthe provinces of Chabaca and Pintigron, which were discovered by this\r\nwitness and Juan de Solis, who likewise discovered, in following along\r\nthe coast, a great bay to which they gave the name of the Bay of the\r\nNativity. Thence this witness discovered the mountains of _Caria_,[156]\r\nand other land further on.[157]\r\n\r\n_Rodrigo de Bastidas_ said that Yanez and Juan Diaz de Solis went to\r\ndiscover below Veragua. He did not know how much they discovered, but\r\nit is all one coast with that which was first discovered by the Admiral.\r\n\r\n_Nicolas Perez_ said that the Admiral, in that voyage when he went to\r\nVeragua, discovered Cape Gracias a Dios, and that all beyond that is\r\ndiscovered, was discovered by Yanez and Juan Diaz de Solis; that this\r\nappears by the sea-chart drawn by them, and that by it all who go to\r\nthose parts are guided.\r\n\r\n_Pedro de Ledesma_,[158] pilot, said that he went in company of Vicente\r\nYanez and Juan Solis by order of their Highnesses, and saw what Vicente\r\nYanez and Juan de Solis discovered beyond the land of Veragua, in a\r\npart towards the north,[159] all that which has been made known up to\r\nthe present time, from the island of Guanaja towards the north; and that\r\nthese lands are called Chabaca and Pintigron, and that they reached in\r\na northerly direction as far as 23-1/2 degrees, and that in this part\r\nthe said Don Cristobal Colon neither went, nor discovered, nor saw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAS CASAS ON THE VOYAGE OF PINZON AND SOLIS.[160]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Admiral left the solitude and the hardships he suffered in\r\nJamaica and came to Castille, it being known what he had discovered, there\r\npresently agreed together one Juan Diaz de Solis and Vicente Yanez Pinzon\r\n(brother of Martin A. Pinzon, of whom we said that he helped the Admiral\r\nto fit out in the town of Palos, and went with him, taking Vicente Yanez\r\nand another brother, when he sailed on the first voyage to discover\r\nthese Indies, as has been explained in the first book) to set out and\r\ndiscover, and to continue the route which the Admiral had left on his\r\nfourth and last voyage of discovery. These went to take up the thread\r\nfrom the island or islands of Guanajes, which we said that the Admiral\r\nhad discovered in his last voyage, and they turned to the east.[161]\r\n\r\nThese two discoverers sailed[162] (as may be gathered from the statement\r\nof witnesses called by the Fiscal in the lawsuit with the second Admiral)\r\ntowards the west from the Guanajes, and must have arrived near the Golfo\r\nDolce, although they did not see it because it is concealed, but they saw\r\nthe openings made by the sea into the land, which contains the Golfo Dolce\r\nand that of Yucatan, and it is like a great gulf or bay. (The mariners\r\ngive the name of bay to the sea that is between two lands in the form of\r\nan open port, which would be a port if it was not that it is very large,\r\nbut being very capacious and not closed, they call it a bay, the _i_\r\nand _a_ in _bahia_ being pronounced separately.) Thus, as they saw\r\nthat great angle made by the sea between the two lands, the one which\r\nis on the left hand having its back to the east, and this is the coast\r\nwhich contains the port of Caballos and in front of it the Golfo Dolce,\r\nand the other on the right hand, which is the coast of the province\r\nof Yucatan. It appeared to them to be a great bay, and Vicente Yanez,\r\ntherefore (in the sworn deposition he made in the said lawsuit, when he\r\nwas called a witness by the Fiscal), said that, sailing from the island\r\nof Guanajes, the coast stretching along, they discovered a great bay to\r\nwhich they gave the name of the \"Great Bay of the Nativity\", and thence\r\nthey discovered the hills of Caria,[163] and other lands further on.\r\nAccording to the other witnesses, they then turned north.[164] From all\r\nthis it appears certain that they then discovered a great part of the\r\nkingdom of Yucatan, but as afterwards there was no one who would continue\r\nthat discovery, nothing more was known of the edifices of that kingdom,\r\nwhence the territory and grandeur of the kingdoms of New Spain might\r\neasily have been discovered. But they were found by chance from the island\r\nof Cuba, as, please God, will be set forth in Book III of this history.\r\n\r\nAnd it must here be remarked that these discoverers were chiefly actuated\r\nin their enterprize by emulation of the Admiral, and of what he had\r\ndiscovered before, in the service of the Sovereigns. As if the Admiral\r\nhad not been the first to open the gates of the ocean which had been\r\nclosed for so many thousands of ages before, and had not shown the light\r\nby which all might see how to discover. The Royal Fiscal devoted all\r\nhis studies to prove that the parts of the mainland discovered by\r\nthe other explorers were distinct from those which the Admiral had\r\ndiscovered, and he would make a point that the mainland was not so\r\nlong; his object being to diminish the Admiral's credit, and to make\r\nout that the Sovereigns were less obliged to recognise the inestimable\r\nservices he had performed, and to fulfil the promises they had made,\r\nand by which they were bound so justly and with such good reason. This\r\nwas a great injustice.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this design, the Fiscal put the question whether\r\nthe witnesses knew that the discoveries made by others were distinct\r\nfrom those made by the Admiral. For the most part he got the answers\r\nhe wanted from the sailors, who said it was a different land. But they\r\nwere not asked if it was all one mainland, nor did they deny that. But\r\nothers, especially two honourable men whom I knew well, the one Rodrigo\r\nde Bastidas, of whom we have already treated, the other a pilot named\r\nAndres de Morales, understanding the injury that the prosecutor was\r\ntrying to do the Admiral, deposed many times, on different occasions\r\nin the course of the lawsuit, that the lands others had discovered were\r\nto the west of those discovered by the Admiral, but that the whole was\r\none continuous land. True that Vicente Yanez and Juan de Solis went to\r\ndiscover beyond Veragua, along that coast, but all the land that they or\r\nany others discovered of the region called the main was all one coast,\r\nand continuous with what the Admiral discovered first. Others, besides\r\nthese two, say it is all one coast from Paria, though provinces have\r\ndifferent names, and there are also different languages. This was then\r\ndeclared by witnesses who had been there, and knew it well by having\r\nused their own eyes, and now it would be needless to seek further for\r\nwitnesses than in the grocers' shops in Seville. Thus it cannot be denied\r\nto the Admiral, except with great injustice, that as he was the first\r\ndiscoverer of those Indies, so he was also of the whole of our mainland,\r\nand to him is due the credit, by discovering the province of Paria,\r\nwhich is a part of all that land. For it was he that put the thread into\r\nthe hands of the rest, by which they found the clew to more distant\r\nparts. Consequently, his rights ought most justly to be complied with\r\nand respected throughout all that land, even if the region was still\r\nmore extensive, just as they should be respected in Espanola and the\r\nother islands. For it was not necessary for him to go to every part,\r\nany more than it is necessary in taking possession of an estate, as the\r\njurists hold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *

He refers to the evidence of one\r\nCristobal Garcia of Palos, given on October 1st, 1515, to the effect\r\nthat, he being at San Domingo, Hojeda and La Cosa arrived there in a\r\nsmall bark, having lost their ships, and with only fifteen or twenty\r\nmen, the rest being dead (_Nav._, iii, 544). But this cannot refer to\r\nthe voyage of 1499, when Hojeda had not lost his ships, and did not go\r\nto San Domingo. The evidence, of course, relates to his disastrous\r\nsecond voyage. The narrative of Roldan, quoted by Las Casas, proves that\r\nHojeda came to Espanola with all his ships, that Vespucci was not left\r\nbehind on the coast of the mainland, and that the dates given by Vespucci\r\nare false, either through carelessness or design.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Nav._, iii, 544.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Vespucci.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Casas and Herrera.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: In one of the forged letters published by Bandini.

(Varnhagen, _Nouvelles\r\nRecherches_, p. 12.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Juan de la Cosa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Vianelo was misinformed as to Vespucci having accompanied\r\nJuan de la Cosa on this voyage in 1506. There are documentary proofs\r\nthat Vespucci was in Spain during the whole of that year. There was an\r\nintention of sending him, with Vicente Pinzon, in search of the Spice\r\nIslands by the west, and he was consulted on the subject in August 1506,\r\nbut the intention was abandoned. The account given by Vianelo of the\r\nvoyage (especially the stories about the dragons and the gold) may have\r\nbeen furnished by Vespucci. It is quite in his manner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Sp., a sort of whale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Vernicare_, \"to varnish\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _Assassimo_ (?).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Nav._, iii, 292, from the Archives of Simancas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: It has been pretended that John Cabot had sighted the\r\ncontinent in the previous year, but this is not so. He only sighted Cape\r\nBreton and other islands. In his second voyage he sighted the continent\r\n(1498), but the month is unknown.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Las Casas only knew the Latin version.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Juan de la Cosa was called \"Vizcaino\" (Biscayan) by his\r\ncontemporaries; but he was a native of Santona, in the province of\r\nSantander, a place which was not then, and never had been, in Biscay, or\r\nin the Basque country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: The words \"other pilots\" are to be coupled with Juan de\r\nla Cosa, certainly not with Vespucci, who then went to sea for the first\r\ntime, in advanced middle age, and could in no sense be called a pilot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: So in the Latin edition. In the Italian version _L_ is\r\nsubstituted for _P_, and _b_ for _s_, making _Lariab_. This may be a\r\nmisprint, but in the absence of the manuscript it is not possible to be\r\nsure whether the original word was _Parias_, or _Lariab_, or something\r\nelse. Las Casas bases part of his argument on the use of the word\r\n_Paria_ by Vespucci; but the case against the Florentine's alleged first\r\nvoyage is quite conclusive, without this fact. If Vespucci did use the\r\nword _Lariab_, it must have been invented by him, like _Iti_. It is in\r\nfavour of _Lariab_ that the Italian version only passed from manuscript\r\nto print, while the Latin version was translated first into French, and\r\nthence into Latin, before it was printed. On the other hand, there is\r\nevidence that the editors of the Latin version were unacquainted with\r\nthe details of the third voyage of Columbus, in which the word _Paria_\r\nfirst occurs. It, therefore, is not possible that the word can have been\r\ninserted mistakenly by them. It seems, therefore, that _Lariab_ is a\r\nmisprint of the Italian compositors, and that _Parias_ was the word in\r\nthe manuscript of Vespucci.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: This is so. The departure, in the Latin version, is on\r\nMay 20th, 1497; in the Italian it is May 10th, 1497. The date of the\r\nreturn is 1499 in the Latin, and 1498 in the Italian edition.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Columbus arrived at Santo Domingo, on his third voyage,\r\nafter discovering Trinidad and the mainland of America, on August 31st,\r\n1498. He found Francisco de Roldan in open rebellion against his brother,\r\nthe Adelantado. On October 18th, 1498, he sent five ships to Spain with\r\na cargo of dyewood, and 600 slaves. By these ships the Admiral despatched\r\nhis chart of the new discoveries, with a report, and two long letters\r\ngiving an account of the rebellion of Roldan and the state of the colony.\r\nLas Casas believes that letters full of complaints of the Admiral were\r\nalso sent home by Roldan and his accomplices. The father of Las Casas,\r\nwho had gone out with Columbus in 1493, returned to Spain by this\r\nopportunity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Port of Jacmel in Espanola.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Juan de la Cosa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Latin version. The Italian version has thirty-seven days.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Jacmel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Jacmel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Juan de la Cosa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Puerto Rico.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _Nav._, iii, p. 558.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _Paria._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Navarrete_, iii, 558. Peter Martyr (Dec. I, Lib. x) says\r\nthat Yanez turned his course to his left hand, by the east, to Paria,\r\nand among the princes who came to him were Chiauaccha and Pintguanus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Pedro de Ledesma (being 37 in March 1513, _Nav._, iii,\r\n539) was born at Seville in 1476. Gregorio Camacho heard him say that\r\nhe accompanied Columbus in his first voyage (_Nav._, iii, 588) when he\r\nwould have been aged 16. He was with Columbus in the fourth voyage,\r\nserving as a seaman in the _Vizcaina_, under Bartolome Fieschi,\r\n1503-1504, aged 27. He very gallantly swam on shore over a bar to get\r\ntidings at Veragua, but joined the mutineers at Jamaica, and was very\r\nseverely wounded. In his evidence he said he was Captain and Pilot,\r\nwhich is false. He was pilot with Pinzon and Solis in 1510, and pilot\r\n1511-14. He sailed with Solis to Rio de la Plata, and was drowned on the\r\nvoyage home in 1516. Las Casas says he was stabbed to death in a street\r\nin Seville (iii, 180).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: A mistake for east.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Lib. 11, chap. xxxix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: See also _Peter Martyr_, Dec.
