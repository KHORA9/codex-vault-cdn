  "content": "THE LAND-WAR IN IRELAND\r\n\r\nA HISTORY FOR THE TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JAMES GODKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF 'IRELAND AND HER CHURCHES'\r\nLATE IRISH CORRESPONDENT OF 'THE TIMES'\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON MACMILLAN AND CO. 1870\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY SPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE AND\r\nPARLIAMENT STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to name any subject so much discussed during the\r\nlast half century as 'the condition of Ireland.' There was an endless\r\ndiversity of opinion; but in one thing all writers and speakers\r\nagreed: the condition was morbid. Ireland was always sick, always\r\nunder medical treatment, always subject to enquiries as to the nature\r\nof her maladies, and the remedies likely to effect a cure. The royal\r\ncommissions and parliamentary committees that sat upon her case were\r\ninnumerable, and their reports would fill a library. Still the nature\r\nof the disease, or the complication of diseases, was a mystery. Sundry\r\n'boons' were prescribed, by way of experiment; but, though recommended\r\nas perfect cures, they did the patient no good. She was either very\r\nlow and weak, or so dangerously strong and violent that she had to be\r\nput under restraint. Whenever this crisis arrived, she arrested the\r\nspecial attention of the state doctors. Consultations were held, and\r\nit was solemnly determined that something should be done. Another\r\neffort should be made to discover the _fons malorum_, and dry it up if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nA diseased nation, subject to paroxysms of insanity, and requiring\r\n30,000 keepers, was a dangerous neighbour, as well as a serious\r\nfinancial burden. Yet many contended that all such attempts were\r\nuseless. It was like trying different kinds of soap to whiten the skin\r\nof a negro. The patient was incurable. Her ailment was nothing but\r\nnatural perversity, aggravated by religious delusions; and the root\r\nof her disorder could never be known till she was subjected to a _post\r\nmortem_ examination, for which it was hoped emigration, and the help\r\nof improving landlords, would soon afford an opportunity. In the\r\nmeantime, the strait waistcoat must be put on, to keep the patient\r\nfrom doing mischief.\r\n\r\nBut at length a great physician arose, who declared that this state of\r\nthings should not continue; the honour, if not the safety, of\r\nEngland demanded that the treatment should be reversed. Mr. Gladstone\r\nunderstands the case of Ireland, and he has courage to apply the\r\nproper remedies. Yet the British public do not understand it so well;\r\nand he will need all the force of public opinion to sustain him and\r\nhis cabinet in the work of national regeneration which they have\r\nundertaken. It is not enough for a good physician to examine the\r\nsymptoms of his patient. He must have a full and faithful history\r\nof the case. He must know how the disease originated, and how it\r\nwas treated. If injuries were inflicted, he must know under what\r\ncircumstances, how they affected the nervous system, and whether there\r\nmay not be surrounding influences which prevent the restoration of\r\nhealth, or some nuisance that poisons the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSuch a history of the case of Ireland the author has endeavoured\r\nto give in the following pages. It it is no perfunctory service. He\r\nresolved to do it years ago, when he finished his work on the Irish\r\nChurch Establishment, and it has been delayed only in consequence of\r\nillness and other engagements. He does not boast of any extraordinary\r\nqualifications for the work. But he claims the advantage of having\r\nstudied the subject long and earnestly, as one in which he has been\r\ninterested from his youth. He has written the history of the country\r\nmore or less fully three times. During his thirty years' connexion\r\nwith the press, it has been his duty to examine and discuss everything\r\nthat appeared before the public upon Irish questions, and it has\r\nalways been his habit to bring the light of history to bear upon the\r\ntopics of the day. Twenty years ago he was an active member of the\r\nIrish Tenant League, which held great county meetings in most parts of\r\nthe island; and was enthusiastically supported by the tenant farmers,\r\nadopting resolutions and petitions on the land question almost\r\nidentical with those passed by similar meetings at the present time.\r\nThen Mr. Sharman Crawford was the only landlord who joined in the\r\nmovement; now many of the largest proprietors take their stand on the\r\ntenant-right platform. And after a generation of sectarian division\r\nand religious dissension in Ulster, stimulated by the landed gentry,\r\nfor political purposes, the Catholic priests and the Presbyterian\r\nclergy have again united to advocate the demands of the people for the\r\nlegal protection of their industry and their property.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a county in Ireland which the author of this\r\nvolume has not traversed more than once, having always an eye to the\r\ncondition of the population, their mode of living, and the\r\nrelations of the different classes. During the past year, as special\r\ncommissioner of the _Irish Times_, he went through the greater part of\r\nUlster, and portions of the south, in order to ascertain the feelings\r\nof the farmers and the working classes, on the great question which is\r\nabout to engage the attention of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe result of his historical studies and personal enquiries is\r\nthis:--All the maladies of Ireland, which perplex statesmen and\r\neconomists, have arisen from injuries inflicted by England in the wars\r\nwhich she waged to get possession of the Irish land. Ireland has been\r\nirreconcilable, not because she was conquered by England, not\r\neven because she was persecuted, but because she was robbed of her\r\ninheritance. If England had done everything she has done against the\r\nIrish nation, omitting the _confiscations_, the past would have been\r\nforgotten and condoned long ago, and the two nations would have been\r\none people. Even the religious wars resolve themselves into efforts to\r\nretain the land, or to recover the forfeited estates. And the banished\r\nchiefs never could have rallied the nation to arms, as they so often\r\ndid against overwhelming odds, if the people had not been involved in\r\nthe ruin of their lords. All that is really important in the history\r\nof the country for the last three centuries is, the fighting of the\r\ntwo nations for the possession of the soil. The Reformation was\r\nin reality nothing but a special form of the land war. The oath of\r\nsupremacy was simply a lever for evicting the owners of the land. The\r\nprocess was simple. The king demanded spiritual allegiance; refusal\r\nwas high treason; the punishment of high treason was forfeiture of\r\nestates, with death or banishment to the recusants. Any other law they\r\nmight have obeyed, and retained their inheritance. This law fixed\r\nits iron grapples in the conscience, and made obedience impossible,\r\nwithout a degree of baseness that rendered life intolerable.\r\nHence Protestantism was detested, not so much as a religion, as an\r\ninstrument of spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe agrarian wars were kept up from generation to generation, Ireland\r\nalways making desperate efforts to get back her inheritance, but\r\nalways crushed to the earth, a victim of famine and the sword, by the\r\npower of England.\r\n\r\nThe history of these wars, then, is the history of the case of the\r\nIrish patient. Its main facts are embodied in the general history of\r\nthe country. But they have recently been brought out more distinctly\r\nby authors who have devoted years to the examination of the original\r\nstate papers, in which the actors themselves described their exploits\r\nand recorded their motives and feelings with startling frankness. When\r\na task of this kind has been performed by a capable and conscientious\r\nhistorian, it would be a work of supererogation for another enquirer\r\nto undergo the wearisome toil, even if he could. I have, therefore,\r\nfor the purpose of my argument, freely availed myself of the materials\r\ngiven to the public by Mr. Froude, the Rev. C.P. Meehan, and Mr.\r\nPrendergast, not, however, without asking their permission, which was\r\nin each case most readily and kindly granted.\r\n\r\nThe ancient state of Ireland, and especially of Ulster, is so little\r\nknown in England, that I was glad to have the facts vouched for by\r\nso high an authority as Mr. Froude, and a writer so full of the\r\ninstinctive pride of the dominant nation; the more so as I have often\r\nbeen obliged to dissent from his views, and to appeal against his\r\njudgments. Beguiled by the beauty of his descriptions, I am afraid I\r\nhave drawn too largely on his pages, in proving and illustrating\r\nmy case; but I feel confident that no one will read these extracts\r\nwithout more eagerly desiring to possess the volumes of his great work\r\nfrom which they are taken.\r\n\r\nI have similar acknowledgments to make to Father Meehan and Mr.\r\nPrendergast, both of whom are preparing new editions of their most\r\nvaluable works. The royal charters, and other documents connected\r\nwith the Plantation of Ulster, are printed in the 'Concise View of the\r\nIrish Society,' compiled from their records, and published by their\r\nauthority in 1832. Whenever I have been indebted to other writers,\r\nI have acknowledged my obligation in the course of the work. In\r\npreparing it, I have had but one object constantly in view: to present\r\nto the public a careful collection and an impartial statement of facts\r\non the state of Ireland, for the right government of which the British\r\npeople are now more than ever responsible. I shall be thankful if my\r\nlabours should contribute in any measure, however humble, to the new\r\nconquest of Ireland 'by justice' of which Mr. Bright has spoken.\r\nHis language is suggestive. It is late (happily not 'too late') to\r\ncommence the reign of justice. But the nation is not to be despised\r\nwhich requires nothing more than _that_ to win its heart, while its\r\nspirit could not be conquered by centuries of injustice. Nor should it\r\nbe forgotten by the people of England that some atonement is due for\r\npast wrongs, not the least of which is the vilification and distrust\r\nfrom which the Irish people have suffered so much. 'The spirit of a\r\nman may sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?'\r\nSome manifestation of Christian magnanimity just now would greatly\r\nhelp the work of national reconciliation. The time is favourable. The\r\nGovernment enjoys the prestige of an unparalleled success. The only\r\nPrime Minister that ever dared to do full justice to Ireland, is the\r\nmost powerful that England has had for nearly a century. He has in\r\nhis Cabinet the only Chief Secretary of Ireland that ever thoroughly\r\nsympathised with the nation, not excepting Lord Morpeth; the great\r\ntribune of the English people, who has been one of the most eloquent\r\nadvocates of Ireland; an Ex-Viceroy who has pronounced it felony\r\nfor the Irish landlords to avail themselves of their legal rights,\r\nalthough he put down a rebellion which that felony mainly provoked;\r\nanother Ex-Governor, who was one of the most earnest and conscientious\r\nthat ever filled the viceregal throne, and who returned to Parliament\r\nto be one of the ablest champions of the country he had ruled so well;\r\nnot to mention other members of commanding ability, who are solemnly\r\npledged to the policy of justice. In these facts there is great\r\npromise. He understands little of 'the signs of the times,' who does\r\nnot see the dangers that hang on the non-fulfilment of this promise.\r\n\r\nJ.G.\r\n\r\nLONDON: _January 20_, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I.

The alarmists conjure up gigantic\r\napparitions more formidable than those which encountered Bunyan's\r\nPilgrim. Monstrous figures frown along the gloomy avenue that, leads\r\nup to the Egyptian temple in which the divinity, PROPERTY, dwells in\r\nmysterious darkness. To enter the sanctuary, we are solemnly\r\nassured, requires all the cardinal virtues in their highest state of\r\ndevelopment--the firmest faith, the most vivid hope, and the charity\r\nthat never faileth. But this is not the only country that has had a\r\nland question to settle. Almost every nation in Europe has done for\r\nitself what England is now palled upon to do for Ireland. In fact,\r\nit is a necessary process in the transition from feudalism to\r\nconstitutional self-government. Feudalism gave the land to a few whom\r\nit made princes and lords, having forcibly taken it from the many,\r\nwhom it made subjects and serfs. The land is the natural basis of\r\nsociety. The Normans made it the artificial basis of a class. Society\r\nin nearly every other country has reverted back to its original\r\nfoundations, and so remains firm and strong without dangerous rents or\r\nfissures. No doubt, the operation is difficult and critical. But what\r\nhas been done once may be done again; and as it was England that kept\r\nIrish society so long rocking on its smaller end, it is her duty\r\nnow to lend all her strength to help to seat it on its own broad\r\nfoundations. Giving up the Viceroy's dreams that the glorious mission\r\nof Ireland was to be a kitchen garden, a dairy, a larder for England,\r\nwe must come frankly to the conclusion that the national life of the\r\nIrish people, without distinction of creed or party, increases\r\nin vigour with their intelligence, and is now invincible. Let the\r\nimperial legislature put an end for ever to such an unnatural state of\r\nthings--thus only can they secure the harmonious working and cordial\r\nUnion of the two nations united together in one State--thus only can\r\nthey insure for the landlords themselves all the power and all\r\nthe influence that can be retained by them in consistency with the\r\nindustrial rights and political freedom of the cultivators of the\r\nsoil. These now complain of their abject dependence, and hopeless\r\nbondage, under grinding injustice. They are alleged to be full of\r\ndiscontent, which must grow with the intelligence and manhood of the\r\npeople who writhe under the system. Their advocates affirm that their\r\ndiscontent must increase in volume and angry force every year, and\r\nthat, owing to the connection of Ireland with the United States,\r\nit may at any time be suddenly swollen with the fury of a mountain\r\ntorrent, deeply discoloured by a Republican element.\r\n\r\nIt must be granted, I fear, that the Celts of Ireland feel pretty much\r\nas the Britons felt under the ascendency of the Saxons, and as the\r\nSaxons in their turn felt under the ascendency of the Normans. In\r\nthe estimation of the Christian Britons, their Saxon conquerors,\r\neven after the conversion of the latter, were 'an accursed race, the\r\nchildren of robbers and murderers, possessing the fruits of their\r\nfathers' crimes.' 'With them,' says Dr. Lingard, 'the Saxon was no\r\nbetter than a pagan bearing the name of a Christian. They refused to\r\nreturn his salutation, to join in prayer with him in the church, to\r\nsit with him at the same table, to abide with him under the same roof.\r\nThe remnant of his meals and the food over which he had made the sign\r\nof the cross they threw to their dogs or swine; the cup out of\r\nwhich he had drunk they scoured with sand, as if it had contracted\r\ndefilement from his lips.'\r\n\r\nIt is not the Celtic memory only that is tenacious of national wrong.\r\nThe Saxon was doomed to drink to the dregs the same bitter cup which\r\nhe administered so unmercifully to the Briton. His Teutonic blood\r\nsaved him from no humiliation or insult. The Normans seized all the\r\nlands, all the castles, all the pleasant mansions, all the churches\r\nand monasteries. Even the Saxon saints were flung down out of their\r\nshrines and trampled in the dust under the iron heel of the Christian\r\nconqueror. Everything Saxon was vile, and the word 'Englishry' implied\r\nas much contempt and scorn as the word 'Irishry' in a later age. In\r\nfact, the subjugated Saxons gradually became infected with all the\r\nvices and addicted to all the social disorders that prevailed among\r\nthe Irish in the same age; only in Ireland the anarchy endured much\r\nlonger from the incompleteness of the conquest and the absence of the\r\nseat of supreme government, which kept the races longer separate and\r\nantagonistic. Perhaps the most humiliating notice of the degrading\r\neffects of conquest on the noble Saxon race to be found in history,\r\nis the language in which Giraldus Cambrensis, the reviler of the Irish\r\nCelt, contrasts them with his countrymen, the Welsh. 'Who dare,'\r\nhe says, 'compare the English, the most degraded of all races under\r\nheaven, with the Welsh? In their own country they are the serfs,\r\nthe veriest slaves of the Normans. In ours whom else have we for our\r\nherdsmen, shepherds, cobblers, skinners, cleaners of our dog kennels,\r\nay, even of our privies, but Englishmen? Not to mention their original\r\ntreachery to the Britons, that hired by them to defend them they\r\nturned upon them in spite of their oaths and engagements, they are\r\nto this day given to treachery and murder.' The lying Saxon was,\r\naccording to this authority, a proverbial expression.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon writers lamented their miserable subjection in a monotonous\r\nwail for many generations. So late as the seventeenth century an\r\nEnglish author speaks in terms of compassion of the disinherited\r\nand despoiled families who had sunk into the condition of artisans,\r\npeasants, and paupers. 'This,' says M. Thierry, 'is the last sorrowful\r\nglance cast back through the mist of ages on that great event which\r\nestablished in England a race of kings, nobles, and warriors of\r\nforeign extraction. The reader must figure to himself, not a mere\r\nchange of political rule, not the triumph of one of two competitors,\r\nbut the intrusion of a nation into the bosom of another people which\r\nit came to destroy, and the scattered fragments of which it retained\r\nas an integral portion of the new system of society, in the _status_\r\nmerely of personal property, or, to use the stronger language of\r\nrecords and deeds, _a clothing of the soil_. He must not picture to\r\nhimself on the one hand the king and despot; on the other simply his\r\nsubjects, high and low, rich and poor, all inhabiting England, and\r\nconsequently all English. He must bear in mind that there were two\r\ndistinct nations--the old Anglo-Saxon race and the Norman invaders,\r\ndwelling intermingled on the same soil; or, rather, he might\r\ncontemplate two countries--the one possessed by the Normans, wealthy\r\nand exonerated from public burdens, the other enslaved and oppressed\r\nwith a land tax--the former full of spacious mansions, of walled\r\ntowns, and moated castles--the latter occupied with thatched cabins,\r\nand ancient walls in a state of dilapidation. This peopled with\r\nthe happy and the idle, with soldiers, courtiers, knights, and\r\nnobles--that with miserable men condemned to labour as peasants and\r\nartisans. On the one side he beholds luxury and insolence, on the\r\nother poverty and envy--not the envy of the poor at the sight of\r\nopulence and men born to opulence, but that malignant envy, although\r\njustice be on its side, which the despoiled cannot but entertain on\r\nlooking upon the spoilers. Lastly, to complete the picture, these two\r\ncountries are in some sort interwoven with each other--they meet\r\nat every point, and yet they are more distinct, more completely\r\nseparated, than if the ocean rolled between them.'\r\n\r\nDoes not this picture look very like Ireland? To make it more like,\r\nlet us imagine that the Norman king had lived in Paris, and kept a\r\nviceroy in London--that the English parliament were subordinate to the\r\nFrench parliament, composed exclusively of Normans, and governed by\r\nNorman undertakers for the benefit of the dominant State--that the\r\nwhole of the English land was held by ten thousand Norman proprietors,\r\nmany of them absentees--that all the offices of the government, in\r\nevery department, were in the hands of Normans--that, differing in\r\nreligion with the English nation, the French, being only a tenth of\r\nthe population, had got possession of all the national churches and\r\nchurch property, while the poor natives supported a numerous hierarchy\r\nby voluntary contributions--that the Anglo-Norman parliament was\r\nbribed and coerced to abolish itself, forming a union of England with\r\nFrance, in which the English members were as one to six. Imagine that\r\nin consequence of rebellions the land of England had been confiscated\r\nthree or four times, after desolating wars and famines, so that all\r\nthe native proprietors were expelled, and the land was parcelled\r\nout to French soldiers and adventurers on condition that the foreign\r\n'planters' should assist in keeping down 'the mere English' by force\r\nof arms. Imagine that the English, being crushed by a cruel penal\r\ncode for a century, were allowed to reoccupy the soil as mere\r\ntenants-at-will, under the absolute power of their French landlords.\r\nIf all this be imagined by English legislators and English writers,\r\nthey will be better able to understand the Irish land question, and to\r\ncomprehend the nature of 'Irish difficulties,' as well as the justice\r\nof feeble, insincere, and baffled statesmen in casting the blame\r\nof Irish misery and disorder on the unruly and barbarous nature of\r\nIrishmen. They will recollect that the aristocracy of Ireland are the\r\nhigh-spirited descendants of conquerors, with the instinct of conquest\r\nstill in their blood. The parliament which enacted the Irish land laws\r\nwas a parliament composed almost exclusively of men of this dominant\r\nrace. They made all political power dependent on the ownership of\r\nland, thus creating for themselves a monopoly which it is not in human\r\nnature to surrender without a struggle.\r\n\r\nThe possession of this monopoly, however, fully accounts for two\r\nthings--the difficulty which the landlords feel in admitting the\r\njustice of the tenant's claims for the legal recognition of the value\r\nwhich his labour has added to the soil, and the extreme repugnance\r\nwith which they regard any legislation on the subject. Besides,\r\nthe want of sympathy with the people, of earnestness and courage in\r\nmeeting the realities of the case, is conspicuous in all attempts\r\nof the kind during the last half-century. Those attempts have been\r\nevasive, feeble, abortive--concessions to the demand that _something_\r\nmust be done, but so managed that nothing should be done to weaken the\r\npower of the eight thousand proprietors over the mass of the nation\r\ndependent on the land for their existence. Hence has arisen a great\r\namount of jealousy, distrust, and irritability in the landlord class\r\ntowards the tenantry and their advocates.\r\n\r\nThe Irish race, to adopt Thierry's language, are full of 'malignant\r\nenvy' towards the lords of the soil; not because they are rich, but\r\nbecause they have the people so completely in their power, so entirely\r\nat their mercy for all that man holds most dear. The tenants feel\r\nbitterly when they think that they have no legal right to live on\r\ntheir native land. They have read the history of our dreadful civil\r\nwars, famines, and confiscations. They know that by the old law of\r\nIreland, and by custom from times far beyond the reach of authentic\r\nhistory, the clans and tribes of the Celtic people occupied certain\r\ndistricts with which their names are still associated, and that the\r\nland was inalienably theirs. Rent or tribute they paid, indeed, to\r\ntheir princes, and if they failed the chiefs came with armed followers\r\nand helped themselves, driving away cows, sheep, and horses sufficient\r\nto meet their demand, or more if they were unscrupulous, which was\r\n'distress' with a vengeance. But the eviction of the people even for\r\nnon-payment of rent, and putting other people in their place, were\r\nthings never heard of among the Irish under their own rulers. The\r\nchief had his own mensal lands, as well as his tribute, and these he\r\nmight forfeit. But as the clansmen could not control his acts, they\r\ncould never see the justice of being punished for his misdeeds by\r\nthe confiscation of their lands, and driven from the homes of their\r\nancestors often made doubly sacred by religious associations.\r\n\r\nHistory, moreover, teaches them that, as a matter of fact, the\r\ngovernment in the reign of James I.--and James himself in repeated\r\nproclamations--assured the people who occupied the lands of O'Neill\r\nand O'Donnell at the time of their flight that they would be protected\r\nin all their rights if they remained quiet and loyal, which they\r\ndid. Yet they were nearly all removed to make way for the English and\r\nScotch settlers.\r\n\r\nThus, historical investigators have been digging around the\r\nfoundations of Irish landlordism. They declare that those foundations\r\nwere cemented with blood, and they point to the many wounds still open\r\nfrom which that blood issued so profusely. The facts of the conquest\r\nand confiscation were hinted at by the Devon Commissioners as\r\naccounting for the peculiar difficulties of the Irish land question,\r\nand writers on it timidly allude to 'the historic past' as originating\r\ninfluences still powerful in alienating landlords and tenants, and\r\nfostering mutual distrust between them. But the time for evasion and\r\ntimidity has passed. We must now honestly and courageously face\r\nthe stern realities of this case. Among these realities is a firm\r\nconviction in the minds of many landlords that they are in no sense\r\ntrustees for the community, but that they have an absolute power over\r\ntheir estates--that they can, if they like, strip the land clean of\r\nits human clothing, and clothe it with sheep or cattle instead, or lay\r\nit bare and desolate, let it lapse into a wilderness, or sow it with\r\nsalt. That is in reality the terrific power secured to them by the\r\npresent land code, to be executed through the Queen's writ and by the\r\nQueen's troops--a power which could not stand a day if England did not\r\nsustain it by overwhelming military force.\r\n\r\nAnother of the realities of the question is the no less inveterate\r\nconviction in the tenants' mind that the absolute power of the\r\nlandlord was originally a usurpation effected by the sword. Right or\r\nwrong, they believe that the confiscations were the palpable violation\r\nof the natural rights of the people whom Providence placed in this\r\ncountry. With bitter emphasis they assert that no set of men has any\r\ndivine right to root a nation out of its own land. Painful as this\r\nstate of feeling is, there is no use in denying that it exists. Here,\r\nthen, is the deep radical difference that is to be removed. Here are\r\nthe two conflicting forces which are to be reconciled. This is the\r\nreal Irish land question. All other points are minor and of easy\r\nadjustment. The people say, and, I believe, sincerely, that they are\r\nwilling to pay a fair rent, according to a public valuation--not a\r\nrent imposed arbitrarily by one of the interested parties, which\r\nmight be raised so as to ruin the occupier. The feelings of these two\r\nparties often clash so violently, there is such instinctive distrust\r\nbetween them, the peace and prosperity of the country depend so much\r\non their coming to terms and putting an end to their long-standing\r\nfeud, that it is still more imperatively necessary than in the\r\nChurch question, that a third party, independent, impartial, and\r\nauthoritative, should intervene and heal the breach.\r\n\r\nThere was one phrase constantly ringing in the ears of the Devon\r\nCommissioners, and now, after nearly a generation has passed away, it\r\nis ringing in the ears of the nation louder than ever--'_the want\r\nof tenure_.' All the evidence went to show that the want of security\r\nparalysed industry and impeded social progress. It seems strange that\r\nany evidence should be thought necesary to prove that a man will not\r\nsow if he does not hope to reap, and that he will not build houses for\r\nstrangers to enjoy. This would be taken as an axiom anywhere out of\r\nIreland. Of all the people in Europe, the Irish have suffered most\r\nfrom the oppression of those who, from age to age, had power in the\r\ncountry. Whoever fought or conquered, they were always the victims;\r\nand it is a singular fact that their sufferings are scarcely ever\r\nnoticed by the contemporary annalists, even when those annalists\r\nwere ecclesiastics. The extent to which they were slaughtered in the\r\nperpetual wars between the native chiefs, and in the wars between\r\nthose chiefs and the English, is something awful to contemplate, not\r\nto speak of the wholesale destruction of life by the famines which\r\nthose wars entailed. On several occasions the Celtic race seemed very\r\nnearly extinct. The penal code, with all its malign influence, had one\r\ngood effect. It subdued to a great extent the fighting propensities\r\nof the people, and fused the clans into one nation, purified by\r\nsuffering. Since that time, in spite of occasional visitations of\r\ncalamity, they have been steadily rising in the social scale, and they\r\nare now better off than ever they were in their whole history. When\r\nwe review the stages by which they have risen, we cannot but feel at\r\ntimes grieved and indignant at the opportunities for tranquillising\r\nand enriching the country which were lost through the ignorance,\r\napathy, bigotry, and selfishness of the legislature. There was no end\r\nof commissions and select committees to inquire into the condition\r\nof the agricultural population, whenever Parliament was roused by the\r\nprevalence of agrarian outrages. They reported, and there the matter\r\nended. There were always insuperable difficulties when the natives\r\nwere to be put in a better position. Between 1810 and 1814, for\r\nexample, a commission reported four times on the condition of\r\nthe Irish bogs. They expressed their entire conviction of the\r\npracticability of cultivating with profit an immense extent of land\r\nlying waste. In 1819, in 1823, in 1826, and in 1830, select committees\r\ninquired into and reported on drainage, reclamation of bogs and\r\nmarshes, on roads, fisheries, emigration, and other schemes for giving\r\nemployment to the redundant population that had been encouraged to\r\nincrease and multiply in the most reckless manner, while 'war\r\nprices' were obtained for agricultural produce, and the votes of the\r\nforty-shilling freeholders were wanted by the landlords. When, by the\r\nEmancipation Act in 1829, the forty-shilling franchise was abolished,\r\nthe peasant lost his political value. After the war, when the price of\r\ncorn fell very low, and, consequently, tillage gave place to grazing,\r\nlabourers became to the middleman an encumbrance and a nuisance that\r\nmust be cleared off the land, just as weeds are plucked up and flung\r\nout to wither on the highway. Then came Lord Devon's Land Commission,\r\nwhich inquired on the eve of the potato failure and the great famine.\r\nThe Irish population was now at its highest figure--between eight and\r\nnine millions. Yet, though there had been three bad seasons, it was\r\nclearly proved at that time that by measures which a wise and willing\r\nlegislature would have promptly passed, the whole surplus population\r\ncould have been profitably employed.\r\n\r\nIn this great land controversy, on which side lies the truth? Is it\r\nthe fault of the people, or the fault of the law, that the country is\r\nbut half cultivated, while the best of the peasantry are emigrating\r\nwith hostile feelings and purposes of vengeance towards England? As\r\nto the landlords, as a class, they use their powers with as much\r\nmoderation and mercy as any other class of men in any country ever\r\nused power so vast and so little restrained. The best and most\r\nindulgent landlords, the most genial and generous, are unquestionably\r\nthe old nobility, the descendants of the Normans and Saxons, those\r\nvery conquerors of whom we have heard so much. The worst, the most\r\nharsh and exacting, are those who have purchased under the Landed\r\nEstates Court--strangers to the people, who think only of the\r\npercentage on their capital. We had heard much of the necessity of\r\ncapital to develope the resources of the land. The capital came,\r\nbut the development consists in turning tillage lands into pasture,\r\nclearing out the labouring population and sending them to the\r\npoorhouse, or shipping them off at a few pounds per head to keep down\r\nthe rates. And yet is it not possible to set all our peasantry to work\r\nat the profitable cultivation of their native land? Is it not possible\r\nto establish by law what many landlords act upon as the rule of their\r\nestates--namely, the principle that no man is to be evicted so long as\r\nhe pays a fair rent, and the other principle, that whenever he fails,\r\nhe is entitled to the market value by public sale of all the property\r\nin his holding beyond that fair rent? The hereditary principle,\r\nrightly cherished among the landlords, so conservative in its\r\ninfluence, ought to be equally encouraged among the tenants. The man\r\nof industry, as well as the man of rank, should be able to feel that\r\nhe is providing for his children, that his farm is at once a bank and\r\nan insurance office, in which all his minute daily deposits of toil\r\nand care and skill will be safe and productive. This is the way to\r\nenrich and strengthen the State, and to multiply guarantees against\r\nrevolution--not by consolidation of farms and the abandonment of\r\ntillage, not by degrading small holders into day labourers, levelling\r\nthe cottages and filling the workhouses.\r\n\r\nIf the legislature were guided by the spirit that animates Lord Erne\r\nin his dealings with his tenantry, the land question would soon\r\nbe settled to the satisfaction of all parties. 'I think,' said his\r\nlordship, 'as far as possible, every tenant on my estate may call his\r\nfarm his castle, as long as he conducts himself honestly, quietly, and\r\nindustriously; and, should he wish to leave in order to find a better\r\nlandlord, I allow him to sell his farm, provided he pleases me in a\r\ntenant. Therefore, if a man lays out money on his farm judiciously, he\r\nis certain to receive back the money, should he wish to go elsewhere.'\r\nHe mentioned three cases of sale which occurred last year. One tenant\r\nsold a farm of seventy acres in bad order for 570 l., another thirty\r\nacres for 300 l., and a third the same number of acres in worse\r\ncondition for 200 l. The landlord lost nothing by these changes. His\r\nrent was paid up, and in each case he got a good tenant for a bad one.\r\nLord Erne is a just man, and puts on no more than a fair rent. But\r\nall landlords are not just, as all tenants are not honest. Even where\r\ntenant-right is admitted in name, it is obvious that the rent may be\r\nraised so high as to make the farm worth nothing in the market. To\r\ngive to the tenant throughout the country generally the pleasant\r\nfeeling that his farm is his castle, which he can make worth more\r\nmoney every day he rises, there must be a public letting valuation,\r\nand this the State could easily provide. And then there should be the\r\nright of sale to the highest solvent bidder.\r\n\r\nThis might be one way of securing permanent tenure, or stimulating the\r\nindustry and sustaining the thrift of the farmer. But the nature\r\nof the different tenures, and the effect of each in bracing up or\r\nrelaxing the nerves of industry, will be the object of deliberation\r\nwith the Government and the legislature. It is said that, in the hands\r\nof small farmers, proprietorship leads to endless subdivision; that\r\nlong leases generally cause bad husbandry; that tenants-at-will often\r\nfeel themselves more secure and safe than a contract could make them;\r\nthat families have lived on the same farm for generations without a\r\nscrape of a pen except the receipt for rent. On the other hand, there\r\nis the general cry of 'want of tenure;' there is the custom of serving\r\nnotices to quit, sometimes for other reasons than non-payment of rent;\r\nthere are occasional barbarities in the levelling of villages, and\r\ndragging the aged and the sick from the old roof-tree, the parting\r\nfrom which rends their heart-strings; and, above all, there is the\r\nfeeling among the peasantry which makes them look without horror on\r\nthe murder of a landlord or an agent who was a kind and benevolent\r\nneighbour; and, lastly, the paramount consideration for the\r\nlegislature, that a large portion of the people are disaffected to\r\nthe State, and ready to join its enemies, and this almost solely on\r\naccount of the state of the law relating to land. Hence the necessity\r\nof settling the question as speedily as possible, and the duty of all\r\nwho have the means to contribute something towards that most desirable\r\nconsummation, which seems to be all that is wanted to make Irishmen of\r\nevery class work together earnestly for the welfare of their country.\r\nIt is admitted that no class of men in the world has improved more\r\nthan the Irish landlords during the last twenty years. Let the\r\nlegislature restore confidence between them and the people by taking\r\naway all ground for the suspicion that they wish to extirpate the\r\nCeltic race.\r\n\r\nNor was this suspicion without cause, as the following history will\r\ntoo clearly prove. A very able English writer has said: 'The policy\r\nof all the successive swarms of settlers was to extirpate the native\r\nCeltic race, but every effort made to break up the old framework\r\nof society failed, for the new-comers soon became blended with and\r\nundistinguishable from the mass of the people--being obliged to ally\r\nthemselves with the native chieftains, rather than live hemmed in by a\r\nfiery ring of angry septs and exposed to perpetual war with everything\r\naround them. Merged in the great Celtic mass, they adopted Irish\r\nmanners and names, yet proscribed and insulted the native inhabitants\r\nas an inferior race. Everything liberal towards them is intercepted in\r\nits progress.\r\n\r\n'The past history of Ulster is but a portion of Scottish history\r\ninserted into that of Ireland--a stone in the Irish mosaic of an\r\nentirely different quality and colour from the pieces that surround\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'Thus it came to pass that, through the confiscation of their lands\r\nand the proscription of their religion, popery was worked by a most\r\nvehement process into the blood and brain of the Irish nation.'\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the Irish must be an inferior race, since\r\nthey allowed themselves to be subjugated by some thousands of English\r\ninvaders. But it should be recollected, first, that the conquest,\r\ncommenced by Henry II. in the twelfth century, was not completed till\r\nthe seventeenth century, when the King's writ ran for the first time\r\nthrough the province of Ulster, the ancient kingdom of the O'Neills;\r\nin the second place, the weakness of the Celtic communities was not so\r\nmuch the fault of the men as of their institutions, brought with them\r\nfrom the East and clung to with wonderful tenacity. So long as they\r\nhad boundless territory for their flocks and herds, and could always\r\nmove on 'to pastures new,' they increased and multiplied, and allowed\r\nthe sword and the battle-axe to rest, unless when a newly elected\r\nchief found it necessary to give his followers 'a hosting'--which\r\nmeans an expedition for plunder. Down to the seventeenth century,\r\nafter five hundred years' contact with the Teutonic race, they were\r\nessentially the same people as they were when the ancient Greeks\r\nand Romans knew them. They are thus described by Dr. Mommsen in his\r\n'History of Rome:'--'Such qualities--those of good soldiers and of bad\r\ncitizens--explain the historical fact that the Celts have shaken all\r\nStates and have _founded none_. Everywhere we find them ready to rove,\r\nor, in other words, to march, preferring movable property to landed\r\nestate, and gold to everything else; following the profession of arms\r\nas a system of organised pillage, or even as a trade for hire, and\r\nwith such success that even the Roman historian, Sallust, acknowledges\r\nthat the Celts bore off the prize from the Romans in feats of arms.\r\nThey were the true 'soldiers of fortune' of antiquity, as pictures and\r\ndescriptions represent them, with big but sinewy bodies, with shaggy\r\nhair and long moustaches--quite a contrast to the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwho shaved the upper lip--in the variegated embroidered dresses which\r\nin combat were not unfrequently thrown off, with a broad gold ring\r\nround their neck, wearing no helmets and without missile weapons\r\nof any sort, but furnished instead with an immense shield, a long\r\nill-tempered sword, a dagger and a lance, all ornamented with gold,\r\nfor they were not unskilful in working in metals. Everything was made\r\nsubservient to ostentation--even wounds, which were often enlarged for\r\nthe purpose of boasting a broader scar. Usually they fought on foot,\r\nbut certain tribes on horseback, in which case every free man was\r\nfollowed by two attendants, likewise mounted. War-chariots were early\r\nin use, as they were among the Libyans and Hellenes in the earliest\r\ntimes. Many a trait reminds us of the chivalry of the middle ages,\r\nparticularly the custom of single combat, which was foreign to the\r\nGreeks and Romans. Not only were they accustomed in war to challenge\r\na single enemy to fight, after having previously insulted him by words\r\nand gestures; in peace also they fought with each other in splendid\r\nequipments, as for life or death. After such feats carousals followed\r\nin due course. In this way they led, whether under their own or\r\na foreign banner, a restless soldier life, constantly occupied in\r\nfighting and in their so-called feats of heroism. They were dispersed\r\nfrom _Ireland_ and Spain to Asia Minor, but all their enterprises\r\nmelted away like snow in spring, and they nowhere created a great\r\nstate or developed a distinctive culture of their own.' Such were\r\nthe people who once almost terminated the existence of Rome, and were\r\nafterwards with difficulty repulsed from Greece, who became masters of\r\nthe most fertile part of Italy and of a fair province in the heart\r\nof Asia Minor, who, after their Italian province had been subdued,\r\ninflicted disastrous blows on successive Roman generals, and were only\r\nat last subjugated by Cæsar himself in nine critical and sometimes\r\nmost dangerous campaigns, B.C. 51.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr observes that at that time the form of government was\r\neverywhere an hereditary monarchy, which, when Cæsar went into Gaul,\r\nhad been swallowed up, as had the authority of the Senate, in the\r\nanarchy of the nobles. Their freedom was lawlessness; an inherent\r\nincapacity of living under the dominion of laws distinguishes them as\r\nbarbarians from the Greeks and Italians. As individuals had to procure\r\nthe protection of some magnate in order to live in safety, so the\r\nweaker tribes took shelter under the patronage of a more powerful one.\r\nFor they were a disjointed multitude; and when any people had in\r\nthis manner acquired an extensive sovereignty, they exercised it\r\narbitrarily until its abuses became intolerable, or their subjects\r\nwere urged by blind hatred of their power to fall off from them, and\r\ngather round some new centre. The sole bond of union was the Druidical\r\nhierarchy which, at least in Cæsar's time, was common to both nations.\r\nBoth of them paid obedience to its tribunal, which administered\r\njustice once a year--an institution which probably was not introduced\r\ntill long after the age of migrations, when the expulsion of the\r\nvanquished had ceased to be regarded as the end of war, and which must\r\nhave been fostered by the constant growth of lawlessness in particular\r\nstates--being upheld by the _ban_, which excluded the contumacious\r\nfrom all intercourse in divine worship and in daily life with the\r\nfaithful. The huge bodies, wild features, and long shaggy hair of the\r\nmen, gave a ghastliness to their aspect. This, along with their fierce\r\ncourage, their countless numbers, and the noise made by an enormous\r\nmultitude of horns and trumpets, struck the armies arrayed against\r\nthem with fear and amazement. If these, however, did not allow\r\ntheir terror to overpower them, the want of order, discipline, and\r\nperseverance would often enable an inferior number to vanquish a vast\r\nhost of the barbarians. Besides, they were but ill equipped. Few of\r\nthem wore any armour; their narrow shields, which were of the same\r\nheight with their bodies, were weak and clumsy; they rushed upon their\r\nenemies with broad thin battle-swords of bad steel, which the first\r\nblow upon iron often notched and rendered useless. Like true savages,\r\nthey destroyed the inhabitants, the towns, and the agriculture of the\r\ncountries they conquered. They cut off the heads of the slain,\r\nand tied them by the hair to the manes of their horses. If a skull\r\nbelonged to a person of rank, they nailed it up in their houses and\r\npreserved it as an heirloom for their posterity, as the nobles in rude\r\nages do stag-horns. Towns were rare amongst them; the houses and\r\nthe villages, which were very numerous, were mean, the furniture\r\nwretched--a heap of straw covered with skins served both for a bed\r\nand a seat. They did not cultivate corn save for a very limited\r\nconsumption, for the main part of their food was the milk and the\r\nflesh of their cattle. These formed their wealth. Gold, too, they\r\nhad in abundance, derived partly from the sandy beds of their rivers,\r\npartly from some mines which these had led them to discover. It was\r\nworn in ornaments by every Gaul of rank. In battle he bore gold chains\r\non his arms and heavy gold collars round his neck, even when the upper\r\npart of his body was in other respects quite naked. For they often\r\nthrew off their parti-coloured chequered cloaks, which shone with\r\nall the hues of the rainbow, like the picturesque dress of their\r\nkinspeople the Highlanders, who have laid aside the trousers of the\r\nancient Gauls. Their duels and gross revels are an image of the rudest\r\npart of the middle ages. Their debauches were mostly committed with\r\nbeer and mead; for vines and all the plants of southern regions were\r\nas yet total strangers to the north of the Alps, where the climate in\r\nthose ages was extremely severe; so that wine was rare, though of all\r\nthe commodities imported it was the most greedily bought up.\r\n\r\nUlster was known in ancient times as one of the five Irish 'kingdoms,'\r\nand remained unconquered by the English till the reign of James I.,\r\nwhen the last prince of the great house of O'Neill, then Earl of\r\nTyrone, fled to the Continent in company with O'Donel, Earl of\r\nTyrconnel, head of another very ancient sept. Up to that period the\r\nmen of Ulster proudly regarded themselves as 'Irish of the Irish and\r\nCatholic of the Catholics.' The inhabitants were of mixed blood, but,\r\nas in the other provinces of the island, the great mass of the people,\r\nas well as the ruling classes, were of Celtic origin. Those whom\r\nethnologists still recognise as aborigines, in parts of Connaught\r\nand in some mountainous regions, an inferior race, are said to be\r\nthe descendants of the Firbolgs, or Belgae, who formed the third\r\nimmigration. They were followed and subdued by the Tuatha de\r\nDanans--men famed for their gigantic power and supernatural skill--a\r\nrace of demigods, who still live in the national superstitions. The\r\nlast of the ancient invasions was by the Gael or Celt, known as the\r\nMilesians and Scoti. The institutions and customs of this people were\r\nestablished over the whole island, and were so deeply rooted in the\r\nsoil that their remnants to this day present the greatest obstacles\r\nto the settlement of the land question according to the English model,\r\nand on the principles of political economy, which run directly counter\r\nto Irish instincts. It is truly wonderful how distinctly the present\r\ndescendants of this race preserve the leading features of their\r\nprimitive character. In France and England the Celtic character was\r\nmoulded by the power and discipline of the Roman Empire. To Ireland\r\nthis modifying influence never extended; and we find the Ulster chiefs\r\nwho fought for their territories with English viceroys 280 years ago\r\nvery little different from the men who followed Brennus to the sack\r\nof Home, and encountered the legions of Julius Cæsar on the plains of\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast observes, in the introduction to his 'Cromwellian\r\nSettlement' that when the companions of Strongbow landed in the reign\r\nof Henry II. they found a country such as Cæsar had found in Gaul\r\n1200 years before. A thousand years had passed over the island without\r\nproducing the slightest social progress--'the inhabitants divided\r\ninto tribes on the system of the clansmen and chiefs, without a common\r\nGovernment, suddenly confederating, suddenly dissolving, with Brehons,\r\nShaunahs, minstrels, bards, and harpers, in all unchanged, except that\r\nfor their ancient Druids they had got Christian priests. Had the\r\nIrish remained honest pagans, Ireland perhaps had remained unconquered\r\nstill. Round the coast strangers had built seaport towns, either\r\ntraders from the Carthaginian settlements in Spain, or outcasts from\r\ntheir own country, like the Greeks that built Marseilles. At the time\r\nof the arrival of the French and Flemish adventurers from Wales, they\r\nwere occupied by a mixed Danish and French population, who supplied\r\nthe Irish with groceries, including the wines of Poitou, the latter in\r\nsuch abundance that they had no need of vineyards.'\r\n\r\nIf vineyards had been needed, we may be sure they would not have been\r\nplanted, for the Irish Celts planted nothing. Neither did they build,\r\nexcept in the simplest and rudest way, improving their architecture\r\nfrom age to age no more than the beaver or the bee. Mr. Prendergast\r\nis an able, honest, and frank writer; yet there is something amusingly\r\nCeltic in the flourish with which he excuses the style of palaces in\r\nwhich the Irish princes delighted to dwell. 'Unlike England,' he says,\r\n'then covered with castles on the heights, where the French gentlemen\r\nsecured themselves and their families against the hatred of the churls\r\nand villains, as the English peasantry were called, the dwellings\r\nof the Irish chiefs were of wattles or clay. It is for robbers and\r\nforeigners to take to rocks and precipices for security; for native\r\nrulers, there is no such fortress _as justice and humanity_.' This\r\nis very fine, but surely Mr. Prendergast cannot mean that the Irish\r\nchiefs were distinguished by their justice and humanity. The following\r\ntouch is still grander:--'The Irish, like the wealthiest and highest\r\nof the present day, loved detached houses surrounded by fields and\r\nwoods. Towns and their walls they looked upon as tombs or sepulchres,\r\n&c.' As to fields, there were none, because the Irish never made\r\nfences, their patches of cultivated land being divided by narrow\r\nstrips of green sod. Besides, they lived in villages, which were\r\ncertainly surrounded by woods, because the woods were everywhere,\r\nand they furnished the inhabitants with fuel and shelter, as well as\r\nmaterials for building their huts.\r\n\r\nBut further on this able author expresses himself much more in\r\naccordance with the truth of history, when he states that the 'Irish\r\nenemy' was no _nation_ in the modern sense of the word, but a race\r\ndivided into many nations or tribes, _separately_ defending their\r\nlands from the English barons in the immediate neighbourhood.\r\nThere had been no ancient national government displaced, no dynasty\r\noverthrown; the Irish had _no national flag_, nor any capital city as\r\nthe metropolis of their common country, nor any common administration\r\nof law.' He might have added that they had no _mint_. There never was\r\nan Irish king who had his face stamped on a coin of his realm. Some\r\nstray pieces of money found their way into the country from abroad,\r\nbut up to the close of the sixteenth century the rudest form of barter\r\nprevailed in Ulster, and accounts were paid not in coins but in cows.\r\nEven the mechanical arts which had flourished in the country before\r\nthe arrival of the Celts had gradually perished, and had disappeared\r\nat the time of the English invasion. Any handy men could build a house\r\nof mud and wattles. Masons, carpenters, smiths, painters, glaziers,\r\n&c., were not wanted by a people who despised stone buildings as\r\nprisons, and abhorred walled towns as sepulchres. Spinning and weaving\r\nwere arts cultivated by the women, each household providing materials\r\nfor clothing, which was little used in warm weather, and thrown off\r\nwhen fighting or any other serious work was to be done.\r\n\r\nI should be sorry to disparage the Celtic race, or any other race, by\r\nexaggerating their bad qualities or suppressing any reliable testimony\r\nto their merits. But with me the truth of history is sacred. Both\r\nsides of every case should be fairly stated. Nothing can be gained by\r\nstriving to hide facts which may be known to every person who takes\r\nthe trouble to study the subject. I write in the interest of the\r\npeople--of the toiling masses; and I find that they were oppressed and\r\ndegraded by the ruling classes long before the Norman invader took\r\nthe place of the Celtic chief. And it is a curious fact that when the\r\nCromwellians turned the Catholic population out of their homes and\r\ndrove them into Connaught, they were but following the example set\r\nthem by the Milesian lords of the soil centuries before.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Darcy Magee, a real lover of his country, in his Irish\r\nhistory points out this fact. The Normans found the population divided\r\ninto two great classes--the free tribes, chiefly if not exclusively\r\nCeltic, and the unfree tribes, consisting of the descendants of the\r\nsubjugated races, or of clans once free, reduced to servitude by the\r\nsword, and the offspring of foreign mercenary soldiers. 'The unfree\r\ntribes,' says Mr. Darcy Magee, 'have left no history. Under the\r\ndespotism of the Milesian kings, it was high treason to record the\r\nactions of the conquered race, so that the Irish Belgae fared as badly\r\nin this respect at the hands of the Milesian historians as the latter\r\nfared in after times from the chroniclers of the Normans. We only know\r\nthat such tribes were, and that their numbers and physical force more\r\nthan once excited the apprehension of the children of the conquerors.\r\nOne thing is certain--the jealous policy of the superior race never\r\npermitted them to reascend the plane of equality from which they had\r\nbeen hurled at the very commencement of the Milesian ascendency.'\r\n\r\nMr. Haverty, another Catholic historian, learned, accurate, and\r\ncandid, laments the oppression of the people by their native rulers.\r\n'Those who boasted descent from the Scytho-Spanish hero would have\r\nconsidered themselves degraded were they to devote themselves to\r\nany less honourable profession than those of soldiers, _ollavs_, or\r\nphysicians; and hence the cultivation of the soil and the exercise of\r\nthe mechanic arts were left almost exclusively to the _Firbolgs_ and\r\nthe _Tuatha-de-Danans_--the former people, in particular, being still\r\nvery numerous, and forming the great mass of the population in\r\nthe west. These were ground down by high rents and the exorbitant\r\nexactions of the dominant race, _in order to support their unbounded\r\nhospitality_ and defray the expenses of costly assemblies; but this\r\noppression must have caused perpetual discontent, and the hard-working\r\nplebeians, as they were called, easily perceived that their masters\r\nwere running headlong to destruction, and that it only required a bold\r\neffort to shake off their yoke.' Then follows an account of a civil\r\nwar, one of the leaders of the revolution being elected king at its\r\ntermination. Carbry reigned five years, during which time there was no\r\nrule or order, and the country was a prey to every misfortune. 'Evil\r\nwas the state of Ireland during his reign; fruitless her corn, for\r\nthere used to be but one grain on the stalk; and fruitless her rivers;\r\nher cattle without milk; her fruit without plenty, for there used to\r\nbe but one acorn on the oak.'\r\n\r\nDr. Lynch, author of _Cambrensis Eversus_, expresses his astonishment\r\nat the great number of ancient Irish kings, most of whom were cut off\r\nby a violent death, each hewing his way to the throne over the body\r\nof his predecessor. But upon applying his mind to the more profound\r\nconsideration of the matter, he found nothing more wonderful in\r\nthe phenomenon 'than that the human family should proceed from one\r\nman--the overflowing harvest from a few grains of seed, &c.' His\r\nlearned translator, the Rev. Matthew Kelly, of Maynooth, sees proof\r\nof amendment in the fact that between 722 and 1022 twelve Irish kings\r\ndied a natural death. This candid and judicious writer observes in\r\na note--'It appears from the Irish and English annals that there\r\nwas perpetual war in Ireland during more than 400 years after the\r\ninvasion. It could not be called a war of races, except perhaps during\r\nthe first century, for English and Irish are constantly found fighting\r\nunder the same banner, according to the varying interests of the rival\r\nlords and princes of both nations. This was the case even from the\r\ncommencement.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vol. i. p.216.]\r\n\r\nMany persons have wondered at the success of small bands of English\r\ninvaders. Why did not the Irish nation rise _en masse_, and drive them\r\ninto the sea? The answer is easy. There was no Irish nation. About\r\nhalf a million of people were scattered over the island in villages,\r\ndivided into tribes generally at war with one another, each chief\r\nready to accept foreign aid against his adversary--some, perhaps,\r\nhoping thereby to attain supremacy in their clans, and others, who\r\nwere pretenders, burning to be avenged of those who had supplanted\r\nthem. It was religion that first gave the Irish race a common cause.\r\nIn the very year of the English invasion (1171) there were no fewer\r\nthan twenty predatory excursions or battles among the Irish chiefs\r\nthemselves, exclusive of contests with the invaders. Hence the Pope\r\nsaid--'_Gens se interimit mutua cæde_.' The Pope was right.\r\n\r\nThe clergy exerted themselves to the utmost in trying to exorcise the\r\ndemon of destruction and to arrest the work of extermination. Not only\r\nthe _Bashall Isa_, or 'the staff of Jesus,' but many other relics were\r\nused with the most solemn rites, to impress the people with a sense\r\nof the wickedness of their clan-fights, and to induce them to keep the\r\npeace, but in vain. The King of Connaught once broke a truce entered\r\ninto under every possible sanction of this kind, trampling upon all,\r\nthat he might get the King of Meath into his clutches. Hence the Rev.\r\nMr. Kelly is constrained to say--'It is now generally admitted by\r\nCatholic writers that however great the efforts of the Irish clergy to\r\nreform their distracted country in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,\r\nthe picture of anarchy drawn by Pope Adrian is hardly overcharged.'\r\nIndeed, some Catholic writers have confessed that the anarchy would\r\nnever have been terminated except by foreign conquest establishing a\r\nstrong central government. This, however, was not accomplished\r\ntill after a struggle of centuries, during which, except in brief\r\nintervals, when a strong prince was able to protect his people, the\r\nnational demoralisation grew worse and worse. An Oxford priest,\r\nwho kept a school at Limerick, writing so late as 1566 of the Irish\r\nnobles, says--'Of late they spare neither churches nor hallowed\r\nplaces, but thence also they fill their hands with spoil--yea, and\r\nsometimes they set them on fire and kill the men that there lie\r\nhidden.'\r\n\r\nMr. Froude, following the Irish MSS. in the Rolls House, has presented\r\ngraphic pictures of the disorders of the Irishry in the reign of Queen\r\nMary. 'The English garrison,' he says, 'harassed and pillaged the\r\nfarmers of Meath and Dublin; the chiefs made forays upon each other,\r\nkilling, robbing, and burning. When the war broke out between England\r\nand France, there were the usual conspiracies and uprisings of\r\nnationality; the young Earl of Kildare, in reward to the Queen who\r\nhad restored him to his rank, appearing as the natural leader of\r\nthe patriots. Ireland was thus happy in the gratification of all its\r\nnatural tendencies. The Brehon law readvanced upon the narrow limits\r\nto which, by the exertions of Henry VIII., the circuits of the\r\njudges had been extended. And with the Brehon law came anarchy as its\r\ninseparable attendant.'\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this view is too well attested by the records\r\nwhich the learned historian brings to light, adopting the quaint\r\nand expressive phraseology of the old writers whom he quotes. For\r\nexample:--\r\n\r\n'The lords and gentiles of the Irish Pale that were not governed under\r\nthe Queen's laws were compelled to keep and maintain a great number\r\nof idle men of war to rule their people at home, and exact from their\r\nneighbours abroad--working everyone his own wilful will for a law--to\r\nthe spoil of his country, and decay and waste of the common weal of\r\nthe same. The idle men of war ate up altogether; the lord and his men\r\ntook what they pleased, destroying their tenants, and themselves never\r\nthe better. The common people, having nothing left to lose, became as\r\nidle and careless in their behaviour as the rest, stealing by day and\r\nrobbing by night. Yet it was a state of things which they seemed all\r\nequally to enjoy, and high and low alike were always ready to bury\r\ntheir own quarrels, to join against the Queen and the English.'\r\n\r\nAt the time when the crown passed to Elizabeth the qualities of the\r\npeople were thus described by a correspondent of the council, who\r\npresents the English view of the Irishry at that time:--\r\n\r\n'The appearance and outward behaviour of the Irish showeth them to be\r\nfruits of no good tree, for they exercise no virtue and refrain and\r\nforbear from no vice, but think it lawful to do every man what him\r\nlisteth. They neither love nor dread God, nor yet hate the devil. They\r\nare worshippers of images and open idolaters. Their common oath they\r\nswear is by books, bells, and other ornaments which they do use as\r\nholy religion. Their chief and solemnest oath is by their lord or\r\nmaster's hand, which whoso forsweareth is sure to pay a fine or\r\nsustain a worse turn. The Sabbath-day they rest from all honest\r\nexercises, and the week days they are not idle, but worse occupied.\r\nThey do not honour their father and mother as much as they do\r\nreverence strangers. For every murder that they commit they do not so\r\nsoon repent, for whose blood they once shed, they lightly never cease\r\nkilling all that name. They do not so commonly commit adultery; not\r\nfor that they profess or keep chastity, but for that they seldom or\r\nnever marry, and therefore few of them are lawful heirs, by the law of\r\nthe realm, to the lands they possess. They steal but from the strong,\r\nand take by violence from the poor and weak. They know not so well who\r\nis their neighbour as who they favour; with him they will witness in\r\nright and wrong. They covet not their neighbours' good, but command\r\nall that is their neighbours' as their own. Thus they live and die,\r\nand there is none to teach them better. There are no ministers.\r\nMinisters will not take pains where there is no living to be had,\r\nneither church nor parish, but all decayed. People will not come to\r\ninhabit where there is no defence of law.'\r\n\r\nAfter six years of _discipline and improvement_ Sir Henry Sidney, in\r\n1566, described the state of the four shires, the Irish inhabitants,\r\nand the English garrison, in the following terms:--'The _English Pale_\r\nis overwhelmed with vagabonds--stealth and spoil daily carried out of\r\nit--the people miserable--not two gentlemen in the whole of it able\r\nto lend 20 l. They have neither horse nor armour, nor apparel, nor\r\nvictual. The soldiers be so beggerlike as it would abhor a general to\r\nlook on them; yet so insolent as to be intolerable to the people, so\r\nrooted in idleness as there is no hope by correction to amend them,\r\nyet so allied with the Irish, I dare not trust them in a forte, or in\r\nany dangerous service.'\r\n\r\nA sort of 'special correspondent' or 'commissioner,' as we should call\r\nhim now, furnished to Cecil a detailed account of the social condition\r\nof the people, which of course he viewed with English eyes. He found\r\nexisting among them a general organisation wherever the Irish language\r\nwas spoken--the remnants of a civilisation very ancient, but now fast\r\ntending to ruin. Next to the chiefs were the priesthood, and after\r\nthem came a kind of intellectual hierarchy, consisting of four classes\r\nof spiritual leaders and teachers, which were thus described. The\r\nfirst was called the Brehon, or the judge. These judges took\r\n'pawns' of both the parties, and then judged according to their own\r\ndiscretion. Their property was neutral, and the Irishmen would not\r\nprey upon them. They had great plenty of cattle, and they harboured\r\nmany vagabonds and idle persons. They were the chief maintainers of\r\nrebels, but when the English army came to their neighbourhood they\r\nfled to the mountains and woods 'because they would not succour\r\nthem with victuals and other necessaries.' The next sort was called\r\n_Shankee_, who had also great plenty of cattle wherewith they\r\nsuccoured the rebels. They made the ignorant men of the country\r\nbelieve that they were descended from Alexander the Great, or Darius,\r\nor Cæsar, 'or some other notable prince, which made the ignorant\r\npeople run mad, and care not what they did.' This, the correspondent\r\nremarked, 'was very hurtful to the realm.' Not less hurtful were the\r\nthird sort called _Denisdan_, who not only maintained the rebels,\r\nbut caused those that would be true to become rebellious--'thieves,\r\nextortioners, murderers, raveners, yea, and worse if it was possible.'\r\nThese seem to have been the historians or chroniclers of the tribe.\r\nIf they saw a young man, the descendant of an O' or a Mac, with half a\r\ndozen followers, they forthwith made a rhyme about his father and his\r\nancestors, numbering how many heads they had cut off, how many towns\r\nthey had burned, how many virgins they had deflowered, how many\r\nnotable murders they had done, comparing them to Hannibal, or Scipio,\r\nor Hercules, or some other famous person--'wherewithal the poor fool\r\nruns mad, and thinks indeed it is so.' Then he will gather a lot of\r\nrascals about him, and get a fortune-teller to prophesy how he is to\r\nspeed. After these preliminaries he betakes himself with his followers\r\nat night to the side of a wood, where they lurk till morning. And when\r\nit is daylight, then will they go to the poor villages, not sparing to\r\ndestroy young infants and aged people; and if a woman be ever so\r\ngreat with child, her will they kill, burning the houses and corn, and\r\nransacking the poor cots; then will they drive away all the kine\r\nand plough-horses, with all the other cattle. Then must they have a\r\nbagpipe blowing before them, and if any of the cattle fortune to wax\r\nweary or faint they will kill them rather than it should do the owner\r\ngood; and if they go by any house of friars, or religious house, they\r\nwill give them two or three beeves, and they will take them and pray\r\nfor them, yea, and praise their doings, and say, 'His father was\r\naccustomed so to do, wherein he will rejoice.' The fourth class\r\nconsisted of 'poets.' These men had great store of cattle, and 'used\r\nall the trade of the others with an addition of prophecies. They were\r\nmaintainers of witches and other vile matters, to the blasphemy of\r\nGod, and to the impoverishing of the commonwealth.'\r\n\r\nThese four septs were divided in all places of the four quarters of\r\nIreland, and some of the islands beyond Ireland, as Aran, the land of\r\nthe Saints, Innisbuffen, Innisturk, Innismain, and Innisclare. These\r\nislands, he added, were under the rule of O'Neill, and they were\r\n'very pleasant and fertile, plenty of wood, water, and arable ground,\r\npastures, and fish, and a very temperate air.' On this description\r\nMr. Froude remarks in a note--'At present they are barren heaps of\r\ntreeless moors and mountains. They yield nothing but scanty oat crops\r\nand potatoes, and though the seas are full of fish as ever, there\r\nare no hands to catch them. _The change is a singular commentary upon\r\nmodern improvements_.' There were many branches belonging to the four\r\nsepts, continues the credulous reporter, who was evidently imposed\r\nupon, like many of his countrymen in modern times with better means\r\nof information. For example, 'there was the branch of Gogath, the\r\nglutton, of which one man would eat half a sheep at a sitting. There\r\nwas another called the Carrow, a gambler, who generally went about\r\nnaked, carrying dice and cards, and he would play the hair off his\r\nhead. Then there was a set of women called Goyng women, blasphemers\r\nof God, who ran from country to country, sowing sedition among the\r\npeople.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude's History, of England, vol. viii. chap. vii.]\r\n\r\nMr. Froude says that this 'picture of Ireland' was given by some\r\nhalf Anglicised, half Protestantised Celt, who wrote what he had seen\r\naround him, careless of political philosophy, or of fine phrases with\r\nwhich to embellish his diction. But if he was a Celt, I think his\r\ndescription clearly proves that he must have been a Celt of some\r\nother country than the one upon whose state he reports. Judging from\r\ninternal evidence, I should say that he could not be a native; for an\r\nIrishman, even though a convert to Anglicanism, and anxious to please\r\nhis new masters, could scarcely betray so much ignorance of the\r\nhistory of his country, so much bigotry, such a want of candour and\r\ndiscrimination. If Mr. Froude's great work has any fault, it is his\r\nunconscious prejudice against Ireland. He knows as well as anyone the\r\nworking of the feudal system and the clan system in Scotland in\r\nthe same age. He knows with what treachery and cruelty murders\r\nwere perpetrated by chiefs and lairds, pretenders and usurpers--how\r\nanarchy, violence, and barbarism reigned in that land; yet, when he is\r\ndealing with a similar state of things in Ireland, he uniformly takes\r\nit as proof of an incurable national idiosyncrasy, and too often\r\ngeneralises from a few cases. For example, in speaking of Shane\r\nO'Neill, who killed his half-brother, Matthew Kelly, Baron of\r\nDungannon, in order to secure the succession for himself, he\r\nsays--'_They manage things strangely in Ireland._ The old O'Neill,\r\ninstead of being irritated, saw in this exploit a proof of commendable\r\nenergy. He at once took Shane into favour, and, had he been able,\r\nwould have given him his dead brother's rights.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE RULE OF THE O'NEILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nShane O'Neill was a man of extraordinary ability and tremendous\r\nenergy, as the English found to their cost. He was guilty of atrocious\r\ndeeds; but he had too many examples in those lawless times encouraging\r\nhim to sacrifice the most sacred ties to his ambition. He resolved to\r\nseize the chieftainship by deposing his father and banishing him to\r\nthe Pale, where, after passing some years in captivity, he died. He\r\nwas, no doubt, urged to do this, lest by some chance the son of the\r\nbaron of Dungannon should be adopted by England as the rightful heir,\r\nand made Earl of Tyrone. This title he spurned, and proclaimed himself\r\nthe O'Neill, the true representative of the ancient kings of Ulster,\r\nto which office he was elected by his people, taking the usual oath\r\nwith his foot upon the sacred stone. This was an open defiance of\r\nEnglish power, and he prepared to abide the consequences. He thought\r\nthe opportunity a favourable one to recover the supremacy of his\r\nancestors over the O'Donels. He accordingly mustered a numerous army,\r\nand marched into Tyrconnel, where he was joined by Hugh O'Donel,\r\nbrother of Calvagh, the chief, with other disaffected persons of the\r\nsame clan. O'Donel had recourse to stratagem. Having caused his cattle\r\nto be driven out of harm's way, he sent a spy into the enemy's camp,\r\nwho mixed with the soldiers, and returning undiscovered, he undertook\r\nto guide O'Donel's army to O'Neill's tent, which was distinguished by\r\na great watch-fire, and guarded by six galloglasses on one side and as\r\nmany Scots on the other. The camp, however, was taken by surprise\r\nin the dead of night, and O'Neill's forces, careless or asleep, were\r\nslaughtered and routed without resistance. Shane himself fled for his\r\nlife, and, swimming across three rivers, succeeded in reaching his own\r\nterritory. This occurred the year before he cast off his allegiance\r\nto England. He was required to appear before Elizabeth in person to\r\nexplain the grounds on which he had claimed the chieftainship. He\r\nconsented, on condition that he got a safe-conduct and money for the\r\nexpenses of his journey. At the same time he sent a long letter to the\r\nQueen, complaining of the treatment he had received, and defending his\r\npretensions. The letter is characteristic of the man and of the times.\r\nHe said: 'The deputy has much ill-used me, your Majesty; and now that\r\nI am going over to see you, I hope you will consider that I am but\r\nrude and uncivil, and do not know my duty to your Highness, nor yet\r\nyour Majesty's laws, but am one brought up in wildness, far from all\r\ncivility. Yet have I a good will to the commonwealth of my country;\r\nand please your Majesty to send over two commissioners that you can\r\ntrust, that will take no bribes, nor otherwise be imposed on, to\r\nobserve what I have done to improve the country, and hear what my\r\naccusers have to say; and then let them go into the Pale, and hear\r\nwhat the people say of your soldiers, with their horses, and their\r\ndogs, and their concubines. Within this year and a half, three hundred\r\nfarmers are come from the English Pale to live in my country, where\r\nthey can be safe.\r\n\r\n'Please your Majesty, your Majesty's money here is not so good as your\r\nmoney in England, and will not pass current there. Please your Majesty\r\nto send me three thousand pounds in English money to pay my expenses\r\nin going over to you, and when I come back I will pay your deputy\r\nthree thousand pounds Irish, such as you are pleased to have current\r\nhere. Also I will ask your Majesty to marry me to some gentlewoman of\r\nnoble blood meet for my vocation. I will make Ireland all that your\r\nMajesty wishes for you. I am very sorry your Majesty is put to such\r\nexpense. If you will trust it to me, I will undertake that in three\r\nyears you will have a revenue, where now you have continual loss.'\r\n\r\nShane suspected evil designs on the part of the English, and not\r\nwithout reason. The object of the summons to England was to detain him\r\nthere with 'gentle talk' till Sussex could return to his command with\r\nan English army powerful enough to subjugate Ulster. For this purpose\r\nsuch preparations were made by the English Government in men and\r\nmoney, 'that rebellion should have no chance; and,' says Mr. Froude,\r\n'so careful was the secresy which was observed, to prevent Shane from\r\ntaking alarm, that a detachment of troops sent from Portsmouth sailed\r\nwith sealed orders, and neither men nor officers knew that Ireland was\r\ntheir destination till they had rounded the Land's End.' The English\r\nplans were well laid. Kildare, whom Elizabeth most feared, had\r\naccepted her invitation to go to London, and thus prevented any\r\nmovement in the south, while O'Donel was prepared to join the English\r\narmy on its advance into Ulster; and the Scots, notwithstanding their\r\npredilection for Mary Stuart, were expected to act as Argyle and his\r\nsister should direct. But Shane had a genius for intrigue as well\r\nas Elizabeth, and he was far more rapid than her generals in the\r\nexecution of his plans. By a master-stroke of policy he disconcerted\r\ntheir arrangements. He had previously asked the Earl of Argyle to give\r\nhim his daughter in marriage, in order that he might strengthen his\r\nalliance with the Ulster Scots. It is true that she had been already\r\nmarried to his rival, O'Donel; but that was a small difficulty in his\r\nway. The knot was tied, but he had no hesitation in cutting it with\r\nhis sword. 'The countess' was well educated for her time. She was also\r\na Protestant, and the government had hopes that her influence would be\r\nfavourable to 'civility and the Reformation' among the barbarians of\r\nthe north. But whatever advantages the presence of the fair Scottish\r\nmissionary might bring, Shane O'Neill did not see why they should\r\nnot be all his own, especially as he had managed somehow to produce\r\na favourable impression on her heart. Accordingly he made a dash\r\ninto Tyrconnel, and carried off both the lady and her husband to his\r\nstronghold, Shane's Castle, on the banks of Lough Neagh. Her Scotch\r\nguard, though fifteen hundred strong, had offered no resistance.\r\nO'Donel was shut up in a prison, and his wife became the willing\r\nparamour of the captor. 'The affront to McConnell was forgiven or\r\natoned for by private arrangement, and the sister of the Earl of\r\nArgyle--an educated woman for her time, not unlearned in Latin,\r\nspeaking French and Italian, counted sober, wise, and no less\r\nsubtle--had betrayed herself and her husband. The O'Neills, by this\r\nlast manoeuvre, became supreme in Ulster. Deprived of their head, the\r\nO'Donels sank into helplessness. The whole force of the province, such\r\nas it was, with the more serious addition of several thousand Scotch\r\nmarauders, was at Shane's disposal, and thus provided, he thought\r\nhimself safe in defying England to do its worst.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, Ibid.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, Sussex had arrived in Dublin preceded by his English forces.\r\nHe made a rapid preliminary movement to the north, and seized the\r\nCathedral of Armagh, in order to make it a fortified depôt for his\r\nstores. He then fell back into Meath, where he was joined by Ormond\r\nwith flying companies of galloglasses. Soon after a singular attack\r\nwas made on the English garrison at Armagh. Seeing a number of kernes\r\nscattered about the town, the officer in command sallied out upon\r\nthem, when O'Neill suddenly appeared, accompanied by the Catholic\r\nArchbishop, on a hill outside the walls. 'The English had but time to\r\nrecover their defences when the whole Irish army, led by a procession\r\nof monks, and every man carrying a fagot, came on to burn the\r\ncathedral over their heads. The monks sang a mass; the primate walked\r\nthree times up and down the lines, willing the rebels to go forward,\r\nfor God was on their side. Shane swore a great oath not to turn his\r\nback while an Englishman was alive; and with scream and yell his men\r\ncame on. _Fortunately there were no Scots among them._ The English,\r\nthough out-numbered ten to one, stood steady in the churchyard, and,\r\nafter a sharp hand-to-hand fight, drove back the howling crowd. The\r\nIrish retired into the friars' houses outside the cathedral close, set\r\nthem on fire, and ran for their lives.'\r\n\r\n'So far,' adds Mr. Froude, 'all was well. After this there was no more\r\ntalk of treating, and by the 18th, Sussex and Ormond were themselves\r\nat Armagh with a force--had there been skill to direct it--sufficient\r\nto have swept Tyrone from border to border.'\r\n\r\nThe English historian exults in the valour of the small garrison of\r\nhis countrymen, well-disciplined and sheltered behind a strong wall,\r\nin resisting the assault of a howling multitude of mere Irish, and he\r\nobserves significantly, that 'fortunately there were no _Scots_ among\r\nthem.' But he is obliged immediately after to record an Irish victory\r\nso signal that, according to the lord deputy himself, 'the fame of the\r\nEnglish army so hardly gotten, was now vanished.' Yet Mr. Froude does\r\nnot, in this, lay the blame of defeat upon the _nationality_ of the\r\nvanquished. It is only the Irish nation that is made the scape-goat in\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\nIt was July, but the weather was wet, the rivers were high, Ormond was\r\nill, Sussex would not leave his friend, and so the English army stayed\r\nin town doing nothing till the end of the month, when their failing\r\nprovisions admonished them that an Irish hosting would be desirable.\r\nO'Neill, who seems to have been aware of the state of things,\r\npresented the appropriate temptation. Spies brought the lord deputy\r\nword that in the direction of Cavan there were herds of cows, which\r\nan active party might easily capture. These spies, with ardent\r\nprofessions of loyalty, offered to guide the English troops to the\r\nplace where the booty would be found, their object being to draw them\r\namong bogs and rivers where they might be destroyed. The lord deputy\r\ndid not think it necessary to accompany this host, which consisted of\r\n200 horse, 500 men-at-arms, and some hundreds of the loyal Irish of\r\nthe Pale. Shane intended to attack them the first night while resting\r\non their march. But they escaped by an alteration of the route. Next\r\nmorning they were marching on the open plain, miles from any shelter\r\nof hill or wood, when the Irish chief, with less than half their\r\nnumber, pursued them, and fell upon the cavalry in the rear, with\r\nthe cry, '_Laundarg Aboo_--the Bloody Hand--Strike for O'Neill!' The\r\nEnglish cavalry commanded by Wingfield, seized with terror, galloped\r\ninto the ranks of their own men-at-arms, rode them down, and\r\nextricated themselves only to fly panic-stricken from the field to the\r\ncrest of an adjoining hill. Meantime, Shane's troopers rode through\r\nthe broken ranks, cutting down the footmen on all sides. The yells and\r\ncries were heard far off through the misty morning air. Fitzwilliam,\r\nwho had the chief command, was about a mile in advance at the head\r\nof another body of cavalry, when a horseman was observed by him,\r\ngalloping wildly in the distance and waving his handkerchief as a\r\nsignal. He returned instantly, followed by his men, and flung himself\r\ninto the _mêleé_. Shane receiving such a charge of those few men, and\r\nseeing more coming after, ran no farther risk, blew a recall note,\r\nand withdrew unpursued. Fitzwilliam's courage alone prevented the army\r\nfrom being annihilated. Out of 500 English 50 lay dead, and 50 more\r\nwere badly wounded. The survivors fell back to Armagh 'so _dismayed_\r\nas to be unfit for farther service.' Pitiable were the lamentations\r\nof the lord deputy to Cecil on this catastrophe. It was, said he, 'by\r\ncowardice the dreadfullest beginning that ever was seen in Ireland.\r\nAh! Mr. Secretary, what unfortunate star hung over me that day to draw\r\nme, that never could be persuaded to be absent from the army at any\r\ntime--to be then absent for a little disease of another man? _The\r\nrearward was the best and picked soldiers in all this land._ If I\r\nor any stout man had been that day with them, we had made an end of\r\nShane--which is now farther off than ever it was. Never before durst\r\nScot or Irishman look on Englishmen in plain or wood since I was here;\r\nand now Shane, in a plain three miles away from any wood, and where I\r\nwould have asked of God to have had him, hath, with 120 horse, and a\r\nfew Scots and galloglasse, _scarce half in numbers_, charged our whole\r\narmy, and by the cowardice of one wretch whom I hold dear to me as\r\nmy own brother, was like in one hour to have left not one man of that\r\narmy alive, and after to have taken me and the rest at Armagh. The\r\nfame of the English army, so hardly gotten, is now vanished, and I,\r\nwretched and dishonoured, by the vileness of other men's deeds.'\r\n\r\nThis is real history that Mr. Froude has given us. It places the\r\nactors before us, enables us to discern their characters, tells us\r\nwho they are and what they have done. It shows also the value and\r\nthe necessity of documentary evidence for establishing the truth\r\nof history. How different from the vague, uncertain, shadowy\r\nrepresentations derived from oral tradition, or mere reports,\r\nthough contemporary, circulated from mouth to mouth, and exaggerated\r\naccording to the interests of one party or the other. Let us for\r\nillustration compare Mr. Froude's vivid picture of this battle, so\r\ndisastrous to the English, with the account given of the same event by\r\nthe Annalists called the Four Masters. These writers had taken great\r\npains to collect the most authentic records of the various Irish\r\ntribes from the invasion by Henry II. to the period of which we\r\nare writing. They were intensely Irish, and of course glad of any\r\nopportunity of recording events creditable to the valour of their\r\ncountrymen. They lived in Donegal, under the protection of O'Donel,\r\nbut they showed themselves quite willing to do full justice to his\r\ngreat rival O'Neill. The presence of the lord deputy, the Earl of\r\nOrmond, and other great men at Armagh, with a select English army,\r\nwould naturally have roused their attention, and when that army was\r\nencountered and vanquished in the open field by the Irish general, we\r\nshould have expected that the details of such a glorious event would\r\nhave been collected with the greatest care from the accounts of\r\neye-witnesses. The bards and historiographers should have been on the\r\nalert to do justice to their country on so great an occasion. They\r\nwere on the spot, they were beside the victors, and they had no excuse\r\nwhatever for ignorance. Yet here is the miserably cold, _jejune_,\r\nfeeble, and imperfect record which we find in the Annals of the Four\r\nMasters:--'The Lord Justice of Ireland, namely Thomas Fitzwalter\r\n(Sussex), marched into Tyrone to take revenge for the capture of\r\nCaloach O'Donel, and also for his own quarrels with the country.\r\nHe encamped with a great army at Armagh, and constructed deep\r\nentrenchments and impregnable ramparts about the great church of\r\nArmagh, which he intended to keep constantly guarded. O'Neill, i.e.\r\nJohn, having received intelligence of this, sent a party of his\r\nfaithful men and friends with Caloach O'Donel to guard and keep\r\nhim from the Lord Justice, and they conveyed him from one island to\r\nanother, in the recesses and sequestered places of Tyrone. After some\r\ntime the Lord Justice sent out from the camp at Armagh, a number of\r\nhis captains with 1000 men to take some prey and plunder in Oriel.\r\nO'Neill, having received private information and intelligence of those\r\ngreat troops marching into Oriel, proceeded privately and silently to\r\nwhere they were, and came up to them after they had collected their\r\nprey; a battle ensued in which many were slain on both sides; and\r\nfinally the preys were abandoned, and fell into the hands of their\r\noriginal possessors on that occasion.'\r\n\r\nThat is the whole account of the most signal victory over the English\r\nthat had crowned the arms of Ulster during those wars! Not a word of\r\nthe disparity of the forces, or the flight of the English cavalry,\r\nor the slaughter of the Englishmen-at-arms, or the humiliation and\r\ndisabled condition of the garrison at Armagh. Equally unsatisfactory\r\nis the record of the subsequent march through Tyrone by Sussex, in the\r\ncourse of which his army slaughtered 4000 head of cattle, which they\r\ncould not drive away. Of this tremendous destruction of property the\r\nFour Masters do not say a word. Such omissions often occur in their\r\nannals, even when dealing with contemporary events. Uncritical as they\r\nwere and extremely credulous, how can we trust the records which they\r\ngive of remote ages?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nO'NEILL, SOVEREIGN OF ULSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moral atmosphere of Elizabeth's court was not favourable to public\r\nvirtue. Strange to say at this time Lord Pembroke seemed to be the\r\nonly nobleman connected with it whose patriotism could be depended on;\r\nand, according to Cecil, there was not another person, 'no not one'\r\nwho did not either wish well to Shane O'Neill, or so ill to the Earl\r\nof Sussex as 'rather to welcome the news than regret the English\r\nloss!' It would be difficult to find 'intriguing factiousness' baser\r\nthan this even in barbarous Ireland. The success of O'Neill, however,\r\nhad raised him high in the opinion of the Queen, who proposed,\r\nthrough the Earl of Kildare, to leave him in possession of all his\r\nterritories, and let him govern the Irish 'according to Irish ideas'\r\nif he would only become her vassal. Sussex had returned to Dublin with\r\nthe remnant of his army, while Fitzwilliam was dispatched to London\r\nto explain the disaster, bearing with him a petition from the Irish\r\nCouncil, that the troops who had been living in free quarters on the\r\ntenants of the Pale should be recalled or disbanded. 'Useless in the\r\nfield and tyrannical to the farmer, they were a burden on the English\r\nexchequer, and answered no purpose but to make the English name\r\ndetested.'\r\n\r\nTo O'Neill the Queen sent a pardon, with a safe conduct to England, if\r\nhe could be prevailed on to go. In the meantime Shane sent a message\r\nto the lord deputy, demanding the removal of the garrison from Armagh.\r\nOne of his messengers, Neill Grey communicated secretly with Lord\r\nSussex, affecting to dislike rebellion, and intimating that he might\r\nhelp the English to get rid of his master. The lord deputy, without\r\nthe least scruple or apparent consciousness of the criminality or\r\ndisgrace of the proceeding, actually proposed to this man that he\r\nshould murder O'Neill. This villanous purpose he avows in his letter\r\nto the Queen. 'In fine,' said he, 'I breake with him to kill Shane;\r\nand bound myself by my oath to see him have a hundred marcs of land by\r\nthe year to him, and to his heirs, for his reward. He seemed desirous\r\nto serve your Highness, and to have the land; but fearful to do it,\r\ndoubting his own escape after with safety, which he confessed and\r\npromised to do by any means he might, escaping with his life. What he\r\nwill do I know not, but I assure your Highness he may do it without\r\ndanger if he will. And if he will not do that he may in your service,\r\nthere will be done _to him_ what others may. God send your Highness a\r\ngood end.'\r\n\r\nThis English nobleman was, it seems, pious as well as honourable,\r\nand could mingle prayers with his plots for assassination. Mr. Froude\r\nsuggests extenuating circumstances: 'Lord Sussex, it appears, regarded\r\nShane as a kind of wolf, whom having failed to capture in fair chase\r\nhe might destroy by the first expedient that came to his hand.' And\r\n'English honour, like English coin, lost something of its purity in\r\nthe sister island.' Of course; it was the Irish atmosphere that did it\r\nall. But Sussex was not singular in this mode of illustrating English\r\nhonour. A greater than he, the chivalrous Sir Walter Raleigh, wrote to\r\na friend in Munster, recommending the treacherous assassination of the\r\nEarl of Desmond, as perfectly justifiable. And this crime, for which\r\nan ignorant Irishman would be hanged, was deliberately suggested by\r\nthe illustrious knight whilst sitting quietly in his English study.[1]\r\nBut what perplexes the historian most of all is that the Queen of\r\nEngland showed no resentment at the infamous proposal of Sussex. 'It\r\nis most sadly certain, however, that Sussex was continued in office,\r\nand inasmuch as it will be seen that he repeated the experiment a few\r\nmonths later, his letter could not have been received with any marked\r\ncondemnation.' Yet Elizabeth was never in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Life of Sir Walter Raleigh.]\r\n\r\nFitzwilliam, however, returned with reinforcements of troops from\r\nBerwick, with which the deputy resolved to repair the credit of the\r\nEnglish arms, and to set the Irish an example of civilised warfare.\r\nHow did he do this? Dispatching provisions by sea to Lough Foyle, he\r\nsucceeded this time in marching through Tyrone, 'and in destroying on\r\nhis way 4,000 cattle, which he was unable to carry away. He had left\r\nShane's cows to rot where he had killed them; and thus being without\r\nfood, and sententiously and characteristically concluding that man by\r\nhis policy might propose, but God at His will did dispose; Lord Sussex\r\nfell back by the upper waters of Lough Erne, sweeping the country\r\nbefore him.' When the Irish peasantry saw the carcasses of their\r\ncattle rotting along the roads, while their children were famished for\r\nwant of milk, they must have been most favourably impressed with the\r\nblessings of British rule! Shane, instead of encountering the deputy\r\non his own territory, amused himself burning villages in Meath.\r\nNeither of those rulers--those chief protectors of the people--seems\r\nto have been conscious that he was doing anything wrong in destroying\r\nthe homes and the food of the wretched inhabitants, whom they\r\nalternately scourged. On the contrary, the extent of devastation which\r\nthey were able to effect was supposed to put them in a better\r\nposition for meeting together, and treating as honourable and gallant\r\nrepresentatives of their respective nations.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the desire of the Queen, Shane, fresh from the work\r\nof destruction in the Pale, was invited to a conference with Kildare.\r\nThey met at Dundalk, and the Irish chief consented to wait upon\r\nElizabeth in London, being allowed to name his own conditions. In\r\ndoing so he implied 'that he was rather conferring a favour than\r\nreceiving one, and that he was going to England as a victorious enemy\r\npermitting himself to be conciliated.' He demanded a safe-conduct so\r\nclearly worded that, whatever was the result of his visit, he should\r\nbe free to return; he required 'a complete amnesty for his past\r\nmisdeeds, and he stipulated that Elizabeth should pay all expenses\r\nfor himself and his retinue; the Earls of Ormond, Desmond, and Kildare\r\nmust receive him in state at Dundalk, and escort him to Dublin;\r\nKildare must accompany him to England; and, most important of all,\r\nArmagh Cathedral must be evacuated. He did not anticipate treachery;\r\nand either he would persuade Elizabeth to recognise him, and thus\r\nprove to the Irish that rebellion was the surest road to prosperity\r\nand power, or, at worst, by venturing into England, and returning\r\nunscathed, he would show them that the Government might be defied with\r\nmore than impunity.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude.]\r\n\r\nThese terms, so humiliating to English pride, were advocated in the\r\nCouncil 'for certain secret respects;' and even Sir William Cecil\r\nwas not ashamed to say, 'that, in Shane's absence from Ireland,'\r\n_something might be cavilled against him or his_, for non-observing\r\nthe covenants on his side; and so the pact being infringed, the\r\nmatter might be used as should be thought fit. With this understanding\r\nElizabeth wrote, making all the ignominious concessions demanded, save\r\none, the evacuation of the cathedral. Shane replied in lofty terms\r\nthat, although for the Earl of Sussex he would not mollify one iota\r\nof his agreement, yet he would consent at the request of her Majesty.\r\n'Thus,' says Mr. Froude, 'with the Earl of Kildare in attendance, a\r\ntrain of galloglasse, 1,000 l. in hand, and a second 1,000 l. awaiting\r\nfor him in London, the champion of Irish freedom sailed from Dublin,\r\nand appeared on the second of January at the English court.'\r\n\r\nIt is stated that Cecil, Pembroke, and Bacon, received him privately\r\non his arrival, instructed him how to behave in the royal presence,\r\ngave him the promised money, and endeavoured to impress upon him the\r\nenormity of his offences. But, to every appeal made to his conscience,\r\nShane answered by a counter appeal about money; 2,000 l. was a poor\r\npresent from so great a Queen; he was sure their honours would\r\ngive him a few more hundreds. He agreed, however, to make a general\r\nconfession of his sins in Irish and English; and, thus tutored,\r\nElizabeth received him in state on January 6, 1562, attended by\r\nthe Council, the peers, the foreign ambassadors, bishops, aldermen,\r\ndignitaries of all kinds, who gazed 'as if at the exhibition of some\r\nwild animal of the desert.' The scene is very graphically described by\r\nMr. Froude: 'O'Neill stalked in, his saffron mantle sweeping round and\r\nround him, his hair curling on his back, and clipped short below\r\nthe eyes, which gleamed from under it with a grey lustre, frowning,\r\nfierce, and cruel. Behind him followed his galloglasse, bare-headed\r\nand fair-haired, with shirts of mail which reached their knees, a\r\nwolf-skin flung across their shoulders, and short broad battle-axes in\r\ntheir hands. At the foot of the throne the chief paused, bent forward,\r\nthrew himself on his face upon the ground, and then, rising upon his\r\nknees, spoke aloud in Irish!' Camden says he 'confessed his crime and\r\nrebellion with howling,' and Mr. Froude adds that, to his hearers, the\r\nsound of the words 'was as the howling of a dog.' He said:--\r\n\r\n'Oh! my most dread sovereign lady and queen, like as I Shane O'Neill,\r\nyour Majesty's subject of your realm of Ireland, have of long time\r\ndesired to come into the presence of your Majesty to acknowledge my\r\nhumble and bounden subjection, so am I now here upon my knees by your\r\ngracious permission, and do most humbly acknowledge your Majesty to be\r\nmy sovereign lady and Queen of England, France, and Ireland; and I\r\ndo confess that, for lack of civil education, I have offended your\r\nMajesty and your laws, for the which I have required and obtained your\r\nMajesty's pardon. And for that I most humbly, from the bottom of my\r\nheart, thank your Majesty, and still do with all humbleness require\r\nthe continuance of the same; and I faithfully promise here before\r\nAlmighty God and your Majesty, and in presence of all these your\r\nnobles, that I intend, by God's grace, to live hereafter in the\r\nobedience of your Majesty as a subject of your land of Ireland.\r\n\r\n'And because this my speech, being Irish, is not well understanded, I\r\nhave caused this my submission to be written in English and Irish, and\r\nthereto have set my hand and seal; and to these gentlemen, my kinsmen\r\nand friends, I most humbly beseech your Majesty to be merciful and\r\ngracious.'\r\n\r\nCamden remarks that the bare-headed galloglasse, with long dishevelled\r\nhair, crocus-dyed shirts, wide sleeves, short jackets, shaggy cloaks,\r\n&c., were objects of great wonder to the Londoners; while the hauteur\r\nof the Irish prince excited the merriment of the courtiers, who styled\r\nhim 'O'Neill the Great, cousin to St. Patrick, friend to the Queen\r\nof England, enemy to all the world besides.' Notwithstanding Shane's\r\nprecautions with respect to the safe-conduct, English artifice outdid\r\nIrish cunning. With all their horror of the Jesuits, Elizabeth's\r\nministers in this case practised mental reservation. True, the\r\nGovernment had promised to permit him to return to Ireland, but then\r\nthe time of his stay had not been specified. Various pretexts were\r\ninvented to detain him. He must be recognised as his father's heir;\r\nthe cause must be pleaded before the English judges; the young Baron\r\nof Dungannon must come over and be heard on the other side. O'Neill\r\nwas told that he had been sent for, while Cecil wrote privately to\r\nFitzwilliam to keep him safe in Ireland. While the prince was thus\r\nhumoured with vain excuses, he was occupied in pleading his own cause\r\nby flattering communications to the Queen, 'whose fame was spoken\r\nof throughout the world.' He wished to study the wisdom of her\r\ngovernment, that he might know better how to order himself in civil\r\npolity. He was most urgent that her Majesty would give him 'some noble\r\nEnglish lady for a wife, with augmentation of living suitable.' If she\r\nwould give him his father's earldom, he would make her the undisputed\r\nsovereign of willing subjects in Ulster; he would drive away all her\r\nenemies, save her from all further expense, and secure for her a\r\ngreat increase of revenue. He begged in the meantime, that he might be\r\nallowed to attend her favourite, Lord Robert Cecil, in order to learn\r\n'to ride after the English fashion, to run at the tilt, to hawk, to\r\nshoot, and use such other good exercises as the said good lord was\r\nmost apt unto.' Thus month after month passed away, and Shane was\r\nstill virtually a prisoner. 'At length,' says Mr. Froude, 'the false\r\ndealing produced its cruel fruit, the murder of the boy who was used\r\nas the pretext for the delay. Sent for to England, yet prevented from\r\nobeying the command, the young Baron of Dungannon was waylaid at the\r\nbeginning of April in a wood near Carlingford by Turlogh O'Neill. He\r\nfled for his life, with the murderers behind him, till he reached\r\nthe bank of a deep river, which he could not swim, and there he was\r\nkilled.'\r\n\r\nThis event brought matters to a crisis, and Shane's cause was\r\ntriumphant. By articles entered into between him and the Queen it was\r\nagreed that he was to be constituted captain or governor of Tyrone 'in\r\nthe same manner as other captains of the said nation called O'Nele's\r\nhad rightfully executed that office in the time of King Henry VIII.\r\nAnd, moreover, he was to enjoy and have the name and title of O'Nele,\r\nwith the like authority as any other of his ancestors, with the\r\nservice and homage of all the lords and captains called _urraughts_,\r\nand other nobles of the said nation of O'Nele.' All this was upon the\r\ncondition 'that he and his said nobles should truly and faithfully,\r\nfrom time to time, serve her Majesty, and, where necessary, wage war\r\nagainst all her enemies in such manner as the Lord Lieutenant for the\r\ntime being should direct.' The title of O'Neill, however, was to be\r\ncontingent on the decision of Parliament as to the validity of the\r\nletters-patent of Henry VIII. Should that decision be unfavourable, he\r\nwas to enjoy his powers and prerogatives under the style and title\r\nof the Earl of Tyrone, with feudal jurisdiction over the northern\r\ncounties. The Pale was to be no shelter to any person whom he might\r\ndemand as a malefactor. If any Irish lord or chief did him wrong, and\r\nthe deputy failed within twenty-one days to exact reparation, Shane\r\nmight raise an army and levy war on his private account. An exception\r\nwas made on behalf of the loyal O'Donel, whose cause was to be\r\nsubmitted to the arbitration of the Irish earls. The 'indenture'\r\nbetween the Queen and O'Neill was signed by the high contracting\r\nparties, and bears date April 30, 1562. The English historian\r\nindignantly remarks: 'A rebel subject treating as an equal with his\r\nsovereign for the terms on which he would remain in his allegiance was\r\nan inglorious spectacle; and the admission of Shane's pretensions to\r\nsovereignty was one more evidence to the small Ulster chiefs that no\r\nservice was worse requited in Ireland than fidelity to the English\r\ncrown. The Maguires, the O'Reillys, the O'Donels--all the clans who\r\nhad stood by Sussex in the preceding summer--were given over to their\r\nenemy bound hand and foot. But Elizabeth was weary of the expense,\r\nand sick of efforts which were profitless as the cultivation of a\r\nquicksand. True it was that she was placing half Ireland in the hands\r\nof an adulterous, murdering scoundrel, but the Irish liked to have it\r\nso, and she forced herself to hope that he would restrain himself for\r\nthe future within the bounds of decency.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude.]\r\n\r\nIn that hope she was soon disappointed. Shane with his galloglasse\r\nreturned in glory, his purse lined with money and honour wreathed\r\nabout his brows. He told the northern chiefs that he had gone to\r\nEngland not to lose but to win, and that they must henceforth submit\r\nto his authority, or feel his power. The O'Donels, relying on English\r\npromises, dared to refuse allegiance to the O'Neill, whereupon,\r\nwithout consulting the lord deputy, 'he called his men to arms and\r\nmarched into Tyrconnel, killing, robbing, and burning in the old style\r\nthrough farm and castle.' The Irish historians, however, make excuses\r\nfor O'Neill, affirming that he was released from his obligations\r\nby the bad faith of the lord deputy. He it was who gave him a safe\r\nconduct to Dublin, that he might take the oath of allegiance according\r\nto promise; but the document was so ingeniously worded that its\r\nmeaning might be twisted so as to make him a prisoner. He was informed\r\nof this treachery, and, as Mr. Froude remarks, 'Shane was too cunning\r\na fish, and had been too lately in the meshes, to be caught again in\r\nso poor a snare.' A most attractive bait was provided by Sussex in\r\nthe person of his sister, who had been brought over to Dublin, and who\r\nmight be won by the great northern chief if he would only come up to\r\nthe viceregal court to woo her. 'Shane glanced at the tempting morsel\r\nwith wistful eyes. Had he trusted himself in the hands of Sussex he\r\nwould have had a short shrift for a blessing and a rough nuptial knot\r\nabout his neck. At the last moment a little bird carried the tale\r\nto his ear. He had been advertized out of the Pale that the lady\r\nwas brought over only to entrap him, and if he came to the deputy he\r\nshould never return.' He therefore excused himself by alleging that\r\nhis duty to the Queen forbade him to leave the province while it was\r\nin such a disturbed condition, the disturbance being caused chiefly by\r\nhis own predatory excursions into the territories of the O'Donels and\r\nMaguires.\r\n\r\nShane took charge of the affairs of the Church as well as of the\r\nState. The Catholic primate refusing to acknowledge Elizabeth as the\r\nhead of the Church, the see was declared vacant, and a _congé d'élire_\r\nwas sent down for the appointment of 'Mr. Adam Loftus,' an Englishman,\r\nwho came over as the lord deputy's chaplain. The answer returned and\r\nreported by Sussex to the Queen was 'that the chapter there, whereof\r\nthe greater part were Shane O'Neill's horsemen, were so sparkled\r\nand out of order that they could by no means be assembled for the\r\nelection. In the meantime the lord deputy began to apprehend that\r\nO'Neill aspired, not without some hope of success, to the sovereignty\r\nof the whole island. It was found that he was in correspondence with\r\nthe Pope, and the Queen of Scots, and the King of Spain. No greater\r\ndanger, wrote Sussex, had ever been in Ireland. He implored the Queen\r\nnot to trifle with it, declaring that he wished some abler general to\r\ntake the command, not from any want of will, 'for he would spend his\r\nlast penny and his last drop of blood for her Majesty.' Right and left\r\nShane was crushing the petty chiefs, who implored the protection\r\nof the Government. Maguire requested the deputy to write to him in\r\nEnglish, not in Latin, because the latter language was well known,\r\nand but few of the Irish had any knowledge of the former, in which\r\ntherefore the secrets of their correspondence would be more safe. Here\r\nis a specimen of his English: 'I know well that within these four days\r\nthe sayed Shan will come to dystroy me contrey except your Lordshypp\r\nwill sette some remedy in the matter.' He did indeed go down into\r\nFermanagh with 'a great hoste.' As Maguire refused to submit, Shane\r\n'bygan to wax mad, and to cawsse his men to bran all his corn and\r\nhowsses.' He spared neither church nor sanctuary; three hundred women\r\nand children were piteously murdered, and Maguire himself, clean\r\nbanished, as he described it, took refuge with the remnant of his\r\npeople in the islands on the lake, whither Shane was making boats to\r\npursue him. 'Help me, your lordship,' the hunted wretch cried, in his\r\ndespair, to Sussex. 'Ye are lyke to make hym the strongest man of all\r\nErlond, for every man wyll take an exampull by the gratte lostys; take\r\nhyd to yourself by thymes, for he is lyke to have all the power from\r\nthis place thill he come to the wallys of Gallway to rysse against\r\nyou.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wright's Elizabeth, vol. i. p.73.]\r\n\r\nIt is the boast of the Irish that when Shane had subdued all his\r\nopponents, he ruled Tyrone for some time with such order, 'that if\r\na robbery was committed within his territory, he either caused the\r\nproperty to be restored, or reimbursed the loser out of his own\r\ntreasury.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Haverty's History of Ireland, p.300.]\r\n\r\nThe perplexity of the Government in this critical emergency is vividly\r\ndescribed by Mr. Froude: 'Elizabeth knew not which way to turn. Force,\r\ntreachery, conciliation had been tried successively, and the Irish\r\nproblem was more hopeless than ever. In the dense darkness of the\r\nprospects of Ulster there was a solitary gleam of light. Grown\r\ninsolent with prosperity, Shane had been dealing too peremptorily with\r\nthe Scots; his countess, though compelled to live with him, and to be\r\nthe mother of his children, had felt his brutality and repented of her\r\nfolly, and perhaps attempted to escape. In the daytime, when he\r\nwas abroad marauding, she was coupled like a hound to a page or a\r\nhorse-boy, and only released at night when he returned to his evening\r\norgies. The fierce Campbells were not men to bear tamely these\r\noutrages from a drunken savage on the sister of their chief, and\r\nSussex conceived that if the Scots, by any contrivance, were separated\r\nfrom Shane, they might be used as a whip to scourge him.'\r\n\r\nAt length Sussex, determined to crush the arch-rebel, marched\r\nnorthward in April, 1563, with a mixed force of English and Irish,\r\nill-armed, ill-supplied, dispirited and almost disloyal. The diary of\r\nthe commander-in-chief is, perhaps, the funniest on record: 'April 6:\r\nThe army arrived at Armagh. April 8: The army marches back to Newry\r\nto bring up stores and ammunition left behind. April 11: The army\r\nadvances again to Armagh, where it waits for galloglasse and kerne\r\nfrom the Pale. April 14: The commander-in-chief answers a letter from\r\nJames M'Connell. April 15: The army goes upon Shane's cattle, of which\r\nit takes enough to serve it, but would have taken more if it had had\r\ngalloglasse.' Next day it returns to Armagh. There it waits three days\r\nfor the galloglasse, and then sends back for them to Dublin. On April\r\n20, again writes M'Connell, because he did not come according to\r\npromise. April 21: The army surveys the Trough mountains. April 22:\r\nThe pious commander winds up the glorious record in these words: 'To\r\nArmagh with the spoil taken which would have been much more if we had\r\nhad galloglasse, and because St. George even forced me, her Majesty's\r\nlieutenant, to return to divine service that night. April 23: Divine\r\nservice.' Subsequently his lordship's extreme piety caused him the\r\nloss of 300 horses, which he naïvely confesses thus: 'Being Easter\r\ntime, and he having travelled the week before, and Easter day till\r\nnight, thought fit to give Easter Monday to prayer, and in this time\r\ncertain churls stole off with the horses.' To this Mr. Froude adds the\r\npertinent remark: 'The piety which could neglect practical duty for\r\nthe outward service of devotion, yet at the same time could make\r\novertures to Neil Greg to assassinate his master, requires no very\r\nlenient consideration.'\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the Irish Church Disestablishment Bill Lord Elcho\r\nproposed Solomon's plan of settling the dispute of the two mother\r\nChurches about Ireland. He would cut the country in two, establishing\r\nProtestantism in the north and Catholicism in the south. When an\r\nexperienced member of the House of Commons makes such a proposition\r\nin this age, we should not be surprised that Sir Thomas Cusack in the\r\nyear 1563 proposed to Queen Elizabeth that Ireland should be divided\r\ninto four provinces, each with a separate president, either elected by\r\nthe people or chosen in compliance with their wishes. O'Neill was to\r\nhave the north, the Clanrickards the west, the O'Briens or Desmonds\r\nthe south, and thus the English might be allowed the undisturbed\r\nenjoyment of the Pale. This notable scheme for settling the Irish\r\nquestion was actually adopted by the Queen, and she wrote to Sussex,\r\nstating that, as his expedition to the north had resulted only in\r\ngiving fresh strength to the enemy, she 'had decided to come to an end\r\nof the war of Ulster by agreement rather than by force.' To Shane she\r\nwas all compliance. He had but to prove himself a good subject, and\r\nhe might have any pre-eminence which her Majesty could grant without\r\ndoing any other person wrong. 'If he desired to have a council\r\nestablished at Armagh, he should himself be the president of that\r\ncouncil; if he wished to drive the Scots out of Antrim, her own troops\r\nwould assist in the expulsion; if he was offended with the garrison in\r\nthe cathedral, she would gladly see peace maintained in a manner less\r\nexpensive to herself. To the primacy he might name the person most\r\nagreeable to himself, and with the primacy, as a matter of course,\r\neven the form of maintaining the Protestant Church would be abandoned\r\nalso. In return for these concessions the Queen demanded only that\r\nShane, to save her honour, should sue for them as a favour instead\r\nof demanding them as a right. The rebel chief consented without\r\ndifficulty to conditions which cost him nothing, and after an\r\ninterview with Cusack, O'Neill wrote a formal apology to Elizabeth,\r\nand promised for the future to be her Majesty's true and faithful\r\nsubject. Indentures were drawn up on December 17, in which the Ulster\r\nsovereignty was transferred to him in everything but the name, and the\r\ntreaty required only Elizabeth's signature, when a second dark effort\r\nwas made to cut the knot of the Irish difficulty.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, vol. viii. p.48.]\r\n\r\nThis second 'dark effort' was nothing less than an attempt to murder\r\nO'Neill by means of poison. He could not be conquered; he could not be\r\nout-manoeuvred; he could not be assassinated in the ordinary way. But\r\nthe resources of Dublin Castle, and of English ingenuity, were\r\nnot exhausted. The lord deputy was of course delighted with the\r\nreconciliation which had been effected with the Ulster prince. What\r\ncould be more natural than to send him a present of the choicest\r\nwine from the viceregal cellars? certainly few presents could be more\r\nagreeable. Shane and his household quaffed the delicious beverage\r\nfreely enough we may be sure, without the slightest suspicion that\r\nthere was death in the cup. But the wine was mingled with poison.\r\nThose who drank it were quickly at the point of death. O'Neill might\r\nthank his good constitution for his recovery from an illness almost\r\nmortal. The crime was traced to an Englishman named Smith, who, if\r\nemployed by Lord Sussex, did not betray the guilty secret. Mr. Froude\r\nadmits that the suspicion cannot but cling to him that this second\r\nattempt at murder was not made without his connivance; 'nor,' he adds,\r\n'can Elizabeth herself be wholly acquitted of responsibility. She\r\nprofessed the loudest indignation, but she ventured no allusion to\r\nhis previous communication with her, and no hint transpires of\r\nany previous displeasure when the proposal had been made openly to\r\nherself. The treachery of an English nobleman, the conduct of\r\nthe inquiry, and the anomalous termination of it, would have been\r\nincredible even in Ireland, were not the original correspondence\r\nextant, in which the facts are not denied.'\r\n\r\nO'Neill of course complained loudly to the Queen, whereupon she\r\ndirected that a strict investigation should take place, in order\r\nthat the guilty parties should be found out and punished, 'of what\r\ncondition soever the same should be.' In writing to the lord deputy\r\nshe assumed that Smith had been committed to prison and would be\r\nbrought to condign punishment. That person, after many denials, at\r\nlength confessed his guilt, and said that his object was to rid his\r\ncountry of a dangerous enemy. This motive was so good in the eye\r\nof the Government that it saved the life of the culprit. Sir Thomas\r\nCusack, writing to Cecil, March 22, 1564, says, 'I persuaded O'Neill\r\nto forget the matter, whereby no more talk should grow of it; seeing\r\nthere is no law to punish the offender other than by discretion and\r\nimprisonment, which O'Neill would little regard except the party might\r\nbe executed by death, and that the law doth not suffer. So as the\r\nmatter be wisely pacified, it were well done to leave it.' Shane was\r\nprobably aware that Smith was but an instrument, who would be readily\r\nsacrificed as a peace-offering.\r\n\r\nThe sketch which Mr. Froude gives of Ulster and its wild sovereign at\r\nthis time is admirably picturesque. 'Here then, for the present,\r\nthe story will leave Shane safely planted on the first step of his\r\nambition, in all but the title, sole monarch of the North. He\r\nbuilt himself a fort on an island in Lough Neagh, which he called\r\n_Foogh-ni-gall_, or, Hate of Englishmen, and grew rich on the spoils\r\nof his enemies, the only strong man in Ireland. He administered\r\njustice after a paternal fashion, permitting no robbers but himself;\r\nwhen wrong was done he compelled restitution, or at his own cost\r\nredeemed the harm \"to the loser's contentation.\" Two hundred pipes of\r\nwine were stored in his cellars; 600 men-at-arms fed at his table, as\r\nit were his janissaries; and daily he feasted the beggars at his gate,\r\nsaying, it was meet to serve Christ first. Half wolf, half fox, he lay\r\ncouched in his Castle of Malepartuis, with his emissaries at Rome, at\r\nParis, and at Edinburgh. In the morning he was the subtle pretender to\r\nthe Irish throne; in the afternoon, when the wine was in him, he was\r\na dissolute savage, revelling in sensuality with his unhappy countess,\r\nuncoupled from her horseboy to wait upon his pleasure. He broke loose\r\nfrom time to time to keep his hand in practice. At Carlingford,\r\nfor example, he swept off one day 200 sheep and oxen, while his\r\nmen violated sixty women in the town; but Elizabeth looked away and\r\nendeavoured not to see. The English Government had resolved to stir no\r\nsleeping dogs in Ireland till a staff was provided to chastise them if\r\nthey would bite. Terence Daniel, the dean of those rough-riding canons\r\nof Armagh, was installed as primate; the Earl of Sussex was recalled\r\nto England; and the new archbishop, unable to contain his exultation\r\nat the blessed day which had dawned upon his country, wrote to Cecil\r\nto say how the millennium had come at last, glory be to God!'\r\n\r\nAs a picture of Irish savage life this is very good. But the historian\r\nhas presented a companion picture of English civilised life, which\r\nis not at all inferior. Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Nicholas Arnold were\r\nsent over to reform the Pale. They were stern Englishmen, impatient\r\nof abuses among their own countrymen, and having no more sympathy for\r\nIrishmen than for wolves. In the Pale they found that peculation had\r\ngrown into a custom; the most barefaced frauds had been converted by\r\nhabit into rights: and a captain's commission was thought ill-handled\r\nif it did not yield, beyond the pay, 500 l. a year. They received pay\r\nfor each hundred men, when only sixty were on the roll. The soldiers,\r\nfollowing the example of their leaders, robbed and ground the\r\npeasantry. In fact, the Pale was 'a weltering sea of corruption--the\r\ncaptains out of credit, the soldiers mutinous, the English Government\r\nhated; every man seeking his own, and none that which was Christ's.'\r\nThe purification of the Pale was left to Arnold, 'a hard, iron,\r\npitiless man, careful of things and careless of phrases, untroubled\r\nwith delicacy, and impervious to Irish enchantments. The account books\r\nwere dragged to light, where iniquity in high places was registered in\r\ninexorable figures. The hands of Sir Henry Ratcliffe, the brother of\r\nSussex, were not found clean. Arnold sent him to the Castle with\r\nthe rest of the offenders. Deep, leading drains were cut through the\r\ncorrupting mass. The shaking ground grew firm, and honest healthy\r\nhuman life was again made possible. With the provinces beyond the\r\nPale, Arnold meddled little, save where, taking a rough view of the\r\nnecessities of the case, he could help the Irish chiefs to destroy\r\neach other.'\r\n\r\nTo Cecil, Arnold wrote thus: 'I am with all the wild Irish at the same\r\npoint I am at with bears and ban-dogs; when I see them fight, so they\r\nfight earnestly indeed, and tug each other well, I care not who has\r\nthe worst.' 'Why not, indeed?' asks Mr. Froude; 'better so than hire\r\nassassins! Cecil, with the modesty of genius, confessed his ignorance\r\nof the country, and his inability to judge; yet, in every opinion\r\nwhich he allowed himself to give, there was always a certain nobility\r\nof tone and sentiment.' Nobility was scarcely necessary to induce\r\na statesman to revolt against the policy of Arnold. A little\r\nChristianity, nay a slight touch of humanity, would have sufficed for\r\nthat purpose. Sussex was a nobleman, and considered himself, no\r\ndoubt, a very godly man, but everyone must admit that, in all heroic\r\nqualities, he was incomparably beneath the uncultured Shane O'Neill,\r\nwhile in baseness and wickedness he was not far behind his northern\r\nfoe, 'half wolf, half fox.' Cecil, however, was a man of a very\r\ndifferent stamp from Sussex. Evidently shocked at the prevailing\r\nEnglish notions about the value of Irish life, he wrote to Arnold:\r\n'You be of that opinion which many wise men are of, from which I do\r\nnot dissent, being an Englishman; but being, as I am, a Christian man,\r\nI am not without some perplexity, to enjoy of such cruelties.'\r\n\r\nThe work of reform, however, did not prove so easy a task. Arnold's\r\nvigour was limited by his powers. The paymasters continued to cheat\r\nthe Government by false returns. The Government allowed the pay to\r\nrun in arrear, the soldiers revenged themselves by oppressing and\r\nplundering the people; and 'so came to pass this wonderful phenomenon,\r\nthat _in O'Neill's country_ alone in Ireland--defended as it was from\r\nattacks from without, and enriched with the plunder of the Pale--_were\r\nthe peasantry prosperous, or life or property secure_.' This fact\r\nmight suggest to the English historian that the evils of Ireland do\r\nnot all proceed from blood or race; and that the Saxon may be placed\r\nin circumstances which make him as false, as dishonest, as lazy, as\r\ndisordered, as worthless as the Celt, and that even men of 'gentle\r\nblood' may become as base as their most plebeian servants. Nor did\r\nzeal for religious reformation redeem the defects of the Anglo-Irish\r\nrulers. The Protestant bishops were chiefly agitated by the vestment\r\ncontroversy. 'Adam Loftus, the titular primate, to whom,' says\r\nMr. Froude, 'sacked villages, ravished women, and famine-stricken\r\nskeletons crawling about the fields, were matters of everyday\r\nindifference, shook with terror at the mention of a surplice.' Robert\r\nDaly wrote in anguish to Cecil, in dismay at the countenance to\r\n'Papistry,' and at his own inability to prolong a persecution which he\r\nhad happily commenced. An abortive 'devise for the better government\r\nof Ireland' gives us some insight into the condition of the people.\r\n'No poor persons should be _compelled_ any more to work or labour\r\nby the day, or otherwise, without meat, drink, wages, or some other\r\nallowance during the time of their labour; no earth tillers, nor any\r\nothers inhabiting a dwelling, under any lord, should be distrained or\r\npunished, in body or goods, for the faults of their landlord; nor\r\nany honest man lose life or lands without fair trial by parliamentary\r\nattainder, according to the ancient laws of England and Ireland.'\r\nSurely it was no proof of incurable perversity of nature, that the\r\nIrish peasantry were discontented and disaffected, under the horrid\r\nsystem of oppression and slavery here laid before the English\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs remedial measures, it was proposed that a true servant of God\r\nshould be placed in every parish, from Cape Clear to the Giant's\r\nCauseway; that the children should be taught the New Testament and the\r\nPsalms in Latin, 'that they, being infants, might savour of the same\r\nin age as an old cask doth;' that there should be a university for the\r\neducation of the clergy, 'and such godly discipline among them that\r\nthere should be no more pluralities, no more abuse of patronage, no\r\nmore neglect, or idleness, or profligacy.' Mr. Froude's reflection\r\nupon this projected policy is highly characteristic:--\r\n\r\n'Here was an ideal Ireland painted on the retina of some worthy\r\nEnglish minister; but the real Ireland was still the old place. As it\r\nwas in the days of Brian Boroihme and the Danes, so it was in the days\r\nof Shane O'Neill and Sir Nicholas Arnold; and the Queen, who was\r\nto found all these fine institutions, cared chiefly to burden her\r\nexchequer no further in the vain effort _to drain the black Irish\r\nmorass_, fed as it was from the perennial fountains of Irish\r\nNATURE.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vol. viii. p.377.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen, however, thought it more prudent to let Shane have his way\r\nin Ulster. To oblige him, she would remove the Protestant primate,\r\nLoftus, to Dublin, and appoint his own nominee and friend, Terence\r\nDaniel. The Pope had sent a third archbishop for the same see,\r\nnamed Creagh; but, when passing through London, he was arrested, and\r\nincarcerated in the Tower, 'where he lay in great misery, cold, and\r\nhunger, without a penny, without the means of getting his single\r\nshirt washed, and without gown or hose.' At last he made his escape\r\nby gliding over the walls into the Thames. The events of 1565 made the\r\nEnglish Government more than ever anxious to come to terms with the\r\nchieftain 'whom they were powerless to crush.' Since the defeat of the\r\nEarl of Sussex, continues Mr. Froude, 'Shane's influence and strength\r\nhad been steadily growing. His return unscathed from London, and the\r\nfierce attitude which he assumed on the instant of his reappearance\r\nin Ulster, convinced the petty leaders that to resist him longer would\r\nonly ensure their ruin. O'Donel was an exile in England, and there\r\nremained unsubdued in the North only the Scottish colonies of Antrim,\r\nwhich were soon to follow with the rest. O'Neill lay quiet through the\r\nwinter. With the spring and the fine weather, when the rivers fell\r\nand the ground dried, he roused himself out of his lair, and with\r\nhis galloglasse and kerne, and a few hundred harquebussmen, he dashed\r\nsuddenly down upon the Red-shanks, and broke them utterly to pieces.\r\nSix or seven hundred were killed in the field, James M'Connell and\r\nhis brother, Sorleyboy, were taken prisoners, and, for the moment, the\r\nwhole colony was swept away. James M'Connell, himself badly wounded\r\nin the action, died a few months later, and Shane was left undisputed\r\nsovereign of Ulster.'\r\n\r\nPrimate Daniel announced to the Queen this 'glorious victory over a\r\nmalicious and dangerous people' who were gradually fastening on the\r\ncountry; and Sir Thomas Cusack urged that now was the time to make\r\nO'Neill a friend for ever, an advice which was backed up by the stern\r\nArnold. 'For what else could be done? The Pale,' he pleaded, 'is poor\r\nand unable to defend itself. If he do fall out before the beginning of\r\nnext summer, there is neither outlaw, rebel, murderer, thief, nor any\r\nlewd nor evil-disposed person--of whom God knoweth there is plenty\r\nswarming in every quarter among the wild Irish, yea and in our own\r\nborder too--which would not join to do what mischief they might.'\r\n\r\nBut Shane did not wait for further royal overtures. He saw that with\r\nthe English Government might was right, and that the justice of his\r\ncause shone out more brightly in proportion to the increase of his\r\npower. Thus encouraged in his course of aggression and conquest, he\r\nseized the Queen's Castles of Newry and Dundrum. He then marched into\r\nConnaught, demanding the tribute due of old time 'to them that were\r\nkings in that realm.' He exacted pledges of obedience from the western\r\nchiefs, and spoiled O'Rourke's country, and returned to Tyrone driving\r\nbefore him 4,000 head of cattle. While proceeding at this rate he\r\nwrote soothing and flattering words to the Queen. It was for her\r\nmajesty he was fighting; he was chastising her enemies and breaking\r\nstiff-necked chiefs into her yoke; and he begged that she would not\r\ncredit any stories which his ill-willers might spread abroad against\r\nhim. On the contrary he hoped she would determine his title and rule\r\nwithout delay, and grant him, in consideration of his good services,\r\nsome augmentation of living in the Pale. Elizabeth, however, excused\r\nhis conduct, saying 'we must allow something for his wild bringing-up,\r\nand not expect from him what we should expect from a perfect subject.\r\nIf he mean well he shall have all his reasonable requests granted.'\r\n\r\nBut there was among Elizabeth's advisers a statesman who felt that\r\nthis sort of policy would never do. Sir Henry Sidney, on being\r\nrequested to take charge of the Government of Ireland, urged the\r\nabsolute necessity of a radical change. The power of O'Neill, and such\r\nrulers as he, must be utterly broken, and that by force, at whatever\r\ncost. And this, he argued, would not only be sound policy but true\r\neconomy. The condition of Ireland was unexampled; free from foreign\r\ninvasion, the sovereignty of the Queen not denied, yet the revenue so\r\nmean and scanty that 'great yearly treasures were carried out of the\r\nrealm of England to satisfy the stipends of the officers and soldiers\r\nrequired for the governance of the same.' He must have 10,000 l.\r\nor 12,000 l. to pay out-standing debts and put the army in proper\r\ncondition. As for his own remuneration, the new viceroy, as he could\r\nexpect nothing from the Queen, would be content with permission to\r\nexport six thousand kerseys and clothes, free of duty.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sidney struck out the only line of policy by which the\r\nEnglish government of Ireland could be made successful or even\r\npossible. He said: 'To go to work by force will be chargeable, it is\r\ntrue; but if you will give the people justice and minister law among\r\nthem, and exercise the sword of the sovereign, and put away the sword\r\nof the subject, _omnia hæc adjicientur vobis_--you shall drive the now\r\nman of war to be an husbandman, and he that now liveth like a lord\r\nto live like a servant, and the money now spent in buying armour, and\r\nhorses, and waging of war, shall be bestowed in building of towns and\r\nhouses. By ending these incessant wars ere they be aware, you shall\r\nbereave them both of force and beggary, and make them weak and\r\nwealthy. Then you can convert the military service due from the lords\r\ninto money; then you can take up the fisheries now left to the French\r\nand the Spaniards; then you can open and work your mines, and the\r\npeople will be able to grant you subsidies.'[1] When the lord deputy\r\narrived in Ireland he found a state of things in the Pale far worse\r\nthan he could have imagined. It was 'as it were overwhelmed with\r\nvagabonds; plunder and spoils daily carried out of it; the people\r\nmiserable; not two gentlemen in the whole of it able to lend 20 l.;\r\nwithout horse, armour, apparel, or victual. The soldiers were worse\r\nthan the people: so beggarlike as it would abhor a general to look on\r\nthem; never a married wife among them, and therefore so allied with\r\nIrishwomen that they betrayed secrets, and could not be trusted on\r\ndangerous service; so insolent as to be intolerable; so rooted in\r\nidleness as there was no hope by correction to amend them.' In Munster\r\na man might ride twenty or thirty miles and find no houses standing\r\nin a country which he had known as well inhabited as many counties in\r\nEngland. 'In Ulster,' Sidney wrote, 'there tyrannizeth the prince of\r\npride; Lucifer was never more puffed up with pride and ambition than\r\nthat O'Neill is; he is at present the only strong and rich man in\r\nIreland, and he is the dangerest man and most like to bring the whole\r\nestate of this land to subversion and subjugation either to him or\r\nto some foreign prince, that ever was in Ireland.' He invited this\r\nLucifer to come into the Pale to see him, and Shane at first agreed to\r\nmeet him at Dundalk, but on second thoughts he politely declined, on\r\nthe ground that the Earl of Sussex had twice attempted to assassinate\r\nhim, and but for the Earl of Kildare would have put a lock upon\r\nhis hands when he was passing through Dublin to England. Hence his\r\n'timorous and mistrustful people' would not trust him any more in\r\nEnglish hands. In fact O'Neill despised any honours the Queen could\r\nconfer upon him. 'When the wine was in him he boasted that he was in\r\nblood and power better than the best of their earls, and he would give\r\nplace to none but his cousin of Kildare, because he was of his own\r\nhouse. They had made a wise earl of M'Carthymore, but Shane kept as\r\ngood a man as he. Whom was he to trust? Sussex gave him a safe-conduct\r\nand then offered him the courtesy of a handlock. The Queen had told\r\nhim herself that, though he had got a safe-conduct to come and go, the\r\ndocument did not say when he was to go; and, in order to get away\r\nfrom London, he was obliged to agree to things against his honour\r\nand profit, and he would never perform them while he lived.' That\r\ntreachery drove him into war. 'My ancestors,' he said, 'were kings\r\nof Ulster; and Ulster is mine, and shall be mine. O'Donel shall\r\nnever come into his country, nor Bagenal into Newry, nor Kildare into\r\nDundrum, or Lecale. They are now mine. With this sword I won them,\r\nwith this sword I will keep them.' Sidney, indignant at these\r\npretensions, wrote thus to Leicester: 'No Atila nor Yotila, no Vandal\r\nnor Goth that ever was, was more to be dreaded for over-running any\r\npart of Christendom, than this man is for over-running and spoiling of\r\nIreland. If it be an angel of heaven that will say that ever O'Neill\r\nwill be a good subject till he be thoroughly chastised, believe him\r\nnot, but think him a spirit of error. Surely if the queen do not\r\nchastise him in Ulster, he will chase all hers out of Ireland. Her\r\nmajesty must make up her mind to the expense, and chastise this\r\ncannibal.' He therefore demanded money that he might pay the garrison\r\nand get rid of the idle, treacherous, incorrigible soldiers which\r\nwere worse than none. Ireland, he said, would be no small loss to the\r\nEnglish crown. It was never so likely to be lost as then, and he would\r\nrather die than that it should be lost during his government. The\r\nqueen, however, sent money with the greatest possible reluctance, and\r\nwas strangely dissatisfied with this able and faithful servant, even\r\nwhen his measures were attended with signal success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Opinions of Sir H. Sidney, Irish MSS., Rolls House;\r\nFroude, p.385.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime O'Neill zealously espoused the cause of Mary Queen of\r\nScots. His friendship with Argyle grew closer, and he proposed that it\r\nshould be cemented by a marriage. 'The countess' was to be sent away,\r\nand Shane was to be united to the widow of James M'Connell, whom he\r\nhad killed--who was another half-sister of Argyle, and whose daughter\r\nhe had married already and divorced. Sidney wrote, that was said to be\r\nthe earl's practice; and Mr. Froude, who has celebrated the virtues\r\nof Henry VIII., takes occasion from this facility of divorce to have\r\nanother fling at 'Irish nature.' He says:--'The Irish chiefs, it\r\nseemed, three thousand years behind the world, retained the habits\r\nand the moralities of the Greek princes in the tale of Troy, when\r\nthe bride of the slaughtered husband was the willing prize of the\r\nconqueror; and when only a rare Andromache was found to envy the fate\r\nof a sister\r\n\r\n    Who had escaped the bed of some victorious lord.'\r\n\r\nAfter a brief and brilliant campaign, in which Shane 'swept round by\r\nLough Erne, swooped on the remaining cattle of Maguire, and struck\r\nterror and admiration into the Irishry,' he wrote a letter to Charles\r\nIX. of France, inviting his co-operation in expelling the heretics,\r\nand bringing back the country to the holy Roman see. The heretic\r\nSaxons, he said, were the enemies of Almighty God, the enemies of the\r\nholy Church of Rome, the King's enemies, and his. 'The time is come\r\nwhen we all are confederates in a common bond to drive the invader\r\nfrom our shores, and we now beseech your Majesty to send us 6,000\r\nwell-armed men. If you will grant our request there will soon be no\r\nEnglishmen left alive among us, and we will be your Majesty's subjects\r\never more.' This letter was intercepted, and is now preserved among\r\nthe Irish MSS.\r\n\r\nSidney resolved to adopt a new plan of warfare. His campaigns would\r\nnot be mere summer forays, mere inroads of devastation during the few\r\ndry weeks of August and September. He would wait till the harvest\r\nwas gathered in, place troops in fortresses, and continue hostilities\r\nthrough the winter. He adopted this course because 'in the cold Irish\r\nsprings, the fields were bare, the cattle were lean, and the weather\r\nwas so uncertain that neither man nor horse could bear it, whereas\r\nin August _food everywhere was abundant_, and the soldiers would have\r\ntime to become hardened to their work.' They could winter somewhere on\r\nthe Bann; harry Tyrone night and day without remission, and so break\r\nShane to the ground and ruin him. There was no time to be lost.\r\nMaguire had come into Dublin, reporting that his last cottage was in\r\nashes, and his last cow driven over the hill into Shane's country;\r\nwhile Argyle, with the whole disposable force of the western isles,\r\nwas expected to join him in summer. O'Neill himself, after an abortive\r\nattempt to entrap Sidney at Dundalk, made a sudden attack on that town\r\nin July; but his men were beaten back, 'and eighteen heads were left\r\nbehind to grin hideously over the gates.' He then returned to Armagh\r\nand burned the cathedral to the ground, to prevent its being again\r\noccupied by an English garrison. He next sent a swift messenger to\r\nDesmond, calling for a rising in Munster. 'Now was the time or never'\r\nto set upon the enemies of Ireland. If Desmond failed, or turned\r\nagainst his country, God would avenge it on him. But Desmond's reply\r\nwas an offer to the deputy 'to go against the rebel with all his\r\npower. The Scots also held back.' Shane offered them all Antrim to\r\njoin him, all the cattle in the country, and the release of Sorleyboy\r\nfrom captivity; but Antrim and its cattle they believed that they\r\ncould recover for themselves, and James M'Connell had left a brother\r\nAllaster, who was watching with eager eyes for an opportunity to\r\nrevenge the death of his kinsman, and the dishonour with which Shane\r\nhad stained his race.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime troops and money came over from England, and on\r\nSeptember 17, Colonel Randolph was at the head of an army in Lough\r\nFoyle; and the lord deputy took the field accompanied by Kildare, the\r\nold O'Donel, Shane Maguire, and O'Dogherty. So that this war against\r\nO'Neill was waged for the dispossessed Irish chiefs as well as for\r\nEngland. Armagh city they found a mere heap of blackened stones.\r\nMarching without obstruction to Ben brook, one of O'Neill's best and\r\nlargest houses, which they found 'utterly burned and razed to the\r\nground,' thence they went on towards Clogher, 'through pleasant\r\nfields, and villages so well inhabited as no Irish county in the realm\r\nwas like it.' The Bishop of Clogher was out with Shane in the field.\r\n'His well-fattened flock were devoured by Sidney's men as by a flight\r\nof Egyptian locusts.' 'There we stayed,' said Sidney, 'to destroy the\r\ncorn; we burned the country for 124 miles compass, and we found by\r\nexperience that now was the time of the year to do the rebel most\r\nharm.' But he says not a word of the harm he was doing to the poor\r\ninnocent peasantry, whose industry had produced the crops, to the\r\nterrified women and children whom he was thus consigning to a horrible\r\nlingering death by famine. This was a strange commencement of his own\r\nprogramme to treat the people with justice.\r\n\r\nThe lord deputy expected to meet Randolph at Lifford; but struck with\r\nthe singular advantages presented by Derry, then an island, for a\r\nmilitary position, he pitched his tents there, and set the troops to\r\nwork in erecting fortifications. Nothing then stood on the site of\r\nthe present city, save a decrepid and deserted monastery of Augustine\r\nmonks, which was said to have been built in the time of St. Columba.\r\n\r\nSidney stayed a few days at Derry, and then, leaving Randolph with\r\n650 men, 350 pioneers, and provisions for two months, he marched on\r\nto Donegal. This was once a thriving town, inhabited by English\r\ncolonists. At the time of Sidney's arrival it was a pile of ruins,\r\n'in the midst of which, like a wild beast's den, strewed round with\r\nmangled bones, rose the largest and strongest castle which he had seen\r\nin Ireland. It was held by one of O'Donel's kinsmen, to whom Shane,\r\nto attach him to his cause, had given his sister to wife. At the\r\nappearance of the old chief with the English army, it was immediately\r\nsurrendered. O'Donel was at last rewarded for his fidelity and\r\nsufferings; and the whole tribe, with eager protestations of\r\nallegiance, gave sureties for their future loyalty.' Sidney next\r\ndirected his march to Ballyshannon, and on by the coast of Sligo.\r\nPassing over the bogs and mountains of Mayo, they came into Roscommon,\r\nand then, 'leaving behind them as fruitful a country as was in\r\nEngland or Ireland all utterly waste,' the army crossed the Shannon at\r\nAthlone, swimming 'for lack of a bridge.' The results of this progress\r\nare thus summed up by Mr. Froude. 'Twenty castles had been taken as\r\nthey went along and left in hands that could be trusted. In all that\r\nlong and painful journey Sidney was able to say that there had not\r\ndied of sickness but three persons; men and horses were brought\r\nback in full health and strength, while her majesty's honour\r\nwas re-established among the Irishry, and grown to no small\r\nveneration--\"an expedition comparable only to Alexander's journey into\r\nBactria,\" wrote an admirer of Sidney to Cecil--revealing what to Irish\r\neyes appeared the magnitude of the difficulty, and forming a measure\r\nof the effect which it produced. The English deputy had bearded Shane\r\nin his stronghold, burned his houses, pillaged his people, and had\r\nfastened a body of police in the midst of them, to keep them waking\r\nin the winter nights. He had penetrated the hitherto impregnable\r\nfortresses of mountain and morass; the Irish who had been faithful to\r\nEngland were again in safe possession of their lands and homes. The\r\nweakest, maddest, and wildest Celts were made aware that, when the\r\nEnglish were once roused to effort, they could crush them as the lion\r\ncrushes the jackal.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vol. viii. p.407.]\r\n\r\nO'Neill had followed the lord deputy to Lifford, and then marched on\r\nto the Pale, expecting to retaliate upon the invaders with impunity.\r\nBut he was encountered by Warren St. Leger, lost 200 men, and was at\r\nfirst hunted back over the border. He again returned, however, with\r\n'a main army,' burned several villages, and in a second fight with St.\r\nLeger, compelled the English to retire, 'for lack of more aid;' but\r\nthey held together in good order, and Shane, with the Derry garrison\r\nin his rear, durst not follow far from home in pursuit. 'Before he\r\ncould revenge himself on Sidney, before he could stir against the\r\nScots, before he could strike a blow at O'Donel, he must pluck out the\r\nbarbed dart which was fastened in his unguarded side.'\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this object, he hovered cautiously about\r\nthe Foyle, watching for an opportunity to attack the garrison. But\r\nRandolph fell upon him by surprise, and after a short sharp action,\r\nthe O'Neills gave way. O'Dogherty with his Irish horse chased the\r\nflying crowd of his countrymen, killing every person he caught; and\r\nShane lost 400 men, the bravest of his warriors. The English success\r\nwas dearly bought, for Randolph leading the pursuit, was struck by a\r\nrandom shot, and fell dead from his horse.\r\n\r\nBefore the Irish chief could recover from this great disaster, Sidney\r\n'struck in again beyond Dundalk, burning his farms and capturing his\r\ncastles. The Scots came in over the Bann, wasting the country all\r\nalong the river side. Allaster M'Connell, like some chief of Sioux\r\nIndians, sent to the captain of Knockfergus an account of the cattle\r\nthat he had driven, and _the wives and bairns_ that he had slain. Like\r\nswarms of angry hornets, these avenging savages drove their stings in\r\nthe now maddened and desperate Shane on every point where they could\r\nfasten; while in December the old O'Donel came out over the mountains\r\nfrom Donegal, and paid back O'Neill with interest for his stolen wife,\r\nhis pillaged country, and his own long imprisonment and exile. The\r\ntide of fortune had turned too late for his own revenge: worn out\r\nwith his long sufferings, he fell from his horse, at the head of his\r\npeople, with the stroke of death upon him; but before he died, he\r\ncalled his kinsmen about him, and prayed them to be true to England\r\nand their queen, and Hugh O'Donel, who succeeded to his father's\r\ncommand, went straight to Derry, and swore allegiance to the English\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n'Tyrone was now smitten in all its borders. Magennis was the last\r\npowerful chief who still adhered to Shane's fortunes; the last week in\r\nthe year Sidney carried fire and sword through his country, and left\r\nhim not a hoof remaining. It was to no purpose that Shane, bewildered\r\nby the rapidity with which disasters were piling themselves upon him,\r\ncried out now for pardon and peace; the deputy would not answer his\r\nletter, and nothing was talked of but his extirpation by war only.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, p.413.]\r\n\r\nThe war, however, was interrupted by a singular calamity that befel\r\nthe Derry garrison. By the death of their commander left 'a headless\r\npeople,' they suffered from want of food and clothing. They also\r\nbecame the prey of a mysterious disease, against which no precautions\r\ncould guard, which no medicine could cure, and by which strong men\r\nwere suddenly struck dead. By the middle of November 'the flux was\r\nreigning among them wonderfully;' many of the best men went away\r\nbecause there was none to stay them. The secret of the dreadful\r\nmalady--something like the cholera--was discovered in the fact that\r\nthe soldiers had built their sleeping quarters over the burial-ground\r\nof the abbey, 'and the clammy vapour had stolen into their lungs and\r\npoisoned them.' The officer who succeeded to the command applied the\r\nmost effectual remedy. He led the men at once into the pure air of the\r\nenemies' country, and they returned after a few days driving before\r\nthem 700 horses and 1,000 cattle. He assured Sidney, that with 300\r\nadditional men, he could so hunt the rebel, that ere May was passed,\r\nhe should not show his face in Ulster. But the 'Black Death' returned\r\nafter a brief respite; and, says Mr. Froude, in the reeking vapour of\r\nthe charnel-house, it was indifferent whether its victims returned in\r\ntriumph from a stricken field, or were cooped within their walls by\r\nhordes of savage enemies. By the middle of March there were left out\r\nof 1,100 but 300 available to fight. Reinforcements had been raised at\r\nLiverpool, but they were countermanded when on the point of sailing.\r\nThe English council was discussing the propriety of removing the\r\ncolony to the Bann, when accident finished the work which the plague\r\nhad begun, and spared them the trouble of deliberation. The huts\r\nand sheds round the monastery had been huddled together for the\r\nconvenience of fortification. At the end of April, probably after\r\na drying east wind, a fire broke out in a blacksmith's forge, which\r\nspread irresistibly through the entire range of buildings. The flames\r\nat last reached the powder magazine: thirty men were blown to pieces\r\nby the explosion, and the rest, paralysed by this last addition\r\nto their misfortunes, made no more effort to extinguish the\r\nconflagration. St. Loo, with all that remained of that ill-fated\r\nparty, watched from their provision boats in the river the utter\r\ndestruction of the settlement which had begun so happily, and then\r\nsailed drearily away to find a refuge in Knockfergus. Such was the\r\nfate of the first efforts for the building of Londonderry; and below\r\nits later glories, as so often happens in this world, lay the bones\r\nof many a hundred gallant men who lost their lives in laying its\r\nfoundations. Elizabeth, who in the immediate pressure of calamity\r\nresumed at once her noble nature, 'perceiving the misfortune not\r\nto come of treason, but of God's ordinance,' bore it well; she was\r\nwilling to do that should be wanting to repair the loss; and Cecil was\r\nable to write cheerfully to Sidney, telling him to make the best of\r\nthe accident and let it stimulate him to fresh exertions.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Page 410.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Shane O'Neill, hard pressed on every side, earnestly\r\nimplored the cardinals of Lorraine and Guise, in the name of their\r\ngreat brother the duke, to bring the _Fleur-de-lys_ to the rescue of\r\nIreland from the grasp of the ungodly English. 'Help us,' he cried,\r\nblending _Irish-like_ flattery with entreaty: 'when I was in England,\r\nI saw your noble brother, the Marquis d'Elboeuf, transfix two stags\r\nwith a single arrow. If the most Christian king will not help us,\r\nmove the pope to help us. I alone in this land sustain his cause.' To\r\npropitiate his holiness, Primate Daniel was dismissed to the ranks\r\nof the army, and Creagh received his crosier, and was taken into\r\nO'Neill's household.\r\n\r\n'All was done,' says the English historian, 'to deserve favour\r\nin earth and heaven, but all was useless. The Pope sat silent or\r\nmuttering his anathemas with bated breath. The Guises had work enough\r\non hand at home to heed the _Irish wolf_, whom the English, having in\r\nvain attempted to trap or poison, were driving to bay with more lawful\r\nweapons.' His own people, divided and dispirited, began now to desert\r\nthe failing cause. In May, by a concerted movement, the deputy with\r\nthe light horse of the Pale overran Tyrone, and robbed the farmers\r\nof 3,000 cattle, while the O'Donels mustered their forces for a great\r\ncontest with Shane, now struggling, almost hopelessly, to maintain\r\nhis supremacy. The O'Neills and O'Donels met on the banks of the Foyle\r\nnear Lifford. The former were superior in number, being about 3,000\r\nmen. After a brief fight 'the O'Neills broke and fled; the enemy was\r\nbehind them, the river was in front; and when the Irish battle cries\r\nhad died away over moor and mountain, but 200 survived of those fierce\r\ntroopers, who were to have cleared Ireland for ever from the presence\r\nof the Saxons. For the rest, the wolves were snarling over their\r\nbodies, and the seagulls whirling over them with scream and cry, as\r\nthey floated down to their last resting-place beneath the quiet waters\r\nof Lough Foyle. Shane's foster-brethren, faithful to the last, were\r\nall killed; he himself with half-a-dozen comrades rode for his life,\r\npursued by the avenging furies. His first desperate intention was to\r\nthrow himself at Sidney's feet, _with a slave's collar upon his neck_;\r\nbut his secretary, Neil M'Kevin, persuaded him that his cause was not\r\nyet absolutely without hope. Sorleyboy was still a prisoner in the\r\ncastle at Lough Neagh, the Countess of Argyle had remained with her\r\nravisher through his shifting fortunes, had continued to bear him\r\nchildren, and notwithstanding his many infidelities, was still\r\nattached to him. M'Kevin told him that for their sakes, or at their\r\nintercession, he might find shelter and perhaps help among the kindred\r\nof the M'Connells.'\r\n\r\nActing on this advice, O'Neill took his prisoner, 'the countess, his\r\nsecretary, and fifty men to the camp of Allaster M'Connell, in the\r\nfar extremity of Antrim. He was received with dissembled gratulatory\r\nwords.' For two days all went on well, and an alliance was talked of.\r\nBut the vengeance of his hosts was with difficulty suppressed. The\r\ngreat chief who was now in their power, had slain their leaders in the\r\nfield, had divorced James M'Connell's daughter, had kept a high-born\r\nScottish lady as his mistress, and had asked Argyle to give him for a\r\nwife M'Connell's widow, who, to escape the dishonour, had remained in\r\nconcealment at Edinburgh. On the third evening, Monday June 2, when\r\nthe wine and the whiskey had gone freely round, and the blood in\r\nShane's veins had warmed, Gilespie M'Connell, who had watched him from\r\nthe first with an ill-boding eye, turned round upon M'Kevin, and asked\r\nscornfully, 'whether it was he who had bruited abroad that the lady\r\nhis aunt did offer to come from Scotland to Ireland to marry with his\r\nmaster?'\r\n\r\nM'Kevin meeting scorn with scorn said, that if his aunt was Queen of\r\nScotland she might be proud to match with the O'Neill. 'It is false,'\r\nthe fierce Scot shouted; 'my aunt is too honest a woman to match with\r\nher husband's murderer.'\r\n\r\n'Shane, who was perhaps drunk, heard the words, and forgetting where\r\nhe was, flung back the lie in Gilespie's throat. Gilespie sprung to\r\nhis feet, ran out of the tent, and raised the slogan of the Isles. A\r\nhundred dirks flashed into the moonlight, and the Irish, wherever they\r\ncould be found, were struck down and stabbed. Some two or three\r\nfound their horses and escaped, all the rest were murdered; and Shane\r\nhimself, gashed with fifty wounds, was wrapped in a kern's old shirt,\r\nand flung into a pit, dug hastily among the ruined arches of Glenarm.\r\nEven there, what was left of him was not allowed to rest. Four days\r\nlater, Piers, the captain of Knockfergus, hacked the head from the\r\nbody, and carried it on a spear's point through Drogheda to Dublin,\r\nwhere, staked upon a pike, it bleached on the battlements of the\r\ncastle, a symbol to the Irish world of the fate of Celtic heroes.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, p.418, &c.]\r\n\r\nMr. Froude might have added: Celtic heroes struck down by Celtic\r\nhands. No lord deputy could boast of a victory over Shane O'Neill\r\nin the field. Irish traitors in English pay, Irish clans moved by\r\nvengeance, did the work of England in the destruction of the great\r\nprincipality of the O'Neills, and it was by _their_ swords, not\r\nby English valour, that Sidney 'recovered Ireland for the crown of\r\nElizabeth.' Whatever may have been the faults of Shane O'Neill, and no\r\ndoubt they were very great, though not to be judged of by the morality\r\nof the nineteenth century, his talents, his force of character, his\r\ncourage and capacity as a general, deserved more favourable notice\r\nfrom Mr. Froude, who, in almost every sentence of his graphic and\r\nsplendid descriptions, betrays an animosity to the Celtic race,\r\nvery strange in an author so enlightened, and evincing, with this\r\nexception, such generous sympathies. After so often reviling the\r\ngreat Irish champion by comparing him to all sorts of wild beasts, the\r\nhistorian thus concludes:--\r\n\r\n'So died Shane O'Neill, one of those champions of Irish nationality,\r\nwho under varying features have repeated themselves in the history of\r\nthat country with periodic regularity. At once a _drunken ruffian_,\r\nand a keen and fiery patriot, the representative in his birth of the\r\nline of the ancient kings, the ideal in his character of all which\r\nIrishmen most admired, regardless in his actions of the laws of God\r\nand man, yet the devoted subject in his creed of the holy Catholic\r\nChurch; with an eye which could see far beyond the limits of his own\r\nisland, and a tongue which could touch the most passionate chords\r\nof the Irish heart; the like of him has been seen many times in that\r\nisland, and the like of him may be seen many times again till the\r\nEthiopian has changed his skin, and the leopard his spots. Numbers of\r\nhis letters remain, to the Queen, to Sussex, to Sidney, to Cecil,\r\nand to foreign princes; far-reaching, full of pleasant flattery and\r\npromises which cost him nothing, but showing true ability and insight.\r\nSinner though he was, he too in his turn was sinned against; in the\r\nstained page of Irish misrule there is no second instance in which\r\nan English ruler stooped to treachery, or to the infamy of attempted\r\nassassination; and it is not to be forgotten that Lord Sussex, who has\r\nleft under his own hand the evidence of his own baseness, continued a\r\ntrusted and favoured councillor of Elizabeth, while Sidney, who fought\r\nShane and conquered him in the open field, found only suspicion and\r\nhard words.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEXTERMINATING WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Froude's magnificent chapter on Ireland, in the eleventh volume\r\nof his history, just published, ought to be studied by every member of\r\nthe legislature before parliament meets. If a nation has a conscience,\r\nEngland must feel remorse for the deeds done in her name in Ireland;\r\nand ought to make amends for them, if possible. The historian has well\r\ndescribed the policy of Queen Elizabeth. She was at times disposed to\r\nforbearance, but 'she made impossible the obedience she enjoined. Her\r\ndeputies and her presidents, too short-sighted to rule with justice,\r\nwere driven to cruelty in spite of themselves. It was easier to kill\r\nthan to restrain. Death was the only gaoler which their finances could\r\nsupport, while the Irish in turn lay in wait to retaliate upon their\r\noppressors, and atrocity begat atrocity in hopeless continuity.'\r\n\r\nWhenever there was a failing in any enterprise, the queen conceived 'a\r\ngreat misliking of the whole matter;' but success covered a multitude\r\nof sins. When the Irish were powerful, and the colony was in danger,\r\nshe thought it 'a hard matter to subvert the customs of the people\r\nwhich they had enjoyed, to be ruled by the captains of their own\r\nnation. Let the chiefs sue for pardon, and submit to her authority,\r\nand she would let them have their seignories, their captaincies, their\r\nbody-guards, and all the rest of their dignities, with power of life\r\nand death over their people. But,' says Mr. Froude, 'it was the curse\r\nof the English rule that it never could adhere consistently to any\r\ndefinite principle. It threatened, and failed to execute its threats.\r\nIt fell back on conciliation, and yet immediately, by some injustice\r\nor cruelty, made reliance on its good faith impossible.'\r\n\r\nEssex seemed to understand well the nature and motive of the queen's\r\nprofessions, and he resolved to make some bold attempts to win back\r\nher favour. He had made a sudden attack on Sir Brian O'Neill of\r\nClandeboye, with troops trained in the wars of the Low Countries, and\r\nin a week he brought him to abject submission, which he expressed by\r\nsaying that 'he had gone wickedly astray, wandering in the wilderness\r\nlike a blind beast.' But it was the misfortune of Sir Brian, or\r\nM'Phelim, that he still held his own territory, which had been\r\ngranted by the queen to Essex. 'The attempt to deprive him had been\r\nrelinquished. He had surrendered his lands, and the queen, at Essex's\r\nown intercession, had reinstated him as tenant under the crown. It\r\nseems, however, as if Essex had his eye still upon the property.'\r\nUnder such circumstances, it was easy to assume that O'Neill was still\r\nplaying false. So he resolved that he should not be able to do so any\r\nlonger. 'He determined to make sure work with so fickle a people.' He\r\nreturned to Clandeboye, as if on a friendly visit. Sir Brian and Lady\r\nO'Neill received him with all hospitality. The Irish Annalists say\r\nthat they gave him a banquet. They not only let him off safe, but they\r\naccompanied him to his castle at Belfast. There he was very gracious.\r\nA high feast was held in the hall; and it was late in the night when\r\nthe noble guest and his wife retired to their lodging outside the\r\nwalls. When they were supposed to be asleep, a company of soldiers\r\nsurrounded the house and prepared to break the door. 'The O'Neills\r\nflew to arms. The cry rang through the village, and the people swarmed\r\nout to defend their chief; but surprised, half-armed, and outnumbered,\r\nthey were overpowered and cut to pieces. Two hundred men were killed.\r\nThe Four Masters add that the women were slain. The chieftain's wife\r\nhad female attendants with her, and no one was knowingly spared. The\r\ntide being out, a squadron of horse was sent at daybreak over the\r\nwater into the \"Ardes,\" from which, in a few hours, they returned with\r\n3,000 of Sir Brian's cattle, and with a drove of stud mares, of which\r\nthe choicest were sent to Fitzwilliam. Sir Brian himself, his brother,\r\nand Lady O'Neill, were carried as prisoners to Dublin, where they were\r\nsoon after executed.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, vol. xi. p.179.]\r\n\r\nEssex did not miscalculate the probable effect of this exploit. It\r\nraised him high in the estimation of the Anglo-Irish of the Pale. 'The\r\ntaint of the country was upon him; he had made himself no better than\r\nthemselves, and was the hero of the hour.' The effect of such conduct\r\nand such a spirit in the rulers, may be imagined. A few weeks later,\r\nSir Edward Fitton wrote: 'I may say of Ireland, that it is quiet;\r\nbut if universal oppression of the mean sort by the great; if murder,\r\nrobberies, burnings make an ill commonwealth, then I cannot say we are\r\nin a good case ... Public sentiment in Dublin, however, was unanimous\r\nin its approbation. Essex was the man who would cauterize the\r\nlong-standing sores. There was a soldier in Ireland at last who\r\nunderstood the work that was to be done, and the way to set about it.\r\nBeloved by the soldiers, admirable alike for religion, nobility, and\r\ncourtesy, altogether the queen's, and not bewitched by the factions\r\nof the realm, the governor of Ulster had but to be armed with supreme\r\npower, and the long-wished-for conquest of Ireland would be easily and\r\ninstantly achieved.'\r\n\r\nThese feelings were not unnatural to the party in Dublin, now\r\nrepresented by the men who recently declared that they rejoiced in\r\nthe election of a Fenian convict in Tipperary, and declared that they\r\nwould vote for such a candidate in preference to a loyal man. But how\r\ndid Queen Elizabeth receive the news of the treacherous and atrocious\r\nmassacre at Belfast? She was not displeased. 'Her occasional\r\ndisapprobation of severities of this kind,' says Mr. Froude, 'was\r\nconfined to cases to which the attention of Europe happened to be\r\nespecially directed. She told Essex that he was a great ornament of\r\nher nobility, she wished she had many as ready as he to spend their\r\nlives for the benefit of their country.'\r\n\r\nThus encouraged by his sovereign, and smarting under the reproach of\r\ncowardice cast on him by Leicester, Essex determined to render his\r\nname illustrious by a still more signal deed of heroism. After an\r\nunprovoked raid on the territories of O'Neill in Tyrone, carrying\r\noff cattle and slaughtering great numbers of innocent people whom\r\nhis soldiers hunted down, he perpetrated another massacre, which is\r\ncertainly one of the most infamous recorded in history. A great\r\nnumber of women and children, aged and sick persons, had fled from the\r\nhorrors that reigned on the mainland, and taken refuge in the island\r\nof Rathlin. The story of their tragic fate is admirably told by Mr.\r\nFroude:--'The situation and the difficulty of access had thus long\r\nmarked Rathlin as a place of refuge for Scotch or Irish fugitives,\r\nand, besides its natural strength, it was respected as a sanctuary,\r\nhaving been the abode at one time of St. Columba. A mass of broken\r\nmasonry, on a cliff overhanging the sea, is a remnant of the castle in\r\nwhich Robert Bruce watched the leap of the legendary spider. To this\r\nisland, when Essex entered Antrim, M'Connell and other Scots had sent\r\ntheir wives and children, their aged and their sick, for safety. On\r\nhis way through Carrickfergus, when returning to Dublin, the earl\r\nascertained that they had not yet been brought back to their homes.\r\nThe officer in command of the English garrison (it is painful to\r\nmention the name either of him, or of any man concerned in what\r\nensued) was John Norris, Lord Norris's second son, so famous\r\nafterwards in the Low Countries, grandson of Sir Henry Norris,\r\nexecuted for adultery with Anne Boleyn. Three small frigates were in\r\nthe harbour. The summer had been hot and windless; the sea was smooth,\r\nthere was a light and favourable air from the east; and Essex directed\r\nNorris to take a company of soldiers with him, cross over, and--'\r\n\r\nWhat? Bring those women and children, those sick and aged folk, back\r\nto their homes? Essex had made peace by treaty with the O'Neill. He\r\nhad killed or chased away every man that could disturb the peace;\r\nand an act of humanity like this would have had a most conciliatory\r\neffect, and ought to recommend the hero to the queen, who should be\r\nsupposed to have the heart as well as the form of a woman.\r\n\r\nNo; the order was, to go over '_and kill whatever he could find!_' Mr.\r\nFroude resumes: 'The run of the Antrim coast was rapidly and quietly\r\naccomplished. Before an alarm could be given, the English had landed,\r\nclose to the ruins of the church which bears St. Columba's name.\r\nBruce's castle was then standing, and was occupied by a score or two\r\nof Scots, who were in charge of the women. But Norris had brought\r\ncannon with him. The weak defences were speedily destroyed, and after\r\na severe assault, in which several of the garrison were killed, the\r\nchief who was in command offered to surrender, if he and his people\r\nwere allowed to return to Scotland. The conditions were rejected. The\r\nScots yielded at discretion, and every living creature in the place,\r\nexcept the chief and his family (who were probably reserved for\r\nransom), was immediately put to the sword. Two hundred were killed in\r\nthe castle. It was then discovered that several hundred more, chiefly\r\nmothers and their little ones, were hidden in the caves about\r\nthe shore. There was no remorse, nor even the faintest shadow of\r\nperception that the occasion called for it. They were hunted out as if\r\nthey had been seals or otters, and all destroyed. Sorleyboy and other\r\nchiefs, Essex coolly wrote, had sent their wives and children into the\r\nisland, \"which be all taken and executed to the number of six hundred.\r\nSorleyboy himself,\" he continued, \"stood upon the mainland of the\r\nGlynnes and saw the taking of the island, and was likely to have run\r\nmad for sorrow, tearing and tormenting himself, and saying that he\r\nthere lost all that he ever had!\" The impression left upon the mind by\r\nthis horrible story, is increased by the composure with which even the\r\nnews of it was received. \"Yellow-haired Charley,\" wrote Essex to\r\nthe queen, \"might tear himself for his pretty little ones and\r\ntheir _dam_,\" but in Ireland itself the massacre was not specially\r\ndistinguished in the general system of atrocity. Essex described it\r\nhimself as one of the exploits with which he was most satisfied; and\r\nElizabeth, in answer to his letters, bade him tell John Norris, \"the\r\nexecutioner of his well-designed enterprise, that she would not be\r\nunmindful of his services.\"'\r\n\r\nI have transcribed this narrative partly for the sake of the\r\nreflection with which Mr. Froude concludes. He says: 'But though\r\npassed over and unheeded at the time, and lying buried for three\r\nhundred years, the bloody stain comes back to the light again, not in\r\nmyth or legend, but in the original account of the nobleman by whose\r\ncommand the deed was done; and when the history of England's dealings\r\nwith Ireland settles at last into its final shape, that hunt among the\r\ncaves at Rathlin will not be forgotten.'[1] It was for services like\r\nthese that Essex got the barony of Farney, in the county Monaghan. He\r\nhad mortgaged his English estates to the queen for 10,000 l.,and after\r\nhis plundering expeditions in Ireland he went home to pay his debts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: History of England, vol. xi. p.184.]\r\n\r\nFurther on Mr. Froude has another reflection connected with the death\r\nof Essex, supposed to have been poisoned, as his widow immediately\r\nafter married Leicester. He says: 'Notwithstanding Rathlin, Essex was\r\none of the noblest of living Englishmen, and that such a man could\r\nhave ordered such a deed, being totally unconscious of the horror of\r\nit, is not the least instructive feature in the dreadful story.' It\r\nis certainly a strange fact that nearly all the official murderers who\r\nruled in Ireland in those times were intensely religious, setting\r\nto their own class a most edifying example of piety. Thus, from the\r\nfirst, Protestantism was presented to the Irish in close connexion\r\nwith brutal inhumanity and remorseless cruelty. Essex, when dying, was\r\ndescribed by the bystanders as acting 'more like a divine preacher or\r\nheavenly prophet than a man.' His opinion of the religious character\r\nof his countrymen was most unfavourable. 'The Gospel had been preached\r\nto them,' he said, 'but they were neither Papists nor Protestants--of\r\nno religion, but full of pride and iniquity. There was nothing but\r\ninfidelity, infidelity, infidelity!--atheism, atheism!--no religion,\r\nno religion!' What such tiger-like slaughterers of women and children,\r\nsuch ruthless destroyers, could have meant by religion is a puzzle for\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nSidney reluctantly resumed the office of viceroy in 1575. Tirlogh\r\nO'Neill congratulated the Government on his appointment, 'wretched\r\nIreland needing not the sword, but sober, temperate, and humane\r\nadministration.' Though it was winter, the new deputy immediately\r\ncommenced a progress through the provinces. Going first to Ulster, he\r\nsaw Sorleyboy, and gave him back Rathlin. He paid a friendly visit\r\nto the O'Neill, who gave him an assurance of his loyalty. Leinster he\r\nfound for the most part 'waste, burnt up and destroyed.' He proceeded\r\nby Waterford to Cork. He was received everywhere with acclamation.\r\n'The wretched people,' says Mr. Froude, how truly!--'sanguine then, as\r\never, in the midst of sorrow, looked on his coming as the inauguration\r\nof a new and happier era.' So, in later times, they looked on the\r\ncoming of Chesterfield, and Fitzwilliam, and Anglesey. But the good\r\nangel was quickly chased away by the evil demon--invoked under the\r\nname of the 'Protestant Interest.' The Munster and the Connaught\r\nchiefs all thronged to Sidney's levées, weary of disaffection, and\r\nwilling to be loyal, if their religion were not interfered with,\r\n'detesting their barbarous lives,'--promising rent and service for\r\ntheir lands. 'The past was wiped out. Confiscation on the one hand,\r\nand rebellion on the other, were to be heard of no more. A clean page\r\nwas turned.' Even the Catholic bishops were tractable, and the viceroy\r\ngot 'good and honest juries in Cork, and with their help twenty-four\r\nmalefactors were honourably condemned and hanged.' Enjoying an ovation\r\nas he passed on to Limerick and Galway, he found many grievances to be\r\nredressed--'plenty of burnings, rapes, murders, besides such spoil\r\nin goods and cattle as in number might be counted infinite, and in\r\nquantity innumerable.'\r\n\r\nSir William Drury was appointed president of Munster; and he was\r\ndetermined that in his case the magistrate should not bear the sword\r\nin vain. Going round the counties as an itinerant judge, he gleaned\r\nthe malefactors Sidney had left, and hanged forty-three of them\r\nin Cork. One he pressed to death for declining to plead to his\r\nindictment. Two M'Sweenys, from Kerry, were drawn and quartered. At\r\nLimerick he hanged forty-two, and at Kilkenny thirty-six, among which\r\nhe said were 'some good ones,' as a sportsman might say, bagging his\r\ngame. He had a difficulty with 'a blackamoor and two witches,' against\r\nwhom he found no statute of the realm, so he dispatched them 'by\r\nnatural law.' Although Jeffreys, at the Bloody Assizes, did not come\r\nnear Drury, the latter found it necessary to apologise to the English\r\nGovernment for the paucity of his victims, saying, 'I have chosen\r\nrather with the snail tenderly to creep, than with the hare swiftly to\r\nrun.' With the Government in Ireland, as Mr. Froude has well remarked,\r\n'the gallows is the only preacher of righteousness.'\r\n\r\nBut the gallows was far too slow, as an instrument of reform and\r\ncivilisation, for Malby, president of Connaught; and as modern\r\nevictors in that province and elsewhere have chosen Christmas as the\r\nmost appropriate season for pulling down dwellings, extinguishing\r\ndomestic fires, and unhousing women and children, so Malby chose the\r\nsame blessed season for his 'improvements' in 1576. It is such a model\r\nfor dealing with the Fenians and tenants on the Tory plan, that I\r\ntranscribe his own report, which Mr. Froude has found among the Irish\r\nMSS. 'At Christmas,' he wrote, 'I marched into their territory, and\r\nfinding courteous dealing with them had like to have cut my throat,\r\nI thought good to take another course; and so with determination _to\r\nconsume them with fire and sword, sparing neither old nor young_,\r\nI entered their mountains. I burnt all their corn and houses, and\r\ncommitted to the sword all that could be found, where were slain\r\nat that time above sixty of their best men, and among them the best\r\nleaders they had. This was Shan Burke's country. Then I burnt Ulick\r\nBurke's country. In like manner I assaulted a castle where the\r\ngarrison surrendered. I put them to the misericordia of my soldiers.\r\nThey were all slain. Thence I went on, sparing none which came in my\r\nway, which cruelty did so amaze their followers, that they could not\r\ntell where to bestow themselves. Shan Burke made means to me to pardon\r\nhim and forbear killing of his people. I would not hearken, but went\r\non my way. The gentlemen of Clanrickard came to me. I found it was but\r\ndallying to win time, so I left Ulick as little corn and as few houses\r\nstanding as I left his brother; and what people was found had as\r\nlittle favour as the other had. _It was all done in rain and frost\r\nand storm_, journeys in such weather bringing them the sooner to\r\nsubmission. They are humble enough now, and will yield to any terms we\r\nlike to offer them.'\r\n\r\nAnd so Malby and his soldiers enjoyed a merry Christmas; and when\r\nWalsingham read his letters, giving an account of his civilising\r\nprogress, to the Queen, she, too, must have enjoyed a fresh sensation,\r\na new pleasure amidst the festivities and gallantries of her brilliant\r\ncourt. Mr. Froude has rendered a timely service in this Christmas\r\ntime to the Coercionists, the Martial Law men, and the Habeas Corpus\r\nSuspension men of our own day. He has shown them their principles at\r\nwork and carried out with a vengeance, and with what results! He has\r\nadmirably sketched the progress of English rule in Ireland up to\r\nthat time--a rule unchanged in principle to the present hour, though\r\nrestrained in its operation by the spirit of the age. Mr. Froude says:\r\n'When the people were quiet, there was the rope for the malefactors,\r\nand death by the natural law for those whom the law written could not\r\ntouch. When they broke out, there was the blazing homestead, and death\r\nby the sword for all, not for the armed kerne only, but for the aged\r\nand infirm, the nursing mother and the baby at her breast. These, with\r\nruined churches, and Irish rogues for ministers,--these, and so far\r\n_only_ these were the symbols of the advance of English rule; yet even\r\nSidney could not order more and more severity, and the president of\r\nMunster was lost in wonder at the detestation with which the English\r\nname was everywhere regarded. Clanrickard was sent to Dublin, and the\r\ndeputy wished to hang him, but he dared not execute an earl without\r\nconsulting his mistress, and Elizabeth's leniency in Ireland, as well\r\nas England, was alive and active towards the great, although it was\r\ndead towards the poor. She could hear without emotion of the massacres\r\nat Rathlin or Slievh Broughty; but the blood of the nobles, who had\r\nbetrayed their wretched followers into the rebellion for which they\r\nsuffered, was for ever precious in her sight. She forbade Sidney to\r\ntouch him.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vol. xi, p.197.]\r\n\r\nNext came the great Desmond Rebellion, by which Munster was desolated.\r\nThe Pope had encouraged an expedition against the heretics in Ireland,\r\nand some Spanish forces joined in the enterprise. It was organised by\r\nan English ecclesiastic, named Sanders, and an exiled Geraldine,\r\nnamed Fitzmaurice of Kerry, both able and energetic men. The Spaniards\r\nlanded at Dingle in 1579. In a few days all Kerry and Limerick were\r\nup, and the woods between Mallow and the Shannon 'were swarming\r\nwith howling kerne.' 'The rebellion,' wrote Waterhouse, 'is the most\r\nperilous that ever began in Ireland. Nothing is to be looked for but a\r\ngeneral revolt.' Malby took the command against them, joined by one of\r\nthe Burkes, Theobald, who when he saw Fitzmaurice struck by a ball\r\nand staggering in his saddle, rode at him and cut him down. The Papal\r\nstandard was unfolded in this battle. Malby then burnt the Desmonds'\r\ncountry, killing all the human beings he met, up to the walls of\r\nAskeaton. When opportunity offered, Desmond retaliated by sacking and\r\nburning Youghal. For two days the Geraldines revelled in plunder; they\r\nviolated the women and murdered all who could not escape. At length\r\nElizabeth was roused to the greatness of the danger, her parsimony\r\nwas overcome. A larger force was drawn into Ireland than had ever\r\nbeen assembled there for a century. Ormond, the hereditary enemy of\r\nDesmond, was appointed commander-in-chief; and Burghley, writing to\r\nhim in the name of the queen, concluded thus: 'So now I will merely\r\nsay, Butler aboo, against all that cry in the new language--Papa aboo,\r\nand God send your hearts' desire to banish and vanquish those cankered\r\nDesmonds!' The war now raged, and, as usual, the innocent people, the\r\ncultivators of the soil, were the first victims. 'We passed through\r\nthe rebel countries,' wrote Pelham, 'in two companies, burning with\r\nfire _all habitations, and executing the people_ wherever we found\r\nthem.' Mr. Froude says: '_Alone_ of all the English commanders he\r\nexpressed remorse at the work.' Well, if the creatures they destroyed\r\nwere horses, dogs, or cats, we should expect a man of ordinary human\r\nfeelings to be shocked at the wholesale butchery. But the beings\r\nslaughtered were men and women and children--Christians found unarmed\r\nand defenceless in their dwellings. Let the English imagine such a\r\nwar carried on in Kent or Yorkshire, by Irish invaders, killing in\r\nthe name of the Pope. The Irish Annalists say that Pelham and Ormond\r\nkilled the blind and the aged, women and children, sick and idiots,\r\nsparing none.\r\n\r\nThe English, as usual, had help from an Irish chief in the work of\r\ndestruction. Ormond had in his train M'Carthymore, 'who, believing\r\nDesmond's day to be done, hoped, by making himself useful, to secure\r\na share of the plunder.' Dividing their forces, Pelham marched on to\r\nDingle, 'destroying as he went, with Ormond parallel to him on the\r\nopposite side of the bay, the two parties watching each other's course\r\nat night across the water by the flames of the burning cottages!'\r\n\r\nThe fleet was waiting at Dingle. There was a merry meeting of the\r\nofficers. 'Here,' says Sir Nicholas White, 'my lord justice and I\r\ngathered cockles for our supper.'[1] The several hunting parties\r\ncompared notes in the evening. Sometimes the sport was bad. On one\r\noccasion Pelham reported that his party had hanged a priest in the\r\nSpanish dress. 'Otherwise,' he says, 'we took small prey, and\r\nkilled less people, though we reached many places in our travel!' At\r\nKillarney they found the lakes full of salmon. In one of the islands\r\nthere was an abbey, in another a parish church, in another a castle,\r\n'out of which there came to them a fair lady, the rejected wife of\r\nLord Fitzmaurice.' Even the soldiers were struck with the singular\r\nloveliness of the scene. 'A fairer land,' one of them said, 'the\r\nsun did never shine upon--pity to see it lying waste in the hands of\r\ntraitors.' Mr. Froude, who deals more justly by the Irish in his last\r\nvolumes, replies: 'Yet it was by those traitors that the woods whose\r\nbeauty they so admired had been planted and fostered. Irish hands,\r\nunaided by English art or English wealth, had built Muckross and\r\nInnisfallen and Aghadoe, and had raised the castles on whose walls the\r\nmodern poet watched the splendour of the sunset.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Carew Papers; Froude, vol. xi. p.225.]\r\n\r\nOrmond was the arch-destroyer of his countrymen. In a report of his\r\nservices he stated that in this one year 1580, he had put to the\r\nsword 'forty-six captains and leaders, with 800 notorious traitors\r\nand malefactors, _and above_ 4,000 other people.'[1] In that year\r\nthe great Desmond wrote to Philip of Spain that he was a homeless\r\nwanderer. 'Every town, castle, village, farm-house belonging to him or\r\nhis people had been destroyed. There was no longer a roof standing in\r\nMunster to shelter him.' Hunted like a wolf through the mountains,\r\nhe was at last found sleeping in a hut and killed. In vain his wife\r\npleaded with Ormond, and threw herself on his protection. Even she was\r\nnot spared. Mr. Froude gives an interesting account of Desmond's last\r\nhours. He was hunted down into the mountains between Tralee and the\r\nAtlantic. M'Sweeny had sheltered him and fed him through the summer,\r\nthough a large price was set on his head; and when M'Sweeny was gone,\r\nkilled by an Irish dagger, the earl's turn could not be distant.\r\nDonell M'Donell Moriarty had been received to grace by Ormond, and\r\nhad promised to deserve his pardon. This man came to the captain\r\nof Castlemayne, gave information of the hiding-place, a band was\r\nsent--half-a-dozen English soldiers and a few Irish kerne, who stole\r\nin the darkness along the path which followed the stream--the door was\r\ndashed in, and the last Earl of Desmond was killed in his bed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Carew Papers; Froude, vol. xi. p.225.]\r\n\r\nOrmond had recourse to a horrible device to extinguish the embers of\r\nthe rebellion. It was carrying out to a diabolical extent the policy\r\nof setting one Irishman against another. If the terror-stricken\r\nwretches hoped for pardon, they must deserve it, by murdering their\r\nrelations. Accordingly sacks full of the heads of reputed rebels were\r\nbrought in daily. Yet concerning him Mr. Froude makes this singular\r\nremark: 'To Ormond the Irish were human beings with human rights. To\r\nthe English they were _vermin, to be cleared from off the earth_ by\r\nany means that offered.'\r\n\r\nConsequently, when it was proposed to make Ormond viceroy, the Pale\r\nwas in a ferment. How could any man be fit to represent English power\r\nin Dublin Castle, who regarded the Irish as human beings! Not less\r\ncurious is the testimony which the historian bears to the character of\r\nthe English exterminators. He says, 'They were honourable, high-minded\r\nmen, full of natural tenderness and gentleness, to every one with whom\r\nthey were placed in _human relations_. The Irish, unfortunately, they\r\nlooked upon as savages who had refused peace and protection when it\r\nwas offered to them, and were now therefore to be _rooted out and\r\ndestroyed_.' A reformer in 1583, however, suggested a milder policy.\r\nHe recommended that 'all Brehons, carraghs, bards, rhymers, friars,\r\nmonks, jesuits, pardoners, nuns, and such-like should be executed by\r\nmartial law, and that with this clean sweep the work of death might\r\nend, and a new era be ushered in with universities and schools, a\r\nfixed police, and agriculture, and good government.'\r\n\r\nWhen the English had destroyed all the houses and churches, burnt all\r\nthe corn, and driven away all the cattle, they were disgusted at the\r\nsavage state in which the remnant of the peasantry lived. A gentleman\r\nnamed Andrew Trollope gave expression to this feeling thus: 'The\r\ncommon people ate flesh if they could steal it, if not they lived on\r\nshamrock and carrion. They never served God or went to church; they\r\nhad no religion and no manners, but were in all things more barbarous\r\nand beast-like than any other people. No governor shall do good here,'\r\nhe said, 'except he show himself a Tamerlane. If hell were open and\r\nall the evil spirits abroad, they could never be worse than these\r\nIrish rogues--rather dogs, and worse than dogs, for dogs do but after\r\ntheir kind, and they degenerate from all humanity.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, vol. xi. p.246.]\r\n\r\nThe population of Ireland was then by slaughter and famine reduced to\r\nabout 600,000, one-eighth of the population of England; but far too\r\nmany, in the estimation of their English rulers. Brabason succeeded\r\nMalby in Connaught, and surpassed him in cruelty. The Four Masters\r\nsay: 'Neither the sanctuary of the saint, neither the wood nor the\r\nforest valley, the town nor the lawn, was a shelter from this captain\r\nand his people, till the whole territory was destroyed by him.' In the\r\nspring of 1582 St. Leger wrote from Cork: 'This country is so ruined\r\nas it is well near unpeopled by the murders and spoils done by the\r\ntraitors on the one side, and by the killing and spoil done by the\r\nsoldiers on the other side, together with the great mortality in town\r\nand country, which is such as the like hath never been seen. There has\r\ndied by famine only not so few as 30,000 in this province in less than\r\nhalf a year, besides others that are hanged and killed.'\r\n\r\nAt length the world began to cry shame on England; and Lord Burghley\r\nwas obliged to admit that the English in Ireland had outdone the\r\nSpaniards in ferocious and blood-thirsty persecution. Remonstrating\r\nwith Sir H. Wallop, ancestor of Lord Portsmouth, he said that the\r\n'Flemings had not such cause to rebel against the oppression of\r\nthe Spaniards, as the Irish against the tyranny of England.' Wallop\r\ndefended the Government; the causes of the rebellion were not to\r\nbe laid at the door of England at all. They were these, 'the great\r\naffection they generally bear to the Popish religion, which agreeth\r\nwith their humour, that having committed murder, incest, thefts, with\r\nall other execrable offences, by hearing a mass, confessing themselves\r\nto a priest, or obtaining the Pope's pardon, they persuade themselves\r\nthat they are forgiven, and, hearing mass on Sunday or holyday, they\r\nthink all the week after they may do what heinous offence soever and\r\nit is dispensed withal.' Trollope said they had no religion. Wallop\r\nsaid they had too much religion. But their nationality was worse than\r\ntheir creed. Wallop adds, 'They also much hate our nation, partly\r\nthrough the general mislike or disdain one nation hath to be governed\r\nby another; partly that we are contrary to them in religion; and\r\nlastly, they seek to have the government among themselves.'\r\n\r\nThe last was the worst of all. Elizabeth wished to heal the wounds of\r\nthe Irish nation by appointing Ormond lord deputy. He was a nobleman\r\nof Norman descent. His family had been true to England for centuries.\r\nHe had commanded her armies during this exterminating war, and, being\r\na native of the country, he would be best fitted to carry on the work\r\nof conciliation after so much slaughter. But, says Mr. Froude, 'from\r\nevery English officer serving in the country, every English settler,\r\nevery bishop of the Anglo-Irish Church, there rose one chorus of\r\nremonstrance and indignation; to them it appeared as a proposal now\r\nwould appear in Calcutta to make the Nizam Viceroy of India.'[1]\r\nWallop wrote that if he were appointed, there would be 'no dwelling in\r\nthe country for any Englishman.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ibid. p.202.]\r\n\r\nThe fear that a merciful policy might be adopted towards Ireland\r\nsorely troubled Wallop and Archbishop Loftus; but they were comforted\r\nby a great prize--an archbishop fell into their hands. Dr. Hurley\r\nrefused to give information against others. Walsingham suggested that\r\nhe should be put to the torture. To him Archbishop Loftus wrote with\r\nunction. 'Not finding that easy method of examination do any good, we\r\nmade command to Mr. Waterhouse and Mr. Secretary Fenton to put him to\r\nthe torture, such as your honour advised us, which was to _toast his\r\nfeet_ against the fire with hot boots.' He confessed something. They\r\nasked permission to execute him by martial law. The queen took a month\r\nto consider. She recommended an ordinary trial for high treason, and\r\nif the jury did not do its duty, they might take the shorter way.\r\nShe wished for no more torture, but 'for what was past her majesty\r\naccepted in good part their careful travail, and greatly commended\r\ntheir doings.' The Irish judges had repeatedly decided that there was\r\nno case against Archbishop Hurley; but on June 19, 1584, Loftus and\r\nWallop wrote to Walsingham, 'We gave warrant to the knight-marshal to\r\ndo execution upon him, which accordingly was performed, and thereby\r\nthe realm rid of a most pestilent member.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Froude, vol. xi. p.264.]\r\n\r\nThis was the last act of these two lords justices. Sir John Perrot,\r\nthe new viceroy, made a speech which sent a ray of hope athwart the\r\nnational gloom. It was simply that the people might thenceforth\r\nexpect a little justice and protection. He told the natives that 'as\r\nnatural-born subjects of her majesty she loved them as her own people.\r\nHe wished to be suppressed and universally abolished throughout the\r\nrealm the name of a churle and the crushing of a churle; affirming\r\nthat, however the former barbarous times had desired it and nourished\r\nit, yet he held it tyrannous both in name and manner, and therefore\r\nwould extirpate it, and use in place of it the titles used in England,\r\nnamely, husbandmen, franklins or yeomen.' 'This was so plausible,'\r\nwrote Sir G. Fenton, 'that it was carried throughout the whole realm,\r\nin less time than might be thought credible, if expressed.'\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of the Munster Geraldines, in the right line,\r\naccording to the theory of the 'Undertakers' and the law of England in\r\ngeneral, vested in the queen the 570,000 acres belonging to the late\r\nearl. Proclamation was accordingly made throughout England, inviting\r\n'younger brothers of good families' to undertake the plantation of\r\nDesmond--each planter to obtain a certain scope of land, on condition\r\nof settling thereupon so many families--'none of the native Irish to\r\nbe admitted' Under these conditions, Sir Christopher Hatton took up\r\n10,000 acres in Waterford; Sir Walter Raleigh 12,000 acres, partly in\r\nWaterford and partly in Cork; Sir William Harbart, or Herbert, 13,000\r\nacres in Kerry; Sir Edward Denny 6,000 in the same county; Sir Warren\r\nSt. Leger, and Sir Thomas Norris, 6,000 acres each in Cork; Sir\r\nWilliam Courtney 10,000 acres in Limerick; Sir Edward Fitton 11,500\r\nacres in Tipperary and Waterford, and Edmund Spenser 3,000 acres in\r\nCork, on the beautiful Blackwater. The other notable Undertakers\r\nwere the Hides, Butchers, Wirths, Berkleys, Trenchards, Thorntons,\r\nBourchers, Billingsleys, &c. Some of these grants, especially\r\nRaleigh's, fell in the next reign to Richard Boyle, the so-called\r\n'_great_ Earl of Cork '--probably the most pious hypocrite to be found\r\nin the long roll of the 'Munster Undertakers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAN IRISH CRUSADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1602, the Lord Deputy Mountjoy, in obedience to instructions from\r\nthe Government in London, marched to the borders of Ulster with\r\na considerable force, to effect, if he could, the arrest of Hugh\r\nO'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, or to bring him to terms. Since the defeat\r\nof the Irish and Spanish confederacy at Kinsale, O'Neill comforted\r\nhimself with the assurance that Philip III. would send another\r\nexpedition to Ireland to retrieve the honour of his flag, and avenge\r\nthe humiliation it had sustained, owing to the incompetency or\r\ntreachery of Don Juan d'Aquila. That the king was inclined to aid the\r\nIrish there can be no question; 'for Clement VIII., then reigning in\r\nthe Vatican, pressed it upon him as a sacred duty, which he owed to\r\nhis co-religionists in Ireland, whose efforts to free themselves from\r\nElizabeth's tyranny, the pontiff pronounced to be a _crusade_ against\r\nthe most implacable heretic of the day.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fate and Fortunes of the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell.\r\nBy the Rev. P.C. Meehan, M.R.I.A.]\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Meehan's authorities may be relied upon, Queen Elizabeth was,\r\nin intention at least, a murderer as well as a heretic. He states\r\nthat while she was gasping on her cushions at Richmond, gazing on the\r\nhaggard features of death, and vainly striving to penetrate the opaque\r\nveil of the future, she commanded Secretary Cecil to charge Mountjoy\r\nto entrap Tyrone into a submission, on diminished rank as Baron of\r\nDungannon, and with lessened territory; or if possible, to have his\r\nhead, before engaging the royal word. It was to accomplish either of\r\nthese objects, that Mountjoy marched to the frontier of the north.\r\n'Among those employed to murder O'Neill in cold blood, were Sir\r\nGeoffry Fenton, Lord Dunsany, and _Henry Oge O'Neill._ Mountjoy bribed\r\none Walker, an Englishman, and a ruffian calling himself Richard\r\nCombus, to make the attempt, but they all failed.'[1] Finding it\r\nimpossible to procure the assassination of 'the sacred person of\r\nO'Neill, who had so many eyes of jealousy about him,' he wrote to\r\nCecil from Drogheda, that nothing prevented Tyrone from making his\r\nsubmission but mistrust of his personal safety and guarantee\r\nfor maintenance commensurate to his princely rank. The lords of\r\nElizabeth's privy council empowered Mountjoy to treat with O'Neill on\r\nthese terms, and to give him the required securities. Sir Garret Moore\r\nand Sir William Godolphin were entrusted with a commission to effect\r\nthis object. But while the lord deputy, with a brilliant retinue,\r\nwas feasting at Mellifont, a monastery bestowed by Henry VIII. on an\r\nancestor of Sir Garret Moore, by whom it was transformed into a 'fair\r\nmansion,' half palace, half fortress, a courier arrived from England,\r\nannouncing the death of the queen. Nevertheless the negotiations\r\nwere pressed on in her name, the fact of her decease being carefully\r\nconcealed from the Irish. Tyrone had already sent his secretary, Henry\r\nO'Hagan, to announce to the lord deputy that he was about to come to\r\nhis presence. Accordingly on March 29, he surrendered himself to the\r\ntwo commissioners at Tougher, within five miles of Dungannon. On the\r\nfollowing evening he reached Mellifont, when, being admitted to the\r\nlord deputy's presence, 'he knelt, as was usual on such occasions;'\r\nand made penitent submission to her majesty. Then, being invited to\r\ncome nearer to the deputy, he repeated the ceremony, if we may credit\r\nFynes Moryson, in the same humiliating attitude, thus:--\r\n\r\n'I, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, do absolutely submit myself to the\r\nqueen's mercy, imploring her gracious commiseration, imploring her\r\nmajesty to mitigate her just indignation against me. I do avow that\r\nthe first motives of my rebellion were neither malice nor ambition;\r\nbut that I was induced by fear of my life, to stand upon my guard. I\r\ndo therefore most humbly sue her majesty, that she will vouchsafe\r\nto restore to me my former dignity and living. In which state of\r\na subject, I vow to continue for ever hereafter loyal, in all true\r\nobedience to her royal person, crown, and prerogatives, and to be\r\nin all things as dutifully conformable thereunto as I or any other\r\nnobleman of this realm is bound by the duty of a subject to his\r\nsovereign, utterly renouncing the name and title of O'Neill, or any\r\nother claim which hath not been granted to me by her majesty. I abjure\r\nall foreign power, and all dependency upon any other potentate but her\r\nmajesty. I renounce all manner of dependency upon the King of Spain,\r\nor treaty with him or any of his confederates, and shall be ready to\r\nserve her majesty against him or any of his forces or confederates.\r\nI do renounce all challenge or intermeddling with the Uriaghts, or\r\nfostering with them or other neighbour lords or gentlemen outside my\r\ncountry, or exacting black-rents of any Uriaghts or bordering lords.\r\nI resign all claim and title to any lands but such as shall now be\r\ngranted to me by her majesty's letters patent. Lastly, I will be\r\ncontent to be advised by her majesty's magistrates here, and will\r\nassist them in anything that may tend to the advancement of her\r\nservice, and the peaceable government of this kingdom, the abolishing\r\nof barbarous customs, the clearing of difficult passes, wherein I will\r\nemploy the labours of the people of my country in such places as I\r\nshall be directed by her majesty, or the lord deputy in her name; and\r\nI will endeavour for myself and the people of my country, to erect\r\ncivil habitations such as shall be of greater effect to preserve us\r\nagainst thieves, and any force but the power of the state.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Life and Letters of Florence M'Carthy. By D.\r\nM'Carthy, Esq.]\r\n\r\nTo this act of submission Tyrone affixed his sign manual, and handed\r\nit to the deputy, who told him he must write to Philip III. of Spain,\r\nto send home his son Henry, who had gone with Father M'Cawell to\r\ncomplete his studies in Salamanca. The deputy also insisted that he\r\nshould reveal all his negotiations with the Spanish court, or any\r\nother foreign sovereign with whom he maintained correspondence; and\r\nwhen the earl assured him that all these requirements should be duly\r\ndischarged, the lord deputy in the queen's name promised him her\r\nmajesty's pardon to himself and followers, to himself the restoration\r\nof his earldom and blood with new letters patent of all his lands,\r\nexcepting the country possessed by Henry Oge O'Neill, and the Fews\r\nbelonging to Tirlough Mac Henry O'Neill, both of whom had recently\r\ntaken grants of their lands, to be holden immediately from the queen.\r\nIt was further covenanted that Tyrone should give 300 acres of his\r\nland to the fort of Charlmont, and 300 more to that of Mountjoy, as\r\nlong as it pleased her majesty to garrison said forts. Tyrone assented\r\nto all these conditions, and then received the accolade from the lord\r\ndeputy, who, a few months before, had written to Queen Elizabeth, that\r\nhe hoped to be able to send her that ghastliest of all trophies--her\r\ngreat rebel's head!\r\n\r\nOn April 4, the lord deputy returned to Dublin accompanied by the\r\ngreat vassal whom he fancied he had bound in inviolable loyalty to the\r\nEnglish throne. To make assurance doubly sure, the day after James was\r\nproclaimed, Tyrone repeated the absolute submission made at Mellifont,\r\nthe name of the sovereign only being changed. He also despatched a\r\nletter to the King of Spain stating that he had held out as long as\r\nhe could, in the vain hope of being succoured by him, and finally when\r\ndeserted by his nearest kinsmen and followers, he was enforced as in\r\nduty bound to declare his allegiance to James I., in whose service and\r\nobedience he meant to live and die.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this act of submission will appear from a manifesto\r\nissued by O'Neill three years before, dated Dungannon, November 16,\r\n1599, and subscribed 'O'Neill.' This remarkable document has been\r\npublished for the first time by Father Meehan.\r\n\r\n'_To the Catholics of the towns in Ireland._\r\n\r\n'Using hitherto more than ordinary favour towards all my countrymen,\r\nwho generally by profession are Catholics, and that naturally I\r\nam inclined to affect [esteem] you, I have for these and other\r\nconsiderations abstained my forces from tempting to do you hindrance,\r\nand because I did expect that you would enter into consideration of\r\nthe lamentable state of our poor country, most tyrannically oppressed,\r\nand of your own gentle consciences, in maintaining, relieving and\r\nhelping the enemies of God and our country in wars infallibly tending\r\nto the promotion of heresy: But now seeing you are so obstinate in\r\nthat which hereunto you continued of necessity, I must use severity\r\nagainst you (whom otherwise I most entirely love) in reclaiming you\r\nby compulsion. My tolerance and happy victories by God's particular\r\nfavour doubtless obtained could work no alteration in your\r\nconsciences, notwithstanding the great calamity and misery, whereunto\r\nyou are most likely to fall by persevering in that damnable state in\r\nwhich hereunto you have lived. Having commiseration on you I thought\r\nit good to forewarn you, requesting every of you to come and join with\r\nme against the enemies of God and our poor country. If the same you do\r\nnot, I will use means to spoil you of all your goods, but according to\r\nthe utmost of my power shall work what I may to dispossess you of\r\nall your lands, because you are the means whereby wars are maintained\r\nagainst the exaltation of the Catholic faith. Contrariwise, whosoever\r\nit shall be that shall join with me, upon my conscience, and as to the\r\ncontrary I shall answer before God, I will employ myself to the utmost\r\nof my power in their defence and for the extirpation of heresy, the\r\nplanting of the Catholic religion, the delivery of our country of\r\ninfinite murders, wicked and detestable policies by which this\r\nkingdom was hitherto governed, nourished in obscurity and ignorance,\r\nmaintained in barbarity and incivility, and consequently of infinite\r\nevils which were too lamentable to be rehearsed. And seeing these are\r\nmotives most laudable before any men of consideration, and before the\r\nAlmighty most meritorious, which is chiefly to be expected, I thought\r\nmyself in conscience bound, seeing God hath given me some power to use\r\nall means for the reduction of this our poor afflicted country into\r\nthe Catholic faith, which can never be brought to any good pass\r\nwithout either your destruction or helping hand; hereby protesting\r\nthat I neither seek your lands or goods, neither do I purpose to plant\r\nany in your places, if you will adjoin with me; but will extend what\r\nliberties and privileges that heretofore you have had if it shall\r\nstand in my power, giving you to understand upon my salvation that\r\nchiefly and principally I fight for the Catholic faith to be planted\r\nthroughout all our poor country, as well in cities as elsewhere,\r\nas manifestly might appear by that I rejected all other conditions\r\nproffered to me this not being granted. I have already by word of\r\nmouth protested, and do now hereby protest, that if I had to be\r\nKing of Ireland without having the Catholic religion which before I\r\nmentioned, I would not the same accept. Take your example by that most\r\nCatholic country, France, whose subjects for defect of Catholic faith\r\ndid go against their most natural king, and maintained wars till he\r\nwas constrained to profess the Catholic religion, duly submitting\r\nhimself to the Apostolic See of Rome, to the which doubtless we may\r\nbring our country, you putting your helping hand with me to the same.\r\nAs for myself I protest before God and upon my salvation I have been\r\nproffered oftentimes such conditions as no man seeking his own private\r\ncommodity could refuse; but I seeking the public utility of my native\r\ncountry will prosecute these wars until that generally religion be\r\nplanted throughout all Ireland. So I rest, praying the Almighty to\r\nmove your flinty hearts to prefer the commodity and profit of our\r\ncountry, before your own private ends.'\r\n\r\nAs a crusader, the O'Neill was a worthy disciple of the King of Spain.\r\nThe Catholics of the south had no wish to engage in a religious\r\nwar, but the northern chief aspiring to the sovereignty of the whole\r\nisland, resolved to reclaim them by compulsion, seeing that\r\nhis tolerance and happy victories had worked no change in their\r\nconsciences, and they still persevered in that 'damnable state'\r\nin which they had lived. From his entire love and commiseration he\r\nforewarned them that if they did not come and join him against the\r\nenemies of God and 'our poor country,' he would not only despoil\r\nthem of all their goods, but dispossess them of all their lands.\r\nThe extirpation of heresy, the planting of the Catholic religion, he\r\ndeclared could never be brought to any good pass without either the\r\ndestruction or the help of the Catholics in the towns of the south and\r\nwest. He did not want their lands or goods, nor did he intend to plant\r\nothers in their places _if they would adjoin with him_. Pointing to\r\nthe example of France, he vowed that he would prosecute those wars\r\nuntil the Catholic religion should be planted throughout all Ireland,\r\npraying that God would move their flinty hearts to join him in this\r\npious and humane enterprise. In those times when religious wars\r\nhad been raging on the continent, when the whole power of Spain was\r\npersistently employed to exterminate Protestants with fire and sword\r\nand every species of cruelty, it is not at all surprising that a\r\nchief like O'Neill, leading such a wild warlike life in Ulster, should\r\npersuade himself that he would be glorifying God and serving his\r\ncountry by destroying the Catholic inhabitants of the towns, that is\r\nall the most civilised portion of the community, because they would\r\nnot join him in robbing and killing the Protestants. But it is not a\r\nlittle surprising that an enlightened, learned, and liberal Catholic\r\npriest, writing in Dublin in the year 1868, should give his deliberate\r\nsanction to this unchristian and barbarous policy. Yet Father Meehan\r\nwrites: 'But no; not even the dint of that manifesto, _with the ring\r\nof true steel in its every line_, could strike a spark out of their\r\nhearts, for they were chalky.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Page 34.]\r\n\r\nIt was very natural that the English Government should act upon the\r\nsame principle of intolerance, especially when they had the plea\r\nof state necessity. They did not yet go the length of exterminating\r\nCatholicity by the means with which the O'Neill threatened his\r\npeaceable and industrious co-religionists in the towns.\r\n\r\nAll they required was that the Catholics should cease to harbour\r\ntheir priests, and that they should attend the Protestant churches.\r\nRemarking upon the proclamation of Chichester to this effect Mr.\r\nMeehan says:--'Apart from the folly of the king, who had taken into\r\nhis head that an entire nation should, at his bidding, apostatise from\r\nthe creed of their forefathers, the publishing such a manifesto\r\nin Dungannon, in Donegal, and elsewhere was a bitter insult to\r\nthe northern chieftains, whose wars were _crusades_,--the natural\r\nconsequence of faith,--stimulated by the Roman Pontiffs, assisted\r\nby Spain, then the most Catholic kingdom in the world.' Does not Mr.\r\nMeehan see that crusading is a game at which two can play? And if\r\nwars which were crusades were the natural consequence of the Catholic\r\nfaith, were stimulated by the Roman Pontiffs, and assisted by Spain,\r\nfor the purpose of destroying the power of England, everywhere as well\r\nas in Ireland, and abolishing the Reformation,--does it not follow\r\nas a necessary consequence that the English Government must in sheer\r\nself-defence have waged a war of extermination against the Catholic\r\nreligion, and have regarded its priests as mortal enemies? No better\r\nplea for the English policy in Ireland was ever offered by any\r\nProtestant writer than this language, intended as a condemnation, by\r\na very able priest in our own day. It was no doubt extreme folly for\r\nKing James I. to expect that a nation, or a single individual, should\r\napostatise at his bidding; but it was equal folly in the King of Spain\r\nto expect Protestants to apostatise at his bidding; and if possible\r\nstill greater folly for O'Neill to expect the Catholic citizens of\r\nMunster to join him in the bloody work of persecution. It was, then,\r\nthe Spanish policy stimulated by the Sovereign Pontiff that was the\r\nstanding excuse of the cruel intolerance and rancorous religious\r\nanimosity which have continued to distract Irish society down to\r\nour own time. Persecution is alien to the Irish race. The malignant\r\n_virus_ imported from Spain poisoned the national blood, maddened the\r\nnational brain, and provoked the terrible system of retaliation that\r\nwas embodied in the Penal Code, and which, surviving to our own time,\r\nstill defends itself by the old plea--the intrusion of a foreign power\r\nattempting to overrule the government of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE IRISH PRINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accession of James I. produced a delirium of joy in the Catholics\r\nof the south. Their bards had sung that the blood of the old Celtic\r\nmonarchs circulated in his veins, their clergy told them that as\r\nJames VI. of Scotland he had received supplies of money from the\r\nRoman court, and above all Clement VIII. then reigning, had sent to\r\ncongratulate him on his accession, having been solicited by him to\r\nfavour his title to the crown of England, which the Pope guaranteed\r\nto do on condition that James promised not to persecute the Catholics.\r\nThe consequence was that the inhabitants of the southern towns rose\r\n_en masse_ without waiting for authority, forced open the gates of the\r\nancient churches, re-erected the altars and used them for the public\r\ncelebration of worship. The lord deputy was startled by intelligence\r\nto this effect from Waterford, Limerick, Cork, Lismore, Kilkenny,\r\nClonmel, Wexford, &c. The cathedrals, churches, and oratories were\r\nseized by the people and clergy, Father White, Vicar-Apostolic of\r\nWaterford, being the leader in this movement, going about from city\r\nto city for the purpose of 'hallowing and purifying' the temples which\r\nProtestantism had desecrated.\r\n\r\nThe mayors of the cities were rebuked by Mountjoy as seditious and\r\nmutinous in setting up 'the public exercise of the Popish religion,'\r\nand he threatened to encamp speedily before Waterford, 'to suppress\r\ninsolences and see peace and obedience maintained.' The deputy kept\r\nhis word, and on May 4, 1603, he appeared before Waterford at the\r\nhead of 5,000 men, officered by Sir R. Wingfield, and others who had\r\ndistinguished themselves during Tyrone's war. 'There is among the\r\nfamily pictures at Powerscourt,' says Mr. Meehan, 'a portrait of this\r\ndistinguished old warrior, whose lineal descendant, the present noble\r\nlord, has always proved most generous to his Catholic tenantry.' The\r\nreverend gentleman gives an amusing sketch of a theological encounter\r\nbetween the old warrior and Father White and a Dominican friar,\r\nwho came forth to the camp under a safe-conduct, both wearing their\r\nclerical habits and preceded by a cross-bearer. The soldiers jeered\r\nat the sacred symbol, and called it an idol. Father White indignantly\r\nresented the outrage, when Sir Richard Wingfield threatened to put\r\nan end to the controversy by running his sword through the\r\nVicar-Apostolic. 'The deputy however was a bookish man, at one period\r\nof his life inclined to Catholicity, and he listened patiently to\r\nFather White on the right of resisting or disobeying the natural\r\nprince; but when the latter quoted some passage thereanent in the\r\nworks of St. Augustine, Mountjoy caused to be brought to him out of\r\nhis tent the identical volume, and showed to the amazement of the\r\nbystanders, that the context explained away all the priest had\r\nasserted.' The noble theologian told Father White that he was a\r\ntraitor, worthy of condign punishment for bringing an idol into a\r\nChristian camp and for opening the churches by the Pope's authority.\r\nFather White appeared in the camp a second time that day, making\r\na most reasonable request. He fell on his knees before the deputy,\r\nbegging liberty of conscience, free and open exercise of religion,\r\nprotesting that the people would be ready to resist all foreign\r\ninvasion were that granted; and finally beseeching that some of the\r\nruined churches might be given to the Catholics, who were ready\r\nto rebuild them, and pay for them a yearly rent into his majesty's\r\nexchequer. But the deputy was inexorable, and all he would grant was\r\nleave to wear clerical clothes, and celebrate mass in private houses.\r\nMountjoy entered Waterford, received from the citizens the oath of\r\nallegiance, and made over the city churches to the small section\r\nof Protestants. At the same time he sent despatches to other towns\r\nordering the authorities to evict the Roman Catholics from the places\r\nof worship. And then proceeding to Cork, and thence through Cashel\r\nto Dublin, he undid all that the clergy had done with respect to the\r\nchurches, 'leaving perhaps to future statesmen,' writes Father\r\nMeehan, 'living above the atmosphere of effete prejudices, the duty of\r\nrestoring to the Catholics of Ireland those grand old temples, which\r\nwere never meant to accommodate a fragment of its people.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Page 30.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mountjoy returned to Dublin he found that he had been created\r\nLord Lieutenant of Ireland with two-thirds of the deputy's allowance,\r\nSir George Carew, appointed deputy during his absence in\r\nEngland, receiving the other third together with his own pay as\r\ntreasurer-at-war. Mountjoy was also informed that the royal pardon had\r\nbeen granted to Tyrone under the great seal, and that all other grants\r\nmade to him by the lord deputy had been confirmed. The king concluded\r\nby requesting that he would induce Tyrone to go with him to London,\r\nadding, 'as we think it very convenient for our service, and require\r\nyou so to do; and if not that at least you bring his son.' Along with\r\nthese instructions came a protection for O'Neill and his retinue. It\r\nwas supposed that James felt grateful to the Ulster chieftain for the\r\nservices he had rendered him during the late queen's reign; and it is\r\nstated by Craik that after the victory of the Blackwater, he sent his\r\nsecretary O'Hagan to Holyrood, to signify to his majesty that if he\r\nsupplied him with money and munitions he would instantly march on\r\nDublin, proclaim him King of Ireland, and set the crown upon his head.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the sovereign's request, Mountjoy, with a brilliant\r\nsuite, accompanied by Tyrone and Rory O'Donel, embarked in May 1603,\r\nand sailed for Holyhead. But when they had sighted the coast of Wales,\r\nthe pinnace was driven back by adverse winds, and nearly wrecked in a\r\nfog at the Skerries. They landed safe, however, at Beaumaris, whence\r\nthey rode rapidly to Chester, where they stopped for the night, and\r\nwere entertained by the mayor. The king's protection for the O'Neill\r\nwas not uncalled for. Whenever he was recognised in city or hamlet,\r\nthe populace, notwithstanding their respect for Mountjoy, the hero of\r\nthe hour, pursued the earl with bitter insults, and stoned him as he\r\npassed along. Throughout the whole journey to London, the Welsh and\r\nEnglish women assailed him with their invectives. Not unnaturally, for\r\n'there was not one among them but could name some friend or kinsman\r\nwhose bones lay buried far away in some wild pass or glen of Ulster,\r\nwhere the object of their maledictions was more often victor than\r\nvanquished.'[1] The king, however, gave the Irish chiefs a gracious\r\nreception, having issued a proclamation that he had restored them to\r\nhis favour, and that they should be 'of all men honourably received.'\r\nThis excited intense disgust amongst English officers who had been\r\nengaged in the Irish wars. Thus Sir John Harrington, writing to\r\na bishop, said: 'I have lived to see that damnable rebel, Tyrone,\r\nbrought to England, honoured and well liked. Oh, what is there that\r\ndoes not prove the inconstancy of worldly matters! How I did labour\r\nafter that knave's destruction! I adventured perils by sea and land,\r\nwas near starving, eat horseflesh in Munster, and all to quell that\r\nman, who now smileth in peace at those who did hazard their lives\r\nto destroy him; and now doeth Tyrone dare us old commanders with his\r\npresence and protection.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Father Meehan.]\r\n\r\nIn fact the favour of the king went to an excess fatal to its object,\r\nby conceding powers incompatible with his own sovereignty, leading\r\nto disorders and violence, and exciting jealousy and mortal enmity in\r\nthose who were charged with the government in Ireland. The lords of\r\nthe Privy Council, with the king's consent, gave O'Neill authority for\r\nmartial law, 'to be executed upon any offenders that shall live under\r\nhim, the better to keep them in obedience.' It was ordered that the\r\nking's garrisons should not meddle with him or his people. The king\r\nalso invested O'Donel with all the lands and rights of ancient time\r\nbelonging to his house, excepting abbeys and other spiritual livings,\r\nthe castle and town of Ballyshannon, and 1,000 acres adjoining\r\nthe fishing there. He also received the style and title of Earl\r\nof Tyrconnel, with remainder to his brother Caffar, the heirs male\r\napparent being created Barons of Donegal. He was formally installed\r\nin Christ Church Cathedral on the 29th of September following, in\r\npresence of Archbishop Loftus and a number of high officials. Tyrone,\r\nhowever, was dogged by spies while he was in London, and one\r\nAtkinson swore informations to the effect that he was in the habit\r\nof entertaining a Jesuit named Archer, who was intriguing with the\r\nforeign enemies of England, and who was held by Irish royalists for\r\n'the most bloody and treacherous traitor, who could divert Tyrone\r\nand all the rest from the king, and thrust them again into actual\r\nrebellion.'\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Sir George Carew was pursuing a policy in Ireland\r\nwhich must of necessity involve the north in fresh troubles. In his\r\nletters to England, he complained that the country 'so swarmed with\r\npriests, Jesuits, seminarists, friars, and Romish bishops, that if\r\nspeedy means were not used to free the kingdom of this wicked rabble,\r\nwhich laboured to draw the subjects' hearts from their due obedience\r\nto their prince, much mischief would burst forth in very short time.\r\nFor,' he said, 'there are here so many of this wicked crew, that are\r\nable to disquiet four of the greatest kingdoms in Christendom. It is\r\nhigh time they were banished from hence, and none to receive, or\r\naid, or relieve them. Let the judges and officers be sworn to the\r\nsupremacy; let the lawyers go to the church and show conformity,\r\nor not plead at the bar; and then the rest by degrees will shortly\r\nfollow.'\r\n\r\nCarew was succeeded as deputy by Sir Arthur Chichester, descended\r\nfrom a family of great antiquity in Devon. He had served in Ireland\r\nas governor of Carrickfergus, admiral of Lough Neagh, and commander\r\nof the Fort of Mountjoy. Father Meehan describes him as malignant and\r\ncruel, with a physiognomy repulsive and petrifying; a Puritan of the\r\nmost rigid character, utterly devoid of sympathy, solely bent on his\r\nown aggrandisement, and seeking it through the plunder and persecution\r\nof the Irish chieftains. That is the Irish view of his character. How\r\nfar he deserved it the reader will be able to judge by his acts.\r\nHe was evidently a man of strong will, an able administrator\r\nand organiser; and he set himself at once, and earnestly, to the\r\nestablishment of law and order in the conquered territories of the\r\nIrish princes. He sent justices of assize throughout Munster and\r\nConnaught, reducing the 'countries or regions' into shire-ground,\r\nabolishing cuttings, cosheries, spendings, and other customary\r\nexactions of the chiefs, by which a complete revolution was effected.\r\nHe issued a proclamation, by the king's order, commanding all the\r\nCatholics, under penalties, to assist at the Church of England\r\nservice; proscribing priests, and other ecclesiastical persons\r\nordained by authority from the see of Home; forbidding parents to send\r\ntheir children to seminaries beyond the seas, or to keep as private\r\ntutors other than those licensed by the Protestant archbishop or\r\nbishop. If any priest dared to celebrate mass, he was liable to a fine\r\nof 200 marks, and a year's imprisonment; while to join the _Romish_\r\nChurch was to become a traitor, and to be subject to a like penalty.\r\nChurchwardens were to make a monthly report of persons absent from\r\nchurch, and to whet the zeal of wardens and constables, for each\r\nconviction of offending parties, they were to have a reward of forty\r\nshillings, to be levied out of the recusant's estate and goods.\r\nCatholics might escape these penalties by quitting the country, and\r\ntaking the oath of abjuration, by which they bound themselves to\r\nabjure the land and realm of James, King of England, Scotland, France,\r\nand Ireland, to hasten towards a certain port by the most direct\r\nhighway, to diligently seek a passage, and tarry there but one\r\nflood and ebb. According to one form, quoted by Mr. Meehan, the oath\r\nconcluded thus: 'And, unless I can have it (a passage) in such a\r\nplace, I will go every day into the sea up to my knees, essaying to\r\npass over, so God me help and His holy judgment.'\r\n\r\nThe deputy found some difficulty in bending the consciences of the\r\nDublin people to the will of the sovereign in matters of faith; but\r\nthe said will was to be enforced _circa sacra_ at all hazards; so he\r\nsummoned sixteen of the chief citizens and aldermen before the Privy\r\nCouncil, and censured them for their recusancy, imprisoned them in the\r\ncastle during pleasure, inflicting upon six a fine of 100 l. each, and\r\nupon three 50 l. each. The king was delighted with this evangelical\r\nmethod of extending reformed religion in Ireland. Congratulating his\r\ndeputy, he expressed a hope that many, by such means, would be brought\r\nto conformity in religion, who would hereafter 'give thanks to God for\r\nbeing drawn by so gentle a constraint to their own good.' The 'gentle\r\nconstraint' was imposed in all directions. The Privy Council decreed\r\nthat none but a member of the Church of England could hold any\r\noffice under the Crown. The old Catholic families of the Pale humbly\r\nremonstrated, and their chief men were flung into prison. Sir Patrick\r\nBarnwell, their agent, was sent to London by order of the king, and\r\nwas forthwith committed to the Tower for contempt. Henry Usher, then\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, carried out the system of exclusion in his own\r\ndiocese, which included the territories of Tyrone. All 'Papists' were\r\nforbidden to assist at mass, on pain of forfeiture of their goods and\r\nimprisonment. In a like manner, the Catholic worship was prohibited\r\neven in the residence of the Earl of Tyrconnel. He and Tyrone strongly\r\nremonstrated against this violation of the royal word, that they and\r\ntheir people might have liberty for their worship in private houses.\r\nThe answer was decided. His majesty had made up his mind to disallow\r\nliberty of worship, and his people, whether they liked it or not,\r\nshould repair to their parish churches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this religious grievance, which excited the bitterest\r\nfeelings of discontent, the two earls were subjected to the most\r\nirritating annoyances. They complained that their people were\r\nplundered by sheriffs, under-sheriffs, officers, and soldiers; and\r\nthat even their domestic privacy was hourly violated, that their\r\nremonstrances were unheeded, and their attempts to obtain legal\r\nremedies were frustrated. At the same time their vassals were\r\nencouraged to repudiate their demands for tribute and rent. Bishop\r\nMontgomery of Derry was a dangerous neighbour to O'Neill. Meeting him\r\none day at Dungannon, the earl said: 'My lord, you have two or three\r\nbishopricks, and yet you are not content with them, but seek the lands\r\nof my earldom.'\r\n\r\n'My lord,' replied the bishop, 'your earldom is swollen so big with\r\nthe lands of the Church, that it will burst if it be not vented.' If\r\nhe had confined his venting operations to the chiefs, and abstained\r\nfrom bleeding the poor people, it would have been better for\r\nProtestantism. For we read that he sent bailiffs through the diocese\r\nof Raphoe, to levy contributions for the Church. 'For every cow and\r\nplough-horse, 4 d.; as much out of every colt and calf, to be\r\npaid twice a year; and half-a-crown a quarter of every shoemaker,\r\ncarpenter, smith, and weaver in the whole country; and 8 d. a year for\r\nevery married couple.'\r\n\r\nThis bishop seems to have been greatly impressed with the\r\n'commodities' of O'Cahan's country, which he describes with much\r\nunction in a letter to the Earl of Salisbury. He said that the country\r\nwas 'large, pleasant, and fruitful; twenty-four miles in length\r\nbetween Lough Foyle and the Bann; and in breadth, from the sea-coast\r\ntowards the lower parts of Tyrone, 14 miles.' He states that O'Cahan\r\nwas able to assist the Earl of Tyrone, during his war, with 1,200\r\nfoot and 300 horse, the ablest men that Ulster yielded; and, by the\r\nconfession of gentlemen of the first plantation, had oftener put them\r\nto their defence than any enemy they had to do with, not suffering\r\nthem to cut a bough or build a cabin without blows. When Tyrone was\r\ndriven to his fastness, Glenconkeine, O'Cahan sent him 100 horse and\r\n300 foot, and yet made good his own country against the army lying\r\nround about him, adding, that his defection 'did undo the earl, who,\r\nas he had his country sure behind him, cared little for anything the\r\narmy could do to him.' The bishop was, therefore, very anxious that\r\nTyrone should not have any estate in O'Cahan's country, 'since he was\r\nof great power to offend or benefit the poor infant city of Derry, its\r\nnew bishop and people, cast out far from the heart and head into the\r\nremotest part of Ireland, where life would be unsafe until the whole\r\nregion was well settled with civil subjects. If this be not brought to\r\npass, we may say: \"_fuimus Troes,--fuit Ilium_.\"'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meehan, p.79.]\r\n\r\nThe defection of O'Cahan was, no doubt, a very serious matter to\r\nO'Neill. Their case was referred for adjudication to the lord deputy,\r\nChichester, before whom they personally pleaded. Their contradictory\r\nstatements, and the eagerness of each for the support of a ruler whom\r\nthey regarded as a common enemy, accounts for the facility with which\r\ntheir power was ultimately destroyed. They at the same time throw much\r\nlight on the condition of Ulster before the confiscation of James I.,\r\nproving that it was by no means so poor and wild and barren a region\r\nas it is generally represented by modern writers. The two chiefs had a\r\npersonal altercation at the council table, and O'Neill so far lost his\r\ntemper as to snatch a paper out of the hand of O'Cahan. Whereupon Sir\r\nJohn Davis remarked: 'I rest assured, in my own conceit, that I shall\r\nlive to see Ulster the best reformed province in this kingdom; and\r\nas for yourself, my lord, I hope to live to see you the best reformed\r\nsubject in Ireland.' To this the haughty chief replied with warmth,\r\nthat he hoped 'the attorney-general would never see the day when\r\ninjustice should be done him by transferring his lands to the Crown,\r\nand thence to the bishop, who was intent on converting the whole\r\nterritory into his own pocket.'\r\n\r\nActing under the advice of the bishop, O'Cahan employed a skilful\r\nhand to draw up a statement of his case, which was presented on May 2,\r\n1607, in the form of 'the humble petition of Donald Ballagh O'Cahan,\r\nchief of his name,' addressed to the lord deputy and council. He\r\ndeclared that for 3,000 years and upwards, he and his ancestors had\r\nbeen possessed of a country called 'O'Cahan's country,' lying between\r\nthe river Bann and Lough Foyle, without paying any rent, or other\r\nacknowledgment thereof to O'Neill, saving that his ancestors were wont\r\nto aid O'Neill twice a year if he had need, with risings of 100 horse\r\nand 300 foot, for which O'Cahan had in return O'Neill's whole suit of\r\napparel, the horse that he rode upon, and 100 cows in winter. He also\r\npaid 21 cows every year in the name of _Cios'righ_, the king's rent,\r\nor the king's rent-cess. He alleged that Queen Elizabeth had granted\r\nhim his country to be held immediately from her majesty at the\r\naccustomed rent, by virtue of which he enjoyed it for one whole year\r\nwithout paying, or being craved payment, of any rent or duty, until\r\nthe Earl of Tyrone, on his return from England, alleged that he had\r\ngot O'Cahan's country by patent, from the king, who had made him\r\nvassal to Tyrone and his heirs for ever, imposing the annual payment\r\nof 100 cows, with the yearly rent of 200 l. He had also claimed the\r\nfishing of the Bann; he preyed yearly upon other parts of his country,\r\nand drew from him his best tenants. He therefore prayed for the\r\nprotection of the lord deputy against these unjust demands and\r\nusurpations.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of the same month, O'Neill made a counter statement to the\r\nfollowing effect: O'Cahan had no estate in the territory that was by\r\na corruption of speech called O'Cahan's country; nor did he or any of\r\nhis ancestors ever hold the said lands but as tenants at sufferance,\r\nservants and followers to the defendant and his ancestors. His\r\ngrandfather Con O'Neill was seised in fee of those lands before he\r\nsurrendered to Henry VIII., 'and received yearly, and had thereout,\r\nas much rents, cutting, spending and all other duties as of any other\r\nlands which he had in demesne,' within the province of Ulster and\r\nterritory of Tyrone, and that after Con's surrender the territories\r\nwere all re-granted with the rents, customs, duties, &c. as before.\r\nHe was ready to prove that the ancestors of O'Cahan never enjoyed the\r\npremises at any time, but at the will and sufferance of O'Neill and\r\nhis ancestors. A few days after, he despatched a memorial to the king\r\nsetting forth his grievances, in which he stated that there were so\r\nmany that sought to deprive him of the greatest part of the residue\r\nof his territory that without his majesty's special consideration he\r\nshould in the end have nothing to support his 'estate' or rank. For\r\nthe Lord Bishop of Derry, not content with the great living the king\r\nhad bestowed upon him, sought to have the greater part of the earl's\r\nlands, to which none of his predecessors had ever laid claim. And\r\nhe also set on others to question his titles which had never before\r\nbefore doubted. He therefore humbly besought the king to direct that\r\nnew letters patent should be made out re-conveying to him and his\r\nheirs the lands in dispute, being, he said, 'such a favour as is\r\nappointed by your majesty to be extended to such of your subjects of\r\nthis kingdom as should be suitors for the same, amongst whom I will\r\nduring my life endeavour to deserve to be in the number of the most\r\nfaithful, whereunto not only duty, but also your majesty's great\r\nbounty, hath ever obliged me.'\r\n\r\nThis was dated at Mellifont on May 26, 1607. It does not appear that\r\nany answer was received to his appeals to the king, nor is it likely\r\nthat it served his cause, for it is seldom safe to appeal from an\r\nagent or deputy to the supreme authority. The Privy Council in Dublin,\r\nhowever, made a report confirming to some extent the claims put forth\r\nby Tyrone. A jury had been appointed to inquire into the boundaries\r\nand limits of the lands granted by Queen Elizabeth, and they found\r\nthat they extended from the river Fuin to Lough Foyle, and from Lough\r\nFoyle by the sea-shore to the Bann, and thence to the east of Lough\r\nNeagh. Within these limits they found that there existed the territory\r\ncalled O'Cahan's, Glenconkeine and Killetragh, which were not the\r\nlands of the O'Neills, '_but held by tenants having estates in them\r\nequivalent to estates of freehold_.' The jury could not determine what\r\nrents the tenants of said lands were accustomed to pay, but they found\r\ngenerally that all lands within the limits of Tyrone, except the lands\r\nof the church, rendered to O'Neill bonnaght or free quarters for armed\r\nretainers, 'rising out, cutting and spending.' The parties, however,\r\ndid not abide by the decision of the privy council, but kept up their\r\ncontention in the courts of law. It was quite clear that matters could\r\nnot remain long in that unsettled state, with so many adventurers\r\nthirsting for the possession of land, which was lying comparatively\r\nidle. It was thought desirable to appoint a president of Ulster, as\r\nthere had been a president of Munster. The Earl of Tyrone applied to\r\nthe king for the office, evidently fearing that if Chichester were\r\nappointed, he must share the fate of the Earl of Desmond. On the other\r\nhand, it was felt that with his hereditary pretensions, impracticable\r\ntemper, and vast influence with the people, it would be impossible to\r\nestablish the English power on a permanent basis until he was got out\r\nof the way. This was not difficult, with unprincipled adventurers\r\nwho were watching for opportunities to make their fortunes in those\r\nrevolutionary times. Among these was a person named St. Lawrence,\r\nBaron of Howth. This man worked cunningly on the mind of the lord\r\ndeputy, insinuating that O'Neill was plotting treason and preparing\r\nfor a Spanish invasion. He even went so far as to write an anonymous\r\nletter, revealing an alleged plot of O'Neill's to assassinate the lord\r\ndeputy. It was addressed to Sir William Usher, clerk of the council,\r\nand the writer began by saying that it would show him, though far\r\nsevered from him in religion, how near he came home to him in honesty.\r\nHe was a Catholic, and professed to reveal what he had heard among\r\nCatholic gentlemen, 'after the strictest conditions of secresy.' The\r\nconspirators were, in the first place, to murder or poison the lord\r\ndeputy when he came to Drogheda, 'a place thought apt and secure to\r\nact the same.' They thought it well to begin with him, because his\r\nauthority, wisdom, and valour stood only in the way of their first\r\nattempts. Next after him they were to cut off Sir Oliver Lambert,\r\nwhom for his own judgment in the wars, his sudden resolution, and\r\nundertaking spirit, they would not suffer to live. These two lights\r\nthus put out, they would neither fear nor value any opposite in the\r\nkingdom. The small dispersed garrisons must either through hunger\r\nsubmit themselves to their mercy, or be penned up as sheep to the\r\nshambles. They held the castle of Dublin for their own, neither manned\r\nnor victualled, and readily surprised. The towns were for them, the\r\ncountry with them, the great ones abroad prepared to answer the first\r\nalarm. The Jesuits warranted from the Pope and the Catholic king would\r\ndo their parts effectually, and Spanish succours would not be wanting.\r\nThese secrets greatly troubled the sensitive conscience of Lord Howth.\r\nFrom the time he was entrusted with them, he said, 'till I resolved to\r\ngive you this caveat, my eyelids never closed, my heart was a fire,\r\nmy soul suffered a thousand thousand torments; yet I could not, nor\r\ncannot persuade my conscience, in honesty, to betray my friends,\r\nor spill their bloods, when this timely warning may prevent the\r\nmischief.' In conclusion, he said, 'though I reverence the mass and\r\nthe Catholic religion equal with the devoutest of them, I will make\r\nthe leaders of this dance know that I prefer my country's good before\r\ntheir busy and ambitious humours.' It is related of this twenty-second\r\nbaron of Howth, known as Sir Christopher St. Lawrence, that having\r\nserved in Ulster under Essex, and accompanied him in his flight to\r\nEngland, he proposed to murder Lord Grey de Wilton, lest he should\r\nprejudice the queen's mind against her former favourite, if he got\r\naccess to her presence before him; that he had commanded a regiment of\r\ninfantry under Mountjoy, and that when that regiment was disbanded, he\r\nbecame discontented, not having got either pension or employment;\r\nthat having gone as a free lance to the Low Countries, and failed to\r\nadvance himself there as he expected, through the interest of\r\nIrish ecclesiastics, he returned to England, and skulked about the\r\nante-chambers of Lord Salisbury, waiting upon Providence, when he hit\r\nupon the happy idea of the revelations which he conveyed under the\r\nsignature of' A.B.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meehan, p.103.]\r\n\r\nAfter some time he acknowledged the authorship of the letter\r\nprivately, but refused to come forth publicly as an informer, nor\r\nwas he able to produce any corroboration of the improbable story.\r\nUltimately, however, when pressed by Chichester, he induced his friend\r\nBaron Devlin to swear an information to the same effect, revealing\r\ncertain alleged conversations of O'Neill. In the meantime St. Lawrence\r\ncunningly worked upon the fears of the earl, giving him to understand\r\nthat his ruin was determined on, and that he had better consult\r\nhis safety, by leaving the country. It appears that he received\r\nintimations to the same effect from his correspondents in Spain and\r\nin London. At all events, he lost heart, became silent, moody, and\r\nlow-spirited, suspecting foul play on the part of the king, who was\r\nvery urgent that he should be brought over to London, in which case\r\nTyrone was led to believe that he would certainly be sent to the\r\nTower, and probably lose his head. With such apprehensions, he came\r\nto the conclusion that it was idle to struggle any longer against the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nHe had for some weeks been engaged quietly making preparations for his\r\nflight. He had given directions to his steward to collect in advance\r\none half of his Michaelmas rents, leading the lord deputy to think\r\nthat he did so either to provide funds for his journey to London,\r\nor to defray the expenses of his son's projected marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Lord Argyle. Meanwhile a vessel had been purchased by\r\nCu-Connaught Maguire, and Bath, the captain of this vessel, assured\r\nthe Earl of Tyrconnel, whom he met at Ballyshannon, that he also\r\nwould lose his life or liberty if he did not abandon the country with\r\nO'Neill. On September 8, Tyrone took leave of the lord deputy, and\r\nthen spent a day and night at Mellifont with his friend Sir Garret\r\nMoore, who was specially dear to him as the fosterer of his son John.\r\nThe earl took his leave with unusual emotion, and after giving\r\nhis blessing according to the Irish fashion to every member of his\r\nfriend's household, he and his suite took horse and rode rapidly by\r\nDundalk, over the Fews to Armagh, where he rested a few hours, and\r\nthen proceeded to Creeve, one of his crannoges or island habitations,\r\nwhere he was joined by his wife and other members of his family. Sir\r\nOliver Lambert in a communication to the Irish Government, relating to\r\nthe affairs of Ulster, made some interesting allusions to O'Neill. He\r\nstates that he had apologised for having appealed to the king in the\r\ncase between him and O'Cahan, and said that he felt much grieved in\r\nbeing called upon so suddenly to go to England, when on account of his\r\npoverty he was not able to furnish himself as became him for such a\r\njourney and for such a presence. In all things else, said Sir Oliver,\r\n'he seemed very moderate and reasonable, albeit he never gave over to\r\nbe a general solicitor in all causes concerning his country and people\r\nhowever criminal.' He thought the earl had been much abused by persons\r\nwho had cunningly terrified, and diverted him from going to the king;\r\n'or else he had within him a thousand witnesses testifying that he was\r\nas deeply engaged in these secret treasons as any of the rest, whom\r\nthey knew or suspected.' At all events he had received information\r\non the previous day from his own brother Sir Cormac O'Neill, from the\r\nprimate, from Sir Toby Caulfield and others, that the earl had taken\r\nshipping with his lady, the Baron of Dungannon, his eldest son, and\r\ntwo others of his children, John and Brien, both under seven years\r\nold, the Earl of Tyrconnel, and his son and heir, an infant, not yet a\r\nyear old, his brother Caffar O'Donel, and his son an infant two years\r\nold, 'with divers others of their nearest and trusted followers and\r\nservants, as well men as women, to the number of between thirty and\r\nforty persons.'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Meehan gives graphic details of the flight of his two\r\nheroes. Arrived at Rathmullen they found Maguire and Captain Bath\r\nlaying stores of provisions on board the ship that had come into Lough\r\nSwilly under French colours. Here they were joined by Rory, Earl of\r\nTyrconnel. At noon on Friday they all went on board and lifted anchor,\r\nbut kept close to the shore waiting for the boats' crews, who were\r\nprocuring water and fuel; but they had to wait till long after sunset,\r\nwhen the boats came with only a small quantity of wood and water.\r\nAccording to a fatality which makes one Irishman's extremity another\r\nIrishman's opportunity, the foraging party was set upon by M'Sweeny\r\nof Fanad, who churlishly prevented them getting a sufficient supply\r\nof these necessaries. This barbarous conduct is accounted for by Mr.\r\nMeehan, from the fact, that this M'Sweeny had recently taken a grant\r\nof his lands from the crown. At midnight, September 14, 1607, they\r\nspread all sail and made for the open sea, intending, however, to\r\nland on the Island of Arran, off the coast of Donegal, to provide\r\nthemselves with more water and fuel. The entire number of souls\r\non board this small vessel, says O'Keenan in his narrative, was\r\nninety-nine, having little sea store, and being otherwise miserably\r\naccommodated. Unable to make the island of Arran, owing to a gale\r\nthen blowing off the land, and fearing to be crossed by the king's\r\ncruisers, they steered for the harbour of Corunna in Spain. But for\r\nthirteen days, continues O'Keenan, 'the sea was angry, and the tempest\r\nleft us no rest; and the only brief interval of calm we enjoyed, was\r\nwhen O'Neill took from his neck a golden crucifix containing a relic\r\nof the true cross, and trailed it in the wake of the ship. At that\r\nmoment, two poor merlins with wearied pinions sought refuge in the\r\nrigging of our vessel, and were captured for the noble ladies, who\r\nnursed them with tenderest affection.' After being tempest-tossed\r\nfor three weeks, they dropped anchor in the harbour of Quilleboeuf\r\nin France, having narrowly escaped shipwreck, their only remaining\r\nprovisions being one gallon of beer and a cask of water. They\r\nproceeded to Brussels and thence to Louvain, where splendid\r\naccommodation was provided for them. In several of the cities through\r\nwhich they passed they received ovations, their countrymen clerical\r\nand military having prepared for their reception with the greatest\r\nzeal and devotion. The King of Spain was of course friendly, but to\r\navoid giving offence to King James he discouraged the stay of the\r\nexiles in his dominions, and they found their final resting-place\r\nat Rome, where the two earls were placed upon the Pope's civil list,\r\nwhich, however, they did not long continue to burden. Tyrconnel fell a\r\nvictim to the malaria, and died on July 28, 1608. 'Sorrowful it was,'\r\nsay the Four Masters, 'to contemplate his early eclipse, for he was a\r\ngenerous and hospitable lord, to whom the patrimony of his ancestors\r\nseemed nothing for his feastings and spending.' His widow received\r\na pension of 300 l. a year out of his forfeited estates. O'Neill\r\nsurvived his brother earl eight years, having made various attempts to\r\ninduce the King of Spain to aid him in the recovery of his patrimony.\r\nHe died in 1616, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. Sir Francis\r\nCottington, announcing the event from Madrid, said, 'The Earl of\r\nTyrone is dead at Rome; by whose death this king saves 500 ducats\r\nevery month, for so much pension he had from here, well paid him.\r\nUpon the news of his death, I observed that all the principal Irish\r\nentertained in several parts of this kingdom are repaired unto this\r\ncourt.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT APPEALS TO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flight of the earls caused great consternation to the Irish\r\nGovernment. Letters were immediately despatched to the local\r\nauthorities at every port to have a sharp look out for the fugitives,\r\nand to send out vessels to intercept them, should they be driven back\r\nby bad weather to any part of the coast. At the same time the lord\r\ndeputy sent a despatch to the Government in London, deprecating\r\ncensure for an occurrence so unexpected, and so much to be regretted,\r\nbecause of the possibility of its leading to an invasion by the\r\nSpaniards. In other respects it was regarded by the principal members\r\nof the Irish Government, and especially by the officials in Ulster, as\r\na most fortunate occurrence. For example, Sir Oliver Lambert, in his\r\nreport to the lords of the council, already referred to, said:--'But\r\nnow these things are fallen out thus, contrary to all expectation\r\nor likelihood, by the providence of God I hope, over this miserable\r\npeople, for whose sake it may be he hath sent his majesty this rare\r\nand unlocked for occasion: whereby he may now at length, with good\r\napprehension and prudent handling, repair an error which was committed\r\nin making these men proprietary lords of so large a territory, without\r\nregard of the poor freeholders' rights, or of his majesty's service,\r\nand the commonwealth's, that are so much interested in the honest\r\nliberty of that sort of men, which now, in time, I commend unto your\r\nlordships' grave consideration and wisdom, and will come to that which\r\nnearest concerns ourselves and the whole.'\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir John Davis, in his letter to the first minister, Lord\r\nSalisbury, Tyrone could not be reconciled in his heart to the English\r\nGovernment, because 'he ever lived like a free prince, or, rather,\r\nlike an absolute tyrant, there. The law of England, and the ministers\r\nthereof, were shackles and handlocks unto him.' He states that _after\r\nthe Irish manner_, he made all the tenants of his land _villeins_.\r\n'Therefore to evict any part of that land from him was as grievous\r\nunto him as to pinch away the quick flesh from his body ... Besides,'\r\nthe attorney-general added, 'as for us that are here, we are glad to\r\nsee the day wherein the countenance and majesty of the law, as civil\r\ngovernment, hath banished Tyrone out of Ireland, which the best army\r\nin Europe, and the expense of two millions of sterling pounds did not\r\nbring to pass. And we hope his majesty's happy government will work\r\na greater miracle in this kingdom, than ever St. Patrick did; for St.\r\nPatrick did only banish the poisonous worms, but suffered the men full\r\nof poison to inhabit the land still; but his majesty's blessed genius\r\nwill banish all that generation of vipers out of it, and make it, ere\r\nit be long, a right fortunate island.'\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir Geoffry Fenton, writing to Salisbury on the same subject,\r\nsays, 'And now I am to put your lordship in mind what a door is open\r\nto the king, if the opportunity be taken, and well converted, not only\r\nto pull down for ever these two proud houses of O'Neill and O'Donel,\r\nbut also to bring in colonies to plant both countries, to a great\r\nincreasing of his majesty's revenues, and to establish and settle the\r\ncountries perpetually in the crown; besides that many well-deserving\r\nservitors may be recompensed in the distribution; a matter to be taken\r\nto heart, for that it reaches somewhat to his majesty's conscience and\r\nhonour to see these poor servitors relieved, whom time and the wars\r\nhave spent, even unto their later years, and now, by this commodity,\r\nmay be stayed and comforted without charges to his majesty.' This\r\nadvice was quite in accordance with the views of the prime minister,\r\nwho in a letter to Chichester said, 'I do think it of great necessity\r\nthat those countries be made the king's by this accident; that there\r\nbe a mixture in the plantation, the _natives_ made his majesty's\r\ntenants of part, but the rest to be divided among those that will\r\n_inhabit_; and in no case any man is suffered to embrace more than\r\nis visible he can and will _manure_. That was an oversight in the\r\nplantation of Munster, where 12,000 acres were commonly allotted to\r\nbankrupts and country gentlemen, that never knew the disposition of\r\nthe Irish; so as God forbid that those who have spent their blood in\r\nthe service should not of all others be preferred.' It was because\r\nthis idea of manuring, i.e. residence and cultivation, was carried\r\nout in Ulster, that the plantation has proved so successful. But Davis\r\nwould allow but small space comparatively to the natives, whom he\r\ncompared to weeds which, if too numerous, would choke the wheat. With\r\nhim the old inhabitants were simply a nuisance from the highest to\r\nthe lowest; and if there were no other way of getting rid of them, he\r\nwould no doubt have adopted the plan recommended by Lord Bacon,\r\nwho said, 'Some of the chiefest of the Irish families should\r\nbe transported to England, and have recompense there for their\r\npossessions in Ireland, till they were cleansed from their blood,\r\nincontinency, and theft, which were not the lapses of particular\r\npersons, but the very laws of the nation.' The Lord Deputy Chichester,\r\nhowever, agreed thoroughly with his attorney-general, for he certainly\r\nmade no more account of rooting out the 'mere Irish' from their homes\r\nthan if they were the most noxious kinds of weeds or vermin. 'If,'\r\nsaid he, writing to Lord Salisbury, 'I have observed anything during\r\nmy stay in this kingdom, I may say it is not _lenity_ and good works\r\nthat will reclaim the Irish, but _an iron rod_, and severity of\r\njustice, for the restraint and punishment of those firebrands of\r\nsedition, _the priests_; nor can we think of any other remedy but to\r\nproclaim _them, and their relievers and harbourers, traitors_.'\r\n\r\nConsidering that those Englishmen were professedly Christian rulers,\r\nengaged in establishing the reformed religion, the accounts which they\r\ngive with perfect coolness of their operations in this line, are among\r\nthe most appalling passages to be met with in the world's history. For\r\ninstance, the lord deputy writes: 'I have often said and written, it\r\nis _famine that must consume the Irish_, as our _swords_ and other\r\nendeavours worked not that, speedy effect which is expected; _hunger_\r\nwould be a better, because a speedier, weapon to employ against them\r\nthan the sword.' He spared no means of destruction, but combined all\r\nthe most fearful scourges for the purpose of putting out of existence\r\nthe race of people whom God in his anger subjected to his power.\r\nSurely the spirit of cruelty, the genius of destruction, must have\r\nbeen incarnate in the man who wrote thus: 'I burned all along the\r\nLough (Neagh) within four miles of Dungannon, and killed 100 people,\r\nsparing none, of what quality, age, or sex soever, besides _many\r\nburned to death_. We killed man, _woman and child_, horse, beast, and\r\nwhatsoever we could find.'\r\n\r\nAt the time of the flight of the earls, however, he was very anxious\r\nabout the safety of the kingdom. He was aware that the people were\r\nuniversally discontented, he had but few troops in the country,\r\nand little or no money in the treasury, so that in case of a sudden\r\ninvasion, it was quite possible that the maddened population would\r\nrise and act in their own way upon his own merciless policy of\r\nextermination. He therefore hastened to issue a proclamation for the\r\npurpose of reassuring the inhabitants of Ulster, and persuading\r\nthem that they would not suffer in any way by the desertion of\r\ntheir chiefs. In this proclamation, headed by 'The _Lord Deputy\r\nand Counsell_,' it was stated that Tyrone and Tyrconnel and their\r\ncompanions had lately embarked themselves at Lough Swilly and had\r\nsecretly and suddenly departed out of this realm without license or\r\nnotice. The Government was as yet uncertain about their purpose\r\nor destination. But inasmuch as the manner of their departure,\r\nconsidering the quality of their persons, might raise many doubts\r\nin the minds of his majesty's loving subjects in those parts, and\r\nespecially the common sort of people inhabiting the counties of\r\nTyrone and Tyrconnel, who might suppose they were in danger to suffer\r\nprejudice in their _lands_ and goods for the contempt or offence of\r\nthe earls,--they were solemnly assured that they had nothing whatever\r\nto fear. The words of the proclamation on this point are: 'We do\r\ntherefore in his majesty's name declare, proclaim, and publish that\r\nall and every his majesty's good and loyal subjects inhabiting those\r\ncountries of Tyrone and Tyrconnel shall and may quietly and securely\r\npossess and enjoy all and singular _their lands and goods_ without the\r\ntrouble or molestation of any of his majesty's officers or ministers\r\nor any other person or persons whatsoever as long as they disturb not\r\nhis majesty's peace, but live as dutiful and obedient subjects. And\r\nforasmuch as the said earls to whom his majesty, reposing special\r\ntrust in their loyalty, had committed the government of the said\r\nseveral countries are now undutifully departed, therefore his Majesty\r\ndoth graciously receive all and every of his said loyal subjects into\r\nhis own immediate safeguard and protection, giving them full assurance\r\nto defend them and every of them by his kingly power from all violence\r\nor wrong, which any loose persons among themselves or any foreign\r\nforce shall attempt against them. And to that end, we the lord deputy\r\nand council have made choice of certain commissioners as well Irish as\r\nEnglish, residing in the said several countries, not only to preserve\r\nthe public peace there, but also to administer speedy and indifferent\r\njustice to all his majesty's loving subjects in those parts, which\r\nshall have any cause of complaint before them.' All governors, mayors,\r\nsheriffs, justices of peace, provost-marshals, bailiffs, constables,\r\nand all other his majesty's ministers whatsoever were strictly charged\r\nto use their utmost endeavours faithfully and diligently to keep the\r\npeople in their duty and obedience to his majesty and the laws of the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nThe assurance thus given that the subjects and tenants of the\r\nabsconding princes should securely possess and enjoy their lands and\r\nbe protected from all oppression under the sceptre of King James would\r\nhave been very satisfactory had the royal promise been realised,\r\nbut conciliation was then absolutely necessary, for the lord deputy\r\nhimself stated that 'the kingdom had not been in the like danger these\r\nhundred years, as we have but few friends and no means of getting\r\nmore.' The foregoing proclamation was issued from Rathfarnham on\r\nSeptember 10. On November 9 following, another proclamation of a\r\ngeneral nature was published and widely circulated in order to justify\r\nthe course the Government adopted. According to this document it was\r\nknown to all the world 'how infinitely' the fugitive earls had been\r\nobliged to the king for his singular grace and mercy in giving them\r\nfree pardon for many heinous and execrable treasons, above all hope\r\nthat they could in reason conceive, and also in restoring the one to\r\nhis lands and honours justly forfeited, and in raising the other 'from\r\na very mean estate to the degree and title of an earl, giving him\r\nwithal large possessions for the support of that honour, before either\r\nof them had given any proof of loyalty, or merited the least favour.'\r\nEven in the point of religion, which served as a cloak for all their\r\ntreasons, they got no provocation or cause of grievance. For these and\r\nother causes it was announced that his majesty would seize and take\r\ninto his hands all the lands and goods of the said fugitives. But\r\nhe would, notwithstanding, extend such grace and favour to the\r\nloyal inhabitants of their territories that none of them should be\r\n'impeached, troubled, or molested in _their own lands_, goods, or\r\nbodies, they continuing in their loyalty, _and yielding unto his\r\nmajesty such rents and duties as shall be agreeable to justice and\r\nequity_.' This assurance was repeated again emphatically in these\r\nwords: 'His most excellent majesty doth take all the good and loyal\r\ninhabitants of the said countries, together with their wives and\r\nchildren, land and goods, into his own immediate protection, to defend\r\nthem in general against all rebellions and invasions, and to right\r\nthem in all their wrongs and oppressions, offered or to be offered\r\nunto them by any person whatsoever, etc.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF THE FUGITIVE EARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to notice the manner in which these promises of\r\njustice, equity, and protection to the occupiers of the land were\r\nfulfilled, it is well to record here the efforts made by King James\r\nand his ambassador to discredit the fugitive earls on the Continent,\r\nand the case which they made out for themselves in the statement of\r\nwrongs and grievances which they addressed to the king soon after.\r\nThere was great alarm in England when news arrived of the friendly\r\nreception accorded to the Irish chiefs by the continental sovereigns\r\nthrough whose dominions they passed, and especially by the King of\r\nSpain, who was suspected of intending another invasion of Ireland.\r\nConsequently the most active preparations were made to meet the\r\ndanger. In every street of the metropolis drums were beating for\r\nrecruits, and large detachments were sent in all possible haste to\r\nreinforce the Irish garrisons. Sir Charles Cornwallis was then English\r\nambassador at Madrid; and lest his diplomatic skill should not be up\r\nto the mark, James himself sent him special and minute instructions as\r\nto the manner in which he should handle the delicate subjects he had\r\nto bring before the Spanish sovereign. There has been seldom a better\r\nillustration of the saying, that the use of speech is to conceal\r\nthought, than in the representations which the ambassador was\r\ninstructed to make about Irish affairs. Indeed Cornwallis had already\r\nshown that he scarcely needed to be tutored by his sovereign. In a\r\npreliminary despatch he had sent an account of his conversation with\r\nPhilip III.'s secretary of state about the fugitive earls. He told him\r\nthat though they had been guilty of rebellions and treasons they had\r\nnot only been pardoned, but loaded with dignities such as few or none\r\nof the king's ancestors had ever bestowed on any of the Irish nation.\r\nHe had conferred upon them an absolute and, 'in a manner, unlimited\r\ngovernment in their own countries, nothing wanting to their ambitions\r\nbut the name of kings, and neither crossed in anything concerning\r\ntheir civil government, nor so much as in act or imagination molested,\r\nor in any sort questioned with, for their consciences and religion.'\r\nHe thought therefore that they would never have fled in such a way,\r\nunless they had been drawn to Spain by large promises in the hope of\r\nserving some future turns.\r\n\r\nThe secretary listened to this insinuation with much impatience, and\r\ndeclared solemnly, laying his hand on his breast with an oath, that of\r\nthe departure and intention of the earls there was no more knowledge\r\ngiven to the king or any of his state than to the ambassador himself.\r\nHe added that there had been much consumption of Spanish treasure by\r\nsupporting strangers who had come from all parts. In particular they\r\nhad a bitter taste of those who had come from James's dominions; and\r\nthey would have suffered much more, 'if they had not made a resolute\r\nand determined stop to the running of that fountain and refused to\r\ngive ear to many overtures.' The ambassador expressed his satisfaction\r\nat this assurance, and then endeavoured to show how unworthy those\r\nIrish princes were of the least encouragement. Their flight was the\r\nresult of madness, they departed without any occasion of 'earthly\r\ndistaste' or offence given them by their sovereign, whose position\r\ntowards the Irish was very different from that of the late queen.\r\nElizabeth had employed against their revolts and rebellions only her\r\nown subjects of England, who were not accustomed either to the diet\r\nof that savage country, or to the bogs, and other retreats which that\r\nwild people used. But now, the king his master, being possessed of\r\nScotland, had in that country, 'near adjoining to the north part of\r\nIreland, a people of their own fashion, diet, and disposition, that\r\ncould walk their bogs as well as themselves, live with their food,\r\nand were so well practised and accustomed in their own country to\r\nthe like, that they were as apt to pull them out of their dens and\r\nwithdrawing places, as ferrets to draw rabbits out of their burrows.'\r\nMoreover all other parts of Ireland were now reduced to such\r\nobedience, and so civil a course, and so well planted with a mixture\r\nof English, that there was not a man that showed a forehead likely to\r\ngive a frown against his majesty, or his government. Cornwallis went\r\non to plead the incomparable virtues of the king his master, among\r\nwhich liberality and magnificence were not the least. But if he had\r\ngiven largely, it was upon a good exchange, for he had sowed money,\r\nwhich of itself can do nothing, and had reaped hearts that can do\r\nall. As for the alleged number of 'groaning Catholics,' he assured\r\nthe secretary that there were hardly as many hundreds as the fugitives\r\nreckoned thousands.\r\n\r\nAccording to his report the minister heard him with great attention,\r\nand at the conclusion protested, that he joined with him in opinion\r\nthat those fugitives were dangerous people and that the Jesuits were\r\nturbulent and busy men. He assured him on the word of a caballero,\r\nthat his majesty and council had fully determined never to receive or\r\ntreat any more of those 'straying people;' as they had been put to\r\ngreat inconvenience and cost, how to deliver themselves from those\r\nIrish vagabonds, and continual begging pretenders.\r\n\r\nThis despatch, dated October 28, 1607, was crossed on the way by one\r\nfrom the English minister Salisbury, dated the 27th, giving the\r\nking's instructions 'concerning those men that are fled into Spain.'\r\nCornwallis was directed not to make matters worse than they really\r\nwere, because the end must be good, 'what insolencies soever the\r\nJesuits and pack of fugitives there might put on. King James knew that\r\nthis remnant of the northern Irish traitors had been as full of malice\r\nas flesh and blood could be, no way reformed by the grace received,\r\nbut rather sucking poison out of the honey thereof.' He knew also that\r\nthey had absolutely given commission to their priests and others to\r\nabandon their sovereign if Spain would entertain their cause. But this\r\nhe could not demonstrably prove _in foro judicii_, though clear _in\r\nforo conscientiæ_, and therefore punishment would savour of rigour.\r\nSo long as things were in that state his majesty was obliged to suffer\r\nadders in his bosom, and give them means to gather strength to his\r\nown prejudice, whereas now the whole country which they had possessed\r\nwould be made of great use both for strength and profit to the king.\r\nWhat follows should be given in his majesty's own words:--\r\n\r\n'Those poor creatures who knew no kings but those petty lords, under\r\nthe burden of whose tyranny they have ever groaned, do now with great\r\napplause desire to be protected by the immediate power, and to receive\r\ncorrection only from himself, so as if the council of Spain shall\r\nconceive that they have now some great advantage over this state,\r\nwhere it shall appear what a party their king may have if he shall\r\nlike to support it, there may be this answer: that those Irish without\r\nthe King of Spain are poor worms upon earth; and that when the King of\r\nSpain shall think it time to begin with Ireland, the king my master is\r\nmore like than Queen Elizabeth was, to find a wholesomer place of the\r\nKing of Spain's, where he would be loath to hear of the English, and\r\nto show the Spaniards who shall be sent into Ireland as fair a way as\r\nthey were taught before. In which time the more you speak of the base,\r\ninsulting, discoursing fugitives, the more proper it will be for you.\r\nIn the meantime upon their departure, not a man hath moved, neither\r\nwas there these thirty years more universal obedience than there is\r\nnow. Amongst the rest of their barbarous lies I doubt not but they\r\nwill pretend protection for religion, and breach of promise with them;\r\nwherein you may safely protest this, that for any, of all those that\r\nare gone, there never was so much as an offer made to search their\r\nconsciences.'\r\n\r\nNot content with the labours of his ambassadors at the various\r\ncontinental courts, to damage the cause of the Irish earls, the king\r\nissued a proclamation, which was widely dispersed abroad. His majesty\r\nsaid he thought it better to clear men's judgments concerning the\r\nfugitives, 'not in respect of any worth or value in these men's\r\npersons, being base and rude in their original,' but to prevent any\r\nbreach of friendship with other princes. For this purpose he declared\r\nthat Tyrone and Tyrconnel had not their creation or possessions in\r\nregard of any lineal or lawful descent from ancestors of blood or\r\nvirtue, but were only conferred by the late queen and himself for some\r\nreasons of state. Therefore, he judged it needless to seek for\r\nmany arguments 'to confirm whatsoever should be said of these men's\r\ncorruption and falsehood, whose heinous offences remained so fresh in\r\nmemory since they declared themselves so very monsters in nature, as\r\nthey did not only withdraw themselves from their personal obedience to\r\ntheir sovereign, but were content to sell over their native country,\r\nto those who stood at that time in the highest terms of hostility with\r\nthe crowns of England and Ireland.' 'Yet,' adds the king, 'to make the\r\nabsurdity and ingratitude of the allegation above mentioned so much\r\nthe more clear to all men of equal judgment, we do hereby profess\r\nin word of a king that there was never so much as any shadow of\r\nmolestation, nor purpose of proceeding in any degree against them\r\nfor matter concerning religion:--such being their condition and\r\nprofession, to think murder no fault, marriage of no use, nor any\r\nman worthy to be esteemed valiant that did not glory in rapine and\r\noppression, as we should have thought it an unreasonable thing to\r\ntrouble them for any different point in religion, before any man could\r\nperceive by their conversation that they made truly conscience of any\r\nreligion. The king thought these declarations sufficient to disperse\r\nand to discredit all such untruths as these contemptible creatures, so\r\nfull of infidelity and ingratitude, should discharge against him and\r\nhis just and moderate proceedings, and which should procure unto them\r\nno better usage than they would wish should be afforded to any such\r\npack of rebels born their subjects and bound unto them in so many and\r\nso great obligations.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the case of the English Government presented to the world\r\nby the king and his ministers. Let us now hear what the personages\r\nso heartily reviled by them had to say for themselves. The Rev. C.P.\r\nMeehan has brought to light the categorical narratives, which the\r\nearls dictated, and which had lain unpublished among the 'old historic\r\nrolls,' in the Public Record Office, London. These documents are of\r\ngreat historic interest, as are many other state-papers now first\r\npublished in his valuable work.[1] O'Neill's defence is headed,\r\n'Articles Exhibited by the Earl of Tyrone to the King's Most Excellent\r\nMajesty, declaring certain Causes of Discontent offered Him, by which\r\nhe took occasion to Depart His Country.' The statement is divided\r\ninto twenty items, of which the following is the substance: It was\r\nproclaimed by public authority in his manor of Dungannon, that none\r\nshould hear mass upon pain of losing his goods and imprisonment, and\r\nthat no ecclesiastical person should enjoy any cure or dignity without\r\nswearing the oath of supremacy and embracing the contrary religion,\r\nand those who refused so to do were actually deprived of their\r\nbenefices and dignities, in proof of which the earl referred to the\r\nlord deputy's answer to his own petition, and to the Lord Primate of\r\nIreland, who put the persecuting decree into execution. The Earl\r\nof Devon, then lord-lieutenant, had taken from him the lands of his\r\nancestors called the Fews, in Armagh, and given them to other persons.\r\nHe was deprived of the annual tribute of sixty cows from Sir Cahir\r\nO'Dogherty's country called Inishowen, which tribute had never been\r\nbrought into question till James's reign. The same lord-lieutenant had\r\ntaken from him the fishings of the Bann, which always belonged to his\r\nancestors, and which he was forced to purchase again. Portions of his\r\nterritory had been taken 'under colour of church-lands, a thing never\r\nin any man's memory heard of before.' One Robert Leicester an attorney\r\nhad got some more of the earl's land, which he transferred to Captain\r\nLeigh. 'So as any captain or clerk had wanted means, and had no other\r\nmeans or device to live, might bring the earl in trouble for some part\r\nor parcel of his living, falsely inventing the same, to be concealed\r\nor church-land.' The Archbishop of Armagh and the Bishop of Derry\r\nand Clogher claimed the best part of the earl's whole estate, as\r\nappertaining to their bishoprics, 'which was never moved by any other\r\npredecessors before, other than that they had some _chiefry_ due to\r\nthem, in most part of all his living, and would now have the whole\r\nland to themselves as their domain lands, not content with the benefit\r\nof their ancient registers, which the earl always offered, and\r\nwas willing to give without further question. O'Cahan, 'one of the\r\nchiefest and principalest of the earl's tenants, was set upon by\r\ncertain of his majesty's privy council, as also by his highness's\r\ncounsel-at-law, to withdraw himself and the lands called\r\n_Iraght-I-Cahan_ from the earl, being a great substance of his\r\nliving;' and this although O'Cahan had no right to the property except\r\nas his _tenant at will_, yielding and paying all such rents, dues,\r\nand reservations as the other tenants did. He complained that at\r\nthe council table in Dublin it was determined to take two-thirds of\r\nO'Cahan's country from him; and he perceived by what Sir John Davis\r\nsaid, that they had determined to take the other third also. They\r\nfurther made claim in his majesty's behalf to four other parcels of\r\nthe earl's land, which he named, being the substance of all that was\r\nleft, and began their suit for the same in the court of exchequer.\r\nIn fine he felt that he could not assure himself of anything by the\r\nletters patent he had from the king. Whenever he had recourse to law\r\nhis proceedings were frustrated by the government; so that he could\r\nnot get the benefit of his majesty's laws, or the possession of his\r\nlands; 'and yet any man, of what degree soever, obtained the extremity\r\nof the law with favour against him, in any suit.' Although the king\r\nhad allowed him to be lieutenant of his country, yet he had no more\r\ncommand there than his boy; the worst man that belonged to the sheriff\r\ncould command more than he, and that even in the earl's own house. If\r\nthey wanted to arrest any one in the house they would not wait till\r\nhe came out, but burst open the doors, and 'never do the earl so much\r\nhonour in any respect as once to acquaint him therewith, or to send to\r\nhimself for the party, though he had been within the house when they\r\nwould attempt these things; and if any of the earl's officers would\r\nby his direction order or execute any matter betwixt his own tenants,\r\nwith their own mutual consent, they would be driven not only to\r\nrestore the same again, but also be first amerced by the sheriff, and\r\nafter indicated as felons, and so brought to trial for their lives\r\nfor the same; so as the earl in the end could scarce get any of his\r\nservants that would undertake to levy his rents.' According to law the\r\nsheriff should be a resident in the county, have property there, and\r\nbe elected by the nobility and chief gentlemen belonging to it; but\r\nthe law was set aside by the lord deputy, who appointed as sheriffs\r\nfor the counties Tyrone and Armagh Captain Edmund Leigh and one\r\nMarmaduke Whitechurch, dwelling in the county of Louth, both being\r\nretainers, and very dear friends to the Knight-marshal Bagenal, who\r\nwas the only man that urged the earl to his last troubles. Of all\r\nthese things 'the earl did eftsoons complain to the lord deputy,\r\nand could get no redress, but did rather fare the worse for his\r\ncomplaints, in respect they were so little regarded.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Page 192.]\r\n\r\nThe earl understanding that earnest suit had been made to his majesty\r\nfor the presidentship of Ulster, made bold to write to the king,\r\nhumbly beseeching him not to grant any such office to any person over\r\nhimself, 'suspecting it would be his overthrow, as by plain experience\r\nhe knew the like office to be the utter overthrow of others of his\r\nrank in other provinces within the realm of Ireland.' He also wrote\r\nto the Earl of Salisbury, who replied that the earl was not to tie his\r\nmajesty to place or displace officers at his (the earl's) pleasure in\r\nany of his majesty's kingdoms. This was not the earl's meaning, but it\r\nindicated to him pretty plainly that he had no favour to expect from\r\nthat quarter. The office was intended for Sir Arthur Chichester, and\r\nhe much feared that it would be used for his destruction without\r\nhis majesty's privity. Therefore, seeing himself envied by those who\r\nshould be his protectors, considering the misery sustained by\r\nothers through the oppression of the like government, he resolved to\r\nsacrifice all rather than live under that yoke.\r\n\r\nThe next item is very characteristic. The earl's nephew Brian M'Art\r\nhappened to be in the house of Turlough M'Henry, having two men in his\r\ncompany. Being in a merry humour, some dispute arose between him and\r\na kinsman of his own, who 'gave the earl's nephew a blow of a club\r\non the head, and tumbled him to the ground; whereupon, one of his men\r\nstanding by and seeing his master down, did step up with the fellow\r\nand gave him some three or four stabs of a knife, having no other\r\nweapon, and the master himself, as it was said, gave him another,\r\nthrough which means the man came to his death. Thereupon, the earl's\r\nnephew and his two men were taken and kept in prison till the next\r\nsessions holden in the county Armagh, where his men were tried by a\r\njury of four innocent and mere ignorant people, having little or no\r\nsubstance, most of them being bare soldiers and not fit, as well by\r\nthe institution of law in matters of that kind as also through their\r\nown insufficiency, to be permitted or elected to the like charge;\r\nand the rest foster-brethren, followers, and very dear friends to the\r\nparty slain, that would not spare to spend their lives and goods to\r\nrevenge his death. Yet all that notwithstanding were they allowed,\r\nand the trial of these two gentlemen committed to them, through which\r\nmeans, and the vigorous threatening and earnest enticements of the\r\njudges, they most shamefully condemned to die, and the jury in a\r\nmanner forced to find the matter murder in each of them, and that,\r\nnot so much for their own offences, as thinking to make it an evidence\r\nagainst the master, who was in prison in the Castle of Dublin,\r\nattending to be tried the last Michaelmas term, whose death, were it\r\nright or wrong, was much desired by the lord deputy.\r\n\r\nAgain, the earl had given his daughter in marriage to O'Cahan with\r\na portion of goods. After they had lived together for eight years,\r\nO'Cahan was induced to withdraw himself from the earl, and at the same\r\ntime, by the procurement of his setters on, he turned off the earl's\r\ndaughter, kept her fortune to himself, and married another. The\r\nfather appealed to the lord deputy for justice in vain. He then took\r\nproceedings against O'Cahan, at the assizes in Dungannon. But the\r\ndefendant produced a warrant from the lord deputy, forbidding the\r\njudges to entertain the question, as it was one for the Lord Bishop of\r\nDerry. The Bishop of Derry, however, was the chief instigator of the\r\ndivorce, and therefore no indifferent judge in the case. Thus the\r\nearl's cause was frustrated, and he could get no manner of justice\r\ntherein, no more than he obtained in many other weighty matters that\r\nconcerned him. The next complaint is about outrages committed by\r\none Henry Oge O'Neill, one Henry M'Felemey and others, who at the\r\ninstigation of the lord deputy, 'farther to trouble the earl,' went\r\nout as a wood-kerne to rob and spoil the earl and his nephew, and\r\ntheir tenants. They committed many murders, burnings, and other\r\nmischievous acts, and were always maintained and manifestly relieved\r\namongst the deputy's tenants and their friends in Clandeboye, to whom\r\nthey openly sold the spoils. They went on so for the space of two\r\nyears, and the earl could get no justice, till at length they murdered\r\none of the deputy's own tenants. Then he saw them prosecuted, and the\r\nresult was, that the earl cut them all off within a quarter of a year\r\nafter. But the lord deputy was not at all pleased with this. Therefore\r\nhe picked up 'a poor rascally knave' and brought him to Dublin, where\r\nhe persuaded him to accuse above threescore of the earl's tenants of\r\nrelieving rebels with meat, although it was taken from them by force.\r\nFor the rebels killed their cattle in the fields, and left them dead\r\nthere, not being able to carry them away; burnt their houses,\r\ntook what they could of their household stuff, killed and mangled\r\nthemselves. 'Yet were they, upon report of that poor knave, who was\r\nhimself foremost in doing these mischiefs, all taken and brought\r\nto their trial by law, where they were, through their innocency,\r\nacquitted, to their no small cost; so as betwixt the professed enemy,\r\nand the private envy of our governors, seeking thereby to advance\r\nthemselves, there was no way left for the poor subject to live.'\r\n\r\nOne Joice Geverard, a Dutchman, belonging to the deputy, was taken\r\nprisoner on his way from Carrickfergus to Toome, and he was compelled\r\nto pay to his captors a ransom of 30 l. For this the lord deputy\r\nassessed 60 l. on the county, and appointed one-half of it to be taken\r\nfrom O'Neil's tenants, being of another county, and at least twelve\r\nmiles distant from the scene of the outrage, perpetrated by a\r\nwood-kerne, 'and themselves being daily killed and spoiled by the said\r\nwood-kerne, and never no redress had to them.' Several outrages and\r\nmurders perpetrated by the soldiers are enumerated; but they were such\r\nas might have been expected in a state bordering on civil war, which\r\nwas then the condition of the province. If, however, Tyrone is to be\r\nbelieved, the rulers themselves set the example of disorder. Sir\r\nHenry Folliott, governor of Ballyshannon, in the second year of his\r\nmajesty's reign, came with force of arms, and drove away 200 cows from\r\nthe earl's tenants, 'and killed a good gentleman, with many other poor\r\nmen, women, and children; and besides that, there died of them above\r\n100 persons with very famine, for want of their goods; whereof the\r\nearl never had redress, although the said Sir Henry could show no\r\nreasonable cause for doing the same.'\r\n\r\nFinally the earl saw that the lord deputy was very earnest to\r\naggravate and search out matters against him, touching the staining\r\nof his honour and dignity, scheming to come upon him with some forged\r\ntreason, and thereby to bereave him of both his life and living. The\r\nbetter to compass this he placed his 'whispering companion,' Captain\r\nLeigh, as sheriff in the county, 'so as to be lurking after the earl,\r\nto spy if he might have any hole in his coat.' Seeing then that the\r\nlord deputy, who should be indifferent, not only to him but to\r\nthe whole realm, having the rod in his own power, did seek his\r\ndestruction, he esteemed it a strife against the stream for him to\r\nseek to live secure in that kingdom, and therefore of both evils\r\nhe did choose the least, and thought it better rather to forego\r\nhis country and lands, till he had further known his majesty's\r\npleasure--to make an honourable escape with his life and liberty only,\r\nthan by staying with dishonour and indignation to lose both life,\r\nliberty, and country, which much in very deed he feared. Indeed the\r\nmany abuses 'offered' him by Sir John Davis, 'a man more fit to be a\r\nstage player than a counsel,' and other inferior officers, might be\r\nsufficient causes to provoke any human creature, not only to forego\r\na country, were it ever so dear to him, but also the whole world, to\r\neschew the like government. And thus he concludes his appeal to\r\nhis 'most dread sovereign:' 'And so referring himself, and the due\r\nconsideration of these, and all other his causes, to your majesty's\r\nmost royal and princely censure, as his only protector and defender,\r\nagainst all his adversaries, he most humbly taketh his leave, and will\r\nalways, as in bounden duty, pray.'\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Tyrconnel's statement contains no less than forty-four\r\nitems under the following heading: 'A note, or brief collection of\r\nthe several exactions, wrongs, and grievances, as well spiritual\r\nas temporal, wherewith the Earl of Tyrconnel particularly doth find\r\nhimself grieved and abused by the king's law ministers in Ireland,\r\nfrom the first year of his majesty's reign until this present year of\r\n1607: to be presented to the king's most excellent majesty.'\r\n\r\n_Imprimis_, all the priests and religious persons dwelling within\r\nthe said earl's territories were daily pursued and persecuted by his\r\nmajesty's officers. Sir Arthur Chichester told him, in the presence of\r\ndivers noblemen and gentlemen, that he must resolve to go to church,\r\nor he would be forced to go. This was contrary to the toleration which\r\nhad been till then enjoyed, and he resolved rather to abandon lands\r\nand living, yea, all the kingdoms of the earth, with the loss of his\r\nlife, than to be forced utterly against his conscience to any such\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir George Carew was lord deputy, Captain Nicholas Pynnar\r\nand Captain Basil Brook, officers of the king's forces at Lifford,\r\nplundered the earl's tenants there, taking from them 150 cows, besides\r\nas many sheep and swine as they pleased. Not satisfied with this\r\nspoil, they most tyrannically stripped 100 persons of all their\r\napparel. These outrages the earl complained of 'in humble wise' to the\r\nlord deputy, and could find no remedy; for the same year the garrisons\r\nof Lough Foyle, and Ballyshannon took from the earl's tenants 400 cows\r\nfor the victualling of the soldiers; and although the English council\r\nwrote to the lord deputy, requiring him to pay for the cattle in\r\nEnglish money, the payment was never made. When, in pursuance of a\r\npromise made to him by the lord deputy, he appeared before the king,\r\nto get new letters patent of his territories, &c., his property, in\r\nSligo, Tyrawly, Moylurg, Dartry, Sir Cahir O'Dogherty's country,\r\nand all Sir Nial O'Donel's lands, were excepted and kept from him,\r\ntogether with the castle of Ballyshannon and 1,000 acres of land, and\r\nthe whole salmon-fishing of the river Erne, worth 800 l. a year, 'the\r\nsame castle being one of the earl's chieftest mansion houses.' They\r\nalso took from him 1,000 acres of his best land, and joined it to\r\nthe garrison of Lifford for the king's use, without any compensation.\r\nThere were seven sheriffs sent into Tyrconnel, by each of which there\r\nwas taken out of every cow and plough-horse 4 d., and as much out of\r\nevery colt and calf twice a year, and half-a-crown a quarter of every\r\nshoemaker, carpenter, smith, and weaver in the whole country, and\r\neight pence a year for every married couple.'\r\n\r\nSir Nial O'Donel was committed to prison by Tyrconnel, for usurping\r\nthe title of O'Donel and taking his herds and tenants. 'He broke loose\r\nfrom prison and killed some of his Majesty's subjects. For this the\r\nearl prosecuted him under a special warrant from the lord deputy;\r\nbut notwithstanding all this, Carew gave warrants to Captains Pynnar,\r\nBrook, and Bingley, to make reprisals upon the earl's tenants for the\r\npretender's use. Accordingly three English companies joining with nine\r\nscore of Sir Nial's men, seized and carried away 500 cows, 60 mares,\r\n30 plough-horses, 13 horses, besides food and drink to support the\r\nassailants for six weeks. They were guilty of many other extortions,\r\nthe country being extremely poor after the wars, and 17 of the earl's\r\ntenants were hindered from ploughing that season. A certain horse-boy,\r\nwho was sentenced to be hanged for killing one Cusack, was promised\r\nhis life by Sir George Carew, if he accused Tyrconnel as having\r\nemployed him to commit the murder. The boy did make the accusation,\r\nwhich served no purpose 'but to accelerate his hanging.' Thus\r\nbetrayed, he declared at the gallows, and in the presence of 400\r\npersons, the sheriff of the county, and the portreve of Trim, he\r\nretracted the false confession. A similar attempt was made with an\r\nEnglishman, who was kept a close prisoner without food, drink, or\r\nlight, in order to get him to accuse the earl of Cusack's murder.\r\nAll such, with many other of the said Carew's cruel and tyrannical\r\nproceedings, the earl showed to the council in England, which promised\r\nto give satisfaction by punishing the said Carew, who at his arrival\r\nin England did rather obtain greater favours than any reprehension or\r\ncheck of his doings, so as the earl was constrained to take _patience_\r\nfor a full satisfaction of his wrongs.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Docwra, governor of Derry, levied 100 l. off Tyrconnel's\r\ntenants for the building of a church in that city, but the money was\r\napplied by Sir Henry to his own use. Carew ordered the troops under\r\nSir H. Docwra, Sir H. Folliott, Sir Ralph Constable, Sir Thomas\r\nRoper, and Captain Doddington, to be quartered for three months upon\r\nTyrconnel's people, 'where they committed many rapes, and used many\r\nextortions, which the earl showed, and could neither get payment\r\nfor their victuals nor obtain that they should be punished for their\r\nsundry rapes and extortions.' Indeed there was never a garrison in\r\nTyrconnel that did not send at their pleasure private soldiers into\r\nthe country to fetch, now three beeves, now four, as often as they\r\nliked, until they had taken all; and when the earl complained,\r\nCarew seemed rather to flout him than any way to right him. Sir H.\r\nFolliott's company on one occasion took from his tenants thirty-eight\r\nplough-horses, which were never restored or paid for; at another\r\ntime they took twenty-one, and again fourteen. This being done in the\r\nspring of the year the tenants were hindered from ploughing as before.\r\nDuring a whole year Folliott took for the use of his own house,\r\nregularly every month, six beeves and six muttons, without any manner\r\nof payment. Captain Doddington and Captain Cole made free with the\r\npeople's property in the same manner.\r\n\r\n'All these injuries he laid in a very humble manner before the lord\r\ndeputy, but instead of obtaining redress he was dismissed by him in a\r\nscoffing manner, and even a lawyer whom he employed was threatened by\r\nCarew in the following terms:--that he and his posterity should smart\r\nfor his doings until the seventh generation; so that all the earl's\r\nbusiness was ever since left at random, and no lawyer dared plead in\r\nhis cause.'\r\n\r\nTyrconnel killed some rebels, and captured their chief, whom his men\r\ncarried to Sir H. Folliott to be executed. Sir Henry offered to spare\r\nhis life if he could accuse the earl of any crime that might work\r\nhis overthrow. He could not, and he was hanged. In order to settle\r\na dispute between the earl and Sir Nial, the English _protégé_ and\r\npretender to the chieftainship, twelve tenants of each were summoned\r\nto be examined by the king's officers in the neighbourhood. 'The\r\nearl's men were not examined, but locked up in a room; and the\r\nvice-governor, upon the false deposition of Sir Nial's men, directed\r\nwarrants, and sent soldiers to the number of 300, to bring all the\r\nearl's tenants unto Sir Nial, to the number of 340 persons, who paid\r\nhalf-a-crown a piece, and 12 d. for every cow and garron, as a fee\r\nunto the captains, whereby they lost their ploughing for the space of\r\ntwenty-eight days, the soldiers being in the country all the while.\r\nOne Captain Henry Vaughan, being sheriff in the year 1605, got a\r\nwarrant to levy 150 l. to build a sessions house. He built the house\r\nof timber and wattles. It was not worth 10_l_, and it fell in three\r\nmonths. Nevertheless he levied every penny of the money, and the\r\npeople had to meet a similar demand the next year, to build another\r\nhouse. It was a rule with the governors of the local garrisons to\r\noffer his life to every convict about to be executed, and also a large\r\nreward, if he could accuse the earl of some detestable crime. No less\r\nthan twenty-seven persons hanged in Connaught and Tyrone were offered\r\npardon on this condition. He was at the same sessions called to the\r\nbar for hanging some wood-kerne, although he had authority from the\r\nking to execute martial law. Shortly after, by the lord deputy's\r\norders, the horse and foot soldiers under Docwra and Folliott were\r\ncessed upon the country, where they for four months remained, and paid\r\nnothing for their charges of horse-meat or man's meat.' In the year\r\n1606 the lord deputy came to Ballyshannon, where, being at supper, he\r\ndemanded of the earl what right he had to the several territories he\r\nclaimed. He replied that his ancestors had possessed them for 1,300\r\nyears, and that the duties, rents, and homages were duly paid during\r\nthat time. Whereupon the lord deputy said, 'the earl was unworthy to\r\nhave them, he should never enjoy them, the State was sorry to have\r\nleft so much in his possession, and he should take heed to himself\r\nor else the deputy would make his pate ache.' The matters in dispute\r\nbetween him and Sir Nial being referred on that occasion to the lord\r\ndeputy, both parties having submitted their papers for examination,\r\nevery case was decided against Tyrconnel, all his challenges\r\nfrustrated, 300 l. damages imposed, and his papers burned; while Sir\r\nNial's papers were privately given back to him. The result was that\r\nat the next sessions Sir Nial had the benefit of all his papers,\r\nhis opponent having nothing to show to the contrary. The fishery\r\nof Killybegs, worth 500 l. a season, had belonged to Tyrconnel's\r\nancestors for 1,300 years. But it was taken from him without\r\ncompensation, by Sir Henry Folliott and the Bishop of Derry, with\r\nthe ultimate sanction of the lord deputy, who confirmed the bishop in\r\npossession 'both for that season and for all times ensuing.' Sir H.\r\nFolliott on one occasion took away for his carriage the horses\r\nthat served the earl's house with fuel and wood for fire, 'and the\r\nsoldiers, scorning to feed the horses themselves, went into the earl's\r\nhouse, and forcibly took out one of his boys to lead them, and ran\r\nanother in the thigh with a pike for refusing to go with him.' He\r\nhad a number of tenants, who held their lands 'by lease of years for\r\ncertain rents.' Yet the lord deputy sent warrants to them, directing\r\nthem to pay no rents, and requiring the Governor of Derry 'to raise\r\nthe country from time to time, and resist and hinder the earl from\r\ntaking up his rents.'\r\n\r\nTo crown all, when Tyrconnel made a journey into the Pale to know the\r\nreason why he was debarred from his rents, he lodged on his way in the\r\nAbbey of Boyle. He had scarcely arrived there when the constable of\r\nthe town, accompanied by twenty soldiers, and all the churls of the\r\nplace, surrounded and set fire to the house where he lay, he having no\r\ncompany within but his page and two other serving men. 'But it befell,\r\nthrough the singular providence of Almighty God, whose fatherly care\r\nhe hath ever found vigilant over him, that he defended himself and his\r\nhouse against them all the whole night long, they using on the other\r\nside all their industry and might to fire it, and throwing in of\r\nstones and staves in the earl's face, and running their pikes at him\r\nand swords until they had wounded him, besides his other bruisings,\r\nwith stones and staves in six places; they menacing to kill him,\r\naffirming that he was a traitor to the king, and that it was the best\r\nservice that could be rendered to his majesty to kill him. And that\r\nall this is true, Sir Donough O'Conor, who was taken prisoner by the\r\nsame men, because he would not assist them in their _facinorous_ and\r\nwicked design of killing the earl, will justify; but in the morning\r\nthe earl was rescued by the country folk, which conveyed him safely\r\nout of the town. And when the earl complained, and showed his wounds\r\nunto the lord deputy, he promised to hang the constable and ensign,\r\nbut afterwards did not once deign so much as to examine the matter\r\nor call the delinquents to account, by reason whereof the earl doth\r\nverily persuade himself--which his surmise was afterwards confirmed\r\nin time, by the credible report of many--that some of the State\r\nwere sorry for his escape, but specially Sir Oliver Lambert, who had\r\npurposely drawn the plot of the earl's ruin.'\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: marker for following footnote is missing in the\r\noriginal]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Meehan's Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel, pp. 192-224.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFISCATION OF ULSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Toby Caulfield, accompanied by the sheriffs of Tyrone and\r\nTyrconnel, followed quickly the proclamation of the lord deputy to\r\nthe people of Ulster, and took possession of the houses, goods, and\r\nchattels of the fugitive earls. Sir Toby was further empowered to act\r\nas receiver over the estates, taking up the rents according to the\r\nIrish usage until other arrangements could be made. His inventory\r\nof the effects of O'Neill in the castle of Dungannon is a curious\r\ndocument, showing that according to the ideas of those times in the\r\nmatter of furniture 'man wants but little here below.' The following\r\nis a copy of the document taken from the memorandum roll of the\r\nexchequer by the late Mr. Ferguson.

The money-rents were chargeable on all the\r\ncows, milch or in calf, which grazed on his lands, at the rate of\r\na shilling a quarter each. The cows were to be numbered in May and\r\nNovember by the earl's officers, and 'so the rents were taken up at\r\nsaid rate for all the cows that were so numbered, except only the\r\nheads and principal men of the _creaghts_, as they enabled them to\r\nlive better than the common multitude under them, whom they caused to\r\npay the said rents, which amounted to about twelve hundred sterling\r\nIrish a year.\r\n\r\n'The butter and other provisions were usually paid by those styled\r\nhorsemen--O'Hagans, O'Quins, the O'Donnillys, O'Devolins, and others.'\r\nThese were a sort of middle men, and to some of them an allowance was\r\nmade by the Government. 'Thus for example, Loughlin O'Hagan, formerly\r\nconstable of the castle of Dungannon, received in lieu thereof a\r\nportion of his brother Henry's goods, and Henry O'Hagan's wife and her\r\nchildren had all her husband's goods, at the suit of her father Sir\r\nG. O'Ghy O'Hanlon, who had made a surrender of all his lands to the\r\ncrown.'\r\n\r\nThe cattle were to be all numbered over the whole territory in one\r\nday, a duty which must have required a great number of men, and sharp\r\nmen too; for, if the owners were dishonestly inclined, and were\r\nas active in that kind of work as the peasantry were during the\r\nanti-tithe war in our own time, the cattle could be driven off into\r\nthe woods or on to the lands of a neighbouring lord. However, during\r\nthe three years that Caulfield was receiver, the rental amounted\r\nto 12,000 l. a year, a remarkable fact considering the enormous\r\ndestruction of property that had taken place during the late wars, and\r\nthe value of money at that time.\r\n\r\nA similar process was adopted with regard to the property of O'Donel,\r\nand guards were placed in all the castles of the two chiefs. In order\r\nthat their territories might pass into the king's possession by due\r\nform of law, the attorney-general, Sir John Davis, was instructed to\r\ndraw up a bill of indictment for treason against the fugitive\r\nearls and their adherents. With this bill he proceeded to Lifford,\r\naccompanied by a number of commissioners, clerks, sheriffs, and a\r\nstrong detachment of horse and foot. At Lifford, the county town of\r\nDonegal, a jury was empanelled for the trial of O'Donel, consisting\r\nof twenty-three Irishmen and ten Englishmen. Of this jury Sir Cahir\r\nO'Dogherty was foreman. He was the lord of Inishowen, having the\r\nlargest territories in the county next to the Earl of Tyrconnel. The\r\nbill being read in English and Irish, evidence was given, wrote the\r\nattorney-general, 'that their guilty consciences, and fear of losing\r\ntheir heads, was the cause of their flight.' The jury, however, had\r\nexactly the same sort of difficulty that troubled the juries in our\r\nlate Fenian trials about finding the accused guilty of compassing the\r\ndeath of the sovereign. But Sir John laboured to remove their scruples\r\nby explaining the legal technicality, and arguing that, 'whoso would\r\ntake the king's crown from his head would likewise, if he could, take\r\nhis head from his shoulders; and whoever would not suffer the king to\r\nreign, if it lay in his power, would not suffer the king to live.' The\r\nargument was successful with the jury. In all the conflicts between\r\nthe two races, whether on the field of battle or in the courts of law,\r\nthe work of England was zealously done by Celtic agents, who became\r\nthe eager accusers, the perfidious betrayers, and sometimes the\r\nvoluntary assassins of men of their own name, kindred, and tribe.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners next sat at Strabane, a town within two or three\r\nmiles of Lifford, where a similar jury was empanelled for the county\r\nTyrone, to try O'Neill. One of the counts against him was that he had\r\ntreasonably taken upon him the name of O'Neill. In proof of this a\r\ndocument was produced: 'O'Neill bids M'Tuin to pay 60 l.' It was also\r\nalleged that he had committed a number of murders; but his victims,\r\nit was alleged, were criminals ordered for execution in virtue of the\r\npower of life and death with which he had been invested by the queen.\r\nHe was found guilty, however; and Henry Oge O'Neill, his kinsman,\r\nwho was foreman of the jury, was complimented for his civility and\r\nloyalty, although he belonged to that class concerning which Sir John\r\nafterwards wrote, 'It is as natural for an Irish lord to be a thief\r\nas it is for the devil to be a liar, of whom it was written, he was a\r\nliar and a murderer from the beginning.'\r\n\r\nTrue bills having been found by the grand juries, proceedings were\r\ntaken in the Court of King's Bench to have the fugitive earls and\r\ntheir followers attainted of high treason. The names were:--'Hugh\r\nearl of Tyrone, Rory earl of Tyrconnel, Caffar O'Donel, Cu Connaught\r\nMaguire, Donel Oge O'Donel, Art Oge, Cormack O'Neill, Henry\r\nO'Neill, Henry Hovenden, Henry O'Hagan, Moriarty O'Quinn, John Bath,\r\nChristopher Plunket, John O'Punty O'Hagan, Hugh O'Galagher, Carragh\r\nO'Galagher, John and Edmund M'Davitt, Maurie O'Multully, Donogh\r\nO'Brien, M'Mahon, George Cashel, Teigue O'Keenen, and many other false\r\ntraitors, who, by the instigation of the devil, did conspire and plot\r\nthe destruction and death of the king, Sir Arthur Chichester, &c.; and\r\ndid also conspire to seize by force of arms the castles of Athlone,\r\nBallyshannon, Duncannon, co. Wexford, Lifford, co. Donegal, and with\r\nthat intent did sail away in a ship, to bring in an army composed of\r\nforeigners to invade the kingdom of Ireland, to put the king to death,\r\nand to dispose him from the style, title, power, and government of the\r\nImperial crown.'\r\n\r\nThe lord deputy and his officers, able, energetic, farseeing men,\r\nworking together persistently for the accomplishment of a well-defined\r\npurpose, were drawing the great net of English law closer and closer\r\naround the heads of the Irish clans, who struggled gallantly and\r\nwildly in its fatal meshes. The episode of Sir Cahir O'Dogherty is\r\na romance. On the death of Sir John O'Dogherty, the O'Donel, in\r\naccordance with Irish custom, caused his brother Phelim Oge to be\r\ninaugurated Prince of Inishowen, because Cahir, his son, was then\r\nonly thirteen years of age, too young to command the sept. But this\r\narrangement did not please his foster brothers, the M'Davitts, who\r\nproposed to Sir Henry Docwra, governor of Derry, that their youthful\r\nchief should be adopted as the queen's O'Dogherty; and on this\r\ncondition they promised that he and they would devote themselves to\r\nher majesty's service. The terms were gladly accepted. Sir Cahir was\r\ntrained by Docwra in martial exercises, in the arts of civility, and\r\nin English literature. He was an apt pupil. He grew up strong and\r\ncomely; and he so distinguished himself before he was sixteen years\r\nof age in skirmishes with his father's allies, that Sir Henry wrote\r\nof him in the following terms: 'The country was overgrown with ancient\r\noak and coppice. O'Dogherty was with me, alighted when I did, kept me\r\ncompany in the greatest heat of the fight, behaved himself bravely,\r\nand with a great deal of love and affection; so much so, that I\r\nrecommended him at my next meeting with the Lord Deputy Mountjoy, for\r\nthe honour of knighthood, which was accordingly conferred upon him.'\r\nThe young knight went to London, was well received at court, and\r\nobtained a new grant of a large portion of the O'Dogherty's country.\r\nHe married a daughter of Lord Gormanstown, a catholic peer of the\r\nPale, distinguished for loyalty to the English throne, resided with\r\nhis bride at his Castle of Elagh, or at Burt, or Buncranna, keeping\r\nprincely state, not in the old Irish fashion, but in the manner of an\r\nEnglish nobleman of the period; hunting the red deer in his forest,\r\nhawking, or fishing in the teeming waters of Lough Foyle, Lough\r\nSwilly, and the Atlantic, which poured their treasures around the\r\npromontory of which he was the lord. His intimate associates were\r\nofficers and favourites of the king.\r\n\r\nDocwra had given up the government of Derry and retired to England. He\r\nwas succeeded by Sir George Paulet, a man of violent temper. Sir Cahir\r\nhad sold 3,000 acres of land, which was to be planted with English;\r\nand, in order to perfect the deed of sale, it was necessary to have\r\nthe document signed before the governor of Derry. It had been reported\r\nto the lord deputy that Sir Cahir, not content with his position,\r\nintended to leave the country, probably with the design of joining the\r\nfugitive earls in an attempt to destroy the English power in\r\nIreland. He was therefore summoned before the lord deputy; and Lord\r\nGormanstown, Thomas Fitzwilliam of Merrion, and himself, were obliged\r\nto give security that he should not quit Ireland without due notice\r\nand express permission. This restraint had probably irritated his\r\nhot impetuous spirit, and made it difficult for him to exercise due\r\nself-control when he came in contact with the English governor of\r\nDerry, with whom his relations were not improved by the suspicions now\r\nattaching to his loyalty. Accordingly, while the legal forms of\r\nthe transfer were being gone through, the young chief made a remark\r\nextremely offensive to Paulet, which was resented by a blow in the\r\nface with his clenched fist. Instead of returning the blow, young\r\nO'Dogherty hurried away to consult the M'Davitts, whose advice was\r\nthat the insult he received must be avenged by blood. The affair\r\nhaving been immediately reported to the lord deputy, who apprehended\r\nthat mischief would come of it, he sent a peremptory summons to Sir\r\nCahir, requiring him to appear in Dublin, 'to free himself of certain\r\nrumours and reports touching disloyal courses into which he had\r\nentered, contrary to his allegiance to the king, and threatening the\r\noverthrow of many of his majesty's subjects.' His two sureties were\r\nalso written to, and required to 'bring in his body.' But O'Dogherty\r\nutterly disregarded the lord deputy's order. Taking counsel with Nial\r\nGarve O'Donel, he resolved to seize Culmore Fort, Castle Doe, and\r\nother strong places; and then march on Derry, and massacre the English\r\nsettlers in the market square.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of April, Sir Cahir invited Captain Harte, governor\r\nof Culmore Castle, on the banks of the Foyle, about four miles from\r\nDerry, with his wife and infant child, of which he was the godfather,\r\nto dine with him at his Castle of Elagh.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was sumptuous, and the pleasures of the table\r\nprotracted to a late hour. After dinner the host took his guest into\r\na private apartment, and told him that the blow he had received from\r\nPaulet demanded a bloody revenge. Harte remonstrated; O'Dogherty's\r\nretainers rushed in, and, drawing their swords and skeines, declared\r\nthat they would kill his wife and child in his presence, unless he\r\ndelivered up the castle of Culmore. The governor was terrified, but\r\nhe refused to betray his trust. Sir Cahir, commanding the armed men to\r\nretire, locked the chamber door, and kept his guest imprisoned\r\nthere for two hours, hoping that he would yield when he had time for\r\nreflection. But finding him still inflexible, O'Dogherty grew furious,\r\nand vented his rage in loud and angry words. Mrs. Harte, hearing the\r\naltercation, and suspecting foul play, rushed into the room, and\r\nfound Sir Cahir enforcing his appeal with a naked sword pointed at her\r\nhusband's throat. She fell on the floor in a swoon. Lady O'Dogherty\r\nran to her assistance, raised her up, and assured her that she knew\r\nnothing of her husband's rash design. The latter then thrust the whole\r\nparty down-stairs, giving orders to his men to seize Captain Harte.\r\nMeantime, Lady Harte fell on her knees, imploring mercy, but the only\r\nresponse was an oath that she and her husband and child should be\r\ninstantly butchered if Culmore were not surrendered. What followed\r\nshall be related in the words of Father Meehan: 'Horrified by this\r\nmenace, she consented to accompany him and his men to the fort, where\r\nthey arrived about midnight. On giving the pass word the gate was\r\nthrown open by the warder, whose suspicions were lulled when Lady\r\nHarte told him that her husband had broken his arm and was then lying\r\nin Sir Cahir's house. The parley was short, and the followers of\r\nSir Cahir, rushing in to the tower, fell on the sleeping garrison,\r\nslaughtered them in their beds, and then made their way to an upper\r\napartment where Lady Harte's brother, recently come from England,\r\nwas fast asleep. Fearing that he might get a bloody blanket for his\r\nshroud, Lady Harte followed them into the room, and implored the\r\nyoung man to offer no resistance to the Irish, who broke open trunks,\r\npresses and other furniture, and seized whatever valuables they could\r\nclutch. Her thoughtfulness saved the lives of her children and\r\nher brother; for as soon as Sir Cahir had armed his followers with\r\nmatchlocks and powder out of the magazine, he left a small detachment\r\nto garrison Culmore, and then marched rapidly on Derry, where he\r\narrived about two o'clock in the morning. Totally unprepared for\r\nsuch an irruption, the townsfolk were roused from their sleep by the\r\nbagpipes and war-shout of the Clan O'Dogherty, who rushed into the\r\nstreets, and made their way to Paulet's house, where Sir Cahir, still\r\nsmarting under the indignity of the angry blow, satisfied his vow of\r\nvengeance by causing that unhappy gentleman to be hacked to death with\r\nthe pikes and skeines of Owen O'Dogherty and others of his kindred.\r\nAfter plundering the houses of the more opulent inhabitants, seizing\r\nsuch arms as they could find, and reducing the young town to a heap\r\nof ashes, Sir Cahir led his followers to the palace of Montgomery the\r\nbishop, who fortunately for himself was then absent in Dublin. Not\r\nfinding him, they captured his wife, and sent her, under escort, to\r\nBurt Castle, whither Lady O'Dogherty, her sister-in-law and infant\r\ndaughter, had gone without warders for their protection. It was on\r\nthis occasion that Phelim M'Davitt got into Montgomery's library and\r\nset fire to it, thus destroying hundreds of valuable volumes, printed\r\nand manuscript, a feat for which he is not censured--we are sorry to\r\nhave to acknowledge it--by Philip O'Sullivan in his account of\r\nthe fact. Elated by this successful raid, Sir Cahir called off his\r\nfollowers and proceeded to beleaguer Lifford, where there was a small\r\ngarrison of English who could not be induced to surrender, although\r\nsuffering severely from want of provisions. Finding all his attempts\r\nto reduce the place ineffectual, he sent for the small force he had\r\nleft in Culmore to join the main body of his partisans, and then\r\nmarched into M'Swyne Doe's country.'\r\n\r\nMeantime news of these atrocities reached Dublin, and the lord deputy\r\nimmediately sent a force of 3,000 men, commanded by Sir Richard\r\nWingfield, Sir Thomas Roper, and Sir Toby Caulfield, with instructions\r\nto pursue the revolted Irish into their fastnesses and deal with them\r\nsummarily. He himself set out to act with the troops, and on reaching\r\nDundalk published a proclamation, in which he offered pardon to\r\nall who laid down their arms, or would use them in killing their\r\nassociates. He took care, however, to except Phelim M'Davitt from all\r\nhope of mercy, consigning him to be dealt with by a military tribunal.\r\nThe English force in the interval had made their way into O'Dogherty's\r\ncountry, and coming before Culmore, found it abandoned by the Irish,\r\nwho, unable to carry off the heavy guns, took the precaution of\r\nburying them in the sea. Burt Castle surrendered without a blow.\r\nWingfield immediately liberated the inmates, and sent Bishop\r\nMontgomery's wife to her husband, and Lady O'Dogherty, her infant\r\ndaughter and sister-in-law, to Dublin Castle. As for Sir Cahir,\r\ninstead of going to Castle Doe, he resolved to cross the path of the\r\nEnglish on their march to that place, and coming up with them in the\r\nvicinity of Kilmacrenan, he was shot dead by a soldier. The death of\r\nthe young chieftain spread panic among his followers, most of\r\nwhom flung away their arms, betook themselves to flight, and were\r\nunmercifully cut down. Sir Cahir's head was immediately struck off and\r\nsent to Dublin, where it was struck upon a pole at the east gate of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nO'Dogherty's country was now confiscated, and the lord deputy,\r\nChichester, was rewarded with the greatest portion of his lands. But\r\nwhat was to be done with the people? In the first instance they were\r\ndriven from the rich lowlands along the borders of Lough Foyle and\r\nLough Swilly, and compelled to take refuge in the mountain fastnesses\r\nwhich stretched to a vast extent from Moville westward along the\r\nAtlantic coast. But could those 'idle kerne and swordsmen,' thus\r\npunished with loss of lands and home for the crimes of their chief,\r\nbe safely trusted to remain anywhere in the neighbourhood of the new\r\nEnglish settlers? Sir John Davis and Sir Toby Caulfield thought of\r\na plan by which they could get rid of the danger. The illustrious\r\nGustavus Adolphus was then fighting the battles of Protestantism\r\nagainst the house of Austria. In his gallant efforts to sustain the\r\ncause of the Reformation every true Irish Protestant sympathised, and\r\nnone more than the members of the Irish Government. To what better\r\nuse, then, could the 'loose Irish kerne and swordsmen' of Donegal be\r\nturned than to send them to fight in the army of the King of Sweden?\r\nAccordingly 6,000 of the able-bodied peasantry of Inishown were\r\nshipped off for this service. Sir Toby Caulfield, founder of the\r\nhouse of Charlemont, was commissioned to muster the men and have them\r\ntransported to their destination, being paid for their keep in the\r\nmeantime. A portion of his account ran thus: 'For the dyett of 80 of\r\nsaid soldiers for 16 daies, during which tyme they were kept in prison\r\nin Dungannon till they were sent away, at iiiid le peece per diem;\r\nallso for dyett of 72 of said men kept in prison at Armagh till they\r\nwere sent away to Swethen, at iiiid le peece per diem,' &c., &c.\r\nCaulfield was well rewarded for these services; and Captain Sandford,\r\nmarried to the niece of the first Earl of Charlemont, obtained a\r\nlarge grant of land on the same score. This system of clearing out the\r\nrighting men among the Irish was continued till 1629, when the lord\r\ndeputy, Falkland, wrote that Sir George Hamilton, a papist, then\r\nimpressing soldiers in Tyrone and Antrim, was opposed by one\r\nO'Cullinan, a priest, who was rash enough to advise the people to stay\r\nat home and have nothing to do with the Danish wars. For this he was\r\narrested, committed to Dublin Castle, tortured and then hanged.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the immediate followers of O'Dogherty in his insane\r\ncourse, many of the most prominent leaders were tried by court-martial\r\nand executed. Others were found guilty by ordinary course of law.\r\nAmong these was O'Hanlon, Sir Cahir's brother-in-law. Pie was hanged\r\nat Armagh; and his youthful wife was found by a soldier, 'stripped of\r\nher apparel, in a wood, where she perished of cold and hunger, being\r\nlately before delivered of a child.' M'Davitt, the firebrand of the\r\nrebellion, was convicted and executed at Derry. At Dungannon Shane,\r\nCarragh O'Cahan was found guilty by 'a jury of his _kinsmen_' and\r\nexecuted in the camp, his head being stuck upon the castle of that\r\nplace--the castle from which his brother was mainly instrumental in\r\ndriving its once potent lord into exile. At the same place a monk, who\r\nwas a chief adviser of the arch-rebel, saved his life and liberty by\r\ntearing off his religious habit, and renouncing his allegiance to\r\nthe Pope. Father Meehan states that many of the clergy, secular and\r\nregular, of Inishown might have saved their lives by taking the oath\r\nof supremacy. It was a terrible time in Donegal. No day passed without\r\nthe killing and taking of some of the dispersed rebels, one betraying\r\nanother to get his own pardon, and the goods of the party betrayed,\r\naccording to a proviso in the deputy's proclamation. Among the\r\ninformers was a noble lady, the mother of Hugh Roe O'Donel and Rory\r\nEarl of Tyronnel, who accused Nial Garve, her own son-in-law, of\r\ncomplicity in O'Dogherty's revolt, for which she got a grant of some\r\nhundreds of acres in the neighbourhood of Kilmacrenan.\r\n\r\nThe insurgent leaders and the dangerous kerne having been effectually\r\ncleared off in various ways, the whole territory of Inishown was\r\noverrun by the king's troops. The lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester,\r\nwith a numerous retinue, including the attorney-general, sheriffs,\r\nlawyers, provosts-martial, engineers, and 'geographers,' made a grand\r\n'progress,' and penetrated for the first time the region which was to\r\nbecome the property of his family. It was a strange sight to the poor\r\nIrish that were suffered to remain. 'As we passed through the glens\r\nand forests,' wrote Sir John Davis, 'the wild inhabitants did as much\r\nwonder to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Virgil did to see\r\nÆneas alive in hell.' In this exploring tour a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe country was for the first time obtained, and the attorney-general\r\ncould report that 'before Michaelmas he would be ready to present to\r\nhis majesty a perfect survey of six whole counties which he now hath\r\nin actual possession in the province of Ulster, of greater extent of\r\nland than any prince in Europe hath in his own hands to dispose of.' A\r\nvast field for plantation! But Sir John Davis cautioned the Government\r\nagainst the mistakes that caused the failure of former settlements,\r\nsaying, that if the number of the Scotch and English who were to come\r\nto Ireland did not much exceed that of the natives, the latter would\r\nquickly 'overgrow them, as weeds overgrow corn.'\r\n\r\nO'Cahan, who was charged with complicity in O'Dogherty's outbreak, or\r\nwith being at least a sympathiser, had been arrested, and was kept,\r\nwith Nial Garve, a close prisoner in Dublin Castle. An anonymous\r\npamphleteer celebrated the victories that had been achieved by the\r\nlord deputy, giving to his work the title, 'The Overthrow of an Irish\r\nRebel,' having for its frontispiece a tower with portcullis, and the\r\nO'Dogherty's head impaled in the central embrazure. The spirit of the\r\nnarrative may be inferred from the following passage: 'As for Tyrone\r\nand Co., or Tyrconnel, they are already fled from their coverts, and I\r\nhope they will never return; and for other false hearts, the chief of\r\nnote is O'Cahan, Sir Nial Garve, and his two brothers, with others of\r\ntheir condition. They have holes provided for them in the castle of\r\nDublin, where I hope they are safe enough from breeding any cubs to\r\ndisquiet and prey upon the flock of honest subjects.'\r\n\r\nO'Cahan and his companion, however, tried to get out of the hole,\r\nalthough the lord deputy kept twenty men every night to guard the\r\ncastle, in addition to the ordinary ward, and two or three of the\r\nguards lay in the same rooms with the prisoners. Their horses had\r\narrived in town, and all things were in readiness. But their escape\r\nwas hindered by the fact that Shane O'Carolan, who had been acquitted\r\nof three indictments, cast himself out of a window at the top of the\r\ncastle by the help of his mantle, which broke before he was half way\r\ndown; and though he was presently discovered, yet he escaped about\r\nsupper time. 'Surely,' exclaimed the lord deputy, 'these men do go\r\nbeyond all nations in the world for desperate escapes!' The prisoners\r\nwere subsequently conveyed to the Tower, where they remained many\r\nyears closely confined, and where they ended their days. Sir Allen\r\nApsley, in 1623, made a report of the prisoners then in his custody,\r\nin which he said, 'There is here Sir Nial Garve O'Donel, a man that\r\nwas a good subject during the late queen's time, and did as great\r\nservice to the state as any man of his nation. He has been a prisoner\r\nhere about thirteen years. His offence is known specially to the Lord\r\nChichester. Naghtan, his son, was taken from Oxford and committed with\r\nhis father. I never heard any offence he did.'\r\n\r\nWhile O'Cahan was in prison, commissioners sat in his mansion at\r\nLimavaddy, including the Primate Usher, Bishop Montgomery of Derry,\r\nand Sir John Davis. They decided that by the statute of 11 Elizabeth,\r\nwhich it was supposed had been cancelled by the king's pardon, all his\r\nterritory had been granted to the Earl of Tyrone, and forfeited by\r\nhis flight. It was, therefore, confiscated. Although sundry royal and\r\nviceregal proclamations had assured the tenants that they would not\r\nbe disturbed in their possessions, on account of the offences of their\r\nchiefs, it was now declared that all O'Cahan's country belonged to\r\nthe crown, and that neither he nor those who lived under him had any\r\nestate whatever in the lands. Certain portions of the territory were\r\nset apart for the Church, and handed over to Bishop Montgomery. 'Of\r\nall the fair territory which once was his, Donald Balagh had not now\r\nas much as would afford him a last resting-place near the sculptured\r\ntomb of Cooey-na-gall. O'Cahan got no sympathy, and he deserved\r\nnone; for he might have foreseen that the Government to which he sold\r\nhimself would cast him off as an outworn tool, when he could no\r\nlonger subserve their wicked purposes.'[1] 'Thus were the O'Cahans\r\ndispossessed by the colonists of Derry, to whom their broad lands and\r\nteeming rivers were passed, _mayhap_ for ever. Towards the close of\r\nthe Cromwellian war in Ireland, the Duchess of Buckingham, passing\r\nthrough Limavaddy, visited its ancient castle, then sadly dilapidated,\r\nand, entering one of the apartments, saw an aged woman wrapped in a\r\nblanket, and crouching over a peat fire, which filled the room with\r\nreeking smoke. After gazing at this pitiful spectacle, the duchess\r\nasked the miserable individual her name; when the latter, rising and\r\ndrawing herself up to her full height, replied, \"I am the wife of\r\nthe O'Cahan.\"'[Father Meehan dedicates his valuable work to the lord\r\nchancellor of Ireland, the Right Hon. Thomas O'Hagan,--the first\r\nCatholic chancellor since the Revolution. Descended from the O'Hagans,\r\nwho were hereditary justiciaries and secretaries to the O'Neill, he\r\nis, by universal consent, one of the ablest and most accomplished\r\njudges that ever adorned the Irish Bench. His ancestors were involved\r\nin the fortunes of Tyrone. How strange that the representative of the\r\njudicial and literary clan of ancient Ulster should now be the head of\r\nthe Irish magistracy!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meehan, p.317.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTATION OF ULSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the account which the lord deputy gave of the flight of Tyrone\r\nand Tyrconnel, he referred to the mistake that had been committed in\r\nmaking these men proprietary lords of so large a territory, '_without\r\nregard to the poor freeholders' rights, or of his majesty's service,\r\nor the commonwealths, that are so much interested in the honest\r\nliberty of that sort of men_.' And he considered it a providential\r\ncircumstance that the king had now an opportunity of repairing that\r\nerror, and of relieving the natives from the exactions and tyranny of\r\ntheir former barbarous lords. How far this change was a benefit to\r\nthe honest freeholders and the labouring classes may be seen from the\r\nreports of Sir Toby Caulfield to the lord deputy, as to his dealings\r\nwith those people. He complains of his ill success in the prosecution\r\nof the wood-kerne. He had done his best, and all had turned to\r\nnothing. When the news of the plantation came, he had no hope at all,\r\nfor the people then said it would be many of their cases to become\r\nwood-kerne themselves out of necessity, 'no other means being left for\r\nthem to keep being in this world than to live as long as they could\r\nby scrambling.' They hoped, however, that so much of the summer being\r\nspent before the commissioners came down, 'so great cruelty would not\r\nbe showed as to remove them upon the edge of winter from their\r\nhouses, and in the very season when they were employed in making their\r\nharvest. They held discourse among themselves, that if this course had\r\nbeen taken with them in war time, it had had some colour of justice;\r\nbut being pardoned, and their land given them, and they having lived\r\nunder law ever since, and being ready to submit themselves to the\r\nmercy of the law, for any offence they can be charged withal, since\r\ntheir pardoning, they conclude it to be the greatest cruelty that was\r\never inflicted upon any people.'\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that Sir Toby was obliged to add to his report this\r\nassurance: 'There is not a more discontented people in Christendom.'\r\nIt is difficult to conceive how any people in Christendom could be\r\ncontented, treated as they were, according to this account, which the\r\nofficer of the Government did not deny; for surely no people, in any\r\nChristian country, were ever the victims of such flagrant injustice,\r\ninflicted by a Government which promised to relieve them from the\r\ncruel exactions of their barbarous chiefs--a Government, too, solemnly\r\npledged to protect them in the unmolested enjoyment of their houses\r\nand lands. How little this policy tended to strengthen the Government\r\nappears from a confession made about the same time by the lord deputy\r\nhimself. He wrote: 'The hearts of the Irish are against us: we have\r\nonly a handful of men in entertainment so ill paid, that everyone is\r\nout of heart, and our resources so discredited, by borrowing and\r\nnot repaying, that we cannot take up 1,000 l. in twenty days, if the\r\nsafety of the kingdom depended upon it. The Irish are hopeful of the\r\nreturn of the fugitives, or invasion from foreign parts.'\r\n\r\nBut the safety of England, do what she might in the way of oppression,\r\nlay then, as it lay often since, and ever will lie, in the tendency\r\nto division, and the instability of the Celtic character. The Rev. Mr.\r\nMeehan, with all his zeal for Irish nationality, admits this failing\r\nof the people with his usual candour. He says: 'These traits, so\r\npeculiar to the Celtic character, have been justly stigmatised by a\r\nfriendly and observant Italian (the Nuncio Rinuccini) who, some thirty\r\nyears after the period of which we are writing, tells us that the\r\nnative Irish were behind the rest of Europe in the knowledge of\r\nthose things that tended to their material improvement--indifferent\r\nagriculturists, living from hand to mouth--caring more for the sword\r\nthan the plough--good Catholics, though by nature barbarous--and\r\nplacing their hopes of deliverance from English rule on foreign\r\nintervention. For this they were constantly straining their eyes\r\ntowards France or Spain, and, no matter whence the ally came, were\r\never ready to rise in revolt. One virtue, however--intensest love of\r\ncountry--more or less redeemed these vices, for so they deserve to be\r\ncalled; but to establish anything like strict military discipline\r\nor organisation among themselves, it must be avowed they had no\r\naptitude.' This, says Mr. Meehan, 'to some extent, will account for\r\nthe apathy of the Northern Catholics, while the undertakers were\r\ncarrying on the gigantic eviction known as the plantation of Ulster;\r\nfor, since Sir Cahir O'Dogherty's rebellion till 1615, there was only\r\none attempt to resist the intruders, an abortive raid on the city of\r\nDerry, for which the meagre annals of that year tell us, six of the\r\nEarl of Tyrone's nearest kinsmen were put to death. Withal the people\r\nof Ulster were full of hope that O'Neill would return with forces to\r\nevict the evicters, but the farther they advanced into this agreeable\r\nperspective, the more rapidly did its charms disappear.\r\n\r\nThe proclamations against wood-kerne present a curious picture of\r\nthese 'plantation' times. The lord deputy, in council, understood\r\nthat 'many idle kerne, loose and masterless men, and other disordered\r\npersons, did range up and down in sundry parts of this kingdom, being\r\narmed with swords, targets, pikes, shot, head-pieces, horsemen's\r\nstaves, and other warlike weapons, to the great terror of his\r\nmajesty's well-disposed subjects, upon whom they had committed many\r\nextortions, murders, robberies, and other outrages. Hence divers\r\nproclamations had been published in his majesty's name, commanding\r\nthat no person of what condition soever, travelling on horseback,\r\nshould presume to carry more arms than one sword or rapier and dagger;\r\nand that no person travelling on foot should carry any weapons at all.\r\nTwenty days were allowed for giving the arms to the proper officers.\r\nIf the proclamation was not obeyed within that time, the arms were\r\nto be seized for the king's use, and the bearers of them committed to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 1609, a commission was issued by the crown to make\r\ninquisition concerning the forfeited lands in Ulster after the flight\r\nof the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel. The commissioners included the\r\nLord-Deputy Chichester, the Archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, Sir John\r\nDavis, attorney-general; Sir William Parsons, surveyor-general, and\r\nseveral other public functionaries. This work done, King James, acting\r\non the advice of his prime minister, the Earl of Salisbury, took\r\nmeasures for the plantation of Ulster, a project earnestly recommended\r\nby statesmen connected with Ireland, and for which the flight of\r\nO'Neill and O'Donel furnished the desired opportunity. The city of\r\nLondon was thought to be the best quarter to look to for funds to\r\ncarry on the plantation. Accordingly, Lord Salisbury had a conference\r\nwith the lord mayor, Humphry Weld, Sir John Jolles, and Sir W.\r\nCockaine, who were well acquainted with Irish affairs. The result was\r\nthe publication of 'Motives and Reasons to induce the City of London\r\nto undertake the Plantation in the North of Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThe inducements were of the most tempting character. It is customary\r\nto speak of Ulster, before the plantation, as something like a desert,\r\nout of which the planters created an Eden. But the picture presented\r\nto the Londoners was more like the land which the Israelitish spies\r\nfound beyond Jordan--a land flowing with milk and honey. Among\r\n'the land commodities which the North of Ireland produceth' were\r\nthese:--the country was well watered generally by abundance of\r\nsprings, brooks, and rivers. There was plenty of fuel--either wood,\r\nor 'good and wholesome turf.' The land yielded 'store of all necessary\r\nfor man's sustenance, in such a measure as may not only maintain\r\nitself, but also furnish the city of London yearly with manifold\r\nprovision, especially for their fleets--namely, with beef, pork, fish,\r\nrye, bere, peas, and beans.' It was not only fit for all sorts of\r\nhusbandry, but it excelled for the breeding of mares and the increase\r\nof cattle; whence the Londoners might expect 'plenty of butter,\r\ncheese, hides, and tallow,' while English sheep would breed abundantly\r\nthere. It was also held to be good in many places for madder, hops,\r\nand woad. It afforded 'fells of all sorts in great quantity, red deer,\r\nfoxes, sheep, lambs, rabbits, martins and squirrels,' &c. Hemp and\r\nflax grew more naturally there than elsewhere, which, being well\r\nregarded, would give provision for canvas, cables, cording, besides\r\nthread, linen cloth, and all stuffs made of linen yarn, 'which are\r\nmore fine and plentiful there than in all the rest of the kingdom.'\r\nThen there were the best materials of all sorts for building, with\r\n'the goodliest and largest timber, that might compare with any in his\r\nmajesty's dominions;' and, moreover, the country was 'very plentiful\r\nin honey and wax.'\r\n\r\nThe sea and the rivers vied with the land in the richness of their\r\nproduce. 'The sea fishing of that coast was very plentiful of all\r\nmanner of usual sea fish--there being yearly, after Michaelmas, for\r\ntaking of herrings, above seven or eight score sail of his majesty's\r\nsubjects and strangers for lading, besides an infinite number of boats\r\nfor fishing and killing.'\r\n\r\nThe corporation were willing to undertake the work of plantation if\r\nthe account given of its advantages should prove to be correct.\r\nWith the caution of men of business, they wished to put the glowing\r\nrepresentations of the Government to the test of an investigation by\r\nagents of their own. So they sent over 'four wise, grave, and discreet\r\ncitizens, to view the situation proposed for the new colony.' The men\r\nselected were John Broad, goldsmith; Robert Treswell, painter-stainer;\r\nJohn Rowley, draper; and John Munns, mercer. On their return from\r\ntheir Irish mission they presented a report to the Court of Common\r\nCouncil, which was openly read. The report was favourable. A company\r\nwas to be formed in London for conducting the plantation. Corporations\r\nwere to be founded in Derry and Coleraine, everything concerning\r\nthe colony to be managed and performed in Ireland by the advice and\r\ndirection of the company in London. It was agreed between the Privy\r\nCouncil and the City that the sum of 20,000 l. should be levied,\r\n15,000 l. for the intended plantation, and 5,000 l. 'for the clearing\r\nof private men's interest in the things demanded.' That 200 houses\r\nshould be built in Derry, and room left for 300 more. 'That 4,000\r\nacres lying on the Derry side, next adjacent to the wherry, should be\r\nlaid thereunto--bog and barren mountain to be no part thereof, but\r\nto go as waste for the city; the same to be done by indifferent\r\ncommissioners.'\r\n\r\nThe royal charters and letters clearly set forth the objects of the\r\nplantation. James I., in the preamble of the charter to the town of\r\nColeraine, thus described his intentions in disposing of the forfeited\r\nlands to English undertakers: 'Whereas there can be nothing more\r\nworthy of a king to perform than to establish the true religion of\r\nChrist among men hitherto depraved and almost lost in superstition;\r\nto improve and cultivate by art and industry countries and lands\r\nuncultivated and almost desert, and not only to stock them with\r\nhonest citizens and inhabitants, but also to strengthen them with\r\ngood institutions and ordinances, whereby they might be more safely\r\ndefended not only from the corruption of their morals but from their\r\nintestine and domestic plots and conspiracies, and also from foreign\r\nviolence: And whereas the province of Ulster in our realm of Ireland,\r\nfor many years past, hath grossly erred from the true religion of\r\nChrist and divine grace, and hath abounded with superstition, insomuch\r\nthat for a long time it hath not only been harassed, torn, and wasted\r\nby private and domestic broils but also by foreign arms: We therefore,\r\ndeeply and heartily commiserating the wretched state of the said\r\nprovince, have esteemed it to be a work worthy of a Christian prince,\r\nand of our royal office, to stir up and recal the same province from\r\nsuperstition, rebellion, calamity, and poverty, which heretofore\r\nhave horribly raged therein, to religion, obedience, strength, and\r\nprosperity. And whereas our beloved and faithful subjects the mayor\r\nand commonalty and citizens of our city of London, burning with a\r\nflagrant zeal to promote such our pious intention in this behalf, have\r\nundertaken a considerable part of the said plantation in Ulster, and\r\nare making progress therein'.\r\n\r\nKing James, having heard very unsatisfactory reports of the progress\r\nof the plantation, wrote a letter to the lord deputy in 1612,\r\nstrongly complaining of the neglect of the 'Londoners' to fulfil the\r\nobligations they had voluntarily undertaken. He had made 'liberal\r\ndonations of great proportions of those lands to divers British\r\nundertakers and servitors, with favourable tenures and reservations\r\nfor their better encouragement; but hitherto neither the safety of\r\nthat country, nor the planting of religion and civility among those\r\nrude and barbarous people, which were the principal motives of that\r\nproject, and which he expected as the only fruits and returns of\r\nhis bounty, had been as yet any whit materially effected. He was not\r\nignorant how much the real accomplishment of the plantation concerned\r\nthe future peace and safety of that kingdom; but if there was no\r\nreason of state to press it forward, he would yet pursue and effect\r\nthat object with the same earnestness, 'merely for the goodness and\r\nmorality of it; esteeming the settling of religion, the introducing\r\nof civility, order, and government among a barbarous and unsubjected\r\npeople, to be acts of piety and glory, and worthy also a Christian\r\nprince to endeavour.'\r\n\r\nThe king therefore ordered that there should be a strict inquiry into\r\nthe work done, because 'the Londoners pretended the expense of great\r\nsums of money in that service, and yet the outward appearance of it\r\nwas very small.' The lord deputy was solemnly charged to give him\r\na faithful account without care or fear to displease any of his\r\nsubjects, English or Scottish, of what quality soever.'\r\n\r\nSir Josias Bodley was the commissioner appointed for this purpose. He\r\nreported very unfavourably, in consequence of which his majesty\r\ncalled upon the Irish society and the several companies to give him an\r\naccount of their stewardship. He also wrote again to the lord deputy\r\nin 1615. The language the king uses is remarkable, as proving the\r\n_trusteeship_ of the companies. Referring to Bodley's report he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'We have examined, viewed, and reviewed, with our own eye, every part\r\nthereof, and find greatly to our discontentment the slow progression\r\nof that plantation; some few only of our British undertakers,\r\nservitors, and natives having as yet proceeded effectually by the\r\naccomplishment of such things in all points as are required of them\r\nby the articles of the plantation; the rest, and by much the greatest\r\npart, having either done nothing at all, or so little, or, by reason\r\nof the slightness thereof, to so little purpose, that the work seems\r\nrather to us to be forgotten by them, and to perish under their hand,\r\nthan any whit to be advanced by them; some having begun to build and\r\nnot planted, others begun to plant and not built, and all of them, in\r\ngeneral, retaining the Irish still upon their lands, the avoiding of\r\nwhich was the fundamental reason of that plantation. We have made\r\na collection of their names, as we found their endeavours and\r\nnegligences noted in the service, which we will retain as a memorial\r\nwith us, and they shall be sure to feel the effects of our favour and\r\ndisfavour, as there shall be occasion. It is well known to you that\r\nif we had intended only (as it seems most of them over-greedily\r\nhave done) our present profit, we might have converted those large\r\nterritories to our escheated lands, to the great improvement of the\r\nrevenue of our crown there; but we chose rather, for the safety of\r\nthat country and the civilizing of that people, to part with the\r\ninheritance of them at extreme undervalues, and to make a plantation\r\nof them; and since we were merely induced thereunto out of reason of\r\nstate, we think we may without any breach of justice make bold with\r\ntheir rights who have neglected their duties in a service of so much\r\nimportance unto us, and by the same law and reason of state resume\r\ninto our hands their lands who have failed to perform, according to\r\nour original intention, the articles of plantation, and bestow them\r\nupon some other men more active and worthy of them than themselves:\r\nand the time is long since expired within which they were bound to\r\nhave finished to all purposes their plantation, so that we want not\r\njust provocation to proceed presently with all rigour against them.'\r\n\r\nHe gave them a year to pull up their arrears of work, and in\r\nconclusion said to Chichester: 'My lord, in this service I expect that\r\nzeal and uprightness from you, that you will spare no flesh, English\r\nor Scottish; for no private man's worth is able to counterbalance\r\nthe particular safety of a kingdom, which this plantation, well\r\naccomplished, will procure.'\r\n\r\nTwo or three years later, Captain Pynnar was sent to survey the lands\r\nthat had been granted to the undertakers, and to report upon the\r\nimprovements they had effected. A few notices from his report will\r\ngive an idea of the state of Ulster at the commencement of this great\r\nsocial revolution:--\r\n\r\nArmagh was one of the six counties confiscated by James I. The\r\nterritory had belonged to the O'Neills, the O'Hanlons, the O'Carrols,\r\nand M'Kanes, whose people were all involved more or less in the\r\nfortunes of the Earl of Tyrone, who wielded sovereign power over this\r\nportion of Ulster. The plantation scheme was said to be the work of\r\nthe Privy Council of Ireland, and submitted by them for the adoption\r\nof the English Government. It was part of the plan that all the lands\r\nescheated in each county should be divided into four parts, whereof\r\ntwo should be subdivided into proportions consisting of about 1,000\r\nacres a piece; a third part into proportions of 1,500 acres; and the\r\nfourth in proportions of 2,000 acres. Every proportion was to be made\r\ninto a parish, a church was to be erected on it, and the minister\r\nendowed with glebe land. If an incumbent of a parish of 1,000 acres he\r\nwas to have sixty; if of 1,500 acres, ninety; and if 2,000 acres, he\r\nwas to have 120 acres; and the whole tithes and duties of every\r\nparish should be allotted to the incumbent as well as the glebe. The\r\nundertakers were to be of several sorts. 1st, English and Scotch, who\r\nwere to plant their proportions with English and Scotch tenants; 2nd,\r\nservitors in Ireland, who might take English or Scotch tenants at\r\ntheir choice; 3rd, natives of the county, who were to be freeholders.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the disposal of the natives, it was arranged that the\r\nsame course should be adopted as in the county of Tyrone, which was\r\nthis: some were to be planted upon two of the small proportions, and\r\nupon the glebes; others upon the land of Sir Art O'Neill's sons and\r\nSir Henry Oge O'Neill's sons, 'and of such other Irish as shall be\r\nthought fit to have any _freeholds_; some others upon the portions of\r\nsuch servitors as are not able to inhabit these lands with English or\r\nScotch tenants, especially of _such as best know how to rule and\r\norder the Irish_. But the swordsmen (that is, the armed retainers or\r\nsoldiers of the chiefs) are to be transplanted into such other parts\r\nof the kingdom as, by reason of the wastes therein, are fittest to\r\nreceive them, namely, into Connaught and some parts of Munster, where\r\nthey are to be dispersed, and not planted together in one place; and\r\nsuch swordsmen, who have not followers or cattle of their own, to be\r\ndisposed of in his majesty's service.' This provision about planting\r\nthe swordsmen, however, was not carried out. The whole county of\r\nArmagh was found to contain 77,300 acres of arable and pasture land,\r\nwhich would make 60 proportions. That county, as well as other parts\r\nof ancient Ireland, was divided into ballyboes, or townlands, tracts\r\nof tillage land surrounding the native villages unenclosed, and held\r\nin _rundale_, having ranges of pasture for their cattle, which were\r\nherded in common, each owner being entitled to a certain number of\r\n'collops' in proportion to his arable land. As these ballyboes were\r\nnot of equal extent, the English made the division of land by acres,\r\nand erected boundary fences.\r\n\r\nThe primate's share in this county was 2,400 acres. The glebes\r\ncomprised 4,650 acres; the College of Dublin got 1,200, and the Free\r\nSchool at Armagh 720; Sir Turlough M'Henry possessed 9,900 acres,\r\nand 4,900 had been granted to Sir Henry Oge O'Neill. After these\r\ndeductions, there were for the undertakers 55,620 acres, making in all\r\nforty-two proportions.\r\n\r\nNumber one in the survey is the estate of William Brownlow, Esq.,\r\nwhich contained two proportions, making together 2,500 acres. Pynar\r\nreported as follows: 'Upon the proportion of Ballenemony there is a\r\nstrong stone house within a good island; and at Dowcoran there is a\r\nvery fair house of stone and brick, with good lyme, and hath a strong\r\nbawne of timber and earth with a pallizado about it. There is now laid\r\nin readiness both lyme and stone, to make a bawne thereof, the which\r\nis promised to be done this summer. He hath made a very fair town,\r\nconsisting of forty-two houses, all which are inhabited with\r\nEnglish families, and the streets all paved clean through; also two\r\nwater-mills and a wind-mill, all for corn, and he hath store of arms\r\nin his house.'\r\n\r\nPynar found 'planted and estated' on this territory 57 families\r\naltogether, who were able to furnish 100 men with arms, there not\r\nbeing one Irish family upon all the land. There was, however, a number\r\nof sub-tenants, which accounts for the fact that there was 'good store\r\nof tillage.' Five of the English settlers were freeholders, having 120\r\nacres each; and there were 52 leaseholders, whose farms varied in size\r\nfrom 420 acres to 5; six of them holding 100 acres and upwards. This\r\nwas the foundation of the flourishing town of Lurgan.\r\n\r\nMr. Obens had 2,000 acres obtained from William Powell, the first\r\npatentee. He had built a bawne of sods with a pallizado of boards\r\nditched about. Within this there was a 'good fair house of brick and\r\nlyme,' and near it he had built four houses, inhabited by English\r\nfamilies. There were twenty settlers, who with their under-tenants\r\nwere able to furnish forty-six armed men. This was the beginning of\r\nPortadown.\r\n\r\nThe fourth lot was obtained from the first patentee by Mr. Cope, who\r\nhad 3,000 acres. 'He built a bawne of lyme and stone 180 feet square,\r\n14 feet high, with four flankers; and in three of them he had built\r\nvery good lodgings, which were three stories high.' He erected\r\ntwo water-mills and one wind-mill, and near the bawne he had built\r\nfourteen houses of timber, which were inhabited by English families.\r\nThis is now the rich district of Lough Gall.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed here that, in all these crown grants, the\r\npatentees were charged crown rents only for the _arable_ lands\r\nconveyed by their title-deeds, bogs, wastes, mountain, and unreclaimed\r\nlands of every description being thrown in gratuitously; amounting\r\nprobably to ten or fifteen times the quantity of demised ground set\r\ndown in acres. Lord Lurgan's agent, Mr. Hancock, at the commencement\r\nof his evidence before the Devon Commission, stated that 'Lord Lurgan\r\nis owner of about 24,600 acres, with a population of 23,800, under the\r\ncensus of 1841'--that is, by means of original reclamation, drainage,\r\nand other works of agricultural improvement, Mr. Brownlow's 2,500\r\nacres of the year 1619, had silently grown up to 24,600 acres, and\r\nhis hundred swordsmen, or pikemen, the representatives of 57 families,\r\nwith a few subordinates, had multiplied to 23,800 souls. Now Mr.\r\nHancock founds the tenant-right custom upon the fact that few, if any,\r\nof the 'patentees were wealthy;' we may therefore fairly presume that\r\nthe _settlers built their own houses, and made their own improvements\r\nat their own expense_, contrary to the English practice.' As the\r\npopulation increased, and 'arable' land became valuable, bogs, wastes,\r\nand barren land were gradually reclaimed and cultivated, through\r\nthe hard labour and at the cost of the occupying tenantry, until the\r\npossessions of his descendants have spread over ten times the area\r\nnominally demised by the crown to their progenitor. This process went\r\non all over the province.\r\n\r\nSixteen years passed away, and in the opinion of the Government the\r\nLondon companies and the Irish Society, instead of reforming as Irish\r\nplanters, went on from bad to worse. Accordingly, in 1631, Charles I.\r\nfound it necessary to bring them into the Star Chamber. In a letter to\r\nthe lords justices he said:--\r\n\r\n'Our father, of blessed memory, in his wisdom and singular care,\r\nboth to fortify and preserve that country of Ireland from foreign and\r\ninward forces, and also for the better establishment of true religion,\r\njustice, civility, and commerce, found it most necessary to erect\r\nBritish plantations there; and, to that end, ordained and published\r\nmany politic and good orders, and for the encouragement of planters\r\ngave them large proportions and privileges. Above the rest, his grace\r\nand favour was most enlarged to the Londoners, who undertook the\r\nplantation of a considerable part of Ulster, and were specially\r\nchosen for their ability and professed zeal to public works; and yet\r\nadvertisements have been given from time to time, not only by private\r\nmen, but by all succeeding deputies, and by commissioners sent from\r\nhence and chosen there, and being many of them of our council, that\r\nthe _Londoners for private lucre_ have broken and neglected both their\r\ngeneral printed ordinances and other particular directions given by us\r\nand our council here, so as if they hall escape unpunished all others\r\nwill be heartened to do the like, and in the end expose that our\r\nkingdom to former confusions and dangers; for prevention whereof we\r\nhave, upon mature advice of our councillors for those causes, caused\r\nthem to be questioned in our high court of Star-chamber here, whence\r\ncommission is now sent to examine witnesses, upon interrogatories, for\r\ndiscovery of the truth; and because we understand that the Londoners\r\nheretofore prevailed with some, from whom we expected better service,\r\nthat in the return of the last commission many things agreed under the\r\nhands of most commissioners were not accordingly certified: Now that\r\nour service may not surfer by like partiality, we will and require\r\nyou to have an especial eye to this business; and take care that this\r\ncommission be faithfully executed, and that no practice or indirect\r\nmeans be used, either to delay the return or to frustrate the ends of\r\ntruth in every interrogatory.'\r\n\r\nThis proceeding on the part of the crown was ascribed to the influence\r\nof Bishop Bramhall, who had come over with Lord Strafford as his\r\nchaplain. The result was, that in 1632 the whole county of Londonderry\r\nwas sequestrated, and the rents levied for the king's use, the Bishop\r\nof Derry being appointed receiver and authorised to make leases. The\r\nlord chancellor, with the concurrence of the other judges, decreed\r\nthat the letters patent should be surrendered and cancelled. This\r\ndecree was duly executed.\r\n\r\nCromwell reinstated the companies in their possessions, and Charles\r\nII., instead of reversing the forfeiture, granted a new charter. This\r\ncharter founded a system of protection and corporate exclusiveness,\r\nthe most perfect perhaps that ever existed in the three kingdoms.\r\nHe began by constituting Londonderry a county, and Derry city a\r\ncorporation--to be called Londonderry. He named the aldermen and\r\nburgesses, who were to hold their offices during their natural lives.\r\nHe placed both the county and city under the control of 'the Irish\r\nSociety,' which was then definitely formed. He appointed Sir Thomas\r\nAdams first governor, and John Saunders, deputy governor. He also\r\nappointed the twenty-four assistants, all citizens of London. He\r\ninvested the society with full power 'to send orders and directions\r\nfrom, this kingdom of England into the said realm of Ireland, by\r\nletters or otherwise, for the ordering, directing, and disposing of\r\nall and all manner of matters and things whatsoever of and concerning\r\nthe same plantation, or the disposition or government thereof. The\r\ngrant of property was most comprehensive:--\r\n\r\n'We also will, and, by these presents for us, our heirs and\r\nsuccessors, do give, grant, and confirm to the said society of the\r\ngovernor and assistants [London] of the new plantation in Ulster\r\nwithin the realm of Ireland, and their successors: 'All that the city,\r\nfort, and town of Derry, and all edifices and structures thereof, with\r\nthe appurtenances, in the county of the city of Derry aforesaid, in\r\nthe province of Ulster, in our realm of Ireland; and also the whole\r\nisland of Derry, with the appurtenances, and all lands and the whole\r\nground within the island of Derry aforesaid, in the said county of the\r\ncity of Derry, otherwise Londonderry, within the province of Ulster,\r\nin our aforesaid realm of Ireland. And also all those lands next\r\nadjacent to the said city or town of Derry, lying and being on or\r\ntowards the west part of the river of Loughfoyle, containing by\r\nestimation four thousand acres, besides bog and barren mountains,\r\nwhich said bog and barren mountains may be had and used as waste to\r\nthe same city belonging. And also all that portion and proportion\r\nof land by the general survey of all the lands in the aforesaid late\r\ncounty of Coleraine, now Londonderry, heretofore taken, called the\r\ngreat proportion of Boughtbegg, lying and being in the barony or\r\nprecinct of Coleraine, now Londonderry, within the province of Ulster\r\naforesaid, in our said realm of Ireland; that is to say, all lands,\r\ntenements, and other hereditaments, called and known by the names, and\r\nsituate, lying, and being in or within the several towns, villages,\r\nhamlets, places, balliboes, or parcels of land following, that is to\r\nsay: Hacketbegg, being two balliboes of land; Aglakightagh, being two\r\nballiboes of land; Altybryan, being one balliboe of land; Bratbooly,\r\nbeing one balliboe of land; Hackmoore, being one balliboe of land;\r\nTirecurrin, being one balliboe of land; Edermale, being one balliboe\r\nof land; Lennagorran, being one balliboe of land; Knockmult, being one\r\nballiboe of land; Boughtmore, being one balliboe of land; Boughtbegg,\r\nbeing one balliboe of land, &c.\r\n\r\n'We will also, and by these presents for us, our heirs and successors,\r\ndo grant and confirm to the said society of the governor and\r\nassistants [London] of the new plantation in Ulster, and their\r\nsuccessors, that they and their successors, and also all their\r\nassigns, deputies, ministers, and servants shall and may have full\r\nliberty of fishing, hawking, and fowling in all the places, tenements,\r\nshores, and coasts aforesaid, at their will and pleasure.\r\n\r\n'And that it shall and may be lawful to and for them and every of them\r\nto draw and dry their nets, and pack the fishes there taken upon any\r\npart of the shores and coasts aforesaid where they shall fish; and\r\nthe salmons and other fishes there taken to take thence and carry away\r\nwithout any impediment, contradiction, or molestation of us or others\r\nwhomsoever, wheresoever it shall happen to be done.\r\n\r\n'And that in like manner they may have the several fishings and\r\nfowlings within the city of Londonderry aforesaid, and in all lands\r\nand tenements before mentioned to be granted and confirmed to the said\r\nsociety of the governor and assistants [London] of the new plantation\r\nin Ulster and their successors, and in the river and water of\r\nLoughfoile, to the ebb of the sea, and in the river or water of Bann\r\nto Loughneagh.'\r\n\r\nThe grants were made without any reservation in favour of the tenants\r\nor the old inhabitants, saving some portions of land given by letters\r\npatent by his grandfather to 'certain _Irish gentlemen_ in the said\r\ncounty of Londonderry, heretofore inhabiting and residing, and who\r\nwere heretofore made freeholders, and their successors, under a small\r\nyearly rent,' which was to be paid to the Irish Society. Even the\r\nIrish gentlemen were not allowed to hold their ancient inheritance\r\ndirectly under the crown. I am informed that there is but one Roman\r\nCatholic landed gentleman now remaining in the whole province of\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nThe Londoners had extraordinary privileges as traders. They had free\r\nquarters in every port throughout the kingdom, while they treated all\r\nbut the members of their own body as 'foreigners.' They knew nothing\r\nof reciprocity:--'And further we will, and, by these presents for us,\r\nour heirs and successors, do grant and confirm to the said mayor and\r\ncommonalty and citizens of our city of Londonderry aforesaid, that all\r\ncitizens of the said city of Londonderry and liberty of the same (as\r\nmuch as in us is) be for ever quit and free, and all their things\r\nthroughout all Ireland, of all tolls, wharfage, murage, anchorage,\r\nbeaconage, pavage, pontage, piccage, stallage, passage, and lestage,\r\nand of all other tolls and duties.'\r\n\r\nThe 'foreigners,' including all his majesty's subjects but the\r\nfavoured few within the walls of Derry, were forbidden to buy or sell,\r\nor practise any trade in this sanctuary of freedom and head-centre\r\nof 'civility.' 'And that merchants and others which are not of the\r\nfreedom of the city of Londonderry aforesaid shall not sell by\r\nretail any wines or other wares whatsoever within the same city of\r\nLondonderry, the suburbs, liberties, or franchises of the same, upon\r\npain of forfeiture for the things so bought, or the value thereof,\r\nto the use of the mayor and commonalty and citizens of the city of\r\nLondonderry aforesaid. And also that no person being a foreigner from\r\nthe freedom of the city aforesaid shall use or exercise within the\r\nsame city, liberties or suburbs of the same, any art, mystery, or\r\nmanual occupation whatsoever, to make his gain and profit thereof,\r\nupon pain of forfeiture of forty shillings for every time wherein\r\nsuch person shall use or exercise within the said city of Londonderry,\r\nliberties, and suburbs of the same, any art, mystery, or manual\r\noccupation as aforesaid.'\r\n\r\nForeigners were not allowed to buy from or sell to foreigners, and\r\nthere was to be no market for the accommodation of the unprivileged\r\ninhabitants within seven miles of the city.\r\n\r\nSimilar exclusive privileges were conferred upon the corporation of\r\nColeraine. Such was the system established by the City of London in\r\nits model communities in Ireland--normal schools of freedom, fountains\r\nof civilising and Christianising influences which were to reclaim and\r\nconvert the barbarous and superstitious natives into loyal subjects\r\nand enlightened Protestants! What the natives beheld in Londonderry\r\nwas, in fact, a royal organisation of selfishness, bigotry, and\r\nmonopoly, of the most intensely exclusive and repulsive character. In\r\none sense the Londoners in Derry showed that they peculiarly prized\r\nthe blessings of civilisation, for they kept them all to themselves.\r\nThe fountain was flowing in the most tempting manner before the\r\nthirsty Irish, but let them dare to drink of it at their peril! A fine\r\nwhich no Irishman was then able to pay must be the penalty for every\r\nattempt at civilisation!\r\n\r\nThe representatives of Derry and Coleraine were not only elected\r\nwithout cost, but paid for their attendance in Parliament.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the greatest possible care was taken to\r\nkeep out the Irish. The society, in 1615, sent precepts to all the\r\ncompanies requiring each of them to send one or two artisans, with\r\ntheir families, into Ulster, to settle there; and directions were also\r\ngiven, in order that Derry might not in future be peopled with Irish,\r\nthat twelve Christ's Hospital and other poor children should be sent\r\nthere as apprentices and servants, and the inhabitants were to be\r\nprohibited from taking Irish apprentices. Directions were also given\r\nto the companies, to repair the churches on their several proportions,\r\nand furnish the ministers with a bible, common-prayer book, and a\r\ncommunion cup. The trades which the society recommended as proper to\r\nintroduce into Ulster were, weavers of common cloth, fustians, and\r\nnew stuffs, felt-makers and trimmers of hats, and hat-band makers,\r\nlocksmiths and farriers, tanners and fellmongers, iron makers,\r\nglass-makers, pewterers, coast fishermen, turners, basket-makers,\r\ntallow-chandlers, dyers, and curriers.\r\n\r\nThe Christ's Hospital children arrived safe, and became the precious\r\nseed of the 'prentice boys.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 the following return was made of the total disbursements by\r\nthe Londoners in Derry from January 2, 1609, to this year:--\r\n\r\n                                                           £\r\nFor 77-1/2 houses at 140 l. a house                      10,850\r\nFor 33 houses at 80 l. a house                            2,680\r\nFor the Lord Bishop's house                                 500\r\nFor the walls and fortifications                          8,357\r\nFor digging the ditch and filling earth for the rampire   1,500\r\nFor levelling earth to lay the rampire                      500\r\nFor building a faggot quay at the water-gate                100\r\nFor two quays at the lime kilns                              10\r\nFor the building of the town house                          500\r\nFor the quays at the ferry                                   60\r\nFor carriage and mounting the ordnance                       40\r\nFor arms                                                    558\r\nFor a guardhouse                                             50\r\nFor the platforms for bulwarks                              300\r\nFor some work done at the old church                         40\r\nFor some work done at the town pike                           6\r\nFor sinking 22 cellars, and sundry of the houses not\r\ndone at first, at 20 s. cellar, one with another            440\r\nFor the building of lime kilns                              120\r\n                                                         ______\r\n                                                         26,611\r\n                                                         ______\r\nSum total, as given in the Commissioners' account        27,197\r\n\r\nThe exclusive and protective system utterly failed to accomplish its\r\npurpose in keeping out the Irish.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Phillips made a muster-roll in 1622, in which he gives\r\n110 as the number of settlers in the city of Derry capable of bearing\r\narms. There are but two Irish names in the list--Ermine M'Swine, and\r\nJames Doherty. The first, from his Christian name, seemed to have\r\nbeen of mixed blood, the son of a judge, which would account for\r\nhis orthodoxy. But his presence might have reminded the citizens\r\nunpleasantly of the Irish battle-axes. Never were greater pains taken\r\nto keep a community pure than within the sacred precincts of the\r\nDerry walls; and never was Protestantism more tenderly fostered by\r\nthe state--so far as secular advantages could do it. The natives\r\nwere treated as 'foreigners.' No trade was permitted except by the\r\nchartered British. They were free of tolls all over the land, and for\r\ntheir sake restrictions were placed on everybody that could in any way\r\ninterfere with their worldly interests. So complete was the system\r\nof exclusion kept up by the English Government and the London\r\ncorporation, in this grand experiment for planting religion and\r\ncivility among a barbarous people, that, so late as the year 1708,\r\nthe Derry corporation considered itself nothing more or less than _a\r\nbranch of the City of London_! In that year they sent an address to\r\nthe Irish Society, to be presented through them to the queen. 'In this\r\naddress they stated themselves to be a branch of the City of London.\r\nThe secretary was ordered to wait upon the lord lieutenant of Ireland\r\nwith the address and entreat the favour of his lordship's advice\r\nconcerning the presenting of the same to her majesty.' A few days\r\nafter it was announced that the address had been graciously received,\r\nand published in the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were kept out of the enclosed part of the city till a late\r\nperiod. In the memory of the present generation there was no Catholic\r\nhouse within the walls, and I believe it is not much longer since\r\nthe Catholic servants within the sacred enclosure were obliged to go\r\noutside at night to sleep among their kinsfolk. The English garrison\r\ndid not multiply very fast. In 1626 there were only 109 families\r\nin the city, of which five were families of soldiers liable to\r\nbe removed. Archbishop King stated that in 1690 the whole of the\r\npopulation of the parish, including the Donegal part, was about 700.\r\n\r\nBut the irrepressible Irish increased and multiplied around the walls\r\nwith alarming rapidity. The tide of native population rose steadily\r\nagainst the ramparts of exclusion, and could no more be kept back than\r\nthe tide in the Foyle. In the general census of 1800 there were no\r\nreturns from Derry. But in 1814 it was stated in a report by the\r\ndeputation from the Irish Society, that the population amounted at\r\nthat time to 14,087 persons. This must have included the suburbs. In\r\nthe census of 1821 the city was found to have 9,313 inhabitants. The\r\ncity and suburbs together contained 16,971.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners of public instruction in 1831 made a\r\nstartling disclosure as to the effect of the system of exclusion in\r\nthis 'branch of the City of London.' In the parish of Templemore (part\r\nof) there were--\r\n\r\nMembers of the Established Church        3,166\r\nPresbyterians                            5,811\r\nRoman Catholics                          9,838\r\n\r\nThe report of 1834 gave the Roman Catholics, 10,299; the\r\nPresbyterians, 6,083; and the Church only 3,314.\r\n\r\nThe figures now are--Catholics          12,036\r\nProtestants of all denominations         8,839\r\nMajority of Irish and Catholics in this\r\n'branch of the City of London'           3,197\r\n\r\nThis majority is about equal to the whole number which the exclusive\r\nsystem, with all its 'protection' and 'bounties,' could produce for\r\nthe Established Church in the course of two centuries! If the Irish\r\nhad been admitted to the Pale of English civilisation, and instructed\r\nin the industrial arts by the settlers, the results with respect to\r\nreligion might have been very different. In the long run the Church\r\nof Rome has been the greatest gainer by coercion. Derry has been a\r\nminiature representation of the Establishment. The 'prentice boys,\r\nlike their betters, must yield to the spirit of the age, and submit\r\nwith the best grace they can to the rule of religious equality.\r\n\r\nThe plantation was, however, wonderfully successful on the whole. In\r\nthirty years, towns, fortresses, factories, arose, pastures, ploughed\r\nup, were converted into broad corn-fields, orchards, gardens, hedges,\r\n&c. were planted. How did this happen? 'The answer is that it sprang\r\nfrom the security of tenure which the plantation settlement supplied.\r\nThe landlords were in every case bound to make fixed estates to their\r\ntenants at the risk of sequestration and forfeiture. Hence their\r\npower of selling their plantation rights and improvements. This is the\r\norigin of Ulster tenant-right.'\r\n\r\nYet the work went on slowly enough in some districts. The viceroy,\r\nChichester, was not neglected in the distribution of the spoils. He\r\nnot only got the O'Dogherty's country, Innishown, but a large tract in\r\nAntrim, including the towns of Carrickfergus and Belfast. An English\r\ntourist travelling that way in 1635 gives a quaint description of the\r\ncountry in that transition period:--\r\n\r\nOn July 5 he landed at Carrickfergus, where he found that Lord\r\nChichester had a stately house, 'or rather like a prince's palace.'\r\nIn Belfast, he said, my Lord Chichester had another _daintie_, stately\r\npalace, which, indeed, was the glory and beauty of the town. And there\r\nwere also _daintie_ orchards, gardens, and walks planted. The Bishop\r\nof Dromore, to whom the town of Dromore entirely belonged, lived\r\nthere in a 'little timber house.' He was not given to hospitality, for\r\nthough his chaplain was a Manchester man, named Leigh, he allowed\r\nhis English visitor to stop at an inn over the way. 'This,' wrote the\r\ntourist, 'is a very dear house, 8 d. ordinary for ourselves, 6 d. for\r\nour servants, and we were overcharged in _beere_.' The way thence\r\nto Newry was most difficult for a stranger to find out. 'Therein he\r\nwandered, and, being lost, fell among the Irish _touns_.' The Irish\r\nhouses were the poorest cabins he had seen, erected in the middle of\r\nfields and grounds which they farmed and rented. 'This,' he added,\r\n'is a wild country, not inhabited, planted, nor enclosed.' He gave an\r\nIrishman 'a groat' to bring him into the way, yet he led him, like a\r\nvillein, directly out of the way, and so left him in the lurch.\r\n\r\nLeaving Belfast, this Englishman said: 'Near hereunto, Mr. Arthur\r\nHill, son and heir of Sir Moyses Hill, hath a brave plantation,\r\nwhich he holds by lease, and which has still forty years to come.\r\nThe plantation, it is said, doth yield him 1,000 l. per annum.\r\nMany Lancashire and Cheshire men are here planted. They sit upon a\r\nrack-rent, and pay 5 s. or 6 s. for good ploughing land, which now is\r\nclothed with excellent good _corne_.'\r\n\r\nAccording to the Down survey, made twenty-two years later, Dromore had\r\nnot improved: 'There are no buildings in this parish; only Dromore, it\r\nbeing a market town, hath some old thatched houses and a ruined church\r\nstanding in it. What other buildings are in the parish are nothing but\r\nremoveable _creaghts_.'\r\n\r\nTo the economist and the legislator, the most interesting portions\r\nof the state papers of the 16th and 17th centuries are, undoubtedly,\r\nthose which tell us how the people lived, how they were employed,\r\nhoused, and fed, what measure of happiness fell to their lot, and what\r\nwere the causes that affected their welfare, that made them contented\r\nand loyal, or miserable and disaffected. Contemporary authors, who\r\ndeal with social phenomena, are also read with special interest for\r\nthe same reason. They present pictures of society in their own time,\r\nand enable us to conceive the sort of life our forefathers led, and to\r\nestimate, at least in a rough way, what they did for posterity.\r\n\r\nHarris was moved to write his 'History of Down' by indignation at\r\nthe misrepresentations of the English press of his day. They had the\r\naudacity to say that 'the Irish people were uncivilised, rude, and\r\nbarbarous; that they delighted in butter _tempered_ with oatmeal,\r\nand sometimes flesh without bread, which they ate raw, having\r\nfirst pressed the blood out of it; and drank down large draughts of\r\nusquebaugh for digestion, reserving their little corn for the horses;\r\nthat their dress and habits were no less barbarous; that cattle\r\nwas their chief wealth; that they counted it no infamy to commit\r\nrobberies, and that in their view violence and murder were in no way\r\ndispleasing to God; that the country was overgrown with woods, which\r\nabounded in wolves and other voracious animals,' &c. It was, no doubt,\r\nvery provoking that such stories should be repeated 130 years\r\nafter the plantation of Ulster, and Harris undertook, with laudable\r\npatriotism, to show 'how far this description of Ireland was removed\r\nfrom the truth, from the present state of only one county in the\r\nkingdom.' The information which the well-informed writer gives is most\r\nvaluable, and very much to the purpose of our present inquiry.\r\n\r\nMore than half the arable ground was then (in 1745) under tillage,\r\naffording great quantities of oats, some rye and wheat, and 'plenty\r\nof barley,' commonly called English or spring barley, making excellent\r\nmalt liquor, which of late, by means of drying the grain with Kilkenny\r\ncoals, was exceedingly improved. The ale made in the county was\r\ndistinguished for its fine colour and flavour. The people found the\r\nbenefit of '_a sufficient tillage_, being not obliged to take up\r\nwith the poor unwholesome diet which the commonalty of Munster and\r\nConnaught had been forced to in the late years of scarcity; and\r\nsickness and mortality were not near so great as in other provinces of\r\nthe kingdom.'\r\n\r\nYet the county Down seemed very unfavourable for tillage. The\r\neconomists of our time, perhaps our viceroys too, would say it was\r\nonly fit for bullocks and sheep. It was 'naturally coarse, and full of\r\nhills; the air was sharp and cold in winter, with earlier frosts than\r\nin the south, the soil inclined to _wood_, unless constantly ploughed\r\nand kept open, and the low grounds degenerated into morass or bog\r\nwhere the drains were neglected. Yet, by the constant labour and\r\nindustry of the inhabitants, the morass grounds had of late, by\r\nburning and proper management, produced surprisingly large crops\r\nof rye and oats. Coarse lands, manured with lime, had answered the\r\nfarmers' views in wheat, and yielded a great produce, and wherever\r\nmarl was found there was great store of barley. The staple commodity\r\nof the county was linen, due care of which manufacture brought great\r\nwealth among the people. Consequently the county was observed to be\r\n'populous and flourishing, though it did not become amenable to the\r\nlaws till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, nor fully till the reign of\r\nJames I.' The English habit, language, and manners almost universally\r\nprevailed. 'Irish,' says Harris, 'can be heard only among the inferior\r\nrank of _Irish Papists_, and even that little diminishes every day, by\r\nthe great desire the poor natives have that their children should\r\nbe taught to read and write in the English tongue in the Charter, or\r\nother English Protestant schools, to which they willingly send them.'\r\nThe author exults in the progress of Protestantism. There were but two\r\nCatholic gentlemen in the county who had estates, and their income was\r\nvery moderate. When the priests were registered in 1704 there were but\r\nthirty in the county. In 1733 the books of the hearth-money collectors\r\nshowed--\r\n\r\nProtestant families in the county Down         14,000\r\nCatholic families                               5,210\r\nTotal Protestants, reckoning five a family     70,300\r\nTotal Catholics                                26,050\r\n                                               ______\r\nProtestant majority                            44,250\r\n\r\nOur author, who was an excellent Protestant of the 18th century type,\r\nwith boundless faith in the moral influence of the Charter schools,\r\nwould be greatly distressed if he could have lived in these degenerate\r\ndays, and seen the last religious census, which gives the following\r\nfigures for the county of Down:--\r\n\r\nProtestants of all denominations              202,026\r\nCatholics                                      97,240\r\n                                              _______\r\nTotal population                              299,266\r\n\r\nThe total number of souls in the county in the year 1733 was 96,350.\r\nThese figures show that the population was more than trebled in 130\r\nyears, and that the Catholics have increased nearly fourfold.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Hertfort estate illustrates every phase of the\r\ntenant-right question. It contains 66,000 acres, and comprises the\r\nbarony of Upper Massereene, part of the barony of Upper Belfast, in\r\nthe county of Antrim, and part of the baronies of Castlereagh and\r\nLower Iveagh, in the county of Down; consisting altogether of no\r\nless than 140 townlands. It extends from Dunmurry to Lough Neagh, a\r\ndistance of about fourteen miles as the crow flies. When the Devon\r\ncommission made its inquiry, the population upon this estate amounted\r\nto about 50,000. It contains mountain land, and the mountains are\r\nparticularly wet, because, unlike the mountains in other parts of the\r\ncountry, the substratum is a stiff retentive clay. At that time there\r\nwas not a spot of mountain or bog upon Lord Hertfort's estate that\r\nwas not let by the acre. About one-third of the land is of first-rate\r\nquality; there are 15,000 or 16,000 acres of mountain, and about the\r\nsame quantity of land of medium quality.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of Elizabeth's reign this property formed a section\r\nof the immense territory ruled over by the O'Neills. One of these\r\nprinces was called the Captain of _Kill-Ultagh_. In those times, when\r\nmight was right, this redoubtable chief levied heavy contributions\r\non the settlers, partly in retaliation for aggressions and outrages\r\nperpetrated by the English upon his own people. The queen, with the\r\nview of effecting a reconciliation, requested the lord deputy, Sir H.\r\nSidney, to pay the Irish chief a visit. He did so, but his welcome\r\nwas by no means gratifying. In fact, O'Neill would not condescend to\r\nreceive him at all. His reason for exhibiting a want of hospitality\r\nso un-Irish was this:--He said his 'home had been pillaged, his lands\r\nswept of their cattle, and his vassals shot like wild animals.' The\r\nlord deputy, in his notes of the northern tour, written in October,\r\n1585, says:--'I came to Kill-Ultagh, which I found rich and plentiful,\r\nafter the manner of these countries. But the captain was proud and\r\ninsolent; he would not come to me, nor have I apt reason to visit\r\nhim as I would. But he shall be paid for this before long; I will not\r\nremain in his debt.' The 'apt reason' for carrying out this threat\r\nsoon occurred. Tyrone had once more taken the field against the queen;\r\nthe captain joined his relative; all his property was consequently\r\nforfeited, and handed over to Sir Fulke Conway, a Welsh soldier of\r\nsome celebrity. Sir Fulke died in 1626, and his brother, who was a\r\nfavourite of Charles I., succeeded to the estate, to which his royal\r\npatron added the lands of Derryvolgie, thus making him lord of nearly\r\n70,000 statute acres of the broad lands of Down and Antrim. The\r\nConways brought over a number of English and Welsh families, who\r\nsettled on the estate, and intermarrying with the natives, a race of\r\nsturdy yeomen soon sprang up. The Conways were good landlords, and\r\ngreatly beloved by the people. With the addition made to the property\r\nthe king conferred upon the fortunate recipient of his bounty the\r\ntitle of Baron. At the close of 1627, Lord Conway began the erection\r\nof a castle (finished in 1630) on a picturesque mount overlooking\r\nthe Lagan, and commanding a view of the hills of Down. During the\r\nstruggles of 1641 the castle was burned down, together with\r\nthe greater part of the town, which up to this time was called\r\nLisnagarvah, but thenceforth it received the name of Lisburn. Very\r\nlittle, however, had been done by the settlers when the outbreak\r\noccurred, for an English traveller in 1635 remarked that 'neither the\r\ntown nor the country thereabouts was _planted_, being almost all woods\r\nand moorish.' About a month after the breaking out of the rebellion\r\nthe king's forces, under Sir George Rawdon, obtained a signal victory\r\nover the Irish commanded by Sir Phelim O'Neill, Sir Con M'Guinness,\r\nand General Plunket. In 1662 the town obtained a charter of\r\nincorporation from Charles II., and sent two members to the Irish\r\nparliament, the church being at the same time made the cathedral for\r\nDown and Connor. The Conway estates passed to the Seymours in this\r\nway. Popham Seymour, Esq., was the son of Sir Edward Seymour, fourth\r\nbaronet, described by Bishop Burnet as 'the ablest man of his party,\r\nthe first speaker of the House of Commons that was not bred to the\r\nlaw; a graceful man, bold and quick, and of high birth, being the\r\nelder branch of the Seymour family.' Popham Seymour inherited the\r\nestates of the Earl of Conway, who was his cousin, under a will dated\r\nAugust 19, 1683, and assumed in consequence the surname of Conway.\r\nThis gentleman died unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother\r\nFrancis, who was raised to the peerage in 1703 by the title of Baron\r\nConway, of Kill-Ultagh, county Antrim. His eldest son, the second\r\nbaron, was created Viscount Beauchamp and Earl of Hertfort in 1750. In\r\n1765 he was Viceroy of Ireland, and in 1793 he was created Marquis\r\nof Hertfort. The present peer, born in the year 1800, is the fourth\r\nmarquis, having succeeded his father in 1842.\r\n\r\nLisburn is classic ground. It represents all sorts of historic\r\ninterest. On this hill, now called the Castle Gardens, the Captain\r\nof Kill-Ultagh mustered his galloglasse. Here, amid the flames of the\r\nburning town, was fought a decisive battle between the English and the\r\nIrish, one of the Irish chiefs in that encounter being the ancestor of\r\nthe restorer of St. Patrick's Cathedral. The battle lasted till near\r\nmidnight, when the Irish were put to flight, leaving behind them dead\r\nand wounded thrice the number of the entire garrison. Here, on this\r\nmount, stood William III. in June, 1690. I saw in the church the\r\nmonument of Jeremy Taylor, and the pulpit from which the most eloquent\r\nof bishops delivered his immortal sermons. I saw the tablet erected\r\nby his mother to the memory of Nicholson, the young hero of Delhi,\r\nand those of several other natives of Lisburn who have contributed,\r\nby their genius and courage, to promote the fame and power of England.\r\nAmong the rest Lieutenant Dobbs, who was killed in an encounter with\r\nPaul Jones, the American pirate, in Carrickfergus Bay.\r\n\r\nI received a hospitable welcome from a loyal gentleman in the house\r\nwhich was the residence of General Munroe, the hero of '98, and saw\r\nthe spot in the square where he was hanged in view of his own windows.\r\nBut I confess that none of the monuments of the past excited so much\r\ninterest in my mind as the house of Louis Crommelin, the Huguenot\r\nrefugee, who founded the linen manufacture at Lisburn. That house is\r\nnow occupied by Mr. Hugh M'Call, author of 'Our Staple Manufactures,'\r\nwho worthily represents the intelligence, the public spirit, and\r\npatriotism of the English and French settlers, with a dash of the\r\nIrish ardour, a combination of elements which perhaps produces the\r\nbest 'staple' of character. I stood upon the identical oak floor upon\r\nwhich old Crommelin planned and worked, and in the grave-yard\r\nMr. M'Call deciphered for me the almost obliterated inscriptions,\r\nrecording the deaths of various members of the Crommelin family. Their\r\nleader, Louis himself, died in July, 1727, aged 75 years.\r\n\r\nThe revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove three quarters of a\r\nmillion of Protestants out of France. A great number settled\r\nin London, where they established the arts of silk-weaving in\r\nSpitalfields and of fancy jewellery in St. Giles's. About 6,000 fled\r\nto Ireland, of whom many settled in Dublin, where they commenced the\r\nsilk manufacture, and where one of them, La Touche, opened the first\r\nbanking establishment. Wherever they settled they were missionaries of\r\nindustry, and examples of perseverance and success in skilled labour,\r\nas well as integrity in commerce. Many of those exiles settled in\r\nLisburn, and the colony was subsequently joined by Louis Crommelin,\r\na native of Armandcourt near St. Quentin, where for several centuries\r\nhis forefathers had carried on the flaxen manufacture on their own\r\nextensive possessions in the province of Picardy. Foreseeing the\r\nstorm of persecution, the family had removed to Holland, and, at the\r\npersonal request of the Prince of Orange, Louis came over to take\r\ncharge of the colonies of his countrymen, which had been established\r\nin different parts of Ireland. The linen trade had flourished in this\r\ncountry from the earliest times. Linen formed, down to the reign of\r\nElizabeth, almost the only dress of the population, from the\r\nking down--saffron-coloured, and worn in immense flowing robes,\r\noccasionally wrapped in various forms round the body. Lord Stafford\r\nhad exerted himself strenuously to improve the fabric by the forcible\r\nintroduction of better looms; but little had been done in this\r\ndirection till the Huguenots came and brought their own looms, suited\r\nfor the manufacture of fine fabrics. Mark Dupre, Nicholas de la\r\nCherois, Obre, Rochet, Bouchoir, St. Clair, and others, whose ashes\r\nlie beside the Lisburn Cathedral and in the neighbouring churchyards,\r\nand many of whose descendants still survive among the gentry and\r\nmanufacturers of Down and Antrim, were, with Crommelin, the chief\r\npromoters of the linen trade which has wrought such wonders in the\r\nprovince of Ulster. Lord Conway granted the Lisburn colonists a site\r\nfor a place of worship, which was known as the French Church, and\r\nstood on the ground now occupied by the Court-house in Castle Street.\r\nThe Government paid 60 l. a year to their first minister, Charles de\r\nla Valade, who was succeeded by his relative, the Rev. Saumarez du\r\nBourdieu, distinguished as a divine and a historian. His father was\r\nchaplain to the famous Schomberg, and when he fell from his horse\r\nmortally wounded the reverend gentleman carried him in his arms to\r\nthe spot on which he died a short time after. Talent was hereditary in\r\nthis family, the Rev. John du Bourdieu, rector of Annahilt, was author\r\nof the Statistical Surveys of Down and Antrim, published by the Royal\r\nDublin Society. Referring to his ancestors he says that his father\r\nhad been fifty-six years minister of the French Church in Lisburn. Mr.\r\nM'Call states that, for some time before his death in 1812, he held\r\nthe living of Lambeg, the members of the French Church having by that\r\ntime merged into union with the congregation of the Lisburn Cathedral.\r\nA similar process took place in Dublin, Portarlington, and elsewhere,\r\nthe descendants of the Huguenots becoming zealous members of the\r\nEstablished Church.\r\n\r\nDu Bourdieu informs us that Louis Crommelin obtained a patent for\r\ncarrying on and improving the linen manufacture, with a grant of 800\r\nl. per annum, as interest of 10,000 l., to be advanced by him as a\r\ncapital for carrying on the same; 200 l. per annum for his trouble;\r\n120 l. per annum for three assistants; and 160 l. for the support of\r\nthe chaplain. Mr. M'Call, in his book, copies the following note of\r\npayments made by the Government from 1704 to 1708:--\r\n\r\n                                                       £   s.   d.\r\n\r\nLouis Crommelin, as overseer of linen manufacture    470   19    0\r\n\r\nW.

Du Bourdieu mentions that Lisburn and\r\nLurgan were the great markets for cambrics--the name given to cloth\r\nof this description, which was then above five shillings a yard; under\r\nthat price it was called lawn. In that neighbourhood cambric had been\r\nmade which sold for 1 l. 2 s. 9 d. a yard unbleached. The principal\r\nmanufacturing establishments in addition to Messrs. Coulsons' are\r\nthose of the Messrs. Richardson and Co. and the Messrs. Barbour.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin has written the ablest defence of the Irish landlords\r\nthat has ever appeared. In that masterly work he says: 'But though\r\na dealer in land and a payer of wages, I am above all things an\r\nIrishman, and as an Irishman I rejoice in any circumstance which tends\r\nto strengthen the independence of the tenant farmer, or to add to\r\nthe comfort of the labourer's existence.' If titles and possessions\r\nimplied the inheritance of religion and blood, Lord Dufferin ought\r\nindeed to be 'Irish of the Irish' as the men of Ulster in the olden\r\ntimes proudly called themselves. On the railroad from Belfast to\r\nBangor there is a station constructed with singular beauty, like\r\nthe castellated entrance to a baronial hall, and on the elaborately\r\nchiselled stone we read 'Clandeboye.' Under the railway from Graypoint\r\non Belfast Lough runs a carriage-drive two miles long, to the famous\r\nseat of the O'Neills, where his lordship's mansion is situated,\r\nenclosed among aged trees, remembrancers of the past. Perhaps, there\r\nis no combination of names in the kingdom more suggestive of the\r\nbarbaric power of the middle ages and the most refined culture of\r\nmodern civilisation. The avenue, kept like a garden walk, with a\r\nflourishing plantation on each side, was cut through some of the\r\nbest farms on the estate, and must have been a work of great expense.\r\nTaking this in connection with other costly improvements, among which\r\nare several picturesque buildings for the residence of workmen--model\r\nlodging-houses resembling fancy villas at the seaside--we can\r\nunderstand how his lordship, within the last fifteen years, has paid\r\naway in wages of labour the immense sum of 60,000 l., at the rate of\r\n4,000 l. a year.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot of Bangor never gave employment like that. William O'Donnon,\r\nthe last of the line, was found in the thirty-second year of Henry\r\nVIII. to be possessed of thirty-one townlands in Ards and Upper\r\nClandeboye, the grange of Earbeg in the county Antrim, the two\r\nCopeland Islands, the tithes of the island of Raghery, three rectories\r\nin Antrim, three in Down, and a townland in the Isle of Man. The\r\nabbey, some of the walls of which still remain, adjoining the parish\r\nchurch, was built early in the twelfth century. We are informed by\r\nArchdall, that it had so gone to ruin in 1469 through the neglect\r\nof the abbot, that he was evicted by order of Pope Paul II., who\r\ncommanded that the friars of the third order of St. Francis should\r\nimmediately take possession of it, which was accordingly done,\r\nsays Wadding, by Father Nicholas of that order. The whole of the\r\npossessions were granted by James I. to James Viscount Clandeboye.\r\n\r\nBangor was one of the most celebrated schools in Ireland when this\r\nisland was said to have been 'the _quiet_ abode of learning and\r\nsanctity.' As to the quiet, I could never make out at what period it\r\nexisted, nor how the 'thousands' of students at Bangor could have been\r\nsupported. The Danes came occasionally up the lough and murdered the\r\nmonks _en masse_, plundering the shrines. But the greatest scourges of\r\nthe monasteries in Down and elsewhere were, not the foreign pagans and\r\npirates, but the professedly Christian chiefs of their own country. It\r\nappears, therefore, that neither the Irish clergy nor the people have\r\nmuch reason to regret the flight of the Celtic princes and nobles, who\r\nwere utterly unable to fulfil the duties of a government; and who did\r\nlittle or nothing but consume what the industry of the peasants, under\r\nunparalleled difficulties, produced. The people of Clandeboye and\r\nDufferin might have been proud that their chief received 40 l. a year\r\nas a tribute or blackmail from Lecale, that he might abstain from\r\nvisiting the settlers there with his galloglasse; but Lord Dufferin,\r\nthe successor of the O'Neill of Clandeboye, spends among the peasantry\r\nof the present day 4,000 l. a year in wages. And how different is the\r\nlot of the people! Not dwelling in wattled huts under the oaks of the\r\nprimeval forest, but in neat slated houses, with whitewashed walls,\r\nlooking so bright and pretty in the sunshine, like snowdrops in the\r\ndistant landscape. On the hill between Bangor and Newtownards, Lord\r\nDufferin has erected a beautiful tower, from which, reclining on his\r\ncouch, he can see the country to an immense extent, from the mountains\r\nof Antrim to the mountains of Mourne, Strangford Lough, Belfast Lough,\r\nthe Antrim coast, and Portpatrick at the other side of the Channel,\r\nall spread out before him like a coloured map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE REBELLION OF 1641.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rebellion of 1641--generally called a 'massacre'--was undoubtedly\r\na struggle on the part of the exiled nobles and clergy and the evicted\r\npeasants to get possession of their estates and farms, which had been\r\noccupied by the British settlers for nearly a generation. They\r\nmight probably have continued to occupy them in peace, but for the\r\nfanaticism of the lords justices, Sir John Parsons and Sir John\r\nBorlace. It was reported and believed that, at a public entertainment\r\nin Dublin, Parsons declared that in twelve months no more Catholics\r\nshould be seen in that country. The English Puritans and Scottish\r\nCovenanters were determined never to lay down their arms till they had\r\nmade an end of Popery. Pym, the celebrated Puritan leader, avowed that\r\nthe policy of his party was not to leave a priest alive in the land.\r\nMeantime, the Irish chiefs were busy intriguing at Rome, Madrid,\r\nParis, and other continental capitals, clamouring for an invasion of\r\nIreland, to restore monarchy and Catholicity--to expel the English\r\nplanters from the forfeited lands. Philip III. of Spain encouraged\r\nthese aspirations. He had an Irish legion under the command of Henry\r\nO'Neill, son of the fugitive Earl of Tyrone. It was reported that,\r\nin 1630 there were in the service of the Archduchess, in the Spanish\r\nNetherlands alone, 100 Irish officers able to command companies, and\r\n20 fit to be colonels. There were many others at Lisbon, Florence,\r\nMilan, and Naples. They had in readiness 5,000 or 6,000 stand of arms\r\nlaid up at Antwerp, bought out of the deduction of their monthly pay.\r\nThe banished ecclesiastics formed at every court a most efficient\r\ndiplomatic corps, the chief of these intriguers being the celebrated\r\nLuke Wadding. Religious wars were popular in those times, and the\r\ninvasion of Ireland would be like a crusade against heresy. But with\r\nthe Irish chiefs the ruling passion was to get possession of their\r\nhomes and their lands. The most active spirit among these was Roger,\r\nor Rory O'Moore, a man of high character, great ability, handsome\r\nperson, and fascinating manners. With him were associated Conor\r\nMaguire, Costelloe M'Mahon, and Thorlough O'Neill, Sir Phelim O'Neill,\r\nSir Con Magennis, Colonel Hugh M'Mahon, and the Rev. Dr. Heber\r\nM'Mahon. O'Moore visited the country, went through the several\r\nprovinces, and, by communicating with the chiefs personally, organised\r\nthe conspiracy to expel the British and recover the kingdom for\r\nCharles II. and the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe plan agreed upon by the confederates was this:--A rising when\r\nthe harvest was gathered in; a simultaneous attack on all the English\r\nfortresses; the surprise of Dublin Castle, said to contain arms for\r\n12,000 men; and to obtain for these objects all possible aid, in\r\nofficers, men, and arms, from the Continent. The rising took place\r\non the night of October 22, 1641. It might have been completely\r\nsuccessful if the Castle of Dublin had been seized. It seemed an\r\neasy prey, for it was guarded only by a few pensioners and forty\r\nhalberdiers, who would be quickly overpowered. But the plot was\r\nmade known to the lords justices by an informer when on the eve of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nSir Phelim O'Neill was one of those 'Irish gentlemen' who, by royal\r\nfavour, were permitted to retain some portions of their ancient\r\npatrimonies. At this time he was in possession of thirty-eight\r\ntownlands in the barony of Dungannon, county Tyrone, containing 23,000\r\nacres, then estimated to be worth 1,600 l. a-year, equal to some\r\n10,000 l. of our money. Charles Boulton held by lease from the\r\nsame chief 600 acres, at a yearly rent of 29 l. for sixty years, in\r\nconsideration of a fine of 1,000 l. In 1641 this property yielded a\r\nprofit rent of 150 l. a year. Three townlands in the same barony were\r\nclaimed by George Rawden of Lisnagarvagh, as leased to him by Sir\r\nPhelim under the rent of 100 l., estimated to be worth 50 l. per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nSir Phelim might, therefore, have been content, so far as property was\r\nconcerned. But, setting aside patriotism, religion, and ambition, it\r\nis likely enough that he distrusted the Government, and feared the\r\ndoom pronounced in Dublin Castle against all the gentlemen of his\r\ncreed and race. At all events he put himself at the head of the\r\ninsurrection in Ulster. He and the officers under his command, on the\r\nnight of the 22nd, surprised and captured the forts of Charlemont and\r\nMountjoy. The towns of Dungannon, Newry, Carrickmacross, Castleblaney,\r\nTandragee fell into the hands of the insurgents, while the O'Reillys\r\nand Maguires overran Cavan and Fermanagh. Sir Conor Magennis wrote\r\nfrom Newry to the Government officers in Down: 'We are for our lives\r\nand liberties. We desire no blood to be shed; but, if you mean to shed\r\nour blood, be sure we shall be as ready as you for that purpose.' And\r\nSir Phelim O'Neill issued the following proclamation:--\r\n\r\n'These are to intimate and make known unto all persons whatsoever, in\r\nand through the whole country, the true intent and meaning of us whose\r\nnames are hereunto subscribed: 1. That the first assembling of us is\r\nnowise intended against our sovereign lord the king, nor hurt of any\r\nof his subjects, either English or Scotch; but only for the defence\r\nand libertie of ourselves and the Irish natives of this kingdom. And\r\nwe further declare that whatsoever hurt hitherto hath been done to\r\nany person shall be presently repaired; and we will that every person\r\nforthwith, after proclamation hereof, make their speedy repaire unto\r\ntheir own houses, under paine of death, that no further hurt be done\r\nunto any one under the like paine, and that this be proclaimed in all\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n  'PHELIM O'NEILL.\r\n\r\n  'At Dungannon, the 23rd October, 1641.'\r\n\r\nIt is easy for an insurgent chief to give such orders to a tumultuous\r\nmass of excited, vindictive, and drunken men, but not so easy to\r\nenforce them. The common notion among Protestants, however, that a\r\nmidnight massacre of all the Protestant settlers was intended, or\r\nattempted, is certainly unfounded. Though horrible outrages were\r\ncommitted on both sides, the number of them has been greatly\r\nexaggerated. Mr. Prendergast quotes some contemporary authorities,\r\nwhich seem to be decisive on this point. In the same year was\r\npublished by 'G.S., minister of God's word in Ireland,' 'A Brief\r\nDeclaration of the Barbarous and Inhuman Dealings of the Northern\r\nIrish Rebels ...; written to excite the English Nation to relieve\r\nour poor Wives and Children that have escaped the Rebels' savage\r\nCruelties.'\r\n\r\nThis author says, it was the intention of the Irish to massacre all\r\nthe English. On Saturday they were to disarm them; on Sunday to seize\r\nall their cattle and goods; on Monday, at the watchword 'Skeane,' they\r\nwere to cut all the English throats. The former they executed; the\r\nthird only (that is the massacre) they failed in.\r\n\r\nThat the massacre rested hitherto in intention only is further evident\r\nfrom the proclamation of the lords justices of February 8, 1642;\r\nfor, while offering large sums for the heads of the chief northern\r\ngentlemen in arms (Sir Phelim O'Neill's name heading the list with\r\na thousand pounds), the lords justices state that the massacre had\r\nfailed. Many thousands had been robbed and spoiled, dispossessed of\r\nhouse and lands, many murdered on the spot; but the chief part of\r\ntheir plots (so the proclamation states), and amongst them a universal\r\nmassacre, had been disappointed.\r\n\r\nBut, says Mr. Prendergast, after Lord Ormond and Sir Simon Harcourt,\r\nwith the English forces, in the month of April, 1642, had burned the\r\nhouses of the gentry in the Pale, and committed slaughters of unarmed\r\nmen, and the Scotch forces, in the same month, after beating off\r\nSir Phelim O'Neill's army at Newry, drowned and shot men, women, and\r\npriests, in that town, who had surrendered on condition of mercy, then\r\nit was that some of Sir Phelim O'Neill's wild followers in revenge,\r\nand in fear of the advancing army, massacred their prisoners in some\r\nof the towns in Tyrone. The subsequent cruelties were not on one side\r\nonly, and were magnified to render the Irish detestable, so as to make\r\nit impossible for the king to seek their aid without ruining his cause\r\nutterly in England. The story of the massacre, invented to serve\r\nthe politics of the hour, has been since kept up for the purposes\r\nof interest. No inventions could be too monstrous that served to\r\nstrengthen the possession of Irish confiscated lands.\r\n\r\n'A True Relation of the Proceedings of the Scots and English Forces in\r\nthe North of Ireland,' published in 1642, states that on Monday, May\r\n5, the common soldiers, without direction from the general-major, took\r\nsome eighteen of the Irish women of the town [Newry], stripped them\r\nnaked, threw them into the river, and drowned them, shooting some in\r\nthe water. More had suffered so, but that some of the common soldiers\r\nwere made examples of.\r\n\r\n'A Levite's Lamentation,' published at the same time, thus refers\r\nto those atrocities: 'Mr. Griffin, Mr. Bartly, Mr. Starkey, all of\r\nArdmagh, and murdered by these bloudsuckers on the sixth of May. For,\r\nabout the fourth of May, as I take it, we put neare fourty of them\r\nto death upon the bridge of the Newry, amongst which were two of\r\nthe Pope's pedlers, two seminary priests, in return of which they\r\nslaughtered many prisoners in their custody.'\r\n\r\nA curious illustration of the spirit of that age is given in the fact\r\nthat an English officer threw up his commission in disgust, because\r\nthe Bishop of Meath, in a sermon delivered in Christ Church, Dublin,\r\nin 1642, pleaded for mercy to Irish women and children.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate settlers fled panic-stricken from their homes, leaving\r\nbehind their goods, and, in many cases, their clothes; delicate women\r\nwith little children, weary and footsore, hurried on to some place\r\nof refuge. In Cavan they crowded the house of the illustrious\r\nBishop Bedell, at Kilmore. Enniskillen, Derry, Lisburn, Belfast,\r\nCarrickfergus, with some isolated castles, were still held by the\r\nEnglish garrisons, and in these the Protestant fugitives found succour\r\nand protection. Before their flight they were in such terror that,\r\naccording to the Rev. Dr. Maxwell, rector of Tynan, for three nights\r\nno cock was heard to crow, no dog to bark. The city of London sent\r\nfour ships to Londonderry with all kinds of provisions, clothing,\r\nand accoutrements for several companies of foot, and abundance\r\nof ammunition. The twelve chief companies sent each two pieces of\r\nordnance. No doubt these liberal and seasonable supplies contributed\r\nmaterially to keep the city from yielding to the insurgent forces by\r\nwhich it was besieged.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Government in Dublin lost not a moment in taking the\r\nmost effectual measures for crushing the rebellion. Lord Ormond, as\r\nlieutenant-general, had soon at his disposal 12,000 men, with a fine\r\ntrain of field artillery, provided by Strafford for his campaign in\r\nthe north of England. The king, who was in Scotland, procured the\r\ndispatch of 1,500 men to Ulster; and authorised Lords Chichester and\r\nClandeboye to raise regiments among their tenants. Thus the 'Scottish\r\narmy' was increased to about 5,000 foot, with cavalry in proportion.\r\nThe Irish, on the other hand, were ill-provided with arms and\r\nammunition. They were not even provided with pikes, for they had not\r\ntime to make them. The military officers counted upon did not appear,\r\nthough they had promised to be on the field at fourteen days' notice.\r\nRory O'Moore, like 'Meagher of the sword' in 1848, had never seen\r\nservice; and Sir Phelim O'Neill, like Smith O'Brien, was only a\r\ncivilian when he assumed the high-sounding title of 'Lord General of\r\nthe Catholic army in Ulster.' He also took the title of 'the O'Neill.'\r\nThe massacre of a large number of Catholics by the Carrickfergus\r\ngarrison, driving them over the cliffs into the sea at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, madly excited the Irish thirst for blood. Mr. Darcy\r\nMagee admits that, from this date forward till the arrival of Owen Roe\r\nO'Neill, the war assumed a ferocity of character foreign to the nature\r\nof O'Moore, O'Reilly, and Magennis. 'That Sir Phelim permitted, if\r\nhe did not in his gusts of stormy passion instigate, those acts of\r\ncruelty which have stained his otherwise honourable conduct, is too\r\ntrue; but he stood alone among his confederates in that crime, and\r\nthat crime stands alone in his character. Brave to rashness and\r\ndisinterested to excess, few rebel chiefs ever made a more heroic end\r\nout of a more deplorable beginning.' The same eulogy would equally\r\napply to many of the English generals. Cruelty was their only crime.\r\nThe Irish rulers of those times, if not taken by surprise, felt at the\r\noutbreak of open rebellion much as the army feels at the breaking\r\nout of a war, in some country where plenty of prize money can be won,\r\nwhere the looting will be rich and the promotion rapid. Relying with\r\nconfidence on the power of England and the force of discipline, they\r\nknew that the active defenders of the Government would be victorious\r\nin the end, and that their rewards would be estates. The more\r\nrebellions, the more forfeited territory, the more opportunities to\r\nimplicate, ruin, and despoil the principal men of the hated race. The\r\nmost sober writer, dealing with such facts, cannot help stirring men's\r\nblood while recording the deeds of the heroes who founded the English\r\nsystem of government in Ireland, and secured to themselves immense\r\ntracts of its most fertile soil. What then must be the effect of the\r\neloquent and impassioned denunciations of such writers as Mr.\r\nButt, Mr. A.M. Sullivan, and Mr. John Mitchell, not to speak of the\r\n'national press'? Yet the most fiery patriot utters nothing stronger\r\non the English rule in Ireland than what the Irish may read in the\r\nworks of the greatest statesmen and most profound thinkers in England.\r\nThe evil is in the facts, and the facts cannot be suppressed because\r\nthey are the roots of our present difficulties. Mr. Darcy Magee, one\r\nof the most moderate of Irish historians, writing far away from his\r\nnative land, not long before he fell by the bullet of the assassin--a\r\nmartyr to his loyalty--sketches the preliminaries of confiscation at\r\nthe commencement of this civil war.\r\n\r\nIn Munster, their chief instruments were the aged Earl of Cork, still\r\ninsatiable as ever for other men's possessions, and the president,\r\nSt. Leger: in Leinster, Sir Charles Coote. Lord Cork prepared 1,100\r\nindictments against men of property in his province, which he sent to\r\nthe speaker of the Long Parliament, with an urgent request that\r\nthey might be returned to him, with authority to proceed against the\r\nparties named as outlaws. In Leinster, 4,000 similar indictments\r\nwere found in the course of two days by the free use of the rack with\r\nwitnesses. Sir John Read, an officer of the king's bedchamber, and\r\nMr. Barnwall of Kilbrue, a gentleman of threescore and six, were among\r\nthose who underwent the torture. When these were the proceedings of\r\nthe tribunals in peaceable cities, we may imagine what must have been\r\nthe excesses of the soldiery in the open country. In the south,\r\nSir William St. Leger directed a series of murderous raids upon the\r\npeasantry of Cork, which at length produced their natural effect. Lord\r\nMuskerry and other leading recusants, who had offered their services\r\nto maintain the peace of the province, were driven by an insulting\r\nrefusal to combine for their own protection. The 1,100 indictments\r\nof Lord Cork soon swelled their ranks, and the capture of the ancient\r\ncity of Cashel, by Philip O'Dwyer, announced the insurrection of the\r\nsouth. Waterford soon after opened its gates to Colonel Edmund Butler;\r\nWexford declared for the Catholic cause, and Kilkenny surrendered to\r\nLord Mountgarret. In Wicklow, Coote's troopers committed murders such\r\nas had not been equalled since the days of the pagan Northmen. Little\r\nchildren were carried aloft writhing on the pikes of these barbarians,\r\nwhose worthy commander confessed that 'he liked such frolics.' Neither\r\nage nor sex was spared, and an ecclesiastic was especially certain\r\nof instant death. Fathers Higgins and White of Naas, in Kildare, were\r\ngiven up by Coote to these 'lambs,' though, each had been granted a\r\nsafe-conduct by his superior officer, Lord Ormond. And these murders\r\nwere taking place at the very time when the Franciscans and Jesuits of\r\nCashel were protecting Dr. Pullen, the Protestant chancellor of that\r\ncathedral and other Protestant prisoners; while also the castle of\r\nCloughouter, in Cavan, the residence of Bishop Bedell, was crowded\r\nwith Protestant fugitives, all of whom were carefully guarded by the\r\nchivalrous Philip O'Reilly.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster, by the end of April, there were 19,000 troops, regulars and\r\nvolunteers, in the garrison or in the field. Newry was taken by Monroe\r\nand Chichester. Magennis was obliged to abandon Down, and McMahon\r\nMonaghan; Sir Phelim was driven to burn Armagh and Dungannon and to\r\ntake his last stand at Charlemont. In a severe action with Sir Robert\r\nand Sir William Stewart, he had displayed his usual courage with\r\nbetter than his usual fortune, which, perhaps, we may attribute to the\r\npresence with him of Sir Alexander McDonnell, brother to Lord Antrim,\r\nthe famous _Colkitto_ of the Irish and Scottish wars. But the severest\r\ndefeat which the confederates had was in the heart of Leinster, at the\r\nhamlet of Kilrush, within four miles of Athy. Lord Ormond, returning\r\nfrom a second reinforcement of Naas and other Kildare forts, at\r\nthe head, by English account, of 4,000 men, found on April 13 the\r\nCatholics of the midland counties, under Lords Mountgarrett, Ikerrin,\r\nand Dunboyne, Sir Morgan Cavenagh, Rory O'Moore, and Hugh O'Byrne,\r\ndrawn up, by his report 8,000 strong, to dispute his passage. With\r\nOrmond were the Lord Dillon, Lord Brabazon, Sir Richard Grenville, Sir\r\nCharles Coote, and Sir T. Lucas. The combat was short but murderous.\r\nThe confederates left 700 men, including Sir Morgan Cavenagh and\r\nsome other officers, dead on the field; the remainder retreated in\r\ndisorder, and Ormond, with an inconsiderable diminution of numbers,\r\nreturned in triumph to Dublin. For this victory the Long Parliament,\r\nin a moment of enthusiasm, voted the lieutenant-general a jewel worth\r\n500 l. If any satisfaction could be derived from such an incident, the\r\nviolent death of their most ruthless enemy, Sir Charles Coote, might\r\nhave afforded the Catholics some consolation. That merciless soldier,\r\nafter the combat at Kilrush, had been employed in reinforcing Birr and\r\nrelieving the castle of Geashill, which the Lady Letitia of Offally\r\nheld against the neighbouring tribe of O'Dempsey. On his return from\r\nthis service he made a foray against a Catholic force, which had\r\nmustered in the neighbourhood of Trim; here, on the night of the 7th\r\nof May, heading a sally of his troop, he fell by a musket shot--not\r\nwithout suspicion of being fired from his own ranks. His son and\r\nnamesake, who imitated him in all things, was ennobled at the\r\nRestoration by the title of the Earl of Mountrath.\r\n\r\nThe Long Parliament would not trust the king with an army in Ireland.\r\nThey consequently took the work of subjugation into their own hands.\r\nHaving confiscated 2,500,000 acres of Irish land, they offered it as\r\nsecurity to 'adventurers' who would advance money to meet the cost of\r\nthe war. In February, 1642, the House of Commons received a petition\r\n'of divers well affected' to it, offering to raise and maintain forces\r\nat their own charge 'against the rebels of Ireland, and afterwards to\r\nreceive their recompense out of the rebels' estates.' Under the act\r\n'for the speedy reducing of the rebels' the adventurers were to carry\r\nover a brigade of 5,000 foot and 500 horse, and to have the right of\r\nappointing their own officers. And they were to have estates given to\r\nthem at the following rates: 1,000 acres for 200 l. in Ulster, for 300\r\nl. in Connaught, for 450 l. in Munster, and 600 l. in Leinster. The\r\nrates per acre were 4 s., 6s., 8s., and 12 s. in those provinces\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the war, and the spirit in which it was conducted, may\r\nbe inferred from the sort of weapons issued from the military\r\nstores. These included scythes with handles and rings, reaping-hooks,\r\nwhetstones, and rubstones. They were intended for cutting down the\r\ngrowing corn, that the people might be starved into submission, or\r\nforced to quit the country. The commissary of stores was ordered to\r\nissue Bibles to the troops, one Bible for every file, that they might\r\nlearn from the Old Testament the sin and danger of sparing idolaters.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion in Ulster had almost collapsed before the end of the\r\nyear. The tens of thousands who had rushed to the standard of Sir\r\nP. O'Neill were now reduced to a number of weak and disorganised\r\ncollections of armed men taking shelter in the woods. The English\r\ngarrisons scoured the neighbouring counties with little opposition,\r\nand where they met any they gave no quarter. Sir William Cole,\r\nancestor of the Earl of Enniskillen, proudly boasted of his\r\nachievement in having 7,000 of the rebels famished to death within\r\na circuit of a few miles of his garrison. Lord Enniskillen is an\r\nexcellent landlord, but the descendants of the remnant of the natives\r\non his estate do not forget how the family obtained its wealth and\r\nhonours. The Government, however, seemed to have good reason to\r\ncongratulate itself that the war was over with the Irish. To these Sir\r\nPhelim O'Neill had shown that there is something in a name: but if\r\nthe name does not represent real worth and fitness for the work\r\nundertaken, it is but a shadow. It was so in Sir Phelim's O'Neill's\r\ncase. Though he had courage, he was a poor general. But another hero\r\nof the same name soon appeared to redeem the honour of his race, and\r\nto show what the right man can do. At a moment when the national\r\ncause seemed to be lost, when the Celtic population in Ulster were\r\nmeditating a wholesale emigration to the Scottish Highlands--'a word\r\nof magic effect was whispered from the sea-coast to the interior.'\r\nColonel Owen Roe O'Neill had arrived off Donegal with a single ship,\r\na single company of veterans, 100 officers, and a quantity of\r\nammunition. He landed at Doe Castle, proceeded to the fort of\r\nCharlemont, met the heads of the clans at Clones in Monaghan, was\r\nelected general-in-chief of the Catholic forces, and at once set about\r\norganising an army. The Catholics of the whole kingdom had joined a\r\nconfederation, which held its meetings at Kilkenny. A general assembly\r\nwas convened for October 23, 1642. The peerage was represented by\r\nfourteen lords and eleven bishops. Generals were appointed for each\r\nof the other provinces, Preston for Leinster, Barry for Munster, and\r\nBurke for Connaught. With the Anglo-Irish portion of the confederacy\r\nthe war was Catholic, and the object religious liberty. With them\r\nthere was no antipathy or animosity to the English. There was the\r\nPope's Nuncio and his party, thinking most of papal interests, and\r\nthere was the national party, who had been, or were likely to be,\r\nmade landless. The king, then at Oxford, was importuned by the\r\nconfederation on the one side and the Puritans on the other; one\r\npetitioning for freedom of worship, the other for the suppression of\r\npopery. Pending these appeals there was a long cessation between the\r\nIrish belligerents.\r\n\r\nOrmond had amused the confederates with negotiations for a permanent\r\npeace and settlement, from spring till midsummer, when Charles,\r\ndissatisfied with these endless delays, dispatched to Ireland a more\r\nhopeful ambassador. This was Herbert, Earl of Glamorgan, one of the\r\nfew Catholics remaining among the English nobility, son and heir to\r\nthe Marquis of Worcester, and son-in-law to Henry O'Brien, Earl of\r\nThomond. Of a family devoutly attached to the royal cause, to which\r\nit is said they had contributed not less than 200,000 l., Glamorgan's\r\nreligion, his rank, his Irish connections, the intimate confidence of\r\nthe king which he was known to possess, all marked out his embassy as\r\none of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nThe earl arrived in Dublin about August 1, and, after an interview\r\nwith Ormond, proceeded to Kilkenny. On the 28th of that month,\r\npreliminary articles were agreed to and signed by the earl on behalf\r\nof the king, and by Lords Montgarrett and Muskerry on behalf of the\r\nconfederates. It was necessary, it seems, to get the concurrence of\r\nthe Viceroy to these terms, and accordingly the negotiators on both\r\nsides repaired to Dublin. Here Ormond contrived to detain them ten\r\nlong weeks in discussions on the articles relating to religion; it\r\nwas the 12th of November when they returned to Kilkenny, with a much\r\nmodified treaty. On the next day, the 13th, the new Papal Nuncio,\r\na prelate who, by his rank, his eloquence, and his imprudence, was\r\ndestined to exercise a powerful influence on the Catholic councils,\r\nmade his public entry into that city.\r\n\r\nThis personage was John Baptist Rinuccini, Archbishop of Fermo in\r\nthe marches of Ancona, which see he had preferred to the more exalted\r\ndignity of Florence.\r\n\r\nFrom Limerick, borne along on his litter, such was the feebleness\r\nof his health, he advanced by slow stages to Kilkenny, escorted by a\r\nguard of honour, despatched on that duty by the supreme council.\r\n\r\nThe pomp and splendour of his public entry into the Catholic capital\r\nwas a striking spectacle. The previous night he slept at a village\r\nthree miles from the city, for which he set out early on the morning\r\nof November 13, escorted by his guard and a vast multitude of the\r\npeople. Five delegates from the supreme council accompanied him. A\r\nband of fifty students, mounted on horseback, met him on the way, and\r\ntheir leader, crowned with laurel, recited some congratulatory Latin\r\nverses. At the city gate he left the litter and mounted a horse richly\r\nhoused; here the procession of the clergy and the city guilds awaited\r\nhim: at the market cross, a Latin oration was delivered in his honour,\r\nto which he graciously replied in the same language. From the cross he\r\nwas escorted to the cathedral, at the door of which he was received by\r\nthe aged bishop, Dr. David Rothe. At the high altar he intonated the\r\n_Te Deum_, and gave the multitude the apostolic benediction. Then he\r\nwas conducted to his lodgings, where he was soon waited upon by Lord\r\nMuskerry and General Preston, who brought him to Kilkenny Castle,\r\nwhere, in the great gallery, which elicited even a Florentine's\r\nadmiration, he was received in stately formality by the president of\r\nthe council--Lord Mountgarrett. Another Latin oration on the nature of\r\nhis embassy was delivered by the Nuncio, responded to by Heber, Bishop\r\nof Clogher, and so the ceremony of reception ended.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Darcy Magee, vol. ii. p.128.]\r\n\r\nAfter a long time spent in negotiations, the celebrated Glamorgan\r\ntreaty was signed by Ormond for the king, and Lord Muskerry and the\r\nother commissioners for the confederates. It conceded, in fact, all\r\nthe most essential claims of the Irish--equal rights as to property,\r\nin the army, in the universities, and at the bar; gave them seats in\r\nboth houses and on the bench; authorised a special commission of oyer\r\nand terminer, composed wholly of confederates; and declared that 'the\r\nindependency of the parliament of Ireland on that of England' should\r\nbe decided by declaration of both houses 'agreeably to the laws of the\r\nkingdom of Ireland.' In short, this final form of Glamorgan's treaty\r\ngave the Irish Catholics, in 1646, all that was subsequently obtained,\r\neither for the church or the country, in 1782, 1793, or 1829. 'Though\r\nsome conditions were omitted, to which Rinuccini and a majority of the\r\nprelates attached importance, Glamorgan's treaty was, upon the whole,\r\na charter upon which a free church and a free people might well have\r\nstood, as the fundamental law of their religious and civil liberties.'\r\n\r\nGeneral O'Neill was greatly annoyed at these delays. Political\r\nevents in England swayed the destiny of Ireland then as now. The poor\r\nvacillating, double-dealing king was delivered to the Puritans, tried,\r\nand executed. But before Cromwell came to smash the confederation and\r\neverything papal in Ireland, the Irish chief gladdened the hearts of\r\nhis countrymen by the glorious victory of Benburb, one of the most\r\nmemorable in Irish history.\r\n\r\nIn a naturally strong position, the Irish, for four hours, received\r\nand repulsed the various charges of the Puritan horse. Then as the\r\nsun began to descend, pouring its rays upon the enemy, O'Neill led\r\nhis whole force--five thousand men against eight--to the attack.\r\nOne terrible onset swept away every trace of resistance. There were\r\ncounted on the field 3,243 of the Covenanters, and of the Catholics\r\nbut 70 killed and 100 wounded. Lord Ardes, and 21 Scottish officers,\r\n32 standards, 1,500 draught horses, and all the guns and tents, were\r\ncaptured. Monroe fled to Lisburn and thence to Carrickfergus, where he\r\nshut himself up till he could obtain reinforcements. O'Neill forwarded\r\nthe captured colours to the Nuncio at Limerick, by whom they were\r\nsolemnly placed in the choir of St. Mary's Cathedral, and afterwards,\r\nat the request of Pope Innocent, sent to Rome. The _Te Deum_ was\r\nchanted in the confederate capital; penitential psalms were sung\r\nin the northern fortresses. 'The Lord of Hosts,' wrote Monroe,\r\n'has rubbed shame on our faces till once we are humbled.' O'Neill\r\nemblazoned the cross and keys on his banner with the Red Hand\r\nof Ulster, and openly resumed the title originally chosen by his\r\nadherents at Clones, 'the Catholic Army.'\r\n\r\nThe stage of Irish politics now presented the most extraordinary\r\ncomplications political and military. The confederation was occupied\r\nwith endless debates and dissensions. Commanders changed positions so\r\nrapidly, the several causes for which men had been fighting became so\r\nconfused in the unaccountable scene-shifting, giving glimpses now of\r\nthe king, now of the commonwealth, and now of the pope, that no one\r\nknew what to do, or what was to be the end. The nuncio went home in\r\ndisgust that his blessings and his curses, which he dispensed with\r\nequal liberality, had so little effect.\r\n\r\nAt length appeared an actor who gave a terrible unity to the drama of\r\nIrish politics. Cromwell left London in July 1649, 'in a coach drawn\r\nby six gallant Flanders mares,' and made a grand progress to Bristol.\r\nHe landed at Ring's End, near Dublin, on August 14. He entered the\r\ncity in procession and addressed the people from 'a convenient place,'\r\naccompanied by his son Henry, Blake, Jones, Ireton, Ludlow, Hardress,\r\nWaller, and others. The history of Cromwell's military exploits in\r\nIreland is well known. I pass on, therefore, to notice the effects of\r\nthe war on the condition of the people.\r\n\r\nAs usual, in such cases, the destruction of the crops and other\r\nprovisions by the soldiers, brought evil to the conquerors as well as\r\nto their victims. There had been a fifteen years' war in Ulster,\r\nwhen James I. ascended the throne, and it left the country waste\r\nand desolate. Sir John Davis, his attorney-general, asserted the\r\nunquestionable fact that perpetual war had been continued between the\r\ntwo nations for 'four hundred and odd years,' and had always for its\r\nobject to 'root out the Irish.' James was to put an end to this war,\r\nand, as we have seen, the lord deputy promised the people 'estates' in\r\ntheir holdings. The effect of this promise, as recorded by Davis,\r\nis remarkable. 'He thus made it a year of jubilee to the poor\r\ninhabitants, because every man was to return to his own house, and\r\nbe restored to his ancient possessions, and they all went home\r\nrejoicing.'\r\n\r\nPoor people! they soon saw the folly of putting their trust in\r\nprinces. Now, after a seven years' war, the nation was again\r\nvisited with famine, and the country converted into a wilderness.\r\nThree-fourths of the cattle had been destroyed; and the commissioners\r\nfor Ireland reported to the council in England in 1651, that four\r\nparts in five of the best and most fertile land in Ireland lay waste\r\nand uninhabited, stating that they had encouraged the Irish to till\r\nthe land, promising them the enjoyment of the crops. They had also\r\ngiven orders 'for enforcing those that were removed to the mountains\r\nto return.' The soldiers were employed to till the lands round their\r\nposts. Corn had to be imported to Dublin from Wales. So scarce\r\nwas meat that a widow was obliged to petition the authorities for\r\npermission to kill a lamb; and she was 'permitted and lycensed to kill\r\nand dresse so much lambe as shall be necessary for her own eating,\r\nnot exceeding three lambes for this whole year, notwithstanding\r\nany declaration of the said Commissioners of Parliament to the\r\ncontrary.'[A] This privilege was granted to Mrs. Buckley in\r\nconsideration of 'her old age and weakness of body.' In 1654 the Irish\r\nrevenue from all sources was only 198,000 l., while the cost of the\r\narmy was 500,000 l. A sort of conditional amnesty was granted from\r\nnecessity, pending the decision of Parliament, and on May 12,\r\n1652, the Leinster army of the Irish surrendered on terms signed\r\nat Kilkenny, which were adopted successively by the other principal\r\narmies between that time and the September following, when the Ulster\r\nforces surrendered. By these Kilkenny articles, all except those who\r\nwere guilty of the first blood were received into protection on\r\nlaying down their arms; those who should not be satisfied with the\r\nconclusions the Parliament might come to concerning the Irish nation,\r\nand should desire to transport themselves with their men to serve any\r\nforeign state in amity with the Parliament, should have liberty\r\nto treat with their agents for that purpose. But the Commissioners\r\nundertook faithfully to mediate with the Parliament that they\r\nmight enjoy such a remnant of their lands as might make their lives\r\ncomfortable at home, or be enabled to emigrate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prendergast, the Cromwellian Settlement, p.16.]\r\n\r\nThe Cromwellian administration in Ireland effected a revolution\r\nunparalleled in history. Its proceedings have been well summarised by\r\nMr. Darcy Magee:--\r\n\r\nThe Long Parliament, still dragging out its days under the shadow of\r\nCromwell's great name, declared in its session of 1652 the rebellion\r\nin Ireland 'subdued and ended,' and proceeded to legislate for that\r\nkingdom as a conquered country. On August 12 they passed their Act of\r\nSettlement, the authorship of which was attributed to Lord Orrery, in\r\nthis respect the worthy son of the first Earl of Cork. Under this act\r\nthere were four chief descriptions of persons whose status was thus\r\nsettled: 1. All ecclesiastics and royalist proprietors were exempted\r\nfrom pardon of life or estate. 2. All royalist commissioned officers\r\nwere condemned to banishment, and the forfeit of two-thirds of their\r\nproperty, one-third being retained for the support of their wives and\r\nchildren. 3. Those who had not been in arms, but could be shown, by\r\na parliamentary commission, to have manifested 'a constant, good\r\naffection' to the war, were to forfeit one-third of their estates,\r\nand receive 'an equivalent' for the remaining two-thirds west of\r\nthe Shannon. 4. All husbandmen and others of the inferior sort, 'not\r\npossessed of lands or goods exceeding the value of 10 l.,' were to\r\nhave a free pardon, on condition also of transporting themselves\r\nacross the Shannon.\r\n\r\nThis last condition of the Cromwellian settlement distinguished it,\r\nin our annals, from every other proscription of the native population\r\nformerly attempted. The great river of Ireland, rising in the\r\nmountains of Leitrim, nearly severs the five western counties from the\r\nrest of the kingdom. The province thus set apart, though one of the\r\nlargest in superficial extent, had also the largest proportion of\r\nwaste and water, mountain and moorland. The new inhabitants were there\r\nto congregate from all the other provinces before the first day of\r\nMay, 1654, under penalty of outlawry and all its consequences; and\r\nwhen there, they were not to appear within two miles of the Shannon,\r\nor four miles of the sea. A rigorous passport system, to evade which\r\nwas death without form of trial, completed this settlement, the design\r\nof which was to shut up the remaining Catholic inhabitants from all\r\nintercourse with mankind, and all communion with the other inhabitants\r\nof their own country.\r\n\r\nA new survey of the whole kingdom was also ordered, under the\r\ndirection of Dr. William Petty, the fortunate economist who founded\r\nthe house of Lansdowne. By him the surface of the kingdom was\r\nestimated at 10,500,000 plantation acres, three of which were deducted\r\nfor waste and water. Of the remainder, above 5,000,000 were in\r\nCatholic hands, in 1641; 300,000 were church and college lands; and\r\n2,000,000 were in possession of the Protestant settlers of the reigns\r\nof James and Elizabeth. Under the Protectorate, 5,000,000 acres were\r\nconfiscated; this enormous spoil, two-thirds of the whole island, went\r\nto the soldiers and adventurers who had served against the Irish,\r\nor had contributed to the military chest, since 1641--except 700,000\r\nacres given in 'exchange' to the banished in Clare and Connaught;\r\nand 1,200,000 confirmed to 'innocent Papists.' Such was the complete\r\nuprooting of the ancient tenantry or clansmen from their original\r\nholdings, that, during the survey, orders of parliament were issued to\r\nbring back individuals from Connaught to point out the boundaries of\r\nparishes in Munster. It cannot be imputed among the sins so freely\r\nlaid to the historical account of the native legislature, that\r\nan Irish parliament had any share in sanctioning this universal\r\nspoliation. Cromwell anticipated the union of the kingdoms by 150\r\nyears, when he summoned, in 1653, that assembly over which 'Praise-God\r\nBarebones' presided; members for Ireland and Scotland sat on the same\r\nbenches with the commons of England. Oliver's first deputy in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland was his son-in-law Fleetwood, who had married\r\nthe widow of Ireton; but his real representative was his fourth son\r\nHenry Cromwell, commander-in-chief of the army. In 1657, the title of\r\nlord deputy was transferred from Fleetwood to Henry, who united the\r\nsupreme civil and military authority in his own person until the eve\r\nof the restoration, of which he became an active partisan. We may thus\r\nproperly embrace the five years of the Protectorate as a period of\r\nHenry Cromwell's administration.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a parliament, the government of Ireland was vested\r\nin the deputy, the commander-in-chief, and four commissioners, Ludlow,\r\nCorbett, Jones, and Weaver. There was, moreover, a high court of\r\njustice, which perambulated the kingdom, and exercised an absolute\r\nauthority over life and property greater than even Strafford's Court\r\nof Star Chamber had pretended to. Over this court presided Lord\r\nLowther, assisted by Mr. Justice Donnellan, by Cooke, solicitor to the\r\nparliament on the trial of King Charles, and the regicide Reynolds.\r\nBy this court, Sir Phelim O'Neill, Viscount Mayo, and Colonels O'Toole\r\nand Bagnall were condemned and executed; children of both sexes were\r\ncaptured by thousands, and sold as slaves to the tobacco-planters of\r\nVirginia and the West Indies. Sir William Petty states that 6,000 boys\r\nand girls were sent to those islands. The number, of all ages, thus\r\ntransported, was estimated at 100,000 souls. As to the 'swordsmen'\r\nwho had been trained to fighting, Petty, in his _Political Anatomy_,\r\nrecords that 'the chiefest and most eminentest of the nobility and\r\nmany of the gentry had taken conditions from the King of Spain,\r\nand had transported 40,000 of the most active, spirited men, most\r\nacquainted with the dangers and discipline of war.' The chief\r\ncommissioners in Dublin had despatched assistant commissioners to the\r\nprovinces. The distribution which they made of the soil was nearly\r\nas complete as that of Canaan among the Israelites; and this was\r\nthe model which the Puritans had always before their minds. Where a\r\nmiserable residue of the population was required to till the land\r\nfor its new owners, they were tolerated as the Gibeonites had been by\r\nJoshua. Irish gentlemen who had obtained pardons were obliged to\r\nwear a distinctive mark on their dress on pain of death. Persons of\r\ninferior rank were distinguished by a black spot on the right cheek.\r\nWanting this, their punishment was the branding-iron or the gallows.\r\n\r\nNo vestige of the Catholic religion was allowed to exist. Catholic\r\nlawyers and schoolmasters were silenced. All ecclesiastics were slain\r\nlike the priests of Baal. Three bishops and 300 of the inferior clergy\r\nthus perished. The bedridden Bishop of Kilmore was the only native\r\nclergyman permitted to survive. If, in mountain recesses or caves, a\r\nfew peasants were detected at mass, they were smoked out and shot.\r\n\r\nThus England got rid of a race concerning which Mr. Prendergast found\r\nthis contemporary testimony in a MS. in Trinity College library,\r\nDublin, dated 1615:--\r\n\r\n'There lives not a people more hardy, active, and painful ... neither\r\nis there any will endure the miseries of warre, as famine, watching,\r\nheat, cold, wet, travel, and the like, so naturally and with such\r\nfacility and courage that they do. The Prince of Orange's excellency\r\nuses often publiquely to deliver that the Irish are souldiers the\r\nfirst day of their birth. The famous Henry IV., late king of France,\r\nsaid there would prove no nation so resolute martial men as they,\r\nwould they be ruly and not too headstrong. And Sir John Norris was\r\nwont to ascribe this particular to that nation above others, that he\r\nnever beheld so few of any country as of Irish that were idiots and\r\ncowards, which is very notable.'\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1653, the parliament made a division of the spoil among\r\nthe conquerors and the adventurers; and, on September 26, an act was\r\npassed for the new planting of Ireland by English. The Government\r\nreserved for itself the towns, the church lands, and the tithes, the\r\nestablished church, hierarchy and all, having been utterly abolished.\r\nThe four counties of Dublin, Kildare, Carlow, and Cork were also\r\nreserved. The amount due to the adventurers was 360,000 l. This they\r\ndivided into three lots, of which 110,000 l. was to be satisfied in\r\nMunster, 205,000 l. in Leinster, and 45,000 l. in Ulster, and the\r\nmoiety of ten counties was charged with their payment--Waterford,\r\nLimerick, and Tipperary, in Munster; Meath, Westmeath, King's and\r\nQueen's Counties, in Leinster; and Antrim, Down, and Armagh, in\r\nUlster. But, as all was required by the Adventurers Act to be done by\r\nlot, a lottery was appointed to be held in Grocers' Hall, London, for\r\nJuly 20, 1653, to begin at 8 o'clock in the morning, when lots should\r\nbe first drawn in which province each adventurer was to be satisfied,\r\nnot exceeding the specified amounts in any province; lots were to\r\nbe drawn, secondly, to ascertain in which of the ten counties\r\neach adventurer was to receive his land--the lots not to exceed in\r\nWestmeath 70,000 l., in Tipperary 60,000 l., in Meath 55,000 l., in\r\nKing's and Queen's Counties 40,000 l. each, in Limerick 30,000 l., in\r\nWaterford 20,000 l., in Antrim, Down, and Armagh 15,000 l. each. And,\r\nas it was thought it would be a great encouragement to the adventurers\r\n(who were for the most part merchants and tradesmen), about to plant\r\nin so wild and dangerous a country, not yet subdued, to have soldier\r\nplanters near them, these ten counties, when surveyed (which was\r\ndirected to be done immediately, and returned to the committee for\r\nthe lottery at Grocers' Hall), were to be divided, each county by\r\nbaronies, into two moieties, as equally as might be, without dividing\r\nany barony. A lot was then to be drawn by the adventurers, and by\r\nsome officer appointed by the Lord General Cromwell on behalf of the\r\nsoldiery, to ascertain which baronies in the ten counties should be\r\nfor the adventurers, and which for the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Ireland, except Connaught, was to be set out amongst the\r\nofficers and soldiers for their arrears, amounting to 1,550,000 l.,\r\nand to satisfy debts of money or provisions due for supplies advanced\r\nto the army of the commonwealth amounting to 1,750,000 l. Connaught\r\nbeing by the parliament reserved and appointed for the habitation of\r\nthe Irish nation, all English and Protestants having lands there, who\r\nshould desire to remove out of Connaught into the provinces inhabited\r\nby the English, were to receive estates in the English parts, of equal\r\nvalue, in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to clear out the remnant of the inhabitants,\r\nand the overture to this performance was the following merciful\r\nproclamation:--\r\n\r\n'The Parliament of the Commonwealth of England having by one act\r\nlately passed (entitled an Act for the Settling of Ireland) declared\r\nthat _it is not their intention to extirpate this whole nation_,\r\nbut that mercy and pardon for life and estate be extended to all\r\nhusbandmen, plowmen, labourers, artificers, and others of the inferior\r\nsort, in such manner as in and by the said Act is set forth: for the\r\nbetter execution of the said Act, and that timely notice may be given\r\nto all persons therein concerned, it is ordered that the Governor and\r\nCommissioners of Revenue, or any two or more of them, within every\r\nprecinct in this nation, do cause the said Act of Parliament with this\r\npresent declaration to be published and proclaimed in their respective\r\nprecincts _by beat of drumme and sound of trumpett_, on some markett\r\nday, within tenn days after the same shall come unto them within their\r\nrespective precincts.\r\n\r\n'Dated at the Castle of Kilkenny, this 11th October, 1652.\r\n\r\n  'EDMUND LUDLOW,   MILES CORBET,\r\n  'JOHN JONES,      R. WEAVER.'\r\n\r\nA letter from Dublin, dated December 21, 1654, four days before\r\nChristmas, says the 'transplantation is now far advanced, the men\r\nbeing gone to prepare their new habitations in Connaught. Their wives\r\nand children and dependants have been, and are, packing away after\r\nthem apace, and all are to be gone by the 1st of March next.' In\r\nanother letter the writer _naïvely_ remarks, 'It is the nature of this\r\npeople to be rebellious, and they have been so much the more disposed\r\nto it, having been highly exasperated to it by the transplanting\r\nwork.' The temper of the settlers towards the natives may be inferred\r\nfrom a petition to the lord deputy and council of Ireland, praying for\r\nthe enforcement of the original order requiring the removal of all\r\nthe Irish nation into Connaught, except boys of fourteen and girls\r\nof twelve. 'For we humbly conceive,' say the petitioners, 'that the\r\nproclamation for transplanting only the proprietors, and such as have\r\nbeen in arms, will neither answer the end of safety nor what else is\r\naimed at thereby. For the first purpose of the transplantation is\r\nto prevent those of natural principles' (i.e. of natural affections)\r\n'becoming one with these Irish, as well in affinity as idolatry, as\r\nmany thousands did who came over in Elizabeth's time, many of which\r\nhave had a deep hand in all the late murders and massacres. And shall\r\nwe join in affinity,' they ask, 'with a people of these abominations?\r\nWould not the Lord be angry with us till He consumes us, having\r\nsaid--\"the land which ye go to possess is an unclean land, because\r\nof the filthiness of the people who dwell therein. Ye shall not,\r\ntherefore, give your sons to their daughters, nor take their daughters\r\nto your sons,\" as it is in Ezra ix. 11, 12, 14. \"Nay, ye shall surely\r\nroot them out, lest they cause you to forsake the Lord your God.\"\r\nDeut. c. vii. &c.'\r\n\r\nIn this way they hoped that 'honest men' would be encouraged to come\r\nand live amongst them, because the other three provinces (that is, all\r\nthe island but Connaught) would be free of 'tories,' when there was\r\nnone left to harbour or relieve them. They would have made a clean\r\nsweep of Munster, Leinster, and Ulster, so that 'the saints' might\r\ninherit the land without molestation. If any Protestant friends of the\r\nIrish objected to this thorough mode of effecting the work of Irish\r\nregeneration, Colonel Lawrence 'doubted not but God would enable that\r\nauthority yet in being to let out that dram of rebellious bloud, and\r\ncure that fit of sullenness their advocate speaks of.'\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to effect the transplantation were\r\npainfully conscious of their unworthiness to perform so holy a work,\r\nand Were overwhelmed with a sense of their weakness in the midst of\r\nsuch tremendous difficulties, so that they were constrained to say:\r\n'The child is now come to the birth, and much is desired and expected,\r\nbut there is no strength to bring forth.' They therefore fasted and\r\nhumbled themselves before the Lord, inviting the officers of the army\r\nto join them in lifting up prayers, 'with strong crying and tears,\r\nto Him to whom nothing is too strong, that His servants, whom He had\r\ncalled forth in this day to act in these great transactions, might be\r\nmade faithful, and carried on by His own outstretched arm, against all\r\nopposition and difficulty, to do what was pleasing in His sight.'\r\n\r\nIt is true they had this consolation, 'that the chiefest and\r\neminentest of the nobility and many of the gentry had taken conditions\r\nfrom the king of Spain, and had transported 40,000 of the most active,\r\nspirited men, most acquainted with the dangers and discipline of war.'\r\nThe priests were all banished. The remaining part of the whole nation\r\nwas scarce one-sixth of what they were at the beginning of the war, so\r\ngreat a devastation had God and man brought upon that land; and that\r\nhandful of natives left were poor labourers, simple creatures, whose\r\nsole design was to live and maintain their families.'\r\n\r\nOf course there were many exceptions to this rule. There were some of\r\nthe upper classes remaining, described in the certificates which all\r\nthe emigrants were obliged to procure, like Sir Nicholas Comyn, of\r\nLimerick, 'who was numb at one side of his body of a dead palsy,\r\naccompanied only by his lady, Catherine Comyn, aged thirty-five years,\r\nflaxen-haired, middle stature; and one maid servant, Honor M'Namara,\r\naged twenty years, brown hair, middle stature, having no substance,'\r\n&c. From Tipperary went forth James, Lord Dunboyne, with 21 followers,\r\nand having 4 cows, 10 garrons, and 2 swine. Dame Catherine Morris, 35\r\nfollowers, 10 cows, 16 garrons, 19 goats, 2 swine. Lady Mary Hamilton,\r\nof Roscrea, with 45 persons, 40 cows, 30 garrons, 46 sheep, 2 goats.\r\nPierce, Lord Viscount Ikerrin, with 17 persons, having 16 acres of\r\nwinter corn, 4 cows, 5 garrons, 14 sheep, 2 swine, &c. There were\r\nother noblemen, lords of the Pale, descended from illustrious English\r\nancestors, the Fitzgeralds, the Butlers, the Plunkets, the Barnwells,\r\nthe Dillons, the Cheevers, the Cusacks, &c., who petitioned, praying\r\nthat their flight might not be in the winter, or alleging that their\r\nwives and children were sick, that their cattle were unfit to drive,\r\nor that they had crops to get in. To them dispensations were granted,\r\nprovided the husbands and parents were in Connaught building huts,\r\n&c., and that not more than one or two servants remained behind to\r\nlook after the respective herds and flocks, and to attend to the\r\ngathering in and threshing of the corn. And some few, such as John\r\nTalbot de Malahide, got a pass for safe travelling from Connaught\r\nto come back, in order to dispose of their corn and goods, giving\r\nsecurity to return within the time limited. If they did not return\r\nthey got this warning in the month of March--that the officers had\r\nresolved to fill the jails with them, 'by which this bloody people\r\nwill know that they (the officers) are not degenerated from English\r\nprinciples. Though I presume we should be very tender of hanging any\r\nexcept leading men, yet we shall make no scruple of sending them\r\nto the West Indies,' &c. Accordingly when the time came, all the\r\nremaining crops were seized and sold; there was a general arrest of\r\nall 'transplantable persons. All over the three provinces, men and\r\nwomen were hauled out of their beds in the dead hour of night to\r\nprison, till the jails were choked.' In order to further expedite\r\nthe removal of the nobility and gentry, a court-martial sat in St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral, and ordered the lingering delinquents, who shrunk\r\nfrom going to Connaught, to be hanged, with a placard on the breast\r\nand back of each victim--'_For not transplanting.'_\r\n\r\nScully's conduct at Ballycohy, was universally execrated. But what did\r\nhe attempt to do? Just what the Cromwellian officers did at the end\r\nof a horrid civil war 200 years ago, with this difference in favour of\r\nCromwell, that Scully did not purpose to 'transplant,' He would simply\r\nuproot, leaving the uprooted to perish on the highway. His conduct was\r\nas barbarous as that of the Cromwellian officers. But what of Scully?\r\nHe is nothing. The all-important fact is, that, in playing a part\r\nworse than Cromwellian, he, _acting according to English law, was\r\nsupported by all the power of the state_; and if the men who defended\r\ntheir homes against his attack had been arrested and convicted, Irish\r\njudges would have consigned them to the gallows; and they might, as\r\nin the Cromwellian case, have ordered a placard to be put on their\r\npersons:--\r\n\r\n    'FOR NOT TRANSPLANTING!'\r\n\r\nIn fact the Cromwellian commissioners did nothing more than carry out\r\nfully the _principles_ of our present land code. Nine-tenths of the\r\nsoil of Ireland are held by tenants at will. It is constantly argued\r\nin the leading organs of English opinion, that the power of the\r\nlandlords to resume possession of their estates, and turn them into\r\npastures, evicting all the tenants, is _essential_ to the rights of\r\nproperty. This has been said in connection with the great absentee\r\nproprietors. According to this theory of proprietorship, the only one\r\nrecognised by law, Lord Lansdowne may legally spread desolation over a\r\nlarge part of Kerry; Lord Fitzwilliam may send the ploughshare of ruin\r\nthrough the hearths of half the county Wicklow; Lord Digby, in the\r\nKing's County, may restore to the bog of Allen vast tracts reclaimed\r\nduring many generations by the labour of his tenants; and Lord\r\nHertfort may convert into a wilderness the district which the\r\ndescendants of the English settlers have converted into the garden\r\nof Ulster. If any or all of those noblemen took a fancy, like Colonel\r\nBernard of Kinnitty or Mr. Allen Pollok, to become graziers and\r\ncattle-jobbers on a gigantic scale, the Government would be compelled\r\nto place the military power of the state at their disposal, to evict\r\nthe whole population in the queen's name, to drive all the families\r\naway from their homes, to demolish their dwellings, and turn them\r\nadrift on the highway, without one shilling compensation. Villages,\r\nschools, churches would all disappear from the landscape; and, when\r\nthe grouse season arrived, the noble owner might bring over a party of\r\nEnglish friends to see his '_improvements!_' The right of conquest\r\nso cruelly exercised by the Cromwellians is in this year of grace _a\r\nlegal right_; and its exercise is a mere question of expediency and\r\ndiscretion. There is not a landlord in Ireland who may not be a Scully\r\nif he wishes. It is not law or justice, it is not British power, that\r\nprevents the enactment of Cromwellian scenes of desolation in\r\nevery county of that unfortunate country. It is self-interest, with\r\nhumanity, in the hearts of good men, and the dread of assassination\r\nin the hearts of bad men, that prevent at the present moment the\r\nimmolation of the Irish people to the Moloch of territorial despotism.\r\nIt is the effort to render impossible those human sacrifices, those\r\nholocausts of Christian households, that the priests of\r\nfeudal landlordism denounce so frantically with loud cries of\r\n'_confiscation_.'\r\n\r\nThe 'graces' promised by Charles I. in 1628 demonstrate the real\r\nwretchedness of the country to which they were deceitfully offered,\r\nand from which they were treacherously withdrawn. From them we learn\r\nthat the Government soldiers were a terror to more than the king's\r\nenemies, that the king's rents were collected at the sword's point,\r\nand that numerous monopolies and oppressive taxes impoverished the\r\ncountry. There was little security for estates in any part of Ireland,\r\nand none at all for estates in Connaught. No man could sue out livery\r\nfor his lands without first taking the oath of the royal supremacy.\r\nThe soldiers enjoyed an immunity in the perpetration of even capital\r\ncrimes, for the civil power could not touch them. Those who were\r\nmarried, or had their children baptized, by Roman Catholic priests,\r\nwere liable to fine and censure. The Protestant bishops and clergy\r\nwere in great favour and had enormous privileges. The patentees of\r\ndissolved religious houses claimed exemption from various assessments.\r\nThe ministers of the Established Church were entitled to the aid of\r\nthe Government in exacting reparation for clandestine exercises of\r\nspiritual jurisdiction by Roman Catholic priests, and actually appear\r\nto have kept private prisons of their own. They exacted tithes from\r\nRoman Catholics of everything titheable. The eels of the rivers and\r\nlakes, the fishes of the sea paid them toll. The dead furnished the\r\nmortuary fees to the 'alien church' in the shape of the best clothes\r\nwhich the wardrobe of the defunct afforded. The government of\r\nWentworth, better known as the Earl of Strafford, is highly praised by\r\nhigh churchmen and admirers of Laud, but was execrated by the Irish,\r\nwho failed to appreciate the mercies of his star-chamber court, or to\r\nrecognise the justice of his fining juries who returned disagreeable\r\nverdicts. The list of grievances, transmitted by the Irish House\r\nof Peers in 1641 to the English Government, cannot be regarded as\r\naltogether visionary, for it was vouched by the names of lords,\r\nspiritual and temporal, whose attachment to the English interest was\r\nundoubted. The lord chancellor (Loftus), the archbishop of Dublin\r\n(Bulkeley), the bishops of Meath, Clogher, and Killala were no rebels,\r\nand yet they protested against the grievances inflicted on Ireland by\r\nthe tyranny of Strafford. According to these contemporary witnesses,\r\nthe Irish nobles had been taxed beyond all proportion to the English\r\nnobles; Irish peers had been sent to prison although not impeached\r\nof treason or any capital offence; the deputy had managed to keep all\r\nproxies of peers in the hands of his creatures, and thus to sway the\r\nUpper House to his will; the trade of the kingdom had been destroyed;\r\nand the 'graces' of 1628 had been denied to the nation, or clogged by\r\nprovisoes which rendered them a mockery. And yet, in the face of\r\nsuch evidence of misery and misgovernment, the Archbishop of Dublin\r\nasserted in a charge to his clergy, that 'all contemporary writers\r\nagree in describing the flourishing condition of the island, and its\r\nrapid advance in civilisation and wealth, when all its improvement\r\nwas brought to an end by the catastrophe of the Irish rebellion of\r\n1641'--the very year in which the Irish Houses of Lords and Commons\r\nagreed in depicting the condition of Ireland as utterly miserable!\r\n\r\nBut Archbishop Trench not only contradicts the authentic contemporary\r\nrecords, in picturing as halcyon days one of the most wretched periods\r\nof Irish history, but also wrongfully represents one of the saddest\r\nepisodes of that history. He reminded his clergy 'that the number\r\nof Protestants who were massacred by the Roman Catholics during the\r\nrebellion was, by the most moderate estimate, set down as 40,000.' His\r\ngrace seems to have been unacquainted with the contemporary evidence\r\ncollected by the Protestant historian Warner, who examined the\r\ndepositions of 1641, on which the story of the massacre was based, and\r\nfound the estimate of those who perished in the so-called massacre to\r\nhave been enormously exaggerated. He calculated the number of those\r\nkilled, 'upon evidence collected within two years after the rebellion\r\nbroke out,' at 4,028, besides 8,000 said to have perished through bad\r\nusage. The parliament commissioners in Dublin, writing in 1652 to the\r\ncommissioners in England, say that, 'besides 848 families, there\r\nwere killed, hanged, burned, and drowned 6,062. Thus there were two\r\nestimates--one of 12,000, the other of 10,000--each of which was far\r\nlower than the estimate of 40,000, which his grace calls 'the\r\nmost moderate.' It turns out, moreover, that the argument based by\r\nArchbishop Trench on the false estimate of those said to have been\r\nmassacred, is wholly worthless for the purpose intended by his grace.\r\nThe disproportion of Protestants to Roman Catholics, which appears\r\nby the census of 1861, cannot be accounted for by the statistics\r\nof 1641--be those statistics true or false. For the proportion of\r\nProtestants to Roman Catholics was higher in 1672--thirty years after\r\nthe alleged massacre--than in 1861. The Protestants in 1672, according\r\nto Sir W. Petty, numbered 300,000, and the Roman Catholics 800,000;\r\nwhile in 1861 there were found in Ireland only 1,293,702 Protestants\r\nof all denominations to 4,505,265 Roman Catholics. It follows from\r\nthese figures, as has been already remarked by Dr. Maziere Brady, that\r\nthere has been a relative decrease of Protestants, as compared with\r\nRoman Catholics, of 395,772 persons. And this relative decrease was in\r\nno way affected--inasmuch as it took place since the year 1672--by the\r\nalleged massacre of 1641.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PURITAN PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fearful thing to undertake the destruction of a nation\r\nby slaughter, starvation, and banishment. When we read of such\r\nenormities, perpetrated by some 'scourge of God,' in heathen lands and\r\ndistant ages, we are horrified, and we thank Providence that it is our\r\nlot to be born in a Christian country. But what must the world think\r\nof our Christianity when they read of the things that, in a most\r\nBible-reading age, Englishmen did in Ireland?\r\n\r\nThe work of transplanting was slow, difficult, and intensely painful\r\nto the Irish, for Connaught was bleak, sterile, and desolate, and the\r\nweather was inclement. The natural protectors of many families had\r\nbeen killed or banished, and the women and children clung with frantic\r\nfondness to their old homes. But for the feelings of such afflicted\r\nones the conquerors had no sympathy. On the contrary, they believed\r\nthat God, angry at their lingering, sent his judgments as a\r\npunishment. Mr. Prendergast has published a number of letters, written\r\nat the time by the English authorities and others, from which some\r\ninteresting matters may be gleaned. The town of Cashel had got a\r\ndispensation to remain. 'But,' says the writer, 'the Lord, who is a\r\njealous God, and more knowing of, as well as jealous against their\r\niniquity than we, by a fire on the 23rd inst. hath burned down the\r\nwhole town in little less than a quarter of an hour, except a few\r\nhouses that a few English lived in,' &c. In consequence of the delay,\r\nthe Irish began to break into 'torying' (plundering). 'The tories fly\r\nout and increase. What strange people, not to starve in peace.' To\r\nbe inclined to plunder under such circumstances, with so gracious a\r\nGovernment, must be held to be a proof of great natural depravity, as\r\nwell as of a peculiar incapacity to respect, or even to understand,\r\nthe rights of property.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, the land was ready for the enjoyment of the\r\nofficers and soldiers. On August 20, 1655, the lord deputy, Fleetwood,\r\nthus addressed one of the officers:--\r\n\r\n'Sir,--In pursuance of his highness's command, the council here\r\nwith myself and chief officers of the army having concluded about\r\ndisbanding part of the army, in order to lessening the present charge,\r\nit is fit that your troope be one. And, accordingly, I desire you\r\nwould march such as are willing to plant of them into the barony of\r\nShelmaliere, in the county of Wexford, at or before the first day of\r\nSeptember, where you shall be put into possession of your lands, for\r\nyour arrears, according to the rates agreed on by the committee and\r\nagents. As also you shall have, upon the place wherein you are, so\r\nmuch money as shall answer the present three months' arrear due to you\r\nand your men, but to continue no longer the pay of the army than upon\r\nthe muster of this August. The sooner you march your men the better;\r\nthereby you will be enabled to make provision for the winter.' After\r\nsome sweetening hints that they will be perhaps paid hereafter as a\r\nmilitia he concludes:--\r\n\r\n'And great is your mercy, that after all your hardships and\r\ndifficulties you may sit down, and, if the Lord give His blessing, may\r\nreape some fruits of your past services. Do not think it a blemish\r\nor underrating of your past services, that you are now disbanded; but\r\nlook upon it as of the Lord's appointing, and with cheerfulness submit\r\nthereunto; and the blessing of the Lord be upon you all, and keep you\r\nin His fear, and give you hearts to observe your past experience of\r\nsignal appearances. And that this fear may be seen in your hearts, and\r\nthat you may be kept from the sins and pollutions which God hath so\r\neminently witnessed against in those whose possessions you are to take\r\nup, is the desire of him who is\r\n\r\n  'Your very affectionate friend, to love and serve you,\r\n\r\n  'CHARLES FLEETWOOD.'\r\n\r\nHe congratulated them that, 'having by the blessing of God obtained\r\ntheir peace, they might sit down in the enjoyment of the enemies'\r\nfields and houses, which they planted not nor built not. They had no\r\nreason to repent their services, considering how great an issue God\r\nhad given.' Yet many refused to settle, and sold their debentures to\r\ntheir officers. What could they do with the farms? They had no horses\r\nor ploughs, no cattle to stock the land, no labourers to till it.\r\nAbove all, they had no women. Flogging was the punishment for amours\r\nwith Irish girls, and marriage with the idolatrous race was forbidden\r\nunder heavy penalties. Hence the soldiers pretended that their wives\r\nwere converted to Protestantism. But this was to be tested by a strict\r\nexamination of each as to the state of her soul, and the means by\r\nwhich she had been enlightened. If she did not stand the test, her\r\nhusband was degraded in rank, and, if disbanded, he was liable to\r\nbe sent to Connaught with the fair seducer. The charms of the Irish\r\nwomen, however, proved irresistible, and the hearts of the pious\r\nrulers were sorely troubled by this danger.\r\n\r\n'In 1652, amongst the first plans for paying the army their arrears\r\nin land, it was suggested there should be a law that any officers or\r\nsoldiers marrying Irishwomen should lose their commands, forfeit their\r\narrears, and be made incapable of inheriting lands in Ireland. No such\r\nprovision, however, was introduced into the act, because it provided\r\nagainst this danger more effectually by ordering the women to\r\ntransplant, together with the whole nation, to Connaught. Those in\r\nauthority, however, ought never to have let the English officers and\r\nsoldiers come in contact with the Irishwomen, or should have ordered\r\nanother army of young Englishwomen over, if they did not intend this\r\nprovision to be nugatory. Planted in a wasted country, amongst the\r\nformer owners and their families, with little to do but to make love,\r\nand no lips to make love to but Irish, love or marriage must follow\r\nbetween them as necessarily as a geometrical conclusion follows\r\nfrom the premises. For there were but few who (in the language of a\r\nCromwellian patriot),\r\n\r\n  ----'rather than turne\r\n  From English principles, would sooner burne;\r\n  And rather than marrie an Irish wife,\r\n  Would batchellers remain for tearme of life.'\r\n\r\nAbout forty years after the Cromwellian Settlement, and just seven\r\nyears after the Battle of the Boyne, the following was written: 'We\r\ncannot so much wonder at this [the quick \"degenerating\" of the English\r\nof Ireland], when we consider how many there are of the children of\r\nOliver's soldiers in Ireland who cannot speak one word of English.\r\nAnd (which is strange) the same may be said of some of the children\r\nof King William's soldiers who came but t'other day into the country.\r\nThis misfortune is owing to the marrying Irishwomen for want of\r\nEnglish, who come not over in so great numbers as are requisite. 'Tis\r\nsure that no Englishman in Ireland knows what his children may be as\r\nthings are now; they cannot well live in the country without growing\r\nIrish; for none take such care as Sir Jerome Alexander [second justice\r\nof the Common Pleas in Ireland from 1661 to his death in 1670], who\r\nleft his estate to his daughter, but made the gift void if she married\r\nany Irishman;' Sir Jerome including in this term 'any lord of Ireland,\r\nany archbishop, bishop, prelate, any baronet, knight, esquire, or\r\ngentleman of Irish extraction or descent, born and bred in Ireland, or\r\nhaving his relations and means of subsistence there,' and expressly,\r\nof course, any 'Papist.'--'True Way to render Ireland happy and\r\nsecure; or, a Discourse, wherein 'tis shown that 'tis the interest\r\nboth of England and Ireland to encourage foreign Protestants to plant\r\nin Ireland; in a letter to the Hon. Robert Molesworth.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cromwellian Settlement, p.130.]\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of getting a sufficient number of settlers from\r\nEngland to cultivate the land, produce food, and render the estates\r\nworth holding, led to some fraudulent transactions for the benefit\r\nof the natives who were 'loath to leave.' The officers in various\r\ncounties got general orders giving dispensations from the necessity\r\nof planting with English tenants, and liberty to take Irish, provided\r\nthey were not proprietors or swordsmen. But the proprietors who had\r\nestablished friendships with their conquerors secretly became tenants\r\nunder them to parts of their former estates, ensuring thereby the\r\nconnivance of their new landlords against their transplantation. On\r\nJune 1, 1655, the commissioners for the affairs of Ireland (Fleetwood,\r\nlord deputy, one of them), being then at Limerick, discovered this\r\nfraud, and issued a peremptory order revoking all former dispensations\r\nfor English proprietors to plant with Irish tenants; and they enjoined\r\nupon the governor of Limerick and all other officers the removing of\r\nthe proprietors thus sheltered and their families into Connaught, on\r\nor before that day three weeks. But, happily, says Mr. Prendergast,\r\nall penal laws against a nation are difficult of execution. The\r\nofficers still connived with many of the poor Irish gentry and\r\nsheltered them, which caused Fleetwood, then commander of the\r\nparliament forces in Ireland, upon his return to Dublin, and within a\r\nfortnight after the prescribed limit for their removal was expired,\r\nto thunder forth from Dublin Castle a severe reprimand to all\r\nofficers thus offending. Their neglect to search for and apprehend\r\nthe transplantable proprietors was denounced as a great dishonour and\r\nbreach of discipline of the army; and their entertaining any of them\r\nas tenants was declared a hindrance to the planting of Ireland with\r\nEnglish Protestants. 'I do therefore,' the order continued, 'hereby\r\norder and declare, that if any officer or soldier under my command\r\nshall offend by neglect of his duty in searching for and apprehending\r\nall such persons as by the declaration of November 30, 1654, are\r\nto transplant themselves into Connaught; or by entertaining them as\r\ntenants on his lands, or as servants under him, he shall be punished\r\nby the articles of war as negligent of his duty, according to the\r\ndemerit of such his neglect.'\r\n\r\nThe English parliament resolved to clear out the population of all\r\nthe principal cities and seaport towns, though nearly all founded and\r\ninhabited by Danes or English, and men of English descent. In order to\r\nraise funds for the war, the following towns were offered to English\r\nmerchants for sale at the prices annexed:--Limerick, with 12,000 acres\r\ncontiguous, for 30,000 l., and a rent of 625 l. payable to the state;\r\nWaterford, with 1,500 acres contiguous, at the same rate; Galway, with\r\n10,000 acres, for 7,500 l., and a rent of 520 l.; Wexford, with 6,000\r\nacres, for 5,000 l., and a rent of 156 l. 4 s.\r\n\r\nThere were no bidders; but still the Government adhered to its\r\ndetermination to clear out the Irish, and supply their place with a\r\nnew English population. Artisans were excepted, but strictly limited\r\nin number, each case being particularly described and registered,\r\nwhile dispensations were granted to certain useful persons, on the\r\npetition of the settlers who needed their services.\r\n\r\nOn July 8 in the same year, the governor of Clonmel was authorised to\r\ngrant dispensations to forty-three persons in a list annexed, or as\r\nmany of them as he should think fit, being artificers and workmen, to\r\nstay for such time as he might judge convenient, the whole time not\r\nto exceed March 25, 1655. On June 5, 1654, the governor of Dublin was\r\nauthorised to grant licences to such inhabitants to continue in the\r\ncity (notwithstanding the declaration for all Irish to quit) as he\r\nshould judge convenient, the licences to contain the name, age,\r\ncolour of hair, countenance, and stature of every such person; and the\r\nlicence not to exceed twenty days, and the cause of their stay to\r\nbe inserted in each licence. Petitions went up from the old native\r\ninhabitants of Limerick; from the fishermen of Limerick; from the\r\nmayor and inhabitants of Cashel, who were all ordered to transplant;\r\nbut, notwithstanding these orders, many of them still clung about\r\nthe towns, sheltered by the English, who found the benefit of their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe deserted cities of course fell speedily into ruins. Lord\r\nInchiquin, president of Munster, put many artisans, menial servants,\r\ngrooms, &c. in the houses, to take care of them in Cork; still about\r\n3,000 good houses in that city, and as many in Youghal, out of which\r\nthe owners had been driven, were destroyed by the soldiers, who used\r\nthe timber for fuel. The council addressed the following letter to\r\nSecretary Thurloe:--\r\n\r\n  'Dublin Castle, March 4, 1656.\r\n\r\n'Right Honourable,--The council, having lately taken into their\r\nmost serious consideration what may be most for the security of this\r\ncountry, and the encouragement of the English to come over and plant\r\nhere, did think fitt that all Popish recusants, as wel proprietors\r\nas others, whose habitations are in any port-towns, walled-towns, or\r\ngarrisons, and who did not before the 15th of September 1643 (being\r\nthe time mentioned in the act of 1653 for the encouragement of\r\nadventurers and soldiers), and ever since profess the Protestant\r\nreligion, should remove themselves and their families out of all such\r\nplaces, and two miles at the least distant therefrom, before the\r\n20th of May next; and being desirous that the English people may take\r\nnotice, that by this means there will be both security and conveniency\r\nof habitation for such as shall be willing to come over as planters,\r\nthey have commanded me to send you the enclosed declaration, and to\r\ndesire you that you will take some course, whereby it may be made\r\nknown unto the people for their encouragement to come over and plant\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n  'Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n  'THOMAS HERBERT, Clerk of the Council.'\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1655, the inhabitants of Galway were commanded to quit the\r\ntown for ever by the 1st of November following, the owners of houses\r\ngetting compensation at eight years' purchase.\r\n\r\n'On October 30, this order was executed. All the inhabitants, except\r\nthe sick and bedrid, were at once banished, to provide accommodation\r\nfor English Protestants, whose integrity to the state should entitle\r\nthem to be trusted in a place of such importance; and Sir Charles\r\nCoote, on November 7, received the thanks of the Government for\r\nclearing the town, with a request that he would remove the sick and\r\nbedrid as soon as the season might permit, and take care that the\r\nhouses while empty were not spoiled by the soldiery. The town was thus\r\nmade ready for the English. There was a large debt of 10,000 l., due\r\nto Liverpool for their loss and suffering for the good cause. The\r\neminent deservings and losses of the city of Gloucester also had\r\ninduced the parliament to order them 10,000 l., to be satisfied in\r\nforfeited lands in Ireland. The commissioners of Ireland now offered\r\nforfeited houses in Galway, rated at ten years' purchase, to the\r\ninhabitants of Liverpool and Gloucester, to satisfy their respective\r\ndebts, and they were both to arrange about the planting of it with\r\nEnglish Protestants. To induce them to accept the proposal, the\r\ncommissioners enlarged upon the advantages of Galway. It lay open for\r\ntrade with Spain, the Straits, the West Indies, and other places;\r\nno town or port in the three nations, London excepted, was more\r\nconsiderable. It had many noble uniform buildings of marble, though\r\nmany of the houses had become ruinous by reason of the war, and the\r\nwaste done by the impoverished English dwelling there. No Irish were\r\npermitted to live in the city, nor within three miles of it. If it\r\nwere only properly inhabited by English, it might have a more hopeful\r\ngain by trade than when it was in the hands of the Irish that\r\nlived there. There never was a better opportunity of undertaking a\r\nplantation and settling manufacturers there than the present, and they\r\nsuggested that it might become another Derry.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cromwellian Settlement.]\r\n\r\nSome writers, sickened with the state of things in Ireland, and\r\nimpatient of the inaction of our rulers, and of the tedious forms of\r\nconstitutional government, have exclaimed: 'Oh for one day of Oliver\r\nCromwell!' Well, Ireland had him and his worthy officers for many\r\nyears. They had opportunities, which never can be hoped for again, of\r\nrooting out the Irish and their religion. '_Thorough_' was their word.\r\nThey dared everything, and shrunk from no consequences. They found\r\nDublin full of Catholics; and on June 19, 1651, Mr. John Hewson had\r\nthe felicity of making the following report on the state of religion\r\nin the Irish metropolis:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. Winter, a godly man, came with the commissioners, and they flock\r\nto hear him with great desire; besides, there is in Dublin, since\r\nJanuary last, about 750 Papists forsaken their priests and the masse,\r\nand attends the public ordinances, I having appointed Mr. Chambers,\r\na minister, to instruct them at his own house once a week. They all\r\nrepaire to him with much affection, and desireth satisfaction. And\r\nthough Dublin hath formerly swarmed with Papists, I know none (now)\r\nthere but one, who is a chirurgeon, and a peaceable man. It is much\r\nhoped the glad tidings of salvation will be acceptable in Ireland, and\r\nthat this savage people may see the salvation of God.'\r\n\r\nPolitical economists tell us that when population is greatly thinned\r\nby war, or pestilence, or famine, Nature hastens to fill up the void\r\nby the extraordinary fecundity of those who remain. The Irish must\r\nhave multiplied very fast in Connaught during the Commonwealth; and\r\nthe mixture of Saxon and Celtic blood resulting from the union of the\r\nCromwellian soldiers with the daughters of the land must have produced\r\na numerous as well as a very vigorous breed in Wexford, Kilkenny,\r\nTipperary, Waterford, Cork, East and West Meath, King's and Queen's\r\nCounties, and Tyrone. But these were not 'wholly a right seed.' This\r\nwas to be found only in the union of English with English, newly\r\narrived from the land of the free. The more precious this seed was,\r\nthe more care there should be in bringing it into the field. This\r\nmatter constituted one of the great difficulties of the plantation.\r\nThere were plenty of Irish midwives: they might have been affectionate\r\nand careful, possibly skilful; but if they had any good quality, the\r\ncouncil could not see it. On the contrary, it gave them credit\r\nfor many bad qualities, the worst of all being their idolatry and\r\ndisloyalty. It was really dreadful to think of English mothers and\r\ntheir infants being at the mercy of Irish nurses. Consequently, after\r\nmuch deliberation, and 'laying the matter before the Lord' in prayer,\r\nit was resolved to bring over a state nurse from England, and to her\r\nspecial care were to be entrusted all the _accouchements_ in the city\r\nof Dublin. Endowed with such a monopoly, it was natural enough that\r\nshe should be an object of envy and dislike to those midwives whom she\r\nhad supplanted. She was therefore annoyed and insulted while passing\r\nthrough the streets. To put a stop to these outrages, a proclamation\r\nwas issued from Dublin Castle for her special protection, which began\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n_By the Commissioners of Parliament for the Affairs of Ireland_.\r\n\r\n'Whereas we are informed by divers persons of repute and godliness,\r\nthat Mrs. Jane Preswick hath, through the blessing of God, been very\r\nsuccessful within Dublin and parts about, through the carefull and\r\nskillfull discharge of her midwife's duty, and instrumental to helpe\r\nsundry poore women who needed her helpe, which bathe abounded to the\r\ncomfourte and preservation of many English women, who (being come\r\ninto a strange country) had otherwise been destitute of due helpe,\r\nand necessitated to expose their lives to the mercy of Irish midwives,\r\nignorant in the profession, and bearing little good will to any of\r\nthe English nation, which being duly considered, we thought fitt to\r\nevidence this our acceptance thereof, and willingness that a person\r\nso eminently qualified for publique good and so well reported of\r\nfor piety and knowledge in her art should receive encouragement and\r\nprotection,' &c.\r\n\r\nCromwell and his ministers did not hesitate about applying heroic\r\nremedies for what they conceived to be grievances. The Irish\r\nparliament was abolished, like the Irish churches, the Irish cities,\r\nand everything else that could be called Irish, except the thing for\r\nwhich they fought--_the land_, which was to be Irish no more. The new\r\nEngland which the Protector established in the Island of Saints\r\nwas represented, like Scotland, in the united parliament at\r\nWestminster--which first assembled in 1657. In that parliament, Major\r\nMorgan represented the county of Wicklow. In speaking against some\r\nproposed taxation for Ireland, he said, among other things, the\r\ncountry was under very heavy charges for rewards paid for the\r\ndestruction of three beasts--the wolf, the priest, and the tory. 'We\r\nhave three beasts to destroy,' he said, 'that lay burdens upon us. The\r\nfirst is a wolf, on whom we lay 5 l. a head if a dog, and 10 l. if a\r\nbitch. The second beast is a priest, on whose head we lay 10 l.; if he\r\nbe eminent, more. The third beast is a tory, on whose head, if he be\r\na public tory, we lay 20 l.; and 40 s. on a private tory. Your army\r\ncannot catch them: the Irish bring them in; brothers and cousins cut\r\none another's throats.'\r\n\r\nIn May, 1653, the council issued the following printed declaration.\r\n'Upon serious consideration had of the great multitudes of poore\r\nswarming in all parts of this nacion, occasioned by the devastation\r\nof the country, and by the habits of licentiousness and idleness\r\nwhich the generality of the people have acquired in the time of this\r\nrebellion; insomuch that frequently some are found feeding on carrion\r\nand weeds,--some starved in the highways, and many times poor children\r\nwho have lost their parents, or have been deserted by them, are found\r\nexposed to and some of them fed upon _by ravening wolves and other\r\nbeasts and birds of prey._'\r\n\r\nNo wonder the wolves multiplied and became very bold, when they fed\r\nupon such dainty fare as Irish children! By what infatuation, by what\r\ndiabolical fanaticism were those rulers persuaded that they were\r\ndoing God a service, or discharging the functions of a Government,\r\nin carrying out such a policy, and consigning human beings to such a\r\nfate!\r\n\r\nBy a printed declaration of June 29, 1653, published July 1, 1656,[1]\r\nthe commanders of the various districts were to appoint days and times\r\nfor hunting the wolf; and persons destroying wolves and bringing their\r\nheads to the commissioners of the revenue of the precinct were to\r\nreceive for the head of a bitch wolf, 6 _l_; of a dog wolf, 5 _l_; for\r\nthe head of every cub that preyed by himself, 40 s.; and for the head\r\nof every sucking cub, 10 _s_: The assessments on several counties\r\nto reimburse the treasury for these advances became, as appears from\r\nMajor Morgan's speech, a serious charge. In corroboration it appears\r\nthat in March, 1655, there was due from the precinct of Galway 243\r\nl. 5 s. 4 d. for rewards paid on this account. But the most curious\r\nevidence of their numbers is that lands lying only nine miles north of\r\nDublin were leased by the state in the year 1653, under conditions of\r\nkeeping a hunting establishment with a pack of wolf hounds for killing\r\nthe wolves, part of the rent to be discounted in wolves' heads, at\r\nthe rate in the declaration of June 29, 1653. Under this lease Captain\r\nEdward Piers was to have all the state lands in the barony of Dunboyne\r\nin the county of Meath, valued at 543 l. 8 s. 8 d., at a rent greater\r\nby 100 l. a year than they then yielded in rent and contribution, for\r\nfive years from May 1 following, on the terms of maintaining at Dublin\r\nand Dunboyne three wolf-dogs, two English mastiffs, a pack of hounds\r\nof sixteen couple (three whereof to hunt the wolf only), a knowing\r\nhuntsman, and two men and one boy. Captain Piers was to bring to the\r\ncommissioners of revenue at Dublin a stipulated number of wolf-heads\r\nin the first year and a diminishing number every year; but for every\r\nwolf-head whereby he fell short of the stipulated number, 5 l. was to\r\nbe defalked from his salary.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A/84, p.255. Republished 7th July, 1656.--'Book of\r\nPrinted Declarations of the Commissioners for the Affairs of Ireland.'\r\nBritish Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Cromwellian Settlement, p.154.]\r\n\r\nTwenty pounds was paid for the discovery of a priest, the second\r\n'burdensome beast,' and to harbour him was death. Again I avail myself\r\nof the researches of Mr. Prendergast, to give a few orders on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n'_August_ 4, 1654.--Ordered, on the petition of Roger Begs, priest,\r\nnow prisoner in Dublin, setting forth his miserable condition by being\r\nnine months in prison, and desiring liberty to go among his friends\r\ninto the country for some relief; that he be released upon giving\r\nsufficient security that within four months he do transport himself to\r\nforeign parts, beyond the seas, never to return, and that during that\r\ntime he do not exercise any part of his priestly functions, nor move\r\nfrom where he shall choose to reside my above five miles, without\r\npermission. Ordered, same date, on the petition of William Shiel,\r\npriest, that the said William Shiel being old, lame, and weak, and\r\nnot able to travel without crutches, he be permitted to reside in\r\nConnaught where the Governor of Athlone shall see fitting, provided,\r\nhowever, he do not remove one mile beyond the appointed place without\r\nlicence, nor use his priestly function.'\r\n\r\nAt first the place of transportation was Spain. Thus:--'_February_\r\n1, 1653. Ordered that the Governor of Dublin take effectual course\r\nwhereby the priests now in the several prisons of Dublin be forthwith\r\nshipped with the party going for Spain; and that they be delivered\r\nto the officers on shipboard for that purpose: care to be taken that,\r\nunder the colour of exportation, they be not permitted to go into the\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\n'_May_ 29, 1654.--Upon reading the petition of the Popish priests\r\nnow in the jails of Dublin; ordered, that the Governor of Dublin take\r\nsecurity of such persons as shall undertake the transportation of\r\nthem, that they shall with the first opportunity be shipped for some\r\nparts in amity with the Commonwealth, provided the five pounds for\r\neach of the said priests due to the persons that took them, pursuant\r\nto the tenor of a declaration dated January 6, 1653, be first paid or\r\nsecured.'\r\n\r\nThe commissioners give reasons for this policy, which are identical\r\nwith what we hear constantly repeated at the present day in Ireland\r\nand England and in most of the newspapers conducted by Protestants.\r\nFor two centuries the burden of all comments on Irish affairs is 'the\r\ncountry would be happy but for priests and agitators.' 'Hang or banish\r\nthe priests!' cry some very amiable and respectable persons, 'and then\r\nwe shall have peace.' 'We can make nothing of those priests,' says the\r\nimproving landlord, or agent, 'they will not look us straight in the\r\nface.'\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 1655, in a letter from the commissioners to the\r\nGovernor of Barbadoes, advising him of the approach of a ship with a\r\ncargo of proprietors deprived of their lands, and then seized for not\r\ntransplanting, or banished for having no visible means of support,\r\nthey add that amongst them were three priests; and the commissioners\r\nparticularly desire they may be so employed as they may not return\r\nagain where that sort of people are able to do much mischief, having\r\nso great an influence over the Popish Irish, and alienating their\r\naffections from the present Government. 'Yet these penalties did not\r\ndaunt them, or prevent their recourse to Ireland. In consequence of\r\nthe great increase of priests towards the close of the year 1655, a\r\ngeneral arrest by the justices of the peace was ordered, under which,\r\nin April, 1656, the prisons in every part of Ireland seem to have\r\nbeen filled to overflowing. On May 3, the governors of the respective\r\nprecincts were ordered to send them with sufficient guards from\r\ngarrison to garrison to Carrickfergus, to be there put on board such\r\nship as should sail with the first opportunity for the Barbadoes. One\r\nmay imagine the pains of this toilsome journey by the petition of one\r\nof them. Paul Cashin, an aged priest, apprehended at Maryborough,\r\nand sent to Philipstown on the way to Carrickfergus, there fell\r\ndesperately sick, and, being also extremely aged, was in danger of\r\nperishing in restraint for want of friends and means of relief. On\r\nAugust 27, 1656, the commissioners, having ascertained the truth of\r\nhis petition, ordered him sixpence a day during his sickness; and\r\n(in answer probably to this poor prisoner's prayer to be spared from\r\ntransportation) their order directed that it should be continued to\r\nhim in his travel thence (after his recovery) to Carrickfergus, in\r\norder to his transportation to the Barbadoes.'\r\n\r\nAt Carrickfergus the horrors of approaching exile seem to have shaken\r\nthe firmness of some of them; for on September 23, 1656, Colonel\r\nCooper, who had the charge of the prison, reporting that several would\r\nunder their hands renounce the Pope's supremacy, and frequent the\r\nProtestant meetings and no other, he was directed to dispense with the\r\ntransportation, if they could give good Protestant security for the\r\nsincerity of their professions.\r\n\r\nAs for the third beast--the tory, the following extract gives an idea\r\nof the class to which he belonged, or, rather, from which he sprang.\r\n\r\n'And whereas the children, grandchildren, brothers, nephews, uncles,\r\nand next pretended heirs of the persons attainted, do remain in\r\nthe provinces of Leinster, Ulster, and Munster, having little or no\r\nvisible estates or subsistence, but living only and coshering upon\r\nthe common sort of people who were tenants to or followers of the\r\nrespective ancestors of such persons, waiting an opportunity, as\r\nmay justly be supposed, to massacre and destroy the English who, as\r\nadventurers or souldiers, or their tenants, are set down to plant upon\r\nthe several lands and estates of the persons so attainted,' they\r\nare to transplant or be transported to the English plantations in\r\nAmerica.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Act for Attainder of the Rebels in Ireland, passed 1656.\r\nScobell's 'Acts and Ordinances.']\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Mr. Prendergast exclaims:--\r\n\r\n'But how must the feelings of national hatred have been heightened,\r\nby seeing every where crowds of such unfortunates, their brothers,\r\ncousins, kinsmen, and by beholding the whole country given up a prey\r\nto hungry insolent soldiers and adventurers from England, mocking\r\ntheir wrongs, and triumphing in their own irresistible power!'\r\n\r\nEvery possible mode of repression that has been devised at the\r\npresent time as a remedy for Ribbonism was then tried with unflinching\r\ndetermination. John Symonds, an English settler, was murdered near\r\nthe garrison town of Timolin, in the county Kildare. All the Irish\r\ninhabitants of the town and neighbourhood were immediately transported\r\nto Connaught as a punishment for the crime. A few months after two\r\nmore settlers were murdered at Lackagh.\r\n\r\n'All the Irish in the townland of Lackagh were seized; four of them\r\nby sentence of court-martial were hanged for the murder, or for not\r\npreventing it; and all the rest, thirty-seven in number, including two\r\npriests, were on November 27 delivered to the captain of the \"Wexford\"\r\nfrigate, to take to Waterford, there to be handed over to Mr. Norton,\r\na Bristol merchant, to be sold as bond slaves to the sugar-planters in\r\nthe Barbadoes. Among these were Mrs. Margery Fitzgerald, of the age\r\nof fourscore years, and her husband, Mr. Henry Fitzgerald of Lackagh;\r\nalthough (as it afterwards appeared) the tories had by their frequent\r\nrobberies much infested that gentleman and his tenants--discovery that\r\nseems to have been made only after the king's restoration.'\r\n\r\nThe penalties against the tories themselves were to allow them no\r\nquarter when caught, and to set a price upon their heads. The ordinary\r\nprice for the head of a tory was 40 s.; for leaders of tories, or\r\ndistinguished men, it varied from 5 l. to 30 l.\r\n\r\n'But,' continues Mr. Prendergast, 'a more effective way of suppressing\r\ntories seems to have been to induce them, as already mentioned,\r\nto betray or murder one another--a measure continued after the\r\nRestoration, during the absence of parliaments, by acts and orders\r\nof state, and re-enacted by the first parliament summoned after\r\nthe Revolution, when in that and the following reigns almost every\r\nprovision of the rule of the parliament of England in Ireland was\r\nre-enacted by the parliaments of Ireland, composed of the soldiers and\r\nadventurers of Cromwell's day, or new English and Scotch capitalists.\r\nIn 1695 any tory killing two other tories proclaimed and on their\r\nkeeping was entitled to pardon--a measure which put such distrust and\r\nalarm among their bands on finding one of their number so killed,\r\nthat it became difficult to kill a second. Therefore, in 1718, it was\r\ndeclared sufficient qualification for pardon for a tory to kill one\r\nof his fellow-tories. This law was continued in 1755 for twenty-one\r\nyears, and only expired in 1776. Tory-hunting and tory-murdering thus\r\nbecame common pursuits. No wonder, therefore, after so lengthened an\r\nexistence, to find traces of the tories in our household words. Few,\r\nhowever, are now aware that the well-known Irish nursery rhymes have\r\nso truly historical a foundation:--\r\n\r\n  'Ho! brother Teig, what is your story?'\r\n  'I went to the wood and shot a tory:'\r\n  'I went to the wood, and shot another;'\r\n  'Was it the same, or was it his brother?'\r\n\r\n  'I hunted him in, and I hunted him out,\r\n  Three times through the bog, and about and about;\r\n  Till out of a bush I spied his head,\r\n  So I levelled my gun and shot him dead.'\r\n\r\nAfter the war of 1688, the tories received fresh accessions, and, a\r\ngreat part of the kingdom being left waste and desolate, they betook\r\nthemselves to these wilds, and greatly discouraged the replanting of\r\nthe kingdom by their frequent murders of the new Scotch and English\r\nplanters; the Irish 'choosing rather' (so runs the language of\r\nthe act) 'to suffer strangers to be robbed and despoiled, than to\r\napprehend or convict the offenders.' In order, therefore, for the\r\nbetter encouragement of strangers to plant and inhabit the kingdom,\r\nany persons presented as tories, by the gentlemen of a county, and\r\nproclaimed as such by the lord lieutenant, might be shot as outlaws\r\nand traitors; and any persons harbouring them were to be guilty of\r\nhigh treason.[1] Rewards were offered for the taking or killing of\r\nthem; and the inhabitants of the barony, of the ancient native race,\r\nwere to make satisfaction for all robberies and spoils. If persons\r\nwere maimed or dismembered by tories, they were to be compensated by\r\n10 l.; and the families of persons murdered were to receive 30 l.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cromwellian Settlement, p.163, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe Restoration at length brought relief and enlargement to the\r\nimprisoned Irish nation. They rushed across the Shannon to see their\r\nold homes; they returned to the desolated cities, full of hope\r\nthat the king for whom they had suffered so much would reward\r\ntheir loyalty, by giving them back their inheritances--the 'just\r\nsatisfaction' promised at Breda to those who had been unfairly\r\ndeprived of their estates. The Ulster Presbyterians also counted on\r\nhis gratitude for their devotion to his cause, notwithstanding the\r\nwrongs inflicted on them by Strafford and the bishops in the name of\r\nhis father. But they were equally doomed to disappointment. Coote\r\nand Broghill reigned in Dublin Castle as lords justices. The first\r\nparliament assembled in Dublin for twenty years, contained an\r\noverwhelming majority of undertakers, adventurers, and Puritan\r\nrepresentatives of boroughs, from which all the Catholic electors\r\nhad been excluded. 'The Protestant interest,' a phrase of tremendous\r\npotency in the subsequent history of Ireland, counted 198 members\r\nagainst 64 Catholics in the Commons, and in the Lords 72 against 21\r\npeers. A court was established under an act of parliament in Dublin,\r\nto try the claims of 'nocent' and 'innocent' proprietors. The judges,\r\nwho were Englishmen, declared in their first session that 168 were\r\ninnocent to 19 nocent. The Protestant interest was alarmed; and,\r\nthrough the influence of Ormond, then lord lieutenant, the duration of\r\nthe court was limited, and when it was compelled to close its labours,\r\nonly 800 out of 3,000 cases had been decided. If the proportions\r\nof nocent and innocent were the same, an immense number of innocent\r\npersons were deprived of their property. In 1675, fifteen years after\r\nthe Restoration, the English settlers were in possession of 4,500,000\r\nacres, while the old owners retained 2,250,000 acres. By an act passed\r\nin 1665, it was declared that no Papist, who had not already been\r\nadjudged innocent, should ever be entitled to claim any lands or\r\nsettlements.'\r\n\r\nAny movement on the part of the Roman Catholics during this reign,\r\nand indeed, ever since, always raised an alarm of the 'Protestant\r\ninterest' in danger. While the panic lasted the Catholics were\r\nsubjected to cruel restrictions and privations. Thus Ormond, by\r\nproclamation, prohibited Catholics from entering the castle of Dublin,\r\nor any other fortress; from holding fairs or markets within the walls\r\nof fortified towns, and from carrying arms to such places. By another\r\nproclamation, he ordered all the _relatives_ of known 'tories' to be\r\narrested and banished the kingdom, within fourteen days, unless such\r\ntories were killed or surrendered within that time. There was one tory\r\nfor whose arrest all ordinary means failed. This was the celebrated\r\nRedmond O'Hanlon, still one of the most popular heroes with the Irish\r\npeasantry. He was known on the continent as Count O'Hanlon, and was\r\nthe brother of the owner of Tandragee, now the pretty Irish seat of\r\nthe Duke of Manchester. As no one would betray this outlaw, who levied\r\nheavy contributions from the settlers in Ulster, it was alleged\r\nand believed that the viceroy hired a relative to shoot him. 'Count\r\nO'Hanlon,' says Mr. D. Magee, 'a gentleman of ancient lineage, as\r\naccomplished as Orrery, or Ossory, was indeed an outlaw to the code\r\nthen in force; but the stain of his cowardly assassination must for\r\never blot the princely escutcheon of James, Duke of Ormond.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See 'The Tory War of Ulster,' by John P. Prendergast,\r\nauthor of 'The Cromwellian Settlement.' This pamphlet abounds in the\r\nmost curious information, collected from judicial records, descriptive\r\nof Ireland from the Restoration to the Revolution--A.D. 1660-1690.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PENAL CODE, A NEW SYSTEM OF LAND-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accession of James II. was well calculated to have an intoxicating\r\neffect on the Irish race. He was a Catholic, he undertook to effect\r\na counter-reformation. He would restore the national hierarchy to the\r\nposition from which it had been dragged down and trampled under the\r\nfeet of the Cromwellians. He would give back to the Irish gentry and\r\nnobility their estates; and to effect this glorious revolution, he\r\nrelied upon the faith and valour of the Irish. The Protestant militia\r\nwere disarmed, a Catholic army was formed; the corporations were\r\nthrown open to Catholics. Dublin and other corporations, which refused\r\nto surrender their exclusive charters, were summarily deprived of\r\ntheir privileges; Catholic mayors and sheriffs, escorted by troops,\r\nwent in state to their places of worship. The Protestant chancellor\r\nwas dismissed to make way for a Catholic, Baron Rice. The plate\r\nof Trinity College was seized as public property. The Protestants,\r\nthoroughly alarmed by these arbitrary proceedings, fled to England in\r\nthousands. Many went to Holland and joined the army of the Prince of\r\nOrange. Dreadful stories were circulated of an intended invasion of\r\nEngland by wild Irish regiments under Tyrconnel. There was a rumour of\r\nanother massacre of the English, and of the proposed repeal of the\r\nact of settlement. Protestants who could not cross the channel fled to\r\nEnniskillen and to Derry, which closed its gates and prepared for its\r\nmemorable siege. James, who had fled to France, plucked up courage\r\nto go to Ireland, and make a stand there in defence of his crown.\r\nHis progress from Kinsale to Dublin was an ovation. Fifteen royal\r\nchaplains scattered blessings around him; Gaelic songs and dances\r\namused him; he was flattered in Latin orations, and conducted to his\r\ncapital under triumphal arches. In Dublin the trades turned out with\r\nnew banners; two harpers played at the gate by which he entered; the\r\nclergy in their robes chanted as they went: and forty young girls,\r\ndressed in white, danced the ancient _rinka_, scattering flowers on\r\nthe newly sanded streets. Tyrconnell, now a duke, the judges, the\r\nmayor and the corporation, completed the procession, which moved\r\nbeneath arches of evergreens, and windows hung with 'tapestry and\r\ncloth of arras.' The recorder delivered to his majesty the keys of the\r\ncity, and the Catholic primate, Dominick Maguire, waited in his robes\r\nto conduct him to the royal chapel, where the _Te Deum_ was sung. On\r\nthat day the green flag floated from the main tower of the castle,\r\nbearing the motto, 'Now or never--now and for ever.'\r\n\r\nThe followers of James, according to Grattan, 'though papists, were\r\nnot slaves. They wrung a constitution from King James before they\r\naccompanied him to the field.' A constitution wrung from such a man\r\nwas not worth much. His parliament passed an act for establishing\r\nliberty of conscience, and ordering every man to pay tithes to his own\r\nclergy only, with some other measures of relief. But he began to\r\nplay the despot very soon. The Commons voted him the large subsidy of\r\n20,000 l. He doubled the amount by his own mere motion. He established\r\na bank, and by his own authority decreed a bank monopoly. He debased\r\nthe coinage, and fixed the prices of merchandise by his own will.\r\nHe appointed a provost and librarian in Trinity College without the\r\nconsent of the senate, and attempted to force fellows and scholars on\r\nthe university contrary to the statutes. The events which followed\r\nare well known to all readers of English history. Our concern is with\r\ntheir effects on the land question.\r\n\r\nOne of the measures passed by this parliament was an act repealing the\r\nact of settlement. But, soon after the Revolution, measures were taken\r\nto render that settlement firmer than ever. A commission was appointed\r\nto enquire into the forfeited estates; and the consequence was that\r\n1,060,792 acres were declared escheated to the crown. In 1695 King\r\nWilliam, in his speech, read to the Irish parliament, assured\r\nthem that he was intent upon the firm settlement of Ireland upon a\r\nProtestant basis. He kept his word, for when he died there did not\r\nremain in the hands of Catholics one-sixth of the land which their\r\ngrandfathers held, even after the passing of the act of settlement.\r\nThe acts passed for securing the Protestant interest formed the series\r\nknown as the penal code, which was in force for the whole of the\r\neighteenth century. It answered its purpose effectually; it reduced\r\nthe nation to a state of poverty, degradation, and slavishness of\r\nspirit unparalleled in the history of Christendom, while it made the\r\nsmall dominant class a prodigy of political and religious tyranny.\r\nNever was an aristocracy, as a body, more hardened in selfishness,\r\nmore insolent in spirit; never was a church more negligent of duty,\r\nmore intensely and ostentatiously secular. Both church and state\r\nreeked with corruption.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted for degrading the Catholics, and reducing all to one\r\nplebeian level, was most ingenious. The ingenuity indeed may be said\r\nto be Satanic, for it debased its victims morally as well as socially\r\nand physically. It worked by means of treachery, covetousness,\r\nperfidy, and the perversion of all natural affections. The trail of\r\nthe serpent was over the whole system. For example, when the last Duke\r\nof Ormond arrived as lord lieutenant in 1703, the Commons waited on\r\nhim with a bill 'for discouraging the further growth of Popery,' which\r\nbecame law, having met his decided approval. This act provided that\r\nif the son of a Catholic became a Protestant, the father should be\r\nincapable of selling or mortgaging his estate, or disposing of any\r\nportion of it by will. If a child ever so young professed to be a\r\nProtestant, it was to be taken from its parents, and placed under the\r\nguardianship of the nearest Protestant relation.\r\n\r\nThe sixth clause renders Papists incapable of purchasing any manors,\r\ntenements, hereditaments, or any rents or profits arising out of the\r\nsame, or of holding any lease of lives, or other lease whatever, for\r\nany term exceeding thirty-one years. And with respect even to such\r\nlimited leases, it further enacts, that if a Papist should hold a farm\r\nproducing a profit greater than _one-third of the amount of the rent_,\r\nhis right to such should immediately cease, and pass over entirely\r\nto the first Protestant who should discover the rate of profit. The\r\nseventh clause prohibits Papists from succeeding to the properties or\r\nestates of their Protestant relations. By the tenth clause, the estate\r\nof a Papist, not having a Protestant heir, is ordered to be gavelled,\r\nor divided in equal shares between _all_ his children. The sixteenth\r\nand twenty-fourth clauses impose the oath of abjuration, and the\r\nsacramental test, as a qualification for office, and for voting at\r\nelections. The twenty-third clause deprives the Catholics of Limerick\r\nand Galway of the protection secured to them by the articles of the\r\ntreaty of Limerick. The twenty-fifth clause vests in the crown all\r\nadvowsons possessed by Papists.\r\n\r\nA further act was passed, in 1709, imposing additional penalties. The\r\nfirst clause declares that no Papist shall be capable of holding an\r\nannuity for life. The third provides, that the child of a Papist, on\r\nconforming, shall at once receive an annuity from his father; and that\r\nthe chancellor shall compel the father to discover, upon oath, the\r\nfull value of his estate, real and personal, and thereupon make an\r\norder for the support of such conforming child or children, and for\r\nsecuring such a share of the property, after the father's death, as\r\nthe court shall think fit. The fourteenth and fifteenth clauses secure\r\njointures to Popish wives who shall conform. The sixteenth prohibits\r\na Papist from teaching, even as assistant to a Protestant master. The\r\neighteenth gives a salary of 30 l. per annum to Popish priests who\r\nshall conform. The twentieth provides rewards for the discovery of\r\nPopish prelates, priests, and teachers, according to the\r\nfollowing whimsical scale:--For discovering an archbishop, bishop,\r\nvicar-general, or other person, exercising any foreign ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction, 50 l.; for discovering each regular clergyman, and each\r\nsecular clergyman, not registered, 20 l.; and for discovering each\r\nPopish schoolmaster or usher, 10 l.\r\n\r\nIn judging the Irish peasantry, we should try to estimate the effects\r\nof such a system on any people for more than a century. It will\r\naccount for the farmer's habit of concealing his prosperity, and\r\nkeeping up the appearance of poverty, even if he had not reason for it\r\nin the felonious spirit of appropriation still subsisting under legal\r\nsanction. We are too apt to place to the account of race or religion\r\nthe results of malignant or blundering legislation. We are not without\r\nexamples of such results in England itself.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1831-2, a very startling state of things was\r\npresented. In a period of great general prosperity, that portion of\r\nEngland in which the poor laws had their most extensive operation, and\r\nin which by much the largest expenditure of poor-rates had been made,\r\nwas the scene of daily riot and nightly incendiarism. There were\r\nninety-three parishes in four counties, of which the population was\r\n113,147, and the poor-law expenditure 81,978 l., or 14 s. 5 d. per\r\nhead; and there were eighty parishes in three other counties, the\r\npopulation of which was 105,728, and the poor-law expenditure 30,820\r\nl., or 5 s. 9 d. a head. In the counties in which the poor-law\r\nexpenditure was large, the industry and skill of the labourers were\r\npassing away, the connection between the master and servant had become\r\nprecarious, the unmarried were defrauded of their fair earnings,\r\nand riots and incendiarism prevailed. In the counties where the\r\nexpenditure was comparatively small, there was scarcely any instance\r\nof disorder; mutual attachment existed between the workman and his\r\nemployer; the intelligence, skill, and good conduct of the labourers\r\nwere unimpaired, or increased. This striking social contrast was only\r\na specimen of what prevailed throughout large districts, and generally\r\nthroughout the south and north of England, and it proved that, either\r\nthrough the inherent vice of the system, or gross mal-administration\r\nin the southern counties, the poor-law had the most demoralising\r\neffect upon the working classes, while it was rapidly eating up the\r\ncapital upon which the employment of labour depended. This fact was\r\nplaced beyond question by a commission of enquiry, which was composed\r\nof individuals distinguished by their interest in the subject, and\r\ntheir intimate knowledge of its principles and details. Its labours\r\nwere continued incessantly for two years. Witnesses most competent to\r\ngive information were summoned from different parts of the country.\r\nThe commissioners had before them documentary evidence of every kind\r\ncalculated to throw light on the subject. They personally visited\r\nlocalities, and examined the actual operation of the system on the\r\nspot; and when they could not go themselves, they called to their aid\r\nassistant commissioners, some of whom extended their enquiries into\r\nScotland, Guernsey, France, and Flanders; while they also collected a\r\nvast mass of interesting evidence from our ambassadors and diplomatic\r\nagents in different countries of Europe and America. It was upon the\r\nreport of this commission of enquiry that the act was founded for the\r\namendment and better administration of the laws relating to the poor\r\nin England and Wales (4 and 5 William IV., cap. 76). A more solid\r\nfoundation for a legislative enactment could scarcely be found. The\r\nimportance of the subject fully warranted all the expense and labour\r\nby which it was obtained.\r\n\r\nOne of the most astounding facts established by the enquiry was the\r\nwide-spread demoralisation which had developed itself in certain\r\ndistricts. Home had lost its sanctity. The ties that bind parents and\r\nchildren were loosened, and natural affection gave place to intense\r\nselfishness, which often manifested itself in the most brutal manner.\r\nWorkmen grew lazy and dishonest. Young women lost the virtue which is\r\nnot only the point of honour with their sex, but the chief support of\r\nall other virtues. Not only women of the working classes, but in some\r\ncases even substantial farmers' daughters, and sometimes those who\r\nwere themselves the actual owners of property, had their illegitimate\r\nchildren as charges on the parish, regularly deducting the cost\r\nof their maintenance from their poor-rate, neither they nor their\r\nrelatives feeling that to do so was any disgrace. The system must\r\nhave been fearfully vicious that produced such depravation of moral\r\nfeeling, and such a shocking want of self-respect.\r\n\r\nDr. Burn has given a graphic sketch of the duties of an overseer\r\nunder the old poor-law system in England. 'His office is to keep an\r\nextraordinary watch to prevent people from coming to inhabit without\r\ncertificates; to fly to the justices to remove them. Not to let anyone\r\nhave a farm of 10 l. a year. To warn the parishioners, if they would\r\nhave servants, to hire them by the month, the week, or the day, rather\r\nthan by any way that can give them a settlement; or if they do hire\r\nthem for a year, then to endeavour to pick a quarrel with them before\r\nthe year's end, and so to get rid of them. To maintain their poor as\r\ncheaply as they possibly can, and not to lay out twopence in prospect\r\nof any future good, but only to serve the present necessity. To\r\nbargain with some sturdy person to take them by the lump, who yet is\r\nnot intended to take them, but to hang over them _in terrorem_, if\r\nthey shall complain to the justices for want of maintenance. To\r\nsend them out into the country a begging. To bind out poor children\r\napprentices, no matter to whom, or to what trade; but to take special\r\ncare that the master live in another parish. To move heaven and earth\r\nif any dispute happen about a settlement; and, in that particular,\r\nto invert the general rule, and stick at no expense. To pull down\r\ncottages: _to drive out as many inhabitants, and admit as few, as they\r\npossibly can; that is, to depopulate the parish, in order to lessen\r\nthe poor's-rate_. To be generous, indeed, sometimes, in giving a\r\nportion with the mother of a bastard child to the reputed father,\r\non condition that he will marry her, or with a poor widow, _always\r\nprovided that the husband_ be settled elsewhere; or if a poor man with\r\na large family happen to be industrious, they will charitably assist\r\nhim in taking a farm in some neighbouring parish, and give him 10 l.\r\nto pay his first year's rent with, that they may thus for ever get rid\r\nof him and his progeny.'\r\n\r\nThe effect of this system was actually to depopulate many parishes.\r\nThe author of a pamphlet on the subject, Mr. Alcock, stated that the\r\ngentlemen were led by this system to adopt all sorts of expedients\r\nto hinder the poor from marrying, to discharge servants in their\r\nlast quarter, to evict small tenants, and pull down cottages; so\r\nthat several parishes were in a manner depopulated, while England\r\ncomplained of a want of useful hands for agriculture, manufactories,\r\nfor the land and sea service. 'When the minister marries a couple,' he\r\nsaid, 'he rightly prays that they may be fruitful in the procreation\r\nof children; but most of the parishioners pray for the very contrary,\r\nand perhaps complain of him for marrying persons, that, should they\r\nhave a family of children, might likewise become chargeable.' Arthur\r\nYoung also described the operation of the law in his time, in\r\nclearing off the people, and causing universally 'an open war against\r\ncottages.' Gentlemen bought them up whenever they had an opportunity,\r\nand immediately levelled them with the ground, lest they should become\r\n'nests of beggars' brats.' The removal of a cottage often drove the\r\nindustrious labourer from a parish where he could earn 15 s. a week,\r\nto one where he could earn but 10 s. As many as thirty or forty\r\nfamilies were sent off by removals in one day. Thus, as among the\r\nScotch labourers of the present day, marriage was discouraged; the\r\npeasantry were cleared off the land, and increasing immorality was the\r\nnecessary consequence.\r\n\r\nThere was another change in the old system, by which the interests of\r\nthe influential classes were made to run in favour of the 'beggars'\r\nnests,' which were soon at a premium. The labourer was to be paid,\r\nnot for the value of his labour, but according to the number of his\r\nfamily; the prices of provisions being fixed by authority, and the\r\nguardians making up the difference between what the wages would buy\r\nand what the family required.\r\n\r\nThe allowance scales issued from time to time were framed on the\r\nprinciple that every labourer should have a gallon loaf of standard\r\nwheaten bread weekly for every member of his family, and one over. The\r\neffect of this was, that a man with six children, who got 9 s. a week\r\nwages, required nine gallon loaves, or 13 s. 6 d. a week, so that he\r\nhad a pension of 4 s. 6 d. over his wages. Another man, with a wife\r\nand five children, so idle and disorderly that no one would employ\r\nhim, was entitled to eight gallon loaves for their maintenance, so\r\nthat he had 12 s. a week to support him. The increase of allowance\r\naccording to the number of children acted as a direct bounty upon\r\nmarriage. The report of the Committee of the House of Commons on\r\nlabourers' wages, printed in 1824, describes the effect of this\r\nallowance system in paralysing the industry of the poor. 'It is\r\nobvious,' remarked the committee, 'that a disinclination to work must\r\nbe the consequence of so vicious a system. He whose subsistence\r\nis secure without work, and who cannot obtain more than a mere\r\nsufficiency by the hardest work, will naturally be an idle and\r\ncareless labourer. Frequently the work done by four or five such\r\nlabourers does not amount to what might easily be performed by a\r\nsingle labourer at task work. A surplus population is encouraged: men\r\nwho receive but a small pittance know that they have only to marry and\r\nthat pittance will be increased proportionally to the number of their\r\nchildren. When complaining of their allowance, they frequently say,\r\n\"We will marry, and then you must maintain us.\" This system secures\r\nsubsistence to all; to the idle as well as the industrious; to the\r\nprofligate as well as the sober; and, as far as human interests are\r\nconcerned, all inducements to obtain a good character are taken away.\r\nThe effects have corresponded with the cause: able-bodied men\r\nare found slovenly at their work, and dissolute in their hours of\r\nrelaxation; a father is negligent of his children, the children do not\r\nthink it necessary to contribute to the support of their parents;\r\nthe employer and employed are engaged in personal quarrels; and the\r\npauper, always relieved, is always discontented. Crime advances with\r\nincreasing boldness; and the parts of the country where this system\r\nprevails are, in spite of our gaols and our laws, filled with poachers\r\nand thieves.' Mr. Hodges, chairman of the West Kent quarter sessions,\r\nin his evidence before the emigration committee, said, 'Formerly,\r\nworking people usually stayed in service till they were twenty-five,\r\nthirty, and thirty-five years of age, before they married; whereas\r\nthey now married frequently under age. Formerly, these persons\r\nhad saved 40 l. and 50 l. before they married, and they were never\r\nburdensome to the parish; now, they have not saved a shilling before\r\ntheir marriage, and become immediately burdensome.'\r\n\r\nThe farmers were not so discontented with this allowance system as\r\nmight be supposed, because a great part of the burden was cast upon\r\nother shoulders. The tax was laid indiscrimately upon all fixed\r\nproperty; so that the occupiers of villas, shopkeepers, merchants, and\r\nothers who did not employ labourers, had to pay a portion of the wages\r\nfor those that did. The farmers were in this way led to encourage a\r\nsystem which fraudently imposed a heavy burden upon others, and which,\r\nby degrading the labourers, and multiplying their numbers beyond the\r\nreal demand for them, must, if allowed to run its full course, have\r\nultimately overspread the whole country with the most abject poverty\r\nand wretchedness.\r\n\r\nThere was another interest created which tended to increase the evil.\r\nIn the counties of Suffolk, Sussex, Kent, and generally through\r\nall the south of England, relief was given in the shape of house\r\naccommodation, or free dwellings for the poor. The parish officers\r\nwere in the habit of paying the rent of the cottages; the rent was\r\ntherefore high and sure, and consequently persons who had small pieces\r\nof ground were induced to cover them with those buildings. On this\r\nsubject Mr. Hodges, the gentleman already referred to, remarks: 'I\r\ncannot forbear urging again that any measure having for its object the\r\nrelief of the parishes from their over population, must of necessity\r\nbecome perfectly useless, unless the act of parliament contains some\r\nregulations with respect to the erecting and maintaining of cottages.\r\nI am quite satisfied that the erecting of cottages has been a most\r\nserious evil throughout the country. The getting of the cottage tempts\r\nyoung people of seventeen and eighteen years of age, and even younger,\r\nto marry. It is notorious that almost numberless cottages have been\r\nbuilt by persons speculating on the parish rates for their rents.'\r\n\r\nThe evils of this system had reached their height in the years 1831-2.\r\nThat was a time when the public mind was bent upon reforms of all\r\nsorts, without waiting for the admission from the Tories that the\r\ngrievances of which the nation complained were 'proved abuses.' The\r\nreformers were determined no longer to tolerate the state of things,\r\nin which the discontent of the labouring classes was proportioned to\r\nthe money disbursed in poor-rates, or in voluntary charities; in\r\nwhich the young were trained in idleness, ignorance, and vice--the\r\nable-bodied maintained in sluggish and sensual indolence--the aged\r\nand more respectable exposed to all the misery incident to dwelling\r\nin such society as that of a large workhouse without discipline or\r\nclassification--the whole body of inmates subsisting on food far\r\nexceeding both in kind and amount, not merely the diet of the\r\nindependent labourer, but that of the majority of the persons who\r\ncontributed to their support. The farmer paid 10 s. in the pound in\r\npoor-rates, and was in addition compelled to employ supernumerary\r\nlabourers not required on his farm, at a cost of from 100 l. to 250 l.\r\na year; the labourer had no need to hasten himself to seek work, or to\r\nplease his master, or to put a restraint upon his temper, having all\r\nthe slave's security for support, without the slave's liability to\r\npunishment. The parish paid parents for nursing their little children,\r\nand children for supporting their aged parents, thereby destroying\r\nin both parties all feelings of natural affection and all sense of\r\nChristian duty.\r\n\r\nI hope I shall be excused in giving, from a former work of my own,\r\nthese home illustrations to prove that bad laws can degrade and\r\ndemoralize a people in a comparatively short time, in spite of race\r\nand creed and public opinion; and that, where class interests are\r\ninvolved, the most sacred rights of humanity are trampled in the mire\r\nof corruption. Even now the pauperism resulting of necessity from the\r\nlarge-farm system is degrading the English people, and threatening to\r\nrot away the foundations of society. On this subject I am glad to find\r\na complete corroboration of my own conclusions in a work by one of the\r\nablest and most enlightened Christian ministers in England, the Rev.\r\nDr. Rigg. He says:--\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding a basis of manly, honest, and often generous\r\nqualities, the common character of all the uneducated and unelevated\r\nclasses of the English labouring population includes, as marked\r\nand obvious features, improvidence, distrust of their superiors,\r\ndiscontent at their social position, and a predominant passion for\r\ngross animal gratification. Of this general character we regard the\r\nrude, heavy, unhopeful English peasant, who knows no indulgence\r\nor relaxation but that of the ale-house, and lives equally without\r\ncontent and without ambition, as affording the fundamental\r\ntype, which, like all other things English, possesses a marked\r\nindividuality. It differs decidedly from the Irish type of peasant\r\ndegradation. Something of this may be due to the effect of race. The\r\nKelt and the Saxon may be expected to differ. Yet we think but little\r\nstress is to be laid upon this. There is, probably, much more Keltic\r\nblood in the southern and western counties of England, and, also, more\r\nSaxon blood in some of the southern and even western parts of\r\nIreland, than has been generally supposed. We apprehend that a Saxon\r\npopulation, under the same conditions as the southern and western\r\nIrish peasantry, would have grown up into very much the same sort of\r\npeople as the Irish have been; while a Keltic population, exposed to\r\nthe same influences, through successive generations, as the midland\r\nand southern peasantry of England, would not have been essentially\r\ndifferent at the present day from the actual cultivators of the soil.\r\n\r\n'The Irish peasant is poorer and yet more reckless than the\r\nEnglishman; but he is not so sullen or so spiritless. His body is not\r\nso muscular or so strongly-set as that of the Anglo-Saxon husbandman,\r\non whose frame the hard and unintermitted toil of thirty generations\r\nhas stamped its unmistakable impress, and, correspondently, he is a\r\nless persevering and less vigorous labourer; but, as a general rule,\r\nhis stature is taller and his step far more free and elastic than that\r\nof the sturdy but slow and stunted labourer of our southern counties.\r\nThere are wild mountainous districts of the west, indeed, in which\r\nthe lowest type of the Irish peasantry is found, that must be taken\r\nas exceptions to our general statement; and as many from those regions\r\ncross the Channel to tramp through England in the complex character\r\nof mendicant labourers, no doubt some have received from them an\r\nimpression as to the Irish peasantry very different from what our\r\nobservations are intended to convey. But no one can have travelled\r\nthrough the south of Ireland without having noticed what we state. The\r\nTipperary and Kilkenny peasantry are proverbially tall; Connemara has\r\nbeen famed for its \"giants,\" and many of both sexes throughout the\r\nsouth, are, spite of their rags, fine figures, and graceful in their\r\nmovements. While looking at them, we have ceased to wonder at what has\r\nbeen regarded as no better than the arch-agitator's blarney, when he\r\nspoke of the Irish as the \"finest pisantry in the world;\" and we have\r\neven felt saddened as we mentally contrasted with what we saw before\r\nus the bearing and appearance of our own southern labourers. For\r\nthe tattered Irish peasant, living in a mud hovel, is, after all, a\r\ngentleman in his bearing; whereas there is generally either a cringing\r\nservility or a sullen doggedness in the demeanour of the south\r\nSaxon labourer. The Irishman is, besides, far more intelligent and\r\nready-witted than the Saxon husbandman. The fact is that the Irishman,\r\nif underfed, has not been overworked. His life has not been one of\r\nunceasing and oppressive labour. Nor has his condition been one\r\nof perpetual servitude. With all his poverty, he has been, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, his own master. Half-starved, or satisfying his\r\nappetite on light and innutritious fare,--far worse housed and\r\nclad than the poorest English labourer, often, indeed, almost\r\nhalf-naked,--oppressed by middle-men, exactors of rack-rent; with\r\nall this the Irish cottier has been, from father to son, and\r\nfrom generation to generation, _a tenant, and not merely a day\r\nlabourer_.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'Essays for the Times, on Ecclesiastical and Social\r\nSubjects,' by James H. Rigg, D.D. London, 1866.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nULSTER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us, then, endeavour to get rid of the pernicious delusions about\r\nrace and religion in dealing with this Irish land question. Identity\r\nof race and substantial agreement in religion did not prevent the\r\nUlster landlords from uprooting their tenants when they fancied it was\r\ntheir interest to banish them--to substitute grazing for tillage, and\r\ncattle for a most industrious and orderly peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Primate Boulter contain much valuable information on\r\nthe state of Ulster in the last century, and furnish apt illustrations\r\nof the land question, which, I fancy, will be new and startling to\r\nmany readers. Boulter was lord primate of Ireland from 1724 to 1738.\r\nHe was thirteen times one of the lords justices. As an Englishman and\r\na good churchman, he took care of the English interests and of the\r\nestablishment. The letters were written in confidence to Sir Robert\r\nWalpole and other ministers of state, and were evidently not intended\r\nfor publication. An address 'to the reader' from some friend, states\r\ntruly that they give among other things an impartial account of 'the\r\ndistressed state of the kingdom for want of _tillage_, the vast sums\r\nof money sent out of the nation for corn, flour, &c., the dismal\r\ncalamities thereon, the want of trade and the regulation of the\r\nEnglish and other coins, to the very great distress of all the\r\nmanufacturers,' &c. They show that he was a man of sound judgment,\r\npublic-spirited, and very moderate and impartial for the times in\r\nwhich he lived. His evidence with regard to the relations of landlord\r\nand tenant in Ulster is exceedingly valuable at the present moment.\r\nLord Dufferin could not have read the letters when he wrote his book;\r\notherwise I should think his apology for the landlords of the last\r\ncentury would have been considerably modified.\r\n\r\nPrimate Boulter repeatedly complained to Walpole, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, and other ministers, that the Ulster farmers were deserting\r\nthe country in large numbers, emigrating to the United States, then\r\nBritish colonies, to the West Indies, or to any country where they\r\nhoped to get the means of living, in many cases binding themselves\r\nto work for a number of years _as slaves_ in payment of their passage\r\nout. The desire to quit the country of their birth is described by the\r\nprimate as a mania. Writing to the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1728 he\r\nsays:--'We are under great trouble here about a frenzy that has taken\r\nhold of very great numbers to leave this country for the West Indies,\r\nand we are endeavouring to learn what may be the reasons of it, and\r\nthe proper remedies.' Two or three weeks later he reported to the Duke\r\nof Newcastle that for several years past some agents from the colonies\r\nin America, and several masters of ships, had gone about the country\r\n'and deluded the people with stories of great plenty and estates to\r\nbe had for going for in those parts of the world.' During the previous\r\nsummer more than 3,000 men, women, and children had been shipped\r\nfor the West Indies. Of these, not more than one in ten were men of\r\nsubstance. The rest hired themselves for their passage, or contracted\r\nwith masters of ships for four years' servitude, 'selling themselves\r\nas servants for their subsistence.' The whole north was in a ferment,\r\npeople every day engaging one another to go next year to the West\r\nIndies. 'The humour,' says the primate, 'has spread like a contagious\r\ndistemper, and the people will hardly hear anybody that tries to\r\ncure them of their madness. The worst is that it affects only\r\n_Protestants_, and reigns chiefly in the North, which is the seat of\r\nour linen manufacture.'\r\n\r\nAs the Protestant people, the descendants of the English and Scotch\r\nwho had settled in the country in the full assurance that they were\r\nbuilding homes for their posterity, were thus deserting those homes in\r\nsuch multitudes, their pastors sent a memorial to the lord lieutenant,\r\nsetting forth the grievances which they believed to be the cause of\r\nthe desertion. On this memorial the primate wrote comments to the\r\nEnglish Government, and, in doing so, he stated some astounding\r\nfacts as to the treatment of the people by their landlords. He was a\r\ncautious man, thoroughly acquainted with the facts, and writing under\r\na sense of great responsibility. In order to understand some of those\r\nfacts, we should bear in mind that the landlords had laid down large\r\nportions of their estates in pasture, to avoid the payment of tithes,\r\nand that this burden was thrown entirely upon the tenants who tilled\r\nthe land. Now, let my readers mark what the primate states as to their\r\ncondition. He says:--'If a landlord takes too great a portion of the\r\nprofits of a farm for his share by way of rent (as the tithe will\r\nlight on the tenant's share), the tenant will be impoverished; but\r\nthen it is not the tithe, but the increased rent that undoes the\r\nfarmer. And, indeed, in this country, where I fear the tenant hardly\r\never has more than one-third of the profits he makes of his farm for\r\nhis share, and too often but a _fourth_, or, perhaps, a _fifth part_,\r\nas the tenant's share is charged with the tithe, his case is, no\r\ndoubt, hard, but it is plain from what side the hardship arises.' What\r\nthe gentlemen wanted to be at, according to the primate, was, that\r\nthey might go on raising their rents, and that the clergy should\r\nreceive their old payments. He admits, however, that the tenants were\r\nsometimes cited to the ecclesiastical courts, and if they failed to\r\nappear there, they stood excommunicated; and he adds, 'possibly when a\r\nwrit _de excommunicato capiendo_ is taken out, and they find they have\r\n7 l. or 8 l. to pay, _they run away_, for the greatest part of the\r\noccupiers of the land here are so poor, that an extraordinary stroke\r\nof 8 l. or 10 l. falling on them is certain ruin to them.' He further\r\nstates that, to his own knowledge, many of the clergy had chosen\r\nrather to lose their 'small dues' than to be at a certain great\r\nexpense in getting them, 'and at an uncertainty whether the farmer\r\nwould not at last _run away without paying anything_.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the Protestants of Ulster during the era of\r\nthe penal code; and it is a curious fact that it was the Presbyterians\r\nand not the Catholics that were forced by the exactions of the\r\nProtestant landlords and the clergy to run away from the country which\r\ntheir forefathers had been brought over to civilize. But there was\r\nanother fact connected with the condition of Ulster which I dare say\r\nwill be almost incredible to many readers. The tenantry, so cruelly\r\nrack-rented and impoverished, were reduced by two or three bad seasons\r\nto a state bordering upon famine. There was little or no corn in the\r\nprovince. The primate set on foot a subscription in Dublin, to which\r\nhe himself contributed very liberally. The object was to buy food to\r\nsupply the necessities of the north, and to put a stop to 'the great\r\ndesertion' they had been threatened with. He hoped that the landlords\r\nwould 'do _their_ part by remitting some arrears, or making some\r\nabatement of their rents.' As many of the tenants had eaten the oats\r\nthey should have sowed their lands with, he expected the landlords\r\nwould have the good sense to furnish them with seed; if not, a great\r\ndeal of land would lie waste that year. And where were the provisions\r\ngot? Partly in Munster, where corn was very cheap and abundant. But\r\nthe people of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Clonmel objected to have\r\ntheir provisions sent away, although they were in some places 'as\r\ncheap again as in the north; but where dearest, at least one-third\r\npart cheaper.' Riotous mobs broke open the store-houses and cellars,\r\nsetting what price they pleased upon the provisions. And, what between\r\nthose riots and the prevalence of easterly winds, three weeks elapsed\r\nbefore the 3,000 l. worth of oats, oatmeal, and potatoes could be got\r\ndown to relieve the famishing people of the north, which then seemed\r\nblack enough, even to its own inhabitants. Hence the humane primate\r\nwas obliged to write: 'The humour of going to America still continues,\r\nand the scarcity of provisions certainly makes many quit us. There\r\nare now seven ships at Belfast that are carrying off 1,000 passengers\r\nthither, and if we knew how to stop them, as most of them can neither\r\nget victuals nor work at home, it would be cruel to do it.'\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian clergy suffered greatly from the impoverishment of\r\ntheir people. Several of them who had been receiving a stipend of\r\n50 l. a year, had their incomes reduced to less than 15 l. In their\r\ndistress they appealed to the primate, and, staunch churchman as he\r\nwas, they found in him a kind and earnest advocate. Writing to Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, on March 31, 1729, he pleaded for the restoration of\r\n400 l. a year, which had been given to the non-conforming clergy\r\nof Ireland from the privy purse, in addition to the 1,200 l. royal\r\nbounty, which, it appears, had been suspended for two years, owing\r\nto the death of the late king. 'They are sensible,' said his grace,\r\n'there is nothing due to them, nor do they make any such claim; but as\r\nthe calamities of this kingdom are at present very great, and by the\r\ndesertion of many of their people to America, and the poverty of the\r\ngreatest part of the rest, their contributions, particularly in the\r\nnorth, are very much fallen off, it would be a great instance of his\r\nmajesty's goodness if he would consider their present distress.' In\r\nour own days a Presbyterian minister would be considered to deserve\r\nwell of his country if he emigrated to America, and took with him as\r\nmany of the people as he could induce to forsake their native land.\r\nBut what was the great plea which Primate Boulter urged on the English\r\nMinister on behalf of the Presbyterian clergy of his day? It was, that\r\nthey had exerted their influence to prevent emigration. 'It is,'\r\nhe said, 'but doing them justice to affirm that they are very\r\nwell affected to his majesty and his royal family, and by the best\r\nenquiries I could make, do their best endeavours to keep their\r\ncongregations from deserting the country, not more than one or two\r\nof the younger ministers having anyways encouraged the humour now\r\nprevailing here. And his majesty's goodness in giving them some\r\nextraordinary relief on this occasion of their present great distress\r\nwould undoubtedly make them _more active to retain their people here_.\r\nI cannot help mentioning on this occasion that, what with scarceness\r\nof corn in the north, _and the loss of all credit there_, and by\r\nthe numbers that go, or talk of going, to America, and with the\r\ndisturbances in the south, this kingdom is at present in a deplorable\r\ncondition.'\r\n\r\nIn a statement previously made to the Bishop of London, the Irish\r\nprimate earnestly solicited his correspondent to use his influence\r\nto prevent the Irish landlords from passing a law to strip the\r\nestablished clergy of their rights with respect to the tithe of\r\nagistment. They had entered into a general combination, and formed a\r\nstock purse to resist the payment of tithe, except by the poor\r\ntenants who tilled the soil, a remarkable contrast to the zeal of\r\nthe landlords of our own time in defending church property against\r\n'spoliation' by the imperial legislature, and to the liberality with\r\nwhich many of them are now contributing to the Sustentation Fund.\r\nHow shall we account for the change? Is it that the landlords of the\r\npresent day are more righteous than their grandfathers? Or is it that\r\nthe same principle of self-interest which led the proprietors of past\r\ntimes to grind the tenantry and rob the Church, now operates in forms\r\nmore consistent with piety and humanity, and by its subtle influence\r\nillustrates the maxim of the poet--\r\n\r\n  Self-love and social is the same.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the primate contented himself in this letter\r\nwith a defence of the Church, in which he admitted matters of real\r\ngrievance, merely alluding to other grievances, 'such as raising\r\nthe rents unreasonably, the oppression by justices of the peace,\r\nseneschals, and other officers in the country.'\r\n\r\nFrom the pictures of the times he presents we should not be surprised\r\nat his statement to the Duke of Newcastle, that the people who went\r\nto America made great complaints of the oppressions they suffered, and\r\nsaid that those oppressions were one reason of their going. When he\r\nwent on his visitation, in 1726, he 'met all the roads full of whole\r\nfamilies that had left their homes to beg abroad,' having consumed\r\ntheir stock of potatoes two months before the usual time. During the\r\nprevious year many hundreds had perished of famine. What was the cause\r\nof this misery, this desolating process going on over the plains of\r\nUlster? The archbishop accounts for it by stating that many persons\r\nhad let large tracts of land, from 3,000 to 4,000 acres, which were\r\nstocked with cattle, and had no other inhabitants on their land than\r\nso many cottiers as were necessary to look after their sheep and black\r\ncattle, '_so that, in some of the finest counties, in many places\r\nthere is neither house nor cornfield to be seen in ten or fifteen\r\nmiles' travelling_, and daily in some counties many gentlemen, as\r\ntheir leases fall into their hands, tie up their tenants from tillage;\r\nand this is one of the main causes why so many venture to go into\r\nforeign service at the hazard of their lives if taken, because they\r\ncannot get land to till at home.'\r\n\r\nMy readers should remember that the industrious, law-abiding,\r\nbible-loving, God-fearing people, who were thus driven by oppression\r\nfrom the fair fields of Ulster, which they had cultivated, and\r\nthe dwellings which they had erected, to make way for sheep and\r\ncattle--because it was supposed by the landlords that sheep and cattle\r\npaid better--were the descendants of British settlers who came to the\r\ncountry under a royal guarantee _of freeholds and permanent tenures_.\r\nLet them picture to their minds this fine race of honest, godly\r\npeople, rack-rented, crushed, evicted, heart-broken--men, women, and\r\nchildren--Protestants, Saxons, cast out to perish as the refuse of the\r\nearth, by a set of landed proprietors of their own race and creed; and\r\nlearn from this most instructive fact that, if any body of men has\r\nthe power of making laws to promote its own interest, no instincts of\r\nhumanity, no dictates of religion, no restraints of conscience can\r\nbe relied upon to keep them from acting with ruthless barbarity,\r\nand doing more to ruin their country than a foreign invader could\r\naccomplish by letting loose upon it his brutal soldiers. How much\r\nmore earnestly would Boulter have pleaded with the prime minister of\r\nEngland on behalf of the wretched people of Ulster if he could have\r\nforeseen that ere long those Presbyterian emigrants, with the sense\r\nof injustice and cruel wrong burning in their hearts, would be found\r\nfighting under the banner of American independence--the bravest and\r\nfiercest soldiers of freedom which the British troops encountered in\r\nthe American war. History is continually repeating itself, yet how\r\nvainly are its lessons taught! The same legal power of extermination\r\nis still possessed by the Irish landlords after sixty-nine years of\r\nimperial legislation. Our hardy, industrious people, naturally as well\r\ndisposed to royalty as any people in the world, are still crowding\r\nemigrant ships in all our ports, deserting their country with the same\r\nbitter feelings that animated the Ulster men a century ago, hating our\r\nGovernment with a mortal hatred, and ready to fight against it under\r\na foreign flag! We have no Primate Boulter now in the Protestant\r\nhierarchy to plead the cause of an unprotected tenantry; but we have\r\nthe press, which can concentrate upon the subject the irresistible\r\nforce of public opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a churchman, Primate Boulter naturally regarded the land question\r\nin its bearings on the interests of the Establishment. Writing to Sir\r\nRobert Walpole in 1737 he said that he had in vain represented to the\r\nlandlords that, by destroying the tithe of agistment, they naturally\r\ndiscouraged tillage, lessened the number of people, and raised the\r\nprice of provisions. By running into cattle they caused the young men\r\nto enlist in foreign service for bread, there being no employment for\r\nthem at home, 'where two or three hands can look after some hundreds\r\nof acres stocked with cattle.' And by this means, said the primate, 'a\r\ngreat part of our churches are neglected; in many places five, six, or\r\nseven parishes bestowed on one incumbent, who, perhaps, with all\r\nhis tithes, scarce gets 100 l. a year.' But there was at that time a\r\nmember of the Irish House of Commons who was capable of taking a more\r\nenlarged view of the Irish question. This was Mr. Arthur Dobbs, who\r\nbelonged to an old and honourable Ulster family--the author of a book\r\non the 'North-west Passage to India,' and of a very valuable work on\r\nthe 'Trade of Great Britain and Ireland.' He was intimately acquainted\r\nwith the working of the Irish land system, for he had been many years\r\nagent of the Hertfort estate, one of the largest in Ireland. There\r\nis among Boulter's letters an introduction of Mr. Dobbs to Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, recommending him as a person of good sense, who had applied\r\nhimself to the improvement of trade, and to the making of our colonies\r\nin America of more advantage than they had hitherto been. He was\r\nafterwards made Governor of North Carolina. I have mentioned these\r\nfacts in the hope of securing the attention of landlords and statesmen\r\nto the following passage from his book accounting for the deplorable\r\ncondition of the province of Ulster at that time, and the emigration\r\nof its industrious and wealth-producing inhabitants. In my humble\r\nopinion it furnishes irresistible arguments in favour of a measure\r\nwhich should settle the Irish land question in such a manner that it\r\nwould speak to the people of Ireland in the words of holy writ:\r\n'And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant\r\nvineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another\r\ninhabit; they shall not plant and another eat.' Mr. Dobbs says:--\r\n\r\n'How can a tenant improve his land when he is convinced that, after\r\nall his care and toil, his improvements will be overrated, and he\r\nwill be obliged to shift for himself? Let us place ourselves in his\r\nsituation and see if we should think it reasonable to improve for\r\nanother, if those improvements would be the very cause of our being\r\nremoved from the enjoyment of them. I believe we should not. Industry\r\nand improvements go very heavily on when we think we are not to have\r\nthe property in either. What can be expected, then, from covenants to\r\nimprove and plant, when the person to do it knows he is to have _no\r\nproperty in them_? There will be no concern or care taken to preserve\r\nthem, and they will run to ruin as fast as made or planted. What was\r\nit induced so many of the commonalty lately to go to America but high\r\nrents, bad seasons, and want of good tenures, or a permanent property\r\nin their land? This kept them poor and low, and they scarce had\r\nsufficient credit to procure necessaries to subsist or till their\r\nground. They never had anything to store, all was from hand to mouth;\r\nso one or two bad crops broke them. Others found their stock dwindling\r\nand decaying visibly, and so removed before all was gone, while they\r\nhad as much left as would pay their passage, and had little more than\r\nwhat would carry them to the American shore.\r\n\r\n'This, it may be allowed, was the occasion of the poor farmers going\r\nwho had their rents lately raised. But it may be objected that was not\r\nthe reason why rich farmers went, and those who had several years in\r\nbeneficial leases still unexpired, who sold their bargains and removed\r\nwith their effects. But it is plain they all went for the same reason;\r\nfor these last, from _daily examples before them_, saw the present\r\noccupiers dispossessed of their lands at the expiration of their\r\nleases, and no preference given to them; so they expected it would\r\nsoon be their own case, to avoid which, and make the most of the years\r\nstill unexpired, they sold, and carried their assets with them to\r\nprocure a settlement in a country where they had reason to expect a\r\npermanent property.'\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that sentiments very similar were published by\r\none of Cromwell's officers about a century before. The plea which\r\nhe put forth for the Irish tenant in the dedication of his work on\r\nIreland to the Protector, has been repeated ever since by the tenants,\r\nbut repeated in vain: Captain Bligh, the officer alluded to, said:\r\n'The first prejudice is, that if a tenant be at ever so great pains or\r\ncost for the improvement of his land, he doth thereby but occasion a\r\ngreater rack-rent upon himself, or else invests his landlord with his\r\ncost and labour _gratis_, or at least lies at his landlord's mercy for\r\nrequital; which occasions a neglect of all good husbandry, to his own,\r\nthe land, the landlord, and the commonwealth's suffering.' Now, this,\r\nI humbly conceive, might be removed, if there were a law enacted, by\r\nwhich every landlord should be obliged either to give him reasonable\r\nallowance for his clear improvement, or else suffer him _or his_\r\nto enjoy it so much longer or till he hath had a proportionable\r\nrequital.'\r\n\r\nBut although Primate Boulter protested against the conduct of the\r\nlandlords--all Episcopalians--who were ruining the church as well as\r\nthe country, the established clergy, as a body, were always on the\r\nside of the oppressors.\r\n\r\nThe Test Act placed the Presbyterians, like the Papists, in the\r\nposition of an inferior race. 'In the city of Londonderry alone, which\r\nPresbyterian valour had defended, ten out of twelve aldermen,\r\nand twenty out of twenty-four burgesses, were thrust out of the\r\ncorporation by that act, which placed an odious mark of infamy upon\r\nat least one-half the inhabitants of the kingdom.' Presbyterians could\r\nnot legally keep a common school. The _Edinburgh Review_ says: 'All\r\nthe settlements, from first to last, had the effect of making the\r\ncause of the church and the cause of the landlords really one. During\r\nthe worst days of landlord oppression it never identified itself with\r\nthe interests of the people, but uniformly sustained the power and\r\nprivileges of the landlords.'\r\n\r\nIt was vain to expect justice from the Irish parliament. The people\r\nof Ireland never were governed exclusively, or at all, by her own\r\nSovereign, her own Lords, and her own Commons. Ireland was 'in the\r\ncustody of England,' just as much before the Union as during the last\r\nsixty-seven years. Even during the few brief years of her spasmodic\r\n'independence,' the mass of the nation formed no part of the 'Commons\r\nof Ireland.' It was still, as it always had been, a sham parliament--a\r\nbody representing the colonial aristocracy--acting as undertakers for\r\nthe Government of England, for whose interest exclusively this island\r\nwas to be ruled. Provided this result was secured, it did not matter\r\nmuch, at the other side of the Channel, how the Irish people were\r\ntreated. Indeed, they were not recognised as the people of Ireland,\r\nor any part thereof. Even philosophic liberals, like Lord Charlemont,\r\nwere shocked at the idea of a Papist getting into the Irish House\r\nof Commons; and the volunteer system was shattered by this insane\r\nanimosity of the ruling race against the subject nation. The antipathy\r\nwas as strong as the antipathy between the whites and the negroes in\r\nthe West Indies and the United States. Hence the remorseless spirit in\r\nwhich atrocities were perpetrated in 1798. Mr. Daunt has shown that a\r\nlarge proportion of the Irish House of Lords consisted of men who were\r\nEnglish to all intents and purposes--many of them by birth, and many\r\nby residence, and, no doubt, they always came over with reluctance to\r\nwhat Lord Chancellor Clare called 'our damnable country.' It may be\r\nthat in some years after the abolition of the Establishment--after\r\nsome experience of the _régime_ of religious equality--the two races\r\nin this island will learn to act together so harmoniously as to give a\r\nfair promise that they could be safely trusted with self-legislation.\r\nBut the '_self_' must be one body animated by one spirit; not\r\ntwo bodies, chained together, irritated by the contact, fiercely\r\nstruggling against one another, eternally reproaching one another\r\nabout the mutual wrongs of the past, and not unfrequently coming\r\nto blows, like implacable duellists shut up in a small room, each\r\ndetermined to kill or be killed. If England were to let go her hold\r\neven now, something like this would be the Irish 'situation.' The\r\nabiding force of this antipathy, in the full light of Christianity, is\r\nawful.\r\n\r\nIn his 'Life, Letters, and Speeches of Lord Plunket,' the Hon.\r\nDavid Plunket states that, when his grandfather entered the Irish\r\nparliament, 'the English Government had nearly abandoned the _sham_\r\nof treating the Irish parliament as an independent legislature; the\r\ntreasury benches were filled with placemen and pensioners. All efforts\r\ntending to reform of parliament or concession to the Catholics had\r\nbeen given up as useless. Grattan and some of his immediate followers\r\nhad seceded from an assembly too degraded to appreciate their motives,\r\nor to be influenced by their example; and whatever remained of\r\nindependence in the House of Commons ministers still laboured to bring\r\nunder their control. Scarcely thirty votes appeared in opposition\r\non the most important divisions, while Government could at any time\r\nreadily whip a majority of 100.'\r\n\r\nAccording to a Government return made in 1784, by Pitt's direction,\r\n116 nomination seats were divided between some 25 proprietors. Lord\r\nShannon returned no less than 16 members, and the great family of\r\nPonsonby returned 14; Lord Hillsborough, 9, the Duke of Leinster,\r\n7, and the Castle itself 12. Eighty-six seats were _let out_ by the\r\nowners, in consideration of titles, offices, and pensions. No less\r\nthan 44 seats were occupied by placemen, 32 by gentlemen who had\r\npromises of pensions, 12 by gentlemen who stood out for higher prices\r\nfrom Government. The regular opposition appears to have been limited\r\nto 82 votes, of which 30 belonged to Whig nominees, and the rest to\r\nthe popular party.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, easy to account for the state of public feeling which Mr.\r\nPlunket, with these facts and figures before him, so well describes.\r\nHe says truly that if it were possible to appeal to the country under\r\nthese circumstances, the people would not have responded. 'Gloomy\r\nand desperate, they had lost all confidence in their parliament,\r\nand looked to other quarters for deliverance from the _intolerable\r\ntyranny_ under which they suffered. There can be no doubt that\r\nthis anarchy and disgrace were in a great degree the result of a\r\nmisgovernment, ancient and recent, _which seems to have been always\r\nadopted with a view to bring out strongly the worst elements of the\r\nIrish character_; but it was at that time said, and no doubt believed\r\nby the Opposition, that the ministry of the day had deliberately\r\nplanned and accomplished the disorganisation of the Irish people and\r\ntheir parliament, in order to enable them to carry out their favourite\r\nproject of the Union.'\r\n\r\nMr. Plunket, after describing the classes of 'representatives' that\r\nhis grandfather had to deal with in the Irish House of Commons,\r\nfurther says: 'It is true that this corrupt assembly cannot fairly be\r\nlooked upon as the mirror of national character and national honour.\r\nThe members of the majority who voted for the Union _were not_\r\nthe representatives of the people, _but the hired servants of the\r\nMinister, for the Parliament had been packed for the purpose_.'\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the century, however, the French Revolution,\r\nthe American war, and the volunteer movement, had begun to cause\r\nsome faint stirring of national life in the inert mass of the Roman\r\nCatholic population, which the penal code had '_dis-boned_.' Up\r\nto this time they were not even thought of in the calculations of\r\npoliticians. According to Dean Swift, Papists counted no more in\r\npolitics than the women and children. Macaulay uses a still more\r\ncontemptuous comparison to express the estimate in which they were\r\nheld in those times, saying, that their lords and masters would as\r\nsoon have consulted their poultry and swine on any political question.\r\nNevertheless, during the excitement of the volunteer movement, some\r\nof the poor Celts began to raise their heads, and presumed to put the\r\nquestion to the most liberal portion of the ruling race--'Are we not\r\nmen? Have not we also some rights?' The appeal was responded to in the\r\nIrish parliament, and in 1793 the elective franchise was conceded to\r\nRoman Catholics. It was the first concession, and the least that could\r\nbe granted. But the bare proposal excited the utmost indignation in\r\nthe Tory party, and especially in the Dublin corporation, where\r\nthe Orange spirit was rampant. That body adopted an address to the\r\nProtestants of Ireland, which bears a remarkable resemblance in its\r\nspirit and style to addresses lately issued by Protestant Defence\r\nAssociations. Both speak in the kindest terms of their Roman Catholic\r\nfellow-subjects, disclaim all intention of depriving them of any\r\nadvantages they enjoy under our glorious constitution, declaring that\r\ntheir objects are purely _defensive_, and that they want merely to\r\nguard that constitution against the aggressions of the Papacy quite as\r\nmuch for the sake of Roman Catholics as for the sake of Protestants.\r\n'Countrymen and friends,' said the Dublin Tories, seventy-five years\r\nago, 'the firm and manly support which we received from you when we\r\nstood forward in defence of the Protestant Ascendancy, deserves our\r\nwarmest thanks. We hoped that the sense of the Protestants of Ireland,\r\ndeclared upon that occasion, would have convinced our Roman Catholic\r\nfellow-subjects that the pursuit of political power was for them a\r\nvain pursuit; for, though the liberal and enlightened mind of the\r\nProtestant receives pleasure at seeing the Catholic exercise his\r\nreligion with freedom, enjoy his property in security, and possess\r\nthe highest degree of personal liberty, yet, experience has taught us\r\nthat, without the ruin of the Protestant establishment, the Catholic\r\ncannot be allowed the smallest influence in the state.'\r\n\r\nThose men were as thoroughly convinced as their descendants,\r\nwho protest against concession to-day, that all our Protestant\r\ninstitutions would go to perdition, if Papists, although then mere\r\nserfs, were allowed to vote for members of parliament. They were\r\nequally puzzled to know why Roman Catholics were discontented, or what\r\nmore their masters could reasonably do for them to add to the enviable\r\nhappiness of their lot. 'We entreat you,' the Dublin corporation said\r\nto their Protestant brethren throughout the country--'we entreat you\r\nto join with us in using every honest means of persuading the Roman\r\nCatholics to rest content with the most perfect toleration of their\r\nreligion, the fullest security of their property, and the most\r\ncomplete personal liberty; but, by no means, now or hereafter, to\r\nattempt any interference in the government of the kingdom, as such\r\ninterference would be incompatible with the Protestant Ascendancy,\r\nwhich we have resolved with our lives and fortunes to maintain.'\r\nLest any doubt should exist as to what they meant by 'Protestant\r\nAscendancy,' they expressly defined it. They resolved that it\r\nconsisted in a Protestant King of Ireland; a Protestant Parliament,\r\nProtestant electors and Government; Protestant benches of justice;\r\na Protestant hierarchy; the army and the revenue, through all their\r\nbranches and details, Protestant; and this system supported by a\r\nconnection with the Protestant realm of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe power of the political franchise to elevate a degraded people, to\r\nconvert slaves into men, is exhibited before the eyes of the present\r\ngeneration in the Southern States of America; even where differences\r\nof race and colour are most marked, and where the strongest natural\r\nantipathies are to be overcome. We may judge from this what must\r\nhave been the effect of this concession on the Irish Celts. The\r\nforty-shilling freeholders very soon became objects of consideration\r\nwith their landlords, who were anxious to extend their political\r\ninfluence in their respective counties, for the representation of\r\nwhich the great proprietors had many a fierce contest. The abolition\r\nof this franchise by the Emancipation Act made that measure a\r\ngrievance instead of a relief to the peasantry, for the landlords were\r\nnow as anxious to get rid of the small holders as they had been to\r\nincrease them so long as they served their political purpose. It was\r\none of the great drawbacks which deprived emancipation of the healing\r\neffect it would otherwise have produced. If--as Pitt intended--that\r\nmeasure had formed part of the Union arrangements; if the\r\nforty-shilling freeholders had been spared, and the priesthood had\r\nbeen endowed, we should never have had an agitation for repeal or even\r\nfor the separation of the church from the state. Pitt's plan of the\r\nUnion included the abolition of Protestant Ascendancy.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, in one of his letters on Ireland, said: 'A word has\r\nbeen lately struck in the mint of the castle of Dublin. Thence it was\r\nconveyed to the Tholsel, or city hall, where having passed the touch\r\nof the corporation, so respectably stamped and vouched, it soon became\r\ncurrent in parliament, and was carried back by the speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons, in great pomp, as an offering of homage from whence\r\nit came. That word is Ascendancy. The word is not absolutely new.' He\r\nthen gives its various meanings, and first shows what it does _not_\r\nsignify in the new sense. Not influence obtained by love or reverence,\r\nor by superior management and dexterity; not an authority derived from\r\nwisdom or virtue, promoting the happiness and freedom of the Roman\r\nCatholic people; not by flattering them, or by a skilful adaptation to\r\ntheir humours and passions. It means nothing of all these. Burke then\r\nshows what it does mean. 'New ascendancy is old mastership. It is\r\nneither more nor less than the resolution of one sect of people in\r\nIreland to consider themselves the sole citizens in the commonwealth,\r\nand to keep a dominion over the rest, by reducing them to absolute\r\nslavery under a military power; and thus fortified in their power, to\r\ndivide the public estate, which is the result of general contribution,\r\nas a military booty, solely among themselves. This ascendancy,\r\nby being a _Protestant_ ascendancy, does not better it, from a\r\ncombination of a note or two more in this anti-harmonic scale. By\r\nthe use that is frequently made of the term, and the policy that is\r\ngrafted on it, the name Protestant becomes nothing more or better than\r\nthe name of a persecuting faction, with a relation of some sort of\r\ntheological hostility to others, but without any sort of ascertained\r\ntenets of its own, upon the ground of which it persecutes other men;\r\nfor the patrons of this Protestant ascendancy neither do nor can,\r\nby anything positive, define or describe what they mean by the word\r\nProtestant.... The whole is nothing but pure and perfect malice. It\r\nis indeed a perfection in that kind, belonging to beings of a higher\r\norder than man, and to them we ought to leave it.... Let three\r\nmillions of people but abandon all that they and their ancestors have\r\nbeen taught to believe sacred, and to forswear it publicly in terms\r\nthe most degrading, and nothing more is required of them.... The word\r\n_Protestant_ is the charm that locks up in a dungeon of servitude\r\nthree millions of people.\r\n\r\nEvery thoughtful reader of the debates in parliament on the state of\r\nIreland, must have been struck with the difference of opinion between\r\nthe Liberals and the Conservatives, as to the facts of the case. A\r\nstill more violent difference was presented in the British parliament,\r\nin the year 1797, when there were great debates in both houses on the\r\nsubject, and when the facts were still more glaring, one of them being\r\nthat the reign of terror established by the Irish Government prevented\r\nthe press from reporting the maddening atrocities which the ruling\r\nfaction was daily perpetrating against the mass of the king's\r\nsubjects. The debate arose in the Lords, on a motion by Lord Moira\r\nfor an address to the king on the state of Ireland. He described the\r\nhorrors of which he had been recently a witness, but softened the\r\nrecital, lest he should shock his hearers too much. Orange loyalty\r\nwas then licensed and let loose upon the defenceless Roman Catholic\r\npopulation in Ulster. Lord Gosford's description of the scenes of\r\ndesolation in his own county, Armagh, is well known. He did what\r\nhe could to prevent the burning of Roman Catholic houses, and the\r\npersonal injuries inflicted upon the unfortunate inhabitants, while\r\ntheir Orange neighbours chased them out of the country, giving them\r\nCromwell's alternative. But his mercy injured his reputation, and he\r\nfelt obliged to protest solemnly that he was a loyal man, and that he\r\nwished to uphold Protestant ascendancy in Ireland as much as any of\r\nhis accusers. He only asked that the poor Catholic should be allowed\r\nto live in peace. In the debate referred to, Lord Moira declared that\r\nninety-one householders had been banished from one of his own estates;\r\nand many of them wounded in their persons. The discontent, he said,\r\nwas not confined to one sect. He ascribed the state of things to the\r\nrecall of Lord Fitzwilliam, which crushed the hopes of the Catholics,\r\nand gave unbounded licence to the yeomanry, who were empowered to act\r\nwith a vigour beyond the law; to turn out, banish, or kill the king's\r\nsubjects, on mere suspicion, often prompted by private malice, and\r\nhaving no better warrant than anonymous information. But for all this\r\nthe Irish parliament and the new reactionary viceroy freely granted\r\nacts of indemnity. According to Earl Fitzwilliam 'whole parishes,\r\nbaronies, and even counties, were declared to be out of the king's\r\npeace.'\r\n\r\nMr. Fox brought forward a similar motion in the House of Commons,\r\npleading the cause of justice and humanity in a noble speech, and\r\nboldly affirming principles of government for Ireland, which\r\nMr. Gladstone, Mr. Chichester Fortescue, and Mr. Bright are now\r\nendeavouring to have carried out by the imperial parliament after\r\nseventy years of concession, extorted by three rebellions. Mr. Fox\r\nexpressed his abhorrence of 'the truly diabolical maxim' of '_Divide\r\nel impera_,' by which the government of Ireland was conducted. He\r\nhoped that the discontent which threatened the separation of Ireland\r\nwould be dissipated without the necessity of war. 'But now,' he said,\r\n'the extremity of rigour has been tried--the severity of despotism has\r\nbeen let loose--and the Government is driven to that state when the\r\nlaws are not to be put into execution, but to be superseded.' The\r\nmotion was seconded by Sir Francis Burdett, who said: 'Whoever has\r\nseen Ireland, has seen a country where the fields are desolated, and\r\nthe prisons overflowing with the victims of oppression--has seen the\r\nshocking contrast between a profligate, extravagant Government, and\r\nan enslaved and impoverished people.' The motion was rejected by\r\na majority of 136. Lord Moira made a last and an almost despairing\r\nappeal on November 22, in the same year. In his speech he said:\r\n'I have seen in that country a marked distinction made between the\r\nEnglish and the Irish. I have seen troops that have been sent full of\r\nthis prejudice, that every inhabitant of that kingdom is a rebel to\r\nthe British Government. I have seen the most wanton insults practised\r\nupon men of all ranks and conditions. I have seen the most grievous\r\noppression exercised, in consequence of a presumption that the person\r\nwho was the unfortunate object of such oppression was in hostility to\r\nthe Government; and yet that has been done in a part of the country\r\nas quiet and as free from disturbance as the city of London. He who\r\nstates these things should be prepared with proofs. I am prepared with\r\nthem.' He then went into a number of horrifying details, and concluded\r\nas follows: 'You say that the Irish are insensible to the benefits\r\nof the British constitution, and you withhold all these benefits from\r\nthem. You goad them with harsh and cruel punishments, and a general\r\ninfliction of insult is thrown upon the kingdom. I have seen, my\r\nlords, a conquered country held by military force; _but never did I\r\nsee in any conquered country such a tone of insult as has been adopted\r\nby Great Britain towards Ireland_. I have made a last effort. I acquit\r\nmy conscience; I have done my duty.'\r\n\r\nIn subsequent debates, the following sentiments were uttered by the\r\nleading Whig statesmen of the day: 'The treatment of Ireland,' said\r\nMr. Fox, 'was such as to harrow up the soul. It was shocking to think\r\nthat a nation of brothers was thus to be trampled on like the most\r\nremote colony of conquered strangers.... The Irish people have been\r\nscourged by the iron hand of oppression, and subjected to the horrors\r\nof military execution, and are now in a situation too dreadful for the\r\nmind to contemplate without dismay. After the inhuman dragooning\r\nand horrible executions, the recital of which makes the blood run\r\ncold--after so much military cruelty, not in one, but in almost every\r\npart of the country--is it possible for this administration to procure\r\nunanimity in Ireland?' On March 22, 1798, the Duke of Bedford moved an\r\naddress to the king, asking him to change his ministers, and alluding\r\nto the state of Ireland, as it was before the breaking out of the\r\nRebellion. He said: 'Were I to enter into a detail of the atrocities\r\nwhich have been committed in Ireland, the picture would appal the\r\nstoutest heart. It could be proved that the most shocking cruelties\r\nhave been perpetrated; but what could be expected if men kept in\r\nstrict discipline were all at once allowed to give loose to their fury\r\nand their passions?'\r\n\r\nLord Holland was persuaded that his majesty's ministers could not\r\ntranquillise Ireland even by conciliation. 'How could they conciliate\r\nwhose concessions are always known to be the concessions of weakness\r\nand of fear, and who never granted to the Irish--the most generous\r\npeople upon earth,--anything without a struggle or resistance?' Lord\r\nWilliam Russell, in June following, said: 'A man's loyalty was to\r\nbe estimated by the desire he testified to imbrue his hands in his\r\nbrother's blood.' Sheridan asked: 'After being betrayed, duped,\r\ninsulted--disappointed in their dearest hopes, and again thrown into\r\nthe hands of the rulers they detested and despised, was it impossible\r\nthey should feel emotions of indignation? The struggle is not one of\r\npartial disaffection, but it is a contest between the people and the\r\nGovernment.' Mr. Tierney said: 'It was certain the people were in arms\r\nagainst the Government, nor was it easy to conceive how--having been\r\nscourged, burnt, and massacred--they could have any other feeling than\r\naversion to that Government.'\r\n\r\nEvery motion on the subject in both houses was rejected by\r\noverwhelming majorities. So little impression did the reports of the\r\nappalling facts which were of daily occurrence in Ireland make upon\r\nthat Tory Government, that the speeches of ministers read exactly like\r\nthe speeches of Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Hardy, Lord Mayo, and Mr. Warren,\r\nin the past session. Lord Grenville, the home secretary, professed the\r\nmost profound respect for the independence of the Irish parliament,\r\nand he could not think of interfering in the least with its\r\nprivileges, however the empire might suffer from its excesses.\r\n'The motion of Lord Moira was not only unnecessary, it was highly\r\nmischievous.' He dwelt on the improved state of Ireland, and the\r\ntranquillity of the people. If there were partial excesses on the part\r\nof the military, they were unavoidable, and could only be deplored.\r\n'He was unable to discern what should alienate the affections of\r\nIreland. For the whole space of thirty years his majesty's Government\r\nhad been distinguished by the same uniform tenderness of regard,\r\nby the same undeviating adherence to the mild principles of a\r\nconciliatory system.... If any cruelties had been practised, they must\r\nhave been resisted by a high-spirited people. Were there no courts of\r\njustice? The conduct of the lord lieutenant was highly commendable.\r\nThe system recommended by Lord Moira would only tend to villify the\r\nIrish Government.' Then came the fatal announcement which sounded\r\nthe death-knell of thousands of the Irish people, and caused the\r\ndestruction of millions' worth of property. The home secretary said:\r\n'The contrary system must, therefore, be persevered in; and to\r\nthe spirited exertions of the British military should we owe the\r\npreservation of Irish laws, of Irish property, and of Irish lives!'\r\n\r\nTo this the Marquis of Downshire added 'that he was not afraid of the\r\neffects of coercion. Every concession had been made that could be made\r\ntowards Ireland. Every Catholic was as free as the safety of the\r\nstate would admit. Were the Catholics to have an equal share in the\r\ngovernment with the Protestants, the Government and the country would\r\nbe lost.'\r\n\r\nI will conclude by quoting the remarks of Mr. Fox, referred to above:\r\n'If you do not allay their discontent, there is no way but force to\r\nkeep them in obedience. Can you convince them by the musket that their\r\nprinciples are false? Can you prove to them by the bayonet that their\r\npretensions are unjust? Can you demonstrate to them by martial law\r\nthat they enjoy the blessings of a free constitution? No, it is said,\r\nbut they may be deterred from the prosecution of the objects which you\r\nhave determined to refuse. But on what is this founded? On the history\r\nof Ireland itself? No; for the history of Ireland proves that, though\r\nrepeatedly subdued, it could not be kept in awe by force; and the\r\nlate examples will prove the effect which severity may be expected\r\nto produce.... I would therefore concede; and if I found I had not\r\nconceded enough, I would concede more. I know of no way of governing\r\nmankind, but by conciliating them.... My wish is that the whole people\r\nof Ireland should have the same principles, the same system, the same\r\noperation of government. ... I would have the whole Irish government\r\nregulated by Irish notions and Irish prejudices; and I firmly\r\nbelieve, according to an Irish expression, the more she is under Irish\r\ngovernment, the more she will be bound to English interests. ... I\r\nsay, therefore, try conciliation, but do not have recourse to arms.'\r\nHe warned and implored in vain. The Union had been determined on; and\r\nit was thought that it could be effected only after the prostration of\r\ncivil war, into which, therefore, the unfortunate people were goaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPOVERTY AND COERCION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in the nineteenth century, without any relief for the Irish\r\npeasantry. The rebellion of '98, so cruelly crushed, left an abiding\r\nsense of terror in the hearts of the Roman Catholic population.\r\nTheir condition was one of almost hopeless prostration. The Union was\r\neffected without the promised relief from their religious disabilities\r\nwhich was to be one of its essential conditions. The established\r\nchurch was secured, the rights of property were secured, but there was\r\nno security for the mass of the people. Domestic politics were almost\r\nforgotten in the gigantic struggle with Napoleon, which exhausted\r\nthe energies of the empire. Any signs of political life that showed\r\nthemselves in Ireland were connected with Catholic emancipation, and\r\nthe visit of George IV., in 1820, held forth promises of relief which\r\nexcited unbounded joy. The king loved his Irish subjects, and would\r\nnever miss an opportunity of realising the good wishes for their\r\nhappiness which he had so often and so fervently expressed to his Whig\r\nfriends, when he was Prince Regent. O'Connell's agitation commenced\r\nsoon after, and in nine years after the royal visit emancipation was\r\nextorted by the dread of civil war, frankly avowed by the Duke of\r\nWellington and Sir Robert Peel. But this boon left the masses nearly\r\nwhere they had been, only more conscious of their power, and more\r\ndetermined to use it, in the removal of their grievances.\r\n\r\nLord Redesdale, writing to Lord Eldon in 1821, said:--'In England\r\nthe machine goes on almost of itself, and therefore a bad driver\r\nmay manage it tolerably well. It is not so in Ireland. The country\r\nrequires great exertion to bring it into a state of order and\r\nsubmission to law. The whole population--high and low, rich and poor,\r\nCatholic and Protestant--must all be brought to obedience to law; all\r\nmust be taught to look up to the law for protection. The gentry are\r\nready enough to attend grand juries, to obtain presentments for their\r\nown benefit, but they desert the quarter-sessions of the peace. The\r\nfirst act of a constable in arresting must not be to knock down the\r\nprisoner; and many, many reforms must be made, which only can be\r\neffected by a judicious and able Government _on the spot_. Ireland, in\r\nits present state, cannot be governed in England. If insubordination\r\ncompels you to give, how are you to retain by law what you propose to\r\nmaintain while insubordination remains? It can only be by establishing\r\ncompletely the empire of the law.'\r\n\r\nSir Archibald Alison ascribed the unhappy relations of classes in\r\nIreland to what he calls 'the atrocious system of confiscation, which,\r\nin conformity with feudal usages, the victors introduced on every\r\noccasion of rebellion against their authority.' Sir George Nicholls\r\nhas shown, in his valuable history of the Irish poor law, that as\r\nearly as 1310 the parliament assembled at Kilkenny resolved that none\r\nshould keep Irish, or kern, in time of peace to live upon the poor of\r\nthe country; 'but those which will have them shall keep them at their\r\nown charges, so that the free tenants and farmers be not charged with\r\nthem.' And 130 years afterwards, the parliament assembled in Dublin\r\ndeclared that divers of the English were in the habit of maintaining\r\nsundry thieves, robbers, and rebels, and that they were to be adjudged\r\ntraitors for so doing, and suffer accordingly. In 1450, this class\r\nof depredators had increased very much, and by their 'thefts and\r\nmanslaughters caused the land to fall into decay, poverty wasting it\r\nevery day more and more; whereupon it was ordained that it should\r\nbe lawful for every liege man to kill or take notorious thieves, and\r\nthieves found robbing, spoiling, or breaking houses; and that every\r\nman that kills or takes any such thieves shall have one penny of every\r\nplough, and one farthing of every cottage within the barony where the\r\nmanslaughter is done, for every thief.' These extracts show a very\r\nbarbarous state of society, but Sir George Nicholls remarks that\r\nat the same period the condition of England and Scotland was very\r\nsimilar, save only that that of Ireland was aggravated by the civil\r\nconflicts between the colonists and the natives. There were some\r\nefforts made in Ireland, by various enactments, to put down this evil,\r\nand to provide employment for the large numbers that were disposed to\r\nprey upon the industry of their neighbours, by robbery, beggary, and\r\ndestruction of property. But while there was a legal provision made\r\nfor the poor in England, there was none in Ireland, where the people\r\nwere, _en masse_, deprived of the means of self-support by the action\r\nof the Government. Hence, so late as the year 1836, the poor-law\r\ncommissioners reported to the following effect:--\r\n\r\nIt appeared that in Great Britain the agricultural families\r\nconstituted little more than a fourth, whilst in Ireland they\r\nconstituted about two-thirds, of the whole population; that there\r\nwere in Great Britain, in 1831, 1,055,982 agricultural labourers;\r\nin Ireland, 1,131,715, although the cultivated land of Great Britain\r\namounted to about 34,250,000 acres and that of Ireland only to about\r\n14,600,000. So that there were in Ireland about five agricultural\r\nlabourers for every two that there were for the same quantity of land\r\nin Great Britain. It further appeared that the agricultural progress\r\nof Great Britain was more than four times that of Ireland; in which\r\nagricultural wages varied from sixpence to one shilling a day; the\r\naverage of the country being about eightpence-halfpenny; and that the\r\nearnings of the labourers came, on an average of the whole class, to\r\nfrom two shillings to two and sixpence a week or thereabouts for the\r\nyear round. Thus circumstanced, the commissioners observed, 'It is\r\nimpossible for the able-bodied in general to provide against sickness\r\nor the temporary absence of employment, or against old age, or the\r\ndestitution of their widows and children in the contingent event of\r\ntheir own premature decease. A great portion of them are, it is said,\r\ninsufficiently provided with the commonest necessaries of life. Their\r\nhabitations are wretched hovels, several of a family sleep together\r\non straw, or upon the bare ground, sometimes with a blanket, sometimes\r\neven without so much to cover them; their food commonly consists of\r\ndry potatoes, and with these they are at times so scantily supplied as\r\nto be obliged to stint themselves to one spare meal in the day.\r\nThere are even instances of persons being driven by hunger to seek\r\nsustenance in wild herbs. They sometimes get a herring or a little\r\nmilk, but they never get meat except at Christmas, Easter, and\r\nShrovetide. Some go in search of employment to Great Britain, during\r\nthe harvest; others wander through Ireland with the same view. The\r\nwives and children of many are occasionally obliged to beg; but they\r\ndo so reluctantly and with shame, and in general go to a distance from\r\nhome, that they may not be known. Mendicity, too, is the sole resource\r\nof the aged and impotent of the poorer classes in general, when\r\nchildren or relatives are unable to support them. To it, therefore,\r\ncrowds are driven for the means of existence, and the knowledge that\r\nsuch is the fact leads to an indiscriminate giving of alms, which\r\nencourages idleness, imposture, and general crime.' Such was the\r\nwretched condition of the great body of the labouring classes in\r\nIreland; 'and with these facts before us,' the commissioners say, 'we\r\ncannot hesitate to state that we consider remedial measures requisite\r\nto ameliorate the condition of the Irish poor. What those measures\r\nshould be is a question complicated, and involving considerations\r\nof the deepest importance to the whole body of the people, both in\r\nIreland and Great Britain.'\r\n\r\nSir George Nicholls, who had been an English poor-law commissioner,\r\nwas sent over to Ireland to make preliminary enquiries. He found\r\nthat the Irish peasantry had generally an appearance of apathy and\r\ndepression, seen in their mode of living, their habitations, their\r\ndress and conduct; they seemed to have no pride, no emulation, to\r\nbe heedless of the present and careless of the future. They did not\r\nstrive to improve their appearance or add to their comforts: their\r\ncabins were slovenly, smoky, dirty, almost without furniture, or any\r\narticle of convenience or common decency. The woman and her children\r\nwere seen seated on the floor, surrounded by pigs and poultry: the man\r\nlounging at the door, which could be approached only through mud and\r\nfilth: the former too slatternly to sweep the dirt and offal from the\r\ndoor, the latter too lazy to make a dry footway, though the materials\r\nwere close at hand. If the mother were asked why she did not keep\r\nherself and her children clean with a stream of water running near the\r\ncabin, her answer invariably was--Sure, how can we help it? We are so\r\npoor.' The husband made the same reply, while smoking his pipe at the\r\nfire or basking in the sunshine. Sir George Nicholls rightly concluded\r\nthat poverty was not the sole cause of this state of things. He found\r\nthem also remarkable for their desultory and reckless habits. Though\r\ntheir crops were rotting in the fields from excessive wet, and every\r\nmoment of sunshine should be taken advantage of, yet if there was a\r\nmarket, a fair, or a funeral, a horse-race, a fight, or a wedding,\r\nforgetting everything else, they would hurry off to the scene of\r\nexcitement. Working for wages was rare and uncertain, and hence arose\r\na disregard of the value of time, a desultory, sauntering habit,\r\nwithout industry or steadiness of application. 'Such,' he proceeds,\r\n'is too generally the character and such the habits of the Irish\r\npeasantry; and it may not be uninstructive to mark the resemblance\r\nwhich these bear to the character and habits of the English peasantry\r\nin the pauperised districts, under the abuses of the old poor law.\r\nMendicancy and indiscriminate almsgiving have produced in Ireland\r\nresults similar to what indiscriminate relief produced in England--the\r\nlike reckless disregard of the future, the like idle and disorderly\r\nconduct, and the same proneness to outrage having then characterised\r\nthe English pauper labourer which are now too generally the\r\ncharacteristics of the Irish peasant. An abuse of a good law caused\r\nthe evil in the one case, and a removal of that abuse is now rapidly\r\neffecting a remedy. In the other case the evil appears to have arisen\r\nrather from the want than the abuse of a law; but the corrective for\r\nboth will, I believe, be found to be essentially the same.'\r\n\r\nThe expectation that such a neglected people, made wretched by bad\r\nland laws, should be loyal, was surely unreasonable. For them,\r\nit might be said, there was no Government, no protection, no\r\nencouragement. There could not be more tempting materials for\r\nagitators to work upon. Lord Cloncurry vividly sketches the state\r\nof things resulting from the want of principle and earnestness among\r\npoliticians in dealing with Irish questions at that time.\r\n\r\n'From the Union up to the year 1829, the type of British colonial\r\ngovernment was the order of the day. The Protestants were upheld as\r\na superior caste, and paid in power and official emoluments for their\r\nservices in the army of occupation. During the second viceroyalty of\r\nLord Anglesea, an effort was made by him to evoke the energies of the\r\nwhole nation for its own regeneration. That effort was defeated by\r\nthe conjoint influence of the cowardice of the English cabinet,\r\nthe petulance of Mr. Stanley, and the unseasonable violence and\r\nselfishness of the lately emancipated popular leaders. Upon Lord\r\nAnglesea's recall the modern Whig model of statemanship was set up and\r\nfollowed: popular grievances were allowed to remain unredressed; the\r\ndiscontent and violence engendered by those grievances were used from\r\ntime to time for party purposes; the people were hung and bayoneted\r\nwhen their roused passions exceeded the due measure of factious\r\nrequirement; and the state patronage was employed to stimulate and\r\nto reward a staff of demagogues, by whom the masses were alternately\r\nexcited to madness, and betrayed, according to the necessities of the\r\nEnglish factions. When Russells and Greys were out or in danger, there\r\nwere free promises of equal laws and privileges and franchises for\r\noppressed Ireland; the minister expectant or trembling for his place,\r\nspoke loudly of justice and compensation, of fraternity and freedom.\r\nTo these key-notes the place-hunting demagogue pitched his brawling.\r\nHis talk was of pike-making, and sword-fleshing, and monster marching.\r\nThe simple people were goaded into a madness, the end whereof was for\r\nthem suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the hulks, and the gallows;\r\nfor their stimulators, silk gowns and commissionerships and seats on\r\nthe bench. Under this treatment the public mind became debauched; the\r\nlower classes, forced to bear the charges of agitation, as well as to\r\nsuffer its penalties, lost all faith in their social future; they saw\r\nnot and looked not beyond the momentary excitement of a procession or\r\na monster meeting.'\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, when introducing the Emancipation Bill, had to\r\nconfess the utter failure of the coercive policy which had been so\r\npersistently pursued. He showed that Ireland had been governed, since\r\nthe Union, almost invariably by coercive acts. There was always some\r\npolitical organisation antagonistic to the British Government. The\r\nCatholic Association had just been suppressed; but another would soon\r\nspring out of its ashes, if the Catholic question were not settled.\r\nMr. O'Connell had boasted that he could drive a coach-and-six through\r\nthe former act for its suppression; and Lord Eldon had engaged to\r\ndrive 'the meanest conveyance, even a donkey cart, through the act of\r\n1829.' The new member for Oxford (Sir Robert Inglis) also stated that\r\ntwenty-three counties in Ireland were prepared to follow the example\r\nof Clare. 'What will you do,' asked Sir Robert Peel, 'with that power,\r\nthat tremendous power, which the elective franchise, exercised\r\nunder the control of religion, at this moment confers upon the Roman\r\nCatholics? What will you do with the thirty or forty seats that will\r\nbe claimed in Ireland by the persevering efforts of the agitators,\r\ndirected by the Catholic Association, and carried out by the agency\r\nof every priest and bishop in Ireland?' If Parliament began to recede\r\nthere could be no limit to the retrogression. Such a course would\r\nproduce a reaction, violent in proportion to the hopes that had been\r\nexcited. Fresh rigours would become necessary; the re-enactment of the\r\npenal code would not be sufficient. They must abolish trial by jury,\r\nor, at least, incapacitate Catholics from sitting on juries. 2,000,000\r\nof Protestants must have a complete monopoly of power and privilege in\r\na country which contained 5,000,000 of Catholics, who were in most\r\nof the country four to one--in some districts twenty to one--of the\r\nProtestants. True, there were difficulties in the way of a settlement.\r\n'But,' asked Sir Robert Peel, 'what great measure, which has stamped\r\nits name upon the era, has ever been carried without difficulty?\r\n\r\nAt the present moment there is a loud cry in the English press for the\r\nsuspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and for the old remedy, coercion.\r\nThose who raise the cry would do well to read Mr. Shiel's speech at\r\nthe Clare election in 1828. He said:--\r\n\r\n'We have put a great engine into action, and applied the entire force\r\nof that powerful machinery which the law has placed under our control.\r\nWe are masters of the passions of the people, and we have employed\r\nour dominion with a terrible effect. But, sir, do you, or does any man\r\nhere, imagine that we could have acquired this formidable ability to\r\nsunder the strongest ties by which the different classes of society\r\nare fastened, unless we found the materials of excitement in the state\r\nof society itself? Do you think that Daniel O'Connell has himself,\r\nand by the single powers of his own mind, unaided by any external\r\nco-operation, brought the country to this great crisis of agitation?\r\nMr. O'Connell, with all his talent for excitation, would have been\r\nutterly powerless and incapable, unless he had been allied with a\r\ngreat conspirator against the public peace; and I will tell you who\r\nthat confederate is--it is the law of the land itself that has been\r\nMr. O'Connell's main associate, and that ought to be denounced as the\r\nmighty agitator of Ireland. The rod of oppression is the wand of this\r\nenchanter, and the book of his spells is the penal code? Break the\r\nwand of this political Prospero, and take from him the volume of his\r\nmagic, and he will evoke the spirits which are now under his control\r\nno longer. But why should I have recourse to illustration, which may\r\nbe accounted fantastical, in order to elucidate what is in itself\r\nso plain and obvious? Protestant gentlemen, who do me the honour to\r\nlisten to me, look, I pray you, a little dispassionately at the real\r\ncauses of the events which have taken place amongst you.... In no\r\nother country, except in this, would such a revolution have been\r\neffected. Wherefore? Because in no other country are the people\r\ndivided by the law from their superiors, and cast into the hands of a\r\nset of men who are supplied with the means of national excitement\r\nby the system of government under which we live. Surely, no man can\r\nbelieve that such an anomalous body as the Catholic Association could\r\nexist excepting in a community that has been alienated from the state\r\nby the state itself. The discontent and the resentment of 7,000,000\r\nof the population have generated that domestic government which sways\r\npublic opinion, and uses the national passions as the instruments\r\nof its will. It would be utterly impossible, if there were no\r\nexasperating distinctions amongst us, to create any artificial causes\r\nof discontent. Let men declaim for a century, and if they have no real\r\ngrievance their harangues will be empty sound and idle air. But\r\nwhen what they tell the people is true--when they are sustained by\r\nsubstantial facts, effects are produced of which what has taken place\r\nat this election is only an example. The whole body of the people\r\nhaving been previously excited, the moment any incident such as this\r\nelection occurs, all the popular passions start simultaneously up, and\r\nbear down every obstacle before them. Do not, therefore, be surprised\r\nthat the peasantry should throw off their allegiance when they are\r\nunder the operation of emotions which it would be wonderful if they\r\ncould resist. The feeling by which they are actuated would make them\r\nnot only vote against their landlord, but would make them scale the\r\nbatteries of a fortress, and mount the breach; and, gentlemen, give\r\nme leave to ask you whether, after due reflection upon the motives by\r\nwhich your vassals (for so they are accounted) are governed, you will\r\nbe disposed to exercise any measure of severity in their regard?'\r\n\r\nThe greatest warrior of the age rebuked the men who cried in that day\r\nthat the sword should be the arbiter of the Irish question; and Sir\r\nRobert Peel, in his own vindication of the Emancipation Act, said:--\r\n\r\n'I well know that there are those upon whom such considerations as\r\nthese to which I have been adverting will make but a faint impression.\r\nTheir answer to all such appeals is the short, in their opinion the\r\nconclusive, declaration--\" The Protestant constitution in church\r\nand state must be maintained at all hazards, and by any means; the\r\nmaintenance of it is a question of principle, and every concession\r\nor compromise is the sacrifice of principle to a low and vulgar\r\nexpediency.\" This is easily said; but how was Ireland to be governed?\r\nHow was the Protestant constitution in church and state to be\r\nmaintained in that part of the empire? Again I can anticipate the\r\nreply--\"By the overwhelming sense of the people of Great Britain; by\r\nthe application, if necessary, of physical force for the maintenance\r\nof authority; by the employment of the organised strength of\r\ngovernment, the police and the military, to enforce obedience to the\r\nlaw.\" I deliberately affirm that a minister of the crown, responsible\r\nat the time of which I am speaking for the public peace and the public\r\nwelfare, would have grossly and scandalously neglected his duty if he\r\nhad failed to consider whether it might not be possible that the fever\r\nof political and religious excitement which was quickening the pulse\r\nand fluttering the bosom of the whole Catholic population--which had\r\ninspired the serf of Clare with the resolution and energy of a free\r\nman--which had, in the twinkling of an eye, made all considerations of\r\npersonal gratitude, ancient family connection, local preferences, the\r\nfear of worldly injury, the hope of worldly advantage, subordinate\r\nto the all-absorbing sense of religious obligation and public\r\nduty--whether, I say, it might not be possible that the contagion of\r\nthat feverish excitement might spread beyond the barriers which,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, the habits of military obedience and\r\nthe strictness of military discipline opposed to all such external\r\ninfluences.'\r\n\r\nThe officer who commanded the military force in Clare during the\r\nelection, testified, as the result of his observation there, that,\r\neven in the constabulary and the army, the sympathies of a common\r\ncause, political and religious, could not be altogether repressed,\r\nand that implicit reliance could not long be placed on the effect of\r\ndiscipline and the duty of obedience. On July 20, Lord Anglesea wrote\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n'We hear occasionally of the Catholic soldiers being ill-disposed, and\r\nentirely under the influence of the priests. One regiment of infantry\r\nis said to be divided into Orange and Catholic factions. It is certain\r\nthat, on July 12, the guard at the castle had Orange lilies about\r\nthem.' On July 26, the viceroy wrote another letter, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract:--'The priests are using very inflammatory\r\nlanguage, and are certainly working upon the Catholics of the army.\r\nI think it important that the depôts of Irish recruits should be\r\ngradually removed, under the appearance of being required to join\r\ntheir regiments, and that whatever regiments are sent here should be\r\nthose of Scotland, or, at all events, of men not recruited from the\r\nsouth of Ireland. I desired Sir John Byng to convey this opinion to\r\nLord Hill.'\r\n\r\nEmancipation was carried, and the people were disaffected still.\r\nAnd why should they not be disaffected still? Emancipation had\r\ndone nothing for them. The farmers were still at the mercy of the\r\nlandlords, whose pride they humbled at the hustings of Clare and\r\nWaterford. They were still tormented by the tithe-proctor seizing the\r\ntenth of all that their labour produced on the land. The labourers\r\nwere still wretched, deprived of the forty-shilling freehold, which\r\nprotected them from the horrors of eviction and of transportation in\r\na floating hell across the Atlantic. I well remember the celebrated\r\nanti-tithe war in 1831, as well as the system by which it was\r\nprovoked, and I can bear witness to the accuracy of the following\r\ndescription of the tithe-proctor by Henry Grattan. He said:--\r\n\r\n'The use of the tithe-farmer is to get from the parishioners what the\r\nparson would be ashamed to demand, and so enable the parson to absent\r\nhimself from his duty. The powers of the tithe-farmer are summary laws\r\nand ecclesiastical courts; his livelihood is extortion; his rank in\r\nsociety is generally the lowest; and his occupation is to pounce on\r\nthe poor in the name of the Lord! He is a species of wolf left by\r\nthe shepherd to take care of the flock in his absence.' A single\r\ntithe-proctor had on one occasion processed 1,100 persons for tithes,\r\nnearly all of the lower order of farmers or peasants, the expense of\r\neach process being about 8 s. They had heard of opinions delivered\r\nin parliament, on the platform, and from the press by Protestant\r\nstatesmen of the highest consideration, that it was a cruel oppression\r\nto extort in that manner from the majority of the tillers of the soil\r\nthe tenth of its produce, in order to support the clergy of another\r\nchurch, who, in many cases, had no flocks, or only a few followers,\r\nwho were well able to pay for their own religious instruction. The\r\nsystem would be intolerable even were the state clergy the pastors of\r\nthe majority; but as the proportion between the Protestants and the\r\nRoman Catholics was in many parts as one to ten, and in some as one to\r\ntwenty, the injustice necessarily involved in the mode of levying the\r\nimpost was aggravated a hundredfold. It would be scarcely possible\r\nto devise any mode of levying an impost more exasperating, which\r\ncame home to the bosoms of men with more irritating, humiliating,\r\nand maddening power, and which violated more recklessly men's natural\r\nsense of justice. If a plan were devised for the purpose of driving\r\nmen into insurrection, nothing could be more effectual than\r\nthe tithe-proctor system. Besides, it tended directly to the\r\nimpoverishment of the country, retarding agricultural improvement and\r\nlimiting production. If a man kept all his land in pasture, he escaped\r\nthe impost; but the moment he tilled it, he was subjected to a tax of\r\nten per cent. on the gross produce. The valuation being made by the\r\ntithe-proctor--a man whose interest it was to defraud both the tenant\r\nand the parson--the consequence was, that the gentry and the large\r\nfarmers, to a great extent, evaded the tax, and left the small\r\noccupiers to bear nearly the whole burden; they even avoided mowing\r\nthe meadows in some cases, because then they should pay tithe for the\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nThere was besides a tax called church cess, levied by Protestants in\r\nvestry meetings upon Roman Catholics for cleaning the church, ringing\r\nthe bell, washing the minister's surplice, purchasing bread and wine\r\nfor the communion, and paying the salary of the parish clerk. This\r\ntax was felt to be a direct and flagrant violation of the rights of\r\nconscience, and of the principles of the British constitution; and\r\nagainst it there was a determined opposition, which manifested itself\r\nin tumultuous and violent assemblages at the parish churches all\r\nover the country on Easter Monday, when the rector or his curate, as\r\nchairman of the meeting, came into angry collision with flocks who\r\ndisowned him, and denounced him as a tyrant, a persecutor, and a\r\nrobber.\r\n\r\nBut the tithe impost was the one most grievously felt, and at last the\r\npeasantry resolved to resist it by force.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more violent than the contrasts presented at this\r\ntime in the social life of Ireland. On the one side there was a rapid\r\nsuccession of atrocities and tragedies fearful to contemplate: the\r\nbailiffs, constabulary, and military driving away cattle, sheep, pigs,\r\nand geese to be sold by public auction, to pay the minister who had no\r\ncongregation to whom he could preach the gospel; the cattle-prisons\r\nor 'pounds' surrounded by high walls, but uncovered, wet and dirty,\r\ncrowded with all sorts of animals, cold and starved, and uttering\r\ndoleful sounds; the driving away of the animals in the night from one\r\nfarm to another to avoid seizures; the auctions without bidders,\r\nin the midst of groaning and jeering multitudes; the slaughter\r\nof policemen, and in some instances of clergymen, with fiendish\r\nexpressions of hatred and yells of triumph; the mingling of fierce\r\npassions with the strongest natural affections; the exultation in\r\nmurder as if it were a glorious deed of war; the Roman Catholic press\r\nand platform almost justifying those deeds of outrage and blood; the\r\nmass of the Roman Catholic population sustaining this insurrection\r\nagainst the law with their support and sympathy and prayers, as if it\r\nwere a holy war, in which the victims were martyrs. On the other side\r\nwere presented pictures which excited the deepest interest of the\r\nProtestant community throughout the United Kingdom. We behold the\r\nclergyman and his family in the glebe-house, lately the abode of\r\nplenty, comfort, and elegance, a model of domestic happiness and\r\ngentlemanly life; but the income of the rector fell off, till he was\r\nbereft of nearly all his means. In order to procure the necessaries\r\nof life for his family, he was obliged to part with the cows that gave\r\nmilk for his household, the horse and car, which were necessary in the\r\nremote place where his glebe-house was situated, and everything that\r\ncould be spared, till at length he was obliged to make his greatest\r\nsacrifice, and to send his books--the dear and valued companions of\r\nhis life--to Dublin, to be sold by auction. His boys could no longer\r\nbe respectably clad, his wife and daughters were obliged to part with\r\ntheir jewellery and all their superfluities. There was no longer wine\r\nor medicine, that the mother was accustomed to dispense kindly and\r\nliberally to the poor around her, in their sickness and sorrow,\r\nwithout distinction of creed.\r\n\r\nThe glebe, which once presented an aspect of so much comfort and ease\r\nand affluence, now looked bare and desolate and void of life. But for\r\nthe contributions of Christian friends at a distance, many of\r\nthose once happy little centres of Christian civilisation--those\r\nwell-springs of consolation to the afflicted--must have been abandoned\r\nto the overwhelming sand of desolation swept upon them by the\r\nhurricane of the anti-tithe agitation.\r\n\r\nDuring this desperate struggle, force was employed on several\r\noccasions with fatal effect. At Newtownbarry, in the county of\r\nWexford, some cattle were impounded by a tithe-proctor. The peasantry\r\nassembled in large numbers to rescue them, when they came into\r\ncollision with the yeomanry, who fired, killing twelve persons. It was\r\na market day, and a placard was posted on the walls: 'There will be an\r\nend of church plunder; your pot, blanket, and pig will not hereafter\r\nbe sold by auction to support in luxury, idleness, and ease persons\r\nwho endeavour to make it appear that it is essential to the peace and\r\nprosperity of the country and your eternal salvation, while the most\r\nof you are starving. Attend to an auction of your neighbours' cattle.'\r\nAt Carrickshock there was a fearful tragedy. A number of writs against\r\ndefaulters were issued by the court of exchequer, and entrusted to\r\nthe care of process-servers, who, guarded by a strong body of police,\r\nproceeded on their mission with secrecy and dispatch. Bonfires along\r\nthe surrounding hills, however, and shrill whistles soon convinced\r\nthem that the people were not unprepared for their visitors. But\r\nthe yeomanry pushed boldly on. Suddenly an immense assemblage of\r\npeasantry, armed with scythes and pitchforks, poured down upon them.\r\nA terrible hand-to-hand struggle ensued, and in the course of a few\r\nmoments eighteen of the police, including the commanding officer,\r\nwere slaughtered. The remainder consulted safety and fled, marking the\r\ncourse of their retreat by the blood that trickled from their wounds.\r\nA coroner's jury pronounced this deed of death as 'wilful murder'\r\nagainst some persons unknown. A large government reward was offered,\r\nbut it failed to produce a single conviction. At Castlepollard, in\r\nWestmeath, on the occasion of an attempted rescue, the chief constable\r\nwas knocked down. The police fired, and nine or ten persons were\r\nkilled. One of the most lamentable of these conflicts occurred at\r\nGurtroe, near Rathcormac, in the county of Cork. Archdeacon Ryder\r\nbrought a number of the military to recover the tithes of a farm\r\nbelonging to a widow named Ryan. The assembled people resisted, the\r\nmilitary were ordered to fire, eight persons were killed and thirteen\r\nwounded; and among the killed was the widow's son.\r\n\r\nThese disorders appealed with irresistible force to the Government and\r\nthe legislature, to put an end to a system fraught with so much evil,\r\nand threatening the utter disruption of society in Ireland. In the\r\nfirst place, something must be done to meet the wants of the destitute\r\nclergy and their families. Accordingly, Lord Stanley brought in a\r\nbill, in May 1832, authorising the lord lieutenant of Ireland to\r\nadvance 60,000 l. as a fund for the payment of the clergy, who were\r\nunable to collect their tithes for the year 1831. This measure was\r\ndesigned to meet the present necessity, and was only a preliminary to\r\nthe promised settlement of the tithe question. It was therefore passed\r\nquickly through both Houses, and became law on June 1. But the money\r\nthus advanced was not placed on the consolidated fund.\r\n\r\nThe Government took upon itself the collection of the arrears of\r\ntithes for that one year. It was a maxim with Lord Stanley that the\r\npeople should be made to respect the law; that they should not\r\nbe allowed to trample upon it with impunity. The odious task thus\r\nassumed, produced a state of unparalleled excitement. The people were\r\ndriven to frenzy, instead of being frightened by the chief secretary\r\nbecoming tithe-collector-general, and the army being employed in\r\nits collection. They knew that the king's speech had recommended the\r\nsettlement of the tithe question. They had heard of the evidence of\r\nBishop Doyle and other champions, exposing what they believed to be\r\nthe iniquity of the tithe system. They had seen the condemnation of it\r\nin the testimony of the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, who declared\r\nhis conviction that it could not be collected except at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, and by keeping up a chronic war between the Government\r\nand the Roman Catholic people. They had been told that parliamentary\r\ncommittees had recommended the complete extinction of tithes, and\r\ntheir commutation into a rent-charge. Their own leaders had everywhere\r\nresolved:--\r\n\r\n'That it was a glaring wrong to compel an impoverished Catholic people\r\nto support in pampered luxury the richest clergy in the world--a\r\nclergy from whom, the Catholics do not experience even the return of\r\ncommon gratitude--a clergy who, in times past, opposed to the last\r\nthe political freedom of the Irish people, and at the present day\r\nare opposed to reform and a liberal scheme of education for their\r\ncountrymen. The ministers of the God of charity should not, by\r\nmisapplication of all the tithes to their own private uses, thus\r\ndeprive the poor of their patrimony; nor should ministers of\r\npeace adhere with such desperate tenacity to a system fraught with\r\ndissension, hatred, and ill-will.' The first proceeding of the\r\nGovernment to recover the tithes, under the act of June 1, was\r\ntherefore the signal for general war. Bonfires blazed upon the hills,\r\nthe rallying sounds of horns were heard along the valleys, and the\r\nmustering tread of thousands upon the roads, hurrying to the scene\r\nof a seizure or an auction. It was a bloody campaign; there was\r\nconsiderable loss of life, and the Church and the Government thus\r\nbecame more obnoxious to the people than ever. Lord Stanley being the\r\ncommander-in-chief on one side, and Mr. O'Connell on the other, the\r\ncontest was embittered by their personal antipathies. It was found\r\nthat the amount of the arrears for the year 1831 was 104,285 l., and\r\nthat the whole amount which the Government was able to levy, after\r\nputting forth its strength in every possible way, was 12,000 l., the\r\ncost of collection being 15,000 l., so the Government was not able to\r\nraise as much money as would pay the expenses of the campaign. This\r\nwas how Lord Stanley illustrated his favourite sentiment that the\r\npeople should be made to respect the law. But the Liberal party among\r\nthe Protestants fully sympathised with the anti-tithe recusants.\r\n\r\nOf course the Government did not persevere in prosecutions from which\r\nno parties but the lawyers reaped any advantage; consequently, all\r\nprocesses under the existing law were abandoned. It was found that,\r\nafter paying to the clergy the arrears of 1831 and 1832, and what\r\nwould be due in 1833, about a million sterling would be required,\r\nand this sum was provided by an issue of exchequer bills. The\r\nreimbursement of the advance was to be effected by a land tax.\r\nTogether with these temporary arrangements to meet the exigency of the\r\ncase, for the payment of the clergy and the pacification of Ireland,\r\nan act was passed to render tithe composition in Ireland compulsory\r\nand permanent. But Ireland was not yet pacified.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The foregoing sketch of the tithe war was written by the\r\nauthor seven years ago for Cassell's _History of England_, from which\r\nit is now extracted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had often been predicted by writers on the state of Ireland, that,\r\nowing to the rottenness at the foundation of the social fabric, it\r\nwould come down with a crash some day. The facts reported by the\r\ncensus commissioners of 1841 showed that this consummation could not\r\nbe far off. Out of a population of 8,000,000, there were 3,700,000\r\nabove the age of five years who could neither read nor write; while\r\nnearly three millions and a half lived in mud cabins, badly thatched\r\nwith straw, having each but one room, and often without either a\r\nwindow or a chimney. These figures indicate a mass of ignorance\r\nand poverty, which could not be contemplated without alarm, and the\r\nsubject was, therefore, constantly pressed upon the attention of\r\nparliament. As usual in cases of difficulty, the Government, feeling\r\nthat something should be done, and not knowing what to do, appointed\r\nin 1845 a commission to enquire into the relations between landlords\r\nand tenants, and the condition of the working classes. At the head of\r\nthis commission was the Earl of Devon, a benevolent nobleman, whose\r\nsympathies were on the side of the people. Captain Kennedy, the\r\nsecretary to the commissioners, published a digest of the report of\r\nthe evidence, which presented the facts in a readable form, and was\r\nthe means of diffusing a large amount of authentic information on the\r\nstate of Ireland. The commissioners travelled through the country,\r\nheld courts of enquiry, and examined witnesses of all classes. As the\r\nresult of their extensive intercourse with the farming classes, and\r\ntheir own observations, they were enabled to state that in almost\r\nevery part of Ireland unequivocal symptoms of improvement, in spite\r\nof many embarrassing and counteracting circumstances, continually\r\npresented themselves to the view, and that there existed a very\r\ngeneral and increasing spirit and desire for the promotion of such\r\nimprovement, from which the most beneficial results might fairly be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIndeed, speaking of the country generally, they add: 'With some\r\nexceptions, which are unfortunately too notorious, we believe that at\r\nno former period did so active a spirit of improvement prevail; nor\r\ncould well directed measures for the attainment of that object have\r\nbeen proposed with a better prospect of success than at the present\r\nmoment.'\r\n\r\nBut this improvement produced no sensible effect upon the condition\r\nof the labouring people. However brightly the sun of prosperity might\r\ngild the eminences of society, the darkness of misery and despair\r\nsettled upon the masses below. The commissioners proceed: 'A\r\nreference to the evidence of most of the witnesses will show that\r\nthe agricultural labourer of Ireland continues to suffer the greatest\r\nprivations and hardships; that he continues to depend upon casual and\r\nprecarious employment for subsistence; that he is still badly housed,\r\nbadly fed, badly clothed, and badly paid for his labour. Our personal\r\nexperience and observation during our enquiry have afforded us a\r\nmelancholy confirmation of these statements; and we cannot forbear\r\nexpressing our strong sense of the patient endurance which the\r\nlabouring classes have generally exhibited under sufferings greater,\r\nwe believe, than the people of any other country in Europe have to\r\nsustain.' It was deeply felt that the well-being of the whole United\r\nKingdom depended upon the removal of the causes of this misery and\r\ndegradation; for if the Irish people were not elevated, the English\r\nworking classes must be brought down to their level. The facility of\r\ntravelling afforded by railways and steam-boats caused such constant\r\nintercourse between England and Ireland, that Irish ignorance,\r\nbeggary, and disease, with all their contagion, physical and moral,\r\nwould be found intermingling with the British population. It would be\r\nimpossible to prevent the half-starved Irish peasantry from crossing\r\nthe Channel, and seeking employment, even at low wages, and forming a\r\npestiferous Irish quarter in every town and city. The question, then,\r\nwas felt to be one whose settlement would brook no further delay.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the potato was almost the only food of the Irish\r\nmillions, and that it formed their chief means of obtaining the other\r\nnecessaries of life. A large portion of this crop was grown under the\r\nsystem, to which the poorest of the peasantry were obliged to have\r\nrecourse, notwithstanding the minute subdivision of land. There were\r\nin 1841, 691,000 farms in Ireland exceeding one acre in extent.\r\nNearly one half of these were under five acres each. The number\r\nof proprietors in fee was estimated at 8,000--a smaller number, in\r\nproportion to the extent of territory, than in any other country of\r\nWestern Europe except Spain. In Connaught, several proprietors had\r\n100,000 acres each, the proportion of small farms being greater there\r\nthan in the rest of Ireland. The total number of farms in the province\r\nwas 155,842, and of these 100,254 consisted of from one to five acres.\r\nIf all the proprietors were resident among their tenantry, and were\r\nin a position to encourage their industry and care for their welfare,\r\nmatters would not have been so bad; but most of the large landowners\r\nwere absentees. It frequently happened that the large estates\r\nwere held in strict limitation, and they were nearly all heavily\r\nencumbered. The owners preferred living in England or on the\r\nContinent, having let their lands on long leases, or in perpetuity\r\nto 'middlemen,' who sublet them for as high rents as they could get.\r\nTheir tenants again sublet, so that it frequently happened that two,\r\nthree, or four landlords intervened between the proprietor and the\r\noccupying tenant, each deriving an interest from the land. The head\r\nlandlord, therefore, though ever so well disposed, had no power\r\nwhatever to help the occupying tenants generally, and of those who\r\nhad the power very few felt disposed. There were extensive districts\r\nwithout a single resident proprietor.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks after the blight of the potato crop in 1846 the\r\ncottiers and small farmers managed to eke out a subsistence by the\r\nsale of their pigs and any little effects they had. But pigs, fowl,\r\nfurniture, and clothing soon went, one after another, to satisfy the\r\ncravings of hunger. The better class of farmers lived upon their corn\r\nand cattle; but they were obliged to dismiss their servants, and this\r\nnumerous class became the first victims of starvation; for when they\r\nwere turned off, they were refused admission by their relations, who\r\nhad not the means of feeding them. Tailors, shoemakers, and other\r\nartisans who worked for the lower orders, lost their employment, and\r\nbecame destitute also. While the means of support failed upon every\r\nside, and food rose to such enormous prices that everything that\r\ncould possibly be eaten was economised, so that the starving dogs were\r\ndrowned from compassion, the famine steadily advanced from the west\r\nand south to the east and north, till it involved the whole population\r\nin its crushing grasp. It was painfully interesting to mark the\r\nprogress of the visitation, even in those parts of the country where\r\nits ravages were least felt. The small farmer had only his corn,\r\ndesigned for rent and seed: he was obliged to take it to the mill\r\nto ward off starvation. The children of the poor, placed on short\r\nallowance, were suffering fearfully from hunger. Mothers, heart-broken\r\nand worn down to skeletons, were seen on certain days proceeding\r\nin groups to some distant depôt, where Indian meal was to be had at\r\nreduced prices, but still double that of the ordinary market. As they\r\nreturned to their children, with their little bags on their heads, a\r\nfaint joy lit up their famine-stricken features.\r\n\r\nWhen the visitors entered a village their first question was: 'How\r\nmany deaths?' '_The hunger is upon us_,' was everywhere the cry; and\r\ninvoluntarily they found themselves regarding this hunger as they\r\nwould an epidemic, looking upon starvation as a disease. In fact, as\r\nthey passed along, their wonder was, not that the people died, but\r\nthat they lived; and Mr. W.G. Forster, in his report, said: 'I have\r\nno doubt whatever, that in any other country the mortality would have\r\nbeen far greater; and that many lives have been prolonged, perhaps\r\nsaved, by the long apprenticeship to want in which the Irish peasant\r\nhas been trained, and by that lovely, touching charity which prompts\r\nhim to share his scanty meal with his starving neighbour. But the\r\nsprings of this charity must be rapidly dried up. Like a scourge of\r\nlocusts, _the hunger_ daily sweeps over fresh districts, eating up all\r\nbefore it. One class after another is falling into the same abyss of\r\nruin.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Transactions during the Famine in Ireland, Appendix III.]\r\n\r\nThe same benevolent gentleman describes the domestic scenes he saw in\r\nConnaught, where the poor Celts were carried off in thousands:--\r\n\r\n'We entered a cabin. Stretched in one dark corner, scarcely visible\r\nfrom the smoke and rags that covered them, were three children huddled\r\ntogether, lying there because they were too weak to rise, pale and\r\nghastly; their little limbs, on removing a portion of the covering,\r\nperfectly emaciated; eyes sunk, voice gone, and evidently in the last\r\nstage of actual starvation. Crouched over the turf embers was another\r\nform, wild and all but naked, scarcely human in appearance. It stirred\r\nnot nor noticed us. On some straw, soddened upon the ground, moaning\r\npiteously, was a shrivelled old woman, imploring us to give her\r\nsomething, baring her limbs partly to show how the skin hung loose\r\nfrom her bones, as soon as she attracted our attention. Above her,\r\non something like a ledge, was a young woman with sunken cheeks, a\r\nmother, I have no doubt, who scarcely raised her eyes in answer to\r\nour enquiries; but pressed her hand upon her forehead, with a look\r\nof unutterable anguish and despair. Many cases were widows, whose\r\nhusbands had been recently taken off by the fever, and thus their only\r\npittance obtained from the public works was entirely cut off. In many\r\nthe husbands or sons were prostrate under that horrid disease--the\r\nresult of long-continued famine and low living--in which first the\r\nlimbs and then the body swell most frightfully, and finally burst. We\r\nentered upwards of fifty of these tenements. The scene was invariably\r\nthe same, differing in little but the manner of the sufferers, or of\r\nthe groups occupying the several corners within. The whole number was\r\noften not to be distinguished, until the eye having adapted itself\r\nto the darkness, they were pointed out, or were heard, or some filthy\r\nbundle of rags and straw was seen to move. Perhaps the poor children\r\npresented the most piteous and heart-rending spectacle. Many were\r\ntoo weak to stand, their little limbs attenuated, except where the\r\nfrightful swellings had taken the place of previous emaciation. Every\r\ninfantile expression had entirely departed; and, in some reason and\r\nintelligence had evidently flown. Many were remnants of families,\r\ncrowded together in one cabin; orphaned little relatives taken in by\r\nthe equally destitute, and even strangers--for these poor people are\r\nkind to each other, even to the end. In one cabin was a sister, just\r\ndying, lying beside her little brother, just dead. I have worse than\r\nthis to relate; but it is useless to multiply details, and they are,\r\nin fact, unfit.'\r\n\r\nIn December, 1846, Father Mathew wrote to Mr. Trevelyan, then\r\nsecretary of the treasury, that men, women, and children\r\nwere gradually wasting away. They filled their stomachs with\r\ncabbage-leaves, turnip-tops, &c., to appease the cravings of hunger.\r\nThere were then more than 5,000 half-starved wretches from the country\r\nbegging in the streets of Cork. When utterly exhausted, they crawled\r\nto the workhouse to die. The average of deaths in that union was then\r\nover a hundred a week.\r\n\r\nFrom December 27, in 1846, to the middle of April, in 1847, the number\r\nof human beings that died in the Cork workhouse was 2,130! And in the\r\nthird week of the following month the free interments in the Mathew\r\ncemetery had risen to 277--as many as sixty-seven having been buried\r\nin one day. The destruction of human life in other workhouses of\r\nIreland kept pace with the appalling mortality in the Cork workhouse.\r\nAccording to official returns, it had reached in April the weekly\r\naverage of twenty-five per 1,000 inmates; the actual number of deaths\r\nbeing 2,706 for the week ending April 3, and 2,613 in the following\r\nweek. Yet the number of inmates in the Irish workhouses was but\r\n104,455 on April 10.\r\n\r\nThe size of the unions was a great impediment to the working of\r\nthe poor law. They were three times the extent of the corresponding\r\ndivisions in England. In Munster and Connaught, where there was the\r\ngreatest amount of destitution, and the least amount of local agency\r\navailable for its relief, the unions were much larger than in the\r\nmore favoured provinces of Ulster and Leinster. The union of Ballina\r\ncomprised a region of upwards of half a million acres, and within\r\nits desert tracts the famine assumed its most appalling form, the\r\nworkhouse being more than forty miles distant from some of the\r\nsufferers. As a measure of precaution, the Government had secretly\r\nimported and stored a large quantity of Indian corn, as a cheap\r\nsubstitute for the potato, which would have served the purpose much\r\nbetter had the people been instructed in the best modes of cooking it.\r\nIt was placed in commissariat, along depôts the western coast of the\r\nisland, where the people were not likely to be supplied on reasonable\r\nterms through the ordinary channels of trade. The public works\r\nconsisted principally of roads, on which, the men were employed as\r\na sort of supplement to the poor law. Half the cost was a free grant\r\nfrom the treasury, and the other half was charged upon the barony\r\nin which the works were undertaken. The expense incurred under the\r\n'Labour Rate Act, 9 and 10 Viet. c. 107,' amounted to 4,766,789 l. It\r\nwas almost universally admitted, when the pressure was over, that\r\nthe system of public works adopted was a great mistake; and it seems\r\nwonderful that such grievous blunders could have been made with so\r\nmany able statesmen and political economists at the head of affairs\r\nand in the service of the Government. The public works undertaken\r\nconsisted in the breaking up of good roads to level hills and fill\r\nhollows, and the opening of new roads in places where they were not\r\nrequired--works which the people felt to be useless, and at which they\r\nlaboured only under strong compulsion, being obliged to walk to them\r\nin all weathers for miles, in order to earn the price of a breakfast\r\nof Indian meal. Had the labour thus comparatively wasted been devoted\r\nto the draining, sub-soiling, and fencing of the farms, connected\r\nwith a comprehensive system of arterial drainage, immense and lasting\r\nbenefit to the country would have been the result, especially as\r\nworks so well calculated to ameliorate the soil, and guard against the\r\nmoisture of the climate, might have been connected with a system of\r\ninstruction in agricultural matters of which the peasantry stood so\r\nmuch in need, and to the removal of the gross ignorance which had so\r\nlargely contributed to bring about the famine. As it was, enormous\r\nsums were wasted. Much needless hardship was inflicted on the starving\r\npeople in compelling them to work in frost and rain when they were\r\nscarcely able to walk, and, after all the vast outlay, very few traces\r\nof it remained in permanent improvements on the face of the country.\r\nThe system of government relief works failed chiefly through the\r\nsame difficulty which impeded every mode of relief, whether public or\r\nprivate--namely, the want of machinery to work it. It was impossible\r\nsuddenly to procure an efficient staff of officers for an undertaking\r\nof such enormous magnitude--the employment of a whole people. The\r\noverseers were necessarily selected in haste; many of them were\r\ncorrupt, and encouraged the misconduct of the labourers. In many cases\r\nthe relief committees, unable to prevent maladministration, yielded\r\nto the torrent of corruption, and individual members only sought to\r\nbenefit their own dependants. The people everywhere flocked to the\r\npublic works; labourers, cottiers, artisans, fishermen, farmers, men,\r\nwomen, and children--all, whether destitute or not, sought for a share\r\nof the public money. In such a crowd, it was almost impossible to\r\ndiscriminate properly. They congregated in masses on the roads,\r\nidling under the name of work, the really destitute often unheeded\r\nand unrelieved because they had no friend to recommend them. All\r\nthe ordinary employments were neglected; there was no fishing, no\r\ngathering of sea-weed, no collecting of manure. The men who had\r\nemployment feared to lose it by absenting themselves for any other\r\nobject; those unemployed spent their time in seeking to obtain it. The\r\nwhole industry of the country seemed to be engaged in road-making. It\r\nbecame absolutely necessary to put an end to it, or the cultivation\r\nof the land would be neglected. Works undertaken on the spur of\r\nthe moment, not because they were needful, but merely to employ the\r\npeople, were in many cases ill chosen, and the execution equally\r\ndefective. The labourers, desirous to protract their employment, were\r\nonly anxious to give as little labour as possible, in which their\r\noverlookers or gangers in many cases heartily agreed. The favouritism,\r\nthe intimidation, the wholesale jobbing practised in many cases were\r\nshockingly demoralising.\r\n\r\nIn order to induce the people to attend to their ordinary spring work,\r\nand put in the crops, it was found necessary to adopt the plan of\r\ndistributing free rations. On March 20, therefore, a reduction of\r\ntwenty per cent. of the numbers employed on the works took place, and\r\nthe process of reduction went on until the new system of gratuitous\r\nrelief was brought into full operation. The authority under which this\r\nwas administered was called the 'Temporary Relief Act,' which came\r\ninto full operation in the month of July, when the destitution was at\r\nits height, and three millions of people received their daily rations.\r\nSir John Burgoyne truly describes this as 'the grandest attempt\r\never made to grapple with famine over a whole country.' Never in the\r\nhistory of the world were so many persons fed in such a manner by the\r\npublic bounty. It was a most anxious time--a time of tremendous\r\nlabour and responsibility to those who had the direction of this vast\r\nmachinery. A member of the Board of Works thus describes the feeling\r\nwhich no doubt pervaded most of those that were officially connected\r\nwith the administration of relief: 'I hope never to see such a winter\r\nand spring again. I can truly say, in looking back upon it even now,\r\nthat it appears to me not a succession of weeks and days, but one long\r\ncontinuous day, with occasional intervals of night-mare sleep. Rest\r\none could never have, when one felt that in every minute lost a score\r\nof men might die.' Mr. Trevelyan was then secretary of the treasury,\r\nand it was well that a man so enlightened, energetic, and benevolent\r\noccupied the post at such a time. He was indefatigable in his efforts\r\nto mitigate the calamity, and he wrote an interesting account of 'The\r\nIrish Crisis' in the _Edinburgh Review_. Having presented the dark\r\nside of the picture in faithfully recording the abuses that had\r\nprevailed, it is right to give Mr. Trevelyan's testimony as to the\r\nconduct of the relief committees during this supreme hour of the\r\nnation's agony. 'It is a fact very honourable to Ireland that among\r\nupwards of 2,000 local bodies to whom advances were made under this\r\nact, there is not one to which, so far as the Government is informed,\r\nany suspicion of embezzlement attaches.'\r\n\r\nThe following statement of the numbers receiving rations, and the\r\ntotal expenditure under the act in each of the four provinces,\r\ncompared with the amount of population, and the annual value assessed\r\nfor poor-rate, may serve to illustrate the comparative means and\r\ndestitution of each province:--\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|         |  Population |  Valuation |    Greatest    |   Total    |\r\n|         |             |            |   Number of    |Expenditure |\r\n|         |             |            |  Rations given |            |\r\n|         |             |            |      out       |            |\r\n|---------|-------------|------------|----------------|------------|\r\n|         |             |      £     |                |     £      |\r\n|Ulster   |  2,386,373  |  3,320,133 |     346,517    |   170,508  |\r\n|Leinster |  1,973,731  |  4,624,542 |     450,606    |   308,068  |\r\n|Munster  |  2,396,161  |  1,465,643 |   1,013,826    |   671,554  |\r\n|Counaught|  1,418,859  |  1,465,643 |     745,652    |   526,048  |\r\n|         |-------------|------------|----------------|------------|\r\n|         |  8,175,124  | 13,187,421 |   2,556,601    | 1,676,268  |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPrivate benevolence did wonders in this crisis. The British\r\nAssociation raised and distributed 269,302 l. The queen's letter,\r\nordering collections in the English churches, produced 200,738 l. But\r\nthe bounty of the United States of America transcended everything. The\r\nsupplies sent across the Atlantic were on a scale unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nMeetings were held in Philadelphia, Washington, New York, and other\r\ncities, in quick succession, presided over by the first men in the\r\ncountry. All through the States the citizens evinced an intense\r\ninterest, and a noble generosity worthy of the great Republic.\r\nThe railway companies carried free of charge all packages marked\r\n'Ireland.' Public carriers undertook the gratuitous delivery of\r\npackages intended for the relief of Irish distress. Storage to any\r\nextent was offered on the same terms. Ships of war, without their\r\nguns, came to the Irish shores on a mission of peace and mercy,\r\nfreighted with food for British subjects. Cargo after cargo followed\r\nin rapid succession, until nearly 100 separate shipments had arrived,\r\nour Government having consented to pay the freight of all donations of\r\nfood forwarded from America, which amounted in the whole to 33,000 l.\r\nThe quantity of American food consigned to the care of the Society of\r\nFriends was nearly 10,000 tons, the value of which was about 100,000\r\nl. In addition to all this, the Americans remitted to the Friends'\r\nCommittee 16,000 l. in money. They also sent 642 packages of clothing,\r\nthe precise value of which could not be ascertained. There was a very\r\nlarge amount of remittances sent to Ireland, during the famine, by\r\nthe Irish in the United States. Unfortunately, there are no records of\r\nthose remittances prior to 1848; but since that time we are enabled\r\nto ascertain a large portion of them, though not the whole, and their\r\namount is something astonishing. The following statement of sums\r\nremitted by emigrants in America to their families in Ireland, was\r\nprinted by order of Parliament:--During the years 1848, 460,180 l.;\r\n1849, 540,619 l.; 1850, 957,087 l. 1851, 990,811 l.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the American ships naturally excited great interest at\r\nthe various ports. 'On Monday, April 13,' writes Mr. Maguire, 'a noble\r\nsight might be witnessed in Cork harbour--the sun shining its welcome\r\non the entrance of the unarmed war-ship Jamieson, sailing in under a\r\ncloud of snowy canvas, her great hold laden with bread-stuffs for the\r\nstarving people of Ireland. It was a sight that brought tears to many\r\nan eye, and prayers of gratitude to many a heart. It was one of those\r\nthings which one nation remembers of another long after the day of\r\nsorrow has passed. Upon the warm and generous people to whom America\r\nliterally broke bread and sent life, this act of fraternal charity, so\r\ngracefully and impressively offered, naturally produced a profound and\r\nlasting impression, the influence of which is felt at this moment.'\r\n\r\nThe clergy, Protestant and Roman Catholic, almost the only resident\r\ngentry in several of the destitute districts, worked together on the\r\ncommittees with commendable zeal, diligence, and unanimity. Among the\r\nRoman Catholic clergy, Father Mathew was at that time by far the most\r\ninfluential and popular. The masses of the peasantry regarded him\r\nas almost an inspired apostle. During the famine months, he\r\nexerted himself with wonderful energy and prudence, first, in his\r\ncorrespondence with different members of the Government, earnestly\r\nrecommending and urging the speedy adoption of measures of relief;\r\nand next, in commending those measures to the people, dissuading the\r\nhungry from acts of violence, and preaching submission and resignation\r\nunder that heavy dispensation of Providence. Of this there are ample\r\nproofs in the letters published by Mr. Maguire, M.P. 'It is not to\r\nharrow your feelings, dear Mr. Trevelyan,' he wrote, 'I tell this tale\r\nof woe. No; but to excite your sympathy in behalf of our miserable\r\npeasantry. It is rumoured that the capitalists in the corn and flour\r\ntrade are endeavouring to induce the Government not to protect the\r\npeople from famine, but to leave them at their mercy. I consider\r\nthis a cruel and unjustifiable interference. I am so unhappy at the\r\nprospect before us, and so horror-struck by the apprehension of our\r\ndestitute people falling into the ruthless hands of the corn and flour\r\ntraders, that I risk becoming troublesome, rather than not lay my\r\nhumble opinions before you.' Again: 'I hail with delight the humane,\r\nthe admirable measures for relief announced by my Lord John Russell;\r\nthey have given universal satisfaction. But of what avail will all\r\nthis be, unless the wise precautions of Government will enable the\r\ntoiling workman, after exhausting his vigour during a long day to earn\r\na shilling, to purchase with that shilling a sufficiency of daily food\r\nfor his generally large and helpless family?' Father Mathew earnestly\r\npleaded for out-door relief, in preference to the workhouse,\r\nforeseeing the danger of sundering the domestic bonds, which operate\r\nso powerfully as moral restraints in Ireland. The beautiful picture\r\nwhich he drew of the Irish peasant's home in his native land was\r\nnot too highly coloured, as applied to the great majority of the\r\npeople:--'The bonds of blood and affinity, dissoluble by death alone,\r\nassociate in the cabins of the Irish peasantry, not only the husband,\r\nwife, and children, but the aged parents and the married couple and\r\ntheir destitute relatives, even to the third and fourth degree of\r\nkindred. God forbid that political economists should dissolve these\r\nties! should violate these beautiful charities of nature and the\r\ngospel! I have often found my heart throb with delight when I beheld\r\nthree or four generations seated around the humble board and blazing\r\nhearth; and I offered a silent prayer to the great Father of all that\r\nthe gloomy gates of the workhouse should never separate those whom\r\nsuch tender social chains so fondly link together.'\r\n\r\nThe following is a tabular view of the whole amount of voluntary\r\ncontributions during the Irish famine, which deserves a permanent\r\nrecord for the credit of our common humanity:--\r\n\r\n                                             £    s. d.    £    s. d.\r\nLocal contributions officially reported\r\n  in 1846                                               104,689 18  1\r\nLocal contributions officially reported\r\n  in 1847                                               199,569  4  1\r\nBritish  Relief  Association, total\r\n  received                                470,041  1  2\r\n say five-sixths for Ireland              391,700 17  8\r\nGeneral Central Relief Committee,\r\n  College Green                            83,934 17 11\r\n Less received from British Relief\r\n  Association                              20,190  0  0\r\n                                          _____________  63,744 17 11\r\nIrish Relief Association, Sackville\r\n  Street                                                 42,446  5  0\r\nRelief Committee of the Society of\r\n  Friends, London                                        42,905 12  0\r\nCentral Relief Committee of the\r\n  Society of Friends, Dublin              198,313 15  3\r\n Less received from Committee of the\r\n   Society of Friends in London,\r\n   and interest                            39,249 19 11\r\n                                          _____________ 159,063 15  4\r\nIndian Relief Fund                                       13,919 15  2\r\nNational Club, London                                    19,928 12  2\r\nWesleyan Methodist Relief Fund,\r\n  London                                                 20,056 14  4\r\nIrish Evangelical Society, London                         9,264  9  9\r\nBaptists' Relief Fund, London                             6,141 11  2\r\nLadies' Irish Clothing Society, London      9,533  4  0\r\n Less received from British Association,\r\n  &c.                                       5,324 12 11\r\n                                          _____________   4,208 11  1\r\nLadies' Relief Association for Ireland     19,584  0  9\r\n Less received from Irish Relief\r\n  Association and for sales of\r\n  manufactures                              7,659  6  7\r\n                                          _____________  11,924 14  2\r\nLadies' Industrial Society for\r\n  encouragement of labour among the\r\n  peasantry                                 1,968 12  8\r\n Less received from Irish Relief\r\n  Association                               1,500  0  0\r\n                                          _____________     468 12  8\r\nBelfast Ladies' Association for the\r\n  relief of Irish Distress                                2,617  1  6\r\nBelfast Ladies' Industrial Association\r\n  for Connaught                                           4,615 16  1\r\nThere were also two collections in\r\n  Belfast for general purposes, the\r\n  amount of which exceeded                               10,000  0  0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTENANT-RIGHT IN ULSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Granard has taken a leading part in the movement for the\r\nsettling of the land question, having presided at two great meetings\r\nin the counties in which he has large estates, Wexford and Longford,\r\nsupported on each occasion by influential landlords. He was the first\r\nof his class to propose that the question should be settled on the\r\nbasis of tenant-right, by legalising and extending the Ulster custom.\r\nA reference to this custom has been frequently made recently, in\r\ndiscussions on the platform and in the press. I have studied the\r\nhistory of that province with care; and I have during the year 1869\r\ngone through several of its counties with the special object of\r\ninquiring how the tenant-right operates, and whether, and to what\r\nextent, it affords the requisite security to the cultivators of the\r\nsoil; and it may be of some service that I should give here the result\r\nof my enquiries.\r\n\r\nOf the six counties confiscated and planted in Ulster, Londonderry,\r\nas I have already remarked, was allotted to the London companies. The\r\naspect of their estates, is on the whole, very pleasing. In the midst\r\nof each there is a small town, built in the form of a square, with a\r\nmarket-house and a town-hall in the centre, and streets running off at\r\neach side. There are almost invariably three substantial and handsome\r\nplaces of worship--the parish church, always best and most prominent,\r\nthe presbyterian meeting-house, and the catholic chapel, with nice\r\nmanses for the ministers, all built wholly or in part by grants from\r\nthe companies.\r\n\r\nComplaints were constantly made against the Irish Society for its\r\nneglect of its trust, for refusing to give proper building leases, and\r\nfor wasting the funds placed at its disposal for public purposes. The\r\ndetails are curious and interesting, throwing much light on the\r\nsocial history of the times. The whole subject of its duties and\r\nresponsibilities, and of its anomalous powers, was fully discussed\r\nat a meeting of the principal citizens, most of them strongly\r\nConservative, on the 28th of May, 1866. There had been a discussion\r\non the subject in the House of Commons, in which Lord Claud Hamilton,\r\nthen member for the borough, distinguished himself. Mr. Maguire\r\nbrought the Society before Parliament in an able speech. The\r\nlegislature, as well as the public, were then preoccupied with the\r\nChurch question. But, doubtless, the maiden city will make her voice\r\nheard next session, and insist on being released from a guardian who\r\nalways acted the part of a stepmother.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Society has been before three parliamentary tribunals, the\r\nCommissioners of Municipal Corporations for England and Wales, the\r\nRoyal Commission of Enquiry into the state of the Corporation\r\nof London, and the Irish Municipal Commissioners. The English\r\nCommissioners say:--'We do not know of any pretext or argument for\r\ncontinuing this municipal supremacy of the Irish Society. A control\r\nof this kind maintained at the present day by the municipality of\r\none town in England over another town in Ireland, appears to us\r\nso indefensible in principle, that our opinion would not have been\r\nchanged, even if it were found that hitherto it has been conducted\r\nwith discretion and forbearance.'\r\n\r\nThe Irish commissioners affirmed 'that the Irish Society in their\r\noriginal institution were created for the purpose of forwarding the\r\ninterests and objects of the Plantation, and not for mere private\r\ngain; and that of the large income which they receive from their\r\npossessions in Londonderry, a very inadequate and disproportionate\r\nshare is applied for the public purposes, or other objects connected\r\nwith the local interests of the districts from which the revenues of\r\nthe society are drawn.'\r\n\r\nThe corporation of Derry cannot put a bye-law in force till it\r\nreceives the approval of the Irish Society. And what is this tribunal\r\nwhose fiat must stamp the decision of the Derry corporation before it\r\ncan operate in the smallest matter within the municipal boundary?\r\nThe members are London traders, totally ignorant of Ireland. They\r\nare elected for two years, so that they must go out by the time they\r\nacquire any information about their trust, to make way for another\r\nbatch equally ignorant. Having everything to learn during their term\r\nof office, if they have time or capacity to learn anything about\r\nthe matter, they must submit to the guidance of the governor, who is\r\nelected virtually, though not formally, for life; and the members of\r\nthe Derry corporation believe him to be the autocrat of the society.\r\nMr. James P. Hamilton, now the assistant-barrister for Sligo, at the\r\ngreat meeting of the citizens of Derry already mentioned, pronounced\r\nthe governors to be 'the most ignorant, the most incompetent, and the\r\nmost careless governors that ever were inflicted on a people.' Mr.\r\nHamilton quoted from the answer of the corporation of London in 1624\r\nto the Privy Council, which required them to convey 4,000 acres to\r\nthe citizens of Derry. The corporation replied that they had allotted\r\n1,500 acres for the use of the mayor and other civil officers. That\r\nwas either true or false. If true, by what right did they recall the\r\ngrant, and re-possess themselves of those lands? By the articles they\r\nwere bound to make quays, which were not made. They were bound to\r\ngive bog and mountain for the city common, which they never gave. The\r\ncorporation had a tract called the sheriffs mountain, but the city was\r\nrobbed of it by her cruel stepmother, the Irish Society. The society\r\nwas bound to give 200 acres for a free school, and if this had been\r\ndone Derry might have had a rich foundation, rivalling Westminster\r\nor the Charter School. Mr. Hamilton, conservative as he is, with the\r\nheart of a true Irishman, indignantly asks, 'Why is this national\r\ngrievance and insult continued for the profit of no one? Their very\r\nname is an insult and a mockery--_The Governor and Assistants, London,\r\nof the New Plantation in Ulster_! What do they govern? They don't\r\ngovern us in any sense of the word. They merely hold our property in\r\na dead grip, without any profit to themselves, and to our great\r\ndisadvantage.'\r\n\r\nThe city is overwhelmed with debt--debt for the new quays, debt for\r\nthe new bridge, debt for the public works of the corporation, which\r\nhas struggled to improve the city under the incubus of this alien\r\npower, contending with debt, want of tenure, and other difficulties,\r\nwhich would all have been avoided if the city had the lands which\r\nthese Londoners hold in their possession and use as their own pleasure\r\ndictates, half the revenues being spent in the management.\r\n\r\nMr. William Hazlett, a magistrate of Derry, one of its ablest and\r\nmost respected citizens, stated that from 1818 to 1847 the expenses\r\nof management were 60 per cent. The royal commissioners set it down\r\nthus--Total expenditure, 219,898 l.; management, 133,912 l. The\r\nlaw expenses were, during the same period, 40,000 l. 'This item\r\nof itself,' says Mr. Hazlett, 'must be considered an intolerable\r\ngrievance, for it was laid out for the oppression of the people who\r\nshould have benefited by the funds so squandered in opposing the\r\nvery parties who supplied the money, with which they were themselves\r\nharassed. If a tenant applies for a lease, and the society consents\r\nto grant one, it is so hampered with obstructive clauses that his\r\nsolicitor objects to his signing it, and says that from its nature it\r\ncould not be made a negotiable instrument on which to raise money. The\r\ntenant remonstrates, but the reply of the city is--\"That is our form\r\nof lease; you must comply with it or want!\" If you go to law with\r\nthem, they may take you into Chancery, and fight you with your own\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\nMr. Hazlett gave a remarkable illustration of this, which shows\r\nthe spirit in which this body thinks proper to fulfil its duties as\r\nsteward of this property. The Devon Land Commission recommended that\r\nleases of lives renewable for ever should be converted into fee-farm\r\ngrants, which would be a valuable boon to the tenant without any loss\r\nto the owner. A bill founded on the recommendation was introduced to\r\nparliament. Did the enlightened and liberal Irish Society hail\r\nwith satisfaction this wise measure of reform? On the contrary, the\r\ngovernor went out of his way to oppose it. Having striven in vain,\r\nwith all the vast influence of the corporation, to have the bill\r\nthrown out, he endeavoured to get the society exempted from its\r\noperation. When, in spite of his efforts, the bill became law, the\r\ngovernor utterly refused to act on it, and brought the matter before\r\nthe Master of the Rolls and the House of Lords. From these renewable\r\nleases the society had an income of about 2,500 l. yearly. And what\r\namount did they demand--these moderate and discreet gentleman, 'The\r\nGovernor and Assistants, London, of the new Plantation of Ulster'--for\r\ntheir interest in the renewable leases? Not less than 100,000 l., or\r\nabout 40 years' purchase. In the year 1765, when the city of Derry was\r\nfast hastening to decay under this London government, the society was\r\ninduced by an increase of 37 per cent. on the rent, to grant those\r\nrenewable leases. 'And but for the granting of those leases,' said Mr.\r\nHazlett, 'we should have no standing-ground in this city, nor should\r\nwe even have the right to meet in this hall as we do to-day.'\r\n\r\nOther striking facts illustrating the paternal nature of this foreign\r\ngovernment of the 'New Plantation' were produced by Mr. Thomas\r\nChambers, a solicitor who had defended the Rev. J.M. Staples in a suit\r\nbrought by the society, and which cost them 40,000 l. of the public\r\nmoney to win, after dragging the reverend gentleman from one court to\r\nanother, regardless of expense. Originally, as we have seen, the city\r\ngot a grant of 4,000 acres for the support of the corporation; but\r\nactually received only 1,500, valued then at 60 l., a year. This land\r\nwas forfeited and transferred to the bishop in the reign of Charles I.\r\nUltimately the bishop gave up the land and the fishery, for which the\r\nsee received, and still receives, 250 l. a year. The society got, hold\r\nof the 1,500 acres, and refused to give them back to the city, which,\r\nwith the alienation of the sheriff's mountain, and the raising of the\r\ncity rents (in 1820) from 40 l. to 600 l. a year, left it 1,000 l. a\r\nyear worse than it had been previously. The result of this policy of\r\na body which was established for promoting 'civility' in Ireland, was,\r\nthat the credit of the corporation went down rapidly. Executions were\r\nlodged against them, and all their property in quays, markets, &c.\r\nwas swept away, the bridge being saved only by the intervention of a\r\nspecial act of parliament. In 1831, however, the society granted the\r\ncorporation an allowance of 700 l. When the reformed corporation came\r\nin, and found that they were so far emancipated from the thraldom of\r\nthe London governor that they could go before parliament themselves,\r\nthe society was constrained to increase its dole to 1,200 l. a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaac Colhoun, at the meeting referred to, produced from the\r\naccounts of the society for the previous year, published in the local\r\npapers, the following items:--\r\n\r\n                                                       £     s.    d.\r\nAmount of the present increased income               11,091  17     5\r\n                                                     ________________\r\nIncidental expenses as per general agents' account\r\n  for 1865                                              114   3 0-1/2\r\nLaw expenses                                            492   7    11\r\nSalaries to general agent, deputy, vice-admiral,\r\n  surveyor, and others                                  926  16     6\r\nPension to general agent                                250   0     0\r\nVisitation expenses, 1865                               539  19     6\r\nSurveying expenses                                       50   0     0\r\nSalary of clerk and porter's wages                      197  10     0\r\nCoal, gas, printing, stationery, advertisements         449  11     5\r\nSalary to secretary and assistant governor, and\r\n  'assistants' for attendance at 51 meetings            549   1     6\r\n                                                     ________________\r\n                                                      4,094   1     6\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a trust fund amounting to about 12,000 l. a year, and\r\nthe trustees actually spend one-third in its management! And what\r\nis its management? What do they do with the money? Mr. Pitt Skipton,\r\nD.L., a landed proprietor, who has nothing to gain or lose by the\r\nIrish Society, asks, 'Where is our money laid out now? Not on the\r\nestate of the Irish Society, but on the estates of the church and\r\nprivate individuals--on those of owners like myself who give their\r\ntenants perpetuity, because it is their interest to do so. We should\r\nwish to see the funds of the society so expended that we could see\r\nsome memorial of them. But where is there in Derry any monument wholly\r\nerected by the society which they were not specially forced to put up\r\nby charter, with the exception of a paltry piece of freestone within\r\none of the bastions bearing their own arms.'\r\n\r\nLet us only imagine what the corporation of Derry could do in local\r\nimprovements with this 12,000 l. a year, which is really their own\r\nproperty, or even with the 4,000 l. a-year squandered upon themselves\r\nby the trustees! Some of these worthy London merchants, it seems, play\r\nthe _rôle_ of Irish landlords when travelling on the Continent, on\r\nthe strength of this Derry estate, or their _assistantship_ in its\r\nmanagement. 'I object,' says Mr. J.P. Hamilton, 'if I take a\r\nlittle run in the summer vacation to Paris or Brussels, to meet a\r\ngreasy-looking gentleman from Whitechapel or the Minories, turned out\r\nsleek and shining from Moses', and to be told by him that he has a\r\nlarge property in _Hireland_, in a place called Derry, and that his\r\ntenantry are an industrious, thriving set of fellows, quite remarkable\r\nfor their intelligence, but that it is all owing to his excellent\r\nmanagement of his property and his liberality.'\r\n\r\nMr. Hazlett presented a still funnier picture of the Irish\r\n'visitations' of the members of the society, with their wives and\r\ndaughters every summer. Gentlemen in London regard it as a fine lark\r\nto get elected to serve in the Irish Society, as that includes\r\na summer trip to Ireland free of expense, with the jolliest\r\nentertainment. One gentleman, being asked by another whether he was\r\never in Ireland, answered--'No, but I intend to get on the Irish\r\nSociety next year and then I'll have a trip. What kind of people are\r\nthey over there? Do they all speak Irish?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no; they are a very decent, civilised people.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'm glad they don't speak Irish; for none of us do, of course;\r\nbut my daughter can speak French.'\r\n\r\n'They had a great siege one time over there?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes; the Derry people are proud of the siege.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes, I see; happened in the reign of King John, I believe.'\r\n\r\nBut the heaviest charge laid at the door of the Irish Society is its\r\npersistent refusal to grant proper tenures for building. By this, even\r\nmore than their reckless squandering of the revenues of a fine estate,\r\nwhich is not their own, they have obstructed the improvement of the\r\ncity. They might possibly be compelled to refund the wasted property\r\nof their ward, but they could never compensate for stunting and\r\ncrippling her as they have done. Fortunately, there is a standard by\r\nwhich we are able to measure this iniquity with tolerable accuracy.\r\nDr. William Brown, of Derry, testified that it was the universal\r\nconviction of the people of Derry, of all classes and denominations,\r\nthat, by the mismanagement of their trust, the Irish Society had\r\nconverted the crown grant from the blessing it was intended to be, and\r\nwhich it would have been under a just administration, into something\r\nmore akin to a curse. For anything that saps the self-reliant and\r\nindependent spirit of a community must always be a curse. Within the\r\nlast hundred years Belfast was not in advance of Derry in population,\r\nin trade, in capital, or in any other element constituting or\r\nconducing to prosperity. Its river was not so navigable, and by no\r\nmeans so well adapted to foreign, especially transatlantic trade. The\r\ncountry surrounding it was not superior in soil, nor the inhabitants\r\nin intelligence and enterprise. It had no estate, as Derry had,\r\ngranted by the crown to assist in the development of civilisation,\r\neducation, and commerce. Its prospects, then, were inferior to those\r\nof Derry. But Belfast had the one thing, most needful of all, that\r\nDerry had not. It had equitable building tenures. And of this one\r\nadvantage, look at the result! 'Belfast is now seven times the size of\r\nDerry; and is in possession of a trade and a trade capital which Derry\r\ncan never hope to emulate, while smothered by the stick-in-the-mud\r\npolicy of that miserable anachronism the Irish Society.'\r\n\r\nThe London companies which have estates in the county Derry claimed\r\nto be entitled to all the surplus revenue after the cost of management\r\nwas deducted. This was the question raised by the celebrated\r\n'Skinners' case,' ultimately decided by the House of Lords. The effect\r\nof the decision was, that the society was a trustee, not for the\r\ncompanies but for the public objects defined in the charter and the\r\n'articles of agreement.' Lord Langdale's language on the subject is\r\nperfectly clear and explicit. He declared that the Irish Society have\r\nnot, 'collectively or individually,' any beneficial interest in the\r\nestates. In a sense they are trustees. They have important duties\r\nto perform; but their powers and duties have all reference to the\r\n_Plantation_, whose object was purely public and political.\r\n\r\nAdverting to this judgment, it is not Derry alone that is interested\r\nin the abolition of the Irish Society. Its objects 'affected the\r\ngeneral welfare of Ireland and the whole realm.' The city of London,\r\nin its corporate capacity, had no beneficial interest in the estates.\r\n'The money which it had advanced was early repaid, and the power which\r\nremained, or which was considered to remain, was, like that of the\r\nsociety, an entrusted power for the benefit of the plantation and\r\nthose interested in it. The Irish Society seems to have been little,\r\nif anything, more than the representative or instrument of the city\r\nfor the purposes of the Plantation.'\r\n\r\nI subjoin the text of the concluding part of the judgment in the\r\n_Skinners' Case_, the report of which fills a very bulky volume:--\r\n\r\nLord Langdale said: 'The mistaken views which the society may have\r\nsubsequently taken of its own situation and duties (and I think that\r\nsuch mistaken views have several times been taken) do not vary the\r\nconclusion to be deduced from the charter and the circumstances\r\ncontemporary with the grant of the first charter. I am of opinion that\r\nthe powers granted to the society and the trusts reposed in them were\r\nin part of a general and public nature, independent of the private\r\nbenefit of the companies of London, and were intended by the crown\r\nto benefit Ireland and the city of London, by connecting the city\r\nof Londonderry and the town of Coleraine and a considerable Irish\r\ndistrict with the city of London, and to promote the general purposes\r\nof the Plantation, not only by securing the performance of the\r\nconditions imposed on ordinary undertakers, but also by the exercise\r\nof powers and the performance of trusts not within the scope of those\r\nconditions. The charter of Charles II. expressly recites that the\r\nproperty not actually divided was retained for the general operation\r\nof the Plantation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTENANT-RIGHT IN DOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are sermons in stones I ought to have learned something from\r\nthe ruins of the castle built by Sir Arthur Hill, the founder of the\r\nhouse of Downshire, in which they show the chamber occupied by William\r\nIII. while his army was encamped at Blaris Moor. This was once a royal\r\nfort, and among the most interesting memorials of the past are the\r\nprimitive gates, long laid aside from duty, the timber gradually\r\nmouldering away from the huge nails, which once added to their massive\r\nstrength. Hillsborough was incorporated by Charles II., and sent two\r\nmembers to parliament. The Hills rose rapidly in rank and influence.\r\nIn 1717, Trevor Hill, Esq., was created Viscount of Hillsborough and\r\nBaron Hill. In 1756, Wills, the second viscount, was made Earl of\r\nHillsborough, and in 1789 he became Marquis of Downshire.\r\n\r\nHillsborough is the most perfect picture of a feudal establishment\r\nthat I know. On one side of the little, quiet, tradeless town are the\r\nruins of the old castle, with its park and its fine ancestral trees,\r\nthrough the thick foliage of which pierces the spire of the church,\r\nlofty and beautiful. On the other side, and quite close to the town,\r\nis 'the new castle'--an immense building of cut stone, in the Greek\r\nstyle, two storeys high, shut in by high walls from the view of the\r\ntownsfolk. Then there is the small market-square, with the court-house\r\nin the centre, the hotel at the top, and other buildings of a better\r\nclass on the opposite side. From the hill, which is crowned by these\r\nbuildings, descend small streets, in which dwell the inhabitants, all\r\nmore or less dependent on the lord of the manor, all cared for by him,\r\nand many of them pensioned when disabled by age or infirmity.\r\n\r\nThere is a monument erected to the memory of the late marquis's\r\nfather on a hill to the south of the town. The view from this point is\r\nglorious. Belfast lies a little beyond, enveloped in the smoke emitted\r\nfrom its numerous tall chimneys. To the left is the range of the\r\nAntrim highlands, continued along the coast of the Lough towards\r\nCarrickfergus, and from which the Cave Hill stands out in bold relief,\r\nlooking down on the numerous pretty villas with which the taste\r\nof wealthy manufacturers and merchants has adorned those pleasant\r\nsuburbs. Westward towards Lough Neagh, swelling gradually--southward\r\ntowards Armagh, and round to Newry, the whole surface of the country\r\ngently undulating, presents a vast picture of quiet beauty, fertility,\r\nand plenty that can be rivalled only in England. The tall crowded\r\nstocks along the ridges of the corn-fields attested the abundance of\r\nthe crops--the rich greenness and warmth of the landscape showing how\r\nwell the ground has been drained, manured, and cultivated. The neat,\r\nwhite-walled houses gleaming amidst the verdure of sheltering trees\r\nand trimmed hedges tell the thoughtful observer that the people who\r\ndwell in this land belong to it, are rooted in it, and ply their\r\nindustry under the happy feeling that, so far as their old landlords\r\nare concerned, their lot is one of 'quietness and assurance for ever.'\r\nNowhere--even on the high ranges about Newry, where the population is\r\nfar too dense, where the patchwork cultivation creeps up the mountain\r\nside, and the hand of industry snatches a precarious return from a\r\npoor, cold, ungrateful soil, amidst desolating tempests and blighting\r\nfogs--not even there did I notice the least trace of evictions or\r\nclearances. No black remnant of a wall tells that where sheep now\r\nbrowze and lambs frisk there was once a fireside, where the family\r\naffections were cherished, and a home where happy children played in\r\nthe sunshine. This is the field of capital and enterprise; here\r\nwe have an aristocracy of wealth, chiefs of industry, each of whom\r\nmaintains an army of 'hands' more numerous than the swordsmen of Shane\r\nO'Neill when he reigned in his castle yonder on the banks of Lough\r\nNeagh. But here also is the aristocracy of rank--lords of ancient\r\nlineage, descended from heroes--men who have left magnificent\r\nmonuments of their creative genius. They have not only founded great\r\nhouses, but they have laid deep and broad the foundations of a\r\nsocial system to whose strength and beauty every age has been adding\r\nsomething, and which now wants only one topmost stone to make it\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nI read on the monument to Lord Downshire the expressive motto of the\r\nDownshire family--_Per Deum et ferrum obtinui._ No family ever made\r\nbetter use of the power thus obtained. The inscription states that the\r\nthird marquis was 'alike distinguished for patriotism, rectitude of\r\nprinciple, and honesty of purpose. Upholding his station with becoming\r\ndignity, he was also mindful of the wants of others, and practised his\r\nduties with benevolence and humility, which won the regard of every\r\nvirtuous mind, adding lustre to his exalted rank.' Although these\r\nwords were engraved upon a monument by the friends and admirers of\r\ntheir object, they are perfectly true, and they would be equally true\r\nof the late marquis.\r\n\r\nLord Downshire is esteemed as the best of landlords. He charges 33 per\r\ncent. less for his land than it is worth--than the tenants would\r\nbe able to pay. Tenant-right on his property sells for an enormous\r\namount. He never evicts a tenant, nor even threatens to evict those\r\nwho vote against him. What he has done for the contentment and\r\nprosperity of his tenants, with so much honour and happiness to\r\nhimself, other landlords may do with like results. The late lord, his\r\nfather, and his grandfather pursued the same course. They let their\r\nlands at a low valuation. They encouraged improvements--they allowed\r\nthe free enjoyment of tenant-right; but they refused to allow\r\nsub-letting or subdivision of the land. They consolidated farms only\r\nwhen tenants, unable to retain small, worn-out holdings, wished to\r\nsell their tenant-right and depart. The consequence is that there is\r\ngreat competition for land on the Downshire estates. The tenant-right\r\nsells easily for 30 l. to 40 l. an Irish acre, the rent being on an\r\naverage about 28 s. If a tenant is not able to pay his way, he is let\r\nrun on in arrears perhaps for two or three years. Then he feels the\r\nnecessity of selling; but the arrears are deducted, and also debts\r\nthat he may owe to his neighbours, before he departs with the proceeds\r\nin his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe late marquis seems to have been almost idolised by the tenants. On\r\nor off the estate, in town or country, I have heard nothing of him\r\nbut praise of the warmest and most unqualified kind; and, what is more\r\nremarkable, his late agent, Mr. Filgate, was universally respected for\r\nhis fairness in the discharge of his duties. The way in which I heard\r\nthis spoken of by the people convinces me that there is nothing that\r\nwins their confidence so much as strict impartiality, and justice,\r\ncalmly, kindly, but firmly administered. The people to whom I spoke\r\nlaid stress on the fact that Mr. Filgate listened quietly to the\r\nstatements of both sides, carefully enquired into the merits of each,\r\nand decided accordingly. There was no favouritism, they said, no\r\npartiality; no hasty decision in a fit of anger, or passion, or\r\nimpatience; no refusal to listen to reason.\r\n\r\nI observed to one of the tenants, 'You admit that the rents are much\r\nlower than on other estates, much lower than the value of the lands,\r\nand that during the last twenty years the tenant-right has increased\r\nin value. Suppose, then, that the marquis should raise the rents, say\r\ntwenty-five per cent., what would be the consequence? Would they pay\r\nthe increase willingly?' 'Willingly!' he exclaimed, 'no, there would\r\nbe rebellion! The late lord could do anything with the people; he\r\ncould raise the country. But you see when they bought the tenant-right\r\nthey believed they could never be robbed of the value for which they\r\npaid by raising the rent.'\r\n\r\nWhat can be better than the social picture which Harris presents of\r\nthe state of society here 130 years ago? 'The inhabitants are warm\r\nand well clad at church, fairs, and markets. Tillage and the linen\r\nmanufacture keep them in constant employment; a busy and laborious\r\nlife prevents excess and breaches of the laws, which in no part of\r\nthe kingdom are more reverenced. The people are regular in their\r\nattendance on public worship. Few breaches of the peace, felonies,\r\nburglaries, or murders come before the judges at the assizes;\r\nconvictions for capital offences seldom happen. Men travel securely\r\nby day, and are afraid of little disturbance at night to keep them\r\non their guard. Every man sits down securely under his vine and his\r\nfigtree, and enjoys with comfort the fruit of his honest labours.' He\r\nascribes in the main this prosperity to what he calls '_the spirit of\r\ntillage_.' Until that spirit arose in Ulster, the Irish had to send to\r\nAmerica for their daily bread, 'which,' he says, 'to the astonishment\r\nof all Europe, has been often our weakness.' Viewing the whole social\r\ncondition of the county, he exclaims, 'Such are the happy effects of\r\na well-peopled country, _extensive tillage, the linen manufacture, and\r\nthe Protestant religion_.'\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the present century, the Dublin Society (not yet\r\n'Royal') employed 'land commissioners' to enquire into the condition\r\nof agriculture in the several counties of Ireland. The Rev. John\r\nDubourdieu, rector of Annahilt, in this county, was their commissioner\r\nfor Down and Antrim. He states that the rent was then on an average\r\n20 s. the _Irish_ acre (three equal to five English), allowing for the\r\nmountains and bogs, which he computed at 44,658 acres. The rental of\r\nthe county he sets down at 300,000 l. The net annual value of property\r\nassessed under the Tenement Valuation Act is now 743,869 l. This is\r\nconsiderably under the letting value, it is supposed, 25 per cent. If\r\nthis be so, the county yields to the proprietors a revenue of about\r\n1,000,000 l. a year. If we add the value of the tenant-right, and of\r\nthe fixtures of all sorts--houses, mills, roads, bridges--as well as\r\nthe movable property and stock, we may get some idea of the enormous\r\naggregate of wealth which the labour of man has created on this strip\r\nof wild wooded hills, swampy plains, and bogs.\r\n\r\nNow, what has effected this marvellous change? The tenants, with one\r\nvoice, exclaim, 'our labour, our capital, our skill, our care, and\r\nself-denial. It was we that cleared away the woods which it was\r\nso difficult to eradicate. It was we who drained away the bogs and\r\nmorasses, and by the help of lime and marl converted them into rich\r\nland. It was we that built the dwelling-houses and offices. It was we\r\nthat made the fences, and planted the hedge-rows and orchards. It was\r\nwe that paid for the making of the roads and bridges. The landlords\r\ngave us the wild country to work upon; we have done the rest. Our\r\nindustry enabled them to build their stately mansions, and we have\r\ncontinued to pay to them their princely revenues. Our forefathers\r\ncame with them as settlers, that they might \"plant\" the country with\r\na loyal and industrious race of people, and they came on the assurance\r\nthat they and their children's children were to remain for ever rooted\r\nwhere they were planted. They did their duty faithfully and well by\r\nthe land, by the landlords, and by the Government. Where the children\r\nthat inherited their rights failed, their interest in their farms has\r\nbeen purchased dearly by others of the same race who have taken their\r\nplaces. By what right, then, can they be turned out?'\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, if it were desirable, to introduce the 'high\r\nfarming system' in this county. But if possible, would it be\r\ndesirable? In the eye of a scientific agriculturist it might be better\r\nthat all those comfortable farm-houses, with the innumerable fences\r\ncrossing the landscape in every possible form, making all sorts\r\nof mathematical figures, presenting the appearance of an immense\r\nvariegated patchwork--were levelled and removed so that the plough and\r\nall the modern machinery might range unobstructed over hill and vale.\r\nBut assuredly it would not seem better to the philanthropist, the\r\nChristian, or the statesman. To the chancellor of the exchequer it\r\nwould make the most serious difference; for a few herds and ploughmen\r\nwould consume but a very small portion indeed of the excisable\r\narticles now used by the tenant farmers of this county. I have taken\r\nsome notes on the diet of this people which may be instructive.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century the small farmers were\r\ngenerally weavers. There was an obvious incompatibility in the two\r\noccupations, and the farms were neglected. Gradually this evil has\r\nbeen corrected, especially since the famine. The weavers have\r\nbecome cottiers, and the farmers have devoted themselves to their\r\nagricultural operations exclusively with the more energy since\r\nrailroads have so facilitated the quick sale of produce, particularly\r\nthat sort of produce which enables the occupiers to supply the markets\r\nwith the smaller necessaries of life, and with which large farmers\r\nwould not trouble themselves. Daily labourers working from 6 A.M., to\r\n6 P.M. in large fields with machinery cannot do the hundreds of little\r\nmatters which the family of the small holder attends to every hour of\r\nthe day, often in the night--and which give work to women and children\r\nas well as the men--work of the most healthful character and most free\r\nfrom demoralizing influences.\r\n\r\nOn a farm of fifteen to thirty acres there is constant employment of\r\na profitable kind for the members of a household, including women and\r\nchildren. The effect of good drainage is that farming operations can\r\nbe carried on through winter, in preparing the ground and putting in\r\nwheat and other crops early to supply the markets, when prices are\r\nhigh. Oats, barley, potatoes, flax, turnips claim attention in\r\nturn, and then come the weeding and thinning, the turf-making, the\r\nhay-making, and all the harvest operations. It is by the ceaseless\r\nactivity of small farmers in watching over their pigs, poultry, lambs,\r\n&c., that the markets are kept so regularly supplied, and that towns\r\ngrow up and prosper. If Down and Antrim had been divided into farms\r\nof thousands of acres each, like Lincolnshire, what would Belfast\r\nhave become? Little more than a port for the shipping of live stock\r\nto Liverpool and Glasgow. Before the famine, the food of the small\r\nfarmers was generally potatoes and milk three times a day, with a bit\r\nof meat occasionally. But salt herrings were the main reliance for\r\ngiving a flavour to the potato, often 'wet' and bad. After the failure\r\nof the potatoes, their place was supplied by oatmeal in the form\r\nof 'stirabout.' Indian meal was subsequently found cheaper and more\r\nwholesome. But of late years the diet of the farmers in these parts\r\nhas undergone a complete revolution. There is such brisk demand for\r\nbutter, eggs, potatoes, and other things that used to be consumed\r\nby the family, that they have got into the habit of taking tea, with\r\ncakes and other home-made bread twice, or even three times, a day.\r\nThe demand for tea is, therefore, enormous. There is one grocer's\r\nestablishment in Belfast which has been able to produce a mixture that\r\nsuits the taste of the people, and the quantity of tea sold by it is\r\na ton a day. This is the business of but one out of many houses in\r\nBelfast. Then there is the brisk trade in such towns as Newtownards,\r\nLisburn, Ballymena, &c. In pastoral districts the towns languish, the\r\npeople pine in poverty, and the workhouses are in request.\r\n\r\nIn a financial point of view, therefore, it is manifestly the interest\r\nof the state to encourage 'the spirit of tillage.' It is thus that\r\nmost will be got out of the ground, that most revenue will be raised,\r\nand that the other elements of national power will be most fully\r\ndeveloped. How can this encouragement be most effectually given?\r\nSecurity for the farmer is essential--of what nature should the\r\nsecurity be? The phrase 'unexhausted improvements' is often used.\r\nBut should the legislature contemplate, or make provision for the\r\nexhaustion of improvements? Is the improving tenant to be told that\r\nhis remedy is to retrograde--to undo what he has done--to take out\r\nof the land all the good he has put in it, and reduce it to the\r\ncomparative sterility in which he, or those whom he represents, first\r\nreceived it? Should not the policy of the legislature rather be to\r\nkeep up improvements of the soil, and its productive power at the\r\nhighest possible point, and make it the interest of the occupier\r\nnever to relax in his exertions? The rower will not put forth all his\r\nstrength unless he believes he will win. In other races, though\r\nmany start, only one or two can receive the prize. In this race of\r\nagricultural improvement all competitors might win ample rewards. But\r\nwill they put forth all their energies--is it in human nature that\r\nthey should--was it ever done by any people, if the prizes are to be\r\nseized, enjoyed, and flaunted before their eyes by others, who may\r\nbe strangers, and who never helped them by their sympathy in their\r\ntoilsome course of training and self-denial? It is because the\r\nlandlords of the county Down have been so often in the same boat with\r\ntheir tenants, and with so much good faith, generous feeling, and\r\ncordial sympathy encouraged their exertions, and secured to them their\r\njust rewards, that this great county presents to the world such a\r\nsplendid example of what industry, skill, and capital can accomplish.\r\nIs it not possible to extend the same advantages through the whole\r\nisland without wronging the landlord or degrading the tenant?\r\n\r\nThe stranger is at first surprised to see so large a town as\r\nNewtownards, with its handsome square, its town-hall, its wide,\r\nregular streets, its numerous places of worship, and a population of\r\n9,500, in a place without visible factories, and without communication\r\nwith the sea, within eight miles of Belfast, and three miles of\r\nBangor, which, though a seaport, is but one-fourth of the size. But\r\nalthough there are no great mills sending forth volumes of smoke,\r\nNewtownards is really a manufacturing town. Those clean, regular\r\nstreets, with their two-storey houses, uniform as a district in the\r\neast of London, are inhabited by weavers. In each house there is one\r\nloom at least, in most two or three, and in some as many as six. The\r\nmanufacture of woollen and cotton goods of finer qualities than can\r\nbe produced by the power-loom is carried on extensively. I saw one man\r\nworking at a piece of plaid of six colours, a colour on every shuttle,\r\nWith the help of his wife, who assisted in winding, he was able to\r\nearn only 8 s. a week by very diligent work from early morning till\r\nnight. There is a general complaint of the depression of trade at\r\npresent. Agents, chiefly from Glasgow houses, living in the town,\r\nsupply the yarn and pay the wages. I was struck with the number of\r\npublic-houses in all the leading streets. How far they are supported\r\nby the weavers I cannot say, but whether or not they can dispense\r\nwith the glass, they must have their tobacco, and when this luxury\r\nis deducted, and a shilling a week for the rent of the cottage, it is\r\nhard to understand how a family of six or eight can be supported on\r\nthe weekly wages. The trade of muslin embroidery once flourished here,\r\nand in the pretty little neighbouring town of Comber; but it has so\r\nfallen off that now the best hands, plying the needle unceasingly\r\nduring the long, long day, can earn only three or four shillings\r\na week. Before the invention of machinery for flax-spinning, the\r\nmanufacture of fine thread by hand-labour was a most profitable\r\nemployment. Wonders were wrought in this way by female fingers. The\r\nauthor of 'Our Staple Manufactures' states that in 1799, out of a\r\npound and a half of flax, costing 10 s., a woman produced yarn of the\r\nvalue of 5 l. 2 s. 6 d. Miss M'Quillan, of Comber, spun 94 hanks out\r\nof one pound of flax, splitting the fibre with her needles to give\r\nthis degree of fineness.\r\n\r\n  But alas! what a change to the cottage hearth!\r\n  The song of the wheel's no more--\r\n  The song that gladdened with guileless mirth\r\n  The hearths and homes of the poor!\r\n\r\nBut here, and in all the small towns about, they have still the\r\nweaving, and it is carried on to a considerable extent by persons who\r\nhold a few acres of land, throwing aside the shuttle while putting in\r\nthe crops and doing the harvest work. Thus combining the two pursuits,\r\nthese poor people are able, by extraordinary industry, to earn their\r\ndaily bread; but they can do little more. The weavers, as a class,\r\nappear to be feeble and faded specimens of humanity, remarkably quiet,\r\nintelligent, and well-disposed--a law-abiding people, who shrink from\r\nviolence and outrage, no matter what may be their grievances. It is\r\ncruel to load them too heavily with the burdens of life, and yet I am\r\nafraid it is sometimes done, even in this county, unnecessarily and\r\nwantonly. What I have said of the Downshire and Londonderry estates,\r\nholds good with respect to the estates of the other large proprietors,\r\nsuch as Lord Roden, the kindest of landlords, almost idolised, even by\r\nhis Catholic tenants; Lord Annesley; the trustees of Lord Kilmurray;\r\nSir Thomas Bateson, and others. But I am sorry to learn that even\r\nthe great county Down has a share of the two classes which supply the\r\nworst species of Irish landlords--absentees who live extravagantly in\r\nEngland, and merchants who have purchased estates to make as large a\r\npercentage as possible out of the investment. It is chiefly, but not\r\nwholly, on the estates of these proprietors that cases of injustice\r\nand oppression are found. In the first class it is the agent that the\r\ntenants have to deal with; and whether he be humane or not matters\r\nlittle to them, for, whatever may be his feelings, the utmost penny\r\nmust be exacted to keep up the expensive establishments of the\r\nlandlord in England, to meet the cost of a new building, or the debt\r\nincurred by gambling on the turf and elsewhere. Every transaction of\r\nthe kind brings a fresh demand on the agent, and even if he be not\r\nunscrupulous or cruel, he must put on the screw, and get the money\r\nat all hazards. I have been assured that it is quite usual, on such\r\nestates, to find the tenantry paying the highest rent compatible with\r\nthe maintenance of bare life. There is in the county of Down a great\r\nnumber of small holders thus struggling for existence. As a specimen\r\nlet us take the following case:--A man holds a dozen acres of land,\r\nfor which he pays 2 l. 10 s. per acre. He labours as no slave could be\r\nmade to work, in the summer time from five o'clock in the morning till\r\nsix in the evening. He can hardly scrape together a pound beyond the\r\nrent and taxes. If a bad season comes, he is at starvation point: he\r\nfalls into arrears with the landlord, and he is forced by the bailiff\r\nto sell off his small stock to pay the rent.\r\n\r\nWithout the excuse of pecuniary difficulties, the merchant landlord is\r\nnot a whit less exacting, or more merciful. He looks upon the tenants\r\nas he would on so many head of cattle, and his sole consideration\r\nis what is the highest penny he can make out of them. Not far from\r\nBelfast lived a farmer who cultivated a few acres. Sickness and the\r\nsupport of a widowed sister's family forced him into arrears of rent.\r\nEjectment proceedings were taken, and one day when he returned to his\r\nhouse, he found his furniture thrown out on the road, the sister and\r\nfamily evicted, and the door locked. He was offered as much money as\r\nwould take him to America, but he would not be allowed to sell the\r\ntenant-right. Here is another case illustrative of the manner in which\r\nthat right is sometimes dealt with:--A respectable man purchased a\r\nfarm at 10 l. an acre. It was very poor land, much of it unfit for\r\ncultivation. Immediately on getting possession a surveyor came and\r\nadded two acres to the former measurement. The incoming tenant was\r\nat the same time informed that the rent was raised to an extent that\r\ncaused the possession to be a dead loss. On threatening to throw up\r\nthe concern, some reduction was made, which brought the rent as close\r\nas possible to the full letting value.\r\n\r\nI have been told by a well-informed gentleman, whose veracity I cannot\r\ndoubt, that it is quite common in the county of Down (and indeed\r\nI have been told the same thing in other counties) to find an\r\n_improving_ tenant paying 2 l. to 3 l. an acre for land, which he has\r\nat his own expense brought up to a good state of cultivation,\r\nwhile the adjoining land of his lazy neighbour--originally of equal\r\nvalue--yields only 20 s. to 35 s. an acre. The obvious tendency of\r\nthis unjust and impolitic course on the part of landlords and agents,\r\nis to discourage improvements, to dishearten the industrious, and to\r\nfill the country with thriftless, desponding, and miserable occupiers,\r\nliving from hand to mouth. There are circumstances under which even\r\nselfish men will toil hard, though others should share with them the\r\nbenefit of their labours; but if they feel that this partnership in\r\nthe profits of their industry is the result of a system of legalised\r\ninjustice, which enables unscrupulous men to appropriate at will the\r\nwhole of the profits, their moral sense so revolts against that system\r\nthat they resolve to do as little as they possibly can.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these painful relations of landlord and tenant,\r\neven in this comparatively happy county, is a perceptible degeneracy\r\nin the manhood of the people. Talk to an old inhabitant, who has been\r\nan attentive observer of his times, and he will tell you that\r\nthe vigorous and energetic, the intelligent and enterprising, are\r\ndeparting to more favoured lands, and that this process has produced\r\na marked deterioration in the population within his memory. He can\r\ndistinctly recollect when there were more than double the present\r\nnumber of strong farmers in the country about Belfast. He declares\r\nthat, with many exceptions of course, the land is getting into the\r\nhands of a second or third class of farmers, who are little more than\r\nservants to the small landlords. Even where there are leases, such\r\nintelligent observers affirm that they are so over-ridden with\r\nconditions that the farmer has no liberty or security to make any\r\ngreat improvements. Were it otherwise he would not think a thirty-one\r\nyears' lease sufficient for the building of a stone house, that would\r\nbe as good at the end of a hundred years as at the end of thirty. All\r\nthe information that I can gather from thoughtful men, who are really\r\nanxious for a change that would benefit the landlords as well as\r\nthemselves, points to the remedy which Lord Granard has suggested,\r\nas the most simple, feasible, and satisfactory--the legalisation and\r\nextension of the tenant-right custom. They rejoice that such landlords\r\nnow proclaim the injustice which the tenant class have so long\r\nbitterly felt--namely, the presumption of law that all the\r\nimprovements and buildings on the farm belong to the lord of the\r\nsoil, although the notorious fact is that they are all the work of the\r\ntenant.\r\n\r\nAnd here I will take the opportunity of remarking that the legislature\r\nwere guilty of strange oversight, or deliberate injustice, in\r\nthe passing of the Incumbered Estates Act. Taking advantage of an\r\noverwhelming national calamity, they forced numbers of gentlemen into\r\na ruinous sale of their patrimonial estates, in order that men of\r\ncapital might get possession of them. But they made no provision\r\nwhatever for the protection of the tenants, or of the property which\r\nthose tenants had created on these estates. Many of those were tenants\r\nat will, who built and planted in perfect and well-grounded reliance\r\non the honour and integrity of their old landlords. But in the\r\nadvertisements for the sale of property under the Landed Estates\r\nCourt, it was regularly mentioned as an inducement to purchasers of\r\nthe Scully type that the tenants had no leases. The result of this\r\ncombination of circumstances bearing against the cultivators of the\r\nsoil--the chief producers of national wealth--is a deep, resentful\r\nsense of injustice pervading this class, and having for its immediate\r\nobjects the landlords and their agents. The tenants don't speak out\r\ntheir feelings, because they dare not. They fear that to offend the\r\n_office_ in word or deed is to expose themselves and their children\r\nto the infliction of a fine in the shape of increased rent, perhaps at\r\nthe rate of five or ten shillings an acre in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate effect of the distrust thus generated, is that when\r\nenlightened landlords, full of the spirit of improvement, like Lord\r\nDufferin and Lord Lurgan, endeavour, from the most unselfish and\r\npatriotic motives, to make changes in the tenures and customs on their\r\nestates, they have to encounter an adverse current of popular opinion\r\nand feeling, which is really too strong to be effectually resisted.\r\nFor example: In order to correct the evils resulting from the undue\r\ncompetition for land among the tenants, they limit the amount per acre\r\nwhich the outgoing tenant is permitted to receive; but the limitation\r\nis futile, because the tenants understand one another, and do what\r\nthey believe to be right behind the landlord's back. The market price\r\nis, say, 20 l. an acre. The landlord allows 10 l.; the balance finds\r\nits way secretly into the pocket of the outgoing tenant before he\r\ngives up possession. As a gentleman expressed it to me emphatically,\r\n'The outgoing tenant _must_ be satisfied, and he _is_ satisfied.'\r\nPublic opinion in his own class demands it; and on no other terms\r\nwould it be considered lucky to take possession of the vacant farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTENANT-RIGHT IN ANTRIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find from the Antrim Survey, published in 1812, that at that time\r\nleases were general on the Hertfort estate. There were then about\r\n3,600 farmers who held by that tenure, each holding, on an average,\r\ntwenty English acres, but many farms contained 100 acres or more. Mr.\r\nHugh M'Call, of Lisburn, the able author of 'Our Staple Manufactures,'\r\ngives the following estimates of the rental. In 1726, it was 3,500\r\nl.; in 1768, it was 12,000 l.; and for 1869, his estimate is 63,000 l.\r\nTaking the estimate given by Dean Stannus, as 10 l. or 12 l. an acre,\r\nthe tenant-right of the estate is worth 500,000 l. at the very least,\r\nprobably 600,000 l. is the more correct figure. This vast amount of\r\nproperty created by the industry and capital of the tenants, is held\r\nat the will of an absentee landlord, who has on several occasions\r\nbetrayed an utter want of sympathy with the people who lie thus at his\r\nmercy. There are tenant farmers on the estate who hold as much as\r\n100 to 200 acres, with handsome houses built by themselves, whose\r\ninterest, under the custom, should amount to 1,500 l. and 2,500 l.\r\nrespectively, which might be legally swept away by a six months'\r\nnotice to quit. The owners of this property might be regarded as very\r\nindependent, but in reality, unless the spirit of martyrdom has raised\r\nthem above the ordinary feelings of human nature, they will take care\r\nto be very humble and submissive towards Lord Hertfort's agents. If\r\nwords were the same as deeds, if professions were always consistent\r\nwith practice, the tenants would certainly have nothing to fear; for\r\ngreat pains have been taken from time to time, both by the landlord\r\nand agent, to inspire them with unbounded confidence.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1845, the tenants presented an address to Lord Hertfort,\r\nin which they said:--'It is a proud fact, worthy to be recorded, that\r\nthe tenant-right of the honest and industrious man on your lordship's\r\nestate is a certain and valuable tenure to him, so long as he\r\ncontinues to pay his rent.' To this his lordship replied in the\r\nfollowing terms:--'I am happy to find that the encouragement I\r\nhave given to the improvement of the land generally has been found\r\neffectual, and I trust that the advantage to the tenant of the\r\nimproved system of agriculture will be found to increase; and I beg\r\nto assure you that with me the right of the improving tenant shall\r\ncontinue to be as scrupulously respected as it has been hitherto by\r\nmy ancestors. Your kindness alone, independent of the natural\r\ninterest which I must ever feel as to everything connected with this\r\nneighbourhood, affords a powerful inducement to my coming among you,\r\nand I hope to have the pleasure of often repeating my visit.'\r\n\r\nTwenty-four years have since elapsed, and during all that time the\r\nmarquis has never indulged himself in a repetition of the exquisite\r\npleasure he then enjoyed. At a banquet given in his honour on that\r\noccasion, he used the following language, which was, no doubt,\r\npublished in the _Times_, and read with great interest in London and\r\nParis:--'This is one of the most delightful days I ever spent. Trust\r\nme, I have your happiness and welfare at heart, and it shall ever\r\nbe my endeavour to promote the one and contribute to the other.' The\r\nparting scene on this occasion must have been very touching; for,\r\nin tearing himself away, his lordship said: 'I have now come to the\r\nconcluding toast. It is, \"Merry have we met, and merry may we _soon_\r\nmeet again!\"'\r\n\r\nThe tenants could scarcely doubt the genuineness of their landlord's\r\nfeelings, for on the same occasion Dean Stannus said: 'I feel myself\r\nperfectly justified in using the term \"a good landlord;\" because his\r\nlordship's express wish to me often was, \"I hope you will always\r\nkeep me in such a position that I may be considered the friend of\r\nmy tenants.\"' But as he did not return to them, a most respectable\r\ndeputation waited upon him in London in the year 1850, to present\r\na memorial praying for a reduction of rent on account of the potato\r\nblight and other local calamities which had befallen the tenantry. The\r\nmemorialists respectfully showed 'that under the encouraging auspices\r\nof the Hertfort family, and on the faith of that just and equitable\r\nunderstanding which has always existed on this estate--that _no\r\nadvantage would be taken of the tenant's improvements in adjusting\r\nthe letting value of land_, they had invested large sums of money in\r\nbuildings and other improvements on their farms, and that this, under\r\nthe name of tenant-right, was a species of sunk capital that was\r\nformerly considered a safe repository for accumulated savings, which\r\ncould be turned to account at any time of difficulty by its sale, or\r\nas a security for temporary advances.' In his reply, Lord Hertfort\r\nsaid, 'I seek not to disturb any interest, much less do I wish to\r\ninterfere by any plan or arrangement of mine with the tenant-right\r\nwhich my tenants have hitherto enjoyed, and which it is my anxious\r\nwish to preserve to them.'\r\n\r\nThe faith and hope inspired by these assurances of the landlord were\r\nrepeatedly encouraged and strengthened by the public declarations of\r\nhis very reverend agent, Dean Stannus. At a meeting of the Killultagh\r\nand Derryvolgie Farming Society, in 1849, he stated that he had great\r\npleasure in subscribing to almost everything said by Mr. M'Call.\r\nHe had taken great pains to convince the late Lord Hertfort that\r\ntenant-right was one of the greatest possible boons, _as well to the\r\nlandlords themselves_ as to the tenants. So advantageous did he regard\r\nit to the interest of Lord Hertfort and the tenants, that if it were\r\nnot preserved he would not continue agent to the estate. Tenant-right\r\nwas his security for the Marquis of Hertfort's rent, and he would not\r\nask a tenant to relinquish a single rood of land without paying him at\r\nthe rate of 10 l. to 12 l. an acre for it.\r\n\r\nFirmly believing in the statements thus emphatically and solemnly made\r\nto them from time to time, that on this estate tenant-right was as\r\ngood as a lease, the tenants went on building houses, and making\r\npermanent improvements in Lisburn and elsewhere, depending on this\r\nsecurity. And, indeed, the value of such security could scarcely be\r\npresented under more favourable circumstances. The absentee landlord\r\nreceiving such a princely revenue, and absorbed in his Parisian\r\npursuits, seemed to leave everything to his agent. The agent was\r\nrector of the parish of Lisburn, a dignitary of the Church, a\r\ngentleman of the highest social position, with many excellent points\r\nin his character, and pledged before the world, again and again,\r\nto respect rigidly and scrupulously the enormous property which\r\na confiding tenantry had invested in this estate. If, under these\r\ncircumstances, the security of tenant-right fails, where else can it\r\nbe trusted? If it be proved, by open and public proceedings, that on\r\nthe Hertfort estate, the distinctly recognised property of the tenant\r\nis liable to be seized and wrested from him by the agent, it is clear\r\nto demonstration that such property absolutely requires the protection\r\nof law. This proof, I am sorry to say, is forthcoming. Let my readers\r\nreflect for a moment on what might have been done for Lisburn and the\r\nsurrounding country if the Marquis of Hertfort had rebuilt his castle\r\nand resided among his people. What an impulse to improvement of every\r\nkind, what employment for tradesmen of every class, what business for\r\nshops might have resulted from the local expenditure of 50,000 l. or\r\n60,000 l. a year! What public buildings would have been erected--how\r\nlocal institutions would have flourished! The proverb that 'absence\r\nmakes the heart grow fonder' does not apply to the relations of\r\nlandlord and tenant. But there is another proverb that applies\r\nwell--'Out of sight, out of mind.' Of this I shall now give two or\r\nthree illustrations. Some years ago, it was discovered that no\r\nlease of the Catholic chapel at Lisburn could be found, and in the\r\nrecollection of the oldest member of the congregation no rent had been\r\npaid. Kent, however, was now demanded, and the parish priest agreed\r\nto pay a nominal amount, which places the congregation at the mercy\r\nof the office. Ground was asked some time ago to build a Presbyterian\r\nChurch, but it was absolutely refused. A sum of money was subscribed\r\nto build a literary institute, but, though a sort of promise was given\r\nfor ground to build it on, it was never granted, and the project fell\r\nthrough. Lord Hertfort spends no portion of his vast income where it\r\nis earned. His estate is like a farm to which the produce is never\r\nreturned in the shape of manure, but is all carted off and applied to\r\nthe enrichment of a farm elsewhere. One might suppose that where such\r\nan exhausting process has been going on for so long a time an effort\r\nwould be made at some sort of compensation, especially at periods of\r\ncalamity. Yet, when the weavers on his estate were starving, owing to\r\nthe cotton famine during the American war, his lordship never replied\r\nto the repeated applications made to him for help to save alive those\r\nhonest producers of his wealth. The noble example of Lord Derby and\r\nother proprietors in Lancashire failed to kindle in his heart a spark\r\nof humanity, not to speak of generous emulation. The sum of 3,000 l.\r\nwas raised in Lisburn, and by friends in Great Britain and America,\r\nwhich was expended in saving the people from going _en masse_ to\r\nthe workhouse. Behold a contrast! While the great peer, whose family\r\ninherited a vast estate for which they never paid a shilling, was deaf\r\nto the cries of famishing Christians, whom he was bound by every tie\r\nto commiserate and relieve, an American citizen, who owed nothing\r\nto Ireland but his birth--Mr. A.T. Stewart, of New York--sent a ship\r\nloaded with provisions, which cost him 5,000 l. of his own money, to\r\nbe distributed amongst Lord Hertfort's starving tenants, and on\r\nthe return of the ship he took out as many emigrants as he could\r\naccommodate, free of charge. The tourist in Ireland is charmed with\r\nthe appearance of Lisburn--the rich and nicely cultivated town parks,\r\nthe fields white as snow with linen of the finest quality, the busy\r\nmills, the old trees, the clean streets, the look of comfort in the\r\npopulation, the pretty villas in the country about. Mrs. S.C. Hall\r\nsays that there is, probably, no town in Ireland where the happy\r\neffects of English taste and industry are more conspicuous than at\r\nLisburn. 'From Drumbridge and the banks of the Lagan on one side,\r\nto the shores of Lough Neagh on the other, the people are almost\r\nexclusively the descendants of English settlers. Those in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the town were mostly Welsh, but great\r\nnumbers arrived from the northern English shires, and from the\r\nneighbourhood of the Bristol Channel. The English language is perhaps\r\nspoken more purely by the populace of this district than by the same\r\nclass in any other part of Ireland. The neatness of the cottages, and\r\nthe good taste displayed in many of the farms, are little, if at all,\r\ninferior to aught that we find in England, and the tourist who visits\r\nLough Neagh, passing through Ballinderry, will consider it to have\r\nbeen justly designated _the garden of the north._ The multitude of\r\npretty little villages, scattered over the landscape, each announcing\r\nitself by the tapering tower of a church, would almost beguile the\r\ntraveller into believing that he was passing through a rural district\r\nin one of the midland counties of England.'\r\n\r\nWe have seen that after General Conway got this land, it was described\r\nby an English traveller as still uninhabited--'all woods and moor.'\r\nWho made it the garden of the north? The British settlers and their\r\ndescendants. And why did they transform this wilderness into fruitful\r\nfields? Because they had permanent tenures and fair rents. The rental\r\n150 years ago was 3,500 l. per annum. Allow that money was three times\r\nas valuable then as it is now, and the rental would have been about\r\n10,500 l. It is now nearly six times that amount. By what means was\r\nthe revenue of the landlord increased? Was it by any expenditure of\r\nhis own? Did any portion of the capital annually abstracted from\r\nthe estate return to it, to fructify and increase its value? Did the\r\nlandlord drain the swamps, reclaim the moors, build the dwellings and\r\nfarmhouses, make the fences, and plant the orchards? He did nothing\r\nof the kind. Nor was it agricultural industry alone that increased his\r\nrevenue. He owes much of the beauty, fertility, and richness of his\r\nestate to the linen manufacture, to those weavers to the cries of\r\ndistress from whose famishing children a few years ago the most noble\r\nmarquis resolutely turned a deaf ear.\r\n\r\nBut, passing from historical matters to the immediate purpose of our\r\nenquiry, let it suffice to remark that from Lisburn as a centre the\r\nlinen trade in all its branches--flax growing, scutching, spinning,\r\nweaving and bleaching--spread over the whole of the Hertfort estate,\r\ngiving profitable employment to the tenants, circulating money,\r\nenabling them to build and improve and work the estate into the\r\nrich and beautiful garden described by Mrs. Hall;--all this work\r\nof improvement has been carried on, all or nearly all the costly\r\ninvestments on the land have been made, without leases and in\r\ndependence on tenant-right. We have seen what efforts were made by\r\nlandlord and agent to strengthen the faith of the tenants in this\r\nsecurity. We have seen also from the historical facts I have adduced\r\nthe sort of people that constitute the population of the borough of\r\nLisburn. If ever there was a population that could be safely entrusted\r\nwith the free exercise of the franchise it is the population of\r\nthis town--so enlightened, so loyal, so independent in means, such\r\nadmirable producers of national wealth, so naturally attached to\r\nBritish connection. Yet for generations Lisburn has been a pocket\r\nborough, and the nominee of the landlord, often a total stranger, was\r\nreturned as a matter of course. The marquis sent to his agent a _congé\r\nd'élire_, and that was as imperative as a similar order to a dean\r\nand chapter to elect a bishop. In 1852 the gentleman whom the Lisburn\r\nelectors were ordered to return was Mr. Inglis, the lord advocate of\r\nScotland. They, however, felt that the time was come when the borough\r\nshould be opened, and they should be at liberty to exercise their\r\nconstitutional rights. A meeting of the inhabitants was therefore\r\nheld, at which Mr. R. Smith was nominated as the popular candidate.\r\nThe contest was not political; it was simply the independence of the\r\nborough against the _office_. Dean Stannus, as agent to an absentee\r\nlandlord, was the most powerful personage in the place, virtually\r\nthe lord of the manor. Before the election that gentleman published a\r\nletter in a Belfast paper contradicting a statement that had\r\nappeared to the effect that Lord Hertfort took little interest in the\r\napproaching contest, in which letter he said: 'I have the best reason\r\nfor knowing that his lordship views with intense interest what is\r\npassing here, and that he is most anxious for the return of Mr.\r\nInglis, feeling that the election of such a representative (which I am\r\nnow enabled to say is _certain_) will do much credit to the borough of\r\nLisburn, and that this _unmeaning_ contest will, at all events, among\r\nits other effects, prove to his lordship whom he may regard as his\r\n_true_ friends in his future relations with this town.'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this warning, so significantly emphasized, the\r\ncandidate whom the voters selected as their real representative was\r\nreturned. Now no one can blame the marquis or his agent for wishing\r\nthat the choice had fallen upon Mr. Inglis. So far as politics were\r\nconcerned, the contest _was_ unmeaning; but so far as the rights of\r\nthe people and the loyal working of the British constitution were\r\nconcerned, the contest was full of meaning, and if the landlord and\r\nhis agent respected the constitution more than their own personal\r\npower they would have frankly acquiesced in the result, feeling that\r\nthis Protestant and Conservative constituency had conscientiously\r\ndone its duty to the state. But who could have imagined, after all\r\nthe solemnly recorded pledges I have quoted, that they would have\r\ninstantly resolved to punish the independent exercise of the franchise\r\nby inflicting an enormous and crushing fine amounting to nothing less\r\nthan the whole tenant-right property of every adverse voter who had\r\nnot a lease! Immediately after the election 'notices to quit' were\r\nserved upon every one of them. In consequence of this outrageous\r\nproceeding a public meeting was held, at which a letter from John\r\nMillar, Esq., a most respectable and wealthy man (who was unable to\r\nattend) was read by the secretary. He said: 'I have at various times\r\npurchased places held from year to year, relying on the custom of the\r\ncountry, and on the declared determination of the landlord and his\r\nagent to respect such customary rights of property, for the continued\r\npossession of it. I have besides taken under the same landlord several\r\nfields as town parks, which were in very bad order. These fields I\r\nhave drained and very much improved. I have always punctually paid the\r\nrent charged for the several holdings, and, I think I may venture to\r\nsay, performed all the duties of a good tenant. At the last election,\r\nhowever, I exercised my right as a citizen of a free country,\r\nby giving my votes at Hillsborough and Lisburn in favour of the\r\ntenant-right candidates, without reference to the desires or orders of\r\nthose who have no legal or constitutional right to control the use of\r\nmy franchise. I have since received from the office a notice to quit,\r\ndesiring me to give up possession of all my holdings, as tenant\r\nfrom year to year, in the counties of Down and Antrim, without any\r\nintimation that I shall receive compensation, and without being able\r\nto obtain any explanation of this conduct towards me except by popular\r\nrumour.' At the same meeting Mr. Hugh M'Call said that he had looked\r\nover some documents and found that the individuals in Lisburn who\r\nhad received notices to quit held property to the value of 3,000 l.,\r\nproperty raised by themselves, or purchased by them with the sanction\r\nof the landlord. In one case the agent himself went into the premises\r\nwhere buildings were being erected, and suggested some changes. In\r\nfact the improvements were carried out under his inspection as an\r\narchitect. Yet he served upon that gentleman a notice to quit. Some\r\nof the tenants paid the penalty for their votes by surrendering their\r\nholdings; others contested the right of eviction on technical points,\r\nand succeeded at the quarter sessions. One of the points was, as\r\nalready mentioned, that a dean and rector could not be legally a land\r\nagent at the same time. It was, indeed, a very ugly fact that the\r\nrector of the parish should be thus officially engaged, not only in\r\nnullifying the political rights of his own Protestant parishioners,\r\nbut in destroying their tenant-right, evicting them from their\r\nholdings, which _they_ believed to be legal robbery and oppression,\r\naccompanied by such flagrant breach of faith as tended to destroy all\r\nconfidence between man and man, and thus to dissolve the strongest\r\nbonds of society. Sad work for a dignitary of the church to be engaged\r\nin!\r\n\r\nIn April, 1856, there was another contested election. On that\r\noccasion the marquis wrote to a gentleman in Lisburn that he would not\r\ninterfere 'directly or indirectly to influence anybody.' Nevertheless,\r\nnotices to quit, signed by Mr. Walter L. Stannus, assistant and\r\nsuccessor to his father, were extensively served upon tenants-at-will,\r\nthough it was afterwards alleged that they were only served as matters\r\nof form. But what, then, did they mean? They meant that those who\r\nhad voted against the office had, _ipso facto, forfeited their\r\ntenant-right property._ Many other incidents in the management of the\r\nestate have been constantly occurring more recently, tending to show\r\nthat the most valuable properties created by the tenants-at-will are\r\nat the mercy of the landlord, and that tenant-right, so called, is\r\nnot regarded by him as a matter of _right_ at all, but merely as a\r\n_favour_, to be granted to those who are dutiful and submissive to the\r\noffice in all matters, political and social. For instance, one farmer\r\nwas refused permission to sell his tenant-right till he consented to\r\nsink 100 l. or 200 l. in the shares of the Lisburn and Antrim railway,\r\nso that, as he believed, he was obliged to throw away his money in\r\norder to get his right.\r\n\r\nThe enormous power of an office which can deal with property amounting\r\nto more than half a million sterling, in such an arbitrary manner,\r\nnecessarily generates a spirit of wanton and capricious despotism,\r\nexcept where the mind is very well regulated and the heart severely\r\ndisciplined by Christian duty. Of this I feel bound to give the\r\nfollowing illustration, which I would not do if the fact had not been\r\nmade public, and if I had not the best evidence that it is undeniable.\r\nGeorge Beattie, jun., a grocer's assistant in Lisburn, possessed a\r\nbeautiful greyhound which he left in charge of George Beattie, sen.,\r\nhis uncle, on departing for America. This uncle possessed a farm on\r\nthe Hertfort estate, the tenant-right of which he wanted to sell.\r\nHaving applied to Mr. Stannus for permission, the answer he received\r\nwas that he would not be allowed to sell until the head of the\r\ngreyhound was brought to the office. The tenant remonstrated and\r\noffered to send the dog away off the estate to relatives, but to no\r\neffect. He was obliged to kill the greyhound, and to send its head in\r\na bag to Lord Hertfort's office. It was a great triumph for the agent.\r\nWhat a pretty sensational story he had to tell the young ladies in the\r\nrefined circles in which he moves. How edifying the recital must have\r\nbeen to the peasantry around him! How it must have exalted their ideas\r\nof the civilising influence of land agency. 'It is quite a common\r\nthing,' says a gentleman well acquainted with the estate, 'when a\r\ntenant becomes insolvent, that his tenant-right is sold and employed\r\nto pay those of his creditors who may be in favour. I know a lady who\r\nmade application to have a claim against a small farmer registered in\r\nthe office, which was done, and she now possesses the security of the\r\nman's tenant-right for her money.'\r\n\r\nThe case of the late Captain Bolton is the last illustration I\r\nshall give in connection with this estate. Captain Bolton resided in\r\nLisburn, and he was one of the most respected of its inhabitants.\r\nHe was the owner of four houses in that town, a property which he\r\nacquired in this way:--The site of two of them was obtained by the\r\nlate James Hogg, in lieu of freehold property surrendered. On this\r\nground, his son, Captain Bolton's uncle, built the two houses entirely\r\nat his own expense. Two other houses, immediately adjoining, came into\r\nthe market, and he purchased the out-going tenant's 'good-will' for\r\na sum of about 40 l. These houses were thatched, and in very bad\r\ncondition. He repaired them and slated them, and thus formed a nice\r\nuniform block of four workers' houses. Captain Bolton inherited these\r\nfrom his uncle and retained uninterrupted possession till 1852, when\r\nhe voted for Johnston Smyth at the election of that date. Immediately\r\nafterwards he received a notice to quit, an ejectment was brought in\r\ndue time, the case was dismissed at the quarter sessions, an appeal\r\nwas lodged, but it was again dismissed at the assizes. Undaunted by\r\nthese two defeats, the persistent agent served another notice to quit.\r\nThe captain was a man of peace, whose nerves could not stand such\r\nperpetual worrying by litigation, and he was so disgusted with\r\nthe whole affair that he tied up the keys, and sent them to Lord\r\nHertfort's office. In his ledger that day he made the following\r\nentry:--'Plundered, this 20th December 1854, by our worthy agent to\r\nthe marquis, because I voted for Smyth and the independence of the\r\nborough.--J.B.'\r\n\r\nThe houses remained in the hands of the agent till the next election,\r\nwhen Captain Bolton voted for Mr. Hogg, the office candidate.\r\nThe conscientious old gentleman--as good a conservative as Dean\r\nStannus--voted from principle in both cases and not to please the\r\nagent or anyone else. The agent, however, thought proper to regard\r\nit as a penitent act, and as the tenant had ceased to be naughty,\r\nand had, it was assumed, shown proper deference to his political\r\nsuperiors, he received his houses back again, retaining the possession\r\nof them till his death. The profit rent of the houses is 20 l. a year.\r\nEither this rent belonged to Captain Bolton or to Lord Hertfort. If\r\nto Captain Bolton, by what right did Dean Stannus take it from him and\r\ngive it to the landlord? If to the landlord, by what right did Dean\r\nStannus take it from Lord Hertfort and give it to Captain Bolton?\r\n\r\nHowever, the latter gentleman having no doubt whatever, first or last,\r\nthat the property was his own, bequeathed the houses to trustees\r\nfor the support of a school which he had established in Lisburn. The\r\nschool, it appears, had been placed in connection with the Church\r\nEducation Society, and as it did not go on to his satisfaction, he\r\nplaced it in connection with the National Board of Education, having\r\nappointed as his trustees John Campbell, Esq., M.D., William Coulson,\r\nEsq., and the Rev. W.J. Clarke, Presbyterian minister, all of Lisburn.\r\nDr. Campbell died soon after, and Mr. Coulson refused to act, so that\r\nthe burden of the trust fell upon Mr. Clarke, who felt it to be\r\nhis duty to carry it out to the best of his ability. Dean Stannus,\r\nhowever, was greatly dissatisfied with the last will and testament of\r\nCaptain Bolton. Yet the dying man had no reason to anticipate that\r\nhis affectionate pastor would labour with all his might to abolish\r\nthe trust. Dean Stannus paid the captain a visit on his deathbed, and\r\nwhile administering the consolations of religion he seemed moved\r\neven to tears. To a friend who subsequently expressed doubt, the\r\nsimple-minded old Christian said: 'I will trust the dean that he will\r\ndo nothing in opposition to my will. He was here a few days ago and\r\nwept over me. He loves me, and will carry out my wishes.' The captain\r\ndied in April, 1867. He was scarcely cold in his grave when the agent\r\nof Lord Hertfort took proceedings to eject his trustees, and deprive\r\nthe schools of the property bequeathed for their support. Not content\r\nwith this, he took proceedings to get possession of the schoolhouse\r\nalso, deeming it a sufficient reason for this appropriation of another\r\nman's property, this setting aside of a will, this abolition of\r\na trust, that, in his opinion, the schools ought to be under the\r\npatronage of the rector, and in connection with the Church Education\r\nSociety. He had a perfect right to think and say this, and it might\r\nbe his conscientious conviction that the property would be thus better\r\nemployed; but he ought to know that the end does not sanctify the\r\nmeans; that he had no right to substitute his own will for that of\r\nCaptain Bolton, and that he had no right to take advantage of the\r\nabsence of an act of parliament to possess himself of the rightful\r\nproperty of other people. Unfortunately, too, he was a judge in his\r\nown case, and he did not find it easy to separate the rector of the\r\nparish from the agent of the estate. It is a significant fact that\r\nwhen his son, Mr. Stannus, handed his power of attorney to Mr. Otway,\r\nthe assistant-barrister, that gentleman refused to look at it, saying,\r\n'I have seen it one hundred times;' and the Rev. Mr. Clarke, while\r\nwaiting in the court for the case to come on, observed that all the\r\nejectment processes were at the suit of the Marquis of Hertfort. The\r\nschool-house was built by Mr. Bolton, at his own expense twenty-eight\r\nyears ago, and he maintained it till his death. The Rev. W.J. Clarke,\r\nthe acting trustee, bravely defended his trust and fought the battle\r\nof tenant-right in the courts till driven out by the sheriff. He\r\nwas then called on to perform the same duty with regard to the\r\nschool-house. He has done it faithfully and well, and deserves the\r\nsympathy of all the friends of freedom, justice, and fair dealing.\r\n'I shall never accept a trust,' he says, in a letter to the _Northern\r\nWhig_--'I shall never accept a trust, and permit any man, whether\r\nnobleman, agent, or bailiff, to alienate that trust, without appealing\r\nto the laws of my country; and if the one-sidedness of such laws shall\r\nenable Dean and Mr. Stannus to confiscate this property, and turn\r\nit from the purpose to which benevolence designed it, then, having\r\ndefended it to the last, I shall retire from the field satisfied that\r\nI have done my duty to the memory of the dead and the educational\r\ninterests of the living.' Nor can we be surprised at the strong\r\nlanguage that he uses when he says: 'The history of the case rivals,\r\nfor blackness of persecution, anything that has happened in the north\r\nof Ireland for many years. But such a course of conduct only recoils\r\non the heads of those who are guilty of it, and it shall be so in this\r\ncase. The Marquis of Hertfort will not live always, and the power of\r\npublic opinion may be able to reach his successor, and be felt even in\r\nLisburn.'\r\n\r\nDean Stannus, in his evidence before the Devon commission, stated that\r\nonly a small portion of the estate was held by lease. The leases were\r\nobtained in a curious way. In 1823 a system of fining commenced. If a\r\ntenant wanted a lease he was required to pay in cash a fine of 10 l.\r\nan acre, which was equal to an addition of ten shillings an acre to\r\nthe rent for twenty years, not counting the interest on the money thus\r\nsunk in the land. Yet, such was the desire of the tenants to have a\r\nbetter security than the tenant-right custom, always acknowledged on\r\nthe estate, that 'every man who had money took advantage of it.' Mr.\r\nGregg, the seneschal of the manor, gave an illustration of the working\r\nof this fining system. A tenant sold his farm of fourteen acres for\r\n205 l., eight of the fourteen acres being held at will. The person who\r\nbought the farm was obliged to take a lease of the eight acres, and\r\nto pay a proportional fine in addition to the sum paid for the\r\ntenant-right. Dean Stannus said 'he would wish to see the tenant-right\r\nupheld upon the estate of Lord Hertfort, as it always had been. It is\r\nthat,' he said, 'which has kept up the properties in the north over\r\nthe properties in other parts of Ireland. It is a security for the\r\nrent in the first instance, and reconciles the tenants to much of what\r\nare called grievances. If you go into a minute calculation of\r\nwhat they have expended, they are not more than paid for their\r\nexpenditure.' It transpired in the course of the examination that a\r\nman who had purchased tenant-right, and paid a fine of 10 l. an acre\r\non getting a lease, would have to pay a similar fine over again when\r\ngetting the lease renewed. The result of these heavy advances was that\r\nthe middle-class farmers lived in constant pecuniary difficulties.\r\nThey were obliged to borrow money at six per cent. to pay the rent,\r\nbut they borrowed it under circumstances which made it nearly 40 per\r\ncent., for it was lent by dealers in oatmeal and other things, from\r\nwhom they were obliged to purchase large quantities of goods at such a\r\nhigh rate that they sold them again at a sacrifice of 33 per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Joshua Lamb, another witness, stated that the effect of the fining\r\nsystem had been to draw away a great deal of the accumulated capital\r\nout of the hands of the tenantry, as well as their anticipated savings\r\nfor years to come, by which the carrying out of improved methods of\r\nagriculture was prevented. Still, the existence of a lease for 31\r\nyears doubled the value of the tenant-right. This witness made a\r\nremarkable statement. With respect to this custom he said: The 'effect\r\nof this arrangement, when duly observed, is to prevent all disputes,\r\nquarrels, burnings, and destruction of property, so common in those\r\nparts of Ireland where this practice does not prevail. Indeed, so\r\nfully are farmers aware of this, that very few, except the most\r\nreckless, would venture on taking a farm without obtaining the\r\noutgoing tenant's \"good-will.\" Such a proceeding as taking land\r\n\"over a man's head,\" as it is termed, is regarded here as not merely\r\ndishonourable, but as little better than robbery, and as such held\r\nin the greatest detestation.' He added that the justice of this\r\narrangement was obvious--'because all the buildings, planting, and\r\nother improvements, being entirely at the tenant's expense, he has a\r\ncertain amount of capital sunk in the property, for which, if he\r\nparts with the place, he expects to be repaid by the sale of the\r\ntenant-right. He knew no case in the county in which the tenant, or\r\nthose from whom he purchased, had made no improvements.'\r\n\r\nThe first marquis occasionally visited the estate, and was proud of\r\nthe troops of yeomanry and cavalry which had been raised from his\r\ntenantry. The second marquis, who died in 1822, was only once in\r\nthat part of Ireland. The third marquis--he of Prince Regent\r\nnotoriety--never set foot on the property; and the present, who has\r\nbeen reigning over 140 townlands for nearly thirty years, has never\r\nbeen among his subjects except during a solitary visit of three weeks\r\nin October, 1845, when, it is said, he came to qualify for his ribbon\r\n(K.G.) that he might be able to say to the prime minister that he\r\nwas a resident landlord. He has resided almost entirely in Paris,\r\ncultivating the friendship of Napoleon instead of the welfare of the\r\npeople who pay him a revenue of 60,000 l. a year. Bagatelle, his\r\nParis residence, has, it is said, absorbed Irish rents in its\r\n'improvements', till it has been made worth three quarters of a\r\nmillion sterling. If the residence cost so much, fancy may try to\r\nconceive the amount of hard-earned money squandered on the luxuries\r\nand pleasures of which it is the temple--the most Elysian spot in the\r\nElysian fields.\r\n\r\nThe following curious narrative appeared in a Belfast newspaper, and\r\nwas founded on a speech made by Dean Stannus at a public meeting.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Dean of Ross and his son, Mr. W.T. Stannus, had been\r\ndeputed to go to Paris to wait on Lord Hertfort, and urge him to\r\nassist in the expense of finishing the Antrim Junction Railway. The\r\ndean is in his eighty-first year; fifty-one years of his life have\r\nbeen spent in the management of the Hertfort estate, and whatever\r\ndifference of opinion may exist as to his arrangements with the\r\ntenantry, every one who knows anything of the affair must admit that\r\nthere never existed a more faithful representative of a landowner. On\r\narriving in Paris he found the marquis ill, so much so that neither\r\nthe dean nor his son could get an interview. For three days the\r\nvenerable gentleman danced attendance on his chief, and on Monday the\r\nfourth attempt was made, the dean sent up his name, and had a reply\r\nthat 'the marquis was too ill to see anyone.' Next day, however, the\r\nmarquis condescended to receive his agent, and the subject of the\r\nrailway was introduced. The dean told him that Lord Erne had given\r\n200,000 l. towards the railway projects on his property--that Lords\r\nLucan, Annesley, and Lifford had contributed largely, and that Lord\r\nDownshire had been exceedingly liberal in promoting lines on his\r\nestate. But all was vain. The noble absentee, who drains about 60,000\r\nl. a year from his Irish property, and who often pays 5,000 l. for\r\na picture, refused to lend 15,000 l. to aid in finishing a railway,\r\nwhich runs for three-fourths of the mileage through his own estate.\r\nDuring the interview Mr. W.T. Stannus urged on the marquis that the\r\ninvestment would be the best that could be made, as preference shares\r\npaying five per cent. would be allocated to him as security for the\r\namount. All arguments and entreaties, however, were lost on the noble\r\ninvalid. Even the appeal of the old gentleman who, for more than half\r\na century, had managed the estate so advantageously for the successive\r\nowners of that splendid property, was made in vain. 'You never refused\r\nme anything before,' urged the dean, 'and I go away in very bad\r\nspirits.' What a wonderful history lies in this episode of Irish\r\nlandlordism. Here is an unmarried nobleman whose income from\r\ninvestments in British and French securities is said to exceed 30,000\r\nl. a year, besides the immense revenue of his English and Irish\r\nestates, and yet he refuses to part with 15,000 l. towards aiding in\r\nthe construction of a railway on his own property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTENANT-RIGHT IN ARMAGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the undertakers in the county of Armagh were the two Achesons,\r\nHenry and Archibald, ancestors of Lord Gosford, who founded Market\r\nHill, Richard Houlston, John Heron, William Stanbowe, Francis\r\nSacheverell, John Dillon, John Hamilton, Sir John Davis, Lord Moore,\r\nHenry Boucher, Anthony Smith, Lieutenant Poyntz, and Henry M'Shane\r\nO'Neill.\r\n\r\nIn connection with each of these settlements Pynar uses the phrase,\r\n'I find planted and estated.' What he means is more fully explained\r\nin his reference to the precinct of Fews, allotted to Scottish\r\nundertakers, where Henry Acheson had obtained 1,000 acres. The\r\nsurveyor says: 'I find a great number of tenants on this land: but not\r\nany that have any estates but by promise, and yet they have been many\r\nyears upon the land. There are nominated to me two freeholders and\r\nseventeen leaseholders, all which were with me, and took the oath of\r\nsupremacy, and petitioned unto me that they might have their leases,\r\nthe which Mr. Acheson seemed to be willing to perform it unto them\r\npresently. These are able to make thirty men with arms. Here is great\r\nstore of tillage.' The whole of the reports indicate that the Crown\r\nrequired of the undertakers two things. First, that they should\r\nthemselves reside on the land, that they should build strong houses,\r\nfortified with bawns, and keep a certain number of armed men for\r\nthe defence of the settlement. Secondly, that the English and Scotch\r\nsettlers who were expected to reclaim the land and build houses, were\r\nto have 'estates' in their farms, either as freeholders or lessees.\r\nThe grants were made to the undertakers on these conditions--they\r\nshould be resident, and they should have around them a number of\r\nindependent yeomanry to defend the king when called upon to do so.\r\nEverything connected with the plantation gives the idea of permanent\r\ntenures for the settlers. A curious fact is mentioned about Sir John\r\nDavis, who had been so active in bringing about the plantation. He\r\nobtained a grant for 500 acres. 'Upon this,' says Pynar, 'there is\r\nnothing at all built, nor so much as an English tenant on the land.'\r\nIt seems his tenants were all of the class for whose extirpation\r\nhe pleaded, as weeds that would choke the Saxon crop. Henry M'Shane\r\nO'Neill got 1,000 acres at Camlagh, 'but he being lately dead, it was\r\nin the hands of Sir Toby Caulfield, who intended to do something upon\r\nit, for as yet there was nothing built.' Sir Toby was the ancestor of\r\nthe Earl of Charlemont, always one of the best landlords in Ulster.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find that both the undertakers and the original\r\ntenants are still fairly represented--a considerable number of the\r\nformer having founded noble houses, and the latter having multiplied\r\nand enriched the land to such an extent that, though the population\r\nis dense and the farms are generally very small, they are the most\r\nprosperous and contented population in the kingdom. Leases were common\r\nin this county at the close of the last century, but the terms were\r\nshort--twenty-one years and one life. Some had leases for thirty-one\r\nyears or three lives, and there were some perpetuities. Land was\r\nthen so valuable that when a small estate came into the market--large\r\nestates hardly ever did--they brought from twenty-five to thirty\r\nyears' purchase. The large tracts of church land, which are now among\r\nthe richest and most desirable in the country, presented at the\r\nclose of the last century, a melancholy contrast to the farms that\r\nsurrounded them. The reason is given by Sir Charles Coote. It is most\r\ninstructive and suggestive at the present time. He says, 'It is very\r\ndiscouraging for a wealthy farmer to have anything to do with church\r\nlands, as his improvements cannot even be secured to him during his\r\nown life, or the life of his landlord, but he may at any time be\r\ndeprived of the fruits of his industry, by the incumbent changing his\r\nliving, as his interest then terminates.' This evil was remedied first\r\nby making the leases renewable, on the payment of fines, and, in our\r\nown time, an act was passed enabling the tenants to convert their\r\nleaseholds into perpetuities. The consequence is, that the church\r\nlands now present some of the finest features in the social landscape,\r\noccupied by a class of resident gentry, an essential link, in any\r\nwell-organised society, between the people and the great proprietors.\r\nThe Board of Trinity College felt so strongly the necessity of giving\r\nfixed tenures, if permanent improvements were to be effected on their\r\nestates, that, without waiting for a general measure of land reform,\r\nthey obtained, in 1861, a private act of parliament giving them power\r\nto grant leases for ninety-nine years. 'The legislature,' says Dr.\r\nHancock, 'thus gave partial effect in the case of one institution to\r\nthe recommendation which the Land Occupation Commissioners intended to\r\napply to all estates in the hands of public boards in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nArmagh was always free from middlemen. The landlord got what Sir\r\nCharles Coote calls a rack rent from the occupying tenant, and it\r\nwas his interest to divide rather than consolidate farms, because the\r\nlinen trade enabled the small holder to give a high rent, while\r\nthe custom of tenant-right furnished an unfailing security for its\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nThe country, when seen from an elevation, is one continuous patchwork\r\nof corn, potatoes, clover, and other artificial grasses. Wonders\r\nare wrought in the way of productiveness by rotation of crops and\r\nhouse-feeding. Cattle are not only fattened much more rapidly than on\r\nthe richest grazing land, but large quantities of the best manure are\r\nproduced by the practice of house-feeding. The more northern portions\r\nof the county, bordering on Down and Lough Neagh, and along the banks\r\nof the rivers Bann and Blackwater, are naturally rich, and have been\r\nimproved to the highest degree by ages of skilful cultivation. But\r\nother parts, particularly the barony of Fews, embracing the high\r\nlands stretching to the Newry mountains, and bordering on the County\r\nMonaghan, were, about the close of the last century, nearly all\r\ncovered with heather, and absolutely waste. Sir Charles Coote\r\nremarked, in 1804, that it had been then undergoing reclamation.\r\nWithin the last fifteen years the land had doubled in value, and was\r\nset at the average rate of 16 s. an acre. Mr. Tickell, referring to\r\nthis county, remarked that the Scotch and English settlers chiefly\r\noccupied the lowland districts, and that the natives retired to this\r\npoor region, retaining their old language and habits; and he was\r\noccasionally obliged to swear interpreters where witnesses or parties\r\ncame from the Fews, which were 'very wild, and very unlike other parts\r\nof the county of Armagh.'\r\n\r\nNow let us see what the industry of the people has done in that wild\r\ndistrict. The farms are very small, say from three to ten English\r\nacres. They have been so well drained, cleared, sub-soiled, and\r\nmanured, that the occupier is able to support on one acre as many\r\ncattle as on three acres when grazed; while affording profitable\r\nemployment to the women and children. Great labour has been bestowed\r\nin taking down crooked and broad fences. Every foot of ground is\r\ncultivated with the greatest care, and in the mountain districts,\r\npatches of land among rocks, inaccessible to horses, are tilled by the\r\nhand. In many cases in the less exposed districts, two crops in the\r\nyear are obtained from the same ground, viz., winter tares followed by\r\nturnips or cabbages, and rape followed by tares, potatoes, turnips,\r\nor cabbages. These crops are succeeded by grain or flax the next year,\r\nwith which clover is sown for mowing and stall-feeding, yielding two\r\nor three cuttings. The green crops are so timed as to give a full\r\nsupply for house-feeding throughout the year. Nothing is neglected by\r\nthose skilful and thrifty farmers; the county is famous for orchards,\r\nand when I was in the city of Armagh, last autumn, I saw in the market\r\nsquare almost as many loads of apples as of potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe connection of large grazing farms with pauperism, as cause and\r\neffect, has not received sufficient attention from the friends\r\nof social progress. I resolved last year to test this matter by a\r\ncomparison. We have at present no check upon the legally enforced\r\ndepopulation of this country except the _interest_ of the landlords,\r\nor what they imagine to be their interest. It is well that the\r\nquestion should be determined whether it is really for the benefit\r\nof the owners of the land that they should clear it of Christians and\r\noccupy it with cattle--in other words, whether Christians or cattle\r\nwill pay more rent and taxes. I omit all higher considerations,\r\nbecause some of the most philanthropic and enlightened defenders of\r\nthe present land system have defended it on this low ground. In order\r\nto make the test complete and unexceptionable, I have selected a\r\ncomparatively poor district for tillage, and one of the richest I\r\ncould find for grazing, giving all possible natural advantages to\r\nScullyism. But the test would not be fair unless the occupiers of the\r\npoorer land had a tolerably secure tenure so long as they paid the\r\nhighest rent that a reasonable agent could impose. I thought also that\r\npossible objections would be obviated if the tenantry were destitute\r\nof 'the fostering care of a resident landlord.' Therefore, instead\r\nof selecting the tenants of Lord Downshire, or Lord Roden, or Lord\r\nDufferin, I have fixed upon the tenants of Lord Kilmorey, because he\r\nand the producers of the rents which he enjoys have never seen\r\none another in the flesh, and they have never received one word of\r\nencouragement or instruction from him in the whole course of their\r\nlives. Accordingly, with the Union of Kilkeel, which comprises the\r\nMourne district, I have compared the Union of Trim, which comprises\r\nsome of the richest grazing land in Ireland. Travellers have noted\r\nthat population always grows thick on rich lands, while it is sparse\r\non poor lands. No one requires to be told the reason of this.\r\n\r\nThe Unions of Kilkeel and Trim have populations very nearly\r\nequal--viz., Kilkeel, 22,614; Trim, 22,918. The total arable land in\r\nKilkeel is 50,000 statute acres, giving 2 1/3 acres on an average\r\nfor each person, and 14 acres for each holding. Trim contains 119,519\r\nstatute acres, giving 5 acres to each person, and 42 to each holding.\r\n\r\nIn Mourne the area of land under crops is 20,904 acres (nearly half),\r\ngiving one acre of tillage to each inhabitant, and 6 acres to each\r\nholding of 14 acres. In Trim the area under crops is 38,868 acres,\r\ngiving 2 acres for each inhabitant, and 14 for each holding of 42\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these figures is shown by the Government valuation\r\nin 1867. The valuation of Mourne Union is 40,668 l., the average for\r\neach person being 2 l. and for each holding 11 l. The valuation of\r\nTrim is 109,068 l., allowing 5 l. for each person and 38 l. for each\r\nholding. In other words, the capability of the land of Trim to support\r\npopulation is as five to two when compared with Mourne; but whereas\r\nin Mourne 2 1/3 acres support one person, in Trim it takes 5 acres\r\nto support one person--about double the quantity. As the value of the\r\nland in Meath is more than double what it is in Mourne, each acre in\r\nMeath ought to maintain its man. That is, if Meath were cultivated\r\nlike Down, its population ought to be _five times as large as it is_!\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole case. The Mourne population may be too\r\nlarge. With so many families crowded on such a small tract of poor\r\nland, the Union must be overwhelmed with pauperism. If so, the case\r\nfor tenant-right and tillage would fall to the ground, and Scullyism\r\nwould be triumphant. Let us see, then, how stands this essential fact.\r\nThe number of paupers in the workhouse and receiving outdoor relief in\r\nthe Union of Trim, in 1866, was 2,474. This large amount of pauperism\r\nis not peculiar to Trim. It belongs to other Unions of this rich\r\ngrazing district, which so fully realises the late Lord Carlisle's\r\nideal of Irish prosperity. Navan Union has 3,820 paupers, and Kells\r\nhas 1,306. Now, the population of Trim and Mourne being nearly the\r\nsame, and Trim being twice as rich as Mourne, and not half as thickly\r\npeopled, it follows that Mourne ought to have at least four times as\r\nmany paupers as Trim--that is, it ought to have 9,896. But it actually\r\nhas only 521 persons receiving relief in and out of the workhouse!\r\n\r\nConsequently, Scullyism and grazing produce nearly twenty times the\r\namount of poverty and misery produced by tenant-right and tillage.\r\n\r\nI have not overlooked the difference of race and religion. On the\r\ncontrary, they were uppermost in my mind when rambling among the\r\nnice, clean, comfortable, orderly homesteads of Mourne, reminding me\r\nstrongly of Forth and Bargy in the county Wexford. I said to the owner\r\nand driver of my car, who is a Roman Catholic, 'Do the Roman\r\nCatholics here keep their houses and farms in as nice order as the\r\nPresbyterians?' He answered, 'Why should they not? Are they not the\r\nsame flesh and blood?'\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1861, the Roman Catholics greatly outnumber\r\nthe Protestants in this Union. The exact figures are:--\r\n\r\nTotal population of Mourne Union     22,614\r\nProtestants of all denominations      8,080\r\nRoman Catholics                      14,534\r\n\r\nThe result of this comparison may perhaps make a better impression\r\non the reader's mind if cast in the form of tables, as given on\r\nsucceeding page.\r\n\r\nTable Headings:\r\n\r\nCol A.

Trim, in that year, produced only 78 acres of\r\nflax.\r\n\r\nWhat everyone wants to know now is this--whether any measure can be\r\ndevised that will satisfy the cultivators of the soil without wronging\r\nthe landlords, or militating against the interests of the state. A\r\nmeasure that will not satisfy the tenants and put an end to their\r\ndiscontent, would be manifestly useless. It would be but adding to the\r\nnumerous legislative abortions that have gone before it. A man engaged\r\nin such enquiries as this, is to ascertain what will satisfy the\r\npeople. It is for the legislature to determine whether it can be\r\nrightly or safely granted. I have, therefore, directed my attention to\r\nthis point in particular, and I have ascertained beyond question, from\r\nthe best possible sources of information, that nothing will satisfy\r\nthe people of this country but what they do not hesitate to name with\r\nthe most determined emphasis--'Fixity of Tenure.' Whether they are\r\nProtestants or Catholics, Orangemen or Liberals, Presbyterians or\r\nChurchmen, this is their unanimous demand, the cry in which they all\r\njoin to a man. Every case in which tenant-right is disregarded, or in\r\nwhich, while admitted nominally, an attempt is made to evade it, or\r\nto fritter it away, excites the bitterest feeling, in which the whole\r\ncommunity sympathises.\r\n\r\nThey deny, however, that the existing tenant-right is a sufficient\r\nsecurity:--\r\n\r\nBecause it depends on the option of the landlord, and cannot be\r\nenforced by law.\r\n\r\nBecause even the best disposed landlord may be influenced to alter his\r\npolicy by the advice of an agent, by the influence of his family, or\r\nby the state of his finances.\r\n\r\nBecause a good landlord, who knows the tenants and cares for them, may\r\nbe succeeded by a son who is a 'fast young man,' addicted to the\r\nturf and overwhelmed in debt, while the estate gets into the hands of\r\nusurers.\r\n\r\nBecause in such a case the law affords no protection to the property\r\nof the tenant, which his family may have been accumulating on the\r\nland since the first of them came over from England or Scotland,\r\nand settled around their commander, after helping by their swords to\r\nconquer the country, and preserve it to the crown of England.\r\n\r\nBecause it is not in human nature to avoid encroaching on the rights\r\nand property of others, if it can be done at will--done legally, and\r\ndone under the pretext that it is necessary for 'improvement,' and\r\nwill be a benefit even to those who are despoiled.\r\n\r\nBecause the custom is no protection to a man's political rights as\r\na British subject. No tenant farmer can vote against his landlord in\r\nobedience to his conscience without the risk of ruining his family.\r\nThe greater his interest in the land, the larger his investments,\r\nthe heavier his stake; the greater his accumulations in his bank--the\r\nfarm--the greater will be his dependence, the more complete\r\nhis political bondage. He has the more to lose. Therefore, if a\r\nConservative, he must vote for a Radical or a Catholic, who would pull\r\ndown the Church Establishment; or if a Catholic, he must vote for a\r\n'No-popery' candidate, who ignores tenant-right, and against a\r\nLiberal statesman, whose life has been devoted to the interests of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the difficulty of settling this question is\r\nmuch aggravated by the importation of opinions from the United States\r\nhostile to the aristocracy; and as this source of discontent and\r\ndistrust is likely to increase every year, the sooner the settlement\r\nis effected the better. What is the use of scolding and reviling the\r\ntenant's advocates? Will that weaken one iota the tremendous force of\r\nsocial discontent--the bitter sense of legal injustice, with which\r\nthe legislature must deal? And will the legislature deal with it more\r\neffectually by shutting its eyes to facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFARNEY--MR. TRENCH'S 'REALITIES.'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the six Ulster counties were confiscated, and the natives were\r\nall deprived of their rights in the soil, the people of the county\r\nCavan resolved to appeal for justice to the English courts in Dublin.\r\nThe Crown was defended by Sir John Davis. He argued that the Irish\r\ncould have no legal rights, no property in the land, because they did\r\nnot enclose it with fences, or plant orchards. True, they had boundary\r\nmarks for their tillage ground; but they followed the Eastern custom\r\nin not building ditches or walls around their farms. They did not\r\nplant orchards, because they had too many trees already that grew\r\nwithout planting. The woods were common property, and the apples,\r\nif they had any, would be common property too, like the nuts and the\r\nacorns.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were obliged to submit to the terms imposed by the\r\nconquerors, glad in their destitution to be permitted to occupy their\r\nown lands as tenants at will. The English undertakers, as we have\r\nseen, were bound to deal differently with the English settlers; but\r\ntheir obligations resolved themselves into promises of freeholds and\r\nleases which were seldom granted, so that many persons threw up their\r\nfarms in despair, and returned to their own country.\r\n\r\nIn the border county of Monaghan, we have a good illustration of the\r\nmanner in which the natives struggled to live under their new masters.\r\nThe successors of some of those masters have in modern times taken a\r\nstrange fancy to the study of Irish antiquities. Among these is Evelyn\r\nP. Shirley, Esq., who has published 'Some Account of the Territory\r\nor Dominion of Farney.' The account is interesting, and, taken in\r\nconnection with the sequel given to the public by his agent, Mr. W.\r\nSteuart Trench, it furnishes an instructive chapter in the history\r\nof the land war. The whole barony of Farney was granted by Queen\r\nElizabeth to Walter Earl of Essex in the year 1576, in reward for the\r\nmassacres already recorded. It was then an almost unenclosed plain,\r\nconsisting chiefly of coarse pasturage, interspersed with low\r\nalder-scrub. When the primitive woods were cut down for fuel,\r\ncharcoal, or other purposes, the stumps remained in the ground, and\r\nfrom these fresh shoots sprang up thickly. The clearing out of these\r\nstumps was difficult and laborious; but it had to be done before\r\nanything, but food for goats, could be got out of the land. This was\r\n'the M'Mahons' country,' and the tribe was not wholly subdued till\r\n1606, when the power of the Ulster chiefs was finally broken. The\r\nlord deputy, the chancellor, and the lord chief justice passed through\r\nFarney on their way to hold assizes for the first time in Derry and\r\nDonegal. They were protected by a guard of 'seven score foot, and\r\nfifty or three score horse, which,' wrote Sir John Davis, 'is an\r\nargument of a good time and a confident deputy; for in former times\r\n(when the state enjoyed the best peace and security) no lord deputy\r\ndid ever venture himself into those parts, without an army of 800 or\r\n1000 men.' At this time Lord Essex had leased the barony of Farney\r\nto Evor M'Mahon for a yearly rent of 250 l. payable in Dublin. After\r\nfourteen years the same territory was let to Brian M'Mahon for 1,500\r\nl. In the year 1636, the property yielded a yearly rent of 2022 l.\r\n18 s. 4 d. paid by thirty-eight tenants. A map then taken gives the\r\nseveral townlands and denominations nearly as they are at present.\r\nRobert Earl of Essex, dying in 1646, his estates devolved on his\r\nsisters, Lady Frances and Lady Dorothy Devereux, the former of whom\r\nmarried Sir W. Seymour, afterwards Marquis of Hertfort, and the latter\r\nSir Henry Shirley, Bart., ancestor of the present proprietor of half\r\nthe barony. Ultimately the other half became the property of the\r\nMarquis of Bath. At the division in 1690, each moiety was valued at\r\n1313 l. 14 s. 4-1/2 d. Gradually as the lands were reclaimed by the\r\ntenants, the rental rose. In 1769 the Bath estate produced 3,000 l.,\r\nand the Shirley estate 5,000 l. The total of 8,000 l. per annum, from\r\nthis once wild and barren tract, was paid by middlemen. The natives\r\nhad not been rooted out, and during the eighteenth century these\r\nsub-tenants multiplied rapidly. According to the census in 1841 the\r\npopulation of the barony exceeded 44,000 souls, and they contributed\r\nby their industry, to the two absentee proprietors, the enormous\r\nannual revenue of 40,000 l., towards the production of which it does\r\nnot appear that either of them, or any person for them, ever invested\r\na shilling.\r\n\r\nMr. S. Trench was amazed to find 'more than one human being for every\r\nIrish acre of land in the barony, and nearly one human being for every\r\n1 l. valuation per annum of the land.' The two estates join in the\r\ntown of Carrickmacross. When Mr. Trench arrived there, March 30, 1843,\r\nto commence his duties as Mr. Shirley's agent, he learned that the\r\nsudden death of the late agent in the court-house of Monaghan had been\r\ncelebrated that night by fires on almost every hill on the estate,\r\n'and over a district of upwards of 20,000 acres there was scarcely\r\na mile without a bonfire blazing in manifestation of joy at his\r\ndecease.' Mr. Trench says, the tenants considered themselves\r\nground down to the last point by the late agent. As he relates the\r\ncircumstances, the people would seem to be a very savage race; and\r\nhe gives other more startling illustrations to the same effect as he\r\nproceeds. But here, as elsewhere, he does not state all the facts,\r\nwhile those he does state are most artistically dressed up for\r\nsensational effect, Mr. Trench himself being always the hero, always\r\nacting magnificently, appearing at the right place and at the right\r\nmoment to prevent some tremendous calamity, otherwise inevitable, and\r\nby some mysterious personal influence subduing lawless masses, so\r\nthat by a sudden impulse, their murderous rage is converted into\r\nadmiration, if not adoration. Like the hearers of Herod or of St.\r\nPaul, when he flung the viper off his hand, they are ready to cry out,\r\n'He is a god, and not a man.' Of course he, as a Christian gentleman,\r\nwas always 'greatly shocked,' when these poor wretches offered him\r\npetitions on their knees. Still he relates every case of the kind with\r\nextraordinary unction, and with a picturesqueness of situation and\r\ndetail so stagey that it should make Mr. Boucicault's mouth water, and\r\nexcite the envy of Miss Braddon. Not even she can exceed the author of\r\n'Realities of Irish Life,' in prolonging painful suspense, in piling\r\nup the agony, in accumulating horrors, in throwing strong lights on\r\none side of the picture and casting deep shade on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is with the greatest reluctance that I thus allude to the work of\r\nMr. Trench. I do so from a sense of duty, because I believe it is one\r\nof the most misleading books on Ireland published for many years. It\r\nhas made false impressions on the public mind in England, which will\r\nseriously interfere with a proper settlement of the land question.\r\nThe mischief would not be so great if the author did not take so\r\nmuch pains to represent his stories as realities 'essentially\r\ncharacteristic of the country.' It is very difficult to account for\r\nthe exaggeration and embellishment in which he has permitted himself\r\nto indulge, with so many professions of conscientious regard for\r\ntruth. They must have arisen from the habit of reciting the adventures\r\nto his friends during a quarter of a century, naturally laying stress\r\non the most sensational passages, while the facts less in keeping with\r\nstartling effects dropped out of his memory. Very few of the actors in\r\nthe scenes he describes now survive. Those who do, and who might\r\nhave a more accurate memory, are either so lauded that it would\r\nbe ungrateful of them to contradict--or so artfully discredited as\r\n'virulent' and base that people would not be likely to believe them if\r\ntheir recollections were different. There is one peculiarity about Mr.\r\nTrench's dialogues. There were never any witnesses present. He always\r\ntook the wild Irishman, on whom he operated so magically, into his\r\nprivate office; or into a private room in the house of the 'subject;'\r\nor into a cell alone, if secrets were to be extracted from a Ribbonman\r\nin gaol. Even conversations with the gentler sex, who knelt before\r\nhim as if he were a bishop, were not permitted to reach the ear of his\r\nchief clerk. On some matters, however, others have spoken since his\r\nbook appeared. He is very precise about the trial for an agrarian\r\nmurder in Monaghan, giving details from his own actual observation.\r\nMr. Butt, Q.C., who was engaged in the case, has published a letter,\r\nstating that Mr. Trench was quite mistaken in his account. It seems\r\nstrange that he did not refresh his memory by looking at a report of\r\nthe trial in some newspaper file.\r\n\r\nMr. Trench 'adds his testimony to the fact that Ireland is not\r\naltogether unmanageable,' that 'justice fully and firmly administered\r\nis always appreciated in the end.' And at the conclusion of his volume\r\nhe says:--\r\n\r\n'We can scarcely shut our eyes to the fact that the circumstances and\r\nfeelings which have led to the terrible crime of murder in Ireland,\r\nare usually very different from those which have led to murder\r\nelsewhere. The reader of the English newspaper is shocked at the list\r\nof children murdered by professional assassins, of wives murdered\r\nby their husbands, of men murdered for their gold. In Ireland that\r\ndreadful crime may almost invariably be traced to a wild feeling of\r\nrevenge for the national wrongs, to which so many of her sons believe\r\nthat she has been subjected for centuries.'\r\n\r\nThere is a mistake here. No murders are committed in Ireland for\r\n'national wrongs.' The author has gathered together, as in a chamber\r\nof horrors, all the cases of assassination that occurred during\r\nthe years of distress, provoked by the extensive _evictions_ which\r\nsucceeded the _famine_, and by the infliction of great hardships on\r\ntenants who, in consequence of that dreadful calamity, had fallen\r\ninto arrears. People who had been industrious, peaceable, and\r\nwell-conducted were thus driven to desperation; and hence the young\r\nmen formed lawless combinations and committed atrocious murders.\r\nBut every one of these murders was agrarian, not national. They were\r\ncommitted in the prosecution of _a war_, not against the Government,\r\nbut against the landlords and their agents and instruments. It was a\r\nwar _pro aris et focis_, waged against local tyrants, and waged in the\r\nonly way possible to the belligerents who fought for home and\r\nfamily. Mr. Trench always paints the people who sympathise with their\r\nchampions as naturally wild, lawless, and savage. If he happens to\r\nbe in good humour with them, he makes them ridiculous. His son, Mr.\r\nTownsend Trench, who did the illustrations for the work, pictures the\r\npeasantry as gorillas, always flourishing shillelaghs, and grinning\r\nhorribly. With rare exceptions, they appear as an inferior race, while\r\nthe ruling class, and the Trenches in particular, appear throughout\r\nthe book as demigods, 'lords of the creation,' formed by nature to be\r\nthe masters and guides and managers of such a silly, helpless people.\r\nNowhere is any censure pronounced upon a landlord, or an agent, with\r\none exception, and this was the immediate predecessor of Mr. Trench\r\nat Kenmare. To his gross neglect in allowing God to send so many human\r\nbeings into the world, he ascribes the chaos of misery and pauperism,\r\nwhich he--a heaven-born agent--had to reduce to order and beauty.\r\nBut there were other causes of the 'poetic turbulence' which he\r\nso gloriously quelled, that he might have brought to light, had he\r\nthought proper, for the information of English readers. He might have\r\nshown--for the evidence was before him in the report of the Devon\r\nCommission--with what hard toil and constant self-denial, amidst what\r\ndomestic privations and difficulties, Mr. Shirley's tenants struggled\r\nto scrape up for him his 20,000 l. a year, and how bitterly they must\r\nhave felt when the landlord sent an order to add one-third to their\r\nrack-rent. I will supply Mr. Trench's lack of service, and quote the\r\nevidence of one of those honest and worthy men, given before the Devon\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\nPeter Mohun, farmer, a tenant on the Shirley estate, gave the\r\nfollowing evidence:--\r\n\r\n'What family have you?--I am married, and have two daughters, and my\r\nwife, and a servant boy.\r\n\r\n'What rent do you pay?--Sometime ago I paid 3 l. 19 s. 11d. I was\r\ndoing well at that time; and then my rent was raised to 5 l. 19 s. 9\r\nd., and sometimes 6 l., and one year 5 l. 19 s. 6 d.\r\n\r\n'How do you account for the difference?--I do not know; perhaps by the\r\nbog rent. We had the bog free before, and we were doing well; and then\r\nwe were cut down from the bog, and we were raised from 3 l. 19 s. 11\r\nd. to 6 l. We are beaten down now quite.\r\n\r\n'What does the county-cess come to?--Sometimes we pay 1 s. 6-1/2 d. an\r\nacre, and oftener 1 s. 7-1/2 d., the half-year.\r\n\r\n'Have you paid your rent pretty punctually?--Yes, I have done my best\r\nso far to pay the rent.\r\n\r\n'How much do you owe now?--I believe I shall pay the rent directly\r\nafter May; I am clear till May. I cannot pay it till harvest comes\r\nround.\r\n\r\n'How do you get the money to pay the rent?--When I had my land cheap,\r\nand myself a youth, I was a good workman, and did work by the loom,\r\nand I would be mowing in the summer season, and earn a good deal, and\r\nmake a little store for me, which has stood by me. I buy some oats and\r\nmake meal of it, and I make money in that way. It was not by my land I\r\nwas paying my rent, but from other sources.\r\n\r\n'How much wheat have you now?--Half an acre, rather above.\r\n\r\n'How much oats have you?--Half a rood.\r\n\r\n'How much potato land shall you have?--Three and a half roods besides\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n'Have you any clover?--Very near a rood of clover.\r\n\r\n'What is the smallest quantity of land that you think a man who has\r\nno other means of support can subsist and pay rent upon?--I was paying\r\nrent well myself when I had three acres, when I was paying 3 l. 19 s.\r\n11 d.\r\n\r\n'You weave a little?--Yes, but very little; but there was a good price\r\nfor the barrel of wheat, and for pigs, and so I made a little store.\r\nBut as for any man to support himself out of a small farm, at the\r\nhigh price of land, and the price of labour that is going, it is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n'What is the smallest farm upon which a man can support himself at the\r\npresent rate of rent, taking a man with five or six children?--That is\r\na hard question.\r\n\r\n'Supposing a man to pay 35 s. an acre, and to have two acres, and to\r\nbe obliged to live out of the farm, do you think he could do it and\r\npay rent?--He could not; his land must be very good. Unless he lived\r\nnear a town, and had cheap land, it would be impossible. But a man\r\nwith five acres, at a moderate rent, he could support his family upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'What should you earn at weaving?--I only weave for my own family. I\r\nweave my own shirt.\r\n\r\n'Do your family ever spin any wool and weave it?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'Do you live upon the Shirley estate?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'How much bog do you require to keep your house in fuel?--Half a rood,\r\nif it was good; but it is bad bog ground, red mossy turf, white and\r\nlight; it requires more than the black turf.\r\n\r\n'What do you pay for half a rood of turf?--It is 13 s. 4 d. for a\r\nrood--that is, 6 s. 8 d. for half a rood. There is 4 s. 6 d. paid for\r\nbad bog.\r\n\r\n'Do you pay anything for the ticket of leave to cut?--Yes, I do; I\r\nhave not a ticket unless I pay 6 d. for it.\r\n\r\n'That is over and above the 4 s. 6 d.?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'Did you ever pay more than 6 s. 8 d. for the bog in the late agent's\r\ntime?--He took the good bog off us; we were paying 6 s. 8 d. for it.\r\nThey left us to the bad bog, and we do not pay so high for that.\r\n\r\n'Was the good bog dearer or cheaper than the bad bog at 4 s. 6\r\nd.?--Half a rood of the good bog was worth half an acre or an acre of\r\nthe other. The bad bog smokes so we have often to leave the house: we\r\ncannot stay in it unless there is a good draught in the chimney.'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Smollan, P.P., has published a letter to the Earl of\r\nDunraven, a Catholic Peer, to whom Mr. Trench has dedicated his book.\r\nIn this letter the parish priest of Farney says:--\r\n\r\n'In pages 63 and 64 Mr. Trench tells his readers that on the very\r\nnight the news of the late agent's sudden death, in the county\r\ncourthouse of Monaghan, reached Carrickmacross, \"fires blazed on\r\nalmost every hill on the Shirley estate, and over a district of more\r\nthan 20,000 acres there was scarcely a mile without a bonfire blazing\r\nin manifestation of joy at his decease.\" This paragraph, my lord,\r\ntaken by itself and unexplained in any way, would at once imply that\r\nthe people were inhuman, almost savages, whom Mr. Trench was sent to\r\ntame--that they were insensible to the agent's sudden death, a death\r\nso sudden that it would make an enemy almost relent. Mr. Trench\r\nassigns no cause for this strange proceeding except what we read in\r\npage 64, and what he learned from the chief clerk, viz., \"that the\r\npeople were much excited, that they were ground down to the last point\r\nby the late agent, and they were threatening to rise in rebellion\r\nagainst him,\" &c. One would think that Mr. Trench having learned so\r\nmuch on such authority, would have set to work to try and find out\r\nthe cause of the discontent and apply a remedy. He does not say in his\r\nbook that he did so, but seems still unable to understand this to him\r\nincomprehensible proceeding. However, I am of opinion that Mr. Trench\r\nknew the whole of it, if not then at all events before \"The Realities\"\r\nsaw the light, for in a speech of his, when Lord Bath visited Farney\r\n(page 383), he said, \"A dog could not bark on the estate without\r\nit coming to his knowledge.\" And therefore I say that a man so\r\ninquisitive as to find out the barking of a dog on the Bath estate,\r\nwho had so many sources of information close at hand, could not have\r\nbeen long without knowing the causes of the \"excitement, threatened\r\nrebellion, bonfires, &c., on the Shirley estate,\" if he had only\r\nwished for the information. Either he knew the cause of all this when\r\nhe wrote his book, or he did not. If he did, I say he was bound\r\nin fair play to tell it to the public; if he did not know it his\r\nself-laudation in his speech goes for nought. But, my lord, with your\r\npermission, I will inform your lordship, Mr. Trench, and the public,\r\nas to some of the causes of so remarkable an occurrence, which could\r\nnot pass unobserved by Mr. Trench. At the memorable election of 1826,\r\nEvelyn John Shirley, Esq., and Colonel Leslie, father of the present\r\nM.P., contested the county of Monaghan, and the former brought all\r\nhis influence to bear on his tenants to vote for himself (Shirley)\r\nand Leslie, who coalesced against the late Lord Rossmore. The electors\r\nsaid \"they would give one vote for their landlord, and the other they\r\nwould give for their religion and their country;\" the consequence was,\r\nShirley and Westenra were returned, and Leslie was beaten. Up to this\r\ntime Mr. Shirley was a good landlord, and admitted tenant-right to\r\nthe fullest extent on the property, but after that election he never\r\nshowed the same friendly feelings towards the people. Soon after the\r\nelection Mr. Humphrey Evatt, the agent, died, and was succeeded in the\r\nagency by Mr. Sandy Mitchell, who very soon set about surveying and\r\nrevaluing the estate, of course at the instance of his master, Evelyn\r\nJohn Shirley, Esq. He performed the work of revaluation, &c., and\r\nthe result was that the rents were increased by one-third and in\r\nsome cases more. The bog, too, which up to this time was free to the\r\ntenants, was taken from them and doled out to them in small patches of\r\nfrom twenty-five to forty perches each, at from 4 l. to 8 l. per\r\nacre. At the instance of the then parish priest, President Reilly, Mr.\r\nShirley gave 5 l. per year to a few schools on his property, without\r\ninterfering in any way with the religious principles of the Catholics\r\nattending these schools; but the then agent insisted on having the\r\nauthorised version of the Bible, without note or comment, read in\r\nthose schools by the Catholic children. The bishop, the Most Rev. Dr.\r\nKernan, could not tolerate such a barefaced attempt at proselytism,\r\nand insisted on the children being withdrawn from the schools. For\r\nobeying their bishop in this, the Catholic parents were treated most\r\nunsparingly. I have before me just now a most remarkable instance\r\nof the length to which this gentleman carried his proselytising\r\npropensities, which I will mention. In the vestry, or sacristy,\r\nattached to Corduff Chapel, was a school taught by a man named Rush,\r\naltogether independent of the schools aided by Mr. Shirley, and by\r\nlargely subsidising the teacher, the then agent actually introduced\r\nhis proselytism into that school too. The priests and people tried\r\nlegal means to get rid of the teacher, but without success, and in the\r\nend the people came by night and knocked down the sacristy, so that in\r\nthe morning when the teacher came he had no house to shelter him.\r\nThe Catholics were then without a school, and in order to provide the\r\nmeans of education for them the Rev. F. Keone, administrator, under\r\nthe Most Rev. Dr. Kernan, applied for aid to the Commissioners of\r\nNational Education, and obtained it; but where was he to procure\r\nbuilding materials? The then agent, in his zeal for \"converting\"\r\nCatholics, having issued an order forbidding the supplying of them\r\nfrom any part of the Shirley estate, which extends over an area of\r\nfifteen miles by ten, Father Keone went on the next Sunday to the\r\nneighbouring chapels outside the Shirley estate, told his grievances,\r\nand on the next day the people came with their horses and carts and\r\nleft sand, lime, and stones in sufficient quantities to build the\r\nhouse inside the chapel-yard. The priest and people thought it\r\nnecessary to \"thatch\" their old chapel, and, though strange it may\r\nseem, the agent actually served an ejectment process on the father\r\nof the two boys who assisted the priest to make the collection at the\r\nchapel door for so absolutely necessary a work. I may add, this man\r\nowed no rent. Lastly, the then agent was in the habit of arranging\r\nmatrimonial alliances, pointing out this girl as a suitable match for\r\nthat boy, and the boy must marry the girl or give up his farm. These\r\nfacts being true, my lord, and more which I might state, but that I\r\nhave trespassed too much already on your lordship's time, I ask you,\r\nmy Lord Dunraven--I ask any impartial man, Irishman or Englishman--for\r\nwhom Mr. Trench wrote his \"book,\" is it strange or wonderful that the\r\nCatholic people, so treated, would rejoice--would have bonfires on\r\nthe hill tops at their deliverance from such conduct? I flatter myself\r\nthat you, my lord--that the learned reading public--that the English\r\npeople would sympathise with any people so treated for conscience'\r\nsake; and having pronounced the sentence of condemnation against Mr.\r\nTrench for not having noticed these facts, that you will direct your\r\nname to be erased from the \"book.\" I have the honour to remain,\r\nmy lord, with the most profound respect, your lordship's faithful\r\nservant.'\r\n\r\n  'THOMAS SMOLLAN, P.P.\r\n\r\n  'Clones, Feb. 15, 1869.'\r\n\r\nThe electors of Monaghan, in their simplicity, thought they were\r\nfairly exercising the rights conferred by the constitution when they\r\ngave one vote for the landlord, and one for their religion and their\r\ncountry, thus securing the return of one Liberal. But Mr. Shirley soon\r\ntaught them that the blessings of our glorious constitution belong not\r\nto the tenant, but to the landlord; and so he punished their mistake\r\nby adding one-third to their rent, and depriving them of proper fuel.\r\nNot content with this, he carried the war into their chapels and\r\nschools, and punished them for their religion. These facts may help to\r\nexplain the scenes which Mr. Trench describes so poetically.\r\n\r\nThe persecuting agent died suddenly in the court-house. The landlord\r\nand a new agent, Mr. Trench, arrived at Carrickmacross; and the\r\ntenants presented a petition, imploring him to remove the new and\r\nintolerable burden that had been put on their shoulders. They were\r\ntold to come back for an answer on the following Monday:--\r\n\r\n'\"Monday! Monday!\" was shouted on all sides. The most frenzied\r\nexcitement ensued. Hats were thrown in the air, sticks were flourished\r\non all sides, and the men actually danced with wild delight. After a\r\nlittle time, however, the crowd cleared away, and the news flew like\r\nwildfire over the town and country, that the whole tenantry were told\r\nto come in on Monday next, that they might know the amount of the\r\nreduction to be granted, and have all their grievances removed!'\r\n\r\nMr. Shirley quickly repented having given the invitation, and sent out\r\na circular countermanding it, and requesting the tenants to stay at\r\nhome. On Monday, however, a vast excited mass assembled to hear his\r\n_ultimatum_, which was announced by the new agent. 'He would not\r\nreduce their rents. They might give up their lands if they pleased;\r\nbut they had little or no cause of complaint.' They insisted on his\r\nmounting a chair and making a speech. He softened the message as well\r\nas he could. When he had done there was a dead silence. In describing\r\nwhat follows Mr. Trench surpasses the wildest romancers in piling\r\nup the agony. I copy the description that the reader may see the\r\ndifference between romance and history.\r\n\r\n'There was a dead silence when I stopped speaking. It was broken by a\r\nstentorian voice.\r\n\r\n'\"Then you won't reduce our rents?\"\r\n\r\n'\"I have already given you Mr. Shirley's answer upon that point,\" said\r\nI. \"Stranger as I am, it is impossible for me to form any opinion as\r\nto whether they are too high or not.\"\r\n\r\n'\"_Down on your knees, boys!_\" shouted the same voice; \"we will ask\r\nhim once more upon our knees!\" and to my horror and amazement the vast\r\ncrowd, almost all at least who were in my immediate vicinity, dropped\r\nsuddenly on their knees, and another dead silence ensued.\r\n\r\n'It was a dreadful spectacle. Their hats were on their heads, and\r\ntheir sticks in their hands, some leaning upon them as they knelt,\r\nothers balancing and grasping them. It was fearful to see the attitude\r\nof supplication, due only to a higher power, thus mingled with a wild\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\n'\"_We ask you upon our knees, for God's sake, to get us a reduction of\r\nour rents!_\" again the same voice cried aloud.\r\n\r\n'I was greatly shocked. I instantly got down off the chair. I\r\nentreated them to rise. I told them that I was distressed beyond\r\nmeasure, but that I had given them the only message I was authorised\r\nto give; and quite overcome by such a scene, I endeavoured to move\r\nagain across the crowded space from the office, in order to enter the\r\nhouse, and report proceedings to Mr. Shirley, intending to request\r\nthat he would himself appear and address his excited tenantry.\r\n\r\n'The moment I moved towards the door, the vast crowd leaped again to\r\ntheir feet; I was instantly surrounded, hustled, and prevented from\r\ngetting near it. I bore this good-humouredly, and the door being\r\nquite close to me, I had no doubt they would ultimately let me in. But\r\nwhilst this scene was going on, a shout was raised by those who were\r\nat a distance up the road leading to the town, and who had not heard\r\nwhat had been said. \"Bring him up--bring him up, and let us see him!\"\r\nIn a moment I was seized, and though I resisted to my utmost, I was\r\ndragged up the narrow road which led from Shirley House to the town. I\r\nwas kicked and beaten, and pushed and bruised, my hat knocked off, and\r\nmy clothes torn; and in this state I was dragged into the main street\r\nof Carrickmacross.\r\n\r\n'Here a scene of the wildest excitement took place, some cried one\r\nthing--some another. I was beaten again, my clothes torn off my back,\r\nand sticks whirled over my head. Four or five policemen met me as I\r\nwas being dragged along, but they might as well have attempted to\r\nstop the rushing of an Atlantic wave, as to stern the crowd that had\r\nassembled around me; _and they only looked on and let me pass_.'\r\n\r\nIf the sub-inspector, who was present, and his men acted in this\r\nmanner, I venture to say it is the only instance in the whole history\r\nof the force in which the Royal Irish constabulary were guilty of such\r\na cowardly neglect of duty. However, not only the police, but the best\r\npart of the crowd deserted this strange gentleman, and he was 'left\r\nin the hands of the vilest and most furious of the mob.' Where was Mr.\r\nShirley? Where were the clergy and the respectable inhabitants of the\r\ntown? The mob dragged him along towards Loughfea Castle--a mile and a\r\nhalf--whither they heard Mr. Shirley had fled, still beating, kicking,\r\nand strangling their victim, without any object; for how could they\r\nserve their cause by killing an agent who had never injured them? And\r\nhow easy it was to kill him if they wished! But here comes the climax;\r\nhe asked the murderous multitude to let him stop a few moments to\r\nbreathe--he then proceeds: 'I shall never forget that moment. I was\r\nthen about a mile from the town on the broad and open road leading to\r\nLoughfea Castle. I turned and looked around me, thinking my last\r\nhour was come, and anxious to see if there was one kind face, one\r\ncountenance, I had ever seen before, who could at least tell my\r\nfriends how I had died. But I looked in vain. The hills were crowded\r\nwith people. The long line of road was one mass of human beings,\r\nwhilst those immediately around me, mad with excitement, seemed only\r\nto thirst for my blood.\r\n\r\n'Having got a few moments' breathing-time, and seeing all appeal to\r\nbe vain, I turned again on my way, determined, however, to hold out\r\nto the last, as I felt that to fall or to faint must be certain death.\r\nJust then I became conscious of an able hand and a stout heart beside\r\nme, and I heard a whisper in my ear: \"They are determined to have your\r\nblood, but hold up, they shall have mine first.\" The speaker grasped\r\nmy arm firmly under his own, and walked on steadily by my side.\r\n\r\n'By this time I was _completely naked with the exception of my\r\ntrousers_. My coat, even my shirt, had been torn off, and I walked on,\r\nstill beaten and ill-treated, like a man to execution; my head bare,\r\nand _without any clothes from my waist upwards_. To increase the\r\nmisery of my situation, I found that my friend had been beaten and\r\ndragged away in spite of himself, and again I was left alone in the\r\nhands of those merciless men. I felt also I could now go no further,\r\nand that a last effort must be made before my senses left me from\r\nexhaustion. Stopping therefore once more, I asked to be led towards a\r\nhigh bank at the roadside, and leaning against this I turned and faced\r\nthose whom I now believed would soon become my murderers.\r\n\r\n'\"I can go no further,\" said I; \"what have you brought me here for?\r\nWhat do you want me to do?\" Again the same voice which I had first\r\nheard at the office, though I could not identify the speaker from the\r\nshouting and confusion around me, cried aloud, \"We want a reduction of\r\nour rents, will you promise to get us that?\"\r\n\r\n'There are times of instant danger, when it is said that the whole of\r\na man's past life rushes before him in the spaces of a single moment.\r\nIf ever there be such a time, this was such to me. I stood there,\r\nexhausted, without one friendly face on which to rest, and surrounded\r\nby _the worst of ten thousand men who seemed determined to have a\r\nvictim_. I knew and felt all this. So I said very quietly, as a last\r\neffort to save my life, and hoping they would name something I could\r\npromise to ask,\r\n\r\n'\"And what reduction will you be content with?\"\r\n\r\n'Again the same voice replied,\r\n\r\n'\"We will never pay more than one-half our present rents.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Then,\" said I, \"there ends the matter, _I never will promise that_.\"\r\n\r\n'There was a pause, and a dead silence. I stood _naked and bareheaded\r\nbefore them_. They stood opposite to me, with their sticks clenched in\r\ntheir hands, ready to strike. I looked at them, and they at me. They\r\nhesitated; _no one would strike me first_. I saw that they wavered,\r\nand instinctively, in a moment I _felt_ that I had won. This sudden\r\nrevulsion of feeling--though I was still externally motionless--sent\r\nthe blood throbbing to my temples with a rush that became almost\r\noppressive. But the strange pause continued--when at length a shout\r\nwas raised from the old stentorian voice again, \"Stand off, boys--for\r\nyour lives! no one shall harm him--he is a good man after all!\" and in\r\na moment I was surrounded by a new set of faces, who dashed furiously\r\ntowards me. They raised me on their shoulders, swept my old enemies\r\naway from me, procured me some water to drink, and carried me, now\r\ncompletely overcome, exhausted, and almost fainting, into the demesne\r\nof Loughfea.\r\n\r\n'Here again these suddenly converted friends desired me to get up on\r\na chair, and speak to the crowd now assembled before the castle. I did\r\nso. A reaction for the moment had taken place within me, and I felt\r\nsome return of strength.\r\n\r\n'I told the people I had never injured them. That it was a shame, and\r\na disgrace of which I had not believed any Irishman to be capable, to\r\ntreat a stranger as they had dealt with me that day. That in my own\r\ncountry I could have as many to fight for me as were now against me,\r\nand in short I abused them right heartily and soundly. They bore it\r\nwithout a murmur. My new friends cheered me vociferously, and I was\r\ncarried, now quite unable to walk, into the Castle of Loughfea. Mr.\r\nShirley's architect here appeared upon the scene, and perceiving that\r\nthe people were much exasperated at not finding Mr. Shirley at the\r\ncastle, and that some of the most violent were disposed in consequence\r\nto make a fresh attack upon me as I was being carried exhausted inside\r\nthe gates, he promised to speak to Mr. Shirley in their favour, and\r\nin some degree calmed their feelings. The excitement was past. Mr.\r\nShirley had not been there, and the people at last quietly dispersed.\r\n\r\n'In the evening I was conveyed in a covered carriage to\r\nCarrickmacross, blackened with bruises, stiff and sore, and scarcely\r\nable to stand--musing over the strange transactions which had happened\r\nthat day--and wrapped in a countryman's frieze coat which had been\r\nborrowed to cover _my nakedness_.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Realities of Irish Life, chap. v.]\r\n\r\nWhen the reader recovers his breath after this. I will ask him to turn\r\nto the history of this transaction--bad enough in itself--and see\r\nwhat fancy and art can do in dressing up a skeleton so that it becomes\r\n'beautiful for ever.' Mr. Trench himself shall be the historian,\r\nwriting to the authorities when the occurrences were all fresh in his\r\nmind. The narrative was handed in to the Devon commissioners as his\r\n_sworn evidence_:\r\n\r\n'_William Steuart Trench, esq., agent._\r\n\r\n'Have there been any agrarian outrages, and in what have they\r\noriginated?--There have been none, except _during a late short period\r\nof peculiar local excitement_.\r\n\r\n'Will you state the particulars of that excitement, and what then\r\noccurred?--I think my best mode of doing so will be by handing in\r\nthe copy of a letter which I addressed to a local magistrate for\r\nthe information of government.--[_The witness read the following\r\nletter_:--]\r\n\r\n'Dear Sir--In reply to your communication, enclosing a letter from Mr.\r\nLucas, requesting that I should give a statement of the particulars\r\nwhich occurred to me in Carrickmacross, on Monday last, I beg leave to\r\nlay before you the facts, as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. Shirley has recently appointed me to the agency over his Monaghan\r\nestate. We both arrived here on Thursday, the 30th of March, and on\r\nthe following morning we went together into the office; and having\r\nremained there about an hour, we were much surprised, on our return,\r\nto find an immense mass of people outside the door, who immediately\r\npresented a petition to Mr. Shirley, requesting a reduction of rent.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Shirley declined giving an immediate answer to such an unexpected\r\nrequest; but having read the petition, he told them he would give an\r\nanswer to it on the Monday following. By Saturday, however, he had\r\narrived at a full conclusion upon the point, and, anxious to avoid any\r\nunpleasant altercation with his tenants, he thought it advisable to\r\nlet his determination be known as soon as possible; and accordingly,\r\non Saturday, he issued and circulated a printed notice, stating the\r\ndetermination at which he had arrived, and declining any further\r\ncommunications upon the subject. I enclose a copy of the notice.\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding this notice, the people came in on Monday in immense\r\nnumbers; and at about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, the upper part of\r\nthe street opposite to Shirley House, where we were residing, was\r\nfilled with dense masses of men. I then thought it my duty to go out,\r\nand repeat to them in my capacity as agent, the determination at which\r\ntheir landlord had arrived. I did so in the mildest terms. I told them\r\nI had been able to go over only a part of the estate; but that from\r\nwhat I had seen, I was of opinion that a better system of farming\r\nand of general management of their land, was in my judgment much more\r\nrequired than a reduction of the rent. That I knew Mr. Shirley had the\r\nkindest feeling towards them, and that I was myself quite prepared and\r\nwilling to render them any assistance--to go to every man's farm, if\r\npossible, and to assist them by my counsel and advice. But that as Mr.\r\nShirley had come to a determination to make no present reduction in\r\nhis rental, I did expect that all who were able to pay their rents\r\nwould come in and do so; that the utmost leniency would be extended\r\ntowards those who could not pay; but that my duty was plain, and if\r\nthose who really were able to pay, refused to come forward and do\r\nso, that I had no alternative left but to take advantage of the power\r\nwhich the law afforded for the recovery of the rent--and this I was\r\nfully prepared and determined to do, if driven to that unpleasant\r\nnecessity. I also made some further observations, of less importance;\r\nbut my manner towards them was quiet and calm, and I expressed myself\r\nmost anxious to do everything in my power to promote their welfare and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n'_I then attempted to return to the house, across the street; but\r\nthe mob closed in upon me, and prevented my doing so_, _and with much\r\nviolence dragged me up into the town, where I was repeatedly struck\r\nand kicked, and nearly strangled, and my coat torn to pieces._\r\n\r\n'_The mob continued thus to ill-treat me for about a mile along the\r\nroad to Lough Fea, Mr. Shirley's residence, repeatedly kicking me,\r\nespecially when I showed symptoms of exhaustion, and pressing their\r\nhands violently upon my throat, till I was almost overcome by fatigue,\r\nheat and pain._\r\n\r\n'_All this appeared to be done for the purpose of forcing me to\r\npromise to induce Mr. Shirley to lower the rents to 10 s. per acre\r\n(upwards of fifty per cent.). This I refused to do. They then brought\r\nme on to Lough Fea, where they thought Mr. Shirley was; and upon not\r\nfinding him, they appeared much exasperated. Mr. Shirley's architect\r\nthen appeared, and by promising to speak to Mr. Shirley in their\r\nfavour, and by requesting them to send a deputation, instead of coming\r\nin a manner like the present, he induced them to desist from further\r\ninjury to me._\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Believe me, dear Sir, very truly yours,\r\n  '(Signed) 'WILLIAM STEUART TRENCH.\r\n\r\n  'Carrickmacross, April 8, 1844.\r\n\r\n'What has been the general demeanour of the people towards you since\r\nthat time?--Though they resisted my measures for the recovery of the\r\nrent, _to myself they have been perfectly civil; nor have I received\r\nany personal insult or unpleasantness, arising from the above cause\r\nsince that period._\r\n\r\n'How long did this kind of combination exist?--For about six months.'\r\n\r\nSetting aside the embellishments, let us note one or two differences\r\nas to facts. In the book the suddenly converted friends placed him on\r\na chair and asked him to make a speech before the castle door. He did\r\nso, and there is a grand statuesque picture of the hero, naked to the\r\nwaist, and standing on the chair as lofty pedestal. In the torn coat\r\nthe artist could never have made him look like Apollo. Even the shirt\r\nwould have been too commonplace; so off went the shirt. Three or four\r\ntimes attention is directed to the fact of the nakedness by the hero\r\nhimself, while the pencil of the filial illustrator has rendered him\r\nimmortal in this primitive costume. In his speech he 'abused them\r\nheartily and soundly.' Yet they cheered him vociferously, and then\r\ncarried him into the castle, where he could get nothing to cover his\r\nnakedness but a countryman's frieze coat. It was when he had been\r\ncheered vociferously, and kindly carried in, that Mr. Shirley's\r\narchitect appeared on the scene. Mr. Trench has not been just to that\r\ngentleman, for he really came to his rescue, and perhaps saved his\r\nlife, by giving the people the only sensible advice they got that day.\r\nIn his sworn statement, made twenty-five years ago, Mr. Trench said:\r\n'Mr. Shirley's architect then appeared, and by promising to speak\r\nto Mr. Shirley in their favour, and by requesting them to send a\r\ndeputation, instead of coming in a manner like the present, _he\r\ninduced them to desist from further injury to me._'\r\n\r\nIf we had contemporary accounts of all the other romantic scenes which\r\nhave fascinated so many readers, the 'Realities' would lose much\r\nof their gilding. Indeed, in most cases the internal evidence is\r\nsufficient to convince us that the sensationalist has been laying on\r\nhis colours pretty heavily. In the sketch of the Farney rent campaign,\r\nhowever, I am willing to accept Mr. Trench as a faithful historian. It\r\nis a most suggestive narrative, because it shows what mischief could\r\nbe done by driving the agricultural population to desperation. A\r\ngeneral strike against the payment of rent would convulse society.\r\nIf the war which raged in Farney had spread all over the island, the\r\nlandlords would be in serious difficulty. The British army might then\r\nhave become rent collectors, as they had been tithe collectors in\r\n1831.'\r\n\r\nMr. Shirley resolved, after much deliberation, to enforce his legal\r\nrights to the utmost. The bailiff was sent to warn the backward\r\ntenants to come in with the rent, and he everywhere received the same\r\nanswer--'We will pay no rent till our grievances are redressed.' Now\r\nall the missiles of the law were showered on the recusants--notices\r\nto quit, _latitats_, processes for arrears, &c. Grippers,\r\nprocess-servers, keepers, drivers, were in full requisition. The\r\ngrippers were to arrest all tenants against whom decrees had been\r\nobtained at the quarter-sessions; the keepers were employed to watch\r\nthe crops that had been seized; and the drivers were to bring the\r\ncattle, sheep, horses, or pigs to pound. These constituted the\r\nlandlord's army, having the police as a reserve, and the military if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the tenants organised a body called the 'Molly\r\nMaguires'--stout young men dressed up in women's clothes, their\r\nfaces disguised and besmeared in the most fantastic manner. These men\r\nwaylaid and maltreated the officers of the law so severely, that in a\r\nshort time no money could induce a gripper, process-server, driver or\r\nbailiff to show his nose on the estate. In this dilemma, Mr. Shirley,\r\nas commander-in-chief, ordered his lieutenant and his subordinates\r\nto go forth, with a body of police, and drive in all the cattle they\r\ncould seize on the lands of the defaulting tenants. The expedition\r\nstarted one fine morning, led on by the mounted bailiff, a fat man,\r\ntrembling like a hare at the thought of encountering the 'Molly\r\nMaguires.'\r\n\r\nMr. Trench's description of this foray is very graphic:--'No sooner\r\nhad this formidable party appeared upon the roads in the open country,\r\nthan the people rushed to the tops of the numerous hills with which\r\nthe district abounds; and as we moved forward, they ran from one hill\r\nto another shouting and cheering with wild defiant cries, and keeping\r\na line parallel to that in which our party was travelling.\r\n\r\n'The object of our expedition was clearly understood by the people;\r\nand the exact position of our company was indicated to those in\r\nthe lowlands by the movements of the parties on the hills; and\r\naccordingly, as we advanced, every beast belonging to every tenant who\r\nowed rent was housed or locked up, or driven somewhere away. Thus, as\r\nwe had no legal right to break open any door, or take any cattle out\r\nof any house, but only to seize those we might find in the open fields\r\nand upon the lands of the defaulting tenants, we soon perceived (as\r\nwe might have known before we started) that we were likely to return\r\nwithout success. The bailiff declared with a sigh, \"that not a hoof\r\nnor a horn was left in the whole country-side.\"\r\n\r\n'At length when about to return home, without having secured any\r\nbooty whatever, we came unexpectedly upon a poor little heifer calf,\r\nbrowsing quietly on the long grass beside a hedge. The bailiff having\r\nascertained that she was grazing on the land of a tenant who was\r\na defaulter, we seized upon the unhappy little beast, and drove it\r\ningloriously home to the pound at Carrickmacross, a distance of about\r\ntwo miles, amidst the jeers and laughter of the populace, at the\r\nresult of our formidable day's driving.'\r\n\r\nThus baffled, Mr. Shirley resolved to try another move.\r\n\r\nHe applied to the authorities in Dublin for an order for 'substitution\r\nof service.' That is, instead of delivering the legal notices at the\r\nhouses of the parties, which was impracticable, they were to be posted\r\nup on the chapel-door. To effect this object, a large police force\r\nwas necessary, and it was accompanied by a stipendiary magistrate. 'As\r\nsoon as the party came near the chapel grounds a shout of defiance was\r\nraised by the peasantry, who began to crowd into the chapel yard, and\r\nwith uplifted sticks and threatening gestures swore that they would\r\nnever allow the walls of the chapel to be desecrated by such a notice.\r\nThe bailiff, a most respectable and temperate man, did his utmost to\r\npacify the excited mob. He reasoned with them as best he could;\r\nand assured them that no desecration was intended--that he was only\r\ncarrying out the law, which required that the notice should be posted\r\non the chapel walls. But his voice had no more power than if he\r\nhad spoken to a storm of wind; they leaped and danced madly about,\r\nwhirling their sticks over their heads, and shouting that they would\r\nnever allow him to touch the sacred edifice.\r\n\r\n'The stipendiary magistrate now ordered him to do his duty, and that\r\nhe would be protected in doing it by the police, and he, trembling\r\nwith fear, as well he might, at length approached with the notice in\r\nhis hand to post it in due form. No sooner had he approached towards\r\nthe chapel than a volley of stones sent him staggering back, though\r\nnone actually struck him. The police were now ordered to advance. They\r\ndid so amidst another shower of stones. The storm of missiles still\r\ncontinuing and several of the police having been struck and injured,\r\nthey were at length ordered to fire. They aimed low, and directing\r\ntheir fire straight into the crowd of stone-throwers, they soon\r\nchecked the vigour of the assault--six or seven men fell under the\r\nvolley and rolled upon the ground. There was a short pause, a dead\r\nsilence ensued--but it was only for a moment, and before the police\r\ncould recover themselves and load again, a furious rush was made upon\r\nthem by the enraged populace. Stones were seen flying as thick\r\nas hail; and finally the police, apprehending that they must be\r\nannihilated if they remained, ran to their cars, which were waiting at\r\na little distance, and drove into Carrickmacross as fast as the horses\r\ncould gallop, accompanied by the stipendiary magistrate!\r\n\r\n'The field thus quickly won, remained in the possession of the\r\ninsurgents. One of the rioters was killed upon the spot--shot through\r\nthe body. The others who fell were only slightly injured; one had his\r\near taken off, another was wounded in the finger, another shot in the\r\narm.'\r\n\r\nThis was 'the battle of Magheracloon.' Mr. Trench wisely recommended\r\na cessation of hostilities till the harvest was gathered in, promising\r\nthe landlord that he would then by quiet means, acting on the tenants\r\nindividually and privately, induce them to pay their rents. He\r\nsucceeded, but as Mr. Shirley declined to adopt his plans for the\r\nbetter management of the estate, he resigned.\r\n\r\nHe came back, however, after some years, as agent to the Marquess of\r\nBath--a post which he occupies still, being manager-in-chief at the\r\nsame time of the large estates of the Marquess of Lansdowne, in Kerry,\r\nand Lord Digby, in the King's County. In all these undertakings,\r\nably assisted by his sons and his nephew, he has been pre-eminently\r\nsuccessful. If the Farney men had been driven off in 1843, or swept\r\naway by the famine, it would have been said that their fate was\r\ninevitable, nothing could be made of them. They were by nature prone\r\nto disorder and rebellion. Well, Lord Bath visited his estate in 1865.\r\nOn that occasion a banquet was given to the tenants, at which Mr.\r\nTrench made an eloquent speech. Referring to the outbreak in 1848, he\r\nsaid: 'And yet never, my Lord, never even in the worst of times, did I\r\nbate one jot of heart or hope in the noble people of Farney, never for\r\none moment did I doubt their loyalty to their Queen, their loyalty to\r\ntheir country, their respect for their landlord, and above all, that\r\nthey would be true and loyal to themselves.' So much for the incurable\r\nperversity of the Celtic race, for the 'black morass of Irish nature'\r\nthat can never be drained!\r\n\r\nThe people of Farney got justice, and they were contented and orderly.\r\nThey got security, and they were industrious and thriving. They\r\ngot protection under the constitution, and they were loyal. Densely\r\npeopled as the estate is, the agent could not coax one of them to\r\nemigrate; and after his former experience at Farney, he did not\r\nventure on eviction, though, no doubt, he would gladly repeat the\r\nKenmare experiment in thinning the masses with which he has had to\r\ndeal. Mr. Horsman, a prophet of the same school of economists, says\r\nthat Providence sent the famine to relieve the landlords, by carrying\r\naway a third of the population, and he seems to think it desirable\r\nthat another third should be got rid of somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nBELFAST AND PERPETUITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelfast, not being blessed with a cathedral like Armagh and Derry,\r\nis not called a 'city.' It is only a 'town;' but it is the capital of\r\nUlster, and surpasses all other places in Ireland in the rapidity of\r\nits progress and in its prosperity. It can boast but little of its\r\nantiquity. There is probably not a house in the borough more than 150\r\nyears old. The place is first noticed by history in 1178, merely as\r\nthe site of a fort of the O'Neills, which was destroyed by John De\r\nCourcy. It was only a poor village at the time of Bruce's invasion, in\r\n1315, though Spencer erroneously calls it 'a very good town.' It was\r\nso insignificant in 1586 that Holinshed does not mention it among the\r\ntowns and havens of Down and Antrim. Whatever town existed there had\r\nbeen destroyed by the Earl of Kildare when lord-deputy. In 1552 it was\r\nrepaired and garrisoned, and shortly after it was granted by the\r\ncrown to Hugh O'Neill of Clandeboye. In 1571 the castle, with a large\r\nportion of territory adjoining it, was bestowed upon Sir Thomas Smith\r\nand his son. The latter was assassinated by the 'wicked, barbarous,\r\nand uncivil people;' and the former, not being able to fulfil the\r\nconditions of his tenure, the district reverted with the whole earldom\r\nof Ulster to the crown in the reign of James I. Belfast was then\r\nsurrounded by extensive forests, abounding in fine timber for\r\nbuilding. The best specimen--perhaps the only one in the kingdom--of\r\na forest like what covered the country at that time, still exists at\r\nShane's Castle, the magnificent demesne of Lord O'Neill, where may be\r\nseen enormous oaks decaying with age, under whose shade probably the\r\nfamous Shane marshalled his galloglasse.\r\n\r\nIn 1613 the castle and manor of Belfast were granted to Sir Arthur\r\nChichester, lord-deputy, ancestor of the Marquis of Donegal, who did\r\nso much to effect the final conquest of Ulster. He may be said to\r\nbe the founder of the town. From the estates of his family, in\r\nDevonshire, and from Scotland, many families came over and made a\r\nstrong settlement here. Ultimately it became a corporation sending two\r\nmembers to the Irish Parliament. The chief magistrate was called 'the\r\nsovereign;' and the first who held the office was Thomas Pottinger,\r\nancestor of the celebrated Sir Henry Pottinger. In 1758 the population\r\nwas 8,549; in 1821, it was 37,000; in 1831, it was 53,000; in 1841, it\r\nhad increased to 75,000; in 1851, it amounted to 103,000; and the last\r\ncensus shows it to be 121,602. About 1,500 houses are built annually\r\nin the borough, and the present population is estimated at 150,000.\r\nThe rateable property is more than 394,000 l. The sum of 560,000 l.\r\nhas been spent on the harbour improvements, to which is to be added\r\n250,000 l. for building new docks. I remember the quays when they were\r\nsmall, irregular, inconvenient, dirty, and when the channel worked its\r\ndoubtful course through shifting masses of liquid mud, at low water.\r\nNow there are quays which extend in a line about a mile, covered\r\nwith spacious sheds for the protection of the goods being shipped\r\nand unshipped. There are docks of all sorts, and great shipbuilding\r\nestablishments standing on ground created out of the floating chaos\r\nof mud. 'Year by year,' as one of its poets has said, 'Belfast is\r\nchanging its aspect and overstepping its former boundaries, climbing\r\nthe hill-side, skirting the river margin, and even invading the sea's\r\nancient domain.\r\n\r\n  'Ambition's mistress of the fertile land,\r\n  Shuts out the ocean and usurps the strand.'\r\n\r\nAmong the 'usurpations' is Queen's Island, a beautiful people's\r\npark, standing in the midst of the Lough. The people of Belfast have\r\neffected all these vast improvements from their own resources,\r\nwithout a shilling from the lord of the soil, without any help from\r\nGovernment, except a loan of 100,000 l. from the Board of Works.\r\nBelfast is the 'linen capital' of the empire, as Manchester is the\r\n'cotton capital.' The linen trade was fostered in its infancy there\r\nby Strafford, and encouraged by William III., as a set-off against the\r\nabolition of the woollen trade. The first spinning of flax by steam\r\npower was commenced in 1830, by the Messrs. Mulholland, who employ\r\n2,000 hands, principally females. Mills have sprung up in every\r\ndirection, and it is estimated that they give employment to 15,000\r\npersons. To supply the consumption of flax, in addition to the home\r\nproduce, about 50,000 tons are imported every year. Linen is the\r\nstaple manufacture; but industrial arts of every kind flourish, with\r\nall the usual manifestations of wealth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter that the people of Londonderry, vexed\r\nthat the maiden city has been left so far behind her younger sister,\r\nascribe the difference to the fact that the Belfast manufacturers were\r\nfavoured with long building tenures. We hear it said often that the\r\nMarquis of Donegal gave his tenants perpetuity leases, implying that\r\nhe acted very liberally in doing so. If, however, you speak to persons\r\nacquainted with the local history, they will ascribe this advantage\r\nto 'Lord Donegal's necessities.' If you ask an explanation of this\r\nphrase, you will be told that towards the end of last century, and\r\nlater, Lord Donegal was obliged to adopt extraordinary methods\r\nfor raising money, and that the perpetuity leases in question were\r\npurchased, and at a very high rate too. You will further learn that\r\nthe tenants were compelled to take the leases, and pay heavy fines for\r\nthem in lump sums, and that if unable to produce the money they were\r\nevicted, and their farms were given to others who were able to pay. It\r\nis alleged that his agent got leases in blank, ready to be filled up\r\nwhen the cash was forthcoming, and that all the cash did not reach the\r\nlandlord's hands. At any rate, attempts have been made to break some\r\nof the leases. There has been long pending litigation on the subject.\r\nWhatever may be the defects of title on the part of the landlord,\r\nthe tenant must suffer. Dr. Hancock alludes to this fact in his\r\nfirst report. Referring to Sir John Romilly's Leasing Powers Bill, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n'The details of these Bills it is not necessary now to refer to; but\r\nthere was one principle provided for in them which has been neglected\r\nin subsequent measures. In the ordinary course of business a tenant\r\ndoes not investigate his landlord's title; the cost of doing so would\r\nbe nearly always too great; besides, the landlord would not think of\r\nconsenting to the investigation on every occasion of granting a lease.\r\nIt follows from this that it is a great hardship, if a flaw should\r\nbe discovered in a landlord's title, that leases granted before the\r\ntenants had any notice of the litigation should be bad. Take the\r\ncase of the estate which the late Duke of Wellington and Mr.\r\nLeslie recovered from Lord Dungannon after he had been for years in\r\npossession; or the case which is now pending for so many years between\r\nthe Marquis of Donegal and Viscount Templemore. Is it not a great\r\nhardship that leases which tenants took, trusting in the title of\r\nLord Dungannon or Viscount Templemore, who were then visible owners\r\nof great estates, should afterwards turn out to be worthless on some\r\npoint of law in title-deeds which they never had the opportunity of\r\nseeing; and which may be so subtle as to take Courts of Law years to\r\ndecide?'\r\n\r\nDr. Hancock says the principle that in such cases the tenant should\r\nbe protected, was neglected in subsequent measures. Now, what must the\r\ntenants think of legislation that subjects them to be robbed of their\r\ndearly-bought leases because of flaws, frauds or blunders with which\r\nthey could have nothing to do? The leases granted to the tenants of\r\nLord Donegal, however, in Belfast and the neighbourhood were generally\r\nvalid, and to these perpetuities we must undoubtedly ascribe the\r\nexistence of a middle class of remarkable independence of character,\r\nand the accumulation of capital for manufactures and commerce. Had\r\nLord Donegal been able to hold the town in a state of tutelage and\r\ndependence--had he been an 'improving landlord' of the modern type,\r\nwith an agent like Mr. Trench, so vigilant and curious that a dog\r\ncould not bark on the estate without his knowledge and consent,\r\nBelfast might have been far behind Derry to-day--as stationary as\r\nBangor, Hillsborough, Antrim, or Randalstown. Under such paternal care\r\nas Mr. Trench bestows upon tenants, with his omnipresent surveillance,\r\nthere could be no manly self-reliance, no freedom of speech or action,\r\nno enterprise. The agent would take care that no interests should grow\r\nup on the estate, which his chief could not control or knock down. It\r\nis not likely that Lord Donegal would have suffered the landscape to\r\nbe spoiled, the atmosphere of the deer park and gardens to be darkened\r\nand tainted by the smoke of factory chimneys, which could add nothing\r\nto his rental, while crowding around him the race which his great\r\nprogenitor did so much to extirpate. So Belfast may well be thankful\r\nthat the Marquis of Donegal, for some generations, could not afford to\r\nbe 'an improving landlord,' fond of paternal intermeddling with other\r\npeople's affairs, playing the part of Providence to an inferior race.\r\n\r\nBut there is one memorable fact connected with those perpetuity leases\r\nwhich applies more immediately to our purpose. The tenants who were\r\nevicted to make way for the men who had money to advance to the lord\r\nof the soil, feeling themselves seriously aggrieved, formed the first\r\nof the more modern agrarian combinations under the title of 'the\r\nHearts of Oak;' which continued for a long time to disturb the peace\r\nin Antrim and Down. The farms being extensively turned into pasture\r\nby the landlords and large graziers, there was no employment for the\r\nhouseless wanderers, no provision of any kind for their support.\r\nThey consequently had no respect for the rights of property, in\r\nthe vindication of which their homes had been demolished and their\r\nfamilies sacrificed, because they were not able to purchase fixity of\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, very fortunate for Belfast that the landlord was\r\nobliged to sell it; that the head of the great house founded by the\r\nconqueror of Ulster, enriched with territory so vast, should have been\r\nunder the necessity of giving a perpetual property in the soil to\r\nsome of the sons of industry. By that simple concession he did more to\r\nadvance the prosperity of the town, than could have been accomplished\r\nby centuries of fostering care, under the shadow of feudalism. Belfast\r\nshows, on a grand scale, what might be done on many an estate in\r\nIreland, in many a town and village where the people are pining away\r\nin hopeless misery, if the iron bonds of primogeniture and entail\r\nwhich now cramp landed property were struck off. The Greek philosopher\r\ndeclared that if he had a standing-place he could move the earth. Give\r\nto capital the ground of perpetuity of tenure, whereon to plant\r\nits machinery, and it will soon lift this island from the slough of\r\ndespond. Then may it be said more truly than Grattan said it in 1782,\r\nthat Ireland had got nearer to the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLEASE-BREAKING--GEASHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Manor of Geashill in the King's County furnishes\r\nanother instructive illustration of the land question and of the\r\neffect upon the people of the system of management, under the new\r\nschool of agents, of which Mr. Steuart Trench may be regarded as the\r\nbrightest ornament, if not the apostle. The epoch was favourable for\r\nhis mission, and he was the man for the epoch; he had been quietly\r\ntraining himself for the restoration of disordered estates, and the\r\ncritical emergencies of the times thrust him into the front rank of\r\nsocial reformers. When he describes the wonderful revolutions wrought\r\nby his instrumentality, the whirlwinds on which he rode, the storms\r\nwhich he directed and quelled, the chaos out of which he evoked order,\r\nhe assumes that the hurricane and the chaos were the normal state of\r\nthings. A mysterious pestilence had blighted the principal food of\r\nthe people for two or three years, and brought on a desolating famine.\r\nMillions perished by that visitation chiefly because the legislature\r\nhad persistently refused up to that period to make any provision for\r\nthe Irish poor such as it had made centuries before for the English\r\npoor, and because no care had been taken to distribute the population\r\nover the waste lands which their labour would have reclaimed and\r\nfertilized; or to improve their position, so that they might not be\r\nwholly dependent on one sort of food, and that the most precarious and\r\nperishable. Mr. Sadler, in his work on Population, had proved that,\r\neven in the case of Ireland before the famine, there was really no\r\n'surplus population;' that if the resources of the country had been\r\ndeveloped by a wise Government, sympathising with the people, the text\r\nwhich he adopted would have been applicable there: 'Dwell in the land,\r\nand verily ye shall be fed.' There was hasty legislation to meet the\r\nemergency, but in all the haste, the heartless economists found time\r\nto devise clauses and provisions, by means of which, when the small\r\nfarmers had consumed all their stock to keep their families alive,\r\nthey were compelled to relinquish their holdings in order to get food\r\nfor their famishing children. They must submit to the workhouse test,\r\nthey must not hold more than a quarter of an acre of land, if they\r\nwould get relief. Under the dire instigation of hunger, in the\r\nstupor and recklessness of their misery, they accepted any terms the\r\nlandlords chose to impose, and so whole villages disappeared from the\r\nlandscape, swept off with the besom of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe political economists (all the new school of land-agents are rigid\r\npolitical economists), taught by their prophet Malthus, ascribed the\r\nfamine and every other social evil to surplus population, and to the\r\nincurably lazy and thriftless habits of the Celtic race. According to\r\nthem the potato blight had only hastened an inevitable catastrophe.\r\nTherefore they set to work with all their agencies and all their\r\nmight to get rid of the too prolific race, and to supplant the native\r\ncultivators by British settlers and wealthy graziers.\r\n\r\nThis has been done ever since by a quiet and gradual process,\r\nsteadily, systematically, inexorably, propelled by many powerful\r\ntendencies of the age, and checked only by assassination. What are the\r\nagrarian outrages which have become so terribly rife of late, but the\r\ndesperate struggles of a doomed race to break the instruments which\r\npluck them out of their native soil? A generation of instruction in\r\nthe national schools and a generation of intercourse with the\r\nfree citizens of the United States, who call no man 'master' under\r\nheaven--have taught them that it is an enormous iniquity to sacrifice\r\nhumanity to property, to make the happiness, the freedom, the very\r\nexistence of human beings, secondary to the arbitrary power and\r\nself-interest of a small class called landlords. They regard the\r\n'improving landlord' system as nothing but a legal and civilised\r\ncontinuation of the barbarous policy of extermination by fire and\r\nsword which we have seen pursued so ruthlessly in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It is still the land-war, conducted according to modern\r\ntactics, aiming with deadly effect at the same object, the slow but\r\nsure destruction of a nuisance called the 'Celtic race.' This may be\r\na delusion on their part; but it is the deep-rooted conviction of\r\npriests and people, and hence the utter inadequacy of any enactment\r\nwhich will not render such a policy impossible, by making the tenure\r\nof the occupiers independent of the will of the landlords. Until such\r\ntime the peasantry will continue to offer a bloody resistance to the\r\nlegal attempts to crush them out of the country.\r\n\r\nIn this self-defensive war, they cannot cope with the armed power\r\nof England in the open field; and they are driven upon the criminal\r\nresource of the oppressed in all ages and all lands--secret\r\ncombination and assassination. For this crime they feel no remorse;\r\nfirst, because it is _war_--just as the soldier feels no remorse\r\nfor killing the enemy in a battle; and, secondly, because their\r\nconquerors, and the successors of those conquerors, have taught them\r\ntoo well by repeated examples the terrible lesson of making light of\r\nhuman life. Poor ignorant creatures, they cannot see that, while\r\nthe most illustrious noblemen in England won applause and honours\r\nby shooting down Irish women and children like seals or otters,\r\nthe survivors of the murdered people should be execrated as cruel,\r\nbarbarous, and infamous for shooting the men that pull down the\r\nrooftrees over the heads of their helpless families and trample upon\r\ntheir household gods. These convictions of theirs are very revolting\r\nto our feelings, but they are facts; and as facts the legislature must\r\ndeal with them. If there be a people, otherwise singularly free from\r\ncrime, who regard the assassination of the members of a certain\r\nclass with indifference, or approbation, the phenomenon is one which\r\npolitical philosophy ought to be able to explain, and one which cannot\r\nbe got rid of by suspending the constitution and bringing railing\r\naccusations against the nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Trench speaks with something like contempt or pity of 'good\r\nlandlords,' a class which he contradistinguishes from 'improving\r\nlandlords.' But it should be remembered that by this last phrase he\r\nalways means agents of the Trench stamp. For he observes that the\r\nlandlord himself cannot possibly do much more than authorize his agent\r\nto do what he thinks best; and it is rather an advantage that the\r\nproprietor should be an absentee, otherwise his good nature might\r\nprompt him to interrupt the work of improvement. Now there is this to\r\nbe said of the good landlords, who may be counted by hundreds, and who\r\nare found in all the counties of Ireland. Their estates are free from\r\nthe 'poetic turbulence' in which Mr. Trench is the 'stormy petrel.'\r\nThey preserved their tenants through the years of famine, and have\r\nthem still on their estates. Nor should the fact be omitted that among\r\nthose good landlords, who abhor the idea of evicting their tenants,\r\nare to be found the lineal descendants of some of the most cruel\r\nexterminators of the seventeenth century. Their goodness has\r\ncompletely obliterated, among their people, the bitter memories of the\r\npast. The present race of Celts would die for the men whose ancestors\r\nshot down their forefathers as vermin. But the improving landlords run\r\ntheir ploughshares through the ashes of old animosities, turning up\r\nembers which the winds of agitation blow into flames. We seldom hear\r\nof Ribbonism till the improving agent comes upon the scene, warring\r\nagainst natural rights, warring against the natural affections,\r\nwarring against humanity, warring against the soul.\r\n\r\nThese remarks bring us to the case of the barony of Geashill, the\r\nestate of Lord Digby, to which Mr. Trench became agent in 1857. Lord\r\nDigby desired to obtain his services, but he did not communicate his\r\ndesire to Mr. Trench himself, though nothing would seem easier. It was\r\nfirst conveyed by Lieut.-General Porter, the confidential friend of\r\nLord Digby, and next by Mr. Brewster, afterwards Lord Chancellor of\r\nIreland. When the police received a notice that the new landlord of\r\nGeashill would certainly meet with a 'bloody death' if he persisted in\r\nhis threatened dealings with the tenants, there was no more time\r\nfor diplomatic delicacy in approaching Mr. Trench. The landlord's\r\nextremity is Mr. Trench's opportunity. When leases are to be broken,\r\nwhen independent rights are to be extinguished, or 'contracted away,'\r\nwhen an overcrowded estate is to be thinned at the least possible\r\ncost to the owner, when a rebellious tenantry are to be subdued, and\r\nRibbonmen are to be banished or hanged, Mr. Trench is the man to do\r\nthe work of improvement. He admits that he never had before him an\r\nuglier job than this at Geashill, and he had the worst apprehensions\r\nas to the danger of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing less than to break 120 leases, which had been granted\r\nfrom time to time by the late Lord Digby during the sixty years that\r\nhe had enjoyed the property. The value of these leases was 30,600 l.,\r\nfor the terms unexpired after his death. Among those 120 leaseholders\r\nwere the descendants of English settlers, gentlemen farmers, one of\r\nthem a magistrate, and a number of substantial yeomen, the sort of men\r\nthe country so much wanted to form an independent middle class. But to\r\nan 'improving landlord,' the existence of such a class on his estate\r\nis intolerable. At all hazards they must be made tenants-at-will, and\r\nbrought completely under his control.\r\n\r\nThey had built houses and planted trees; they had reclaimed the deep\r\nbog and converted it into good arable land. They had employed the\r\npeasantry, and given them plots of ground, and, more than all, they\r\nhad allowed a number of families to squat on bits of bog by the\r\nroadside, where they lived as well as they could; working when\r\nthere was a demand for labour, cutting turf and selling it in the\r\nneighbouring town of Tullamore, and perhaps carrying on some little\r\ndealings. At all events they had survived the famine; and there they\r\nwere in 1857 with their huts standing on their 'estates,' for they had\r\npaid no rent for twenty years, and they had as good a title in law\r\nas Lord Digby himself. Mr. Trench seems to have been horrified at\r\nnot finding the names of these householders in the rent-books of the\r\nestate! The idea!--that there should be within the four corners of the\r\nKing's County, even on the bog of Allen, a number of natives holding\r\nland, without a landlord! It was monstrous. But as they could not be\r\nevicted for non-title, they were all severally tempted by the offer\r\nof money, in sums varying from 5 l. to 20 l. each, to sell their\r\nfreeholds to the landlord. Pity they were not preserved as a remnant\r\nof the antediluvian period, ere the ancient tenures were merged in\r\nfloods of blood. Like a bit of primitive forest, they would be more\r\ninteresting to some minds than the finest modern plantation.\r\n\r\nIt was not so easy to deal with the 120 leaseholders. To what extent\r\nthey had improved their farms before they got the leases, Mr. Trench\r\ndoes not say. But as the absentee landlord had done nothing, and spent\r\nnothing, whatever increase to the value had been made was undoubtedly\r\nthe work of the tenants; and after the leases were obtained, they\r\nwould naturally feel more confidence in the investment of their\r\nsavings in the land. However that may be, a professional man, employed\r\nby Lord Digby, estimated the value over and above the reserved rent\r\nat 30,600 l., which sum the new landlord proposed to put into his own\r\npocket, by increasing the rent one-third. The plea for this sweeping\r\nconfiscation was, that the late Lord Digby, cousin to the present, had\r\nonly a life interest in the Irish estate, and therefore, the leases\r\nwere all illegal and worthless. Accordingly the new lord commenced\r\nproceedings to evict the whole of the tenantry for non-title. They\r\nwere astounded. They held meetings; they deliberated; they appealed to\r\nthe landlord; they appealed to the executors of the late peer, who\r\nhad large estates in England, and died worth a million sterling in\r\nthe funds, all of which he willed away from the heir of his title and\r\nIrish estates. Says Mr. Trench:--\r\n\r\n'It may readily be supposed that circumstances so peculiar as these\r\ncreated considerable anxiety in the district. The tenantry, _many_ of\r\nthem large and respectable land-holders, now learned, for the first\r\ntime, that their leases were good for nothing in law. They had been\r\nduly 'signed, sealed, and delivered' to them under a full belief on\r\ntheir part that the contract was not only just and honourable, but\r\nalso perfectly legal; and their feelings may be imagined when they\r\nfound that they were suddenly threatened with a total loss of the\r\nproperty which they had always looked upon as secure.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'Realities of Irish Life,' p.314.]\r\n\r\nPending the ejectment proceedings, they were knocked about from post\r\nto pillar, without getting any satisfaction. The landlord referred\r\nthem to the executors, although he knew well they had no legal claim\r\non them whatever, and that to legal claims only could they pay any\r\nattention. The executors again referred them to their landlord, who\r\nwas determined to break the leases, come what would. Now, if the Irish\r\nlaw regulating the relations of landlord and tenant were based upon\r\njustice and equity, the wrong done by the late earl, if any, was a\r\nwrong for which the tenants should in no way be held responsible. The\r\nwrong was done to the heir-at-law. To him, and not to the tenants,\r\ncompensation should have been made by the executors. And after all, it\r\nwas really to him that the money was advanced to buy up the leases,\r\nin order to save him from assassination, for the tenants had no legal\r\nclaim upon them.\r\n\r\nThe natural, proper, and honest course, then, for the landlord, was to\r\nhave kept the 30,600 l. as compensation to himself for the mistake\r\nof his predecessor, and to let the leases stand. If he considered\r\nthe peace of the country, if he wished to inspire in the minds of\r\nthe people respect for the rights of property, or confidence in the\r\nGovernment, he would not have adopted the desperate course of breaking\r\n120 contracts, kindling the flames of agitation, and planting Ribbon\r\nlodges all over a district hitherto peaceful and tranquil. But he was\r\nbent on crushing the independent yeomanry into the abject condition\r\nof tenants-at-will. To carry out this purpose, Mr. Trench was\r\nindispensable. He knew how to tame the wild Irish. And Mr. Trench was\r\nequal to the occasion. He went to reside a few weeks at Tullamore, to\r\nreconnoitre the enemy's position. He writes as if this was the first\r\ntime he made acquaintance with the estate. But his own residence\r\nwas in the Queen's County, not far off; and there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that he knew all about Geashill long before; and all about\r\nevery estate belonging to an English absentee in the four provinces;\r\nfor he had, growing up around him, a young generation of land-agents,\r\ntrained in all the arts of modern management, and one of the ablest\r\nof these, his son, Mr. T.W. Trench, became his partner in this agency.\r\nMr. Trench's tactics are not new, though he excels all men in their\r\nskilful application. His plan, adopted on all occasions, is to divide\r\nand conquer. Violent measures being dangerous and contrary to his\r\nown feelings, he trusts to diplomacy, dealing with individuals,\r\ntaken separately into a private room, where his irresistible personal\r\nfascination invariably brings matters to a satisfactory issue.\r\n\r\nIn this case, he went over to the English executors, and persuaded\r\nthem to advance the 30,600 l. to be distributed among the tenants,\r\nunder the guarantee of Lord Digby that this sum would cover all\r\npossible claims. Thus provided with funds, he summoned the tenants,\r\nnot all, but ten of the most influential, to meet him at Geashill. He\r\nleft this meeting, purposely, to the last day and the last hour, as a\r\npiece of generalship. He says:--\r\n\r\n'They appeared puzzled and anxious, and very uncertain what to do. At\r\nlength one of them proposed that they should do nothing until they had\r\nhad an opportunity of consulting the remainder of the leaseholders, of\r\nwhom there were upwards of 120 upon the estate.\r\n\r\n'\"No,\" replied I, \"you must come to a decision now; there is a\r\nmessenger at the door on horseback, to ride to the telegraph station\r\nat Portarlington to stop the English witnesses coming over. This must\r\nbe done within an hour, or they will start for Ireland, and _then_ it\r\nwill be out of my power to stop the lawsuit. You must determine _now_,\r\neach man for himself, or the lawsuit must go on.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Will you state the amount of money you will give to each of us?\"\r\nasked one of the party.\r\n\r\n'\"Certainly,\" replied I, \"if you will _each come separately with me\r\ninto another room_.\"\r\n\r\n'They did so. I named to each an amount something less than the sum\r\nset down by the notary, partly as a reserve, lest any tenants holding\r\nunder these leaseholders should afterwards require to be paid, and\r\npartly lest it might be supposed we were yielding to a legal claim\r\nalready granted. After a little consideration, they all severally\r\nsigned the consent for judgment.'\r\n\r\nThe other leaseholders followed. The leases were all surrendered, and\r\nthe holders became tenants-at-will. I had the pleasure of meeting one\r\nof the most influential of them a short time ago at Geashill--a fine\r\ntall, patriarchal-looking gentleman, the representative of one of the\r\nEnglish settlers. He was waiting about humbly and patiently for an\r\nopportunity of speaking to the young agent, who is as courteous and\r\nkind as he is efficient. But I could not help reflecting how different\r\nwould be the bearing of the tenant if he had been still in possession\r\nof his lease! His dwelling-house was not as grand as the stylish villa\r\nwhich the landlord has erected beside it. But every stick and stone\r\nabout the place were his own property. So also were the old timber\r\ntrees, which his ancestors planted. But now every stick and stone\r\nand tree belong to Lord Digby, and as such the agent exhibits them to\r\nvisitors--the buildings, the gardens, the trees, the hedges, the rich\r\npasture fields, all having such a look of comfort and independence. I\r\nasked, 'Did you ever know a place like this old home of yours to have\r\nbeen made by a tenant-at-will?' He answered in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe tenant on an 'improved estate' must be very careful about his\r\nspeech. An agent has a hundred eyes and a hundred ears. People who\r\nseek 'favours' at the office, find it useful to be spies upon their\r\nneighbours, to detect violations of the 'rules of the estate.' It is\r\nmainly through the spy-system that Mr. Steuart Trench, according to\r\nhis own avowal, won most of his victories over refractory tenants. For\r\nexample, on this estate he had a woman acting as a spy at the meetings\r\nof the Ribbonmen; and he boasted that a dog could not bark at Farney\r\nwithout his knowledge. I refer to this matter here again for the\r\npurpose of saying that I cannot regard as an improvement of the\r\ncountry a system which establishes a despot on every estate, which\r\ndegrades the tenant into a day-labourer, which--land being limited and\r\nscarce--substitutes the old, barbarous, pastoral system for tillage,\r\nwhich banishes the poor and enslaves the rich. Lord Digby levelled\r\ncottages, gardens, farms, manured the land, got an enormous crop,\r\nwhich in one year paid all the expenses; and then laid out the land in\r\nvast tracts of pasture, for which he gets from 30 s. to 40 s. an acre.\r\nThat is improvement for _him_, but not for the people, not for the\r\ncountry, not for the state, not for the Queen. It may crush Ribbonism.\r\nBut for every Ribbonman crushed, a hundred Fenians spring up; and\r\ndisaffection becomes not a mere local plague, but an endemic. Mr.\r\nTrench gives a significant hint to other landlords to follow the\r\nexample of Lord Digby, assuring them that it will '_pay_.'\r\n\r\nA still more flagrant case of lease-breaking occurred some years ago\r\nin the county of Galway. Dr. Hancock has put the facts of this case\r\nbefore the Government in his recent report:--\r\n\r\n'The plaintiff was the Rev. Dr. O'Fay, parish priest of Craughwell, in\r\nthe county of Galway, and the defendant the landlord on whose estate\r\nthe priest resided. About ten years ago the priest was induced to\r\ntake a farm that had been held by a former parish priest; the previous\r\nproprietor, the father of the defendant, promising a lease for three\r\nlives, or thirty-one years. After the priest entered into possession\r\nthe landlord ascertained that he could not fulfil his promise.\r\n\r\n'As he did not possess such a power under the terms of the estate\r\nsettlement, he offered, instead, a lease for the priest's own\r\nlife, and 20 l. to aid in building a house. The priest continued\r\nin possession of the farm, and paid the rent agreed on, thus, as he\r\nalleged, accepting the arrangement proposed. He was on excellent terms\r\nwith the landlord, and expended 70 l. in permanent improvements, and\r\ndid not ask for the 20 l. which the landlord had promised. In 1854 the\r\nlandlord died, and his son, the defendant, succeeded to the property.\r\nHe gave notice to all his yearly tenants of an intention to raise\r\ntheir rents. The priest claimed to have a promise of a lease, and the\r\nagent of the property, during the landlord's absence abroad, admitted\r\nthis claim, and did not raise the rent. The landlord said he had no\r\nnotice of his father's promise; he, however, allowed the priest to\r\nremain in possession, and the priest expended 400 l. in buildings, on\r\nthe faith that he would not be disturbed. A dispute subsequently arose\r\nabout trespass, and the fences on the boundary between the priest's\r\nfarm and some land in the possession of the landlord. The landlord\r\nserved notice to quit, and brought an ejectment. After some delay\r\njudgment was given in his favour, subject to an application to the\r\nCourt of Chancery to compel him to fulfil his father's promise of a\r\nlease.'\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Rolls thus characterised the law which justifies the\r\nrobbery of the tenants by unscrupulous and vindictive landlords:--\r\n\r\n'Even if the Rev. Dr. O'Fay had no claim except as tenant from year to\r\nyear, I have no hesitation in stating that, although in point of law\r\non the authorities I have referred to, and particularly the case of\r\nFelling _v._ Armitage, the petitioner's suit could not be sustained,\r\n_yet noticing can be more repugnant to the principles of natural\r\njustice than that a landlord should look on at a great expenditure\r\ncarried on by a tenant from year to year, without warning the tenant\r\nof his intention to turn him out of possession_. The defendant's offer\r\nto allow Dr. O'Fay to remove the buildings was a mockery. _I have no\r\njurisdiction to administer equity in the natural sense of that term,\r\nor I should have no difficulty whatever in making a decree against the\r\ndefendant._ I am bound to administer an artificial system, established\r\nby the decisions of eminent judges, such as Lord Eldon and Sir William\r\nGrant, and _being so bound, I regret much that I must administer\r\ninjustice in this case, and dismiss the petition_, but I shall dismiss\r\nit without costs. _I should be very glad for the sake of justice that\r\nmy decision should be reversed by the Court of Appeal._'\r\n\r\nLest it might be supposed that this was the opinion of a single judge,\r\nwe find in the Court of Appeal equally strong views stated:--It\r\nwas thrown out that it was a case for amicable settlement, but the\r\nrespondent's counsel assured the Court that his client 'had resolved\r\nto spend his fortune, if necessary, in resisting the claim of the\r\nRev. Dr. O'Fay.' Lord Justice Blackburne pronounced this to be a very\r\nirrational determination, although he had to decide that the claim\r\ncould not be sustained in law or equity.\r\n\r\nLord Chancellor Napier, in concluding his judgment, said:--\r\n\r\n'I think I am not overstepping my duty in suggesting to the\r\nrespondent, that, under all the circumstances of this case, he will\r\nbest maintain the character and honour of a British officer, satisfy\r\nthe exigencies of justice, and uphold the rights of property, by\r\nmaking _such an arrangement_ with Dr. O'Fay, as to the possession of\r\nthis farm, _as may leave him the full benefit of an expenditure made\r\nin good faith, and with the reasonable expectation of having the full\r\nbenefit of it sufficiently secured by an undisturbed possession_.'\r\n\r\nIt is a favourite theory with the new school of agents and improving\r\nlandlords, that long leases cause bad cultivation; in other words,\r\nthat industry prospers best where there is no security that you can\r\nreap what you have sown, except the honour of a man whose interest it\r\nis to appropriate the fruits of your labours, which he can _legally_\r\ndo. Now, in every class and profession, there are failures,--persons\r\nthat are good for nothing, indolent, improvident, and thriftless. If\r\nsuch a man has a long lease at a low rent, he may be overwhelmed in\r\ndebt, and leave his land in very bad condition. Others may imitate\r\ntheir aristocratic superiors in their contempt for labour and their\r\nhabits of expenditure, and so get into a state of hopeless poverty on\r\na good estate. If there are cases where industrious sober men are the\r\nworse for having an old lease, it should be remembered that the most\r\ninsecure of all tenures is a lease dependent on a single bad life,\r\nwhich may drop at any hour. But there are other causes of the facts\r\nurged against long tenures, for which the legislature is responsible,\r\nnot the unimproving tenant. Dr. Hancock explains this point very\r\nsatisfactorily:--\r\n\r\n'Instances of bad cultivation and neglect of improvements, where long\r\nleases exist, are sometimes brought forward to show the inutility of\r\ntenure as a security for capital, and the strange economic theory\r\nis propounded that a precarious interest is more favourable to the\r\ninvestment of capital than a secure one. As well might the state of\r\nlanded property in Ireland before the Incumbered Estates Court was\r\nestablished be adduced as an argument against property in land. The\r\nremedy, however, which the legislature applied to incumbered estates\r\nof large proprietors was not to destroy property in land, but simply\r\nto secure its prompt, cheap, and effectual transfer to solvent hands.\r\n\r\n'For tenants' interests under leases where the value is small, and\r\nwhere the interests have become complicated, the Landed Estates\r\nCourt is too expensive, and so these interests remain often for years\r\nuntransferred, in the hands of some one who has a very limited and\r\noften uncertain interest in them. Such a leaseholder is deterred from\r\nmaking improvements by the state of the law which deprives him of the\r\nentire value of his improvements if anyone should disturb him under\r\na prior charge or claim, however obscure or unknown, affecting his\r\ninterest. The remedy is to be found in an extension of the principle\r\nof the Record of Title Act to the local registry of small leasehold\r\ninterests, and in the providing for the local sale of such interests\r\nin a cheap manner, with an absolute title.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAND SYSTEM AND THE WORKING CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been told over and over again that the business of Ireland,\r\nand all its improvements, requiring education and integrity, are\r\ncarried on 'by the Protestants, by whose intelligence, and labour,\r\nmental and bodily, its prosperity, such as it is, has been produced.'\r\nThis assertion has been made with great confidence, by many writers\r\nand speakers. It is a gross exaggeration, and absurd as it is gross. I\r\nsay nothing of the unseemly egotism of a dominant caste, thus parading\r\nits own merits, flaunting its plumes, strutting and crowing over the\r\ncommon folk--of this pharisaic spirit of the ascendant Protestant,\r\nstanding close to the altar, reciting to God and the world the number\r\nof his resplendent virtues, and scornfully contrasting his excellent\r\nmoral condition with the degraded Catholic--the vile publican and\r\nsinner, overwhelmed with enormous guilt. These monopolising Pharisees,\r\nwho laboured at such a rate to assert their natural superiority, as\r\nthe favourites of Heaven, and members of the Sovereign's church, over\r\na race which England enabled them to subjugate and impoverish, have\r\nfound no trumpeter so loud as Master Fitzgibbon, a chancery judge. In\r\nthe same spirit the last census has been analysed by one of the ablest\r\ndefenders of the Irish establishment, the Rev. Dr. Hume, of Liverpool,\r\nin order to prove that everything good in Ireland has been done by\r\nthe Protestants, and everything bad by the Catholics. But he does not\r\nstate fairly the conditions of the race. He does not state that one of\r\nthe competitors had been master for centuries, well-fed, well-trained,\r\npossessed of all advantages which give strength, skill, courage, and\r\nconfidence, while the other was ill-fed, untrained, enfeebled, and\r\n_over-weighted_, having to work out of himself the slavish spirit\r\nwhich oppression had produced, and to gain, by extra efforts, the\r\nskill which the law had forbidden him to acquire. Nevertheless the\r\nCatholics have acquired skill, and the extent to which the empire is\r\ndependent on their knowledge of the industrial arts is much greater\r\nthan many people suppose. Of the farming class in Ireland, 76 per\r\ncent. are Roman Catholics. But we are indebted to the obnoxious race\r\nin other respects than as producers of food.\r\n\r\nFrom the classification of occupations and professions, we learn that\r\nthe Roman Catholics bear the following proportions to the Protestants\r\nof all denominations.\r\n\r\nPersons employed in the manufacture of:          Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nSkin clothing                                      .77 per cent.\r\nWoollen do.                                        .88    \"\r\nFlax do.                                           .43    \"\r\nCotton do.                                         .53    \"\r\nStraw do.                                          .66    \"\r\nSilk do.                                           .66    \"\r\nMiscellaneous do.                                  .67    \"\r\nIn producing furniture                             .84    \"\r\nIn unclassed industrial employments                .84    \"\r\nIn amusements                                      .80    \"\r\nIn architecture                                    .78    \"\r\nIn making machinery                                .76    \"\r\nIn conveyance and travelling                       .73    \"\r\nIn literature and education                        .56    \"\r\nIn charity and benevolence                         .52    \"\r\nIn health                                          .50    \"\r\nIn science and art                                 .47    \"\r\nIn justice and government                          .46    \"\r\nIn banking and agency                              .40    \"\r\n\r\nThere are other suggestive figures in the census, bearing on\r\nthis question. While three-fourths of the farmers are Catholics,\r\nthree-fourths of the land-agents are Protestants, who, as a rule,\r\nhave an unconquerable antipathy to the Catholic clergy, as the only\r\nobstacle to their absolute power over the tenants, with whom they find\r\nit hard to sympathise. Of farm labourers and domestic servants, nine\r\nout of ten belong to the race supposed by some to be incapable of\r\nvirtue and loyalty. Again, of the whole British army of all ranks, 37\r\nper cent. are Irishmen, and of these Irish soldiers, 67 per cent. are\r\nCatholics. More than three-fourths of the magistrates are Protestants;\r\nand they bear about the same proportion on the grand juries. According\r\nto the theory and practice of the constitution, all power, legislative\r\nand administrative, must be based on the ownership of land. The\r\nrate-payers have a voice indeed, but it is generally nothing but\r\nan echo of the landlord's voice; what else can it be when they are\r\ntenants-at-will, depending on the mercy of the proprietor for the\r\nmeans of existence? In county offices, the Protestants have an\r\noverwhelming majority. It is the same in all the offices filled by\r\ngovernment patronage, except the judges of the superior courts. There\r\nCatholics are in the majority, because they had obtained seats in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nOn the boards of guardians the mass of the poor might expect that\r\na majority of guardians would be prompted by national and religious\r\nfeeling to sympathise with them, so that they would find in the master\r\nand matron, the doctor and the relieving officer, something like the\r\nnatural tenderness which a common kindred and creed inspire. But half\r\nthe guardians are _ex-officio_ members, as magistrates; nearly all\r\nlandlords and Protestants. They have in addition 'property votes,' and\r\n'residence votes;' so that, with their influence over the elections,\r\nthey are generally able to pack the board; and in that case the\r\nofficials are almost invariably Protestants and conservatives. I know\r\na union in which three-fourths of the rate-payers are Roman Catholics;\r\nand yet, with the utmost efforts of the priests, they were not able to\r\nelect a single Catholic guardian. To meet the landlord pressure,\r\nsome of the rate-payers were required to sign their voting papers in\r\npresence of their pastors, yet so terrible was that pressure that they\r\nafterwards took them to the agent's office, and, to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure, tore them up before his face. I have been told by a\r\npriest, that such is the mortal dread of eviction, or of a permanent\r\nfine in the form of increased rent, that he had known tenants who,\r\nwhen produced in the witness-box, denied on oath acts of oppression of\r\nwhich they had been bitterly complaining to himself, and which he well\r\nknew to be facts.\r\n\r\nThus the land-war rages at every board of guardians, in every\r\ndispensary, in every grand jury room, at every petty sessions,\r\nin every county court, in every public institution throughout the\r\nkingdom. The land-agent is the commanding officer, his office is a\r\ngarrison, dominating the surrounding district. He is able, in most\r\ncases, to defy the confessional and the altar; because he wields\r\nan engine of terror generally more powerful over the mind of the\r\npeasantry than the terrors of the world to come. Armed with the 'rules\r\nof the estate' and with a notice to quit, the agent may have almost\r\nanything he demands, short of possession of the farm and the home of\r\nthe tenant. The notice to quit is like a death warrant to the family.\r\nIt makes every member of it tremble and agonise, from the grey-headed\r\ngrandfather and grandmother, to the bright little children, who read\r\nthe advent of some impending calamity in the gloomy countenances and\r\nbitter words of their parents. The passion for the possession of land\r\nis the chord on which the agent plays, and at his touch it vibrates\r\nwith 'the deepest notes of woe.' By the agent of an improving landlord\r\nit is generally touched so cunningly, that its most exquisite torture\r\ncannot easily be proved to be a grievance. He presents an alternative\r\nto the tenant; he does less than the law allows. He could strike a\r\nmortal blow, but he lends a helping hand. Resistance entails ruin;\r\ncompliance secures friendship. Give up the old _status_, and accept\r\na new one: cease to stand upon _right_, consent to hang upon _mercy_,\r\nand all may be well.\r\n\r\nPassing a cottage by the road-side, one of the kindest and best of\r\nthose agents said to me, 'See with what infatuation these people cling\r\nto their old places! There is a man in that dilapidated cabin, with\r\nonly one acre of ground. It is an eyesore. I have offered him a nice\r\nnew slated cottage with ten acres, within a short distance, and he\r\nobstinately refuses to quit.'\r\n\r\nWhy did he refuse? I suppose, because the place was _his own_. The\r\nhouse was probably built by his father; it is the house in which he\r\nwas born, endeared to him, no doubt, by many powerful associations,\r\nlittle appreciated by those who never condescend to read the 'simple\r\nannals of the poor.' He felt, that if, like his neighbours, he moved\r\ninto a house built by the landlord, he would cease to be a free man,\r\nand would pass under the yoke of a _master._ I was with some visitors\r\nin one of the new cottages. The wife of the cottier with smiles\r\nassented to all that was said as to the neatness and comfort of the\r\nplace. I thought the smiles were forced. I was last in going out, and\r\nI heard her heave a heavy sigh. Perhaps she longed for the old home\r\nand its freedom, envying the lot of the sturdy peasant to whom I have\r\nalluded. Poor fellow! he must give way at last. But his proud manhood\r\nis the stuff of which Hampdens are made.\r\n\r\nI have devoted much time and attention to personal enquiries from town\r\nto town, from village to village, and from house to house, seeking\r\ncorroborative evidence from men of all ranks and professions, on the\r\neffect of the _Improved Land System_ on the working classes, and I\r\nwill here faithfully record as briefly as possible the result of my\r\nenquiries. I must premise a few words as to the principles of the\r\nsystem which is called 'English.'\r\n\r\n1. There is the principle of _contract_, by which alone any tenant\r\nis to be permitted to occupy land. There is to be no foothold in the\r\nisland, from the centre all round to the sea, from the top of the\r\nhighest mountain to the shore at low-water-mark, for any Irishman in\r\nhis native land, unless he obtains it by contract from a landlord and\r\npays for it.\r\n\r\n2. There is the principle of _compensation_ for unexhausted\r\nimprovements at the rate of five or six per cent. on the outlay,\r\nprovided the improvements have been made with the knowledge and\r\nconsent of the landlord. A certain number of years is held to be\r\nsufficient to recoup the tenant for his outlay. If he is removed\r\nbefore that time he is entitled to the balance of his invested\r\ncapital; just as if the relation were strictly commercial, and as if\r\nhe had no further claim than his percentage. If the landlord makes the\r\nimprovement--which he prefers doing, on the new system--he requires\r\nthe tenant to pay at the rate of four to six per cent. in the form of\r\nrent--a clear gain to the landlord, who can borrow money on much lower\r\nterms, and can hardly invest his capital so profitably or so safely\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n3. _Absenteeism_ is no disadvantage or loss to the country. This\r\nprinciple is in great favour with the agents. There is no theme on\r\nwhich they are so eloquent or so argumentative. In the absence of the\r\nlandlord the agent is all-powerful. What the Irish lord deputy was to\r\nthe Tudors and Stuarts, the Irish agent now is to the great absentee\r\nproprietor residing in London or Paris. He will undertake to\r\ndemonstrate that the West-end of London would be just as prosperous if\r\nthe Queen and her court resided constantly at Balmoral or Killarney;\r\nif the parliament met alternately in Edinburgh and Dublin, and if\r\nthe government offices were all at Liverpool. With the blessing of\r\nabsenteeism, houses in London would be built as fast, and would bring\r\nas high rents; trade would be as brisk, artizans of all sorts as well\r\npaid, life as happy, and the Londoners as well content. The Irish,\r\nhowever, have, in their ignorance of political economy, conceived the\r\nidea, that if the millions sterling sent annually out of the country\r\nto London were spent among those by whose labour the money is made,\r\nthere would be more employment for all sorts of tradesmen, more\r\nbusiness for the shopkeepers, more opportunities of advancement for\r\nthe farmers' sons, more houses built, more trees planted, more land\r\nreclaimed, more factories established, more money stirring, more\r\nwealth, more life, more enjoyment, an immense increase of national\r\nprosperity. The agents say that this is all a delusion.\r\n\r\n4. The next principle of the new agents is this--and to carry it out\r\nis the aim of all their improvements--that their mission is to produce\r\nthe greatest amount of rent from the smallest number of tenants.\r\n\r\n5. To reduce the population by _emigration_ or other means until there\r\nis barely a sufficient number of labourers to attend the agricultural\r\nmachines, and herd the cattle.\r\n\r\n6. To discourage _marriage_ in every possible way, and to diminish\r\npauperism till there shall be no further use of the workhouses but to\r\nserve as lying-in hospitals for the thrifty spinsters, as they do\r\nin Cumberland and Westmoreland--where the arrangement seems the\r\nmost natural thing in the world. It is certainly not an unnatural\r\nconsequence of the practice of men and women sleeping in the same\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nNow let us see the working of this new system in Ireland; for it is at\r\nwork more or less extensively in all the four provinces. The rules\r\nof the estate, when rigidly enforced, as they generally are by the\r\nimproving agents, tend steadily, powerfully, to break down the small\r\nfarmers. They are disappearing by thousands every year. Some take\r\ntheir chance across the Atlantic. Others fall into the condition of\r\nlabourers, and may earn 2 s. a day on the estate. This will last for\r\nawhile until the land is drained, manured, and turned into permanent\r\npasture. Then their occupation is gone. There is nothing more for them\r\nto do. There is no place for them, no room, no support in their native\r\nland. The grass will grow without their labour, and the bullocks will\r\nfatten without their care.\r\n\r\nWe are constantly hearing of the immense rise in wages since the\r\nfamine. Well, they are nominally higher, but in the old times the\r\nlabourer could get more for 8 d. or 10 d. than he can now get for 1\r\ns. 6 d. or 2 s. Fuel is now three times as dear as it was, because the\r\n'rules of the estate' will not allow the tenants to sell turf even\r\non the verge of extensive bogs. Milk, which was formerly abundant and\r\nvery cheap, is scarcely to be had at all now in the country towns\r\nand villages, because the land is devoted to feeding sheep and 'dry\r\ncattle.' Under the old system, the cottiers in the small towns and\r\nvillages, as well as on the roads in the country, were enabled to keep\r\npigs. The pig paid the rent, and made manure which was put out on the\r\nground of some neighbouring farmer, hired as 'conacre.' The crop of\r\npotatoes thus obtained was a great help in the winter months, when\r\nemployment was rarely to be had. This practice still prevails in\r\nUlster. The farmer puts in the crop for the manure, the cottier paying\r\nthe farmer's rent--5 s. to 10 s. a rood, or whatever it may be. With\r\nthis help the family get over the winter, and feed the pig, without\r\nwhich help, they say, it would be impossible to exist, even with\r\nconstant employment at a shilling a day. But on the estates of\r\nimproving landlords in the other provinces, the rules forbid the\r\ntenant to give the use of any ground for conacre. He must not, on pain\r\nof eviction, take manure for such a purpose, though it would help to\r\nenrich his land for the ensuing year. The evicted cottiers and small\r\nfarmers are forced to go to towns and villages, shut up in unwholesome\r\nrooms. When they have been thus so far got rid of, the most ingenious\r\ndevices are resorted to in order to render it impossible for them to\r\nlive. By the 'rules of the estate,' the supply of necessaries is\r\ncut off on every side. Without fuel, without milk, without potatoes,\r\nunless bought at a high rate for ready money, how are they to live?\r\nThe strong members of the poor man's family emigrate or go to\r\nservice; the weak ones and the young children pine away in a state\r\nof semi-starvation, preferring that to the best fare in the hated\r\nworkhouse.\r\n\r\nThe people are fully sensible of the causes of these privations. They\r\nknow that they have been forced into this condition by the landlords\r\nand their improving agents, induced in some cases by the temptation of\r\na few pounds to surrender their little holdings. The lord lieutenant\r\nof the King's County has thus cleared an immense district, and has\r\nhimself become a grazier and a cattle-dealer on a monster scale,\r\nattending the markets in person, and driving hard bargains with the\r\nfarmers and jobbers. By such means the population of that county has\r\nbeen reduced one-third in the last twenty years. The moral aspect of\r\nthis new system is worthy of consideration. It is thus presented by\r\nArchdeacon Redmond of Arklow, one of the most moderate and respected\r\nparish-priests in Ireland. When lately presenting an address to Lord\r\nGranard from his Wexford tenantry, he said:--\r\n\r\n'I have always heard the house of Forbes eulogised for its advocacy of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, and the name of Grogan Morgan has become\r\na household word through this county as one of the best landlords in\r\nIreland. He never broke down a rooftree during or since the terrible\r\nfamine. Under his fostering care they have all tided over the\r\ncalamitous time, and are happy and prosperous in their homes. He did\r\nnot think his estate overcrowded, nor did he avail himself of the\r\nmysterious destruction of the fruits of the earth, to clear off\r\nbeings made in God's image, and to drive them to the poorhouse, the\r\nfever-shed, or the emigrant ship, to whiten the bottom of the sea\r\nwith their bones, or to face the moral and physical perils of\r\nthe transatlantic cities. He did not read his bible, like Satan,\r\nbackwards, nor did he turn out the Son of God in the person of His\r\npoor. Hence his name is in benediction, and his estates are more\r\nprosperous than the estates of those who forget God in their worldly\r\nwisdom, and would seem to have no belief in a judgment to come. What\r\na happiness it is, my Lord and Lady Granard, for you to have such a\r\nheritage, and to know that you live in the hearts of your tenantry,\r\nwho would spill the last drop of their blood to shield you and your\r\ndear children from hurt and harm!'\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that such sentiments are peculiar to the\r\nCatholic clergy, or that their causes exist only in the south and\r\nwest. The Rev. Dr. Drew, a rector in the county Down, an Orange\r\nchaplain, a veteran champion of Protestantism and Toryism, but an\r\nhonourable and humane man, wrote the following letter last autumn:--\r\n\r\nIf the magnificent lecture of Mr. Butt had done nothing more than\r\nelicit this letter from Dr. Drew, it would have been much. But will\r\nnot the thoughts of many hearts be revealed in the same manner? What\r\na number of plain-speaking Drews we shall have denouncing tyranny when\r\ntheir consciences are relieved from the incubus of the Establishment!\r\n\r\n  _To Isaac Butt, Esq., LL.D._\r\n\r\n'My dear Butt--If every other man in the world entertained doubts of\r\nmy sincerity, you, at least, would give me credit for honesty and\r\njust intentions. I write to you accordingly, because my mind has been\r\nstirred to its inmost depths by the perusal of your address in my\r\nnative city of Limerick. I do not regard the subject of your address\r\nas a political one. It ought to be regarded solely as a question of\r\nhumanity, justice, common sense, and common honesty. I wish my lot had\r\nnever been cast in rural places. As a clergyman I hear what neither\r\nlandlords nor agents ever hear. I see the depression of the people;\r\ntheir sighs and groans are before me. They are brought so low as\r\noften to praise and glorify those who, in their secret hearts, are the\r\nobjects of abhorrence. All this came out gradually before me. Nor did\r\nI feel as I ought to feel in their behalf until, in my own person and\r\npurse, I became the victim of a system of tyranny which cries from\r\nearth to heaven for relief. Were I to narrate my own story it\r\nwould startle many of the Protestants of Ireland. There are good\r\nlandlords--never a better than the late Lord Downshire, or the living\r\nand beloved Lord Roden. But there are too many of another state of\r\nfeeling and action. There are estates in the north where the screw is\r\nnever withdrawn from its circuitous and oppressive work. Tenant-right\r\nis an unfortunate and delusive affair, simply because it is almost\r\ninvariably used to the landlord's advantage. Here we have an election\r\nin prospect, and in many counties no farmer will be permitted to think\r\nor act for himself. What right any one man has to demand the surrender\r\nof another's vote, I never could see. It is an act of sheer felony--a\r\nperfect \"stand-and-deliver\" affair. To hear a man slavishly and\r\ntimorously say, \"I must give my votes as the landlord wishes,\" is an\r\nadmission that the legislature, which bestowed the right of voting on\r\nthe tenant, should not see him robbed of his right, or subsequently\r\nscourged or banished from house and land, because he disregarded a\r\nlandlord's nod, or the menace of a land agent. At no little hazard of\r\nlosing the friendship of some who are high and good and kind, I write\r\nas I now do.--Yours, my dear Butt, very sincerely,\r\n\r\n  'THOMAS DREW.\r\n\r\n  'Dundrum, Clough, County Down,\r\n  September 7, 1868.'\r\n\r\nSome resident landlords employ a considerable number of labourers, to\r\neach of whom they give an excellent cottage, an acre of land, and\r\nthe grass of a cow, with work all the year round at seven shillings\r\na week. The tenants are most comfortable and most grateful, while the\r\npraise of those landlords is in the mouths of the peasantry all round\r\nthe country. But these considerate landlords are in a minority. As a\r\nrule, on the estates where the improvement system is going on, where\r\nfarms are being consolidated, and grazing supersedes tillage, an iron\r\npressure weighs upon the labouring classes, crushing them out of\r\nthe country. It is a cold, hard, calculating, far-reaching system of\r\ninhumanity, which makes the peasant afraid to harbour his own flesh\r\nand blood. It compels the grandmother to shut the door in the face of\r\nthe poor homeless orphan, lest the improving agent should hear of the\r\nact of sheltering him from the pitiless storm, not more pitiless than\r\nthe agent himself. The system of terrorism established by the threats\r\nof eviction de-humanizes a people remarkable for their hospitality to\r\nthe poor. Mr. Thomas Crosbie, of Cork, a gentleman whom I believe to\r\nbe as truthful and honourable as any agent in Ireland, gives appalling\r\nillustrations of this in his account of 'The Lansdowne Estates,'\r\npublished in 1858. Mr. Trench has given the English public several\r\npretty little romances about these estates; but he omitted some\r\nrealities that ought to have impressed themselves upon his memory as\r\ndeeply as any of his adventures. Mr. Crosbie found that the 'rules\r\nof the estate,' which were rigidly enforced, forbid tenants to build\r\nhouses for their labourers, 'the consequence of which was that men and\r\nwomen servants, no matter how great the number, must live under one\r\nroof.' The rules forbid marriage without the agent's permission. A\r\nyoung couple got married, and were chased away to America; and 'the\r\ntwo fathers-in-law were not merely warned; they were punished for\r\nharbouring their son and daughter, by a fine of a gale of rent.' It\r\nwas a rule 'that no stranger be lodged or harboured in any house\r\nupon the estate, lest he should become sick or idle, or in some way\r\nchargeable upon the poor-rates.' 'Several were warned and punished for\r\ngiving lodging to a brother-in-law, a daughter,' &c. 'A poor widow got\r\nher daughter married without the necessary permission; she was served\r\nwith a notice to quit, which was withdrawn on the payment of three\r\ngales of rent.' Mr. Crosbie gives a number of cases of the kind. The\r\nfollowing are the most remarkable. A tenant, Timothy Sullivan, of\r\nDerrynabrack, occasionally gave lodging to his sister-in-law, whilst\r\nher husband was seeking for work. He was afraid to lodge both or\r\neither; 'but the poor woman was in low fever, and approaching her\r\nconfinement. Even under such circumstances his terror was so great\r\nthat he removed her to a temporary shed on Jeremiah Sullivan's land,\r\nwhere she gave birth to a child. She remained there for some time.\r\nWhen \"the office\" heard of it, Jeremiah Sullivan was sent for and\r\ncompelled to pay a gale of rent (as fine), and to throw down the shed.\r\nThus driven out, and with every tenant on the estate afraid to\r\nafford her a refuge, the miserable woman went about two miles up the\r\nmountain, and, sick as she was, and so situated, took shelter in a dry\r\n_cavern_, in which she lived for several days. But her presence even\r\nthere was a crime, and a mulct of another gale of rent was levied off\r\nJeremiah Sullivan. Thus, within three weeks he was compelled to\r\npay two gales of 3 l. 2 s. 6 d. each. It was declared also that\r\nthe mountain being the joint property of Jeremiah Sullivan, Timothy\r\nSullivan, and Thady Sullivan, Timothy Sullivan was a participator in\r\nthe crime, and should be fined a gale of rent. The third, it appears,\r\nescaped.' 'S.G.O.' narrated another horrifying case in the _Times_,\r\nat the period of its occurrence, in 1851. Abridged, it runs thus:--'An\r\norder had gone forth on the estate (a common order in Ireland) that\r\nno tenant was to admit any lodger into his house. This was a general\r\norder. It appears, however, that sometimes special orders were given;\r\nand one was promulgated that Denis Shea should not be harboured. This\r\nboy had no father living. He had lived with a grandmother, who had\r\nbeen turned out of her holding for harbouring him. He had stolen\r\na shilling, a hen--done such things as a neglected twelve-year-old\r\nfamishing child will do. One night he came to his aunt Donoghue, who\r\nlodged with Casey. The latter told the aunt and uncle not to allow him\r\ninto the house, as the agent's drivers had given orders about him.\r\nThe aunt beat him away with a pitchfork, the uncle tied his hands\r\nwith cord behind his back. The poor child crawls to the door of a\r\nneighbour, and tries to get in. The uncle is called to take him away,\r\nand he does so. He yet returns with hands still tied behind, having\r\nbeen severely beaten. The child seeks refuge in other cabins; but all\r\nwere forbidden to shelter him. He is brought back by some neighbours\r\nin the night, who try to force the sinking child in upon his relation.\r\nThere is a struggle at the door. The child was heard asking some one\r\nto put him upright. In the morning there is blood upon the threshold.\r\nThe child is stiff dead--a corpse, with its arms tied; around it every\r\nmark of a last fearful struggle for shelter--food--the common rights\r\nof humanity.' Chief Baron Pigot tried the case, and gave a statement\r\nof the facts in his charge which Mr. Trench ought to have quoted, as a\r\nfaithful recorder of 'realities.'\r\n\r\n'On the western estate, that of Cahirciveen, there was some difference\r\nin the rules. If a son or daughter married, the father was obliged\r\nto retire with an allowance of 'a cow's grass' or grazing for his\r\nsupport. 'Only the newly married person will be left on the land, or\r\nany portion of it, even though the farm should contain 100 acres,\r\nor even though there should be two farms. This arbitrary regulation\r\noperates injuriously in point of morality, and keeps the land\r\nuncultivated. The people have to go to Nedeen, a distance of forty or\r\nfifty miles, to get leave to marry.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the 'North British Review,' No. CI. p.193.]\r\n\r\nThe Kenmare tenantry have recovered from the fearful shock of the\r\nfamine, after thousands of deaths from hunger, and thousands shipped\r\noff to America at 4 l. 10 s. a head. Mr. Trench's son, Mr. Townshend\r\nTrench, the pictorial illustrator of his father's book, is the acting\r\nagent, and an eloquent propagandist of his father's principles. The\r\nyoung marquis paid a visit to his tenantry in 1868, and he was almost\r\nworshipped. It is gratifying to know that in a speech on that occasion\r\nhe promised to see and judge for himself.\r\n\r\n'I feel,' he said, 'that my visit to Kenmare has taught me a valuable\r\nlesson. As you all know, I was called to my present position at a very\r\nyoung age, and I felt when I came in for my property that I had\r\nmuch to learn; and that is the reason why I was so anxious to travel\r\nthrough the country, and study the desires and comfort of the people.\r\nThat will afford me occupation for many a year to come, and it will\r\nafford me an occupation not only interesting but pleasing.\r\nNothing will do me a more hearty pleasure than to see the marks of\r\ncivilisation and progress in Kenmare--and not alone in Kenmare, but in\r\nthe whole country; and I shall hail every manifestation of improvement\r\nwith delight.'\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne's system is beautiful, but it is unfinished. Let him\r\n'crown the edifice with _liberty_.' He possesses a giant's power, and\r\nhe uses it like an angel. When he comes to trouble the waters, the\r\nmultitude gathers around the fountain to be healed. But his visits\r\nare, like angels' visits, few and far between. Many of the sick and\r\nimpotent folk, after long waiting, are not able to get near till the\r\nmiracle-worker has departed. An absentee landlord, be he ever so good,\r\nmust delegate his power to an agent. Agents have good memories,\r\nand their servants, the bailiffs, are good lookers-on. There is\r\na hierarchy in the heaven of landlordism--the under-bailiff, the\r\nhead-bailiff, the chief-clerk in the office, the sub-agent, the\r\nhead-agent. All these must be submissively approached and anxiously\r\npropitiated before the petitioner's prayers can reach the ears of Jove\r\nhimself, seated aloft on his remote Olympian throne. He may be,\r\nand for the most part really is--if he belongs to the old stock of\r\naristocratic divinities--generous and gracious, incapable of meanness,\r\nbaseness, or cruelty. But the tenant has to do, not with the absentee\r\ndivinity, but with his priest--not with the good spirit, but his\r\nmedium; and this go-between is not always noble, or disinterested,\r\nor unexacting. To him power may be new--a small portion of it may\r\nintoxicate him, like alcohol on an empty stomach. He was not born to\r\nan inheritance of sycophancy; it comes like an _afflatus_ upon him,\r\nand it turns his head. It creates an appetite, like strong drink,\r\nwhich grows into a disease. This appetite is as capricious as it is\r\ninsatiable. Hence, the chief characteristic of landlord power, as\r\nfelt by the tenant, is _arbitrariness_. The agent may make any rule\r\nhe pleases, and as many exceptions to every rule as he pleases. He\r\nmay allow rents to run in arrear; he may suddenly come down upon the\r\ndefaulter with 'a fell swoop;' he may require the rents to be paid\r\nup to the day; he may, without reason assigned, call in 'the hanging\r\ngale;' he may abate or increase the rents at will; he may inflict\r\nfines for delay or give notices to quit for the sole purpose of\r\nbringing in fees to his friend or relative, the solicitor. But\r\nwhatever he may choose to do, the tenant has nothing for it but to\r\nsubmit; and he must submit with a good grace. Woe to him if the agony\r\nof his spirit is revealed in the working of his features, or in an\r\naudible groan! Most of the poor fellows do submit, till their hearts\r\nare broken--till the hot iron has entered their souls and seared their\r\nconsciences. When the _slave_ is thus finished, the agent and his\r\njourneymen are satisfied with their handiwork; their 'honours' can\r\nthen count on any sort of services they may choose to exact--may bid\r\ndefiance to the priest and the agitator, and boast of an orderly and\r\ndeserving tenantry devoted to the best of landlords, who is their\r\nnatural protector. It would be wicked to interfere with these amicable\r\npersons. Why talk about leases? The tenants will not have them; they\r\ndon't want security or independence by contract. So most of the agents\r\nreport--but not all. There are noble exceptions which relieve the\r\ngloomy picture.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly one disadvantage connected with a settlement of the\r\nland question which would abolish the arbitrary power of proprietors\r\nand their agents--it would put an end to the romance of Irish\r\nlandlordism. The Edgeworths, the Morgans, the Banims, the Carletons,\r\nand the Levers would then be deprived of the best materials for their\r\nfictions. The fine old family, over-reached and ruined by a dishonest\r\nagent; the cruelly evicted farmer, with his wife and children\r\nfever-stricken, and his bedridden mother cast out on the roadside on\r\nChristmas Eve, exposed to the pelting of the hailstorm, while their\r\nhome was unroofed and its walls levelled by the crowbar brigade; the\r\nonce comfortable but now homeless father making his way to London, and\r\ntrying day after day to present a petition in person to his landlord,\r\nrepulsed from the gate of the great house, and laughed at for his\r\nfrieze and brogue by pampered flunkeys. Then he travels on foot to his\r\nlordship's country-seat, scores or hundreds of miles--is taken up, and\r\nbrought before the magistrates as 'an Irish rogue and vagabond.' At\r\nlength he meets his lordship accidentally, and reveals to him the\r\nsystem of iniquity that prevails on his Irish estate at Castle\r\nSquander: Next we have the sudden and unexpected appearance of the god\r\nof the soil at his agent's office, sternly demanding an account of his\r\nstewardship. He gives ready audience to his tenants, and fires with\r\nindignation at bitter complaints from the parents of ruined daughters.\r\nInvestigation is followed by the ignominious eviction of the\r\ntyrannical and roguish agent and his accomplices, a disgorging of\r\ntheir ill-gotten wealth, compensation to plundered and outraged\r\ntenants, the liberal distribution of poetical justice right and left.\r\n\r\nMany other agents have followed Mr. Trench's example in forbidding\r\nto marry, and commanding to abstain from hospitality and charity. An\r\nejectment was lately obtained at the quarter sessions in a southern\r\ncounty against a widow who had married without leave, or married a\r\ndifferent person from the one the agent selected. But it is supposed\r\nthat the threat of assassination prevented a recourse to extremities\r\nin this and other cases. For the people seem with one consent to have\r\nmade a desperate stand against this cruel tyranny. A landlord said\r\nto me, 'No one in this part of the country would _presume_ to evict\r\na tenant now from fear of assassination. _That_ is the tenant's\r\nsecurity.'\r\n\r\nThe wretched outcasts, whom 'improvement' has swept off the estates,\r\nare crowded into cities and towns, without employment, without food.\r\nFeeling bitterly their degradation and misery, and taught to blame the\r\nGovernment, they become demoralized and desperately disaffected. From\r\nthese fermenting masses issues the avenging scourge of Fenianism--'the\r\npestilence that walketh in darkness, and slayeth at noonday.'\r\n\r\nFor my part, I cannot understand the meaning of improving a country by\r\ndisinheriting and banishing its inhabitants. I do not understand men\r\nwho say the population is too dense, and yet give to one family a\r\ntract of land large enough to support ten families, turning out the\r\nnine to make room for the one. A great deal has been said about the\r\nevils of small farms. But the most disturbed and impoverished parts of\r\nIreland are those in which the farms are largest; while the two most\r\nprosperous and best ordered counties--Armagh and Wexford--are the\r\ncounties in which small farms most abound. I call a reluctant witness,\r\nMaster Fitzgibbon, to testify that when the Irish tenant, be his\r\nholding ever so small, gets common justice and is not subjected to\r\ncaprice, he gives no trouble. That gentleman informs us that there are\r\n650 estates of all magnitudes, from 100 l. to 20,000 l. a-year, under\r\nthe control and management of the court of chancery; the total rents\r\nof these amount to 494,056 l. a-year payable by 28,581 tenants. These\r\nestates are in all parts of Ireland, not only in all the provinces,\r\nbut in all the counties, without exception; and, according to Master\r\nFitzgibbon, they fairly represent the tenantry of the whole country.\r\nHe has 452 of the estates under his own jurisdiction, and the rents\r\nof these amount to 330,809 l., paid by 18,287 tenants. He has now\r\nbeen ten years in the office, during which 'the rents have been paid\r\nwithout murmuring or complaints worth noticing.' 'The pressure of\r\nlegal remedies for these rents has been very little used; the\r\nnumber of evictions absolutely trifling; and of between 400 and 500\r\nreceivers, who collect these rents, _not one has ever been assailed_,\r\nor interfered with, or threatened in the discharge of his duty, as\r\nfar as I have been able to discover; and I am the person to whom the\r\nreceiver should apply for redress if anything of the kind occurred.\r\nIt is very well known that my ears are open to any just complaint\r\nfrom any tenant, and yet I am very seldom appealed to, considering the\r\ngreat number of tenants; and whenever a complaint is well-founded,\r\nit is promptly and effectually redressed, at scarcely any expense of\r\ncosts. I believe the other three Masters would make substantially\r\na similar report to this in respect of the estates under their\r\njurisdiction.'\r\n\r\nMaster Fitzgibbon proceeds to state that 'on one estate there are\r\n2,500 tenants, paying 13,000 l.,--being an average of 6 l. a-year.\r\nThis estate has been sold, and three of the lots fetched over 30\r\nyears' purchase of the yearly profit rents. The fourth lot is held by\r\nsmall cottiers, at rents which average only 2 l., and this lot fetched\r\n23 years' purchase. This estate has been under a receiver for three\r\nyears, and there has never been one complaint from a tenant. What is\r\nstated of this estate may be said of every one of them in all the four\r\nprovinces.' He adds: 'Clamour, agitation, or violence of any kind I\r\nhave never had to deal with amongst the tenantry of any one of these\r\nestates since I came into office.'\r\n\r\nAnother witness of larger views, and free from unhappy prejudices\r\nagainst the majority of his countrymen--Mr. Marcus Keane, agent to the\r\nMarquis of Conyngham--in a letter to Colonel Vandeleur, M.P., lately\r\ngave the result of his experience for thirty years as agent of several\r\nlarge estates, and as a landlord, on the Irish land question. I\r\nsubmit his suggestions to my readers, as eminently worthy of the\r\nconsideration of statesmen at the present time:--\r\n\r\n'The outline of measures submitted for your consideration combines\r\nthe very unusual recommendation of meeting, on the one hand, with\r\nthe approbation of some good landlords of the higher class (who, like\r\nyourself, have long been practically acknowledging the just claims of\r\ntenants), and, at the same time, of satisfying the claims of many of\r\nthe warmest advocates of the tenant class. It is calculated to protect\r\nthe farmers from selfish landlords, whose conduct has tended much to\r\nproduce the serious disaffection that now prevails.\r\n\r\n'I need not burthen you with a lengthened recital of the facts which\r\nrender such legislation absolutely necessary to the tranquillity of\r\nsociety. In outline, however, they may be briefly stated--\r\n\r\n'_First_--The great mass of Irish tenantry have no better title to\r\ntheir holdings than the will of their landlords.\r\n\r\n'_Second_--Education is daily rendering the tenant class more\r\nimpatient of the condition of dependence which their want of title\r\nnecessitates.\r\n\r\n'_Third_--Every good tenant must improve his land more or less, in\r\norder to live in comparative comfort.\r\n\r\n'_Fourth_--The rentals of Ireland are steadily following the\r\nimprovements of the tenants. Some landlords suffer a considerable\r\nmargin to exist between the actual value and the rent paid; while\r\nothers lose no opportunity of forcing the rents to the highest amount\r\nthat circumstances permit.\r\n\r\n'_Fifth_--Although good tenants must improve in order to live\r\ncomfortably, their improvements are not one-fourth of what the\r\ncondition of the country invites, and are far below what they would be\r\nif the occupiers were afforded equitable security.\r\n\r\n'_Sixth_--Trade, manufactures, and industrial occupations require\r\nlocal accumulations of surplus capital in order to their prosperity;\r\nand such accumulations are hindered by the general want of security\r\nof tenure. Society at large is therefore deeply interested in the\r\nprotection of the tenant class.\r\n\r\n'_Seventh_--The increased expense of the governmental establishments,\r\ncivil and military, which Irish disaffection entails, renders it a\r\nmatter of imperial importance that the Irish land question should be\r\nsatisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\n'Irish rentals have, in some counties, increased more than tenfold\r\nsince the beginning of the eighteenth century.'\r\n\r\nThe next witness shall be a landlord, one of the best and noblest of\r\nhis class. At a tenant-right meeting of the county Longford, the Earl\r\nof Granard said:--'The proposition commences by asserting that which\r\nhas been acknowledged by successive administrations--that the present\r\nstate of the land laws of Ireland is highly unsatisfactory. The\r\nnecessity for their reform has been urged upon parliament since the\r\ndays of O'Connell up to the present time. The want of reform upon the\r\nmost vital question which affects the prosperity of Ireland has\r\nbeen the fruitful source of agrarian disturbance, of poverty and\r\nof misfortune in every county in Ireland. To take an example near\r\nhome,--what rendered Ballinamuck a by-word for deeds of violence? Why,\r\nthat system which permitted a landlord to treat the people of that\r\ndistrict with high-handed injustice. And why is that district\r\nnow amongst the most peaceable in the county? Because it is now\r\nadministered by its proprietor in a spirit of justice and fair play,\r\nand because that proprietor recognises the fact that property has its\r\nduties as well as its rights. I believe that similar results are to\r\nbe obtained everywhere that the warm-hearted and kindly people of this\r\ncountry are treated with justice. In his evidence before Mr. Maguire's\r\ncommittee, Mr. Curling, the excellent agent of an equally excellent\r\nlandlord--Lord Devon--speaking of his property in Limerick, said that\r\nthe most warm-hearted and grateful people he had ever met with were\r\nthe Irish. He was asked, \"Grateful for what?\" and he replied, \"Even\r\nfor fair play.\" That is to say, they were grateful for that which in\r\nevery country save this would have been theirs by law. And it is to\r\na people thus described by, mind you, not an Irishman, but an English\r\ngentleman--to a people, I believe, the most religious and affectionate\r\nin Europe, that the simple act of justice, of repealing unjust\r\nstatutes, has been refused. I say it advisedly, that to the system\r\nof land laws, which we hope to alter--which at least we are here to\r\nprotest against--are to be attributed those fearful agrarian outrages\r\nwhich disgrace the fair fame of our country. A celebrated minister of\r\npolice in France, whenever he heard of a conspiracy, used to ask who\r\nwas the woman, believing that there was always one mixed up with such\r\norganisations, and in a similar spirit, whenever I hear of an outrage\r\nin Ireland, I am always inclined to enquire, \"Who is the landlord?\"\r\nFor I do not hear of such things occurring on estates where justice\r\nand fair play are the rule and not the exception. But brighter days\r\nare now in store for us. We have at the head of affairs the most\r\nearnest, the most conscientious minister that has ever sat on the\r\ntreasury bench. He has promised to redress your grievances, and having\r\nas his able lieutenants Mr. Bright, who has ever a kindly word for\r\nIreland, and Lord Kimberley, whose first act after giving up the\r\nlord-lieutenancy was to say to the House of Lords that until the\r\nchurch and land questions were settled there would be neither peace\r\nnor contentment in the land--he must be successful. As to what we\r\nwant there can be no doubt. The five points of the Irish charter\r\nare--fixity of tenure at reasonable rents; recognition of right of\r\noccupancy as distinct from right of ownership; standard valuation\r\nfor letting purposes; retrospective compensation for 20 years; and\r\narbitration courts in cases of dispute between owner and occupier.'\r\n\r\nI cannot better express the conclusion of the whole matter than in\r\nthe words of a writer in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, who thoroughly\r\nunderstands the question. Nothing can be more truthful and accurate\r\nthan the way in which he puts the tenants' case:--\r\n\r\n'\"Morally,\" they say, \"we are part-owners. We have a moral right to\r\nlive here. If a great landlord considered that he could make more\r\nof his estate by clearing it of its inhabitants, and accordingly\r\nproceeded to do so, he would do a cruel act. What we wish is to see\r\nour moral rights converted into legal rights. If you ask us precisely\r\nwhat it is that we wish, we reply that we wish to be able to live in\r\nmoderate comfort in our native land, and to be able to make our plans\r\nupon the assumption that we shall not be interfered with. It is\r\nnot for us ignorant peasants to draw an Act of Parliament upon this\r\nsubject, or to say how our views are to be reconciled with your\r\nEnglish law, which, on other accounts, we by no means love. You, the\r\nEnglish Government, must find out for yourselves how to do that. What\r\nwe want is to be secure and live in reasonable comfort, and we shall\r\nnever be at rest, and we will never leave you at peace, till this is\r\narranged in some way or other.\" We do not say whether this feeling is\r\nright or wrong, we do not say how it is to be dealt with, but we do\r\nsay that it is as intelligible, not to say as natural, a feeling as\r\never entered into human hearts, and we say, moreover, that it would\r\nbe very difficult to exaggerate either its generality, its force, its\r\nextent, or the degree to which it has been excited by recent events.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that to persist in regarding the relation\r\nbetween landlord and tenant as one of contract merely, to repeat again\r\nand again in every possible form that all that the Irish peasants\r\nhave a right to say is that they have made a hard bargain with their\r\nlandlords which they wish the legislature to modify, is to shut\r\nour eyes to the feelings of the people, feelings which it will be\r\ndifficult and also dangerous to disregard. The very gist and point\r\nof the whole claim of the tenants is that their moral right (as they\r\nregard it) is as sacred, and ought to be as much protected by law, as\r\nthe landlords' legal right, and that it is a distinct grievance to a\r\nman to be prevented from living in Ireland on that particular piece\r\nof land on which he was born and bred, and which was occupied by his\r\nancestors before him.'\r\n\r\nThe whole drift of this history bears on this point. The policy of the\r\npast must be reversed. The tenants must be rooted in the soil instead\r\nof being rooted out. 'Improvement' must include the people as well\r\nas the land, and agents must no longer be permitted to arrogate to\r\nthemselves the functions of Divine Providence.\r\n\r\n    '_Naturam expellas furcâ, tamen usque recurret._'\r\n\r\nOne of the best pamphlets on the Irish Land Question is by Mr. William\r\nM'Combie, of Aberdeen. A practical farmer himself, his sagacity\r\nhas penetrated the vitals of the subject. His observations, while\r\ntravelling through the country last year, afford a remarkable\r\ncorroboration of the conclusions at which I have arrived. Of the new\r\nmethod of 'regenerating Ireland,' he says:--\r\n\r\n'In it the resources of the soil--to get the most possible out of it\r\nby the most summary process--is the great object; the people are of\r\nlittle or no account, save as they can be made use of to accomplish\r\nthis object. But, indeed, it is not alone by the promoters of the\r\ngrand culture that the people have been disregarded, but by Irish\r\nlandlords, generally, of both classes. By the improving landlords--who\r\nare generally recent purchasers--they are regarded merely as\r\nlabourers; by the leave-alone landlords as rent-producers. The one\r\nclass have ejected the occupiers, the other have applied, harder and\r\nharder, the screw, until the \"good landlord\"--the landlord almost\r\nworshipped in Ireland at this hour--is the landlord who neither evicts\r\nhis tenants nor raises their rents. The consequences are inevitable,\r\nand, over a large portion of the island, they are patent to every\r\neye--they obtrude themselves everywhere. The people are poor; they are\r\ndespondent, broken-spirited. In the south of Ireland decay is written\r\non every town. In the poorer parts you may see every fifth or sixth\r\nhouse tenantless, roofless, allowed from year to year to moulder\r\nand moulder away, unremoved, unrepaired.... To make room for these\r\nlarge-scale operations, evictions must go on, and as the process\r\nproceeds the numbers must be augmented of those who are unfit to\r\nwork for hire and unable to leave the country. The poor must be\r\nmade poorer; many now self-supporting made dependent. Pauperism must\r\nspread, and the burden of poor rates be vastly increased. If the\r\ngreatest good of the greatest number be the fundamental principle of\r\ngood government, this is not the direction in which the state should\r\nseek to accomplish the regeneration of Ireland. The development of the\r\nresources of the land ought to be made compatible with the improvement\r\nof the condition of the people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION--AN APPEAL TO ENGLISHMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of understanding the case of Ireland is proverbial.\r\nIts most enlightened friends in England and Scotland are often charged\r\nwith 'gross ignorance of the country.' They might excuse themselves by\r\nanswering, that when they seek instruction from Irishmen, one native\r\ninstructor is sure to contradict the other. Yet there must be some\r\npoint of view from which all sides of the Irish question can be seen,\r\nsome light in which the colours are not confused, the picture is not\r\nexaggerated, the features are not distorted. Every nation has its\r\nidiosyncrasy, proceeding from race, religion, laws, institutions,\r\nclimate, and other circumstances; and this idiosyncrasy may be the\r\nkey of its history. In Ireland three or four nationalities are bound\r\ntogether in one body politic; and it is the conflict of their several\r\nidiosyncrasies which perplexes statesmen, and constitutes the main\r\ndifficulty of the Irish problem. The blood of different races is\r\nmingled, and no doubt greatly modified by ages of intercourse.\r\nBut _religion_ is an abiding force. The establishment of religious\r\nequality in Ireland is a glorious achievement, enough in itself to\r\nimmortalise any statesman. It is a far greater revolution than was\r\neffected by the Emancipation Act, and more to the credit of the chief\r\nactor; because, while Mr. Gladstone did spontaneously what he\r\nfirmly believed to be right in principle. Sir Robert Peel did, from\r\nnecessity, what he as firmly believed was wrong in principle. But no\r\nreasonable man expected that the disestablishment of the Church would\r\nsettle all Irish questions; in fact, it but clears the way for the\r\nsettlement of some of the most important and urgent. It makes it\r\npossible for Irishmen of every creed to speak in one voice to\r\nthe Government. Their respective clergy, hitherto so intent on\r\necclesiastical claims and pretensions, will no longer pass by on the\r\nother side, but turn Samaritans to their bleeding country, fallen\r\namong the thieves of Bigotry and Faction. There are many high\r\nProtestants--indeed, I may say all, except the aristocracy--who, while\r\nfirmly believing in the vital importance of the union of the three\r\nkingdoms, earnestly wishing that union to be real and perpetual,\r\ncannot help expressing their conviction that Ireland has been greatly\r\nwronged by England--wronged by the legislature, by the Government,\r\nand most of all by the crown. In no country in the world has loyalty\r\nexisted under greater difficulties, in none has it been so ill\r\nrequited, in none has so much been done as if of set purpose to\r\nstarve it to death. In the reign of Elizabeth the capricious will of\r\na despotic sovereign was exerted to crush the national religion, while\r\nthe greatest military exploits of her ablest viceroys consisted of\r\npredatory excursions, in which they slaughtered or carried away the\r\nhorses and cattle, burned the crops and houses, and laid the country\r\nwaste and desolate, in order to create famines for the wholesale\r\ndestruction of the population, thus spoiled and killed as a punishment\r\nfor the treason of their chiefs, over whom they had no control.\r\n\r\nIn the reigns of James I. and Charles I. there was a disposition among\r\nthe remnant of the people--\r\n\r\n    To fly from petty tyrants to the throne.\r\n\r\nBut the Stuarts appealed to Irish loyalty merely for the support of\r\ntheir dynasty, and William III. laid the laurels won on the banks of\r\nthe Boyne upon the altar of English monopoly. In the reigns of Anne\r\nand the three Georges, law was made to do the work of the sword, and\r\nthe Catholics of Ireland, constituting the mass of the nation,\r\nknew their sovereign only as the head of an alien power, cruel and\r\nunrelenting in its oppression. They were required to love a German\r\nprince whom they had never seen. He called himself the father of\r\nhis subjects; and he had millions of subjects on the other side of a\r\nnarrow channel, whom he never knew, and never cared to know. When at\r\nlength the dominant nation relented, and wished to strike the penal\r\nchains from the hands of her sister, the king forbade the act of\r\nmercy, pleading his conscience and his oath as a bar to justice and to\r\nfreedom, but yielding at last to English state necessity, and robbing\r\nconcession of its grace, of all its power to conciliate. From the\r\nbattle of the Boyne to Catholic emancipation, the king of Ireland had\r\nnever set foot on Irish soil, except in the case of George IV., whose\r\nvisit was little better than a melodramatic exhibition, repaid by\r\ncopious libations of flattery, which however failed to melt his\r\nbigotry, or to persuade him to redeem his solemn promises and pledges,\r\nuntil, nine years later, he was compelled to yield by the fear of\r\nimpending civil war.\r\n\r\nIreland may get from her sister, England, everything but that for\r\nwhich the heart yearns--affection--that which alone 'can minister to\r\na mind diseased, can pluck from the memory its rooted sorrow, and rase\r\nout the written troubles from the brain.' That is just what Ireland\r\nneeds above all things. She wants to be kept from brooding morbidly\r\nover the dismal past, and to be induced to apply herself in a cheerful\r\nspirit to the business of life. The prescriptions of state physicians\r\ncannot fully reach the root of the disease. Say that it is a\r\nsentimental malady--a delusion. What is gained by saying _that_,\r\nif the sentiment or the delusion makes life wretched, unfits for\r\nbusiness, produces suicidal propensities, and renders _keepers_\r\nnecessary?\r\n\r\nIn theory, Ireland is one with England; in practice, she is hourly\r\nmade to feel the reverse. _The Times_, and all the journals which\r\nexpress the instincts of the dominant nation, constantly speak of the\r\nIrish people as '_the subjects of England_, whom Englishmen have\r\na right to control. They are the subjects of the Queen only in a\r\nsecondary sense--_as_ the Queen of England, and reigning over them\r\nthrough England. Every sovereign, from Queen Elizabeth to Queen\r\nVictoria, was sovereign of Ireland merely in this subordinate sense,\r\neven when there was an Irish parliament. The King of _Ireland_ could\r\nspeak to his Irish parliament only as he was advised by his English\r\nministers; and their advice was invariably prompted by English\r\ninterests. Her king was not _hers_ in the true sense. His _heart_ and\r\nhis company were wholly given to another, to whose pride, power,\r\nand splendour she was made to minister. That state of things\r\nstill continues in effect, and while it lasts Ireland can never be\r\ncontented. Her heart will always be disquieted within her. Something\r\nbitter will ever be bubbling up from the bottom of that troubled\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nNor let it be supposed that this is due to a peculiar idiosyncrasy\r\nin Ireland--to some unhappy congenital malformation, or some original\r\ntaint in the blood. It has been often asked whether England would have\r\nsubmitted to similar treatment from Ireland if their relations were\r\nreversed. Englishmen have not answered that question because they\r\ncannot understand it. They find it difficult to apply the Divine\r\nmaxim, 'Do as you would be done by.' in their dealings with other\r\nnations. But they can scarcely conceive its application to their\r\ndealings with Ireland, any more than the American planter could have\r\nconceived the duty of fraternizing with his negroes. If we draw from\r\nthis fact the logical inference, we shall be at a loss to discern\r\nwhether the Celt or the Saxon suffers more from the moral perversity\r\nof his nature. The truth is, both are perverted by their unnatural\r\nrelations, which are a standing outrage on the spirit of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Austria long laboured to govern one nation through\r\nanother and for another, in right of conquest, and we know the result\r\nin Italy and Hungary. Lombardy, though well cultivated and materially\r\nprosperous, could never be reconciled to Austrian rule. Even the\r\nnobility could not be tempted to appear at court. Venetia was more\r\npassionately and desperately hostile, and was consequently crushed by\r\nmilitary repression, till the country was turned into a wilderness,\r\nand the capital once so famous for its commerce and splendour, became\r\none of the most melancholy scenes of ruin and desolation to be found\r\nin the world. The Austrians, and those who sympathised with Austria\r\nas the great conservative power of the Continent, ascribed all this\r\nto the perversity of the Italian nature, and to the influence of\r\nagitators and conspirators. Austria was bountiful to her Italian\r\nsubjects, and would be more lenient if she could, but their vices of\r\ncharacter and innate propensity to rebellion, rendered necessary\r\na system of coercion. Hence the prisons were full of political\r\noffenders; the soldier and the executioner were constantly employed in\r\nmaintaining law and order. All the Emperor wanted was that his Italian\r\nprovinces should be so thoroughly amalgamated with Austria, as to form\r\none firmly united empire, and that the inhabitants should be content\r\nwith their position as _Austrian_ subjects, ruled by Austrian\r\nofficials. But this was precisely what they could not or would not\r\nbe. 'They smiled at the drawn dagger and defied its point.' They would\r\nsacrifice their lives, but they would not sacrifice their nationality\r\nat the bidding of an alien power.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the force of the national sentiment, and the\r\ntremendous magnitude of the calamities to which its persistent\r\nviolation leads. But the case of Hungary is still more apposite as an\r\nillustration of the English policy in Ireland. The Hungarians had\r\nan ancient constitution and parliament of their own. The Emperor of\r\nAustria was their legitimate king, wearing the crown of Hungary. In\r\nthis capacity the Hungarians were willing to yield to him the most\r\ndevoted loyalty. But he wanted to weld his empire into a compact\r\nunity, and to centralise all political power at Vienna, so that\r\nAustria should be the head and heart of the system, and the other\r\nprovinces her hands and her feet. Hungary resisted, and revolted. The\r\nresult was a desolating civil war, in which she was triumphant, till\r\nthe Czar came to the rescue of his brother despot, and poured his\r\nlegions in overwhelming numbers into the devoted country. Hungary was\r\nnow at the feet of her sovereign, and Austria, the dominant state,\r\ntried to be conciliatory, in order to bring about the desired\r\namalgamation and consolidation of the empire. She did so, with\r\nevery apparent prospect of success, and it was generally considered\r\nthroughout Europe that there was an end of the Hungarian kingdom.\r\nBut Hungarian nationality survived, and still resisted Austrian\r\ncentralisation. The Hungarians struggled for its recognition\r\nconstitutionally, manfully, with admirable self-control, moderation,\r\nand wisdom, until at length they achieved a peaceful victory. Their\r\nsovereign reigns over them as King of Hungary; he and the empress\r\ndwell among them, without Austrian guards. Their children are born\r\namong them, and they are proud to call them natives of Hungary. The\r\nHungarians, as subjects of _Austria_, were discontented, miserable,\r\nincurably disaffected. As subjects of their own king (though he is\r\nalso Emperor of Austria) they are intensely loyal. They are prosperous\r\nand happy, because they are free. And though they have their\r\ndistinctions of race and religion, they are united. The Magyars of\r\nHungary correspond very nearly to the Protestants of Ireland. Though\r\na minority, their energy, their education, their natural talent\r\nfor organisation and government, their love of freedom, their frank\r\nrecognition of the rights of conscience, enable them to lead without\r\ninspiring jealousy, just as the Protestants of Ireland were enabled to\r\nlead in 1782, notwithstanding the existence of Protestant Ascendancy.\r\nReligious equality is not a cause of tranquillity in itself. It\r\ntranquillises simply because it implies the absence of irritation.\r\nIt takes a festering thorn out of the side of the unestablished\r\ncommunity--a thorn which inflames the blood of every one of its\r\nmembers. Let worldly interest, political power, and social precedence\r\ncease to be connected with the profession of religion, and religious\r\ndifferences would cease to produce animosity and intolerance. If the\r\nMagyars had been the Hungarian party of Protestant ascendancy, and if\r\nthe Protestant interest had also been the Austrian interest; if the\r\nmission of the Magyars had been to act as a garrison, to keep down the\r\nRoman Catholic majority, their cause could never have triumphed till\r\nProtestant ascendancy should be abolished. But Hungarian Protestantism\r\ndid not need such support, although the Pope has as much authority in\r\nHungary as in Ireland. Of course the cases of Hungary and Ireland\r\nare in many respects dissimilar. But they are alike in this: their\r\nrespective histories establish the great fact that the most benevolent\r\nof sovereigns, and the wisest of legislatures, can never produce\r\ncontentment or loyalty in a kingdom which is ruled _through_ and _for_\r\nanother kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe can easily understand that when the light of royalty shines upon a\r\ncountry _through a conquering nation still dominant_, the medium is of\r\nnecessity dense, cold, refracting, and discolouring. Of this the\r\nbest illustration is derived from the relations between Austria and\r\nHungary, now so happily adjusted to the unspeakable advantage of\r\nboth nations. Austrian rule was unsympathetic, harsh, insolent,\r\ndomineering, based upon the arrogant assumption that the Hungarians\r\nwere incapable of managing their own affairs without the guidance\r\nof Austrian wisdom and the support of Austrian steadiness. But the\r\nHungarians, united among themselves, putting their trust, not in\r\nboastful, vapouring, and self-seeking agitators, but in honest,\r\ntruthful, high-minded, and capable statesmen, persevered in a course\r\nof firm, but temperate and constitutional, national self-assertion,\r\nuntil the Austrians were compelled to put away from them their\r\nsupercilious airs of natural superiority, and to concede the principle\r\nof international equality and the right of self-government.\r\n\r\nWhat sickens the reader of Irish history most of all is the anarchy\r\nof the old clan system, the everlasting alternation of outrages\r\nand avenging reprisals. One faction, when it felt strong and had a\r\nfavourable opportunity, made a sudden raid upon another faction, taken\r\nat a disadvantage, plundering and killing with reckless fury. The\r\noutraged party treasured up its anger till it had power to retaliate,\r\nand then glutted its vengeance without mercy in the same way. When\r\nthis fatal propensity to mutual destruction was restrained by law, it\r\nbroke out from time to time in other ways. What was wanted to cure it\r\neffectually was a strong, steady, central government, such as England\r\nenjoys herself. But the very system which is most calculated to foster\r\nfactiousness is the one which has reigned for centuries in Dublin\r\nCastle. The British sovereign knows no party, and, whatever other\r\nsovereigns have done, Queen Victoria has never forgotten this\r\nconstitutional principle. But the Irish lord-lieutenant is always a\r\nparty-man, and is always surrounded by party-men. They were Whigs or\r\nTories, Liberals or Conservatives, often extreme in their views and\r\nviolent in their temper. The vice of the old clan system was its\r\ntendency to unsettle, to undo, to upset, to smash and destroy. Instead\r\nof counteracting that vice (which still lingers in the national\r\nblood), by a fixed, unchanging system of administration, based on\r\nprinciples of unswerving rectitude, which knows no distinction\r\nof party, no favouritism, England ruled by the alternate sway of\r\nfactions.\r\n\r\n_The Times_, referring to the debate on the Irish Church, remarked\r\nthat the viceroyalty was more and more 'a mere ornament.' It is\r\nreally nothing more. The viceroy has no actual power, and if he has\r\nstatesmanship, it is felt to be out of place. He can scarcely give\r\npublic expression to his sentiments on any political questions without\r\noffending one party or the other, whereas the estate of the realm\r\nwhich he represents is neutral and ought to keep strictly to neutral\r\nground. As to the effect of the office in degrading the national\r\nspirit among the nobility and gentry, we could not have a better\r\nillustration than the fact that the amiable Lord Carlisle was\r\naccustomed, at the meeting of the Royal Dublin Society, to tell its\r\nmembers that the true aim, interest, glory, and destiny of Ireland was\r\nto be a pasture and a dairy for England,--a compliment which seemed to\r\nhave been gratefully accepted, or was at all events allowed to pass.\r\n\r\nBut even as an 'ornament' the viceregal system is a failure. The\r\nViceroy with his family ought to be the head of society in Ireland,\r\njust as the Queen is in England. The royal family are the same to all\r\nparties and classes, showing no partiality on the ground of politics,\r\nbut smiling with equal favour and recognition upon all. In Ireland,\r\nhowever, a liberal lord lieutenant is generally shunned by the\r\nConservative portion of the aristocracy, which forms the great\r\nmajority of the class. On the other hand the Conservatives flock in\r\nlarge numbers to the court of a Tory Viceroy, while Liberals stand\r\naloof. Instead therefore of being a centre of union to all sections\r\nof the best society, and bringing them together, so that they may know\r\none another, and enjoy the advantages due to their rank, the viceregal\r\ncourt operates as a source of jealousy and division. So that, looking\r\nat the institution as a mere ornament of society, as a centre of\r\nfashionable life and refining influences, facilitating intercourse\r\nbetween ranks and classes, bringing the owners of land and the men\r\nof commerce more in harmony, it is not worth preserving. On the other\r\nhand it produces some of the worst features of conventionalism. It\r\ncultivates flunkeyism and servility, while operating as a restraint\r\nupon the manly expression of opinion. It fosters a spirit of spurious\r\naristocracy, which shows itself in contempt for men who prefer honest\r\nindustry to place-hunting and insolvent gentility.\r\n\r\nBut while I thus speak of the viceregal court as at present\r\nconstituted, I still maintain that, like Hungary, this country is\r\nso peculiarly situated, and is animated by so strong a spirit of\r\nnationality, that it ought to have a court of its own, and a sovereign\r\nof its own. The case of Hungary shows how easily this great boon might\r\nbe granted, and how gratifying the results would be to all the parties\r\nconcerned. The Queen ought to reside in Ireland for some portion of\r\nthe year. A suitable palace should be provided for the royal family.\r\nThe Prince of Wales, during her majesty's reign, ought to be the\r\npermanent Viceroy, with the necessary addition to his income. The\r\noffice would afford an excellent training for his duties as king. The\r\nattraction of the Princess of Wales would make the Irish court very\r\nbrilliant. It would afford the opportunity of contact with real\r\nroyalty, not the shadowy sort of thing we have had--reflected through\r\nViceroys very few of whom were ever _en rapport_ with the Irish\r\nnation. Not one of them could so speak to the people as to elicit a\r\nspark of enthusiasm. Of course they could not have the true ring of\r\nroyalty, for royalty was not in them. But they could not play the part\r\nwell. One simple sentence from the Queen or the Prince of Wales, or\r\neven from Prince Arthur, would be worth all the theatrical pomp\r\nthey could display in a generation. Those noblemen had no natural\r\nconnection with the kingdom, fitting them to take the first place\r\nin it. They were not hereditary chiefs. They were not elected by the\r\npeople. They were mere 'casual' chief-governors; and they formed\r\nno ties with the nation that could not be broken as easily as the\r\nspider's thread. The _hereditary principle_ has immense force in\r\nIreland. The landlords are now seeking to weaken it; or rather they\r\nare ignoring it altogether, and substituting the commercial principle\r\nin dealing with their tenants, preferring not the most devoted\r\nadherents of the family, but the man with most money. But I warn them\r\nthat they are doing so at the peril of their order. A prince who was\r\n_heir presumptive to the throne as Viceroy_, and who, when he ascended\r\nthe throne, should be crowned King of _Ireland_, as well as King of\r\nGreat Britain, crowned in his own Irish palace, and on the _Lia Fail_\r\nor stone of destiny, preserved at Westminster, would save many a\r\nmillion to the British exchequer, for it would be no longer necessary\r\nto support a large army of occupation to keep the country. If the\r\nthrone of Queen Victoria stood in Dublin, there is not a Fenian in\r\nIreland who would not die in its defence. Standing in Westminster it\r\nis doubtful whether its attraction is sufficient to retain the\r\nhearts even of Orangemen. There, it is the _English_ throne. So the\r\n_Englishman_ regards it with instinctive jealousy. He feels it is his\r\nown; but, say what we may, the Irish loyalist, when he approaches it,\r\nis made to feel, by a thousand signs, that he is a stranger and an\r\nintruder. He returns to his own bereaved country with a sad heart,\r\nand a bitter spirit. Can he be _Anglicised_? Put this question to\r\nan English philosopher, and he will answer with Mr. Froude--'Can the\r\nEthiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?' We can bridge\r\nthe channel with fast steamers; but who will bridge the gulf, hitherto\r\nimpassable, which separates the English Dives from the Irish Lazarus?\r\n\r\n'We have,' said Canning, 'for many years been erecting a mound--not to\r\nassist or improve, but to thwart nature; we have raised it high above\r\nthe waters, and it has stood there, frowning hostility and effecting\r\nseparation. In the course of time, however, the necessities of man,\r\nand the silent workings of nature, have conspired to break down this\r\nmighty structure, till there remains of it only a narrow isthmus,\r\nstanding\r\n\r\n  Between two kindred seas,\r\n  Which, mounting, viewed each other from afar,\r\n  And longed to meet.\r\n\r\nWhat then, shall be our conduct? Shall we attempt to repair\r\nthe breaches, and fortify the ruins? A hopeless and ungracious\r\nundertaking! Or shall we leave them to moulder away by time and\r\naccident--a sure but distant and thankless consummation; or, shall\r\nwe not rather cut away at once the isthmus that remains, allow free\r\ncourse to the current which has been artificially impeded, and float\r\nupon the mingling waves the ark of our glorious constitution?'\r\n\r\nMuch has been done since Canning's time to remove the narrow isthmus.\r\nEmancipation cut deep into it. The disestablishment of the Irish\r\nChurch submerged an immense portion of it. If Mr. Gladstone's land\r\nbill be equally effective, a breach will be made through which the\r\ntwo kindred seas will meet, and, in their commingling flux and reflux,\r\nwill quickly sweep away all minor obstacles to their perfect union. A\r\njust settlement of the land question will reconcile the two races, and\r\nclose the war of seven centuries. That is the rock against which the\r\ntwo nationalities have rushed in foaming breakers, lashed into fury\r\nby the storms of faction and bigotry. Remove the obstruction, and the\r\nworld would hear no more the roaring of the waters. Then would\r\nfloat peacefully upon the commingling waves the ark of our common\r\nconstitution, in which there would be neither Saxon nor Celt, neither\r\nEnglish nor Irish, neither Protestant nor Catholic, but one united,\r\nfree, and mighty people. Then might the Emperor of the French mark the\r\nepoch with the announcement--'England has done justice to Ireland!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY SPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE AND\r\nPARLIAMENT STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Land-War In Ireland (1870), by James Godkin",
