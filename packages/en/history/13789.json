In 1908 I read in the British Museum\r\nmany newspapers and journals for the years 1860-1865, and then planned a\r\nsurvey of English public opinion on the American Civil War. In the\r\nsucceeding years as a teacher at Stanford University, California, the\r\npublished diplomatic correspondence of Great Britain and of the United\r\nStates were studied in connection with instruction given in the field of\r\nBritish-American relations. Several of my students prepared excellent\r\ntheses on special topics and these have been acknowledged where used in\r\nthis work. Many distractions and other writing prevented the completion\r\nof my original plan; and fortunately, for when in 1913 I had at last\r\nbegun this work and had prepared three chapters, a letter was received\r\nfrom the late Charles Francis Adams inviting me to collaborate with him\r\nin preparing a \"Life\" of his father, the Charles Francis Adams who was\r\nAmerican Minister to Great Britain during the Civil War. Mr. Adams had\r\nrecently returned from England where he had given at Oxford University a\r\nseries of lectures on the Civil War and had been so fortunate as to\r\nobtain copies, made under the scholarly supervision of Mr. Worthington\r\nC. Ford, of a great mass of correspondence from the Foreign Office files\r\nin the Public Record Office and from the private papers in the\r\npossession of various families.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the year 1914 was spent with Mr. Adams at Washington\r\nand at South Lincoln, in preparing the \"Life.\" Two volumes were\r\ncompleted, the first by Mr. Adams carrying the story to 1848, the\r\nsecond by myself for the period 1848 to 1860. For the third volume I\r\nanalysed and organized the new materials obtained in England and we were\r\nabout to begin actual collaboration on the most vital period of the\r\n\"Life\" when Mr. Adams died, and the work was indefinitely suspended,\r\nprobably wisely, since any completion of the \"Life\" by me would have\r\nlacked that individual charm in historical writing so markedly\r\ncharacteristic of all that Mr. Adams did. The half-year spent with Mr.\r\nAdams was an inspiration and constitutes a precious memory.\r\n\r\nThe Great War interrupted my own historical work, but in 1920 I returned\r\nto the original plan of a work on \"Great Britain and the American Civil\r\nWar\" in the hope that the English materials obtained by Mr. Adams might\r\nbe made available to me. When copies were secured by Mr. Adams in 1913 a\r\nrestriction had been imposed by the Foreign Office to the effect that\r\nwhile studied for information, citations and quotations were not\r\npermissible since the general diplomatic archives were not yet open to\r\nstudents beyond the year 1859. Through my friend Sir Charles Lucas, the\r\nwhole matter was again presented to the Foreign Office, with an exact\r\nstatement that the new request was in no way related to the proposed\r\n\"Life\" of Charles Francis Adams, but was for my own use of the\r\nmaterials. Lord Curzon, then Foreign Secretary, graciously approved the\r\nrequest but with the usual condition that my manuscript be submitted\r\nbefore publication to the Foreign Office. This has now been done, and no\r\nsingle citation censored. Before this work will have appeared the\r\nlimitation hitherto imposed on diplomatic correspondence will have been\r\nremoved, and the date for open research have been advanced beyond 1865,\r\nthe end of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nSimilar explanations of my purpose and proposed work were made through\r\nmy friend Mr. Francis W. Hirst to the owners of various private papers,\r\nand prompt approval given. In 1924 I came to England for further study\r\nof some of these private papers. The Russell Papers, transmitted to the\r\nPublic Record Office in 1914 and there preserved, were used through the\r\ncourtesy of the Executors of the late Hon. Rollo Russell, and with the\r\nhearty goodwill of Lady Agatha Russell, daughter of the late Earl\r\nRussell, the only living representative of her father, Mr. Rollo\r\nRussell, his son, having died in 1914. The Lyons Papers, preserved in\r\nthe Muniment Room at Old Norfolk House, were used through the courtesy\r\nof the Duchess of Norfolk, who now represents her son who is a minor.\r\nThe Gladstone Papers, preserved at Hawarden Castle, were used through\r\nthe courtesy of the Gladstone Trustees. The few citations from the\r\nPalmerston Papers, preserved at Broadlands, were approved by\r\nLieut.-Colonel Wilfred Ashley, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to study these private papers has been invaluable for my\r\nwork. Shortly after returning from England in 1913 Mr. Worthington Ford\r\nwell said: \"The inside history of diplomatic relations between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain may be surmised from the official\r\narchives; the tinting and shading needed to complete the picture must be\r\nsought elsewhere.\" (Mass. Hist. Soc. _Proceedings_, XLVI, p. 478.) Mr.\r\nC.F. Adams declared (_ibid._, XLVII, p. 54) that without these papers\r\n\"... the character of English diplomacy at that time (1860-1865) cannot\r\nbe understood.... It would appear that the commonly entertained\r\nimpressions as to certain phases of international relations, and the\r\nproceedings and utterances of English public men during the progress of\r\nthe War of Secession, must be to some extent revised.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new English materials I have been fortunate in the\r\ngenerosity of my colleague at Stanford University, Professor Frank A.\r\nGolder, who has given to me transcripts, obtained at St. Petersburg in\r\n1914, of all Russian diplomatic correspondence on the Civil War. Many\r\nfriends have aided, by suggestion or by permitting the use of notes and\r\nmanuscripts, in the preparation of this work. I have sought to make due\r\nacknowledgment for such aid in my foot-notes. But in addition to those\r\nalready named, I should here particularly note the courtesy of the late\r\nMr. Gaillard Hunt for facilities given in the State Department at\r\nWashington, of Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, for the\r\ntranscript of the Correspondence of Mason and Slidell, Confederate\r\nCommissioners in Europe, and of Mr. Charles Moore, Chief of Manuscripts\r\nDivision, Library of Congress, for the use of the Schurz Papers\r\ncontaining copies of the despatches of Schleiden, Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Bremen at Washington during the Civil War. Especially thanks\r\nare due to my friend, Mr. Herbert Hoover, for his early interest in this\r\nwork and for his generous aid in the making of transcripts which would\r\notherwise have been beyond my means. And, finally, I owe much to the\r\nskill and care of my wife who made the entire typescript for the Press,\r\nand whose criticisms were invaluable.\r\n\r\nIt is no purpose of a Preface to indicate results, but it is my hope\r\nthat with, I trust, a \"calm comparison of the evidence,\" now for the\r\nfirst time available to the historian, a fairly true estimate may be\r\nmade of what the American Civil War meant to Great Britain; how she\r\nregarded it and how she reacted to it. In brief, my work is primarily a\r\nstudy in British history in the belief that the American drama had a\r\nworld significance, and peculiarly a British one.\r\n\r\nEPHRAIM DOUGLASS ADAMS.\r\n\r\n_November 25, 1924_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME ONE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n   I.

The historian, George Grote, could write: \"The\r\nperfect neutrality [of Great Britain] in this destructive war appears to\r\nme almost a phenomenon in political history. No such forbearance has\r\nbeen shown during the political history of the last two centuries. It is\r\nthe single case in which the English Government and public--generally so\r\nmeddlesome--have displayed most prudent and commendable forbearance in\r\nspite of great temptations to the contrary[2].\" And Sir William\r\nHarcourt, in September, 1863, declared: \"Among all Lord Russell's many\r\ntitles to fame and to public gratitude, the manner in which he has\r\nsteered the vessel of State through the Scylla and Charybdis of the\r\nAmerican War will, I think, always stand conspicuous[3].\"\r\n\r\nMinister Adams, in the later years of the Civil War, saw reason somewhat\r\nto modify his earlier judgment, but his indictment of Great Britain was\r\nlong prevalent in America, as, indeed, it was also among the historians\r\nand writers of Continental Europe--notably those of France and Russia.\r\nTo what extent was this dictum justified? Did Great Britain in spite of\r\nher long years of championship of personal freedom and of leadership in\r\nthe cause of anti-slavery seize upon the opportunity offered in the\r\ndisruption of the American Union, and forgetting humanitarian idealisms,\r\nreact only to selfish motives of commercial advantage and national\r\npower? In brief, how is the American Civil War to be depicted by\r\nhistorians of Great Britain, recording her attitude and action in both\r\nforeign and domestic policy, and revealing the principles of her\r\nstatesmen, or the inspirations of her people?\r\n\r\nIt was to answer this question that the present work was originally\r\nundertaken; but as investigation proceeded it became progressively more\r\nclear that the great crisis in America was almost equally a crisis in\r\nthe domestic history of Great Britain itself and that unless this were\r\nfully appreciated no just estimate was possible of British policy toward\r\nAmerica. Still more it became evident that the American Civil War, as\r\nseen through British spectacles, could not be understood if regarded as\r\nan isolated and unique situation, but that the conditions preceding that\r\nsituation--some of them lying far back in the relations of the two\r\nnations--had a vital bearing on British policy and opinion when the\r\ncrisis arose. No expanded examination of these preceding conditions is\r\nhere possible, but it is to a summary analysis of them that this first\r\nchapter is devoted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the American War for separation from the Mother Country it is\r\nunnecessary to dilate, though it should always be remembered that both\r\nduring the war and afterwards there existed a minority in Great Britain\r\nstrongly sympathetic with the political ideals proclaimed in\r\nAmerica--regarding those ideals, indeed, as something to be striven for\r\nin Britain itself and the conflict with America as, in a measure, a\r\nconflict in home politics. But independence once acknowledged by the\r\nTreaty of Peace of 1783, the relations between the Mother Country and\r\nthe newly-created United States of America rapidly tended to adjust\r\nthemselves to lines of contact customary between Great Britain and any\r\nother Sovereign State. Such contacts, fixing national attitude and\r\npolicy, ordinarily occur on three main lines: governmental, determined\r\nby officials in authority in either State whose duty it is to secure the\r\ngreatest advantage in power and prosperity for the State; commercial,\r\nresulting, primarily, from the interchange of goods and the business\r\nopportunities of either nation in the other's territory, or from their\r\nrivalry in foreign trade; idealistic, the result of comparative\r\ndevelopment especially in those ideals of political structure which\r\ndetermine the nature of the State and the form of its government. The\r\nmore obvious of these contacts is the governmental, since the attitude\r\nof a people is judged by the formal action of its Government, and,\r\nindeed, in all three lines of contact the government of a State is\r\ndirectly concerned and frequently active. But it may be of service to a\r\nclearer appreciation of British attitude and policy before 1860, if the\r\nintermingling of elements required by a strict chronological account of\r\nrelations is here replaced by a separate review of each of the three\r\nmain lines of contact.\r\n\r\nOnce independence had been yielded to the American Colonies, the\r\ninterest of the British Government rapidly waned in affairs American.\r\nTrue, there still remained the valued establishments in the West Indies,\r\nand the less considered British possessions on the continent to the\r\nnorth of the United States. Meanwhile, there were occasional frictions\r\nwith America arising from uncertain claims drawn from the former\r\ncolonial privileges of the new state, or from boundary contentions not\r\nsettled in the treaty of peace. Thus the use of the Newfoundland\r\nfisheries furnished ground for an acrimonious controversy lasting even\r\ninto the twentieth century, and occasionally rising to the danger point.\r\nBoundary disputes dragged along through official argument, survey\r\ncommissions, arbitration, to final settlement, as in the case of the\r\nnorthern limits of the State of Maine fixed at last by the Treaty of\r\nWashington of 1842, and then on lines fair to both sides at any time in\r\nthe forty years of legal bickering. Very early, in 1817, an agreement\r\ncreditable to the wisdom and pacific intentions of both countries, was\r\nreached establishing small and equal naval armaments on the Great Lakes.\r\nThe British fear of an American attack on Canada proved groundless as\r\ntime went on and was definitely set at rest by the strict curb placed by\r\nthe American Government upon the restless activities of such of its\r\ncitizens as sympathized with the followers of McKenzie and Papineau in\r\nthe Canadian rebellion of 1837[4].\r\n\r\nNone of these governmental contacts affected greatly the British policy\r\ntoward America. But the \"War of 1812,\" as it is termed in the United\r\nStates, \"Mr. Madison's War,\" as it was derisively named by Tory\r\ncontemporaries in Great Britain, arose from serious policies in which\r\nthe respective governments were in definite opposition. Briefly, this\r\nwas a clash between belligerent and neutral interests. Britain, fighting\r\nat first for the preservation of Europe against the spread of French\r\nrevolutionary influence, later against the Napoleonic plan of Empire,\r\nheld the seas in her grasp and exercised with vigour all the accustomed\r\nrights of a naval belligerent. Of necessity, from her point of view,\r\nand as always in the case of the dominant naval belligerent, she\r\nstretched principles of international law to their utmost interpretation\r\nto secure her victory in war. America, soon the only maritime neutral of\r\nimportance, and profiting greatly by her neutrality, contested point by\r\npoint the issue of exceeded belligerent right as established in\r\ninternational law. America did more; she advanced new rules and theories\r\nof belligerent and neutral right respectively, and demanded that the\r\nbelligerents accede to them. Dispute arose over blockades, contraband,\r\nthe British \"rule of 1756\" which would have forbidden American trade\r\nwith French colonies in war time, since such trade was prohibited by\r\nFrance herself in time of peace. But first and foremost as touching the\r\npersonal sensibilities and patriotism of both countries was the British\r\nexercise of a right of search and seizure to recover British sailors.\r\n\r\nMoreover this asserted right brought into clear view definitely opposed\r\ntheories as to citizenship. Great Britain claimed that a man once born a\r\nBritish subject could never cease to be a subject--could never \"alienate\r\nhis duty.\" It was her practice to fill up her navy, in part at least, by\r\nthe \"impressment\" of her sailor folk, taking them whenever needed, and\r\nwherever found--in her own coast towns, or from the decks of her own\r\nmercantile marine. But many British sailors sought security from such\r\nimpressment by desertion in American ports or were tempted to desert to\r\nAmerican merchant ships by the high pay obtainable in the\r\nrapidly-expanding United States merchant marine. Many became by\r\nnaturalization citizens of the United States, and it was the duty of\r\nAmerica to defend them as such in their lives and business. America\r\nultimately came to hold, in short, that expatriation was accomplished\r\nfrom Great Britain when American citizenship was conferred. On shore\r\nthey were safe, for Britain did not attempt to reclaim her subjects\r\nfrom the soil of another nation. But she denied that the American flag\r\non merchant vessels at sea gave like security and she asserted a naval\r\nright to search such vessels in time of peace, professing her complete\r\nacquiescence in a like right to the American navy over British merchant\r\nvessels--a concession refused by America, and of no practical value\r\nsince no American citizen sought service in the British merchant marine.\r\n\r\nThis \"right of search\" controversy involved then, two basic points of\r\nopposition between the two governments. First America contested the\r\nBritish theory of \"once a citizen always a citizen[5]\"; second, America\r\ndenied any right whatever to a foreign naval vessel in _time of peace_\r\nto stop and search a vessel lawfully flying the American flag. The\r\n_right of search in time of war_, that is, a belligerent right of\r\nsearch, America never denied, but there was both then and later much\r\npublic confusion in both countries as to the question at issue since,\r\nonce at war, Great Britain frequently exercised a legal belligerent\r\nright of search and followed it up by the seizure of sailors alleged to\r\nbe British subjects. Nor were British naval captains especially careful\r\nto make sure that no American-born sailors were included in their\r\nimpressment seizures, and as the accounts spread of victim after victim,\r\nthe American irritation steadily increased. True, France was also an\r\noffender, but as the weaker naval power her offence was lost sight of in\r\nview of the, literally, thousands of _bona fide_ Americans seized by\r\nGreat Britain. Here, then, was a third cause of irritation connected\r\nwith impressment, though not a point of governmental dispute as to\r\nright, for Great Britain professed her earnest desire to restore\r\npromptly any American-born sailors whom her naval officers had seized\r\nthrough error. In fact many such sailors were soon liberated, but a\r\nlarge number either continued to serve on British ships or to languish\r\nin British prisons until the end of the Napoleonic Wars[6].\r\n\r\nThere were other, possibly greater, causes of the War of 1812, most of\r\nthem arising out of the conflicting interests of the chief maritime\r\nneutral and the chief naval belligerent. The pacific presidential\r\nadministration of Jefferson sought by trade restrictions, using embargo\r\nand non-intercourse acts, to bring pressure on both England and France,\r\nhoping to force a better treatment of neutrals. The United States,\r\ndivided in sympathy between the belligerents, came near to disorder and\r\ndisruption at home, over the question of foreign policy. But through all\r\nAmerican factions there ran the feeling of growing animosity to Great\r\nBritain because of impressment. At last, war was declared by America in\r\n1812 and though at the moment bitterly opposed by one section, New\r\nEngland, that war later came to be regarded as of great national value\r\nas one of the factors which welded the discordant states into a national\r\nunity. Naturally also, the war once ended, its commercial causes were\r\nquickly forgotten, whereas the individual, personal offence involved in\r\nimpressment and right of search, with its insult to national pride,\r\nbecame a patriotic theme for politicians and for the press. To deny, in\r\nfact, a British \"right of search\" became a national point of honour,\r\nupon which no American statesman would have dared to yield to British\r\novertures.\r\n\r\nIn American eyes the War of 1812 appears as a \"second war of\r\nIndependence\" and also as of international importance in contesting an\r\nunjust use by Britain of her control of the seas. Also, it is to be\r\nremembered that no other war of importance was fought by America until\r\nthe Mexican War of 1846, and militant patriotism was thus centred on the\r\ntwo wars fought against Great Britain. The contemporary British view\r\nwas that of a nation involved in a life and death struggle with a great\r\nEuropean enemy, irritated by what seemed captious claims, developed to\r\nwar, by a minor power[7]. To be sure there were a few obstinate Tories\r\nin Britain who saw in the war the opportunity of smashing at one blow\r\nNapoleon's dream of empire, and the American \"democratic system.\" The\r\nLondon _Times_ urged the government to \"finish with Mr. Bonaparte and\r\nthen deal with Mr. Madison and democracy,\" arguing that it should be\r\nEngland's object to subvert \"the whole system of the Jeffersonian\r\nschool.\" But this was not the purpose of the British Government, nor\r\nwould such a purpose have been tolerated by the small but vigorous Whig\r\nminority in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1814, signed at Ghent, merely declared an end of the war,\r\nquietly ignoring all the alleged causes of the conflict. Impressment was\r\nnot mentioned, but it was never again resorted to by Great Britain upon\r\nAmerican ships. But the principle of right of search in time of peace,\r\nthough for another object than impressment, was soon again asserted by\r\nGreat Britain and for forty years was a cause of constant irritation and\r\na source of danger in the relations of the two countries. Stirred by\r\nphilanthropic emotion Great Britain entered upon a world crusade for the\r\nsuppression of the African Slave Trade. All nations in principle\r\nrepudiated that trade and Britain made treaties with various maritime\r\npowers giving mutual right of search to the naval vessels of each upon\r\nthe others' merchant vessels. The African Slave Trade was in fact\r\noutlawed for the flags of all nations. But America, smarting under the\r\nmemory of impressment injuries, and maintaining in any case the doctrine\r\nthat in time of peace the national flag protected a vessel from\r\ninterference or search by the naval vessels of any other power, refused\r\nto sign mutual right of search treaties and denied, absolutely, such a\r\nright for any cause whatever to Great Britain or to any other nation.\r\nBeing refused a treaty, Britain merely renewed her assertion of the\r\nright and continued to exercise it.\r\n\r\nThus the right of search in time of peace controversy was not ended with\r\nthe war of 1812 but remained a constant sore in national relations, for\r\nBritain alone used her navy with energy to suppress the slave trade, and\r\nthe slave traders of all nations sought refuge, when approached by a\r\nBritish naval vessel, under the protection of the American flag. If\r\nBritain respected the flag, and sheered off from search, how could she\r\nstop the trade? If she ignored the flag and on boarding found an\r\ninnocent American vessel engaged in legal trade, there resulted claims\r\nfor damages by detention of voyage, and demands by the American\r\nGovernment for apology and reparation. The real slave trader, seized\r\nunder the American flag, never protested to the United States, nor\r\nclaimed American citizenship, for his punishment in American law for\r\nengaging in the slave trade was death, while under the law of any other\r\nnation it did not exceed imprisonment, fine and loss of his vessel.\r\n\r\nSummed up in terms of governmental attitude the British contention was\r\nthat here was a great international humanitarian object frustrated by an\r\nabsurd American sensitiveness on a point of honour about the flag. After\r\nfifteen years of dispute Great Britain offered to abandon any claim to a\r\nright of _search_, contenting herself with a right of _visit_, merely to\r\nverify a vessel's right to fly the American flag. America asserted this\r\nto be mere pretence, involving no renunciation of a practice whose\r\nlegality she denied. In 1842, in the treaty settling the Maine boundary\r\ncontroversy, the eighth article sought a method of escape. Joint\r\ncruising squadrons were provided for the coast of Africa, the British\r\nto search all suspected vessels except those flying the American flag,\r\nand these to be searched by the American squadron. At once President\r\nTyler notified Congress that Great Britain had renounced the right of\r\nsearch. Immediately in Parliament a clamour was raised against the\r\nGovernment for the \"sacrifice\" of a British right at sea, and Lord\r\nAberdeen promptly made official disclaimer of such surrender.\r\n\r\nThus, heritage of the War of 1812 right of search in time of peace was a\r\nsteady irritant. America doubted somewhat the honesty of Great Britain,\r\nappreciating in part the humanitarian purpose, but suspicious of an\r\nulterior \"will to rule the seas.\" After 1830 no American political\r\nleader would have dared to yield the right of search. Great Britain for\r\nher part, viewing the expansion of domestic slavery in the United\r\nStates, came gradually to attribute the American contention, not to\r\npatriotic pride, but to the selfish business interests of the\r\nslave-holding states. In the end, in 1858, with a waning British\r\nenthusiasm for the cause of slave trade suppression, and with\r\nrecognition that America had become a great world power, Britain yielded\r\nher claim to right of search or visit, save when established by Treaty.\r\nFour years later, in 1862, it may well have seemed to British statesmen\r\nthat American slavery had indeed been the basic cause of America's\r\nattitude, for in that year a treaty was signed by the two nations giving\r\nmutual right of search for the suppression of the African Slave Trade.\r\nIn fact, however, this was but an effort by Seward, Secretary of State\r\nfor the North, to influence British and European opinion against the\r\nseceding slave states of the South.\r\n\r\nThe right of search controversy was, in truth, ended when American power\r\nreached a point where the British Government must take it seriously into\r\naccount as a factor in general world policy. That power had been\r\nsteadily and rapidly advancing since 1814. From almost the first moment\r\nof established independence American statesmen visualized the\r\nseparation of the interests of the western continent from those of\r\nEurope, and planned for American leadership in this new world.\r\nWashington, the first President, emphasized in his farewell address the\r\ndanger of entangling alliances with Europe. For long the nations of\r\nEurope, immersed in Continental wars, put aside their rivalries in this\r\nnew world. Britain, for a time, neglected colonial expansion westward,\r\nbut in 1823, in an emergency of European origin when France,\r\ncommissioned by the great powers of continental Europe, intervened in\r\nSpain to restore the deposed Bourbon monarchy and seemed about to\r\nintervene in Spanish America to restore to Spain her revolted colonies,\r\nthere developed in Great Britain a policy, seemingly about to draw\r\nAmerica and England into closer co-operation. Canning, for Britain,\r\nproposed to America a joint declaration against French intervention in\r\nthe Americas. His argument was against the principle of intervention;\r\nhis immediate motive was a fear of French colonial expansion; but his\r\nultimate object was inheritance by Britain of Spain's dying influence\r\nand position in the new world.\r\n\r\nCanning's overture was earnestly considered in America. The\r\nex-Presidents, Jefferson and Madison, recommended its acceptance, but\r\nthe Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, opposed this, favouring\r\nrather a separate declaration by the United States, and of this opinion\r\nwas also President Monroe. Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine announcing\r\nAmerican opposition to the principle of \"intervention,\" and declaring\r\nthat the American continents were no longer to be regarded as open to\r\nfurther colonization by European nations. The British emergency\r\nsituation with France, though already quieted, caused Monroe's Message\r\nto be greeted in England with high approval. But Canning did not so\r\napprove it for he saw clearly that the Monroe Doctrine was a challenge\r\nnot merely to continental Europe, but to England as well and he set\r\nhimself to thwart this threatening American policy. Had Canning's policy\r\nbeen followed by later British statesmen there would have resulted a\r\nserious clash with the United States[8].\r\n\r\nIn fact the Monroe Doctrine, imposing on Europe a self-denying policy of\r\nnon-colonial expansion toward the west, provided for the United States\r\nthe medium, if she wished to use it, for her own expansion in territory\r\nand in influence. But for a time there was no need of additional\r\nterritory for that already hers stretched from the Atlantic to the Rocky\r\nMountains, two-thirds of the way from ocean to ocean. Her population was\r\ngrowing fast. But four millions at the time of the Revolution, there\r\nwere thirteen millions in 1830, and of these nearly a third were already\r\nacross the Appalachian range and were constantly pressing on towards new\r\nlands in the South and West. The Monroe Doctrine was the first definite\r\nnotice given to Europe of America's preconceived \"destiny,\" but the\r\nearlier realization of that destiny took place on lines of expansion\r\nwithin her own boundaries. To this there could be no governmental\r\nobjection, whether by Great Britain or any other nation.\r\n\r\nBut when in the decade 1840 to 1850, the United States, to the view of\r\nBritish statesmen, suddenly startled the world by entering upon a policy\r\nof further territorial expansion, forsaking her peaceful progress and\r\nturning toward war, there was a quick determination on a line of British\r\npolicy as regards the American advance. The first intimation of the new\r\nAmerican policy came in relation to the State of Texas which had\r\nrevolted from Mexico in 1836, and whose independence had been generally\r\nrecognized by 1842. To this new state Britain sent diplomatic and\r\nconsular agents and these reported two factions among the people--one\r\nseeking admission to the American Union, one desiring the maintenance\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Aberdeen had sent Lord Ashburton to America with instructions to\r\nsecure, if possible, a settlement of all matters in dispute. Here was a\r\ngenuine British effort to escape from national irritations. But before\r\nthe Treaty of 1842 was signed, even while it was in the earlier stages\r\nof negotiation, the British Government saw, with alarm, quite new\r\nquestions arising, preventing, to its view, that harmonious relation\r\nwith the United States the desire for which had led to the Ashburton\r\nmission. This new development was the appearance of an American fever\r\nfor territorial expansion, turning first toward Texas, but soon voiced\r\nas a \"manifest destiny\" which should carry American power and\r\ninstitutions to the Pacific and even into Central America. Among these\r\ninstitutions was that of slavery, detested by the public of Great\r\nBritain, yet a delicate matter for governmental consideration since the\r\ngreat cotton manufacturing interests drew the bulk of their supplies of\r\nraw cotton from the slave-holding states of America. If Texas, herself a\r\ncotton state, should join the United States, dependence upon slave-grown\r\ncotton would be intensified. Also, Texas, once acquired, what was there\r\nto prevent further American exploitation, followed by slave expansion,\r\ninto Mexico, where for long British influence had been dominant?\r\n\r\nOn the fate of Texas, therefore, centred for a time the whole British\r\npolicy toward America. Pakenham, the British minister to Mexico, urged a\r\nBritish pressure on Mexico to forgo her plans of reconquering Texas, and\r\nstrong British efforts to encourage Texas in maintaining her\r\nindependence. His theory foreshadowed a powerful buffer Anglo-Saxon\r\nstate, prohibiting American advance to the south-west, releasing Britain\r\nfrom dependence on American cotton, and ultimately, he hoped, leading\r\nTexas to abolish slavery, not yet so rooted as to be ineradicable. This\r\npolicy was approved by the British Government, Pakenham was sent to\r\nWashington to watch events, a _chargé_, Elliot, was despatched to Texas,\r\nand from London lines were cast to draw France into the plan and to\r\nforce the acquiescence of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn this brief account of main lines of governmental contacts, it is\r\nunnecessary to recite the details of the diplomatic conflict, for such\r\nit became, with sharp antagonisms manifested on both sides. The basic\r\nfact was that America was bent upon territorial expansion, and that\r\nGreat Britain set herself to thwart this ambition. But not to the point\r\nof war. Aberdeen was so incautious at one moment as to propose to France\r\nand Mexico a triple guarantee of the independence of Texas, if that\r\nstate would acquiesce, but when Pakenham notified him that in this case,\r\nBritain must clearly understand that war with America was not merely\r\npossible, but probable, Aberdeen hastened to withdraw the plan of\r\nguarantee, fortunately not yet approved by Mexico[9].\r\n\r\nThe solution of this diplomatic contest thus rested with Texas. Did she\r\nwish annexation to the United States, or did she prefer independence?\r\nElliot, in Texas, hoped to the last moment that Texas would choose\r\nindependence and British favour. But the people of the new state were\r\nlargely emigrants from the United States, and a majority of them wished\r\nto re-enter the Union, a step finally accomplished in 1846, after ten\r\nyears of separate existence as a Republic. The part played by the\r\nBritish Government in this whole episode was not a fortunate one. It is\r\nthe duty of Governments to watch over the interests of their subjects,\r\nand to guard the prestige and power of the state. Great Britain had a\r\nperfect _right_ to take whatever steps she chose to take in regard to\r\nTexas, but the steps taken appeared to Americans to be based upon a\r\npolicy antagonistic to the American expansion policy of the moment. The\r\nGovernment of Great Britain appeared, indeed, to have adopted a policy\r\nof preventing the development of the power of the United States. Then,\r\nfronted with war, she had meekly withdrawn. The basic British public\r\nfeeling, fixing the limits of governmental policy, of never again being\r\ndrawn into war with America, not because of fear, but because of\r\nimportant trade relations and also because of essential liking and\r\nadmiration, in spite of surface antagonisms, was not appreciated in\r\nAmerica. Lord Aberdeen indeed, and others in governmental circles,\r\npleaded that the support of Texan independence was in reality perfectly\r\nin harmony with the best interests of the United States, since it would\r\nhave tended toward the limitation of American slavery. And in the matter\r\nof national power, they consoled themselves with prophecies that the\r\nAmerican Union, now so swollen in size, must inevitably split into two,\r\nperhaps three, rival empires, a slave-holding one in the South, free\r\nnations in North and West.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Texas sealed, Britain soon definitely abandoned all\r\nopposition to American expansion unless it were to be attempted\r\nnorthwards, though prophesying evil for the American madness. Mexico,\r\nrelying on past favours, and because of a sharp controversy between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain over the Oregon territory, expected\r\nBritish aid in her war of 1846 against America. But she was sharply\r\nwarned that such aid would not be given, and the Oregon dispute was\r\nsettled in the Anglo-Saxon fashion of vigorous legal argument, followed\r\nby a fair compromise. The Mexican war resulted in the acquisition of\r\nCalifornia by the United States. British agents in this province of\r\nMexico, and British admirals on the Pacific were cautioned to take no\r\nactive steps in opposition.\r\n\r\nThus British policy, after Texan annexation, offered no barrier to\r\nAmerican expansion, and much to British relief the fear of the extension\r\nof the American plans to Mexico and Central America was not realized.\r\nThe United States was soon plunged, as British statesmen had prophesied,\r\ninto internal conflict over the question whether the newly-acquired\r\nterritories should be slave or free.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of California brought up a new problem of quick transit\r\nbetween Atlantic and Pacific, and a canal was planned across Central\r\nAmerica. Here Britain and America acted together, at first in amity,\r\nthough the convention signed in 1850 later developed discord as to the\r\nBritish claim of a protectorate over the Atlantic end of the proposed\r\ncanal at San Juan del Nicaragua. But Britain was again at war in Europe\r\nin the middle 'fifties, and America was deep in quarrel over slavery at\r\nhome. On both sides in spite of much diplomatic intrigue and of\r\nmanifestations of national pride there was governmental desire to avoid\r\ndifficulties. At the end of the ten-year period Britain ceded to\r\nNicaragua her protectorate in the canal zone, and all causes of\r\nfriction, so reported President Buchanan to Congress in 1860, were\r\nhappily removed. Britain definitely altered her policy of opposition to\r\nthe growth of American power.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, then, the causes of governmental antagonisms were seemingly all\r\nat an end. Impressment was not used after 1814. The differing theories\r\nof the two Governments on British expatriation still remained, but\r\nBritain attempted no practical application of her view. The right of\r\nsearch in time of peace controversy, first eased by the plan of joint\r\ncruising, had been definitely settled by the British renunciation of\r\n1858. Opposition to American territorial advance but briefly manifested\r\nby Britain, had ended with the annexation of Texas, and the fever of\r\nexpansion had waned in America. Minor disputes in Central America,\r\nrelated to the proposed canal, were amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nBut differences between nations, varying view-points of peoples,\r\nfrequently have deeper currents than the more obvious frictions in\r\ngovernmental act or policy, nor can governments themselves fail to react\r\nto such less evident causes. It is necessary to review the commercial\r\nrelations of the two nations--later to examine their political ideals.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 America won her independence in government from a colonial\r\nstatus. But commercially she remained a British colony--yet with a\r\ndifference. She had formed a part of the British colonial system. All\r\nher normal trade was with the mother country or with other British\r\ncolonies. Now her privileges in such trade were at an end, and she must\r\nseek as a favour that which had formerly been hers as a member of the\r\nBritish Empire. The direct trade between England and America was easily\r\nand quickly resumed, for the commercial classes of both nations desired\r\nit and profited by it. But the British colonial system prohibited trade\r\nbetween a foreign state and British colonies and there was one channel\r\nof trade, to and from the British West Indies, long very profitable to\r\nboth sides, during colonial times, but now legally hampered by American\r\nindependence. The New England States had lumber, fish, and farm products\r\ndesired by the West Indian planters, and these in turn offered needed\r\nsugar, molasses, and rum. Both parties desired to restore the trade, and\r\nin spite of the legal restrictions of the colonial system, the trade was\r\nin fact resumed in part and either permitted or winked at by the British\r\nGovernment, but never to the advantageous exchange of former times.\r\n\r\nThe acute stage of controversy over West Indian trade was not reached\r\nuntil some thirty years after American Independence, but the uncertainty\r\nof such trade during a long period in which a portion of it consisted\r\nin unauthorized and unregulated exchange was a constant irritant to all\r\nparties concerned. Meanwhile there came the War of 1812 with its\r\npreliminary check upon direct trade to and from Great Britain, and its\r\nfinal total prohibition of intercourse during the war itself. In 1800\r\nthe bulk of American importation of manufactures still came from Great\r\nBritain. In the contest over neutral rights and theories, Jefferson\r\nattempted to bring pressure on the belligerents, and especially on\r\nEngland, by restriction of imports. First came a non-importation Act,\r\n1806, followed by an embargo on exports, 1807, but these were so\r\nunpopular in the commercial states of New England that they were\r\nwithdrawn in 1810, yet for a short time only, for Napoleon tricked the\r\nUnited States into believing that France had yielded to American\r\ncontentions on neutral rights, and in 1811 non-intercourse was\r\nproclaimed again with England alone. On June 18, 1812, America finally\r\ndeclared war and trade stopped save in a few New England ports where\r\nrebellious citizens continued to sell provisions to a blockading British\r\nnaval squadron.\r\n\r\nFor eight years after 1806, then, trade with Great Britain had steadily\r\ndecreased, finally almost to extinction during the war. But America\r\nrequired certain articles customarily imported and necessity now forced\r\nher to develop her own manufactures. New England had been the centre of\r\nAmerican foreign commerce, but now there began a trend toward\r\nmanufacturing enterprise. Even in 1814, however, at the end of the war,\r\nit was still thought in the United States that under normal conditions\r\nmanufactured goods would again be imported and the general cry of\r\n\"protection for home industries\" was as yet unvoiced. Nevertheless, a\r\ngroup of infant industries had in fact been started and clamoured for\r\ndefence now that peace was restored. This situation was not unnoticed in\r\nGreat Britain where merchants, piling up goods in anticipation of peace\r\non the continent of Europe and a restored market, suddenly discovered\r\nthat the poverty of Europe denied them that market. Looking with\r\napprehension toward the new industries of America, British merchants,\r\nfollowing the advice of Lord Brougham in a parliamentary speech, dumped\r\ngreat quantities of their surplus goods on the American market, selling\r\nthem far below cost, or even on extravagant credit terms. One object was\r\nto smash the budding American manufactures.\r\n\r\nThis action of British merchants naturally stirred some angry patriotic\r\nemotions in the circles where American business suffered and a demand\r\nbegan to be heard for protection. But the Government of the United\r\nStates was still representative of agriculture, in the main, and while a\r\nTariff Bill was enacted in 1816 that Bill was regarded as a temporary\r\nmeasure required by the necessity of paying the costs of the recent war.\r\nJust at this juncture, however, British policy, now looking again toward\r\na great colonial empire, sought advantages for the hitherto neglected\r\nmaritime provinces of British North America, and thought that it had\r\nfound them by encouragement of their trade with the British West Indies.\r\nThe legal status of American trade with the West Indies was now enforced\r\nand for a time intercourse was practically suspended.\r\n\r\nThis British policy brought to the front the issue of protection in\r\nAmerica. It not only worked against a return by New England from\r\nmanufacturing to commerce, but it soon brought into the ranks of\r\nprotectionists a northern and western agricultural element that had been\r\naccustomed to sell surplus products to West Indian planters seeking\r\ncheap food-stuffs for their slaves. This new protectionist element was\r\nas yet not crystallized into a clamour for \"home markets\" for\r\nagriculture, but the pressure of opinion was beginning to be felt, and\r\nby 1820 the question of West Indian trade became one of constant\r\nagitation and demanded political action. That action was taken on lines\r\nof retaliation. Congress in 1818 passed a law excluding from American\r\nports any British vessel coming from a port access to which was denied\r\nto an American vessel, and placing under bond in American ports British\r\nvessels with prohibition of their proceeding to a British port to which\r\nAmerican vessels could not go. This act affected not merely direct trade\r\nwith the West Indies, but stopped the general custom of British ships of\r\ntaking part cargoes to Jamaica while _en route_ to and from the United\r\nStates. The result was, first, compromise, later, under Huskisson's\r\nadministration at the British Board of Trade, complete abandonment by\r\nBritain of the exclusive trade basis of her whole colonial system.\r\n\r\nThe \"retaliatory system\" which J.Q. Adams regarded as \"a new declaration\r\nof independence,\" was, in fact, quickly taken up by other non-colonial\r\nnations, and these, with America, compelled Great Britain to take stock\r\nof her interests. Huskisson, rightly foreseeing British prosperity as\r\ndependent upon her manufactures and upon the carrying trade, stated in\r\nParliament that American \"retaliation\" had forced the issue. Freedom of\r\ntrade in British ports was offered in 1826 to all non-colonial nations\r\nthat would open their ports within one year on terms of equality to\r\nBritish ships. J.Q. Adams, now President of the United States, delayed\r\nacceptance of this offer, preferring a treaty negotiation, and was\r\nrebuffed by Canning, so that actual resumption of West Indian trade did\r\nnot take place until 1830, after the close of Adams' administration.\r\nThat trade never recovered its former prosperity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the long period of controversy, from 1806 to 1830, had\r\nresulted in a complete change in the American situation. It is not a\r\nsufficient explanation of the American belief in, and practice of, the\r\ntheory of protection to attribute this alone to British checks placed\r\nupon free commercial rivalry. Nevertheless the progress of America\r\ntoward an established system, reaching its highest mark for years in the\r\nTariff Bill of 1828, is distinctly related to the events just narrated.\r\nAfter American independence, the partially illegal status of West Indian\r\ntrade hampered commercial progress and slightly encouraged American\r\nmanufactures by the mere seeking of capital for investment; the neutral\r\ntroubles of 1806 and the American prohibitions on intercourse increased\r\nthe transfer of interest; the war of 1812 gave a complete protection to\r\ninfant industries; the dumping of British goods in 1815 stirred\r\npatriotic American feeling; British renewal of colonial system\r\nrestrictions, and the twelve-year quarrel over \"retaliation\" gave time\r\nfor the definite establishment of protectionist ideas in the United\r\nStates. But Britain was soon proclaiming for herself and for the world\r\nthe common advantage and the justice of a great theory of free trade.\r\nAmerica was apparently now committed to an opposing economic theory, the\r\nfirst great nation definitely to establish it, and thus there resulted a\r\nclear-cut opposition of principle and a clash of interests. From 1846,\r\nwhen free trade ideas triumphed in England, the devoted British free\r\ntrader regarded America as the chief obstacle to a world-wide acceptance\r\nof his theory.\r\n\r\nThe one bright spot in America, as regarded by the British free trader,\r\nwas in the Southern States, where cotton interests, desiring no\r\nadvantage from protection, since their market was in Europe, attacked\r\nAmerican protection and sought to escape from it. Also slave supplies,\r\nwithout protection, could have been purchased more cheaply from England\r\nthan from the manufacturing North. In 1833 indeed the South had forced a\r\nreaction against protection, but it proceeded slowly. In 1854 it was\r\nSouthern opinion that carried through Congress the reciprocity treaty\r\nwith the British American Provinces, partly brought about, no doubt, by\r\na Southern fear that Canada, bitter over the loss of special advantages\r\nin British markets by the British free trade of 1846, might join the\r\nUnited States and thus swell the Northern and free states of the Union.\r\nCotton interests and trade became the dominant British commercial tie\r\nwith the United States, and the one great hope, to the British minds, of\r\na break in the false American system of protection. Thus both in\r\neconomic theory and in trade, spite of British dislike of slavery, the\r\nexport trading interests of Great Britain became more and more directed\r\ntoward the Southern States of America. Adding powerfully to this was the\r\ndependence of British cotton manufactures upon the American supply. The\r\nBritish trade attitude, arising largely outside of direct governmental\r\ncontacts, was bound to have, nevertheless, a constant and important\r\ninfluence on governmental action.\r\n\r\nGovernmental policy, seeking national power, conflicting trade and\r\nindustrial interests, are the favourite themes of those historians who\r\nregard nations as determined in their relations solely by economic\r\ncauses--by what is called \"enlightened self-interest.\" But governments,\r\nno matter how arbitrary, and still more if in a measure resting on\r\nrepresentation, react both consciously and unconsciously to a public\r\nopinion not obviously based upon either national or commercial rivalry.\r\nSometimes, indeed, governmental attitude runs absolutely counter to\r\npopular attitude in international affairs. In such a case, the\r\nhistorical estimate, if based solely on evidences of governmental\r\naction, is a false one and may do great injustice to the essential\r\nfriendliness of a people.\r\n\r\nHow then, did the British people, of all classes, regard America before\r\n1860, and in what manner did that regard affect the British Government?\r\nHere, it is necessary to seek British opinion on, and its reaction to,\r\nAmerican institutions, ideals, and practices. Such public opinion can\r\nbe found in quantity sufficient to base an estimate only in travellers'\r\nbooks, in reviews, and in newspapers of the period. When all these are\r\nbrought together it is found that while there was an almost universal\r\nBritish criticism of American social customs and habits of life, due to\r\nthat insularity of mental attitude characteristic of every nation,\r\nmaking it prefer its own customs and criticize those of its neighbours,\r\nsummed up in the phrase \"dislike of foreigners\"--it is found that\r\nBritish opinion was centred upon two main threads; first America as a\r\nplace for emigration and, second, American political ideals and\r\ninstitutions[10].\r\n\r\nBritish emigration to America, a governmentally favoured colonization\r\nprocess before the American revolution, lost that favour after 1783,\r\nthough not at first definitely opposed. But emigration still continued\r\nand at no time, save during the war of 1812, was it absolutely stopped.\r\nIts exact amount is unascertainable, for neither Government kept\r\nadequate statistics before 1820. With the end of the Napoleonic wars\r\nthere came great distress in England from which the man of energy sought\r\nescape. He turned naturally to America, being familiar, by hearsay at\r\nleast, with stories of the ease of gaining a livelihood there, and\r\ninfluenced by the knowledge that in the United States he would find\r\npeople of his own blood and speech. The bulk of this earlier emigration\r\nto America resulted from economic causes. When, in 1825, one energetic\r\nMember of Parliament, Wilmot Horton, induced the Government to appoint a\r\ncommittee to investigate the whole subject, the result was a mass of\r\ntestimony, secured from returned emigrants or from their letters home,\r\nin which there constantly appeared one main argument influencing the\r\nlabourer type of emigrant; he got good wages, and he was supplied, as a\r\nfarm hand, with good food. Repeatedly he testifies that he had \"three\r\nmeat meals a day,\" whereas in England he had ordinarily received but one\r\nsuch meal a week.\r\n\r\nMere good living was the chief inducement for the labourer type of\r\nemigrant, and the knowledge of such living created for this type\r\nremaining in England a sort of halo of industrial prosperity surrounding\r\nAmerica. But there was a second testimony brought out by Horton's\r\nCommittee, less general, yet to be picked up here and there as evidence\r\nof another argument for emigration to America. The labourer did not\r\ndilate upon political equality, nor boast of a share in government,\r\nindeed generally had no such share, but he did boast to his fellows at\r\nhome of the social equality, though not thus expressing it, which was\r\nall about him. He was a common farm hand, yet he \"sat down to meals\"\r\nwith his employer and family, and worked in the fields side by side with\r\nhis \"master.\" This, too, was an astounding difference to the mind of the\r\nBritish labourer. Probably for him it created a clearer, if not\r\naltogether universal and true picture of the meaning of American\r\ndemocracy than would have volumes of writing upon political\r\ninstitutions. Gradually there was established in the lower orders of\r\nBritish society a visualization of America as a haven of physical\r\nwell-being and personal social happiness.\r\n\r\nThis British labouring class had for long, however, no medium of\r\nexpression in print. Here existed, then, an unexpressed public opinion\r\nof America, of much latent influence, but for the moment largely\r\nnegligible as affecting other classes or the Government. A more\r\nimportant emigrating class in its influence on opinion at home, though\r\nnot a large class, was composed about equally of small farmers and small\r\nmerchants facing ruin in the agricultural and trading crises that\r\nfollowed the end of the European war. The British travellers' books\r\nfrom 1810 to 1820 are generally written by men of this class, or by\r\nagents sent out from co-operative groups planning emigration. Generally\r\nthey were discontented with political conditions at home, commonly\r\nopposed to a petrified social order, and attracted to the United States\r\nby its lure of prosperity and content. The books are, in brief, a\r\nsuperior type of emigrant guide for a superior type of emigrant,\r\nexamining and emphasizing industrial opportunity.\r\n\r\nAlmost universally, however, they sound the note of superior political\r\ninstitutions and conditions. One wrote \"A republican finds here A\r\nRepublic, and the only Republic on the face of the earth that ever\r\ndeserved the name: where all are under the protection of equal laws; of\r\nlaws made by Themselves[11].\" Another, who established an English colony\r\nin the Western States of Illinois, wrote of England that he objected to\r\n\"being ruled and taxed by people who had no more right to rule and tax\r\nus than consisted in the power to do it.\" And of his adopted country he\r\nconcludes: \"I love the Government; and thus a novel sensation is\r\nexcited; it is like the development of a new faculty. I am become a\r\npatriot in my old age[12].\" Still another detailed the points of his\r\ncontent, \"I am here, lord and master of myself and of 100 acres of\r\nland--an improvable farm, little trouble to me, good society and a good\r\nmarket, and, I think, a fine climate, only a little too hot and dry in\r\nsummer; the parson gets nothing from me; my state and road taxes and\r\npoor rates amount to §25.00 per annum. I can carry a gun if I choose; I\r\nleave my door unlocked at night; and I can get snuff for one cent an\r\nounce or a little more[13].\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first days of the American colonial movement toward\r\nindependence there had been, indeed, a British interest in American\r\npolitical principles. Many Whigs sympathized with these principles for\r\nreasons of home political controversy. Their sympathy continued after\r\nAmerican independence and by its insistent expression brought out\r\nequally insistent opposition from Tory circles. The British home\r\nmovement toward a more representative Government had been temporarily\r\nchecked by the extremes into which French Liberalism plunged in 1791,\r\ncausing reaction in England. By 1820 pressure was again being exerted by\r\nBritish Liberals of intelligence, and they found arguments in such\r\nreports as those just quoted. From that date onward, and especially just\r\nbefore the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet always a factor, the\r\nexample of a prosperous American democracy was an element in British\r\nhome politics, lauded or derided as the man in England desired or not an\r\nexpansion of the British franchise. In the earlier period, however, it\r\nis to be remembered that applause of American institutions did not mean\r\nacceptance of democracy to the extent of manhood franchise, for no such\r\nfranchise at first existed in America itself. The debate in England was\r\nsimply whether the step forward in American democracy, was an argument\r\nfor a similar step in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBooks, reviews and newspapers in Great Britain as the political quarrel\r\nthere grew in force, depicted America favourably or otherwise according\r\nto political sympathies at home. Both before and after the Reform Bill\r\nof 1832 this type of effort to mould opinion, by citation of America,\r\nwas widespread. Hence there is in such writing, not so much the\r\nexpression of public opinion, as of propaganda to affect that opinion.\r\nBook upon book, review upon review, might be quoted to illustrate this,\r\nbut a few notable examples will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe most widely read and reviewed book on the United States before\r\n1840, except the humorous and flippant characterization of America by\r\nMrs. Trollope, was Captain Basil Hall's three-volume work, published in\r\n1829[14]. Claiming an open mind, he expected for his adverse findings a\r\nreadier credence. For adverse to American political institutions these\r\nfindings are in all their larger applications. In every line Hall\r\nbetrays himself as an old Tory of the 'twenties, fixed in his belief,\r\nand convinced of the perfection and unalterableness of the British\r\nConstitution. Captain Hamilton, who wrote in 1833, was more frank in\r\navowal of a purpose[15]. He states in his preface:\r\n\r\n     \"... When I found the institutions and experiences of the\r\n     United States deliberately quoted in the reformed parliament,\r\n     as affording safe precedent for British legislation, and\r\n     learned that the drivellers who uttered such nonsense,\r\n     instead of encountering merited derision, were listened to\r\n     with patience and approbation by men as ignorant as\r\n     themselves, I certainly did feel that another work on America\r\n     was yet wanted, and at once determined to undertake a task\r\n     which inferior considerations would probably have induced me\r\n     to decline.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau, ardent advocate of political reform at home, found in\r\nthe United States proofs for her faith in democracy[16]. Captain Marryat\r\nbelittled Miss Martineau, but in his six volumes proved himself less a\r\ncritic of America than an enemy of democracy. Answering a review of his\r\nearlier volumes, published separately, he wrote in his concluding\r\nvolume: \"I candidly acknowledge that the reviewer is right in his\r\nsupposition; my great object has been to do serious injury to the cause\r\nof democracy[17].\"\r\n\r\nThe fact was that British governing and intellectual classes were\r\nsuffering a recoil from the enthusiasms leading up to the step toward\r\ndemocracy in the Reform of 1832. The electoral franchise was still\r\nlimited to a small minority of the population. Britain was still ruled\r\nby her \"wise men\" of wealth and position. Meanwhile, however, just at\r\nthe moment when dominant Whig influence in England carried through that\r\nstep forward toward democratic institutions which Whigs had long lauded\r\nin America, the latter country had progressed to manhood suffrage, or as\r\nnearly all leading Englishmen, whether Whig or Tory, regarded it, had\r\nplunged into the rule of the mob. The result was a rapid lessening in\r\nWhig ruling-class expression of admiration for America, even before long\r\nto the complete cessation of such admiration, and to assertions in Great\r\nBritain that the Reform of 1832 was \"final,\" the last step toward\r\ndemocracy which Britain could safely take. It is not strange that the\r\nbooks and reviews of the period from 1830 to 1840, heavily stress the\r\ndangers and crudity of American democracy. They were written for what\r\nwas now a nearly unanimous British reading public, fearful lest Radical\r\npressure for still further electoral reform should preach the example of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThus after 1832 the previous sympathy for America of one section of the\r\nBritish governing class disappears. More--it is replaced by a critical,\r\nif not openly hostile attitude. Soon, with the rapid development of the\r\npower and wealth of the United States, governing-class England, of all\r\nfactions save the Radical, came to view America just as it would have\r\nviewed any other rising nation, that is, as a problem to be studied for\r\nits influence on British prosperity and power. Again, expressions in\r\nprint reflect the changes of British view--nowhere more clearly than in\r\ntravellers' books. After 1840, for nearly a decade, these are devoted,\r\nnot to American political institutions, but to studies, many of them\r\nvery careful ones, of American industry and governmental policy.\r\n\r\nBuckingham, one-time member of Parliament, wrote nine volumes of such\r\ndescription. His work is a storehouse of fact, useful to this day to the\r\nAmerican historical student[18]. George Combe, philosopher and\r\nphrenologist, studied especially social institutions[19]. Joseph Sturge,\r\nphilanthropist and abolitionist, made a tour, under the guidance of the\r\npoet Whittier, through the Northern and Eastern States[20].\r\nFeatherstonaugh, a scientist and civil engineer, described the Southern\r\nslave states, in terms completely at variance with those of Sturge[21].\r\nKennedy, traveller in Texas, and later British consul at Galveston, and\r\nWarburton, a traveller who came to the United States by way of Canada,\r\nan unusual approach, were both frankly startled, the latter professedly\r\nalarmed, at the evidences of power in America[22]. Amazed at the energy,\r\ngrowth and prosperity of the country and alarmed at the anti-British\r\nfeeling he found in New York City, Warburton wrote that \"they\r\n[Americans] only wait for matured power to apply the incendiary torch of\r\nRepublicanism to the nations of Europe[23].\" Soon after this was written\r\nthere began, in 1848, that great tide of Irish emigration to America\r\nwhich heavily reinforced the anti-British attitude of the City of New\r\nYork, and largely changed its character.\r\n\r\nDid books dilating upon the expanding power of America reflect British\r\npublic opinion, or did they create it? It is difficult to estimate such\r\nmatters. Certainly it is not uninteresting that these books coincided in\r\npoint of time with a British governmental attitude of opposition, though\r\non peaceful lines, to the development of American power, and to the\r\nadoption to the point of faith, by British commercial classes, of free\r\ntrade as opposed to the American protective system. But governing\r\nclasses were not the British public, and to the great unenfranchised\r\nmass, finding voice through the writings of a few leaders, the\r\nprosperity of America made a powerful appeal. Radical democracy was\r\nagain beginning to make its plea in Britain. In 1849 there was published\r\na study of the United States, more careful and exact than any previous\r\nto Bryce's great work, and lauding American political institutions. This\r\nwas Mackay's \"Western World,\" and that there was a public eager for such\r\nestimate is evidenced by the fact that the book went through four\r\nBritish editions in 1850[24]. At the end of the decade, then, there\r\nappeared once more a vigorous champion of the cause of British\r\ndemocracy, comparing the results of \"government by the wise\" with\r\nalleged mob rule. Mackay wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Society in America started from the point to which society\r\n     in Europe is only yet finding. The equality of men is, to\r\n     this moment, its corner-stone ... that which develops itself\r\n     as the sympathy of class, becomes in America the general\r\n     sentiment of society.... We present an imposing front to the\r\n     world; but let us tear the picture and look at the canvas.\r\n     One out of every seven of us is a pauper. Every six\r\n     Englishmen have, in addition to their other enormous burdens,\r\n     to support a seventh between them, whose life is spent in\r\n     consuming, but in adding nothing to the source of their\r\n     common subsistence.\"\r\n\r\nBritish governing classes then, forgoing after 1850 opposition to the\r\nadvance of American power, found themselves involved again, as before\r\n1832, in the problem of the possible influence of a prosperous American\r\ndemocracy upon an unenfranchised public opinion at home. Also, for all\r\nEnglishmen, of whatever class, in spite of rivalry in power, of opposing\r\ntheories of trade, of divergent political institutions, there existed a\r\nvague, though influential, pride in the advance of a people of similar\r\nrace, sprung from British loins[25]. And there remained for all\r\nEnglishmen also one puzzling and discreditable American institution,\r\nslavery--held up to scorn by the critics of the United States, difficult\r\nof excuse among her friends.\r\n\r\nAgitation conducted by the great philanthropist, Wilberforce, had early\r\ncommitted British Government and people to a crusade against the African\r\nslave trade. This British policy was clearly announced to the world in\r\nthe negotiations at Vienna in 1814-15. But Britain herself still\r\nsupported the institution of slavery in her West Indian colonies and it\r\nwas not until British humanitarian sentiment had forced emancipation\r\nupon the unwilling sugar planters, in 1833, that the nation was morally\r\nfree to criticize American domestic slavery. Meanwhile great\r\nemancipation societies, with many branches, all virile and active, had\r\ngrown up in England and in Scotland. These now turned to an attack on\r\nslavery the world over, and especially on American slavery. The great\r\nAmerican abolitionist, Garrison, found more support in England than in\r\nhis own country; his weekly paper, _The Liberator_, is full of messages\r\nof cheer from British friends and societies, and of quotations from a\r\nsympathetic, though generally provincial, British press.\r\n\r\nFrom 1830 to 1850 British anti-slavery sentiment was at its height. It\r\nwatched with anxiety the evidence of a developing struggle over slavery\r\nin the United States, hopeful, as each crisis arose, that the free\r\nNorthern States would impose their will upon the Southern Slave States.\r\nBut as each crisis turned to compromise, seemingly enhancing the power\r\nof the South, and committing America to a retention of slavery, the\r\nhopes of British abolitionists waned. The North did indeed, to British\r\nopinion, become identified with opposition to the expansion of slavery,\r\nbut after the \"great compromise of 1850,\" where the elder American\r\nstatesmen of both North and South proclaimed the \"finality\" of that\r\nmeasure, British sympathy for the North rapidly lessened. Moreover,\r\nafter 1850, there was in Britain itself a decay of general humanitarian\r\nsentiment as regards slavery. The crusade had begun to seem hopeless and\r\nthe earlier vigorous agitators were dead. The British Government still\r\nmaintained its naval squadron for the suppression of the African slave\r\ntrade, but the British official mind no longer keenly interested itself\r\neither in this effort or in the general question of slavery.\r\n\r\nNevertheless American slavery and slave conditions were still, after\r\n1850, favourite matters for discussion, almost universally critical, by\r\nEnglish writers. Each renewal of the conflict in America, even though\r\nlocal, not national in character, drew out a flood of comment. In the\r\npublic press this blot upon American civilization was a steady subject\r\nfor attack, and that attack was naturally directed against the South.\r\nThe London _Times_, in particular, lost no opportunity of presenting the\r\nmatter to its readers. In 1856, a Mr. Thomas Gladstone visited Kansas\r\nduring the height of the border struggles there, and reported his\r\nobservations in letters to the _Times_. The writer was wholly on the\r\nside of the Northern settlers in Kansas, though not hopeful that the\r\nKansas struggle would expand to a national conflict. He constantly\r\ndepicted the superior civilization, industry, and social excellence of\r\nthe North as compared with the South[26].\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ excited greater interest in England\r\nthan in America itself. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852,\r\nand by the end of the year over one million copies had been sold, as\r\nopposed to one hundred and fifty thousand in the United States. But if\r\none distinguished writer is to be believed, this great British interest\r\nin the book was due more to English antipathy to America than to\r\nantipathy to slavery[27]. This writer was Nassau W. Senior, who, in\r\n1857, published a reprint of his article on \"American Slavery\" in the\r\n206th number of the _Edinburgh Review_, reintroducing in his book\r\nextreme language denunciatory of slavery that had been cut out by the\r\neditor of the _Review_[28]. Senior had been stirred to write by the\r\nbrutal attack upon Charles Sumner in the United States Senate after his\r\nspeech of May 19-20, 1856, evidence, again, that each incident of the\r\nslavery quarrel in America excited British attention.\r\n\r\nSenior, like Thomas Gladstone, painted the North as all anti-slavery,\r\nthe South as all pro-slavery. Similar impressions of British\r\nunderstanding (or misunderstanding) are received from the citations of\r\nthe British provincial press, so favoured by Garrison in his\r\n_Liberator_[29]. Yet for intellectual Britain, at least--that Britain\r\nwhich was vocal and whose opinion can be ascertained in spite of this\r\nconstant interest in American slavery, there was generally a fixed\r\nbelief that slavery in the United States was so firmly established that\r\nit could not be overthrown. Of what use, then, the further expenditure\r\nof British sympathy or effort in a lost cause? Senior himself, at the\r\nconclusion of his fierce attack on the Southern States, expressed the\r\npessimism of British abolitionists. He wrote, \"We do not venture to hope\r\nthat we, or our sons, or our grandsons, will see American slavery\r\nextirpated, or even materially mitigated[30].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: State Department, Eng., Vol. LXXIX, No. 135, March 27,\r\n1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Walpole, _Russell_, Vol. II, p. 367.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Life of Lady John Russell_, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: There was a revival of this fear at the end of the American\r\nCivil War.

This generalization, as applied to what were, after\r\nall, minor controversies, is in great measure true. In larger questions\r\nof policy, as regards spheres of influence or developing power, or\r\nprinciples of trade, there was difference, but no longer any essential\r\nopposition or declared rivalry[31]. In theories of government there was\r\nsharp divergence, clearly appreciated, however, only in governing-class\r\nBritain. This sense of divergence, even of a certain threat from America\r\nto British political institutions, united with an established opinion\r\nthat slavery was permanently fixed in the United States to reinforce\r\ngovernmental indifference, sometimes even hostility, to America. The\r\nBritish public, also, was largely hopeless of any change in the\r\ninstitution of slavery, and its own active humanitarian interest was\r\nwaning, though still dormant--not dead. Yet the two nations, to a degree\r\nnot true of any other two world-powers, were of the same race, had\r\nsimilar basic laws, read the same books, and were held in close touch at\r\nmany points by the steady flow of British emigration to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the election of Lincoln to the Presidency, in November,\r\n1860, the storm-clouds of civil strife rapidly gathered, the situation\r\ntook both British Government and people by surprise. There was not any\r\nclear understanding either of American political conditions, or of the\r\nintensity of feeling now aroused over the question of the extension of\r\nslave territory. The most recent descriptions of America had agreed in\r\nassertion that at some future time there would take place, in all\r\nprobability, a dissolution of the Union, on lines of diverging economic\r\ninterests, but also stated that there was nothing in the American\r\nsituation to indicate immediate progress in this direction. Grattan, a\r\nlong-time resident in America as British Consul at Boston, wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The day must no doubt come when clashing objects will break\r\n     the ties of common interest which now preserve the Union. But\r\n     no man may foretell the period of dissolution.... The many\r\n     restraining causes are out of sight of foreign observation.\r\n     The Lilliputian threads binding the man mountain are\r\n     invisible; and it seems wondrous that each limb does not act\r\n     for itself independently of its fellows. A closer examination\r\n     shows the nature of the network which keeps the members of\r\n     this association so tightly bound. Any attempt to untangle\r\n     the ties, more firmly fastens them. When any one State talks\r\n     of separation, the others become spontaneously knotted\r\n     together. When a section blusters about its particular\r\n     rights, the rest feel each of theirs to be common to all. If\r\n     a foreign nation hint at hostility, the whole Union becomes\r\n     in reality united. And thus in every contingency from which\r\n     there can be danger, there is also found the element of\r\n     safety.\" Yet, he added, \"All attempts to strengthen this\r\n     federal government at the expense of the States' governments\r\n     must be futile.... The federal government exists on\r\n     sufferance only. Any State may at any time constitutionally\r\n     withdraw from the Union, and thus virtually dissolve it[32].\"\r\n\r\nEven more emphatically, though with less authority, wrote one Charles\r\nMackay, styled by the American press as a \"distinguished British poet,\"\r\nwho made the usual rapid tour of the principal cities of America in\r\n1857-58, and as rapidly penned his impressions:\r\n\r\n     \"Many persons in the United States talk of a dissolution of\r\n     the Union, but few believe in it.... All this is mere bravado\r\n     and empty talk. It means nothing. The Union is dear to all\r\n     Americans, whatever they may say to the contrary.... There is\r\n     no present danger to the Union, and the violent expressions\r\n     to which over-ardent politicians of the North and South\r\n     sometimes give vent have no real meaning. The 'Great West,'\r\n     as it is fondly called, is in the position even now to\r\n     arbitrate between North and South, should the quarrel stretch\r\n     beyond words, or should anti-slavery or any other question\r\n     succeed in throwing any difference between them which it\r\n     would take revolvers and rifles rather than speeches and\r\n     votes to put an end to[33].\"\r\n\r\nThe slavery controversy in America had, in short, come to be regarded in\r\nEngland as a constant quarrel between North and South, but of no\r\nimmediate danger to the Union. Each outbreak of violent American\r\ncontroversy produced a British comment sympathetic with the North. The\r\nturmoil preceding and following the election of Lincoln in 1860, on the\r\nplatform of \"no extension of slavery,\" was very generally noted by the\r\nBritish press and public, as a sign favourable to the cause of\r\nanti-slavery, but with no understanding that Southern threat would at\r\nlast be realized in definite action. Herbert Spencer, in a letter of May\r\n15, 1862, to his American friend, Yeomans, wrote, \"As far as I had the\r\nmeans of judging, the feeling here was at first _very decidedly_ on the\r\nside of the North[34] ...\" The British metropolitan press, in nearly\r\nevery issue of which for at least two years after December, 1860, there\r\nappeared news items and editorial comment on the American crisis, was at\r\nfirst nearly unanimous in condemning the South[35]. The _Times_, with\r\naccustomed vigour, led the field. On November 21, 1860, it stated:\r\n\r\n     \"When we read the speech of Mr. Lincoln on the subject of\r\n     Slavery and consider the extreme moderation of the sentiments\r\n     it expresses, the allowance that is made for the situation,\r\n     for the feelings, for the prejudices, of the South; when we\r\n     see how entirely he narrows his opposition to the single\r\n     point of the admission of Slavery into the Territories, we\r\n     cannot help being forcibly struck by the absurdity of\r\n     breaking up a vast and glorious confederacy like that of the\r\n     United States from the dread and anger inspired by the\r\n     election of such a man to the office of Chief Magistrate....\r\n     We rejoice, on higher and surer grounds, that it [the\r\n     election] has ended in the return of Mr. Lincoln. We are glad\r\n     to think that the march of Slavery, and the domineering tone\r\n     which its advocates were beginning to assume over Freedom,\r\n     has been at length arrested and silenced. We rejoice that a\r\n     vast community of our own race has at length given an\r\n     authoritative expression to sentiments which are entertained\r\n     by everyone in this country. We trust to see the American\r\n     Government employed in tasks more worthy of a State founded\r\n     on the doctrines of liberty and equality than the invention\r\n     of shifts and devices to perpetuate servitude; and we hear in\r\n     this great protest of American freedom the tardy echo of\r\n     those humane doctrines to which England has so long become a\r\n     convert.\"\r\n\r\nOther leading journals, though with less of patronizing\r\nself-complacency, struck the same note as the _Times_. The _Economist_\r\nattributed Lincoln's election to a shift in the sympathies of the \"lower\r\norders\" in the electorate who had now deserted their former leaders, the\r\nslave-owning aristocracy of the South, and allied themselves with the\r\nrefined and wise leaders of the North. Lincoln, it argued, was not an\r\nextremist in any sense. His plan of action lay within the limits of\r\nstatesmanlike moderation[36]. The _Saturday Review_ was less sure that\r\nEngland should rejoice with the North. British self-esteem had suffered\r\nsome hard blows at the hands of the Democratic party in America, but at\r\nleast England knew where Democrats stood, and could count on no more\r\ndiscourtesy or injustice than that inflicted in the past. The Republican\r\nparty, however, had no policy, except that of its leader, Seward, and\r\nfrom him might be expected extreme insolence[37]. This was a very early\r\njudgment of Seward, and one upon which the _Saturday Review_ preened\r\nitself later, as wholly justified. The _Spectator_, the only one of the\r\nfour journals thus far considered which ultimately remained constant in\r\nadvocacy of the Northern cause, was at first lukewarm in comment,\r\nregarding the 1860 election, while fought on the slavery issue, as in\r\nreality a mere contest between parties for political power[38].\r\n\r\nSuch was the initial attitude of the English press. Each press issue\r\nfor several weeks harped on the same chord, though sounding varying\r\nnotes. If the South really means forcible resistance, said the _Times_,\r\nit is doomed to quick suppression. \"A few hundred thousand slave-owners,\r\ntrembling nightly with visions of murder and pillage, backed by a\r\ndissolute population of 'poor whites,' are no match for the hardy and\r\nresolute populations of the Free States[39],\" and if the South hoped for\r\nforeign aid it should be undeceived promptly: \"Can any sane man believe\r\nthat England and France will consent, as is now suggested, to stultify\r\nthe policy of half a century for the sake of an extended cotton trade,\r\nand to purchase the favours of Charleston and Milledgeville by\r\nrecognizing what has been called 'the isothermal law, which impels\r\nAfrican labour toward the tropics' on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic[40]?\" Moreover all Americans ought to understand clearly that\r\nBritish respect for the United States \"was not due to the attitude of\r\nthe South with its ruffian demonstrations in Congress.... All that is\r\nnoble and venerable in the United States is associated with its Federal\r\nConstitution[41].\"\r\n\r\nDid the British public hold these same opinions? There is no direct\r\nevidence available in sufficient quantity in autobiography or letters\r\nupon which to base a conclusion. Such works are silent on the struggle\r\nin America for the first few months and presumably public opinion, less\r\ninformed even than the press, received its impressions from the journals\r\ncustomarily read. Both at this period and all through the war, also, it\r\nshould be remembered, clearly, that most newspapers, all the reviews, in\r\nfact nearly all vehicles of British expression, were in the early\r\n'sixties \"in the hands of the educated classes, and these educated\r\nclasses corresponded closely with the privileged classes.\" The more\r\ndemocratic element of British Society lacked any adequate press\r\nrepresentation of its opinions. \"This body could express itself by such\r\ncomparatively crude methods as public meetings and demonstrations, but\r\nit was hampered in literary and political expression[42].\" The opinion\r\nof the press was then, presumably, the opinion of the majority of the\r\neducated British public.\r\n\r\nThus British comment on America took the form, at first of\r\nmoralizations, now severe toward the South, now indifferent, yet very\r\ngenerally asserting the essential justice of the Northern position. But\r\nit was early evident that the newspapers, one and all, were quite\r\nunprepared for the determined front soon put up by South Carolina and\r\nother Southern States. Surprised by the violence of Southern\r\ndeclarations, the only explanation found by the British press was that\r\npolitical control had been seized by the uneducated and lawless element.\r\nThe _Times_ characterized this element of the South as in a state of\r\ndeplorable ignorance comparable with that of the Irish peasantry, a\r\n\"poor, proud, lazy, excitable and violent class, ever ready with knife\r\nand revolver[43].\" The fate of the Union, according to the _Saturday\r\nReview_, was in the hands of the \"most ignorant, most unscrupulous, and\r\nmost lawless [class] in the world--the poor or mean whites of the Slave\r\nStates[44].\" Like judgments were expressed by the _Economist_ and, more\r\nmildly, by the _Spectator_[45]. Subsequently some of these journals\r\nfound difficulty in this connection, in swinging round the circle to\r\nexpressions of admiration for the wise and powerful aristocracy of the\r\nSouth; but all, especially the _Times_, were skilled by long practice\r\nin the journalistic art of facing about while claiming perfect\r\nconsistency. In denial of a Southern right of secession, also, they were\r\nnearly a unit[46], though the _Saturday Review_ argued the case for the\r\nSouth, making a pointed parallel between the present situation and that\r\nof the American Colonies in seceding from England[47].\r\n\r\nThe quotations thus far made exhibit for the leading papers an initial\r\nconfusion and ignorance difficult to harmonize with the theory of an\r\n\"enlightened press.\" The Reviews, by the conditions of publication, came\r\ninto action more slowly and during 1860 there appeared but one article,\r\nin the _Edinburgh Review_, giving any adequate idea of what was really\r\ntaking place in America[48]. The lesser British papers generally\r\nfollowed the tone of the leading journals, but without either great\r\ninterest or much acumen. In truth the depth of British newspaper\r\nignorance, considering their positiveness of utterance, appears utterly\r\nastonishing if regarded from the view-point of modern historical\r\nknowledge. But is this, after all, a matter for surprise? Was there not\r\nequal confusion at least, possibly equal ignorance, in America itself,\r\ncertainly among the press and people of the Northern States? They also\r\nhad come by experience to discount Southern threats, and were slow to\r\nunderstand that the great conflict of ideals and interests was at\r\nlast begun.\r\n\r\nThe British press both influenced and reflected educated class opinion,\r\nand, in some degree, official opinion as well. Lord John Russell at the\r\nForeign Office and Lord Lyons, British Minister at Washington, were\r\nexchanging anxious letters, and the latter was sending home reports\r\nremarkable for their clear analysis of the American controversy. Yet\r\neven he was slow to appreciate the inevitability of secession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LYONS (_From a photograph taken at Boston, U.S.A.,\r\nin 1860) (From Lord Newton's \"Life of Lord Lyons,\" by kind permission_)]\r\n\r\nOther officials, especially those in minor positions in the United\r\nStates, showed a lack of grasp of the situation similar to that of the\r\npress. An amusing illustration of this, furnishing a far-fetched view of\r\ncauses, is supplied in a letter of February 2, 1860, from Consul Bunch,\r\nat Charleston, S.C., to Lord Lyons, the British Minister at\r\nWashington[49]. Bunch wrote describing a dinner which had been given the\r\nevening before, by the Jockey Club of Charleston. Being called upon for\r\na speech, he had alluded to the prizes of the Turf at home, and had\r\nreferred especially to the Plates run for the various British colonies.\r\nContinuing, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"'... I cannot help calling your attention to the great loss\r\n     you yourselves have suffered by ceasing to be a Colonial\r\n     Dependency of Great Britain, as I am sure that if you had\r\n     continued to be so, the Queen would have had great pleasure\r\n     in sending you some Plates too.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of course this was meant for the broadest sort of joke,\r\n     calculated to raise a laugh after dinner, but to my\r\n     amazement, the company chose to take me literally, and\r\n     applauded for about ten minutes--in fact I could not go on\r\n     for some time.\"\r\n\r\nBunch evidently hardly knew what to make of this demonstration. He could\r\nwith difficulty believe that South Carolina wished to be re-annexed as a\r\ncolony of Great Britain, and comments upon the episode in a somewhat\r\nhumorous vein. Nevertheless in concluding his letter, he solemnly\r\nassures Lord Lyons that\r\n\r\n     \"... The Jockey Club is composed of the 'best people' of\r\n     South Carolina--rich planters and the like. It represents,\r\n     therefore, the 'gentlemanly interest' and not a bit of\r\n     universal suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to assume that either in South Carolina or in England\r\nthere was, in February, 1860, any serious thought of a resumption of\r\ncolonial relations, though W.H. Russell, correspondent of the _Times_,\r\nreported in the spring, 1861, that he frequently heard the same\r\nsentiment in the South[50]. For general official England, as for the\r\npress, the truth is that up to the time of the secession of South\r\nCarolina no one really believed that a final rupture was about to take\r\nplace between North and South. When, on December 20, 1860, that State in\r\nsolemn convention declared the dissolution \"of the Union now existing\r\nbetween South Carolina and the other States, under the name of the\r\n'United States of America,'\" and when it was understood that other\r\nSouthern States would soon follow this example, British opinion believed\r\nand hoped that the rupture would be accomplished peaceably. Until it\r\nbecame clear that war would ensue, the South was still damned by the\r\npress as seeking the preservation of an evil institution. Slavery was\r\neven more vigorously asserted as the ignoble and sole cause. In the\r\nnumber for April, 1861, the _Edinburgh Review_ attributed the whole\r\ndifficulty to slavery, asserted that British sympathy would be with the\r\nanti-slavery party, yet advanced the theory that the very dissolution of\r\nthe Union would hasten the ultimate extinction of slavery since economic\r\ncompetition with a neighbouring free state, the North, would compel the\r\nSouth itself to abandon its beloved \"domestic institution[51].\"\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the news from South Carolina, the _Times_, in a long and\r\ncarefully worded editorial, took up one by one the alleged causes of\r\nsecession, dismissed them as inadequate, and concluded, \"... we cannot\r\ndisguise from ourselves that, apart from all political complications,\r\nthere is a right and a wrong in this question, and that the right\r\nbelongs, with all its advantages, to the States of the North[52].\" Three\r\ndays later it asserted, \"The North is for freedom of discussion, the\r\nSouth represses freedom of discussion with the tar-brush and the\r\npine-fagot.\" And again, on January 10, \"The Southern States expected\r\nsympathy for their undertaking from the public opinion of this country.\r\nThe tone of the press has already done much to undeceive them....\"\r\n\r\nIn general both the metropolitan and the provincial press expressed\r\nsimilar sentiments, though there were exceptions. The _Dublin News_\r\npublished with approval a long communication addressed to Irishmen at\r\nhome and abroad: \"... there is no power on earth or in heaven which can\r\nkeep in peace this unholy co-partnership.... I hope ... that the North\r\nwill quietly permit the South to retire from the confederacy and bear\r\nalone the odium of all mankind[53]....\" The _Saturday Review_ thought\r\nthat deeper than declared differences lay the ruling social structure of\r\nthe South which now visioned a re-opening of the African Slave Trade,\r\nand the occupation by slavery of the whole southern portion of North\r\nAmerica. \"A more ignoble basis for a great Confederacy it is impossible\r\nto conceive, nor one in the long run more precarious.... Assuredly it\r\nwill be the Northern Confederacy, based on principles of freedom, with a\r\npolicy untainted by crime, with a free working-class of white men, that\r\nwill be the one to go on and prosper and become the leader of the New\r\nWorld[54].\" The _London Chronicle_ was vigorous in denunciation. \"No\r\ncountry on the globe produces a blackguardism, a cowardice or a\r\ntreachery, so consummate as that of the negro-driving States of the new\r\nSouthern Confederacy\"--a bit of editorial blackguardism in itself[55].\r\nThe _London Review_ more moderately stigmatized slavery as the cause,\r\nbut was lukewarm in praise of Northern idealisms, regarding the whole\r\nmatter as one of diverging economic systems and in any case as\r\ninevitably resulting in dissolution of the Union at some time. The\r\ninevitable might as well come now as later and would result in benefit\r\nto both sections as well as to the world fearing the monstrous empire of\r\npower that had grown up in America[56].\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of early expressions by the British press was, in truth,\r\ndefinitely antagonistic to the South, and this was particularly true of\r\nthe provincial press. Garrison's _Liberator_, advocating extreme\r\nabolition action, had long made a practice of presenting excerpts from\r\nBritish newspapers, speeches and sermons in support of its cause. In\r\n1860 there were thirty-nine such citations; in the first months of 1861\r\nmany more, all condemning slavery and the South. For the most part these\r\ncitations represented a comparatively unknown and uninfluential section,\r\nboth in politics and literature, of the British people. Matthew Arnold\r\nwas among the first of men of letters to record his faith that secession\r\nwas final and, as he hoped, an excellent thing for the North, looking to\r\nthe purity of race and the opportunity for unhampered advance[57]. If\r\nEnglish writers were in any way influenced by their correspondents in\r\nthe United States they may, indeed, have well been in doubt as to the\r\norigin and prospects of the American quarrel. Hawthorne, but recently at\r\nhome again after seven years' consulship in England, was writing that\r\nabolition was not a Northern object in the war just begun. Whittier\r\nwrote to _his_ English friends that slavery, and slavery alone, was the\r\nbasic issue[58]. But literary Britain was slow to express itself save in\r\nthe Reviews. These, representing varying shades of British upper-class\r\nopinion and presenting articles presumably more profound than the\r\nnewspaper editorials, frequently offered more recondite origins of the\r\nAmerican crisis. The _Quarterly Review_, organ of extreme Conservatism,\r\nin its first article, dwelt upon the failure of democratic institutions,\r\na topic not here treated at length since it will be dealt with in a\r\nseparate chapter as deserving special study. The _Quarterly_ is also the\r\nfirst to advance the argument that the protective tariff, advocated by\r\nthe North, was a real cause for Southern secession[59]; an idea made\r\nmuch of later, by the elements unfriendly to the North, but not\r\nhitherto advanced. In these first issues of the Reviews for 1861, there\r\nwas frequently put forth the \"Southern gentlemen\" theory.\r\n\r\n     \"At a distance of three thousand miles, the Southern planters\r\n     did, indeed, bear a resemblance to the English country\r\n     gentleman which led to a feeling of kinship and sympathy with\r\n     him on the part of those in England who represented the old\r\n     traditions of landed gentility. This 'Southern gentleman'\r\n     theory, containing as it did an undeniable element of truth,\r\n     is much harped upon by certain of the reviewers, and one can\r\n     easily conceive of its popularity in the London Clubs.... The\r\n     'American,' so familiar to British readers, during the first\r\n     half of the century, through the eyes of such travellers as\r\n     Mrs. Trollope, now becomes the 'Yankee,' and is located north\r\n     of Mason and Dixon's line[60].\"\r\n\r\nSuch portrayal was not characteristic of all Reviews, rather of the Tory\r\norgans alone, and the Radical _Westminster_ took pains to deny the truth\r\nof the picture, asserting again and again that the vital and sole cause\r\nof the conflict was slavery. Previous articles are summed up in that of\r\nOctober, 1863, as a profession of the _Westminster's_ opinion\r\nthroughout: \"... the South are fighting for liberty to found a Slave\r\nPower. Should it prove successful, truer devil's work, if we may use the\r\nmetaphor, will rarely have been done[61].\"\r\n\r\nFortunate would it have been for the Northern cause, if British opinion\r\ngenerally sympathetic at first on anti-slavery grounds, had not soon\r\nfound cause to doubt the just basis of its sympathy, from the trend of\r\nevents in America. Lincoln had been elected on a platform opposing the\r\nfurther territorial expansion of slavery. On that point the North was\r\nfairly well united. But the great majority of those who voted for\r\nLincoln would have indignantly repudiated any purpose to take active\r\nsteps toward the extinction of slavery where it already existed. Lincoln\r\nunderstood this perfectly, and whatever his opinion about the ultimate\r\nfate of slavery if prohibited expansion, he from the first took the\r\nground that the terms of his election constituted a mandate limiting his\r\naction. As secession developed he rightly centred his thought and effort\r\non the preservation of the Union, a duty imposed by his election to the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nNaturally, as the crisis developed, there were many efforts at still\r\nanother great compromise. Among the friends of the outgoing President,\r\nBuchanan, whose term of office would not expire until March 4, 1861,\r\nthere were still some Southern leaders, like Jefferson Davis, seeking\r\neither a complete surrender to Southern will, or advantages for Southern\r\nsecurity in case secession was accomplished. Buchanan appealed\r\nhysterically to the old-time love of the Union and to the spirit of\r\ncompromise. Great congressional committees of both Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives were formed seeking a solution. Crittenden for the\r\nborder states between North and South, where, more than anywhere else,\r\nthere was division of opinion, proposed pledges to be given to the\r\nSouth. Seward, long-time champion of the anti-slavery North, was active\r\nin the Senate in suggestion and intrigue seemingly intended to\r\nconciliate by concessions. Charles Francis Adams, early a Free Soiler,\r\nin the House of Representatives Committee conducted his Republican\r\ncolleagues along a path apparently leading to a guarantee of slavery as\r\nthen established[62]. A constitutional amendment was drafted to this\r\neffect and received Lincoln's preliminary approval. Finally Lincoln, in\r\nhis inaugural address, March 4, 1861, declared:\r\n\r\n     \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with\r\n     the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I\r\n     believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no\r\n     inclination to do so.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be no matter for surprise, therefore, that, as these efforts\r\nwere observed in Great Britain, a note of uncertainty began to replace\r\nthe earlier unanimity of opinion that the future of slavery was at stake\r\nin America. This offered an easy excuse for a switch-about of sympathy\r\nas British commercial and other interests began to be developed, and\r\neven dismayed the ardent friends of the anti-slavery North. Meanwhile\r\nthe Government of Great Britain, from the very first appearance of the\r\ncloud of civil war, had focused its attention on the point of what the\r\nevents in America portended to British interests and policy. This is the\r\nbusiness of governments, and their agents would be condemned as\r\ninefficient did they neglect it. But did British governmental policy go\r\nbeyond this entirely justifiable first thought for immediate British\r\ninterests to the point of positive hope that England would find an\r\nadvantage in the breaking up of the great American Republic? American\r\nopinion, both then and later, believed Great Britain guilty of this\r\noffence, but such criticism was tinged with the passions of the Civil\r\nWar. Yet a more impartial critic, though possibly an unfriendly one\r\nbecause of his official position, made emphatic declaration to like\r\neffect. On January 1, 1861, Baron de Brunow, Russian Ambassador at\r\nLondon, reported to St. Petersburg that, \"the English Government, at the\r\nbottom of its heart, desires the separation of North America into two\r\nrepublics, which will watch each other jealously and counterbalance one\r\nthe other. Then England, on terms of peace and commerce with both,\r\nwould have nothing to fear from either; for she would dominate them,\r\nrestraining them by their rival ambitions[63].\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, one turns from the surmises of foreign diplomats as to the\r\nsprings of British policy, to the more authentic evidence of official\r\nand private diplomatic correspondence, there is found no proof for such\r\naccusations. Certainty neither Lord John Russell, Foreign Secretary, nor\r\nLord Lyons, British Minister at Washington, reveal any animus against\r\nthe United States. Considering his many personal ties with leaders of\r\nboth factions Lyons, from the first, reported events with wonderful\r\nimpartiality, and great clarity. On November 12, 1860, he sent to\r\nRussell a full description of the clamour raised in the South over the\r\nelection of Lincoln, enumerated the resignation of Federal officials\r\n(calling these \"ill-judged measures\"), and expressed the opinion that\r\nLincoln was no Radical. He hoped the storm would blow over without\r\ndamage to the Union[64]. Russell, for his part, was prompt to instruct\r\nLyons and the British consuls not \"to seem to favour one party rather\r\nthan the other,\" and not to express opinions or to give advice, unless\r\nasked for by the State Governments, in which case the advice should be\r\nagainst all violent action as tending toward civil war[65].\r\n\r\nThis bare statement may indeed be interpreted as indicating an eager\r\nreadiness on Russell's part to accept as final the dissolution of the\r\nUnion, but such an interpretation is not borne out by a reading of his\r\ninstructions. Rather he was perplexed, and anxious that British agents\r\nshould not gain the ill-will of either American faction, an ill-will\r\nthat would be alike detrimental in the future, whether the Union\r\nremained unbroken or was destroyed.\r\n\r\nStrict instructions against offering advice are therefore repeated\r\nfrequently[66]. Meanwhile the first concrete problem requiring British\r\naction came from the seizure by South Carolina of the Federal customs\r\nhouse at the port of Charleston, and the attempt of the State\r\nauthorities to collect port dues customarily paid to Federal officials.\r\nBritish shipowners appealed to Consul Bunch for instructions, he to\r\nLyons, and the latter to the American Secretary of State, Judge Black.\r\nThis was on December 31, 1860, while Buchanan was still President, and\r\nBlack's answer was evasive, though asserting that the United States must\r\ntechnically regard the events in South Carolina as acts of violent\r\nrebellion[67]. Black refused to state what action would be taken if\r\nBunch advised British shipowners to pay, but a way out of the\r\nembarrassment was found by advising such payment to State authorities\r\n\"under protest\" as done \"under compulsion.\" To one of his letters to\r\nBunch on this topic, Lyons appended an expression indicative of his own\r\nearly attitude. \"The domestic slavery of the South is a bitter pill\r\nwhich it will be hard enough to get the English to swallow. But if the\r\nSlave Trade is to be added to the dose, the least squeamish British\r\nstomach will reject it[68].\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless the vigorous action of South Carolina, soon followed by\r\nother Southern States, made a deep impression on Russell, especially\r\nwhen compared with the uncertainty and irresolution manifested in the\r\nattempted compromise measures of Northern statesmen. In a private letter\r\nto Lyons, January 10, 1861, he wrote \"I do not see how the United States\r\ncan be cobbled together again by any compromise.... I cannot see any\r\nmode of reconciling such parties as these. The best thing _now_ would\r\nbe that the right to secede should be acknowledged.... I hope sensible\r\nmen will take this view.... But above all I hope no force will be\r\nused[69].\" And again twelve days later, \"I suppose the break-up of the\r\nUnion is now inevitable[70].\" To Russell, as to most foreign observers,\r\nit seemed that if the South with its great wealth, its enormous extent\r\nof territory, and its five and one-half millions of population, were\r\ndetermined to leave the Union, no force whatever could compel a return.\r\nHistory failed to record any revolution on so large a scale which had\r\nnot succeeded. His desire, therefore, was that the North would yield to\r\nthe inevitable, and would not plunge into a useless civil war disastrous\r\nalike to the prosperity of America and of foreign nations. Russell's\r\nfirst hope was that the South would forgo secession; his second, this\r\naccomplished, that there would be no war, and in this sense he\r\ninstructed Lyons. The latter, less expectant of peaceful separation, and\r\nmore aware of the latent power of the North, maintained throughout his\r\nentire service at Washington that there was at least a _chance_ that the\r\nNorth could subdue the South by might of arms[71], but he also, looking\r\nto British interests, saw his early duty, before war broke, in cautious\r\nsuggestions against forcible Northern action. Thus from January to\r\nMarch, 1861, British effort and indirect advice were based on the hope\r\nthat British trade interests might escape the tribulations inevitable\r\nfrom a civil conflict in America. Beyond that point there was no grasp\r\nof the complications likely to arise in case of war, and no clear\r\nformulation of British policy[72].\r\n\r\nIn fact up to the middle of March, 1861, both public and official\r\nBritish opinion discounted armed conflict, or at least any determined\r\nNorthern effort to recover the South. Early British attitude was,\r\ntherefore, based on a misconception. As this became clear, public\r\nopinion began to break from a united humanitarian pro-Northern sentiment\r\nand to show, in some quarters, quite another face. Even as early as\r\nJanuary the _Economist_ expressed wonder that the Northern States had\r\nnot availed themselves gladly of the chance to \"shake off such an\r\nincubus, and to purify themselves of such a stain[73].\" and a month\r\nlater professed to believe that Great Britain would willingly permit the\r\nNorth to secure compensation for loss of territory by annexing\r\nCanada--provided the Canadians themselves desired it. This, it was\r\nargued, would directly benefit England herself by cutting down military\r\nexpenditures[74]. The _London Press_ indulged in similar speculation,\r\nthough from the angle of a Canadian annexation of the Northern States,\r\nwhose more sober citizens must by now be weary of the sham of American\r\ndemocracy, and disgusted with the rowdyism of political elections, which\r\n\"combine the morals of a horse race, the manners of a dog fight, the\r\npassions of a tap-room, and the emotions of a gambling house[75].\"\r\nProbably such suggestions had little real purpose or meaning at the\r\nmoment, but it is interesting that this idea of a \"compensation\" in\r\nCanada should have been voiced thus early. Even in the United States the\r\nsame thought had occurred to a few political leaders. Charles Sumner\r\nheld it, though too wise, politically, to advance it in the face of the\r\ngrowing Northern determination to preserve the Union. It lay at the\r\nbottom of his increasing bitterness toward his old friend Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, now busy in schemes intended, apparently, to restore the\r\nUnion by compromise, and it led Sumner to hope for appointment as\r\nMinister to England[76].\r\n\r\nThe chief organ of British upper-class opinion, the _Times_, was one of\r\nthe first to begin the process of \"face about,\" as civil war in America\r\nseemed imminent[77]. Viewed from the later attitude of the _Times_, the\r\nearlier expressions of that paper, and in truth of many British\r\njournals, seem merely the customary platitudinous British holding up of\r\nhorrified hands at American slavery. On January 19, 1861, a strong\r\neditorial still proclaimed the folly of South Carolina, as acting\r\n\"without law, without justice,\" but displayed a real dismay at the\r\npossible consequences of war to British trade and commerce. On January\r\n22, the _Times_ reprinted an article from the _Economist_, on a probable\r\ncessation of cotton supply and editorially professed great alarm, even\r\nadvocating an early recognition of the Southern confederacy if needed to\r\nmaintain that supply. From this time on there is no further note in the\r\n_Times_ of the righteousness of the Northern cause; but while it is\r\nstill asserted that war would be folly, the strength of the South, its\r\nsuperiority as a military nation, are depicted.\r\n\r\nA long break of nearly six weeks follows with little editorial comment.\r\nSoon the correspondence from New York, previously written by Bancroft\r\nDavis, and extremely favourable to the Northern cause, was discontinued.\r\nW.H. Russell, the famous war correspondent of the Crimea, was summoned\r\nto London and, according to his own story, upon being given papers,\r\nclippings, and correspondence (largely articles from the _New York\r\nHerald_) supporting the right of the South to secede, hastily took his\r\ndeparture for America to report upon the situation[78]. He sailed from\r\nQueenstown on March 3, and arrived in New York on March 16. At last on\r\nMarch 12, the _Times_ took positive ground in favour of the justice of\r\nthe Southern cause.\r\n\r\n     \"No treachery has been at work to produce the disruption, and\r\n     the principles avowed are such as to command the sympathies\r\n     of every free and enlightened people. Such are the widely\r\n     different auspices under which the two rival Republics start\r\n     into existence. But mankind will not ultimately judge these\r\n     things by sympathies and antipathies; they will be greatly\r\n     swayed by their own interest, and the two Republics must be\r\n     weighed, not by their professions or their previous history,\r\n     but by the conduct they pursue and the position they maintain\r\n     among the Powers of the earth. Their internal institutions\r\n     are their own affair; their financial and political\r\n     arrangements are emphatically ours. Brazil is a slave-holding\r\n     Empire, but by its good faith and good conduct it has\r\n     contrived to establish for itself a place in the hierarchy of\r\n     nations far superior to that of many Powers which are free\r\n     from this domestic contamination. If the Northern Confederacy\r\n     of America evinces a determination to act in a narrow,\r\n     exclusive, and unsocial spirit, while its Southern\r\n     competitor extends the hand of good fellowship to all\r\n     mankind, with the exception of its own bondsmen, we must not\r\n     be surprised to see the North, in spite of the goodness of\r\n     its cause and the great negative merit of the absence of\r\n     Slavery, sink into a secondary position, and lose the\r\n     sympathy and regard of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThis to Northern view, was a sad relapse from that high moral tone\r\nearlier addressed to the South notifying slave-holders that England\r\nwould not \"stultify the policy of half a century for the sake of an\r\nextended cotton trade[79].\"\r\n\r\nThe _Economist_, with more consistency, still reported the violence and\r\nrecklessness of the South, yet in logical argument proved to its own\r\nsatisfaction the impossibility of Northern reconquest, and urged a\r\npeaceful separation[80]. The _Spectator_, even though pro-Northern, had\r\nat first small hope of reunion by force, and offered consolation in the\r\nthought that there would still remain a United States of America\r\n\"strong, powerful and free; all the stronger for the loss of the Black\r\nSouth[81].\" In short from all quarters the public press, whatever its\r\nsympathy, united in decrying war as a useless effort doomed to failure\r\nif undertaken in the hope of restoring the Union. Such public opinion,\r\nhowever, was not necessarily governmental opinion. The latter was indeed\r\nmore slow to make up its mind and more considerate in expressing itself.\r\nWhen it became clear that in all probability the North would fight,\r\nthere was still no conception, any more than in the United States\r\nitself, of the duration and intensity of the conflict. Indeed, Russell\r\nyet hoped, as late as the end of January, that no protracted war would\r\noccur. Nevertheless he was compelled to face the situation in its\r\nrelation to British commerce.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, Russell addressed Lyons on that aspect of possible war\r\nwhich would at once call for a determination of British policy. \"Above\r\nall things,\" he wrote, \"endeavour to prevent a blockade of the Southern\r\ncoast. It would produce misery, discord, and enmity incalculable[82].\"\r\nWithin a week Forster, a thorough friend of the North throughout the\r\nwhole war, was interrogating the Ministry in the House of Commons in\r\nregard to the situation at Charleston, and expressing the hope that\r\nEngland would not in any way attempt to interfere[83]. This was the\r\nfirst reference in Parliament, its sittings but just renewed after the\r\nlong vacation, to the American conflict, but British commercial\r\ninterests were being forced to a keener attention, and already men in\r\nmany circles were asking themselves what should be the proper\r\ngovernmental attitude; how soon this new Southern Confederacy could\r\njustly claim European recognition; how far and how fast European\r\ngovernments ought to go in acknowledging such a claim; what ought to be\r\nthe proper policy and position of a neutral power; whether, indeed, a\r\ndeclaration of neutrality ought to be issued.\r\n\r\nWith these questions rapidly coming to the front, it became important\r\nfor British statesmen to know something about the leaders in this new\r\nSouthern movement, the attitude of the people in general, and the\r\npurposes of the new Government. Here, unfortunately, Lord Lyons could\r\nbe no guide. The consuls in the South, however, were in a position to\r\ngive their impressions. On February 28, 1861, Bunch wrote to Russell,\r\ndescribing the election of Davis and Stephens[84], to the Presidency and\r\nVice-Presidency of the Confederacy, and giving a personal\r\ncharacterization of many members of the Government. He was rather\r\ncaustic. Davis, he said, was the only _able_ man, and he, unfortunately,\r\nwas a confirmed \"manifest destiny\" leader, so much so in fact that Bunch\r\nprophesied a renewal of filibustering when once the North had acquiesced\r\nin a Southern State and the fear of the North had passed. Bunch had no\r\nfaith in any future greatness of the South, asserting that it would be a\r\nState despised among nations for its maintenance of slavery, and that it\r\ncould not hope for any encouragement or sympathy from the humane nations\r\nof Europe; in fact, his entire characterization was wholly damning to\r\nthe South. Yet it is to be noted that he never for a moment questioned\r\nthat the South had already actually established its independence. This\r\nhe seems to take for granted. Thus again, and from another quarter,\r\nthere was presented the double difficulty of England in regard to the\r\nCivil War--the difficulty of reconciling sentiments of humanity long\r\npreached by Great Britain, with her commercial interests and her\r\ncertainty that a new State was being born.\r\n\r\nFor men in the Northern Government Lyons was in a position to report,\r\nbut up to the end of January he had not written in any great detail with\r\nregard to the new administration and its make-up, though on January 7,\r\nhe had informed Russell that Seward would be the Secretary of State and\r\nhad expressed the fear that with regard to Great Britain he would be \"a\r\ndangerous Foreign Minister[85].\" Lincoln was still in Illinois and the\r\nconstituency of the Cabinet was yet uncertain, but Seward's voice was\r\nsure to be a powerful one. Occasionally Lyons found some opportunity to\r\ntalk with him. On February 4, 1861, in an official letter to Russell,\r\nLyons reported at length an interview with Seward, in which the latter\r\nhad expressed his extreme confidence that the trouble in America was but\r\nsuperficial and that union sentiment in the South would soon\r\nprevail[86]. In a private letter of the same date, however, Lyons\r\nasserted that Seward was indeed likely to be a very dangerous Secretary\r\nof State. He had told Lyons that if European governments interfered to\r\nprotect their commerce, he could unite America by a foreign war in order\r\nto resist such interference[87]. Again, on February 12, while himself\r\nexpressing hope that a solution might be found for the difficulties in\r\nAmerica, Lyons warned Russell that there were those who would solve\r\nthese difficulties by a foreign war, especially if foreign governments\r\nrefused to acknowledge a United States declaration without formal\r\nblockade closing the Southern ports[88]. Writing privately, Lyons\r\nexhibited great anxiety in regard to Seward's attitude and suggested\r\nthat the best safeguard would be close union by England and France, for\r\nif these two governments took exactly the same stand in regard to trade,\r\nSeward would hardly dare to carry out his threat[89].\r\n\r\nLyons' letter of February 4 called out from Russell an instruction in\r\nwhich it was repeated that advice to either party should be withheld and\r\na strictly neutral attitude maintained, and Russell concluded by an\r\nassertion that if the United States attempted a jingo policy toward\r\nEngland, the British Cabinet would be tolerant because of its feeling of\r\nstrength but that \"blustering demonstrations\" must not be carried too\r\nfar[90]. Even as early as December, 1860, Russell had foreseen the\r\npossibility of what he considered a mere jingo policy for home effect in\r\nAmerica. Now, however, upon the repeated expression of fears from Lyons\r\nthat this might be more than mere \"bunkum,\" Russell began to instruct\r\nLyons not to permit English dignity to be infringed, while at the same\r\ntime desiring him to be cautious against stirring American antagonism.\r\nLyons' earlier disquietude seems, indeed, to have passed away for a\r\ntime, and on February 26 he wrote that everyone was waiting to see what\r\nLincoln would do when inaugurated, that there was still hope of\r\ncompromise, and that in his own view this was still possible. In this\r\nletter the tone is more important than the matter, and so far as Lyons\r\nis concerned the tone is all distinctly hopeful, all favourable to a\r\nresumption of normal relations between the North and South. He at least\r\nhad no hope of disruption, and no happiness in it[91].\r\n\r\nBefore this communication could reach England Russell had thoroughly\r\nawakened to the seriousness of the American situation in relation to\r\nBritish foreign trade. On March 9, writing privately to Lyons, he\r\nstated, \"I hope you are getting on well with the new President. If he\r\nblockades the Southern ports we shall be in a difficulty. But according\r\nto all American doctrine it must be an actual blockade kept up by an\r\nefficient force[92].\" Thus, before any act had really occurred in\r\nAmerica, the matter of a blockade was occupying the attention of British\r\nstatesmen. One difficulty at the time was that there was no one in\r\nEngland qualified to speak for the new administration at Washington.\r\nDallas, the American Minister appointed under the Buchanan\r\nadministration, while, unlike some other diplomatic representatives\r\nabroad, faithful to the cause of the United States, was nevertheless not\r\nwholly trusted by Lincoln or by Seward, and was thus handicapped in\r\nrepresenting to Russell American conditions or intentions. Indeed he had\r\nvery little communication with Russell. Adams' nomination to England was\r\nknown to Lyons on March 20, for on that day he telegraphed to Russell,\r\n\"Mr. Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts, is appointed Minister in\r\nLondon. I think it a very good appointment[93].\" This news was received\r\nin London on April 2, but over six weeks were yet to elapse before Adams\r\nreached his post. The appointment of Adams, however, seemed to Lyons a\r\nmatter of congratulation in his hope that no vicious anti-British policy\r\nwould be indulged in by Seward. Ten days after his telegram, he wrote at\r\nlength to Russell, making an excellent statement and analysis in regard\r\nto the character of Adams.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Adams is son of John Quincy Adams, the fifth P. of the\r\n     U.S., and grandson of John Adams, the second P. The\r\n     grandfather was the first Am. minister in England. The father\r\n     was one of the Plenipotentiaries who signed in London the\r\n     Convention of the 3rd July, 1815. Mr. Adams as a member of\r\n     the H. of R. for one of the districts of Mass., acted with\r\n     the less violent section of the 'Republican' Party. During\r\n     the last session of Congress he made a very remarkable\r\n     speech on the state of the Union, denying the reasonableness\r\n     of the complaints of the Southern States, but stating his\r\n     desire that every concession not inconsistent with honour and\r\n     principle should be made to them. He is considered to be a\r\n     man of great independence of character, and has the\r\n     reputation of being very tenacious of his own opinions. In\r\n     manner he is quiet and unassuming. He is a man of good\r\n     fortune. Mrs. Adams comes of a considerable family in Mass.,\r\n     of the name of Brooks. The late wife of Mr. Edward Everett,\r\n     who, as your L. is aware, has held the offices of Minister in\r\n     London and Secretary of State, was her sister[94].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar characterizations were being forwarded at almost the same time\r\nby Bunch in regard to the Southern Commissioners, now being despatched\r\nto London, but they were not so favourable. Mann, wrote Bunch, was the\r\nson of a \"bankrupt grocer.\" His personal character was \"not good,\" yet\r\nhe alone of the three Commissioners appointed had had diplomatic\r\nexperience. Yancey, it was stated, was an able lawyer, a stirring\r\norator, and a recognized leader of the secession movement, but he was\r\nalso extremely pro-slavery in his views, had expressed himself in favour\r\nof a renewal of the slave trade, and throughout his career had been a\r\n\"manifest destiny\" man. Of Rost, Bunch had no knowledge. In conclusion\r\nBunch described the extreme confidence expressed in the South in \"King\r\nCotton,\" and in rather bitter criticism stated that the Southern\r\nCommissioners thought even England, the foe of slavery, would now be\r\ncompelled to bend the knee and recognize the South in order to get\r\ncotton[95].\r\n\r\nThe Northern British Consuls on the other hand took an astonishingly\r\npro-Northern view of the whole situation. Archibald, consul at New York,\r\nwrote to Russell soon after the fall of Sumter, an exceedingly strong\r\nstatement of his faith in the power of the North and its fixed and\r\nunalterable determination to force the South back into the Union, his\r\nconfidence in Northern success, and his belief in the justice of the\r\nNorthern cause. He ventured to suggest the proper policy for England to\r\npursue, viz., to offer immediately her services in mediation but wholly\r\nand clearly on the side of the North. He stated that if England did not\r\nfeel free to offer mediation, she should at least show \"such a\r\nconsistent and effective demonstration of sympathy and aid\" for the\r\nNorth as would help in shortening the war[96]. The British Consul at\r\nBoston wrote to Russell in much the same vein. So far, indeed, did these\r\nmen go in expressing their sympathy with the North, that Lyons, on April\r\n27, commented to Russell that these consuls had \"taken the Northern War\r\nFever,\" and that he had mildly reproved Archibald[97].\r\n\r\nWith the inauguration of Lincoln on March 4, and the installation of\r\nSeward as Secretary of State, it was possible for Lyons to become more\r\nactive in his efforts to prevent a disruption of British Trade. On March\r\n20 he told Seward in a confidential conversation:\r\n\r\n     \"... If the United States determined to stop by force so\r\n     important a commerce as that of Great Britain with the\r\n     cotton-growing States, I could not answer for what\r\n     might happen.\r\n\r\n     \"... It was, however, a matter of the greatest consequence to\r\n     England to procure cheap cotton. If a considerable rise were\r\n     to take place in the price of cotton, and British ships were\r\n     to be at the same time excluded from the Southern Ports, an\r\n     immense pressure would be put upon Her Majesty's Government\r\n     to use all the means in their power to open those ports. If\r\n     Her Majesty's Government felt it to be their duty to do so,\r\n     they would naturally endeavour to effect their object in a\r\n     manner as consistent as possible, first with their friendly\r\n     feelings towards both Sections of this Country, and secondly\r\n     with the recognized principles of International Law. As\r\n     regards the latter point in particular, it certainly appeared\r\n     that the most simple, if not the only way, would be to\r\n     recognize the Southern Confederacy[98].\"\r\n\r\nThis was plain speaking, and Lyons' threat of recognizing the South did\r\nnot at the moment stir Seward to any retort. But five days later, on\r\nMarch 25, Lyons gave a dinner to Seward and a number of the foreign\r\nMinisters, and there Seward's violent talk about seizing any and all\r\nships that tried to trade with the South, even if there was no blockade,\r\nmade Lyons very anxious. As a host he diverted the conversation lest it\r\nbecome too acrimonious, but he himself told Seward\r\n\r\n     \"... that it was really a matter so very serious that I was\r\n     unwilling to discuss it; that his plan seemed to me to amount\r\n     in fact to a paper blockade of the enormous extent of coast\r\n     comprised in the seceding States; that the calling it an\r\n     enforcement of the Revenue Laws appeared to me to increase\r\n     the gravity of the measure, for it placed Foreign Powers in\r\n     the dilemma of recognizing the Southern Confederation or of\r\n     submitting to the interruption of their commerce[99].\"\r\n\r\nLyons' advice to Russell was that no rebuff should be given the Southern\r\nCommissioners when they arrived in London, but that they be treated\r\nwell. This, he thought, might open Seward's eyes to his folly. Still\r\nLyons did not yet fully believe that Seward would be so vigorous as his\r\nlanguage seemed to imply, and on March 29 he wrote that \"prudent\r\ncounsels\" were in the ascendant, that there would be no interference\r\nwith trade \"_at present_,\" and that a quieter tone was everywhere\r\nperceptible in Washington[100].\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the British Minister at Washington, the\r\ndanger spot in relations between the United States and Great Britain lay\r\nin this matter of interference with trade to Southern ports. Naturally,\r\nand as in duty bound, he sought to preserve that trade. At first,\r\nindeed, he seems to have thought that even though a civil war really\r\nensued the trade might continue uninterrupted. Certainly he bore hard\r\nand constantly on this one point, seeking to influence not only\r\nofficials at Washington but the public press. Thus, in a letter to Bunch\r\ndated April 12, 1861, at a time when he knew that W.H. Russell, the\r\n_Times_ correspondent, would shortly appear in Charleston, he instructed\r\nBunch to remember that in talking to Russell he must especially impress\r\nhim with the idea that any interruption of trade might and probably\r\nwould result in a British recognition of the South. Lyons wrote, \"...\r\nthe _only_ chance, if chance there still be of preventing an\r\ninterruption of the English commerce with the S. is the fear entertained\r\nhere, that it would lead to our recognizing the S.C.[101]\" In these\r\nwords is revealed, however, as in other communications from Lyons, the\r\nfact that he was striving to prevent an interruption of trade rather\r\nthan that he was convinced such interruption ought to result in a\r\nBritish recognition of the South. Indeed, as will be seen, when the\r\nblockade was at last declared, Lyons thought it no cause for recognition\r\nand was most tolerant of its early ineffectiveness.\r\n\r\nWhile Lyons was thus keeping in close touch with Seward, the relations\r\nbetween England and America at London were exceedingly meagre. All that\r\nthe American Minister Dallas knew of Russell's intentions is summed up\r\nin his despatches to Seward of March 22 and April 9, 1861[102]. On the\r\nformer date, he gave an account of an interview with Russell in which\r\nthe latter simply refused to pledge himself against a recognition of\r\nthe Confederacy; in the latter, presenting a long memorial written by\r\nSeward to all of the larger European Governments arguing in friendly\r\nspirit the cause of the North, Dallas reported that he drew from Russell\r\nmerely a general expression of England's kindly feeling towards the\r\nUnited States and her hope that there might still be a peaceful\r\nsolution. Russell again refused to make any pledge in regard to English\r\npolicy. In this interview it was tacitly agreed that it would be better\r\nfor Great Britain to await Adams' arrival before taking any definite\r\naction, or so at least Dallas understood Russell--though the latter\r\nlater denied that any pledge of delay was given. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that in Russell's mind, whatever he might say to Dallas, the\r\nseparation in America was an accomplished fact and the hope of Great\r\nBritain was centred upon the idea of a peaceful separation.\r\n\r\nUp to and including April 1, indeed, Lyons had been reporting that no\r\ndefinite stand was yet being taken by the American Government. At the\r\nsame time Russell was continuing his instructions to Lyons to recommend\r\nconciliation \"but never to obtrude advice unasked[103].\" Yet Russell was\r\nnot wholly undisturbed by the reports of Seward's quarrelsome attitude,\r\nfor in a private letter of the same date as the preceding, he wrote to\r\nLyons, \"I rely upon your wisdom, patience, and prudence, to steer us\r\nthrough the dangers of this crisis. If it can possibly be helped Mr.\r\nSeward must not be allowed to get us into a quarrel. I shall see the\r\nSoutherners when they come, but not officially, and keep them at a\r\nproper distance[104].\" It is an interesting query, whether this fear\r\nthus expressed of Seward's temper was not of distinct benefit to the\r\nUnited States at the moment when the Southern Commissioners arrived in\r\nEngland. The inference would seem to be clear, that in spite of Lyons'\r\nadvice to treat them well, the effect upon Russell of Seward's attitude\r\nwas to treat them coolly. Russell was indeed distinctly worried by\r\nSeward's unfriendly attitude.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the British press and public, while still uncertain and\r\ndivided as to the merits of the conflict were now substantially a unit\r\nin accepting separation as final. The _Times_, with judicial ponderosity\r\ndeclared: \"The new nationality has been brought forth after a very short\r\nperiod of gestation.... and the Seceding States have now constituted\r\nthemselves a nation[105] ...\" At the other end of the scale in newspaper\r\n\"tone,\" the _London Press_ jeered at the Northern American eagle as\r\nhaving \"had his tail pulled out and his wings clipped--yet the meek bird\r\nnow holds out his claws to be pared, with a resignation that would be\r\ndegrading in the most henpecked of domestic fowls[106].\" Having now\r\nveered about to expressions of confidence in the permanency of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy the _Times_ was also compelled to alter its opinion\r\nof Southern Statesmen. An editorial gave high praise to the Confederate\r\nCongress sitting at Montgomery, stated its personnel to be far superior\r\nto that of the Congress at Washington, yet was unable to resist making\r\nthe customary reference to manners traditionally American;\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to the Congress itself, we cannot refrain from\r\n     quoting the _naïve_ testimony of a visitor in its favour.\r\n     'Gentlemen here [Montgomery] who have spent much time in\r\n     Washington city declare that they have never witnessed such\r\n     industry, care, propriety, courtesy, and pleasant\r\n     Congressional action. _Not one member has appeared in his\r\n     seat under the influence of liquors or wines_, not a harsh\r\n     word has been uttered in debate, and all exhibit the most\r\n     unflagging energy and determination[107].'\"\r\n\r\nThe most of the British press quickly followed the lead of the _Times_,\r\nforgot its previous dictum that the South was in the control of\r\n\"ignorant ruffians,\" and dilated upon the statemanlike directness and\r\nsagacity of Southern leaders as contrasted with the stupidity of the\r\nNorth, displayed in its tariff policy[108]. A few journals thought that\r\nthe North might eventually win in a prolonged struggle but that such a\r\nvictory would be disastrous to the principles of federalism[109], and,\r\nin any case, that this civil war was one without \"a noble cause to\r\nsustain either side[110].\" By May nearly all the older journals were\r\naligned on the right of the South to secede, and on the fact of a\r\nsuccessful secession, though still differing as to the basic causes and\r\nessential justice involved. In this same month, however, there emerged a\r\nfew vigorous champions of the Northern cause and prospects. In April the\r\n_Spectator_ agreed that the Great Republic was at an end[111]; in May it\r\nurged the North to fight it out with hope, asserting a chance of\r\nultimate victory because of superior resources and the sympathy of all\r\nEuropean nations[112]. A small newspaper of limited circulation, the\r\n_Morning Star_, organ of John Bright, had from the first championed the\r\nNorthern cause. Now, as the armed conflict broke in America, it was\r\njoined by a more important paper, the _Daily News_, which set itself the\r\ntask of controverting the _Times_. Moreover the _Daily News_ was all the\r\nmore influential in that it was not uncritical of the North, yet\r\nconsistently, throughout the war, expressed sympathy for the cause and\r\nprinciples behind the efforts of the Northern Government. Selling for a\r\nlow price, twopence-halfpenny, the _Daily News_, like the _Westminster_\r\namong the Reviews, appealed to a broader and more popular constituency\r\nthan the older publications, especially to a constituency not yet vocal,\r\nsince still unrepresented, in Parliament[113].\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ was fortunate in having, after 1862, the best-informed\r\nNew York correspondent writing to the London press. This was an\r\nIrishman, E.L. Godkin, who, both at home and in America, was the\r\nintimate friend of literary men, and himself, later, a great moulder of\r\npublic opinion[114]. Harriet Martineau further aided the _Daily News_ by\r\ncontributing pro-Northern articles, and was a power in Radical\r\ncircles[115]. But literary England in general, was slow to express\r\nitself with conviction, though Robert Browning, by April, 1861, was\r\nfirmly determined in his pro-Northern sentiment. In August he was\r\nwriting in letters of the \"good cause[116].\" But Browning was a rare\r\nexception and it was not until the Civil War had been under way for many\r\nmonths that men of talent in the non-political world were drawn to make\r\ncomment or to take sides. Their influence at the outset was\r\nnegligible[117].\r\n\r\nIn spite of press utterances, or literary silence, alike indicative of\r\na widespread conviction that Southern independence was assured, there\r\nstill remained both in those circles where anti-slavery sentiment was\r\nstrong, and in others more neutral in sympathy, a distaste for the\r\nnewly-born State as the embodiment of a degrading institution. Lincoln's\r\ninaugural address denying an intention to interfere with slavery was a\r\nweapon for the friends of the South, but it could not wholly still that\r\nissue. Even in the _Times_, through the medium of W.H. Russell's\r\ndescriptive letters, there appeared caustic criticisms. He wrote in his\r\n\"Diary,\" \"I declare that to me the more orderly, methodical, and perfect\r\nthe arrangements for economizing slave labour ... are, the more hateful\r\nand odious does slavery become[118],\" and in his letter of May 8, from\r\nMontgomery, having witnessed an auction sale of slaves he stated:\r\n\r\n     \"I am neither sentimentalist nor Black Republican, nor negro\r\n     worshipper, but I confess the sight caused a strange thrill\r\n     through my heart. I tried in vain to make myself familiar\r\n     with the fact that I could, for the sum of $975, become as\r\n     absolutely the owner of that mass of blood, bones, sinew,\r\n     flesh and brains as of the horse which stood by my side.\r\n     There was no sophistry which could persuade me the man was\r\n     not a man--he was, indeed, by no means my brother, but\r\n     assuredly he was a fellow creature[119].\"\r\n\r\nThis was hard printing for the _Times_, in its new advocacy of the\r\nSouth, and Russell's description was made much of by the _Westminster\r\nReview_ and other publications that soon began to sound again the\r\n\"issue\" of slavery[120]. Yet the _Westminster_ itself in the same\r\narticle decried the folly of the Northern attempt at reconquest. So also\r\nthought even John Bright at the moment, when expressing himself\r\nprivately to friends in America[121].\r\n\r\nSlavery, then, still remained an issue before the British public, but of\r\nwhat use was it to upbraid the South, if a new world State were in fact\r\nborn? And if a State in power, why not give it prompt recognition? The\r\nextreme British anti-slavery opponents feared that this was just what\r\nthe Government was inclined to do, and with promptness. Here and there\r\nmeetings were hurriedly called to protest against recognition[122]. This\r\nfear was unfounded. Neither in London nor at Washington was there any\r\nofficial inclination to hasten recognition. Lyons had held up to Seward\r\nthe logic of such action, if British trade were illegally interfered\r\nwith. By April 9 Lyons was aware that the so-called Radical Party in the\r\nCabinet would probably have its way, that conciliation would no longer\r\nbe attempted, and that a coercive policy toward the South was soon to\r\nfollow. On that date he wrote to Russell stating that people in\r\nWashington seemed so convinced that Europe would _not_ interfere to\r\nprotect its trade that they were willing to venture any act embarrassing\r\nto that trade. He himself was still insisting, but with dwindling\r\nconfidence, that the trade must not be interfered with under any\r\ncircumstances. And in a second letter of this same date, he repeated to\r\nRussell his advice of treating the Southern Commissioners with\r\ndeference. Any rebuff to them, he asserts again, will but increase the\r\nNorthern confidence that they may do anything without provoking the\r\nresistance of England[123].\r\n\r\nLike a good diplomat Lyons was merely pushing the argument for all it\r\nwas worth, hoping to prevent an injury to his country, yet if that\r\ninjury did come (provided it were sanctioned by the law of nations) he\r\ndid not see in it an injury sufficient to warrant precipitate action by\r\nGreat Britain. When indeed the Southern capture of Fort Sumter in\r\nCharleston harbour finally brought the actual clash of arms, Lyons\r\nexpressed himself with regard to other elements in the struggle\r\npreviously neglected in his correspondence. On April 15 describing to\r\nRussell the fall of Sumter, he stated that civil war had at last begun.\r\nThe North he believed to be very much more powerful than the South, the\r\nSouth more \"eager\" and united as yet, but, he added, \"the taint of\r\nslavery will render the cause of the South loathsome to the civilized\r\nworld.\" It was true that \"commercial intercourse with the cotton States\r\nis of vital importance to manufacturing nations[124]....\" but Lyons was\r\nnow facing an actual situation rather than a possible one, and as will\r\nbe seen later, he soon ceased to insist that an interruption of this\r\n\"commercial intercourse\" gave reasonable ground for recognition of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Fort Sumter and the European recognition that a civil\r\nwar was actually under way in America, a large number of new and vexing\r\nproblems was presented to Russell. His treatment of them furnishes the\r\nsubject matter of later chapters. For the period previous to April,\r\n1861, British official attitude may be summed up in the statement that\r\nthe British Minister at Washington hoped against hope that some solution\r\nmight be found for the preservation of the Union, but that at the same\r\ntime, looking to future British interests and possibly believing also\r\nthat his attitude would tend to preserve the Union, he asserted\r\nvehemently the impossibility of any Northern interference with British\r\ntrade to Southern ports. Across the water, Russell also hoped faintly\r\nthat there might be no separation. Very soon, however, believing that\r\nseparation inevitable and the disruption of the Union final, he fixed\r\nhis hope on peaceful rather than warlike secession. Even of this,\r\nhowever, he had little real expectation, but neither he nor anyone else\r\nin England, nor even in America, had any idea that the war would be a\r\nlong and severe one. It is evident that he was already considering the\r\narrival of that day when recognition must be granted to a new,\r\nindependent and slave-holding State. But this estimate of the future is\r\nno proof that the Russian Ambassador's accusation of British\r\ngovernmental pleasure in American disruption was justified[125].\r\nRussell, cautious in refusing to pledge himself to Dallas, was using\r\nexactly such caution as a Foreign Secretary was bound to exercise. He\r\nwould have been a rash man who, in view of the uncertainty and\r\nirresolution of Northern statesmen, would have committed Great Britain\r\nin March, 1861, to a definite line of policy.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, Russell was still instructing Lyons to recommend\r\nreconciliation. April 8, Dallas communicated to Russell an instruction\r\nfrom Seward dated March 9, arguing on lines of \"traditional friendship\"\r\nagainst a British recognition of the Confederacy. Russell again refused\r\nto pledge his Government, but on April 12 he wrote to Lyons that British\r\nMinisters were \"in no hurry to recognize the separation as complete and\r\nfinal[126].\" In the early morning of that same day the armed conflict in\r\nAmerica had begun, and on the day following, April 13, the first\r\nSouthern victory had been recorded in the capture of Fort Sumter. The\r\nimportant question which the man at the head of the British Foreign\r\nOffice had now immediately to decide was, what was to be England's\r\nattitude, under international law, toward the two combatants in\r\nAmerica. In deciding this question, neither sentiment nor ideals of\r\nmorality, nor humanitarianism need play any part; England's _first_ need\r\nand duty were to determine and announce for the benefit of her citizens\r\nthe correct position, under International law, which must be assumed in\r\nthe presence of certain definite facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Dr. Newton asserts that at the end of the 'fifties Great\r\nBritain made a sharp change of policy.

There is no doubt about the\r\nearnestness with which these things are said.\" Russell's _Diary_ is\r\nlargely a condensation of his letters to the _Times_. In the letter of\r\nApril 30, 1861 (published May 28), he dilates to the extent of a column\r\non the yearning of South Carolina for a restoration of colonial\r\nrelations. But Consul Bunch on December 14, 1860, reported a Charleston\r\nsentiment very different from that of the Jockey Club in February. He\r\nwrote to Lyons:\r\n\r\n     \"The church bells are ringing like mad in celebration of a\r\n     newly revived festival, called 'Evacuation Day,' being the\r\n     _nefastus ille dies_ in which the bloody Britishers left\r\n     Charleston 78 years ago. It has fallen into utter disuse for\r\n     about 50 years, but is now suddenly resuscitated apropos _de_\r\n     nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same letter Bunch described a Southern patriotic demonstration.\r\nReturning to his home one evening, he met a military company, which from\r\ncuriosity he followed, and which\r\n\r\n     \"drew up in front of the residence of a young lawyer of my\r\n     friends, after performing in whose honour, through the medium\r\n     of a very brassy band, a Secession Schottische or Palmetto\r\n     Polka, it clamorously demanded his presence. After a very\r\n     brief interval he appeared, and altho' he is in private life\r\n     an agreeable and moderately sensible young man, he succeeded,\r\n     to my mind at any rate, in making most successfully, what Mr.\r\n     Anthony Weller calls 'an Egyptian Mummy of his self.' the\r\n     amount of balderdash and rubbish which he evacuated (_dia\r\n     stomatos_) about mounting the deadly breach, falling back\r\n     into the arms of his comrades and going off generally in a\r\n     blaze of melodramatic fireworks, really made me so unhappy\r\n     that I lost my night's rest. So soon as the speech was over\r\n     the company was invited into the house to 'pour a libation to\r\n     the holy cause'--in the vernacular, to take a drink and spit\r\n     on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently Southern eloquence was not tolerable to the ears of the\r\nBritish consul.

Both men had previously held the Premiership, and, as\r\nthey represented different wings of the Whig-Liberal party, it was\r\nprophesied by political wiseacres that personal friction would soon lead\r\nto a new disruption. Nor were the possible elements of discord confined\r\nto these two. Gladstone, formerly a Peelite Tory, and for a time\r\nuncertain whether to return to the Tory fold or to join the Liberals,\r\nhad yielded to Palmerston's promise of a free hand in financial matters,\r\nand had joined the Ministry as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Opposed to\r\nhim in a certain sense, as the rival claimant for political leadership\r\namong the younger group, was Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Home Secretary\r\nuntil July, 1861, thereafter until his death in April, 1863, Secretary\r\nfor War. Acting in some degree as intermediary and conciliator between\r\nthese divergent interests stood Lord Granville, President of Council,\r\nthen a \"Conservative-Liberal,\" especially valuable to the Cabinet for\r\nthe confidence reposed in him by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Palmerston was seventy-seven years old. Long before this he had\r\nbuilt his popularity upon a vigorous British \"patriotism,\" assertive of\r\nEngland's honour and jealous for British advantage. Now, however, as\r\nhead of a Government requiring the most delicate handling to maintain\r\nitself, he devoted his energies to details of political management in\r\nwhich he had great skill. His ambition was, primarily, to retain office,\r\nand in this purpose he was fortunate because, unknown to his ministerial\r\ncolleagues, he had received an indirect pledge from Lord Derby, the\r\nOpposition leader, that there would be, for a time at least, no\r\ndetermined effort to unseat him so long as his Ministry brought forward\r\nno Bill for a further expansion of the franchise. In the unwillingness\r\nto make any further adventure toward an expanded democracy Palmerston\r\nwas wholly at one with Derby. Of like opinion, though less strongly so,\r\nwas Russell, whose popular nickname, \"Finality John,\" gained by his\r\nassertion that the Reform Bill of 1832 was England's last step toward\r\ndemocracy, sufficiently indicates his stand on the franchise\r\nquestion. In fact every member of the Cabinet belonged to the\r\n\"Conservative-Liberal\" group, though with shades of political faith, and\r\nnone were really Liberals--far less Radicals. The outspoken Radicals in\r\nParliament, like John Bright, and his friend Cobden, who had refused to\r\ntake office under Palmerston, gave a lukewarm support to the Ministry,\r\nbut would not pledge themselves to steadfast adherence. They had hopes\r\nof Gladstone, believed that he would ultimately come into their group,\r\nbut meanwhile watched with anxiety his delighted immersion, as indeed\r\nPalmerston desired it, in the details of financial management to the\r\nexclusion of other questions.\r\n\r\nThe matter of ministerial and general British attitude toward democracy\r\nas affecting British policy during the American Civil War will be\r\nconsidered in a later chapter. In the spring of 1861 it had not become a\r\nclear-cut British opinion and did not, so far as historical evidence can\r\ndetermine, affect early governmental policy toward America. The\r\noutstanding feature of the British Government in 1861 is that it was\r\nmade up of various so-called \"Liberal\" elements, the representatives of\r\neach of which carried on the business of his own department much as he\r\npleased. Palmerston's was, of course, the deciding opinion, whenever he\r\ncared to express it, but this he did but rarely. His great concern was\r\nto keep his all-star associates running smoothly together and thus to\r\ngive no occasion for parliamentary criticism and attack. It followed\r\nthat Russell, eight years the junior of Palmerston, was in foreign\r\naffairs more powerful and independent than is customary. Indeed the\r\nGovernment was at times spoken of as the \"Palmerston-Russell Ministry.\"\r\nThese two were the leaders of the team; next came Gladstone and\r\nCornewall Lewis, rivals of the younger generation, and each eager to\r\nlead when their elders should retire from harness. Gladstone's great\r\nability was already recognized, but his personal political faith was not\r\nyet clear. Lewis, lacking his rival's magnetic and emotional qualities,\r\ncold, scholarly, and accurate in performance, was regarded as a\r\nstatesman of high promise[127]. Other Cabinet members, as is the custom\r\nof coalitions, were more free in opinion and action than in a strict\r\nparty ministry where one dominating personality imposes his will upon\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, then, in foreign policy, was more than the main voice\r\nof the Government; rather, save in times of extreme crisis, governmental\r\nforeign policy was Russell's policy. This was even more true as regards\r\nAmerican than European affairs, for the former were little understood,\r\nand dependence was necessarily placed upon the man whose business it was\r\nto be familiar with them. Indeed there was little actual parliamentary\r\nor governmental interest, before midsummer of 1861, in the American\r\nquestion, attention in foreign affairs being directed toward Italian\r\nexpansion, to the difficulties related to the control of the Ionian\r\nislands, and to the developing Danish troubles in Schleswig-Holstein.\r\nNeither did the opposition party venture to express a policy as regards\r\nAmerica. Lord Derby, able but indolent, occasionally indulged in caustic\r\ncriticism, but made no attempt to push his attack home. Malmesbury, his\r\nformer Foreign Secretary, was active and alert in French affairs, but\r\ngave no thought to relations across the Atlantic[128]. Disraeli, Tory\r\nleader in the Commons, skilfully led a strong minority in attacks on the\r\nGovernment's policy, but never on the American question, though\r\nfrequently urged to do so by the friends of the South. In short for the\r\nfirst year of the Civil War, 1861, the policy of Great Britain toward\r\nAmerica was the policy of Lord John Russell, unhampered by friend\r\nor foe.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, what did Russell know about the American crisis?\r\nBriefly, no more than has already been stated as derived from the\r\nreports of British officials in the United States, and from the pages of\r\nthe public press. The salient facts known to Russell were few. Lincoln's\r\nCabinet had been named. Lincoln himself was absolutely an unknown\r\nquantity, but it was unbelievable that a man of his origins and history\r\ncould be more than a mere figurehead--an opinion then held as widely in\r\nAmerica as in England. But someone must determine American policy, and\r\nby universal consent, this would be Seward.\r\n\r\nThe new Secretary of State was at the moment better known in England\r\nthan any other American statesman, with the possible exception of\r\nCharles Sumner, whose visits and personal contacts had established a\r\ncircle of British friendships. Both men were accepted as champions of\r\nanti-slavery, Sumner for his vigorous denunciations and his so-called\r\n\"martyrdom\" under the physical violence of the South Carolinan, Brooks;\r\nand Seward for his clever political anti-Southern leadership in the\r\nUnited States Senate. But Seward's reputation in this respect was offset\r\nby the belief that he was anti-British in his personal sentiments, or at\r\nleast that he was very ready to arouse for political ends the customary\r\nanti-British sentiment of his Irish constituents in the State of New\r\nYork. In 1860, on the occasion of the visit to the United States of the\r\nPrince of Wales, Seward is alleged to have stated to the Duke of\r\nNewcastle that in case he became Secretary of State it would then\r\n\"become my duty to insult England, and I mean to do so\"--a threat,\r\nwhether jocose or not, that aroused much serious and anxious speculation\r\nin British governmental circles[129]. Moreover Seward's reputation was\r\nthat of a wily, clever politician, rather unscrupulous in methods which\r\nBritish politicians professed to disdain--a reputation serving to dim\r\nsomewhat, as indeed it did in America also, the sincere idealisms and\r\npatriotism of the statesman. Altogether, Seward was regarded in Great\r\nBritain as a rather dangerous man, yet as the inevitable guiding power\r\nin the new Republican administration.\r\n\r\nThis estimate was shared by many in the United States also, but not by\r\nall. The new American Minister to London, Charles Francis Adams, himself\r\na most stiffly upright politician, both regarded Seward as the only\r\npossible leader of Republican party policy and rejoiced that this was\r\nso, having great confidence in his chief's integrity and wisdom. Adams\r\nhimself was well suited to his new post. He was known as having early in\r\n1849 fought the battle of anti-slavery as a \"Free Soil Whig,\" and later\r\nas a leading Republican member of Congress from Massachusetts.\r\nPrincipally, however, he was suited to his post by education, family,\r\nand character. He had been taken as a boy to Russia during his father's\r\nministry at St. Petersburg, and later had been educated in England. His\r\nfather and grandfather, John Quincy Adams and John Adams, both\r\nPresidents of the United States, had both, also, been American Ministers\r\nat London. Intensely patriotic, but having wide acquaintance through\r\ntraining and study with European affairs, especially those of Britain,\r\nand equipped with high intellectual gifts, Adams was still further\r\nfitted to his new post by his power of cool judgment and careful\r\nexpression in critical times. His very coolness, sometimes appearing as\r\ncoldness and stiff dignity, rendered him an especially fit agent to deal\r\nwith Russell, a man of very similar characteristics. The two men quickly\r\nlearned to respect and esteem each other, whatever clash arose in\r\nnational policies.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile Adams, in April, 1861, was not yet arrived in London. The\r\nSouthern Government organized at Montgomery, Alabama, but soon\r\ntransferred to Richmond, Virginia, was headed by Jefferson Davis as\r\nPresident and Alexander Stephens as Vice-President. Neither man was well\r\nknown in England, though both had long been prominent in American\r\npolitics. The little British information on Davis, that he had served in\r\nthe United States Senate and as a Cabinet member, seemed to indicate\r\nthat he was better fitted to executive duties than his rival, Lincoln.\r\nBut Davis' foreign policy was wholly a matter for speculation, and his\r\nCabinet consisted of men absolutely unknown to British statesmen. In\r\ntruth it was not a Cabinet of distinction, for it was the misfortune of\r\nthe South that everywhere, as the Civil War developed, Southern\r\ngentlemen sought reputation and glory in the army rather than in\r\npolitical position. Nor did President Davis himself ever fully grasp the\r\nimportance to the South of a well-considered and energetic foreign\r\npolicy. At first, indeed, home controversy compelled anxious attention\r\nto the exclusion of other matters. Until war cemented Southern\r\npatriotism, Davis, himself regarded as an extremist, felt it necessary\r\nin denial of an asserted unreasonableness of personal attitude, to\r\nappoint to office men known for their earlier moderate opinions on both\r\nslavery and secession[130]. \"The single exception to this general\r\npolicy[131]\" was the appointment as agents to Europe of Yancey, Rost and\r\nMann, all of them extreme pro-slavery men and eager secessionists. Of\r\nthese Mann was the only one with any previous diplomatic experience.\r\nYancey's choice was particularly inappropriate, for he at least was\r\nknown abroad as the extreme fire-eating Southern orator, demanding for\r\nten years past, that Southern action in defence of states rights and\r\nSouthern \"interests,\" which now, at last, the South was attempting[132].\r\n\r\nYancey and Rost, starting on their journey on March 16, reached London\r\non April 29[133]. Meanwhile in this same month of April, conditions in\r\nAmerica, so long confused and uncertain, were being rapidly clarified.\r\nThe South, earlier than the North, had come to a determined policy, for\r\nwhile during January and February, at the Montgomery convention, there\r\nhad been uncertainty as to actively applying the doctrinaire right of\r\nsecession, by March the party of action had triumphed, and though there\r\nwas still talk of conferences with the North, and commissioners actually\r\nappointed, no real expectation existed of a favourable result. In the\r\nNorth, the determination of policy was more slowly developed. Lincoln\r\nwas not inaugurated until March 4, and no positive pronouncement was\r\nearlier possible. Even after that date uncertainty still prevailed.\r\nEuropean correspondents were reporting men like Sumner as willing to let\r\nthe South go in peace. The Mayor of New York City was discussing the\r\nadvisability of a separate secession by that financial centre from\r\nNation and State alike--and of setting up as a \"free town.\" Seward, just\r\nappointed Secretary of State, was repudiating in both official and\r\nprivate talk any intention to coerce the South by force of arms[134]. It\r\nis no wonder that British statesmen were largely at sea over the\r\nAmerican situation.\r\n\r\nBut on April 13, 1861, the Stars and Stripes floating over Fort Sumter\r\nin Charleston harbour was lowered in surrender of a Federal fortress\r\nunder the armed attack of the newly-born Confederacy. That event drove\r\naway as by magic the uncertainty of the North, and removed the last\r\nvestiges of Southern doubt. A great wave of militant patriotism swept\r\nover both sections[135]. Hurriedly both North and South prepared for\r\nwar, issuing calls for volunteers and organizing in all accustomed\r\nwarlike preparations. The news of Sumter reached London on April 27, and\r\nthat civil war seemed certain was known on April 29. On April 17, Davis,\r\nsince the South lacked a navy, approved a proclamation offering to issue\r\nletters of marque and reprisal. On April 19 Lincoln proclaimed a\r\nNorthern intention to treat as pirates any privateers acting under such\r\nletters, and also gave notice of a blockade of Southern ports, to be\r\ninstituted later. Thus suddenly, so it seemed to British officials and\r\npublic after the long delay and uncertainty of months, events in America\r\nhad precipitated a state of war, though in fact there were still to\r\nelapse other months in which both North and South laboured to transform\r\na peaceful society into one capable of waging effective battle.\r\n\r\nThe result of this sudden change in the American horizon was to alter,\r\nalmost as quickly, the previous delay in outlining a British policy,\r\nthough, presumably, the British Government, while waiting the turn of\r\nevents, had given careful consideration to the steps required of it in\r\njust such a situation as had now arisen. Certainly both Lyons and\r\nRussell had been deeply anxious for some time, and had visualized a\r\nproper British policy. The movement in Great Britain now became rapid.\r\nOn April 29, Malmesbury, in the Lords, spoke of the news of civil war\r\nwhich had arrived \"this morning,\" and asked if the Government had tried\r\nto prevent it, or had set on foot negotiations with other powers to\r\ncheck it. Wodehouse, replying for the Government, stated that the United\r\nStates as an independent State would have resented any suggestions from\r\nGreat Britain, and that Lyons had been instructed to be extremely\r\ncareful about offering advice unless \"asked for by the contending\r\nparties themselves.\" Both speakers commented on the \"ties of blood\"\r\nrendering Britain especially anxious in this American quarrel, and\r\nregretted the conflict[136]. Malmesbury's query as to the approach to\r\nanother government, meaning France, was evaded. That some such approach,\r\nin accordance with the earlier advice of Lyons[137], had already been\r\nmade, is evident from the fact that three days later, on May 1, Dallas\r\nlearned from Russell of the plan of joint action with France, though\r\nwhat that action would be was not made clear[138]. As Dallas' report was\r\nsoon the basis of an American complaint shortly to be considered, the\r\nparagraph referring to this matter is important:\r\n\r\n     \"The solicitude felt by Lord John Russell as to the effect of\r\n     certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the\r\n     President induced him to request me to call at his private\r\n     residence yesterday. I did so. He told me that the three\r\n     representatives of the Southern confederacy were here[139];\r\n     that he had not seen them, but was not unwilling to do so,\r\n     _unofficially_; that there existed an understanding between\r\n     this government and that of France which would lead both to\r\n     take the same course as to recognition, whatever that course\r\n     might be; and he then referred to the rumour of a meditated\r\n     blockade of Southern ports and their discontinuance as ports\r\n     of entry--topics on which I had heard nothing. But as I\r\n     informed him that Mr. Adams had apprised me of his intention\r\n     to be on his way hither, in the steamship 'Niagara,' which\r\n     left Boston on the 1st May, and that he would probably arrive\r\n     in less than two weeks, by the 12th or 15th instant, his\r\n     lordship acquiesced in the expediency of disregarding mere\r\n     rumour, and waiting the full knowledge to be brought by my\r\n     successor. The motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be\r\n     further postponed, at his lordship's suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nMay 3rd, Russell held an unofficial interview with the two Southern\r\ncommissioners in fact arrived, Yancey and Rost. As reported by\r\nthem[140], Russell listened with attention to their representation, but\r\nmade no informing comment. They argued the constitutional right of\r\nsecession, depicted the firm determination of the South, were confident\r\nof early acquiescence by the North, and especially laid stress on the\r\nSouthern desire for free trade. Russell's own report to Lyons on this\r\ninterview and on one held six days later, May 9, is in substantial\r\nagreement, but much more is made by him than by the Commissioners of a\r\nquestion put by Russell as to a Southern plan of reviving the African\r\nslave-trade[141]. Yancey and Rost denied this and asserted \"that they\r\nhad prohibited the slave-trade, and did not mean to revive it.\" Their\r\nreport to Richmond does not depict this matter as of special\r\nsignificance in the interview; Russell's report to Lyons lays stress\r\nupon it. The general result of the interview was that Russell listened,\r\nbut refused, as to Dallas, to make any pledge on recognition. But the\r\nSouthern Commissioners came away with a feeling of confidence and were\r\ncontent to wait on British action[142].\r\n\r\nOn this same day, May 3, Russell received from the Attorney-General a\r\nmemorandum in reply to a query as to recognizing the belligerency of the\r\nSouth and as to the right of the South to issue letters of marque and\r\nreprisal. The memorandum notes that Southern privateering would be\r\ndangerous to British commerce with the North, but sees no help for it.\r\n\"The best solution,\" wrote the Attorney-General, \"would be for the\r\nEuropean nations to determine that the war between the two Confederacies\r\nshall be carried on on the principles of 'Justum Bellum,' and shall be\r\nconducted according to the rules of the Treaty of Paris. Recognize the\r\nSouthern States as a Belligerent on this condition only[143].\" The next\r\nday, referring to this memorandum, Russell wrote Lyons that the law\r\nofficers \"are of opinion that we must consider the Civil War in America\r\nas regular war[144],\" but he does _not_ comment on the legal advice to\r\npress the South to abandon privateering before recognizing her\r\nbelligerent rights, for this is the only meaning that can be attached to\r\nthe last sentence quoted from the Attorney-General's memorandum. This\r\nadvice, however, in view of the opinion that there was \"no help for it,\"\r\nwas presumably but a suggestion as to a possible diplomatic manoeuvre\r\nwith little confidence that it would succeed. The \"best solution\" was\r\nnot the probable one, for the South, without a navy, would not readily\r\nyield its only naval weapon.\r\n\r\nIn these few days British policy was rapidly matured and announced. The\r\nletter of May 4 to Lyons, stating the Civil War to be a \"regular war\"\r\nwas followed on May 6 by a formal instruction giving Lyons advance\r\nnotice of the determination reached by the Cabinet to recognize the\r\nbelligerent rights of the South. Russell indulged in many expressions of\r\nregret and sympathy, but Lyons was not to conceal that this British\r\naction represented the Government's view of the actualities of the\r\nAmerican situation. Yet while Lyons was not to conceal this opinion he\r\nwas not instructed to notify Seward, officially, of the recognition of\r\nSouthern belligerency[145]. Here was a correct understanding of the\r\ndifficulty of the diplomatic position at Washington, and a permitted\r\navoidance by Lyons of dangerous ground[146]. Russell was not then aware\r\nof the tenacity with which Seward was to cling to a theory, not yet\r\nclearly formulated for foreign governments, that the Civil War was a\r\nrebellion of peoples rather than a conflict of governments, but he does\r\nappear to have understood the delicacy of formal notification to the\r\nconstituted government at Washington[147]. Moreover his instructions\r\nwere in line with the British policy of refusing, at present, a\r\nrecognition of Southern sovereignty.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, May 6, a copy of the instructions to Lyons was sent to\r\nCowley, British Ambassador at Paris, directing him to request France to\r\njoin, promptly, in recognizing Southern belligerent rights. Cowley was\r\nalso instructed that the blockade and privateering required precautions\r\nby European governments, and it was suggested that France and England\r\nunite in requesting both belligerents to accede to the second and third\r\narticles of the Declaration of Paris[148]. These articles refer to the\r\nexemption from capture, except contraband, of enemy's goods under a\r\nneutral flag, and of neutral goods under an enemy's flag[149]. This day,\r\nalso, Russell stated in Parliament that England was about to recognize\r\nthe belligerent rights of the South, and spoke of the measure as a\r\nnecessary and inevitable one. May 7, Cowley notified Russell that\r\nThouvenel, the French Foreign Minister, was in complete agreement with\r\nEngland's policy[150], and on May 9, in a more extended communication,\r\nCowley sent word of Thouvenel's suggestion that both powers issue a\r\ndeclaration that they \"intended to abstain from all interference,\" and\r\nthat M. de Flahault, French Ambassador at London, had been given\r\ninstructions to act in close harmony with Russell[151].\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of movement in formulating policy in the six days from May\r\n1 to May 6, seems to have taken the British public and press somewhat by\r\nsurprise, for there is a lack of newspaper comment even after Russell's\r\nparliamentary announcement of policy on the last-named date. But on May\r\n9 the _Times_ set the fashion of general approval in an editorial\r\nstating that Great Britain was now coming to see the American conflict\r\nin a new light--as a conflict where there were in fact no such ideals\r\ninvolved as had been earlier attributed to it. Southern rights were now\r\nmore clearly understood, and in any case since war, though greatly to be\r\nregretted, was now at hand, it was England's business to keep strictly\r\nout of it and to maintain neutrality[152]. This generalization was no\r\ndoubt satisfactory to the public, but in the Government and in\r\nParliament men who were thinking seriously of specific difficulties\r\nrealized that the two main problems immediately confronting a British\r\nneutral policy were privateering and blockade. The South had declared\r\nits _intention_ to use privateers. The North had declared its\r\n_intention_, first to hang those who engaged in privateering, and second\r\nto establish a blockade. Neither declaration had as yet been put\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nThe first action of the British Government was directed toward\r\nprivateering. On May 1, Russell sent a note to the Lords Commissioners\r\nof the Admiralty calling attention to the Southern plan to issue letters\r\nof marque and reprisal and directing that reinforcements be sent to the\r\nBritish fleet in American waters. This was prompt action on unofficial\r\ninformation, for Davis' proclamation bore date of April 17, and Lyons'\r\ndespatch containing copies of it, sent on April 22, was not received by\r\nRussell until May 10[153]. Ordinary news from the United States required\r\nten days to get into print in London[154], but official messages might\r\nbe sent more rapidly by way of telegraph to Halifax, thence by steamer\r\nto Liverpool and by telegraph again to London. In case the telegram to\r\nHalifax coincided with the departure of a fast vessel the time was\r\noccasionally reduced to seven days, but never less. At the best the\r\nexact information as to the contents of the Davis and Lincoln\r\nproclamations of April 17 and 19 respectively, could have been received\r\nonly a few days before the order was issued to reinforce the\r\nBritish fleet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: F. Hollyer_. SIR WILLIAM GREGORY, K.C.M.G. (_From\r\nLady Gregory's \"Sir William Gregory, K.C.M.G.: An Autobiography,\" by\r\nkind permission_)]\r\n\r\nThe next day, May 2, Ewart, in the Commons, asked \"if Privateers sailing\r\nunder the flag of an unrecognized Power will be dealt with as Pirates,\"\r\nthus showing the immediate parliamentary concern at the Davis and\r\nLincoln proclamations. Russell stated in reply that a British fleet had\r\nbeen sent to protect British interests and took occasion to indicate\r\nBritish policy by adding, \"we have not been involved in any way in that\r\ncontest by any act or giving any advice in the matter, and, for God's\r\nsake, let us if possible keep out of it[155].\" May 6, Gregory, a friend\r\nof the South, who had already given notice of a motion for the\r\nrecognition of the Confederacy as an independent State, asked whether\r\nthe United States had been informed that a blockade of Southern ports\r\nwould not be recognized unless effective, and whether there would be\r\nacquiescence in the belligerent right of the South to issue letters of\r\nmarque and reprisal[156]. Russell replied that Lincoln had _not_ been\r\ninformed that a blockade must be effective to be respected since the\r\nWashington Government did not need to be told of an international rule\r\nwhich it had itself long proclaimed. As to the second point, he now\r\nannounced what heretofore had not been clearly stated, that Southern\r\nprivateers could not be regarded by Great Britain as pirates, for if so\r\nregarded Britain would herself have to treat them as pirates and would\r\nthus be unneutral. This was in fact, in spite of Northern bitter\r\naccusations that Britain was exhibiting governmental sympathy with the\r\nSouth by her tolerance of the plan of Southern privateering, an\r\ninescapable conclusion. Russell added, however, that the matter of\r\nprivateering involved some new questions under the Declaration of Paris\r\nupon which the Government had not yet decided what stand to take[157].\r\nIt was on this same day, in fact, that Russell had instructed Cowley to\r\ntake up with France the question of the Declaration of Paris[158],\r\nPrivateering and blockade, declared in America months before there was\r\nany possibility of putting them into effect, and months before there\r\nwere any military operations in the field, forced this rapid European\r\naction, especially the action of Great Britain, which, more than any\r\nother European nation, feared belligerent interference with her carrying\r\nand export trade. How was the British Government to know that Davis\r\nwould not bend every energy in sending out privateers, and Lincoln to\r\nestablish a blockade? The respective declarations of Davis and Lincoln\r\nwere the _first_ evidences offered of belligerent status. It was\r\nreasonable to assume that here would come the first energetic efforts of\r\nthe belligerents. Nor was British governmental intelligence sufficiently\r\ninformed to be aware that Davis, in fact, controlled few ships that\r\ncould be fitted out as privateers, or that two-thirds of the Northern\r\nnavy was at the moment widely scattered in foreign seas, making\r\nimpossible a prompt blockade.\r\n\r\nTo the British view the immediate danger to its commercial interests lay\r\nin this announced maritime war, and it felt the necessity of defining\r\nits neutral position with speed. The underlying fact of the fixity of\r\nSouthern determination to maintain secession had in the last few weeks\r\nbecome clearly recognized.\r\n\r\nMoreover the latest information sent by British officials in America,\r\nsome of it received just before the issue of the Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality, some just after, was all confirmative of the rapid approach\r\nof a great war. A letter from Bunch, at Charleston, was received on May\r\n10, depicting the united Southern will to resist Northern attack, and\r\nasserting that the South had no purpose save to conduct a strictly\r\ndefensive war. Bunch was no longer caustic; he now felt that a new\r\nnation was in process of birth[159]. May 4, Monson, writing from\r\nWashington, and just returned from a trip through the South, in the\r\ncourse of which he had visited Montgomery, stated \"_no reconstruction_\r\nof the Union is possible,\" and added that there was no danger of a\r\nservile insurrection, a matter that now somewhat began to disturb the\r\nBritish Government and public[160]. A few days later on, May 12, Lyons\r\nexpressed his strong sympathy with the North for reasons of\r\nanti-slavery, law, and race, but added that he shrank from expressions\r\nof sympathy for fear of thus encouraging the Northern Cabinet in its\r\nplan of prosecuting civil war since such a war would be frightful in its\r\nconsequences both to America and to England[161].\r\n\r\nSuch reports if received before the issue of the Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality must have strengthened the feeling that prompt action was\r\nnecessary; if received later, they gave confidence that that action had\r\nbeen wise. May 9, Forster asked in the Commons a series of questions as\r\nto the application of the British Foreign Enlistment Act in the American\r\ncrisis. What would be the status of British citizens serving on\r\nConfederate privateers? How would the Government treat citizens who\r\naided in equipping such privateers? Did not the Government intend to\r\ntake measures to prevent the infringement of law in British ports? Here\r\nwas pressure by a friend of the North to hasten an official announcement\r\nof the policy already notified to Parliament. Sir George Lewis replied\r\nstating that the Government was about to issue a general proclamation\r\nwarning British subjects not to take any part in the war[162]. Similar\r\nquestions were asked by Derby in the Lords on May 10, and received a\r\nsimilar answer[163]. The few days' delay following Russell's statement\r\nof May 6 was due to consideration given by the Law Officers to the exact\r\nform required. The Proclamation as issued was dated May 13, and was\r\nofficially printed in the _London Gazette_ on May 14.\r\n\r\nIn form and in substance the Proclamation of Neutrality did not differ\r\nfrom customary usage[164]. It spoke of the Confederacy as \"states\r\nstyling themselves the Confederate States of America,\" prohibited to\r\nEnglishmen enlistment on either side, or efforts to enlist others, or\r\nequipment of ships of war, or delivery of commissions to such ships. War\r\nvessels being equipped in British ports would be seized and forfeited to\r\nthe British Government. If a belligerent war-ship came into a British\r\nport, no change or increase of equipment was to be permitted. If a\r\nsubject violated the Proclamation he was both punishable in British\r\ncourts and forfeited any claim to British protection. The Parliamentary\r\ndiscussion on May 16 brought out more clearly and in general unanimity\r\nof opinion the policy of the Government in application of the\r\nProclamation; the South was definitely recognized as a belligerent, but\r\nrecognition of independence was for the future to determine; the right\r\nof the South to send out privateers was regretfully recognized; such\r\nprivateers could not be regarded as pirates and the North would have no\r\nright to treat them as such, but if the North in defiance of\r\ninternational opinion did so treat them, Great Britain had at least\r\nwarned its subjects that they, if engaged in service on a Southern\r\nprivateer, had no claim to British protection; a blockade of the South\r\nto be respected must be effective at least to the point where a vessel\r\nattempting to pass through was likely to be captured; the plan of\r\nblockading the entire Southern coast, with its three thousand miles of\r\ncoast line, was on the face of it ridiculous--evidence that Members of\r\nParliament were profoundly ignorant of the physical geography of the\r\nSouthern seaboard[165].\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary discussion did not reveal any partiality for one side\r\nin the American quarrel above the other. It turned wholly on legal\r\nquestions and their probable application. On May 15 Russell sent to\r\nLyons the official text of the Proclamation, but did not instruct him to\r\ncommunicate it officially to Seward, leaving this rather to Lyons'\r\ndiscretion. This was discretionary in diplomatic usage since in strict\r\nfact the Proclamation was addressed to British subjects and need not be\r\ncommunicated officially to the belligerents. In the result the\r\ndiscretion permitted to Lyons had, an important bearing, for recognition\r\nof Southern belligerency was opposed to the theory upon which the\r\nNorthern Government was attempting to proceed. Lyons did not then, or\r\nlater, make official communication to Seward of the Proclamation[166].\r\nThe fact soon appeared that the United States seriously objected to the\r\nProclamation of Neutrality, protesting first, its having been issued at\r\nall, and, in the second place, resenting what was considered its\r\n\"premature\" announcement by a friendly nation. This matter developed so\r\nserious a criticism by both American Government and public, both during\r\nand after the Civil War, that it requires a close examination. Did the\r\nBritish Government exhibit an unfriendly attitude toward the North by a\r\n\"premature\" Proclamation of Neutrality?\r\n\r\nOn May 13 the new American Minister landed at Liverpool, and on the\r\nmorning of the fourteenth he was \"ready for business\" in London[167],\r\nbut the interview with Russell arranged for that day by Dallas was\r\nprevented by the illness of Russell's brother, the Duke of Bedford[168].\r\nAll that was immediately possible was to make official notification of\r\narrival and to secure the customary audience with the Queen. This was\r\npromptly arranged, and on May 16 Adams was presented, Palmerston\r\nattending in the enforced absence of Russell. Adams' first report to\r\nSeward was therefore brief, merely noting that public opinion was \"not\r\nexactly what we would wish.\" In this he referred to the utterances of\r\nthe press, particularly those of the _Times_, which from day to day and\r\nwith increasing vigour sounded the note of strict neutrality in a\r\n\"non-idealistic\" war. On May 30 the _Times_, asserting that both parties\r\nin America were bidding for English support, summed up public opinion\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We have been told, in fact, by Northern politicians, that it\r\n     does not become us to be indifferent, and by Southern leaders\r\n     that they are half inclined to become British once more. Both\r\n     sides are bidding for us, and both sides have their partisans\r\n     over here. On such perilous ground we cannot walk too warily.\r\n\r\n     \"For our own part, we are free to confess that the march of\r\n     events has induced us to regard the dispute as a more\r\n     commonplace kind of quarrel than it at first appeared to be.\r\n     The real motives of the belligerents, as the truth\r\n     transpires; appear to be exactly such motives as have caused\r\n     wars in all times and countries. They are essentially selfish\r\n     motives--that is to say, they are based upon speculations of\r\n     national power, territorial aggrandizement, political\r\n     advantage, and commercial gain. Neither side can claim any\r\n     superiority of principle, or any peculiar purity of\r\n     patriotism....\r\n\r\n     \"We certainly cannot discover in these arguments anything to\r\n     remove the case from the common category of national or\r\n     monarchical quarrels. The representations of the North might\r\n     be made word for word by any autocrat or conqueror desirous\r\n     of 'rectifying' his frontier, consolidating his empire, or\r\n     retaining a disaffected province in subjection. The\r\n     manifestos of the South might be put forth by any State\r\n     desirous of terminating an unpleasant connexion or exchanging\r\n     union for independence....\r\n\r\n     \"It is just such a question as has been left times out of\r\n     mind in this Old World to the decision of the sword. The\r\n     sword will be the arbitrator in the New World too; but the\r\n     event teaches us plainly enough that Republics and\r\n     Democracies enjoy no exemption from the passions and follies\r\n     of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these impressions Adams presented himself on May 18 for his first\r\ninterview with Russell[169]. He stated that he had come with the idea\r\nthat there was\r\n\r\n     \".... little to do beyond the duty of preserving the\r\n     relations actually existing between the two nations from the\r\n     risk of being unfavourably affected by the unfortunate\r\n     domestic disturbances prevailing in my own country. It was\r\n     not without pain that I was compelled to admit that from the\r\n     day of my arrival I had felt in the proceedings of both\r\n     houses of Parliament, in the language of Her Majesty's\r\n     ministers, and in the tone of opinion prevailing in private\r\n     circles, more of uncertainty about this than I had before\r\n     thought possible,\"\r\n\r\nAdams then inquired whether the replies given by Russell to Dallas\r\nrefusing to indicate a policy as to recognition of the South implied a\r\nBritish purpose \"to adopt a policy which would have the effect to widen,\r\nif not to make irreparable, a breach [between North and South] which we\r\nbelieved yet to be entirely manageable by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nRussell here replied that \"there was no such intention\"; he had simply\r\nmeant to say to Dallas that the British Government \"were not disposed in\r\nany way to interfere.\" To this Adams answered that:\r\n\r\n     \".... it was deserving of grave consideration whether great\r\n     caution was not to be used in adopting any course that might,\r\n     even in the most indirect way, have an effect to encourage\r\n     the hopes of the disaffected in America.... It was in this\r\n     view that I must be permitted to express the great regret I\r\n     had felt on learning the decision to issue the Queen's\r\n     proclamation, which at once raised the insurgents to the\r\n     level of a belligerent State, and still more the language\r\n     used in regard to it by Her Majesty's ministers in both\r\n     houses of Parliament before and since. Whatever might be the\r\n     design, there could be no shadow of doubt that the effect of\r\n     these events had been to encourage the friends of the\r\n     disaffected here. The tone of the press and of private\r\n     opinion indicated it strongly.\"\r\n\r\nRussell's answer was that Adams was placing more stress on recent events\r\nthan they deserved. The Government had taken the advice of the Law\r\nOfficers and as a result had concluded that \"as a question merely of\r\n_fact_, a war existed.... Under such circumstances\r\n\r\n     it seemed scarcely possible to avoid speaking of this in the\r\n     technical sense as _justum bellum_, that is, a war of two\r\n     sides, without in any way implying an opinion of its justice,\r\n     as well as to withhold an endeavour, so far as possible, to\r\n     bring the management of it within the rules of modern\r\n     civilized warfare. This was all that was contemplated by the\r\n     Queen's proclamation. It was designed to show the purport of\r\n     existing laws, and to explain to British subjects their\r\n     liabilities in case they should engage in the war.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Adams answered \"... that under other circumstances\r\n\r\n     I should be very ready to give my cheerful assent to this\r\n     view of his lordship's. But I must be permitted frankly to\r\n     remark that the action taken seemed, at least to my mind, a\r\n     little more rapid than was absolutely called for by the\r\n     occasion.... And furthermore, it pronounced the insurgents to\r\n     be a belligerent State before they had ever shown their\r\n     capacity to maintain any kind of warfare whatever, except\r\n     within one of their own harbours, and under every possible\r\n     advantage. It considered them a marine power before they had\r\n     ever exhibited a single privateer on the ocean.... The rule\r\n     was very clear, that whenever it became apparent that any\r\n     organized form of society had advanced so far as to prove its\r\n     power to defend and protect itself against the assaults of\r\n     enemies, and at the same time to manifest a capacity to\r\n     maintain binding relations with foreign nations, then a\r\n     measure of recognition could not be justly objected to on any\r\n     side. The case was very different when such an interference\r\n     should take place, prior to the establishment of the proof\r\n     required, as to bring about a result which would not probably\r\n     have happened but for that external agency.\"\r\n\r\nThis representation by the American Minister, thus early made, contains\r\nthe whole argument advanced against the British Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality, though there were many similar representations made at\r\ngreater length both by Adams later, and by Seward at Washington. They\r\nare all well summarized by Bernard as \"a rejection ... of the\r\nproposition that the existence of war is a simple matter of fact, to be\r\nascertained as other facts are--and an assertion ... of the dogma that\r\nthere can be no war, so far as foreign nations are concerned, and,\r\ntherefore, no neutrality, so long as there is a sovereignty _de\r\njure_[170].\" But in this first representation Adams, in the main, laid\r\nstress upon the _haste_ with which the Proclamation of Neutrality had\r\nbeen issued, and, by inference, upon the evidence that British\r\nsympathies were with the South.\r\n\r\nOne British journal was, indeed, at this very moment voicing exactly\r\nthose opinions advanced by Adams. The _Spectator_ declared that while\r\nthe Proclamation, on the face of it, appeared to be one of strict\r\nneutrality, it in reality tended \"directly to the benefit of the\r\nSouth[171].\" A fortnight later this paper asserted, \"The quarrel, cover\r\nit with cotton as we may, is between freedom and slavery, right and\r\nwrong, the dominion of God and the dominion of the Devil, and the duty\r\nof England, we submit, is clear.\" She should, even though forced to\r\ndeclare her neutrality, refuse for all time to recognize the\r\nslave-holding Confederacy[172]. But the _Spectator_ stood nearly alone\r\nin this view. The _Saturday Review_ defended in every respect the issue\r\nof the Proclamation and added, \"In a short time, it will be necessary\r\nfurther to recognize the legitimacy of the Southern Government; but the\r\nUnited States have a right to require that the acknowledgment shall be\r\npostponed until the failure of the effort which they assert or believe\r\nthat they are about to make has resulted in an experimental proof that\r\nsubjugation is impossible[173].\" A few provincial papers supported the\r\nview of the _Spectator_, but they were of minor importance, and\r\ngenerally the press heartily approved the Proclamation.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Adams' interview with Russell on May 18 he has just\r\nreceived an instruction from Seward written under the impression aroused\r\nby Dallas' report of Russell's refusal on April 8 to make any pledge as\r\nto British policy on the recognition of Southern independence. Seward\r\nwas very much disturbed by what Russell had said to Dallas. In this\r\ninstruction, dated April 27[174], he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"When you shall have read the instructions at large which\r\n     have been sent to you, you will hardly need to be told that\r\n     these last remarks of his lordship are by no means\r\n     satisfactory to this government. Her Britannic Majesty's\r\n     government is at liberty to choose whether it will retain the\r\n     friendship of this government by refusing all aid and comfort\r\n     to its enemies, now in flagrant rebellion against it, as we\r\n     think the treaties existing between the two countries\r\n     require, or whether the government of Her Majesty will take\r\n     the precarious benefits of a different course.\r\n\r\n     \"You will lose no time in making known to Her Britannic\r\n     Majesty's Government that the President regards the answer of\r\n     his lordship as possibly indicating a policy that this\r\n     government would be obliged to deem injurious to its rights\r\n     and derogating from its dignity.\"\r\n\r\nHaving promptly carried out these instructions, as he understood them,\r\nAdams soon began to report an improved British attitude, and especially\r\nin the Government, stating that this improvement was due, in part, to\r\nthe vigour now being shown by the Northern Government, in part \"to a\r\nsense that the preceding action of Her Majesty's ministers has been\r\nconstrued to mean more than they intended by it[175].\" But at\r\nWashington the American irritation was not so easily allayed. Lyons was\r\nreporting Seward and, indeed, the whole North, as very angry with the\r\nProclamation of Neutrality[176]. On June 14, Lyons had a long\r\nconversation with Seward in which the latter stubbornly denied that the\r\nSouth could possess any belligerent rights. Lyons left the conference\r\nfeeling that Seward was trying to divide France and England on this\r\npoint, and Lyons was himself somewhat anxious because France was so long\r\ndelaying her own Proclamation[177]. To meet the situation, he and\r\nMercier, the French Minister, went the next day, June 15, on an official\r\nvisit to Seward with the intention of formally presenting the British\r\nProclamation and Thouvenel's instructions to Mercier to support it[178].\r\nBut Seward \"said at once that he could not receive from us a\r\ncommunication founded on the assumption that\r\n\r\n     the Southern Rebels were to be regarded as Belligerents; that\r\n     this was a determination to which the Cabinet had come\r\n     deliberately; that he could not admit that recent events had\r\n     in any respect altered the relations between Foreign Powers\r\n     and the Southern States; that he would not discuss the\r\n     question with us, but that he should give instructions to the\r\n     United States Ministers in London and Paris who would thus be\r\n     enabled to state the reasons for the course taken by their\r\n     Government to Your Lordship and to M. Thouvenel, if you\r\n     should be desirous to hear them.... He should not take\r\n     Official cognizance of the recognition of the Belligerent\r\n     Rights of Southern Rebels by Great Britain and France, unless\r\n     he should be forced to do so by an Official communication\r\n     addressed to the Government of the United States itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn the result the two Ministers submitted their papers to Seward \"for\r\nhis own use only.\" They did not regard the moment well chosen \"to be\r\npunctilious.\" Lyons reported that Seward's language and demeanour\r\nthroughout the interview were \"calm, friendly, and good humoured,\" but\r\nthe fact remained that the United States had not been officially\r\nnotified of the Proclamation of Neutrality, and that the American\r\nGovernment, sensitive to popular excitement in the matter and committed\r\nto the theory of a rebellion of peoples, was thus left free to continue\r\nargument in London without any necessity of making formal protest and of\r\ntaking active steps to support such protest[179]. The official relation\r\nwas eased by the conciliatory acquiescence of Lyons. The public anger of\r\nAmerica, expressed in her newspapers, astonished the British press and,\r\ntemporarily, made them more careful in comment on American affairs. The\r\n_Times_ told its readers to keep cool. \"It is plain that the utmost care\r\nand circumspection must be used by every man or party in England to\r\navoid giving offence to either of the two incensed belligerents[180].\"\r\nIn answer to the Northern outcry at the lack of British sympathy, it\r\ndeclared \"Neutrality--strict neutrality--is all that the United States\r\nGovernment can claim[181].\"\r\n\r\nWhile the burden of American criticism was thus directed toward the\r\nBritish recognition of Southern belligerency, there were two other\r\nmatters of great moment to the American view--the attitude of the\r\nBritish Government toward Southern privateers, and the hearing given by\r\nRussell to the Confederate envoys. On the former, Seward, on May 21,\r\nwrote to Adams: \"As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent\r\nservice, you will say that this is a question exclusively our own. We\r\ntreat them as pirates. They are our own citizens, or persons employed by\r\nour own citizens, preying on the commerce of our country. If Great\r\nBritain shall choose to recognize them as lawful belligerents and give\r\nthem shelter from our pursuit and punishment, the law of nations affords\r\nan adequate and proper remedy[182].\" This was threatening language, but\r\nwas for Adams' own eye, and in the next sentence of his letter Seward\r\nstated that avoidance of friction on this point was easy, since in 1856\r\nGreat Britain had invited the United States to adhere to the Declaration\r\nof Paris everywhere abolishing privateering, and to this the United\r\nStates was now ready to accede.\r\n\r\nWhat Seward really meant to accomplish by this was not made clear for\r\nthe question of privateering did not constitute the main point of his\r\nbelligerent letter of May 21. In fact the proposed treatment of\r\nprivateers as pirates might have resulted in very serious complications,\r\nfor though the Proclamation of Neutrality had warned British subjects\r\nthat they would forfeit any claim to protection if they engaged in the\r\nconflict, it is obvious that the hanging as a pirate of a British seaman\r\nwould have aroused a national outcry almost certain to have forced the\r\nGovernment into protest and action against America. Fortunately the\r\ncooler judgment of the United States soon led to quiet abandonment of\r\nthe plan of treating privateers as pirates, while on the other point of\r\ngiving \"shelter\" to Confederate privateers Seward himself received from\r\nLyons assurance, even before Adams had made a protest, that no such\r\nshelter would be available in British ports[183].\r\n\r\nIn this same letter of May 21 Seward, writing of the rumour that the\r\nSouthern envoys were to be received by Russell \"unofficially,\"\r\ninstructed Adams that he must use efforts to stop this and that: \"You\r\nwill, in any event, desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as\r\nwell as official, with the British Government, so long as it shall\r\ncontinue intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this\r\ncountry.\" Here was a positive instruction as to the American Minister's\r\nconduct in a given situation, and a very serious instruction, nearly\r\nequivalent to \"taking leave\" after a rupture of diplomatic relations,\r\nbut the method to be used in avoiding if possible the necessity of the\r\nserious step was left to Adams' discretion. Well might Adams' comment,\r\nwhen reporting the outcome, that this was the \"most delicate portion of\r\nmy task[184].\" Adams again went over with Russell the suspicion as to\r\nBritish intentions aroused in America by the Queen's Proclamation, but\r\nadded that he had not been able to convince himself of the existence of\r\nan unfriendly design. \"But it was not to be disguised that the fact of\r\nthe continued stay of the pseudo-commissioners in this city, and still\r\nmore the knowledge that they had been admitted to more or less\r\ninterviews with his lordship, was calculated to excite uneasiness.\r\nIndeed, it had already given great dissatisfaction to my Government. I\r\nadded, as moderately as I could, that in all frankness any further\r\nprotraction of this relation could scarcely fail to be viewed by us as\r\nhostile in spirit, and to require some corresponding action\r\naccordingly.\" Russell replied that both France and England had long been\r\naccustomed to receive such persons unofficially, as in the case of\r\n\"Poles, Hungarians, Italians, etc.,\" to hear what they had to say. \"But\r\nthis did not imply recognition in their case any more than in ours. He\r\nadded that he had seen the gentlemen once some time ago, and once more\r\nsome time since; he had no expectation of seeing them any more[185].\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment, then, a matter which under Seward's instructions might\r\nhave brought on a serious crisis was averted by the tact of Adams and\r\nthe acquiescence of Russell. Yet no pledge had been given; Russell\r\nmerely stated that he had \"no expectation\" of further interviews with\r\nthe Southern commissioners; he was still ready to hear from them in\r\nwriting. This caused a division of opinion between the commissioners;\r\nYancey argued that Russell's concession to Adams was itself a violation\r\nof the neutrality the British Government had announced, and that it\r\nshould be met by a formal protest. But the other members insisted on a\r\nreference to Richmond for instructions[186]. On the same day that Adams\r\nreported the result to Seward he wrote privately to his son in Boston:\r\n\r\n     \"My position here thus far has not been difficult or painful.\r\n     If I had followed the course of some of my colleagues in the\r\n     diplomatic line, this country might have been on the high\r\n     road to the confederate camp before now. It did not seem to\r\n     me to be expedient so to play into the hands of our\r\n     opponents. Although there has been and is more or less of\r\n     sympathy with the slave-holders in certain circles, they are\r\n     not so powerful as to overbear the general sentiment of the\r\n     people. The ministry has been placed in rather delicate\r\n     circumstances, when a small loss of power on either extreme\r\n     would have thrown them out[187].\"\r\n\r\nIn Adams' opinion the Liberals were on the whole more friendly, at\r\nleast, to the North than were the Conservatives, and he therefore\r\nconsidered it best not to press too harshly upon the Government.\r\n\r\nBut the concluding sentence of this same letter was significant: \"I wait\r\nwith patience--but as yet I have not gone so far as to engage a house\r\nfor more than a month at a time....\" He might himself be inclined to\r\nview more leniently the Proclamation of Neutrality and be able to find\r\nexcuses for the alleged haste with which it had been issued, but his\r\ninstructions required strong representations, especially on the latter\r\npoint. Adams' report to Seward of June 14, just noted, on the interview\r\nwith Russell of June 12, after treating of privateering and the Southern\r\ncommissioners, turns in greater length to the alleged pledge of delay\r\ngiven by Russell to Dallas, and to the violation of that pledge in a\r\nhasty issue of the Proclamation. He renews attack on the line already\r\ntaken on May 18[188]. From this time on, throughout and after the war,\r\nthis criticism was repeatedly made and with increasing bitterness.\r\nBritish friends of the North joined in the American outcry. By mere\r\nreiteration it became in the popular mind on both sides of the Atlantic\r\nan accepted and well-founded evidence of British governmental\r\nunfriendliness in May, 1861. At the conclusion of the Civil War, John\r\nBright in Parliament, commenting on the causes of American ill-will,\r\ndeclared that the Government of 1861, knowing that Adams was on his way,\r\nshould in mere courtesy, have waited his arrival. Then, said Bright, the\r\nProclamation, entirely justifiable in itself, might have been issued\r\nwithout offence and without embittering the United States[189].\r\n\r\nHad in fact a \"pledge to wait\" been given to Dallas; and was the\r\nProclamation hasty and premature? Russell always denied he had given any\r\nsuch pledge, and the text of Dallas' report of the interview of May 1\r\nwould seem to support that denial[190]. On that day Russell for the\r\nsecond time told Dallas that England would not commit herself, as yet,\r\nas regards Southern recognition, clearly meaning a recognition of\r\n_sovereignty_, not of belligerency, and immediately asked Dallas what\r\nthe rumours of a blockade meant. Dallas replied that he had no\r\ninformation on this point, and Russell \"acquiesced in the expediency of\r\ndisregarding mere rumour, and waiting the full knowledge to be brought\r\nby my successor. The motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be further\r\npostponed, at his lordship's suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nThe unprejudiced interpretation of this report is merely that Russell\r\nrefrained from pressing Dallas about a matter--blockade--of which Dallas\r\nknew nothing, agreeing that this would be explained by Adams, and\r\nespecially that he let Dallas understand that Gregory's motion, which\r\nwas one for _recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the South_,\r\nwould be postponed. If there was a pledge here it was a pledge not to\r\nrecognize Southern sovereignty until after Adams' arrival.\r\n\r\nBut even if there was no promise of delay \"there can be no question,\"\r\nwrites the son of Adams in a brief biography of his father, \"that the\r\nproclamation of the 13th was issued with unseemly haste.... The purpose\r\nwas manifest. It was to have the status of the Confederacy as a\r\nbelligerent an accomplished fact before the arrival of the newly\r\naccredited minister. This precipitate action was chiefly significant as\r\nindicating an animus; that animus being really based on ... the belief,\r\nalready matured into a conviction, that the full recognition of the\r\nConfederacy as an independent power was merely a question of time, and\r\nprobably of a very short time[191].\" The author does not, however,\r\nsupport the contemporary American contention that _any_ Proclamation was\r\ncontrary to international custom and that no recognition of belligerent\r\nstatus was permissible to neutrals until the \"insurgents\" had forced the\r\nmother country itself to recognize the division as fully accomplished,\r\neven while war still continued. Indeed American practice was flatly\r\ncontradictory of the argument, as in the very pertinent example of the\r\npetty Canadian rebellion of 1837, when President Van Buren had promptly\r\nissued a proclamation of neutrality. It is curious that in his several\r\nreplies to Seward's complaints Russell did not quote a letter from\r\nStevenson, the American Minister to London, addressed to Palmerston, May\r\n22, 1838. Stevenson was demanding disavowal and disapproval of the\r\n\"Caroline\" affair, and incidentally he asserted as an incontrovertible\r\nprinciple \"that civil wars are not distinguished from other wars, as to\r\nbelligerent and neutral rights; that they stand upon the same ground,\r\nand are governed by the same principles; that whenever a portion of a\r\nState seek by force of arms to overthrow the Government, and maintain\r\nindependence, the contest becomes one _de facto_ of war[192].\" This was\r\nas exact, and correct, a statement of the British view as could have\r\nbeen desired[193].\r\n\r\nThe American Minister, whatever his official representation, did not\r\nthen hold, privately, the view of \"unfriendly animus.\" On July 2, 1861,\r\nhis secretary son wrote: \"The English are really on our side; of that I\r\nhave no doubt whatever. [Later he was less sure of this.] But they\r\nthought that as a dissolution seemed inevitable and as we seemed to have\r\nmade up our minds to it, that their Proclamation was just the thing to\r\nkeep them straight with both sides, and when it turned out otherwise\r\nthey did their best to correct their mistake[194].\" The modern\r\nhistorical judgment of the best American writers likewise exonerates the\r\nBritish Government of \"unfriendly animus[195],\" but is still apt to\r\nrefer to the \"premature\" issue of the Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThis was also John Bright's view. But can Russell and the Government be\r\ncriticized even as exercising an unwise (not unfriendly) haste? Henry\r\nAdams wrote that the British thought the \"dissolution seemed inevitable\"\r\nand \"we seemed to have made up our minds to it.\" Certainly this was a\r\njustifiable conclusion from the events in America from Lincoln's\r\nelection in November, 1860, to his inauguration in March, 1861--and even\r\nto a later date, almost in fact to the first week in April. During this\r\nperiod the British Ministry preserved a strictly \"hands off\" policy.\r\nThen, suddenly, actual conflict begins and at once each side in America\r\nissues declarations, Davis on privateering, Lincoln on blockade and\r\npiracy, indicative that _maritime_ war, the form of war at once most\r\ndangerous to British interests and most likely to draw in British\r\ncitizens, was the method first to be tried by the contestants. Unless\r\nthese declarations were mere bluff and bluster England could not dare\r\nwait their application. She must at once warn her citizens and make\r\nclear her position as a neutral. The Proclamation was no effort \"to keep\r\nstraight with both sides\"; it was simply the natural, direct, and prompt\r\nnotification to British subjects required in the presence of a _de\r\nfacto_ war.\r\n\r\nMoreover, merely as a matter of historical speculation, it was fortunate\r\nthat the Proclamation antedated the arrival of Adams. The theory of the\r\nNorthern administration under which the Civil War was begun and\r\nconcluded was that a portion of the people of the United States were\r\nstriving as \"insurgents\" to throw off their allegiance, and that there\r\ncould be no recognition of any Southern _Government_ in the conflict. In\r\nactual practice in war, the exchange of prisoners and like matters, this\r\ntheory had soon to be discarded. Yet it was a far-seeing and wise theory\r\nnevertheless in looking forward to the purely domestic and\r\nconstitutional problem of the return to the Union, when conquered, of\r\nthe sections in rebellion. This, unfortunately, was not clear to foreign\r\nnations, and it necessarily complicated relations with them. Yet under\r\nthat theory Adams had to act. Had he arrived before the Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality it is difficult to see how he could have proceeded otherwise\r\nthan to protest, officially, against any British declaration of\r\nneutrality, declaring that his Government did not acknowledge a state of\r\nwar as existing, and threatening to take his leave. It would have been\r\nhis duty to _prevent_, if possible, the issue of the Proclamation.\r\nDallas, fortunately, had been left uninformed and uninstructed. Adams,\r\nfortunately, arrived too late to prevent and had, therefore, merely to\r\ncomplain. The \"premature\" issue of the Proclamation averted an\r\ninevitable rupture of relations on a clash between the American theory\r\nof \"no state of war\" and the international fact that war existed. Had\r\nthat rupture occurred, how long would the British Government and people\r\nhave remained neutral, and what would have been the ultimate fate of the\r\nUnited States[196]?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Sir George Cornewall Lewis was better informed in the\r\nearly stages of the American conflict than any of his ministerial\r\ncolleagues.

This blunt\r\nexpression of Great Britain's Foreign Secretary offers an interesting\r\ncomparison with the words of the American President Wilson, in a\r\nparallel statement at the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. Wilson on\r\nAugust 3, 1914, gave a special audience to newspaper correspondents,\r\nbegging them to maintain an attitude of calm impartiality. On August 4\r\nhe issued the first of several neutrality proclamations in which,\r\nfollowing the customary language of such documents, the people were\r\nnotified that neutrality did not restrict the \"full and free expression\r\nof sympathies in public and in private.\" But on August 18 in an address\r\nto the people of the United States, this legal phraseology, required by\r\ntraditional usage was negatived by Wilson's appeal that \"we must be\r\nimpartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our\r\nsentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as\r\na preference of one party to the struggle before another.\" And three\r\nweeks later, on September 8, came the proclamation setting aside October\r\n4 \"as a day of prayer to Almighty God,\" informing Him that war existed\r\nand asking His intervention.

In fact, however, there were intimately connected wth these\r\nformal arguments and instructions of the American Secretary of State a\r\nplan of possible militant action against Great Britain and a suspicion,\r\nin British Governmental circles, that this plan was being rapidly\r\nmatured. American historians have come to stigmatize this plan as\r\n\"Seward's Foreign War Panacea,\" and it has been examined by them in\r\ngreat detail, so that there is no need here to do more than state its\r\nmain features. That which is new in the present treatment is the British\r\ninformation in regard to the plan and the resultant British suspicion of\r\nSeward's intentions.\r\n\r\nThe British public, as distinguished from the Government, deriving its\r\nknowledge of Seward from newspaper reports of his career and past\r\nutterances, might well consider him as traditionally unfriendly to Great\r\nBritain. He had, in the 'fifties, vigorously attacked the British\r\ninterpretation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and characterized Great\r\nBritain as \"the most grasping and the most rapacious Power in the\r\nworld\"; he had long prophesied the ultimate annexation of Canada to the\r\nUnited States; he had not disdained, in political struggles in the State\r\nof New York, to whip up, for the sake of votes, Irish antagonism to\r\nGreat Britain; and more especially and more recently he had been\r\nreported to have expressed to the Duke of Newcastle a belief that civil\r\nconflict in America could easily be avoided, or quieted, by fomenting a\r\nquarrel with England and engaging in a war against her[197]. Earlier\r\nexpressions might easily be overlooked as emanating from a politician\r\nnever over-careful about wounding the sensibilities of foreign nations\r\nand peoples, for he had been even more outspoken against the France of\r\nLouis Napoleon, but the Newcastle conversation stuck in the British mind\r\nas indicative of a probable animus when the politician had become the\r\nstatesman responsible for foreign policy. Seward might deny, as he did,\r\nthat he had ever uttered the words alleged[198], and his friend Thurlow\r\nWeed might describe the words as \"badinage,\" in a letter to the London\r\n_Times_[199], but the \"Newcastle story\" continued to be matter for\r\nfrequent comment both in the Press and in private circles.\r\n\r\nBritish Ministers, however, would have paid little attention to Seward's\r\nspeeches intended for home political consumption, or to a careless bit\r\nof social talk, had there not been suspicion of other and more serious\r\nevidences of unfriendliness. Lyons was an unusually able and\r\nwell-informed Minister, and from the first he had pictured the\r\nleadership of Seward in the new administration at Washington, and had\r\nhimself been worried by his inability to understand what policy Seward\r\nwas formulating. But, in fact, he did not see clearly what was going on\r\nin the camp of the Republican party now dominant in the North. The\r\nessential feature of the situation was that Seward, generally regarded\r\nas the man whose wisdom must guide the ill-trained Lincoln, and himself\r\nthinking this to be his destined function, early found his authority\r\nchallenged by other leaders, and his policies not certain of\r\nacceptance by the President. It is necessary to review, briefly, the\r\nsituation at Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HENRY SEWARD (_From Lord Newton's \"Life of Lord\r\nLyons,\" by kind permission_)]\r\n\r\nLincoln was inaugurated as President on March 4. He had been elected as\r\na Republican by a political party never before in power. Many of the\r\nleading members of this party were drawn from the older parties and had\r\nbeen in administrative positions in either State or National\r\nGovernments, but there were no party traditions, save the lately created\r\none of opposition to the expansion of slavery to the Territories. All\r\nwas new, then, to the men now in power in the National Government, and a\r\nnew and vital issue, that of secession already declared by seven\r\nSouthern States, had to be met by a definite policy. The important\r\nimmediate question was as to whether Lincoln had a policy, or, if not,\r\nupon whom he would depend to guide him.\r\n\r\nIn the newly-appointed Cabinet were two men who, in popular estimate,\r\nwere expected to take the lead--Chase, of Ohio, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and Seward, of New York, Secretary of State. Both were\r\nexperienced in political matters and both stood high in the esteem of\r\nthe anti-slavery element in the North, but Seward, all things\r\nconsidered, was regarded as the logical leading member of the Cabinet.\r\nHe had been the favoured candidate for Republican Presidential\r\nnomination in 1860, making way for Lincoln only on the theory that the\r\nlatter as less Radical on anti-slavery, could be more easily elected.\r\nAlso, he now held that position which by American tradition was regarded\r\nas the highest in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn fact, everyone at Washington regarded it as certain that Seward would\r\ndetermine the policy of the new administration. Seward's own attitude is\r\nwell summed up in a despatch to his Government, February 18, 1861, by\r\nRudolph Schleiden, Minister from the Republic of Bremen. He described a\r\nconversation with Seward in regard to his relations with Lincoln:\r\n\r\n     \"Seward, however, consoled himself with the clever remark,\r\n     that there is no great difference between an elected\r\n     president of the United States and an hereditary monarch. The\r\n     latter is called to the throne through the accident of birth,\r\n     the former through the chances which make his election\r\n     possible. The actual direction of public affairs belongs to\r\n     the leader of the ruling party, here as well as in any\r\n     hereditary principality.\r\n\r\n     \"The future President is a self-made man and there is\r\n     therefore as little doubt of his energy as of his proverbial\r\n     honesty ('honest old Abe'). It is also acknowledged that he\r\n     does not lack common sense. But his other qualities for the\r\n     highest office are practically unknown. His election may\r\n     therefore be readily compared with a lottery. It is possible\r\n     that the United States has drawn the first prize, on the\r\n     other hand the gain may only have been a small one. But\r\n     unfortunately the possibility is not excluded that it may\r\n     have been merely a blank.\"\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of this quotation reports Seward's opinion; the\r\nsecond is apparently Schleiden's own estimate. Two weeks later Schleiden\r\nsent home a further analysis of Lincoln:\r\n\r\n     \"He makes the impression of a natural man of clear and\r\n     healthy mind, great good-naturedness and best intentions. He\r\n     seems to be fully conscious of the great responsibility which\r\n     rests upon him. But at the same time it appears as if he had\r\n     lost some of his famous firmness and resoluteness through the\r\n     novelty of the conditions which surround him and the hourly\r\n     renewed attempts from various sides to gain influence over\r\n     him. He is therefore at present inclined to concede double\r\n     weight to the superior political experience of his Secretary\r\n     of State[200].\"\r\n\r\nThis was written on March 4, and the situation was correctly described.\r\nSeward led for the moment, but his supremacy was not unchallenged and\r\nsoon a decision was called for that in its final solution was to\r\ncompletely overthrow his already matured policy towards the seceding\r\nStates. Buchanan had been pressed by South Carolina to yield possession\r\nof federal property in that State and especially to withdraw Federal\r\ntroops from Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbour. After some vacillation he\r\nhad refused to do this, but had taken no steps to reinforce and\r\nre-supply the weak garrison under the command of Major Anderson. On\r\nMarch 5, Lincoln learned that Sumter would soon have to be yielded\r\nunless reinforcements were sent. There followed ten days of delay and\r\nindecision; then on March 15 Lincoln requested from each member of his\r\nCabinet an opinion on what should be done. This brought to an issue the\r\nwhole question of Seward's policy and leadership.\r\n\r\nFor Seward's policy, like that of Buchanan, was one of conciliatory\r\ndelay, taking no steps to bring matters to an issue, and trusting to\r\ntime and a sobering second thought to bring Southern leaders and people\r\nto a less violent attitude. He sincerely believed in the existence of an\r\nas yet unvoiced strong Union sentiment in the South, especially in those\r\nStates which were wavering on secession. He was holding communications,\r\nthrough intermediaries, with certain Confederate \"Commissioners\" in\r\nWashington, and he had agents in Virginia attempting to influence that\r\nState against secession. To all these Southern representatives he now\r\nconveyed assurances quite without warrant from Lincoln, that Sumter\r\nwould be evacuated, acting solely in the belief that his own \"policy\"\r\nwould be approved by the President. His argument in reply to Lincoln's\r\ncall for an opinion was positive against reinforcing Fort Sumter, and it\r\nseemed to meet, for the moment, with the approval of the majority of his\r\nCabinet colleagues. Lincoln himself made no pertinent comment, yet did\r\nnot commit himself.\r\n\r\nThere the matter rested for a time, for the Confederate Commissioners,\r\nregarding Seward's policy of delay as wholly beneficial to the maturing\r\nof Southern plans, and Seward \"as their cat's-paw[201],\" did not care to\r\npress for a decision. Moreover, Seward had given a personal pledge that\r\nin case it were, after all, determined to reinforce Sumter, notification\r\nof that determination would at once be given to South Carolina. The days\r\nwent by, and it was not until the last week of March that Lincoln,\r\ndisillusioned as to the feasibility of Seward's policy of conciliation,\r\nreached the conclusion that in his conception of his duty as President\r\nof the United States he must defend and retain Federal forts, or attempt\r\nto retain them, for the preservation of the Union, and decided to\r\nreinforce Fort Sumter. On March 29, the Cabinet assembled at noon and\r\nlearned Lincoln's determination.\r\n\r\nThis was a sharp blow to Seward's prestige in the Cabinet; it also\r\nthreatened his \"peaceful\" policy. Yet he did not as yet understand fully\r\nthat either supreme leadership, or control of policy, had been assumed\r\nby Lincoln. On April 1 he drafted that astonishing document entitled,\r\n\"Some Thoughts for the President's Consideration,\" which at once reveals\r\nhis alarm and his supreme personal self-confidence. This document\r\nbegins, \"We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without\r\na policy either domestic or foreign.\" It then advocates as a domestic\r\npolicy, \"_Change The Question Before The Public From One Upon Slavery,\r\nOr About Slavery_, for a question upon _Union or Disunion_.\" Then in a\r\nsecond section, headed \"For Foreign Nations,\" there followed:\r\n\r\n     \"I would demand explanations from Spain and France,\r\n     categorically, at once.\r\n\r\n     \"I would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia, and\r\n     send agents into Canada, Mexico and Central America to rouse\r\n     a vigorous continental spirit of independence on this\r\n     continent against European intervention.\r\n\r\n     \"And, if satisfactory explanations are not received from\r\n     Spain and France.\r\n\r\n     \"Would convene Congress and declare war against them.\r\n\r\n     \"But whatever policy we adopt, there must be energetic\r\n     prosecution of it.\r\n\r\n     \"For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue\r\n     and direct it incessantly.\r\n\r\n     \"Either the President must do it himself, and be all the\r\n     while active in it, or\r\n\r\n     \"Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted,\r\n     debates on it must end, and all agree and abide.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not in my especial province;\r\n\r\n     \"But I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility[202].\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's reply of the same day, April 1, was characteristically gentle,\r\nyet no less positive and definite to any save one obsessed with his own\r\nsuperior wisdom. Lincoln merely noted that Seward's \"domestic policy\"\r\nwas exactly his own, except that he did not intend to abandon Fort\r\nSumter. As to the warlike foreign policy Lincoln pointed out that this\r\nwould be a sharp reversal of that already being prepared in circulars\r\nand instructions to Ministers abroad. This was, indeed, the case, for\r\nthe first instructions, soon despatched, were drawn on lines of\r\nrecalling to foreign powers their established and long-continued\r\nfriendly relations with the United States. Finally, Lincoln stated as\r\nto the required \"guiding hand,\" \"I remark that if this must be done, I\r\nmust do it.... I wish, and suppose I am entitled to have, the advice of\r\nall the Cabinet[203].\"\r\n\r\nThis should have been clear indication of Lincoln's will to direct\r\naffairs, and even to Seward would have been sufficient had he not,\r\nmomentarily, been so disturbed by the wreck of his pacific policy toward\r\nthe South, and as yet so ignorant of the strength of Lincoln's quiet\r\npersistence. As it was, he yielded on the immediate issue, the relief of\r\nSumter (though attempting to divert reinforcements to another quarter)\r\nbut did not as yet wholly yield either his policy of conciliation and\r\ndelay, nor give up immediately his insane scheme of saving the Union by\r\nplunging it into a foreign war. He was, in fact, still giving assurances\r\nto the Confederate commissioners, through indirect channels, that he\r\ncould and would prevent the outbreak of civil war, and in this\r\nconfidence that his ideas would finally control Lincoln he remained up\r\nto the second week in April. But on April 8 the first of the ships\r\ndespatched to the aid of Sumter left New York, and on that day Governor\r\nPickens of South Carolina was officially notified of the Northern\r\npurpose. This threw the burden of striking the first blow upon the\r\nSouth; if Southern threats were now made good, civil war seemed\r\ninevitable, and there could be no peaceful decision of the quarrel.\r\n\r\nThe reinforcements did not arrive in time. Fort Sumter, after a day and\r\na half of dogged fighting, was surrendered to the enemy on April 13--for\r\nas an enemy in arms the South now stood. The fall of Sumter changed, as\r\nin a moment, the whole attitude of the Northern people. There was now a\r\nnearly unanimous cry for the preservation of the Union _by force_. Yet\r\nSeward still clung, privately, to his belief that even now the \"sober\r\nsecond thought\" of the South would offer a way out toward reunion\r\nwithout war. In official utterances and acts he was apparently in\r\ncomplete harmony with the popular will to reconquer the South. Davis'\r\nproclamation on marque and privateering, of April 17, was answered by\r\nthe Lincoln blockade proclamation of April 19. But Virginia had not yet\r\nofficially seceded, and until this occurred there seemed to Seward at\r\nleast one last straw of conciliation available. In this situation\r\nSchleiden, Minister for Bremen, came to Seward on the morning of April\r\n24 and offered his services as a mediator[204].\r\n\r\nSchleiden's idea was that an armistice be agreed upon with the South\r\nuntil the Northern Congress should meet in July, thus giving a breathing\r\nspell and permitting saner second judgment to both sides. He had\r\nconsulted with his Prussian colleague, who approved, and he found Seward\r\nfavourable to the plan. Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the\r\nConfederacy, was then at Richmond, and to him, as an old friend,\r\nSchleiden proposed to go and make the same appeal. Seward at once took\r\nSchleiden to see Lincoln. The three men, with Chase (and the Prussian\r\nMinister) were the only ones in the secret. Lincoln's first comment was\r\nthat he was \"willing to make an attempt of contributing to the\r\nprevention of bloodshed and regretted that Schleiden had not gone to\r\nRichmond without consulting him or Seward.\" Lincoln further stated that\r\n\"he did not have in mind any aggression against the Southern States, but\r\nmerely the safety of the Government in the Capitol and the possibility\r\nto govern everywhere,\" a concluding phrase that should have enlightened\r\nSchleiden as to Lincoln's determination to preserve the Union. Lincoln\r\nsaid he could neither authorize negotiations nor invite proposals, but\r\nthat he would gladly consider any such proposals voluntarily made.\r\nSchleiden asked for a definite statement as to whether Lincoln would\r\nrecall the blockade proclamation and sign an armistice if Davis would\r\nrecall the letters of marque proclamation, but Lincoln refused to\r\ncommit himself.\r\n\r\nThis was scant encouragement from the President, but Seward still\r\nthought something might result from the venture, and on that evening,\r\nApril 24, Schleiden started for Richmond, being provided by Seward with\r\na pass through the Union lines. He arrived on the afternoon of the\r\ntwenty-fifth, but even before reaching the city was convinced that his\r\nmission would be a failure. All along his journey, at each little\r\nstation, he saw excited crowds assembled enthusiastic for secession,\r\nbands of militia training, and every indication of preparation for war.\r\nAlready, on that same day, the Virginia secession ordinance had been\r\npublished, and the State convention had ratified the provisional\r\nconstitution of the Southern Confederacy. Schleiden immediately notified\r\nStephens of his presence in Richmond and desire for an interview, and\r\nwas at once received. The talk lasted three hours. Stephens was frank\r\nand positive in asserting the belief that \"all attempts to settle\r\npeacefully the differences between the two sections were futile.\" Formal\r\nletters were exchanged after this conference, but in these the extent to\r\nwhich Stephens would go was to promise to use his influence in favour of\r\ngiving consideration to any indication made by the North of a desire\r\n\"for an amicable adjustment of the questions at issue,\" and he was\r\npositive that there could be no return of the South to the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of April 27 Schleiden was back in Washington. He found\r\nthat three days had made a great change in the sentiment of the Capitol.\r\n\"During my short absence,\" he wrote, \"many thousands of volunteers had\r\narrived from the North. There was not only a feeling of security\r\nnoticeable, but even of combativeness.\" He found Seward not at all\r\ndisposed to pursue the matter, and was not given an opportunity to talk\r\nto Lincoln; therefore, he merely submitted copies of the letters that\r\nhad passed between him and Stephens, adding for himself that the South\r\nwas arming _because_ of Lincoln's proclamation calling for volunteers.\r\nSeward replied on April 29, stating his personal regards and that he had\r\nno fault to find with Schleiden's efforts, but concluding that Stephens'\r\nletters gave no ground for action since the \"Union of these States is\r\nthe supreme as it is the organic law of this country,\" and must be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThis adventure to Richmond by the Minister of Bremen may be regarded as\r\nSeward's last struggle to carry out his long-pursued policy of\r\nconciliatory delay. He had not officially sent Schleiden to Richmond,\r\nbut he had grasped eagerly at the opening and had encouraged and aided\r\nSchleiden in his journey. Now, by April 27, hope had vanished, and\r\nSeward's \"domestic policy,\" as set forth in his \"Thoughts for the\r\nPresident's Consideration\" on April 1, was discredited, and inevitably,\r\nin some measure, their author also. The dates are important in\r\nappreciating Seward's purposes. On April 27, the day of Schleiden's\r\nreturn to Washington, there was sent to Adams that \"sharp\" despatch,\r\ntaking issue with British action as foreshadowed by Dallas on April 9,\r\nand concluding by instructing Adams to lose no time in warning Russell\r\nthat such action would be regarded by the United States as \"injurious to\r\nits rights and derogating from its dignity[205].\" It appears, therefore,\r\nthat Seward, defeated on one line of \"policy,\" eager to regain prestige,\r\nand still obsessed with the idea that some means could yet be found to\r\navert domestic conflict, was, on April 27, beginning to pick at those\r\nthreads which, to his excited thought, might yet save the Union through\r\na foreign war. He was now seeking to force the acceptance of the second,\r\nand alternative, portion of his \"Thoughts for the President.\"\r\n\r\nSeward's theory of the cementing effect of a foreign war was no secret\r\nat Washington. As early as January 26 he had unfolded to Schleiden this\r\nfantastic plan. \"If the Lord would only give the United States an excuse\r\nfor a war with England, France, or Spain,\" he said \"that would be the\r\nbest means of re-establishing internal peace[206].\" Again, on February\r\n10, he conversed with Schleiden on the same topic, and complained that\r\nthere was no foreign complication offering an excuse for a break. Lyons\r\nknew of this attitude, and by February 4 had sent Russell a warning, to\r\nwhich the latter had replied on February 20 that England could afford to\r\nbe patient for a time but that too much \"blustering demonstration\" must\r\nnot be indulged in. But the new administration, as Lincoln had remarked\r\nin his reply to Seward on April 1, had taken quite another line,\r\naddressing foreign powers in terms of high regard for established\r\nfriendly relations. This was the tone of Seward's first instruction to\r\nAdams, April 10[207], in the concluding paragraph of which Seward wrote,\r\n\"The United States are not indifferent to the circumstances of common\r\ndescent, language, customs, sentiments, and religion, which recommend a\r\ncloser sympathy between themselves and Great Britain than either might\r\nexpect in its intercourse with any other nation.\" True, on this basis,\r\nSeward claimed a special sympathy from Great Britain for the United\r\nStates, that is to say, the North, but most certainly the tone of this\r\nfirst instruction was one of established friendship.\r\n\r\nYet now, April 27, merely on learning from Dallas that Russell \"refuses\r\nto pledge himself\" on British policy, Seward resorts to threats. What\r\nother explanation is possible except that, seeking to save his domestic\r\npolicy of conciliation and to regain his leadership, he now was\r\nadventuring toward the application of his \"foreign war panacea\" idea.\r\nLyons quickly learned of the changed tone, and that England, especially,\r\nwas to hear American complaint. On May 2 Lyons wrote to Russell in\r\ncypher characterizing Seward as \"arrogant and reckless toward Foreign\r\nPowers[208].\" Evidently Seward was making little concealment of his\r\nbelligerent attitude, and when the news was received of the speeches in\r\nParliament of the first week in May by which it became clear that Great\r\nBritain would declare neutrality and was planning joint action with\r\nFrance, he became much excited. On May 17 he wrote a letter home\r\nexhibiting, still, an extraordinary faith in his own wisdom and his own\r\nforeign policy.\r\n\r\n     \"A country so largely relying on my poor efforts to save it\r\n     had [has] refused me the full measure of its confidence,\r\n     needful to that end. I am a chief reduced to a subordinate\r\n     position, and surrounded by a guard, to see that I do not do\r\n     too much for my country, lest some advantage may revert\r\n     indirectly to my own fame.\r\n\r\n     \"... They have misunderstood things fearfully, in Europe,\r\n     Great Britain is in danger of sympathizing so much with the\r\n     South, for the sake of peace and cotton, as to drive us to\r\n     make war against her, as the ally of the traitors.... I am\r\n     trying to get a bold remonstrance through the Cabinet before\r\n     it is too late[209].\"\r\n\r\nThe \"bold remonstrance\" was the famous \"Despatch No. 10,\" of May 21,\r\nalready commented upon in the preceding chapter. But as sent to Adams\r\nit varied in very important details from the draft submitted by Seward\r\nto Lincoln[210].\r\n\r\nSeward's draft was not merely a \"remonstrance\"; it was a challenge. Its\r\nlanguage implied that the United States desired war, and Seward's plan\r\nwas to have Adams read the despatch to Russell, give him a copy of it,\r\nand then discontinue diplomatic relations so long as Russell held either\r\nofficial or unofficial intercourse with the Southern Commissioners. This\r\nlast instruction was, indeed, retained in the final form of the\r\ndespatch, but here, as elsewhere, Lincoln modified the stiff expressions\r\nof the original. Most important of all, he directed Adams to consider\r\nthe whole despatch as for his own guidance, relying on his discretion.\r\nThe despatch, as amended, began with the statement that the United\r\nStates \"neither means to menace Great Britain nor to wound the\r\nsensibilities of that or any other European nation.... The paper itself\r\nis not to be read or shown to the British Secretary of State, nor any of\r\nits positions to be prematurely, unnecessarily, or indiscreetly made\r\nknown. But its spirit will be your guide[211].\" Thus were the teeth\r\nskilfully drawn from the threat of war. Even the positive instructions,\r\nlater in the despatch, as to the Southern Commissioners, need not have\r\nbeen acted upon by Adams had he not thought it wise to do so. But even\r\nwith alterations, the American remonstrance was so bold as to alarm\r\nAdams. On first perusual he wrote in his diary, June 10, \"The Government\r\nseems almost ready to declare war with all the powers of Europe, and\r\nalmost instructs me to withdraw from communication with the Ministers\r\nhere in a certain contingency.... I scarcely know how to understand Mr.\r\nSeward. The rest of the Government may be demented for all I know; but\r\nhe surely is calm and wise. My duty here is in so far as I can do it\r\nhonestly to prevent the irritation from coming to a downright quarrel.\r\nIt seems to me like throwing the game into the hands of the enemy[212].\"\r\n\r\nAdams, a sincere admirer of Seward, was in error as to the source of\r\nAmerican belligerent attitude. Fortunately, his judgment of what was\r\nwise at the moment coincided with that of Lincoln's--though of this he\r\nhad no knowledge. In the event Adams' skilful handling of the situation\r\nresulted favourably--even to the cessation of intercourse between\r\nRussell and the Southern Commissioners. For his part, Lincoln, no more\r\nthan earlier, was to be hurried into foreign complications, and Seward's\r\n\"foreign war panacea\" was stillborn.\r\n\r\nThe incident was a vital one in the Northern administration, for Seward\r\nat last realized that the President intended to control policy, and\r\nthough it was yet long before he came to appreciate fully Lincoln's\r\ncustomary calm judgment, he did understand the relation now established\r\nbetween himself and his chief. Henceforth, he obeyed orders, though\r\nfree in suggestion and criticism, always welcome to Lincoln. The latter,\r\navowedly ignorant of diplomacy, gladly left details to Seward, and the\r\naltered despatch, far from making relations difficult, rendered them\r\nsimple and easy, by clearing the atmosphere. But it was otherwise with\r\nForeign Ministers at Washington, for even though there was soon a \"leak\"\r\nof gossip informing them of what had taken place in regard to Despatch\r\nNo. 10, they one and all were fearful of a recovery of influence by\r\nSeward and of a resumption of belligerent policy. This was particularly\r\ntrue of Lord Lyons, for rumour had it that it was against England that\r\nSeward most directed his enmity. There resulted for British diplomats\r\nboth at Washington and in London a deep-seated suspicion of Seward, long\r\nafter he had made a complete face-about in policy. This suspicion\r\ninfluenced relations greatly in the earlier years of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, the day before Seward's No. 10 was dated, Lyons wrote a long\r\ntwelve-page despatch to Russell, anxious, and very full of Seward's\r\nwarlike projects. \"The President is, of course, wholly ignorant of\r\nforeign countries, and of foreign affairs.\" \"Seward, having lost\r\nstrength by the failure of his peace policy, is seeking to recover\r\ninfluence by leading a foreign war party; no one in the Cabinet is\r\nstrong enough to combat him.\" Britain, Lyons thought, should maintain a\r\nstiff attitude, prepare to defend Canada, and make close contacts with\r\nFrance. He was evidently anxious to impress upon Russell that Seward\r\nreally might mean war, but he declared the chief danger to lie in the\r\nfact of American belief that England and France could not be driven into\r\nwar with the United States, and that they would submit to any insult.\r\nLyons urged some action, or declaration (he did not know what), to\r\ncorrect this false impression[213]. Again, on the next day, May 21, the\r\ninformation in his official despatch was repeated in a private letter to\r\nRussell, but Lyons here interprets Seward's threats as mere bluster. Yet\r\nhe is not absolutely sure of this, and in any case insists that the best\r\npreventative of war with the United States is to show that England is\r\nready for it[214].\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious time for the British Minister in Washington. May 22,\r\nhe warned Sir Edmund Head, Governor of Canada, urging him to make\r\ndefensive preparation[215]. The following day he dilated to Russell,\r\nprivately, on \"the difficulty of keeping Mr. Seward within the bounds of\r\ndecency even in ordinary social intercourse[216] ...\" and in an official\r\ncommunication of this same day he records Washington rumours of a\r\nbelligerent despatch read by Seward before the Cabinet, of objections by\r\nother members, and that Seward's insistence has carried the day[217].\r\nThat Seward was, in fact, still smarting over his reverse is shown by a\r\nletter, written on this same May 23, to his intimate friend and\r\npolitical adviser, Thurlow Weed, who had evidently cautioned him against\r\nprecipitate action. Seward wrote, \"The European phase is bad. But your\r\napprehension that I may be too decisive alarms me more. Will you\r\nconsent, or advise us to consent, that Adams and Dayton have audiences\r\nand compliments in the Ministers' Audience Chamber, and Toombs'\r\n[Confederate Secretary of State] emissaries have access to his\r\nbedroom[218]?\"\r\n\r\nTwo interpretations are possible from this: either that Seward knowing\r\nhimself defeated was bitter in retrospect, or that he had not yet\r\nyielded his will to that of Lincoln, in spite of the changes made in his\r\nDespatch No. 10. The former interpretation seems the more likely, for\r\nthough Seward continued to write for a time \"vigorous\" despatches to\r\nAdams, they none of them approached the vigour of even the amended\r\ndespatch. Moreover, the exact facts of the Cabinet of May 21, and the\r\ncomplete reversal of Seward's policy were sufficiently known by May 24\r\nto have reached the ears of Schleiden, who reported them in a letter to\r\nBremen of that date[219]. And on the same day Seward himself told\r\nSchleiden that he did \"not fear any longer that it would come to a break\r\nwith England[220].\" On May 27 Lyons himself, though still suspicious\r\nthat an attempt was being made to separate France and England, was able\r\nto report a better tone from Seward[221].\r\n\r\nBritish Ministers in London were not so alarmed as was Lyons, but they\r\nwere disturbed, nevertheless, and long preserved a suspicion of the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State. May 23, Palmerston wrote to Russell in\r\ncomment on Lyons' despatch of May 2: \"These communications are very\r\nunpleasant. It is not at all unlikely that either from foolish and\r\nuncalculating arrogance and self-sufficiency or from political\r\ncalculation Mr. Seward may bring on a quarrel with us[222].\" He believed\r\nthat more troops ought to be sent to Canada, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, but, he added, \"the main Force for Defence must, of course, be\r\nlocal\"--a situation necessarily a cause for anxiety by British\r\nMinisters. Russell was less perturbed. He had previously expressed\r\nappreciation of Adams' conduct, writing to Lyons: \"Mr. Adams has made a\r\nvery favourable impression on my mind as a calm and judicious man[223],\"\r\nand he now wrote: \"I do not think Mr. Seward's colleagues will encourage\r\nhim in a game of brag with England.... I am sorry Seward turns out so\r\nreckless and ruthless. Adams seems a sensible man[224].\" But at\r\nWashington Lyons was again hot on the trail of warlike rumours. As a\r\nresult of a series of conversations with Northern politicians, not\r\nCabinet members, he sent a cipher telegram to Russell on June 6,\r\nstating: \"No new event has occurred but sudden declaration of war by the\r\nUnited States against Great Britain appears to me by no means\r\nimpossible, especially so long as Canada seems open to invasion[225].\"\r\nThis was followed two days later by a despatch dilating upon the\r\nprobability of war, and ending with Lyons' opinion of how it should be\r\nconducted. England should strike at once with the largest possible naval\r\nforce and bring the war to an end before the United States could\r\nprepare. Otherwise, \"the spirit, the energy, and the resources of this\r\npeople\" would make them difficult to overcome. England, on her part,\r\nmust be prepared to suffer severely from American privateers, and she\r\nwould be forced to help the South, at least to the extent of keeping\r\nSouthern ports open. Finally, Lyons concluded, all of this letter and\r\nadvice were extremely distasteful to him, yet he felt compelled to write\r\nit by the seriousness of the situation. Nevertheless, he would exert\r\nevery effort and use every method to conciliate America[226].\r\n\r\nIn truth, it was not any further belligerent talk by Seward that had so\r\nrenewed Lyons' anxiety. Rather it was the public and Press reception of\r\nthe news of the Queen's Proclamation of Neutrality. The Northern people,\r\ncounting beyond all reasonable expectation upon British sympathy on\r\nanti-slavery grounds, had been angrily disappointed, and were at the\r\nmoment loudly voicing their vexation. Had Seward not already been turned\r\nfrom his foreign war policy he now would have received strong public\r\nsupport in it. But he made no effort to utilize public excitement to his\r\nown advantage in the Cabinet. In England, Adams was able to report on\r\nJune 14 that Russell had no intention of holding further interviews with\r\nthe Southern Commissioners[227], but before anyone in Washington could\r\nlearn of this there was general knowledge of a changed tone from the\r\nSecretary of State, and Lyons' fears were considerably allayed. On June\r\n15, occurred that interview between Seward, Lyons, and Mercier, in which\r\nSeward had positively refused to receive the Queen's Proclamation, but\r\nhad throughout evinced the greatest courtesy and goodwill. Lyons so\r\nreported the conversation[228]. June 15 may, in fact, be taken as the\r\ndate when Lyons ceased to be alarmed over an immediate war. Possibly he\r\nfound it a little difficult to report so sudden a shift from stormy to\r\nfair weather. June 21, he wrote that the \"lull\" was still\r\ncontinuing[229]. June 24, he at last learned and described at length the\r\ndetails of Lincoln's alteration of Despatch No. 10[230]. He did not\r\nknow the exact date but he expressed the opinion that \"a month or three\r\nweeks ago\" war was very near--a misjudgment, since it should be\r\nremembered that war seemed advisable to one man only--Seward; and that\r\non this issue he had been definitely cast down from his self-assumed\r\nleadership into the ranks of Lincoln's lieutenants.\r\n\r\nLyons was, then, nearly a month behindhand in exact knowledge of\r\nAmerican foreign policy toward England, and he was in error in thinking\r\nthat an American attack on England was either imminent or intended.\r\nNevertheless, he surely was excusable, considering Seward's prestige and\r\nLincoln's lack of it, in reporting as he did. It was long, indeed,\r\nbefore he could escape from suspicion of Seward's purposes, though\r\ndropping, abruptly, further comment on the chances of war. A month\r\nlater, on July 20, he wrote that Seward had himself asked for a\r\nconfidential and unofficial interview, in order to make clear that there\r\nnever had been any intention of stirring agitation against England.\r\nPersonally, Seward took credit for avoiding trouble \"by refusing to take\r\nofficial cognizance of the recognition [by England] of the belligerent\r\nrights of the South,\" and he asked Lyons to explain to Russell that\r\nprevious strong language was intended merely to make foreign Powers\r\nunderstand the intensity of Northern feeling[231].\r\n\r\nLyons put no faith in all this but was happy to note the change,\r\nmistakenly attributing it to England's \"stiff tone,\" and not at all to\r\nthe veto of the President. Since Lyons himself had gone to the utmost\r\nbounds in seeking conciliation (so he had reported), and, in London,\r\nRussell also had taken no forward step since the issue of the Queen's\r\nProclamation--indeed, had rather yielded somewhat to Adams'\r\nrepresentations--it is not clear in what the \"stiff tone\" consisted.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the cause of Seward's explanation to Lyons was the receipt of a\r\ndespatch from Adams, dated June 28, in which the latter had reported\r\nthat all was now smooth sailing. He had told Russell that the knowledge\r\nin Washington of the result of their previous interviews had brought\r\nsatisfaction, and Russell, for his part, said that Lyons had \"learned,\r\nthrough another member of the diplomatic corps, that no further\r\nexpression of opinion on the subject in question would be\r\nnecessary[232].\" This referred, presumably, to the question of British\r\nintention, for the future, in relation to the Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality. Adams wrote: \"This led to the most frank and pleasant\r\nconversation which I have yet had with his lordship.... I added that I\r\nbelieved the popular feeling in the United States would subside the\r\nmoment that all the later action on this side was known.... My own\r\nreception has been all that I could desire. I attach value to this,\r\nhowever, only as it indicates the establishment of a policy that will\r\nkeep us at peace during the continuance of the present convulsion.\" In\r\nreply to Adams' despatch, Seward wrote on July 21, the day after his\r\ninterview with Lyons, arguing at great length the American view that the\r\nBritish Proclamation of Neutrality in a domestic quarrel was not\r\ndefensible in international law. There was not now, nor later, any\r\nyielding on this point. But, for the present, this was intended for\r\nAdams' eye alone, and Seward prefaced his argument by a disclaimer, much\r\nas stated to Lyons, of any ill-will to Great Britain:\r\n\r\n     \"I may add, also, for myself, that however otherwise I may at\r\n     any time have been understood, it has been an earnest and\r\n     profound solicitude to avert from foreign war; that alone has\r\n     prompted the emphatic and sometimes, perhaps, impassioned\r\n     remonstrances I have hitherto made against any form or\r\n     measure of recognition of the insurgents by the government of\r\n     Great Britain. I write in the same spirit now; and I invoke\r\n     on the part of the British government, as I propose to\r\n     exercise on my own, the calmness which all counsellors ought\r\n     to practise in debates which involve the peace and happiness\r\n     of mankind[233].\"\r\n\r\nDiplomatic correspondence couched in the form of platform oratory leads\r\nto the suspicion that the writer is thinking, primarily, of the ultimate\r\npublication of his despatches. Thus Seward seems to have been laying the\r\nground for a denial that he had ever developed a foolish foreign war\r\npolicy. History pins him to that folly. But in another respect the\r\ninterview with Lyons on July 20 and the letter to Adams of the day\r\nfollowing overthrow for both Seward and for the United States the\r\naccusations sometimes made that it was the Northern disaster at Bull\r\nRun, July 21, in the first pitched battle with the South, which made\r\nmore temperate the Northern tone toward foreign powers[234]. It is true\r\nthat the despatch to Adams was not actually sent until July 26, but\r\ninternal evidence shows it to have been written on the 21st before there\r\nwas any news from the battle-field, and the interview with Lyons on the\r\n20th proves that the military set-back had no influence on Seward's\r\nfriendly expressions. Moreover, these expressions officially made were\r\nbut a delayed voicing of a determination of policy arrived at many weeks\r\nearlier. The chronology of events and despatches cited in this chapter\r\nwill have shown that the refusal of Lincoln to follow Seward's\r\nleadership, and the consequent lessening of the latter's \"high tone,\"\r\npreceded any news whatever from England, lightening the first\r\nimpressions. The Administration at Washington did not on May 21, even\r\nknow that England had issued a Proclamation of Neutrality; it knew\r\nmerely of Russell's statement that one would have to be issued; and the\r\nfriendly explanations of Russell to Adams were not received in\r\nWashington until the month following.\r\n\r\nIn itself, Seward's \"foreign war panacea\" policy does not deserve the\r\nplace in history usually accorded it as a moment of extreme crisis in\r\nBritish-American relations. There was never any danger of war from it,\r\nfor Lincoln nipped the policy in the bud. The public excitement in\r\nAmerica over the Queen's Proclamation was, indeed, intense; but this did\r\nnot alter the Governmental attitude. In England all that the public knew\r\nwas this American irritation and clamour. The London press expressed\r\nitself a bit more cautiously, for the moment, merely defending the\r\nnecessity of British neutrality[235]. But if regarded from the effect\r\nupon British Ministers the incident was one of great, possibly even\r\nvital, importance in the relations of the two countries. Lyons had been\r\ngravely anxious to the point of alarm. Russell, less acutely alarmed,\r\nwas yet seriously disturbed. Both at Washington and in London the\r\nsuspicion of Seward lasted throughout the earlier years of the war, and\r\nto British Ministers it seemed that at any moment he might recover\r\nleadership and revert to a dangerous mood. British attitude toward\r\nAmerica was affected in two opposite ways; Britain was determined not to\r\nbe bullied, and Russell himself sometimes went to the point of arrogance\r\nin answer to American complaints; this was an unfortunate result. But\r\nmore fortunate, and _also a result_, was the British Government's\r\ndetermination to step warily in the American conflict and to give no\r\njust cause, unless on due consideration of policy, for a rupture of\r\nrelations with the United States. Seward's folly in May of 1861, from\r\nevery angle but a short-lived \"brain-storm,\" served America well in the\r\nfirst years of her great crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: See _ante_, p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Barnes, _Life of Thurlow Weed_, II, p. 378.

And the United States was surely too proud to\r\naccept direct British aid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DECLARATION OF PARIS NEGOTIATION\r\n\r\nIf regarded merely from the view-point of strict chronology there\r\naccompanied Seward's \"foreign war\" policy a negotiation with Great\r\nBritain which was of importance as the first effort of the American\r\nSecretary of State to bring European nations to a definite support of\r\nthe Northern cause. It was also the first negotiation undertaken by\r\nAdams in London, and as a man new to the diplomatic service he attached\r\nto it an unusual importance, even, seemingly, to the extent of\r\npermitting personal chagrin at the ultimate failure of the negotiation\r\nto distort his usually cool and fair judgment. The matter in question\r\nwas the offer of the United States to accede by a convention to the\r\nDeclaration of Paris of 1856, establishing certain international rules\r\nfor the conduct of maritime warfare.\r\n\r\nThis negotiation has received scant attention in history. It failed to\r\nresult in a treaty, therefore it has appeared to be negligible. Yet it\r\nwas at the time of very great importance in affecting the attitude\r\ntoward each other of Great Britain and the United States, and of the men\r\nwho spoke for their respective countries. The bald facts of the\r\nnegotiation appear with exactness in Moore's _Digest of International\r\nLaw_[236], but without comment as to motives, and, more briefly, in\r\nBernard's _Neutrality of Great Britain during the American Civil\r\nWar_[237], at the conclusion of which the author writes, with sarcasm,\r\n\"I refrain from any comment on this negotiation[238].\" Nicolay and Hay's\r\n_Lincoln_, and Rhodes' _United States_, give the matter but passing and\r\ninadequate treatment. It was reviewed in some detail in the American\r\nargument before the Geneva court of arbitration in the case of the\r\n_Alabama_, but was there presented merely as a part of the general\r\nAmerican complaint of British neutrality. In fact, but three historical\r\nstudents, so far as the present writer has been able to discover, have\r\nexamined this negotiation in detail and presented their conclusions as\r\nto purposes and motives--so important to an understanding of British\r\nintentions at the moment when the flames of civil war were rapidly\r\nspreading in America.\r\n\r\nThese three, each with an established historical reputation, exhibit\r\ndecided differences in interpretation of diplomatic incidents and\r\ndocuments. The first careful analysis was presented by Henry Adams, son\r\nof the American Minister in London during the Civil War, and then acting\r\nas his private secretary, in his _Historical Essays_, published in 1891;\r\nthe second study is by Bancroft, in his _Life of Seward_, 1900; while\r\nthe third is by Charles Francis Adams (also son of the American\r\nMinister), who, in his _Life_ of his father, published 1900, gave a\r\nchapter to the subject and treated it on lines similar to those laid\r\ndown by his brother Henry, but who, in 1912, came to the conclusion,\r\nthrough further study, that he had earlier been in error and developed a\r\nvery different view in a monograph entitled, \"Seward and the Declaration\r\nof Paris.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C.F. ADAMS (_From a photograph in the United States\r\nEmbassy, London, by kind permission_)]\r\n\r\nIf these historiographic details seem unduly minute, partaking as they\r\ndo of the nature of a foot-note, in a work otherwise general in\r\ntreatment, the author's answer is that the personality of two of the\r\nwriters mentioned and their intimate knowledge of the effect of the\r\nnegotiation upon the mind of the American Minister in London are\r\nthemselves important historical data; a further answer is the fact\r\nthat the materials now available from the British Foreign Office\r\narchives throw much new light both on the course of the negotiation and\r\non British purposes. It is here planned, therefore, first to review the\r\nmain facts as previously known; second, to summarize the arguments and\r\nconclusions of the three historians; third, to re-examine the\r\nnegotiation in the light of the new material; and, finally, to express\r\nan opinion on its conduct and conclusions as an evidence of\r\nBritish policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, during the Crimean War, Great Britain and France, the chief\r\nmaritime belligerents engaged against Russia, voluntarily agreed to\r\nrespect neutral commerce under either the neutral's or the enemy's flag.\r\nThis was a distinct step forward in the practice of maritime warfare,\r\nthe accepted international rules of which had not been formally altered\r\nsince the Napoleonic period. The action of Great Britain was due in\r\npart, according to a later statement in Parliament by Palmerston, March\r\n18, 1862, to a fear that unless a greater respect were paid than\r\nformerly to neutral rights, the Allies would quickly win the ill-will of\r\nthe United States, then the most powerful maritime neutral, and would\r\nrun the danger of forcing that country into belligerent alliance with\r\nRussia[239]. No doubt there were other reasons, also, for the barbarous\r\nrules and practices of maritime warfare in earlier times were by now\r\nregarded as semi-civilized by the writers of all nations. Certainly the\r\naction of the belligerents in 1854 met with general approval and in the\r\nresult was written into international law at the Congress of Paris in\r\n1856, where, at the conclusion of the war, the belligerents and some\r\nleading neutrals were gathered.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Paris on maritime warfare covered four points:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Privateering is, and remains, abolished.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception\r\n     of contraband of war.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war,\r\n     are not liable to capture under enemy's flag.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective;\r\n     that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to\r\n     prevent access to the coast of the enemy[240].\"\r\n\r\nThis agreement was adopted by Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia,\r\nRussia, Sardinia and Turkey, and it was further agreed that a general\r\ninvitation to accede should be extended to all nations, but with the\r\nproviso \"that the powers which shall have signed it, or which shall\r\naccede thereto, shall not in future enter into any arrangement,\r\nconcerning the application of the law of neutrals in time of war, which\r\ndoes not rest altogether upon the four principles embodied in the said\r\ndeclaration[241].\" In other words it must be accepted in whole, and not\r\nin part, and the powers acceding pledging themselves not to enter into\r\nany subsequent treaties or engagements on maritime law which did not\r\nstipulate observance of all four points. Within a short time nearly all\r\nthe maritime nations of the world had given official adherence to the\r\nDeclaration of Paris.\r\n\r\nBut the United States refused to do so. She had long stood in the\r\nadvance guard of nations demanding respect for neutral rights. Little by\r\nlittle her avowed principles of international law as regards neutrals,\r\nfirst scoffed at, had crept into acceptance in treaty stipulations.\r\nSecretary of State Marcy now declared, in July, 1856, that the United\r\nStates would accede to the Declaration if a fifth article were added to\r\nit protecting all private property at sea, when not contraband. This\r\ncovered not only cargo, but the vessel as well, and its effect would\r\nhave been to exclude from belligerent operations non-contraband enemy's\r\ngoods under the enemy's flag, if goods and ship were privately owned.\r\nMaritime warfare on the high seas would have been limited to battles\r\nbetween governmentally operated war-ships. Unless this rule were adopted\r\nalso, Secretary Marcy declared that \"the United States could not forgo\r\nthe right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most\r\neffective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no\r\nlarge navy, were essential to her fighting power.\"\r\n\r\n\"War on private property,\" said the Americans, \"had been abolished on\r\nland; why should it not be abolished also on the sea?\" The American\r\nproposal met with general support among the smaller maritime nations. It\r\nwas believed that the one great obstacle to the adoption of Marcy's\r\namendment lay in the naval supremacy of Great Britain, and that obstacle\r\nproved insurmountable. Thus the United States refused to accede to the\r\nDeclaration, and there the matter rested until 1861. But on April 17\r\nJefferson Davis proclaimed for the Southern Confederacy the issue of\r\nprivateers against Northern commerce. On April 24 Seward instructed\r\nrepresentatives abroad, recounting the Marcy proposal and expressing the\r\nhope that it still might meet with a favourable reception, but\r\nauthorizing them to enter into conventions for American adherence to the\r\nDeclaration of 1856 on the four points alone. This instruction was sent\r\nto the Ministers in Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, Austria,\r\nBelgium, Italy, and Denmark; and on May 10 to the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nHaving received this instruction, Adams, at the close of his first\r\nmeeting with Russell on May 18, after having developed at length the\r\nAmerican position relative to the issue of the British Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality, briefly added that he was directed to offer adherence by\r\nmeans of a convention, to the Declaration of Paris. Russell replied that\r\nGreat Britain was willing to negotiate, but \"seemed to desire to leave\r\nthe subject in the hands of Lord Lyons, to whom he intimated that he had\r\nalready transmitted authority[242]....\" Adams therefore did not press\r\nthe matter, waiting further information and instruction from Washington.\r\nNearly two weeks earlier Russell had, in fact, approached the Government\r\nof France with a suggestion that the two leading maritime powers should\r\npropose to the American belligerents adherence to the second and third\r\narticles of the Declaration of Paris. France had agreed and the date of\r\nRussell's instruction to Lyons was May 18, the day of the interview with\r\nAdams. Confusion now arose in both London and Washington as to the place\r\nwhere the arrangement was to be concluded. The causes of this confusion\r\nwill be considered later in this chapter; here it is sufficient to note\r\nthat the negotiation was finally undertaken at London.\r\n\r\nOn July 18 Russell informed Adams that Great Britain was ready to enter\r\ninto a convention with the United States, provided a similar convention\r\nwas signed with France at the same time. This convention, as submitted\r\nby Adams, simply recorded an agreement by the two powers to abide by the\r\nfour points of the Declaration of Paris, using the exact wording of that\r\ndocument[243]. Adams' draft had been communicated to Russell on July 13.\r\nThere then followed a delay required by the necessity of securing\r\nsimilar action by Dayton, the American Minister at Paris, but on July 29\r\nAdams reported to Russell that this had been done and that he was ready\r\nto sign. Two days later, July 31, Russell replied that he, also, was\r\nready, but concluded his letter, \"I need scarcely add that on the part\r\nof Great Britain the engagement will be prospective, and will not\r\ninvalidate anything already done[244].\" It was not until August 8,\r\nhowever, that Cowley, the British Ambassador to France, reported that\r\nDayton had informed Thouvenel, French Foreign Minister, that he was\r\nready to sign the similar convention with France[245]. With no\r\nunderstanding, apparently, of the causes of further delay, and\r\nprofessing complete ignorance of the meaning of Russell's phrase, just\r\nquoted[246], Adams waited the expected invitation to an official\r\ninterview for the affixing of signatures. Since it was a condition of\r\nthe negotiation that this should be done simultaneously in London and\r\nParis, the further delay that now occurred caused him no misgivings.\r\n\r\nOn August 19 Russell requested Adams to name a convenient day \"in the\r\ncourse of this week,\" and prefaced this request with the statement that\r\nhe enclosed a copy of a Declaration which he proposed to make in\r\nwriting, upon signing the convention. \"You will observe,\" he wrote,\r\n\"that it is intended to prevent any misconception as to the nature of\r\nthe engagement to be taken by Her Majesty.\" The proposed\r\nDeclaration read:\r\n\r\n     \"In affixing his signature to the Convention of this day\r\n     between Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland\r\n     and the United States of America, the Earl Russell declares,\r\n     by order of Her Majesty, that Her Majesty does not intend\r\n     thereby to undertake any engagement which shall have any\r\n     bearing, direct or indirect, on the internal differences now\r\n     prevailing in the United States[247].\"\r\n\r\nUnder his instructions to negotiate a convention for a pure and simple\r\nadherence to the Declaration of Paris, Adams could not now go on to\r\nofficial signature. Nor was he inclined to do so. Sincerely believing,\r\nas he stated to Russell in a communication of August 23, that the United\r\nStates was \"acting with the single purpose of aiding to establish a\r\npermanent doctrine for all time,\" and with the object of \"ameliorating\r\nthe horrors of warfare all over the globe,\" he objected \"to accompany\r\nthe act with a proceeding somewhat novel and anomalous,\" which on the\r\nface of it seemed to imply a suspicion on the part of Great Britain that\r\nthe United States was \"desirous at this time to take a part in the\r\nDeclaration [of Paris], not from any high purpose or durable policy, but\r\nwith the view of securing some small temporary object in the unhappy\r\nstruggle which is going on at home[248].\" He also pointed out that\r\nRussell's proposed declaration either was or was not a part of the\r\nconvention. If it was a part then the Senate of the United States must\r\nratify it as well as the convention itself, and he would have gone\r\nbeyond his instructions in submitting it. If not a part of the\r\nconvention there could be no advantage in making the Declaration since,\r\nunratified by the Senate, it would have no force. Adams therefore\r\ndeclined to proceed further with the matter until he had received new\r\ninstructions from Washington.\r\n\r\nTo this Russell answered, August 28, with a very explicit exposition of\r\nhis reasons. Great Britain, he said, had declared her neutrality in the\r\nAmerican conflict, thereby recognizing the belligerent rights of the\r\nSouth. It followed that the South \"might by the law of nations arm\r\nprivateers,\" and that these \"must be regarded as the armed vessels of a\r\nbelligerent.\" But the United States had refused to recognize the status\r\nof belligerency, and could therefore maintain that privateers issued by\r\nthe Southern States were in fact pirates, and might argue that a\r\nEuropean Power signing a convention with the United States, embodying\r\nthe principles of the Declaration of Paris, \"would be bound to treat the\r\nprivateers of the so-called Confederate States as pirates.\" Hence\r\nRussell pointed out, the two countries, arguing from contradictory\r\npremises as to the status of the conflict in America, might become\r\ninvolved in charges of bad faith and of violation of the convention. He\r\nhad therefore merely intended by his suggested declaration to prevent\r\nany misconception by the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"It is in this spirit that Her Majesty's Government decline\r\n     to bind themselves, without a clear explanation on their\r\n     part, to a Convention which, seemingly confined to an\r\n     adoption of the Declaration of Paris of 1856, might be\r\n     construed as an engagement to interfere in the unhappy\r\n     dissensions now prevailing in the United States; an\r\n     interference which would be contrary to Her Majesty's public\r\n     declarations, and would be a reversal of the policy which Her\r\n     Majesty has deliberately sanctioned[249].\"\r\n\r\nThus the negotiation closed. Seward in declining to accept the proposed\r\ndeclaration gave varying reasons in his instructions to Adams, in\r\nLondon, and to Dayton, in Paris, for an exactly similar declaration had\r\nbeen insisted upon by France, but he did not argue the question save in\r\ngeneralities. He told Dayton that the supposed possible \"intervention\"\r\nwhich Great Britain and France seemed to fear they would be called upon\r\nto make was exactly the action which the United States desired to\r\nforestall, and he notified Adams that he could not consent since the\r\nproposed Declaration \"would be virtually a new and distinct article\r\nincorporated into the projected convention[250].\" The first formal\r\nnegotiation of the United States during the Civil War, and of the new\r\nAmerican Minister in London, had come to an inglorious conclusion.\r\nDiplomats and Foreign Secretaries were, quite naturally, disturbed, and\r\nwere even suspicious of each others' motives, but the public, not at the\r\nmoment informed save on the American offer and the result, paid little\r\nattention to these \"inner circle\" controversies[251].\r\n\r\nWhat then were the hidden purposes, if such existed, of the negotiating\r\npowers. The first answer in historical writing was that offered by Henry\r\nAdams[252], in an essay entitled \"The Declaration of Paris, 1861,\" in\r\nthe preparation of which the author studied with care all the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence available in print[253]. His treatment presents Russell\r\nas engaged in a policy of deception with the view of obtaining an\r\nultimate advantage to Great Britain in the field of commercial rivalry\r\nand maritime supremacy. Following Henry Adams' argument Russell, on May\r\n9, brought to the attention of France a proposal for a joint request on\r\nthe American belligerents to respect the second and third articles of\r\nthe Declaration of Paris, and received an acquiescent reply. After some\r\nfurther exchanges of proposed terms of instructions to the British and\r\nFrench Ministers at Washington, Russell, on May 18, sent a despatch to\r\nLyons with instructions for his action. On this same day Russell, in his\r\nfirst interview with Adams, \"before these despatches [to Lyons] could\r\nhave left the Foreign Office,\" and replying to Adams' proposal to\r\nnegotiate on the Declaration of Paris as a _whole_--that is to say, on\r\nall four articles--intimated that instructions had already gone to\r\nLyons, with directions to assent to any modification of the article on\r\nprivateering that the United States might desire. Adams understood\r\nRussell to prefer that the negotiation (for such Adams thought it was to\r\nbe) should take place in Washington, and did not press the matter.\r\n\r\nThis was deliberate deceit; first in a statement of fact since the\r\ninterview with Adams took place at noon on May 18, at Russell's country\r\nhouse nine miles from London, and in all reasonable supposition the\r\ndespatch to Lyons would not have been sent until the Foreign Secretary's\r\nreturn to his office; second because Lyons was not instructed to\r\n_negotiate_ on the Declaration. The interpretation is justified\r\ntherefore that Russell \"evaded the offer of the United States\r\nGovernment.\" The result of this evasion was delay, but when Seward\r\nlearned from Lyons that he had no authority to negotiate a convention\r\nand Adams received renewed instructions to proceed, the latter \"kept his\r\ntemper, but the affair made a lasting impression on his mind, and shook\r\nhis faith in the straightforwardness of the British Government.\" In\r\nrenewing his overtures at London, Adams made explanations of the\r\nprevious \"misunderstanding\" and to these Russell replied with further\r\n\"inaccuracies\" as to what had been said at the first interview.\r\n\r\nThus beginning his survey with an assertion of British deceit and\r\nevasion from the very outset, and incidentally remarking that Lyons, at\r\nWashington, \"made little disguise of his leanings\" toward the South,\r\nHenry Adams depicts Russell as leading France along a line of policy\r\ndistinctly unfriendly to the North. Examining each point in the\r\nnegotiation as already narrated, he summarized it as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The story has shown that Russell and his colleagues ...\r\n     induced the French Government to violate the pledge in the\r\n     protocol of the Declaration of Paris in order to offer to\r\n     both belligerents a partial adhesion, which must exclude the\r\n     United States from a simple adhesion, to the Declaration of\r\n     Paris, while it placed both belligerents on the same apparent\r\n     footing. These steps were taken in haste before Adams could\r\n     obtain an interview. When Adams by an effort unexpected to\r\n     Russell obtained an interview at Pembroke Lodge at noon of\r\n     Saturday, May 18, and according to Russell's report of May\r\n     21, said that the United States were 'disposed to adhere to\r\n     the Declaration of Paris,' Russell evaded the offer, saying\r\n     that he had already sent sufficient instructions to Lyons,\r\n     although the instructions were not sufficient, nor had they\r\n     been sent. When this evasion was afterward brought to his\r\n     notice by Adams, Russell, revising his report to Lyons, made\r\n     such changes in it as should represent the first proposal as\r\n     coming from himself, and the evasion to have come from Adams.\r\n     When at last obliged to read the American offer, Russell\r\n     declared that he had never heard of it before, although he\r\n     had himself reported it to Lyons and Lyons had reported it to\r\n     him. When compelled to take the offer for consideration,\r\n     Russell, though always professing to welcome adhesion pure\r\n     and simple, required the co-operation of Dayton. When Adams\r\n     overcame this last obstacle, Russell interposed a written\r\n     proviso, which as he knew from Lyons would prevent\r\n     ratification. When Adams paid no attention to the proviso but\r\n     insisted on signature of the treaty, Russell at last wrote a\r\n     declaration in the nature of an insult, which could not be\r\n     disregarded[254].\"\r\n\r\nIn this presentation of the case to the jury certain minor points are\r\ninsisted upon to establish a ground for suspicion--as the question of\r\nwho first made the proposal--that are not essential to Henry Adams'\r\nconclusions. This conclusion is that \"From the delays interposed by\r\nRussell, Adams must conclude that the British Cabinet was trying one\r\ndevice after another to evade the proposition; and finally, from the\r\nwritten declaration of August 19, he could draw no other inference than\r\nthat Russell had resorted to the only defensive weapon left to him, in\r\norder to avoid the avowal of his true motives and policy[255].\" The\r\n_motive_ of this tortuous proceeding, the author believed to have been a\r\ndeep-laid scheme to revive, _after_ the American War was ended, the\r\nearlier international practice of Great Britain, in treating as subject\r\nto belligerent seizure enemy's goods under the neutral flag. It was the\r\nAmerican stand, argues Henry Adams, that in 1854 had compelled Great\r\nBritain to renounce this practice. A complete American adherence, now,\r\nto the Declaration, would for ever tie Britain's hands, but if there\r\nwere no such complete adherence and only temporary observation of the\r\nsecond article, after the war had resulted in the disruption of the\r\nUnited States, thus removing the chief supporter of that article, Great\r\nBritain would feel free to resume her old-time practice when she engaged\r\nin war. If Great Britain made a formal treaty with the United States she\r\nwould feel bound to respect it; the Declaration of Paris as it stood\r\nconstituted \"a mere agreement, which was binding, as Lord Malmesbury\r\ndeclared, only so long as it was convenient to respect it[256].\" Thus\r\nthe second article of the Declaration of Paris, not the first on\r\nprivateering, was in the eye of the British Cabinet in the negotiation\r\nof 1861. Henry Adams ends his essay: \"After the manner in which Russell\r\nreceived the advances of President Lincoln, no American Minister in\r\nLondon could safely act on any other assumption than that the British\r\nGovernment meant, at the first convenient opportunity, to revive the\r\nbelligerent pretensions dormant since the War of 1812[257].\"\r\n\r\nThis analysis was published in 1891. Still more briefly summarized it\r\ndepicts an unfriendly, almost hostile attitude on the part of Russell\r\nand Lyons, deceit and evasion by the former, selfish British policy, and\r\nthroughout a blind following on by France, yielding to Russell's\r\nleadership. The American proposal is regarded merely as a simple and\r\nsincere offer to join in supporting an improved international practice\r\nin war-times. But when Frederic Bancroft, the biographer of Seward,\r\nexamined the negotiation he was compelled to ask himself whether this\r\nwas all, indeed, that the American Secretary of State had in view.\r\nBancroft's analysis may be stated more briefly[258].\r\n\r\nSeward's general instruction, Bancroft notes, bore date of April 24,\r\nnearly a month before any foreign Power had recognized Southern\r\nbelligerent rights; it indicates \"a plan by which he hoped to remove all\r\nexcuse for such action.\" In despatches to Dayton, Seward asserted a\r\ntwofold motive: \"a sincere desire to co-operate with other progressive\r\nnations in the melioration of the rigours of maritime war,\" and \"to\r\nremove every cause that any foreign Power could have for the recognition\r\nof the insurgents as a belligerent Power[259].\" This last result was not\r\nso clear to Dayton at Paris, nor was the mechanism of operation ever\r\nopenly stated by Seward. But he did write, later, that the proposal of\r\naccession to the Declaration of Paris was tendered \"as the act of this\r\nFederal Government, to be obligatory equally upon disloyal as upon loyal\r\ncitizens.\" \"It did not,\" writes Bancroft, \"require the gift of prophecy\r\nto tell what would result in case the offer of accession on the part of\r\nthe United States should be accepted[260].\"\r\n\r\nSeward's object was to place the European nations in a position where\r\nthey, as well as the United States, would be forced to regard Southern\r\nprivateers as pirates, and treat them as such. This was a conceivable\r\nresult of the negotiation before European recognition of Southern\r\nbelligerency, but even after that recognition and after Dayton had\r\npointed out the impossibility of such a result, Seward pressed for the\r\ntreaty and instructed Dayton not to raise the question with France. He\r\nstill had in mind this main object. \"If Seward,\" says Bancroft, \"had not\r\nintended to use the adherence of the United States to the declaration as\r\na lever to force the other Powers to treat the Confederates as pirates,\r\nor at least to cease regarding them as belligerents, he might easily and\r\nunofficially have removed all such suspicions[261].\" In an interview\r\nwith Lyons on July 6 Seward urged a quick conclusion of the treaty,\r\narguing that its effect upon the revolted states could be determined\r\nafterwards. Naturally Lyons was alarmed and gave warning to Russell.\r\n\"Probably it was this advice that caused Russell to insist on the\r\nexplanatory declaration[262].\"\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that Seward much underestimated the acuteness of\r\nRussell and Thouvenel, and expected them \"to walk into a trap.\" Nor\r\ncould his claim \"that there was no difference between a nation entirely\r\nat peace and one in circumstances like those of the United States at\r\nthis time\" be taken seriously. \"He was furnishing his opponent with\r\nevidences of his lack of candour.\" This clouded the effect that would\r\nhave followed \"a wise and generous policy toward neutrals, which had\r\ndoubtless been in Seward's mind from the beginning[263].\" In the end he\r\nconcluded the negotiation gracefully, writing to Adams a pledge of\r\nAmerican respect for the second and third articles of the Declaration of\r\nParis--exactly that which Lyons had originally been instructed by\r\nRussell to secure.\r\n\r\n     \"We regard Great Britain as a friend. Her Majesty's flag,\r\n     according to our traditional principles, covers enemy's goods\r\n     not contraband of war. Goods of Her Majesty's subjects, not\r\n     contraband of war, are exempt from confiscation, though found\r\n     under a neutral or disloyal flag. No depredations shall be\r\n     committed by our naval forces or by those of any of our\r\n     citizens, so far as we can prevent it, upon the vessels or\r\n     property of British subjects. Our blockade, being effective,\r\n     must be respected[264].\"\r\n\r\nThus Bancroft regards Seward's proposals of April 24 as in part the\r\nresult of humanitarian motives and in part as having a concealed purpose\r\nof Northern advantage. This last he calls a \"trap.\" And it is to be\r\nnoted that in Seward's final pledge to Adams the phrase \"those of any of\r\nour citizens\" reserves, for the North, since the negotiation had failed,\r\nthe right to issue privateers on her own account. But Russell also, says\r\nBancroft, was not \"altogether artless and frank.\" He had in view a\r\nBritish commercial advantage during the war, since if the United States\r\nrespected the second and third articles of the Declaration of Paris, and\r\n\"if Confederate privateers should roam the ocean and seize the ships and\r\ngoods of citizens of the North, all the better for other commercial\r\nnations; for it would soon cause the commerce of the United States to be\r\ncarried on under foreign flags, especially the British and French[265].\"\r\nUlterior motive is, therefore, ascribed to both parties in the\r\nnegotiation, and that of Seward is treated as conceived at the moment\r\nwhen a policy of seeking European friendship was dominant at Washington,\r\nbut with the hope of securing at least negative European support.\r\nSeward's persistence after European recognition of Southern belligerency\r\nis regarded as a characteristic obstinacy without a clear view of\r\npossible resulting dangerous complications.\r\n\r\nThis view discredits the acumen of the American Secretary of State and\r\nit does not completely satisfy the third historian to examine the\r\nincident in detail. Nor does he agree on the basis of British policy.\r\nCharles Francis Adams, in his \"Life\" of his father, writing in 1899,\r\nfollowed in the main the view of his brother, Henry Adams. But in 1912\r\nhe reviewed the negotiation at great length with different\r\nconclusions[266]. His thesis is that the Declaration of Paris\r\nnegotiation was an essential part of Seward's \"foreign war policy,\" in\r\nthat in case a treaty was signed with Great Britain and France and then\r\nthose Powers refused to aid in the suppression of Southern privateering,\r\nor at least permitted them access to British and French ports, a good\r\nground of complaint leading to war would be established. _This_ was the\r\nultimate ulterior purpose in Seward's mind; the negotiation was but a\r\nmethod of fixing a quarrel on some foreign Power in case the United\r\nStates should seek, as Seward desired, a cementing of the rift at home\r\nby a foreign war.\r\n\r\nIn the details of the negotiation C.F. Adams agrees with Bancroft, but\r\nwith this new interpretation. The opening misunderstanding he ascribed,\r\nas did Lyons, to the simple fact that Seward \"had refused to see the\r\ndespatch\" in which Russell's proposals were made[267]. Seward's\r\ninstructions of July 6, after the misunderstanding was made clear to\r\nhim, pushing the negotiation, were drawn when he was \"still riding a\r\nvery high horse--the No. 10 charger, in fact, he had mounted on the 21st\r\nof the previous May[268],\" and this warlike charger he continued to ride\r\nuntil the sobering Northern defeat at Bull Run, July 21, put an end to\r\nhis folly. If that battle had been a Northern victory he would have gone\r\non with his project. Now, with the end of a period of brain-storm and\r\nthe emergence of sanity in foreign policy, \"Secretary Seward in due time\r\n(September 7) pronounced the proposed reservation [by Russell] quite\r\n'inadmissible.' And here the curtain fell on this somewhat prolonged and\r\nnot altogether creditable diplomatic farce[269].\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally C.F. Adams examined also British action and intention.\r\nLyons is wholly exonerated. \"Of him it may be fairly said that his\r\ncourse throughout seems to furnish no ground for criticism[270].\" And\r\nLyons is quoted as having understood, in the end, the real purpose of\r\nSeward's policy in seeking embroilment with Europe. He wrote to Russell\r\non December 6 upon the American publication of despatches, accompanying\r\nthe President's annual message: \"Little doubt can remain, after reading\r\nthe papers, that the accession was offered solely with the view to the\r\neffect it would have on the privateering operations of the Southern\r\nStates; and that a refusal on the part of England and France, after\r\nhaving accepted the accession, to treat the Southern privateers as\r\npirates, would have been made a serious grievance, if not a ground of\r\nquarrel[271]....\" As to Russell, combating Henry Adams' view, it is\r\nasserted that it was the great good fortune of the United States that\r\nthe British Foreign Secretary, having declared a policy of neutrality,\r\nwas not to be driven from its honest application by irritations, nor\r\nseduced into a position where the continuation of that policy would be\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon an account of the bearing of the newly available\r\nBritish materials on the negotiation--materials which will in themselves\r\noffer sufficient comment on the theories of Henry Adams, and in less\r\ndegree of Bancroft--it is best to note here the fallacy in C.F. Adams'\r\nmain thesis. If the analysis given in the preceding chapter of the\r\ninitiation and duration of Seward's \"foreign war policy\" is correct,\r\nthen the Declaration of Paris negotiation had no essential relation\r\nwhatever to that policy. The instructions to Adams were sent to eight\r\nother Ministers. Is it conceivable that Seward desired a war with the\r\nwhole maritime world? The date, April 24, antedates any deliberate\r\nproposal of a foreign war, whatever he may have been brooding, and in\r\nfact stamps the offer as part of that friendly policy toward Europe\r\nwhich Lincoln had insisted upon. Seward's frenzy for a foreign war did\r\nnot come to a head until the news had been received of England's\r\ndetermination to recognize Southern belligerency. This was in the second\r\nweek of May and on the twenty-first Despatch No. 10 marked the decline,\r\nnot the beginning, of a belligerent policy, and by the President's\r\norders. By May 24 probably, by the twenty-seventh certainly, Seward had\r\nyielded and was rapidly beginning to turn to expressions of\r\nfriendship[272]. Yet it was only on May 18 that Russell's first\r\ninstructions to Lyons were sent, and not until late in June that the\r\n\"misunderstanding\" cleared away, instructions were despatched by Seward\r\nto push the Declaration of Paris negotiations at London and Paris. The\r\nbattle of Bull Run had nothing to do with a new policy. Thus chronology\r\nforbids the inclusion of this negotiation, either in its inception,\r\nprogress, or conclusion, as an agency intended to make possible, on just\r\ngrounds, a foreign war.\r\n\r\nA mere chronological examination of documents, both printed and in\r\narchives, permits a clearer view of British policy on the Declaration of\r\nParis. Recalling the facts of the American situation known in London it\r\nwill be remembered that on May 1 the British Government and Parliament\r\nbecame aware that a civil war was inevitable and that the South planned\r\nto issue privateers. On that day Russell asked the Admiralty to\r\nreinforce the British fleet in West Indian waters that British commerce\r\nmight be adequately protected. Five days later, May 6, he announced in\r\nthe Commons that Great Britain must be strictly neutral, and that a\r\npolicy of close harmony with France was being matured; and on this day\r\nhe proposed through Cowley, in Paris, that Great Britain and France each\r\nask _both_ the contending parties in America to abide by the second and\r\nthird articles of the Declaration of Paris[273]. If there was ulterior\r\nmotive here it does not appear in any despatch either then or later,\r\npassing between any of the British diplomats concerned--Russell, Cowley,\r\nand Lyons. The plain fact was that the United States was not an adherent\r\nto the Declaration, that the South had announced privateering, and the\r\nNorth a blockade, and that the only portions of the Declaration in\r\nregard to which the belligerents had as yet made no statement were the\r\nsecond and third articles.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, an anxious time for the British Government. On May 9\r\nForster asked in the Commons what would be the Government's attitude\r\ntoward a British subject serving on a Southern privateer[274]. The next\r\nday in the Lords there occurred a debate the general burden of which was\r\nthat privateering was in fact piracy, but that under the conditions of\r\nthe American previous stand, it could not be treated as such[275]. Both\r\nin the Commons and the Lords speakers were referred to the forthcoming\r\nProclamation of Neutrality, but the uncertainty developed in both\r\ndebates is very probably reflected in the new despatch now sent to\r\nCowley, on May 11[276]. By that despatch France was asked to send an\r\ninstruction to Mercier in Washington similar to a draft instruction\r\nintended for Lyons, a copy of which was enclosed to Cowley, the object\r\nbeing to secure from the American belligerents adherence to _all_ the\r\narticles, privateering included, of the Declaration of Paris[277].\r\n\r\nWhatever Russell's purpose in thus altering his original suggestion, it\r\nmet with a prompt check from France. On May 9 Thouvenel had agreed\r\nheartily to the proposal of May 6, adding the practical advice that the\r\nbest method of approach to the Confederacy would be through the consuls\r\nin the South[278]. Now, on May 13, Russell was informed that Thouvenel\r\nfeared that England and France would get into serious trouble if the\r\nNorth agreed to accede on privateering and the South did not. Cowley\r\nreported that he had argued with Thouvenel that privateers were pirates\r\nand ought to be treated as such, but that Thouvenel refused to do more\r\nthan instruct Mercier on the second and third articles[279]. For the\r\nmoment Russell appears to have yielded easily to this French advice. On\r\nMay 13 he had that interview with the Southern commissioners in which he\r\nmentioned a communication about to be made to the South[280]; and on May\r\n15 the London _Times_, presumably reflecting governmental decision, in\r\ncommenting on the Proclamation of Neutrality, developed at some length\r\nthe idea that British citizens, if they served on Southern privateers,\r\ncould claim no protection from Great Britain if the North chose to treat\r\nthem as pirates. May 16, Cowley reported that Thouvenel had written\r\nMercier in the terms of Russell's draft to Lyons of the eleventh, but\r\nomitting the part about privateering[281], and on this same day Russell\r\nsent to Cowley a copy of a _new_ draft of instructions to Lyons,\r\nseemingly in exact accord with the French idea[282]. On the seventeenth,\r\nCowley reported this as highly satisfactory to Thouvenel[283]. Finally\r\non May 18 the completed instruction was despatched.\r\n\r\nIt was on this same day, May 18, that Adams had his first interview with\r\nRussell. All that had been planned by Great Britain and France had been\r\nbased on their estimate of the necessity of the situation. They had no\r\nknowledge of Seward's instructions of April 24. When therefore Adams,\r\ntoward the conclusion of his interview, stated his authority to\r\nnegotiate a convention, he undoubtedly took Russell by surprise. So far\r\nas he was concerned a suggestion to the North, the result of an\r\nagreement made with France after some discussion and delay, was in fact\r\ncompleted, and the draft finally drawn _two days before_, on the\r\nsixteenth. Even if not actually sent, as Henry Adams thinks, it was a\r\ncompleted agreement. Russell might well speak of it as an instruction\r\nalready given to Lyons. Moreover there were two points in Adams'\r\nconversation of the eighteenth likely to give Russell cause for thought.\r\nThe first was Adams' protest against the British recognition of a status\r\nof belligerency. If the North felt so earnestly about this, had it been\r\nwise to instruct Lyons to make an approach to the South? This required\r\nconsideration. And in the second place did not Adams' offer again open\r\nup the prospect of somehow getting from the North at least a formal and\r\npermanent renunciation of privateering?\r\n\r\nFor if an examination is made of Russell's instruction to Lyons of May\r\n18 it appears that he had not, after all, dropped that reference to\r\nprivateering which Thouvenel had omitted in his own instructions to\r\nMercier. Adams understood Russell to have said that he \"had already\r\ntransmitted authority [to Lyons] to assent to any modification of the\r\nonly point in issue which the Government of the United States might\r\nprefer. On that matter he believed that there would be no difficulty\r\nwhatever[284].\" This clearly referred to privateering. Russell's\r\ninstructions to Lyons took up the points of the Declaration of Paris in\r\nreverse order. That on blockades was now generally accepted by all\r\nnations. The principle of the third article had \"long been recognized as\r\nlaw, both in Great Britain and in the United States.\" The second\r\narticle, \"sanctioned by the United States in the earliest period of the\r\nhistory of their independence,\" had been opposed, formerly, by Great\r\nBritain, but having acquiesced in the Declaration of 1856, \"she means to\r\nadhere to the principle she then adopted.\" Thus briefly stating his\r\nconfidence that the United States would agree on three of the articles,\r\nRussell explained at length his views as to privateering in the\r\nAmerican crisis.\r\n\r\n     \"There remains only to be considered Article I, namely, that\r\n     relating to privateering, from which the Government of the\r\n     United States withheld their assent. Under these\r\n     circumstances it is expedient to consider what is required on\r\n     this subject by the general law of nations. Now it must be\r\n     borne in mind that privateers bearing the flag of one or\r\n     other of the belligerents may be manned by lawless and\r\n     abandoned men, who may commit, for the sake of plunder, the\r\n     most destructive and sanguinary outrages. There can be no\r\n     question, however, but that the commander and crew of a ship\r\n     bearing a letter of marque must, by the law of nations, carry\r\n     on their hostilities according to the established laws of\r\n     war. Her Majesty's Government must, therefore, hold any\r\n     Government issuing such letters of marque responsible for,\r\n     and liable to make good, any losses sustained by Her\r\n     Majesty's subjects in consequence of wrongful proceedings of\r\n     vessels sailing under such letters of marque.\r\n\r\n     \"In this way, the object of the Declaration of Paris may to a\r\n     certain extent be attained without the adoption of any new\r\n     principle.\r\n\r\n     \"You will urge these points upon Mr. Seward[285].\"\r\n\r\nWhat did Russell mean by this cautious statement? The facts known to him\r\nwere that Davis had proclaimed the issue of letters of marque and that\r\nLincoln had countered by proclaiming Southern privateering to be\r\npiracy[286]. He did not know that Seward was prepared to renounce\r\nprivateering, but he must have thought it likely from Lincoln's\r\nproclamation, and have regarded this as a good time to strike for an\r\nobject desired by all the European maritime nations since 1856. Russell\r\ncould not, while Great Britain was neutral, join the United States in\r\ntreating Southern privateers as pirates, but he here offered to come as\r\nclose to it as he dared, by asserting that Great Britain would use\r\nvigilance in upholding the law of nations. This language might be\r\ninterpreted as intended for the admonition of the North also, but the\r\n_facts_ of the then known situation make it applicable to Southern\r\nactivities alone. Russell had desired to include privateering in the\r\nproposals to the United States and to the South, but Thouvenel's\r\ncriticisms forced him to a half-measure of suggestion to the North, and\r\na full statement of the delicacy of the situation in the less formal\r\nletter to Lyons accompanying his official instructions. This was also\r\ndated May 18. In it Russell directed Lyons to transmit to the British\r\nConsul at Charleston or New Orleans a copy of the official instruction\r\n\"to be communicated at Montgomery to the President of the so-styled\r\nConfederate States,\" and he further explained his purpose and the\r\nBritish position:\r\n\r\n     \"... You will not err in encouraging the Government to which\r\n     you are accredited to carry into effect any disposition which\r\n     they may evince to recognize the Declaration of Paris in\r\n     regard to privateering....\r\n\r\n     \"You will clearly understand that Her Majesty's Government\r\n     cannot accept the renunciation of privateering on the part of\r\n     the Government of the United States if coupled with the\r\n     condition that they should enforce its renunciation on the\r\n     Confederate States, either by denying their right to issue\r\n     letters of marque, or by interfering with the belligerent\r\n     operations of vessels holding from them such letters of\r\n     marque, so long as they carry on hostilities according to the\r\n     recognized principles and under the admitted liabilities of\r\n     the law of nations[287].\"\r\n\r\nCertainly this was clear enough and was demanded by the British policy\r\nof neutrality. Russell had guarded against the complication feared by\r\nThouvenel, but he still hoped by a half-pledge to the North and a\r\nhalf-threat to the South to secure from both belligerents a\r\nrenunciation of privateering. In short he was not yet fully convinced of\r\nthe wisdom of the French limitation. Moreover he believed that Thouvenel\r\nmight yet be won to his own opinion, for in an unprinted portion of this\r\nsame private letter to Lyons of May 18 Russell wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"I have further to state to you, with reference to my\r\n     despatch of this day that H.M. Govt. were in the first\r\n     instance inclined to propose to both of the contending\r\n     parties to adopt the first clause of the Declaration of\r\n     Paris, by which privateering is renounced. But after\r\n     communication with the French Govt. it appeared best to limit\r\n     our propositions in the manner explained in my despatch.\r\n\r\n     \"I understand however from Lord Cowley that, although M.\r\n     Mercier is not absolutely instructed to advert to the\r\n     abolition of privateering, yet that some latitude of action\r\n     is left to him on that point should he deem it advisable to\r\n     exercise it[288].\"\r\n\r\nLyons and Mercier saw more clearly than did Russell what was in Seward's\r\nmind. Lyons had been instructed in the despatch just cited to use his\r\nown discretion as to joint action with the French Minister so long only\r\nas the two countries took the same stand. He was to pursue whatever\r\nmethod seemed most \"conciliatory.\" His first private comment on\r\nreceiving Russell's instruction was, \"Mr. Seward will be furious when he\r\nfinds that his adherence to the Declaration of Paris will not stop the\r\nSouthern privateering[289],\" and in an official confidential despatch of\r\nthe same day, June 4, he gave Russell clear warning of what Seward\r\nexpected from his overture through Adams[290]. So delicate did the\r\nmatter appear to Lyons and Mercier that they agreed to keep quiet for a\r\ntime at least about their instructions, hoping to be relieved by the\r\ntransfer of the whole matter to London and Paris[291]. But in London\r\nRussell was at this moment taking up again his favoured purpose. On June\r\n6 he wrote to Grey (temporarily replacing Cowley at Paris) that he\r\nunderstood a communication had been made in Paris, as in London, for an\r\nAmerican adherence to the Declaration of Paris; \"... it may open the way\r\nto the abolition of Privateering all over the world. But ... we ought\r\nnot to use any menace to the Confederate States with a view of obtaining\r\nthis desirable object[292].\" Evidently, in his opinion, the South would\r\nnot dare to hold out and no \"menace\" would be required[293]. Six days\r\nlater, however, having learned from the French Ambassador that Dayton in\r\nParis had made clear to Thouvenel the expectation of the United States\r\nthat France would treat Southern privateers as pirates, Russell wrote\r\nthat England, of course, could not agree to any such conclusion[294].\r\nNevertheless this did not mean that Russell yet saw any real objection\r\nto concluding a convention with the United States. Apparently he could\r\nnot believe that so obvious an inconsistency with the declared\r\nneutrality of Great Britain was expected to be obtained by the American\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nOthers were more suspicious. Lyons reported on June 13 that Seward had\r\nspecifically informed Mercier of his belief that a convention signed\r\nwould bind England and France to aid in suppressing Southern\r\nprivateering[295]. The effect of this on Lyons and Mercier was to\r\nimpress upon them the advisability of an _official_ notification to\r\nSeward, of English and French neutrality--a step not yet taken and which\r\nwas still postponed, awaiting further instructions[296]. On June 15 the\r\ntwo Ministers finally concluded they could no longer delay and made that\r\njoint visit to Seward which resulted in his refusal to receive them as\r\nacting together, or to receive officially their instructions, though he\r\nread these for his private information. The remainder of June was spent\r\nby Lyons in attempting to put matters on a more formal basis, yet not\r\npushing them unduly for fear of arousing Seward's anger. June 17, Lyons\r\ntold Seward, privately, and alone, that Great Britain _must_ have some\r\nintercourse with the South if only for the protection of British\r\ninterests. Seward's reply was that the United States might \"shut its\r\neyes\" to this, but that if notified of what England and France were\r\ndoing, the United States would be compelled to make protest. Lyons\r\nthereupon urged Seward to distinguish between his official and personal\r\nknowledge, but Lyons and Mercier again postponed beginning the\r\nnegotiation with the Confederacy[297]. Yet while thus reporting this\r\npostponement in one letter, Lyons, in another letter of the same date,\r\nindicated that the two Ministers thought that they had found a solution\r\nof the problem of how to approach, yet not negotiate with, the\r\nConfederacy. The idea was Mercier's. Their consuls in the South were to\r\nbe instructed to go, not to the Southern President, but to the Governor\r\nof the State selected, thus avoiding any overture to the Confederate\r\nGovernment[298]. Even with this solution possible they still hesitated,\r\nfeeling as Lyons wrote \"a little pusillanimous,\" but believing they had\r\nprevented an explosion[299]. Moreover Lyons was a bit uneasy because of\r\nan important difference, so it seemed to him, in his formal instructions\r\nand those of Mercier. The latter had no orders, as had Lyons, to notify\r\nSeward, if the agreement on maritime law was made in Washington, that\r\nsuch agreement would not affect the belligerent right of the South to\r\nissue privateers[300]. Apparently Mercier had been given no instructions\r\nto make this clear--let alone any \"latitude\" to deal with\r\nprivateering--although, as a matter of fact, he had already given Seward\r\nhis personal opinion in accord with Lyons' instructions; but this was\r\nnot an official French stand. Lyons was therefore greatly relieved, the\r\n\"misunderstanding\" now cleared away, that new instructions were being\r\nsent to Adams to go on with the convention in London. His only\r\nsubsequent comment of moment was sent to Russell on July 8, when he\r\nlearned from Seward that Dayton, in Paris, had been directed to raise no\r\nfurther question as to what would or would not be demanded of France in\r\ncase a convention were signed for an American adherence to the\r\nDeclaration of Paris. Lyons now repeated his former advice that under no\r\ncircumstances should a convention be signed without a distinct\r\ndeclaration of no British responsibility or duty as regards Southern\r\nprivateers[301].\r\n\r\nThe entire matter was now transferred to London and Paris. Lyons' report\r\nof the misunderstanding and that new instructions were being sent to\r\nAdams was received on June 30. Russell replied to Lyons on July 5 that\r\nAdams had \"never made any proposition\" on the Declaration of Paris, and\r\nthat he would now await one[302]. July 11, Adams made his formal offer\r\nto sign a convention and communicated a draft of it on the thirteenth.\r\nOn the day intervening, the twelfth, Russell took a very important step\r\nindicative of his sincerity throughout, of his lack of any ulterior\r\nmotive, and of his anxiety to carry through the negotiation with no\r\nresulting irritations or complications with the United States. He\r\nrecalled his instructions to Lyons about communicating with the\r\nConfederacy, stating that in any case he had never intended that Lyons\r\nshould act without first officially notifying Seward. This recall was\r\nnow made, he wrote, because to go on might \"create fresh irritation\r\nwithout any adequate result,\" but if in the meantime Lyons had already\r\nstarted negotiations with the South he might \"proceed in them to the\r\nend[303].\"\r\n\r\nHaving taken this step in the hope that it might avert friction with the\r\nUnited States, Russell, now distinctly eager to secure American\r\nadherence to the Declaration in full, was ready to conclude the\r\nconvention at once. The warnings received from many sources did not\r\ndismay him. He probably thought that no actual difficulties would ensue,\r\nbelieving that the South would not venture to continue privateering.\r\nEven if France were disinclined to make a convention he appears to have\r\nbeen ready for signature by Great Britain alone, for on July 15 he\r\ntelegraphed Cowley, \"I conclude there can be no objection to my signing\r\na Convention with the U.S. Minister giving the adherence of the U.S. to\r\nthe Declaration of Paris so far as concerns Gt. Britain. Answer\r\nimmediately by telegraph[304].\" Cowley replied on the sixteenth that\r\nThouvenel could not object, but thought it a wrong move[305]. Cowley in\r\na private letter of the same day thought that unless there were \"very\r\ncogent reasons for signing a Convention at once with Adams,\" it would be\r\nbetter to wait until France could be brought in, and he expressed again\r\nhis fear of the danger involved in Adams' proposal[306]. The same\r\nobjection was promptly made by Palmerston when shown the draft of a\r\nreply to Adams. Palmerston suggested the insertion of a statement that\r\nwhile ready to sign a convention Great Britain would do so only at the\r\nsame time with France[307]. Thus advised Russell telegraphed in the late\r\nafternoon of the sixteenth to Cowley that he would \"wait for your\r\ndespatches to-morrow,\" and that no reply had yet been given Adams[308],\r\nand on the seventeenth he wrote enclosing a draft, approved by\r\nPalmerston and the Queen, stating that Great Britain had no desire to\r\nact alone if Dayton really had instructions identical with those of\r\nAdams. He added that if thought desirable Adams and Dayton might be\r\ninformed verbally, that the proposed Convention would in no way alter\r\nthe Proclamation of Neutrality[309].\r\n\r\nThe remaining steps in the negotiation have already been narrated[310].\r\nRussell informed Adams of the requirement of a similar French\r\nconvention, Adams secured action by Dayton, and in spite of continued\r\nFrench reluctance and suspicion[311] all was ready in mid-August for the\r\naffixing of signatures, when Russell, in execution of his previous\r\npromise, and evidently now impressed with the need of an explicit\r\nunderstanding, gave notice of his intended declaration in writing to be\r\nattached to the convention[312]. On August 20 both Adams and Dayton\r\nrefused to sign, the former taking the ground, and with evident\r\nsincerity, that the \"exception\" gave evidence of a British suspicion\r\nthat was insulting to his country, while Dayton had \"hardly concealed\"\r\nfrom Thouvenel that this same \"exception\" was the very object of the\r\nConvention[313]. While preparing his rejoinder to Adams' complaint\r\nRussell wrote in a note to Palmerston \"it all looks as if a trap had\r\nbeen prepared[314].\" He, too, at last, was forced to a conclusion long\r\nsince reached by every other diplomat, save Adams, engaged in this\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nBut in reviewing the details of the entire affair it would appear that\r\nin its initiation by Seward there is no proof that he then thought of\r\nany definite \"trap\". April 24 antedated any knowledge by Seward of\r\nBritish or French policy on neutrality, and he was engaged in attempting\r\nto secure a friendly attitude by foreign Powers. One means of doing this\r\nwas by giving assurances on maritime law in time of war. True he\r\nprobably foresaw an advantage through expected aid in repressing\r\nprivateering, but primarily he hoped to persuade the maritime Powers not\r\nto recognize Southern belligerency. It was in fact this question of\r\nbelligerency that determined all his policy throughout the first six\r\nmonths of the American conflict. He was obstinately determined to\r\nmaintain that no such status existed, and throughout the whole war he\r\nreturned again and again to pressure on foreign Powers to recall their\r\nproclamations of neutrality. Refusing to recognize foreign neutrality as\r\nfinal Seward persisted in this negotiation in the hope that if completed\r\nit would place Great Britain and France in a position where they would\r\nbe forced to reconsider their declared policy. A demand upon them to aid\r\nin suppressing privateering might indeed then be used as an argument,\r\nbut the object was not privateering in itself; that object was the\r\nrecall of the recognition of Southern belligerency. In the end he simply\r\ncould not agree to the limiting declaration for it would have\r\nconstituted an acknowledgment by the United States itself of the\r\nexistence of a state of war.\r\n\r\nIn all of this Adams, seemingly, had no share. He acted on the simple\r\nand straightforward theory that the United States, pursuing a\r\nconciliatory policy, was now offering to adhere to international rules\r\nadvocated by all the maritime powers. As a result he felt both\r\npersonally and patriotically aggrieved that suspicion was directed\r\ntoward the American overtures[315]. For him the failure of the\r\nnegotiation had temporarily, at least, an unfortunate result: \"So far\r\nas the assumed friendliness of Earl Russell to the United States was\r\nconcerned, the scales had fallen from his eyes. His faith in the\r\nstraightforwardness of any portion of the Palmerston-Russell Ministry\r\nwas gone[316].\"\r\n\r\nAnd for Russell also the affair spelled a certain disillusionment, not,\r\nit is true, in the good faith of Adams, for whom he still preserved a\r\nhigh regard. Russell felt that his policy of a straightforward British\r\nneutrality, his quick acquiescence in the blockade, even before actually\r\neffective, his early order closing British ports to prizes of\r\nConfederate privateers[317], were all evidences of at least a friendly\r\nattitude toward the North. He may, as did nearly every Englishman at the\r\nmoment, think the re-union of America impossible, but he had begun with\r\nthe plan of strict neutrality, and certainly with no thought of\r\noffensive action against the North. His first thought in the Declaration\r\nof Paris negotiation was to persuade both belligerents to acquiesce in a\r\nportion of the rules of that Declaration, but almost at once he saw the\r\nlarger advantage to the world of a complete adherence by the United\r\nStates. This became Russell's fixed idea in which he persisted against\r\nwarnings and obstacles. Because of this he attempted to recall the\r\ninstruction to approach the South, was ready even, until prohibited by\r\nPalmerston, to depart from a policy of close joint action with France,\r\nand in the end was forced by that prohibition to make a limiting\r\ndeclaration guarding British neutrality. In it all there is no evidence\r\nof any hidden motive nor of any other than a straightforward, even if\r\nobstinately blind, procedure. The effect on Russell, at last grudgingly\r\nadmitting that there had been a \"trap,\" was as unfortunate for good\r\nunderstanding as in the case of Adams. He also was irritated,\r\nsuspicious, and soon less convinced that a policy of strict neutrality\r\ncould long be maintained[318].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: VII., pp. 568-583.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Ch. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: _Ibid._, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Henry Adams, _Historical Essays_, p. 275.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Text as given in Moore, _Digest_, VII, p. 562.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: _Ibid._, p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _U.S. Messages and Documents, 1861-2_, p. 94.

Adams, \"Seward and the Declaration of\r\nParis,\" p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: A few facts about Southern privateering not directly\r\npertinent to this chapter are yet not without interest. There was no\r\ncase during the Civil War of a vessel actually going out as a privateer\r\n(i.e., a private vessel operating under government letters of marque)\r\nfrom a foreign port. (Adams, \"Seward and the Declaration of Paris,\" p.\r\n38.) No Southern privateer ever entered a British port. (Bernard,\r\n_Neutrality of Great Britain_, p. 181). As a result of Seward's general\r\ninstruction of April 24, a convention was actually signed with Russia in\r\nAugust, but it was not presented by Seward for ratification to the\r\nUnited States Senate. Schleiden in a report to the Senate of Bremen at\r\nthe time of the _Trent_ affair, Nov. 14, 1861, stated that the Russian\r\nAmbassador, von Stoeckl, inquired of Seward \"whether the U.S. would\r\nequip privateers in case war should break out with England and France.\r\nSeward replied 'that is a matter of course.' Mr. Stoeckl thereupon\r\nremarked that in any case no American privateer would be permitted to\r\ncruise in the northern part of the Pacific because Russia, which is the\r\nonly state that has ports in those regions, would treat them as pirates\r\nin accordance with the Convention of August 24. Mr. Seward then\r\nexclaimed: 'I never thought of that. I must write to Mr. Clay about\r\nit.'\" (Schleiden MS.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBULL RUN; CONSUL BUNCH; COTTON AND MERCIER\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic manoeuvres and interchanges recounted in the preceding\r\nchapter were regarded by Foreign Secretaries and Ministers as important\r\nin themselves and as indicative of national policy and purpose. Upon all\r\nparties concerned they left a feeling of irritation and suspicion. But\r\nthe public knew nothing of the details of the inconclusive negotiation\r\nand the Press merely gave a hint now and then of its reported progress\r\nand ultimate failure. Newspapers continued to report the news from\r\nAmerica in unaccustomed detail, but that news, after the attack on Fort\r\nSumter, was for some time lacking in striking incident, since both sides\r\nin America were busily engaged in preparing for a struggle in arms for\r\nwhich neither was immediately prepared. April 15, Lincoln called for\r\n75,000 volunteers, and three weeks later for 42,000 additional. The\r\nregular army was increased by 23,000 and the navy by 18,000 men. Naval\r\nvessels widely scattered over the globe, were instructed to hasten their\r\nhome-coming. By July 1 Lincoln had an available land force, however\r\nbadly trained and organized, of over 300,000, though these were widely\r\nscattered from the Potomac in the east to the Missouri in the west.\r\n\r\nIn the South, Davis was equally busy, calling at first for 100,000\r\nvolunteers to wage defensive battle in protection of the newly-born\r\nConfederacy. The seven states already in secession were soon joined,\r\nbetween May 4 and June 24, by four others, Arkansas, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina and Tennessee in order, but the border states of Maryland,\r\nKentucky, and Missouri, though strongly sympathetic with the rest of the\r\nSouth, were held to the Union by the \"border state policy\" of Lincoln,\r\nthe first pronouncement of which asserted that the North had no purpose\r\nof attacking slavery where it existed, but merely was determined to\r\npreserve the Union. The Northern Congress, meeting in extra session on\r\nJuly 4, heartily approved Lincoln's emergency measures. It authorized an\r\narmy of 500,000, provided for a loan of $200,000,000, sanctioned the\r\nissue of $50,000,000 in Treasury notes and levied new taxes, both direct\r\nand by tariffs to meet these expenditures.\r\n\r\nIn the months preceding the attack on Sumter the fixed determination of\r\nthe South to secede and the uncertainty of the North had led the British\r\npress to believe that the decision rested wholly with the South. Now the\r\nNorth by its preparations was exhibiting an equally fixed determination\r\nto preserve the Union, and while the British press was sceptical of the\r\npermanence of this determination, it became, for a short time, until\r\neditorial policy was crystallized, more cautious in prophecy. The\r\n_Economist_ on May 4 declared that the responsibility for the \"fatal\r\nstep\" rested wholly on Southern leaders because of their passionate\r\ndesire to extend the shameful institution of which they were so proud,\r\nbut that the North must inevitably, by mere weight of population and\r\nwealth, be the victor, though this could not conceivably result in any\r\nreal reunion, rather in a conquest requiring permanent military\r\noccupation. Southern leaders were mad: \"to rouse by gratuitous insult\r\nthe mettle of a nation three times as numerous and far more than three\r\ntimes as powerful, to force them by aggressive steps into a struggle in\r\nwhich the sympathy of every free and civilized nation will be with the\r\nNorth, seems like the madness of men whose eyes are blinded and hearts\r\nhardened by the evil cause they defend.\"\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, the _Economist_, while still maintaining the justice of\r\nthe Northern cause, though with lessened vigour, appealed to the common\r\nsense of the North to refrain from a civil war whose professed object\r\nwas unattainable. \"Everyone knows and admits that the secession is an\r\naccomplished, irrevocable, fact.... Even if the North were sure of an\r\neasy and complete victory--short, of course, of actual subjugation of\r\nthe South (which no one dreams of)--the war which was to end in such a\r\nvictory would still be, in the eyes of prudence and worldly wisdom, an\r\nobjectless and unprofitable folly[319].\" But by the middle of June the\r\nAmerican irritation at the British Proclamation of Neutrality, loudly\r\nand angrily voiced by the Northern press, had caused a British press\r\nresentment at this \"wilful misrepresentation and misjudgment\" of British\r\nattitude. \"We _do_ believe the secession of the Slave States to be a\r\n_fait accompli_--a completed and irreversible transaction. We believe it\r\nto be impossible now for the North to lure back the South into the Union\r\nby any compromise, or to compel them back by any force.\" \"If this is an\r\noffence it cannot be helped[320].\"\r\n\r\nThe majority of the London papers, though not all, passed through the\r\nsame shifts of opinion and expression as the _Economist_; first\r\nupbraiding the South, next appealing to the North not to wage a useless\r\nwar, finally committing themselves to the theory of an accomplished\r\nbreak-up of the Union and berating the North for continuing, through\r\npride alone, a bloody conflict doomed to failure. Meanwhile in midsummer\r\nattention was diverted from the ethical causes at issue by the\r\npublication in the _Times_ of Motley's letter analysing the nature of\r\nthe American constitution and defending the legal position of the North\r\nin its resistance to secession. Motley wrote in protest against the\r\ngeneral British press attitude: \"There is, perhaps, a readiness in\r\nEngland to prejudge the case; a disposition not to exult in our\r\ndownfall, but to accept the fact[321]....\"\r\n\r\nHe argued the right and the duty of the North to force the South into\r\nsubjection. \"The right of revolution is indisputable. It is written on\r\nthe record of our race. British and American history is made up of\r\nrebellion and revolution.... There can be nothing plainer, then, than\r\nthe American right of revolution. But, then, it should be called\r\nrevolution.\" \"It is strange that Englishmen should find difficulty in\r\nunderstanding that the United States Government is a nation among the\r\nnations of the earth; a constituted authority, which may be overthrown\r\nby violence, as may be the fate of any state, whether kingdom or\r\nrepublic, but which is false to the people if it does not its best to\r\npreserve them from the horrors of anarchy, even at the cost of blood.\"\r\n\r\nMotley denied any _right_ of _peaceful_ secession, and his\r\nconstitutional argument presented adequately the Northern view. But he\r\nwas compelled also to refer to slavery and did so in the sense of\r\nLincoln's inaugural, asserting that the North had no purpose of\r\nemancipating the slaves. \"It was no question at all that slavery within\r\na state was sacred from all interference by the general government, or\r\nby the free states, or by individuals in those states; and the Chicago\r\nConvention [which nominated Lincoln] strenuously asserted that\r\ndoctrine.\" Coming at the moment when the British press and public were\r\nseeking ground for a shift from earlier pro-Northern expressions of\r\nsympathy to some justification for the South, it may be doubted whether\r\nMotley's letter did not do more harm than good to the Northern cause.\r\nHis denial of a Northern anti-slavery purpose gave excuse for a,\r\nprofessedly, more calm and judicial examination of the claimed\r\n_Southern right_ of secession, and his legal argument could be met, and\r\nwas met, with equally logical, apparently, pro-Southern argument as to\r\nthe nature of the American constitution. Thus early did the necessity of\r\nLincoln's \"border state policy\"--a policy which extended even to\r\nwarnings from Seward to American diplomats abroad not to bring into\r\nconsideration the future of slavery--give ground for foreign denial that\r\nthere were any great moral principles at stake in the American conflict.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the two sections in America were busily preparing for a\r\ntest of strength, and for that test the British press, reporting\r\npreparations, waited with interest. It came on July 21 in the first\r\nbattle of Bull Run, when approximately equal forces of raw levies,\r\n30,000 each, met in the first pitched battle of the war, and where the\r\nNorthern army, after an initial success, ultimately fled in disgraceful\r\nrout. Before Bull Run the few British papers early taking strong ground\r\nfor the North had pictured Lincoln's preparations as so tremendous as\r\ninevitably destined to crush, quickly, all Southern resistance. The\r\n_Daily News_ lauded Lincoln's message to Congress as the speech of a\r\ngreat leader, and asserted that the issue in America was for all free\r\npeople a question of upholding the eternal principles of liberty,\r\nmorality and justice. \"War for such a cause, though it be civil war, may\r\nperhaps without impiety be called 'God's most perfect instrument in\r\nworking out a pure intent[322].'\" The disaster to the Northern army, its\r\napparent testimony that the North lacked real fighting men, bolstered\r\nthat British opinion which regarded military measures against the South\r\nas folly--an impression reinforced in the next few months by the long\r\npause by the North before undertaking any further great effort in the\r\nfield. The North was not really ready for determined war, indeed, until\r\nlater in the year. Meanwhile many were the moralizations in the British\r\npress upon Bull Run's revelation of Northern military weakness.\r\n\r\nProbably the most influential newspaper utterances of the moment were\r\nthe letters of W.H. Russell to the _Times_. This famous\r\nwar-correspondent had been sent to America in the spring of 1861 by\r\nDelane, editor of the _Times_, his first letter, written on March 29,\r\nappearing in the issue of April 16. He travelled through the South, was\r\nmet everywhere with eager courtesy as became a man of his reputation and\r\none representing the most important organ of British public opinion,\r\nreturned to the North in late June, and at Washington was given intimate\r\ninterviews by Seward and other leaders. For a time his utterances were\r\nwatched for, in both England and America, with the greatest interest and\r\nexpectancy, as the opinions of an unusually able and thoroughly honest,\r\ndispassionate observer. He never concealed his abhorrence of slavery,\r\nterming apologists of that institution \"the miserable sophists who\r\nexpose themselves to the contempt of the world by their paltry theiscles\r\non the divine origin and uses of Slavery[323]....\" and writing \"day\r\nafter day ... the impression of my mind was strengthened that 'States\r\nRights' meant protection to slavery, extension of slave territory, and\r\nfree-trade in slave produce with the other world[324].\" But at the same\r\ntime he depicted the energy, ability, and determination of the South in\r\nhigh colours, and was a bit doubtful of similar virtues in the North.\r\nThe battle of Bull Run itself he did not see, but he rode out from\r\nWashington to meet the defeated army, and his description of the routed\r\nrabble, jostling and pushing, in frenzy toward the Capitol, so ridiculed\r\nNorthern fighting spirit as to leave a permanent sting behind it. At\r\nthe same time it convinced the British pro-Southern reader that the\r\nNorthern effort was doomed to failure, even though Russell was himself\r\nguarded in opinion as to ultimate result. \"'What will England and France\r\nthink of it?' is the question which is asked over and over again,\" wrote\r\nRussell on July 24[325], expatiating on American anxiety and chagrin in\r\nthe face of probable foreign opinion. On August 22 he recorded in his\r\ndiary the beginnings of the American newspaper storm of personal attack\r\nbecause of his description of the battle in the _Times_--an attack which\r\nbefore long became the alleged cause of his recall by Delane[326]. In\r\nfact Russell's letters added nothing in humiliating description to the\r\noutpourings of the Northern press, itself greedily quoted by\r\npro-Southern foreign papers. The impression of Northern military\r\nincapacity was not confined to Great Britain--it was general throughout\r\nEurope, and for the remainder of 1861 there were few who ventured to\r\nassert a Northern success in the war[327].\r\n\r\nOfficial Britain, however, saw no cause for any change in the policy of\r\nstrict neutrality. Palmerston commented privately, \"The truth is, the\r\nNorth are fighting for an Idea chiefly entertained by professional\r\npoliticians, while the South are fighting for what they consider rightly\r\nor wrongly vital interests,\" thus explaining to his own satisfaction why\r\na Northern army of brave men had _chosen_ to _run_ away[328], but the\r\nGovernment was careful to refrain from any official utterances likely to\r\nirritate the North. The battle served, in some degree, to bring into the\r\nopen the metropolitan British papers which hitherto professing\r\nneutrality and careful not to reveal too openly their leanings, now each\r\ntook a definite stand and became an advocate of a cause. The Duke of\r\nArgyll might write reassuringly to Mrs. Motley to have no fear of\r\nBritish interference[329], and to Gladstone (evidently controverting the\r\nlatter's opinion) that slavery was and would continue to be an object in\r\nthe war[330], but the press, certainly, was not united either as to\r\nfuture British policy or on basic causes and objects of the war. The\r\n_Economist_ believed that a second Southern victory like Bull Run, if\r\ncoming soon, would \"so disgust and dishearten the shouters for the Union\r\nthat the contest will be abandoned on the instant.... Some day, with\r\nscarcely any notice, we may receive tidings that an armistice has been\r\nagreed upon and preliminaries of peace have been signed[331].\" John\r\nBright's paper, the _Morning Star_, argued long and feverishly that\r\nEnglishmen must not lose sight of the fact that slavery was an issue,\r\nand made appeal for expressions, badly needed at the moment, of\r\npro-Northern sympathy[332]. To this _John Bull_ retorted:\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing can be clearer than this, that black slavery has\r\n     nothing whatever to do with this Civil War in America.... The\r\n     people of America have erected a political idol. The\r\n     Northerners have talked and written and boasted so much about\r\n     their Republic that they have now become perfectly furious to\r\n     find that their idol can be overthrown, and that the false\r\n     principles upon which the American Republic is built should\r\n     be exhibited to the world, that their vaunted democracy\r\n     should be exposed as a mere bubble or a piece of rotten\r\n     timber, an abominable and worthless tyranny of the sovereign\r\n     mob[333].\"\r\n\r\nHere was an early hint of the future of democracy as at issue[334].\r\n_John Bull_, the \"country squire's paper,\" might venture to voice the\r\nthought, but more important papers were still cautious in expressing it.\r\nW.H. Russell, privately, wrote to Delane: \"It is quite obvious, I think,\r\nthat the North will succeed in reducing the South[335].\" But Delane\r\npermitted no such positive prophecy to appear in the _Times_. Darwin is\r\ngood testimony of the all-prevalent British feeling: \"I hope to God we\r\nEnglish are utterly wrong in doubting whether the North can conquer the\r\nSouth.\" \"How curious it is that you seem to think that you can conquer\r\nthe South; and I never meet a soul, even those who would most wish it,\r\nwho think it possible--that is, to conquer and retain it[336].\"\r\n\r\nIn September, after the first interest in Bull Run had waned, there\r\nappeared several books and articles on the American question which gave\r\nopportunity for renewal of newspaper comment and controversy. A Dr.\r\nLempriere, \"of the Inner Temple, law fellow of St. John's College,\r\nOxford,\" published a work, _The American Crisis Considered_, chiefly\r\ndeclamatory, upholding the right of Southern secession, stating that no\r\none \"who has the slightest acquaintance with the political action of\r\nhistory would term the present movement rebellion.\" With this the\r\n_Spectator_ begged leave to differ[337]. The _Saturday Review_\r\nacknowledged that a prolonged war might force slavery and emancipation\r\nto the front, but denied them as vital at present, and offered this view\r\nas a defence against the recrimination of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe,\r\nwho had accused the paper of unfair treatment in a review of her\r\npamphlet exhibiting emancipation as the object of the North. Under the\r\ncaption, \"Mrs. Beecher Stowe's Wounded Feelings,\" the _Saturday Review_\r\navowed disbelief in the existence of a \"Holy War\" in America. \"The North\r\ndoes not proclaim abolition and never pretended to fight for\r\nanti-slavery. The North has not hoisted for its oriflamme the Sacred\r\nSymbol of Justice to the Negro; its _cri de guerre_ is not unconditional\r\nemancipation.\" \"The Governmental course of the British nation ... is not\r\nyet directed by small novelists and their small talk[338].\" Thomas\r\nHughes also came in for sarcastic reference in this article, having\r\npromptly taken up the cudgels for Mrs. Stowe. He returned to the attack\r\nthrough the columns of the _Spectator_, reasserting slavery as an issue\r\nand calling on Englishmen to put themselves in the place of Americans\r\nand realize the anger aroused by \"deliberate imputations of mean\r\nmotives,\" and by the cruel spirit of the utterances. A nation engaged in\r\na life and death struggle should not be treated in a tone of flippant\r\nand contemptuous serenity. The British press had chosen \"to impute the\r\nlowest motives, to cull out and exult over all the meanness, and\r\nbragging, and disorder which the contest has brought out, and while we\r\nsit on the bank, to make no allowances for those who are struggling in\r\nthe waves[339].\"\r\n\r\nBesides the _Spectator_, on the Northern side, stood the _Daily News_,\r\ndeclaring that the South could not hold out, and adding,\r\n\"The Confederate States may be ten millions, but they _are_\r\nwrong--notoriously, flagrantly wrong[340].\" The _Daily News_, according\r\nto its \"Jubilee\" historians, stood almost alone in steadfast advocacy of\r\nthe Northern cause[341]. This claim of unique service to the North is\r\nnot borne out by an examination of newspaper files, but is true if only\r\nmetropolitan dailies of large circulation are considered. The\r\n_Spectator_ was a determined and consistent friend of the North. In its\r\nissue of September 28 a speech made by Bulwer Lytton was summarized and\r\nattacked. The speaker had argued that the dissolution of the Union would\r\nbe beneficial to all Europe, which had begun to fear the swollen size\r\nand strength of the young nation across the Atlantic. He hoped that the\r\nfinal outcome would be not two, but at least four separate nations, and\r\nstated his belief that the friendly emulation of these nations would\r\nresult for Americans in a rapid advance in art and commerce such as had\r\nbeen produced in the old commonwealths of Greece. The _Spectator_\r\nanswered that such a breaking up of America was much more likely to\r\nresult in a situation comparable to that in South America, inquired\r\ncaustically whether Bulwer Lytton had heard that slavery was in\r\nquestion, and asserted that his speech presumably represented the\r\nofficial view of the Tories, and embodied that of the English governing\r\nclass[342].\r\n\r\nIn press utterances during the autumn and early fall of 1861 there is\r\nlittle on British policy toward America. Strict neutrality is approved\r\nby all papers and public speakers. But as the months passed without\r\nfurther important military engagements attention began to be directed\r\ntoward the economic effects on England of the war in America and to the\r\nblockade, now beginning to be made effective by the North. The _Saturday\r\nReview_, though pro-Southern, declared for neutrality, but distinguished\r\nbetween strict observance of the blockade and a reasonable recognition\r\nof the _de facto_ government of the Confederacy \"as soon as the Southern\r\nStates had achieved for their independence that amount of security with\r\nwhich Great Britain had been satisfied in former cases[343].\" But\r\nanother article in the same issue contained a warning against forcibly\r\nraising the blockade since this must lead to war with the North, and\r\nthat would commend itself to no thoughtful Englishman. Two weeks later\r\nappeared a long review of Spence's _American Union_, a work very\r\ninfluential in confirming British pro-Southern belief in the\r\nconstitutional right of the South to secede and in the certainty of\r\nSouthern victory. Spence was \"likely to succeed with English readers,\r\nbecause all his views are taken from a thoroughly English\r\nstandpoint[344].\" The week following compliments are showered upon the\r\n\"young professor\" Montague Bernard for his \"Two Lectures on the Present\r\nAmerican War,\" in which he distinguished between recognition of\r\nbelligerency and recognition of sovereignty, asserting that the former\r\nwas inevitable and logical. The _Saturday Review_, without direct\r\nquotation, treated Bernard as an advocate also of the early recognition\r\nof Southern independence on the ground that it was _a fait accompli_,\r\nand expressed approval[345].\r\n\r\nThese few citations, taken with intent from the more sober and reputable\r\njournals, summarize the prevailing attitude on one side or the other\r\nthroughout the months from June to December, 1861. All publications had\r\nmuch to say of the American struggle and varied in tone from dignified\r\ncriticism to extreme vituperation, this last usually being the resort of\r\nlesser journals, whose leader writers had no skill in \"vigorous\" writing\r\nin a seemingly restrained manner. \"Vigorous\" leader writing was a\r\ncharacteristic of the British press of the day, and when combined with a\r\nsupercilious British tone of advice, as from a superior nation, gave\r\ngreat offence to Americans, whether North or South. But the British\r\npress was yet united in proclaiming as correct the governmental policy\r\nof neutrality, and in any event Motley was right in stating \"the Press\r\nis not the Government,\" adding his opinion that \"the present English\r\nGovernment has thus far given us no just cause of offence[346].\"\r\nMeanwhile the Government, just at the moment when the Declaration of\r\nParis negotiation had reached an inglorious conclusion, especially\r\nirritating to Earl Russell, was suddenly plunged into a sharp\r\ncontroversy with the United States by an incident growing out of\r\nRussell's first instructions to Lyons in regard to that negotiation and\r\nwhich, though of minor importance in itself, aroused an intensity of\r\nfeeling beyond its merits. This was the recall by Seward of the\r\nexequatur of the British consul Bunch, at Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in his first instruction to Lyons on the\r\nDeclaration of Paris Russell had directed that Bunch, at Charleston, be\r\ncommissioned to seek a Southern official acceptance of the binding force\r\nof the second and third articles, but that Lyons and Mercier, fearing\r\nSeward's irritation, had hesitated to proceed in the matter. Later\r\nRussell had recalled his instructions, but before this recall could\r\nreach Lyons the latter had decided to act[347]. On July 5 Lyons gave\r\nexplicit directions to Bunch not to approach the Confederate Government\r\ndirectly, but to go to Governor Pickens of South Carolina and explain\r\nthe matter to him verbally, adding \"you should act with great caution,\r\nin order to avoid raising the question of the recognition of the new\r\nConfederation by Great Britain.\" Unfortunately Lyons also wrote, \"I am\r\nauthorized by Lord John Russell to confide the negotiation on this\r\nmatter to you,\" thus after all implying that a real _negotiation_ with\r\nthe South was being undertaken. On the same day Mercier sent similar\r\ninstructions to St. André, the French Acting-Consul at Charleston[348].\r\nBunch received Lyons' official letter on July 19[349], together with a\r\nprivate one of July 5, emphasizing that Bunch was to put nothing in\r\nwriting, and that he and his French colleagues were to keep the names of\r\nLyons and Mercier out of any talk, even, about the matter. Bunch was to\r\ntalk as if his instructions came directly from Russell. Lyons hoped the\r\nSouth would be wise enough not to indulge in undue publicity, since if\r\n\"trumpeted\" it might elicit \"by such conduct some strong disavowal from\r\nFrance and England.\" Both the official and the private letter must,\r\nhowever, have impressed Bunch with the idea that this was after all a\r\nnegotiation and that he had been entrusted with it[350].\r\n\r\nBunch, whose early reports had been far from sympathetic with the\r\nSouthern cause, had gradually, and quite naturally from his environment,\r\nbecome more friendly to it[351]. He now acted with promptness and with\r\nsome evident exultation at the importance given him personally. In\r\nplace of Governor Pickens an experienced diplomat, William Henry\r\nTrescott, was approached by Bunch and Belligny, who, not St. André, was\r\nthen the French agent at Charleston[352]. Trescott went directly to\r\nPresident Davis, who at once asked why the British proposal had not been\r\nmade through the Confederate Commissioners in London, and who somewhat\r\nunwillingly yielded to Trescott's urging. On August 13 the Confederate\r\nCongress resolved approval of the Declaration of Paris except for the\r\narticle on privateering[353]. Bunch took great pride in the secrecy\r\nobserved. \"I do not see how any clue is given to the way in which the\r\nResolutions have been procured.... We made a positive stipulation that\r\nFrance and England were not to be alluded to in the event of the\r\ncompliance of the Confederate Govt.[354],\" he wrote Lyons on August 16.\r\nBut he failed to take account either of the penetrating power of\r\nmouth-to-mouth gossip or of the efficacy of Seward's secret agents. On\r\nthis same day, August 16, Lyons reported the arrest in New York, on the\r\nfourteenth, of one Robert Mure, just as he was about to take passage for\r\nLiverpool carrying a sealed bag from the Charleston consulate to the\r\nBritish Foreign Office, as well as some two hundred private letters. The\r\nletters were examined and among them was one which related Bunch's\r\nrecent activities and stated that \"Mr. B., on oath of secrecy,\r\ncommunicated to me also that the first step of recognition was\r\ntaken[355].\" The sealed bag was sent unopened to be handed by Adams to\r\nRussell with an enquiry whether in fact it contained any papers on the\r\nalleged \"negotiation\" with the South.\r\n\r\nBunch had issued to Mure a paper which the latter regarded as a\r\npassport, as did the United States. This also was made matter of\r\ncomplaint by Adams, when on September 3 the affair was presented to\r\nRussell. America complained of Bunch on several counts, the three\r\nprincipal ones being (1) that he had apparently conducted a negotiation\r\nwith the Confederacy, (2) that he had issued a passport, not\r\ncountersigned by the Secretary of State as required by the United States\r\nrules respecting foreign consuls, (3) that he had permitted the person\r\nto whom this passport was issued to carry letters from the enemies of\r\nthe United States to their agents abroad. On these grounds the British\r\nGovernment was requested to remove Bunch from his office. On first\r\nlearning of Mure's arrest Lyons expressed the firm belief that Bunch's\r\nconduct had been perfectly proper and that the sealed bag would be found\r\nto contain nothing supporting the suspicion of the American\r\nGovernment[356]. The language used by Lyons was such as to provide an\r\nexcellent defence in published despatches, and it was later so used. But\r\nprivately neither Lyons nor Russell were wholly convinced of the\r\ncorrectness of Bunch's actions. Bunch had heard of Mure's arrest on\r\nAugust 18, and at once protested that no passport had been given, but\r\nmerely a \"Certificate to the effect that he [Mure] was a British\r\nMerchant residing in Charleston\" on his way to England, and that he was\r\ncarrying official despatches to the Foreign Office[357]. In fact Mure\r\nhad long since taken out American citizenship papers, and the\r\ndistinction between passport and certificate seems an evasion.\r\nOfficially Lyons could report \"it is clear that Mr. Robert Mure, in\r\ntaking charge of the letters which have been seized, abused Mr. Bunch's\r\nconfidence, for Mr. Bunch had positive instructions from me not to\r\nforward himself any letters alluding to military or political events,\r\nexcepting letters to or from British officials[358].\" This made good\r\nreading when put in the published Parliamentary Papers. But in reality\r\nthe sending of private letters by messenger also carrying an official\r\npouch was no novelty. Bunch had explained to Lyons on June 23 that this\r\nwas his practice on the ground that \"there is really no way left for the\r\nmerchants but through me. If Mr. Seward objects I cannot help it. I must\r\nleave it to your Lordship and H.M.'s Government to support me. My own\r\ndespatch to Lord J. Russell I must send in some way, and so I take the\r\nresponsibility of aiding British interests by sending the mercantile\r\nletters as well[359].\" And in Bunch's printed report to Lyons on Mure's\r\narrest, his reply as to the private letters was, \"I could not consider\r\nhim [Mure] as being disqualified from being the bearer of a bag to Earl\r\nRussell, by his doing what everyone who left Charleston was doing\r\ndaily[360]....\"\r\n\r\nOfficially Lyons, on September 2, had reported a conversation with\r\nBelligny, the French Consul at Charleston, now in Washington, writing,\r\n\"I am confirmed in the opinion that the negotiation, which was difficult\r\nand delicate, was managed with great tact and good judgment by the two\r\nConsuls[361].\" But this referred merely to the use of Trescott and its\r\nresults, not to Bunch's use of Mure. The British Government was, indeed,\r\nprepared to defend the action of its agents in securing, _indirectly_,\r\nfrom the South, an acknowledgment of certain principles of\r\ninternational law. Russell did not believe that Lincoln was \"foolhardy\r\nenough to quarrel with England and France,\" though Hammond (Under\r\nSecretary of Foreign Affairs) \"is persuaded that Seward wishes to pick a\r\nquarrel[362].\" Enquiry was promptly made of France, through Cowley, as\r\nto her stand in the matter of the consuls at Charleston, Russell\r\nintimating by an enquiry (later printed in the Parliamentary Papers), as\r\nto the initiation of the Declaration of Paris negotiations, that it was\r\nThouvenel who had first suggested the approach to the South through the\r\nConsuls[363]. This was an error of memory[364], and Cowley was perturbed\r\nby Thouvenel's reticence in reply to the main question. The latter\r\nstated that if a like American demand were made on France \"undoubtedly\r\nhe could not give up an Agent who had done no more than execute the\r\norders entrusted to him[365].\" This looked like harmony, but the\r\nsituation for the two countries was not the same as no demand had been\r\nmade for the recall of Belligny. Cowley was, in reality, anxious and\r\nsuspicious, for Thouvenel, in conversation, attributed Seward's anger to\r\nBunch's alleged indiscretions in talk, and made it clear that France\r\nwould not \"stand by\" unless Seward should protest to France against the\r\nfact of a communication (not a _negotiation_) having been held with the\r\nConfederacy[366]. Before the French reply was secured Russell had\r\nprepared but not sent an answer to Adams, notifying him that the bag\r\nfrom Bunch, on examination, was found not to contain \"correspondence of\r\nthe enemies of the Government of the United States\" as had been\r\nsuspected, and transmitting a copy of Bunch's explanation of the reason\r\nfor forwarding private letters[367]. In another letter to Adams of the\r\nsame date Russell avowed the Government's responsibility for Bunch's\r\naction on the Declaration of Paris, and declined to recall him, adding:\r\n\r\n     \"But when it is stated in a letter from some person not\r\n     named, that the first step to the recognition of the Southern\r\n     States by Great Britain has been taken, the Undersigned begs\r\n     to decline all responsibility for such a statement.\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty's Government have already recognized the\r\n     belligerent character of the Southern States, and they will\r\n     continue to recognize them as belligerents. But Her Majesty's\r\n     Government have not recognized and are not prepared to\r\n     recognize the so-called Confederate States as a separate and\r\n     independent State[368].\"\r\n\r\nAdams received Russell's two notes on September 13[369], and merely\r\nstated that they would be despatched by the next steamer. That Russell\r\nwas anxious is shown by a careful letter of caution to Lyons instructing\r\nhim if sent away from Washington \"to express in the most dignified and\r\nguarded terms that the course taken by the Washington Government must be\r\nthe result of a misconception on their part, and that you shall retire\r\nto Canada in the persuasion that the misunderstanding will soon cease,\r\nand the former friendly relations be restored[370].\" Meantime Russell\r\nwas far from satisfied with Bunch, writing Lyons to inform him\r\nthat the \"statements made in regard to his proceedings require\r\nexplanation[371].\" The failure of Seward to demand Belligny's recall\r\nworried Russell. He wrote to Palmerston on September 19, \"I cannot\r\nbelieve that the Americans, having made no demand on the French to\r\ndisavow Belligny, or Baligny, will send away Lyons,\" and he thought that\r\nSeward ought to be satisfied as England had disavowed the offensive part\r\nof Bunch's supposed utterances. He was not in favour of sending\r\nreinforcements to the American stations: \"If they do not quarrel about\r\nBunch, we may rest on our oars for the winter[372].\" There was nothing\r\nfurther to do save to wait Seward's action on receipt of the British\r\nrefusal to recall Bunch. At this moment Lyons at Washington was writing\r\nin a hopeful view of \"avoiding abstract assertions of principles,\" but\r\naccustoming the North to the _practice_ of British recognition of\r\nSouthern belligerent rights[373]. Lyons believed that Seward would not\r\ngo further than to withdraw Bunch's exequatur, but he was anxious for\r\nthe return of Mercier (long absent with Prince Napoleon), since \"our\r\nposition is unluckily not exactly the same with that of France[374].\" On\r\nOctober 12 Lyons conferred at length with Seward on the Bunch matter, as\r\nusual, privately and unofficially. Seward dwelt on a letter just\r\nreceived from Motley assuring him that Great Britain was not \"unfriendly\r\nto the United States,\" and \"appeared anxious not to pick a quarrel, yet\r\nhardly knowing how to retract from his original position.\" Lyons told\r\nSeward that it would be \"impossible to carry on the Diplomatic\r\nbusiness ... on the false hypothesis that the United States Government\"\r\ndid not _know_ England and France had recognized the belligerent rights\r\nof the South, and he urged Russell to get from France an open\r\nacknowledgment, such as England has made, that she \"negotiated\" with\r\nthe Confederacy. Lyons thought Mercier would try to avoid this, thus\r\nseeking to bring pressure on the British Government to adopt his plan\r\nof an early recognition of Southern independence. Like Cowley, Lyons\r\nwas disturbed at the French evasion of direct support in the Bunch\r\naffair[375].\r\n\r\nBunch's formal denial to Lyons of the charges made against him by the\r\nUnited States was confined to three points; he asserted his disbelief\r\nthat Mure carried any despatches from the _de facto_ government at\r\nRichmond; he protested that \"there was not one single paper in my bag\r\nwhich was not entirely and altogether on Her Majesty's service\"; and he\r\nexplained the alleged \"passport\" was not intended as such, but was\r\nmerely \"a certificate stating that Mr. Mure was charged by me with\r\ndespatches,\" but he acknowledged that in the certificate's description\r\nof Mure as a \"British merchant\" a possible error had been committed,\r\nadding, however, that he had supposed anyone would understand, since the\r\nwords \"British subject\" had not been used, that Mure was in reality a\r\nnaturalized citizen of America[376]. This explanation was received by\r\nRussell on October 21. Lyons' comment on Bunch's explanation, made\r\nwithout knowledge of what would be Seward's final determination, was\r\nthat if Bunch had any further excuses to make about the private letters\r\ncarried by Mure he should drop two weak points in his argument. \"I mean\r\nthe distinction between B. merchant and B.S., and the distinction\r\nbetween a document requesting that the bearer '_may be permitted to pass\r\nfreely and receive all proper protection and assistance_' and a\r\npassport[377].\" Russell, on receipt of Bunch's explanation was also\r\ndissatisfied, first because Bunch had violated Lyons' instructions\r\nagainst entrusting despatches to persons carrying private\r\ncorrespondence, and second, because Bunch \"gives no distinct denial\" to\r\nthe newspaper stories that he had gossiped about his activities and had\r\nstated them to be \"a first step toward recognition[378].\" These\r\ncriticisms were directed entirely to Bunch's conduct subsequent to the\r\noverture to the South; on the propriety of that act Russell supported\r\nBunch with vigour[379]. October 26, Seward read to Lyons the instruction\r\nto Adams on the revocation of Bunch's exequatur. The ground taken for\r\nthis, reported Lyons, was an evasion of that charge of communicating\r\nwith the South for which Russell had avowed responsibility, and a\r\nturning to the charge that Bunch was personally unacceptable longer to\r\nthe United States because of his partisanship to the South, as evidenced\r\nby various acts and especially as shown by his reported assertion that\r\nGreat Britain had taken \"a first step to recognition.\" \"Never,\" wrote\r\nLyons, \"were serious charges brought upon a slighter foundation.\" \"No\r\none who has read Mr. Bunch's despatches to your Lordship and to me can\r\nconsider him as in the least degree a partisan of the Southern cause.\"\r\n\"When Mr. Seward had finished reading the despatch I remained silent.\r\nAfter a short pause I took leave of him courteously, and\r\nwithdrew[380].\"\r\n\r\nAs will have been noted, Lyons had foreseen the American decision\r\nagainst Bunch on purely personal grounds, had been relieved that this\r\nwould be the issue, and had fore-warned Russell. His despatch just\r\ncited may be regarded as a suggestion of the proper British refutation\r\nof charges, but with acceptance of the American decision. Nevertheless\r\nhe wrote gloomily on the same day of future relations with the United\r\nStates[381]. At the same time Russell, also foreseeing Seward's action,\r\nwas not disturbed. He thought it still \"not off the cards that the\r\nSouthern Confederates may return to the Union.... Our conduct must be\r\nstrictly neutral, and it will be[382].\" Upon receipt of Lyons' despatch\r\nand letter of October 28 Russell wrote to Palmerston, \"I do not attach\r\nmuch importance to this letter of Lyons. It is the business of Seward to\r\nfeed the mob with sacrifices every day, and we happen to be the most\r\ngrateful food he can offer[383].\" For Russell saw clearly that Great\r\nBritain could not object to the removal of Bunch on the purely personal\r\ngrounds alleged by Seward. There followed in due course the formal\r\nnotification by Adams on November 21, just six days before he learned of\r\nthe _Trent_ affair, which had occurred on November 8. That alarming\r\nincident no doubt coloured the later communications of both parties, for\r\nwhile both Adams and Russell indulged in several lengthy argumentative\r\npapers, such as are dear to the hearts of lawyers and diplomats, the\r\nonly point of possible further dispute was on the claim of Great Britain\r\nthat future occasions might arise where, in defence of British\r\ninterests, it would be absolutely necessary to communicate with the\r\nConfederacy. Adams acknowledged a British duty to protect its citizens,\r\nbut reasserted the American right to dismiss any British agent who\r\nshould act as Bunch had done. On December 9, Russell closed the matter\r\nby stating that he did \"not perceive that any advantage would be\r\nobtained by the continuance of this correspondence[384].\" Bunch was\r\nexpected to leave Charleston as soon as a safe conveyance could be\r\nprovided for him, but this was not immediately forthcoming. In fact he\r\nremained at Charleston until February, 1863, actively engaged, but\r\nofficial papers were signed by his vice-consul. In the excitement over\r\nthe _Trent_, he seems rapidly to have disappeared from the official as\r\nhe did from the public horizon[385].\r\n\r\nThe Bunch controversy, seemingly of no great importance in so far as the\r\nalleged personal grounds of complaint are concerned, had its real\r\nsignificance in the effort of Great Britain to make contact with the\r\nSouthern Government--an effort incautiously entered upon, and from which\r\nan attempt to withdraw had come too late. The result was British\r\nassertion of a right in case of necessity to make such contact, having\r\nrecognized the South as a belligerent, but a discontinuance of the\r\npractice, under the American protest[386]. While this controversy was in\r\nprogress the attention of the British Government was directed to a\r\nproposal urged by Mercier upon Lyons in Washington, which appeared to\r\nhave the support of the French Government. On September 30, Mercier, so\r\nLyons reported, had received a private letter from Thouvenel expressing\r\ngreat concern over the prospective scarcity of cotton from America, due\r\nto the blockade, and asking Mercier's advice. The latter now informed\r\nLyons that his reply had outlined the following steps: first, complete\r\nharmony of action between England and France; second, recognition of\r\nSouthern independence; third, refusal longer to recognize the blockade;\r\nfourth, England and France to be alert to seize the \"favourable moment,\"\r\nwhen the North became disheartened, the present moment not being a good\r\none[387]. This policy Mercier thought so \"bold\" that the North would be\r\ndeterred from declaring war. The two diplomats held long argument over\r\nthis suggestion. Lyons acknowledged the general pressure for cotton, but\r\nthought there was no need of great alarm as yet and also advanced the\r\nidea that in the end Europe would benefit by being forced to develop\r\nother sources of supply, thus being freed from such exclusive\r\ndependence on the United States. Mercier answered that France was in\r\ndire need and could not wait and he urged that mere recognition of the\r\nSouth would not secure cotton--it was necessary also to break the\r\nblockade. In comment to Russell, Lyons agreed that this was true, but\r\nthought the fact in itself an argument against accepting Mercier's\r\nideas: \"The time is far distant when the intervention of England and\r\nFrance in the quarrel would be welcomed, or, unless under compulsion,\r\ntolerated by the American peoples.\" The South had not yet \"gone far\r\nenough in establishing its independence to render a recognition of it\r\neither proper or desirable for European powers,\" and he stated with\r\nemphasis that recognition would _not_ end the war unless there was also\r\nan _alliance_ with the South[388].\r\n\r\nIn the British Cabinet also, at this same time, attention was being\r\ndirected to the question of cotton, not, primarily, by any push from the\r\nBritish manufacturing interest, but because of queries addressed to it\r\nby the French Minister in London. Russell wrote to Palmerston, referring\r\nto the inquiry of Flahault, \"I agree with you that the cotton question\r\nmay become serious at the end of the year,\" but he added that Lindsay\r\nhad informed him that in any case cotton could not be brought in the\r\nwinter-time from the interior to the Southern ports[389]. In truth any\r\nserious thought given at this time to the question of cotton appears to\r\nbe the result of the French arguments at London and Washington\r\nadvocating a vigorous American policy. October 19, Lyons and Mercier\r\nrenewed debate on exactly the same lines as previously, Mercier this\r\ntime reading to Lyons an instruction from Thouvenel and his reply. Lyons\r\ninsisted that the North would most certainly declare war on any power\r\nthat recognized the South and asserted that such a war would cause more\r\nsuffering many times than all the suffering now caused by the shortage\r\nof cotton. Yet Lyons felt compelled to use caution and conciliation in\r\ndealing with Mercier, because of the desire to preserve close harmony of\r\nattitude[390]. A few clays later Lyons' comments seemed wholly justified\r\nwhen Mercier reported to him the tone of a conversation with Seward,\r\nafter having left with him a copy of Thouvenel's instruction. Seward\r\nsaid plainly that the United States would go to war with any foreign\r\npower that tried to interfere and that the only way in which France\r\ncould get cotton was by a Northern conquest of the South. He\r\nacknowledged that the United States might be defeated, but he informed\r\nMercier that France would at least know there had been a war. On his\r\npart Mercier told Seward that in his opinion there was but one possible\r\noutcome in America--separation--and that he had advised Thouvenel that\r\nthe true policy of England and France was to recognize the South and\r\n\"bring about a peaceful separation.\" Lyons' comment to Russell is that\r\nSeward had certainly taken a \"high\" tone--evident justification of\r\nLyons' previously expressed opinion. Seward had been very eager to learn\r\nwhether England knew of Thouvenel's instruction, to which Mercier\r\nreplied \"no,\" and was now anxious that Russell should not reveal to\r\nAdams that Lyons had known the contents before delivery to Seward--a\r\ncaution with which Lyons was very content[391].\r\n\r\nLyons' first report of Mercier's ideas had been received in London at a\r\nrather critical moment. On October 17, just after Adams' complaint about\r\nBunch and Russell's answer, while waiting to see whether Seward would\r\nmagnify that incident into a cause of rupture, and four days before\r\nBunch's \"unsatisfactory explanation\" had been received, Russell wrote to\r\nPalmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"There is much good sense in Mercier's observations.\r\n     But we must wait. I am persuaded that if we do anything,\r\n     it must be on a grand scale. It will not do for England\r\n     and France to break a blockade for the sake of getting\r\n     cotton. But, in Europe, powers have often said to belligerents,\r\n     Make up your quarrels. We propose to give terms\r\n     of pacification which we think fair and equitable. If you\r\n     accept them, well and good. But, if your adversary accepts\r\n     them and you refuse them, our mediation is at an end,\r\n     and you may expect to see us your enemies. France would\r\n     be quite ready to hold this language with us.\r\n\r\n     \"If such a policy were to be adopted the time for it\r\n     would be the end of the year, or immediately before the\r\n     meeting of Parliament[392].\"\r\n\r\nApparently Russell under the irritations of the moment was somewhat\r\ncarried away by Mercier's suggestion. That it was but a briefly held\r\nthought has been shown by expressions from him already cited[393]. Nor\r\nwas he alone in ministerial uncertainty[394], but Palmerston was not\r\ninclined to alter British policy. October 18, he replied to Russell:\r\n\r\n     \"As to North America, our best and true policy seems to\r\n     be to go on as we have begun, and to keep quite clear of the\r\n     conflict between North and South.... The only\r\n     excuse [for intervention] would be the danger to the intervening\r\n     parties if the conflict went on; but in the American\r\n     case this can not be pleaded by the Powers of Europe.\r\n\r\n     \"I quite agree with you that the want of cotton would\r\n     not justify such a proceeding, unless, indeed, the distress\r\n     created by that want was far more serious than it is likely\r\n     to be. The probability is that some cotton will find its way\r\n     to us from America, and that we shall get a greater supply\r\n     than usual from other quarters.\r\n\r\n     \"The only thing to do seems to be to lie on our oars\r\n     and to give no pretext to the Washingtonians to quarrel\r\n     with us, while, on the other hand, we maintain our rights\r\n     and those of our fellow countrymen[395].\"\r\n\r\nIn Washington the result of Mercier's conversation with Seward,\r\noutlining Thouvenel's suggestions, was a long and carefully prepared\r\ndespatch to Dayton, in Paris, which the biographer of Seward thinks was\r\none of his \"great despatches; perhaps it was his greatest, if we\r\nconsider his perfect balance and the diplomatic way in which he seemed\r\nto ignore what was menacing, while he adroitly let Thouvenel see what\r\nthe result would be if the implied threats should be carried out[396].\"\r\nSeward argued with skill the entire matter of cotton, but he was none\r\nthe less firm in diplomatic defiance of foreign intervention. Since\r\nGreat Britain had taken no part in the French scheme--a point which\r\nSeward was careful to make clear to Dayton--the despatch needs no\r\nexpanded treatment here. Its significance is that when reported to Lyons\r\nby Mercier (for Seward had read it to the latter) the British Minister\r\ncould pride himself on having already pointed out to both Mercier and\r\nRussell that Seward's line was exactly that which he had prophesied.\r\nMercier again was very anxious that his confidences to Lyons should not\r\nbecome known, and Lyons was glad indeed to be wholly free from any share\r\nin the discussion[397].\r\n\r\nTwo days after thus describing events, Lyons, on November 6, had still\r\nanother communication, and apparently a last on this topic, with\r\nMercier, in which the two men again went over the whole ground of\r\nnational policy toward America, and in which their divergent views\r\nbecame very apparent. The arguments were the same, but expressed with\r\nmore vigour. Mercier seems, indeed, to have attempted to \"rush\" Lyons\r\ninto acquiescence in his policy. Lyons finally observed to him that he\r\n\"had no reason to suppose that Her Majesty's Government considered the\r\ntime was come for entertaining at all the question of recognizing the\r\nSouth\" and asked what good such a step would do anyway. Mercier replied\r\nthat he did not believe that the North would declare war, and so it\r\nwould be a step toward settlement. To this Lyons took positive\r\nexception[398]. Lyons' report of this conversation was written on\r\nNovember 8, a date which was soon to stand out as that on which occurred\r\nan event more immediately threatening to British-American relations than\r\nany other during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bull Run had left on British minds an impression of\r\nNorthern incapacity in war--even a doubt of Northern courage and\r\ndetermination. On August 19 the Declaration of Paris negotiation, a\r\nfavourable result from which was eagerly desired by Russell, had failed,\r\nas he well knew when he attached to the convention that explanatory\r\nstatement limiting its action in point of time. In the end Russell felt\r\nthat Britain had just escaped a \"trap.\" Two weeks after this Russell\r\nlearned of the arrest of Mure, and soon of the demand for Bunch's\r\nrecall, finally and formally made by Adams on November 21. Just six days\r\nlater, on November 27, London heard of the _Trent_ affair of November 8.\r\nIt is small wonder that Russell and his colleagues felt an increasing\r\nuncertainty as to the intent of the United States, and also an\r\nincreasing irritation at having to guard their steps with such care in a\r\nsituation where they sincerely believed the only possible outcome was\r\nthe dissolution of the American Union. But up to the moment when the\r\nnews of the _Trent_ affair was received they had pursued a policy, so\r\nthey believed, of strict and upright neutrality, and were fixed in the\r\ndetermination not to permit minor controversies or economic advantage to\r\ndivert them from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: _Economist_, May 18, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: _Ibid._, June 29, 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: J.L.

The Confederate agents sent to Europe at the outbreak of\r\nthe Civil War had accomplished little, and after seven months of waiting\r\nfor a more favourable turn in foreign relations, President Davis\r\ndetermined to replace them by two \"Special Commissioners of the\r\nConfederate States of America.\" These were James M. Mason of Virginia,\r\nfor Great Britain, and John Slidell of Louisiana, for France. Their\r\nappointment indicated that the South had at last awakened to the need of\r\na serious foreign policy. It was publicly and widely commented on by the\r\nSouthern press, thereby arousing an excited apprehension in the North,\r\nalmost as if the mere sending of two new men with instructions to secure\r\nrecognition abroad were tantamount to the actual accomplishment of\r\ntheir object.\r\n\r\nMason and Slidell succeeded in running the blockade at Charleston on the\r\nnight of October 12, 1861, on the Confederate steamer _Theodora_[400],\r\nand arrived at New Providence, Nassau, on the fourteenth, thence\r\nproceeded by the same vessel to Cardenas, Cuba, and from that point\r\njourneyed overland to Havana, arriving October 22. In the party there\r\nwere, besides the two envoys, their secretaries, McFarland and Eustis,\r\nand the family of Slidell. On November 7 they sailed for the Danish\r\nisland of St. Thomas, expecting thence to take a British steamer for\r\nSouthampton. The vessel on which they left Havana was the British\r\ncontract mail-packet _Trent_, whose captain had full knowledge of the\r\ndiplomatic character of his passengers. About noon on November 8 the\r\n_Trent_ was stopped in the Bahama Channel by the United States sloop of\r\nwar, _San Jacinto_, Captain Wilkes commanding, by a shot across the\r\nbows, and a boarding party took from the _Trent_ Mason and Slidell with\r\ntheir secretaries, transferred them to the _San Jacinto_, and proceeded\r\nto an American port. Protest was made both by the captain of the _Trent_\r\nand by Commander Williams, R.N., admiralty agent in charge of mails on\r\nboard the ship[401]. The two envoys also declared that they would yield\r\nonly to personal compulsion, whereupon hands were laid upon shoulders\r\nand coat collars, and, accepting this as the application of _force_,\r\nthey were transferred to the _San Jacinto's_ boats. The scene on the\r\n_Trent_, as described by all parties, both then and later, partakes of\r\nthe nature of comic opera, yet was serious enough to the participants.\r\nIn fact, the envoys, especially Slidell, were exultant in the conviction\r\nthat the action of Wilkes would inevitably result in the early\r\nrealization of the object of their journey--recognition of the South,\r\nat least by Great Britain[402]. Once on board the _San Jacinto_ they\r\nwere treated more like guests on a private yacht, having \"seats at the\r\ncaptain's table,\" than as enemy prisoners on an American war-ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wilkes had acted without orders, and, indeed, even without any\r\nrecent official information from Washington. He was returning from a\r\ncruise off the African coast, and had reached St. Thomas on October 10.\r\nA few days later, when off the south coat of Cuba, he had learned of the\r\nConfederate appointment of Mason and Slidell, and on the twenty-eighth,\r\nin Havana harbour, he heard that the Commissioners were to sail on the\r\n_Trent_. At once he conceived the idea of intercepting the _Trent_,\r\nexercising the right of search, and seizing the envoys, in spite of the\r\nalleged objections of his executive officer, Lieutenant Fairfax. The\r\nresult was that quite without authority from the United States Navy\r\nDepartment, and solely upon his own responsibility, a challenge was\r\naddressed to Britain, the \"mistress of the seas,\" certain to be accepted\r\nby that nation as an insult to national prestige and national pride not\r\nquietly to be suffered.\r\n\r\nThe _San Jacinto_ reached Fortress Monroe on the evening of November 15.\r\nThe next day the news was known, but since it was Saturday, few papers\r\ncontained more than brief and inaccurate accounts and, there being then\r\nfew Sunday papers, it was not until Monday, the eighteenth, that there\r\nbroke out a widespread rejoicing and glorification in the Northern\r\npress[403]. America, for a few days, passed through a spasm of\r\nexultation hard to understand, even by those who felt it, once the first\r\nemotion had subsided. This had various causes, but among them is evident\r\na quite childish fear of the acuteness and abilities of Mason and\r\nSlidell. Both men were indeed persons of distinction in the politics of\r\nthe previous decades. Mason had always been open in his expressed\r\nantipathy to the North, especially to New England, had long been a\r\nleader in Virginia, and at the time of the Southern secession, was a\r\nUnited States Senator from that State. Slidell, a Northerner by birth,\r\nbut early removed to Louisiana, had acquired fortune in business there,\r\nand had for nearly twenty years been the political \"boss\" of one faction\r\nof the Democratic Party in New Orleans and in the State. With much\r\nprevious experience in diplomacy, especially that requiring intrigue and\r\nindirect methods (as in the preliminaries of the Mexican War), and\r\nhaving held his seat in the United States Senate until the withdrawal of\r\nLouisiana from the Union, he was, of the two men, more feared and more\r\ndetested, but both were thoroughly obnoxious to the North. Merely on the\r\npersonal side their capture was cause for wide rejoicing[404].\r\n\r\nSurprise was also an element in the American elation, for until the news\r\nof the capture was received no portion of the public had given serious\r\nthought to any attempt to stop the envoys. Surprise also played its part\r\nwhen the affair became known in England, though in official circles\r\nthere had been some warning. It had already been reported in the British\r\npress that Mason and Slidell had run the blockade at Charleston, were in\r\nCuba, and were about to set sail for England on the Confederate steamer\r\n_Nashville_, but the British Government, considering that the envoys\r\nmight perhaps sail rather on the West India Mail Steamer for\r\nSouthampton, became much concerned over a possible American interference\r\nwith that vessel. On November 9 Hammond sent an urgent enquiry to the\r\nAdvocate-General stating the situation, calling attention to the\r\npresence at Southampton of an American war-vessel, and asking whether\r\nthis vessel, or any other American man-of-war, \"would be entitled to\r\ninterfere with the mail steamer if fallen in with beyond the territorial\r\nlimits of the United Kingdom, that is beyond three miles from the\r\nBritish Coast.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Handy, Washington_ JAMES M. MASON]\r\n\r\n     \"Whether for instance she might cause the West India Mail\r\n     Steamer to bring to, might board her, examine her Papers,\r\n     open the Mail Bags and examine the contents thereof, examine\r\n     the luggage of passengers, seize and carry away Messrs. Mason\r\n     and Slidell in person, or seize their Credentials and\r\n     Instructions and Despatches, or even put a Prize Crew on\r\n     board the West India Steamer and carry her off to a Port of\r\n     the United States; in other words what would be the right of\r\n     the American Cruiser with regard to her passengers and crew\r\n     and lawful papers and correspondence on board our packet on\r\n     the assumption that the said packet was liable to capture and\r\n     confiscation on the ground of carrying enemies' despatches;\r\n     would the Cruiser be entitled to carry the packet and all and\r\n     everything in her back to America or would she be obliged to\r\n     land in this Country or in some near port all the people and\r\n     all the unseizable goods[405]?\"\r\n\r\nHammond further stated that Russell was anxious to have an immediate\r\nreply, inasmuch as the mail packet was due to arrive in Southampton on\r\nNovember 12. The opinion of the law officer consulted is best given in\r\nPalmerston's own words in a letter to Delane, Editor of the _Times_:\r\n\r\n     \"_94 Piccadilly,\r\n     November 11, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR DELANE,\r\n\r\n     \"It may be useful to you to know that the Chancellor, Dr.\r\n     Lushington, the three Law Officers, Sir G. Grey, the Duke of\r\n     Somerset, and myself, met at the Treasury to-day to consider\r\n     what we could properly do about the American cruiser come, no\r\n     doubt, to search the West Indian packet supposed to be\r\n     bringing hither the two Southern envoys; and, much to my\r\n     regret, it appeared that, according to the principles of\r\n     international law laid down in our courts by Lord Stowell,\r\n     and practised and enforced by us, a belligerent has a right\r\n     to stop and search any neutral not being a ship of war, and\r\n     being found on the high seas and being suspected of carrying\r\n     enemy's despatches; and that consequently this American\r\n     cruiser might, by our own principles of international law,\r\n     stop the West Indian packet, search her, and if the Southern\r\n     men and their despatches and credentials were found on board,\r\n     either take them out, or seize the packet and carry her back\r\n     to New York for trial. Such being the opinion of our men\r\n     learned in the law, we have determined to do no more than to\r\n     order the _Phaeton_ frigate to drop down to Yarmouth Roads\r\n     and watch the proceedings of the American within our\r\n     three-mile limit of territorial jurisdiction, and to prevent\r\n     her from exercising within that limit those rights which we\r\n     cannot dispute as belonging to her beyond that limit.\r\n\r\n     \"In the meanwhile the American captain, having got very drunk\r\n     this morning at Southampton with some excellent brandy, and\r\n     finding it blow heavily at sea, has come to an anchor for the\r\n     night within Calshot Castle, at the entrance of the\r\n     Southampton river.\r\n\r\n     \"I mention these things for your private information.\r\n\r\n     Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     PALMERSTON[406].\"\r\n\r\nNot completely satisfied with this decision as reported to Delane, and\r\nsincerely anxious to avert what he foresaw would be a difficult\r\nsituation, Palmerston took the unusual step of writing to Adams on the\r\nnext day, November 12, and asking for an interview. His note took Adams\r\nby surprise, but he promptly waited upon Palmerston, and was told of the\r\nlatter's disturbance at the presence of the American ship _James Adger_,\r\nCaptain Marchand commanding, in Southampton Harbour, with the alleged\r\npurpose of stopping the British West India steamer and intercepting the\r\njourney of Mason and Slidell. Palmerston stated that he \"did not pretend\r\nto judge absolutely of the question whether we had a right to stop a\r\nforeign vessel for such a purpose as was indicated,\" and he urged on\r\nAdams the unwisdom of such an act in any case. \"Neither did the object\r\nto be gained seem commensurate with the risk. For it was surely of no\r\nconsequence whether one or two more men were added to the two or three\r\nwho had already been so long here. They would scarcely make a difference\r\nin the action of the Government after once having made up its\r\nmind[407].\"\r\n\r\nThe interview with Adams, so Palmerston wrote to Delane on the same day,\r\nNovember 12, was reassuring:\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR DELANE,\r\n\r\n     \"I have seen Adams to-day, and he assures me that the\r\n     American paddle-wheel was sent to intercept the _Nashville_\r\n     if found in these seas, but not to meddle with any ship under\r\n     a foreign flag. He said he had seen the commander, and had\r\n     advised him to go straight home; and he believed the steamer\r\n     to be now on her way back to the United States. This is a\r\n     very satisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\n     Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     PALMERSTON[408].\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, neither Adams' diary nor his report to Seward recorded quite\r\nthe same statement as that here attributed to him by Palmerston, and\r\nthis became later, but fortunately after the question of the _Trent_ had\r\npassed off the stage, a matter of minor dispute. Adams' own statement\r\nwas that he had told Palmerston the _James Adger_ was seeking to\r\nintercept the _Nashville_ and \"had no instruction\" to interfere with a\r\nBritish Packet--which is not the same as saying that she already had\r\ninstructions \"not to meddle with any ship under a foreign flag[409].\"\r\nBut in any case, it would appear that the British Government had been\r\nwarned by its legal advisers that if that which actually happened in the\r\ncase of the _Trent_ should occur, English practice, if followed, would\r\ncompel acquiescence in it[410]. This is not to say that a first legal\r\nadvice thus given on a problematical case necessarily bound the\r\nGovernment to a fixed line of action, but that the opinion of the\r\nGovernment was one of \"no help for it\" if the case should actually arise\r\nis shown by the instructions to Lyons and by his reaction. On November\r\n16, Hammond wrote to Lyons stating the opinion of the Law Officers that\r\n\"we could do nothing to save the Packet being interfered with outside\r\nour three miles; so Lord Palmerston sent for Adams, who assured him that\r\nthe American [the _James Adger_] had no instructions to meddle with any\r\nship under English colours ... that her orders were not to endeavour to\r\ntake Mason and Slidell out of any ship under foreign colours[411].\" On\r\nreceipt of this letter subsequent to the actual seizure of the envoys,\r\nLyons hardly knew what to expect. He reported Hammond's account to\r\nAdmiral Milne, writing that the legal opinion was that \"Nothing could be\r\ndone to save the Packet's being interfered with outside of the Marine\r\nleague from the British Coast\"; but he added, \"I am not informed that\r\nthe Law Officers decided that Mason and Slidell might be taken out of\r\nthe Packet, but only that we could not prevent the Packet's being\r\ninterfered with,\" thus previsioning that shift in British legal opinion\r\nwhich was to come _after_ the event. Meanwhile Lyons was so uncertain as\r\nto what his instructions would be that he thought he \"ought to maintain\r\nthe greatest reserve here on the matter of the _Trent_[412].\"\r\n\r\nThis British anxiety and the efforts to prevent a dangerous complication\r\noccurred after the envoys had been seized but some two weeks before that\r\nfact was known in London. \"Adams,\" wrote Russell, \"says it was all a\r\nfalse alarm, and wonders at our susceptibility and exaggerated\r\nnotions[413].\" But Russell was not equally convinced with Adams that the\r\nNorth, especially Seward, was so eager for continued British\r\nneutrality, and when, on November 27, the news of Captain Wilkes' action\r\nwas received, Russell and many others in the Cabinet saw in it a\r\ncontinuation of unfriendly Northern policy now culminating in a direct\r\naffront. Argyll, the most avowed friend of the North in the Cabinet, was\r\nstirred at first to keen resentment, writing \"of this wretched piece of\r\nAmerican folly.... I am all against submitting to any clean breach of\r\nInternational Law, such as I can hardly doubt this has been[414].\" The\r\nLaw Officers now held that \"Captain Wilkes had undertaken to pass upon\r\nthe issue of a violation of neutrality on the spot, instead of sending\r\nthe _Trent_ as a prize into port for judicial adjudication[415].\" This\r\nwas still later further expanded by an opinion that the envoys could not\r\nbe considered as contraband, and thus subject to capture nor the _Trent_\r\nas having violated neutrality, since the destination of the vessel was\r\nto a neutral, not to an enemy port[416]. This opinion would have\r\nprohibited even the carrying of the _Trent_ into an American port for\r\ntrial by a prize court.\r\n\r\nBut the British Government did not argue the matter in its demand upon\r\nthe United States. The case was one for a quick demand of prompt\r\nreparation. Russell's instruction to Lyons, sent on November 30, was\r\ncouched in coldly correct language, showing neither a friendly nor an\r\nunfriendly attitude. The seizure of the envoys was asserted to be a\r\nbreach of international law, which, it was hoped, had occurred without\r\norders, and Lyons was to demand the restoration of the prisoners with an\r\napology. If Seward had not already offered these terms Lyons was to\r\npropose them, but as a preliminary step in making clear the British\r\nposition, he might read the instruction to Seward, leaving him a copy\r\nof it if desired[417]. In another instruction of the same date Russell\r\nauthorized a delay of seven days in insisting upon an answer by Seward,\r\nif the latter wished it, and gave Lyons liberty to determine whether\r\n\"the requirements of Her Majesty's Government are substantially complied\r\nwith[418].\" And on December 1, Russell writing privately to Lyons\r\ninstructed him, while upholding English dignity, to abstain from\r\nanything like menace[419]. On November 30, also, the Government\r\nhurriedly sent out orders to hold the British Fleet in readiness, began\r\npreparations for the sending of troops to Canada, and initiated\r\nmunitions and supply activities. Evidently there was at first but faint\r\nhope that a break in relations, soon to be followed by war, was to be\r\navoided[420].\r\n\r\nIt has long been known to history, and was known to Adams almost\r\nimmediately, that the first draft of the instruction to Lyons was\r\nsoftened in language by the advice of Prince Albert, the material point\r\nbeing the expression of a hope that the action of Captain Wilkes was\r\nunauthorized[421]. That instruction had been sent previous to the\r\nreceipt of a report from Lyons in which, very fearful of results, he\r\nstated that, waiting instructions, he would preserve a strict\r\nsilence[422]. Equally anxious was Cowley at Paris, who feared the\r\nrealization of Seward's former \"foreign war panacea.\" \"I wish I could\r\ndivest myself of the idea that the North and South will not shake hands\r\nover a war with us[423].\" Considering the bitterness of the quarrel in\r\nAmerica this was a far-fetched notion. The efforts promptly made by the\r\nConfederate agents in London to make use of the _Trent_ affair showed\r\nhow little Cowley understood the American temper. Having remained very\r\nquiet since August when Russell had informed them that Great Britain\r\nintended remaining strictly neutral[424], they now, on November 27 and\r\n30, renewed their argument and application for recognition, but received\r\nin reply a curt letter declining any official communication with them\r\n\"in the present state of affairs[425].\"\r\n\r\nThe delay of at least three weeks imposed by methods of transportation\r\nbefore even the first American reaction to the British demand could be\r\nreceived in London gave time for a lessening of excitement and a more\r\ncareful self-analysis by British statesmen as to what they really felt\r\nand desired. Gladstone wrote: \"It is a very sad and heart-sickening\r\nbusiness, and I sincerely trust with you that war may be averted[426].\"\r\nArgyll hurried home from the Continent, being much disturbed by the tone\r\nof the British press, and stating that he was against standing on\r\ntechnical grounds of international law. \"War with America is such a\r\ncalamity that we must do all we can to avoid it. It involves not only\r\nourselves, but all our North American colonies[427].\" But war seemed to\r\nboth men scarcely avoidable, an opinion held also by Cornewall\r\nLewis[428] and by Clarendon, the latter standing at the moment in a\r\nposition midway between the Whig and Tory parties[429]. Yet Russell,\r\nwith more cause than others to mistrust Seward's policy, as also\r\nbelieving that he had more cause, personally, to resent it, was less\r\npessimistic and was already thinking of at least postponing immediate\r\nhostilities in the event of an American refusal to make just recompense.\r\nOn December 16 he wrote to Palmerston: \"I incline more and more to the\r\nopinion that if the answer is a reasoning, and not a blunt offensive\r\nanswer, we should send once more across the Atlantic to ask\r\ncompliance.... I do not think the country would approve an immediate\r\ndeclaration of war. But I think we must abide by our demand of a\r\nrestoration of the prisoners.... Lyons gives a sad account of Canada.\r\nYour foresight of last year is amply justified[430].\" And on December 20\r\nhe wrote, \"Adams' language yesterday was entirely in favour of yielding\r\nto us, if our tone is not too peremptory.... If our demands are\r\nrefused, we must, of course, call Parliament together. The sixth\r\nof February will do. In any other case we must decide according to\r\ncircumstances[431].\"\r\n\r\nThus Russell would not have Great Britain go to war with America without\r\nthe sanction of Parliament, and was seeking reasons for delay. He was\r\nreacting, in fact, to a more sobering second thought which was\r\nexperienced also by nearly everyone, save the eager British\r\n\"Southerner,\" in public and in newspaper circles. The first explosion of\r\nthe Press, on receipt of the news of the _Trent_, had been a terrific\r\none. The British lion, insulted in its chosen field of supremacy, the\r\nsea, had pawed the air in frenzy though at first preserving a certain\r\nslow dignity of motion. Customary \"strong leader-writing\" became\r\nvigorous, indeed, in editorial treatment of America and in demand for\r\nthe prompt release of the envoys with suitable apology. The close touch\r\nof leading papers with Governmental opinion is well shown, as in the\r\n_Times_, by the day-to-day editorials of the first week. On November 28\r\nthere was solemn and anxious consideration of a grave crisis with much\r\nquestioning of international law, which was acknowledged to be doubtful.\r\nBut even if old British practice seemed to support Captain Wilkes, the\r\npresent was not to be controlled by a discarded past, and \"essential\r\ndifferences\" were pointed out. This tone of vexed uncertainty changed to\r\na note of positive assurance and militant patriotism on November 30 when\r\nthe Government made its demand. The _Times_ up to December 2, thought it\r\nabsolutely certain that Wilkes had acted on authorization, and devoted\r\nmuch space to Seward as the evil genius of American warlike policy\r\ntoward England. The old \"Duke of Newcastle story\" was revamped. But on\r\nDecember 2 there reached London the first, very brief, American news of\r\nthe arrival of the _San Jacinto_ at Fortress Monroe, and this contained\r\na positive statement by Wilkes that he had had no orders. The _Times_\r\nwas sceptical, but printed the news as having an important bearing, if\r\ntrue, and, at the same time, printed communications by \"Justicia\" and\r\nothers advising a \"go slowly\" policy[432]. Yet all British papers\r\nindulged in sharp reflections on American insults, displayed keen\r\nresentment, and demanded a prompt yielding to the Governmental demand.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent American long resident in London, wrote to Seward on\r\nNovember 29: \"There never was within memory such a burst of feeling as\r\nhas been created by the news of the boarding of [the Trent]. The people\r\nare frantic with rage, and were the country polled, I fear 999 men out\r\nof a thousand would declare for immediate war. Lord Palmerston cannot\r\nresist the impulse if he would.\" And another American, in Edinburgh,\r\nwrote to his uncle in New York: \"I have never seen so intense a feeling\r\nof indignation exhibited in my life. It pervades all classes, and may\r\nmake itself heard above the wiser theories of the Cabinet\r\nofficers[433].\" If such were the British temper, it would require\r\nskilful handling by even a pacific-minded Government to avoid war. Even\r\nwithout belligerent newspaper utterances the tone of arrogance as in\r\n_Punch's_ cartoon, \"You do what's right, my son, or I'll blow you out of\r\nthe water,\" portended no happy solution. Yet this cartoon at least\r\nimplied a hope of peaceful outcome, and that this was soon a general\r\nhope is shown by the prompt publicity given to a statement from the\r\nAmerican General, Winfield Scott, in Paris, denying that he had said the\r\naction of Captain Wilkes had been decided upon at Washington before he\r\nsailed for Europe, and asserting that no orders were given to seize the\r\nenvoys on board any British or foreign vessel[434]. Nevertheless, Adams,\r\nfor the moment intensely aroused, and suspicious of the whole purpose of\r\nBritish policy, could write to his friend Dana in Boston: \"The\r\nexpression of the past summer might have convinced you that she [Great\r\nBritain] was not indifferent to the disruption of the Union. In May she\r\ndrove in the tip of the wedge, and now you can't imagine that a few\r\nspiders' webs of a half a century back will not be strong enough to hold\r\nher from driving it home. Little do you understand of this fast-anchored\r\nisle[435].\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that one cause of a more bitter and sharper tone\r\nin the British press was the reception of the counter-exultation of the\r\nAmerican press on learning of the detention and the exercise of \"right\r\nof search\" on a British ship. The American public equally went \"off its\r\nhead\" in its expressions. Writing in 1911, the son of the American\r\nMinister to Great Britain, Charles Francis Adams, jun., in 1861, a young\r\nlaw-student in Boston, stated: \"I do not remember in the whole course of\r\nthe half-century's retrospect ... any occurrence in which the American\r\npeople were so completely swept off their feet, for the moment losing\r\npossession of their senses, as during the weeks which immediately\r\nfollowed the seizure of Mason and Slidell[436].\" There were evident two\r\nprincipal causes for this elation. The North with much emotion and high\r\ncourage entering in April, 1861, upon the task of restoring the Union\r\nand hoping for quick success, had now passed through a wearisome six\r\nmonths with no evident progress towards its object. Northern failure had\r\ndeveloped a deep mortification when, suddenly and unexpectedly, a bold\r\nnaval captain, on his own initiative, appeared to have struck a real\r\nblow at the South. His action seemed to indicate that the fighting\r\nforces of the North, if free from the trammels of Washington red tape,\r\ncould, and would, carry on energetic war. Certainly it was but a slight\r\nincident to create such Northern emotion, yet the result was a sudden\r\nlifting from despondency to elation.\r\n\r\nBut almost equally with this cause of joy there operated on American\r\nminds the notion that the United States had at last given to Great\r\nBritain a dose of her own medicine in a previous era--had exercised upon\r\na British ship that \"right of search\" which had been so keenly resented\r\nby America as to have become almost a _permanent_ cause of a sense of\r\ninjury once received and never to be forgotten. There was no clear\r\nthinking about this; the obnoxious right of search in times of peace for\r\nvagrant seamen, the belligerent right exercised by Britain while America\r\nwas a neutral, the practice of a \"right of visit\" claimed by Britain as\r\nnecessary in suppression of the African Slave Trade--all were confused\r\nby the American public (as they are still in many history textbooks to\r\nthis day), and the total result of this mixing of ideas was a general\r\nAmerican jubilation that the United States had now revenged herself for\r\nBritish offences, in a manner of which Great Britain could not\r\nconsistently complain. These two main reasons for exultation were shared\r\nby all classes, not merely by the uninformed mob of newspaper readers.\r\nAt a banquet tendered Captain Wilkes in Boston on November 26, Governor\r\nAndrews of Massachusetts called Wilkes' action \"one of the most\r\nillustrious services that had made the war memorable,\" and added \"that\r\nthere might be nothing left [in the episode] to crown the exultation of\r\nthe American heart, Commodore Wilkes fired his shot across the bows of\r\nthe ship that bore the British lion at its head[437].\"\r\n\r\nAll America first applauded the act, then plunged into discussion of its\r\nlegality as doubts began to arise of its defensibility--and wisdom. It\r\nbecame a sort of temporarily popular \"parlour game\" to argue the\r\ninternational law of the case and decide that Great Britain could have\r\nno cause of complaint[438]. Meanwhile at Washington itself there was\r\nevidenced almost equal excitement and approval--but not, fortunately, by\r\nthe Department responsible for the conduct of foreign relations.\r\nSecretary of the Navy Welles congratulated Wilkes on his \"great public\r\nservice,\" though criticizing him for not having brought the _Trent_ into\r\nport for adjudication. Congress passed a joint resolution, December 2,\r\nthanking Wilkes for his conduct, and the President was requested to give\r\nhim a gold medal commemorative of his act. Indeed, no evidence of\r\napprobation was withheld save the formal approval and avowal of national\r\nresponsibility by the Secretary of State, Seward. On him, therefore, and\r\non the wisdom of men high in the confidence of the Cabinet, like Sumner,\r\nLyons pinned his faint hope of a peaceful solution. Thoroughly alarmed\r\nand despondent, anxious as to the possible fate of Canada[439], he\r\nadvised against any public preparations in Canada for defence, on the\r\nground that if the _Trent_ affair did blow over it should not appear\r\nthat we ever thought it an insult which would endanger peace[440]. This\r\nwas very different from the action and attitude of the Government at\r\nhome, as yet unknown to Lyons. He wisely waited in silence, advising\r\nlike caution to others, until the receipt of instructions. Silence, at\r\nthe moment, was also a friendly service to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe earliest American reactions, the national rejoicing, became known to\r\nthe British press some six days after its own spasm of anger, and three\r\ndays after the Government had despatched its demand for release of the\r\nprisoners and begun its hurried military preparations. On December 3 the\r\n_Times_ contained the first summary of American press outpourings. The\r\nfirst effect in England was astonishment, followed by renewed and more\r\nintense evidences of a belligerent disposition. Soon, however, there\r\nbegan to appear a note of caution and more sane judgment of the\r\nsituation, though with no lessening of the assertion that Britain had\r\nsuffered an injury that must be redressed. The American frenzy of\r\ndelight seemingly indicated a deep-seated hostility to Britain that gave\r\npause to British clamour for revenge. On December 4 John Bright made a\r\ngreat speech at Rochdale, arguing a possible British precedent for\r\nWilkes' act, urging caution, lauding American leadership in democracy,\r\nand stating his positive conviction that the United States Government\r\nwas as much astonished as was that of Great Britain by the attack on the\r\n_Trent._[441] To this the _Times_ gave a full column of report on\r\nDecember 5 and the day following printed five close-type columns of the\r\nspeech itself. Editorially it attacked Bright's position, belittling the\r\nspeech for having been made at the one \"inconspicuous\" place where the\r\norator would be sure of a warm welcome, and asking why Manchester or\r\nLiverpool had not been chosen. In fact, however, the _Times_ was\r\nattempting to controvert \"our ancient enemy\" Bright as an apostle of\r\ndemocracy rather than to fan the flames of irritation over the _Trent_,\r\nand the prominence given to Bright's speech indicates a greater\r\nreadiness to consider as hopeful an escape from the existing crisis.\r\n\r\nAfter December 3 and up to the ninth, the _Times_ was more caustic about\r\nAmerica than previously. The impression of its editorials read to-day is\r\nthat more hopeful of a peaceful solution it was more free to snarl. But\r\nwith the issue of December 10 there began a series of leaders and\r\ncommunications, though occasionally with a relapse to the former tone,\r\ndistinctly less irritating to Americans, and indicating a real desire\r\nfor peace[442]. Other newspapers either followed the _Times_, or were\r\nslightly in advance of it in a change to more considerate and peaceful\r\nexpressions. Adams could write to Seward on December 6 that he saw no\r\nchange in the universality of the British demand for satisfaction of the\r\n\"insult and injury thought to be endured,\" but he recognized in the next\r\nfew days that a slow shift was taking place in the British temper and\r\nregretted the violence of American utterances. December 12, he wrote to\r\nhis son in America: \"It has given us here an indescribably sad feeling\r\nto witness the exultation in America over an event which bids fair to be\r\nthe final calamity in this contest....\" Great Britain \"is right in\r\nprinciple and only wrong in point of consistency. Our mistake is that we\r\nare donning ourselves in her cast-off suit, when our own is better worth\r\nwearing[443].\" His secretarial son was more vehement: \"Angry and hateful\r\nas I am of Great Britain, I still can't help laughing and cursing at the\r\nsame time as I see the accounts of the talk of our people. What a bloody\r\nset of fools they are! How in the name of all that's conceivable could\r\nyou suppose that England would sit quiet under such an insult. _We_\r\nshould have jumped out of our boots at such a one[444].\"\r\n\r\nThe British Cabinet members were divided in sentiments of hope or\r\npessimism as to the outcome, and were increasingly anxious for an\r\nhonourable escape from a possible situation in which, if they trusted\r\nthe observations of Lyons, they might find themselves aiding a slave as\r\nagainst a free State. On November 29, Lyons had written a long account\r\nof the changes taking place in Northern feeling as regards slavery. He\r\nthought it very probable that the issue of emancipation would soon be\r\nforced upon Lincoln, and that the American conflict would then take on a\r\nnew and more ideal character[445]. This letter, arriving in the midst of\r\nuncertainty about the _Trent_ solution, was in line with news published\r\nin the British papers calling out editorials from them largely in\r\ndisapproval[446]. Certainly Russell was averse to war. If the prisoners\r\nwere not given up, what, he asked, ought England then to do? Would it be\r\nwise to delay hostilities or to begin them at once?\r\n\r\n\"An early resort to hostilities will enable us at once to raise the\r\nblockade of the South, to blockade the North, and to prevent the egress\r\nof numerous ships, commissioned as privateers which will be sent against\r\nour commerce.\" But then, there was Canada, at present not defensible. He\r\nhad been reading Alison on the War of 1812, and found that then the\r\nAmerican army of invasion had numbered but 2,500 men. \"We may now expect\r\n40 or 50,000[447].\" Two days later he wrote to Gladstone that if America\r\nwould only \"let the Commissioners free to go where they pleased,\" he\r\nwould be satisfied. He added that in that case, \"I should be very glad\r\nto make a treaty with the U.S., giving up our pretensions of 1812 and\r\nsecuring immunity to persons not in arms on board neutral vessels or to\r\npersons going bona fide from one neutral port to another. This would be\r\na triumph to the U.S. in principle while the particular case would be\r\ndecided in our favour[448].\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 14, the Prince Consort died. It was well-known\r\nthat he had long been a brake upon the wheel of Palmerston's foreign\r\npolicy and, to the initiated, his last effort in this direction--the\r\nmodification of the instruction to Lyons on the _Trent_--was no secret.\r\nThere is no evidence that his death made any change in the British\r\nposition, but it was true, as the American Minister wrote, that \"Now\r\nthey [the British public] are beginning to open their eyes to a sense of\r\nhis value. They discover that much of their political quietude has been\r\ndue to the judicious exercise of his influence over the Queen and the\r\nCourt, and they do not conceal their uneasiness as to the future without\r\nhim[449].\" The nation was plunged into deep mourning, but not to\r\ndistraction from the American crisis, for on the day when all papers\r\nwere black with mourning borders, December 16, they printed the news of\r\nthe approval of Wilkes by the United States Congress, and gave a summary\r\nof Lincoln's message of December 2, which, to their astonishment, made\r\nno mention of the _Trent_ affair. The Congressional approval caused\r\n\"almost a feeling of consternation among ourselves,\" but Lincoln's\r\nsilence, it was argued, might possibly be taken as a good omen, since it\r\nmight indicate that he had as yet reached no decision[450]. Evidently\r\nthere was more real alarm caused by the applause given Wilkes by one\r\nbranch of the government than by the outpourings of the American press.\r\nThe next day several papers printed Lincoln's message in full and the\r\n_Times_ gave a long editorial analysis, showing much spleen that he had\r\nignored the issue with Great Britain[451]. On the eighteenth this\r\njournal also called attention, in a column and a half editorial, to the\r\nreport of the American Secretary of War, expressing astonishment, not\r\nunmixed with anxiety, at the energy which had resulted in the increase\r\nof the army to 700,000 men in less than nine months. The _Times_\r\ncontinued, even increased, its \"vigour\" of utterance on the _Trent_, but\r\ndevoted most of its energy to combating the suggestions, now being made\r\nvery generally, advocating a recourse to arbitration. This would be\r\n\"weak concession,\" and less likely to secure redress and peace for the\r\nfuture, than an insistence on the original demands.\r\n\r\nStatesmen also were puzzled by Lincoln's silence. Milner Gibson wrote\r\nthat \"even though Lyons should come away, I think the dispute may after\r\nall be settled without war[452].\" Cornewall Lewis thought the \"last mail\r\nfrom America is decidedly threatening, not encouraging[453].\" But on\r\nDecember 19, Adams was at last able to give Russell official assurance\r\nthat Wilkes had acted without authorization. Russell at once informed\r\nLyons of this communication and that he had now told Adams the exact\r\nterms of his two instructions to Lyons of November 30. He instructed\r\nLyons to accept in place of an apology an explanation that Wilkes'\r\naction was unauthorized--a very important further British modification,\r\nbut one which did not reach Lyons until after the conclusion of the\r\naffair at Washington[454]. Meanwhile a notable change had taken place in\r\nAmerican public expressions. It now regarded \"the Wilkes affair\r\nunfavourably, and would much prefer it had not occurred at all[455],\" a\r\nreaction without question almost wholly caused by the knowledge of the\r\nBritish demand and the unanimous support given it by the British\r\npublic[456]. On Great Britain the alteration in the American tone\r\nproduced less effect than might have been expected, and this because of\r\nthe persistent fear and suspicion of Seward. His voice, it was felt,\r\nwould in the end be the determining one, and if British belief that he\r\nhad long sought an occasion for war was correct, this surely was the\r\ntime when he could be confident of popular support. Thurlow Weed,\r\nSeward's most intimate political adviser, was now in London and\r\nattempted to disabuse the British public through the columns of the\r\n_Times_. His communication was printed, but his assertion that Seward's\r\nunfriendly utterances, beginning with the \"Newcastle story,\" were\r\nmisunderstood, did not convince the _Times_, which answered him at\r\nlength[457], and asserted its belief \"... that upon his ability to\r\ninvolve the United States in a war with England, Mr. Seward has staked\r\nhis official, and, most probably, also his political existence.\" The\r\nDuke of Newcastle's report of Seward's remarks, wrote George Peabody\r\nlater, \"has strongly influenced the Government in war preparations for\r\nseveral months past[458].\" Adams himself, though convinced that Seward's\r\nsupposed animosity \"was a mistake founded on a bad joke of his to the\r\nDuke of Newcastle,\" acknowledged that: \"The Duke has, however,\r\nsucceeded in making everybody in authority here believe it[459].\" Surely\r\nno \"joke\" to an Englishman ever so plagued an American statesman; but\r\nBritish Ministers founded their suspicions on far more serious reasons,\r\nas previously related[460].\r\n\r\nAs time passed without an answer from America, British speculation\r\nturned to estimates of the probable conditions of a war. These were not\r\nreassuring since even though postulating a British victory, it appeared\r\ninevitable that England would not escape without considerable damage\r\nfrom the American navy and from privateers. Americans were \"a powerful\r\nand adventurous people, strong in maritime resources, and participating\r\nin our own national familiarity with the risks and dangers of the\r\ndeep[461].\" Englishmen must not think that a war would be fought only on\r\nthe shores of America and in Canada. The legal question was re-hashed\r\nand intelligent American vexation re-stated in three letters printed in\r\nthe _Daily News_ on December 25, 26 and 27, by W. W. Story, an artist\r\nresident in Rome, but known in England as the son of Justice Story,\r\nwhose fame as a jurist stood high in Great Britain[462]. By the last\r\nweek of the year Adams felt that the Ministry, at least, was eager to\r\nfind a way out: \"The Government here will not press the thing to an\r\nextreme unless they are driven to it by the impetus of the wave they\r\nhave themselves created[463].\" He greatly regretted the death of the\r\nPrince Consort who \"believed in the policy of conciliating the United\r\nStates instead of repelling them.\" On December 27, Adams wrote Seward:\r\n\"I think the signs are clear of a considerable degree of reaction.\" He\r\nalso explained the causes of the nearly unanimous European support of\r\nEngland in this contention: \"Unquestionably the view of all other\r\ncountries is that the opportunity is most fortunate for obtaining new\r\nand large modifications of international law which will hereafter\r\nmaterially restrain the proverbial tendency of this country on the\r\nocean[464].\"\r\n\r\nAdams' estimate was correct. Even the _Morning Post_, generally accepted\r\nas Palmerston's organ[465], and in the _Trent_ crisis the most\r\n'vigorous' of all metropolitan journals, commented upon the general\r\npublic hope of a peaceful solution, but asked on December 30, \"... can a\r\nGovernment [the American] elected but a few months since by the popular\r\nchoice, depending exclusively for existence on popular support, afford\r\nto disappoint the popular expectation? The answer to this question must,\r\nwe fear, be in the negative....\" The _Post_ (thereby Palmerston?) did\r\nindeed, as later charged, \"prolong the excitement,\" but not with its\r\nearlier animosity to America. The very fact that the _Post_ was accepted\r\nas Palmerston's organ justified this attitude for it would have been\r\nfolly for the Government to announce prematurely a result of which there\r\nwas as yet no definite assurance. Yet _within_ the Cabinet there was a\r\nmore hopeful feeling. Argyll believed Adams' statement to Russell of\r\nDecember 19 was practically conclusive[466], and Adams himself now\r\nthought that the prevalent idea was waning of an American plan to\r\ninflict persistent \"indignities\" on Britain: \"at least in this case\r\nnothing of the kind had been intended[467].\" Everyone wondered at and\r\nwas vexed with the delay of an answer from America, yet hopefully\r\nbelieved that this indicated ultimate yielding. There could be no\r\nsurety until the event. Russell wrote to Palmerston on January 7, \"I\r\nstill incline to think Lincoln will submit, but not until the clock is\r\n59 minutes past 11. If it is war, I fear we must summon Parliament\r\nforthwith[468].\"\r\n\r\nThe last moment for reply was indeed very nearly taken advantage of at\r\nWashington, but not to the full seven days permitted for consideration\r\nby Russell's November thirtieth instructions to Lyons. These were\r\nreceived on December 18, and on the next day Lyons unofficially\r\nacquainted Seward with their nature[469]. The latter expressed\r\ngratification with the \"friendly and conciliatory manner\" of Lyons and\r\nasked for two days' time for consideration. On Saturday, December 21,\r\ntherefore, Lyons again appeared to make a formal presentation of demands\r\nbut was met with a statement that the press of other business had\r\nprevented sufficient consideration and was asked for a further two days'\r\npostponement until Monday. Hence December 23 became the day from which\r\nthe seven days permitted for consideration and reply dated. In the\r\nmeantime, Mercier, on December 21, had told Seward of the strong support\r\ngiven by France to the British position.\r\n\r\nThe month that had elapsed since the American outburst on first learning\r\nof Wilkes' act had given time for a cooling of patriotic fever and for a\r\nsaner judgment. Henry Adams in London had written to his brother that if\r\nthe prisoners were not given up, \"this nation means to make war.\" To\r\nthis the brother in America replied \"this nation doesn't[470],\" an\r\nanswer that sums up public determination no matter how loud the talk or\r\ndeep the feeling. Seward understood the change and had now received\r\nstrong warnings from Adams and Weed in London, and from Dayton in\r\nParis[471], but these were not needed to convince him that America must\r\nyield. Apparently, he had recognized from the first that America was in\r\nan impossible situation and that the prisoners must be released _if the\r\ndemand were made_. The comment of those who were \"wise after the event\"\r\nwas that true policy would have dictated an immediate release of the\r\nprisoners as seized in violation of international law, before any\r\ncomplaint could be received from Great Britain. This leaves out of\r\nconsideration the political difficulties at home of an administration\r\nalready seriously weakened by a long-continued failure to \"press the\r\nwar,\" and it also fails to recognize that in the American Cabinet itself\r\na proposal by Seward to release, made immediately, would in all\r\nprobability have been negatived. Blair, in the Cabinet, and Sumner in\r\nthe Senate, were, indeed, in favour of prompt release, but Lincoln seems\r\nto have thought the prisoners must be held, even though he feared they\r\nmight become \"white elephants.\" All that Seward could do at first was to\r\nnotify Adams that Wilkes had acted without instructions[472].\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morning the Cabinet met to consider the answer to Great\r\nBritain. Sumner attended and read letters from Bright and Cobden,\r\nearnestly urging a yielding by America and depicting the strength of\r\nBritish feeling. Bright wrote: \"If you are resolved to succeed against\r\nthe South, _have no war with England_; make every concession that can be\r\nmade; don't even hesitate to tell the world _that you will even concede\r\nwhat two years ago no Power would have asked of you_, rather than give\r\nanother nation a pretence for assisting in the breaking up of your\r\ncountry[473].\" Without doubt Bright's letters had great influence on\r\nLincoln and on other Cabinet members, greatly aiding Seward, but that\r\nhis task was difficult is shown by the fact that an entire morning's\r\ndiscussion brought no conclusion. Adjournment was taken until the next\r\nday and after another long debate Seward had the fortune to persuade his\r\nassociates to a hearty unanimity on December 26. The American reply in\r\nthe form of a communication to Lyons was presented to him by Seward on\r\nthe 27th, and on that same day Lyons forwarded it to Russell. It did not\r\ncontain an apology, but Lyons wrote that since the prisoners were to be\r\nreleased and acknowledgment was made that reparation was due to Great\r\nBritain, he considered that British demands were \"so far substantially\r\ncomplied with\" that he should remain at his post until he received\r\nfurther orders[474].\r\n\r\nSeward's reply was immediately printed in the American papers. Lyons\r\nreported that it was very well received and that the public was calm and\r\napparently contented with the outcome[475]. He thought that \"thus the\r\npreparation for war ... has prevented war.\" Seward's argument reviewed\r\nat great length all the conditions of the incident, dilated on many\r\npoints of international law both relevant and irrelevant, narrated the\r\npast relations of the two nations on \"right of search,\" and finally took\r\nthe ground that Mason and Slidell were contraband of war and justly\r\nsubject to capture, but that Wilkes had erred in not bringing the\r\n_Trent_, with her passengers, into port for trial by an American prize\r\ncourt. Therefore the two envoys with their secretaries would be handed\r\nover promptly to such persons as Lyons might designate. It was, says\r\nSeward's biographer, not a great state paper, was defective in argument,\r\nand contained many contradictions[476], but, he adds, that it was\r\nintended primarily for the American public and to meet the situation at\r\nhome. Another critic sums up Seward's difficulties: he had to persuade a\r\nPresident and a reluctant Cabinet, to support the naval idol of the day,\r\nto reconcile a Congress which had passed resolutions highly commending\r\nWilkes, and to pacify a public earlier worked up to fever pitch[477].\r\nStill more important than ill-founded assertions about the nature of\r\ncontraband of war, a term not reconcilable with the _neutral port_\r\ndestination of the _Trent_, was the likening of Mason and Slidell to\r\n\"ambassadors of independent states.\" For eight months Seward had\r\nprotested to Europe \"that the Confederates were not belligerents, but\r\ninsurgents,\" and now \"his whole argument rested on the fact that they\r\nwere belligerents[478].... But this did not later alter a return to his\r\nold position nor prevent renewed arguments to induce a recall by\r\nEuropean states of their proclamations of neutrality.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of January 8, a telegram from Lyons was received in\r\nLondon, stating that the envoys would be released and the next day came\r\nhis despatch enclosing a copy of Seward's answer. The envoys themselves\r\ndid not reach England until January 30, and the delay in their voyage\r\ngave time for an almost complete disappearance of public interest in\r\nthem[479]. January 10, Russell instructed Lyons that Great Britain was\r\nwell satisfied with the fact and manner of the American answer, and\r\nregarded the incident as closed, but that it could not agree with\r\nportions of Seward's argument and would answer these later. This was\r\ndone on January 23, but the reply was mainly a mere formality and is of\r\ninterest only as revealing a further shift in the opinion of the legal\r\nadvisers, with emphasis on the question of what constitutes\r\ncontraband[480]. Possibly the British Government was embarrassed by the\r\nfact that while France had strongly supported England at Washington,\r\nThouvenel had told Cowley \"... that the conduct pursued by Capt. Wilkes,\r\nwhether the United States claimed to be considered as Belligerents, _or\r\nas a Government engaged in putting down a rebellion_, was a violation of\r\nall those principles of Maritime international law, which France had\r\never supported[481] ...\" and had instructed Mercier to so state to\r\nSeward. This implied a reflection on former British practice, especially\r\nas regards the exercise of a right of search to recover its own citizens\r\nand is indicative of the correctness of Adams' judgment that one main\r\nreason for European support of Great Britain in the _Trent_ crisis, was\r\nthe general desire to tie her to a limitation of belligerent\r\nmaritime power.\r\n\r\nIn notifying Russell of the release of the prisoners, Lyons had stated\r\nthat he would caution the Commander of the ship conveying them that they\r\nwere \"not to be received with honours or treated otherwise than as\r\ndistinguished _private_ gentlemen[482].\" Russell was equally cautious,\r\nseeing Mason, shortly after arrival in London, \"unofficially at my own\r\nhouse,\" on February 10, refusing to read his credentials, and after\r\nlistening to a statement of his instructions, replying that \"nothing had\r\nhitherto occurred which would justify or induce\" Great Britain to depart\r\nfrom a position of neutrality[483]. Russell had already suggested that\r\nThouvenel use the same method with Slidell[484]. This procedure does not\r\nnecessarily indicate a change in governmental attitude, for it is\r\nexactly in line with that pursued toward the Confederate Commissioners\r\nbefore the _Trent_; but the _Trent_ controversy might naturally have\r\nbeen expected to have brought about an _easier_ relation between Russell\r\nand a Southern representative. That it did not do so is evidence of\r\nRussell's care not to give offence to Northern susceptibilities. Also,\r\nin relief at the outcome of the _Trent_, he was convinced, momentarily\r\nat least, that the general British suspicion of Seward was unfounded. \"I\r\ndo not,\" he wrote to Gladstone, \"believe that Seward has any animosity\r\nto this country. It is all buncom\" (_sic_)[485]. Apparently it was\r\nbeginning to be realized by British statesmen that Seward's \"high tone\"\r\nwhich they had interpreted, with some justification earlier, as\r\nespecially inimical to England, now indicated a foreign policy based\r\nupon one object only--the restoration of the Union, and that in pursuit\r\nof this object he was but seeking to make clear to European nations that\r\nthe United States was still powerful enough to resent foreign\r\ninterference. The final decision in the _Trent_ affair, such was the\r\nsituation in the American Cabinet, rested on Seward alone and that\r\ndecision was, from the first, for peace.\r\n\r\nNor did Seward later hold any grudge over the outcome. America in\r\ngeneral, however, though breathing freely again as the war cloud passed,\r\nwas bitter. \"The feeling against Great Britain is of intense hatred and\r\nthe conclusion of the whole matter is, that we must give up the\r\ntraitors, put down the rebellion, increase our navy, perfect the\r\ndiscipline of the 600,000 men in the field, and then fight Great\r\nBritain[486].\" Lowell, in one of the most emotional of his \"Bigelow\r\nPapers,\" wrote, on January 6, 1862:\r\n\r\n     \"It don't seem hardly right, John,\r\n     When both my hands was full,\r\n     To stump me to a fight, John--\r\n     Your cousin, tu, John Bull!\r\n          Ole Uncle S., sez he, 'I guess\r\n     We know it now,' sez he,\r\n     'The lion's paw is all the law,\r\n     Accordin' to J.B.,\r\n     Thet's fit for you an' me[487]!'\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the demand itself for the release of Mason and Slidell that\r\nin the end so stirred America as the warlike tone of the British press\r\nand the preparations of the Government. Even after their surrender\r\nAmerica was further incensed by British boasting that America had\r\nyielded to a threat of war, as in the _Punch_ cartoon of a penitent\r\nsmall boy, Uncle Sam, who \"says he is very sorry and that he didn't mean\r\nto do it,\" and so escapes the birching Britannia was about to\r\nadminister. America had, in all truth, yielded to a threat, but disliked\r\nbeing told so, and regarded the threat itself as evidence of British\r\nill-will[488]. This was long the attitude of the American public.\r\n\r\nIn England the knowledge of America's decision caused a great national\r\nsigh of relief, coupled with a determination to turn the cold shoulder\r\nto the released envoys. On January 11, the _Times_ recounted the earlier\r\ncareers of Mason and Slidell, and stated that these two \"more than any\r\nother men,\" were responsible for the traditional American \"insane\r\nprejudice against England,\" an assertion for which no facts were offered\r\nin proof, and one much overestimating the influence of Mason and Slidell\r\non American politics before secession. They were \"about the most\r\nworthless booty it would be possible to extract from the jaws of the\r\nAmerican lion ... So we do sincerely hope that our countrymen will not\r\ngive these fellows anything in the shape of an ovation.\" Continuing, the\r\n_Times_ argued:\r\n\r\n     \"What they and their secretaries are to do here passes our\r\n     conjecture. They are personally nothing to us. They must not\r\n     suppose, because we have gone to the very verge of a great\r\n     war to rescue them, that therefore they are precious in our\r\n     eyes. We should have done just as much to rescue two of their\r\n     own Negroes, and, had that been the object of the rescue, the\r\n     swarthy Pompey and Caesar would have had just the same right\r\n     to triumphal arches and municipal addresses as Messrs. Mason\r\n     and Slidell. So, please, British public, let's have none of\r\n     these things. Let the Commissioners come up quietly to town,\r\n     and have their say with anybody who may have time to listen\r\n     to them. For our part, we cannot see how anything they have\r\n     to tell can turn the scale of British duty and deliberation.\"\r\n\r\nThis complete reversal, not to say somersault, by the leading British\r\nnewspaper, was in line with public expressions from all sections save\r\nthe extreme pro-Southern. Adams was astonished, writing privately: \"The\r\nfirst effect of the surrender ... has been extraordinary. The current\r\nwhich ran against us with such extreme violence six weeks ago now seems\r\nto be going with equal fury in our favour[489].\" Officially on the same\r\nday he explained this to Seward as caused by a late development in the\r\ncrisis of a full understanding, especially \"among the quiet and\r\nreligious citizens of the middle classes,\" that if Great Britain did\r\nengage in war with the United States she would be forced to become the\r\nally of a \"slave-holding oligarchy[490].\"\r\n\r\nHere, in truth, lay the greatest cause of British anxiety during the\r\nperiod of waiting for an answer and of relief when that answer was\r\nreceived. If England and America became enemies, wrote Argyll, \"we\r\nnecessarily became virtually the _Allies_ of the _Scoundrelism_ of the\r\nSouth[491].\" Robert Browning, attempting to explain to his friend Story\r\nthe British attitude, declared that early in the war Britain was with\r\nthe North, expecting \"that the pure and simple rights [of anti-slavery]\r\nin the case would be declared and vigorously carried out without one let\r\nor stop,\" but that Lincoln's denial of emancipation as an object had\r\nlargely destroyed this sympathy. Browning thought this an excusable\r\nthough a mistaken judgment since at least: \"The _spirit_ of all of Mr.\r\nLincoln's acts is altogether against Slavery in the end[492].\" He\r\nassured Story that the latter was in error \"as to men's 'fury' here\": \"I\r\nhave not heard one man, woman or child express anything but dismay at\r\nthe prospect of being obliged to go to war on any grounds with\r\nAmerica[493].\" And after the affair was over he affirmed: \"The purpose\r\nof the North is also understood at last; ... there is no longer the\r\nnotion that 'Slavery has nothing to do with it[494].'\"\r\n\r\nA few extreme pro-Northern enthusiasts held public meetings and passed\r\nresolutions commending the \"statesmanlike ability and moderation of\r\nSeward,\" and rejoicing that Great Britain had not taken sides with a\r\nslave power[495]. In general, however, such sentiments were not\r\n_publicly_ expressed. That they were keenly felt, nevertheless, is\r\ncertain. During the height of the crisis, Anthony Trollope, then touring\r\nAmerica, even while sharing fully in the intense British indignation\r\nagainst Captain Wilkes, wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"These people speak our language, use our prayers, read our\r\n     books, are ruled by our laws, dress themselves in our image,\r\n     are warm with our blood. They have all our virtues; and their\r\n     vices are our own too, loudly as we call out against them.\r\n     They are our sons and our daughters, the source of our\r\n     greatest pride, and as we grow old they should be the staff\r\n     of our age. Such a war as we should now wage with the States\r\n     would be an unloosing of hell upon all that is best upon the\r\n     world's surface[496].\"\r\n\r\nThe expressions of men like Browning and Trollope may not indeed, be\r\nregarded as typical of either governmental or general public reactions.\r\nMuch more exactly and with more authority as representing that\r\nthoughtful opinion of which Adams wrote were the conclusions of John\r\nStuart Mill. In an article in _Fraser's Magazine_, February, 1862,\r\nmaking a strong plea for the North, he summarized British feeling about\r\nthe _Trent_:\r\n\r\n     \"We had indeed, been wronged. We had suffered an indignity,\r\n     and something more than an indignity, which, not to have\r\n     resented, would have been to invite a constant succession of\r\n     insults and injuries from the same and from every other\r\n     quarter. We could have acted no otherwise than we have done;\r\n     yet it is impossible to think, without something like a\r\n     shudder, from what we have escaped. We, the emancipators of\r\n     the slave--who have wearied every Court and Government in\r\n     Europe and America with our protests and remonstrances, until\r\n     we goaded them into at least ostensibly co-operating with us\r\n     to prevent the enslaving of the negro ... _we_ should have\r\n     lent a hand to setting up, in one of the most commanding\r\n     positions of the world, a powerful republic, devoted not only\r\n     to slavery, but to pro-slavery propagandism....\"\r\n\r\nNo such protestations of relief over escape from a possible alliance\r\nwith the South were made officially by the Government, or in a debate\r\nupon the _Trent_, February 6, when Parliament reassembled. In the Lords\r\nthe Earl of Shelburne thought that America should have made a frank and\r\nopen apology. The Earl of Derby twitted the United States with having\r\nyielded to force alone, but said the time \"had not yet come\" for\r\nrecognizing the Confederacy. Lord Dufferin expressed great friendship\r\nfor America and declared that Englishmen ought to make themselves better\r\ninformed of the real merits of the Civil War. Earl Granville, speaking\r\nfor the Government, laid stress upon the difficulties at home of the\r\nWashington administration in pacifying public opinion and asserted a\r\npersonal belief that strict neutrality was England's best policy,\r\n\"although circumstances may arise which may call for a different\r\ncourse.\" On the same day in the Commons the debate was of a like general\r\ntenor to that in the Lords, but Disraeli differed from his chief (Derby)\r\nin that he thought America had been placed in a very difficult position\r\nin which she had acted very honourably. Palmerston took much credit for\r\nthe energetic military preparations, but stated \"from that position of\r\nstrict neutrality, it is not our intention to depart \"--an important\r\ndeclaration if taken, as apparently it was not, as fixing a policy. In\r\nsubstance all speakers, whether Whig or Tory, praised the Government's\r\nstand, and expressed gratification with the peaceful outcome[497].\r\n\r\nA further debate on the _Trent_ was precipitated by Bright on February\r\n17, in connection with the estimates to cover the cost of the military\r\ncontingents sent to Canada. He asserted that England by generously\r\ntrusting to American honour, might have won her lasting friendship, and\r\nit is worthy of note that for the first time in any speech made by him\r\n_in Parliament_, Bright declared that the war was one for the abolition\r\nof slavery. Palmerston in reply made no comment on the matter of\r\nslavery, but energetically defended the military preparations as a\r\nnecessary precaution. Bright's speech was probably intended for American\r\nconsumption with the purpose of easing American ill-will, by showing\r\nthat even in Parliament there were those who disapproved of that show of\r\nforce to which America so much objected. He foresaw that this would long\r\nbe the basis of American bitterness. But Palmerston was undoubtedly\r\ncorrect in characterizing Bright's opinion as a \"solitary one.\" And\r\nlooked at from a distance of time it would seem that a British\r\nGovernment, impressed as it was with a sense of Seward's unfriendliness,\r\nwhich had not prepared for war when making so strong a demand for\r\nreparation, would have merited the heaviest condemnation. If Mill was\r\nright in stating that the demand for reparation was a necessity, then so\r\nalso were the military preparations.\r\n\r\nUpon the Government the _Trent_ acted to bring to a head and make more\r\nclear the British relation to the Civil War in America. By November,\r\n1861, the policy of strict neutrality adopted in May, had begun to be\r\nweakened for various reasons already recited--weakened not to the point\r\nof any Cabinet member's advocacy of change, but in a restlessness at the\r\nslow development of a solution in America. Russell was beginning to\r\n_think_, at least, of recognition of the Confederacy. This was clear to\r\nLyons who, though against such recognition, had understood the drift, if\r\nSchleiden is to be trusted, of Ministerial opinion. Schleiden reported\r\non December 31 that Lyons had expressed to him much pleasure at the\r\npeaceful conclusion of the _Trent_ affair, and had added, \"England will\r\nbe too generous not to postpone the recognition of the independence of\r\nthe South as long as possible after this experience[498].\" But the\r\n_Trent_ operated like a thunder-storm to clear the atmosphere. It\r\nbrought out plainly the practical difficulties and dangers, at least as\r\nregards Canada, of a war with America; it resulted in a weakening of the\r\nconviction that Seward was unfriendly; it produced from the British\r\npublic an even greater expression of relief, when the incident was\r\nclosed, than of anger when it occurred; and it created in a section of\r\nthat public a fixed belief, shared by at least one member of the\r\nCabinet, that the issue in America was that of slavery, in support of\r\nwhich England could not possibly take a stand.\r\n\r\nThis did not mean that the British Government, nor any large section of\r\nthe public, believed the North could conquer the South. But it did\r\nindicate a renewed vigour for the policy of neutrality and a\r\ndetermination not to get into war with America. Adams wrote to Seward,\r\n\"I am inclined to believe that the happening of the affair of the\r\n_Trent_ just when it did, with just the issue that it had, was rather\r\nopportune than otherwise[499].\" Hotze, the confidential agent of the\r\nConfederacy in London, stated, \"the _Trent_ affair has done us\r\nincalculable injury,\" Russell is now \"an avowed enemy of our\r\nnationality[500].\" Hotze was over-gloomy, but Russell himself declared\r\nto Lyons: \"At all events I am heart and soul a neutral ... what a fuss\r\nwe have had about these two men[501].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: The _Trent_ was the cause of the outpouring of more\r\ncontemporary articles and pamphlets and has been the subject of more\r\nhistorical writing later, than any other incident of diplomatic\r\nrelations between the United States and Great Britain during the Civil\r\nWar--possibly more than all other incidents combined. The account given\r\nin this chapter, therefore, is mainly limited to a brief statement of\r\nthe facts together with such new sidelights as are brought out by\r\nhitherto unknown letters of British statesman; to a summary of British\r\npublic attitude as shown in the press; and to an estimate of the _after\r\neffect_ of the _Trent_ on British policy. It would be of no service to\r\nlist all of the writings. The incident is thoroughly discussed in all\r\nhistories, whether British or American and in works devoted to\r\ninternational law. The contemporary American view is well stated, though\r\nfrom a strongly anti-British point of view, in Harris, T.L., _The Trent\r\nAffair_, but this monograph is lacking in exact reference for its many\r\ncitations and can not be accepted as authoritative. The latest review is\r\nthat of C.F. Adams in the _Proceedings_ of the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety for November, 1911, which called out a reply from R.H. Dana, and\r\na rejoinder by Mr. Adams in the _Proceedings_ for March, 1912.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: C.F. Adams, _The Trent Affair_. (_Proceedings_, Mass.\r\nHist.

No. 295. _Draft_.)\r\n\r\nThis résumé by Russell contained still other variations from the\r\noriginal reports of both Palmerston and Adams, but the latter did not\r\nthink it worth while to call attention to them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Walpole, _Russell_, II, p. 357, is evidently in error in\r\nstating that the law officers, while admitting the right of an American\r\nwar vessel to carry the British Packet into an American port for\r\nadjudication, added, \"she would have no right to remove Messrs. Mason\r\nand Slidell and carry them off as prisoners, leaving the ship to pursue\r\nher voyage.\" Certainly Palmerston did not so understand the\r\nadvice given.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: Lyons Papers. Hammond to Lyons. F. O., Private. Nov. 16,\r\n1861. This statement about explicit orders to Captain Marchand \"not to\r\nendeavour, etc.,\" is in line with Palmerston's understanding of the\r\nconversation with Adams. But that there was carelessness in reporting\r\nAdams is evident from Hammond's own language for \"no instructions to\r\nmeddle,\" which Adams did state, is not the same thing as \"instructions\r\nnot to meddle.\" Adams had no intent to deceive, but was misunderstood.\r\nHe was himself very anxious over the presence of the _James Adger_ at\r\nSouthampton, and hurried her Captain away. Adams informed Russell that\r\nPalmerston had not understood him correctly. He had told Palmerston, \"I\r\nhad seen the Captain's [Marchand's] instructions, which directed him to\r\nintercept the _Nashville_ if he could, and in case of inability to do\r\nso, to return at once to New York, keeping his eye on such British ships\r\nas might be going to the United States with contraband of war. Lord\r\nPalmerston's recollections and mine differed mainly in this last\r\nparticular. Lord Russell then remarked that this statement was exactly\r\nthat which he had recollected my making to him. Nothing had been said in\r\nthe instructions about other British ships.\" (State Dept., Eng., Vol.\r\n78. No. 80. Adams to Seward. Nov. 29. 1861.) Hammond's letter mentions\r\nalso the excitement of \"the Southerners\" in England and that they had\r\n\"sent out Pilot Boats to intercept and warn the Packet....\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: Lyons Papers.

This resulted,\r\nafter the _Trent_ affair had blown over, in a circumstance which\r\npermitted Seward, with keen delight, to extend a courtesy to Great\r\nBritain. Bancroft (II, 245) states that these troops \"finding the St.\r\nLawrence river full of ice, had entered Portland harbour. When\r\npermission was asked for them to cross Maine, Seward promptly ordered\r\nthat all facilities should be granted for 'landing and transporting to\r\nCanada or elsewhere troops, stores, and munitions of war of every kind\r\nwithout exception or reservation.'\" It is true that the American press\r\nmade much of this, and in tones of derision. The facts, as reported by\r\nLyons, were that the request was merely \"a superfluous application from\r\na private firm at Montreal for permission to land some Officers' Baggage\r\nat Portland.\" (Russell Papers, Lyons to Russell, Jan. 20, 1862.) Lyons\r\nwas much vexed with this \"trick\" of Seward's. He wrote to the\r\nGovernor-General of Canada and the Lieutenant-Governors of Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick, protesting against an acceptance of Seward's\r\npermission, and finally informed Russell that no English troops were\r\nmarched across the State of Maine.

(2) \"Unnecessary and dangerous Acts\r\nof violence\" were used. (3) The _Trent_, when stopped was not \"searched\"\r\nin the \"ordinary way,\" but \"certain Passengers\" were demanded and taken\r\nby force. (4) No charge was made that the _Trent_ was violating\r\nneutrality, and no authority for his act was offered by Captain Wilkes.\r\n(5) No force ought to be used against an \"_unresisting_ Neutral Ship\"\r\nexcept just so much as is necessary to bring her before a prize court.\r\n(6) In the present case the British vessel had done nothing, and\r\nintended nothing, warranting even an inquiry by a prize court. (7) \"It\r\nis essential for British Interests, that consistently with the\r\nobligations of neutrality, and of observing any _legal_ and _effective_\r\nblockade, there should be communication between the Dominions of Her\r\nMajesty and the Countries forming the Confederate States.\" These seven\r\npoints were for Lyons' eye alone. They certainly add no strength to the\r\nBritish position and reflect the uncertainty and confusion of the\r\nCabinet. The fifth and sixth points contain the essence of what, on more\r\nmature reflection, was to be the British argument. (F.O., Am., Vol. 758.\r\nNo. 447. Draft.

Rhodes, III, pp. 522-24, and\r\nBancroft, _Seward_, II, pp. 232-37, disprove this. Yet the general\r\ncontemporary suspicion of Seward's \"anti-British policy,\" even in\r\nWashington, is shown by a despatch sent by Schleiden to the Senate of\r\nBremen. On December 23 he wrote that letters from Cobden and Lyndhurst\r\nhad been seen by Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"Both letters have been submitted to the President. He returned them\r\nwith the remark that 'peace will not be broken if England is not bent on\r\nwar.'

No doubt Sumner was Schleiden's informant. At first\r\nglance Lincoln's reported language would seem to imply that he was\r\nputting pressure on Seward to release the prisoners and Schleiden\r\napparently so interpreted them. But the fact was that at the date when\r\nthis was written Lincoln had not yet committed himself to accepting\r\nSeward's view. He told Seward, \"You will go on, of course, preparing\r\nyour answer, which, as I understood it, will state the reasons why they\r\nought to be given up. Now, I have a mind to try my hand at stating the\r\nreasons why they ought _not_ to be given up.

This was the blockade of Southern\r\nports and coast line, which Lincoln had declared _in intention_ in his\r\nproclamation of April 19, 1861.\r\n\r\nAs early as December, 1860, Lyons had raised the question of the\r\nrelation of British ships and merchants to the secession port of\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, and had received from Judge Black an evasive\r\nreply[502]. In March, 1861, Russell had foreseen the possibility of a\r\nblockade, writing to Lyons that American precedent would at least\r\nrequire it to be an effective one, while Lyons made great efforts to\r\nconvince Seward that _any_ interference with British trade would be\r\ndisastrous to the Northern cause in England. He even went so far as to\r\nhint at British intervention to preserve trade[503]. But on April 15,\r\nLyons, while believing that no effective blockade was possible, thought\r\nthat the attempt to institute one was less objectionable than\r\nlegislation \"closing the Southern Ports as Ports of Entry,\" in reality a\r\nmere paper blockade and one which would \"justify Great Britain and\r\nFrance in recognizing the Southern Confederacy....\" Thus he began to\r\nweaken in opposition to _any_ interference[504]. His earlier expressions\r\nto Seward were but arguments, without committing his Government to a\r\nline of policy, and were intended to make Seward step cautiously.\r\n\r\nPossibly Lyons thought he could frighten the North out of a blockade\r\ncampaign. But when the Civil War actually began and Lincoln, on April\r\n19, declared he had \"deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade,\" and\r\nthat when a \"competent force\" had been posted \"so as to prevent entrance\r\nand exit of vessels,\" warning would be given to any vessel attempting to\r\nenter or to leave a blockaded port, with endorsement on her register of\r\nsuch warning, followed by seizure if she again attempted to pass the\r\nblockade, Lyons felt that: \"If it be carried on, with reasonable\r\nconsideration for Foreign Flags, and in strict conformity with the Law\r\nof Nations, I suppose it must be recognized[505].\" The Proclamation\r\nnamed the original seven seceding states, and on April 27 Virginia was\r\nadded. The blockade was actually begun at certain Virginia ports on\r\nApril 30, and by the end of May there were a few war-ships off all the\r\nmore important Southern harbours[506]. This method of putting a blockade\r\ninto effect by warning at the port rather than by a general notification\r\ncommunicated to European governments and setting a date, involved a\r\nhardship on British merchants since they were thereby made uncertain\r\nwhether goods started for a Southern port would be permitted to enter.\r\nIn practice vessels on their first departure from a blockaded harbour\r\nwere warned and permitted to go out, but those seeking to enter were\r\nwarned and turned back. In _effect_, while the blockade was being\r\nestablished, Lincoln's Proclamation had something of the nature for the\r\ntimid British merchant, though not for the bold one, of a paper\r\nblockade. This was not clearly understood by Lyons, who thought neutrals\r\nmust acquiesce, having \"exhausted every possible means of opposition,\"\r\nbut who consoled himself with the idea that \"for some time yet\" British\r\ntrade could be carried on[507].\r\n\r\nLyons was in fact sceptical, as he told Seward in a long conversation on\r\nApril 29 of the possibility of blockading a 3,000 mile coast line, but\r\nSeward assured him it would be done and effectively[508]. The British\r\npress was equally sceptical, and in any case believed that the war would\r\nbe of short duration, so that there need be no anxiety over next year's\r\nsupply of cotton[509]. In Parliament Russell took the stand that the\r\nblockade, if carried on in accordance with international law and made\r\neffective, required British recognition and respect. He also defended\r\nLincoln's \"notification at the port\" method, stating that it might seem\r\na hardship, but was perfectly legal[510]. Thus there was early and easy\r\nacquiescence in the American effort, but when, in June, there was\r\nrevived a Northern plan to close Southern ports by legislative action,\r\nBritain was stirred to quick and vigorous opposition. Lyons learned that\r\na Bill would be introduced in Congress giving the President authority,\r\namong other powers, to \"proclaim\" the ports closed, thus notifying\r\nforeign nations not to attempt to use them. He saw in it an unexpected\r\napplication of the Northern theory that the South was not a belligerent\r\nand had no rights as such, and he regarded it as in effect a paper\r\nblockade[511].\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the Bill as introduced in Congress did not direct\r\nthe President to issue a proclamation closing Southern ports--it merely\r\ngave him the power to do so. Almost from the first Lyons thought that\r\nLincoln and Seward were too wise to issue such a proclamation[512].\r\nNevertheless it was his duty to be on guard and to oppose the plan. For\r\nsix weeks there was much communication in regard to the \"Southern Ports\r\nBill,\" as all parties called it, from Russell to Lyons, and also with\r\nCowley in France. The British Foreign Office interest in the matter,\r\nalmost rising to excitement, is somewhat astonishing in view of the\r\nsmall importance evidently attached to the plan at Washington and the\r\nreluctance of France to be as vigorous as Great Britain in protest.\r\nVigorous Russell certainly was, using a \"high tone\" in official\r\nremonstrance to America not unlike that taken by Seward on British\r\nrecognition of Southern belligerency.\r\n\r\nImmediately on learning of the introduction of the Bill Russell\r\naddressed enquiries to Cowley asking what France intended and urged a\r\nstiff protest. Thouvenel had not heard of the Bill and was seemingly\r\nindifferent. At first he acquiesced in Russell's protest, then drew back\r\nand on three separate occasions promised support only to withdraw such\r\npromise. He was disinclined, said Cowley, to join in a \"friendly hint\"\r\nto America because of the touchy sensibilities lately shown by Seward,\r\nand feared a direct protest might result in an American declaration of\r\nwar. In any case why not wait until the President _did_ act, and even\r\nthen the proper method would be a protest rather than \"reprisals.\" \"I\r\nwish,\" wrote Cowley, on July 28, \"that the French were inclined to be\r\nmore _bumptious_, as they seemed to be at first. I would at all times\r\nrather have the task of calming them, than of urging them on[513]....\"\r\nNevertheless Russell on July 19 notified Lyons that England would not\r\nobserve a \"legislative closing\" of Southern ports[514]. On July 12 Lyons\r\ntelegraphed that the Bill had passed both Houses of Congress, and on the\r\nsixteenth he wrote privately to Russell that he was much disturbed over\r\nits possible consequences since \"even Sumner was for it[515],\" as this\r\nindicated a real intention to carry it into effect[516]. On August 8,\r\nRussell sent formal instructions of protest, a copy of which was to be\r\nhanded to Seward, but the next day authorized Lyons to exercise\r\ndiscretion as to communicating the despatch[517].\r\n\r\nThe original form of this instruction, dated in June and revised in\r\nJuly, concluded with language that might well draw out Thouvenel's\r\nobjection to a threat of \"reprisals.\" It read that \"H.M.G. ...\r\nreserve ... the right of acting in concert with other Nations in\r\nopposition to so violent an attack on the rights of Commercial Countries\r\nand so manifest a violation of International Law[518].\" This high tone\r\nhad been modified possibly by French opposition, possibly by Lyons'\r\nearly opinion that the Bill would not be made operative. Indeed on July\r\n24 Russell told Lyons that no final instruction of protest would be sent\r\nhim until the President actually issued a proclamation[519]. Yet in\r\nspite of being fairly well assured that there was no danger in the\r\n\"Southern Ports Bill,\" Russell did send the instruction of August 8,\r\nstill distinctly \"vigorous\" in tone, though with no threat of\r\n\"reprisals.\" His reason for doing so is difficult to understand.\r\nCertainly he was hardly serious in arguing to Thouvenel that a stiff\r\ninstruction would strengthen the hands of the \"moderate section\" of the\r\nAmerican Cabinet[520], or else he strangely misjudged American\r\ntemperament. Probably a greater reason was his wish to be able to print\r\na Parliamentary Paper indicating the watchful care he was exercising in\r\nguarding British interests.\r\n\r\nBefore Russell's instruction could reach America Seward had voluntarily\r\nreassured Lyons as to American intentions. Lyons reported this,\r\nprivately, on July 20[521], but on the same day also reported,\r\nofficially, that two days earlier, that is on the eighteenth, he and\r\nMercier had discussed the \"Southern Ports\" Bill and that as a result\r\nMercier had then gone, that same day, to Seward to state that France\r\nmust regard such a measure as merely a paper blockade[522]. \"We were not\r\nvery sanguine of success,\" wrote Lyons, but Seward \"had listened to him\r\n[Mercier] with calmness,\" and personally seemed disinclined to issue the\r\nrequired Proclamation. This despatch, making it appear that England and\r\nFrance were in close harmony and that Lyons and Mercier were having a\r\ndifficult time at Washington was printed, later, in the Parliamentary\r\nPapers. It was received by Russell on August 5, and in spite of the\r\nreassurances of Lyons' private letter (naturally not for printing)\r\npresumably received in the same mail with the official despatch, it\r\nfurnished the basis of his \"strong\" instruction of August 8.\r\n\r\nAt Washington also there were indications of an effort to prepare a good\r\ncase for the British public and Parliament. July 23, so Lyons wrote\r\nprivately, Seward had prevented the issue of the \"Southern Ports\"\r\nProclamation[523], and on the next day he was shown by Seward,\r\nconfidentially, an instruction to Adams and other Ministers abroad in\r\nwhich was maintained the right to close the ports by proclamation, but\r\nstating the Government's decision not to exercise the right. Lyons\r\nbelieved this was the end of the matter[524]. Yet on August 12, he\r\npresented himself formally at the Department of State and stated that he\r\nhad instructions to declare that \"Her Majesty's Government would\r\nconsider a decree closing the ports of the South actually in possession\r\nof the insurgent or Confederate States as null and void, and that they\r\nwould not submit to measures taken on the high seas in pursuance of such\r\ndecree.\"... \"Mr. Seward thanked me for the consideration I had shown;\r\nand begged me to confine myself for the present to the verbal\r\nannouncement I had just made. He said it would be difficult for me to\r\ndraw up a written communication which would not have the air of a\r\nthreat.\" To this Lyons agreed[525].\r\n\r\nThis permitted a warmth-creating impression to Englishmen of the\r\n\"forthright yet friendly\" tone of British diplomats when dealing with\r\nSeward. So also did Russell's instruction of August 8, not yet received\r\nby Lyons when he took the stage at Washington. Yet there is a\r\npossibility that Lyons was in fact merely playing his part as Seward had\r\nasked him to play it. On the next day, August 13, he acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of Russell's communication of July 24, in which it was stated\r\nthat while Great Britain could not acquiesce in the \"Southern Ports\"\r\nBill _no final instructions_ would be sent until Lincoln issued a\r\nProclamation. Lyons now explained, \"As Mr. Seward is undoubtedly at this\r\nmoment opposed to closing the Ports, I have thought it wiser to be\r\nguided by him for the present as to the mode of communicating your\r\ndecision about the matter[526].\" Is it possible that Seward really\r\nwished to have a \"strong,\" yet not \"too strong\" statement from Lyons in\r\norder to combat the advocates of the \"Ports\" Bill? There are many\r\nramifications of diplomatic policy--especially in a popular government.\r\nAt any rate on August 16 Lyons could assure Russell that there \"was no\r\nquestion now of issuing the Proclamation[527].\" And on the nineteenth\r\ncould write officially that a Proclamation based on the Bill had indeed\r\nbeen issued, but without the objectionable fourth section[528].\r\n\r\nThe whole affair of the \"Southern Ports\" Bill occupies more space in the\r\nBritish Parliamentary Papers, and excited more attention from the\r\nBritish Government than it would seem to have merited from the\r\nWashington attitude toward it. The Bill had been drawn by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and its other sections related to methods of meeting a\r\nsituation where former customs houses and places for the collection of\r\nimport duties were now in the hands of the Confederacy. The fourth\r\nsection alone implied a purpose to declare a paper blockade. The idea\r\nof proclaiming closed the Southern ports may have at first received the\r\nsanction of Seward as consistent with his denial of the existence of a\r\nwar; or it may have been a part of his \"high tone\" foreign policy[529],\r\nbut the more reasonable supposition is that the Bill was merely one of\r\nmany ill-considered measures put forth in the first months of the war by\r\nthe North in its spasm of energy seeking to use every and any public\r\nmeans to attack the South. But the interest attached to the measure in\r\nthis work is the British attitude. There can be no doubt that Russell,\r\nin presenting papers to Parliament was desirous of making clear two\r\npoints: first, the close harmony with France--which in fact was not so\r\nclose as was made to appear; second, the care and vigour of the Foreign\r\nSecretary in guarding British interests. Now in fact British trade was\r\ndestined to be badly hurt by the blockade, but as yet had not been\r\ngreatly hampered. Nor did Russell yet think an effective blockade\r\nfeasible. Writing to Lyons a week after his official protest on the\r\n\"Southern Ports\" Bill, he expressed the opinion that a \"_regular_\r\nblockade\" could not possibly prevent trade with the South:\r\n\r\n     \"If our ships can go in ballast for cotton to the Southern\r\n     Ports it will be well, but if this cannot be done by\r\n     agreement there will be surely, in the extent of 3,000 miles,\r\n     creeks and bays out of which small vessels may come, and run\r\n     for Jamaica or the Bahamas where the cargoes might be\r\n     transhipped. But it is not for Downing Street to suggest such\r\n     plans to Cheapside and Tooley Street[530].\"\r\n\r\nA better knowledge of American geography would have made clear to\r\nRussell that if but seven Southern ports were effectively blockaded the\r\nremaining 2,550 miles of coast line would be useless for the export of\r\ncotton in any considerable amount. His bays and creeks did indeed long\r\nprovide access to small vessels, but these were not adequate for the\r\ntransport of a bulky export like cotton[531]. To Russell, however, the\r\nblockade appearing negligible in probable effect and also not open to\r\nobjection by neutrals if regularly established, it seemed that any\r\nimmediate danger to British trade was averted by the final American\r\naction on the \"Southern Ports\" Bill. It was not until the blockade did\r\nbegin to be thoroughly effective that either the British public or\r\nGovernment gave it serious consideration.\r\n\r\nNot again until late November did Russell return with any interest to\r\nthe subject of the blockade and then it was again on an American effort\r\nwhich seemed to indicate the ineffectiveness of blockading squadrons and\r\na plan to remedy this by unusual, even \"uncivilized,\" if not illegal,\r\nmethods. This was the \"Stone Boat Fleet\" plan of blocking Charleston\r\nharbour by sinking vessels across the entrance bar[532]. The plan was\r\nreported by Lyons and the news received in England at the most uncertain\r\nmoment as to the outcome of the _Trent_ controversy[533]. British press\r\nand Government at first placed no stress on it, presumably because of\r\nthe feeling that in view of the existing crisis it was a minor matter.\r\nIn the same week Lyons, having been asked by Russell for an opinion on\r\nthe blockade, answered:\r\n\r\n     \"I am a good deal puzzled as to how I ought to answer your\r\n     question whether I consider the Blockade effective. It is\r\n     certainly by no means strict or vigorous along the immense\r\n     extent of coast to which it is supposed to apply. I suppose\r\n     the ships which run it successfully both in and out are more\r\n     numerous than those which are intercepted. On the other hand\r\n     it is very far from being a mere Paper Blockade. A great many\r\n     vessels are captured; it is a most serious interruption to\r\n     Trade; and if it were as ineffective as Mr. Jefferson Davis\r\n     says in his Message, he would not be so very anxious to get\r\n     rid of it[534].\"\r\n\r\nThis was a very fair description of the blockade situation. Lyons,\r\nunaffected by irritations resulting from the _Trent_, showed the frame\r\nof mind of a \"determined neutral,\" as he was fond of describing himself.\r\nHis answer was the first given to Russell indicating a possibility that\r\nthe blockade might, after all, become strictly effective and thus\r\nexceedingly harmful to British trade. There is no direct _proof_ that\r\nthis influenced Russell to denounce the plan of blocking Southern\r\nharbours with stone-laden boats sunk in the channel, but the existence\r\nof such a motive seems probable. Moreover his protest was not made until\r\nDecember 20, the _day after_ he had learned officially from Adams that\r\nWilkes was unauthorized in searching the _Trent_--a day on which strain\r\nand uncertainty regarding American intentions were greatly lessened.\r\nRussell then wrote to Lyons that he observed it to be stated,\r\n\"apparently on good authority,\" that the declared purpose of the stone\r\nboat fleet was \"of destroying these harbours for ever.\" He\r\ncharacterized this as implying \"utter despair of the restoration of the\r\nUnion,\" and as being only \"a measure of revenge and irremediable injury\r\nagainst an enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even in this view, as a scheme of embittered and sanguinary war,\r\nsuch a measure is not justifiable. It is a plot against the commerce of\r\nnations and the free intercourse of the Southern States of America with\r\nthe civilized world. It is a project worthy only of times of barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nLyons was instructed to speak in this sense to Seward, who, it was\r\nhoped, would disavow the project[535].\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in Lyons' despatches, nor in the American newspaper\r\nextracts accompanying them, to warrant such accusation and\r\nexpostulation. Lyons had merely commented that by some in America the\r\nproject had been characterized as \"odious and barbarous,\" adding, \"The\r\nquestion seems to depend on the extent to which the harbours will be\r\npermanently injured[536].\" It will be noted that Russell did not refer\r\nto information received from Lyons (though it was already in hand), but\r\nto \"apparently good authority\" in justification of his vigorous\r\ndenunciation. But like vigour, and like characterization of American\r\n\"barbarism\" did not appear in the British press until after the news\r\narrived of the release of Mason and Slidell. Then the storm broke, well\r\nsummed up in the Punch cartoon entitled \"Retrogression. (A Very Sad\r\nPicture.) War Dance of the I.O.U. Indian,\" and showing Uncle Sam in\r\nwar-feathers and with war-club, in his hand a flag made of the _New York\r\nHerald_, dancing in glee on the shores of a deserted harbour across\r\nwhich stretched a row of sunken ships[537].\r\n\r\nOn January 13 the Liverpool Shipowners' Association called the attention\r\nof the Foreign Office to the news that Charleston harbour had been\r\nclosed by stone boats and urged governmental remonstrance[538]. Hammond\r\nat once replied quoting the language of Russell's letter of December 20\r\nand stating that further representations would be made[539]. On the\r\nsixteenth Russell again instructed Lyons to speak to Seward, but now was\r\nmuch less rasping in language, arguing, rather, the injury in the future\r\nto the United States itself in case the harbours were permanently\r\ndestroyed since \"... the object of war is peace, and the purposes of\r\npeace are mutual goodwill and advantageous commercial intercourse[540].\"\r\nTo-day it seems absurd that any save the most ignorant observer should\r\nhave thought the North contemplated a permanent and revengeful\r\ndestruction of Southern port facilities. Nor was there any just ground\r\nfor such an extreme British view of the Northern plan. Yet even Robert\r\nBrowning was affected by the popular outcry. \"For what will you do,\" he\r\nwrote Story, \"if Charleston becomes loyal again[541]?\" a query\r\nexpressive of the increasing English concern, even alarm, at the intense\r\nbitterness, indicating a long war, of the American belligerents. How\r\nabsurd, not to say ridiculous, was this British concern at an American\r\n\"lapse toward barbarism\" was soon made evident. On January II Lyons,\r\nacting on the instructions of December 20, brought up the matter with\r\nSeward and was promptly assured that there was no plan whatever \"to\r\ninjure the harbours permanently.\" Seward stated that there had never\r\nbeen any plan, even, to sink boats in the main entrance channels, but\r\nmerely the lesser channels, because the Secretary of the Navy had\r\nreported that with the blockading fleet he could \"stop up the 'large\r\nholes,'\" but \"could not stop up the 'small ones.'\" Seward assured Lyons\r\nthat just as soon as the Union was restored all obstructions would be\r\nremoved, and he added that the best proof that the entrance to\r\nCharleston harbour had not been destroyed was the fact that in spite of\r\nblockading vessels and stone boats \"a British steamer laden with\r\ncontraband of war had just succeeded in getting in[542].\" Again, on\r\nFebruary 10, this time following Russell's instruction of January 16,\r\nLyons approached Seward and was told that he might inform Russell that\r\n\"all the vessels laden with stone, which had been prepared for\r\nobstructing the harbours, had been already sunk, and that it is not\r\nlikely that any others will be used for that purpose[543].\" This was no\r\nyielding to Great Britain, nor even an answer to Russell's accusation of\r\nbarbarity. The fact was that the plan of obstruction of harbours,\r\nextending even to placing a complete barrier, had been undertaken by the\r\nNavy with little expectation of success, and, on the first appearance of\r\nnew channels made by the wash of waters, was soon abandoned[544].\r\n\r\nThe British outcry, Russell's assumption in protest that America was\r\nconducting war with barbarity, and the protest itself, may seem at first\r\nglance to have been merely manifestations of a British tendency to\r\nmeddle, as a \"superior nation\" in the affairs of other states and to\r\ngive unasked-for advice. A hectoring of peoples whose civilization was\r\npresumably less advanced than that which stamped the Englishman was,\r\naccording to Matthew Arnold, traditional--was a characteristic of\r\nBritish public and Government alike[545]. But this is scarcely a\r\nsatisfactory explanation in the present case. For in the first place it\r\nis to be remarked that the sinking of obstructions in an enemy's\r\nharbours in order to render more effective a blockade was no novelty in\r\nmaritime warfare, as Russell must have well known, and that there was no\r\nmodern record of such obstructions having permanently destroyed a\r\nharbour. A far more reasonable explanation is that which connects the\r\nenergy of the British Government in opposing a proposed American closing\r\nof Southern harbours by Presidential proclamation, with a like energy\r\nagainst the stone boat project. The first method was indeed rightly\r\nregarded as a violation of accustomed maritime belligerency, but both\r\nmethods were primarily objectionable in British eyes because they were\r\nvery evidently the result of efforts to find a way in which an as yet\r\nineffective blockade could be made more rigorous. On the impossibility\r\nof an effective blockade, if conducted on customary lines, the British\r\npeople and Foreign Secretary had pinned their faith that there would be\r\nno serious interruption of trade. This was still the view in January,\r\n1862, though doubts were arising, and the \"stone boat\" protest must be\r\nregarded as another evidence of watchful guardianship of commerce with\r\nthe South. The very thought that the blockade might become effective, in\r\nwhich case all precedent would demand respect for it, possibly caused\r\nRussell to use a tone not customary with him in upbraiding the North for\r\na planned \"barbarity.\"\r\n\r\nWithin three months the blockade and its effectiveness was to be made\r\nthe subject of the first serious parliamentary discussion on the Civil\r\nWar in America. In another three months the Government began to feel a\r\npressure from its associate in \"joint attitude,\" France, to examine\r\nagain with much care its asserted policy of strict neutrality, and this\r\nbecause of the increased effectiveness of the blockade. Meanwhile\r\nanother \"American question\" was serving to cool somewhat British\r\neagerness to go hand in hand with France. For nearly forty years since\r\nindependence from Spain the Mexican Republic had offered a thorny\r\nproblem to European nations since it was difficult, in the face of the\r\nAmerican Monroe Doctrine, to put sufficient pressure upon her for the\r\nsatisfaction of the just claims of foreign creditors. In 1860 measures\r\nwere being prepared by France, Great Britain and Spain to act jointly in\r\nthe matter of Mexican debts. Commenting on these measures, President\r\nBuchanan in his annual message to Congress of December 3, 1860, had\r\nsounded a note of warning to Europe indicating that American principles\r\nwould compel the use of force in aid of Mexico if debt-collecting\r\nefforts were made the excuse for a plan \"to deprive our neighbouring\r\nRepublic of portions of her territory.\" But this was at the moment of\r\nthe break-up of the Union and attracted little attention in the United\r\nStates. For the same reason, no longer fearing an American block to\r\nthese plans, the three European Governments, after their invitation to\r\nthe United States to join them had been refused, signed a convention,\r\nOctober 31, 1861, to force a payment of debts by Mexico. They pledged\r\nthemselves, however, to seek no accession of territory and not to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn this pledge Great Britain and Spain were sincere. Napoleon III was\r\nnot--was indeed pursuing a policy not at first understood even by his\r\nMinisters[546]. A joint expedition under the leadership of the Spanish\r\nGeneral Prim was despatched, and once in Mexico took possession of\r\ncustoms houses and began to collect duties. It soon became evident to\r\nthe British and Spanish agents on the spot that France had far other\r\nobjects than the mere satisfaction of debts. The result was a clash of\r\ninterests, followed by separate agreements with Mexico and the\r\nwithdrawal of forces by Great Britain and Spain. This difference of view\r\non Mexican policy had become clear to Cowley, British Ambassador at\r\nParis, by January, 1862, and from that month until the end of March his\r\nprivate letters to Russell referring to American affairs in general are\r\nalmost wholly concerned with French designs on Mexico. Cowley learned\r\nthat earlier rumours of Napoleon's purpose to place the Archduke\r\nMaximilian of Austria upon the _Throne_ of Mexico, far from being\r\nunfounded, were but faint indications of a great French \"colonial\r\nEmpire\" scheme, and he thought that there was \"some ill-will to the\r\nUnited States at the bottom of all this[547]....\" He feared that the\r\nMexican question would \"give us a deal of trouble yet[548],\" and by\r\nMarch was writing of the \"monstrous claims on the Mexican Govt.\" made by\r\nFrance[549].\r\n\r\nThese reactions of Cowley were fully shared by Russell, and he hastened,\r\nin March, to withdraw British forces in Mexico, as also did Spain. Great\r\nBritain believed that she had been tricked into a false position in\r\nMexico, hastened to escape from it, but in view of the close relation of\r\njoint policy with France toward the Civil War in America, undertook no\r\ndirect opposition though prophesying an evil result. This situation\r\nrequired France to refrain, for a time, from criticism of British policy\r\nand action toward the North--to pursue, in brief, a \"follow on\" policy,\r\nrather than one based on its own initiative. On the British side the\r\nFrench Mexican policy created a suspicion of Napoleon's hidden purposes\r\nand objects in the Civil War and made the British Government slow to\r\naccept French suggestions. The result was that in relation to that war\r\nGreat Britain set the pace and France had to keep step--a very\r\nadvantageous situation for the North, as the event was to prove. On the\r\npurely Mexican question Lyons early took opportunity to assure Seward\r\nthat Great Britain was \"entirely averse to any interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of Mexico, and that nothing could be further from their\r\nwishes than to impose upon the Mexican Nation any Government not of its\r\nown choice[550].\"\r\n\r\nBritish dislike of France's Mexican venture served to swell the breeze\r\nof amity toward America that had sprung up once the _Trent_ was beyond\r\nthe horizon, and made, temporarily, for smooth sailing in the relations\r\nof Great Britain and the North. Lyons wrote on February 7 that the\r\n\"present notion appears to be to overwhelm us with demonstrations of\r\nfriendship and confidence[551].\" Adams' son in London thought \"our work\r\nhere is past its crisis,\" and that, \"Our victory is won on this side the\r\nwater[552],\" while the American Minister himself believed that \"the\r\nprospect of interference with us is growing more and more remote[553].\"\r\nRussell also was optimistic, writing to Lyons, \"Our relations have now\r\ngot into a very smooth groove.... There is no longer any excitement here\r\nupon the question of America. I fear Europe is going to supplant the\r\naffairs of America as an exciting topic[554],\" meaning, presumably,\r\ndisturbances arising in Italy. On April 4 Adams described his diplomatic\r\nduties as \"almost in a state of profound calm[555].\"\r\n\r\nThis quiet in relation to America is evidence that no matter what\r\nanxiety was felt by British statesmen over the effects of the blockade\r\nthere was as yet no inclination seriously to question its legality. That\r\nthere was, nevertheless, real anxiety is shown by an urgent letter from\r\nWestbury to Palmerston upon the blockade, asserting that if cotton\r\nbrought but four pence at Charleston and thirteen pence at Liverpool\r\nthere must be some truth in its alleged effectiveness:\r\n\r\n     \"I am greatly opposed to any violent interference. Do not let\r\n     us give the Federal States any pretence for saying that they\r\n     failed thro' our interference.... Patience for a few more\r\n     weeks is I am satisfied the wiser and the more expedient\r\n     policy[556].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING COTTON BOUND: Or, The Modern Prometheus. _Reproduced\r\nby permission of the Proprietors of \"Punch\"_]\r\n\r\nThis would indicate some Cabinet discussion, at least, on the blockade\r\nand on British trade interests. But Westbury's \"few more weeks\" had no\r\nplace in Russell's thought, for on February 15 he wrote to Lyons in\r\nregard to assertions being made that the blockade was ineffective\r\nbecause certain vessels had eluded it:\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty's Government, however, are of opinion that,\r\n     assuming that the blockade is duly notified, and also that a\r\n     number of ships is stationed and remains at the entrance of a\r\n     port, sufficient really to prevent access to it or to create\r\n     an evident danger of entering or leaving it, and that these\r\n     ships do not voluntarily permit ingress or egress, the fact\r\n     that various ships may have successfully escaped through it\r\n     (as in the particular instances here referred to) will not of\r\n     itself prevent the blockade from being an effective one by\r\n     international law[557].\"\r\n\r\nFrom this view Russell never departed in official instructions[558].\r\nEngland's position as the leading maritime Power made it inevitable that\r\nshe should promptly approve the Northern blockade effort and be cautious\r\nin criticizing its legitimate operation. Both her own history and\r\nprobable future interests when a belligerent, required such a policy far\r\nmore important in the eyes of statesmen than any temporary injury to\r\nBritish commerce. English merchants, if determined to trade with the\r\nSouth, must take their own risks, and that Russell believed they would\r\ndo so is evidenced by his comment to Adams that it was a tradition of\r\nthe sea that Englishmen \"would, if money were to be made by it, send\r\nsupplies even to hell at the risk of burning their sails.\"\r\n\r\nBut trade problems with the South soon brought real pressure on the\r\nGovernment. In January, while marking time until Mason should arrive at\r\nhis post, the Confederate commissioners already in London very nearly\r\ntook a step that might have prejudiced the new envoy's position. They\r\nhad now learned through public documents that Russell had informed Adams\r\nhe \"had no intention of seeing them again.\" Very angry they planned a\r\nformal protest to the British Government, but in the end Mann and Rost\r\ncounselled silence, outvoting Yancey[559]. On his arrival Mason ignored\r\nthis situation and with cause for, warmly received socially in\r\npro-Southern circles, he felt confident that at least a private\r\nreception would soon be given him by Russell. He became, indeed,\r\nsomewhat of a social lion, and mistaking this personal popularity for\r\nevidence of parliamentary, if not governmental, attitude, was confident\r\nof quick advantages for the South. On the day after his arrival he wrote\r\nunofficially to Hunter, Confederate Secretary of State \"... although the\r\nMinistry may hang back in regard to the blockade and recognition through\r\nthe Queen's speech, at the opening of Parliament next week the popular\r\nvoice through the House of Commons will demand both.\"... \"I shall be\r\ndisappointed if the Parliament does not insist on definite action by the\r\nMinistry[560]....\"\r\n\r\nCarefully considering the situation and taking the advice of many\r\nEnglish friends, Mason and Slidell agreed that the best line to take was\r\nto lay aside for the moment the claim to recognition and to urge\r\nEuropean repudiation of the blockade. Slidell, arrived in Paris, wrote\r\nMason that in his coming interview with Thouvenel he should \"make only a\r\npassing allusion to the question of recognition, intimating that on that\r\npoint I am not disposed at present to press consideration. But I shall\r\ninsist upon the inefficiency of the blockade, the 'vandalism of the\r\nstone fleet,' etc[561].\" Mason was urged to take a like course with\r\nRussell. Both men were much excited by a document a copy of which had\r\nbeen secured by Mann purporting to be a \"confidential memorandum\"\r\naddressed by England to the Continental Powers, asking whether the time\r\nhad not come to raise the blockade. No such memorandum existed, but\r\nSlidell and Mason believed it genuine[562]. They had great hopes of the\r\nopening of Parliament, but when that event took place, February 6, and\r\nthe only references in debate were to the _Trent_ and its fortunate\r\noutcome, Mason was puzzled and chagrined. He wrote: \"It is thought that\r\nsilence as to the blockade was intended to leave that question\r\nopen[563].\" This, no doubt, was the consolatory explanation of his\r\nfriends, but the unofficial interview with Russell, at his home, on\r\nFebruary 10, chilled Mason's hopes.\r\n\r\nAs agreed with Slidell, emphasis in this interview was laid by Mason on\r\nthe blockade, though recognition was asked. His report to Richmond shows\r\nthat he proceeded with great caution, omitting portions of his\r\ninstructions on cotton for fear of arousing antagonism, and venturing\r\nonly a slight departure by expressing the hope that if Great Britain\r\nwished to renew communication with the Confederacy it might be made\r\nthrough him, rather than through the British consuls at the South.\r\nRussell's \"only reply was, he hoped I might find my residence in London\r\nagreeable.\" He refused to see Mason's credentials, stating this to be\r\n\"unnecessary, our relations being unofficial.\" He listened with\r\ncourtesy, asked a few questions, but \"seemed utterly disinclined to\r\nenter into conversation at all as to the policy of his Government, and\r\nonly said, in substance, they must await events.\" Certainly it was a\r\ncool reception, and Mason departed with the conviction that Russell's\r\n\"personal sympathies were not with us, and his policy inaction[564].\"\r\nBut Mason still counted on parliamentary pressure on the Government, and\r\nhe was further encouraged in this view by a letter from Spence, at\r\nLiverpool, stating that he had just received a request to come to London\r\n\"from a government quarter, of all the _most important_[565].\"\r\n\r\nThe summons of Spence to London shows that the Government itself feared\r\nsomewhat a pro-Southern move in Parliament. He reported to Mason that\r\ninterviews had taken place with Palmerston and with Russell, that he had\r\nunfortunately missed one with Gladstone, and, while not citing these men\r\ndirectly, declared the general \"London idea\" to be that of\r\n\"postponement\"; since it was inevitable that \"the North will break down\r\nin a few months on the score of money,\" and that \"We have only to wait\r\nthree months.\" Evidently Spence believed he was being used as an\r\nintermediary and influential adviser in pro-Southern circles to persuade\r\nthem to a period of quiet. This, he thought, was unwise since delay\r\nwould be injurious[566]. Of like opinion were the two Members of\r\nParliament who were, throughout Mason's career in England, to be his\r\nclosest advisers. These were Gregory and Lindsay, the former possessing\r\nsomewhat of a following in the \"gentleman-ruler\" class, the latter the\r\nlargest shipowner in Great Britain. Their advice also was to press on\r\nthe blockade question[567], as a matter of primary British commercial\r\ninterest, and they believed that France was eager to follow a British\r\nlead. This was contrary to Slidell's notion at the moment, but of this\r\nMason was unaware[568].\r\n\r\nThe Government did indeed feel compelled to lay before Parliament the\r\npapers on the blockade. This was a bulky document of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six pages and covered the period from May 3, 1861, to February\r\n17, 1862. In it were the details of the institution of the blockade,\r\nreports from British consuls on its effectiveness, lists of vessels\r\ncaptured and of vessels evading it, all together furnishing a very\r\ncomplete view of this, the principal maritime belligerent effort of the\r\nNorth[569]. The Blockade Papers gave opportunity for debate, if desired,\r\nand especially so as almost at the end of this document appeared that\r\ninstruction of February 15 by Russell to Lyons, which clearly stated\r\nBritish acceptance of the blockade as effective. Mason's interview with\r\nRussell occurred on the tenth. Five days later, after Spence had been\r\nurged vainly to use his influence for \"postponement,\" Russell, so it\r\nmust appear, gave challenge to pro-Southern sentiment by asserting the\r\neffectiveness of the blockade, a challenge almost immediately made known\r\nto Parliament by the presentation of papers.\r\n\r\nUnless Southern sympathizers were meekly to acquiesce, without further\r\nprotest, in governmental policy they must now make some decided effort.\r\nThis came in the shape of a debate in the Commons, on March 7, of a\r\nmotion by Gregory urging the Government to declare the blockade\r\nineffective[570], and of a similar debate on March 10 in the Lords. As\r\nis inevitable where many speakers participate in a debate the arguments\r\nadvanced were repeated and reiterated. In the Commons important speeches\r\nfor the motion were made by Gregory, Bentinck, Sir James Ferguson, Lord\r\nRobert Cecil and Lindsay, while against it appeared Forster and Monckton\r\nMilnes. The Solicitor-General, Roundell Palmer, presented the Government\r\nview. Gregory opened the debate by seeking to make clear that while\r\nhimself favourable to recognition of the South the present motion had no\r\nessential bearing on that question and was directed wholly to a\r\n_fact_--that the blockade was not in reality effective and should not be\r\nrecognized as such. He presented and analysed statistics to prove the\r\nfrequency with which vessels passed through the blockade, using the\r\nsummaries given by Mason to Russell in their interview of February 10,\r\nwhich were now before Parliament in the document on the blockade just\r\npresented, and he cited the reports of Bunch at Charleston as further\r\nevidence. This was the burden of Gregory's argument[571], but he glanced\r\nin passing at many other points favourable to the South, commenting on\r\nits free trade principles, depicting the \"Stone Fleet\" as a barbarity,\r\nasserting the right of the South to secede, declaring that France\r\nregarded British attitude as determined by a selfish policy looking to\r\nfuture wars, and attacking Seward on the ground of American\r\ninconsistency, falsely paraphrasing him as stating that \"as for all\r\nthose principles of international law, which we have ever upheld, they\r\nare as but dust in the balance compared with the exigencies of the\r\nmoment[572].\" Gregory concluded with the statement that the United\r\nStates should be treated \"with justice and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nWhen presenting a cause in Parliament its advocates should agree on a\r\nline of argument. The whole theory of this movement on the blockade was\r\nthat it was wise to minimize the question of recognition, and Gregory\r\nhad laboured to prove that this was not related to a refusal longer to\r\nrecognize the blockade. But Bentinck, the second speaker for the motion,\r\npromptly undid him for he unhappily admitted that recognition and\r\nblockade questions were so closely interwoven that they could not be\r\nconsidered separately. This was promptly seized upon by Forster, who led\r\nin opposition. Forster's main argument, however, was a very able tearing\r\nto pieces of Gregory's figures, showing that nearly all the alleged\r\nblockade runners were in reality merely small coasting steamers, which,\r\nby use of shallow inner channels, could creep along the shore and then\r\nmake a dash for the West Indies. The effectiveness of the blockade of\r\nmain ports for ocean-going vessels carrying bulky cargoes was proved, he\r\ndeclared, by the price of raw cotton in England, where it was 100 per\r\ncent. greater than in the South, and of salt in Charleston, where the\r\nimporter could make a profit of 1,000 per cent. To raise the blockade,\r\nhe argued, would be a direct violation by Britain of her neutrality. The\r\nreal reason for this motion was not the _ineffectiveness_ of the\r\nblockade, but the effectiveness, and the real object an English object,\r\nnot a Southern one. Gregory was taunted for changing a motion to\r\nrecognize the Confederacy into the present one because he knew the\r\nformer would fail while the present motion was deceitfully intended to\r\nsecure the same end. Forster strongly approved the conduct of the\r\nGovernment in preserving strict neutrality, alleging that any other\r\nconduct would have meant \"a war in which she [England] would have had to\r\nfight for slavery against her kinsmen.\"\r\n\r\nGregory's speech was cautious and attempted to preserve a judicial tone\r\nof argument on fact. Forster's reads like that of one who knows his\r\ncause already won. Gregory's had no fire in it and was characterized by\r\nHenry Adams, an interested auditor, as \"listened to as you would listen\r\nto a funeral eulogy.\"... \"The blockade is now universally acknowledged\r\nto be unobjectionable[573].\" This estimate is borne out by the speech\r\nfor the Government by the Solicitor-General, who maintained the\r\neffectiveness of the blockade and who answered Gregory's argument that\r\nrecognition was not in question by stating that to refuse longer to\r\nrecognize the blockade would result in a situation of \"armed\r\nneutrality\"--that is of \"unproclaimed war.\" He pictured the disgust of\r\nEurope if England should enter upon such a war in alliance \"with a\r\ncountry ... which is still one of the last strongholds of slavery\"--an\r\nadmission made in the fervour of debate that was dangerous as tending to\r\ntie the Government's hands in the future, but which was, no doubt,\r\nmerely a personal and carelessly ventured view, not a governmentally\r\nauthorized one. In general the most interesting feature of this debate\r\nis the hearty approval given by friends of the North to the Government's\r\nentire line of policy and conduct in relation to America. Their play at\r\nthe moment, feeling insecure as to the fixity of governmental policy,\r\nwas to approve heartily the neutrality now existing, and to make no\r\ncriticisms. Later, when more confident of the permanency of British\r\nneutrality, they in turn became critics on the score of failure, in\r\nspecific cases, in neutral duty.\r\n\r\nThe Solicitor-General's speech showed that there was no hope for the\r\nmotion unless it could be made a party question. Of that there was no\r\nindication, and the motion was withdrawn. Three days later a similar\r\ndebate in the Lords was of importance only as offering Russell, since he\r\nwas now a member of the upper chamber, an opportunity to speak for\r\nhimself. Lord Campbell had disavowed any intention to attack the\r\nblockade since Russell, on February 15, had officially approved it, but\r\ncriticized the sending to Lyons of the despatch itself. Russell upheld\r\nthe strict legality and effectiveness of the blockade, stated that if\r\nEngland sided with the South in any way the North would appeal to a\r\nslave insurrection--the first reference to an idea which was to play a\r\nvery important rôle with Russell and others later--and concluded by\r\nexpressing the opinion that three months would see the end of the\r\nstruggle on lines of separation, but with some form of union between the\r\ntwo sovereignties[574]. Russell's speech was an unneeded but emphatic\r\nnegative of the pro-Southern effort.\r\n\r\nClearly Southern sympathizers had committed an error in tactics by\r\npressing for a change of British policy. The rosy hopes of Mason were\r\ndashed and the effect of the efforts of his friends was to force the\r\nGovernment to a decided stand when they preferred, as the summons of\r\nSpence to conference makes evident, to leave in abeyance for a time any\r\nfurther declaration on the blockade. The refusal of Mason and his\r\nSouthern friends to wait compelled a governmental decision and the\r\nresult was Russell's instruction to Lyons of February 15. The effect of\r\nthe debate on Mason was not to cause distrust of his English advisers,\r\nbut to convince him that the existing Government was more determined in\r\nunfriendliness than he had supposed. Of the blockade he wrote: \"... no\r\nstep will be taken by this Government to interfere with it[575].\" He\r\nthought the military news from America in part responsible as: \"The late\r\nreverses at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson have had an unfortunate effect\r\nupon the minds of our friends here[576]....\" Spence was opposed to any\r\nfurther move in Parliament until some more definite push on the\r\nGovernment from France should occur[577]. Slidell, anxiously watching\r\nfrom Paris the effort in England, had now altered his view of policy and\r\nwas convinced there was no hope in France until England gave the signal.\r\nReferring to his previous idea that the Continent could be put in\r\nopposition to Great Britain on the blockade he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"I then supposed that the influence of the Emperor was such\r\n     that any view of the question which he might urge on the\r\n     British Cabinet would be adopted. I have since had reason to\r\n     change entirely this opinion. I am now satisfied that in all\r\n     that concerns us the initiative must be taken by England;\r\n     that the Emperor sets such value on her good will that he\r\n     will make any sacrifice of his own opinions and policy to\r\n     retain it[578].\"\r\n\r\nOn March 28 he repeated this conviction to Mason[579]. It was a correct\r\njudgment. Mason was thereby exalted with the knowledge that his was to\r\nbe the first place in importance in any and all operations intended to\r\nsecure European support for the Confederacy, but he could not conceal\r\nfrom himself that the first steps undertaken in that direction had been\r\npremature. From this first failure dated his fixed belief, no matter\r\nwhat hopes were sometimes expressed later, that only a change of\r\nGovernment in England would help the Southern cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: See _ante_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: See _ante_, pp. 61 and 65-66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: Russell Papers.

The fact that Slidell arrived in France just as Napoleon's plans\r\nfor Mexico took clearer form has been made the ground for assumptions\r\nthat he immediately gave assurance of Southern acquiescence and\r\nencouraged Napoleon to go forward. I have found no good evidence of\r\nthis--rather the contrary. The whole plan was clear to Cowley by\r\nmid-January before Slidell reached Paris, and Slidell's own\r\ncorrespondence shows no early push on Mexico. The Confederate agents'\r\ncorrespondence, both official and private, will be much used later in\r\nthis work and here requires explanation. But four historical works of\r\nimportance deal with it extensively, (1) Richardson, _Messages and\r\nPapers of the Confederacy_, 2 vols., 1905, purports to include the\r\ndespatches of Mason and Slidell to Richmond, but is very unsatisfactory.\r\nImportant despatches are missing, and elisions sometimes occur without\r\nindication. (2) Virginia Mason, _The Public Life and Diplomatic\r\nCorrespondence of James M. Mason_, 1906, contains most of Mason's\r\ndespatches, including some not given by Richardson. The author also used\r\nthe _Mason Papers_ (see below). (3) Callahan, _The Diplomatic History of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy_, 1901, is the most complete and authoritative\r\nwork on Southern diplomacy yet published. He used the collection known\r\nas the \"Pickett Papers,\" for official despatches, supplementing these\r\nwhen gaps occurred by a study of the _Mason Papers_, but his work,\r\nnarrative in form, permits no extended printing of documents. (4) L.M.\r\nSears, _A Confederate Diplomat at the Court of Napoleon III_. (Am. Hist.\r\nRev. Jan., 1921), is a study drawn from Slidell's private letters in the\r\n_Mason Papers_. The Mason Papers exist in eight folios or packages in\r\nthe Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, and in addition\r\nthere is one bound volume of Mason's despatches to Richmond. These\r\ncontain the private correspondence of Mason and Slidell while in Europe.\r\nSlidell's letters are originals. Mason's letters are copies in Slidell's\r\nhand-writing, made apparently at Mason's request and sent to him in May,\r\n1865. A complete typed copy of this correspondence was taken by me in\r\n1913, but this has not hitherto been used save in a manuscript Master's\r\ndegree thesis by Walter M. Case, \"James M.

Did Russell have this in mind when he\r\npromptly incorporated Mason's figures in the papers presented to\r\nParliament? These figures showed that according to reports from four\r\nSouthern ports, sixty vessels had entered and cleared between April 29\r\nand October 31, 1861; unauthenticated statistics extending to the date\r\nDecember 31, presented by Mason of vessels arrived at and departing from\r\nCuban ports showed forty-eight vessels, each way engaged in blockade\r\nrunning. Seven of these were listed as \"captured.\" Those reaching Cuba\r\nwere described as twenty-six British, 14 Confederate, 3 Spanish, 3\r\nAmerican and 2 Mexican, but in none of these statistics were the names\r\nof the vessels given, for obvious reasons, in the printed paper though\r\napparently included in the list submitted by Mason. These figures did in\r\nfact but reveal a situation existing even after 1861. The American\r\nblockading fleets had to be created from all sorts of available material\r\nand were slow in getting under way. Regular ships of the old Navy could\r\nnot enforce it being too few in number, and also, at first, directing\r\ntheir efforts to the capture of shore positions which would render a\r\nlarge blockading squadron unnecessary. This proved an abortive effort\r\nand it was not until 1862 that the development of a large fleet of\r\nblockaders was seriously undertaken. (See _Fox, Confid. Corresp._, I,\r\npp. 110, 115, 119 and especially 122, which, May 31, 1862, pays tribute\r\nto the energy with which the South for \"thirteen long months\" had\r\ndefended its important port shore lines.) If Gregory had been able to\r\nquote a report by Bunch from Charleston of April 5, 1862, he would have\r\nhad a strong argument. \"The blockade runners are doing a great\r\nbusiness.... Everything is brought in in abundance. Not a day passes\r\nwithout an arrival or a departure. The Richmond Government sent about a\r\nmonth ago an order to Nassau for Medicines, Quinine, etc. It went from\r\nNassau to New York, was executed there, came back to Nassau, thence\r\nhere, and was on its way to Richmond in 21 days from the date of the\r\norder. Nearly all the trade is under the British flag. The vessels are\r\nall changed in Nassau and Havana. Passengers come and go freely and no\r\none seems to think that there is the slightest risk--which, indeed,\r\nthere is not.\" (Lyons Papers. Bunch to Lyons, April 5, 1862).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: I have nowhere found any such statement by Seward.\r\nGregory's reference is to a note from Seward to Lyons of May 27, 1861,\r\nprinted in the Blockade Papers. This merely holds that temporary absence\r\nof blockading ships does not impair the blockade nor render \"necessary a\r\nnew notice of its existence.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: _A Cycle of Adams' Letters_, I, pp. 119-20.

The\r\nRussian Ambassador in London gave a different interpretation. He wrote\r\nthat the Northern victories in the West had caused Great Britain to\r\nthink the time near when the \"border states,\" now tied to the Union by\r\nthese victories, would lead in a pacification on lines of separation\r\nfrom the Southern slave states. \"It is in this sense, and no other that\r\nRussell's 'three months' speech in the Lords is to be taken.\" (Brunow to\r\nF.O., March 3-15, 1862. No. 33). Brunow does not so state, but his\r\ndespatch sounds as if this were the result of a talk with Russell. If\r\nso, it would indicate an attempt to interpret Lincoln's \"border state\r\npolicy\" in a sense that would appear reasonable in the British view that\r\nthere could be no real hope at Washington of restoring the Union.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: Mason, _Mason_, p. 264.

LINDSAY\r\n\r\nThe friendly atmosphere created by the lifting of the threatening\r\n_Trent_ episode, appears to have made Secretary Seward believe that the\r\nmoment was opportune for a renewal of pressure on Great Britain and\r\nFrance for the recall of their Proclamations of Neutrality. Seizing upon\r\nthe victories of Grant at Forts Henry and Donelson, he wrote to Adams on\r\nFebruary 28 explaining that as a result the United States, now having\r\naccess to the interior districts of Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas,\r\n\"had determined to permit the restoration of trade upon our inland ways\r\nand waters\" under certain limitations, and that if this experiment\r\nsucceeded similar measures would be applied \"to the country on the\r\nsea-coast, which would be some alleviation of the rigour of the\r\nblockade.\" He added that these \"concessions\" to foreign nations would\r\n\"go much further and faster\" if those nations would withdraw their\r\n\"belligerent privileges heretofore so unnecessarily conceded, as we\r\nconceive, to the insurgents[580].\" This was large talk for a relatively\r\nunchanged military situation. Grant had as yet but forced open the door\r\nin the West and was still far from having \"access to the interior\r\ndistricts\" of the states named. Lyons, being shown a copy of this\r\ndespatch to Adams, commented to Russell that while it might be said the\r\nposition and the spirit of the Northern armies were greatly improved and\r\nnotable successes probable, it could not be maintained that hostilities\r\nwere \"so near their conclusion or are carried on upon so small a scale\r\nas to disqualify either party for the title of Belligerents[581].\" Lyons\r\nand Mercier were agreed that this was no time for the withdrawal of\r\nbelligerent rights to the South, and when the hint was received that the\r\npurpose of making such a request was in Seward's mind, the news quite\r\ntook Thouvenel's breath away[582]. As yet, however, Seward did no more\r\nthan hint and Adams was quick to advise that the moment had not yet come\r\n\"when such a proceeding might seem to me likely to be of use[583].\"\r\n\r\nJust at this time Seward was engaged in forwarding a measure no doubt\r\nintended to secure British anti-slavery sympathy for the North, yet also\r\ntruly indicative of a Northern temper toward the South and its \"domestic\r\ninstitution.\" This was the negotiation of a Slave-Trade treaty with\r\nGreat Britain, by which America joined, at last, the nations agreeing to\r\nunite their efforts in suppression of the African Slave Trade. The\r\ntreaty was signed by Seward and Lyons at Washington on April 7. On the\r\nnext day Seward wrote to Adams that had such a treaty been ratified \"in\r\n1808, there would now have been no sedition here, and no disagreement\r\nbetween the United States and foreign nations[584],\" a melancholy\r\nreflection intended to suggest that the South alone had been responsible\r\nfor the long delay of American participation in a world humanitarian\r\nmovement. But the real purpose of the treaty, Lyons thought, was \"to\r\nsave the credit of the President with the Party which elected him if he\r\nshould make concessions to the South, with a view of reconstructing the\r\nUnion[585]\"--an erroneous view evincing a misconception of the\r\nintensity of both Northern and Southern feeling if regarded from our\r\npresent knowledge, but a view natural enough to the foreign observer at\r\nthe moment. Lyons, in this letter, correctly stated the rising\r\ndetermination of the North to restore the Union, but underestimated the\r\nrapid growth of an equal determination against a restoration with\r\nslavery. The real motive for Seward's eagerness to sign the Slave Trade\r\ntreaty was the thought of its influence on foreign, not domestic,\r\naffairs. Lyons, being confident that Russell would approve, had taken\r\n\"the risk of going a little faster\" than his instructions had\r\nindicated[586].\r\n\r\nIn this same letter Lyons dwelt upon the Northern elation over recent\r\nmilitary successes. The campaign in the West had been followed in the\r\nEast by a great effort under McClellan to advance on Richmond up the\r\npeninsula of the James river and using Chesapeake Bay as a means of\r\nwater transportation and supply. This campaign had been threatened by\r\nthe appearance of the iron-clad ram _Merrimac_ and her attack on the\r\nwooden naval vessels operating in support of McClellan, but on March 9\r\nthe _Monitor_, a slow-moving floating iron-clad fortress, drove the\r\n_Merrimac_ from her helpless prey, and removed the Southern threat to\r\nMcClellan's communications. More than any other one battle of the Civil\r\nWar the duel between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ struck the\r\nimagination of the British people, and justly so because of its\r\nsignificance in relation to the power of the British Navy. It \"has been\r\nthe main talk of the town,\" wrote Adams, \"ever since the news came, in\r\nParliament, in the clubs, in the city, among the military and naval\r\npeople. The impression is that it dates the commencement of a new era in\r\nwarfare, and that Great Britain must consent to begin over again[587].\"\r\nThe victory of the _Monitor_ was relatively unimportant in British\r\neyes, but a fight between two completely armoured ships, and especially\r\nthe ease with which the _Merrimac_ had vanquished wooden ships on the\r\nday previous, were cause of anxious consideration for the future.\r\nRussell was more concerned over the immediate lessons of the battle.\r\n\"Only think,\" he wrote, \"of our position if in case of the Yankees\r\nturning upon us they should by means of iron ships renew the triumphs\r\nthey achieved in 1812-13 by means of superior size and weight of\r\nmetal[588].\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but early and hasty speculation, and while American\r\ningenuity and experiment in naval warfare had, indeed, sounded the\r\ndeath-knell of wooden ships of war, no great change in the character of\r\nnavies was immediately possible. Moreover British shipbuilders could\r\nsurely keep pace in iron-clad construction with America or any other\r\nnation. The success of the _Monitor_ was soon regarded by the British\r\nGovernment as important mainly as indicative of a new energy in the\r\nNorth promising further and more important successes on land. The\r\nGovernment hoped for such Northern success not because of any belief\r\nthat these would go to the extent of forcing the South into submission,\r\nfor they were still, and for a long time to come, obsessed with the\r\nconviction that Southern independence must ultimately be achieved. The\r\nidea was, rather, that the North, having vindicated its fighting ability\r\nand realizing that the South, even though losing battle after battle,\r\nwas stubborn in the will to independence, would reach the conclusion\r\nthat the game was not worth the price and would consent to separation.\r\nRussell wrote in this vein to Lyons, even though he thought that the\r\n\"morale of the Southern army seems to be ruined for the time[589].\" He\r\nbelieved that the end of the war would be hastened by Northern\r\nvictories, and he therefore rejoiced in them.\r\n\r\nOf somewhat like opinion up to the end of March, 1862, Lyons, in April,\r\nbegan to doubt his previous analysis of Northern temper and to write\r\nwarnings that the end was not near. Grant's hard-won victory in the West\r\nat Shiloh, April 6-7, the first great pitched battle of the war, called\r\nout such a flood of Northern expressions of determination to drive the\r\nwar to the bitter end as to startle Lyons and cause him, in a remarkably\r\nclear letter of survey, to recast his opinions. He wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The general opinion is that the Campaign of this Spring will\r\n     clear up most of the doubts as to the result of the War. If\r\n     the Military successes of the North continue, the\r\n     determination of the South, will (it is asserted) be at last\r\n     really put to the test. If notwithstanding great Military\r\n     reverses, the loss of the Border States, and the occupation\r\n     of the most important points on the Coast, the Southern men\r\n     hold out, if they destroy as they threaten to do, their\r\n     cotton, tobacco and all other property which cannot be\r\n     removed and then retire into the interior with their families\r\n     and slaves, the Northern Conquests may prove to be but\r\n     barren. The climate may be a fatal enemy to the Federal\r\n     Armies. The Northern people may be unable or unwilling to\r\n     continue the enormous expenditure. They may prefer Separation\r\n     to protracting the War indefinitely. I confess, however, that\r\n     I fear that a protraction of the War during another year or\r\n     longer, is a not less probable result of the present posture\r\n     of affairs, than either the immediate subjugation of the\r\n     South or the immediate recognition of its independence[590].\"\r\n\r\nThis itemization of Southern methods of resistance was in line with\r\nConfederate threats at a moment when the sky looked black. There was\r\nindeed much Southern talk of \"retiring\" into a hypothetical defensible\r\ninterior which impressed Englishmen, but had no foundation in\r\ngeographical fact. Meanwhile British attention was eagerly fixed on the\r\nNorthern advance, and it was at least generally hoped that the\r\nprojected attack on New Orleans and McClellan's advance up the peninsula\r\ntoward Richmond would bring to a more definite status the conflict in\r\nAmerica. Extreme Southern sympathizers scouted the possibility of any\r\nconclusive Northern success, ignoring, because ignorant, the importance\r\nof Grant's western campaign. They \"were quite struck aback\" by the news\r\nof the capture of New Orleans, April 25. \"It took them three days to\r\nmake up their minds to believe it[591],\" but even the capture of this\r\nthe most important commercial city of the South was not regarded as of\r\ngreat importance in view of the eastern effort toward Richmond.\r\n\r\nNews of the operations in the peninsula was as slow in reaching England\r\nas was McClellan's slow and cautious advance. It was during this advance\r\nand previous to the capture of New Orleans that two remarkable\r\nadventures toward a solution in America were made, apparently wholly on\r\nindividual initiative, by a Frenchman in America and an Englishman in\r\nFrance. Mercier at Washington and Lindsay at Paris conceived, quite\r\nindependently, that the time had come for projects of foreign mediation.\r\n\r\nFrench opinion, like that expressed in England, appears to have been\r\nthat the Northern successes in the spring of 1862 might result in such a\r\nrehabilitation of Northern self-esteem that suggestions of now\r\nrecognizing the _facts_ of the situation and acknowledging the\r\nindependence of the South would not be unfavourably received. In this\r\nsense Thouvenel wrote to Mercier, privately, on March 13, but was\r\ncareful to state that the word \"mediation\" ought not to be uttered. His\r\nletter dilated, also, on French manufacturing difficulties at home due\r\nto the lack of cotton[592]. This was in no way an instruction to\r\nMercier, but the ideas expressed were broached by him in a conversation\r\nwith Seward, only to be met with such positive assertions of intention\r\nand ability soon to recover the South as somewhat to stagger the French\r\nMinister. He remarked, according to his report to Thouvenel, that he\r\nwished it were possible to visit Richmond and assure himself that there\r\nalso they recognized the truth of Seward's statements, upon which the\r\nlatter at once offered to further such a trip. Mercier asserted to\r\nThouvenel that he was taken by surprise, having foreseen no such eager\r\nacquiescence in a suggestion made _without previous thought_, but that\r\non consideration he returned to Seward and accepted the proposal,\r\noutlining the substance of what he intended to say at Richmond. He\r\nshould there make clear that the anxiety of France was above all\r\ndirected toward peace as essential to French commercial interests; that\r\nFrance had always regarded the separation of North and South with\r\nregret; that the North was evidently determined in its will to restore\r\nthe Union; and, in repetition, that France wished to aid in any way\r\npossible the early cessation of war. Seward, wrote Mercier, told him to\r\nadd that he, personally, would welcome \"the presence in the Senate\" of\r\nany persons whom the South wished to elect[593].\r\n\r\nMercier, writes Bancroft, \"from the first had been an impatient\r\nsympathizer with the Confederacy, and he was quite devoid of the balance\r\nand good judgment that characterized Lord Lyons.\" \"Quite unnecessarily,\r\nSeward helped him to make the trip[594].\" A circumstance apparently not\r\nknown to Bancroft was Mercier's consultation with Lyons, before\r\ndeparture, in which were revealed an initiative of the adventure, and a\r\nproposed representation to the authorities in Richmond materially\r\ndifferent from the report made by Mercier to Thouvenel. These merit\r\nexpanded treatment as new light on a curious episode and especially as\r\nrevealing the British policy of the moment, represented in the person of\r\nthe British Minister in Washington[595].\r\n\r\nOn April 10 Mercier came to Lyons, told him that he was about to set out\r\nfor Richmond and that he had \"been for some little time thinking of\r\nmaking this journey.\" He told of _making the suggestion to Seward_, and\r\nthat this \"rather to his surprise\" had been \"eagerly\" taken up.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur Mercier observed that the object of vital\r\n     importance to France, and to England also, as he supposed,\r\n     was to put an end, as soon as possible, to the blockade, and\r\n     generally to a state of things which caused so grievous an\r\n     interruption of the trade between Europe and this country. It\r\n     was, he said, possible that he might hasten the attainment of\r\n     this object by conferring personally with the Secession\r\n     leaders. He should frankly tell them that to all appearances\r\n     their cause was desperate; that their Armies were beaten in\r\n     all quarters; and that the time had arrived when they ought\r\n     to come to some arrangement, which would put an end to a\r\n     state of affairs ruinous to themselves and intolerable to\r\n     Europe. It was useless to expect any countenance from the\r\n     European Powers. Those Powers could but act on their avowed\r\n     principles. They would recognize any people which\r\n     established its independence, but they could not encourage\r\n     the prolongation of a fruitless struggle.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur Mercier thought that if the Confederates were very\r\n     much discouraged by their recent reverses, such language from\r\n     the Minister of a great European Power might be a knock-down\r\n     blow ('Coup d'assommoir' was the expression he used) to them.\r\n     It might induce them to come to terms with the North. At all\r\n     events it might lead to an Armistice, under which trade might\r\n     be immediately resumed. He had (he told me) mentioned to Mr.\r\n     Seward his notion of using this language, and had added that\r\n     of course as a Minister accredited to the United States, and\r\n     visiting Richmond with the consent of the United States\r\n     Government, he could not speak to the Southern men of any\r\n     other terms for ending the War than a return to the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur Mercier proceeded to say that Mr. Seward entirely\r\n     approved of the language he thus proposed to hold, and had\r\n     authorized him to say to the Southern leaders, not of course\r\n     from the United States Government, but from him Mr. Seward,\r\n     personally, that they had no spirit of vengeance to\r\n     apprehend, that they would be cordially welcomed back to\r\n     their Seats in the Senate, and to their due share of\r\n     political influence. Mr. Seward added that he had not said so\r\n     much to any other person, but that he would tell Monsieur\r\n     Mercier that he was willing to risk his own political station\r\n     and reputation in pursuing a conciliatory course towards the\r\n     South, that he was ready to make this his policy and to stand\r\n     or fall by it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly sufficiently strong language to have pleased the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State, and if actually used at Richmond to have\r\nconstituted Mercier a valuable Northern agent. It cannot be regarded as\r\nat all in harmony with Mercier's previous opinions, nor as expressive of\r\nThouvenel's views. Lyons was careful to refrain from much comment on the\r\nmatter of Mercier's proposed representations at Richmond. He was more\r\nconcerned that the trip was to be made at all; was in fact much opposed\r\nto it, fearing that it would appear like a break in that unity of\r\nFrench-British attitude which was so desirable. Nor was he without\r\nsuspicion of a hidden French purpose to secure some special and separate\r\nadvantages in the way of prospective commercial relations with the\r\nSouth. Mercier told Lyons that he knew he could not ask Lyons to\r\naccompany him because of American \"extreme susceptibility\" to any\r\ninterference by Great Britain, but he thought of taking Stoeckl, the\r\nRussian Minister, and that Stoeckl was \"pleased with the idea.\" Lyons\r\nfrankly replied that he was glad to be relieved of the necessity of\r\ndeclining to go and was sorry Mercier was determined to proceed since\r\nthis certainly looked like a break in \"joint policy,\" and he objected\r\npositively on the same ground to Stoeckl's going[596]. Mercier yielded\r\nthe latter point, but argued that by informing Seward of his\r\nconsultation with Lyons, which he proposed doing, the former objection\r\nwould be obviated. Finding that Mercier \"was bent on going,\" Lyons\r\nthought it best not to object too much and confined his efforts to\r\ndriving home the idea that no opening should be given for a \"separate\r\nagreement\" with the South.\r\n\r\n     \"I therefore entered with him into the details of his plans,\r\n     and made some suggestions as to his language and conduct. I\r\n     said that one delusion which he might find it desirable to\r\n     remove from the minds of men in the South, was that it would\r\n     be possible to inveigle France or any other great European\r\n     Power into an exclusive Alliance with them. I had reason to\r\n     believe that some of them imagine that this might be effected\r\n     by an offer of great commercial privileges to one Power, to\r\n     the exclusion of others. I hardly supposed that Mr. Jefferson\r\n     Davis himself, or men of his stamp could entertain so foolish\r\n     a notion, but still it might be well to eradicate it from any\r\n     mind in which it had found place[597].\"\r\n\r\nLyons saw Mercier \"two or three times\" between the tenth and fourteenth\r\nand on the twelfth spoke to Seward about the trip, \"without saying\r\nanything to lead him to suppose that I had any objection to it.\" This\r\nwas intended to preserve the impression of close harmony with France,\r\nand Lyons wrote, \"I consider that the result of my communications with\r\nM. Mercier entitles him to say that he makes his journey to Richmond\r\nwith my acquiescence[598].\" Nevertheless he both believed, and declared\r\nto Mercier, that the views expressed on Southern weakening of\r\ndetermination were wholly erroneous, and that neither North nor South\r\nwas ready for any efforts, still less mediation, looking toward peace.\r\nHe prophesied failure of Mercier's avowed hopes. His prophecy proved\r\nwell founded. On April 28 Lyons reported Mercier's account to him of the\r\nresults of the journey. Mercier returned to Washington on April 24,\r\nreported at once to Seward the results of his trip, and on the same day\r\ncalled on Lyons. Having conversed with Benjamin, the new Confederate\r\nSecretary of State, he was now wholly convinced of the settled\r\ndetermination of the South to maintain its independence, even under\r\nextreme reverses. Upon enquiry by Lyons whether the South expected\r\nEuropean assistance, Mercier \"replied that the Confederate leaders\r\nprofessed to have abandoned all hope of succour from Europe,\" and that\r\nconfident in their own power they \"desired no aid.\" Cautiously adverting\r\nto his suspicion that Mercier's trip might have had in view French\r\ncommercial advantage, Lyons asked whether France had received any\r\nproposals of benefit in return for recognition. Mercier answered with a\r\nsimple negative. He then further developed the interview with\r\nBenjamin[599].\r\n\r\n     \"He said that he had spoken while at Richmond as a friend of\r\n     the Union, and a friend of all parties, but that the\r\n     particular language which he had intended to hold was\r\n     entirely inapplicable to the state of mind in which he found\r\n     the Confederates one and all. It was idle to tell them that\r\n     they were worsted on all sides; that the time was come for\r\n     making terms with the North. What he had said to them about\r\n     the recognition of their Independence was that the principal\r\n     inducement to France to recognize it would be a hope that her\r\n     doing so would have a great moral effect towards hastening\r\n     peace; that at this moment it would certainly not have any\r\n     such effect; that it would embroil France with the United\r\n     States, and that would be all[600].\"\r\n\r\nThus none of the strong representations intended to be made by Mercier\r\nto convince the South of the uselessness of further resistance had, in\r\nfact, been made. In his report to Thouvenel, Mercier stated that he had\r\napproached Benjamin with the simple declaration \"that the purpose of my\r\njourney was merely to assure myself, for myself, of the true condition\r\nof things; and that I called to beg him to aid me in attaining it.\"\r\nSince the proposed strong representations were not reported to\r\nThouvenel, either, in the explanation given of the initiation of the\r\ntrip, the doubt must be entertained that Mercier ever intended to make\r\nthem. They bear the appearance of arguments to Seward--and in some\r\ndegree also to Lyons--made to secure acquiescence in his plan. The\r\nreport to Thouvenel omits also any reference to expressions, as narrated\r\nto Lyons, about recognition of the Confederacy, or a \"principal\r\ninducement\" thereto[601]. Mercier now declared to Lyons his own views on\r\nrecognition:\r\n\r\n     \"He was himself more than ever convinced that the restoration\r\n     of the old Union was impossible. He believed that, if the\r\n     Powers of Europe exercised no influence, the War would last\r\n     for years. He conceived that the Independence of the South\r\n     must be recognized sooner or later; and in his opinion the\r\n     Governments of Europe should be on the watch for a favourable\r\n     opportunity of doing this in such a manner as to end the War.\r\n     The present opportunity would however, he thought, be\r\n     particularly unfavourable.\"\r\n\r\nLyons writes:\r\n\r\n     \"I did not express any opinion as to the policy to be\r\n     eventually pursued by France or England, but I told Monsieur\r\n     Mercier that I entirely agreed with him in thinking that\r\n     there was nothing to do at the present moment but to watch\r\n     events.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following this interview, Lyons spoke to Seward of Mercier's\r\ntrip and was given a very different view of the situation at Richmond.\r\nSeward said:\r\n\r\n     \"He himself was quite convinced, from Monsieur Mercier's\r\n     account of what had passed, that the Confederates were about\r\n     to make a last effort, that their last resources were brought\r\n     into play; that their last Armies were in the field. If they\r\n     were now defeated, they would accept the terms which would be\r\n     offered them. Their talking of retiring into the interior was\r\n     idle. If the United States were undisputed masters of the\r\n     Border States and the Sea Coast, there would be no occasion\r\n     for any more fighting. Those who chose to retire into the\r\n     interior were welcome to do so, and to stay there till they\r\n     were tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth,\" wrote Lyons, \"as to the state of feeling in the South\r\nprobably lies somewhere between Mr. Seward's views and those of Monsieur\r\nMercier.\" Lyons concluded his report of the whole matter:\r\n\r\n     \"The result of Monsieur Mercier's journey has been to bring\r\n     him back precisely to the point at which he was three months\r\n     ago. The Federal successes which occurred afterwards had\r\n     somewhat shaken his conviction in the ultimate success of the\r\n     South, and consequently his opinions as to the policy to be\r\n     adopted by France. The sentiments he now expresses are\r\n     exactly those which he expressed at the beginning of the\r\n     year[602].\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Mercier was now again pressing for early recognition of\r\nthe South at the first favourable moment. On Lyons the effect of the\r\nadventure to Richmond was just the reverse of this; and on Russell also\r\nits influence was to cause some doubt of Southern success. Appended to\r\nLyons' report stands Russell's initialled comment:\r\n\r\n     \"It is desirable to know what is the Interior to which the\r\n     Southern Confederates propose if beaten to retire. If in Arms\r\n     they will be pursued, if not in Arms their discontent will\r\n     cause but little embarrassment to their Conquerors. But can\r\n     the country be held permanently by the U.S. Armies if the\r\n     Confederates have small bodies in Arms resisting the\r\n     authority of the U.S. Congress?\r\n\r\n     Any facts shewing the strength or weakness of the Union\r\n     feeling in the South will be of great value in forming a\r\n     judgment on the final issue.\"\r\n\r\nSeward, in conversation with Lyons, had said that to avoid public\r\nmisconceptions a newspaper statement would be prepared on Mercier's\r\ntrip. This appeared May 6, in the New York _Times_, the paper more\r\nclosely Seward's \"organ\" than any other throughout the war, representing\r\nMercier as having gone to Richmond by order of Napoleon and with\r\nLincoln's approval to urge the Confederates to surrender and to\r\nencourage them to expect favourable terms. Lyons commented on this\r\narticle that the language attributed to Mercier was \"not very unlike\r\nthat which he intended to hold,\" but that in fact he had not used\r\nit[603]. Nor had Napoleon ordered the move. Indeed everyone in London\r\nand Paris was much astonished, and many were the speculations as to the\r\nmeaning of Mercier's unusual procedure. Russell was puzzled, writing\r\n\"Que diable allait il faire dans cette galére[604]?\" and Cowley, at\r\nParis, could give no light, being assured by Thouvenel on first rumours\r\nof Mercier's trip to Richmond that \"he had not a notion that this could\r\nbe true[605].\" May 1, Cowley wrote, \"The whole thing is inexplicable\r\nunless the Emperor is at the bottom of it, which Thouvenel thinks is not\r\nthe case[606].\" The next day Thouvenel, having consulted Napoleon, was\r\nassured by the latter that \"he could not account for Monsieur Mercier's\r\nconduct, and that he greatly regretted it,\" being especially disturbed\r\nby a seeming break in the previous \"complete harmony with the British\r\nRepresentative\" at Washington[607]. This was reassuring to Russell, yet\r\nthere is no question that Mercier's conduct long left a certain\r\nsuspicion in British official circles. On May 2, also, Thouvenel wrote\r\nto Flahault in London of the Emperor's displeasure, evidently with the\r\nintention that this should be conveyed to Russell[608].\r\n\r\nNaturally the persons most excited were the two Confederate agents in\r\nEurope. At first they believed Mercier must have had secret orders from\r\nNapoleon, and were delighted; then on denials made to Slidell by\r\nThouvenel they feared Mercier was acting in an unfavourable sense as\r\nSeward's agent. Later they returned to the theory of Napoleon's private\r\nmanipulation, and being confident of his friendship were content to wait\r\nevents[609]. Slidell had just received assurance from M. Billault,\r\nthrough whom most of his information came, \"that the Emperor and all\r\nthe Ministers are favourable to our cause, have been so for the last\r\nyear, and are now quite as warmly so as they have ever been. M.\r\nThouvenel is of course excepted, but then he has no hostility[610].\" But\r\na greater source of Southern hope at this juncture was another\r\n\"diplomatic adventure,\" though by no accredited diplomat, which\r\nantedated Mercier's trip to Richmond and which still agitated not only\r\nthe Confederate agents, but the British Ministry as well.\r\n\r\nThis was the appearance of the British Member of Parliament, Lindsay, in\r\nthe rôle of self-constituted Southern emissary to Napoleon. Lindsay, as\r\none of the principal ship-owners in England, had long been an earnest\r\nadvocate of more free commercial intercourse between nations, supporting\r\nin general the principles of Cobden and Bright, and being a warm\r\npersonal friend of the latter, though disagreeing with him on the\r\nAmerican Civil War. He had been in some sense a minor expert consulted\r\nby both French and British Governments in the preparation of the\r\ncommercial treaty of 1860, so that when on April 9 he presented himself\r\nto Cowley asking that an audience with the Emperor be procured for him\r\nto talk over some needed alterations in the Navigation Laws, the request\r\nseemed reasonable, and the interview was arranged for April 11. On the\r\ntwelfth Lindsay reported to Cowley that the burden of Napoleon's\r\nconversation, much to his surprise, was on American affairs[611].\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, said Lindsay, expressed the conviction that re-union\r\nbetween North and South was an impossibility, and declared that he was\r\nready to recognize the South \"if Great Britain would set him the\r\nexample.\" More than once he had expressed these ideas to England, but\r\n\"they had not been attended to\" and he should not try again. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     \"... that France ought not to interfere in the internal\r\n     affairs of the United States, but that the United States\r\n     ought equally to abstain from all interference in the\r\n     internal concerns of France; and that His Majesty considered\r\n     that the hindrance placed by the Northern States upon the\r\n     exportation of cotton from the South was not justifiable, and\r\n     was tantamount to interference with the legal commerce of\r\n     France.\"\r\n\r\nHe also \"denied the efficiency of the blockade so established. He had\r\nmade observations in this sense to Her Majesty's Government, but they\r\nhad not been replied to.\" Then \"His Majesty asked what were the opinions\r\nof Her Majesty's Govt.; adding that if Her Majesty's Govt. agreed with\r\nhim as to the inefficiency of the blockade, he was ready to send ships\r\nof war to co-operate with others of Her Majesty to keep the Southern\r\nports open.\" Finally Napoleon requested Lindsay to see Cowley and find\r\nout what he thought of these ideas.\r\n\r\nCowley told Lindsay he did not know of any \"offer\" whatever having been\r\nmade by France to England, that his (Cowley's) opinion was \"that it\r\nmight be true that the North and the South would never re-unite, but\r\nthat it was not yet proved; that the efficiency of the blockade was a\r\nlegal and international question, and that upon the whole it had been\r\nconsidered by Her Majesty's Govt. as efficient, though doubtless many\r\nships had been enabled to run it\"; and \"that at all events there could\r\nnot be a more inopportune moment for mooting the question both of the\r\nrecognition of the South and of the efficiency of the blockade. The\r\ntime was gone by when such measures could, if ever, have been taken--for\r\nevery mail brought news of expeditions from the North acting with\r\nsuccess upon the South; and every day added to the efficiency of the\r\nblockade\"; and \"that I did not think therefore that Her Majesty's Govt.\r\nwould consent to send a squadron to act as the Emperor had indicated,\r\nbut that I could only give a personal opinion, which might be corrected\r\nif I was in error by Mr. Lindsay himself seeing Lord Russell.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 13th a second interview took place between Lindsay and\r\nNapoleon, of which Lindsay reported that having conveyed to Napoleon\r\nCowley's denial of any offer made to England, as well as a contrary view\r\nof the situation, Napoleon:\r\n\r\n     \"... repeated the statement that two long despatches with his\r\n     opinion had been written to M. de Flahault, which had not\r\n     been attended to by Her Majesty's Government, and he\r\n     expressed a desire that Mr. Lindsay should return to London,\r\n     lay His Majesty's views before Lord Palmerston and Lord\r\n     Russell, and bring their answers direct to him as quickly as\r\n     possible, His Majesty observing that these matters were\r\n     better arranged by private than official hands.... Mr.\r\n     Lindsay said that he had promised the Emperor to be back in\r\n     Paris on Thursday morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Russell, Cowley called all this a \"nasty intrigue.\"\r\nCowley had asked Thouvenel for enlightenment, and Thouvenel had denied\r\nall knowledge and declared that certainly no such proposals as Lindsay\r\nreported the Emperor to have mentioned had ever been sent to England.\r\nCowley wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"My own conviction is, from Lindsay's conversations with me,\r\n     which are full of hesitations, and I fear much falsehood\r\n     hidden under apparent candour, that he has told the Emperor\r\n     his own views, and that those views are supported by the\r\n     majority of the people of England, and by the present\r\n     Opposition in Parliament, who would denounce the blockade if\r\n     in power; that he has found a willing listener in the\r\n     Emperor, who would gladly obtain cotton by any means; and I\r\n     am much mistaken if Lindsay will not attempt to make\r\n     political capital of his interviews with the Emperor with the\r\n     Opposition, and that you may hear of it in Parliament. I lose\r\n     no time therefore, in writing to you as Lindsay goes over\r\n     to-night, and will probably endeavour to see you and Lord\r\n     Palmerston as soon as possible[612].\"\r\n\r\nThe close touch between Lindsay and the Southern agents is shown by his\r\nconveyance to Slidell of the good news. Slidell was jubilant, writing\r\nto Mason:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Lindsay has had a long interview with the Emperor who is\r\n     prepared to act at once decidedly in our favour; he has\r\n     always been ready to do so and has twice made representations\r\n     to England, but has received evasive responses. He has now\r\n     for the third time given them but in a more decided tone. Mr.\r\n     Lindsay will give you all the particulars. This is entirely\r\n     confidential but you can say to Lord Campbell, Mr. Gregory,\r\n     etc., that I now have positive and _authoritative_ evidence\r\n     that France now waits the assent of England for recognition\r\n     and other more cogent measures[613].\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later Slidell made a report to Benjamin, which was in substance\r\nvery similar to that given by Lindsay to Cowley, though more highly\r\ncoloured as favourable to the South, but he added an important feature\r\nwhich, as has been seen, was suspected by Cowley, but which had not been\r\nstated to him. Napoleon had asked Lindsay to see Derby and Disraeli, the\r\nleaders of the parliamentary opposition, and inform them of his views--a\r\nsuggestion which if known to the British Ministry as coming from\r\nNapoleon could not fail to arouse resentment. Slidell even believed\r\nthat, failing British participation, the Emperor might act separately in\r\nrecognition of the South[614].\r\n\r\nApril 15, Cowley, having received, privately, Russell's approval of the\r\nlanguage used to Lindsay and believing that Thouvenel was about to write\r\nto Flahault on the interviews, felt it \"necessary to bring them also on\r\nmy part officially to your [Russell's] notice[615].\" This official\r\nreport does not differ materially from that in Cowley's private letter\r\nof the thirteenth, but omitted, naturally, aspersions on Lindsay and\r\nsuspicions of the use to which he might put his information[616]. Cowley\r\nhad held a long conversation with Thouvenel, in which it was developed\r\nthat the source of the Emperor's views was Rouher, Minister of Commerce,\r\nwho was very anxious over the future of cotton supply. It appeared that\r\nLindsay in conversation with Thouvenel had affirmed that \"_I_ [Cowley]\r\n_coincided in his views_.\" This exasperated Cowley, and he resented\r\nLindsay's \"unofficial diplomacy,\" telling Thouvenel that he \"was placed\r\nin a false position by Mr. Lindsay's interference. M. Thouvenel\r\nexclaimed that his own position was still more false, and that he should\r\nmake a point of seeing the Emperor, on the following morning, and of\r\nascertaining the extent of His Majesty's participation in the\r\nproceeding.\" This was done, with the result that Napoleon acknowledged\r\nthat on Lindsay's request he had authorized him to recount to Russell\r\nand Palmerston the views expressed, but asserted that \"he had not\r\ncharged him to convey those opinions.\" Cowley concluded his despatch:\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur Thouvenel said that the Emperor did not understand\r\n     the intricacies of this question--that His Majesty had\r\n     confounded remarks conveyed in despatches with deliberate\r\n     proposals--that no doubt the French Government was more\r\n     preoccupied with the Cotton question than Her Majesty's\r\n     Government seemed to be, and this he (Thouvenel) had shewn in\r\n     his communications with M. de Flahault, but that he knew too\r\n     well the general opinions prevailing in England to have made\r\n     proposals. Nor, indeed, did he see what proposals could have\r\n     been made. He had endeavoured to shew both the Emperor and M.\r\n     Rouher, that to recognize the independence of the South would\r\n     not bring Cotton into the markets, while any interference\r\n     with the blockade would probably have produced a collision.\r\n     At the same time he could not conceal from me the just\r\n     anxiety he experienced to reopen the Cotton trade. Might not\r\n     the Northern States be induced to declare some one port\r\n     Neutral, at which the trade could be carried on?\r\n\r\n     I said that the events which were now passing in America\r\n     demonstrated the prudence of the policy pursued by the two\r\n     Governments. The recognition of the South would not have\r\n     prevented the North from continuing its armaments and\r\n     undertaking the expedition now in progress, and a refusal to\r\n     acknowledge the blockade as efficient must have been followed\r\n     by the employment of force, on a question of extreme\r\n     delicacy[617].\"\r\n\r\nFormal approval was given Cowley by Russell on April 16. In this Russell\r\nstated that he agreed with Thouvenel the cotton situation was alarming,\r\nbut he added: \"The evil is evident--not equally so the remedy.\" He\r\nassured Cowley that \"Her Majesty's Government wish to take no step in\r\nrespect to the Civil War in America except in concert with France and\r\nupon full deliberation[618].\" Meanwhile Lindsay's diplomatic career had\r\nreceived a severe jolt in London. Confidently addressing to Russell a\r\nrequest for an interview, he received the reply \"that I thought the best\r\nway for two Govts. to communicate with each other was through their\r\nrespective Embassies.... He [Lindsay] rejoined that he feared you\r\n[Cowley] had not stated the reason why the Emperor wished to make the\r\nproposal through him rather than the usual channel, and again asked to\r\nsee me, but I declined to give any other answer, adding that you and the\r\nFrench Ambassr. could make the most Confidential as well as Official\r\nCommunications[619].\" This rebuff was not regarded as final, though\r\nexasperating, by Lindsay, nor by the Confederate agents, all being\r\nagreed that Napoleon was about to take an active hand in their favour.\r\nLindsay returned to Paris accompanied by Mason, and on April 18 had\r\nstill another conversation with Napoleon. He reported Russell's refusal\r\nof an interview, and that he had seen Disraeli, but not Derby, who was\r\nill. Disraeli had declared that he believed Russell and Seward to have a\r\n\"secret understanding\" on the blockade, but that if France should make a\r\ndefinite proposal it would probably be supported by a majority in\r\nParliament, and that Russell would be compelled to assent in order to\r\navoid a change of Ministry. In this third interview with Lindsay\r\nexpressions of vexation with British policy were used by Napoleon\r\n(according to Slidell), but he now intimated that he was waiting to\r\nlearn the result of the Northern effort to capture New Orleans, an event\r\nwhich \"he did not anticipate,\" but which, if it occurred, \"might render\r\nit inexpedient to act[620].\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the wedge was losing its force. Mason, returning to London,\r\nfound that the \"pulsations\" in Paris had no English repetition. He wrote\r\nthat Lindsay, failing to reach Russell, had attempted to get at\r\nPalmerston, but with no success. Thereupon Lindsay turning to the\r\nOpposition had visited Disraeli a second time and submitted to him\r\nPalmerston's rebuff. The strongest expression that fell from Disraeli\r\nwas--\"if it is found that the Emperor and Russell are at issue on the\r\nquestion the session of Parliament would not be as quiet as had been\r\nanticipated.\" This was scant encouragement, for Disraeli's \"if\" was all\r\nimportant. Yet \"on the whole Lindsay is hopeful,\" wrote Mason in\r\nconclusion[621]. Within a fortnight following arrived the news of the\r\ncapture of New Orleans, an event upon which Seward had postulated the\r\nrelief of a European scarcity of cotton and to Southern sympathizers a\r\nserious blow. May 13, Cowley reported that the Emperor had told him,\r\npersonally, that \"he quite agreed that nothing was to be done for the\r\nmoment but to watch events[622].\" Thouvenel asked Slidell as to the\r\neffect of the loss of New Orleans, and received the frank answer, \"that\r\nit would be most disastrous, as it would give the enemy the control of\r\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries, [but] that it would not in any way\r\nmodify the fixed purpose of our people to carry on the war even to an\r\nextermination[623].\" Mason, a Virginian, and like nearly all from his\r\nsection, never fully realizing the importance of the Confederate\r\nSouth-West, his eyes fixed on the campaigns about Richmond, was telling\r\nthe \"nervous amongst our friends\" that New Orleans would \"form a barren\r\nacquisition to the enemy, and will on our side serve only as a\r\nstimulant[624].\"\r\n\r\nIf the South needed such stimulants she was certainly getting repeated\r\ndoses in the three months from February to May, 1862. In England,\r\nLindsay might be hopeful of a movement by the Tory opposition, but\r\nthought it wiser to postpone for a time further pressure in that\r\ndirection. May 8, Henry Adams could write to his brother of British\r\npublic opinion, \"there is no doubt that the idea here is as strong as\r\never that we must ultimately fail[625],\" but on May 16, that \"the effect\r\nof the news here [of New Orleans] has been greater than anything yet ...\r\nthe _Times_ came out and gave fairly in that it had been mistaken; it\r\nhad believed Southern accounts and was deceived by them. This morning it\r\nhas an article still more remarkable and intimates for the first time\r\nthat it sees little more chance for the South. There is, we think, a\r\npreparation for withdrawing their belligerent declaration and\r\nacknowledging again the authority of the Federal Government over all the\r\nnational territory to be absolute and undisputed. One more victory will\r\nbring us up to this, I am confident[626].\"\r\n\r\nThis was mistaken confidence. Nor did governmental reaction keep pace\r\nwith Southern depression or Northern elation; the British Ministry was\r\nsimply made more determined to preserve strict neutrality and to\r\nrestrain its French partner in a \"wait for events\" policy. The \"one more\r\nvictory\" so eagerly desired by Henry Adams was not forthcoming, and the\r\nattention, now all focused on McClellan's slow-moving campaign, waited\r\nin vain for the demonstration of another and more striking evidence of\r\nNorthern power--the capture of the Confederate Capital, Richmond.\r\nMcClellan's delays coincided with a bruiting of the news at Washington\r\nthat foreign Powers were about to offer mediation. This was treated at\r\nsome length in the semi-official _National Intelligencer_ of May 16 in\r\nan article which Lyons thought inspired by Seward, stating that\r\nmediation would be welcome if offered for the purpose of re-union, but\r\nwould otherwise be resented, a view which Lyons thought fairly\r\nrepresented the situation[627].\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this Washington rumour was largely the\r\nresult of the very positive opinion held by Mercier of ultimate Southern\r\nsuccess and his somewhat free private communications. He may, indeed,\r\nhave been talking more freely than usual exactly because of anxiety at\r\nNorthern success, for McClellan, so far as was then known, was steadily,\r\nif slowly, progressing toward a victory. Mercier's most recent\r\ninstruction from Thouvenel gave him no authority to urge mediation, yet\r\nhe thought the moment opportune for it and strongly urged this plan on\r\nLyons. The latter's summary of this and his own analysis of the\r\nsituation were as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"M. Mercier thinks it quite within the range of possibility\r\n     that the South may be victorious both in the battle in\r\n     Virginia and in that in Tennessee. He is at all events quite\r\n     confident that whether victorious or defeated, they will not\r\n     give in, and he is certainly disposed to advise his\r\n     Government to endeavour to put an end to the war by\r\n     intervening on the first opportunity. He is, however, very\r\n     much puzzled to devise any mode of intervention, which would\r\n     have the effect of reviving French trade and obtaining\r\n     cotton. I should suppose he would think it desirable to go to\r\n     great lengths to stop the war; because he believes that the\r\n     South will not give in until the whole country is made\r\n     desolate and that the North will very soon be led to proclaim\r\n     immediate emancipation, which would stop the cultivation of\r\n     cotton for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\n     I listen and say little when he talks of intervention. It\r\n     appears to me to be a dangerous subject of conversation.\r\n     There is a good deal of truth in M. Mercier's anticipations\r\n     of evil, but I do not see my way to doing any good.\r\n\r\n     If one is to conjecture what the state of things will be a\r\n     month or six weeks hence, one may \"guess\" that McClellan will\r\n     be at Richmond, having very probably got there without much\r\n     real fighting. I doubt his getting farther this summer, if\r\n     so far....\r\n\r\n     The campaign will not be pushed with any vigour during the\r\n     summer. It may be begun again in the Autumn. Thus, so far as\r\n     Trade and Cotton are concerned, we may be next Autumn, just\r\n     in the situation we are now. If the South really defeated\r\n     either or both the Armies opposed to them I think it would\r\n     disgust the North with the war, rather than excite them to\r\n     fresh efforts. If the armies suffer much from disease,\r\n     recruiting will become difficult. The credit of the\r\n     Government has hitherto been wonderfully kept up, but it\r\n     would not stand a considerable reverse in the field. It is\r\n     possible, under such circumstances that a Peace Party might\r\n     arise; and perhaps just _possible_ that England and France\r\n     might give weight to such a Party[628].\"\r\n\r\nIn brief, Lyons was all against either intervention or mediation unless\r\na strong reaction toward peace should come in the North, and even then\r\nregarded the wisdom of such a policy as only \"just _possible_.\" Nor was\r\nRussell inclined to depart from established policy. He wrote to Lyons at\r\nnearly the same time:\r\n\r\n     \"The news from York Town, New Orleans, and Corinth seems to\r\n     portend the conquest of the South. We have now to see\r\n     therefore, whether a few leaders or the whole population\r\n     entertain those sentiments of alienation and abhorrence which\r\n     were so freely expressed to M. Mercier by the Confederate\r\n     Statesmen at Richmond. I know not how to answer this\r\n     question. But there are other questions not less important to\r\n     be solved in the North. Will the Abolitionists succeed in\r\n     proclaiming freedom to the Slaves of all those who have\r\n     resisted? I guess not.\r\n\r\n     But then the Union will be restored with its old disgrace and\r\n     its old danger. I confess I do not see any way to any fair\r\n     solution except separation--but that the North will not hear\r\n     of--nor in the moment of success would it be of any use to\r\n     give them unpalatable advice[629].\"\r\n\r\nTwo days preceding this letter, Thouvenel, at last fully informed of\r\nMercier's trip to Richmond, instructed him that France had no intention\r\nto depart from her attitude of strict neutrality and that it was more\r\nthan ever necessary to wait events[630].\r\n\r\nMercier's renewed efforts to start a movement toward mediation were then\r\nwholly personal. Neither France nor Great Britain had as yet taken up\r\nthis plan, nor were they likely to so long as Northern successes were\r\ncontinued. In London, Mason, suffering a reaction from his former high\r\nhopes, summed up the situation in a few words: \"This Government passive\r\nand ignorant, France alert and mysterious. The Emperor alone knows what\r\nis to come out of it, and he keeps his own secret[631].\" The Southern\r\nplay, following the ministerial rebuff to Lindsay, was now to keep quiet\r\nand extended even to discouraging public demonstrations against\r\ngovernmental inaction. Spence had prevented such a demonstration by\r\ncotton operators in Liverpool. \"I have kept them from moving as a matter\r\nof judgment. If either of the Southern armies obtain such a victory as I\r\nthink probable, then a move of this kind may be made with success and\r\npower, whilst at the wrong time for it havoc only would have\r\nresulted[632].\" The wrong time for Southern pressure on Russell was\r\nconceived by Seward to be the right time for the North. Immediately\r\nfollowing the capture of New Orleans he gave positive instructions to\r\nDayton in Paris and Adams in London to propose the withdrawal of the\r\ndeclaration admitting Southern belligerent rights. Thouvenel replied\r\nwith some asperity on the folly of Seward's demand, and made a strong\r\nrepresentation of the necessity of France to obtain cotton and\r\ntobacco[633]. Adams, with evident reluctance, writing, \"I had little\r\nexpectation of success, but I felt it my duty at once to execute the\r\norders,\" advanced with Russell the now threadbare and customary\r\narguments on the Proclamation of Neutrality, and received the usual\r\nrefusal to alter British policy[634]. If Seward was sincere in asking\r\nfor a retraction of belligerent rights to the South he much mistook\r\nEuropean attitude; if he was but making use of Northern victories to\r\nreturn to a high tone of warning to Europe--a tone serviceable in\r\ncausing foreign governments to step warily--his time was well chosen.\r\nCertainly at Washington Lyons did not regard very seriously Seward's\r\nrenewal of demand on belligerency. Satisfied that there was no immediate\r\nreason to require his presence in America, ill and fearing the heat of\r\nsummer, he had asked on May 9 for permission to take leave of absence\r\nfor a trip home. On June 6 he received this permission, evidence that\r\nRussell also saw no cause for anxiety, and on June 13 he took leave\r\nof Lincoln.\r\n\r\n     \"I had quite an affectionate parting with the President this\r\n     morning. He told me, as is his wont, a number of stories more\r\n     or less decorous, but all he said having any bearing on\r\n     political matters was: 'I suppose my position makes people in\r\n     England think a great deal more of me than I deserve, pray\r\n     tell 'em I mean 'em no harm[635].'\"\r\n\r\nFully a month had now elapsed in London since the arrival of news on any\r\nstriking military event in America. New Orleans was an old story, and\r\nwhile in general it was believed that Richmond must fall before\r\nMcClellan's army, the persistence of Southern fervid declarations that\r\nthey would never submit gave renewed courage to their British friends.\r\nLindsay was now of the opinion that it might be wise, after all, to make\r\nsome effort in Parliament, and since the Washington mediation rumours\r\nwere becoming current in London also, notice was given of a motion\r\ndemanding of the Government that, associating itself with France, an\r\noffer of mediation be made to the contending parties in America.\r\nMotions on recognition and on the blockade had been tried and had\r\nfailed. Now the cry was to be \"peaceful mediation\" to put an end to a\r\nterrible war. Friends of the South were not united in this adventure.\r\nSpence advised Lindsay to postpone it, but the latter seemed determined\r\nto make the effort[636]. Probably he was still smarting under his\r\nreverse of April. Possibly also he was aware of a sudden sharp personal\r\nclash between Palmerston and Adams that might not be without influence\r\non governmental attitude--perhaps might even indicate a governmental\r\npurpose to alter its policy.\r\n\r\nThis clash was caused by a personal letter written by Palmerston to\r\nAdams on the publication in the _Times_ of General Butler's famous order\r\nin New Orleans authorizing Federal soldiers to treat as \"women of the\r\ntown\" those women who publicly insulted Northern troops. The British\r\npress indulged in an ecstasy of vicious writing about this order similar\r\nto that on the Northern \"barbarity\" of the Stone Fleet episode.\r\nPalmerston's letters to Adams and the replies received need no further\r\nnotice here, since they did not in fact affect British policy, than to\r\nexplain that Palmerston wrote in extreme anger, apparently, and with\r\ngreat violence of language, and that Adams replied with equal anger, but\r\nin very dignified if irritating terms[637]. In British opinion Butler's\r\norder was an incitement to his soldiers to commit atrocities; Americans\r\nunderstood it as merely an authorization to return insult for insult. In\r\nfact the order promptly put a stop to attacks on Northern soldiers,\r\nwhether by act or word, and all disorder ceased. Palmerston was quick to\r\naccept the British view, writing to Adams, \"it is difficult if not\r\nimpossible to express adequately the disgust which must be excited in\r\nthe mind of every honourable man by the general order of General\r\nButler....\" \"If the Federal government chooses to be served by men\r\ncapable of such revolting outrages, they must submit to abide by the\r\ndeserved opinion which mankind will form of their conduct[638].\" This\r\nextraordinary letter was written on June 11. Adams was both angry and\r\nperturbed, since he thought the letter might indicate an intention to\r\nchange British policy and that Palmerston was but laying the ground for\r\nsome \"vigorous\" utterance in Parliament, after his wont when striking\r\nout on a new line. He was further confirmed in this view by an editorial\r\nin the _Times_ on June 12, hinting at a coming mediation, and by news\r\nfrom France that Persigny was on his way to London to arrange such a\r\nstep. But however much personally aggrieved, Adams was cool as a\r\ndiplomat. His first step was to write a brief note to Palmerston\r\nenquiring whether he was to consider the letter as addressed to him\r\n\"officially ... or purely as a private expression of sentiment between\r\ngentlemen[639].\"\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Palmerston and Russell were contemplating a\r\nchange of policy--rather the reverse. But it does appear that Palmerston\r\nwished to be able to state in Parliament that he had taken Adams to task\r\nfor Butler's order, so that he might meet an enquiry already placed on\r\nthe question paper as to the Ministry's intentions in the matter. This\r\nquestion was due for the sitting of June 13, and on that day Russell\r\nwrote to Palmerston that he should call Butler's order \"brutal\" and that\r\nPalmerston might use the term \"infamous\" if preferred, adding, \"I do not\r\nsee why we should not represent in a friendly way that the usages of war\r\ndo not sanction such conduct[640].\" This was very different from the\r\ntone used by Palmerston. His letter was certainly no \"friendly way.\"\r\nAgain on the same day Russell wrote to Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"Adams has been here in a dreadful state about the letter you\r\n     have written him about Butler.\r\n\r\n     I declined to give him any opinion and asked him to do\r\n     nothing more till I had seen or written to you.\r\n\r\n     What you say of Butler is true enough, tho' he denies your\r\n     interpretation of the order.\r\n\r\n     But it is not clear that the President approves of the order,\r\n     and I think if you could add something to the effect that you\r\n     respect the Government of President Lincoln, and do not wish\r\n     to impute to them the fault of Butler it might soothe him.\r\n\r\n     If you could withdraw the letter altogether it would be the\r\n     best. But this you may not like to do[641].\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that Russell did not approve of Palmerston's move against\r\nAdams nor of any \"vigorous\" language in Parliament, and as to the last,\r\nhe had his way, for the Government, while disapproving Butler's order,\r\nwas decidedly mild in comment. As to the letter, Adams, the suspicion\r\nproving unfounded that an immediate change of policy was intended,\r\nreturned to the attack as a matter of personal prestige. It was not\r\nuntil June 15 that Palmerston replied to Adams and then in far different\r\nlanguage seeking to smooth the Minister's ruffled feathers, yet making\r\nno apology and not answering Adams' question. Adams promptly responded\r\nwith vigour, June 16, again asking his question as to the letter being\r\nofficial or personal, and characterizing Palmerston's previous\r\nassertions as \"offensive imputations.\" He also again approached Russell,\r\nwho stated that he too had written to Palmerston about his letter, but\r\nhad received no reply, and he acknowledged that Palmerston's proceeding\r\nwas \"altogether irregular[642].\" In the end Palmerston was brought, June\r\n19, to write a long and somewhat rambling reply to Adams, in effect\r\nstill evading the question put him, though acknowledging that the\r\n\"Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is the regular official organ\r\nfor communications....\" In conclusion he expressed gratification that\r\nreports from Lord Lyons showed Butler's authority at New Orleans had\r\nbeen curtailed by Lincoln. The next day Adams answered interpreting\r\nPalmerston as withdrawing his \"imputations\" but stating plainly that he\r\nwould not again submit \"to entertain any similar correspondence[643].\"\r\n\r\nAdams had been cautious in pushing for an answer until he knew there was\r\nto be no change in British policy. Indeed Palmerston's whole move may\r\neven have been intended to ease the pressure for a change in that\r\npolicy. On the very day of Adams' first talk with Russell, friends of\r\nthe South thought the _Times_ editorial indicated \"that some movement is\r\nto be made at last, and I doubt not we are to thank the Emperor for\r\nit[644].\" But on this day also Russell was advising Palmerston to state\r\nin Parliament that \"We have not received at present any proposal from\r\nFrance to offer mediation and no intention at present exists to offer it\r\non our part[645].\" This was the exact language used by Palmerston in\r\nreply to Hopwood[646]. Mason again saw his hopes dwindling, but was\r\nassured by Lindsay that all was not yet lost, and that he would \"still\r\nhold his motion under consideration[647].\" Lindsay, according to his own\r\naccount, had talked very large in a letter to Russell, but knew\r\nprivately, and so informed Mason, that the Commons would not vote for\r\nhis motion if opposed by the Government, and so intended to postpone\r\nit[648]. The proposed motion was now one for recognition instead of\r\nmediation, a temporary change of plan due to Palmerston's answer to\r\nHopwood on June 13. But whatever the terms of the motion favourable to\r\nthe South, it was evident the Government did not wish discussion at the\r\nmoment, and hesitancy came over pro-Southern friends. Slidell, in\r\ndespair, declared that for his part he intended, no matter with what\r\nprospect of success, to _demand_ recognition from France[649]. This\r\nalarmed Mason's English advisers, and he wrote at once strongly urging\r\nagainst such a step, for if the demand were presented and refused there\r\nwould be no recourse but to depart for home[650]. He thought Lindsay's\r\nmotion dying away for on consultation with \"different parties, including\r\nDisraeli, Seymour Fitzgerald and Roebuck,\" it \"has been so far reduced\r\nand diluted ... as to make it only expressive of the opinion of the\r\nHouse that the present posture of affairs in America made the question\r\nof the recognition of the Confederate States worth the serious\r\nconsideration of the Government. It was so modified to prevent the\r\nMinistry making an issue upon it....\" There was \"no assurance that it\r\nwould be sustained ... even in that form.\" Lindsay had determined to\r\npostpone his motion \"for a fortnight, so that all expectation from this\r\nquarter for the present is dished, and we must wait for 'King Cotton' to\r\nturn the screw still further[651].\" On June, 20 Lindsay gave this notice\r\nof postponement, and no parliamentary comment was made[652]. It was a\r\nmoment of extreme depression for the Confederate agents in Europe.\r\nSlidell, yielding to Mason's pleas, gave up his idea of demanding\r\nrecognition and wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The position of our representatives in Europe is painful and\r\n     almost humiliating; it might be tolerated if they could be\r\n     consoled by the reflection that their presence was in any way\r\n     advantageous to their cause but I am disposed to believe that\r\n     we would have done better to withdraw after our first\r\n     interview with Russell and Thouvenel[653].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR GOLDWIN SMITH (_From a photograph by Elliott &\r\nFry, Ltd._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: _U.S. Messages and Documents, 1862-63_, Pt.

I have\r\n     told him that I have postponed my motion in courtesy to\r\n     him--that the sympathy of nine-tenths of the members of the\r\n     House was in favour of immediate recognition, and that even\r\n     if the Government was not prepared to accept my motion, a\r\n     majority of votes might have been obtained in its\r\n     favour--that a majority of votes _would_ be obtained within\r\n     the next fortnight, and I expressed the most earnest hope\r\n     that the Government would move (as the country, and France,\r\n     are most anxious for them to do so) and thus prevent the\r\n     necessity of any private member undertaking a duty which\r\n     belonged to the Executive.\r\n\r\n     \"I further told his Lordship that recognition was a _right_\r\n     which no one would deny us the form of exercising, that the\r\n     fear of war if we exercised it was a delusion.

I further said, that if the question is settled\r\n     _without_ our recognition of the South, he might _rest\r\n     certain_ that the Northern Armies _would_ be marched into\r\n     Canada.

Earlier Northern victories were forgotten and the campaigns in\r\nthe West, still progressing favourably for the North, were ignored or\r\ntheir significance not understood. Again, to English eyes, the war in\r\nAmerica approached a stalemate. The time had come with the near\r\nadjournment of Parliament when, if ever, a strong Southern effort must\r\nbe made, and the time seemed propitious. Moreover by July, 1862, it was\r\nhoped that soon, in the cotton districts, the depression steadily\r\nincreasing since the beginning of the war, would bring an ally to the\r\nSouthern cause. Before continuing the story of Parliamentary and private\r\nefforts by the friends of the South it is here necessary to review the\r\ncotton situation--now rapidly becoming a matter of anxious concern to\r\nboth friend and foe of the North and in less degree to the\r\nMinistry itself.\r\n\r\n\"King Cotton\" had long been a boast with the South. \"Perhaps no great\r\nrevolution,\" says Bancroft, \"was ever begun with such convenient and\r\nsoothing theories as those that were expounded and believed at the time\r\nof the organization of the Confederacy.... In any case, hostilities\r\ncould not last long, for France and Great Britain must have what the\r\nConfederacy alone could supply, and therefore they could be forced to\r\naid the South, as a condition precedent to relief from the terrible\r\ndistress that was sure to follow a blockade[654].\" This confidence was\r\nno new development. For ten years past whenever Southern threats of\r\nsecession had been indulged in, the writers and politicians of that\r\nsection had expanded upon cotton as the one great wealth-producing\r\nindustry of America and as the one product which would compel European\r\nacquiescence in American policy, whether of the Union, before 1860, or\r\nof the South if she should secede. In the financial depression that\r\nswept the Northern States in 1857 _De Bow's Review_, the leading\r\nfinancial journal of the South, declared: \"The wealth of the South is\r\npermanent and real, that of the North fugitive and fictitious. Events\r\nnow transpiring expose the fiction, as humbug after humbug\r\nexplodes[655].\" On March 4, 1858, Senator Hammond of South Carolina,\r\nasked in a speech, \"What would happen if no cotton was furnished for\r\nthree years? I will not stop to depict what everyone can imagine, but\r\nthis is certain: England would topple headlong and carry the whole\r\ncivilized world with her save the South. No, you dare not make war on\r\ncotton. No power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton _is_\r\nKing[656].\" Two years later, writing before the elections of 1860 in\r\nwhich the main question was that of the territorial expansion of\r\nslavery, this same Southern statesman expressed himself as believing\r\nthat \"the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the\r\nworld.... Cotton, rice, tobacco and naval stores command the world; and\r\nwe have sense enough to know it, and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry\r\nit out successfully[657].\"\r\n\r\nThese quotations indicative of Southern faith in cotton might be\r\namplified and repeated from a hundred sources.\r\n\r\nMoreover this faith in the possession of ultimate power went hand in\r\nhand with the conviction that the South, more than any other quarter of\r\nthe world, produced to the benefit of mankind. \"In the three million\r\nbags of cotton,\" said a writer in _De Bow's Review_, \"the slave-labour\r\nannually throws upon the world for the poor and naked, we are doing more\r\nto advance civilization ... than all the canting philanthropists of New\r\nEngland and Old England will do in centuries. Slavery is the backbone of\r\nthe Northern commercial as it is of the British manufacturing\r\nsystem[658]....\" Nor was this idea unfamiliar to Englishmen. Before the\r\nCivil War was under way Charles Greville wrote to Clarendon:\r\n\r\n     \"Any war will be almost sure to interfere with the cotton\r\n     crops, and this is really what affects us and what we care\r\n     about. With all our virulent abuse of slavery and\r\n     slave-owners, and our continual self-laudation on that\r\n     subject, we are just as anxious for, and as much interested\r\n     in, the prosperity of the slavery interest in the Southern\r\n     States as the Carolinan and Georgian planters themselves, and\r\n     all Lancashire would deplore a successful insurrection of the\r\n     slaves, if such a thing were possible[659].\"\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 1860, South Carolina led the march in secession.\r\nFifteen days earlier the British consul at Charleston, Bunch, reported a\r\nconversation with Rhett, long a leader of the Southern cause and now a\r\nconsistent advocate of secession, in which Rhett developed a plan of\r\nclose commercial alliance with England as the most favoured nation,\r\npostulating the dependence of Great Britain on the South for\r\ncotton--\"upon which supposed axiom, I would remark,\" wrote Bunch, \"all\r\ntheir calculations are based[660].\" Such was, indeed, Southern\r\ncalculation. In January, 1861, _De Bow's Review_ contained an article\r\ndeclaring that \"the first demonstration of blockade of the Southern\r\nports would be swept away by the English fleets of observation hovering\r\non the Southern coasts, to protect English commerce, and especially the\r\nfree flow of cotton to English and French factories.... A stoppage of\r\nthe raw material ... would produce the most disastrous political\r\nresults--if not a revolution in England. This is the language of English\r\nstatesmen, manufacturers, and merchants, in Parliament and at cotton\r\nassociations' debates, and it discloses the truth[661].\"\r\n\r\nThe historical student will find but few such British utterances at the\r\nmoment, and these few not by men of great weight either in politics or\r\nin commerce. The South was labouring under an obsession and prophesied\r\nresults accordingly. So strong was this obsession that governmental\r\nforeign policy neglected all other considerations and the first\r\nCommission to Europe had no initial instructions save to demand\r\nrecognition[662]. The failure of that Commission, the prompt British\r\nacquiescence in the blockade, were harsh blows to Southern confidence\r\nbut did not for a long time destroy the faith in the power of cotton. In\r\nJune, 1861, Bunch wrote that there was still a firm belief that \"Great\r\nBritain will make any sacrifice, even of principle or of honour, to\r\nprevent the stoppage of the supply of cotton,\" and he enclosed a copy of\r\nan article in the _Charleston Mercury_ of June 4, proclaiming: \"The\r\ncards are in our hands, and we intend to play them out to _the\r\nbankruptcy of every cotton factory in Great Britain and France, or the\r\nacknowledgment of our independence_[663].\" As late as March, 1862, Bunch\r\nwas still writing of this Southern faith in cotton and described the\r\nnewly-made appointment of Benjamin as Secretary of State as partly due\r\nto the fact that he was the leader of the \"King Cotton\" theory of\r\ndiplomacy[664]. It was not until the war was well nigh over that British\r\npersistence in neutrality, in spite of undoubted hardships caused by the\r\nlack of cotton, opened Southern eyes. Pollard, editor of a leading\r\nRichmond newspaper, and soon unfriendly to the administration of\r\nJefferson Davis, summed up in _The Lost Cause_ his earlier criticisms of\r\nConfederate foreign policy:\r\n\r\n     \"'Cotton,' said the Charleston _Mercury_, 'would bring\r\n     England to her knees.' The idea was ludicrous enough that\r\n     England and France would instinctively or readily fling\r\n     themselves into a convulsion, which their great politicians\r\n     saw was the most tremendous one of modern times. But the\r\n     puerile argument, which even President Davis did not hesitate\r\n     to adopt, about the power of 'King Cotton,' amounted to this\r\n     absurdity: that the great and illustrious power of England\r\n     would submit to the ineffable humiliation of acknowledging\r\n     its dependency on the infant Confederacy of the South, and\r\n     the subserviency of its empire, its political interests and\r\n     its pride, to a single article of trade that was grown in\r\n     America[665]!\"\r\n\r\nBut irrespective of the extremes to which Southern confidence in cotton\r\nextended the actual hardships of England were in all truth serious\r\nenough to cause grave anxiety and to supply an argument to Southern\r\nsympathizers. The facts of the \"Lancashire Cotton Famine\" have\r\nfrequently been treated by historians at much length[666] and need here\r\nbut a general review. More needed is an examination of some of the\r\nerroneous deductions drawn from the facts and especially an examination\r\nof the extent to which the question of cotton supply affected or\r\ndetermined British governmental policy toward America.\r\n\r\nEnglish cotton manufacturing in 1861 held a position of importance\r\nequalled by no other one industry. Estimates based on varying statistics\r\ndiverge as to exact proportions, but all agree in emphasizing the\r\npre-eminent place of Lancashire in determining the general prosperity of\r\nthe nation. Surveying the English, not the whole British, situation it\r\nis estimated that there were 2,650 factories of which 2,195 were in\r\nLancashire and two adjacent counties. These employed 500,000 operatives\r\nand consumed a thousand million pounds of cotton each year[667]. An\r\neditorial in the _Times_, September 19, 1861, stated that one-fifth of\r\nthe entire English population was held to be dependent, either directly\r\nor indirectly, on the prosperity of the cotton districts[668], and\r\ntherefore also dependent on the source of supply, the Confederate South,\r\nsince statistics, though varying, showed that the raw cotton supplied\r\nfrom America constituted anywhere from 78 to 84 per cent. of the total\r\nEnglish importation[669].\r\n\r\nThe American crop of 1860 was the largest on record, nearly 4,000,000\r\nbales, and the foreign shipments, without question hurried because of\r\nthe storm-cloud rising at home, had been practically completed by April,\r\n1861. Of the 3,500,000 bales sent abroad, Liverpool, as usual, received\r\nthe larger portion[670]. There was, then, no immediate shortage of\r\nsupply when war came in America, rather an unusual accumulation of raw\r\nstocks, even permitting some reshipment to the Northern manufacturing\r\ncentres of America where the scarcity then brought high prices. In\r\naddition, from December, 1860, to at least April, 1861, there had been\r\nsomewhat of a slump in demand for raw cotton by British manufacturers\r\ndue to an over-production of goods in the two previous years. There had\r\nbeen a temporary depression in 1856-57 caused by a general financial\r\ncrisis, but early in 1858 restored confidence and a tremendous demand\r\nfrom the Far East--India especially--set the mills running again on full\r\ntime, while many new mills were brought into operation. But by May,\r\n1860, the mills had caught up with the heavy demands and the rest of the\r\nyear saw uncertainty of operations and brought expressions of fear that\r\nthe \"plunge\" to produce had been overdone. Manufactured stocks began to\r\naccumulate, and money was not easy since 1860 brought also a combination\r\nof events--deficient grain harvest at home, withdrawal of gold from\r\nEngland to France for investment in French public works, demand of\r\nAmerica for gold in place of goods, due to political uncertainties\r\nthere--which rapidly raised the discount rate from two and one half per\r\ncent. in January, 1860, to six in December. By the end of April, 1861,\r\nthe Board of Trade Returns indicated that the cotton trade was in a\r\ndangerous situation, with large imports of raw cotton and decreased\r\nexports of goods[671]. The news of war actually begun in America came as\r\na temporary relief to the English cotton trade and in the prospect of\r\ndecreased supply prices rose, saving many manufacturers from impending\r\ndifficulties. A few mills had already begun to work on part-time because\r\nof trade depression. The _immediate_ effect of Lincoln's blockade\r\nproclamation was to check this movement, but by October it had again\r\nbegun and this time because of the rapid increase in the price of raw\r\ncotton as compared with the slower advance of the price of goods[672].\r\n\r\nIn substance the principal effect of the War on the English cotton trade\r\nfor the first seven or eight months was felt, not in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts but in the Liverpool speculative and importing markets of raw\r\ncotton. Prices rose steadily to over a shilling a pound in October,\r\n1861. On November 23 there was a near panic caused by rumours of British\r\nintervention. These were denounced as false and in five days the price\r\nwas back above its previous figure. Then on November 27 came the news\r\nof the _Trent_ and the market was thrown into confusion, not because of\r\nhopes that cotton would come more freely but in fear that war with\r\nAmerica would cause it to do so. The Liverpool speculators breathed\r\nfreely again only when peace was assured. This speculative British\r\ninterest was no cause for serious governmental concern and could not\r\naffect policy. But the manufacturing trade was, presumably, a more\r\nserious anxiety and if cotton became hard, or even impossible to obtain,\r\na serious situation would demand consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the generally accepted view of a \"short war,\" there was at first no\r\ngreat anticipation of real danger. But beginning with December, 1861,\r\nthere was almost complete stoppage of supply from America. In the six\r\nmonths to the end of May, 1862, but 11,500 bales were received, less\r\nthan one per cent. of the amount for the same six months of the previous\r\nyear[673]. The blockade was making itself felt and not merely in\r\nshipments from the South but in prospects of Southern production, for\r\nthe news came that the negroes were being withdrawn by their masters\r\nfrom the rich sea islands along the coast in fear of their capture by\r\nthe Northern blockading squadrons[674]. Such a situation seemed bound in\r\nthe end to result in pressure by the manufacturers for governmental\r\naction to secure cotton. That it did not immediately do so is explained\r\nby Arnold, whose dictum has been quite generally accepted, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The immediate result of the American war was, at this time,\r\n     to relieve the English cotton trade, including the dealers in\r\n     the raw material and the producers and dealers in\r\n     manufactures, from a serious and impending difficulty. They\r\n     had in hand a stock of goods sufficient for the consumption\r\n     of two-thirds of a year, therefore a rise in the price of the\r\n     raw material and the partial closing of their establishments,\r\n     with a curtailment of their working expenses, was obviously\r\n     to their advantage. But to make their success complete, this\r\n     rise in the price of cotton was upon the largest stock ever\r\n     collected in the country at this season. To the cotton trade\r\n     there came in these days an unlooked for accession of wealth,\r\n     such as even it had never known before. In place of the hard\r\n     times which had been anticipated, and perhaps deserved, there\r\n     came a shower of riches[675].\"\r\n\r\nThis was written of the situation in December, 1861. A similar analysis,\r\nno doubt on the explanations offered by his English friends, of \"the\r\nquestion of cotton supply, which we had supposed would speedily have\r\ndisturbed the level of their neutral policy\" was made by Mason in March,\r\n1862. \"Thus,\" he concluded, \"it is that even in Lancashire and other\r\nmanufacturing districts no open demonstration has been made against the\r\nblockade[676].\" Manufactures other than cotton were greatly prospering,\r\nin particular those of woollen, flax, and iron. And the theory that the\r\ncotton lords were not, in reality, hit by the blockade--perhaps profited\r\nby it--was bruited even during the war. _Blackwood's Magazine_, October,\r\n1864, held this view, while the _Morning Post_ of May 16, 1864, went to\r\nthe extent of describing the \"glut\" of goods in 1861, relieved just in\r\nthe nick of time by the War, preventing a financial crash, \"which must\r\nsooner or later have caused great suffering in Lancashire.\"\r\n\r\nArnold's generalization has been taken to prove that the _immediate_\r\neffect of the Civil War was to save the cotton industry from great\r\ndisaster and that there _immediately_ resulted large profits to the\r\nmanufacturers from the increased price of stocks on hand. In fact his\r\ndescription of the situation in December, 1861, as his own later pages\r\nshow, was not applicable, so far as manufacturers' profits are\r\nconcerned, until the later months of 1862 and the first of 1863. For\r\nthough prices might be put up, as they were, goods were not sold in any\r\nlarge quantities before the fall of 1862. There were almost no\r\ntransactions for shipments to America, China, or the Indies[677].\r\nForeign purchasers as always, and especially when their needs had just\r\nbeen abundantly supplied by the great output of 1858-60, were not keen\r\nto place new orders in a rising and uncertain market. The English\r\nproducers raised their prices, but they held their goods, lacking an\r\neffective market. The importance of this in British foreign policy is\r\nthat at no time, until the accumulated goods were disposed of, was there\r\nlikely to be any trade eagerness for a British intervention in America.\r\nTheir only fear, says Arnold, was the sudden opening of Southern ports\r\nand a rush of raw cotton[678], a sneer called out by the alleged great\r\nlosses incurred and patriotically borne in silence. Certainly in\r\nParliament the members from Lancashire gave no sign of discontent with\r\nthe Government policy of neutrality for in the various debates on\r\nblockade, mediation, and cotton supply but one Member from Lancashire,\r\nHopwood, ever spoke in favour of a departure from neutrality, or\r\nreferred to the distress in the manufacturing districts as due to any\r\nother cause than the shortage in cotton caused by the war[679].\r\n\r\nBut it was far otherwise with the operatives of Lancashire. Whatever the\r\ncauses of short-time operation in the mills or of total cessation of\r\nwork the situation was such that from October, 1861, more and more\r\noperatives were thrown out of employment. As their little savings\r\ndisappeared they were put upon public poor relief or upon private\r\ncharity for subsistence. The governmental statistics do not cover,\r\naccurately, the relief offered by private charity, but those of public\r\naid well indicate the loss of wage-earning opportunity. In the so-called\r\n\"Distressed Districts\" of Lancashire and the adjoining counties it\r\nappears that poor relief was given to 48,000 persons in normal times,\r\nout of a total population of 2,300,000. In the first week of November,\r\n1861, it was 61,207, and for the first week of December, 71,593;\r\nthereafter mounting steadily until March, 1862, when a temporary peak of\r\n113,000 was reached. From March until the first week in June there was a\r\nslight decrease; but from the second week of June poor relief resumed an\r\nupward trend, increasing rapidly until December, 1862, when it reached\r\nits highest point of 284,418. In this same first week of December\r\nprivate relief, now thoroughly organized in a great national effort, was\r\nextended to 236,000 people, making a grand total at high tide of\r\ndistress of over 550,000 persons, if private relief was not extended to\r\nthose receiving public funds. But of this differentiation there is no\r\nsurety--indeed there are evidences of much duplication of effort in\r\ncertain districts. In general, however, these statistics do exhibit the\r\ngreat lack of employment in a one-industry district heretofore enjoying\r\nunusual prosperity[680].\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing operative population of the district was estimated at\r\nbetween 500,000 and 600,000. At the time of greatest distress some\r\n412,000 of these were receiving either public or private aid, though\r\nmany were working part-time in the mills or were engaged on public\r\nenterprises set on foot to ease the crisis. But there was no starvation\r\nand it is absurd to compare the crisis to the Irish famine of the\r\n'forties. This was a _cotton_ famine in the shortage of that commodity,\r\nbut it was not a _human_ famine. The country, wrote John Bright, was\r\npassing through a terrible crisis, but \"our people will be kept alive by\r\nthe contributions of the country[681].\" Nevertheless a rapid change from\r\na condition of adequate wage-earning to one of dependence on charity--a\r\nchange ultimately felt by the great bulk of those either directly or\r\nindirectly dependent upon the cotton industry--might have been expected\r\nto arouse popular demonstrations to force governmental action directed\r\nto securing cotton that trade might revive. That no such popular effect\r\nwas made demands careful analysis--to be offered in a later chapter--but\r\nhere the _fact_ is alone important, and the fact was that the operatives\r\nsympathized with the North and put no pressure on the Cabinet. Thus at\r\nno time during the war was there any attempt from Lancashire, whether of\r\nmanufacturers or operatives, to force a change of governmental\r\npolicy[682].\r\n\r\nAs the lack of employment developed in Lancashire public discussion and\r\nconsideration were inevitably aroused. But there was little talk of\r\ngovernmental interference and such as did appear was promptly met with\r\nopposition by the leading trade journals. July 13, 1861, the _Economist_\r\nviewed the cotton shortage as \"a _temporary_ and an _immediate_ one....\r\nWe have--on our hypothesis--to provide against the stoppage of our\r\nsupply for _one_ year, and that the very _next_ year.\" Would it _pay_,\r\nasked Bright, to break the blockade? \"I don't think myself it would be\r\ncheap ... at the cost of a war with the United States[683].\" This was\r\nalso the notion of the London _Shipping Gazette_ which, while\r\nacknowledging that the mill-owners of England and France were about to\r\nbe greatly embarrassed, continued: \"_But we are not going to add to the\r\ndifficulty by involving ourselves in a naval war with the Northern\r\nStates_[684]....\" The _Times_ commented in substance in several issues\r\nin September, 1861, on the \"wise policy of working short-time as a\r\nprecaution against the contingencies of the cotton supply, and of the\r\nglutted state of distant markets for manufactured goods[685].\" October\r\n12, the _Economist_ acknowledged that the impatience of some mill-owners\r\nwas quite understandable as was talk of a European compulsion on America\r\nto stop an \"objectless and hopeless\" quarrel, but then entered upon an\r\nelaborate discussion of the principles involved and demonstrated why\r\nEngland ought not to intervene. In November Bright could write: \"The\r\nnotion of getting cotton by interfering with the blockade is abandoned\r\napparently by the simpletons who once entertained it, and it is accepted\r\nnow as a fixed policy that we are to take no part in your\r\ndifficulties[686].\" Throughout the fall of 1861 the _Economist_ was\r\ndoing its best to quiet apprehensions, urging that due to the \"glut\" of\r\nmanufactured goods short-time must have ensued anyway, pointing out that\r\nnow an advanced price was possible, and arguing that here was a\r\nsituation likely to result in the development of other sources of supply\r\nwith an escape from the former dependence on America. In view of the\r\nactual conditions of the trade, already recounted, these were appealing\r\narguments to the larger manufacturers, but the small mills, running on\r\nshort order supplies and with few stocks of goods on hand were less\r\neasily convinced. They were, however, without parliamentary influence\r\nand hence negligible as affecting public policy. At the opening of the\r\nnew year, 1862, Bright declared that \"with the spinners and\r\nmanufacturers and merchants, I think generally there is no wish for any\r\n_immediate_ change[687].\"\r\n\r\nBright's letter of November, 1861, was written before news of the\r\n_Trent_ reached England: that of January, 1862, just after that\r\ncontroversy had been amicably settled. The _Trent_ had both diverted\r\nattention from cotton and in its immediate result created a general\r\ndetermination to preserve neutrality. It is evident that even without\r\nthis threat of war there was no real cotton pressure upon the\r\nGovernment. With Northern successes in the spring of 1862 hopes were\r\naroused that the war would soon end or that at least some cotton\r\ndistricts would be captured to the relief of England. Seward held out\r\nbig promises based on the capture of New Orleans, and these for a time\r\ncalmed governmental apprehensions, though by midsummer it was clear that\r\nthe inability to secure the country back of the city, together with the\r\nSouthern determination to burn their cotton rather than see it fall into\r\nthe hands of the enemy, would prevent any great supply from the\r\nMississippi valley[688]. This was still not a matter of _immediate_\r\nconcern, for the Government and the manufacturers both held the opinion\r\nthat it was not lack of cotton alone that was responsible for the\r\ndistress and the manufacturers were just beginning to unload their\r\nstocks[689]. But in considering and judging the attitude of the British\r\npublic on this question of cotton it should always be remembered that\r\nthe great mass of the people sincerely believed that America was\r\nresponsible for the distress in Lancashire. The error in understanding\r\nwas more important than the truth.\r\n\r\nIn judging governmental policy, however, the truth as regards the causes\r\nof distress in England is the more important element. The \"Cotton Lords\"\r\ndid not choose to reveal it. One must believe that they intentionally\r\ndwelt upon the war as the sole responsible cause. In the first important\r\nparliamentary debate on cotton, May 9, 1862, not a word was said of any\r\nother element in the situation, and, it is to be noted, not a word\r\nadvocating a change in British neutral policy[690]. It is to be noted\r\nalso that this debate occurred when for two months past, the numbers on\r\npoor relief in Lancashire were temporarily decreasing[691], and the\r\ngeneral tone of the speakers was that while the distress was serious it\r\nwas not beyond the power of the local communities to meet it. There was\r\nnot, then, in May, any reason for grave concern and Russell expressed\r\ngovernmental conviction when he wrote to Gladstone, May 18, \"We must, I\r\nbelieve, get thro' the cotton crisis as we can, and promote inland works\r\nand railroads in India[692].\" Moreover the Southern orders to destroy\r\ncotton rather than permit its capture and export by the North\r\ndisagreeably affected British officials[693]. Up to the end of August,\r\n1862, Russell, while writing much to Lyons on England's necessity for\r\ncotton, did not do so in a vein indicative of criticism of Northern\r\npolicy nor in the sense that British distress demanded special official\r\nconsideration. Such demands on America as were made up to this time came\r\nwholly from France[694].\r\n\r\nIt was not then cotton, primarily, which brought a revival in July of\r\nthe Southern attack on the Government through Parliament[695]. June had\r\nseen the collapse of Lindsay's initial move, and Palmerston's answer to\r\nHopwood, June 13, that there was no intention, at present, to offer\r\nmediation, appeared final. It was not cotton, but McClellan's defeat,\r\nthat produced a quick renewal of Lindsay's activities. June 30, Hopwood\r\nhad withdrawn his motion favouring recognition but in doing so asked\r\nwhether, \"considering the great and increasing distress in the country,\r\nthe patient manner in which it has hitherto been borne, and the\r\nhopelessness of the termination of hostilities, the Government intend to\r\ntake any steps whatever, either as parties to intervention or otherwise,\r\nto endeavour to put an end to the Civil War in America?\" This was\r\ndifferently worded, yet contained little variation from his former\r\nquestion of June 13, and this time Palmerston replied briefly that the\r\nGovernment certainly would like to mediate if it saw any hope of success\r\nbut that at present \"both parties would probably reject it. If a\r\ndifferent situation should arise the Government would be glad to\r\nact[696].\" This admission was now seized upon by Lindsay who, on July\r\n11, introduced a motion demanding consideration of \"the propriety of\r\noffering mediation with the view of terminating hostilities,\" and\r\ninsisted upon a debate.\r\n\r\nThus while the first week of June seemed to have quieted rumours of\r\nBritish mediation, the end of the month saw them revived. Adams was\r\nkeenly aware of the changing temper of opinion and on June 20 presented\r\nto Russell a strong representation by Seward who wrote \"under the\r\nPresident's instructions\" that such recurrent rumours were highly\r\ninjurious to the North since upon hopes of foreign aid the South has\r\nbeen encouraged and sustained from the first day of secession. Having\r\ndeveloped this complaint at some length Seward went on to a brief\r\nthreat, containing the real meat of the despatch, that if foreign\r\nnations did venture to intervene or mediate in favour of the South, the\r\nNorth would be forced to have recourse to a weapon hitherto not used,\r\nnamely to aid in a rising of the slaves against their masters. This was\r\nclearly a threat of a \"servile war\" if Great Britain aided the South--a\r\nwar which would place Britain in a very uncomfortable position in view\r\nof her anti-slavery sentiments in the past. It is evidence of Adams'\r\ndiscretion that this despatch, written May 28, was held back from\r\npresentation to Russell until revived rumours of mediation made the\r\nAmerican Minister anxious[697]. No answer was given by Russell for over\r\na month, a fact in itself indicative of some hesitancy on policy. Soon\r\nthe indirect diplomacy of Napoleon III was renewed in the hope of\r\nBritish concurrence. July 11, Slidell informed Mason that Persigny in\r\nconversation had assured him \"that this Government is now more anxious\r\nthan ever to take prompt and decided action in our favour.\" Slidell\r\nasked if it was impossible to stir Parliament but acknowledged that\r\neverything depended on Palmerston: \"that august body seems to be as\r\nafraid of him as the urchins of a village school of the birch of their\r\npedagogue[698].\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably Persigny here gave Slidell a hint of private instructions\r\nnow being sent by Napoleon to Thouvenel who was on a visit to London.\r\nThe Emperor telegraphed \"Demandez au gouvernement anglais s'il ne croit\r\npas le moment venu de reconnaître le Sud[699].\" Palmerston had already\r\nanswered this question in Parliament and Thouvenel was personally very\r\nmuch opposed to the Emperor's suggestion. There were press rumours that\r\nhe was in London to bring the matter to a head, but his report to\r\nMercier was that interference in America was a very dangerous matter and\r\nthat he would have been \"badly received\" by Palmerston and Russell if he\r\nhad suggested any change in neutral policy[700].\r\n\r\nIn spite of this decided opposition by the French Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs it is evident that one ground for renewed Southern hopes was the\r\nknowledge of the Emperor's private desires. Lindsay chose his time well\r\nfor on July 16 the first thorough report on Lancashire was laid before\r\nParliament[701], revealing an extremity of distress not previously\r\nofficially authenticated, and during this week the papers were full of\r\nan impending disaster to McClellan's army. Lyons, now in London, on his\r\nvacation trip, was concerned for the future mainly because of cotton,\r\nbut did not believe there was much danger of an immediate clash with\r\nAmerica[702]. But the great Southern argument of the moment was the\r\nNorthern military failure, the ability of the South to resist\r\nindefinitely and the hopelessness of the war. On the morning of July 18\r\nall London was in excitement over press statements that the latest news\r\nfrom America was not of McClellan's retreat but of the capture of his\r\nentire army.\r\n\r\nLindsay's motion was set for debate on this same July 18. Adams thought\r\nthe story of McClellan's surrender had been set afloat \"to carry the\r\nHouse of Commons off their feet in its debate to-night[703].\" The\r\ndebate itself may be regarded as a serious attempt to push the Ministry\r\ninto a position more favourable to the South, and the arguments advanced\r\nsurveyed the entire ground of the causes of secession and the\r\ninevitability of the final separation of North and South. They need but\r\nbrief summary. Lindsay, refusing to accede to appeals for postponement\r\nbecause \"the South was winning anyway,\" argued that slavery was no\r\nelement in the conflict, that the Southern cause was just, and that\r\nEngland, because of her own difficulties, should mediate and bring to a\r\nconclusion a hopeless war. He claimed the time was opportune since\r\nmediation would be welcomed by a great majority in the North, and he\r\nquoted from a letter by a labouring man in Lancashire, stating, \"We\r\nthink it high time to give the Southern States the recognition they so\r\nrichly deserve.\"\r\n\r\nOther pro-Southern speakers emphasized Lancashire distress. Gregory\r\nsaid: \"We should remember what is impending over Lancashire--what want,\r\nwhat woe, what humiliation--and that not caused by the decree of God,\r\nbut by the perversity of man. I leave the statistics of the pauperism\r\nthat is, and that is to be, to my honourable friends, the\r\nrepresentatives of manufacturing England.\" No statistics were\r\nforthcoming from this quarter for not a representative from Lancashire\r\nparticipated in the debate save Hopwood who at the very end upbraided\r\nhis fellow members from the district for their silence and was\r\ninterrupted by cries of \"Divide, Divide.\" Lindsay's quoted letter was\r\nmet by opponents of mediation with the assertion that the operatives\r\nwere well known to be united against any action and that they could be\r\nsustained \"in luxury\" from the public purse for far less a cost than\r\nthat of a war with America.\r\n\r\nBut cotton did not play the part expected of it in this debate. Forster\r\nin a very able speech cleverly keeping close to a consideration of the\r\neffect of mediation on _England_, advanced the idea that such a step\r\nwould not end the war but would merely intensify it and so prolong\r\nEnglish commercial distress. He did state, however, that intervention\r\n(as distinct from mediation) would bring on a \"servile war\" in America,\r\nthus giving evidence of his close touch with Adams and his knowledge of\r\nSeward's despatch of May 28. In the main the friends of the North were\r\ncontent to be silent and leave it to the Government to answer Lindsay.\r\nThis was good tactics and they were no doubt encouraged to silence by\r\nevidence early given in the debate that there would be no positive\r\nresult from the motion. Gregory showed that this was a real _attack_ on\r\nthe Government by his bitter criticisms of Russell's \"three months\"\r\nspeech[704].\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Gregory's speech Lindsay and his friends, their\r\nimmediate purpose accomplished and fearing a vote, wished to adjourn the\r\ndebate indefinitely. Palmerston objected. He agreed that everyone\r\nearnestly wished the war in America to end, but he declared that such\r\ndebates were a great mistake unless something definite was to follow\r\nsince they only served to create irritation in America, both North and\r\nSouth. He concluded with a vigorous assertion that if the Ministry were\r\nto administer the affairs of the nation it ought to be trusted in\r\nforeign affairs and not have its hands tied by parliamentary expressions\r\nof opinion at inopportune moments. Finally, the South had not yet\r\nsecurely established its independence and hence could not be recognized.\r\nThis motion, if carried, would place England on a definite side and thus\r\nbe fatal to any hope of successful mediation or intervention in the\r\nfuture. Having now made clear the policy of the Government Palmerston\r\ndid not insist upon a division and the motion was withdrawn[705].\r\n\r\nOn the surface Lindsay's effort of July 18 had resulted in ignominious\r\nfailure. Lyons called it \"ill-timed.... I do not think we know here\r\nsufficiently the extent of the disaster [to McClellan] to be able to\r\ncome to any conclusion as to what the European Powers should do.\" But\r\nthe impression left by the debate that there was a strong parliamentary\r\nopinion in favour of mediation made Lyons add: \"I suppose Mercier will\r\nopen full cry on the scent, and be all for mediation. I am still afraid\r\nof any attempt of the kind[706].\" Very much the same opinion was held by\r\nHenry Adams who wrote, \"the pinch has again passed by for the moment and\r\nwe breathe more freely. But I think I wrote to you some time ago that if\r\nJuly found us still in Virginia, we could no longer escape interference.\r\nI think now that it is inevitable.\" A definite stand taken by the North\r\non slavery would bring \"the greatest strength in this running\r\nbattle[707].\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of surface appearances that the debate was \"ill-timed\" the\r\n\"pinch\" was not in fact passed as the activities of Slidell and Mason\r\nand their friends soon indicated. For a fortnight the Cabinet, reacting\r\nto the repeated suggestions of Napoleon, the Northern defeats, and the\r\ndistress in Lancashire, was seriously considering the possibility of\r\ntaking some step toward mediation. On July 16, two days before the\r\ndebate in the Commons, Slidell at last had his first personal contact\r\nwith Napoleon, and came away from the interview with the conviction that\r\n\"if England long persists in her inaction he [Napoleon] would be\r\ndisposed to act without her.\" This was communicated to Mason on July\r\n20[708], but Slidell did _not_ as yet see fit to reveal to Mason that in\r\nthe interview with Napoleon he had made a definite push for separate\r\naction by France, offering inducements on cotton, a special commercial\r\ntreaty, and \"alliances, defensive, and offensive, for Mexican affairs,\"\r\nthis last without any authority from Benjamin, the Confederate Secretary\r\nof State. On July 23 Slidell made a similar offer to Thouvenel and left\r\nwith him a full memorandum of the Southern proposal[709]. He was\r\ncautioned that it was undesirable his special offer to France should\r\nreach the ears of the British Government--a caution which he transmitted\r\nto Mason on July 30, when sending copies of Benjamin's instructions, but\r\nstill without revealing the full extent of his own overtures\r\nto Napoleon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN SLIDELL (_From Nicolay and Hay's \"Life of Abraham\r\nLincoln\": The Century Co. New York_)]\r\n\r\nIn all this Slidell was still exhibiting that hankering to pull off a\r\nspecial diplomatic achievement, characteristic of the man, and in line,\r\nalso, with a persistent theory that the policy most likely to secure\r\nresults was that of inducing France to act alone. But he was repeatedly\r\nrunning against advice that France must follow Great Britain, and the\r\nburden of his July 20 letter to Mason was an urging that a demand for\r\nrecognition be now made simultaneously in Paris and London. Thouvenel,\r\nnot at all enthusiastic over Slidell's proposals, told him that this was\r\nat least a prerequisite, and on July 23, Slidell wrote Mason the demand\r\nshould be made at once[710]. Mason, on the advice of Lindsay,\r\nFitzgerald, and Lord Malmesbury, had already prepared a request for\r\nrecognition, but had deferred making it after listening to the debate of\r\nJuly 18[711]. Now, on July 24, he addressed Russell referring to their\r\ninterview of February, 1862, in which he had urged the claims of the\r\nConfederacy to recognition and again presented them, asserting that the\r\nsubsequent failure of Northern campaigns had demonstrated the power of\r\nthe South to maintain its independence. The South, he wrote, asked\r\nneither aid nor intervention; it merely desired recognition and\r\ncontinuation of British neutrality[712]. On the same day Mason also\r\nasked for an interview[713], but received no reply until July 31, when\r\nRussell wrote that no definite answer could be sent until \"after a\r\nCabinet\" and that an interview did not seem necessary[714].\r\n\r\nThis answer clearly indicates that the Government was in uncertainty. It\r\nis significant that Russell took this moment to reply at last to\r\nSeward's protestations of May 28[715], which had been presented to him\r\nby Adams on June 20. He instructed Stuart at Washington that his delay\r\nhad been due to a \"waiting for military events,\" but that these had\r\nbeen indecisive. He gave a résumé of all the sins of the North as a\r\nbelligerent and wrote in a distinctly captious spirit. Yet these sins\r\nhad not \"induced Her Majesty's Government to swerve an inch from an\r\nimpartial neutrality[716].\" Here was no promise of a continuance of\r\nneutrality--rather a hint of some coming change. At least one member of\r\nthe Cabinet was very ready for it. Gladstone wrote privately:\r\n\r\n     \"It is indeed much to be desired that this bloody and\r\n     purposeless conflict should cease. From the first it has been\r\n     plain enough that the whole question was whether the South\r\n     was earnest and united. That has now for some months been\r\n     demonstrated; and the fact thus established at once places\r\n     the question beyond the region even of the most brilliant\r\n     military successes[717]....\"\r\n\r\nGladstone was primarily influenced by the British commercial situation.\r\nLyons, still in England, and a consistent opponent of a change of\r\npolicy, feared this commercial influence. He wrote to Stuart:\r\n\r\n     \"...I can hardly anticipate any circumstances under which I\r\n     should think the intervention of England in the quarrel\r\n     between the North and South advisable....\r\n\r\n     \"But it is very unfortunate that no result whatever is\r\n     apparent from the nominal re-opening of New Orleans and other\r\n     ports. And the distress in the manufacturing districts\r\n     threatens to be so great that a pressure may be put upon the\r\n     Government which they will find it difficult to resist[718].\"\r\n\r\nIn Parliament sneers were indulged in by Palmerston at the expense of\r\nthe silent cotton manufacturers of Lancashire, much to the fury of\r\nCobden[719]. Of this period Arnold later sarcastically remarked that,\r\n\"The representatives of Lancashire in the Houses of Parliament did not\r\npermit the gaieties of the Exhibition season wholly to divert their\r\nattention from the distress which prevailed in the home county[720].\"\r\n\r\nBeing refused an interview, Mason transmitted to Russell on August 1 a\r\nlong appeal, rather than a demand, for recognition, using exactly those\r\narguments advanced by Lindsay in debate[721]. The answer, evidently\r\ngiven after that \"Cabinet\" for whose decision Russell had been waiting,\r\nwas dated August 2. In it Russell, as in his reply to Seward on July 28,\r\ncalled attention to the wholly contradictory statements of North and\r\nSouth on the status of the war, which, in British opinion, had not yet\r\nreached a stage positively indicative of the permanence of Southern\r\nindependence. Great Britain, therefore, still \"waited,\" but the time\r\nmight come when Southern firmness in resistance would bring\r\nrecognition[722]. The tone was more friendly than any expressions\r\nhitherto used by Russell to Southern representatives. The reply does not\r\nreveal the decision actually arrived at by the Ministry. Gladstone wrote\r\nto Argyll on August 3 that \"yesterday\" a Cabinet had been held on the\r\nquestion \"to move or not to move, in the matter of the American Civil\r\nWar....\" He had come away before a decision when it became evident the\r\nprevailing sentiment would be \"nothing shall be done until both parties\r\nare desirous of it.\" Gladstone thought this very foolish; he would have\r\nEngland approach France and Russia, but if they were not ready, wait\r\nuntil they were. \"Something, I trust, will be done before the hot\r\nweather is over to stop these frightful horrors[723].\"\r\n\r\nAll parties had been waiting since the debate of July 18 for the\r\nCabinet decision. It was at once generally known as \"no step at present\"\r\nand wisdom would have decreed quiet acquiescence. Apparently one\r\nSouthern friend, on his own initiative, felt the need to splutter. On\r\nthe next day, August 4, Lord Campbell in the Lords moved for the\r\nproduction of Russell's correspondence with Mason, making a very\r\nconfused speech. \"Society and Parliament\" were convinced the war ought\r\nto end in separation. At one time Campbell argued that reconquest of the\r\nSouth was impossible; at another that England should interfere to\r\nprevent such reconquest. Again he urged that the North was in a\r\nsituation where she could not stop the war without aid from Europe in\r\nextricating her. Probably the motion was made merely to draw from\r\nRussell an official statement. Production of the papers was refused.\r\nRussell stated that the Government still maintained its policy of strict\r\nneutrality, that if any action was to be taken it should be by all the\r\nmaritime powers and that if, in the parliamentary recess, any new policy\r\nseemed advisable he would first communicate with those powers. He also\r\ndeclared very positively that as yet no proposal had been received from\r\nany foreign power in regard to America, laying stress upon the \"perfect\r\naccord\" between Great Britain and France[724].\r\n\r\nMason commented on this speech that someone was evidently lying and\r\nnaturally believed that someone to be Russell. He hoped that France\r\nwould promptly make this clear[725]. But France gave no sign of lack of\r\n\"perfect accord.\" On the contrary Thouvenel even discouraged Slidell\r\nfrom following Mason's example of demanding recognition and the formal\r\ncommunication was withheld, Mason acquiescing[726]. Slidell thought new\r\ndisturbances in Italy responsible for this sudden lessening of French\r\ninterest in the South, but he was gloomy, seeing again the frustration\r\nof high hopes. August 24 he wrote Benjamin:\r\n\r\n     \"You will find by my official correspondence that we are\r\n     still hard and fast aground here. Nothing will float us off\r\n     but a strong and continued current of important successes in\r\n     the field.\r\n\r\n     I have no hope from England, because I am satisfied that she\r\n     desires an indefinite prolongation of the war, until the\r\n     North shall be entirely exhausted and broken down.\r\n\r\n     Nothing can exceed the selfishness of English statesmen\r\n     except their wretched hypocrisy. They are continually casting\r\n     about their disinterested magnaminity and objection of all\r\n     other considerations than those dictated by a high-toned\r\n     morality, while their entire policy is marked by egotism and\r\n     duplicity. I am getting to be heartily tired of Paris[727].\"\r\n\r\nOn August 7 Parliament adjourned, having passed on the last day of the\r\nsession an Act for the relief of the distress in Lancashire by\r\nauthorizing an extension of powers to the Poor Law Guardians. Like\r\nSlidell and Mason pro-Northern circles in London thought that in August\r\nthere had come to a disastrous end the Southern push for a change in\r\nBritish policy, and were jubilant. To be sure, Russell had merely\r\ndeclared that the time for action was \"not yet\" come, but this was\r\nregarded as a sop thrown to the South. Neither in informed Southern nor\r\nNorthern circles outside the Cabinet was there any suspicion, _except by\r\nAdams_, that in the six months elapsed since Lindsay had begun his\r\nmovement the Ministry had been slowly progressing in thoughts of\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\nIn fact the sentiment of the Cabinet as stated by Gladstone had been\r\n_favourable_ to mediation when \"both parties were ready for it\" and that\r\nsuch readiness would come soon most Members were convinced. This was a\r\nconvenient and reasonable ground for postponing action but did not\r\nimply that if the conviction were unrealized no mediation would be\r\nattempted. McClellan, driven out of the Peninsula, had been removed, and\r\nAugust saw the Northern army pressed back from Virginia soil. It was now\r\nWashington and not Richmond that seemed in danger of capture. Surely the\r\nNorth must soon realize the futility of further effort, and the reports\r\nearly in July from Washington dilated upon the rapid emergence of a\r\nstrong peace party.\r\n\r\nBut the first panic of dismay once past Stuart sent word of enormous new\r\nNorthern levies of men and of renewed courage[728]. By mid-August,\r\nwriting of cotton, he thought the prospect of obtaining any quantity of\r\nit \"seems hopeless,\" and at the same time reported the peace\r\nparty fast losing ground in the face of the great energy of the\r\nAdministration[729]. As to recognition, Stuart believed: \"There is\r\nnothing to be done in the presence of these enormous fresh levies, but\r\nto wait and see what the next two months will bring forth[730].\" The\r\nhopes of the British Ministry based on a supposed Northern weariness of\r\nthe war were being shattered. Argyll, having received from Sumner a\r\nletter describing the enthusiasm and determination of the North, wrote\r\nto Gladstone:\r\n\r\n     \"It is evident, whatever may be our opinion of the prospects\r\n     of 'the North' that they do not yet, at least, feel any\r\n     approach to such exhaustion as will lead them to admit of\r\n     mediation[731]....\"\r\n\r\nTo this Gladstone replied:\r\n\r\n     \"I agree that this is not a state of mind favourable to\r\n     mediation; and I admit it to be a matter of great difficulty\r\n     to determine when the first step ought to be taken; but I\r\n     cannot subscribe to the opinion of those who think that\r\n     Europe is to stand silent without limit of time and witness\r\n     these horrors and absurdities, which will soon have consumed\r\n     more men, and done ten times more mischief than the Crimean\r\n     War; but with the difference that there the end was\r\n     uncertain, here it is certain in the opinion of the whole\r\n     world except one of the parties. I should be puzzled to point\r\n     out a single case of dismemberment which has been settled by\r\n     the voluntary concession of the stronger party without any\r\n     interference or warning from third powers, and as far as\r\n     principle goes there never was a case in which warning was so\r\n     proper and becoming, because of the frightful misery which\r\n     this civil conflict has brought upon other countries, and\r\n     because of the unanimity with which it is condemned by the\r\n     civilized world[732].\"\r\n\r\nThe renewal of Northern energy, first reports of which were known to\r\nRussell early in August, came as a surprise to the British Ministry.\r\nTheir progress toward mediation had been slow but steady. Lindsay's\r\ninitial steps, resented as an effort in indirect diplomacy and not\r\nsupported by France officially, had received prompt rejection\r\naccompanied by no indication of a desire to depart from strict\r\nneutrality. With the cessation in late June of the Northern victorious\r\nprogress in arms and in the face of increasing distress in Lancashire,\r\nthe second answer to Lindsay was less dogmatic. As given by Palmerston\r\nthe Government desired to offer mediation, but saw no present hope of\r\ndoing so successfully. Finally the Government asked for a free hand,\r\nmaking no pledges. Mason might be gloomy, Adams exultant, but when\r\nAugust dawned plans were already on foot for a decided change. The\r\nsecret was well kept. Four days after the Cabinet decision to wait on\r\nevents, two days after Russell's refusal to produce the correspondence\r\nwith Mason, Russell, on the eve of departure for the Continent, was\r\nwriting to Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"Mercier's notion that we should make some move in October\r\n     agrees very well with yours. I shall be back in England\r\n     before October, and we could then have a Cabinet upon it. Of\r\n     course the war may flag before that.\r\n\r\n     \"I quite agree with you that a proposal for an armistice\r\n     should be the first step; but we must be prepared to answer\r\n     the question on what basis are we to negotiate[733]?\"\r\n\r\nThe next movement to put an end to the war in America was to come, not\r\nfrom Napoleon III, nor from the British friends of the South, but from\r\nthe British Ministry itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: Bancroft, _Seward_, II, p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: _De Bow's Review_, Dec., 1857, p. 592.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: Cited in Adams, _Trans-Atlantic Historical Solidarity_,\r\np. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: _Ibid._, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: Cited in Smith, _Parties and Slavery_, 68.

To Sumner, Dec. 6, 1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: The historians who see only economic causes have\r\nmisinterpreted the effects on policy of the \"cotton famine.\" Recently,\r\nalso, there has been advanced an argument that \"wheat defeated\r\ncotton\"--an idea put forward indeed in England itself during the war by\r\npro-Northern friends who pointed to the great flow of wheat from the\r\nNorth as essential in a short-crop situation in Great Britain. Mr.\r\nSchmidt in \"The Influence of Wheat and Cotton on Anglo-American\r\nRelations during the Civil War,\" a paper read before the American\r\nHistorical Association, Dec. 1917, and since published in the _Iowa\r\nJournal of History and Politics_, July, 1918, presents with much care\r\nall the important statistics for both commodities, but his conclusions\r\nseem to me wholly erroneous. He states that \"Great Britain's dependence\r\non Northern wheat ... operated as a contributing influence in keeping\r\nthe British government officially neutral ...\" (p. 423), a cautious\r\nstatement soon transformed to the positive one that \"this fact did not\r\nescape the attention of the English government,\" since leading journals\r\nreferred to it (p. 431). Progressively, it is asserted: \"But it was\r\nNorthern wheat that may well be regarded as the decisive factor,\r\ncounterbalancing the influence of cotton, in keeping the British\r\ngovernment from recognizing the Confederacy\" (p. 437). \"That the wheat\r\nsituation must have exerted a profound influence on the government ...\"\r\n(p. 438). And finally: \"In this contest wheat won, demonstrating its\r\nimportance as a world power of greater significance than cotton\" (p.\r\n439). This interesting thesis has been accepted by William Trimble in\r\n\"Historical Aspects of the Surplus Food Production of the United States,\r\n1862-1902\" (_Am. Hist. Assoc. Reports_, 1918, Vol. I, p. 224). I think\r\nMr. Schmidt's errors are: (1) a mistake as to the time when recognition\r\nof the South was in governmental consideration. He places it in\r\nmidsummer, 1863, when in fact the danger had passed by January of that\r\nyear. (2) A mistake in placing cotton and wheat supply on a parity,\r\nsince the former could not be obtained in quantity from _any_ source\r\nbefore 1864, while wheat, though coming from the United States, could\r\nhave been obtained from interior Russia, as well as from the maritime\r\nprovinces, in increased supply if Britain had been willing to pay the\r\nadded price of inland transport. There was a real \"famine\" of cotton;\r\nthere would have been none of wheat, merely a higher cost. (This fact, a\r\nvital one in determining influence, was brought out by George McHenry in\r\nthe columns of _The Index_, Sept. 18, 1862.) (3) The fact, in spite of\r\nall Mr. Schmidt's suppositions, that while cotton was frequently a\r\nsubject of governmental concern in _memoranda_ and in private notes\r\nbetween members of the Cabinet, I have failed to find one single case of\r\nthe mention of wheat. This last seems conclusive in negation of Mr.\r\nSchmidt's thesis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: Speech at Rochdale, Sept. 1, 1861.

Slidell to Benjamin, July\r\n25, 1862. It is uncertain just when Mason learned the details of\r\nSlidell's offer to France. Slidell, in his letter of July 20, wrote:\r\n\"There is an important part of our conversation that I will give you\r\nthrough Mr. Mann,\" who, apparently, was to proceed at once to London to\r\nenlighten Mason. But the Mason Papers show that Mann did not go to\r\nLondon, and that Mason was left in the dark except in so far as he could\r\nguess at what Slidell had done by reading Benjamin's instructions, sent\r\nto him by Slidell, on July 30. These did _not_ include anything on\r\nMexico, but made clear the plan of a \"special commercial advantage\" to\r\nFrance. In C.F. Adams, \"A Crisis in Downing Street,\" p. 381, it is\r\nstated that Benjamin's instructions were written \"at the time of\r\nMercier's visit to Richmond\"--with the inference that they were a result\r\nof Mercier's conversation at that time. This is an error. Benjamin's\r\ninstructions were written on April 12, and were sent on April 14, while\r\nit was not until April 16 that Mercier reached Richmond. To some it will\r\nno doubt seem inconceivable that Benjamin should not have informed\r\nMercier of his plans for France, just formulated. But here, as in\r\nChapter IX, I prefer to accept Mercier's positive assurances to Lyons at\r\ntheir face value.

Aug. 6, 1862.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRUSSELL'S MEDIATION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe adjournment of Parliament on August 7 without hint of governmental\r\ninclination to act in the American Civil War was accepted by most of the\r\nBritish public as evidence that the Ministry had no intentions in that\r\ndirection. But keen observers were not so confident. Motley, at Vienna,\r\nwas keeping close touch with the situation in England through private\r\ncorrespondence. In March, 1862, he thought that \"France and England have\r\nmade their minds up to await the issue of the present campaign\"--meaning\r\nMcClellan's advance on Richmond[734]. With the failure of that campaign\r\nhe wrote: \"Thus far the English Government have resisted his\r\n[Napoleon's] importunities. But their resistance will not last\r\nlong[735].\" Meanwhile the recently established pro-Southern weekly, _The\r\nIndex_, from its first issue, steadily insisted on the wisdom and\r\nnecessity of British action to end the war[736]. France was declared\r\nrapidly to be winning the goodwill of the South at the expense of\r\nEngland; the British aristocracy were appealed to on grounds of close\r\nsympathy with a \"Southern Aristocracy\"; mediation, at first objected to,\r\nin view of the more reasonable demand for recognition, was in the end\r\nthe chief object of _The Index_, after mid-July, when simple recognition\r\nseemed impossible of attainment[737]. Especially British humiliation\r\nbecause of the timidity of her statesmen, was harped upon and any public\r\nmanifestation of Southern sympathy was printed in great detail[738].\r\n\r\nThe speculations of Motley, the persistent agitation of _The Index_ are,\r\nhowever, no indication that either Northern fears or Southern hopes were\r\nbased on authoritative information as to governmental purpose. The plan\r\nnow in the minds of Palmerston and Russell and their steps in furthering\r\nit have been the subject of much historical study and writing. It is\r\nhere proposed to review them in the light of all available important\r\nmaterials, both old and new, using a chronological order and with more\r\ncitation than is customary, in the belief that such citations best tell\r\nthe story of this, the most critical period in the entire course of\r\nBritish attitude toward the Civil War. Here, and here only, Great\r\nBritain voluntarily approached the danger of becoming involved in the\r\nAmerican conflict[739].\r\n\r\nAmong the few who thought the withdrawal of Lindsay's motion, July 18,\r\nand the Prime Minister's comments did _not_ indicate safety for the\r\nNorth stood Adams, the American Minister. Of Palmerston's speech he\r\nwrote the next day in his diary: \"It was cautious and wise, but enough\r\ncould be gathered from it to show that mischief to us in some shape will\r\nonly be averted by the favour of Divine Providence or our own efforts.\r\nThe anxiety attending my responsibility is only postponed[740].\" At this\r\nvery moment Adams was much disturbed by his failure to secure\r\ngovernmental seizure of a war vessel being built at Liverpool for the\r\nSouth--the famous _Alabama_--which was soon completed and put to sea but\r\nten days later, July 29. Russell's delay in enforcing British\r\nneutrality, as Adams saw it, in this matter, reinforcing the latter's\r\nfears of a change in policy, had led him to explain his alarm to Seward.\r\nOn August 16 Adams received an instruction, written August 2, outlining\r\nthe exact steps to be taken in case the feared change in British policy\r\nshould occur. As printed in the diplomatic documents later presented to\r\nCongress this despatch is merely a very interesting if somewhat\r\ndiscursive essay on the inevitability of European ruminations on the\r\npossibility of interference to end the war and argues the unwisdom of\r\nsuch interference, especially for Great Britain's own interests. It does\r\nnot read as if Seward were alarmed or, indeed, as if he had given\r\nserious consideration to the supposed danger[741]. But this conveys a\r\nvery erroneous impression. An unprinted portion of the despatch very\r\nspecifically and in a very serious tone, instructs Adams that if\r\napproached by the British Government with propositions implying\r\na purpose:\r\n\r\n     \"To dictate, or to mediate, or to advise, or even to solicit\r\n     or persuade, you will answer that you are forbidden to\r\n     debate, to hear, or in any way receive, entertain or\r\n     transmit, any communication of the kind.... If you are asked\r\n     an opinion what reception the President would give to such a\r\n     proposition, if made here, you will reply that you are not\r\n     instructed, but you have no reason for supposing that it\r\n     would be entertained.\"\r\n\r\nThis was to apply either to Great Britain alone or acting in conjunction\r\nwith other Powers. Further, if the South should be \"acknowledged\" Adams\r\nwas immediately to suspend his functions. \"You will perceive,\" wrote\r\nSeward, \"that we have approached the contemplation of that crisis with\r\nthe caution which great reluctance has inspired. But I trust that you\r\nwill also have perceived that the crisis has not appalled us[742].\"\r\n\r\nThis serious and definite determination by the North to resent any\r\nintervention by Europe makes evident that Seward and Lincoln were fully\r\ncommitted to forcible resistance of foreign meddling. Briefly, if the\r\nneed arose, the North would go to war with Europe. Adams at least now\r\nknew where he stood and could but await the result. The instruction he\r\nheld in reserve, nor was it ever officially communicated to Russell. He\r\ndid, however, state its tenor to Forster who had contacts with the\r\nCabinet through Milner-Gibson and though no proof has been found that\r\nthe American determination was communicated to the Ministry, the\r\npresumption is that this occurred[743]. Such communication could not\r\nhave taken place before the end of August and possibly was not then made\r\nowing to the fact that the Cabinet was scattered in the long vacation\r\nand that, apparently, the plan to move _soon_ in the American War was as\r\nyet unknown save to Palmerston and to Russell.\r\n\r\nRussell's letter to Palmerston of August 6, sets the date of their\r\ndetermination[744]. Meanwhile they were depending much upon advices from\r\nWashington for the exact moment. Stuart was suggesting, with Mercier,\r\nthat October should be selected[745], and continued his urgings even\r\nthough his immediate chief, Lyons, was writing to him from London strong\r\npersonal objections to any European intervention whatever and especially\r\nany by Great Britain[746]. Lyons explained his objections to Russell as\r\nwell, but Stuart, having gone to the extent of consulting also with\r\nStoeckl, the Russian Minister at Washington, was now in favour of\r\nstraight-out recognition of the Confederacy as the better measure. This,\r\nthought Stoeckl, was less likely to bring on war with the North than an\r\nattempt at mediation[747]. Soon Stuart was able to give notice, a full\r\nmonth in advance of the event, of Lincoln's plan to issue an\r\nemancipation proclamation, postponed temporarily on the insistence of\r\nSeward[748], but he attached no importance to this, regarding it as at\r\nbest a measure of pretence intended to frighten the South and to\r\ninfluence foreign governments[749]. Russell was not impressed with\r\nStuart's shift from mediation to recognition. \"I think,\" he wrote, \"we\r\nmust allow the President to spend his second batch of 600,000 men before\r\nwe can hope that he and his democracy will listen to reason[750].\" But\r\nthis did not imply that Russell was wavering in the idea that October\r\nwould be a \"ripe time.\" Soon he was journeying to the Continent in\r\nattendance on the Queen and using his leisure to perfect his great\r\nplan[751].\r\n\r\nRussell's first positive step was taken on September 13. On that date\r\nhe wrote to Cowley in Paris instructing him to sound Thouvenel,\r\n_privately_[752], and the day following he wrote to Palmerston\r\ncommenting on the news just received of the exploits of Stonewall\r\nJackson in Virginia, \"it really looks as if he might end the war. In\r\nOctober the hour will be ripe for the Cabinet[753].\" Similar reactions\r\nwere expressed by Palmerston at the same moment and for the same\r\nreasons. Palmerston also wrote on September 14:\r\n\r\n     \"The Federals ... got a very complete smashing ... even\r\n     Washington or Baltimore may fall into the hands of the\r\n     Confederates.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If this should happen, would it not be time for us to\r\n     consider whether in such a state of things England and France\r\n     might not address the contending parties and recommend an\r\n     arrangement upon the basis of separation[754]?\"\r\n\r\nRussell replied:\r\n\r\n     \"... I agree with you that the time is come for offering\r\n     mediation to the United States Government, with a view to the\r\n     recognition of the independence of the Confederates. I agree\r\n     further that, in case of failure, we ought ourselves to\r\n     recognize the Southern States as an independent State. For\r\n     the purpose of taking so important a step, I think we must\r\n     have a meeting, of the Cabinet. The 23rd or 30th would suit\r\n     me for the meeting[755].\"\r\n\r\nThe two elder statesmen being in such complete accord the result of the\r\nunofficial overture to France was now awaited with interest. This,\r\nconsidering the similar unofficial suggestions previously made by\r\nNapoleon, was surprisingly lukewarm. Cowley reported that he had held a\r\nlong and serious conversation with Thouvenel on the subject of mediation\r\nas instructed by Russell on the thirteenth and found a disposition \"to\r\nwait to see the result of the elections\" in the North. Mercier\r\napparently had been writing that Southern successes would strengthen the\r\nNorthern peace party. Thouvenel's idea was that \"if the peace party\r\ngains the ascendant,\" Lincoln and Seward, both of whom were too far\r\ncommitted to listen to foreign suggestions, would \"probably be set\r\naside.\" He also emphasized the \"serious consequences\" England and France\r\nmight expect if they recognized the South.\r\n\r\n     \"I said that we might propose an armistice without mediation,\r\n     and that if the other Powers joined with us in doing so, and\r\n     let it be seen that a refusal would be followed by the\r\n     recognition of the Southern States, the certainty of such\r\n     recognition by all Europe must carry weight with it.\"\r\n\r\n     Thouvenel saw some difficulties, especially Russia.\r\n\r\n     \"...the French Government had some time back sounded that of\r\n     Russia as to her joining France and England in an offer of\r\n     mediation and had been met by an almost scornful refusal....\"\r\n\r\n     \"It appears also that there is less public pressure here for\r\n     the recognition of the South than there is in England[756].\"\r\n\r\nThouvenel's lack of enthusiasm might have operated as a check to Russell\r\nhad he not been aware of two circumstances causing less weight than\r\nformerly to be attached to the opinions of the French Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs. The first was the well-known difference on American\r\npolicy between Thouvenel and Napoleon III and the well-grounded\r\nconviction that the Emperor was at any moment ready to impose his will,\r\nif only England would give the signal. The second circumstance was still\r\nmore important. It was already known through the French press that a\r\nsharp conflict had arisen in the Government as to Italian policy and all\r\nsigns pointed to a reorganization of the Ministry which would exclude\r\nThouvenel. Under these circumstances Russell could well afford to\r\ndiscount Thouvenel's opinion. The extent to which he was ready to\r\ngo--much beyond either the offer of mediation, or of armistice evidently\r\nin Cowley's mind--is shown by a letter to Gladstone, September 26.\r\n\r\n     \"I am inclined to think that October 16 may be soon enough\r\n     for a Cabinet, if I am free to communicate the views which\r\n     Palmerston and I entertain to France and Russia in the\r\n     interval between this time and the middle of next month.\r\n     These views had the offer of mediation to both parties in the\r\n     first place, and in the case of refusal by the North, to\r\n     recognition of the South. Mediation on the basis of\r\n     separation and recognition accompanied by a declaration of\r\n     neutrality[757].\"\r\n\r\nThe perfected plan, thus outlined, had resulted from a communication to\r\nPalmerston of Cowley's report together with a memorandum, proposed to be\r\nsent to Cowley, but again _privately_[758], addressed to France alone.\r\nRussell here also stated that he had explained his ideas to the Queen.\r\n\"She only wishes Austria, Prussia and Russia to be consulted. I said\r\nthat should be done, but we must consult France first.\" Also enclosed\r\nwas a letter from Stuart of September 9, reporting Mercier as just\r\nreturned from New York and convinced that if advantage were not taken of\r\nthe present time to do exactly that which was in Russell's mind, Europe\r\nwould have to wait for the \"complete exhaustion\" of the North[759].\r\nRussell was now at home again and the next day Palmerston approved the\r\nplans as \"excellent\"; but he asked whether it would not be well to\r\ninclude Russia in the invitation as a compliment, even though \"she might\r\nprobably decline.\" As to the other European powers the matter could wait\r\nfor an \"after communication.\" Yet that Palmerston still wished to go\r\nslowly is shown by a comment on the military situation in America:\r\n\r\n     \"It is evident that a great conflict is taking place to the\r\n     north-west of Washington, and its issue must have a great\r\n     effect on the state of affairs. If the Federals sustain a\r\n     great defeat, they may be at once ready for mediation, and\r\n     the iron should be struck while it is hot. If, on the other\r\n     hand, they should have the best of it, we may wait awhile and\r\n     see what may follow[760]....\"\r\n\r\nThus through Palmerston's caution Russia had been added to France in\r\nRussell's proposed memorandum and the communication to Cowley had not\r\nbeen sent off immediately--as the letter to Gladstone of September 26\r\nindicates. But the plan was regarded as so far determined upon that on\r\nSeptember 24 Russell requested Lyons not to fix, as yet, upon a date for\r\nhis departure for America, writing, \"M. Mercier is again looking out for\r\nan opportunity to offer mediation, and this time he is not so much out\r\nin his reckoning[761].\" Curiously Mercier had again changed his mind and\r\nnow thought a proposal of an armistice was the best move, being\r\n\"particularly anxious that there should be no mention of the word\r\n_separation_,\" but of this Russell had, as yet, no inkling[762]. With\r\nfull approval of the plan as now outlined, Palmerston wrote to\r\nGladstone, September 24, that he and Russell were in complete agreement\r\nthat an offer of mediation should be made by the three maritime powers,\r\nbut that \"no actual step would be taken without the sanction of the\r\nCabinet[763].\" Two days later Russell explained to Gladstone the exact\r\nnature of the proposal[764], but that there was even now no thoroughly\r\nworked out agreement on the sequence of steps necessary is shown by\r\nPalmerston's letter to Gladstone of the twenty-fourth, in which is\r\noutlined a preliminary proposal of an armistice, cessation of blockade,\r\nand negotiation on the basis of separation[765].\r\n\r\nOther members of the Cabinet were likewise informed of the proposed\r\noverture to France and Russia and soon it was clear that there would be\r\nopposition. Granville had replaced Russell in attendance upon the Queen\r\nat Gotha. He now addressed a long and careful argument to Russell\r\nopposing the adventure, as he thought it, summing up his opinion in\r\nthis wise:\r\n\r\n     \"...I doubt, if the war continues long after our recognition\r\n     of the South, whether it will be possible for us to avoid\r\n     drifting into it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"...I have come to the conclusion that it is premature to\r\n     depart from the policy which has hitherto been adopted by you\r\n     and Lord Palmerston, and which, notwithstanding the strong\r\n     antipathy to the North, the strong sympathy with the South,\r\n     and the passionate wish to have cotton, has met with such\r\n     general approval from Parliament, the press, and the\r\n     public[766].\"\r\n\r\nBut Granville had little hope his views would prevail. A few days later\r\nhe wrote to Lord Stanley of Alderley:\r\n\r\n     \"I have written to Johnny my reasons for thinking it\r\n     decidedly premature. I, however, suspect you will settle to\r\n     do so! Pam, Johnny, and Gladstone would be in favour of it;\r\n     and probably Newcastle. I do not know about the others. It\r\n     appears to me a great mistake[767].\"\r\n\r\nOpportunely giving added effect to Granville's letter there now arrived\r\nconfused accounts from America of the battles about Washington and of a\r\ncheck to the Southern advance. On September 17 there had been fought the\r\nbattle of Antietam and two days later Lee, giving up his Maryland\r\ncampaign, began a retreat through the Shenandoah valley toward the old\r\ndefensive Southern lines before Richmond. There was no pursuit, for\r\nMcClellan, again briefly in command, thought his army too shattered for\r\nan advance. Palmerston had been counting on a great Southern victory and\r\nwas now doubtful whether the time had come after all for European\r\novertures to the contestants. October 2 he wrote Russell:\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR RUSSELL,\r\n\r\n     \"I return you Granville's letter which contains much\r\n     deserving of serious consideration. There is no doubt that\r\n     the offer of Mediation upon the basis of Separation would be\r\n     accepted by the South. Why should it not be accepted? It\r\n     would give the South in principle the points for which they\r\n     are fighting. The refusal, if refusal there was, would come\r\n     from the North, who would be unwilling to give up the\r\n     principle for which they have been fighting so long as they\r\n     had a reasonable expectation that by going on fighting they\r\n     could carry their point. The condition of things therefore\r\n     which would be favourable to an offer of mediation would be\r\n     great success of the South against the North. That state of\r\n     things seemed ten days ago to be approaching. Its advance has\r\n     been lately checked, but we do not yet know the real course\r\n     of recent events, and still less can we foresee what is about\r\n     to follow. Ten days or a fortnight more may throw a clearer\r\n     light upon future prospects.\r\n\r\n     \"As regards possible resentment on the part of the Northerns\r\n     following upon an acknowledgment of the Independence of the\r\n     South, it is quite true that we should have less to care\r\n     about that resentment in the spring when communication with\r\n     Canada was open, and when our naval force could more easily\r\n     operate upon the American coast, than in winter when we are\r\n     cut off from Canada and the American coast is not so safe.\r\n\r\n     \"But if the acknowledgment were made at one and the same time\r\n     by England, France and some other Powers, the Yankees would\r\n     probably not seek a quarrel with us alone, and would not like\r\n     one against a European Confederation. Such a quarrel would\r\n     render certain and permanent that Southern Independence the\r\n     acknowledgment of which would have caused it.\r\n\r\n     \"The first communication to be made by England and France to\r\n     the contending parties might be, not an absolute offer of\r\n     mediation but a friendly suggestion whether the time was not\r\n     come when it might be well for the two parties to consider\r\n     whether the war, however long continued, could lead to any\r\n     other result than separation; and whether it might not\r\n     therefore be best to avoid the great evils which must\r\n     necessarily flow from a prolongation of hostilities by at\r\n     once coming to an agreement to treat upon that principle of\r\n     separation which must apparently be the inevitable result of\r\n     the contest, however long it may last.\r\n\r\n     \"The best thing would be that the two parties should settle\r\n     details by direct negotiation with each other, though perhaps\r\n     with the rancorous hatred now existing between them this\r\n     might be difficult. But their quarrels in negotiation would\r\n     do us no harm if they did not lead to a renewal of war. An\r\n     armistice, if not accompanied by a cessation of blockades,\r\n     would be all in favour of the North, especially if New\r\n     Orleans remained in the hands of the North.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole matter is full of difficulty, and can only be\r\n     cleared up by some more decided events between the contending\r\n     armies....\"\r\n\r\n     PALMERSTON[768].\"\r\n\r\nVery evidently Palmerston was experiencing doubts and was all in favour\r\nof cautious delay. American military events more than Granville's\r\narguments influenced him, but almost immediately there appeared a much\r\nmore vigorous and determined opponent within the Cabinet. Cornewall\r\nLewis was prompt to express objections. October 2, Russell transmitted\r\nto Palmerston a letter of disapproval from Lewis. Russell also,\r\nmomentarily, was hesitating. He wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"This American question must be well sifted. I send you a\r\n     letter of G. Lewis who is against moving ...\"\r\n\r\n     \"My only doubt is whether we and France should stir if Russia\r\n     holds back. Her separation from our move would ensure the\r\n     rejection of our proposals. But we shall know more by the\r\n     16th. I have desired a cabinet to be summoned for that day,\r\n     but the summons will not go out till Saturday. So if you wish\r\n     to stop it, write to Hammond[769].\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that Russia had been approached[770] but that\r\nRussell's chief concern was the attitude of France, that his proposed\r\nprivate communication to Cowley had been despatched and that he was\r\nwaiting an answer which might be expected before the sixteenth. If so\r\nhis expectations were negatived by that crisis now on in the French\r\nMinistry over the Italian question prohibiting consideration of any\r\nother matter. On October 15 Thouvenel was dismissed, but his formal\r\nretirement from office did not take place until October 24. Several\r\nMinisters abroad, among them Flahault, at London, followed him into\r\nretirement and foreign affairs were temporarily in confusion[771]. The\r\nEmperor was away from Paris and all that Cowley reported was that the\r\nlast time he had seen Thouvenel the latter had merely remarked that \"as\r\nsoon as the Emperor came back the two Governments ought to enter into a\r\nserious consideration of the whole question[772]....\" Cowley himself was\r\nmore concerned that it was now becoming clear France, in spite of\r\nprevious protestations, was planning \"colonizing\" Mexico[773].\r\n\r\nUp to the end of September, therefore, the British Government, while\r\nwholly confident that France would agree in any effort whatsoever that\r\nEngland might wish to make, had no recent assurances, either official or\r\nprivate, to this effect. This did not disturb Russell, who took for\r\ngranted French approval, and soon he cast aside the hesitation caused by\r\nthe doubts of Granville, the opposition of Lewis, and the caution of\r\nPalmerston. Public opinion was certainly turning toward a demand for\r\nMinisterial action[774]. Two days of further consideration caused him to\r\nreturn to the attack; October 4 he wrote Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"I think unless some miracle takes place this will be the\r\n     very time for offering mediation, or as you suggest,\r\n     proposing to North and South to come to terms.\r\n\r\n     \"Two things however must be made clear:\r\n\r\n     (i) That we propose separation,\r\n\r\n     (ii) That we shall take no part in the war unless attacked\r\n     ourselves[775].\"\r\n\r\nHow Russell proposed to evade a war with an angry North was not made\r\nclear, but in this same letter notice was given that he was preparing a\r\nmemorandum for the Cabinet. Russell was still for a mediation on lines\r\nof separation, but his uncertainty, even confusion, of mind became\r\nevident but another two days later on receipt of a letter from Stuart,\r\nwritten September 23, in which he and Mercier were now all for a\r\nsuggestion of armistice, with no mention of separation[776]. Russell\r\nnow thought:\r\n\r\n     \"If no fresh battles occur, I think the suggestion might be\r\n     adopted, tho' I am far from thinking with Mercier that the\r\n     North would accept it. But it would be a fair and defensible\r\n     course, leaving it open to us to hasten or defer recognition\r\n     if the proposal is declined. Lord Lyons might carry it over\r\n     on the 25th[777].\"\r\n\r\nBritish policy, as represented by the inclinations of the Foreign\r\nSecretary, having started out on a course portending positive and\r\nvigorous action, was now evidently in danger of veering far to one side,\r\nif not turning completely about. But the day after Russell seemed to be\r\nconsidering such an attenuation of the earlier plan as to be content\r\nwith a mere suggestion of armistice, a bomb was thrown into the already\r\ntroubled waters further and violently disturbing them. This was\r\nGladstone's speech at Newcastle, October 7, a good third of which was\r\ndevoted to the Civil War and in which he asserted that Jefferson Davis\r\nhad made an army, was making a navy, and had created something still\r\ngreater--a nation[778]. The chronology of shifts in opinion would, at\r\nfirst glance, indicate that Gladstone made this speech with the\r\nintention of forcing Palmerston and Russell to continue in the line\r\nearlier adopted, thus hoping to bolster up a cause now losing ground.\r\nHis declaration, coming from a leading member of of the Cabinet, was\r\ncertain to be accepted by the public as a foreshadowing of governmental\r\naction. If Jefferson Davis had in truth created a nation then early\r\nrecognition must be given it. But this surmise of intentional pressure\r\nis not borne out by any discovered evidence. On the contrary, the truth\r\nis, seemingly, that Gladstone, in the north and out of touch, was in\r\ncomplete ignorance that the two weeks elapsed since his letters from\r\nPalmerston and Russell had produced any alteration of plan or even any\r\nhesitation. Himself long convinced of the wisdom of British intervention\r\nin some form Gladstone evidently could not resist the temptation to make\r\nthe good news known. His declaration, foreshadowing a policy that did\r\nnot pertain to his own department, and, more especially, that had not\r\nyet received Cabinet approval was in itself an offence against the\r\ntraditions of British Cabinet organization. He had spoken without\r\nauthorization and \"off his own bat.\"\r\n\r\nThe speculative market, sensitive barometer of governmental policy,\r\nimmediately underwent such violent fluctuations as to indicate a general\r\nbelief that Gladstone's speech meant action in the war. The price of raw\r\ncotton dropped so abruptly as to alarm Southern friends and cause them\r\nto give assurances that even if the blockade were broken there would be\r\nno immediate outpouring of cotton from Southern ports[779]. On the other\r\nhand, Bright, staunch friend of the North, _hoped_ that Gladstone was\r\nmerely seeking to overcome a half-hearted reluctance of Palmerston and\r\nRussell to move. He was sore at heart over the \"vile speech\" of \"your\r\nold acquaintance and friend[780].\" The leading newspapers while at first\r\naccepting the Newcastle speech as an authoritative statement and\r\ngenerally, though mildly, approving, were quick to feel that there was\r\nstill uncertainty of policy and became silent until it should be made\r\nclear just what was in the wind[781]. Within the Cabinet it is to be\r\nsupposed that Gladstone had caused no small stir, both by reason of his\r\nunusual procedure and by his sentiments. On Russell, however much\r\ndisliked was the incursion into his own province, the effect was\r\nreinvigoration of a desire to carry through at least some portion of the\r\nplan and he determined to go on with the proposal of an armistice. Six\r\ndays after Gladstone's speech Russell circulated, October 13, a\r\nmemorandum on America[782].\r\n\r\nThis memorandum asserted that the South had shown, conclusively, its\r\npower to resist--had maintained a successful defensive; that the notion\r\nof a strong pro-Northern element in the South had been shown to be\r\nwholly delusive; that the emancipation proclamation, promising a freeing\r\nof the slaves in the sections still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, was\r\nno humanitarian or idealistic measure (since it left slavery in the\r\nloyal or recognized districts) and was but an incitement to servile\r\nwar--a most \"terrible\" plan. For these reasons Russell urged that the\r\nGreat Powers ought seriously to consider whether it was not their duty\r\nto propose a \"suspension of arms\" for the purpose of \"weighing calmly\r\nthe advantages of peace[783].\" This was a far cry from mediation and\r\nrecognition, nor did Russell indicate either the proposed terms of an\r\narmistice or the exact steps to be taken by Europe in bringing it about\r\nand making it of value. But the memorandum of October 13 does clearly\r\nnegative what has been the accepted British political tradition which is\r\nto the effect that Palmerston, angered at Gladstone's presumption and\r\nnow determined against action, had \"put up\" Cornewall Lewis to reply in\r\na public speech, thereby permitting public information that no Cabinet\r\ndecision had as yet been reached. Lewis' speech was made at Hereford on\r\nOctober 14. Such were the relations between Palmerston and Russell that\r\nit is impossible the former would have so used Lewis without notifying\r\nRussell, in which case there would have been no Foreign Office\r\nmemorandum of the thirteenth[784]. Lewis was, in fact, vigorously\r\nmaintaining his objections, already made known to Russell, to _any_ plan\r\nof departure from the hitherto accepted policy of neutrality and his\r\nspeech at Hereford was the opening gun of active opposition.\r\n\r\nLewis did not in any sense pose as a friend of the North. Rather he\r\ntreated the whole matter, in his speech at Hereford and later in the\r\nCabinet as one requiring cool judgment and decision on the sole ground\r\nof British interests. This was the line best suited to sustain his\r\narguments, but does not prove, as some have thought, that his Cabinet\r\nacknowledgment of the impossibility of Northern complete victory, was\r\nhis private conviction[785]. At Hereford Lewis argued that everyone must\r\nacknowledge a great war was in progress and must admit it \"to be\r\nundecided. Under such circumstances, the time had not yet arrived when\r\nit could be asserted in accordance with the established doctrines of\r\ninternational law that the independence of the Southern States had been\r\nestablished[786].\" In effect Lewis gave public notice that no Cabinet\r\ndecision had yet been reached, a step equally opposed to Cabinet\r\ntraditions with Gladstone's speech, since equally unauthorized, but\r\nexcusable in the view that the first offence against tradition had\r\nforced a rejoinder[787]. For the public Lewis accomplished his purpose\r\nand the press refrained from comment, awaiting results[788]. Meanwhile\r\nPalmerston, who must finally determine policy, was remaining in\r\nuncertainty and in this situation thought it wise to consult,\r\nindirectly, Derby, the leader of the opposition in Parliament. This was\r\ndone through Clarendon, who wrote to Palmerston on October 16 that Derby\r\nwas averse to action.\r\n\r\n     \"He said that he had been constantly urged to _go in for_\r\n     recognition and mediation, but had always refused on the\r\n     ground that recognition would merely irritate the North\r\n     without advancing the cause of the South or procuring a\r\n     single bale of cotton, and that mediation in the present\r\n     temper of the Belligerents _must_ be rejected even if the\r\n     mediating Powers themselves knew what to propose as a fair\r\n     basis of compromise; for as each party insisted upon having\r\n     that which the other declared was vitally essential to its\r\n     existence, it was clear that the war had not yet marked out\r\n     the stipulations of a treaty of peace.... The recognition of\r\n     the South could be of no benefit to England unless we meant\r\n     to sweep away the blockade, which would be an act of\r\n     hostility towards the North[789].\"\r\n\r\nMore than any other member of the Cabinet Lewis was able to guess,\r\nfairly accurately, what was in the Premier's mind for Lewis was\r\nClarendon's brother-in-law, and \"the most intimate and esteemed of his\r\nmale friends[790].\" They were in constant communication as the Cabinet\r\ncrisis developed, and Lewis' next step was taken immediately after\r\nPalmerston's consultation of Derby through Clarendon. October 17, Lewis\r\ncirculated a memorandum in reply to that of Russell's of October 13. He\r\nagreed with Russell's statement of the facts of the situation in\r\nAmerica, but added with sarcasm:\r\n\r\n     \"A dispassionate bystander might be expected to concur in the\r\n     historical view of Lord Russell, and to desire that the war\r\n     should be speedily terminated by a pacific agreement between\r\n     the contending parties. But, unhappily, the decision upon any\r\n     proposal of the English Government will be made, not by\r\n     dispassionate bystanders, but by heated and violent\r\n     partisans; and we have to consider, not how the proposal\r\n     indicated in the Memorandum ought to be received, or how it\r\n     would be received by a conclave of philosophers, but how it\r\n     is likely to be received by the persons to whom it would be\r\n     addressed.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's emancipation proclamation, Lewis admitted, presumably was\r\nintended to incite servile war, but that very fact was an argument\r\nagainst, not for, British action, since it revealed an intensity of\r\nbitterness prohibitory of any \"calm consideration\" of issues by the\r\nbelligerents. And suppose the North did acquiesce in an armistice the\r\nonly peaceful solution would be an independent slave-holding South for\r\nthe establishment of which Great Britain would have become intermediary\r\nand sponsor. Any policy except that of the continuance of strict\r\nneutrality was full of dangers, some evident, some but dimly visible as\r\nyet. Statesmanship required great caution; \"... looking to the probable\r\nconsequences,\" Lewis concluded, \"of this philanthropic proposition, we\r\nmay doubt whether the chances of evil do not preponderate over the\r\nchances of good, and whether it is not--\r\n\r\n     'Better to endure the ills we have\r\n     Than fly to others which we know not of[791].'\"\r\n\r\nAt the exact time when Lewis thus voiced his objections, basing them on\r\nthe lack of any sentiment toward peace in America, there were received\r\nat the Foreign Office and read with interest the reports of a British\r\nspecial agent sent out from Washington on a tour of the Western States.\r\nAnderson's reports emphasized three points:\r\n\r\n(1) Emancipation was purely a war measure with no thought of\r\nameliorating the condition of the slaves once freed;\r\n\r\n(2) Even if the war should stop there was no likelihood of securing\r\ncotton for a long time to come;\r\n\r\n(3) The Western States, even more then the Eastern, were in favour of\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war and the new call for men was being met\r\nwith enthusiasm[792].\r\n\r\nThis was unpromising either for relief to a distressed England or for\r\nNorthern acceptance of an armistice, yet Russell, commenting on\r\nClarendon's letter to Palmerston, containing Derby's advice, still\r\nargued that even if declined a suggestion of armistice could do no harm\r\nand might open the way for a later move, but he agreed that recognition\r\n\"would certainly be premature at present[793].\" Russell himself now\r\nheard from Clarendon and learned that Derby \"had been constantly urged\r\nto press for recognition and mediation but he had always refused on the\r\nground that the neutral policy hitherto pursued by the Government was\r\nthe right one and that if we departed from it we should only meet with\r\nan insolent rejection of our offer[794].\" A long conference with Lyons\r\ngave cause for further thought and Russell committed himself to the\r\nextent that he acknowledged \"we ought not to move _at present_ without\r\nRussia[795]....\" Finally, October 22, Palmerston reached a decision for\r\nthe immediate present, writing to Russell:\r\n\r\n     \"Your description of the state of things between the two\r\n     parties is most comprehensive and just. I am, however, much\r\n     inclined to agree with Lewis that at present we could take no\r\n     step nor make any communication of a distinct proposition\r\n     with any advantage.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"All that we could possibly do without injury to our position\r\n     would be to ask the two Parties not whether they would agree\r\n     to an armistice but whether they might not turn their\r\n     thoughts towards an arrangement between themselves. But the\r\n     answer of each might be written by us beforehand. The\r\n     Northerners would say that the only condition of arrangement\r\n     would be the restoration of the Union; the South would say\r\n     their only condition would be an acknowledgment by the North\r\n     of Southern Independence--we should not be more advanced and\r\n     should only have pledged each party more strongly to the\r\n     object for which they are fighting. I am therefore inclined\r\n     to change the opinion on which I wrote to you when the\r\n     Confederates seemed to be carrying all before them, and I am\r\n     very much come back to our original view of the matter, that\r\n     we must continue merely to be lookers-on till the war shall\r\n     have taken a more decided turn[796].\"\r\n\r\nBy previous arrangement the date October 23 had been set for a Cabinet\r\nto consider the American question but Russell now postponed it, though a\r\nfew members appeared and held an informal discussion in which Russell\r\nstill justified his \"armistice\" policy and was opposed by Lewis and the\r\nmajority of those present. Palmerston did not attend, no action was\r\npossible and technically no Cabinet was held[797]. It soon appeared that\r\nRussell, vexed at the turn matters had taken, was reluctant in yielding\r\nand did not regard the question as finally settled. Yet on the afternoon\r\nof this same day Adams, much disturbed by the rumours attendant upon the\r\nspeeches of Gladstone and Lewis, sought an explanation from Russell and\r\nwas informed that the Government was not inclined at present to change\r\nits policy but could make no promises for the future[798]. This appeared\r\nto Adams to be an assurance against _any_ effort by Great Britain and\r\nhas been interpreted as disingenuous on Russell's part. Certainly Adams'\r\nconfidence was restored by the interview. But Russell was apparently\r\nunconvinced as yet that a suggestion of armistice would necessarily lead\r\nto the evil consequences prophesied by Lewis, or would, indeed, require\r\nany departure from a policy of strict neutrality. On the one side\r\nRussell was being berated by pro-Southerners as weakly continuing an\r\noutworn policy and as having \"made himself the laughing-stock of Europe\r\nand of America[799];\" on the other he was regarded, for the moment, as\r\ninsisting, through pique, on a line of action highly dangerous to the\r\npreservation of peace with the North. October 23 Palmerston wrote his\r\napproval of the Cabinet postponement, but declared Lewis' doctrine of\r\n\"no recognition of Southern independence until the North had admitted\r\nit\" was unsound[800]. The next day he again wrote: \"... to talk to the\r\nbelligerents about peace at present would be as useless as asking the\r\nwinds during the last week to let the waters remain calm[801].\"\r\n\r\nThis expression by Palmerston on the day after the question apparently\r\nhad come to a conclusion was the result of the unexpected persistence of\r\nRussell and Gladstone. Replying to Palmerston's letter of the\r\ntwenty-third, Russell wrote: \"As no good could come of a Cabinet, I put\r\nit off. But tho' I am quite ready to agree to your conclusions for the\r\npresent, I cannot do so for G. Lewis' reasons....\"\r\n\r\n     \"G. Lewis besides has made a proposition for me which I never\r\n     thought of making. He says I propose that England and France\r\n     and perhaps some one Continental power should ask America to\r\n     suspend the war. I never thought of making such a proposal.\r\n\r\n     \"I think if Russia agreed Prussia would. And if France and\r\n     England agreed Austria would. Less than the whole five would\r\n     not do. I thought it right towards the Cabinet to reserve any\r\n     specific proposition. I am not at all inclined to adopt G.\r\n     Lewis' invention.\r\n\r\n     \"I have sent off Lyons without instructions, at which he is\r\n     much pleased[802].\"\r\n\r\nRussell was shifting ground; first the proposal was to have been made by\r\nEngland and France; then Russia was necessary; now \"less than five\r\npowers would not do.\" But whatever the number required he still desired\r\na proposal of armistice. On October 23, presumably subsequent to the\r\ninformal meeting of Cabinet members, he drew up a brief memorandum in\r\nanswer to that of Lewis on October 17, denying that Lewis had correctly\r\ninterpreted his plan, and declaring that he had always had \"in\r\ncontemplation\" a step by the five great powers of Europe. The\r\nadvisability of trying to secure such joint action, Russell asserted,\r\nwas all he had had in mind. _If_ the Cabinet had approved this\r\nadvisability, and the powers were acquiescent, _then_ (in answer to\r\nLewis' accusation of \"no look ahead\") he would be ready with definite\r\nplans for the negotiation of peace between North and South[803]. Thus by\r\nletter to Palmerston and by circulation of a new memorandum Russell gave\r\nnotice that all was not yet decided. On October 24, Gladstone also\r\ncirculated a memorandum in reply to Lewis, urging action by England,\r\nFrance and Russia[804].\r\n\r\nRussell's second memorandum was not at first taken seriously by his\r\nCabinet opponents. They believed the issue closed and Russell merely\r\nputting out a denial of alleged purposes. Clarendon, though not a member\r\nof the Cabinet, was keeping close touch with the situation and on\r\nOctober 24 wrote to Lewis:\r\n\r\n     \"Thanks for sending me your memorandum on the American\r\n     question, which I have read with great satisfaction. Johnny\r\n     [Russell] always loves to do something when to do nothing is\r\n     prudent, and I have no doubt that he hoped to get support in\r\n     his meddling proclivities when he called a Cabinet for\r\n     yesterday; but its postponement _sine die_ is probably due to\r\n     your memorandum. You have made so clear the idiotic position\r\n     we should occupy, either in having presented our face\r\n     gratuitously to the Yankee slap we should receive, or in\r\n     being asked what practical solution we had to propose after\r\n     an armistice had been agreed to at our suggestion, that no\r\n     discussion on the subject would have been possible, and the\r\n     Foreign Secretary probably thought it would be pleasanter to\r\n     draw in his horns at Woburn than in Downing Street[805].\"\r\n\r\nOn October 26, having received from Lewis a copy of Russell's\r\nnewly-circulated paper, Clarendon wrote again:\r\n\r\n     \"The Foreign Secretary's _blatt_ exhibits considerable\r\n     soreness, for which you are specially bound to make\r\n     allowance, as it was you who procured abortion for him. He\r\n     had thought to make a great deal of his colt by Meddler out\r\n     of Vanity, and you have shown his backers that the animal was\r\n     not fit to start and would not run a yard if he did. He is\r\n     therefore taken back to the country, where he must have a\r\n     deal more training before he can appear in public again.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I should say that your speech at Hereford was nearly as\r\n     effective in checking the alarm and speculation caused by\r\n     Gladstone's speech, as your memorandum was in smashing the\r\n     Foreign Secretary's proposed intervention, and that you did\r\n     so without in the smallest degree committing either the\r\n     Government or yourself with respect to the future[806].\"\r\n\r\nIn effect Clarendon was advising Lewis to pay no attention to Russell's\r\ncomplaining rejoinder since the object desired had been secured, but\r\nthere was still one element of strength for Russell and Gladstone which,\r\nif obtained, might easily cause a re-opening of the whole question.\r\nThis was the desire of France, still unexpressed in spite of indirect\r\novertures, a silence in part responsible for the expression of an\r\nopinion by Palmerston that Napoleon's words could not be depended upon\r\nas an indication of what he intended to do[807]. On the day this was\r\nwritten the French ministerial crisis--the real cause of Napoleon's\r\nsilence--came to an end with the retirement of Thouvenel and the\r\nsuccession of Drouyn de Lhuys. Russell's reply to Palmerston's assertion\r\nof the folly of appealing now to the belligerents was that \"recognition\"\r\nwas certainly out of the question for the present and that \"it should\r\nnot take place till May Or June next year, when circumstances may show\r\npretty clearly whether Gladstone was right[808].\" But this yielding to\r\nthe Premier's decision was quickly withdrawn when, at last, Napoleon and\r\nhis new Minister could turn their attention to the American question.\r\n\r\nOn October 27 Cowley reported a conversation with the Emperor in which\r\nAmerican affairs were discussed. Napoleon hoped that England, France and\r\nRussia would join in an offer of mediation. Cowley replied that he had\r\nno instructions and Napoleon then modified his ideas by suggesting a\r\nproposal of armistice for six months \"in order to give time for the\r\npresent excitement to calm down[809]....\" The next day Cowley reported\r\nthat Drouyn de Lhuys stated the Emperor to be very anxious to \"put an\r\nend to the War,\" but that he was himself doubtful whether it would not\r\nbe better to \"wait a little longer,\" and in any case if overtures to\r\nAmerica were rejected Russia probably would not join Great Britain and\r\nFrance in going on to a recognition of the South[810]. All this was\r\nexactly in line with that plan to which Russell had finally come and if\r\nofficially notified to the British Government would require a renewed\r\nconsideration by the Cabinet. Presumably Napoleon knew what had been\r\ngoing on in London and he now hastened to give the needed French push.\r\nOctober 28, Slidell was summoned to an audience and told of the\r\nEmperor's purpose, acting with England, to bring about an\r\narmistice[811]. Three days later, October 31, Cowley wrote that he had\r\nnow been officially informed by Drouyn de Lhuys, \"by the Emperor's\r\norders\" that a despatch was about to be sent to the French Ministers in\r\nEngland and Russia instructing them to request joint action by the three\r\npowers in suggesting an armistice of six months _including a suspension\r\nof the blockade_, thus throwing open Southern ports to European\r\ncommerce[812].\r\n\r\nNapoleon's proposal evidently took Palmerston by surprise and was not\r\nregarded with favour. He wrote to Russell:\r\n\r\n     \"As to the French scheme of proposals to the United States,\r\n     we had better keep that question till the Cabinet meets,\r\n     which would be either on Monday 11th, or Wednesday 12th, as\r\n     would be most convenient to you and our colleagues. But is\r\n     it likely that the Federals would consent to an armistice to\r\n     be accompanied by a cessation of Blockades, and which would\r\n     give the Confederates means of getting all the supplies they\r\n     may want?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Then comes the difficulty about slavery and the giving up of\r\n     runaway slaves, about which we could hardly frame a proposal\r\n     which the Southerns would agree to, and people of England\r\n     would approve of. The French Government are more free from\r\n     the shackles of principle and of right and wrong on these\r\n     matters, as on all others than we are. At all events it would\r\n     be wiser to wait till the elections in North America are over\r\n     before any proposal is made. As the Emperor is so anxious to\r\n     put a stop to bloodshed he might try his hand as a beginning\r\n     by putting down the stream of ruffians which rolls out from\r\n     that never-failing fountain at Rome[813].\"\r\n\r\nBut Russell was more optimistic, or at least in favour of some sort of\r\nproposal to America. He replied to Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"My notion is that as there is little chance of our good\r\n     offices being accepted in America we should make them such as\r\n     would be creditable to us in Europe. I should propose to\r\n     answer the French proposal therefore by saying,\r\n\r\n     \"That in offering our good offices we ought to require both\r\n     parties to consent to examine, first, whether there are any\r\n     terms upon which North and South would consent to restore the\r\n     Union; and secondly, failing any such terms, whether there\r\n     are any terms upon which both would consent to separate.\r\n\r\n     \"We should also say that if the Union is to be restored it\r\n     would be essential in our view, that after what has taken\r\n     place all the slaves should be emancipated, compensation\r\n     being granted by Congress at the rate at which Great Britain\r\n     emancipated her slaves in 1833.\r\n\r\n     \"If separation takes place we must be silent on the trend of\r\n     slavery, as we are with regard to Spain and Brazil.\r\n\r\n     \"This is a rough sketch, but I will expand it for the\r\n     Cabinet.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be an honourable proposal to make, but the North and\r\n     probably the South will refuse it[814].\"\r\n\r\nHere were several ideas quite impossible of acceptance by North and\r\nSouth in their then frame of mind and Russell himself believed them\r\ncertain to be refused by the North in any case. But he was eager to\r\npresent the question for Cabinet discussion hoping for a reversal of the\r\nprevious decision. Whether from pique or from conviction of the wisdom\r\nof a change in British policy, he proposed to press for acceptance of\r\nthe French plan, with modifications. The news of Napoleon's offer and of\r\nRussell's attitude, with some uncertainty as to that of Palmerston,\r\nagain brought Lewis into action and on November 7 he circulated another\r\nmemorandum, this time a very long one of some fifteen thousand words.\r\nThis was in the main an historical résumé of past British policy in\r\nrelation to revolted peoples, stating the international law of such\r\ncases, and pointing out that Great Britain had never recognized a\r\nrevolted people so long as a _bona fide_ struggle was still going on.\r\nPeace was no doubt greatly to be desired. \"If England could, by\r\nlegitimate means, and without unduly sacrificing or imperilling her own\r\ninterests, accelerate this consummation, she would, in my opinion, earn\r\nthe just gratitude of the civilized world.\" But the question, as he had\r\npreviously asserted, was full of grave dangers. The very suggestion of a\r\nconcert of Powers was itself one to be avoided. \"A conference of the\r\nfive great Powers is an imposing force, but it is a dangerous body to\r\nset in motion. A single intervening Power may possibly contrive to\r\nsatisfy both the adverse parties; but five intervening Powers have first\r\nto satisfy one another.\" Who could tell what divergence might arise on\r\nthe question of slavery, or on boundaries, or how far England might\r\nfind her ideals or her vital interests compromised[815]?\r\n\r\nHere was vigorous resistance to Russell, especially effective for its\r\nappeal to past British policy, and to correct practice in international\r\nlaw. On the same day that Lewis' memorandum was circulated, there\r\nappeared a communication in the _Times_ by \"Historicus,\" on \"The\r\nInternational Doctrine of Recognition,\" outlining in briefer form\r\nexactly those international law arguments presented by Lewis, and\r\nadvocating a continuation of the policy of strict neutrality.\r\n\"Historicus\" was William Vernon Harcourt, husband of Lewis' stepdaughter\r\nwho was also the niece of Clarendon. Evidently the family guns were all\r\ntrained on Russell[816]. \"Historicus\" drove home the fact that premature\r\naction by a neutral was a \"hostile act\" and ought to be resented by the\r\n\"Sovereign State\" as a \"breach of neutrality and friendship[817].\"\r\n\r\nThus on receipt of the news of Napoleon's proposal the Cabinet crisis\r\nwas renewed and even more sharply than on October 23. The French offer\r\nwas not actually presented until November 10[818]. On the next two days\r\nthe answer to be made received long discussion in the Cabinet. Lewis\r\ndescribed this to Clarendon, prefacing his account by stating that\r\nRussell had heard by telegram from Napier at St. Petersburg to the\r\neffect that Russia would not join but would support English-French\r\nproposals through her Minister at Washington, \"provided it would not\r\ncause irritation[819].\"\r\n\r\n     \"Having made this statement, Lord John proceeded to explain\r\n     his views on the question. These were, briefly, that the\r\n     recent successes of the Democrats afforded a most favourable\r\n     opportunity of intervention, because we should strengthen\r\n     their hands, and that if we refused the invitation of France,\r\n     Russia would reconsider her decision, act directly with\r\n     France, and thus accomplish her favourite purpose of\r\n     separating France and England. He therefore advised that the\r\n     proposal of France should be accepted. Palmerston followed\r\n     Lord John, and supported him, but did not say a great deal.\r\n     His principal argument was the necessity for showing sympathy\r\n     with Lancashire, and of not throwing away any chance of\r\n     mitigating it [_sic_].\r\n\r\n     \"The proposal was now thrown before the Cabinet, who\r\n     proceeded to pick it to pieces. Everybody present threw a\r\n     stone at it of greater or less size, except Gladstone, who\r\n     supported it, and the Chancellor [Westbury] and Cardwell, who\r\n     expressed no opinion. The principal objection was that the\r\n     proposed armistice of six months by sea and land, involving a\r\n     suspension of the commercial blockade, was so grossly\r\n     unequal--so decidedly in favour of the South, that there was\r\n     no chance of the North agreeing to it. After a time,\r\n     Palmerston saw that the general feeling of the Cabinet was\r\n     against being a party to the representation, and he\r\n     capitulated. I do not think his support was very sincere: it\r\n     certainly was not hearty ... I ought to add that, after the\r\n     Cabinet had come to a decision and the outline of a draft had\r\n     been discussed, the Chancellor uttered a few oracular\r\n     sentences on the danger of refusing the French invitation,\r\n     and gave a strong support to Lord John. His support came\r\n     rather late ... I proposed that we should _tater le terrain_\r\n     at Washington and ascertain whether there was any chance of\r\n     the proposal being accepted. Lord John refused this. He\r\n     admitted there was no chance of an affirmative answer from\r\n     Washington. I think his principal motive was a fear of\r\n     displeasing France, and that Palmerston's principal motive\r\n     was a wish to seem to support him. There is a useful article\r\n     in to-day's _Times_ throwing cold water on the invitation. I\r\n     take for granted that Delane was informed of the result of\r\n     the Cabinet[820].\"\r\n\r\nGladstone, writing to his wife, gave a similar though more brief\r\naccount:\r\n\r\n     \"Nov. 11. We have had our Cabinet to-day and meet again\r\n     to-morrow. I am afraid we shall do little or nothing in the\r\n     business of America. But I will send you definite\r\n     intelligence. Both Lords Palmerston and Russell are _right._\r\n     Nov. 12. The United States affair has ended and not well.\r\n     Lord Russell rather turned tail. He gave way without\r\n     resolutely fighting out his battle. However, though we\r\n     decline for the moment, the answer is put upon grounds and in\r\n     terms which leave the matter very open for the future. Nov.\r\n     13. I think the French will make our answer about America\r\n     public; at least it is very possible. But I hope they may not\r\n     take it as a positive refusal, or at any rate that they may\r\n     themselves act in the matter. It will be clear that we concur\r\n     with them, that the war should cease. Palmerston gave to\r\n     Russell's proposal a feeble and half-hearted support[821].\"\r\n\r\nThe reply to France was in fact immediately made public both in France\r\nand in England. It was complimentary to the Emperor's \"benevolent views\r\nand humane intentions,\" agreed that \"if the steps proposed were to be\r\ntaken, the concurrence of Russia would be extremely desirable\" but\r\nremarked that as yet Great Britain had not been informed that Russia\r\nwished to co-operate, and concluded that since there was no ground to\r\nhope the North was ready for the proposal it seemed best to postpone any\r\noverture until there was a \"greater prospect than now exists of its\r\nbeing accepted by the two contending parties[822].\" The argument of\r\nRussell in the Cabinet had been for acceptance without Russia though\r\nearlier he had stipulated her assistance as essential. This was due to\r\nthe knowledge already at hand through a telegram from Napier at St.\r\nPetersburg, November 8, that Russia would refuse[823]. But in the answer\r\nto France it is the attitude of Russia that becomes an important reason\r\nfor British refusal as, indeed, it was the basis for harmonious decision\r\nwithin the British Cabinet. This is not to say that had Russia acceded\r\nEngland also would have done so, for the weight of Cabinet opinion,\r\nadroitly encouraged by Palmerston, was against Russell and the result\r\nreached was that which the Premier wished. More important in his view\r\nthan any other matter was the preservation of a united Ministry and at\r\nthe conclusion of the American debate even Gladstone could write: \"As to\r\nthe state of matters generally in the Cabinet, I have never seen it\r\nsmoother[824].\"\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in England in the main heartily supported the Cabinet\r\ndecision. Hammond described it as \"almost universal in this country\r\nagainst interference[825],\" an estimate justified if the more important\r\njournals are taken into account but not true of all. The _Times_ of\r\nNovember 13 declared:\r\n\r\n     \"We are convinced that the present is not the moment for\r\n     these strong measures. There is now great reason to hope that\r\n     by means of their own internal action the Americans may\r\n     themselves settle their own affairs even sooner than Europe\r\n     could settle them for them. We have waited so long that it\r\n     would be unpardonable in us to lose the merit of our\r\n     self-denial at such a moment as this.... We quite agree with\r\n     Mr. Cobden that it would be cheaper to keep all Lancashire on\r\n     turtle and venison than to plunge into a desperate war with\r\n     the Northern States of America, even with all Europe at our\r\n     back. In a good cause, and as a necessity forced upon us in\r\n     defence of our honour, or of our rightful interests, we are\r\n     as ready to fight as we ever were; but we do not see our duty\r\n     or our interest in going blindfold into an adventure such as\r\n     this. We very much doubt, more over, whether, if Virginia\r\n     belonged to France as Canada belongs to England, the Emperor\r\n     of the French would be so active in beating up for recruits\r\n     in this American mediation league.\"\r\n\r\nThis was followed up two days later by an assertion that no English\r\nstatesman had at any time contemplated an offer of mediation made in\r\nsuch a way as to lead to actual conflict with the United States[826]. On\r\nthe other hand the _Herald_, always intense in its pro-Southern\r\nutterances, and strongly anti-Palmerston in politics, professed itself\r\nunable to credit the rumoured Cabinet decision. \"Until we are positively\r\ninformed that our Ministers are guilty of the great crime attributed to\r\nthem,\" the _Herald_ declared, \"we must hope against hope that they are\r\ninnocent.\" If guilty they were responsible for the misery of Lancashire\r\n(depicted in lurid colours):\r\n\r\n     \"A clear, a sacred, an all-important duty was imposed upon\r\n     them; to perform that duty would have been the pride and\r\n     delight of almost any other Englishmen; and they, with the\r\n     task before them and the power to perform it in their\r\n     hands--can it be that they have shrunk back in craven\r\n     cowardice, deserted their ally, betrayed their country,\r\n     dishonoured their own names to all eternity, that they might\r\n     do the bidding of John Bright, and sustain for a while the\r\n     infamous tyranny of a Butler, a Seward, and a Lincoln[827]?\"\r\n\r\nIn the non-political _Army and Navy Gazette_ the returned editor, W.H.\r\nRussell, but lately the _Times_ correspondent in America, jeered at the\r\nAmerican uproar that might now be expected against France instead of\r\nEngland: \"Let the Emperor beware. The scarred veteran of the New York\r\nScarrons of Plum Gut has set his sinister or dexter eye upon him, and\r\nthreatens him with the loss of his throne,\" but the British public must\r\nexpect no lasting change of Northern attitude toward England and must be\r\nready for a war if the North were victorious[828]. _Blackwood's_ for\r\nNovember, 1862, strongly censured the Government for its failure to act.\r\nThe _Edinburgh_ for January, 1863, as strongly supported the Ministry\r\nand expanded on the fixed determination of Great Britain to keep out of\r\nthe war. _The Index_ naturally frothed in angry disappointment,\r\ncontinuing its attacks, as if in hopes of a reversal of Ministerial\r\ndecision, even into the next year. \"Has it come to this? Is England, or\r\nthe English Cabinet, afraid of the Northern States? Lord Russell might\r\ncontrive so to choose his excuses as not to insult at once both his\r\ncountry and her ally[829].\" An editorial from the _Richmond_ (Virginia)\r\n_Whig_ was quoted with approval characterizing Russell and Palmerston as\r\n\"two old painted mummies,\" who secretly were rejoiced at the war in\r\nAmerica as \"threatening the complete annihilation\" of both sides, and\r\nexpressing the conviction that if the old Union were restored both North\r\nand South would eagerly turn on Great Britain[830]. The explanation,\r\nsaid _The Index_, of British supineness was simply the pusillanimous\r\nfear of war--and of a war that would not take place in spite of the\r\nbluster of Lincoln's \"hangers-on[831].\" Even as late as May of the year\r\nfollowing, this explanation was still harped upon and Russell \"a\r\nstatesman\" who belonged \"rather to the past than to the present\" was\r\nprimarily responsible for British inaction. \"The nominal conduct of\r\nForeign Affairs is in the hands of a diplomatic Malaprop, who has never\r\nshown vigour, activity, or determination, except where the display of\r\nthese qualities was singularly unneeded, or even worse than\r\nuseless[832].\"\r\n\r\n_The Index_ never wavered from its assumption that in the Cabinet\r\nRussell was the chief enemy of the South. Slidell, better informed,\r\nwrote: \"Who would have believed that Earl Russell would have been the\r\nonly member of the Cabinet besides Gladstone in favour of accepting the\r\nEmperor's proposition[833]?\" He had information that Napoleon had been\r\nled to expect his proposal would be accepted and was much irritated--so\r\nmuch so that France would now probably act alone[834]. Gladstone's\r\nattitude was a sorrow to many of his friends. Bright believed he was at\r\nlast weaned from desires for mediation and sympathetic with the answer\r\nto France[835], but Goldwin Smith in correspondence with Gladstone on\r\nAmerican affairs knew that the wild idea now in the statesman's mind was\r\nof offering Canada to the North if she would let the South go[836]--a\r\nplan unknown, fortunately for Gladstone's reputation for good judgment,\r\nsave to his correspondent.\r\n\r\nIn general, as the weeks passed, the satisfaction grew both with the\r\npublic and in the Government that England had made no adventure of new\r\npolicy towards America. This satisfaction was strongly reinforced when\r\nthe first reports were received from Lyons on his arrival in America.\r\nReaching New York on November 8 he found that even the \"Conservatives\"\r\nwere much opposed to an offer of mediation at present and thought it\r\nwould only do harm until there was a change of Government in\r\nWashington--an event still remote. Lyons himself believed mediation\r\nuseless unless intended to be followed by recognition of the South and\r\nthat such recognition was likewise of no value without a raising of the\r\nblockade for which he thought the British Cabinet not prepared[837].\r\nLyons flatly contradicted Stuart's reports, his cool judgment of\r\nconditions nowhere more clearly manifested than at this juncture in\r\ncomparison with his subordinate's excited and eager pro-Southern\r\narguments. Again on November 28 Lyons wrote that he could not find a\r\nsingle Northern paper that did not repudiate foreign intervention[838].\r\nIn the South, when it was learned that France had offered to act and\r\nEngland had refused, there was an outburst of bitter anti-British\r\nfeeling[839].\r\n\r\nThe Northern press, as Lyons had reported, was unanimous in rejection of\r\nEuropean offers of aid, however friendly, in settling the war. It\r\nexpressed no gratitude to England, devoting its energy rather to\r\nanimadversions on Napoleon III who was held to be personally\r\nresponsible. Since there had been no European offer made there was no\r\ncause for governmental action. Seward had given Adams specific\r\ninstructions in case the emergency arose but there had been no reason to\r\npresent these or to act upon them and the crisis once past Seward\r\nbelieved all danger of European meddling was over and permanently. He\r\nwrote to Bigelow: \"We are no longer to be disturbed by Secession\r\nintrigues in Europe. They have had their day. We propose to forget\r\nthem[840].\" This was a wise and statesmanlike attitude and was shared by\r\nAdams in London. Whatever either man knew or guessed of the prelude to\r\nthe answer to France, November 13, they were careful to accept that\r\nanswer as fulfilment of Russell's declaration to Adams, October 23, that\r\nGreat Britain intended no change of policy[841].\r\n\r\nSo far removed was Seward's attitude toward England from that ascribed\r\nto him in 1861, so calm was his treatment of questions now up for\r\nimmediate consideration, so friendly was he personally toward Lyons,\r\nthat the British Minister became greatly alarmed when, shortly after his\r\nreturn to Washington, there developed a Cabinet controversy threatening\r\nthe retirement of the Secretary of State. This was a quarrel brought on\r\nby the personal sensibilities of Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\ndirected at Seward's conduct of foreign affairs. It was quieted by the\r\ntact and authority of Lincoln, who, when Seward handed in his\r\nresignation, secured from Chase a similar offer of resignation, refused\r\nboth and in the result read to Chase that lesson of Presidential control\r\nwhich Seward had learned in May, 1861. Lyons wrote of this controversy\r\n\"I shall be sorry if it ends in the removal of Mr. Seward. We are much\r\nmore likely to have a man less disposed to keep the peace than a man\r\nmore disposed to do so. I should hardly have said this two years\r\nago[842].\" After the event of Seward's retention of office Russell\r\nwrote: \"I see Seward stays in. I am very glad of it[843].\" This is a\r\nremarkable reversal of former opinion. A better understanding of Seward\r\nhad come, somewhat slowly, to British diplomats, but since his action in\r\nthe _Trent_ affair former suspicion had steadily waned; his \"high tone\"\r\nbeing regarded as for home consumption, until now there was both belief\r\nin Seward's basic friendliness and respect for his abilities.\r\n\r\nThus Russell's ambitious mediation projects having finally dwindled to a\r\npolite refusal of the French offer to join in a mere suggestion of\r\narmistice left no open sores in the British relations with America. The\r\nprojects were unknown; the refusal seemed final to Seward and was indeed\r\ndestined to prove so. But of this there was no clear conception in the\r\nBritish Cabinet. Hardly anyone yet believed that reconquest of the South\r\nwas even a remote possibility and this foretold that the day must some\r\ntime come when European recognition would have to be given the\r\nConfederacy. It is this unanimity of opinion on the ultimate result of\r\nthe war in America that should always be kept in mind in judging the\r\nattitude of British Government and people in the fall of 1862. Their\r\nsympathies were of minor concern at the moment, nor were they much in\r\nevidence during the Cabinet crisis. All argument was based upon the\r\nexpediency and wisdom of the present proposal. Could European nations\r\n_now_ act in such a way as to bring to an early end a war whose result\r\nin separation was inevitable? It was the hope that such action promised\r\ngood results which led Russell to enter upon his policy even though\r\npersonally his sympathies were unquestionably with the North. It was, in\r\nthe end, the conviction that _now_ was not a favourable time which\r\ndetermined Palmerston, though sympathetic with the South, to withdraw\r\nhis support when Russell, through pique, insisted on going on. Moreover\r\nboth statesmen were determined not to become involved in the war and as\r\nthe possible consequences of even the \"most friendly\" offers were\r\nbrought out in discussion it became clear that Great Britain's true\r\npolicy was to await a return of sanity in the contestants[844].\r\n\r\nFor America Russell's mediation plan constitutes the most dangerous\r\ncrisis in the war for the restoration of the Union. Had that plan been\r\nadopted, no matter how friendly in intent, there is little question that\r\nLewis' forebodings would have been realized and war would have ensued\r\nbetween England and the North. But also whatever its results in other\r\nrespects the independence of the South would have been established.\r\nSlavery, hated of Great Britain, would have received a new lease of\r\nlife--and by British action. In the Cabinet argument all parties agreed\r\nthat Lincoln's emancipation proclamation was but an incitement to\r\nservile war and it played no part in the final decision. Soon that\r\nproclamation was to erect a positive barrier of public opinion against\r\nany future efforts to secure British intervention. Never again was there\r\nserious governmental consideration of meddling in the American Civil\r\nWar[845].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: Motley, _Correspondence_, II, 71.

(2) Much\r\nimportance attached to the adhesion of Russia. (3) Excellent chance of\r\nsuccess. (4) Nevertheless a possible refusal by the United States, in\r\nwhich case, (5) recognition by Great Britain of the South if it seemed\r\nlikely that this could be done without giving the United States a just\r\nground of quarrel.

Slidell had an important\r\ninterview with Napoleon on October 28 bearing on an armistice, but this\r\nwas copied as October 22 in Bigelow's _France and the Confederate Navy_,\r\np. 126, and so came to be written into narratives of mediation\r\nproposals. Richardson, II, 345, gives the correct date.

In Chapter XIV the error of this will\r\nbe shown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\nThe finality of the British Cabinet decision in November, 1862, relative\r\nto proposals of mediation or intervention was not accepted at the moment\r\nthough time was to prove its permanence. The British press was full of\r\nsuggestions that the first trial might more gracefully come from France\r\nsince that country was presumed to be on more friendly terms with the\r\nUnited States[846]. Others, notably Slidell at Paris, held the same\r\nview, and on January 8, 1863, Slidell addressed a memorandum to Napoleon\r\nIII, asking separate recognition of the South. The next day, Napoleon\r\ndictated an instruction to Mercier offering friendly mediation in\r\ncourteous terms but with no hint of an armistice or of an intended\r\nrecognition of the South[847]. Meanwhile, Mercier had again approached\r\nLyons alleging that he had been urged by Greeley, editor of the _New\r\nYork Tribune_, to make an isolated French offer, but that he felt this\r\nwould be contrary to the close harmony hitherto maintained in\r\nFrench-British relations. But Mercier added that if Lyons was\r\ndisinclined to a proposal of mediation, he intended to advise his\r\nGovernment to give him authority to act alone[848]. Lyons made no\r\ncomment to Mercier but wrote to Russell, \"I certainly desire that the\r\nSettlement of the Contest should be made without the intervention\r\nof England.\"\r\n\r\nA week later the Russian Minister, Stoeckl, also came to Lyons desiring\r\nto discover what would be England's attitude if Russia should act alone,\r\nor perhaps with France, leaving England out of a proposal to the\r\nNorth[849]. This was based on the supposition that the North, weary of\r\nwar, might ask the good offices of Russia. Lyons replied that he did not\r\nthink that contingency near and otherwise evaded Stoeckl's questions;\r\nbut he was somewhat suspicious, concluding his report, \"I cannot quite\r\nforget that Monsieur Mercier and Monsieur de Stoeckl had agreed to go to\r\nRichmond together last Spring[850].\" The day after this despatch was\r\nwritten Mercier presented, February 3, the isolated French offer and on\r\nFebruary 6 received Seward's reply couched in argumentative, yet polite\r\nlanguage, but positively declining the proposal[851]. Evidently Lyons\r\nwas a bit disquieted by the incident; but in London, Napoleon's overture\r\nto America was officially stated to be unobjectionable, as indeed was\r\nrequired by the implications of the reply of November 13, to France.\r\nRussell, on February 14, answered Lyons' communications in a letter\r\nmarked \"Seen by Lord Palmerston and the Queen\":\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty's Government have no wish to interfere at\r\n     present in any way in the Civil War. If France were to offer\r\n     good offices or mediation, Her Majesty's Government would\r\n     feel no jealousy or repugnance to such a course on the part\r\n     of France alone[852].\"\r\n\r\nThe writing of this despatch antedated the knowledge that France had\r\nalready acted at Washington, and does not necessarily indicate any\r\ngovernmental feeling of a break in previous close relations with France\r\non the American question. Yet this was indubitably the case and became\r\nincreasingly evident as time passed. Russell's despatch to Lyons of\r\nFebruary 14 appears rather to be evidence of the effect of the debates\r\nin Parliament when its sessions were resumed on February 5, for in both\r\nLords and Commons there was given a hearty and nearly unanimous support\r\nof the Government's decision to make no overture for a cessation of the\r\nconflict in America. Derby clearly outlined the two possible conditions\r\nof mediation; first, when efforts by the North to subdue the South had\r\npractically ceased; and second, if humane interests required action by\r\nneutral states, in which case the intervening parties must be fully\r\nprepared to use force. Neither condition had arrived and strict\r\nneutrality was the wise course. Disraeli also approved strict neutrality\r\nbut caustically referred to Gladstone's Newcastle speech and sharply\r\nattacked the Cabinet's uncertain and changeable policy--merely a party\r\nspeech. Russell upheld the Government's decision but went out of his way\r\nto assert that the entire subjugation of the South would be a calamity\r\nto the United States itself, since it would require an unending use of\r\nforce to hold the South in submission[853]. Later, when news of the\r\nFrench offer at Washington had been received, the Government was\r\nattacked in the Lords by an undaunted friend of the South, Lord\r\nCampbell, on the ground of a British divergence from close relations\r\nwith France. Russell, in a brief reply, reasserted old arguments that\r\nthe time had \"not yet\" come, but now declared that events seemed to show\r\nthe possibility of a complete Northern victory and added with emphasis\r\nthat recognition of the South could justly be regarded by the North as\r\nan \"unfriendly act[854].\"\r\n\r\nThus Parliament and Cabinet were united against meddling in America,\r\nbasing this attitude on neutral duty and national interests, and with\r\nbarely a reference to the new policy of the North toward slavery,\r\ndeclared in the emancipation proclamations of September 22, 1862, and\r\nJanuary 1, 1863, Had these great documents then no favourable influence\r\non British opinion and action? Was the Northern determination to root\r\nout the institution of slavery, now clearly announced, of no effect in\r\nwinning the favour of a people and Government long committed to a world\r\npolicy against that institution? It is here necessary to review early\r\nBritish opinion, the facts preceding the first emancipation\r\nproclamation, and to examine its purpose in the mind of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of actual military operations, while there was still\r\nhope of some peaceful solution, British opinion had been with the North\r\non the alleged ground of sympathy with a free as against a slave-owning\r\nsociety. But war once begun the disturbance to British trade interests\r\nand Lincoln's repeated declarations that the North had no intention of\r\ndestroying slavery combined to offer an excuse and a reason for an\r\nalmost complete shift of British opinion. The abolitionists of the North\r\nand the extreme anti-slavery friends in England, relatively few in\r\nnumber in both countries, still sounded the note of \"slavery the cause\r\nof the war,\" but got little hearing. Nevertheless it was seen by\r\nthoughtful minds that slavery was certain to have a distinct bearing on\r\nthe position of Great Britain when the war was concluded. In May, 1861,\r\nPalmerston declared that it would be a happy day when \"we could succeed\r\nin putting an end to this unnatural war between the two sections of our\r\nNorth American cousins,\" but added that the difficulty for England was\r\nthat \"_We_ could not well mix ourselves up with the acknowledgment of\r\nslavery[855]....\"\r\n\r\nGreat Britain's long-asserted abhorrence of slavery caused, indeed, a\r\nperplexity in governmental attitude. But this looked to the final\r\noutcome of an independent South--an outcome long taken for granted.\r\nDebate on the existing moralities of the war very soon largely\r\ndisappeared from British discussion and in its place there cropped out,\r\nhere and there, expressions indicative of anxiety as to whether the war\r\ncould long continue without a \"servile insurrection,\" with all its\r\nattendant horrors.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 1861, the _Economist_, reviewing the progress of the war\r\npreparations to date, asserted that it was universally agreed no\r\nrestoration of the Union was possible and answered British fears by\r\ndeclaring it was impossible to believe that even the American madness\r\ncould contemplate a servile insurrection. The friendly _Spectator_ also\r\ndiscussed the matter and repeatedly. It was a mistaken idea, said this\r\njournal, that there could be no enfranchisement without a slave rising,\r\nbut should this occur, \"the right of the slave to regain his freedom,\r\neven if the effort involve slaughter, is as clear as any other\r\napplication of the right of self-defence[856].\" Yet English\r\nabolitionists should not urge the slave to act for himself, since \"as\r\nwar goes on and all compromise fails the American mind will harden under\r\nthe white heat and determine that the _cause_ of all conflict must\r\ncease.\" That slavery, in spite of any declaration by Lincoln or Northern\r\ndenial of a purpose to attack it--denials which disgusted Harriet\r\nMartineau--was in real fact the basic cause of the war, seemed to her as\r\nclear as anything in reason[857]. She had no patience with English\r\nanti-slavery people who believed Northern protestations, and she did\r\nnot express concern over the horrors of a possible servile insurrection.\r\nNevertheless this spectre was constantly appearing. Again the\r\n_Spectator_ sought to allay such fears; but yet again also proclaimed\r\nthat even such a contingency was less fearful than the consolidation of\r\nthe slave-power in the South[858].\r\n\r\nThus a servile insurrection was early and frequently an argument which\r\npro-Northern friends were compelled to meet. In truth the bulk of the\r\nBritish press was constant in holding up this bogie to its readers, even\r\ngoing to the point of weakening its argument of the impossibility of a\r\nNorthern conquest of the South by appealing to history to show that\r\nEngland in her two wars with America had had a comparatively easy time\r\nin the South, thus postulating the real danger of some \"negro Garibaldi\r\ncalling his countrymen to arms[859].\" Nor was this fear merely a\r\npretended one. It affected all classes and partisans of both sides. Even\r\nofficial England shared in it; January 20, 1862, Lyons wrote, \"The\r\nquestion is rapidly tending towards the issue either of peace and a\r\nrecognition of the separation, or a Proclamation of Emancipation and the\r\nraising of a servile insurrection[860].\" At nearly the same time\r\nRussell, returning to Gladstone a letter from Sumner to Cobden,\r\nexpressed his sorrow \"that the President intends a war of emancipation,\r\nmeaning thereby, I fear, a war of greater desolation than has been since\r\nthe revival of letters[861].\" John Stuart Mill, with that clear logic\r\nwhich appealed to the more intelligent reader, in an able examination of\r\nthe underlying causes and probable results of the American conflict,\r\nexcused the Northern leaders for early denial of a purpose to attack\r\nslavery, but expressed complete confidence that even these leaders by\r\nnow understood the \"almost certain results of success in the present\r\nconflict\" (the extinction of slavery) and prophesied that \"if the\r\nwriters who so severely criticize the present moderation of the\r\nFree-soilers are desirous to see the war become an abolition war, it is\r\nprobable that if the war lasts long enough they will be gratified[862].\"\r\nJohn Bright, reaching a wider public, in speech after speech, expressed\r\nfaith that the people of the North were \"marching on, as I believe, to\r\nits [slavery's] entire abolition[863].\"\r\n\r\nPro-Southern Englishmen pictured the horrors of an \"abolition war,\" and\r\nbelieved the picture true; strict neutrals, like Lyons, feared the same\r\ndevelopment; friends of the North pushed aside the thought of a \"negro\r\nterror,\" yet even while hoping and declaring that the war would destroy\r\nslavery, could not escape from apprehensions of an event that appeared\r\ninevitable. Everywhere, to the British mind, it seemed that emancipation\r\nwas necessarily a provocative to servile insurrection, and this belief\r\nlargely affected the reception of the emancipation proclamation--a fact\r\nalmost wholly lost sight of in historical writing.\r\n\r\nNor did the steps taken in America leading up to emancipation weaken\r\nthis belief--rather they appeared to justify it. The great advocate of\r\nabolition as a weapon in the war and for its own sake was Charles\r\nSumner, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He early\r\ntook the ground that a proclamation everywhere emancipating the slaves\r\nwould give to the Northern cause a moral support hitherto denied it in\r\nEurope and would at the same time strike a blow at Southern resistance.\r\nThis idea was presented in a public speech at Worcester, Massachusetts,\r\nin October, 1861, but even Sumner's free-soil friends thought him\r\nmistaken and his expressions \"unfortunate.\" By December, however, he\r\nfound at Washington a change in governmental temper and from that date\r\nSumner was constant, through frequent private conversations with\r\nLincoln, in pressing for action. These ideas and his personal activities\r\nfor their realization were well known to English friends, as in his\r\nletters to Cobden and Bright, and to the English public in general\r\nthrough Sumner's speeches, for Sumner had long been a well-known figure\r\nin the British press[864].\r\n\r\nLincoln, never an \"Abolitionist,\" in spite of his famous utterance in\r\nthe 'fifties that the United States could not indefinitely continue to\r\nexist \"half-slave and half-free,\" had, in 1861, disapproved and recalled\r\nthe orders of some of the military leaders, like Fremont, who without\r\nauthority had sought to extend emancipation to slaves within the lines\r\nof their command. But as early as anyone he had foreseen the gradual\r\nemergence of emancipation as a war problem, at first dangerous to that\r\nwise \"border state policy\" which had prevented the more northern of the\r\nslave states from seceding. His first duty was to restore the Union and\r\nto that he gave all his energy, yet that emancipation, when the time was\r\nripe, was also in Lincoln's mind is evident from the gradual approach\r\nthrough legislation and administrative act. In February, 1862, a Bill\r\nwas under discussion in Congress, called the \"Confiscation Bill,\" which,\r\namong other clauses, provided that all slaves of persons engaged in\r\nrebellion against the United States, who should by escape, or capture,\r\ncome into the possession of the military forces of the United States,\r\nshould be for ever free; but that this provision should not be operative\r\nuntil the expiration of sixty days, thus giving slave-owners opportunity\r\nto cease their rebellion and retain their slaves[865]. This measure did\r\nnot at first have Lincoln's approval for he feared its effect on the\r\nloyalists of the border states. Nevertheless he realized the growing\r\nstrength of anti-slavery sentiment in the war and fully sympathized with\r\nit where actual realization did not conflict with the one great object\r\nof his administration. Hence in March, 1862, he heartily concurred in a\r\nmeasure passed rapidly to Presidential approval, April 16, freeing the\r\nslaves in the District of Columbia, a territory where there was no\r\nquestion of the constitutional power of the national Government.\r\n\r\nFrom February, 1862, until the issue of the first emancipation\r\nproclamation in September, there was, in truth, a genuine conflict\r\nbetween Congress and President as to methods and extent of emancipation.\r\nCongress was in a mood to punish the South; Lincoln, looking steadily\r\ntoward re-union, yet realizing the rising strength of anti-slavery in\r\nthe North, advocated a gradual, voluntary, and compensated emancipation.\r\nNeither party spoke the word \"servile insurrection,\" yet both realized\r\nits possibility, and Seward, in foreign affairs, was quick to see and\r\nuse it as a threat. A brief summary of measures will indicate the\r\ncontest. March 6, Lincoln sent a message to Congress recommending that a\r\njoint resolution be passed pledging the pecuniary aid of the national\r\nGovernment to any state voluntarily emancipating its slaves, his avowed\r\npurpose being to secure early action by the loyal border states in the\r\nhope that this might influence the Southern states[866]. Neither the\r\nHouse of Representatives nor the Senate were really favourable to this\r\nresolution and the border states bitterly opposed it in debate, but it\r\npassed by substantial majorities in both branches and was approved by\r\nLincoln on April 10. In effect the extreme radical element in Congress\r\nhad yielded, momentarily, to the President's insistence on an\r\nolive-branch offering of compensated emancipation. Both as regards the\r\nborder states and looking to the restoration of the Union, Lincoln was\r\ndetermined to give this line of policy a trial. The prevailing\r\nsentiment of Congress, however, preferred the punitive Confiscation\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture General Hunter, in command of the \"Department of the\r\nSouth,\" which theoretically included also the States of South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia and Florida, issued an order declaring the slaves in these\r\nstates free. This was May 9, 1862. Lincoln immediately countermanded\r\nHunter's order, stating that such action \"under my responsibility, I\r\nreserve to myself[867].\" He renewed, in this same proclamation, earnest\r\nappeals to the border states, to embrace the opportunity offered by the\r\nCongressional resolution of April 10. In truth, border state attitude\r\nwas the test of the feasibility of Lincoln's hoped-for voluntary\r\nemancipation, but these states were unwilling to accept the plan.\r\nMeanwhile pressure was being exerted for action on the Confiscation\r\nBill; it was pushed through Congress and presented to Lincoln for his\r\nsignature or veto. He signed it on July 12, _but did not notify that\r\nfact to Congress until July 17._ On this same day of signature, July 12,\r\nLincoln sent to Congress a proposal of an Act to give pecuniary aid in\r\nvoluntary state emancipation and held a conference with the\r\ncongressional representatives of the border states seeking their\r\ndefinite approval of his policy. A minority agreed but the majority were\r\nemphatically against him. The Confiscation Bill would not affect the\r\nborder states; they were not in rebellion. And they did not desire to\r\nfree the slaves even if compensated[868].\r\n\r\nThus Lincoln, by the stubbornness of the border states, was forced\r\ntoward the Congressional point of view as expressed in the Confiscation\r\nBill. On the day following his failure to win the border state\r\nrepresentatives he told Seward and Welles who were driving with him,\r\nthat he had come to the conclusion that the time was near for the issue\r\nof a proclamation of emancipation as a military measure fully within the\r\ncompetence of the President. This was on July 13[869]. Seward offered a\r\nfew objections but apparently neither Cabinet official did more than\r\nlisten to Lincoln's argument of military necessity. Congress adjourned\r\non July 17. On July 22, the President read to the Cabinet a draft of an\r\nemancipation proclamation the text of the first paragraph of which\r\nreferred to the Confiscation Act and declared that this would be\r\nrigorously executed unless rebellious subjects returned to their\r\nallegiance. But the remainder of the draft reasserted the ideal of a\r\ngradual and compensated emancipation and concluded with the warning that\r\nfor states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, a general emancipation\r\nof slaves would be proclaimed[870]. All of the Cabinet approved except\r\nBlair who expressed fears of the effect on the approaching November\r\nelections, and Seward who, while professing sympathy with the indicated\r\npurpose, argued that the time was badly chosen in view of recent\r\nmilitary disasters and the approach of Lee's army toward Washington. The\r\nmeasure, Seward said, might \"be viewed as the last measure of an\r\nexhausted government, a cry for help; the government stretching forth\r\nits hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to\r\nthe government. It will be considered our last _shriek_ on the retreat.\"\r\nHe therefore urged postponement until after a Northern victory. This\r\nappealed to Lincoln and he \"put the draft of the proclamation aside,\r\nwaiting for victory[871].\"\r\n\r\nVictory came in September, with McClellan's defeat of Lee at Antietam,\r\nand the retreat of the Southern army toward Richmond. Five days later,\r\nSeptember 22, Lincoln issued the proclamation, expanded and altered in\r\ntext from the draft of July 22, but in substance the same[872]. The\r\nloyal border states were not to be affected, but the proclamation\r\nrenewed the promise of steps to be taken to persuade them to voluntary\r\naction. On January 1, 1863, a second proclamation, referring to that of\r\nSeptember 22, was issued by Lincoln \"by virtue of the power in me vested\r\nas commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States in time\r\nof actual armed rebellion against the authority and Government of the\r\nUnited States....\" The states affected were designated by name and all\r\npersons held as slaves within them \"are, and henceforward shall be,\r\nfree....\" \"I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to\r\nabstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence....\" \"And\r\nupon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by\r\nthe Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate\r\njudgment of mankind, and the gracious favour of Almighty God[873].\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the steps, from December, 1861, when the radical Sumner began\r\nhis pressure for action, to September, 1862, when Lincoln's pledge of\r\nemancipation was made. Did these steps indicate, as British opinion\r\nunquestionably held, an intention to rouse a servile insurrection? Was\r\nthe Confiscation Bill passed with that purpose in view and had Lincoln\r\ndecided to carry it into effect? The failure of the slaves to rise is,\r\nindeed, the great marvel of the Civil War and was so regarded not in\r\nEngland only, but in America also. It was the expectation of the North\r\nand the constant fear of the South. But was this, in truth, the\r\n_purpose_ of the emancipation proclamation?\r\n\r\nThis purpose has been somewhat summarily treated by American\r\nhistorians, largely because of lack of specific evidence as to motives\r\nat the time of issue. Two words \"military necessity\" are made to cover\r\nnearly the entire argument for emancipation in September, 1862, but in\r\njust what manner the military prowess of the North was to be increased\r\nwas not at first indicated. In 1864, Lincoln declared that after the\r\nfailure of successive efforts to persuade the border states to accept\r\ncompensated emancipation he had believed there had arrived the\r\n\"indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the\r\nblacks[874].\" Repeatedly in later defence of the proclamation he urged\r\nthe benefits that had come from his act and asserted that commanders in\r\nthe field \"believe the emancipation policy and the use of coloured\r\ntroops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion[875].\" He\r\nadded: \"negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do\r\nanything for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their\r\nlives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive, even the\r\npromise of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no note here of stirring a servile insurrection; nor did\r\nLincoln ever acknowledge that such a purpose had been in his mind,\r\nthough the thought of such possible result must have been present--was,\r\nindeed, present to most minds even without a proclamation of\r\nemancipation. Lincoln's alleged purpose was simply to draw away slaves,\r\nwherever possible, from their rebellious masters, thus reducing the\r\neconomic powers of resistance of the South, and then to make these\r\nex-slaves directly useful in winning the war. But after the war, even\r\nhere and there during it, a theory was advanced that an impelling motive\r\nwith the President had been the hope of influencing favourably foreign\r\ngovernments and peoples by stamping the Northern cause with a high moral\r\npurpose. In popular opinion, Lincoln came to be regarded as a\r\nfar-visioned statesman in anticipating that which ultimately came to\r\npass. This has important bearing on the relations of the United States\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that nearly every Northern American had believed in\r\n1860, that anti-slavery England would sympathize strongly with the\r\nNorth. The event did not prove this to be the case, nor could the North\r\njustly complain in the face of administration denials of an anti-slavery\r\npurpose. The English Government therefore was widely upheld by British\r\nopinion in regarding the struggle from the point of view of British\r\ninterests. Yet any Northern step antagonistic to the institution of\r\nslavery compelled British governmental consideration. As early as\r\nDecember, 1860, before the war began, Bunch, at Charleston, had reported\r\na conversation with Rhett, in which the latter frankly declared that the\r\nSouth would expect to revive the African Slave Trade[876]. This was\r\nlimited in the constitution later adopted by the Confederacy which in\r\nsubstance left the matter to the individual states--a condition that\r\nSouthern agents in England found it hard to explain[877]. As already\r\nnoted, the ardent friends of the North continued to insist, even after\r\nLincoln's denial, that slavery was the real cause of the American\r\nrupture[878]. By September, 1861, John Bright was writing to his friend\r\nSumner that, all indications to the contrary, England would warmly\r\nsupport the North if only it could be shown that emancipation was an\r\nobject[879]. Again and again he urged, it is interesting to note, just\r\nthose ideals of gradual and compensated emancipation which were so\r\nstrongly held by Lincoln. In this same month the _Spectator_ thought it\r\nwas \"idle to strive to ignore the very centre and spring of all\r\ndisunion,\" and advised a \"prudent audacity in striking at the cause\r\nrather than at the effect[880].\" Three weeks later the _Spectator_,\r\nreviewing general British press comments, summed them up as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"If you make it a war of emancipation we shall think you\r\n     madmen, and tell you so, though the ignorant instincts of\r\n     Englishmen will support you. And if you follow our counsel in\r\n     holding a tight rein on the Abolitionists, we shall applaud\r\n     your worldly wisdom so far; but shall deem it our duty to set\r\n     forth continually that you have forfeited all claim to the\r\n     _popular_ sympathy of England.\"\r\n\r\nThis, said the _Spectator_, had been stated in the most objectionable\r\nstyle by the _Times_ in particular, which, editorially, had alleged that\r\n\"the North has now lost the chance of establishing a high moral\r\nsuperiority by a declaration against slavery.\" To all this the\r\n_Spectator_ declared that the North must adopt the bold course and make\r\nclear that restoration of the Union was not intended with the old canker\r\nat its roots[881].\r\n\r\nOfficial England held a different view. Russell believed that the\r\nseparation of North and South would conduce to the extinction of slavery\r\nsince the South, left to itself and fronted by a great and prosperous\r\nfree North, with a population united in ideals, would be forced,\r\nultimately, to abandon its \"special system.\" He professed that he could\r\nnot understand Mrs. Stowe's support of the war and thought she and\r\nSumner \"animated by a spirit of vengeance[882].\" If the South did yield\r\nand the Union were restored _with_ slavery, Russell thought that\r\n\"Slavery would prevail all over the New World. For that reason I wish\r\nfor separation[883].\" These views were repeated frequently by Russell.\r\nHe long had a fixed idea on the moral value of separation, but was\r\ncareful to state, \"I give you these views merely as speculations,\" and\r\nit is worthy of note that after midsummer of 1862 he rarely indulged in\r\nthem. Against such speculations, whether by Russell or by others, Mill\r\nprotested in his famous article in _Fraser's_, February, 1862[884].\r\n\r\nOn one aspect of slavery the North was free to act and early did so.\r\nSeward proposed to Lyons a treaty giving mutual right of search off the\r\nAfrican Coast and on the coasts of Cuba for the suppression of the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade. Such a treaty had long been urged by Great Britain\r\nbut persistently refused by the United States. It could not well be\r\ndeclined now by the British Government and was signed by Seward, April\r\n8, 1862[885], but if he expected any change in British attitude as a\r\nresult he was disappointed. The renewal by the South of that trade might\r\nbe a barrier to British goodwill, but the action of the North was viewed\r\nas but a weak attempt to secure British sympathy, and to mark the limits\r\nof Northern anti-slavery efforts. Indeed, the Government was not eager\r\nfor the treaty on other grounds, since the Admiralty had never \"felt any\r\ninterest in the suppression of the slave trade ... whatever they have\r\ndone ... they have done grudgingly and imperfectly[886].\"\r\n\r\nThis was written at the exact period when Palmerston and Russell were\r\ninitiating those steps which were to result in the Cabinet crisis on\r\nmediation in October-November, 1862. Certainly the Slave Trade treaty\r\nwith America had not influenced governmental attitude. At this juncture\r\nthere was founded, November, 1862, the London Emancipation Society, with\r\nthe avowed object of stirring anti-slavery Englishmen in protest against\r\n\"favouring the South.\" But George Thompson, its organizer, had been\r\nengaged in the preliminary work of organization for some months and the\r\nSociety is therefore to be regarded as an expression of that small group\r\nwho were persistent and determined in assertion of slavery as the cause\r\nand object of the Civil War, before the issue of Lincoln's\r\nproclamation[887]. Thus for England as a whole and for official England\r\nthe declarations of these few voices were regarded as expressive of a\r\nwish rather than as consistent with the facts. The moral uplift of an\r\nanti-slavery object was denied to the North.\r\n\r\nThis being so did Lincoln seek to correct the foreign view by the\r\nemancipation proclamation? There is some, but scant ground for so\r\nbelieving. It is true that this aspect had at various times, though\r\nrarely, been presented to the President. Carl Schurz, American Minister\r\nat Madrid, wrote to Seward as early as September 14, 1861, strongly\r\nurging the declaration of an anti-slavery purpose in the war and\r\nasserting that public opinion in Europe would then be such in favour of\r\nthe North that no government would \"dare to place itself, by declaration\r\nor act, upon the side of a universally condemned institution[888].\"\r\nThere is no evidence that Seward showed this despatch to Lincoln, but in\r\nJanuary, 1862, Schurz returned to America and in conversation with the\r\nPresident urged the \"moral issue\" to prevent foreign intervention. The\r\nPresident replied: \"You may be right. Probably you are. I have been\r\nthinking so myself. I cannot imagine that any European power would dare\r\nto recognize and aid the Southern Confederacy if it became clear that\r\nthe Confederacy stands for slavery and the Union for freedom[889].\" No\r\ndoubt others urged upon him the same view. Indeed, one sincere foreign\r\nfriend, Count Gasparin, who had early written in favour of the\r\nNorth[890], and whose opinions were widely read, produced a second work\r\nin the spring of 1862, in which the main theme was \"slavery the issue.\"\r\nThe author believed emancipation inevitable and urged an instant\r\nproclamation of Northern _intention_ to free the slaves[891].\r\nPresumably, Lincoln was familiar with this work. Meanwhile Sumner\r\npressed the same idea though adding the prevalent abolition arguments\r\nwhich did not, necessarily, involve thought of foreign effect. On the\r\ngeneral question of emancipation Lincoln listened, even telling Sumner\r\nthat he \"was ahead of himself only a month or six weeks[892].\"\r\n\r\nYet after the enactment of the \"confiscation bill\" in July, 1862, when\r\nstrong abolitionist pressure was brought on the President to issue a\r\ngeneral proclamation of emancipation, he reasserted in the famous reply\r\nto Greeley, August 22, 1862, his one single purpose to restore the Union\r\n\"with or without slavery.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they\r\n     could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree\r\n     with them.\r\n\r\n     \"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they\r\n     could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree\r\n     with them.\r\n\r\n     \"_My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to\r\n     save or to destroy slavery_[893].\"\r\n\r\nHere seemed to be specific denial of raising a moral issue; yet unknown\r\nto the public at the moment there had already been drafted and discussed\r\nin Cabinet the emancipation proclamation. Greeley had presented\r\nabolitionist demands essential to cement the North. A month later,\r\nSeptember 13, a delegation of Chicago clergymen came to Washington, had\r\nan audience with Lincoln, presented similar arguments, but also laid\r\nstress on the necessity of securing the sympathy of Europe. This was but\r\nnine days before the first proclamation was issued, but Lincoln replied\r\nmuch as to Greeley, though he stated, \"I will also concede that\r\nEmancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are\r\nincited by something more than ambition[894].\" Immediately after the\r\nevent, September 24, making a short speech to a serenading party,\r\nLincoln said, \"I can only trust in God I have made no mistake.... It is\r\nnow for the country and the world to pass judgment and, maybe, take\r\naction upon it[895].\" Over a year later, December 8, 1863, in his annual\r\nmessage to Congress, he noted a \"much improved\" tone in foreign\r\ncountries as resulting from the emancipation proclamation, but dwelt\r\nmainly on the beneficial effects at home[896].\r\n\r\nEvidently there is slight ground for believing Lincoln to have been\r\nconvinced that foreign relations would be improved by the proclamation.\r\nOn the contrary, if he trusted Seward's judgment he may have _feared_\r\nthe effect on Europe, for such was Seward's prophecy. Here may have lain\r\nthe true meaning of Lincoln's speech of September 24--that it was now\r\nfor \"the world to pass judgment and, maybe, take action upon it.\" After\r\nall foreign policy, though its main lines were subject to the\r\nPresident's control, was in the hands of Seward and throughout this\r\nentire period of six months since the introduction of the Confiscation\r\nBill up to Lincoln's presentation of his draft proclamation to the\r\nCabinet in July, Seward had been using the threat of a servile\r\ninsurrection as a deterrent upon French-British talk of intervention. At\r\ntimes Seward connected servile insurrection with emancipation--at\r\ntimes not.\r\n\r\nSeward had begun his career as Secretary of State with an appeal to\r\nEurope on lines of old friendship and had implied, though he could not\r\nstate explicitly, the \"noble\" cause of the North. He had been met with\r\nwhat he considered a \"cold\" and premature as well as unjustifiable\r\ndeclaration of neutrality. From the first day of the conflict Lyons and\r\nMercier had been constant in representing the hardships inflicted by the\r\nAmerican war upon the economic interests of their respective countries.\r\nBoth men bore down upon the interruption of the cotton trade and Seward\r\nkept repeating that Northern victories would soon release the raw\r\ncotton. He expected and promised much from the capture of New Orleans,\r\nbut the results were disappointing. As time went on Seward became\r\nconvinced that material interests alone would determine the attitude and\r\naction of Great Britain and France. But the stored supplies were on hand\r\nin the South, locked in by the blockade and would be available when the\r\nwar was over _provided_ the war did not take on an uncivilized and\r\nsanguinary character through a rising of the slaves. If that occurred\r\ncotton would be burned and destroyed and cotton supply to Europe would\r\nbe not merely a matter of temporary interruption, but one of\r\nlong-continued dearth with no certainty of early resumption. Fearing the\r\ngrowth in England, especially, of an intention to intervene, Seward\r\nthreatened a Northern appeal to the slaves, thinking of the threat not\r\nso much in terms of an uncivilized and horrible war as in terms of the\r\nmaterial interests of Great Britain. In brief, considering foreign\r\nattitude and action in its relation to Northern advantage--to the\r\nwinning of the war--he would use emancipation as a threat of servile\r\ninsurrection, but did not desire emancipation itself for fear it would\r\ncause that very intervention which it was his object to prevent.\r\n\r\nHis instructions are wholly in line with this policy. In February, 1862,\r\nthe Confiscation Bill had been introduced in Congress. In April,\r\nMercier's trip to Richmond[897] had caused much speculation and started\r\nmany rumours in London of plans of mediation[898]. On May 28, Seward\r\nwrote to Adams at great length and especially emphasized two points:\r\nfirst that while diplomats abroad had hitherto been interdicted from\r\ndiscussing slavery as an issue in the war, they were now authorized to\r\nstate that the war was, in part at least, intended for the suppression\r\nof slavery, and secondly, that the North if interfered with by foreign\r\nnations would be forced to have recourse to a servile war. Such a war,\r\nSeward argued, would be \"completely destructive of all European\r\ninterests[899]....\" A copy of this instruction Adams gave to Russell on\r\nJune 20. Eight days later Adams told Cobden in reply to a query about\r\nmediation that it would result in a servile war[900]. Evidently Adams\r\nperfectly understood Seward's policy.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, Lincoln told Seward and Welles of the planned emancipation\r\nproclamation and that this was his first mention of it to anyone. Seward\r\ncommented favourably but wished to consider the proposal in all its\r\nbearings before committing himself[901]. The day following he\r\ntransmitted to agents abroad a copy of the Bill that day introduced into\r\nCongress embodying Lincoln's plan for gradual and compensated\r\nemancipation. This was prompt transmittal--and was unusual. Seward sent\r\nthe Bill without material comment[902], but it is apparent that this\r\nmethod and measure of emancipation would much better fit in with his\r\ntheory of the slavery question in relation to foreign powers, than would\r\nan outright proclamation of emancipation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile American anxiety as to a possible alteration in British\r\nneutral policy was increasing. July 11, Adams reported that he had\r\nlearned \"from a credible source\" that the British Cabinet might soon\r\n\"take new ground[903].\" This despatch if it reached Seward previous to\r\nthe Cabinet of July 22, presumably added strength to his conviction of\r\nthe inadvisability of now issuing the proclamation. In that Cabinet,\r\nSeward in fact went much beyond the customary historical statement that\r\nhe advised postponement of the proclamation until the occurrence of a\r\nNorthern victory; he argued, according to Secretary of War Stanton's\r\nnotes of the meeting, \"That foreign nations will intervene to prevent\r\nthe abolition of slavery for the sake of cotton.... We break up our\r\nrelations with foreign nations and the production of cotton for sixty\r\nyears[904].\" These views did not prevail; Lincoln merely postponed\r\naction. Ten days later Seward sent that long instruction to Adams\r\ncovering the whole ground of feared European intervention, which,\r\nfortunately, Adams was never called upon to carry out[905]. In it there\r\nwas renewed the threat of a servile war if Europe attempted to aid the\r\nSouth, and again it is the materialistic view that is emphasized. Seward\r\nwas clinging to his theory of correct policy.\r\n\r\nNor was he mistaken in his view of first reactions in governmental\r\ncircles abroad--at least in England. On July 21, the day before\r\nLincoln's proposal of emancipation in the Cabinet, Stuart in reviewing\r\nmilitary prospects wrote: \"Amongst the means relied upon for weakening\r\nthe South is included a servile war[906].\" To this Russell replied: \"...\r\nI have to observe that the prospect of a servile war will only make\r\nother nations more desirous to see an end of this desolating and\r\ndestructive conflict[907].\" This was but brief reiteration of a more\r\nexact statement by Russell made in comment on Seward's first hint of\r\nservile war in his despatch to Adams of May 28, a copy of which had been\r\ngiven to Russell on June 20. On July 28, Russell reviewing Seward's\r\narguments, commented on the fast increasing bitterness of the American\r\nconflict, disturbing and unsettling to European Governments, and wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The approach of a servile war, so much insisted upon by Mr.\r\n     Seward in his despatch, only forewarns us that another\r\n     element of destruction may be added to the slaughter, loss of\r\n     property, and waste of industry, which already afflict a\r\n     country so lately prosperous and tranquil[908].\"\r\n\r\nIn this same despatch unfavourable comment was made also on the\r\nConfiscation Bill with its punitive emancipation clauses. Stuart\r\npresented a copy of the despatch to Seward on August 16[909]. On August\r\n22, Stuart learned of Lincoln's plan and reported it as purely a\r\nmanoeuvre to affect home politics and to frighten foreign\r\ngovernments[910]. Where did Stuart get the news if not from Seward,\r\nsince he also reported the latter's success in postponing the\r\nproclamation?\r\n\r\nIn brief both Seward and Russell were regarding emancipation in the\r\nlight of an incitement to servile insurrection, and both believed such\r\nan event would add to the argument for foreign intervention. The\r\n_threat_ Seward had regarded as useful; the _event_ would be highly\r\ndangerous to the North. Not so, however, did emancipation appear in\r\nprospect to American diplomats abroad. Adams was a faithful servant in\r\nattempting to carry out the ideas and plans of his chief, but as early\r\nas February, 1862, he had urged a Northern declaration in regard to\r\nslavery in order to meet in England Southern private representations\r\nthat, independence won, the South would enter upon a plan of gradual\r\nemancipation to be applied \"to all persons born after some specific\r\ndate[911].\" Motley, at Vienna, frequently after February, 1862, in\r\nprivate letters to his friends in America, urged some forward step on\r\nslavery[912], but no such advice in despatches found its way into the\r\nselected correspondence annually sent to print by Seward. Far more\r\nimportant was the determination taken by Adams, less than a month after\r\nhe had presented to Russell the \"servile war\" threat policy of Seward,\r\nto give advice to his chief that the chances of foreign intervention\r\nwould be best met by the distinct avowal of an anti-slavery object in\r\nthe war and that the North should be prepared to meet an European offer\r\nof mediation by declaring that if made to extinguish slavery such\r\nmediation would be welcome. This Adams thought would probably put an end\r\nto the mediation itself, but it would also greatly strengthen the\r\nNorthern position abroad[913].\r\n\r\nThis was no prevision of an emancipation proclamation; but it was\r\nassertion of the value of a higher \"moral issue.\" Meanwhile, on July 24,\r\nSeward still fearful of the effects abroad of emancipation, wrote to\r\nMotley, asking whether he was \"sure\" that European powers would not be\r\nencouraged in interference, because of material interests, by a Northern\r\nattempt to free the slaves[914]. Motley's answer began, \"A thousand\r\ntimes No,\" and Adams repeated his plea for a moral issue[915]. September\r\n25, Adams met Seward's \"material interests\" argument by declaring that\r\nfor Great Britain the chief difficulty in the cotton situation was not\r\nscarcity, but uncertainty, and that if English manufacturers could but\r\nknow what to expect there would be little \"cotton pressure\" on the\r\nGovernment[916]. Thus leading diplomats abroad did not agree with\r\nSeward, but the later advices of Adams were not yet received when the\r\nday, September 22, arrived on which Lincoln issued the proclamation. On\r\nthat day in sending the text to Adams the comment of Seward was brief.\r\nThe proclamation, he said, put into effect a policy the approach of\r\nwhich he had \"heretofore indicated to our representatives abroad,\" and\r\nhe laid emphasis on the idea that the main purpose of the proclamation\r\nwas to convince the South that its true interests were in the\r\npreservation of the Union--which is to say that the hoped-for result was\r\nthe return of the South _with its slaves_[917]. Certainly this was far\r\nfrom a truthful representation, but its purpose is evident. Seward's\r\nfirst thought was that having held up the threat of servile insurrection\r\nhe must now remove that bogie. Four days later his judgment was\r\nimproved, for he began, and thereafter maintained with vigour, the \"high\r\nmoral purpose\" argument as evinced in the emancipation proclamation.\r\n\"The interests of humanity,\" he wrote to Adams, \"have now become\r\nidentified with the cause of our country[918]....\"\r\n\r\nThat the material interests of Great Britain were still in Seward's\r\nthought is shown by the celerity with which under Lincoln's orders he\r\ngrasped at an unexpected opening in relation to liberated slaves. Stuart\r\nwrote in mid-September that Mr. Walker, secretary of the colony of\r\nBritish Guiana, was coming from Demerara to Washington to secure\r\nadditional labour for the British colony by offering to carry away\r\nex-slaves[919]. This scheme was no secret and five days after the issue\r\nof the proclamation Seward proposed to Stuart a convention by which the\r\nBritish Government would be permitted to transport to the West Indies,\r\nor to any of its colonies, the negroes about to be emancipated. On\r\nSeptember 30, Adams was instructed to take up the matter at London[920].\r\nRussell was at first disinclined to consider such a convention and\r\ndiscussion dragged until the spring of 1864, when it was again proposed,\r\nthis time by Russell, but now declined by Seward. In its immediate\r\ninfluence in the fall of 1862, Seward's offer had no effect on the\r\nattitude of the British Government[921].\r\n\r\nTo Englishmen and Americans alike it has been in later years a matter\r\nfor astonishment that the emancipation proclamation did not at once\r\nconvince Great Britain of the high purposes of the North. But if it be\r\nremembered that in the North itself the proclamation was greeted, save\r\nby a small abolitionist faction, with doubt extending even to bitter\r\nopposition and that British governmental and public opinion had long\r\ndreaded a servile insurrection--even of late taking its cue from\r\nSeward's own prophecies--the cool reception given by the Government, the\r\nvehement and vituperative explosions of the press do not seem so\r\nsurprising. \"This Emancipation Proclamation,\" wrote Stuart on September\r\n23, \"seems a brutum fulmen[922].\" One of the President's motives, he\r\nthought, was to affect public opinion in England. \"But there is no\r\npretext of humanity about the Proclamation.... It is merely a\r\nConfiscation Act, or perhaps worse, for it offers direct encouragement\r\nto servile insurrections[923].\" Received in England during the Cabinet\r\nstruggle over mediation the proclamation appears not to have affected\r\nthat controversy, though Russell sought to use it as an argument for\r\nBritish action. In his memorandum, circulated October 13, Russell strove\r\nto show that the purpose and result would be servile war. He dwelt both\r\non the horrors of such a war, and on its destruction of industry:\r\n\r\n     \"What will be the practical effect of declaring emancipation,\r\n     not as an act of justice and beneficence, dispensed by the\r\n     Supreme Power of the State, but as an act of punishment and\r\n     retaliation inflicted by a belligerent upon a hostile\r\n     community, it is not difficult to foresee. Wherever the arms\r\n     of the United States penetrate, a premium will be given to\r\n     acts of plunder, of incendiarism, and of revenge. The\r\n     military and naval authorities of the United States will be\r\n     bound by their orders to maintain and protect the\r\n     perpetrators of such acts. Wherever the invasion of the\r\n     Southern States is crowned by victory, society will be\r\n     disorganized, industry suspended, large and small proprietors\r\n     of land alike reduced to beggary[924].\"\r\n\r\nThe London newspaper press was very nearly a unit in treating the\r\nproclamation with derision and contempt and no other one situation in\r\nthe Civil War came in for such vigorous denunciation. Citations setting\r\nforth such comment have frequently been gathered together illustrative\r\nof the extent of press condemnation and of its unity in vicious\r\neditorials[925]. There is no need to repeat many of them here, but a few\r\nwill indicate their tone. The _Times_ greeted the news with an assertion\r\nthat this was a final desperate play by Lincoln, as hope of victory\r\nwaned. It was his \"last card[926],\" a phrase that caught the fancy of\r\nlesser papers and was repeated by them. October 21, appeared the\r\n\"strongest\" of the _Times_ editorials:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABE LINCOLN'S LAST CARD; OR, ROUGE-ET-NOIR. _Reproduced\r\nby permission of the Proprietors of \"Punch\"_]\r\n\r\n     \"... We have here the history of the beginning of the end,\r\n     but who can tell how the pages will be written which are yet\r\n     to be filled before the inevitable separation is\r\n     accomplished? Are scenes like those which we a short time\r\n     since described from Dahomey yet to interpose, and is the\r\n     reign of the last PRESIDENT to go out amid horrible massacres\r\n     of white women and children, to be followed by the\r\n     extermination of the black race in the South? Is LINCOLN yet\r\n     a name not known to us as it will be known to posterity, and\r\n     is it ultimately to be classed among that catalogue of\r\n     monsters, the wholesale assassins and butchers of their kind?\r\n\r\n     \"... We will attempt at present to predict nothing as to\r\n     what the consequence of Mr. Lincoln's new policy may be,\r\n     except that it certainly will not have the effect of\r\n     restoring the Union. It will not deprive Mr. Lincoln of the\r\n     distinctive affix which he will share with many, for the most\r\n     part foolish and incompetent, Kings and Emperors, Caliphs and\r\n     Doges, that of being LINCOLN--'the Last.'\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ led the way; other papers followed on. The _Liverpool Post_\r\nthought a slave rising inevitable[927], as did also nearly every paper\r\nacknowledging anti-Northern sentiments, or professedly neutral, while\r\neven pro-Northern journals at first feared the same results[928].\r\nAnother striking phrase, \"Brutum Fulmen,\" ran through many editorials.\r\nThe _Edinburgh Review_ talked of Lincoln's \"cry of despair[929],\" which\r\nwas little different from Seward's feared \"last shriek.\" _Blackwood's_\r\nthought the proclamation \"monstrous, reckless, devilish.\" It \"justifies\r\nthe South in raising the black flag, and proclaiming a war without\r\nquarter[930].\" But there is no need to expand the citation of the\r\nwell-nigh universal British press pouring out of the wrath of heaven\r\nupon Lincoln, and his emancipation proclamation[931].\r\n\r\nEven though there can be no doubt that the bulk of England at first\r\nexpected servile war to follow the proclamation it is apparent that here\r\nand there a part of this British wrath was due to a fear that, in spite\r\nof denials of such influence, the proclamation was intended to arouse\r\npublic opinion against projects of intervention and _might so arouse\r\nit_. The New York correspondent of the _Times_ wrote that it was\r\n\"promulgated evidently as a sop to keep England and France quiet[932],\"\r\nand on October 9, an editorial asserted that Lincoln had \"a very\r\nimportant object. There is a presentiment in the North that recognition\r\ncannot be delayed, and this proclamation is aimed, not at the negro or\r\nthe South, but at Europe.\" _Bell's Weekly Messenger_ believed that it\r\nwas now \"the imperative duty of England and France to do what they can\r\nin order to prevent the possible occurrence of a crime which, if carried\r\nout, would surpass in atrocity any similar horror the world has ever\r\nseen[933].\" \"Historicus,\" on the other hand, asked: \"What is that\r\nsolution of the negro question to which an English Government is\r\nprepared to affix the seal of English approbation[934]?\" Mason, the\r\nConfederate Agent in London, wrote home that it was generally believed\r\nthe proclamation was issued \"as the means of warding off recognition....\r\nIt was seen through at once and condemned accordingly[935].\"\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of Northern purpose in no sense negatives the dictum\r\nthat the proclamation exercised little influence on immediate British\r\ngovernmental policy, but does offer some ground for the belief that\r\nstrong pro-Southern sympathizers at once saw the need of combating an\r\nargument dangerous to the carrying out of projects of mediation. Yet the\r\nnew \"moral purpose\" of Lincoln did not immediately appeal even to his\r\nfriends. The _Spectator_ deplored the lack of a clean-cut declaration in\r\nfavour of the principle of human freedom: \"The principle asserted is\r\nnot that a human being cannot justly own another, but that he cannot own\r\nhim unless he is loyal to the United States.\" ... \"There is no morality\r\nwhatever in such a decree, and if approved at all it must be upon its\r\nmerits as a political measure[936].\" Two weeks later, reporting a public\r\nspeech at Liverpool by ex-governor Morehead of Kentucky, in which\r\nLincoln was accused of treachery to the border states, the _Spectator_,\r\nwhile taking issue with the speaker's statements, commented that it was\r\nnot to be understood as fully defending a system of government which\r\nchose its executive \"from the ranks of half-educated mechanics[937].\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly in America the emancipation proclamation, though loudly\r\napplauded by the abolitionists, was received with misgivings. Lincoln\r\nwas disappointed at the public reaction and became very despondent,\r\nthough this was due, in part, to the failure of McClellan to follow up\r\nthe victory of Antietam. The elections of October and November went\r\nheavily against the administration and largely on the alleged ground of\r\nthe President's surrender to the radicals[938]. The army as a whole was\r\nnot favourably stirred by the proclamation; it was considered at best as\r\nbut a useless bit of \"waste paper[939].\" In England, John Bright, the\r\nmost ardent public advocate of the Northern cause, was slow to applaud\r\nheartily; not until December did he give distinct approval, and even\r\nthen in but half-hearted fashion, though he thought public interest was\r\nmuch aroused and that attention was now fixed on January 1, the date set\r\nby Lincoln for actual enforcement of emancipation[940]. In a speech at\r\nBirmingham, December 18, Bright had little to say of emancipation;\r\nrather he continued to use previous arguments against the South for\r\nadmitting, as Vice-President Stephens had declared, that slavery was the\r\nvery \"corner-stone\" of Southern institutions and society[941]. A few\r\npublic meetings at points where favour to the North had been shown were\r\ntried in October and November with some success but with no great show\r\nof enthusiasm. It was not until late December that the wind of public\r\nopinion, finding that no faintest slave-rising had been created by the\r\nproclamation began to veer in favour of the emancipation edict[942]. By\r\nthe end of the year it appeared that the Press, in holding up horrified\r\nhands and prophesying a servile war had \"overshot the mark[943].\"\r\n\r\nSoon the changing wind became a gale of public favour for the cause of\r\nemancipation, nor was this lessened--rather increased--by Jefferson\r\nDavis' proclamation of December 23, 1862, in which he declared that\r\nLincoln had approved \"of the effort to excite a servile insurrection,\"\r\nand that therefore it was now ordered \"all negro slaves captured in arms\r\nbe at once delivered over to the executive authorities of the respective\r\nStates to which they belong, to be dealt with according to the laws of\r\nsaid State.\" This by state laws meant death to the slave fighting for\r\nhis freedom, even as a regular soldier in the Northern armies, and gave\r\na good handle for accusations of Southern ferocity[944].\r\n\r\nOfficial opinion was not readily altered, Lyons writing in December that\r\nthe promised January proclamation might still mean servile war. He hoped\r\nthat neither Lincoln's proclamation nor Davis' threat of retaliation\r\nwould be carried into effect[945]. Russell regarded the January 1\r\nproclamation as \"a measure of war of a very questionable kind[946].\"\r\n\r\nBut the British anti-slavery public, now recovered from its fears of an\r\n\"abolition war\" was of another temper. Beginning with the last week of\r\nDecember, 1862, and increasing in volume in each succeeding month, there\r\ntook place meeting after meeting at which strong resolutions were passed\r\nenthusiastically endorsing the issue of the emancipation proclamation\r\nand pledging sympathy to the cause of the North. The _Liberator_ from\r\nweek to week, listed and commented on these public meetings, noting\r\nfifty-six held between December 30, 1862, and March 20, 1863. The\r\nAmerican Minister reported even more, many of which sent to him engraved\r\nresolutions or presented them in person through selected delegations.\r\nThe resolutions were much of the type of that adopted at Sheffield,\r\nJanuary 10:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_: that this meeting being convinced that slavery\r\n     is the cause of the tremendous struggle now going on in the\r\n     American States, and that the object of the leaders of the\r\n     rebellion is the perpetuation of the unchristian and inhuman\r\n     system of chattel slavery, earnestly prays that the rebellion\r\n     may be crushed, and its wicked object defeated, and that the\r\n     Federal Government may be strengthened to pursue its\r\n     emancipation policy till not a slave be left on the American\r\n     soil[947].\"\r\n\r\nAdams quoted the _Times_ as referring to these meetings as made up of\r\n\"nobodies.\" Adams commented:\r\n\r\n     \"They do not indeed belong to the high and noble class, but\r\n     they are just those nobodies who formerly forced their most\r\n     exalted countrymen to denounce the prosecution of the Slave\r\n     Trade by the commercial adventurers at Liverpool and Bristol,\r\n     and who at a later period overcame all their resistance to\r\n     the complete emancipation of the negro slaves in the British\r\n     dependencies. If they become once fully aroused to a sense of\r\n     the importance of this struggle as a purely moral question, I\r\n     feel safe in saying there will be an end of all effective\r\n     sympathy in Great Britain with the rebellion[948].\"\r\n\r\nAdams had no doubt \"that these manifestations are the genuine expression\r\nof the feelings of the religious dissenting and of the working classes,\"\r\nand was confident the Government would be much influenced by them[949].\r\nThe newspapers, though still editorially unfavourable to the\r\nemancipation proclamation, accepted and printed communications with\r\nincreasing frequency in which were expressed the same ideas as in the\r\npublic meetings. This was even more noticeable in the provincial press.\r\nSamuel A. Goddard, a merchant of Birmingham, was a prolific letter\r\nwriter to the _Birmingham Post_, consistently upholding the Northern\r\ncause and he now reiterated the phrase, \"Mr. Lincoln's cause is just and\r\nholy[950].\" In answer to Southern sneers at the failure of the\r\nproclamation to touch slavery in the border states, Goddard made clear\r\nthe fact that Lincoln had no constitutional \"right\" to apply his edict\r\nto states not in rebellion[951]. On the public platform no one equalled\r\nthe old anti-slavery orator, George Thompson, in the number of meetings\r\nattended and addresses made. In less than a month he had spoken\r\ntwenty-one times and often in places where opposition was in evidence.\r\nEverywhere Thompson found an aroused and encouraged anti-slavery\r\nfeeling, now strongly for the North[952].\r\n\r\nEight years earlier five hundred thousand English women had united in an\r\naddress to America on behalf of the slaves. Harriet Beecher Stowe now\r\nreplied to this and asked the renewed sympathy of her English sisters. A\r\nlargely signed \"round robin\" letter assured her that English women were\r\nstill the foes of slavery and were indignantly united against\r\nsuggestions of British recognition of the South[953]. Working class\r\nBritain was making its voice heard in support of the North. To those of\r\nManchester, Lincoln, on January 19, 1863, addressed a special letter of\r\nthanks for their earnest support while undergoing personal hardships\r\nresulting from the disruption of industry caused by the war. \"I cannot\"\r\nhe wrote, \"but regard your decisive utterances upon the question [of\r\nhuman slavery] as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not\r\nbeen surpassed in any age or in any country[954].\" Nonconformist England\r\nnow came vigorously to the support of the North. Spurgeon, in London,\r\nmade his great congregation pray with him: \"God bless and strengthen\r\nthe North; give victory to their arms[955].\" Further and more general\r\nexpression of Nonconformist church sympathy came as a result of a letter\r\nreceived February 12, 1863, from a number of French pastors and laymen,\r\nurging all the Evangelical churches to unite in an address to Lincoln.\r\nThe London and Manchester Emancipation Societies combined in drawing up\r\na document for signature by pastors and this was presented for adoption\r\nat a meeting in Manchester on June 3, 1863. In final form it was \"An\r\nAddress to Ministers and Pastors of All Christian Denominations\r\nthroughout the States of America.\" There was a \"noisy opposition\" but\r\nthe address was carried by a large majority and two representatives,\r\nMassie and Roylance, were selected to bear the message in person to the\r\nbrethren across the ocean[956]. Discussion arose over the Biblical\r\nsanction of slavery. In the _Times_ appeared an editorial pleading this\r\nsanction and arguing the _duty_ of slaves to refuse liberty[957].\r\nGoldwin Smith, Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, replied in\r\na pamphlet, \"Does the Bible sanction American Slavery[958]?\" His\r\nposition and his skill in presentation made him a valuable ally to\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nThus British anti-slavery circles, previously on the defensive, became\r\naroused and enthusiastic when Lincoln's January 1, 1863, proclamation\r\nmade good his pledge of the previous September: other elements of\r\nopinion, and in all classes, were strengthened in like measure, and\r\neverywhere the first expression of fear of a servile insurrection\r\nlargely disappeared. In truth, pro-Northern England went to such\r\nlengths in its support of emancipation as to astound and alarm the\r\n_Saturday Review_, which called these demonstrations a \"carnival of\r\ncant[959].\" More neutral minds were perplexed over the practical\r\ndifficulties and might well agree with Schleiden who wrote in January,\r\n1863, quoting Machiavelli: \"What is more difficult, to make free men\r\nslaves, or slaves free[960]?\" But by the end of January the popular\r\napproval of emancipation was in full swing. On the evening of the\r\ntwenty-ninth there took place in London at Exeter Hall, a great mass\r\nmeeting unprecedented in attendance and enthusiasm. The meeting had been\r\nadvertised for seven o'clock, but long before the hour arrived the hall\r\nwas jammed and the corridors filled. A second meeting was promptly\r\norganized for the lower hall, but even so the people seeking admission\r\ncrowded Exeter Street and seriously impeded traffic in the Strand.\r\nOutdoor meetings listened to reports of what was going on in the Hall\r\nand cheered the speakers. The main address was made by the Rev. Newman\r\nHall, of Surrey Chapel. A few Southern sympathizers who attempted to\r\nheckle the speakers were quickly shouted down[961].\r\n\r\nThe \"carnival of cant,\" as the _Saturday Review_ termed it, was truly a\r\npopular demonstration, stirred by anti-slavery leaders, but supported by\r\nthe working and non-enfranchised classes. Its first effect was to\r\nrestore courage and confidence to Northern supporters in the upper\r\nclasses. Bright had welcomed emancipation, yet with some misgivings. He\r\nnow joined in the movement and in a speech at Rochdale, February 3, on\r\n\"Slavery and Secession,\" gave full approval of Lincoln's efforts.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, shortly after the appearance of Spence's _American Union_,\r\nwhich had been greeted with great interest in England and had influenced\r\nlargely upper-class attitude in favour of the South, Cairnes had\r\npublished his pamphlet, \"Slave Power.\" This was a reasoned analysis of\r\nthe basis of slavery and a direct challenge to the thesis of\r\nSpence[962]. England's \"unnatural infatuation\" for a slave power,\r\nCairnes prophesied, would be short-lived. His pamphlet began to be read\r\nwith more conviction by that class which until now had been coldly\r\nneutral and which wished a more reassured faith in the Northern cause\r\nthan that stirred by the emotional reception given the emancipation\r\nproclamation. Yet at bottom it was emancipation that brought this\r\nreasoning public to seek in such works as that of Cairnes a logical\r\nbasis for a change of heart. Even in official circles, utterances\r\npreviously made in private correspondence, or in governmental\r\nconversations only, were now ventured in public by friends of the North.\r\nOn April 1, 1863, at a banquet given to Palmerston in Edinburgh, the\r\nDuke of Argyll ventured to answer a reference made by Palmerston in a\r\nspeech of the evening previous in which had been depicted the horrors of\r\nCivil War, by asking if Scotland were historically in a position to\r\nobject to civil wars having high moral purpose. \"I, for one,\" Argyll\r\nsaid, \"have not learned to be ashamed of that ancient combination of the\r\nBible and the sword. Let it be enough for us to pray and hope that the\r\ncontest, whenever it may be brought to an end, shall bring with it that\r\ngreat blessing to the white race which shall consist in the final\r\nfreedom of the black[963].\"\r\n\r\nThe public meetings in England raised high the hope in America that\r\ngovernmental England would show some evidence of a more friendly\r\nattitude. Lincoln himself drafted a resolution embodying the ideas he\r\nthought it would be wise for the public meetings to adopt. It read:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, while _heretofore_ States, and Nations, have\r\n     tolerated slavery, _recently_, for the first time in the\r\n     world, an attempt has been made to construct a new Nation,\r\n     upon the basis of, and with the primary, and fundamental\r\n     object to maintain, enlarge, and perpetuate human slavery,\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_: that no such embryo State should ever be\r\n     recognized by, or admitted into, the family of Christian and\r\n     civilized nations; and that all Christian and civilized men\r\n     everywhere should, by all lawful means, resist to the utmost,\r\n     such recognition or admission[964].\"\r\n\r\nThis American hope much disturbed Lyons. On his return to Washington, in\r\nNovember, 1862, he had regarded the emancipation proclamation as a\r\npolitical manoeuvre purely and an unsuccessful one. The administration\r\nhe thought was losing ground and the people tired of the war. This was\r\nthe burden of his private letters to Russell up to March, 1863, but does\r\nnot appear in his official despatches in which there was nothing to give\r\noffence to Northern statesmen. But in March, Lyons began to doubt the\r\ncorrectness of these judgments. He notes a renewed Northern enthusiasm\r\nleading to the conferring of extreme powers--the so-called \"dictatorship\r\nmeasures\"--upon Lincoln. Wise as Lyons ordinarily was he was bound by\r\nthe social and educational traditions of his class, and had at first not\r\nthe slightest conception of the force or effect of emancipation upon the\r\npublic in middle-class England. He feared an American reaction against\r\nEngland when it was understood that popular meetings would have no\r\ninfluence on the British Government.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Seward and the whole Party calculate immensely on the\r\n     effects of the anti-slavery meetings in England, and seem to\r\n     fancy that public feeling in England is coming so completely\r\n     round to the North that the Government will be obliged to\r\n     favour the North in all ways, even if it be disinclined to do\r\n     so. This notion is unlucky, as it makes those who hold it,\r\n     unreasonable and presumptuous in dealing with us[965].\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLincoln's plan of emancipation and his first proclamation had little\r\nrelation to American foreign policy. Seward's attitude toward\r\nemancipation was that the _threat_ of it and of a possible servile war\r\nmight be useful in deterring foreign nations, especially Great Britain,\r\nfrom intervening. But he objected to the carrying of emancipation into\r\neffect because he feared it would _induce_ intervention. Servile war, in\r\npart by Seward's own efforts, in part because of earlier British\r\nnewspaper speculations, was strongly associated with emancipation, in\r\nthe English view. Hence the Government received the September, 1862,\r\nproclamation with disfavour, the press with contempt, and the public\r\nwith apprehension--even the friends of the North. But no servile war\r\nensued. In January, 1863, Lincoln kept his promise of wide emancipation\r\nand the North stood committed to a high moral object. A great wave of\r\nrelief and exultation swept over anti-slavery England, but did not so\r\nquickly extend to governmental circles. It was largely that England\r\nwhich was as yet without direct influence on Parliament which so exulted\r\nand now upheld the North. Could this England of the people affect\r\ngovernmental policy and influence its action toward America? Lyons\r\ncorrectly interpreted the North and Seward as now more inclined to press\r\nthe British Government on points previously glossed over, and in the\r\nsame month in which Lyons wrote this opinion there was coming to a head\r\na controversy over Britain's duty as a neutral, which both during the\r\nwar and afterwards long seemed to Americans a serious and distinctly\r\nunfriendly breach of British neutrality. This was the building in\r\nBritish ports of Confederate naval vessels of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: _Punch_, Nov. 22, 1862, has a cartoon picturing\r\nPalmerston as presenting this view to Napoleon III.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: Rhodes, IV, p. 348.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: F.O., Am., Vol. 875.

Lyons\r\nwas slow to favour the emancipation proclamation. The first favourable\r\nmention I have found was on July 26, 1864. (Russell Papers. To Russell.)\r\nIn this view his diplomatic colleagues coincided. Stoeckl, in December,\r\n1863, wrote that slavery was dead in the Central and Border States, and\r\nthat even in the South its form must be altered if it survived. (Russian\r\nArchives, Stoeckl to F.O., Nov. 22-Dec. 4, 1863, No. 3358.) But\r\nimmediately after the second proclamation of January, 1863, Stoeckl\r\ncould see no possible good in such measures. If they had been made of\r\nuniversal application it would have been a \"great triumph for the\r\nprinciple of individual liberty,\" but as issued they could only mean\r\n\"the hope of stirring a servile war in the South.\" _(Ibid._, Dec. 24,\r\n1863-Jan. 5, 1864, No. 70.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAIRD RAMS\r\n\r\nThe building in British ports of Confederate war vessels like the\r\n_Alabama_ and the subsequent controversy and arbitration in relation\r\nthereto have been exhaustively studied and discussed from every aspect\r\nof legal responsibility, diplomatic relations, and principles of\r\ninternational law. There is no need and no purpose here to review in\r\ndetail these matters. The purpose is, rather, to consider the\r\ndevelopment and effect at the time of their occurrence of the principal\r\nincidents related to Southern ship-building in British yards. The\r\n_intention_ of the British Government is of greater importance in this\r\nstudy than the correctness of its action.\r\n\r\nYet it must first be understood that the whole question of a\r\nbelligerent's right to procure ships of war or to build them in the\r\nports of neutral nations was, in 1860, still lacking definite\r\napplication in international law. There were general principles already\r\nestablished that the neutral must not do, nor permit its subjects to do,\r\nanything directly in aid of belligerents. The British Foreign Enlistment\r\nAct, notification of which had been given in May, 1861, forbade subjects\r\nto \"be concerned in the equipping, furnishing, fitting out, or arming,\r\nof any ship or vessel, with intent or in order that such ship or vessel\r\nshall be employed in the service ...\" of a belligerent, and provided for\r\npunishment of individuals and forfeiture of vessels if this prohibition\r\nwere disobeyed. But the Act also declared that such punishment, or\r\nseizure, would follow on due proof of the offence. Here was the weak\r\npoint of the Act, for in effect if secrecy were maintained by offenders\r\nthe proof was available only after the offence had been committed and\r\none of the belligerents injured by the violation of the law. Over twenty\r\nyears earlier the American Government, seeking to prevent its subjects\r\nfrom committing unneutral acts in connection with the Canadian rebellion\r\nof 1837, had realized the weakness of its neutrality laws as they then\r\nstood, and by a new law of March 10, 1838, hastily passed and therefore\r\nlimited to two years' duration, in the expectation of a more perfect\r\nlaw, but intended as a clearer exposition of neutral duty, had given\r\nfederal officials power to act and seize _on suspicion_, leaving the\r\nproof of guilt or innocence to be determined later. But the British\r\ninterpretation of her own neutrality laws was that proof was required in\r\nadvance of seizure--an interpretation wholly in line with the basic\r\nprinciple that a man was innocent until proved guilty, but fatal to that\r\npreservation of strict neutrality which Great Britain had so promptly\r\nasserted at the beginning of the Civil War[966].\r\n\r\nThe South wholly lacking a navy or the means to create one, early\r\nconceived the idea of using neutral ports for the construction of war\r\nvessels. Advice secured from able British lawyers was to the effect that\r\nif care were taken to observe the strict letter of the Foreign\r\nEnlistment Act, by avoiding warlike equipment, a ship, even though her\r\nconstruction were such as to indicate that she was destined to become a\r\nship of war, might be built by private parties in British yards. The\r\nthree main points requiring careful observance by the South were\r\nconcealment of government ownership and destination, no war equipment\r\nand no enlistment of crew in British waters.\r\n\r\nThe principal agent selected by the South to operate on these lines was\r\nCaptain J.D. Bullock, who asserts in his book descriptive of his work\r\nthat he never violated British neutrality law and that prevailing legal\r\nopinion in England supported him in this view[967]. In March, 1862, the\r\nsteamer _Oreto_ cleared from Liverpool with a declared destination of\r\n\"Palermo, the Mediterranean, and Jamaica.\" She was not heard of until\r\nthree months later when she was reported to be at Nassau completing her\r\nequipment as a Southern war vessel. In June, Adams notified Russell\r\n\"that a new and still more powerful war-steamer was nearly ready for\r\ndeparture from the port of Liverpool on the same errand[968].\" He\r\nprotested that such ships violated the neutrality of Great Britain and\r\ndemanded their stoppage and seizure. From June 23 to July 28, when this\r\nsecond ship, \"No. 290\" (later christened the _Alabama_) left Liverpool,\r\nAdams and the United States consul at Liverpool, Dudley, were busy in\r\nsecuring evidence and in renewing protests to the Government. To each\r\nprotest Russell replied in but a few lines that the matter had been\r\nreferred to the proper departments, and it was not until July 26, when\r\nthere was received from Adams an opinion by an eminent Queen's Counsel,\r\nCollier, that the affidavits submitted were conclusive against the\r\n\"290,\" that Russell appears to have been seriously concerned. On July\r\n28, the law officers of the Crown were asked for an immediate opinion,\r\nand on the thirty-first telegrams were sent to Liverpool and to other\r\nports to stop and further examine the vessel. But the \"290\" was well\r\naway and outside of British waters[969].\r\n\r\nThe _Alabama_, having received guns and munitions by a ship, the\r\n_Bahama_, sent out from England to that end, and having enlisted in the\r\nConfederate Navy most of the British crews of the two vessels, now\r\nentered upon a career of destruction of Northern commerce. She was not a\r\nprivateer, as she was commonly called at the time, but a Government\r\nvessel of war specially intended to capture and destroy merchant ships.\r\nIn short her true character, in terms of modern naval usage, was that of\r\na \"commerce destroyer.\" Under an able commander, Captain Semmes, she\r\ntraversed all oceans, captured merchant ships and after taking coal and\r\nstores from them, sank or burnt the captures; for two years she evaded\r\nbattle with Northern war vessels and spread so wide a fear that an\r\nalmost wholesale transfer of the flag from American to British or other\r\nforeign register took place, in the mercantile marine. The career of the\r\n_Alabama_ was followed with increasing anger and chagrin by the North;\r\nthis, said the public, was a British ship, manned by a British crew,\r\nusing British guns and ammunition, whose escape from Liverpool had been\r\nwinked at by the British Government. What further evidence was necessary\r\nof bad faith in a professed strict neutrality?\r\n\r\nNor were American officials far behind the public in suspicion and\r\nanger. At the last moment it had appeared as if the Government were\r\ninclined to stop the \"290.\" Was the hurried departure of the vessel due\r\nto a warning received from official sources? On November 21, Adams\r\nreported that Russell complained in an interview of remarks made\r\nprivately by Bright, to the effect that warning had come from Russell\r\nhimself, and \"seemed to me a little as if he suspected that Mr. Bright\r\nhad heard this from me[970].\" Adams disavowed, and sincerely, any such\r\nimputation, but at the same time expressed to Russell his conviction\r\nthat there must have been from some source a \"leak\" of the Government's\r\nintention[971]. The question of advance warning to Bullock, or to the\r\nLairds who built the _Alabama_, was not one which was likely to be\r\nofficially put forward in any case; the real issue was whether an\r\noffence to British neutrality law had been committed, whether it would\r\nbe acknowledged as such, and still more important, whether repetitions\r\nof the offence would be permitted. The _Alabama_, even though she might,\r\nas the American assistant-secretary of the Navy wrote, be \"giving us a\r\nsick turn[972],\" could not by herself greatly affect the issue of the\r\nwar; but many _Alabamas_ would be a serious matter. The belated\r\ngovernmental order to stop the vessel was no assurance for the future\r\nsince in reply to Adams' protests after her escape, and to a prospective\r\nclaim for damages, Russell replied that in fact the orders to stop had\r\nbeen given merely for the purpose of further investigation, and that in\r\nstrict law there had been no neglect of governmental duty[973]. If this\r\nwere so similar precautions and secrecy would prohibit official\r\ninterference in the issue from British ports of a whole fleet of\r\nSouthern war-vessels. Russell might himself feel that a real offence to\r\nthe North had taken place. He might write, \"I confess the proceedings of\r\nthat vessel [the _Alabama_] are enough to _rile_ a more temperate\r\nnation, and I owe a grudge to the Liverpool people on that\r\naccount[974],\" but this was of no value to the North if the governmental\r\ndecision was against interference without complete and absolute proof.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore the concern of the North to find some means of bringing\r\nhome to the British Ministry the enormity of the offence in American\r\neyes and the serious danger to good relations if such offences were to\r\nbe continued. An immediate downright threat of war would have been\r\nimpolitic and would have stirred British pride to the point of\r\nresentment. Yet American pride was aroused also and it was required of\r\nSeward that he gain the Northern object and yet make no such threat as\r\nwould involve the two nations in war--a result that would have marked\r\nthe success of Southern secession. That Seward was able to find the way\r\nin which to do this is evidence of that fertility of imagination and\r\ngift in expedient which marked his whole career in the diplomacy of the\r\nCivil War[975].\r\n\r\nIn that same month when Adams was beginning his protests on the \"290,\"\r\nJune, 1862, there had already been drawn the plans, and the contracts\r\nmade with the Laird Brothers at Liverpool, for the building of two\r\nvessels far more dangerous than the _Alabama_ to the Northern cause.\r\nThese were the so-called Laird Rams. They were to be two hundred and\r\nthirty feet long, have a beam of forty feet, be armoured with four and\r\none-half inch iron plate and be provided with a \"piercer\" at the prow,\r\nabout seven feet long and of great strength. This \"piercer\" caused the\r\nships to be spoken of as rams, and when the vessels were fully equipped\r\nit was expected the \"piercer\" would be three feet under the surface of\r\nthe water. This was the distinguishing feature of the two ships; it was\r\nunusual construction, nearly impossible of use in an ordinary battle at\r\nsea, but highly dangerous to wooden ships maintaining a close blockade\r\nat some Southern port. While there was much newspaper comment in England\r\nthat the vessels were \"new _Alabamas_,\" and in America that they were\r\n\"floating fortresses,\" suitable for attack upon defenceless Northern\r\ncities, their primary purpose was to break up the blockading\r\nsquadrons[976].\r\n\r\nShortly before the escape of the _Alabama_ and at a time when there was\r\nbut little hope the British Government would seize her and shortly after\r\nthe news was received in Washington that still other vessels were\r\nplanned for building in the Lairds' yards, a Bill was introduced in\r\nCongress authorizing the President to issue letters of marque and\r\nprivateering. This was in July, 1862, and on the twelfth, Seward wrote\r\nto Adams of the proposed measure specifying that the purpose was to\r\npermit privateers to seek for and capture or destroy the _Alabama_ or\r\nother vessels of a like type. He characterized this as a plan \"to\r\norganize the militia of the seas by issuing letters of marque and\r\nreprisal[977].\" Neither here nor at any time did Seward or Adams allege\r\nin diplomatic correspondence any other purpose than the pursuit of\r\n_Alabamas_, nor is it presumable that in July, 1862, the construction\r\nplans of the Rams were sufficiently well known to the North to warrant a\r\nconclusion that the later purpose of the proposed privateering fleet was\r\n_at first_ quite other than the alleged purpose. Probably the Bill\r\nintroduced in July, 1862, was but a hasty reaction to the sailing of the\r\n_Oreto_ (or _Florida_) and to the failure of early protests in the case\r\nof the _Alabama_. Moreover there had been an earlier newspaper agitation\r\nfor an increase of naval power by the creation of a \"militia of the\r\nseas,\" though with no clear conception of definite objects to be\r\nattained. This agitation was now renewed and reinforced and many public\r\nspeeches made by a General Hiram Wallbridge, who had long advocated an\r\norganization of the mercantile marine as an asset in times of war[978].\r\nBut though introduced in the summer of 1862, the \"privateering bill\" was\r\nnot seriously taken up until February, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate discussion of the Bill at the time of introduction,\r\nSenator Grimes, its sponsor, declared that the object was to encourage\r\nprivateers to pursue British ships when, as was expected, they should\r\n\"turn Confederate.\" Sumner objected that the true business of privateers\r\nwas to destroy enemy commerce and that the South had no such _bona fide_\r\ncommerce. Grimes agreed that this was his opinion also, but explained\r\nthat the administration wanted the measure passed so that it might have\r\nin its hands a power to be used if the need arose. The general opinion\r\nof the Senate was opposed and the matter was permitted to lapse, but\r\nwithout definite action, so that it could at any time be called up\r\nagain[979]. Six months later the progress of construction and the\r\npurpose of the rams at Liverpool were common knowledge. On January 7,\r\n1863, the privateering bill again came before the Senate, was referred\r\nto the committee on naval affairs, reported out, and on February 17 was\r\npassed and sent to the House of Representatives, where on March 2 it was\r\ngiven a third reading and passed without debate[980]. In the Senate,\r\nGrimes now clearly stated that the Bill was needed because the\r\nConfederates \"are now building in England a fleet of vessels designed to\r\nbreak our blockade of their coast,\" and that the privateers were to\r\n\"assist in maintaining blockades.\" There was no thorough debate but a\r\nfew perfunctory objections were raised to placing so great a power in\r\nthe hands of the President, while Sumner alone appears as a consistent\r\nopponent arguing that the issue of privateers would be dangerous to the\r\nNorth since it might lead to an unwarranted interference with neutral\r\ncommerce. No speaker outlined the exact method by which privateers were\r\nto be used in \"maintaining blockades\"; the bill was passed as an\r\n\"administration measure.\"\r\n\r\nCoincidently, but as yet unknown in Washington, the chagrin of Russell\r\nat the escape of the _Alabama_ had somewhat lost its edge. At first he\r\nhad been impressed with the necessity of amending the Foreign Enlistment\r\nAct so as to prevent similar offences and had gained the approval of the\r\nlaw officers of the Crown. Russell had even offered to take up with\r\nAmerica an agreement by which both countries were to amend their\r\nneutrality laws at the same moment. This was in December, 1862, but now\r\non February 14, 1863, he wrote to Lyons that the project of amendment\r\nhad been abandoned as the Cabinet saw no way of improving the law[981].\r\nWhile this letter to Lyons was on its way to America, a letter from\r\nSeward was _en route_, explaining to Adams the meaning of the\r\nprivateering bill.\r\n\r\n\"The Senate has prepared a Bill which confers upon the President of the\r\nUnited States the power to grant letters of marque and reprisal in any\r\nwar in which the country may at any time be engaged, and it is expected\r\nthat the Bill will become a law. Lord Lyons suggests that the\r\ntransaction may possibly be misapprehended abroad, if it come upon\r\nforeign powers suddenly and without any explanations. You will be at\r\nliberty to say that, as the Bill stands, the executive Government will\r\nbe set at liberty to put the law in force in its discretion, and that\r\nthus far the proper policy in regard to the exercise of that discretion\r\nhas not engaged the President's attention. I have had little hesitation\r\nin saying to Lord Lyons that if no extreme circumstances occur, there\r\nwill be entire frankness on the part of the Government in communicating\r\nto him upon the subject, so far as to avoid any surprise on the part of\r\nfriendly nations, whose commerce or navigation it might be feared would\r\nbe incidentally and indirectly affected, if it shall be found expedient\r\nto put the Act in force against the insurgents of the United\r\nStates[982].\"\r\n\r\nCertainly this was vague explanation, yet though the main object might\r\nbe asserted \"to put the act in force against the insurgents,\" the hint\r\nwas given that the commerce of friendly neutrals might be \"incidentally\r\nand indirectly affected.\" And so both Lyons and Seward understood the\r\nmatter, for on February 24, Lyons reported a long conversation with\r\nSeward in which after pointing out the probable \"bad effect\" on Europe,\r\nLyons received the reply that some remedy must be found for the fact\r\nthat \"the law did not appear to enable the British Government to\r\nprevent\" the issue of Confederate \"privateers[983].\" On March 8, Seward\r\nfollowed this up by sending to Lyons an autograph letter:\r\n\r\n     \"I am receiving daily such representations from our sea-ports\r\n     concerning the depredations on our commerce committed by the\r\n     vessels built and practically fitted out in England, that I\r\n     do most sincerely apprehend a new element is entering into\r\n     the unhappy condition of affairs, which, with all the best\r\n     dispositions of your Government and my own, cannot long be\r\n     controlled to the preservation of peace.\r\n\r\n     \"If you think well of it, I should like that you should\r\n     confidentially inform Earl Russell that the departure of more\r\n     armed vessels under insurgent-rebel command from English\r\n     ports is a thing to be deprecated above all things.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 9th, Lyons had a long talk with Seward about this, and it\r\nappears that Lincoln had seen the letter and approved it. Seward stated\r\nthat the New York Chamber of Commerce had protested about the _Alabama_,\r\ndeclaring:\r\n\r\n     \"That no American merchant vessels would get freights--that\r\n     even war with England was preferable to this--that in that\r\n     case the maritime enterprise of the country would at least\r\n     find a profitable employment in cruising against British\r\n     trade.\"\r\n\r\nSeward went on to show the necessity of letters of marque, and Lyons\r\nprotested vigorously and implied that war must result.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Seward said that he was well aware of the inconvenience\r\n     not to say the danger of issuing Letters of Marque: that he\r\n     should be glad to delay doing so, or to escape the necessity\r\n     altogether; but that really unless some intelligence came\r\n     from England to allay the public exasperation, the measure\r\n     would be unavoidable[984].\"\r\n\r\nLyons was much alarmed, writing that the feeling in the North must not\r\nbe underestimated and pointing out that the newspapers were dwelling on\r\nthe notion that under British interpretation of her duty as a neutral\r\nMexico, if she had money, could build ships in British ports to cruise\r\nin destruction of French commerce, adding that \"one might almost\r\nsuppose\" some rich American would give the funds to Mexico for the\r\npurpose and so seek to involve England in trouble with France[985].\r\nLyons had also been told by Seward in their conversation of March 9,\r\nthat on that day an instruction had been sent to Adams to present to\r\nRussell the delicacy of the situation and to ask for some assurance that\r\nno further Southern vessels of war should escape from British ports.\r\nThis instruction presented the situation in more diplomatic language but\r\nin no uncertain tone, yet still confined explanation of the privateering\r\nbill as required to prevent the \"destruction of our national navigating\r\ninterest, unless that calamity can be prevented by ... the enforcement\r\nof the neutrality law of Great Britain[986]....\"\r\n\r\nLyons' reports reached Russell before Seward's instruction was read to\r\nhim. Russell had already commented to Adams that American privateers\r\nwould find no Confederate merchant ships and that if they interfered\r\nwith neutral commerce the United States Government would be put in an\r\nawkward position. To this Adams replied that the privateers would seek\r\nand capture, if possible, vessels like the _Alabama_, but Russell asked\r\nLyons to find out \"whether in any case they [privateers] will be\r\nauthorized to interfere with neutral commerce, and if in any case in\r\nwhat case, and to what extent[987].\" Three days later, on March 26,\r\nAdams presented his instructions and these Russell regarded as \"not\r\nunfriendly in tone,\" but in the long conversation that ensued the old\r\nresult was reached that Adams declared Great Britain negligent in\r\nperformance of neutral duty, while Russell professed eagerness to stop\r\nSouthern shipbuilding if full evidence was \"forthcoming.\" Adams\r\nconcluded that \"he had worked to the best of his power for peace, but it\r\nhad become a most difficult task.\" Upon this Russell commented to Lyons,\r\n\"Mr. Adams fully deserves the character of having always laboured for\r\npeace between our two Nations. Nor I trust will his efforts, and those\r\nof the two Governments fail of success[988].\"\r\n\r\nIn these last days of March matters were in fact rapidly drawing to a\r\nhead both in America and England. At Washington, from March seventh to\r\nthe thirty-first, the question of issuing letters of marque and reprisal\r\nhad been prominently before the Cabinet and even Welles who had opposed\r\nthem was affected by unfavourable reports received from Adams as to the\r\nintentions of Great Britain. The final decision was to wait later news\r\nfrom England[989]. This was Seward's idea as he had not as yet received\r\nreports of the British reaction to his communications through Lyons and\r\nAdams. March 27 was the critical day of decision in London, as it was\r\nalso the day upon which public and parliamentary opinion was most\r\nvigorously debated in regard to Great Britain's neutral duty. Preceding\r\nthis other factors of influence were coming to the front. In the first\r\ndays of March, Slidell, at Paris, had received semi-official assurances\r\nthat if the South wished to build ships in French yards \"we should be\r\npermitted to arm and equip them and proceed to sea[990].\" This\r\nsuggestion was permitted to percolate in England with the intention, no\r\ndoubt, of strengthening Bullock's position there. In the winter of\r\n1862-3, orders had been sent to the Russian Baltic fleet to cruise in\r\nwestern waters and there was first a suspicion in America, later a\r\nconviction, that the purpose of this cruise was distinctly friendly to\r\nthe North--that the orders might even extend to actual naval aid in case\r\nwar should arise with England and France. In March, 1863, this\r\nwas but vague rumour, by midsummer it was a confident hope, by\r\nSeptember-October, when Russian fleets had entered the harbours of New\r\nYork and San Francisco, the rumour had become a conviction and the\r\nsilence of Russian naval officers when banqueted and toasted was\r\nregarded as discreet confirmation. There was no truth in the rumour, but\r\nalready in March curious surmises were being made even in England, as to\r\nRussian intentions, though there is no evidence that the Government was\r\nat all concerned. The truth was that the Russian fleet had been ordered\r\nto sea as a precaution against easy destruction in Baltic waters, in\r\ncase the difficulties developing in relation to Poland should lead to\r\nwar with France and England[991].\r\n\r\nIn England, among the people rather than in governmental England, a\r\nfeeling was beginning to manifest itself that the Ministry had been lax\r\nin regard to the _Alabama_, and as news of her successes was received\r\nthis feeling was given voice. Liverpool, at first almost wholly on the\r\nside of the Lairds and of Southern ship-building, became doubtful by\r\nthe very ease with which the _Alabama_ destroyed Northern ships.\r\nLiverpool merchants looked ahead and saw that their interests might,\r\nafter all, be directly opposed to those of the ship-builders. Meetings\r\nwere held and the matter discussed. In February, 1863, such a meeting at\r\nPlaistow, attended by the gentry of the neighbourhood, but chiefly by\r\nworking men, especially by dock labourers and by men from the\r\nship-building yards at Blackwall, resolved that \"the Chairman be\r\nrequested to write to the Prime Minister of our Queen, earnestly\r\nentreating him to put in force, with utmost vigilance, the law of\r\nEngland against such ships as the _Alabama_[992].\" Such expressions were\r\nnot as yet widespread, nor did the leading papers, up to April, indulge\r\nin much discussion, but British _doubt_ was developing[993].\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, Russell himself was experiencing a renewed doubt as to\r\nBritain's neutral duty. On March 23, he made a speech in Parliament\r\nwhich Adams reported as \"the most satisfactory of all the speeches he\r\nhas made since I have been at this post[994].\" On March 26, came the\r\npresentation by Adams of Seward's instruction of which Russell wrote to\r\nLyons as made in no unfriendly tone and as a result of which Adams\r\nwrote: \"The conclusion which I draw ... is, that the Government is\r\nreally better disposed to exertion, and feels itself better sustained\r\nfor action by the popular sentiment than ever before[995].\" Russell told\r\nAdams that he had received a note from Palmerston \"expressing his\r\napprobation of every word\" of his speech three days before. In a portion\r\nof the despatch to Seward, not printed in the Diplomatic Correspondence,\r\nAdams advised against the issue of privateers, writing, \"In the present\r\nfavourable state of popular mind, it scarcely seems advisable to run the\r\nrisk of changing the current in Great Britain by the presentation of a\r\nnew issue which might rally all national pride against us as was done in\r\nthe _Trent_ case[996].\" That Russell was indeed thinking of definite\r\naction is foreshadowed by the advice he gave to Palmerston on March 27,\r\nas to the latter's language in the debate scheduled for that day on the\r\nForeign Enlistment Act. Russell wrote, referring to the interview\r\nwith Adams:\r\n\r\n     \"The only thing which Adams could think of when I asked him\r\n     what he had to propose in reference to the _Alabama_ was that\r\n     the Government should declare their disapproval of the\r\n     fitting out of such ships of war to prey on\r\n     American commerce.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, as the fitting out and escape of the _Alabama_ and\r\n     _Oreto_ was clearly an evasion of our law, I think you can\r\n     have no difficulty in declaring this evening that the\r\n     Government disapprove of all such attempts to elude our law\r\n     with a view to assist one of the belligerents[997].\"\r\n\r\nBut the tone of parliamentary debate did not bear out the hopeful view\r\nof the American Minister. It was, as Bright wrote to Sumner, \"badly\r\nmanaged and told against us[998],\" and Bright himself participated in\r\nthis \"bad management.\" For over a year he had been advocating the cause\r\nof the North in public speeches and everywhere pointing out to\r\nunenfranchised England that the victory of the North was essential to\r\ndemocracy in all Europe. Always an orator of power he used freely\r\nvigorous language and nowhere more so than in a great public meeting of\r\nthe Trades Unions of London in St. James' Hall, on March 26, the evening\r\nbefore the parliamentary debate. The purpose of this meeting was to\r\nbring public pressure on the Government in favour of the North, and the\r\npith of Bright's speech was to contrast the democratic instincts of\r\nworking men with the aristocratic inclinations of the Government[999].\r\nReviewing \"aristocratic\" attitude toward the Civil War, Bright said:\r\n\r\n     \"Privilege thinks it has a great interest in this contest,\r\n     and every morning, with blatant voice, it comes into your\r\n     streets and curses the American Republic. Privilege has\r\n     beheld an afflicting spectacle for many years past. It has\r\n     beheld thirty millions of men, happy and prosperous, without\r\n     emperor, without king, without the surroundings of a court,\r\n     without nobles, except such as are made by eminence in\r\n     intellect and virtue, without State bishops and\r\n     State priests.\r\n\r\n     \"'Sole venders of the lore which works salvation,' without\r\n     great armies and great navies, without great debt and without\r\n     great taxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"You wish the freedom of your country. You wish it for\r\n     yourselves.... Do not then give the hand of fellowship to the\r\n     worst foes of freedom that the world has ever seen.... You\r\n     will not do this. I have faith in you. Impartial history\r\n     will tell that, when your statesmen were hostile or coldly\r\n     neutral, when many of your rich men were corrupt, when your\r\n     press--which ought to have instructed and defended--was\r\n     mainly written to betray, the fate of a Continent and of its\r\n     vast population being in peril, you clung to freedom with an\r\n     unfailing trust that God in his infinite mercy will yet make\r\n     it the heritage of all His children[1000].\"\r\n\r\nThe public meeting of March 26 was the most notable one in support of\r\nthe North held throughout the whole course of the war, and it was also\r\nthe most notable one as indicating the rising tide of popular demand for\r\nmore democratic institutions. That it irritated the Government and gave\r\na handle to Southern sympathizers in the parliamentary debate of March\r\n27 is unquestioned. In addition, if that debate was intended to secure\r\nfrom the Government an intimation of future policy against Southern\r\nshipbuilding it was conducted on wrong lines for _immediate_\r\neffect--though friends of the North may have thought the method used was\r\nwise for _future_ effect. This method was vigorous attack. Forster,\r\nleading in the debate[1001], called on Ministers to explain the\r\n\"flagrant\" violation of the Foreign Enlistment Act, and to offer some\r\npledge for the future; he asserted that the Government should have been\r\nactive on its own initiative in seeking evidence instead of waiting to\r\nbe urged to enforce the law, and he even hinted at a certain degree of\r\ncomplicity in the escape of the _Alabama_. The Solicitor-General\r\nanswered in a legal defence of the Government, complained of the offence\r\nof America in arousing its citizens against Great Britain upon\r\nunjustifiable grounds, but did not make so vigorous a reply as might,\r\nperhaps, have been expected. Still he stood firmly on the ground that\r\nthe Government could not act without evidence to convict--in itself a\r\nstatement that might well preclude interference with the Rams. Bright\r\naccused the Government of a \"cold and unfriendly neutrality,\" and\r\nreferred at length to the public meeting of the previous evening:\r\n\r\n     \"If you had last night looked in the faces of three thousand\r\n     of the most intelligent of the artisan classes in London, as\r\n     I did, and heard their cheers, and seen their sympathy for\r\n     that country for which you appear to care so little, you\r\n     would imagine that the more forbearing, the more generous,\r\n     and the more just the conduct of the Government to the United\r\n     States, the more it would recommend itself to the magnanimous\r\n     feelings of the people of this country.\"\r\n\r\nThis assumption of direct opposition between Parliament and the people\r\nwas not likely to win or to convince men, whether pro-Southern or not,\r\nwho were opponents of the speaker's long-avowed advocacy of more\r\ndemocratic institutions in England. It is no wonder then that Laird, who\r\nhad been castigated in the speeches of the evening, rising in defence of\r\nthe conduct of his firm, should seek applause by declaring, \"I would\r\nrather be handed down to posterity as the builder of a dozen _Alabamas_\r\nthan as a man who applies himself deliberately to set class against\r\nclass, and to cry up the institutions of another country which, when\r\nthey come to be tested, are of no value whatever, and which reduce the\r\nvery name of liberty to an utter absurdity.\" This utterance was greeted\r\nwith great cheering--shouted not so much in approval of the _Alabama_ as\r\nin approval of the speaker's defiance of Bright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM EDWARD FORSTER (1851)]\r\n\r\nIn short, the friends of the North, if they sought some immediate pledge\r\nby the Government, had gone the wrong way about to secure it. Vigour in\r\nattack was no way to secure a favourable response from Palmerston.\r\nAlways a fighting politician in public it was inevitable that he should\r\nnow fight back. Far from making the statement recommended to him by\r\nRussell, he concluded the debate by reasserting the correctness of\r\ngovernmental procedure in the case of the _Alabama_, and himself with\r\nvigour accused Forster and Bright of speaking in such a way as to\r\nincrease rather than allay American irritation. Yet a careful reading of\r\nthe speeches of both the Solicitor-General and of Palmerston, shows that\r\nwhile vindicating the Government's conduct in the past, they were\r\navoiding _any_ pledge of whatever nature, for the future.\r\n\r\nAdams was clearly disappointed and thought that the result of the debate\r\nwas \"rather to undo in the popular mind the effect of Lord Russell's\r\nspeech than to confirm it[1002].\" He and his English advisers were very\r\nuneasy, not knowing whether to trust to Russell's intimations of more\r\nactive governmental efforts, or to accept the conclusion that his advice\r\nhad been rejected by Palmerston[1003]. Possibly if less anxious and\r\nalarmed they would have read more clearly between the lines of\r\nparliamentary utterances and have understood that their failure to hurry\r\nthe Government into public announcement of a new policy was no proof\r\nthat old policy would be continued. Disappointed at the result in\r\nParliament, they forgot that the real pressure on Government was coming\r\nfrom an American declaration of an intention to issue privateers unless\r\nsomething were done to satisfy that country. Certainly Russell was\r\nunmoved by the debate for on April 3 he wrote to Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"The conduct of the gentlemen who have contracted for the\r\n     ironclads at Birkenhead is so very suspicious that I have\r\n     thought it necessary to direct that they should be detained.\r\n     The Attorney-General has been consulted and concurs in the\r\n     measure, as one of policy, though not of strict law.\r\n\r\n     \"We shall thus test the law, and if we have to pay damages we\r\n     have satisfied the opinion which prevails here as well as in\r\n     America that this kind of neutral hostility should not be\r\n     allowed to go on without some attempt to stop it[1004].\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on April 5, the _Alexandra_, a vessel being equipped to\r\njoin the _Alabama_ as a commerce destroyer, was seized on the ground\r\nthat she was about to violate the Enlistment Act and a new policy, at\r\nleast to make a test case in law, was thereby made public. In fact, on\r\nMarch 30, but three days after the debate of March 27, the case of the\r\n_Alexandra_ had been taken up by Russell, referred to the law officers\r\non March 31, and approved by them for seizure on April 4[1005]. Public\r\nmeetings were quickly organized in support of the Government's action,\r\nas that in Manchester on April 6, when six thousand people applauded the\r\nseizure of the _Alexandra_, demanded vigorous prosecution of the Lairds\r\nand others, and urged governmental activity to prevent any further\r\nship-building for the South[1006].\r\n\r\nOn April 7, Russell wrote to Lyons:\r\n\r\n     \"The orders given to watch, and stop when evidence can be\r\n     procured, vessels apparently intended for the Confederate\r\n     service will, it is to be hoped, allay the strong feelings\r\n     which have been raised in Northern America by the escape from\r\n     justice of the _Oreto_ and _Alabama_[1007].\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that orders had been issued to stop, on _evidence_ to be\r\nsure, but on evidence of the vessels being \"_apparently_ intended\" for\r\nthe South. This was far from being the same thing as the previous\r\nassertion that conclusive evidence was required. What, then, was the\r\nbasic consideration in Russell's mind leading to such a face-about on\r\ndeclared policy? Chagrin at the very evident failure of existing\r\nneutrality law to operate, recognition that there was just cause for the\r\nrising ill-will of the North, no doubt influenced him, but more powerful\r\nthan these elements was the anxiety as to the real purpose and intent in\r\napplication of the American \"privateering\" Bill. How did Russell, and\r\nLyons, interpret that Bill and what complications did they foresee\r\nand fear?\r\n\r\nAs previously stated in this chapter, the privateering Bill had been\r\nintroduced as an \"administration measure\" and for that reason passed\r\nwithout serious debate. In the Cabinet it was opposed by Welles,\r\nSecretary of the Navy, until he was overborne by the feeling that\r\n\"something must be done\" because vessels were building in England\r\nintended to destroy the blockade. The Rams under construction were\r\nclearly understood to have that purpose. If privateers were to offset\r\nthe action of the Rams there must be some definite plan for their use.\r\nSeward and Adams repeatedly complained of British inaction yet in the\r\nsame breath asserted that the privateers were intended to chase and\r\ndestroy _Alabamas_--a plan so foolish, so it seemed to British\r\ndiplomats, as to be impossible of acceptance as the full purpose of\r\nSeward. How, in short, _could_ privateers make good an injury to\r\nblockade about to be done by the Rams? If added to the blockading\r\nsquadrons on station off the Southern ports they would but become so\r\nmuch more fodder for the dreaded Rams. If sent to sea in pursuit of\r\n_Alabamas_ the chances were that they would be the vanquished rather\r\nthan the victors in battle. There was no Southern mercantile marine for\r\nthem to attack and privateering against \"enemy's commerce\" was thus out\r\nof the question since there was no such commerce.\r\n\r\nThere remained but one reasonable supposition as to the intended use of\r\nprivateers. If the Rams compelled the relaxation of the close blockade\r\nthe only recourse of the North would be to establish a \"cruising\r\nsquadron\" blockade remote from the shores of the enemy. If conducted by\r\ngovernment war-ships such a blockade was not in contravention to British\r\ninterpretation of international law[1008]. But the Northern navy,\r\nconducting a cruising squadron blockade was far too small to interfere\r\nseriously with neutral vessels bringing supplies to the Confederacy or\r\ncarrying cotton from Southern ports. A \"flood of privateers,\" scouring\r\nthe ocean from pole to pole might, conceivably, still render effective\r\nthat closing in of the South which was so important a weapon in the\r\nNorthern war programme.\r\n\r\nThis was Russell's interpretation of the American plan and he saw in it\r\na very great danger to British commerce and an inevitable ultimate clash\r\nleading to war. Such, no doubt, it was Seward's desire should be\r\nRussell's reaction, though never specifically explaining the exact\r\npurpose of the privateers. Moreover, nine-tenths of the actual\r\nblockade-running still going on was by British ships, and this being so\r\nit was to be presumed that \"privateers\" searching for possible blockade\r\nrunners would commit all sorts of indignities and interferences with\r\nBritish merchant ships whether on a blockade-running trip or engaged in\r\nordinary trade between non-belligerent ports.\r\n\r\nImmediately on learning from Lyons details of the privateering bill,\r\nRussell had instructed the British Minister at Washington to raise\r\nobjections though not formally making official protest, and had asked\r\nfor explanation of the exact nature of the proposed activities of such\r\nvessels. Also he had prepared instructions to be issued by the\r\nAdmiralty to British naval commanders as to their duty of preventing\r\nunwarranted interference with legitimate British commerce by\r\nprivateers[1009]. The alteration of governmental policy as indicated in\r\nthe arrest of the _Alexandra_, it might be hoped, would at least cause a\r\nsuspension of the American plan, but assurances were strongly desired.\r\nPresumably Russell knew that Adams as a result of their conversations,\r\nhad recommended such suspension, but at Washington, Lyons, as yet\r\nuninformed of the _Alexandra_ action, was still much alarmed. On April\r\n13 he reported that Seward had read to him a despatch to Adams, relative\r\nto the ships building in England, indicating that this was \"a last\r\neffort to avert the evils which the present state of things had made\r\nimminent[1010].\" Lyons had argued with Seward the inadvisability of\r\nsending such a despatch, since it was now known that Russell had \"spoken\r\nin a satisfactory manner\" about Confederate vessels, but Seward was\r\ninsistent. Lyons believed there was real cause for anxiety, writing:\r\n\r\n     \"A good deal of allowance must be made for the evident design\r\n     of the Government and indeed of the people to intimidate\r\n     England, but still there can be little doubt that the\r\n     exasperation has reached such a point as to constitute a\r\n     serious danger. It is fully shared by many important members\r\n     of the Cabinet--nor are the men in high office exempt from\r\n     the overweening idea of the naval power of the United States,\r\n     which reconciles the people to the notion of a war with\r\n     England. Mr. Seward for a certain time fanned the flame in\r\n     order to recover his lost popularity. He is now, I believe,\r\n     seriously anxious to avoid going farther. But if strong\r\n     measures against England were taken up as a Party cry by the\r\n     Republicans, Mr. Seward would oppose very feeble resistance\r\n     to them. If no military success be obtained within a short\r\n     time, it may become a Party necessity to resort to some means\r\n     of producing an excitement in the country sufficient to\r\n     enable the Government to enforce the Conscription Act, and to\r\n     exercise the extra-legal powers conferred by the late\r\n     Congress, To produce such an excitement the more ardent of\r\n     the party would not hesitate to go, to the verge of a war\r\n     with England. Nay there are not a few who already declare\r\n     that if the South must be lost, the best mode to conceal the\r\n     discomfiture of the party and of the nation, would be to go\r\n     to war with England and attribute the loss of the South to\r\n     English interference[1011].\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day Lyons wrote, privately:\r\n\r\n     \"I would rather the quarrel came, if come it must, upon some\r\n     better ground for us than this question of the ships fitted\r\n     out for the Confederates. The great point to be gained in my\r\n     opinion, would be to prevent the ships sailing, without\r\n     leading the people here to think that they had gained their\r\n     point by threats[1012].\"\r\n\r\nSo great was Lyons' alarm that the next day, April 14, he\r\ncipher-telegraphed Monck in Canada that trouble was brewing[1013], but\r\nsoon his fears were somewhat allayed. On the seventeenth he could report\r\nthat Seward's \"strong\" despatch to Adams was not intended for\r\ncommunication to Russell[1014], and on the twenty-fourth when\r\npresenting, under instructions, Russell's protest against the\r\nprivateering plan he was pleased, if not surprised, to find that the\r\n\"latest advices\" from England and the news of the seizure of the\r\n_Alexandra_, had caused Seward to become very conciliatory. Lyons was\r\nassured that the plan \"was for the present at rest[1015].\" Apparently\r\nSeward now felt more security than did Lyons as to future British action\r\nfor three days later the British Minister wrote to Vice-Admiral Milne\r\nthat an American issue of letters of marque would surely come if\r\nEngland did not stop Southern ship-building, and he wrote in such a way\r\nas to indicate his own opinion that effective steps _must_ be taken to\r\nprevent their escape[1016].\r\n\r\nThe whole tone and matter of Lyons' despatches to Russell show that he\r\nregarded the crisis of relations in regard to Southern ship-building in\r\nBritish yards as occurring in March-April, 1863. Seward became unusually\r\nfriendly, even embarrassingly so, for in August he virtually forced\r\nLyons to go on tour with him through the State of New York, thus making\r\npublic demonstration of the good relations of the two Governments. This\r\nsweet harmony and mutual confidence is wholly contrary to the usual\r\nhistorical treatment of the Laird Rams incident, which neglects the\r\nthreat of the privateering bill, regards American protests as steadily\r\nincreasing in vigour, and concludes with the \"threat of war\" note by\r\nAdams to Russell just previous to the seizure of the Rams, in September.\r\nPreviously, however, American historians have been able to use only\r\nAmerican sources and have been at a loss to understand the privateering\r\nplan, since Seward never went beyond a vague generalization of its\r\nobject in official utterances. It is the British reaction to that plan\r\nwhich reveals the real \"threat\" made and the actual crisis of\r\nthe incident.\r\n\r\nIt follows therefore that the later story of the Rams requires less\r\nextended treatment than is customarily given to it. The correct\r\nunderstanding of this later story is the recognition that Great Britain\r\nhad in April given, a pledge and performed an act which satisfied Seward\r\nand Adams that the Rams would not be permitted to escape. It was their\r\nduty nevertheless to be on guard against a British relaxation of the\r\npromise made, and the delay, up to the very last moment, in seizing the\r\nRams, caused American anxiety and ultimately created a doubt of the\r\nsincerity of British actions.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in England was steadily increasing against Southern\r\nship-building. On June 9, a memorial was sent to the Foreign Office by a\r\ngroup of ship-owners in Liverpool, suggesting an alteration in the\r\nForeign Enlistment Act if this were needed to prevent the issue of\r\nSouthern ships, and pointing out that the \"present policy\" of the\r\nGovernment would entail a serious danger to British commerce in the\r\nfuture if, when England herself became a belligerent, neutral ports\r\ncould be used by the enemy to build commerce destroyers[1017]. The\r\nmemorial concluded that in any case it was a disgrace that British law\r\nshould be so publicly infringed. To this, Hammond, under-secretary, gave\r\nthe old answer that the law was adequate \"provided proof can be obtained\r\nof any act done with the intent to violate it[1018].\" Evidently\r\nship-owners, as distinguished from ship-builders, were now acutely\r\nalarmed. Meanwhile attention was fixed on the trial of the _Alexandra_,\r\nand on June 22, a decision was rendered against the Government, but was\r\npromptly appealed.\r\n\r\nThis decision made both Northern and Southern agents anxious and the\r\nlatter took steps further to becloud the status of the Rams. Rumours\r\nwere spread that the vessels were in fact intended for France, and when\r\nthis was disproved that they were being built for the Viceroy of Egypt.\r\nThis also proved to be untrue. Finally it was declared that the real\r\nowners were certain French merchants whose purpose in contracting for\r\nsuch clearly warlike vessels was left in mystery, but with the\r\nintimation that Egypt was to be the ultimate purchaser. Captain Bullock\r\nhad indeed made such a contract of sale to French merchants but with the\r\nproviso of resale to him, after delivery. On his part, Russell was\r\nseeking _proof_ fully adequate to seizure, but this was difficult to\r\nobtain and such as was submitted was regarded by the law officers as\r\ninadequate. They reported that there was \"no evidence capable of being\r\npresented to a court of justice.\" He informed Adams of this legal\r\nopinion at the moment when the latter, knowing the Rams to be nearing\r\ncompletion, and fearing that Russell was weakening in his earlier\r\ndetermination, began that series of diplomatic protests which very\r\nnearly approached a threat of war.\r\n\r\nAt Washington also anxiety was again aroused by the court's decision in\r\nthe _Alexandra_ case, and shortly after the great Northern victories at\r\nVicksburg and Gettysburg, Seward wrote a despatch to Adams, July 11,\r\nwhich has been interpreted as a definite threat of war. In substance\r\nSeward wrote that he still felt confident the Government of Great\r\nBritain would find a way to nullify the _Alexandra_ decision, but\r\nrenewed, in case this did not prove true, his assertion of Northern\r\nintention to issue letters of marque, adding a phrase about the right to\r\n\"pursue\" Southern vessels even into neutral ports[1019]. But there are\r\ntwo considerations in respect to this despatch that largely negative the\r\nbelligerent intent attributed to it: Seward did not read or communicate\r\nit to Lyons, as was his wont when anything serious was in mind; and he\r\ndid not instruct Adams to communicate it to Russell. The latter never\r\nheard of it until the publication, in 1864, of the United States\r\ndiplomatic correspondence[1020].\r\n\r\nIn London, on July 11, Adams began to present to Russell evidence\r\nsecured by Consul Dudley at Liverpool, relative to the Rams and to urge\r\ntheir immediate seizure. Adams here but performed his duty and was in\r\nfact acting in accordance with Russell's own request[1021]. On July 16\r\nhe reported to Seward that the Roebuck motion for recognition of the\r\nSouth[1022] had died ingloriously, but expressed a renewal of anxiety\r\nbecause of the slowness of the government; if the Rams were to escape,\r\nAdams wrote to Russell, on July 11, Britain would herself become a\r\nparticipant in the war[1023]. Further affidavits were sent to Russell on\r\nAugust 14, and on September 3, having heard from Russell that the\r\nGovernment was legally advised \"they cannot interfere in any way with\r\nthese vessels,\" Adams sent still more affidavits and expressed his\r\nregret that his previous notes had not sufficiently emphasized the grave\r\nnature of the crisis pending between the United States and Great\r\nBritain. To this Russell replied that the matter was \"under serious and\r\nanxious consideration,\" to which, on September 5, in a long\r\ncommunication, Adams wrote that if the Rams escaped: \"It would be\r\nsuperfluous in me to point out to your Lordship that this is war.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase was carefully chosen to permit a denial of a threat of war on\r\nthe explanation that Great Britain would herself be participating in the\r\nwar. There is no question that at the moment Adams thought Russell's\r\n\"change of policy\" of April was now thrown overboard, but the fact was\r\nthat on September 1, Russell had already given directions to take steps\r\nfor the detention of the Rams and that on September 3, positive\r\ninstructions were given to that effect[1024], though not carried out\r\nuntil some days later. There had been no alteration in the \"new policy\"\r\nof April; the whole point of the delay was governmental anxiety to\r\nsecure evidence sufficient to convict and thus to avoid attack for\r\nacting in contradiction to those principles which had been declared to\r\nbe the compelling principles of non-interference in the case of the\r\n_Alabama_. But so perfect were the arrangements of Captain Bullock that\r\ncomplete evidence was not procurable and Russell was forced, finally, to\r\nact without it[1025].\r\n\r\nIt would appear from a letter written by Russell to Palmerston, on\r\nSeptember 3, the day on which he gave the order to stop, that no Cabinet\r\napproval for this step had yet formally been given, since Russell\r\nnotified Palmerston of his purpose and asked the latter, if he\r\ndisapproved, to call a Cabinet at once[1026]. The _plan_ to stop the\r\nRams must have long been understood for Palmerston called no Cabinet.\r\nMoreover it is to be presumed that he was preparing the public for the\r\nseizure, for on this same September 3, the _Times_, in a long editorial,\r\nargued that the law as it stood (or was interpreted), was not in harmony\r\nwith true neutrality, and pointed out future dangers to British\r\ncommerce, as had the Liverpool ship-owners. Delane of the _Times_ was at\r\nthis period especially close to Palmerston, and it is at least\r\ninferential that the editorial was an advance notice of governmental\r\nintention to apply a policy known in intimate circles to have been for\r\nsome time matured. Four days later, while governmental action was still\r\nunknown to the public another editorial advocated seizure of the\r\nRams[1027]. Russell had acted under the fear that one of the Rams might\r\nslip away as had the _Alabama_; he had sent orders to stop and\r\ninvestigate, but he delayed final seizure in the hope that better\r\nevidence might yet be secured, conducting a rapid exchange of letters\r\nwith Lairds (the builders), seeking to get admissions from them. It was\r\nonly on September 9 that Lairds was officially ordered not to send the\r\nvessels on a \"trial trip,\" and it was not until September 16 that public\r\nannouncement was made of the Government's action[1028].\r\n\r\nRussell has been regarded as careless and thoughtless in that it was not\r\nuntil September 8 he relieved Adams' mind by assuring him the Rams would\r\nbe seized, even though three days before, on September 5, this\r\ninformation had been sent to Washington. The explanation is Russell's\r\neager search for evidence to _convict_, and his correspondence with\r\nLairds which did not come to a head until the eighth, when the builders\r\nrefused to give information. To the builders Russell was writing as if a\r\ngovernmental decision had not yet been reached. He could take no chance\r\nof a \"leak\" through the American Minister. Once informed, Adams was well\r\nsatisfied though his immediate reaction was to criticize, not Russell,\r\nbut the general \"timidity and vacillation\" of the law officers of the\r\nCrown[1029]. Two days later, having learned from Russell himself just\r\nwhat was taking place, Adams described the \"firm stand\" taken by the\r\nForeign Secretary, noted the general approval by the public press and\r\nexpressed the opinion that there was now a better prospect of being able\r\nto preserve friendly relations with England than at any time since his\r\narrival in London[1030]. Across the water British officials were\r\ndelighted with the seizure of the Rams. Monck in Canada expressed his\r\napproval[1031]. Lyons reported a \"great improvement\" in the feeling\r\ntoward England and that Seward especially was highly pleased with\r\nRussell's expressions, conveyed privately, of esteem for Seward together\r\nwith the hope that he would remain in office[1032].\r\n\r\nThe actual governmental seizure of the Rams did not occur until\r\nmid-October, though they had been placed under official surveillance on\r\nSeptember 9. Both sides were jockeying for position in the expected\r\nlegal battle when the case should be taken up by the courts[1033]. At\r\nfirst Russell even thought of making official protest to Mason in London\r\nand a draft of such protest was prepared, approved by the Law Officers\r\nand subsequently revised by Palmerston, but finally was not sent[1034].\r\nPossibly it was thought that such a communication to Mason approached\r\ntoo nearly a recognition of him in his desired official capacity, for in\r\nDecember the protest ultimately directed to be made through\r\nConsul-General Crawford at Havana, instructed him to go to Richmond and\r\nafter stating very plainly that he was in no way recognizing the\r\nConfederacy to present the following:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears from various correspondence the authenticity of\r\n     which cannot be doubted, that the Confederate Government\r\n     having no good ports free from the blockade of the Federals\r\n     have conceived the design of using the ports of the United\r\n     Kingdom for the purpose of constructing ships of war to be\r\n     equipped and armed to serve as cruisers against the commerce\r\n     of the United States of America, a State with which Her\r\n     Majesty is at peace....\"\r\n\r\n     \"These acts are inconsistent with the respect and comity\r\n     which ought to be shewn by a belligerent towards a\r\n     Neutral Power.\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty has declared her Neutrality and means strictly\r\n     to observe it.\r\n\r\n     \"You will therefore call upon Mr. Benjamin to induce his\r\n     Government to forbear from all acts tending to affect\r\n     injuriously Her Majesty's position[1035].\"\r\n\r\nTo carry out this instruction there was required permission for Crawford\r\nto pass through the blockade but Seward refused this when Lyons made the\r\nrequest[1036].\r\n\r\nNot everyone in Britain, however, approved the Government's course in\r\nseizing the Rams. Legal opinion especially was very generally against\r\nthe act. Adams now pressed either for an alteration of the British law\r\nor for a convention with America establishing mutual similar\r\ninterpretation of neutral duty. Russell replied that \"until the trials\r\nof the _Alexandra_ and the steam rams had taken place, we could hardly\r\nbe said to know what our law was, and therefore not tell whether it\r\nrequired alteration. I said, however, that he might assure Mr. Seward\r\nthat the wish and intention of Government were to make our neutrality an\r\nhonest and bona-fide one[1037].\" But save from extreme and avowed\r\nSouthern sympathizers criticism of the Government was directed less to\r\nthe stoppage of the Rams than to attacks of a political character,\r\nattempting to depict the weakness of the Foreign Minister and his\r\nhumiliation of Great Britain in having \"yielded to American threats.\"\r\nThus, February II, 1864, after the reassembling of Parliament, a party\r\nattack was made on Russell and the Government by Derby in the House of\r\nLords. Derby approved the stopping of the Rams but sought to prove that\r\nthe Government had dishonoured England by failing to act of its own\r\nvolition until threatened by America. He cited Seward's despatch of July\r\nII with much unction, that despatch now having appeared in the printed\r\nAmerican diplomatic correspondence with no indication that it was not an\r\ninstruction at once communicated to Russell. The attack fell flat for\r\nRussell simply replied that Adams had never presented such an\r\ninstruction. This forced Derby to seek other ground and on February 15\r\nhe returned to the matter, now seeking to show by the dates of various\r\ndocuments that \"at the last moment\" Adams made a threat of war and\r\nRussell had yielded. Again Russell's reply was brief and to the effect\r\nthat orders to stop the Rams had been given before the communications\r\nfrom Adams were received. Finally, on February 23, a motion in the\r\nCommons called for all correspondence with Adams and with Lairds, The\r\nGovernment consented to the first but refused that with Lairds and was\r\nsupported by a vote of 187 to 153.[1038]\r\n\r\nBeginning with an incautious personal and petty criticism of Russell the\r\nTories had been driven to an attempt to pass what was virtually a vote\r\nof censure on the Ministry yet they were as loud as was the Government\r\nin praise of Adams and in approval of the seizure of the Rams. Naturally\r\ntheir cause was weakened, and the Ministry, referring to expressions\r\nmade and intentions indicated as far back as March, 1863, thus hinting\r\nwithout directly so stating that the real decision had then been made,\r\nwas easily the victor in the vote[1038]. Derby had committed an error as\r\na party leader and the fault rankled for again in April, 1864, he\r\nattempted to draw Russell into still further discussion on dates of\r\ndocuments. Russell's reply ignored that point altogether[1039]. It did\r\nnot suit his purpose to declare, flatly, the fact that in April\r\nassurances had been given both to Adams and through Lyons to Seward,\r\nthat measures would be taken to prevent the departure of Southern\r\nvessels from British ports. To have made this disclosure would have\r\nrequired an explanation _why_ such assurance had been given and this\r\nwould have revealed the effect on both Russell and Lyons of the Northern\r\nplan to create a _cruising squadron blockade by privateers_. _There_ was\r\nthe real threat. The later delays and seeming uncertainties of British\r\naction made Adams anxious but there is no evidence that Russell ever\r\nchanged his purpose. He sought stronger evidence before acting and he\r\nhoped for stronger support from legal advisers, but he kept an eye on\r\nthe Rams and when they had reached the stage where there was danger of\r\nescape, he seized them even though the desired evidence was still\r\nlacking[1040]. Seward's \"privateering bill\" plan possibly entered upon\r\nin a moment of desperation and with no clear statement from him of its\r\nexact application had, as the anxiety of British diplomats became\r\npronounced, been used with skill to permit, if not to state, the\r\ninterpretation they placed upon it, and the result had been the\r\ncessation of that inadequate neutrality of which America complained.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 966: In other respects, also, this question of belligerent\r\nship-building and equipping in neutral ports was, in practice, vaguely\r\ndefined. As late as 1843 in the then existing Texan war of independence\r\nagainst Mexico, the British Foreign Secretary, Aberdeen, had been all at\r\nsea. Mexico made a contract for two ships of war with the English firm\r\nof Lizardi & Company. The crews were to be recruited in England, the\r\nships were to be commanded by British naval officers on leave, and the\r\nguns were to be purchased from firms customarily supplying the British\r\nNavy. Aberdeen advised the Admiralty to give the necessary authority to\r\npurchase guns. When Texas protested he at first seemed to think strict\r\nneutrality was secured if the same privileges were offered that country.\r\nLater he prohibited naval officers to go in command. One Mexican vessel,\r\nthe _Guadaloupe_, left England with full equipment as originally\r\nplanned; the other, the _Montezuma_, was forced to strip her equipment.\r\nBut both vessels sailed under British naval officers for these were\r\npermitted to resign their commissions. They were later reinstated. In\r\nall this there was in part a temporary British policy to aid Mexico, but\r\nit is also clear that British governmental opinion was much in confusion\r\nas to neutral duty in the case of such ships.

The plan was\r\nto have the fleet attack enemy commerce. The idea of aid to the North\r\nwas \"born on American soil,\" and Russian officers naturally did nothing\r\nto contradict its spread. In one case, however, a Russian commander was\r\nready to help the North. Rear-Admiral Papov with six vessels in the\r\nharbour of San Francisco was appealed to by excited citizens on rumours\r\nof the approach of the _Alabama_ and gave orders to protect the city.

An\r\ninteresting, if somewhat irrational and irregular plan to thwart\r\nSouthern ship-building operations, had been taken up by the United\r\nStates Navy Department. This was to buy the Rams outright by the offer\r\nof such a price as, it was thought, would be so tempting to the Lairds\r\nas to make refusal unlikely. Two men, Forbes and Aspinwall, were sent to\r\nEngland with funds and much embarrassed Adams to whom they discreetly\r\nrefrained from stating details, but yet permitted him to guess their\r\nobject. The plan of buying ran wholly counter to Adams' diplomatic\r\nprotests on England's duty in international law and the agents\r\nthemselves soon saw the folly of it. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the\r\nNavy, wrote to Dupont, March 26, 1863: \"The Confederate ironclads in\r\nEngland, I think, will be taken care of.\" (Correspondence, I, 196.)\r\nThurlow Weed wrote to Bigelow, April 16, of the purpose of the visit of\r\nForbes and Aspinwall. (Bigelow, _Retrospections_, I, 632.) Forbes\r\nreported as early as April 18 virtually against going on with the plan.\r\n\"We must keep cool here, and prepare the way; we have put new fire into\r\nMr. Dudley by furnishing _fuel_, and he is hard at it getting\r\nevidence.... My opinion _to-day_ is that we can and shall stop by legal\r\nprocess and by the British Government the sailing of ironclads and other\r\nwar-ships.\" (Forbes MS. To Fox.) That this was wholly a Navy Department\r\nplan and was disliked by State Department representatives is shown by\r\nDudley's complaints (Forbes MS.). The whole incident has been adequately\r\ndiscussed by C.F. Adams, though without reference to the preceding\r\ncitations, in his _Studies Military and Diplomatic_, Ch.

In my view the failure to push the case to a conclusion was due\r\nto the desire not to commit Great Britain on legal questions, in view of\r\nthe claim for damages certain to be set up by the United States on\r\naccount of the depredations of the _Alabama_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nROEBUCK'S MOTION\r\n\r\nIn the mid-period during which the British Government was seeking to\r\nfulfil its promise of an altered policy as regards ship-building and\r\nwhile the public was unaware that such a promise had been given, certain\r\nextreme friends of the South thought the time had come for renewed\r\npressure upon the Government, looking toward recognition of the\r\nConfederacy. The _Alexandra_ had been seized in April, but the first\r\ntrial, though appealed, had gone against the Government in June, and\r\nthere was no knowledge that the Ministry was determined in its stand.\r\nFrom January to the end of March, 1863, the public demonstrations in\r\napproval of the emancipation proclamation had somewhat checked\r\nexpressions of Southern sympathy, but by the month of June old friends\r\nhad recovered their courage and a new champion of the South came forward\r\nin the person of Roebuck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the activities of Southern agents and Southern friends had not\r\nceased even if they had, for a time, adopted a less vigorous tone. For\r\nfour months after the British refusal of Napoleon's overtures on\r\nmediation, in November, 1862, the friends of the South were against\r\n\"acting now,\" but this did not imply that they thought the cause lost or\r\nin any sense hopeless. Publicists either neutral in attitude or even\r\nprofessedly sympathetic with the North could see no outcome of the Civil\r\nWar save separation of North and South. Thus the historian Freeman in\r\nthe preface to the first volume of his uncompleted _History of Federal\r\nGovernment_, published in 1863, carefully explained that his book did\r\nnot have its origin in the struggle in America, and argued that the\r\nbreaking up of the Union in no way proved any inherent weakness in a\r\nfederal system, but took it for granted that American reunion was\r\nimpossible. The novelist, Anthony Trollope, after a long tour of the\r\nNorth, beginning in September, 1861, published late in 1862 a two-volume\r\nwork, _North America_, descriptive of a nation engaged in the business\r\nof war and wholly sympathetic with the Northern cause. Yet he, also,\r\ncould see no hope of forcing the South back into the Union. \"The North\r\nand South are virtually separated, and the day will come in which the\r\nWest also will secede[1041].\"\r\n\r\nSuch interpretations of conditions in America were not unusual; they\r\nwere, rather, generally accepted. The Cabinet decision in November,\r\n1862, was not regarded as final, though events were to prove it to be so\r\nfor never again was there so near an approach to British intervention.\r\nMason's friend, Spence, early began to think that true Southern policy\r\nwas now to make an appeal to the Tories against the Government. In\r\nJanuary, 1863, he was planning a new move:\r\n\r\n     \"I have written to urge Mr. Gregory to be here in time for a\r\n     thorough organization so as to push the matter this time to a\r\n     vote. I think the Conservatives may be got to move as a body\r\n     and if so the result of a vote seems to me very certain. I\r\n     have seen Mr. Horsfall and Mr. Laird here and will put myself\r\n     in communication with Mr. Disraeli as the time approaches for\r\n     action for this seems to me now our best card[1042].\"\r\n\r\nThat some such effort was being thought of is evidenced by the attitude\r\nof the _Index_ which all through the months from November, 1862, to the\r\nmiddle of January, 1863, had continued to harp on the subject of\r\nmediation as if still believing that something yet might be done by the\r\nexisting Ministry, but which then apparently gave up hope of the\r\nPalmerstonian administration:\r\n\r\n     \"But what the Government means is evident enough. It does not\r\n     mean to intervene or to interfere. It will not mediate, if it\r\n     can help it; it will not recognize the Confederate States,\r\n     unless there should occur some of those 'circumstances over\r\n     which they have no control,' which leave weak men and weak\r\n     ministers no choice. They will not, if they are not forced to\r\n     it, quarrel with Mr. Seward, or with Mr. Bright. They will\r\n     let Lancashire starve; they will let British merchantmen be\r\n     plundered off Nassau and burnt off Cuba; they will submit to\r\n     a blockade of Bermuda or of Liverpool; but they will do\r\n     nothing which may tend to bring a supply of cotton from the\r\n     South, or to cut off the supply of eggs and bacon from the\r\n     North[1043].\"\r\n\r\nBut this plan of 'turning to the Tories' received scant encouragement\r\nand was of no immediate promise, as soon appeared by the debate in\r\nParliament on reassembling, February 5, 1863. Derby gave explicit\r\napproval of the Government's refusal to listen to Napoleon[1044]. By\r\nFebruary, Russell, having recovered from the smart of defeat within the\r\nCabinet, declared himself weary of the perpetual talk about mediation\r\nand wrote to Lyons, \"... till both parties are heartily tired and sick\r\nof the business, I see no use in talking of good offices. When that time\r\ncomes Mercier will probably have a hint; let him have all the honour and\r\nglory of being the first[1045].\" For the time being Spence's idea was\r\nlaid aside, Gregory writing in response to an inquiry from Mason:\r\n\r\n     \"The House of Commons is opposed to taking any step at\r\n     present, feeling rightly or wrongly that to do so would be\r\n     useless to the South, and possibly embroil us with the North.\r\n     Any motion on the subject will be received with disfavour,\r\n     consequently the way in which it will be treated will only\r\n     make the North more elated, and will irritate the South\r\n     against us. If I saw the slightest chance of a motion being\r\n     received with any favour I would not let it go into other\r\n     hands, but I find the most influential men of all Parties\r\n     opposed to it[1046].\"\r\n\r\nOf like opinion was Slidell who, writing of the situation in France,\r\nreported that he had been informed by his \"friend at the Foreign Office\"\r\nthat \"It is believed that every possible thing has been done here in\r\nyour behalf--we must now await the action of England, and it is through\r\nthat you must aim all your efforts in that direction[1047].\"\r\n\r\nWith the failure, at least temporary, of Southern efforts to move the\r\nBritish Government or to stir Parliament, energies were now directed\r\ntoward using financial methods of winning support for the Southern\r\ncause. The \"Confederate Cotton Loan\" was undertaken with the double\r\nobject of providing funds for Southern agents in Europe and of creating\r\nan interested support of the South, which might, it was hoped,\r\nultimately influence the British Government.\r\n\r\nBy 1863 it had become exceedingly difficult, owing to the blockade, for\r\nthe Government at Richmond to transmit funds to its agents abroad.\r\nBullock, especially, required large amounts in furtherance of his\r\nship-building contracts and was embarrassed by the lack of business\r\nmethods and the delays of the Government at home. The incompetence of\r\nthe Confederacy in finance was a weakness that characterized all of its\r\nmany operations whether at home or abroad[1048] and was made evident in\r\nEngland by the confusion in its efforts to establish credits there. At\r\nfirst the Confederate Government supplied its agents abroad with drafts\r\nupon the house of Fraser, Trenholm & Company, of Liverpool, a branch of\r\nthe firm long established at Charleston, South Carolina, purchasing its\r\nbills of exchange with its own \"home made\" money. But as Confederate\r\ncurrency rapidly depreciated this method of transmitting funds became\r\nincreasingly difficult and costly. The next step was to send to Spence,\r\nnominated by Mason as financial adviser in England, Confederate money\r\nbonds for sale on the British market, with authority to dispose of them\r\nas low as fifty cents on the dollar, but these found no takers[1049]. By\r\nSeptember, 1862, Bullock's funds for ship-building were exhausted and\r\nsome new method of supply was required. Temporary relief was found in\r\nadopting a suggestion from Lindsay whereby cotton was made the basis for\r\nan advance of £60,000, a form of cotton bond being devised which fixed\r\nthe price of cotton at eightpence the pound. These bonds were not put on\r\nthe market but were privately placed by Lindsay & Company with a few\r\nbuyers for the entire sum, the transaction remaining secret[1050].\r\n\r\nIn the meantime this same recourse to cotton had occurred to the\r\nauthorities at Richmond and a plan formulated by which cotton should be\r\npurchased by the Government, stored, and certificates issued to be sold\r\nabroad, the purchaser being assured of \"all facilities of shipment.\"\r\nSpence was to be the authorized agent for the sale of these \"cotton\r\ncertificates,\" but before any reached him various special agents of the\r\nConfederacy had arrived in England by December, 1862, with such\r\ncertificates in their possession and had disposed of some of them,\r\ncalling them \"cotton warrants.\" The difficulties which might arise from\r\nseparate action in the market were at once perceived and following a\r\nconference with Mason all cotton obligations were turned to Fraser,\r\nTrenholm & Company. Spence now had in his hands the \"money bonds\" but no\r\nfurther attempt was made to dispose of these since the \"cotton warrants\"\r\nwere considered a better means of raising funds.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that since all of these efforts involved a\r\ngovernmental guarantee the various \"certificates\" or \"warrants\" partook\r\nof the nature of a government bond. Yet up to this point the Richmond\r\nauthorities, after the first failure to sell \"money bonds\" abroad were\r\nnot keen to attempt anything that could be stamped as a foreign\r\n\"government loan.\" Their idea was rather that a certain part of the\r\nproduce of the South was being set aside as the property of those who in\r\nEngland should extend credit to the South. The sole purpose of these\r\nearlier operations was to provide funds for Southern agents. By July,\r\n1862, Bullock had exhausted his earlier credit of a million dollars. The\r\n£60,000 loan secured through Lindsay then tided over an emergency demand\r\nand this had been followed by a development on similar lines of the\r\n\"cotton certificates\" and \"warrants\" which by December, 1862, had\r\nsecured, through Spence's agency, an additional million dollars or\r\nthereabouts. Mason was strongly recommending further expansion of this\r\nmethod and had the utmost confidence in Spence. Now, however, there was\r\nbroached to the authorities in Richmond a proposal for the definite\r\nfloating in Europe of a specified \"cotton loan.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal came through Slidell at Paris and was made by the\r\nwell-established firm of Erlanger & Company. First approached by this\r\ncompany in September, 1862, Slidell consulted Mason but found the latter\r\nstrongly committed to his own plans with Spence[1051]. But Slidell\r\npersisted and Mason gave way[1052]. Representatives of Erlanger\r\nproceeded to Richmond and proposed a loan of twenty-five million\r\ndollars; they were surprised to find the Confederate Government\r\ndisinclined to the idea of a foreign loan, and the final agreement, cut\r\nto fifteen millions, was largely made because of the argument advanced\r\nthat as a result powerful influences would thus be brought to the\r\nsupport of the South[1053]. The contract was signed at Richmond, January\r\n28, 1863, and legalized by a secret act of Congress on the day\r\nfollowing[1054]. But there was no Southern enthusiasm for the project.\r\nBenjamin wrote to Mason that the Confederacy disclaimed the \"desire or\r\nintention on our part to effect a loan in Europe ... during the war we\r\nwant only such very moderate sums as are required abroad for the\r\npurchase of warlike supplies and for vessels, and even that is not\r\nrequired because of our want of funds, but because of the difficulties\r\nof remittance\"; as for the Erlanger contract the Confederacy \"would have\r\ndeclined it altogether but for the political considerations indicated by\r\nMr. Slidell[1055]....\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mason's view-point the prime need was to secure money; from\r\nSlidell's (at least so asserted) it was to place a loan with the purpose\r\nof establishing strong friends. It had been agreed to suspend the\r\noperations of Spence until the result of Erlanger's offer was learned,\r\nbut pressure brought by Caleb Huse, purchasing agent of the Confederacy,\r\ncaused a further sale of \"cotton warrants[1056].\" Spence, fearing he was\r\nabout to be shelved, became vexed and made protest to Mason, while\r\nSlidell regarded Spence[1057] as a weak and meddlesome agent[1058]. But\r\non February 14, 1863, Erlanger's agents returned to Paris and\r\nuncertainty was at an end. Spence went to Paris, saw Erlanger, and\r\nagreed to co-operate in floating the loan[1059]. Then followed a\r\nremarkable bond market operation, interesting, not so much as regards\r\nthe financial returns to the South, for these were negligible, as in\r\nrelation to the declared object of Slidell and the Richmond\r\nGovernment--namely, the \"strong influences\" that would accompany the\r\nsuccessful flotation of a loan.\r\n\r\nDelay in beginning operations was caused by the failure to receive\r\npromptly the authenticated copy of the Act of Congress authorizing the\r\nloan, which did not arrive until March 18. By this contract Erlanger &\r\nCompany, sole managers of the loan, had guaranteed flotation of the\r\nentire $15,000,000 at not less than 77, the profit of the Company to be\r\nfive per cent., plus the difference between 77 and the actual price\r\nreceived, but the first $300,000 taken was to be placed at once at the\r\ndisposal of the Government. The bonds were put on the market March 19,\r\nin London, Liverpool, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, but practically\r\nall operations were confined to England. The bid for the loan was\r\nentitled \"_Seven per Cent. Cotton Loan of the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica for_ 3 _Millions Sterling at_ 90 _per Cent_.\" The bonds were to\r\nbear interest at seven per cent. and were to be exchangeable for cotton\r\nat the option of the holder at the price of sixpence \"for each pound of\r\ncotton, at any time not later than six months after the ratification of\r\na treaty of peace between the present belligerents.\" There were\r\nprovisions for the gradual redemption of the bonds in gold for those who\r\ndid not desire cotton. Subscribers were to pay 5 per cent. on\r\napplication. 10 per cent. on allotment, 10 per cent. on each of the\r\ndays, the first of May, June and July, 1863, and 15 per cent. on the\r\nfirst of August, September and October.\r\n\r\nSince the price of cotton in England was then 21 pence per pound it was\r\nthought here was a sufficiently wide margin to offer at least a good\r\nchance of enormous profits to the buyer of the bonds. True \"the loan was\r\nlooked upon as a wild cotton speculation[1060],\" but odds were so large\r\nas to induce a heavy gamblers' plunge, for it seemed hardly conceivable\r\nthat cotton could for some years go below sevenpence per pound, and even\r\nthat figure would have meant profit, _if_ the Confederacy were\r\nestablished. Moreover, even though the loan was not given official\r\nrecognition by the London stock exchange, the financial columns of the\r\n_Times_ and the _Economist_ favoured it and the subscriptions were so\r\nprompt and so heavy that in two days the loan was reported as\r\nover-subscribed three times in London alone[1061]. With the closing of\r\nthe subscription the bonds went up to 95-1/2. Slidell wrote: \"It is a\r\nfinancial recognition of our independence, emanating from a class\r\nproverbially cautious, and little given to be influenced by sentiment or\r\nsympathy[1062].\" On Friday, March 27, the allotment took place and three\r\ndays later Mason wrote, \"I think I may congratulate you, therefore, on\r\nthe triumphant success of our infant credit--it shows, _malgré_ all\r\ndetraction and calumny, that cotton is king at last[1063].\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas for the King! Two days later his throne began to tremble and it\r\ntook all the King's horses and all the King's men to keep him in\r\nstate[1064].\" On April 1, the flurry of speculation had begun to falter\r\nand the loan was below par; on the second it dropped to 3-1/2 discount,\r\nand by the third the promoters and the Southern diplomats were very\r\nanxious. They agreed that someone must be \"bearing\" the bonds and\r\nsuspected Adams of supplying Northern funds for that purpose[1065].\r\nSpence wrote from Liverpool in great alarm and coincidently Erlanger &\r\nCompany urged that Mason should authorize the use of the receipts\r\nalready secured to hold up the price of the bonds. Mason was very\r\nreluctant to do this[1066], but finally yielded when informed of the\r\nresult of an interview between Spence, Erlanger, and the latter's chief\r\nLondon agent, Schroeder. Spence had proposed a withdrawal of a part of\r\nthe loan from the market as likely to have a stabilizing effect, and\r\nopposed the Erlanger plan of using the funds already in hand. But\r\nSchroeder coolly informed him that if the Confederate representative\r\nrefused to authorize the use of these funds to sustain the market,\r\nthen Erlanger would regard his Company as having \"completed their\r\ncontract ... which was simply to issue the Loan.\" \"Having issued it,\r\nthey did not and do not guarantee that the public would pay up their\r\ninstalments. If the public abandon the loan, the 15 per cent sacrificed\r\nis, in point of fact, not the property of the Government at all, but the\r\nprofits of Messrs. Erlanger & Co., actually in their hands, and they\r\ncannot be expected to take a worse position. At any rate they will not\r\ndo so, and unless the compact can be made on the basis we name, matters\r\nmust take their course[1067].\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of this ultimatum, Spence advised yielding as he \"could not\r\nhesitate ... seeing that nothing could be so disastrous politically, as\r\nwell as financially, as the public break-down of the Loan[1068].\" Mason\r\ngave the required authorization and this was later approved from\r\nRichmond. For a time the \"bulling\" of the loan was successful, but again\r\nand again required the use of funds received from actual sales of bonds\r\nand in the end the loan netted very little to the Confederacy. Some\r\n$6,000,000 was squandered in supporting the market and from the entire\r\noperation it is estimated that less than $7,000,000 was realized by the\r\nConfederacy, although, as stated by the _Economist_, over $12,000,000 of\r\nthe bonds were outstanding and largely in the hands of British investors\r\nat the end of the war[1069].\r\n\r\nThe loan soon became, not as had been hoped and prophesied by Slidell,\r\na source of valuable public support, but rather a mere barometer of\r\nSouthern fortunes[1070]. From first to last the Confederate Cotton Loan\r\nbore to subscribers the aspect of a speculative venture and lacked the\r\nregard attached to sound investment. This fact in itself denied to the\r\nloan any such favourable influence, or \"financial recognition of the\r\nConfederacy,\" as Mason and Slidell, in the first flush of success,\r\nattributed to it. The rapid fluctuations in price further discredited it\r\nand tended to emphasize the uncertainty of Southern victory. Thus\r\n\"confidence in the South\" was, if anything, lessened instead of\r\nincreased by this turning from political to financial methods of\r\nbringing pressure upon the Government[1071].\r\n\r\nSouthern political and parliamentary pressure had indeed been reserved\r\nfrom January to June, 1863. Public attention was distracted from the war\r\nin America by the Polish question, which for a time, particularly during\r\nthe months of March and April, 1863, disturbed the good relations\r\nexisting between England and France since the Emperor seemed bent on\r\ngoing beyond British \"meddling,\" even to pursuing a policy that easily\r\nmight lead to war with Russia. Europe diverted interest from America,\r\nand Napoleon himself was for the moment more concerned over the Polish\r\nquestion than with American affairs, even though the Mexican venture was\r\nstill a worry to him. It was no time for a British parliamentary \"push\"\r\nand when a question was raised on the cotton famine in Lancashire\r\nlittle attention was given it, though ordinarily it would have been\r\nseized upon as an opportunity for a pro-Southern demonstration. This was\r\na bitter attack by one Ferrand in the Commons, on April 27, directed\r\nagainst the cotton manufacturers as lukewarm over employees' sufferings.\r\nPotter, a leading cotton manufacturer, replied to the attack. Potter and\r\nhis brother were already prominent as strong partisans of the North, yet\r\nno effort was made to use the debate to the advantage of the\r\nSouth[1072].\r\n\r\nIn late May both necessity and fortuitous circumstance seemed to make\r\nadvisable another Southern effort in Parliament. The cotton loan, though\r\nfairly strong again because of Confederate governmental aid, was in fact\r\na failure in its expected result of public support for the South;\r\nsomething must be done to offset that failure. In Polish affairs France\r\nhad drawn back; presumably Napoleon was again eager for some active\r\neffort. Best of all, the military situation in America was thought to\r\nindicate Southern success; Grant's western campaign had come to a halt\r\nwith the stubborn resistance of the great Mississippi stronghold at\r\nVicksburg, while in Virginia, Lee, on May 2-3, had overwhelmingly\r\ndefeated Hooker at Chancellorsville and was preparing, at last, a\r\ndefinite offensive campaign into Northern territory. Lee's advance north\r\ndid not begin until June 10, but his plan was early known in a select\r\ncircle in England and much was expected of it. The time seemed ripe,\r\ntherefore, and the result was notification by Roebuck of a motion for\r\nthe recognition of the Confederacy--first step the real purpose of which\r\nwas to attempt that 'turning to the Tories' which had been advocated by\r\nSpence in January, but postponed on the advice of Gregory[1073]. _The\r\nIndex_ clearly indicated where lay the wind: \"No one,\" it declared \"now\r\nasks what will be the policy of Great Britain towards America; but\r\neverybody anxiously waits on what the Emperor of the French will do.\"\r\n\r\n     \"... England to-day pays one of the inevitable penalties of\r\n     free government and of material prosperity, that of having at\r\n     times at the head of national affairs statesmen who belong\r\n     rather to the past than to the present, and whose skill and\r\n     merit are rather the business tact and knowledge of details,\r\n     acquired by long experience, than the quick and prescient\r\n     comprehension of the requirements of sudden emergencies....\r\n\r\n     \"The nominal conduct of Foreign Affairs is in the hands of a\r\n     diplomatic Malaprop, who has never shown vigour, activity, or\r\n     determination, except where the display of these qualities\r\n     was singularly unneeded, or even worse than useless.... From\r\n     Great Britain, then, under her actual Government, the Cabinet\r\n     at Washington has nothing to fear, and the Confederate States\r\n     nothing to expect[1074].\"\r\n\r\nOf main interest to the public was the military situation. The _Times_\r\nminimized the western campaigns, regarding them as required for\r\npolitical effect to hold the north-western states loyal to the Union,\r\nand while indulging in no prophecies as to the fate of Vicksburg,\r\nexpressing the opinion that, if forced to surrender it, the South could\r\neasily establish \"a new Vicksburg\" at some other point[1075]. Naturally\r\n_The Index_ was pleased with and supported this view[1076]. Such\r\nignorance of the geographic importance of Vicksburg may seem like wilful\r\nmisleading of the public; but professed British military experts were\r\nequally ignorant. Captain Chesney, Professor of Military History at\r\nSandhurst College, published in 1863, an analysis of American campaigns,\r\ncentering all attention on the battles in Maryland and Virginia and\r\nreaching the conclusion that the South could resist, indefinitely, any\r\nNorthern attack[1077]. He dismissed the western campaigns as of no real\r\nsignificance. W.H. Russell, now editor of the _Army and Navy Gazette_,\r\nbetter understood Grant's objectives on the Mississippi but believed\r\nNorthern reconquest of the South to the point of restoration of the\r\nUnion to be impossible. If, however, newspaper comments on the success\r\nof Southern armies were to be regarded as favourable to Roebuck's motion\r\nfor recognition, W.H. Russell was against it.\r\n\r\n     \"If we could perceive the smallest prospect of awaking the\r\n     North to the truth, or of saving the South from the loss and\r\n     trials of the contest by recognition, we would vote for it\r\n     to-morrow. But next to the delusion of the North that it can\r\n     breathe the breath of life into the corpse of the murdered\r\n     Union again, is the delusion of some people in England who\r\n     imagine that by recognition we would give life to the South,\r\n     divide the nations on each side of the black and white line\r\n     for ever, and bring this war to the end. There is probably\r\n     not one of these clamourers for recognition who could define\r\n     the limits of the State to be recognized.... And, over and\r\n     above all, recognition, unless it meant 'war,' would be an\r\n     aggravation of the horrors of the contest; it would not aid\r\n     the South one whit, and it would add immensely to the unity\r\n     and the fury of the North[1078].\"\r\n\r\nThe British Foreign Secretary was at first little concerned at Roebuck's\r\nmotion, writing to Lyons, \"You will see that Roebuck has given notice of\r\na motion to recognize the South. But I think it certain that neither\r\nLord Derby nor Cobden will support it, and I should think no great\r\nnumber of the Liberal party. Offshoots from all parties will compose the\r\nminority[1079].\" Russell was correct in this view but not so did it\r\nappear to Southern agents who now became active at the request of\r\nRoebuck and Lindsay in securing from the Emperor renewed expressions of\r\nwillingness to act, and promptly, if England would but give the word.\r\nThere was no real hope that Russell would change his policy, but there\r\nseemed at least a chance of replacing the Whig Ministry with a Tory one.\r\nThe date for the discussion of the motion had been set for June 30. On\r\nJune 13, Lindsay, writing to Slidell, enclosed a letter from Roebuck\r\nasking for an interview with Napoleon[1080], and on June 16, Mason wrote\r\nthat if Slidell saw the Emperor it was of the greatest importance that\r\nhe, Mason, should be at once informed of the results and how far he\r\nmight communicate them to \"our friends in the House[1081].\" Slidell saw\r\nthe Emperor on June 18, talked of the possibility of \"forcing the\r\nEnglish Cabinet to act or to give way to a new ministry,\" asked that an\r\ninterview be given Lindsay and Roebuck, and hinted that Lord Malmesbury,\r\na warm friend of the Emperor, would probably be the Foreign Secretary in\r\na Tory cabinet. Napoleon made no comment indicating any purpose to aid\r\nin upsetting the Palmerston Government; but consented to the requested\r\ninterview and declared he would go to the length of officially informing\r\nthe British Ministry that France was very ready to discuss the\r\nadvisability of recognizing the South[1082].\r\n\r\nThis was good news. June 22, Slidell received a note from Mocquard\r\nstating that Baron Gros, the French Ambassador at London, had been\r\ninstructed to sound Russell. Meanwhile, Roebuck and Lindsay had hurried\r\nto Paris, June 20, saw Napoleon and on the twenty-fifth, Slidell\r\nreported that they were authorized to state in the House of Commons that\r\nFrance was \"not only willing but anxious to recognize the Confederate\r\nStates with the co-operation of England[1083].\" Slidell added, however,\r\nthat Napoleon had not promised Roebuck and Lindsay to make a formal\r\nproposal to Great Britain. This rested on the assurances received by\r\nSlidell from Mocquard, and when Mason, who had let the assurance be\r\nknown to his friends, wrote that Russell, replying to Clanricarde, on\r\nJune 26, had denied any official communication from France, and asked\r\nfor authority from Slidell to back up his statements by being permitted\r\nto give Roebuck a copy of the supposed instruction[1084], he received a\r\nreply indicating confusion somewhere:\r\n\r\n     \"I called yesterday on my friend at the Affaires Etrangeres\r\n     on the subject of your note of Saturday: he has just left me.\r\n     M.D. de Lh. will not give a copy of his instructions to Baron\r\n     Gros--but this is the substance of it. On the 19th he\r\n     directed Baron Gros to take occasion to say to leading\r\n     Members of Parliament that the Emperor's opinions on the\r\n     subject of American affairs were unchanged. That he was\r\n     disposed with the co-operation of England immediately to\r\n     recognize the Confederate States; this was in the form of a\r\n     draft letter, not a despatch. On the 22nd, he officially\r\n     instructed the Baron to sound _Palmerston_ on the subject and\r\n     to inform him of the Emperor's views and wishes. This was\r\n     done in consequence of a note from the Emperor, to the\r\n     Minister, in which he said, 'Je me demande, s'il ne serait\r\n     bien d'avertir Lord Palmerston, que je suis décidé à\r\n     reconnaître le Sud.' This is by far the most significant\r\n     thing that the Emperor has said, either to me or to the\r\n     others. It renders me comparatively indifferent what England\r\n     may do or omit doing. At all events, let Mr. Roebuck press\r\n     his motion and make his statement of the Emperor's\r\n     declaration. Lord Palmerston will not dare to dispute it and\r\n     the responsibility of the continuance of the war will rest\r\n     entirely upon him. M. Drouyn de Lhuys has not heard from\r\n     Baron Gros the result of his interview with Palmerston. I\r\n     see that the latter has been unwell and it is probable that\r\n     the former had not been able to see him. There can be no\r\n     impropriety in Mr. Roebuck's seeing Baron Gros, who will\r\n     doubtless give him information which he will use to\r\n     advantage. I write in great haste; will you do me the favour\r\n     to let Lord Campbell know the substance of this note,\r\n     omitting that portion of it which relates to the Emperor's\r\n     inclination to act alone. Pray excuse me to Lord Campbell for\r\n     not writing to him, time not permitting me to do so[1085].\"\r\n\r\nThis did not satisfy Mason; he telegraphed on the twenty-ninth, \"Can I\r\nput in hands of Roebuck copy of Mocquard's note brought by\r\nCorcoran[1086].\" To which Slidell replied by letter:\r\n\r\n     \"For fear the telegraph may commit some blunder I write to\r\n     say that M. Mocquard's note, being confidential, cannot be\r\n     _used in any way_. I showed it to Messrs. Roebuck and Lindsay\r\n     when they were here and have no objection that they should\r\n     again see it confidentially[1087].\"\r\n\r\nOn June 29, Roebuck went to Baron Gros and received the information that\r\nno formal communication had been made to Russell. The next day in an\r\neffort in some way to secure an admission of what Mason and his friends\r\nbelieved to be the truth, Lord Campbell asked Russell in the House of\r\nLords if he had received either a document or a verbal communication\r\noutlining Napoleon's desires. Russell replied that Baron Gros had told\r\nhim \"an hour ago\" that he had not even received any instruction to\r\ndeliver such a communication[1088]. This was in the hours preceding the\r\ndebate, now finally to occur in the Commons. Evidently there had been an\r\nerror in the understanding of Napoleon by Slidell, Roebuck and Lindsay,\r\nor else there was a question of veracity between Russell, Baron Gros\r\nand Napoleon.\r\n\r\nRoebuck's motion was couched in the form of a request to the Queen to\r\nenter into negotiations with foreign powers for co-operation in\r\nrecognition of the Confederacy. Roebuck argued that the South had in\r\nfact established its independence and that this was greatly to England's\r\nadvantage since it put an end to the \"threatening great power\" in the\r\nWest. He repeated old arguments based on suffering in Lancashire--a\r\npoint his opponents brushed aside as no longer of dangerous\r\nconcern--attacked British anti-slavery sentiment as mere hypocrisy and\r\nminimized the dangers of a war with the North, prophesying an easy\r\nvictory for Great Britain. Then, warmed to the real attack on the\r\nGovernment Roebuck related at length his interview with Napoleon,\r\nclaiming to have been commissioned by the Emperor to urge England to\r\naction and asserting that since Baron Gros had been instructed to apply\r\nagain to the British Cabinet it must be evident that the Ministry was\r\nconcealing something from Parliament. Almost immediately, however, he\r\nadded that Napoleon had told him no formal French application could be\r\nrenewed to Great Britain since Russell had revealed to Seward, through\r\nLyons, the contents of a former application.\r\n\r\nThus following the usual pro-Southern arguments, now somewhat\r\nperfunctorily given, the bolt against the Government had been shot with\r\nall of Roebuck's accustomed \"vigour\" of utterance[1089]. Here was direct\r\nattack; that it was a futile one early became evident in the debate.\r\nLord Robert Montagu, while professing himself a friend of the South, was\r\nsarcastic at the expense of Roebuck's entrance into the field of\r\ndiplomacy, enlarged upon the real dangers of becoming involved in the\r\nwar, and moved an amendment in favour of continued British neutrality.\r\nPalmerston was absent, being ill, but Gladstone, for the Government,\r\nwhile carefully avoiding expressions of sympathy for either North or\r\nSouth, yet going out of his way to pass a moral judgment on the disaster\r\nto political liberty if the North should wholly crush the South, was\r\npositive in assertion that it would be unwise to adopt either Roebuck's\r\nmotion or Montagu's amendment. Great Britain should not _commit_ herself\r\nto any line of policy, especially as military events were \"now\r\noccurring\" which might greatly alter the whole situation, though \"the\r\nmain result of the contest was not doubtful.\" Here spoke that element of\r\nthe Ministry still convinced of ultimate Southern success.\r\n\r\nIf Gladstone's had been the only reply to Roebuck he and his friends\r\nmight well have thought they were about to secure a ministerial change\r\nof front. But it soon appeared that Gladstone spoke more for himself\r\nthan for the Government. Roebuck had made a direct accusation and in\r\nmeeting this, Layard, for the Foreign Office, entered a positive and\r\nemphatical denial, in which he was supported by Sir George Grey, Home\r\nSecretary, who added sharp criticism of Roebuck for permitting himself\r\nto be made the channel of a French complaint against England. It early\r\nbecame evident to the friends of the South that an error in tactics had\r\nbeen committed and in two directions; first, in the assertion that a new\r\nFrench offer had been made when it was impossible to present proof of\r\nit; and second, in bringing forward what amounted to an attempt to\r\nunseat the Ministry without previously committing the Tories to a\r\nsupport of the motion. Apparently Disraeli was simply letting Roebuck\r\n\"feel out\" the House. The only member of the Tory party strongly\r\nsupporting him was Lord Robert Cecil, in a speech so clearly a mere\r\nparty one that it served to increase the strength of ministerial\r\nresistance. Friends of the North quickly appreciated the situation and\r\nin strong speeches supported the neutrality policy of the Government.\r\nForster laid stress upon the danger of war and the strength of British\r\nemancipation sentiment as did Bright in what was, read to-day, the most\r\npowerful of all his parliamentary utterances on the American war. In\r\nparticular Bright voiced a general disbelief in the accuracy of\r\nRoebuck's report of his interview with Napoleon, called upon his\r\n\"friend\" Lindsay for his version[1090] of the affair, and concluded by\r\nrecalling former speeches by Roebuck in which the latter had been fond\r\nof talking about the \"perjured lips\" of Napoleon. Bright dilated upon\r\nthe egotism and insolence of Roebuck in trying to represent the Emperor\r\nof France on the floor of the House of Commons. The Emperor, he\r\nasserted, was in great danger of being too much represented in\r\nParliament[1091].\r\n\r\nThe result of this first day's debate on June 30 was disconcerting to\r\nSouthern friends. It had been adjourned without a vote, for which they\r\nwere duly thankful. Especially disconcerting was Slidell's refusal to\r\npermit the citation of Mocquard's note in proof of Roebuck's assertions.\r\nMason wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"I have your note of 29th ult. You will see in the papers of\r\n     to-day the debate in the House last night, at which I was\r\n     present, and will have seen what in the H.L. Lord Russell\r\n     said in reply to Lord Campbell. Thus the French affair\r\n     remains in a 'muss,' unless the Emperor will show his hand\r\n     _on paper_, we shall never know what he really means, or\r\n     derive any benefit from his private and individual\r\n     revelations. As things now stand before the public, there can\r\n     be but one opinion, i.e., that he holds one language in\r\n     private communications, though 'with liberty to divulge,'\r\n     and another to his ambassador here. The debate is adjourned\r\n     to to-morrow night, when Lindsay will give in his\r\n     explanation. It would be uncivil to say that I have no\r\n     confidence in the Emperor, but certainly what has come from\r\n     him so far can invite only distrust[1092].\"\r\n\r\nAs in Parliament, so in the public press, immediate recognition of the\r\nConfederacy received little support. The _Times_, while sympathetic with\r\nthe purpose was against Roebuck's motion, considering it of no value\r\nunless backed up by force; to this the _Times_ was decidedly\r\nopposed[1093]. Of like opinion was the _Economist_, declaring that\r\npremature recognition was a justifiable ground for a declaration of war\r\nby the North[1094]. July 2, Roebuck asked when the debate was to be\r\nrenewed and was told that must wait on Palmerston's recovery and return\r\nto the House. Bright pressed for an immediate decision. Layard\r\nreaffirmed very positively that no communication had been received from\r\nFrance and disclosed that Napoleon's alleged complaint of a British\r\nrevelation to Seward of French overtures was a myth, since the document\r\nin question had been printed in the _Moniteur_, thus attracting Seward's\r\nattention[1095]. Thus Roebuck was further discredited. July 4, Spence\r\nwrote strongly urging the withdrawal of the motion:\r\n\r\n     \"I have a letter from an eminent member of the House and\r\n     great friend of the South urging the danger of carrying Mr.\r\n     Roebuck's motion to a vote. It is plain it will be defeated\r\n     by a great majority and the effect of this will encourage the\r\n     North and distress our friends. It will also strengthen the\r\n     minority of the Cabinet in favour of the North....\r\n\r\n     \"The fact is the ground of the motion, which was action on\r\n     the part of France, has failed us--and taken shape which\r\n     tells injuriously instead of being the great support....\r\n\r\n     \"If a positive engagement were made by Mr. Disraeli to\r\n     support the motion it would alter the question entirely. In\r\n     the absence of this I fear the vote would be humiliating and\r\n     would convey an impression wholly delusive, for the members\r\n     are 10 to 1 in favour of the South and yet on this point the\r\n     vote might be 5 to 1 against Southern interests[1096].\"\r\n\r\nOn July 6, Palmerston was back in the House and Roebuck secured an\r\nagreement for a resumption of the debate on \"Monday next[1097].\"\r\nMeantime many powerful organs of the French press had taken up the\r\nmatter and were full of sharp criticism of Napoleon's supposed policy\r\nand actions as stated by Roebuck. The effect in England was to create a\r\nfeeling that Napoleon might have difficulty in carrying out a\r\npro-Southern policy[1098]. Palmerston, wishing to avoid further\r\ndiscussion on Napoleon's share in providing fuel for the debate, wrote\r\nin a very conciliatory and pleasant way to Roebuck, on July 9:\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps you will allow me thus privately to urge upon you,\r\n     and through you upon Mr. Lindsay, the expediency of dropping\r\n     altogether, whether your debate goes on or not, all further\r\n     mention or discussion of what passed between you and Mr.\r\n     Lindsay on the one hand, and the Emperor of the French on the\r\n     other. In truth the whole proceeding on this subject the\r\n     other day seems to me to have been very irregular. The\r\n     British Parliament receives messages and communications from\r\n     their own sovereign, but not from the sovereigns of other\r\n     countries....\"\r\n\r\n     \"No good can come of touching again upon this matter, nor\r\n     from fixing upon the Emperor a mistake which amid the\r\n     multiplicity of things he has to think of he may be excused\r\n     for making. I am very anxious that neither you nor Mr.\r\n     Lindsay should mention those matters any more, as any\r\n     discussion about them must tend to impair the good relations\r\n     between the French and English Governments. Might I ask you\r\n     to show this note to Mr. Lindsay, your fellow\r\n     traveller[1099].\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the Commons, Sir James Ferguson appealed to Roebuck to\r\nwithdraw his motion altogether as inexpedient, because of the\r\nuncertainty of events in America and as sure to be defeated if pressed\r\nto a vote. Palmerston approved this suggestion and urged that if the\r\ndebate be continued speakers should refrain from all further mention of\r\nthe personal questions that had been raised, since these were not proper\r\nmatters for discussion in the House and were embarrassing to the French\r\nEmperor. But Palmerston's skill in management was unavailing in this\r\ncase and the \"muss\" (as Mason called it) was continued when Lindsay\r\nentered upon a long account of the interview with Napoleon, renewed the\r\naccusations of Russell's \"revelations\" to Seward and advised Roebuck not\r\nto withdraw his motion but to postpone it \"until Monday.\" The _Scotia_,\r\nhe said was due and any moment news from America might change the\r\ngovernmental policy. Again the fat was in the fire. Palmerston sharply\r\ndisavowed that news would change policy. Kinglake thought Roebuck's\r\nactions should be thoroughly investigated. Forster eagerly pressed for\r\ncontinuation of the debate. There was a general criticism of Roebuck's\r\n\"diplomacy,\" and of Lindsay's also. Northern friends were jubilant and\r\nthose of the South embarrassed and uncertain. Gregory believed that the\r\nmotion should be withdrawn \"in the interest of the South,\" but Lord\r\nRobert Cecil renewed Lindsay's advice to wait \"until Monday\" and this\r\nwas finally done[1100].\r\n\r\nAll England was in fact eagerly waiting for news from America. Lee's\r\nadvance was known to have passed by Washington, but no reports were yet\r\nat hand of the battle which must determine this first great offensive\r\ncampaign by the South. July 9, the _Times_ predicted, editorially, that\r\nLee was about to capture Washington and that this event would be met by\r\na great cry of joy and relief in the North, now weary of the war and\r\neager to escape from the despotism of Lincoln's administration[1101].\r\nNevertheless the _Times_, while still confident of Lee's victorious\r\nadvance and of the welcome likely to be accorded him in the North, came\r\nout strongly on July 13 in an appeal to Roebuck to withdraw his motion,\r\narguing that even if he were successful Great Britain ought to make no\r\nhurried change of policy[1102]. On this day, the thirteenth, Roebuck\r\nmoved the discharge of his motion in a speech so mild as to leave the\r\nimpression that \"Tear 'em\" had his tail between his legs but, Lindsay,\r\nhis feelings evidently injured by the aspersions cast upon his own\r\n\"amateur diplomacy,\" spoke at much length of the interview with Napoleon\r\nand tried to show that on a previous occasion he had been, in fact,\r\n\"employed\" by the Government. Palmerston was pithy and sarcastic in\r\nreply. Lindsay, he said, had \"employed\" himself. He hoped that this\r\nwould be the \"last time when any member of this House shall think it his\r\nduty to communicate to the British House of Commons that which may have\r\npassed between himself and the Sovereign of a foreign country[1103].\"\r\n\r\nThe entire debate on Roebuck's motion was a serious blow to the cause of\r\nthe South in Parliament. Undertaken on a complete misunderstanding of\r\nthe position of Tory leaders, begun with a vehemence that led its mover\r\ninto tactical error, it rapidly dwindled to a mere question of personal\r\nveracity and concluded in sharp reproof from the Government. No doubt\r\nthe very success (so it seemed at the moment) of Southern arms, upon\r\nwhich Roebuck counted to support his motion was, in actual effect, a\r\ndeterrent, since many Southern sympathizers thought Great Britain might\r\nnow keep hands off since the South was \"winning anyway.\" There is no\r\nevidence that Russell thought this, or that he was moved by any\r\nconsideration save the fixed determination to remain neutral--even to\r\nthe extent of reversing a previous decision as to the powers of the\r\nGovernment in relation to Southern ship-building.\r\n\r\nRoebuck withdrew his motion, not because of any imminent Southern\r\nvictory, but because he knew that if pressed to a vote it would be\r\noverwhelmingly defeated. The debate was the last one of importance on\r\nthe topics of mediation or recognition[1104]. News of Lee's check at\r\nGettysburg reached London on July 16, but was described by the _Times_\r\ntwo days later as virtually a Southern victory since the Northern army\r\nhad been compelled to act wholly on the defensive. In the same issue it\r\nwas stated of Vicksburg, \"it is difficult to see what possible hope\r\nthere can be of reducing the city[1105].\" But on July 20, full news of\r\nthe events of July 4, when Vicksburg fell and Lee began his retreat from\r\nGettysburg, was received and its significance acknowledged, though\r\nefforts were made to prove that these events simply showed that neither\r\nside could conquer the other[1106]. In contradiction of previous\r\nassertions that \"another Vicksburg\" might easily be set up to oppose\r\nNorthern advance in the west there was now acknowledgment that the\r\ncapture of this one remaining barrier on the Mississippi was a great\r\ndisaster to the South. _The Index_, forgetful that it was supposedly a\r\nBritish publication, declared: \"The saddest news which has reached _us_\r\nsince the fall of New Orleans is the account of the surrender of\r\nVicksburg. The _very day_ on which the capitulation took place renders\r\nthe blow heavier[1107].\"\r\n\r\n\"The fall of Vicksburg,\" wrote Spence, \"has made me ill all the week,\r\nnever yet being able to drive it off my mind[1108].\" Adams reported that\r\nthe news had caused a panic among the holders of the Cotton Loan bonds\r\nand that the press and upper classes were exceedingly glad they had\r\nrefused support of Roebuck's motion[1109].\r\n\r\nIf July, 1863, may in any way be regarded as the \"crisis\" of Southern\r\neffort in England, it is only as a despairing one doomed to failure from\r\nthe outset, and receiving a further severe set-back by the ill-fortune\r\nof Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania. The real crisis of governmental\r\nattitude had long since passed. Naturally this was not acknowledged by\r\nthe staunch friends of the South any more than at Richmond it was\r\nacknowledged (or understood) that Gettysburg marked the crisis of the\r\nConfederacy. But that the end of Southern hope for British intervention\r\nhad come at Richmond, was made clear by the action of Benjamin, the\r\nConfederate Secretary of State. On August 4, he recalled Mason, writing\r\nthat the recent debates in Parliament showed the Government determined\r\nnot to receive him:\r\n\r\n     \"Under these circumstances, your continued residence in\r\n     London is neither conducive to the interests nor consistent\r\n     with the dignity of this Government, and the President\r\n     therefore requests that you consider your mission at an end,\r\n     and that you withdraw, with your secretary, from\r\n     London[1110].\"\r\n\r\nA private letter accompanying the instruction authorized Mason to remain\r\nif there were any \"marked change\" in governmental attitude, but since\r\nthe decision of the Ministry to seize the Laird Rams had been made\r\npublic at nearly the same moment when this instruction was received,\r\nSeptember 15, Mason could hardly fail to retire promptly. Indeed, the\r\nvery fact of that seizure gave opportunity for a dramatic exit though\r\nthere was no connection between Benjamin's instruction and the stopping\r\nof Confederate ship-building in England. The real connection was with\r\nthe failure of the Gettysburg campaign and the humiliating collapse of\r\nRoebuck's motion. Even the _Times_ was now expanding upon the \"serious\r\nreverses\" of the South and making it clearly understood that England\r\n\"has not had and will not have the slightest inclination to intervention\r\nor mediation, or to take any position except that of strict\r\nneutrality[1111].\"\r\n\r\nMason at once notified Slidell of his receipt of the recall instruction\r\nand secured the latter's approval of the communication he proposed\r\nmaking to Russell[1112]. A general consultation of Southern agents took\r\nplace and Mason would have been vexed had he known how small was the\r\nregard for his abilities as a diplomat[1113]. _The Index_ hastened to\r\njoin in a note already struck at Richmond of warm welcome to France in\r\nher conquest of Mexico, reprinting on September 17, an editorial from\r\nthe _Richmond Enquirer_ in which it was declared, \"France is the only\r\nPower in the world that has manifested any friendly feeling towards the\r\nConfederacy in its terrible struggle for independence.\" Evidently all\r\nhope was now centred upon Napoleon, a conclusion without doubt\r\ndistasteful to Mason and one which he was loth to accept as final.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, Mason notified Russell of his withdrawal very nearly\r\nin the words of Benjamin's instruction. The news was at once made\r\npublic, calling out from the _Times_ a hectoring editorial on the folly\r\nof the South in demanding recognition before it had won it[1114]. In\r\ngeneral, however, the press took a tone apparently intended to \"let\r\nMason down easily,\" acknowledging that his act indicated a universal\r\nunderstanding that Great Britain would not alter her policy of strict\r\nneutrality, but expressing admiration for the courage and confidence of\r\nthe South[1115]. September 25, Russell replied to Mason with courtesy\r\nbut also with seeming finality:\r\n\r\n     \"I have on other occasions explained to you the reasons which\r\n     have induced Her Majesty's Government to decline the\r\n     overtures you allude to, and the motives which have hitherto\r\n     prevented the British Court from recognizing you as the\r\n     accredited Minister of an established State.\r\n\r\n     \"These reasons are still in force, and it is not necessary to\r\n     repeat them.\r\n\r\n     \"I regret that circumstances have prevented my cultivating\r\n     your personal acquaintance, which, in a different state of\r\n     affairs, I should have done with much pleasure and\r\n     satisfaction[1116].\"\r\n\r\nThus Mason took his exit. Brief entrances upon the stage in England were\r\nstill to be his, but the chief rôle there was now assigned to others and\r\nthe principal scenes transferred to France. That Mason did not fully\r\nconcur in this as final, easily as it was accepted by Slidell, is\r\nevident from his later correspondence with Lindsay and Spence. He\r\nregarded the question of British recognition of the South as mainly an\r\nEnglish political question, pinning his hopes on a Tory overthrow of\r\nPalmerston's Ministry. This he believed to depend on the life of the\r\nPrime Minister and his anxious inquiries as to the health of Palmerston\r\nwere frequent. Nothing in his instructions indicated a desired course of\r\naction and Mason after consulting Slidell and, naturally, securing his\r\nacquiescence, determined to remain in Europe waiting events.\r\n\r\nIf the South was indignant at British inaction the North was\r\ncorrespondingly pleased and after the seizure of the Laird Rams was\r\nofficially very friendly--at least so Lyons reported[1117]. In this same\r\nprivate letter, however, Lyons ventured a strong protest against a\r\nnotion which now seems to have occurred to Russell of joint action by\r\nEngland, France and Spain to withdraw belligerent rights _to the North_,\r\nunless the United States formally \"concede to their enemy the status of\r\na Belligerent for all _international_ purposes.\" Why or how this idea\r\ncame to be taken up by Russell is uncertain. Possibly it was the result\r\nof irritation created by the persistence of Seward in denying that the\r\nwar was other than an effort to crush rebellious subjects--theory\r\nclearly against the fact yet consistently maintained by the American\r\nSecretary of State throughout the entire war and constantly causing\r\ndifficulties in relations with neutral countries. At any rate Lyons was\r\nquick to see the danger. He wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Such a declaration might produce a furious outburst of wrath\r\n     from Government and public here. It cannot, however, be\r\n     denied that the reasoning on which the Declaration would be\r\n     founded would be incontrovertible, and that in the end\r\n     firmness answers better with the Americans than coaxing. But\r\n     then England, France and Spain must be really firm, and not\r\n     allow their Declaration to be a _brutum fulmen_. If on its\r\n     being met, as it very probably would be, by a decided refusal\r\n     on the part of the United States, they did not proceed to\r\n     break up the Blockade, or at all events to resist by force\r\n     the exercise of the right of visit on the high seas, the\r\n     United States Government and people would become more\r\n     difficult to deal with than ever. I find, however, that I am\r\n     going beyond my own province, and I will therefore add only\r\n     an excuse for doing so[1118].\"\r\n\r\nLyons followed this up a week later by a long description of America's\r\nreadiness for a foreign war, a situation very different from that of\r\n1861. America, he said, had steadily been preparing for such a\r\ncontingency not with any desire for it but that she might not be caught\r\nnapping[1119]. This was written as if merely an interesting general\r\nspeculation and was accompanied by the assurance, \"I don't think the\r\nGovernment here at all desires to pick a quarrel with us or with any\r\nEuropean Power--but the better prepared it is, the less manageable it\r\nwill be[1120].\" Nevertheless, Lyons' concern over Russell's motion of\r\nwithdrawing belligerent rights to the North was great, and his\r\nrepresentations presumably had effect, for no more was heard of the\r\nmatter. Russell relieved Lyons' mind by writing, November 21:\r\n\r\n     \"I hope you continue to go on quietly with Seward. I think\r\n     this is better than any violent demonstrations of friendship\r\n     which might turn sour like beer if there should be a\r\n     thunder-storm.\r\n\r\n     \"But I am more and more persuaded that amongst the Powers\r\n     with whose Ministers I pass my time there is none with whom\r\n     our relations ought to be so frank and cordial as the United\r\n     States[1121].\"\r\n\r\nIf relations with the North were now to be so \"frank and cordial,\" there\r\nwas, indeed, little remaining hope possible to English friends of the\r\nSouth. Bright wrote to Sumner: \"Neutrality is agreed upon by all, and I\r\nhope a more fair and friendly neutrality than we have seen during the\r\npast two years[1122].\" George Thompson, at Exeter Hall, lauding Henry\r\nWard Beecher for his speech there, commented on the many crowded open\r\npublic meetings in favour of the North as compared with the two\r\npro-Southern ones in London, slimly and privately attended[1123].\r\nJefferson Davis, in addressing the Confederate Congress, December 7, was\r\nbitter upon the \"unfair and deceptive conduct\" of England[1124]. Adams,\r\nby mid-December, 1863, was sure that previous British confidence in the\r\nultimate success of the South was rapidly declining[1125].\r\n\r\nSuch utterances, if well founded, might well have portended the\r\ncessation of further Southern effort in England. That a renewal of\r\nactivity soon occurred was due largely to a sudden shift in the military\r\nsituation in America and to the realization that the heretofore largely\r\nnegative support given to the Southern cause must be replaced by\r\norganized and persistent effort. Grant's victorious progress in the West\r\nhad been checked by the disaster to Rosencrans at Chicamauga, September\r\n18, and Grant's army forced to retrace its steps to recover\r\nChattanooga. It was not until November 24 that the South was compelled\r\nto release its grip upon that city. Meanwhile in the East, Lee, fallen\r\nback to his old lines before Richmond, presented a still impregnable\r\nfront to Northern advance. No sudden collapse, such as had been\r\nexpected, followed the Southern defeats at Vicksburg and Gettysburg.\r\nAgain the contest presented the appearance of a drawn battle. Small\r\nwonder then that McHenry, confident in his statistics, should now\r\ndeclare that at last cotton was to become in truth King[1126], and count\r\nmuch upon the effect of the arguments advanced in his recently published\r\nbook[1127]. Small wonder that Southern friends should hurry the\r\norganization of the \"Southern Independence Association.\" Seeking a\r\nspecific point of attack and again hoping for Tory support they first\r\nfixed their attention on the new trial of the _Alexandra_, on appeal\r\nfrom the decision by the Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer. On\r\nDecember 4, Lindsay wrote to Mason that he had daily been \"journeying to\r\ntown\" with the \"old Chief Baron\" and was confident the Government would\r\nagain be defeated--in which case it would be very open to attack for the\r\nseizure of the Rams also. Nevertheless he was emphatic in his caution to\r\nMason not to place too high a hope on any change in Government policy or\r\non any expectation that the Tories would replace Palmerston[1128].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1041: Trollope, _North America_, I, p. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1042: Mason Papers.

In 1912-13 I made\r\nnotes from various materials originating with Hotze, these being then in\r\nthe possession of Mr. Charles Francis Adams. These materials were (1) a\r\nletter and cash book marked \"C.S.A.

Describing his activities\r\nto Benjamin, Hotze stated that in addition to maintaining the _Index_,\r\nhe furnished news items and _editorials_ to various London papers, had\r\nseven paid writers on these papers, and was a pretty constant\r\ndistributor of \"boxes of cigars imported from Havana ... American\r\nwhiskey and other articles.\" He added: \"It is, of course, out of the\r\nquestion to give vouchers.\" (Hotze Papers MS. Letter Book. Hotze to\r\nBenjamin, No. 19, March 14, 1863.) In Hotze's cash book one of his\r\nregular payees was Percy Gregg who afterwards wrote a history of the\r\nConfederacy.

For the last half of the war the _Times_ was badly\r\nserved by this correspondent who invariably reported the situation from\r\nan extreme anti-Northern point of view. This was Charles Mackay who\r\nserved the _Times_ in New York from March, 1862, to December, 1865.\r\n(Mackay, _Forty Years' Recollections_, II, p. 412.) Possibly he had\r\nstrict instructions. During this same week Lyons, writing privately to\r\nRussell, minimized the \"scare\" about Lee's advance. He reported that\r\nMercier had ordered up a war-ship to take him away if Washington should\r\nfall. Lyons cannily decided such a step for himself inadvisable, since\r\nit would irritate Seward and in case the unexpected happened he could no\r\ndoubt get passage on Mercier's ship. When news came of the Southern\r\ndefeat at Gettysburg and of Grant's capture of Vicksburg, Lyons thought\r\nthe complete collapse of the Confederacy an imminent possibility. Leslie\r\nStephen is a witness to the close relations of Seward and Lyons at this\r\ntime. He visited Washington about a month after Gettysburg and met\r\nSeward, being received with much cordiality as a _verbal_ champion in\r\nEngland of the North. (He had as yet published no signed articles on the\r\nwar.) In this conversation he was amused that Seward spoke of the\r\nfriendly services of \"Monkton Mill,\" as a publicist on political\r\neconomy. (Maitland, _Leslie Stephen_, p. 120.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1102: In this issue a letter from the New York correspondent,\r\ndated July 1, declared that all of the North except New England, would\r\nwelcome Lee's triumph: \"... he and Mr. Jefferson Davis might ride in\r\ntriumph up Broadway, amid the acclamations of a more enthusiastic\r\nmultitude than ever assembled on the Continent of America.\" The New York\r\ncity which soon after indulged in the \"draft riots\" might give some\r\nground for such writing, but it was far fetched, nevertheless--and New\r\nYork was not the North.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1103: Hansard, 3rd Ser., CLXXII, 661 _seq_.

Writing on January 23, 1863, of the mis-information spread about\r\nAmerica by the _Times_, Goldwin Smith asserted: \"I think I never felt so\r\nmuch as in this matter the enormous power which the _Times_ has, not\r\nfrom the quality of its writing, which of late has been rather poor, but\r\nfrom its exclusive command of publicity and its exclusive access to a\r\nvast number of minds.

Southern friends,\r\nconfident in the ultimate success of the Confederacy and equally\r\nconfident that they had with them the great bulk of upper-class opinion\r\nin England, at first thought it unnecessary to be active in public\r\nexpressions aside from such as were made through the newspapers. Up to\r\nNovember, 1862, _The Index_ records no Southern public meeting. But by\r\nthe summer of 1863, the indefatigable Spence had come to the conclusion\r\nthat something must be done to offset the efforts of Bright and others,\r\nespecially in the manufacturing districts where a strong Northern\r\nsympathy had been created. On June 16, he wrote to Mason that on his\r\ninitiative a Southern Club had been organized in Manchester and that\r\nothers were now forming in Oldham, Blackburn and Stockport. In\r\nManchester the Club members had \"smashed up the last Abolitionist\r\nmeeting in the Free Trade Hall\":\r\n\r\n     \"These parties are not the rich spinners but young men of\r\n     energy with a taste for agitation but little money. It\r\n     appears to my judgment that it would be wise not to stint\r\n     money in aiding this effort to expose cant and diffuse the\r\n     truth. Manchester is naturally the centre of such a move and\r\n     you will see there are here the germs of important work--but\r\n     they need to be tended and fostered. I have supplied a good\r\n     deal of money individually but I see room for the use of £30\r\n     or £40 a month or more[1129].\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal for funds (though Spence wrote that he would advance the\r\nrequired amounts on the chance of reimbursement from the Confederate\r\nsecret service fund) is interesting in comparison with the contributions\r\nwillingly made by Bright's friends. \"Young men of energy with a taste\r\nfor agitation but little money\" reveals a source of support somewhat\r\ndubious in persistent zeal and requiring more than a heavy list of\r\npatrons' names to keep up a public interest. Nevertheless, Spence\r\nsucceeded, for a short time, in arousing a show of energy. November 24,\r\n1863, Mason wrote to Mann that measures were \"in progress and in course\r\nof execution\" to hold public meetings, memorialize Parliament, and form\r\nan association for the promotion of Southern independence \"under the\r\nauspices of such men as the Marquis of Lothian, Lord Robert Cecil, M.P.,\r\nLord Wharncliffe, Lord Eustace Cecil, Messrs. Haliburton, Lindsay,\r\nPeacocke, Van Stittart, M.P., Beresford Hope, Robert Bourke, and\r\nothers[1130]....\" A fortnight later, Spence reported his efforts and\r\npostulated that in them, leading to European intervention, lay the\r\nprincipal, if not the only hope, of Southern independence--a view never\r\n_publicly_ acknowledged by any devoted friend of the South:\r\n\r\n     \"The news is gloomy--very, and I really do not see how the\r\n     war is to be worked out to success without the action of\r\n     Europe. That is stopped by our Government but there is a\r\n     power that will move the latter, if it can only be stirred\r\n     up, and that, of course, is public opinion. I had a most\r\n     agreeable and successful visit to Glasgow upon a requisition\r\n     signed by the citizens. The enemy placarded the walls and\r\n     brought all their forces to the meeting, in which out of\r\n     4,000 I think they were fully 1,000 strong, but we beat them\r\n     completely, carrying a resolution which embraced a memorial\r\n     to Lord Palmerston. We have now carried six public meetings,\r\n     Sheffield, Oldham, Stockport, Preston, Ashton, Glasgow. We\r\n     have three to come off now ready, Burnley, Bury,\r\n     Macclesfield, and others in preparation. My plan is to work\r\n     up through the secondary towns to the chief ones and take the\r\n     latter, Liverpool, Manchester, London, etc., as we come upon\r\n     the assembling of Parliament.... By dint of perseverance I\r\n     think we shall succeed. The problem is simply to convert\r\n     latent into active sympathy. There is ample power on our side\r\n     to move the Cabinet--divided as it is, if we can only arouse\r\n     that power. At any rate the object is worth the\r\n     effort[1131].\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, _The Index_ began to report these meetings. In\r\nnearly all, Northern partisans were present, attempted to heckle the\r\nspeakers, and usually presented amendments to the address which were\r\nvoted down. Spence was given great credit for his energy, being called\r\n\"indefatigable\":\r\n\r\n     \"The commencement of the session will see Parliament flooded\r\n     with petitions from every town and from every mill throughout\r\n     the North. A loud protest will arise against the _faineant_\r\n     policy which declines to interfere while men of English blood\r\n     are uselessly murdering each other by thousands, and while\r\n     England's most important manufacture is thereby ruined.... It\r\n     remains to be seen whether the voice of the North will have\r\n     any effect upon the policy of the Government[1132].\"\r\n\r\nBy \"the North\" was meant the manufacturing districts and an explanation\r\nwas made of the difficulty of similar efforts in London because it was\r\nreally a \"congeries of cities,\" with no such solidarity of interests as\r\ncharacterized \"the North[1133].\" Without London, however, the movement\r\nlacked driving force and it was determined to create there an\r\nassociation which should become the main-spring of further activities.\r\nSpence, Beresford Hope, and Lord Eustace Cecil were made a committee to\r\ndraft a plan and preliminary address. Funds were now forthcoming from\r\nthe big blockade-running firms\r\n\r\n     \"Some time ago I saw friend Collie, who had made a terrific\r\n     sum of money, and told him he must come out for the cause in\r\n     proportion thereto. To this he responded like a brick, I was\r\n     near saying, but I mean Briton--by offering at once to devote\r\n     a percentage of cotton out of each steamer that runs the\r\n     blockade, to the good of the cause. He has given me at once\r\n     £500 on account of this--which I got to-day in a cheque and\r\n     have sent on to Lord Eustace Cecil, our treasurer. Thus, you\r\n     see, we are fairly afloat there[1134].\"\r\n\r\nYet Spence was fighting against fear that all this agitation was too\r\nlate:\r\n\r\n     \"Nevertheless it is not to be disguised that the evil tidings\r\n     make uphill work of it--very. Public opinion has quite veered\r\n     round to the belief that the South will be exhausted. The\r\n     _Times_ correspondent's letters do great harm--more\r\n     especially Gallenga's--who replaced Chas. Mackay at New York.\r\n     I have, however, taken a berth for Mackay by Saturday's boat,\r\n     so he will soon be out again and he is dead for our\r\n     side[1135].\"\r\n\r\nAgain Spence asserted the one great hope to be in European intervention:\r\n\r\n     \"I am now clear in my own mind that unless we get Europe to\r\n     move--or some improbable convulsion occur in the North--the\r\n     end will be a sad one. It seems to me therefore, impossible\r\n     that too strenuous an effort can be made to move our\r\n     Government and I cannot understand the Southerners who say:\r\n     'Oh, what can you make of it?' I have known a man brought\r\n     back to life two hours after he seemed stone-dead--the\r\n     efforts at first seemed hopeless, but in case of life or\r\n     death what effort should be spared[1136]?\"\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Southern Club was the most active of those organized by\r\nSpence and was the centre for operations in the manufacturing districts.\r\nOn December 15, a great gathering (as described by _The Index_) took\r\nplace there with delegates from many of the near-by towns[1137]. Forster\r\nreferred to this and other meetings as \"spasmodic and convulsive efforts\r\nbeing made by Southern Clubs to cause England to interfere in American\r\naffairs[1138],\" but the enthusiasm at Manchester was unquestioned and\r\nplans were on foot to bombard with petitions the Queen, Palmerston,\r\nRussell and others in authority, but more especially the members of\r\nParliament as a body. These petitions were \"in process of being signed\r\nin every town and almost in every cotton-mill throughout the\r\ndistrict[1139].\" It was high time for London, if it was desired that she\r\nshould lead and _control_ these activities, to perfect her own Club.\r\n\"Next week,\" wrote Lindsay, on January 8, 1864, it would be\r\nformally launched under the name of \"The Southern Independence\r\nAssociation[1140],\" and would be in working order before the\r\nreassembling of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe organization of meetings by Spence and the formation of the Southern\r\nIndependence Association were attempts to do for the South what Bright\r\nand others had done earlier and so successfully for the North. Tardily\r\nthe realization had come that public opinion, even though but slightly\r\nrepresented in Parliament, was yet a powerful weapon with which to\r\ninfluence the Government. Unenfranchised England now received from\r\nSouthern friends a degree of attention hitherto withheld from it by\r\nthose gentry who had been confident that the goodwill of the bulk of\r\ntheir own class was sufficient support to the Southern cause. Early in\r\nthe war one little Southern society had indeed been organized, but on so\r\ndiffident a basis as almost to escape notice. This was the _London\r\nConfederate States Aid Association_ which came to the attention of Adams\r\nand his friends in December, 1862, through the attendance at an early\r\nmeeting of one, W.A. Jackson (\"Jefferson Davis' ex-coachman\"), who\r\nreported the proceedings to George Thompson. The meeting was held at 3\r\nDevonshire Street, Portland Place, was attended by some fifty persons\r\nand was addressed by Dr. Lempriere. A Mr. Beals, evidently an unwelcome\r\nguest, interrupted the speaker, was forcibly ejected by a policeman and\r\ngot revenge by arranging a demonstration against Mason (who was\r\npresent), confronting him, on leaving the house, with a placard showing\r\na negro in chains[1141]. There was no \"public effort\" contemplated in\r\nsuch a meeting, although funds were to be solicited to aid the South.\r\nAdams reported the Association as a sort of Club planning to hold\r\nregular Wednesday evening meetings of its members, the dues being a\r\nshilling a week and the rules providing for loss of membership for\r\nnon-attendance[1142].\r\n\r\nNothing more is heard of this Association after December, 1862. Possibly\r\nits puerilities killed it and in any case it was not intended to appeal\r\nto the public[1143]. But the launching of the Southern Independence\r\nAssociation betokened the new policy of constructive effort in London to\r\nmatch and guide that already started in the provinces. A long and\r\ncarefully worded constitution and address depicted the heroic struggles\r\nof the Confederates and the \"general sympathy\" of England for their\r\ncause; dwelt upon the \"governmental tyranny, corruption in high places,\r\nruthlessness in war, untruthfulness of speech, and causeless animosity\r\ntoward Great Britain\" of the North; and declared that the interests of\r\nAmerica and of the world would be best served by the independence of the\r\nSouth. The effect of a full year's penetration in England of Lincoln's\r\nemancipation proclamation is shown in the necessity felt by the framers\r\nof this constitution to meet that issue. This required delicate handling\r\nand was destined to cause some heart-burnings. The concluding section of\r\nthe constitution read:\r\n\r\n     \"The Association will also devote itself to the cultivation\r\n     of kindly feelings between the people of Great Britain and of\r\n     the Confederate States; and it will, in particular, steadily\r\n     but kindly represent to the Southern States, that recognition\r\n     by Europe must necessarily lead to a revision of the system\r\n     of servile labour, unhappily bequeathed to them by England,\r\n     in accordance with the spirit of the age, so as to combine\r\n     the gradual extinction of slavery with the preservation of\r\n     property, the maintenance of the civil polity, and the true\r\n     civilization of the negro race[1144].\"\r\n\r\nThe Association was unquestionably armed with distinguished guns of\r\nheavy calibre in its Committee and officers, and its membership fee (one\r\nguinea annually) was large enough to attract the élite, but it remained\r\nto be seen whether all this equipment would be sent into action. As yet\r\nthe vigour of the movement was centred at Manchester and even there a\r\ncurious situation soon arose. Spence in various speeches, was declaring\r\nthat the \"Petition to Parliament\" movement was spreading rapidly. 30,000\r\nat Ashton, he said, had agreed to memoralize the Government. But on\r\nJanuary 30, 1864, Mason Jones, a pro-Northern speaker in the Free Trade\r\nHall at Manchester, asked why Southern public meetings had come to\r\na halt. \"The Southerners,\" he declared, \"had taken the Free Trade Hall\r\nin the outset with that intention and they were obliged to pay the rent\r\nof the room, though they did not use it. They knew that their\r\nresolutions would be outvoted and that amendments would pass against\r\nthem[1145].\" There must have been truth in the taunt for while _The\r\nIndex_ in nearly every issue throughout the middle of 1864 reports great\r\nactivity there, it does not give any account of a public meeting. The\r\nreports were of many applications for membership \"from all quarters,\r\nfrom persons of rank and gentlemen of standing in their respective\r\ncounties[1146].\"\r\n\r\nJust here lay the weakness of the Southern Independence Association\r\nprogramme. It _did_ appeal to \"persons of rank and gentlemen of\r\nstanding,\" but by the very fact of the flocking to it of these classes\r\nit precluded appeal to Radical and working-class England--already\r\nlargely committed to the cause of the North. Goldwin Smith, in his\r\n\"Letter to a Whig Member of the Southern Independence Association,\" made\r\nthe point very clear[1147]. In this pamphlet, probably the strongest\r\npresentation of the Northern side and the most severe castigation of\r\nSouthern sympathizers that appeared throughout the whole war, Smith\r\nappealed to old Whig ideas of political liberty, attacked the\r\naristocracy and the Church of England, and attempted to make the\r\nRadicals of England feel that the Northern cause was their cause.\r\nPrinting the constitution and address of the Association, with the list\r\nof signers, he characterized the movement as fostered by \"men of title\r\nand family,\" with \"a good sprinkling of clergymen,\" and as having for\r\nits object the plunging of Great Britain into war with the North[1148].\r\n\r\nIt is significant, in view of Mason Jones' taunt to the Southern\r\nIndependence Association at Manchester, that _The Index_, from the end\r\nof March to August, 1864, was unable to report a single Southern public\r\nmeeting. The London Association, having completed its top-heavy\r\norganization, was content with that act and showed no life. The first\r\nmove by the Association was planned to be made in connection with the\r\n_Alexandra_ case when, as was expected, the Exchequer Court should\r\nrender a decision against the Government's right to detain her. On\r\nJanuary 8, 1864, Lindsay wrote to Mason that he had arranged for the\r\npublic launching of the Association \"next week,\" that he had again seen\r\nthe Chief Baron who assured him the Court would decide \"that the\r\nGovernment is entirely wrong\":\r\n\r\n     \"I told him that if the judgment was clear, and if the\r\n     Government persisted in proceeding further, that our\r\n     Association (which he was pleased to learn had been formed)\r\n     would take up the matter in Parliament and out of it, for if\r\n     we had no right to seize these ships, it was most unjust that\r\n     we should detain them by raising legal quibbles for the\r\n     purpose of keeping them here till the time arrived when the\r\n     South might not require them. I think public opinion will go\r\n     with us on this point, for John Bull--with all his\r\n     failings--loves fair play[1149].\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the language used by Lindsay that he was\r\nthinking of the Laird Rams and other ships fully as much as of the\r\n_Alexandra_[1150], and hoped much from an attack on the Government's\r\npolicy in detaining Southern vessels. Earl Russell was to be made to\r\nbear the brunt of this attack on the reassembling of Parliament. In an\r\n_Index_ editorial, Adams was pictured as having driven Russell into a\r\ncorner by \"threats which would not have been endured for an hour by a\r\nPitt or a Canning\"; the Foreign Secretary as invariably yielding to the\r\n\"acknowledged mastery of the Yankee Minister\":\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Adams' pretensions are extravagant, his logic is\r\n     blundering, his threats laughable; but he has hit his mark.\r\n     We can trace his influence in the detention of the\r\n     _Alexandra_ and the protracted judicial proceedings which\r\n     have arisen out of it; in the sudden raid upon the rams at\r\n     Birkenhead; in the announced intention of the Government to\r\n     alter the Foreign Enlistment Act of this country in\r\n     accordance with the views of the United States Cabinet. When\r\n     one knows the calibre of Mr. Adams one feels inclined to\r\n     marvel at his success. The astonishment ceases when one\r\n     reflects that the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs is\r\n     Earl Russell[1151].\"\r\n\r\nBut when, on February 23, the debate on the Laird Rams occurred[1152],\r\nthe Tory leaders, upon whom Lindsay and others depended to drive home\r\nthe meaning of the _Alexandra_ decision, carefully avoided urging the\r\nGovernment to change its policy and contented themselves with an\r\neffort, very much in line with that initiated by _The Index_, to\r\nbelittle Russell as yielding to a threat. Adams was even applauded by\r\nthe Tories for his discretion and his anxiety to keep the two countries\r\nout of war. The Southern Independence Association remained quiescent.\r\nVery evidently someone, presumably Derby or Disraeli, had put a quietus\r\non the plan to make an issue of the stoppage of Southern ship-building.\r\nRussell's reply to his accusers was but a curt denial without going into\r\ndetails, in itself testimony that he had no fear of a party attack on\r\nthe _policy_ of stopping the ships. He was disgusted with the result of\r\nthe _Alexandra_ trial and in conversation with Adams reflected upon \"the\r\nuncertainty and caprice incident everywhere to the administration of\r\njustice[1153].\"\r\n\r\nAs between Russell and Seward the waters formerly troubled by the stiff\r\nmanner and tone of the one statesman and the flamboyance of the other\r\nwere now unusually calm. Russell was less officious and less eager to\r\nprotest on minor matters and Seward was less belligerent in language.\r\nSeward now radiated supreme confidence in the ultimate victory of the\r\nNorth. He had heard rumours of a movement to be made in Parliament for\r\ninterposition to bring the war to an end by a reunion of North and South\r\non a basis of Abolition and of a Northern assumption of the Confederate\r\ndebts. Commenting on this to Lyons he merely remarked that the Northern\r\nanswer could be put briefly as: (1) determination to crush rebellion by\r\nforce of arms and resentment of any \"interposition\"; (2) the slaves were\r\nalready free and would not be made the subject of any bargain; (3) \"As\r\nto the Confederate debt the United States, Mr. Seward said, would never\r\npay a dollar of it[1154].\" That there was public animosity to Great\r\nBritain, Lyons did not deny and reported a movement in Congress for\r\nending the reciprocity treaty with Canada but, on Seward's advice, paid\r\nno attention to this, acknowledging that Seward was very wise in\r\npolitical manipulation and depending on his opposition to the\r\nmeasure[1155]. Some alarm was indeed caused through a recurrence by\r\nSeward to an idea dating back to the very beginning of the war of\r\nestablishing ships off the Southern ports which should collect duties on\r\nimports. He told Lyons that he had sent a special agent to Adams to\r\nexplain the proposal with a view to requesting the approval of Great\r\nBritain. Lyons urged that no such request be made as it was sure to be\r\nrefused, interpreting the plan as intended to secure a British\r\nwithdrawal of belligerent rights to the South, to be followed by a bold\r\nNorthern defiance to France if she objected[1156]. Adams did discuss the\r\nproject with Russell but easily agreed to postpone consideration of it\r\nand in this Seward quietly acquiesced[1157]. Apparently this was less a\r\nmatured plan than a \"feeler,\" put out to sound British attitude and to\r\nlearn, if possible, whether the tie previously binding England and\r\nFrance in their joint policy toward America was still strong. Certainly\r\nat this same time Seward was making it plain to Lyons that while opposed\r\nto current Congressional expressions of antagonism to Napoleon's Mexican\r\npolicy, he was himself in favour, once the Civil War was ended, of\r\nhelping the republican Juarez drive the French from Mexico[1158].\r\n\r\nFor nearly three years Russell, like nearly all Englishmen, had held a\r\nfirm belief that the South could not be conquered and that ultimately\r\nthe North must accept the bitter pill of Southern independence. Now he\r\nbegan to doubt, yet still held to the theory that even if conquered the\r\nSouth would never yield peaceful obedience to the Federal Government.\r\nAs a reasoning and reasonable statesman he wished that the North could\r\nbe made to see this.\r\n\r\n     \"... It is a pity,\" he wrote to Lyons, \"the Federals think it\r\n     worth their while to go on with the war. The obedience they\r\n     are ever likely to obtain from the South will not be quiet or\r\n     lasting, and they must spend much money and blood to get it.\r\n     If they can obtain the right bank of the Mississippi, and New\r\n     Orleans, they might as well leave to the Confederates\r\n     Charleston and Savannah[1159].\"\r\n\r\nThis was but private speculation with no intention of urging it upon the\r\nUnited States. Yet it indicated a change in the view held as to the\r\nwarlike _power_ of the North. Similarly the _Quarterly Review_, long\r\nconfident of Southern success and still prophesying it, was\r\nacknowledging that \"the unholy [Northern] dream of universal empire\"\r\nmust first have passed[1160]. Throughout these spring months of 1864,\r\nLyons continued to dwell upon the now thoroughly developed readiness of\r\nthe United States for a foreign war and urged the sending of a military\r\nexpert to report on American preparations[1161]. He was disturbed by the\r\narrogance manifested by various members of Lincoln's Cabinet, especially\r\nby Welles, Secretary of the Navy, with whom Seward, so Lyons wrote,\r\noften had difficulty in demonstrating the unfortunate diplomatic bearing\r\nof the acts of naval officers. Seward was as anxious as was Lyons to\r\navoid irritating incidents, \"but he is not as much listened to as he\r\nought to be by his colleagues in the War and Navy Departments[1162].\"\r\n\r\nSuch an act by a naval officer, defiant of British authority and\r\ndisregardful of her law, occurred in connection with a matter already\r\nattracting the attention of the British public and causing some anxiety\r\nto Russell--the alleged securing in Ireland of enlistments for the\r\nNorthern forces. The war in America had taken from the ranks of industry\r\nin the North great numbers of men and at the same time had created an\r\nincreased demand for labour. But the war had also abruptly checked, in\r\nlarge part, that emigration from Europe which, since the middle\r\n'forties, had been counted upon as a regular source of labour supply,\r\neasily absorbed in the steady growth of productive enterprise. A few\r\nNorthern emissaries of the Government early sent abroad to revive\r\nimmigration were soon reinforced by private labour agents and by the\r\nefforts of steamship companies[1163]. This resulted in a rapid\r\nresumption of emigration in 1863, and in several cases groups of\r\nIrishmen signed contracts of such a nature (with non-governmental\r\nagents) that on arrival in America they were virtually black-jacked into\r\nthe army. The agents thereby secured large profits from the sums offered\r\nunder the bounty system of some of the Eastern states for each recruit.\r\nLyons soon found himself called upon to protest, on appeal from a few of\r\nthese hoodwinked British citizens, and Seward did the best he could to\r\nsecure redress, though the process was usually a long one owing to\r\nred-tape and also to the resistance of army officers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the scheme of \"bounty profiteers\" was discovered prompt steps\r\nwere taken to defeat it by the American Secretary of State. But the few\r\ncases occurring, combined with the acknowledged and encouraged agents of\r\n_bona fide_ labour emigration from Ireland, gave ground for accusations\r\nin Parliament that Ireland was being used against the law as a place of\r\nenlistments. Russell had early taken up the matter with Adams,\r\ninvestigation had followed, and on it appearing that no authorized\r\nNorthern agent was engaged in recruiting in Ireland the subject had been\r\ndropped[1164]. There could be and was no objection to encourage labour\r\nemigration, and this was generally recognized as the basis of the sudden\r\nincrease of the numbers going to America[1165]. But diplomatic and\r\npublic quiescence was disturbed when the United States war vessel\r\n_Kearsarge_, while in port at Queenstown, November, 1863, took on board\r\nfifteen Irishmen and sailed away with them. Russell at once received\r\nindirectly from Mason (who was now in France), charges that these men\r\nhad been enlisted and in the presence of the American consul at\r\nQueenstown; he was prompt in investigation but before this was well\r\nunder way the _Kearsarge_ sailed into Queenstown again and landed the\r\nmen. She had gone to a French port and no doubt Adams was quick to give\r\norders for her return. Adams was soon able to disprove the accusation\r\nagainst the consul but it still remained a question whether the\r\ncommander of the vessel was guilty of a bold defiance of British\r\nneutrality. On March 31, 1864, the Irishmen, on trial at Cork, pleaded\r\nguilty to violation of the Foreign Enlistment Act, but the question of\r\nthe commander's responsibility was permitted to drop on Adams' promise,\r\nApril 11, of further investigation[1166].\r\n\r\nThe _Kearsarge_ case occurred as Parliament was drawing to a close in\r\n1863, and at a time when Southern efforts were at low ebb. It was not,\r\ntherefore, until some months later when a gentleman with a shady past,\r\nnamed Patrick Phinney, succeeded in evading British laws and in carrying\r\noff to America a group of Irishmen who found themselves, unwillingly,\r\nforced into the Northern army, that the two cases were made the subject\r\nof a Southern and Tory attack on Russell. The accusations were sharply\r\nmade that Russell was not sufficiently active in defending British law\r\nand British honour[1167], but these were rather individual accusations\r\nthan concerted and do not indicate any idea of making an issue with the\r\nGovernment[1168]. Whenever opportunity arose some inquiry up to July,\r\n1864, would be made intended to bring out the alleged timidity of\r\nRussell's policy towards the North--a method then also being employed on\r\nmany other matters with the evident intention of weakening the Ministry\r\nfor the great Tory attack now being organized on the question of\r\nDanish policy.\r\n\r\nIn truth from the beginning of 1864, America had been pushed to one side\r\nin public and parliamentary interest by the threatening Danish question\r\nwhich had long been brewing but which did not come into sharp prominence\r\nuntil March. A year earlier it had become known that Frederick VII of\r\nDenmark, in anticipation of a change which, under the operations of the\r\nSalic law, would come at his death in the constitutional relations of\r\nDenmark to Schleswig-Holstein, was preparing by a new \"constitutional\r\nact\" to secure for his successor the retention of these districts. The\r\nlaw was enacted on November 13, 1863, and Frederick VII died two days\r\nlater. His successor, Christian IX, promptly declared his intention to\r\nhold the duchies in spite of their supposed desire to separate from\r\nDenmark and to have their own Prince in the German Confederation. The\r\nFederal Diet of the Confederation had early protested the purpose of\r\nDenmark and Russell had at first upheld the German arguments but had\r\ngiven no pledges of support to anyone[1169]. But Palmerston on various\r\noccasions had gone out of his way to express in Parliament his favour\r\nfor the Danish cause and had used incautious language even to the point\r\nof virtually threatening British aid against German ambitions[1170]. A\r\ndistinct crisis was thus gradually created, coming to a head when\r\nPrussia, under Bismarck's guiding hand, dragging Austria in with her,\r\nthrust the Federal Diet of the Confederation to one side, and assumed\r\ncommand of the movement to wrest Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark.\r\n\r\nThis occurred in February, 1864, and by this time Palmerston's\r\nutterances, made against the wish of the majority of his Cabinet\r\ncolleagues (though this was not known), had so far aroused the British\r\npublic as to have created a feeling, widely voiced, that Great Britain\r\ncould not sit idly by while Prussia and Austria worked their will on\r\nDenmark. There was excellent ground for a party attack to unseat the\r\nMinistry on the score of a humiliating \"Danish policy,\" at one time\r\nthreatening vigorous British action, then resorting to weak and\r\nunsuccessful diplomatic manoeuvres. For three months the Government\r\nlaboured to bring about through a European council some solution that\r\nshould both save something for Denmark and save its own prestige.\r\nRepeatedly Palmerston, in the many parliamentary debates on Denmark,\r\nbroke loose from his Cabinet colleagues and indulged in threats which\r\ncould not fail to give an excellent handle to opponents when once it\r\nbecame clear that the Ministry had no intention of coming in arms to the\r\ndefence of the Danish King.\r\n\r\nFrom February to June, 1864, this issue was to the fore. In its earlier\r\nstages it did not appear to Southern sympathizers to have any essential\r\nbearing on the American question, though they were soon to believe that\r\nin it lay a great hope. Having set the Southern Independence Association\r\non its feet in London and hoping much from its planned activities,\r\nLindsay, in March, was momentarily excited over rumours of some new move\r\nby Napoleon. Being undeceived[1171] he gave a ready ear to other\r\nrumours, received privately through Delane of the _Times_, that an\r\nimportant Southern victory would soon be forthcoming[1172]. Donoughmore,\r\nthe herald of this glad news also wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Our political prospects here are still very uncertain. The\r\n     Conference on the Danish question will either make or mar\r\n     the Government. If they can patch up a peace they will remain\r\n     in office. If they fail, out they go[1173].\"\r\n\r\nHere was early expressed the real hope of one faction of extreme\r\nSouthern friends in the Danish question. But Lindsay had not yet made\r\nclear where he stood on a possible use of a European situation to affect\r\nthe cause of the South. Now, as always, he was the principal confidant\r\nand friend of Mason in England, but he was on ordinary political\r\nquestions not in sympathy with Tory principles or measures. He was soon\r\ndisgusted with the apathy of the London Independence Association and\r\nthreatened to resign membership if this organization, started with much\r\ntrumpeting of intended activity, did not come out boldly in a public\r\ndemand for the recognition of the South[1174]. He had already let it be\r\nknown that another motion would be made in Parliament for mediation and\r\nrecognition and was indignant that the Association did not at once\r\ndeclare its adherence. Evidently there were internal difficulties.\r\nLindsay wrote Mason that he retained membership only to prevent a break\r\nup of the Association and had at last succeeded in securing a meeting of\r\nthe Executive Committee when his proposed parliamentary resolution would\r\nbe considered. The Manchester Association was much more alert and ready\r\nto support him. \"The question is quite ripe _for fresh agitation_ and\r\nfrom experience I find that that agitation _must_ be started by a debate\r\nin Parliament. No notice is taken of lectures or speeches in the\r\nprovinces[1175].\"\r\n\r\nBefore any move was made in Parliament letters to the newspapers began\r\nanew to urge that the Ministry should be pressed to offer mediation in\r\nAmerica. They met with little favourable response. The _Times_, at the\r\nvery end of Lindsay's effort, explained its indifference, and recited\r\nthe situation of October-November, 1862, stating that the question had\r\nthen been decided once for all. It declared that Great Britain had \"no\r\nmoral right to interfere\" and added that to attempt to do so would\r\nresult in filling \"the North with the same spirit of patriotism and\r\ndefiance as animated the invaded Confederates[1176].\" Thus support to\r\nLindsay was lacking in a hoped-for quarter, but his conferences with\r\nAssociation members had brought a plan of modified action the essential\r\nfeature of which was that the parliamentary motion must not be made a\r\n_party_ one and that the only hope of the South lay in the existing\r\nGovernment. This was decidedly Lindsay's own view though it was clearly\r\nunderstood that the opportuneness of the motion lay in ministerial\r\ndesire for and need of support in its Danish policy. Lindsay expected to\r\nfind Palmerston more complaisant than formerly as regards American\r\npolicy and was not disappointed. He wrote to Mason on May 27:\r\n\r\n     \"I received in due course your note of the 23rd. In a matter\r\n     of so much importance I shall make no move in the House in\r\n     regard to American affairs without grave consideration. I am\r\n     therefore privately consulting the friends of the South. On\r\n     this subject we had a meeting of our lifeless association on\r\n     Monday last and on the same subject we are to have another\r\n     meeting next Monday; but differences of opinion exist there\r\n     as well as elsewhere, as to the advisability of moving at\r\n     present. Some say 'move'--others, 'postpone'--but the news by\r\n     the _Scotia_ to-morrow will regulate to a considerable extent\r\n     our course of action. One thing is now clear to me that the\r\n     motion must _not_ be a party one, and that the main point\r\n     will be to get the Government to go with _whoever_ brings\r\n     forward the motion, for as you are aware I would rather see\r\n     the motion in other hands than mine, as my views on the\r\n     American question are so well known. As no competent member\r\n     however seems disposed to move or rather to incur the\r\n     responsibility, I sent to inquire if it would be agreeable\r\n     to Lord Palmerston to see me on American affairs and on the\r\n     subject of a motion to be brought forward in the House. He\r\n     sent word that he would be very glad to see me, and I had,\r\n     therefore, a long meeting with him alone last night, the\r\n     result of which was that if I brought forward a motion\r\n     somewhat as follows, on the third of June, he would likely be\r\n     prepared _to accept it_, though he asked if I would see him\r\n     again after the _Scotia_ arrived. The motion we talked about\r\n     was to this _effect_--'That the House of Commons deeply\r\n     regretting the great loss of life and the sufferings of the\r\n     people of the United States and the Confederate States of\r\n     North America by the continuance of the war which has been so\r\n     long waged between them, trust that Her Majesty's Government\r\n     will avail itself of the earliest opportunity of mediating in\r\n     conjunction with the other powers of Europe to bring about a\r\n     cessation of hostilities.'\"\r\n\r\nLindsay had suggested to Palmerston that it was desirable for Mason to\r\nreturn to England and have a conference with the Premier. To this\r\nPalmerston gave a ready consent but, of course, no invitation. Lindsay\r\nstrongly urged Mason to come over:\r\n\r\n     _I think much good will follow your meeting Lord Palmerston.\r\n     It will lead to other meetings_; and besides in other matters\r\n     I think if you came here, you might _at present_ prove of\r\n     much service to the South[1177].\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the difference within the Southern Independence Association\r\npermitted the coming forward of a minor London organization called _The\r\nSociety for Promoting the Cessation of Hostilities in America_. A letter\r\nwas addressed by it to Members of Parliament urging that the time had\r\ncome for action:\r\n\r\n     \"215 _Regent Street,\r\n     London, W.\r\n     May 28th_, 1864.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"The Society which has the honour to present to you the\r\n     accompanying pamphlet, begs to state that there now exists in\r\n     Great Britain and Ireland a strong desire to see steps taken\r\n     by the Government of this country in concert with other\r\n     Powers, to bring about peace on a durable basis between the\r\n     belligerents in North America.\r\n\r\n     \"I am directed by the Committee to express a hope that you\r\n     will, before the Session closes, support a motion in\r\n     Parliament to this effect; and should you desire to see\r\n     evidence of the feeling of a large portion of the country in\r\n     this matter, I shall be most happy to lay it before\r\n     you[1178].\"\r\n\r\nWhether Lindsay, vexed with the delays of the Association, had stirred\r\nthe Society to action, is not clear, but the date of this letter,\r\nfollowing on the day after the interview with Palmerston, is suggestive.\r\nThe pressure put on Mason to come to London was not at first successful.\r\nMason had become fixed in the opinion, arrived at in the previous fall,\r\nthat there was no favour to be expected from Palmerston or Russell and\r\nthat the only hope rested in their overthrow. Against this idea Lindsay\r\nhad now taken definite ground. Moreover, Mason had been instructed to\r\nshake the dust of England from off his shoes with no official authority\r\nto return. Carefully explaining this last point to Lindsay he declined\r\nto hold an interview with Palmerston, except on the latter's invitation,\r\nor at least suggestion:\r\n\r\n     \"Had the suggestion you make of an interview and conversation\r\n     with Lord Palmerston originated with his Lordship I might not\r\n     have felt myself prohibited by my instructions from at once\r\n     acceding to it, but as it has the form only of his assent to\r\n     a proposition from you I must with all respect decline it.\r\n\r\n     \"Although no longer accredited by my Government as Special\r\n     Commissioner to Great Britain, I am yet in Europe with full\r\n     powers, and therefore, had Lord Palmerston expressed a desire\r\n     to see me as his own act (of course unofficially, and even\r\n     without any reason assigned for the interview) I should have\r\n     had great pleasure in complying with his request[1179].\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation of disinclination to come was lengthy, but the last\r\nparagraph indicated an itching to be active in London again. Lindsay\r\nrenewed his urgings and was not only hopeful but elated over the seeming\r\nsuccess of his overtures to the Government. He had again seen Palmerston\r\nand had now pushed his proposal beyond the timid suggestion of overtures\r\nwhen the opportune moment should arrive to a definite suggestion of\r\nrecognition of the Confederacy:\r\n\r\n     \"I reasoned on the _moral_ effect of recognition, considering\r\n     that the restoration of the Union, which was utterly\r\n     hopeless, was the object which the North had in view, etc.,\r\n     etc. This reasoning appeared to produce a considerable\r\n     effect, for he appears now to be very open to conviction. He\r\n     again said that in his opinion the subjugation of the South\r\n     could not be effected by the North, and he added that he\r\n     thought the people of the North were becoming more and more\r\n     alive to the fact every day.\"\r\n\r\nLindsay's next step was to be the securing of an interview with Russell\r\nand if he was found to be equally acquiescent all would be\r\nplain sailing:\r\n\r\n     \"Now, if by strong reasoning in a quiet way, and by stern\r\n     facts we can get Lord R. to my views, I think I may say that\r\n     all difficulty so far as our Cabinet is concerned, _is at an\r\n     end_. I hope to be able to see Lord Russell alone to-morrow.\r\n     He used to pay some little attention to any opinions I\r\n     ventured to express to him, and I am _not_ without hope. I\r\n     may add that I was as frank with Lord Palmerston as he has\r\n     been pleased to be with me, and I told him at parting to-day,\r\n     that my present intention was not to proceed with the Motion\r\n     at least for 10 days or a fortnight, unless he was prepared\r\n     to support me. He highly commended this course, and seemed\r\n     much gratified with what I said. The fact is, _sub rosa_, it\r\n     is clear to me that _no_ motion will be carried unless it is\r\n     supported by the Government for it is clear that Lord Derby\r\n     is resolved to leave the responsibility with the Executive,\r\n     and therefore, _in the present state of matters_, it would\r\n     seriously injure the cause of the South to bring forward any\r\n     motion which would not be carried.\"\r\n\r\nLindsay then urges Mason to come at once to London.\r\n\r\n     \"Now apart altogether from you seeing Lord Palmerston, I must\r\n     earnestly entreat you to come here. Unless you are much\r\n     wanted in Paris, your visit here, as a private gentleman, can\r\n     do no harm, and _may, at the present moment, be of great\r\n     service to your country_[1180].\"\r\n\r\nPalmerston's willingness to listen to suggestions of what would have\r\namounted to a complete face-about of British policy on America, his\r\n\"gratification\" that Lindsay intended to postpone the parliamentary\r\nmotion, his friendly courtesy to a man whom he had but recently rebuked\r\nfor a meddlesome \"amateur diplomacy,\" can be interpreted in no other\r\nlight than an evidence of a desire to prevent Southern friends from\r\njoining in the attack, daily becoming more dangerous, on the\r\nGovernment's Danish policy. How much of this Lindsay understood is not\r\nclear; on the face of his letters to Mason he would seem to have been\r\nhoodwinked, but the more reasonable supposition is, perhaps, that much\r\nwas hoped from the governmental necessity of not alienating supporters.\r\nThe Danish situation was to be used, but without an open threat. In\r\naddition the tone of the public press, for some time gloomy over\r\nSouthern prospects, was now restored to the point of confidence and in\r\nthis the _Times_ was again leading[1181]. The Society for Promoting the\r\nCessation of Hostilities in America quickly issued another circular\r\nletter inviting Members of Parliament to join in a deputation to call on\r\nPalmerston to urge action on the lines of Lindsay's first overture.\r\nSuch a deputation would represent \"more than 5,000 members and the\r\nfeeling of probably more than twenty millions of people.\" It should not\r\nbe a deputation \"of parties\" but representative of all groups in\r\nParliament:\r\n\r\n     \"The Society has reason to believe that the Premier is\r\n     disposed to look favourably upon the attempt here\r\n     contemplated and that the weight of an influential deputation\r\n     would strengthen his hands[1182].\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal from the Society was now lagging behind Lindsay's later\r\nobjective--namely, direct recognition. That this was felt to be\r\nunfortunate is shown by a letter from Tremlett, Honorary Secretary of\r\nthe Society, to Mason. He wrote that the _Southern Independence\r\nAssociation_, finally stirred by Lindsay's insistence, had agreed to\r\njoin the Society in a representation to Palmerston but had favoured some\r\nspecific statement on recognition. Palmerston had sent word that he\r\nfavoured the Society's resolution but not that of the Association, and\r\nas a result the joint letter of the two organizations would be on the\r\nmild lines of Lindsay's original motion:\r\n\r\n     \"Although this quite expresses the object of our Society,\r\n     still I do not think the 'Independence Association' ought to\r\n     have 'ratted' from its principles. It ought not to have\r\n     consented to ignore the question which it was instituted to\r\n     bring before Parliament--that of the Independence of the\r\n     Confederacy--and more than that, the ambiguous ending of the\r\n     resolution to be submitted is not such as I think ought to be\r\n     allowed. You know the resolution and therefore I need only\r\n     quote the obnoxious words 'That Her Majesty's Government will\r\n     avail itself of the earliest opportunity of mediating, etc.'\r\n\r\n     \"This is just leaving the Government where they have been all\r\n     along. They have always professed to take 'the earliest\r\n     opportunity' but of which they are to be the judges[1183]!\"\r\n\r\nEvidently there was confusion in the ranks and disagreement among the\r\nleaders of Southern friends. Adams, always cool in judgment of where lay\r\nthe wind, wrote to Seward on this same day that Lindsay was delaying his\r\nmotion until the receipt of favourable news upon which to spring it.\r\nEven such news, Adams believed, would not alter British policy unless it\r\nshould depict the \"complete defeat and dispersion\" of Northern\r\nforces[1184]. The day following the _Times_ reported Grant to be meeting\r\nfearful reverses in Virginia and professed to regard Sherman's easy\r\nadvance toward Atlanta as but a trap set for the Northern army in the\r\nWest[1185]. But in reality the gage of battle for Southern advantage in\r\nEngland was fixed upon a European, not an American, field. Mason\r\nunderstood this perfectly. He had yielded to Lindsay's insistence and\r\nhad come to London. There he listened to Lindsay's account of the\r\ninterview (now held) with Russell, and June 8 reported it to Slidell:\r\n\r\n     \"Of his intercourse with Lord Russell he reports in substance\r\n     that his Lordship was unusually gracious and seemed well\r\n     disposed to go into conversation. Lord Russell agreed that\r\n     the war on the part of the United States was hopeless and\r\n     that neither could union be restored nor the South brought\r\n     under the yoke.... In regard to Lindsay's motion Lord Russell\r\n     said, that he could not _accept_ it, but if brought up for\r\n     discussion his side would _speak_ favourably of it. That is\r\n     to say they would commend it if they could not vote for it.\"\r\n\r\nThis referred to Lindsay's original motion of using the \"earliest\r\nopportunity of mediation,\" and the pleasant reception given by Russell\r\nscarcely justified any great hope of decided benefit for the South. It\r\nmust now have been fairly apparent to Lindsay, as it certainly was to\r\nMason, that all this complaisance by Palmerston and Russell was but\r\npolitical manipulation to retain or to secure support in the coming\r\ncontest with the Tories. The two old statesmen, wise in parliamentary\r\nmanagement, were angling for every doubtful vote. Discussing with\r\nLindsay the prospects for governmental action Mason now ventured to\r\nsuggest that perhaps the best chances of success lay with the Tories,\r\nand found him unexpectedly in agreement:\r\n\r\n     \"I told Lindsay (but for his ear only) that Mr. Hunter,\r\n     editor of the _Herald_, had written to Hotze about his\r\n     connection with Disraeli, and he said at once, that if the\r\n     latter took it up in earnest, it could not be in better hands\r\n     and would carry at the expense of the Ministry and that he\r\n     would most cheerfully and eagerly yield him the _pas_.\r\n     Disraeli's accession, as you remember, was contingent upon\r\n     our success in Virginia--and agreeing entirely with Lindsay\r\n     that the movement could not be in better hands and as there\r\n     were but 10 days before his motion could again come, I\r\n     thought the better policy would be for the present that he\r\n     should be silent and to await events[1186].\"\r\n\r\nSlidell was less sceptical than was Mason but agreed that it might best\r\nadvantage the South to be rid of Russell:\r\n\r\n     \"If Russell can be trusted, which to me is very doubtful,\r\n     Lindsay's motion must succeed. Query, how would its being\r\n     brought forward by Disraeli affect Russell's action--if he\r\n     can be beaten on a fair issue it would be better for us\r\n     perhaps than if it appeared to be carried with his qualified\r\n     assent[1187].\"\r\n\r\nBut Mason understood that Southern expectation of a change in British\r\npolicy toward America must rest (and even then but doubtfully) on a\r\nchange of Government. By June 29 his personal belief was that the Tory\r\nattack on the Danish question would be defeated and that this would \"of\r\ncourse postpone Lindsay's projected motion[1188].\" On June 25, the\r\nDanish Conference had ended and the Prussian war with Denmark was\r\nrenewed. There was a general feeling of shame over Palmerston's bluster\r\nfollowed by a meek British inaction. The debate came on a vote of\r\ncensure, July 8, in the course of which Derby characterized governmental\r\npolicy as one of \"meddle and muddle.\" The censure was carried in the\r\nLords by nine votes, but was defeated in the Commons by a ministerial\r\nmajority of eighteen. It was the sharpest political crisis of\r\nPalmerston's Ministry during the Civil War. Every supporting vote was\r\nneeded[1189].\r\n\r\nNot only had Lindsay's motion been postponed but the interview with\r\nPalmerston for which Mason had come to London had also been deferred in\r\nview of the parliamentary crisis. When finally held on July 14, it\r\nresolved itself into a proud and emphatic assertion by Mason that the\r\nSouth could not be conquered, that the North was nearly ready to\r\nacknowledge it and that the certainty of Lincoln's defeat in the coming\r\nPresidential election was proof of this. Palmerston appears to have\r\nsaid little.\r\n\r\n     \"At the conclusion I said to him in reply to his remark, that\r\n     he was gratified in making my acquaintance, that I felt\r\n     obliged by his invitation to the interview, but that the\r\n     obligation would be increased if I could take with me any\r\n     expectation that the Government of Her Majesty was prepared\r\n     to unite with France, in some act expressive of their sense\r\n     that the war should come to an end. He said, that perhaps, as\r\n     I was of opinion that the crisis was at hand, it might be\r\n     better to wait until it had arrived. I told him that my\r\n     opinion was that the crisis had passed, at least so far as\r\n     that the war of invasion would end with the campaign[1190].\"\r\n\r\nReporting the interview to Slidell in much the same language, Mason\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     \"My own impressions derived from the whole interview are,\r\n     that [while] P. is as well satisfied as I am, that the\r\n     separation of the States is final and the independence of the\r\n     South an accomplished fact, the Ministry fears to move under\r\n     the menaces of the North[1191].\"\r\n\r\nSlidell's comment was bitter:\r\n\r\n     \"I am very much obliged for your account of your interview\r\n     with Lord Palmerston. It resulted very much as I had\r\n     anticipated excepting that his Lordship appears to have said\r\n     even less than I had supposed he would. However, the time has\r\n     now arrived when it is comparatively of very little\r\n     importance what Queen or Emperor may say or think about us. A\r\n     plague, I say, on both your Houses[1192].\"\r\n\r\nSlidell's opinion from this time on was, indeed, that the South had\r\nnothing to expect from Europe until the North itself should acknowledge\r\nthe independence of the Confederacy. July 21, _The Index_ expressed much\r\nthe same view and was equally bitter. It quoted an item in the _Morning\r\nHerald_ of July 16, to the effect that Mason had secured an interview\r\nwith Palmerston and that \"the meeting was satisfactory to all parties\":\r\n\r\n     \"The withdrawal of Mr. Lindsay's motion was, it is said, the\r\n     result of that interview, the Premier having given a sort of\r\n     implied promise to support it at a more opportune moment;\r\n     that is to say, when Grant and Sherman have been defeated,\r\n     and the Confederacy stand in no need of recognition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same issue _The Index_ described a deputation of clergymen,\r\nnoblemen, Members of Parliament \"and other distinguished and influential\r\ngentlemen\" who had waited upon Palmerston to urge mediation toward a\r\ncessation of hostilities in America. Thus at last the joint project of\r\nthe Southern Independence Association and of the Society for Promoting\r\nthe Cessation of Hostilities in America had been put in execution\r\n_after_ the political storm had passed and not before--when the\r\ndeputation might have had some influence. But the fact was that no\r\ndeputation, unless a purely party one, could have been collected before\r\nthe conclusion of the Danish crisis. When finally assembled it \"had no\r\nparty complexion,\" and the smiling readiness with which it received\r\nPalmerston's jocular reply indicating that Britain's safest policy was\r\nto keep strictly to neutrality is evidence that even the deputation\r\nitself though harassed by Lindsay and others into making this\r\ndemonstration, was quite content to let well enough alone. Not so _The\r\nIndex_ which sneered at the childishness of Palmerston:\r\n\r\n     \"... He proved incontestably to his visitors that, though he\r\n     has been charged with forgetting the vigour of his prime, he\r\n     can in old age remember the lessons of his childhood, by\r\n     telling them that\r\n\r\n     They who in quarrels interpose\r\n     Will often wipe a bloody nose (laughter)--\r\n\r\n     a quotation which, in the mouth of the Prime Minister of the\r\n     British Empire, and on such an occasion, must be admitted as\r\n     not altogether unworthy of Abraham Lincoln himself[1193].\"\r\n\r\nSpence took consolation in the fact that Mason had at last come into\r\npersonal contact with Palmerston, \"even now at his great age a charming\r\ncontrast to that piece of small human pipe-clay, Lord Russell[1194].\"\r\nBut the whole incident of Lindsay's excited efforts, Mason's journey to\r\nLondon and interview with Palmerston, and the deputation, left a bad\r\ntaste in the mouth of the more determined friends of the South--of those\r\nwho were Confederates rather than Englishmen. They felt that they had\r\nbeen deceived and toyed with by the Government. Mason's return to London\r\nwas formally approved at Richmond but Benjamin wrote that the argument\r\nfor recognition advanced to Palmerston had laid too much stress on the\r\nbreak-down of the North. All that was wanted was recognition which was\r\ndue the South from the mere facts of the existing situation, and\r\nrecognition, if accorded, would have at once ended the war without\r\nintervention in any form[1195]. Similarly _The Index_ stated that\r\nmediation was an English notion, not a Southern one. The South merely\r\ndesired justice, that is, recognition[1196]. This was a bold front yet\r\none not unwarranted by the military situation in midsummer of 1864, as\r\nreported in the press. Sherman's western campaign toward Atlanta had but\r\njust started and little was known of the strength of his army or of the\r\npowers of Southern resistance. This campaign was therefore regarded as\r\nof minor importance. It was on Grant's advance toward Richmond that\r\nBritish attention was fixed; Lee's stiff resistance, the great losses of\r\nthe North in battle after battle and finally the settling down by Grant\r\nto besiege the Southern lines at Petersburg, in late June, 1864, seemed\r\nto indicate that once again an offensive in Virginia to \"end the war\"\r\nwas doomed to that failure which had marked the similar efforts of each\r\nof the three preceding years.\r\n\r\nSouthern efforts in England to alter British neutrality practically\r\nended with Lindsay's proposed but undebated motion of June, 1864, but\r\nBritish confidence in Southern ability to defend herself indefinitely, a\r\nconfidence somewhat shattered at the beginning of 1864--had renewed its\r\nstrength by July. For the next six months this was to be the note harped\r\nupon in society, by organizations, and in the friendly press.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1129: Mason Papers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1130: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1131: _Ibid._, Spence to Mason, Dec. 7, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1132: _The Index_, Dec. 10, 1863, p. 518.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1133: The success of pro-Northern meetings in London was\r\nignored.

Throughout and even\r\nsince the war the charge has been made by the South that the foreign\r\nelement, after 1862, preponderated in Northern armies. There is no way\r\nof determining the exact facts in regard to this for no statistics were\r\nkept. A Memorandum prepared by the U.S. War Department, dated July 15,\r\n1898, states that of the men examined for physical fitness by the\r\nseveral boards of enrolment, subsequent to September 1, 1864 (at which\r\ntime, if ever, the foreign element should have shown preponderance), the\r\nfigures of nativity stood: United States, 341,569; Germany, 54,944;\r\nIreland, 50,537; British-America, 21,645; England, 16,196; and various\r\nother countries no one of which reached the 3,500 mark. These statistics\r\nreally mean little as regards war-time immigration since they do not\r\nshow _when_ the foreign-born came to America; further, from the very\r\nfirst days of the war there had been a large element of American\r\ncitizens of German and Irish birth in the Northern armies. Moreover, the\r\nBritish statistics of emigration, examined in relation to the figures\r\ngiven above, negative the Southern accusation. In 1861, but 38,000\r\nsubjects of Great Britain emigrated to the United States; in 1862,\r\n48,000; while in 1863 the number suddenly swelled to 130,000, and this\r\nfigure was repeated in 1864. In each year almost exactly two-thirds were\r\nfrom Ireland. Now of the 94,000 from Ireland in 1863, considering the\r\nnumber of Irish-American citizens already in the army, it is evident\r\nthat the bulk must have gone into labour supply.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1164: _Parliamentary Papers_, 1863, _Commons_, LXXII.\r\n\"Correspondence with Mr. Adams respecting enlistment of British\r\nsubjects.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1165: The _Times_, Nov. 21, 1863.

To the\r\nEuropean neutral the situation was much as in the Great War it appeared\r\nto the American neutral in December, 1916, at the end of two years of\r\nfighting. In both wars the neutral had expected and had prophesied a\r\nshort conflict. In both, this had proved to be false prophecy and with\r\neach additional month of the Civil War there was witnessed an increase\r\nof the forces employed and a psychological change in the people whereby\r\nwar seemed to have become a normal state of society. The American Civil\r\nWar, as regards continuity, numbers of men steadily engaged, resources\r\nemployed, and persistence of the combatants, was the \"Great War,\" to\r\ndate, of all modern conflicts. Not only British, but nearly all foreign\r\nobservers were of the opinion by midsummer of 1864, after an apparent\r\ncheck to Grant in his campaign toward Richmond, that all America had\r\nbecome engaged in a struggle from which there was scant hope of\r\nemergence by a decisive military victory. There was little knowledge of\r\nthe steady decline of the resources of the South even though Jefferson\r\nDavis in a message to the Confederate Congress in February, 1864, had\r\nspoken bitterly of Southern disorganization[1197]. Yet this belief in\r\nstalemate in essence still postulated an ultimate Southern victory, for\r\nthe function of the Confederacy was, after all, to _resist_ until its\r\nindependence was recognized. Ardent friends of the North in England both\r\nfelt and expressed confidence in the outcome, but the general attitude\r\nof neutral England leaned rather to faith in the powers of indefinite\r\nSouthern resistance, so loudly voiced by Southern champions.\r\n\r\nThere was now one element in the situation, however, that hampered these\r\nSouthern champions. The North was at last fully identified with the\r\ncause of emancipation; the South with the perpetuation of slavery. By\r\n1864, it was felt to be impossible to remain silent on this subject and\r\neven in the original constitution and address of the Southern\r\nIndependence Association a clause was adopted expressing a hope for the\r\ngradual extinction of slavery[1198]. This brought Mason some\r\nheartburnings and he wrote to Spence in protest, the latter's reply\r\nbeing that he also agreed that the South ought not to be offered\r\ngratuitous advice on what was purely \"an internal question,\" but that\r\nthe topic was full of difficulties and the clause would have to stand,\r\nat least in some modified form. At Southern public meetings, also, there\r\narose a tendency to insert in resolutions similar expressions. \"In\r\nManchester,\" Spence wrote, \"Mr. Lees, J.P., and the strongest man on the\r\nboard, brought forward a motion for an address on this subject. I went\r\nup to Manchester purposely to quash it and I did so effectually[1199].\"\r\n\r\nNorthern friends were quick to strike at this weakness in Southern\r\narmour; they repeatedly used a phrase, \"The Foul Blot,\" and by mere\r\niteration gave such currency to it that even in Southern meetings it was\r\nrepeated. _The Index_, as early as February, 1864, felt compelled to\r\nmeet the phrase and in an editorial, headed \"The Foul Blot,\" argued the\r\nerror of Southern friends. As long as they could use the word \"blot\" in\r\ncharacterization of Southern slavery, _The Index_ felt that there could\r\nbe no effective British push for Southern independence and it asserted\r\nthat slavery, in the sense in which England understood it, did not exist\r\nin the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     \"... It is truly horrible to reduce human beings to the\r\n     condition of cattle, to breed them, to sell them, and\r\n     otherwise dispose of them, as cattle. But is it defending\r\n     such practices to say that the South does none of these\r\n     things, but that on the contrary, both in theory and in\r\n     practice, she treats the negro as a fellow-creature, with a\r\n     soul to be saved, with feelings to be respected, though in\r\n     the social order in a subordinate place, and of an\r\n     intellectual organization which requires guardianship with\r\n     mutual duties and obligations? This system is called slavery,\r\n     because it developed itself out of an older and very\r\n     different one of that name, but for this the South is not\r\n     to blame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"But of this the friends of the South may be assured, that so\r\n     long as they make no determined effort to relieve the\r\n     Southern character from this false drapery, they will never\r\n     gain for it that respect, that confidence in the rectitude of\r\n     Southern motives, that active sympathy, which can alone evoke\r\n     effective assistance.... The best assurance you can give that\r\n     the destinies of the negro race are safe in Southern hands\r\n     is, not that the South will repent and reform, but that she\r\n     has consistently and conscientiously been the friend and\r\n     benefactor of that race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"It is, therefore, always with pain that we hear such\r\n     expressions as 'the foul blot,' and similar ones, fall from\r\n     the lips of earnest promoters of Confederate Independence. As\r\n     a concession they are useless; as a confession they are\r\n     untrue.... Thus the Southerner may retort as we have seen\r\n     that an Englishman would retort for his country. He might say\r\n     the South is proud, and of nothing more proud than this--not\r\n     that she has slaves, but that she has treated them as slaves\r\n     never were treated before, that she has used power as no\r\n     nation ever used it under similar circumstances, and that she\r\n     has solved mercifully and humanely a most difficult problem\r\n     which has elsewhere defied solution save in blood. Or he\r\n     might use the unspoken reflection of an honest Southerner at\r\n     hearing much said of 'the foul blot': 'It was indeed a dark\r\n     and damnable blot that England left us with, and it required\r\n     all the efforts of Southern Christianity to pale it as it now\r\n     is[1200].'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1862 and to the fall of 1863, _The Index_ had declared that slavery\r\nwas not an issue in the war; now its defence of the \"domestic\r\ninstitution\" of the South, repeatedly made in varying forms, was\r\nevidence of the great effect in England of Lincoln's emancipation\r\nedicts. _The Index_ could not keep away from the subject. In March,\r\nquotations were given from the _Reader_, with adverse comments, upon a\r\nreport of a controversy aroused in scientific circles by a paper read\r\nbefore the Anthropological Society of London. James Hunt was the author\r\nand the paper, entitled \"The Negro's Place in Nature,\" aroused the\r\ncontempt of Huxley who criticized it at the meeting as unscientific and\r\nplaced upon it the \"stigma of public condemnation.\" The result was a\r\nfine controversy among the scientists which could only serve to\r\nemphasize the belief that slavery was indeed an issue in the American\r\nWar and that the South was on the defensive. Winding up a newspaper duel\r\nwith Hunt who emerged rather badly mauled, Huxley asserted \"the North is\r\njustified in any expenditure of blood or treasure which shall eradicate\r\na system hopelessly inconsistent with the moral elevation, the political\r\nfreedom, or the economical progress of the American people[1201]....\"\r\n\r\nEmbarrassment caused by the \"Foul Blot\" issue, the impossibility to many\r\nsincere Southern friends of accepting the view-point of _The Index_,\r\nacted as a check upon the holding of public meetings and prevented the\r\ncarrying out of that intensive public campaign launched by Spence and\r\nintended to be fostered by the Southern Independence Association. By the\r\nend of June, 1864, there was almost a complete cessation of Southern\r\nmeetings, not thereafter renewed, except spasmodically for a brief\r\nperiod in the fall just before the Presidential election in\r\nAmerica[1202]. Northern meetings were continuous throughout the whole\r\nperiod of the war but were less frequent in 1864 than in 1863. They were\r\nalmost entirely of two types--those held by anti-slavery societies and\r\nreligious bodies and those organized for, or by, working men. An\r\nanalysis of those recorded in the files of _The Liberator_, and\r\nin the reports sent by Adams to Seward permits the following\r\nclassification[1203]:\r\n\r\n     YEAR.

Dr. Cheever, Rev. Newman Hall, John\r\nBright, Professor Newman, Mr. Bagley, M.P., Rev. Francis Bishop, P.A.\r\nTaylor, M.P., William Evans, Thomas Bayley Potter, F.W. Chesson and\r\nMason Jones. While held in all parts of England and Scotland the great\r\nmajority of meetings were held in London and in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts with Manchester as a centre. From the first the old\r\nanti-slavery orator of the 'thirties, George Thompson, had been the most\r\nactive speaker and was credited by all with having given new life to the\r\nmoribund emancipation sentiment of Great Britain[1204]. Thompson\r\nasserted that by the end of 1863 there was a \"vigilant, active and\r\nenergetic\" anti-slavery society in almost every great town or\r\ncity[1205]. Among the working-men, John Bright was without question the\r\nmost popular advocate of the Northern cause, but there were many others,\r\nnot named in the preceding list, constantly active and effective[1206].\r\nForster, in the judgment of many, was the most influential friend of the\r\nNorth in Parliament, but Bright, also an influence in Parliament,\r\nrendered his chief service in moulding the opinion of Lancashire and\r\nbecame to American eyes their great English champion, a view attested\r\nby the extraordinary act of President Lincoln in pardoning, on the\r\nappeal of Bright, and in his honour, a young Englishman named Alfred\r\nRubery, who had become involved in a plot to send out from the port of\r\nSan Francisco, a Confederate \"privateer\" to prey on Northern\r\ncommerce[1207].\r\n\r\nThis record of the activities of Northern friends and organizations, the\r\nrelative subsidence of their efforts in the latter part of 1864, thus\r\nindicating their confidence in Northern victory, the practical cessation\r\nof public Southern meetings, are nevertheless no proof that the bulk of\r\nEnglish opinion had greatly wavered in its faith in Southern powers of\r\nresistance. The Government, it is true, was better informed and was\r\nexceedingly anxious to tread gently in relations with the North, the\r\nmore so as there was now being voiced by the public in America a\r\nsentiment of extreme friendship for Russia as the \"true friend\" in\r\nopposition to the \"unfriendly neutrality\" of Great Britain and\r\nFrance[1208]. It was a period of many minor irritations, arising out of\r\nthe blockade, inflicted by America on British interests, but to these\r\nRussell paid little attention except to enter formal protests. He\r\nwrote to Lyons:\r\n\r\n     \"I do not want to pick a quarrel out of our many just causes\r\n     of complaint. But it will be as well that Lincoln and Seward\r\n     should see that we are long patient, and do nothing to\r\n     distract their attention from the arduous task they have so\r\n     wantonly undertaken[1209].\"\r\n\r\nLyons was equally desirous of avoiding frictions. In August he thought\r\nthat the current of political opinion was running against the\r\nre-election of Lincoln, noting that the Northern papers were full of\r\nexpressions favouring an armistice, but pointed out that neither the\r\n\"peace party\" nor the advocates of an armistice ever talked of any\r\nsolution of the war save on the basis of re-union. Hence Lyons strongly\r\nadvised that \"the quieter England and France were just at this moment\r\nthe better[1210].\" Even the suggested armistice was not thought of, he\r\nstated, as extending to a relaxation of the blockade. Of military\r\nprobabilities, Lyons professed himself to be no judge, but throughout\r\nall his letters there now ran, as for some time previously, a note of\r\nwarning as to the great power and high determination of the North.\r\n\r\nBut if the British Government was now quietly operating upon the theory\r\nof an ultimate Northern victory, or at least with the view that the only\r\nhope for the South lay in a Northern weariness of war, the leading\r\nBritish newspapers were still indulging in expressions of confidence in\r\nthe South while at the same time putting much faith in the expected\r\ndefeat of Lincoln at the polls. As always at this period, save for the\r\nfew newspapers avowedly friendly to the North and one important daily\r\nprofessing strict neutrality--the _Telegraph_--the bulk of the\r\nmetropolitan press took its cue, as well as much of its war news, from\r\nthe columns of the _Times_. This journal, while early assuming a\r\nposition of belief in Southern success, had yet given both sides in the\r\nwar fair accuracy in its reports--those of the New York correspondent,\r\nMackay, always excepted. But from June, 1864, a change came over the\r\n_Times_; it was either itself deceived or was wilfully deceiving its\r\nreaders, for steadily every event for the rest of the year was coloured\r\nto create an impression of the unlimited powers of Southern resistance.\r\nRead to-day in the light of modern knowledge of the military situation\r\nthroughout the war, the _Times_ gave accurate reports for the earlier\r\nyears but became almost hysterical; not to say absurd, for the last year\r\nof the conflict. Early in June, 1864, Grant was depicted as meeting\r\nreverses in Virginia and as definitely checked, while Sherman in the\r\nWest was being drawn into a trap in his march toward Atlanta[1211]. The\r\nsame ideas were repeated throughout July. Meanwhile there had begun to\r\nbe printed a series of letters from a Southern correspondent at Richmond\r\nwho wrote in contempt of Grant's army.\r\n\r\n     \"I am at a loss to convey to you the contemptuous tone in\r\n     which the tried and war-worn soldiers of General Lee talk of\r\n     the huddled rabble of black, white, and copper-coloured\r\n     victims (there are Indians serving under the Stars and\r\n     Stripes) who are at times goaded up to the Southern lines....\r\n     The truth is that for the first time in modern warfare we are\r\n     contemplating an army which is at once republican and\r\n     undisciplined[1212].\"\r\n\r\nAt the moment when such effusions could find a place in London's leading\r\npaper the facts of the situation were that the South was unable to\r\nprevent almost daily desertions and was wholly unable to spare soldiers\r\nto recover and punish the deserters. But on this the _Times_ was either\r\nignorant or wilfully silent. It was indeed a general British sentiment\r\nduring the summer of 1864, that the North was losing its power and\r\ndetermination in the war[1213], even though it was unquestioned that the\r\nearlier \"enthusiasm for the slave-holders\" had passed away[1214]. One\r\nelement in the influence of the _Times_ was its _seeming_ impartiality\r\naccompanied by a pretentious assertion of superior information and\r\nwisdom that at times irritated its contemporaries, but was recognized as\r\nmaking this journal the most powerful agent in England. Angry at a\r\n_Times_ editorial in February, 1863, in which Mason had been berated for\r\na speech made at the Lord Mayor's banquet, _The Index_ declared:\r\n\r\n     \"Our contemporary is all things to all men. It not only\r\n     shouts with the largest crowd, according to the Pickwickian\r\n     philosophy, but with a skill and daring that command\r\n     admiration, it shouts simultaneously with opposite and\r\n     contending crowds. It is everybody's _Times_[1215].\"\r\n\r\nYet _The Index_ knew, and frequently so stated, that the _Times_ was at\r\nbottom pro-Southern. John Bright's medium, the _Morning Star_, said:\r\n\"There was something bordering on the sublime in the tremendous audacity\r\nof the war news supplied by the _Times_. Of course, its prophecies were\r\nin a similar style. None of your doubtful oracles there; none of your\r\ndouble-meaning vaticinations, like that which took poor Pyrrhus\r\nin[1216].\" In short, the _Times_ became for the last year of the war the\r\nBible of their faith to Southern sympathizers, and was frequent in its\r\npreachments[1217].\r\n\r\nThere was one journal in London which claimed to have equal if not\r\ngreater knowledge and authority in military matters. This was the weekly\r\n_Army and Navy Gazette_, and its editor, W.H. Russell, in 1861 war\r\ncorrespondent in America of the _Times_, but recalled shortly after his\r\nfamous letter on the battle of Bull Run, consistently maintained after\r\nthe war had ended that he had always asserted the ultimate victory of\r\nthe North and was, indeed, so pro-Northern in sentiment that this was\r\nthe real cause of his recall[1218]. He even claimed to have believed in\r\nNorthern victory to the extent of re-union. These protestations after\r\nthe event are not borne out by the columns of the _Gazette_, for that\r\njournal was not far behind the _Times_ in its delineation of incidents\r\nunfavourable to the North and in its all-wise prophecies of Northern\r\ndisaster. The _Gazette_ had no wide circulation except among those in\r\nthe service, but its _dicta_, owing to the established reputation of\r\nRussell and to the specialist nature of the paper, were naturally quite\r\nreadily accepted and repeated in the ordinary press. Based on a correct\r\nappreciation of man power and resources the _Gazette_ did from time to\r\ntime proclaim its faith in Northern victory[1219], but always in such\r\nterms as to render possible a hedge on expressed opinion and always with\r\nthe assertion that victory would not result in reunion. Russell's most\r\ndefinite prophecy was made on July 30, 1864:\r\n\r\n     \"The Southern Confederacy, like Denmark, is left to fight by\r\n     itself, without even a conference or an armistice to aid it;\r\n     and it will be strange indeed if the heroism, endurance, and\r\n     resources of its soldiers and citizens be not eventually\r\n     dominated by the perseverance and superior means of the\r\n     Northern States. Let us repeat our profession of faith in the\r\n     matter. We hold that the Union perished long ago, and that\r\n     its component parts can never again be welded into a\r\n     Confederacy of self-governing States, with a common\r\n     executive, army, fleet, and central government. Not only\r\n     that. The principle of Union itself among the non-seceding\r\n     States is so shocked and shattered by the war which has\r\n     arisen, that the fissures in it are likely to widen and\r\n     spread, and to form eventually great gulfs separating the\r\n     Northern Union itself into smaller bodies. But ere the North\r\n     be convinced of the futility of its efforts to substitute the\r\n     action of force for that of free will, we think it will\r\n     reduce the Southern States to the direst misery[1220]....\"\r\n\r\nSuch occasional \"professions of faith,\" accompanied by sneers at the\r\n\"Confederate partisanship\" of the _Times_[1221] served to differentiate\r\nthe _Gazette_ from other journals, but when it came to description and\r\nestimate of specific campaigns there was little to choose between them\r\nand consequently little variance in the effect upon the public. Thus a\r\nfortnight before his \"profession of faith,\" Russell could comment\r\neditorially on Sherman's campaign toward Atlanta:\r\n\r\n     \"The next great Federal army on which the hopes of the North\r\n     have so long been fixed promises to become a source of\r\n     fearful anxiety. Sherman, if not retreating, is certainly not\r\n     advancing; and, if the Confederates can interfere seriously\r\n     with his communications, he must fall back as soon as he has\r\n     eaten up all the supplies of the district.... All the\r\n     enormous advantages possessed by the Federals have been\r\n     nullified by want of skill, by the interference of Washington\r\n     civilians, and by the absence of an animating homogeneous\r\n     spirit on the part of their soldiery[1222].\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand with war news adverse to the North went comments on the\r\nPresidential election campaign in America, with prophecies of Lincoln's\r\ndefeat. This was indeed but a reflection of the American press but the\r\ncitations made in British papers emphasized especially Northern\r\nweariness of Lincoln's despotism and inefficiency. Thus, first printed\r\nin _The Index_, an extract from a New York paper, _The New Nation_, got\r\nfrequent quotation:\r\n\r\n     \"We have been imposed upon long enough. The ruin which you\r\n     have been unable to accomplish in four years, would certainly\r\n     be fully consummated were you to remain in power four years\r\n     longer. Your military governors and their provost-marshals\r\n     override the laws, and the _echo of the armed heel rings\r\n     forth as dearly now in America as in France or Austria. You\r\n     have encroached upon our liberty without securing victory,\r\n     and we must have both_[1223].\"\r\n\r\nIt was clearly understood that Northern military efforts would have an\r\nimportant bearing on the election. The _Times_ while expressing\r\nadmiration for Sherman's boldness in the Atlanta campaign was confident\r\nof his defeat:\r\n\r\n     \"... it is difficult to see how General Sherman can escape a\r\n     still more disastrous fate than that which threatened his\r\n     predecessor. He has advanced nearly one hundred and fifty\r\n     miles from his base of operations, over a mountainous\r\n     country; and he has no option but to retreat by the same line\r\n     as he advanced. This is the first instance of a Federal\r\n     general having ventured far from water communications. That\r\n     Sherman has hitherto done so with success is a proof of both\r\n     courage and ability, but he will need both these qualities in\r\n     a far greater degree if he is forced to retreat[1224].\"\r\n\r\nAnd W.H. Russell, in the _Gazette_, included Grant in the approaching\r\ndisaster:\r\n\r\n     \"The world has never seen anything in war so slow and fatuous\r\n     as Grant's recent movements, except it be those of Sherman.\r\n     Each is wriggling about like a snake in the presence of an\r\n     ichneumon. They both work round and round, now on one flank\r\n     and then on the other, and on each move meet the unwinking\r\n     eye of the enemy, ready for his spring and bite. In sheer\r\n     despair Grant and Sherman must do something at last. As to\r\n     shelling! Will they learn from history? Then they will know\r\n     that they cannot shell an army provided with as powerful\r\n     artillery as their own out of a position.... The Northerners\r\n     have, indeed, lost the day solely owing to the want of\r\n     average ability in their leaders in the field[1225].\"\r\n\r\nOn the very day when Russell thus wrote in the _Gazette_ the city of\r\nAtlanta had been taken by Sherman. When the news reached England the\r\n_Times_ having declared this impossible, now asserted that it was\r\nunimportant, believed that Sherman could not remain in possession and,\r\ntwo days later, turned with vehemence to an analysis of the political\r\nstruggle as of more vital influence. The Democrats, it was insisted,\r\nwould place peace \"paramount to union\" and were sure to win[1226].\r\nRussell, in the _Gazette_, coolly ignoring its prophecy of three weeks\r\nearlier, now spoke as if he had always foreseen the fall of Atlanta:\r\n\r\n     \"General Sherman has fully justified his reputation as an\r\n     able and daring soldier; and the final operations by which he\r\n     won Atlanta are not the least remarkable of the series which\r\n     carried him from Chattanooga ... into the heart of\r\n     Georgia[1227].\"\r\n\r\nBut neither of these political-military \"expert\" journals would\r\nacknowledge any benefit accruing to Lincoln from Sherman's success. Not\r\nso, however, Lyons, who kept his chief much better informed than he\r\nwould have been if credulous of the British press. Lyons, who for some\r\ntime had been increasingly in bad health, had sought escape from the\r\nsummer heat of Washington in a visit to Montreal. He now wrote correctly\r\ninterpreting a great change in Northern attitude and a renewed\r\ndetermination to persevere in the war until reunion was secured.\r\nLincoln, he thought, was likely to be re-elected:\r\n\r\n     \"The reaction produced by the fall of Atlanta may be taken as\r\n     an indication of what the real feelings of the people in the\r\n     Northern States are. The vast majority of them ardently\r\n     desire to reconquer the lost territory. It is only at moments\r\n     when they despair of doing this that they listen to plans for\r\n     recovering the territory by negotiation. The time has not\r\n     come yet when any proposal to relinquish the territory can be\r\n     publicly made[1228].\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, slowly convinced that Atlanta would have influence in the\r\nelection, and as always clever above its contemporaries in the delicate\r\nprocess of face-about to save its prestige, arrived in October at the\r\npoint where it could join in prediction of Lincoln's re-election. It did\r\nso by throwing the blame on the Democratic platform adopted at the party\r\nconvention in Chicago, which, so it represented, had cast away an\r\nexcellent chance of success by declaring for union first and peace\r\nafterwards. Since the convention had met in August this was late\r\nanalysis; and as a matter of fact the convention platform had called for\r\na \"cessation of bloodshed\" and the calling of a convention to restore\r\npeace--in substance, for an armistice. But the _Times_[1229] now assumed\r\ntemporarily a highly moral and disinterested pose and washed its hands\r\nof further responsibility; Lincoln was likely to be re-elected:\r\n\r\n     For ourselves we have no particular reason to wish it\r\n     otherwise. We have no very serious matter of complaint that\r\n     we are aware of against the present Government of America.\r\n     Allowance being made for the difficulties of their position,\r\n     they are conducting the war with a fair regard to the rights\r\n     of neutral nations. The war has swept American commerce from\r\n     the sea, and placed it, in great measure, in our hands; we\r\n     have supplied the loss of the cotton which was suddenly\r\n     withdrawn from us; the returns of our revenue and our trade\r\n     are thoroughly satisfactory, and we have received an\r\n     equivalent for the markets closed to us in America in the\r\n     vast impulse that has been given towards the development of\r\n     the prosperity of India. We see a great nation, which has not\r\n     been in times past sparing of its menaces and predictions of\r\n     our ruin, apparently resolved to execute, without pause and\r\n     without remorse, the most dreadful judgments of Heaven upon\r\n     itself. We see the frantic patient tearing the bandages from\r\n     his wounds and thrusting aside the hand that would assuage\r\n     his miseries, and every day that the war goes on we see less\r\n     and less probability that the great fabric of the Union will\r\n     ever be reconstructed in its original form, and more and more\r\n     likelihood that the process of disintegration will extend far\r\n     beyond the present division between North and South.... Were\r\n     we really animated by the spirit of hostility which is always\r\n     assumed to prevail among us towards America, we should view\r\n     the terrible spectacle with exultation and delight, we should\r\n     rejoice that the American people, untaught by past\r\n     misfortunes, have resolved to continue the war to the end,\r\n     and hail the probable continuance of the power of Mr. Lincoln\r\n     as the event most calculated to pledge the nation to a steady\r\n     continuance in its suicidal policy. But we are persuaded that\r\n     the people of this country view the prospect of another four\r\n     years of war in America with very different feelings. They\r\n     are not able to divest themselves of sympathy for a people of\r\n     their own blood and language thus wilfully rushing down the\r\n     path that leadeth to destruction[1230].\r\n\r\nSherman's capture of Atlanta did indeed make certain that Lincoln would\r\nagain be chosen President, but the _Times_ was more slow to acknowledge\r\nits military importance, first hinting and then positively asserting\r\nthat Sherman had fallen into a trap from which he would have difficulty\r\nin escaping[1231]. The _Gazette_ called this \"blind partisanship[1232],\"\r\nbut itself indulged in gloomy prognostications as to the character and\r\nresults of the Presidential election, regarding it as certain that\r\nelection day would see the use of \"force, fraud and every mechanism\r\nknown to the most unscrupulous political agitation.\" \"We confess,\" it\r\ncontinued, \"we are only so far affected by the struggle inasmuch as it\r\ndishonours the Anglo-Saxon name, and diminishes its reputation for\r\njustice and honour throughout the world[1233].\" Again official England\r\nwas striking a note far different from that of the press[1234]. Adams\r\npaid little attention to newspaper utterances, but kept his chief\r\ninformed of opinions expressed by those responsible for, and active in\r\ndetermining, governmental policy. The autumn \"season for speeches\" by\r\nMembers of Parliament, he reported, was progressing with a very evident\r\nunanimity of expressions, whether from friend or foe, that it was\r\ninexpedient to meddle in American affairs. As the Presidential election\r\nin America came nearer, attention was diverted from military events.\r\nAnti-slavery societies began to hold meetings urging their friends in\r\nAmerica to vote for Lincoln[1235]. Writing from Washington, Lyons, as\r\nalways anxious to forestall frictions on immaterial matters, wrote to\r\nRussell, \"We must be prepared for demonstrations of a '_spirited foreign\r\npolicy_' by Mr. Seward, during the next fortnight, for electioneering\r\npurposes[1236].\" Possibly his illness made him unduly nervous, for four\r\ndays later he was relieved to be asked by Seward to \"postpone as much as\r\npossible all business with him until after the election[1237].\" By\r\nNovember 1, Lyons was so ill that he asked for immediate leave, and in\r\nreplying, \"You will come away at once,\" Russell added that he was\r\nentirely convinced the United States wished to make no serious\r\ndifficulties with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"... I do not think the U.S. Government have any\r\n     ill-intentions towards us, or any fixed purpose of availing\r\n     themselves of a tide of success to add a war with us to their\r\n     existing difficulties. Therefore whatever their bluster and\r\n     buncome may be at times, I think they will subside when the\r\n     popular clamour is over[1238].\"\r\n\r\nIn early November, Lincoln was triumphantly re-elected receiving 212\r\nelectoral votes to 21 cast for McClellan. No disturbances such as the\r\n_Gazette_ had gloomily foretold attended the event, and the tremendous\r\nmajority gained by the President somewhat stunned the press. Having\r\nprophesied disorders, the _Gazette_ now patted America on the back for\r\nher behaviour, but took occasion to renew old \"professions of faith\"\r\nagainst reunion:\r\n\r\n     \"Abraham Lincoln II reigns in succession to Abraham Lincoln\r\n     I, the first Republican monarch of the Federal States, and so\r\n     far as we are concerned we are very glad of it, because the\r\n     measure of the man is taken and known.... It is most\r\n     creditable to the law-abiding habits of the people that the\r\n     elections ... passed off as they have done.... Mr. Lincoln\r\n     has four long years of strife before him; and as he seems\r\n     little inclined to change his advisers, his course of action,\r\n     or his generals, we do not believe that the termination of\r\n     his second period of government will find him President of\r\n     the United States[1239].\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ was disinclined, for once, to moralize, and was cautious in\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since he found himself firmly established in his\r\n     office, and the first effervescence of national feeling had\r\n     begun to subside, we have had no great reason to complain of\r\n     the conduct of Mr. Lincoln towards England. His tone has been\r\n     less exacting, his language has been less offensive and, due\r\n     allowance being made for the immense difficulties of his\r\n     situation, we could have parted with Mr. Lincoln, had such\r\n     been the pleasure of the American people, without any vestige\r\n     of ill-will or ill-feeling. He has done as regards this\r\n     country what the necessities of his situation demanded from\r\n     him, and he has done no more[1240].\"\r\n\r\nThis was to tread gently; but more exactly and more boldly the real\r\nreaction of the press was indicated by _Punch's_ cartoon of a phoenix,\r\nbearing the grim and forceful face of Lincoln, rising from the ashes\r\nwhere lay the embers of all that of old time had gone to make up the\r\n_liberties_ of America[1241].\r\n\r\nDuring the months immediately preceding Lincoln's re-election English\r\nfriends of the South had largely remained inactive. Constantly twitted\r\nthat at the chief stronghold of the _Southern Independence Association_,\r\nManchester, they did not dare to hold a meeting in the great Free Trade\r\nHall[1242], they tried ticket meetings in smaller halls, but even there\r\nmet with opposition from those who attended. At three other places,\r\nOldham, Ashton, and Stockport, efforts to break the Northern hold on the\r\nmanufacturing districts met with little success[1243], and even, as\r\nreported in the _Index_, were attended mainly by \"magistrates, clergy,\r\nleading local gentry, manufacturers, tradesmen, and cotton operatives,\"\r\nthe last named being also, evidently, the last considered, and\r\npresumably the least represented[1244]. The Rev. Mr. Massie conducted\r\n\"follow up\" Northern meetings wherever the Southern friends ventured an\r\nappearance[1245]. At one town only, Oldham, described by _The Index_ as\r\n\"the most 'Southern' town in Lancashire,\" was a meeting held at all\r\ncomparable with the great demonstrations easily staged by pro-Northern\r\nfriends. Set for October 31, great efforts were made to picture this\r\nmeeting as an outburst of indignation from the unemployed. Summoned by\r\nhandbills headed \"_The Crisis! The Crisis! The Crisis!_\" there\r\ngathered, according to _The Index_ correspondent, a meeting \"of between\r\n5,000 and 6,000 wretched paupers, many of whom were women with children\r\nin their arms, who, starved apparently in body and spirit as in raiment,\r\nhad met together to exchange miseries, and ask one another what was to\r\nbe done.\" Desperate speeches were made, the people \"almost threatening\r\nviolence,\" but finally adopting a resolution now become so hackneyed as\r\nto seem ridiculous after a description intended to portray the misery\r\nand the revolutionary character of the meeting:\r\n\r\n     \"That in consequence of the widespread distress that now\r\n     prevails in the cotton districts by the continuance of the\r\n     war in America, this meeting is desirous that Her Majesty's\r\n     Government should use their influence, together with France\r\n     and other European powers, to bring both belligerents\r\n     together in order to put a stop to the vast destruction of\r\n     life and property that is now going on in that unhappy\r\n     country[1246].\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt this spectacular meeting was organized for effect, but in truth\r\nit must have overshot the mark, for by October, 1864, the distress in\r\nLancashire was largely alleviated and the public knew it, while\r\nelsewhere in the cotton districts the mass of operative feeling was with\r\nthe North. Even in Ireland petitions were being circulated for signature\r\namong the working men, appealing to Irishmen in America to stand by the\r\nadministration of Lincoln and to enlist in the Northern armies on the\r\nground of emancipation[1247]. Here, indeed, was the insuperable barrier,\r\nin the fall of 1864, to public support of the South. Deny as he might\r\nthe presence of the \"foul blot\" in Southern society, Hotze, of _The\r\nIndex_, could not counteract that phrase. When the Confederate Congress\r\nat Richmond began, in the autumn of 1864, seriously to discuss a plan\r\nof transforming slaves into soldiers, putting guns in their hands, and\r\nthus replenishing the waning man-power of Southern armies, Hotze was\r\nhard put to it to explain to his English readers that this was in fact\r\nno evidence of lowered strength, but rather a noble determination on the\r\npart of the South to permit the negro to win his freedom by bearing arms\r\nin defence of his country[1248].\r\n\r\nThis was far-fetched for a journal that had long insisted upon the\r\nabsolute incapacity of the black race. Proximity of dates, however,\r\npermits another interpretation of Hotze's editorial of November 10, and\r\nindeed of the project of arming the slaves, though this, early in the\r\nspring of 1865, was actually provided for by law. On November 11,\r\nSlidell, Mason and Mann addressed to the Powers of Europe a\r\ncommunication accompanying a Confederate \"Manifesto,\" of which the\r\nblockade had long delayed transmissal. This \"Manifesto\" set forth the\r\nobjects of the Southern States and flatly demanded recognition:\r\n\r\n     \"'All they ask is immunity from interference with their\r\n     internal peace and prosperity and to be left in the\r\n     undisturbed enjoyment of their inalienable rights of life,\r\n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness which their common\r\n     ancestry declared to be the equal heritage of all parties to\r\n     the Social compact[1249].'\"\r\n\r\nRussell replied, November 25:\r\n\r\n     \"Great Britain has since 1783, remained, with the exception\r\n     of a short period, connected by friendly relations with both\r\n     the Northern and the Southern States. Since the commencement\r\n     of the Civil War which broke out in 1861, Her Majesty's\r\n     Government have continued to entertain sentiments of\r\n     friendship equally for the North and for the South; of the\r\n     causes of the rupture Her Majesty's Government have never\r\n     presumed to judge; they deplored the commencement of this\r\n     sanguinary struggle, and anxiously look forward to the period\r\n     of its termination. In the meantime they are convinced that\r\n     they best consult the interests of peace, and respect the\r\n     rights of all parties by observing a strict and impartial\r\n     Neutrality. Such a Neutrality Her Majesty has faithfully\r\n     maintained and will continue to maintain[1250].\"\r\n\r\nIf _The Index_ did indeed hope for results from the \"Manifesto,\" and had\r\nsought to bolster the appeal by dilating on a Southern plan to \"let the\r\nslaves win their freedom,\" the answer of Russell was disappointing. Yet\r\nat the moment, in spite of the effect of Lincoln's re-election, the\r\ncurrent of alleged expert military opinion was again swinging in favour\r\nof the South. The _Times_ scored Russell's answer, portraying him as\r\nattempting to pose as \"Our Mutual Friend\":\r\n\r\n     \"The difficulty, of course, was to be polite to the\r\n     representatives of the Confederate States without appearing\r\n     rude to the United States; and, on the other hand, to\r\n     acknowledge the authority of the United States without\r\n     affronting the dignity of the Confederates. Between these two\r\n     pitfalls Lord Russell oscillates in his letter, and now puts\r\n     his foot a little bit in the hole on one side, and then, in\r\n     recovering himself gets a little way into the hole on the\r\n     other side. In this way he sways to and fro for a minute or\r\n     two, but rights himself at last, and declares he has hitherto\r\n     stood upright between the two pitfalls, and he will continue\r\n     to do so.... Lord Russell seems to be in danger of forgetting\r\n     that _neuter_ does not mean _both_, but _neither_, and that\r\n     if, therefore, he would maintain even in words a strict\r\n     neutrality it is necessary to avoid any demonstrations of\r\n     friendship to either belligerent[1251].\"\r\n\r\nThis was harsh criticism, evincing a _Times_ partisanship justifying\r\nthe allegations of the _Gazette_, but wholly in line with the opinion to\r\nwhich the _Times_ was now desperately clinging that Grant had failed and\r\nthat Sherman, adventuring on his spectacular \"march to the sea\" from\r\nAtlanta, was courting annihilation. Yet even Northern friends were\r\nappalled at Sherman's boldness and discouraged by Grant's slowness. The\r\nson of the American Minister could write, \"Grant moves like the iron\r\nwall in Poe's story. You expect something tremendous, and it's only a\r\nstep after all[1252].\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ was at least consistent in prophecies until the event\r\nfalsified them; the _Gazette_ less so. Some six weeks after having\r\nacclaimed Sherman's generalship in the capture of Atlanta[1253], the\r\n_Gazette's_ summary of the military situation was that:\r\n\r\n     \"... if the winter sees Grant still before Petersburg, and\r\n     Sherman unable to hold what he has gained in Georgia, the\r\n     South may be nearer its dawning day of independence than\r\n     could have been expected a few weeks ago, even though\r\n     Wilmington be captured and Charleston be ground away\r\n     piecemeal under a distant cannonade. The position of the\r\n     Democrats would urge them to desperate measures, and the\r\n     wedge of discord will be driven into the ill-compacted body\r\n     which now represents the Federal States of North\r\n     America[1254].\"\r\n\r\nBut on December 17, W.H. Russell again changed his view and foretold\r\nwith accuracy Sherman's movements toward Savannah. Not so the _Times_,\r\nprivately very anxious as to what Sherman's campaign portended, while\r\npublicly belittling it. December 2, it was noted that Sherman had not\r\nbeen heard from for weeks, having left Atlanta with 50,000 men. December\r\n5, his objective was stated to be Savannah, and while the difficulties\r\nto be encountered were enumerated, no prophecy was indulged in. But on\r\nDecember 22, Sherman's move was called a \"desperate\" one, forced by his\r\ninability to retreat _northward_ from Atlanta:\r\n\r\n     \"If we turn to military affairs, we are informed that the\r\n     great feature of the year is Sherman's expedition into\r\n     Georgia. We are not yet able to say whether Sherman will\r\n     succeed in escaping the fate of Burgoyne; but we know that\r\n     his apparent rashness is excused by the fact that Sherman was\r\n     unable to return on the way by which he came; so that the\r\n     most remarkable feature of the war, according to the\r\n     President, is the wild and desperate effort of an\r\n     out-manoeuvred General to extricate himself from a position\r\n     which, whatever effect it may have had on the election,\r\n     should never, on mere military grounds, have been occupied at\r\n     all[1255].\"\r\n\r\nThis was followed up four days later by a long and careful review of\r\nSherman's whole western campaign, concluding with the dictum that his\r\nsole object now was to escape to some undefended point on the coast\r\nwhere he could be rescued by the Northern navy. The war had taken a\r\ndefinite turn in favour of the South; it was impossible to conceive that\r\nSherman would venture to attack Savannah:\r\n\r\n     \"For the escape or safety of Sherman and his army it is\r\n     essential he should reach Beaufort, or some neighbouring\r\n     point on the sea-coast as rapidly as possible. Delay would be\r\n     equivalent to ruin, and he will do nothing to create\r\n     it[1256].\"\r\n\r\nRarely, if ever, did the _Times_, in its now eager and avowed\r\nchampionship so definitely commit itself in an effort to preserve\r\nBritish confidence in the Southern cause[1257]. Even friends of the\r\nNorth were made doubtful by the positiveness of prediction indulged in\r\nby that journal whose opinions were supposed to be based on superior\r\ninformation. Their recourse was to a renewal of \"deputations\" calling on\r\nthe American Minister to express steady allegiance to the Northern\r\ncause[1258], and their relief was great when the news was received that\r\nSavannah had fallen, December 20, without a struggle. The _Times_\r\nrecorded the event, December 29, but with no comment save that Southern\r\nprospects were less rosy than had been supposed. Then ensued a long\r\nsilence, for this time there was no possibility of that editorial\r\nwiggling about the circle from excuses for misinterpretation to a\r\ncomplacent resumption of authoritative utterance.\r\n\r\nFor the editor, Delane, and for wise Southern sympathizers the fall of\r\nSavannah was a much harder blow than the mere loss of prestige to the\r\n_Times_[1259]. Courage failed and confidence in the South\r\nwaned--momentarily almost vanished. Nearly two weeks passed before the\r\n_Times_ ventured to lift again the banner of hope, and even then but\r\nhalf-heartedly.\r\n\r\n     \"The capture of the city completes the history of Sherman's\r\n     march, and stamps it as one of the ablest, certainly one of\r\n     the most singular military achievements of the war.\r\n\r\n     \"... The advantage gained for the Federal cause by the\r\n     possession of Savannah is yet to be shown. To Sherman and his\r\n     army 'the change of base' is indisputably a change for the\r\n     better. Assuming that his position at Atlanta was as\r\n     desperate as shortness of supplies and an interrupted line of\r\n     retreat could make it, the command of a point near the\r\n     sea-coast and free communication with the fleet is obviously\r\n     an improvement. At the least the army secures full means of\r\n     subsistence, and a point from which further operations may be\r\n     commenced. On the other hand, the blow, as far as the\r\n     Confederate Government is concerned, is mitigated by the fact\r\n     that Savannah has been little used as a seaport since the\r\n     capture of Fort Pulaski by the Federals at an early stage\r\n     of the war.\r\n\r\n     \"... But the fall of the city is a patent fact, and it would\r\n     be absurd to deny that it has produced an impression\r\n     unfavourable to the _prestige_ of the Confederacy[1260].\"\r\n\r\nFar more emphatic of ultimate Northern victory was the picture\r\npresented, though in sarcasm, by the _Times_ New York correspondent,\r\nprinted in this same issue:\r\n\r\n     \"No disappointments, however fast they may follow on the\r\n     heels of each other, can becloud the bright sunshine of\r\n     conceit and self-worship that glows in the heart of the\r\n     Yankee. His country is the first in the world, and he is the\r\n     first man in it. Knock him down, and he will get up again,\r\n     and brush the dirt from his knees, not a bit the worse for\r\n     the fall. If he do not win this time, he is bound to win the\r\n     next. His motto is 'Never say die.' His manifest destiny is\r\n     to go on--prospering and to prosper--conquering and to\r\n     conquer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1197: Dodd, _Jefferson Davis_, p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1198: See _ante_, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1199: Mason Papers.

Also on June 5, 1865,\r\nRussell wrote in his diary: \"...had the _Times_ followed my advice, how\r\ndifferent our position would be--not only that of the leading journal,\r\nbut of England. If ever I did State service, it was in my letters from\r\nAmerica.\" (Atkins, _Life of W.H. Russell_, Vol. II, p. 115.) See also\r\nBigelow, _Retrospections_, I, pp. 344-45. Russell was editor of the\r\n_Gazette_ on its first appearance as a weekly, January 6, 1860, but left\r\nit to go to America. On his return he settled down to his editorial task\r\nin November, 1862, and thereafter, throughout the war, the _Gazette_ may\r\nbe regarded as reflecting his views. His entire letters from America to\r\nthe _Times_ constitute a most valuable picture of the months preceding\r\nthe outbreak of war, but the contempt poured on the Northern army for\r\nits defeat at Bull Run made Russell much disliked in the North. This\r\ndislike was bitterly displayed in a pamphlet by Andrew D. White (\"A\r\nLetter to William Howard Russell, LL.D., on passages in his 'Diary North\r\nand South'\"), published in London in 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1219: June 25, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1220: The _Army and Navy Gazette_, July 30, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1221: _Ibid._, June 25, 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1222: _Ibid._, July 16, 1864. Similar articles and editorials\r\nmight be quoted from many of the more important papers, but the _Times_\r\nand the _Gazette_ will suffice as furnishing the keynote.

Readers of the _Constitutionel, Patrie,\r\nMoniteur_, and _La France_ \"know quite well that Sherman has neither\r\noccupied the centre, the circumference, nor, indeed, any part of the\r\ndefences of Atlanta; and that he was completely defeated by General Hood\r\non July 22.\" (_Index_, Aug. 18, 1864, p. 522.)

At this\r\n     moment opinion seems to have undergone a complete change, and\r\n     our people and indeed our Government is more moderately\r\n     disposed than I have ever before known it to be. I hear from\r\n     a member of the Government that it is believed that the\r\n     feeling between our Cabinet and the Washington Government has\r\n     been steadily improving[1261].\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote Bright to Sumner in the last week of January, 1865. Three\r\nweeks later he again wrote in reassurance against American rumours that\r\nEurope was still planning some form of intervention to save the South:\r\n\"_All parties and classes_ here are resolved on a strict\r\nneutrality[1262]....\" This was a correct estimate. In spite of a\r\ntemporary pause in the operations of Northern armies and of renewed\r\nassertions from the South that she \"would never submit,\" British opinion\r\nwas now very nearly unanimous that the end was near. This verdict was\r\nsoon justified by events. In January, 1865, Wilmington, North Carolina,\r\nwas at last captured by a combined sea and land attack. Grant, though\r\nsince midsummer, 1864, held in check by Lee before Petersburg, was yet\r\nknown to be constantly increasing the strength of his army, while his\r\nability to strike when the time came was made evident by the freedom\r\nwith which his cavalry scoured the country about the Confederate\r\ncapital, Richmond--in one raid even completely encircling that city.\r\nSteadily Lee's army lost strength by the attrition of the siege, by\r\nillness and, what was worse, by desertion since no forces could be\r\nspared from the fighting front to recover and punish the deserters.\r\nGrant waited for the approach of spring, when, with the advance\r\nnorthwards of the army at Savannah, the pincers could be applied to Lee,\r\nto end, it was hoped, in writing _finis_ to the war.\r\n\r\nFrom December 20, 1864, to February 1, 1865, Sherman remained in\r\nSavannah, renewing by sea the strength of his army. On the latter date\r\nhe moved north along the coast, meeting at first no resistance and\r\neasily overrunning the country. Columbia, capital of South Carolina, was\r\nburned. Charleston was evacuated, and it was not until March, in North\r\nCarolina, that any real opposition to the northward progress was\r\nencountered. Here on the sixteenth and the nineteenth, Johnston, in\r\ncommand of the weak Southern forces in North Carolina, made a desperate\r\neffort to stop Sherman, but without avail, and on March 23, Sherman was\r\nat Goldsboro, one hundred and sixty miles south of Richmond, prepared to\r\ncut off the retreat of Lee when Grant should at last take up an\r\nenergetic offensive.\r\n\r\nIn the last week of March, Grant began cutting off supplies to Richmond,\r\nthus forcing Lee, if he wished still to protect the Southern capital, to\r\ncome out of his lines at Petersburg and present an unfortified front.\r\nThe result was the evacuation of Petersburg and the abandonment of\r\nRichmond, Jefferson Davis and his Government fleeing from the city on\r\nthe night of April 2. Attempting to retreat southwards with the plan of\r\njoining Johnston's army, Lee, on April 9, found his forces surrounded at\r\nAppomattox and surrendered. Nine days later, on April 18, Johnston\r\nsurrendered to Sherman at Durham, North Carolina. It was the end of the\r\nwar and of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN GLADIATORS-HABET! _Reproduced by permission\r\nof the Proprietors of \"Punch\"_]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which Southern resistance in arms crumbled in 1865\r\nwhen once Sherman and Grant were under way no doubt startled foreign\r\nobservers, but in British opinion, at least, the end had been foreseen\r\nfrom the moment Sherman reached the sea at Savannah. The desperate\r\ncourage of the South was admired, but regarded as futile. Equally\r\ndesperate and futile was the last diplomatic effort of the Confederate\r\nagents in Europe, taking the form of an offer to abolish slavery in\r\nreturn for recognition. The plan originated with Benjamin, Southern\r\nSecretary of State, was hesitatingly approved by Davis[1263], and was\r\ncommitted to Mason for negotiation with Great Britain. Mason, after his\r\nwithdrawal from London, had been given duplicate powers in blank for any\r\npoint to which emergencies might send him, thus becoming a sort of\r\nConfederate Commissioner at Large to Europe. Less than any other\r\nrepresentative abroad inclined to admit that slavery was other than a\r\nbeneficent and humane institution, it was felt advisable at Richmond not\r\nonly to instruct Mason by written despatch, but by personal messenger\r\nalso of the urgency of presenting the offer of abolition promptly and\r\nwith full assurance of carrying it into effect. The instruction was\r\ntherefore entrusted to Duncan F. Kenner, of Louisiana, and he arrived in\r\nParis early in March, 1865, overcame Mason's unwillingness to carry such\r\nan offer to England, and accompanied the latter to London.\r\n\r\nThe time was certainly not propitious, for on the day Mason reached\r\nLondon there came the news of the burning of Columbia and the evacuation\r\nof Charleston. Mason hesitated to approach Palmerston, but was pressed\r\nby Kenner who urged action on the theory that Great Britain did not wish\r\nto see a reconstruction of the Union[1264]. Slidell, in Paris, on\r\nreceiving Mason's doubts, advised waiting until the Emperor had been\r\nconsulted, was granted an interview and reported Napoleon III as ready\r\nas ever to act if England would act also, but as advising delay until\r\nmore favourable news was received from America[1265]. But Mason's\r\ninstructions did not permit delay; he must either carry them out or\r\nresign--and Kenner was at his elbow pressing for action. On March 13,\r\ntherefore, Mason wrote to Palmerston asking for a private interview and\r\nwas promptly granted one for the day following.\r\n\r\nBoth personal disinclination to the proposal of abolition and judgment\r\nthat nothing would come of it made Mason cautious in expressing himself\r\nto Palmerston. Mason felt that he was stultifying his country in\r\ncondemning slavery. Hence in roundabout language, \"with such form of\r\nallusion to the _concession_ we held in reserve, as would make him\r\nnecessarily comprehend it[1266],\" and turning again and again to a\r\nsupposed \"latent, undisclosed obstacle[1267]\" to British recognition,\r\nMason yet made clear the object of his visit. The word slavery was not\r\nmentioned by him, but Palmerston promptly denied that slavery in the\r\nSouth had ever been, or was now, a barrier to recognition; British\r\nobjections to recognition were those which had long since been stated,\r\nand there was nothing \"underlying\" them. On March 26, Mason called on\r\nthe Earl of Donoughmore, a Tory friend of the South with whom he had\r\nlong been in close touch, and asked whether he thought Palmerston's\r\nGovernment could be induced by a Southern abolition of slavery to\r\nrecognize the Confederacy. The reply was \"that the time had gone by\r\nnow....\" This time the words \"slavery\" and \"abolition\" were spoken\r\nboldly[1268], and Donoughmore was positive that if, in the midsummer of\r\n1863, when Lee was invading Pennsylvania, the South had made its present\r\noverture, nothing could have prevented British recognition. The opinion\r\nclashed with Mason's own conviction, but in any case no more was to be\r\nhoped, now, from his overture. Only a favourable turn in the war could\r\nhelp the South.\r\n\r\nThere was no public knowledge in London of this \"last card\" Southern\r\neffort in diplomacy, though there were newspaper rumours that some such\r\nmove was on foot, but with a primary motive of restoring Southern\r\nfighting power by putting the negroes in arms. British public attention\r\nwas fixed rather upon a possible last-moment reconciliation of North and\r\nSouth and a restored Union which should forget its domestic troubles in\r\na foreign war. Momentarily somewhat of a panic overcame London society\r\nand gloomy were the forebodings that Great Britain would be the chosen\r\nenemy of America. Like rumours were afloat at Washington also. The\r\nRussian Minister, Stoeckl, reported to his Government that he had\r\nlearned from \"a sure source\" of representations made to Jefferson Davis\r\nby Blair, a prominent Unionist and politician of the border state of\r\nMaryland, looking to reconstruction and to the sending by Lincoln of\r\narmies into Canada and Mexico. Stoeckl believed such a war would be\r\npopular, but commented that \"Lincoln might change his mind[1269]\r\nto-morrow.\" In London the _Army and Navy Gazette_ declared that Davis\r\ncould not consent to reunion and that Lincoln could not offer any other\r\nterms of peace, but that a truce might be patched up on the basis of a\r\ncommon aggression against supposed foreign enemies[1270]. Adams pictured\r\nall British society as now convinced that the end of the war was near,\r\nand bitter against the previous tone and policy of such leaders of\r\npublic opinion as the _Times_, adding that it was being \"whispered about\r\nthat if the feud is reconciled and the Union restored, and a great army\r\nleft on our hands, the next manifestation will be one of hostility to\r\nthis country[1271].\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of all this rumour was Blair's attempt to play the mediator.\r\nHe so far succeeded that on January 31, 1865, Lincoln instructed Seward\r\nto go to Fortress Monroe to meet \"commissioners\" appointed by Davis. But\r\nLincoln made positive in his instructions three points:\r\n\r\n     (1) Complete restoration of the Union.\r\n\r\n     (2) No receding on emancipation.\r\n\r\n     (3) No cessation of hostilities \"short of an end of the war,\r\n     and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later the President decided that his own presence was\r\ndesirable and joined his Secretary of State in the \"Hampton Roads\r\nConference\" of February 3. It quickly appeared that the Confederates did\r\nindeed hope to draw the North into a foreign war for a \"traditional\r\nAmerican object,\" using the argument that _after_ such a war restoration\r\nof the Union would be easily accomplished. The enemy proposed was not\r\nGreat Britain but France, and the place of operations Mexico. There was\r\nmuch discussion of this plan between Seward and Stephens, the leading\r\nSouthern Commissioner, but Lincoln merely listened, and when pressed for\r\ncomment stuck fast to his decision that no agreement whatever would be\r\nentered into until the South had laid down its arms. The Southerners\r\nurged that there was precedent for an agreement in advance of cessation\r\nof hostilities in the negotiations between Charles I and the Roundheads.\r\nLincoln's reply was pithy: \"I do not profess to be posted in history. On\r\nall such matters I turn you over to Seward. All I distinctly recollect\r\nabout the case of Charles I is that he lost his head in the end[1272].\"\r\n\r\nWhen news of the holding of this conference reached England there\r\noccurred a panic on the Stock Exchange due to the uncertainty created by\r\nthe prospect of an immediate end of the American War. \"The\r\nconsternation,\" wrote Adams, \"was extraordinary[1273].\" What did the\r\nUnited States intend to do? \"The impression is now very general that\r\npeace and restoration at home are synonymous with war with this\r\ncountry.\" There existed an \"extraordinary uneasiness and indefinite\r\napprehension as to the future.\" So reported Adams to Seward; and he\r\nadvised that it might be well for the United States \"to consider the\r\nquestion how far its policy may be adapted to quiet this disturbance\";\r\ndue allowance should be made for the mortification of those leaders who\r\nhad been so confident of Southern victory and for expressions that might\r\nnow fall from their lips; it was possible that reassurances given by the\r\nUnited States might aid in the coming elections in retaining the\r\nGovernment in power--evidently, in Adams' opinion, a result to be\r\ndesired[1274].\r\n\r\nAdams' advice as to the forthcoming elections was but repetition of that\r\ngiven earlier and with more emphasis[1275]. Apparently Seward was then\r\nin no mood to act on it, for his reply was distinctly belligerent in\r\ntone, recapitulating British and Canadian offences in permitting the\r\nenemy to use their shores, and asserting that the measures now proposed\r\nof abrogating the reciprocity treaty of 1854 with Canada and the\r\nagreement of 1817 prohibiting armaments on the Great Lakes, were but\r\ndefensive measures required to protect American soil[1276]. These\r\nmatters Adams had been instructed to take up with Russell, but with\r\ndiscretion as to time and he had ventured to postpone them as\r\ninopportune. Professing entire agreement with the justice of Seward's\r\ncomplaints he nevertheless wrote that to press them \"at this moment\r\nwould be only playing into the hands of the mischief-makers, and\r\ndisarming our own friends[1277].\" The day before this was written home\r\nSeward, at Washington, on March 8, recalled his instruction as to the\r\nagreement of 1817, stating that Russell might be informed the United\r\nStates had no intention of increasing its armaments on the Great\r\nLakes[1278].\r\n\r\nThus there were incidents offering ground for a British excitement over\r\na prospective war with America, even though no such intention was\r\nseriously entertained by the North. The British Government did not share\r\nthis fear, but Delane, of the _Times_, kept it alive in the public mind,\r\nand indeed was sincere in efforts to arouse his readers to the danger.\r\n\"I do not know what grounds Delane has for it,\" wrote W.H. Russell to\r\nhis American friend Bigelow, \"but he is quite sure Uncle Samuel is about\r\nto finish off the dreadful Civil War with another war with us scarcely\r\nless horrible[1279].\" Governmental circles, however, belittled the\r\nagitation. Burnley, temporarily representing England at Washington, was\r\nassured by Seward, and so reported, that all these rumours of a foreign\r\nwar were of Southern origin, had in fact been actually elaborated at the\r\nHampton Roads Conference, but were perfectly understood by the North as\r\nbut part of the Southern game, and that the Southern offer had been\r\nflatly refused[1280]. In a parliamentary debate in the Commons on March\r\n13, arising out of governmental estimates for military expenditures in\r\nCanada, opportunity was given for a discussion of relations with\r\nAmerica. A few Members gave voice to the fear of war, but the general\r\ntone of the debate was one of confidence in the continuance of peaceful\r\nrelations. Bright, in a vigorous and witty speech, threw right and left\r\ncriticisms of Parliament, the Press, and individuals, not sparing\r\nmembers of the Government, but expressed the utmost confidence in the\r\npacific policy of Lincoln. As one known to be in close touch with\r\nAmerica his words carried weight[1281]. Palmerston gave assurances that\r\nthe present relations between the two Governments were perfectly\r\nfriendly and satisfactory. The effect of the debate, reported Adams, was\r\nto quiet the panic[1282], yet at the same time England was now awake to\r\nand somewhat alarmed by, America's \"prodigious development of physical\r\npower during the war.\" To quiet this, Adams recommended \"prudence and\r\nmoderation in tone[1283].\"\r\n\r\nThus the actual cessation of hostilities in America and the possible\r\neffect of this event on foreign relations had been for some time\r\nanticipated and estimated in Great Britain[1284]. The news of Lee's\r\nsurrender, therefore, caused no great surprise since the _Times_ and\r\nother papers had been preparing the public for it[1285]. Newspaper\r\ncomment on the event followed closely that of the _Times_, rendering\r\nhonour to the militant qualities of the South and to Lee, but writing\r\n_finis_ to the war:\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the end of the great army which, organized by the\r\n     extraordinary genius of one man, aided by several other\r\n     commanders of eminent ability, has done such wonders in this\r\n     war. Not even the Grand Army of Napoleon himself could count\r\n     a series of more brilliant victories than the force which,\r\n     raised chiefly from the high-spirited population of Virginia,\r\n     has defeated so many invasions of the State, and crushed the\r\n     hopes of so many Northern generals. Chief and soldiers have\r\n     now failed for the first and last time. They were victorious\r\n     until victory was no longer to be achieved by human valour,\r\n     and then they fell with honour[1286].\"\r\n\r\nThe people of the North, also, were complimented for their slowly\r\ndeveloped but ultimate ability in war, and especially for \"a patience, a\r\nfortitude, and an energy which entitle them to rank among the very first\r\nof military nations[1287].\" No one remained to uphold the Southern\r\nbanner in Europe save the Confederate agents, and, privately, even they\r\nwere hopeless. Mason, it is true, asserted, as if bolstering his own\r\ncourage, that \"this morning's\" news did not mean an overwhelming\r\ndisaster; it could not be wholly true; even if true it must mean peace\r\non the basis of separation; finally, \"5th. _I know_ that no terms of\r\npeace would be accepted that did not embrace independence.\" But at the\r\nconclusion of this letter he acknowledged:\r\n\r\n     \"I confess that all this speculation rests on, what I assume,\r\n     that Lee surrendered only in expectation of a peace derived\r\n     from his interview with Grant--and that no terms of peace\r\n     would be entertained that did not rest on\r\n     _independence_[1288].\"\r\n\r\nBut Slidell saw more clearly. He replied:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot share your hopefulness. We have seen the beginning\r\n     of the end. I, for my part, am prepared for the worst. With\r\n     Lee's surrender there will soon be an end to our regular\r\n     organized armies and I can see no possible good to result\r\n     from a protracted guerilla warfare. We are crushed and must\r\n     submit to the yoke. Our children must bide their time for\r\n     vengeance, but you and I will never revisit our homes under\r\n     our glorious flag. For myself I shall never put my foot on a\r\n     soil from which flaunts the hated Stars and Stripes.... I am\r\n     sick, sick at heart[1289].\"\r\n\r\nThe news of Lee's surrender arrived at the same moment with that of a\r\nserious injury to Seward in a runaway accident, and in its editorial on\r\nthe end of the war the _Times_ took occasion to pay a tribute to the\r\nstatesman whom it had been accustomed to berate.\r\n\r\n     \"There seems to be on the part of President Lincoln a desire\r\n     to conciliate vanquished fellow-citizens. Under the guidance\r\n     of Mr. Seward, who has creditably distinguished himself in\r\n     the Cabinet by his moderate counsels, and whose life will, we\r\n     trust, be spared at this crisis to the Union, he may by\r\n     gentle measures restore tranquillity, and perhaps, before his\r\n     term of office expires, calm in some degree the animosities\r\n     which have been raised by these years of war[1290].\"\r\n\r\nNor was this insincere, for Seward had, first in the estimate of British\r\nstatesmen, more slowly in the press and with the public, come to be\r\nregarded in an aspect far different from that with which he was\r\ngenerally viewed in 1861. There was real anxiety at the reports of\r\nSeward's accident, but when, in less than a week, there was received\r\nalso the news of the assassination of Lincoln and of the brutal attack\r\non Seward, all England united in expressions of sympathy and horror.\r\n\"Few events of the present century,\" wrote Adams, \"have created such\r\ngeneral consternation and indignation[1291].\"\r\n\r\nIn Ford's Theatre on the evening of April 14, Lincoln was shot by Booth,\r\na fanatical Southerner, who had gained entrance to the box where the\r\nPresident was sitting. Lincoln died early the next morning. On the same\r\nevening, at about ten o'clock, an unknown man was admitted to Seward's\r\nhouse on the plea that he had a message from the physician, passed\r\nupstairs, but was stopped by Seward's son at the door of the sick room.\r\nBeating the son into semi-unconsciousness with a revolver which had\r\nmissed fire, the stranger burst open the door, attacked the Secretary as\r\nhe lay in bed with a bowie-knife, slashing at his throat, until Seward\r\nrolled off the bed to the floor. Seward's throat was \"cut on both sides,\r\nhis right cheek nearly severed from his face\"; his life was saved,\r\nprobably, because of an iron frame worn to support the jaw fractured in\r\nthe runaway accident nine days before[1292]. The assailant fought his\r\nway out of the house and escaped. For some days Seward's life was\r\ndespaired of, whether from his injuries or from shock.\r\n\r\nThese tragic occurrences were the outcome of a revengeful spirit in the\r\nhearts of a few extreme Southerners, and in no sense represented the\r\nfeeling of the South. It was inevitable, however, that abroad so\r\nhorrible a crime should react both to the detriment of the Confederacy\r\nand to the advantage of the North. Sympathy with the North took the form\r\nof a sudden exaltation of the personality of Lincoln, bringing out\r\ncharacterizations of the man far different from those which had been his\r\nearlier in the war. The presence of a \"rural attorney\" in the\r\nPresidential office had seemed like the irony of fate in the great\r\ncrisis of 1861. Even so acute an observer as Lyons could then write,\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln has not hitherto given proof of his possessing any natural\r\ntalents to compensate for his ignorance of everything but Illinois\r\nvillage politics. He seems to be well meaning and conscientious, in the\r\nmeasure of his understanding, but not much more[1293].\" But Lyons was no\r\nmore blind than his contemporaries, for nearly all characterizations,\r\nwhether American or foreign, were of like nature.\r\n\r\nBut the slow progress of the years of war had brought a different\r\nestimate of Lincoln--a curious blending of admiration for the growth of\r\nhis personal authority and for his steadiness of purpose, with criticism\r\nof his alleged despotism. Now, with his death, following so closely the\r\ncollapse of the Confederacy, there poured out from British press and\r\npublic a great stream of laudation for Lincoln almost amounting to a\r\nnational recantation. In this process of \"whitening Abraham's tomb,\" as\r\na few dyed-in-the-wool Southern sympathizers called it, _Punch_ led the\r\nway in a poem by Tom Taylor:\r\n\r\n     \"_You_ lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier,\r\n     _You_, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,\r\n     Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,\r\n     His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,\r\n     To lame my pencil and confute my pen--\r\n     To make me own this hind of princes peer,\r\n     This rail-splitter a true-born king of men[1294].\"\r\n\r\nLess emotional than most papers, but with a truer estimate of Lincoln,\r\nstood the _Times_. Severely reprobating the act of Booth and prophesying\r\na disastrous effect in the treatment of the conquered South, it\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n     \"Starting from a humble position to one of the greatest\r\n     eminence, and adopted by the Republican party as a\r\n     make-shift, simply because Mr. Seward and their other\r\n     prominent leaders were obnoxious to different sections of\r\n     the party, it was natural that his career should be watched\r\n     with jealous suspicion. The office cast upon him was great,\r\n     its duties most onerous, and the obscurity of his past career\r\n     afforded no guarantee of his ability to discharge them. His\r\n     shortcomings moreover were on the surface. The education of a\r\n     man whose early years had been spent in earning bread by\r\n     manual labour had necessarily been defective, and faults of\r\n     manner and errors of taste repelled the observer at the\r\n     outset. In spite of these drawbacks, Mr. Lincoln slowly won\r\n     for himself the respect and confidence of all. His perfect\r\n     honesty speedily became apparent, and, what is, perhaps, more\r\n     to his credit, amid the many unstudied speeches which he was\r\n     called upon from time to time to deliver, imbued though they\r\n     were with the rough humour of his early associates, he was in\r\n     none of them betrayed into any intemperance of language\r\n     towards his opponents or towards neutrals. His utterances\r\n     were apparently careless, but his tongue was always under\r\n     command. The quality of Mr. Lincoln's administration which\r\n     served, however, more than any other to enlist the sympathy\r\n     of bystanders was its conservative progress. He felt his way\r\n     gradually to his conclusions, and those who will compare the\r\n     different stages of his career one with another will find\r\n     that his mind was growing throughout the course of it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The gradual change of his language and of his policy was\r\n     most remarkable. Englishmen learnt to respect a man who\r\n     showed the best characteristics of their race in his respect\r\n     for what is good in the past, acting in unison with a\r\n     recognition of what was made necessary by the events of\r\n     passing history[1295].\"\r\n\r\nThis was first reaction. Two days later, commenting on the far warmer\r\nexpressions of horror and sympathy emanating from all England, there\r\nappeared another and longer editorial:\r\n\r\n     \"If anything could mitigate the distress of the American\r\n     people in their present affliction, it might surely be the\r\n     sympathy which is expressed by the people of this country. We\r\n     are not using the language of hyperbole in describing the\r\n     manifestation of feeling as unexampled. Nothing like it has\r\n     been witnessed in our generation.... But President Lincoln\r\n     was only the chief of a foreign State, and of a State with\r\n     which we were not infrequently in diplomatic or political\r\n     collision. He might have been regarded as not much more to us\r\n     than the head of any friendly Government, and yet his end has\r\n     already stirred the feelings of the public to their\r\n     uttermost depths.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"... a space of twenty-four hours has sufficed not only to\r\n     fill the country with grief and indignation, but to evoke\r\n     almost unprecedented expressions of feeling from constituted\r\n     bodies. It was but on Wednesday that the intelligence of the\r\n     murder reached us, and on Thursday the Houses of Lords and\r\n     Commons, the Corporation of the City of London, and the\r\n     people of our chief manufacturing towns in public meeting\r\n     assembled had recorded their sentiments or expressed their\r\n     views. In the House of Lords the absence of precedent for\r\n     such a manifestation was actually made the subject of remark.\r\n\r\n     \"That much of this extraordinary feeling is due to the\r\n     tragical character of the event and the horror with which the\r\n     crime is regarded is doubtless true, nor need we dissemble\r\n     the the fact that the loss which the Americans have sustained\r\n     is also thought our own loss in so far as one valuable\r\n     guarantee for the amity of the two nations may have been thus\r\n     removed. But, upon the whole, it is neither the possible\r\n     embarrassment of international relations nor the infamous\r\n     wickedness of the act itself which has determined public\r\n     feeling. The preponderating sentiment is sincere and genuine\r\n     sympathy--- sorrow for the chief of a great people struck\r\n     down by an assassin, and sympathy for that people in the\r\n     trouble which at a crisis of their destinies such a\r\n     catastrophe must bring. Abraham Lincoln was as little of a\r\n     tyrant as any man who ever lived. He could have been a tyrant\r\n     had he pleased, but he never uttered so much as an\r\n     ill-natured speech.... In all America there was, perhaps, not\r\n     one man who less deserved to be the victim of this revolution\r\n     than he who has just fallen[1296].\"\r\n\r\nThe Ministry did not wait for public pressure. Immediately on receipt\r\nof the news, motions were made, April 27, in both Lords and Commons for\r\nan address to the Queen, to be debated \"Monday next,\" expressing \"sorrow\r\nand indignation\" at the assassination of Lincoln[1297]. April 28,\r\nRussell instructed Bruce to express at Washington that \"the Government,\r\nthe Parliament, and the Nation are affected by a unanimous feeling of\r\nabhorrence of the criminals guilty of these cowardly and atrocious\r\ncrimes, and sympathy for the Government and People of the United\r\nStates[1298]....\" Russell wrote here of both Lincoln and Seward. The\r\nQueen wrote a personal letter of sympathy to Mrs. Lincoln. Already Bruce\r\nhad written from Washington that Lincoln \"was the only friend of the\r\nSouth in his party[1299],\" and he was extremely anxious that Seward's\r\nrecovery might be hastened, fearing the possibility of Sumner's\r\nassumption of the Secretaryship of State. \"We miss terribly the\r\ncomparative moderation of Lincoln and Seward[1300].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA SYMPATHISES WITH COLUMBIA. _Reproduced by\r\npermission of the Proprietors of \"Punch\"_]\r\n\r\nThe American Minister naturally became the centre toward which the\r\npublic outpouring of sympathy was directed. \"The excitement in this\r\ncountry has been deep and wide, spreading through all classes of\r\nsociety. My table is piled high with cards, letters and\r\nresolutions[1301]....\" Indeed all the old sources of \"addresses\" to\r\nAdams on emancipation and many organizations having no professed\r\ninterest in that subject now sent to him resolutions--the emancipation\r\nsocieties, of horror, indignation, and even accusation against the\r\nSouth; the others of sympathy, more moderate in tone, yet all\r\nevincing an appreciation of the great qualities of Lincoln and of the\r\njustice of the cause of the North, now victorious. Within two weeks\r\nAdams reported over four hundred such addresses from Emancipation\r\nSocieties, Chambers of Commerce, Trades Unions, municipalities,\r\nboroughs, churches, indeed from every known type of British\r\norganizations[1302].\r\n\r\nOn May 1 the motion for the address to the Crown came up for debate. In\r\nthe Lords, Russell emphasized the kindly and forgiving qualities of\r\nLincoln as just those needed in America, and now lost by his death.\r\nDerby, for the Opposition, expressed the horror of the world at Booth's\r\nact, joined in expressions of sympathy to the United States, but\r\nrepeated the old phrase about the \"North fighting for empire, the South\r\nfor independence,\" and hinted that the unusual step now being taken by\r\nParliament had in it a \"political object,\" meaning that the motion had\r\nbeen introduced in the hope of easing American irritation with Great\r\nBritain[1303]. It was not a tactful speech, but Derby's lieutenant in\r\nthe Commons, Disraeli, saved his party from criticism by what was\r\ndistinctly the most thoughtful and best-prepared utterance of the day.\r\nPalmerston was ill. The Government speech was made by Grey, who\r\nincautiously began by asserting that the majority of the people of Great\r\nBritain had always been on the side of the North and was met by cries of\r\n\"No, no\" and \"Hear, hear.\" Disraeli concluded the debate. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"There are rare instances when the sympathy of a nation\r\n     approaches those tenderer feelings that generally speaking,\r\n     are supposed to be peculiar to the individual, and to form\r\n     the happy privilege of private life; and this is one. Under\r\n     all circumstances we should have bewailed the catastrophe at\r\n     Washington; under all circumstances we should have shuddered\r\n     at the means by which it was accomplished. But in the\r\n     character of the victim, and even in the accessories of his\r\n     last moments there is something so homely and so innocent\r\n     that it takes as it were the subject out of all the pomp of\r\n     history and the ceremonial of diplomacy; it touches the heart\r\n     of nations, and appeals to the domestic sentiment of mankind.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, whatever the various and varying opinions in this\r\n     House, and in the country generally on the policy of the late\r\n     President of the United States, on this, I think, all must\r\n     agree, that in one of the severest trials which ever tested\r\n     the moral qualities of man, he fulfilled his duty with\r\n     simplicity and strength. Nor is it possible for the people of\r\n     England, at such a moment, to forget that he sprang from the\r\n     same fatherland, and spoke the same mother tongue.\r\n\r\n     \"When such crimes are perpetrated the public mind is apt to\r\n     fall into gloom and perplexity; for it is ignorant alike of\r\n     the causes and the consequences of such deeds. But it is one\r\n     of our duties to reassure the country under unreasoning panic\r\n     or despondency. Assassination has never changed the history\r\n     of the world....\r\n\r\n     \"In expressing our unaffected and profound sympathy with the\r\n     citizens of the United States at the untimely end of their\r\n     elected Chief, let us not, therefore, sanction any feeling of\r\n     depression, but rather let us express a fervent hope that\r\n     from out the awful trials of the last four years, of which\r\n     not the least is this violent demise, the various populations\r\n     of North America may issue elevated and chastened; rich in\r\n     that accumulated wisdom, and strong in that disciplined\r\n     energy which a young nation can only acquire in a protracted\r\n     and perilous struggle. Then they will be enabled not merely\r\n     to renew their career of power and prosperity, but they will\r\n     renew it to contribute to the general happiness of mankind.\r\n     It is with these feelings, Sir, that I second the Address to\r\n     the Crown[1304].\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's assassination served to bring out not only British popular\r\nsympathy, but also the certitude that the war was over and the North\r\nvictorious. But officially the Government had not yet recognized this.\r\nEven as early as January, 1865, Seward had returned to the old proposal\r\nthat the nations of Europe should withdraw their recognition of\r\nSouthern belligerent rights[1305], and in March he had asked Stoeckl,\r\nthe Russian Minister, whether Russia would not lead in the suggestion of\r\nthis measure to England and France[1306]. Meanwhile Sherman's army was\r\nrapidly advancing northward and reports were arriving of its pillagings\r\nand burnings. March 20, Gregory asked in the Commons whether the\r\nGovernment was taking any steps to prevent the destruction of British\r\nproperty and received from Layard an evasive reply. Merely a \"confident\r\nhope\" had been expressed to the United States that \"every facility will\r\nbe given\" to British subjects to prove ownership of property[1307].\r\nEvidently the Government was not eager to raise irritating questions at\r\na moment when all eyes were strained to observe the concluding events\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nThen came the news of Lee's surrender and of the assassination of\r\nLincoln, with the attack on Seward, already incapacitated from active\r\nduties. Seward's illness delayed American pressure on England--a\r\nfortunate circumstance in the relations with Great Britain in that it\r\ngave time for a clearer appreciation of the rapidity and completeness of\r\nthe collapse of the South. May 15, Lord Houghton asked whether the\r\nGovernment did not intend, in view of recent events in America, \"to\r\nwithdraw the admission of belligerent rights conceded to the so-called\r\nConfederate States.\" Russell promptly objected to the form of the\r\nquestion: England had not \"conceded\" any rights to the South--she had\r\nmerely issued a proclamation of neutrality after Lincoln had declared\r\nthe existence of a war by proclaiming a blockade. England had had no\r\nother recourse, unless she chose to refuse recognition of the blockade,\r\nand this would have drawn her into the war. As to a withdrawal of the\r\nneutrality proclamation this must wait upon official announcement from\r\nthe United States that the war was at an end. Texas was still in arms\r\nand Galveston still blockaded, and for this section the United States\r\nwould no doubt continue to exercise on neutral vessels a belligerent\r\nright of search. It followed that if Great Britain did prematurely\r\nwithdraw her proclamation of neutrality and the United States searched a\r\nBritish vessel, it would be the exercise of a right of search in time of\r\npeace--an act against which Great Britain would be bound to make\r\nvigorous protest. Hence England must wait on American action proclaiming\r\nthe end of the war. Russell concluded by expressing gratification at the\r\nprospect of peace[1308].\r\n\r\nBut matters were not to take this orderly and logical course. Seward,\r\nthough still extremely weak and confined to his home, was eager to\r\nresume the duties of office, and on May 9 a Cabinet was held at his\r\nhouse. A week later Bruce wrote to Russell in some anxiety that America\r\nwas about to _demand_ the withdrawal by Great Britain of belligerent\r\nrights to the South, that if Great Britain would but act before such a\r\ndemand was made it would serve to continue the existing good feeling in\r\nAmerica created by the sympathy over Lincoln's death, and especially,\r\nthat there was a decided danger to good relations in the fact that\r\nConfederate cruisers were still at large. He urged that orders should be\r\nsent to stop their presence in British colonial ports securing coal and\r\nsupplies[1309]. Three days later Bruce repeated his warning[1310]. This\r\nwas, apparently, a complication unforeseen at the Foreign Office. In any\r\ncase Russell at once made a complete face-about from the policy he had\r\noutlined in reply to Lord Houghton. On May 30 he instructed Cowley in\r\nParis to notify France that England thought the time had arrived for\r\nrecognition that the war was ended and laid special stress upon the\r\nquestion of Confederate cruisers still at sea and their proper treatment\r\nin British ports[1311]. Thus having given to France notice of his\r\nintention, but without waiting for concurrent action, Russell, on June\r\n2, issued instructions to the Admiralty that the war was ended and\r\nstated the lines upon which the Confederate cruisers were to be\r\ntreated[1312]. Here was prompt, even hurried, action though the only\r\nadditional event of war in America which Russell could at the moment\r\ncite to warrant his change of policy was the capture of Jefferson Davis.\r\nOn the same day Russell wrote to Bruce stating what had been done and\r\nrecognizing the \"re-establishment of peace within the whole territory of\r\nwhich the United States, before the commencement of the civil war, were\r\nin undisturbed possession[1313].\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden shift by the Government did not escape Derby's caustic\r\ncriticism. June 12, he referred in Parliament to Houghton's previous\r\ninquiry and Russell's answer, asking why the Government had not stuck to\r\nits earlier position and calling attention to the fact that the United\r\nStates, while now proclaiming certain ports open to trade, yet specified\r\nothers as still closed and threatened with punishment as pirates, any\r\nvessel attempting to enter them. Derby desired information as to what\r\nthe Government had done about this remarkable American proclamation.\r\nRussell, \"who was very imperfectly heard,\" answered that undoubtedly it\r\nwas embarrassing that no \"regular communication\" had been received from\r\nAmerica giving notice of the end of the war, but that the two\r\nConfederate cruisers still at sea and the entrance of one of them to\r\nvarious Australian ports had compelled some British action. He had\r\nconsulted Adams, who had no instructions but felt confident the United\r\nStates would soon formally declare the end of the war. The \"piracy\r\nproclamation\" was certainly a strange proceeding. Derby pushed for an\r\nanswer as to whether the Government intended to let it go by unnoticed.\r\nRussell replied that a despatch from Bruce showed that \"notice\" had been\r\ntaken of it. Derby asked whether the papers would be presented to\r\nParliament; Russell \"was understood to reply in the affirmative[1314].\"\r\nDerby's inquiry was plainly merely a hectoring of Russell for his quick\r\nshift from the position taken a month earlier. But the very indifference\r\nof Russell to this attack, his carelessness and evasion in reply,\r\nindicate confidence that Parliament was as eager as the Government to\r\nsatisfy the North and to avoid friction. The only actual \"notice\" taken\r\nby Bruce at Washington of the \"piracy proclamation\" was in fact, to\r\nreport it to Russell, commenting that it was \"unintelligible\" and\r\nprobably a mere attempt to frighten foreign ship-owners[1315]. Russell\r\ninstructed Bruce not to ask for an explanation since Galveston had been\r\ncaptured subsequent to the date of the proclamation and there was\r\npresumably no port left where it could be applied[1316].\r\n\r\nIn truth the actual events of the closing days of the war had outrun\r\ndiplomatic action by America. Scattered Southern forces still in the\r\nfield surrendered with an unexpected rapidity, while at Washington all\r\nwas temporarily in confusion upon the death of Lincoln and the illness\r\nof Seward. Bruce's advice had been wise and the prompt action of Russell\r\nfortunate. Seward at once accepted Russell's notification of June 2 as\r\nending British neutrality. While again insisting upon the essential\r\ninjustice of the original concession of belligerent rights to the South,\r\nand objecting to some details in the instructions to the Admiralty, he\r\nyet admitted that normal relations were again established and\r\nacknowledged that the United States could no longer exercise a right of\r\nsearch[1317]. July 4, Russell presented this paper to Parliament,\r\nreading that portion in which Seward expressed his pleasure that the\r\nUnited States could now enter again upon normal relations with Great\r\nBritain[1318]. Two days later Russell wrote to Bruce that he had not\r\nexpected Seward to acknowledge the rightfulness of England's neutrality\r\nposition, pointed out that his Admiralty instructions were misunderstood\r\nand were less objectionable than appeared and concluded by the\r\nexpression of a hope for the \"establishment of a lasting and intimate\r\nfriendship between the two nations[1319].\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, wrote the Russian Minister in Washington in January,\r\n1860, was about to experience one of those \"strokes of fortune\" which\r\noccurred but rarely in the history of nations, in the approaching\r\ndissolution of the American Union. She alone, of all the nations of the\r\nworld, would benefit by it in the expansion of her power, hitherto\r\nblocked by the might of the United States. Broken into two or more\r\nhostile pieces America would be at the mercy of England, to become her\r\nplaything. \"The Cabinet of London is watching attentively the internal\r\ndissensions of the Union and awaits the result with an impatience which\r\nit has difficulty in disguising.\" Great Britain would soon, in return\r\nfor cotton, give recognition to the South and, if required, armed\r\nsupport. For this same cotton she would oppose emancipation of the\r\nslaves. The break-up of the Union was no less than a disaster for all\r\nnations save England, since hitherto the \"struggle\" between England and\r\nthe United States \"has been the best guarantee against the ambitious\r\nprojects and political egotism of the Anglo-Saxon race[1320].\"\r\n\r\nThis prophecy, made over a year in advance of events, was repeated\r\nfrequently as the crisis in America approached and during the first two\r\nyears of the war. Stoeckl was not solitary in such opinion. The French\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs held it also--and the French Emperor puzzled\r\nhimself in vain to discover why Great Britain, in furtherance of her own\r\ninterests, did not eagerly accept his overtures for a vigorous joint\r\naction in support of the South[1321].\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapters of this work will have shown how unfounded was\r\nsuch prophecy. Stoeckl was behind the times, knowing nothing,\r\napparently, of that positive change in British policy in the late\r\n'fifties which resulted in a determination to cease opposition to the\r\nexpansion of American power. Such opposition was then acknowledged to\r\nhave been an error and in its place there sprang into being a conviction\r\nthat the might of America would tend toward the greatness of England\r\nitself[1322]. In the months preceding the outbreak of the Civil War all\r\nBritish governmental effort was directed toward keeping clear of the\r\nquarrel and toward conciliation of the two sections. No doubt there were\r\nthose in Great Britain who rejoiced at the rupture between North and\r\nSouth, but they were not in office and had no control of British policy.\r\n\r\nThe war once begun, the Government, anxious to keep clear of it, was\r\nprompt in proclaiming neutrality and hastened this step for fear of\r\nmaritime complications with that one of the belligerents, the North,\r\nwhich alone possessed a naval force. But the British Ministry, like that\r\nof every other European state, believed that a revolution for\r\nindependence when undertaken by a people so numerous and powerful as\r\nthat of the South, must ultimately succeed. Hence as the war dragged on,\r\nthe Ministry, pressed from various angles at home, ventured, with much\r\nuncertainty, upon a movement looking toward mediation. Its desire was\r\nfirst of all for the restoration of world peace, nor can any other\r\nmotive be discovered in Russell's manoeuvres. This attempt, fortunately\r\nfor America and, it may be believed, for the world, was blocked by cool\r\nheads within the Ministry itself. There was quick and, as it proved,\r\npermanent readjustment of policy to the earlier decision not to meddle\r\nin the American crisis.\r\n\r\nThis very failure to meddle was cause of great complaint by both North\r\nand South, each expectant, from divergent reasons, of British sympathy\r\nand aid. The very anger of the North at British \"cold neutrality\" is\r\nevidence of how little America, feeling the ties of race and sentiment,\r\ncould have understood the mistaken view-point of diplomats like Stoeckl,\r\nwho dwelt in realms of \"reasons of state,\" unaffected by popular\r\nemotions. Aside from race, which could be claimed also by the South, the\r\none great argument of the North in appeal to England lay in the cry of\r\nanti-slavery. But the leaders of the North denied its pertinence. Itself\r\nunsympathetic with the emotions of emancipation societies at home, the\r\nBritish Government settled down by the end of 1862 to a fixed policy of\r\nstrict neutrality.\r\n\r\nIn all this the Government but pursued that line which is the business\r\nof Governments--the preservation of the prosperity and power of the\r\nstate. With the unexpected prolongation of the war and the British\r\nrecognition of the Northern \"will to conquer\" there came, as is evident\r\nfrom a scrutiny of Russell's diplomatic tone and acts, a growing belief\r\nthat the North might after all succeed in its purpose, at least of\r\nsubjugating the South. This would mean the possibility of continuing\r\nthat policy of friendship for a united America which had been determined\r\nupon in the 'fifties. Here was no special sympathy, but merely a cool\r\ncalculation of benefits to Great Britain, but there can be no question\r\nthat the general attitude of the Government by midsummer of 1863 was\r\ndistinctly favourable to a restored Union. A \"friendly neutrality\" began\r\nto replace a \"cold neutrality.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is the business of Governments not merely to guard national\r\ninterests and prosperity; they also must guard their own authority and\r\nseek to remain in political power. Here emancipation, never greatly\r\nstirring the leaders, whether Whig or Tory, exercised an increasing\r\npressure by the force of public approval. It made impossible any attempt\r\nto overthrow the Ministry on the score of non-interference in America,\r\nor of favouritism toward the North. It gave to an enthusiastic and\r\nvociferous section of the British public just ground for strong support\r\nof Lincoln and his cause, and in some degree it affected\r\ngovernmental attitude.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another question, much more vital than emancipation\r\nin its relation to British home politics, that ran like a constant\r\nthread through the whole pattern of British public attitude toward\r\nAmerica. It had always been so since the days of the American revolution\r\nand now was accentuated by the American war. This was the question of\r\nthe future of democracy. Was its fate bound up with the result of that\r\nwar? And if so where lay British interest? Always present in the minds\r\nof thoughtful Englishmen, appearing again and again through each\r\nchanging phase of the war, this question was so much a constant that to\r\nhave attempted discussion of it while other topics were being treated,\r\nwould have resulted in repetition and confusion. It is therefore made\r\nthe subject of a separate and concluding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1261: Bright to Sumner, Jan. 26, 1865 (Mass. Hist.

On that same day there occurred in the Commons the first\r\nserious debate in thirty-three years on a proposed expansion of the\r\nelectoral franchise. It was a dramatic coincidence and no mere\r\nfortuitous one in the minds of thoughtful Englishmen who had seen in the\r\nCivil War a struggle as fateful in British domestic policy as in that of\r\nAmerica herself. Throughout all British political agitation from the\r\ntime of the American revolution in 1776, there had run the thread of the\r\nAmerican \"example\" as argument to some for imitation, to others for\r\nwarning. Nearly every British traveller in America, publishing his\r\nimpressions, felt compelled to report on American governmental and\r\npolitical institutions, and did so from his preconceived notions of what\r\nwas desirable in his own country[1323]. In the ten years immediately\r\npreceding the Civil War most travellers were laudatory of American\r\ndemocracy, and one, the best in acute analysis up to the time of Lord\r\nBryce's great work, had much influence on that class in England which\r\nwas discontented with existing political institutions at home. This was\r\nMackay's _Western World_ which, first published in 1849, had gone\r\nthrough four editions in 1850 and in succeeding years was frequently\r\nreprinted[1324]. Republicanism, Mackay asserted, was no longer an\r\nexperiment; its success and permanence were evident in the mighty power\r\nof the United States; Canada would soon follow the American example; the\r\n\"injustice\" of British aristocrats to the United States was intentional,\r\nseeking to discredit democracy:\r\n\r\n     \"... Englishmen are too prone to mingle severity with their\r\n     judgments whenever the Republic is concerned. It is the\r\n     interest of aristocracy to exhibit republicanism, where-ever\r\n     it is found, in the worst possible light, and the mass of the\r\n     people have too long, by pandering to their prejudice, aided\r\n     them in their object. They recognize America as the\r\n     stronghold of republicanism. If they can bring it into\r\n     disrepute here, they know that they inflict upon it the\r\n     deadliest blow in Europe[1325].\"\r\n\r\nOn the opposing side were other writers. Tremenheere argued the\r\ninapplicability of American institutions to Great Britain[1326]. The\r\ntheoretical bases of those institutions were in some respects admirable\r\nbut in actual practice they had resulted in the rule of the mob and had\r\ndebased the nation in the estimation of the world; bribery in elections,\r\nthe low order of men in politics and in Congress, were proofs of the\r\nevils of democracy; those in England who clamoured for a \"numerical\"\r\nrather than a class representation should take warning from the American\r\nexperiment. Occasionally, though rarely, there appeared the impressions\r\nof some British traveller who had no political axe to grind[1327], but\r\nfrom 1850 to 1860, as in every previous decade, British writing on\r\nAmerica was coloured by the author's attitude on political institutions\r\nat home. The \"example\" of America was constantly on the horizon in\r\nBritish politics.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the Liberal movement in England was at its lowest ebb since the\r\nhigh tide of 1832. Palmerston was generally believed to have made a\r\nprivate agreement with Derby that both Whig and Tory parties would\r\noppose any movement toward an expansion of the franchise[1328]. Lord\r\nJohn Russell, in his youth an eager supporter of the Reform Bill of\r\n1832, had now gained the name of \"Finality John\" by his assertion that\r\nthat Reform was final in British institutions. Political reaction was in\r\nfull swing much to the discontent of Radicals like Bright and Cobden and\r\ntheir supporters. When the storm broke in America the personal\r\ncharacteristics of the two leaders North and South, Lincoln and Davis,\r\ntook on, to many British eyes, an altogether extreme importance as if\r\nrepresentative of the political philosophies of the two sections.\r\nLincoln's \"crudity\" was democratic; Davis' \"culture\" was\r\naristocratic--nor is it to be denied that Davis had \"aristocratic\" views\r\non government[1329]. But that this issue had any vital bearing on the\r\nquarrel between the American sections was never generally voiced in\r\nEngland. Rather, British comment was directed to the lesson, taught to\r\nthe world by the American crisis, of the failure of democratic\r\ninstitutions in _national power._ Bright had long preached to the\r\nunenfranchised of England the prosperity and might of America and these\r\nhad long been denied by the aristocratic faction to be a result of\r\ndemocratic institutions. At first the denial was now repeated, the\r\n_Saturday Review_, February 23, 1861, protesting that there was no\r\nessential connection between the \"shipwreck\" of American institutions\r\nand the movement in England for an expanded franchise. Even, the article\r\ncontinued, if an attempt were made to show such a connection it would\r\nconvince nobody since \"Mr. Bright has succeeded in persuading a great\r\nnumber of influential persons that the admission of working-men into the\r\nconstituencies is chiefly, if not solely, desirable on the ground that\r\nit has succeeded admirably in America and has proved a sovereign panacea\r\nagainst the war, taxation and confusion which are the curses of old\r\nGovernments in Europe.\" Yet that the denial was not sincere is shown by\r\nthe further assertion that \"the shallow demagogues of Birmingham and\r\nother kindred platforms must bear the blame of the inference, drawn\r\nnearly universally at the present moment, that, if the United States\r\nbecome involved in hopeless difficulties, it would be madness to lower\r\nthe qualification for the suffrage in England.\"\r\n\r\nThis pretended disclaimer of any essential relation between the American\r\nstruggle and British institutions was not long persisted in. A month\r\nlater the _Saturday Review_ was strong in contemptuous criticism of the\r\n\"promiscuous democracy\" of the North[1330]. Less political journals\r\nfollowed suit. The _Economist_ thought the people of England would now\r\nbe convinced of the folly of aping America and that those who had\r\nadvocated universal suffrage would be filled with \"mingled alarm,\r\ngratitude and shame[1331].\" Soon W.H. Russell could write, while still\r\nat Washington \"... the world will only see in it all, the failure of\r\nrepublican institutions in time of pressure as demonstrated by all\r\nhistory--that history which America vainly thought she was going to set\r\nright and re-establish on new grounds and principles[1332].\" \"The\r\nEnglish worshippers of American institutions,\" said the _Saturday\r\nReview_, \"are in danger of losing their last pretext for preferring the\r\nRepublic to the obsolete and tyrannical Monarchy of England.... It now\r\nappears that the peaceable completion of the secession has become\r\nimpossible, and it will be necessary to discover some new ground of\r\nsuperiority by which Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Lincoln may be advantageously\r\ncontrasted with Queen Victoria[1333].\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions antedated the news of the actual opening of the war\r\nand may be regarded as jeers at Bright and his followers rather than as\r\nattempts to read a lesson to the public. No such expressions are to be\r\nfound in the letters of leading officials though minor ones occasionally\r\nindulged in them[1334]. As late as June, 1861, Adams declared that while\r\nsome in England welcomed American disunion as a warning to their\r\ncountrymen it was evident that but a small number as yet saw the cause\r\nof the North as identical with the world progress of free\r\ninstitutions[1335]. Evidently he was disappointed that the followers of\r\nBright were not exhibiting more courage and demanding public support of\r\nthe North as fighting their battle at home. They were indeed strangely\r\nsilent, depressed no doubt by American events, and discouraged. It\r\nrequired time also to arouse intensity of feeling on the American\r\nquestion and to see clearly the issues involved. Aristocratic Britain\r\nwas first to declare a definite lesson to be learned, thereby bringing\r\nout the fighting qualities of British democracy. Throughout 1861, the\r\ncomment was relatively mild. In July, _Blackwood's_ declared:\r\n\r\n     \"It is precisely because we do not share the admiration of\r\n     America for her own institutions and political tendencies\r\n     that we do not now see in the impending change an event\r\n     altogether to be deplored. In those institutions and\r\n     tendencies we saw what our own might be if the most dangerous\r\n     elements of our Constitution should become dominant. We saw\r\n     democracy rampant, with no restriction upon its caprices. We\r\n     saw a policy which received its impulses always from below\r\n     ... nor need we affect particularly to lament the exhibition\r\n     of the weak point of a Constitution ... the disruption of\r\n     which leaves entirely untouched the laws and usages which\r\n     America owes to England, and which have contributed so\r\n     powerfully to her prosperity....\"\r\n\r\n     \"With a rival Government on the frontier ... with great\r\n     principles to be not vapoured about but put to the proof we\r\n     should probably see the natural aristocracy rise from the\r\n     dead level of the Republic, raising the national character\r\n     with its own elevation[1336].\"\r\n\r\nIn the same month the _Quarterly_, always more calm, logical and\r\nconvincing than _Blackwood's_, published \"Democracy on its Trial[1337].\"\r\n\"The example of America kept alive, as it had created, the party of\r\nprogress\"; now \"it has sunk from the decrepitude of premature old age.\"\r\nIf England, after such an example, permits herself to be led into\r\ndemocracy she \"will have perished by that wilful infatuation which no\r\nwarning can dispel.\"\r\n\r\nAdams had complained that few British friends of progress identified the\r\ncause of the North with their own, but this was true of Americans also.\r\nThe _Atlantic Monthly_ for July 1861, discussed British attitude wholly\r\nin terms of cotton supply. But soon there appeared in the British press\r\nso many preachments on the \"lesson\" of America that the aristocratic\r\neffort to gain an advantage at home became apparent to all[1338]. The\r\n_Economist_ moralized on the \"untried\" character of American\r\ninstitutions and statesmen, the latter usually as ignorant as the\r\n\"masses\" whom they represented and if more intellectual still more\r\nworthy of contempt because of their \"voluntary moral degradation\" to the\r\nlevel of their constituents[1339]. \"The upper and ruling class\" wrote\r\nBright to Sumner, were observing with satisfaction, \"that democracy may\r\nget into trouble, and war, and debt, and taxes, as aristocracy has done\r\nfor this country[1340].\" Thus Bright could not deny the blow to\r\ndemocracy; nor could the _Spectator_, upbraiding its countrymen for lack\r\nof sympathy with the North: \"New England will be justified in saying\r\nthat Old England's anti-slavery sympathies are mere hollow sentimental\r\npretences, since she can rest satisfied to stuff her ears with cotton\r\nagainst the cries of the slaves, and to compensate her gentle regret\r\nover the new impulse given to slavery by her lively gratification over\r\nthe paralyzing shock suffered by Democracy[1341].\" This was no taking up\r\nof cudgels for the North and \"Progress\" such as Adams had hoped for.\r\nVigour rested with the opposing side and increased when hopes of a short\r\nwar vanished. The _Saturday Review_ asserted:\r\n\r\n     \"In that reconstruction of political philosophy which the\r\n     American calamities are likely to inaugurate, the value of\r\n     the popular element will be reduced to its due\r\n     proportions.... The true guarantee of freedom will be looked\r\n     for more in the equilibrium of classes than in the equality\r\n     of individuals.... We may hope, at last, that the delusive\r\n     confusion between freedom and democracy is finally banished\r\n     from the minds of Englishmen[1342].\"\r\n\r\n\"The real secret,\" wrote Motley, \"of the exultation which manifests\r\nitself in the _Times_ and other organs over our troubles and disasters,\r\nis their hatred, not to America, so much as to democracy in\r\nEngland[1343].\" It was scarcely a secret in the columns of the journals\r\nalready quoted. But no similar interpretation had as yet appeared in the\r\n_Times_ and Motley's implication was justified for it and other leading\r\ndaily newspapers. The Reviews and Weeklies were for the moment leading\r\nthe attack--possibly one reason for the slowness in reply of Bright and\r\nhis followers. Not all Reviews joined in the usual analysis. The\r\n_Edinburgh_ at first saw in slavery the sole cause of the American\r\ndispute[1344], then attributed it to the inevitable failure in power of\r\na federal system of government, not mentioning democracy as in\r\nquestion[1345]. _Blackwood's_ repeatedly pushed home its argument:\r\n\r\n     \"Independent of motives of humanity, we are glad that the end\r\n     of the Union seems more likely to be ridiculous than\r\n     terrible.... But for our own benefit and the instruction of\r\n     the world we wish to see the faults, so specious and so\r\n     fatal, of their political system exposed, in the most\r\n     effective way.... And the venerable Lincoln, the respectable\r\n     Seward, the raving editors, the gibbering mob, and the\r\n     swift-footed warriors of Bull's Run, are no malicious tricks\r\n     of fortune played off on an unwary nation, but are all of\r\n     them the legitimate offspring of the great Republic ...\r\n     dandled and nursed--one might say coddled--by Fortune, the\r\n     spoiled child Democracy, after playing strange pranks before\r\n     high heaven, and figuring in odd and unexpected disguises,\r\n     dies as sheerly from lack of vitality as the oldest of\r\n     worn-out despotisms.... In the hope that this contest may end\r\n     in the extinction of mob rule, we become reconciled to the\r\n     much slighter amount of suffering that war inflicts on\r\n     America[1346].\"\r\n\r\nEqually outspoken were a few public men who early espoused the cause of\r\nthe South. Beresford Hope, before a \"distinguished audience\" used\r\nlanguage insulting to the North, fawning upon the South and picturing\r\nthe latter as wholly admirable for its aristocratic tendencies. For this\r\nhe was sharply taken to task by the _Spectator_[1347]. More sedately the\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury proclaimed, \"I see in America the trial of Democracy\r\nand its failure. I believe that the dissolution of the Union is\r\ninevitable, and that men now before me will live to see an aristocracy\r\nestablished in America[1348].\" In all countries and at all times there\r\nare men over-eager in early prophecy on current events, but in such\r\nutterances as these there is manifest not merely the customary desire to\r\nstand in the limelight of assured knowledge and wisdom, but also the\r\nhappy conviction that events in America were working to the undoing of\r\nthe Radicals of Great Britain. If they would not be supine the Radicals\r\nmust strike back. On December 4, at Rochdale where, as the _Times_\r\nasserted, he was sure of an audience sympathetic on purely personal\r\ngrounds, Bright renewed his profession of faith in the American Republic\r\nand sang his accustomed praises of its great accomplishments[1349]. The\r\nbattle, for England, on American democracy, was joined; the challenge\r\nissued by aristocratic England, accepted.\r\n\r\nBut apart from extreme factions at either end of the scale there stood a\r\ngroup holding a middle ground opinion, not yet sure of the historical\r\nsignificance of the American collapse. To this group belonged Gladstone,\r\nas yet uncertain of his political philosophy, and regretful, though\r\nvainly, it would appear, of the blow to democracy. He wrote his thought\r\nto Brougham, no doubt hoping to influence the view-point of the\r\n_Edinburgh_.\r\n\r\n     \"This has without doubt been a deplorable year for poor\r\n     'Democracy' and never has the old woman been at a heavier\r\n     discount since 1793. I see no discredit to the founders of\r\n     the American constitution in the main fact of the rupture.\r\n     On the contrary it was a great achievement to strike off by\r\n     the will and wit of man a constitution for two millions of\r\n     men scattered along a seaboard, which has lasted until they\r\n     have become more than thirty millions and have covered a\r\n     whole continent. But the freaks, pranks, and follies, not to\r\n     say worse, with which the rupture has been met in the\r\n     Northern States, down to Mr. Chase's financial (not\r\n     exposition but) exposure have really given as I have said the\r\n     old lady in question such a heavy blow and great\r\n     discouragement that I hope you will in the first vigour of\r\n     your action be a little merciful and human lest you murder\r\n     her outright[1350].\"\r\n\r\nOn this middle group of Englishmen and their moral conceptions the\r\nAmerican Minister, Adams, at first pinned his faith, not believing in\r\n1861 that the issues of democracy or of trade advantage would lead Great\r\nBritain from just rules of conduct. Even in the crisis of the _Trent_\r\naffair he was firm in this opinion:\r\n\r\n     \"Much as the commercial and manufacturing interests may be\r\n     disposed to view the tariff as the source of all our evils,\r\n     and much as the aristocratic classes may endeavour to make\r\n     democracy responsible for them, the inexorable logic of\r\n     events is contradicting each and every assertion based on\r\n     these notions, and proving that the American struggle is,\r\n     after all, the ever-recurring one in human affairs between\r\n     right and wrong, between labour and capital, between liberty\r\n     and absolutism. When such an issue comes to be presented to\r\n     the people of Great Britain, stripped of all the disguises\r\n     which have been thrown over it, it is not difficult to\r\n     predict at least which side it will _not_ consent to\r\n     take[1351].\r\n\r\nApril, 1861, saw the beginning of the aristocratic challenge on American\r\ndemocracy and December its acceptance by Bright. Throughout 1862 he\r\npractically deserted his seat in Parliament and devoted himself to\r\nstirring up labour and radical sentiment in favour of the North. In\r\nJanuary, 1862, a mass meeting at New Hall, Edgware Road, denounced the\r\ndaily press and was thought of sufficient moment to be reported by\r\nAdams. A motion was carried:\r\n\r\n     \"That in the opinion of this meeting, considering the\r\n     ill-disguised efforts of the _Times_ and other misleading\r\n     journals to misrepresent public opinion here on all American\r\n     questions ... to decry democratic institutions under the\r\n     trials to which the Republic is exposed, it is the duty of\r\n     the working-men especially as unrepresented in the National\r\n     Senate to express their sympathy with the United States in\r\n     their gigantic struggle for the preservation of the\r\n     Union[1352]....\"\r\n\r\nThe daily press was, in fact, now joining more openly in the\r\ncontroversy. The _Morning Post_, stating with conviction its belief that\r\nthere could be no re-union in America, added:\r\n\r\n     \"... if the Government of the United States should succeed in\r\n     reannexing them [the Southern States] to its still extensive\r\n     dominions, Democracy will have achieved its grandest triumph\r\n     since the world began. It will have demonstrated to the ample\r\n     satisfaction of its present and future proselytes that it is\r\n     even more puissant in war than in peace; that it can navigate\r\n     not only the smooth seas of unendangered prosperity, but can\r\n     ride safely through the fiercest tempests that would engulf\r\n     every other craft laden with human destinies; that it can\r\n     descend to the darkest depths of adversity, and rise from\r\n     them all the stronger for the descent.... And who can doubt\r\n     that Democracy will be more arrogant, more aggressive, more\r\n     levelling and vulgarizing, if that be possible, than it ever\r\n     had been before[1353].\"\r\n\r\nBy midsummer, 1862, Adams was more convinced than in 1861 that the\r\npolitical controversy in England had an important bearing on the\r\nattitude toward America. Even the alleged neutrality of _Fraser's\r\nMagazine_ seemed turning to one-sided presentation of the \"lesson\" of\r\nAmerica. Mill's defence of the North, appearing in the February number,\r\nwas soon followed in July by the first of a series of articles,\r\n\"Universal Suffrage in the United States and Its Consequences,\"\r\ndepicting the war as the result of mob rule and predicting a military\r\ndespotism as its inevitable consequence. The Liberals were losing\r\nstrength, wrote Adams:\r\n\r\n     \"That the American difficulties have materially contributed\r\n     to this result cannot be doubted. The fact that many of the\r\n     leading Liberals are the declared friends of the United\r\n     States is a decided disadvantage in the contest now going on.\r\n     The predominating passion here is the desire for the ultimate\r\n     subdivision of America into many separate States which will\r\n     neutralize each other. This is most visible among the\r\n     conservative class of the Aristocracy who dread the growth of\r\n     liberal opinions and who habitually regard America as the\r\n     nursery of them[1354].\"\r\n\r\nFrom all this controversy Government leaders kept carefully aloof at\r\nleast in public expression of opinion. Privately, Russell commented to\r\nPalmerston, \"I have been reading a book on Jefferson by De Witt, which\r\nis both interesting and instructive. It shows how the Great Republic of\r\nWashington degenerated into the Democracy of Jefferson. They are now\r\nreaping the fruit[1355].\" Was it mere coincidence or was there\r\nsignificance in an editorial in Palmerston's alleged \"organ,\" the\r\n_Morning Post_:\r\n\r\n     \"That any Englishman has looked forward with pleasure to the\r\n     calamities of America is notoriously and demonstrably false.\r\n     But we have no hesitation in admitting that many thoughtful\r\n     Englishmen who have watched, in the policy of the United\r\n     States during the last twenty years, the foreshadowing of a\r\n     democratic tyranny compared with which the most corrupt\r\n     despotisms of the Old World appear realms of idyllic\r\n     happiness and peace, have gratefully recognized the finger of\r\n     Providence in the strife by which they have been so\r\n     frightfully rent asunder[1356]....\"\r\n\r\nIn October the heavy artillery of the Conservatives was again brought\r\ninto action and this time with more explicit diagnosis than heretofore.\r\n\"For a great number of years,\" said the _Quarterly_, \"a certain party\r\namong us, great admirers of America ... have chosen to fight their\r\nEnglish battles upon American soil.\" Now the American Government \"has\r\ndisgracefully and ignominiously failed\" at all points. It is evident\r\nthat \"political equality is not merely a folly, it is a chimera[1357].\"\r\nAt last, in November, the _Times_ openly took the position which its\r\naccusers declared to have been the basis of its editorial utterances\r\nalmost from the beginning of the Civil War.\r\n\r\n     \"These are the consequences of a cheap and simple form of\r\n     government, having a rural attorney for Sovereign and a city\r\n     attorney for Prime Minister. We have already said that if\r\n     such a terrible exposure of incapacity had happened in\r\n     England we should at the earliest moment possible have sent\r\n     the incapables about their business, and put ourselves in the\r\n     hands of better men....\"\r\n\r\n     \"This Republic has been so often proposed to us as a model\r\n     for imitation that we should be unpardonable not to mark how\r\n     it works now, when for the first time it has some work to do.\r\n     We believe that if the English system of Parliamentary action\r\n     had existed in America, the war could not have occurred, but\r\n     we are quite sure that such Ministers would have long since\r\n     been changed[1358].\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to a Conservative ringing the changes upon the failure of\r\ndemocracy, the open friends of the South dilated also upon the\r\n\"gentlemanly\" characteristics of Southern leaders and society. This was\r\nthe frequent burden of articles in _The Index_ in the early weeks of its\r\npublication. To this was soon added a picture of Northern democracy as\r\ncomposed of and controlled by the \"immigrant element\" which was the\r\nsource of \"the enormous increase of population in the last thirty years\"\r\nfrom revolutionary areas in Europe. \"Germans, Hungarians, Irish carried\r\nwith them more than their strong arms, they imported also their theories\r\nof equality.... The revolutionary party which represents them is at this\r\nmoment master in the States of the North, where it is indulging in all\r\nits customary licence[1359].\" This fact, complained _The Index_, was not\r\nsufficiently brought out in the English press. Very different was the\r\npicture painted by Anthony Trollope after a tour of the Western states:\r\n\r\n     \"... this man has his romance, his high poetic feeling, and\r\n     above all his manly dignity. Visit him, and you will find him\r\n     without coat or waistcoat, unshorn, in ragged blue trousers\r\n     and old flannel shirt, too often bearing on his lantern jaws\r\n     the signs of ague and sickness; but he will stand upright\r\n     before you and speak to you with all the ease of a lettered\r\n     gentleman in his own library. All the odious incivility of\r\n     the republican servant has been banished. He is his own\r\n     master, standing on his own threshold, and finds no need to\r\n     assert his equality by rudeness. He is delighted to see you,\r\n     and bids you sit down on his battered bench, without dreaming\r\n     of any such apology as an English cotter offers to a Lady\r\n     Bountiful when she calls. He has worked out his independence,\r\n     and shows it in every easy movement of his body. He tells you\r\n     of it unconsciously in every tone of his voice. You will\r\n     always find in his cabin some newspaper, some book, some\r\n     token of advance in education. When he questions you about\r\n     the old country he astonishes you by the extent of his\r\n     knowledge. I defy you not to feel that he is superior to the\r\n     race from whence he has sprung in England or in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"It is always the same story. With us there is no level of\r\n     society. Men stand on a long staircase, but the crowd\r\n     congregates near the bottom, and the lower steps are very\r\n     broad. In America men stand upon a common platform, but the\r\n     platform is raised above the ground, though it does not\r\n     approach in height the top of our staircase. If we take the\r\n     average altitude in the two countries, we shall find that the\r\n     American heads are the more elevated of the two[1360].\"\r\n\r\nA comparison of dates shows that the unanimity of conservative and\r\naristocratic expression on the failure of American democracy and its\r\nlesson to England was most marked and most open at the moment when the\r\nGovernment was seriously considering an offer of mediation in the war.\r\nMeanwhile the emancipation proclamation of September, 1862, had\r\nappeared. It did not immediately affect governmental attitude, save\r\nadversely to the North, and it gave a handle for pro-Southern outcry on\r\nthe score of a \"servile war.\" Indeed, the radicals were at first\r\ndepressed by it; but when months passed with no appearance of a servile\r\nwar and when the second emancipation proclamation of January, 1863,\r\nfurther certified the moral purpose of the North, a great element of\r\nstrength was added to the English advocates of democracy. The numerous\r\n\"addresses\" to Lincoln exhibited both a revived moral enthusiasm for the\r\ncause of anti-slavery and were frequently combined with a laudation of\r\nAmerican political institutions. The great mass-meeting at Exeter Hall,\r\nJanuary 29, 1863, was described by the correspondent of an American\r\npaper as largely deriving its strength from the universal\r\ndissatisfaction of the lower orders of the English people with their\r\nexisting conditions under the Crown:\r\n\r\n     \"The descendants of the Roundhead commoners, chafing under\r\n     the limitations of the franchise, burdensome taxation, the\r\n     contempt with which they are regarded by the lords of the\r\n     soil, the grievous effects of the laws of entail and\r\n     primogeniture, whereby they are kept poor and rendered liable\r\n     to starvation and pauperism--these have looked to America as\r\n     the model democracy which proves the poor man's capacity for\r\n     self-government.\" The meeting was called for seven o'clock\r\n     but at half after five the hall was filled, and at six\r\n     crowded. A second hall was filled and outdoor meetings of two\r\n     thousand people organized in Exeter Street. \"All\r\n     working-class England was up in arms, not so much against\r\n     slavery as against British oligarchy[1361].\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondent further reported rumours that this meeting had caused\r\nanxious consideration to the managers of the _Times_, and the decision\r\nto step more warily. No doubt this was exaggeration of the political\r\ncharacter and effect of the meeting, but certain it is that the\r\npolitical element was present joining hands with anti-slavery\r\nenthusiasm. Also it is noteworthy that the last confident and vigorous\r\nexpression of the \"failure\" of democracy, from sources professedly\r\nneutral, appeared immediately after the St. James' Hall meeting, but was\r\nnecessarily written before that meeting took place. _Blackwood's_, in\r\nits issue of February, 1863, declared, as before: \"Every sensible man in\r\nthis country now acknowledges ... that we have already gone as far\r\ntoward democracy as is safe to go.... This is the great moral benefit\r\nwhich we have derived from the events in America.\" John Blackwood was an\r\nintimate friend of Delane, editor of the _Times_, holding similar views\r\non political questions; but the _Times_ was suddenly grown cautious in\r\nreading English political lessons from America. In truth, attack now\r\nrested with the Radicals and Bright's oratory was in great demand[1362].\r\nHe now advanced from the defensive position of laudation of the North to\r\nthe offensive one of attacking the Southern aristocracy, not merely\r\nbecause it wished to perpetuate African slavery, but because it desired\r\nto make all the working-classes as subservient to it as was the\r\nnegro[1363]. It was now Radical purpose to keep the battle raging and\r\nthey were succeeding. Bigelow believed that the United States might well\r\nrecognize its opportunity in this controversy and give aid to\r\nits friends:\r\n\r\n     \"After all, this struggle of ours both at home and abroad is\r\n     but a struggle between the principle of popular government\r\n     and government by a privileged class. The people therefore\r\n     all the world over are in a species of solidarity which it is\r\n     our duty and interest to cultivate to the utmost[1364].\"\r\n\r\nBut Adams gave contrary advice. Wholly sympathetic with the democratic\r\nmovement in England as now, somewhat to his surprise, developed, he yet\r\nfeared that the extremes to which Bright and others were going in\r\nsupport of the North might create unfortunate reactions in the\r\nGovernment. Especially he was anxious that the United States should not\r\noffer opportunity for accusation of interference in a British political\r\nquarrel. It is noteworthy that while many addresses to Lincoln were\r\nforwarded by him and many were printed in the annual publication of\r\ndiplomatic correspondence, those that thus appeared dealt almost\r\nexclusively with emancipation. Yet Adams was also forwarding addresses\r\nand speeches harping on American democracy. A meeting at Edinburgh,\r\nFebruary 19, found place, in its emancipation aspect in the United\r\nStates documents[1365], but the burden of that meeting, democracy, did\r\nnot. It was there proclaimed that the British press misrepresented\r\nconditions in America, \"because the future of free political\r\ninstitutions, as sketched in the American Declaration of Independence\r\nand in the State Constitutions of the Northern States, would be a\r\nstanding argument against the expansion of the franchise and the\r\nenjoyment of just political rights among us, as well as a convenient\r\nargument in favour of the continued domination of our aristocratic\r\nparties[1366].\" The tide of democratic feeling was rising rapidly in\r\nEngland. On March 26, Adams wrote to Seward of a recent debate in\r\nParliament that that body was much more judicious in expressions on\r\nAmerica than it had been before 1862. \"It will not escape your\r\nobservation that the question is now felt to be taking a shape which was\r\nscarcely anticipated by the managers [of the _Times_] when they first\r\nundertook to guide the British mind to the overthrow of free\r\ninstitutions in America[1367].\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day on which this was written there occurred the\r\ngreatest, most outspoken, and most denunciatory to the aristocracy, of\r\nthe meetings held to support the cause of the North. This was the\r\nspectacular gathering of the Trades Unions of London at St. James' Hall,\r\non March 26, usually regarded as the culminating effort in Bright's tour\r\nof England for the cause of democracy, but whose origin is somewhat\r\nshrouded in mystery. Socialist tradition claims that Karl Marx conceived\r\nthe idea of the meeting and was responsible for its organization[1368].\r\nThe press generally reported it as a \"Bright Meeting.\" Adams wrote to\r\nSeward of the pressure put on him by Professor Beesly, of the University\r\nof London, to send a representative from the American Ministry, Beesly\r\nexpanding upon the importance and high standing of the Trades Unions. To\r\nthis Adams demurred but finally sent his son to sit in the audience and\r\nreport the proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin there can be no doubt that this was the most\r\nimportant of all pro-Northern meetings held in England during the Civil\r\nWar, nor that its keynote was \"America fighting the battle of\r\ndemocracy.\" Save for some distinguished speakers those in attendance\r\nconsisted almost wholly of three thousand picked representatives of the\r\nTrades Unions of London. Adams transmitted to Seward his son's report of\r\nthe meeting, its character, composition, names of speakers and their\r\nemphatic expressions of friendship for the North[1369], but it is again\r\nnoteworthy that Henry Adams' clear analysis of the real significance of\r\nthe meeting was not printed in the published diplomatic correspondence.\r\nGiving due praise to the speeches of Bright and Beesly, and commenting\r\non press assertions that \"the extraordinary numbers there were only\r\nbrought together by their curiosity to hear Mr. Bright,\" Henry Adams\r\ncontinued: \"That this was not the case must have been evident to every\r\nperson present. In fact, it was only after he closed that the real\r\nbusiness of the evening began.\" Then followed speeches and the\r\nintroduction of resolutions by \"Mr. Howell, a bricklayer ... Mr. Odgers,\r\na shoemaker ... Mr. Mantz, a compositor ... Mr. Cremer, a joiner, who\r\nwas bitter against Lord Palmerston ... Mr. Conolly, a mason....\" and\r\nother labouring men, all asserting \"that the success of free\r\ninstitutions in America was a political question of deep consequence in\r\nEngland and that they would not tolerate any interference unfavourable\r\nto the North.\" No one, the report emphasized, \"could doubt what was\r\nintended.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting was a demonstration of democratic strength and\r\n     no concealment of this fact was made. If it did not have a\r\n     direct political bearing on internal politics in England it\r\n     needed little of doing so. There was not even a profession of\r\n     faith in the government of England as at present constituted.\r\n     Every hostile allusion to the Aristocracy, the Church, the\r\n     opinions of the 'privileged classes,' was received with warm\r\n     cheers. Every allusion to the republican institutions of\r\n     America, the right of suffrage, the right of self-taxation,\r\n     the 'sunlight' of republican influence, was caught up by the\r\n     audience with vehement applause. It may therefore be\r\n     considered as fairly and authoritatively announced that the\r\n     class of skilled workmen in London--that is the leaders of\r\n     the pure popular movement in England--have announced by an\r\n     act almost without precedent in their history, the principle\r\n     that they make common cause with the Americans who are\r\n     struggling for the restoration of the Union and that all\r\n     their power and influence shall be used on behalf of the\r\n     North[1370].\"\r\n\r\nBright's words of most scarifying indictment of \"Privilege,\" and his\r\nappeal to workers to join hands with their fellows in America have been\r\ngiven in a previous chapter[1371]. Evidently that appeal, though\r\nenthusiastically received for its oratorical brilliance, was unneeded.\r\nHis was but an eloquent expression of that which was in the minds of his\r\naudience. Upon the American Minister the effect was to cause him to\r\nrenew warnings against showing too keen an appreciation of the support\r\nof political radicalism in England. The meeting, he wrote, had at once\r\nstirred anxiety in Parliament and verged:\r\n\r\n     \"... much too closely upon the minatory in the domestic\r\n     politics of this Kingdom to make it easy to recognize or\r\n     sympathize with by Foreign Governments.... Hence it seems to\r\n     me of the greatest consequence that the treatment of all\r\n     present questions between the two nations should be regulated\r\n     by a provident forecast of what may follow it [the political\r\n     struggle in England] hereafter. I am not sure that some\r\n     parties here would not now be willing even to take the risk\r\n     of a war in order the more effectually to turn the scale\r\n     against us, and thus, as they think, to crush the rising\r\n     spirit of their own population. That this is only a feeling\r\n     at present and has not yet risen to the dignity of a policy\r\n     may be true enough; but that does not the less impose upon\r\n     the Government at home a duty so to shape its actions as, if\r\n     possible, to defeat all such calculations and dissipate such\r\n     hopes.... We owe this duty not less to the great body of\r\n     those who in this kingdom are friends to us and our\r\n     institutions, than to ourselves[1372].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT (_From a photograph taken of him in the\r\nattitude in which he usually spoke_) (_From Trevelyan's \"Life of John\r\nBright_\")]\r\n\r\nThus Adams advised his Government to tread lightly in respect to\r\ndemocratic agitation in England. Over a month later he received a\r\ndeputation headed by Bright, come to present to him the resolutions\r\npassed at the Trades Unions' meeting. The deputation expressed fears\r\nthat a rupture was imminent in the relations of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica, and that this would have a disastrous influence on the\r\naspirations of working-class Europe. Adams replied in general terms of\r\nappreciation for the sympathies expressed by the meeting but\r\ncarefully avoided specific comment on its democratic purpose. \"He was\r\ntoo prudent,\" said the _Times_ in reporting the deputation, \"to appraise\r\nthe importance of the particular demonstration to which his notice was\r\ninvited ...\" and his reply was given favourable comment[1373]. This\r\nreply, wrote Adams, \"appears to have had a sedative effect[1374].\"\r\nMeanwhile, Bright continued his preachment to the English people though\r\nmodifying his tone of fierce accusation against \"privilege,\" and\r\nconfining himself to declaring the interest of the unenfranchised in the\r\nAmerican conflict. In a speech before the Union and Emancipation Society\r\nof London, on June 16, he asserted for the \"twenty millions of people in\r\nthis country\" as yet without representation in Parliament, \"I say that\r\nthese have an interest, almost as great and direct as though they were\r\nliving in Massachusetts or New York, in the tremendous struggle for\r\nfreedom which is now shaking the whole North American Continent[1375].\"\r\nLike utterances were repeated at further public meetings and so\r\ninsistent were they as to require reply by the conservative faction,\r\neven if, as was supposed, the effect of the Trades' Union attitude had\r\nbeen to give a halt to the vehemence of those who had been sounding the\r\n\"lesson\" of American failure in democracy. Bright became the centre of\r\nattack. The _Times_ led.\r\n\r\n     \"His is a political fanaticism. He used to idolize the\r\n     Constitution of the United States as the one great dominant\r\n     Democracy of the world. He believes in it still, and, if it\r\n     must go, he is ready to idolize its memory. For this he gives\r\n     up all his most cherished notions and all his less absorbing\r\n     principles....\"\r\n\r\n     \"Yet Mr. Bright is consistent. He has one master passion and\r\n     his breast, capacious as it is, can hold no more. That master\r\n     passion is the love of that great dominant Democracy. He\r\n     worshipped it while rising to its culminating point, and he\r\n     is obliged to turn right round to worship it while setting.\r\n     He did not himself know, until tested by this great trial,\r\n     how entirely his opinions as to war and peace, and slavery\r\n     and freedom, and lust of conquest and hatred of oppression,\r\n     were all the mere accidents which hung loosely upon him, and\r\n     were capable of being detached at once in the interest of the\r\n     ruling passion of his soul for that great dominant Democracy.\r\n     Nor need we wonder; for if that great Democracy has been a\r\n     failure, then men will say that the life of Mr. John Bright\r\n     up to this time has been but a foolish dream[1376].\"\r\n\r\nEvidently Bright's speeches were causing anxiety and bitterness; but an\r\n\"if\" had crept into the estimate of the future of American democracy,\r\ncaused less by the progress of the war than by the rising excitement of\r\ndemocratic England. The _Times_ editorial just quoted appeared when the\r\nfaith was generally professed that Lee was about to end the war through\r\nthe invasion of Pennsylvania. In the reaction created by the arrival of\r\nthe news of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Adams still again warned his\r\nGovernment against either a belligerent or interfering attitude toward\r\nGreat Britain, but stated plainly that Northern victory was of supreme\r\nimportance in Europe itself. \"We have a mission to fulfill. It is to\r\nshow, by our example to the people of England in particular, and to all\r\nnations in general, the value of republican institutions.\" There was\r\nstill a general belief in the incompetency of those institutions. \"The\r\ngreatest triumph of all would be to prove these calculations vain. In\r\ncomparison with this, what would be the gain to be derived from any\r\ncollision with the powers of Europe[1377]?\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange that with so clearly-expressed a division of English\r\nopinion on American democracy few in America itself appreciated the\r\nsignificance of the British controversy. J. M. Forbes, who had been on a\r\nspecial mission to England, wrote to Lincoln, on his return[1378]:\r\n\r\n     \"Our friends abroad see it! John Bright and his glorious band\r\n     of English Republicans see that we are fighting for Democracy\r\n     or (to get rid of the technical name) for liberal\r\n     institutions; the Democrats and the liberals of the old world\r\n     are as much and as heartily with us as any supporters we have\r\n     on this side.\r\n\r\n     Our enemies too see it in the same light; the Aristocrats and\r\n     the Despots of the old world see that our quarrel is that of\r\n     the People against an Aristocracy[1379].\"\r\n\r\nBut there are few similar expressions and these few nearly always came\r\nfrom men who had been abroad and had thus come into direct contact with\r\nBritish political movements. Meanwhile, Lee's retreat from Pennsylvania\r\nhad produced a like retreat in the opinions on the failure of democracy\r\nearlier confidently held by the professedly neutral press. In September,\r\nhaving arrived at the point by the usual process of gradually facing\r\nabout, the _Times_ was bold enough to deny that England had any personal\r\nfeeling or concern about democracy in America or that this had anything\r\nto do with English attitude on the war[1380]. Thenceforth neither the\r\n_Times_ nor any of the leading papers saw fit to revive with vigour the\r\ncry of \"democracy's failure,\" no matter how persistent in proclaiming\r\nultimate victory for the South. Aristocratic exultation had given place\r\nto alarm and it seemed wiser, if possible, to quiet the issue[1381]. Not\r\nso the Radicals, who made every effort to keep the issue alive in the\r\nminds of the British public, and whose leaders with less violence but\r\nincreased firmness debated the question in every public meeting\r\nfavourable to the North[1382]. Many Conservatives, Adams reported, were\r\nnow anxiously sitting on the fence yet finding the posture a difficult\r\none because of their irritation at Bright's taunts[1383]. Bright's star\r\nwas rising. \"The very moment the war comes to an end,\" wrote Adams, \"and\r\na restoration of the Union follows, it will be the signal for a reaction\r\nthat will make Mr. Bright perhaps the most formidable public man in\r\nEngland[1384].\"\r\n\r\nThe continuation of the controversy was not, however, wholly one-sided.\r\nIn the silence of the daily press it seemed incumbent upon the more\r\neager and professed friends of the South to take up the cudgels. Hence,\r\nin part, came the organization of the Southern Independence Association\r\nand the attempt to hold public meetings favourable to the South, in the\r\nearly months of 1864. Much talk had been spent on the \"British issue\"\r\ninvolved in the war; there was now to be vigorous work to secure\r\nit[1385]. _The Index _plunged into vigorous denunciation of \"The\r\nManchester School, which, for convenience and truth, we had better for\r\nthe future call the American School.\" Even the Government was attacked\r\nfor its complacence under the \"American danger\" and for retaining as a\r\nmember Milner-Gibson, who, in a recent speech, had shown that he shared\r\nBright's views on democracy:\r\n\r\n     \"That gentleman [Bright] could not be asked to enter the\r\n     Cabinet in person. The country abhorred him; Parliament\r\n     despised him; his inveterate habits of slander and\r\n     vituperation, his vulgarity, and his incurable want of\r\n     veracity, had made him so hateful to the educated classes\r\n     that it would have required no common courage to give him\r\n     office; his insolent sneers at royalty would have made his\r\n     appointment little less than a personal insult to the Queen;\r\n     and his bad temper would have made him an intolerable\r\n     colleague in the Council. But Mr. Bright had another self; a\r\n     faithful shadow, which had no ideas, no soul, no other\r\n     existence but what it borrowed from him, while its previous\r\n     life and education had accustomed it to the society of\r\n     statesmen and of gentlemen[1386].\"\r\n\r\nSuch expressions gained nothing for the Conservative cause; they were\r\ntoo evidently the result of alarm at the progress of Radical and\r\npro-Northern sentiment. Goldwin Smith in a \"Letter\" to the Southern\r\nIndependence Association, analysed with clarity the situation. Answering\r\ncriticisms of the passionate mob spirit of Northern press and people, he\r\naccused the _Times_ of having\r\n\r\n     \"... pandered to the hatred of America among the upper\r\n     classes of this country during the present war. Some of us at\r\n     least had been taught by what we have lately seen not to\r\n     shrink from an extension of the suffrage, if the only bad\r\n     consequence of that measure of justice would be a change in\r\n     government from the passions of the privileged class to the\r\n     passions of the people.... History will not mistake the\r\n     meaning of the loud cry of triumph which burst from the\r\n     hearts of all who openly or secretly hated liberty and\r\n     progress, at the fall, as they fondly supposed, of the Great\r\n     Republic.\" British working men \"are for the most part as well\r\n     aware that the cause of those who are fighting for the right\r\n     of labour is theirs, as any nobleman in your Association can\r\n     be that the other cause in his[1387].\"\r\n\r\nThe question of democracy as a political philosophy and as an\r\ninstitution for Great Britain was, by 1864, rapidly coming to the front\r\nin politics. This was very largely a result of the American Civil War.\r\nRoebuck, after the failure of his effort for mediation in 1863, was\r\nobsessed with a fear of the tendency in England. \"I have great faith in\r\nmy countrymen,\" he wrote, \"but the experience of America frightens me. I\r\nam not ashamed to use the word _frightened_. During my whole life I have\r\nlooked to that country as about to solve the great problem of\r\nself-government, and now, in my old age, the hopes of my youth and\r\nmanhood are destroyed, and I am left to reconstruct my political\r\nphilosophy, and doubt and hesitation beset me on every point[1388].\"\r\nMore philosophically Matthew Arnold, in 1864, characterized the rule of\r\naristocracy as inevitably passing, but bent his thought to the discovery\r\nof some middle ground or method--some \"influence [which] may help us to\r\nprevent the English people from becoming, with the growth of democracy,\r\n_Americanized_[1389].\" \"There is no longer any sort of disguise\r\nmaintained,\" wrote Adams, \"as to the wishes of the privileged classes.\r\nVery little genuine sympathy is entertained for the rebels. The true\r\nmotive is apparent enough. It is the fear of the spread of democratic\r\nfeeling at home in the event of our success[1390].\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1864 had witnessed a rapid retreat by wiser Conservative\r\nelements in proclaming the \"lesson\" of American democracy--a retreat\r\ncaused by alarm at the vigour with which Radicals had taken up the\r\nchallenge. Conservative hopes were still fixed upon Southern success and\r\nConservative confidence loudly voiced. Even the pride of the _Times_ in\r\nthe accuracy of its news and in its military forecasts was subordinated\r\nto the purpose of keeping up the courage of the faction it\r\nrepresented[1391]. Small wonder, then, that Delane, on receiving the\r\nnews of Sherman's arrival before Savannah, should be made physically ill\r\nand write to Dasent: \"The American news is a heavy blow to us as well\r\nas to the South.\" The next day he added: \"I am still sore vexed about\r\nSherman, but Chenery did his best to attenuate the mischief[1392].\"\r\n\"Attenuation\" of Northern progress in arms was, indeed, attempted, but\r\nthe facts of the military situation were too strong for continued\r\nconcealment. From January, 1865, only the most stubborn of Southern\r\nfriends could remain blind to the approaching Northern victory. Lord\r\nActon, a hero-worshipper of the great Confederate military leader,\r\n\"broke his heart over the surrender of Lee,\" but was moved also by keen\r\ninsight as to the political meaning of that surrender[1393].\r\n\r\nSo assured were all parties in England that the great Civil War in\r\nAmerica was closing in Northern victory that the final event was\r\ndiscounted in advance and the lines were rapidly being formed for an\r\nEnglish political struggle on the great issue heralded as involved in\r\nthe American conflict. Again, on the introduction of a motion in\r\nParliament for expansion of the franchise the ultra-Conservatives\r\nattempted to read a \"lesson\" from America. The _Quarterly_ for April,\r\n1865, asserted that even yet \"the mass of educated men in England retain\r\nthe sympathy for the South which they have nourished ever since the\r\nconflict assumed a decided shape.\" America was plainly headed in the\r\ndirection of a military despotism. Her example should warn England from\r\na move in the same direction. \"The classes which govern this country are\r\nin a minority,\" and should beware of majority rule. But events\r\ndiscredited the prophecy of a military despotism. The assassination of\r\nLincoln gave opportunity not merely for a general outpouring of\r\nexpressions of sympathy but also to the Radicals a chance to exalt\r\nLincoln's leadership in democracy[1394].\r\n\r\nIn July Great Britain was holding elections for a new Parliament. Not a\r\nsingle member who had supported the cause of the North failed of\r\nre-election, several additional Northern \"friends\" were chosen, and some\r\noutspoken members for the South were defeated. Adams thought this a\r\nmatter deserving special notice in America, and prophesied a new era\r\napproaching in England:\r\n\r\n     \"As it is, I cannot resist the belief that this period marks\r\n     an era in the political movement of Great Britain. Pure\r\n     old-fashioned conservatism has so far lost its hold on the\r\n     confidence of the country that it will not appear in that\r\n     guise any more. Unless some new and foreign element should\r\n     interpose, I look for decided progress in enlarging the\r\n     popular features of the constitution, and diminishing the\r\n     influence of the aristocracy.... It is impossible not to\r\n     perceive traces of the influence of our institutions upon all\r\n     these changes.... The progress of the liberal cause, not in\r\n     England alone, but all over the world, is, in a measure, in\r\n     our hands[1395].\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Liberal progress\" was more rapid, even, than Adams anticipated.\r\nPalmerston, ill for some months past, died on October 18, 1865. Russell\r\nsucceeded him as head of the Ministry, and almost immediately declared\r\nhimself in favour of Parliamentary reform even though a majority in both\r\nHouses was still opposed to such a measure. Russell's desertion of his\r\nearlier attitude of \"finality\" on franchise expansion correctly\r\nrepresented the acceptance, though unwillingly, by both political\r\nparties of the necessity of reform. The battle, long waged, but reaching\r\nits decisive moment during the American Civil War, had finally gone\r\nagainst Conservatism when Lee surrendered at Appomatox. Russell's\r\nReform Bill of 1866 was defeated by Tory opposition in combination with\r\na small Whig faction which refused to desert the \"principle\" of\r\naristocratic government--the \"government by the wise,\" but the Tories\r\nwho came into power under Derby were forced by the popular demand voiced\r\neven to the point of rioting, themselves to present a Reform Bill.\r\nDisraeli's measure, introduced with a number of \"fancy franchises,\"\r\nwhich, in effect, sought to counteract the giving of the vote to British\r\nworking-men, was quickly subjected to such caustic criticism that all\r\nthe planned advantages to Conservatism were soon thrown overboard, and a\r\nBill presented so Radical as to permit a transfer of political power to\r\nthe working classes[1396]. The Reform Bill of 1867 changed Great Britain\r\nfrom a government by aristocracy to one by democracy. A new nation came\r\ninto being. The friends of the North had triumphed.\r\n\r\nThus in addition to the play of diplomatic incidents, the incidental\r\nfrictions, the effect on trade relations, the applications of British\r\nneutrality, and the general policy of the Government, there existed for\r\nGreat Britain a great issue in the outcome of the Civil War--the issue\r\nof the adoption of democratic institutions. It affected at every turn\r\nBritish public attitude, creating an intensity and bitterness of tone,\r\non both sides, unexampled in the expressions of a neutral people. In\r\nAmerica this was little understood, and American writers both during the\r\nwar and long afterwards, gave little attention to it[1397]. Immediately\r\nupon the conclusion of the war, Goldwin Smith, whose words during the\r\nconflict were bitter toward the aristocracy, declared that \"the\r\nterritorial aristocracy of this country and the clergy of the\r\nEstablished Church\" would have been excusable \"if they could only have\r\nsaid frankly that they desired the downfall of institutions opposed to\r\ntheir own, instead of talking about their sympathy for the weak, and\r\ntheir respect for national independence, and their anxiety for the\r\ntriumph of Free Trade[1398].\" This was stated before the democratic hope\r\nin England had been realized. Three years later the same staunch friend\r\nof the North, now removed to America and occupying a chair of history at\r\nCornell University, wrote of the British aristocracy in excuse of their\r\nattitude: \"I fought these men hard; I believed, and believe now, that\r\ntheir defeat was essential to the progress of civilization. But I\r\ndaresay we should have done pretty much as they did, if we had been born\r\nmembers of a privileged order, instead of being brought up under the\r\nblessed influence of equality and justice[1399].\"\r\n\r\nSuch judgment and such excuses will appear to the historian as\r\nwell-founded. But to Americans who conceived the Civil War as one fought\r\nfirst of all for the preservation of the nation, the issue of democracy\r\nin England seemed of little moment and little to excuse either the \"cold\r\nneutrality\" of the Government or the tone of the press. To Americans\r\nGreat Britain appeared friendly to the dissolution of the Union and the\r\ndestruction of a rival power. Nationality was the issue for the North;\r\nthat democracy was an issue in America was denied, nor could it, in the\r\nintensity of the conflict, be conceived as the vital question\r\ndetermining British attitude. The Reform Bill of 1867 brought a new\r\nBritish nation into existence, the nation decrying American institutions\r\nwas dead and a \"sister democracy\" holding out hands to the United\r\nStates had replaced it, but to this the men who had won the war for the\r\nNorth long remained blind. Not during the generation when Americans,\r\nimmersed in a life and death struggle for national existence, felt that\r\n\"he who is not for me is against me,\" could the generally correct\r\nneutrality of the British Government and the whole-hearted support of\r\nRadical England be accepted at their true value to the North. For nearly\r\nhalf a century after the American Civil War the natural sentiments of\r\nfriendship, based upon ties of blood and a common heritage of literature\r\nand history and law, were distorted by bitter and exaggerated\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1323: See my article, \"The Point of View of the British\r\nTraveller in America,\" _Pol.
