We learned, with more or less trouble and edification,\r\nthe names of countries, towns, etc., by rote; but our teacher did not\r\nask us who gave the names to these places, nor were we expected to\r\ninquire or to know if there was any connection between their names\r\nand their histories. Things are changed now; and I believe the first\r\nstimulus to an awakening interest in Geographical Etymology was given\r\nby the publication of the Rev. Isaac Taylor’s popular work, _Words\r\nand Places_. About ten years ago, I found that the best teachers in\r\nthe English schools of Edinburgh did ask questions on this subject,\r\nand I discovered, at the same time, that a book specially bearing\r\nupon it was a desideratum in school literature. As no one better\r\nqualified came forward, I was induced to make the attempt; and I hope\r\nthe following pages, the result of much research and in the face of no\r\nsmall discouragement, may prove useful to teachers, as well as to their\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nThe Index at the end of the volume, although it contains many names not\r\nincluded in the body of the work, does by no means include all that I\r\nhave given there. This did not seem necessary, because, the root words\r\nbeing alphabetically arranged, an intelligent teacher or pupil will\r\neasily find the key to the explanation of any special name by referring\r\nto the head under which it is naturally classed. I must, however,\r\npremise that, with regard to names derived from the Celtic languages,\r\nthe root word is generally placed at the beginning of the name--that\r\nis, if it contain more than one syllable. This is the case with such\r\nvocables as _pen_, _ben_, _dun_, _lis_, _rath_, _strath_, etc.; _e.g._\r\nLismore, Benmore, Dungarvan, Strath-Allan. On the other hand, in names\r\nderived from the Teutonic or Scandinavian languages, the root word\r\ncomes last, as will be found with regard to _ton_, _dale_, _burg_,\r\n_berg_, _stadt_, _dorf_, _ford_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe index, therefore, may be expected to include principally such names\r\nas, either through corruption or abbreviation, have materially changed\r\ntheir form, such as are formed from the simple root, like Fürth, Ennis,\r\nDelft, or such as contain more than one, as in Portrush, it being\r\nuncertain under which head I may have placed such names. Along with the\r\nroot words, called by the Germans _Grundwörter_, I have given a number\r\nof defining words (_Bestimmungswörter_)--such adjectives as express\r\nvariety in colour, form, size, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that many names have necessarily been omitted\r\nfrom ignorance or uncertainty with regard to their derivation. This\r\nis the case, unfortunately, with several well-known and important\r\ntowns--Glasgow, Berlin, Berne, Madrid, Paisley, etc. With regard to\r\nthese and many others, I shall be glad to receive reliable information.\r\n\r\nAnd now it only remains for me to express my obligations to the\r\ngentlemen who have kindly assisted me in this work, premising that,\r\nin the departments which they have revised, the credit of success is\r\ndue mainly to them; while I reserve to myself any blame which may be\r\ndeservedly attached to failures or omissions. The Celtic portion of\r\nmy proof-sheets has been revised by Dr. Skene, the well-known Celtic\r\nscholar of this city, and by Dr. Joyce, author of _Irish Names of\r\nPlaces_. I have also to thank the Rev. Isaac Taylor, author of _Words\r\nand Places_, for the help and encouragement which he has given me\r\nfrom time to time; and Mr. Paterson, author of the _Magyars_, for\r\nvaluable information which I received from him regarding the topography\r\nof Hungary. I appreciate the assistance given me by these gentlemen\r\nthe more, that it did not proceed from personal friendship, as I was\r\nan entire stranger to all of them. It was the kindness and courtesy\r\nof the stronger and more learned to one weaker and less gifted than\r\nthemselves; and I beg they may receive my grateful thanks, along with\r\nthe little volume which has been so much their debtor.\r\n\r\n                                                              C. B.\r\n\r\n   EDINBURGH, _July 1887_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the branches of human speculation that, in recent times, have\r\nwalked out of the misty realm of conjecture into the firm land of\r\nscience, and from the silent chamber of the student into the breezy\r\nfields of public life, there are few more interesting than Etymology.\r\nFor as words are the common counters, or coins rather, with which we\r\nmark our points in all the business and all the sport of life, any man\r\nwhose curiosity has not been blunted by familiarity, will naturally\r\nfind a pleasure in understanding what the image and superscription on\r\nthese markers mean; and amongst words there are none that so powerfully\r\nstimulate this curiosity as the names of persons and places. About\r\nthese the intelligent interest of young persons is often prominently\r\nmanifested; and it is a sad thing when parents or teachers, who should\r\nbe in a position to gratify this interest, are obliged to waive an\r\neager intelligence aside, and by repeated negations to repel the\r\ncuriosity which they ought to have encouraged. Geography indeed,\r\na subject full of interest to the young mind, has too often been\r\ntaught in such a way as neither to delight the imagination with vivid\r\npictures, nor to stimulate inquiry by a frequent reference to the\r\nhistory of names; and this is an evil which, if found to a certain\r\nextent in all countries, is particularly rank in Great Britain, where\r\nthe language of the country is composed of fragments of half a dozen\r\nlanguages, which only the learned understand, and which, to the ear of\r\nthe many, have no more significance than if they were Hebrew or Coptic.\r\nThe composite structure of our English speech, in fact, tends to\r\nconceal from us the natural organism of language; so that in our case,\r\nit requires a special training to make us fully aware of the great\r\ntruth announced by Horne Tooke, that “in language there is nothing\r\narbitrary.” Nevertheless, the curiosity about the meaning of words,\r\nthough seldom cherished, is not easily extinguished; and, in this age\r\nof locomotion, there are few scraps of information more grateful to\r\nthe intelligent tourist than those which relate to the significance of\r\ntopographical names. When, for instance, the London holiday-maker, in\r\nhis trip to the West Highlands, setting foot in one of Mr. Hutchinson’s\r\nsteamboats at Oban, on his way to the historic horrors of Glencoe,\r\nfinds on his larboard side a long, low island, green and treeless,\r\ncalled _Lismore_, he will be pleased, no doubt, at first by simply\r\nhearing so euphonious a word in a language that he had been taught\r\nto believe was harsh and barbarous, but will be transported into an\r\naltogether different region of intelligent delight when he is made to\r\nunderstand that this island is wholly composed of a vein of limestone,\r\nfound only here in the midst of a wide granitic region skirted with\r\ntrap; that, by virtue of this limestone, the island, though treeless,\r\nis more fertile than the surrounding districts; and that for this\r\nreason it has received the Celtic designation of _Liosmor_, or the\r\n_great garden_. Connected with this etymology, not only is the\r\ntopographical name made to speak reasonably to a reasonable being, but\r\nit contains in its bosom a geological fact, and an œconomical issue,\r\nbound together by a bond of association the most natural and the most\r\npermanent. The pleasant nature of the intelligence thus awakened leads\r\nus naturally to lament that, except to those who are born in Celtic\r\ndistricts and speak the Celtic language, the significance of so many of\r\nour most common topographical names in the most interesting districts\r\nis practically lost; and it deserves consideration whether, in our\r\nEnglish and classical schools, so much at least of the original speech\r\nof the country should not be taught as would enable the intelligent\r\nstudent to know the meaning of the local names, to whose parrot-like\r\nrepetition he must otherwise be condemned.\r\n\r\nSome of the Celtic words habitually used in the designation of\r\nplaces--such as _Ben_, _Glen_, _Strath_, and _Loch_--have been\r\nincorporated into the common English tongue; and the addition to this\r\nstock is not very large, which would enable an intelligent traveller\r\nto hang the points of his picturesque tour on a philological peg\r\nthat would most materially insure both their distinctness and their\r\npermanence. Nay, more; the germ of appreciation thus begotten might\r\nlead a sympathetic nature easily into some more serious occupation with\r\nthe old language of our country; and this might lead to a discovery\r\nfull of pleasant surprise, that in the domain of words, as of physical\r\ngrowth, the brown moors, when examined, often produce flowers of the\r\nmost choice beauty with which the flush of the most cultivated gardens\r\ncannot compete, and that a venerable branch of the old Indo-European\r\nfamily of languages, generally ignored as rude and unlettered, is rich\r\nin a popular poetry, as fervid in passion, and as healthy in hue, as\r\nanything that Homer or Hesiod ever sang.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of etymology, as everybody now knows, before Bopp\r\nand Grimm, and other great scholars, laid the sure foundation of\r\ncomparative philology on the principles of a philosophy, as all\r\ntrue philosophy is, at once inductive and deductive, the license of\r\nconjecture played a mad part--a part, it is only too evident, not yet\r\nfully played out--and specially raised such a glamour of illusion\r\nabout topographical etymology, that the theme became disgusting to all\r\nsober-minded thinkers, or ludicrous, as the humour might be. We must,\r\ntherefore, approach this subject with a more than common degree of\r\ncaution, anxious rather to be instructed in what is solid, than to be\r\namazed with what is ingenious. It shall be our endeavour to proceed\r\nstep by step in this matter--patiently, as with the knowledge that our\r\nfoot is on the brink of boggy ground, starting from obvious principles\r\ngiven by the constitution of the human mind, and confirmed by a large\r\ninduction of unquestioned facts.\r\n\r\nThe most natural and obvious reason for naming a place so-and-so\r\nwould be to express the nature of the situation by its most striking\r\nfeatures, with the double view of impressing its character on the\r\nmemory, and conveying to persons who had not seen it an idea of its\r\npeculiarity; _i.e._ the most obvious and natural topographical names\r\nare such as contain condensed descriptions or rude verbal pictures of\r\nthe object. Thus the notion of the highest mountain in a district may\r\nbe broadly conveyed by simply calling it the _big mount_, or, according\r\nto the order of words current in the Celtic languages, _mount big_;\r\nwhich is exactly what we find in BENMORE, from _mor_, big, the name\r\nof several of the highest mountains in the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nspecially of one in the south of Perthshire, near Killin, of another\r\nin Mull, the highest trap mountain in Scotland, and a third in Assynt.\r\nAgain, to mark the very prominent feature of mountains elevated\r\nconsiderably above the normal height, that they are covered with snow\r\nall the year round, we find LEBANON, in the north of Palestine, named\r\nfrom the Hebrew _leban_, white; MONT BLANC, in Switzerland, in the same\r\nway from an old Teutonic word signifying the same thing, which found\r\nits way into Italian and the other Romanesque languages, fairly ousting\r\nthe Latin _albus_; OLYMPUS, from the Greek λάμπομαι, to shine; the\r\nSCHNEEKOPPE, in Silesia, from _schnee_, snow, and _koppe_, what we call\r\n_kip_ in the Lowland topography of Scotland, _i.e._ a pointed hill, the\r\nsame radically as the Latin _caput_, the head. In the same fashion one\r\nof the modern names of the ancient Mount Hermon is _Jebel-eth-Thelj_,\r\nthe snowy mountain, just as the Himalayas receive their names from the\r\nSanscrit _haima_ = Greek χεîμα, winter.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious characteristic of any place, whether mountain or plain\r\nor valley, would be its shape and size, its relative situation high or\r\nlow, behind or in the front, its colour, the kind of rock or soil of\r\nwhich it is composed, the climate which it enjoys, the vegetation in\r\nwhich it abounds, and the animals by which it is frequented. Let us\r\ntake a few familiar examples of each of these cases; and, if we deal\r\nmore largely in illustrations from the Scottish Highlands than from\r\nother parts of the world, it is for three sufficient reasons--because\r\nthese regions are annually visited by the greatest number of tourists;\r\nbecause, from the general neglect of the Celtic languages, they stand\r\nmost in need of interpretation; and because they are most familiar--not\r\nfrom book-knowledge only, but by actual inspection--to the present\r\nwriter. In the matter of size, the tourist will find at GLENELG (from\r\n_sealg_, to hunt), in Inverness-shire, opposite Skye, where there are\r\ntwo well-preserved circular forts, the twin designations of GLENMORE\r\nand GLENBEG; that is, Glenbig and Glenlittle--a contrast constantly\r\noccurring in the Highlands; the word _beag_, pronounced vulgarly in\r\nArgyleshire _peek_, signifying little, evidently the same as μικ in\r\nthe Greek μικρός. As to relative situation, the root _ard_, in Latin\r\n_arduus_, frequently occurs; not, however, to express any very high\r\nmountain, but either a bluff fronting the sea, as in ARDNAMORCHUAN\r\n(the rise of the great ocean, _cuan_, perhaps from ὼκεανός), or more\r\nfrequently a slight elevation on the shore of a lake, what they call\r\nin England a _rise_, as in ARDLUI, near the head of Loch Lomond,\r\nARDVOIRLICH, and many others. The word _lui_, Gaelic _laogh_--the _gh_\r\nbeing silent, as in the English _sigh_--signifies a calf or a fawn, and\r\ngives name to the lofty mountain which the tourist sees on his right\r\nhand as he winds up where the railway is now being constructed from\r\nDalmally to Tyndrum. Another frequent root to mark relative situation\r\nis CUL, _behind_, Latin _culus_, French _cul_, a word which gives\r\nname to a whole parish in Aberdeenshire, to the famous historical\r\nsite of Culross, the reputed birthplace of St. Kentigern, and many\r\nothers. This word means simply _behind the headland_, as does also\r\nCULCHENZIE (from _ceann_, the head), at the entrance to Loch Leven and\r\nGlencoe, which the tourist looks on with interest, as for two years\r\nthe summer residence of the noble-minded Celtic evangelist Dr. Norman\r\nMacleod. But the most common root, marking relative situation, which\r\nthe wanderer through Celtic countries encounters is _inver_, meaning\r\nbelow, or the bottom of a stream, of which _aber_ is only a syncopated\r\nform, a variation which, small as it appears, has given rise to large\r\ncontroversy and no small shedding of ink among bellicose antiquarians.\r\nFor it required only a superficial glance to observe that while _Abers_\r\nare scattered freely over Wales, they appear scantly in Scotland, and\r\nthere with special prevalence only in the east and south-east of the\r\nGrampians--as in ABERDEEN, ABERDOUR, ABERLEMNO in Fife, and others. On\r\nthis the eager genius of archæological discovery, ever ready to poise\r\na pyramid on its apex, forthwith raised the theory, that the district\r\nof Scotland where the _Abers_ prevailed had been originally peopled by\r\nCelts of the Cymric or Welsh type, while the region of _Invers_ marked\r\nout the ancient seats of the pure Caledonian Celts. But this theory,\r\nwhich gave great offence to some fervid Highlanders, so far as it stood\r\non this argument, fell to the ground the moment that some more cool\r\nobserver put his finger on half a dozen or a whole dozen of Invers, in\r\nperfect agreement hobnobbing with the Abers, not far south of Aberdeen;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, a zealous Highland colonel, now departed to a\r\nmore peaceful sphere, pointed out several Abers straggling far west and\r\nnorth-west into the region of the Caledonian Canal and beyond it. But\r\nthese slippery points are wisely avoided; and there can be no doubt, on\r\nthe general principle, that relative situation has everywhere played\r\na prominent part in the terminology of districts. Northumberland and\r\nSutherland, and Cape DEAS or Cape South, in Cantire, are familiar\r\nillustrations of this principle of nomenclature. In such cases the\r\nname, of course, always indicates by what parties it was imposed;\r\nSutherland, or Southern-land, having received this appellation from the\r\nOrkney men, who lived to the north of the Pentland Firth.\r\n\r\nThe next element that claims mention is Colour. In this domain the most\r\nstriking contrasts are black and white. In ancient Greece, a common\r\nname for rivers was MELAS, or Black-water; one of which, that which\r\nflows into the Malaic Gulf, has translated itself into modern Greek\r\nas MAURO-NERO, μαûρο in the popular dialect having supplanted the\r\nclassical μἐλας; and νἐρο, as old, no doubt, as Nereus and the Nereids,\r\nhaving come into its pre-Homeric rights and driven out the usurping\r\nὕδωρ. In the Scottish Highlands, _dubh_, _black_ or _dark_, plays, as\r\nmight be expected, a great figure in topographical nomenclature; of\r\nthis let BENMUIC DUBH, or the _mount of the black sow_, familiar to\r\nmany a Braemar deer-stalker, serve as an example; while CAIRNGORM,\r\nthe cradle of many a golden-gleaming gem, stands with its dark blue\r\n(_gorm_) cap immediately opposite, and recalls to the classical fancy\r\nits etymological congeners in the CYANEAN rocks, so famous in early\r\nGreek fable. Of the contrasted epithet _white_, LEUCADIA (λευκός),\r\nwhere the poetess Sappho is famed to have made her erotic leap, is a\r\nfamiliar example. In the Highlands, _ban_ (fair), or _geal_ (white), is\r\nmuch less familiar in topographical nomenclature than _dubh_; BUIDHE,\r\non the other hand (yellow), corresponding to the ξανθός of the Greeks,\r\nis extremely common, as in LOCHBUIE at the south-east corner of Mull,\r\none of the few remaining scattered links of the possessions of the\r\nMacleans, once so mighty and latterly so foolish, in those parts. Among\r\nother colours, _glas_ (gray) is very common; so is _dearg_ (red), from\r\nthe colour of the rock, as in one of those splendid peaks that shoot\r\nup behind the slate quarries at the west end of Glencoe. _Breac_, also\r\n(spotted or brindled), is by no means uncommon, as in BEN VRACKIE,\r\nprominent behind Pitlochrie, in Perthshire, in which word the initial\r\n_b_ has been softened into a _v_ by the law of aspiration peculiar to\r\nthe Celtic languages.\r\n\r\nThere remain the two points of climate and vegetation, of which a\r\nfew examples will suffice. In Sicily, the town of SELINUS, whose\r\nmagnificence remains preserved in indelible traces upon the soil,\r\ntook its name from the wild parsley, σἐλινον, which grew plentifully\r\non the ground, and which appears on the coins of the city. In the\r\nScottish Highlands, no local name is more common than that which is\r\nfamiliarly known as the designation of one of the most genuine of the\r\nold Celtic chiefs, the head of the clan Macpherson--we mean the word\r\nCLUNY (Gaelic _cluain_; possibly only a variety of _grün_, green),\r\nwhich signifies simply a green meadow, a vision often very delightful\r\nto a pedestrian after a long day’s tramp across brown brae and gray\r\nfell in those parts. The abundance of oak in ancient Celtic regions,\r\nwhere it is not so common now, is indicated by the frequency of the\r\ntermination _darach_ (from which DERRY, in Ireland, is corrupted;\r\nGreek δρûς and δόρυ, as in the designation of one of the Campbells in\r\nArgyle, AUCHIN-DARROCH, _i.e._ oak-field. The pine, _giubhas_, appears\r\nin KINGUSSIE, pine-end, in the midst of that breezy open space which\r\nspreads out to the north-west of the Braemar Grampians. In BEITH and\r\nAULTBEA (birch-brook) we have _beath_, Latin _betula_, a birch-tree;\r\nelm and ash are rare; heather, _fraoch_, especially in the designation\r\nof islands, as EILEANFRAOCH, in Loch Awe, and another in the Sound\r\nof Kerrera, close by Oban. Of climate we find traces in AUCHNASHEEN\r\n(_sian_), on the open blasty road between Dingwall and Janetown,\r\nsignifying the field of wind and rain; in MEALFOURVONIE, the broad\r\nhill of the frosty moor, composed of the three roots _maol_ (broad and\r\nbald), _fuar_ (cold), and _mhonaid_ (upland); in BALFOUR (cold town),\r\nand in the remarkable mountain in Assynt called CANISP, which appears\r\nto be a corruption of _Ceann-uisge_, or Rainy-head.\r\n\r\nLastly, of animals: _madadh_, a fox, appears in LOCHMADDY and ARDMADDY;\r\n_coin_, of a dog, in ACHNACHOIN, or Dog’s-field, one of the three\r\nbloody spots that mark the butchery of the false Campbell in Glencoe;\r\nand, throwing our glance back two thousand years, in CYNOSCEPHALÆ, or\r\nthe Dog’s-head, in Thessaly, where the sturdy Macedonian power at last\r\nbowed in submission before the proud swoop of the Roman eagles; the\r\nfamiliar cow (_baa_, Lat. _bos_) gives its name to that fair loch,\r\nwhich sleeps so quietly in the bosom of beautiful Mull; while the goat,\r\nfamous also in the sad history of Athenian decline at AIGOSPOTAMI,\r\nor the Goat’s-river, gives its name to the steepy heights of ARDGOUR\r\n(from _gobhar_, Lat. _caper_), a fragment of the old inheritance of\r\nthe Macleans, which rise up before the traveller so majestically as he\r\nsteams northward from Ballachulish to Fort William and Banavie.\r\n\r\nIn a country composed almost entirely of mountain ridges, with\r\nintervening hollows of various kinds, it is only natural that the\r\nvariety in the scenery, produced by the various slopes and aspects of\r\nthe elevated ground, should give rise to a descriptive nomenclature of\r\ncorresponding variety. This is especially remarkable in Gaelic; and the\r\ntourist in the Scottish Highlands will not travel far without meeting,\r\nin addition to the _Ben_ and _Ard_ already mentioned, the\r\nfollowing specific designations:--\r\n\r\n    _Drum_--a ridge.\r\n    _Scour_--a jagged ridge or peak.\r\n    _Cruach_--a conical mountain.\r\n    _Mam_--a slowly rising hill.\r\n    _Maol_--a broad, flat, bald mountain.\r\n    _Monagh_--an upland moor.\r\n    _Tulloch_ or _Tilly_--a little hill, a knoll.\r\n    _Tom_--a hillock, a mound.\r\n    _Tor_--a hillock, a mound.\r\n    _Bruach_--a steep slope (Scotch brae).\r\n    _Craig_--crag, cliff.\r\n    _Cairn_--a heap of stones.\r\n    _Lairg_--a broad, low slope.\r\n    _Letter_--the side of a hill near the water.\r\n    _Croit_--a hump.\r\n    _Clach_--a stone.\r\n    _Lech_--a flagstone.\r\n\r\nIn the Lowlands, _pen_, _law_, _fell_, _bræ_, _hope_, _rise_, _edge_,\r\nindicate similar varieties. Among these _pen_, as distinguished from\r\nthe northern _ben_, evidently points to a Welsh original. _Hope_ is a\r\ncurious word, which a south-country gentleman once defined to me as\r\n“the point of the low land mounting the hill whence the top can be\r\nseen.” Of course, if this be true, it means an elevation not very far\r\nremoved from the level ground, because, as every hill-climber knows,\r\nthe top of a huge eminence ceases to be visible the moment you get\r\nbeyond what the Greeks call the “fore-feet” of the mountain.\r\n\r\nIn the designation of the intervening hollows, or low land, the variety\r\nof expression is naturally less striking. _Glen_ serves for almost all\r\nvarieties of a narrow Highland valley. A very narrow rent or fissured\r\ngorge is called a _glachd_. The English word _dale_, in Gaelic _dail_,\r\nmeans in that language simply a field, or flat stretch of land at the\r\nbottom of the hills. It is to be noted, however, that this word is both\r\nCeltic and Teutonic; but, in topographical etymology, with a difference\r\ndistinctly indicative of a twofold origin. In an inland locality where\r\nthe Scandinavians never penetrated, _Dal_ is always prefixed to the\r\nother element of the designation, as in DALWHINNIE, DALNACARDOCH, and\r\nDALNASPIDAL, the field of meeting, the field of the smithy, and the\r\nfield of the hospital, all in succession within a short distance on\r\nthe road between the Spey uplands and Blair Athol. On the other hand,\r\na postfixed _dale_, as in BORROWDALE, EASDALE, and not a few others,\r\nindicates a Saxon or Norse origin. The word _den_ or _dean_, as in the\r\nDEAN BRIDGE, Edinburgh, and the DEN BURN, Aberdeen, is Anglo-Saxon\r\n_denn_, and appears in the English TENTERDEN, and some others. Another\r\nCeltic name for field is _ach_, the Latin _ag-er_, which appears in\r\na number of Highland places, as in ACH-NA-CLOICHE (stone field),\r\nin Argyleshire. A hollow surrounded by mountains is called by the\r\nwell-known name of LAGGAN, which is properly a diminutive from _lag_,\r\nin Greek λάκκος, in Latin _lacus_, a hollow filled with water, and\r\nin German a mere _loch_, or hole, into which a mouse might creep. A\r\nspecial kind of hollow, lying between the outstretched arms of a big\r\nBen, and opening at one end into the vale below, is called in Gaelic\r\n_coire_, literally a cauldron--a word which the genius of Walter Scott\r\nhas made a permanent possession of the English language. In England\r\nsuch mountain hollows are often denominated _combs_, as in ADDISCOMBE,\r\nASHCOMB, a venerable old British word of uncorrupted Cornish descent,\r\nand which, so far as I know, does not appear in Scottish topography,\r\nunless it be in CUMMERTREES (on the shore, _traigh_), near Annan, and\r\nCUMBERNAULD; but this I am not able to verify by local knowledge. The\r\nword _cumar_ appears in O’Reilly’s Irish dictionary as “the bed of\r\na large river or a narrow sea, a hollow generally,” but seems quite\r\nobsolete in the spoken Gaelic of to-day. The termination _holm_ is\r\nwell-known both in English and Scotch names, and proclaims itself as\r\ncharacteristically Scandinavian, in the beautiful metropolis of the\r\nSwedes. In Gaelic districts a holm, that is, a low watery meadow, is\r\ngenerally called a _lon_, a word which has retained its place in Scotch\r\nas _loan_--LOANING, LOANHEAD, LOANEND, and is fundamentally identical\r\nwith the English _lane_ and _lawn_. The varieties of sea-coast are\r\nexpressed by the words _traigh_, _cladach_, _camus_, _corran_, _wick_,\r\n_loch_, _rutha_, _ross_, _caolas_, _stron_, _salen_, among which, in\r\npassing, we may specially note _camus_, from the root _cam_, Greek\r\nκάμπτω, to bend: hence MORECAMBE BAY, near Lancaster, signifies the\r\ngreat bend; _corran_, a scythe, evidently allied to the Latin _curvus_,\r\nand used in the Highlands to denote any crescent-shaped shore, as at\r\nCorranferry, Ardgour, in Lochfinne; _wick_, a familiar Scandinavian\r\nword signifying a bay, and which, with the Gaelic article prefixed,\r\nseems to have blundered itself into NIGG at Aberdeen, and near Fearn\r\nin Ross-shire; _caolas_, a strait, combining etymologically the very\r\ndistant and very different localities of CALAIS and BALLACHULISH;\r\n_stron_ or _sron_, a nose, which lends its name to a parish near the\r\nend of Loch Sunart, in Morvern, and thence to a famous mineral found in\r\nits vicinity; lastly, _salen_ is nothing but salt, and appears in the\r\nsouth of Ireland and the north-west of Scotland, under the slightly\r\nvaried forms of KINSALE and KINTAIL, both of which words signify the\r\nhead of the salt water; for Irish and Gaelic are only one language\r\nwith a slightly different spelling here and there, and a sprinkling of\r\npeculiar words now and then.\r\n\r\nThe only other features of natural scenery that play a noticeable\r\npart in topographical etymology are the rivers, lakes, wells, and\r\nwaterfalls; and they need not detain us long. The Gaelic _uisge_,\r\nwater, of which the Latin _aqua_ is an abraded form, appears in the\r\nnames of Scottish rivers as _Esk_, and of Welsh rivers as _Usc_. The\r\nfamiliar English Avon is the Gaelic _amhainn_, evidently softened down\r\nby aspiration from the Latin _amnis_. This _avon_ often appears at the\r\nend of river names curtailed, as in GARONNE, the rough river, from the\r\nGaelic root _garbh_, rough. The DON, so common as a river name from the\r\nBlack Sea to Aberdeen, means either the deep river or the brown river.\r\nA small river, _brook_ in English, gives name to not a few places and\r\npersons. In the Scottish Highlands, and in those parts of the Lowlands\r\noriginally inhabited by the Celtic race, the word _alt_ performs the\r\nsame functions. _Loch_, in Gaelic, answering to the English _mere_\r\n(Latin _mare_), appears most commonly in the Highlands, as KINLOCH,\r\n_i.e._ the town or house at the head of the lake; and _tobar_, a\r\nwell, frequently, as in HOLYWELL, connected with a certain religious\r\nsanctity, appears in TOBERMORY, _i.e._ the well of the Virgin Mary, one\r\nof the most beautiful quiet bits of bay scenery in Great Britain. Of\r\nplaces named from waterfalls (_eas_, from _esk_), a significant element\r\nin Highland scenery, INVERNESS, and MONESS near Aberfeldy, are the most\r\nnotable, the one signifying “the town at the bottom of the river, which\r\nflows from the lake where there is the great waterfall,” _i.e._ FOYERS;\r\nand the other, “the waterfall of the moorish uplands,” which every one\r\nunderstands who walks up to it.\r\n\r\nSo much for the features of unappropriated nature, stereotyped, as it\r\nwere, at once and for ever, in the old names of local scenery. But as\r\ninto a landscape an artist will inoculate his sentiment and symbolise\r\nhis fancy, so on the face of the earth men are fond to stamp the\r\ntrace of their habitation and their history. Under this influence the\r\nnomenclature of topography becomes at once changed from a picture of\r\nnatural scenery to a record of human fortunes. And in this department\r\nit is plain that the less varied and striking the features of nature,\r\nthe greater the necessity of marking places by the artificial\r\ndifferentiation produced by the presence of human dwellings. Hence, in\r\nthe flat, monotonous plains of North Germany, the abundance of places\r\nending in _hausen_ and _heim_, which are only the Saxon forms of our\r\nEnglish _house_ and _home_. Of the termination _hausen_, SACHSENHAUSEN,\r\nthe home of the Saxons, and FRANKENHAUSEN, the home of the Franks, are\r\namongst the most notable examples. _Heim_ is pleasantly associated with\r\nrefreshing draughts in HOCHHEIM, _i.e._ high home, on the north bank\r\nof the Rhine a little below Mainz, whence a sharp, clear wine being\r\nimported, with the loss of the second syllable, and the transformation\r\nof _ch_ into _k_, produced the familiar hock. This _heim_ in a thousand\r\nplaces of England becomes _ham_, but in Scotland, where the Celtic\r\nelement prevails, appears only rarely in the south-east and near the\r\nEnglish border, as in COLDINGHAM and EDNAM--the birthplace of the poet\r\nThomson--contracted from Edenham. Another root very widely expressive\r\nof human habitation, under the varying forms of _beth_, _bo_, and _by_,\r\nis scattered freely from the banks of Jordan to the islands of the\r\nHebrides in the north-west of Scotland. First under this head we have\r\nthe great army of Hebrew _beths_, not a few of which are familiar to\r\nour ear from the cherished teachings of early childhood, as--BETHABARA,\r\nthe house of the ferry; BETHANY, the house of dates; BETHAVEN, the\r\nhouse of naughtiness; BETHCAR, the house of lambs; BETHDAGON, the house\r\nof the fish-god Dagon; BETHEL, the house of God; BETHSHEMESH, the house\r\nof the sun (like the Greek Heliopolis); and a score of others. _Bo_ is\r\nthe strictly Danish form of the root, at least in the dictionary, where\r\nthe verb _boe_, to dwell, also appears. Examples of this are found\r\nin SKIBO, in Ross-shire, and BUNESS, at the extreme end of Unst, the\r\nseat of the Edmonstones, a family well known in the annals of Shetland\r\nliterature; but more generally, in practice, it takes the softened form\r\nof _by_, as in hundreds of local designations in England, specially\r\nin Lincolnshire, where the Danes were for a long time at home. Near\r\nthe English border, as in LOCKERBY, this same termination appears;\r\notherwise in Scotland it is rare. In the Sclavonic towns of Mecklenburg\r\nand Prussia, it takes the form of _bus_, as in PYBUS, while in Cornish\r\nit is _bos_, which is a later form of _bod_ (German _bude_, English\r\n_booth_, Scotch _bothy_), which stands out prominently in Bodmin and\r\nother towns, not only in Cornwall, but in Wales. The termination _bus_\r\nappears likewise in not a few local designations in the island of\r\nIslay, where the Danes had many settlements. In Skye it appears as\r\n_bost_, as in SKEABOST, one of the oldest seats of the Macdonalds.\r\nThe other Saxon or Scandinavian terms frequently met with throughout\r\nEngland and in the north-east of Scotland are--_ton_, _setter_ or\r\n_ster_, _stead_, _stow_, _stoke_, _hay_, _park_, _worth_, _bury_,\r\n_thorp_, _toft_, _thwaite_. In Germany, besides _heim_ and _hausen_, as\r\nalready mentioned, we have the English _hay_, under the form _hagen_,\r\na fence; and _thorp_ under the form _dorf_, a village; and _worth_\r\nunder the forms _worth_ and _werth_, which are merely variations of\r\nthe Greek χόρτος, English yard, and the Sclavonic _gard_ and _gorod_,\r\nand the Celtic _garad_, the familiar word in the Highlands for a stone\r\nwall or dyke. In Germany, also, _weiler_, from _weilen_, to dwell, and\r\n_leben_, to live, are thickly sprinkled; _hof_, also, is extremely\r\ncommon, signifying a court or yard--a suffix which the French, in that\r\npart of Germany which they stole from the Empire, turned into _court_\r\nor _ville_, as in _Thionville_ from _Diedenhofen_.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Teutonic part of this branch of topographical\r\ndesignation. In the Highlands _tigh_ and _bail_ are the commonest\r\nwords to denote a human dwelling, the one manifestly an aspirated form\r\nof the Latin _tignum_ (Greek στἐγος, German _dach_), and the other\r\nas plainly identical with the πόλις which appears in Sebastopol, and\r\nnot a few cities, both ancient and modern, where Greek influence or\r\nGreek affectation prevailed. With regard to _bal_, it is noticeable\r\nthat in Ireland it generally takes the form of _bally_, which is the\r\nfull form of the word in Gaelic also, _baile_, there being no final\r\nmute vowels in that language; but in composition for topographical use\r\nfinal _e_ is dropped, as in BALMORAL, the majestic town or house, from\r\n_morail_, magnificent, a very apt designation for a royal residence,\r\nby whatever prophetic charm it came to be so named before her present\r\nMajesty learned the healthy habit of breathing pure Highland air amid\r\nthe fragrant birches and clear waters of Deeside. _Tigh_, though less\r\ncommon than _bal_, is not at all unfrequent in the mountains; and\r\ntourists in the West Highlands are sure to encounter two of the most\r\nnotable between Loch Lomond and Oban. The first, TYNDRUM, the house\r\non the ridge, at the point where the ascent ceases as you cross from\r\nKillin to Dalmally; and the other TAYNUILT, or the house of the brook,\r\nin Scotch burnhouse, beyond Ben Cruachan, where the road begins to wend\r\nthrough the rich old copsewood towards Oban. I remember also a curious\r\ninstance of the word _tigh_ in a local designation, half-way between\r\nInveraray and Loch Awe. In that district a little farmhouse on the\r\nright of the road is called TIGHNAFEAD, _i.e._ whistle-house (_fead_,\r\na whistle, Latin _fides_), which set my philological fancy immediately\r\non the imagination that this exposed place was so called from some\r\npeculiar whistling of the blast down from the hills immediately behind;\r\nbut such imaginations are very unsafe; for the fact turned out to be,\r\nif somewhat less poetical, certainly much more comfortable, that this\r\nhouse of call, in times within memory, stood at a greater distance\r\nfrom the road than it now does, which caused the traveller, when he\r\ncame down the descent on a cold night, sharp-set for a glass of strong\r\nwhisky, to make his presence and his wish known by a shrill whistle\r\nacross the hollow.\r\n\r\nSo much for _tigh_. The only other remark that I would make here\r\nis, that the word _clachan_, so well known from Scott’s Clachan of\r\nAberfoyle, does not properly mean a village, as Lowlanders are apt\r\nto imagine, but only a churchyard, or, by metonymy, a church--as the\r\ncommon phrase used by the natives, _Di domhnaich dol do’n chlachan_,\r\n“going to church on Sunday,” sufficiently proves--the word properly\r\nmeaning only the stones in the churchyard, which mark the resting-place\r\nof the dead; and if the word is ever used for a village, it is only by\r\ntransference to signify the village in which the parish church is, and\r\nthe parish churchyard.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the dwellings of men, but their actions, that make\r\nplaces interesting; and as the march of events in great historical\r\nmovements generally follows the march of armies, it follows that camps\r\nand battle-fields and military settlements will naturally have left\r\nstrong traces in the topography of every country where human beings\r\ndwell. And accordingly we find that the _chester_ and the _caster_,\r\nadded as a generic term to so many English towns, are simply the sites\r\nof ancient Roman _castra_ or camps; while Cologne, on the Rhine, marks\r\none of the most prosperous of their settlements in Germany. Curiously\r\nanalogous to this is the _Cöln_, a well-known quarter of Berlin, on the\r\nSpree, where the German emperors first planted a Teutonic colony in\r\nthe midst of a Sclavonic population. In the solemn march of Ossianic\r\npoetry, the word _blar_ generally signifies a field of battle; but, as\r\nthis word properly signifies only a large field or open space, we have\r\nno right to say that such names as BLAIR ATHOL and BLAIRGOWRIE have\r\nanything to do with the memory of sanguinary collisions. ALEXANDRIA,\r\nin Egypt, is one of the few remaining places of note that took their\r\nname from the brilliant Macedonian Helleniser of the East. ALEXANDRIA,\r\nin the vale of Leven, in Dumbartonshire, tells of the family of\r\nSmollett, well known in the annals of Scottish literary genius, and\r\nstill, by their residence, adding a grace to one of the most beautiful\r\ndistricts of lake scenery in the world. ADRIANOPLE stereotypes the\r\nmemory of one of the most notable of the Roman emperors, who deemed it\r\nhis privilege and pleasure to visit the extremest limits of his vast\r\ndominions, and leave some beneficial traces of his kingship there. The\r\nname PETERSBURG, whose Teutonic character it is impossible to ignore,\r\nindicates the civilisation of a Sclavonic country by an emperor whose\r\nearly training was received from a people of German blood and breed;\r\nwhile CONSTANTINOPLE recalls the momentous change which took place in\r\nthe centre of gravity of the European world, when the declining empire\r\nof the Roman Cæsars was about to become Greek in its principal site,\r\nas it had long been in its dominant culture. The streets of great\r\ncities, as one may see prominently in Paris, in their designations\r\noften contain a register of the most striking events of their national\r\nhistory. Genuine names of streets in old cities are a historical growth\r\nand an anecdotal record, which only require the pen of a cunning writer\r\nto make them as attractive as a good novel. London, in this view, is\r\nparticularly interesting; and Emerson, I recollect, in his book, _How\r\nthe Great City grew_ (London, 1862), tells an amusing story about the\r\ngreat fire in London, which certain pious persons observed to have\r\ncommenced at a street called PUDDING LANE, and ended at a place called\r\nPYE CORNER, in memory of which they caused the figure of a fat boy to\r\nbe put up at Smithfield, with the inscription on his stomach, “This\r\nboy is in memory put up for the late fire of London, occasioned by the\r\nsin of gluttony, 1666.” Many a dark and odorous close in Old Edinburgh\r\nalso, to men who, like the late Robert Chambers, could read stones\r\nwith knowing eyes, is eloquent with those tales of Celtic adventure\r\nand Saxon determination which make the history of Scotland so full\r\nof dramatic interest; while, on the other hand, the flunkeyism of\r\nthe persons who, to tickle the lowest type of aristocratic snobbery,\r\nbaptized certain streets of New Edinburgh with BUCKINGHAM Terrace,\r\nBELGRAVE Crescent, GROSVENOR Street, and such like apish mimicry of\r\nmetropolitan West Endism, stinks in the nostrils and requires no\r\ncomment. But not only to grimy streets of reeking towns, but to the\r\nbroad track of the march of the great lines of the earth’s surface,\r\nthere is attached a nomenclature which tells the history of the\r\nadventurous captain, or the courageous commander, who first redeemed\r\nthese regions from the dim limbo of the unknown, and brought them into\r\nthe distinct arena of cognisable and manageable facts. In the frosty\r\nbounds of the far North-West, the names of MACKENZIE, MACLINTOCK, and\r\nMACLURE proclaim the heroic daring that belongs so characteristically\r\nto the Celtic blood in Scotland. But it is in the moral triumphs of\r\nreligion, which works by faith in what is noble, love of what is good,\r\nand reverence for what is great, that the influence of history over\r\ntopographical nomenclature is most largely traced. In ancient Greece,\r\nthe genial piety which worshipped its fairest Avatar in the favourite\r\nsun-god Apollo, stamped its devotion on the name of APOLLONIA, on\r\nthe Ionian Sea, and other towns whose name was legion. In CORNWALL,\r\nalmost every parish is named after some saintly apostle, who, in days\r\nof savage wildness and wastefulness, had brought light and peace and\r\nhumanity into these remote regions. In the Highlands of Scotland, the\r\nKILBRIDES (_kill_ from _cella_, a shrine), KILMARTINS, KILMARNOCKS, and\r\nKILMALLIES everywhere attest the grateful piety of the forefathers of\r\nthe Celtic race in days which, if more dark, were certainly not more\r\ncold than the times in which we now live. In the Orkneys the civilising\r\ninfluence of the clergy, or, in some cases, no doubt, their love for\r\npious seclusion, is frequently marked by the PAPAS or priests’ islands.\r\nIn Germany, MUNICH or MONACUM, which shows a monk in its coat-of-arms,\r\nhas retained to the present day the zeal for sacerdotal sanctitude\r\nfrom which it took its name; and the same must be said of MUENSTER,\r\nin Westphalia (from μοναστῆρι, in modern Greek a cathedral, English\r\nminster), the metropolis of Ultramontane polity and priestly pretension\r\nin Northern Germany.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in commemorating, like coins, special historical\r\nevents, that local names act as an important adjunct to written\r\nrecords; they give likewise the clue to great ethnological facts and\r\nmovements of which written history preserves no trace. In this respect\r\ntopographical etymology presents a striking analogy to geology; for,\r\nas the science of the constitution of the earth’s crust reveals a\r\nfossilised history of life in significant succession, long antecedent\r\nto the earliest action of the human mind on the objects of terrestrial\r\nnature, so the science of language to the practised eye discloses a\r\nsuccession of races in regions where no other sign of their existence\r\nremains. If it were doubted, for instance, whether at any period the\r\nLowlands of Scotland had been possessed by a Celtic race, and asserted\r\nroundly that from the earliest times the plains had been inhabited\r\nby a people of Teutonic blood, and only the mountain district to the\r\nwest and north-west was the stronghold of the Celt, the obvious names\r\nof not a few localities in the east and south-east of Scotland would\r\npresent an impassable bar to the acceptance of any such dogma. One\r\nstriking instance of this occurs in Haddingtonshire, where a parish\r\nis now called GARAVALT--by the very same appellation as a well-known\r\nwaterfall near Braemar, in the hunting forest of the late Prince\r\nConsort; and with the same propriety in both cases, for the word\r\nin Gaelic signifies a _rough brook_, and such a brook is the most\r\nstriking characteristic of both districts. Cases of this kind clearly\r\nindicate the vanishing of an original Celtic people from districts\r\nnow essentially Teutonic both in speech and character. The presence\r\nof a great Sclavonic people in Northern Germany, and of an extensive\r\nSclavonic immigration into Greece in mediæval times, is attested with\r\nthe amplest certitude in the same way. A regular fringe of Scandinavian\r\nnames along the north and north-west coast of Scotland would, to the\r\npresent hour, attest most indubitably the fact of a Norse dominion in\r\nthose quarters operating for centuries, even had Haco and the battle\r\nof Largs been swept altogether from the record of history and from the\r\nliving tradition of the people. To every man who has been in Norway,\r\nLAXFIORD, in West Ross-shire, a stream well known to salmon-fishers,\r\ncarries this Scandinavian story on its face; and no man who has walked\r\nthe streets of Copenhagen will have any difficulty, when he sails\r\ninto the beautiful bay of Portree, in knowing the meaning of the\r\ngreat cliff called the STORR, which he sees along the coast a little\r\ntowards the north; for this means simply the great cliff, _storr_ being\r\nthe familiar Danish for great, as _mor_ is the Gaelic. Ethnological\r\nmaps may in this way be constructed exactly in the same fashion as\r\ngeological; and the sketch of one such for Great Britain the reader\r\nwill find in Mr. Taylor’s well-known work on _Names and Places_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the law of succession in these ethnological strata,\r\nas indicated by topographical nomenclature, the following three\r\npropositions may be safely laid down:--1. The names of great objects\r\nof natural scenery, particularly of mountains and rivers, will\r\ngenerally be significant in the language of the people who were\r\nthe original inhabitants of the country. 2. Names of places in the\r\nmost open and accessible districts of a country will be older than\r\nsimilar names in parts which are more difficult of access; but--3,\r\nthese very places being most exposed to foreign invasion, are apt\r\nto invite an adventurous enemy, whose settlement in the conquered\r\ncountry is generally accompanied with a partial, sometimes with a very\r\nconsiderable, change of local nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this change of population, Mr. Taylor in one place uses\r\nthe significant phrase, “The hills contain the ethnological sweepings\r\nof the plains.” Very true; but the effect of this on the ethnological\r\ncharacter of the population of the places is various, and in the\r\napplication requires much caution. It is right, for instance, to say\r\ngenerally that the Celtic language has everywhere in Europe retreated\r\nfrom the plains into the mountainous districts; but the people often\r\nstill remain where the language has retreated, as the examination of\r\nany directory in many a district of Scotland, where only English is now\r\nspoken, will largely show. In Greece, in the same way, many districts\r\npresent only Greek and Sclavonic names of places, where the population,\r\nwithin recent memory, is certainly Albanian. Inquiries of this nature\r\nalways require no less caution than learning; otherwise, as Mr. Skene\r\nobserves, what might have been, properly conducted, an all-important\r\nelement in fixing the ethnology of any country, becomes, in rash hands\r\nand with hot heads, a delusion and a snare.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the science of language, when wisely conducted, not only presents\r\nan interesting analogy to geological stratification; it sometimes goes\r\nfurther, and bears direct witness to important geological changes as\r\nconclusive as any evidence derived from the existing conformation of\r\nthe earth’s crust. How this comes to pass may easily be shown by a\r\nfew familiar examples. The words _wold_ and _weald_ originally meant\r\n_wood_ and _forest_, as the Anglo-Saxon Dictionary and the living use\r\nof the German language--_wald_--alike declare; but the wolds at present\r\nknown in Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, and other parts of England,\r\nare generally bare and treeless, and in bad weather very cheerless\r\nplaces indeed. If, then, “there is nothing arbitrary in language,”\r\nand all local names tell an historical tale, it is certain that, at\r\nthe time when those names were imposed, these same sites were part of\r\nan immense forest. The geologist, when, in the far-stretching bogs\r\neast of Glencoe, and near Kinloch Ewe, and in many other places of\r\nScotland, he calls attention to the fact of layers of gigantic trees\r\nlying now deeply embedded under the peat, adduces an argument with\r\nregard to the primitive vegetation of our part of the world not a\r\nwhit more convincing. The same fact of a lost vegetation is revealed\r\nin not a few places of England which end in the old word _hurst_,\r\nsignifying a forest. Again, there is a large family of places in and\r\nabout the Harz Mountains, in Germany, ending in _ode_, as OSTERODE,\r\nHASSELRODE, WERNINGERODE, and so forth. Now most of these places, as\r\nspecially HASSELRODE, are now remarkably free from those leagues of\r\nleafy luxuriance that give such a marked character to the scenery of\r\nthat mountain district. It is certain, however, that they were at one\r\ntime in the centre of an immense forest; for the word _rode_, radically\r\nthe same as our _rid_, and perhaps the Welsh _rhydd_, Gaelic _reidh_,\r\nsimply means “to make clear” or “clean,” and teaches that the forest in\r\nthat part had been cleared for human habitation.\r\n\r\nOnce more: it is a well-known fact in geology that the border limit\r\nbetween sea and land is constantly changing, the briny element in some\r\ncliffy places, as to the north of Hull, systematically undermining the\r\nland, and stealing away the farmer’s acreage inch by inch and foot by\r\nfoot; while in other places, from the conjoint action of river deposits\r\nand tidal currents, large tracts of what was once a sea-bottom are\r\nadded to the land. The geological proof of this is open often to the\r\nmost superficial observer; but the philological proof, when you once\r\nhold the key of it, is no less patent. In the Danish language--which\r\nis a sort of half-way house between high German and English--the word\r\n_oe_ signifies an island. This _oe_, in the shape of _ay_, _ea_, _ey_,\r\nor _y_, appears everywhere on the British coast, particularly in the\r\nWest Highlands, as in COLONSAY, TOROSAY, ORANSAY, and in ORKNEY; and if\r\nthere be any locality near the sea wearing this termination, not now\r\nsurrounded by water, the conclusion is quite certain, on philological\r\ngrounds, that it once was so. Here the London man will at once think on\r\nBERMONDSEY and CHELSEA, and he will think rightly; but he must not be\r\nhasty to draw STEPNEY under the conditions of the same category, for\r\nthe EY in that word, if I am rightly informed, is a corruption from\r\n_hithe_, a well-known Anglo-Saxon and good old English term signifying\r\na _haven_; and generally, in all questions of topographical etymology,\r\nthere is a risk of error where the old spelling of the word is not\r\nconfronted with the form which, by the attritions and abrasions of\r\ntime, it may have assumed.\r\n\r\nThese observations, which at the request of the author of the following\r\npages I have hastily set down, will be sufficient to indicate the\r\nspirit in which the study of topographical etymology ought to be\r\npursued. Of course, I have no share in the praise which belongs to the\r\nsuccessful execution of so laborious an investigation; neither, on\r\nthe other hand, can blame be attached to me for such occasional slips\r\nas the most careful writer may make in a matter where to err is easy,\r\nand where conjecture has so long been in the habit of usurping the\r\nplace of science. But I can bear the most honest witness to the large\r\nresearch, sound judgment, and conscientious accuracy of the author;\r\nand feel happy to have my name, in a subsidiary way, connected with a\r\nwork which, I am convinced, will prove an important addition to the\r\nfurniture of our popular schools.\r\n\r\n    COLLEGE, EDINBURGH,\r\n       _February 1875_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Anc.

The\r\nword, in various forms, occurs frequently in river names throughout\r\nWestern Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, and often\r\ntakes the form of _au_ or _ach_; _e.g._ the rivers Aa, Ach, Aach;\r\nSaltach (salt river); Wertach (a river with many islands)--_v._ WARID,\r\netc.; Trupach (troubled stream); Weser, _i.e._ _Wesar-aha_ (western\r\nstream); Lauter, _i.e._ _Hlauter-aha_ (clear stream); Danube or Donau,\r\n_i.e._ _Tuon-aha_ (thundering stream); Main, _i.e._ _Magin-aha_ (great\r\nstream); Fisch-aha (fish stream); Schwarza (black stream); Zwiesel-au\r\n(the stream of the whirlpool); Erlach (alder-tree stream); Gron-aha\r\n(green stream); Dachau (the clayey stream); Fulda, _i.e._ _Fold-aha_\r\n(land stream); Rod-aha (reedy stream); Saale and Saala from _salz_\r\n(salt stream). The simple _a_ or _o_, with a prefix expressive of\r\nthe character of the stream, is the most frequent form of the word\r\nin Iceland and Scandinavia, and in the districts of Great Britain\r\ncolonised by Norsemen or Danes; _e.g._ Laxa (salmon river); Hvita\r\n(white river); Brora (bridge river); Rotha (red river); Greta (weeping\r\nriver); Storaa (great river); Thurso (Thor’s river), which gives its\r\nname to the town; Lossie, anc. _Laxi-a_ (salmon river).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AB (Sansc.),\r\nAW (Pers.),]\r\n\r\nwater; _e.g._ Doab (the district of two waters); Menab (the mouth of\r\nthe water), on the Persian Gulf; Busheab or _Khoshaub_ (good water), a\r\nriver in Hindostan, also an island in the Persian Gulf; Neelab (blue\r\nwater); Punjaub (the district of the five streams); Chinab or Chenaub\r\nR., said to be a corrupt. of its former name _Chaudra Bhagee_ (the\r\ngarden of the moon), so called from a small lake of that name from\r\nwhich it proceeds. Cognate with this root is the Gadhelic _abh_, in its\r\nforms of _aw_ or _ow_. Thus in Scotland we have the River Awe and Loch\r\nAwe; in Ireland, Ow and Owbeg (little stream); Ow-nageerah (the stream\r\nof the sheep); Finnow (clear stream). Cognate with these root-words is\r\nthe Lat. _aqua_ and its derivations in the Romance languages, as well\r\nas _ae_ or _ea_ (A.S. water). Forsteman finds river names, allied to\r\nthe foregoing, throughout Germany and France, in such forms as _ap_,\r\n_op_, _ep_, etc., as in the Oppa, Lennep, Barop, Biberaffa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABAD (Pers. and Sansc.),]\r\n\r\na dwelling or town, generally connected with the name of its founder;\r\n_e.g._ Hyderabad (the town of Hyder Ali, or of the Lion); Ahmedabad\r\n(of the Sultan Ahmed); Furrackabad (founded by Furrack the Fortunate);\r\nAgra or Akberabad (founded by Akber); Nujiabad (of Nujibah-Dowlah);\r\nAuringabad (founded by Aurungzebe); Jafferabad (the city of Jaffier);\r\nJehanabad (of Shah Jehan); Jellabad (of Jellal, a chief); Moorshedabad\r\n(the town of Moorshed Khoolly-Khan); Moorabad (named after Morad, the\r\nson of Shah Jehan); Shahabad (of the Shah); Abbas-abad (founded by\r\nAbbas the Great); Dowladabad (the town of wealth); Hajiabad (of the\r\npilgrim); Meschdabad (of the mosque); Islamabad (of the true faith);\r\nAllah-abad (of God); Secunderabad (named after Alexander the Great);\r\nResoulabad (of the prophet); Asterabad (on the River Aster); Futteabad\r\n(the town of victory); Sadabad or Suffi-abad (the town of the _sadi_ or\r\n_suffi_, _i.e._ the sage).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABER (Cym.-Cel.),\r\nABHIR and OBAIR (Gael.),]\r\n\r\na confluence of waters; applied, in topography, to places at the conf.\r\nof streams, or at the embouchure of a river. The derivation of the\r\nterm has been traced by some etymologists to the conjunction of _ath_\r\n(Gael.), a ford, and _bior_, water; by others to Cym.-Cel. _at_ (at)\r\nand _bior_ (water). This prefix is general in many of the counties\r\nof Scotland, throughout Wales, and, in a few instances, in Ireland,\r\nalthough in the latter country the synonyms _inver_ and _cumar_ are\r\nmore frequent. Both words are found in the topography of the Picts,\r\nbut the Scots of Argyleshire used only _inver_ before they came from\r\nIreland to settle in that district. The word _aber_ seems to have\r\nbecome obsolete among them; and as there are no _abers_ in Ayrshire,\r\nRenfrew, and Lanarkshire, the word had probably become obsolete before\r\nthe kingdom of Strathclyde was formed. Dr. Joyce, in his _Irish Names\r\nof Places_, traces its use as prefix or affix to the Irish root _abar_\r\n(a mire), as in the little stream Abberachrinn (_i.e._ the river of\r\nthe miry place of the tree). In Wales we find Aberconway, Aberfraw,\r\nAberistwyth, Aberavon, Aberayron, Aberdare, Aberdaron, Abergavenny, at\r\nthe embouchure of the _Conway_, _Fraw_, _Istwyth_, _Avon_, _Aeron_,\r\n_Dar_, _Daron_, _Gavenny_. Barmouth, corrupt. from Aber-Mowddy, a\r\nseaport in Merioneth, at the mouth of the R. Mowddy. Berriew, corrupt.\r\nfrom Aber-Rhiw (at the junction of the R. Rhiw with the Severn);\r\nAberdaugledden, the Welsh name for Haverford-west, at the mouth of twin\r\nrivers resembling two swords (_gledden_), which unite at Milford Haven.\r\nIt is called by the Welsh now Hwlford (the sailing road) because the\r\ntide comes up to the town. Aberhonddu, at the mouth of the R. Honddi or\r\nHonddu (the county town of Brecknock), and Aberdovey, at the embouchure\r\nof the R. Dovey in Wales. In Scotland, Aberbrothwick or Arbroath,\r\nAbercorn, anc. _Aeber-curnig_, Aberdour, Abergeldie, Abernethy, at the\r\nembouchure of the _Brothock_, _Cornie_, _Dour_, _Geldie_, and _Nethy_.\r\nAberchirder is _Abhir-chiar-dur_ (the conf. of the dark water);\r\nAbercrombie (the curved conf.); Aberfeldy, _i.e._ _Abhir-feathaile_\r\n(the smooth conf.); Aberfoyle (the conf. of the pool, _phuill_);\r\nAberlemno (the conf. of the leaping water, _leumnach_); Arbirlot,\r\nanc. _Aber-Elliot_ (at the mouth of the Elliot); Applecross for\r\n_Abhir-croisan_ (the conf. of trouble); Old Aberdeen and New Aberdeen,\r\nat the mouths of the Don and Dee, Lat. _Devana-castra_; Fochabers (the\r\n_plain_, at the river mouth), Gael. _faigh_, a plain; Lochaber (at the\r\nmouth of the loch); Barmouth, in Wales, corrupt, of _Aber-Mawdoch_ or\r\n_Maw_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABI (Turc.),]\r\n\r\na river; _e.g._ Abi-shiran (sweet river); Abi-shur (salt river);\r\nAbi-gurm (warm river); Abi-gard (yellow river); Abi-kuren (the river of\r\nCyrus); Ab-Allah (God’s river).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABT (Teut.), an abbot, Lat. _abbatis_.\r\nABIE, an abbey.]\r\n\r\nThese and similar words, in the Romance languages, derived from the\r\nHeb. _abba_ (father), were introduced into the languages of Europe in\r\nconnection with the monastic system, and are attached to the names of\r\nplaces founded for monks, or belonging to church lands. Thus--Absberg\r\n(abbot’s hill); Apersdorf, for _Abbatesdorf_ (abbot’s village); Absholz\r\n(abbot’s wood); Abtsroda (abbot’s clearing), in Germany; Appenzell,\r\nanc. _Abbatiscella_ (abbot’s church), founded by the Abbot of St.\r\nGall, A.D. 647; Abbeville (abbot’s dwelling), in France; Abbotsbury\r\n(the abbot’s fortified place), Dorset; Abbeydare (the abbey on the\r\nR.

When, however, _foyle_\r\ncomes in as a termination, it is commonly derived from _poll_ (a hole),\r\nas in Ballyfoyle and Ballyfoile (the town of the hole). The anc. name\r\nof Britain, _Albion_, has sometimes been traced to this root, but more\r\ngenerally to the _white_ cliffs (Lat. _albus_) on the coast of Kent, as\r\nseen first by the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALR (A.S.),\r\nALNUS (Lat.),\r\nAUNE (Fr.),]\r\n\r\nthe alder-tree; _e.g._ Alr-holt, Aldershot (alder-tree wood);\r\nAlresford (Alderford); Alrewas (alder-tree pasture); Alderley\r\n(alder-tree meadow), in England; Aulney, Aulnoy, Aulnois, Aunay, Auneau\r\n(alder grove), in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALT (Gadhelic),]\r\n\r\na stream; _e.g._ the Alt, Aldan, Alta (river names); Alt-dowran (otter\r\nstream); Aultsigh (gliding stream); Alt-na-guish (the stream of the\r\nfir-trees); Aldivalloch, _i.e._ _Allt-a-bhealaich_ (the stream of\r\nthe pass); Alness, _i.e._ _Allt-an-casa_ (of the cascade); Alltmore\r\n(great stream); Auldearn, _i.e._ _Allt-fearn_ (alder-tree stream);\r\nCumbernauld, corrupt. from _Cumar-nan-alta_ (the confluence of the\r\nstreams); Garavault in Aberdeenshire, Garvault in East Lothian, and\r\nGarvald in Dumfriesshire (rough stream); Altderg (red stream).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALTUN, or ALTAN (Tartar),]\r\n\r\ngolden; _e.g._ the Altai, or golden mountains; Altanor (golden lake);\r\nAltan-su (golden river); Alta-Yeen (the golden mountains); Altun-tash\r\n(golden rock); Altun-kupri (golden bridge).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AM, or AN,]\r\n\r\ncontrac. from Ger. _an den_ (on the, or at the); _e.g._ Amberg (at the\r\nhill); Amdorf or Ambach, Amsteg, Amwalde (at the village, brook, path,\r\nwood).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMAR (Old Ger.),]\r\n\r\na kind of grain; _e.g._ Amarbach, Amarthal, Amarwang, Amarveld (the\r\nbrook, valley, strip of land, field where this grain grew).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMBACHT, or AMT (Ger.),]\r\n\r\na district under the government of an Amtman or bailiff; _e.g._\r\nAmt-sluis (the sluice of the Ambacht); Amthof (the court of the\r\nAmtman); Graven-Ambacht (the duke’s district); Ambachtsbrug (the bridge\r\nof the Ambacht).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMBR,]\r\n\r\nan Indo-Germanic word, signifying a river, allied to the Sansc. _ambu_\r\n(water).

Some of the river names may have come from the Sansc. _ara_\r\n(swift, or the flowing), and in Tamil _aar_ means simply a river. There\r\nis another Sanscrit word _arb_ (to ravage or destroy), with which\r\nthe Gadhelic words _garw_, _garbh_ (rough) may be connected; and, on\r\nthe other hand, there is the Welsh _araf_ (gentle).

The term, as applied to the old residences, presupposed the\r\nexistence of a fortified brugh or rath, several of which still remain.\r\nThe word has suffered many corruptions: thus Bruree, in Limerick, is\r\nfrom _Brugh-righ_ (the king’s fort); and _Bruighean_ (little fort)\r\nhas been transformed into Bruff, Bruis, Bruce, or Bryan. The word\r\n_briva_, on the other hand, was generally applied to towns situated\r\non rivers--as in Amiens, anc. _Samarabrina_, on the R.

The Romans called the castles built by Roman\r\nsettlers in the provinces _cortes_ or _cortem_, thence _court_ became\r\na common affix to the names of mansions in England and France--thus\r\nHampton Court and Hunton Court, in England; Leoncourt, Aubigne-court,\r\nHonnecourt (the mansion of Leo, Albinius, and Honulf); Aubercourt (of\r\nAlbert); Mirecourt, Lat. _Mercurii-curtis_, where altars were wont\r\nto be dedicated to Mercury. From the diminutives of this word arose\r\nCortiles, Cortina, Corticella, Courcelles, etc. The words _court_,\r\n_cour_, and _corte_ were also used as equivalent to the Lat. _curia_\r\n(the place of assembly for the provincial councils)--thus Corte, in\r\nCorsica, where the courts of justice were held; but Corsica itself\r\nderived its name from the Phœnician _chorsi_ (a woody place). The\r\nCortes, in Spain, evidently equivalent to the Lat. _curia_, gives\r\nits name to several towns in that country; Coire, the capital of\r\nthe Grisons, in Switzerland, comes from the anc. _Curia Rhætiorum_\r\n(the place where the provincial councils of the Rhætians were held);\r\nCorbridge, in Northumberland, is supposed to take its name from a Roman\r\n_curia_, and perhaps Currie, in East Lothian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRAIG, CARRAIG, CARRICK (Gadhelic),\r\nCRAIG (Cym.-Cel.),]\r\n\r\na rock; _e.g._ Craigie, Creich, Crathie, Gael. _Creagach_ (rocky),\r\nparishes in Scotland; Carrick and Carrig, in Ireland (either the rocks\r\nor rocky ground); Carrick-on-Suir (the rock of the R.

Fife, so called\r\nfrom its situation at a spot where roads cross each other. It was\r\nusual with the Celts in Ireland, as well as with the Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese in America, to mark the place where any providential event\r\nhad occurred, or where they founded a church or city, by erecting a\r\ncross--as in St. Croix, Santa-Cruz, and Vera Cruz (the true cross),\r\nin South America. In Ireland: Crosserlough (the cross on the lake);\r\nCrossmolina (O’Mulleeny’s cross); Aghacross (the fort at the cross);\r\nCrossard (high cross); Crossreagh (gray cross); Crossmaglen, Irish\r\n_Cros-mag-Fhloinn_ (the cross of Flann’s son); Crossau, Crossoge, and\r\nCrusheen (little cross); Oswestry, in Shropshire, anc. _Croes-Oswalt_\r\n(the cross on which Oswald, King of Northumberland, was executed by\r\nPenda of Mercia).

In the reign of James I. the\r\nchurch of Corstorphine became a collegiate foundation, with a provost,\r\nfour prebendaries, and two singing boys. _Croich_ in Gaelic means a\r\ngallows--thus Knockacrochy (gallows hill); Raheenacrochy (the little\r\nfort of the gallows), in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CROAGH (Gael.),]\r\n\r\na hill of a round form--from _cruach_ (a haystack); _e.g._ Croghan,\r\nCrohane (the little round hill); Ballycroghan (the town of the little\r\nhill), in Ireland; Bencruachan (the stack-shaped hill), in Argyleshire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CROFT (A.S.),]\r\n\r\nan enclosed field; _e.g._ Crofton (the town on the croft); Thornycroft\r\n(thorny field).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CROM, CRUM (Gadhelic),\r\nCRWM (Cym.-Cel.),\r\nKRUMM (Ger.),\r\nCRUMB (A.S.),]\r\n\r\ncrooked; _e.g._ Cromdale (the winding valley), in Inverness-shire;\r\nCroome, in Worcester; Cromlin, Crimlin (the winding glen, _ghlinn_),\r\nin Ireland; Krumbach (the winding brook); Krumau and Krumenau (the\r\nwinding water or valley); Ancrum, a village in Roxburghshire, situated\r\nat the _bend_ of the R.

Thus, in\r\nScandinavia, and in localities of Great Britain where the Danes and\r\nNorsemen had settlements, we have--Romsdalen and Vaerdal, the valleys\r\nof the Raumer and Vaer, in Norway; Langenthal, on the R. Langent, in\r\nSwitzerland; Rydal (rye valley), Westmoreland; Laugdalr (the valley\r\nof warm springs), Iceland. In districts again peopled by the Saxons,\r\nAvondale, Annandale (the valleys of the Avon and Annan). This is the\r\ngeneral rule, although there are exceptions--Rosenthal (the valley of\r\nroses); Inn-thal (of the R. Inn); Freudenthal (of joy); Fromenthal\r\n(wheat valley); Grunthal (green valley). In Gaelic, Irish, and Welsh\r\nnames, on the contrary, _dal_ precedes the defining word; _e.g._ Dalry\r\nand Dalrigh (king’s level field); Dalbeth and Dalbeathie (the field of\r\nbirches); Dalginross (the field at the head of the promontory or wood);\r\nDalness and Dallas (the field of the cascade, _cas_); Dalserf (of St.\r\nSerf); Dailly, in Ayrshire, anc. _Dalmaolkeran_ (the field of the\r\nservant, _maol_, of St. Kiaran); Dalrymple (the valley of the rumbling\r\npool, _ruaemleagh_); Dalgarnock (of the rough hillock); Dalhousie (the\r\nfield at the corner of the water, _i.e._ of the Esk); Dalwhinnie (the\r\nfield of the meeting, _coinneach_); Dalziel (beautiful field, _geal_);\r\nDalguise (of the fir-trees, _giuthas_); Dalnaspittal (the field of\r\nthe _spideal_, _i.e._ the house of entertainment); Dalnacheaich (of\r\nthe stone); Dalnacraoibhe (of the tree); Dalbowie (yellow field).\r\nDollar, in Clackmannan, may be from this root, although there is a\r\ntradition that it took its name from a castle in the parish called\r\nCastle-Gloom, Gael. _doillair_ (dark); Deal or Dole (the valley in\r\nKent); Dol and Dole, in Brittany, with the same meaning; Doldrewin (the\r\nvalley of the Druidical circles in Wales); Dolquan (the owl’s meadow);\r\nDolau-Cothi (the meadows of the River Cothi); Dolgelly (the grove of\r\nhazels); Dalkeith (the narrow valley, _caeth_); Codale (cow field);\r\nGrisdale (swine field); Gasdale (goosefield); Balderdale, Silverdale,\r\nUldale, Ennerdale, Ransdale (from the personal names, Balder, Sölvar,\r\nUlf, Einer, Hrani); Brachendale (the valley of ferns); Berrydale, in\r\nCaithness, corrupt. from Old Norse, _Berudalr_ (the valley of the\r\nproductive wood); Dalecarlia, called by the Swedes _Dahlena_ (the\r\nvalleys); Dieppedal (deep valley); Stendal (stony valley); Oundle, in\r\nNorthampton, corrupt. from _Avondle_; Kendal or Kirkby-Kendal (the\r\nchurch town in the valley of the R.

The three brothers, Fergus, Sorn, and\r\nAnghus, came to Argyleshire in 503 A.D. Toul and Toulouse, situated\r\nin valleys, probably were named from the same root-word; Toulouse was\r\nanciently called _Civitas-Tolosatium_ (the city of the valley dwellers,\r\n_dol-saetas_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DAL, or GEDEL (A.S.),\r\nDEEL (Dutch),\r\nTHEIL (Ger.),\r\nDAL (Irish),]\r\n\r\na part, a district; _e.g._ Kalthusertheil (the district of the cold\r\nhouses); Kerckdorfertheil (the district of the village church);\r\nBaradeel (the barren district), in Germany and Holland.

The Danish king fell in this battle, and was\r\nburied in the churchyard of Cruden.

In other cases it is\r\nopposed to _Walsch_ (foreign--_v._ WALSCH), as in Deutsch-steinach and\r\nWalsh-steinach (the German and foreign towns on the _Steinach_, or\r\nstony water). The Romans employed the word _Germania_ for _Deutsch_,\r\nwhich Professor Leo traces to a Celtic root _gair-mean_ (one who\r\ncries out or shouts); _e.g._ Deutschen, in the Tyrol; Deutz, in\r\nRhenish Prussia; Deutschendorf, in Hungary; Deutschenhausen, in\r\nMoravia, i.e. the dwellings of the Germans.

It was not till the seventeenth century that the word\r\n_Dutch_ was restricted to the Low Germans.

In French topography _ingen_\r\ntakes the forms of _igny_, _igné_, or _inges_; and it appears, by\r\ncomparing the names of many towns and villages in England and the\r\nnorth-west of France with those of Germany, that Teutonic tribes\r\nforming settlements in these countries transferred the names in their\r\nnative land to their new homes. For the full elucidation of this\r\nsubject reference may be made to Taylor’s _Words and Places_, chap.\r\nvii. and the Appendix, and to Edmund’s _Names of Places_, p. 58.\r\nOnly a few examples of the use of this patronymic can be given here;\r\nthus, from the _Offings_--Oving and Ovingham, corresponding to the\r\nGer. Offingen and the Fr. Offignes. From the _Eppings_--Epping, Ger.\r\nEppinghofen, and Fr. Epagne. The _Bings_--Bing, Bingham, Bingley;\r\nGer. Bingen; Fr. Buigny. The _Basings_--Eng. Basing, Basingham,\r\nBessingby; Fr. Bazigny. From the _Raedings_--Reading, Co. Berks.\r\nThe _Harlings_--Harlington. The _Billings_--Bellington. From the\r\n_Moerings_ or _Merovingians_ many French towns and villages are named;\r\n_e.g._ Morigny, Marigné, Merignac, Merrigny; in England--Merring,\r\nMerrington. We can sometimes trace these tribe names to the nature of\r\nthe localities which they inhabited. Thus the _Bucings_, from which we\r\nhave Boking and Buckingham, to a locality abounding in beech-trees,\r\n_boc_; the _Durotriges_, from which we have Dorset and Dorchester, are\r\nthe dwellers by the water, _dur_; as well as the _Eburovices_, who gave\r\ntheir name to Evreux, in France. _Ing_, also, in A.S. names, sometimes\r\nmeans a meadow, as in Clavering, in Essex (clover meadow), A.S.\r\n_Claefer_; Mountnessing, Co. Essex (the meadow of the Mountneys, who\r\nwere formerly lords of the manor); Godalming (the meadow of Godhelm).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INNER (Ger.),]\r\n\r\nopposed to _ausser_ (the inner and outer), as in Innerzell, Ausserzell\r\n(the inner and outer church).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INNIS (Gadhelic),\r\nYNYS, ENEZ (Cym.-Cel.),\r\nINSEL (Ger.),\r\nINSULA (Lat.),\r\nNESOS (Grk.),]\r\n\r\nan island, also in some cases pasture land near water, or a peninsula.\r\nIt often takes the form of _inch_, as in Inchkeith (the island of the\r\nKeith family); Inchcolm (St. Columba’s Island); Inchfad (long isle);\r\nInchgarvie (the rough island); Inchard (high isle); Inch-Cailleach\r\n(the island of the old women or nuns), in Loch Lomond, being the site\r\nof an ancient nunnery; Inchmarnoch (of St. Marnoch), in the Firth of\r\nClyde; Inchbrackie (the spotted isle); Inchgower (the goat’s isle);\r\nInchtuthill (the island of the flooded stream); Craignish, anc.\r\n_Craiginche_ (the rocky peninsula); Durness, in Sutherlandshire, is a\r\ncorrupt. from _Doirbh-innis_ (the stormy peninsula); Ynys-Bronwen (the\r\nisland of Bronwen, a Welsh lady who was buried there), in Anglesey;\r\nYnis-wyllt (wild island), off the coast of Wales; Inysawdre (the\r\nisle and home of refuge), in Glamorgan. In Ireland: Ennis (the river\r\nmeadow); Enniskillen, Irish _Inis-Cethlenn_ (the island of Cethlenn,\r\nan ancient queen of Ireland); Ennisheen (beautiful island); Devenish,\r\nin Lough Erne, is _Daimhinis_ (the island of oxen). But Enniskerry is\r\nnot from this root; it is corrupt. from _Ath-na-scairbhe_ (the rough\r\nford); Orkney Isles, Gael. _Orc-innis_ (the islands of whales); they\r\nare sometimes called _Earr-Cath_ (the tail of Caithness); Innisfallen,\r\nin Lake Kallarney (the island of Fathlenn); the Hebrides or Sudereys,\r\ncalled _Innisgall_ (the islands of the Gaels); the Aleutian Islands,\r\nfrom Russ. _aleut_ (a bald rock); in Holland, Duiveland (pigeon\r\nisland), and Eyerlandt (the island of the sand-bank); Eilenburg, in\r\nSaxony (the town on an island in the R.

In Ireland:\r\nLegachory, Lagacurry, Legacurry (the hollow of the pit or caldron,\r\n_coire_); Lugduff (dark hollow); Lugnaquillia (the highest of the\r\nWicklow mountains), is from the Irish _Lug-na-gcoilleach_ (the hollow\r\nof the cocks, _i.e._ _grouse_); Lough Logan (the lake of the little\r\nhollow); Lagnieu, in France, anc. _Lagniacum_ (the place in the hollow\r\nof the waters); Laconia and Lacedemonia (in the hollow), in Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LANN (Gadhelic),\r\nLLAN (Cym.-Cel.),\r\nLAND (Teut.),]\r\n\r\nan enclosure, a church, a house; but Mr. Skene considers that the\r\nCel. _llan_ comes from the Lat. _planum_ (a level place), just as\r\nthe Gael. _lan_ (full) comes from the Lat. _plenus_. This word is\r\nmore common in Welsh names than in the topography of Ireland and\r\nScotland, and in its signification of a church forms the groundwork of\r\na vast number of Welsh names. In Ireland it means a house as well as\r\na church, as in Landbrock (the badger’s house); Landmore (the great\r\nchurch), in Londonderry; Landahussy (O’Hussy’s church), in Tyrone;\r\nLanaglug (the church of the bells). It is not so frequent in Scotland,\r\nbut the modern name of Lamlash, in the Island of Arran, formerly\r\n_Ard-na-Molas_, the height of St. Molios, who lived in a cave there,\r\nseems to be the church or enclosure of this saint; Lambride, in Forfar,\r\nis _Lannbride_ (St. Bridget’s church); Lumphanan is from _Lann-Finan_\r\n(St. Finan’s church). The derivation of Lanark, anc. _Lanerk_, is\r\nprobably from the Welsh _Llanerch_ (a distinct spot or fertile piece\r\nof ground). There are many examples of this root in Brittany; _e.g._\r\nLanleff (the enclosure on the R. Leff); Lanmeur (great church);\r\nLannion (the little enclosure); Landerneau and Lannoy (the enclosure\r\non the water); but in French topography the Teut. _land_ generally\r\nsignifies uncultivated ground; _e.g._ La Lande, Landes, Landelles, La\r\nLandelle, Les Landais, Landau, etc.--_v._ Cocheris’s _Noms de Lieu_.\r\nLaunceston, in Cornwall, is probably corrupt. from _Llan-Stephen_. The\r\ngreatest number of our examples must be taken from Wales. There are\r\nLantony or _Llan-Ddevinant_ (the church of St. David in the valley,\r\n_nant_, of the R. Hodeny); Llan-Dewi-Aberarth (St. David’s church at\r\nthe mouth of the Arth); Lampeter (of St. Peter); Llan-Asaph (of St.\r\nAsaph); Llanbadern-fawr (the great church founded by Paternus), also\r\nLlan-Badarn-Odyn; Llandelo-vawr (of Feilo the Great); Llandewi-Brefi\r\n(St. David’s church).

In Ireland this word takes\r\nthe forms of _laragh_ and _lara_; _e.g._ Laraghleas (the site of the\r\nfort); Laraghshankill (of the old church). Lara, however, is sometimes\r\na corrupt. of _Leath-rath_ (half rath), as in Laragh, in West Meath;\r\nand _laar_ and _lare_ often mean _middle_, as in Rosslare (the middle\r\npeninsula); Ennislare (the middle island); Latheron, in Caithness, is\r\nthe site of the seal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LAUF, LAUFEND (Ger.),\r\nLOOP (Dutch),]\r\n\r\na current, a rapid, from _laufen_, Ger.; _hlaupen_, Scand.; _hleapen_,\r\nA.S.

Traces of these institutions appear\r\nin the topography of certain districts in Great Britain formerly\r\noccupied by Danes or Norwegians. The Norwegian Parliament is still\r\ncalled the _Storthing_ or great assembly; smaller courts are called\r\n_Lawthings_, and the _Althing_ was the general assembly of the whole\r\nnation. These meetings were generally held on some remote island,\r\nhill, or promontory, where their deliberations might be undisturbed.\r\nThe Swedish Parliament used to assemble on a mound near Upsala, which\r\nstill bears the name of _Tingshogen_, Scand. _haugr_; Thingveller (the\r\ncouncil-plains), in Iceland; Sandsthing (the place of meeting on the\r\nsand), in Iceland; Aithsthing (the meeting-place on the headland),\r\nin Iceland; Dingwall, in Ross-shire, has the same derivation--its\r\nGaelic name is _Inverpeffer_ (at the mouth of that stream); Tingwall,\r\nin Shetland, Tynwald Hill, Isle of Man, Thingwall in Cheshire, and\r\nDinsdale in Durham, from the same root; Tinwald, in Dumfries (the wood\r\nof the meeting); Tain, in Ross-shire, Norse _Thing_--its Gaelic name is\r\n_Baile-Duich_ (St. Duthic’s town).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THOR and THUR,]\r\n\r\nprefixes derived from the Saxon and Scandinavian deity _Thor_; _e.g._\r\nThorley, Thurley, Thursley, Thorsby, Thurlow, the valley, dwelling,\r\nand hill, named after Thor, or perhaps from a people or family name\r\nderived from the god, _i.e._ the _Thurings_, from whence also probably\r\ncome Thorington in England, and Thorigné and Thorigny in France;\r\nThüringerwald, in Germany; Thurston, Thursford, Thurscross, Thurlstone,\r\netc.; Thorsoe (Thor’s island); Thurso (Thor’s stream, on which the\r\ntown of Thurso is situated); Thorshaven (Thor’s harbour), in Norway\r\nand in the Faroe Islands. On the continent the god Thor was worshipped\r\nunder the name of Thunor, hence the English word _thunder_ and the\r\nGerman _Donner_ (supposed, in the Middle Ages, to be Thor’s voice).\r\nFrom this word are derived Thunersberg and Donnersberg (the mountain of\r\nThor); Donnersbach (Thor’s stream), in Styria; Torslunde (Thor’s sacred\r\ngrove), in Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THORPE (A.S.),]\r\n\r\nan assembly of people, cognate with the Welsh _torf_ (a crowd or\r\ntroop), Gael. _treubh_ (a tribe), and _troupe_, French; and then\r\ngradually coming to denote a farm or village; _e.g._ Thorp, in\r\nNorthamptonshire; Calthorpe (cold village); Langthorpe (long village);\r\nIngelthorpe, Kettlesthorpe, Swansthorpe, Bischopsthorpe (the farm or\r\nvillage of Ingold, Kettle, Sweyn, and the bishop); Nunthorpe (the nun’s\r\nvillage); Raventhorpe (Hrafen’s village); Thorparch, in Yorkshire\r\n(the village bridge), on the R.

Wells and\r\nfountains were held in great veneration by the Celts in heathen times,\r\nand are the subjects of many traditions in Ireland and Scotland. Many\r\nof the early preachers of Christianity established their foundations\r\nnear these venerated wells, which were the common resorts of the\r\npeople whom they had come to convert. In this way the new religion\r\nbecame associated in the minds of the converts with their favourite\r\nwells, and obtained the names of the saints, by which they are known\r\nto this day; _e.g._ Tobermory (St. Mary’s well), in the Island of\r\nMull; Tobar-na-bhan-thighern (the chieftainess’s well), in Badenoch;\r\nBallintobar (the town of the well), Co. Mayo, now called Tobermore (the\r\ngreat well), which had a well blessed by St. Patrick; Tibbermore or\r\nTippermuir (the great well), in Perthshire; Tobar-nam-buadh, in Skye\r\n(the well of virtues); Tipperary, anc. _Tiobrad-Arann_ (the well of the\r\ndistrict of Ara); Tipperkevin (St. Kevin’s well); Tipperstown, anc.\r\n_Baile-an-tobair_ (the town of the well); Tobercurry (the well of the\r\ncauldron); Toberbilly (the well of the old tree); Tobernaclug (the well\r\nof the bells, _clog_). Bells were held sacred by the Irish on account\r\nof a certain bell favoured by St. Patrick. Perhaps the rivers Tiber and\r\nTiverone, as well as Tivoli, anc. _Tibur_, may come from this root.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOFT, TOT (Scand.),]\r\n\r\nan enclosure or farm; _e.g._ Lowestoft, Dan. _Luetoft_ (the enclosure\r\nor place of the beacon-fire, which in early times was placed on the\r\npromontory where the town stands); Langtoft (long farm); Monk’s Tofts\r\n(the monk’s farm), and West Tofts, in Norfolk; Ecclestofts (the church\r\nfarm buildings), in Berwickshire; Ivetot, anc. _Ivonis-tot_ (the farm\r\nof Ivo and Hautot (high farm), in Normandy; Sassetot (the Saxon’s\r\nfarm); Littletot (little farm); Berguetot (birch farm), in Normandy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOM (Gadhelic and Welsh),]\r\n\r\na knoll or mound; _e.g._ Tomintoul (the knoll of the barn), Gael.\r\n_Tom-an-t-sabhail_, Co.

The primary meaning of this word comes from\r\nthe Gothic _tains_, Scand. _teinn_, Ger. _zaun_, a fence or hedge\r\nformed of twigs. Originally it meant a place rudely fortified with\r\nstakes, and was applied to single farm-steadings and manors, in which\r\nsense _tun_ is still used in Iceland, and _toon_ in Scotland. The\r\nword _toon_ retained this restricted meaning even in England in the\r\ntime of Wickliffe. These single enclosures became the nucleus of a\r\nvillage which, gradually increasing, became a town or city, in the same\r\nmanner as villages and towns arose around the Celtic _duns_, _raths_,\r\nand _lises_. This root, in the names of towns and villages, is more\r\ncommon than any other in Anglo-Saxon topography, being an element\r\nin an eighth part of the names of dwelling-places in the south of\r\nGreat Britain. The greatest number of these names is connected with\r\nthose of the original proprietors of the places, of which but a few\r\nexamples can be given here.

The Gadhelic _gall_ (foreign),\r\nalthough used with the same meaning as _wealh_, is not connected with\r\nit. It is a word that has been applied to strangers by the Irish\r\nfrom the remotest antiquity; and as it was applied by them to the\r\nnatives of Gaul (_Galli_), _gall_, in the first instance, might mean\r\nsimply a native of Gaul. It was afterwards used in reference to the\r\nNorwegians, _Fionn-ghaill_ (the _fair_-haired strangers); and to the\r\nDanes, _Dubh-ghaill_ (the _dark_-haired strangers); and in connection\r\nwith them and with the English the word enters largely into Irish\r\ntopography; _e.g._ Donegal, _i.e._ _Dun-nau-Gall_ (the fortress of\r\nthe foreigners or Danes); Clonegall and Clongall (the meadow of the\r\nstrangers); Ballynagall and Ballnagall (the town of the strangers,\r\nor English).

According to Leo, the Teut. _wich_ or _vichs_ arose from\r\nthe root _waes_, A.S., and _wiese_, Ger. (a moist meadow) and hence\r\nwas applied to places situated on low lands, often on the bank of\r\na stream; _e.g._ Meeswyk (the town on the Maas); Beverwyk, on the\r\nBever. The primary meaning seems to have been a station--with the\r\nAnglo-Saxons a station or abode on the _land_, with the Norsemen a\r\nstation for _ships_. The root of the word runs through all the Aryan\r\nlanguages--Sansc. _veça_, Grk. _oikos_, Pol. _wies_, Ir. _fieh_,\r\nCym.-Cel. _qwic_, all meaning an abode; _e.g._ Alnwick (the town on\r\nthe R.

Schlie), in Prussia; Wick (the\r\ntown on the bay), in Caithness; Sandwich (the town on the sandy bay);\r\nLerwick (on the muddy bay); Greenwich, Scand. _Granvigen_ (the town on\r\nthe pine bay); Reikjavik, in Iceland (the reeky or smoky bay); Vigo\r\nin Spain, and Vaage in Norway (on spacious bays); Swanage, in Dorset,\r\nanc. _Swanwick_ (Sweyen’s bay town); Brodick, in Arran (the broad bay\r\ntown); Wicklow, in Ireland, probably Danish _Vigloe_ (bay shelter),\r\nused by the Danes as a ship station; Smerwick (butter bay); Berwick,\r\ncontracted from _Aberwick_ (at the mouth of the R. Tweed)--_v._ ABER.\r\n_Wiche_ also denotes a place where there are salt mines or springs, and\r\nin this sense is probably connected with the Scand. _vig_, as salt was\r\noften obtained by the evaporation of sea-water in shallow bays; thus\r\nNantwich--_v._ NANT; Middlewich (the middle salt works); Droitwich,\r\nLat. _Salinæ_ (the salt springs, where the _droit_ or tax was paid).\r\nIn some cases _wich_ or _wick_ is derived from the Lat. _vicus_,\r\ncognate with the Grk. _oikos_ and Sansc. _veça_ (a dwelling)--thus\r\nKatwyk-sur-mer and Katwyk-sur-Rhin are supposed to occupy the site\r\nof the Roman _Vicus-Cattorum_ (the dwelling-place of the Chatti);\r\nVick or Vique, in Spain, from _Vicus-Ausoniensis_ (the dwelling of\r\nthe Ausones); Vidauban, in France, from _Vicus-Albanus_ (the dwelling\r\nof Albanus); Longwy, from _Longus-vicus_ (long town); Limoges, anc.\r\n_Lemovicum_ (the town of the Lemovici); also in France: Vic-desprès\r\n(the town on the meadows); Vic-sur-Losse and Vic-sur-Aisne, the towns\r\non these rivers. The Sclav. _wice_ is found in Jazlowice (the town on\r\nthe marsh); and Malschwice (Matthew’s town), etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WIDR, or VITU (Teut. and Scand.),]\r\n\r\nwood; _e.g._ Norwood (north wood); Selwood, Lat. _Sylva-magna_ (great\r\nwood), Celtic _Coitmaur_; Coteswold (from its sheep-cotes, in the\r\nwood); the Wolds, near Wolderness, in Yorkshire; Ringwood, in Hants,\r\nLat. _Regni-sylva_ (the wood or forest of the _Regni_, a tribe);\r\nWittstock and Woodstock (woody place); but Wittingau, Wittingen,\r\nWittgenstein, Wittgensdorf, and other names with this prefix in\r\nGermany, come from the patronymic _Wittick_ or _Wittikind_ (_i.e._ the\r\nchildren of the woods).
