It is curious\r\nthat a classic of so much renown and intrinsic value should have\r\nremained a comparatively sealed book to this country for so many\r\ncenturies; yet such is the fact. It is true that the imperfect state of\r\nthe Greek text, and the difficulty of geographical identification, have\r\nalways been appalling obstacles; yet, after the acute and valuable\r\nlabours of Gossellin, Du Theil, Groskurd, and especially of Gustav\r\nCramer of Berlin, (whose text is followed in the present volume,) we\r\nmight fairly have expected that some English scholar would have ventured\r\nto enter the field. But the task, like many in a similar position, has\r\nbeen reserved for the publisher of the Classical Library, and he trusts\r\nit will be found conscientiously fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe translation was, in the first instance, intrusted to Mr. H. C.\r\nHamilton, whose knowledge of the subject, and familiarity with the\r\nvarious languages concerned, peculiarly fitted him for the undertaking.\r\nHis official duties, however, added to his anxious examination of every\r\nthing which tended to illustrate his author, prevented his proceeding\r\nwith much speed; and it was only after the lapse of three years that he\r\nhad reached the end of the sixth book. In the mean time it transpired\r\nthat Mr. W. Falconer, son of the editor of the Oxford edition of the\r\nGreek text, had, after several years of care and attention, produced a\r\nvery excellent translation, meaning to publish it. Under the\r\ncircumstances it was deemed advisable to amalgamate the rival\r\nundertakings, and it is a source of gratification to the publisher that\r\nthe respective translators were each so well satisfied with the labours\r\nof the other, that they assented readily to his proposal of associating\r\ntheir names.\r\n\r\nThis is all it seems necessary to state here. In the third volume will\r\nbe given some account of the life and labours of Strabo, and of the\r\nmanuscripts and principal editions; also a complete index of the places\r\nmentioned in the text, accompanied, where possible, by the modern names.\r\n\r\n   H. G. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRABO’S GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   That geographical investigation is not inconsistent with\r\n   philosophy.—That Homer gives proof of it throughout his\r\n   poems.—That they who first wrote on the science have omitted\r\n   much, or given disjointed, defective, false, or inconsistent\r\n   accounts.—Proofs and demonstrations of the correctness of this\r\n   statement, with general heads containing a summary description of\r\n   the disposition of the whole habitable earth.—Credit to be\r\n   attached to the probabilities and evident proofs that in many\r\n   regions the land and sea have been shifted, and exchanged places\r\n   with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.[1] If the scientific investigation of any subject be the proper\r\navocation of the philosopher, Geography, the science of which we propose\r\nto treat, is certainly entitled to a high place; and this is evident\r\nfrom many considerations. They who first ventured to handle the matter\r\nwere distinguished men, Homer, Anaximander the Milesian, and Hecatæus,\r\n(his fellow-citizen according to Eratosthenes,) Democritus, Eudoxus,\r\nDicæarchus, Ephorus, with many others, and after these for Eratosthenes,\r\nPolybius, and Posidonius, all of them philosophers.\r\n\r\nNor is the great learning, through which alone this subject can be\r\napproached, possessed by any but a person acquainted with both human and\r\ndivine things,[2] and these attainments constitute what is called\r\nphilosophy. In addition to its vast importance in regard to social life,\r\nand the art of government, Geography unfolds to us the celestial\r\nphenomena, acquaints us with the occupants of the land and ocean, and\r\nthe vegetation, fruits, and peculiarities of the various quarters of the\r\nearth, a knowledge of which marks him who cultivates it as a man earnest\r\nin the great problem of life and happiness.\r\n\r\n2. Admitting this, let us examine more in detail the points we have\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nAnd first, [we maintain,] that both we and our predecessors, amongst\r\nwhom is Hipparchus, do justly regard Homer as the founder of\r\ngeographical science, for he not only excelled all, ancient as well as\r\nmodern, in the sublimity of his poetry, but also in his experience of\r\nsocial life. Thus it was that he not only exerted himself to become\r\nfamiliar with as many historic facts as possible, and transmit them to\r\nposterity, but also with the various regions of the inhabited land and\r\nsea, some intimately, others in a more general manner. For otherwise he\r\nwould not have reached the utmost limits of the earth, traversing it in\r\nhis imagination.\r\n\r\n3. First, he stated that the earth was entirely encompassed by the\r\nocean, as in truth it is; afterwards he described the countries,\r\nspecifying some by name, others more generally by various indications,\r\nexplicitly defining Libya,[3] Ethiopia, the Sidonians, and the Erembi\r\n(by which latter are probably intended the Troglodyte Arabians); and\r\nalluding to those farther east and west as the lands washed by the\r\nocean, for in ocean he believed both the sun and constellations to rise\r\nand set.\r\n\r\n   “Now from the gently-swelling flood profound\r\n   The sun arising, with his earliest rays,\r\n   In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields.”[4]\r\n\r\n   “And now the radiant sun in ocean sank,\r\n   Dragging night after him o’er all the earth.”[5]\r\n\r\nThe stars also he describes as bathed in the ocean.[6]\r\n\r\n4. He portrays the happiness of the people of the West, and the\r\nsalubrity of their climate, having no doubt heard of the abundance of\r\nIberia,[7] which had attracted the arms of Hercules,[8] afterwards of\r\nthe Phœnicians, who acquired there an extended rule, and finally of the\r\nRomans. There the airs of Zephyr breathe, there the poet feigned the\r\nfields of Elysium, when he tells us Menelaus was sent thither by the\r\ngods:—\r\n\r\n                           “Thee the gods\r\n   Have destined to the blest Elysian isles,\r\n   Earth’s utmost boundaries. Rhadamanthus there\r\n   For ever reigns, and there the human kind\r\n   Enjoy the easiest life; no snow is there,\r\n   No biting winter, and no drenching shower,\r\n   But Zephyr always gently from the sea\r\n   Breathes on them, to refresh the happy race.”[9]\r\n\r\n5. The Isles of the Blest[10] are on the extreme west of Maurusia,[11]\r\nnear where its shore runs parallel to the opposite coast of Spain; and\r\nit is clear he considered these regions also Blest, from their\r\ncontiguity to the Islands.\r\n\r\n6. He tells us also, that the Ethiopians are far removed, and bounded by\r\nthe ocean: far removed,—\r\n\r\n   “The Ethiopians, utmost of mankind,\r\n   These eastward situate, those toward the west.”[12]\r\n\r\nNor was he mistaken in calling them separated into two divisions, as we\r\nshall presently show: and next to the ocean,—\r\n\r\n   “For to the banks of the Oceanus,\r\n   Where Ethiopia holds a feast to Jove,\r\n   He journey’d yesterday.”[13]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Bear, he implies that the most northern part of the\r\nearth is bounded by the ocean:\r\n\r\n         “Only star of those denied\r\n   To slake his beams in Ocean’s briny baths.”[14]\r\n\r\nNow, by the “Bear” and the “Wain,” he means the Arctic Circle; otherwise\r\nhe would never have said, “It _alone_ is deprived of the baths of the\r\nocean,” when such an _infinity_ of stars is to be seen continually\r\nrevolving in that part of the hemisphere. Let no one any longer blame\r\nhis ignorance for being merely acquainted with one Bear, when there are\r\ntwo. It is probable that the second was not considered a constellation\r\nuntil, on the Phœnicians specially designating it, and employing it in\r\nnavigation, it became known as one to the Greeks.[15] Such is the case\r\nwith the Hair of Berenice, and Canopus, whose names are but of\r\nyesterday; and, as Aratus remarks, there are numbers which have not yet\r\nreceived any designation. Crates, therefore, is mistaken when,\r\nendeavouring to amend what is correct, he reads the verse thus:\r\n\r\n   Οἶος δ’ ἄμμορός ἐστι λοετρῶν,\r\n\r\nreplacing οἴη by οἶος, with a view to make the adjective agree with the\r\nArctic Circle, which is masculine; instead of the Arctic Constellation,\r\nwhich is feminine. The expression of Heraclitus is far more preferable\r\nand Homeric, who thus figuratively describes the Arctic Circle as the\r\nBear,—“The Bear is the limit of the dawn and of the evening, and from\r\nthe region of the Bear we have fine weather.” Now it is not the\r\nconstellation of the Bear, but the Arctic Circle, which is the limit of\r\nthe rising and the setting stars.\r\n\r\nBy the Bear, then, which he elsewhere calls the Wain, and describes as\r\npursuing Orion, Homer means us to understand the Arctic Circle; and by\r\nthe ocean, that horizon into which, and out of which, the stars rise and\r\nset. When he says that the Bear turns round and is deprived of the\r\nocean, he was aware that the Arctic Circle [always] extended to the sign\r\nopposite the most northern point of the horizon. Adapting the words of\r\nthe poet to this view, by that part of the earth nearest to the ocean we\r\nmust understand the horizon, and by the Arctic Circle that which extends\r\nto the signs which seem to our senses to touch in succession the most\r\nnorthern point of the horizon. Thus, according to him, this portion of\r\nthe earth is washed by the ocean. With the nations of the North he was\r\nwell acquainted, although he does not mention them by name, and indeed\r\nat the present day there is no regular title by which they are all\r\ndistinguished. He informs us of their mode of life, describing them as\r\n“wanderers,” “noble milkers of mares,” “living on cheese,” and “without\r\nwealth.”[16]\r\n\r\n7. In the following speech of Juno, he states that the ocean surrounds\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n   “For to the green earth’s utmost bounds I go,\r\n   To visit there the parent of the gods,\r\n   Oceanus.”[17]\r\n\r\nDoes he not here assert that ocean bounds all its extremities, and does\r\nit not surround these extremities? Again, in the\r\n\r\nHoplopœia,[18] he places the ocean in a circle round the border of\r\nAchilles’ shield. Another proof of the extent of his knowledge, is his\r\nacquaintance with the ebb and flow of the sea, calling it “the ebbing\r\nocean.”[19] Again,\r\n\r\n   “Each day she thrice disgorges, and again\r\n   Thrice drinks, insatiate, the deluge down.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe assertion of thrice, instead of twice, is either an error of the\r\nauthor, or a blunder of the scribe, but the phenomenon is the same, and\r\nthe expression soft-flowing,[21] has reference to the flood-tide, which\r\nhas a gentle swell, and does not flow with a full rush. Posidonius\r\nbelieves that where Homer describes the rocks as at one time covered\r\nwith the waves, and at another left bare, and when he compares the ocean\r\nto a river, he alludes to the flow of the ocean. The first supposition\r\nis correct, but for the second there is no ground; inasmuch as there can\r\nbe no comparison between the flow, much less the ebb of the sea, and the\r\ncurrent of a river. There is more probability in the explanation of\r\nCrates, that Homer describes the whole ocean as deep-flowing, ebbing,\r\nand also calls it a river, and that he also describes a part of the\r\nocean as a river, and the flow of a river; and that he is speaking of a\r\npart, and not the whole, when he thus writes:—\r\n\r\n   “When down the smooth Oceanus impell’d\r\n   By prosperous gales, my galley, once again,\r\n   Cleaving the billows of the spacious deep,\r\n   Had reach’d the Ææan isle.”[22]\r\n\r\nHe does not, however, mean the whole, but the flow of the river in the\r\nocean, which forms but a part of the ocean. Crates says, he speaks of\r\nan estuary or gulf, extending from the winter tropic towards the south\r\npole.[23] Now any one quitting this, might still be in the ocean; but\r\nfor a person to leave the whole and still to be in the whole, is an\r\nimpossibility. But Homer says, that leaving the flow of the river, the\r\nship entered on the waves of the sea, which is the same as the ocean. If\r\nyou take it otherwise you make him say, that departing from the ocean he\r\ncame to the ocean. But this requires further discussion.\r\n\r\n8. Perception and experience alike inform us, that the earth we inhabit\r\nis an island: since wherever men have approached the termination of the\r\nland, the sea, which we designate ocean, has been met with: and reason\r\nassures us of the similarity of those places which our senses have not\r\nbeen permitted to survey. For in the east[24] the land occupied by the\r\nIndians, and in the west by the Iberians and Maurusians,[25] is wholly\r\nencompassed [by water], and so is the greater part on the south[26] and\r\nnorth.[27] And as to what remains as yet unexplored by us, because\r\nnavigators, sailing from opposite points, have not hitherto fallen in\r\nwith each other, it is not much, as any one may see who will compare the\r\ndistances between those places with which we are already acquainted. Nor\r\nis it likely that the Atlantic Ocean is divided into two seas by narrow\r\nisthmuses so placed as to prevent circumnavigation: how much more\r\nprobable that it is confluent and uninterrupted! Those who have returned\r\nfrom an attempt to circumnavigate the earth, do not say they have been\r\nprevented from continuing their voyage by any opposing continent, for\r\nthe sea remained perfectly open, but through want of resolution, and the\r\nscarcity of provision. This theory too accords better with the ebb and\r\nflow of the ocean, for the phenomenon, both in the increase and\r\ndiminution, is every where identical, or at all events has but little\r\ndifference, as if produced by the agitation of one sea, and resulting\r\nfrom one cause.\r\n\r\n9. We must not credit Hipparchus, who combats this opinion, denying that\r\nthe ocean is every where similarly affected; or that even if it were, it\r\nwould not follow that the Atlantic flowed in a circle, and thus\r\ncontinually returned into itself. Seleucus, the Babylonian, is his\r\nauthority for this assertion. For a further investigation of the ocean\r\nand its tides we refer to Posidonius and Athenodorus, who have fully\r\ndiscussed this subject: we will now only remark that this view agrees\r\nbetter with the uniformity of the phenomenon; and that the greater the\r\namount of moisture surrounding the earth, the easier would the heavenly\r\nbodies be supplied with vapours from thence.\r\n\r\n10. Homer, besides the boundaries of the earth, which he fully\r\ndescribes, was likewise well acquainted with the Mediterranean. Starting\r\nfrom the Pillars,[28] this sea is encompassed by Libya, Egypt, and\r\nPhœnicia, then by the coasts opposite Cyprus, the Solymi,[29] Lycia, and\r\nCaria, and then by the shore which stretches between Mycale[30] and\r\nTroas, and the adjacent islands, every one of which he mentions, as well\r\nas those of the Propontis[31] and the Euxine, as far as Colchis, and the\r\nlocality of Jason’s expedition. Furthermore, he was acquainted with the\r\nCimmerian Bosphorus,[32] having known the Cimmerians,[33] and that not\r\nmerely by name, but as being familiar with themselves. About his time,\r\nor a little before, they had ravaged the whole country, from the\r\nBosphorus to Ionia. Their climate he characterizes as dismal, in the\r\nfollowing lines:—\r\n\r\n   “With clouds and darkness veil’d, on whom the sun\r\n   Deigns not to look with his beam-darting eye,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   But sad night canopies the woeful race.”[34]\r\n\r\nHe must also have been acquainted with the Ister,[35] since he speaks of\r\nthe Mysians, a Thracian race, dwelling on the banks of the Ister. He\r\nknew also the whole Thracian[36] coast adjacent thereto, as far as the\r\nPeneus,[37] for he mentions individually the Pæonians, Athos, the\r\nAxius,[38] and the neighbouring islands. From hence to Thesprotis[39] is\r\nthe Grecian shore, with the whole of which he was acquainted. He was\r\nbesides familiar with the whole of Italy, and speaks of Temese[40] and\r\nthe Sicilians, as well as the whole of Spain[41] and its fertility, as\r\nwe have said before. If he omits various intermediate places this must\r\nbe pardoned, for even the compiler of a Geography overlooks numerous\r\ndetails. We must forgive him too for intermingling fabulous narrative\r\nwith his historical and instructive work. This should not be complained\r\nof; nevertheless, what Eratosthenes says is false, that the poets aim at\r\namusement, not instruction, since those who have treated upon the\r\nsubject most profoundly, regard poesy in the light of a primitive\r\nphilosophy. But we shall refute Eratosthenes[42] more at length, when we\r\nhave occasion again to speak of Homer.\r\n\r\n11. What we have already advanced is sufficient to prove that poet the\r\nfather of geography. Those who followed in his track are also well\r\nknown as great men and true philosophers. The two immediately succeeding\r\nHomer, according to Eratosthenes, were Anaximander, the disciple and\r\nfellow-citizen of Thales, and Hecatæus the Milesian. Anaximander was\r\nthe first to publish a geographical chart. Hecatæus left a work [on the\r\nsame subject], which we can identify as his by means of his other\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n12. Many have testified to the amount of knowledge which this subject\r\nrequires, and Hipparchus, in his Strictures on Eratosthenes, well\r\nobserves, “that no one can become really proficient in geography, either\r\nas a private individual or as a professor, without an acquaintance with\r\nastronomy, and a knowledge of eclipses. For instance, no one could tell\r\nwhether Alexandria in Egypt were north or south of Babylon, nor yet the\r\nintervening distance, without observing the latitudes.[43] Again, the\r\nonly means we possess of becoming acquainted with the longitudes of\r\ndifferent places is afforded by the eclipses of the sun and moon.” Such\r\nare the very words of Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n13. Every one who undertakes to give an accurate description of a place,\r\nshould be particular to add its astronomical and geometrical relations,\r\nexplaining carefully its extent, distance, degrees of latitude, and\r\n“climate.”[44] Even a builder before constructing a house, or an\r\narchitect before laying out a city, would take these things into\r\nconsideration; much more should he who examines the whole earth: for\r\nsuch things in a peculiar manner belong to him. In small distances a\r\nlittle deviation north or south does not signify, but when it is the\r\nwhole circle of the earth, the north extends to the furthest confines of\r\nScythia,[45] or Keltica,[46] and the south to the extremities of\r\nEthiopia: there is a wide difference here. The case is the same should\r\nwe inhabit India or Spain, one in the east, the other far west, and, as\r\nwe are aware, the antipodes[47] to each other.\r\n\r\n14. The [motions] of the sun and stars, and the centripetal force meet\r\nus on the very threshold of such subjects, and compel us to the study of\r\nastronomy, and the observation of such phenomena as each of us may\r\nnotice; in which too, very considerable differences appear, according to\r\nthe various points of observation. How could any one undertake to write\r\naccurately and with propriety on the differences of the various parts of\r\nthe earth, who was ignorant of these matters? and although, if the\r\nundertaking were of a popular character, it might not be advisable to\r\nenter thoroughly into detail, still we should endeavour to include every\r\nthing which could be comprehended by the general reader.\r\n\r\n15. He who has thus elevated his mind, will he be satisfied with any\r\nthing less than the whole world? If in his anxiety accurately to portray\r\nthe inhabited earth, he has dared to survey heaven, and make use thereof\r\nfor purposes of instruction, would it not seem childish were he to\r\nrefrain from examining the whole earth, of which the inhabited is but a\r\npart, its size, its features, and its position in the universe; whether\r\nother portions are inhabited besides those on which we dwell, and if so,\r\ntheir amount? What is the extent of the regions not peopled? what their\r\npeculiarities, and the cause of their remaining as they are? Thus it\r\nappears that the knowledge of geography is connected with\r\nmeteorology[48] and geometry, that it unites the things of earth to the\r\nthings of heaven, as though they were nearly allied, and not separated.\r\n\r\n   “As far as heaven from earth.”[49]\r\n\r\n16. To the various subjects which it embraces let us add natural\r\nhistory, or the history of the animals, plants, and other different\r\nproductions of the earth and sea, whether serviceable or useless, and my\r\noriginal statement will, I think, carry perfect conviction with it.\r\n\r\nThat he who should undertake this work would be a benefactor to mankind,\r\nreason and the voice of antiquity agree. The poets feign that they were\r\nthe wisest heroes who travelled and wandered most in foreign climes: and\r\nto be familiar with many countries, and the disposition of the\r\ninhabitants, is, according to them, of vast importance. Nestor prides\r\nhimself on having associated with the Lapithæ,[50] to whom he went,\r\n“having been invited thither from the Apian[51] land afar.”\r\n\r\nSo does Menelaus:—\r\n\r\n   “Cyprus, Phœnicia, Sidon, and the shores\r\n   Of Egypt, roaming without hope I reach’d;\r\n   In distant Ethiopia thence arrived,\r\n   And Libya, where the lambs their foreheads show\r\n   With budding horns defended soon as yean’d.”[52]\r\n\r\nAdding as a peculiarity of the country,\r\n\r\n   “There thrice within the year the flocks produce.”[53]\r\n\r\nAnd of Egypt:—“Where the sustaining earth is most prolific.”[54] And\r\nThebes,\r\n\r\n        “the city with an hundred gates,\r\n   Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war.”[55]\r\n\r\nSuch information greatly enlarges our sphere of knowledge, by informing\r\nus of the nature of the country, its botanical and zoological\r\npeculiarities. To these should be added its marine history; for we are\r\nin a certain sense amphibious, not exclusively connected with the land,\r\nbut with the sea as well. Hercules, on account of his vast experience\r\nand observation, was described as “skilled in mighty works.”[56]\r\n\r\nAll that we have previously stated is confirmed both by the testimony of\r\nantiquity and by reason. One consideration however appears to bear in a\r\npeculiar manner on the case in point; viz. the importance of geography\r\nin a political view. For the sea and the earth in which we dwell furnish\r\ntheatres for action; limited, for limited actions; vast, for grander\r\ndeeds; but that which contains them all, and is the scene of the\r\ngreatest undertakings, constitutes what we term the habitable earth; and\r\nthey are the greatest generals who, subduing nations and kingdoms under\r\none sceptre, and one political administration, have acquired dominion\r\nover land and sea. It is clear then, that geography is essential to all\r\nthe transactions of the statesman, informing us, as it does, of the\r\nposition of the continents, seas, and oceans of the whole habitable\r\nearth. Information of especial interest to those who are concerned to\r\nknow the exact truth of such particulars, and whether the places have\r\nbeen explored or not: for government will certainly be better\r\nadministered where the size and position of the country, its own\r\npeculiarities, and those of the surrounding districts, are understood.\r\nForasmuch as there are many sovereigns who rule in different regions,\r\nand some stretch their dominion over others’ territories, and undertake\r\nthe government of different nations and kingdoms, and thus enlarge the\r\nextent of their dominion, it is not possible that either themselves, nor\r\nyet writers on geography, should be equally acquainted with the whole,\r\nbut to both there is a great deal more or less known. Indeed, were the\r\nwhole earth under one government and one administration, it is hardly\r\npossible that we should be informed of every locality in an equal\r\ndegree; for even then we should be most acquainted with the places\r\nnearest us: and after all, it is better that we should have a more\r\nperfect description of these, since, on account of their proximity,\r\nthere is greater need for it. We see there is no reason to be surprised\r\nthat there should be one chorographer[57] for the Indians, another for\r\nthe Ethiopians, and a third for the Greeks and Romans. What use would it\r\nbe to the Indians if a geographer should thus describe Bœotia to them,\r\nin the words of Homer:—\r\n\r\n             “The dwellers on the rocks\r\n   Of Aulis follow’d, with the hardy clans\r\n   Of Hyria, Schœnus, Scolus.”[58]\r\n\r\nTo us this is of value, while to be acquainted with the Indies and\r\ntheir various territorial divisions would be useless, as it could lead\r\nto no advantage, which is the only criterion of the worth of such\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n17. Even if we descend to the consideration of such trivial matters as\r\nhunting, the case is still the same; for he will be most successful in\r\nthe chase who is acquainted with the size and nature of the wood, and\r\none familiar with the locality will be the most competent to superintend\r\nan encampment, an ambush, or a march. But it is in great undertakings\r\nthat the truth shines out in all its brilliancy, for here, while the\r\nsuccess resulting from knowledge is grand, the consequences of ignorance\r\nare disastrous. The fleet of Agamemnon, for instance, ravaging Mysia, as\r\nif it had been the Trojan territory, was compelled to a shameful\r\nretreat. Likewise the Persians and Libyans,[59] supposing certain\r\nstraits to be impassable, were very near falling into great perils, and\r\nhave left behind them memorials of their ignorance; the former a\r\nmonument to Salganeus on the Euripus, near Chalcis, whom the Persians\r\nslew, for, as they thought, falsely conducting their fleet from the Gulf\r\nof Malea[60] to the Euripus; and the latter to the memory of Pelorus,\r\nwho was executed on a like occasion. At the time of the expedition of\r\nXerxes, the coasts of Greece were covered with wrecks, and the\r\nemigrations from Æolia and Ionia furnish numerous instances of the same\r\ncalamity. On the other hand, matters have come to a prosperous\r\ntermination, when judiciously directed by a knowledge of the locality.\r\nThus it was at the pass of Thermopylæ that Ephialtes is reported to have\r\npointed out to the Persians a pathway over the mountains, and so placed\r\nthe band of Leonidas at their mercy, and opened to the Barbarians a\r\npassage into Pylæ. But passing over ancient occurrences, we think that\r\nthe late expeditions of the Romans against the Parthians furnish an\r\nexcellent example, where, as in those against the Germans and Kelts, the\r\nBarbarians, taking advantage of their situation, [carried on the war] in\r\nmarshes, woods, and pathless deserts, deceiving the ignorant enemy as to\r\nthe position of different places, and concealing the roads, and the\r\nmeans of obtaining food and necessaries.\r\n\r\n18. As we have said, this science has an especial reference to the\r\noccupations and requirements of statesmen, with whom also political and\r\nethical philosophy is mainly concerned; and here is an evidence. We\r\ndistinguish the different kinds of civil government by the office of\r\ntheir chief men, denominating one government a monarchy, or kingdom,\r\nanother an aristocracy, a third a democracy; for so many we consider are\r\nthe forms of government, and we designate them by these names, because\r\nfrom them they derive their primary characteristic. For the laws which\r\nemanate from the sovereign, from the aristocracy, and from the people\r\nall are different. The law is in fact a type of the form of government.\r\nIt is on this account that some define right to be the interest of the\r\nstrongest. If, therefore, political philosophy is advantageous to the\r\nruler, and geography in the actual government of the country, this\r\nlatter seems to possess some little superiority. This superiority is\r\nmost observable in real service.\r\n\r\n19. But even the theoretical portion of geography is by no means\r\ncontemptible. On the one hand, it embraces the arts, mathematics, and\r\nnatural science; on the other, history and fable. Not that this latter\r\ncan have any distinct advantage: for instance, if any one should relate\r\nto us the wanderings of Ulysses, Menelaus, and Jason, he would not seem\r\nto have added directly to our fund of practical knowledge thereby,\r\n(which is the only thing men of the world are interested in,) unless he\r\nshould convey useful examples of what those wanderers were compelled to\r\nsuffer, and at the same time afford matter of rational amusement to\r\nthose who interest themselves in the places which gave birth to such\r\nfables. Practical men interest themselves in these pursuits, since they\r\nare at once commendable, and afford them pleasure; but yet not to any\r\ngreat extent. In this class, too, will be found those whose main object\r\nin life is pleasure and respectability: but these by no means\r\nconstitute the majority of mankind, who naturally prefer that which\r\nholds out some direct advantage. The geographer should therefore chiefly\r\ndevote himself to what is practically important. He should follow the\r\nsame rule in regard to history and the mathematics, selecting always\r\nthat which is most useful, most intelligible, and most authentic.\r\n\r\n20. Geometry and astronomy, as we before remarked, seem absolutely\r\nindispensable in this science. This, in fact, is evident, that without\r\nsome such assistance, it would be impossible to be accurately acquainted\r\nwith the configuration of the earth; its climata,[61] dimensions, and\r\nthe like information.\r\n\r\nAs the size of the earth has been demonstrated by other writers, we\r\nshall here take for granted and receive as accurate what they have\r\nadvanced. We shall also assume that the earth is spheroidal, that its\r\nsurface is likewise spheroidal, and above all, that bodies have a\r\ntendency towards its centre, which latter point is clear to the\r\nperception of the most average understanding. However we may show\r\nsummarily that the earth is spheroidal, from the consideration that all\r\nthings however distant tend to its centre, and that every body is\r\nattracted towards its centre of gravity; this is more distinctly proved\r\nfrom observations of the sea and sky, for here the evidence of the\r\nsenses, and common observation, is alone requisite. The convexity of the\r\nsea is a further proof of this to those who have sailed; for they cannot\r\nperceive lights at a distance when placed at the same level as their\r\neyes, but if raised on high, they at once become perceptible to vision,\r\nthough at the same time further removed. So, when the eye is raised, it\r\nsees what before was utterly imperceptible. Homer speaks of this when he\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n   Lifted up on the vast wave he quickly beheld afar.[62]\r\n\r\nSailors, as they approach their destination, behold the shore\r\ncontinually raising itself to their view; and objects which had at first\r\nseemed low, begin to elevate themselves. Our gnomons, also, are, among\r\nother things, evidence of the revolution of the heavenly bodies; and\r\ncommon sense at once shows us, that if the depth of the earth were\r\ninfinite,[63] such a revolution could not take place.\r\n\r\nEvery information respecting the climata[64] is contained in the\r\n“Treatises on Positions.”[65]\r\n\r\n21. Now there are some facts which we take to be established, viz. those\r\nwith which every politician and general should be familiar. For on no\r\naccount should they be so uninformed as to the heavens and the position\r\nof the earth,[66] that when they are in strange countries, where some of\r\nthe heavenly phenomena wear a different aspect to what they have been\r\naccustomed, they should be in a consternation, and exclaim,\r\n\r\n                     “Neither west\r\n   Know we, nor east, where rises or where sets\r\n   The all-enlightening sun.”[67]\r\n\r\nStill, we do not expect that they should be such thorough masters of the\r\nsubject as to know what stars rise and set together for the different\r\nquarters of the earth; those which have the same meridian line, the\r\nelevation of the poles, the signs which are in the zenith, with all the\r\nvarious phenomena which differ as well in appearance as reality with the\r\nvariations of the horizon and arctic circle. With some of these matters,\r\nunless as philosophical pursuits, they should not burden themselves at\r\nall; others they must take for granted without searching into their\r\ncauses. This must be left to the care of the philosopher; the statesman\r\ncan have no leisure, or very little, for such pursuits. Those who,\r\nthrough carelessness and ignorance, are not familiar with the globe and\r\nthe circles traced upon it, some parallel to each other, some at right\r\nangles to the former, others, again, in an oblique direction; nor yet\r\nwith the position of the tropics, equator, and zodiac, (that circle\r\nthrough which the sun travels in his course, and by which we reckon the\r\nchanges of season and the winds,) such persons we caution against the\r\nperusal of our work. For if a man is neither properly acquainted with\r\nthese things, nor with the variations of the horizon and arctic circle,\r\nand such similar elements of mathematics, how can he comprehend the\r\nmatters treated of here? So for one who does not know a right line from\r\na curve, nor yet a circle, nor a plane or spherical surface, nor the\r\nseven stars in the firmament composing the Great Bear, and such like,\r\nour work is entirely useless, at least for the present. Unless he first\r\nacquires such information, he is utterly incompetent to the study of\r\ngeography. *So those who have written the works entitled “On Ports,” and\r\n“Voyages Around the World,” have performed their task imperfectly, since\r\nthey have omitted to supply the requisite information from mathematics\r\nand astronomy.*[68]\r\n\r\n22. The present undertaking is composed in a lucid style, suitable alike\r\nto the statesman and the general reader, after the fashion of my\r\nHistory.[69] By a statesman we do not intend an illiterate person, but\r\none who has gone through the course of a liberal and philosophical\r\neducation. For a man who has bestowed no attention on virtue or\r\nintelligence, nor what constitutes them, must be incompetent either to\r\nblame or praise, still less to decide what actions are worthy to be\r\nplaced on record.\r\n\r\n23. Having already compiled our Historical Memoirs, which, as we\r\nconceive, are a valuable addition both to political and moral\r\nphilosophy, we have now determined to follow it up with the present\r\nwork, which has been prepared on the same system as the former, and for\r\nthe same class of readers, but more particularly for those who are in\r\nhigh stations of life. And as our former production contains only the\r\nmost striking events in the lives of distinguished men, omitting\r\ntrifling and unimportant incidents; so here it will be proper to dismiss\r\nsmall and doubtful particulars, and merely call attention to great and\r\nremarkable transactions, such in fact as are useful, memorable, and\r\nentertaining. In the colossal works of the sculptor we do not descend\r\ninto a minute examination of particulars, but look principally for\r\nperfection in the general _ensemble_. This is the only method of\r\ncriticism applicable to the present work. Its proportions, so to speak,\r\nare colossal; it deals in the generalities and main outlines of things,\r\nexcept now and then, when some minor detail can be selected, calculated\r\nto be serviceable to the seeker after knowledge, or the man of business.\r\n\r\nWe now think we have demonstrated that our present undertaking is one\r\nthat requires great care, and is well worthy of a philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. No one can [justly] blame us for having undertaken to write on a\r\nsubject already often treated of, unless it appears that we have done\r\nnothing more than copy the works of former writers. In our opinion,\r\nthough they may have perfectly treated some subjects, in others they\r\nhave still left much to be completed; and we shall be justified in our\r\nperformance, if we can add to their information even in a trifling\r\ndegree. At the present moment the conquests of the Romans and Parthians\r\nhave added much to our knowledge, which (as was well observed by\r\nEratosthenes) had been considerably increased by the expedition of\r\nAlexander. This prince laid open to our view the greater part of Asia,\r\nand the whole north of Europe as far as the Danube. And the Romans [have\r\ndiscovered to us] the entire west of Europe as far as the river Elbe,\r\nwhich divides Germany, and the country beyond the Ister to the river\r\nDniester. The country beyond this to the Mæotis,[70] and the coasts\r\nextending along Colchis,[71] was brought to light by Mithridates,\r\nsurnamed Eupator, and his generals. To the Parthians we are indebted for\r\na better acquaintance with Hyrcania,[72] Bactriana,[73] and the land of\r\nthe Scythians[74] lying beyond, of which before we knew but little. Thus\r\nwe can add much information not supplied by former writers, but this\r\nwill best be seen when we come to treat on the writers who have preceded\r\nus; and this method we shall pursue, not so much in regard to the\r\nprimitive geographers, as to Eratosthenes and those subsequent to him.\r\nAs these writers far surpassed the generality in the amount of their\r\nknowledge, so naturally it is more difficult to detect their errors when\r\nsuch occur. If I seem to contradict those most whom I take chiefly for\r\nmy guides, I must claim indulgence on the plea, that it was never\r\nintended to criticise the whole body of geographers, the larger number\r\nof whom are not worthy of consideration, but to give an opinion of those\r\nonly who are generally found correct. Still, while many are beneath\r\ndiscussion, such men as Eratosthenes, Posidonius, Hipparchus, Polybius,\r\nand others of their stamp, deserve our highest consideration.\r\n\r\n2. Let us first examine Eratosthenes, reviewing at the same time what\r\nHipparchus has advanced against him. Eratosthenes is much too creditable\r\nan historian for us to believe what Polemon endeavours to charge against\r\nhim, that he had not even seen Athens. At the same time he does not\r\nmerit that unbounded confidence which some seem to repose in him,\r\nalthough, as he himself tells us, he passed much of his time with\r\nfirst-rate [characters]. Never, says he, at one period, and in one city,\r\nwere there so many philosophers flourishing together as in my time. In\r\ntheir number was Ariston and Arcesilaus. This, however, it seems is not\r\nsufficient, but you must also be able to choose who are the real guides\r\nwhom it is your interest to follow. He considers Arcesilaus and Ariston\r\nto be the coryphæi of the philosophers who flourished in his time, and\r\nis ceaseless in his eulogies of Apelles and Bion, the latter of whom,\r\nsays he, was the first to deck himself in the flowers of philosophy, but\r\nconcerning whom one is often likewise tempted to exclaim, “How great is\r\nBion in spite of his rags!”[75] It is in such instances as the following\r\nthat the mediocrity of his genius shows itself.\r\n\r\nAlthough at Athens he became a disciple of Zeno[76] of Citium, he makes\r\nno mention of his followers; while those who opposed that philosopher,\r\nand of whose sect not a trace remains, he thinks fit to set down amongst\r\nthe [great characters] who flourished in his time. His real character\r\nappears in his Treatise on Moral Philosophy,[77] his Meditations, and\r\nsome similar productions. He seems to have held a middle course between\r\nthe man who devotes himself to philosophy, and the man who cannot make\r\nup his mind to dedicate himself to it: and to have studied the science\r\nmerely as a relief from his other pursuits, or as a pleasing and\r\ninstructive recreation. In his other writings he is just the same; but\r\nlet these things pass. We will now proceed as well as we can to the task\r\nof rectifying his geography.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, let us return to the point which we lately deferred.\r\n\r\n3. Eratosthenes says that the poet directs his whole attention to the\r\namusement of the mind, and not at all to its instruction. In opposition\r\nto his idea, the ancients define poesy as a primitive philosophy,\r\nguiding our life from infancy, and pleasantly regulating our morals, our\r\ntastes, and our actions. The [Stoics] of our day affirm that the only\r\nwise man is the poet. On this account the earliest lessons which the\r\ncitizens of Greece convey to their children are from the poets;\r\ncertainly not alone for the purpose of amusing their minds, but for\r\ntheir instruction. Nay, even the professors of music, who give lessons\r\non the harp, lyre, and pipe, lay claim to our consideration on the same\r\naccount, since they say that [the accomplishments which they teach] are\r\ncalculated to form and improve the character. It is not only among the\r\nPythagoreans that one hears this claim supported, for Aristoxenus is of\r\nthat opinion, and Homer too regarded the bards as amongst the wisest of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nOf this number was the guardian of Clytemnestra, “to whom the son of\r\nAtreus, when he set out for Troy, gave earnest charge to preserve his\r\nwife,”[78] whom Ægisthus was unable to seduce, until “leading the bard\r\nto a desert island, he left him,”[79] and then\r\n\r\n   “The queen he led, not willing less than he,\r\n   To his own mansion.”[80]\r\n\r\nBut apart from all such considerations, Eratosthenes contradicts\r\nhimself; for a little previously to the sentence which we have quoted,\r\nat the commencement of his Essay on Geography, he says, that “all the\r\nancient poets took delight in showing their knowledge of such matters.\r\nHomer inserted into his poetry all that he knew about the Ethiopians,\r\nEgypt, and Libya. Of all that related to Greece and the neighbouring\r\nplaces he entered even too minutely into the details, describing Thisbe\r\nas “abounding in doves,” Haliartus, “grassy,” Anthedon, the “far\r\ndistant,” Litæa, “situated on the sources of the Cephissus,”[81] and\r\nnone of his epithets are without their meaning. But in pursuing this\r\nmethod, what object has he in view, to amuse [merely], or to instruct?\r\nThe latter, doubtless. Well, perhaps he has told the truth in these\r\ninstances, but in what was beyond his observation both he and the other\r\nwriters have indulged in all the marvels of fable. If such be the case\r\nthe statement should have been, that the poets relate some things for\r\nmere amusement, others for instruction; but he affirms that they do it\r\naltogether for amusement, without any view to information; and by way of\r\nclimax, inquires, What can it add to Homer’s worth to be familiar with\r\nmany lands, and skilled in strategy, agriculture, rhetoric, and similar\r\ninformation, which some persons seem desirous to make him possessed of.\r\nTo seek to invest him with all this knowledge is most likely the effect\r\nof too great a zeal for his honour. Hipparchus observes, that to assert\r\nhe was acquainted with every art and science, is like saying that an\r\nAttic eiresionè[82] bears pears and apples.\r\n\r\nAs far as this goes, Eratosthenes, you are right enough; not so,\r\nhowever, when you not only deny that Homer was possessed of these vast\r\nacquirements, but represent poetry in general as a tissue of old wives’\r\nfables, where, to use your own expression, every thing thought likely to\r\namuse is cooked up. I ask, is it of no value to the auditors[83] of the\r\npoets to be made acquainted with [the history of] different countries,\r\nwith strategy, agriculture, and rhetoric, and such-like things, which\r\nthe lecture generally contains.\r\n\r\n4. One thing is certain, that the poet has bestowed all these gifts upon\r\nUlysses, whom beyond any of his other [heroes] he loves to adorn with\r\nevery virtue. He says of him, that he\r\n\r\n   “Discover’d various cities, and the mind\r\n   And manners learn’d of men in lands remote.”[84]\r\n\r\nThat he was\r\n\r\n   “Of a piercing wit and deeply wise.”[85]\r\n\r\nHe is continually described as “the destroyer of cities,” and as having\r\nvanquished Troy, by his counsels, his advice, and his deceptive art.\r\nDiomede says of him,\r\n\r\n   “Let him attend me, and through fire itself\r\n   We shall return; for none is wise as he.”[86]\r\n\r\nHe prides himself on his skill in husbandry, for at the harvest [he\r\nsays],\r\n\r\n   “I with my well-bent sickle in my hand,\r\n   Thou arm’d with one as keen.”[87]\r\n\r\nAnd also in tillage,\r\n\r\n                         “Then shouldst thou see\r\n   How straight my furrow should be cut and true.”[88]\r\n\r\nAnd Homer was not singular in his opinion regarding these matters, for\r\nall educated people appeal to him in favour of the idea that such\r\npractical knowledge is one of the chief means of acquiring\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n5. That eloquence is regarded as the wisdom of speech, Ulysses manifests\r\nthroughout the whole poem, both in the Trial,[89] the Petitions,[90] and\r\nthe Embassy.[91] Of him it is said by Antenor,\r\n\r\n   “But when he spake, forth from his breast did flow\r\n   A torrent swift as winter’s feather’d snow.”[92]\r\n\r\nWho can suppose that a poet capable of effectively introducing into his\r\nscenes rhetoricians, generals, and various other characters, each\r\ndisplaying some peculiar excellence, was nothing more than a droll or\r\njuggler, capable only of cheating or flattering his hearer, and not of\r\ninstructing him.\r\n\r\nAre we not all agreed that the chief merit of a poet consists in his\r\naccurate representation of the affairs of life? Can this be done by a\r\nmere driveller, unacquainted with the world?\r\n\r\nThe excellence of a poet is not to be measured by the same standard as\r\nthat of a mechanic or a blacksmith, where honour and virtue have nothing\r\nto do with our estimate. But the poet and the individual are connected,\r\nand he only can become a good poet, who is in the first instance a\r\nworthy man.\r\n\r\n6. To deny that our poet possesses the graces of oratory is using us\r\nhardly indeed. What is so befitting an orator, what so poetical as\r\neloquence, and who so sweetly eloquent as Homer? But, by heaven! you’ll\r\nsay, there are other styles of eloquence than those peculiar to poetry.\r\nOf course [I admit this]; in poetry itself there is the tragic and the\r\ncomic style; in prose, the historic and the forensic. But is not\r\nlanguage a generality, of which poetry and prose are forms? Yes,\r\nlanguage is; but are not the rhetorical, the eloquent, and the florid\r\nstyles also? I answer, that flowery prose is nothing but an imitation of\r\npoetry. Ornate poetry was the first to make its appearance, and was well\r\nreceived. Afterwards it was closely imitated by writers in the time of\r\nCadmus, Pherecydes, and Hecatæus. The metre was the only thing dispensed\r\nwith, every other poetic grace being carefully preserved. As time\r\nadvanced, one after another of its beauties was discarded, till at last\r\nit came down from its glory into our common prose. In the same way we\r\nmay say that comedy took its rise from tragedy, but descended from its\r\nlofty grandeur into what we now call the common parlance of daily life.\r\nAnd when [we find] the ancient writers making use of the expression “to\r\nsing,” to designate eloquence of style, this in itself is an evidence\r\nthat poetry is the source and origin of all ornamented and rhetorical\r\nlanguage. Poetry in ancient days was on every occasion accompanied by\r\nmelody. The song or ode was but a modulated speech, from whence the\r\nwords rhapsody, tragedy, comedy,[93] are derived; and since originally\r\neloquence was the term made use of for the poetical effusions which were\r\nalways of the nature of a song, it soon happened [that in speaking of\r\npoetry] some said, to sing, others, to be eloquent; and as the one term\r\nwas early misapplied to prose compositions, the other also was soon\r\napplied in the same way. Lastly, the very term _prose_, which is applied\r\nto language not clothed in metre, seems to indicate, as it were, its\r\ndescent from an elevation or chariot to the ground.[94]\r\n\r\n7. Homer accurately describes many distant countries, and not only\r\nGreece and the neighbouring places, as Eratosthenes asserts. His\r\nromance, too, is in better style than that of his successors. He does\r\nnot make up wondrous tales on every occasion, but to instruct us the\r\nbetter often, and especially in the Odyssey, adds to the circumstances\r\nwhich have come under his actual observation, allegories, wise\r\nharangues, and enticing narrations. Concerning which, Eratosthenes is\r\nmuch mistaken when he says that both Homer and his commentators are a\r\npack of fools. But this subject demands a little more of our attention.\r\n\r\n8. To begin. The poets were by no means the first to avail themselves of\r\nmyths. States and lawgivers had taken advantage of them long before,\r\nhaving observed the constitutional bias of mankind. Man is eager after\r\nknowledge, and the love of legend is but the prelude thereto. This is\r\nwhy children begin to listen [to fables], and are acquainted with them\r\nbefore any other kind of knowledge; the cause of this is that the myth\r\nintroduces them to a new train of ideas, relating not to every-day\r\noccurrences, but something in addition to these.\r\n\r\nA charm hangs round whatever is new and hitherto unknown, inspiring us\r\nwith a desire to become acquainted with it, but when the wonderful and\r\nthe marvellous are likewise present, our delight is increased until at\r\nlast it becomes a philtre of study. To children we are obliged to hold\r\nout such enticements, in order that in riper years, when the mind is\r\npowerful, and no longer needs such stimulants, it may be prepared to\r\nenter on the study of actual realities.\r\n\r\nEvery illiterate and uninstructed man is yet a child, and takes delight\r\nin fable. With the partially informed it is much the same; reason is not\r\nall-powerful within him, and he still possesses the tastes of a child.\r\nBut the marvellous, which is capable of exciting fear as well as\r\npleasure, influences not childhood only, but age as well. As we relate\r\nto children pleasing tales to incite them [to any course] of action, and\r\nfrightful ones to deter them, such as those of Lamia,[95] Gorgo,[96]\r\nEphialtes,[97] and Mormolyca.[98] So numbers of our citizens are\r\nincited to deeds of virtue by the beauties of fable, when they hear the\r\npoets in a strain of enthusiasm recording noble actions, such as the\r\nlabours of Hercules or Theseus, and the honours bestowed on them by the\r\ngods, or even when they see paintings, sculptures, or figures bearing\r\ntheir romantic evidence to such events. In the same way they are\r\nrestrained from vicious courses, when they think they have received from\r\nthe gods by oracles or some other invisible intimations, threats,\r\nmenaces, or chastisements, or even if they only believe they have\r\nbefallen others. The great mass of women and common people, cannot be\r\ninduced by mere force of reason to devote themselves to piety, virtue,\r\nand honesty; superstition must therefore be employed, and even this is\r\ninsufficient without the aid of the marvellous and the terrible. For\r\nwhat are the thunderbolts, the ægis, the trident, the torches, the\r\ndragons, the barbed thyrses, the arms of the gods, and all the\r\nparaphernalia of antique theology, but fables employed by the founders\r\nof states, as bugbears to frighten timorous minds.\r\n\r\nSuch was mythology; and when our ancestors found it capable of\r\nsubserving the purposes of social and political life, and even\r\ncontributing to the knowledge of truth, they continued the education of\r\nchildhood to maturer years, and maintained that poetry was sufficient to\r\nform the understanding of every age. In course of time history and our\r\npresent philosophy were introduced; these, however, suffice but for the\r\nchosen few, and to the present day poetry is the main agent which\r\ninstructs our people and crowds our theatres. Homer here stands\r\npre-eminent, but in truth all the early historians and natural\r\nphilosophers were mythologists as well.\r\n\r\n9. Thus it is that our poet, though he sometimes employs fiction for the\r\npurposes of instruction, always gives the preference to truth; he makes\r\nuse of what is false, merely tolerating it in order the more easily to\r\nlead and govern the multitude. As a man\r\n\r\n               “Binds with a golden verge\r\n   Bright silver:”[99]\r\n\r\nso Homer, heightening by fiction actual occurrences, adorns and\r\nembellishes his subject; but his end is always the same as that of the\r\nhistorian, who relates nothing but facts. In this manner he undertook\r\nthe narration of the Trojan war, gilding it with the beauties of fancy\r\nand the wanderings of Ulysses; but we shall never find Homer inventing\r\nan empty fable apart from the inculcation of truth. It is ever the case\r\nthat a person lies most successfully, when he intermingles [into the\r\nfalsehood] a sprinkling of truth. Such is the remark of Polybius in\r\ntreating of the wanderings of Ulysses; such is also the meaning of the\r\nverse,\r\n\r\n   “He fabricated many falsehoods, relating them like truths:”[100]\r\n\r\nnot _all_, but _many_ falsehoods, otherwise it would not have looked\r\nlike the truth. Homer’s narrative is founded on history. He tells us\r\nthat king Æolus governed the Lipari Islands, that around Mount Ætna and\r\nLeontini dwelt the Cyclopæ, and certain Læstrygonians inhospitable to\r\nstrangers. That at that time the districts surrounding the strait were\r\nunapproachable; and Scylla and Charybdis were infested by banditti. In\r\nlike manner in the writings of Homer we are informed of other\r\nfreebooters, who dwelt in divers regions. Being aware that the\r\nCimmerians dwelt on the Cimmerian Bosphorus, a dark northern country, he\r\nfelicitously locates them in a gloomy region close by Hades, a fit\r\ntheatre for the scene in the wanderings of Ulysses. That he was\r\nacquainted with these people we may satisfy ourselves from the\r\nchroniclers, who report an incursion made by the Cimmerians either\r\nduring his lifetime or just before.\r\n\r\n10. Being acquainted with Colchis, and the voyage of Jason to Æa, and\r\nalso with the historical and fabulous relations concerning Circe and\r\nMedea, their enchantments and their various other points of resemblance,\r\nhe feigns there was a relationship between them, notwithstanding the\r\nvast distance by which they were separated, the one dwelling in an\r\ninland creek of the Euxine, and the other in Italy, and both of them\r\nbeyond the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Jason himself wandered as far as Italy, for traces\r\nof the Argonautic expedition are pointed out near the Ceraunian[101]\r\nmountains, by the Adriatic,[102] at the Posidonian[103] Gulf and the\r\nisles adjacent to Tyrrhenia.[104] The Cyaneæ, called by some the\r\nSymplegades,[105] or Jostling Rocks, which render the passage through\r\nthe Strait of Constantinople so difficult, also afforded matter to our\r\npoet. The actual existence of a place named Æa, stamped credibility upon\r\nhis Ææa; so did the Symplegades upon the Planctæ, (the Jostling Rocks\r\nupon the Wandering Rocks,) and the passage of Jason through the midst of\r\nthem; in the same way Scylla and Charybdis accredited the passage [of\r\nUlysses] past those rocks. In his time people absolutely regarded the\r\nEuxine as a kind of second ocean, and placed those who had crossed it in\r\nthe same list with navigators who had passed the Pillars.[106] It was\r\nlooked upon as the largest of our seas, and was therefore _par\r\nexcellence_ styled the Sea, in the same way as Homer [is called] the\r\nPoet. In order therefore to be well received, it is probable he\r\ntransferred the scenes from the Euxine to the ocean, so as not to\r\nstagger the general belief. And in my opinion those Solymi who possess\r\nthe highest ridges of Taurus, lying between Lycia and Pisidia, and those\r\nwho in their southern heights stand out most conspicuously to the\r\ndwellers on this side Taurus, and the inhabitants of the Euxine by a\r\nfigure of speech, he describes as being beyond the ocean. For narrating\r\nthe voyage of Ulysses in his ship, he says,\r\n\r\n   “But Neptune, traversing in his return\r\n   From Ethiopia’s sons, the mountain heights\r\n   Of Solymè, descried him from afar.”[107]\r\n\r\nIt is probable he took his account of the one-eyed Cyclopæ from Scythian\r\nhistory, for the Arimaspi, whom Aristæus of Proconnesus describes in his\r\nTales of the Arimaspi, are said to be distinguished by this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n11. Having premised thus much, we must now take into consideration the\r\nreasons of those who assert that Homer makes Ulysses wander to Sicily\r\nor Italy, and also of those who denied this. The truth is, he may be\r\nequally interpreted on this subject either way, according as we take a\r\ncorrect or incorrect view of the case. Correct, if we understand that he\r\nwas convinced of the reality of Ulysses’ wanderings there, and taking\r\nthis truth as a foundation, raised thereon a poetical superstructure.\r\nAnd so far this description of him is right; for not about Italy only,\r\nbut to the farthest extremities of Spain, traces of his wanderings and\r\nthose of similar adventurers may still be found. Incorrect, if the\r\nscene-painting is received as fact, his Ocean, and Hades, the oxen of\r\nthe sun, his hospitable reception by the goddesses, the metamorphoses,\r\nthe gigantic size of the Cyclopæ and Læstrygonians, the monstrous\r\nappearance of Scylla, the distance of the voyage, and other similar\r\nparticulars, all alike manifestly fabulous. It is as idle to waste words\r\nwith a person who thus openly maligns our poet, as it would be with one\r\nwho should assert as true all the particulars of Ulysses’ return to\r\nIthaca,[108] the slaughter of the suitors, and the pitched battle\r\nbetween him and the Ithacans in the field. But nothing can be said\r\nagainst the man who understands the words of the poet in a rational way.\r\n\r\n12. Eratosthenes, though on no sufficient grounds for so doing, rejects\r\nboth these opinions, endeavouring in his attack on the latter, to refute\r\nby lengthened arguments what is manifestly absurd and unworthy of\r\nconsideration, and in regard to the former, maintaining a poet to be a\r\nmere gossip, to whose worth an acquaintance with science or geography\r\ncould not add in the least degree: since the scenes of certain of\r\nHomer’s fables are cast in actual localities, as Ilium,[109]\r\nPelion,[110] and Ida;[111] others in purely imaginary regions, such as\r\nthose of the Gorgons and Geryon. “Of this latter class,” he says, “are\r\nthe places mentioned in the wanderings of Ulysses, and those who pretend\r\nthat they are not mere fabrications of the poet, but have an actual\r\nexistence, are proved to be mistaken by the differences of opinion\r\nexisting among themselves: for some of them assert that the Sirenes of\r\nHomer are situated close to Pelorus,[112] and others that they are more\r\nthan two thousand stadia distant,[113] near the Sirenussæ,[114] a\r\nthree-peaked rock which separates the Gulfs of Cumæa and Posidonium.”\r\nNow, in the first place, this rock is not three-peaked, nor does it form\r\na crest at the summit at all, but a long and narrow angle reaching from\r\nthe territory of Surrentum[115] to the Strait of Capria,[116] having on\r\none side of the mountain the temple of the Sirens, and on the other\r\nside, next the Gulf of Posidonium, three little rocky and uninhabited\r\nislands, named the Sirenes; upon the strait, is situated the Athenæum,\r\nfrom which the rocky angle itself takes its name.\r\n\r\n13. Further, if those who describe the geography of certain places do\r\nnot agree in every particular, are we justified in at once rejecting\r\ntheir whole narration? Frequently this is a reason why it should receive\r\nthe greater credit. For example, in the investigation whether the scene\r\nof Ulysses’ wanderings were Sicily or Italy, and the proper position of\r\nthe Sirenes, they differ in so far that one places them at Pelorus, and\r\nthe other at Sirenussæ, but neither of them dissents from the idea that\r\nit was some where near Sicily or Italy. They add thereby strength to\r\nthis view, inasmuch as though they are not agreed as to the exact\r\nlocality, neither of them makes any question but that it was some where\r\ncontiguous to Italy or Sicily. If a third party should add, that the\r\nmonument of Parthenope, who was one of the Sirens, is shown at Naples,\r\nthis only confirms us the more in our belief, for though a third place\r\nis introduced to our notice, still as Naples is situated in the gulf\r\ncalled by Eratosthenes the Cumæan, and which is formed by the\r\nSirenussæ, we are more confident still that the position of the Sirenes\r\nwas some where close by.\r\n\r\nThat the poet did not search for accuracy in every minor detail we\r\nadmit, but neither ought we to expect this of him; at the same time we\r\nare not to believe that he composed his poem without inquiring into the\r\nhistory of the Wandering, nor where and how it occurred.\r\n\r\n14. Eratosthenes “thinks it probable that Hesiod, having heard of the\r\nwanderings of Ulysses, and of their having taken place near to Sicily\r\nand Italy, embraced this view of the case, and not only describes the\r\nplaces spoken of by Homer, but also Ætna, the Isle of Ortygia,[117] near\r\nto Syracuse, and Tyrrhenia. As for Homer, he was altogether unacquainted\r\nwith these places, and further, had no wish to lay the scene of the\r\nwanderings in any well-known locality.” What! are then Ætna and\r\nTyrrhenia such well-known places, and Scyllæum, Charybdis,\r\nCircæum,[118] and the Sirenussæ, so obscure? Or is Hesiod so correct as\r\nnever to write nonsense, but always follow in the wake of received\r\nopinions, while Homer blurts out whatever comes uppermost? Without\r\ntaking into consideration our remarks on the character and aptitude of\r\nHomer’s myths, a large array of writers who bear evidence to his\r\nstatements, and the additional testimony of local tradition, are\r\nsufficient proof that his are not the inventions of poets or\r\ncontemporary scribblers, but the record of real actors and real scenes.\r\n\r\n15. The conjecture of Polybius in regard to the particulars of the\r\nwandering of Ulysses is excellent. He says that Æolus instructed sailors\r\nhow to navigate the strait, a difficult matter on account of the\r\ncurrents occasioned by the ebb and flow, and was therefore called the\r\ndispenser of the winds, and reputed their king.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Danaus for pointing out the springs of water that were in\r\nArgos, and Atreus for showing the retrograde movement of the sun in the\r\nheavens, from being mere soothsayers and diviners, were raised to the\r\ndignity of kings. And the priests of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, and\r\nMagi, distinguished for their wisdom above those around them, obtained\r\nfrom our predecessors honour and authority; and so it is that in each\r\nof the gods, we worship the discoverer of some useful art.\r\n\r\nHaving thus introduced his subject, he does not allow us to consider the\r\naccount of Æolus, nor yet the rest of the Odyssey, as altogether\r\nmythical. There is a spice of the fabulous here, as well as in the\r\nTrojan War,[119] but as respects Sicily, the poet accords entirely with\r\nthe other historians who have written on the local traditions of Sicily\r\nand Italy. He altogether denies the justness of Eratosthenes’ dictum,\r\n“that we may hope to discover the whereabout of Ulysses’ wanderings,\r\nwhen we can find the cobbler who sewed up the winds in the leathern\r\nsack.” “And [adds Polybius] his description of the hunt of the\r\ngaleotes[120] at Scylla,\r\n\r\n   ‘Plunged to her middle in the horrid den\r\n   She lurks, protruding from the black abyss\r\n   Her heads, with which the ravening monster dives\r\n   In quest of dolphins, dog-fish, or of prey\r\n   More bulky,’[121]\r\n\r\naccords well with what takes place around Scyllæum: for the thunny-fish,\r\ncarried in shoals by Italy, and not being able to reach Sicily, fall\r\ninto [the Strait], where they become the prey of larger fish, such as\r\ndolphins, dog-fish, and other cetacea, and it is by this means that the\r\ngaleotes (which are also called sword-fish) and dogs fatten themselves.\r\nFor the same thing occurs here, and at the rising of the Nile and other\r\nrivers, as takes place when a forest is on fire. Vast crowds of animals,\r\nin flying from the fire or the water, become the prey of beasts more\r\npowerful than themselves.”\r\n\r\n16. He then goes on to describe the manner in which they catch the\r\nsword-fish at Scyllæum. One look-out directs the whole body of fishers,\r\nwho are in a vast number of small boats, each furnished with two oars,\r\nand two men to each boat. One man rows, the other stands on the prow,\r\nspear in hand, while the look-out has to signal the appearance of a\r\nsword-fish. (This fish, when swimming, has about a third of its body\r\nabove water.) As it passes the boat, the fisher darts the spear from his\r\nhand, and when this is withdrawn, it leaves the sharp point with which\r\nit is furnished sticking in the flesh of the fish: this point is\r\nbarbed, and loosely fixed to the spear for the purpose; it has a long\r\nend fastened to it; this they pay out to the wounded fish, till it is\r\nexhausted with its struggling and endeavours at escape. Afterwards they\r\ntrail it to the shore, or, unless it is too large and full-grown, haul\r\nit into the boat. If the spear should fall into the sea, it is not lost,\r\nfor it is jointed of oak and pine, so that when the oak sinks on account\r\nof its weight, it causes the other end to rise, and thus is easily\r\nrecovered. It sometimes happens that the rower is wounded, even through\r\nthe boat, and such is the size of the sword with which the galeote is\r\narmed, such the strength of the fish, and the method of the capture,\r\nthat [in danger] it is not surpassed by the chase of the wild boar. From\r\nthese facts (he says) we may conclude that Ulysses’ wanderings were\r\nclose to Sicily, since Homer describes Scylla[122] as engaging in a\r\npursuit exactly similar to that which is carried on at Scyllæum. As to\r\nCharybdis, he describes just what takes place at the Strait of Messina:\r\n\r\n   “Each day she _thrice_ disgorges,”[123]\r\n\r\ninstead of _twice_, being only a mistake, either of the scribe or the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\n17. The customs of the inhabitants of Meninx[124] closely correspond to\r\nthe description of the Lotophagi. If any thing does not correspond, it\r\nshould be attributed to change, or to misconception, or to poetical\r\nlicence, which is made up of history, rhetoric, and fiction. Truth is\r\nthe aim of the historical portion, as for instance in the Catalogue of\r\nShips,[125] where the poet informs us of the peculiarities of each\r\nplace, that one is rocky, another the furthest city, that this abounds\r\nin doves, and that is maritime. A lively interest is the end of the\r\nrhetorical, as when he points to us the combat; and of the fiction,\r\npleasure and astonishment. A mere fabrication would neither be\r\npersuasive nor Homeric; and we know that his poem is generally\r\nconsidered a scientific treatise, notwithstanding what Eratosthenes may\r\nsay, when he bids us not to judge poems by the standard of intellect,\r\nnor yet look to them for history.\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that the line\r\n\r\n   “Nine days by cruel storms thence was I borne\r\n   Athwart the fishy deep,”[126]\r\n\r\nshould be understood of merely a short distance, (for cruel storms do\r\nnot blow in a right course,) and not of being carried beyond the ocean,\r\nas if impelled by favourable winds. “And,” says Polybius, “allowing the\r\ndistance from Malea[127] to the Pillars to be 22,500 stadia, and\r\nsupposing the rate of passage was the same throughout the nine days, the\r\nvoyage must have been accomplished at the speed of 2500 stadia per diem:\r\nnow who has ever recorded that the passage from Lycia or Rhodes to\r\nAlexandria, a distance of 4000 stadia, has been made in two days? To\r\nthose who demand how it was that Ulysses, though he journeyed thrice to\r\nSicily, never once navigated the Strait, we reply that, long after his\r\ntime, voyagers always sedulously avoided that route.”\r\n\r\n18. Such are the sentiments of Polybius; and in many respects they are\r\ncorrect enough; but when he discusses the voyage beyond the ocean, and\r\nenters on minute calculations of the proportion borne by the distance to\r\nthe number of days, he is greatly mistaken. He alleges perpetually the\r\nwords of the poet,\r\n\r\n   “Nine days by cruel storms thence was I borne;”\r\n\r\nbut at the same time he takes no notice of this expression, which is his\r\nas well,\r\n\r\n   “And now borne sea-ward from the river stream\r\n   Of the Oceanus;”[128]\r\n\r\nand this,\r\n\r\n   “In the island of Ogygia, the centre of the sea,”[129]\r\n\r\nand that the daughter of Atlas[130] dwells there. And the following\r\nconcerning the Phæacians,\r\n\r\n   “Remote amid the billowy deep, we hold\r\n   Our dwelling, utmost of all human kind,\r\n   And free from mixture with a foreign race.”[131]\r\n\r\nThese passages clearly refer to the Atlantic Ocean,[132] but though so\r\nplainly expressed, Polybius slily manages to overlook them. Here he is\r\naltogether wrong, though quite correct about the wandering of Ulysses\r\nhaving taken place round Sicily and Italy, a fact which Homer\r\nestablishes himself. Otherwise, what poet or writer could have persuaded\r\nthe Neapolitans to assert that they possessed the tomb of\r\nParthenope[133] the Siren, or the inhabitants of Cumæ, Dicæarchia,[134]\r\nand Vesuvius [to bear their testimony] to Pyriphlegethon, the Marsh of\r\nAcherusia,[135] to the oracle of the dead which was near Aornus,[136]\r\nand to Baïus and Misenus,[137] the companions of Ulysses. The same is\r\nthe case with the Sirenussæ, and the Strait of Messina, and Scylla, and\r\nCharybdis, and Æolus, all which things should neither be examined into\r\ntoo rigorously, nor yet [despised] as groundless and without foundation,\r\nalike remote from truth and historic value.\r\n\r\n19. Eratosthenes seems to have had something like this view of the case\r\nhimself, when he says, “Any one would believe that the poet intended the\r\nwestern regions as the scene of Ulysses’ wanderings, but that he has\r\ndeparted from fact, sometimes through want of perfect information, at\r\nother times because he wished to give to scenes a more terrific and\r\nmarvellous appearance than they actually possessed.” So far this is\r\ntrue, but his idea of the object which the poet had in view while\r\ncomposing, is false; real advantage, not trifling, being his aim. We may\r\njustly reprehend his assertion on this point, as also where he says,\r\nthat Homer places the scene of his marvels in distant lands that he may\r\nlie the more easily. Remote localities have not furnished him with near\r\nso many wonderful narrations as Greece, and the countries thereto\r\nadjacent; witness the labours of Hercules, and Theseus, the fables\r\nconcerning Crete, Sicily, and the other islands; besides those connected\r\nwith Cithærum, Helicon,[138] Parnassus,[139] Pelion,[140] and the whole\r\nof Attica and the Peloponnesus. Let us not therefore tax the poets with\r\nignorance on account of the myths which they employ, and since, so far\r\nfrom myth being the staple, they for the most part avail themselves of\r\nactual occurrences, (and Homer does this in a remarkable degree,) the\r\ninquirer who will seek how far these ancient writers have wandered into\r\nfiction, ought not to scrutinize to what extent the fiction was carried,\r\nbut rather what is the truth concerning those places and persons to\r\nwhich the fictions have been applied; for instance, whether the\r\nwanderings of Ulysses did actually occur, and where.\r\n\r\n20. On the whole, however, it is not proper to place the works of Homer\r\nin the common catalogue of other poets, without challenging for him a\r\nsuperiority both in respect of his other [excellences] and also for the\r\ngeography on which our attention is now engaged.\r\n\r\nIf any one were to do no more than merely read through the Triptolemus\r\nof Sophocles, or the prologue to the Bacchæ of Euripides, and then\r\ncompare them with the care taken by Homer in his geographical\r\ndescriptions, he would at once perceive both the difference and\r\nsuperiority of the latter, for wherever there is necessity for\r\narrangement in the localities he has immortalized, he is careful to\r\npreserve it as well in regard to Greece, as to foreign countries.\r\n\r\n                               “They\r\n   On the Olympian summit thought to fix\r\n   Huge Ossa, and on Ossa’s towering head\r\n   Pelion with all his forests.”[141]\r\n\r\n   “And Juno starting from the Olympian height\r\n   O’erflew Pieria and the lovely plains\r\n   Of broad Emathia;[142] soaring thence she swept\r\n   The snow-clad summit of the Thracian hills[143]\r\n   Steed-famed, nor printed, as she pass’d, the soil,\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   From Athos[144] o’er the foaming billows borne.”[145]\r\n\r\nIn the Catalogue he does not describe his cities in regular order,\r\nbecause here there was no necessity, but both the people and foreign\r\ncountries he arranges correctly. “Having wandered to Cyprus, and\r\nPhœnice, and the Egyptians, I came to the Ethiopians, and Sidonians, and\r\nErembi, and Libya.”[146] Hipparchus has drawn attention to this. But the\r\ntwo tragedians, where there was great necessity for proper arrangement,\r\none[147] where he introduces Bacchus visiting the nations, the\r\nother[148] Triptolemus sowing the earth, have brought in juxta-position\r\nplaces far remote, and separated those which were near.\r\n\r\n“And having left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians, and the\r\nsunny plains of the Persians and the Bactrian walls, and having come\r\nover the stormy land of the Medes, and the Happy Arabia.”[149] And the\r\nTriptolemus is just as inaccurate.\r\n\r\nFurther, in respect to the winds and climates, Homer shows the wide\r\nextent of his geographical knowledge, for in his topographical\r\ndescriptions he not unfrequently informs us of both these matters. Thus,\r\n\r\n                       “My abode\r\n   Is sun-burnt Ithaca.\r\n   Flat on the deep she lies, farthest removed\r\n   Toward the west, while situate apart,\r\n   Her sister islands face the rising day.”[150]\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\n\r\n   “It has a two-fold entrance,\r\n   One towards the north, the other south.”[151]\r\n\r\nAnd again,\r\n\r\n   “Which I alike despise, speed they their course\r\n   With right-hand flight towards the ruddy east,\r\n   Or leftward down into the shades of eve.”[152]\r\n\r\nIgnorance of such matters he reckons no less than confusion.\r\n\r\n   “Alas! my friends, for neither west\r\n   Know we, nor east; where rises or where sets\r\n   The all-enlightening sun.”[153]\r\n\r\nWhere the poet has said properly enough,\r\n\r\n   “As when two adverse winds, blowing from Thrace,\r\n   Boreas and Zephyrus,”[154]\r\n\r\nEratosthenes ill-naturedly misrepresents him as saying in an absolute\r\nsense, that the west wind blows from Thrace; whereas he is not speaking\r\nin an absolute sense at all, but merely of the meeting of contrary winds\r\nnear the bay of Melas,[155] on the Thracian sea, itself a part of the\r\nÆgæan. For where Thrace forms a kind of promontory, where it borders on\r\nMacedonia,[156] it takes a turn to the south-west, and projects into\r\nthe ocean, and from this point it seems to the inhabitants of Thasos,\r\nLemnos, Imbros, Samothracia,[157] and the surrounding sea, that the west\r\nwinds blow.[158] So in regard to Attica, they seem to come from the\r\nrocks of Sciros,[159] and this is the reason why all the westerly winds,\r\nthe north-west more particularly, are called the Scirones. Of this\r\nEratosthenes was not aware, though he suspected as much, for it was he\r\nwho described this bending of the land [towards the south-west] which we\r\nhave mentioned. But he interprets our poet in an absolute sense, and\r\nthen taxes him with ignorance, because, says he, “Zephyr blows from the\r\nwest, and off Spain, and Thrace does not extend so far.” Does he then\r\nthink that Homer was not aware that Zephyr came from the west,\r\nnotwithstanding the careful manner in which he distinguishes its\r\nposition when he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n   “The east, the south, the heavy-blowing Zephyr,\r\n   And the cold north-wind clear.”[160]\r\n\r\nOr was he ignorant that Thrace did not extend beyond the Pæonian and\r\nThessalian mountains.[161] To be sure he was well acquainted with the\r\nposition of the countries adjoining Thrace in that direction, and does\r\nhe not mention by name both the maritime and inland districts, and tells\r\nus of the Magnetæ,[162] the Malians,[163] and other Grecian\r\n[territories], all in order, as far as Thesprotis;[164] also of the\r\nDolopes[165] bordering on Pæonia, and the Sellæ who inhabit the\r\nterritory around Dodona[166] as far as the [river] Achelous,[167] but he\r\nnever mentions Thrace, as being beyond these. He has evidently a\r\npredilection for the sea which is nearest to him, and with which he is\r\nmost familiar, as where he says,\r\n\r\n                       “Commotion shook\r\n   The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood\r\n   Of the Icarian deep.”[168]\r\n\r\n21. Some writers tell us there are but two principal winds, the north\r\nand south, and that the other winds are only a slight difference in the\r\ndirection of these two. That is, (supposing only two winds, the north\r\nand south,) the south wind from the commencement of the summer quarter\r\nblows in a south-easterly direction; and from the commencement of the\r\nwinter quarter from the east. The north wind from the decline of the\r\nsummer, blows in a westerly direction, and from the decline of the\r\nwinter, in a north-westerly direction.\r\n\r\nIn support of this opinion of the two winds they adduce Thrasyalces and\r\nour poet himself, forasmuch as he mentions the north-west with the\r\nsouth,\r\n\r\n   “From the north-west south,”[169]\r\n\r\nand the west with the north,\r\n\r\n   “As when two adverse winds, blowing from Thrace,\r\n   Boreas and Zephyrus.”[170]\r\n\r\nBut Posidonius remarks that none of those who are really acquainted with\r\nthese subjects, such as Aristotle, Timosthenes, and Bion the\r\nastronomer, entertain so mistaken an opinion in regard to the winds.\r\nThey say that the north-east (Cæcias) blows from the commencement of\r\nsummer, and that the south-west wind (Libs), which is exactly opposite\r\nto this, blows from the decline of winter. And again, the south-east\r\nwind (Eurus), which is opposite to the north-west wind (Argestes), from\r\nthe commencement of winter. The east and west winds being intermediate.\r\n\r\nWhen our poet makes use of the expression “stormy zephyr,” he means the\r\nwind which is now called by us the north-west; and by the “clear-blowing\r\nzephyr” our west wind; our Leuconotus is his Argestes-notus, or clearing\r\nsouth wind,[171] for this wind brings but few clouds, all the other\r\nsouthern winds bringing clouds and rain,[172]\r\n\r\n         “As when whirlwinds of the west\r\n   A storm encounter from the clearing south.”[173]\r\n\r\nHere he alludes to the stormy zephyr, which very frequently scatters the\r\nfeathery clouds brought up by the Leuconotus, or, as it is called by way\r\nof epithet, the clearing south.\r\n\r\nThe statements made by Eratosthenes in the first book of his Geography,\r\nrequire some such correction as this.\r\n\r\n22. Persisting in his false views in relation to Homer, he goes on to\r\nsay, “He was ignorant that the Nile separated into many mouths, nay, he\r\nwas not even acquainted with the name of the river, though Hesiod knew\r\nit well, for he even mentions it.”[174] In respect of the name, it is\r\nprobable that it had not then been given to the river, and as to the\r\nmouths, if they were obscure and little known, will not every one excuse\r\nhim for not being aware whether there were several or merely one? At\r\nthat time, the river, its rising, and its mouths were considered, as\r\nthey are at the present day, amongst the most remarkable, the most\r\nwonderful, and most worthy of recording of all the peculiarities of\r\nEgypt: who can suppose that those who told our poet of the country and\r\nriver of Egypt, of Egyptian Thebes, and of Pharos, were unaware of the\r\nmany embouchures of the Nile; or that being aware, they would not have\r\ndescribed them, were it not that they were too generally known? “But is\r\nit not inconceivable that Homer should describe Ethiopia, and the\r\nSidonians, the Erembi, and the Exterior Sea,[175]—should tell us that\r\nEthiopia was divided into two parts, and yet nothing about those things\r\nwhich were nearer and better known?” Certainly not, his not describing\r\nthese things is no proof that he was not acquainted with them. He does\r\nnot tell us of his own country, nor yet many other things. The most\r\nprobable reason is, they were so generally known that they did not\r\nappear to him worth recording.[176]\r\n\r\n23. Again, they are entirely wrong when they allege as a mark of Homer’s\r\nignorance, that he describes the island of Pharos[177] as entirely\r\nsurrounded by the sea. On the contrary, it might be taken advantage of\r\nas a proof that our poet was not unacquainted with a single one of the\r\npoints concerning Egypt which we have just been speaking of: and thus we\r\ndemonstrate it:—Every one is prone to romance a little in narrating\r\nhis travels, and Menelaus was no exception to the rule. He had been to\r\nEthiopia,[178] and there heard much discussion concerning the sources of\r\nthe Nile, and the alluvium which it deposited, both along its course and\r\nalso at its mouths, and the large additions which it had thereby made to\r\nthe mainland, so as fully to justify the remark of Herodotus[179] that\r\nthe whole of Egypt was a gift from the river; or if not the whole, at\r\nall events that part of it below the Delta, called Lower Egypt. He had\r\nheard too that Pharos was entirely surrounded by sea, and therefore\r\nmisrepresented it as entirely surrounded by the sea, although it had\r\nlong ago ceased so to be. Now the author of all this was Homer, and we\r\ntherefore infer that he was not ignorant concerning either the sources\r\nor the mouths of the Nile.\r\n\r\n24. They are again mistaken when they say that he was not aware of the\r\nisthmus between the sea of Egypt and the Arabian Gulf, and that his\r\ndescription is false,\r\n\r\n   “The Ethiopians, utmost of mankind,\r\n   These eastward situate, those toward the west.”[180]\r\n\r\nNevertheless he is correct, and the criticism of the moderns is quite\r\nout of place: indeed, there is so little truth in the assertion that\r\nHomer was ignorant of this isthmus, that I will venture to affirm he was\r\nnot only acquainted with it, but has also accurately defined it. But\r\nnone of the grammarians, not even the chiefs of their number,\r\nAristarchus and Crates, have understood the words of our poet on this\r\nsubject. For they disagree as to the words which follow this expression\r\nof Homer,\r\n\r\n   “The Ethiopians, utmost of mankind,\r\n   These eastward situate, those towards the west,”[181]\r\n\r\nAristarchus writing,\r\n\r\n   “These towards the west, and those towards the east,”\r\n\r\nand Crates,\r\n\r\n   “As well in the west as also in the east.”\r\n\r\nHowever, in regard to their hypotheses, it makes no difference whether\r\nthe passage were written this way or that. One of them, in fact, takes\r\nwhat he considers the mathematical view of the case, and says that the\r\ntorrid zone is occupied by the ocean,[182] and that on each side of this\r\nthere is a temperate zone, one inhabited by us and another opposite\r\nthereto. And as we call the Ethiopians, who are situated to the south,\r\nand dwell along the shores of the ocean, the most distant on the face of\r\nthe inhabited globe; so he supposed that on the other side of the\r\nocean,[183] there were certain Ethiopians dwelling along the shores, who\r\nwould in like manner be considered the most distant[184] by the\r\ninhabitants of the other temperate zone; and thus that the Ethiopians\r\nwere double, separated into two divisions by the ocean. He adds, “as\r\nwell in the west as also in the east,” because as the celestial zodiac\r\nalways corresponds to the terrestrial, and never exceeds in its\r\nobliquity the space occupied by the two Ethiopias, the sun’s entire\r\ncourse must necessarily be within this space, and also his rising and\r\nsetting, as it appears to different nations according to the sign which\r\nhe may be in.\r\n\r\nHe (Crates) adopted this version, because he considered it the more\r\nastronomical. But it would have maintained his opinion of the division\r\nof the Ethiopians into two parts, and at the same time have been much\r\nmore simple, had he said that the Ethiopians dwelt on either side of the\r\nocean from the rising to the setting of the sun. In this case what\r\ndifference does it make whether we follow his version, or adopt the\r\nreading of Aristarchus,\r\n\r\n   “These towards the west, and those towards the east?”\r\n\r\nwhich also means, that whether east or west, on either side of the\r\nocean, Ethiopians dwell. But Aristarchus rejects this hypothesis. He\r\nsays, “The Ethiopians with whom we are acquainted, and who are farthest\r\nsouth from the Greeks, are those described by the poet as being\r\nseparated into two divisions. But Ethiopia is not so separated as to\r\nform two countries, one situated towards the west, the other towards the\r\neast, but only one, that which lies south of the Greeks and adjoins\r\nEgypt; but of this the poet was ignorant, as well as of other matters\r\nenumerated by Apollodorus, which he has falsely stated concerning\r\nvarious places in his second book, containing the catalogue of the\r\nships.”\r\n\r\n25. To refute Crates would require a lengthened argument, which here\r\nperhaps may be considered out of place. Aristarchus we commend for\r\nrejecting the hypothesis of Crates, which is open to many objections,\r\nand for referring the expression of the poet to our Ethiopia. But the\r\nremainder of his statement we must discuss. First, his minute\r\nexamination of the reading is altogether fruitless, for whichever way it\r\nmay have been written, his interpretation is equally applicable to both;\r\nfor what difference is there whether you say thus—In our opinion there\r\nare two Ethiopias, one towards the east, the other to the west; or\r\nthus—For they are as well towards the east as the west? Secondly, he\r\nmakes false assumptions. For admitting that the poet was ignorant of the\r\nisthmus,[185] and that he alludes to the Ethiopia contiguous to Egypt,\r\nwhen he says,\r\n\r\n   The Ethiopians separated into two divisions;[186]\r\n\r\nwhat then? Are they not separated into two divisions, and could the poet\r\nhave thus expressed himself if he had been in ignorance? Is not Egypt,\r\nnay, are not the Egyptians, separated into two divisions by the Nile\r\nfrom the Delta to Syene,[187]\r\n\r\n   These towards the west, those towards the east?\r\n\r\nAnd what else is Egypt, with the exception of the island formed by the\r\nriver and overflowed by its waters; does it not lie on either side of\r\nthe river both east and west?\r\n\r\nEthiopia runs in the same direction as Egypt, and resembles it both in\r\nits position with respect to the Nile, and in its other geographical\r\ncircumstances. It is narrow, long, and subject to inundation; beyond the\r\nreach of this inundation it is desolate and parched, and unfitted for\r\nthe habitation of man; some districts lying to the east and some to the\r\nwest of [the river]. How then can we deny that it is separated into two\r\ndivisions? Shall the Nile, which is looked upon by some people as the\r\nproper boundary line between Asia and Libya,[188] and which extends\r\nsouthward in length more than 10,000 stadia, embracing in its breadth\r\nislands which contain populations of above ten thousand men, the largest\r\nof these being Meroe, the seat of empire and metropolis of the\r\nEthiopians, be regarded as too insignificant to divide Ethiopia into two\r\nparts? The greatest obstacle which they who object to the river being\r\nmade the line of demarcation between the two continents are able to\r\nallege, is, that Egypt and Ethiopia are by this means divided, one part\r\nof each being assigned to Libya, and the other to Asia, or, if this will\r\nnot suit, the continents cannot be divided at all, or at least not by\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n26. But besides these there is another method of dividing Ethiopia. All\r\nthose who have sailed along the coasts of Libya, whether starting from\r\nthe Arabian Gulf,[189] or the Pillars,[190] after proceeding a certain\r\ndistance, have been obliged to turn back again on account of a variety\r\nof accidents; and thus originated a general belief that it was divided\r\nmidway by some isthmus, although the whole of the Atlantic Ocean is\r\nconfluent, more especially towards the south. Besides, all of these\r\nnavigators called the final country which they reached, Ethiopia, and\r\ndescribed it under that name. Is it therefore at all incredible, that\r\nHomer, misled by such reports, separated them into two divisions, one\r\ntowards the east and the other west, not knowing whether there were any\r\nintermediate countries or not? But there is another ancient tradition\r\nrelated by Ephorus, which Homer had probably fallen in with. He tells us\r\nit is reported by the Tartessians,[191] that some of the Ethiopians, on\r\ntheir arrival in Libya,[192] penetrated into the extreme west, and\r\nsettled down there, while the rest occupied the greater part of the\r\nsea-coast; and in support of this statement he quotes the passage of\r\nHomer,\r\n\r\n   The Ethiopians, the farthest removed of men, separated into two\r\n   divisions.\r\n\r\n27. These and other more stringent arguments may be urged against\r\nAristarchus and those of his school, to clear our poet from the charge\r\nof such gross ignorance. I assert that the ancient Greeks, in the same\r\nway as they classed all the northern nations with which they were\r\nfamiliar under the one name of Scythians, or, according to Homer,\r\nNomades, and afterwards becoming acquainted with those towards the\r\nwest, styled them Kelts and Iberians; sometimes compounding the names\r\ninto Keltiberians, or Keltoscythians, thus ignorantly uniting various\r\ndistinct nations; so I affirm they designated as Ethiopia the whole of\r\nthe southern countries towards the ocean. Of this there is evidence, for\r\nÆschylus, in the Prometheus Loosed,[193] thus speaks:\r\n\r\n   There [is] the sacred wave, and the coralled bed of the Erythræan\r\n   Sea, and [there] the luxuriant marsh of the Ethiopians, situated\r\n   near the ocean, glitters like polished brass; where daily in the\r\n   soft and tepid stream, the all-seeing sun bathes his undying\r\n   self, and refreshes his weary steeds.\r\n\r\nAnd as the ocean holds the same position in respect to the sun, and\r\nserves the same purpose throughout the whole southern region,[194]\r\nhe[195] therefore concludes that the Ethiopians inhabited the whole of\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\nAnd Euripides in his Phaeton[196] says that Clymene was given\r\n\r\n   “To Merops, sovereign of that land\r\n   Which from his four-horsed chariot first\r\n   The rising sun strikes with his golden rays;\r\n   And which its swarthy neighbours call\r\n   The radiant stable of the Morn and Sun.”\r\n\r\nHere the poet merely describes them as the common stables of the Morning\r\nand of the Sun; but further on he tells us they were near to the\r\ndwellings of Merops, and in fact the whole plot of the piece has\r\nreference to this. This does not therefore refer alone to the [land]\r\nnext to Egypt, but rather to the whole southern country extending along\r\nthe sea-coast.\r\n\r\n28. Ephorus likewise shows us the opinion of the ancients respecting\r\nEthiopia, in his Treatise on Europe. He says, “If the whole celestial\r\nand terrestrial globe were divided into four parts, the Indians would\r\npossess that towards the east, the Ethiopians towards the south, the\r\nKelts towards the west, and the Scythians towards the north.” He adds\r\nthat Ethiopia is larger than Scythia; for, says he, it appears that the\r\ncountry of the Ethiopians extends from the rising to the setting of the\r\nsun in winter; and Scythia is opposite to it.\r\n\r\nIt is evident this was the opinion of Homer, since he places Ithaca\r\n\r\n   Towards the gloomy region,[197]\r\n\r\nthat is, towards the north,[198] but the others apart,\r\n\r\n   Towards the morning and the sun,\r\n\r\nby which he means the whole southern hemisphere: and again when he says,\r\n\r\n                         “speed they their course\r\n   With right-hand flight towards the ruddy east,\r\n   Or leftward down into the shades of eve.”[199]\r\n\r\nAnd again,\r\n\r\n   “Alas! my friends, for neither west\r\n   Know we, nor east, where rises or where sets\r\n   The all-enlightening sun.”[200]\r\n\r\nWhich we shall explain more fully when we come to speak of Ithaca.[201]\r\n\r\nWhen therefore he says,\r\n\r\n   “For to the banks of the Oceanus,\r\n   Where Ethiopia holds a feast to Jove,\r\n   He journey’d yesterday,”[202]\r\n\r\nwe should take this in a general sense, and understand by it the whole\r\nof the ocean which washes Ethiopia and the southern region, for to\r\nwhatever part of this region you direct your attention, you will there\r\nfind both the ocean and Ethiopia. It is in a similar style he says,\r\n\r\n   “But Neptune, traversing in his return\r\n   From Ethiopia’s sons the mountain heights\r\n   Of Solymè, descried him from afar.”[203]\r\n\r\nwhich is equal to saying, “in his return from the southern\r\nregions,”[204] meaning by the Solymi, as I remarked before, not those of\r\nPisidia, but certain others merely imaginary, having the same name, and\r\nbearing the like relation to the navigators in [Ulysses’] ship, and the\r\nsouthern inhabitants there called Ethiopians, as those of Pisidia do in\r\nregard to Pontus and the inhabitants of Egyptian Ethiopia. What he says\r\nabout the cranes must likewise be understood in a general sense.\r\n\r\n                 “Such clang is heard\r\n   Along the skies, when from incessant showers\r\n   Escaping, and from winter’s cold, the cranes\r\n   Take wing, and over ocean speed away.\r\n   Woe to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly\r\n   For slaughter of the small Pygmæan race.”[205]\r\n\r\nFor it is not in Greece alone that the crane is observed to emigrate to\r\nmore southern regions, but likewise from Italy and Iberia,[206] from\r\n[the shores of] the Caspian, and from Bactriana. But since the ocean\r\nextends along the whole southern coast, and the cranes fly to all parts\r\nof it indiscriminately at the approach of winter, we must likewise\r\nbelieve that the Pygmies[207] were equally considered to inhabit the\r\nwhole of it.\r\n\r\nAnd if the moderns have confined the term of Ethiopians to those only\r\nwho dwell near to Egypt, and have also restricted the Pygmies in like\r\nmanner, this must not be allowed to interfere with the meaning of the\r\nancients. We do not speak of all the people who fought against Troy as\r\nmerely Achæans and Argives, though Homer describes the whole under those\r\ntwo names. Similar to this is my remark concerning the separation of the\r\nEthiopians into two divisions, that under that designation we should\r\nunderstand the whole of the nations inhabiting the sea-board from east\r\nto west. The Ethiopians taken in this sense are naturally separated into\r\ntwo parts by the Arabian Gulf, which occupies a considerable portion of\r\na meridian circle,[208] and resembles a river, being in length nearly\r\n15,000 stadia,[209] and in breadth not above 1000 at the widest point.\r\nIn addition to the length, the recess of the Gulf is distant from the\r\nsea at Pelusium only three or four days’ journey across the isthmus. On\r\nthis account those who are most felicitous in their division of Asia and\r\nAfrica, prefer the Gulf[210] as a better boundary line for the two\r\ncontinents than the Nile, since it extends almost entirely from sea to\r\nsea, whereas the Nile is so remote from the ocean that it does not by\r\nany means divide the whole of Asia from Africa. On this account I\r\nbelieve it was the Gulf which the poet looked upon as dividing into two\r\nportions the whole southern regions of the inhabited earth. Is it\r\npossible, then, that he was unacquainted with the isthmus which\r\nseparates this Gulf from the Egyptian Sea?[211]\r\n\r\n29. It is quite irrational to suppose that he could be accurately\r\nacquainted with Egyptian Thebes,[212] which is separated from our\r\nsea[213] by a little less than 5000[214] stadia; and yet ignorant of the\r\nrecess of the Arabian Gulf, and of the isthmus there, whose breadth is\r\nnot more than 1000 stadia. Still more, would it not be ridiculous to\r\nbelieve that Homer was aware the Nile was called by the same name as the\r\nvast country [of Egypt], and yet unacquainted with the reason why?\r\nespecially since the saying of Herodotus would occur to him, that the\r\ncountry was a gift from the river, and it ought therefore to bear its\r\nname. Further, the best known peculiarities of a country are those which\r\nhave something of the nature of a paradox, and are likely to arrest\r\ngeneral attention. Of this kind are the rising of the Nile, and the\r\nalluvial deposition at its mouth. There is nothing in the whole country\r\nto which travellers in Egypt so immediately direct their inquiries, as\r\nthe character of the Nile; nor do the inhabitants possess any thing else\r\nequally wonderful and curious, of which to inform foreigners; for in\r\nfact, to give them a description of the river, is to lay open to their\r\nview every main characteristic of the country. It is the question put\r\nbefore every other by those who have never seen Egypt themselves. To\r\nthese considerations we must add Homer’s thirst after knowledge, and his\r\ndelight in visiting foreign lands, (tastes which we are assured both by\r\nthose who have written histories of his life, and also by innumerable\r\ntestimonies throughout his own poems, he possessed in an eminent\r\ndegree,) and we shall have abundant evidence both of the extent of his\r\ninformation, and the felicity with which he described objects he deemed\r\nimportant, and passed over altogether, or with slight allusion, matters\r\nwhich were generally known.\r\n\r\n30. These Egyptians and Syrians[215] whom we have been criticising fill\r\none with amazement. They do not understand [Homer], even when he is\r\ndescribing their own countries, but accuse him of ignorance where, as\r\nour argument proves, they are open to the charge themselves. Not to\r\nmention a thing is clearly no evidence that a person is not acquainted\r\nwith it.[216] Homer does not tell us of the change in the current of the\r\nEuripus, nor of Thermopylæ, nor of many other remarkable things well\r\nknown to the Greeks; but was he therefore unacquainted with them? He\r\ndescribes to us, although these men, who are obstinately deaf, will not\r\nhear: they have themselves to blame.\r\n\r\nOur poet applies to rivers the epithet of “heaven-sent.” And this not\r\nonly to mountain torrents, but to all rivers alike, since they are all\r\nreplenished by the showers. But even what is general becomes particular\r\nwhen it is bestowed on any object _par excellence_. Heaven-sent, when\r\napplied to a mountain torrent, means something else than when it is the\r\nepithet of the ever-flowing river; but the force of the term is doubly\r\nfelt when attributed to the Nile. For as there are hyperboles of\r\nhyperboles, for instance, to be “lighter than the shadow of a cork,”\r\n“more timid than a Phrygian hare,”[217] “to possess an estate shorter\r\nthan a Lacedæmonian epistle;” so excellence becomes more excellent, when\r\nthe title of “heaven-sent” is given to the Nile. The mountain torrent\r\nhas a better claim to be called heaven-sent than other rivers, but the\r\nNile exceeds the mountain torrents, both in its size and the lengthened\r\nperiod of its overflow. Since, then, the wonders of this river were\r\nknown to our poet, as we have shown in this defence, when he applies\r\nthis epithet to the Nile, it must only be understood in the way we have\r\nexplained. Homer did not think it worth mentioning, especially to those\r\nwho were acquainted with the fact, that the Nile had many mouths, since\r\nthis is a common feature of numerous other rivers. Alcæus[218] does not\r\nmention it, although he tells us he had been in Egypt. One might infer\r\nthe fact of its alluvial deposit, both from the rising [of the river]\r\nand what Homer tells us concerning Pharos. For his account, or rather\r\nthe vulgar report concerning Pharos, that it was distant from the\r\nmainland a whole day’s voyage, ought not to be looked upon as a\r\ndownright falsehood.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Homer was only acquainted with the rising and deposit\r\nof the river in a general way, and concluding from what he heard that\r\nthe island had been further removed in the time of Menelaus from the\r\nmainland, than it was in his own, he magnified the distance, simply that\r\nhe might heighten the fiction. Fictions however are not the offspring of\r\nignorance, as is sufficiently plain from those concerning Proteus, the\r\nPygmies, the efficacy of charms, and many others similar to these\r\nfabricated by the poets. They narrate these things not through ignorance\r\nof the localities, but for the sake of giving pleasure and enjoyment.\r\nBut [some one may inquire], how could he describe [Pharos], which is\r\nwithout water as possessed of that necessary?\r\n\r\n   “The haven there is good, and many a ship\r\n   Finds watering there from rivulets on the coast.”[219]\r\n\r\n[I answer,] It is not impossible that the sources of water may since\r\nhave failed. Besides, he does not say that the water was procured from\r\nthe island, but that they went thither on account of the safety of the\r\nharbour; the water was probably obtained from the mainland, and by the\r\nexpression the poet seems to admit that what he had before said of its\r\nbeing wholly surrounded by sea was not the actual fact, but a hyperbole\r\nor fiction.\r\n\r\n31. As his description of the wanderings of Menelaus may seem to\r\nauthenticate the charge of ignorance made against him in respect to\r\nthose regions, it will perhaps be best to point out the difficulties of\r\nthe narrative, and their explanation, and at the same time enter into a\r\nfuller defence of our poet. Menelaus thus addresses Telemachus, who is\r\nadmiring the splendour of his palace:\r\n\r\n                     “After numerous toils\r\n   And perilous wanderings o’er the stormy deep,\r\n   In the eighth year at last I brought them home.\r\n   Cyprus, Phœnicia, Sidon, and the shores\r\n   Of Egypt, roaming without hope, I reach’d,\r\n   In distant Ethiopia thence arrived,\r\n   And Libya.”[220]\r\n\r\nIt is asked, What Ethiopians could he have met with on his voyage from\r\nEgypt? None are to be found dwelling by our sea,[221] and with his\r\nvessels[222] he could never have reached the cataracts of the Nile.\r\nNext, who are the Sidonians? Certainly not the inhabitants of Phœnicia;\r\nfor having mentioned the genus, he would assuredly not particularize the\r\nspecies.[223] And then the Erembi; this is altogether a new name. Our\r\ncontemporary Aristonicus, the grammarian, in his [observations] on the\r\nwanderings of Menelaus, has recorded the opinions of numerous writers on\r\neach of the heads under discussion. It will be sufficient for us to\r\nrefer to them very briefly. They who assert that Menelaus went by sea to\r\nEthiopia, tell us he directed his course past Cadiz into the Indian\r\nOcean;[224] with which, say they, the long duration of his wanderings\r\nagrees, since he did not arrive there till the eighth year. Others, that\r\nhe passed through the isthmus[225] which enters the Arabian Gulf; and\r\nothers again, through one of the canals. At the same time the idea of\r\nthis circumnavigation, which owes its origin to Crates, is not\r\nnecessary; we do not mean it was impossible, (for the wanderings of\r\nUlysses are not impossible,) but neither the mathematical hypothesis,\r\nnor yet the duration of the wandering, require such an explanation; for\r\nhe was both retarded against his will by accidents in the voyage, as by\r\n[the tempest] which he narrates five only of his sixty ships survived;\r\nand also by voluntary delays for the sake of amassing wealth. Nestor\r\nsays [of him],\r\n\r\n   “Thus he, provision gathering as he went,\r\n   And gold abundant, roam’d to distant lands.”[226]\r\n\r\n[And Menelaus himself],\r\n\r\n   “Cyprus, Phœnicia, and the Egyptians’ land\r\n   I wandered through.”[227]\r\n\r\nAs to the navigation of the isthmus, or one of the canals, if it had\r\nbeen related by Homer himself, we should have counted it a myth; but as\r\nhe does not relate it, we regard it as entirely extravagant and unworthy\r\nof belief. We say unworthy of belief, because at the time of the Trojan\r\nwar no canal was in existence. It is recorded that Sesostris, who had\r\nplanned the formation of one, apprehending that the level of the sea was\r\ntoo high to admit of it, desisted from the undertaking.[228]\r\n\r\nMoreover the isthmus itself was not passable for ships, and Eratosthenes\r\nis unfortunate in his conjecture, for he considers that the strait at\r\nthe Pillars was not then formed, so that the Atlantic should by that\r\nchannel communicate with the Mediterranean, and that this sea being\r\nhigher than the Isthmus [of Suez], covered it; but when the Strait [of\r\nGibraltar] was formed, the sea subsided considerably; and left the land\r\nabout Casium[229] and Pelusium[230] dry as far over as the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nBut what account have we of the formation of this strait, supposing it\r\nwere not in existence prior to the Trojan war? Is it likely that our\r\npoet would make Ulysses sail out through the Strait [of Gibraltar] into\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, as if that strait already existed, and at the same\r\ntime describe Menelaus conducting his ships from Egypt to the Red Sea,\r\nas if it did not exist. Further, the poet introduces Proteus as saying\r\nto him,\r\n\r\n                 “Thee the gods\r\n   Have destined to the blest Elysian Isles,\r\n   Earth’s utmost boundaries.”[231]\r\n\r\nAnd what this place was, namely, some far western region, is evident\r\nfrom [the mention of] the Zephyr in connexion with it:\r\n\r\n   “But Zephyr always gently from the sea\r\n   Breathes on them.”[232]\r\n\r\nThis, however, is very enigmatical.\r\n\r\n32. But if our poet speaks of the Isthmus of Suez as ever having been\r\nthe strait of confluence between the Mediterranean and the Red Seas, how\r\nmuch more credit may we attribute to his division of the Ethiopians into\r\ntwo portions, being thus separated by so grand a strait! And what\r\ncommerce could he have carried on with the Ethiopians who dwelt by the\r\nshores of the exterior sea and the ocean? Telemachus and his companions\r\nadmire the multitude of ornaments that were in the palace,\r\n\r\n   “Of gold, electrum, silver, ivory.”[233]\r\n\r\nNow the Ethiopians are possessed of none of these productions in any\r\nabundance, excepting ivory, being for the most part a needy and nomad\r\nrace. True, [you say,] but adjoining them is Arabia, and the whole\r\ncountry as far as India. One of these is distinguished above all other\r\nlands by the title of Felix,[234] and the other, though not dignified by\r\nthat name, is both generally believed and also said to be pre-eminently\r\nBlessed.\r\n\r\nBut [we reply], Homer was not acquainted with India, or he would have\r\ndescribed it. And though he knew of the Arabia which is now named Felix,\r\nat that time it was by no means wealthy, but a wild country, the\r\ninhabitants of which dwelt for the most part in tents. It is only a\r\nsmall district which produces the aromatics from which the whole\r\nterritory afterwards received its name,[235] owing to the rarity of the\r\ncommodity amongst us, and the value set upon it. That the Arabians are\r\nnow flourishing and wealthy is due to their vast and extended traffic,\r\nbut formerly it does not appear to have been considerable. A merchant or\r\ncamel-driver might attain to opulence by the sale of these aromatics and\r\nsimilar commodities; but Menelaus could only become so either by\r\nplunder, or presents conferred on him by kings and nobles, who had the\r\nmeans at their disposal, and wished to gratify one so distinguished by\r\nglory and renown. The Egyptians, it is true, and the neighbouring\r\nEthiopians and Arabians, were not so entirely destitute of the luxuries\r\nof civilization, nor so unacquainted with the fame of Agamemnon,\r\nespecially after the termination of the Trojan war, but that Menelaus\r\nmight have expected some benefits from their generosity, even as the\r\nbreastplate of Agamemnon is said to be\r\n\r\n                       “The gift\r\n   Of Cinyras long since; for rumour loud\r\n   Had Cyprus reached.”[236]\r\n\r\nAnd we are told that the greater part of his wanderings were in\r\nPhœnicia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, around Cyprus, and, in fact, the whole\r\nof our coasts and islands.[237] Here, indeed, he might hope to enrich\r\nhimself both by the gifts of friendship and by violence, and especially\r\nby the plunder of those who had been the allies of Troy. They however\r\nwho dwelt on the exterior ocean, and the distant barbarians, held out no\r\nsuch encouragement: and when Menelaus is said to have been in Ethiopia,\r\nit is because he had reached the frontiers of that country next Egypt.\r\nBut perhaps at that time the frontiers lay more contiguous to Thebes\r\nthan they do now. At the present day the nearest are the districts\r\nadjacent to Syene and Philæ,[238] the former town being entirely in\r\nEgypt, while Philæ is inhabited by a mixed population of Ethiopians and\r\nEgyptians. Supposing therefore he had arrived at Thebes, and thus\r\nreached the boundary-line of Ethiopia, where he experienced the\r\nmunificence of the king, we must not be surprised if he is described as\r\nhaving passed through the country.[239] On no better authority Ulysses\r\ndeclares he has been to the land of the Cyclops, although he merely left\r\nthe sea to enter a cavern which he himself tells us was situated on the\r\nvery borders of the country: and, in fact, wherever he came to anchor,\r\nwhether at Æolia, Læstrygonia, or elsewhere, he is stated to have\r\nvisited those places. In the same manner Menelaus is said to have been\r\nto Ethiopia and Libya, because here and there he touched at those\r\nplaces, and the port near Ardania above Parætonium[240] is called after\r\nhim “the port of Menelaus.”[241]\r\n\r\n33. When, after mentioning Phœnicia, he talks of Sidon, its metropolis,\r\nhe merely employs a common form of expression, for example,\r\n\r\n   He urged the Trojans and Hector to the ships.[242]\r\n\r\n   For the sons of magnanimous Œneus were no more, nor was he himself\r\n     surviving; moreover, fair-haired Meleager was dead.[243]\r\n\r\n   He came to Ida—and to Gargarus.[244]\r\n\r\n   He possessed Eubœa, Chalcis, and Eretria.[245]\r\n\r\nSappho likewise [says],\r\n\r\n   Whether Cyprus, or the spacious-harboured Paphos.[246]\r\n\r\nBut he had some other cause besides this for mentioning Sidon\r\nimmediately after having spoken of the Phœnicians: for had he merely\r\ndesired to recount the nations in order, it would have been quite\r\nsufficient to say,\r\n\r\n   Having wandered to Cyprus, Phœnice, and the Egyptians, I came to\r\n   the Ethiopians.[247]\r\n\r\nBut that he might record his sojourn amongst the Sidonians, which was\r\nconsiderably prolonged, he thought it well to refer to it repeatedly.\r\nThus he praises their prosperity and skill in the arts, and alludes to\r\nthe hospitality the citizens had shown to Helen and Alexander. Thus he\r\ntells us of the many [treasures] of this nature laid up in store by\r\nAlexander.[248]\r\n\r\n             “There his treasures lay,\r\n   Works of Sidonian women, whom her son,\r\n   The godlike Paris, when he crossed the seas\r\n   With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy.”[249]\r\n\r\nAnd also by Menelaus, who says to Telemachus,\r\n\r\n   “I give thee this bright beaker, argent all,\r\n   But round encircled with a lip of gold.\r\n   It is the work of Vulcan, which to me\r\n   The hero Phædimus presented, king\r\n   Of the Sidonians, when on my return\r\n   Beneath his roof I lodged. I make it thine.”[250]\r\n\r\nHere the expression, “work of Vulcan,” must be looked upon as a\r\nhyperbole: in the same way all elegant productions are said to be the\r\nwork of Minerva, of the Graces, or of the Muses. But that the Sidonians\r\nwere skilful artists, is clear from the praises bestowed [by Homer] on\r\nthe bowl which Euneos gave in exchange for Lycaon:\r\n\r\n                                   “Earth\r\n   Own’d not its like for elegance of form.\r\n   Skilful Sidonian artists had around\r\n   Embellish’d it, and o’er the sable deep\r\n   Phœnician merchants into Lemnos’ port\r\n   Had borne it.”[251]\r\n\r\n34. Many conjectures have been hazarded as to who the Erembi were: they\r\nwho suppose the Arabs are intended, seem to deserve the most credit.\r\n\r\nOur Zeno reads the passage thus:—\r\n\r\n   I came to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Arabians.\r\n\r\nBut there is no occasion to tamper with the text, which is of great\r\nantiquity; it is a far preferable course to suppose a change in the name\r\nitself, which is of frequent and ordinary occurrence in every nation:\r\nand in fact certain grammarians establish this view by a comparison of\r\nthe radical letters. Posidonius seems to me to adopt the better plan\r\nafter all, in looking for the etymology of names in nations of one stock\r\nand community; thus between the Armenians, Syrians, and Arabians there\r\nis a strong affinity both in regard to dialect, mode of life,\r\npeculiarities of physical conformation, and above all in the contiguity\r\nof the countries. Mesopotamia, which is a motley of the three nations,\r\nis a proof of this; for the similarity amongst these three is very\r\nremarkable. And though in consequence of the various latitudes there may\r\nbe some difference between those who dwell in the north[252] and those\r\nof the south,[253] and again between each of these and the inhabitants\r\nof the middle region,[254] still the same characteristics are dominant\r\nin all. Also the Assyrians and Arians have a great affinity both to\r\nthese people and to each other. And [Posidonius] believes there is a\r\nsimilarity in the names of these different nations. Those whom we call\r\nSyrians style themselves Armenians and Arammæans, names greatly like\r\nthose of the Armenians, Arabs, and Erembi. Perhaps this [last] term is\r\nthat by which the Greeks anciently designated the Arabs; the etymon of\r\nthe word certainly strengthens the idea. Many deduce the etymology of\r\nthe Erembi from ἔραν ἐμβαίνειν, (to go into the earth,) which [they say]\r\nwas altered by the people of a later generation into the more\r\nintelligible name of Troglodytes,[255] by which are intended those Arabs\r\nwho dwell on that side of the Arabian Gulf next to Egypt and Ethiopia.\r\nIt is probable then that the poet describes Menelaus as having visited\r\nthese people in the same way that he says he visited the Ethiopians; for\r\nthey are likewise near to the Thebaid; and he mentions them not on\r\naccount of any commerce or gain, (for of these there was not much,) but\r\nprobably to enhance the length of the journey and his meed of praise:\r\nfor such distant travelling was highly thought of. For example,—\r\n\r\n   “Discover’d various cities, and the mind\r\n   And manners learn’d of men in lands remote.”[256]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n                     “After numerous toils\r\n   And perilous wanderings o’er the stormy deep,\r\n   In the eighth year at last I brought them home.”[257]\r\n\r\nHesiod, in his Catalogue,[258] writes,\r\n\r\n   And the daughter of Arabus, whom gracious Hermes and Thronia,\r\n   descended from king Belus, brought forth.\r\n\r\nThus, too, says Stesichorus. Whence it seems that at that time the\r\ncountry was from him named Arabia, though it is not likely this was the\r\ncase in the heroic period.[259]\r\n\r\n35. There are many who would make the Erembi a tribe of the Ethiopians,\r\nor of the Cephenes, or again of the Pygmies, and a thousand other\r\nfancies. These ought to be regarded with little trust; since their\r\nopinion is not only incredible, but they evidently labour under a\r\ncertain confusion as to the different characters of history and fable.\r\nIn the same category must be reckoned those who place the Sidonians and\r\nPhœnicians in the Persian Gulf, or somewhere else in the Ocean, and make\r\nthe wanderings of Menelaus to have happened there. Not the least cause\r\nfor mistrusting these writers is the manner in which they contradict\r\neach other. One half would have us believe that the Sidonians are a\r\ncolony from the people whom they describe as located on the shores of\r\nthe [Indian] Ocean, and who they say were called Phœnicians from the\r\ncolour of the Erythræan Sea, while the others declare the opposite.[260]\r\n\r\nSome again would transport Ethiopia into our Phœnicia, and make Joppa\r\nthe scene of the adventures of Andromeda;[261] and this not from any\r\nignorance of the topography of those places, but by a kind of mythic\r\nfiction similar to those of Hesiod and other writers censured by\r\nApollodorus, who, however, couples Homer with them, without, as it\r\nappears, any cause. He cites as instances what Homer relates of the\r\nEuxine and Egypt, and accuses him of ignorance for pretending to speak\r\nthe actual truth, and then recounting fable, all the while ignorantly\r\nmistaking it for fact. Will any one then accuse Hesiod of ignorance on\r\naccount of his _Hemicynes_,[262] his _Macrocephali_,[263] and his\r\nPygmies; or Homer for his like fables, and amongst others the Pygmies\r\nthemselves; or Alcman[264] for describing the _Steganopodes_;[265] or\r\nÆschylus for his _Cynocephali_,[266] _Sternophthalmi_,[267] and\r\n_Monommati_;[268] when amongst prose writers, and in works bearing the\r\nappearance of veritable history, we frequently meet with similar\r\nnarrations, and that without any admission of their having inserted such\r\nmyths. Indeed it becomes immediately evident that they have woven\r\ntogether a tissue of myths not through ignorance of the real facts, but\r\nmerely to amuse by a deceptive narration of the impossible and\r\nmarvellous. If they appear to do this in ignorance, it is because they\r\ncan romance more frequently and with greater plausibility on those\r\nthings which are uncertain and unknown. This Theopompus plainly\r\nconfesses in the announcement of his intention to relate the fables in\r\nhis history in a better style than Herodotus, Ctesias, Hellanicus, and\r\nthose who had written on the affairs of India.\r\n\r\n36. Homer has described to us the phenomena of the ocean under the form\r\nof a myth; this [art] is very desirable in a poet; the idea of his\r\nCharybdis was taken from the ebb and flow of the tide, and was by no\r\nmeans a pure invention of his own, but derived from what he knew\r\nconcerning the Strait of Sicily.[269] And although he states that the\r\nebb and flow occurred thrice during the four and twenty hours, instead\r\nof twice,\r\n\r\n   “(Each day she thrice disgorges, and each day\r\n   Thrice swallows it,”)[270]\r\n\r\nwe must suppose that he said this not through any ignorance of the fact,\r\nbut for tragic effect, and to excite the fear which Circe endeavours to\r\ninfuse into her arguments to deter Ulysses from departing, even at a\r\nlittle expense of truth. The following is the language Circe makes use\r\nof in her speech to him:\r\n\r\n   “Each day she thrice disgorges, and each day\r\n   Thrice swallows it. Ah! well-forewarn’d beware\r\n   What time she swallows, that thou come not nigh,\r\n   For not himself, Neptune, could snatch thee thence.”[271]\r\n\r\nAnd yet when Ulysses was ingulfed in the eddy he was not lost. He tells\r\nus himself,\r\n\r\n   “It was the time when she absorb’d profound\r\n   The briny flood, but by a wave upborne,\r\n   I seized the branches fast of the wild fig,\r\n   To which bat-like I clung.”[272]\r\n\r\nAnd then having waited for the timbers of the wreck he seized hold of\r\nthem, and thus saved himself. Circe, therefore, had exaggerated both the\r\nperil, and also the fact of its vomiting forth thrice a day instead of\r\ntwice. However, this latter is a hyperbole which every one makes use of;\r\nthus we say thrice-happy and thrice-miserable.\r\n\r\nSo the poet,\r\n\r\n   “Thrice-happy Greeks!”[273]\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n   “O delightful, thrice-wished for!”[274]\r\n\r\nAnd again,\r\n\r\n   “O thrice and four times.”[275]\r\n\r\nAny one, too, might conclude from the passage itself that Homer even\r\nhere hinted at the truth, for the long time which the remains of the\r\nwreck lay under water, which Ulysses, who was all the while hanging\r\nsuspended to the branches, so anxiously desired to rise, accords much\r\nbetter with the ebb and flow taking place but twice during the night and\r\nday instead of thrice.\r\n\r\n                           “Therefore hard\r\n   I clench’d the boughs, till she disgorged again\r\n   Both keel and mast. Not undesired by me\r\n   They came, though late; for at what hour the judge,\r\n   After decision made of numerous strifes\r\n   Between young candidates for honour, leaves\r\n   The forum, for refreshment’s sake at home,\r\n   Then was it that the mast and keel emerged.”[276]\r\n\r\nEvery word of this indicates a considerable length of time, especially\r\nwhen he prolongs it to the evening, not merely saying at that time when\r\nthe judge has risen, but having adjudicated on a vast number of cases,\r\nand therefore detained longer than usual. Otherwise his account of the\r\nreturn of the wreck would not have appeared likely, if he had brought it\r\nback again with the return of the wave, before it had been first carried\r\na long way off.\r\n\r\n37. Apollodorus, who agrees with Eratosthenes, throws much blame upon\r\nCallimachus for asserting, in spite of his character as a grammarian,\r\nthat Gaudus[277] and Corcyra[278] were among the scenes of Ulysses’\r\nwandering, such an opinion being altogether in defiance of Homer’s\r\nstatement, and his description of the places as situated in the exterior\r\nocean.[279]\r\n\r\nThis criticism is just if we suppose the wandering to have never\r\nactually occurred, and to be merely the result of Homer’s imagination;\r\nbut if it did take place, although in other regions, Apollodorus ought\r\nplainly to have stated which they were, and thus set right the mistake\r\nof Callimachus. Since, however, after such evidence as we have produced,\r\nwe cannot believe the whole account to be a fiction, and since no other\r\nmore likely places have as yet been named, we hold that the grammarian\r\nis absolved from blame.\r\n\r\n38. Demetrius of Skepsis is also wrong, and, in fact, the cause of some\r\nof the mistakes of Apollodorus. He eagerly objects to the statement of\r\nNeanthes of Cyzicus, that the Argonauts, when they sailed to the\r\nPhasis,[280] founded at Cyzicus the temples of the Idæan Mother.[281]\r\nThough their voyage is attested both by Homer and other writers, he\r\ndenies that Homer had any knowledge whatever of the departure of Jason\r\nto the Phasis. In so doing, he not only contradicts the very words of\r\nHomer, but even his own assertions. The poet informs us that Achilles,\r\nhaving ravaged Lesbos[282] and other districts, spared Lemnos[283] and\r\nthe adjoining islands, on account of his relationship with Jason and his\r\nson Euneos,[284] who then had possession of the island. How should he\r\nknow of a relationship, identity of race, or other connexion existing\r\nbetween Achilles and Jason, which, after all, was nothing else than that\r\nthey were both Thessalians, one being of Iolcos,[285] the other of the\r\nAchæan Pthiotis,[286] and yet was not aware how it happened that Jason,\r\nwho was a Thessalian of Iolcos, should leave no descendants in the land\r\nof his nativity, but establish his son as ruler of Lemnos? Homer then\r\nwas familiar with the history of Pelias and the daughters of Pelias, of\r\nAlcestis, who was the most charming of them all, and of her son\r\n\r\n       “Eumelus, whom Alcestis, praised\r\n   For beauty above all her sisters fair,\r\n   In Thessaly to king Admetus bore,”[287]\r\n\r\nand was yet ignorant of all that befell Jason, and Argo, and the\r\nArgonauts, matters on the actual occurrence of which all the world is\r\nagreed. The tale then of their voyage in the ocean from Æeta, was a mere\r\nfiction, for which he had no authority in history.\r\n\r\n39. If, however, the expedition to the Phasis, fitted out by Pelias, its\r\nreturn, and the conquest of several islands, have at the bottom any\r\ntruth whatever, as all say they have, so also has the account of their\r\nwanderings, no less than those of Ulysses and Menelaus; monuments of the\r\nactual occurrence of which remain to this day elsewhere than in the\r\nwritings of Homer. The city of Æa, close by the Phasis, is still pointed\r\nout. Æetes is generally believed to have reigned in Colchis, the name is\r\nstill common throughout the country, tales of the sorceress Medea are\r\nyet abroad, and the riches of the country in gold, silver, and iron,\r\nproclaim the motive of Jason’s expedition, as well as of that which\r\nPhrixus had formerly undertaken. Traces both of one and the other still\r\nremain. Such is Phrixium,[288] midway between Colchis and Iberia, and\r\nthe Jasonia, or towns of Jason, which are every where met with in\r\nArmenia, Media, and the surrounding countries. Many are the witnesses to\r\nthe reality of the expeditions of Jason and Phrixus at Sinope[289] and\r\nits shore, at Propontis, at the Hellespont, and even at Lemnos. Of Jason\r\nand his Colchian followers there are traces even as far as Crete,[290]\r\nItaly, and the Adriatic. Callimachus himself alludes to it where he\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n   ”[The temple of] Apollo and [the Isle of] Anaphe,[291]\r\n   Near to Laconian Thera.”[292]\r\n\r\nIn the verses which commence,\r\n\r\n   “I sing how the heroes from Cytæan Æeta,\r\n   Return’d again to ancient Æmonia.”[293]\r\n\r\nAnd again concerning the Colchians, who,\r\n\r\n   “Ceasing to plough with oars the Illyrian Sea,[294]\r\n   Near to the tomb of fair Harmonia,\r\n   Who was transform’d into a dragon’s shape,\r\n   Founded their city, which a Greek would call\r\n   The Town of Fugitives, but in their tongue\r\n   Is Pola named.”\r\n\r\nSome writers assert that Jason and his companions sailed high up the\r\nIster, others say he sailed only so far as to be able to gain the\r\nAdriatic: the first statement results altogether from ignorance; the\r\nsecond, which supposes there is a second Ister having its source from\r\nthe larger river of the same name, and discharging its waters into the\r\nAdriatic, is neither incredible nor even improbable.[295]\r\n\r\n40. Starting from these premises, the poet, in conformity both with\r\ngeneral custom and his own practice, narrates some circumstances as they\r\nactually occurred, and paints others in the colours of fiction. He\r\nfollows history when he tells us of Æetes and Jason also, when he talks\r\nof Argo, and on the authority of [the actual city of Æa], feigns his\r\ncity of Ææa, when he settles Euneos in Lemnos, and makes that island\r\nfriendly to Achilles, and when, in imitation of Medea, he makes the\r\nsorceress Circe\r\n\r\n   “Sister by birth of the all-wise Æetes,”[296]\r\n\r\nhe adds the fiction of the entrance of the Argonauts into the exterior\r\nocean as the sequel to their wanderings on their return home. Here,\r\nsupposing the previous statements admitted, the truth of the phrase “the\r\nrenowned Argo,”[297] is evident, since, in that case, the expedition\r\nwas directed to a populous and well-known country. But if, as\r\n[Demetrius] of Skepsis asserts, on the authority of Mimnermus, Æetes\r\ndwelt by the Ocean, and Jason was sent thither far east by Pelias, to\r\nbring back the fleece, it neither seems probable that such an expedition\r\nwould have been undertaken into unknown and obscure countries after the\r\nFleece, nor could a voyage to lands desert, uninhabited, and so far\r\nremote from us, be considered either glorious or renowned.\r\n\r\n[Here follow the words of Demetrius.]\r\n\r\n   “Nor as yet had Jason, having accomplished the arduous journey,\r\n   carried off the splendid fleece from Æa, fulfilling the dangerous\r\n   mission of the insolent Pelias, nor had they ploughed the\r\n   glorious wave of the ocean.”\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n   “The city of Æetes, where the rays of the swift sun recline on\r\n   their golden bed by the shore of the ocean, which the noble Jason\r\n   visited.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Eratosthenes is guilty of another fault in so frequently referring to\r\nthe works of men beneath his notice, sometimes for the purpose of\r\nrefuting them; at others, when he agrees with them, in order to cite\r\nthem as authorities. I allude to Damastes, and such as him, who even\r\nwhen they speak the truth, are utterly unworthy of being appealed to as\r\nauthorities, or vouchers for the credibility of a statement. For such\r\npurposes the writings of trustworthy men should only be employed, who\r\nhave accurately described much; and though perhaps they may have omitted\r\nmany points altogether, and barely touched on others, are yet never\r\nguilty of wilfully falsifying their statements. To cite Damastes as an\r\nauthority is little better than to quote the Bergæan,[298] or Euemerus\r\nthe Messenian, and those other scribblers whom Eratosthenes himself\r\nsneers at for their absurdities. Why, he even points out as one of the\r\nfollies of this Damastes, his observation that the Arabian Gulf was a\r\nlake;[299] likewise the statement that Diotimus, the son of Strombicus\r\nand chief of the Athenian legation, sailed through Cilicia up the\r\nCydnus[300] into the river Choaspes,[301] which flows by Susa,[302] and\r\nso arrived at that capital after forty days’ journey. This particular he\r\nprofesses to state on the authority of Diotimus himself, and then\r\nexpresses his wonder whether the Cydnus could actually cross the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris in order to disgorge itself into the Choaspes.[303]\r\n\r\n2. However, this is not all we have to say against him. Of many places\r\nhe tells us that nothing is known, when in fact they have every one been\r\naccurately described. Then he warns us to be very cautious in believing\r\nwhat we are told on such matters, and endeavours by long and tedious\r\narguments to show the value of his advice; swallowing at the same time\r\nthe most ridiculous absurdities himself concerning the Euxine and\r\nAdriatic. Thus he believed the Bay of Issus[304] to be the most easterly\r\npoint of the Mediterranean, though Dioscurias,[305] which is nearly at\r\nthe bottom of the Pontus Euxinus, is, according to his own calculations,\r\nfarther east by a distance of 3000 stadia.[306] In describing the\r\nnorthern and farther parts of the Adriatic he cannot refrain from\r\nsimilar romancing, and gives credit to many strange narrations\r\nconcerning what lies beyond the Pillars of Hercules, informing us of an\r\nIsle of Kerne there, and other places now nowhere to be found, which we\r\nshall speak of presently.\r\n\r\nHaving remarked that the ancients, whether out on piratical excursions,\r\nor for the purposes of commerce, never ventured into the high seas, but\r\ncrept along the coast, and instancing Jason, who leaving his vessels at\r\nColchis penetrated into Armenia and Media on foot, he proceeds to tell\r\nus that formerly no one dared to navigate either the Euxine or the seas\r\nby Libya, Syria, and Cilicia. If by _formerly_ he means periods so long\r\npast that we possess no record of them, it is of little consequence to\r\nus whether they navigated those seas or not, but if [he speaks] of times\r\nof which we know any thing, and if we are to place any trust in the\r\naccounts which have come down to us, every one will admit that the\r\nancients appear to have made longer journeys both by sea and land than\r\ntheir successors; witness Bacchus, Hercules, nay Jason himself, and\r\nagain Ulysses and Menelaus, of whom Homer tells us. It seems most\r\nprobable that Theseus and Pirithous are indebted to some long voyages\r\nfor the credit they afterwards obtained of having visited the infernal\r\nregions; and in like manner the Dioscuri[307] gained the appellation of\r\nguardians of the sea, and the deliverers of sailors.[308] The\r\nsovereignty of the seas exercised by Minos, and the navigation carried\r\non by the Phœnicians, is well known. A little after the period of the\r\nTrojan war they had penetrated beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and\r\nfounded cities as well there as to the midst of the African coast.[309]\r\nIs it not correct to number amongst the ancients Æneas,[310]\r\nAntenor,[311] the Heneti, and all the crowd of warriors, who, after the\r\ndestruction of Troy, wandered over the face of the whole earth? For at\r\nthe conclusion of the war both the Greeks and Barbarians found\r\nthemselves deprived, the one of their livelihood at home, the other of\r\nthe fruits of their expedition; so that when Troy was overthrown, the\r\nvictors, and still more the vanquished, who had survived the conflict,\r\nwere compelled by want to a life of piracy; and we learn that they\r\nbecame the founders of many cities along the sea-coast beyond\r\nGreece,[312] besides several inland settlements.[313]\r\n\r\n3. Again, having discoursed on the advance of knowledge respecting the\r\nGeography of the inhabited earth, between the time of Alexander and the\r\nperiod when he was writing, Eratosthenes goes into a description of the\r\nfigure of the earth; not merely of the habitable earth, an account of\r\nwhich would have been very suitable, but of the whole earth, which\r\nshould certainly have been given too, but not in this disorderly manner.\r\nHe proceeds to tell us that the earth is spheroidal, not however\r\nperfectly so, inasmuch as it has certain irregularities, he then\r\nenlarges on the successive changes of its form, occasioned by water,\r\nfire, earthquakes, eruptions, and the like; all of which is entirely out\r\nof place, for the spheroidal form of the whole earth is the result of\r\nthe system of the universe, and the phenomena which he mentions do not\r\nin the least change its general form; such little matters being entirely\r\nlost in the great mass of the earth. Still they cause various\r\npeculiarities in different parts of our globe, and result from a variety\r\nof causes.\r\n\r\n4. He points out as a most interesting subject for disquisition the fact\r\nof our finding, often quite inland, two or three thousand stadia from\r\nthe sea, vast numbers of muscle, oyster, and scallop-shells, and\r\nsalt-water lakes.[314] He gives as an instance, that about the temple\r\nof Ammon,[315] and along the road to it for the space of 3000 stadia,\r\nthere are yet found a vast amount of oyster shells, many salt-beds, and\r\nsalt springs bubbling up, besides which are pointed out numerous\r\nfragments of wreck which they say have been cast up through some\r\nopening, and dolphins placed on pedestals with the inscription, Of the\r\ndelegates from Cyrene. Herein he agrees with the opinion of Strato the\r\nnatural philosopher, and Xanthus of Lydia. Xanthus mentioned that in the\r\nreign of Artaxerxes there was so great a drought, that every river,\r\nlake, and well was dried up: and that in many places he had seen a long\r\nway from the sea fossil shells, some like cockles, others resembling\r\nscallop shells, also salt lakes in Armenia, Matiana,[316] and Lower\r\nPhrygia, which induced him to believe that sea had formerly been where\r\nthe land now was. Strato, who went more deeply into the causes of these\r\nphenomena, was of opinion that formerly there was no exit to the Euxine\r\nas now at Byzantium, but that the rivers running into it had forced a\r\nway through, and thus let the waters escape into the Propontis, and\r\nthence to the Hellespont.[317] And that a like change had occurred in\r\nthe Mediterranean. For the sea being overflowed by the rivers, had\r\nopened for itself a passage by the Pillars of Hercules, and thus, much\r\nthat was formerly covered by water, had been left dry.[318] He gives as\r\nthe cause of this, that anciently the levels of the Mediterranean and\r\nAtlantic were not the same, and states that a bank of earth, the remains\r\nof the ancient separation of the two seas, is still stretched under\r\nwater from Europe to Africa. He adds, that the Euxine is the most\r\nshallow, and the seas of Crete, Sicily, and Sardinia much deeper, which\r\nis occasioned by the number of large rivers flowing into the Euxine\r\nboth from the north and east, and so filling it up with mud, whilst the\r\nothers preserve their depth. This is the cause of the remarkable\r\nsweetness of the Euxine Sea, and of the currents which regularly set\r\ntowards the deepest part. He gives it as his opinion, that should the\r\nrivers continue to flow in the same direction, the Euxine will in time\r\nbe filled up [by the deposits], since already the left side of the sea\r\nis little else than shallows, as also Salmydessus,[319] and the shoals\r\nat the mouth of the Ister, and the desert of Scythia,[320] which the\r\nsailors call the Breasts. Probably too the temple of Ammon was\r\noriginally close to the sea, though now, by the continual deposit of the\r\nwaters, it is quite inland: and he conjectures that it was owing to its\r\nbeing so near the sea that it became so celebrated and illustrious, and\r\nthat it never would have enjoyed the credit it now possesses had it\r\nalways been equally remote from the sea. Egypt too [he says] was\r\nformerly covered by sea as far as the marshes near Pelusium,[321] Mount\r\nCasius,[322] and the Lake Sirbonis.[323] Even at the present time, when\r\nsalt is being dug in Egypt, the beds are found under layers of sand and\r\nmingled with fossil shells, as if this district had formerly been under\r\nwater, and as if the whole region about Casium and Gerrha[324] had been\r\nshallows reaching to the Arabian Gulf. The sea afterwards receding left\r\nthe land uncovered, and the Lake Sirbonis remained, which having\r\nafterwards forced itself a passage, became a marsh. In like manner the\r\nborders of the Lake Mœris resemble a sea-beach rather than the banks of\r\na river. Every one will admit that formerly at various periods a great\r\nportion of the mainland has been covered and again left bare by the sea.\r\nLikewise that the land now covered by the sea is not all on the same\r\nlevel, any more than that whereon we dwell; which is now uncovered and\r\nhas experienced so many changes, as Eratosthenes has observed.\r\nConsequently in the reasoning of Xanthus there does not appear to be any\r\nthing out of place.\r\n\r\n5. In regard to Strato, however, we must remark that, leaving out of the\r\nquestion the many arguments he has properly stated, some of those which\r\nhe has brought forward are quite inadmissible. For first he is\r\ninaccurate in stating that the beds of the interior and the exterior\r\nseas have not the same level, and that the depth of those two seas is\r\ndifferent: whereas the cause why the sea is at one time raised, at\r\nanother depressed, that it inundates certain places and again retreats,\r\nis not that the beds have different levels, some higher and some lower,\r\nbut simply this, that the same beds are at one time raised, at another\r\ndepressed, causing the sea to rise or subside with them; for having\r\nrisen they cause an inundation, and when they subside the waters return\r\nto their former places. For if it is so, an inundation will of course\r\naccompany every sudden increase of the waters of the sea, [as in the\r\nspring-tides,] or the periodical swelling of rivers, in the one instance\r\nthe waters being brought together from distant parts of the ocean, in\r\nthe other, their volume being increased. But the risings of rivers are\r\nnot violent and sudden, nor do the tides continue any length of time,\r\nnor occur irregularly; nor yet along the coasts of our sea do they cause\r\ninundations, nor any where else. Consequently we must seek for an\r\nexplanation of the cause either in the stratum composing the bed of the\r\nsea, or in that which is overflowed; we prefer to look for it in the\r\nformer, since by reason of its humidity it is more liable to shiftings\r\nand sudden changes of position, and we shall find that in these matters\r\nthe wind is the great agent after all. But, I repeat it, the immediate\r\ncause of these phenomena, is not in the fact of one part of the bed of\r\nthe ocean being higher or lower than another, but in the upheaving or\r\ndepression of the strata on which the waters rest. Strato’s hypothesis\r\nevidently originated in the belief that that which occurs in rivers is\r\nalso the case in regard to the sea; viz. that there is a flow of water\r\nfrom the higher places. Otherwise he would not have attempted to account\r\nfor the current he observed at the Strait of Byzantium in the manner he\r\ndoes, attributing it to the bed of the Euxine being higher than that of\r\nthe Propontis and adjoining ocean, and even attempting to explain the\r\ncause thereof: viz. that the bed of the Euxine is filled up and choked\r\nby the deposit of the rivers which flow into it; and its waters in\r\nconsequence driven out into the neighbouring sea. The same theory he\r\nwould apply in respect to the Mediterranean and Atlantic, alleging that\r\nthe bed of the former is higher than that of the latter in consequence\r\nof the number of rivers which flow into it, and the alluvium they carry\r\nalong with them. In that case there ought to be a like influx at the\r\nPillars and Calpe,[325] as there is at Byzantium. But I waive this\r\nobjection, as it might be asserted that the influx was the same in both\r\nplaces, but owing to the interference of the ebb and flow of the sea,\r\nbecame imperceptible.\r\n\r\n6. I rather make this inquiry:—If there were any reason why, before the\r\noutlet was opened at Byzantium, the bed of the Euxine (being deeper than\r\neither that of the Propontis[326] or of the adjoining sea[327]) should\r\nnot gradually have become more shallow by the deposit of the rivers\r\nwhich flow into it, allowing it formerly either to have been a sea, or\r\nmerely a vast lake greater than the Palus Mæotis? This proposition being\r\nconceded, I would next ask, whether before this the bed of the Euxine\r\nwould not have been brought to the same level as the Propontis, and in\r\nthat case, the pressure being counter-poised, the overflowing of the\r\nwater have been thus avoided; and if after the Euxine had been filled\r\nup, the superfluous waters would not naturally have forced a passage and\r\nflowed off, and by their commingling and power have caused the Euxine\r\nand Propontis to flow into each other, and thus become one sea? no\r\nmatter, as I said above, whether formerly it were a sea or a lake,\r\nthough latterly certainly a sea. This also being conceded, they must\r\nallow that the present efflux depends neither upon the elevation nor the\r\ninclination of the bed, as Strato’s theory would have us consider it.\r\n\r\n7. We would apply the same arguments to the whole of the Mediterranean\r\nand Atlantic, and account for the efflux of the former, not by any\r\n[supposed] difference between the elevation and inclination of its bed\r\nand of that of the Atlantic, but attribute it to the number of\r\nrivers which empty themselves into it. Since, according to this\r\nsupposition, it is not incredible that had the whole of the\r\nMediterranean Sea in times past been but a lake filled by the rivers,\r\nand having overflowed, it might have broken through the Strait at the\r\nPillars, as through a cataract; and still continuing to swell more and\r\nmore, the Atlantic in course of time would have become confluent by that\r\nchannel, and have run into one level, the Mediterranean thus becoming a\r\nsea. In fine, the Physician did wrong in comparing the sea to rivers,\r\nfor the latter are borne down as a descending stream, but the sea always\r\nmaintains its level. The currents of straits depend upon other causes,\r\nnot upon the accumulation of earth formed by the alluvial deposit from\r\nrivers, filling up the bed of the sea. This accumulation only goes on at\r\nthe mouths of rivers. Such are what are called the Stethe or Breasts at\r\nthe mouth of the Ister,[328] the desert of the Scythians, and\r\nSalmydessus, which are partially occasioned by other winter-torrents as\r\nwell; witness the sandy, low, and even coast of Colchis,[329] at the\r\nmouth of the Phasis,[330] the whole of the coast of Themiscyra,[331]\r\nnamed the plain of the Amazons, near the mouths of the Thermodon[332]\r\nand Iris,[333] and the greater part of Sidene.[334] It is the same with\r\nother rivers, they all resemble the Nile in forming an alluvial deposit\r\nat their mouths, some more, some less than others. Those rivers which\r\ncarry but little soil with them deposit least, while others, which\r\ntraverse an extended and soft country, and receive many torrents in\r\ntheir course, deposit the greatest quantity. Such for example is the\r\nriver Pyramus,[335] by which Cilicia has been considerably augmented,\r\nand concerning which an oracle has declared, “This shall occur when the\r\nwide waters of the Pyramus have enlarged their banks as far as sacred\r\nCyprus.”[336] This river becomes navigable from the middle of the plains\r\nof Cataonia, and entering Cilicia[337] by the defiles of the Taurus,\r\ndischarges itself into the sea which flows between that country and the\r\nisland of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n8. These river deposits are prevented from advancing further into the\r\nsea by the regularity of the ebb and flow, which continually drive them\r\nback. For after the manner of living creatures, which go on inhaling and\r\nexhaling their breath continually, so the sea in a like way keeps up a\r\nconstant motion in and out of itself. Any one may observe who stands on\r\nthe sea-shore when the waves are in motion, the regularity with which\r\nthey cover, then leave bare, and then again cover up his feet. This\r\nagitation of the sea produces a continual movement on its surface, which\r\neven when it is most tranquil has considerable force, and so throws all\r\nextraneous matters on to the land, and\r\n\r\n   “Flings forth the salt weed on the shore.”[338]\r\n\r\nThis effect is certainly most considerable when the wind is on the\r\nwater, but it continues when all is hushed, and even when it blows from\r\nland the swell is still carried to the shore against the wind, as if by\r\na peculiar motion of the sea itself. To this the verses refer—\r\n\r\n           “O’er the rocks that breast the flood\r\n   Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray,”[339]\r\n\r\nand,\r\n\r\n   “Loud sounds the roar of waves ejected wide.”[340]\r\n\r\n9. The wave, as it advances, possesses a kind of power, which some call\r\nthe purging of the sea, to eject all foreign substances. It is by this\r\nforce that dead bodies and wrecks are cast on shore. But on retiring it\r\ndoes not possess sufficient power to carry back into the sea either dead\r\nbodies, wood, or even the lightest substances, such as cork, which may\r\nhave been cast out by the waves. And by this means when places next the\r\nsea fall down, being undermined by the wave, the earth and the water\r\ncharged with it are cast back again; and the weight [of the mud] working\r\nat the same time in conjunction with the force of the advancing tide, it\r\nis the sooner brought to settle at the bottom, instead of being carried\r\nout far into the sea. The force of the river current ceases at a very\r\nlittle distance beyond its mouth. Otherwise, supposing the rivers had an\r\nuninterrupted flow, by degrees the whole ocean would be filled in, from\r\nthe beach onwards, by the alluvial deposits. And this would be\r\ninevitable even were the Euxine deeper than the sea of Sardinia, than\r\nwhich a deeper sea has never been sounded, measuring, as it does,\r\naccording to Posidonius, about 1000 fathoms.[341]\r\n\r\n10. Some, however, may be disinclined to admit this explanation, and\r\nwould rather have proof from things more manifest to the senses, and\r\nwhich seem to meet us at every turn. Now deluges, earthquakes, eruptions\r\nof wind, and risings in the bed of the sea, these things cause the\r\nrising of the ocean, as sinking of the bottom causes it to become lower.\r\nIt is not the case that small volcanic or other islands can be raised up\r\nfrom the sea, and not large ones, nor that all islands can, but not\r\ncontinents, since extensive sinkings of the land no less than small ones\r\nhave been known; witness the yawning of those chasms which have ingulfed\r\nwhole districts no less than their cities, as is said to have happened\r\nto Bura,[342] Bizone,[343] and many other towns at the time of\r\nearthquakes: and there is no more reason why one should rather think\r\nSicily to have been disjoined from the mainland of Italy than cast up\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea by the fires of Ætna, as the Lipari and\r\nPithecussan[344] Isles have been.\r\n\r\n11. However, so nice a fellow is Eratosthenes, that though he professes\r\nhimself a mathematician,[345] he rejects entirely the dictum of\r\nArchimedes, who, in his work “On Bodies in Suspension,” says that all\r\nliquids when left at rest assume a spherical form, having a centre of\r\ngravity similar to that of the earth. A dictum which is acknowledged by\r\nall who have the slightest pretensions to mathematical sagacity. He says\r\nthat the Mediterranean, which, according to his own description, is one\r\nentire sea has not the same level even at points quite close to each\r\nother; and offers us the authority of engineers for this piece of folly,\r\nnotwithstanding the affirmation of mathematicians that engineering is\r\nitself only one division of the mathematics. He tells us that\r\nDemetrius[346] intended to cut through the Isthmus of Corinth, to open a\r\npassage for his fleet, but was prevented by his engineers, who, having\r\ntaken measurements, reported that the level of the sea at the Gulf of\r\nCorinth was higher than at Cenchrea,[347] so that if he cut through the\r\nisthmus, not only the coasts near Ægina, but even Ægina itself, with the\r\nneighbouring islands, would be laid completely under water, while the\r\npassage would prove of little value. According to Eratosthenes, it is\r\nthis which occasions the current in straits, especially the current in\r\nthe Strait of Sicily,[348] where effects similar to the flow and ebb of\r\nthe tide are remarked. The current there changes twice in the course of\r\na day and night, like as in that period the tides of the sea flow and\r\nebb twice. In the Tyrrhenian sea[349] the current which is called\r\ndescendent, and which runs towards the sea of Sicily, as if it followed\r\nan inclined plane, corresponds to the flow of the tide in the ocean. We\r\nmay remark, that this current corresponds to the flow both in the time\r\nof its commencement and cessation. For it commences at the rising and\r\nsetting of the moon, and recedes when that satellite attains its\r\nmeridian, whether above [in the zenith] or below the earth [in the\r\nnadir]. In the same way occurs the opposite or ascending current, as it\r\nis called. It corresponds to the ebb of the ocean, and commences as\r\nsoon as the moon has reached either zenith or nadir, and ceases the\r\nmoment she reaches the point of her rising or setting. [So far\r\nEratosthenes.]\r\n\r\n12. The nature of the ebb and flow has been sufficiently treated of by\r\nPosidonius and Athenodorus. Concerning the flux and reflux of the\r\ncurrents, which also may be explained by physics, it will suffice our\r\npresent purpose to observe, that in the various straits these do not\r\nresemble each other, but each strait has its own peculiar current. Were\r\nthey to resemble each other, the current at the Strait of Sicily[350]\r\nwould not change merely twice during the day, (as Eratosthenes himself\r\ntells us it does,) and at Chalcis seven times;[351] nor again that of\r\nConstantinople, which does not change at all, but runs always in one\r\ndirection from the Euxine to the Propontis, and, as Hipparchus tells us,\r\nsometimes ceases altogether. However, if they did all depend on one\r\ncause, it would not be that which Eratosthenes has assigned, namely,\r\nthat the various seas have different levels. The kind of inequality he\r\nsupposes would not even be found in rivers only for the cataracts; and\r\nwhere these cataracts occur, they occasion no ebbing, but have one\r\ncontinued downward flow, which is caused by the inclination both of the\r\nflow and the surface; and therefore though they have no flux or reflux\r\nthey do not remain still, on account of a principle of flowing which is\r\ninherent in them; at the same time they cannot be on the same level, but\r\none must be higher and one lower than another. But who ever imagined the\r\nsurface of the ocean to be on a slope, especially those who follow a\r\nsystem which supposes the four bodies we call elementary, to be\r\nspherical.[352] For water is not like the earth, which being of a solid\r\nnature is capable of permanent depressions and risings, but by its force\r\nof gravity spreads equally over the earth, and assumes that kind of\r\nlevel which Archimedes has assigned it.\r\n\r\n13. To what we cited before concerning the temple of Ammon and Egypt,\r\nEratosthenes adds, that to judge from appearances, Mount Casius[353] was\r\nformerly covered by sea, and the whole district now known as Gerra lay\r\nunder shoal water touching the bay of the Erythræan Sea,[354] but was\r\nleft dry on the union[355] of the [Mediterranean] Sea [with the ocean].\r\nA certain amphibology lurks here under this description of the district\r\nlying under shoal water and touching the bay of the Erythræan Sea; for\r\nto touch[356] both means to be close to, and also to be in actual\r\ncontact with, so that when applied to water it would signify that one\r\nflows into the other. I understand him to mean, that so long as the\r\nstrait by the Pillars of Hercules remained closed, these marshes covered\r\nwith shoal-water extended as far as the Arabian Gulf, but on that\r\npassage being forced open, the Mediterranean, discharging itself by the\r\nstrait, became lower, and the land was left dry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Hipparchus understands by the term _touching_, that\r\nthe Mediterranean, being over-full, flowed into the Erythræan Sea, and\r\nhe inquires how it could happen, that as the Mediterranean flowed out by\r\nthis new vent at the Pillars of Hercules, the Erythræan Sea, which was\r\nall one with it, did not flow away too, and thus become lower, but has\r\nalways retained the same level? and since Eratosthenes supposes the\r\nwhole exterior sea to be confluent, it follows that the Western\r\nOcean[357] and the Erythræan Sea are all one; and thus [remarks\r\nHipparchus] as a necessary consequence, the sea beyond the Pillars of\r\nHercules, the Erythræan Sea, and that also which is confluent with\r\nit,[358] have all the same level.\r\n\r\n14. But, Eratosthenes would reply, I never said that, in consequence of\r\nthe repletion of the Mediterranean, it actually flowed into the\r\nErythræan Sea, but only that it approached very near thereto: besides,\r\nit does not follow, that in one and the self-same sea, the level of its\r\nsurface must be all the same; to instance the Mediterranean itself, no\r\none, surely, will say it is of the same height at Lechæum[359] and at\r\nCenchrea.[360] This answer Hipparchus anticipated in his Critique; and\r\nbeing aware of the opinion of Eratosthenes, was justified in attacking\r\nhis arguments. But he ought not to have taken it for granted, that when\r\nEratosthenes said the exterior sea was all one, he necessarily implied\r\nthat its level was every where the same.\r\n\r\n15. Hipparchus rejects as false the [account] of the inscription on the\r\ndolphins “by the delegates from Cyrene,” but the reason he assigns for\r\nthis is insufficient, viz. that though Cyrene was built in times of\r\nwhich we have record, no one mentions the oracle,[361] as being situated\r\non the sea-shore. But what matters is that no historian has recorded\r\nthis, when amongst the other proofs from which we infer that this place\r\nwas formerly on the sea-shore, we number this of the dolphins which were\r\nset up, and the inscription, “by the delegates from Cyrene?”[362]\r\nHipparchus agrees that if the bottom of the sea were raised up, it would\r\nlift the water with it, and might therefore overflow the land as far as\r\nthe locality of the oracle, or more than 3000 stadia from the shore; but\r\nhe will not allow that the rising would be sufficient to overflow the\r\nIsland of Pharos and the major portion of Egypt, since [he says] the\r\nelevation would not be sufficient to submerge these. He alleges that if\r\nbefore the opening of the passage at the Pillars of Hercules, the\r\nMediterranean had been swollen to such an extent as Eratosthenes\r\naffirms, the whole of Libya, and the greater part of Europe and Asia,\r\nmust long ago have been buried beneath its waves. Besides, he adds, in\r\nthis case the Euxine would in certain places have been connected with\r\nthe Adriatic, since in the vicinity of the Euxine, [near to its\r\nsource,][363] the Ister is divided in its course, and flows into either\r\nsea, owing to the peculiarities of the ground.[364] To this we object,\r\nthat the Ister does not take its rise at all in the vicinity of the\r\nEuxine, but, on the contrary, beyond the mountains of the Adriatic;\r\nneither does it flow into both the seas, but into the Euxine alone, and\r\nonly becomes divided just above its mouths. This latter, however, was an\r\nerror into which he fell in common with many of his predecessors. They\r\nsupposed that there was another river in addition to the former Ister,\r\nbearing the same name, which emptied itself into the Adriatic, and from\r\nwhich the country of Istria, through which it flowed, gained that\r\nappellation. It was by this river they believed Jason returned on his\r\nvoyage from Colchis.\r\n\r\n16. In order to lessen surprise at such changes as we have mentioned as\r\ncauses of the inundations and other similar phenomena which are supposed\r\nto have produced Sicily, the islands of Æolus,[365] and the Pithecussæ,\r\nit may be as well to compare with these others of a similar nature,\r\nwhich either now are, or else have been observed in other localities. A\r\nlarge array of such facts placed at once before the eye would serve to\r\nallay our astonishment; while that which is uncommon startles our\r\nperception, and manifests our general ignorance of the occurrences which\r\ntake place in nature and physical existence. For instance, supposing any\r\none should narrate the circumstances concerning Thera and the Therasian\r\nIslands, situated in the strait between Crete and the Cyrenaic,[366]\r\nThera being itself the metropolis of Cyrene; or those [in connexion\r\nwith] Egypt, and many parts of Greece. For midway between Thera and\r\nTherasia flames rushed forth from the sea for the space of four days;\r\ncausing the whole of it to boil and be all on fire; and after a little\r\nan island twelve stadia in circumference, composed of the burning mass,\r\nwas thrown up, as if raised by machinery. After the cessation of this\r\nphenomenon, the Rhodians, then masters of the sea, were the first who\r\ndared to sail to the place, and they built there on the island a temple\r\nto the Asphalian[367] Neptune. Posidonius remarks, that during an\r\nearthquake which occurred in Phœnicia, a city situated above Sidon was\r\nswallowed up, and that nearly two-thirds of Sidon also fell, but not\r\nsuddenly, and therefore with no great loss of life. That the same\r\noccurred, though in a lighter form, throughout nearly the whole of\r\nSyria, and was felt even in some of the Cyclades and the Island of\r\nEubœa,[368] so that the fountains of Arethusa, a spring in Chalcis, were\r\ncompletely obstructed, and after some time forced for themselves another\r\nopening, and the whole island ceased not to experience shocks until a\r\nchasm was rent open in the earth in the plain of Lelanto,[369] from\r\nwhich poured a river of burning mud.\r\n\r\n17. Many writers have recorded similar occurrences, but it will suffice\r\nus to narrate those which have been collected by Demetrius of Skepsis.\r\n\r\nApropos of that passage of Homer:—\r\n\r\n   “And now they reach’d the running rivulets clear,\r\n   Where from Scamander’s dizzy flood arise\r\n   Two fountains, tepid one, from which a smoke\r\n   Issues voluminous as from a fire,\r\n   The other, even in summer heats, like hail\r\n   For cold, or snow, or crystal stream frost-bound:”[370]\r\n\r\nthis writer tells us we must not be surprised, that although the cold\r\nspring still remains, the hot cannot be discovered; and says we must\r\nreckon the failing of the hot spring as the cause. He goes on to relate\r\ncertain catastrophes recorded by Democles, how formerly in the reign of\r\nTantalus[371] there were great earthquakes in Lydia and Ionia as far as\r\nthe Troad,[372] which swallowed up whole villages and overturned Mount\r\nSipylus;[373] marshes then became lakes, and the city of Troy was\r\ncovered by the waters.[374] Pharos, near Egypt, which anciently was an\r\nisland, may now be called a peninsula, and the same may be said of Tyre\r\nand Clazomenæ.[375]\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Alexandria in Egypt the sea rose so high near\r\nPelusium[376] and Mount Casius[377] as to overflow the land, and convert\r\nthe mountain into an island, so that a journey from Casius into Phœnicia\r\nmight have been undertaken by water. We should not be surprised\r\ntherefore if in time to come the isthmus[378] which separates the\r\nEgyptian sea[379] from the Erythræan,[380] should part asunder or\r\nsubside, and becoming a strait, connect the outer and inner seas,[381]\r\nsimilarly to what has taken place at the strait of the Pillars.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this work will be found some other narrations of\r\na similar kind, which should be considered at the same time, and which\r\nwill greatly tend to strengthen our belief both in these works of nature\r\nand also in its other changes.\r\n\r\n18. The Piræus having been formerly an island, and lying πέραν, or off\r\nthe shore, is said to have thus received its name. Leucas,[382] on the\r\ncontrary, has been made an island by the Corinthians, who cut through\r\nthe isthmus which connected it with the shore [of the mainland]. It is\r\nconcerning this place that Laertes is made to say,\r\n\r\n               “Oh that I possess’d\r\n   Such vigour now as when in arms I took\r\n   Nericus, continental city fair.”[383]\r\n\r\nHere man devoted his labour to make a separation, in other instances to\r\nthe construction of moles and bridges. Such is that which connects the\r\nisland opposite to Syracuse[384] with the mainland. This junction is now\r\neffected by means of a bridge, but formerly, according to Ibycus, by a\r\npier of picked stones, which he calls _elect_. Of Bura[385] and\r\nHelice,[386] one has been swallowed by an earthquake, the other covered\r\nby the waves. Near to Methone,[387] which is on the Hermionic Gulf,[388]\r\na mountain seven stadia in height was cast up during a fiery eruption;\r\nduring the day it could not be approached on account of the heat and\r\nsulphureous smell; at night it emitted an agreeable odour, appeared\r\nbrilliant at a distance, and was so hot that the sea boiled all around\r\nit to a distance of five stadia, and appeared in a state of agitation\r\nfor twenty stadia, the heap being formed of fragments of rock as large\r\nas towers. Both Arne and Mideia[389] have been buried in the waters of\r\nLake Copaïs.[390] These towns the poet in his Catalogue[391] thus speaks\r\nof;\r\n\r\n                         “Arne claims\r\n   A record next for her illustrious sons,\r\n   Vine-bearing Arne. Thou wast also there\r\n   Mideia.”[392]\r\n\r\nIt seems that several Thracian cities have been submerged by the Lake\r\nBistonis,[393] and that now called Aphnitis.[394] Some also affirm that\r\ncertain cities of Trerus were also overwhelmed, in the neighbourhood of\r\nThrace. Artemita, formerly one of the Echinades,[395] is now part of the\r\nmainland; the same has happened to some other of the islets near the\r\nAchelous, occasioned, it is said, in the same way, by the alluvium\r\ncarried into the sea by that river, and Hesiod[396] assures us that a\r\nlike fate awaits them all. Some of the Ætolian promontories were\r\nformerly islands. Asteria,[397] called by Homer Asteris, is no longer\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\n                     “There is a rocky isle\r\n   In the mid-sea, Samos the rude between\r\n   And Ithaca, not large, named Asteris.\r\n   It hath commodious havens, into which\r\n   A passage clear opens on either side.”[398]\r\n\r\nThere is no good anchorage there now. Neither is there in Ithaca the\r\ncavern, nor yet the temple of the nymphs described to us by Homer. It\r\nseems more correct to attribute this to change having come over the\r\nplaces, than either to the ignorance or the romancing of the poet. This\r\nhowever, being uncertain, must be left to every man’s opinion.\r\n\r\n19. Myrsilus tells us that Antissa[399] was formerly an island, and so\r\ncalled because it was opposite to Lesbos,[400] then named Issa. Now,\r\nhowever, it forms one of the towns of Lesbos.[401] Some have believed\r\nthat Lesbos itself has been disjoined from Mount Ida in the same way as\r\nProchytas[402] and Pithecussa[403] from Misenum,[404] Capreæ[405] from\r\nthe Athenæum, Sicily from Rhegium,[406] and Ossa from Olympus.[407]\r\nMany changes similar to these have occurred elsewhere. The river Ladon\r\nin Arcadia ceased for some time its flow. Duris informs us that the\r\nRhagæ[408] in Media gained that appellation from chasms made in the\r\nground near the Gates of the Caspian[409] by earthquakes, in which many\r\ncities and villages were destroyed, and the rivers underwent various\r\nchanges. Ion, in his satirical composition of Omphale, has said of\r\nEubœa,\r\n\r\n   “The light wave of the Euripus has divided the land of Eubœa from\r\n   Bœotia; separating the projecting land by a strait.”\r\n\r\n20. Demetrius of Callatis, speaking of the earthquakes which formerly\r\noccurred throughout the whole of Greece, states that a great portion of\r\nthe Lichadian Islands and of Kenæum[410] were submerged; that the hot\r\nsprings of Ædepsus[411] and Thermopylæ were suppressed for three days,\r\nand that when they commenced to run again those of Ædepsus gushed from\r\nnew fountains. That at Oreus[412] on the sea-coast the wall and nearly\r\nseven hundred houses fell at once. That the greater part of\r\nEchinus,[413] Phalara,[414] and Heraclæa of Trachis[415] were thrown\r\ndown, Phalara being overturned from its very foundations. That almost\r\nthe same misfortune occurred to the Lamians[416] and inhabitants of\r\nLarissa; that Scarpheia[417] was overthrown from its foundations, not\r\nless than one thousand seven hundred persons being swallowed up, and at\r\nThronium[418] more than half that number. That a torrent of water\r\ngushed forth taking three directions, one to Scarphe and Thronium,\r\nanother to Thermopylæ, and a third to the plains of Daphnus in Phocis.\r\nThat the springs of [many] rivers were for several days dried up; that\r\nthe course of the Sperchius[419] was changed, thus rendering navigable\r\nwhat formerly were highways; that the Boagrius[420] flowed through\r\nanother channel; that many parts of Alope, Cynus, and Opus were\r\ninjured,[421] and the castle of Œum, which commands the latter city,\r\nentirely overturned. That part of the wall of Elateia[422] was thrown\r\ndown; and that at Alponus,[423] during the celebration of the games in\r\nhonour of Ceres, twenty-five maidens, who had mounted a tower to enjoy\r\nthe show exhibited in the port, were precipitated into the sea by the\r\nfalling of the tower. They also record that a large fissure was made [by\r\nthe water] through the midst of the island of Atalanta,[424] opposite\r\nEubœa,[425] sufficient for ships to sail in; that the course of the\r\nchannel was in places as broad as twenty stadia between the plains; and\r\nthat a trireme being raised [thereby] out of the docks, was carried over\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\n21. Those who desire to instil into us that more perfect freedom from\r\n[ignorant] wonder, which Democritus and all other philosophers so highly\r\nextol, should add the changes which have been produced by the migrations\r\nof various tribes: we should thus be inspired with courage, steadiness,\r\nand composure. For instance, the Western Iberians,[426] removed to the\r\nregions beyond the Euxine and Colchis, being separated from Armenia,\r\naccording to Apollodorus, by the Araxes,[427] but rather by the\r\nCyrus[428] and Moschican mountains.[429] The expedition of the Egyptians\r\ninto Ethiopia[430] and Colchis. The migration of the Heneti,[431] who\r\npassed from Paphlagonia into the country bordering on the Adriatic Gulf.\r\nSimilar emigrations were also undertaken by the nations of Greece, the\r\nIonians, Dorians, Achaians, and Æolians; and the Ænians,[432] now next\r\nneighbours to the Ætolians, formerly dwelt near Dotium[433] and Ossa,\r\nbeyond the Perrhæbi;[434] the Perrhæbi too are but wanderers here\r\nthemselves. Our present work furnishes numerous instances of the same\r\nkind. Some of these are familiar to most readers, but the migrations of\r\nthe Carians, the Treres, the Teucrians, and the Galatæ or Gauls,[435]\r\nare not so generally known. Nor yet for the most part are the\r\nexpeditions of their chiefs, for instance, Madys the Scythian, Tearko\r\nthe Ethiopian, Cobus of Trerus, Sesostris and Psammeticus the Egyptians;\r\nnor are those of the Persians from Cyrus to Xerxes familiar to every\r\none. The Kimmerians, or a separate tribe of them, called the Treres,\r\nhave frequently overrun the countries to the right of the Euxine and\r\nthose adjacent to them, bursting now into Paphlagonia, now into Phrygia,\r\nas they did when, according to report, Midas[436] came to his death by\r\ndrinking bull’s blood. Lygdamis led his followers into Lydia, passed\r\nthrough Ionia, took Sardis, but was slain in Cilicia. The Kimmerians and\r\nTreres frequently made similar incursions, until at last, as it is\r\nreported, these latter, together with [their chief] Cobus, were driven\r\nout by Madys, king of the “Scythians.”[437] But enough has been said in\r\nthis place on the general history of the earth, as each country will\r\nhave a particular account.\r\n\r\n22. We must now return to the point whence we digressed. Herodotus\r\nhaving observed that there could be no such people as Hyperboreans,\r\ninasmuch as there were no Hypernotii,[438] Eratosthenes calls this\r\nargument ridiculous, and compares it to the sophism, that there are no\r\nepichærekaki,[439] inasmuch as there are no epichæragathi;[440] [adding]\r\nperhaps there are Hypernotii; since at all events in Ethiopia Notus does\r\nnot blow, although lower down it does.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be strange, since winds blow under every latitude, and\r\nespecially the southern wind called Notus, if any region could be found\r\nwhere this latter was not felt. On the contrary, not only does Ethiopia\r\nexperience our Notus, but also the whole country which lies above as far\r\nas the equator.[441]\r\n\r\nIf Herodotus must be blamed at all, it is for supposing that the\r\nHyperboreans were so named in consequence of Boreas, or the north wind,\r\nnot blowing upon them. The poets are allowed much licence in their modes\r\nof expression; but their commentators, who endeavour always to give us\r\nthe correct view, tell us that the people who dwelt in the extreme\r\nnorth, were styled Hyperboreans. The pole is the boundary of the\r\nnorthern winds, and the equator of the southern; these winds have no\r\nother limit.\r\n\r\n23. Eratosthenes next finds fault with the writers who fill their\r\nnarrative with stories evidently feigned and impossible; some as mere\r\nfable, but others as history, which did not deserve mention. In the\r\ndiscussion of a subject like his, he should not have wasted his time\r\nabout such trifles. Such is the way in which this writer completes the\r\nFirst Book of his Memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In his Second Book Eratosthenes endeavours to correct some errors in\r\ngeography, and offers his own views on the subject, any mistakes in\r\nwhich we shall endeavour in our turn to set right. He is correct in\r\nsaying that the inductions of mathematics and natural philosophy should\r\nbe employed, and that if the earth is spheroidal like the universe, it\r\nis inhabited in all parts; together with some other things of this\r\nnature. Later writers do not agree with him as to the size of the\r\nearth,[442] nor admit his measurement. However Hipparchus, when noting\r\nthe celestial appearances for each particular locality, adopts his\r\nadmeasurements, saying that those taken for the meridian of Meroe,[443]\r\nAlexandria, and the Dnieper, differ but very slightly from the truth.\r\nEratosthenes then enters into a long discussion concerning the figure of\r\nthe globe, proving that the form of the earth together with the water is\r\nspheroidal, as also the heavens. This however we imagine was foreign to\r\nhis purpose, and should have been disposed of in the compass of a few\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n2. After this he proceeds to determine the breadth of the habitable\r\nearth: he tells us, that measuring from the meridian of Meroe[444] to\r\nAlexandria, there are 10,000 stadia.\r\n\r\nFrom thence to the Hellespont[445] about 8100. Again; from thence to\r\nthe Dnieper, 5000; and thence to the parallel of Thule,[446] which\r\nPytheas says is six days’ sail north from Britain, and near the Frozen\r\nSea, other 11,500. To which if we add 3400 stadia above Meroe in order\r\nto include the Island of the Egyptians,[447] the Cinnamon country, and\r\nTaprobane,[448] there will be in all 38,000 stadia.\r\n\r\n3. We will let pass the rest of his distances, since they are something\r\nnear,—but that the Dnieper is under the same parallel as Thule, what\r\nman in his senses could ever agree to this? Pytheas, who has given us\r\nthe history of Thule, is known to be a man upon whom no reliance can be\r\nplaced, and other writers who have seen Britain and Ierne,[449] although\r\nthey tell us of many small islands round Britain, make no mention\r\nwhatever of Thule. The length of Britain itself is nearly the same as\r\nthat of Keltica,[450] opposite to which it extends. Altogether it is not\r\nmore than 5000 stadia in length, its outermost points corresponding to\r\nthose of the opposite continent. In fact the extreme points of the two\r\ncountries lie opposite to each other, the eastern extremity to the\r\neastern, and the western to the western: the eastern points are situated\r\nso close as to be within sight of each other, both at Kent and at the\r\nmouths of the Rhine. But Pytheas tells us that the island [of Britain]\r\nis more than 20,000 stadia in length, and that Kent is some days’ sail\r\nfrom France. With regard to the locality of the Ostimii, and the\r\ncountries beyond the Rhine,[451] as far as Scythia, he is altogether\r\nmistaken. The veracity of a writer who has been thus false in describing\r\ncountries with which we are well acquainted, should not be too much\r\ntrusted in regard to unknown places.\r\n\r\n4. Further, Hipparchus and many others are of opinion that the parallel\r\nof latitude of the Dnieper does not differ from that of Britain; since\r\nthat of Byzantium and Marseilles are the same. The degree of shadow from\r\nthe gnomon which Pytheas states he observed at Marseilles being exactly\r\nequal to that which Hipparchus says he found at Byzantium; the periods\r\nof observation being in both cases similar.[452] Now from Marseilles to\r\nthe centre of Britain is not more than 5000 stadia; and if from the\r\ncentre of Britain we advance north not more than 4000 stadia, we arrive\r\nat a temperature in which it is scarcely possible to exist. Such indeed\r\nis that of Ierne.[453] Consequently the far region in which Eratosthenes\r\nplaces Thule must be totally uninhabitable. By what guesswork he\r\narrived at the conclusion that between the latitude of Thule and the\r\nDnieper there was a distance of 11,500 stadia I am unable to divine.\r\n\r\n5. Eratosthenes being mistaken as to the breadth [of the habitable\r\nearth], is necessarily wrong as to its length. The most accurate\r\nobservers, both ancient and modern, agree that the known length of the\r\nhabitable earth is more than twice its breadth. Its length I take to be\r\nfrom the [eastern] extremity of India[454] to the [westernmost] point of\r\nSpain;[455] and its breadth from [the south of] Ethiopia to the latitude\r\nof Ierne. Eratosthenes, as we have said, reckoning its breadth from the\r\nextremity of Ethiopia to Thule, was forced to extend its length beyond\r\nthe true limits, that he might make it more than twice as long as the\r\nbreadth he had assigned to it. He says that India, measured where it is\r\nnarrowest,[456] is 16,000 stadia to the river Indus. If measured from\r\nits most prominent capes it extends 3000 more.[457] Thence to the\r\nCaspian Gates, 14,000. From the Caspian Gates to the Euphrates,[458]\r\n10,000. From the Euphrates to the Nile, 5000.[459] Thence to the\r\nCanopic[460] mouth, 1300. From the Canopic mouth to Carthage, 13,500.\r\nFrom thence to the Pillars at least 8000. Which make in all 70,800\r\nstadia. To these [he says] should be added the curvature of Europe\r\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, fronting the Iberians, and inclining\r\nwest, not less than 3000 stadia, and the headlands, including that of\r\nthe Ostimii, named Cabæum,[461] and the adjoining islands, the last of\r\nwhich, named Uxisama,[462] is distant, according to Pytheas, a three\r\ndays’ sail. But he added nothing to its length by enumerating these\r\nlast, viz. the headlands, including that of the Ostimii, the island of\r\nUxisama, and the rest; they are not situated so as affect the length of\r\nthe earth, for they all lie to the north, and belong to Keltica, not to\r\nIberia; indeed it seems but an invention of Pytheas. Lastly, to fall in\r\nwith the general opinion that the breadth ought not[463] to exceed half\r\nthe length, he adds to the stated measure of its length 2000 stadia\r\nwest, and as many east.\r\n\r\n6. Further, endeavouring to support the opinion that it is in accordance\r\nwith natural philosophy to reckon the greatest dimension of the\r\nhabitable earth from east to west, he says that, according to the laws\r\nof natural philosophy, the habitable earth ought to occupy a greater\r\nlength from east to west, than its breadth from north to south. The\r\ntemperate zone, which we have already designated as the longest zone, is\r\nthat which the mathematicians denominate a continuous circle returning\r\nupon itself. So that if the extent of the Atlantic Ocean were not an\r\nobstacle, we might easily pass by sea from Iberia to India,[464] still\r\nkeeping in the same parallel; the remaining portion of which parallel,\r\nmeasured as above in stadia, occupies more than a third of the whole\r\ncircle: since the parallel drawn through Athens,[465] on which we have\r\ntaken the distances from India to Iberia, does not contain in the whole\r\n200,000 stadia.\r\n\r\nHere too his reasoning is incorrect. For this speculation respecting\r\nthe temperate zone which we inhabit, and whereof the habitable earth is\r\na part, devolves properly on those who make mathematics their study. But\r\nit is not equally the province of one treating of the habitable earth.\r\nFor by this term we mean only that portion of the temperate zone where\r\nwe dwell, and with which we are acquainted. But it is quite possible\r\nthat in the temperate zone there may be two or even more habitable\r\nearths, especially near the circle of latitude which is drawn through\r\nAthens and the Atlantic Ocean. After this he returns to the form of the\r\nearth, which he again declares to be spheroidal. Here he exhibits the\r\nsame churlishness we have previously pointed out, and goes on abusing\r\nHomer in his old style. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n7. “There has been much argument respecting the continents. Some,\r\nconsidering them to be divided by the rivers Nile and Tanais,[466] have\r\ndescribed them as islands; while others suppose them to be peninsulas\r\nconnected by the isthmuses between the Caspian and the Euxine Seas, and\r\nbetween the Erythræan Sea[467] and Ecregma.”[468] He adds, that this\r\nquestion does not appear to him to be of any practical importance, but\r\nrather, as Democritus observed, a bone of contention for angry\r\nlitigants. Where there are no precise boundary marks, columns, or walls,\r\nas at Colyttus and Melitè,[469] it is easy for us to say such a place is\r\nColyttus, and such another Melitè; but not so easy to show the exact\r\nlimits: thus disputes have frequently arisen concerning certain\r\ndistricts; that, for instance, between the Argives and Lacedæmonians\r\nconcerning [the possession of] Thyrea,[470] and that between the\r\nAthenians and Bœotians relative to Oropus.[471] Further, in giving names\r\nto the three continents, the Greeks did not take into consideration the\r\nwhole habitable earth, but merely their own country and the land exactly\r\nopposite, namely, Caria, which is now inhabited by the Ionians and\r\nother neighbouring tribes. In course of time, as they advanced further\r\nand daily became acquainted with new countries, this their division came\r\nto be general.”\r\n\r\nI take this last part first, and (to use Eratosthenes’ own words, not\r\nthose of Democritus) willing to pick my bone of contention, inquire,\r\nwhether they who first made the division of the three continents were\r\nthe same persons as those who first desired to distinguish their own\r\nland from that of the Carians opposite, or whether they were only\r\nacquainted with Greece, Caria, and some few other adjoining countries,\r\nand not with Europe, Asia, or Africa; but that others who followed them,\r\nand were able to write a description of the habitable earth, were the\r\nreal authors of the division into three continents. How did he know that\r\nthese were not the men who made this division of the habitable earth?\r\nAnd he who divided the earth into three parts, giving to each portion\r\nthe name of “continent,” could he not form in his mind a just idea of\r\nthat taken as a whole, which he had so parcelled out. But if indeed he\r\nwere not acquainted with the whole habitable earth, but merely made a\r\ndivision of some part thereof, pray what portion of that part did he\r\ndenominate Asia, or Europe, or simply continent? Such talk is altogether\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n8. The reasoning of Eratosthenes, however, is still more absurd, when he\r\ndeclares that he sees no advantage in being acquainted with the exact\r\nboundaries of countries, and then cites the example of Colyttus and\r\nMelitè, which prove just the contrary of his assertion. Surely if a want\r\nof certainty respecting the boundaries of Thyrea and Oropus gave rise to\r\nwar, a knowledge of the limits of different districts must be of\r\npractical importance. Will he tell us that the boundaries of districts,\r\nor the limits of kingdoms, may be of some service, but when applied to\r\ncontinents it is carrying the matter too far. We reply, it is of equal\r\nconsequence here. Suppose a dispute between two powerful princes, one\r\nclaiming the possession of Asia and the other of Africa, to which of\r\nthese should Egypt, I mean the country called Lower Egypt, appertain.\r\nWill any one pass over such cases on account of their rarity? By no\r\nmeans. It is acknowledged by every one that the limits of each continent\r\nought to be defined by some notable boundary, indicated by the\r\nconfiguration of the whole habitable earth. In following out this\r\nprinciple, we should not be very particular if they who determine\r\nboundaries by the rivers leave some districts undefined, since the\r\nrivers do not reach from sea to sea, nor leave the continents altogether\r\nas islands.\r\n\r\n9. At the close of the book Eratosthenes blames the system of those who\r\nwould divide all mankind into Greeks and Barbarians, and likewise those\r\nwho recommended Alexander to treat the Greeks as friends, but the\r\nBarbarians as enemies.[472] He suggests, as a better course, to\r\ndistinguish them according to their virtues and their vices, “since\r\namongst the Greeks there are many worthless characters, and many highly\r\ncivilized are to be found amongst the Barbarians; witness the Indians\r\nand Ariani,[473] or still better the Romans and Carthaginians, whose\r\npolitical system is so beautifully perfect. Alexander, considering this,\r\ndisregarded the advice which had been offered him, and patronized\r\nwithout distinction any man he considered to be deserving.” But we would\r\ninquire whether those men who thus divided the human race, abandoning\r\none portion to contempt, and exalting to dignity the other, were not\r\nactuated to this because they found that on one side justice, knowledge,\r\nand the force of reason reigned supreme, but their contraries on the\r\nother. Alexander did not disregard the advice tendered him, but gladly\r\nembraced and followed it, respecting the wisdom of those who gave it;\r\nand so far from taking the opposite course, he closely pursued that\r\nwhich they pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   In the Second Book, having proposed for discussion the [opinions]\r\n   of Eratosthenes, he examines and refutes whatever that writer may\r\n   have incorrectly said, determined, or laid down. He likewise\r\n   brings forward many statements of Hipparchus, which he disproves,\r\n   and finishes with a short exposition or synopsis of the whole\r\n   subject, namely, geographical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the Third Book of his Geography Eratosthenes furnishes us with a\r\nchart of the habitable earth. This he divides into two portions, by a\r\nline running from east to west parallel to the equator. He makes the\r\nPillars of Hercules the boundary of this line to the west, and to the\r\neast the farthest ridges of those mountains which bound India on the\r\nnorth. From the Pillars he draws the line through the Strait of\r\nSicily,[474] and the southern extremities of Peloponnesus and Attica, to\r\nRhodes and the Gulf of Issus.[475] He says, “Through the whole of this\r\ndistance the line mentioned is drawn across the sea[476] and adjacent\r\ncontinents; the whole length of the Mediterranean as far as Cilicia\r\nextending in that direction. Thence it runs nearly in a straight line\r\nalong the whole chain of the Taurus to India. The Taurus continuing in a\r\nstraight line from the Pillars divides Asia through its whole length\r\ninto two halves, north and south. So that both the Taurus and the sea\r\nfrom the Pillars hither[477] lie under the parallel of Athens.”\r\n\r\n2. He then declares that the ancient geographical chart wants revision;\r\nthat in it the eastern portion of the Taurus is made to run too far\r\nnorth, India itself being also too much drawn in the same direction. One\r\nproof which he offers in support of this is, that the most southern\r\nextremities of India are under the same latitude as Meroe, as attested\r\nby many, both from astronomical observations and the temperature of the\r\nclimate. From thence to the most northerly point by the mountains of the\r\nCaucasus,[478] there are 15,000 stadia, according to Patrocles, a writer\r\nwhom we are bound to believe, both on account of his worth, and the vast\r\namount of his geographical attainments. Now since the distance from\r\nMeroe to the parallel of Athens is nearly the same, the most northerly\r\npoints of India next to the Caucasian mountains ought to be under the\r\nsame degree of latitude.\r\n\r\n3. But there is another method (says Eratosthenes) of proving this. The\r\ndistance from the Gulf of Issus to the Euxine, proceeding in a northerly\r\ndirection towards Amisus[479] and Sinope,[480] is about 3000 stadia,\r\nwhich is as much as the supposed extent of the mountains [of the\r\nTaurus].[481] The traveller who directs his course from Amisus due\r\neast,[482] arrives first at Colchis, then at the high lands by the\r\nHyrcanian Sea,[483] afterwards at the road leading to Bactra,[484] and\r\nbeyond to the Scythians; having the mountains always on the right. The\r\nsame line drawn through Amisus westward, crosses the Propontis and\r\nHellespont. From Meroe to the Hellespont there are not more than 18,000\r\nstadia.[485] The distance is just the same from the southern extremity\r\nof India to the land of Bactria, if we add to the 15,000 stadia of that\r\ncountry the 3000 which its mountains occupy in breadth.\r\n\r\n4. Hipparchus tries to invalidate this view of Eratosthenes, by sneering\r\nat the proofs on which it rests. Patrocles, he says, merits little\r\ncredit, being contradicted by the two writers Deimachus and\r\nMegasthenes, who say that the distance[486] taken from the southern\r\nocean, is in some places 20,000, in others 30,000 stadia; that in this\r\nassertion they are supported by the ancient charts, and he considers it\r\nabsurd to require us to put implicit faith in Patrocles alone, when\r\nthere is so much testimony against him; or that the ancient charts\r\nshould be corrected; but rather that they should be left as they are\r\nuntil we have something more certain on the subject.\r\n\r\n5. This argument, I think, is in many instances unfounded. Eratosthenes\r\navailed himself of the statements of many writers, although Hipparchus\r\nalleges he was solely led by Patrocles. Who then are the authors of the\r\nstatement that the southern extremity of India is under the same\r\nparallel as Meroe; and who are they who estimate[487] the distance from\r\nMeroe to the parallel passing through Athens? Or who, again, were those\r\nwho asserted that the whole breadth occupied by the mountains[488] was\r\nequal to the distance from Cilicia to Amisus? Or who made known that,\r\ntravelling from Amisus, the course lay in a straight line due east\r\nthrough Colchis, the [sea of] Hyrcania, so on to Bactria, and beyond\r\nthis to the eastern ocean,[489] the mountains being always on the right\r\nhand; and that this same line carried west in a straight line, traverses\r\nthe Propontis and the Hellespont? These things Eratosthenes advances on\r\nthe testimony of men who had been on the spot, and from the study of\r\nthose numerous memoirs which he had for reference in that noble\r\nlibrary[490] which Hipparchus himself acknowledges to be gigantic.\r\n\r\n6. Besides, the credibility of Patrocles can be proved by a variety of\r\nevidence—the princes[491] who confided to him so important trusts—the\r\nauthors who follow his statements—and those, too, who criticise them,\r\nwhose names Hipparchus has recorded. Since whenever these are refuted,\r\nthe credit of Patrocles is by so much advanced. Nor does Patrocles\r\nappear to state any thing improbable when he says that the army of\r\nAlexander took but a very hasty view of every thing [in India], but\r\nAlexander himself a more exact one, causing the whole country to be\r\ndescribed by men well acquainted with it. Which description he says was\r\nafterwards put into his hands by Xenocles the treasurer.\r\n\r\n7. Again, in the second volume of his Commentaries, Hipparchus accuses\r\nEratosthenes of himself throwing discredit on the statement of\r\nPatrocles, on account of his differing with Megasthenes, as to the\r\nlength of India on its northern side;[492] Megasthenes stating the\r\nlength at 16,000 stadia, and Patrocles at 1000 less. Being biased by a\r\ncertain Itinerary, Eratosthenes was led to reject them both on account\r\nof this discrepancy, and to follow the Itinerary. If then merely the\r\ndifference of 1000 stadia is sufficient to cause the authority of\r\nPatrocles to be rejected, how much more should this be the case when we\r\nfind a difference of 8000 stadia between his statement and that of two\r\nwriters who agree perfectly in theirs, that the breadth of India is\r\n20,000 stadia, while he gives only 12,000!\r\n\r\n8. We reply, that [Eratosthenes] did not object [to the statement of\r\nPatrocles] merely because it differed [from that of Megasthenes], but\r\nbecause the statement of this latter as to the stadia was confirmed by\r\nthe Itinerary, an authority of no mean importance. There is nothing\r\nwonderful in this, that though a certain statement may be credible,\r\nanother may be more credible; and that while in some instances we follow\r\nthe former, in others we may dissent from it on finding a more\r\ntrustworthy guide. It is ridiculous to say that the greater the\r\ndifference of one writer from others, the less he should be trusted. On\r\nthe contrary, such a rule would be more applicable in regard to small\r\ndifferences; for in little particulars the ordinary observer and the man\r\nof great ability are equally liable to err. On the other hand, in great\r\nmatters, the ordinary run of men are more like to be deceived than the\r\nman of superior talent, to whom consequently in such cases greater\r\ndeference is paid.\r\n\r\n9. Generally speaking, the men who hitherto have written on the affairs\r\nof India, were a set of liars. Deimachus holds the first place in the\r\nlist, Megasthenes comes next, while Onesicritus and Nearchus, with\r\nothers of the same class, manage to stammer out a few words [of truth].\r\nOf this we became the more convinced whilst writing the history of\r\nAlexander. No faith whatever can be placed in Deimachus and Megasthenes.\r\nThey coined the fables concerning men with ears large enough to sleep\r\nin, men without any mouths, without noses, with only one eye, with\r\nspider-legs, and with fingers bent backward. They renewed Homer’s fable\r\nconcerning the battles of the Cranes and Pygmies, and asserted the\r\nlatter to be three spans high. They told of ants digging for gold, of\r\nPans with wedge-shaped heads, of serpents swallowing down oxen and\r\nstags, horns and all; meantime, as Eratosthenes has observed,\r\nreciprocally accusing each other of falsehood. Both of these men were\r\nsent ambassadors to Palimbothra,[493]—Megasthenes to Sandrocottus,\r\nDeimachus to Allitrochades his son; and such are the notes of their\r\nresidence abroad, which, I know not why, they thought fit to leave.\r\nPatrocles certainly does not resemble them; nor do any other of the\r\nauthorities consulted by Eratosthenes contain such absurdities.\r\n\r\n10. [494]If the meridian of Rhodes and Byzantium has been rightly\r\ndetermined to be the same, then that of Cilicia and Amisus has likewise\r\nbeen rightly determined; many observations having proved that the lines\r\nare parallel, and that they never impinge on each other.\r\n\r\n11. In like manner, that the voyage from Amisus to Colchis, and the\r\nroute to the Caspian, and thence on to Bactra, are both due east, is\r\nproved by the winds, the seasons, the fruits, and even the sun-risings.\r\nFrequently evidence such as this, and general agreement, are more to be\r\nrelied on than the measurement taken by means of instruments. Hipparchus\r\nhimself was not wholly indebted to instruments and geometrical\r\ncalculations for his statement that the Pillars and Cilicia lie in a\r\ndirect line due east. For that part of it included between the Pillars\r\nand the Strait of Sicily he rests entirely on the assertion of sailors.\r\nIt is therefore incorrect to say that, because we cannot exactly\r\ndetermine the duration of the longest and shortest days, nor the degree\r\nof shadow of the gnomon throughout the mountainous region between\r\nCilicia and India, that therefore we are unable to decide whether the\r\nline traced obliquely on the ancient charts should or should not be\r\nparallel, and consequently must leave it unreformed, keeping it oblique\r\nas the ancient charts have it. For in the first place, not to determine\r\nany thing is to leave it undetermined; and to leave a thing\r\nundetermined, is neither to take one view of the matter nor the other:\r\nbut to agree to leave it as the ancients have, that is to take a view of\r\nthe case. It would have been more consistent with his reasoning, if he\r\nhad told us to leave Geography alone altogether, since we are similarly\r\nunable to determine the position of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the\r\nmountains of Thrace,[495] Illyria,[496] and Germany. Wherefore should we\r\ngive more credit to the ancient writers than to the modern, when we call\r\nto mind the numerous errors of their charts which have been pointed out\r\nby Eratosthenes, and which Hipparchus has not attempted to defend.\r\n\r\n12. But the system of Hipparchus altogether teems with difficulties.\r\nReflect for an instant on the following absurdity; after admitting that\r\nthe southern extremity of India is under the same degree of latitude as\r\nMeroe, and that the distance from Meroe to the Strait of Byzantium is\r\nabout 18,000[497] stadia, he then makes the distance from the southern\r\nextremity of India to the mountains 30,000 stadia. Since Byzantium and\r\nMarseilles are under the same parallel of latitude, as Hipparchus tells\r\nus they are, on the authority of Pytheas, and since Byzantium and the\r\nDnieper[498] have also the same meridian, as Hipparchus equally assures\r\nus, if we take his assertion that there is a distance of 3700[499]\r\nstadia between Byzantium and the Dnieper, there will of course be a like\r\ndifference between the latitude of Marseilles and the Dnieper. This\r\nwould make the latitude of the Dnieper identical with that of Keltica\r\nnext the Ocean; for on proceeding 3700 stadia [north of Marseilles], we\r\nreach the ocean.[500]\r\n\r\n13. Again, we know that the Cinnamon Country is the most southerly point\r\nof the habitable earth. According to Hipparchus’s own statement, the\r\nlatitude of this country, which marks the commencement of the temperate\r\nzone, and likewise of the habitable earth, is distant from the equator\r\nabout 8800 stadia.[501] And since he likewise says that from the equator\r\nto the parallel of the Dnieper there are 34,000 stadia, there will\r\nremain a distance of 25,200 stadia between the parallel of the Dnieper\r\n(which is the same as that which passes over the side of Keltica next\r\nthe Ocean) to that which separates the torrid from the temperate zone.\r\nIt is said that the farthest voyages now made north of Keltica are to\r\nIerne,[502] which lies beyond Britain, and, on account of its extreme\r\ncold, barely sustains life; beyond this it is thought to be\r\nuninhabitable. Now the distance between Keltica and Ierne is estimated\r\nat not more than 5000 stadia; so that on this view they must have\r\nestimated the whole breadth of the habitable earth at 30,000 stadia, or\r\njust above.\r\n\r\n14. Let us then transport ourselves to the land opposite the Cinnamon\r\nCountry, and lying to the east under the same parallel of latitude; we\r\nshall there find the country named Taprobane.[503] This Taprobane is\r\nuniversally believed to be a large island situated in the high seas, and\r\nlying to the south opposite India. Its length in the direction of\r\nEthiopia is above 5000 stadia, as they say. There are brought from\r\nthence to the Indian markets, ivory, tortoise-shells, and other wares in\r\nlarge quantities. Now if this island is broad in proportion to its\r\nlength, we cannot suppose that the whole distance,[504] inclusive of the\r\nspace which separates it from India, is less than 3000 stadia, which is\r\nequal to the distance of the [southern] extremity of the habitable earth\r\nfrom Meroe, since the [southern] extremities of India and Meroe are\r\nunder the same parallel. It is likely there are more than 3000\r\nstadia,[505] but taking this number, if we add thereto the 30,000\r\nstadia, which Deimachus states there are between [the southern extremity\r\nof India] and the country of the Bactrians and Sogdians, we shall find\r\nboth of these nations lie beyond the temperate zone and habitable\r\nearth.[506] Who will venture to affirm such to be the case, hearing, as\r\nthey must, the statement made both by ancients and moderns of the genial\r\nclimate and fertility of northern India, Hyrcania, Aria, Margiana,[507]\r\nand Bactriana also? These countries are all equally close to the\r\nnorthern side of the Taurus, Bactriana being contiguous to that part of\r\nthe chain[508] which forms the boundary of India. A country blessed with\r\nsuch advantages must be very far from uninhabitable. It is said that in\r\nHyrcania each vine produces a metrete[509] of wine, and each fig tree 60\r\nmedimni[510] of fruit. That the grains of wheat which fall from the husk\r\non to the earth spring up the year following; that bee-hives are in the\r\ntrees, and the leaves flow with honey. The same may be met with in the\r\npart of Media called Matiana,[511] and also in Sacasena and Araxena,\r\ncountries of Armenia. In these three it is not so much to be wondered\r\nat, since they lie more to the south than Hyrcania, and surpass the rest\r\nof the country in the beauty of their climate; but in Hyrcania it is\r\nmore remarkable. It is said that in Margiana you may frequently meet\r\nwith a vine whose stock would require two men with outstretched arms to\r\nclasp it, and clusters of grapes two cubits long. Aria is described as\r\nsimilarly fertile, the wine being still richer, and keeping perfectly\r\nfor three generations in unpitched casks. Bactriana, which adjoins Aria,\r\nabounds in the same productions, if we except olives.\r\n\r\n15. That there are cold regions in the high and mountainous parts of\r\nthese countries is not to be wondered at; since in the [more] southern\r\nclimates the mountains, and even the tablelands, are cold. The districts\r\nnext the Euxine, in Cappadocia, are much farther north than those\r\nadjoining the Taurus. Bagadania, a vast plain, situated between the\r\nmountains of Argæus[512] and Taurus, hardly produces any fruit trees,\r\nalthough south of the Euxine Sea by 3000 stadia; while the territory\r\nround Sinope,[513] Amisus,[514] and Phanarœa abounds in olives.\r\n\r\nThe Oxus,[515] which divides Bactriana from Sogdiana, is said to be of\r\nsuch easy navigation that the wares of India are brought up it into the\r\nsea of Hyrcania,[516] and thence successively by various other rivers to\r\nthe districts near the Euxine.[517]\r\n\r\n16. Can one find any fertility to compare with this near to the Dnieper,\r\nor that part of Keltica next the ocean,[518] where the vine either does\r\nnot grow at all, or attains no maturity.[519] However, in the more\r\nsoutherly portions of these districts,[520] close to the sea, and those\r\nnext the Bosphorus,[521] the vine brings its fruit to maturity, although\r\nthe grapes are exceedingly small, and the vines are covered up all the\r\nwinter. And in the parts near the mouth of the Palus Mæotis, the frost\r\nis so strong that a general of Mithridates defeated the barbarians here\r\nin a cavalry engagement during the winter, and on the very same spot in\r\na naval fight in summer, when the ice was thawed. Eratosthenes furnishes\r\nus with the following inscription, which he found in the temple of\r\nÆsculapius at Panticapæeon,[522] on a brazen vase which had been broken\r\nby the frost:—\r\n\r\n“If any one doubts the intensity of our winter’s cold, let him believe\r\nwhen he sees this vase. The priest Stratius placed it here, not because\r\nhe considered it a worthy offering to the god, but as a proof of the\r\nseverity of our winter.”\r\n\r\nSince therefore the provinces we have just enumerated [are so superior\r\nin climate, that they] cannot be compared with the countries surrounding\r\nthe Bosphorus, nor even the regions of Amisus and Sinope, (for every one\r\nwill admit that they are much superior to these latter,) it would be\r\nidle to compare them with the districts near the Borysthenes and the\r\nnorth of Keltica; for we have shown that their temperature is not so low\r\nas Amisus, Sinope, Byzantium, and Marseilles, which are universally\r\nacknowledged to be 3700 stadia south of the Dnieper and Keltica.\r\n\r\n17. If the followers of Deimachus add to the 30,000 stadia the distance\r\nto Taprobane and the boundaries of the torrid zone, which cannot be\r\nreckoned less than 4000 stadia,[523] they will then remove Bactria and\r\nAria from their actual localities and place them 34,000 stadia from the\r\ntorrid zone, a distance equal to that which Hipparchus states to be\r\nbetween the equator and [the mouth of] the Dnieper, and the two\r\ncountries will therefore be removed 8800 stadia north of [the mouth of]\r\nthe Dnieper and Keltica; for there are reckoned to be 8800 stadia from\r\nthe equator to the parallel of latitude which separates the temperate\r\nfrom the torrid zone and which crosses the Cinnamon Country.[524] We\r\nhave proved that the regions not more than 5000 stadia north of Keltica,\r\nas far as Ierne,[525] are scarcely habitable, but their reasoning leads\r\nto the conclusion that there is another circle fitted for the habitation\r\nof man, although 3800 stadia north of Ierne.[526] And that Bactra is\r\nstill farther north than the mouth of the Caspian or Hyrcanian Sea,\r\nwhich is distant about 6000 stadia from the recess of the Caspian and\r\nthe mountains of Armenia and Media, and which appears to be the most\r\nnortherly point of the whole coast as far as India, with a sea navigable\r\nto India all the way, as Patrocles, who had the government of these\r\nregions, affirms. Now Bactriana stretches 1000 stadia farther north.\r\nBeyond this the Scythians occupy a much larger territory, bounded by the\r\nNorthern Ocean: here they dwell, though to be sure theirs is a nomade\r\nlife. But we ask how they could exist here at all, supposing even Bactra\r\nto be beyond the limits of the habitable globe. The distance from the\r\nCaucasus to the Northern Sea through Bactra would be rather more than\r\n4000 stadia.[527] This being added to the number[528] of stadia north of\r\nIerne[529] above-mentioned, will give us the whole amount of\r\nuninhabitable land from Ierne northward 7800 stadia, and even omitting\r\nthe 4000 stadia altogether, those parts of Bactriana next the Caucasus\r\nwill still be 3800 stadia farther north than Ierne, and 8800 farther\r\nnorth than Keltica,[530] and [the mouth] of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\n18. Hipparchus narrates that at the Dnieper and [the north of] Keltica,\r\nduring the whole of the summer nights there is one continued twilight\r\nfrom sunset to sunrise, but at the winter solstice the sun never rises\r\nmore than nine cubits above the horizon.[531] He adds that this\r\nphenomenon is yet more remarkable in regions 6300[532] stadia north of\r\nMarseilles, (these regions he supposes to be peopled by Kelts, but I\r\nbelieve are inhabited by Britons, and 2500 stadia north of Keltica,)\r\nwhere the sun at the winter solstice[533] rises only six cubits above\r\nthe horizon. That at 9100[534] stadia north of Marseilles it only rises\r\nfour cubits, and not so much as three in the countries beyond, and which\r\nI consider much farther north than Ierne.[535] However, Hipparchus, on\r\nthe authority of Pytheas, places them south of Britain, and says that\r\nthe longest day there consists only of 19 hours;[536] while in countries\r\nwhere the sun rises but four cubits above the horizon, and which are\r\nsituated 9100[537] stadia north of Marseilles, the day has 18 hours.\r\nConsequently [according to his hypothesis] the most southerly parts of\r\nBritain must be north of these regions. They must therefore be under the\r\nsame parallel, or almost the same, as the parts of Bactriana next to the\r\nCaucasus, which I have shown are, according to the followers of\r\nDeimachus, 3800 stadia farther north than Ierne.[538] Now if we add this\r\nto the number between Marseilles and Ierne, we shall get 12,500 stadia.\r\nBut who ever made known to us that, in those parts, I mean, in the\r\nvicinity of Bactra, this was the duration of the longest day, or the\r\nheight which the sun attains in the meridian at the winter solstice? All\r\nthese things are patent to the eyes of every man, and require no\r\nmathematical investigation; therefore they certainly would have been\r\nmentioned by numerous writers both amongst the ancients who have left us\r\nhistories of Persia, and by the later writers too, who have carried them\r\ndown to our own time. How, too, would their fertility, which I have\r\ndescribed above, harmonize with such a latitude? The facts here advanced\r\nare sufficient to give an idea of the learned manner in which Hipparchus\r\nattempts to controvert the reasoning of Eratosthenes by mere petitiones\r\nprincipii.\r\n\r\n19. Again, Eratosthenes wished to show the ignorance of Deimachus, and\r\nhis want of information concerning such matters, as proved by his\r\nassertion that India lies between the autumnal equinox[539] and winter\r\ntropic.[540] Also in his blaming Megasthenes, where he says that in the\r\nsouthern parts of India the Greater and Lesser Bear are seen to set, and\r\nthe shadows to fall both ways; assuring us that such is not the case in\r\nIndia.[541] These assertions, says Eratosthenes, arise from the\r\nignorance of Deimachus. For it is nothing else than ignorance to suppose\r\nthat the autumnal equinox is not equally distant from the tropics with\r\nthe vernal; since in both equinoxes the sun rises at the same point, and\r\nperforms a similar revolution. Further, [he continues,] the distance\r\nfrom the terrestrial tropic to the equator, between which, according to\r\nDeimachus himself, India is situated, has been proved by measurement to\r\nbe much less than 20,000 stadia, consequently his own statements prove\r\nthat my assertion is correct, and not his. For supposing India to be\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand stadia [in breadth] it could not be contained\r\nin the given space, but if my estimate be taken it is simple enough. It\r\nis another evidence of his want of information, to say that the two\r\nBears are not seen to set, or the shadows to fall both ways, in any part\r\nof India, since 5000 stadia south of Alexandria[542] both of these\r\nphenomena are observable. Thus reasons Eratosthenes; whom Hipparchus\r\nagain criticises in the same mistaken way. First he substitutes [in the\r\ntext of Deimachus] the summer in place of the winter tropic; then he\r\nsays that the evidence of a man ignorant of astronomy ought not to be\r\nreceived in a mathematical question; as if Eratosthenes in the main had\r\nactually been guided by the authority of Deimachus. Could he not see\r\nthat Eratosthenes had followed the general custom in regard to idle\r\nreasoners, one means of refuting whom is to show that their arguments,\r\nwhatever they may be, go only to confirm our views.\r\n\r\n20. It is by assuming as a fact that the southern extremity of India is\r\nunder the same parallel as Meroe, a thing affirmed and believed by most\r\nwriters, that we shall be best able to show the absurdities of the\r\nsystem of Hipparchus. In the first book of his Commentaries he does not\r\nobject to this hypothesis, but in the second book he no longer admits\r\nit; we must examine his reasons for this. He says, “when two countries\r\nare situated under the same parallel, but separated by a great distance,\r\nyou cannot be certain that they are exactly under the same parallel,\r\nunless the _climata_[543] of both the places are found to be similar.\r\nNow Philo, in his account of a voyage by sea to Ethiopia, has given us\r\nthe _clima_ of Meroe. He says that at that place the sun is vertical\r\nforty-five days before the summer solstice,[544] he also informs us of\r\nthe proportion of shadow thrown by the gnomon both at the equinoxes and\r\nsolstices. Eratosthenes agrees almost exactly with Philo. But not a\r\nsingle writer, not even Eratosthenes, has informed us of the _clima_ of\r\nIndia; but if it is the case, as many are inclined to believe on the\r\nauthority of Nearchus,[545] that the two Bears are seen to set in that\r\ncountry, then certainly Meroe and the southern extremity of India cannot\r\nbe under the same parallel.”[546] [Such is the reasoning of Hipparchus,\r\nbut we reply,] If Eratosthenes confirms the statement of those authors\r\nwho tell us that in India the two Bears are observed to set, how can it\r\nbe said that not a single person, not even Eratosthenes, has informed us\r\nof any thing concerning the _clima_ of India? This is itself information\r\non that point. If, however, he has not confirmed this statement, let him\r\nbe exonerated from the error. Certain it is he never did confirm the\r\nstatement. Only when Deimachus affirmed that there was no place in India\r\nfrom which the two Bears might be seen to set, or the shadows fall both\r\nways, as Megasthenes had asserted, Eratosthenes thereupon taxed him with\r\nignorance, regarding as absolutely false this two-fold assertion, one\r\nhalf of which, namely, that concerning the shadows not falling both\r\nways, Hipparchus himself acknowledged to be false; for if the southern\r\nextremity of India were not under the same parallel as Meroe, still\r\nHipparchus appears to have considered it south of Syene.\r\n\r\n21. In the instances which follow, Hipparchus, treating of these\r\nsubjects, either asserts things similar to those which we have already\r\nrefuted, or takes for granted matters which are not so, or draws\r\nimproper sequences. For instance, from the computation [of Eratosthenes]\r\nthat the distance from Babylon to Thapsacus[547] is 4800 stadia, and\r\nthence northward to the mountains of Armenia[548] 2100 stadia more, it\r\ndoes not follow that, starting from the meridian of that city, the\r\ndistance to the northern mountains is above 6000 stadia. Besides,\r\nEratosthenes never says that the distance from Thapsacus to these\r\nmountains is 2100 stadia, but that a part thereof has never yet been\r\nmeasured; so that this argument [of Hipparchus], founded on a false\r\nhypothesis, amounts to nothing. Nor did Eratosthenes ever assert that\r\nThapsacus lies more than 4500 stadia north of Babylon.\r\n\r\n22. Again, Hipparchus, ever anxious to defend the [accuracy of the]\r\nancient charts, instead of fairly stating the words of Eratosthenes\r\nconcerning his third section of the habitable earth, wilfully makes him\r\nthe author of an assertion easy of disproof. For Eratosthenes, following\r\nthe opinion we before mentioned, that a line drawn from the Pillars of\r\nHercules across the Mediterranean, and the length of the Taurus, would\r\nrun due west and east,[549] divides, by means of this line, the\r\nhabitable earth into two portions, which he calls the northern and\r\nsouthern divisions; each of these he again essays to subdivide into as\r\nmany smaller partitions as practicable, which he denominates\r\nsections.[550] He makes India the first section of the southern part,\r\nand Ariana[551] the second; these two countries possessing a good\r\noutline, he has been able not only to give us an accurate statement of\r\ntheir length and breadth, but an almost geometrically exact description\r\nof their figure. He tells us that the form of India is rhomboidal, being\r\nwashed on two of its sides by the southern and eastern oceans\r\n[respectively], which do not deeply indent its shores. The two remaining\r\nsides are contained by its mountains and the river [Indus], so that it\r\npresents a kind of rectilinear figure.[552] As to Ariana, he considered\r\nthree of its sides well fitted to form a parallelogram; but of the\r\nwestern side he could give no regular definition, as it was inhabited by\r\nvarious nations; nevertheless he attempts an idea of it by a line drawn\r\nfrom the Caspian Gates[553] to the limits of Carmania, which border on\r\nthe Persian Gulf. This side he calls western, and that next the Indus\r\neastern, but he does not tell us they are parallel to each other;\r\nneither does he say this of the other sides, one bounded by the\r\nmountains, and the other by the sea; he simply calls them north and\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n23. Having in this manner but imperfectly traced the outlines of his\r\nsecond section, the third section, for various reasons, is still less\r\nexact. The first cause has been already explained, viz. that the line\r\nfrom the Caspian Gates to Carmania is not clearly defined, as the side\r\nof the section is common both to the third and second sections.\r\nSecondly, on account of the Persian Gulf interrupting the continuity of\r\nthe southern side, as he himself tells us, he has been obliged to take\r\nthe measured road running through Susa and Persepolis to the boundaries\r\nof Carmania and Persia, and suppose it straight.[554] This road, which\r\nhe calls the southern side, is a little more than 9000 stadia. He does\r\nnot, however, tell us, that it runs parallel to the northern side. It is\r\nalso clear that the Euphrates, which he makes the western boundary, is\r\nany thing but a straight line. On leaving the mountains it flows south,\r\nbut soon shifts its course to the east; it then again pursues a\r\nsoutherly direction till it reaches the sea. In fact, Eratosthenes\r\nhimself acknowledges the indirect course of this river, when he compares\r\nthe shape of Mesopotamia, which is formed by the junction of the Tigris\r\nand Euphrates, to the cushion on a rower’s bench. The western side\r\nbounded by the Euphrates is not entirely measured; for he tells us that\r\nhe does not know the extent of the portion between Armenia and the\r\nnorthern mountains,[555] as it has not been measured. By reason of these\r\nhinderances he states that he has been only able to give a very\r\nsuperficial view of the third section, and that his estimate of the\r\ndistances is borrowed from various Itineraries, some of them, according\r\nto his own description, anonymous. Hipparchus therefore must be\r\nconsidered guilty of unfairness, for criticising with geometrical\r\nprecision a work of this general nature. We ought rather to be grateful\r\nto a person who gives us any description at all of the character of such\r\n[unknown] places. But when he urges his geometrical objections not\r\nagainst any real statement of Eratosthenes, but merely against imaginary\r\nhypotheses of his own creation, he shows too plainly the contradictory\r\nbent of his mind.\r\n\r\n24. It is in this general kind of description of the third section that\r\nEratosthenes supposes 10,000 stadia from the Caspian Gates to the\r\nEuphrates. This he again divides according to former admeasurements\r\nwhich he found preserved. Starting from the point where the Euphrates\r\npasses near to Thapsacus, he computes from thence to the place where\r\nAlexander crossed the Tigris 2400 stadia. The route thence through\r\nGaugamela,[556] the Lycus,[557] Arbela,[558] and Ecbatana,[559] whither\r\nDarius fled from Gaugamela to the Caspian Gates, makes up the 10,000\r\nstadia, which is only 300 stadia too much. Such is the measure of the\r\nnorthern side given by Eratosthenes, which he could not have supposed to\r\nbe parallel to the mountains, nor yet to the line drawn from the Pillars\r\nof Hercules through Athens and Rhodes. For Thapsacus is far removed from\r\nthe mountains, and the route from Thapsacus to the Caspian Gates only\r\nfalls in with the mountains at that point.[560] Such is the boundary on\r\nthe northern side.\r\n\r\n25. Thus, says Eratosthenes, we have given you a description of the\r\nnorthern side; as for the southern, we cannot take its measure along the\r\nsea, on account of the Persian Gulf, which intercepts [its continuity],\r\nbut from Babylon through Susa and Persepolis to the confines of Persia\r\nand Carmania there are 9200 stadia. This he calls the southern side, but\r\nhe does not say it is parallel to the northern. The difference of length\r\nbetween the northern and southern sides is caused, he tells us, by the\r\nEuphrates, which after running south some distance shifts its course\r\nalmost due east.\r\n\r\n26. Of the two remaining sides, he describes the western first, but\r\nwhether we are to regard it as one single straight line, or two, seems\r\nto be undecided. He says,—From Thapsacus to Babylon, following the\r\ncourse of the Euphrates, there are 4800 stadia; from thence to the mouth\r\nof the Euphrates[561] and the city of Teredon, 3000[562] more; from\r\nThapsacus northward to the Gates of Armenia, having been measured, is\r\nstated to be 1100 stadia, but the distance through Gordyæa and Armenia,\r\nnot having yet been measured, is not given. The eastern side, which\r\nstretches lengthwise through Persia from the Red Sea towards Media and\r\nthe north, does not appear to be less than 8000 stadia, and measured\r\nfrom certain headlands above 9000, the rest of the distance through\r\nParætacena and Media to the Caspian Gates being 3000 stadia. The rivers\r\nTigris and Euphrates flowing from Armenia towards the south, after\r\nhaving passed the Gordyæan mountains, and having formed a great circle\r\nwhich embraces the vast country of Mesopotamia, turn towards the rising\r\nof the sun in winter and the south, particularly the Euphrates, which,\r\ncontinually approaching nearer and nearer to the Tigris, passes by the\r\nrampart of Semiramis,[563] and at about 200 stadia from the village of\r\nOpis,[564] thence it flows through Babylon, and so discharges itself\r\ninto the Persian Gulf. Thus the figure of Mesopotamia and Babylon\r\nresembles the cushion of a rower’s bench.—Such are the words of\r\nEratosthenes.\r\n\r\n27. In the Third Section it is true he does make some mistakes, which we\r\nshall take into consideration; but they are nothing like the amount\r\nwhich Hipparchus attributes to him. However, we will examine his\r\nobjections. [In the first place,] he would have the ancient charts left\r\njust as they are, and by no means India brought more to the south, as\r\nEratosthenes thinks proper. Indeed, he asserts that the very arguments\r\nadduced by that writer only confirm him the more in his opinion. He\r\nsays, “According to Eratosthenes, the northern side of the third section\r\nis bounded by a line of 10,000 stadia drawn from the Caspian Gates to\r\nthe Euphrates, the southern side from Babylon to the confines of\r\nCarmania is a little more than 9000 stadia. On the western side,\r\nfollowing the course of the Euphrates, from Thapsacus to Babylon there\r\nare 4800 stadia, and thence to the outlets of the river 3000 stadia\r\nmore. Northward from Thapsacus [to the Gates of Armenia] is reckoned\r\n1100 stadia; the rest has not been measured. Now since Eratosthenes says\r\nthat the northern side of this Third Section is about 10,000 stadia, and\r\nthat the right line parallel thereto drawn from Babylon to the eastern\r\nside is computed at just above 9000 stadia, it follows that Babylon is\r\nnot much more than 1000 stadia east of the passage of [the Euphrates]\r\nnear Thapsacus.”\r\n\r\n28. We answer, that if the Caspian Gates and the boundary line of\r\nCarmania and Persia were exactly under the same meridian, and if right\r\nlines drawn in the direction of Thapsacus and Babylon would intersect\r\nsuch meridian at right angles, the inference would be just.[565] For\r\nthen the line [from the common frontier of Carmania and Persia] to\r\nBabylon, if produced to the meridian of Thapsacus, would appear to the\r\neye equal, or nearly equal, to that from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus.\r\nConsequently, Babylon would only be east of Thapsacus in the same\r\nproportion as the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus exceeds\r\nthe line drawn from the frontier of Carmania to Babylon.[566]\r\nEratosthenes, however, does not tell us that the line which bounds the\r\nwestern coast of Ariana follows the direction of the meridian; nor yet\r\nthat a line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus would form right\r\nangles with the meridian of the Caspian Gates. But rather, that the line\r\nwhich would form right angles with the meridian, would be one which\r\nshould follow the course of the Taurus, and with which the line drawn\r\nfrom the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus would form an acute angle. Nor,\r\nagain, does he ever say that a line drawn from Carmania to Babylon would\r\nbe parallel to that drawn [from the Caspian Gates] to Thapsacus; and\r\neven if it were parallel, this would prove nothing for the argument of\r\nHipparchus, since it does not form right angles with the meridian of the\r\nCaspian Gates.\r\n\r\n29. But taking this for granted, and proving, as he imagines, that,\r\naccording to Eratosthenes, Babylon is east of Thapsacus rather more than\r\n1000 stadia, he draws from this false hypothesis a new argument, which\r\nhe uses to the following purpose; and says, If we suppose a right line\r\ndrawn from Thapsacus towards the south, and another from Babylon\r\nperpendicular thereto, a right-angled triangle would be the result;\r\nwhose sides should be, 1. A line drawn from Thapsacus to Babylon; 2. A\r\nperpendicular drawn from Babylon to the meridian of Thapsacus; 3. The\r\nmeridian line of Thapsacus. The hypotenuse of this triangle would be a\r\nright line drawn from Thapsacus to Babylon, which he estimates at 4800\r\nstadia. The perpendicular drawn from Babylon to the meridian of\r\nThapsacus is scarcely more than 1000 stadia, the same amount by which\r\nthe line drawn [from the Caspian Gates] to Thapsacus exceeds that [from\r\nthe common frontier of Carmania and Persia] to Babylon. The two sides\r\n[of the triangle] being given, Hipparchus proceeds to find the third,\r\nwhich is much greater than the perpendicular[567] aforesaid. To this he\r\nadds the line drawn from Thapsacus northwards to the mountains of\r\nArmenia, one part of which, according to Eratosthenes, was measured, and\r\nfound to be 1100 stadia; the other, or part unmeasured by Eratosthenes,\r\nHipparchus estimates to be 1000 stadia at the least: so that the two\r\ntogether amount to 2100 stadia. Adding this to the [length of the] side\r\nupon which falls the perpendicular drawn from Babylon, Hipparchus\r\nestimated a distance of many thousand stadia from the mountains of\r\nArmenia and the parallel of Athens to this perpendicular, which falls on\r\nthe parallel of Babylon.[568] From the parallel of Athens[569] to that\r\nof Babylon he shows that there cannot be a greater distance than 2400\r\nstadia, even admitting the estimate supplied by Eratosthenes himself of\r\nthe number of stadia which the entire meridian contains;[570] and that\r\nif this be so, the mountains of Armenia and the Taurus cannot be under\r\nthe same parallel of latitude as Athens, (which is the opinion of\r\nEratosthenes,) but many thousand stadia to the north, as the data\r\nsupplied by that writer himself prove.\r\n\r\nBut here, for the formation of his right-angled triangle, Hipparchus not\r\nonly makes use of propositions already overturned, but assumes what was\r\nnever granted, namely, that the hypotenuse subtending his right angle,\r\nwhich is the straight line from Thapsacus to Babylon, is 4800 stadia in\r\nlength. What Eratosthenes says is, that this route follows the course of\r\nthe Euphrates, and adds, that Mesopotamia and Babylon are encompassed as\r\nit were by a great circle formed by the Euphrates and Tigris, but\r\nprincipally by the former of these rivers. So that a straight line from\r\nThapsacus to Babylon would neither follow the course of the Euphrates,\r\nnor yet be near so many stadia in length. Thus the argument [of\r\nHipparchus] is overturned. We have stated before, that supposing two\r\nlines drawn from the Caspian Gates, one to Thapsacus, and the other to\r\nthe mountains of Armenia opposite Thapsacus, and distant therefrom,\r\naccording to Hipparchus’s own estimate, 2100 stadia at the very least,\r\nneither of them would be parallel to each other, nor yet to that line\r\nwhich, passing through Babylon, is styled by Eratosthenes the southern\r\nside [of the third section]. As he could not inform us of the exact\r\nlength of the route by the mountains, Eratosthenes tells us the distance\r\nbetween Thapsacus and the Caspian Gates; in fact, to speak in a general\r\nway, he puts this distance in place of the other; besides, as he merely\r\nwanted to give the length of the territory between Ariana and the\r\nEuphrates, he was not particular to have the exact measure of either\r\nroute. To pretend that he considered the lines to be parallel to each\r\nother, is evidently to accuse the man of more than childish ignorance,\r\nand we dismiss the insinuation as nonsense forthwith.\r\n\r\n30. There, however, are some instances in which one may justly accuse\r\nEratosthenes. There is a difference in dissecting _limb by limb_, or\r\nmerely cutting off _portions_ [indiscriminately], (for in the former you\r\nmay only separate parts having a natural outline, and distinguished by a\r\nregular form; this the poet alludes to in the expression,\r\n\r\n   “Cutting them limb from limb;”[571]\r\n\r\nwhereas in regard to the latter this is not the case,) and we may adopt\r\nwith propriety either one or other of these plans according to the time\r\nand necessity. So in Geography, if you enter into every detail, you may\r\nsometimes be compelled to divide your territories into _portions_, so to\r\nspeak, but it is a more preferable way to separate them into limbs, than\r\ninto such chance pieces; for thus only you can define accurately\r\nparticular _points and boundaries_, a thing so necessary to the\r\ngeographer. When it can be done, the best way to define a country is by\r\nthe rivers, mountains, or sea; also, where possible, by the nation or\r\nnations [who inhabit it], and by its size and configuration. However, in\r\ndefault of a geometrical definition, a simple and general description\r\nmay be said always to answer the purpose. In regard to size, it is\r\nsufficient to state the greatest length and breadth; for example, that\r\nthe habitable earth is 70,000 stadia long, and that its breadth is\r\nscarcely half its length.[572] And as to form, to compare a country to\r\nany geometrical or other well-known figure. For example, Sicily to a\r\ntriangle, Spain to an ox-hide, or the Peloponnesus to a plane-leaf.[573]\r\nThe larger the territory to be divided, the more general also ought its\r\ndivisions to be.\r\n\r\n31. [In the system of Eratosthenes], the habitable earth has been\r\nadmirably divided into two parts by the Taurus and the Mediterranean\r\nSea, which reaches to the Pillars. On the southern side, the limits of\r\nIndia have been described by a variety of methods; by its\r\nmountains,[574] its river,[575] its seas,[576] and its name,[577] which\r\nseems to indicate that it is inhabited only by one people.[578] It is\r\nwith justice too that he attributes to it the form of a quadrilateral or\r\nrhomboid. Ariana is not so accurately described, on account of its\r\nwestern side being interwoven with the adjacent land. Still it is pretty\r\nwell distinguished by its three other sides, which are formed by three\r\nnearly straight lines, and also by its name, which shows it to be only\r\none nation.[579] As to the Third Section of Eratosthenes, it cannot be\r\nconsidered to be defined or circumscribed at all; for that side of it\r\nwhich is common to Ariana is but ill defined, as before remarked. The\r\nsouthern side, too, is most negligently taken: it is, in fact, no\r\nboundary to the section at all, for it passes right through its centre,\r\nleaving entirely outside of it many of the southern portions. Nor yet\r\ndoes it represent the greatest length of the section, for the northern\r\nside is the longest.[580] Nor, lastly, can the Euphrates be its western\r\nboundary, not even if it flowed in a right line, since its two\r\nextremes[581] do not lie under the same meridian. How then is it the\r\nwestern rather than the southern boundary? Apart from this, the distance\r\nto the Seas of Cilicia and Syria is so inconsiderable, that there can be\r\nno reason why he should not have enlarged the third section, so as to\r\ninclude the kingdoms of Semiramis and Ninus, who are both of them known\r\nas Syrian monarchs; the first built Babylon, which he made his royal\r\nresidence; the second Ninus,[582] the capital of Syria;[583] and the\r\nsame dialect still exists on both sides of the Euphrates. The idea of\r\nthus dismembering so renowned a nation, and allotting its portions to\r\nstrange nations with which it had no connexion, is as peculiarly\r\nunfortunate. Eratosthenes cannot plead that he was compelled to do this\r\non account of its size, for had it extended as far as the sea and the\r\nfrontiers of Arabia Felix and Egypt, even then it would not have been as\r\nlarge as India, or even Ariana. It would have therefore been much better\r\nto have enlarged the third section, making it comprehend the whole space\r\nas far as the Sea of Syria; but if this were done, the southern side\r\nwould not be as he represents it, nor yet in a straight line, but\r\nstarting from Carmania would follow the right side of the sea-shore from\r\nthe Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Euphrates; it would then approach\r\nthe limits of Mesene[584] and Babylon, where the Isthmus commences which\r\nseparates Arabia Felix from the rest of the continent. Traversing the\r\nIsthmus, it would continue its course to the recess of the Arabian Gulf\r\nand Pelusium,[585] thence to the mouth of the Nile at Canopus.[586] Such\r\nwould be the southern side. The west would be traced by the sea-shore\r\nfrom the [river’s] mouth at Canopus to Cilicia.[587]\r\n\r\n32. The fourth section would consist of Arabia Felix, the Arabian Gulf,\r\nand the whole of Egypt and Ethiopia. Its length bounded by two\r\nmeridians, one drawn through its most western point, the other through\r\nits most eastern; and its breadth by two parallels through its most\r\nnorthern and southern points. For this is the best way to describe the\r\nextent of irregular figures, whose length and breadth cannot be\r\ndetermined by their sides.\r\n\r\nIn general it is to be observed, that length and breadth are to be\r\nunderstood in different ways, according as you speak of the whole or a\r\npart. Of a whole, the greater distance is called its length, and the\r\nlesser its breadth; of a part, that is to be considered the length which\r\nis parallel to the length of the whole, without any regard whether it,\r\nor that which is left for the breadth, be the greater distance. The\r\nlength of the whole habitable earth is measured from east to west by a\r\nline drawn parallel to the equator, and its breadth from north to south\r\nin the direction of the meridian; consequently, the length of any of the\r\nparts ought to be portions of a line drawn parallel to the length of the\r\nwhole, and their breadth to the breadth of the whole. For, in the first\r\nplace, by this means the size of the whole habitable earth will be best\r\ndescribed; and secondly, the disposition and configuration of its parts,\r\nand the manner in which one may be said to be greater or less than\r\nanother, will be made manifest by thus comparing them.\r\n\r\n33. Eratosthenes, however, measures the length of the habitable earth by\r\na line which he considers straight, drawn from the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nin the direction of the Caspian Gates and the Caucasus. The length of\r\nthe third section, by a line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus,\r\nand of the fourth, by one running from Thapsacus through Heroopolis to\r\nthe country surrounded by the Nile: this must necessarily be deflected\r\nto Canopus and Alexandria, for there is the last mouth of the Nile,\r\nwhich goes by the name of the Canopic[588] or Heracleotic mouth. Whether\r\ntherefore these two lengths be considered to form one straight line, or\r\nto make an angle with Thapsacus, certain it is that neither of them is\r\nparallel to the length of the habitable earth; this is evident from what\r\nEratosthenes has himself said concerning them. According to him the\r\nlength of the habitable earth is described by a right line running\r\nthrough the Taurus to the Pillars of Hercules, in the direction of the\r\nCaucasus, Rhodes, and Athens. From Rhodes to Alexandria, following the\r\nmeridian of the two cities, he says there cannot be much less than 4000\r\nstadia,[589] consequently there must be the same difference between the\r\nlatitudes of Rhodes and Alexandria. Now the latitude of Heroopolis is\r\nabout the same as Alexandria, or rather more south. So that a line,\r\nwhether straight or broken, which intersects the parallel of Heroopolis,\r\nRhodes, or the Gates of the Caspian, cannot be parallel to either of\r\nthese. These lengths therefore are not properly indicated, nor are the\r\nnorthern sections any better.\r\n\r\n34. We will now return at once to Hipparchus, and see what comes next.\r\nContinuing to palm assumptions of his own [upon Eratosthenes], he goes\r\non to refute, with geometrical accuracy, statements which that author\r\nhad made in a mere general way. “Eratosthenes,” he says, “estimates that\r\nthere are 6700 stadia between Babylon and the Caspian Gates, and from\r\nBabylon to the frontiers of Carmania and Persia above 9000 stadia; this\r\nhe supposes to lie in a direct line towards the equinoctial rising,[590]\r\nand perpendicular to the common side of his second and third sections.\r\nThus, according to his plan, we should have a right-angled triangle,\r\nwith the right angle next to the frontiers of Carmania, and its\r\nhypotenuse less than one of the sides about the right angle!\r\nConsequently Persia should be included in the second section.”[591]\r\n\r\nTo this we reply, that the line drawn from Babylon to Carmania was\r\nnever intended as a parallel, nor yet that which divides the two\r\nsections as a meridian, and that therefore nothing has been laid to his\r\ncharge, at all events with any just foundation. In fact, Eratosthenes\r\nhaving stated the number of stadia from the Caspian Gates to Babylon as\r\nabove given,[592] [from the Caspian Gates] to Susa 4900 stadia, and from\r\nBabylon [to Susa] 3400 stadia, Hipparchus runs away from his former\r\nhypothesis, and says that [by drawing lines from] the Caspian Gates,\r\nSusa, and Babylon, an obtuse-angled triangle would be the result, whose\r\nsides should be of the length laid down, and of which Susa would form\r\nthe obtuse angle. He then argues, that “according to these premises, the\r\nmeridian drawn from the Gates of the Caspian will intersect the parallel\r\nof Babylon and Susa 4400 stadia more to the west, than would a straight\r\nline drawn from the Caspian to the confines of Carmania and Persia; and\r\nthat this last line, forming with the meridian of the Caspian Gates half\r\na right angle, would lie exactly in a direction midway between the south\r\nand the equinoctial rising. Now as the course of the Indus is parallel\r\nto this line, it cannot flow south on its descent from the mountains, as\r\nEratosthenes asserts, but in a direction lying between the south and the\r\nequinoctial rising, as laid down in the ancient charts.” But who is\r\nthere who will admit this to be an obtuse-angled triangle, without also\r\nadmitting that it contains a right angle? Who will agree that the line\r\nfrom Babylon to Susa, which forms one side of this obtuse-angled\r\ntriangle, lies parallel, without admitting the same of the whole line as\r\nfar as Carmania? or that the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to the\r\nfrontiers of Carmania is parallel to the Indus? Nevertheless, without\r\nthis the reasoning [of Hipparchus] is worth nothing.\r\n\r\n“Eratosthenes himself also states,” [continues Hipparchus,[593]] “that\r\nthe form of India is rhomboidal; and since the whole eastern border of\r\nthat country has a decided tendency towards the east, but more\r\nparticularly the extremest cape,[594] which lies more to the south than\r\nany other part of the coast, the side next the Indus must be the same.”\r\n\r\n35. These arguments may be very geometrical, but they are not\r\nconvincing. After having himself invented these various difficulties, he\r\ndismisses them, saying, “Had [Eratosthenes] been chargeable for small\r\ndistances only, he might have been excused; but since his mistakes\r\ninvolve thousands of stadia, we cannot pardon him, more especially since\r\nhe has laid it down that at a mere distance of 400 stadia,[595] such as\r\nthat between the parallels of Athens and Rhodes, there is a sensible\r\nvariation [of latitude].” But these sensible variations are not all of\r\nthe same kind, the distance [involved therein] being in some instances\r\ngreater, in others less; greater, when for our estimate of the climata\r\nwe trust merely to the eye, or are guided by the vegetable productions\r\nand the temperature of the air; less, when we employ gnomons and\r\ndioptric instruments. Nothing is more likely than that if you measure\r\nthe parallel of Athens, or that of Rhodes and Caria, by means of a\r\ngnomon, the difference resulting from so many stadia[596] will be\r\nsensible. But when a geographer, in order to trace a line from west to\r\neast, 3000 stadia broad, makes use of a chain of mountains 40,000 stadia\r\nlong, and also of a sea which extends still farther 30,000 stadia, and\r\nfarther wishing to point out the situation of the different parts of the\r\nhabitable earth relative to this line, calls some southern, others\r\nnorthern, and finally lays out what he calls the sections, each section\r\nconsisting of divers countries, then we ought carefully to examine in\r\nwhat acceptation he uses his terms; in what sense he says that such a\r\nside [of any section] is the north side, and what other is the south, or\r\neast, or west side. If he does not take pains to avoid great errors, he\r\ndeserves to be blamed, but should he be guilty merely of trifling\r\ninaccuracies, he should be forgiven. But here nothing shows thoroughly\r\nthat Eratosthenes has committed either serious or slight errors, for on\r\none hand what he may have said concerning such great distances, can\r\nnever be verified by a geometrical test, and on the other, his accuser,\r\nwhile endeavouring to reason like a geometrician, does not found his\r\narguments on any real data, but on gratuitous suppositions.\r\n\r\n36. The fourth section Hipparchus certainly manages better, though he\r\nstill maintains the same censorious tone, and obstinacy in sticking to\r\nhis first hypotheses, or others similar. He properly objects to\r\nEratosthenes giving as the length of this section a line drawn from\r\nThapsacus to Egypt, as being similar to the case of a man who should\r\ntell us that the diagonal of a parallelogram was its length. For\r\nThapsacus and the coasts of Egypt are by no means under the same\r\nparallel of latitude, but under parallels considerably distant from each\r\nother,[597] and a line drawn from Thapsacus to Egypt would lie in a kind\r\nof diagonal or oblique direction between them. But he is wrong when he\r\nexpresses his surprise that Eratosthenes should dare to state the\r\ndistance between Pelusium and Thapsacus at 6000 stadia, when he says\r\nthere are above 8000. In proof of this he advances that the parallel of\r\nPelusium is south of that of Babylon by more than 2500 stadia, and that\r\naccording to Eratosthenes (as he supposes) the latitude of Thapsacus is\r\nabove 4800 stadia north of that of Babylon; from which Hipparchus tells\r\nus it results that [between Thapsacus and Pelusium] there are more than\r\n8000 stadia. But I would inquire how he can prove that Eratosthenes\r\nsupposed so great a distance between the parallels of Babylon and\r\nThapsacus? He says, indeed, that such is the distance from Thapsacus to\r\nBabylon, but not that there is this distance between their parallels,\r\nnor yet that Thapsacus and Babylon are under the same meridian. So much\r\nthe contrary, that Hipparchus has himself pointed out, that, according\r\nto Eratosthenes, Babylon ought to be east of Thapsacus more than 2000\r\nstadia. We have before cited the statement of Eratosthenes, that\r\nMesopotamia and Babylon are encircled by the Tigris and Euphrates, and\r\nthat the greater portion of the Circle is formed by this latter river,\r\nwhich flowing north and south takes a turn to the east, and then,\r\nreturning to a southerly direction, discharges itself [into the sea].\r\nSo long as it flows from north to south, it may be said to follow a\r\nsoutherly direction; but the turning towards the east and Babylon is a\r\ndecided deviation from the southerly direction, and it never recovers a\r\nstraight course, but forms the circuit we have mentioned above. When he\r\ntells us that the journey from Babylon to Thapsacus is 4800 stadia, he\r\nadds, following the course of the Euphrates, as if on purpose lest any\r\none should understand such to be the distance in a direct line, or\r\nbetween the two parallels. If this be not granted, it is altogether a\r\nvain attempt to show that if a right-angled triangle were constructed by\r\nlines drawn from Pelusium and Thapsacus to the point where the parallel\r\nof Thapsacus intercepts the meridian of Pelusium, that one of the lines\r\nwhich form the right angle, and is in the direction of the meridian,\r\nwould be longer than that forming the hypotenuse drawn from Thapsacus to\r\nPelusium.[598] Worthless, too, is the argument in connexion with this,\r\nbeing the inference from a proposition not admitted; for Eratosthenes\r\nnever asserts that from Babylon to the meridian of the Caspian Gates is\r\na distance of 4800 stadia. We have shown that Hipparchus deduces this\r\nfrom data not admitted by Eratosthenes; but desirous to controvert every\r\nthing advanced by that writer, he assumes that from Babylon to the line\r\ndrawn from the Caspian Gates to the mountains of Carmania, according to\r\nEratosthenes’ description, there are above 9000 stadia, and from thence\r\ndraws his conclusions.\r\n\r\n37. Eratosthenes[599] cannot, therefore, be found fault with on these\r\ngrounds; what may be objected against him is as follows. When you wish\r\nto give a general outline of size and configuration, you should devise\r\nfor yourself some rule which may be adhered to more or less. After\r\nhaving laid down that the breadth of the space occupied by the mountains\r\nwhich run in a direction due east, as well as by the sea which reaches\r\nto the Pillars of Hercules, is 3000 stadia, would you pretend to\r\nestimate different lines, which you may draw within the breadth of that\r\nspace, as one and the same line? We should be more willing to grant you\r\nthe power of doing so with respect to the lines which run parallel to\r\nthat space than with those which fall upon it; and among these latter,\r\nrather with respect to those which fall within it than to those which\r\nextend without it; and also rather for those which, in regard to the\r\nshortness of their extent, would not pass out of the said space than for\r\nthose which would. And again, rather for lines of some considerable\r\nlength than for any thing very short, for the inequality of lengths is\r\nless perceptible in great extents than the difference of configuration.\r\nFor example, if you give 3000 stadia for the breadth at the Taurus, as\r\nwell as for the sea which extends to the Pillars of Hercules, you will\r\nform a parallelogram entirely enclosing both the mountains of the Taurus\r\nand the sea; if you divide it in its length into several other\r\nparallelograms, and draw first the diagonal of the great parallelogram,\r\nand next that of each smaller parallelogram, surely the diagonal of the\r\ngreat parallelogram will be regarded as a line more nearly parallel and\r\nequal to the side forming the length of that figure than the diagonal of\r\nany of the smaller parallelograms: and the more your lesser\r\nparallelograms should be multiplied, the more will this become evident.\r\nCertainly, it is in great figures that the obliquity of the diagonal and\r\nits difference from the side forming the length are the less\r\nperceptible, so that you would have but little scruple in taking the\r\ndiagonal as the length of the figure. But if you draw the diagonal more\r\ninclined, so that it falls beyond both sides, or at least beyond one of\r\nthe sides, then will this no longer be the case; and this is the sense\r\nin which we have observed, that when you attempted to draw even in a\r\nvery general way the extents of the figures, you ought to adopt some\r\nrule. But Eratosthenes takes a line from the Caspian Gates along the\r\nmountains, running as it were in the same parallel as far as the\r\nPillars, and then a second line, starting directly from the mountains to\r\ntouch Thapsacus; and again a third line from Thapsacus to the frontiers\r\nof Egypt, occupying so great a breadth. If then in proceeding you give\r\nthe length of the two last lines [taken together] as the measure of the\r\nlength of the district, you will appear to measure the length of one of\r\nyour parallelograms by its diagonal. And if, farther, this diagonal\r\nshould consist of a broken line, as that would be which stretches from\r\nthe Caspian Gates to the embouchure of the Nile, passing by Thapsacus,\r\nyour error will appear much greater. This is the sum of what may be\r\nalleged against Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n38. In another respect also we have to complain of Hipparchus, because,\r\nas he had given a category of the statements of Eratosthenes, he ought\r\nto have corrected his mistakes, in the same way that we have done; but\r\nwhenever he has any thing particular to remark, he tells us to follow\r\nthe ancient charts, which, to say the least, need correction infinitely\r\nmore than the map of Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\nThe argument which follows is equally objectionable, being founded on\r\nthe consequences of a proposition which, as we have shown, is\r\ninadmissible, namely, that Babylon was not more than 1000 stadia east of\r\nThapsacus; when it was quite clear, from Eratosthenes’ own words, that\r\nBabylon was above 2400 stadia east of that place; since from Thapsacus\r\nto the passage of the Euphrates where it was crossed by Alexander, the\r\nshortest route is 2400 stadia, and the Tigris and Euphrates, having\r\nencompassed Mesopotamia, flow towards the east, and afterwards take a\r\nsoutherly direction and approach nearer to each other and to Babylon at\r\nthe same time: nothing appears absurd in this statement of Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n39. The next objection of Hipparchus is likewise false. He attempts to\r\nprove that Eratosthenes, in his statement that the route from Thapsacus\r\nto the Caspian Gates is 10,000 stadia, gives this as the distance taken\r\nin a straight line; such not being the case, as in that instance the\r\ndistance would be much shorter. His mode of reasoning is after this\r\nfashion. He says, “According to Eratosthenes, the mouth of the Nile at\r\nCanopus,[600] and the Cyaneæ,[601] are under the same meridian, which is\r\ndistant from that of Thapsacus 6300 stadia. Now from the Cyaneæ to Mount\r\nCaspius, which is situated close to the defile[602] leading from Colchis\r\nto the Caspian Sea, there are 6600 stadia,[603] so that, with the\r\nexception of about 300 stadia, the distance from the meridian of the\r\nCyaneæ to that of Thapsacus, or to that of Mount Caspius, is the same:\r\nand both Thapsacus and Mount Caspius are, so to speak, under the same\r\nmeridian.[604] It follows from this that the Caspian Gates are about\r\nequi-distant between Thapsacus and Mount Caspius, but that the distance\r\nbetween them and Thapsacus is much less than the 10,000 stadia mentioned\r\nby Eratosthenes. Consequently, as the distance in a right line is much\r\nless than 10,000 stadia, this route, which he considered to be in a\r\nstraight course from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus, must have been a\r\ncircumbendibus.”\r\n\r\nTo this we reply, that Eratosthenes, as is usual in Geography, speaks of\r\nright lines, meridians, and parallels to the equator, with considerable\r\nlatitude, whereas Hipparchus criticizes him with geometrical nicety, as\r\nif every line had been measured with rule and compass. Hipparchus at the\r\nsame time himself frequently deciding as to right lines and parallels,\r\nnot by actual measurement, but mere conjecture. Such is the first error\r\nof this writer. A second is, that he never lays down the distances as\r\nEratosthenes has given them, nor yet reasons on the data furnished by\r\nthat writer, but from mere assumptions of his own coinage. Thus, where\r\nEratosthenes states that the distance from the mouth of the [Thracian\r\nBosphorus] to the Phasis is 8000 stadia, from thence to Dioscurias 600\r\nstadia,[605] and from Dioscurias to Caspius five days’ journey, (which\r\nHipparchus estimates at 1000 stadia,) the sum of these, as stated by\r\nEratosthenes, would amount to 9600 stadia. This Hipparchus abridges in\r\nthe following manner. From the Cyaneæ to the Phasis are 5600 stadia, and\r\nfrom the Phasis to the Caspius 1000 more.[606] Therefore it is no\r\nstatement of Eratosthenes that the Caspius and Thapsacus are under the\r\nsame meridian, but of Hipparchus himself. However, supposing\r\nEratosthenes says so, does it follow that the distance from the Caspius\r\nto the Caspian Gates, and that from Thapsacus to the same point, are\r\nequal.[607]\r\n\r\n40. In the second book of his Commentaries, Hipparchus, having again\r\nmooted the question concerning the mountains of the Taurus, of which we\r\nhave spoken sufficiently, proceeds with the northern parts of the\r\nhabitable earth. He then notices the statement of Eratosthenes\r\nconcerning the countries situated west of the Euxine,[608] namely, that\r\nthe three [principal] headlands [of this continent], the first the\r\nPeloponnesian, the second the Italian, the third the Ligurian, run from\r\nnorth [to south], enclosing the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Gulfs.[609]\r\nAfter this general exposition, Hipparchus proceeds to criticise each\r\npoint in detail, but rather on geometrical than geographical grounds; on\r\nthese subjects, however, the number of Eratosthenes’ errors is so\r\noverwhelming, as also of Timosthenes the author of the Treatise on the\r\nPorts, (whom Eratosthenes prefers above every other writer, though he\r\noften decides even against him,) that it does not seem to be worth my\r\ntime to review their faulty productions, nor even what Hipparchus has to\r\nsay about them; since he neither enumerates all their blunders, nor yet\r\nsets them right, but only points out how they falsify and contradict\r\neach other. Still any one might certainly object to the saying of\r\nEratosthenes, that Europe has but three headlands, and considering as\r\none that which terminates by the Peloponnesus, notwithstanding it is\r\nbroken up into so many divisions. In fact, Sunium[610] is as much a\r\npromontory as Laconia, and not very much less south than Malea,[611]\r\nforming a considerable bay,[612] and the Thracian Chersonesus[613] and\r\nSunium[614] form the Gulf of Melas,[615] and likewise those of\r\nMacedonia.[616] Added to this, it is manifest that the majority of the\r\ndistances are falsely stated, thus arguing an ignorance of geography\r\nscarcely credible, and so far from requiring geometrical demonstration\r\nthat it stands out prominent on the very face of the statements. For\r\nexample, the distance from Epidamnus[617] to the Thermaic Gulf[618] is\r\nabove 2000 stadia; Eratosthenes gives it at 900. So too he states the\r\ndistance from Alexandria to Carthage at 13,000[619] stadia; it is not\r\nmore than 9000, that is, if, as he himself tells us, Caria and Rhodes\r\nare under the same meridian as Alexandria,[620] and the Strait of\r\nMessina under the same as Carthage,[621] for every one is agreed that\r\nthe voyage from Caria to the Strait of Sicily does not exceed 9000\r\nstadia.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless permissible in very great distances to consider as under\r\none and the same meridian places which are not more east and west of\r\neach other than Carthage is west of the Strait;[622] but an error of\r\n3000 stadia is too much; and when he places Rome under the same meridian\r\nas Carthage, notwithstanding its being so far west of that city, it is\r\nbut the crowning proof of his extreme ignorance both of these places,\r\nand likewise of the other countries farther west as far as the Pillars\r\nof Hercules.\r\n\r\n41. Since Hipparchus does not furnish a Geography of his own, but merely\r\nreviews what is said in that of Eratosthenes, he ought to have gone\r\nfarther, and corrected the whole of that writer’s mistakes. As for\r\nourselves, it is only in those particulars where Eratosthenes is correct\r\n(and we acknowledge that he frequently errs) that we have thought it our\r\nduty to quote his own words, in order to reinstate them in their\r\nposition, and to defend him when he could be acquitted of the charges of\r\nHipparchus; never failing to break a lance with the latter writer\r\nwhenever his objections seemed to be the result of a mere propensity to\r\nfind fault. But when Eratosthenes is grossly mistaken, and the\r\nanimadversions of Hipparchus are just, we have thought it sufficient in\r\nour Geography to set him (Eratosthenes) right by merely stating facts as\r\nthey are. As the mistakes were so continual and numerous, it was better\r\nnot to mention them except in a sparse and general manner. This\r\nprinciple in the details we shall strive to carry out. In the present\r\ninstance we shall only remark, that Timosthenes, Eratosthenes, and those\r\nwho preceded them, were but ill acquainted with Iberia and Keltica,[623]\r\nand a thousand times less with Germany, Britain, and the land of the\r\nGetæ and Bastarnæ.[624] Their want of knowledge is also great in regard\r\nto Italy, the Adriatic, the Euxine, and the countries north of these.\r\nPossibly this last remark may be regarded as captious, since\r\nEratosthenes states, that as to distant countries, he has merely given\r\nthe admeasurements as he finds them supplied by others, without vouching\r\nfor their accuracy, although he sometimes adds whether the route\r\nindicated is more or less in a right line. We should not therefore\r\nsubject to a too rigorous examination distances as to which no one is\r\nagreed, after the manner Hipparchus does, both in regard to the places\r\nalready mentioned, and also to those of which Eratosthenes has given the\r\ndistance from Hyrcania to Bactria and the countries beyond, and those\r\nfrom Colchis to the Sea of Hyrcania. These are points where we should\r\nnot scrutinize him so narrowly as [when he describes] places situated in\r\nthe heart of our continent,[625] or others equally well known; and even\r\nthese should be regarded from a geographical rather than a geometrical\r\npoint of view. Hipparchus, at the end of the second book of his\r\nCommentaries on the Geography of Eratosthenes, having found fault with\r\ncertain statements relative to Ethiopia, tells us at the commencement of\r\nthe third, that his strictures, though to a certain point geographical,\r\nwill be mathematical for the most part. As for myself, I cannot find any\r\ngeography there. To me it seems entirely mathematical; but Eratosthenes\r\nhimself set the example; for he frequently runs into scientific\r\nspeculations, having little to do with the subject in hand, and which\r\nresult in vague and inexact conclusions. Thus he is a mathematician in\r\ngeography, and in mathematics a geographer; and so lies open to the\r\nattacks of both parties. In this third book, both he and Timosthenes get\r\nsuch severe justice, that there seems nothing left for us to do;\r\nHipparchus is quite enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We will now proceed to examine the statements made by Posidonius in\r\nhis Treatise on the Ocean. This Treatise contains much geographical\r\ninformation, sometimes given in a manner conformable to the subject, at\r\nothers too mathematical. It will not, therefore, be amiss to look into\r\nsome of his statements, both now and afterwards, as opportunity occurs,\r\ntaking care to confine ourselves within bounds. He deals simply with\r\ngeography, when he tells us that the earth is spheroidal and the\r\nuniverse too, and admits the necessary consequences of this hypothesis,\r\none of which is, that the earth contains five zones.\r\n\r\n2. Posidonius informs us that Parmenides was the first to make this\r\ndivision of the earth into five zones, but that he almost doubled the\r\nsize of the torrid zone, which is situated between the tropics, by\r\nbringing it beyond these into the temperate zones.[626] But according to\r\nAristotle the torrid zone is contained between the tropics, the\r\ntemperate zones occupying the whole space between the tropics and the\r\narctic circles.[627] Both of these divisions Posidonius justly condemns,\r\nfor the torrid zone is properly the space rendered uninhabitable by the\r\nheat. Whereas more than half of the space between the tropics is\r\ninhabited, as we may judge by the Ethiopians who dwell above Egypt. The\r\nequator divides the whole of this space into two equal parts. Now from\r\nSyene, which is the limit of the summer tropic, to Meroe, there are\r\n5000 stadia, and thence to the parallel of the Cinnamon region, where\r\nthe torrid zone commences, 3000 stadia. The whole of this distance has\r\nbeen measured, and it may be gone over either by sea or land; the\r\nremaining portion to the equator is, if we adopt the measure of the\r\nearth supplied by Eratosthenes, 8800 stadia. Therefore, as 16,800 is to\r\n8800, so is the space comprised between the tropics to the breadth of\r\nthe torrid zone.\r\n\r\nIf of the more recent measurements we prefer those which diminish the\r\nsize of the earth, such as that adopted by Posidonius, which is about\r\n180,000 stadia,[628] the torrid zone will still only occupy half, or\r\nrather more than half, of the space comprised between the tropics; but\r\nnever an equal space. [Respecting the system of Aristotle, Posidonius\r\nfarther says,] “Since it is not every latitude which has Arctic\r\nCircles,[629] and even those which do possess them have not the same,\r\nhow can any one determine by them the bounds of the temperate zones,\r\nwhich are immutable?” Nothing however is proved [against Aristotle] from\r\nthe fact that there are not Arctic Circles for every latitude, since\r\nthey exist for all the inhabitants of the temperate zone, on whose\r\naccount alone the zone receives its name of temperate. But the objection\r\nthat the Arctic Circles do not remain the same for every latitude, but\r\nshift their places, is excellent.[630]\r\n\r\n3. Posidonius, who himself divides the earth into zones, tells us that\r\n“five is the number best suited for the explanation of the celestial\r\nappearances, two of these are periscii,[631] which reach from the poles\r\nto the point where the tropics serve for Arctic Circles; two more are\r\nheteroscii,[632] which extend from the former to the inhabitants of the\r\ntropics, and one between the tropics, which is called amphiscius,[633]\r\nbut for matters relative to the earth, it is convenient to suppose two\r\nother narrow zones placed under the tropics, and divided by them into\r\ntwo halves, over which [every year] for the space of a fortnight, the\r\nsun is vertical.”[634] These zones are remarkable for being extremely\r\narid and sandy, producing no vegetation with the exception of\r\nsilphium,[635] and a parched grain somewhat resembling wheat. This is\r\ncaused by there being no mountains to attract the clouds and produce\r\nrain, nor any rivers flowing[636] through the country. The consequence\r\nis that the various species[637] are born with woolly hair, crumpled\r\nhorns, protruding lips, and wide nostrils; their extremities being as it\r\nwere gnarled. Within these zones also dwell the Ichthyophagi.[638] He\r\nfurther remarks, that these peculiarities are quite sufficient to\r\ndistinguish the zones in question: those which are farther south having\r\na more salubrious atmosphere, and being more fruitful and better\r\nsupplied with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Polybius supposes six zones: two situated between the poles and the\r\narctic circles; two between the arctic circles and the tropics; and two\r\nbetween the tropics which are divided by the equator. However, it\r\nappears to me that the division into five zones accords best both with\r\nthe order of external nature and geography. With external nature, as\r\nrespects the celestial phenomena, and the temperature of the atmosphere.\r\nWith respect to the celestial phenomena, as the Periscii and Amphiscii\r\nare thereby divided in the best possible manner, and it also forms an\r\nexcellent line of separation in regard to those who behold the stars\r\nfrom an opposite point of view.[639] With respect to the temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere, inasmuch as looked at in connexion with the sun, there\r\nare three main divisions, which influence in a remarkable degree both\r\nplants, animals, and every other animated thing, existing either in the\r\nair, or exposed to it, namely, excess of heat, want of heat, and a\r\nmoderate supply of heat. In the division into [five] zones, each of\r\nthese is correctly distinguished. The two frigid zones indicate the want\r\nof heat, being alike in the temperature of their atmosphere; the\r\ntemperate zones possess a moderate heat, and the remaining, or torrid\r\nzone, is remarkable for its excess of heat.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of this division in regard to geography is equally\r\napparent; the object of this science being to determine the limits of\r\nthat one of the temperate zones which we inhabit. To the east and west,\r\nit is true, the boundaries are formed by the sea, but to the north and\r\nsouth they are indicated by the atmosphere; which in the middle is of a\r\ngrateful temperature both to animals and plants, but on either side is\r\nrendered intemperate either through excess or defect of heat. To\r\nmanifest this threefold difference, the division of the globe into five\r\nzones becomes necessary. In fact, the division of the globe, by means of\r\nthe equator, into two hemispheres, the one northern, wherein we dwell,\r\nand the other southern, points to this threefold division, for the\r\nregions next the equator and torrid zone are uninhabitable on account of\r\nthe heat, those next the poles on account of the cold, but those in the\r\nmiddle are mild, and fitted for the habitation of man.\r\n\r\nPosidonius, in placing two zones under the tropics, pays no regard to\r\nthe reasons which influenced the division into five zones, nor is his\r\ndivision equally appropriate. It is no more than if he were to form his\r\ndivision into zones merely according to the [countries inhabited] by\r\ndifferent nations, calling one the Ethiopian, another the Scythian and\r\nKeltic,[640] and a third the Intermediate zone.\r\n\r\n2. Polybius, indeed, is wrong in bounding certain of his zones by the\r\narctic circles,[641] namely, the two which lie under them, and the two\r\nbetween these and the tropics. The impropriety of using shifting points\r\nto mark the limits of those which are fixed has been remarked before;\r\nand we have likewise objected to the plan of making the tropics the\r\nboundary of the torrid zone. However, in dividing the torrid zone into\r\ntwo parts [Polybius] seems to have been influenced by no inconsiderable\r\nreason, the same which led us to regard the whole earth as properly\r\ndivided by the equator into two hemispheres, north and south. We at once\r\nsee that by means of this division the torrid zone is divided into two\r\nparts, thus establishing a kind of uniformity; each hemisphere\r\nconsisting of three entire zones, respectively similar to each other.\r\nThus this partition[642] will admit of a division into six zones, but\r\nthe other does not allow of it at all. Supposing you cut the earth into\r\ntwo portions by a line drawn through the poles, you can find no\r\nsufficient cause for dividing the eastern and western hemispheres into\r\nsix zones; on the other hand, five would be preferable. For since both\r\nthe portions of the torrid zone, divided by the equator, are similar and\r\ncontiguous to each other, it would seem out of place and superfluous to\r\nseparate them; whereas the temperate and frigid zones respectively\r\nresemble each other, although lying apart. Wherefore, supposing the\r\nwhole earth to consist of these two hemispheres, it is sufficient to\r\ndivide them into five zones. If there be a temperate region under the\r\nequator, as Eratosthenes asserts, and is admitted by Polybius, (who\r\nadds, that it is the most elevated part of the earth,[643] and\r\nconsequently subject to the drenching rains occasioned by the monsoons\r\nbringing up from the north innumerable clouds, which discharge\r\nthemselves on the highest lands,) it would be better to suppose this a\r\nthird narrow temperate zone, than to extend the two temperate zones\r\nwithin the circles of the tropics. This supposition is supported by the\r\nstatements of Posidonius, that the course of the sun, whether in the\r\necliptic, or from east to west, appears most rapid in the region [of\r\nwhich we are speaking], because the rotations of that luminary are\r\nperformed with a speed increased in proportion to the greater size of\r\nthe circle.[644]\r\n\r\n3. Posidonius blames Polybius for asserting that the region of the\r\nearth, situated under the equator, is the highest, since a spherical\r\nbody being equal all round, no part can be described as high; and as to\r\nmountainous districts, there are none under the equator, it is on the\r\ncontrary a flat country, about the same level as the sea; as for the\r\nrains which swell the Nile, they descend from the mountains of Ethiopia.\r\nAlthough advancing this, he afterwards seems to adopt the other opinion,\r\nfor he says that he fancies there may be mountains under the equator,\r\naround which the clouds assembling from both of the temperate zones,\r\nproduce violent rains. Here is one manifest contradiction; again, in\r\nstating that the land under the equator is mountainous, another\r\ncontradiction appears. For they say that the ocean is confluent, how\r\nthen can they place mountains in the midst of it? unless they mean to\r\nsay that there are islands. However, whether such be the fact does not\r\nlie within the province of geography to determine, the inquiry would\r\nbetter be left to him who makes the ocean in particular his study.\r\n\r\n4. Posidonius, in speaking of those who have sailed round Africa, tells\r\nus that Herodotus was of opinion that some of those sent out by Darius\r\nactually performed this enterprise;[645] and that Heraclides of Pontus,\r\nin a certain dialogue, introduces one of the Magi presenting himself to\r\nGelon,[646] and declaring that he had performed this voyage; but he\r\nremarks that this wants proof. He also narrates how a certain Eudoxus of\r\nCyzicus,[647] sent with sacrifices and oblations to the Corean\r\ngames,[648] travelled into Egypt in the reign of Euergetes II.;[649] and\r\nbeing a learned man, and much interested in the peculiarities of\r\ndifferent countries, he made interest with the king and his ministers on\r\nthe subject, but especially for exploring the Nile. It chanced that a\r\ncertain Indian was brought to the king by the [coast]-guard of the\r\nArabian Gulf. They reported that they had found him in a ship, alone,\r\nand half dead: but that they neither knew who he was, nor where he came\r\nfrom, as he spoke a language they could not understand. He was placed in\r\nthe hands of preceptors appointed to teach him the Greek language. On\r\nacquiring which, he related how he had started from the coasts of India,\r\nbut lost his course, and reached Egypt alone, all his companions having\r\nperished with hunger; but that if he were restored to his country he\r\nwould point out to those sent with him by the king, the route by sea to\r\nIndia. Eudoxus was of the number thus sent. He set sail with a good\r\nsupply of presents, and brought back with him in exchange aromatics and\r\nprecious stones, some of which the Indians collect from amongst the\r\npebbles of the rivers, others they dig out of the earth, where they have\r\nbeen formed by the moisture, as crystals are formed with us.[650]\r\n\r\n[He fancied that he had made his fortune], however, he was greatly\r\ndeceived, for Euergetes took possession of the whole treasure. On the\r\ndeath of that prince, his widow, Cleopatra,[651] assumed the reins of\r\ngovernment, and Eudoxus was again despatched with a richer cargo than\r\nbefore. On his journey back, he was carried by the winds above\r\nEthiopia, and being thrown on certain [unknown] regions, he conciliated\r\nthe inhabitants by presents of grain, wine, and cakes of pressed figs,\r\narticles which they were without; receiving in exchange a supply of\r\nwater, and guides for the journey. He also wrote down several words of\r\ntheir language, and having found the end of a prow, with a horse carved\r\non it, which he was told formed part of the wreck of a vessel coming\r\nfrom the west, he took it with him, and proceeded on his homeward\r\ncourse. He arrived safely in Egypt, where no longer Cleopatra, but her\r\nson,[652] ruled; but he was again stripped of every thing on the\r\naccusation of having appropriated to his own uses a large portion of the\r\nmerchandise sent out.\r\n\r\nHowever, he carried the prow into the market-place, and exhibited it to\r\nthe pilots, who recognised it as being come from Gades.[653] The\r\nmerchants [of that place] employing large vessels, but the lesser\r\ntraders small ships, which they style horses, from the figures of that\r\nanimal borne on the prow, and in which they go out fishing around\r\nMaurusia,[654] as far as the Lixus.[655] Some of the pilots professed to\r\nrecognise the prow as that of a vessel which had sailed beyond the river\r\nLixus, but had not returned.[656]\r\n\r\nFrom this Eudoxus drew the conclusion, that it was possible to\r\ncircumnavigate Libya; he therefore returned home, and having collected\r\ntogether the whole of his substance, set out on his travels. First he\r\nvisited Dicæarchia,[657] and then Marseilles, and afterwards traversed\r\nthe whole coast as far as Gades. Declaring his enterprise everywhere as\r\nhe journeyed, he gathered money sufficient to equip a great ship, and\r\ntwo boats, resembling those used by pirates. On board these he placed\r\nsinging girls, physicians, and artisans of various kinds, and launching\r\ninto open sea, was carried towards India by steady westerly winds.[658]\r\nHowever, they who accompanied him becoming wearied with the voyage,\r\nsteered their course towards land, but much against his will, as he\r\ndreaded the force of the ebb and flow. What he feared actually occurred.\r\nThe ship grounded, but gently, so that it did not break up at once, but\r\nfell to pieces gradually, the goods and much of the timber of the ship\r\nbeing saved. With these he built a third vessel, closely resembling a\r\nship of fifty oars, and continuing his voyage, came amongst a people who\r\nspoke the same language as that some words of which he had on a former\r\noccasion committed to writing. He further discovered, that they were men\r\nof the same stock as those other Ethiopians, and also resembled those of\r\nthe kingdom of Bogus.[659] However, he abandoned his [intended] voyage\r\nto India, and returned home. On his voyage back he observed an\r\nuninhabited island, well watered and wooded, and carefully noted its\r\nposition. Having reached Maurusia in safety, he disposed of his vessels,\r\nand travelled by land to the court of Bogus. He recommended that\r\nsovereign to undertake an expedition thither.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was prevented on account of the fear of the [king’s]\r\nadvisers, lest the district should chance to expose them to treachery,\r\nby making known a route by which foreigners might come to attack them.\r\nEudoxus, however, became aware, that although it was given out that he\r\nwas himself to be sent on this proposed expedition, the real intent was\r\nto abandon him on some desert island. He therefore fled to the Roman\r\nterritory, and passed thence into Iberia. Again, he equipped two\r\nvessels, one round and the other long, furnished with fifty oars, the\r\nlatter framed for voyaging in the high seas, the other for coasting\r\nalong the shores. He placed on board agricultural implements, seed, and\r\nbuilders, and hastened on the same voyage, determined, if it should\r\nprove too long, to winter on the island he had before observed, sow his\r\nseed, and having reaped the harvest, complete the expedition he had\r\nintended from the beginning.\r\n\r\n5. “Thus far,” says Posidonius, “I have followed the history of Eudoxus.\r\nWhat happened afterwards is probably known to the people of Gades and\r\nIberia;” “but,” says he, “all these things only demonstrate more clearly\r\nthe fact, that the inhabited earth is entirely surrounded by the ocean.”\r\n\r\n                 “By no continent fettered in,\r\n   But boundless in its flow, and free from soil.”\r\n\r\nPosidonius is certainly a most strange writer; he considers that the\r\nvoyage of the Magus,[660] related by Heraclides, wants sufficient\r\nevidence, and also the account given by Herodotus of those sent out [to\r\nexplore] by Darius. But this Bergæan[661] nonsense, either the coinage\r\nof his own brain, or of some other story-teller, in whom he trusts, he\r\npretends to be worthy of our belief. But in the first place, what is\r\nthere credible in this tale of the Indian missing his way? The Arabian\r\nGulf, which resembles a river, is narrow, and in length is from 5000 to\r\n10,000 stadia up to its mouth, where it is narrowest of all. It is not\r\nlikely that the Indians in their voyage out would have entered this Gulf\r\nby mistake. The extreme narrowness of the mouth must have warned them of\r\ntheir error. And if they entered it voluntarily, then there was no\r\nexcuse for introducing the pretext of mistake and uncertain winds. And\r\nhow did they suffer all of themselves but one to perish through hunger?\r\nAnd how was it that this surviver was able to manage the ship, which\r\ncould not have been a small one either, fitted as it was for traversing\r\nsuch vast seas? What must have been his aptitude in learning the\r\nlanguage of the country, and thus being able to persuade the king of his\r\ncompetence, as leader of the expedition? And how came it that Euergetes\r\nwas in want of such guides, so many being already acquainted with this\r\nsea? How was it that he who was sent by the inhabitants of Cyzicus to\r\ncarry libations and sacrifices, should forsake his city and sail for\r\nIndia? How was it that so great an affair was intrusted to him? And how\r\ncame it that on his return, after being deprived of every thing contrary\r\nto expectation, and disgraced, a yet larger cargo of goods was intrusted\r\nto him? And when he had again returned into Ethiopia, what cause induced\r\nhim to write down the words, or to inquire whence came the portion of\r\nthe prow of the boat? For to learn that it was a ship of some sailing\r\nfrom the west, would have been no information to him, as he himself\r\nwould have to sail from the west on his voyage back. When, on his return\r\nto Alexandria, he was detected in having appropriated to himself much of\r\nthe merchandise, how came it that he was not punished, but allowed to go\r\nabout interrogating the pilots, and exhibiting his bit of prow? And that\r\none of these fellows actually recognised the relic, is it not delicious!\r\nEudoxus too believed it, this is still richer; and inspired by the hope,\r\nhastens home, and then starts on a voyage beyond the Pillars of\r\nHercules! But he could never have left Alexandria without a passport,\r\nstill less after having stolen the royal property. To set sail on the\r\nsly was impossible, as the port and every other exit was kept by a\r\nnumerous guard, which still exists, as we very well know who have lived\r\nin Alexandria for a long time, although it is not so strict since the\r\nRomans have had possession, but under the kings the guards were\r\ninfinitely more alert. But allowing that he reached Gades, that he there\r\nconstructed ships, and sailed thence with quite a royal fleet, when his\r\nvessel was shattered, by what means was he able to construct a third\r\nboat in a desert land? And when, being again on his voyage, he found\r\nthat the Ethiopians of the West spoke the same language as those of the\r\nEast, how came it that he, so proud of his travelling propensities,\r\nforgot the completion of his voyage, when he must have had so good an\r\nexpectation that there was but little now left unexplored, but\r\nrelinquishing these prospects, set his mind on the expedition being\r\nundertaken by Bogus? How did he become acquainted with the snare spread\r\nfor him by that king? And what advantage would have accrued to Bogus by\r\nmaking away with the man, rather than by dismissing him? When Eudoxus\r\nlearned the plot against himself, what means had he to escape to safer\r\nquarters? It is true that not one of these situations was actually\r\nimpossible, but still they were difficult circumstances, such as one\r\nrarely escapes from by any prosperous fortune. However, he always came\r\noff with good luck, notwithstanding he was never out of danger. Besides\r\nthis, how did it happen, that having escaped from Bogus, he was not\r\nafraid to sail round Africa a second time, with all the requisites for\r\ntaking up his abode on the island? All this too closely resembles the\r\nfalsehoods of Pytheas, Euhemerus, and Antiphanes. They however may be\r\npardoned; for their only aim was that of the juggler. But who can\r\nforgive a demonstrator and philosopher, and one too striving to be at\r\nthe head of their order? it is really too bad!\r\n\r\n6. However, he is right in attributing to earthquakes and other similar\r\ncauses, which we also have enumerated, the risings, slips, and changes\r\nwhich at various periods come over the earth. He did well, too, in\r\nciting the opinion of Plato, “that the tradition concerning the Island\r\nof Atlantis might be received as something more than a mere fiction, it\r\nhaving been related by Solon on the authority of the Egyptian priests,\r\nthat this island, almost as large as a continent, was formerly in\r\nexistence, although now it had disappeared.” Posidonius thinks it better\r\nto quote this than to say, “He who brought it into existence can also\r\ncause it to disappear, as the poet did the wall of the Achivi.”[662] He\r\n(Posidonius) is also of opinion that the emigration of the Cimbrians and\r\nother kindred races from their native territory, was gradual, and\r\noccasioned by the inundation of the sea, and by no means a sudden\r\nmovement.[663] He supposes that the length of the inhabited earth is\r\nabout 70,000 stadia, being the half of the whole circle on which it is\r\ntaken; so that, says he, starting from the west, one might, aided by a\r\ncontinual east wind, reach India in so many thousand stadia.\r\n\r\n7. Next he undertakes to find fault with those who gave to the\r\ncontinents their present division, instead of marking them out by lines\r\ndrawn parallel to the equator, by which means the different animals,\r\nplants, and temperatures would have been distinguished, according as\r\nthey approached the frigid or the torrid zones; so that each continent\r\nwould have formed a kind of zone. Afterwards, however, he overturns and\r\ngives up altogether this view, bestowing every commendation on the\r\nexisting system, and thus making his argument altogether worthless and\r\nof no avail. In fact, the various arrangements [of a country] are not\r\nthe result of premeditation, any more than the diversities of nations\r\nor languages; they all depend on circumstances and chance. Arts, forms\r\nof government, and modes of life, arising from certain [internal]\r\nsprings, flourish under whatever climate they may be situated; climate,\r\nhowever, has its influence, and therefore while some peculiarities are\r\ndue to the nature of the country, others are the result of institutions\r\nand education. It is not owing to the nature of the country, but rather\r\nto their education, that the Athenians cultivate eloquence, while the\r\nLacedæmonians do not; nor yet the Thebans, who are nearer still. Neither\r\nare the Babylonians and Egyptians philosophers by nature, but by reason\r\nof their institutions and education. In like manner the excellence of\r\nhorses, oxen, and other animals, results not alone from the places where\r\nthey dwell, but also from their breeding. Posidonius confounds all these\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nIn praising the division of the continents as it now stands, he advances\r\nas an argument the difference between the Indians and the Ethiopians of\r\nLibya, the former being more robust, and less dried by the heat of the\r\nclimate. It is on this account that Homer, who includes them all under\r\nthe title of Ethiopians, describes them as being separated into two\r\ndivisions,\r\n\r\n   “These eastward situate, those toward the west.”[664]\r\n\r\n[Crates], to support his hypothesis, supposes another inhabited earth,\r\nof which Homer certainly knew nothing; and says that the passage ought\r\nto be read thus, “towards the descending sun,” viz. when having passed\r\nthe meridian, it begins to decline.\r\n\r\n8. First, then, the Ethiopians next Egypt are actually separated into\r\ntwo divisions; one part being in Asia, the other in Libya, otherwise\r\nthere is no distinction between them. But it was not on this account\r\nthat Homer divided the Ethiopians, nor yet because he was acquainted\r\nwith the physical superiority of the Indians, (for it is not probable\r\nthat Homer had the slightest idea of the Indians, since, according to\r\nthe assertion of Eudoxus, Euergetes was both ignorant of India, and of\r\nthe voyage thither,) but his division rather resulted from the cause we\r\nformerly mentioned. We have shown that as for the alteration of Crates,\r\nit makes no difference whether it be read so or not. Posidonius,\r\nhowever, says that it does make a difference, and would be better\r\naltered into “towards the descending [sun].” But in what can this be\r\nsaid to differ from “towards the west,” since the whole section of the\r\nhemisphere west of the meridian is styled “the west,” not only the mere\r\nsemicircle of the horizon. This is manifested by the following\r\nexpression of Aratus,\r\n\r\n   “Where the extremities of the west and east blend together.”[665]\r\n\r\nHowever, if the reading of Posidonius be preferable to that of Crates,\r\nany one may likewise claim for it a superiority over that of\r\nAristarchus. So much for Posidonius. There are, however, many\r\nparticulars relating to Geography, which we shall bring under\r\ndiscussion; others relating to Physics, which must be examined\r\nelsewhere, or altogether disregarded; for he is much too fond of\r\nimitating Aristotle’s propensity for diving into _causes_, a subject\r\nwhich we [Stoics] scrupulously avoid, simply because of the extreme\r\ndarkness in which all _causes_ are enveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Polybius, in his Chorography of Europe, tells us that it is not his\r\nintention to examine the writings of the ancient geographers, but the\r\nstatements of those who have criticised them, such as Dicæarchus,\r\nEratosthenes, (who was the last of those who [in his time] had laboured\r\non geography,) and Pytheas, by whom many have been deceived. It is this\r\nlast writer who states that he travelled all over Britain on foot, and\r\nthat the island is above 40,000 stadia in circumference. It is likewise\r\nhe who describes Thule and other neighbouring places, where, according\r\nto him, neither earth, water, nor air exist, separately, but a sort of\r\nconcretion of all these, resembling marine sponge, in which the earth,\r\nthe sea, and all things were suspended, thus forming, as it were, a link\r\nto unite the whole together. It can neither be travelled over nor sailed\r\nthrough. As for the substance, he affirms that he has beheld it with his\r\nown eyes; the rest, he reports on the authority of others. So much for\r\nthe statements of Pytheas, who tells us, besides, that after he had\r\nreturned thence, he traversed the whole coasts of Europe from Gades to\r\nthe Don.\r\n\r\n2. Polybius asks, “How is it possible that a private individual, and one\r\ntoo in narrow circumstances, could ever have performed such vast\r\nexpeditions by sea and land? And how could Eratosthenes, who hesitates\r\nwhether he may rely on his statements in general, place such entire\r\nconfidence in what that writer narrates concerning Britain, Gades, and\r\nIberia?” says he, “it would have been better had Eratosthenes trusted to\r\nthe Messenian[666] rather than to this writer. The former merely\r\npretends to have sailed into one [unknown] country, viz. Panchæa, but\r\nthe latter, that he has visited the whole of the north of Europe as far\r\nas the ends of the earth; which statement, even had it been made by\r\nMercury, we should not have believed. Nevertheless Eratosthenes, who\r\nterms Euhemerus a Bergæan, gives credit to Pytheas, although even\r\nDicæarchus would not believe him.”\r\n\r\nThis argument, “although even Dicæarchus would not believe him,” is\r\nridiculous, just as if Eratosthenes ought to take for his standard a\r\nwriter whom Polybius is himself for ever complaining of.[667]\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of Eratosthenes respecting the western and northern\r\nportions of Europe, we have before remarked. But both he and Dicæarchus\r\nmust be pardoned for this, as neither of them were personally familiar\r\nwith those localities. But how can one excuse Polybius and Posidonius?\r\nespecially Polybius, who treats as mere hearsay what Eratosthenes and\r\nDicæarchus report concerning the distances of various places; and many\r\nother matters, about which, though he blames them, he is not himself\r\nfree from error. Dicæarchus states that there are 10,000 stadia from the\r\nPeloponnesus to the Pillars, and something above this number from the\r\nPeloponnesus to the recess of the Adriatic.[668] He supposes 3000 stadia\r\nbetween the Peloponnesus and the Strait of Sicily; thus there would\r\nremain 7000 between the Strait of Sicily and the Pillars.[669]\r\n\r\n“I will not inquire,” says Polybius, “whether the statement concerning\r\nthe 3000 stadia is correct or not, but 7000 stadia is not the correct\r\nmeasure [from the Strait of Messina to the Pillars of Hercules], whether\r\ntaken along the sea-shore, or right across the sea. The coast closely\r\nresembles an obtuse angle, one side reaching to the Strait of Sicily,\r\nthe other to the Pillars, the vertex being Narbonne. Now let a triangle\r\nbe constructed, having for its base a right line drawn through the sea,\r\nand its sides forming the aforementioned angle. The side reaching from\r\nthe Strait of Sicily to Narbonne is above 11,200 stadia, while the other\r\nis below 8000. Now the greatest distance from Europe to Libya, across\r\nthe Tyrrhenian Sea,[670] is not above 3000 stadia, and across the Sea of\r\nSardinia[671] it is less still. But supposing that it too is 3000\r\nstadia, add to this 2000 stadia, the depth of the bay at Narbonne, as a\r\nperpendicular from the vertex to the base of the obtuse-angled\r\ntriangle. It will, then, be clear even to the geometrical powers of a\r\nchild, that the entire coast from the Strait of Sicily to the Pillars,\r\ndoes not exceed by more than 500 stadia the right line drawn across the\r\nsea; adding to these the 3000 stadia from the Peloponnesus to the Strait\r\nof Sicily, the whole taken together will give a straight line[672] above\r\ndouble the length assigned by Dicæarchus; and, according to his system,\r\nyou must add in addition to these the stadia at the recess of the\r\nAdriatic.”\r\n\r\n3. True, dear Polybius, (one might say,) this error [of Dicæarchus] is\r\nmanifested by the proof which you yourself have given when you inform us\r\nthat from the Peloponnesus to Leucas[673] there are 700 stadia; from\r\nthence to Corcyra[674] the same number; and the same number again from\r\nCorcyra to the Ceraunian Mountains;[675] and from the Ceraunian\r\nMountains to Iapygia,[676] following the coast of Illyria on the right,\r\n6150 stadia.[677] But the statement of Dicæarchus, that the distance\r\nfrom the Strait of Sicily to the Pillars is 7000 stadia, and also your\r\nview of the matter, are both of them equally incorrect. For almost every\r\none is agreed that the distance measured straight across the sea is\r\n12,000 stadia, and this coincides with the received calculation of the\r\nlength of the inhabited earth, which is estimated at above 70,000\r\nstadia; the western portion of this from the Gulf of Issus[678] to the\r\nextreme western point of Iberia is little less than 30,000 stadia, and\r\nis thus calculated: from the Gulf of Issus to Rhodes 5000 stadia; from\r\nthence to Cape Salmonium,[679] which forms the eastern extremity of\r\nCrete, 1000; the length of Crete to Criu-metopon[680] above 2000; thence\r\nto Cape Pachynus[681] in Sicily 4500, and from Pachynus to the Strait of\r\nSicily above 1000 stadia; the run from the Strait to the Pillars 12,000;\r\nand lastly, from the Pillars to the extremity of the said\r\npromontory[682] of Iberia, about 3000 stadia.[683]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the perpendicular[684] is not correct, supposing it\r\ntrue that Narbonne lies under almost the same parallel as Marseilles,\r\nand that this latter place is under the same parallel as Byzantium;\r\nwhich is the opinion of Hipparchus. Now the line drawn across the sea\r\nlies under the same parallel as the Strait [of the Pillars] and Rhodes;\r\nand the distance from Rhodes to Byzantium, which both lie under the same\r\nmeridian, is estimated at about 5000 stadia; to which the\r\nabove-mentioned perpendicular ought to be equal. But since they say that\r\nfrom the recess of the Galatic Gulf, the greatest distance across the\r\nsea from Europe to Libya is 5000 stadia, it seems to me that either\r\nthere is some error in this statement, or that at this point Libya must\r\nincline very much to the north, and so come under the same parallel as\r\nthe Pillars. Polybius is likewise mistaken in telling us that this said\r\nperpendicular terminates close to Sardinia; for instead of being close\r\nto Sardinia, it is far west thereof, having almost the whole of the sea\r\nof Liguria[685] between it and that island. Besides this he makes the\r\nlength of the sea-coast too great; but this [error] is not so\r\nconsiderable [as the two preceding].\r\n\r\n4. After this Polybius proceeds to set right the mistakes of\r\nEratosthenes. In this he is sometimes successful; at others his\r\ncorrections are for the worse. For example, Eratosthenes gives 300\r\nstadia from Ithaca to Corcyra; Polybius makes it above 900. From\r\nEpidamnus to Thessalonica Eratosthenes allows 900 stadia; Polybius says\r\nabove 2000. In these instances he is correct. But where Eratosthenes\r\nstates that from Marseilles to the Pillars there are 7000 stadia, and\r\nfrom the Pyrenees [to the same place] 6000, and Polybius alters this to\r\nmore than 9000 from Marseilles, and little less than 8000 from the\r\nPyrenees,[686] he is quite mistaken, and not so near to the truth as\r\nEratosthenes. For all are now agreed that, barring the indirectness of\r\nthe roads, the whole length of Iberia is not more than 6000 stadia[687]\r\nfrom the Pyrenees to its western limits; notwithstanding Polybius gives\r\n8000 stadia for the length of the river Tagus, from its source to its\r\noutlets, and this in a straight line without any reference to its\r\nsinuosities, which in fact never enter into the geographical estimate,\r\nalthough the sources of the Tagus are above 1000 stadia from the\r\nPyrenees. His remark is quite correct, that Eratosthenes knew little\r\nabout Iberia, and on this account sometimes makes conflicting statements\r\nconcerning it. He tells us, for example, that the portion of this\r\ncountry situated on the sea-coast as far as Gades is inhabited by\r\nGalatæ,[688] who possess western Europe as far as Gades; nevertheless,\r\nin his account of Iberia he seems quite to have forgotten this, and\r\nmakes no mention of these Galatæ whatever.\r\n\r\n5. Again, however, Polybius makes an incorrect assertion, in stating\r\nthat the whole length of Europe is unequal to that of Africa and Asia\r\ntaken together. He tells us “that the entrance at the Pillars\r\ncorresponds in direction to the equinoctial west, and that the Don flows\r\nfrom the summer rising, consequently the length of Europe is less than\r\nthat of Asia and Africa taken together by the space between the summer\r\nrising[689] and the equinoctial rising,[690] since Asia occupies the\r\neastern portion of the northern semicircle. Now, in addition to the\r\nobscurity which Polybius throws over subjects which might have been\r\nsimply stated, it is false that the river Don flows from the summer\r\nrising. For all who are acquainted with these localities inform us that\r\nthis river flows from the north into the Mæotis, so that the mouth of\r\nthe river lies under the same meridian as that of the Mæotis; and so in\r\nfact does the whole river as far as is known.[691]\r\n\r\n6. Equally unworthy of credit is the statement of those who tell us,\r\nthat the Don rises in the vicinity of the Danube, and flows from the\r\nwest; they do not remember that between these are the Dniester, the\r\nDnieper, and the Bog, all great rivers, which flow [into the Euxine\r\nSea]; one runs parallel to the Danube, the other two to the Don. Now if\r\nat the present day we are ignorant of the sources both of the Dniester,\r\nand also of the Dnieper and Bog, the regions farther north must\r\ncertainly be still less known. It is therefore a fictitious and idle\r\nassertion, that the Don crosses these rivers, and then turns northward\r\non its way to discharge itself into the Mæotis, it being well known that\r\nthe outlets to this river are in the most northern and eastern portions\r\nof the lake.[692]\r\n\r\nNo less idle is the statement which has also been advanced, that the\r\nDon, after crossing the Caucasus, flows northward, and then turns\r\ntowards the Mæotis.[693] No one, however, [with the exception of\r\nPolybius,] made this river flow from the east. If such were its course,\r\nour best geographers would never have told us that its direction was\r\ncontrary to that of the Nile, and, so to speak, diametrically opposite\r\nthereto, as if the course of both rivers lay under the same meridian.\r\n\r\n7. Further, the length of the inhabited earth is measured on a line\r\nparallel with the equator, as it is in this direction that its greatest\r\nlength lies: in the same way with respect to each of the continents, we\r\nmust take their length as it lies between two meridians. The measure of\r\nthese lengths consists of a certain number of stadia, which we obtain\r\neither by going over the places themselves, or roads or ways parallel\r\nthereto. Polybius abandons this method, and adopts the new way of taking\r\nthe segment of the northern semicircle comprised between the summer\r\nrising and the equinoctial rising. But no one ought to calculate by\r\nvariable rules or measures in determining the length of fixed distances:\r\nnor yet should he make use of the phenomena of the heavens, which appear\r\ndifferent when observed from different points, for distances which have\r\ntheir length determined by themselves and remain unchanged. The length\r\nof a country never varies, but depends upon itself; whereas, the\r\nequinoctial rising and setting, and the summer and winter rising and\r\nsetting, depend not on themselves, but on our position [with respect to\r\nthem]. As we shift from place to place, the equinoctial rising and\r\nsetting, and the winter and summer rising and setting, shift with us;\r\nbut the length of a continent always remains the same. To make the Don\r\nand the Nile the bounds of these continents, is nothing out of the way,\r\nbut it is something strange to employ for this purpose the equinoctial\r\nrising and the summer rising.\r\n\r\n8. Of the many promontories formed by Europe, a better description is\r\ngiven by Polybius than by Eratosthenes; but even his is not sufficient.\r\nEratosthenes only names three; one at the Pillars of Hercules, where\r\nIberia is situated; a second at the Strait of Sicily, and containing\r\nItaly; the third terminated by the Cape of Malea,[694] comprising all\r\nthe countries situated between the Adriatic, the Euxine, and the Don.\r\nThe two former of these Polybius describes in the same manner as\r\nEratosthenes, but the third, which is equally terminated by the Cape of\r\nMalea[695] and Cape Sunium,[696] [he makes to] comprehend the whole of\r\nGreece, Illyria, and some portion of Thrace. [He supposes] a fourth,\r\ncontaining the Thracian Chersonesus and the countries contiguous to the\r\nStrait,[697] betwixt Sestos and Abydos. This is occupied by the\r\nThracians. Also a fifth, about the Kimmerian Bosphorus and the mouth of\r\nthe Mæotis. Let us allow [to Polybius] his two former [promontories],\r\nthey are clearly distinguished by unmistakeable bays; the first by the\r\nbay between Calpe[698] and the Sacred Promontory[699] where Gades[700]\r\nis situated, as also by the sea between the Pillars and Sicily; the\r\nsecond[701] by the latter sea and the Adriatic,[702] although it may be\r\nobjected that the extremity of Iapygia,[703] being a promontory in\r\nitself, causes Italy to have a double cape. But as for the remaining\r\n[promontories of Polybius], they are plainly much more irregular, and\r\ncomposed of many parts, and require some other division. So likewise his\r\nplan of dividing [Europe] into six parts, similar to that of the\r\npromontories, is liable to objection.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will set to rights each of these errors separately, as we\r\nmeet with them, as well as the other blunders into which he has fallen\r\nin his description of Europe, and the journey round Africa. For the\r\npresent we think that we have sufficiently dwelt on those of our\r\npredecessors whom we have thought proper to introduce as testimonies in\r\nour behalf, that both in the matter of correction and addition we had\r\nample cause to undertake the present work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After these criticisms on the writers who have preceded us, we must\r\nnow confine our attention to the fulfilment of our promise. We start\r\nwith a maxim we laid down at the commencement, that whoever undertakes\r\nto write a Chorography, should receive as axioms certain physical and\r\nmathematical propositions, and frame the rest of his work in accordance\r\nwith, and in full reliance on, these principles. We have already stated\r\n[our opinion], that neither builder nor architect could build house or\r\ncity properly and as it ought to be, unless acquainted with the _clima_\r\nof the place, its position in respect to celestial appearances, its\r\nshape, magnitude, degree of heat and cold, and similar facts; much less\r\nshould he [be without such information] who undertakes to describe the\r\nsituation of the various regions of the inhabited earth.\r\n\r\nRepresent to the mind on one and the same plane-surface Iberia and India\r\nwith the intermediate countries, and define likewise the west, the east,\r\nand the south, which are common to every country. To a man already\r\nacquainted with the arrangement and motions of the heavens, and aware\r\nthat in reality the surface of the earth is spherical, although here for\r\nthe sake of illustration represented as a plane, this will give a\r\nsufficiently exact idea of the geographical [position of the various\r\ncountries], but not to one who is unacquainted with those matters. The\r\ntourist travelling over vast plains like those of Babylon, or journeying\r\nby sea, may fancy that the whole country stretched before, behind, and\r\non either side of him is a plane-surface; he may be unacquainted with\r\nthe counter-indications of the celestial phenomena, and with the\r\nmotions and appearance of the sun and stars, in respect to us. But such\r\nfacts as these should ever be present to the mind of those who compose\r\nGeographies. The traveller, whether by sea or land, is directed by\r\ncertain common appearances, which answer equally for the direction both\r\nof the unlearned and of the man of the world. Ignorant of astronomy, and\r\nunacquainted with the varied aspect of the heavens, he beholds the sun\r\nrise and set, and attain the meridian, but without considering how this\r\ntakes place. Such knowledge could not aid the object he has in view, any\r\nmore than to know whether the country he chances to be in may be under\r\nthe same latitude as his own or not. Even should he bestow a slight\r\nattention to the subject, on all mathematical points he will adopt the\r\nopinions of the place; and every country has certain mistaken views of\r\nthese matters. But it is not for any particular nation, nor for the man\r\nof the world who cares nothing for abstract mathematics, still less is\r\nit for the reaper or ditcher, that the geographer labours; but it is for\r\nhim who is convinced that the earth is such as mathematicians declare it\r\nto be, and who admits every other fact resulting from this hypothesis.\r\nHe requests that those who approach him shall have already settled this\r\nin their minds as a fact, that they may be able to lend their whole\r\nattention to other points. He will advance nothing which is not a\r\nconsequence of these primary facts; therefore those who hear him, if\r\nthey have a knowledge of mathematics, will readily be able to turn his\r\ninstructions to account; for those who are destitute of this information\r\nhe does not pretend to expound Geography.\r\n\r\n2. Those who write on the science of Geography should trust entirely for\r\nthe arrangement of the subject they are engaged on to the geometers, who\r\nhave measured the whole earth; they in their turn to astronomers; and\r\nthese again to natural philosophers. Now natural philosophy is one of\r\nthe perfect sciences.[704]\r\n\r\nThe “perfect sciences” they define as those which, depending on no\r\nexternal hypothesis, have their origin, and the evidence of their\r\npropositions, in themselves. Here are a few of the facts established by\r\nnatural philosophers.[705]\r\n\r\nThe earth and heavens are spheroidal.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of all bodies having weight, is to a centre.\r\n\r\nFurther, the earth being spheroidal, and having the same centre as the\r\nheavens, is motionless, as well as the axis which passes through both it\r\nand the heavens. The heavens turn round both the earth and its axis,\r\nfrom east to west. The fixed stars turn round with it, at the same rate\r\nas the whole.[706] These fixed stars follow in their course parallel\r\ncircles; the principal of which are, the equator, the two tropics, and\r\nthe arctic circles. While the planets, the sun, and the moon, describe\r\ncertain oblique circles comprehended within the zodiac. Admitting these\r\npoints in whole or in part, astronomers proceed to treat of other\r\nmatters, [such as] the motions [of the stars], their revolutions,\r\neclipses, size, relative distance, and a thousand similar particulars.\r\nOn their side, geometers, when measuring the size of the entire earth,\r\navail themselves of the data furnished by the natural philosopher and\r\nastronomer; and the geographer on his part makes use of those of the\r\ngeometer.\r\n\r\n3. The heavens and the earth must be supposed to be divided each into\r\nfive zones, and the celestial zones to possess the same names as those\r\nbelow. The motives for such a division into zones we have already\r\ndetailed. These zones may be distinguished by circles drawn parallel to\r\nthe equator, on either side of it. Two of these will separate the torrid\r\nfrom the temperate zones, and the remaining two, the temperate from the\r\nfrigid. To each celestial circle there shall be one corresponding on\r\nearth, and bearing the same name, and likewise zone for zone. The [two]\r\nzones capable of being inhabited, are styled temperate. The remaining\r\n[three] are uninhabitable, one on account of the heat, the others\r\nbecause of the extreme cold. The same is the case with regard to the\r\ntropical, and also to the arctic circles, in respect of those countries\r\nfor which arctic circles can be said to exist. Circles on the earth are\r\nsupposed, corresponding to those in the heavens, and bearing the same\r\nname, one for one.\r\n\r\nAs the whole heaven is separated into two parts by its equator, it\r\nfollows that the earth must, by its equator, be similarly divided. The\r\ntwo hemispheres, both celestial and terrestrial, are distinguished into\r\nnorth and south. Likewise the torrid zone, which is divided into two\r\nhalves by the equator, is distinguished as having a northern and\r\nsouthern side. Hence it is evident that of the two temperate zones, one\r\nshould be called northern, the other southern, according to the\r\nhemisphere to which it belongs. The northern hemisphere is that\r\ncontaining the temperate zone, in which looking from east to west, you\r\nwill have the pole on your right hand, and the equator on the left, or,\r\nin which, looking south, the west will be on the right hand, and the\r\neast on the left. The southern hemisphere is exactly the contrary to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we are in one or other of these hemispheres, namely,\r\nthe north; we cannot be in both:\r\n\r\n   “Broad rivers roll, and awful floods between,\r\n   But chief the ocean.”[707]\r\n\r\nAnd next is the torrid zone. But neither is there any ocean in the midst\r\nof the earth wherein we dwell, dividing the whole thereof, nor yet have\r\nwe any torrid region. Nor is there any portion of it to be found in\r\nwhich the _climata_ are opposite to those which have been described as\r\ncharacterizing the northern temperate zone.\r\n\r\n4. Assuming these data, and availing himself likewise of astronomical\r\nobservations, by which the position of every place is properly\r\ndetermined, whether with respect to the circles parallel to the equator,\r\nor to those which cut these latter at right angles, in the direction of\r\nthe poles, the geometer measures the region in which he dwells, and\r\n[judges of the extent of] others by comparing the distance [between the\r\ncorresponding celestial signs]. By this means he discovers the distance\r\nfrom the equator to the pole, which is a quarter of the largest circle\r\nof the earth; having obtained this, he has only to multiply by four, the\r\nresult is the [measure of the] perimeter of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as he who takes the measures of the earth, borrows\r\nthe foundation of his calculations from the astronomer, who himself is\r\nindebted to the natural philosopher, so in like manner the geographer\r\nadopts certain facts laid down as established by the geometer, before\r\nsetting forth his description of the earth we inhabit; its size, form,\r\nnature, and the proportion it bears to the whole earth. These latter\r\npoints are the peculiar business of the geographer. He will next enter\r\non a particular description of every thing deserving notice, whether on\r\nland or sea; he will likewise point out whatever has been improperly\r\nstated by those who have preceded him, especially by those who are\r\nregarded as chief authorities in these matters.[708]\r\n\r\n5. Let it be supposed that the earth and sea together form a spheroidal\r\nbody, and preserve one and the same level in all the seas. For though\r\nsome portions of the earth may be higher, yet this bears so small a\r\nrelation to the size of the whole mass, as need not be noticed. The\r\nspheroid in consequence is not so minutely exact as one might be made by\r\nthe aid of a turner’s instrument, or as would answer the definition of a\r\ngeometer, still in general appearance, and looked at roughly, it is a\r\nspheroid. Let the earth be supposed to consist of five zones, with (1.)\r\nthe equatorial circle described round it, (2.) another parallel to\r\nthis,[709] and defining the frigid zone of the northern hemisphere, and\r\n(3.) a circle passing through the poles, and cutting the two preceding\r\ncircles at right angles. The northern hemisphere contains two quarters\r\nof the earth, which are bounded by the equator and the circle passing\r\nthrough the poles.\r\n\r\nEach of these [quarters] should be supposed to contain a four-sided\r\ndistrict, its northern side being composed of one half of the parallel\r\nnext the pole; its southern, by the half of the equator; and its\r\nremaining sides, by [two] segments of the circle drawn through the\r\npoles, opposite to each other, and equal in length. In one of these\r\nquadrilaterals (which of them is of no consequence) the earth that we\r\ninhabit is situated, surrounded by sea, and similar to an island. This,\r\nas we said before, is evident both to our senses and to our reason. But\r\nshould any one doubt thereof, it makes no difference so far as Geography\r\nis concerned, whether you suppose the portion of the earth we inhabit to\r\nbe an island, or only admit what we know from experience, viz. that\r\nwhether you start from the east or west, you may sail all round it.\r\nCertain intermediate spaces may have been left [unexplored], but these\r\nare as likely to be occupied by sea, as uninhabited lands. The object of\r\nthe geographer is to describe known countries; those which are unknown\r\nhe passes over equally with those beyond the limits of the inhabited\r\nearth. It will therefore be sufficient for describing the contour of the\r\nisland we have been speaking of, if we join by a right line the utmost\r\npoints which, up to this time, have been explored by voyagers along the\r\ncoast on either side.\r\n\r\n6. Let it be supposed that this island is contained in one of the above\r\nquadrilaterals; we must obtain its apparent magnitude by subtracting our\r\nhemisphere from the whole extent of the earth, from this take the half,\r\nand from this again the quadrilateral, in which we state our earth to be\r\nsituated. We may judge also by analogy of the figure of the whole earth,\r\nby supposing that it accords with those parts with which we are\r\nacquainted. Now as the portion of the northern hemisphere, between the\r\nequator and the parallel next the [north] pole, resembles a vertebre or\r\njoint of the back-bone in shape, and as the circle which passes through\r\nthe pole divides at the same time the hemisphere and the vertebre into\r\ntwo halves, thus forming the quadrilateral; it is clear that this\r\nquadrilateral to which the Atlantic is adjacent, is but the half of the\r\nvertebre; while at the same time the inhabited earth, which is an island\r\nin this, and shaped like a chlamys or soldier’s cloak, occupies less\r\nthan the half of the quadrilateral. This is evident from geometry,\r\nalso[710] from the extent of the surrounding sea, which covers the\r\nextremities of the continents on either side, compressing them into a\r\nsmaller figure, and thirdly, by the greatest length and breadth [of the\r\nearth itself]. The length being 70,000 stadia, enclosed almost entirely\r\nby a sea, impossible to navigate owing to its wildness and vast extent,\r\nand the breadth 30,000 stadia, bounded by regions rendered uninhabitable\r\non account either of their intense heat or cold. That portion of the\r\nquadrilateral which is unfitted for habitation on account of the heat,\r\ncontains in breadth 8800 stadia, and in its greatest length 126,000\r\nstadia, which is equal to one half of the equator, and larger than one\r\nhalf the inhabited earth; and what is left is still more.\r\n\r\n7. These calculations are nearly synonymous with those furnished by\r\nHipparchus, who tells us, that supposing the size of the globe as stated\r\nby Eratosthenes to be correct, we can then subtract from it the extent\r\nof the inhabited earth, since in noting the celestial appearances [as\r\nthey are seen] in different countries, it is not of much importance\r\nwhether we make use of this measure, or that furnished by later writers.\r\nNow as the whole circle of the equator according to Eratosthenes\r\ncontains 252,000 stadia, the quarter of this would be 63,000, that is,\r\nthe space from the equator to the pole contains fifteen of the sixty\r\ndivisions[711] into which the equator itself is divided. There are four\r\n[divisions] between the equator and the summer tropic or parallel\r\npassing through Syene. The distances for each locality are calculated by\r\nthe astronomical observations.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Syene is under the tropic, from the fact that during\r\nthe summer solstice the gnomon at mid-day casts no shadow there. As for\r\nthe meridian of Syene, it follows very nearly the course of the Nile\r\nfrom Meroe to Alexandria, a distance of about 10,000 stadia. Syene\r\nitself is situated about midway between these places, consequently from\r\nthence to Meroe is a distance of 5000 stadia. Advancing 3000 stadia\r\nsouthward in a right line, we come to lands unfitted for habitation on\r\naccount of the heat. Consequently the parallel which bounds these\r\nplaces, and which is the same as that of the Cinnamon Country, is to be\r\nregarded as the boundary and commencement of the habitable earth on the\r\nsouth. If, then, 3000 stadia be added to the 5000 between Syene and\r\nMeroe, there will be altogether 8000 stadia [from Syene] to the\r\n[southern] extremity of the habitable earth. But from Syene to the\r\nequator there are 16,800 stadia, (for such is the amount of the\r\nfour-sixtieths, each sixtieth being equivalent to 4200 stadia,) and\r\nconsequently from the [southern] boundaries of the habitable earth to\r\nthe equator there are 8800 stadia, and from Alexandria 21,800.[712]\r\nAgain, every one is agreed that the voyage from Alexandria to Rhodes,\r\nand thence by Caria and Ionia to the Troad, Byzantium, and the Dnieper,\r\nis in a straight line with the course of the Nile.[713]\r\n\r\nTaking therefore these distances, which have been ascertained by\r\nvoyages, we have only to find out how far beyond the Dnieper the land is\r\nhabitable, (being careful always to continue in the same straight line,)\r\nand we shall arrive at a knowledge of the northern boundaries of our\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Dnieper dwell the Roxolani,[714] the last of the Scythians\r\nwith which we are acquainted; they are nevertheless more south than the\r\nfarthest nations[715] we know of beyond Britain. Beyond these Roxolani\r\nthe country is uninhabitable on account of the severity of the climate.\r\nThe Sauromatæ[716] who live around the Mæotis, and the other\r\nScythians[717] as far as the Scythians of the East, dwell farther south.\r\n\r\n8. It is true that Pytheas of Marseilles affirms that the farthest\r\ncountry north of the British islands is Thule; for which place he says\r\nthe summer tropic and the arctic circle is all one. But he records no\r\nother particulars concerning it; [he does not say] whether Thule is an\r\nisland, or whether it continues habitable up to the point where the\r\nsummer tropic becomes one with the arctic circle.[718] For myself, I\r\nfancy that the northern boundaries of the habitable earth are greatly\r\nsouth of this. Modern writers tell us of nothing beyond Ierne, which\r\nlies just north of Britain, where the people live miserably and like\r\nsavages on account of the severity of the cold. It is here in my opinion\r\nthe bounds of the habitable earth ought to be fixed.\r\n\r\nIf on the one hand the parallels of Byzantium and Marseilles are the\r\nsame, as Hipparchus asserts on the faith of Pytheas, (for he[719] says\r\nthat at Byzantium the gnomon indicates the same amount of shadow as\r\nPytheas gives for Marseilles,) and at the same time the parallel of the\r\nDnieper is distant from Byzantium about 3800 stadia, it follows, if we\r\ntake into consideration the distance between Marseilles and Britain,\r\nthat the circle which passes over the Dnieper traverses Britain as\r\nwell.[720] But the truth is that Pytheas, who so frequently misleads\r\npeople, deceives in this instance too.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that a line drawn from the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nand passing over the Strait [of Messina], Athens, and Rhodes, would lie\r\nunder the same parallel of latitude.[721] It is likewise admitted, that\r\nthe line in passing from the Pillars to the Strait of Sicily divides the\r\nMediterranean through the midst.[722] Navigators tell us that the\r\ngreatest distance from Keltica to Libya, starting from the bottom of the\r\nGalatic Bay, is 5000 stadia, and that this is likewise the greatest\r\nbreadth of the Mediterranean. Consequently from the said line to the\r\nbottom of the bay is 2500 stadia; but to Marseilles the distance is\r\nrather less, in consequence of that city being more to the south than\r\nthe bottom of the bay.[723] But since from Rhodes to Byzantium is about\r\n4900[724] stadia, it follows that Byzantium must be far north of\r\nMarseilles.[725] The distance from this latter city to Britain is about\r\nthe same as from Byzantium to the Dnieper.[726] How far it may be from\r\nBritain to the island of Ierne is not known. As to whether beyond it\r\nthere may still be habitable lands, it is not our business to inquire,\r\nas we stated before. It is sufficient for our science to determine this\r\nin the same manner that we did the southern boundaries. We there fixed\r\nthe bounds of the habitable earth at 3000 stadia south of Meroe (not\r\nthat these were its exact limits, but because they were sufficiently\r\nnear); so in this instance they should be placed about the same number\r\nof stadia north of Britain, certainly not more than 4000.[727]\r\n\r\nIt would not serve any political purpose to be well acquainted with\r\nthese distant places and the people who inhabit them; especially if they\r\nare islands whose inhabitants can neither injure us, nor yet benefit us\r\nby their commerce. The Romans might easily have conquered Britain, but\r\nthey did not care to do so, as they perceived there was nothing to fear\r\nfrom the inhabitants, (they not being powerful enough to attack us,) and\r\nthat they would gain nothing by occupying the land. Even now it appears\r\nthat we gain more by the customs they pay, than we could raise by\r\ntribute, after deducting the wages of the soldiers necessary for\r\nguarding the island and exacting the taxes. And the other islands\r\nadjacent to this would be still more unproductive.\r\n\r\n9. If, then, to the distance between Rhodes and the Dnieper be added\r\nfour thousand stadia north of the latter place, the whole would come to\r\n12,700 stadia; and since from Rhodes to the southern limit of the\r\nhabitable earth there are 16,600 stadia, its total breadth from north to\r\nsouth would be under 30,000 stadia.[728] Its length from west to east is\r\nstated at 70,000 stadia, the distance being measured from the\r\nextremities of Iberia to those of India, partly over the land and partly\r\nacross the sea. That this length is contained within the quadrilateral\r\naforesaid, is proved by the proportion borne by these parallels to the\r\nequator. Thus the length of the habitable earth is above twice its\r\nbreadth. It has been compared in figure to a chlamys, or soldier’s\r\ncloak, because if every part be carefully examined, it will be found\r\nthat its breadth is greatly diminished towards the extremities,\r\nespecially in the west.\r\n\r\n10. We have now been tracing upon a spherical surface the region which\r\nwe state to be occupied by the habitable earth; and whoever would\r\nrepresent the real earth as near as possible by artificial means, should\r\nmake a globe like that of Crates, and upon this describe the\r\nquadrilateral within which his chart of geography is to be placed. For\r\nthis purpose, however, a large globe is necessary, since the section\r\nmentioned, though but a very small portion of the entire sphere, must be\r\ncapable of properly containing all the regions of the habitable earth,\r\nand presenting an accurate view of them to all those who wish to consult\r\nit. Any one who is able will certainly do well to obtain such a globe.\r\nBut it should have a diameter of not less than ten feet: those who\r\ncannot obtain a globe of this size, or one nearly as large, had better\r\ndraw their chart on a plane-surface, of not less than seven feet. Draw\r\nstraight lines, some parallel, for the parallels [of latitude], and\r\nothers at right angles to these; we may easily imagine how the eye can\r\ntransfer the figure and extent [of these lines] from a plane-surface to\r\none that is spherical. What we have just observed of the circles in\r\ngeneral, may be said with equal truth touching the oblique circles. On\r\nthe globe it is true that the meridians of each country passing the pole\r\nhave a tendency to unite in a single point, nevertheless on the\r\nplane-surface of the map, there would be no advantage if the right lines\r\nalone which should represent the meridians were drawn slightly to\r\nconverge. The necessity for such a proceeding would scarcely ever be\r\nreally felt. Even on our globe itself[729] the tendency of those\r\nmeridians (which are transferred to the map as right lines) to converge\r\nis not much, nor any thing near so obvious as their circular tendency.\r\n\r\n11. In what follows we shall suppose the chart drawn on a plane-surface;\r\nand our descriptions shall consist of what we ourselves have observed in\r\nour travels by land and sea, and of what we conceive to be credible in\r\nthe statements and writings of others. For ourselves, in a westerly\r\ndirection we have travelled from Armenia to that part of Tyrrhenia[730]\r\nwhich is over against Sardinia; and southward, from the Euxine to the\r\nfrontiers of Ethiopia.[731] Of all the writers on Geography, not one can\r\nbe mentioned who has travelled over a wider extent of the countries\r\ndescribed than we have. Some may have gone farther to the west, but then\r\nthey have never been so far east as we have; again, others may have been\r\nfarther east, but not so far west; and the same with respect to north\r\nand south. However, in the main, both we and they have availed ourselves\r\nof the reports of others, from which to describe the form, the size, and\r\nthe other peculiarities of the country, what they are and how many, in\r\nthe same way that the mind forms its conceptions from the information of\r\nthe senses. The figure, colour, and size of an apple, its scent, feel to\r\nthe touch, and its flavour, are particulars communicated by the senses,\r\nfrom which the mind forms its conception of an apple. So in large\r\nfigures, the senses observe the various parts, while the mind combines\r\ninto one conception what is thus seen. And in like manner, men eager\r\nafter knowledge, trusting to those who have been to various places, and\r\nto [the descriptions of] travellers in this or that country, gather into\r\none sketch a view of the whole habitable earth.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the generals perform every thing, nevertheless, they\r\nare not present every where, but most of their success depends on\r\nothers, since they are obliged to trust to messengers, and issue their\r\ncommands in accordance with the reports of others. To pretend that those\r\nonly can know who have themselves seen, is to deprive hearing of all\r\nconfidence, which, after all, is a better servant of knowledge than\r\nsight itself.\r\n\r\n12. Writers of the present day can describe with more certainty [than\r\nformerly] the Britons, the Germans, and the dwellers on either side of\r\nthe Danube, the Getæ,[732] the Tyrigetæ, the Bastarnæ,[733] the tribes\r\ndwelling by the Caucasus, such as the Albanians and Iberians.[734] We\r\nare besides possessed of a description of Hyrcania[735] and Bactriana in\r\nthe Histories of Parthia written by such men as Apollodorus of\r\nArtemita,[736] who have detailed the boundaries [of those countries]\r\nwith greater accuracy than other geographers.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of a Roman army into Arabia Felix under the command of my\r\nfriend and companion Ælius Gallus,[737] and the traffic of the\r\nAlexandrian merchants whose vessels pass up the Nile and Arabian\r\nGulf[738] to India, have rendered us much better acquainted with these\r\ncountries than our predecessors were. I was with Gallus at the time he\r\nwas prefect of Egypt, and accompanied him as far as Syene and the\r\nfrontiers of Ethiopia, and I found that about one hundred and twenty\r\nships sail from Myos-hormos[739] to India, although, in the time of the\r\nPtolemies, scarcely any one would venture on this voyage and the\r\ncommerce with the Indies.\r\n\r\n13. Our first and most imperative duty[740] then, both in respect to\r\nscience and to the necessities of the man of business, is to undertake\r\nto lay down the projection of the different countries on the chart in as\r\nclear a style as possible, and to signify at the same time the relation\r\nand proportion they bear to the whole earth. For such is the\r\ngeographer’s peculiar province. It belongs to another science to give an\r\nexact description of the whole earth, and of the entire vertebre of\r\neither zone, and as to whether the vertebre in the opposite quarter of\r\nthe earth is inhabited. That such is the case is most probable, but not\r\nthat it is inhabited by the same race of men as dwell with us. And it\r\nmust therefore be regarded as another habitable earth. We however have\r\nonly to describe our own.\r\n\r\n14. In its figure the habitable earth resembles a chlamys, or soldier’s\r\ncloak, the greatest breadth of which would be indicated by a line drawn\r\nin the direction of the Nile, commencing from the parallel of the\r\nCinnamon Country, and the Island of the Egyptian Exiles, and terminating\r\nat the parallel of Ierna; and its length by a line drawn from the west\r\nat right angles to the former, passing by the Pillars of Hercules and\r\nthe Strait of Sicily to Rhodes and the Gulf of Issus,[741] then\r\nproceeding along the chain of the Taurus, which divides Asia, and\r\nterminating in the Eastern Ocean,[742] between India and the Scythians\r\ndwelling beyond Bactriana.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore fancy to ourselves a parallelogram, and within it a\r\nchlamys-shaped figure, described in such a manner that the length of the\r\none figure may correspond to the length and size of the other, and\r\nlikewise breadth to breadth. The habitable earth will therefore be\r\nrepresented by this kind of chlamys. We have before said that its\r\nbreadth is marked out by parallels bounding its sides, and separating on\r\neither side the portions that are habitable from those that are not. On\r\nthe north [these parallels] pass over Ierna,[743] and on the side of the\r\ntorrid zone over the Cinnamon Country. These lines being produced east\r\nand west to the opposite extremities of the habitable earth, form, when\r\njoined by the perpendiculars falling from their extremities, a kind of\r\nparallelogram. That within this the habitable earth is contained is\r\nevident, since neither its greatest breadth nor length project beyond.\r\nThat in configuration it resembles a chlamys is also clear, from the\r\nfact that at either end of its length, the extremities taper to a\r\npoint.[744] Owing to the encroachments of the sea, it also loses\r\nsomething in breadth. This we know from those who have sailed round its\r\neastern and western points. They inform us that the island called\r\nTaprobana[745] is much to the south of India, but that it is\r\nnevertheless inhabited, and is situated opposite to the island of the\r\nEgyptians and the Cinnamon Country, as the temperature of their\r\natmospheres is similar. On the other side the country about the\r\nembouchure of the Hyrcanian Sea[746] is farther north than the farthest\r\nScythians who dwell beyond India, and Ierna still more so. It is\r\nlikewise stated of the country beyond the Pillars of Hercules, that the\r\nmost western point of the habitable earth is the promontory of the\r\nIberians named the Sacred Promontory.[747] It lies nearly in a line with\r\nGades, the Pillars of Hercules, the Strait of Sicily, and Rhodes;[748]\r\nfor they say that the horologes accord, as also the periodical winds,\r\nand the duration of the longest nights and days, which consist of\r\nfourteen and a half equinoctial hours. From the coast of Gades and\r\nIberia ... is said to have been formerly observed.[749]\r\n\r\nPosidonius relates, that from the top of a high house in a town about\r\n400 stadia distant from the places mentioned, he perceived a star which\r\nhe believed to be Canopus, both in consequence of the testimony of those\r\nwho having proceeded a little to the south of Iberia affirmed that they\r\ncould perceive it, and also of the tradition preserved at Cnidus; for\r\nthe observatory of Eudoxus, from whence he is reported to have viewed\r\nCanopus, is not much higher than these houses; and Cnidus is under the\r\nsame parallel as Rhodes, which is likewise that of Gades and its\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\n15. Sailing thence, Libya lies to the south. Its most western portions\r\nproject a little beyond Gades; it afterwards forms a narrow promontory\r\nreceding towards the east and south, and becoming slightly broader, till\r\nit touches upon the western Ethiopians, who are the last[750] of the\r\nnations situated below Carthage, and adjoin the parallel of the Cinnamon\r\nCountry. They, on the contrary, who sail from the Sacred\r\nPromontory,[751] towards the Artabri,[752] journey northwards, having\r\nLusitania[753] on the right hand. The remaining portion forms an obtuse\r\nangle towards the east as far as the extremities of the Pyrenees which\r\nterminate at the ocean. Northward and opposite to this are the western\r\ncoasts of Britain. Northward and opposite to the Artabri are the islands\r\ndenominated Cassiterides,[754] situated in the high seas, but under\r\nnearly the same latitude as Britain. From this it appears to what a\r\ndegree the extremities of the habitable earth are narrowed by the\r\nsurrounding sea.\r\n\r\n16. Such being the configuration of the whole earth, it will be\r\nconvenient to take two straight lines, cutting each other at right\r\nangles, and running the one through its greatest length, and the other\r\nthrough its breadth. The former of these lines will represent one of the\r\nparallels, and the latter one of the meridians.[755] Afterwards we must\r\nimagine other lines parallel to either of these respectively, and\r\ndividing both the land and sea with which we are acquainted. By this\r\nmeans the form of the habitable earth will appear more clearly to be\r\nsuch as we have described it; likewise the extent of the various lines,\r\nwhether traced through its length or breadth, and the latitudes [of\r\nplaces], will also be more clearly distinguished, whether north or\r\nsouth, as also [the longitudes] whether east or west. However, these\r\nright lines should be drawn through places that are known. Two have\r\nalready been thus fixed upon, I mean the two middle [lines] running\r\nthrough its length and breadth, which have been already explained, and\r\nby means of these the others may easily be determined. These lines will\r\nserve us as marks to distinguish countries situated under the same\r\nparallel, and otherwise to determine different positions both in respect\r\nto the other portions of the earth, and also of the celestial\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n17. The ocean it is which principally divides the earth into various\r\ncountries, and moulds its form. It creates bays, seas, straits,\r\nisthmuses, peninsulas, and capes; while rivers and mountains serve to\r\nthe same purpose. It is by these means that continents, nations, and the\r\nposition of cities are capable of being clearly distinguished, together\r\nwith those various other details of which a chorographical chart is\r\nfull. Amongst these latter are the multitude of islands scattered\r\nthroughout the seas, and along every coast; each of them distinguished\r\nby some good or bad quality, by certain advantages or disadvantages, due\r\neither to nature or to art.\r\n\r\nThe natural advantages [of a place] should always be mentioned, since\r\nthey are permanent. Advantages which are adventitious are liable to\r\nchange, although the majority of those which have continued for any\r\nlength of time should not be passed over, nor even those which, although\r\nbut recent, have yet acquired some note and celebrity. For those which\r\ncontinue, come to be regarded by posterity not as works of art, but as\r\nthe natural advantages of the place; these therefore it is evident we\r\nmust notice. True it is, that to many a city we may apply the reflection\r\nof Demosthenes[756] on Olynthus and its neighbouring towns: “So\r\ncompletely have they vanished, that no one who should now visit their\r\nsites could say that they had ever been inhabited!”\r\n\r\nStill we are gratified by visiting these and similar localities, being\r\ndesirous of beholding the traces of such celebrated places, and the\r\ntombs of famous men. In like manner we should record laws and forms of\r\ngovernment no longer in existence, since these are serviceable to have\r\nin mind, equally with the remembrance of actions, whether for the sake\r\nof imitating or avoiding the like.\r\n\r\n18. Continuing our former sketch, we now state that the earth which we\r\ninhabit contains numerous gulfs, formed by the exterior sea or ocean\r\nwhich surrounds it. Of these there are four principal. The northern,\r\ncalled the Caspian, by others designated the Hyrcanian Sea, the Persian\r\nand Arabian Gulfs, formed by the [Southern] Sea, the one being nearly\r\nopposite to the Caspian, the other to the Euxine; the fourth, which in\r\nsize is much more considerable than the others, is called the Internal\r\nand Our Sea.[757] It commences in the west at the Strait of the Pillars\r\nof Hercules, and continues in an easterly direction, but with varying\r\nbreadth. Farther in, it becomes divided, and terminates in two gulfs;\r\nthat on the left being called the Euxine Sea, while the other consists\r\nof the seas of Egypt, Pamphylia, and Issus. All these gulfs formed by\r\nthe exterior sea, have a narrow entrance; those of the Arabian Gulf,\r\nhowever, and the Pillars of Hercules are smaller than the rest.[758] The\r\nland which surrounds these, as before remarked, consists of three\r\ndivisions. Of these, the configuration of Europe is the most irregular.\r\nLibya, on the contrary, is the most regular; while Asia holds a middle\r\nplace between the two. In all of these continents, the regularity or\r\nirregularity of form relates merely to the interior coasts; the\r\nexterior, with the exception of the gulfs before mentioned, is\r\nunindented, and, as I have stated, resembles a chlamys in its form; any\r\nslight differences being of course overlooked, as in large matters what\r\nis insignificant passes for nothing. Since in geographical descriptions\r\nwe not only aim at portraying the configuration and extent of various\r\nplaces, but also their common boundaries, we will remark here, as we\r\nhave done before, that the coasts of the Internal Sea[759] present a\r\ngreater variety in their appearance than those of the Exterior [Ocean];\r\nthe former is also much better known, its climate is more temperate, and\r\nmore civilized cities and nations are here than there. We are also\r\nanxious to be informed where the form of government, the arts, and\r\nwhatever else ministers to intelligence, produce the greatest results.\r\nInterest will always lead us to where the relations of commerce and\r\nsociety are most easily established, and these are advantages to be\r\nfound where government is administered, or rather where it is well\r\nadministered. In each of these particulars, as before remarked, Our\r\nSea[760] possesses great advantages, and here therefore we will begin\r\nour description.\r\n\r\n19. This gulf,[761] as before stated, commences at the Strait of the\r\nPillars; this at its narrowest part is said to be 70 stadia. Having\r\nsailed down a distance of 120 stadia, the shores widen considerably,\r\nespecially to the left, and you behold a vast sea, bounded on the right\r\nby the shore of Libya as far as Carthage, and on the opposite side by\r\nthose of Iberia and Keltica as far as Narbonne and Marseilles, thence by\r\nthe Ligurian,[762] and finally by the Italian coast to the Strait of\r\nSicily. The eastern side of this sea is formed by Sicily and the straits\r\non either side of it. That next Italy being 7 stadia [in breadth], and\r\nthat next Carthage 1500 stadia. The line drawn from the Pillars to the\r\nlesser strait of 7 stadia, forms part of the line to Rhodes and the\r\nTaurus, and intersects the sea under discussion about its middle; this\r\nline is said to be 12,000 stadia, which is accordingly the length of the\r\nsea. Its greatest breadth is about 5000 stadia, and extends from the\r\nGalatic Gulf, between Marseilles and Narbonne, to the opposite coast of\r\nLibya.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the sea which washes Libya is called the Libyan Sea;\r\nthat surrounding the land opposite is designated by the respective names\r\nof the Iberian, the Ligurian,[763] and the Sardinian Seas, while the\r\nremaining portion as far as Sicily is named the Tyrrhenian Sea.[764] All\r\nalong the coast between the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Seas, there are\r\nnumerous islands, the largest of which are Sardinia and Cyrnus,[765]\r\nalways excepting Sicily, which is larger and more fertile than any of\r\nour islands. The remainder are much smaller. Of this number are, in the\r\nhigh sea, Pandataria[766] and Pontia,[767] and close to the shore\r\nÆthalia,[768] Planasia,[769] Pithecussa,[770] Prochyta,[771]\r\nCapriæ,[772] Leucosia,[773] and many others. On the other[774] side of\r\nthe Ligurian shore, and along the rest of the coast as far as the\r\nPillars, there are but few islands; the Gymnasiæ[775] and Ebusus[776]\r\nare of this number. There are likewise but few islands along the coasts\r\nof Libya and Sicily. We may mention however Cossura,[777] Ægimurus,[778]\r\nand the Lipari Islands, likewise called the Islands of Æolus.\r\n\r\n20. After Sicily and the straits on either side of it,[779] there are\r\nother seas, for instance, that opposite the Syrtes and the\r\nCyrenaic,[780] the Syrtes themselves, and the sea formerly called the\r\nAusonian, but which, as it flows into and forms part of the Sea of\r\nSicily, is now included under the latter name. The sea opposite to the\r\nSyrtes and the Cyrenaic is called the Libyan Sea; it extends as far as\r\nthe Sea of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Lesser Syrtes[781] is about 1600 stadia in circumference. On either\r\nside of its mouth lie the islands of Meninx[782] and Kerkina.[783] The\r\nGreater Syrtes[784] is (according to Eratosthenes) 5000 stadia in\r\ncircuit, and in depth 1800, from the Hesperides[785] to Automala,[786]\r\nand the frontier which separates the Cyrenaic from the rest of Libya.\r\nAccording to others, its circumference is only 4000 stadia, its depth\r\n1500 stadia, and the breadth at its mouth the same.\r\n\r\nThe Sea of Sicily washes Italy, from the Strait of Rhegium[787] to\r\nLocris,[788] and also the eastern coast of Sicily from Messene[789] to\r\nSyracuse[790] and Pachynus.[791] On the eastern side it reaches to the\r\npromontories of Crete, surrounds the greater part of Peloponnesus, and\r\nfills the Gulf of Corinth.[792] On the north it advances to the Iapygian\r\nPromontory,[793] the mouth of the Ionian Gulf,[794] the southern parts\r\nof Epirus,[795] as far as the Ambracic Gulf,[796] and the continuation\r\nof the coast which forms the Corinthian Gulf, near the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nThe Ionian Gulf forms part of what we now call the Adriatic.[797]\r\nIllyria forms its right side, and Italy as far as the recess where\r\nAquileia is situated, the left.\r\n\r\nThe Adriatic stretches north and west; it is long and narrow, being in\r\nlength about 6000 stadia, and its greatest breadth 1200. There are many\r\nislands situated here opposite the coasts of Illyria, such as the\r\nAbsyrtides,[798] Cyrictica,[799] and the Libyrnides,[800] also\r\nIssa,[801] Tragurium,[802] the Black Corcyra,[803] and Pharos.[804]\r\nOpposite to Italy are the Islands of Diomede.[805] The Sea of Sicily is\r\nsaid to be 4500 stadia from Pachynus to Crete, and the same distance to\r\nTænarus in Laconia.[806] From the extremities of Iapygia to the bottom\r\nof the Gulf of Corinth the distance is less than 3000 stadia, while from\r\nIapygia to Libya it is more than 4000. In this sea are the Islands of\r\nCorcyra[807] and Sybota,[808] opposite the coasts of Epirus; and beyond\r\nthese, opposite the Gulf of Corinth, Cephallenia,[809] Ithaca,\r\nZacynth,[810] and the Echinades.[811]\r\n\r\n21. Next to the Sea of Sicily, are the Cretan, Saronic,[812] and Myrtoan\r\nSeas, comprised between Crete, Argia,[813] and Attica.[814] Their\r\ngreatest breadth, measured from Attica, is 1200 stadia, and their length\r\nnot quite double the distance. Within are included the Islands of\r\nCythera,[815] Calauria,[816] Ægina,[817] Salamis,[818] and certain of\r\nthe Cyclades.[819] Adjacent to these are the Ægæan Sea,[820] the Gulf of\r\nMelas,[821] the Hellespont,[822] the Icarian and Carpathian Seas,[823]\r\nas far as Rhodes, Crete, Cnidus, and the commencement of Asia. [In these\r\nseas] are the Cyclades, the Sporades, and the islands opposite Caria,\r\nIonia, and Æolia, as far as the Troad, namely, Cos,[824] Samos,[825]\r\nChios,[826] Lesbos,[827] and Tenedos;[828] likewise on the Grecian side\r\nas far as Macedonia and the borders of Thrace, Eubœa,[829] Scyros,[830]\r\nPeparethus,[831] Lemnos,[832] Thasos,[833] Imbros,[834]\r\nSamothracia,[835] and numerous others, of which it is our intention to\r\nspeak in detail. The length of this sea is about 4000 stadia, or rather\r\nmore,[836] its breadth about 2000.[837] It is surrounded by the coast\r\nof Asia above mentioned, and by those of Greece from Sunium[838]\r\nnorthwards to the Thermaic Gulf[839] and the Gulfs of Macedonia,[840]\r\nand as far as the Thracian Chersonesus.[841]\r\n\r\n22. Here too is the strait, seven stadia in length, which is between\r\nSestos[842] and Abydos,[843] and through which the Ægæan and Hellespont\r\ncommunicate with another sea to the north, named the Propontis,[844] and\r\nthis again with another called the Euxine. This latter is, so to speak,\r\na double sea, for towards its middle are two projecting promontories,\r\none to the north, on the side of Europe, and the other opposite from the\r\ncoast of Asia, which leave only a narrow passage between them, and thus\r\nform two great seas. The European promontory is named Criu-metopon;[845]\r\nthat of Asia, Carambis.[846] They are distant from each other about 2500\r\nstadia.[847] The length of the western portion of this sea[848] from\r\nByzantium to the outlets of the Dnieper is 3800 stadia, its breadth\r\n2000. Here is situated the Island of Leuca.[849] The eastern portion is\r\noblong and terminates in the narrow recess in which Dioscurias is\r\nsituated. In length it is 5000 stadia, or rather more, and in breadth\r\nabout 3000. The entire circumference of the Euxine is about 25,000\r\nstadia. Some have compared the shape of its circumference to a Scythian\r\nbow when bent, the string representing the southern portions of the\r\nEuxine, (viz. the coast, from its mouth to the recess in which\r\nDioscurias is situated; for, with the exception of Carambis, the\r\nsinuosities of the shore are but trifling, so that it may be justly\r\ncompared to a straight line,) and the remainder [of the circumference\r\nrepresenting] the wood of the bow with its double curve, the uppermost\r\nvery much rounded, the lower more in a straight line. So this sea forms\r\ntwo gulfs, the western much more rounded than the other.\r\n\r\n23. To the north of the eastern Gulf of the Pontus, is the Lake Mæotis,\r\nwhose perimeter is 9000 stadia or rather more. It communicates with the\r\nEuxine by means of the Cimmerian Bosphorus,[850] and the Euxine with the\r\nPropontis[851] by the Thracian Bosphorus, for such is the name given to\r\nthe Strait of Byzantium, which is four stadia in breadth. The length of\r\nthe Propontis from the Troad to Byzantium is stated to be 1500 stadia.\r\nIts breadth is about the same. It is in this sea that the Island of the\r\nCyziceni[852] is situated, with the other islands around it.\r\n\r\n24. Such and so great is the extent of the Ægæan Sea towards the\r\nnorth.[853] Again, starting from Rhodes, the [Mediterranean] forms the\r\nseas of Egypt, Pamphylia, and Issus, extending in an easterly direction\r\nfrom Cilicia to Issus, a distance of 5000 stadia, along the coasts of\r\nLycia, Pamphylia, and the whole of Cilicia. From thence Syria, Phœnicia,\r\nand Egypt surround the sea to the south and west as far as Alexandria.\r\nThe Island of Cyprus is situated in the Gulfs of Issus and Pamphylia,\r\nclose to the Sea of Egypt. The passage between Rhodes and Alexandria\r\nfrom north [to south] is about 4000 stadia;[854] sailing round the\r\ncoasts it is double this distance. Eratosthenes informs us that,\r\nalthough the above is the distance according to some mariners, others\r\navow distinctly that it amounts to 5000 stadia; while he himself, from\r\nobservations of the shadows indicated by the gnomon, calculates it at\r\n3750.\r\n\r\nThat part of the Mediterranean Sea which washes the coasts of Cilicia\r\nand Pamphylia together with the right side of the Euxine, the Propontis,\r\nand the sea-coast beyond this as far as Pamphylia, form a kind of\r\nextensive Chersonesus, the isthmus of which is also large, and reaches\r\nfrom the sea near Tarsus[855] to the city of Amisus,[856] and thence to\r\nthe Themiscyran[857] plain of the Amazons. In fact the whole region\r\nwithin this line as far as Caria and Ionia, and the nations dwelling on\r\nthis side the Halys,[858] is entirely surrounded by the Ægæan and the\r\naforementioned parts of the Mediterranean and Euxine Seas.[859] This is\r\nwhat we call Asia properly,[860] although the whole continent bears the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\n25. To speak shortly, the southernmost point of Our Sea is the recess of\r\nthe Greater Syrtes;[861] next to this Alexandria in Egypt, and the\r\nmouths of the Nile; while the most northerly is the mouth of the\r\nDnieper, or if the Mæotis be considered to belong to the Euxine, (and it\r\ncertainly does appear to form a part of it,) the mouth of the Don. The\r\nStrait at the Pillars is the most westerly point, and the most easterly\r\nis the said recess, in which Dioscurias[862] is situated; and not, as\r\nEratosthenes falsely states, the Gulf of Issus,[863] which is under the\r\nsame meridian as Amisus[864] and Themiscyra, and, if you will have it\r\nso, Sidene as far as Pharnacia.[865] Proceeding thence in an easterly\r\ndirection to Dioscurias, the distance by sea is above 3000 stadia, as\r\nwill be seen more plainly in my detailed account of those countries.\r\nSuch then is the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n26. We must now describe the countries which surround it; and here we\r\nwill begin from the same point, whence we commenced our description of\r\nthe sea itself.\r\n\r\nEntering the Strait at the Pillars, Libya, as far as the river Nile, is\r\non the right hand, and to the left, on the other side of the Strait, is\r\nEurope, as far as the Don. Asia bounds both these continents. We will\r\ncommence with Europe, both because its figure is more varied, and also\r\nbecause it is the quarter most favourable to the mental and social\r\nennoblement of man, and produces a greater portion of comforts than the\r\nother continents.\r\n\r\nNow the whole of Europe is habitable with the exception of a small part,\r\nwhich cannot be dwelt in, on account of the severity of the cold, and\r\nwhich borders on the Hamaxœci,[866] who dwell by the Don, Mæotis, and\r\nDnieper. The wintry and mountainous parts of the habitable earth would\r\nseem to afford by nature but a miserable means of existence;\r\nnevertheless, by good management, places scarcely inhabited by any but\r\nrobbers, may be got into condition. Thus the Greeks, though dwelling\r\namidst rocks and mountains, live in comfort, owing to their economy in\r\ngovernment and the arts, and all the other appliances of life. Thus too\r\nthe Romans, after subduing numerous nations who were leading a savage\r\nlife, either induced by the rockiness of their countries, or want of\r\nports, or severity of the cold, or for other reasons scarcely habitable,\r\nhave taught the arts of commerce to many who were formerly in total\r\nignorance, and spread civilization amongst the most savage. Where the\r\nclimate is equable and mild, nature herself does much towards the\r\nproduction of these advantages. As in such favoured regions every thing\r\ninclines to peace, so those which are sterile generate bravery and a\r\ndisposition to war. These two races receive mutual advantages from each\r\nother, the one aiding by their arms, the other by their husbandry, arts,\r\nand institutions. Harm must result to both when failing to act in\r\nconcert, but the advantage will lie on the side of those accustomed to\r\narms, except in instances where they are overpowered by multitudes. This\r\ncontinent is very much favoured in this respect, being interspersed\r\nwith plains and mountains, so that every where the foundations of\r\nhusbandry, civilization, and hardihood lie side by side. The number of\r\nthose who cultivate the arts of peace, is, however, the most numerous,\r\nwhich preponderance over the whole is mainly due to the influence of the\r\ngovernment, first of the Greeks, and afterwards of the Macedonians and\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nEurope has thus within itself resources both for war [and peace]. It is\r\namply supplied with warriors, and also with men fitted for the labours\r\nof agriculture, and the life of the towns. It is likewise distinguished\r\nfor producing in perfection those fruits of the earth necessary to life,\r\nand all the useful metals. Perfumes and precious stones must be imported\r\nfrom abroad, but as far as the comfort of life is concerned, the want or\r\nthe possession of these can make no difference. The country likewise\r\nabounds in cattle, while of wild beasts the number is but small. Such is\r\nthe general nature of this continent.\r\n\r\n27. We will now describe separately the various countries into which it\r\nis divided. The first of these on the west is Iberia, which resembles\r\nthe hide of an ox [spread out]; the eastern portions, which correspond\r\nto the neck, adjoining the neighbouring country of Gaul. The two\r\ncountries are divided on this side by the chain of mountains called the\r\nPyrenees; on all its other sides it is surrounded by sea; on the south,\r\nas far as the Pillars, by Our Sea; and thence to the northern extremity\r\nof the Pyrenees by the Atlantic. The greatest length of this country is\r\nabout 6000 stadia, its breadth 5000.[867]\r\n\r\n28. East of this is Keltica, which extends as far as the Rhine. Its\r\nnorthern side is washed by the entire of the British Channel, for this\r\nisland lies opposite and parallel to it throughout, extending as much as\r\n5000 stadia in length. Its eastern side is bounded by the river Rhine,\r\nwhose stream runs parallel with the Pyrenees; and its southern side\r\ncommencing from the Rhine, [is bounded] partly by the Alps, and partly\r\nby Our Sea; where what is called the Galatic Gulf[868] runs in, and on\r\nthis are situated the far-famed cities of Marseilles and Narbonne. Right\r\nopposite to the Gulf on the other side of the land, lies another Gulf,\r\ncalled by the same name, Galatic,[869] looking towards the north and\r\nBritain. It is here that the breadth of Keltica is the narrowest, being\r\ncontracted into an isthmus less than 3000 stadia, but more than 2000.\r\nWithin this region there is a mountain ridge, named Mount Cemmenus,[870]\r\nwhich runs nearly at right angles to the Pyrenees, and terminates in the\r\ncentral plains of Keltica.[871] The Alps, which are a very lofty range\r\nof mountains, form a curved line, the convex side of which is turned\r\ntowards the plains of Keltica, mentioned before, and Mount Cemmenus, and\r\nthe concave towards Liguria[872] and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Alps are inhabited by numerous nations, but all Keltic with the\r\nexception of the Ligurians, and these, though of a different race,\r\nclosely resemble them in their manner of life. They inhabit that portion\r\nof the Alps which is next the Apennines, and also a part of the\r\nApennines themselves. This latter mountain ridge traverses the whole\r\nlength of Italy from north to south, and terminates at the Strait of\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\n29. The first parts of Italy are the plains situated under the Alps, as\r\nfar as the recess of the Adriatic and the neighbouring places.[873] The\r\nparts beyond form a narrow and long slip, resembling a peninsula,\r\ntraversed, as I have said, throughout its length by the Apennines; its\r\nlength is 7000 stadia, but its breadth is very unequal. The seas which\r\nform the peninsula of Italy are, the Tyrrhenian, which commences from\r\nthe Ligurian, the Ausonian, and the Adriatic.[874]\r\n\r\n30. After Italy and Keltica, the remainder of Europe extends towards the\r\neast, and is divided into two by the Danube. This river flows from west\r\nto east, and discharges itself into the Euxine Sea, leaving on its left\r\nthe entire of Germany commencing from the Rhine, as well as the whole of\r\nthe Getæ, the Tyrigetæ, the Bastarnæ, and the Sauromatæ, as far as the\r\nriver Don, and the Lake Mæotis,[875] on its right being the whole of\r\nThrace and Illyria,[876] and in fine the rest of Greece.\r\n\r\nFronting Europe lie the islands which we have mentioned. Without the\r\nPillars, Gadeira,[877] the Cassiterides,[878] and the Britannic Isles.\r\nWithin the Pillars are the Gymnesian Islands,[879] the other little\r\nislands of the Phœnicians,[880] the Marseillais, and the Ligurians;\r\nthose fronting Italy as far as the islands of Æolus and Sicily, and the\r\nwhole of those[881] along Epirus and Greece, as far as Macedonia and the\r\nThracian Chersonesus.\r\n\r\n31. From the Don and the Mæotis[882] commences [Asia] on this side the\r\nTaurus; beyond these is [Asia] beyond the Taurus. For since this\r\ncontinent is divided into two by the chain of the Taurus, which extends\r\nfrom the extremities of Pamphylia to the shores of the Eastern Sea,[883]\r\ninhabited by the Indians and neighbouring Scythians, the Greeks\r\nnaturally called that part of the continent situated north of these\r\nmountains [Asia] on this side the Taurus, and that on the south [Asia]\r\nbeyond the Taurus. Consequently the parts adjacent to the Mæotis and Don\r\nare on this side the Taurus. The first of these is the territory between\r\nthe Caspian Sea and the Euxine, bounded on one side[884] by the Don, the\r\nExterior Ocean,[885] and the Sea of Hyrcania; on the other[886] by the\r\nIsthmus where it is narrowest from the recess of the Euxine to the\r\nCaspian.\r\n\r\nSecondly, but still on this side the Taurus, are the countries above the\r\nSea of Hyrcania as far as the Indians and Scythians, who dwell along\r\nthe said sea[887] and Mount Imaus. These countries are possessed on the\r\none side by the Mæotæ,[888] and the people dwelling between the Sea of\r\nHyrcania and the Euxine as far as the Caucasus, the Iberians[889] and\r\nAlbanians,[890] viz. the Sauromatians, Scythians,[891] Achæans, Zygi,\r\nand Heniochi: on the other side beyond the Sea of Hyrcania,[892] by the\r\nScythians,[893] Hyrcanians, Parthians, Bactrians, Sogdians, and the\r\nother nations of India farther towards the north. To the south, partly\r\nby the Sea of Hyrcania, and partly by the whole isthmus which separates\r\nthis sea from the Euxine, is situated the greater part of Armenia,\r\nColchis,[894] the whole of Cappadocia[895] as far as the Euxine, and the\r\nTibaranic nations.[896] Further [west] is the country designated on this\r\nside the Halys,[897] containing on the side of the Euxine and Propontis\r\nthe Paphlagonians, Bithynians, Mysians, and Phrygia on the Hellespont,\r\nwhich comprehends the Troad; and on the side of the Ægæan and adjacent\r\nseas Æolia, Ionia, Caria, and Lycia. Inland is the Phrygia which\r\ncontains that portion of Gallo-Græcia styled Galatia, Phrygia\r\nEpictetus,[898] the Lycaonians, and the Lydians.\r\n\r\n32. Next these on this side the Taurus are the mountaineers of\r\nParopamisus, and various tribes of Parthians, Medes, Armenians,\r\nCilicians, with “the Lycaonians,”[899] and Pisidians.[900] After these\r\nmountaineers come the people dwelling beyond the Taurus. First amongst\r\nthese is India, a nation greater and more flourishing than any other;\r\nthey extend as far as the Eastern Sea[901] and the southern part of the\r\nAtlantic. In the most southerly part of this sea opposite to India is\r\nsituated the island of Taprobana,[902] which is not less than Britain.\r\nBeyond India to the west, and leaving the mountains [of the Taurus] on\r\nthe right, is a vast region, miserably inhabited, on account of the\r\nsterility of its soil, by men of different races, who are absolutely in\r\na savage state. They are named Arians, and extend from the mountains to\r\nGedrosia and Carmania.[903] Beyond these towards the sea are the\r\nPersians,[904] the Susians,[905] and the Babylonians,[906] situated\r\nalong the Persian Gulf, besides several smaller neighbouring states. On\r\nthe side of the mountains and amidst the mountains are the Parthians,\r\nthe Medes, the Armenians, and the nations adjoining these, together with\r\nMesopotamia.[907] Beyond Mesopotamia are the countries on this side the\r\nEuphrates; viz. the whole of Arabia Felix, bounded by the entire Arabian\r\nand Persian Gulfs, together with the country of the Scenitæ and\r\nPhylarchi, who are situated along the Euphrates and in Syria. Beyond the\r\nArabian Gulf and as far as the Nile dwell the Ethiopians[908] and\r\nArabians,[909] and next these the Egyptians, Syrians, and\r\nCilicians,[910] both those styled Trachiotæ and others besides, and last\r\nof all the Pamphylians.[911]\r\n\r\n33. After Asia comes Libya, which adjoins Egypt and Ethiopia. The coast\r\nnext us, from Alexandria almost to the Pillars, is in a straight line,\r\nwith the exception of the Syrtes, the sinuosities of some moderately\r\nsized bays, and the projection of the promontories by which they are\r\nformed. The side next the ocean from Ethiopia up to a certain point is\r\nalmost parallel to the former; but after this the southern portions\r\nbecome narrowed into a sharp peak, extending a little beyond the Pillars\r\nof Hercules, and giving to the country something the figure of a\r\ntrapezium. Its appearance, both by the accounts of other writers, and\r\nalso the description given to ourselves by Cnæus Piso, who was governor\r\nof this province, is that of a panther’s skin, being dotted over with\r\nhabitations surrounded by parched and desert land: these habitations the\r\nEgyptians call Auases.[912] This continent offers besides several other\r\npeculiarities, which may be said to divide it into three distinct\r\nportions. Most of the coast next us is very fertile, more especially\r\nabout the Cyrenaic and the parts about Carthage, as far as Maurusia and\r\nthe Pillars of Hercules.[913] Next the ocean it is likewise tolerably\r\nfitted for the habitation of man; but not so the centre of the country,\r\nwhich produces silphium;[914] this for the most part is barren, rugged,\r\nand sandy; and the same is the case with regard to the whole of Asia\r\nlying under the same right line which traverses Ethiopia, the\r\nTroglodytic,[915] Arabia, and the part of Gedrosia occupied by the\r\nIchthyophagi.[916] The people inhabiting Libya are for the most part\r\nunknown to us, as it has rarely been entered, either by armies or\r\nadventurers. But few of its inhabitants from the farther parts come\r\namongst us, and their accounts are both incomplete and not to be relied\r\non. The sum of what they say is as follows. Those which are most\r\nsouthern are called Ethiopians.[917] North of these the principal\r\nnations are the Garamantes, the Pharusians, and the Nigritæ.[918] Still\r\nfarther north are the Gætuli. Close to the sea, and adjoining it next\r\nEgypt, and as far as the Cyrenaic, dwell the Marmaridæ.[919] Above[920]\r\nthe Cyrenaic and the Syrtes[921] are the Psylli and Nasamones,[922] and\r\ncertain of the Gætuli; and after them the Asbystæ[923] and Byzacii,[924]\r\nas far as Carthage. Carthage is vast. Adjoining it are the Numidæ;[925]\r\nof these people the tribes best known to us are called the Masylies and\r\nthe Masæsylii. The most westerly are the Maurusians.[926] The whole\r\nland, from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules, is fertile. Nevertheless\r\nit abounds in wild beasts no less than the interior; and it does not\r\nseem improbable that the cause why the name of Nomades,[927] or\r\nWanderers, was bestowed on certain of these people originated in their\r\nnot being able anciently to devote themselves to husbandry on account of\r\nthe wild beasts. At the present day, when they are well skilled in\r\nhunting, and are besides assisted by the Romans in their rage for the\r\nspectacle of fights with beasts, they are both masters of the beasts and\r\nof husbandry. This finishes what we have to say on the continents.\r\n\r\n34. It now remains for us to speak of the climata.[928] Of these too we\r\nshall give but a general description, commencing with those lines which\r\nwe have denominated elementary, namely, those which determine the\r\ngreatest length and breadth of the [habitable earth], but especially its\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nTo enter fully into this subject is the duty of astronomers. This has\r\nbeen done by Hipparchus, who has noted down (as he says) the differences\r\nof the heavenly appearances for every degree of that quarter of the\r\nglobe in which our habitable earth is situated, namely, from the equator\r\nto the north pole.\r\n\r\nWhat is beyond our habitable earth it is not however the business of the\r\ngeographer to consider. Nor yet even in regard to the various parts of\r\nthe habitable earth must too minute and numerous differences be noticed,\r\nsince to the man of the world they are perplexing; it will suffice to\r\ngive the most striking and simple of the statements of Hipparchus.\r\nAssuming, as he does himself after the assertion of Eratosthenes, that\r\nthe circumference of the earth is 252,000 stadia, the differences of the\r\n[celestial] phenomena will not be great for each [degree] within the\r\nlimits between which the habitable earth is contained. Supposing we cut\r\nthe grand circle of the earth into 360 divisions, each of these\r\ndivisions will consist of 700 stadia. This is the calculation adopted by\r\n[Hipparchus] to fix the distances, which [as we said] should be taken\r\nunder the before-mentioned meridian of Meroe. He commences at the\r\nregions situated under the equator, and stopping from time to time at\r\nevery 700 stadia along the whole length of the meridian above mentioned,\r\nproceeds to describe the celestial phenomena as they appear from each.\r\nBut the equator is not the place for us to start from. For even if there\r\nbe there a habitable region, as some suppose, it forms a habitable earth\r\nto itself, a narrow slip enclosed by the regions uninhabitable on\r\naccount of the heat; and can be no part of our habitable earth. Now the\r\ngeographer should attend to none but our own habitable earth, which is\r\nconfined by certain boundaries; on the south by the parallel which\r\npasses over the Cinnamon Country;[929] on the north by that which passes\r\nover Ierna.[930] But keeping in mind the scheme of our geography, we\r\nhave no occasion to mark all the places comprehended within this\r\ndistance, nor yet all the celestial phenomena. We must however\r\ncommence, as Hipparchus does, with the southern regions.\r\n\r\n35. He tells us that the people who dwell under the parallel of the\r\nCinnamon Country, which he places at 3000 stadia south of Meroe,[931]\r\nand 8800 [north] of the equator, live nearly at equal distances between\r\nthe equator and the summer tropic which passes by Syene; for Syene is\r\n5000 stadia [north] of Meroe. They are the first[932] for whom the whole\r\n[constellation] of the Lesser Bear is comprised within the Artic Circle,\r\nand to whom it is always visible. For the bright and most southern star,\r\nat the tip of the tail, is here contained within the Arctic Circle, and\r\nappears to touch the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian Gulf lies eastward parallel to the said meridian. Its\r\negress[933] into the Exterior Ocean is [in the same latitude as] the\r\nCinnamon Country, the place where anciently they used to hunt the\r\nelephants. The parallel of the Cinnamon Country on the one side[934]\r\npasses a little south of Taprobana, or perhaps over its southern\r\nextremity; and on the other side[935] over the most southern parts of\r\nLibya.[936]\r\n\r\n36. At Meroe and Ptolemais[937] in the Troglodytic the longest day\r\nconsists of thirteen equinoctial hours. These cities are at nearly equal\r\ndistances between the equator and Alexandria, the preponderance on the\r\nside of the equator being only 1800 stadia. The parallel of Meroe passes\r\non one side[938] over unknown countries, and on the other[939] over the\r\nextremities of India.[940] At Syene, and at Berenice, which is situated\r\non the Arabian Gulf and in the Troglodytic, at the summer solstice the\r\nsun is vertical, and the longest day consists of thirteen equinoctial\r\nhours and a half, and the whole of the Greater Bear appears within the\r\nArctic Circle, with the exception of his thighs, the tip of his tail,\r\nand one of the stars composing his body. The parallel of Syene traverses\r\non one side[941] the portion of Gedrosia occupied by the Ichthyophagi,\r\nand India; and on the other side[942] the countries situated south of\r\nCyrene by rather less than 5000 stadia.\r\n\r\n37. In all the countries situated between the tropic and the equatorial\r\ncircle, the shadows fall [alternately] on either side, north and south.\r\nIn those which are north of Syene and beyond the summer tropic the\r\nshadows at mid-day fall to the north. The former are called amphiscii,\r\nthe latter heteroscii. There is also another method of determining what\r\nplaces are under the tropic, which we spoke of in our observations on\r\nthe zones. The soil is sandy, arid, and produces nothing but silphium,\r\nwhile more to the south the land is well irrigated and fertile.\r\n\r\n38. In the countries situated about 400 stadia south of the parallel of\r\nAlexandria and Cyrene, where the longest day consists of fourteen\r\nequinoctial hours, Arcturus passes the zenith, slightly declining\r\ntowards the south. At Alexandria at the time of the equinox the\r\nproportion which the gnomon bears to the shadow is as five to\r\nseven.[943] Thus they are south of Carthage 1300 stadia, that is,\r\nadmitting that in Carthage at the time of the equinox the proportion\r\nwhich the gnomon bears to the shadow is as eleven to seven. This\r\nparallel on the one side[944] passes by Cyrene and the regions 900\r\nstadia south of Carthage as far as the midst of Maurusia;[945] and on\r\nthe other side[946] through Egypt,[947] Cœlosyria, Upper Syria,\r\nBabylonia, Susiana,[948] Persia,[949] Carmania,[950] Upper\r\nGedrosia,[951] and India.\r\n\r\n39. At Ptolemais in Phœnicia,[952] and at Sidon[953] and Tyre,[954] the\r\nlongest day consists of fourteen hours and a quarter. These cities are\r\nnorth of Alexandria by about 1600 stadia, and north of Carthage about\r\n700. In the Peloponnesus, and about the middle of Rhodes, at\r\nXanthus[955] in Lycia, or a little to the south of this place, and at\r\n400 stadia south of Syracuse,[956] the longest day consists of fourteen\r\nand a half equinoctial hours. These places are distant from Alexandria\r\n3640 stadia.... This parallel, according to Eratosthenes, passes\r\nthrough Caria, Lycaonia, Cataonia, Media, the Caspian Gates, and India\r\nnext the Caucasus.[957]\r\n\r\n40. In the parts of the Troad next Alexandria[958] in Amphipolis,[959]\r\nApollonia in Epirus,[960] the countries just south of Rome and north of\r\nNeapolis, the longest day consists of fifteen hours. This parallel is\r\ndistant from that of Alexandria in Egypt 7000 stadia to the north, above\r\n28,800 stadia north of the equator, and 3400 stadia from the parallel of\r\nRhodes; it is south of Byzantium, Nicæa,[961] and Marseilles 1500\r\nstadia. The parallel of Lysimachia[962] is a little to the north, and\r\naccording to Eratosthenes passes through Mysia,[963] Paphlagonia,\r\nSinope,[964] Hyrcania,[965] and Bactra.[966]\r\n\r\n41. About Byzantium the longest day consists of fifteen and a quarter\r\nequinoctial hours; the proportion borne by the gnomon to the shadow at\r\nthe summer solstice, is as 120 to 42, minus one-fifth. These places are\r\ndistant[967] from the middle of Rhodes about 4900 stadia, and 30,300\r\nfrom the equator. Sailing into the Euxine and advancing 1400 stadia to\r\nthe north, the longest day is found to consist of fifteen and a half\r\nequinoctial hours. These places are equi-distant between the pole and\r\nequatorial circle; the arctic circle is at their zenith, the star in the\r\nneck of Cassiopeia is within this circle, the star forming the right\r\nelbow of Perseus being a little more to the north.\r\n\r\n42. In regions 3800 stadia north of Byzantium the longest day consists\r\nof sixteen equinoctial hours; the constellation Cassiopeia being brought\r\nwithin the arctic circle. These regions are situated around [the mouth\r\nof] the Dnieper and the southern parts of the Mæotis, at a distance from\r\nthe equator of 34,100 stadia; and the northern part of the horizon\r\nduring almost all the summer nights is illuminated by the light of the\r\nsun; a certain degree of light continuing from sunset to sunrise. For\r\nthe summer tropic is distant from the horizon only the half and the\r\ntwelfth part of a sign[968] [of the zodiac], and this therefore is the\r\ngreatest distance of the sun below the horizon at midnight. With us when\r\nthe sun is at this distance from the horizon before sunrise and after\r\nsunset, the atmosphere is enlightened to the east and west respectively.\r\nIn the winter the sun when at the highest is nine cubits above the\r\nhorizon.[969] These places, according to Eratosthenes, are distant from\r\nMeroe rather more than 23,000 stadia,[970] for he says that [from the\r\nparallel of Meroe] to the Hellespont[971] there are 18,000 stadia, and\r\nthence to the Dnieper 5000 more. In regions distant 6300 stadia from\r\nByzantium, and north of the Mæotis, the sun during the winter time is,\r\nwhen highest, six cubits [above the horizon]. The longest day consists\r\nof seventeen hours.\r\n\r\n43. The countries beyond this which border upon the regions\r\nuninhabitable on account of their cold, have no interest to the\r\ngeographer. He who desires to learn about them, and the celestial\r\nphenomena which Hipparchus has described, but which we pass over as\r\nbeing too much in detail for our present undertaking, must seek for them\r\nin that author. The statements of Posidonius concerning the periscii,\r\nthe amphiscii, and the heteroscii are likewise too detailed. Still we\r\nmust touch on these points sufficiently to explain his view, and to\r\npoint out how far such matters are serviceable in geography, and how far\r\nnot. The terms made use of refer to the shadows cast from the sun. The\r\nsun appears to the senses to describe a circle parallel to that of the\r\nearth.[972] Of those people for whom each revolution of the earth\r\nproduces a day and a night, the sun being carried first over, then\r\nunder, the earth, some are denominated amphiscii, others heteroscii. The\r\namphiscii are the inhabitants of countries in which when a gnomon is\r\nplaced perpendicularly on a plane surface, the shadow which it casts at\r\nmid-day, falls first to one side then to the other, as the sun illumines\r\nfirst this side, then that. This however only occurs in places situated\r\nbetween the tropics. The heteroscii are those amongst whom the shadow\r\nalways falls to the north, as with us; or to the south, as amongst\r\nthose who inhabit the other temperate zone. This occurs in all those\r\nregions where the arctic circle is less than the tropic. Where however\r\nit becomes the same as or greater than the tropic, this shows the\r\ncommencement of the periscii, who extend thence to the pole. In regions\r\nwhere the sun remains above the horizon during an entire revolution of\r\nthe earth, the shadow must evidently have turned in a complete circle\r\nround the gnomon. On this account he named them periscii. However they\r\nhave nought to do with geography, inasmuch as the regions are not\r\nhabitable on account of the cold, as we stated in our review of Pytheas.\r\nNor is there any use in determining the size of this uninhabitable\r\nregion, [it is enough to have established] that those countries, having\r\nthe tropic for their arctic circle, are situated beneath the circle\r\nwhich is described by the pole of the zodiac[973] in the [diurnal]\r\nrevolution of the earth, and that the distance between the equator and\r\nthe tropic equals four-sixtieths of the great circle [of the earth].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._ The pages of Casaubon’s edition of 1620 are given to\r\nfacilitate reference to various editions and translations of Strabo.\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nSPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Having thus given a general view of Geography, it will now be proper\r\nto describe each separate country in detail, as we engaged to do. We\r\nfancy that the method which we have adopted in the division of our\r\nsubject, up to this point, has been correct; and we now recommence with\r\nEurope and the various countries into which it is divided, on the same\r\nprinciples as formerly, and induced by the same reasons.\r\n\r\n2. The first division of this continent towards the west is Iberia, as\r\nwe before stated. The greater part of this country is but little fitted\r\nfor habitation; consisting chiefly of mountains, woods, and plains\r\ncovered with a light meagre soil, the irrigation of which is likewise\r\nuncertain. The part next the north, which borders on the ocean, is\r\nextremely cold, and besides its rugged character, has no communication\r\nor intercourse with other [countries], and thus to dwell there is\r\nattended with peculiar hardship. Such is the character of this portion;\r\non the other hand, almost the whole of the south is fertile, especially\r\nwhat is beyond the Pillars [of Hercules]. This however will be shown\r\nmore in detail, but we must first describe the figure and extent [of the\r\ncountry].\r\n\r\n3. In shape it resembles a hide stretched out in length from west to\r\neast, the forepart[974] towards the east, its breadth being from north\r\nto south. Its length is about 6000 stadia; the greatest breadth is 5000;\r\nwhile there are parts considerably less [CAS. 137] than 3000,\r\nparticularly in the vicinity of the Pyrenees, which form the eastern\r\nside. This chain of mountains stretches without interruption from north\r\nto south,[975] and divides Keltica[976] from Iberia. The breadth both of\r\nKeltica and Iberia is irregular, the narrowest part in both of them from\r\nthe Mediterranean to the [Atlantic] Ocean being near the Pyrenees,\r\nparticularly on either side of that chain; this gives rise to gulfs both\r\non the side of the Ocean, and also of the Mediterranean; the largest of\r\nthese are denominated the Keltic or Galatic Gulfs,[977] and they render\r\nthe [Keltic] Isthmus narrower than that of Iberia.[978] The Pyrenees\r\nform the eastern side of Iberia, and the Mediterranean the southern from\r\nthe Pyrenees to the Pillars of Hercules, thence the exterior\r\n[ocean][979] as far as the Sacred Promontory.[980] The third or western\r\nside runs nearly parallel to the Pyrenees from the Sacred Promontory to\r\nthe promontory of the Artabri, called [Cape] Nerium.[981] The fourth\r\nside extends hence to the northern extremity of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n4. We will now commence our detailed account, beginning from the Sacred\r\nPromontory. This is the most western point not only of Europe, but of\r\nthe whole habitable earth. For the habitable earth is bounded to the\r\nwest by two continents, namely, the extremities of Europe and\r\nLibya,[982] which are inhabited respectively by the Iberians and the\r\nMaurusians.[983] But the Iberian extremity, at the promontory[984] we\r\nhave mentioned, juts out beyond the other as much as 1500 stadia.[985]\r\nThe region adjacent to this cape they call in the Latin tongue\r\n_Cuneum_,[986] which signifies _a wedge_. The promontory which projects\r\ninto the sea, Artemidorus (who states that he has himself been at the\r\nplace) compares to a ship; three little islands, [he says,] each having\r\na small harbour, contribute to give it this form; the former island\r\nresembling the beak of the ship, and the two latter the beams on each\r\nside of the ship’s bows. [He adds] that there is no temple of Hercules\r\nshown there, as Ephorus falsely states, nor yet any altar [to him] nor\r\nto any other divinity; but in many parts there are three or four stones\r\nplaced together, which are turned by all travellers who arrive there, in\r\naccordance with a certain local custom, and are changed in position by\r\nsuch as turn them incorrectly.[987] It is not lawful to offer sacrifice\r\nthere, nor yet to approach the place during the night, for it is said\r\nthat then the gods take up their abode at the place. Those who go\r\nthither to view it stay at a neighbouring village over-night, and\r\nproceed to the place on the morrow, carrying water with them, as there\r\nis none to be procured there.\r\n\r\n5. It is quite possible that these things are so, and we ought not to\r\ndisbelieve them. Not so however with regard to the other common and\r\nvulgar reports; for Posidonius tells us the common people say that in\r\nthe countries next the ocean the sun appears larger as he sets, and\r\nmakes a noise resembling the sound of hot metal in cold water, as though\r\nthe sea were hissing as the sun was submerged in its depths. The\r\nstatement [of Artemidorus] is also false, that night follows immediately\r\non the setting of the sun: it does not follow immediately, although\r\ncertainly the interval is short, as in other great seas. For when he\r\nsets behind mountains the agency of the false light continues the day\r\nfor a long period; over the sea the twilight is shorter, still darkness\r\ndoes not immediately supervene. The same thing may be remarked in large\r\nplains. The image of the sun is enlarged on the seas at its rising as\r\nwell as at its setting, because at these times a larger mass of\r\n[CAS. 138] exhalations rises from the humid element; and the eye looking\r\nthrough these exhalations, sees images refracted into larger forms, as\r\nobserved through tubes. The same thing happens when the setting sun or\r\nmoon is seen through a dry and thin cloud, when those bodies likewise\r\nappear reddish.[988] Posidonius tells us that, having himself passed\r\nthirty days at Gades,[989] during which time he carefully observed the\r\nsetting of the sun, he is convinced of the falsity of Artemidorus’s\r\naccount. This latter writer tells us, that at the time of its setting\r\nthe sun appears a hundred times larger than its ordinary size, and that\r\nnight immediately succeeds. If we attend to his account, we cannot\r\nbelieve that he himself remarked this phenomenon at the Sacred\r\nPromontory,[990] for he tells us that no one can approach during the\r\nnight; therefore they cannot approach at sunset, since night immediately\r\nsupervenes thereupon. Neither did he observe it from any other part of\r\nthe coast washed by the ocean, for Gades is upon the ocean, and both\r\nPosidonius and many others testify that there such is not the case.\r\n\r\n6. The sea-coast next the Sacred Promontory forms on one side the\r\ncommencement of the western coast of Spain as far as the outlet of the\r\nriver Tagus; and on the other forms the southern coast as far as the\r\noutlet of another river, named the Guadiana.[991] Both of these rivers\r\ndescend from the eastern parts [of Spain]; but the former, which is much\r\nlarger than the other, pursues a straight course towards the west, while\r\nthe Guadiana bends its course towards the south.[992] They enclose an\r\nextent of country peopled for the most part by Kelts and certain\r\nLusitanians,[993] whom the Romans caused to settle here from the\r\nopposite side of the Tagus. Higher up, the country is inhabited by the\r\nCarpetani,[994] the Oretani,[995] and a large number of Vettones.[996]\r\nThis district is moderately fertile, but that which is beyond it to the\r\neast and south, does not give place in superiority to any part of the\r\nhabitable earth with which it may be compared, in the excellence of its\r\nproductions both of land and sea. This is the country through which the\r\nriver Guadalquiver[997] flows. This river takes its rise from the same\r\nparts as the Guadiana[998] and the Tagus, and is between these two in\r\nsize.[999] Like the Guadiana, the commencement of its course flows\r\ntowards the west, but it afterwards turns to the south, and discharges\r\nitself at the same side of the coast as that river.\r\n\r\nFrom this river[997] the country has received the name of Bætica; it is\r\ncalled Turdetania by the inhabitants, who are themselves denominated\r\nTurdetani, and Turduli. Some think these two names refer to one nation,\r\nwhile others believe that they designate two distinct people. Of this\r\nlatter opinion is Polybius, who imagines that the Turduli dwell more to\r\nthe north than the Turdetani. At the present day however there does not\r\nappear to be any distinction between them. These people are esteemed to\r\nbe the most intelligent of all the Iberians; they have an alphabet, and\r\npossess ancient writings, poems, and metrical laws six thousand years\r\nold, as they say. The other Iberians are likewise furnished with an\r\nalphabet, although not of the same form, nor do they speak the same\r\nlanguage. Their country,[1000] which is on this side the [CAS. 139]\r\nGuadiana, extends eastward as far as Oretania,[1001] and southward along\r\nthe sea-coast from the outlets of the Guadiana to the Pillars [of\r\nHercules]. But it is necessary that I should enter into further\r\nparticulars concerning this and the neighbouring places, in order to\r\nillustrate their excellence and fertility.\r\n\r\n7. Between this coast, where the Guadalquiver and Guadiana discharge\r\nthemselves, and the extremities of Maurusia, the Atlantic Ocean forms\r\nthe strait at the Pillars [of Hercules] by which it is connected with\r\nthe Mediterranean. Here is situated Calpe,[1002] the mountain of the\r\nIberians who are denominated Bastetani, by others Bastuli. Its\r\ncircumference is not large, but it is so high and steep as to resemble\r\nan island in the distance. Sailing from the Mediterranean into the\r\nAtlantic, it is left on the right hand. At a distance of 40 stadia from\r\nthis [mountain] is the considerable and ancient city of Carteia,\r\nformerly a marine arsenal of the Iberians. Some assert that it was\r\nfounded by Hercules; of this number is Timosthenes,[1003] who tells us\r\nit was anciently called Heraclæa, and that vast walls and ship-sheds are\r\nstill shown.\r\n\r\n8. Next to these is Mellaria,[1004] where they make salted provisions.\r\nAfter this the city and river[1005] of Belo. Here the merchandise and\r\nsalted provisions for Tingis in Maurusia are principally shipped. There\r\nwas a city named Zelis[1006] near to Tingis, but the Romans transferred\r\nit to the opposite coast [of Spain], and having placed there in addition\r\nsome of the inhabitants of Tingis, and sent over also some of their own\r\npeople, they then gave to the city the name of Julia Joza.[1007] Beyond\r\nthis is Gadeira,[1008] an island separated from Turdetania by a narrow\r\nstrait, and distant from Calpe about 750 stadia, or, as others say, 800.\r\nThis island has nothing to distinguish it above others, but owing to the\r\nboldness of its people in their expeditions by sea, and their\r\nfriendship with the Romans, has attained to that pitch of good fortune,\r\nthat although situated at the farthest extremities of the earth, it\r\npossesses a greater celebrity than any other island. But we will\r\ndescribe it when we come to speak of the other islands.\r\n\r\n9. Next after [Cadiz] is the port of Menestheus,[1009] and the estuary\r\nnear to Asta and Nebrissa.[1010] These estuaries are valleys filled by\r\nthe sea during its flood-tides, up which you may sail into the interior,\r\nand to the cities built on them, in the same way as you sail up a river.\r\nImmediately after are the two outlets of the Guadalquiver.[1011] The\r\nisland embraced by these mouths has a coast of a hundred stadia, or\r\nrather more according to others. Hereabouts is the Oracle of\r\nMenestheus,[1012] and the tower of Cæpio,[1013] built upon a rock and\r\nwashed on all sides by the sea. This is an admirable work, resembling\r\nthe Pharos, and constructed for the safety of vessels. For the mud\r\ncarried out by the river forms shallows, and sunken rocks are also\r\nscattered before it, so that a beacon was greatly needed. Thence sailing\r\nup the river is the city of Ebura,[1014] and the temple of\r\nPhosphorus,[1015] which they call _Lux Dubia_.[1016] You then pass up\r\nthe other estuaries; and after these the river Guadiana, which has also\r\ntwo mouths,[1017] up either of which you may sail. Lastly, beyond is the\r\nSacred Promontory,[1018] distant from Gadeira[1019] less than 2000\r\nstadia. Some say that from the Sacred Promontory to the mouth of the\r\nGuadiana there are 60 miles; thence to the mouth of the Guadalquiver\r\n100; and from this latter place to Gadeira 70.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n[CASAUB. 141] 1. Turdetania lies above the coast on this side the\r\nGuadiana,[1020] and is intersected by the river Guadalquiver.[1021] It\r\nis bounded on the west and north by the river Guadiana; on the east by\r\ncertain of the Carpetani and the Oretani; on the south by those of the\r\nBastetani who inhabit the narrow slip of coast between Calpe and\r\nGadeira, and by the sea beyond as far as the Guadiana. The Bastetani\r\nwhom I have mentioned, together with the people on the other side the\r\nGuadiana, and many of the places adjacent, belong to Turdetania. The\r\nsize of this country in its length and breadth does not exceed two\r\nthousand stadia, still it contains a vast number of towns; two hundred,\r\nit is said. Those best known are situated on the rivers, estuaries, and\r\nsea; but the two which have acquired the greatest name and importance\r\nare, Corduba, founded by Marcellus,[1022] and the city of the\r\nGaditanians.[1023] The latter for its naval importance, and its alliance\r\nwith the Romans; and the former on account of its fertility and extent,\r\na considerable portion of the Guadalquiver flowing by it; in addition to\r\nthis it has been from its commencement inhabited by picked men, whether\r\nnatives or Romans; and it was the first colony planted by the Romans in\r\nthese parts.\r\n\r\nAfter this city and that of the Gaditanians, Hispalis[1024] is the most\r\nnoted. This also is a Roman colony. Commerce is still carried on here,\r\nalthough at the present moment the city of Bætis[1025] though not so\r\nfinely built, is outshining it, on account of the honour it has received\r\nfrom the soldiers of Cæsar taking up their quarters there.\r\n\r\n2. After these are Italica,[1026] and Ilipa,[1027] situated on the\r\nGuadalquiver; farther on are Astygis,[1028] Carmo,[1029] and Obulco; and\r\nbesides these Munda,[1030] Ategua, Urso,[1031] Tukkis,[1032]\r\nJulia,[1033] and Ægua, where the sons of Pompey were defeated. None of\r\nthese places are far from Corduba. Munda is in some sort regarded as the\r\nmetropolis of the whole district. This place is distant from Carteia\r\n1400[1034] stadia, and it was here that Cnæus fled after his defeat, and\r\nsailing thence landed on a rocky height overlooking the sea, where he\r\nwas murdered. His brother Sextus, having escaped from Corduba, after\r\ncarrying on the war for a short time in Spain, caused a revolt in\r\nSicily. Flying thence into Asia he was seized at Miletus[1035] by the\r\ngenerals[1036] of Antony, and executed. Amongst the Kelts the most\r\nfamous place is Conistorgis.[1037] Upon the estuaries is Asta,[1038] in\r\nwhich the Gaditani mostly hold their assemblies; it is opposite the\r\nsea-port of the island, at a distance of not more than 100 stadia.\r\n\r\n3. A vast number of people dwell along the Guadalquiver; and you may\r\nsail up it almost 1200 stadia from the sea to Corduba, and the places a\r\nlittle higher up. The banks and little islets of this river are\r\ncultivated with the greatest diligence. [CASAUB. 142.] The eye is also\r\ndelighted with groves and gardens, which in this district are met with\r\nin the highest perfection. As far as Ispalis, which is a distance of not\r\nless than 500 stadia, the river is navigable for ships[1039] of\r\nconsiderable size; but for the cities higher up, as far as Ilipas,\r\nsmaller vessels are employed, and thence to Corduba river-boats. These\r\nare now constructed of planks joined together, but they were formerly\r\nmade out of a single trunk. Above this to Castlon the river is no longer\r\nnavigable. A chain of mountains, rich in metal, runs parallel to the\r\nGuadalquiver,[1040] approaching the river sometimes more, sometimes\r\nless, towards the north.\r\n\r\nThere is much silver found in the parts about Ilipas and Sisapo, both in\r\nthat which is called the old town and the new. There are copper and gold\r\nabout the Cotinæ.[1041] These mountains are on the left as you sail up\r\nthe river; on the right there is a vast and elevated plain, fertile,\r\nfull of large trees, and containing excellent pasturage. The\r\nGuadiana[1042] is likewise navigable, but not for vessels equally large,\r\nnor yet so far up. It is also bordered by mountains containing metal,\r\nand extends as far as the Tagus. Districts which contain metals must, of\r\nnecessity, be rugged and poor,[1043] as indeed are those adjoining\r\nCarpetania, and still more those next the Keltiberians. The same is the\r\ncase with Bæturia, the plains of which, bordering on the Guadiana, are\r\narid.\r\n\r\n4. Turdetania, on the other hand, is marvellously fertile, and abounds\r\nin every species of produce. The value of its productions is doubled by\r\nmeans of exportation, the surplus products finding a ready sale amongst\r\nthe numerous ship-owners. This results from its rivers and estuaries,\r\nwhich, as we have said, resemble rivers, and by which you may sail from\r\nthe sea to the inland towns, not only in small, but even in large-sized\r\nskiffs. For the whole country above the coast, and situated between the\r\nSacred Promontory[1044] and the Pillars, consists of an extended plain.\r\nHere in many places are hollows running inland from the sea, which\r\nresemble moderately-sized ravines or the beds of rivers, and extend for\r\nmany stadia. These are filled by the approach of the sea at high tide,\r\nand may be navigated as easily, or even more so than rivers. They are\r\nnavigated much the same as rivers; the sea, meeting with no obstacle,\r\nenters like the flow of a river at flood-tide. The sea comes in here\r\nwith greater force than in the other places; for being forced from the\r\nwide ocean into the narrow strait,[1045] formed by the coast of Maurusia\r\nand Iberia, it experiences recoils, and thus is borne full into the\r\nretiring parts of the land. Some of these shallows are left dry as the\r\ntide ebbs, while others are never destitute of water; others again\r\ncontain islands, of this kind are the estuaries between the Sacred\r\nPromontory[1046] and the Pillars, where the tide comes in with more\r\nviolence than at other places. Such a tide is of considerable advantage\r\nto sailors, since it makes the estuaries both fuller and more spacious,\r\nfrequently swelling them to a breadth of eight[1047] stadia, so that the\r\nwhole land, so to speak, is rendered navigable, thus giving wonderful\r\nfacility both for the export and import of merchandise. Nevertheless\r\nthere is some inconvenience. For in the navigation of the rivers, the\r\nsailors run considerable danger both in ascending and descending, owing\r\nto the violence with which the flood-tide encounters the current of the\r\nstream as it flows down. The ebb-tides are likewise the cause of much\r\ndamage in these estuaries, for resulting as they do from the same cause\r\nas the flood-tides, they are frequently so rapid as to leave the vessel\r\non dry land; and herds in passing over to the islands that are in these\r\nestuaries are sometimes drowned [in the passage] and sometimes surprised\r\nin the islands, and endeavouring to cross back again to the continent,\r\nare unable, and perish in the attempt. They say that certain of the\r\ncattle, having narrowly observed what takes place, wait till the sea has\r\nretired, and then cross over to the mainland.\r\n\r\n5. The men [of the country], being well acquainted with the nature of\r\nthese places, and that the estuaries would very well answer the same\r\npurpose as rivers, founded cities and other settlements along them the\r\nsame as along rivers. Of this number are Asta, Nebrissa,[1048]\r\nOnoba,[1049] Ossonoba, Mænoba,[CASAUB. 143] besides many others. The\r\ncanals which have been cut in various directions are also found useful\r\nin the traffic which is carried on between place and place, both amongst\r\nthe people themselves and with foreigners. The conflux of water at the\r\nflood-tides is also valuable, as rendering navigable the isthmuses which\r\nseparate the different pieces of water, thus making it possible to ferry\r\nover from the rivers into the estuaries, and from the estuaries into the\r\nrivers. Their trade is wholly carried on with Italy and Rome. The\r\nnavigation is excellent as far as the Pillars, (excepting perhaps some\r\nlittle difficulties at the Strait,) and equally so on the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere the voyages are very calm, especially to those who keep the high\r\nseas. This is a great advantage to merchant-vessels. The winds on the\r\nhigh seas blow regularly; and peace reigns there now, the pirates having\r\nbeen put down, so that in every respect the voyage is facile. Posidonius\r\ntells us he observed the singular phenomenon in his journey from\r\nIberia,[1050] that in this sea, as far as the Gulf of Sardinia, the\r\nsouth-east[1051] winds blow periodically. And on this account he strove\r\nin vain for three whole months to reach Italy, being driven about by the\r\nwinds against the Gymnesian islands,[1052] Sardinia, and the opposite\r\ncoasts of Libya.\r\n\r\n6. Large quantities of corn and wine are exported from Turdetania,\r\nbesides much oil, which is of the first quality;[1053] also wax, honey,\r\npitch, large quantities of the kermes-berry,[1054] and vermilion not\r\ninferior to that of Sinope.[1055] The country furnishes the timber for\r\ntheir ship-building. They have likewise mineral salt, and not a few salt\r\nstreams. A considerable quantity of salted fish is exported, not only\r\nfrom hence, but also from the remainder of the coast beyond the Pillars,\r\nequal to that of Pontus. Formerly they exported large quantities of\r\ngarments, but they now send the [unmanufactured] wool, which is superior\r\neven to that of the Coraxi,[1056] and remarkable for its beauty. Rams\r\nfor the purpose of covering fetch a talent. The stuffs manufactured by\r\nthe Saltiatæ[1057] are of incomparable texture. There is a\r\nsuper-abundance of cattle, and a great variety of game: while, on the\r\nother hand, of destructive animals there are scarcely any, with the\r\nexception of certain little hares which burrow in the ground, and are\r\ncalled by some leberides.[1058] These creatures destroy both seeds and\r\ntrees by gnawing their roots. They are met with throughout almost the\r\nwhole of Iberia,[1059] and extend to Marseilles, infesting likewise the\r\nislands. It is said that formerly the inhabitants of the Gymnesian\r\nislands[1060] sent a deputation to the Romans soliciting that a new land\r\nmight be given them, as they were quite driven out of their country by\r\nthese animals, being no longer able to stand against their vast\r\nmultitudes.[1061] It is possible that people should be obliged to have\r\nrecourse to such an expedient for help in waging war in so great an\r\nextremity, which however but seldom happens, and is a plague produced by\r\nsome pestilential state of the atmosphere, which at other times has\r\nproduced serpents and rats in like abundance; but for the ordinary\r\nincrease of these little hares, many ways of hunting have been devised,\r\namongst others by wild cats from Africa,[1062] trained for the purpose.\r\nHaving muzzled these, they turn them into the holes, when they either\r\ndrag out the animals they find there with their claws, or compel them to\r\nfly to the surface of the earth, where they are taken by people standing\r\nby for that purpose. The large amount of the exports from Turdetania is\r\nevinced by the size and number of their ships. Merchant-vessels of the\r\ngreatest size sail thence to Dicæarchia[1063] and [CAS. 145] Ostia, a\r\nRoman port; they are in number nearly equal to those which arrive from\r\nLibya.\r\n\r\n7. Such is the wealth of the inland part of Turdetania, and its maritime\r\nportions are found fully to equal it in the richness of their\r\nsea-productions. In fact, oysters and every variety of shell-fish,\r\nremarkable both for their number and size, are found along the whole of\r\nthe exterior sea, but here in particular. It is probable that the flow\r\nand ebb tides, which are particularly strong here, contribute both to\r\ntheir quantity and size, on account of the great number of pools and\r\nstanding waters which they form.[1064] The same is the case with regard\r\nto all kinds of cetacea, narwhals, whales, and physeteri,[1065] which\r\nwhen they blow [up the water from their snouts] appear to observers from\r\na distance to resemble a cloud shaped like a column. The congers are\r\nquite monstrous, far surpassing in size those of our [sea];[1066] so are\r\nthe lampreys, and many other fish of the same kind. It is said that in\r\nCarteia there are kerukæ[1067] and cuttle-fish which would contain as\r\nmuch as ten cotylæ.[1068] In the parts more exterior there are lampreys\r\nand congers weighing 80 minæ,[1069] and polypes a talent,[1070] also\r\nteuthidæ[1071] two cubits in length, with other fish in proportion.\r\nShoals of rich fat thunny are driven hither from the sea-coast beyond.\r\nThey feed on the fruit of a species of stunted oak, which grows at the\r\nbottom of the sea, and produces very large acorns. The same oaks grow in\r\nlarge numbers throughout the land of Iberia, their roots are of the same\r\nsize as those of the full-grown oak, although the tree itself never\r\nattains the height of a low shrub. So great is the quantity of fruit\r\nwhich it produces, that at the season when they are ripe, the whole\r\ncoast on either side of the Pillars is covered with acorns which have\r\nbeen thrown up by the tides: the quantity however is always less on\r\nthis side the Pillars [than on the other]. Polybius states that these\r\nacorns are ejected [by the sea] as far as [the shores of] Latium,\r\nunless, he adds, Sardo[1072] and the neighbouring districts also produce\r\nthem. The thunny-fish become gradually thinner, owing to the failure of\r\ntheir food, as they approach the Pillars from the outer sea. This fish,\r\nin fact, may be regarded as a kind of sea-hog, being fond of the acorn,\r\nand growing marvellously fat upon it; and whenever acorns are abundant,\r\nthunny-fish are abundant likewise.\r\n\r\n8. Of the various riches of the aforenamed country,[1073] not the least\r\nis its wealth in metals: this every one will particularly esteem and\r\nadmire. Of metals, in fact, the whole country of the Iberians is full,\r\nalthough it is not equally fertile and flourishing throughout,\r\nespecially in those parts where the metals most abound. It is seldom\r\nthat any place is blessed with both these advantages, and likewise\r\nseldom that the different kinds of metals abound in one small territory.\r\nTurdetania, however, and the surrounding districts surpass so entirely\r\nin this respect, that however you may wish, words cannot convey their\r\nexcellence. Gold, silver, copper, and iron, equal in amount and of\r\nsimilar quality, not having been hitherto discovered in any other part\r\nof the world.[1074] Gold is not only dug from the mines, but likewise\r\ncollected; sand containing gold being washed down by the rivers and\r\ntorrents. It is frequently met with in arid districts, but here the gold\r\nis not visible to the sight, whereas in those which are overflowed the\r\ngrains of gold are seen glittering. On this account they cause water to\r\nflow over the arid places in order to make the grains shine; they also\r\ndig pits, and make use of other contrivances for washing the sand, and\r\nseparating the gold from it; so that at the present day more gold is\r\nprocured by washing than by digging it from the mines. The Galatæ affirm\r\nthat the mines along the Kemmenus mountains[1075] and their side of the\r\nPyrenees are superior; but most people prefer those on this side. They\r\nsay that sometimes amongst the [CAS. 146] grains of gold lumps have been\r\nfound weighing half a pound, these they call _palæ_; they need but\r\nlittle refining.[1076] They also say that in splitting open stones they\r\nfind small lumps, resembling paps. And that when they have melted the\r\ngold, and purified it by means of a kind of aluminous earth, the residue\r\nleft is _electrum_. This, which contains a mixture of silver and gold,\r\nbeing again subjected to the fire, the silver is separated and the gold\r\nleft [pure]; for this metal is easily dissipated and fat,[1077] and on\r\nthis account gold is most easily melted by straw, the flame of which is\r\nsoft, and bearing a similarity [to the gold], causes it easily to\r\ndissolve: whereas coal, besides wasting a great deal, melts it too much\r\nby reason of its vehemence, and carries it off [in vapour]. In the beds\r\nof the rivers the sand is either collected and washed in boats close by,\r\nor else a pit is dug to which the earth is carried and there washed. The\r\nfurnaces for silver are constructed lofty, in order that the vapour,\r\nwhich is dense and pestilent, may be raised and carried off. Certain of\r\nthe copper mines are called gold mines, which would seem to show that\r\nformerly gold was dug from them.\r\n\r\n9. Posidonius, in praising the amount and excellence of the metals,\r\ncannot refrain from his accustomed rhetoric, and becomes quite\r\nenthusiastic in exaggeration. He tells us we are not to disbelieve the\r\nfable, that formerly the forests having been set on fire, the earth,\r\nwhich was loaded with silver and gold, melted, and threw up these metals\r\nto the surface, forasmuch as every mountain and wooded hill seemed to be\r\nheaped up with money by a lavish fortune. Altogether (he remarks) any\r\none seeing these places, could only describe them as the inexhaustible\r\ntreasuries of nature, or the unfailing exchequer of some potentate; for\r\nnot only, he tells us, is this land rich itself, but riches abound\r\nbeneath it. So that amongst these people the subterraneous regions\r\nshould not be regarded as the realms of Pluto, but of Plutus. Such is\r\nthe flourished style in which he speaks on this subject, that you would\r\nfancy his turgid language had been dug from a mine itself. Discoursing\r\non the diligence of the miners, he applies to them the remark [of\r\nDemetrius] of Phalaris, who, speaking of the silver mines of Attica,\r\nsaid that the men there dug with as much energy as if they thought they\r\ncould grub up Plutus himself. He compares with these the activity and\r\ndiligence of the Turdetani, who are in the habit of cutting tortuous and\r\ndeep tunnels, and draining the streams which they frequently encounter\r\nby means of Egyptian screws.[1078] As for the rest,[1079] they are quite\r\ndifferent from the Attic miners, whose mining (he remarks) may be justly\r\ncompared to that enigma,[1080] What I have taken up I have not kept, and\r\nwhat I have got I have thrown away. Whereas the Turdetanians make a good\r\nprofit, since a fourth part of the ore which they extract from the\r\ncopper mines is [pure] copper, while from the silver mines one person\r\nhas taken as much as a Eubœan talent. He says that tin is not found upon\r\nthe surface, as authors commonly relate, but that it is dug up; and that\r\nit is produced both in places among the barbarians who dwell beyond the\r\nLusitanians and in the islands Cassiterides; and that from the Britannic\r\nIslands it is carried to Marseilles. Amongst the Artabri,[1081] who are\r\nthe last of the Lusitanians towards the north and west, he tells us that\r\nthe earth is powdered with silver, tin, and white gold, that is, mixed\r\nwith silver, the earth having been brought down by the rivers: this the\r\nwomen scrape up with spades, and wash in sieves, woven after the fashion\r\nof baskets. Such is the [CAS. 147] substance of what [Posidonius] tells\r\nus concerning the mines [of Iberia].\r\n\r\n10. Polybius, speaking of the silver mines of New Carthage,[1082] tells\r\nus that they are extremely large, distant from the city about 20 stadia,\r\nand occupy a circuit of 400 stadia, that there are 40,000 men regularly\r\nengaged in them, and that they yield daily to the Roman people [a\r\nrevenue of] 25,000 drachmæ. The rest of the process I pass over, as it\r\nis too long, but as for the silver ore collected, he tells us that it is\r\nbroken up, and sifted through sieves over water; that what remains is to\r\nbe again broken, and the water having been strained off, it is to be\r\nsifted and broken a third time. The dregs which remain after the fifth\r\ntime are to be melted, and the lead being poured off, the silver is\r\nobtained pure. These silver mines still exist; however they are no\r\nlonger the property of the state, neither these nor those elsewhere, but\r\nare possessed by private individuals. The gold mines, on the contrary,\r\nnearly all belong to the state. Both at Castlon[1083] and other places\r\nthere are singular lead mines worked. They contain a small proportion of\r\nsilver, but not sufficient to pay for the expense of refining.\r\n\r\n11. Not far from Castlon is the mountain in which they report that the\r\n[river] Guadalquiver[1084] takes its rise. They call it silver mountain\r\non account of the silver mines which it contains.[1085] Polybius asserts\r\nthat both the Guadiana[1086] and this river have their sources in\r\nKeltiberia, notwithstanding they are separated from each other by a\r\ndistance of 900 stadia;[1087] [this we are to attribute to] the\r\nKeltiberians having increased in power, and having consequently\r\nconferred their name on the surrounding country. It appears the ancients\r\nknew the Guadalquiver under the name of the Tartessus, and Gades[1088]\r\nwith the neighbouring islands under that of Erythia; and it is thought\r\nthat we should understand in this sense the words of Stesichorus[1089]\r\nconcerning the pastoral poet Geryon, that he was born “almost opposite\r\nto the renowned Erythia, in a rocky cave near to the abundant springs of\r\nthe silver-bedded river Tartessus.” They say that on the piece of land\r\nenclosed between the two outlets of this river there formerly stood a\r\ncity named, like the river, Tartessus, and that the district was called\r\nTartessis, which the Turduli now inhabit. Eratosthenes likewise tells us\r\nthat the [country] near to Calpe[1090] was called Tartessis, and also\r\nErythia the Fortunate Island. This Artemidorus contradicts, and says\r\nthat it is as false as his other statements, that the Sacred\r\nPromontory[1091] is distant from Gades[1092] five days’ sail, when in\r\nfact they are [distant from each other] not more than 1700 stadia.[1093]\r\nLikewise that the tide ceased at this point, whereas it passes round the\r\nwhole circuit of the habitable earth. That it is easier to pass from the\r\nnorthern parts of Iberia into Keltica,[1094] than to proceed thither by\r\nsea; with many other things which he asserted on the faith of that\r\ncharlatan Pytheas.\r\n\r\n12. Our poet [Homer] being very explicit, and possessing great\r\nexperience, gives one cause to believe that he was not unfamiliar with\r\nthese localities. Of this any one may be convinced who will examine\r\ncarefully what has been written on these points, both the incorrect\r\n[comments], and likewise those which are better and more truthful. One\r\namongst these incorrect ideas is, that he considered [Tartessis] to be\r\nthe farthest country towards the west, where, as he himself expresses\r\nit,\r\n\r\n         The radiant sun in ocean sank,\r\n   Drawing night after him o’er all the earth.[1095]\r\n\r\nNow, since it is evident that night is ominous, and near to Hades, and\r\nHades to Tartarus, it seems probable that [Homer], having heard of\r\nTartessus, took thence the name of Tartarus to distinguish the farthest\r\nof the places beneath the earth, also embellishing it with fable in\r\nvirtue of the poetic licence. In the same way, knowing that the\r\nCimmerians dwelt in northern and dismal territories near to the\r\nBosphorus, he located them [CAS. 149] in the vicinity of Hades; perhaps\r\nalso on account of the common hatred of the Ionians against this people.\r\nFor they say that in the time of Homer, or a little before, the\r\nCimmerians made an incursion as far as Æolia and Ionia. Always drawing\r\nhis fables from certain real facts, his Planetæ[1096] are modelled on\r\nthe Cyaneæ. He describes them as dangerous rocks, as they tell us the\r\nCyaneæan rocks are, [and] on which account [in fact] they are called\r\nSymplegades.[1097] He adds to this [the account of] Jason’s navigating\r\nthrough the midst of them. The Straits of the Pillars[1098] and\r\nSicily,[1099] likewise, suggested to him the fable of the Planetæ. Thus,\r\neven according to the worst comments, from the fiction of Tartarus any\r\none might gather that Homer was acquainted with the regions about\r\nTartessus.\r\n\r\n13. Of these facts, notwithstanding, there are better proofs. For\r\ninstance, the expeditions of Hercules and the Phœnicians to this country\r\nwere evidence to him of the wealth and luxury of the people. They fell\r\nso entirely under the dominion of the Phœnicians, that at the present\r\nday almost the whole of the cities of Turdetania and the neighbouring\r\nplaces are inhabited by them. It also seems to me that the expedition of\r\nUlysses hither, as it took place and was recorded, was the foundation\r\nboth of his Odyssey and Iliad, which he framed upon facts collected into\r\na poem, and embellished as usual with poetical mythology. It is not only\r\nin Italy, Sicily, and a few other places that vestiges of these [events]\r\noccur; even in Iberia a city is shown named Ulyssea,[1100] also a temple\r\nof Minerva, and a myriad other traces both of the wandering of Ulysses\r\nand also of other survivors of the Trojan war, which was equally fatal\r\nto the vanquished and those who took Troy. These latter in fact gained a\r\nCadmean victory,[1101] for their homes were destroyed, and the portion\r\nof booty which fell to each was exceedingly minute. Consequently not\r\nonly those who had survived the perils [of their country], but the\r\nGreeks as well, betook themselves to piracy, the former because they\r\nhad been pillaged of every thing; the latter, on account of the shame\r\nwhich each one anticipated to himself:\r\n\r\n                       “The shame\r\n   That must attend us, after absence long\r\n   Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?”[1102]\r\n\r\nIn the same way is related the wandering of Æneas, of Antenor, and of\r\nthe Heneti; likewise of Diomedes, of Menelaus, of Ulysses,[1103] and of\r\nmany others. Hence the poet, knowing of similar expeditions to the\r\nextremities of Iberia, and having heard of its wealth and other\r\nexcellencies, (which the Phœnicians had made known,) feigned this to be\r\nthe region of the Blessed, and the Plain of Elysium, where Proteus\r\ninforms Menelaus that he is to depart to:\r\n\r\n             “But far hence the gods\r\n   Will send thee to Elysium, and the earth’s\r\n   Extremest bounds; there Rhadamanthus dwells,\r\n   The golden-haired, and there the human kind\r\n   Enjoy the easiest life; no snow is there,\r\n   No biting winter, and no drenching shower,\r\n   But zephyr always gently from the sea\r\n   Breathes on them to refresh the happy race.”[1104]\r\n\r\nNow the purity of the air, and the gentle breathing of the zephyr, are\r\nboth applicable to this country, as well as the softness of the climate,\r\nits position in the west, and its place at the extremities of the earth,\r\nwhere, as we have said, he feigned that Hades was. By coupling\r\nRhadamanthus with it, he signifies that the place was near to Minos, of\r\nwhom he says,\r\n\r\n   “There saw I Minos, offspring famed of Jove;\r\n   His golden sceptre in his hand, he sat\r\n   Judge of the dead.”[1105]\r\n\r\nSimilar to these are the fables related by later poets; such, for\r\ninstance, as the expeditions after the oxen of Geryon, and the [CAS.\r\n150] golden apples of the Hesperides, the Islands of the Blessed[1106]\r\nthey speak of, which we know are still pointed out to us not far distant\r\nfrom the extremities of Maurusia, and opposite to Gades.\r\n\r\n14. I repeat that the Phœnicians were the discoverers [of these\r\ncountries], for they possessed the better part of Iberia and Libya\r\nbefore the time of Homer, and continued masters of those places until\r\ntheir empire was overthrown by the Romans. This also is an evidence of\r\nthe wealth of Iberia: in the expedition of the Carthaginians under\r\nBarcas,[1107] they found, according to historians, that the people of\r\nTurdetania used silver goblets[1108] and casks. One might guess too that\r\nit was on account of this great opulence that the men of the country,\r\nand their chiefs in particular, were styled long-lived. Wherefore\r\nAnacreon thus sings,\r\n\r\n   “Neither would I desire the horn of Amalthea, nor to reign over\r\n   Tartessus one hundred and fifty years.”\r\n\r\nHerodotus too has preserved the name of the king, whom he calls\r\nArganthonius.[1109] The passage of Anacreon must therefore either be\r\nunderstood [of this king], or some other like him; or else more\r\ngenerally thus, “nor to reign for a lengthened period in Tartessus.”\r\nSome writers[1110] are of opinion that Tartessus is the present Carteia.\r\n\r\n15. The Turdetani not only enjoy a salubrious climate but their manners\r\nare polished and urbane, as also are those of the people of Keltica, by\r\nreason of their vicinity [to the Turdetani], or, according to Polybius,\r\non account of their being of the same stock, but not to so great a\r\ndegree, for they live for the most part scattered in villages. The\r\nTurdetani, on the other hand, especially those who dwell about the\r\nGuadalquiver,[1111] have so entirely adopted the Roman mode of life, as\r\neven to have forgotten their own language. They have for the most part\r\nbecome Latins,[1112] and received Roman colonists; so that a short time\r\nonly is wanted before they will be all Romans. The very names of many of\r\nthe towns at present, such as Pax Augusta[1113] amongst the Keltici,\r\nAugusta-Emerita[1114] amongst the Turduli, Cæsar-Augusta[1115] amongst\r\nthe Keltiberians and certain other colonies, are proof of the change of\r\nmanners I have spoken of. Those of the Iberians who adopt these new\r\nmodes of life are styled _togati_. Amongst their number are the\r\nKeltiberians, who formerly were regarded as the most uncivilized of them\r\nall. So much for these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Starting again from the Sacred Promontory,[1116] and continuing along\r\nthe other side of the coast, we come to the gulf near the Tagus,\r\nafterwards Cape Barbarium,[1117] and near to this the outlets of the\r\nTagus, which may be reached by sailing in a straight course for a\r\ndistance of 10 stadia.[1118] Here are estuaries, one of them more than\r\n400 stadia from the said tower, on a part of which Laccæa is\r\nsituated.[1119] The breadth of the mouth of the Tagus is about 20\r\nstadia, its depth is so great as to be capable of navigation by vessels\r\nof the greatest burden. At the flood-tide the Tagus forms two estuaries\r\nin the [CAS. 152] plains which lie above it, so that the plain is\r\ninundated and rendered navigable for a distance of 150 stadia. In the\r\nupper estuary an island is formed about 30 stadia in length, and nearly\r\nequal in breadth, which is fertile, and has excellent vines. The island\r\nlies near to Moro,[1120] a city happily situated on a mountain close to\r\nthe river, and about 500 stadia from the sea. The country surrounding it\r\nis very fine, and the ascent [of the Tagus] for a considerable way\r\npracticable for vessels of a large size, the remainder is performed in\r\nriver-boats. Above Moro it is navigable for a yet longer distance.\r\nBrutus, surnamed the Gallician, made use of this city as a military\r\nstation, when fighting against the Lusitanians, whom he subdued. On the\r\nsides of the river he fortified Olysipo, in order that the passage up\r\nthe river and the carriage of necessaries might be preserved unimpeded.\r\nThese therefore are the finest cities near the Tagus. The river contains\r\nmuch fish, and is full of oysters. It takes its rise amongst the\r\nKeltiberians, and flows through the [country of the] Vettones,\r\nCarpetani, and Lusitani, towards the west;[1121] to a certain distance\r\nit runs parallel with the Guadiana[1122] and Guadalquiver,[1123] but\r\nparts from them as they decline towards the southern coast.\r\n\r\n2. Of those who dwell above the aforesaid mountains, the Oretani are the\r\nmost southern, extending in part as far as the sea-coast on this side\r\nthe Pillars. Next these towards the north are the Carpetani, then the\r\nVettones and Vaccæi, through whose [country] the Douro[1124] flows as it\r\npasses Acontia,[1125] a city of the Vaccæi. The Gallicians are the last,\r\nand inhabit for the most part a mountainous country: on this account\r\nthey were the most difficult to subdue, and furnished his surname to the\r\nconqueror of the Lusitanians; in fact, at the present day the greater\r\npart of the Lusitanians are beginning to call themselves Gallicians. The\r\nfinest cities of Oretania are Castulo[1126] and Oria.[1127]\r\n\r\n3. North of the Tagus is Lusitania, the principal of the nations of\r\nIberia, and the one which has most frequently encountered the arms of\r\nthe Romans. On the southern side this country is bounded by the Tagus,\r\non the west and north by the ocean, on the east by the well-known\r\nnations of the Carpetani, the Vettones, the Vaccæi, the Gallicians, and\r\nby others not worthy to be mentioned on account of their insignificance\r\nand obscurity. On the other hand, certain historians of the present day\r\ngive the name of Lusitanians to all of these nations.\r\n\r\nTo the east the Gallicians border on the nation of the Asturians and\r\nKeltiberians, the others [border] on the Keltiberians. In length\r\nLusitania is 3000[1128] stadia; its breadth, which is comprised between\r\nthe eastern side and the opposite sea-coast, is much less. The eastern\r\npart is mountainous and rugged, while the country beyond, as far as the\r\nsea, consists entirely of plains, with the exception of a few\r\ninconsiderable mountains. On this account Posidonius remarks that\r\nAristotle was not correct in supposing that the ebb and flow of the tide\r\nwas occasioned by the sea-coast of Iberia and Maurusia.[1129] For\r\nAristotle asserted that the tides of the sea were caused by the\r\nextremities of the land being mountainous and rugged, and therefore both\r\nreceiving the wave violently and also casting it back. Whereas\r\nPosidonius truly remarks that they are for the most part low and sandy.\r\n\r\n4. The country which we are describing is fertile, and irrigated by\r\nrivers both large and small, all of which flow from the eastern parts\r\nparallel with the Tagus: most of them are navigable and full of gold\r\ndust. After the Tagus, the most noted rivers are the Mondego[1130] and\r\nthe Vouga,[1131] which are navigable but for a short distance. After\r\nthese is the Douro,[1132] which flows from afar by Numantia,[1133] and\r\nmany other colonies of the Keltiberians and Vaccæi; it is capable of\r\nbeing navigated in large vessels for a distance of nearly 800 stadia.\r\nBesides these there are other rivers, after which is the [river] of\r\nLethe, which some call the Limæa,[1134] others the Belio,[1135] it\r\nlikewise rises amongst the Keltiberians and Vaccæi. After [CAS. 153]\r\nthis is the Bænis, (some call it the Minius,[1136]) by far the largest\r\nriver of Lusitania,[1137] being navigable for a distance of 800 stadia.\r\nPosidonius says this too rises amongst the Cantabrians.[1138] An\r\nisland[1139] lies before its outlet, and two moles affording anchorage\r\nfor vessels. A natural advantage [of this country] well deserving of\r\ncommendation is, that the banks of the rivers are so lofty as to be\r\ncapable of containing the entirety of the water raised by the high tides\r\nof the sea, without either being overfilled, or overflowing the plains.\r\nThis was the limit of Brutus’s expedition. Beyond there are many other\r\nrivers parallel to those I have named.\r\n\r\n5. The Artabri are the last of the people [on this coast]. They inhabit\r\nthe promontory called Nerium,[1140] which is the boundary [of Iberia] on\r\nits western and northern sides. Around it dwell the Keltici, a kindred\r\nrace to those who are situated along the Guadiana.[1141] They say that\r\nthese latter, together with the Turduli, having undertaken an expedition\r\nthither, quarrelled after they had crossed the river Lima,[1142] and,\r\nbesides the sedition, their leader having also died, they remained\r\nscattered there, and from this circumstance the river was called the\r\nLethe.[1143] The Artabri have besides many cities established round the\r\nGulf, which mariners and those familiar with the places designate as the\r\nPort of the Artabri. At the present day the Artabri are denominated the\r\nArotrebæ. About thirty[1144] different nations occupy the country\r\nbetween the Tagus and the Artabri. Notwithstanding the fertility of the\r\ncountry in corn, cattle, gold, silver, and numerous other similar\r\nproductions, the majority of its inhabitants, neglecting to gain their\r\nsubsistence from the ground, passed their lives in pillage and continual\r\nwarfare, both between themselves and their neighbours, whom they used to\r\ncross the Tagus [to plunder]. To this the Romans at length put a stop by\r\nsubduing them, and changing many of their cities into villages, besides\r\ncolonizing some of them better. The mountaineers, as was natural, were\r\nthe first to commence this lawless mode of life: for living but\r\nscantily, and possessing little, they coveted the goods of others, who\r\nbeing obliged to repulse them, of necessity relinquished their proper\r\nemployments, and instead of pursuing agriculture took up arms. Thus it\r\nhappened that their country, being neglected, became barren\r\nnotwithstanding its natural advantages, and inhabited by bandits.\r\n\r\n6. The Lusitanians are reported to be clever in laying ambushes, sharp,\r\nswift of foot, light,[1145] and easily disciplined as soldiers. The\r\nsmall shield they make use of is two feet in diameter, its outer surface\r\nconcave, and suspended by leather thongs; it neither has rings nor\r\nhandles. They have in addition[1146] a poignard or dagger. Their\r\ncorselets are for the most part made of linen; a few have chain-coats\r\nand helmets with triple crests, but the others use helmets composed of\r\nsinews. The infantry wear greaves, each man is furnished with a number\r\nof javelins; some also use spears pointed with brass. They report that\r\nsome of those who dwell near to the river Douro[1147] imitate the\r\nLacedæmonians in anointing their bodies with oil, using hot air-baths\r\nmade of heated stones, bathing in cold water, and taking but one tidy\r\nand frugal meal a day. The Lusitanians are frequent in the performance\r\nof sacrifice; they examine the entrails, but without cutting them out of\r\nthe body; they also examine the veins of the side, and practise augury\r\nby the touch. They likewise divine by the entrails of captive enemies,\r\nwhom they first cover with a military cloak, and when stricken under the\r\nentrails by the haruspex, they draw their first auguries from the fall\r\n[of the victim]. [CAS. 155] They cut off the right hands of their\r\nprisoners, and consecrate them to the gods.\r\n\r\n7. All the mountaineers are frugal, their beverage is water, they sleep\r\non the ground, and wear a profuse quantity of long hair after the\r\nfashion of women, which they bind around the forehead when they go to\r\nbattle.[1148] They subsist principally on the flesh of the goat, which\r\nanimal they sacrifice to Mars, as also prisoners taken in war, and\r\nhorses. They likewise offer hecatombs of each kind after the manner of\r\nthe Greeks, described by Pindar,\r\n\r\n   “To sacrifice a hundred of every [species].”[1149]\r\n\r\nThey practise gymnastic exercises,[1150] both as heavy-armed soldiers,\r\nand cavalry, also boxing, running, skirmishing, and fighting in bands.\r\nFor two-thirds of the year the mountaineers feed on the acorn, which\r\nthey dry, bruise, and afterwards grind and make into a kind of bread,\r\nwhich may be stored up for a long period. They also use beer; wine is\r\nvery scarce, and what is made they speedily consume in feasting with\r\ntheir relatives. In place of oil they use butter. Their meals they take\r\nsitting, on seats put up round the walls, and they take place on these\r\naccording to their age and rank. The supper is carried round, and whilst\r\ndrinking they dance to the sound of the flute and trumpet, springing up\r\nand sinking upon the knees.[1151]\r\n\r\nIn Bastetania the women dance promiscuously with the men, each holding\r\nthe other’s hand. They all dress in black, the majority of them in\r\ncloaks called saga, in which they sleep on beds of straw. They make use\r\nof wooden vessels like the Kelts. The women wear dresses and embroidered\r\ngarments. Instead of money, those who dwell far in the interior exchange\r\nmerchandise, or give pieces of silver cut off from plates of that\r\nmetal. Those condemned to death are executed by stoning; parricides are\r\nput to death without the frontiers or the cities. They marry according\r\nto the customs of the Greeks.[1152] Their sick they expose upon the\r\nhighways, the same way as the Egyptians[1153] did anciently, in the hope\r\nthat some one who has experienced the malady may be able to give them\r\nadvice. Up to the time of [the expedition of] Brutus they made use of\r\nvessels constructed of skins for crossing the lagoons formed by the\r\ntides; they now have them formed out of the single trunk of a tree, but\r\nthese are scarce. Their salt is purple, but becomes white by pounding.\r\nThe life of the mountaineers is such as I have described, I mean those\r\nbordering the northern side of Iberia, the Gallicians, the Asturians,\r\nand the Cantabrians,[1154] as far as the Vascons[1155] and the Pyrenees.\r\nThe mode of life amongst all these is similar. But I am reluctant to\r\nfill my page with their names, and would fain escape the disagreeable\r\ntask of writing them, unless perchance the Pleutauri, the Bardyetæ, the\r\nAllotriges,[1156] and other names still worse and more out of the way\r\nthan these might be grateful to the ear of some one.\r\n\r\n8. The rough and savage manners of these people is not alone owing to\r\ntheir wars, but likewise to their isolated position, it being a long\r\ndistance to reach them, whether by sea or land. Thus the difficulty of\r\ncommunication has deprived [CAS. 156] them both of generosity of manners\r\nand of courtesy. At the present time, however, they suffer less from\r\nthis both on account of their being at peace and the intermixture of\r\nRomans. Wherever these [influences] are not so much experienced people\r\nare harsher and more savage. It is probable that this ruggedness of\r\ncharacter is increased by the barrenness of the mountains and some of\r\nthe places which they inhabit. At the present day, as I have remarked,\r\nall warfare is put an end to, Augustus Cæsar having subdued the\r\nCantabrians[1157] and the neighbouring nations, amongst whom the system\r\nof pillage was mainly carried on in our day. So that at the present\r\ntime, instead of plundering the allies of the Romans, the Coniaci and\r\nthose who dwell by the sources of the Ebro,[1158] with the exception of\r\nthe Tuisi,[1159] bear arms for the Romans. Tiberius, who succeeded\r\nAugustus Cæsar, carried out his intention of placing a military force of\r\nthree legions in these parts, by which means he has not only preserved\r\npeace, but introduced amongst some of them a civil polity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What remains [to be described] of Iberia, is the sea-coast of the\r\nMediterranean from the Pillars to the Pyrenees, and the whole of the\r\ninland country which lies above. The breadth of this is irregular, its\r\nlength a little above 4000 stadia. It has been remarked that the\r\nsea-coast[1160] is above 2000 stadia, and they say that from Mount\r\nCalpe,[1161] which is near the Pillars, to New Carthage,[1162] there are\r\n2200 stadia. This coast is inhabited by the Bastetani, also called the\r\nBastuli, and in part by the Oretani. Thence[1163] to the Ebro the\r\ndistance is nearly as great. This [region] is inhabited by the Edetani.\r\nOn this side the Ebro to the Pyrenees and the Trophies of Pompey there\r\nare 1600 stadia. It is peopled by a small portion of the Edetani, and\r\nthe rest by a people named the Indicetes, divided into four cantons.\r\n\r\n2. Commencing our particular description from Calpe, there is [first]\r\nthe mountain-chain of Bastetania and the Oretani. This is covered\r\nwith thick woods and gigantic trees, and separates the sea-coast from\r\nthe interior. In many places it also contains gold and other mines. The\r\nfirst city along the coast is Malaca,[1164] which is about as far\r\ndistant from Calpe as Calpe is from Gades.[1165] It is a market for the\r\nnomade tribes from the opposite coast, and there are great stores of\r\nsalt-fish there. Some suppose it to be the same as Mænaca, which\r\ntradition reports to be the farthest west of the cities of the Phocæi;\r\nbut this is not the case, for Mænaca, which was situated at a greater\r\ndistance from Calpe, is in ruins, and preserves traces of having been a\r\nGrecian city, whereas Malaca is nearer, and Phœnician in its\r\nconfiguration. Next in order is the city of the Exitani,[1166] from\r\nwhich the salted fish[1167] bearing that name takes its appellation.\r\n\r\n3. After these comes Abdera,[1168] founded likewise by the Phœnicians.\r\nAbove these places, in the mountains, the city of Ulyssea[1169] is\r\nshown, containing a temple to Minerva, according to the testimony of\r\nPosidonius, Artemidorus, and Asclepiades the Myrlean,[1170] a man who\r\ntaught literature in Turdetania, and published a description of the\r\nnations dwelling there. He says that in the temple of Minerva were hung\r\nup spears and prows of vessels, monuments of the wanderings [CAS. 157]\r\nof Ulysses. That some of those who followed Teucer in his expedition\r\nsettled among the Gallicians;[1171] and that two cities were there, the\r\none called Hellenes,[1172] the other Amphilochi; but Amphilochus[1173]\r\nhaving died, his followers wandered into the interior. He adds, that it\r\nis said, that some of the followers of Hercules, and certain also of the\r\ninhabitants of Messene, settled in Iberia. Both he and others assert\r\nthat a portion of Cantabria was occupied by Laconians. Here is the city\r\nnamed Opsicella,[1174] founded by Ocela,[1175] who passed into Italy\r\nwith Antenor and his children. Some believe the account of the merchants\r\nof Gades, asserted by Artemidorus, that in Libya there are people living\r\nabove Maurusia, near to the Western Ethiopians, named Lotophagi, because\r\nthey feed on the leaves and root of the lotus[1176] without wanting to\r\ndrink; for they possess [no drink], being without water. These people\r\nthey say extend as far as the regions above Cyrene. There are others\r\nalso called Lotophagi, who inhabit Meninx,[1177] one of the islands\r\nsituated opposite the Lesser Syrtes.[1178]\r\n\r\n4. No one should be surprised that the poet, in his fiction descriptive\r\nof the wanderings of Ulysses, should have located the majority of the\r\nscenes which he narrates without the Pillars, in the Atlantic. For\r\nhistorical events of a similar character did actually occur near to the\r\nplaces, so that the other circumstances which he feigned did not make\r\nhis fiction incredible; nor [should any one be surprised] if certain\r\npersons, putting faith in the historical accuracy and extensive\r\nknowledge of the poet, should have attempted to explain the poem of\r\nHomer on scientific principles; a proceeding undertaken by Crates of\r\nMallos,[1179] and some others. On the other hand, there have been those\r\nwho have treated the undertaking of Homer so contemptuously, as not only\r\nto deny any such knowledge to the poet, as though he were a ditcher or\r\nreaper, but have stigmatized as fools those who commented on his\r\nwritings. And not one either of the grammarians, or of those skilled in\r\nthe mathematics, has dared to undertake their defence, or to set right\r\nany mistakes in what they have advanced, or any thing else; although it\r\nseems to me possible both to prove correct much that they have said, and\r\nalso to set right other points, especially where they have been misled\r\nby putting faith in Pytheas, who was ignorant of the countries situated\r\nalong the ocean, both to the west and north. But we must let these\r\nmatters pass, as they require a particular and lengthened discussion.\r\n\r\n5. The settlement of the Grecians amongst these barbarous nations may be\r\nregarded as the result of the division of these latter into small tribes\r\nand sovereignties, having on account of their moroseness no union\r\namongst themselves, and therefore powerless against attacks from\r\nwithout. This moroseness is remarkably prevalent amongst the Iberians,\r\nwho are [CAS. 158] besides crafty in their manner, devoid of sincerity,\r\ninsidious, and predatory in their mode of life; they are bold in little\r\nadventures, but never undertake any thing of magnitude, inasmuch as they\r\nhave never formed any extended power or confederacy. If they had had but\r\nthe will to assist each other, neither could the Carthaginians by making\r\nan incursion have so easily deprived them of the greater part of their\r\ncountry, nor before them the Tyrians, then the Kelts, now called the\r\nKeltiberians and Berones, nor after these the brigand Viriathus, and\r\nSertorius,[1180] nor any others who desired power. On this account the\r\nRomans, having carried the war into Iberia, lost much time by reason of\r\nthe number of different sovereignties, having to conquer first one, then\r\nanother; in fact, it occupied nearly two centuries, or even longer,\r\nbefore they had subdued the whole.—I return to my description.\r\n\r\n6. After Abdera[1181] is New Carthage,[1182] founded by Asdrubal, who\r\nsucceeded Barcas, the father of Hannibal. It is by far the most powerful\r\ncity of this country, being impregnable, and furnished with a noble\r\nwall, harbours, and a lake, besides the silver mines already mentioned.\r\nThe places in the vicinity have an abundance of salted fish, and it is\r\nbesides the great emporium of the sea merchandise for the interior, and\r\nlikewise for the merchandise from the interior for exportation. About\r\nmidway along the coast between this city and the Ebro, we meet with the\r\noutlet of the river Xucar,[1183] and a city bearing the same name.[1184]\r\nIt rises in a mountain belonging to the chain which overlooks\r\nMalaca,[1185] and the regions around Carthage, and may be forded on\r\nfoot; it is nearly parallel to the Ebro, but not quite so far distant\r\nfrom Carthage as from the Ebro. Between the Xucar and Carthage are three\r\nsmall towns of the people of Marseilles, not far from the river. Of\r\nthese the best known is Hemeroscopium.[1186] On the promontory there is\r\na temple to Diana of Ephesus, held in great veneration. Sertorius used\r\nit as an arsenal, convenient to the sea, both on account of its being\r\nfortified and fitted for piratical uses, and because it is visible from\r\na great distance to vessels approaching. It is called Dianium,[1187]\r\nfrom Diana. Near to it are some fine iron-works, and two small islands,\r\nPlanesia[1188] and Plumbaria,[1189] with a sea-water lake lying above,\r\nof 400 stadia in circumference. Next is the island of Hercules, near to\r\nCarthage, and called Scombraria,[1190] on account of the mackerel taken\r\nthere, from which the finest garum[1191] is made. It is distant 24\r\nstadia from Carthage. On the other side of the Xucar, going towards the\r\noutlet of the Ebro, is Saguntum, founded by the Zacynthians. The\r\ndestruction of this city by Hannibal, contrary to his treaties with the\r\nRomans, kindled the second Punic war. Near to it are the cities of\r\nCherronesus,[1192] Oleastrum, and Cartalia, and the colony of\r\nDertossa,[1193] on the very passage of the Ebro. The Ebro takes its\r\nsource amongst the Cantabrians; it flows through an extended plain\r\ntowards the south, running parallel with the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n7. The first city between the windings of the Ebro and the extremities\r\nof the Pyrenees, near to where the Trophies of Pompey are erected, is\r\nTarraco;[1194] it has no harbour, but is situated on a bay, and\r\npossessed of many other advantages. At the present day it is as well\r\npeopled as Carthage;[1195] for it is admirably suited for the stay of\r\nthe prefects,[1196] and is as it were the metropolis, not only of [the\r\ncountry lying] on this side the Ebro, but also of a great part of what\r\nlies beyond. The near vicinity of the Gymnesian Islands,[1197] and\r\nEbusus,[1198] which are all of considerable importance, are sufficient\r\nto inform one of the felicitous position of the city. Eratosthenes tells\r\nus that it has a roadstead, but Artemidorus contradicts this, and\r\naffirms that it scarcely possesses an anchorage.\r\n\r\n8. The whole coast from the Pillars up to this place wants harbours, but\r\nall the way from here to Emporium,[1199] the countries of the Leëtani,\r\nthe Lartolæetæ, and others, are both furnished with excellent harbours\r\nand fertile. Emporium was founded by the people of Marseilles, and is\r\nabout 4000[1200] stadia [CAS. 160] distant from the Pyrenees, and the\r\nconfines of Iberia and Keltica. This is a very fine region, and\r\npossesses good ports. Here also is Rhodope,[1201] a small town of the\r\nEmporitæ, but some say it was founded by the Rhodians. Both here and in\r\nEmporium they reverence the Ephesian Diana. The cause of this we will\r\nexplain when we come to speak of Massalia.[1202] In former times the\r\nEmporitæ dwelt on a small island opposite, now called the old city, but\r\nat the present day they inhabit the mainland. The city is double, being\r\ndivided by a wall, for in past times some of the Indiceti dwelt close\r\nby, who, although they had a separate polity to themselves, desired, for\r\nthe sake of safety, to be shut in by a common enclosure with the\r\nGrecians; but at the same time that this enclosure should be two-fold,\r\nbeing divided through its middle by a wall. In time, however, they came\r\nto have but one government, a mixture of Barbarian and Grecian laws; a\r\nresult which has taken place in many other [states].\r\n\r\n9. A river[1203] flows near to it, which has its sources in the\r\nPyrenees; its outlet forms a port for the Emporitæ, who are skilful\r\nworkers in flax. Of the interior of their country some parts are\r\nfertile, others covered with spartum, a rush which flourishes in\r\nmarshes, and is entirely useless: they call this the Junc Plain. There\r\nare some who inhabit the Pyrenean mountains as far as the Trophies of\r\nPompey, on the route which leads from Italy into Ulterior Iberia,[1204]\r\nand particularly into Bætica. This road runs sometimes close to the sea,\r\nsometimes at a distance therefrom, particularly in the western parts.\r\nFrom the Trophies of Pompey it leads to Tarraco,[1205] through the Junc\r\nPlain, the Betteres,[1206] and the plain called in the Latin tongue [the\r\nplain] of Marathon, on account of the quantity of fennel growing there.\r\nFrom Tarraco [the road runs] towards the passage of the Ebro at the city\r\nof Dertossa;[1207] from thence having traversed the city of\r\nSaguntum,[1208] and Setabis,[1209] it follows a course more and more\r\ndistant from the sea, till it approaches the Plain of Spartarium, which\r\nsignifies the Plain of Rushes. This is a vast arid plain, producing the\r\nspecies of rush from which cords are made, and which are exported to all\r\nparts, but particularly to Italy.[1210] Formerly the road passed on\r\nthrough the midst of the plain, and [the city of] Egelastæ,[1211] which\r\nwas both difficult and long, but they have now constructed a new road\r\nclose to the sea, which merely touches upon the Plain of Rushes, and\r\nleads to the same places as the former, [viz.] Castlon,[1212] and\r\nObulco,[1213] through which runs the road to Corduba and Gades,[1214]\r\nthe two greatest emporia [of Iberia]. Obulco is distant about 300 stadia\r\nfrom Corduba. Historians report that Cæsar came from Rome to Obulco, and\r\nto his army there, within the space of twenty-seven days, when about to\r\nfight the battle of Munda.[1215]\r\n\r\n10. Such is the whole sea-coast from the Pillars to the confines of the\r\nIberians and Kelts. The interior of the country lying above, and\r\nincluded between the mountains of the Pyrenees and the northern side [of\r\nIberia], as far as the Astures, is principally divided by two mountain\r\nchains; the one of these is parallel to the Pyrenees, and takes its\r\ncommencement from the country of the Cantabri, terminating at the\r\nMediterranean. This is called the Idubeda.[1216] The second, springing\r\nfrom the middle [of this first], runs towards the west, inclining\r\nhowever to the south and the sea-coast towards the Pillars. At the\r\ncommencement it consists of bare hills, but after traversing the Plain\r\nof Spartarium, falls in with the forest lying above Carthage,[1217] and\r\nthe regions round Malaca.[1218] It is named Orospeda.[1219] The river\r\nEbro flows between the Pyrenees and Idubeda, and parallel to both these\r\nmountains. It is fed by the rivers and other waters carried down [CAS.\r\n161] from [the mountains]. Situated on the Ebro is the city of Cæsar\r\nAugusta,[1220] and the colony of Celsa,[1221] where there is a stone\r\nbridge across the river. This country is inhabited by many nations, the\r\nbest known being that of the Jaccetani.[1222] Commencing at the foot of\r\nthe Pyrenees, it widens out into the plains, and reaches to the\r\ndistricts around Ilerda[1223] and Osca,[1224] [cities] of the Ilergetes\r\nnot far distant from the Ebro. It was in these cities, and in\r\nCalaguris,[1225] a city of the Gascons, as well as those of\r\nTarraco[1226] and Hemeroscopium,[1227] situated on the coast, that\r\nSertorius sustained the last efforts of the war, after being ejected\r\nfrom the country of the Keltiberians. He died at Osca, and it was near\r\nto Ilerda that Afranius and Petreius, Pompey’s generals, were afterwards\r\ndefeated by divus[1228] Cæsar. Herda is distant 160 stadia from the\r\nEbro, which is on its west, about 460 from Tarraco, which is on the\r\nsouth, and 540 from Osca, which lies to the north.[1229] Passing through\r\nthese places from Tarraco to the extremities of the Vascons who dwell by\r\nthe ocean, near Pompelon[1230] and the city of Œaso[1231] situated on\r\nthe ocean, the route extends 2400 stadia, to the very frontiers of\r\nAquitaine and Iberia. It was in the country of the Jaccetani that\r\nSertorius fought against Pompey, and here afterwards Sextus, Pompey’s\r\nson, fought against the generals of Cæsar. The nation of the Vascons, in\r\nwhich is Pompelon, or Pompey’s city, lies north of Jaccetania.\r\n\r\n11. The side of the Pyrenees next Iberia is covered with forests\r\ncontaining numerous kinds of trees and evergreens, whilst the side next\r\nKeltica is bare: in the midst [the mountains] enclose valleys admirably\r\nfitted for the habitation of man. These are mainly possessed by the\r\nKerretani, a people of the Iberians. The hams they cure are excellent,\r\nfully equal to those of the Cantabrians,[1232] and they realize no\r\ninconsiderable profit to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n12. Immediately after passing Idubeda, you enter on Keltiberia, a large\r\nand irregular country. It is for the most part rugged, and watered by\r\nrivers, being traversed by the Guadiana,[1233] the Tagus, and many other\r\nof the rivers which flow into the western sea, but have their sources in\r\nKeltiberia. Of their number is the Douro, which flows by Numantia[1234]\r\nand Serguntia. The Guadalquiver[1235] rises in Orospeda, and after\r\npassing through Oretania, enters Bætica. The Berones inhabit the\r\ndistricts north of the Keltiberians, and are neighbours of the Conish\r\nCantabrians. They likewise had their origin in the Keltic expedition.\r\nTheir city is Varia,[1236] situated near to the passage of the Ebro.\r\nThey are adjacent to the Bardyitæ, now called the Bardyli.[1237] To the\r\nwest [of the Keltiberians] are certain of the Astures, Gallicians, and\r\nVaccæi, besides Vettones and Carpetani. On the south are the Oretani,\r\nand the other inhabitants of Orospeda, both Bastetani and Edetani,[1238]\r\nand to the east is Idubeda.\r\n\r\n13. Of the four divisions into which the Keltiberians are separated, the\r\nmost powerful are the Aruaci, situated to the east and south, near to\r\nthe Carpetani and the sources of the Tagus. Their most renowned city is\r\nNumantia. They showed their valour in the war of twenty years, waged by\r\nthe Keltiberians against the Romans; for many armies of the Romans,\r\ntogether with their generals, were destroyed; and in the end the\r\nNumantians, besieged within their city, endured the famine with\r\nconstancy, till, reduced to a very small number, they were compelled to\r\nsurrender the place. The Lusones are also situated to the east, and\r\nlikewise border on the sources of the Tagus. Segeda and Pallantia[1239]\r\nare cities of the [CAS. 162] Aruaci. Numantia is distant from Cæsar\r\nAugusta,[1240] situated as we have said upon the Ebro, about 800 stadia.\r\nNear to Segobriga and Bilbilis,[1241] likewise cities of the\r\nKeltiberians, was fought the battle between Metellus and Sertorius.\r\nPolybius, describing the people and countries of the Vaccæi and\r\nKeltiberians, enumerates Segesama[1242] and Intercatia amongst their\r\nother cities. Posidonius tells us that Marcus Marcellus exacted of\r\nKeltiberia a tribute of 600 talents, which proves that the Keltiberians\r\nwere a numerous and wealthy people, notwithstanding the little fertility\r\nof their country. Polybius narrates that Tiberius Gracchus destroyed 300\r\ncities of the Keltiberians. This Posidonius ridicules, and asserts that\r\nto flatter Gracchus, Polybius described as cities the towers such as are\r\nexhibited in the triumphal processions.[1243] This is not incredible;\r\nfor both generals and historians easily fall into this species of\r\ndeception, by exaggerating their doings. Those who assert that Iberia\r\ncontained more than a thousand cities, seem to me to have been carried\r\naway in a similar manner, and to have denominated as cities what were\r\nmerely large villages; since, from its very nature, this country is\r\nincapable of maintaining so many cities, on account of its sterility,\r\nwildness, and its out-of-the-way position. Nor, with the exception of\r\nthose who dwell along the shores of the Mediterranean, is any such\r\nstatement confirmed by the mode of life or actions of the inhabitants.\r\nThe inhabitants of the villages, who constitute the majority of the\r\nIberians, are quite uncivilized. Even the cities cannot very easily\r\nrefine the manners [of their inhabitants], as the neighbouring woods are\r\nfull of robbers, waiting only an opportunity to inflict injury on the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n14. Beyond the Keltiberians to the south are the inhabitants of\r\nOrospeda and the country about the Xucar,[1244] the Sidetani,[1245] [who\r\nextend] as far as Carthage,[1246] and the Bastetani and Oretani, [who\r\nextend] almost as far as Malaca.[1247]\r\n\r\n15. All the Iberians, so to speak, were peltastæ, furnished with light\r\narms for the purposes of robbery, and, as we described the Lusitanians,\r\nusing the javelin, the sling, and the sword. They have some cavalry\r\ninterspersed amongst the foot-soldiers, the horses are trained to\r\ntraverse the mountains, and to sink down on their knees at the word of\r\ncommand, in case of necessity. Iberia produces abundance of antelopes\r\nand wild horses. In many places the lakes are stocked. They have fowl,\r\nswans, and birds of similar kind, and vast numbers of bustards. Beavers\r\nare found in the rivers, but the castor does not possess the same virtue\r\nas that from the Euxine,[1248] the drug from that place having peculiar\r\nproperties of its own, as is the case in many other instances. Thus\r\nPosidonius tells us that the Cyprian copper alone produces the cadmian\r\nstone, copperas-water, and oxide of copper. He likewise informs us of\r\nthe singular fact, that in Iberia the crows are not black; and that the\r\nhorses of Keltiberia which are spotted, lose that colour when they pass\r\ninto Ulterior Iberia. He compares them to the Parthian horses, for\r\nindeed they are superior to all other breeds, both in fleetness and\r\ntheir ease in speedy travelling.\r\n\r\n16. Iberia produces a large quantity of roots used in dyeing. In olives,\r\nvines, figs, and every kind of similar fruit-trees, the Iberian coast\r\nnext the Mediterranean abounds, they are likewise plentiful beyond. Of\r\nthe coasts next the ocean, that towards the north is destitute of them,\r\non account of the cold, and the remaining portion generally on account\r\nof the apathy of the men, and because they do not lead a civilized life,\r\nbut pass their days in poverty, only acting on the animal [CAS. 164]\r\nimpulse, and living most corruptly. They do not attend to ease or\r\nluxury, unless any one considers it can add to the happiness of their\r\nlives to wash themselves and their wives in stale urine kept in tanks,\r\nand to rinse their teeth with it, which they say is the custom both with\r\nthe Cantabrians and their neighbours.[1249] This practice, as well as\r\nthat of sleeping on the ground, is common both among the Iberians and\r\nKelts. Some say that the Gallicians are atheists, but that the\r\nKeltiberians, and their neighbours to the north, [sacrifice] to a\r\nnameless god, every full moon, at night, before their doors, the whole\r\nfamily passing the night in dancing and festival. The Vettones, the\r\nfirst time they came to a Roman camp, and saw certain of the officers\r\nwalking up and down the roads for the mere pleasure of walking, supposed\r\nthat they were mad, and offered to show them the way to their tents. For\r\nthey thought, when not fighting, one should remain quietly seated at\r\nease.[1250]\r\n\r\n17. What Artemidorus relates concerning the adornment of certain of\r\ntheir women, must likewise be attributed to their barbarous customs. He\r\nsays that they wear iron collars having crows fixed to them which bend\r\nover the head, and fall forward considerably over the forehead. When\r\nthey wish they draw their veil over these crows, so as to shade the\r\nwhole face: this they consider an ornament. Others wear a\r\ntympanium[1251] surrounding the occiput, and fitting tight to the head\r\nas far as the ears, turning over [and increasing] little by little in\r\nheight and breadth. Others again make bald the front of the head, in\r\norder to display the forehead to greater advantage. Some twist their\r\nflowing hair round a small style, a foot high, and afterwards cover it\r\nwith a black veil. Of singularities like these many have been observed\r\nand recorded as to all the Iberian nations in common, but particularly\r\nthose towards the north, not only concerning their bravery, but likewise\r\ntheir cruelty and brutal madness. For in the war against the\r\nCantabrians, mothers have slain their children sooner than suffer them\r\nto be captured; and a young boy, having obtained a sword, slew, at the\r\ncommand of his father, both his parents and brothers, who had been made\r\nprisoners and were bound, and a woman those who had been taken together\r\nwith her. A man being invited by a party of drunken [soldiers] to their\r\nfeast, threw himself into a fire. These feelings are common both to the\r\nKeltic, Thracian, and Scythian nations, as well as the valour not only\r\nof their men, but likewise of their women. These till the ground,[1252]\r\nand after parturition, having put their husbands instead of themselves\r\nto bed, they wait upon them. Frequently in their employment they wash\r\nand swathe their infants, sitting down by some stream. Posidonius tells\r\nus that in Liguria, his host Charmoleon, a man who came from Marseilles,\r\nrelated to him, that having hired some men and women to dig his land,\r\none of the women was seized with the pains of labour, and going to a\r\nlittle distance from where they were at work, she brought forth, and\r\nreturned immediately to her work, for fear she might lose her pay. He\r\nobserved that she was evidently working in considerable pain, but was\r\nnot aware of the cause till towards evening, when he ascertained it, and\r\nsent her away, having given her her wages. She then carried her infant\r\nto a small spring, and having washed it, wrapped it up in as good\r\nswaddling clothes as she could get, and made the best of her way home.\r\n\r\n18. Another practice, not restricted to the Iberians alone, is for two\r\nto mount on one horse, so that in the event of a conflict, one may be\r\nthere to fight on foot. Neither are they the only sufferers in being\r\ntormented with vast swarms of mice, from which pestilential diseases\r\nhave frequently ensued. This occurred to the Romans in Cantabria, so\r\nthat they caused it to be proclaimed, that whoever would catch the mice\r\nshould receive rewards according to the number taken, and [even with\r\nthis] they were scarcely preserved, as they were suffering besides from\r\nwant of corn and other necessaries, it being difficult to get supplies\r\nof corn from Aquitaine on account of [CAS. 165] the rugged nature of the\r\ncountry. It is a proof of the ferocity of the Cantabrians, that a number\r\nof them having been taken prisoners and fixed to the cross, they chanted\r\nsongs of triumph. Instances such as these are proofs of the ferocity of\r\ntheir manners. There are others which, although not showing them to be\r\npolished, are certainly not brutish. For example, amongst the\r\nCantabrians, the men give dowries to their wives, and the daughters are\r\nleft heirs, but they procure wives for their brothers. These things\r\nindicate a degree of power in the woman, although they are no proof of\r\nadvanced civilization.[1253] It is also a custom with the Iberians to\r\nfurnish themselves with a poison, which kills without pain, and which\r\nthey procure from a herb resembling parsley. This they hold in readiness\r\nin case of misfortune, and to devote themselves for those whose cause\r\nthey have joined, thus dying for their sake.[1254]\r\n\r\n19. Some, as I have said, state that this country is separated into\r\nfour divisions; others, into five. It is not easy to state any thing\r\nprecisely on these points, both on account of the changes which the\r\nplaces have undergone, and by reason of their obscurity. In well-known\r\nand notable countries both the migrations are known, and the divisions\r\nof the land, and the changes of their names, and every thing else of the\r\nsame kind. Such matters being the common topics with everybody, and\r\nespecially with the Greeks, who are more talkative than any other\r\npeople. But in barbarous and out-of-the-way countries, and such as are\r\ncut up into small divisions, and lie scattered, the remembrance of such\r\noccurrences is not nearly so certain, nor yet so full. If these\r\ncountries are far removed from the Greeks [our] ignorance is increased.\r\nFor although the Roman historians imitate the Greeks, they fall far\r\nshort of them. What they relate is taken from the Greeks, very little\r\nbeing the result of their own ardour in acquiring information. So that\r\nwhenever any thing has been omitted by the former there is not much\r\nsupplied by the latter. Add to this, that the names most celebrated are\r\ngenerally Grecian. Formerly the name of Iberia was given to the whole\r\ncountry between the Rhone and the isthmus formed by the two Galatic\r\ngulfs; whereas now they make the Pyrenees its boundary, and call it\r\nindifferently Iberia or Hispania; others have restricted Iberia to the\r\ncountry on this side the Ebro.[1255] Still earlier it bore the name of\r\nthe Igletes,[1256] who inhabited but a small district, according to\r\nAsclepiades the Myrlean. The Romans call the whole indifferently Iberia\r\nand Hispania, [CAS. 166] but designate one portion of it Ulterior, and\r\nthe other Citerior. However, at different periods they have divided it\r\ndifferently, according to its political aspect at various times.\r\n\r\n20. At the present time some of the provinces having been assigned to\r\nthe people and senate of the Romans, and the others to the emperor,\r\nBætica appertains to the people, and a prætor has been sent into the\r\ncountry, having under him a quæstor and a lieutenant. Its eastern\r\nboundary has been fixed near to Castlon.[1257] The remainder belongs to\r\nthe emperor, who deputes two lieutenants, a prætor, and a consul. The\r\nprætor with a lieutenant administers justice amongst the Lusitanians,\r\nwho are situated next Bætica, and extend as far as the outlets of the\r\nriver Douro, for at the present time this district is called Lusitania\r\nby the inhabitants. Here is [the city of] Augusta Emerita.[1258] What\r\nremains, which is [indeed] the greater part of Iberia, is governed by\r\nthe consul, who has under him a respectable force, consisting of about\r\nthree legions, with three lieutenants, one of whom with two legions\r\nguards the whole country north of the Douro, the inhabitants of which\r\nformerly were styled Lusitanians, but are now called Gallicians. The\r\nnorthern mountains, together with the Asturian and Cantabrian, border on\r\nthese. The river Melsus[1259] flows through the country of the\r\nAsturians, and at a little distance is the city of Noïga,[1260] close to\r\nan estuary formed by the ocean, which separates the Asturians from the\r\nCantabrians. The second lieutenant with the remaining legion governs the\r\nadjoining district as far as the Pyrenees. The third oversees the\r\nmidland district, and governs the cities inhabited by the togati, whom\r\nwe have before alluded to as inclined to peace, and who have adopted the\r\nrefined manners and mode of life of the Italians, together with the\r\ntoga. These are the Keltiberians, and those who dwell on either side of\r\nthe Ebro, as far as the sea-coast. The consul passes the winter in the\r\nmaritime districts, mostly administering justice either in [the city\r\nof] Carthage,[1261] or Tarraco.[1262] During the summer he travels\r\nthrough the country, observing whatever may need reform. There are also\r\nthe procurators of the emperor, men of the equestrian rank, who\r\ndistribute the pay to the soldiers for their maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of the islands which are situated in front of Iberia, two named the\r\nPityussæ, and two the Gymnasiæ, (also called the Baleares,) are situated\r\non the sea-coast between Tarraco and [the river] Xucar, on which\r\nSaguntum[1263] is built. The Pityussæ are situated farther in the high\r\nseas and more to the west than the Gymnasiæ. One of the Pityussæ is\r\ncalled Ebusus,[1264] having a city of the same name. This island is 400\r\nstadia in circumference, and nearly equal in its breadth and length. The\r\nother, [named] Ophiussa, is situated near to this, but is desert, and\r\nmuch smaller. The larger[1265] of the Gymnasiæ contains two cities,\r\nPalma,[1266] and Polentia;[1267] the latter lying towards the east, the\r\nformer towards the west. The length of this island is scarcely less than\r\n600 stadia, its breadth 200; although Artemidorus asserts it is twice\r\nthis size both in breadth and length.[1268] The smaller island[1269] is\r\nabout [2]70 stadia distant from Polentia; in size it is far surpassed\r\nby the larger island, but in excellence it is by no means inferior, for\r\nboth of them are very fertile, and furnished with harbours. At the\r\nmouths of these however there are rocks rising but a little out of the\r\nwater, which renders attention necessary in entering them. The fertility\r\nof these places inclines the inhabitants to peace, as also the people of\r\nEbusus. But certain [CAS. 168] malefactors, though few in number, having\r\nassociated with the pirates in those seas, they all got a bad name, and\r\nMetellus, surnamed Balearicus, marched against them. He it was who built\r\nthe cities. But owing to the great fertility of the country, these\r\npeople have always had enemies plotting against them. Although naturally\r\ndisposed to peace, they bear the reputation of being most excellent\r\nslingers, which art they have been proficient in since the time that the\r\nPhœnicians possessed the islands. It is said that these[1270] were the\r\nfirst who introduced amongst the men [of the Baleares] the custom of\r\nwearing tunics with wide borders. They were accustomed to go into battle\r\nnaked, having a shield covered with goat-skin in their hand, and a\r\njavelin hardened by fire at the point, very rarely with an iron tip, and\r\nwearing round the head three slings of black rush,[1271] hair, or sinew.\r\nThe long sling they use for hitting at far distances, the short one for\r\nnear marks, and the middle one for those between. From childhood they\r\nwere so thoroughly practised in the use of slings, that bread was never\r\ndistributed to the children till they had won it by the sling.[1272] On\r\nthis account Metellus, when he was approaching the islands, spread pelts\r\nover the decks, as a shelter from the slings. He introduced [into the\r\ncountry] 3000 Roman colonists from Spain.\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the fruitfulness of the land, noxious animals are\r\nrarely to be met with. Even the rabbits, they say, were not indigenous,\r\nbut that a male and female having been introduced by some one from the\r\nopposite continent, from thence the whole stock sprung, which formerly\r\nwas so great a nuisance that even houses and trees were overturned,\r\n[being undermined] by their warrens, and the inhabitants were\r\ncompelled, as we have related, to resort for refuge to the Romans.\r\nHowever, at the present day the facility with which these animals are\r\ntaken, prevents them from doing injury, consequently those who possess\r\nland cultivate it with advantage. These [islands] are on this side of\r\nwhat are called the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\n3. Near to them are two small islands, one of which is called the Island\r\nof Juno: some call these the Pillars. Beyond the Pillars is Gades,[1273]\r\nconcerning which all that we have hitherto remarked is, that it is\r\ndistant from Calpe[1274] about 750 stadia, and is situated near to the\r\noutlet of the Guadalquiver.[1275] Notwithstanding there is much can be\r\nsaid about it. For its inhabitants equip the greatest number of ships,\r\nand the largest in size, both for our sea,[1276] and the exterior\r\n[ocean], although the island they inhabit is by no means large, nor yet\r\ndo they possess much of the mainland, nor are masters of other islands.\r\nThey dwell for the most part on the sea, only a few staying at home or\r\npassing their time in Rome. Still, in amount of population, their city\r\ndoes not seem to be surpassed by any with the exception of Rome. I have\r\nheard that in a census taken within our own times, there were enumerated\r\nfive hundred citizens of Gades of the equestrian order, a number\r\nequalled by none of the Italian cities excepting that of the\r\nPatavini.[1277] However, notwithstanding their vast number, its\r\ninhabitants possess an island, in length[1278] not much above 100\r\nstadia, and in some places only one stadium in breadth. Originally the\r\ncity in which they dwelt was extremely small, but Balbus[1279] the\r\nGaditanian, who received the honours of a [CAS. 169] triumph, added\r\nanother to it which they call the New Town. These two form the city of\r\nDidyme,[1280] which is not above twenty stadia in circumference. In it,\r\nhowever, they are not pressed for room, because few live at home, the\r\nmajority passing their lives on the sea, some too dwelling on the\r\nopposite continent, and particularly on a little island adjacent on\r\naccount of its excellence. They have such a liking for this place as\r\nalmost to have made it a rival city to Didyme. However, few in\r\ncomparison inhabit either this or the sea-port which Balbus constructed\r\nfor them on the opposite continent. Their city is situated in the\r\nwestern parts of the island. Near to it is the temple of Saturn, which\r\nterminates [Gades to the west], and is opposite the smaller island. The\r\ntemple of Hercules is on the other side, to the east, where the island\r\napproaches nearest to the mainland, being only separated therefrom by a\r\nstrait of a stadium [in breadth].[1281] They say that this temple is\r\ntwelve miles from the city, thus making the number of miles and the\r\nnumber of [Hercules’] labours equal: but this is too great, being almost\r\nequal to the length of the island. Now the length of the island runs\r\nfrom west to east.\r\n\r\n4. Pherecydes appears to have given to Gades the name of Erythia, the\r\nlocality of the myths concerning Geryon: others suppose it to have been\r\nthe island situated near to this city, and separated from it by a strait\r\nof merely one stadium. This they do on account of the excellence of its\r\npasturage. For the milk of the cattle which feed there does not yield\r\nany whey, and they are obliged to mix it with large quantities of water\r\nwhen they make cheese on account of its richness. After fifty days the\r\nbeasts [pasturing there] would be choked unless they were let blood. The\r\npasturage of the country is dry, but it fattens wonderfully: and it is\r\nthought that from this the myth concerning the oxen of Geryon took its\r\nrise. The whole sea-shore however is possessed in common.[1282]\r\n\r\n5. Concerning the foundation of Gades, the Gaditanians report that a\r\ncertain oracle commanded the Tyrians to found a colony by the Pillars of\r\nHercules. Those who were sent out for the purpose of exploring, when\r\nthey had arrived at the strait by Calpe, imagined that the capes which\r\nform the strait were the boundaries of the habitable earth, as well as\r\nof the expedition of Hercules, and consequently they were what the\r\noracle termed the Pillars. They landed on the inside of the straits, at\r\na place where the city of the Exitani now stands. Here they offered\r\nsacrifices, which however not being favourable, they returned. After a\r\ntime others were sent, who advanced about 1500[1283] stadia beyond the\r\nstrait, to an island consecrated to Hercules, and lying opposite to\r\nOnoba, a city of Iberia: considering that here were the Pillars, they\r\nsacrificed to the god, but the sacrifices being again unfavourable, they\r\nreturned home. In the third voyage they reached Gades, and founded the\r\ntemple in the eastern part of the island, and the city in the west. On\r\nthis account some consider that the capes in the strait are the Pillars,\r\nothers suppose Gades, while others again believe that they lie still\r\nfarther, beyond Gades. There are also some who think that the Pillars\r\nare Calpe,[1284] and the mountain of Libya which is opposite, named\r\nAbilyx,[1285] and situated, according to Eratosthenes, amongst the\r\nMetagonians, a wandering race. Others fancy that they are two small\r\nislands near to the former, one of which is named the Island of Juno.\r\nArtemidorus speaks both of the Island of Juno and the temple there, but\r\nmakes no mention either of mount Abilyx, or the nation of the [CAS. 170]\r\nMetagonians.[1286] Some have transported hither the Planctæ and the\r\nSymplegades, supposing them to be the Pillars, which Pindar calls the\r\nGates of Gades, when he says that they were the farthest limits at which\r\nHercules arrived.[1287] Dicæarchus, Eratosthenes, and Polybius, with\r\nmost of the Grecians, represent the Pillars as being close to the\r\nstrait, while the Iberians and Libyans place them at Gades, alleging\r\nthat there is nothing at all resembling pillars close by the strait.\r\nOthers pretend that they are the pillars of brass eight cubits high in\r\nthe temple of Hercules at Gades, on which is inscribed the cost of\r\nerecting that edifice; and that the sailors coming there on the\r\ncompletion of their voyage and sacrificing to Hercules, rendered the\r\nplace so famous that it came to be regarded as the termination of the\r\nland and sea. Posidonius thinks this view the most probable of all, and\r\nlooks upon the oracle and the several expeditions as a Phœnician\r\ninvention.[1288] As for the expeditions, what matters it whether any one\r\nshould vehemently deny or credit the account, as neither the one nor the\r\nother would be inconsistent with reason: but the assertion that neither\r\nthe little islands, nor yet the mountains, bear much resemblance to\r\npillars, and that we should seek for pillars, strictly so called, [set\r\nup] either as the termination of the habitable earth, or of the\r\nexpedition of Hercules, has at all events some reason in it; it being an\r\nancient usage to set up such boundary marks. As for instance the small\r\ncolumn which the inhabitants of Rhegium[1289] erected by the Strait of\r\nSicily, which is indeed a little tower; and the tower called after\r\nPelorus, which is situated opposite to this small column; also the\r\nstructures called altars[1290] of the Philæni, about midway in the land\r\nbetween the Syrtes; likewise it is recorded, that a certain pillar was\r\nformerly erected on the Isthmus of Corinth, which the Ionians who took\r\npossession of Attica and Megaris when they were driven out of the\r\nPeloponnesus, and those who settled in the Peloponnesus, set up in\r\ncommon, and inscribed on the side next Megaris,\r\n\r\n   “This is no longer Peloponnesus, but Ionia;”\r\n\r\nand on the opposite,\r\n\r\n   “This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia.”\r\n\r\nAlexander too erected altars as boundaries of his Indian campaign in\r\nthose parts of the Indies he arrived at, which were situated farthest\r\ntowards the east, in imitation of Hercules and Bacchus.[1291] That this\r\ncustom existed, then, cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\n6. It is probable that the places themselves took the same name [as the\r\nmonuments], especially after time had destroyed the boundary marks which\r\nhad been placed there. For instance, at the present day the altars of\r\nthe Philæni no longer exist, but the place itself bears that\r\ndesignation. Similarly they say that in India neither the pillars of\r\nHercules or Bacchus are to be seen, nevertheless certain localities\r\nbeing described and pointed out to the Macedonians, they believed that\r\nthose places were the pillars in which they discovered any trace either\r\nof the adventures of Bacchus or Hercules. In the instance before us, it\r\nis not improbable that they who first [visited these regions], set up\r\nboundary marks fashioned by the hand of man, such as altars, towers, and\r\npillars, in the most remarkable situations, to indicate the farthest\r\ndistance they had reached, (and straits, the surrounding mountains, and\r\nlittle islands, are indubitably the most remarkable situations for\r\npointing out the termination or commencement of places,) and that after\r\nthese human monuments had decayed, their names descended to the places\r\n[where they had stood]; whether that were the little islands or the\r\ncapes forming the strait. This latter point it would not be easy now to\r\ndetermine; the name would suit either place, as they both bear some\r\nresemblance to pillars; I say bear some resemblance, because they are\r\nplaced in such situations as might well indicate boundaries. Now this\r\nstrait is styled a mouth, as well as many others, but the mouth is at\r\nthe beginning to those sailing into the strait, and to those who are\r\nquitting it at the end. The little islands at the mouth having a contour\r\neasy to describe, and being remarkable, one might not improperly compare\r\nto pillars. In like manner the mountains overlooking the strait are\r\nprominent, [CAS. 172] resembling columns or pillars. So too Pindar might\r\nvery justly have said, “The Gaditanian Gates,” if he had in mind the\r\npillars at the mouth; for these mouths are very similar to gates. On the\r\nother hand, Gades is not in a position to indicate an extremity, but is\r\nsituated about the middle of a long coast forming a kind of gulf. The\r\nsupposition that the pillars of the temple of Hercules in Gades are\r\nintended, appears to me still less probable. It seems most likely that\r\nthe name was originally conferred not by merchants, but generals, its\r\ncelebrity afterwards became universal, as was the case with the Indian\r\npillars. Besides, the inscription recorded refutes this idea, since it\r\ncontains no religious dedication, but a mere list of expenses; whereas\r\nthe pillars of Hercules should have been a record of the hero’s\r\nwonderful deeds, not of Phœnician expenditure.\r\n\r\n7. Polybius relates that there is a spring within the temple of Hercules\r\nat Gades, having a descent of a few steps to fresh water, which is\r\naffected in a manner the reverse of the sea-tides, subsiding at the flow\r\nof the tide, and springing at the ebb. He assigns as the cause of this\r\nphenomenon, that air rises from the interior to the surface of the\r\nearth; when this surface is covered by the waves, at the rising of the\r\nsea, the air is deprived of its ordinary vents, and returns to the\r\ninterior, stopping up the passages of the spring, and causing a want of\r\nwater, but when the surface is again laid bare, the air having a direct\r\nexit liberates the channels which feed the spring, so that it gushes\r\nfreely. Artemidorus rejects this explanation, and substitutes one of his\r\nown, recording at the same time the opinion of the historian Silanus;\r\nbut neither one or other of their views seems to me worth relating,\r\nsince both he and Silanus were ignorant in regard to these matters.\r\nPosidonius asserts that the entire account is false, and adds that there\r\nare two wells in the temple of Hercules, and a third in the city. That\r\nthe smaller of the two in the temple of Hercules, if drawn from\r\nfrequently, will become for a time exhausted, but that on ceasing to\r\ndraw from it, it fills again: while in regard to the larger, it may be\r\ndrawn from during the whole day; that it is true it becomes lower, like\r\nall other wells, but that it fills again during the night when drawing\r\nceases. [He adds] that the ebb tide frequently happening to occur during\r\nthe period of its re-filling, gave rise to the groundless belief of the\r\ninhabitants as to its being affected in an opposite manner [to the tides\r\nof the ocean]. However it is not only related by him that it is a\r\ncommonly believed fact, but we have received it from tradition as much\r\nreferred to amongst paradoxes.[1292] We have likewise heard that there\r\nare wells both within the city and also in the gardens without, but that\r\non account of the inferiority of this water, tanks are generally\r\nconstructed throughout the city for the supply of water: whether\r\nlikewise any of these reservoirs give any signs of being affected in an\r\nopposite manner to the tides, we know not. If such be the case, the\r\ncauses thereof should be received as amongst phenomena hard to be\r\nexplained. It is likely that Polybius may have assigned the proper\r\nreason; but it is also likely that certain of the channels of the\r\nsprings being damped outside become relaxed, and so let the water run\r\nout into the surrounding land, instead of forcing it along its ancient\r\npassage to the spring; and there will of course be moisture when the\r\ntide overflows.[1293] But if, as Athenodorus asserts, the ebb and flow\r\nresemble the inspiration and expiration of the breath, it is possible\r\nthat some of the currents of water which naturally have an efflux on to\r\nthe surface of the earth, through various channels, the mouths of which\r\nwe denominate springs and fountains, are by other channels drawn towards\r\nthe depths of the sea, and raise it, so as to produce a flood-tide; when\r\nthe expiration is sufficient, they leave off the course in which they\r\nare then flowing, and again revert to their former direction, when that\r\nagain takes a change.[1294]\r\n\r\n8. I cannot tell how it is that Posidonius, who describes the Phœnicians\r\nas sagacious in other things, should here attribute [CAS. 173] to them\r\nfolly rather than shrewdness. The sun completes his revolution in the\r\nspace of a day and night, being a portion of the time beneath the earth,\r\nand a portion of the time shining upon it. Now he asserts that the\r\nmotion of the sea corresponds with the revolution of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and experiences a diurnal, monthly, and annual change, in strict\r\naccordance with the changes of the moon. For [he continues] when the\r\nmoon is elevated one sign of the zodiac[1295] above the horizon, the sea\r\nbegins sensibly to swell and cover the shores, until she has attained\r\nher meridian; but when that satellite begins to decline, the sea again\r\nretires by degrees, until the moon wants merely one sign of the zodiac\r\nfrom setting; it then remains stationary until the moon has set, and\r\nalso descended one sign of the zodiac below the horizon, when it again\r\nrises until she has attained her meridian below the earth; it then\r\nretires again until the moon is within one sign of the zodiac of her\r\nrising above the horizon, when it remains stationary until the moon has\r\nrisen one sign of the zodiac above the earth, and then begins to rise as\r\nbefore. Such he describes to be the diurnal revolution. In respect to\r\nthe monthly revolution, [he says] that the spring-tides occur at the\r\ntime of the new moon, when they decrease until the first quarter; they\r\nthen increase until full moon, when they again decrease until the last\r\nquarter, after which they increase till the new moon; [he adds] that\r\nthese increases ought to be understood both of their duration and speed.\r\nIn regard to the annual revolution, he says that he learned from the\r\nstatements of the Gaditanians, that both the ebb and flow tides were at\r\ntheir extremes at the summer solstice: and that hence he conjectured\r\nthat they decreased until the [autumnal] equinox; then increased till\r\nthe winter solstice; then decreased again until the vernal equinox; and\r\n[finally] increased until the summer solstice. But since these\r\nrevolutions occur twice in the four-and-twenty hours, the sea rising\r\ntwice and receding twice, and that regularly every day and night, how is\r\nit that the filling and failing of the well do not frequently occur\r\nduring the ebb and flow of the tide? or if it be allowed that this does\r\noften occur, why does it not do so in the same proportion? and if it\r\ndoes so in the same proportion, how comes it that the Gaditanians are\r\nnot competent to observe what is of daily occurrence, while they are\r\nnevertheless competent to the observing of revolutions which occur but\r\nonce in the year. That Posidonius himself credited these reports is\r\nevident from his own conjecture respecting the decrease and increase [of\r\nthe sea] from solstice to solstice. However, it is not likely, being an\r\nobservant people, that they should be ignorant of what actually\r\noccurred, whilst giving credit to imaginary phenomena.\r\n\r\n9. Posidonius tells us that Seleucus, a native of the country next the\r\nErythræan Sea,[1296] states that the regularity and irregularity of the\r\nebb and flow of the sea follow the different positions of the moon in\r\nthe zodiac; that when she is in the equinoctial signs the tides are\r\nregular, but that when she is in the signs next the tropics, the tides\r\nare irregular both in their height and force; and that for the remaining\r\nsigns the irregularity is greater or less, according as they are more or\r\nless removed from the signs before mentioned. Posidonius adds, that\r\nduring the summer solstice and whilst the moon was full, he himself\r\npassed many days in the temple of Hercules at Gades, but could not\r\nobserve any thing of these annual irregularities. However, about the new\r\nmoon of the same month he observed at Ilipa[1297] a great change in the\r\nreflux of the water of the Guadalquiver, as compared with previous\r\nflood-tides, in which the water did not rise half as high as the banks,\r\nand that then the water poured in so copiously, that the soldiers there\r\ndipped their supply without difficulty, although Ilipa is about 700\r\nstadia from the sea. He says, that the plains next the sea were covered\r\nby the tides to a distance of 30[1298] stadia, and to such a depth as to\r\nform islands, while the basement of the temple in the enclosure\r\ndedicated to Hercules, and the top of the mole in front of the harbour\r\nof Gades, were not covered higher than 10 cubits, as observed by actual\r\nsoundings; but if any one should add the double of that for the\r\noccasional risings of the tide which occur, [neither] thus would he be\r\nable to estimate the violence with which the full force of the high tide\r\nrushes over the plains. Posidonius informs us that this violence [of the\r\ntide] is common to all the coasts of Spain on the Atlantic,[1299] but\r\nwhat he [CAS. 175] relates concerning the Ebro is unusual and peculiar\r\nto itself, for he says that it sometimes overflows after continued north\r\nwinds, although there may have been neither rains nor snows. The cause\r\nof this [he supposes] to be the lake through which the Ebro flows, its\r\nwaters being driven by the winds into the current of the river.[1300]\r\n\r\n10. The same writer mentions a tree at Gades, which had boughs reaching\r\nto the ground; its sword-shaped leaves often measuring a cubit long, and\r\nfour fingers broad. Also that about Carthagena there was a tree whose\r\nthorns produced a bark from which most beautiful stuffs were woven. As\r\nfor the tree [he saw] at Gades, we ourselves have observed a similar in\r\nEgypt, so far as the inclination of the boughs is concerned, but with a\r\ndifferently shaped leaf, and producing no fruit, which according to him\r\nthe other did. In Cappadocia there are stuffs made from thorns, but it\r\nis not a tree which produces the thorn from which the bark is taken, but\r\na low plant; he also tells us of a tree at Gades, from which if a branch\r\nbe broken off a milk will flow, and if the root be cut a red fluid runs.\r\nThus much for Gades.\r\n\r\n11. The Cassiterides are ten in number, and lie near each other in the\r\nocean towards the north from the haven of the Artabri. One of them is\r\ndesert, but the others are inhabited by men in black cloaks, clad in\r\ntunics reaching to the feet, girt about the breast, and walking with\r\nstaves, thus resembling the Furies we see in tragic\r\nrepresentations.[1301] They subsist by their cattle, leading for the\r\nmost part a wandering life. Of the metals they have tin and lead; which\r\nwith skins they barter with the merchants for earthenware, salt, and\r\nbrazen vessels. Formerly the Phœnicians alone carried on this traffic\r\nfrom Gades, concealing the passage from every one; and when the Romans\r\nfollowed a certain ship-master, that they also might find the market,\r\nthe ship-master of jealousy purposely ran his vessel upon a shoal,\r\nleading on those who followed him into the same destructive disaster; he\r\nhimself escaped by means of a fragment of the ship, and received from\r\nthe state the value of the cargo he had lost. The Romans nevertheless by\r\nfrequent efforts discovered the passage, and as soon as Publius Crassus,\r\npassing over to them, perceived that the metals were dug out at a little\r\ndepth, and that the men were peaceably disposed, he declared it to those\r\nwho already wished to traffic in this sea for profit, although the\r\npassage was longer than that to Britain.[1302] Thus far concerning\r\nIberia and the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nGAUL.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fourth Book contains a description of the regions about Gaul, Spain,\r\n  and the Alps on this side, towards Italy. Likewise of Britain, and of\r\n  certain islands in the ocean which are habitable, together with the\r\n  country of the barbarians, and the nations dwelling beyond the Danube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Next in order [after Iberia] comes Keltica beyond the Alps,[1303] the\r\nconfiguration and size of which has been already mentioned in a general\r\nmanner; we are now to describe it more particularly. Some divide it into\r\nthe three nations of the Aquitani, Belgæ, and Keltæ.[1304] Of these the\r\nAquitani differ completely from the other nations, not only in their\r\nlanguage but in their figure, which resembles more that of the Iberians\r\nthan the Galatæ. The others are Galatæ in countenance, although they do\r\nnot all speak the same language, but some make a slight difference in\r\ntheir speech; neither is their polity and mode of life exactly the same.\r\nThese writers give the name of Aquitani and Keltæ to the dwellers near\r\nthe Pyrenees, which are bounded by the Cevennes. For it has been stated\r\nthat this Keltica is bounded on the west by the mountains of the\r\nPyrenees, which extend to either sea, both the Mediterranean and the\r\nocean; on the east by the Rhine, which is parallel to the Pyrenees; on\r\nthe north by the ocean, from the northern extremities of the Pyrenees to\r\nthe mouths of the Rhine; on the south by the sea of Marseilles, and\r\nNarbonne, and by the Alps from Liguria to the sources of the Rhine. The\r\nCevennes lie at right angles to the Pyrenees, and traverse the plains\r\nfor about 2000 stadia, terminating in the middle near Lugdunum.[1305]\r\nThey call those people Aquitani who inhabit the northern portions of the\r\nPyrenees, and the Cevennes extending as far as the ocean, and bounded by\r\nthe river Garonne; and Keltæ, those who dwell on the other side of the\r\nGaronne, towards the sea of Marseilles and Narbonne, and touching a\r\nportion of the Alpine chain. This is the division adopted by divus Cæsar\r\nin his Commentaries.[1306] But Augustus Cæsar, when dividing the country\r\ninto four parts, united the Keltæ to the Narbonnaise; the Aquitani he\r\npreserved the same as Julius Cæsar, but added thereto fourteen other\r\nnations of those who dwelt between the Garonne and the river\r\nLoire,[1307] and dividing the rest into two parts, the one extending to\r\nthe upper districts of the Rhine he made dependent upon Lugdunum, the\r\nother [he assigned] [CAS. 177] to the Belgæ. However, it is the duty of\r\nthe Geographer to describe the physical divisions of each country, and\r\nthose which result from diversity of nations, when they seem worthy of\r\nnotice; as to the limits which princes, induced by a policy which\r\ncircumstances dictate, have variously imposed, it will be sufficient for\r\nhim to notice them summarily, leaving others to furnish particular\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n2. The whole of this country is irrigated by rivers descending from the\r\nAlps, the Cevennes, and the Pyrenees, some of which discharge themselves\r\ninto the ocean, others into the Mediterranean. The districts through\r\nwhich they flow are mostly plains interspersed with hills, and having\r\nnavigable streams. The course of these rivers is so happily disposed in\r\nrelation to each other, that you may traffic from one sea to the\r\nother,[1308] carrying the merchandise only a small distance, and that\r\neasily, across the plains; but for the most part by the rivers,\r\nascending some, and descending others. The Rhone is pre-eminent in this\r\nrespect, both because it communicates with many other rivers, and also\r\nbecause it flows into the Mediterranean, which, as we have said, is\r\nsuperior to the ocean,[1309] and likewise passes through the richest\r\nprovinces of Gaul. The whole of the Narbonnaise produces the same fruits\r\nas Italy. As we advance towards the north, and the mountains of the\r\nCevennes, the plantations of the olive and fig disappear, but the others\r\nremain. Likewise the vine, as you proceed northward, does not easily\r\nmature its fruit. The entire of the remaining country produces in\r\nabundance corn, millet, acorns, and mast of all kinds. No part of it\r\nlies waste except that which is taken up in marshes and woods, and even\r\nthis is inhabited. The cause of this, however, is rather a dense\r\npopulation than the industry of the inhabitants. For the women there are\r\nboth very prolific and excellent nurses, while the men devote themselves\r\nrather to war than husbandry. However, their arms being now laid aside,\r\nthey are compelled to engage in agriculture. These remarks apply\r\ngenerally to the whole of Transalpine Keltica. We must now describe\r\nparticularly each of the four divisions, which hitherto we have only\r\nmentioned in a summary manner. And, first, of the Narbonnaise.\r\n\r\n3. The configuration of this country resembles a parallelogram, the\r\nwestern side of which is traced by the Pyrenees, the north by the\r\nCevennes; as for the other two sides, the south is bounded by the sea\r\nbetween the Pyrenees and Marseilles, and the east partly by the\r\nAlps,[1310] and partly by a line drawn perpendicularly from these\r\nmountains to the foot of the Cevennes, which extend towards the Rhone,\r\nand form a right angle with the aforesaid perpendicular drawn from the\r\nAlps. To the southern side of this parallelogram we must add the\r\nsea-coast inhabited by the Massilienses[1311] and Salyes,[1312] as far\r\nas the country of the Ligurians, the confines of Italy, and the river\r\nVar. This river, as we have said before,[1313] is the boundary of the\r\nNarbonnaise and Italy. It is but small in summer, but in winter swells\r\nto a breadth of seven stadia. From thence the coast extends to the\r\ntemple of the Pyrenæan Venus,[1314] which is the boundary between this\r\nprovince and Iberia. Some, however, assert that the spot where the\r\nTrophies of Pompey stand is the boundary between Iberia and Keltica.\r\nFrom thence to Narbonne is 63 miles; from Narbonne to Nemausus,[1315]\r\n88; from Nemausus through Ugernum[1316] and Tarusco, to the hot waters\r\ncalled Sextiæ[1317] near Marseilles, 53;[1318] from thence to Antipolis\r\nand the river Var, 73; making in the total 277 miles. Some set down the\r\ndistance from the temple of Venus to the Var at 2600 stadia; while\r\nothers increase this number by 200 stadia; for there are different\r\nopinions as to these distances. As for the other road, which traverses\r\nthe [countries of the] [CAS. 179] Vocontii[1319] and Cottius,[1320] from\r\nNemausus[1321] to Ugernum and Tarusco, the route is common; from thence\r\n[it branches off in two directions], one through Druentia and\r\nCaballio,[1322] to the frontiers of the Vocontii and the commencement of\r\nthe ascent of the Alps, which is 63 miles; the other is reckoned at 99\r\nmiles from the same point to the other extremity of the Vocontii,\r\nbordering on the state of Cottius, as far as the village of\r\nEbrodunum.[1323] The distance is said to be the same by the route\r\nthrough the village of Brigantium,[1324] Scingomagus,[1325] and the\r\npassage of the Alps to Ocelum,[1326] which is the limit of the country\r\nof Cottius. However, it is considered to be Italy from Scingomagus. And\r\nOcelum is 28 miles beyond this.\r\n\r\n4. Marseilles, founded by the Phocæans,[1327] is built in a stony\r\nregion. Its harbour lies beneath a rock, which is shaped like a theatre,\r\nand looks towards the south. It is well surrounded with walls, as well\r\nas the whole city, which is of considerable size. Within the citadel are\r\nplaced the Ephesium and the temple of the Delphian Apollo. This latter\r\ntemple is common to all the Ionians; the Ephesium is the temple\r\nconsecrated to Diana of Ephesus. They say that when the Phocæans were\r\nabout to quit their country, an oracle commanded them to take from Diana\r\nof Ephesus a conductor for their voyage. On arriving at Ephesus they\r\ntherefore inquired how they might be able to obtain from the goddess\r\nwhat was enjoined them. The goddess appeared in a dream to Aristarcha,\r\none of the most honourable women of the city, and commanded her to\r\naccompany the Phocæans, and to take with her a plan of the temple and\r\nstatues.[1328] These things being performed, and the colony being\r\nsettled, the Phocæans built a temple, and evinced their great respect\r\nfor Aristarcha by making her priestess. All the colonies [sent out from\r\nMarseilles] hold this goddess in peculiar reverence, preserving both the\r\nshape of the image [of the goddess], and also every rite observed in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n5. The Massilians live under a well-regulated aristocracy. They have a\r\ncouncil composed of 600 persons called timuchi,[1329] who enjoy this\r\ndignity for life. Fifteen of these preside over the council, and have\r\nthe management of current affairs; these fifteen are in their turn\r\npresided over by three of their number, in whom rests the principal\r\nauthority; and these again by one. No one can become a timuchus who has\r\nnot children, and who has not been a citizen for three\r\ngenerations.[1330] Their laws, which are the same as those of the\r\nIonians, they expound in public. Their country abounds in olives and\r\nvines, but on account of its ruggedness the wheat is poor. Consequently\r\nthey trust more to the resources of the sea than of the land, and avail\r\nthemselves in preference of their excellent position for commerce.\r\nNevertheless they have been enabled by the power of perseverance to take\r\nin some of the surrounding plains, and also to found cities: of this\r\nnumber are the cities they founded in Iberia as a rampart against the\r\nIberians, in which they introduced the worship of Diana of Ephesus, as\r\npractised in their fatherland, with the Grecian mode of sacrifice. In\r\nthis number too are Rhoa[1331] [and] Agatha,[1332] [built for defence]\r\nagainst the barbarians dwelling around the river Rhone; also\r\nTauroentium,[1333] Olbia,[1334] Antipolis[1335] and Nicæa,[1336] [built\r\nas a rampart] against the nation of the Salyes and the Ligurians who\r\ninhabit the Alps. They[1337] possess likewise dry docks and armouries.\r\nFormerly they had an abundance of vessels, arms, and machines, both for\r\nthe purposes of navigation and for besieging towns; by means of which\r\nthey defended themselves against the barbarians, [CAS. 180] and likewise\r\nobtained the alliance of the Romans, to whom they rendered many\r\nimportant services; the Romans in their turn assisting in their\r\naggrandizement. Sextius, who defeated the Salyes, founded, not far from\r\nMarseilles, a city[1338] which was named after him and the hot waters,\r\nsome of which they say have lost their heat.[1339] Here he established a\r\nRoman garrison, and drove from the sea-coast which leads from Marseilles\r\nto Italy the barbarians, whom the Massilians were not able to keep back\r\nentirely. However, all he accomplished by this was to compel the\r\nbarbarians to keep at a distance of twelve stadia from those parts of\r\nthe coast which possessed good harbours, and at a distance of eight\r\nstadia where it was rugged. The land which they thus abandoned, he\r\npresented to the Massilians. In their city are laid up heaps of booty\r\ntaken in naval engagements against those who disputed the sea unjustly.\r\nFormerly they enjoyed singular good fortune, as well in other matters as\r\nalso in their amity with the Romans. Of this [amity] we find numerous\r\nsigns, amongst others the statue of Diana which the Romans dedicated on\r\nthe Aventine mount, of the same figure as that of the Massilians. Their\r\nprosperity has in a great measure decayed since the war of Pompey\r\nagainst Cæsar, in which they sided with the vanquished party.\r\nNevertheless some traces of their ancient industry may still be seen\r\namongst the inhabitants, especially the making of engines of war and\r\nship-building. Still as the surrounding barbarians, now that they are\r\nunder the dominion of the Romans, become daily more civilized, and leave\r\nthe occupation of war for the business of towns and agriculture, there\r\nis no longer the same attention paid by the inhabitants of Marseilles to\r\nthese objects. The aspect of the city at the present day is a proof of\r\nthis. For all those who profess to be men of taste, turn to the study of\r\nelocution and philosophy. Thus this city for some little time back has\r\nbecome a school for the barbarians, and has communicated to the Galatæ\r\nsuch a taste for Greek literature, that they even draw contracts on the\r\nGrecian model. While at the present day it so entices the noblest of the\r\nRomans, that those desirous of studying resort thither in preference to\r\nAthens. These the Galatæ observing, and being at leisure on account of\r\nthe peace, readily devote themselves to similar pursuits, and that not\r\nmerely individuals, but the public generally; professors of the arts and\r\nsciences, and likewise of medicine, being employed not only by private\r\npersons, but by towns for common instruction. Of the wisdom of the\r\nMassilians and the simplicity of their life, the following will not be\r\nthought an insignificant proof. The largest dowry amongst them consists\r\nof one hundred gold pieces, with five for dress, and five more for\r\ngolden ornaments. More than this is not lawful. Cæsar and his successors\r\ntreated with moderation the offences of which they were guilty during\r\nthe war, in consideration of their former friendship; and have preserved\r\nto the state the right of governing according to its ancient laws. So\r\nthat neither Marseilles nor the cities dependent on it are under\r\nsubmission to the governors sent [into the Narbonnaise]. So much for\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\n6. The mountains of the Salyes incline gently from west to north in\r\nproportion as they retire from the sea. The coast runs west, and\r\nextending a short distance, about 100 stadia, from Marseilles, it begins\r\nto assume the character of a gulf at a considerable promontory near to\r\ncertain stone quarries, and extending to the Aphrodisium, the headland\r\nwhich terminates the Pyrenees,[1340] forms the Galatic Gulf,[1341] which\r\nis also called the Gulf of Marseilles: it is double, for in its circuit\r\nMount Setium[1342] stands out together with the island of Blascon,[1343]\r\nwhich is situated close to it, and separates the two gulfs. The larger\r\nof these is properly designated the Galatic Gulf, into which the Rhone\r\ndischarges itself; the smaller is on the coast of Narbonne, and extends\r\nas far as the Pyrenees. Narbonne is situated above the [CAS. 181]\r\noutlets of the Aude[1344] and the lake of Narbonne.[1345] It is the\r\nprincipal commercial city on this coast. On the Rhone is Arelate,[1346]\r\na city and emporium of considerable traffic. The distance between these\r\ntwo cities is nearly equal to that which separates them from the\r\naforesaid promontories, namely, Narbonne from the Aphrodisium, and\r\nArelate from the cape of Marseilles. There are other rivers besides\r\nwhich flow on either side of Narbonne, some from the Cevennes, others\r\nfrom the Pyrenees. Along these rivers are situated cities having but\r\nlittle commerce, and that in small vessels. The rivers which proceed\r\nfrom the Pyrenees, are the Tet[1347] and the Tech;[1348] two\r\ncities[1349] are built on them, which bear respectively the same name as\r\nthe rivers. There is a lake near to Ruscino,[1350] and a little above\r\nthe sea a marshy district full of salt-springs, which supplies “dug\r\nmullets,” for whoever digs two or three feet and plunges a trident into\r\nthe muddy water, will be sure to take the fish, which are worthy of\r\nconsideration on account of their size; they are nourished in the mud\r\nlike eels. Such are the rivers which flow from the Pyrenees between\r\nNarbonne and the promontory on which is built the temple of Venus. On\r\nthe other side of Narbonne the following rivers descend from the\r\nCevennes into the sea. The Aude,[1351] the Orbe,[1352] and the\r\nRauraris.[1353] On one of these[1354] is situated the strong city of\r\nBætera,[1355] near to Narbonne; on the other Agatha,[1356] founded by\r\nthe people of Marseilles.\r\n\r\n7. Of one marvel of this sea-coast, namely the “dug mullets,” we have\r\nalready spoken; we will now mention another, even more surprising.\r\nBetween Marseilles and the outlets of the Rhone there is a circular\r\nplain, about 100 stadia distant from the sea, and about 100 stadia in\r\ndiameter. It has received the name of the Stony Plain, from the\r\ncircumstance of its being covered with stones the size of the fist, from\r\nbeneath which an abundant herbage springs up for the pasturage of\r\ncattle. In the midst of it are water, salt-springs, and salt. The whole\r\nboth of this district and that above it is exposed to the wind, but in\r\nthis plain the black north,[1357] a violent and horrible wind, rages\r\nespecially: for they say that sometimes the stones are swept and rolled\r\nalong, and men hurled from their carriages and stripped both of their\r\narms and garments by the force of the tempest. Aristotle tells us that\r\nthese stones being cast up by the earthquakes designated\r\n_brastai_,[1358] and falling on the surface of the earth, roll into the\r\nhollow places of the districts; but Posidonius, that the place was\r\nformerly a lake, which being congealed during a violent agitation,\r\nbecame divided into numerous stones, like river pebbles or the stones by\r\nthe sea-shore, which they resemble both as to smoothness, size, and\r\nappearance. Such are the causes assigned by these two [writers];\r\nhowever, neither of their opinions is credible,[1359] for these stones\r\ncould neither have thus accumulated of themselves, nor yet have been\r\nformed by congealed moisture, but necessarily from the fragments of\r\nlarge stones shattered by frequent convulsions. Æschylus having,\r\nhowever, learnt of the difficulty of accounting for it, or having been\r\nso informed by another, has explained it away as a myth. He makes\r\nPrometheus utter the following, whilst directing Hercules the road from\r\nthe Caucasus to the Hesperides:\r\n\r\n   “There you will come to the undaunted army of the Ligurians,\r\n   where, resistless though you be, sure am I you will not worst\r\n   them in battle; for it is fated that there your darts shall fail\r\n   you; nor will you be able to take up a stone from the ground,\r\n   since the country consists of soft mould; but Jupiter, beholding\r\n   your distress, will compassionate you, and overshadowing the\r\n   earth with a cloud, he will cause it to hail round stones, which\r\n   you hurling against the Ligurian army, will soon put them to\r\n   flight!”[1360]\r\n\r\nPosidonius asks, would it not have been better to have rained [CAS. 183]\r\ndown these stones upon the Ligurians themselves, and thus have destroyed\r\nthem all, than to make Hercules in need of so many stones? As for the\r\nnumber, they were necessary against so vast a multitude; so that in this\r\nrespect the writer of the myth seems to me deserving of more credit than\r\nhe who would refute it. Further, the poet, in describing it as fated,\r\nsecures himself against such fault-finding. For if you dispute\r\nProvidence and Destiny, you can find many similar things both in human\r\naffairs and nature, that you would suppose might be much better\r\nperformed in this or that way; as for instance, that Egypt should have\r\nplenty of rain of its own, without being irrigated from the land of\r\nEthiopia. That it would have been much better if Paris had suffered\r\nshipwreck on his voyage to Sparta, instead of expiating his offences\r\nafter having carried off Helen, and having been the cause of so great\r\ndestruction both amongst the Greeks and Barbarians. Euripides attributes\r\nthis to Jupiter:\r\n\r\n   “Father Jupiter, willing evil to the Trojans and suffering to the\r\n   Greeks, decreed such things.”\r\n\r\n8. As to the mouths of the Rhone, Polybius asserts that there are but\r\ntwo, and blames Timæus[1361] for saying five. Artemidorus says that\r\nthere are three. Afterwards Marius, observing that the mouth was\r\nbecoming stopped up and difficult of entrance on account of the deposits\r\nof mud, caused a new channel to be dug, which received the greater part\r\nof the river into it.[1362] This he gave to the people of Marseilles in\r\nrecompense for their services in the war against the Ambrones and\r\nToygeni.[1363] This canal became to them a source of much revenue, as\r\nthey levied a toll from all those who sailed up or down it:\r\nnotwithstanding, the entrance [to the river] still continues difficult\r\nto navigate, on account of its great impetuosity, its deposits, and the\r\n[general] flatness of the country, so that in foul weather you cannot\r\nclearly discern the land even when quite close. On this account the\r\npeople of Marseilles, who wished by all means to inhabit the country,\r\nset up towers as beacons; they have even erected a temple to Diana of\r\nEphesus on a piece of the land, which the mouths of the rivers have\r\nformed into an island. Above the outlets of the Rhone is a salt-lake\r\nwhich they call Stomalimnè.[1364] It abounds in shell and other fish.\r\nThere are some who enumerate this amongst the mouths of the Rhone,\r\nespecially those who say that it has seven[1365] mouths. But in this\r\nthey are quite mistaken; for there is a mountain between, which\r\nseparates the lake from the river. Such then is the disposition and\r\nextent of the coast from the Pyrenees to Marseilles.\r\n\r\n9. The [coast] which extends from this [last city] to the river Var, and\r\nthe Ligurians who dwell near it, contains the Massilian cities of\r\nTauroentium,[1366] Olbia,[1367] Antipolis,[1368] Nicæa,[1369] and the\r\nsea-port of Augustus Cæsar, called Forum Julium,[1370] which is situated\r\nbetween Olbia and Antipolis, and distant from Marseilles about 600\r\nstadia. The Var is between Antipolis and Nicæa; distant from the one\r\nabout 20 stadia, from the other about 60; so that according to the\r\nboundary now marked Nicæa belongs to Italy, although it is a city of the\r\npeople of Marseilles, for they built these cities [as a defence] against\r\nthe barbarians who dwelt higher up the country, in order to maintain the\r\nsea free, as the barbarians possessed the land. For this [region] is\r\nmountainous and fortified by nature, leaving however a considerable\r\nextent of plain country near Marseilles; but as you proceed towards the\r\neast the country is so hemmed in by the mountains, as scarcely to leave\r\na sufficient road for passage by the sea-shore. The former districts are\r\ninhabited by the Salyes,[1371] the latter by the Ligurians, who border\r\non Italy, of whom we shall speak afterwards. It should here be\r\nmentioned, that although Antipolis is situated in the Narbonnaise, and\r\nNicæa in Italy, this latter is dependent on Marseilles, and forms part\r\nof that province; while [CAS. 184] Antipolis is ranked amongst the\r\nItalian cities, and freed from the government of the Marseillese by a\r\njudgment given against them.\r\n\r\n10. Lying off this narrow pass along the coast, as you commence your\r\njourney from Marseilles, are the Stœchades islands.[1372] Three of these\r\nare considerable, and two small. They are cultivated by the people of\r\nMarseilles. Anciently they contained a garrison, placed here to defend\r\nthem from the attacks of pirates, for they have good ports. After the\r\nStœchades come [the islands of] Planasia[1373] and Lero,[1374] both of\r\nthem inhabited. In Lero, which lies opposite to Antipolis, is a temple\r\nerected to the hero Lero. There are other small islands not worth\r\nmentioning, some of them before Marseilles, others before the rest of\r\nthe coast which I have been describing. As to the harbours, those of the\r\nsea-port [of Forum-Julium][1375] and Marseilles are considerable, the\r\nothers are but middling. Of this latter class is the port Oxybius,[1376]\r\nso named from the Oxybian Ligurians.—This concludes what we have to say\r\nof this coast.\r\n\r\n11. The country above this is bounded principally by the surrounding\r\nmountains and rivers. Of these the Rhone is the most remarkable, being\r\nboth the largest, and capable of being navigated farther than any of the\r\nothers, and also receiving into it a greater number of tributaries; of\r\nthese we must speak in order. Commencing at Marseilles, and proceeding\r\nto the country between the Alps and the Rhone, to the river Durance,\r\ndwell the Salyes for a space of 500 stadia. From thence you proceed in a\r\nferry-boat to the city of Caballio;[1377] beyond this the whole country\r\nbelongs to the Cavari as far as the junction of the Isère with the\r\nRhone; it is here too that the Cevennes approach the Rhone. From the\r\nDurance to this point is a distance of 700 stadia.[1378] The Salyes\r\noccupy the plains and mountains above these. The Vocontii, Tricorii,\r\nIconii, and Medylli, lie above the Cavari.[1379] Between the Durance and\r\nthe Isère there are other rivers which flow from the Alps into the\r\nRhone; two of these, after having flowed round the city of the Cavari,\r\ndischarge themselves by a common outlet into the Rhone. The\r\nSulgas,[1380] which is the third, mixes with the Rhone near the city of\r\nVindalum,[1381] where Cnæus Ænobarbus in a decisive engagement routed\r\nmany myriads of the Kelts. Between these are the cities of Avenio,[1382]\r\nArausio,[1383] and Aëria,[1384] which latter, remarks Artemidorus, is\r\nrightly named aërial, being situated in a very lofty position. The whole\r\nof this country consists of plains abounding in pasturage, excepting on\r\nthe route from Aëria to Avenio, where there are narrow defiles and woods\r\nto traverse. It was at the point where the river Isère and the Rhone\r\nunite near the Cevennes, that Quintus Fabius Maximus Æmilianus,[1385]\r\nwith scarcely 30,000 men, cut to pieces 200,000 Kelts.[1386] Here he\r\nerected a white stone as a trophy, and two temples, one to Mars, and the\r\nother to Hercules. From the Isère to Vienne, the metropolis of the\r\nAllobroges, situated on the Rhone, the distance is 320 stadia.\r\nLugdunum[1387] is a little above Vienne at the confluence of the\r\nSaone[1388] and the Rhone. The distance by land [from this latter city]\r\nto Lugdunum, passing through the country of the Allobroges, is about 200\r\nstadia, and rather more by water. Formerly the Allobroges engaged in\r\nwar, their armies consisting of many myriads; they now occupy themselves\r\nin cultivating the plains and valleys of the Alps. They dwell generally\r\nin villages, the most notable of them inhabiting Vienne, which was\r\nmerely a village, although called the metropolis of their nation; they\r\nhave now improved and embellished it as a city; it is situated on the\r\nRhone. So full and rapid is the descent of this river from the Alps,\r\nthat the flow of its waters through Lake Leman may be distinguished for\r\nmany stadia. Having descended into the plains of the countries of the\r\nAllobroges, and Segusii, it falls into the Saone, near to Lugdunum, a\r\ncity of the Segusii.[1389] The [CAS. 186] Saone rises in the Alps,[1390]\r\nand separates the Sequani, the Ædui, and the Lincasii.[1391] It\r\nafterwards receives the Doubs, a navigable river which rises in the same\r\nmountains,[1392] still however preserving its own name, and consisting\r\nof the two, mingles with the Rhone. The Rhone in like manner preserves\r\nits name, and flows on to Vienne. At their rise these three rivers flow\r\ntowards the north, then in a westerly direction, afterwards uniting into\r\none they take another turn and flow towards the south, and having\r\nreceived other rivers, they flow in this direction to the sea. Such is\r\nthe country situated between the Alps and the Rhone.\r\n\r\n12. The main part of the country on the other side of the Rhone is\r\ninhabited by the Volcæ, surnamed Arecomisci. Their naval station is\r\nNarbonne, which may justly be called the emporium of all Gaul, as it far\r\nsurpasses every other in the multitude of those who resort[1393] to it.\r\nThe Volcæ border on the Rhone, the Salyes and Cavari being opposite to\r\nthem on the other side of the river. However, the name of the Cavari has\r\nso obtained, that all the barbarians inhabiting near now go by that\r\ndesignation; nay, even those who are no longer barbarians, but follow\r\nthe Roman customs, both in their speech and mode of life, and some of\r\nthose even who have adopted the Roman polity. Between the Arecomisci and\r\nthe Pyrenees there are some other small and insignificant nations.\r\nNemausus[1394] is the metropolis of the Arecomisci; though far inferior\r\nto Narbonne both as to its commerce, and the number of foreigners\r\nattracted thither, it surpasses that city in the number of its citizens;\r\nfor it has under its dominion four and twenty different villages all\r\nwell inhabited, and by the same people, who pay tribute; it likewise\r\nenjoys the rights of the Latin towns, so that in Nemausus you meet with\r\nRoman citizens who have obtained the honours of the ædile and\r\nquæstorship, wherefore this nation is not subject to the orders issued\r\nby the prætors from Rome. The city is situated on the road from Iberia to\r\nItaly; this road is very good in the summer, but muddy and overflowed by\r\nthe rivers during winter and spring. Some of these streams are crossed\r\nin ferry-boats, and others by means of bridges constructed either of\r\nwood or stone. The inundations which destroy the roads are caused by the\r\nwinter torrents, which sometimes pour down from the Alps even in\r\nsummer-time after the melting of the snows. To perform the route before\r\nmentioned, the shortest way is, as we have said, across the territory of\r\nthe Vocontii direct to the Alps; the other, along the coast of\r\nMarseilles and Liguria, is longer, although it offers an easier passage\r\ninto Italy, as the mountains are lower. Nemausus is about 100 stadia\r\ndistant from the Rhone, situated opposite to the small town of Tarascon,\r\nand about 720 stadia from Narbonne. The Tectosages,[1395] and certain\r\nothers whom we shall mention afterwards, border on the range of the\r\nCevennes, and inhabit its southern side as far as the promontory of the\r\nVolcæ. Respecting all the others we will speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n13. But the Tectosages dwell near to the Pyrenees, bordering for a small\r\nspace the northern side of the Cevennes;[1396] the land they inhabit is\r\nrich in gold. It appears that formerly they were so powerful and\r\nnumerous, that dissensions having arisen amongst them, they drove a vast\r\nmultitude of their number from their homes; and that these men\r\nassociating with others of different nations took possession of Phrygia,\r\nnext to Cappadocia, and the Paphlagonians. Of this those who are now\r\ncalled the Tectosages afford us proof, for [Phrygia contains] three\r\nnations, one of them dwelling near to the city of Ancyra,[1397] being\r\ncalled the Tectosages; the remaining two, the Trocmi and\r\nTolistobogii.[1398] The resemblance these nations bear to the Tectosages\r\nis evidence of their having immigrated from Keltica, though we are\r\nunable to say from which district they came, as there does not appear to\r\nbe any people at the present time bearing the name of Trocmi or\r\nTolistobogii, who [CAS. 188] inhabit either beyond the Alps, the Alps\r\nthemselves, or on this side the Alps. It would seem that continual\r\nemigration has drained them completely from their native country, a\r\ncircumstance which has occurred to many other nations, as some say that\r\nthe Brennus, who led an expedition to Delphi,[1399] was a leader of the\r\nPrausi; but we are unable to say where the Prausi formerly inhabited. It\r\nis said that the Tectosages took part in the expedition to Delphi, and\r\nthat the treasures found in the city of Toulouse by the Roman general\r\nCæpio formed a portion of the booty gained there, which was afterwards\r\nincreased by offerings which the citizens made from their own property,\r\nand consecrated in order to conciliate the god.[1400] And that it was\r\nfor daring to touch these that Cæpio terminated so miserably his\r\nexistence, being driven from his country as a plunderer of the temples\r\nof the gods, and leaving behind him his daughters, who, as Timagenes\r\ninforms us, having been wickedly violated, perished miserably. However,\r\nthe account given by Posidonius is the more credible. He tells us that\r\nthe wealth found in Toulouse amounted to somewhere about 15,000 talents,\r\na part of which was hidden in the chapels, and the remainder in the\r\nsacred lakes, and that it was not coined [money], but gold and silver in\r\nbullion. But at this time the temple of Delphi was emptied of these\r\ntreasures, having been pillaged by the Phocæans at the period of the\r\nSacred war; and supposing any to have been left, it would have been\r\ndistributed amongst many. Nor is it probable that the Tectosages\r\nreturned home, since they came off miserably after leaving Delphi, and\r\nowing to their dissensions were scattered here and there throughout the\r\ncountry; there is much more likelihood in the statement made by\r\nPosidonius and many others, that the country abounding in gold, and the\r\ninhabitants being superstitious, and not living expensively, they hid\r\ntheir treasures in many different places, the lakes in particular\r\naffording them a hiding-place for depositing their gold and silver\r\nbullion. When the Romans obtained possession of the country they put up\r\nthese lakes to public sale, and many of the purchasers found therein\r\nsolid masses of silver. In Toulouse there was a sacred temple, held in\r\ngreat reverence by the inhabitants of the surrounding country, and on\r\nthis account loaded with riches, inasmuch as there were many who offered\r\ngifts, and no one dared to touch them.\r\n\r\n14. Toulouse is situated upon the narrowest part of the isthmus which\r\nseparates the ocean from the sea of Narbonne; the breadth of the\r\n[isthmus], according to Posidonius, being less than 3000 stadia. The\r\nperfect similarity maintained throughout this country both in respect to\r\nits rivers, and to the exterior and interior sea,[1401] appears to us\r\nworthy of especial notice, as we have said before. This, on reflection,\r\nwill prove to be one main cause of the excellence of this country, since\r\nthe inhabitants are enabled mutually to communicate, and to procure from\r\neach other the necessaries of life; this is peculiarly the case at the\r\npresent time, when on account of their leisure from war they are\r\ndevoting themselves to agriculture and the pursuits of social life. In\r\nthis we are persuaded that we behold the work of Providence; such a\r\ndisposition of these regions not resulting from chance, but from the\r\nthought of some [intelligence]. The Rhone, for instance, is navigable to\r\na considerable distance for vessels of heavy burden, which it is capable\r\nof transmitting through various districts of the country by means of\r\nother rivers which fall into it, and are likewise fitted for the\r\nnavigation of large vessels. To the Rhone succeeds the Saone,[1402] and\r\ninto this latter river falls the Doubs; thence the merchandise is\r\ncarried by land to the river Seine; whence it is transported to the\r\nocean and the [countries of the] Lexovii and Caleti,[1403] the distance\r\nthence to Britain being less than a day’s journey. The navigation of the\r\nRhone being difficult on account of the rapidity of its current, the\r\nmerchants prefer to transport in waggons certain of their wares, which\r\nare destined for the Arverni,[1404] and the river Loire,[1405]\r\nnotwithstanding the vicinity of the Rhone in some places, but the road\r\nbeing level and the distance not far, (about 800 stadia,) they do not\r\nmake use of water carriage on account of the [CAS. 189] facility of the\r\ntransport by land, from thence the merchandise is easily conveyed by the\r\nLoire. This river flows from the Cevennes into the ocean. From Narbonne\r\nthe voyage to the Aude[1406] is short, but the journey by land to the\r\nriver Garonne longer, being as much as 700 or 800 stadia. The Garonne\r\nlikewise flows into the ocean. Such is what we have to say concerning\r\nthe inhabitants of the Narbonnaise, who were formerly named Kelts. In my\r\nopinion the celebrity of the Kelts induced the Grecians to confer that\r\nname on the whole of the Galatæ; the vicinity of the Massilians may also\r\nhave had something to do with it.[1407]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We must now speak of the Aquitani and the fourteen Galatic nations\r\npertaining to them, situated between the Garonne and the Loire, some of\r\nwhich extend to the river Rhone and the plains of the Narbonnaise.\r\nGenerally speaking, the Aquitani may be said to differ from the Galatic\r\nrace, both as to form of body and language, resembling more nearly the\r\nIberians. They are bounded by the Garonne, and dwell between this river\r\nand the Pyrenees. There are above twenty nations which bear the name of\r\nAquitani, small and obscure, the major part of them dwelling by the\r\nocean, and the remainder in the interior and by the extremities of the\r\nCevennes, as far as the Tectosages. This district, however, being too\r\nsmall, they added to it the territory between the Garonne and the Loire.\r\nThese rivers are nearly parallel with the Pyrenees, and form with them\r\ntwo parallelograms, bounded on the remaining sides by the ocean and the\r\nmountains of the Cevennes.[1408] Both of these rivers are navigable for\r\na distance of about 2000 stadia.[1409] The Garonne, after being\r\naugmented by three other rivers,[1410] discharges itself into the\r\n[ocean] between the [country] of the Bituriges, surnamed the\r\nVivisci,[1411] and that of the Santoni;[1412] both of them Gallic\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe Bituriges are the only foreign people who dwell among the Aquitani\r\nwithout forming a part of them. Their emporium is Burdegala,[1413]\r\nsituated on a creek formed by the outlets of the river. The Loire\r\ndischarges itself between the Pictones and the Namnetæ.[1414] Formerly\r\nthere was an emporium on this river named Corbilon, mentioned by\r\nPolybius when speaking of the fictions of Pytheas. “The Marseillese,\r\n[says he,] when interrogated by Scipio[1415] at their meeting, had\r\nnothing to tell about Britain worth mentioning, nor yet had the people\r\nof the Narbonnaise, nor those of Corbilon; notwithstanding these were\r\nthe two principal cities of the district, Pytheas alone dared to forge\r\nso many lies [concerning that island].” Mediolanium[1416] is the capital\r\nof the Santoni. The part of Aquitaine next the ocean is for the most\r\npart sandy and meagre, producing millet, but barren of all other fruits.\r\nHere is the gulf which, with that on the coast of Narbonne, forms the\r\nisthmus. Both these gulfs[1417] go by the name of the Galatic gulf. The\r\nformer gulf belongs to the Tarbelli.[1418] These people possess the\r\nrichest gold mines; masses of gold as big as the fist can contain, and\r\nrequiring hardly any purifying, [CAS. 190] being found in diggings\r\nscarcely beneath the surface of the earth, the remainder consisting\r\nof dust and lumps, which likewise require but little working. In the\r\ninterior and mountainous parts [of Aquitaine] the soil is superior;\r\nfor instance, in the district near the Pyrenees belonging to the\r\nConvenæ,[1419] which name signifies people assembled from different\r\ncountries to dwell in one place. Here is the city of Lugdunum,[1420]\r\nand the hot springs of the Onesii,[1421] which are most excellent for\r\ndrinking. The country of the Auscii[1422] likewise is fine.\r\n\r\n2. The nations between the Garonne and the Loire annexed to the\r\nAquitani, are the Elui,[1423] who commence at the Rhone. After these the\r\nVellæi,[1424] who were formerly comprehended amongst the Arverni,[1425]\r\nbut now form a people to themselves. After these Arverni come the\r\nLemovices,[1426] and Petrocorii,[1427] and after them the\r\nNitiobriges,[1427] the Cadurci,[1427] and the Bituriges,[1427] surnamed\r\nCubi. Along the ocean we meet with the Santoni, and Pictones,[1428] the\r\nformer dwelling by the Garonne, as we have stated, and the latter by the\r\nLoire. The Ruteni and the Gabales[1429] are in the vicinity of the\r\nNarbonnaise. The Petrocorii and Bituriges-Cubi possess excellent\r\niron-works, the Cadurci linen-factories, and the Ruteni silver-mines:\r\nthe Gabales likewise possess silver-mines. On certain amongst the\r\nAquitani the Romans have conferred the rights of Latin cities; such for\r\ninstance as the Auscii, and the Convenæ.\r\n\r\n3. The Arverni are situated along the Loire. Nemossus, their metropolis,\r\nis built on the same river.[1430] This river having flowed past\r\nGenabum,[1431] an emporium of the Carnutes,[1432] situated about the\r\nmiddle of its course, discharges itself into the ocean. A great proof of\r\nthe former power of the Arverni, is the fact of the frequent wars which\r\nthey sustained against the Romans, sometimes with armies of 200,000\r\nmen, and sometimes with double that number, which was the amount of\r\ntheir force when they fought against divus Cæsar under the command of\r\nVercingetorix.[1433] Before this they had brought 200,000 men against\r\nMaximus Æmilianus, and the same number against Domitius Ænobarbus. Their\r\nbattles with Cæsar took place, one in Gergovia,[1434] a city of the\r\nArverni situated on a lofty mountain, the birth-place of Vercingetorix;\r\nthe other, near to Alesia,[1435] a city of the Mandubii, who border on\r\nthe Arverni; this city is likewise situated on a high hill, surrounded\r\nby mountains, and between two rivers. Here the war was terminated by the\r\ncapture of their leader. The battle with Maximus Æmilianus was fought\r\nnear the confluence of the Isère and the Rhone, at the point where the\r\nmountains of the Cevennes approach the latter river. That with Domitius\r\nwas fought lower down at the confluence of the Sulgas[1436] and the\r\nRhone. The Arverni extended their dominion as far as Narbonne and the\r\nborders of Marseilles, and exercised authority over the nations as far\r\nas the Pyrenees, the ocean, and the Rhine. Luerius,[1437] the father of\r\nBituitus who fought against Maximus and Domitius, is said to have been\r\nso distinguished by his riches and luxury, that to give a proof of his\r\nopulence to his friends, he caused himself to be dragged across a plain\r\nin a car, whilst he scattered gold and silver coin in every direction\r\nfor those who followed him to gather up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Next in order after Aquitaine and the Narbonnaise, is that portion\r\n[of Gaul] extending as far as the Rhine from [CAS. 191] the river Loire,\r\nand the Rhone, where it passes by Lugdunum:[1438] in its descent from\r\nits source. The upper regions of this district from the sources of the\r\nRhine and Rhone, nearly to the middle of the plains, pertain to\r\nLugdunum; the remainder, with the regions next the ocean, is comprised\r\nin another division which belongs to the Belgæ. We will describe the two\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n2. Lugdunum itself, situated on[1439] a hill, at the confluence of the\r\nSaone[1440] and the Rhone, belongs to the Romans. It is the most\r\npopulous city after Narbonne. It carries on a great commerce, and the\r\nRoman prefects here coin both gold and silver money. Before this city,\r\nat the confluence of the rivers, is situated the temple dedicated by all\r\nthe Galatæ in common to Cæsar Augustus. The altar is splendid, and has\r\ninscribed on it the names of sixty people, and images of them, one for\r\neach, and also another great altar.[1441]\r\n\r\nThis is the principal city of the nation of the Segusiani who lie\r\nbetween the Rhone and the Doubs.[1442] The other nations who extend to\r\nthe Rhine, are bounded in part by the Doubs, and in part by the Saone.\r\nThese two rivers, as said before, descend from the Alps, and, falling\r\ninto one stream, flow into the Rhone. There is likewise another river\r\nwhich has its sources in the Alps, and is named the Seine.[1443] It\r\nflows parallel with the Rhine, through a nation bearing the same name as\r\nitself,[1444] and so into the ocean. The Sequani are bounded on the east\r\nby the Rhine, and on the opposite side by the Saone. It is from them\r\nthat the Romans procure the finest salted-pork. Between the Doubs and\r\nSaone dwells the nation of the Ædui, who possess the city of\r\nCabyllinum,[1445] situated on the Saone and the fortress of\r\nBibracte.[1446] The Ædui[1447] are said to be related to the Romans,\r\nand they were the first to enter into friendship and alliance with them.\r\nOn the other side of the Saone dwell the Sequani, who have for long been\r\nat enmity with the Romans and Ædui, having frequently allied themselves\r\nwith the Germans in their incursions into Italy. It was then that they\r\nproved their strength, for united to them the Germans were powerful, but\r\nwhen separated, weak. As for the Ædui, their alliance with the Romans\r\nnaturally rendered them the enemies of the Sequani,[1448] but the enmity\r\nwas increased by their contests concerning the river which divides them,\r\neach nation claiming the Saone exclusively for themselves, and likewise\r\nthe tolls on vessels passing. However, at the present time, the whole of\r\nit is under the dominion of the Romans.\r\n\r\n3. The first of all the nations dwelling on the Rhine are the Helvetii,\r\namongst whom are the sources of that river in Mount Adula,[1449] which\r\nforms part of the Alps. From this mountain, but in an opposite\r\ndirection, likewise proceeds the Adda, which flows towards Cisalpine\r\nGaul, and fills lake Larius,[1450] near to which stands [the city of]\r\nComo; thence it discharges itself into the Po, of which we shall speak\r\nafterwards. The Rhine also flows into vast marshes and a great\r\nlake,[1451] which borders on the Rhæti and Vindelici,[1452] who dwell\r\npartly in the Alps, and partly beyond the Alps. Asinius says that the\r\nlength of this river is 6000 stadia, but such is not the case, for taken\r\nin a straight line it does not much exceed half that length, and 1000\r\nstadia is quite sufficient to allow for its sinuosities. In fact this\r\nriver is so rapid that it is difficult to throw bridges across it,\r\nalthough after its descent from the mountains it is borne the remainder\r\nof the way through level plains; now how could it maintain its rapidity\r\nand vehemence, if in addition to this level channel, we suppose it also\r\nto have long and frequent tortuosities? Asinius [CAS. 193] likewise\r\nasserts that this river has two mouths, and blames those who say that it\r\nhas more.[1453] This river and the Seine embrace within their\r\ntortuosities a certain extent of country, which however is not\r\nconsiderable. They both flow from south to north. Britain lies opposite\r\nto them; but nearest to the Rhine, from which you may see Kent, which is\r\nthe most easterly part of the island. The Seine is a little further. It\r\nwas here that divus Cæsar established a dock-yard when he sailed to\r\nBritain. The navigable portion of the Seine, commencing from the point\r\nwhere they receive the merchandise from the Saone, is of greater extent\r\nthan the [navigable portions] of the Loire and Garonne. From\r\nLugdunum[1454] to the Seine is [a distance of] 1000 stadia, and not\r\ntwice this distance from the outlets of the Rhone to Lugdunum. They say\r\nthat the Helvetii,[1455] though rich in gold, nevertheless devoted\r\nthemselves to pillage on beholding the wealth of the Cimbri,[1456]\r\n[accumulated by that means;] and that two out of their three tribes\r\nperished entirely in their military expeditions. However, the multitude\r\nof descendants who sprang from this remainder was proved in their war\r\nwith divus Cæsar, in which about 400,000 of their number were destroyed;\r\nthe 8000 who survived the war, being spared by the conqueror, that their\r\ncountry might not be left desert, a prey to the neighbouring\r\nGermans.[1457]\r\n\r\n4. After the Helvetii, the Sequani[1458] and Mediomatrici[1459] dwell\r\nalong the Rhine, amongst whom are the Tribocchi,[1460] a German nation\r\nwho emigrated from their country hither. Mount Jura, which is in the\r\ncountry of the Sequani, separates that people from the Helvetii. To the\r\nwest, above the Helvetii and Sequani, dwell the Ædui and Lingones; the\r\nLeuci and a part of the Lingones dwelling above the Mediomatrici. The\r\nnations between the Loire and the Seine, and beyond the Rhone and the\r\nSaone, are situated to the north near to the Allobroges,[1461] and the\r\nparts about Lyons. The most celebrated amongst them are the Arverni and\r\nCarnutes,[1462] through both of whose territories the Loire flows before\r\ndischarging itself into the ocean. The distance from the rivers of\r\nKeltica to Britain is 320 stadia; for departing in the evening with the\r\nebb tide, you will arrive on the morrow at the island about the eighth\r\nhour.[1463] After the Mediomatrici and Tribocchi, the Treviri[1464]\r\ninhabit along the Rhine; in their country the Roman generals now engaged\r\nin the German war have constructed a bridge. Opposite this place on the\r\nother bank of the river dwelt the Ubii, whom Agrippa with their own\r\nconsent brought over to this side the Rhine.[1465] The Nervii,[1466]\r\nanother German nation, are contiguous to the Treviri; and last the\r\nMenapii, who inhabit either bank of the river near to its outlets; they\r\ndwell amongst marshes and forests, not lofty, but consisting of dense\r\nand thorny wood. Near to these dwell the Sicambri,[1467] who are\r\nlikewise Germans. The country next the whole [eastern] bank is inhabited\r\nby the Suevi, who are also named Germans, but are superior both in power\r\nand number to the others, whom they drove out, and who have now taken\r\nrefuge on this side the Rhine. Other tribes have sway in different\r\nplaces; they are successively a prey to the flames of war, the former\r\ninhabitants for the most part being destroyed.\r\n\r\n5. The Senones, the Remi, the Atrebates, and the Eburones dwell west of\r\nthe Treviri and Nervii.[1468] Close to the Menapii and near the sea are\r\nthe Morini, the Bellovaci, the Ambiani, the Suessiones, and the Caleti,\r\nas far as the outlet [CAS. 194] of the river Seine.[1469] The countries\r\nof the Morini, the Atrebates, and the Eburones are similar to that of\r\nthe Menapii. It consists of a forest filled with low trees; of great\r\nextent, but not near so large as writers have described it, viz. 4000\r\nstadia.[1470] It is named Arduenna.[1471] In the event of warlike\r\nincursions the inhabitants would interweave the flexible brambly shrubs,\r\nthus stopping up the passages [into their country]. They also fixed\r\nstakes in various places, and then retreated with their whole families\r\ninto the recesses of the forest, to small islands surrounded by marshes.\r\nDuring the rainy season these proved secure hiding-places, but in times\r\nof drought they were easily taken. However, at the present time all the\r\nnations on this side the Rhine[1472] dwell in peace under the dominion\r\nof the Romans. The Parisii dwell along the river Seine, and inhabit an\r\nisland formed by the river; their city is Lucotecia.[1473] The Meldi and\r\nLexovii border on the ocean. The most considerable, however, of all\r\nthese nations are the Remi. Duricortora, their metropolis, is well\r\npopulated, and is the residence of the Roman prefects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGAUL. THE BELGÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After the nations mentioned come those of the Belgæ, who dwell next\r\nthe ocean. Of their number are the Veneti,[1474] who fought a naval\r\nbattle with Cæsar. They had prepared to resist his passage into Britain,\r\nbeing possessed of the commerce [of that island] themselves. But Cæsar\r\neasily gained the victory, not however by means of his beaks, (for their\r\nships were constructed of solid wood,)[1475] but whenever their ships\r\nwere borne near to his by the wind, the Romans rent the sails by means\r\nof scythes fixed on long handles:[1476] for the sails [of their ships]\r\nare made of leather to resist the violence of the winds, and managed by\r\nchains instead of cables. They construct their vessels with broad\r\nbottoms and high poops and prows, on account of the tides. They are\r\nbuilt of the wood of the oak, of which there is abundance. On this\r\naccount, instead of fitting the planks close together, they leave\r\ninterstices between them; these they fill with sea-weed to prevent the\r\nwood from drying up in dock for want of moisture; for the sea-weed is\r\ndamp by nature, but the oak dry and arid. In my opinion these Veneti\r\nwere the founders of the Veneti in the Adriatic, for almost all the\r\nother Keltic nations in Italy have passed over from the country beyond\r\nthe Alps, as for instance, the Boii[1477] and Senones.[1478] They are\r\nsaid to be Paphlagonians merely on account of a similarity of name.\r\nHowever, I do not maintain my opinion positively; for in these matters\r\nprobability is quite sufficient. The Osismii are the people whom Pytheas\r\ncalls Ostimii; they dwell on a promontory which projects considerably\r\ninto the ocean, but not so far as Pytheas and those who follow him\r\nassert.[1479] As for the nations between the Seine and the Loire, some\r\nare contiguous to the Sequani, others to the Arverni.\r\n\r\n2. The entire race which now goes by the name of Gallic, or\r\nGalatic,[1480] is warlike, passionate, and always ready for fighting,\r\nbut otherwise simple and not malicious. If irritated, they rush in\r\ncrowds to the conflict, openly and without any circumspection; and thus\r\nare easily vanquished by those who employ stratagem. For any one may\r\nexasperate them when, where, and under whatever pretext he pleases; he\r\nwill [CAS. 196] always find them ready for danger, with nothing to\r\nsupport them except their violence and daring. Nevertheless they may be\r\neasily persuaded to devote themselves to any thing useful, and have thus\r\nengaged both in science and letters. Their power consists both in the\r\nsize of their bodies and also in their numbers. Their frankness and\r\nsimplicity lead them easily to assemble in masses, each one feeling\r\nindignant at what appears injustice to his neighbour. At the present\r\ntime indeed they are all at peace, being in subjection and living under\r\nthe command of the Romans, who have subdued them; but we have described\r\ntheir customs as we understand they existed in former times, and as they\r\nstill exist amongst the Germans. These two nations, both by nature and\r\nin their form of government, are similar and related to each other.\r\nTheir countries border on each other, being separated by the river\r\nRhine, and are for the most part similar. Germany, however, is more to\r\nthe north, if we compare together the southern and northern parts of the\r\ntwo countries respectively. Thus it is that they can so easily change\r\ntheir abode. They march in crowds in one collected army, or rather\r\nremove with all their families, whenever they are ejected by a more\r\npowerful force. They were subdued by the Romans much more easily than\r\nthe Iberians; for they began to wage war with these latter first, and\r\nceased last, having in the mean time conquered the whole of the nations\r\nsituated between the Rhine and the mountains of the Pyrenees. For these\r\nfighting in crowds and vast numbers, were overthrown in crowds, whereas\r\nthe Iberians kept themselves in reserve, and broke up the war into a\r\nseries of petty engagements, showing themselves in different bands,\r\nsometimes here, sometimes there, like banditti. All the Gauls are\r\nwarriors by nature, but they fight better on horseback than on foot, and\r\nthe flower of the Roman cavalry is drawn from their number. The most\r\nvaliant of them dwell towards the north and next the ocean.\r\n\r\n3. Of these they say that the Belgæ are the bravest. They are divided\r\ninto fifteen nations, and dwell near the ocean between the Rhine and the\r\nLoire, and have therefore sustained themselves single-handed against the\r\nincursions of the Germans, the Cimbri,[1481] and the Teutons. The\r\nbravest of the Belgæ are the Bellovaci,[1482] and after them the\r\nSuessiones. The amount of their population may be estimated by the fact\r\nthat formerly there were said to be 300,000 Belgæ capable of bearing\r\narms.[1483] The numbers of the Helvetii, the Arverni, and their allies,\r\nhave already been mentioned. All this is a proof both of the amount of\r\nthe population [of Gaul], and, as before remarked, of the fecundity of\r\ntheir women, and the ease with which they rear their children. The Gauls\r\nwear the sagum, let their hair grow, and wear short breeches. Instead of\r\ntunics they wear a slashed garment with sleeves descending a little\r\nbelow the hips.[1484] The wool [of their sheep] is coarse, but long;\r\nfrom it they weave the thick saga called laines. However, in the\r\nnorthern parts the Romans rear flocks of sheep which they cover with\r\nskins, and which produce very fine wool. The equipment [of the Gauls] is\r\nin keeping with the size of their bodies; they have a long sword hanging\r\nat their right side, a long shield, and lances in proportion, together\r\nwith a madaris somewhat resembling a javelin; some of them also use bows\r\nand slings; they have also a piece of wood resembling a pilum, which\r\nthey hurl not out of a thong, but from their hand, and to a farther\r\ndistance than an arrow. They principally make use of it in shooting\r\nbirds. To the present day most of them lie on the ground, and take their\r\nmeals seated on straw. They subsist principally on milk and all kinds of\r\nflesh, especially that of swine, which they eat both fresh and salted.\r\nTheir swine live in the fields, and surpass in height, strength, and\r\nswiftness. To persons unaccustomed to approach them they are almost as\r\ndangerous as wolves. The people dwell in great houses arched,\r\nconstructed of planks and wicker, and covered with a heavy thatched\r\nroof. They have sheep and swine in such abundance, that they supply saga\r\nand salted pork in plenty, not only to Rome but to most parts of Italy.\r\nTheir governments were for the most part aristocratic; formerly they\r\nchose a governor every year, and a military leader was likewise elected\r\nby the multitude.[1485] At the present day they are mostly under\r\n[CAS. 197] subjection to the Romans. They have a peculiar custom in their\r\nassemblies. If any one makes an uproar or interrupts the person\r\nspeaking, an attendant advances with a drawn sword, and commands him\r\nwith menace to be silent; if he persists, the attendant does the same\r\nthing a second and third time; and finally, [if he will not obey,] cuts\r\noff from his sagum so large a piece as to render the remainder useless.\r\nThe labours of the two sexes are distributed in a manner the reverse of\r\nwhat they are with us, but this is a common thing with numerous other\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\n4. Amongst [the Gauls] there are generally three divisions of men\r\nespecially reverenced, the Bards, the Vates, and the Druids. The Bards\r\ncomposed and chanted hymns; the Vates occupied themselves with the\r\nsacrifices and the study of nature; while the Druids joined to the study\r\nof nature that of moral philosophy. The belief in the justice [of the\r\nDruids] is so great that the decision both of public and private\r\ndisputes is referred to them; and they have before now, by their\r\ndecision, prevented armies from engaging when drawn up in battle-array\r\nagainst each other. All cases of murder are particularly referred to\r\nthem. When there is plenty of these they imagine there will likewise be\r\na plentiful harvest. Both these and the others[1486] assert that the\r\nsoul is indestructible, and likewise the world, but that sometimes fire\r\nand sometimes water have prevailed in making great changes.[1487]\r\n\r\n5. To their simplicity and vehemence, the Gauls join much folly,\r\narrogance, and love of ornament. They wear golden collars round their\r\nnecks, and bracelets on their arms and wrists, and those who are of any\r\ndignity have garments dyed and worked with gold. This lightness of\r\ncharacter makes them intolerable when they conquer, and throws them into\r\nconsternation when worsted. In addition to their folly, they have a\r\nbarbarous and absurd custom, common however with many nations of the\r\nnorth, of suspending the heads of their enemies from their horses’ necks\r\non their return from battle, and when they have arrived nailing them as\r\na spectacle to their gates. Posidonius says he witnessed this in many\r\ndifferent places, and was at first shocked, but became familiar with it\r\nin time on account of its frequency. The heads of any illustrious\r\npersons they embalm with cedar, exhibit them to strangers, and would not\r\nsell them for their weight in gold.[1488] However, the Romans put a stop\r\nto these customs, as well as to their modes of sacrifice and divination,\r\nwhich were quite opposite to those sanctioned by our laws. They would\r\nstrike a man devoted as an offering in his back with a sword, and divine\r\nfrom his convulsive throes. Without the Druids they never sacrifice. It\r\nis said they have other modes of sacrificing their human victims; that\r\nthey pierce some of them with arrows, and crucify others in their\r\ntemples; and that they prepare a colossus of hay and wood, into which\r\nthey put cattle, beasts of all kinds, and men, and then set fire to it.\r\n\r\n6. They say that in the ocean, not far from the coast, there is a small\r\nisland lying opposite to the outlet of the river Loire, inhabited by\r\nSamnite women who are Bacchantes, and conciliate and appease that god by\r\nmysteries and sacrifices. No man is permitted to land on the island; and\r\nwhen the women desire to have intercourse with the other sex, they cross\r\nthe sea, and afterwards return again. They have a custom of once a year\r\nunroofing the whole of the temple, and roofing it again the same day\r\nbefore sunset, each one bringing some of the materials. If any one lets\r\nher burden fall, she is torn in pieces by the others, and her limbs\r\ncarried round the temple with wild shouts, which they never cease until\r\ntheir rage is exhausted. [They say] it always happens that some one\r\ndrops her burden, and is thus sacrificed.\r\n\r\nBut what Artemidorus tells us concerning the crows, partakes still more\r\nof fiction. He narrates that on the coast, washed by the ocean, there is\r\na harbour named the Port of Two Crows, and that here two crows may be\r\nseen with their right wings white. Those who have any dispute come here,\r\nand each one having placed a plank for himself on a lofty eminence,\r\nsprinkles crumbs thereupon; the birds fly to these, eat up the one and\r\nscatter the other, and he whose crumbs are scattered gains the cause.\r\nThis narration has decidedly too much the air of fiction. What he\r\nnarrates concerning Ceres and Proserpine is more credible. He says that\r\nthere is an island near Britain in which they perform sacrifices to\r\n[CAS. 199] these goddesses after the same fashion that they do in\r\nSamothrace. The following is also credible, that a tree grows in Keltica\r\nsimilar to a fig, which produces a fruit resembling a Corinthian\r\ncapital, and which, being cut, exudes a poisonous juice which they use\r\nfor poisoning their arrows. It is well known that all the Kelts are fond\r\nof disputes; and that amongst them pæderasty is not considered shameful.\r\nEphorus extends the size of Keltica too far, including within it most of\r\nwhat we now designate as Iberia, as far as Gades. He states that the\r\npeople are great admirers of the Greeks, and relates many particulars\r\nconcerning them not applicable to their present state. This is one:—That\r\nthey take great care not to become fat or big-bellied, and that if any\r\nyoung man exceeds the measure of a certain girdle, he is punished.[1489]\r\n\r\nSuch is our account of Keltica beyond the Alps.[1490]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Britain is triangular in form; its longest side lies parallel to\r\nKeltica, in length neither exceeding nor falling short of it; for each\r\nof them extends as much as 4300 or 4400 stadia: the side of Keltica\r\nextending from the mouths of the Rhine to the northern extremities of\r\nthe Pyrenees towards Aquitaine; and that of Britain, which commences at\r\nKent, its most eastern point, opposite the mouths of the Rhine,\r\nextending to the western extremity of the island, which lies over\r\nagainst Aquitaine and the Pyrenees. This is the shortest line from the\r\nPyrenees to the Rhine; the longest is said to be 5000 stadia; but it is\r\nlikely that there is some convergency of the river towards the mountain\r\nfrom a strictly parallel position, there being an inclination of either\r\ntoward the other at the extremities next the ocean.\r\n\r\n2. There are four passages commonly used from the continent to the\r\nisland, namely, from the mouths of the rivers Rhine, Seine, Loire, and\r\nGaronne; but to such as set sail from the parts about the Rhine, the\r\npassage is not exactly from its mouths, but from the Morini,[1491] who\r\nborder on the Menapii,[1492] among whom also is situated Itium,[1493]\r\nwhich divus Cæsar used as his naval station when about to pass over to\r\nthe island: he set sail by night, and arrived the next day about the\r\nfourth hour,[1494] having completed a passage of 320 stadia, and he\r\nfound the corn in the fields. The greatest portion of the island is\r\nlevel and woody, although many tracts are hilly. It produces corn,\r\ncattle, gold, silver, and iron, which things are brought thence, and\r\nalso skins, and slaves, and dogs sagacious in hunting; the Kelts use\r\nthese, as well as their native dogs, for the purposes of war. The men\r\nare taller than the Kelts, with hair less yellow; they are slighter in\r\ntheir persons. As an instance of their height, we ourselves saw at Rome\r\nsome youths who were taller than the tallest there by as much as half a\r\nfoot, but their legs were bowed, and in other respects they were not\r\nsymmetrical in conformation. Their manners are in part like those of the\r\nKelts, though in part more simple and barbarous; insomuch that some of\r\nthem, though possessing plenty of milk, have not skill enough to make\r\ncheese, and are totally unacquainted with horticulture and other matters\r\nof husbandry. There are several states amongst them. In their wars they\r\nmake use of chariots for the most part, as do some of the Kelts. Forests\r\nare their cities; for having enclosed an ample space [CAS. 200] with\r\nfelled trees, they make themselves huts therein, and lodge their cattle,\r\nthough not for any long continuance. Their atmosphere is more subject to\r\nrain than to snow; even in their clear days the mist continues for a\r\nconsiderable time, insomuch that throughout the whole day the sun is\r\nonly visible for three or four hours about noon; and this must be the\r\ncase also amongst the Morini, and the Menapii, and among all the\r\nneighbouring people.\r\n\r\n3. Divus Cæsar twice passed over to the island, but quickly returned,\r\nhaving effected nothing of consequence, nor proceeded far into the\r\ncountry, as well on account of some commotions in Keltica, both among\r\nhis own soldiers and among the barbarians, as because of the loss of\r\nmany of his ships at the time of the full moon, when both the ebb and\r\nflow of the tides were greatly increased.[1495] Nevertheless he gained\r\ntwo or three victories over the Britons, although he had transported\r\nthither only two legions of his army, and brought away hostages and\r\nslaves and much other booty. At the present time, however, some of the\r\nprinces there have, by their embassies and solicitations, obtained the\r\nfriendship of Augustus Cæsar, dedicated their offerings in the Capitol,\r\nand brought the whole island into intimate union with the Romans. They\r\npay but moderate duties both on the imports and exports from Keltica;\r\nwhich are ivory bracelets and necklaces, amber, vessels of glass, and\r\nsmall wares; so that the island scarcely needs a garrison, for at the\r\nleast it would require one legion and some cavalry to enforce tribute\r\nfrom them; and the total expenditure for the army would be equal to the\r\nrevenue collected; for if a tribute were levied, of necessity the\r\nimposts must be diminished, and at the same time some danger would be\r\nincurred if force were to be employed.\r\n\r\n4. There are also other small islands around Britain; but one, of great\r\nextent, Ierna,[1496] lying parallel to it towards the north, long or\r\nrather, wide; concerning which we have nothing certain to relate,\r\nfurther than that its inhabitants are more savage than the Britons,\r\nfeeding on human flesh, and enormous eaters, and deeming it commendable\r\nto devour their deceased fathers,[1497] as well as openly[1498] to have\r\ncommerce not only with other women, but also with their own mothers and\r\nsisters.[1499] But this we relate perhaps without very competent\r\nauthority; although to eat human flesh is said to be a Scythian custom;\r\nand during the severities of a siege, even the Kelts, the Iberians, and\r\nmany others, are reported to have done the like.[1500]\r\n\r\n5. The account of Thule is still more uncertain, on account of its\r\nsecluded situation; for they consider it to be the northernmost of all\r\nlands of which the names are known. The falsity of what Pytheas has\r\nrelated concerning this and neighbouring places, is proved by what he\r\nhas asserted of well-known countries. For if, as we have shown, his\r\ndescription of these is in the main incorrect, what he says of far\r\ndistant countries is still more likely to be false.[1501] Nevertheless,\r\nas far as astronomy and the mathematics are concerned, he appears to\r\nhave reasoned correctly, that people bordering on the frozen [CAS. 201]\r\nzone would be destitute of cultivated fruits, and almost deprived of the\r\ndomestic animals; that their food would consist of millet, herbs,\r\nfruits, and roots; and that where there was corn and honey they would\r\nmake drink of these. That having no bright sun, they would thresh their\r\ncorn, and store it in vast granaries, threshing-floors being useless on\r\naccount of the rain and want of sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ALPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Having described Keltica beyond the Alps,[1502] and the nations who\r\ninhabit the country, we must now speak of the Alps themselves and their\r\ninhabitants, and afterwards of the whole of Italy; observing in our\r\ndescription such arrangement as the nature of the country shall point\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Alps do not commence at Monœci Portus,[1503] as some have asserted,\r\nbut from the region whence the Apennines take their rise about Genoa, a\r\nmercantile city of the Ligurians, and at the marshes named Sabatorum\r\nVada;[1504] for the Apennines take their rise near Genoa, and the Alps\r\nnear Sabatorum Vada. The distance between Genoa and the Sabatorum Vada\r\nis about 260 stadia. About 370 stadia farther on is the little city of\r\nAlbingaunum,[1505] inhabited by Ligurians who are called Ingauni. From\r\nthence to the Monœci Portus is 480 stadia. In the interval between is\r\nthe very considerable city of Albium Intemelium,[1506] inhabited by the\r\nIntemelii. These names are sufficient to prove that the Alps commence at\r\nthe Sabatorum Vada. For the Alps were formerly called Albia and\r\nAlpionia,[1507] and at the present day the high mountain in the country\r\nof the Iapodes,[1508] next to Ocra and the Alps, is named Albius,\r\nshowing that the Alps extend so far.\r\n\r\n2. Now since the Ligurians were divided into Ingauni and Intemelii, it was\r\nnatural that their maritime colonies should be distinguished, one by the\r\nname of Albium Intemelium, Alpine as it were, and the other by the more\r\nconcise form Albingaunum.[1509] To these two tribes of Ligurians already\r\nmentioned, Polybius adds those of the Oxybii and Deciates.[1510] The\r\nwhole coast from Monœci Portus to Tyrrhenia is continuous, and without\r\nharbours excepting some small roads and anchorages. Above it rise the\r\nrugged precipices of the Alpine range, leaving but a narrow passage\r\nalong the sea. This district, but particularly the mountains, is\r\ninhabited by Ligurians, principally subsisting on the produce of their\r\nherds, and milk, and a drink made of barley. There is plenty of wood\r\nhere for the construction of ships; the trees grow to a vast size, some\r\nof them having been found eight feet in diameter. Much of the wood is\r\nveined, and not inferior to cedar-wood for cabinet work. This wood,\r\ntogether with the produce of their cattle, hides, and honey, they\r\ntransport to the mart of Genoa, receiving in exchange for them the oil\r\nand wine of Italy; for the little [wine] which their country produces is\r\nharsh and tastes of pitch. Here are bred the horses and mules known as\r\nginni, and here too are wrought the Ligurian tunics and saga. In their\r\ncountry likewise there is plenty of lingurium, called by some\r\nelectrum.[1511] They use but few cavalry in war; their infantry are\r\ngood, and excellent slingers. Some have thought that their brazen\r\nshields prove these people to be of Grecian origin.\r\n\r\n3. The Monœci Portus is merely a roadstead, not capable of containing\r\neither many or large vessels. Here is a temple dedicated to Hercules\r\nMonœcus.[1512] The name seems to show it probable that the Massilian\r\nvoyages along the coast extended as far as here. Monœci Portus is\r\ndistant from Antipolis rather more than 200 stadia. The Salyes occupy\r\nthe region from thence to Marseilles, or a little farther; they\r\n[CAS.203] inhabit the Alps which lie above that city, and a portion of\r\nthe sea-coast, where they intermingle with the Greeks. The ancient\r\nGreeks gave to the Salyes the name of Ligyes,[1513] and to the country\r\nwhich was in the possession of the Marseillese, that of Ligystica.[1514]\r\nThe later Greeks named them Kelto-Ligyes,[1515] and assigned to them the\r\nwhole of the plains extending as far as Luerion[1516] and the Rhone.\r\nThey are divided into ten cantons, and are capable of raising troops not\r\nonly of infantry, but of cavalry also. These people were the first of\r\nthe Transalpine Kelts whom the Romans subdued after maintaining a\r\nlengthened war against them and the Ligurians. They closed [against the\r\nRomans] all the roads into Iberia along the sea-coast, and carried on a\r\nsystem of pillage both by sea and land. Their strength so increased that\r\nlarge armies were scarcely able to force a passage. And after a war of\r\neighty years, the Romans were hardly able to obtain a breadth of twelve\r\nstadia for the purpose of making a public road. After this, however, the\r\nRomans subdued the whole of them, and established among them a regular\r\nform of government, and imposed a tribute.[1517]\r\n\r\n4. After the Salyes, the Albienses, the Albiœci,[1518] and the Vocontii\r\ninhabit the northern portion of the mountains. The Vocontii extend as\r\nfar as the Allobriges, and occupy vast valleys in the depths of the\r\nmountains, not inferior to those inhabited by the Allobriges. Both the\r\nAllobriges and Ligurians are subject to the pretors sent into the\r\nNarbonnaise, but the Vocontii are governed by their own laws, as we have\r\nsaid of the Volcæ of Nemausus.[1519] Of the Ligurians between the Var\r\nand Genoa, those along the sea are considered Italians; while the\r\nmountaineers are governed by a prefect of the equestrian order, as is\r\nthe case in regard to other nations wholly barbarous.\r\n\r\n5. After the Vocontii, are the Iconii, the Tricorii, and the Medulli;\r\nwho inhabit the loftiest ridges of the mountains, for they say that some\r\nof them have an almost perpendicular ascent of 100 stadia, and a similar\r\ndescent to the frontiers of Italy. In these highlands there is a great\r\nlake; there are also two springs not far distant from each other; one of\r\nthese gives rise to the Durance, which flows like a torrent into the\r\nRhone, and to the Durias,[1520] which flows in an opposite direction;\r\nfor it mingles with the Po after having pursued its course through the\r\ncountry of the Salassi[1521] into Cisalpine Keltica. From the other\r\nsource, but much lower down, rises the Po itself, large and rapid, which\r\nas it advances becomes still vaster, and at the same time more gentle.\r\nAs it reaches the plains it increases in breadth, being augmented by\r\nnumerous [other rivers], and thus it becomes less impetuous in its\r\ncourse, and its current is weakened. Having become the largest river in\r\nEurope, with the exception of the Danube,[1522] it discharges itself\r\ninto the Adriatic Sea. The Medulli are situated considerably above the\r\nconfluence of the Isère and the Rhone.\r\n\r\n6. On the opposite side of the mountains, sloping towards Italy, dwell\r\nthe Taurini,[1523] a Ligurian nation, together with certain other\r\nLigurians. What is called the land of Ideonnus[1524] and Cottius belongs\r\nto these Ligurians. Beyond them and the Po are the Salassi; above whom\r\nin the summits [of the Alps] are the Kentrones, the Catoriges, the\r\nVeragri, the Nantuatæ,[1525] Lake Leman,[1526] traversed by the Rhone,\r\nand the [CAS. 204] sources of that river. Not far from these are the\r\nsources of the Rhine, and Mount Adulas,[1527] from whence the Rhine\r\nflows towards the north; likewise the Adda,[1528] which flows in an\r\nopposite direction, and discharges itself into Lake Larius,[1529] near\r\nto Como. Lying above Como, which is situated at the roots of the Alps,\r\non one side are the Rhæti and Vennones towards the east,[1530] and on\r\nthe other the Lepontii, the Tridentini, the Stoni,[1531] and numerous\r\nother small nations, poor and addicted to robbery, who in former times\r\npossessed Italy. At the present time some of them have been destroyed,\r\nand the others at length civilized, so that the passes over the\r\nmountains through their territories, which were formerly few and\r\ndifficult, now run in every direction, secure from any danger of these\r\npeople, and as accessible as art can make them. For Augustus Cæsar not\r\nonly destroyed the robbers, but improved the character of the roads as\r\nfar as practicable, although he could not every where overcome nature,\r\non account of the rocks and immense precipices; some of which tower\r\nabove the road, while others yawn beneath; so that departing ever so\r\nlittle [from the path], the traveller is in inevitable danger of falling\r\ndown bottomless chasms. In some places the road is so narrow as to make\r\nboth the foot traveller and his beasts of burden, who are unaccustomed\r\nto it, dizzy; but the animals of the district will carry their burdens\r\nquite securely. These things however are beyond remedy, as well as the\r\nviolent descent of vast masses of congealed snow from above, capable of\r\noverwhelming a whole company at a time, and sweeping them into the\r\nchasms beneath. Numerous masses lie one upon the other, one hill of\r\ncongealed snow being formed upon another, so that the uppermost mass is\r\neasily detached at any time from that below it, before being perfectly\r\nmelted by the sun.\r\n\r\n7. A great part of the country of the Salassi lies in a deep\r\nvalley,[1532] formed by a chain of mountains which encloses the district\r\non either side; a part of them however inhabit the overhanging ridges.\r\nThe route of those who are desirous of passing from Italy over these\r\nmountains, lies through the aforesaid valley. Beyond this the road\r\nseparates into two. The one which passes through the mountain peaks,\r\nknown as the Pennine Alps, cannot be traversed by carriages; the other,\r\nwhich runs through the country of the Centrones, lies more to the\r\nwest.[1533] The country of the Salassi contains gold mines, of which\r\nformerly, in the days of their power, they were masters, as well as of\r\nthe passes. The river Doria Baltea[1534] afforded them great facility in\r\nobtaining the metal by [supplying them with water] for washing the gold,\r\nand they have emptied the main bed by the numerous trenches cut for\r\ndrawing the water to different places. This operation, though\r\nadvantageous in gold hunting, was injurious to the agriculturists below,\r\nas it deprived them of the irrigation of a river, which, by the height\r\nof its position, was capable of watering their plains. This gave rise to\r\nfrequent wars between the two nations; when the Romans gained the\r\ndominion, the Salassi lost both their gold works and their country, but\r\nas they still possessed the mountains, they continued to sell water to\r\nthe public contractors of the gold mines; with whom there were continual\r\ndisputes on account of the avarice of the contractors, and thus the\r\nRoman generals sent into the country were ever able to find a pretext\r\nfor commencing war. And, until very recently, the Salassi at one time\r\nwaging war against the Romans, and at another making peace, took\r\noccasion to inflict numerous damages upon those who crossed over their\r\nmountains, by their system of plundering; and even exacted from Decimus\r\nBrutus, on his flight from Mutina,[1535] a drachm per man. Messala,\r\nlikewise, having taken up his winter quarters in their vicinity, was\r\nobliged to pay them, both for his fire-wood, and for the elm-wood for\r\nmaking javelins for the exercise of his troops. In one instance they\r\nplundered the treasures of Cæsar,[1536] and rolled down huge [CAS. 206]\r\nmasses of rock upon the soldiers under pretence of making roads, or\r\nbuilding bridges over the rivers. Afterwards Augustus completely\r\noverthrew them, and carried them to Eporedia,[1537] a Roman colony which\r\nhad been planted as a bulwark against the Salassi, although the\r\ninhabitants were able to do but little against them until the nation was\r\ndestroyed; their numbers amounted to 36,000 persons, besides 8000 men\r\ncapable of bearing arms. Terentius Varro, the general who defeated them,\r\nsold them all by public auction, as enemies taken in war. Three thousand\r\nRomans sent out by Augustus founded the city of Augusta,[1538] on the\r\nspot where Varro had encamped, and now the whole surrounding country,\r\neven to the summits of the mountains, is at peace.\r\n\r\n8. Beyond, both the eastern parts of the mountains, and those likewise\r\ninclining to the south, are possessed by the Rhæti and Vindelici, who\r\nadjoin the Helvetii and Boii, and press upon their plains. The Rhæti\r\nextend as far as Italy above Verona and Como. The Rhætian wine, which is\r\nesteemed not inferior to the finest wines of Italy, is produced [from\r\nvines which grow] at the foot of the mountains. These people extend also\r\nas far as the districts through which the Rhine flows. The Lepontii and\r\nCamuni are of their nation. The Vindelici and Norici possess, for the\r\nmost part, the opposite side of the mountains together with the Breuni\r\nand Genauni, who form part of the Illyrians.[1539] All these people were\r\ncontinually making incursions both into the neighbouring parts of Italy,\r\nand into [the countries] of the Helvetii, the Sequani,[1540] the Boii,\r\nand the Germans.[1541] But the Licattii, the Clautinatii, and the\r\nVennones[1542] proved the boldest amongst the Vindelici; and the\r\nRucantii and Cotuantii amongst the Rhæti. Both the Estiones and\r\nBrigantii belong to the Vindelici; their cities are Brigantium,\r\nCampodunum, and Damasia, which may be looked upon as the Acropolis of\r\nthe Licattii. It is narrated, as an instance of the extreme brutality of\r\nthese robbers towards the people of Italy, that when they have taken any\r\nvillage or city, they not only put to death all the men capable of\r\nbearing arms, but likewise all the male children, and do not even stop\r\nhere, but murder every pregnant woman who, their diviners say, will\r\nbring forth a male infant.[1543]\r\n\r\n9. After these come certain of the Norici, and the Carni, who inhabit\r\nthe country about the Adriatic Gulf and Aquileia. The Taurisci belong to\r\nthe Norici. Tiberius and his brother Drusus in one summer put a stop to\r\ntheir lawless incursions, so that now for three and thirty years[1544]\r\nthey have lived quietly and paid their tribute regularly. Throughout the\r\nwhole region of the Alps there are hilly districts capable of excellent\r\ncultivation, and well situated valleys; but the greater part, especially\r\nthe summits of the mountains inhabited by the robbers, are barren and\r\nunfruitful, both on account of the frost and the ruggedness of the land.\r\nOn account of the want of food and other necessaries the mountaineers\r\nhave sometimes been obliged to spare the inhabitants of the plains, that\r\nthey might have some people to supply them; for these they have given\r\nthem in exchange, resin, pitch, torches, [CAS. 207] wax, cheese, and\r\nhoney, of which they have plenty. In the Mount Apennine[1545] which lies\r\nabove the Carni there is a lake which runs out into the Isar, which\r\nriver, after receiving another river, the Aude,[1546] discharges itself\r\ninto the Adriatic. From this lake there is also another river, the\r\nAtesinus, which flows into the Danube.[1547] The Danube itself rises in\r\nthe mountains which are split into many branches and numerous summits.\r\nFor from Liguria to here the summits of the Alps stretch along\r\ncontinuously, presenting the appearance of one mountain; but after this\r\nthey rise and fall in turns, forming numerous ridges and peaks. The\r\nfirst of these is beyond the Rhine and the lake[1548] inclining towards\r\nthe east, its ridge moderately elevated; here are the sources of the\r\nDanube near to the Suevi and the forest of Hercynia.[1549] The other\r\nbranches extend towards Illyria and the Adriatic, such are the Mount\r\nApennine, already mentioned, Tullum and Phligadia,[1550] the mountains\r\nlying above the Vindelici from whence proceed the Duras,[1551] the\r\nClanis,[1552] and many other rivers which discharge themselves like\r\ntorrents into the current of the Danube.\r\n\r\n10. Near to these regions dwell the Iapodes, (a nation now mixed with\r\nthe Illyrians, and Kelts,) close to them is [the Mount] Ocra.[1553]\r\nFormerly the Iapodes were numerous, inhabiting either side of the\r\nmountain, and were notorious for their predatory habits, but they have\r\nbeen entirely reduced and brought to subjection by Augustus Cæsar. Their\r\ncities are Metulum,[1554] Arupenum,[1555] Monetium,[1556] and\r\nVendon.[1557] After these is the city of Segesta,[1558] [situated] in a\r\nplain. Near to it flows the river Save,[1559] which discharges itself\r\ninto the Danube. This city lies in an advantageous position for carrying\r\non war against the Dacians.[1560] Ocra forms the lowest portion of the\r\nAlps, where they approach the territory of the Carni, and through which\r\nthey convey the merchandise of Aquileia in waggons to Pamportus.[1561]\r\nThis route is not more than 400 stadia. From thence they convey it by\r\nthe rivers as far as the Danube and surrounding districts, for a\r\nnavigable river[1562] which flows out of Illyria, passes by Pamportus,\r\nand discharges itself into the Save, so that the merchandise may easily\r\nbe carried down both to Segesta, and to the Pannonians, and\r\nTaurisci.[1563] It is near this city,[1564] that the Kulp[1565] falls\r\ninto the Save. Both of these rivers are navigable, and flow down from\r\nthe Alps. The Alps contain wild horses and cattle, and Polybius asserts\r\nthat an animal of a singular form is found there; it resembles a stag\r\nexcept in the neck and hair, which are similar to those of a wild boar;\r\nunder its chin it has a tuft of hair about a span long, and the\r\nthickness of the tail of a young horse.[1566]\r\n\r\n11. One of the passages over the mountains from Italy into Transalpine\r\nand northern Keltica is that which passes through the country of the\r\nSalassi, and leads to Lugdunum.[1567] This [route] is divided into two\r\nways, one practicable for carriages, but longer, which crosses the\r\ncountry of the Centrones, the other steep and narrow, but shorter; this\r\ncrosses the Pennine [Alps]. Lugdunum is situated in the midst of the\r\ncountry, serving as an Acropolis, both on account of the confluence of\r\n[CAS. 208] the rivers, and of its being equally near to all parts. It\r\nwas on this account that Agrippa cut all the roads from this [as a\r\ncentre] one running through the mountains of the Cevennes to the\r\nSantones[1568] and Aquitaine,[1569] another towards the Rhine; a third\r\ntowards the ocean by the country of the Bellovaci[1570] and\r\nAmbiani,[1571] and a fourth towards the Narbonnaise and the coast of\r\nMarseilles.[1572] The traveller, also, leaving Lugdunum and the country\r\nabove on his left, may pass over the Pennine Alps themselves, the Rhone,\r\nor Lake Leman, into the plains of the Helvetii, whence there is a\r\npassage through Mount Jura into the country of the Sequani, and\r\nLingones; here the road separates into two routes, one running to the\r\nRhine, and the other[1573] to the ocean.\r\n\r\n12. Polybius tells us that in his time the gold mines were so rich about\r\nAquileia, but particularly in the countries of the Taurisci Norici, that\r\nif you dug but two feet below the surface you found gold, and that the\r\ndiggings [generally] were not deeper than fifteen feet. In some\r\ninstances the gold was found pure in lumps about the size of a bean or\r\nlupin, and which diminished in the fire only about one eighth; and in\r\nothers, though requiring more fusion, was still very profitable. Certain\r\nItalians[1574] aiding the barbarians in working [the mines], in the\r\nspace of two months the value of gold was diminished throughout the\r\nwhole of Italy by one third. The Taurisci on discovering this drove out\r\ntheir fellow-labourers, and only sold the gold themselves. Now, however,\r\nthe Romans possess all the gold mines. Here, too, as well as in Iberia,\r\nthe rivers yield gold-dust as well as the diggings, though not in such\r\nlarge quantities. The same writer, speaking of the extent and height of\r\nthe Alps, compares with them the largest mountains of Greece, such as\r\nTaygetum,[1575] Lycæum,[1576] Parnassus,[1577] Olympus,[1578]\r\nPelion,[1579] Ossa,[1580] and of Thrace, as the Hæmus, Rhodope, and\r\nDunax, saying that an active person might almost ascend any of these in\r\na single day, and go round them in the same time, whereas five days\r\nwould not be sufficient to ascend the Alps, while their length along the\r\nplains extends 2200 stadia.[1581] He only names four passes over the\r\nmountains, one through Liguria close to the Tyrrhenian Sea,[1582] a\r\nsecond through the country of the Taurini,[1583] by which Hannibal\r\npassed, a third through the country of the Salassi,[1584] and a fourth\r\nthrough that of the Rhæti,[1585] all of them precipitous. In these\r\nmountains, he says, there are numerous lakes; three large ones, the\r\nfirst of which is Benacus,[1586] 500 stadia in length and 130 in\r\nbreadth, the river Mincio flows from it. The second is the\r\nVerbanus,[1587] 400 stadia [in length], and in breadth smaller than the\r\npreceding; [CAS. 209] the great river Ticino[1588] flows from this\r\n[lake]. The third is the Larius,[1589] its length is nearly 300 stadia,\r\nand its breadth 30, the river Adda flows from it. All these rivers flow\r\ninto the Po. This is what we have to say concerning the Alpine\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Fifth Book contains a description of Italy from the roots of\r\n   the Alps to the Strait of Sicily, the Gulf of Taranto, and the\r\n   region about Posidonium; likewise of Venetia, Liguria, Agro\r\n   Piceno, Tuscany, Rome, Campania, Lucania, Apulia, and the islands\r\n   lying in the sea between Genoa and Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. At the foot of the Alps commences the region now known as Italy. The\r\nancients by Italy merely understood Œnotria, which reached from the\r\nStrait of Sicily to the Gulf of Taranto, and the region about\r\nPosidonium,[1590] but the name has extended even to the foot of the\r\nAlps; comprehending on one side that portion of Liguria situated by the\r\nsea, from the confines of Tyrrhenia to the Var; and on the other, that\r\nportion of Istria which extends as far as Pola. It seems probable that\r\nthe first inhabitants were named Italians, and, being successful, they\r\ncommunicated their name to the neighbouring tribes, and this propagation\r\n[of name] continued until the Romans obtained dominion. Afterwards, when\r\nthe Romans conferred on the Italians the privileges of equal\r\ncitizenship, and thought fit to extend the same honour to the Cisalpine\r\nGalatæ and Heneti,[1591] they comprised the whole under the general\r\ndenomination of Italians and Romans; they likewise founded amongst them\r\nnumerous colonies, some earlier, some later, of which it would be\r\ndifficult to say which are the most considerable.\r\n\r\n2. It is not easy to describe the whole of Italy under any one\r\ngeometrical figure; although some say that it is a promontory of\r\ntriangular form, extending towards the south and winter rising, with its\r\napex towards the Strait of Sicily, and [CAS. 210] its base formed by the\r\nAlps.... [No one can allow this definition either for the base or one of\r\nthe sides,] although it is correct for the other side which terminates\r\nat the Strait, and is washed by the Tyrrhenian Sea. But a triangle,\r\nproperly so called, is a rectilinear figure, whereas in this instance\r\nboth the base and the sides are curved. So that, if I agree, I must add\r\nthat the base and the sides are of a curved figure, and it must be\r\nconceded to me that the eastern side deviates, as well; otherwise they\r\nhave not been sufficiently exact in describing as one side that which\r\nextends from the head of the Adriatic to the Strait [of Sicily]. For we\r\ndesignate as a side a line without any angle; now a line without any\r\nangle is one which does not incline to either side, or but very little;\r\nwhereas the line from Ariminum[1592] to the Iapygian promontory,[1593]\r\nand that from the Strait [of Sicily] to the same promontory, incline\r\nvery considerably. The same I consider to be the case with regard to the\r\nlines drawn from the head of the Adriatic and Iapygia, for meeting about\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ariminum and Ravenna, they form an angle, or if not\r\nan angle, at least a strongly defined curve. Consequently, if the coast\r\nfrom the head [of the Adriatic] to Iapygia be considered as one side, it\r\ncannot be described as a right line; neither can the remainder of the\r\nline from hence to the Strait [of Sicily], though it may be considered\r\nanother side, be said to form a right line. Thus the figure [of Italy]\r\nmay be said to be rather quadrilateral than trilateral, and can never\r\nwithout impropriety be called a triangle. It is better to confess that\r\nyou cannot define exactly ungeometrical figures.\r\n\r\n3. [Italy], however, may be described in the following manner. The roots\r\nof the Alps are curved, and in the form of a gulf, the head turned\r\ntowards Italy; the middle of the gulf in the country of the Salassi, and\r\nits extremities turned, the one towards Ocra and the head of the\r\nAdriatic, the other towards the coast of Liguria as far as Genoa, a\r\nmercantile city of the Ligurians, where the Apennines fall in with the\r\nAlps. Immediately under [the Alps] there is a considerable plain, of\r\nabout an equal extent of 2100 stadia both in breadth and length; its\r\nsouthern side is closed by the coast of the Heneti[1594] and the\r\nApennines, which extend to Ariminum and Ancona; for these mountains,\r\ncommencing at Liguria, enter Tyrrhenia, leaving but a narrow sea-coast;\r\nthey afterwards retire by degrees into the interior, and having reached\r\nthe territory of Pisa, turn towards the east in the direction of the\r\nAdriatic as far as the country about Ariminum and Ancona, where they\r\napproach the sea-coast of the Heneti at right angles. Cisalpine Keltica\r\nis enclosed within these limits, and the length of the coast joined to\r\nthat of the mountains is 6300 stadia; its breadth rather less than 2000.\r\nThe remainder of Italy is long and narrow, and terminates in two\r\npromontories, one[1595] extending to the Strait of Sicily, the\r\nother[1596] to Iapygia. It is embraced on one side by the\r\nAdriatic,[1597] on the other by the Tyrrhenian Sea.[1598] The form and\r\nsize of the Adriatic resembles that portion of Italy bounded by the\r\nApennines and the two seas, and extending as far as Iapygia and the\r\nisthmus which separates the Gulf of Taranto from that of\r\nPosidonium.[1599] The greatest breadth of both is about 1300 stadia, and\r\nthe length not much less than 6000. The remainder of the country is\r\npossessed by the Bruttii, and certain of the Leucani. Polybius tells us,\r\nthat traversing the sea-coast on foot from Iapygia[1600] to the Strait\r\n[of Sicily] there are 3000 stadia, the coast being washed by the Sea of\r\nSicily; but, that going by water it is 500 stadia less. The Apennines,\r\nafter approaching the country about Ariminum and Ancona, and determining\r\nthe breadth of Italy at this point from sea to sea, change their\r\ndirection and divide the whole country throughout its length. As far as\r\nthe Peucetii and Leucani they do not recede much from the Adriatic, but\r\non arriving at the Leucani they decline considerably towards the other\r\nsea,[1601] and traversing the remainder of the distance through the\r\nLeucani and Bruttii, terminate at Leucopetra,[1602] in Reggio. Such is a\r\ngeneral description of the whole of present Italy. We will now endeavour\r\nto undertake a description of its various parts. And, first, of those\r\nsituated below the Alps.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 212] 4. This is a superb plain variegated with fruitful hills. The\r\nPo divides it almost through its midst, one side being denominated\r\nCispadana, and the other Transpadana. Cispadana comprehends that part\r\nnext the Apennines and Liguria and Transpadana the remainder. The former\r\n[division] is inhabited by Ligurian and Keltic nations, the former\r\ninhabiting the mountains and the latter the plains; and the latter\r\n[division] by Kelts and Heneti. These Kelts are of the same race as the\r\nTransalpine Kelts. Concerning the Heneti there are two traditions, some\r\nsaying that they are a colony of those Kelts of the same name who dwell\r\nby the ocean.[1603] Others say that they are descended from the Veneti\r\nof Paphlagonia, who took refuge here with Antenor after the Trojan war;\r\nand they give as a proof of this the attention these people bestow on\r\nrearing horses; which, though now entirely abandoned, was formerly in\r\ngreat esteem among them, resulting from the ancient rage for breeding\r\nmules, which Homer thus mentions:\r\n\r\n   “From the Eneti for forest mules renowned.”[1604]\r\n\r\nIt was here that Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, kept his stud of\r\nrace-horses. And, in consequence, the Henetian horses were much esteemed\r\nin Greece, and their breed in great repute for a long period.\r\n\r\n5. The whole of this country[1605] is full of rivers and marshes,\r\nespecially the district of the Heneti, which likewise experiences the\r\ntides of the sea. This is almost the only part of our sea[1606] which is\r\ninfluenced in the same manner as the ocean, and, like it, has ebb and\r\nflood tides. In consequence most of the plain is covered with\r\nlagoons.[1607] The inhabitants have dug canals and dikes, after the\r\nmanner of Lower Egypt, so that part of the country is drained and\r\ncultivated, and the rest is navigable. Some of their cities stand in the\r\nmidst of water like islands, others are only partially surrounded. Such\r\nas lie above the marshes in the interior are situated on rivers\r\nnavigable for a surprising distance, the Po in particular, which is\r\nboth a large river, and also continually swelled by the rains and snows.\r\nAs it expands into numerous outlets, its mouth is not easily perceptible\r\nand is difficult to enter. But experience surmounts even the greatest\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n6. Formerly, as we have said, the district next this river was chiefly\r\ninhabited by Kelts. The principal nations of these Kelts were the Boii,\r\nthe Insubri, and the Senones and Gæsatæ, who in one of their incursions\r\ntook possession of Rome. The Romans afterwards entirely extirpated these\r\nlatter, and expelled the Boii from their country, who then migrated to\r\nthe land about the Danube, where they dwelt with the Taurisci, and\r\nwarred against the Dacians until the whole nation was destroyed; and\r\nthey left to the surrounding tribes this sheep-pasturing district of\r\nIllyria. The Insubri still exist; their metropolis is Mediolanum,[1608]\r\nwhich formerly was a village, (for they all dwelt in villages,) but is\r\nnow a considerable city, beyond the Po, and almost touching the Alps.\r\nNear to it is Verona, a large city, and the smaller towns Brescia,\r\nMantua, Reggio, and Como. This latter was but a very indifferent colony,\r\nhaving been seriously impaired by the Rhæti who dwelt higher up, but it\r\nwas repeopled by Pompey Strabo, father of Pompey the Great. Afterwards\r\nCaius Scipio[1609] transferred thither 3000 men, and finally divus Cæsar\r\npeopled it with 5000 men, the most distinguished of whom were 500\r\nGreeks. He conferred on these the privileges of citizens, and enrolled\r\nthem amongst the inhabitants. They not only took up their abode here,\r\nbut left their name to the colony itself; for all the inhabitants taking\r\nthe name of Νεοκωμῖται, this was translated [into Latin], and the place\r\ncalled Novum-Comum. Near to this place is Lake Larius,[1610] which is\r\nfilled by the river Adda, and afterwards flows out into the Po. The\r\nsources of this river, as well as those of the Rhine, rise in Mount\r\nAdulas.[1611]\r\n\r\n7. These cities are situated high above the marshes; near to them is\r\nPatavium,[1612] the finest of all the cities in this [CAS. 213]\r\ndistrict, and which at the time of the late census[1613] was said to\r\ncontain 500 equites. Anciently it could muster an army of 120,000 men.\r\nThe population and skill of this city is evinced by the vast amount of\r\nmanufactured goods it sends to the Roman market, especially clothing of\r\nall kinds. It communicates with the sea by a river navigable from a\r\nlarge harbour [at its mouth], the river runs across the marshes for a\r\ndistance of 250 stadia. This harbour,[1614] as well as the river,[1615]\r\nis named Medoacus. Situated in the marshes is the great [city of]\r\nRavenna, built entirely on piles,[1616] and traversed by canals, which\r\nyou cross by bridges or ferry-boats. At the full tides it is washed by a\r\nconsiderable quantity of sea-water, as well as by the river, and thus\r\nthe sewage is carried off, and the air purified; in fact, the district\r\nis considered so salubrious that the [Roman] governors have selected it\r\nas a spot to bring up and exercise the gladiators in. It is a remarkable\r\npeculiarity of this place, that, though situated in the midst of a\r\nmarsh, the air is perfectly innocuous; the same is the case with respect\r\nto Alexandria in Egypt, where the malignity of the lake during summer is\r\nentirely removed by the rising of the river which covers over the mud.\r\nAnother remarkable peculiarity is that of its vines, which, though\r\ngrowing in the marshes, make very quickly and yield a large amount of\r\nfruit, but perish in four or five years. Altinum[1617] stands likewise\r\nin the marshes, its situation being very similar to that of Ravenna.\r\nBetween them is Butrium,[1618] a small city of Ravenna, and Spina,[1619]\r\nwhich is now a village, but was anciently a celebrated Grecian city. In\r\nfact, the treasures of the Spinitæ are shown at Delphi, and it is,\r\nbesides, reported in history that they had dominion over the sea. They\r\nsay that it formerly stood on the sea; now, however, the district is\r\ninland about 90 stadia from the sea. Ravenna is reported to have been\r\nfounded by Thessalians, who not being able to sustain the violence of\r\nthe Tyrrheni, welcomed into their city some of the Ombrici, who still\r\npossess it, while they themselves returned home. These cities for the\r\nmost part are surrounded, and, as it were, washed by the marshes.\r\n\r\n8. Opitergium,[1620] Concordia, Atria,[1621] Vicetia,[1622] as well as\r\nsome smaller cities, are less annoyed by the marshes: they communicate\r\nby small navigable canals with the sea. They say that Atria was formerly\r\na famous city, from which the Adriatic Gulf, with a slight variation,\r\nreceived its name. Aquileia, which is the nearest to the head [of the\r\ngulf], was founded by the Romans,[1623] to keep in check the barbarians\r\ndwelling higher up. You may navigate transport ships to it up the river\r\nNatisone for more than sixty stadia. This is the trading city with the\r\nnations of Illyrians who dwell round the Danube. Some deal in marine\r\nmerchandise, and carry in waggons wine in wooden casks and oil, and\r\nothers exchange slaves, cattle, and hides. Aquileia is without the\r\nlimits of the Heneti, their country being bounded by a river which flows\r\nfrom the mountains of the Alps, and is navigable for a distance of 1200\r\nstadia, as far as the city of Noreia,[1624] near to where Cnæus Carbo\r\nwas defeated in his attack upon the Kimbrians.[1625] This place contains\r\nfine stations for gold washing and iron-works. At the very head of the\r\nAdriatic is the Timavum,[1626] a temple consecrated to Diomede, worthy\r\nof notice. For it contains a harbour and a fine grove, with seven\r\nsprings of fresh water, which fall into the sea in a broad, deep\r\nriver.[1627] Polybius, however, says that, with the exception of one,\r\nthey are all salt springs, and that it is on this account the place is\r\ncalled by the inhabitants—_the source and mother of the sea_.\r\nPosidonius, on the other hand, tells us that the river Timavo, after\r\nflowing from the mountains, precipitates itself into a chasm, [CAS. 215]\r\nand after flowing under ground about 130 stadia, discharges itself into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n9. That Diomedes did hold sovereignty over the country around this\r\nsea,[1628] is proved both by the Diomedean islands,[1629] and the\r\ntraditions concerning the Daunii and Argos-Hippium.[1630] Of these we\r\nshall narrate as much as may be serviceable to history, and shall leave\r\nalone the numerous falsehoods and myths; such, for instance, as those\r\nconcerning Phaethon and the Heliades[1631] changed into alders near the\r\n[river] Eridanus, which exists no where, although said to be near the\r\nPo;[1632] of the islands Electrides, opposite the mouths of the Po, and\r\nthe Meleagrides,[1633] found in them; none of which things exist in\r\nthese localities.[1634] However, some have narrated that honours are\r\npaid to Diomedes amongst the Heneti, and that they sacrifice to him a\r\nwhite horse; two groves are likewise pointed out, one [sacred] to the\r\nArgian Juno, and the other to the Ætolian Diana. They have too, as we\r\nmight expect, fictions concerning these groves; for instance, that the\r\nwild beasts in them grow tame, that the deer herd with wolves, and they\r\nsuffer men to approach and stroke them; and that when pursued by dogs,\r\nas soon as they have reached these groves, the dogs no longer pursue\r\nthem. They say, too, that a certain person, well known for the facility\r\nwith which he offered himself as a pledge for others, being bantered on\r\nthis subject by some hunters who came up with him having a wolf in\r\nleash, they said in jest, that if he would become pledge for the wolf\r\nand pay for the damage he might do, they would loose the bonds. To this\r\nthe man consented, and they let loose the wolf, who gave chase to a herd\r\nof horses unbranded, and drove them into the stable of the person who\r\nhad become pledge for him. The man accepted the gift, branded the horses\r\nwith [the representation of] a wolf, and named them _Lucophori_. They\r\nwere distinguished rather for their swiftness than gracefulness. His\r\nheirs kept the same brand and the same name for this race of horses, and\r\nmade it a rule never to part with a single mare, in order that they\r\nmight remain sole possessors of the race which became famous. At the\r\npresent day, however, as we have before remarked, this [rage for]\r\nhorse-breeding has entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nAfter the Timavum[1635] comes the sea-coast of Istria as far as Pola,\r\nwhich appertains to Italy. Between [the two] is the fortress of\r\nTergeste, distant from Aquileia 180 stadia. Pola is situated in a gulf\r\nforming a kind of port, and containing some small islands,[1636]\r\nfruitful, and with good harbours. This city was anciently founded by the\r\nColchians sent after Medea, who not being able to fulfil their mission,\r\ncondemned themselves to exile. As Callimachus says,\r\n\r\n             “It a Greek would call\r\n   The town of Fugitives, but in their tongue\r\n   ’Tis Pola named.”\r\n\r\nThe different parts of Transpadana are inhabited by the Heneti and the\r\nIstrii as far as Pola; above the Heneti, by the Carni, the Cenomani, the\r\nMedoaci, and the Symbri.[1637] These nations were formerly at enmity\r\nwith the Romans, but the Cenomani and Heneti allied themselves with that\r\nnation, both prior to the expedition of Hannibal, when they waged war\r\nwith the Boii and Symbrii,[1637] and also after that time.\r\n\r\n10. Cispadana comprehends all that country enclosed [CAS. 216] between\r\nthe Apennines and the Alps as far as Genoa and Vada-Sabatorum.[1638] The\r\ngreater part was inhabited by the Boii, the Ligurians, the Senones, and\r\nGæsatæ; but after the depopulation of the Boii, and the destruction of\r\nthe Gæsatæ and Senones, the Ligurian tribes and the Roman colonies alone\r\nremained. The nation of the Ombrici[1639] and certain of the Tyrrheni\r\nare also mixed amongst the Romans. These two nations, before the\r\naggrandizement of the Romans, had some disputes with each other\r\nconcerning precedence. Having only the river Tiber between, it was easy\r\nto commence war upon each other; and if the one sent out an expedition\r\nagainst any nation, it was the ambition of the other to enter the same\r\ncountry with an equal force. Thus, the Tyrrheni, having organized a\r\nsuccessful expedition against the barbarians [dwelling in the countries]\r\nabout the Po, but having speedily lost again through their luxury [all\r\nthey had acquired], the Ombrici made war upon those who had driven them\r\nout. Disputes arose between the Tyrrheni and Ombrici concerning the\r\nright of possessing these places, and both nations founded many\r\ncolonies; those, however, of the Ombrici were most numerous, as they\r\nwere nearest to the spot. When the Romans gained the dominion, they sent\r\nout colonies to different parts, but preserved those which had been\r\nformerly planted by their predecessors. And although now they are all\r\nRomans, they are not the less distinguished, some by the names of Ombri\r\nand Tyrrheni, others by those of Heneti, Ligurians, and Insubri.\r\n\r\n11. Both in Cispadana and around the Po there are some fine cities.\r\nPlacentia[1640] and Cremona, situated about the middle of the country,\r\nare close to each other. Between these and Ariminum,[1641] are Parma,\r\nMutina,[1642] and Bononia,[1643] which is near to Ravenna; amongst these\r\nare smaller cities on the route to Rome, as Acara,[1644]\r\nRhegium-Lepidum,[1645] Macri-Campi,[1646] where a public festival is\r\nheld every year, Claterna,[1647] Forum-Cornelium;[1648] while\r\nFaventia[1649] and Cæsena, situated near to the river Savio[1650] and\r\nthe Rubicon,[1651] are adjacent to Ariminum. Ariminum, like Ravenna, is\r\nan ancient colony of the Ombri, but both of them have received also\r\nRoman colonies. Ariminum has a port and a river[1652] of the same name\r\nas itself. From Placentia to Ariminum there are 1300 stadia. About 36\r\nmiles above Placentia, towards the boundaries of the kingdom of Cottius,\r\nis the city of Ticinum,[1653] by which flows a river[1654] bearing the\r\nsame name, which falls into the Po, while a little out of the route are\r\nClastidium,[1655] Derthon,[1656] and Aquæ-Statiellæ.[1657] But the\r\ndirect route as far as Ocelum,[1658] along the Po and the Doria\r\nRiparia,[1659] is full of precipices, intersected by numerous other\r\nrivers, one of which is the Durance,[1660] and is about 160 miles long.\r\nHere commence the Alpine mountains and Keltica.[1661] Near to the\r\nmountains above Luna is the city of Lucca. Some [of the people of this\r\npart of Italy] dwell in villages, nevertheless it is well populated, and\r\nfurnishes the greater part of the military force, and of equites, of\r\nwhom the senate is partly composed. Derthon is a considerable city,\r\nsituated about half way on the road from Genoa to Placentia, which are\r\ndistant 400 stadia from each other. Aquæ-Statiellæ is on the same route.\r\nThat from Placentia to Ariminum we have already described, but the sail\r\nto Ravenna down the Po requires two days and nights. A[1662] great part\r\nof Cispadana likewise was covered by marshes, through which Hannibal\r\npassed with difficulty on his march into Tyrrhenia.[1663] But Scaurus\r\ndrained the plains by navigable canals from the Po[1664] to the country\r\nof the Parmesans. For the Trebia meeting the Po near Placentia, and\r\nhaving previously received many other rivers, is over-swollen near this\r\nplace. I allude to the Scaurus[1665] who also made the Æmilian road\r\nthrough Pisa and Luna as far as Sabbatorum, and thence through Derthon.\r\nThere is another Æmilian road, which continues the Flaminian. For Marcus\r\nLepidus and Caius Flaminius being colleagues in the consulship, and\r\nhaving vanquished the Ligurians, the one made the Via Flaminia from Rome\r\nacross [CAS. 218] Tyrrhenia and Ombrica as far as the territory of\r\nAriminum,[1666] the other, the road as far as Bononia,[1667] and thence\r\nto Aquileia[1668] by the roots of the Alps, and encircling the marshes.\r\nThe boundaries which separate from the rest of Italy this country, which\r\nwe designate Citerior Keltica,[1669] were marked by the Apennine\r\nmountains above Tyrrhenia and the river Esino,[1670] and afterwards by\r\nthe Rubicon.[1671] Both these rivers fall into the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n12. The fertility of this country is proved by its population, the size\r\nof its cities, and its wealth, in all of which the Romans of this\r\ncountry surpass the rest of Italy. The cultivated land produces fruits\r\nin abundance and of every kind, and the woods contain such abundance of\r\nmast, that Rome is principally supplied from the swine fed there. Being\r\nwell supplied with water, millet grows there in perfection. This affords\r\nthe greatest security against famine, inasmuch as millet resists any\r\ninclemency of the atmosphere, and never fails, even when there is\r\nscarcity of other kinds of grain. Their pitch-works are amazing, and\r\ntheir casks give evidence of the abundance of wine: these are made of\r\nwood, and are larger than houses, and the great supply of pitch allows\r\nthem to be sold cheap. The soft wool and by far the best is produced in\r\nthe country round Mutina[1672] and the river Panaro;[1673] while the\r\ncoarse wool, which forms the main article of clothing amongst the slaves\r\nin Italy, is produced in Liguria and the country of the Symbri. There is\r\na middling kind grown about Patavium,[1674] of which the finer carpets,\r\ngausapi,[1675] and every thing else of the same sort, whether with the\r\nwool on one or on both sides, are made. The mines are not worked now so\r\ndiligently, because not equally profitable with those of Transalpine\r\nKeltica and Iberia; but formerly they must have been, since there were\r\ngold-diggings even in Vercelli, near to Ictimuli,[1676] both which\r\nvillages are near to Placentia.[1677] Here we finish our description of\r\nthe first part of Italy, and pass on to the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the second place, we shall treat of that portion of Liguria\r\nsituated in the Apennines, between the Keltica[1678] already described\r\nand Tyrrhenia. There is nothing worth mentioning about it, except that\r\nthe people dwell in villages, ploughing and digging the intractable\r\nland, or rather, as Posidonius expresses it, hewing the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe third division contains the Tyrrhenians, who dwell next the former,\r\nand inhabit the plains extending to the Tiber, which river, as far as\r\nits outlet, washes the side towards the east, the opposite side being\r\nwashed by the Tyrrhenian and Sardinian sea. The Tiber flows from the\r\nApennines, and is swelled by many rivers; it flows partly through\r\nTyrrhenia, dividing it in the first instance from Ombrica,[1679]\r\nafterwards from the Sabini and the Latini, who are situated next Rome as\r\nfar as the sea-coast; so that these countries are bounded in their\r\nbreadth by the river [Tiber] and the Tyrrhenians, and in their length by\r\neach other. They extend upwards towards the Apennines which approach the\r\nAdriatic. The first[1680] are the Ombrici, after these the Sabini, and\r\nfinally the inhabitants of Latium. They all commence from the river. The\r\ncountry of the Latini extends on one side along the sea-coast from Ostia\r\nto the city of Sinuessa, on the other it is bounded by the land of the\r\nSabini, (Ostia is the port of Rome, through which the Tiber passes in\r\nits course,) it [CAS. 219] extends in length as far as Campania and the\r\nSamnitic mountains. The country of the Sabini lies between the Latini\r\nand the Ombrici, it likewise extends to the Samnitic mountains, but\r\napproaches nearer to the Apennines inhabited by the Vestini, the\r\nPeligni, and the Marsi. The Ombrici lie between the country of the\r\nSabini and Tyrrhenia, but extend beyond the mountains as far as\r\nAriminum,[1681] and Ravenna. The Tyrrheni, commencing from their own sea\r\nand the Tiber, extend to the circular chain of mountains which stretches\r\nfrom Liguria to the Adriatic. We will now enter into a detailed account,\r\ncommencing with these.\r\n\r\n2. The Tyrrheni have now received from the Romans the surname of Etrusci\r\nand Tusci. The Greeks thus named them from Tyrrhenus the son of Atys, as\r\nthey say, who sent hither a colony from Lydia. Atys, who was one of the\r\ndescendants of Hercules and Omphale, and had two sons, in a time of\r\nfamine and scarcity determined by lot that Lydus should remain in the\r\ncountry, but that Tyrrhenus, with the greater part of the people, should\r\ndepart. Arriving here, he named the country after himself, Tyrrhenia,\r\nand founded twelve cities, having appointed as their governor Tarcon,\r\nfrom whom the city of Tarquinia [received its name], and who, on account\r\nof the sagacity which he had displayed from childhood, was feigned to\r\nhave been born with hoary hair. Placed originally under one authority,\r\nthey became flourishing; but it seems that in after-times, their\r\nconfederation being broken up and each city separated, they yielded to\r\nthe violence of the neighbouring tribes. Otherwise they would never have\r\nabandoned a fertile country for a life of piracy on the sea, roving from\r\none ocean to another; since, when united they were able not only to\r\nrepel those who assailed them, but to act on the offensive, and\r\nundertake long campaigns. After the foundation of Rome, Demaratus\r\narrived here, bringing with him people from Corinth.[1682] He was\r\nreceived at Tarquinia, where he had a son, named Lucumo, by a woman of\r\nthat country.[1683] Lucumo becoming the friend of Ancus Marcius, king\r\nof the Romans, succeeded him on the throne, and assumed the name of\r\nLucius Tarquinius Priscus. Both he and his father did much for the\r\nembellishment of Tyrrhenia, the one by means of the numerous artists who\r\nhad followed him from their native country; the other having the\r\nresources of Rome.[1684] It is said that the triumphal costume of the\r\nconsuls, as well as that of the other magistrates, was introduced from\r\nthe Tarquinii, with the fasces, axes, trumpets, sacrifices, divination,\r\nand music employed by the Romans in their public ceremonies. His son,\r\nthe second Tarquin, named Superbus, who was driven from his throne, was\r\nthe last king [of Rome]. Porsena, king of Clusium,[1685] a city of\r\nTyrrhenia, endeavoured to replace him on the throne by force of arms,\r\nbut not being able he made peace[1686] with the Romans, and departed in\r\na friendly way, with honour and loaded with gifts.\r\n\r\n3. Such are the facts concerning the celebrity of the Tyrrheni, to which\r\nmay be added the exploits of the Cæretani,[1687] who defeated the Galatæ\r\nafter they had taken Rome. Having attacked them as they were departing\r\nthrough the country of the Sabini, they took from them, much against\r\ntheir will, the ransom which the Romans had willingly paid to them;\r\nbesides this, they took under their protection those who fled to them\r\nout of Rome, the sacred fire and the priestesses of Vesta.[1688] The\r\nRomans, influenced by those who then misgoverned the city, seem not to\r\nhave been properly mindful of this service; for although they conferred\r\non them the rights of citizenship, they did not enrol them amongst the\r\ncitizens; and further, they inscribed upon the same roll with the\r\nCæretani, others who did not enjoy as great privileges as they did.\r\nHowever, [CAS. 220] amongst the Greeks this city was highly esteemed\r\nboth for its bravery and rectitude of conduct; for they refrained from\r\npiracy, with favourable opportunities for engaging in it, and dedicated\r\nat Delphi the treasure, as it was called, of the Agyllæi; for their\r\ncountry was formerly named Agylla, though now Cærea. It is said to have\r\nbeen founded by Pelasgi from Thessaly. The Lydians, who had taken the\r\nname of Tyrrheni, having engaged in war against the Agyllæi, one of\r\nthem, approaching the wall, inquired the name of the city; when one of\r\nthe Thessalians from the wall, instead of answering the question,\r\nsaluted him with χαῖρε.[1689] The Tyrrheni received this as an omen, and\r\nhaving taken the city they changed its name. This city, once so\r\nflourishing and celebrated, only preserves the traces [of its former\r\ngreatness]; the neighbouring hot springs, named Cæretana,[1690] being\r\nmore frequented than it, by the people attracted thither for the sake of\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\n4. Almost every one is agreed that the Pelasgi were an ancient race\r\nspread throughout the whole of Greece, but especially in the country of\r\nthe Æolians near to Thessaly. Ephorus, however, says that he considers\r\nthey were originally Arcadians, who had taken up a warlike mode of life;\r\nand having persuaded many others to the same course, imparted their own\r\nname to the whole, and became famous both among the Greeks, and in every\r\nother country where they chanced to come. Homer informs us that there\r\nwere colonies of them in Crete, for he makes Ulysses say to Penelope—\r\n\r\n   “Diverse their language is; Achaians some,\r\n   And some indigenous are; Cydonians there,\r\n   Crest-shaking Dorians, and Pelasgians dwell.”[1691]\r\n\r\nAnd that portion of Thessaly between the outlets of the Peneius[1692]\r\nand the Thermopylæ, as far as the mountains of Pindus, is named Pelasgic\r\nArgos, the district having formerly belonged to the Pelasgi. The poet\r\nhimself also gives to Dodonæan Jupiter, the epithet of Pelasgian:—\r\n\r\n   “Pelasgian, Dodonæan Jove supreme.”[1693]\r\n\r\nMany have likewise asserted that the nations of the Epirus are Pelasgic,\r\nbecause the dominions of the Pelasgi extended so far. And, as many of\r\nthe heroes have been named Pelasgi, later writers have applied the same\r\nname to the nations over which they were the chiefs. Thus Lesbos[1694]\r\nhas been called Pelasgic, and Homer has called the people bordering on\r\nthe Cilices in the Troad Pelasgic:—\r\n\r\n   “Hippothous from Larissa, for her soil\r\n   Far-famed, the spear-expert Pelasgians brought.”[1695]\r\n\r\nEphorus, when he supposes that they were a tribe of Arcadians, follows\r\nHesiod, who says,\r\n\r\n   “The sons born of the divine Lycaon, whom formerly Pelasgus\r\n   begot.”\r\n\r\nLikewise Æschylus in his Suppliants, or Danaids, makes their race to be\r\nof Argos near Mycenæ. Ephorus likewise says that Peloponnesus was named\r\nPelasgia; and Euripides, in the Archelaus, says,\r\n\r\n   “Danaus, who was the father of fifty daughters, having arrived in\r\n   Argos, inhabited[1696] the city of Inachus, and made a law that\r\n   those who had before borne the name of Pelasgiotæ throughout\r\n   Greece should be called Danai.”\r\n\r\nAnticlides says, that they first colonized about Lemnos and Imbros, and\r\nthat some of their number passed into Italy with Tyrrhenus, the son of\r\nAtys. And the writers on the Athenian Antiquities,[1697] relate of the\r\nPelasgi, that some of them came to Athens, where, on account of their\r\nwanderings, and their settling like birds in any place where they\r\nchanced to come, they were called by the Athenians _Pelargi_.[1698]\r\n\r\n5. They say that the greatest length of Tyrrhenia, which is along the\r\ncoast from Luna to Ostia, is about 2500 stadia; and that its breadth in\r\nthe direction of the mountains is less than half that number. Then from\r\nLuna to Pisa there are more than 400 stadia; from thence to\r\nVolaterræ[1699] 280; thence to [CAS. 222] Poplonium 270; and from\r\nPoplonium to Cossa[1700] near 800, or as some say, 600. Polybius,\r\nhowever, says that there are not[1701] in all 1330.[1702] Of these Luna\r\nis a city and harbour; it is named by the Greeks, the harbour and city\r\nof Selene.[1703] The city is not large, but the harbour[1704] is very\r\nfine and spacious, containing in itself numerous harbours, all of them\r\ndeep near the shore; it is in fact an arsenal worthy of a nation holding\r\ndominion for so long a time over so vast a sea. The harbour is\r\nsurrounded by lofty mountains,[1705] from whence you may view the\r\nsea[1706] and Sardinia, and a great part of the coast on either side.\r\nHere are quarries of marble, both white and marked with green, so\r\nnumerous and large, as to furnish tablets and columns of one block; and\r\nmost of the material for the fine works, both in Rome and the other\r\ncities, is furnished from hence. The transport of the marble is easy, as\r\nthe quarries lie near to the sea, and from the sea they are conveyed by\r\nthe Tiber. Tyrrhenia likewise supplies most of the straightest and\r\nlongest planks for building, as they are brought direct from the\r\nmountains to the river. Between Luna and Pisa flows the Macra,[1707] a\r\ndivision which many writers consider the true boundary of Tyrrhenia and\r\nLiguria. Pisa was founded by the Pisatæ of the Peloponnesus, who went\r\nunder Nestor to the expedition against Troy, but in their voyage home\r\nwandered out of their course, some to Metapontium,[1708] others to the\r\nPisatis; they were, however, all called Pylians. The city lies between\r\nthe two rivers Arno[1709] and Æsar,[1710] at their point of confluence;\r\nthe former of which, though very full, descends from Arretium[1711] not\r\nin one body, but divided into three; the second flows down from the\r\nApennines. Where they fall into one current, the shock between them is\r\nso great as to raise the water to that height, that people standing on\r\neither bank are not able to see each other; so that necessarily the\r\nvoyage up from the sea is difficult. This voyage is about 20 stadia.\r\nThere is a tradition, that when these rivers first descended from the\r\nmountains they were impeded by the inhabitants of the district, lest\r\nfalling together they should inundate the country; however, they\r\npromised not to inundate it, and they have kept their word. This city\r\nappears to have been formerly flourishing, and at the present day it\r\nstill maintains its name, on account of its fertility, its\r\nmarble-quarries, and its wood for building ships, which formerly they\r\nemployed to preserve themselves from danger by sea; for they were more\r\nwarlike than the Tyrrheni, and were constantly irritated by the\r\nLigurians, troublesome neighbours, who dwelt on the coast. At the\r\npresent day the wood is mostly employed for building houses in Rome, and\r\nin the country villas [of the Romans], which resemble in their\r\ngorgeousness Persian palaces.\r\n\r\n6. The country of the Volaterrani[1712] is washed by the sea. Their city\r\nis situated in a deep hollow on the top of a high hill. The wall of the\r\ncity is built round its summit, which is flat and precipitous on every\r\nside. From its base, the ascent upward is fifteen stadia, steep and\r\ndifficult. Here certain of the Tyrrhenians and of those proscribed by\r\nSulla,[1713] took their stand, and having organized four bands,\r\nsustained a siege for two years, and at last secured articles of truce\r\nbefore surrendering the place. Poplonium is situated on a lofty\r\npromontory, which projects into the sea, and forms a chersonesus. It\r\nlikewise sustained a siege about the same time. This little place is now\r\ndeserted, with the exception of the temples and a few houses; the\r\nsea-port, which is situated at the root of the mountain, is better\r\ninhabited, having both a small harbour and ship-sheds. This appears to\r\nme the only one of the ancient Tyrrhenian cities situated on the sea;\r\nthe reason being that this territory affords no harbours. The founders\r\n[of the cities] therefore either avoided the sea altogether, or threw up\r\nfortifications in order that they might not become the ready prey of\r\nthose who might sail against them. On the [CAS. 223] summit [of the\r\ncape] there is a look-out for thunnies.[1714] From this city there is an\r\nindistinct and distant view of Sardinia. Cyrnus,[1715] however, is\r\nnearer, being distant from Sardinia about 60 stadia. While Æthalia[1716]\r\nis much nearer to the continent than either, being distant therefrom\r\nonly 300[1717] stadia, and the same number from Cyrnus. Poplonium is the\r\nbest starting-place to any of the three mentioned islands. We ourselves\r\nobserved them from the height of Poplonium, in which place we saw\r\ncertain mines which had been abandoned, we also saw the craftsmen who\r\nwork the iron brought from Æthalia; for they cannot reduce it into bars\r\nin the furnaces on the island, and it is therefore transferred direct\r\nfrom the mines to the continent. There is another remarkable\r\ncircumstance, that the exhausted mines of the island in course of time\r\nare again refilled similarly to what they say takes place at the\r\n_platamones_[1718] in Rhodes, the marble-quarries in Paros, and the\r\nsalt-mines in India, mentioned by Clitarchus. Eratosthenes was therefore\r\nincorrect in saying that from the mainland you could neither see Cyrnus\r\nnor Sardinia; and so was Artemidorus in his assertion, that both these\r\nplaces lay in the high sea at a distance of 1200 stadia. For whatever\r\nothers might, I certainly could never have seen them at such a distance,\r\nhowever carefully I had looked, particularly Cyrnus. Æthalia has a\r\nharbour named Argoüs,[1719] derived, as they say, from the [ship] Argo,\r\nJason having sailed hither, seeking the abode of Circe as Medea wished\r\nto see that goddess; and that from the sweat scraped off by the\r\nArgonauts and hardened, are formed the variegated pebbles now seen on\r\nthe beach.[1720] This and similar traditions prove what we before\r\nstated, that Homer did not invent them all himself, but, hearing the\r\nnumerous current stories, he merely transferred the scenes to other\r\nlocalities and exaggerated the distances: as he makes Ulysses wander\r\nover the ocean, so does he narrate of Jason, as he too had been renowned\r\nfor his travels: and the same he likewise relates of Menelaus. This is\r\nwhat we have to say of Æthalia.\r\n\r\n7. Cyrnus is called by the Romans Corsica; it is poorly inhabited, being\r\nboth rugged and in many parts entirely inaccessible, so that the\r\nmountaineers, who live by plunder, are more savage than wild beasts.\r\nWhenever any Roman general invades the country, and, penetrating into\r\nthe wilds, seizes a vast number of slaves, it is a marvel to behold in\r\nRome how savage and bestial they appear. For they either scorn to live,\r\nor if they do live, aggravate their purchasers by their apathy and\r\ninsensibility, causing them to regret the purchase-money, however\r\nsmall.[1721] We must remark, however, that some districts are habitable,\r\nand that there are some small cities, for instance Blesino, Charax,\r\nEniconiæ, and Vapanes.[1722] The chorographer[1723] says that the length\r\nof this island is 160 miles, its breadth 70; that the length of Sardinia\r\nis 220, and its breadth 98. According to others, the perimeter of Cyrnus\r\nis said to be about 1200[1724] stadia, and of Sardinia 4000. A great\r\nportion of this latter is rugged and untranquil; another large portion\r\nis fertile in every production, but particularly in wheat. There are\r\nmany cities, some are considerable, as Caralis[1725] and Sulchi.[1726]\r\nThere is however an evil, which must be set against the fertility of\r\nthese places; for during the summer the island is unhealthy, more\r\nparticularly so in the most fertile districts; in addition to this, it\r\nis often ravaged by the mountaineers, whom they call Diagesbes,[1727]\r\nwho formerly were named Iolaënses. For it is said that Iolaus[1728]\r\nbrought hither certain of the children of Hercules, and established\r\nhimself amongst the barbarian [CAS. 225] possessors of the island, who\r\nwere Tyrrhenians. Afterwards the Phœnicians of Carthage became masters\r\nof the island, and, assisted by the inhabitants, carried on war against\r\nthe Romans; but after the subversion of the Carthaginians, the Romans\r\nbecame masters of the whole. There are four nations of mountaineers, the\r\nParati, Sossinati, Balari, and the Aconites. These people dwell in\r\ncaverns. Although they have some arable land, they neglect its\r\ncultivation, preferring rather to plunder what they find cultivated by\r\nothers, whether on the island or on the continent, where they make\r\ndescents, especially upon the Pisatæ. The prefects sent [into Sardinia]\r\nsometimes resist them, but at other times leave them alone, since it\r\nwould cost too dear to maintain an army always on foot in an unhealthy\r\nplace: they have, however, recourse to the arts of stratagem, and taking\r\nadvantage of the custom of the barbarians, who always hold a great\r\nfestival for several days after returning from a plundering expedition,\r\nthey then fall upon them, and capture many. There are rams here which,\r\ninstead of wool, have hair resembling that of a goat; they are called\r\nmusmones, and the inhabitants make corselets of their hides. They\r\nlikewise arm themselves with a pelta and a small sword.\r\n\r\n8. Along the whole coast between Poplonium and Pisa these islands are\r\nclearly visible; they are oblong, and all three nearly parallel,[1729]\r\nrunning towards the south and Libya. Æthalia is by far smaller than\r\neither of the other two. The chorographer says that the shortest passage\r\nfrom Libya to Sardinia is 300[1730] miles. After Poplonium is the city\r\nof Cossæ, situated at a short distance from the sea: there is at the\r\nhead of the bay a high hill upon which it is built; below it lies the\r\nport of Hercules,[1731] and near to it a marsh formed by the sea.[1732]\r\nAt the summit of the cape which commands the gulf is a look-out for\r\nthunnies; for the thunny pursues his course along the coast, from the\r\nAtlantic Ocean as far as Sicily, in search not only of acorns, but also\r\nof the fish which furnishes the purple dye. As one sails along the coast\r\nfrom Cossæ to Ostia there are the towns of Gravisci,[1733] Pyrgi,[1734]\r\nAlsium,[1735] and Fregena.[1736] [From Cossæ] to Gravisci is a distance\r\nof 300 stadia, and between them is the place named Regis-Villa. This is\r\nsaid to have been the royal residence of Maleos the Pelasgian; they\r\nreport that after he had reigned here for some time, he departed with\r\nhis Pelasgians to Athens. These were of the same tribe as those who\r\noccupied Agylla. From Gravisci to Pyrgi is a little less than 180\r\nstadia, and the sea-port town of the Cæretani is 30 stadia farther.\r\n[Pyrgi] contains a temple of Ilethyia[1737] founded by the Pelasgi, and\r\nwhich was formerly rich, but it was plundered by Dionysius the tyrant of\r\nthe Sicilians, at the time[1738] of his voyage to Cyrnus.[1739] From\r\nPyrgi to Ostia is 260 stadia; between the two are Alsium and Fregena.\r\nSuch is our account of the coast of Tyrrhenia.\r\n\r\n9. In the interior of the country, besides the cities already mentioned,\r\nthere are Arretium,[1740] Perusia,[1741] Volsinii,[1742] Sutrium;[1743]\r\nand in addition to these are numerous small cities, as Blera,[1744]\r\nFerentinum,[1745] Falerium,[1746] Faliscum,[1747] Nepita,[1748]\r\nStatonia,[1749] and many others; some of which exist in their original\r\nstate, others have been colonized by the Romans, or partially ruined by\r\nthem in their wars, viz. those they frequently waged against the\r\nVeii[1750] and the Fidenæ.[1751] Some say that the inhabitants of\r\nFalerium are not Tyrrhenians, but Falisci, a distinct nation; others\r\nstate further, that the Falisci speak a language peculiar to themselves;\r\nsome again would make it Æquum-Faliscum on [CAS. 226] the Via Flaminia,\r\nlying between Ocricli[1752] and Rome. Below Mount Soracte[1753] is the\r\ncity of Feronia, having the same name as a certain goddess of the\r\ncountry, highly reverenced by the surrounding people: here is her\r\ntemple, in which a remarkable ceremony is performed, for those possessed\r\nby the divinity pass over a large bed of burning coal and ashes\r\nbarefoot, unhurt. A great concourse of people assemble to assist at the\r\nfestival, which is celebrated yearly, and to see the said spectacle.\r\nArretium,[1754] near the mountains, is the most inland city: it is\r\ndistant from Rome 1200 stadia: from Clusium[1755] [to Rome] is 800\r\nstadia. Near to these [two cities] is Perusia.[1756] The large and\r\nnumerous lakes add to the fertility of this country,[1757] they are\r\nnavigable, and stocked with fish and aquatic birds. Large quantities of\r\ntypha,[1758] papyrus, and anthela[1759] are transported to Rome, up the\r\nrivers which flow from these lakes to the Tiber. Among these are the\r\nlake Ciminius,[1760] and those near the Volsinii,[1761] and\r\nClusium,[1762] and Sabatus,[1763] which is nearest to Rome and the sea,\r\nand the farthest Trasumennus,[1764] near Arretium. Along this is the\r\npass by which armies can proceed from [Cisalpine] Keltica into\r\nTyrrhenia; this is the one followed by Hannibal. There are two; the\r\nother leads towards Ariminum across Ombrica, and is preferable as the\r\nmountains are considerably lower; however, as this was carefully\r\nguarded, Hannibal was compelled to take the more difficult, which he\r\nsucceeded in forcing after having vanquished Flaminius in a decisive\r\nengagement. There are likewise in Tyrrhenia numerous hot springs, which\r\non account of their proximity to Rome, are not less frequented than\r\nthose of Baiæ, which are the most famous of all.\r\n\r\n10. Ombrica lies along the eastern boundary of Tyrrhenia, and commencing\r\nfrom the Apennines, or rather beyond those mountains, [extends] as far\r\nas the Adriatic. For commencing from Ravenna, the Ombrici inhabit the\r\nneighbouring country together with the cities of Sarsina,\r\nAriminum,[1765] Sena,[1766] †and Marinum.†[1767] To their country\r\nlikewise belongs the river Esino,[1768] Mount Cingulum, [the city of]\r\nSentinum,[1769] the river Metaurus, and the Fanum Fortunæ;[1770] for\r\nabout these parts are the boundaries which separate ancient Italy and\r\n[Cisalpine] Keltica on the side next the Adriatic, although the boundary\r\nhas frequently been changed by the chief men of the state. First they\r\nmade the Esino the boundary; afterwards the river Rubicon: the Esino\r\nbeing between Ancona and Sena, and the Rubicon between Ariminum and\r\nRavenna, both of them falling into the Adriatic. At the present day,\r\nhowever, since Italy comprehends the whole country as far as the Alps,\r\nwe need take no further notice of these limits. All allow that\r\nOmbrica[1771] extends as far as Ravenna, as the inhabitants are Ombrici.\r\nFrom Ravenna to Ariminum they say is about 300 stadia. Going from\r\nAriminum to Rome by the Via Flaminia, the whole journey lies through\r\nOmbrica as far as the city of Ocricli[1772] and the Tiber, a distance of\r\n1350 stadia. This, consequently, is the length [of Ombrica]; its breadth\r\nvaries. The cities of considerable magnitude situated on this side the\r\nApennines along the Via Flaminia, are Ocricli on the Tiber,\r\nLaroloni,[1773] and Narnia,[1774] through which the Nera[1775] flows.\r\nThis river discharges itself into the Tiber a little above Ocricli; it\r\nis not navigable for large vessels. After these are Carsuli and\r\nMevania,[1776] past which latter the Teneas[1777] flows, by which river\r\nthe merchandise of the plain is transported in small vessels to the\r\nTiber. There are also other cities well populated, rather on account of\r\nthe route along which they lie, than for their political importance.\r\nSuch are Forum Flaminium,[1778] Nuceria[1779] where wooden vases are\r\nmanufactured, and Forum Sempronium.[1780] Going from Ocricli to\r\nAriminum, on the right of the [CAS. 228] way are Interamna,[1781]\r\nSpoletium,[1782] Asisium,[1783] and Camerta, situated in the mountains\r\nwhich bound Picenum. On the other side[1784] are Ameria,[1785]\r\nTuder,[1786] a well-fortified city, Hispellum,[1787] and Iguvium,[1788]\r\nnear to the passes of the mountain. The whole of this country is\r\nfertile, but rather too mountainous, and producing more rye[1789] than\r\nwheat for the food of the inhabitants. The next district, Sabina, is\r\nmountainous, and borders on Tyrrhenia in like manner. The parts of\r\nLatium which border on these districts and the Apennines are very\r\nrugged. These two nations[1790] commence from the Tiber and Tyrrhenia,\r\nand extend as far as the Apennines which advance obliquely towards the\r\nAdriatic: Ombrica extends, as we have said, beyond as far as the sea. We\r\nhave now sufficiently described the Ombrici.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Sabini occupy a narrow country, its length from the Tiber and the\r\nsmall city of Nomentum[1791] to the Vestini being 1000 stadia. They have\r\nbut few cities, and these have suffered severely in their continual wars\r\n[with the Romans]. Such are Amiternum[1792] and Reate,[1793] which is\r\nnear to the village of Interocrea[1794] and the cold waters at Cotyliæ,\r\nwhich are taken by patients, both as drink and as baths, for the cure of\r\nvarious maladies. The rocks of Foruli,[1795] likewise, belong to the\r\nSabini; fitted rather for rebellion than peaceable habitation. Cures is\r\nnow a small village, although formerly a famous city: whence came Titus\r\nTatius and Numa Pompilius, kings of Rome. From this place is derived the\r\nname of Quirites, which the orators give to the Romans when they address\r\nthe people. Trebula,[1796] Eretum,[1797] and other similar places, must\r\nbe looked upon rather as villages than cities. The whole land [of\r\nSabina] is singularly fertile in olive-trees and vines, it produces also\r\nmany acorns, and besides has excellent cattle: the mules bred at\r\nReate[1798] are much celebrated. In one word the whole of Italy is rich\r\nboth in cattle and vegetable productions; although certain articles may\r\nbe finer in some districts than in others. The race of the Sabini is\r\nextremely ancient, they are Autochthones. The Picentini and Samnitæ\r\ndescend from them, as do the Leucani from these latter, and the Bruttii\r\nagain from these. A proof of their antiquity may be found in the bravery\r\nand valour which they have maintained till the present time.\r\nFabius,[1799] the historian, says that the Romans first knew what wealth\r\nwas when they became masters of this nation. The Via Salaria, which\r\nhowever does not extend far, runs through their country: the Via\r\nNomentana, which commences likewise at the Porta Collina, falls in with\r\nthe Via Salaria near to Eretum, a village of Sabina lying above the\r\nTiber.\r\n\r\n2. Beyond Sabina is Latium, wherein the city of Rome is situated. It\r\ncomprises many places which formed no part of ancient Latium. For the\r\nÆqui, the Volsci, the Hernici, the aborigines around Rome, the Rutuli\r\nwho possessed ancient Ardea, and many other nations, some larger, some\r\nsmaller, formed so many separate states around Rome, when that city was\r\nfirst built. Some of these nations, who dwelt in villages, were governed\r\nby their own laws, and subjected to no common tribe. They say[1800] that\r\nÆneas, with his father Anchises and his child Ascanius, arrived at\r\nLaurentum,[1801] near to Ostia and the bank of the Tiber, where he built\r\na city about 24 stadia above the sea. That Latinus, the king of the\r\naborigines who then dwelt on the site where Rome now stands, employed\r\nhis forces to aid Æneas against the neighbouring Rutuli who inhabited\r\nArdea, (now from Ardea to Rome is a distance of 160 stadia,) and having\r\ngained a victory, he built near to the spot a city, to which he gave the\r\nname of his daughter Lavinia. However, in a second battle, commenced by\r\nthe Rutuli, Latinus fell, and Æneas, being conqueror, [CAS. 229]\r\nsucceeded this prince on the throne, and conferred on his subjects the\r\nname of Latini. After the death both of himself and his father, Ascanius\r\nfounded Alba,[1802] on Mount Albanus,[1803] situated about the same\r\ndistance from Rome as Ardea. Here Romans and Latini conjointly offer\r\nsacrifice to Jupiter. The magistracy all assemble, and during the period\r\nof the solemnity the government of the city is intrusted to some\r\ndistinguished youth. The facts related of Amulius and his brother\r\nNumitor, some of which are fictitious, while others approach nearer the\r\ntruth, occurred four hundred years later. These two brothers, who were\r\ndescended from Ascanius, succeeded conjointly to the government of Alba,\r\nwhich extended as far as the Tiber. However, Amulius the younger, having\r\nexpelled the elder, governed [alone]. Numitor had a son and a daughter;\r\nthe former Amulius treacherously murdered in the chase; the latter, that\r\nshe might remain childless, he made a priestess of Vesta, thus imposing\r\nvirginity upon her. This [daughter] they name Rhea Silvia. Afterwards he\r\ndiscovered that she was pregnant, and when she had given birth to twins,\r\nhe, out of respect to his brother, placed her in confinement, instead of\r\nputting her to death, and exposed the boys by the Tiber according to a\r\nnational usage. According to the mythology, Mars was the father of these\r\nchildren, and when they were exposed they were discovered and suckled by\r\na she-wolf. Faustulus, one of the swine-herds of the place, took and\r\nreared them up, and named one Romulus, the other Remus. (We must\r\nunderstand that Faustulus, who took them up and nourished them, was an\r\ninfluential man, and a subject of Amulius.) Having arrived at man’s\r\nestate, they waged war upon Amulius and his sons; and having slain them,\r\nrestored the government to Numitor. They then returned home and founded\r\nRome, in a locality selected rather through necessity than choice, as\r\nthe site was neither fortified by nature, nor sufficiently large for a\r\ncity of importance. In addition to this, the neighbourhood supplied no\r\ninhabitants; for those who dwelt around, even though touching the very\r\nwalls of the newly founded city, kept to themselves, and would have\r\nnothing at all to do with the Albani. Collatia, Antemnæ, Fidenæ,\r\nLabicum,[1804] and similar places are here alluded to which then were\r\nsmall cities, but are now villages possessed by private individuals;\r\nthey are distant from Rome 30 or 40[1805] stadia, or rather more.\r\nBetween the fifth and sixth mile-stone which marks the distance from\r\nRome there is a place named Festi; this they say was at that time the\r\nlimit of the Roman territory, and at the present day, both here and in\r\nnumerous other places which they consider to have been boundaries, the\r\npriests offer the sacrifice denominated Ambarvia.[1806] They say that,\r\nat the time of the foundation [CAS. 230] [of the city], a dispute arose\r\nin which Remus lost his life. The city being built, Romulus assembled\r\nmen from every quarter, and instituted for an asylum a grove between the\r\ncitadel and the Capitol, to which whoever fled from the neighbouring\r\nstates, he proclaimed as Roman citizens. Not having wives for these men,\r\nhe appointed a horse-race in honour of Neptune, which is celebrated to\r\nthis day. Numbers [of spectators] having assembled, particularly of the\r\nSabini, he commanded that each of those who were in want of a wife,\r\nshould carry off one of the assembled maidens. Titus Tatius, king of the\r\nQuirites, took up arms to avenge the insult, but made peace with Romulus\r\non condition that their kingdoms should be united, and that they should\r\ndivide the sovereignty between them. Tatius, however, was treacherously\r\nassassinated in Lavinium, upon which Romulus, with the consent of the\r\nQuirites, reigned alone. After him Numa Pompilius, formerly a subject of\r\nTatius, assumed the government, by the general desire of the people.\r\nSuch is the most authentic account of the foundation of Rome.\r\n\r\n3. However, there also exists another more ancient and mythical account,\r\nto the effect that Rome was an Arcadian colony planted by Evander. He\r\nentertained Hercules when driving the oxen of Geryon, and being informed\r\nby his mother Nicostrata, (who was skilled in the art of prophecy,) that\r\nwhen Hercules should have completed his labours it was fore-ordained\r\nthat he should be enrolled amongst the gods; he informed him of the\r\nmatter, consecrated to him a grove, and offered sacrifice to him after\r\nthe Grecian mode; a sacrifice which is continued in honour of Hercules\r\nto this day. The Roman historian Cœlius is of opinion that this is a\r\nproof that Rome is a Grecian colony, the sacrifice to Hercules after the\r\nGrecian mode having been brought over from their fatherland. The Romans\r\nalso worship the mother of Evander under the name of Carmentis,[1807]\r\nconsidering her one of the nymphs.\r\n\r\n4. Thus then the Latini originally were few in number, and for the most\r\npart under no subjection to the Romans; but afterwards, being struck by\r\nthe valour of Romulus and the kings who succeeded him, they all\r\nsubmitted. But the Æqui,[1808] the Volsci, the Hernici; and before them\r\nthe Rutuli, the aborigines, the Rhæci, together with certain of the\r\n[CAS. 231] Argyrusci and the Preferni,[1809] being subdued, the whole of\r\ntheir different countries were included under the name of Latium. To the\r\nVolsci pertained the Pomentine plain, bordering on the territory of the\r\nLatini, and the city of Apiola, levelled to the ground[1810] by\r\nTarquinius Priscus. The Æqui principally were neighbours to the\r\nQuirites, whose cities Tarquinius Priscus likewise devastated. His son\r\ntook Suessa,[1811] the metropolis of the Volsci. The Hernici dwelt near\r\nto Lanuvium, Alba, and to Rome itself; neither were Aricia,[1812] the\r\nTellenæ, and Antium[1813] at any great distance. The Albani were at\r\nfirst friendly with the Romans, speaking as they did the same language,\r\nand being likewise of the Latin stock; and though they were under\r\nseparate governments, this did not prevent them from marrying together,\r\nnor from performing in common the sacred ceremonies at Alba, and other\r\ncivil rites. In after-time, however, war having sprung up, Alba was\r\nentirely destroyed with the exception of the temple, and the Albani were\r\ndeclared citizens of Rome. Of the other surrounding cities, those which\r\nresisted were either destroyed or enfeebled, while others, which were\r\nfriendly to the Romans, flourished. At the present day the coast from\r\nOstia to the city of Sinuessa[1814] is denominated the Latin coast;\r\nformerly the country thus designated extended only so far as\r\nCircæum.[1815] The interior also [of Latium] was formerly small; but it\r\nafterwards extended to Campania, the Samnitæ, the Peligni,[1816] and\r\nother nations dwelling around the Apennines.\r\n\r\n5. The whole [of Latium] is fertile, and abounding in every production,\r\nwith the exception of a few districts along the coast, which are marshy\r\nand unhealthy; such as the country of Ardea, the lands between Antium\r\nand Lanuvium as far as Pometia, and certain of the districts of\r\nSetia,[1817] Terracina, and Circæum. Some parts may also be too\r\nmountainous and rocky; but even these are not absolutely idle and\r\nuseless, since they furnish abundant pasturage, wood, and the peculiar\r\nproductions of the marsh and rock; while Cæcubum, which is entirely\r\nmarshy, nourishes a vine, the dendritis,[1818] which produces the most\r\nexcellent wine. Of the maritime cities of Latium, one is Ostia. This\r\ncity has no port, owing to the accumulation of the alluvial deposit\r\nbrought down by the Tiber, which is swelled by numerous rivers; vessels\r\ntherefore bring to anchor further out, but not without danger; however,\r\ngain overcomes every thing, for there is an abundance of lighters in\r\nreadiness to freight and unfreight the larger ships, before they\r\napproach the mouth of the river, and thus enable them to perform their\r\nvoyage speedily. Being lightened of a part of their cargo, they enter\r\nthe river and sail up to Rome, a distance of about 190 stadia. Such is\r\nthe city of Ostia, founded by Ancus Martius. Next in order comes Antium,\r\nwhich city is likewise destitute of any port; it is situated on rocks,\r\nand about 260 stadia distant from Ostia. At the present day it is\r\ndevoted to the leisure and recreation of statesmen from their political\r\nduties, whenever they can find time, and is in consequence covered with\r\nsumptuous mansions suited to such rusticating. The inhabitants of Antium\r\nhad formerly a marine, and even after they were under subjection to the\r\nRomans, took part with the Tyrrhenian pirates. Of this, first, Alexander\r\nsent to complain; after him Demetrius, having taken many of these\r\npirates, sent them to the Romans, saying that he would surrender them\r\ntheir persons on account of their affinity to the Greeks, and remarking\r\nat the same time, that it seemed to him a great impropriety, that those\r\nwho held sway over the whole of Italy should send out pirates, and that\r\nthey who had consecrated in their forum a temple to the honour of the\r\nDioscuri,[1819] whom all denominated the Saviours, should likewise send\r\nto commit acts of piracy on Greece, which was the fatherland of those\r\ndivinities. Hereupon the Romans put a stop to this occupation [piracy].\r\nBetween these two cities is Lavinium, which contains a temple of Venus\r\ncommon to all the Latini, the care of which is intrusted to the priests\r\nof [CAS. 232] Ardea. After this is Laurentum;[1820] and above these lies\r\nArdea, a colony of the Rutuli, 70 stadia from the sea; near to it is\r\nanother temple of Venus, where all the Latini hold a public festival.\r\nThese regions have been ravaged by the Samnitæ, and only the traces of\r\nthe cities left; but even these are reverenced on account of the arrival\r\nof Æneas here, and of the religious rites which they say were bequeathed\r\nfrom those times.\r\n\r\n6. At 290 stadia from Antium is Mount Circæum, insulated by the sea and\r\nmarshes. They say that it contains numerous roots, but this perhaps is\r\nonly to harmonize with the myth relating to Circe. It has a small city,\r\ntogether with a temple to Circe and an altar to Minerva; they likewise\r\nsay that a cup is shown which belonged to Ulysses. Between [Antium and\r\nCircæum] is the river Stura,[1821] which has a station for ships: the\r\nrest of the coast is exposed to the south-west wind,[1822] with the\r\nexception of this small harbour of Circæum.[1823] Above this, in the\r\ninterior, is the Pomentine plain: the region next to this was formerly\r\ninhabited by the Ausonians, who likewise possessed Campania: next after\r\nthese the Osci, who also held part of Campania; now, however, as we have\r\nremarked, the whole, as far as Sinuessa, belongs to the Latini. A\r\npeculiar fate has attended the Osci and Ausonians; for although the Osci\r\nhave ceased to exist as a distinct tribe, their dialect is extant among\r\nthe Romans, dramatic and burlesque pieces composed in it being still\r\nrepresented at certain games which were instituted in ancient times. And\r\nas for the Ausonians, although they never have dwelt by the sea of\r\nSicily,[1824] it is named the Ausonian Sea. At 100 stadia from Circæum\r\nis Tarracina, formerly named Trachina,[1825] on account of its\r\nruggedness; before it is a great marsh, formed by two rivers, the larger\r\nof which is called the Aufidus.[1826] This is the first place where the\r\nVia Appia approaches the sea. This road is paved from Rome to\r\nBrundusium,[1827] and has great traffic. Of the maritime cities, these\r\nalone are situated on it; Tarracina, beyond it Formiæ,[1828]\r\nMinturnæ,[1829] Sinuessa,[1830] and towards its extremity Tarentum and\r\nBrundusium. Near to Tarracina, advancing in the direction of Rome, a\r\ncanal runs by the side of the Via Appia, which is supplied at intervals\r\nby water from the marshes and rivers. Travellers generally sail up it by\r\nnight, embarking in the evening, and landing in the morning to travel\r\nthe rest of their journey by the way: however, during the day the\r\npassage boat is towed by mules.[1831] Beyond is Formiæ, founded by the\r\nLacedæmonians, and formerly called Hormiæ, on account of its excellent\r\nport. Between these [two cities],[1832] is a gulf which they have named\r\nCaiata,[1833] in fact all gulfs are called by the Lacedæmonians Caietæ:\r\nsome, however, say that the gulf received this appellation from\r\n[Caieta], the nurse of Æneas. From Tarracina to the promontory of Caiata\r\nis a length of 100 stadia. Here[1834] are opened vast caverns, which\r\ncontain large and sumptuous mansions. From hence to Formiæ is a distance\r\nof 40 stadia. Between this city and Sinuessa, at a distance of about 80\r\nstadia from each, is Minturnæ. The river Liris,[1835] formerly named the\r\nClanis, flows through it. It descends from the Apennines, passes through\r\nthe country of the Vescini,[1836] and by the village of Fregellæ,\r\n(formerly a famous city,) and so into a sacred grove situated below the\r\ncity, and held in great veneration by the people of Minturnæ. There are\r\ntwo islands, named Pandataria and Pontia,[1837] lying in the high sea,\r\nand clearly discernible from the caverns. Although small, they are well\r\ninhabited, are not at any great distance from each other, and at 250\r\nstadia from the mainland. Cæcubum is situated on the gulf of Caiata, and\r\nnext to it Fundi, a city on the Via Appia. All these places produce\r\nexcellent wines; but those of Cæcubum, Fundi, and Setia[1838] are most\r\nin repute, and so are the Falernian, Alban,[1839] and Statanian wines.\r\nSinuessa is situated in a gulf from which it takes its name, sinus\r\nsignifying [CAS. 234] [in Latin] a gulf. Near to it are some fine\r\nhot-baths, good for the cure of various maladies. Such are the maritime\r\ncities of Latium.\r\n\r\n7. In the interior, the first city above Ostia is Rome; it is the only\r\ncity built on the Tiber. It has been remarked above, that its position\r\nwas fixed, not by choice, but necessity; to this must be added, that\r\nthose who afterwards enlarged it, were not at liberty to select a better\r\nsite, being prevented by what was already built. The first [kings]\r\nfortified the Capitol, the Palatium, and the Collis Quirinalis, which\r\nwas so easy of access, that when Titus Tatius came to avenge the rape of\r\nthe [Sabine] virgins, he took it on the first assault. Ancus Marcius,\r\nwho added Mount Cælius and the Aventine Mount with the intermediate\r\nplain, separated as these places were both from each other and from what\r\nhad been formerly fortified, was compelled to do this of necessity;\r\nsince he did not consider it proper to leave outside his walls, heights\r\nso well protected by nature, to whomsoever might have a mind to fortify\r\nthemselves upon them, while at the same time he was not capable of\r\nenclosing the whole as far as Mount Quirinus. Servius perceived this\r\ndefect, and added the Esquiline and Viminal hills. As these were both of\r\neasy access from without, a deep trench was dug outside them and the\r\nearth thrown up on the inside, thus forming a terrace of 6 stadia in\r\nlength along the inner side of the trench. This terrace he surmounted\r\nwith a wall flanked with towers, and extending from the Colline[1840] to\r\nthe Esquiline gate. Midway along the terrace is a third gate, named\r\nafter the Viminal hill. Such is the Roman rampart, which seems to stand\r\nin need of other ramparts itself. But it seems to me that the first\r\n[founders] were of opinion, both in regard to themselves and their\r\nsuccessors, that Romans had to depend not on fortifications, but on arms\r\nand their individual valour, both for safety and for wealth, and that\r\nwalls were not a defence to men, but men were a defence to walls. At the\r\nperiod of its commencement, when the large and fertile districts\r\nsurrounding the city belonged to others, and while it lay easily open to\r\nassault, there was nothing in its position which could be looked upon as\r\nfavourable; but when by valour and labour these districts became its\r\nown, there succeeded a tide of prosperity surpassing the advantages of\r\nevery other place. Thus, notwithstanding the prodigious increase of the\r\ncity, there has been plenty of food, and also of wood and stone for\r\nceaseless building, rendered necessary by the falling down of houses,\r\nand on account of conflagrations, and of the sales, which seem never to\r\ncease. These sales are a kind of voluntary falling down of houses, each\r\nowner knocking down and rebuilding one part or another according to his\r\nindividual taste. For these purposes the numerous quarries, the forests,\r\nand the rivers which convey the materials, offer wonderful facilities.\r\nOf these rivers, the first is the Teverone,[1841] which flows from Alba,\r\na city of the Latins near to the country of the Marsi, and from thence\r\nthrough the plain below this [city], till it unites with the Tiber.\r\nAfter this come the Nera[1842] and the Timia,[1843] which passing\r\nthrough Ombrica fall into the Tiber, and the Chiana,[1844] which flows\r\nthrough Tyrrhenia and the territory of Clusium.[1845] Augustus Cæsar\r\nendeavoured to avert from the city damages of the kind alluded to, and\r\ninstituted a company of freedmen, who should be ready to lend their\r\nassistance in cases of conflagration;[1846] whilst, as a preventive\r\nagainst the falling of houses, he decreed that all new buildings should\r\nnot be carried so high as formerly, and that those erected along the\r\npublic ways should not exceed seventy feet in height.[1847] But these\r\nimprovements must have ceased only for the facilities afforded by the\r\nquarries, the forests, and the ease of transport.\r\n\r\n8. These advantages accrued to the city from the nature of the country;\r\nbut the foresight of the Romans added others [CAS. 235] besides. The\r\nGrecian cities are thought to have flourished mainly on account of the\r\nfelicitous choice made by their founders, in regard to the beauty and\r\nstrength of their sites, their proximity to some port, and the fineness\r\nof the country. But the Roman prudence was more particularly employed on\r\nmatters which had received but little attention from the Greeks, such as\r\npaving their roads, constructing aqueducts, and sewers, to convey the\r\nsewage of the city into the Tiber. In fact, they have paved the roads,\r\ncut through hills, and filled up valleys, so that the merchandise may be\r\nconveyed by carriage from the ports. The sewers, arched over with hewn\r\nstones, are large enough in some parts for waggons loaded with hay to\r\npass through; while so plentiful is the supply of water from the\r\naqueducts, that rivers may be said to flow through the city and the\r\nsewers, and almost every house is furnished with water-pipes and copious\r\nfountains. To effect which Marcus Agrippa directed his special\r\nattention; he likewise bestowed upon the city numerous ornaments. We may\r\nremark, that the ancients, occupied with greater and more necessary\r\nconcerns, paid but little attention to the beautifying of Rome. But\r\ntheir successors, and especially those of our own day, without\r\nneglecting these things, have at the same time embellished the city with\r\nnumerous and splendid objects. Pompey, divus Cæsar, and Augustus, with\r\nhis children, friends, wife, and sister, have surpassed all others in\r\ntheir zeal and munificence in these decorations. The greater number of\r\nthese may be seen in the Campus Martius, which to the beauties of nature\r\nadds those of art. The size of the plain is marvellous, permitting\r\nchariot-races and other feats of horsemanship without impediment, and\r\nmultitudes to exercise themselves at ball,[1848] in the circus[1849] and\r\nthe palæstra. The structures which surround it, the turf covered with\r\nherbage all the year round, the summits of the hills beyond the Tiber,\r\nextending from its banks with panoramic effect, present a spectacle\r\nwhich the eye abandons with regret. Near to this plain is another\r\nsurrounded with columns, sacred groves, three theatres, an amphitheatre,\r\nand superb temples in close contiguity to each other; and so\r\nmagnificent, that it would seem idle to describe the rest of the city\r\nafter it. For this cause the Romans, esteeming it as the most sacred\r\nplace, have there erected funeral monuments to the most illustrious\r\npersons of either sex. The most remarkable of these is that designated\r\nas the Mausoleum,[1850] which consists of a mound of earth raised upon a\r\nhigh foundation of white marble, situated near the river, and covered to\r\nthe top with ever-green shrubs. Upon the summit is a bronze statue of\r\nAugustus Cæsar, and beneath the mound are the ashes[1851] of himself,\r\nhis relatives, and friends. Behind is a large grove containing charming\r\npromenades. In the centre of the plain,[1852] is the spot where this\r\nprince was reduced to ashes; it is surrounded with a double enclosure,\r\none of marble, the other of iron, and planted within with poplars. If\r\nfrom hence you proceed to visit the ancient forum, which is equally\r\nfilled with basilicas, porticos, and temples, you will there behold the\r\nCapitol, the Palatium, with the noble works which adorn them, and the\r\npiazza of Livia, each successive place causing you speedily to forget\r\nwhat you have before seen. Such is Rome.\r\n\r\n9. Of the other cities of Latium, some are distinguished by a variety of\r\nremarkable objects, others by the celebrated roads which intersect\r\nLatium, being situated either upon, or near to, or between these roads,\r\nthe most celebrated of which are the Via Appia, the Via Latina, and the\r\nVia Valeria. The former of these bounds the maritime portion of Latium,\r\nas far as Sinuessa, the latter extends along Sabina as far as the Marsi,\r\nwhilst between these is the Via Latina, which falls in with the Via\r\nAppia near to Casilinum,[1853] a city distant from Capua[1854] 19\r\nstadia. The Via Latina commences from the Via Appia, branching from it\r\ntowards the left, near to Rome. It passes over the Tusculan mountain,\r\nbetween the city of Tusculum[1855] and Mount Albanus; it then descends\r\nto the little city of Algidum,[1856] and the Pictæ tavern; afterwards\r\nthe Via [CAS. 237] Lavicana joins it, which commences, like the Via\r\nPrænestina, from the Esquiline gate. This road, as well as the Esquiline\r\nplain, the Via Lavicana leaves on the left; it then proceeds a distance\r\nof 120 stadia, or more, when it approaches Lavicum, an ancient city now\r\nin ruins, situated on an eminence; this and Tusculum it leaves on the\r\nright, and terminates near to Pictæ in the Via Latina. This place is 210\r\nstadia distant from Rome. Proceeding thence along the Via Latina there\r\nare noble residences, and the cities Ferentinum,[1857] Frusino,[1858] by\r\nwhich the river Cosa flows, Fabrateria,[1859] by which flows the river\r\nSacco,[1860] Aquinum,[1861] a large city, by which flows the great river\r\nMelfa,[1862] Interamnium, situated at the confluence of two rivers, the\r\nGarigliano and another, Casinum, also an important city, and the last of\r\nthose belonging to Latium. For Teanum, called Sidicinum,[1863] which\r\nlies next in order, shows by its name that it belongs to the nation of\r\nthe Sidicini. These people are Osci, a surviving nation of the Campani,\r\nso that this city, which is the largest of those situated upon the Via\r\nLatina, may be said to be Campanian; as well as that of Cales,[1864]\r\nanother considerable city which lies beyond, and is contiguous to\r\nCasilinum.[1865]\r\n\r\n10. As to the places situated on either side of the Via Latina, those on\r\nthe right are between it and the Via Appia; of their number are\r\nSetia[1866] and Signia,[1867] which produce wine, that of Setia being\r\none of the dearest wines, and that called Signium the best for\r\nstrengthening the stomach. Before this[1868] are Privernum,[1869]\r\nCora,[1870] Suessa,[1871] ‘Trapontium,’[1872] Velitræ,[1873]\r\nAletrium,[1874] and also Fregellæ,[1875] by which the Garigliano flows,\r\nwhich discharges itself [into the sea] near Minturnæ. Fregellæ, though\r\nnow a village, was formerly a considerable city, and the chief of the\r\nsurrounding places we have just named. Even now their inhabitants throng\r\nto it on market days, and for the performance of certain religious\r\nsolemnities. Its defection from the Romans was the cause of its\r\nruin.[1876] Both these, and also the cities lying on the Via Latina and\r\nbeyond, situated in the territories of the Hernici, Æqui, and Volsci,\r\nwere for the most part founded by the Romans. To the left of the Via\r\nLatina, the cities between it and the Via Valeria, are, Gabii,[1877]\r\nstanding in the Via Prænestina, it possesses a stone-quarry, in greater\r\ndemand at Rome than any other, and is at an equal distance of about 100\r\nstadia between Rome and Præneste.[1878] Then Præneste, of which we shall\r\nhave occasion presently to speak. Then, in the mountains above Præneste,\r\nCapitulum, a small city of the Hernici, and Anagnia,[1879] a\r\nconsiderable city; Cereate,[1880] and Sora, by which the river\r\nGarigliano[1881] flows as it passes on to Fregellæ, and Minturnæ. After\r\nthese there are other places, and finally, Venafrum,[1882] from whence\r\ncomes the finest oil. This city is situated on a high hill by the foot\r\nof which flows the Volturno,[1883] which passing by Casilinum,[1884]\r\ndischarges itself [into the sea] at a city[1885] bearing the same name\r\nas itself. Æsernia[1886] and Alliphæ,[1887] cities of the Samnites, the\r\nformer was destroyed in the Marsian war,[1888] the other still remains.\r\n\r\n11. The Via Valeria, commencing from Tibura,[1889] leads to the country\r\nof the Marsi, and to Corfinium,[1890] the metropolis of the Peligni.\r\nUpon it are situated the Latin cities of Valeria,[1891] Carseoli,[1892]\r\nAlba,[1893] and near to it the city of Cuculum.[1894] Within sight of\r\nRome are Tibura, Præneste, and Tusculum.[1895] At Tibura is a temple of\r\nHercules, and a cataract formed by the fall of the Teverone,[1896]\r\n(which is here navigable,) from a great height into a deep and wooded\r\nravine close to the city. From thence the river flows through a highly\r\nfertile plain along by [CAS. 238] the Tiburtine stone-quarries, those of\r\nthe Gabii, and those denominated the red-stone quarries. As both the\r\ncarriage from the quarries and the conveyance by river are easy, most of\r\nthe Roman edifices are built of materials from hence. In this plain flow\r\nthe cold waters called Albula, they spring from numerous fountains, and\r\nare taken both as a beverage and as baths,[1897] for the cure of various\r\ndiseases. Of the same kind are the Labanæ,[1898] not far from these, on\r\nthe Via Nomentana, and near to Eretum.[1899] At Præneste is the\r\ncelebrated temple and oracle of Fortune. Both this and the preceding\r\ncity are situated on the same chain of mountains, and are distant from\r\neach other 100 stadia. Præneste is 200 stadia from Rome, Tibura less\r\nthan that distance. They are said to be both of Grecian foundation,\r\nPræneste being formerly named Polystephanus. They are both fortified,\r\nbut Præneste is the stronger place of the two, having for its citadel a\r\nlofty mountain, which overhangs the town, and is divided at the back\r\nfrom the adjoining mountain range by a neck of land. This mountain is\r\ntwo stadia higher than the neck in direct altitude. In addition to these\r\n[natural] defences, the city is furnished on all sides with\r\nsubterraneous passages, which extend to the plains, and some of which\r\nserve to convey water, while others form secret ways; it was in one of\r\nthese that Marius[1900] perished, when he was besieged. Other cities are\r\nin most instances benefited by a strong position, but to the people of\r\nPræneste it has proved a bane, owing to the civil wars of the Romans.\r\nFor hither the revolutionary movers take refuge, and when at last they\r\nsurrender, in addition to the injury sustained by the city during the\r\nwar, the country is confiscated, and the guilt thus imputed to the\r\nguiltless. The river Verestis[1901] flows through this region. The said\r\ncities are to the east of Rome.\r\n\r\n12. But within-side the chain of mountains, [where these cities are\r\nsituated,] there is another ridge, leaving a valley between it and Mount\r\nAlgidus; it is lofty, and extends as far as Mount Albanus.[1902] It is\r\non this ridge that Tusculum is situated, a city which is not wanting in\r\nadornment, being entirely surrounded by ornamental plantations and\r\nedifices, particularly that part of it which looks towards Rome. For on\r\nthis side Tusculum presents a fertile hill, well irrigated, and with\r\nnumerous gentle slopes embellished with majestic palaces. Contiguous are\r\nthe undulating slopes of Mount Albanus, which are equally fertile and\r\nornamented. Beyond are plains which extend some of them to Rome and its\r\nenvirons, others to the sea; these latter are unhealthy, but the others\r\nare salubrious and well cultivated. Next after Albanum is the city\r\nAricia, on the Appian Way. It is 160 stadia from Rome. This place is\r\nsituated in a hollow, and has a strong citadel.[1903] Beyond it on one\r\nside of the way is Lanuvium,[1904] a Roman city on the right of the Via\r\nAppia, and from which both the sea and Antium may be viewed. On the\r\nother side is the Artemisium,[1905] which is called Nemus,[1906] on the\r\nleft side of the way, leading from Aricia to the temple.[1907] They say\r\nthat it is consecrated to Diana Taurica, and certainly the rites\r\nperformed in this temple are something barbarous and Scythic. They\r\nappoint as priest a fugitive who has murdered the preceding priest with\r\nhis own hand. Apprehensive of an attack upon himself, the priest is\r\nalways armed with a sword, ready for resistance. The temple is in a\r\ngrove, and before it is a [CAS. 240] lake of considerable size. The\r\ntemple and water are surrounded by abrupt and lofty precipices, so that\r\nthey seem to be situated in a deep and hollow ravine. The springs by\r\nwhich the lake is filled are visible. One of these is denominated\r\nEgeria, after the name of a certain divinity; however, their course on\r\nleaving the lake is subterraneous, but they may be observed at some\r\ndistance, when they rise to the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n13. Near to these localities is Mount Albanus,[1908] which is much\r\nhigher than either the Artemisium or the heights surrounding it,\r\nalthough these are sufficiently lofty and precipitous. It has likewise a\r\nlake,[1909] much larger than that of the Artemisium. Further forward\r\nthan these are the cities on the Via Latina, we have already mentioned.\r\nAlba[1910] is the most inland of all the Latin cities; it borders on the\r\nMarsi, and is situated on a high hill near to Lake Fucinus. This [lake]\r\nis vast as a sea, and is of great service to the Marsi and all the\r\nsurrounding nations. They say, that at times its waters rise to the\r\nheight of the mountains which surround it, and at others subside so\r\nmuch, that the places which had been covered with water reappear and may\r\nbe cultivated; however, the subsidings of the waters occur irregularly\r\nand without previous warning, and are followed by their rising again;\r\nthe springs fail altogether and gush out again after a time; as they say\r\nis the case with the Amenanus,[1911] which flows through Catana,[1912]\r\nfor after remaining dry for a number of years, it again flows. It is\r\nreported that the Marcian[1913] water, which is drunk at Rome in\r\npreference to any other, has its source in [Lake] Fucinus. As Alba is\r\nsituated in the depths of the country, and is besides a strong position,\r\nthe Romans have often employed it as a place of security, for lodging\r\nimportant prisoners.[1914]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After having commenced with the nations about the Alps, and the\r\nApennine mountains which are near to these, we proceeded from thence and\r\npassed through that portion of the hither country lying between the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea and the Apennine mountains, which incline towards the\r\nAdriatic, as far as the Samnites and the Campani. We will now return\r\nagain, and describe the mountaineers, and those who dwell at the foot of\r\nthe mountains; whether on the coast of the Adriatic, or in the interior.\r\nThus, we must recommence from the boundaries of Keltica.[1915]\r\n\r\n2. After the cities of the Ombrici, which are comprised between\r\nAriminum[1916] and Ancona, comes Picenum. The Picentini proceeded\r\noriginally from the land of the Sabini. A woodpecker led the way for\r\ntheir chieftains, and from this bird they have taken their name, it\r\nbeing called in their language Picus, and is regarded as sacred to Mars.\r\nThey inhabit the plains extending from the mountains to the sea; the\r\nlength of their country considerably exceeds its breadth; the soil is\r\nevery where good, but better fitted for the cultivation of fruits than\r\ngrain. Its breadth, from the mountains to the sea varies in different\r\nparts. But its length; from the river Æsis[1917] to Castrum,[1918]\r\nsailing round the coast, is 800 stadia. Of its cities, Ancona is of\r\nGrecian origin, having been founded by the Syracusans who fled from the\r\ntyranny of Dionysius. It is situated upon a cape, which bending round\r\ntowards the north forms a harbour; and it abounds in wine and wheat.\r\nNear to it is the city of Auxumon,[1919] at a little distance from the\r\nsea. After it are Septempeda,[1920] Pneuentia,[1921] Potentia,[1922] and\r\nFirmum Picenum,[1923] with its port of Castellum.[1924] Beyond, is the\r\ntemple of Cupra,[1925] built and dedicated by the Tyrrheni to Juno, who\r\nis named by them Cupra; and after it the river Tronto,[1926] [CAS. 241]\r\nwith a city of the same name.[1927] Beyond this is Castrum Novum,[1928]\r\nand the river Piomba,[1929] flowing from the city of Adria,[1930] and\r\nhaving [at its mouth] the naval station of Adria, which bears the same\r\nname as itself. In the interior is [the city of Adria] itself and\r\nAsculum Picenum,[1931] a very strong position, upon which is built a\r\nwall: the mountains which surround it are not accessible to\r\narmies.[1932] Above Picenum are the Vestini,[1933] the Marsi,[1934] the\r\nPeligni,[1935] the Marucini,[1936] and the Frentani,[1937] a Samnitic\r\nnation possessing the hill-country, and extending almost to the sea. All\r\nthese nations are small, but extremely brave, and have frequently given\r\nthe Romans proofs of their valour, first as enemies, afterwards as\r\nallies; and finally, having demanded the liberty and rights of citizens,\r\nand being denied, they revolted and kindled the Marsian war.[1938] They\r\ndecreed that Corfinium,[1939] the metropolis of the Peligni, should be\r\nthe capital for all the Italians instead of Rome: made it their place\r\nd’armes, and new-named it Italica. Then, having convoked deputies from\r\nall the people friendly to their design, they created consuls[1940] and\r\nprætors, and maintained the war for two[1941] years, until they had\r\nobtained the rights for which they struggled. The war was named the\r\nMarsian[1942] war, because that nation commenced the insurrection, and\r\nparticularly on account of Pompædius.[1943] These nations live generally\r\nin villages, nevertheless they are possessed of certain cities, some of\r\nwhich are at some little distance from the sea, as Corfinium,\r\nSulmo,[1944] Maruvium,[1945] and Teatea[1946] the metropolis of the\r\nMarrucini. Others are on the coast, as Aternum[1947] on the Picentine\r\nboundary, so named from the river [Aternus], which separates the Vestini\r\nfrom the Marrucini. This river flows from the territory of Amiternum and\r\nthrough the Vestini, leaving on its right the Marrucini, who lie above\r\nthe Peligni, [at the place where the river] is crossed by a bridge. The\r\ncity, which bears the same name, (viz. Aternum,) belongs to the Vestini,\r\nbut its port is used in common both by the Peligni and the Marrucini.\r\nThe bridge I have mentioned is about 24 stadia from Corfinium. After\r\nAternum is Orton,[1948] a naval arsenal of the Frentani, and Buca,[1949]\r\nwhich belongs to the same people, and is conterminous with the Apulian\r\nTeanum.[1950] †Ortonium[1951] is situated in the territory of the\r\nFrentani. It is rocky, and inhabited by banditti, who construct their\r\ndwellings of the wrecks of ships, and lead [CAS. 242] otherwise a savage\r\nlife.† Between Orton and Aternum is the river Sagrus,[1952] which\r\nseparates the Frentani from the Peligni. From Picenum to the Apuli,\r\nnamed by the Greeks the Daunii,[1953] sailing round the coast, is\r\na distance of about 490[1954] stadia.\r\n\r\n3. Next in order after Latium is Campania, which extends along the\r\n[Tyrrhenian] Sea; above it is Samnium, in the interior, extending as far\r\nas the Frentani and Daunii; and beyond are the Daunii, and the other\r\nnations as far as the Strait of Sicily. We shall in the first place\r\nspeak of Campania. From Sinuessa[1955] to Misenum[1956] the coast forms\r\na vast gulf; beyond this is another gulf still larger, which they name\r\nthe Crater.[1957] It is enclosed by the two promontories of Misenum and\r\nthe Athenæum.[1958] It is along the shores of these [two gulfs] that the\r\nwhole of Campania is situated. This plain is fertile above all others,\r\nand entirely surrounded by fruitful hills and the mountains of the\r\nSamnites and Osci. Antiochus says that this country was formerly\r\ninhabited by the Opici, and that these were called Ausones. Polybius\r\nappears to consider these as two people, for he says that the Opici and\r\nAusones inhabit the country around the Crater.[1959] Others, however,\r\nstate that it was originally inhabited by Opici and Ausones, but was\r\nafterwards seized on by a nation of the Osci, who were driven out by the\r\nCumæi, and these again by the Tyrrheni. Thus the possession of the plain\r\nwas much disputed on account of its great fertility. [They add that the\r\nTyrrheni] built there twelve cities, and named the metropolis Capua. But\r\nluxury having made them effeminate, in the same way that they had\r\nformerly been driven from the banks of the Po, they were now forced to\r\nabandon this country to the Samnites; who in their turn fell before the\r\nRomans. One proof of the fertility of this country is, that it produces\r\nthe finest corn. I allude to the grain from which a groat is made\r\nsuperior to all kinds of rice, and to almost all other farinacious food.\r\nThey say that some of the plains are cropped all the year round; twice\r\nwith rye, the third time with panic, and occasionally a fourth time\r\nwith vegetables. It is likewise from hence that the Romans procure their\r\nfinest wines, the Falernian, the Statanian, and the Calenian. That of\r\nSurrentum[1960] is now esteemed equal to these, it having been lately\r\ndiscovered that it can be kept to ripen. In addition to this, the whole\r\ncountry round Venafrum, bordering on the plains, is rich in olives.\r\n\r\n4. The maritime cities [of Campania], after Sinuessa, are\r\nLiternum,[1961] where is the sepulchral monument of the first of the two\r\nScipios, surnamed Africanus; it was here that he passed the last days of\r\nhis life, having abandoned public affairs in disgust at the intrigues of\r\ncertain opponents. A river of the same name[1962] flows by this city. In\r\nlike manner the Vulturnus bears the same name as the city[1963] founded\r\non it, which comes next in order: this river flows through\r\nVenafrum[1964] and the midst of Campania. After these [cities] comes\r\nCumæ,[1965] the most ancient settlement[1966] of the Chalcidenses and\r\nCumæans, for it is the oldest of all [the Greek cities] in Sicily or\r\nItaly. The leaders of the expedition, Hippocles the Cumæan and\r\nMegasthenes of Chalcis, having mutually agreed that one of the nations\r\nshould have the management of the colony, and the other the honour of\r\nconferring upon it its own name. Hence at the present day it is named\r\nCumæ, while at the same time it is said to have been founded by the\r\nChalcidenses. At first this city was highly prosperous, as well as the\r\nPhlegræan[1967] plain, which mythology has made the scene of the\r\nadventures of the giants, for no other reason, as it appears, than\r\nbecause the fertility of the country had given rise to battles for its\r\npossession. Afterwards, however, the Campanians becoming masters[1968]\r\nof the city, inflicted much injustice on the [CAS. 243] inhabitants, and\r\neven violated their wives. Still, however, there remain numerous traces\r\nof the Grecian taste, their temples, and their laws. Some are of opinion\r\nthat Cumæ was so called from τὰ κύματα, the waves, the sea-coast near it\r\nbeing rocky and exposed. These people have excellent fisheries. On the\r\nshores of this gulf there is a scrubby forest, extending over numerous\r\nacres of parched and sandy land. This they call the Gallinarian[1969]\r\nwood. It was there that the admirals of Sextus Pompeius assembled their\r\ngangs of pirates, at the time when he drew Sicily into revolt.[1970]\r\n\r\n5. Near to Cumæ is the promontory of Misenum,[1971] and between them is\r\nthe Acherusian Lake,[1972] which is a muddy estuary of the sea. Having\r\ndoubled Misenum, you come to a harbour at the very foot of the\r\npromontory. After this the shore runs inland, forming a deeply indented\r\nbay, on which are Baïæ and the hot springs, much used, both as a\r\nfashionable watering-place, and for the cure of diseases. Contiguous to\r\nBaïæ is the Lucrine Lake,[1973] and within this the Lake Avernus,[1974]\r\nwhich converts into a peninsula the land stretching from the maritime\r\ndistrict, situated between it and Cumæ, as far as Cape Misenum, for\r\nthere is only an isthmus of a few stadia, across which a subterraneous\r\nroad is cut [from the head of the gulf of Avernus] to Cumæ and the sea\r\n[shore] on which it stands. Former writers, mingling fable with history,\r\nhave applied to Avernus the expressions of Homer in his Invocation of\r\nDeparted Spirits,[1975] and relate that here formerly was an oracle of\r\nthe dead,[1976] and that it was to this place that Ulysses came.\r\nHowever, this gulf of Avernus is deep even near the shore, with an\r\nexcellent entrance, and is both as to its size and nature a harbour; but\r\nit is not used, on account of the Lucrine Gulf which lies before it, and\r\nis both large and somewhat shallow. The Avernus is surrounded with steep\r\nhills which encompass the whole of it, with the exception of the\r\nentrance. These hills, now so beautifully cultivated were formerly\r\ncovered with wild forests, gigantic and impenetrable, which overshadowed\r\nthe gulf, imparting a feeling of superstitious awe. The inhabitants\r\naffirm that birds, flying over the lake, fall into the water,[1977]\r\nbeing stifled by the vapours rising from it, a phenomenon of all\r\nPlutonian[1978] localities. They believed, in fact, that this place was\r\na Plutonium, around which the Kimmerians used to dwell, and those who\r\nsailed into the place made sacrifice and propitiatory offerings to the\r\ninfernal deities, as they were instructed by the priests who ministered\r\nat the place. There is here a spring of water near to the sea fit for\r\ndrinking, from which, however, every one abstained, as they supposed it\r\nto be water from the Styx: [they thought likewise] that the oracle of\r\nthe dead was situated some where here; and the hot springs near to the\r\nAcherusian Lake indicated the proximity of Pyriphlegethon. Ephorus,\r\npeopling this place with Kimmerii, tells us that they dwell in\r\nunder-ground habitations, named by them Argillæ, and that these\r\ncommunicate with one another by means of certain subterranean passages;\r\nand that they conduct strangers through them to the oracle, which is\r\nbuilt far below the surface of the earth. They live on the mines\r\ntogether with the profits accruing from the oracle, and grants made to\r\nthem by the king [of the country]. It was a traditional custom for the\r\nservants of the oracle never to behold the sun, and only to quit their\r\ncaverns at night. It was on this account that the poet said,\r\n\r\n                   “On them the Sun\r\n   Deigns not to look with his beam-darting eye.”[1979]\r\n\r\nAt last, however, these men were exterminated by one of the kings, the\r\noracle having deceived him; but [adds Ephorus] the oracle is still in\r\nexistence, though removed to another [CAS. 245] place. Such were the\r\nmyths related by our ancestors. But now that the wood surrounding the\r\nAvernus has been cut down by Agrippa, the lands built upon, and a\r\nsubterranean passage cut from Avernus to Cumæ, all these appear fables.\r\nPerhaps[1980] Cocceius, who made this subterranean passage,[1981] wished\r\nto follow the practice of the Kimmerians we have already described, or\r\nfancied that it was natural to this place that its roads should be made\r\nunder-ground.\r\n\r\n6. The Lucrine gulf extends in breadth as far as Baïæ; it is separated\r\nfrom the sea by a bank eight stadia in length, and the breadth of a\r\ncarriage-way; this they say was constructed by Hercules when he drove\r\naway the oxen of Geryon. But as the wave covered its surface in stormy\r\nweather, rendering it difficult to pass on foot, Agrippa has repaired\r\nit. Small vessels can put into it, but it is useless as a harbour.[1982]\r\nIt contains abundant oyster-beds. Some take this to be the Acherusian\r\nLake, while Artemidorus confounds it with Avernus. They say that Baïæ\r\ntook its name from Baïus one of the companions of Ulysses, and Misenum\r\nfrom Misenus. Beyond is the strand and city of Dicæarchia. Formerly it\r\nwas nothing but a naval station of the Cumæi. It was built on an\r\neminence. But at the time of the war with Hannibal, the Romans\r\nestablished a colony there, and changed its name into Puteoli,[1983] [an\r\nappellation derived] from its wells; or, according to others, from the\r\nstench of its waters, the whole district from hence to Baïæ and Cumæ\r\nbeing full of sulphur, fire, and hot-springs. Some too are of opinion\r\nthat it was on this account [that the country about] Cumæ was named\r\nPhlegra, and that the fables of the giants struck down by thunderbolts\r\nowe their origin to these eruptions of fire and water. This city has\r\nbecome a place of extensive commerce, having artificially constructed\r\nharbours, which were much facilitated by the facile nature of the sand,\r\nwhich contains much gypsum, and will cement and consolidate thoroughly.\r\nFor mixing this sand with chalk-stones they construct moles in the sea,\r\nthus forming bays along the open coast, in which the largest transport\r\nships may safely ride. Immediately above the city lies the\r\nForum-Vulcani,[1984] a plain surrounded with hills which seem to be on\r\nfire, having in many parts mouths emitting smoke, frequently accompanied\r\nby a terrible rumbling noise; the plain itself is full of drifted\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\n7. After Dicæarchia is Neapolis,[1985] [founded[1986] originally] by the\r\nCumæi, but afterwards being peopled by Chalcidians, and certain\r\nPithecussæans and Athenians,[1987] it was on this account denominated\r\nNaples.[1988] Here is pointed out the tomb of [CAS. 246] Parthenope, one\r\nof the sirens, and a gymnastic sport is celebrated by command of an\r\noracle. In course of time the inhabitants, having disagreed amongst\r\nthemselves, admitted certain Campanians; thus being forced to regard in\r\nthe light of friends those most inimical to them, since their friends\r\nwere hostile. This is proved by the names of their demarchi, the earlier\r\nof which are Grecian, but the latter a mixture of Campanian with the\r\nGrecian names. Many traces of Grecian institution are still preserved,\r\nthe gymnasia, the ephebeia,[1989] the fratriæ,[1990] and the Grecian\r\nnames of people who are Roman citizens. At the present time they\r\ncelebrate, every fifth year, public games for music and gymnastic\r\nexercises during many days, which rival the most famous games of Greece.\r\nThere is here a subterranean passage, similar to that at Cumæ,[1991]\r\nextending for many stadia along the mountain,[1992] between\r\nDicæarchia[1993] and Neapolis: it is sufficiently broad to let carriages\r\npass each other, and light is admitted from the surface of the mountain,\r\nby means of numerous apertures cut through a great depth.[1994] Naples\r\nalso has hot springs and baths not at all inferior in quality to those\r\nat Baïæ, but much less frequented, for another city has arisen there,\r\nnot less than Dicæarchia, one palace after another having been built.\r\nNaples still preserves the Grecian mode of life, owing to those who\r\nretire hither from Rome for the sake of repose, after a life of labour\r\nfrom childhood, and to those whose age or weakness demands relaxation.\r\nBesides these, Romans who find attractions in this style of life, and\r\nobserve the numbers of persons dwelling there, are attracted by the\r\nplace, and make it their abode.\r\n\r\n8. Following this is the fortress of Heraclæum,[1995] built upon a\r\npromontory which projects out into the sea, and which, on account of the\r\nprevalence of the south-west wind, is a very healthy spot. The\r\nOsci[1996] originally possessed both this and Pompeia,[1997] which is\r\nnext to it, by which the river Sarno[1998] flows; afterwards the\r\nTyrrheni and Pelasgi,[1999] and then the Samnites[2000] obtained\r\npossession of them, and the last[2001] in their turn were driven from\r\nthese regions. Pompeia is the port for Nola,[2002] Nuceria,[2003] and\r\nAcerræ, which bears the same name as the city near to Cremona. It is\r\nbuilt on the river Sarno, by which merchandise is received and exported.\r\nAbove these places is Mount Vesuvius, which is covered with very\r\nbeautiful fields, excepting its summit, a great part of which is level,\r\nbut wholly sterile. It appears ash-coloured to the eye, cavernous\r\nhollows appear formed of blackened stones, looking as if they had been\r\nsubjected to the action of fire. From this we may infer that the place\r\nwas formerly in a burning state with live craters, which however became\r\nextinguished on the failing of the fuel. Perhaps this [volcano] may have\r\nbeen the cause of the fertility of the surrounding country, the same as\r\noccurs in Catana, where they say that that portion which has been\r\ncovered with ashes thrown up by the fires of Ætna is most excellent for\r\nthe vine. The land about Vesuvius contains fat, and a soil which has\r\nbeen subjected to fire, and is very strong and productive of fruit: when\r\nthis fat superabounds, it is apt, like all sulphurous substances, to\r\ntake fire, but being dried up by evaporation, extinguished, and\r\npulverized, it becomes a productive earth. Adjoining [CAS. 247] Pompeia\r\nis Surrentum,[2004] [a city] of the Campanians, from whence the\r\nAthenæum,[2005] called by some the promontory of the Sirenusæ, projects\r\n[into the sea]; upon its summit is the temple of Minerva, founded by\r\nUlysses. From hence to the island of Capreas the passage is short; after\r\ndoubling the promontory you encounter various desert and rocky little\r\nislands, which are called the Sirenusæ.[2006] On the side towards\r\nSurrentum there is shown a temple with the ancient offerings of those\r\nwho held this place in veneration. Here is the end of the bay named\r\nCrater,[2007] which is bounded by the two promontories of Misenum[2008]\r\nand the Athenæum, both looking towards the south. The whole is adorned\r\nby the cities we have described, by villas, and plantations, so close\r\ntogether that to the eye they appear but one city.\r\n\r\n9. In front of Misenum lies the island of Prochyta,[2009] which has been\r\nrent from the Pithecussæ.[2010] Pithecussæ was peopled by a colony of\r\nEretrians and Chalcidians, which was very prosperous on account of the\r\nfertility of the soil and the productive gold-mines; however, they\r\nabandoned the island on account of civil dissensions, and were\r\nultimately driven out by earthquakes, and eruptions of fire, sea, and\r\nhot waters. It was on account of these eruptions, to which the island is\r\nsubject, that the colonists sent by Hiero,[2011] the king of Syracuse,\r\nabandoned the island, together with the town which they had built, when\r\nit was taken possession of by the Neapolitans. This explains the myth\r\nconcerning Typhon, who, they say, lies beneath the island, and when he\r\nturns himself, causes flames and water to rush forth, and sometimes even\r\nsmall islands to rise in the sea, containing springs of hot water.\r\nPindar throws more credibility into the myth, by making it comformable\r\nto the actual phenomena, for the whole strait from Cumæa to Sicily is\r\nsubigneous, and below the sea has certain galleries which form a\r\ncommunication between [the volcanos[2012] of the islands[2013]] and\r\nthose of the mainland. He shows that Ætna is on this account of the\r\nnature described by all, and also the Lipari Islands, with the regions\r\naround Dicæarchia, Neapolis, Baïæ, and the Pithecussæ. And mindful\r\nhereof, [Pindar] says that Typhon lies under the whole of this space.\r\n\r\n   “Now indeed the sea-girt shores beyond Cumæ, and Sicily,\r\n      press on his shaggy breast.”[2014]\r\n\r\nTimæus,[2015] who remarks that many paradoxical accounts were related by\r\nthe ancients concerning the Pithecussæ, states, nevertheless, that a\r\nlittle before his time, Mount Epomeus,[2016] in the middle of the\r\nisland, being shaken by an earthquake, vomited forth fire; and that the\r\nland between it and the coast was driven out into the sea. That the\r\npowdered soil, after being whirled on high, was poured down again upon\r\nthe island in a whirlwind. That the sea retired from it to a distance of\r\nthree stadia, but after remaining so for a short time it returned, and\r\ninundated the island, thus extinguishing the fire. And that the\r\ninhabitants of the continent fled at the noise, from the sea-coast, into\r\nthe interior of Campania. It seems that the hot-springs[2017] here are a\r\nremedy for those afflicted with gravel. Capreæ[2018] anciently possessed\r\ntwo small cities, afterwards but one. The Neapolitans possessed this\r\nisland, but having lost Pithecussæ in war, they received it again from\r\nCæsar Augustus, giving him in exchange Capreæ. This [island] having thus\r\nbecome the property of that prince, he [CAS. 248] has ornamented it with\r\nnumerous edifices. Such then are the maritime cities of Campania, and\r\nthe islands lying opposite to it.\r\n\r\n10. In the interior is the metropolis, Capua, being, as the etymon of\r\nthe name signifies, the head; for in regard to it all the other cities\r\nappear small, excepting Teanum-Sidicinum,[2019] which is a very\r\nconsiderable place. This city lies on the Via Appia, as also the others\r\nwhich lead from hence to Brundusium, [viz.] Callateria,[2020]\r\nCaudium,[2021] and Beneventum.[2022] On the side of Rome is\r\nCasilinum,[2023] situated on the river Vulturnus.[2024] Here 540 men of\r\nPræneste sustained against Hannibal in the height of his power so\r\ndesperate a siege, that by reason of the famine, a rat[2025] was sold\r\nfor two hundred drachmæ, the seller dying [of hunger], but the purchaser\r\nbeing saved. Hannibal observing some of them sowing turnip-seed near to\r\nthe wall, admired, as well he might, the patient courage of these men,\r\nwho hoped to hold out in the mean while, until these turnips should be\r\nready for food. However, we are assured that they all survived, with the\r\nexception of a few who perished either by famine or in war.\r\n\r\n11. In addition to those just spoken of, there are these Campanian\r\ncities which we have already mentioned, viz. Cales,[2026] and\r\nTeanum-Sidicinum, the limits of which are respectively marked out by the\r\ntwo temples of Fortune situated on either side of the Via Latina.\r\nBesides these are Suessula,[2027] Atella,[2028] Nola,[2029]\r\nNuceria,[2030] Acerræ,[2031] Abella,[2032] with other smaller\r\nsettlements, some of which are said to be Samnite.[2033] The Samnites,\r\nby making incursions into Latium as far as Ardea, and afterwards\r\ndevastating Campania itself, greatly extended their power. The\r\nCampanians, being otherwise accustomed to a despotic government, yielded\r\nready obedience to their commands. At the present day they have been\r\nalmost entirely exterminated by the various Roman generals, and last of\r\nall by Sulla, who was absolute master of the republic. He, after having\r\nby numerous battles extinguished the Italian revolt, observing that the\r\nSamnites, almost without exception, remained in one body, and with one\r\nsole intention, so that they had even marched upon Rome itself, gave\r\nthem battle under the walls, and as he had issued orders to make no\r\nprisoners, many of them were cut to pieces on the field, while the\r\nremainder, said to be about three or four thousand men, who threw down\r\ntheir arms, were led off to the _Villa Publica_ in the Campus Martius,\r\nand there shut in; three days after soldiers were sent in who massacred\r\nthe whole; and when [Sulla] drew up his conscription list, he did not\r\nrest satisfied until he had destroyed, or driven from Italy, every one\r\nwho bore a Samnite name. To those who reproached him for this animosity,\r\nhe replied that he had learned by experience that not a single Roman\r\ncould rest in peace so long as any of the Samnites survived. Thus their\r\ncities have now dwindled into villages, some indeed being entirely\r\ndeserted, as Boianum,[2034] Æsernia,[2035] Panna, Telesia[2036]\r\nadjoining Venafrum, and others similar, none of which can be looked upon\r\nas cities; but in a country so renowned and powerful as Italy, we\r\nthought proper to mention places even of second-rate importance. [We\r\nshould add that] Beneventum[2037] and Venusia[2038] are still\r\nprosperous.\r\n\r\n12. The following is the tradition concerning the [origin of the]\r\nSamnites. The Sabines having been engaged for [CAS. 250] a long period\r\nin war with the Ombrici, made a vow, common with some of the Grecian\r\nnations, that they would consecrate to the gods the productions of the\r\nyear.[2039] They were victorious, and accordingly of the\r\nproductions,[2040] the one kind were sacrificed, the other consecrated.\r\nHowever, in a time of scarcity, some one remarked, that they ought\r\nlikewise to have consecrated the children. This then they did, and the\r\nchildren born at that period were called the sons of Mars.[2041] When\r\nthese had grown up to manhood, they were sent forth, a bull leading the\r\nway, to found a colony. The bull lay down to rest in a place belonging\r\nto the Opici; a people dwelling in villages. These they drove out, and\r\nestablished themselves in the place. The bull, according to the\r\ndirection of the diviners, they sacrificed to Mars, who had given him to\r\nthem as a leader. It seems to have been in allusion to this that their\r\nparents called them by the diminutive form of Sabelli.[2042] The name of\r\nSamnites, or, as the Greeks call them, Saunites, originated in another\r\ncause. It is also said that certain Lacedæmonians came to dwell amongst\r\nthem, and that this is the reason of their affection for the Greeks, and\r\nthat certain of them are called Pitanatæ.[2043] The whole of this,\r\nhowever, appears to be a mere fabrication of the Tarentini, interested\r\nin flattering and conciliating to themselves a neighbouring people, so\r\npowerful as to be able, on a time, to bring into the field a force of\r\neighty thousand foot-soldiers, and eight thousand cavalry. There is said\r\nto be a law amongst the Samnites, excellent in itself, and calculated to\r\nexcite to virtue. It is not lawful for fathers to give away their\r\ndaughters to whomsoever they may please; but every year ten of the most\r\nvirtuous young women, and ten of the most virtuous young men, are\r\nselected; of these the most excellent young man is married to the most\r\nexcellent young woman, the second to the second, and so on in order.\r\nShould he who receives this reward, afterwards change and become wicked,\r\nhe is dishonoured, and the wife who had been given is taken away from\r\nhim. Beyond are the Hirpini, who are also Samnites: their name they take\r\nfrom the wolf, which conducted their colony; a wolf being called by the\r\nSamnites _hirpos_: these people border on the Leucani in the interior.\r\nSo much for the Samnites.\r\n\r\n13. The fertility of their country has been productive to the Campanians\r\nof as much evil as good. Their luxury ran to such a height, that they\r\nwould invite to supper, in order to exhibit pairs of fighting\r\ngladiators, the exact number of pairs being regulated according to the\r\ndistinction of the guests. When, on their voluntary submission to\r\nHannibal, they received his soldiers into winter quarters,[2044] the\r\npleasures [of the place] rendered the men so effeminate, that Hannibal\r\nsaid, although conqueror, that he was in danger of the enemy, since his\r\nsoldiers were returned to him women, and no longer men. When the Romans\r\nobtained the mastery,[2045] they inflicted on them numerous ills, and\r\nended by distributing their land by lot.[2046] At the present day they\r\nare living in prosperity, and on friendly terms with the [Roman]\r\ncolonists, and preserve their ancient reputation, both in respect to the\r\nsize of their city and the numbers of their population. Beyond Campania\r\nand the Samnites,[2047] and upon the Tyrrhenian Sea, dwells the nation\r\nof the Picentini. This is a small off-shoot from the Picentini who dwell\r\nnear the Adriatic, and was transplanted by the Romans to the Posidoniate\r\nGulf,[2048] now called the Gulf of Pæstum. The city of Posidonia, which\r\nis built about the middle of the gulf, is called Pæstum.[2049] The\r\nSybarites [when they founded the city[2050]] built the fortifications\r\nclose upon the sea, but the inhabitants removed higher up. In after\r\ntime[2051] the Leucani seized upon the city, but in their turn were\r\ndeprived of it by the Romans.[2052] It is rendered unhealthy by a\r\nriver[2053] [CAS. 251] which overflows the marshy districts in the\r\nneighbourhood. Between the Sirenussæ and Posidonia[2054] is\r\nMarcina,[2055] a city founded by the Tyrrheni, but inhabited by the\r\nSamnites. [To go] from thence into Pompæa,[2056] through Nuceria,[2057]\r\n[you cross] an isthmus of not more than 120 stadia. The Picentes extend\r\nas far as the river Silaro,[2058] which separates their country on this\r\nside from ancient Leucania.[2059] The water of this river is reported to\r\npossess the singular property of petrifying any plant thrown into it,\r\npreserving at the same time both the colour and form.[2060] Picentia was\r\nformerly the capital of the Picentes; but they now dwell in villages,\r\nhaving been ejected by the Romans[2061] for taking part with Hannibal.\r\nAlso, instead of doing military service, it has been decreed that they\r\nshall be the public daily couriers and letter-carriers; [a penalty]\r\nwhich for the same cause has been likewise inflicted on the Leucani and\r\nBruttii. To keep them in check, the Romans fortified Salernum, which is\r\na little above the sea. The distance from the Sirenussæ to the Silaro is\r\n260 stadia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Sixth Book contains the remainder of Italy, and the regions\r\n   within the Adriatic, as far as Macedonia; likewise a description\r\n   of Apulia, Calabria, the country by the Ionian Gulf, together\r\n   with the adjacent islands, from Sicily to the Ceraunian\r\n   mountains, and on the other side as far as Carthage, and the\r\n   small islands lying near to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After the mouth of the Silaro,[2062] is Leucania, and the temple of\r\nArgive Juno, founded by Jason. Near to this, within 50 stadia, is\r\nPosidonia.[2063] Sailing thence, towards the high sea, is the island of\r\nLeucosia,[2064] at a little distance from the mainland. It bears the\r\nname of one of the Sirens, who according to the mythology was cast up\r\nhere, after having been precipitated with her companions into the deep.\r\nThe promontory[2065] of the island projects opposite the\r\nSirenussæ,[2066] forming the bay of Posidonium.[2067] After having made\r\nthis cape there is another contiguous bay, on which is built the city\r\nwhich the Phocæans called Hyela when they founded it, but others Ela\r\nfrom a certain fountain. People in the present day call it Elea. It is\r\nhere that Parmenides and Zeno, the Pythagorean philosophers, were born.\r\nAnd it is my opinion that through the instrumentality of those men, as\r\nwell as by previous good management, the government of that place was\r\nwell arranged, so that they successfully resisted the Leucani and the\r\nPosidoniatæ, notwithstanding the smallness of their district and the\r\ninferiority of their numbers. They are [CAS. 252] compelled, therefore,\r\non account of the barrenness of the soil, to apply to maritime trade\r\nchiefly, to employ themselves in the salting of fish, and in such other\r\noccupations. Antiochus[2068] says that when Phocea was taken by\r\nHarpagus, the general of Cyrus, those who had the means embarked with\r\ntheir families, and sailed under the conduct of Creontiades, first to\r\nCyrnos and Marseilles, but having been driven thence, they founded\r\nElea;[2069] the name of which some say is derived from the river\r\nElees.[2070] The city is distant about two hundred stadia from\r\nPosidonia. After this city is the promontory of Palinurus. But in front\r\nof the Eleatis are the Œnotrides, two islands[2071] having good\r\nanchorage.[2072] And beyond Palinurus are the promontory, harbour, and\r\nriver of Pyxus;[2073] the three having the same name. This colony was\r\nfounded[2074] by Micythus, then governor of Messina in Sicily; but those\r\nwho were located here, except a few, abandoned the place. After Pyxus\r\nare the gulf,[2075] the river,[2076] and the city[2077] of Laüs. This,\r\nthe last[2078] city of the Leucani, situate a little above the sea, is a\r\ncolony[2079] of the Sybarites, and is distant from Elea 400 stadia. The\r\nwhole circuit of Leucania, by sea is 650 stadia. Near to Laüs is seen\r\nthe tomb of Draco, one of the companions of Ulysses, and the oracular\r\nresponse, given to the Italian Greeks, alludes to him:\r\n\r\n   “Some day, around the Dragon’s stony tomb,\r\n   A mighty multitude shall meet their doom.”\r\n\r\nFor the Greeks of Italy, enticed by this prophecy, marched against Laüs\r\nand were defeated by the Leucani.[2080]\r\n\r\n2. Such, along the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea, are the possessions of\r\nthe Leucani, which at first did not reach to the other sea;[2081] the\r\nGreeks who dwelt on the Gulf of Tarentum possessed it. But before the\r\ncoming of the Greeks there were no Leucani, the Chones[2082] and Œnotri\r\npossessed these territories. But when the Samnites had greatly\r\nincreased, and expelled the Chones and Œnotri, and driven the Leucani\r\ninto this region, while the Greeks possessed the sea-coast on both\r\nsides as far as the straits, the Greeks and the Barbarians maintained a\r\nlengthened contest. The tyrants of Sicily, and afterwards the\r\nCarthaginians, at one time making war against the Romans, for the\r\nacquisition of Sicily, and at another, for Italy itself, utterly wasted\r\nall these regions. The Greeks, however, succeeded in depriving the\r\nancient inhabitants of a great portion of the midland country, beginning\r\neven as early as the Trojan war; they increased in power, and extent of\r\nterritory, to such a degree, that they called this region and Sicily,\r\nthe _Magna Græcia_. But now the whole region, except Tarentum, Rhegium,\r\nand Neapolis, has become barbarian,[2083] and belongs partly to the\r\nLeucani and Bruttii, partly to the Campani; to these, however, only in\r\nname, but truly to the Romans; for these people have become Roman.\r\nHowever, it is incumbent on one who is treating of [CAS. 253] universal\r\ngeography, to speak both of things as they now are, and of some of those\r\nthat have been, and especially when they are important. Of the Leucani,\r\nwho border upon the Tuscan Sea, mention has already been made; those who\r\npossess the midland regions dwell above the Gulf of Tarentum, but these,\r\nas well as the Bruttii, and the Samnites themselves, the progenitors of\r\nboth, have been so maltreated [by the Romans], that it is difficult to\r\ndetermine the boundaries of each people. The reason of this is, that\r\nthere no longer remains separately any of the institutions common to\r\nthese nations; and their peculiarities of language, of military and\r\ncivil costume, and such particulars, have passed away; besides, even\r\ntheir places of abode, considered separately and apart, possess nothing\r\nworthy of observation.\r\n\r\n3. We will narrate in a general manner what we have gathered concerning\r\nthe Leucani, who dwell in the interior, without too much care in\r\ndistinguishing them from their neighbours, the Samnites. Petilia[2084]\r\nis considered as the metropolis of the Leucani, and is still well\r\npeopled. It owes its foundation to Philoctetes, who was compelled to\r\nquit Melibœa on account of civil dissensions. Its position is so strong,\r\nthat the Samnites were formerly obliged to construct forts around it for\r\nthe defence of their territory. The ancient Crimissa, situated near\r\nthese places, was also founded by Philoctetes. Apollodorus, in his\r\ndescription of the ships [of the Greeks], narrates concerning\r\nPhiloctetes, that, according to certain writers, this prince having\r\ndisembarked in the district of Crotona, settled on the promontory of\r\nCrimissa, and built the city of Chone[2085] above it, from which the\r\ninhabitants were called Chones; and that certain colonists being sent by\r\nhim into Sicily, to the neighbourhood of Eryx,[2086] with Ægestus the\r\nTrojan, founded Ægesta.[2087] In the inland districts are also\r\nGrumentum,[2088] Vertinæ,[2089] Calasarna,[2090] and other small\r\nvillages, reaching as far as Venusia,[2091] a city of some importance.\r\nThis, however, I consider to be a Samnite city, as are also those which\r\nare next met with on going into Campania. Above the Thurii lies the\r\ndistrict called Tauriana.[2092] The Leucani are of Samnite origin.\r\nHaving vanquished the Posidoniates and their allies, they took\r\npossession of their cities. At one time the institutions of the Leucani\r\nwere democratic, but during the wars a king was elected by those who\r\nwere possessed of chief authority: at the present time they are Roman.\r\n\r\n4. The Bruttii occupy the remainder of the coast as far as the Strait of\r\nSicily, extending about 1350 stadia. Antiochus, in his treatise on\r\nItaly, says that this district, which he intended to describe, was\r\ncalled Italy, but that previously it had been called Œnotria. The\r\nboundary which he assigns to it on the Tyrrhenian Sea, is the river\r\nLao,[2093] and on the Sea of Sicily Metapontium, the former of which we\r\nhave given as the boundary of the Bruttii. He describes Tarentum, which\r\nis next to Metapontium,[2094] as beyond Italy, calling it Iapygian. He\r\nalso relates that, at a more ancient period, those who dwelt on this\r\nside the isthmus, which lies next the Strait of Sicily, were the only\r\npeople who were called Œnotrians and Italians. The isthmus is 160 stadia\r\nacross between the two gulfs, namely, that of Hipponium,[2095] which\r\nAntiochus called Napitinus, and [CAS. 255] that of Scylletium.[2096] The\r\ncircumnavigation of the peninsula, which is comprised between this\r\nisthmus and the strait, is 2000 stadia. He says that afterwards the\r\nnames of Italy and of the Œnotrians were extended as far as Metapontium\r\nand the Siritis; the Chones, a people of Œnotrian descent, and highly\r\ncivilized, inhabited these districts, and called their country Chone.\r\nHowever, this author has written in a very loose and old-fashioned\r\nmanner, without giving any definite boundaries to the Leucani and\r\nBruttii. Now Leucania is situated on the Tyrrhenian and Sicilian Seas,\r\nextending on one coast from the Silaro[2097] to the river Lao, and on\r\nthe other from Metapontium[2098] to Thurii. Along the continent it\r\nstretches from the country of the Samnites, as far as the isthmus\r\nbetween Thurii and Cerilli,[2099] near the Lao. This isthmus is 300\r\nstadia[2100] across. Beyond are the Bruttii, who dwell on the peninsula;\r\nin this is included another peninsula, which is bounded by the isthmus\r\nbetween Scylletium[2101] and the Hipponiate gulf.[2102] The nation\r\nreceived its appellation from the Leucani, for they call runaways\r\nBruttii, and they say that formerly they ran away from them when\r\nemployed as shepherds, and that afterwards their independence was\r\nestablished through the weakness [of the Leucani], when Dion [of\r\nSyracuse] was prosecuting a war against [the younger] Dionysius, and\r\nfomented hostilities amongst all.[2103] This is all we shall remark as\r\nto the Leucani and Bruttii.\r\n\r\n5. From the Lao the first city is the Temesa[2104] of the Bruttii,\r\nwhich at present is called Tempsa. It was founded by the Ausonians;\r\nafterwards the Ætolians, under the command of Thoas, gained possession\r\nof it. These were expelled by the Bruttii; Hannibal and the Romans have\r\noverthrown the Bruttii.[2105] In the vicinity of Temesa is the Heroum of\r\nPolites, one of the companions of Ulysses. It is surrounded by a thick\r\ngrove of wild olives. He was treacherously slain by the barbarians, and\r\nbecame in consequence very wrathful, and his shade so tormented the\r\ninhabitants that they submitted to pay him a tribute, according to the\r\ndirection of a certain oracle. Thus it became a proverb amongst them,\r\n“Let no one offend the hero of Temesa,” for they said that [for a long\r\ntime he[2106]] had tormented them. But when the Epizephyrian Locrians\r\ntook the city, they feign that Euthymus the pugilist went out against\r\nhim, and having overcome him in fight, constrained him to free the\r\ninhabitants from tribute.[2107] They say that the poet intended this\r\nTemesa, and not the Tamassus[2108] in Cyprus, (for it is said that the\r\nwords are suitable to either,[2109]) when he sings,\r\n\r\n                 “in quest of brass\r\n   To Temesa.”[2110]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 256] and certain copper-mines are pointed out near to the place,\r\nwhich are now exhausted. Contiguous to it is Terina,[2111] which\r\nHannibal destroyed, when he found he could no longer retain it; at the\r\ntime when he took refuge in the country of the Bruttii.[2112] Next in\r\norder comes Cosentia,[2113] the metropolis of the Bruttii. A little\r\nabove it is Pandosia, which is strongly fortified, before which\r\nAlexander the Molossian king was overthrown. This prince was led astray\r\nby the oracle of Dodona, which commanded him to avoid Acheron and\r\nPandosia;[2114] for places with names like these being pointed out in\r\nThesprotia, caused him to lose his life[2115] here. The position has\r\nthree summits, and the river Acheron flows by it. He was also mistaken\r\nin another oracle,\r\n\r\n   “O Pandosia, thou three-topp’d hill,\r\n   Hereafter many people thou shalt kill;”\r\n\r\nfor he thought that it foreshowed the destruction of his enemies, and\r\nnot of his own people. They say that Pandosia[2116] was formerly the\r\nresidence of the Œnotrian kings. After Cosentia is Hipponium,[2117]\r\nfounded by the Locrians.[2118] The Romans took it from the Bruttii, who\r\nwere in possession of it at a subsequent period, and changed the name\r\ninto Vibo-Valentia.[2119] And because the meadows in its vicinity are\r\nluxuriant and full of flowers, it is supposed that Proserpine came over\r\nfrom Sicily to gather them, and from thence the custom among women of\r\nthis city, to gather flowers and plait garlands, prevailed to such an\r\nextent, that they now think it shameful to wear purchased garlands at\r\nthe festivals.[2120] It also possesses a harbour[2121] made by\r\nAgathocles,[2122] the tyrant of Sicily, when he was in possession of the\r\ntown. On sailing hence to the Portus Herculis,[2123] we come to the\r\npoint where the headlands of Italy, as they stretch towards the Strait\r\n[of Sicily], begin to turn westward. In this voyage we pass Medma,[2124]\r\na city of the same Locrians,[2125] which bears the name of a copious\r\nfountain, and possessing at a short distance a naval station, called\r\nEmporium.[2126] Very nigh is the river Metauro,[2127] as also a naval\r\nstation bearing the same name.[2128] The Lipari Isles lie off this\r\ncoast; they are distant 200 stadia from the strait. They say that they\r\nare the islands of Æolus, of whom the poet makes [CAS. 257] mention in\r\nthe Odyssey.[2129] They are seven in number, and are all easily\r\ndistinguished both from Sicily and the coast of the continent about\r\nMedma. We will speak of them in particular when we describe Sicily.\r\nAfter the river Metaurus, there is another Metaurus.[2130] Next in order\r\nis Scyllæum, an elevated cliff nearly surrounded by the sea. But\r\nconnected with the mainland by a low isthmus easily accessible on either\r\nside, which Anaxilaus, the tyrant of Rhegium, fortified against the\r\nTyrrheni, and formed a commodious haven, and thus prevented the pirates\r\nfrom passing through the strait. Next to the Scyllæan promontory was\r\nthat of Cænys, distant from Medma 250 stadia. It is the last headland,\r\nand forms the narrowest part of the Strait [of Sicily], being opposite\r\nto Cape Pelorus on the Sicilian side, which is one of the three points\r\nwhich give to that island the form of a triangle. Its aspect is towards\r\nthe rising of the sun in summer, whilst that of Cænys looks towards the\r\nwest. Indeed they both seem to have diverged from the general line of\r\ncoast in order to stand out opposite each other.[2131] From Cænys to the\r\nPosidonium[2132] [and] the Columna Rheginorum,[2133] the narrow part of\r\nthe strait stretches as much as 6 stadia, the shortest passage across\r\nthe strait is a little more. From the Columna [Rheginorum] to Rhegium,\r\nwhere the strait begins to widen, is a hundred [stadia] as you advance\r\nin a direction towards the exterior and eastern sea, which is called the\r\nsea of Sicily.\r\n\r\n6. Rhegium[2134] was founded by certain Chalcidenses, who, as they say,\r\nwere decimated as an offering to Apollo in a time of scarcity, by order\r\nof an oracle, and afterwards removed hither from Delphi, taking with\r\nthem certain others from home. As Antiochus says, the Zanclæans sent for\r\nthe Chalcidenses, and appointed Antimnestus chief over them. Certain\r\nfugitives of the Messenians of Peloponnesus accompanied this colony, who\r\nhad been compelled to fly by those who refused to give satisfaction to\r\nthe Lacedæmonians for the violation[2135] of the virgins at Limnæ, whom\r\nthey had abused when attending the religious festival, and had slain\r\nthose who assisted them. However when the fugitives had removed to\r\nMacistus, they sent to the oracle complaining against Apollo and Diana\r\nfor suffering these things to happen notwithstanding they so greatly\r\nhonoured them, and inquiring how the devoted might be saved. Apollo\r\ncommanded to send them with the Chalcidenses to Rhegium, and to be\r\ngrateful, therefore, to his sister Diana for that they were not lost but\r\nsaved, as they should not be destroyed with their country, which would\r\nbe annihilated shortly after by the Spartans.[2136] They acted in\r\naccordance with the oracle, and thus it was that the rulers of the\r\nRhegini were all of Messenian race until the time of Anaxilaus.\r\n\r\nAntiochus asserts that anciently the whole of this district was\r\ninhabited by Sicilians and Morgetes; and that they [CAS. 258] afterwards\r\npassed into Sicily when they were expelled by the Œnotri. Some say that\r\nMorgantium[2137] thus received its name from the Morgetes. But the city\r\nof the Rhegini became very powerful, and possessed many dependent\r\nsettlements. It has always been a bulwark for us against the island [of\r\nSicily], and, indeed, has recently served to that purpose when Sextus\r\nPompeius alienated Sicily.[2138] It was called Rhegium either, as\r\nÆschylus says, because of the convulsion which had taken place in this\r\nregion; for Sicily was broken from the continent by earthquakes,\r\n\r\n   “Whence it is called Rhegium.”[2139]\r\n\r\nOthers,[2140] as well as he, have affirmed the same thing, and adduce as\r\nan evidence that which is observed about Ætna, and the appearances seen\r\nin other parts of Sicily, the Lipari and neighbouring islands, and even\r\nin the Pithecussæ, with the whole coast beyond them, which prove that it\r\nwas not unlikely that this convulsion had taken place. But now these\r\nmouths being opened, through which the fire is drawn up, and the ardent\r\nmasses and water poured out, they say that the land in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Strait of Sicily rarely suffers from the effects of earthquakes;\r\nbut formerly all the passages to the surface being blocked up, the fire\r\nwhich was smouldering beneath the earth, together with the vapour,\r\noccasioned terrible earthquakes, and the regions, being disturbed by the\r\nforce of the pent-up winds, sometimes gave way, and being rent received\r\nthe sea, which flowed in from either side; and thus were formed both\r\nthis strait and the sea which surrounds the other islands in the\r\nneighbourhood. For Prochyta[2141] and the Pithecussæ, as well as\r\nCapreæ, Leucosia, the Sirenes, and the Œnotrides, are but so many\r\ndetached fragments from the continent, but other islands have risen from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, a circumstance which frequently occurs in many\r\nplaces; for it is more reasonable to think that the islands in the midst\r\nof the sea have been raised up from the bottom, and that those which lie\r\noff headlands and are separated merely by a strait were broken off from\r\nthem. Still it is beside our purpose to investigate thoroughly whether\r\nthe name were given to the city for these causes, or whether it were\r\nnamed by the Samnites from the Latin word regium, which signifies royal,\r\non account of its importance,[2142] for their chieftains participated in\r\nthe privileges of citizenship with the Romans, and generally used the\r\nLatin language. But Dionysius (the elder), having been treated with\r\ncontempt by them, destroyed the illustrious city which had founded many\r\ntowns and produced many distinguished characters, whether statesmen or\r\nmen of letters,[2143] for when he sought a consort from their city, they\r\noffered him the hangman’s daughter;[2144] but his son (Dionysius the\r\nyounger) partly restored it,[2145] and called it Phœbia. During the war\r\nwith Pyrrhus, a body of Campanians destroyed most of the citizens\r\nagainst the faith of treaties,[2146] and a little [CAS. 259] before the\r\nMarsic or social war, earthquakes destroyed most of the towns;[2147] but\r\nafter Augustus Cæsar had driven Sextus Pompeius out of Sicily, when he\r\nsaw that the city was deficient of inhabitants, he appointed certain of\r\nthose who accompanied the expedition to reside there, and it is now\r\ntolerably well peopled.[2148]\r\n\r\n7. Sailing 50 stadia from Rhegium towards the east, we meet the cape\r\ncalled Leucopetra, from the colour of the rock, where they say the range\r\nof the Apennines terminates.[2149] Further on is Heraclæum.[2150] It is\r\nthe last promontory, and looks towards the south; for presently on\r\ndoubling it the course takes a south-western direction as far as the\r\npromontory of Iapygia,[2151] then it runs towards the north more and\r\nmore, and towards the west along the Ionian gulf. After the Herculeum\r\nPromontorium is the headland of Locris, which is called\r\nZephyrium,[2152] possessing a haven exposed to the west winds, whence is\r\nderived its name. Then is the state of the Locri Epizephyrii, a colony\r\nof Locrians transported by Evanthes from the Crissæan gulf, shortly\r\nafter the foundation of Crotona and Syracuse.[2153] Ephorus was not\r\ncorrect in stating that they were a colony of the Locri Opuntii.[2154]\r\nThey remained at first during three or four years at Cape Zephyrium;\r\nafterwards they removed their city, with the assistance of certain\r\nSyracusans who dwelt amongst them. There is also a fountain called\r\nLocria in the place where the Locri first took up their abode. From\r\nRhegium to the Locri there are 600 stadia. The city is built on a\r\nheight, which they call Esopis.[2155]\r\n\r\n8. The Locri are believed to have been the first who committed their\r\nlaws to writing, but after they had enjoyed the advantage of these good\r\nlaws for a very considerable time, Dionysius [the younger], having been\r\nexpelled[2156] from Syracuse, found means to abuse them in a most\r\nabominable manner, for he, entering into a private chamber where certain\r\nyoung brides had been adorned for their nuptials, violated them; he also\r\ngathered the most beautiful virgins to his revels, and having liberated\r\ndoves with uncut wings, commanded the young women to chase them round\r\nthe apartment in a state of perfect nudity, while on some he bound\r\nsandals of unequal height, one being high and the other low, in order to\r\nmake their appearance in the pursuit the more unseemly. However he paid\r\ndearly for this, for having returned to Sicily to resume his government,\r\nthe Locri overpowered the guard he had left in their city, freed\r\nthemselves, and obtained possession of his wife and children; there were\r\ntwo of his daughters, and his second son who had already attained the\r\nage of manhood; the eldest, however, called Apollocrates, accompanied\r\nhis father in the expedition. And although Dionysius himself entreated\r\nthem earnestly, as did also the Tarentines, to deliver the prisoners for\r\nwhatever ransom they should name, they remained inexorable, and endured\r\na siege and the wasting of their country, that they might vent their\r\nrage on his daughters. After having exposed them to the most shameful\r\n[CAS. 260] outrages, they strangled them, burnt their bodies, pounded\r\ntheir bones, and cast them into the sea.[2157] Ephorus in speaking of\r\nthe written law of the Locri, which Zaleucus had most judiciously\r\nselected from the Cretan, Lacedæmonian, and Areopagite codes, says that\r\nZaleucus was the first to establish this principle, that whereas\r\nformerly lawgivers had left it to the judges to award the punishments\r\nfor the several offences, he established a certain penalty in his laws,\r\nthinking that the minds of the judges would not be led to attach the\r\nsame penalties for the same transgressions, which course he considered\r\nexpedient. He praises him also for having simplified the law of\r\ncontracts. [He says also] that the Thurians, being desirous to improve\r\n[the code of Zaleucus] more than the Locri had done, became more\r\ncelebrated, but were less judicious.[2158] For that state is not\r\nregulated by the best government, where they guard against all manner of\r\ndeceit by their laws, but that wherein they abide by laws simply framed.\r\nPlato also has observed that where there are many laws, there will be\r\nlaw-suits and evil lives, in the same way as, where there are many\r\nphysicians, there it is likely there is much sickness.\r\n\r\n9. There is a certain singular circumstance, respecting grasshoppers,\r\nworthy of note. The river Alece[2159] divides Rhegium from Locris,\r\nflowing through a deep ravine; those which are in the territory of the\r\nLocrians sing, but those on the other side are silent; and it is thought\r\nprobable that this is caused by the region being woody, and their\r\nmembranes being softened by dew do not produce sound; but those on the\r\nLocrian side being sunned, are dry and horny, so that the sound is\r\neasily produced by them. The statue of Eunomus the harper having a\r\ngrasshopper seated on his harp is shown at Locri. Timæus says, that this\r\nEunomus was once contending at the Pythian games and disputed with\r\nAristo of Rhegium for the prize, and that Aristo declared that the\r\npeople of Delphi ought to take part with him, because his ancestors\r\nwere consecrated to the god, and sent out to found the colony; but\r\nEunomus said that they could have no claim to contend for melody with\r\nany one, because that among them even the grasshoppers, who are the most\r\ngifted of all creatures, were mute. Nevertheless Aristo was applauded,\r\nand had hopes of obtaining the victory, but Eunomus was declared\r\nvictorious, and dedicated the said statue in his country, because that\r\nat the contest one of the chords of his harp having broken, a\r\ngrasshopper taking his stand on it supplied the sound. Above these towns\r\nthe Bruttii possess the interior, and there is the city Mamertium,[2160]\r\nand the forest which they call Sila, which produces the best or Bruttian\r\npitch.[2161] It yields fine trees, and is well watered, extending over a\r\nlength of 700 stadia.\r\n\r\n10. After the Locri is the [river] Sagras,[2162] in the feminine gender,\r\non which is situated the altar of the Dioscuri, near which ten thousand\r\nLocrians, with a small body of Rhegians gained a victory over 130,000\r\nCrotoniatæ, whence they say arose the proverb applied to incredulous\r\npeople, “It is more true than the victory of the Sagras.” Some people\r\nadd to the mysterious account, that it was announced the same day at the\r\nOlympic games to the people there assembled, and this speedy news was\r\nfound perfectly correct. They say that this mischance was so unfortunate\r\nan event to the Crotoniatæ, that after it they did not long remain as a\r\nnation, on account [CAS. 261] of the number of citizens who fell in the\r\nbattle. After the Sagras is Caulonia, which was at first called Aulonia,\r\nfrom the αὐλὼν, or valley, in which it was situated; but it is deserted,\r\nfor its former possessors were driven out by the barbarians,[2163] and\r\nhave taken refuge in Sicily, and there founded [another] Caulonia.[2164]\r\nAfter this is Scylletium,[2165] a colony of the Athenians, who set out\r\nunder Menestheus;[2166] it is now called Scylacium.[2167] Dionysius [the\r\nelder] allotted a portion of it to the Locri, whilst it was in the\r\npossession of the Crotoniatæ.[2168] The Scylleticus Sinus received its\r\nname from this city. It together with the Hipponiates Sinus forms the\r\nisthmus which we have mentioned above.[2169] Dionysius[2170] undertook\r\nto build a wall across the isthmus, at the time he was carrying on war\r\nagainst the Leucani, assigning as a pretext that it would afford\r\nsecurity to the inhabitants of the peninsula from the inroads of the\r\nbarbarians dwelling beyond it; but in truth his intention was to cut off\r\nthe communication of the Greeks with each other, and to have the greater\r\npower over those who dwelt within the peninsula, but those who dwelt\r\nwithout[2171] assembled and prevented the undertaking.\r\n\r\n11. After Scylletium is the region of Crotona, and the Iapygum tria\r\nPromontoria,[2172] and after these the Lacinium,[2173] sacred to Juno,\r\nformerly rich and filled with many offerings. But the distances have not\r\nbeen accurately stated. We can only say that in a general way Polybius\r\nreckons 2300[2174] stadia from the strait[2175] to Lacinium,[2176] and\r\n700 stadia from Lacinium to the Iapygian promontory. They call this the\r\nentrance of the Gulf of Taranto. The extent of the gulf is considerable,\r\nbeing 240 miles along the shore. As the chorographer says ... of 380 ...\r\nto a light person, Artemidorus: wanting also by so many ... of the\r\nbreadth of the mouth of the gulf.[2177] Its aspect looks towards the\r\nrising of the sun in winter.[2178] It commenced from Lacinium, for\r\npresently on doubling the cape you come to where the Greek cities\r\nformerly stood; now they no longer exist, with the exception of\r\nTarentum. But on account of the estimation in which certain of them were\r\nheld, it is worth while to speak of them somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\n12. The first is Crotona, 150 stadia from Lacinium and the river [CAS.\r\n262] Esaro;[2179] there is also a haven[2180] there, and another river\r\nNieto,[2181] the name whereof is said to be derived from the following\r\ncircumstance—they say that certain of the Greeks who had wandered from\r\nthe fleet which had besieged Troy, having arrived in this place,\r\ndisembarked to take a survey of the country, and that the Trojan women\r\nwho accompanied them in the fleet, having observed the absence of the\r\nmen, and being wearied with a toilsome voyage, set fire to the fleet, so\r\nthat they were compelled to abide, when they saw, in addition [to the\r\nloss of their ships], that the soil was very fertile. Many others\r\narriving soon after, and being desirous to live near their\r\nfellow-countrymen, founded several settlements. Most of them derived\r\ntheir names from the Trojans, and the river Nieto received its\r\nappellation from the destruction[2182] [of the ships]. But Antiochus\r\nrelates that an oracle having commanded the Greeks to found Crotona,\r\nMyscellus went forth to view the place, and having seen Sybaris already\r\nbuilt on a neighbouring river of the same name, thought it better, and\r\nreturned to the god to ask if he might be permitted to settle in that,\r\ninstead of the other; but that the oracle answered, applying to him an\r\nepithet noticing his defective stature, (for Myscellus was somewhat\r\ncrook-backed,)\r\n\r\n   “O short-backed Myscellus, whilst seeking somewhat else of thyself,\r\n   Thou pursuest only misfortune: it is right to accept that which is\r\n     proffered to thee:”[2183]\r\n\r\nand that he returned and built Crotona, wherein he was assisted by\r\nArchias,[2184] the founder of Syracuse, who happened to touch at Crotona\r\nby chance, as he was proceeding to the colony of the Syracusans. The\r\nIapyges possessed Crotona before this time,[2185] as Ephorus relates.\r\nThe city cultivated martial discipline and athletic exercises to a\r\ngreat extent, and in one of the Olympic games all the seven wrestlers,\r\nwho obtained the palm in the stadium, were Crotoniatæ; whence, it seems,\r\nthe saying arose that the last wrestler of Crotona was the first of the\r\nother Greeks, and hence they say also is the origin of the expression,\r\n“more salubrious than Crotona,” as instancing a place which had\r\nsomething to show, in the number of wrestlers which it produced, as a\r\nproof of its salubrity and the robust frame of body which it was capable\r\nof rearing. Thus it had many victors in the Olympic games, although it\r\ncannot be reckoned to have been long inhabited on account of the vast\r\ndestruction of its citizens, who fell at the battle of the Sagras. Its\r\ncelebrity too was not a little spread by the number of Pythagoreans who\r\nresided there, and Milo,[2186] who was the most renowned of wrestlers,\r\nand lived in terms of intimacy with Pythagoras, who abode long in this\r\ncity. They relate that at a banquet of the philosophers, when one of the\r\npillars in the hall gave way, Milo sustained the ceiling while they all\r\nescaped, and afterwards saved himself. It is likely that, trusting to\r\nthe same strength, he met his fate as related by some, for whilst making\r\nhis way through a thick wood, he strayed considerably out of the path,\r\nwhen finding a great log with wedges in it, he thrust both his hands and\r\nfeet into the fissure, intending to split it completely, but was only\r\nable to force it enough to let the wedges fall out, when the gaping log\r\npresently closed on him, and he, being taken as in a snare, was devoured\r\nby wild beasts.\r\n\r\n13. Beyond this, at the distance of 200 stadia, is situated\r\nSybaris,[2187] a colony settled by the Achæans, between the two [CAS.\r\n263] rivers Crati[2188] and Sybaris.[2189] Its founder was Is....[2190]\r\nthe Helicean.[2191] So great was the prosperity enjoyed by this city\r\nanciently, that it held dominion over four neighbouring people and\r\ntwenty-five towns; in the war with the Crotoniatæ it brought into the\r\nfield 300,000 men, and occupied a circuit of 50 stadia on the Crati. But\r\non account of the arrogance and turbulence of its citizens, it was\r\ndeprived of all its prosperity by the Crotoniatæ in 70[2192] days, who\r\ntook the city, and turning the waters of the river [Crati], overwhelmed\r\nit with an inundation.[2193] Some time after, a few who had escaped came\r\ntogether and inhabited the site of their former city, but in time they\r\nwere dispossessed by the Athenians[2194] and other Greeks, who came and\r\nsettled amongst them, but they despised and subjugated them, and removed\r\nthe city to a neighbouring place, calling its name Thurii, from a\r\nfountain of that name. The water of the river Sybaris has the peculiar\r\nproperty of making the horses which drink it shy,[2195] for which reason\r\nthey keep their horses away from the river. The Crati turns the hair of\r\nthose who bathe in it yellow, and sometimes white, but has been found\r\nsalutary for the cure of many disorders. Thurii, after having flourished\r\nfor a long time, became a continual prey to the aggressions of the\r\nLeucani,[2196] and afterwards the Tarentini troubling them, they\r\nappealed to the Romans for succour, who, in course of time, sent a\r\ncolony[2197] when it was nearly deserted, and changed the name of the\r\ncity to Copiæ.[2198]\r\n\r\n14. After Thurii is Lagaria,[2199] a garrison fort; it was originally\r\nsettled by Epeius[2200] and the Phocenses; hence is derived the\r\nLagaritan wine, sweet and delicate, and much recommended by the\r\nphysicians, as is likewise the Thurian wine, which is reckoned among the\r\nbest. Then comes the city of Heraclea,[2201] a little way from the sea,\r\nand two navigable rivers, the Agri[2202] and the Sinno,[2203] on which\r\nwas the city Siris, founded by a Trojan colony, but in course of time,\r\nwhen Heraclea was peopled with the citizens of Siris by the Tarentini,\r\nit became the harbour of Heraclea. Its distance from Heraclea was 24\r\nstadia, and from Thurii about 330.[2204] They point out the statue of\r\nthe Trojan Minerva, which is erected there, as a proof of its\r\ncolonization by the Trojans. They also relate as a miracle how the\r\nstatue closed its eyes when the suppliants, who had fled for sanctuary\r\nto her shrine, were dragged away by the Ionians after they had taken the\r\ncity;[2205] they say that these Ionians came to settle here, when they\r\nfled from the yoke of the Lydians, and took the town of the\r\nTrojans[2206] by force, calling its name Polieum. They show, too, at the\r\npresent time [CAS. 264] the statue that closes its eyes. It must,\r\nhowever, require a good courage, not to assert that it appeared to have\r\nclosed its eyes, as that at Troy turned away its eyes from beholding the\r\nviolence offered to Cassandra, but to show it in the act of winking:—but\r\nit is much more daring to make so many statues of the Minerva rescued\r\nfrom Ilium, as those who describe them affirm, for there is a Minerva\r\nsaid to be Trojan in the sense of having been rescued from that city,\r\nnot only at Siris, but at Rome, at Lavinium, and at Luceria. The scene,\r\ntoo, of the daring of the Trojan female captives is assigned to many\r\ndifferent places and appears incredible, although it is by no means\r\nimpossible. There are some who say that Siris, and also that Sybaris on\r\nthe Trionto,[2207] were founded by the Rhodians. Antiochus says that the\r\nsite of Siris having become the subject of a contention between the\r\nTarentini and the Thurii, on that occasion commanded by Cleandridas the\r\ngeneral who had been banished from Lacedæmon, the two people came to a\r\ncomposition, and agreed to inhabit it in common, but that the\r\ncolony[2208] should be considered as Tarentine; however, at a subsequent\r\nperiod both the name and the locality were changed, and it was called\r\nHeraclea.[2209]\r\n\r\n15. Next in order is Metapontium,[2210] at a distance of 140 stadia from\r\nthe sea-port of Heraclea. It is said to be a settlement of the Pylians\r\nat the time of their return from Ilium under Nestor; their success in\r\nagriculture was so great, that it is said they offered at Delphi a\r\ngolden harvest:[2211] they adduce, as a proof of this foundation, the\r\nofferings of the dead sacrificed periodically to the Neleïdæ;[2212] but\r\nit was destroyed by the Samnites.[2213] Antiochus says that certain\r\nAchæans, who had been sent for by the Achæans of Sybaris, settled in\r\nthis place when it had been desolated; he adds that these were sent for\r\non account of the hatred of the Achæans to the Tarentini, who had\r\noriginally migrated from Laconia, in order to prevent their seizing upon\r\nthe place which lay adjacent to them. Of the two cities, viz.\r\nMetapontium which was situated the nearer, [and Siris the\r\nfurther,[2214]] from Tarentum, the new comers preferred to occupy\r\nMetapontium. This choice was suggested by the Sybarites, because, if\r\nthey should make good their settlement there, they would also possess\r\nSiris, but if they were to turn to Siris, Metapontium would be annexed\r\nto the territory of the Tarentines which was conterminous. But after\r\nbeing engaged in war with the Tarentini and the Œnotrians, who dwelt\r\nbeyond them, they came to an agreement, securing to them a portion of\r\nland, which should constitute the boundary between Italy, as it then\r\nexisted, and Iapygia. This, too, is the locality which tradition assigns\r\nto the adventures of Metapontus and the captive Melanippe, and her son\r\nBœotus. But Antiochus is of opinion that the city Metapontium was\r\noriginally called Metabum, and that its name was altered at a subsequent\r\nperiod; and that Melanippe was not entertained here but at Dius, and\r\nthinks that the heroum of Metabus as well as the testimony of the poet\r\nAsius, who says that\r\n\r\n   “The beautiful Melanippe, in the halls of Dius, bare Bœotus,”\r\n\r\nafford sufficient proof that Melanippe was led to Dius and not to\r\nMetabum. Ephorus says that Daulius, the tyrant of Crissa[2215] near\r\nDelphi, was the founder of Metapontium. There is, however, another\r\ntradition, that Leucippus was sent by the Achæans to help to found the\r\ncolony, and having asked permission of the Tarentini to have the place\r\nfor a day and a night, would not give it up, replying by day to those\r\nwho [CAS. 265] asked it of him, that he had asked and obtained it till\r\nthe following night, and when asked by night, he said that he held it\r\ntill the coming day.\r\n\r\nNext adjoining is Tarentum and Iapygia, which we will describe when we\r\nshall have first gone through the islands which lie off Italy, according\r\nto our original purpose; for we have always given the adjacent islands\r\nwith every nation we have hitherto described, and since we have gone\r\nthrough Œnotria, which only, the people of ancient times named Italy, we\r\nfeel justified in keeping to the same arrangement, and shall pass on to\r\nSicily and the surrounding islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sicily is triangular in form, and on this account was at first called\r\nTrinacria, but afterwards the name was softened and it was changed into\r\nThrinacia.[2216] Three low headlands bound the figure: Pelorias is the\r\nname of that towards Cænys and the Columna Rheginorum which forms the\r\nstrait; Pachynus[2217] is that which stretches towards the east, and is\r\nwashed by the Sea of Sicily, looking towards the Peloponnesus and in the\r\ndirection of the passage to Crete; the third is Lilybæum,[2218] and is\r\nnext to Africa, looking towards that region and the setting of the sun\r\nin winter.[2219] Of the sides which these three headlands bound, two are\r\nsomewhat concave, while the third is slightly convex, it runs from\r\nLilybæum to Pelorias, and is the longest, being, as Posidonius has said,\r\n1700 stadia adding further twenty. Of the others, that extending to\r\nPachynus from Lilybæum is the longer, while the shortest faces the\r\nStrait and Italy, extending from Pelorias to Pachynus, being about 1120\r\nor 1130 stadia. Posidonius shows that the circumference is 4400 stadia,\r\nbut in the Chorography the distances are declared to exceed the above\r\nnumbers, being severally reckoned in miles. Thus from Cape Pelorias to\r\nMylæ,[2220] 25 miles; from Mylæ to Tyndaris,[2221] 25; thence to\r\nAgathyrnum,[2222] 30; from Agathyrnum to Alæsa,[2223] 30; from Alæsa to\r\nCephalœdium,[2224] 30; these are but insignificant places; from\r\nCephalœdium to the river Himera,[2225] which runs through the midst of\r\nSicily, 18; from thence to Panormus,[2226] 35; [thence] to the\r\nEmporium[2227] of the Ægestani, 32; leaving to Lilybæum[2228] a distance\r\nof 38; thence having doubled the Cape and coasting the adjacent side to\r\nHeracleum,[2229] 75; and to the Emporium[2230] of the Agrigentini, 20;\r\nand to[2231] [CAS. 266] Camarina,[2232] another 20; then to Pachynus,\r\n50; thence again along the third side to Syracuse, 36;[2233] from\r\nSyracuse to Catana, 60; then to Tauromenium,[2234] 33; thence to\r\nMessana, 30.[2235] Thus on foot[2236] from Pachynus to Pelorias we have\r\n168 [miles], and from Messana[2237] to [Cape] Lilybæum, on the Via\r\nValeria,[2238] we have 235[2239] [miles]. Some have estimated the\r\ncircuit in a more simple way, as Ephorus, who says that the compass of\r\nthe island by sea takes five days and nights. Posidonius attempts to\r\ndetermine the situation of the island by climata,[2240] and places\r\nPelorias to the north, Lilybæum to the south, and Pachynus to the east.\r\nWe however consider that of necessity all climata are set out in the\r\nmanner of a parallelogram, but that districts portrayed as triangles,\r\nand especially such triangles as are scalene,[2241] and whereof no one\r\nside lies parallel to a side of the parallelogram, cannot in any way be\r\nassimilated to climata on account of their obliquity. However, we must\r\nallow, that in treating of Sicily, Pelorias, which lies to the south of\r\nItaly, may well be called the most northern of the three angles, so that\r\nwe say that the line which joins it[2242] to Pachynus faces the east but\r\nlooks towards the north.[2243] Now this line [of coast] will make the\r\nside next the Strait [of Messina], and it must have a slight inclination\r\ntowards the winter sunrise;[2244] for thus the shore slightly changes\r\nits direction as you travel from Catana towards Syracuse and Pachynus.\r\nNow the transit from Pachynus to the mouth of the Alpheus[2245] is 4000\r\nstadia. But when Artemidorus says that from Pachynus to Tænarum[2246] it\r\nis 4600, and from the Alpheus to the Pamisus is 1130 stadia,[2247] he\r\nappears to me to lie open to the objection of having given distances\r\nwhich do not accord with the 4000 stadia from Pachynus to the Alpheus.\r\nThe line run from Pachynus to Lilybæum (which is much to the west of\r\nPelorias) is considerably diverged from the south towards the west,\r\nhaving at the same time an aspect looking towards the east and towards\r\nthe south.[2248] On one side it is washed by the sea of Sicily, and on\r\nthe other by the Libyan Sea, extending from Carthage to the Syrtes. The\r\nshortest run is 1500 stadia from Lilybæum to the coast of Africa about\r\nCarthage; and, according to report, a certain very sharp-sighted\r\nperson,[2249] placed on a watch-tower, announced to the Carthaginians\r\nbesieged in Lilybæum the number of the ships which were leaving\r\nCarthage. And from Lilybæum to Pelorias the side must necessarily\r\nincline towards the east, and look in a direction towards the west and\r\nnorth, having Italy to the north, and the Tyrrhenian Sea with the\r\nislands of Æolus to the west.[2250]\r\n\r\n2. The cities situated on the side which forms the Strait are, first\r\nMessana, then Tauromenium,[2251] Catana, and Syracuse; between Catana\r\nand Syracuse were the ruined cities Naxos[2252] and Megara,[2253]\r\nsituated where the rivers descending from Ætna fall into the sea, and\r\nafford good accommodation for shipping. Here is also the promontory of\r\nXiphonia. They say that Ephorus founded these first cities of the Greeks\r\nin Sicily in [CAS. 267] the tenth generation from the Trojan war. For\r\nthose who preceded him were so terrified by the piratical customs of the\r\nTyrrheni, and the ferocity of the savages of the neighbourhood, that\r\nthey did not even venture to resort thither for the purposes of\r\ncommerce. Theocles the Athenian, however, having been driven to Sicily\r\nby storms, observed both the weakness of the inhabitants and the\r\nexcellence of the soil. On his return home, he was unable to persuade\r\nthe Athenians to make any attempt, but he collected a numerous band of\r\nChalcidians in Eubœa, with some Ionians and Dorians, whereof the most\r\npart were Megarenses, and sailed. The Chalcidians founded Naxos, and the\r\nDorians Megara, which was at first called Hybla. These cities no longer\r\nexist, but the name of Hybla survives on account of the Hyblæan honey.\r\n\r\n3. The first of the cities which at present remain on the aforesaid side\r\nis Messana, built at the head of the gulf of Pelorias, which is curved\r\nvery considerably towards the east, and forms a bay. The passage across\r\nto Rhegium[2254] is 60 stadia, but the distance to the Columna\r\nRheginorum is much less. It was from a colony of the Messenians of the\r\nPeloponnesus that it was named Messana, having been originally called\r\nZancle, on account of the great inequality of the coast (for anything\r\nirregular was termed ζάγκλιον).[2255] It was originally founded by the\r\npeople of Naxos near Catana. Afterwards the Mamertini, a tribe of\r\nCampanians, took possession of it.[2256] The Romans, in the war in\r\nSicily against the Carthaginians, used it as an arsenal.[2257] Still\r\nmore recently,[2258] Sextus Pompeius assembled his fleet in it, to\r\ncontend against Augustus Cæsar; and when he relinquished the island, he\r\ntook ship from thence.[2259] Charybdis[2260] is pointed out at a short\r\ndistance from the city in the Strait, an immense gulf, into which the\r\nback currents of the Strait frequently impel ships, carrying them down\r\nwith a whirl and the violence of the eddy. When they are swallowed down\r\nand shattered, the wrecks are cast by the stream on the shore of\r\nTauromenia,[2261] which they call, on account of this kind of\r\naccumulation, the dunghill.[2262] So greatly have the Mamertini\r\nprevailed over the Messenians, that they have by degrees wrested the\r\ncity from them. The inhabitants generally are rather called Mamertini\r\nthan Messenians. The district abounds in wine, which we do not call\r\nMessenian, but Mamertinian: it vies with the best produced in\r\nItaly.[2263] The city is well peopled, but Catana is more populous,\r\nwhich has been colonized by the Romans.[2264] Tauromenium is less\r\npopulous than either. Catana was founded by people from Naxos, and\r\nTauromenium by the Zanclæans of Hybla,[2265] but Catana was deprived of\r\nits original inhabitants when Hiero, the tyrant of Syracuse, introduced\r\nothers, and called it by the name of Ætna instead of Catana. It is of\r\nthis that Pindar says he was the founder, when he sings,\r\n\r\n   “Thou understandest what I say, O father, that bearest the same name\r\n   with the splendid holy sacrifices, thou founder of Ætna.”[2266]\r\n\r\nBut on the death of Hiero,[2267] the Catanæans returned and expelled the\r\nnew inhabitants, and demolished the mausoleum of the tyrant. The\r\nÆtnæans, compelled to retire,[2268] established themselves on a hilly\r\ndistrict of Ætna, called Innesa,[2269] and called the place Ætna. It is\r\ndistant from Catana about 80 stadia. They still acknowledged Hiero as\r\ntheir founder.\r\n\r\nÆtna lies the highest of any part of Catana, and participates the most\r\nin the inconveniences occasioned by the mouths of the volcano, for the\r\nstreams of lava flowing down in Catanæa[2270] pass through it first. It\r\nwas here that Amphinomus [CAS. 269] and Anapias set the example of\r\nfilial piety so greatly celebrated, for they, seizing their parents,\r\ncarried them on their shoulders[2271] to a place of safety from the\r\nimpending ruin; for whenever, as Posidonius relates, there is an\r\neruption of the mountain the fields of the Catanæans are buried to a\r\ngreat depth. However, after the burning ashes have occasioned a\r\ntemporary damage, they fertilize the country for future seasons, and\r\nrender the soil good for the vine and very strong for other produce, the\r\nneighbouring districts not being equally adapted to the produce of wine.\r\nThey say that the roots which the districts covered with these ashes\r\nproduce, are so good for fattening sheep, that they are sometimes\r\nsuffocated, wherefore they bleed them in the ear every four or five\r\ndays,[2272] in the same way as we have related a like practice at\r\nErythia. When the stream of lava cools[2273] it covers the surface of\r\nthe earth with stone to a considerable depth, so that those who wish to\r\nuncover the original surface are obliged to hew away the stone as in a\r\nquarry. For the stone is liquefied in the craters and then thrown up.\r\nThat which is cast forth from the top is like a black moist clay and\r\nflows down the hill-sides, then congealing it becomes mill-stone,\r\npreserving the same colour it had while fluid. The ashes of the stones\r\nwhich are burnt are like what would be produced by wood, and as rue\r\nthrives on wood ashes, so there is probably some quality in the ashes of\r\nÆtna which is appropriate to the vine.\r\n\r\n4. Archias, sailing from Corinth, founded Syracuse about the same\r\nperiod[2274] that Naxos and Megara were built. They say that Myscellus\r\nand Archias having repaired to Delphi at the same time to consult the\r\noracle, the god demanded whether they would choose wealth or health,\r\nwhen Archias preferred wealth and Myscellus health, upon which the\r\noracle assigned Syracuse to the former to found, and Crotona to the\r\nlatter. And certainly, in like manner as it fell out that the Crotoniatæ\r\nshould inhabit a state so notable for salubrity as we have\r\ndescribed,[2275] so such great riches have accrued to the Syracusans\r\nthat their name has been embodied in the proverb applied to those who\r\nhave too great wealth, viz. that they have not yet attained to a tithe\r\nof the riches of the Syracusans. While Archias was on his voyage to\r\nSicily, he left Chersicrates, a chief of the race of the\r\nHeracleidæ,[2276] with a part of the expedition to settle the island now\r\ncalled Corcyra,[2277] but anciently called Scheria, and he, having\r\nexpelled the Liburni who possessed it, established his colony in the\r\nisland. Archias, pursuing his route, met with certain Dorians at\r\nZephyrium,[2278] come from Sicily, and who had quitted the company of\r\nthose who had founded Megara; these he took with him, and in conjunction\r\nwith them founded Syracuse. The city flourished on account of the\r\nfertility[2279] of the country and the convenience of the harbours, the\r\ncitizens became great rulers; while under tyrants themselves, they\r\ndomineered over the other states [of Sicily], and when freed from\r\ndespotism, they set at liberty such as had been enslaved by the\r\nbarbarians: of these barbarians some were the aboriginal inhabitants of\r\nthe island, while others had come across from the continent. The Greeks\r\nsuffered none of the barbarians to approach the shore, although they\r\nwere not able to expel them entirely from the interior, for the Siculi,\r\nSicani,[2280] Morgetes, and some others,[2281] still inhabit the island\r\nto the present day, amongst whom also were the Iberians, who, as Ephorus\r\nrelates, were [CAS. 270] the first of the barbarians that are\r\nconsidered to have been settlers in Sicily. It seems probable that\r\nMorgantium[2282] was founded by the Morgetes. Formerly it was a city,\r\nbut now it is not. When the Carthaginians[2283] endeavoured to gain\r\npossession of the island they continually harassed both the Greeks and\r\nthe barbarians, but the Syracusans withstood them; at a later period\r\nthe Romans expelled the Carthaginians and took Syracuse after a long\r\nsiege.[2284] And [Sextus] Pompeius, having destroyed Syracuse in the\r\nsame way as he had done by the other cities,[2285] Augustus Cæsar in\r\nour own times sent thither a colony, and to a great extent restored\r\nit to its former importance, for anciently it consisted of five\r\ntowns[2286] enclosed by a wall of 180[2287] stadia, but there being\r\nno great need that it should fill this extensive circle, he thought\r\nit expedient to fortify in a better way the thickly inhabited portion\r\nlying next the island of Ortygia, the circumference of which by itself\r\nequals that of an important city. Ortygia is connected to the mainland\r\nby a bridge, and [boasts of] the fountain Arethusa, which springs in\r\nsuch abundance as to form a river at once, and flows into the sea. They\r\nsay that it is the river Alpheus[2288] which rises in the Peloponnesus,\r\nand that it flows through the land beneath the sea[2289] to the place\r\nwhere the Arethusa rises and flows into the sea. Some such proofs as\r\nthese are given in support of the fact. A certain chalice having fallen\r\ninto the river at Olympia was cast up by the springs of Arethusa; the\r\nfountain too is troubled by the sacrifices of oxen at Olympia. And\r\nPindar, following such reports, thus sings,\r\n\r\n   “Ortygia, revered place of reappearing[2290] of the Alpheus,\r\n   The offset of renowned Syracuse.”[2291]\r\n\r\nTimæus[2292] the historian advances these accounts in like manner with\r\nPindar. Undoubtedly if before reaching the sea the Alpheus were to fall\r\ninto some chasm,[2293] there would be a probability that it continued\r\nits course from thence to Sicily, preserving its potable water unmixed\r\nwith the sea; but since the mouth of the river manifestly falls into the\r\nsea, and there does not appear any opening in the bed of the sea there,\r\nwhich would be capable of imbibing the waters of the river, (although\r\neven if there were they could not remain perfectly fresh, still it might\r\nbe possible to retain much of the character of fresh water, if they were\r\npresently to be swallowed down into a passage running below the earth\r\nwhich forms the bed of the sea,) it is altogether impossible; and this\r\nthe water of Arethusa clearly proves, being perfectly fit for beverage;\r\nbut [CAS. 271] that the flow of the river should remain compact through\r\nso long a course, not mixing with the sea until it should fall into the\r\nfancied channel, is entirely visionary; for we can scarcely credit it of\r\nthe Rhone, the body of the waters of which remains compact during its\r\npassage through the lake, and preserves a visible course, but in that\r\ninstance both the distance is short and the lake is not agitated by\r\nwaves like the sea, but in this case of the Alpheus,[2294] where there\r\nare great storms and the waters are tossed with violence, the\r\nsupposition is by no means worthy of attention. The fable of the chalice\r\nbeing carried over is likewise a mere fabrication, for it is not\r\ncalculated for transfer, nor is it by any means probable it should be\r\nwashed away so far, nor yet by such difficult passages. Many rivers,\r\nhowever, and in many parts of the world, flow beneath the earth, but\r\nnone for so great a distance.—Still, although there may be no\r\nimpossibility in this circumstance, yet the above-mentioned accounts are\r\naltogether impossible, and almost as absurd as the fable related of the\r\nInachus: this river, as Sophocles[2295] feigns,\r\n\r\n   “Flowing from the heights of Pindus and Lacmus, passes from the\r\n   country of the Perrhœbi[2296] to that of the Amphilochi[2297] and\r\n   the Acarnanians, and mingles its waters with the Achelous:”[2298]\r\n\r\nand further on [he says],\r\n\r\n   “Thence to Argos, cutting through the waves, it comes to the\r\n   territory of Lyrceius.”\r\n\r\nThose who would have the river Inopus to be a branch of the Nile flowing\r\nto Delos, exaggerate this kind of marvel to the utmost. Zoïlus the\r\nrhetorician, in his Eulogium of the people of Tenedos, says that the\r\nriver Alpheus flows from Tenedos: yet this is the man who blames Homer\r\nfor fabulous writing. Ibycus also says that the Asopus, a river of\r\nSicyon,[2299] flows from Phrygia. Hecatæus is more rational, who says\r\nthat the Inachus of the Amphilochi, which flows from Mount Lacmus, from\r\nwhence also the Æas[2300] descends, was distinct from the river of like\r\nname in Argolis, and was so named after Amphilochus, from whom likewise\r\nthe city of Argos was denominated Amphilochian. He says further, that\r\nthis river falls into the Achelous, and that the Æas flows to\r\nApollonia[2301] towards the west. On each side of the island there is an\r\nextensive harbour; the extent of the larger one is 80[2302] stadia.\r\n[Augustus] Cæsar has not only restored this city, but Catana, and\r\nlikewise Centoripa,[2303] which had contributed much towards the\r\noverthrow of [Sextus] Pompey. Centoripa is situated above Catana and\r\nconfines with the mountains of Ætna and the river Giaretta,[2304] which\r\nflows into Catanæa.\r\n\r\n5. One of the remaining sides, that stretching from Pachynus to\r\nLilybæum, is entirely deserted; still it preserves a few traces of the\r\nancient inhabitants, one of whose cities was Camarina.[2305]\r\nAcragas,[2306] which was a colony of the Geloi,[2307] together with its\r\nport and Lilybæum,[2308] still exist. In fact, these regions, lying\r\nopposite to Carthage, have been wasted by the great and protracted wars\r\nwhich have been waged. The remaining and greatest side, although it is\r\nby no means densely peopled, is well occupied, for Alæsa,[2309]\r\nTyndaris,[2310] the emporium[2311] of the Ægestani and\r\nCephalœdium,[2312] are respectable towns. Panormus has received a Roman\r\ncolony: they say that Ægesta[2313] was founded by the Greeks who passed\r\nover, as we have related when speaking of Italy, with Philoctetes to the\r\nCrotoniatis, and were by him sent to Sicily with Ægestus[2314] the\r\nTrojan.\r\n\r\n6. In the interior of the island a few inhabitants possess Enna,[2315]\r\nin which there is a temple of Ceres;[2316] it is situated on [CAS. 272]\r\na hill, and surrounded by spacious tablelands well adapted for tillage.\r\nThe fugitive slaves, who placed themselves under the leading of\r\nEunus,[2317] and sustained in this city a long siege, scarcely being\r\nreduced by the Romans, occasioned much damage to the city. The Catanæi,\r\nTauromenitæ, and many others, suffered, much in like manner.\r\n†Eryx,[2318] a very lofty mountain, is also inhabited. It possesses a\r\ntemple of Venus, which is very much esteemed; in former times it was\r\nwell filled with women sacred to the goddess, whom the inhabitants of\r\nSicily, and also many others, offered in accomplishment of their vows;\r\nbut now, both is the neighbourhood much thinner of inhabitants, and the\r\ntemple not near so well supplied with priestesses and female\r\nattendants.[2319] There is also an establishment of this goddess at Rome\r\ncalled the temple of Venus Erycina, just before the Colline Gate; in\r\naddition to the temple it has a portico well worthy of notice.† The\r\nother settlement and most of the interior have been left to the\r\nshepherds for pasturage; for we do not know that Himera is yet\r\ninhabited,[2320] or Gela,[2321] or Callipolis, or Selinus, or Eubœa, or\r\nmany other places; of these the Zanclæi of Mylæ[2322] founded\r\nHimera,[2323] the people of Naxos, Callipolis,[2324] the Megaræans of\r\nSicily,[2325] Selinus,[2326] and the Leontini[2327] Eubœa.[2328] Many\r\ntoo of the cities of the aboriginal inhabitants[2329] have been\r\ndestroyed, as Camici, the kingdom of Cocalus, at whose house Minos is\r\nreported to have been treacherously cut off. The Romans therefore,\r\nconsidering the deserted condition of the country, and having got\r\npossession both of the hills and the most part of the plains, have given\r\nthem over to horse-breeders, herdsmen, and shepherds, by whom the island\r\nhas frequently been brought into great perils. First of all the\r\nshepherds, taking to pillage here and there in different places, and\r\nafterwards assembling in numbers and forcibly taking settlements; for\r\ninstance, as those under the command of Eunus[2330] seized upon\r\nEnna.[2331] And quite recently, during the time that we were at Rome, a\r\ncertain Selurus, called the son of Ætna, was sent up to that city. He\r\nhad been the captain of a band of robbers, and had for a long time\r\ninfested the country round Ætna, committing frequent depredations. We\r\nsaw him torn to pieces by wild beasts in the forum after a contest of\r\ngladiators: he had been set upon a platform fashioned to represent Mount\r\nÆtna, which being suddenly unfastened and falling, he was precipitated\r\namongst certain cages of wild beasts, which had also been slightly\r\nconstructed under the platform for the occasion.\r\n\r\n7. The fertility of the country is so generally extolled by every one,\r\nas nothing inferior to Italy, that there is a question as to what we\r\nshould say of it. Indeed, for wheat, honey, saffron, and some other\r\ncommodities, it even surpasses that country. In addition to this, its\r\nproximity renders the island like a part of Italy itself, so that it\r\nsupplies the Roman market with produce both commodiously and without\r\ntrouble. Indeed they call it the granary of Rome, for all the produce of\r\nthe island is carried thither, except a few things required for home\r\nconsumption. It consists not only of the fruits of the earth, but of\r\ncattle, skins, wool, and the like. Posidonius says that Syracuse and\r\nEryx are situated on the sea like two citadels, and that Enna in the\r\nmidst, between Syracuse and Eryx, commands the surrounding plains.\r\n†The[2332] whole [CAS. 273] territory of the Leontini, which was\r\npossessed by the people of Naxos settled in Sicily, suffered much, for\r\nthey always shared in the misfortunes of Syracuse, but not always in its\r\nprosperity.†\r\n\r\n8. Near to Centoripa is the town we have a little before mentioned,\r\nÆtna, which serves as a place for travellers about to ascend Mount Ætna,\r\nto halt and refresh themselves for the expedition. For here commences\r\nthe region in which is situated the summit of the mountain. The\r\ndistricts above are barren and covered with ashes, which are surmounted\r\nby the snows in winter: all below it however is filled with woods and\r\nplantations of all kinds. It seems that the summits of the mountain take\r\nmany changes by the ravages of the fire, which sometimes is brought\r\ntogether into one crater, and at another is divided; at one time again\r\nit heaves forth streams of lava, and at another flames and thick smoke:\r\nat other times again ejecting red-hot masses of fire-stone. In such\r\nviolent commotions as these the subterraneous passages must necessarily\r\nundergo a corresponding change, and at times the orifices on the surface\r\naround be considerably increased. Some who have very recently ascended\r\nthe mountain, reported[2333] to us, that they found at the top an even\r\nplain of about 20 stadia in circumference, enclosed by an overhanging\r\nridge of ashes about the height of a wall, so that those who are\r\ndesirous of proceeding further are obliged to leap down into the plain.\r\nThey noticed in the midst of it a mound; it was ash-coloured, as was\r\nlikewise the plain in appearance. Above the mound a column of cloud\r\nreared itself in a perpendicular line to the height of 200 stadia, and\r\nremained motionless (there being no air stirring at the time); it\r\nresembled smoke. Two of the party resolutely attempted to proceed\r\nfurther across this plain, but, finding the sand very hot and sinking\r\nvery deep in it, they turned back, without however being able to make\r\nany more particular observations, as to what we have described, than\r\nthose who beheld from a greater distance. They were, however, of\r\nopinion, from the observations they were able to make, that much\r\nexaggeration pervades the accounts we have of the volcano, and\r\nespecially the tale about Empedocles, that he leaped into the crater,\r\nand left as a vestige of his folly one of the brazen sandals which he\r\nwore, it being found outside at a short distance from the lip of the\r\ncrater, with the appearance of having been cast up by the violence of\r\nthe flame; for neither is the place approachable nor even visible, nor\r\nyet was it likely that any thing could be cast in thither, on account of\r\nthe contrary current of the vapours and other matters cast up from the\r\nlower parts of the mountain, and also on account of the overpowering\r\nexcess of heat, which would most likely meet any one long before\r\napproaching the mouth of the crater; and if eventually any thing should\r\nbe cast down, it would be totally decomposed before it were cast up\r\nagain, what manner of form soever it might have had at first. And again,\r\nalthough it is not unreasonable to suppose that the force of the vapour\r\nand fire is occasionally slackened for want of a continual supply of\r\nfuel, still we are not to conclude that it is ever possible for a man to\r\napproach it in the presence of so great an opposing power. Ætna more\r\nespecially commands the shore along the Strait and Catana, but it also\r\noverlooks the sea that washes Tyrrhenia and the Lipari Islands. By night\r\na glowing light appears on its summit, but in the day-time it is\r\nenveloped with smoke and thick darkness.\r\n\r\n9. The Nebrodes mountains[2334] take their rise opposite[2335] to Ætna;\r\nthey are not so lofty as Ætna, but extend over a much greater surface.\r\nThe whole island is hollow under ground, and full of rivers and fire\r\nlike the bed of the Tyrrhenian Sea,[2336] as far as Cumæa, as we before\r\ndescribed.[2337] For there are hot springs in many places in the island,\r\nsome of which are saline, as those named Selinuntia[2338] and the\r\nsprings at Himera, while those at Ægesta[2339] are fresh. Near to\r\nAcragas[2340] there are certain lakes,[2341] the waters of which taste\r\nlike the sea, but their [CAS. 274] properties are very different, for if\r\nthose who do not know how to swim plunge into them, they are not covered\r\nover by them, but float on the surface like pieces of wood.\r\n\r\nThe Palici[2342] possess craters which cast up water in a jet, having\r\nthe appearance of a dome, and then receive it back again into the same\r\nplace it rose from. The cavern near Mataurum[2343] has within it a\r\nconsiderable channel, with a river flowing through it under ground for a\r\nlong distance, and afterwards emerging to the surface as does the\r\nEl-Asi[2344] in Syria, which, after descending into the chasm between\r\nApameia and Antioch, which they call Charybdis, rises again to the\r\nsurface at the distance of about 40 stadia. Much the same circumstances\r\nare remarked of the Tigris[2345] in Mesopotamia, and the Nile in\r\nAfrica,[2346] a little before[2347] its most notorious springs. The\r\nwater in the neighbourhood of the city of Stymphalus, having passed\r\nunder ground about 200 stadia, gives rise to the river Erasinus[2348] in\r\nArgia;[2349] and again, the waters which are ingulfed with a low roaring\r\nsound near Asea[2350] in Arcadia, after a long course, spring forth with\r\nsuch copiousness as to form the Eurotas and the Alpheus,[2351] whence\r\nhas arisen a fable extensively credited, that if a certain charm is\r\nuttered over each of two crowns on their being cast into the stream\r\nwhere the two rivers flow in a common channel, each crown will make its\r\nappearance in its respective river according to the charm. As for what\r\nwe might add with reference to the Timao,[2352] it has already been\r\nparticularized.\r\n\r\n10. Phænomena, similar to these, and such as take place throughout\r\nSicily,[2353] are witnessed in the Lipari Islands, and especially in\r\nLipari itself.—These islands are seven in number, the chief of which is\r\nLipari, a colony of the Cnidians.[2354] It is nearest to Sicily after\r\nThermessa.[2355] It was originally named Meligunis. It was possessed of\r\na fleet, and for a considerable time repelled the incursions of the\r\nTyrrheni.[2356] The islands now called Liparæan were subject to it, some\r\ncall them the islands of Æolus. The citizens were so successful as to\r\nmake frequent offerings of the spoils taken in war to the temple of\r\nApollo at Delphi.[2357] It possesses a fertile soil,[2358] [CAS. 275] and\r\nmines[2359] of alum easy to be wrought, hot springs,[2360] and craters.\r\n[Thermessa] is, as it were, situated between this and Sicily; it is now\r\ndesignated as Hiera, or sacred to Vulcan; it is entirely rocky, and\r\ndesert, and volcanic. In it are three craters, and the flames which\r\nissue from the largest are accompanied with burning masses of lava,\r\nwhich have already obstructed a considerable portion of the strait\r\n[between Thermessa and the island Lipari]; repeated observations have\r\nled to the belief that the flames of the volcanos, both in this island\r\nand at Mount Ætna, are stimulated by the winds[2361] as they rise; and\r\nwhen the winds are lulled, the flames also subside; nor is this without\r\nreason, for if the winds are both originally produced and kept up by the\r\nvapours arising from the sea, those who witness these phenomena will not\r\nbe surprised, if the fire should be excited in some such way, by the\r\nlike aliment and circumstances. Polybius tells us that one of the three\r\ncraters of the island has partly fallen down, while the larger of the\r\ntwo that remain has a lip, the circumference of which is five stadia,\r\nand the diameter nearly 50 feet,[2362] and its elevation about a stadium\r\nfrom the level of the sea, which may be seen at the base in calm\r\nweather; but if we are to credit this, we may as well attend to what has\r\nbeen reported concerning Empedocles. [Polybius] also says, that “when\r\nthe south wind is to blow, a thick cloud lies stretched round the\r\nisland, so that one cannot see even as far as Sicily in the distance;\r\nbut when there is to be a north wind, the clear flames ascend to a great\r\nheight above the said crater, and great rumblings are heard; while for\r\nthe west wind effects are produced about half way between these two. The\r\nother craters are similarly affected, but their exhalations are not so\r\nviolent. Indeed, it is possible to foretell what wind will blow three\r\ndays beforehand, from the degree of intensity of the rumbling, and also\r\nfrom the part whence the exhalations, flames, and smoky blazes issue. It\r\nis said indeed that some of the inhabitants of the Lipari Islands, at\r\ntimes when there has been so great a calm that no ship could sail out of\r\nport, have predicted what wind would blow, and have not been mistaken.”\r\nFrom hence indeed that which seems to be the most fabulous invention of\r\nthe poet, appears not to have been written without some foundation, and\r\nhe appears to have merely used an allegorical style, while guided by the\r\ntruth, when he says that Æolus is the steward of the winds;[2363]\r\nhowever, we have formerly said enough as to this.[2364] We will now\r\nreturn to the point whence we digressed.\r\n\r\n11. We have noticed the islands of Lipari and Thermessa. As for\r\nStrongyle,[2365] it takes its name from its form.[2366] Like the other\r\ntwo, it is subigneous, but is deficient in the force of the flames which\r\nare emitted, while their brightness is greater. It is here they say that\r\nÆolus resided.[2367] The fourth is Didyma; this island also is named\r\nfrom its form.[2368] Of the others, [the fifth and sixth] are [CAS. 276]\r\nEricussa[2369] and Phœnicussa;[2370] they are called from the plants\r\nwhich they produce, and are given up to pasture. The seventh [island] is\r\ncalled Euonymus;[2371] it is the farthest in the sea and barren. It is\r\ncalled Euonymus because it lies the most to the left when you sail from\r\nthe island of Lipari to Sicily,[2372] and many times flames of fire have\r\nbeen seen to rise to the surface, and play upon the sea round the\r\nislands: these flames rush with violence from the cavities at the bottom\r\nof the sea,[2373] and force for themselves a passage to the open air.\r\nPosidonius says, that at a time so recent as to be almost within his\r\nrecollection, about the summer solstice and at break of day, between\r\nHiera and Euonymus, the sea was observed to be suddenly raised aloft,\r\nand to abide some time raised in a compact mass and then to subside.\r\nSome ventured to approach that part in their ships; they observed the\r\nfish dead and driven by the current, but being distressed by the heat\r\nand foul smell, were compelled to turn back. One of the boats which had\r\napproached nearest lost some of her crew, and was scarcely able to reach\r\nLipari with the rest, and they had fits like an epileptic person, at one\r\ntime fainting and giddy, and at another returning to their senses; and\r\nmany days afterwards a mud or clay was observed rising in the sea, and\r\nin many parts the flames issued, and smoke and smoky blazes; afterwards\r\nit congealed and became a rock like mill-stones. Titus Flaminius,[2374]\r\nwho then commanded in Sicily, despatched to the senate [of Rome] a full\r\naccount of the phenomenon; the senate sent and offered sacrifices to the\r\ninfernal and marine divinities both in the little island [which had thus\r\nbeen formed] and the Lipari Islands. Now the chorographer reckons that\r\nfrom Ericodes to Phœnicodes are 10 miles, from thence to Didyma 30, from\r\nthence to the northernmost point[2375] of Lipari 29, and from thence to\r\nSicily 19, while from Strongyle are 16.[2376] Melita[2377] lies\r\nbefore[2378] Pachynus; from thence come the little dogs called\r\nMaltese;[2379] so does also Gaudus,[2380] both of them are situated\r\nabout 88 miles distant from that promontory. Cossura[2381] is situated\r\nbefore Cape Lilybæum, and opposite the Carthaginian city Aspis, which\r\nthey call [in Latin] Clypea, it is situated in the midst of the space\r\nwhich lies between those [CAS. 277] two places, and is distant from each\r\nthe number of miles last given.[2382] Ægimurus also and other little\r\nislands lie off Sicily and Africa. So much for the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Having previously passed over the regions of ancient Italy as far as\r\nMetapontium, we must now proceed to describe the rest. After it\r\nIapygia[2383] comes next in order; the Greeks call it Messapia, but the\r\ninhabitants, dividing it into cantons, call one the Salentini,[2384]\r\nthat in the neighbourhood of the Cape[2385] Iapygia, and another the\r\nCalabri;[2386] above these towards the north lie the Peucetii,[2387] and\r\nthose who are called Daunii[2388] in the Greek language, but the\r\ninhabitants call the whole region beyond the Calabri, Apulia. Some of\r\nthese people are called Pœdicli,[2389] especially the Peucetii. Messapia\r\nforms a peninsula; the isthmus extending from Brentesium[2390] to\r\nTarentum, which bounds it, being 310 stadia, and the circumnavigation\r\nround the Iapygian promontory[2391] about [one thousand][2392] four\r\nhundred. [Tarentum[2393]] is distant from Metapontium[2394] about two\r\nhundred and [twenty[2393]] stadia. The course to it by sea runs in an\r\neasterly direction. The Gulf of Tarentum is for the most part destitute\r\nof a port, but here there is a spacious and commodious [harbour[2395]],\r\nclosed in by a great bridge. It is 100 stadia[2396] in circuit. This\r\nport, at the head of its basin which recedes most inland, forms, with\r\nthe exterior sea, an isthmus which connects the peninsula with the land.\r\nThe city is situated upon this peninsula. The neck of land is so low\r\nthat ships are easily hauled over it from either side. The site of the\r\ncity likewise is extremely low; the ground, however, rises slightly\r\ntowards the citadel. The old wall of the city has an immense circuit,\r\nbut now the portion towards the isthmus is deserted, but that standing\r\nnear the mouth of the harbour, where the citadel is situated, still\r\nsubsists, and contains a considerable city. It possesses a noble\r\ngymnasium and a spacious forum, in which there is set up a brazen\r\ncolossus of Jupiter, the largest that ever was, with the exception of\r\nthat of Rhodes. The citadel is situated between the forum and the\r\nentrance of the harbour, it still preserves some slight relics of its\r\nancient magnificence [CAS. 278] and gifts, but the chief of them were\r\ndestroyed either by the Carthaginians[2397] when they took the city, or\r\nby the Romans[2398] when they took it by force and sacked it. Amongst\r\nother booty taken on this occasion[2399] was the brazen colossus of\r\nHercules, the work of Lysippus, now in the Capitol, which was dedicated\r\nas an offering by Fabius Maximus, who took the city.\r\n\r\n2. Antiochus, speaking of the foundation of this city, says that after\r\nthe Messenian war[2400] such of the Lacedæmonians as did not join the\r\narmy were sentenced to be slaves, and denominated Helots; and that such\r\nas were born during the period of the war they termed Partheniæ, and\r\ndecreed to be base: but these not bearing the reproach, (for they were\r\nmany,) conspired against the free citizens,[2401] but the chief\r\nmagistrates, becoming acquainted with the existence of the plot,\r\nemployed certain persons, who, by feigning friendship to the cause,\r\nshould be able to give some intelligence of the nature of it. Of this\r\nnumber was Phalanthus, who was apparently the chief leader of them, but\r\nwho was not quite pleased with those who had been named to conduct their\r\ndeliberations.[2402] It was agreed that at the Hyacinthine games,\r\ncelebrated in the temple of Amyclæ, just at the conclusion of the\r\ncontest, and when Phalanthus should put on his helmet,[2403] they should\r\nmake a simultaneous attack. The free citizens[2401] were distinguishable\r\nfrom others by their hair. They, having been secretly warned as to the\r\narrangements made for the signal of Phalanthus, just as the chief\r\ncontest came off, a herald came forward and proclaimed, “Let not\r\nPhalanthus put on his helmet.” The conspirators perceiving that the plot\r\nwas disclosed, some fled, and others supplicated mercy. When the chief\r\nmagistrates had bid them not to fear, they committed them to prison,\r\nbut sent Phalanthus to inquire after a new settlement. He received from\r\nthe oracle the following response,\r\n\r\n   “To thee Satyrium[2404] I have given, and the rich country of\r\n   Tarentum to inhabit, and thou shalt become a scourge to the\r\n   Iapygians.”\r\n\r\nThe Partheniæ accordingly accompanied Phalanthus to their destination,\r\nand the barbarians and Cretans,[2405] who already possessed the country,\r\nreceived them kindly. They say that these Cretans were the party who\r\nsailed with Minos to Sicily, and that after his death, which took place\r\nat Camici,[2406] in the palace of Cocalus, they took ship and set sail\r\nfrom Sicily, but in their voyage they were cast by tempest on this\r\ncoast, some of whom, afterwards coasting the Adriatic on foot, reached\r\nMacedonia, and were called Bottiæi.[2407] They further add, that all the\r\npeople who reach as far as Daunia were called Iapygians, from Iapyx, who\r\nwas born to Dædalus by a Cretan woman, and became a chief leader of the\r\nCretans. The city Tarentum was named from a certain hero.[2408]\r\n\r\n3. Ephorus gives the following account of the foundation. The\r\nLacedæmonians waged war against the Messenians, who had murdered their\r\nking, Teleclus,[2409] when he visited Messene to offer sacrifice. They\r\ntook an oath that they would not return home before they had destroyed\r\nMessene, or should be [CAS. 279] all slain. They left only the youngest\r\nand oldest of the citizens to keep their own country. After this, in the\r\ntenth [year] of the war, the Lacedæmonian matrons assembled and deputed\r\ncertain women to remonstrate with the citizens, and show them that they\r\nwere carrying on the war with the Messenians on very disadvantageous\r\nterms, for they, abiding in their own country, procreated children,\r\nwhile the Lacedæmonians, leaving their wives in a state like widowhood,\r\nremained away in the war; and to expose the great peril there was of the\r\ndepopulation of their country. The Lacedæmonians, being both desirous of\r\nobserving their oath, and taking into consideration the representations\r\nof their wives, sent a deputation of the most vigorous, and, at the same\r\ntime, most juvenile of the army, whom they considered, in a manner, not\r\nto have participated in the oath, because they had been but children\r\nwhen they accompanied their elders to the war, and charged them all to\r\ncompany with all the maidens, reckoning that by that means they would\r\nbear the more children; which having been accordingly obeyed, the\r\nchildren who were born were denominated Partheniæ. Messene was taken\r\nafter a war of nineteen years, as Tyrtæus says,\r\n\r\n     “The fathers of our fathers, armed for war,\r\n   Possessing ever patient courage, fought at Messene\r\n     For nineteen years with unremitting toil.\r\n     Till on the twentieth, leaving their rich soil,\r\n   The enemy forsook the towering heights of Ithome.”[2410]\r\n\r\nThus then did they destroy Messenia, but returning home, they neglected\r\nto honour the Partheniæ like other youths, and treated them as though\r\nthey had been born out of wedlock. The Partheniæ, leaguing with the\r\nHelots, conspired against the Lacedæmonians, and agreed to raise a\r\nLaconic felt hat[2411] in the market-place as a signal for the\r\ncommencement of hostilities. Some of the Helots betrayed the plot, but\r\nthe government found it difficult to resist them by force, for they were\r\nmany, and all unanimous, and looked upon each other as brothers; those\r\nin authority therefore commanded such as were appointed to raise the\r\nsignal, to depart out of the market-place; when they therefore perceived\r\nthat their plot was disclosed they desisted, and the Lacedæmonians\r\npersuaded them, through the instrumentality of their fathers, to leave\r\nthe country and colonize: and advised them, if they should get\r\npossession of a convenient place, to abide in it, but if not, they\r\npromised that a fifth part of Messenia should be divided amongst them on\r\ntheir return. So they departed and found the Greeks carrying on\r\nhostilities against the barbarians, and taking part in the perils of the\r\nwar, they obtained possession of Tarentum, which they colonized.\r\n\r\n4. At one time, when the government of the Tarentines had assumed a\r\ndemocratic form, they rose to great importance; for they possessed the\r\ngreatest fleet of any state in those parts, and could bring into the\r\nfield an army of 30,000 foot and 3000 horse, exclusive of a select body\r\nof 1000 cavalry called Hipparchi.[2412] They likewise encouraged the\r\nPythagorean philosophy, and Archytas, who for a long time presided over\r\nthe government of their state, gave it his special support.[2413] But at\r\na later period their luxury, which was produced by their prosperity,\r\nincreased to that degree that their general holidays or festivals\r\nexceeded in number the days of the year; and hence arose an inefficient\r\ngovernment, and as one proof of their unstatesmanlike acts we may adduce\r\ntheir employment of foreign generals; for they sent for Alexander,[2414]\r\nking of the Molossi, to come and assist them against the Messapii and\r\nLeucani. They had before that employed Archidamus, the son of\r\nAgesilaus;[2415] afterwards they called in Cleonymus[2416] and\r\nAgathocles,[2417] and later, when they rose against the Romans,\r\nPyrrhus.[2418] They were not able even to retain the respect of those\r\nwhom they had invited, but rather merited their disgust. Alexander [of\r\nEpirus] was so displeased with them that he endeavoured to remove the\r\nseat of the general council of the Greek states in Italy, which was\r\naccustomed to assemble at Heraclea, a city of the Tarentines, to a city\r\nof the Thurii; and he commanded that some place on the river\r\nAcalandrus,[2419] [CAS. 281] commodious for their meetings, should be\r\nproperly fortified for their reception.—And indeed they say that the\r\nmisfortune[2420] of that prince was chiefly due to a want of good\r\nfeeling on their part. They were deprived of their liberty during the\r\nwars[2421] of Hannibal, but have since received a Roman colony,[2422]\r\nand now live in peace and are in a more prosperous state than ever. They\r\nalso engaged in war with the Messapii concerning Heraclea, when they\r\ncounted the kings of the Daunii and of the Peucetii as allies.[2423]\r\n\r\n5. The remainder of the country of the Iapygii is very fair,\r\nnotwithstanding unfavourable appearances; for although, for the most\r\npart, it appears rugged, yet when it is broken up the soil is found to\r\nbe deep; and although it lacks water, yet it appears well-suited for\r\npasture, and is furnished with trees. At one time it was thickly\r\ninhabited throughout its whole extent, and possessed thirteen cities,\r\nbut now it is so depopulated that, with the exception of Tarentum and\r\nBrentesium,[2424] they only deserve the name of hamlets. They say that\r\nthe Salentini are a colony of Cretans. Here is the temple of\r\nMinerva,[2425] which formerly was rich, and the rock called Acra\r\nIapygia,[2426] which juts out far into the sea towards the rising of the\r\nsun in winter,[2427] and turning, as it were, towards Cape Lacinium,\r\nwhich lies opposite to it on the west, it closes the entrance of the\r\nGulf of Tarentum, as on the other side, the Ceraunian Mountains,\r\ntogether with the said Cape, close the entrance of the Ionian Gulf, the\r\nrun across is about 700 stadia from that,[2428] both to the Ceraunian\r\nMountains and to Cape Lacinium.[2429] In coasting along the shore from\r\nTarentum to Brentesium there are 600 stadia as far as the little city of\r\nBaris, which is at the present time called Veretum,[2430] and is\r\nsituated on the extremities of the Salentine territory; the approach to\r\nit from Tarentum is much easier on foot[2431] than by sea. Thence to\r\nLeuca are 80 stadia; this too is but a small village, in which there is\r\nshown a well of fetid water, and the legend runs, that when Hercules\r\ndrove out the last of the giants from Phlegra in Campania, who were\r\ncalled Leuternians, some fled and were buried here, and that from their\r\nblood a spring issues to supply the well; on this account likewise the\r\ncoast is called the Leuternian coast.[2432] From Leuca to Hydrus,[2433]\r\na small town, 150 stadia. From thence to Brentesium 400, and the like\r\ndistance also [from Hydrus] to the island Saso,[2434] which is situated\r\nalmost in the midst of the course from Epirus to Brentesium; and\r\ntherefore when vessels are unable to obtain a direct passage they run to\r\nthe left from Saso to Hydrus, and thence watching for a favourable wind\r\nthey steer towards the haven of Brentesium, or the passengers\r\ndisembarking proceed on foot by a shorter way through Rudiæ, a Grecian\r\ncity, where the poet Ennius was born.[2435] The district which we have\r\nfollowed by sea from [CAS. 282] Tarentum to Brentesium is like a\r\npeninsula. The road by land from Brentesium to Tarentum is but a day’s\r\njourney for a light person on foot, it constitutes the isthmus of the\r\nsaid peninsula, which people in general call Messapia, Iapygia,\r\nCalabria, or Salentinum, without being at all particular; but some, as\r\nwe have said before, do make a distinction. Thus have we described the\r\ntowns on the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n6. In the inland are Rudiæ and Lupiæ, and at a short distance from the\r\nsea Aletia;[2436] about the middle of the isthmus is Uria,[2437] in\r\nwhich is still shown the palace of a certain famous nobleman.[2438] As\r\nHyria[2439] is described by Herodotus as situated in Iapygia, and as\r\nfounded by the Cretans who strayed from the fleet of Minos while sailing\r\nto Sicily;[2440] we must suppose that he meant either this place [Uria]\r\nor Veretum. It is said that a colony of Cretans settled in\r\nBrentesium,[2441] but the tradition varies; some say they were those who\r\ncame with Theseus from Cnossus;[2442] others, that they were some out of\r\nSicily who had come with Iapyx; they agree however in saying that they\r\ndid not abide there, but went thence to Bottiæa. At a later period, when\r\nthe state was under the government of a monarch, it lost a large portion\r\nof its territories, which was taken by the Lacedæmonians who came over\r\nunder Phalanthus; notwithstanding this the Brundusians received him when\r\nhe was expelled from Tarentum, and honoured him with a splendid tomb at\r\nhis death. They possess a district of superior fertility to that of the\r\nTarentines; for its soil is light, still it is fruitful, and its honey\r\nand wools are amongst the most esteemed; further, the harbour of\r\nBrentesium is superior to that of Tarentum, for many havens are\r\nprotected by the single entrance,[2443] and rendered perfectly smooth,\r\nmany bays [or reaches] being formed within it, so that it resembles in\r\nfashion the antlers of a stag, whence its name, for the place, together\r\nwith the city, is exceedingly like the head of a stag, and in the\r\nMessapian language the stag’s head is called Brentesium; while the port\r\nof Tarentum is not entirely safe, both on account of its lying very\r\nopen, and of certain shallows near its head.\r\n\r\n7. Further, the course for passengers from Greece and Asia is most\r\ndirect to Brentesium, and in fact all who are journeying to Rome\r\ndisembark here. Hence there are two ways to Rome; one, which is only\r\nwalked by mules, through the Peucetii, who are called Pœdicli, the\r\nDaunii, and the Samnites, as far as Beneventum, on which road is the\r\ncity Egnatia,[2444] then Celia,[2445] Netium,[2446] Canusium,[2447] and\r\nHerdonia.[2448] That through Tarentum is a little to the left, it runs\r\nabout a day’s journey round for one traversing the whole distance; it is\r\ncalled the Appian Way, and is more of a carriage road than the other. On\r\nit stands the city Uria,[2449] and Venusia;[2450] the one [Uria] between\r\nTarentum and Brentesium, the other on the confines of the Samnites and\r\nLucani. Both the roads from Brentesium run into one near Beneventum and\r\nCampania, and thence to Rome it receives the name of Appian, and runs\r\nthrough Caudium,[2451] Calatia,[2452] Capua,[2453] and Casilinum,[2454]\r\nto Sinuessa.[2455] The way from thence to Rome has been already\r\ndescribed.—The whole length of the Appian Way from Rome to Brentesium\r\nis 360 miles.\r\n\r\nThere is a third way from Rhegium, through the Bruttii, Lucani, and\r\nSamnites, along the chain of the Apennines, into [CAS. 283] Campania,\r\nwhere it joins the Appian Way;[2456] it is longer than those from\r\nBrentesium by about three or four days’ journey.\r\n\r\n8. From Brentesium the sea is traversed by two passages to the opposite\r\ncoast, one crossing to the Ceraunian[2457] Mountains and the adjacent\r\ncoasts of the Epirus and Greece, the other to Epidamnus,[2458] which is\r\nthe longer[2459] of the two, being 1800[2460] stadia. Still this is\r\nhabitually traversed, on account of the situation of the city\r\n[Epidamnus] being convenient for the nations of Illyria and Macedonia.\r\nAs we coast along the shore of the Adriatic from Brentesium we come to\r\nthe city Egnatia,[2461] it is the general place to stop at for those\r\ntravelling to Barium,[2462] as well by land as by sea. The run is made\r\nwhen the wind blows from the south. The territory of the Peucetii\r\nextends as far as this along the coast, in the interior of the land it\r\nreaches as far as Silvium.[2463] It is throughout rugged and\r\nmountainous, and chiefly occupied by the Apennine mountains. It is\r\nthought to have been colonized by a party of Arcadians. The distance\r\nfrom Brentesium to Barium is about 700 stadia. [Tarentum] is about\r\nequally distant from both.[2464] The Daunii inhabit the adjoining\r\ndistrict, then the Apuli as far as the Phrentani. As the inhabitants of\r\nthe district, except in ancient times, have never been particular in\r\nspeaking of the Peucetii or Daunii precisely, and as the whole of this\r\ncountry is now called Apulia, the boundaries of these nations are\r\nnecessarily but ill defined: wherefore we ourselves shall not be very\r\nexact in treating of them.\r\n\r\n9. From Barium to the river Ofanto,[2465] on which the Canusitæ have\r\nestablished an emporium, there are 400[2466] stadia. The course up the\r\nriver to the emporium is 90 [stadia]. Near it is Salapia,[2467] the port\r\nof the Argyrippeni. For the two cities, Canusium and Argyrippa, are\r\nsituated at no great distance from the sea, and in the midst of a plain;\r\nat one time they were the most important cities of the Greeks of Italy,\r\nas is manifest from the circumference of their walls, but now they have\r\nfallen off. One of them was originally called Argos Hippium, then\r\nArgyrippa, and then again Arpi. They are said to have been both founded\r\nby Diomed, and both the plain of Diomed and many other things are shown\r\nin these districts as evidence of his having possessed them. Such were\r\nthe ancient offerings in the temple of Minerva, at Luceria.[2468] That\r\nwas an ancient city of the Daunii, but now it is of no account. Again,\r\nin the neighbouring sea there are two islands called the Diomedean\r\nislands, one of which is inhabited, but the other, they say, is desert:\r\nin the latter it is fabled that Diomed disappeared from the earth, and\r\nthat his companions were transformed into birds,[2469] and indeed the\r\nfable goes so far as to prolong their race to the present time, saying\r\nthat they are tame, and lead a sort of human life, both in respect of\r\nfood, and their readiness to approach men of gentle manners, and to shun\r\nthe evil and wanton. We have already noticed[2470] what is currently\r\nreported amongst the Heneti concerning this hero [Diomed] and the\r\nhonours decreed to him by custom. It is thought also that Sipus[2471]\r\nwas a settlement founded by Diomed, [CAS. 284] it is distant from\r\nSalapia about 140 stadia, and was called by the Greeks Sepius, from the\r\nnumbers of cuttle fish[2472] thrown up by the sea along its shore.\r\nBetween Salapia and Sipus is a navigable river, and a considerable\r\nestuary; by both of these channels the merchandise, and wheat\r\nespecially, of Sipus is conveyed to the sea. Two heroa or shrines are\r\nshown on a hill of Daunia, called Drium, one on the very brow of the\r\nhill sacred to Calchas, those who are about to inquire of the oracle\r\noffer a black ram to him, and sleep upon the fleece, the other below\r\nnear the foot of the hill is dedicated to Podalirius, it is about a\r\nhundred stadia distant from the sea; from this hill also flows a\r\nstream,[2473] which is a potent cure for all manner of diseases among\r\ncattle.[2474] The promontory of Garganum[2475] running into the sea,\r\njuts out from this bay about 300 stadia.[2476] As you turn the point you\r\nperceive the town of Urium,[2477] while off the headland are seen the\r\nDiomedean islands. All this coast produces everything in great\r\nabundance, it is exceedingly well adapted for horses and sheep, and the\r\nwool is finer than that of Tarentum, but less glossy. The district is\r\nmild on account of the cup-like situation of the plains. There are some\r\nwho report that Diomed attempted to cut a canal to the sea, but being\r\nsent for to return home, where he died, left it incomplete, as well as\r\nother undertakings. This is one account of him: another makes him abide\r\nhere till the end of his days; a third is the fable I have already\r\nnoticed, that he vanished in the island [of Teutria], and one might\r\nreckon as a fourth that of the Heneti,[2478] for they somehow make out\r\nthat he finished his career among them, as they assert his apotheosis.\r\nThe distances I have thus given are laid down in accordance with those\r\nof Artemidorus.\r\n\r\n10. The chorographer indeed gives only 165 miles from Brentesium[2479]\r\nto Garganum, but Artemidorus makes them more.[2480] Thence to Ancona,\r\nthe first says there are 254 miles, whilst Artemidorus has given but\r\n1250 stadia to the Fiumesino,[2481] near to Ancona, which is much\r\nshorter. Polybius says that from Iapygia the distance has been laid down\r\nin miles, and that there are 562 miles thence to the town of Sila,[2482]\r\nthence to Aquileia 178. These geographers do not agree as to the length\r\nto be assigned to the line of the sea-coast of Illyria, run from the\r\nCeraunian Mountains[2483] to the head[2484] of the Adriatic, some of\r\nthem stating it to be above 6000 [stadia], and making it longer than the\r\nopposite coast [of Italy], while it is much shorter.[2485] Indeed they\r\nall generally differ among themselves in stating distances, as we often\r\nhave occasion to remark. Wherever it is possible to discriminate we set\r\nforth what appears to us to be correct, but where it is impossible to\r\ncome to any safe conclusion we think it our duty to publish their\r\nseveral assertions. However, when we have no data furnished by them, it\r\nmust not be wondered at, if we should leave some points untouched in\r\ntreating of such and so vast a subject as we have undertaken. We would\r\nnot indeed omit any of the important particulars, but trifling\r\ncircumstances, even when they are noted, are of little advantage, and\r\nwhen taken no heed of, are not missed, nor does their omission at all\r\nimpair the whole work, or, if it does, at most not much.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 285] 11. Immediately beyond the Garganum comes a deep bay.[2486]\r\nThose who dwell round it call themselves Apuli,[2487] they speak the\r\nsame language as the Daunii and Peucetii, and at the present time\r\nresemble them in every other particular; however it is likely that they\r\nwere formerly distinct, since their names completely differ from those\r\nof the others. In ancient times the whole of this country was\r\nflourishing, but Hannibal and the wars which subsequently occurred have\r\nwasted it. Here too was fought the battle of Cannæ, where there was so\r\ngreat a slaughter of the Roman forces and their allies.[2488] Near this\r\ngulf there is a lake,[2489] and above the lake in the interior is the\r\nApulian Teanum,[2490] having a like name with that of the\r\nSidicini.[2491] It is between this and the neighbourhood of\r\nDicæarchia[2492] that the breadth of Italy is so contracted as to form\r\nan isthmus of less than 1000 stadia from sea to sea.[2493] Leaving the\r\nlake we sail next to Buca,[2494] and the country of the Frentani. There\r\nare 200 stadia from the lake both to Buca and to the Garganum. The\r\nremainder of the towns in the vicinity of Buca have been before\r\ndescribed.[2495]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. So great indeed is Italy, and much as we have described it; we will\r\nnow advert to the chief of the many things that have been described,\r\nwhich have conduced to raise the Romans to so great a height of\r\nprosperity. One point is its insular position, by which it is securely\r\nguarded, the seas forming a natural protection around it with the\r\nexception of a very inconsiderable frontier, which too is fortified by\r\nalmost impassable mountains. A second is, that there are but few\r\nharbours, and those few capacious and admirably situated. These are of\r\ngreat service both for enterprises against foreign places, and also in\r\ncase of invasions undertaken against the country, and the reception of\r\nabundant merchandise. And a third, that it is situated so as to possess\r\nmany advantages of atmosphere and temperature of climate, in which both\r\nanimals and plants, and in fact all things available for sustaining\r\nlife, may be accommodated with every variety both of mild and severe\r\ntemperature; its length stretches in a direction north and south.\r\nSicily, which is extensive, may be looked upon as an addition to its\r\nlength, for we cannot consider it in any other light than as a part of\r\nit. The salubrity or severity of the atmosphere of different countries,\r\nis estimated by the amount of cold or heat, or the degrees of\r\ntemperature between those extremes; in this way we shall find that\r\nItaly, which is situated in the medium of both the extremes, and having\r\nso great a length, largely participates in a salubrious atmosphere, and\r\nthat in many respects. This advantage is still secured to it in another\r\nway, for the chain of the Apennines extending through its whole length,\r\nand leaving on each side plains and fruitful hills, there is no district\r\nwhich does not participate in the advantages of the best productions\r\nboth of hill and plain. We must also enumerate the magnitude and number\r\nof its rivers and lakes, and the springs of hot and cold waters supplied\r\nby nature in various localities for the restoration of health; and in\r\naddition to these, its great wealth in mines of all the metals,\r\nabundance of timber, and excellent food both for man and for beasts of\r\nall kinds. Italy, likewise, being situated in the very midst of the\r\ngreatest nations, I allude to Greece and the best provinces of Asia, is\r\nnaturally in a [CAS. 286] position to gain the ascendency, since she\r\nexcels the circumjacent countries both in the valour of her population\r\nand in extent of territory, and by being in proximity to them seems to\r\nhave been ordained to bring them into subjection without difficulty.\r\n\r\n2. If, in addition to our description of Italy, a few words should be\r\nsummarily added about the Romans who have possessed themselves of it,\r\nand prepared it as a centre from whence to enforce their universal\r\ndominion, we would offer the following.—The Romans, after the\r\nfoundation of their state, discreetly existed as a kingdom for many\r\nyears, till Tarquin, the last [Roman king], abused his power, when they\r\nexpelled him, and established a mixed form of government, being a\r\nmodification both of the monarchical and aristocratical systems; they\r\nadmitted both the Sabines[2496] and Latins[2497] into their alliance,\r\nbut as neither they nor the other neighbouring states continued to act\r\nwith good faith towards them at all times, they were under the necessity\r\nof aggrandizing themselves by the dismemberment of their\r\nneighbours.[2498] Having thus, by degrees, arrived at a state of\r\nconsiderable importance, it chanced that they lost their city suddenly,\r\ncontrary to the expectation of all men, and again recovered the same\r\ncontrary to all expectation.[2499] This took place, according to\r\nPolybius, in the nineteenth year after the naval engagement of\r\nÆgos-potami,[2500] about the time of the conclusion of the peace of\r\nAntalcidas.[2501] Having escaped these misfortunes, the Romans first\r\nreduced all the Latins[2502] to complete obedience, they then subdued\r\nthe Tyrrheni,[2503] and stayed the Kelts, who border the Po, from their\r\ntoo frequent and licentious forays; then the Samnites, and after them\r\nthey conquered the Tarentines and Pyrrhus,[2504] and presently after the\r\nremainder of what is now considered as Italy, with the exception of the\r\ndistricts on the Po. While these still remained a subject of dispute\r\nthey passed over into Sicily,[2505] and having wrested that island from\r\nthe Carthaginians[2506] they returned to complete the conquest of the\r\npeople dwelling along the Po. While this war was still in hand Hannibal\r\nentered Italy,[2507] thus the second war against the Carthaginians\r\nensued, and after a very short interval the third, in which Carthage was\r\ndemolished.[2508] At the same time the Romans became masters of\r\nAfrica,[2509] and of such portions of Spain as they won from the\r\nCarthaginians. Both the Greeks and the Macedonians, and the nations of\r\nAsia who dwelt on the hither side of the river Kizil-Irmak[2510] and the\r\nTaurus, took part in these struggles with the Carthaginians: over these\r\nAntiochus[2511] was king, and Philip and Perseus,[2512] these therefore\r\nthe Romans found themselves obliged to subdue. The people likewise of\r\nIllyria and Thrace, who were next neighbours to the Greeks and\r\nMacedonians, at this time commenced the war with the Romans that never\r\nceased, until the subjugation of all the people who inhabit the\r\ncountries on the hither side of the Danube[2513] and the\r\nKizil-Irmak[2510] had been effected. The Iberians, and Kelts, and all\r\nthe rest who are subject to the Romans, shared a similar fate, for the\r\nRomans never rested in the subjugation of the land to their sway until\r\nthey had entirely overthrown it: in the first instance they took\r\nNumantia,[2514] and subdued Viriathus,[2515] and afterwards vanquished\r\nSertorius,[2516] and last of all the Cantabrians,[2517] who were brought\r\nto subjection by Augustus Cæsar.[2518] Likewise the whole of Gaul both\r\nwithin and beyond the Alps with Liguria were annexed at first by a\r\npartial occupation, but subsequently divus Cæsar and then Augustus\r\nsubdued them completely in open war, so that now[2519] the Romans direct\r\ntheir expeditions against the Germans from these countries as the most\r\nconvenient rendezvous, and have already adorned their own country with\r\nseveral triumphs over them. Also in Africa all that did not belong to\r\nthe Carthaginians has been left to the charge of kings owning dependence\r\non the Roman state, while such as have attempted to assert their\r\nindependence have been overpowered. At the present moment both Maurusia\r\nand much of the rest [CAS. 288] of Africa have fallen to the portion of\r\nJuba[2520] on account of his good will and friendship towards the\r\nRomans. The like things have taken place in Asia. At first it was\r\ngoverned by kings who were dependent on the Romans, and afterwards when\r\ntheir several lines of succession failed, as of that of the kings\r\nAttalus,[2521] the kings of the Syrians,[2522] the Paphlagonians,[2523]\r\nCappadocians,[2524] and Egyptians,[2525] [or] when they revolted and\r\nwere subsequently deposed, as it happened in the case of Mithridates\r\nEupator, and Cleopatra of Egypt, the whole of their territories within\r\nthe Phasis[2526] and the Euphrates,[2527] with the exception of some\r\ntribes of Arabs, were brought completely under the dominion of the\r\nRomans and the dynasties set up by them. The Armenians and the people\r\nwho lie beyond Colchis, both the Albani and Iberians, require nothing\r\nmore than that Roman governors should be sent among them, and they would\r\nbe easily ruled; their attempted insurrections are merely the\r\nconsequence of the want of attention from the Romans, who are so much\r\noccupied elsewhere: the like may be asserted of those who dwell beyond\r\nthe Danube,[2528] and inhabit the banks of the Euxine, excepting only\r\nthose who dwell on the Bosphorus[2529] and the Nomades;[2530] of these\r\nthe former are in subjection to the Romans, and the latter are\r\nunprofitable for commerce on account of their wandering life, and only\r\nrequire to be watched. The rest of the countries [of Asia] are chiefly\r\ninhabited by Scenites[2531] and Nomades who dwell at a great distance.\r\nThe Parthians indeed border on them and are very powerful, but they have\r\nyielded so far to the superiority of the Romans and our emperors, that\r\nthey have not only sent back[2532] to Rome the trophies which they had\r\nat a still more distant period taken from the Romans, but Phraates has\r\neven sent his sons and his sons’ sons to Augustus Cæsar, as hostages,\r\nassiduously courting his friendship:[2533] indeed the [Parthians] of the\r\npresent time frequently send for a king from hence,[2534] and are almost\r\non the point of relinquishing all power to the Romans. We now see Italy,\r\nwhich has frequently been torn by civil war even since it came under the\r\ndominion of the Romans, nay, even Rome herself, restrained from rushing\r\nheadlong into confusion and destruction by the excellence of her form of\r\ngovernment and the ability of her emperors. Indeed it were hard to\r\nadminister the affairs of so great an empire otherwise than by\r\ncommitting them to one man as a father.[2535] For it would never have\r\nbeen in the power of the Romans and their allies to attain to a state of\r\nsuch perfect peace, and the enjoyment of such abundant prosperity, as\r\nAugustus Cæsar afforded them from the time that he took upon himself the\r\nabsolute authority; and which his son Tiberius, who has succeeded him,\r\nstill maintains, who takes his father for a pattern in his government\r\nand ordinances. And in their turn his sons, Germanicus and Drusus,[2536]\r\nwho are exercising the functions of government under their father, take\r\nhim for their model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nGERMANY.—THE CIMBRI, GETÆ, DACI.—MOUTHS OF THE DANUBE.—THE\r\nTAURICA CHERSONESUS, ILLYRICUM, HUNGARY, EPIRUS, DODONA,\r\nMACEDONIA, THRACE.—THE HELLESPONT.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   In the Seventh Book Strabo describes the remaining portions of\r\n   Europe. That on the east is the country beyond the Rhine, as far\r\n   as the Don[2537] and the mouth of the Sea of Azof;[2538] and on\r\n   the south, that which the Danube[2539] bounds, lying between the\r\n   Adriatic and the left shores of the Euxine, as far as Greece and\r\n   the Sea of Marmora,[2540] including the whole of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We have described Spain and the Keltic nations, together with Italy\r\nand the islands adjacent, and must now speak of the remaining portions\r\nof Europe, dividing it in the best way we can. That which remains is, on\r\nthe east, all the country beyond the Rhine, as far as the Don and the\r\nmouth of the Sea of Azof; and, on the south, that which the Danube\r\nbounds, lying between the Adriatic and the left shores of the Euxine, as\r\nfar as Greece and the Sea of Marmora, for the Danube, which is the\r\nlargest of the rivers of Europe, divides the whole territory of which we\r\nhave spoken, into two portions. This river from its commencement flows\r\nsouthwards, then, making a sudden turn, continues its course from west\r\nto east, which [terminates] in the Euxine Sea. It takes its rise in the\r\nwestern confines of Germany, not far from the head of the Adriatic,\r\nbeing distant from it about 1000 stadia,[2541] and falls into the Euxine\r\nnear the mouths of the Dniester[2542] and the Dnieper,[2543] inclining a\r\nlittle towards the north. Thus the countries beyond the Rhine and\r\nKeltica are situated to the north of the Danube, and are occupied by the\r\nGalatic and German tribes, as far as the territory of the\r\nBastarnæ,[2544] the Tyregetæ,[2545] and the river Dnieper; so also is\r\nthe country situated between the Dnieper, the Don, and the mouth of the\r\nSea of Azof, which on one side stretches back as far as the [Northern]\r\nOcean,[2546] and on another is washed by the Euxine. To the south of the\r\nDanube are situated the people of Illyria and Thrace, and mixed with\r\nthem certain tribes of Kelts and other races, extending as far as\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nWe will first speak of those nations to the north of the Danube, for\r\ntheir history is less involved than that of the tribes situated on the\r\nother side of the river.\r\n\r\n2. Next after the Keltic nations come the Germans who inhabit the\r\ncountry to the east beyond the Rhine; and these differ but little from\r\nthe Keltic race, except in their being more fierce, of a larger stature,\r\nand more ruddy in countenance; but in every other respect, their figure,\r\ntheir customs and manners of life, are such as we have related of the\r\nKelts.[2547] The Romans therefore, I think, have very appositely applied\r\nto them the name “Germani,” as signifying genuine; for in the Latin\r\nlanguage Germani signifies genuine.[2548]\r\n\r\n3. The first division of this country is the land extending along the\r\nRhine from its source to its embouchure. Indeed, the valley of that\r\nriver extends nearly as far as the whole breadth of Germany on the west.\r\nOf the people who occupied this country, some have been transplanted by\r\nthe Romans into Keltica, the others have retired to the interior, as the\r\nMarsi;[2549] there are but few remaining, and some portion of them [CAS.\r\n290] are Sicambri;[2550] next to the inhabitants of this valley succeeds\r\nthe tribe dwelling between the Rhine and the river Elbe,[2551] which\r\nriver flows towards the ocean in a direction nearly parallel with the\r\nRhine, and traversing a country of no less extent. There are also\r\nbetween these other navigable rivers, such as the Ems,[2552] on which\r\nDrusus defeated the Bructeri[2553] in a naval engagement; all likewise\r\nflowing from south to north, and falling into the ocean; for the whole\r\ncountry rises towards the south, and forms a ridge of mountains near the\r\nAlps, which extends eastward as though it were a continuation of the\r\nAlps;[2554] and some have even so described it, as well on account of\r\nits position as because it produces the same system of vegetation;\r\nnevertheless, the altitude of this ridge in no part equals that of the\r\nAlps. Here is situated the Hercynian Wood,[2555] and the tribes of the\r\nSuevi,[2556] some of whom inhabit the forest, as do likewise some of the\r\nQuadi.[2557] Among these latter people is situated Bujæmum, the royal\r\ncity of Marobodus, whither he has assembled many strangers and many of\r\nthe Marcomanni, a kindred nation with his own. This Marobodus, from a\r\nprivate station, raised himself to the administration of affairs after\r\nhis return from Rome. For he went to that city while a youth, and was\r\npatronized by Augustus. After he came home, he acquired the sovereignty\r\nof his country, and added to the people I have enumerated, the\r\nLuji,[2558] a powerful nation, and the Zumi,[2559] and the Gutones[2560]\r\nand Mugilones and Sibini, besides the Semnones, another considerable\r\ntribe of the Suevi. As I have previously stated, a portion of the Suevi\r\ndwells within the Forest, while another portion occupies the territory\r\nbeyond, on the frontiers of the Getæ; wherefore the nation of the Suevi\r\nis the most considerable, as it extends from the Rhine as far as the\r\nElbe, and even a part of them, as the Hermonduri and the Langobardi,\r\ninhabit the country beyond the Elbe; but at the present time these\r\ntribes, having been defeated, have retired entirely beyond the Elbe. All\r\nthese nations easily change their abode, on account of the scantiness of\r\nprovisions, and because they neither cultivate the lands nor accumulate\r\nwealth, but dwell in miserable huts, and satisfy their wants from day to\r\nday, the most part of their food being supplied by the herd, as amongst\r\nthe nomade races, and in imitation of them they transfer their\r\nhouseholds in waggons, wandering with their cattle to any place which\r\nmay appear most advantageous. There are many other smaller German\r\ntribes, as the Cherusci, Chatti, Gamabrivi,[2561] Chattuarii, and next\r\nthe ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi,[2562] Bructeri,[2563] Cimbri, Cauci,\r\nCaulci, Campsiani,[2564] and many others.\r\n\r\nIn the same direction with the Ems,[2565] the Weser[2566] and the river\r\nLippe[2567] take their course, the latter, distant about 600 stadia from\r\nthe Rhine, flows through the territory of the Lesser Bructeri. And there\r\nis also the river Sala,[2568] between which and the Rhine Drusus\r\nGermanicus died, whilst in the midst of his victories. He not only\r\nsubdued the greater part of the German tribes, but also the islands on\r\nthe coast he passed along, one amongst which is Byrchanis,[2569] which\r\nhe took by siege.\r\n\r\n4. All these nations became known through their wars with [CAS. 291] the\r\nRomans, at one time submitting, at another revolting and quitting their\r\nhabitations; and we should have become acquainted with a greater number\r\nof their tribes, if Augustus had permitted his generals to pass the\r\nElbe, in pursuit of those who had fled thither; but he considered the\r\nwar on hand would be more easily brought to a conclusion, if he left the\r\npeople on the other side of the Elbe unmolested, and not by attacking\r\nprovoke them to make common cause with his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Sicambri inhabiting the country next the Rhine were the first to\r\ncommence the war, under the conduct of their leader, Melon; other\r\nnations afterwards followed their example, at one time being victorious,\r\nat another defeated, and again recommencing hostilities, without regard\r\nto hostages or the faith of treaties. Against these people mistrust was\r\nthe surest defence; for those who were trusted effected the most\r\nmischief. For example, the Cherusci, and those who were subject to them,\r\namongst whom three Roman legions with their general, Quintilius Varus,\r\nperished by ambush, in violation of the truce; nevertheless all have\r\nreceived punishment for this perfidy, which furnished to Germanicus the\r\nYounger the opportunity of a most brilliant triumph, he leading publicly\r\nas his captives the most illustrious persons, both men and women,\r\namongst whom were Segimuntus,[2570] the son of Segestes, the chief of\r\nthe Cherusci, and his sister, named Thusnelda, the wife of Armenius, who\r\nled on the Cherusci when they treacherously attacked Quintilius Varus,\r\nand even to this day continues the war; likewise his son Thumelicus, a\r\nboy three years old, as also Sesithacus, the son of Segimerus,[2571]\r\nchief of the Cherusci, and his wife Rhamis, the daughter of\r\nUcromirus,[2572] chief of the Chatti,[2573] and Deudorix, the son of\r\nBætorix, the brother of Melon, of the nation of the Sicambri; but\r\nSegestes, the father-in-law of Armenius, from the commencement opposed\r\nthe designs of his son-in-law, and taking advantage of a favourable\r\nopportunity, went over to the Roman camp and witnessed the triumphal\r\nprocession over those who were dearest to him, he being held in honour\r\nby the Romans. There was also led in triumph Libes the priest of the\r\nChatti, and many other prisoners of the various vanquished nations, the\r\nCathylci and the Ampsani, the Bructeri, the Usipi, the Cherusci, the\r\nChatti, the Chattuarii, the Landi,[2574] the Tubattii.[2575]\r\n\r\nThe Rhine is distant from the Elbe about 3000 stadia, if one could\r\ntravel in a direct line; but we are compelled to go a circuitous route,\r\non account of the windings of the marshes and the woods.\r\n\r\n5. The Hercynian Forest[2576] is extremely dense, and overgrown with\r\nvery large trees, covering an immense circuit of country, fortified by\r\nnature. In the midst of it is situated the region well suited for\r\nhabitation, of which we have spoken. Near this forest are the sources of\r\nthe Danube and the Rhine, and the lake[2577] situated between these,\r\ntogether with the marshes formed by the Rhine. The circuit of the lake\r\nis more than 300[2578] stadia, and the distance across about 200. In\r\nthis lake is an island which served Tiberius as an arsenal, in the naval\r\nwar with the Vindelici. This lake is south of the sources of the Danube\r\nand the Hercynian Forest, so that in passing from Keltica[2579] to the\r\nforest, one has first to cross the lake, then the Danube, and afterwards\r\nby a more passable country, and over elevated plains, you approach the\r\nforest. When Tiberius had proceeded but one day’s journey from the lake,\r\nhe came in sight of the sources of the Danube.[2580]\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Rhæti[2581] borders some portion of this lake, but\r\nthe greater part of the shores belong to the Helvetii[2582] [CAS. 292]\r\nand Vindelici,[2583] [the Norici come next after the Vindelici in an\r\neasterly direction,][2584] and the desert of the Boii.[2585] The nations\r\nas far as the Pannonians,[2586] but more especially the Helvetii and\r\nVindelici, inhabit high table lands. The Rhæti and the Norici,[2587]\r\nverging towards Italy, extend over the very summits of the Alps; the\r\nformer confining with the Insubri,[2588] the latter the Carni,[2589] and\r\nthe districts about Aquileia. There is likewise another great forest,\r\nnamed Gabreta, on this side the territory of the Suevi, while beyond\r\nthem lies the Hercynian Wood, which also is in their possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Some of the accounts which we receive respecting the Cimbri are not\r\nworthy of credit, while others seem likely enough: for instance, no one\r\ncould accept the reason given for their wandering life and piracy, that,\r\ndwelling on a peninsula, they were driven out of their settlements by a\r\nvery high tide;[2590] for they still to this day possess the country\r\nwhich they had in former times, and have sent as a present to Augustus\r\nthe caldron held most sacred by them, supplicating his friendship, and\r\nan amnesty for past offences; and having obtained their request, they\r\nreturned home. Indeed, it would have been ridiculous for them to have\r\ndeparted from their country in a pet, on account of a natural and\r\nconstant phenomenon, which recurs twice every day. It is likewise\r\nevidently a fiction, that there ever occurred an overwhelming\r\nflood-tide, for the ocean, in the influences of this kind which it\r\nexperiences, receives a certain settled and periodical increase and\r\ndecrease.[2591] Neither is it true, as has been related,[2592] that the\r\nCimbri take arms against the flood-tides, or that the Kelts, as an\r\nexercise of their intrepidity, suffer their houses to be washed away by\r\nthem, and afterwards rebuild them; and that a greater number of them\r\nperish by water than by war, as Ephorus relates. For the regular order\r\nthe flood-tides observe, and the notoriety of the extent of the country\r\nsubject to inundation by them, could never have given occasion for such\r\nabsurd actions. For the tide flowing twice every day, how could any one\r\nthink for an instant that it was not a natural and harmless phenomenon,\r\nand that it occurs not only on their coasts, but on all others bordering\r\non the ocean? Is not this quite incredible? Neither is Clitarchus to be\r\ntrusted,[2593] when he says that their cavalry, on seeing the sea\r\nflowing in, rode off at full speed, and yet scarcely escaped by flight\r\nfrom being overtaken by the flood; for we know, by experience, that the\r\ntide does not come in with such impetuosity, but that the sea advances\r\nstealthily by slow degrees. And we should think, besides, that a\r\nphenomenon of daily occurrence, which would naturally strike the ear of\r\nsuch as [CAS. 293] approached it, before even they could see it with\r\ntheir eyes, could not by any means terrify them so as to put them to\r\nflight, as if they had been surprised by some unexpected catastrophe.\r\n\r\n2. For such fables as these, Posidonius justly blames these writers, and\r\nnot inaptly conjectures that the Cimbri, on account of their wandering\r\nlife and habits of piracy, might have made an expedition as far as the\r\ncountries around the Palus Mæotis, and that from them has been derived\r\nthe name of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, or what we should more correctly\r\ndenominate the Cimbrian Bosphorus, for the Greeks call the Cimbri\r\nCimmerii.\r\n\r\nHe likewise tells us that the Boii formerly inhabited the Hercynian\r\nForest, and that the Cimbri, having made an incursion into those parts,\r\nwere repulsed by them, and driven towards the Danube, and the country\r\noccupied by the Scordisci, a Galatic tribe, and from thence to the\r\nTauristæ, or Taurisci, a people likewise of Galatic origin, and farther\r\nto the Helvetii, who were at that time a rich and peaceful people; but,\r\nperceiving that the wealth of these freebooters far exceeded their own,\r\nthe Helvetii, and more especially the Tigureni and the Toygeni,\r\nassociated themselves with their expeditions. But both the Cimbri and\r\ntheir auxiliaries were vanquished by the Romans, the one part when they\r\ncrossed the Alps and came down upon Italy, the others on the other side\r\nof the Alps.\r\n\r\n3. It is reported that the Cimbri had a peculiar custom. They were\r\naccompanied in their expeditions by their wives; these were followed by\r\nhoary-headed priestesses,[2594] clad in white, with cloaks of\r\ncarbasus[2595] fastened on with clasps, girt with brazen girdles, and\r\nbare-footed. These individuals, bearing drawn swords, went to meet the\r\ncaptives throughout the camp, and, having crowned them, led them to a\r\nbrazen vessel containing about 20 amphoræ, and placed on a raised\r\nplatform, which one of the priestesses having ascended, and holding the\r\nprisoner above the vessel, cut his throat; then, from the manner in\r\nwhich the blood flowed into the vessel, some drew certain divinations;\r\nwhile others, having opened the corpse, and inspected the entrails,\r\nprophesied victory to their army. In battle too they beat skins\r\nstretched on the wicker sides of chariots, which produces a stunning\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n4. As we have before stated, the northernmost of the Germans inhabit a\r\ncountry bordering on the ocean; but we are only acquainted with those\r\nsituated between the mouths of the Rhine and the Elbe, of which the\r\nSicambri[2596] and Cimbri[2597] are the most generally known: those\r\ndwelling along the coast[2598] beyond the Elbe are entirely unknown to\r\nus; for none of the ancients with whom I am acquainted have prosecuted\r\nthis voyage towards the east as far as the mouths of the Caspian Sea,\r\nneither have the Romans as yet sailed coastwise beyond the Elbe, nor has\r\nany one travelling on foot penetrated farther into this country. But it\r\nis evident, by the _climates_ and the parallels of distances, that in\r\nfollowing a longitudinal course towards the east we must come to the\r\ncountries near the Dnieper, and the regions on the north side of the\r\nEuxine. But as for any particulars as to Germany beyond the Elbe, or of\r\nthe countries which lie beyond it in order, whether we should call them\r\nthe Bastarnæ, as most geographers suppose, or whether other nations\r\nintervene, such as the Jazyges,[2599] or the Roxolani,[2600] or any\r\nothers of the tribes dwelling in waggons, it is not easy to give any\r\naccount. Neither can we say whether these nations extend as far as the\r\n[Northern] Ocean, along the whole distance, or whether [between them and\r\nthe Ocean] there are countries rendered unfit for habitation by the cold\r\nor by any other cause; or whether men of a different race are situated\r\nbetween the sea and the most eastern of the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe same uncertainty prevails with regard to the other [CAS. 294]\r\nnations[2601] of the north, for we know neither the Bastarnæ nor the\r\nSauromatæ;[2602] nor, in a word, any of those tribes situate above the\r\nEuxine: we are ignorant as to what distance they lie from the\r\nAtlantic,[2603] or even whether they extend as far as that sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As to the southern part of Germany beyond the Elbe, the country which\r\nadjoins the bank of that river is now occupied by the Suevi. Next lies\r\nthe country of the Getæ, at first narrow, its southern side extends\r\nalong the Danube, and the opposite side along the mountains of the\r\nHercynian Forest, even including part of those mountains, it then\r\nbecomes broader towards the north, and extends as far as the Tyregetæ;\r\nhowever, we are unable to declare its boundaries with accuracy; and it\r\nis on account of our ignorance of these places that those who relate\r\nfables of the Riphæan mountains and the Hyperboreans have received\r\ncredit; as also that which Pytheas of Marseilles has forged concerning\r\nthe countries bordering on the Northern Ocean, making use of his\r\nacquaintance with astronomy and mathematics to fabricate his false\r\nnarration: let us therefore pass over them; as also what Sophocles,\r\nspeaking of Orithya in one of his tragedies, says, that she, being\r\nsnatched by the north wind, was carried\r\n\r\n   “Over the whole ocean, to the extremities of the earth,\r\n   Even to the place where night received its birth,\r\n   Where the opposite side of the heavens is beheld,\r\n   And where is situated the ancient garden of Phœbus.”\r\n\r\nThis is of no value to our present inquiry, but must be omitted, as\r\nSocrates has done in the Phædrus of Plato. We will relate only what we\r\nhave learnt from ancient accounts, and the reports made in our times.\r\n\r\n2. The Greeks indeed considered the Getæ to be Thracians. They occupied\r\neither bank of the Danube, as also did the Mysians, likewise a Thracian\r\npeople, now called the Mœsi, from whom are descended the Mysians,\r\nsettled between the Lydians, the Phrygians, and the inhabitants of the\r\nTroad. Even the Phrygians themselves are the same as the Briges, a\r\npeople of Thrace, as also are the Mygdones, the Bebryces, the\r\nMædobithyni, the Bithyni, the Thyni, and, as I consider, also are the\r\nMariandyni. All these people quitted Europe entirely, the Mysians alone\r\nremaining. Posidonius appears to me to have rightly conjectured that it\r\nis the Mysians of Europe (or as I should say of Thrace) that Homer\r\ndesignates when he says,\r\n\r\n                         “and his glorious eyes\r\n   Averting, on the land look’d down remote\r\n   Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold\r\n   Close-fighting Mysian race....”[2604]\r\n\r\nFor if any one should understand them as the Mysians of Asia, the\r\nexpression of the poet would not be fitting. For this would be, that\r\nhaving turned his eyes from the Trojans towards the land of the\r\nThracians, he beheld at the same time the land of the Mysians, situated\r\nnot far off from where he was, but conterminous with the Troad, rather\r\nbehind it and on either side, but separated from Thrace by the breadth\r\nof the Hellespont.[2605] This would be to confound the continents, and\r\nat the same time to disregard the form of the poet’s expression. For “to\r\nturn his eyes again,” is more especially to turn them behind him; but he\r\nwho extends his vision from the Trojans to the people either behind\r\nthem, or on either side of them, stretches his sight to a greater\r\ndistance, but not in the least behind him. And this also is introduced\r\nas a proof of this very thing, that Homer classes with these the\r\nHippemolgi,[2606] the Galactophagi,[2607] and the Abii,[2608] who are\r\nthe Scythian Hamaxœci[2609] and Sarmatians; for at this day, all these\r\nnations, as well as the Bastarnæ, are mixed with the Thracians, more\r\nespecially with those beyond the Danube, and some even with [CAS. 296]\r\nthe Thracians on this side the Danube; also amongst these are the Keltic\r\ntribes of the Boii, Scordisci, and Taurisci. Some, indeed, call the\r\nScordisci the Scordistæ, and give to the Taurisci the names of\r\nLigurisci[2610] and Tauristæ.\r\n\r\n3. Posidonius relates that the Mysians religiously abstain from eating\r\nany thing that had life, and consequently, from cattle; but that they\r\nlived in a quiet way on honey, milk, and cheese; wherefore they are\r\nconsidered a religious people, and called Capnobatæ.[2611] He adds, that\r\nthere are amongst the Thracians some who live without wives, and who are\r\nknown by the name of Ctistæ. These are considered sacred and worthy of\r\nhonour, and live in great freedom. [He pretends] that the poet\r\ncomprehends the whole of these people when he says,\r\n\r\n                             “and where abide,\r\n   On milk sustain’d, and blest with length of days,\r\n   The Hippemolgi, justest of mankind.”[2612]\r\n\r\nThese he designates as “without life,” more particularly on account of\r\ntheir living without wives, considering their solitary state as but a\r\nhalf life; in the same way as he likewise designates the house of\r\nProtesilaus “imperfect,” on account of the bereavement of his widow; in\r\nthe same manner he applies to the Mysians the epithet of\r\n“close-fighting,” on account of their being invincible, like good\r\nwarriors. [Finally, Posidonius pretends] that in the thirteenth[2613]\r\nbook of the Iliad we ought to substitute for “the close-fighting\r\nMysians,” [“the close-fighting Mœsi.”]\r\n\r\n4. Nevertheless it would perhaps be superfluous to change the text [of\r\nHomer], which has stood the test of so many years. For it appears more\r\nprobable to suppose that the people were anciently called Mysians, but\r\nthat their name is now altered. Further, any one would suppose that the\r\nAbii[2614] were no more so named from being unmarried than from their\r\nbeing houseless,[2615] or their dwelling in waggons. In fact, as\r\ninjustice is ordinarily committed in matters relative to bonds for money\r\nand the acquisition of wealth, it would be natural that the people\r\nliving so frugally on such small property should be called [by Homer]\r\nthe justest of mankind: and the more so as the philosophers who place\r\njustice next to moderation, aim at independence of others and frugality\r\nas amongst the most desirable objects of attainment; from which however\r\nsome, having passed the bounds of moderation, have wandered into a\r\ncynical mode of life.[2616] But [the words of the poet] sanction no such\r\nassertion of the Thracians, and the Getæ in particular, that they live\r\nwithout wives. But see what Menander says of these people, not out of\r\nhis own imagination, as it should seem, but deriving it from history.\r\n\r\n   “All the Thracians truly, and especially above all others we\r\n   Getæ, (for I myself glory in being descended from this race,) are\r\n   not very chaste.”\r\n\r\nAnd a little after he gives examples of their rage for women.\r\n\r\n   “For there is no one among us who marries fewer than ten or\r\n   eleven wives, and some have twelve, or even more.[2617] If any\r\n   one loses his life who has only married four or five wives, he is\r\n   lamented by us as unfortunate, and one deprived of the pleasures\r\n   of Hymen.”\r\n\r\nSuch a one would be accounted as unmarried amongst them. These things\r\nare likewise confirmed by the evidence of other historians. And it is\r\nnot likely that the same people should regard as an unhappy life that\r\nwhich is passed without the enjoyment of many women, and at the same\r\ntime regard as a dignified and holy life that which is passed in\r\ncelibacy without any women. But that those living without wives should\r\nbe considered holy, and termed Capnobatæ, is entirely opposed to our\r\nreceived opinions; for all agree in regarding women as the authors of\r\ndevotion to the gods, and it is they [CAS. 297] who induce the men by\r\ntheir example to a more attentive worship of the gods, and to the\r\nobservance of feast-days and supplications; for scarcely is there found\r\na man living by himself who pays any regard to such matters. And again\r\nattend to the words of the same poet when he speaks in one of his\r\ncharacters, bringing in a man disgusted with the expenses[2618] of the\r\nsacrifices of the women.\r\n\r\n   “The gods weary us indeed, but especially our married men, who\r\n   are always obliged to celebrate some feast.”\r\n\r\nAnd his Misogynes, complaining of the same things, exclaims,\r\n\r\n   “We sacrificed five times a day, while seven female slaves ranged\r\n   in a circle played on the cymbals, and others raised their\r\n   suppliant cries.”\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem absurd to suppose that only those among the Getæ\r\nwho remained without wives were considered pious, but that the care of\r\nworshipping the Supreme Being is great among this nation is not to be\r\ndoubted, after what Posidonius has related, “and they even abstain from\r\nanimal food from religious motives,” as likewise on account of the\r\ntestimony of other historians.\r\n\r\n5. For it is said that one of the nation of the Getæ, named\r\nZamolxis,[2619] had served Pythagoras, and had acquired with this\r\nphilosopher some astronomical knowledge, in addition to what he had\r\nlearned from the Egyptians, amongst whom he had travelled. He returned\r\nto his own country, and was highly esteemed both by the chief rulers and\r\nthe people, on account of his predictions of astronomical phenomena, and\r\neventually persuaded the king to unite him in the government, as an\r\norgan of the will of the gods. At first he was chosen a priest of the\r\ndivinity most revered by the Getæ, but afterwards was esteemed as a god,\r\nand having retired into a district of caverns, inaccessible and\r\nunfrequented by other men, he there passed his life, rarely\r\ncommunicating with anybody except the king and his ministers. The king\r\nhimself assisted him to play his part, seeing that his subjects obeyed\r\nhim more readily than formerly, as promulgating his ordinances with the\r\ncounsel of the gods. This custom even continues to our time; for there\r\nis always found some one of this character who assists the king in his\r\ncounsels, and is styled a god by the Getæ. The mountain likewise [where\r\nZamolxis retired] is held sacred, and is thus distinguished, being named\r\nCogæonus,[2620] as well as the river which flows by it; and at the time\r\nwhen Byrebistus, against whom divus Cæsar prepared an expedition,\r\nreigned over the Getæ, Decæneus held that honour: likewise the\r\nPythagorean precept to abstain from animal food, which was originally\r\nintroduced by Zamolxis, is still observed to a great extent.\r\n\r\n6. Any one may well entertain such questions as these touching the\r\nlocalities mentioned by the poet [Homer], and with regard to the Mysians\r\nand the illustrious Hippemolgi: but what Apollodorus has advanced in his\r\npreface to the Catalogue of Ships in the Second Book [of the Iliad] is\r\nby no means to be adopted. For he praises the opinions of Eratosthenes,\r\nwho says that Homer and the rest of the ancients were well versed in\r\nevery thing that related to Greece, but were in a state of considerable\r\nignorance as to places at a distance, in consequence of the\r\nimpossibility of their making long journeys by land or voyages by sea.\r\nIn support of this he asserts,[2621] that Homer designated Aulis as\r\n‘rocky,’ as indeed it is; Eteonus as ‘mountainous and woody,’ Thisbe as\r\n‘abounding in doves,’ Haliartus as ‘grassy;’ but that neither Homer nor\r\nthe others were familiar with localities far off; for although there are\r\nforty rivers which discharge themselves into the Black Sea,[2622] he\r\nmakes no mention whatever even of the most considerable, as the\r\nDanube,[2623] the Don,[2624] the Dnieper,[2625] the Bog,[2626] the\r\nPhasz,[2627] the Termeh,[2628] the Kizil-Irmak,[2629] nor does [CAS.\r\n298] he even allude to the Scythians, but makes up fables about certain\r\nillustrious Hippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii. He had become acquainted\r\nwith the Paphlagonians of the interior from the relations of such as had\r\npenetrated into those regions on foot, but he was perfectly unacquainted\r\nwith the sea-coasts of the country; which indeed was likely enough, for\r\nthat sea was in his time closed to navigation, and known by the name of\r\nPontus Axenus [or the Inhospitable] on account of the severity of the\r\nstorms to which it was subject, as well as of the savage disposition of\r\nthe nations who inhabited its shores, but more especially of the\r\nScythian hordes,[2630] who made a practice of sacrificing strangers,\r\ndevouring their flesh, and using their skulls for drinking-cups;\r\nalthough at a subsequent period, when the Ionians had established cities\r\nalong its shores, it was called by the name of Pontus Euxinus [or the\r\nHospitable]. He was likewise in ignorance as to the natural\r\npeculiarities of Egypt and Libya,[2631] as the risings of the Nile, and\r\nthe alluvial deposits, which he no where notices, nor yet the isthmus\r\n[of Suez] which separates the Red Sea from the Egyptian Sea;[2632] nor\r\nyet does he relate any particulars of Arabia, Ethiopia, or the Ocean,\r\nunless we should agree with the philosopher Zeno in altering the Homeric\r\nline as follows,\r\n\r\n   “I came to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Arabians.”[2633]\r\n\r\nIndeed we ought not to be surprised at meeting with this in Homer, for\r\nthose who have lived at a more recent period than he did, have been\r\nignorant of many things, and have told strange tales. Hesiod has talked\r\nof _Hemicynes_,[2634] _Megalocephali_, and _Pygmies_; Alcman of\r\n_Steganopodes_; Æschylus of _Cynocephali_, _Sternophthalmi_, and\r\n_Monommati_, (they say it is in his Prometheus,) and ten thousand other\r\nabsurdities. From these he proceeds to censure the writers who talk of\r\nthe Riphæan Mountains[2635] and Mount Ogyium,[2636] and the dwelling of\r\nthe Gorgons[2637] and the Hesperides,[2638] the land of Meropis[2639]\r\nmentioned by Theopompus, Cimmeris,[2640] a city mentioned in Hecatæus,\r\nthe land of Panchæa[2641] mentioned by Euhemerus, and the river-stones\r\nformed of sand mentioned by Aristotle,[2642] which were dissolved by\r\nrain-showers. Further, that there exists in Africa a city of Bacchus\r\nwhich no one can find twice. He likewise reproves those who assert that\r\nthe wanderings of Ulysses mentioned in Homer were in the neighbourhood\r\nof Sicily, for again, if we should say that the wanderings did take\r\nplace in those parts, we should have to confess that the poet\r\ntransferred them to the ocean for the sake of making his account the\r\nmore romantic. Some allowance might be made for others, but no manner of\r\nexcuse can be put forward for Callimachus, who pretends to the character\r\nof a critic, and yet supposes that Gaudus was the island of Calypso, and\r\nidentifies Scheria with Corcyra.[2643] Other writers he blames for\r\nmisstatements as to Gerena,[2644] Acacesium,[2645] and [CAS. 299] the\r\nDemus[2646] in Ithaca, Pelethronium[2647] in Pelium, and the Glaucopium\r\nat Athens.[2648] With these and a few similar trifling observations,\r\nmost of which he has drawn from Eratosthenes, whose inaccuracy we have\r\nbefore shown, he breaks off. However, we frankly acknowledge, both with\r\nrespect to him [Apollodorus] and Eratosthenes, that the moderns are\r\nbetter informed on geography than the ancients: but to strain the\r\nsubject beyond measure, as they do, especially when they inculpate\r\nHomer, seems to me as if it gave a fair occasion to any one to find\r\nfault, and to say by way of recrimination, that they reproach the poet\r\nfor the very things of which they themselves are ignorant. As for the\r\nrest of their observations, particular mention is made of some of them\r\nin the places where they occur, and of others in the General\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\n7. It has been our wish, while discoursing of the Thracians, and\r\n\r\n                                   “the bold\r\n   Close-fighting Mysian race, and where abide,\r\n   On milk sustain’d, and _blest with length of days_,\r\n   The Hippemolgi, justest of mankind,”[2649]\r\n\r\nto compare what we have advanced with the remarks of Posidonius and the\r\nother critics. Now, in the first place, they have universally proved the\r\nvery contrary of the allegations which they had undertaken to maintain;\r\nfor where they undertook to show that amongst the ancients there was a\r\ngreater amount of ignorance as to places far from Greece than there was\r\namong the moderns, they have proved the very contrary, and that not only\r\nwith regard to the countries more remote, but even with respect to\r\nGreece itself; but, as I have said before, let the other matters remain\r\nin abeyance while we consider carefully the subject now before us. Thus\r\nthey say that it was through ignorance Homer and the ancients omitted to\r\nspeak of the Scythians, and their cruelty to strangers, whom they\r\nsacrificed, devoured their flesh, and afterwards made use of their\r\nskulls as drinking-cups, for which barbarities the sea was termed the\r\nAxine,[2650] or inhospitable; but in place of these they imagined fables\r\nas to illustrious Hippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii, the most just of\r\nmankind, who never existed any where in this world. But how came it that\r\nthey named the sea the Axenus, if they were so ignorant of the barbarism\r\nof that region, or of those savages who were the most barbarous on\r\nearth? But these undoubtedly are the Scythians! Or in the early times\r\nwere not those who dwelt beyond the Mysians, and Thracians, and Getæ,\r\nHippemolgi, (or milkers of mares,) Galactophagi, and Abii? Nay rather,\r\nthey exist at this very day, being called Hamaxœci and Nomades, living\r\non the herd, milk and cheese, and especially on cheese made of mare’s\r\nmilk, and being ignorant how to lay up treasure or deal in merchandise,\r\nexcept the simple barter of one commodity for another. How then can it\r\nbe said that the poet [Homer] knew nothing of the Scythians, since he\r\ndoubtless designates some of them by the names of Hippemolgi and\r\nGalactophagi? And that the men of that [CAS. 300] time called these\r\npeople Hippemolgi even Hesiod is a witness in the words which\r\nEratosthenes has quoted:\r\n\r\n   “He went and saw the Ethiopians, the Ligurians,[2651] and the\r\n   Scythians, milkers of mares.”\r\n\r\nAnd when we consider the amount of fraud connected with trading\r\nspeculations even amongst ourselves, what ground have we to wonder that\r\nHomer should have designated as the justest and most noble those who had\r\nbut few commercial and monetary transactions, and with the exception of\r\ntheir swords and drinking-cups, possessed all things in common, and\r\nespecially their wives and children, who were cared for by the whole\r\ncommunity according to the system of Plato. Æschylus too seems to plead\r\nthe poet’s cause, when he says,\r\n\r\n   “But the Scythians, governed by good laws, and feeding on cheese\r\n   of mares’ milk.”\r\n\r\nAnd this is still the opinion entertained of them by the Greeks; for we\r\nesteem them the most sincere, the least deceitful of any people, and\r\nmuch more frugal and self-relying than ourselves. And yet the manner of\r\nlife customary among us has spread almost every where, and brought about\r\na change for the worse, effeminacy, luxury, and over-great refinement,\r\ninducing extortion in ten thousand different ways; and doubtless much of\r\nthis corruption has penetrated even into the countries of the nomades,\r\nas well as those of the other barbarians; for having once learnt how to\r\nnavigate the sea, they have become depraved, committing piracy and\r\nmurdering strangers; and holding intercourse with many different\r\nnations, they have imitated both their extravagance and their dishonest\r\ntraffic, which may indeed appear to promote civility of manners, but do\r\ndoubtless corrupt the morals and lead to dissimulation, in place of the\r\ngenuine sincerity we have before noticed.\r\n\r\n8. Those however who lived before our time, and more especially those\r\nwho lived near to the times of Homer, were such as he describes them,\r\nand so they were esteemed to be by the Greeks. Take for instance what\r\nHerodotus relates concerning the king[2652] of the Scythians, against\r\nwhom Darius waged war, and especially the answer he sent [to the\r\nmessenger of Darius]. Take again what Chrysippus relates of the kings\r\nof the Bosphorus, [Satyrus[2653] and] Leuco. The letters of the Persians\r\nare full of the sincerity I have described; so likewise are the\r\nmemorials of the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Indians. It was on this\r\naccount that both Anacharsis and Abaris, and certain others of the same\r\nclass, gained so great a reputation among the Greeks; for we may well\r\nbelieve they displayed their national characteristics of affability of\r\nmanner, simplicity, and love of justice. But what occasion is there for\r\nme to speak of such as belonged to the times of old? for Alexander [the\r\nGreat], the son of Philip, in his campaign against the Thracians beyond\r\nMount Hæmus,[2654] is said to have penetrated as far as this in an\r\nincursion into the country of the Triballi, and observed that they\r\noccupied the territory as far as the Danube and the island Peuce,[2655]\r\nwhich is in it, and that the Getæ possessed the country beyond that\r\nriver; however, he was unable to pass into the island for want of a\r\nsufficient number of ships, and because Syrmus, the king of the\r\nTriballi, who had taken refuge in that place, resisted the undertaking:\r\nbut Alexander crossed over into the country of the Getæ and took their\r\ncity, after which he returned home in haste, carrying with him presents\r\nfrom those nations, and also from Syrmus. Ptolemy, the son of Lagus,\r\nrelates that in this campaign the Kelts who dwell on the Adriatic[2656]\r\ncame to Alexander for the purpose of making a treaty of friendship and\r\nmutual hospitality, and that the king received them in a friendly way,\r\nand asked them, while drinking, what might be the chief object of their\r\ndread, supposing that they would say it was he; but that they replied,\r\nit was no man, only they felt some alarm lest the heavens should on some\r\noccasion or other [CAS. 302] fall on them, but that they valued the\r\nfriendship of such a man as him above every thing. These examples\r\nsufficiently manifest the open sincerity of the barbarians, both of the\r\none who would not suffer Alexander to land on the island, but\r\nnevertheless sent presents and concluded a treaty of friendship with\r\nhim, and also of those who asserted that they feared no man, but that\r\nthey valued the friendship of great men above every price.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Dromichætes, who was king of the Getæ in the times of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander, having taken captive Lysimachus, who had come\r\nto wage war against him, showed him his poverty and that of his people,\r\nand likewise their great frugality, bade him not to make war on such,\r\nbut rather seek them as friends; after which he received him as a guest,\r\nmade a treaty of friendship, and suffered him to depart.[2657] [*And\r\nPlato, in his Republic,[2658] considers that the neighbourhood of the\r\nsea ought to be shunned as being productive of vice, and that those who\r\nwould enjoy a well-governed city, should plant it very far from the sea,\r\nand not near it.*][2659]\r\n\r\n9. Ephorus, in the fourth book of his History, which is entitled “Of\r\nEurope,” having gone over Europe as far as the Scythians, concludes by\r\nsaying that there is great difference in the manner of life both of the\r\nSauromatæ and the other Scythians, for while some of them are\r\nexceedingly morose, and are indeed cannibals, others abstain even from\r\nthe flesh of animals. Other historians, he observes, descant upon their\r\nferocity, knowing that the terrible and the wonderful always excite\r\nattention; but they ought also to relate the better features of these\r\npeople, and point to them as a pattern; for his part, he declares he\r\nwill speak of those who excel in the justness of their actions, as there\r\nare some of the nomade Scythians who subsist on mares’ milk, and excel\r\nall men in their justice, these are mentioned by the poets: as Homer,\r\nwhere he says that Jupiter beheld the land\r\n\r\n   “Of the Galactophagi and Abii, justest of mankind;”[2660]\r\n\r\nand Hesiod, in his poem entitled “Travels round the World,” who says\r\nthat Phineus was taken by the Harpies\r\n\r\n   “To the land of the Galactophagi, who have their dwellings\r\n   in waggons.”\r\n\r\nEphorus then proceeds to state the causes of their justice, because they\r\nare frugal in their mode of life, not hoarders of wealth, and just\r\ntowards each other; they possess everything in common, both their women,\r\ntheir children, and the whole of their kin; thus when they come into\r\ncollision with other nations, they are irresistible and unconquered,\r\nhaving no cause for which they need endure slavery. He then cites\r\nChœrilus, who in his “Passage of the Bridge of Boats,” which\r\nDarius[2661] had made, says,\r\n\r\n   “And the sheep-feeding Sacæ, a people of Scythian race, but they\r\n      inhabited\r\n   Wheat-producing Asia: truly they were a colony of the nomades,\r\n   A righteous race.”\r\n\r\nAnd again Ephorus declares of Anacharsis, whom he designates as “The\r\nWise,” that he was sprung from that race; and that he was reckoned as\r\none of the Seven Sages, on account of his pre-eminent moderation and\r\nknowledge. He asserts too that he was the inventor of the bellows, the\r\ndouble-fluked anchor, and the potter’s wheel.[2662] I merely state this,\r\nalthough I know very well that Ephorus is not at all times to be relied\r\non, especially when speaking of Anacharsis; (for how can the wheel be\r\nhis invention, with which Homer, who is anterior to him, was acquainted;\r\n[who says],\r\n\r\n                       “as when, before his wheel\r\n   Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands,” &c.;[2663])\r\n\r\n[CAS. 303] for I wish to show by these references, that there was a\r\ngeneral impression among both the ancients and moderns with regard to\r\nthe nomades, that some were very far removed from the rest of mankind,\r\nthat they subsisted on milk, and were very frugal,[2664] and the most\r\njust of men, and that all this was not the mere invention of Homer.\r\n\r\n10. It is but just too that Apollodorus should give some explanation\r\nrespecting the Mysians mentioned in the Epic poems of Homer, whether he\r\ntakes them to be but people of his feigning, when the poet says,\r\n\r\n   “Of the close-fighting Mysians and the illustrious Hippemolgi,”[2665]\r\n\r\nor would he regard them as the Mysians of Asia? Now if he should declare\r\nthat he considers them to be those of Asia, he will misinterpret the\r\npoet, as has been before observed; but if he should say they were but an\r\ninvention, as there were no Mysians in Thrace, he will be guilty of a\r\npalpable misstatement, for even in our own times Ælius Catus has removed\r\nfrom the opposite side of the Danube into Thrace fifty thousand Getæ,\r\nwho speak a language cognate with the Thracian. They still inhabit the\r\nvery spot, and pass by the name of Mœsi. Whether those of former times\r\nwere so designated, and had their name slightly varied in Asia, or, as\r\nis more suitable to history and the poet’s expression, those in Thrace\r\nwere at the first called Mysians,[2666] is not certain. But enough of\r\nthis; we must now return to our geography.\r\n\r\n11. Let us pass over the early history of the Getæ, and occupy ourselves\r\nwith their actual condition. Bœrebistas, one of the Getæ, having taken\r\nthe command of his tribe, reanimated the men who were disheartened by\r\nfrequent wars, and raised them to such a degree of training, sobriety,\r\nand a habit of obedience to orders, that he established a powerful\r\ndominion within a few years, and brought most of the neighbouring states\r\ninto subjection to the Getæ. He at length became formidable even to the\r\nRomans, fearlessly crossing the Danube, and laying waste Thrace as far\r\nas Macedonia and Illyria; he also subdued the Kelts who live among the\r\nThracians and Illyrians, and thoroughly annihilated the Boii who were\r\nsubject to Critasirus and the Taurisci. In order to maintain the\r\nobedience of his subjects, he availed himself of the assistance of\r\nDecæneus a sorcerer,[2667] who had travelled in Egypt, and who, by\r\npredictions he had learnt to draw from certain natural signs, was\r\nenabled to assume the character of an oracle, and was almost held in the\r\nveneration of a god, as we have related when noticing Zamolxis.[2668] As\r\nan instance of their implicit obedience, we may relate that they were\r\npersuaded to root up their vines and live without wine. However,\r\nBœrebistas was murdered in a sedition before the Romans sent an army\r\nagainst him. Those who succeeded to his government divided it into\r\nseveral states. Lately, when Augustus Cæsar sent an army against them,\r\nthey were divided into five states, at another time they were four, for\r\nsuch divisions are but temporary in duration, and variable in their\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n12. There was, from ancient times, another division of these people\r\nwhich still exists; thus, some they call Dacians and others Getæ: the\r\nGetæ extend towards the Euxine and the east, but the Dacians are\r\nsituated on the opposite side towards Germany and the sources of the\r\nDanube,[2669] whom I consider to have been called Daci from a very early\r\nperiod. Whence also amongst the Attics the names of Getæ and Davi were\r\ncustomary for slaves. This at least is more probable than to consider\r\nthem as taken from the Scythians who are named Daæ,[2670] for they live\r\nfar beyond Hyrcania,[2671] and it is not likely that slaves would be\r\nbrought all that way into Attica. It was usual with them to call their\r\nslaves after the name of the nation from whence they were brought, as\r\nLydus and Syrus,[2672] or else by a name much in use in their own\r\ncountry, as, for a Phrygian, Manes or Midas; for a Paphlagonian, Tibius.\r\nThe nation which was raised to so much power by Bœrebistas has since\r\nbeen completely reduced by [CAS. 304] civil dissensions and contests\r\nwith the Romans; however, they are still able to set out 40,000 men\r\narmed for the wars.\r\n\r\n13. The river Maros[2673] flows through their country into the\r\nDanube,[2674] on which the Romans transported their military stores; for\r\nthus they termed the upper part of that river from its sources to the\r\ncataracts, which flows chiefly through the country of the Dacians, but\r\nthe part below that point which flows through the country of the Getæ as\r\nfar as the Black Sea, they call the Ister.[2675] The Dacians speak the\r\nsame language as the Getæ. The Getæ are best known among the Greeks on\r\naccount of the frequent wandering expeditions they make on both sides of\r\nthe Danube, and their being mixed among the Thracians and Mysians. The\r\nlike is the case with regard to the nation of the Triballi, a Thracian\r\npeople; for they have received many refugees on occasions when their\r\nmore powerful neighbours have driven out the weaker, for from time to\r\ntime the Scythians of the opposite side of the river, and the Bastarnæ,\r\nand the Sarmatians,[2676] become victorious, and those who are driven\r\nout cross over and some of them take up their residence either in the\r\nislands of the river or in Thrace, while on the other side the\r\ninhabitants are distressed by the Illyrians. At one time when the Getæ\r\nand the Dacians had increased to the greatest numbers, they were able to\r\nset on foot an army of two hundred thousand men, but now they are\r\nreduced to about forty thousand men, and are even likely to become\r\nsubject to the Romans; still they are not yet quite under their sway on\r\naccount of their trust in the Germans, who are enemies to the Romans.\r\n\r\n14. Between [the Getæ and] the Black Sea, from the Danube to the\r\nDniester,[2677] lies the desert of the Getæ.[2678] It is entirely a\r\nplain and destitute of water. It was there that Darius the son of\r\nHystaspes, at the time he crossed the Danube, was in danger of being cut\r\noff with his whole army for want of water; this he found out before it\r\nwas too late, and returned. At a subsequent period, when Lysimachus was\r\nwaging war against the Getæ and their king Dromichætes, he not only\r\nincurred the risk,[2679] but he fell into the hands of the enemy; but\r\nhis life was spared by the courtesy of the barbarian, as I have before\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n15. Near the mouths of the Danube is the large island called\r\nPeuce.[2680] This the Bastarnæ possessed, and were hence called Peucini.\r\nThere are also other islands much smaller, some above this, and others\r\nnearer the sea. The Danube has seven mouths, the largest is called the\r\nSacred Mouth,[2681] the passage by which to Peuce is 120 stadia.[2682]\r\nAt the lower part of this island Darius made his bridge. It might\r\nlikewise have been constructed at the upper part. This is the first\r\nmouth on the left-hand side as you sail into the Black Sea; the rest are\r\npassed while sailing along towards the Dniester; the seventh mouth is\r\ndistant from this first mouth about 300 stadia. These mouths form\r\nseveral islands. The first three mouths next after the Sacred Mouth are\r\nbut small, the remainder are much less than it, but greater than any of\r\nthe three. Ephorus states that the Danube has five mouths. From hence to\r\nthe Dniester,[2683] which is a navigable river, there are 900\r\nstadia.[2684] In the district intervening there are two great lakes; one\r\nis open to the sea, and is used as a harbour,[2685] the other has no\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\n16. At the mouth of the Dniester there is a tower called the Tower of\r\nNeoptolemus, and a village called Hermōnax.[2686] As you sail up the\r\nriver 140 stadia, there are cities on both sides; the one is\r\nNiconia,[2687] and that on the left Ophiussa.[2688] Those who dwell on\r\nthe spot say that the city is but 120 stadia [CAS. 306] up the river.\r\nThe island of Leuce[2689] is distant from the river’s mouth a course of\r\n500 stadia; it is quite in the sea, and is sacred to Achilles.\r\n\r\n17. Next is the Dnieper,[2690] a river navigable to the distance of\r\n600[2691] stadia, and near to it another river, the Bog,[2692] and an\r\nisland[2693] lying before the mouth of the Dnieper, which possesses a\r\nhaven. After sailing up the Borysthenes[2694] 200 stadia, you come to\r\nthe city of like name with the river, which is likewise called\r\nOlbia;[2695] it is a great emporium and a foundation of the Milesians.\r\nOf the region lying inland from the coast we have described between the\r\nDnieper and the Danube, the first portion is the Desert of the Getæ,\r\nthen comes the Tyregetæ, after them the Jazyges Sarmatæ, and the\r\nBasilii, who are also called Urgi.[2696] Most of these people are\r\nnomades. However, a few of them pay attention to agriculture. These are\r\nsaid to inhabit the banks of the Danube, frequently even on both sides\r\nof the river. In the inland the Bastarnæ dwell, and confine with the\r\nTyregetæ and the Germans; indeed, they may almost be said to be of the\r\nGerman stock. They are divided into many tribes, as some are called\r\nAtmoni, some Sidones, those who inhabit the island Peuce[2697] in the\r\nDanube, Peucini, and the most northern, Roxolani.[2698] These latter\r\ndepasture the plains lying between the Don[2699] and the Dnieper.\r\nIndeed the whole of the northern regions with which we are acquainted,\r\nfrom Germany to the Caspian, is an extended plain. Whether any dwell\r\nstill farther than the Roxolani is unknown to us. However, the Roxolani\r\nfought against the generals of Mithridates Eupator. Their leader was\r\nTasius. They came as allies of Palacus, the son of Scilurus, and were\r\nconsidered good soldiers, but against the serried and well-armed phalanx\r\nevery barbarous and light-armed tribe is ineffective. Thus they,\r\nalthough numbering fifty thousand men, could not withstand the six\r\nthousand arrayed by Diophantus, the general of Mithridates, but were\r\nalmost all cut to pieces. They make use of helmets and breastplates made\r\nof untanned ox-hide. They bear wicker shields; and as weapons, lances,\r\nthe bow, and the sword, such as most of the other barbarians do. The\r\nwoollen tents of the nomades are fixed upon their chariots, in which\r\nthey pass their lives. Their herds are scattered round their tents, and\r\nthey live on the milk, the cheese, and the meat which they supply. They\r\nshift their quarters ever in search of pasture, changing the places they\r\nhave exhausted for others full of grass. In the winter they encamp in\r\nthe marshes near the Palus Mæotis,[2700] and in the summer on the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\n18. The whole of this country, which reaches to the sea-coast extending\r\nfrom the Dnieper[2701] to the Palus Mæotis, is subject to severe\r\nwinters; so also are the most northern of the districts bordering on the\r\nsea, as the mouth of the Palus Mæotis, and farther that of the Dnieper\r\nand the head of the Gulf of Tamyraca, or Carcinites,[2702] which washes\r\nthe isthmus[2703] of the Magna Chersonesus. The intense cold of the\r\ndistricts inhabited, notwithstanding their being plains, is manifest,\r\nfor they rear no asses, as that animal is too susceptible of cold; some\r\nof their oxen are without horns by nature, of the others they file off\r\nthe horns, as a part most susceptible of injury from cold. Their horses\r\nare diminutive and their sheep large. Their brazen vessels are split\r\nwith the frosts, and their contents frozen into a solid mass. However,\r\nthe rigour of the frosts may be best illustrated by the phænomena which\r\nare [CAS. 307] common in the neighbourhood of the embouchure of the Palus\r\nMæotis;[2704] for the passage from Panticapæum,[2705] across to\r\nPhanagoria,[2706] is at times performed in waggons, thus being both a\r\nsea passage[2707] and an overland route [as the season may determine].\r\nThere are also fish which are taken in the ice by means of a round net\r\ncalled a gangama, and especially a kind of sturgeon called\r\nantacæus,[2708] nearly the size of a dolphin. It is related that\r\nNeoptolemus, the general of Mithridates,[2709] defeated the barbarians\r\nduring summer-time in a naval engagement in this very strait, and during\r\nthe winter in a cavalry action. They say that about the Bosphorus the\r\nvine is hidden away in the earth in winter, great mounds of mould being\r\npiled over it [to preserve it from the frost]. They also report that the\r\nheats are excessive, [this may be accounted for in several ways,]\r\nperhaps men’s bodies not being accustomed to them, feel them the more;\r\nperhaps the plains are at that time unrefreshed by winds; or perhaps the\r\nthickness of the air is heated to a great degree, similar to the way in\r\nwhich the misty air is affected in times when a parhelion is observed.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Ateas,[2710] who carried on war against Philip,[2711]\r\nthe son of Amyntas, had the rule over most of the barbarians of these\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n19. After the island[2712] situated opposite the mouth of the Dnieper,\r\nin sailing towards the east, we arrive at the cape of the Course of\r\nAchilles.[2713] The district is quite bare, notwithstanding that it is\r\ntermed a wood. It is sacred to Achilles. Then we arrive at the Course of\r\nAchilles, a low peninsula; for it is a certain tongue of land about a\r\nthousand stadia in length, running out towards the east, and its width\r\nis but two stadia[2714] in the broadest part, and but four\r\nplethra[2715] in the narrowest. It is distant from the mainland, which\r\nruns out on both sides of the neck, about 60 stadia. It is sandy, but\r\nwater is obtainable by digging. About the midst of the Course of\r\nAchilles[2716] is the neck of the isthmus [joining it to the mainland].\r\nIt is about 40 stadia in breadth, and terminates in a headland which\r\nthey call Tamyraca.[2717] This possesses an anchorage opposite the\r\nmainland. Next comes the Gulf Carcinites, which is of considerable\r\nextent, reaching towards the north[2718] about 1000 stadia. Some affirm\r\nthat it is three times that distance to the head of the gulf ... are\r\ncalled Taphrii. They likewise call the Gulf Carcinites the Gulf\r\nTamyraca, the same as the headland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. At the bottom of the bay (Carcinites) commences the isthmus[2719]\r\nwhich separates the lake called Sapra, [or the Putrid Lake,] from the\r\nsea; it is 40 stadia in width, and forms the [CAS. 308] Tauric or\r\nScythian Chersonese.[2720] This, according to some, is 360 stadia\r\nacross. The Putrid Lake[2721] is said to extend 4000 stadia (in\r\ncircumference), and forms part of the [Palus] Mæotis on its western\r\nside, with which it communicates by a large opening. It abounds in\r\nmarshy tracts, and is scarcely navigable with “sewn”[2722] boats. The\r\nshallower parts are soon uncovered, and again covered with water, by the\r\nforce of the wind; but the marsh will not bear boats of a deeper\r\ndraught. In the bay are three small islands; and in sailing along the\r\ncoast, some shallows are met with, and rocks which rise above water.\r\n\r\n2. On the left in sailing out of the bay [Carcinites] there is a small\r\ntown and another harbour[2723] belonging to the people of the\r\nChersonese; for in coasting along the bay, there projects towards the\r\nsouth a large promontory, which is a part of the great Chersonese. Upon\r\nit stands a city of the Heracleotæ, who are a colony from Heraclea[2724]\r\nin the Euxine; it bears the same name, Chersonesus, as the territory. It\r\nis distant from the Dniester,[2725] in following the coast, 4400 stadia.\r\nIn this city is a temple of the Virgin, some goddess,[2726] after whom\r\nthe promontory, which is in front of the city, at the distance of 100\r\nstadia, is called Parthenium. It has a shrine of the goddess and a\r\nstatue. Between the city[2727] and the promontory are three harbours;\r\nnext is the old city Chersonesus in ruins; then follows a harbour with a\r\nnarrow entrance. It was called Symbolon Limen, or Signal Harbour; and\r\nhere principally was carried on a system of piracy against those who\r\ntook refuge in the ports. This, together with another harbour, called\r\nCtenus,[2728] forms an isthmus of 40 stadia in extent. This isthmus\r\nlocks in the Smaller Chersonesus, which we said was a part of the Great\r\nChersonesus, having on it a city of the same name.\r\n\r\n3. It was formerly governed by its own laws, but after it was ravaged by\r\nbarbarous nations, the inhabitants were obliged to elect as their\r\nprotector, Mithridates Eupator, who was anxious to direct his forces\r\nagainst the barbarians who lived above the isthmus, and occupied the\r\ncountry as far as the Dnieper and the Adriatic, and thus to prepare\r\nhimself against war with the Romans. Mithridates, with these views,\r\nreadily despatched an expedition into the Chersonesus, and carried on\r\nwar at the same time against the Scythians, Scilurus, and the sons of\r\nScilurus, namely, Palacus and his brothers, whom Posidonius reckons to\r\nhave been fifty, and Apollonides eighty, in number. By the subjugation\r\nof these enemies he became at once master of the Bosporus, which\r\nPairisades, who held the command of it, voluntarily surrendered. From\r\nthat time to the present the city of the Chersonitæ has been subject to\r\nthe princes of the Bosporus.\r\n\r\nCtenus is equally distant from the city of the Chersonitæ, and from\r\nSymbolon Limen. From Symbolon Limen the Tauric coast extends 1000 stadia\r\nto the city Theodosia.[2729] The coast is rugged and mountainous, and\r\nduring the prevalence of the north winds, tempestuous. From this coast a\r\npromontory projects far into the sea, and stretches out southwards\r\ntowards Paphlagonia, and the city Amastris. It is called Criu-metopon,\r\nor Ram’s Head. Opposite to it is [CAS. 309] Carambis,[2730] the\r\npromontory of the Paphlagonians. Criu-metopon and Carambis together form\r\na strait compressed between them, and divide the Euxine into two parts.\r\nCarambis is distant from the city of the Chersonesus 2500 stadia, and\r\nfrom Criu-metopon much less; for many persons who have sailed through\r\nthe strait say, that they saw both promontories at once.[2731]\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous district of the Tauri there is a hill called\r\nTrapezus,[2732] of the same name as the city,[2733] which is near\r\nTibarania and Colchis. There is another hill also, the Kimmerium,[2734]\r\nin the same mountainous district, for the Kimmerii were once sovereigns\r\nof the Bosporus, and hence the whole of the strait at the mouth of the\r\n[Palus] Mæotis is called the Kimmerian Bosporus.\r\n\r\n4. After leaving the above-mentioned mountainous district, is the city\r\nTheodosia, situated on a plain; the soil is fertile, and there is a\r\nharbour capable of containing a hundred vessels. This formerly was the\r\nboundary of the territory of the Bosporians and of the Tauri. Then\r\nfollows a fertile country extending to Panticapæum,[2735] the capital of\r\nthe Bosporians, which is situated at the mouth of the Palus\r\nMæotis.[2736] Between Theodosia[2737] and Panticapæum there is a tract\r\nof about 530 stadia in extent. The whole country is corn-producing;\r\nthere are villages in it, and a city called Nymphæum, with a good\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nPanticapæum is a hill inhabited all round for a circuit of 20 stadia. To\r\nthe east it has a harbour, and docks capable of containing about thirty\r\nvessels; there is also an acropolis. It was founded by the Milesians.\r\nBoth this place and the neighbouring settlements on each side of the\r\nmouth of the Palus Mæotis were for a long period under the monarchical\r\ndynasty of Leucon, and Satyrus, and Pairisades, till the latter\r\nsurrendered the sovereignty to Mithridates. They had the name of\r\ntyrants, although most of them were moderate and just in their\r\ngovernment, from the time of Pairisades and Leucon. Pairisades was\r\naccounted even a god. The last sovereign, whose name was also\r\nPairisades, being unable to resist the barbarians, by whom great and\r\nunusual tributes were exacted, surrendered the kingdom into the hands of\r\nMithridates. After him it became subject to the Romans. The greater\r\nportion of it is situated in Europe, but a part of it is also situated\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\n5. The mouth of the [Palus] Mæotis is called the Kimmerian Bosporus. The\r\nentrance, which at the broadest part is about 70 stadia across, where\r\nthere is a passage from the neighbourhood[2738] of Panticapæum to\r\nPhanagoria, the nearest city in Asia. The [Palus] Mæotis closes in an\r\narm of the sea which is much narrower. This arm of the sea and the\r\nDon[2739] separate Europe from Asia. Then the Don flows from the north\r\nopposite into the lake, and into the Kimmerian Bosporus. It discharges\r\nitself into the lake by two mouths,[2740] which are distant from each\r\nother about 60 stadia. There is also a city of the same name as the\r\nriver; and next to Panticapæum it is the largest mart belonging to the\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nOn sailing into the Kimmerian Bosporus,[2741] on the left hand is\r\nMyrmecium,[2742] a small city, 20 stadia from Panticapæum, and 40 stadia\r\nfrom Parthenium;[2743] it is a village where is the narrowest entrance\r\ninto the lake, about 20 stadia in breadth; opposite to it is a village\r\nsituated in Asia, called Achilleum. Thence to the Don, and to the island\r\nat its mouths, is a voyage in a direct line of 2200 stadia. The distance\r\nis somewhat greater if the voyage is performed along the coast of Asia,\r\nbut taking the left-hand side, (in which direction the isthmus of the\r\nChersonese is fallen in with,) the distance is more than tripled. This\r\nlatter course is along the desert shore of Europe, but the [CAS. 311]\r\nAsiatic side is not without inhabitants. The whole circumference of the\r\nlake is 9000 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe Great Chersonesus resembles Peloponnesus both in figure and size.\r\nThe kings of the Bosporus possess it, but the whole country has been\r\ndevastated by continual wars. They formerly possessed a small tract only\r\nat the mouth of the [Palus] Mæotis near Panticapæum, extending as far as\r\nTheodosia. The largest part of the territory, as far as the isthmus and\r\nthe Gulf Carcinites, was in possession of the Tauri, a Scythian nation.\r\nThe whole of this country, comprehending also a portion on the other\r\nside of the isthmus as far as the Dnieper, was called Little Scythia. In\r\nconsequence of the number of people who passed from thence across the\r\nDniester and the Danube, and settled there, no small part of that\r\ncountry also bore the name of Little Scythia. The Thracians surrendered\r\na part of it to superior force, and a part was abandoned on account of\r\nthe bad quality of the ground, a large portion of which is marshy.\r\n\r\n6. Except the mountainous tract of the Chersonesus on the sea-coast,\r\nextending as far as Theodosia, all the rest consist of plains, the soil\r\nof which is rich, and remarkably fertile in corn. It yields thirty-fold,\r\nwhen turned up by the most ordinary implements of husbandry. The tribute\r\npaid to Mithridates by the inhabitants, including that from the\r\nneighbourhood of Sindace in Asia, amounted to 180,000 medimni of corn,\r\nand 200 talents of silver. The Greeks in former times imported from this\r\ncountry corn, and the cured fish of Palus Mæotis. Leucon is said to have\r\nsent to the Athenians 2,100,000 medimni of corn from Theodosia.[2744]\r\n\r\nThe name of Georgi, or husbandmen, was appropriately given to these\r\npeople, to distinguish them from the nations situated above them, who\r\nare nomades, and live upon the flesh of horses and other animals, on\r\ncheese of mares’ milk, milk, and sour milk. The latter, prepared in a\r\npeculiar manner, is a delicacy.[2745] Hence the poet designates all the\r\nnations in that quarter as Galactophagi, milk-eaters.\r\n\r\nThe nomades are more disposed to war than to robbery. The occasion of\r\ntheir contests was to enforce the payment of tribute. They permit those\r\nto have land who are willing to cultivate it. In return for the use of\r\nthe land, they are satisfied with receiving a settled and moderate\r\ntribute, not such as will furnish superfluities, but the daily\r\nnecessaries of life. If this tribute is not paid, the nomades declare\r\nwar. Hence the poet calls these people both just, and miserable,\r\n(Abii,)[2746] for if the tribute is regularly paid, they do not have\r\nrecourse to war. Payment is not made by those, who have confidence in\r\ntheir ability to repel attacks with ease, and to prevent the incursion\r\nof their enemies. This course was pursued, as Hypsicrates relates, by\r\nAsander, who fortified on the isthmus of the Chersonesus, at the Palus\r\nMæotis, a space of 360 stadia, and erected towers at the distance of\r\nevery 10 stadia.[2747]\r\n\r\nThe Georgi (husbandmen) are considered to be more civilized and mild in\r\ntheir manners than the other tribes in this quarter, but they are\r\naddicted to gain. They navigate the sea, and do not abstain from piracy,\r\nnor from similar acts of injustice and rapacity.\r\n\r\n7. Besides the places in the Chersonesus already enumerated, there are\r\nthe fortresses Palacium, and Chabum, and Neapolis,[2748] which Scilurus\r\nand his sons constructed, from which they sallied out against the\r\ngenerals of Mithridates.\r\n\r\nThere was also a fortress called Eupatorium, built by Diophantus, one of\r\nthe generals of Mithridates.[2749]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 312] There is a promontory, distant about 15 stadia from the wall\r\nof Chersonesus, which forms a large bay, which bends towards the city.\r\nAbove this bay is a sea-lake, where there are salt pits. Here was the\r\nharbour Ctenus. The generals of the king, in order to strengthen their\r\nmeans of resistance in case of siege, stationed a garrison on the\r\nabove-mentioned promontory, which was further protected by a\r\nfortification. The mouth of the Gulf was closed by an embankment which\r\nextended to the city, and was easily traversed on foot. The garrison and\r\nthe city were thus united. The Scythians were afterwards easily\r\nrepulsed. They attacked that part of the wall built across the isthmus\r\nwhich touches upon Ctenus, and filled the ditch with straw. The kind of\r\nbridge thus formed by day, was burnt at night by the king’s generals,\r\nwho continued their resistance and defeated the enemy. At present the\r\nwhole country is subject to whomsoever the Romans may appoint as king of\r\nthe Bosporus.\r\n\r\n8. It is a custom peculiar to all the Scythian and Sarmatian tribes, to\r\ncastrate their horses, in order to make them more tractable, for\r\nalthough they are small, yet they are spirited, and difficult to manage.\r\nStags and wild boars are hunted in the marshes, and wild asses and\r\nroes[2750] in the plains. It is a peculiarity of this country, that no\r\neagles are to be found in it. Among the quadrupeds there is an animal\r\ncalled Colus, in size between a deer and a ram; it is white, and swifter\r\nin speed than either of those animals. It draws up water into the head\r\nthrough the nostrils; from this store it can supply itself for several\r\ndays, and live without inconvenience in places destitute of water.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the whole of the country beyond the Danube, lying\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Don, and extending as far as the Pontic Sea\r\nand the Palus Mæotis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There remains to be described that part of Europe included between\r\nthe Danube and the sea which surrounds it, beginning from the inner\r\nrecess of the Adriatic, and extending to the Sacred mouth of the Danube.\r\n\r\nThis part contains Greece, Macedonia, Epirus, and the people who live\r\nabove them, extending to the Danube and to the two seas (the Adriatic\r\nand the Euxine Sea) on each side. On the Adriatic are the Illyrians; on\r\nthe Euxine Sea, as far as the Propontis[2751] and Hellespont, are the\r\nThracians, and the Scythian or Keltic tribes intermixed with them. We\r\nmust begin from the Danube, and treat of the countries which follow next\r\nin order to those already described, that is to say, the parts\r\ncontiguous to Italy, the Alps, the Germans, the Dacians, and the Getæ.\r\n\r\nThese may be divided into two parts. For the mountains of Illyria,\r\nPæonia, and Thrace, may be considered as forming, as it were, a single\r\nline, parallel to the Danube, and extending from the Adriatic to the\r\nEuxine. To the north of this line is the country included between the\r\nDanube and the mountains. To the south is Greece and the barbarous tract\r\ncontiguous to these mountains.\r\n\r\nNear the Euxine Sea is Mount Hæmus,[2752] the largest and the highest of\r\nthe mountains in that quarter, and divides Thrace nearly in the middle.\r\nAccording to Polybius, both seas may be seen from this mountain; but he\r\nis mistaken, for the distance to the Adriatic is considerable, and many\r\nthings obstruct the view.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of Ardia[2753] lies near the Adriatic, Pæonia is in the\r\nmiddle, and all this country consists of elevated ground. On the side\r\ntowards Thrace, it is bounded by Rhodope,[2754] a mountain next in\r\nheight to Hæmus; on the other side to the north is Illyria, and the\r\ncountry of the Autariatæ,[2755] and Dardania.[2756]\r\n\r\nI shall first describe Illyria, which approaches close to the Danube,\r\nand to the Alps which lie between Italy and Germany, [CAS. 314] taking\r\ntheir commencement from the lake in the territory of the Vindelici,\r\nRhæti, and Helvetii.[2757]\r\n\r\n2. The Daci depopulated a part of this country in their wars with the\r\nBoii and Taurisci, Keltic tribes whose chief was Critasirus. The Daci\r\nclaimed the country, although it was separated from them by the river\r\nParisus,[2758] which flows from the mountains to the Danube, near the\r\nGalatæ Scordisci, a people who lived intermixed with the Illyrian and\r\nthe Thracian tribes. The Illyrians were destroyed by the Daci, while the\r\nScordisci were frequently their allies.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the country as far as Segestica,[2759] and the Danube,\r\ntowards the north and east, is occupied by Pannonii, but they extend\r\nfarther in an opposite direction. The city Segestica, belonging to the\r\nPannonii, is situated at the confluence of several rivers, all of which\r\nare navigable. It is in a convenient situation for carrying on war\r\nagainst the Daci, for it lies at the foot of the Alps, which extend to\r\nthe Iapodes,[2760] a mixed Keltic and Illyrian tribe. Thence also flow\r\nthe rivers by which is conveyed to Segestica a great quantity of\r\nmerchandise, and among the rest, commodities from Italy. The distance\r\nfrom Aquileia to Nauportus,[2761] a settlement of the Taurisci, across\r\nthe mountain Ocra,[2762] is 350, or, according to some writers, 500\r\nstadia. Merchandise is transported to Nauportus in waggons. The Ocra is\r\nthe lowest part of the Alps, which extend from Rhætica to the Iapodes,\r\nwhere the mountains rise again, and are called Albii. From\r\nTergeste,[2763] a village of the Carni,[2764] there is a pass across and\r\nthrough the Ocra to a marsh called Lugeum.[2765] A river, the Corcoras,\r\nflows near Nauportus, and conveys the merchandise from that place. It\r\ndischarges itself into the Save, and this latter river into the\r\nDrave; the Drave again into the Noarus at Segestica. Here the Noarus,\r\nhaving received the Colapis[2766] as it descends in its full stream from\r\nthe mountain Albius through the Iapodes, enters the Danube among the\r\nScordisci. The navigation on the rivers is in general towards the north.\r\nThe journey from Tergeste to the Danube is about 1200 stadia. Near\r\nSegestica is Siscia, a strong-hold, and Sirmium, both situated on the\r\nroad to Italy.\r\n\r\n3. The Breuci, Andizetii, Ditiones, Peirustæ, Mazæi, Daisitiatæ, whose\r\nchief was Baton, and other small obscure communities, which extend to\r\nDalmatia, and almost to the Ardiæi to the south, are Pannonians. The\r\nwhole mountainous tract from the recess of the Adriatic bay to the\r\nRhizonic gulf,[2767] and to the territory of the Ardiæi, intervening\r\nbetween the sea and Pannonia, forms the coast of Illyria.\r\n\r\nHere perhaps we ought to begin an uninterrupted account of these places,\r\nafter a short repetition.\r\n\r\nIn describing Italy we said, that the Istri were the first nation on the\r\nIllyrian coast, contiguous to Italy and to the Carni, and that the\r\npresent government had advanced the limits of Italy to Pola,[2768] a\r\ncity of Istria. These limits are distant about 800 stadia from the\r\nrecess of the bay. It is the same distance from the promontory in front\r\nof Pola to Ancon,[2769] keeping Henetica[2770] on the right hand. The\r\nwhole voyage along the coast of Istria is 1300 stadia.\r\n\r\n4. Next is the voyage along the coast of the Iapodes, 1000 stadia in\r\nextent. The Iapodes are situated on Mount Albius, which is the\r\ntermination of the Alps, and is of very great height. They reach in one\r\ndirection to the Pannonii and the Danube, and in another to the\r\nAdriatic. They are a warlike people, but were completely subdued by\r\nAugustus. Their cities are Metulum, Arupinum, Monetium, Vendum.[2771]\r\nThe country is poor, and the inhabitants live chiefly upon spelt and\r\nmillet.[2772] Their armour is after the Keltic fashion. Their bodies are\r\npunctured, like those of the other Illyrian and Thracian people.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 315] After the coast of the Iapodes follows that of Liburnia,\r\nexceeding the former by 500 stadia. On this coast is Scardon,[2773] a\r\nLiburnian city, and a river,[2774] which is navigable for vessels of\r\nburden as far as the Dalmatæ.\r\n\r\n5. Islands are scattered along the whole of the above-mentioned coast;\r\namong them are the Apsyrtides, where Medea is said to have killed her\r\nbrother Apsyrtus, who was pursuing her.\r\n\r\nNear the Iapodes is Cyrictica,[2775] then the Liburnian islands, about\r\nforty in number; other islands follow, of which the best known are Issa,\r\nTragurium, founded by Isseans; Pharos, formerly Paros, founded by\r\nParians, the birth-place of Demetrius, the Pharian; then the coast of\r\nthe Dalmatæ and their naval arsenal, Salon.[2776] This nation was for a\r\nlong time at war with the Romans. They had fifty considerable\r\nsettlements, some of which were in the rank of cities, as Salon,\r\nPriomon, Ninias, and the old and new Sinotium. Augustus burnt them down.\r\nThere is also Andetrium, a strong fortress, and Dalmatium, a large city,\r\nof the same name as the nation. Scipio Nasica greatly reduced its size,\r\nand converted the plain into a pasture for sheep, on account of the\r\ndisposition of the people to rob and pillage.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom peculiar to the Dalmatæ to make a partition of their\r\nlands every eighth year. They do not use money, which is a peculiarity\r\nalso when compared with the habits of the other inhabitants of this\r\ncoast; but this is common among many other tribes of barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe mountain Adrion divides Dalmatia into two parts, one of which is on\r\nthe sea, the other forms the opposite side of the mountain. Then follow\r\nthe river Naron, and the people in the neighbourhood, the Daorizi,\r\nArdiæi, and Pleræi.[2777] Near the former lies the island Black\r\nCorcyra,[2778] on which is a city founded by the Cnidians. Near the\r\nArdiæi is Pharos, formerly called Paros, for it was founded by Parians.\r\n\r\n6. Later writers call the Ardiæi, Vardæi.[2779] The Romans drove them\r\ninto the interior from the sea-coast, which was infested by their\r\npiracies, and compelled them to cultivate the ground; but as the country\r\nwas rugged and barren, and not adapted to husbandry, the nation was\r\nentirely ruined and nearly extinguished. The same happened to other\r\nneighbouring nations. People formerly very powerful are extinct, or were\r\nreduced to the lowest condition, as the Boii and Scordisci among the\r\nGalatæ; the Autariatæ, Ardiæi, and Dardanii, among the Illyrians; and\r\nthe Triballi among the Thracians. They first declined in consequence of\r\ndisputes amongst themselves, but were finally prostrated by wars with\r\nthe Macedonians and Romans.\r\n\r\n7. After the termination of the coast of the Ardiæi and Pleræi is the\r\nbay of the Rhizæi, a city Rhizon,[2780] other small towns, and the river\r\nDrilon,[2781] which may be navigated up its stream towards the east as\r\nfar as Dardanica. This country is situated close to the Macedonian and\r\nPæonian nations, towards the south, as also the Autariatæ and the\r\nDasaretii are in parts contiguous to one another [and to the\r\nAutariatæ].[2782] To the Dardaniatæ belong the Galabrii,[2783] in whose\r\nterritory is an ancient city; and the Thunatæ, who approach on the east\r\nclose to the Mædi,[2784] a Thracian tribe.\r\n\r\nThe Dardanii are entirely a savage people, so much so that they dig\r\ncaves beneath dung heaps, in which they dwell; yet they are fond of\r\nmusic, and are much occupied in playing upon pipes and on stringed\r\ninstruments. They inhabit the inland parts of the country, and we shall\r\nmention them again in another place.\r\n\r\n8. After the bay of Rhizon[2785] is Lissus,[2786] a city,\r\nAcrolissus,[2787] and Epidamnus, the present Dyrrhachium,[2788] founded\r\nby Corcyræans, and bearing the name of the peninsula on which it [CAS.\r\n316] is situated. Then follow the rivers Apsus[2789] and the Aous,[2790]\r\non the banks of which is situated Apollonia,[2791] a city governed by\r\nexcellent laws. It was founded by Corinthians and Corcyræans, and is\r\ndistant from the river 10, and from the sea 60, stadia. Hecatæus calls\r\nthe Aous, Aïas, and says that from the same place, or rather from the\r\nsame sources about Lacmus,[2792] the Inachus flows southward, to\r\nArgos,[2793] and the Aïas westward, into the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nIn the territory of the Apolloniatæ there is what is called a Nymphæum.\r\nIt is a rock which emits fire. Below it are springs flowing with hot\r\nwater and asphaltus. The earth containing the asphaltus is probably in a\r\nstate of combustion. The asphaltus is dug out of a neighbouring hill;\r\nthe parts excavated are replaced by fresh earth, which after a time are\r\nconverted into asphaltus. This account is given by Posidonius, who says\r\nalso, that the ampelitis, an asphaltic earth found in the Pierian\r\nSeleucia,[2794] is a remedy for the lice which infest the vine. If the\r\nvine is smeared with this earth mixed with oil, the insects are killed\r\nbefore they ascend from the root to the branches. This earth, but it\r\nrequired for use a larger quantity of oil, he says was found at Rhodes\r\nalso, while he held there the office of Prytanes.\r\n\r\nNext to Apollonia is Bylliace (Bullis) and Oricum,[2795] with its naval\r\narsenal, Panormus, and the Ceraunian mountains, which form the\r\ncommencement of the entrance of the Ionian and Adriatic Gulfs.\r\n\r\n9. The mouth is common to both; but this difference is to be observed,\r\nthat the name Ionian[2796] is applied to the first part of the gulf\r\nonly, and Adriatic to the interior sea up to the farthest end, but the\r\nname Adriatic is now applied to the whole sea. According to Theopompus,\r\nthe name Ionian was derived from a chief (Ionius) of that country, a\r\nnative of Issa; and the name Adriatic from a river, Adrias.[2797]\r\n\r\nFrom the Liburni to the Ceraunian mountains is a distance of a little\r\nmore than 2000 stadia. But Theopompus says, that it is six days’ sail\r\nfrom the farthest recess of the bay, but a journey of thirty days by\r\nland along the length of Illyria. This appears to me an exaggeration,\r\nbut he makes many incredible statements. Among other instances, he\r\npretends that there is a subterraneous passage between the Adriatic and\r\nthe Ægean Seas, grounding his opinion on the discovery of Chian and\r\nThasian pottery in the river Naron.[2798] The two seas, he says, may be\r\nseen from some pretended mountain. He describes the Liburnian islands as\r\noccupying a position so extensive as to form a circle of 500 stadia.\r\nAccording to him, the Danube discharges itself by one of its mouths into\r\nthe Adriatic.[2799] Similar mistakes are to be found in Eratosthenes,\r\nwhich Polybius, when speaking of him and other writers, describes as\r\nhaving their origin in vulgar error.[2800]\r\n\r\n10. On the coast of Illyria, along its whole extent, and in the\r\nneighbouring islands, there are numerous excellent harbours, contrary to\r\nwhat occurs on the opposite Italian coast, where there are none. As in\r\nItaly, however, the climate is warm, and the soil productive of fruits;\r\nolives also and vines grow readily, except in some few excessively\r\nrugged places. Although Illyria possesses these advantages, it was\r\nformerly neglected, through ignorance, perhaps, of its fertility; but it\r\nwas principally avoided on account of the savage manners of the\r\ninhabitants, and their piratical habits.\r\n\r\nThe region situated above the sea-coast is mountainous, cold, and at\r\ntimes covered with snow. The northern part is still colder, so that\r\nvines are rarely to be met with either in the hills or in the plains\r\nlower down. These mountain-plains are in the possession of the\r\nPannonians, and extend towards the south as far as the Dalmatians and\r\nArdiæi. They terminate towards the north at the Ister, and approach\r\ntowards [CAS. 317] the east close to the Scordisci, who live near the\r\nMacedonian and Thracian mountains.\r\n\r\n11. The Autariatæ were the most populous and the bravest tribe of the\r\nIllyrians. Formerly, there were continual disputes between them and the\r\nArdiæi respecting the salt which was spontaneously formed on the\r\nconfines of their respective territories, in the spring season, from\r\nwater which flows through a valley. The salt concreted five days after\r\nthe water was drawn and deposited in reservoirs. The right of collecting\r\nsalt was, by agreement, to be exercised alternately by each party, but\r\nthe compact was broken and war was the consequence. After the Autariatæ\r\nhad subdued the Triballi, a people whose territory extended a journey of\r\nfifteen days, from the Agrianæ to the Danube, they became masters of the\r\nThracians and Illyrians. The Autariatæ were first conquered by the\r\nScordisci, and afterwards by the Romans, who overpowered the Scordisci,\r\nfor a long time a powerful nation.\r\n\r\n12. This people inhabited the country on the banks of the Danube, and\r\nwere divided into two tribes, the Great and the Little Scordisci.[2801]\r\nThe former occupied the space between two rivers, which empty themselves\r\ninto the Danube, the Noarus,[2802] which runs beside Segestica, and the\r\nMargus, or, as some call it, Bargus. The Little Scordisci lived beyond\r\nthis river close to the Triballi and Mysi.[2803] The Scordisci possessed\r\nsome of the islands also. They increased so much in strength and numbers\r\nas to advance even to the Illyrian, Pæonian, and Thracian confines. Most\r\nof the islands on the Danube fell into their hands, and they possessed\r\nthe cities Heorta and Capedunum.[2804]\r\n\r\nNext to the territory of the Scordisci, lying along the banks of the\r\nDanube, is the country of the Triballi and Mysi, whom we have before\r\nmentioned; we have also spoken of the marshes[2805] of the Lesser\r\nScythia on this side the Danube. This nation, and the Crobyzi, and the\r\nnation called Troglodytæ, live above the districts in which are situated\r\nCallatis, Tomis, and Ister.[2806] Next are the people about the Mount\r\nHæmus, and those who live at its foot, extending as far as the Pontus,\r\nCoralli, and Bessi, and some tribes of Mædi and of Dantheletæ. All these\r\nnations are very much addicted to robbery. The Bessi possess far the\r\ngreatest part of Mount Hæmus, and are called Robbers from their mode of\r\nlife as freebooters. Some of them live in huts and lead a life of\r\nhardship. They extend close to Rhodope, the Pæones, and to the Illyrian\r\nnations; to the Autariatæ also, and the Dardanians. Between these and\r\nthe Ardiæi are the Dasaretii, Hybrianes, and other obscure nations,\r\nwhose numbers the Scordisci were continually reducing, until they had\r\nmade the country a desert, full of impassable forests, which extended\r\nseveral days’ journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of the country situated between the Danube and the mountains on each\r\nside of Pæonia, there remains to be described the Pontic coast, which\r\nreaches from the Sacred mouth of the Danube to the mountainous district\r\nabout Hæmus, and to the mouth of the Pontus at Byzantium. As in\r\ndescribing the Illyrian coast we had proceeded as far as the Ceraunian\r\nmountains, which, although they stretch beyond the mountainous district\r\nof Illyria, yet constitute a sort of proper boundary, we determined by\r\nmeans of these mountains the limits of the nations in the inland parts,\r\nconsidering, that such separating lines would be better marks both for\r\nour present and future use; so here also the coast, although it may fall\r\nbeyond the mountainous line, will still end at a proper kind of limit,\r\nthe mouth of the Pontus, which will be useful both for our present and\r\nour future descriptions.\r\n\r\nIf we set out from the Sacred mouth of the Danube, having on the right\r\nhand the continuous line of coast, we find at the [CAS. 319] distance of\r\n500 stadia, Ister,[2807] a small town founded by Milesians; then\r\nTomis,[2808] another small town, at the distance of 250 stadia; then\r\nCallatis,[2809] a city, a colony of the Heracleotæ, at 280 stadia; then,\r\nat 1300 stadia, Apollonia,[2810] a colony of Milesians, having the\r\ngreater part of the buildings upon a small island, where is a temple of\r\nApollo, whence Marcus Lucullus took the Colossus of Apollo, the work of\r\nCalamides, and dedicated it as a sacred offering in the Capitol. In the\r\nintermediate distance between Callatis and Apollonia, is Bizone, a great\r\npart of which was swallowed up by an earthquake; Cruni;[2811]\r\nOdessus,[2812] a colony of Milesians; and Naulochus, a small town of the\r\nMesembriani. Next follows the mountain Hæmus,[2813] extending to the sea\r\nin this quarter; then Mesembria,[2814] a colony of the Megarenses,\r\nformerly called Menabria, or city of Mena, Menas being the name of the\r\nfounder, and bria,[2815] signifying in the Thracian tongue, city. Thus\r\nthe city of Selys is called Selybria, and Ænus once had the name of\r\nPoltyobria. Then follows Anchiale,[2816] a small town of the\r\nApolloniatæ, and Apollonia itself.\r\n\r\nOn this coast is the promontory Tirizis, a place naturally strong, which\r\nLysimachus formerly used as a treasury. Again, from Apollonia to the\r\nCyaneæ are about 1500 stadia. In this interval are Thynias, a tract\r\nbelonging to the Apolloniatæ, Phinopolis, and Andriace,[2817] which are\r\ncontiguous to Salmydessus. This coast is without inhabitants and rocky,\r\nwithout harbours, stretching far towards the north, and extending as far\r\nas the Cyaneæ, about 700 stadia. Those who are wrecked on this coast are\r\nplundered by the Asti, a Thracian tribe who live above it.\r\n\r\nThe Cyaneæ[2818] are two small islands at the mouth of the Pontus, one\r\nlying near Europe, the other near Asia, and are separated by a channel\r\nof about 20 stadia. This is the measure of the distance between the\r\ntemple of the Byzantines and the temple of the Chalcedonians, where is\r\nthe narrowest part of the mouth of the Euxine Sea. For proceeding\r\nonwards 10 stadia there is a promontory, which reduces the strait to 5\r\nstadia; the strait afterwards opens to a greater width, and begins to\r\nform the Propontis.\r\n\r\n2. From the promontory, then, that reduces the strait to 5 stadia, to\r\nthe Port under the Fig-tree, as it is called, are 35 stadia; thence to\r\nthe Horn of the Byzantines, 5 stadia. This Horn, close to the walls of\r\nByzantium, is a bay, extending westwards 60 stadia, and resembling a\r\nstag’s horn, for it is divided into a great many bays, like so many\r\nbranches. The Pelamides[2819] resort to these bays, and are easily\r\ntaken, on account of their great number, and the force of the current,\r\nwhich drives them together in a body; and also on account of the\r\nnarrowness of the bays, which is such that they are caught even by the\r\nhand. These fish are bred in the marshes of the Mæotis. When they have\r\nattained a little size and strength, they rush through the mouth in\r\nshoals, and are carried along the Asiatic coast as far as Trapezus and\r\nPharnacia. It is here that the fishery begins, but it is not carried on\r\nto any considerable extent, because the fish are not of a proper size at\r\nthis place. When they get as far as Sinope, they are in better season\r\nfor the fishery, and for the purpose of salting. But when they have\r\nreached and passed the Cyaneæ, a white rock projects from the\r\nChalcedonian shore, which alarms the fish, so that they immediately turn\r\naway to the opposite coast. There they are caught by the stream, and the\r\nnature of the places being such as to divert the current of the sea in\r\nthat part towards Byzantium, and the Horn near it, the fish are impelled\r\nthither in a body, and afford to the Byzantines, and to the Roman\r\npeople, a large revenue. The Chalcedonians, however, although situated\r\nnear, and on the opposite side, have no share of this supply, because\r\nthe Pelamides do not approach their harbours.\r\n\r\nAfter the foundation of Chalcedon, Apollo is said to have [CAS. 320]\r\nenjoined the founders of Byzantium, in answer to their inquiries, to\r\nbuild their city opposite to the Blind, applying this name to the\r\nChalcedonians, who, although they were the first persons to arrive in\r\nthese parts, had omitted to take possession of the opposite side, which\r\nafforded such great resources of wealth, and chose the barren coast.\r\n\r\nWe have continued our description to Byzantium, because this celebrated\r\ncity,[2820] by its proximity to the mouth of the Euxine Sea, forms a\r\nbetter-known and more remarkable termination of an account of the coast\r\nfrom the Danube than any other.\r\n\r\nAbove Byzantium is the nation of the Asti, in whose territory is the\r\ncity Calybe, which Philip the son of Amyntas made a settlement for\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. These are the nations, bounded by the Danube and by the Illyrian and\r\nThracian mountains, which are worthy of record. They occupy the whole\r\ncoast of the Adriatic Sea, beginning from the recess of the gulf, and\r\nthe left side, as it is called, of the Euxine Sea, from the river Danube\r\nto Byzantium.\r\n\r\nThe southern parts of the above-mentioned mountainous tract, and the\r\ncountries which follow, lying below it, remain to be described. Among\r\nthese are Greece, and the contiguous barbarous country extending to the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nHecatæus of Miletus says of the Peloponnesus, that, before the time of\r\nthe Greeks, it was inhabited by barbarians. Perhaps even the whole of\r\nGreece was, anciently, a settlement of barbarians, if we judge from\r\nformer accounts. For Pelops brought colonists from Phrygia into the\r\nPeloponnesus, which took his name; Danaus[2821] brought colonists from\r\nEgypt; Dryopes, Caucones, Pelasgi, Leleges, and other barbarous nations,\r\npartitioned among themselves the country on this side of the\r\nisthmus.[2822] The case was the same on the other side of the isthmus;\r\nfor Thracians, under their leader Eumolpus,[2823] took possession of\r\nAttica; Tereus of Daulis in Phocæa; the Phœnicians, with their leader\r\nCadmus,[2824] occupied the Cadmeian district; Aones, and Temmices, and\r\nHyantes, Bœotia. Pindar says, “there was a time when the Bœotian people\r\nwere called Syes.”[2825] Some names show their barbarous origin, as\r\nCecrops, Codrus, Œclus, Cothus, Drymas, and Crinacus.[2826] Thracians,\r\nIllyrians, and Epirotæ are settled even at present on the sides of\r\nGreece. Formerly the territory they possessed was more extensive,\r\nalthough even now the barbarians possess a large part of the country,\r\nwhich, without dispute, is Greece. Macedonia is occupied by Thracians,\r\nas well as some parts of Thessaly; the country above Acarnania and\r\nÆtolia, by Thesproti, Cassopæi, Amphilochi, Molotti, and Athamanes,\r\nEpirotic tribes.\r\n\r\n2. We have already spoken of the Pelasgi.[2827] Some writers conjecture\r\nthat the Leleges and Carians are the same people; others, that they were\r\nonly joint settlers, and comrades in war, because there are said to be\r\nsome settlements called Settlements of the Leleges in the Milesian\r\nterritory, and in many parts of Caria there are burial-places of the\r\nLeleges, and deserted fortresses, called Lelegia.\r\n\r\nThe whole country called Ionia was formerly inhabited by Carians and\r\nLeleges; these were expelled by the Ionians, who themselves took\r\npossession of the country. In still [CAS. 322] earlier times, the\r\ncaptors of Troy[2828] had driven out the Leleges from the places about\r\nIda near the rivers Pedasus and Satnioeis.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the association of these people with the Carians may be\r\nregarded as a proof of their being barbarians, and Aristotle, in his\r\nPolitics, shows that they were a wandering nation, sometimes in company\r\nwith the Carians, sometimes alone, and that from ancient times; for, in\r\nspeaking of the polity of the Acarnanians, he says that the Curetes\r\noccupied a part of the country, and the Leleges (and after them the\r\nTeleboæ) the western side. On the subject of the Ætolian polity, he\r\ncalls the present Locri, Leleges, and observes that they occupy Bœotia.\r\nHe repeats the same remark on the subject of the polity of the Opuntians\r\nand Megareans. In speaking of the polity of the Leucadians, he mentions\r\nan aboriginal by name, Leleges, and a grandson by his daughter of the\r\nname of Teleboas, and besides two and twenty of his sons of the name of\r\nTeleboas, some of whom inhabited Lucas. But we should chiefly rely upon\r\nHesiod, who thus speaks of them:\r\n\r\n   “For Locrus was the leader of the nation of the Leleges, whom\r\n   Jupiter, the son of Saturn, in his infinite wisdom, once gave as\r\n   subjects to Deucalion, a people gathered from among the nations\r\n   of the earth.”\r\n\r\nFor it seems to me to be obscurely intimated by the etymology of the\r\nname, Leleges, that they were a mixed people anciently collected\r\ntogether, which had become extinct. And this may be said of the\r\nCaucones, who exist no where at present, yet were formerly settled in\r\nseveral places.\r\n\r\n3. Although Greece was formerly composed of small nations, many in\r\nnumber, and obscure; nevertheless their valour, and their separate\r\ngovernment by kings, prevented any difficulty in defining their\r\nboundaries. As the greatest part of the country, however, is at present\r\nuninhabited, and the settlements, especially the cities, have been\r\ndestroyed, it would be of no service, even if it were possible, to\r\nascertain the names of cities and regions occupied by obscure and\r\nextinct people. This destruction, which began a long time since, still\r\ncontinues in many parts in consequence of rebellion. It has been checked\r\nby the Romans, who accepted the supreme authority from the inhabitants\r\nand lodged soldiers in their houses.\r\n\r\nPolybius says that Paulus [Emilius], after the defeat of the\r\nMacedonians[2829] and their king Perseus, destroyed 70 cities of the\r\nEpirotæ (most of which belonged to the Molotti) and reduced to slavery\r\n150,000 of the inhabitants. Still, however, I shall endeavour, as far as\r\nit is compatible with the design of this work, to describe, as far as I\r\nam able, these places in detail, beginning from the sea-coast near the\r\nIonian Gulf, where the navigation out of the Adriatic terminates.\r\n\r\n4. The first parts of this coast are those about Epidamnus and\r\nApollonia. From Apollonia to Macedonia is the Egnatian Way; its\r\ndirection is towards the east, and the distance is measured by pillars\r\nat every mile, as far as Cypselus[2830] and the river Hebrus.[2831] The\r\nwhole distance is 535 miles. But reckoning, as the generality of persons\r\nreckon, a mile at eight stadia, there may be 4280 stadia. And according\r\nto Polybius, who adds two plethra, that is, the third of a stadium, to\r\nevery eight stadia, we must add 178 stadia more, a third part of the\r\nnumber of miles.[2832] A traveller from Apollonia,[2833] and a traveller\r\nfrom Epidamnus,[2834] on the same road, meet midway between the two\r\ncities. The whole is called the Egnatian Way. The first part of it is\r\ncalled the road to Candavia, which is an Illyrian mountain. It passes\r\nthrough Lychnidus,[2835] a city, and Pylon, a place which separates\r\nIllyria from Macedonia. Thence its direction is beside Barnus through\r\nHeracleia, the Lyncestæ, and the Eordi, to Edessa[2836] and Pella,[2837]\r\nas far as Thessalonica.[2838] Polybius says, that this is a distance of\r\n267 miles. In travelling this road from the neighbourhood of Epidamnus\r\nand Apollonia, on the right hand are the Epirotic nations situated on\r\nthe coast of the Sicilian Sea, and extending as far as the Gulf of\r\nAmbracia;[2839] on the left are the Illyrian mountains, which we have\r\nbefore described, and the nations that live near them, extending as far\r\nas Macedonia and the Pæones.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 323] From the Gulf of Ambracia the places next in order, inclining\r\nto the east, and extending opposite to Peloponnesus, belong to Greece;\r\nthey terminate at the Ægean Sea, leaving the whole of Peloponnesus on\r\nthe right hand.\r\n\r\nThe country, from the commencement of the Macedonian and Pæonian\r\nmountains, as far as the river Strymon,[2840] is inhabited by\r\nMacedonians, and Pæones, and some of the Thracian mountain tribes. But\r\nall the country on the other side the Strymon, as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Euxine Sea, and Mount Hæmus,[2841] belong to the Thracians, except\r\nthe coast, which is occupied by Greeks, some of whom are settled on the\r\nPropontis,[2842] others on the Hellespont and on the Gulf Melas,[2843]\r\nand others on the Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Ægean Sea waters two sides of Greece; first, the eastern side,\r\nextending from the promontory Sunium[2844] to the north as far as the\r\nThermæan Gulf, and Thessalonica, a Macedonian city, which has, at\r\npresent, the largest population in these parts. Then the southern side,\r\nwhich is a part of Macedonia, extending from Thessalonica to the\r\nStrymon. Some writers assign the coast from the Strymon as far as\r\nNestus[2845] to Macedonia. For Philip showed the greatest solicitude to\r\nobtain, and at length appropriated it to himself. He raised a very large\r\nrevenue from the mines, and from other sources which the richness of the\r\ncountry afforded.\r\n\r\nFrom Sunium to the Peloponnesus are the Myrtoan, the Cretan, and the\r\nLibyan Seas, together with the Gulfs, as far as the Sicilian Sea, which\r\nconsist of the Gulfs of Ambracia, of Corinth, and of Crissa.\r\n\r\n5. Theopompus says, that there are fourteen Epirotic nations. Of these,\r\nthe most celebrated are the Chaones and Molotti, because the whole of\r\nEpirus was at one time subject, first to Chaones, afterwards to Molotti.\r\nTheir power was greatly strengthened by the family of their kings being\r\ndescended from the Æacidæ, and because the ancient and famous oracle of\r\nDodona[2846] was in their country. Chaones, Thesproti, and next after\r\nthese Cassopæi, (who are Thesproti,) occupy the coast, a fertile tract\r\nreaching from the Ceraunian mountains to the Ambracian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe voyage commencing from the Chaones eastward towards the Gulfs of\r\nAmbracia and Corinth, and having the Ausonian Sea on the right, and\r\nEpirus on the left, comprises 1300 stadia to the mouth of the Ambracian\r\nGulf. In this interval is Panormus,[2847] a large port in the middle of\r\nthe Ceraunian mountains. Next to this is Onchesmus,[2848] another\r\nharbour, opposite to which are the western extremities of Corcyra,[2849]\r\nand then again another port, Cassiope,[2850] (Cassope?) whence to\r\nBrundusium[2851] are 1700 stadia. It is the same distance to Tarentum\r\nfrom another promontory more to the south than Cassiope, which is called\r\nPhalacrum. Next after Onchesmus are Posidium, and Buthrotum,[2852]\r\n(which is situated upon the mouth of the lake Pelodes, in a spot of a\r\npeninsula form, and has a Roman colony,) and the Sybota. The\r\nSybota[2853] are small islands at a little distance from Epirus, lying\r\nnear Leucimme,[2854] the eastern promontory of Corcyra. There are also\r\nother small islands, not worthy of notice, which are met with along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nNext is the promontory Chimerium, and a harbour called Glycys-Limen, [or\r\nSweet Harbour,] where the river Acheron, which receives several other\r\nrivers, empties itself and renders fresh the water of the gulf. The\r\nThyamus[2855] flows near it. Above this gulf is situated Cichyrus,\r\nformerly Ephyra, a city of the Thesproti, and above the gulf at\r\nButhrotum, Phœnice.[2856] Near Cichyrus is Buchetium, a small city of\r\nthe Cassopæi, situated at a little distance from the sea; Elatria,\r\nPandosia, and Batiæ are in the inland parts. Their territory extends as\r\nfar as the gulf. Next after the harbour Glycys-Limen are two others,\r\nComarus,[2857] the nearest and smallest, forming an isthmus of 60\r\nstadia, near the Ambracian Gulf and Nicopolis,[2858] founded by Augustus\r\nCæsar; the other, the more distant and larger, and better harbour, is\r\nnear the mouth of the gulf, and distant from Nicopolis about 12 stadia.\r\n\r\n6. Then follows the entrance of the Ambracian Gulf, [CAS. 326] which is\r\na little more than four stadia in width. The circuit of the gulf is 400\r\nstadia, and the whole has good harbours. On sailing into it, on the\r\nright hand are the Acarnanes, who are Greeks; and here near the entrance\r\nof the gulf is a temple of Apollo Actius, situated on an eminence; in\r\nthe plain below is a sacred grove, and a naval station. Here Augustus\r\nCæsar[2859] dedicated as offerings one-tenth of the vessels taken in\r\nwar, from vessels of one bank to vessels of ten banks of oars. The\r\nvessels, and the buildings destined for their reception, were destroyed,\r\nit is said, by fire.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand are Nicopolis,[2860] and the Cassopæi, a tribe of the\r\nEpirotæ, extending as far as the recess of the gulf at Ambracia.\r\nAmbracia[2861] is situated a little above the recess of the bay, and was\r\nfounded by Gorgus, (Torgus, Tolgus,) the son of Cypselus. The river\r\nArathus flows beside it, which may be navigated up the stream to the\r\ncity, a distance of a few stadia. It rises in Mount Tymphe, and the\r\nParoræa. This city was formerly in a very flourishing condition, and\r\nhence the gulf received its name from the city. Pyrrhus, however,\r\nembellished it more than any other person, and made it a royal\r\nresidence. In later times,[2862] the Macedonians and Romans harassed\r\nthis and other cities by continual wars, caused by the refractory\r\ndisposition of the inhabitants, so that Augustus, at length perceiving\r\nthat these cities were entirely deserted, collected their remaining\r\ninhabitants into one city, which he called Nicopolis, situated upon the\r\ngulf. He called it after the victory which he obtained in front of the\r\ngulf, over Antony, and Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, who was present in\r\nthe engagement.\r\n\r\nNicopolis is well peopled, and is improving every day. It has a large\r\nterritory, and is adorned with the spoils of war. In the suburbs is a\r\nsacred enclosure; part of it is a grove, containing a gymnasium and a\r\nstadium, intended for the celebration of quinquennial games; the other\r\npart, on a rising ground overhanging the grove, is sacred to Apollo. The\r\nOlympian game, called the Actia,[2863] is instituted there in honour of\r\nApollo Actius. It is under the superintendence of the Lacedæmonians. The\r\nother surrounding settlements are dependent on Nicopolis. The Actian\r\ngames[2863] were formerly celebrated in honour of the god by the\r\nneighbouring people; it was a contest in which the victor was crowned;\r\nbut Cæsar has conferred on it greater honours.\r\n\r\n7. After Ambracia follows the Amphilochian Argos, founded by Alcmæon and\r\nhis sons. According to Ephorus, Alcmæon, after the expedition of the\r\nEpigoni[2864] against Thebes, upon the solicitation of Diomed,\r\naccompanied him in his invasion of Ætolia, and obtained joint possession\r\nof this country and of Acarnania. When Agamemnon invited them to come to\r\nthe siege of Troy, Diomed went, but Alcmæon remained in Acarnania,\r\nfounded Argos, and gave it the name Amphilochian, after his brother\r\nAmphilochus. On the same authority the river Inachus, which flows\r\nthrough the country and empties itself into the bay, received its name\r\nfrom the river in the Argive territory. Thucydides, however, says that\r\nAmphilochus himself, upon his return from Troy, dissatisfied with the\r\nstate of things at Argos, passed over into Acarnania, and having\r\nsucceeded to the dynasty of his brother, founded the city which is\r\ncalled after his name.\r\n\r\n8. The Amphilochians are Epirotæ, as also are those nations who inhabit\r\na rugged country situated above and close to the Illyrian mountains, the\r\nMolotti, Athamanes, Æthices, Tymphæi, Orestæ Paroræi, and Atintanes,\r\nsome of whom approach nearer to Macedonia, others to the Ionian Gulf. It\r\nis said that Orestes possessed the territory Orestias at the time of his\r\nflight, after the murder of his mother, and left the country [CAS. 327]\r\nbearing his name, where also he had built a city called Orestic Argos.\r\nWith these people are intermixed Illyrian nations, some of whom are\r\nsituated on the southern part of the mountainous district, and others\r\nabove the Ionian Gulf. For above Epidamnus and Apollonia, as far as the\r\nCeraunian mountains, live the Bulliones, Taulantii, Parthini, and\r\nBrygi.[2865]\r\n\r\nSomewhere near are the silver mines of Damastium. Here the Perisadyes\r\nhad established their sway, and Enchelii, who are also called\r\nSesarethii. Then come the Lyncestæ, the territory Deuriopus,\r\nPelagonia-Tripolitis, the Eordi, Elimia, and Eratyra. Formerly each of\r\nthese nations was under its own prince. The chiefs of the Enchelii were\r\ndescendants of Cadmus and Harmonia, and scenes of the fables respecting\r\nthese persons are shown in the territory. This nation, therefore, was\r\nnot governed by native princes. The Lyncestæ were under Arrhabæus, who\r\nwas of the race of the Bacchiadæ. Irra was his daughter, and his\r\ngrand-daughter was Eurydice, the mother of Philip Amyntas.\r\n\r\nThe Molotti also were Epirotæ, and were subjects of Pyrrhus Neoptolemus,\r\nthe son of Achilles, and of his descendants, who were Thessalians. The\r\nrest were governed by native princes. Some tribes were continually\r\nendeavouring to obtain the mastery over the others, but all were finally\r\nsubdued by the Macedonians, except a few situated above the Ionian Gulf.\r\nThey gave the name of Upper Macedonia to the country about Lyncestis,\r\nPelagonia, Orestias, and Elimia. Later writers called it Macedonia the\r\nFree, and some extend the name of Macedonia to all the country as far as\r\nCorcyra, at the same time assigning as their reasons, the mode of\r\ncutting their hair, their language, the use of the chlamys, and similar\r\nthings in which they resemble the Macedonians; some of them, however,\r\nspeak two languages. On the dissolution of the Macedonian empire, they\r\nfell under the power of the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe Egnatian Way, from Epidamnus and Apollonia, passes through the\r\nterritory of these people. Near the road to Candavia are the lakes about\r\nLychnidus, which furnish large supplies of fish for salting, and rivers,\r\nsome of which empty themselves into the Ionian Gulf. Some flow towards\r\nthe south, as the Inachus, the Arathus, (Ratoüs,) the Achelous, and the\r\nEvenus, formerly called Lycormas. The Ratoüs discharges its waters into\r\nthe Ambracian Gulf, the Inachus into the Achelous, the Achelous itself\r\ninto the sea, as also the Evenus; the former traverses Acarnania, the\r\nlatter Ætolia. The Erigon, after having received many streams which flow\r\nfrom the Illyrian mountains, and through the territories of Lyncestæ,\r\nBrygi, Deuriopes, and Pelagonians, empties itself into the Axius.\r\n\r\n9. There were formerly cities among these nations. The district\r\nPelagonia-Tripolitis contained (as the name signifies) three cities, of\r\nwhich Azorus was one. All the cities of the Deuriopes were situated on\r\nthe banks of the Erigon; among which were Bryanium, Alalcomenæ,[2866]\r\nand Stymbara.[2867] Cydriæ belonged to the Brygi, and Æginium on the\r\nconfines of Æthicia, and Tricca, to the Tymphæi. Near Macedonia and\r\nThessalia, about the mountains Pœus and Pindus, are the Æthices, and the\r\nsources of the Peneus, which are a subject of dispute between the\r\nTymphæi and the Thessalians, who are situated below Pindus.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the river Ion is Oxynia, a city distant from Azorus in\r\nthe Tripolitis 120 stadia. Near Oxynia are Alalcomenæ, Æginium, Europus,\r\nand the confluence of the Ion with the Peneus.\r\n\r\nAt that time then, as I said before, the whole of Epirus and Illyria\r\nwere well peopled, although the country is rugged and full of mountains,\r\nsuch as Tomarus, and Polyanus, and many others. At present the greater\r\npart is uninhabited, and the inhabited parts are left in the state of\r\nvillages, or in ruins. Even the oracle at Dodona has almost been\r\ndeserted, like the rest.\r\n\r\n10. This oracle, according to Ephorus, was established by Pelasgi, who\r\nare said to be the most ancient people that were sovereigns in Greece.\r\nThus the poet speaks,\r\n\r\n   “O great Pelasgic Dodonæan Jove;”[2868]\r\n\r\nand Hesiod,\r\n\r\n   “He went to Dodona, the dwelling of the Pelasgi, and to the beech\r\n    tree.”\r\n\r\n[CAS. 328] I have spoken of the Pelasgi in the account of Tyrrhenia.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Dodona, Homer clearly intimates that the people who\r\nlived about the temple were barbarians, from their mode of life,\r\ndescribing them as persons who do not wash their feet, and who sleep on\r\nthe ground. Whether we should read Helli, with Pindar, or Selli, as it\r\nis conjectured the word existed in Homer, the ambiguity of the writing\r\ndoes not permit us to affirm confidently. Philochorus says, that the\r\ncountry about Dodona was called, like Eubœa, Hellopia; for these are the\r\nwords of Hesiod,\r\n\r\n   “There is a country Hellopia, rich in corn-fields and pastures;\r\n   at its extremity is built Dodona.”\r\n\r\nIt is supposed, says Apollodorus, that it had this name from the “hele,”\r\nor marshes about the temple. He is of opinion that the poet did not call\r\nthe people about the temple Helli, but Selli, adding, that Homer\r\nmentions a certain river (near) of the name of Selleis. He specifies the\r\nname in this line,\r\n\r\n   “At a distance far from Ephyra, from the river Selleis.”\r\n\r\n[Demetrius of Skepsis contends that] Ephyra of Thesprotia is not here\r\nmeant, but Ephyra of Elis. For the river Selleis is in Elis, and there\r\nis no river of this name either in Thesprotia or among the Molotti. The\r\nfable of the oak and the doves, and other similar things, like the\r\nstories connected with Delphi, although they are subjects more adapted\r\nto engage the attention of a poet, yet are appropriate to the\r\ndescription of the country with which we are now occupied.\r\n\r\nDodona was formerly subject to the Thesproti, as was the mountain\r\nTomarus, or Tmarus, (both names are in use,) below which the temple is\r\nsituated. The tragic writers and Pindar give the epithet of Thesprotis\r\nto Dodona. It was said to be subject, in later times, to the Molotti.\r\nThose called by the poet Jove’s interpreters,[2869] and described by him\r\nas men with unwashen feet, who slept on the ground, were, it is said,\r\ncalled Tomuri[2870] from Mount Tomarus, and the passage in the Odyssey\r\ncontaining the advice of Amphinomus to the suitors not to attack\r\nTelemachus before they had inquired of Jupiter is as follows,\r\n\r\n   “If the Tomuri of great Jove approve, I myself will kill him, and\r\n   I will order all to join in the deed; but if the god forbid it, I\r\n   command to withhold.”[2871]\r\n\r\nFor it is better, it is asserted, to write Tomuri[2872] than\r\nThemistæ,[2873] because in no passage whatever are oracles called by the\r\npoet Themistæ, this term being applied to decrees,[2874] or statutes and\r\nrules of civil government; and the persons are called Tomuri,[2875]\r\nwhich is the contracted form of Tomaruri,[2876] or guardians of Tomarus.\r\n\r\nIn Homer, however, we must understand θέμιστες in a more simple sense,\r\nand, like βουλαί, by the figure Catachresis, as meaning commands and\r\noracular injunctions as well as laws; for such is the import of this\r\nline:\r\n\r\n   “To listen to[2877] the will of Jove, which comes forth from the\r\n   lofty and verdant oak.”\r\n\r\n12. The first prophets were men, and this the poet perhaps indicates,\r\nfor he calls the persons interpreters,[2878] among whom the\r\nprophets[2879] might be classed. In after-times three old women were\r\nappointed to this office, after even Dione had a common temple with\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nSuidas, in order to court the favour of the Thessalians by fabulous\r\nstories, says, that the temple was transported from Scotussa of the\r\nThessalian Pelasgiotis, accompanied by a great multitude, chiefly of\r\nwomen, whose descendants are the present prophetesses, and that hence\r\nJupiter had the epithet Pelasgic. Cineas relates what is still more\r\nfabulous * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   [With the exception of the following Fragments, the rest of this\r\n   book is lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS.[2880]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The oracle was formerly at Scotussa, a city of Pelasgiotis, but was\r\ntransferred to Dodona by the command of Apollo, after some persons had\r\nburnt down the tree. The oracular answers were not conveyed by words,\r\nbut by certain signs, as at the oracle of Ammon in Libya. Probably the\r\nthree doves made some peculiar flight, which, observed by the\r\npriestesses, suggested the oracular answer. Some say that, in the\r\nlanguage of the Molotti and Thesprotæ, old women are called “peliæ,” and\r\nold men “pelii,” so that the celebrated doves were probably not birds,\r\nbut three old women who passed an idle time about the temple. EPIT.\r\n\r\n2. Among the Thesprotæ and Molotti old women are called “peliæ,” and old\r\nmen “pelii,” as among the Macedonians. Persons at least who hold office\r\nare called “peligones,” as among the Laconians and Massilienses they are\r\ncalled “gerontes.” Hence it is asserted that the story of the doves in\r\nthe oak at Dodona is a fable. E.\r\n\r\n3. The proverb, “The brazen vessel of Dodona,” thus arose. In the temple\r\nwas a brazen vessel, having over it a statue of a man (an offering of\r\nthe Corcyræans) grasping in the hand a brazen scourge of three thongs,\r\nwoven in chains, from which were suspended small bones. The bones\r\nstriking continually upon the brazen vessel, whenever they were agitated\r\nby the wind, produced a long protracted sound, so that a person from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the vibrations might proceed to count as far as\r\nfour hundred. Whence also came the proverb, “The Corcyræan\r\nscourge.”[2881] EPIT.\r\n\r\n4. Pæonia is to the east of these nations, and to the west of the\r\nThracian mountains; on the north it lies above Macedonia. Through the\r\ncity Gortynium and Stobi it admits of a passage to * * * (through which\r\nthe Axius flows, and renders the access difficult from Pæonia into\r\nMacedonia, as the Peneus flowing through Tempe protects it on the side\r\nof Greece.) On the south, Pæonia borders on the Autariatæ, the Dardanii,\r\nand the Ardiæi; it extends also as far as the Strymon. E.\r\n\r\n5. The Haliacmon[2882] flows into the Thermæan Gulf. E.\r\n\r\n6. Orestis is of considerable extent; there is in it a large mountain\r\nwhich reaches to Corax[2883] of Ætolia and to Parnassus. It is inhabited\r\nby the Orestæ themselves, by the Tymphæans, and by Greeks without the\r\nisthmus, namely, those who also occupy Parnassus, Œta, and Pindus. As a\r\nwhole, the mountain is called by one name, Boion, (Pœum ?) but the\r\nseparate divisions bear various names. The Ægean, Ambracian, and Ionian\r\nSeas are said to be distinguishable from the highest elevations, but\r\nthis appears to me to be an extravagant assertion; for Pteleum rises to\r\na considerable height, and is situated near the Ambracian Gulf,\r\nstretching on one side to the Corcyræan and on the other to the\r\nLeucadian Seas. E.\r\n\r\n7. Corcyra, humbled by many wars, became a subject of ridicule, and\r\npassed into a proverb. E.\r\n\r\n8. Corcyra was formerly a flourishing place, and possessed a\r\nconsiderable naval force, but went into decay through war and the\r\noppression of its rulers. In later times, although restored to liberty\r\nby the Romans, it acquired no renown, but the taunting proverb was\r\napplied to it, “Corcyra the Free, ease yourself where you please.” EPIT.\r\n\r\n9. Of Europe, there remains Macedonia, and the parts of Thrace\r\ncontiguous to it, extending to Byzantium, Greece also, and the adjacent\r\nislands: indeed, Macedonia is a part of Greece. Following, however, the\r\nnatural character of the country and its form, we have determined to\r\nseparate it from Greece, and to unite it with Thrace, which borders upon\r\nit.——Strabo, after a few remarks, mentions Cypsela[2884] and the river\r\nHebrus.[2885] He also describes a parallelogram in which is placed the\r\nwhole of Macedonia. E.\r\n\r\n10. Macedonia is bounded on the west by the sea-coast of the Adriatic;\r\non the east by a meridian line parallel to this coast, passing through\r\nthe mouth of the river Hebrus, and the city Cypsela; on the north by an\r\nimaginary straight line passing through the mountains Bertiscus,\r\nScardus,[2886] Orbelus,[2887] Rhodope,[2888] and Hæmus.[2889] For these\r\nmountains extend in a straight line, beginning from the Adriatic, to the\r\nEuxine, forming towards the south a great peninsula, which comprehends\r\nThrace, Macedonia, Epirus, and Achaia. On the south, Macedonia is\r\nbounded by the Egnatian Way, which goes from Dyrrachium eastwards to\r\nThessalonica, and thus has very nearly the form of a parallelogram.\r\nEPIT.\r\n\r\n11. The country now called Macedonia was formerly called Emathia. It\r\nacquired this name from Macedon, one of its ancient princes. There was\r\nalso a city Emathia near the sea. The country was occupied by some of\r\nthe Epirotæ and Illyrians, but the greatest part by Bottiæi and\r\nThracians. The Bottiæi were of Cretan origin, and came under the command\r\nof Botton; the Pieres, who were Thracians, inhabited Pieria and the\r\nparts about Olympus; the Pæonians, the borders of the river Axius, from\r\nwhence the region was called Amphaxitis; the Edoni and Bisalti, the rest\r\nof the country as far as the Strymon. The Bisalti retained their name,\r\nbut the Edoni went under the various names of Mygdones, Edoni, (Odones?)\r\nand Sithones. Of all these people, the Argeadæ and the Chalcidenses of\r\nEubœa became the chief. The Chalcidenses came from Eubœa into the\r\nterritory of the Sithones, and there founded about thirty cities. They\r\nwere subsequently driven out by the Sithones, but the greater part of\r\nthem collected together into a single city, namely, Olynthus.[2890] They\r\nhad the name of Chalcidenses-in-Thrace. E.\r\n\r\n12. The Peneus separates Lower Macedonia and the sea-board from Thessaly\r\nand Magnesia. The Haliacmon is the boundary of Upper Macedonia; and the\r\nHaliacmon, the Erigon, the Axius, and other rivers, form the boundary\r\nbetween Macedonia and the Epirotæ and the Pæonians. E.\r\n\r\n13. If a line is drawn from the recess of the Thermaic Gulf, on the\r\nsea-coast of Macedonia, and from Thessalonica, southwards, to Sunium,\r\nand another eastwards, towards the Thracian Chersonese, an angle will be\r\nmade in the recess. Macedonia extends in both directions, and we must\r\nbegin with the line first mentioned. The first part of it has beyond it\r\nAttica with Megaris to the Crissæan Bay. Next succeeds the sea-coast of\r\nBœotia near Eubœa. Above Eubœa on the west lies the rest of Bœotia,\r\nparallel with Attica. Strabo says that the Egnatian Way begins from the\r\nIonian Gulf and ends at Thessalonica. E.\r\n\r\n14. From these reefs, says Strabo, we shall first mark the boundaries of\r\nthose who live about the river Peneus and Haliacmon near the sea. The\r\nPeneus flows from Mount Pindus through the middle of Thrace eastwards;\r\npassing through the cities of the Lapithæ and some of the cities of the\r\nPerrhæbi, it arrives at the vale of Tempe, having in its course received\r\nthe waters of several rivers: of these, the Europus (Eurotas) is one,\r\ncalled by the poet Titaresius. It rises from Titarius, (Titarus,) a\r\nmountain continuous with Olympus, which at this point first begins to\r\nmark the boundary between Macedonia and Thessaly. Tempe is a narrow\r\nvalley between Olympus and Ossa. The Peneus continues its course from\r\nthis narrow pass 40 stadia, having Olympus, the highest of the\r\nMacedonian mountains, on the left, [and Ossa on the right, near] the\r\nmouth of the river. At the mouth of the Peneus on the right is situated\r\nGyrton, a city of the Perrhæbi, and Magnetis, where Pirithous and Ixion\r\nwere kings. The city Crannon is 100 stadia distant from Gyrton. Some\r\nassert, that in the lines of Homer, “These two from Thrace,” and what\r\nfollows, for Ephyri we are to understand Crannonii, and for Phlegyes,\r\nthe people of Gyrton. Pieria is on the other side. E.\r\n\r\n15. The Peneus, rising in Mount Pindus, flows through Tempe, the middle\r\nof Thessaly, the Lapithæ, and the Perrhæbi. It receives the Europus,\r\n(Eurotas,) which Homer calls Titaresius, in its course, and forms on the\r\nnorth the boundary of Macedonia, and on the south that of Thessaly. The\r\nsources of the river Europus are in Mount Titarius, which is contiguous\r\nto Olympus. Olympus itself is in Macedonia; Ossa and Pelion in Thessaly.\r\nEPIT.\r\n\r\n16. At the roots of Olympus, and on the banks of the Peneus, is Gyrton,\r\na Perrhæbic city, and Magnetis, where Pirithous and Ixion ruled. [The\r\ncity] Crannon is [100 stadia] distant [from Gyrton]; and it is said that\r\nwhen the poet writes “Both from Thrace,” we are to understand by Ephyri,\r\nthe Crannonians, and by Phlegyes, the Gyrtonii. EPIT.\r\n\r\n17. The city Dium is not on the sea-shore of the Thermæan Gulf, at the\r\nroots of Olympus, but is about 7 stadia distant. Near Dium is a village\r\nPimplea, where Orpheus lived. EPIT.\r\n\r\n18. Beneath Olympus is Dium; near it is a village, Pimplea, where it is\r\nsaid Orpheus lived. He was a Cicon (of the tribe of the Cicones) and was\r\na diviner. At first he drew people about him by the practice of music\r\nand witchcraft, and by the introduction of mysterious ceremonies in\r\nreligious worship. After a time, obtaining a greater degree of\r\nself-importance, he collected a multitude of followers, and acquired\r\ninfluence. He had many willing followers, but becoming suspected by a\r\nfew of entertaining secret designs, and of an intention of taking\r\nforcible possession of power, he was attacked by them and put to death.\r\nNear this place is Libethra. E.\r\n\r\n19. Anciently diviners practised the art of music. EPIT.\r\n\r\n20. After Dium follow the mouths of the Haliacmon; then Pydna, Methone,\r\nAlorus, and the rivers Erigon and Ludias. The Ludias flows from\r\nTriclari, through the Oresti and the Pellæan country (Pelagonia):\r\nleaving the city on the left it falls into the Axius. The Ludias is\r\nnavigable up the stream to Pella 120 stadia. Methone is situated in the\r\nmiddle, about 40 stadia distant from Pydna, and 70 stadia from Alorus.\r\nAlorus is situated in the farthest recess of the Thermæan Gulf. It was\r\ncalled Thessalonica on account of the splendid [victory obtained over\r\nthe Thessalians]. Alorus is considered as belonging to Bottiæa and Pydna\r\nto Pieria. Pella is in Lower Macedonia, which was in possession of the\r\nBottiæi. Here was formerly the Macedonian Treasury. Philip, who was\r\nbrought up in this place, raised it from an inconsiderable city to some\r\nimportance. It has a citadel situated on a lake called Ludias. From this\r\nlake issues the river Ludias, which is filled by a branch of the Axius.\r\nThe Axius discharges itself between Chalastra and Therma. Near this\r\nriver is a fortified place, now called Abydos; Homer calls it Amydon,\r\nand says that the Pæonians came from hence to assist the Trojans during\r\nthe siege of Troy.\r\n\r\n   “From afar, from Amydon, from Axius’ wide stream.”\r\n\r\nIt was razed by the Argeadæ. E.\r\n\r\n21. The water of the Axius is turbid. Homer, however, says that the\r\nwater is “most beautiful,” probably on account of a spring called Æa\r\nwhich runs into it, the water of which is of surpassing clearness. This\r\nis sufficient to prove that the present reading in the poem is\r\nerroneous. After the Axius is the Echedorus,[2891] 20 stadia distant.\r\nThen Thessalonica, founded by Cassander, 40 stadia farther on, and the\r\nEgnatian Way. He named the city after his wife Thessalonice, the\r\ndaughter of Philip Amyntas, and pulled down nearly 26 cities in the\r\ndistrict of Crucis, and on the Thermæan Gulf, collecting the inhabitants\r\ninto one city. It is the metropolis of the present Macedonia. The cities\r\ntransferred to Thessalonica were Apollonia, Chalastra, Therma, Garescus,\r\nÆnea, and Cissus. Cissus, it is probable, belonged to Cisseus, who is\r\nmentioned by the poet. “Cisseus educated him,” meaning Iphidamas. E.\r\n\r\n22. After the city Drium is the river Haliacmon, which discharges itself\r\ninto the Thermæan Gulf. From hence to the river Axius the sea-coast on\r\nthe north of the gulf bears the name of Pieria, on which is situated the\r\ncity Pydna, now called Citrum. Then follow Methone and the river Alorus;\r\nthen the rivers Erigon and Ludias. From Ludias to the city Pella the\r\nriver is navigated upwards to the distance of 20 stadia. Methone is\r\ndistant from Pydna 40 stadia, and 70 stadia from Alorus. Pydna is a\r\nPierian, Alorus a Bottiæan city. In the plain of Pydna the Romans\r\ndefeated Perseus, and put an end to the Macedonian empire. In the plain\r\nof Methone, during the siege of the city, Philip Amyntas accidentally\r\nlost his right eye by an arrow discharged from a catapult. EPIT.\r\n\r\n23. Philip, who was brought up at Pella, formerly a small city, much\r\nimproved it. In front of the city is a lake, out of which flows the\r\nriver Ludias. The lake is supplied by a branch of the river Axius. Next\r\nfollows the Axius, which separates the territory of Bottiæa and\r\nAmphaxitis, and after receiving the river Erigon, issues out between\r\nChalestra and Therme. On the river Axius is a place which Homer calls\r\nAmydon, and says that the Pæones set out thence as auxiliaries to Troy:\r\n\r\n   “From afar, from Amydon, from Axius’ wide stream.”\r\n\r\nThe Axius is a turbid river, but as a spring of clearest water rises in\r\nAmydon, and mingles with the Axius, some have altered the line\r\n\r\n   Ἀξιοῦ, οὗ κάλλιστον ὕδωρ ἐπικίδναται Αἶαν,\r\n   “Axius, whose fairest water o’erspreads Æa,”\r\nto\r\n\r\n   Ἀξιοῦ, ᾧ κάλλιστον ὕδωρ ἐπικίδναται Αἴης.\r\n   “Axius, o’er whom spreads Æa’s fairest water.”\r\n\r\nFor it is not the “fairest water” which is diffused over the spring, but\r\nthe “fairest water” of the spring which is diffused over the\r\nAxius.[2892] EPIT.\r\n\r\n24. After the river Axius is the city Thessalonica, formerly called\r\nTherma. It was founded by Cassander, who called it after the name of his\r\nwife, a daughter of Philip Amyntas. He transferred to it the small\r\nsurrounding cities, Chalastra, Ænea, Cissus, and some others. Probably\r\nfrom this Cissus came Iphidamas, mentioned in Homer, “whose grandfather\r\nCisseus educated him,” he says, “in Thrace,” which is now called\r\nMacedonia. EPIT.\r\n\r\n25. Somewhere in this neighbourhood is the mountain Bermius,[2893] which\r\nwas formerly in the possession of the Briges, a Thracian nation, some of\r\nwhom passed over to Asia and were called by another name, Phrygians\r\n(Phryges). After Thessalonica follows the remaining part of the Thermæan\r\nGulf,[2894] extending to Canastræum.[2895] This is a promontory of a\r\npeninsula form, and is opposite to Magnesia. Pallene is the name of the\r\npeninsula. It has an isthmus 5 stadia in width, with a ditch cut across\r\nit. There is a city on the peninsula, formerly called Potidæa,[2896]\r\nfounded by the Corinthians, but afterwards it was called Cassandria,\r\nfrom king Cassander, who restored it after it was demolished. It is a\r\ncircuit of 570 stadia round the peninsula by sea. Here giants were said\r\nto have lived, and the region to have been called Phlegra. Some consider\r\nthis to be a mere fable, but others, with greater probability on their\r\nside, see implied in it the existence of a barbarous and lawless race of\r\npeople who once occupied the country, but who were destroyed by Hercules\r\non his return home, after the capture of Troy. Here also the Trojan\r\nwomen are said to have committed the destructive act of burning the\r\nships, to avoid becoming the slaves of their captors’ wives. E.\r\n\r\n26. The city Berœa[2897] lies at the roots of Mount Bermius. EPIT.\r\n\r\n27. Pallene is a peninsula. On the isthmus of Pallene lies what was once\r\nPotidæa, but now Cassandra. It was formerly called Phlegra, and was\r\ninhabited by the fabulous giants, an impious and lawless race, who were\r\ndestroyed by Hercules. It has upon it four cities, Aphytis, Mende,\r\nScione, and Sana. EPIT.\r\n\r\n28. Olynthus is distant from Potidæa 70 stadia. E.\r\n\r\n29. The arsenal of Olynthus is Mecyberna, on the Toronæan Gulf. EPIT.\r\n\r\n30. Near Olynthus is a hollow tract called Cantharolethron, from an\r\naccidental circumstance. The Cantharus, (the beetle,) which is bred in\r\nthe surrounding country, dies as soon as it touches this tract. EPIT.\r\n\r\n31. Next after Cassandria is the remaining part of the sea-coast of the\r\nToronæan Gulf, as far as Derris. It is a promontory opposite the\r\ndistrict of Canastrum, and forms a gulf. Opposite to Derris, to the\r\neast, are the promontories of Athos; between them is the Singitic Gulf,\r\nwhich receives its name from an ancient city in it, Singus, now\r\ndestroyed. Next is the city Acanthus, situated on the isthmus of\r\nAthos,[2898] founded by the Andrii; whence, by many, it is called the\r\nAcanthian Gulf. E.\r\n\r\n32. Opposite to Canastrum, a promontory of Pallene, is the promontory\r\nDerris, near Cophus-Limen [or Deaf Harbour]: these form the boundaries\r\nof the Toronæan Gulf. Again, towards the east lies the promontory of\r\nAthos, [Nymphæum,] which bounds the Singitic Gulf. Then follow one\r\nanother the gulfs of the Ægean Sea, towards the north, in this order:\r\nthe Maliac,[2899] the Pagasitic,[2900] the Thermæan,[2901] the\r\nToronæan,[2902] the Singitic,[2903] and the Strymonic.[2904] The\r\npromontories are these: Posidium,[2905] situated between the Maliac and\r\nPegasitic Gulfs; next in order, towards the north, Sepias;[2906] then\r\nCanastrum[2907] in Pallene; then Derris;[2908] next Nymphæum[2909] in\r\nAthos, on the Singitic Gulf; Acrathos,[2910] the promontory on the\r\nStrymonic Gulf; between them is Athos, to the east of which is Lemnos.\r\nNeapolis[2911] bounds the Strymonic Gulf towards the north. EPIT.\r\n\r\n33. The city Acanthus, on the Singitic Gulf, is a maritime city near the\r\nCanal of Xerxes. There are five cities in Athos; Dium, Cleonæ, Thyssos,\r\nOlophyxis, Acrothoi, which is situated near the summit of Athos. Mount\r\nAthos is pap-shaped, very pointed, and of very great height. Those who\r\nlive upon the summit see the sun rise three hours before it is visible\r\non the sea-shore. The voyage round the peninsula, from the city Acanthus\r\nto the city Stagirus, the birth-place of Aristotle, is 400 stadia. It\r\nhas a harbour called Caprus, and a small island of the same name. Then\r\nfollow the mouths of the Strymon; then Phagres, Galepsus, and Apollonia,\r\nall of them cities; then the mouth of the Nestus, which is the boundary\r\nof Macedonia and Thrace, as settled, in their own times, by Philip and\r\nAlexander his son. There are about the Strymonic Gulf other cities also,\r\nas Myrcinus, Argilus, Drabescus, and Datum, which has an excellent and\r\nmost productive soil, dockyards for ship-building, and gold mines;\r\nwhence the proverb, “A Datum of good things,” like to the proverb,\r\n“Piles of plenty.”[2912] EPIT.\r\n\r\n34. There are numerous gold mines among the Crenides, where the city of\r\nPhilip now stands, near Mount Pangæus. Pangæus itself, and the country\r\non the east of the Strymon, and on the west as far as Pæonia, contains\r\ngold and silver mines. Particles of gold, it is said, are found in\r\nPæonia in ploughing the land. EPIT.\r\n\r\n35. Mount Athos is pap-shaped, and so lofty that the husbandmen on the\r\nsummit are already weary of their labour, the sun having long since\r\nrisen to them, when to the inhabitants of the shore it is the beginning\r\nof cockcrowing. Thamyris, the Thracian, was king of this coast, and\r\nfollowed the same practices as Orpheus. Here also, at Acanthus, is seen\r\nthe canal, which Xerxes is said to have made, and through which he is\r\nsaid to have brought the sea from the Strymonic Gulf, across the\r\nisthmus. Demetrius of Skepsis is of opinion that this canal was not\r\nnavigable; for, says he, the ground is composed of deep earth, and\r\nadmits of being dug for a distance of 10 stadia only: the canal is a\r\nplethrum in width; then follows a high, broad, and flat rock, nearly a\r\nstadium in length, which prevents excavation throughout the whole\r\ndistance to the sea. And even if the work could be carried on so far\r\nacross, yet it could not be continued to a sufficient depth, so as to\r\npresent a navigable passage. Here Alexarchus, the son of Antipater,\r\nbuilt the city Uranopolis, 30 stadia in circumference.\r\n\r\nThis peninsula was inhabited by Pelasgi from Lemnos; they were\r\ndistributed into five small cities, Cleonæ, Olophyxis, Acrothoi, Dium,\r\nThyssos. After Athos comes the Strymonic Gulf, extending to the river\r\nNestus, which forms the boundary of Macedonia, as settled by Philip and\r\nAlexander. Accurately speaking, there is a promontory forming a gulf\r\nwith Athos, on which is the city Apollonia. First in the gulf, after the\r\nharbour of Acanthus, is Stagira, now deserted: it was one of the\r\nChalcidic cities, and the birth-place of Aristotle. Caprus was the\r\nharbour, and there is a small island of the same name. Then comes the\r\nStrymon, and Amphipolis, at the distance of 20 stadia up the river. In\r\nthis part is situated an Athenian colony, called Ennea-Odoi (the\r\nNine-Ways). Then Galepsus and Apollonia, which were destroyed by Philip.\r\nE.\r\n\r\n36. He says, it is 120 stadia (300?) from the Peneus to Pydna. On the\r\nsea-coast of the Strymon and of the Dateni is Neapolis, and Datum also,\r\nwhich has fruitful plains, a lake, rivers, dockyards, and valuable gold\r\nmines. Hence the proverb, “A Datum of good things,” like “Piles of\r\nplenty.” The country beyond the Strymon, which borders upon the sea and\r\nincludes the parts about Datum, is occupied by Odomantes, Edoni, and\r\nBisaltæ, some of whom are an indigenous people, the others came from\r\nMacedonia and were under the government of Rhesus. Above Amphipolis live\r\nthe Bisaltæ, extending to the city Heraclea (Sintica); they occupy a\r\nfertile valley, through which passes the Strymon, which rises among the\r\nAgrianes near Rhodope. Near the Agrianes is situated Parorbelia of\r\nMacedonia. In the interior, in a valley, which commences at Idomene, are\r\nsituated Callipolis, Orthopolis, Philippopolis, and Garescus. Among the\r\nBisaltæ, proceeding up the river Strymon, is situated Berga, a village,\r\ndistant from Amphipolis about 200 stadia. Proceeding northwards from\r\nHeraclea, and to the narrows, through which the Strymon flows, keeping\r\nthe river on the right, first on the left are Pæonia and the parts about\r\nDobera; then on the right are the mountains Hæmus and Rhodope, with the\r\nadjacent parts. On this side of the Strymon, close upon the river, is\r\nScotussa; near the lake Bolbe is Arethusa; the inhabitants above the\r\nlake are chiefly Mygdones. Not only is the course of the Axius through\r\nPæonia, but that of the Strymon also; for it rises among the Agrianes,\r\npasses through the territory of the Mædi and Sinti, and discharges\r\nitself between the Bisaltæ and Odomantes. E.\r\n\r\n37. The source of the river Strymon is among the Agrianes near Rhodope.\r\nEPIT.\r\n\r\n38. The Pæonians, according to some, were a dependent colony of the\r\nPhrygians; according to others, they were an independent settlement.\r\nPæonia, it is said, extended to Pelagonia and Pieria; Pelagonia is said\r\nto have been formerly called Orestia; and Asteropæus, one of the chiefs\r\nfrom Pæonia who went to Troy, to have been called, with great\r\nprobability, the son of Pelagon, and the Pæonians themselves to have\r\nbeen called Pelagones. E.\r\n\r\n39. The Asteropæus in Homer, son of Pelegon, we are told, was of Pæonia\r\nin Macedonia: whence “Son of Pelegon;” for the Pæonians were called\r\nPelagones. EPIT.\r\n\r\n40. As the _pæanismus_, or singing of the Thracian Pæan, was called\r\n_titanismus_ by the Greeks, in imitation of a well-known note in the\r\npæan, so the Pelagones were called Titanes. E.\r\n\r\n41. Anciently, as at present, the Pæonians appear to have been masters\r\nof so much of what is now called Macedonia as to be able to besiege\r\nPerinthus, and subject to their power Crestonia, the whole of Mygdonia,\r\nand the territory of the Agrianes as far as Mount Pangæus. Above the\r\nsea-coast of the Strymonic Gulf, extending from Galepsus to Nestus, are\r\nsituated Philippi and the surrounding country. Philippi was formerly\r\ncalled Crenides; it was a small settlement, but increased after the\r\ndefeat of Brutus and Cassius. E.\r\n\r\n43.[2913] The present city Philippi was anciently called Crenides. EPIT.\r\n\r\n44. In front of this coast lie two islands, Lemnos and Thasos. Beyond\r\nthe strait at Thasos is Abdera, with its fables. It was inhabited by\r\nBistones, over whom ruled Diomed. The Nestus does not always keep within\r\nits banks, but frequently inundates the country. Then Dicæa, a city on\r\nthe gulf, with a harbour. Above it is the lake Bistonis, 200 stadia in\r\ncircumference. They say that Hercules, when he came to seize upon the\r\nhorses of Diomed, cut a canal through the sea-shore and turned the water\r\nof the sea upon the plain, which is situated in a hollow, and is lower\r\nthan the level of the sea, and thus vanquished his opponents. The royal\r\nresidence of Diomed is shown, called, from a local peculiarity, its\r\nnatural strength, Cartera-Come [Strong-Village]. Beyond the inland lake\r\nare Xanthia, Maronia, and Ismarus, cities of the Cicones. Ismarus is now\r\ncalled Ismara-near-Maronia. Near it is the outlet of the lake Ismaris.\r\nThe stream is called sweet * * * * * * At this place are what are called\r\nthe heads of the Thasii. The Sapæi are situated above. E.\r\n\r\n45. Topeira is situated near Abdera and Maronia. E.\r\n\r\n46. The Sinti, a Thracian tribe, inhabit the island of Lemnos; whence\r\nHomer calls them Sinties, thus, “There are the Sinties.” EPIT.\r\n\r\n47. After the river Nestus to the west is the city Abdera, named after\r\nAbderus, who was eaten by the horses of Diomed; then, near, Dicæa, a\r\ncity, above which is situated a large lake, the Bistonis; then the city\r\nMaronia. EPIT.\r\n\r\n48. The whole of Thrace is composed of twenty-two nations. Although\r\ngreatly exhausted, it is capable of equipping 15,000 cavalry and 20,000\r\ninfantry. After Maronia are Orthagoria, a city, and the district of\r\nSerrium (the navigation along the coast is difficult); the small city\r\nTempyra belonging to the Samothracians, and another Caracoma, (the\r\nStockade,) in front of which lies the island Samothrace. Imbros is at no\r\ngreat distance from Samothrace; Thasos is double the distance from it.\r\nAfter Caracoma is Doriscus, where Xerxes counted the number of his army.\r\nThen the Hebrus, with a navigation up the stream for 100 stadia to\r\nCypsela. Strabo says that this was the boundary of Macedonia when\r\nwrested by the Romans, first from Perseus, and afterwards from\r\nPseudophilip. Paulus, who overthrew Perseus, united the Epirotic nations\r\nto Macedonia, and divided the country into four parts; one he assigned\r\nto Amphipolis, a second to Thessalonica, a third to Pella, and a fourth\r\nto Pelagonia. Along the Hebrus dwell the Corpili, the Brenæ still higher\r\nup, above them, and lastly the Bessi, for the Hebrus is navigable up to\r\nthis point. All these nations are addicted to plunder, particularly the\r\nBessi, whom, he says, border upon the Odrysæ and Sapæi. Bizya is the\r\ncapital of the Astæ (?). Some give the name of Odrysæ to all those\r\npeople who live on the mountains overhanging the coast, from the Hebrus\r\nand Cypsela to Odessus. They were under the kingly government of\r\nAmadocus, Khersobleptes, Berisades, Seuthes, (Theseus?) and Cotys. E.\r\n\r\n49. The river in Thrace now called Rhiginia (Rhegina?) was formerly\r\ncalled Erigon (Erginus?). EPIT.\r\n\r\n50. Samothrace was inhabited by the brothers Jasion and Dardanus. Jasion\r\nwas killed by lightning, for his crime against Ceres; Dardanus moved\r\naway from Samothrace, and built a city, to which he gave the name of\r\nDardania, at the foot of Mount Ida. He taught the Trojans the\r\nSamothracian mysteries. Samothrace was formerly called Samos. EPIT.\r\n\r\n51. The gods worshipped in Samothrace, the Curbantes and Corybantes, the\r\nCuretes and the Idæan Dactyli, are said by many persons to be the same\r\nas the Cabiri, although they are unable to explain who the Cabiri were.\r\nE.\r\n\r\n52. At the mouth of the Hebrus, which discharges itself by two channels,\r\nin the Gulf of Melas, is a city Ænos, founded by the Mitylenæans and\r\nCumæans; its first founders, however, were Alopeconnesi; then the\r\npromontory Sarpedon; then the Chersonesus, called the Thracian\r\nChersonesus, forming the Propontis, the Gulf of Melas, and the\r\nHellespont. It stretches forwards to the south-east, like a promontory,\r\nbringing Europe and Asia together, with only a strait between them of 7\r\nstadia in width, the Strait of Sestos and Abydos. On the left is the\r\nPropontis, on the right the Gulf Melas,[2914] so called from the river\r\nMelas,[2915] which discharges itself into it, according to Herodotus and\r\nEudoxus. It is stated (says Strabo) by Herodotus, that the stream of\r\nthis river was not sufficient to supply the army of Xerxes. The above\r\npromontory is closed in by an isthmus 40 stadia across. In the middle of\r\nthe isthmus is situated the city Lysimachia, named after king\r\nLysimachus, its founder. On one side of the isthmus, on the Gulf Melas,\r\nlies Cardia; its first founders were Milesians and Clazomenæans, its\r\nsecond founders Athenians. It is the largest of the cities in the\r\nChersonesus. Pactya is on the Propontis. After Cardia are Drabus and\r\nLimnæ; then Alopeconnesus, where the Gulf Melas principally ends; then\r\nthe great promontory Mazusia; then, in the gulf, Eleus, where is\r\nProtesilaum, from whence Sigeum, a promontory of Troas, is 40 stadia\r\ndistant; this is about the most southern extremity of the Chersonesus,\r\ndistant from Cardia rather more than 400 stadia; if the circuit is made\r\nby sea to the other side of the isthmus, the distance is a little\r\ngreater. E.\r\n\r\n53. The Thracian Chersonesus forms three seas, the Propontis to the\r\nnorth, the Hellespont to the east, and the Gulf Melas to the south,\r\nwhere the river Melas, of the same name as the gulf, discharges itself.\r\nEPIT.\r\n\r\n54. In the isthmus of the Chersonesus are three cities, Cardia on the\r\nGulf of Melas, Pactya on the Propontis, Lysimachia in the interior; the\r\nbreadth of the isthmus is 40 stadia. EPIT.\r\n\r\n55. The name of the city Eleus is of the masculine gender, perhaps that\r\nof Trapezus is also masculine. EPIT.\r\n\r\n56. In the voyage round of which we have been speaking; beyond Eleus,\r\nfirst, is the entrance into the Propontis through the straits, where\r\nthey say the Hellespont begins. There is a promontory here by some\r\ncalled Dog’s Monument, by others the Monument of Hecuba, for on doubling\r\nthe promontory, the place of her burial is to be seen. Then Madytus and\r\nthe promontory of Sestos, where was the Bridge of Xerxes; after these\r\nplaces comes Sestos. From Eleus to the Bridge it is 170 stadia; after\r\nSestos it is 280 stadia to Ægospotamos: it is a small city in ruins. At\r\nthis place a stone is said to have fallen from heaven during the Persian\r\nwar. Then Callipolis, from whence to Lampsacus in Asia is a passage\r\nacross of 40 stadia; then a small city Crithote in ruins; then Pactya;\r\nnext Macron-Tichos, and Leuce-Acte, and Hieron-Oros, and Perinthus, a\r\ncolony of the Samians; then Selybria. Above these places is situated\r\nSilta. Sacred rites are performed in honour of Hieron-Oros by the\r\nnatives, which is as it were the citadel of the country. It discharges\r\nasphaltus into the sea. Proconnesus here approaches nearest the\r\ncontinent, being 120 stadia distant; there is a quarry of white marble\r\nin it, which is plentiful and of good quality; after Selybria the rivers\r\nAthyras and [Bathynias]; then Byzantium and the parts reaching to the\r\nCyanean rocks. E.\r\n\r\n57. From Perinthus to Byzantium it is 630 stadia; from the Hebrus and\r\nCypseli to Byzantium and the Cyanean rocks it is, according to\r\nArtemidorus, 3100 stadia. The whole distance from Apollonia on the\r\nIonian Gulf to Byzantium is 7320 stadia; Polybius makes this distance\r\n180 stadia more, by the addition of a third of a stadium to the sum of 8\r\nstadia, which compose a mile. Demetrius of Skepsis, in his account of\r\nthe disposition of the Trojan forces, says that it is 700 stadia from\r\nPerinthus to Byzantium, and the same distance to Parium. He makes the\r\nlength of the Propontis to be 1400 and the breadth 500 stadia; the\r\nnarrowest part also of the Hellespont to be 7 stadia, and the length\r\n400. E.\r\n\r\n58. All writers do not agree in their description of the Hellespont, and\r\nmany opinions are advanced on the subject. Some describe the Propontis\r\nto be the Hellespont; others, that part of the Propontis which is to the\r\nsouth of Perinthus; others include a part of the exterior sea which\r\nopens to the Ægæan and the Gulf Melas, each assigning different limits.\r\nSome make their measurement from Sigeum to Lampsacus, and Cyzicus, and\r\nParium, and Priapus; and one is to be found who measures from Singrium,\r\na promontory of Lesbos. Some do not hesitate to give the name of\r\nHellespont to the whole distance as far as the Myrtoan Sea, because (as\r\nin the Odes of Pindar) when Hercules sailed from Troy through the\r\nvirgin strait of Hella, and arrived at the Myrtoan Sea, he returned back\r\nto Cos, in consequence of the wind Zephyrus blowing contrary to his\r\ncourse. Thus some consider it correct to apply the name Hellespont to\r\nthe whole of the Ægæan Sea, and the sea along the coast of Thessaly and\r\nMacedonia, invoking the testimony of Homer, who says,\r\n\r\n   “Thou shalt see, if such thy will, in spring,\r\n   My ships shall sail to Hellespont.”\r\n\r\nBut the argument is contradicted in the following lines,\r\n\r\n   “Piros, Imbracius’ son, who came from Ænos.”\r\n\r\nPiros commanded the Thracians,\r\n\r\n   “Whose limits are the quick-flowing Hellespont.”\r\n\r\nSo that he would consider all people settled next to the Thracians as\r\nexcluded from the Hellespont. For Ænos is situated in the district\r\nformerly called Apsynthis, but now Corpilice. The territory of the\r\nCicones is next towards the west. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

These references relate to the Greek text; any\r\none wishing to verify the poetic translation will find the place in\r\nCowper, by adding a few lines to the number adapted to the Greek. The\r\nprose version is taken from Bohn’s edition.\r\n\r\n[5] And the bright light of the sun fell into the ocean, drawing dark\r\nnight over the fruitful earth. Iliad viii. 485.\r\n\r\n[6]         “Bright and steady as the star\r\n     Autumnal, which in ocean newly bathed,\r\n     Assumes fresh beauty.”      Iliad v. 6.\r\n\r\n[7] Gosselin remarks that in his opinion Strabo frequently attributes to\r\nHomer much information of which the great poet was entirely ignorant:\r\nthe present is an instance, for Spain was to Homer a perfect _terra\r\nincognita_.\r\n\r\n[8] The Phœnician Hercules, anterior to the Grecian hero by two or three\r\ncenturies.

There is nor snow, nor long winter,\r\nnor even a shower, but every day the ocean sends forth the gently\r\nblowing breezes of the west wind to refresh men.” Odyssey iv. 563.\r\n\r\n[10] The Isles of the Blest are the same as the Fortunate Isles of other\r\ngeographers. It is clear from Strabo’s description that he alludes to\r\nthe Canary Islands; but as it is certain that Homer had never heard of\r\nthese, it is probable that the passages adduced by Strabo have reference\r\nto the Elysian Fields of Baia in Campania.\r\n\r\n[11] The Maurusia of the Greeks (the Mauritania of the Latins) is now\r\nknown as Algiers and Fez in Africa.\r\n\r\n[12] The Ethiopians, who are divided into two divisions, the most\r\ndistant of men. Odyssey i. 23.\r\n\r\n[13] For yesterday Jove went to Oceanus, to the blameless Ethiopians, to\r\na banquet. Iliad i. 423. The ancients gave the name of Ethiopians,\r\ngenerally, to the inhabitants of Interior Africa, the people who\r\noccupied the sea-coast of the Atlantic, and the shores of the Arabian\r\nGulf. It is with this view of the name that Strabo explains the passage\r\nof Homer; but the Mediterranean was the boundary of the poet’s\r\ngeographical knowledge; and the people he speaks of were doubtless the\r\ninhabitants of the southern parts of Phœnicia, who at one time were\r\ncalled Ethiopians. We may here remark too, that Homer’s ocean frequently\r\nmeans the Mediterranean, sometimes probably the Nile. See also p. 48,\r\n_n._ 2.\r\n\r\n[14] But it alone is free from the baths of the ocean. Iliad xviii. 489;\r\nOdyssey v. 275.\r\n\r\n[15] We are informed by Diogenes Laertius, that Thales was the first to\r\nmake known to the Greeks the constellation of the Lesser Bear. Now this\r\nphilosopher flourished 600 years before the Christian era, and\r\nconsequently some centuries after Homer’s death. The name of Φοινίκη\r\nwhich it received from the Greeks, is proof that Thales owed his\r\nknowledge of it to the Phœnicians. Conf. Humboldt’s Cosmos, vol. iii. p.\r\n160, Bohn’s edition.\r\n\r\n[16] Iliad xiii. 5. Gosselin says, Thrace (the present Roumelia) was\r\nindisputably the most northern nation known to Homer. He names the\r\npeople Ἱππημόλγοι, or living on mares’ milk, because in his time they\r\nwere a nomade race. Strabo evidently gives a forced meaning to the words\r\nof the poet, when he attempts to prove his acquaintance with the\r\nScythians and Sarmatians.\r\n\r\n[17] For I go to visit the limits of the fertile earth, and Oceanus, the\r\nparent of the gods.

Odyss. xii. 105.\r\n\r\nGosselin remarks, “I do not find any thing in these different passages\r\nof Homer to warrant the conclusion that he was aware of the ebb and flow\r\nof the tide; every one knows that the movement is hardly perceptible in\r\nthe Mediterranean. In the Euripus, which divides the Isle of Negropont\r\nfrom Bœotia, the waters are observed to flow in opposite directions\r\nseveral times a day. It was from this that Homer probably drew his\r\nideas; and the regular current of the Hellespont, which carries the\r\nwaters of the Black Sea into the Mediterranean, led him to think that\r\nthe whole ocean, or Mediterranean, had one continued flow like the\r\ncurrent of a river.”\r\n\r\n[21] Iliad vii. 422.\r\n\r\n[22] But when the ship left the stream of the river-ocean, and entered\r\non the wave of the wide-wayed sea. Odyssey xii. 1.\r\n\r\n[23] This direction would indicate a gulf, the sea-ward side of which\r\nshould be opposite the Libo-notus of the ancients. Now the mutilated\r\npassage of Crates has reference to the opening of the twelfth book of\r\nthe Odyssey, descriptive of Ulysses’ departure from Cimmeria, after his\r\nvisit to the infernal regions. Those Cimmerians were the people who\r\ninhabited Campania, and the land round Baia, near to lake Avernus, and\r\nthe entrance into Hades. As these places are situated close to the bay\r\nof Naples, which occupies the exact position described by Crates, it is\r\nprobable this was the bay he intended.\r\n\r\n[24] What Strabo calls the eastern side of the continent, comprises that\r\nportion of India between Cape Comorin and Tana-serim, to the west of the\r\nkingdom of Siam: further than which he was not acquainted.\r\n\r\n[25] Strabo’s acquaintance with Western Africa did not go further than\r\nCape Nun, 214 leagues distant from the Strait of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[26] By the south is intended the whole land from the Arabian Gulf or\r\nRed Sea to Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\n[27] From Cape Finisterre to the mouth of the Elbe.\r\n\r\n[28] The rocks of Gibraltar and Ceuta.\r\n\r\n[29] The mountaineers of the Taurus, between Lycia and Pisidia.\r\n\r\n[30] A mountain of Ionia near to the Meander, and opposite the Isle of\r\nSamos.\r\n\r\n[31] The Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[32] The Strait of Caffa, which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of\r\nAzof.\r\n\r\n[33] The Cimmerians, spoken of in Homer, were undoubtedly the\r\ninhabitants of Campania, not those of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\n[34] They are covered with shadows and darkness, nor does the shining\r\nsun behold them with his beams, ... but pernicious night is spread over\r\nhapless mortals. Odyssey xi. 15 and 19.\r\n\r\n[35] The Danube.\r\n\r\n[36] Ancient Thrace consisted of the modern provinces of Bulgaria and\r\nRoumelia.\r\n\r\n[37] A river of Thessaly, named at present Salampria.\r\n\r\n[38] Now the river Vardari.\r\n\r\n[39] Thesprotis, in Epirus, opposite Corfu.\r\n\r\n[40] Afterwards named Temsa. This town was in Citerior Calabria. Some\r\nthink Torre de Nocera stands on the ancient site.\r\n\r\n[41] This is a misstatement, as before remarked.\r\n\r\n[42] This writer occupies so prominent a position in Strabo’s work, that\r\nno apology I think will be needed for the following extract from Smith’s\r\ndictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\r\n\r\n“Eratosthenes of Cyrene was, according to Suidas, the son of Aglaus,\r\naccording to others, the son of Ambrosius, and was born B. C. 276. He\r\nwas taught by Ariston of Chius, the philosopher, Lysanias of Cyrene, the\r\ngrammarian, and Callimachus, the poet. He left Athens at the invitation\r\nof Ptolemy Euergetes, who placed him over the library at Alexandria.\r\nHere he continued till the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes. He died at the\r\nage of eighty, about B. C. 196, of voluntary starvation, having lost his\r\nsight, and being tired of life. He was a man of very extensive learning:\r\nwe shall first speak of him as a geometer and astronomer.\r\n\r\n“It is supposed that Eratosthenes suggested to Ptolemy Euergetes the\r\nconstruction of the large _armillæ_, or fixed circular instruments,\r\nwhich were long in use at Alexandria; but only because it is difficult\r\nto imagine to whom else they are to be assigned, for Ptolemy the\r\nastronomer, though he mentions them, and incidentally their antiquity,\r\ndoes not state to whom they were due. In these circles each degree was\r\ndivided into six parts. We know of no observations of Eratosthenes in\r\nwhich they were probably employed, except those which led him to the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic, which he must have made to be 23° 51’ 20”,\r\nfor he states the distance of the tropics to be eleven times the\r\neighty-third part of the circumference. This was a good observation for\r\nthe times. Ptolemy the astronomer was content with it, and according to\r\nhim Hipparchus used no other. Of his measure of the earth we shall\r\npresently speak. According to Nicomachus, he was the inventor of the\r\nκόσκινον, or Cribrum Arithmeticum, as it has since been called, being\r\nthe well-known method of detecting the prime numbers by writing down all\r\nodd numbers which do not end with 5, and striking out successively the\r\nmultiples of each, one after the other, so that only prime numbers\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n“We still possess under the name of Eratosthenes a work, entitled\r\nΚαταστερισμοί, giving a slight account of the constellations, their\r\nfabulous history, and the stars in them. It is however acknowledged on\r\nall hands that this is not a work of Eratosthenes.... The only other\r\nwriting of Eratosthenes which remains, is a letter to Ptolemy on the\r\nduplication of the cube, for the mechanical performance of which he had\r\ncontrived an instrument, of which he seems to contemplate actual use in\r\nmeasuring the contents of vessels, &c. He seems to say that he has had\r\nhis method engraved in some temple or public building, with some verses,\r\nwhich he adds. Eutocius has preserved this letter in his comment on book\r\nii. prop. 2, of the sphere and cylinder of Archimedes.\r\n\r\n“The greatest work of Eratosthenes, and that which must always make his\r\nname conspicuous in scientific history, is the attempt which he made to\r\nmeasure the magnitude of the earth, in which he brought forward and used\r\nthe method which is employed to this day. Whether or no he was\r\nsuccessful cannot be told, as we shall see; but it is not the less true\r\nthat he was the originator of the process by which we now know, very\r\nnearly indeed, the magnitude of our own planet. Delambre says that if it\r\nwere he who advised the erection of the circular instruments above\r\nalluded to, he must be considered as the founder of astronomy: to which\r\nit may be added, that he was the founder of geodesy without any _if_ in\r\nthe case. The number of ancient writers who have alluded to this\r\nremarkable operation (which seems to have obtained its full measure of\r\nfame) is very great, and we shall not attempt to combine their remarks\r\nor surmises: it is enough to say that the most distinct account, and one\r\nof the earliest, is found in the remaining work of Cleomedes.\r\n\r\n“At Syene in Upper Egypt, which is supposed to be the same as, or near\r\nto, the town of Assouan, (Lat. 24° 10’ N., Long. 32° 59’ E. of\r\nGreenwich,) Eratosthenes was told (that he observed is very doubtful)\r\nthat deep wells were enlightened to the bottom on the day of the summer\r\nsolstice, and that vertical objects cast no shadows. He concluded\r\ntherefore, that Syene was on the tropic, and its latitude equal to the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic, which, as we have seen, he had determined: he\r\npresumed that it was in the same longitude as Alexandria, in which he\r\nwas out about 3°, which is not enough to produce what would at that time\r\nhave been a sensible error. By observations made at Alexandria, he\r\ndetermined the zenith of that place to be distant by the fiftieth part\r\nof the circumference from the solstice, which was equivalent to saying\r\nthat the arc of the meridian between the two places is 7° 12’. Cleomedes\r\nsays that he used the σκάφη, or hemispherical dial of Berosus, in the\r\ndetermination of this latitude. Delambre rejects the idea with infinite\r\nscorn, and pronounces Cleomedes unworthy of credit; and indeed it is not\r\neasy to see why Eratosthenes should have rejected the gnomon and the\r\nlarge circular instruments, unless, perhaps, for the following reason.\r\nThere is a sentiment of Cleomedes which seems to imply that the\r\ndisappearance of the shadows at Syene on the day of the summer solstice\r\nwas noticed to take place for 300 stadia every way round Syene. If\r\nEratosthenes took his report about the phenomenon (and we have no\r\nevidence that he went to Syene himself) from those who could give no\r\nbetter account than this, we may easily understand why he would think\r\nthe σκάφη quite accurate enough to observe with at his own end of the\r\narc, since the other end of it was uncertain by as much as 300 stadia.\r\nHe gives 500 stadia for the distance from Alexandria to Syene, and this\r\nround number seems further to justify us in concluding that he thought\r\nthe process to be as rough as in truth it was. Martianus Capella states\r\nthat he obtained this distance from the measures made by order of the\r\nPtolemies (which had been commenced by Alexander): this writer then\r\nimplies that Eratosthenes did not go to Syene himself.\r\n\r\n“The result is 250,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth, which\r\nEratosthenes altered into 252,000, that his result might give an exact\r\nnumber of stadia for the degree, namely, 700; this of course should have\r\nbeen 694-4/9. Pliny calls this 31,500 Roman miles, and therefore\r\nsupposes the stadium to be the eighth part of a Roman mile, or takes for\r\ngranted that Eratosthenes used the Olympic stadium. It is likely enough\r\nthat the Ptolemies naturalized this stadium in Egypt; but nevertheless,\r\nit is not unlikely that an Egyptian stadium was employed. If we assume\r\nthe Olympic stadium, (202¼ yards,) the degree of Eratosthenes is more\r\nthan 79 miles, upwards of 10 miles too great. Nothing is known of any\r\nEgyptian stadium. Pliny asserts that Hipparchus, but for what reason he\r\ndoes not say, wanted to add 25,000 stadia to the circumference as found\r\nby Eratosthenes. According to Plutarch, Eratosthenes made the sun to be\r\n804 millions of stadia from the earth, and the moon 780,000. According\r\nto Macrobius, he made the diameter of the sun to be 27 times that of the\r\nearth. With regard to the other merits of Eratosthenes, we must first of\r\nall mention what he did for geography, which was closely connected with\r\nhis mathematical pursuits. It was Eratosthenes who raised geography to\r\nthe rank of a science; for previous to his time it seems to have\r\nconsisted, more or less, of a mass of information scattered in books of\r\ntravel, descriptions of particular countries, and the like. All these\r\ntreasures were accessible to Eratosthenes in the libraries of\r\nAlexandria; and he made the most profitable use of them, by collecting\r\nthe scattered materials, and uniting them into an organic system of\r\ngeography, in his comprehensive work entitled Γεωγραφικά, or as it is\r\nsometimes but erroneously called, γεωγραφούμενα or γεωγραφία. It\r\nconsisted of three books, the first of which, forming a sort of\r\nIntroduction, contained a critical review of the labours of his\r\npredecessors from the earliest to his own times, and investigations\r\nconcerning the form and nature of the earth, which, according to him,\r\nwas an immoveable globe, on the surface of which traces of a series of\r\ngreat revolutions were still visible. He conceived that in one of these\r\nrevolutions the Mediterranean had acquired its present form; for\r\naccording to him it was at one time a large lake covering portions of\r\nthe adjacent countries of Asia and Libya, until a passage was forced\r\nopen by which it entered into communication with the ocean in the west.\r\nThe second book contained what is now called mathematical geography. His\r\nattempt to measure the magnitude of the earth has been spoken of above.\r\nThe third book contained the political geography, and gave descriptions\r\nof the various countries, derived from the works of earlier travellers\r\nand geographers. In order to be able to determine the accurate site of\r\neach place, he drew a line parallel with the equator, running from the\r\nPillars of Hercules to the extreme east of Asia, and dividing the whole\r\nof the inhabited earth into two halves. Connected with this work was a\r\nnew map of the earth, in which towns, mountains, rivers, lakes, and\r\nclimates were marked according to his own improved measurements. This\r\nimportant work of Eratosthenes forms an epoch in the history of ancient\r\ngeography; but unfortunately it is lost, and all that has survived\r\nconsists in fragments quoted by later geographers and historians, such\r\nas Polybius, Strabo, Marcianus, Pliny, and others, who often judge of\r\nhim unfavourably, and controvert his statements; while it can be proved\r\nthat in a great many passages they adopt his opinions without mentioning\r\nhis name. Marcianus charges Eratosthenes with having copied the\r\nsubstance of the work of Timosthenes on Ports, (περὶ λιμένων,) to which\r\nhe added but very little of his own. This charge may be well-founded,\r\nbut cannot have diminished the value of the work of Eratosthenes, in\r\nwhich that of Timosthenes can have formed only a very small portion. It\r\nseems to have been the very overwhelming importance of the geography of\r\nEratosthenes, that called forth a number of opponents, among whom we\r\nmeet with the names of Polemon, Hipparchus, Polybius, Serapion, and\r\nMarcianus of Heracleia.... Another work of a somewhat similar nature,\r\nentitled Ἑρμῆς, was written in verse, and treated of the form of the\r\nearth, its temperature, the different zones, the constellations, and the\r\nlike.... Eratosthenes distinguished himself also as a philosopher,\r\nhistorian, grammarian, &c.”\r\n\r\n[43] The ancients portioned out the globe by bands or zones parallel to\r\nthe equator, which they named κλίματα. The extent of each zone was\r\ndetermined by the length of the solstitial day, and thus each diminished\r\nin extent according as it became more distant from the equator. The\r\nmoderns have substituted a mode of reckoning the degrees by the\r\nelevation of the pole, which gives the latitudes with much greater\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\n[44] Literally, the heat, cold, and temperature of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[45] Tartary.\r\n\r\n[46] France.\r\n\r\n[47] Xylander and Casaubon remark that Strabo here makes an improper use\r\nof the term antipodes; the antipodes of Spain and India being in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[48] Meteorology, from μετέωρος, aloft, is the science which describes\r\nand explains the various phenomena which occur in the region of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n[49] Homer, Iliad viii. 16.\r\n\r\n[50] A people of Thessaly, on the banks of the Peneus.\r\n\r\n[51] The former name of the Morea, and more ancient than Peloponnesus.\r\nIliad i. 270.\r\n\r\n[52] Having wandered to Cyprus, and Phœnice, and the Egyptians, I came\r\nto the Ethiopians, and Sidonians, and Erembi, and Libya, where the lambs\r\nimmediately become horned. Odyssey iv. 83.\r\n\r\n[53] Odyssey iv. 86.\r\n\r\n[54] Homer says,\r\n\r\n   ——τῇ πλεῖστα φέρει ζείδωρος ἄρουρα\r\n   Φάρμακα.\r\n            Odyssey iv. 229.\r\n\r\nWhich Cowper properly renders:—\r\n\r\n                         “Egypt teems\r\n   with _drugs_ of various powers.”\r\n\r\nStrabo, by omitting the word φάρμακα from his citation, alters to a\r\ncertain degree the meaning of the sentence.\r\n\r\n[55] Iliad ix. 383, et seq.\r\n\r\n[56] Odyssey xxi. 26.\r\n\r\n[57] Chorography, a term used by Greek writers, meaning the description\r\nof particular districts.\r\n\r\n[58] Iliad ii. 496. Four cities of Bœotia. The present name of Aulis is\r\nVathi, situated on the Strait of Negropont. The modern names of the\r\nother three cities are unknown.\r\n\r\n[59] By Libyans are here intended Carthaginians. The events alluded to\r\nby Strabo may be found in Pomponius Mela and Valerius Maximus, whose\r\naccounts however do not entirely accord. That of Valerius Maximus, who\r\nis followed by Servius, tells us that Hannibal, on his return to Africa,\r\nobserved his pilot Pelorus was taking the ships by the coast of Italy,\r\nand suspecting him therefore of treachery, caused him to be executed. He\r\ndid not know at the time the intention of Pelorus to take him through\r\nthe Strait of Messina, but afterwards, when aware of the excellence of\r\nthe passage, caused a monument to be raised to the memory of the\r\nunfortunate pilot. Strabo, in his ninth book, gives us the history of\r\nSalganeus, and the monument erected to him on the shores of Negropont.\r\n\r\n[60] The Gulf of Zeitun.\r\n\r\n[61] Vide preceding note on this word p. 13, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[62] Odyssey v. 393.\r\n\r\n[63] Allusion is here made to the theory of Xenophanes of Colophon and\r\nAnaximenes his disciple, who imagined the earth bore the form of a vast\r\nmountain, inhabited at the summit, but whose roots stretched into\r\ninfinity. The Siamese at the present day hold a similar idea.\r\n\r\n[64] See note [43], p. 13.\r\n\r\n[65] Περὶ τῶν οἰκήσεων.\r\n\r\n[66] Meaning, the different appearances of the heavenly bodies at\r\nvarious parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n[67] Odyssey x. 190.\r\n\r\n[68] This sentence has been restored to what was evidently its original\r\nposition. In the Greek text it appears immediately before section 23,\r\ncommencing, “Having already compiled,” &c. The alteration is borne out\r\nby the French and German translators.\r\n\r\n[69] Strabo here alludes to his Ἱστορικὰ Ὑπομνήματα, cited by Plutarch\r\n(Lucullus, 28, Sulla, 26). This work, in forty-three books, began where\r\nthe History of Polybius ended, and was probably continued to the battle\r\nof Actium. Smith, Gr. and Rom. Biog.\r\n\r\n[70] The Sea of Azof.\r\n\r\n[71] Mingrelia; east of the Euxine.\r\n\r\n[72] A large country of Asia to the south of the eastern part of the\r\nCaspian Sea. It became much restricted during the Parthian rule,\r\ncontaining only the north of Comis, east of Masanderan, the country near\r\nCorcan or Jorjan, (Dshiordshian.) and the west of the province of\r\nKhorassan.\r\n\r\n[73] A country of Asia, on the west bounded by Aria, south by the\r\nmountains of Paropamisus, east by the Emodi montes, north by Sogdiana,\r\nnow belongs to the kingdom of Afghanistan. Bactriana was anciently the\r\ncentre of Asiatic commerce.\r\n\r\n[74] A general name given by the Greeks and Romans to a large portion of\r\nAsia, and divided by them into Scythia intra et extra Imaum, that is, on\r\neither side of Mount Imaus. This mountain is generally thought to answer\r\nto the Himalaya mountains of Thibet.\r\n\r\n[75] This seems to be a paraphrase of Homer’s verse on Ulysses, Odyssey\r\nxviii. 74.\r\n\r\n   Οἵην ἐκ ῥακέων ὁ γέρων ἐπιγουνίδα φαίνει.\r\n\r\n                         What thews\r\n   And what a haunch the senior’s tatters hide.\r\n\r\n   Cowper.\r\n\r\n[76] Zeno, of Citium, a city in the island of Cyprus, founded by\r\nPhœnician settlers, was the son of Mnaseas.\r\n\r\n[77] Περὶ τῶν Ἀγαθῶν is the title given by Strabo, but we find from\r\nHarpocrates and Clemens Alexandrinus, that properly it was Περὶ Ἀγαθῶν\r\nκαὶ Κακῶν, or “Concerning Good and Evil Things,” which we have rendered\r\nin the text “Moral Philosophy.”\r\n\r\n[78] Odyssey iii. 267.\r\n\r\n[79] Ib. iii. 270.\r\n\r\n[80] Ib. iii. 272.\r\n\r\n[81] Thisbe, Haliartus, Anthedon, cities of Bœotia; Litæa, a city of\r\nPhocis.

The song was likewise called\r\neiresionè, which became the general name for all begging-songs.\r\n\r\n[83] Auditors, ἀκροωμένοις. In Greece there was a class of lectures\r\nwhere the only duty of the professors was to explain the works of the\r\npoets, and point out the beauties which they contained. The students who\r\nattended these lectures were styled ἀκροάται, or auditors, and the\r\nmethod of instruction ἀκρόασις.\r\n\r\n[84] Odyssey i. 3.\r\n\r\n[85] Iliad iii. 202.\r\n\r\n[86] Ib. x. 246.\r\n\r\n[87] Odyssey xviii. 367.\r\n\r\n[88] Ib. xviii. 374.\r\n\r\n[89] The second book of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n[90] The ninth book of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n[91] The deputation of Menelaus and Ulysses to demand back Helen,\r\nalluded to by Antenor, in the third book of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n[92] But when he did send forth the mighty voice from his breast, and\r\nwords like unto wintry flakes of snow, no longer then would another\r\nmortal contend with Ulysses. Iliad iii. 221.\r\n\r\n[93] So much of the meaning of this sentence depends upon the\r\northography, that its force is not fully perceptible in English; the\r\nGreek is as follows: τοῦτο δ’ ἦν ἡ ᾠδὴ λόγος μεμελισμένος· ἀφ’ οὗ δὴ\r\nῥαψῳδίαν τ’ ἔλεγον καὶ τραγῳδίαν καὶ κωμῳδίαν.\r\n\r\n[94] This last sentence can convey little or no meaning to the English\r\nreader; its whole force in the original depending on verbal association.\r\nIts general scope however will be evident, when it is stated that in\r\nGreek, the same word, πεζὸς, which means a “foot-soldier,” signifies also\r\n“prose composition.” Hence Strabo’s allusion to the chariot. The Latins\r\nborrowed the expression, and used sermo pedestris in the same sense.\r\n\r\n[95] A female phantom said to devour children, used by nurses as a\r\nbug-bear to intimidate their refractory charges.\r\n\r\n[96] In later times there were three Gorgons, Stheino, Euryalé, and\r\nMedusa, but Homer seems to have known but one.\r\n\r\n[97] One of the giants, who in the war against the gods was deprived of\r\nhis left eye by Apollo, and of the right by Hercules.\r\n\r\n[98] The same phantom as Mormo, with which the Greeks used to frighten\r\nlittle children.\r\n\r\n[99] Odyssey vi. 232.\r\n\r\n[100] Odyssey xix. 203.\r\n\r\n[101] The mountains of Chimera in Albania.\r\n\r\n[102] The Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n[103] The Gulf of Salerno.\r\n\r\n[104] The Grecian name for Tuscany.\r\n\r\n[105] Several small islands, or rather reefs, at the entrance of the\r\nStrait of Constantinople. They took their name of Symplegades from the\r\nvarying positions they assumed to the eyes of the voyager, owing to the\r\nsinuosities of the Strait.\r\n\r\n[106] Unfortunately for Strabo’s illustration, no Grecian navigator had\r\never passed the Strait of Gibraltar in Homer’s time.\r\n\r\n[107] The powerful Shaker of the Earth, as he was returning from the\r\nEthiopians, beheld him from a distance, from the mountains of the\r\nSolymi. Odyssey v. 282.\r\n\r\n[108] There is some doubt as to the modern name of the island of Ithaca.\r\nD’Anville supposes it to be the island of Thiaki, between the island of\r\nCephalonia and Acarnania, while Wheeler and others, who object to this\r\nisland as being too large to answer the description of Ithaca given by\r\nStrabo, identify it with the little isle of Ithaco, between Thiaki and\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\n[109] A name of the city of Troy, from Ilus, son of Tros.\r\n\r\n[110] A mountain of Magnesia in Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[111] A mountain in the Troad.\r\n\r\n[112] Cape Faro in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[113] The stadia here mentioned are 700 to a degree; thus 2000 stadia\r\namount to rather more than 57 marine leagues, which is the distance in a\r\ndirect line from Capo Faro to the Capo della Minerva.\r\n\r\n[114] The Sirenussæ are the rocks which form the southern cape of the\r\nGulf of Naples, and at the same time separate it from the Gulf of\r\nSalerno. This cape, which was also called the promontory of Minerva,\r\nfrom the Athenæum which stood there, preserves to this day the name of\r\nCapo della Minerva.\r\n\r\n[115] Now Surrento.\r\n\r\n[116] The island of Capri is opposite to the Capo della Minerva.\r\n\r\n[117] Now the Island of St. Marcian.\r\n\r\n[118] Monte Circello, near to Terracina.\r\n\r\n[119] The Iliad.\r\n\r\n[120] Sword-fish.\r\n\r\n[121] And fishes there, watching about the rock for dolphins and dogs,\r\nand if she can any where take a larger whale.

From her middle\r\nprotrude two half-bodied dogs, who assist the monster in swimming.\r\n\r\n[123] Odyssey xii. 105.\r\n\r\n[124] At this place there was an altar consecrated to Ulysses.

Odyssey vi. 204.\r\n\r\n[132] Gosselin has satisfactorily demonstrated that Strabo is wrong in\r\nsupposing that these passages relate to the Atlantic Ocean, and most of\r\nour readers will come at once themselves to the same conclusion.

A portion of Macedonia still maintains its ancient name\r\nMakidunia.\r\n\r\n[157] The modern names of these places are Thaso, Stalimene, Imbro, and\r\nSamothraki.\r\n\r\n[158] Strabo, as well as Casaubon in his notes on this passage, seems to\r\nhave made an imperfect defence of Homer. The difficulty experienced, as\r\nwell by them as Eratosthenes, arose from their overlooking the fact that\r\nMacedonia was a part of Thrace in Homer’s time, and that the name of\r\nMacedon did not exist.\r\n\r\n[159] These rocks were situated between the city of Megara and the\r\nisthmus of Corinth.\r\n\r\n[160] And the south-east and the south rushed together, and the\r\nhard-blowing west, and the cold-producing north. Odyssey v. 295.\r\n\r\n[161] The western part of Thrace, afterwards named Macedonia; having\r\nPæonia on the north, and Thessaly on the south.\r\n\r\n[162] The Magnetæ dwelt near to Mount Pelion and the Pelasgic Gulf, now\r\nthe Bay of Volo.\r\n\r\n[163] These people dwelt between Mount Othrys, and the Maliac Gulf, now\r\nthe Gulf of Zeitun.\r\n\r\n[164] The maritime portion of Epirus opposite Corfu.\r\n\r\n[165] In the time of Homer the Dolopes were the neighbours of the\r\nPæonians, and dwelt in the north of that part of Thrace which afterwards\r\nformed Macedonia. Later, however, they descended into Thessaly, and\r\nestablished themselves around Pindus.\r\n\r\n[166] Dodona was in Epirus, but its exact position is not known.\r\n\r\n[167] Now Aspro-potamo, or the White River; this river flows into the\r\nsea at the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth.\r\n\r\n[168] And the assembly was moved, as the great waves of the Icarian sea.\r\nIliad ii. 144.\r\n\r\n[169] Ἀργέσταο Νότοιο, Iliad xi. 306, xxi. 334. Ἀργέστης strictly\r\nspeaking means the north-west, and although, to an English ear, the\r\nnorth-west south seems at first absurd, yet in following up the argument\r\nwhich Strabo is engaged in, it is impossible to make use of any other\r\nterms than those which he has brought forward, and merely to have\r\ntranslated ἀργέσταο Νότοιο by Argest-south, would have mystified the\r\npassage without cause. We do not here attempt to reconcile the various\r\nrenderings of ἀργέσταο Νότοιο by Homeric critics, as Strabo’s sense\r\nalone concerns us.\r\n\r\n[170] The north and west winds, which both blow from Thrace. Iliad ix.\r\n5.\r\n\r\n[171] Ἀργέστης Νότος, the clearing south wind, Horace’s Notus Albus;—in\r\nthe improved compass of Aristotle, ἀργέστης was the north-west wind, the\r\nAthenian σκείρων.\r\n\r\n[172] Τοῦ λοιποῦ Νότου ὅλου Εὔρου πως ὄντος. MSS. _i. e. all the other\r\nsouthern winds having an easterly direction_. We have adopted the\r\nsuggestion of Kramer, and translated the passage as if it stood thus,\r\nτοῦ λοιποῦ Νότου ὀλεροῦ πως ὄντος.\r\n\r\n[173] As when the west wind agitates the light clouds of the clearing\r\nsouth, striking them with a dreadful gale. Iliad xi. 305.\r\n\r\n[174] Gosselin observes that Hesiod lived about forty years after Homer,\r\nand he mentions not only the Nile, but also the Po, with which certainly\r\nHomer was unacquainted. He speaks too of the Western Ocean, where he\r\nplaces the Gorgons, and the garden of the Hesperides. It is very likely\r\nthat these various points of information were brought into Greece by the\r\nCarthaginians. The name _Nile_ seems to be merely a descriptive title;\r\nit is still in use in many countries of India, where it signifies\r\n_water_. The river known subsequently as _the Nile_, was, in Homer’s\r\ntime, called the _River of Egypt_, or the _River Egyptus_; by the latter\r\nof which titles he was acquainted with it. See Odyssey xvii. 448.\r\n\r\n[175] By this expression is intended the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[176] Gosselin remarks that the arguments made use of by Strabo are not\r\nsufficiently conclusive. The country with which the Greeks were best\r\nacquainted was Greece, undoubtedly, and it is this land which Homer has\r\ndescribed with the greatest exactness of detail.\r\n\r\n[177] An island opposite to Alexandria, and seven stadia distant\r\ntherefrom. The Ptolemies united it to the mainland by means of a pier,\r\nnamed Hepta-stadium, in allusion to its length. The sands which\r\naccumulated against the pier became the site of the present city of\r\nAlexandria. It was not on this island that the celebrated Pharos of\r\nAlexandria was erected, but on a desolate rock a little to the N.E. It\r\nreceived the same name as the island, to which it was joined by another\r\npier. As to the passage of Homer, (Odyssey iv. 354-357,) where he says\r\nthat Pharos is one day’s sail from the Egyptus, he does not mean Egypt,\r\nas Strabo fancies, but the mouth of the Nile, which river in his time\r\nwas called the Egyptus, and probably fell into the sea about one day’s\r\nsail from Pharos.\r\n\r\n[178] We have before remarked that the Ethiopia visited by Menelaus was\r\nnot the country above Egypt, generally known by that name, but an\r\nEthiopia lying round Jaffa, the ancient Joppa.\r\n\r\n[179] “The priests stated also that Menes was the first of mortals that\r\never ruled over Egypt; to this they added that in the days of that king,\r\nall Egypt, with the exception of the Thebaic nome, was but a morass; and\r\nthat none of the lands now seen below Lake Mœris, then existed; from the\r\nsea up to this place is a voyage by the river of seven days. I myself am\r\nperfectly convinced the account of the priests in this particular is\r\ncorrect; for the thing is evident to every one who sees and has common\r\nsense, although he may not have heard the fact, that the Egypt to which\r\nthe Hellenes navigate, is a land annexed to the Egyptians, and a gift\r\nfrom the river; and that even in the parts above the lake just\r\nmentioned, for three days’ sail, concerning which the priests relate\r\nnothing, the country is just of the same description.” Herod. ii. § 5.\r\n\r\n[180] The Ethiopians, who are divided into two parts, the most distant\r\nof men, some at the setting of the sun, others at the rising. Odyssey i.\r\n23.\r\n\r\n[181] Odyssey i. 23.\r\n\r\n[182] Many ancient writers entertained the opinion that the regions\r\nsurrounding the terrestrial equator were occupied by the ocean, which\r\nformed a circular zone, separating our continent from that which they\r\nsupposed to exist in the southern hemisphere. To the inhabitants of this\r\nsecond continent they gave the name of Antichthones.\r\n\r\n[183] The Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\n[184] Or nearest to the equator.\r\n\r\n[185] The isthmus of Suez.\r\n\r\n[186] Odyssey i. 23.\r\n\r\n[187] This explanation falls to the ground when we remember, that prior\r\nto the reign of Psammeticus no stranger had ever succeeded in\r\npenetrating into the interior of Egypt. This was the statement of the\r\nGreeks themselves. Now as Psammeticus did not flourish till two and a\r\nhalf centuries after Homer, that poet could not possibly have been aware\r\nof the circumstances which Strabo brings forward to justify his\r\ninterpretation of this passage which he has undertaken to defend.\r\n\r\n[188] Africa.\r\n\r\n[189] The Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[190] The Strait of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[191] The Tartessians were the inhabitants of the island of Tartessus,\r\nformed by the two arms of the Bætis, (the present Guadalquiver,) near\r\nthe mouth of this river. One of these arms being now dried up, the\r\nisland is reunited to the mainland. It forms part of the present\r\ndistrict of Andalusia. The tradition, says Gosselin, reported by\r\nEphorus, seems to me to resemble that still preserved at Tingis, a city\r\nof Mauritania, so late as the sixth century. Procopius (Vandalicor. ii.\r\n10) relates that there were two columns at Tingis bearing the following\r\ninscription in the Phœnician language, “We are they who fled before the\r\nbrigand Joshua, the son of Naue (Nun).” It does not concern us to\r\ninquire whether these columns actually existed in the time of Procopius,\r\nbut merely to remark two independent facts. The first is the tradition\r\ngenerally received for more than twenty centuries, that the coming of\r\nthe Israelites into Palestine drove one body of Canaanites, its ancient\r\ninhabitants, to the extremities of the Mediterranean, while another\r\nparty went to establish, among the savage tribes of the Peloponnesus and\r\nAttica, the earliest kingdoms known in Europe. The second observation\r\nhas reference to the name of Ethiopians given by Ephorus to this\r\nfugitive people, as confirming what we have before stated, that the\r\nenvirons of Jaffa, and possibly the entire of Palestine, anciently bore\r\nthe name of Ethiopia: and it is here we must seek for the Ethiopians of\r\nHomer, and not in the interior of Africa.\r\n\r\n[192] Africa.\r\n\r\n[193] This piece is now lost.\r\n\r\n[194] τὸ μεσημβρινὸν κλίμα.\r\n\r\n[195] Æschylus.\r\n\r\n[196] This piece is now lost.\r\n\r\n[197] Odyssey ix. 26.\r\n\r\n[198] Strabo is mistaken in interpreting πρὸς ζόφον towards the north.\r\nIt means here, as every where else, “towards the west,” and allusion in\r\nthe passage is made to Ithaca as lying west of Greece.\r\n\r\n[199] Whether they fly to the right towards the morn and the sun, or to\r\nthe left towards the darkening west. Iliad xii. 239.\r\n\r\n[200] O my friends! since we know not where is the west, nor where the\r\nmorning, nor where the sun that gives light to mortals descends beneath\r\nthe earth, nor where he rises up again. Odyssey x. 190.\r\n\r\n[201] In Book x.\r\n\r\n[202] For yesterday Jove went to Oceanus to the blameless Ethiopians, to\r\na banquet. Iliad i. 423.\r\n\r\n[203] The powerful shaker of the earth, as he was returning from the\r\nEthiopians, beheld him from a distance, from the mountains of the\r\nSolymi. Odyssey v. 282.\r\n\r\n[204] This would be true if Homer had lived two or three centuries\r\nlater, when the Greeks became acquainted with the Ethiopians on the\r\neastern and western coasts of Africa. But as the poet was only familiar\r\nwith the Mediterranean, there is no question that the Ethiopians\r\nmentioned in this passage are those of Phœnicia and Palestine.\r\n\r\n[205] Which, after they have escaped the winter and immeasurable shower,\r\nwith a clamour wing their way towards the streams of the ocean, bearing\r\nslaughter and fate to the Pygmæan men. Iliad iii. 3.\r\n\r\n[206] Gosselin is of opinion that this Iberia has no reference to Spain,\r\nbut is a country situated between the Euxine and Caspian Seas, and forms\r\npart of the present Georgia. He assigns as his reason, that if Strabo\r\nhad meant to refer to Spain, he would have mentioned it before Italy, so\r\nas not to interrupt the geographical order, which he is always careful\r\nto observe.\r\n\r\n[207] Pygmy, (πυγμαῖος,) a being whose length is a πυγμὴ, that is, from\r\nthe elbow to the hand. The Pygmæi were a fabulous nation of dwarfs, the\r\nLilliputians of antiquity, who, according to Homer, had every spring to\r\nsustain a war against the cranes on the banks of Oceanus. They were\r\nbelieved to have been descended from Pygmæus, a son of Dorus and\r\ngrandson of Epaphus. Later writers usually place them near the sources\r\nof the Nile, whither the cranes are said to have migrated every year to\r\ntake possession of the field of the Pygmies. The reports of them have\r\nbeen embellished in a variety of ways by the ancients. Hecatæus, for\r\nexample, related that they cut down every corn-ear with an axe, for they\r\nwere conceived to be an agricultural people. When Hercules came into\r\ntheir country, they climbed with ladders to the edge of his goblet to\r\ndrink from it; and when they attacked the hero, a whole army of them\r\nmade an assault upon his left hand, while two made the attack on his\r\nright. Aristotle did not believe that the accounts of the Pygmies were\r\naltogether fabulous, but thought that they were a tribe in Upper Egypt,\r\nwho had exceedingly small horses, and lived in caves. In later times we\r\nalso hear of Northern Pygmies, who lived in the neighbourhood of Thule:\r\nthey are described as very short-lived, small, and armed with spears\r\nlike needles. Lastly, we also have mention of Indian Pygmies, who lived\r\nunder the earth on the east of the river Ganges. Smith, Dict. Biog. and\r\nMythol. Various attempts have been made to account for this singular\r\nbelief, which however seems to have its only origin in the love of the\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\n[208] It must be observed that the Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea, does not\r\nrun parallel to the equator, consequently it could not form any\r\nconsiderable part of a meridian circle; thus Strabo is wrong even as to\r\nthe physical position of the Gulf, but this is not much to be wondered\r\nat, as he supposed an equatorial division of the earth into two\r\nhemispheres by the ocean.\r\n\r\n[209] 15,000 of the stadia employed by Strabo were equivalent to 21° 25’\r\n43”. The distance from the Isthmus of Suez to the Strait of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb, following our better charts, is 20° 15’. Strabo says\r\nnearly 15,000 stadia; and this length may be considered just equal to\r\nthat of the Arabian Gulf. Its breadth, so far as we know, is in some\r\nplaces equal to 1800 stadia.\r\n\r\n[210] The Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[211] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[212] Aristotle accounts for Homer’s mentioning Thebes rather than\r\nMemphis, by saying that, at the time of the poet, the formation of that\r\npart of Egypt by alluvial deposit was very recent. So that Memphis\r\neither did not then exist, or at all events had not then obtained its\r\nafter celebrity. Aristotle likewise seems to say that anciently Egypt\r\nconsisted only of the territory of the Thebaid, καὶ τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἡ\r\nΑἴγυπτος, Θῆβαι καλούμεναι.\r\n\r\n[213] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[214] Gosselin says, “Read 4000, as in lib. xvii. This correction is\r\nindicated by the following measure given by Herodotus:\r\n\r\n   From the sea to Heliopolis           1500 stadia\r\n   From Heliopolis to Thebes            4860\r\n                                        ————\r\n                                        6360\r\n\r\nThe stadium made use of in Egypt at the time of Herodotus consisted of\r\n1111-1/9 to a degree on the grand circle, as may be seen by comparing\r\nthe measure of the coasts of the Delta furnished by that historian with\r\nour actual information. The length of this stadium may likewise be\r\nascertained by reference to Aristotle. In the time of Eratosthenes and\r\nStrabo, the stadium of 700 to a degree was employed in Egypt. Now 6360\r\nstadia of 1111-1/9 to a degree make just 4006 stadia of 700:\r\nconsequently these two measures are identical, their apparent\r\ninconsistency merely resulting from the different scales by which\r\npreceding authors had expressed them.” This reasoning seems very\r\nplausible, but we must remark that Col. Leake, in a valuable paper “On\r\nthe Stade as a Linear Measure,” published in vol. ix. of the Journal of\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society, is of opinion that Gosselin’s system of\r\nstadia of different lengths cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\n[215] Namely Crates and Aristarchus. The last was of Alexandria, and\r\nconsequently an Egyptian. Crates was of Cilicia, which was regarded as a\r\npart of Syria.\r\n\r\n[216] This is a very favourite axiom with Strabo, notwithstanding he too\r\noften forgets it himself.\r\n\r\n[217] The Phrygians were considered to be more timid than any other\r\npeople, and consequently the hares of their country more timid than\r\nthose of any other. We see then a two-fold hyperbole in the expression\r\nthat a man is more timid than a Phrygian hare.\r\n\r\n[218] Alcæus of Mitylene in the island of Lesbos, the earliest of the\r\nÆolian lyric poets, began to flourish in the forty-second Olympiad (B.\r\nC. 610). In the second year of this Olympiad we find Cicis and\r\nAntimenidas, the brothers of Alcæus, fighting under Pittacus against\r\nMelanchrus, who is described as the tyrant of Lesbos, and who fell in\r\nthe conflict. Alcæus does not appear to have taken part with his\r\nbrothers on this occasion; on the contrary, he speaks of Melanchrus in\r\nterms of high praise. Alcæus is mentioned in connexion with the war in\r\nTroas, between the Athenians and Mitylenæans, for the possession of\r\nSigæum. During the period which followed this war, the contest between\r\nthe nobles and the people of Mitylene was brought to a crisis. The party\r\nof Alcæus engaged actively on the side of the nobles, and was defeated.\r\nWhen he and his brother Antimenidas perceived that all hope of their\r\nrestoration to Mitylene was gone, they travelled over different\r\ncountries. Alcæus visited Egypt, and appears to have written poems in\r\nwhich his adventures by sea were described. Horace, Carm. ii. 13. 26.\r\nSee Smith’s Dict. of Biog. and Mythol.\r\n\r\n[219] But in it there is a haven with good mooring, from whence they\r\ntake equal ships into the sea, having drawn black water. Odyssey iv.\r\n358.\r\n\r\n[220] Certainly having suffered many things, and having wandered much, I\r\nwas brought in my ships, and I returned in the eighth year; having\r\nwandered to Cyprus, and Phœnice, and the Egyptians, I came to the\r\nEthiopians and Sidonians, and Erembians, and Libya. Odyssey iv. 81.\r\n\r\n[221] On the coasts of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[222] Strabo intends to say that the ships of Menelaus were not\r\nconstructed so as to be capable of being taken to pieces, and carried on\r\nthe backs of the sailors, as those of the Ethiopians were.\r\n\r\n[223] Having mentioned the Phœnicians, amongst whom the Sidonians are\r\ncomprised, he certainly would not have enumerated these latter as a\r\nseparate people.\r\n\r\n[224] That is to say, that he made the entire circuit of Africa,\r\nstarting from Cadiz, and doubling the Cape of Good Hope. Such was the\r\nopinion of Crates, who endeavoured to explain all the expressions of\r\nHomer after mathematical hypotheses. If any one were to inquire how\r\nMenelaus, who was wandering about the Mediterranean, could have come\r\ninto Ethiopia, Crates would answer, that Menelaus left the Mediterranean\r\nand entered the Atlantic, whence he could easily travel by sea into\r\nEthiopia. In this he merely followed the hypothesis of the\r\nmathematicians, who said that the inhabited earth in all its southern\r\nportion was traversed by the Atlantic Ocean, and the other seas\r\ncontiguous thereto.\r\n\r\n[225] The Isthmus of Suez. This isthmus they supposed to be covered by\r\nthe sea, as Strabo explains further on.\r\n\r\n[226] Thus far he, collecting much property and gold, wandered with his\r\nships. Odyssey iii. 301.\r\n\r\n[227] Odyssey iv. 83.\r\n\r\n[228] Strabo here appears to have followed Aristotle, who attributes to\r\nSesostris the construction of the first canal connecting the\r\nMediterranean, or rather the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, with the Red\r\nSea. Pliny has followed the same tradition. Strabo, Book xvii., informs\r\nus, that other authors attribute the canal to Necho the son of\r\nPsammeticus; and this is the opinion of Herodotus and Diodorus. It is\r\npossible these authors may be speaking of two different attempts to cut\r\nthis canal. Sesostris flourished about 1356 years before Christ, Necho\r\n615 years before the same era. About a century after Necho, Darius the\r\nson of Hystaspes made the undertaking, but desisted under the false\r\nimpression that the level of the Red Sea was higher than that of the\r\nMediterranean. Ptolemy Philadelphus proved this to be an error, by\r\nuniting the Red Sea to the Nile without causing any inundation. At the\r\ntime of Trajan and Hadrian the communication was still in existence,\r\nthough subsequently it became choked up by an accumulation of sand. It\r\nwill be remembered that a recent proposition for opening the canal was\r\nopposed in Egypt on similar grounds.\r\n\r\n[229] Mount El Kas.\r\n\r\n[230] Tineh.\r\n\r\n[231] But the immortals will send you to the Elysian plain, and the\r\nboundaries of the earth.

A much larger\r\nterritory was anciently comprehended under this designation, containing\r\nthe whole of Hedjaz, and even Nedjed-el-Ared.

A description of this place will be found in the 17th\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[241] At this port it was that Agesilaus terminated his glorious career.\r\n\r\n[242] Iliad xiii. 1.

Odyssey\r\nxii. 437.\r\n\r\n[277] Gaudus, the little island of Gozo near Malta, supposed by\r\nCallimachus to have been the Isle of Calypso.\r\n\r\n[278] It seems more probable that Callimachus intended the island of\r\nCorsura, now Pantalaria, a small island between Africa and Sicily.\r\n\r\n[279] The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[280] A river of Colchis, _hodie_ Fasz or Rion.\r\n\r\n[281] Cybele, so named because she had a temple on Mount Ida.\r\n\r\n[282] An island in the Ægæan, now Meteline.\r\n\r\n[283] _Hodie_ Lemno or Stalimene.\r\n\r\n[284] Euneos was the eldest of the children which Hypsipyle, daughter of\r\nThoas, king of Lemnos, had by Jason during his stay in that island.\r\n\r\n[285] A town situated at the bottom of the Pelasgic Gulf, _hodie_ Volo.\r\n\r\n[286] A country of Thessaly, which received its designation of Achæan,\r\nfrom the same sovereign who left his name to Achaia in Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n[287] Eumelus, whom Alcestis, divine amongst women, most beautiful in\r\nform of the daughters of Pelias, brought forth to Admetus. Iliad ii.\r\n714.\r\n\r\n[288] Named Ideessa in the time of Strabo. Strabo, book xi. c. ii. § 18.\r\n\r\n[289] Sinop.\r\n\r\n[290] Candia.\r\n\r\n[291] _Hodie_ The Isle of Nanfio.\r\n\r\n[292] Now the Island of Callistè, founded by Theras the Lacedæmonian\r\nmore than ten centuries before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[293] A name of Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[294] The Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n[295] The erroneous opinion that one of the mouths of the Danube emptied\r\nitself into the Adriatic is very ancient, being spoken of by Aristotle\r\nas a well-known fact, and likewise supported by Theopompus, Hipparchus,\r\nand many other writers.\r\n\r\n[296] Odyssey x. 137.\r\n\r\n[297] Odyssey xii. 70.\r\n\r\n[298] Antiphanes of Berga, a city of Thrace. This writer was so noted\r\nfor his falsehoods, that βεργαίζειν came to be a proverbial term for\r\ndesignating that vice.\r\n\r\n[299] Thirty years before the time of this Damastes, Herodotus had\r\ndemonstrated to the Greeks the real nature of the Arabian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[300] This river, called by the Turks Karasu, rises somewhere in Mount\r\nTaurus, and before emptying itself into the sea, runs through Tarsus.\r\n\r\n[301] The Ab-Zal of oriental writers.\r\n\r\n[302] The ancient capital of the kings of Persia, now Schuss.\r\n\r\n[303] The very idea that Diotimus could sail from the Cydnus into the\r\nEuphrates is most absurd, since, besides the distance between the two\r\nrivers, they are separated by lofty mountain-ridges.\r\n\r\n[304] Now the Bay of Ajazzo.\r\n\r\n[305] Iskouriah.\r\n\r\n[306] Gosselin justly remarks that this is a mere disputing about terms,\r\nsince, though it is true the Mediterranean and Euxine flow into each\r\nother, it is fully admissible to describe them as separate. The same\r\nauthority proves that we ought to read 3600 and not 3000 stadia, which\r\nhe supposes to be a transcriber’s error.\r\n\r\n[307] Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\n[308] Castor and Pollux were amongst the number of the Argonauts. On\r\ntheir return they destroyed the pirates who infested the seas of Greece\r\nand the Archipelago, and were in consequence worshipped by sailors as\r\ntutelary deities.\r\n\r\n[309] The Phœnicians or Carthaginians despatched Hanno to found certain\r\ncolonies on the western coast of Africa, about a thousand years before\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\n[310] Strabo here follows the general belief that Æneas escaped to Italy\r\nafter the sack of Troy, a fact clearly disproved by Homer, Iliad xx.\r\n307, who states that the posterity of Æneas were in his time reigning at\r\nTroy. To this passage Strabo alludes in his 13th book, and, contrary to\r\nhis general custom, hesitates whether to follow Homer’s authority or\r\nthat of certain grammarians who had mutilated the passage in order to\r\nflatter the vanity of the Romans, who took pride in looking up to Æneas\r\nand the Trojans as their ancestors.\r\n\r\n[311] Antenor having betrayed his Trojan countrymen was forced to fly.\r\nIt is generally stated that, taking with him a party of the Heneti, (a\r\npeople of Asia Minor close to the Euxine,) who had come to the\r\nassistance of Priam, he founded the city of Padua in Italy. From this\r\npeople the district in which Padua is situated received the name of\r\nHenetia, afterwards Venetia or Venice.\r\n\r\n[312] The coasts of Italy.\r\n\r\n[313] It is generally admitted that the events of the Trojan war gave\r\nrise to numerous colonies.\r\n\r\n[314] The word λιμνοθάλασσα frequently signifies a salt marsh. The\r\nFrench editors remark that it was a name given by the Greeks to lagoons\r\nmostly found in the vicinity of the sea, though entirely separated\r\ntherefrom. Those which communicated with the sea were termed\r\nστομαλίμναι.\r\n\r\n[315] See book xvii. c. iii.\r\n\r\n[316] A country close upon the Euxine.\r\n\r\n[317] The Strait of the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[318] At the time of Diodorus Siculus, the people of the Isle of\r\nSamothracia preserved the tradition of an inundation caused by a sudden\r\nrising of the waters of the Mediterranean, which compelled the\r\ninhabitants to fly for refuge to the summits of the mountains; and long\r\nafter, the fishermen’s nets used to be caught by columns, which, prior\r\nto the catastrophe, had adorned their edifices. It is said that the\r\ninundation originated in a rupture of the chain of mountains which\r\nenclosed the valley which has since become the Thracian Bosphorus or\r\nStrait of Constantinople, through which the waters of the Black Sea flow\r\ninto the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[319] Now Midjeh, in Roumelia, on the borders of the Black Sea. Strabo\r\nalludes rather to the banks surrounding Salmydessus than to the town\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[320] The part of Bulgaria next the sea, between Varna and the Danube,\r\nnow Dobrudzie.\r\n\r\n[321] Tineh.\r\n\r\n[322] El-Kas.\r\n\r\n[323] Lake Sebaket-Bardoil.\r\n\r\n[324] Probably the present Maseli. Most likely the place was so named\r\nfrom the γέῤῥα, or wattled huts, of the troops stationed there to\r\nprevent the ingress of foreign armies into Egypt.\r\n\r\n[325] This city of Calpe was near Mount Calpe, one of the Pillars of\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\n[326] Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[327] The Ægæan.\r\n\r\n[328] Danube.\r\n\r\n[329] Mingrelia.\r\n\r\n[330] The river Fasz.\r\n\r\n[331] Now Djanik.\r\n\r\n[332] The river Thermeh.\r\n\r\n[333] The Jekil-Irmak.\r\n\r\n[334] Sidin, or Valisa, is comprised in the territory of Djanik, being\r\npart of the ancient kingdom of Pontus.\r\n\r\n[335] The river Geihun.\r\n\r\n[336] Gosselin remarks that the alluvial deposit of this river is now no\r\nnearer to Cyprus than it was at the time of the prediction.\r\n\r\n[337] Cilicia and Cataonia are comprised in the modern Aladeuli.\r\n\r\n[338] Iliad ix. 7.\r\n\r\n[339] Being swollen it rises high around the projecting points, and\r\nspits from it the foam of the sea. Iliad iv. 425.\r\n\r\n[340] The lofty shores resound, the wave being ejected [upon the beach].\r\nIliad xvii. 265.\r\n\r\n[341] The word ὄργυια, here rendered fathoms, strictly means the length\r\nof the outstretched arms. As a measure of length it equals four πήχεις,\r\nor six feet one inch. Gosselin seems to doubt with reason whether they\r\never sounded such a depth as this would give, and proposes to compute it\r\nby a smaller stadium in use at the time of Herodotus, which would have\r\nthe effect of diminishing the depth by almost one half.\r\n\r\n[342] A city of Achaia near to the Gulf of Corinth. Pliny tells us it\r\nwas submerged during an earthquake, about 371 years before the Christian\r\nera. According to Pausanias, it was a second time destroyed by the shock\r\nof an earthquake, but again rebuilt by the inhabitants who survived.\r\n\r\n[343] A city placed by some in Thrace, but by others in Pontus; a more\r\nprobable opinion seems to be that Bizone was in Lower Mœsia, on the\r\nwestern side of the Euxine. Pomponius Mela asserts that Bizone was\r\nentirely destroyed by an earthquake, but according to Strabo, (lib.\r\nvii.,) who places it about 40 stadia from the sea, it was only partially\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n[344] Ischia.\r\n\r\n[345] We have here followed the earlier editions, as preferable to\r\nKramer, who supplies μὴ before μαθηματικὸς.\r\n\r\n[346] Demetrius Poliorcetes: the same intention is narrated by Pliny and\r\nother historians of Julius Cæsar, Caligula, and Nero.\r\n\r\n[347] Kankri.\r\n\r\n[348] Strait of Messina.\r\n\r\n[349] The sea which washes the shores of Tuscany. Strabo applies the\r\nterm to the whole sea from the mouth of the Arno to Sicily.\r\n\r\n[350] Strait of Messina.\r\n\r\n[351] Gosselin observes that Le Père Babin, who had carefully examined\r\nthe currents of the Euripus of Chalcis, says that they are regular\r\nduring eighteen or nineteen days of every month, the flux and reflux\r\noccurring twice in the twenty-four hours, and following the same laws as\r\nin the ocean; but from the ninth to the thirteenth, and from the\r\ntwenty-first to the twenty-sixth, of each lunar month they become\r\nirregular, the flux occurring from twelve to fourteen times in the\r\ntwenty-four hours, and the reflux as often.\r\n\r\n[352] See Plutarch, de Plac. Philos. lib. i. c. 14, and Stobæus, Ecl.\r\nPhys. lib. i. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[353] El-Kas.\r\n\r\n[354] The Arabian Gulf. Mr. Stephenson, while examining the Temsah\r\nLakes, anciently called the Bitter Lakes, discovered recent marine\r\nremains similar to those on the shores of the present sea, clearly\r\nshowing that the basin of the Temsah Lakes was the head of the Arabian\r\nGulf at a period geologically recent.\r\n\r\n[355] We have here followed MSS. which all read συνελθούσης δὲ τῆς\r\nθαλάττης. The French editors propose συνενδούσης δὲ τῆς θαλάττης, with\r\nthe sense of “but on the retiring of the Mediterranean,” &c.\r\n\r\n[356] This accusation may not seem quite fair to the English reader.\r\n_Touch_ is the nearest term in our language by which we can express the\r\nGreek συνάπτω, the use of which Strabo objects to in this passage; still\r\nthe meaning of the English word is much too definite for the Greek.\r\n\r\n[357] The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[358] Viz. the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[359] The western part of the town of Corinth, situated in the sea of\r\nCrissa. Its modern name is Pelagio.\r\n\r\n[360] Kankri.\r\n\r\n[361] Viz. the temple of Jupiter Ammon, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[362] Gosselin remarks, Cyrene was founded 631 years before the\r\nChristian era, and at that time the limits of the Mediterranean were the\r\nsame as they are now. Amongst the Greeks, dolphins were the ordinary\r\nsymbols of the principal sea-port towns; and if the delegates from Cyrene\r\nset up this symbol of their country in the temple of Ammon, I see no\r\nreason why Eratosthenes and Strabo should regard the offering as a proof\r\nthat the temple was on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[363] We have thought it necessary, with the French translators, to\r\ninsert these words, since although they are found in no MS. of Strabo,\r\nthe argument which follows is clearly unintelligible without them.\r\n\r\n[364] Hipparchus, believing that the Danube emptied itself by one mouth\r\ninto the Euxine, and by another into the Adriatic Gulf, imagined that if\r\nthe waters of the Mediterranean were raised in the manner proposed by\r\nEratosthenes, the valley through which that river flows would have been\r\nsubmerged, and so formed a kind of strait by which the Euxine would have\r\nbeen connected to the Adriatic Gulf.\r\n\r\n[365] The Lipari Islands.\r\n\r\n[366] There is some mistake here. Strabo himself elsewhere tells us that\r\nthe islands of Thera and Therasia were situated in the Ægæan Sea, near\r\nto the island of Nanfio.\r\n\r\n[367] “Defending from danger.” More probably, in this instance, the\r\nSecurer of Foundations.\r\n\r\n[368] Egripo.\r\n\r\n[369] This plain was near the city of Chalcis, which at the present day\r\nbears the same name as the island itself.\r\n\r\n[370] And reached the two fair-flowing springs, where the two springs of\r\nthe eddying Scamander rise. The one, indeed, flows with tepid water, and\r\na steam arises from it around, as of burning fire; whilst the other\r\nflows forth in the summer time, like unto hail, or cold snow, or ice\r\nfrom water. Iliad xxii. 147.\r\n\r\n[371] Tantalus lived about 1387, B. C.\r\n\r\n[372] Lydia and Ionia form the modern provinces of Aidin and Sarukan in\r\nAnadoli. A part of the Troad still preserves the name of Troiaki.\r\n\r\n[373] A mountain in Mæonia, close to the city of Magnesia.\r\n\r\n[374] Ilus, who ascended the throne about 1400 years before the\r\nChristian era, founded the city, to which he gave the name of Ilium. The\r\nold city of Troy stood on a hill, and was safe from the inundation.\r\n\r\n[375] These two cities were built on little islets adjoining the\r\ncontinent. Alexander connected them with the mainland by means of\r\njetties. Clazomenæ was situated on the Gulf of Smyrna, near to a place\r\nnow called Vurla or Burla. The present appellation of Tyre, on the coast\r\nof Phœnicia, is Sur.\r\n\r\n[376] Tineh.\r\n\r\n[377] El-Kas.\r\n\r\n[378] Of Suez.\r\n\r\n[379] That part of the Mediterranean adjoining Egypt.\r\n\r\n[380] The Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[381] The Red Sea and Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[382] Sta. Maura.\r\n\r\n[383] Odyss. xxiv. 376.\r\n\r\n[384] The island of Ortygia, now St. Marcian.\r\n\r\n[385] Diakopton.\r\n\r\n[386] Probably Bulika, according to others Trypia or Niora.\r\n\r\n[387] Methone is the same town which Pausanias (l. ii. c. 32) names\r\nMethona, it was situated in the Argolis between Trœzene and Epidaurus.\r\nThe above writer tells us that in the reign of Antigonus, son of\r\nDemetrius king of Macedonia, there was a breaking out of subterranean\r\nfires close to Methona. This event, which it is probable Strabo alludes\r\nto, occurred some where between the years 277 and 244, before the\r\nChristian era. The town still exists under its ancient name of Methona.\r\n\r\n[388] An error in all the MSS. The Saronic Gulf is intended.\r\n\r\n[389] Vide Strabo, b. ix. c. ii. § 34, 35.\r\n\r\n[390] In Bœotia.\r\n\r\n[391] The Second Iliad, or Catalogue of Ships.\r\n\r\n[392] And those who inhabited grape-clustered Arne, and those [who\r\ninhabited] Mideia. Iliad ii. 507.\r\n\r\n[393] This Thracian lake or lagoon is now called Burum. It is formed by\r\nthe mouths of several rivers, and lies to the north of the isle of\r\nThaso.\r\n\r\n[394] Diaskillo, _al._ Biga.\r\n\r\n[395] These are certain little islands at the mouth of the river\r\nAchelous, the modern Aspro-potamo, which formed the boundary between\r\nAcarnania and Ætolia. Now Curzolari.\r\n\r\n[396] It is supposed we should here read Herodotus. Conf. Herod. ii. 10.\r\n\r\n[397] Daskalio.\r\n\r\n[398] Now there is a certain rocky island in the middle of the sea,\r\nbetween Ithaca and the rugged Samos, Asteris, not large; and in it there\r\nare havens fit for ships, with two entrances. Odyssey iv. 844.\r\n\r\n[399] That is to say, the territory opposite Issa; probably the ruins\r\nnear to Kalas Limenaias.\r\n\r\n[400] The present island of Metelino.\r\n\r\n[401] Ἡ δὲ Ἄντισσα νῆσος ἦν πρότερον, ὡς Μυρσίλος φησί· τῆς [δὲ] Λέσβου\r\nκαλουμένης πρότερον Ἴσσης, καὶ τὴν νῆσον Ἄντισσαν καλεῖσθαι συνέβη. Our\r\nrendering of this passage, though rather free, seemed necessary to the\r\nclear explication of the Greek.\r\n\r\n[402] Procita.\r\n\r\n[403] Ischia.\r\n\r\n[404] Miseno, the northern cape of the Gulf of Naples.\r\n\r\n[405] Capri.\r\n\r\n[406] Reggio.\r\n\r\n[407] These two mountains are separated from each other by the river\r\nPenæus.\r\n\r\n[408] Ῥαγάς, _a rent or chink_. This town was sixty miles from Ecbatana;\r\nit was named by the Arabs Raï, and is now in ruins. It is the Rhages in\r\nTobias.\r\n\r\n[409] Certain mountain defiles, now called Firouz-Koh.\r\n\r\n[410] A western promontory of Eubœa, called by the modern Greeks Kabo\r\nLithari. The Lichadian Islands, which now bear the name of Litada, are\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\n[411] A city of Eubœa; _hod._ Dipso.\r\n\r\n[412] In Eubœa, now Orio.\r\n\r\n[413] Now Echino; belonged to Thessaly and was near the sea.\r\n\r\n[414] Now Stillida; situated on the Bay of Zeitun.\r\n\r\n[415] A little town situated in a plain amongst the mountains. It\r\nreceived its name from a tradition that Hercules abode there during the\r\ntime that the pyre on Mount Œta was being prepared, into which he cast\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[416] Lamia in Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[417] A city of the Epi-Cnemidian Locrians in Achaia; its present name\r\nis Bondoniza.\r\n\r\n[418] A town close to Scarpheia; its ruins are said to be still visible\r\nat Palaio Kastro.\r\n\r\n[419] Now Agriomela or Ellada, a river descending from Mount Œta, and\r\nemptying itself into the Bay of Zeitun.\r\n\r\n[420] A torrent near Thronium; its present name is Boagrio.\r\n\r\n[421] Three cities of the Opuntian Locrians; Cynus, the port of Opus, is\r\nnow called Kyno.\r\n\r\n[422] One of the principal cities of Phocis, near the river Cephissus; a\r\nlittle village called Leuta stands on the ancient site.\r\n\r\n[423] Probably the Alpene in Locris mentioned by Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[424] The modern Talanta.\r\n\r\n[425] Egripo.\r\n\r\n[426] The Western Iberians are the people who inhabited Spain, and were\r\nsaid to have removed into Eastern Iberia, a country situated in the\r\ncentre of the isthmus which separates the Euxine from the Caspian Sea.\r\nThe district is now called Carduel, and is a region of Georgia.\r\n\r\n[427] The river Aras.\r\n\r\n[428] The river Kur.\r\n\r\n[429] The mountains which border Colchis or Mingrelia on the south.\r\n\r\n[430] According to Herodotus, Sesostris was the only Egyptian monarch\r\nwho ever reigned in Ethiopia. Pliny says he penetrated as far as the\r\npromontory of Mosylon.\r\n\r\n[431] Veneti.\r\n\r\n[432] A small people of Thessaly, who latterly dwelt near Mount Œta,\r\nwhich separated them from Ætolia and Phocis.\r\n\r\n[433] A city and plain in Thessaly, near to Mount Ossa.\r\n\r\n[434] A people of Macedon, at the time of Strabo dwelling north of the\r\nriver Peneius.\r\n\r\n[435] Few nations have wandered so far and wide as the Galatæ. We meet\r\nwith them in Europe, Asia, and Africa, under the various names of\r\nGalatæ, Galatians, Gauls, and Kelts. Galatia, in Asia Minor, was settled\r\nby one of these hordes.\r\n\r\n[436] There were many kings of Phrygia of this name.\r\n\r\n[437] The text of Kramer follows most MSS. in reading “Kimmerians,” but\r\nhe points it out as a manifest error; and refers to Herodotus i. 103.\r\n\r\n[438] By Hyperboreans are meant people who dwelt beyond the point from\r\nwhence the north wind proceeded: Hypernotii therefore should be those\r\nwho lived beyond the point of the procession of the south wind. The\r\nremark of Herodotus will be found, lib. iv. § 36. It is simply this:\r\nSupposing Hyperboreans, there ought likewise to be Hypernotii.\r\n\r\n[439] Those who exult over the misfortunes of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n[440] Those who rejoice in others’ prosperity.\r\n\r\n[441] Gosselin observes, that what Strabo here says, is in accordance\r\nwith the geographical system of the ancients, who supposed that Africa\r\ndid not extend as far as the equator. As they distinguished the\r\ncontinent situated in the northern from a continent which they believed\r\nto exist in the southern hemisphere, and which they styled the\r\nAntichthones, they called the wind, blowing from the neighbourhood of\r\nthe equator, in the direction of the two poles, a south wind for either\r\nhemisphere. For example, if sailors should be brought to the equator by\r\na north wind, and that same wind should continue to waft them on their\r\ncourse after having passed the line, it would no longer be called a\r\nnorth, but a south wind.\r\n\r\n[442] According to Gosselin, this does not allude to the size of the\r\nwhole earth, but merely that part of it which, according to the theory\r\nof the ancients, was alone habitable.\r\n\r\n[443] Most probably Gherri in Sennaar.\r\n\r\n[444] Eratosthenes supposed that Meroe, Alexandria, the Hellespont, and\r\nthe mouth of the Borysthenes or Dnieper, were all under the same\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\n[445] The Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[446] Iceland.\r\n\r\n[447] This Island of the Egyptians is the same which Strabo elsewhere\r\ncalls the Island of the Exiles, because it was inhabited by Egyptians\r\nwho had revolted from Psammeticus, and established themselves in the\r\nisland. Its exact situation is unknown.\r\n\r\n[448] Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[449] Ireland.\r\n\r\n[450] France.\r\n\r\n[451] Between the Rhine and Elbe.\r\n\r\n[452] The latitudes of Marseilles and Constantinople differ by 2° 16’\r\n21”. Gosselin enters into a lengthened explanation on this subject, i.\r\n158.\r\n\r\n[453] Ireland.\r\n\r\n[454] The eastern mouth of the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[455] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[456] In the opinion of Strabo and Eratosthenes, the narrowest portion\r\nof India was measured by a line running direct from the eastern\r\nembouchure of the Ganges to the sources of the Indus, that is, the\r\nnorthern side of India bounded by the great chain of the Taurus.\r\n\r\n[457] Cape Comorin is the farthest point on the eastern coast.

Eratosthenes and\r\nHipparchus were out but 14’ and some seconds in their calculation of the\r\nlatitude of Marseilles; but Strabo’s error touching the same amounted to\r\n3° 43’ 28”; he consequently fixed the northern coasts of France at 45°\r\n17’ 18”, which is about the latitude of the mouth of the Garonne.\r\n\r\n[501] These 8800 stadia, at 700 to a degree, amount to 12° 34’ 17” of\r\nlatitude.

We have omitted the latter\r\nword altogether from the translation, as being a slip of the pen. Strabo\r\ncertainly never supposed the Cinnamon Country to be any where in India.\r\n\r\n[525] Ireland.\r\n\r\n[526] Perhaps it may aid the reader in realizing these different\r\nreasonings if we give a summary of them in figures.\r\n\r\n   Strabo supposes that Hipparchus, reckoning from the\r\n   equator to the limits of the inhabited earth,            8,800 stadia\r\n\r\n   should have fixed the southern extremity of India more\r\n   to the north by                                          4,000\r\n\r\n   and the northern extremity of India, according to the\r\n   measures of Deimachus, still more to the north by       30,000\r\n                                                           ——————\r\n                                                     Total 42,800\r\n\r\n   Now, Strabo adds, following Hipparchus, the northern\r\n   shores of Keltica and the mouth of the Dnieper, are\r\n   distant from the equator                                34,000\r\n\r\n   Ierne, in a climate almost uninhabitable, was, according\r\n   to Strabo’s own impression, situated to the north\r\n   of Keltica                                               5,000\r\n                                                            —————\r\n                                                           39,000\r\n   Then, according to Hipparchus, the habitable latitudes\r\n   would extend still farther than Ierne by                 3,800\r\n                                                            —————\r\n                                                     Total 42,800\r\n\r\nThe great fertility of Bactriana, according to Strabo, appeared to be\r\ninconsistent with a position so far towards the north. In this he was\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n[527] These 4000 stadia do not accord with the distances elsewhere\r\npropounded by Strabo. Possibly he had before him various charts\r\nconstructed on different hypotheses, and made his computations not\r\nalways from the same.\r\n\r\n[528] Viz. 3800.\r\n\r\n[529] Ireland.\r\n\r\n[530] France.\r\n\r\n[531] The astronomical cubit of the ancients equalled 2 degrees. It\r\ntherefore follows that in the regions alluded to by Hipparchus, the sun\r\nat the winter solstice rose no higher than 18 degrees above the horizon.\r\nThis would give a latitude of a little above 48 degrees. We afterwards\r\nfind that Hipparchus placed the mouth of the Dnieper, and that part of\r\nFrance here alluded to, under 48° 29’ 19”, and we know that at this\r\nlatitude, which is only 20’ 56” different from that of Paris, there is\r\nno real night during the longest days of the summer.\r\n\r\n[532] Read 7700.\r\n\r\n[533] Lit., during the winter days, but the winter solstice is evidently\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n[534] Read about 10,500. This correction is borne out by the\r\nastronomical indications added by Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[535] Strabo supposed the latitude of Ireland to be 52° 25’ 42”.\r\nCountries north of this he considered to be altogether uninhabitable on\r\naccount of their inclemency.\r\n\r\n[536] Equinoctial hours.\r\n\r\n[537] Read 10,500, as above.\r\n\r\n[538] Ireland.\r\n\r\n[539] The equinoctial line.\r\n\r\n[540] There is no doubt that the expressions which Deimachus appears to\r\nhave used were correct. It seems that he wished to show that beyond the\r\nIndus the coasts of India, instead of running in a direction almost due\r\neast, as the Greeks imagined they did, sloped in a direction between the\r\nsouth and the north-east, which is correct enough. As Deimachus had\r\nresided at Palibothra, he had had an opportunity of obtaining more exact\r\ninformation relative to the form of India than that which was current at\r\nAlexandria. This seems the more certain, as Megasthenes, who had also\r\nlived at Palibothra, stated that by measuring India from the Caucasus to\r\nthe southern extremity of the continent, you would obtain, not its\r\nlength, as the Greeks imagined, but its breadth. These correct accounts\r\nwere obstinately rejected by the speculative geographers of Alexandria,\r\nbecause they imagined a certain uninhabitable zone, into which India\r\nought not to penetrate.\r\n\r\n[541] The truth of these facts depends on the locality where the\r\nobservations are made. In the time of Alexander the most southern of the\r\nseven principal stars which compose the Greater Bear had a declination\r\nof about 61 degrees, so that for all latitudes above 29 degrees, the\r\nWain never set. Consequently if Deimachus were speaking of the aspect of\r\nthe heavens as seen from the northern provinces of India, the Punjaub\r\nfor instance, there was truth in his assertion, that the two Bears were\r\nnever seen to set there, nor the shadows to fall in contrary directions.\r\nOn the other hand, as Megasthenes appears to be speaking of the south of\r\nIndia, that is, of the peninsula situated entirely south of the tropic,\r\nit is certain that he was right in saying that the shadows cast by the\r\nsun fell sometimes towards the north, at others towards the south, and\r\nthat accordingly, as we proceeded towards the south, the Bears would be\r\nseen to set. The whole of Ursa Major at that time set at 29 degrees, and\r\nour present polar star at 13 degrees. β of the Lesser Bear was at that\r\ntime the most northern of the seven principal stars of that\r\nconstellation, and set at 8° 45’. So that both Bears entirely\r\ndisappeared beneath the horizon of Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\n[542] This would be at Syene under the tropic.\r\n\r\n[543] Small zones parallel to the equator; they were placed at such a\r\ndistance from each other, that there might be half an hour’s difference\r\nbetween each on the longest day of summer. So by taking an observation\r\non the longest day, you could determine the _clima_ and consequently the\r\nposition of a place. This was equivalent to observing the elevation of\r\nthe pole. At the end of this second book Strabo enters into a long\r\ndescription of the _climata_.\r\n\r\n[544] This observation, taken at the time of Hipparchus, would indicate\r\na latitude of 16° 48’ 34.”\r\n\r\n[545] Nearchus in speaking of the southern extremity of India, near Cape\r\nComorin, was correct in the assertion that in his time the two Bears\r\nwere there seen to set.\r\n\r\n[546] Hipparchus fixed the latitude of Meroe at 16° 51’ 25”, and the\r\nextremity of India at 18°. In the time of Alexander, the Lesser Bear was\r\nnot observed to set for either of these latitudes. Strabo therefore drew\r\nthe conclusion, that if Hipparchus had adopted the opinion of Nearchus,\r\nhe would have fixed the extremity of India south of Meroe, instead of\r\nnorth of that city.\r\n\r\n[547] Now ruins, near Jerobolos, or Jerabees, the ancient Europus; not\r\nDecr or Deir.\r\n\r\n[548] Probably the present Barena, a branch of the Taurus.\r\n\r\n[549] This is rather free, but the text could not well otherwise be\r\nrendered intelligibly.\r\n\r\n[550] σφραγίδας is the Greek word; for which _section_ is a poor\r\nequivalent, but the best we believe the language affords.\r\n\r\n[551] The name of a considerable portion of Asia.\r\n\r\n[552] From Eratosthenes’ description of India, preserved by our author\r\nin his 15th book, we gather that he conceived the country to be\r\nsomething in the form of an irregular quadrilateral, having one right,\r\ntwo obtuse, and one acute angle, consequently none of its sides parallel\r\nto each other.

Between the Euphrates and the Tigris lay\r\nMesopotamia, and beyond the Tigris, Assyria. The whole of these\r\ncountries formerly bore the name of Syria. The Hebrews denominated\r\nMesopotamia, Syria of the Rivers. The name Assyria seems to be nothing\r\nmore than Syria with the article prefixed.

The\r\nlongitude of the two cities differs by 2° 22’ 45”.\r\n\r\n[590] Due east.\r\n\r\n[591] The following is a _Resumé_ of the argument of Hipparchus, “The\r\nhypotenuse of the supposed triangle, or the line drawn from Babylon to\r\nthe Caspian Gates being only 6700 stadia, would be necessarily shorter\r\nthan either of the other sides, since the line from Babylon to the\r\nfrontiers of Carmania is estimated by Eratosthenes at 9170, and that\r\nfrom the frontiers of Carmania to the Caspian Gates above 9000 stadia.\r\nThe frontiers of Carmania would thus be east of the Caspian Gates, and\r\nPersia would consequently be comprised, not in the third, but in the\r\nsecond section of Eratosthenes, being east of the meridian of the\r\nCaspian Gates, which was the boundary of the two sections.” Strabo, in\r\nthe text, points out the falsity of this argument.\r\n\r\n[592] Viz. 6700 stadia.\r\n\r\n[593] These two words, _continues Hipparchus_, are not in the text, but\r\nthe argument is undoubtedly his.\r\n\r\n[594] Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\n[595] 400 stadia, allowing 700 to a degree, would give 34’ 17” latitude.\r\nAccording to present astronomical calculations, the distance between the\r\nparallels of Rhodes and Athens is 1° 36’ 30”.\r\n\r\n[596] Viz. 400 stadia, or 34’ 17” of latitude.\r\n\r\n[597] The difference of latitude between Thapsacus and Pelusium is about\r\n4° 27’.\r\n\r\n[598] The text here is evidently corrupt.\r\n\r\n[599] Gosselin makes some sensible remarks on this section; we have\r\nendeavoured to render it accurately, but much fear that the true meaning\r\nof Strabo is now obscured by corruptions in the text.\r\n\r\n[600] Moadieh, the mouth of the river close to Aboukir.\r\n\r\n[601] Certain little islets at the mouth of the canal of Constantinople,\r\nin the Black Sea. These islands want about a degree and a quarter of\r\nbeing under the same meridian as Moadieh.\r\n\r\n[602] Gosselin remarks, that the defile intended by Strabo, was probably\r\nthe valley of the river Kur, or the ancient Cyrus, in Georgia; and by\r\nMount Caspius we are to understand the high mountains of Georgia, whence\r\nthe waters, which fall on one side into the Black Sea, and on the other\r\ninto the Caspian, take their rise.\r\n\r\n[603] Gosselin also observes, that on our charts this distance is about\r\n8100 stadia of 700 to a degree. Consequently the difference between the\r\nmeridian of Thapsacus and that of Mount Caspius is as much as 4° 45’, in\r\nplace of the 300 stadia, or from 25’ to 26’ supposed by Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[604] On the contrary, Mount Caspius is east of the meridian of\r\nThapsacus by about 2500 stadia, of 700 to a degree.\r\n\r\n[605] Now Iskouriah. Dioscurias, however, is 800 stadia from the Phasis,\r\nof 700 to a degree.\r\n\r\n[606] According to our improved charts, the distance from the meridian\r\nof the Cyaneæ to that of the Phasis is 6800 stadia, of 700 to a degree;\r\nfrom the Cyaneæ to Mount Caspius, 8080.\r\n\r\n[607] The meridian of Mount Caspius is about 2625 stadia nearer the\r\nCaspian Gates than that of Thapsacus.\r\n\r\n[608] μετὰ τὸν Πόντον, literally, after the Pontus.\r\n\r\n[609] Gosselin observes, that Eratosthenes took a general view of the\r\nsalient points of land that jutted into the Mediterranean, as some of\r\nthe learned of our own time have done, when remarking that most of the\r\ncontinents terminated in capes, extending towards the south. The first\r\npromontory that Eratosthenes speaks of terminated in Cape Malea of the\r\nPeloponnesus, and comprised the whole of Greece; the Italian promontory\r\nlikewise terminated Italy; the Ligurian promontory was reckoned to\r\ninclude all Spain, it terminated at Cape Tarifa, near to the middle of\r\nthe Strait of Gibraltar. As the Ligurians had obtained possession of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the coasts of France and Spain, that part of the\r\nMediterranean which washes the shores of those countries was named the\r\nLigurian Sea. It extended from the Arno to the Strait of Gibraltar. It\r\nis in accordance with this nomenclature that Eratosthenes called Cape\r\nTarifa, which projects farthest into the Strait, the Ligurian\r\npromontory.\r\n\r\n[610] Cape Colonna.\r\n\r\n[611] Cape Malio, or St. Angelo.\r\n\r\n[612] Strabo means the Saronic Gulf, now the Bay of Engia.\r\n\r\n[613] The peninsula of Gallipoli by the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[614] πρὸς τὸ Σούνιον. Strabo’s meaning is, that the entire space of\r\nsea, bounded on the north by the Thracian Chersonesus, and on the south\r\nby Sunium, or Cape Colonna, forms a kind of large gulf.\r\n\r\n[615] Or Black Gulf; the Gulf of Saros.\r\n\r\n[616] The Gulfs of Contessa, Monte-Santo, Cassandra, and Salonica.\r\n\r\n[617] Durazzo, on the coast of Albania.\r\n\r\n[618] The Gulf of Salonica.\r\n\r\n[619] Read 13,500 stadia.\r\n\r\n[620] It was an error alike shared in by Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and\r\nStrabo, that Alexandria and Rhodes were under the same meridian,\r\nnotwithstanding the former of these cities is 2° 22’ 45” east of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n[621] This is an error peculiar to Eratosthenes. The meridians of\r\nCarthage and the Strait of Messina differ by 5° 45’.\r\n\r\n[622] The Strait of Messina.\r\n\r\n[623] Spain and France.\r\n\r\n[624] The Getæ occupied the east of Moldavia and Bessarabia, between the\r\nDanube and the Dniester. The Bastarnæ inhabited the north of Moldavia\r\nand a part of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n[625] The Greek has simply, κατὰ τὴν ἠπειρῶτιν, _in the continent_, but\r\nStrabo, by this expression, only meant to designate those parts of the\r\ncontinent best known and nearest to the Greeks. The other countries, in\r\nregard to which he pleads for some indulgence to be shown to\r\nEratosthenes, are equally in the same continent. Kramer and other\r\neditors suspect an error in the text here.\r\n\r\n[626] According to Plutarch, both Thales and Pythagoras had divided the\r\nearth into five zones. Since Parmenides lived one hundred and fifty\r\nyears after the first of these philosophers, he cannot be considered the\r\nauthor of this division. As Posidonius and Strabo estimated the breadth\r\nof the torrid zone at 8800 stadia, and Parmenides is said to have nearly\r\ndoubled it, this would give 17,600 stadia, or 25° 8’ 34”, taking this\r\nat 25° it would appear that Parmenides extended the torrid zone one\r\ndegree beyond the tropics.\r\n\r\n[627] The Arctic Circles of the ancients were not the same as ours, but\r\nvaried for every latitude. Aristotle limited the temperate zone to those\r\ncountries which had the constellation of the crown in their Arctic\r\nCircle, the brilliant star of that constellation in his time had a\r\nnorthern declination of about 36° 30’, consequently he did not reckon\r\nthat the temperate zone reached farther north or south than 53° and a\r\nhalf. We shall see that Strabo adopted much the same opinion, fixing the\r\nnorthern bounds of the habitable earth at 54° 25’ 42”. Gosselin.\r\n\r\n[628] For the circumference.\r\n\r\n[629] Viz. none for those who dwell under the equator, or at the poles.\r\n\r\n[630] Strabo’s argument seems to be this. It matters but little that\r\nthere may not be Arctic Circles for every latitude, since for the\r\ninhabitants of the temperate zone they do certainly exist, and these are\r\nthe only people of whom we have any knowledge. But at the same time the\r\nobjection is unanswerable, that as these circles differ in respect to\r\nvarious countries, it is quite impossible that they can fix uniformly\r\nthe limits of the temperate zone.\r\n\r\n[631] The polar circles, where the shadow, in the summer season, travels\r\nall round in the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[632] Those who live north and south of the tropics, or in the temperate\r\nzones, and at noon have a shadow only falling one way.\r\n\r\n[633] Having at mid-day in alternate seasons the shadow falling north\r\nand south.\r\n\r\n[634] Viz. Posidonius allowed for each of these small zones a breadth of\r\nabout 30’, or 350 stadia, of 700 to a degree.\r\n\r\n[635] A plant, the juice of which was used in food and medicine. Bentley\r\nsupposes it to be the asa-fœtida, still much eaten as a relish in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[636] Posidonius was here mistaken; witness the Niger, the Senegal, the\r\nGambia, &c.\r\n\r\n[637] The expression of Strabo is so concise as to leave it extremely\r\ndoubtful whether or not he meant to include the human race in his\r\nstatement. Looking at this passage, however, in connexion with another\r\nin the 15th Book, we are inclined to answer the question in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n[638] Or _living on fish_, a name given by the Greek geographers to\r\nvarious tribes of barbarians; but it seems most frequently to a people\r\nof Gedrosia on the coast of the Arabian Gulf. It is probably to these\r\nthat Strabo refers.\r\n\r\n[639] Viz. the Heteroscii, or inhabitants of the temperate zones.\r\n\r\n[640] The ancients named the people of southern Africa, Ethiopians;\r\nthose of the north of Asia and Europe, Scythians; and those of the\r\nnorth-west of Europe, Kelts.\r\n\r\n[641] That is, by arctic circles which differed in respect to various\r\nlatitudes. See Book ii. chap. ii. § 2, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[642] Viz. the partition of the earth into two hemispheres, by means of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\n[643] Gosselin concludes from this that Eratosthenes and Polybius gave\r\nto the earth the form of a spheroid flattened at the poles. Other\r\nphilosophers supposed it was elongated at the poles, and flattened at\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\n[644] Gosselin justly observes that this passage, which is so concise as\r\nto appear doubtful to some, is properly explained by a quotation from\r\nGeminus, which states the arguments adduced by Polybius for believing\r\nthat there was a temperate region within the torrid zones.\r\n\r\n[645] Strabo seems to confound the account (Herodotus iv. 44) of the\r\nexpedition sent by Darius round southern Persia and Arabia with the\r\ncircumnavigation of Libya, (Herod. iv. 42,) which Necho II. confided to\r\nthe Phœnicians about 600 B. C., commanding them distinctly “to return to\r\nEgypt through the passage of the Pillars of Hercules.” See Humboldt’s\r\nCosmos, ii. 488, note, Bohn’s edition.\r\n\r\n[646] Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, flourished towards the end of the fifth\r\ncentury before Christ.\r\n\r\n[647] The ruins of this city still preserve the name of Cyzik. It was\r\nsituated on the peninsula of Artaki, on the south of the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[648] Games in honour of Proserpine, or Cora.\r\n\r\n[649] Ptolemy VII., king of Egypt, also styled Euergetes II.; he is more\r\ncommonly known by the surname of Physcon. His reign commenced B. C. 170.\r\n\r\n[650] The ancients believed that crystals consisted of water which had\r\nbeen frozen by excessive cold, and remained congealed for centuries.\r\nVide Pliny, lib. xxxvii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[651] Cleopatra, besides being the wife, was also the niece of Ptolemy,\r\nbeing the offspring of his former wife, whom he had divorced, by her\r\nformer marriage with Philometor.\r\n\r\n[652] Ptolemy VIII. was nominally king, but his mother Cleopatra still\r\nheld most of the real authority in her hands.\r\n\r\n[653] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[654] Western Mauritania, the modern kingdom of Fez.\r\n\r\n[655] This river is now named Lucos, and its mouth, which is about 30\r\nleagues distant from Cadiz, is called Larais or Larache.\r\n\r\n[656] Humboldt, Cosmos ii. 489, note, mentions the remains of a ship of\r\nthe Red Sea having been brought to the coast of Crete by westerly\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n[657] Pozzuolo, close by Naples.\r\n\r\n[658] Gosselin observes, that this steady westerly wind, so far from\r\ncarrying him towards India, would be entirely adverse to him in coasting\r\nalong Africa, and doubling Cape Bojador; and infers from hence that\r\nEudoxus never really went that expedition, and that Strabo himself was\r\nignorant of the true position of Africa.\r\n\r\n[659] A name common to many sovereigns of the different parts of\r\nMauritania; the king Bogus, or Bocchus, here spoken of, governed the\r\nkingdom of Fez.\r\n\r\n[660] Round Africa.\r\n\r\n[661] A term by which incredible narrations were designated. It owes its\r\norigin to Antiphanes, a writer born at Bergè, a city of Thrace, and\r\nfamous for trumping up false and auld-world stories. Βεργαΐζειν, was a\r\nproverbial and polite term for lying.\r\n\r\n[662] The wall mentioned in Iliad, vii. 436, _et seq._ Gosselin says\r\nthat in the time of Aristotle the commentators of the Iliad, having\r\nvainly sought for the ruins or other traces of the wall, the Philosopher\r\ncame to the conclusion that the wall was altogether a fiction of\r\nHomer’s. Strabo speaks further on this subject in the 13th Book.\r\n\r\n[663] As the above assertion is at variance with the statement of\r\nStrabo, in his 7th Book, concerning Posidonius’s views on this subject,\r\nit seems probable that the passage as it stands is corrupt. It is more\r\nlikely Strabo wrote, “It is the opinion of Posidonius that the\r\nemigration of the Cimbrians and other kindred races from their native\r\nterritory was _not_ occasioned by an inundation of the sea, since their\r\ndeparture took place at various times.”\r\n\r\n[664] Odyssey i. 23.\r\n\r\n[665] Aratus, who lived about B. C. 270, was the author of two Greek\r\nastronomical poems, called Φαινόμενα and Διοσημεία. It is from the\r\nformer of these that the above quotation is taken. Aratus, Phænom. v.\r\n61.\r\n\r\n[666] Evemerus, or Euhemerus, a Sicilian author of the time of Alexander\r\nthe Great and his immediate successors, and a native of Messina. He is\r\nsaid to have sailed down the Red Sea and round the southern coasts of\r\nAsia to a very great distance, until he came to an island called\r\nPanchæa. After his return from this voyage, he wrote a work entitled\r\nἹερὰ Ἀναγραφή, which consisted of at least nine books. The title of this\r\n“Sacred History,” as we may call it, was taken from the ἀναγραφαί, or\r\nthe inscriptions on columns and walls, which existed in great numbers in\r\nthe temples of Greece; and Euhemerus chose it, because he pretended to\r\nhave derived his information from public documents of that kind, which\r\nhe had discovered in his travels, especially in the island of Panchæa.\r\nThe work contained accounts of the several gods, whom Euhemerus\r\nrepresented as having originally been men who had distinguished\r\nthemselves either as warriors, kings, inventors, or benefactors of\r\nmankind, and who, after their death, were worshipped as gods by the\r\ngrateful people. This book, which seems to have been written in a\r\npopular style, must have been very attractive; for all the fables of\r\nmythology were dressed up in it as so many true narratives; and many of\r\nthe subsequent historians adopted his mode of dealing with myths, or at\r\nleast followed in his track, as we find to be the case with Polybius and\r\nDionysius. Vide Smith.\r\n\r\n[667] Every one will observe, that this criticism of Strabo is entirely\r\ngratuitous and captious. Polybius cites Dicæarchus as a most credulous\r\nwriter, but states that even he would not believe Pytheas: how then\r\ncould so distinguished a writer as Eratosthenes put faith in his\r\nnonsense?\r\n\r\n[668] On the contrary, the distance in a right line from Cape Tenarum,\r\noff the Peloponnesus, to the recess of the Adriatic Gulf, is only about\r\nhalf the distance from the Peloponnesus to the Pillars of Hercules. This\r\nmistake of Dicæarchus is a proof of the very slight acquaintance the\r\nGreeks could have had with the western portions of the Mediterranean in\r\nhis time, about 320 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[669] Literally, “He assigns 3000 to the interval which stretches\r\ntowards the Pillars as far as the Strait, and 7000 from the Strait to\r\nthe Pillars.” The distance from Cape Tenarum to the Strait of Messina is\r\nin proportion to the distance from the Strait of Messina to Gibraltar,\r\nabout 3 to 10, not 3 to 7, as given by Dicæarchus.\r\n\r\n[670] That part of the Mediterranean which lies on the coast of Italy,\r\nfrom the mouth of the Arno to Naples.\r\n\r\n[671] The sea which washes the western coast of Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[672] Viz. from the Peloponnesus to the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[673] Santa Maura, an island in the Ionian Sea.\r\n\r\n[674] Corfu.\r\n\r\n[675] The mountains of Chimera, forming the Cape della Linguetta on the\r\ncoast of Albania.\r\n\r\n[676] The maritime portion of Liburnia, comprised between the coasts of\r\nDalmatia and Istria. It is now comprehended in the district of Murlaka.\r\n\r\n[677] In all 8250 stadia.\r\n\r\n[678] Issus, now Aïas, a town of Cilicia on the confines of Syria,\r\nfamous for the battle between Alexander the Great and Darius, in\r\nconsequence of which it was called Nicopolis.\r\n\r\n[679] Salamoni.\r\n\r\n[680] Cape Krio.\r\n\r\n[681] Cape Passaro.\r\n\r\n[682] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[683] Total 28,500 stadia.\r\n\r\n[684] Spoken of by Polybius.\r\n\r\n[685] The Gulf of Genoa.\r\n\r\n[686] These measures are taken along the coast, in stadia of 700 to a\r\ndegree. Of these, from Marseilles to Gibraltar there are 9300, and from\r\nthe ancient promontory of Pyrenæum to Gibraltar 7380. Consequently the\r\ncorrections of Polybius were neither inaccurate nor uncalled for.\r\n\r\n[687] These 6000 stadia, taken in a direct line, are just the distance\r\nfrom Cape St. Vincent to the chain of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[688] Kelts.\r\n\r\n[689] The rising of the sun in summer.\r\n\r\n[690] The east.\r\n\r\n[691] This is an error into which Strabo fell with most of the ancient\r\ngeographers. The course of the Don certainly begins from the north, but\r\nafterwards it turns eastward, and then suddenly shifts to the west. So\r\nthat its entire course as known in the time of Strabo, differed from the\r\nPalus Mæotis and Sea of Azof by about 9 degrees of longitude. Polybius\r\nis here more exact than Strabo.\r\n\r\n[692] Palus Mæotis.\r\n\r\n[693] This was the opinion of Theophanes of Mytilene, who followed\r\nPompey in his expeditions to the East. The Caucasus here mentioned is\r\nthat which bounds Georgia in the north, and from whence the modern river\r\nKuban (the Vardanus of Pompey) takes its rise. This river does incline\r\nslightly to the north, and afterwards turns westward in its course to\r\nthe Palus Mæotis. It is possible that some confusion between this river\r\nand the Don gave occasion to the belief that the latter rose in the\r\nCaucasus.\r\n\r\n[694] Cape Malio, in the Morea. See also Humboldt’s Cosmos ii. 482.\r\n\r\n[695] Cape Malio. Gosselin is of opinion that some omission has occurred\r\nin this passage, and proposes to substitute the following: “The two\r\nformer of these Polybius describes in the same manner as Eratosthenes,\r\nbut he subdivides the third. He comprehends within Cape Malea all the\r\nPeloponnesus; within Cape Sunium the whole of Greece, Illyria, and a\r\npart of Thrace.”\r\n\r\n[696] Cape Colonna.\r\n\r\n[697] The Strait of the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[698] The Rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[699] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[700] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[701] The Italian Promontory.\r\n\r\n[702] The Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n[703] Capo di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[704] ἡ δὲ φυσικὴ ἀρετή τις. We learn from the work entitled De Placitis\r\nPhilosophorum, commonly attributed to Plutarch, that the Stoics\r\ndignified with the name of ἀρεταὶ, the three sciences of Physics,\r\nEthics, and Logic, Φυσικὴ, Ἠθικὴ, Λογικὴ. The exact meaning of ἀρετὴ in\r\nthese instances it is impossible to give, and Strabo’s own explanation\r\nis perhaps the best that can be had; we have here rendered it, “perfect\r\nscience,” for want of a better phrase.\r\n\r\n[705] Φυσικοὶ.\r\n\r\n[706] We have followed the suggestion of Gosselin in reading τῷ ὅλῳ,\r\n_the whole_, instead of τῷ πόλῳ, _the pole_, as in the text. Strabo\r\nhaving just previously stated that the _axis_ of the earth was\r\n_stationary_, it does not seem probable that he would immediately after\r\nspeak of the _motion_ of the _pole_.\r\n\r\n[707] Odyssey xi. 156, 157.\r\n\r\n[708] From this point Strabo, strictly speaking, commences his\r\nexposition of the principles of Geography.\r\n\r\n[709] Strabo supposed this circle at a distance of 38,100 stadia from\r\nthe equator, or 54° 25’ 42” of latitude.\r\n\r\n[710] The whole of what follows to the end of the section is extremely\r\nembarrassing in the original; we must therefore claim the indulgence of\r\nthe reader for any obscurity he may find in the translation.\r\n\r\n[711] The Greeks, besides the division of the equator into 360 degrees,\r\nhad also another method of dividing it into sixty portions or degrees.\r\n\r\n[712] These 21,800 stadia would give to Alexandria a latitude of 31° 8’\r\n34”; according to modern calculation it is 31° 11’ 20” of latitude.\r\nThe following presents Strabo’s calculations of the latitude of the\r\npreceding places in a tabular form.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |                               | Particular| Total    | Latitudes.  |\r\n  |       Names of places.        | Distance. | Distance.|             |\r\n  |                               |           |          |             |\r\n  +-------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |                               |   Stadia. |  Stadia. |             |\r\n  | Equator                       |        0  |       0  |  0°  0’  0” |\r\n  | Limits of the habitable earth |     8800  |    8800  | 12° 34’ 17” |\r\n  | Meroe                         |     3000  |   11800  | 16° 51’ 25” |\r\n  | Syene and the Tropic          |     5000  |   16800  | 24°  0’  0” |\r\n  | Alexandria                    |     5000  |   21800  | 31°  8’ 34” |\r\n  +-------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n[713] Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and Strabo, all believed that the\r\nlongitude of Rhodes was the same as that of Alexandria, although\r\nactually it is 2° 22’ 45” west of that place. The coasts of Caria,\r\nIonia, and the Troad incline considerably to the west, while Byzantium\r\nis about 3° east of the Troad, and the mouth of the Dnieper is above 3°\r\n46’ east of Byzantium.\r\n\r\n[714] The Roxolani inhabited the Ukraine. It has been thought that from\r\nthese people the Russians derived their name.\r\n\r\n[715] Strabo here alludes to Ireland, which he placed north of England,\r\nand believed to be the most northerly region fitted for the habitation\r\nof man. He gave it a latitude of 36,700 stadia, equivalent to 52° 25’\r\n42”, which answers to the southern portions of that island.\r\n\r\n[716] The Sauromatæ, or Sarmatians, occupied the lands north of the sea\r\nof Azof on either side of the Don.\r\n\r\n[717] The Scythians here spoken of dwelt between the Don and the Wolga;\r\neast of this last river were the Eastern Scythians, who were thought to\r\noccupy the whole north of Asia.\r\n\r\n[718] The tropic being placed at 24° from the equator by Strabo, and\r\nmost probably by Pytheas also, the latitude of Thule, according to the\r\nobservation of this traveller, would be fixed at 66°, which corresponds\r\nwith the north of Iceland.\r\n\r\n[719] Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[720] Hipparchus placed Marseilles and Byzantium at 30,142 stadia, or\r\n43° 3’ 38” of latitude, and estimated the parallel for the centre of\r\nBritain at 33,942 stadia, or 48° 29’ 19”. Whereas Strabo only allowed\r\nfor this latter 32,700 stadia, or 46° 42’ 51”.\r\n\r\n[721] Viz. the 36° of latitude. The actual latitudes are as follow:\r\n\r\n   The Pillars of Hercules, or Strait of Gibraltar, 36°.\r\n   The Strait of Messina, 38° 12’.\r\n   Athens, 38° 5’.\r\n   The middle of the Isle of Rhodes, 36° 18’; and the city, 36° 28’ 30”.\r\n\r\n[722] This mistake of Strabo caused the derangement in his chart of the\r\nwhole contour of this portion of the Mediterranean, and falsifies the\r\nposition of the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\n[723] Strabo having allowed 25,400 stadia, or 36° 17’ 8”, for the\r\nlatitude of Rhodes and the Strait of Messina, determined the latitude of\r\nMarseilles at 27,700 stadia, or 39° 34’ 17”; its real latitude being 43°\r\n17’ 45”, as exactly stated by Pytheas.\r\n\r\n[724] Or about 7°. The actual difference in latitude between Rhodes and\r\nByzantium is 4° 32’ 54”.\r\n\r\n[725] On the contrary, Marseilles is 2° 16’ 21” north of Byzantium.\r\n\r\n[726] 3800 stadia, or 5° 25’ 43”.\r\n\r\n[727] The following is a tabular form of the latitudes as stated by\r\nStrabo:\r\n\r\n                                                     Stadia.

He\r\ntravelled through Egypt and reached Philæ, which is about 100 stadia\r\nabove Syene, the commencement of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n[732] The Getæ occupied a portion of present Moldavia; the Tyrigetæ were\r\nthose of the Getæ who dwelt along the banks of the Tyras or Dniester.\r\n\r\n[733] The Bastarnæ occupied the south and eastern portions of Poland.\r\n\r\n[734] The Georgians of the present day.\r\n\r\n[735] Corcan.\r\n\r\n[736] The precise time when this writer lived is unknown.

This expedition into\r\nArabia completely failed, through the treachery of the guide, a Roman\r\nnamed Syllæus. A long account of it is given by Strabo in the 16th book.\r\n“It would be extremely interesting,” says Professor Schmitz, “to trace\r\nthis expedition of Ælius Gallus into Arabia, but our knowledge of that\r\ncountry is as yet too scanty to enable us to identify the route as\r\ndescribed by Strabo, who derived most of his information about Arabia\r\nfrom his friend Ælius Gallus.”\r\n\r\n[738] Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[739] Myos-hormos, _Mouse’s Harbour_, a sea-port of Egypt on the coast\r\nof the Red Sea. Arrian says that it was one of the most celebrated ports\r\non this sea. It was chosen by Ptolemy Philadelphus for the convenience\r\nof commerce, in preference to Arsinoë or _Suez_, on account of the\r\ndifficulty of navigating the western extremity of the gulf. It was\r\ncalled also Aphroditis Portus, or the Port of Venus. Its modern name is\r\nSuffange-el-Bahri, or “Sponge of the Sea.” _Lemprière._\r\n\r\n[740] Humboldt commends Strabo’s zeal in prosecuting his gigantic work,\r\nCosmos ii. 557.\r\n\r\n[741] The Gulf of Aïas.\r\n\r\n[742] The Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\n[743] Strabo seems here to confound the parallel of Ierna with that of\r\nthe northern limits of the habitable earth, although a little above, as\r\nwe have seen, he determines these limits at 15,000 stadia north of\r\nIerna.\r\n\r\n[744] These narrowed extremities of the continent are, Spain on the\r\nwest, terminated by Cape St. Vincent, and on the east the peninsula of\r\nIndia, terminated by Cape Comorin. This cape Strabo supposed was\r\ncontinued in an easterly direction, and thus formed the most eastern\r\nportion of Asia.\r\n\r\n[745] The island of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[746] Strabo supposed the Hyrcanian or Caspian Sea communicated with the\r\nnorthern ocean.\r\n\r\n[747] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[748] Cape St. Vincent is north of Cadiz by 30’ 30”, north of the Strait\r\nof Gibraltar, or Pillars of Hercules, by 1° 2’, south of the Strait of\r\nMessina by 1° 10’, and north of Rhodes by 33’ 30”.\r\n\r\n[749] Casaubon conjectures that the words τὸν Κάνωβον originally\r\noccupied the space of the lacuna. The passage would then stand thus—From\r\nthe coast of Cadiz and Iberia the star Canopus is said to have been\r\nformerly observed. Groskurd rejects this, and proposes to read τοὺς\r\nπλησιαιτάτους τοῦ Κανώβου ἀστέρας, “the stars nearest to Canopus.” But\r\nthis too is not certain, and the passage is otherwise evidently corrupt.\r\n\r\n[750] The most southern.\r\n\r\n[751] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[752] The Artabri inhabited the country around Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[753] Principally contained in the modern kingdom of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[754] The Scilly Islands off the Cornwall coast.\r\n\r\n[755] We have long had the custom of tracing on every map the parallels\r\nof latitude and longitude at every degree, or every five or ten degrees,\r\nas the case may be. By means of these lines drawn at equal distances,\r\nthe eye at once recognises the relative position of any place in the\r\nmap. This method was not in use when Strabo wrote: at that time it was\r\ncustomary to draw a meridian or longitude, and a parallel of latitude,\r\nfor every important place of which the position was considered as\r\ndetermined. This was certainly an obscure way of dividing the globe;\r\nnevertheless it is requisite to keep it in mind, in order that we may\r\nthe more readily understand the general language of our geographer, who\r\ninstead of simply stating the latitude and longitude of places, says\r\nsuch a place is situated under the same latitude, or about the same\r\nlatitude, as such another place, &c. Ptolemy seems to have been the\r\nfirst who freed the study of geography from the confusion inseparable\r\nfrom the ancient method. He substituted tables easy of construction and\r\namendment; where the position of each place was marked by isolated\r\nnumbers, which denoted the exact latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\n[756] Demosthenes, Philipp. III. edit. Reisk. t. i. p. 117, l.\r\n22.—Demosthenes is here alluding to the cities which different Grecian\r\ncolonies had founded in the maritime districts of Thrace. The principal\r\nof these was the opulent and populous city of Olynthus, which, together\r\nwith others, was taken, and razed to its foundations, by Philip of\r\nMacedon. Olynthus has become famous through the three orations of\r\nDemosthenes, urging the Athenians to its succour.\r\n\r\n[757] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[758] The entrance to the Arabian Gulf is about six or seven marine\r\nleagues, that of the Mediterranean two and three-fourths.

It was comprehended between the\r\nsouthern coasts of Crete, the western coasts of Peloponnesus, the\r\nsouthern coasts of Macedonia and Thrace, and the western borders of Asia\r\nMinor. Strabo however, in his description, seems to comprise under the\r\nname of the Ægæan not only those parts of the Mediterranean south of the\r\nmeridian of Cape Matapan, but also the Propontis and the Euxine, as far\r\nas the mouth of the river Halys, now Kizil-Irmak. In this however he\r\nseems to be unique.\r\n\r\n[854] This is just the distance, says Gosselin, from the northern part\r\nof Rhodes to Alexandria, but the route, instead of being from north to\r\nsouth, as supposed by the ancients, is S.

France was\r\ndesignated Transalpine Gaul.\r\n\r\n[874] The Tyrrhenian or Tuscan Sea commenced about the mouth of the\r\nArno, and extended as far as Naples. The Ligurian Sea is the Gulf of\r\nGenoa. The Ausonian Sea, afterwards called the Sea of Sicily, washes the\r\nsouthern parts of Italy. The Adriatic Gulf, is the Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n[875] The Getæ inhabited Moldavia. The Tyrigetæ, or Getæ of Tyras or the\r\nDniester, dwelt on the banks of that river. The Bastarnæ inhabited the\r\nUkraine. The Sarmatians, or Sauromatians, extended along either bank of\r\nthe Don and the environs of the Sea of Azof, the ancient Palus Mæotis.\r\n\r\n[876] Thrace and Macedonia form part of the modern Roumelia: Illyria\r\ncomprehended Dalmatia, Bosnia, Croatia, &c.\r\n\r\n[877] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[878] The Scilly Isles.\r\n\r\n[879] Majorca and Minorca.\r\n\r\n[880] Iviça, Formentera, Spalmador, &c.

The Hyrcanians are\r\nthe inhabitants of Daghistan and the Corcan. The Parthians occupied the\r\nnorth of Khorasan; the Bactrians the country of Balk. The Sogdians\r\ninhabited Bukaria, where are Samarcand and the valley of Al-Sogd.\r\n\r\n[894] Mingrelia.\r\n\r\n[895] Cappadocia comprehended a portion of the modern Roum and Karamania\r\nbetween the Euphrates and the river Halys.\r\n\r\n[896] Under this name Strabo included a portion of the kingdom of Pontus\r\nand other small tribes as far as Colchis.\r\n\r\n[897] Now the Kizil-Irmak.\r\n\r\n[898] The northern and western portions of Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[899] Probably an interpolation.\r\n\r\n[900] The mountaineers of Paropamisus were those who inhabited the\r\nmountains which separate Bactriana from India. The Parthians occupied\r\nthe mountains north of the modern Khorasan. Under the name of Medians\r\nStrabo comprehends the various nations who inhabited the mountainous\r\ncountry between Parthia and Armenia. The Cilicians inhabited Aladeuli;\r\nthe Lycaonian mountaineers the mountains which separate Karaman from\r\nItch-iili; and the Pisidians the country of Hamid.\r\n\r\n[901] The Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\n[902] Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[903] The Arians inhabited Sigistan and a part of modern Persia. Strabo\r\ngave the name of Arians to all the people who occupied the portions of\r\nAsia comprised between the Indus and Persia, and between the chain of\r\nthe Taurus and Gedrosia and Carmania. In after-times the designation of\r\nArians was restricted to the inhabitants of the modern Khorasan.\r\nGedrosia is Mekran; Carmania yet preserves the name of Kerman.\r\n\r\n[904] Ancient Persia is the modern province of Fars, Pars, or Paras; our\r\nPersia being much more extensive than the ancient country designated by\r\nthe same name.\r\n\r\n[905] The Susians inhabited the modern Khosistan.\r\n\r\n[906] The Babylonians occupied the present Irak-Arabi.\r\n\r\n[907] Now al-Djezira.\r\n\r\n[908] Viz. the Ethiopians occupying the territory from Syene to\r\nAbyssinia.\r\n\r\n[909] The Troglodyte Arabians.\r\n\r\n[910] The Cilicians occupied the modern Itch-iili and Aladeuli; the\r\nTrachiotæ or mountaineers, the former of these countries.\r\n\r\n[911] Pamphylia is the modern Tekieh.\r\n\r\n[912] Or Oases, according to the common spelling.\r\n\r\n[913] That is to say, from Tunis to Gibraltar. The Maurusians, called by\r\nthe Latins Mauritanians, occupied the present Algiers and Fez.\r\n\r\n[914] Probably asa-fœtida.\r\n\r\n[915] The Troglodytic extended along the western coast of the Arabian\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\n[916] The Ichthyophagi of Gedrosia inhabited the barren coasts of\r\nMekran.\r\n\r\n[917] The term of Ethiopians was a generic name given by the Greeks and\r\nRomans to the most southern inhabitants of Africa they at any time\r\nhappened to be acquainted with; consequently the position of this\r\ncountry frequently shifted.\r\n\r\n[918] The Garamantæ inhabited the Kawan; Garama, their capital, is now\r\nnamed Gherma. The Pharusians and Nigritæ dwelt south of the present\r\nkingdom of Morocco.\r\n\r\n[919] The Marmaridæ extended west from Egypt, as far as Catabathmus,\r\nnear the present Cape Luco.\r\n\r\n[920] Viz. to the south and west.\r\n\r\n[921] The Gulfs of Sydra and Cabes.\r\n\r\n[922] The Psylli and Nasamones inhabited the eastern parts of the\r\npresent kingdom of Tripoli, above the Greater Syrtes and the desert of\r\nBarca.\r\n\r\n[923] The Asbystæ were a people of Libya above Cyrene, where the temple\r\nof Ammon stood; Jupiter is sometimes called on that account Asbysteus.\r\n\r\n[924] The Byzacii occupied the southern parts of the kingdom of Tunis.\r\n\r\n[925] Greek, Nomades, or wandering shepherds, from which the Latins\r\nformed the name Numidæ. These people inhabited Algiers.\r\n\r\n[926] Carthage extended as far west as the promontory of Tretum, now\r\nSebta-Ras or the Seven Heads. From thence the Masylies inhabited as far\r\nas Cape Carbon; and from thence the Masæsylii possessed the country as\r\nfar as the river Molochath, now the Maluia, beyond which were the\r\nMaurusians extending to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[927] Numidæ.\r\n\r\n[928] The climata are zones parallel to the equator. The ancients\r\ngenerally reckoned seven climata, which in the time of Hipparchus\r\nterminated at 48° 30’ 35”, where the longest day consisted of sixteen\r\nhours. He however multiplied these divisions and extended them farther\r\ntowards the poles. It is a great pity that Strabo has not noted all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[929] According to Strabo, 12° 34’ 17”.\r\n\r\n[930] According to Strabo, 52° 25’ 42”.\r\n\r\n[931] Now Gherri, on the banks of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[932] i. e. they are the most southern of those for whom, &c.\r\n\r\n[933] Bab-el-Mandeb, The Gate of Tears.\r\n\r\n[934] The east.\r\n\r\n[935] The west.\r\n\r\n[936] This passage proves that in Strabo’s opinion the continent of\r\nAfrica did not extend so far south as the equator.\r\n\r\n[937] This town was sometimes called Ptolemais Epitheras, having been\r\nbuilt by Eumedes in the reign of Philadelphus for the chase of elephants\r\nand other wild animals.\r\n\r\n[938] On the west.\r\n\r\n[939] The east.\r\n\r\n[940] About Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\n[941] The east.\r\n\r\n[942] The west.\r\n\r\n[943] Kramer follows Gosselin in proposing to substitute τρία in place\r\nof ἑπτά.\r\n\r\n[944] The west side.\r\n\r\n[945] Algiers and Fez.\r\n\r\n[946] The eastern side.\r\n\r\n[947] Lower Egypt is intended.\r\n\r\n[948] Khosistan.\r\n\r\n[949] The modern province of Fars.\r\n\r\n[950] Kerman.\r\n\r\n[951] Upper Mekran.\r\n\r\n[952] S. Jean d’Acre.\r\n\r\n[953] Seide.\r\n\r\n[954] Tsur.\r\n\r\n[955] Eksenide.\r\n\r\n[956] Siragusa.\r\n\r\n[957] Caria occupied the southern and western parts of Anadoli, near the\r\nIsland of Rhodes. Lycaonia formed a part of the modern Karaman. Cataonia\r\nwas comprised in Aladeuli. Media is now Irak-Adjami. The Caspian Gates\r\nare the defiles of Firouz-Koh.\r\n\r\n[958] Eski-Stambul.\r\n\r\n[959] Emboli or Jamboli.\r\n\r\n[960] Polina.\r\n\r\n[961] Isnik.\r\n\r\n[962] Eksemil.\r\n\r\n[963] Karasi in Anadoli.\r\n\r\n[964] Sinop.\r\n\r\n[965] Corcan and Daghistan.\r\n\r\n[966] Balk.\r\n\r\n[967] To the north.\r\n\r\n[968] Or 17° 30’. This would indicate a latitude of 48° 38’ 40”.\r\n\r\n[969] The astronomical cubit was equal to two degrees.\r\n\r\n[970] Read 23,100.\r\n\r\n[971] The northern extremity of the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n[972] Κόσμος, the universe.\r\n\r\n[973] The pole of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n[974] The neck, &c.\r\n\r\n[975] The Pyrenees, on the contrary, range from east to west, with a\r\nslight inclination towards the north. This error gives occasion to\r\nseveral of the mistakes made by Strabo respecting the course of certain\r\nof the rivers in France.\r\n\r\n[976] France.\r\n\r\n[977] The Gulfs of Lyons and Gascony.\r\n\r\n[978] Gosselin remarks that the distance between S. Jean de Luz and\r\nTarragona, is rather less than that between Bayonne and Narbonne.\r\n\r\n[979] The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[980] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[981] Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[982] Africa.\r\n\r\n[983] The Mauritanians.\r\n\r\n[984] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[985] Cape St. Vincent is about 1600 stadia west of Cape Spartel in\r\nAfrica. Strabo imagined that beyond this cape the African coast inclined\r\nto the south-east. In reality it advances eleven degrees and a half\r\nfarther west to Cape Verd, which is 8° 29’ west of Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[986] Herodotus is the first who speaks of a people of Iberia, to whom\r\nhe gives the name of Κυνήσιοι or Κύνητες: he describes them as\r\ninhabiting the most western part of Europe, beyond the Pillars of\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\n[987] This passage of Strabo relative to the rocking-stones has\r\noccasioned much perplexity to the critics. We have attempted to render\r\nthe Greek words as near as possible. Many curious facts relative to\r\nrocking and amber stones have been collected, by Jabez Allies, F. S. A.,\r\nin his work on the Antiquities of Worcestershire, now in the press.\r\n\r\n[988] We extract the following notice on this passage from Humboldt\r\n(Cosmos, vol. iii. 54, Bohn’s edition). “This passage has recently been\r\npronounced corrupt, (Kramer i. 211,) and δι’ ὑάλων (through glass\r\nspheres) substituted for δι’ αὐλῶν (Schneider, Eclog. Phys. ii. 273).\r\nThe magnifying power of hollow glass spheres, filled with water, (Seneca\r\ni. 6,) was, indeed, as familiar to the ancients as the action of burning\r\nglasses or crystals, (Aristoph. Nub. v. 765,) and that of Nero’s emerald\r\n(Plin. xxxvii. 5); but these spheres most assuredly could not have been\r\nemployed as astronomical measuring instruments. (Compare Cosmos i. p.\r\n619.) Solar altitudes taken through thin light clouds, or through\r\nvolcanic vapours, exhibit no trace of the influence of refraction.”\r\n\r\n[989] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[990] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[991] Ἄνας.\r\n\r\n[992] The Tagus, the Guadiana, and the Guadalquiver, pursue a course\r\nnearly parallel to each other, and all incline towards the south before\r\ndischarging themselves into the sea; the inclination of the Tagus is not\r\nequal to that of the other rivers.\r\n\r\n[993] Lusitania occupied the greater part of the present kingdom of\r\nPortugal. It was from the countries north of the Tagus that the Romans\r\ncaused certain of the inhabitants to emigrate to the south side of that\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n[994] The Carpetani occupied a portion of New Castile, where the cities\r\nof Madrid, Toledo, &c. are now situated.\r\n\r\n[995] These people inhabited the southern portions of New Castile, now\r\noccupied by the cities of Calatrava, Ciudad-real, Alcaraz, &c. They also\r\npossessed a part of the Sierra-Morena.\r\n\r\n[996] The Vettones inhabited that part of Estremadura, where the cities\r\nof Alcantara, Truxillo, &c. are now situated.\r\n\r\n[997] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[998] Anas.\r\n\r\n[999] The course of the Guadiana is longer than that of the\r\nGuadalquiver.\r\n\r\n[1000] Viz. Turdetania.\r\n\r\n[1001] The mountainous country in which the Guadalquiver takes its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n[1002] The rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1003] This Timosthenes was the admiral of Ptolemy II. Strabo mentions\r\nhim repeatedly.\r\n\r\n[1004] The place on which this town formerly stood is now designated\r\n_Val de Vacca_.\r\n\r\n[1005] Rio Barbate.\r\n\r\n[1006] Now Azzila.\r\n\r\n[1007] Called by Pliny and Ptolemy _Julia Transducta_. It appears to\r\nhave been situated at the western entrance of the Bay of Gibraltar, at\r\nthe place now called Al-Gesira.\r\n\r\n[1008] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1009] An Athenian king, who led the Athenians against Troy. The port of\r\nMenestheus is now Puerto Sta. Maria.\r\n\r\n[1010] _Hodie_ Lebrixa.\r\n\r\n[1011] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1012] At or near the port of Menestheus, just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1013] Quintus Servilius Cæpio, a famous Roman general. Vide lib. iv. c.\r\ni. § 13.\r\n\r\n[1014] This city is not to be confounded with others of the same name in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[1015] Strabo is the only writer who speaks of this temple of\r\nPhosphorus. It was no doubt a temple to Diana, who was named Ἄρτεμις\r\nΦωσφόρος. This temple, according to the Spanish authors quoted by Lopez\r\nin his translation of Strabo, corresponds to the present San-Lucar de\r\nBarrameda.\r\n\r\n[1016] Strabo here gives the Latin _Lucem dubiam_ in Greek characters,\r\nΛοῦκεμ δουβίαν.\r\n\r\n[1017] The Guadiana at the present day has but one mouth.\r\n\r\n[1018] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1019] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1020] Anas.\r\n\r\n[1021] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1022] Cordova, situated on the Guadalquiver in Andalusia. We do not\r\nknow whether it were founded by the Marcellus who was prætor in Thither\r\nIberia, and created consul in the year of Rome 601, or Marcellus who\r\njoined Pompey’s party against Cæsar. This city served for the winter\r\nquarters of the Romans, who during summer made war on the inhabitants of\r\nthe western and northern parts of Spain. It was the native place of the\r\ntwo Senecas and Lucan, and the chief emporium of Iberia. We may form\r\nsome idea of the amount of its population from the number of those who\r\nperished when taken by Cæsar, as narrated by Hirtius, Spanish War, § 34.\r\nBut the period in which Cordova’s glory was at its zenith was during the\r\nempire of the Moors, in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, when it\r\nnumbered 300,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[1023] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1024] Seville. This city was surnamed Julia Romulensis. It was founded\r\nby Cæsar, and regarded as the second city of the province, although, as\r\nwe see, in the time of Strabo it was only third-rate.\r\n\r\n[1025] Strabo is the only writer who mentions this city of Bætis.\r\nCasaubon and others are inclined to the opinion that the MSS. are\r\ncorrupted, and that formerly another name stood here.\r\n\r\n[1026] This city, the native place of the emperors Trajan and Adrian,\r\nand the poet Silius Italicus, was founded by Publius Scipio in the\r\nsecond Punic war, who placed here the soldiers incapacitated from the\r\nperformance of military service. It is supposed to correspond to Sevilla\r\nla Vieja, about a league distant from Seville.\r\n\r\n[1027] The Ilipa Ilia of Pliny and Illipula Magna of Ptolemy. Its exact\r\nposition is not determined.\r\n\r\n[1028] _Hodie_ Ecija on the Xenil.\r\n\r\n[1029] Carmona.\r\n\r\n[1030] Monda, seven leagues west of Malaga.\r\n\r\n[1031] Osuna.\r\n\r\n[1032] _Hodie_ Martos, Pliny gave it the surname of Augusta Gemella.\r\n\r\n[1033] The Itucci of Pliny, to which he gives the surname Virtus Julia.\r\n\r\n[1034] We should probably read 430.\r\n\r\n[1035] Kramer, using the criticism of Lachmann, observes that this is a\r\nmisreading for Midaium, and that a like mistake occurs in Appian.\r\n\r\n[1036] Furnius and Titius.\r\n\r\n[1037] In Lusitania.\r\n\r\n[1038] About the spot where this city is supposed to have stood, between\r\nXerez and Tribugena, there is still a place called Mesa de Asta.\r\n\r\n[1039] Strabo uses ὁλκάσιν ἀξιολόγοις, but the English hulk would not\r\nbear the same import in this place as the Greek.\r\n\r\n[1040] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1041] Cotillas, or perhaps Constantina near Almaden.\r\n\r\n[1042] Anas.\r\n\r\n[1043] Experience does not seem to warrant this conclusion.\r\n\r\n[1044] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1045] Of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1046] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1047] The text here is evidently corrupt, but it is not easy to\r\ndetermine to what extent the overflow reached at the time Strabo wrote.\r\n\r\n[1048] Lebrixa.\r\n\r\n[1049] Gibraleon.\r\n\r\n[1050] Spain.\r\n\r\n[1051] οἱ Εὖροι.\r\n\r\n[1052] Majorca and Minorca.\r\n\r\n[1053] In his third book, Strabo, speaking of Campania, regards the oil\r\nof Venafrum as superior to any other. In this he agrees with Pliny, who\r\nplaces in the second class the oils of Bætica and Istria. Pausanias\r\nconsiders these two oils, both for beauty of colour and excellence of\r\nflavour, inferior to that produced at Tithorea in Phocis, and which was\r\nsent to Rome for the service of the emperor’s table.\r\n\r\n[1054] _Coccus tinctorius_, used to dye scarlet.\r\n\r\n[1055] Sinop, still a Turkish city of importance.\r\n\r\n[1056] A people inhabiting the western parts of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n[1057] This name occurs only in Strabo: of the various conjectures which\r\nhave been hazarded on the subject, one of the most probable seems to be\r\nthat we should read Saltigetæ, a people of Bastetania, mentioned by\r\nPtolemy.\r\n\r\n[1058] These were evidently rabbits.\r\n\r\n[1059] Spain.\r\n\r\n[1060] Majorca and Minorca.\r\n\r\n[1061] According to Pliny, (lib. viii. c. 55,) this deputation was sent\r\nto Augustus to demand of him a military force, apparently for the\r\npurpose of assisting the inhabitants in destroying the rabbits. The same\r\nwriter has brought together a variety of instances in which cities have\r\nbeen abandoned or destroyed through similar causes. Vide lib. viii. c.\r\n29. The inhabitants of Abdera in Thrace were forced to quit their city\r\non account of the rats and frogs, and settled on the frontiers of\r\nMacedonia. (Justin. lib. xv. c. 2.)\r\n\r\n[1062] Ferrets.\r\n\r\n[1063] Pozzuolo.\r\n\r\n[1064] We have here followed Gosselin’s suggestion of λιμνασίαν instead\r\nof γυμνασίαν, the reading of MSS.\r\n\r\n[1065] A kind of whale, mentioned also by Aristotle, but which does not\r\nseem to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[1066] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1067] A kind of shell-fish with a wreathed shell, which might be used\r\nas a sort of trumpet. It is mentioned by Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[1068] The cotyla held about three-fourths of a pint.\r\n\r\n[1069] This weight equalled 15 oz. 83¾ grs.\r\n\r\n[1070] The Euboic or Attic talent, which is here meant, equalled almost\r\n57 lb.\r\n\r\n[1071] A kind of cuttle-fish or squid.\r\n\r\n[1072] Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[1073] Turdetania.\r\n\r\n[1074] The mineral riches of Spain are lauded in equal terms by\r\nHerodotus, Aristotle, Pliny, and many other writers. We can only remark,\r\nthat at the present day the mineral wealth of that country scarcely\r\njustifies such descriptions.\r\n\r\n[1075] The Cevennes.\r\n\r\n[1076] Pliny, (lib. xxxiii. c. 4,) writing on the same subject, says,\r\n“Inveniuntur ita massæ; necnon in puteis etiam _denas_ excedentes\r\nlibras. _Palacras_ Hispani, alii _palacranas_, iidem quod minutum est\r\n_balucem_ vocant.”\r\n\r\n[1077] This passage is evidently corrupt, nor do any of the readings\r\nwhich have been proposed seem to clear up the difficulties which it\r\npresents.\r\n\r\n[1078] Archimedes’ Screw. It was called the Egyptian screw because\r\ninvented by Archimedes when in Egypt, and also because it was much\r\nemployed by the Egyptians in raising water from the Nile for the\r\nirrigation of their lands.\r\n\r\n[1079] We read τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν, according to Kramer’s suggestion.\r\n\r\n[1080] The following is the enigma alluded to. We have extracted it from\r\nMackenzie’s Translation of the Life of Homer, attributed to Herodotus of\r\nHalicarnassius. While the sailors and the towns-people of the Isle of Ios\r\n(Nio) were speaking with Homer, some fishermen’s children ran their\r\nvessel on shore, and descending to the sands, addressed these words to\r\nthe assembled persons: “Hear us, strangers, explain our riddle if ye\r\ncan.” Then some of those who were present ordered them to speak. “We\r\nleave,” say they, “what we take, and we carry with us that we cannot\r\ntake.” No one being able to solve the enigma, they thus expounded it.\r\n“Having had an unproductive fishery,” say they in explanation, “we sat\r\ndown on the sand, and being annoyed by the vermin, left the fish we had\r\ntaken on the shore, taking with us the vermin we could not catch.”\r\n\r\n[1081] These people inhabited the province of Gallicia in Spain.\r\n\r\n[1082] Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1083] Caslona.\r\n\r\n[1084] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1085] The Sierra Cazorla.\r\n\r\n[1086] Anas.\r\n\r\n[1087] These 900 stadia are equal to from 25 to 26 leagues, which is\r\nexactly the distance from the sources of the Guadalquiver near to\r\nCazorla to the lagoons named Ojos de Guadiana, adjacent to Villa-Harta.\r\n\r\n[1088] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1089] A Greek poet born at Himera in Sicily, and who flourished about\r\nB. C. 570: he lived in the time of Phalaris, and was contemporary with\r\nSappho, Alcæus, and Pittacus.\r\n\r\n[1090] The rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1091] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1092] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1093] This is exactly the distance from Cadiz to Cape St. Vincent,\r\nfollowing the coasts. It is from 48 to 49 leagues.\r\n\r\n[1094] Gaul.\r\n\r\n[1095] The bright light of the sun fell into the ocean, drawing dark\r\nnight over the fruitful earth. Iliad viii. 485.\r\n\r\n[1096] Wandering rocks.\r\n\r\n[1097] Entwining or conflicting rocks. Euripides, Medea, verse 2, gives\r\nthem the title of Symplegades.\r\n\r\n[1098] Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1099] The Strait of Messina.\r\n\r\n[1100] Ulisipo or Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[1101] A proverbial expression by which the Greeks described a victory\r\nequally prejudicial to the victors and the vanquished.\r\n\r\n[1102] But still it would be disgraceful to remain here so long, and to\r\nreturn home without fitting booty. Iliad ii. 298.\r\n\r\n[1103] We should probably here read Menestheus.\r\n\r\n[1104] But the immortals will send you to the Elysian plain, and the\r\nboundaries of the earth, where is auburn-haired Rhadamanthus; there of a\r\ntruth is the most easy life for men. There is nor snow nor long winter,\r\nnor ever a shower, but ever does the ocean send forth the gently blowing\r\nbreezes of the west wind to refresh men. Odyssey iv. 563.\r\n\r\n[1105] There then I beheld Minos, the illustrious son of Jove, having a\r\ngolden sceptre, giving laws to the dead. Odyssey xi. 567. Bohn’s\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[1106] The Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n[1107] Hamilcar, the father of Hannibal.\r\n\r\n[1108] We have preferred, in common with the French translation, and the\r\nmanuscript cited by Xylander, to read φιάλαις, instead of φάτναις,\r\nthinking it probable that Strabo referred in the first instance to the\r\ndrinking vessels, and afterwards to the wine barrels, as being made of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n[1109] Herodotus, who wrote about a century after the time of Anacreon,\r\nexpressly tells us that Arganthonius reigned during eighty years, and\r\nlived one hundred and twenty (l. i. c. 163). Cicero, Valerius Maximus,\r\nand Pliny report the same, apparently on the testimony of Herodotus.\r\nLucian, Phlegon, and Appian however state the life of Arganthonius at\r\none hundred and fifty years; and what is remarkable, the two former,\r\nLucian and Phlegon, cite as their authority Anacreon and Herodotus.\r\nPliny, citing Anacreon, has taken the _reign_ of one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, mentioned by the poet, as a _life_ of that duration. The passage\r\nof Strabo is evidently changed from its original form.\r\n\r\n[1110] Of the number are Pomponius Mela and Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1111] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1112] That is, been admitted to all the privileges of Roman\r\ncitizenship. Pliny tells us that in Bætica alone there were thirty\r\ncities enjoying this distinction.\r\n\r\n[1113] Beja in Alentejo: others, with less show of probability, say\r\nBadajoz the capital of Estremadura.\r\n\r\n[1114] Merida.\r\n\r\n[1115] Saragossa.\r\n\r\n[1116] Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1117] Cape Espichel.\r\n\r\n[1118] Coray reads two hundred and ten stadia, Groskurd and the French\r\ntranslators adopt 200; but the whole passage is so manifestly corrupt,\r\nthat it scarcely seemed safe to hazard the correction.\r\n\r\n[1119] The text is here very corrupt, and the explanations of the\r\neditors and translators unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[1120] A city of Lusitania, _hod._ Al-Merim.\r\n\r\n[1121] Literally towards the sunset at the equinox.\r\n\r\n[1122] Anas.\r\n\r\n[1123] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1124] Durius.\r\n\r\n[1125] This city is not mentioned elsewhere in Strabo.\r\n\r\n[1126] Caslona.\r\n\r\n[1127] Oreto.\r\n\r\n[1128] μυρίων καὶ τρισχιλίων, in text, but plainly the result of some\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n[1129] We have followed the suggestion of Kramer in the rendering of\r\nthis passage, the Greek text being evidently corrupt.\r\n\r\n[1130] Munda.\r\n\r\n[1131] Vacua.\r\n\r\n[1132] Durius.\r\n\r\n[1133] A city situated near Soria in Old Castile.\r\n\r\n[1134] Now the Lima.\r\n\r\n[1135] Xylander and many of the commentators propose to read Ὀβλιουιῶνα,\r\nor Oblivion, in place of Βελιῶνα. The conjecture seems extremely\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n[1136] The Minho of the present day.\r\n\r\n[1137] The Minho is far surpassed in size, both by the Duero and the\r\nTagus.\r\n\r\n[1138] The text here is evidently incorrect. In the first place, the καὶ\r\nαὐτὸν, which we have rendered _this too_, evidently sustained some\r\nrelation, no longer subsisting, to what preceded; and in the second, the\r\nsources of the Minho were not in Cantabria, but Gallicia.\r\n\r\n[1139] Strabo here appears to confound the mouth of the Minho with a\r\nsmall bay about five leagues distant, near to the city of Bayona in\r\nGallicia, and before which there is still the small island of Bayona.\r\n\r\n[1140] Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[1141] Anas.\r\n\r\n[1142] Limæa.\r\n\r\n[1143] Or the river of Oblivion, apparently because they forgot to\r\nreturn to their own country.\r\n\r\n[1144] A few of the MSS. read fifty, which number seems to be\r\ncountenanced by the statement of Pliny, that forty-six nations inhabited\r\nLusitania: but then the limits he set to the country were more extended\r\nthan those allowed by Strabo.\r\n\r\n[1145] The κούφος of the text signifies also a volatile disposition.\r\n\r\n[1146] Some part of the sentence seems here to be wanting. It probably\r\ncontained a description of the kind of sword made use of.\r\n\r\n[1147] Durius.\r\n\r\n[1148] This reminds one of the _glibs_ the Irish used to wear down to a\r\nrecent period.\r\n\r\n[1149] This passage is not found in any of the odes of Pindar now\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n[1150] The French translators observe, that we should probably\r\nunderstand this passage as follows, They exercise themselves as\r\nlight-armed infantry, heavy-armed infantry, cavalry, &c.\r\n\r\n[1151] Xenophon describes this, or one very similar, as the Persian\r\ndance: Τέλος δὲ τὸ Περσικὸν ὠρχεῖτο, κροτῶν τὰς πέλτας· καὶ ὤκλαζε, καὶ\r\nἐξανίστατο. “Last of all he danced the Persian dance, clashing his\r\nbucklers, and in dancing fell on his knees, then sprang up again.” Xen.\r\nAnab. b. vi. c. 1, 10.\r\n\r\n[1152] This is said to distinguish them from their neighbours, the\r\ninhabitants of Majorca and Minorca, whose peculiar marriage ceremonies\r\nare thus described by Diodorus Siculus, lib. v. c. 18: Παράδοξον δέ τι\r\nκαὶ κατὰ τοὺς γάμους νόμιμον παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἐστιν· ἐν γὰρ ταῖς κατὰ τοὺς\r\nγάμους εὐωχίαις, οἰκείων τε καὶ φίλων κατὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν ὁ πρῶτος ἀεὶ καὶ\r\nὁ δεύτερος, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ κατὰ τὸ ἑξῆς, μίσγονται ταῖς νύμφαις ἀνὰ\r\nμέρος, ἐσχάτου τοῦ νυμφίου τυγχάνοντος ταύτης τῆς τιμῆς.\r\n\r\n[1153] The mention of Egyptians here seems surprising, inasmuch as no\r\nwriter appears to have recorded this as one of their customs. Of the\r\nAssyrians it is stated, both by Herodotus, i. 197, and also by Strabo\r\nhimself, xvi. cap. i. 746. It seems therefore most probable that\r\nAssyrians are intended, Egyptians being merely an error of the\r\ntranscriber.\r\n\r\n[1154] Inhabitants of Biscay.\r\n\r\n[1155] People of Navarre.\r\n\r\n[1156] Who the Pleutauri were, we do not know. The Bardyetæ appear to be\r\nthe same people whom Strabo afterwards speaks of as Bardyiti, or\r\nBardyali, who occupied a narrow slip of land between the east of Alava\r\nand the west of Navarre. The Allotriges Casaubon supposes to be the same\r\nas the Autrigones, who occupied the coast from Laredo to the Gulf of\r\nBilboa.\r\n\r\n[1157] Inhabitants of Biscay.\r\n\r\n[1158] Iberus.\r\n\r\n[1159] πλὴν Τουίσοι: these words are manifestly corrupt, but none of the\r\nvarious conjectural readings seem at all probable.\r\n\r\n[1160] From the Pillars to the Sacred Promontory, or Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[1161] The rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1162] Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1163] Viz. from Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1164] Malaga.\r\n\r\n[1165] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1166] Pomponius Mela gives this city the name of Hexi, or Ex, according\r\nto another reading; Pliny names it Sexi, with the surname of Firmum\r\nJulium; and Ptolemy, Sex. This is merely a difference relative to the\r\naspiration of the word, which was sometimes omitted, at other times\r\nexpressed by the letters H or S indifferently.\r\n\r\n[1167] Mentioned by Pliny, Athenæus, Galen, and also by Martial, lib.\r\nvii. Epigramm. 78,\r\n\r\n   Cum Saxetani ponatur cauda lacerti;\r\n     Et bene si cœnas, conchis inuncta tibi est;\r\n   Sumen, aprum, leporem, boletos, ostrea, mullos,\r\n     Mittis: habes nec cor, Papile, nec genium.\r\n\r\n[1168] Adra.\r\n\r\n[1169] Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[1170] Asclepiades of Myrlea, a city of Bithynia, was a grammarian, and\r\ndisciple of the celebrated grammarian, Apollonius. According to Suidas\r\nhe taught literature at Rome, under Pompey the Great. And it is probable\r\nthat it was with Pompey he afterwards passed into Spain.\r\n\r\n[1171] Teucer, the son of Telamon, king of the island of Salamis, being\r\ndriven out of the country by his father, founded in Cyprus the city of\r\nSalamis. Justin adds, that after the death of his father he returned to\r\nthe island of Salamis; but being prevented by the son of Ajax, his\r\nbrother, from debarking, he went into Iberia, and took up his abode on\r\nthe spot where Carthagena was afterwards built: that subsequently he\r\nremoved into the country of the Gallicians, and settled amongst them.\r\n\r\n[1172] The Hellenes derived their name from Hellen the son of Deucalion\r\nand Pyrrha. This name, which at first designated only a small people of\r\nThessaly, became afterwards the general appellation of the inhabitants\r\nof the whole of Greece.\r\n\r\n[1173] Amphilochus, on his return from Troy, founded with Mopsus the\r\ncity of Mallos in Cilicia. He afterwards retired to Argos, but not being\r\ncontented there he rejoined Mopsus, who however would no longer divide\r\nwith him the government of their common colony. This dispute resulted in\r\na remarkable combat, which cost the life of both. (Compare Strabo. l.\r\nxiv. c. 4.) Sophocles and other tragic poets have taken advantage of\r\nthis tradition. Herodotus likewise speaks of the voyages of Amphilochus\r\ninto Cilicia, and of the city of Posideium which he founded there, but\r\nhe tells us nothing of his death. Thucydides merely says that\r\nAmphilochus on his return home after the Trojan war, being discontented\r\nwith his compatriots, founded in the Gulf of Ambracia a city which he\r\nnamed after his fatherland, Argos. None of these traditions mention a\r\nvoyage to Iberia.\r\n\r\n[1174] Siebenkees suspects that this name should be read Ocella. The\r\nOcelenses in Lusitania are commended by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1175] Some MSS. read Opsicella.\r\n\r\n[1176] Strabo, or rather Artemidorus, seems to have confused the two\r\nkinds of lotus mentioned by the ancients. That whereof they ate the\r\nroots and the grain is the lotus of the Nile, and a plant of the species\r\n_nymphæa_. The lotus alluded to in this instance is a shrub, (the\r\n_rhamnus lotus_ of Linnæus,) named _seedra_ by the inhabitants of\r\nBarbary, with whom the fruit is an article of food. Herodotus mentions\r\nboth kinds, (lib. ii. c. 92, and iv. c. 177,) and Polybius describes the\r\nsecond, as an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n[1177] The Island of Zerbi.\r\n\r\n[1178] The Gulf of Cabes.\r\n\r\n[1179] A celebrated stoic philosopher and grammarian contemporary with\r\nAristarchus. He was of Mallos, a city of Cilicia, and surnamed the\r\nCritic and the Homeric, on account of the corrections, explanations, and\r\nremarks which he composed in nine books on the poems of Homer.\r\n\r\n[1180] Sertorius, on the return of Sylla to Rome, took refuge in Spain,\r\nwhere he put himself at the head of the Romans who had revolted against\r\nthe republic; he was assassinated by one of his officers.\r\n\r\n[1181] Adra.\r\n\r\n[1182] Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1183] Sucro.\r\n\r\n[1184] That is, the ancient name, Sucro.\r\n\r\n[1185] Malaga.\r\n\r\n[1186] Denia or Artemus.\r\n\r\n[1187] Denia.\r\n\r\n[1188] Isola Plana.\r\n\r\n[1189] S. Pola.\r\n\r\n[1190] Islote.\r\n\r\n[1191] A sauce so named from the _garus_, a small fish, from which\r\noriginally it was prepared. Afterwards it was made with mackerel and\r\nother fish. Vide Pliny l. xxxi. c. 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[1192] Peniscola.\r\n\r\n[1193] Tortosa.\r\n\r\n[1194] Tarragona.\r\n\r\n[1195] New Carthage, or Carthagena, is intended.\r\n\r\n[1196] Sent from Rome.\r\n\r\n[1197] Majorca and Minorca.\r\n\r\n[1198] Iviça.\r\n\r\n[1199] Ampurias.\r\n\r\n[1200] The text is here manifestly corrupt. Various other numbers, from\r\n4 to 400, have been conjectured as the true reading. Gosselin and\r\nGroskurd are in favour of 200.\r\n\r\n[1201] Sic text. Siebenkees and Coray propose to read Ῥόδος, and\r\nCasaubon also Ῥόδη, now Rosas.\r\n\r\n[1202] Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[1203] Probably the river Fluvia, the Alba of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[1204] Iberia, or Spain, was anciently divided into two grand divisions,\r\nto which the Romans gave the names of _Citerior_ and _Ulterior_ Iberia.\r\nAugustus subdivided this latter into the two provinces of Bætica and\r\nLusitania, giving the name of Tarraco to Citerior Iberia. Nevertheless\r\nthe ancient names of Citerior and Ulterior continued in use long after\r\nthis division.\r\n\r\n[1205] Tarragona.\r\n\r\n[1206] We are not exactly acquainted with this place, it is probably\r\nVidreras; though others suppose it to be Colonia Sagerra.\r\n\r\n[1207] Tortosa.\r\n\r\n[1208] Murviedro.\r\n\r\n[1209] Xativa.\r\n\r\n[1210] The cordage of the famous vessel built by Hiero of Syracuse was\r\nformed from the spartum of Iberia.

We have adopted the\r\nLatin divus as the most suitable epithet for the emperor in an English\r\nversion.\r\n\r\n[1229] Gosselin here labours to reconcile these distances with the\r\nactual topography of those parts, but it is useless to attempt to make\r\nall the loose statements furnished by Strabo tally with the exact\r\ndistances of the places he mentions by supposing the stadia to be so\r\ncontinually varied.\r\n\r\n[1230] Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n[1231] Gosselin is of opinion that this Œaso, is not Ojarço near\r\nFontarabia, but thinks it probable that Ea near Cape Machicaco is the\r\nsite where it stood.\r\n\r\n[1232] People of Biscay.\r\n\r\n[1233] The ancient Anas.\r\n\r\n[1234] The ruins of Numantia are seen a little to the north of Soria.\r\n\r\n[1235] Bætis.\r\n\r\n[1236] Probably the small village of Varea, about half a league from\r\nLogroño; D’Anville supposes it to be Logroño itself.\r\n\r\n[1237] _Aliter_ Bardyali.\r\n\r\n[1238] Kramer has altered the text into Ἐδητανῶν, all MSS. having\r\nδιττανῶν. There is little doubt they are the same people mentioned in\r\nsection 14 as Sidetani.\r\n\r\n[1239] Palencia.\r\n\r\n[1240] Saragossa.\r\n\r\n[1241] Baubola.\r\n\r\n[1242] Sasamo, west of Briviesca.\r\n\r\n[1243] Allusion is here made to the custom of the Roman generals, who\r\ncaused to be carried at their triumphs, representations in painting or\r\nsculpture, not only of the kings or generals of the enemy, who had been\r\nslain, but likewise of the forts, cities, mountains, lakes, rivers, and\r\neven seas, conquered from the enemy. This usage explains the words of\r\nCicero, “portari in triumpho Massiliam vidimus.” Appian, on occasion of\r\nthe triumph of Scipio, says, Πύργοι τε παραφέρονται μιμήματα τῶν\r\nεἰλημμένων πόλεων.\r\n\r\n[1244] Sucro, _now_ Xucar.\r\n\r\n[1245] The same people as the Edetani, mentioned in section 12.\r\n\r\n[1246] Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1247] Malaga.\r\n\r\n[1248] At the present day the best castor comes from Russia, but the\r\ngreater part of that found in shops is the produce of Canada. It is\r\ndenominated a stimulant and antispasmodic. Formerly it was much used in\r\nspasmodic diseases, as hysteria and epilepsy. It is now considered\r\nalmost inert, and is seldom employed. After this description, it is\r\nscarcely necessary to warn the reader against the vulgar error of\r\nconfusing castor with castor oil, which is extracted from the seeds of\r\nthe Ricinus communis or castor oil plant, a shrub growing in the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\n[1249] Apuleius, Catullus, and Diodorus Siculus all speak of this\r\nsingular custom.\r\n\r\n[1250] A note in the French edition says, “This surprise of the Vettones\r\nis nothing extraordinary. Amongst all barbarous nations, savages\r\nespecially, the promenade is an unknown exercise. When roused by\r\nnecessity or passion, they will even kill themselves with fatigue; at\r\nother times they remain in the most perfect inaction. The first thing\r\nwhich strikes a Turk on coming to any of the polished nations of Europe,\r\nis to see men promenading without any other aim but that of pleasure or\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\n[1251] Head-dress shaped like a drum.\r\n\r\n[1252] At the present day in Bilboa, the capital of Biscay, the women\r\nwork far more than the men; they load and unload vessels, and carry on\r\ntheir heads burdens which require two men to place there.\r\n\r\n[1253] We must remark that so far from the dowry given by men to their\r\nwives being an evidence of civilization, it is a custom common amongst\r\nbarbarous people, and indicative of nothing so much as the despotic\r\npower of the man over the wife. These dowries were generally a sum of\r\nmoney from the husband to the father of his intended, on the payment of\r\nwhich he acquired the same power over her as over a slave. Aristotle,\r\nspeaking of the ancient Greeks, tells us expressly that they bought\r\ntheir wives, (Polit. ii. c. 8,) and observing that amongst barbarous\r\nnations women were always regarded in the same light as slaves, he cites\r\nthe example of the Cyclopes, who exercised, according to Homer,\r\nsovereign authority over their families (Odyss. l. ix. 114). This custom\r\nwas so well established amongst the Greeks at the time of the poet, that\r\nhe does not hesitate to introduce it amongst the gods (Odyss. viii.\r\n318). It was not unknown among the Jews, and Strabo, in his fifteenth\r\nbook, tells us that the Indians bought their wives.\r\n\r\n[1254] Cæsar and Athenæus attribute this custom to the Gauls, and\r\nValerius Maximus to the Keltiberians. Those men who attached themselves\r\nto the interests of any prince or famous personage, and who espoused all\r\nhis quarrels, even devoting themselves to death on his account, are\r\nnamed by Athenæus σιλοδοῦροι, and by Cæsar _soldurii_. Speaking of 600\r\nsoldiers devoted in this manner to a Gaulish prince, named Adcantuannus,\r\nCæsar (l. iii. c. 22) says, “Sibi mortem consciscant; neque adhuc\r\nhominum memoriâ repertus est quisquam, qui, eo interfecto cujus se\r\namicitiæ devovisset, mori recusaret.” Plutarch tells us that Sertorius\r\nhad in his suite many thousand Iberians devoted to him. The following\r\nepitaph of these men, who, after the death of Sertorius, sacrificed\r\nthemselves, being unwilling to survive him, was extracted by Swinburne\r\nfrom the Annals of Catalonia.\r\n\r\n   Hic multæ quæ se manibus\r\n   Q. Sertorii turmæ, et terræ\r\n   Mortalium omnium parenti\r\n   Devovere, dum, eo sublato,\r\n   Superesse tæderet, et fortiter\r\n   Pugnando invicem cecidere,\r\n   Morte ad præsens optata jacent.\r\n         Valete posteri.\r\n\r\nFor the appalling means they adopted to hold out the city of Calaguris\r\nto the last, see Valerius Maximus, lib. vii. cap. vi.\r\n\r\n[1255] The country between the Ebro and the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[1256] These Igletes are the same which Stephen of Byzantium names\r\nGletes, and by an error of the copyist Tletes. Herodotus places them\r\nbetween the Cynetæ, and the Tartessians, and Theopompus in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Tartessians. The position between the Ebro and the\r\nPyrenees, which Asclepiades the Myrlean thus gives them, supports the\r\nopinion of those who reckon that Rosas was founded by the Rhodians, and\r\nthat the people of Marseilles did not settle there till afterwards; it\r\nis more than probable that the Igletes were nothing more than Ignetes or\r\nGnetes of the Isle of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[1257] Caslona.\r\n\r\n[1258] Merida.\r\n\r\n[1259] Casaubon supposes that this is the river Ptolemy names Merus.\r\nLopez, Geograf. de Estrabon, lib. iii. p. 232, thinks it the Narcea.\r\n\r\n[1260] Pomponius Mela and Pliny coincide with Strabo in making this city\r\nbelong to the Asturians; Ptolemy however describes it under the name of\r\nNoega Ucesia as pertaining to the Cantabrians. Some say it corresponds\r\nto the present Navia, others to Pravia. Groskurd reckons it Gajon, or\r\nNavia, or Santander.\r\n\r\n[1261] Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[1262] Tarragona.\r\n\r\n[1263] Murviedro.\r\n\r\n[1264] Iviça\r\n\r\n[1265] Majorca.\r\n\r\n[1266] Palma.\r\n\r\n[1267] Pollerça.\r\n\r\n[1268] Gosselin observes that the greatest length of Majorca is 14\r\nleagues and a half; its breadth at the narrowest part 8 leagues; and\r\nadds, that by confounding stadia of unequal value, Strabo makes Majorca\r\na long narrow island, whereas in fact its form approaches nearer to that\r\nof a square.\r\n\r\n[1269] Minorca.\r\n\r\n[1270] Viz. the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n[1271] Immediately after the word μελαγκραΐνας, which we have translated\r\nblack rush, the text of our geographer runs on as follows: “resembling\r\nthe schœnus, a species of rush from which cords are made. Philetas in\r\nhis Mercury [says] ‘he was covered with a vile and filthy tunic, and\r\nabout his wretched loins was bound a strip of black rush, as if he had\r\nbeen girt with a mere schœnus.’” It is evident that this passage is the\r\nscholium of some ancient grammarian, and we have followed the example of\r\nthe French editors in inserting it in a note, as it is a great\r\nimpediment in the middle of Strabo’s description of the equipment of the\r\nisland warriors.\r\n\r\n[1272] “Cibum puer a matre non accipit, nisi quem, ipsa monstrante,\r\npercussit.” Florus, lib. iii. c. 8. The same thing is stated by\r\nLycophron, v. 637, and Diodorus Siculus, l. v. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[1273] Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[1274] The rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1275] This mouth of the Guadalquiver, opposite Cadiz, no longer exists.\r\n\r\n[1276] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1277] Padua.\r\n\r\n[1278] “The length of the island of Leon, at the extremity of which the\r\ncity of Cadiz is situated, is about 9500 toises, which are equivalent to\r\n100 Olympic stadia.” _Gosselin._\r\n\r\n[1279] L. Cornelius Balbus was a native of Cadiz, and descended from an\r\nillustrious family in that town. His original name probably bore some\r\nresemblance in sound to the Latin Balbus. Cadiz being one of the\r\nfederate cities, supported the Romans in their war against Sertorius in\r\nSpain, and Balbus thus had an opportunity for distinguishing himself. He\r\nserved under the Roman generals Q. Mettellus Pius, C. Memmius, and\r\nPompey, and was present at the battles of Turia and Sucro. He\r\ndistinguished himself so much throughout the war, that Pompey conferred\r\nthe Roman citizenship upon him, his brother, and his brother’s sons and\r\nthis act of Pompey was ratified by the law of the consuls, Cn. Cornelius\r\nLentulus and L. Gellius, B. C. 72. It was probably in honour of these\r\nconsuls that Balbus took the Gentile name of the one, and the prænomen\r\nof the other. It was for this Balbus that Cicero made the defence which\r\nhas come down to us. The reason which induced Strabo to notice, as\r\nsomething remarkable, that Balbus had received the honours of a triumph,\r\nwe learn from Pliny, who, noticing the victories which he had gained\r\nover the Garamantes and other nations of Africa, tells us he was the\r\nonly person of foreign extraction who had ever received the honour of a\r\ntriumph. “Omnia armis Romanis superata et a Cornelio Balbo triumphata,\r\nuni huic omnium externo curru et Quiritium jure donato.” Plin. lib. v.\r\nc. 5. Solinus likewise says of him, (cap. xxix. p. 54.) “Primus sane de\r\nexternis, utpote Gadibus genitus accessit ad gloriam nominis\r\ntriumphalis.”\r\n\r\n[1280] This word signifies “The Twins.”\r\n\r\n[1281] Gosselin says, the temple of Saturn appears to have stood on the\r\nsite of the present church of S. Sebastian, and that of Hercules at the\r\nother extremity of the island on the site of St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\n[1282] Groskurd supposes that we should here read, “[certain citizens of\r\nCadiz have appropriated to themselves possessions in the interior of the\r\nisland,] but the whole sea-shore is inhabited in common,” that is, by\r\nshepherds who pastured the grounds in common.\r\n\r\n[1283] Gosselin shows that we ought to read 500 stadia in this place.\r\n\r\n[1284] The rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[1285] The Ape-mountain near Ceuta.\r\n\r\n[1286] The text is corrupt, but it is needless to go through all the\r\nemendations proposed.\r\n\r\n[1287] This passage of Pindar has not come down to us.\r\n\r\n[1288] ψεῦσμα Φοινικικόν, a proverbial mode of speaking, having its\r\norigin in the bad faith of the Phœnicians [_fides Punica_].\r\n\r\n[1289] Regio.\r\n\r\n[1290] Strabo, in his 17th book, gives a different locality to these\r\naltars.\r\n\r\n[1291] These were twelve altars, of fifty cubits each, erected to the\r\ntwelve gods. _Vide_ Diodorus Siculus, l. XVII. c. 95.\r\n\r\n[1292] The text is ἐν τοῖς παραδόξοις, which Gosselin renders, “Les\r\nouvrages qui traitent des choses merveilleuses.”\r\n\r\n[1293] Strabo’s argument is here so weak, that one can hardly believe it\r\ncan have ever been seriously made use of.\r\n\r\n[1294] This method of explaining the ebb and flow of the sea, by\r\ncomparing it to the respiration of animals, is not so extraordinary,\r\nwhen we remember that it was the opinion of many philosophers that the\r\nuniverse was itself an animal. Pomponius Mela, (De Situ Orbis, lib. iii.\r\nc. 1,) speaking of the tides, says, “Neque adhuc satis cognitum est,\r\nanhelitune suo id mundus efficiat, retractamque cum spiritu regerat\r\nundam undique, si, ut doctioribus placet, unum (_lege_ universum) animal\r\nest; an sint depressi aliqui specus, quo reciprocata maria residant,\r\natque unde se rursus exuberantia attollant: an luna causas tantis\r\nmeatibus præbeat.”\r\n\r\n[1295] Thirty degrees.\r\n\r\n[1296] The Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[1297] Alcolea.\r\n\r\n[1298] Some MSS. read 50 stadia.\r\n\r\n[1299] This is the sense of the text, πᾶσαν τὴν κύκλῳ παρωκεανῖτιν.\r\n\r\n[1300] We are not aware that the Ebro passes through any lake.\r\n\r\n[1301] This is probably a description of the appearance of the Druids.\r\nTacitus, (Ann. lib. xiv. 30,) speaking of the consternation into which\r\nthe Druids of Anglesey threw the Roman soldiers who had disembarked\r\nthere, says, “Druidæque circum, preces diras, sublatis ad cœlum manibus,\r\nfundentes, novitate adspectus perculere milites, ut, quasi hærentibus\r\nmembris, immobile corpus vulneribus præberent.” Immediately before these\r\nwords he thus describes the women, “Stabat pro litore diversa acies,\r\ndensa armis virisque, intercursantibus feminis in _modum furiarum_, quæ\r\nveste ferali, crinibus dejectis, faces præferebant.”\r\n\r\n[1302] Viz. that the Cassiterides are farther removed from the coasts of\r\nSpain than the rest of the southern coasts of England.\r\n\r\n[1303] Transalpine Gaul.\r\n\r\n[1304] Gaul is properly divided into the four grand divisions of the\r\nNarbonnaise, Aquitaine, Keltica, and Belgica. Strabo has principally\r\ncopied Cæsar, who appears only to have divided Gaul into Aquitaine,\r\nKeltica, and Belgica. Cæsar however only speaks of the provinces he had\r\nconquered, and makes no mention of the Narbonnaise, which had submitted\r\nto the Romans before his time. Strabo seems to have thought that the\r\nNarbonnaise formed part of Keltica.\r\n\r\n[1305] Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1306] The whole of this passage, says Gosselin, is full of mistakes,\r\nand it would seem that Strabo quoted from an inexact copy of Cæsar. To\r\nunderstand his meaning, we must remember that he supposed the Pyrenees\r\nextended from north to south, instead of from east to west; and since he\r\nadds that these mountains divide the Cevennes at right angles, he must\r\nhave supposed that this second chain extended from east to west, instead\r\nof from north to south. He likewise fancied that the Garonne, the Loire,\r\nand the Seine ran from north to south like the Rhine. Starting from such\r\npremises, it was impossible he could avoid confusion; thus we find him\r\ndescribing the Aquitani as north of the Cevennes, when in fact they\r\ndwelt north of the Pyrenees, between those mountains and the Garonne,\r\nand west of the southern portions of the Cevennes. Where he says that\r\nthe Kelts dwelt on the other side or east of the Garonne, and towards\r\nthe sea of Narbonne and Marseilles, it is clear that he prolonged\r\nKeltica into the Narbonnaise, since this last province extended along\r\nthe Mediterranean from the frontiers of Spain to the Alps. Cæsar had\r\nstated that the Gauls (the Kelts of Strabo) _ipsorum lingua Keltæ,\r\nnostri Galli_, dwelt between the Garonne, the Seine, the Marne, and the\r\nRhine. Finally, Strabo appears to have assigned the greater part of Gaul\r\nto the Belgæ in making them extend from the ocean, and the mouth of the\r\nRhine, to the Alps. This considerably embarrassed Xylander, but as we\r\nhave seen that Strabo transported a portion of the Kelts into the\r\nNarbonnaise, it is easy to imagine that, in order to make these people\r\nborder on the Belgæ, he was forced to extend them as far as the Alps,\r\nnear the sources of the Rhine. Cæsar located the Belgæ between the\r\nSeine, the ocean, and the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[1307] Liger.\r\n\r\n[1308] From the ocean to the Mediterranean, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n[1309] Alluding to the superiority of the climate on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1310] We shall see in the course of this book, that under the name of\r\nAlps Strabo includes the different mountain-chains separated from the\r\nrange of Alps properly so called. This accounts for his extending those\r\nmountains on the west as far as Marseilles, and on the east beyond\r\nIstria.\r\n\r\n[1311] The Marseillese.\r\n\r\n[1312] The Salyes inhabited Provence.\r\n\r\n[1313] As Strabo has made no previous mention of this river, the words\r\n“as we have said before” are evidently interpolated.\r\n\r\n[1314] This temple was built on Cape Creus, which on that account\r\nreceived the name of Aphrodisium. Many geographers confound this temple\r\nwith the _portus Veneris_, the modern Vendres, which is at a short\r\ndistance from Cape Creus.\r\n\r\n[1315] Nîmes.\r\n\r\n[1316] Beaucaire.\r\n\r\n[1317] Aix.\r\n\r\n[1318] Gosselin, who considers that the former numbers were correct,\r\nenters at some length on an argument to prove that these 53 miles were\r\n62, and differs also in computing the succeeding numbers.\r\n\r\n[1319] The cantons of Vaison and Die.\r\n\r\n[1320] Cottius possessed the present Briançonnais. That portion of the\r\nAlps next this canton took from this sovereign the name of the Cottian\r\nAlps. Cottius bore the title of king; and Augustus recognised his\r\nindependence; he lived till the time of Nero, when his possessions\r\nbecame a Roman province.\r\n\r\n[1321] Nîmes.\r\n\r\n[1322] Durance and Cavaillon.\r\n\r\n[1323] Embrun.\r\n\r\n[1324] Briançon.\r\n\r\n[1325] Sezanne, or perhaps Chamlat de Seguin.\r\n\r\n[1326] Uxeau.\r\n\r\n[1327] About 600 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[1328] Ἀφίδρυμά τι τῶν ἱερῶν. Gosselin gives a note on these words, and\r\ntranslates them in his text as follows, “one of the statues consecrated\r\nin her temple.”\r\n\r\n[1329] τιμοῦχος, literally, one having honour and esteem.\r\n\r\n[1330] We have seen no reason to depart from a literal rendering of the\r\nGreek in this passage, its meaning, “whose ancestors have not been\r\ncitizens,” &c., being self-evident.\r\n\r\n[1331] This name has evidently been corrupted, but it seems difficult to\r\ndetermine what stood originally in the text; most probably it was\r\nRhodanusia.\r\n\r\n[1332] Agde.\r\n\r\n[1333] Taurenti.\r\n\r\n[1334] Eoube.\r\n\r\n[1335] Antibes.\r\n\r\n[1336] Nice.\r\n\r\n[1337] The people of Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[1338] Aquæ Sextiæ, now Aix.\r\n\r\n[1339] Solinus tells us that in his day the waters had lost their\r\nvirtue, and that their fame had declined. “Quarum calor, olim acrior,\r\nexhalatus per tempora evaporavit; nec jam par est famæ priori.” _Solin._\r\ncap. 8. The victory of Sextius, mentioned by Strabo, is said to have\r\nbeen gained in the year of Rome 629.\r\n\r\n[1340] The Cape de Creus, a promontory on which was the temple of the\r\nPyrenæan Venus.\r\n\r\n[1341] The Gulf of Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1342] The Cape de Cette.\r\n\r\n[1343] Gosselin says, “The Island of Blascon is a rock opposite Agde, on\r\nwhich remains a fortified castle, which preserves the name of Brescon.\r\nThis rock has been connected with the mainland, to form the port of\r\nAgde.”\r\n\r\n[1344] Ἄταξ.\r\n\r\n[1345] At the present day Narbonne is not situated on the Aude, the\r\ncourse of that river being changed.

This, Kramer observes, Strabo\r\nprobably intended to do. Still, as there were some who were of opinion\r\nthe Rhone has seven mouths, as appears from Apoll. Rhod.

The\r\nTricorii appear to have inhabited a small district east of Die, on the\r\nbanks of the Drac.

After their conquest of the southern\r\nprovinces, they distinguished them from the rest of Keltica by\r\nconferring on them the name of Gallia Narbonensis. Aristotle gave the\r\nname of Kelts to the inhabitants of the country near Narbonne. Polybius\r\ntells us that the Pyrenees separated the Iberians from the Kelts; while\r\nDiodorus Siculus fixed the position of the Kelts between the Alps and\r\nthe Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[1408] “Strabo,” says Gosselin, “always, argues on the hypothesis that\r\nthe Pyrenees run from south to north; that the Garonne and the Loire\r\nflowed in the same direction; that the Cevennes stretched from west to\r\neast; and that the coasts of Gaul, from the Pyrenees, rose gently\r\ntowards the north, bending considerably east.”\r\n\r\n[1409] The Garonne becomes navigable at Cazères near to Rieux, in the\r\nancient Comté de Comminges. From this point to its mouth, following the\r\nsinuosities of the river, there are about 68 leagues of 20 to a degree,\r\nor 2030 Olympic stadia. The Loire is navigable as far as St. Rambert,\r\nabout three leagues from St. Etienne-en-Forez, that is to say, double\r\nthe distance assigned by Strabo. 2000 stadia measured from the mouth of\r\nthe Loire would extend merely as far as Orleans.\r\n\r\n[1410] Probably the Arriége, the Tarn, and the Dordogne.\r\n\r\n[1411] Ἰοσκῶν MSS.\r\n\r\n[1412] The present Saintes was the capital of this nation.\r\n\r\n[1413] Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n[1414] Poictiers was the capital of the Pictones or Pictavi, and Nantes\r\nof the Namnetæ.\r\n\r\n[1415] Scipio Æmilianus.\r\n\r\n[1416] Saintes.\r\n\r\n[1417] The Gulfs of Gascony and Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1418] The Tarbelli occupied the sea-coast from the Pyrenees to the Lake\r\nof Arcachon.\r\n\r\n[1419] The Canton of Comminges.\r\n\r\n[1420] St. Bertrand.\r\n\r\n[1421] Xylander thinks that these Onesii may be identical with the\r\nMonesi of Pliny. Gosselin says that the hot springs are probably the\r\nbaths of Bagnières-sur-l’Adour.\r\n\r\n[1422] The territory of the city of Auch.\r\n\r\n[1423] The inhabitants of Vivarais.\r\n\r\n[1424] The inhabitants of Vélai.\r\n\r\n[1425] The inhabitants of Auvergne.\r\n\r\n[1426] The Limousins.\r\n\r\n[1427] The inhabitants of Périgord, Agénois, Querci, and Berri.\r\n\r\n[1428] The inhabitants of Saintonge and Poitou.\r\n\r\n[1429] The inhabitants of Rouergue and Gévaudan.\r\n\r\n[1430] Gosselin supposes that this city is Clermont in Auvergne at some\r\ndistance from the Allier.\r\n\r\n[1431] Orleans.\r\n\r\n[1432] The people of the Chartrain.\r\n\r\n[1433] Cæsar himself (lib. vii. c. 76) states the number at 248,000 men.\r\n\r\n[1434] A city near Clermont.\r\n\r\n[1435] Alise. The ruins of Alesia, says Gosselin, still exist near to\r\nFlavigni in Burgundy, on Mount Auxois, between two small rivers, the Oze\r\nand the Ozerain, which flow into the Brenne.\r\n\r\n[1436] The Sorgue.\r\n\r\n[1437] In Athenæus, (lib. iv. p. 152,) this name is written Luernius.\r\n\r\n[1438] Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1439] MSS. read ὑπὸ, “under,” we have not hesitated to translate it\r\nἐπὶ, like the Italian, French, and German versions; although Kramer\r\nremarks “paulo audacius,” of Coray’s reading ἐπὶ in the Greek.\r\n\r\n[1440] Ἄραρ.\r\n\r\n[1441] Kramer says that ἄλλος is manifestly corrupt.—I have ventured to\r\ntranslate it _another altar_.\r\n\r\n[1442] Kramer concurs with Falconer and Gosselin in understanding this\r\npassage to have been originally between the Rhone and the Loire.\r\n\r\n[1443] Σηκοάνας.\r\n\r\n[1444] The Sequani.\r\n\r\n[1445] Châlons-sur-Saone.\r\n\r\n[1446] Autun, according to Gosselin.

See also Diodorus\r\nSiculus, lib. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[1489] A similar custom existed amongst the Spartans; the young people\r\nwere obliged to present themselves from time to time before the Ephori,\r\nand if of the bulk thought proper for a Spartan, they were praised, if\r\non the contrary they appeared too fat, they were punished. Athen. l.\r\nxii. p. 550. Ælian, V. H. l. xiv. c. 7.

No. 30, p. 198.\r\n\r\n[1494] Cæsar passed twice into Britain: the first time he started about\r\nmidnight, and arrived at the fourth hour of the day; the second time he\r\nstarted at the commencement of the night, and did not arrive until the\r\nfollowing day at noon, the wind having failed about midnight.\r\n\r\n[1495] The fleet consisted of 1000 vessels, according to Cotta. (Athen.\r\nl. vi. c. 21.) The great loss spoken of by Strabo occurred before the\r\nfirst return of Cæsar into Gaul. (Cæsar, l. iv. c. 28.) As to his second\r\nreturn, it was occasioned, to use his own words, “propter repentinos\r\nGalliæ motus.” L. v. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[1496] Called by Cæsar, Hibernia; by Mela, Juverna; and by Diodorus\r\nSiculus, Iris.\r\n\r\n[1497] This custom resembles that related by Herodotus (lib. i. c. 216,\r\nand iv. 26) of the Massagetæ and Issedoni. Amongst these latter, when\r\nthe father of a family died, all the relatives assembled at the house of\r\nthe deceased, and having slain certain animals, cut them and the body of\r\nthe deceased into small pieces, and having mixed the morsels together,\r\nregaled themselves on the inhuman feast.\r\n\r\n[1498] Strabo intends by φανερῶς what Herodotus expresses by μίξιν\r\nἐμφανέα, καθάπερ τοῖσι προβάτοισι (_concubitum, sicuti pecoribus, in\r\npropatulo esse_).\r\n\r\n[1499] Herodotus, (l. iv. c. 180,) mentioning a similar practice amongst\r\nthe inhabitants of Lake Tritonis in Libya, tells us that the men owned\r\nthe children as they resembled them respectively. Mela asserts the same\r\nof the Garamantes. As to the commerce between relations, Strabo in his\r\n16th Book, speaks of it as being usual amongst the Arabs. It was a\r\ncustom amongst the early Greeks. Homer makes the six sons of Æolus marry\r\ntheir six sisters, and Juno addresses herself to Jupiter as “Et soror et\r\nconjux.” Compare also Cæsar, lib. v.\r\n\r\n[1500] An extremity to which the Gauls were driven during the war they\r\nsustained against the Cimbri and Teutones, (Cæsar, lib. vii. c. 77,) and\r\nthe inhabitants of Numantia in Iberia, when besieged by Scipio.\r\n(Valerius Maximus, lib. vii. c. 6.) The city of Potidæa in Greece\r\nexperienced a similar calamity. (Thucyd. lib. ii. c. 70.)\r\n\r\n[1501] Pytheas placed Thule under the 66th degree of north latitude,\r\nwhich is the latitude of the north of Iceland.\r\n\r\n[1502] Transalpine Gaul.\r\n\r\n[1503] Port Monaco.\r\n\r\n[1504] Vadi.\r\n\r\n[1505] Albinga.\r\n\r\n[1506] Vintimille.\r\n\r\n[1507] Kramer conjectures that instead of Ἀλπιόνια, we should read\r\nἈλπεινὰ.\r\n\r\n[1508] These people occupied the borders of the province of Murlaka,\r\nnear to Istria, on the Gulf of Venice. Mount Albius is still called\r\nAlben.\r\n\r\n[1509] Casaubon observes that the Roman writers separated the name\r\nAlbium Ingaunum, in the same manner as Albium Intemelium.\r\n\r\n[1510] These two tribes inhabited the country round Fréjus and Antibes\r\nas far as the Var.\r\n\r\n[1511] Or amber.\r\n\r\n[1512] Μόνοικος, an epithet of Hercules signifying “sole inhabitant.”\r\nAccording to Servius, either because after he had driven out the\r\nLigurians he remained the sole inhabitant of the country; or because it\r\nwas not usual to associate any other divinities in the temples\r\nconsecrated to him.\r\n\r\n[1513] Λίγυες, or Ligurians.\r\n\r\n[1514] Λιγυστικὴ, or Liguria.\r\n\r\n[1515] Κελτολίγυες, or Kelto-Ligurians.\r\n\r\n[1516] Kramer is of opinion that we should adopt the suggestion of\r\nMannert, to read here Avignon.\r\n\r\n[1517] We have adopted the reading of the older editions, which is also\r\nthat of the French translation. Kramer however reads φόβον, and adds\r\nφόρον in a note.\r\n\r\n[1518] The Albiœci are named Albici in Cæsar; the capital city is called\r\nby Pliny Alebece Reiorum; it is now Riez in Provence.\r\n\r\n[1519] Nîmes.\r\n\r\n[1520] There are two rivers of this name which descend from the Alps and\r\ndischarge themselves into the Po. The Durias which rises near the\r\nDurance is the _Durias minor_ of the ancients, and the Doria Riparia of\r\nthe moderns; this river falls into the Po at Turin.\r\n\r\n[1521] Gosselin observes:—The Salassi occupied the country about Aouste,\r\nor Aoste. The name of this city is a corruption of Augusta Prætoria\r\nSalassorum, which it received in the time of Augustus. The Durias which\r\npasses by Aouste is the _Durias major_, the modern Doria Baltea. Its\r\nsources are between the Great Saint Bernard and Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\n[1522] The Ister of the classics.\r\n\r\n[1523] _Augusta Taurinorum_, hodie Turin, was the capital of these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[1524] Various conjectures have been hazarded concerning this name, of\r\nwhich there appears to be no other mention.\r\n\r\n[1525] The Kentrones occupied la Tarentaise; the Catoriges, the\r\nterritories of Chorges and Embrun; the Veragri, a part of the Valais\r\nsouth of the Rhone; and the Nantuatæ, Le Chablais.\r\n\r\n[1526] The Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\n[1527] Saint Gothard.\r\n\r\n[1528] The Adda does not flow from the same mountain as the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[1529] The Lake of Como.\r\n\r\n[1530] The Rhæti are the Grisons; the Vennones, the people of the Val\r\nTelline.\r\n\r\n[1531] The Lepontii inhabited the Haut Valais, and the valley of\r\nLeventina; the Tridentini occupied Trente; the Stoni, Sténéco.\r\n\r\n[1532] The valley of Aouste.\r\n\r\n[1533] These two routes still exist. The former passes by the Great\r\nSaint Bernard, or the Pennine Alps; the latter traverses the Little\r\nSaint Bernard, and descends into La Tarentaise, formerly occupied by the\r\nCentrones.\r\n\r\n[1534] Anciently Durias.\r\n\r\n[1535] Modena.\r\n\r\n[1536] It does not appear that Julius Cæsar is here intended, for he\r\nmentions nothing of it in his Commentaries. It seems more probable that\r\nStrabo used the expression of Cæsar in its wider sense of Emperor, and\r\nalludes to Augustus, of whom he speaks immediately after.\r\n\r\n[1537] Ivrea.\r\n\r\n[1538] Aouste.\r\n\r\n[1539] The limits of these barbarous nations were continually varying\r\naccording to their success in war, in general, however, the Rhæti\r\npossessed the country of the Grisons, the Tyrol, and the district about\r\nTrent. The Lepontii possessed the Val Leventina. The Camuni the Val\r\nCamonica. The Vindelici occupied a portion of Bavaria and Suabia; on\r\ntheir west were the Helvetii or Swiss, and on the north the Boii, from\r\nwhom they were separated by the Danube; these last people have left\r\ntheir name to Bohemia. The Norici possessed Styria, Carinthia, a part of\r\nAustria and Bavaria to the south of the Danube. The Breuni have given\r\ntheir name to the Val Braunia north of the Lago Maggiore; and the\r\nGenauni appear to have inhabited the Val Agno, between Lake Maggiore and\r\nthe Lake of Como, although Strabo seems to place these people on the\r\nnorthern side of the Alps, towards the confines of Illyria.\r\n\r\n[1540] The people of Franche Comté.\r\n\r\n[1541] The Germans of Wirtemberg and Suabia.\r\n\r\n[1542] The Licattii appear to have inhabited the country about the Lech,\r\nand the Clautinatii that about the Inn; the Vennones the Val Telline.\r\n\r\n[1543] This disgusting brutality however is no more barbarous than the\r\nintention put by Homer into the mouth of Agamemnon, “the king of men,”\r\nwhich Scholiasts have in vain endeavoured to soften or excuse—\r\n\r\n               τῶν μήτις ὑπεκφύγοι αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,\r\n   χεῖράς θ’ ἡμετέρας· μηδ’ ὅντινα γαστέρι μήτηρ\r\n   κοῦρον ἐόντα φέροι, μηδ’ ὃς φύγοι· ἀλλ’ ἅμα πάντες\r\n   Ἰλίου ἐξαπολοίατ’, ἀκήδεστοι καὶ ἄφαντοι.\r\n\r\n   Iliad vi. 57-60.\r\n\r\n[1544] This expedition of Tiberius took place in the eleventh year of\r\nthe Christian era; Strabo therefore must have written his fourth book in\r\nthe 44th year.\r\n\r\n[1545] The Carnic, or Julian Alps, is intended.\r\n\r\n[1546] Ἄταξ.\r\n\r\n[1547] There is, remarks Gosselin, a palpable mistake in this passage.\r\nWe neither know of a river named the Isar nor yet the Atax discharging\r\nthemselves into the Adriatic. Atesinus or Athesis are the ancient names\r\nof the Adige, but this river flows into the Adriatic, and not, as Strabo\r\nseems to say, into the Danube. The error of the text appears to result\r\nfrom a transposition of the two names made by the copyists, and to\r\nrender it intelligible we should read thus:—“There is a lake from which\r\nproceeds the Atesinus, (or the Adige,) and which, after having received\r\nthe Atax, (perhaps the Eisack, or Aicha, which flows by Bolzano,)\r\ndischarges itself into the Adriatic. The Isar proceeds from the same\r\nlake, and [passing by Munich] discharges itself into the Danube.”\r\n\r\n[1548] Apparently the lake of Constance.\r\n\r\n[1549] The Black Forest.\r\n\r\n[1550] These two chains are in Murlaka, they are now named Telez and\r\nFliez.\r\n\r\n[1551] The Traun or Würm.\r\n\r\n[1552] The Glan in Bavaria.\r\n\r\n[1553] The Julian Alps, and Birnbaumerwald.\r\n\r\n[1554] Probably Mödling.\r\n\r\n[1555] Auersperg, or the Flecken Mungava.\r\n\r\n[1556] Möttnig or Mansburg.\r\n\r\n[1557] Windisch Grätz, or Brindjel.\r\n\r\n[1558] Now Sisseck.\r\n\r\n[1559] The text reads Rhine, but we have, in common with Gosselin,\r\nfollowed the correction of Cluvier, Xylander, and Tyrwhitt.\r\n\r\n[1560] The Dacians occupied a part of Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia,\r\nand a portion of Moldavia.\r\n\r\n[1561] Coray suggests Nauportus, _now_ Ober-Laibach in Krain. This\r\nsuggestion is extremely probable, however Pamportus occurs twice in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n[1562] The river Laibach.\r\n\r\n[1563] The Pannonians occupied a portion of Austria and Hungary. The\r\nTaurisci, who formed part of the former people, inhabited Styria.\r\n\r\n[1564] Segesta.\r\n\r\n[1565] The ancient Colapis.\r\n\r\n[1566] This is a description of the elk (cervus alces of Linn.). This\r\nanimal no longer exists either in France or in the Alps.\r\n\r\n[1567] Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1568] La Saintonge.\r\n\r\n[1569] Gascony.\r\n\r\n[1570] Beauvoisis.\r\n\r\n[1571] Picardie.\r\n\r\n[1572] From Lyons this route passed by Vienne, Valence, Orange, and\r\nAvignon; here it separated, leading on one side to Tarascon, Nîmes,\r\nBeziers, and Narbonne, and on the other to Ailes, Aix, Marseilles,\r\nFréjus, Antibes, &c.\r\n\r\n[1573] This other route, says Gosselin, starting from Aouste, traversed\r\nthe Great Saint Bernard, Valais, the Rhone, a portion of the Vaud, Mount\r\nJura, and so to Besançon and Langres, where it separated, the road to\r\nthe right passing by Toul, Metz, and Trèves, approached the Rhine at\r\nMayence; while that to the left passed by Troies, Châlons, Rheims, and\r\nBavai, where it again separated and conducted by various points to the\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\n[1574] The Italians also went into Spain, and there engaged in working\r\nthe mines. Vide Diodorus Siculus, lib. v. c. 36, 38.\r\n\r\n[1575] A mountain of Laconia.\r\n\r\n[1576] In Arcadia, some suppose it to be the modern Tetragi, others\r\nDiaphorti, and others Mintha.\r\n\r\n[1577] In Phocis, Iapara, or Liokura.\r\n\r\n[1578] Olympus is a mountain range of Thessaly, bordering on Macedonia,\r\nits summit is thirty miles north of Larissa, in lat. 40° 4’ 32” N.,\r\nlong. 22° 25’ E. Its estimated height is 9745 feet.\r\n\r\n[1579] Petras _or_ Zagora.\r\n\r\n[1580] Now Kissovo; it is situated to the east of the river Peneus,\r\nimmediately north of Mount Pelion, and bounds the celebrated vale of\r\nTempe on one side.\r\n\r\n[1581] Gosselin observes, both Polybius and Strabo extended the Alps\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Marseilles to beyond the Adriatic Gulf, a\r\ndistance twice 2200 stadia. It appeals probable from the words of\r\nPolybius himself, (lib. ii c. 14,) that he merely intended to state the\r\nlength of the plains situated at the foot of the mountains, which bound\r\nItaly on the north, and in fact the distance in a right line from the\r\nfoot of the Alps about Rivoli or Pignerol to Rovigo, and the marshes\r\nformed at the mouths of the Adige and Po, is 63 leagues, or 2200 stadia\r\nof 700 to a degree.\r\n\r\n[1582] This route passes from Tortona, by Vadi, Albinga, Vintimille, and\r\nMonaco, where it crosses the maritime Alps, and thence to Nice, Antibes,\r\n&c. _Gosselin._\r\n\r\n[1583] This route passes by Briançon, Mont Genèvre, the Col de\r\nSestrière, and the Val Progelas.\r\n\r\n[1584] The passage by the Val Aouste.\r\n\r\n[1585] This route, starting from Milan, passed east of the lake of Como\r\nby Coire, and then by Bregentz to the Lake of Constance.\r\n\r\n[1586] The Lago di Garda.\r\n\r\n[1587] Lago Maggiore.\r\n\r\n[1588] Ticinus. We have followed the example of the French translators\r\nin making the Ticino to flow from the Lago Maggiore, and the Adda from\r\nthe Lake of Como; by some inexplicable process the text of Strabo has\r\nbeen corrupted and these rivers transposed. Kramer notices the\r\ninconsistency of the text.\r\n\r\n[1589] The Lake of Como.\r\n\r\n[1590] The Gulf of Salerno.\r\n\r\n[1591] Venetians.\r\n\r\n[1592] Rimini.\r\n\r\n[1593] Capo di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[1594] Venetians.\r\n\r\n[1595] The peninsula occupied by the people named Brettii, or Bruttii.\r\n\r\n[1596] The peninsula now designated Terra di Lecce, and called by the\r\nancients sometimes Iapygia, at others Messapia, Calabria, and Salentina.\r\nThe isthmus of this peninsula was supposed to be formed by a line drawn\r\nfrom Brindisi to Taranto.\r\n\r\n[1597] The Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n[1598] The Sea of Tuscany.\r\n\r\n[1599] The Gulf of Salerno.\r\n\r\n[1600] Capo di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[1601] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1602] Capo dell’ Armi.\r\n\r\n[1603] Of Vannes.\r\n\r\n[1604] From the Heneti, whence is the race of wild mules.

The largest of these lagoons are at the mouths of\r\nthe Po, the others at the mouths of the torrents which descend from the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\n[1608] Milan.\r\n\r\n[1609] Apparently a mistake for Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus; we\r\nare unacquainted with any Caius Scipio.\r\n\r\n[1610] The Lake of Como.\r\n\r\n[1611] The source of the Adda is at the foot of Mount Braulio; the three\r\nsources of the Rhine issue from Mounts St. Bernardin, St. Barnabé, and\r\nCrispalt, at a considerable distance from the source of the Adda.\r\n\r\n[1612] Padua.\r\n\r\n[1613] This appears to have been the last census of the three taken\r\nunder the reign of Augustus. The first occurred in the year of Rome 726,\r\ntwenty-eight years before the Christian era; the number of citizens then\r\namounted to 4,064,000, or, according to Eusebius, 4,011,017. The second\r\nwas in the year of Rome 746, eight years before the Christian era; the\r\nnumber of citizens was then found to be 4,163,000. The third census was\r\nin the year of Rome 767, in the fourteenth year of the Christian era;\r\nthe number of citizens at this time was 4,037,000, according to the\r\nmonument of Ancyra, but according to Eusebius, 9,070,000.\r\n\r\n[1614] Chioggia.\r\n\r\n[1615] The Bacchiglione.\r\n\r\n[1616] ξυλοπαγὴς ὅλη. We have followed the rendering of the French\r\ntranslators; however, Guarini, Buonaccivoli, Xylander, Siebenkees, and\r\nBréquigny, all understand Strabo to mean that the city was built\r\nentirely of wood.\r\n\r\n[1617] Altino.\r\n\r\n[1618] Butrio.\r\n\r\n[1619] Spinazino.\r\n\r\n[1620] Oderzo.\r\n\r\n[1621] Adria.\r\n\r\n[1622] Vicenza.\r\n\r\n[1623] About the year 186 before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[1624] Friesach in Steiermark.\r\n\r\n[1625] 113 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[1626] S.

See Virg. Ecl. vi. 62; Æn.\r\nx. 190; Ovid Met. ii.\r\n\r\n[1632] Either this passage has undergone alteration, or else Strabo is\r\nthe only writer who informs us that certain mythological traditions\r\ndistinguished the Eridanus from the Po, placing the former of these\r\nrivers in the vicinity of the latter. The père Bardetti thinks the\r\nGreeks originally confounded the Eretenus, a tributary of the Po, with\r\nthe name Eridanus.\r\n\r\n[1633] Probably Guinea-hens.\r\n\r\n[1634] Strabo seems here to doubt that the Electrides islands ever\r\nexisted, but the French translators, in a very judicious note, have\r\nexplained that the geographical features of the country about the mouths\r\nof the Po had undergone very considerable changes on account of the\r\nimmense alluvial deposit brought down from the mountains by that river,\r\nand suggest that these islands had been united to the mainland long\r\nbefore Strabo’s time, for which reason he would not be able to verify\r\nthe ancient traditions. Even at the present day the Cavalier Negrelli is\r\nemploying his celebrated engineering science in making the communication\r\nbetween the Po and the Adriatic navigable, and so rendering the\r\ncountries bordering on the Ticino, Adda, Mincio, Trebbia, Panono, and\r\nthe adjacent lakes accessible to steam-boats from the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n[1635] The Timavum, or temple consecrated to Diomede.\r\n\r\n[1636] The Isola di Brioni, Conversara, and S.

Æmilius Scaurus.\r\n\r\n[1666] Strabo here falls into a mistake in attributing to C. Flaminius\r\nNepos, who was consul in the year of Rome 567, 187 years before the\r\nChristian era, the construction of the Via Flaminia which led from the\r\nPortus Flumentana to the city of Ariminum. According to most Latin\r\nauthors, this grand route was formed by C. Flaminius Nepos, censor in\r\nthe year of Rome 534, and 220 years before the Christian era (the same\r\nwho three years afterwards was slain at the battle of Thrasymenus).\r\nLivy, whose authority is certainly of great weight, speaking of the\r\ngrand road made by C.

Livy also mentions a young citizen of Clusium\r\nnamed Lucumo. But there is reason to believe that these three writers\r\nwere deceived by the writers whom they followed. It seems to be\r\nincontestable that Lucumo was the designation of the chief of each of\r\nthe twelve cities of Etruria.\r\n\r\n[1684] Dionysius Halicarnassius relates that after a brisk war the cities\r\nof Etruria submitted to Tarquinius Priscus, and that the Romans\r\npermitted him to accept this foreign royalty, and still hold the throne\r\nof Rome.

Holstenius thinks that it was on the southern shore,\r\nin the locality of Villa-Domitiana. The Abbé de Chaupy places it farther\r\nto the east of Monte Albano.\r\n\r\n[1803] Monte Albano.\r\n\r\n[1804] The sites of these places are much disputed.\r\n\r\n[1805] Kramer considers this 40 an interpolation.\r\n\r\n[1806] Usually Ambarvalia, sacrifices performed by the Fratres Arvales,\r\nwho formed “a college or company of twelve in number, and were so called\r\naccording to Varro, from offering public sacrifices for the fertility of\r\nthe fields. That they were of extreme antiquity is proved by the legend\r\nwhich refers their institution to Romulus; of whom it is said, that when\r\nhis nurse, Acca Laurentia, lost one of her twelve sons, he allowed\r\nhimself to be adopted by her in his place, and called himself and the\r\nremaining eleven—Fratres Arvales. (Gell. vi. 7.) We also find a college\r\ncalled the Sodales Titii, and as the latter were confessedly of Sabine\r\norigin, and instituted for the purpose of keeping up the Sabine\r\nreligious rites, (Tac. Ann. i. 53,) there is some reason for the\r\nsupposition of Niebuhr, that these colleges corresponded one to the\r\nother—the Fratres Arvales being connected with the Latin, and the\r\nSodales Titii with the Sabine element of the Roman state; just as there\r\nwere two colleges of the Luperci, the Fabii and the Quinctilii, the\r\nformer of whom seem to have belonged to the Sabines.\r\n\r\nThe office of the Fratres Arvales was for life, and was not taken away\r\neven from an exile or captive. They wore, as a badge of office, a\r\nchaplet of ears of corn fastened on their heads with a white band. The\r\nnumber given on inscriptions varies, but it is never more than nine;\r\nthough, according to the legend and general belief, it amounted to\r\ntwelve. One of their annual duties was to celebrate a three days’\r\nfestival in honour of Dea Dia, supposed to be Ceres.... Of this the\r\nmaster of the college, appointed annually, gave public notice from the\r\ntemple of Concord on the Capitol. On the first and last of these days,\r\nthe college met at the house of their president, to make offerings to\r\nthe Dea Dia; on the second day they assembled in the grove of the same\r\ngoddess, about five miles south of Rome, and there offered sacrifices\r\nfor the fertility of the earth. An account of the different ceremonies\r\nof this festival is preserved in an inscription, which was written in\r\nthe first year of the emperor Heliogabalus, (A. D. 218,) who was elected\r\na member of the college under the name of M. Aurelius Antoninus Pius\r\nFelix. The same inscription contains a hymn, which appears to have been\r\nsung at the festival from the most ancient times.\r\n\r\nBesides this festival of the Dea Dia, the Fratres Arvales were required\r\non various occasions under the emperors to make vows and offer up\r\nthanksgivings, an enumeration of which is given in Porcellini. Strabo\r\nindeed informs us that, in the reign of Tiberius, these priests\r\nperformed sacrifices called the _Ambarvalia_ at various places on the\r\nborders of the Ager Romanus, or original territory of Rome; and amongst\r\nothers, at Festi. There is no boldness in supposing that this was a\r\ncustom handed down from time immemorial; and, moreover, that it was a\r\nduty of this priesthood to invoke a blessing upon the whole territory of\r\nRome. It is proved by inscriptions that this college existed till the\r\nreign of the emperor Gordian, or A. D. 325, and it is probable that it\r\nwas not abolished till A. D. 400, together with the other colleges of\r\nthe pagan priesthoods.\r\n\r\nThe private Ambarvalia were certainly of a different nature to those\r\nmentioned by Strabo, and were so called from the victim _hostia\r\nAmbarvalis_ that was slain on the occasion, being led three times round\r\nthe corn-fields, before the sickle was put to the corn. This victim was\r\naccompanied by a crowd of merry-makers, (_chorus et socii_,) the reapers\r\nand farm-servants, dancing and singing, as they marched along, the\r\npraises of Ceres, and praying for her favour and presence while they\r\noffered her the libations of milk, honey, and wine. (Virg. _Georg._ i.\r\n338.) This ceremony was also called a _lustratio_, (Virg. _Ecl._ v. 83,)\r\nor purification; and for a beautiful description of the holiday, and the\r\nprayers and vows made on the occasion, the reader is referred to\r\nTibullus (ii. 1). It is perhaps worth while to remark that Polybius (iv.\r\n21, § 9) uses language almost applicable to the Roman Ambarvalia in\r\nspeaking of the Mantineians, who, he says, (specifying the occasion,)\r\nmade a purification, and carried victims round the city and all the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a still greater resemblance to the rites we have been\r\ndescribing, in the ceremonies of the Rogation or gang-week of the Latin\r\nchurch. These consisted of processions through the fields, accompanied\r\nwith prayers (_rogationes_) for a blessing on the fruits of the earth,\r\nand were continued during three days in Whitsun-week. The custom was\r\nabolished at the Reformation in consequence of its abuses, and the\r\nperambulation of the parish boundaries substituted in its place. (_Vide_\r\nHooker, Eccl. Pol. v. 61, 2; Wheatley, Com. Pray. v. 20. Bohn’s Standard\r\nLibrary edition.)\r\n\r\n[1807] The Camenæ, says Dr. Smith, were prophetic nymphs, and belonged\r\nto the religion of ancient Italy, although later traditions represent\r\nthem as having been introduced into Italy from Arcadia. Two of the\r\nCamenæ were Antevorta and Postvorta; the third was Carmenta or\r\nCarmentis, a prophetic and healing divinity, who had a temple at the\r\nfoot of the Capitoline hill, and altars near the Porta Carmentalis. The\r\ntraditions which assigned a Greek origin to her worship at Rome, state\r\nthat her original name was Nicostrata, and that she was called Carmentis\r\nfron her prophetic powers. (Serv. _ad Æn._ viii. 51, 336; Dionys. i. 15,\r\n32.) According to these traditions, she was the mother of Evander, the\r\nArcadian, by Hermes, and after having endeavoured to persuade her son to\r\nkill Hermes, she fled with him to Italy, where she gave oracles to the\r\npeople and to Hercules. She was put to death by her son at the age of\r\n110 years, and then obtained divine honours.

Fifteen years afterwards he established a\r\ncompany of seven freedmen, presided over by one of the equestrian order,\r\nto see what means could be taken in order to prevent these numerous\r\nfires. Augustus, however, was not the first to take precautions of this\r\nnature, as we may learn from Livy, l. ix. § 46; l. xxxix. § 14; Tacit.\r\nAnnal. l. xv. § 43, and various other authorities.\r\n\r\n[1847] Subsequent emperors reduced this standard still lower.

Cretona, not Monte Rotondo.\r\n\r\n[1900] The younger Marius being entirely defeated by Sulla in the\r\ndecisive battle fought near Sacriportus, B. C. 82, Marius threw himself\r\ninto Præneste, where he had deposited the treasures of the Capitoline\r\ntemple. (Pliny H. N. l. xxxiii. s. 5.) Sulla left Lucretius Opella to\r\nprosecute the siege while he hastened on to Rome. Various efforts were\r\nmade to relieve Præneste, but they all failed; and after Sulla’s great\r\nvictory at the Colline gate of Rome, in which Pontius Telesinus was\r\ndefeated and slain, Marius despaired of holding out any longer, and in\r\ncompany with the brother of Telesinus attempted to escape by a\r\nsubterraneous passage, which led from the town into the open country;\r\nbut finding that their flight was discovered, they put an end to one\r\nanother’s lives. According to other accounts, Marius killed himself, or\r\nwas killed by his slave at his own request. Marius perished in the year\r\nof his consulship. Smith, Dict. Biogr. and Myth.\r\n\r\n[1901] The Abbé Chaupy is inclined to think that this was a name given\r\nto the part nearest the source of the river which Strabo, § 9, calls the\r\nTrerus, but Kramer thinks it was originally written ὁ Τρῆρος, and\r\ncorrupted by the copyists.\r\n\r\n[1902] Monte Cavo.\r\n\r\n[1903] We have translated literally ἔχει δ’ ὅμως ἐρυμνὴν ἄκραν, but it\r\nis possible that Strabo may have meant that the citadel was built on a\r\nheight above the town; if so the citadel would occupy the site of la\r\nRiccia.\r\n\r\n[1904] Civita Lavinia, or, Città della Vigna.\r\n\r\n[1905] Or Grove of Diana.\r\n\r\n[1906] Nemus Ariciæ.\r\n\r\n[1907] The text here appears to be mutilated.\r\n\r\n[1908] Monte Cavo.\r\n\r\n[1909] The Lago d’ Albano.\r\n\r\n[1910] Alba Fucensis is here intended: _hod._ Albi.\r\n\r\n[1911] The Judicello.\r\n\r\n[1912] Catania, in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[1913] See Pliny in reference to the Aqua Marcia, Hist.

C.\r\n\r\n[1939] Pentima near Popoli.\r\n\r\n[1940] The first consuls were Q. Pompædius Silo, and C. Aponius Mutilus;\r\nthe prætors were Herius Asinius for the Marucini, C. Veltius Cato for\r\nthe Marsi, M. Lamponius and T. Cleptius for the Leucani, Marius Egnatius\r\nTrebatius and Pontius Telesinus for the Samnites, C. Judacilius for the\r\nApuli or Picentini, and A. Cluentius for the Peligni. Many other\r\nofficers besides these distinguished themselves in the several campaigns\r\nof the Marsian war.\r\n\r\n[1941] A note in the French translation would make the duration of the\r\nMarsian war twelve years.\r\n\r\n[1942] Diodorus Siculus agrees with Strabo, in asserting that this war\r\nwas called Marsian, because it had been commenced by the Marsi, Ὠνομάσθαι\r\nδέ φησι Μαρσικὸν [i. e. πόλεμον] ἐκ τῶν ἀρξάντων τῆς ἀποστάσεως,\r\nhowever, Velleius Paterculus asserts that the people of Asculum\r\ncommenced the war, which was continued by the Marsi; and Livy (Epit.\r\nlib. lxxii.) makes the Picentini the first to raise the standard of\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n[1943] Quintus Pompædius Silo.\r\n\r\n[1944] _Now_ Sulmona, about seven miles south-east of Corfinium. It was\r\nthe birth-place of Ovid.\r\n\r\n   Sulmo mihi patria est gelidis uberrimus undis.\r\n\r\n   _Ovid. Trist._ iv. El. 9.\r\n\r\n[1945]\r\n\r\n   Marruvium, veteris celebratum nomine Marri,\r\n   Urbibus est illis caput.\r\n\r\n   _Sil. Ital._ viii. 507.\r\n\r\nWe must place this city, with Holstenius, at San Benedetto, on the\r\neastern shore of the lake, where inscriptions have been found which\r\nleave no doubt on the subject. The coins of Marruvium have MARUB on the\r\nreverse and a head of Pluto.\r\n\r\n[1946] Now Chieti, on the right bank of the Pescara. The family of\r\nAsinius Pollio came originally from this place.\r\n\r\n[1947] Pescara.\r\n\r\n[1948] Ortona-a-Mare.\r\n\r\n[1949] Romanelli, (tom. iii. p. 40,) founding his opinion on ancient\r\necclesiastical records and the reports of local antiquaries, informs us\r\nthat the ruins of Buca exist at the present Penna.\r\n\r\n[1950] According to Holstenius and Romanelli, Civitate; according to\r\nothers, Ponte Rotto.\r\n\r\n[1951] Kramer is of opinion that this passage, from “Ortonium” to\r\n“life,” is an interpolation posterior to the age of Strabo.\r\n\r\n[1952] Romanelli affirms that the mountain from which the river Alaro\r\nflows is called Sagra, and Cramer considers that river to be the ancient\r\nSagrus.\r\n\r\n[1953] The Daunii formed only a portion of the Apuli.\r\n\r\n[1954] We have followed Kramer’s reading, τετρακοσίων ἐνενήκοντα.\r\n\r\n[1955] The ruins of Monte Dragone.\r\n\r\n[1956] Punta di Miseno.\r\n\r\n[1957] The bay of Naples.\r\n\r\n[1958] Punta della Campanella.\r\n\r\n[1959] This passage is not found in the works of Polybius, as handed\r\ndown to us.\r\n\r\n[1960] Sorrento.\r\n\r\n[1961] Torre di Patria.\r\n\r\n[1962] Liternus.\r\n\r\n[1963] Vulturnum.\r\n\r\n[1964] Venafro.\r\n\r\n[1965] Κύμη. The Greeks gave a singular form to this name of the ancient\r\nseat of the Sibyl. Her chamber, which was hewn out of the solid rock,\r\nwas destroyed when the fortress of Cumæ was besieged by Narses, who\r\nundermined it.\r\n\r\n[1966] Eusebius states that it was founded 1050 B. C., a few years\r\nbefore the great migration of the Ionians into Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[1967] We may observe that Strabo seems not to have restricted the\r\nΦλέγραιον πέδιον to that which modern geographers term the Phlegræan\r\nplains, which are contained between Cumæ and the hills bordering the\r\nLake Agnano, a little beyond Pozzuolo, but, like Pliny, to have extended\r\nit to the whole region, at present termed Terra di Lavoro.\r\n\r\n[1968] A note in the French translation observes, that Diodorus Siculus\r\n(lib. xii. § 76) places this event in the fourth year of the 89th\r\nOlympiad, 421 B. C. Livy (lib. iv. § 44) seems to place it a year later.\r\n\r\n[1969] It is now called Pineta di Castel Volturno.\r\n\r\n[1970] Forty years B. C.\r\n\r\n[1971] Punta di Miseno.\r\n\r\n[1972] Lago di Fusaro.\r\n\r\n[1973] Lago Lucrino. This lake has almost disappeared, owing to a\r\nsubterraneous eruption, which in 1538 displaced the water and raised the\r\nhill called Monte Nuovo.\r\n\r\n[1974] Lago d’ Averno.\r\n\r\n[1975] νέκυια, the title of the 11th book of the Odyssey.\r\n\r\n[1976] νεκυομαντεῖον, another title of the same (11th) book.\r\n\r\n[1977] Strabo is not the only one who mentions this: Virgil says,\r\n\r\n   “Spelunca alta fuit, vastoque immanis hiatu,\r\n   Scrupea, tuta lacu nigro, nemorumque tenebris;\r\n   Quam super haud ullæ poterant impune volantes\r\n   Tendere iter pennis; talis sese halitus atris\r\n   Faucibus effundens supera ad convexa ferebat;\r\n   Unde locum Graii dixerunt nomine Avernum.”\r\n\r\n   Æneid. vi. 237.\r\n\r\n[1978] The Greeks applied the term Plutonian to places where\r\ndisagreeable and pestilential exhalations arose.\r\n\r\n[1979]\r\n\r\n   “Nor ever does the light-giving Sun shine upon them.”\r\n\r\n   _Odys._ xi. 15.\r\n\r\n[1980] The text here appears to have been corrupted.\r\n\r\n[1981] We agree with Kramer in considering as an interpolation the\r\nwords, τε καὶ ἐπὶ Νέαν πόλιν ἐκ Δικαιαρχίας ἐπὶ ταῖς Βαΐαις, _and\r\nlikewise another at Neapolis from Dicæarchia to Baiæ_. It is generally\r\nsupposed that the Grotta di Pausilipo, or Crypta Neapolitana, is of much\r\ngreater antiquity than the Augustan age, when Cocceius flourished. There\r\nis good reason to refer that great undertaking to the Cumæi, of whose\r\nskill in works of this nature we have so remarkable an instance in the\r\ntemple of their sibyl.\r\n\r\n[1982] Dion Cassius tells us, on the contrary, that owing to the\r\nexertions of Agrippa, the gulfs both of Avernus and Lucrinus became\r\nexcellent ports, λιμένας ναυλοχωτάτους ἀπέδειξεν.\r\n\r\n[1983] Pozzuoli.\r\n\r\n[1984] La Solfa-terra.\r\n\r\n[1985] Naples.\r\n\r\n[1986] Innumerable accounts exist relative to the foundation of this\r\ncity. The most prevalent fiction was that the siren Parthenope was cast\r\nupon its shores, and from her it derived the name, by which it was\r\nusually designated by the ancient poets.\r\n\r\n   Sirenum dedit una suum memorabile nomen\r\n   Parthenope muris Acheloïas: æquore cujus\r\n   Regnavere diu cantus, quum dulce per undas\r\n   Exitium miseris caneret non prospera nautis.\r\n\r\n   _Sil. Ital._ xii. 33.\r\n\r\nScymnus of Chios mentions both the Phocæi and Cumæi as its founders.\r\nStephanus of Byzantium attributes its foundation to the Rhodians; their\r\nproximity is favourable to the claims of the Cumæi, and hence the\r\nconnexion of Naples with Eubœa, alluded to by Statius, who was born\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n   At te nascentem gremio mea prima recepit\r\n   Parthenope, dulcisque solo tu gloria nostro\r\n   Reptasti; nitidum consurgat ad æthera tellus\r\n   Eubois, et pulchra tumeat Sebethos alumna.\r\n\r\n   _Silv._ i. 2.\r\n\r\nA Greek inscription mentions a hero named Eumelus as having had divine\r\nhonours paid to him, possibly as founder of the city. [See Capaccio,\r\nHist. Nap. p. 105. Martorelli de’ Fenici primi abitatori di Napoli.]\r\nThis may illustrate the following lines,—\r\n\r\n   Di patrii, quos auguriis super æquora magnis\r\n   Littus ad Ausonium devexit Abantia classis,\r\n   Tu ductor populi longe emigrantis Apollo,\r\n   Cujus adhuc volucrem leva cervice sedentem\r\n   Respiciens blande felix Eumelis adorat.\r\n\r\n   _Silv._ iv. 8, 45.\r\n\r\n[1987] Probably those mentioned in a fragment of Timæus, quoted by\r\nTzetzes, (ad Lycophr. v. 732-737,) as having migrated to Italy under the\r\ncommand of Diotimus, who also instituted the λαμπαδηφορία, which was\r\nstill observed at Naples in the time of Statius:\r\n\r\n   Tuque Actæa Ceres, cursu cui semper anhelo\r\n   Votivam taciti quassamus lampada mystæ.\r\n\r\n   _Silv._ iv. 8, 50.\r\n\r\n[1988] Neapolis, or Naples, signifying the new city.\r\n\r\n[1989] Places of exercise for youth.\r\n\r\n[1990] Societies.\r\n\r\n[1991] Grotta di Pausilipo.\r\n\r\n[1992] Pausilypus mons was the name of the ridge of hills which\r\nseparates the bay of Naples from that of Pozzuoli. This was probably\r\ngiven to it on account of its delightful situation and aspect, which\r\nrendered it the favourite residence of several noble and wealthy Romans.\r\n\r\n[1993] Puteoli.\r\n\r\n[1994] Seneca, in describing the Crypta Neapolitana, as it was then\r\ncalled, gives an exaggerated account of the sombre horrors of the place.\r\nPerhaps in his time the apertures had become obstructed, which was\r\nevidently not the case at the time when Strabo, or the authority whom he\r\nfollows, visited the place.\r\n\r\n[1995] Hercolano, or Herculaneum, by Cicero (to Atticus, vii. 3) called\r\nHerculanum. It is probable that the subversion of this town was not\r\nsudden, but progressive, since Seneca mentions a partial demolition\r\nwhich it sustained from an earthquake. (_Nat. Quæst._ vi. 1.) So many\r\nbooks have been written on the antiquities and works of art discovered\r\nin Herculaneum, that the subject need not be enlarged upon here.\r\n\r\n[1996] Several inscriptions in Oscan, and Etruscan, characters have been\r\ndiscovered in the ruins of Herculaneum. Lanzi, (tom. iii.,)—Romanelli\r\nViaggio a Pompei ed Ercolano.\r\n\r\n[1997] Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[1998] The ancient Sarnus.\r\n\r\n[1999] These Pelasgi were established among the Tyrrhenians.\r\n\r\n[2000] It is believed that the Samnites possessed both places, 310, B.\r\nC.\r\n\r\n[2001] The Romans must have been masters of these cities 272, B. C.\r\n(Livy, Epit. xiv.)\r\n\r\n[2002] Nola resisted, under the able direction of Marcellus, all the\r\nefforts of Hannibal after the battle of Cannæ. A remarkable inscription\r\nin Oscan characters relative to this town is explained by Lanzi, (tom.\r\niii. 612,) its name is there written NUFLA.

See\r\nHolsten. Adnot. p. 248; Romanelli, tom. iii. p. 619. Virgil, Æn. v. 864,\r\ndescribes them as,\r\n\r\n   Jamque adeo scopulos advecta subibat;\r\n   Difficiles quondam, multorumque ossibus albos.\r\n\r\nIt had been decreed that the Sirens should live only till some one\r\nhearing their song should pass on unmoved, and Orpheus, who accompanied\r\nthe Argonauts, having surpassed the Sirens, and led on the ship, they\r\ncast themselves into the sea, and were metamorphosed into these rocks.\r\n\r\n[2007] The bay of Naples.\r\n\r\n[2008] Punta di Miseno.\r\n\r\n[2009] Procida.\r\n\r\n[2010] Ischia.\r\n\r\n[2011] It appears that Hiero the First is here alluded to; he ascended\r\nthe throne 478 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2012] The volcanos of Sicily, Lipari, Pithecussæ, _or_ Ischia, and\r\nMount Vesuvius. See Humboldt (Cosmos i. 238, _note_).\r\n\r\n[2013] We, in common with the French translators and Siebenkees, have\r\nadopted the νήσους found in the MS. of Peter Bembo, and some others\r\ncited by Casaubon.\r\n\r\n[2014] Pindar Pyth.

It was one of the most ancient and important cities of\r\nCampania; though situated in an open plain, it resisted all the efforts\r\nof Hannibal after the battle of Cannæ.

The Paris\r\nmanuscript, No. 1393, reads κανίαν.\r\n\r\n[2060] Pliny, in his Natural History, (lib. ii. § 106,) has confirmed\r\nStrabo’s account. It appears from Cluvier that the people who inhabit\r\nthe banks of the Silaro are not acquainted with any circumstances which\r\nmight corroborate the statement. (Cluvier, Ital. Ant. lib. iv. c. 14.)\r\n\r\n[2061] About B. C. 201.\r\n\r\n[2062] The ancient Silaris.\r\n\r\n[2063] Pesti.\r\n\r\n[2064] It is now called Licosa, and sometimes Isola piana; several\r\nvestiges of buildings were discovered on the island in 1696. Antonin.\r\ndella Lucan. p. ii. disc. 8.\r\n\r\n[2065] Capo della Licosa.\r\n\r\n[2066] Punta della Campanella.\r\n\r\n[2067] Golfo di Salerno.\r\n\r\n[2068] Strabo here cites the historian Antiochus, but it is surprising\r\nthat he does not rather cite the writer from whom Antiochus seems to\r\nhave borrowed this account, we mean Herodotus, who relates it (lib. i. §\r\n164). But Strabo, probably, looking upon Herodotus as a collector of\r\nfables, chose rather to yield to the authority of Antiochus, who had\r\nwritten very accurate memoirs upon Italy, and who was, likewise, himself\r\na very ancient author, (Dion. Halicarn. Antiq. Rom. lib. i. § 12,) and\r\nflourished about 420 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2069] Or Velia, founded 532 B. C., mentioned by Horace, Epist. I. xv.\r\n1, “Quæ sit hyems Veliæ, quod cœlum, Vala, Salerni.”\r\n\r\n[2070] The modern Alento.\r\n\r\n[2071] Now unknown.\r\n\r\n[2072] Pliny affirms that these two islands were called, the one Pontia,\r\nthe other Ischia; “Contra Veliam Pontia et Ischia, utræque uno nomine\r\nŒnotrides, argumentum possessæ ab Œnotriis Italiæ.” Hist. Nat. lib. iii.\r\n§ 13. If this reading be not faulty, Pliny will have placed in the\r\nlatitude, of which our author is now giving a description, a small\r\nisland bearing the same name, _Pontia_, as the island lying off Cape\r\nMisenum.\r\n\r\n[2073] The Buxentum of the Latins.\r\n\r\n[2074] 471 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2075] Gulf of Policastro.\r\n\r\n[2076] Now the river Laino.\r\n\r\n[2077] Called Laino in the time of Cluverius. Lib. iv. cap. 14.\r\n\r\n[2078] Upon this coast.\r\n\r\n[2079] Founded about the year 510 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2080] About the year 390 before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2081] i. e. the Gulf of Tarentum.\r\n\r\n[2082] Strabo seems here to distinguish the Chones from the Œnotri, and\r\nthe Œnotri from the Greeks. According to Cluvier (Ital. Antiq. cap. 16,\r\np. 1323) here was a double error: “not only (says he) Aristotle, but\r\nAntiochus, according to Strabo’s own testimony, positively affirmed that\r\nthe Chones and Œnotri were one and the same nation, and Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassius (Antiq. Roman. lib. i. § 11) makes no doubt that the\r\nŒnotri were of Greek origin.” But Mazochi justifies the distinction\r\nbetween the Chones and the Œnotri, and shows cause to doubt that the\r\nŒnotri were of Greek origin.\r\n\r\n[2083] ἐκβεβαρβαρῶσθαι. We think with Mazochi (Prodrom. ad Heracl.\r\npseph. diatrib. 2, cap. 7, sect. 2) that, by the above word, Strabo\r\nprobably expressed that, at the time when he wrote, Tarentum, Rheggio,\r\nand Naples were the only cities founded by the Greeks in Italy, which,\r\nalthough become Roman, retained the language, laws, and usages of their\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\n[2084] It has been well observed by Cramer in his Ancient Italy, that\r\nStrabo confused this Petilia of the Leucani with another better known of\r\nthe Bruttii, the foundation of which was attributed to Philoctetes. It\r\nis observed by Antonini that Strabo contradicts himself, by ascribing to\r\nPhiloctetes the origin of a town in Leucania, for he states a few lines\r\nfurther on that that hero occupied a part of the coast near Crotona,\r\nwhich was in the territory of the Bruttii. Strabo’s account, however, of\r\nthe existence of a Leucanian Petilia is confirmed by many inscriptions\r\nof early date. The ruins of the town remain on the Monte della Stella.\r\nAntonin. della Lucan. p. i. disc. 8. Romanelli, tom. i. p. 350.\r\n\r\n[2085] According to some judicious antiquaries, the site of Chone is\r\nlocated at Casabuona, near Strongoli.\r\n\r\n[2086] Trapani del Monte.\r\n\r\n[2087] The ruins of this city, which was anciently called also Egesta,\r\nAcesta, and Segesta, may be seen at Barbara, in the valley of Mazzara.\r\n\r\n[2088] Kramer, following the suggestion of Xylander, has printed\r\nΓρουμεντὸν. I am inclined, however, to think that Πουμεντὸν, the reading\r\nof Manuscripts, is correct. According to Barrio, it occupied the\r\nsituation of Gerenza, on the right bank of the Nieto.\r\n\r\n[2089] Verzine on the Nieto. (Barr. lib. iv. cap. 18. Maraf. lib. iii.\r\nc. 18.)\r\n\r\n[2090] Calasarna is supposed by the Calabrian topographers to accord\r\nwith the site of Campania.\r\n\r\n[2091] Venosa, situated about 15 miles south of the Aufidus. It was a\r\ncolony of importance before the war against Pyrrhus. After the disaster\r\nat Cannæ, it afforded a retreat to Varro and the few who escaped that\r\nsignal overthrow. Horace was born there in the year of the city 688.\r\nAbout six miles from Venosa, on the site named Palazzo, was the Fons\r\nBandusiæ. (Chaupy, Des c. de la maison de Camp. d’Horace, tom. iii. p.\r\n538.)\r\n\r\n[2092] Cluvier thought that we should read Θουριανὴ instead of Ταυριανὴ.\r\n\r\n[2093] Laos, now Lao.\r\n\r\n[2094] Torre di Mare.\r\n\r\n[2095] Golfo di S. Eufemia.\r\n\r\n[2096] Golfo di Squillace. Scylletium was once a Greek city of note,\r\ncommunicating its name to the gulf. Servius observes that the Athenians\r\nwho founded the colony were returning from Africa. There was a Greek\r\ninscription found in 1791 relative to the Λαμπαδηδρομία, which seems to\r\nconfirm the tradition of the Athenian origin of Scylletium. It was the\r\nbirth-place of Cassiodorus.\r\n\r\n[2097] Σίλαρις. The Silaro, which, divides Lucania from Campania, takes\r\nits rise in the Apennines, in a district which formerly belonged to the\r\nHirpini; and after receiving the Tanager, now Negro, and the Calor, now\r\nCalore, falls into the Gulf of Salerno. Silius Italicus (viii. 582)\r\nstates that this river possessed the property of incrusting twigs with a\r\ncalcareous deposit:\r\n\r\n   “Nunc Silarus quos nutrit aquis, quo gurgite tradunt\r\n   Duritiem lapidum mersis inolescere ramis.”\r\n\r\nAt its mouth was a haven named Portus Albernus.\r\n\r\n[2098] Torre di Mare.\r\n\r\n[2099] Cirella.\r\n\r\n[2100] This measure, upon our charts, is 330 Olympic stadia. Gosselin.\r\n\r\n[2101] Golfo di Squillace.\r\n\r\n[2102] The Golfo di S. Eufemia.\r\n\r\n[2103] ἐξεταραξεν ἅπαντας πρὸς ἅπαντας. Lit. “He stirred up every body\r\nagainst every body.” It is conceived that the hostilities of the Bruttii\r\nwere fomented by Dion in order to prevent the tyrant Dionysius from\r\nderiving any aid from his Leucanian allies. The advancement of the\r\nBruttii to independence is computed by Diodorus Siculus to have taken\r\nplace about 397 years after the foundation of Rome, that is, 356 before\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2104] The situation of Temesa has not yet been fully determined.\r\nCluverius fixes it about ten miles south of Amantea, near Torre Loppa.\r\nRomanelli observes, however, that Cluverius has not allowed for the\r\ndifference between the ancient and modern computation of distance. To\r\nrectify this oversight, he makes choice of Torre del piano del Casale,\r\nnearly two miles north of Torre Loppa, as the locality of this ancient\r\nsite. The silver coins of Temesa are scarce. They have the Greek\r\nepigraph, ΤΕΜ.\r\n\r\n[2105] After the second Punic war it was colonized by the Romans, who\r\ncalled it Tempsa, B. C. 195.\r\n\r\n[2106] We concur with Kramer in approving the proposition of Groskurd to\r\nunderstand the words ἐκεῖνον μὲν οὖν διὰ πολλοῦ as having been\r\noriginally written in the text immediately before ἐπικεῖσθαι αὐτοῖς.\r\n\r\n[2107] They had been compelled to sacrifice a virgin annually in order\r\nto appease his disturbed spirit.\r\n\r\n[2108] Borgo di Tamasso.\r\n\r\n[2109] These words in parenthesis seem to have been interpolated by the\r\ntranscribers of our author. Both Temesa and Tamassus were rich in metal,\r\nbut the spelling of the name in Homer is more in accordance with Temesa\r\nthan Tamassus, and other poets have alluded to it, as Ovid. Met. xv.\r\n706,\r\n\r\n   “Evincitque fretum, Siculique angusta Pelori,\r\n   Hippotadæque domos regis, Temesesque metalla.”\r\n\r\nAnd Fast. v. 441,\r\n\r\n   “... Temesæaque concrepat æra.”\r\n\r\nAnd Statius, Silv. i. 42,\r\n\r\n   “Et cui se toties Temese dedit hausta metallis.”\r\n\r\n[2110] Odyssey i. 184.\r\n\r\n[2111] Nocera.\r\n\r\n[2112] Hannibal took refuge in Calabria about 209 years before the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\n[2113] Cosenza, near the source of the Crathis, now Crati, represents\r\nCosentia. It was taken by Hannibal after the surrender of Petilia, but\r\ntowards the end of the war the Romans regained it.\r\n\r\n[2114]\r\n\r\n   Αἰακίδη, προφύλαξο μολεῖν Ἀχερούσιον ὕδωρ\r\n   Πανδοσίην θ’, ὅθι τοι θάνατος πεπρωμένος ἐστί.\r\n\r\nSon of Æacus, beware of approaching the Acherusian water and Pandosia,\r\nwhere death is destined for thee.\r\n\r\n[2115] About B. C. 330.\r\n\r\n[2116] Commentators generally agree that this is the Pandosia memorable\r\nfor the defeat and death of Alexander, king of Epirus. The early\r\nCalabrian antiquaries have placed it at Castel Franco. D’Anville, in his\r\nmap, lays it down near Lao and Cirella. Modern investigators have sought\r\nits ruins near Mendocino, between Cosenza and the sea, a hill with three\r\nsummits having been remarked there, which answers to the fatal height\r\npointed out by the oracle,\r\n\r\n   Πανδοσία τρικόλωνε, πολύν ποτε λαὸν ὀλέσσεις·\r\n\r\ntogether with a rivulet, Maresanto or Arconti; which last name recalls\r\nthe Acheron denounced by another prediction, as so inauspicious to the\r\nMolossian king. Scylax, in his Periplus, seems to place Pandosia,\r\ntogether with Clampetia and Terina, near the western coast.\r\n\r\n[2117] Afterwards Vibo Valentia, now Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n[2118] Surnamed the Epizephyrii. Heyne supposes this took place B. C.\r\n388.\r\n\r\n[2119] B. C. 193.\r\n\r\n[2120] There was a temple erected to Proserpine in these meadows, and a\r\nbuilding called “Amalthæa’s horn,” raised by Gelon of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[2121] The present harbour of Bivona.\r\n\r\n[2122] He reigned from B. C. 317 to B. C. 289.\r\n\r\n[2123] Now Le Formicole. The promontory named Capo Vaticano seems to\r\nhave been anciently known under the same appellation.\r\n\r\n[2124] Medma, or Mesma, was situated on the right bank of the river\r\nMesima, which seems to retain traces of the name of the ancient city.\r\nAntiquaries report that its ruins are seen between Nicotera and the\r\nriver Mesima. The epigraph on the coins of this city is generally ΜΕΣΜΑ,\r\nor ΜΕΣΜΑΙΩΝ, and in a single instance ΜΕΔΑΜΑ.\r\n\r\n[2125] That is, the Epizephyrian Locrians.\r\n\r\n[2126] Cluverius considers this to be the modern Bagnara.\r\n\r\n[2127] The ancient river Metaurus is now also called Marro, and\r\nsometimes Petrace. It was noted for the excellence of the thunny fish\r\ncaught at its mouth.\r\n\r\n[2128] Metaurum. The site of this place is supposed to accord with that\r\nof the town of Gioja.\r\n\r\n[2129] Homer, Odyssey, lib. x.\r\n\r\n[2130] There have been many suggestions for the correction of this\r\npassage. Kramer thinks that Cluverius was happy in proposing Ποταμὸς\r\ninstead of Μέταυρος, and that then the Cratais, now Solano, or Fiume de’\r\nPesci, would be the river which Strabo intended.\r\n\r\n[2131] According to Pliny, these two promontories were separated by an\r\ninterval of twelve stadia, or a mile and a half, which accords with the\r\nstatement of Polybius. Thucydides, however, allows about two miles and a\r\nhalf, which he considers to be the utmost possible distance.\r\nTopographers are divided as to the exact point of the Italian coast\r\nwhich answers to Cape Cænys. The Calabrian geographers say the Punta del\r\nPezzo, called also Coda del Volpe, in which opinion Cluverius and\r\nD’Anville coincide, but Holstenius contends for the Torre del Cavallo,\r\nwhich the French translators seem to favour. In fact, that may be the\r\nnarrowest point, still it does not answer so well to Strabo’s\r\ndescription of the figure and bearing of Cape Cænys as the Punta del\r\nPezzo.\r\n\r\n[2132] The temple or altar of Neptune.\r\n\r\n[2133] The Columna Rhegina, as remarked by Cramer, (vol. ii. p. 427,)\r\nwas probably a pillar set up to mark the consular road leading to the\r\nsouth of Italy. Strabo speaks of it as a small tower (book iii. c. v. §\r\n5, p. 265). In the Itinerary of Antoninus it is simply termed Columna,\r\nbut in the inscription relative to the Via Aquilia, it is called Statua.\r\nThe situation of this tower is generally identified with the site of La\r\nCatona.\r\n\r\n[2134] Now Reggio, one of the most celebrated and flourishing cities of\r\nMagna Grecia, founded about 696 years B. C. Cato affirms that it was\r\nonce in the possession of the Aurunci. The connexion which subsisted\r\nbetween Rhegium and the Chalcidian colonies in Sicily, induced its\r\ninhabitants to take part with the Athenians in their first hostilities\r\nagainst the Syracusans and Locrians. In the great Sicilian expedition,\r\nthe Rhegians observed a strict neutrality. While the Athenian fleet was\r\nmoored in their roads, they refused to admit the army within their\r\nwalls, which therefore encamped near the temple of Diana outside the\r\ntown. Rhegium subsequently pursued a similar policy, and suffered\r\nseverely under tyrants, but the Roman senate at length freed the\r\nunfortunate citizens.\r\n\r\n[2135] Strabo here alludes to the crime which was perpetrated in the\r\nreign of Teleclus, about 811 years before the Christian era. The\r\ndivision of the Messenians into two parties, the one wishing and the\r\nother refusing to give satisfaction, lasted about 150 years. See book\r\nvi. cap. iii. § 3.\r\n\r\n[2136] It was taken by the Lacedæmonians about B. C. 668.\r\n\r\n[2137] It seems probable that Strabo here refers to Morgantium in\r\nSicily, which had disappeared in his days, and which he mentions in b.\r\nvi. c. 11. § 4.\r\n\r\n[2138] Sextus Pompeius, having received from the senate the command of\r\nthe fleet, B. C. 43, in a short time made himself master of Sicily,\r\nwhich he held till 36.\r\n\r\n[2139] This is a quotation from one of the missing works of Æschylus.\r\n\r\n[2140] Virgil speaks of this great catastrophe, Æn. iii. 414,\r\n\r\n   “Hæc loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruina\r\n   (Tantum ævi longinqua valet mutare vetustas,)\r\n   Dissiluisse ferunt: cum protinus utraque tellus\r\n   Una foret, venit medio vi pontus, et undis\r\n   Hesperium Siculo latus abscidit: arvaque et urbes\r\n   Litore diductas angusto interluit æstu.”\r\n\r\n[2141] Procida.\r\n\r\n[2142] It appears from the more ancient coins of Rhegium, that the\r\noriginal name was RECION. In these the epigraph is REC. RECI. RECINOS,\r\nin characters partaking more of the Oscan than the Greek form; those of\r\nmore recent date are decidedly Greek, ΡΗΓ. ΡΗΓΙΝΩΝ, being inscribed on\r\nthem. A note in the French translation shows that the inhabitants of\r\nRhegium did not participate in the rights of Roman citizens till about\r\n90 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[2143] Among these were many followers of Pythagoras, also Theagenes,\r\nHippys, Lycus surnamed Butera, and Glaucus, who were historians; Ibycus,\r\nCleomenes, and Lycus the adoptive father of Lycophron, who were poets;\r\nClearchus and Pythagoras, who were sculptors.\r\n\r\n[2144] The Rhegians firmly opposed the designs of this tyrant; and when,\r\nunder pretence of courting their alliance, he sought a consort from\r\ntheir city, they replied with independent feeling that he might have\r\ntheir hangman’s daughter. (See Diodorus Siculus, xiv. 44.) Had the other\r\nstates of Magna Grecia displayed the same energy, the ambitious views of\r\nthis artful prince might have been frustrated; but after the defeat of\r\ntheir forces on the Elleporus, now Callipari, they succumbed, and\r\nRhegium, after a gallant defence which lasted nearly a year, was\r\ncompelled to yield, about the year 398 B. C. The insulting tyrant\r\nsentenced the heroic Phyton, who had commanded the town, to a cruel\r\ndeath, and removed the few inhabitants that remained to Sicily.\r\n\r\n[2145] B. C. 360.\r\n\r\n[2146] B. C. 280.\r\n\r\n[2147] B. C. 91.\r\n\r\n[2148] The defeat of Sextus Pompeius is referred to the year 36 B. C.,\r\nbut there is no precise date mentioned for the establishment of the\r\nveteran soldiers in Rhegium, which probably took place about the year 31\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n[2149] Pliny computes the distance from Rhegium to Cape Leucopetra at 12\r\nmiles; there is probably some error in the text, as there is no cape\r\nwhich corresponds with the distance of 50 stadia from Rhegium. A note in\r\nthe French translation proposes to read 100 instead of 50 stadia.\r\nTopographers are not agreed in fixing the situation of the celebrated\r\nLeucopetra. D’Anville places it at Capo Pittaro, Grimaldi at the Punta\r\ndella Saetta, and Cluverius, Holstenius, and Cellarius at the Capo\r\ndell’Armi. This latter opinion seems more compatible with the statement\r\nof Pliny, and is also more generally accredited.\r\n\r\n[2150] The Herculeum Promontorium is known in modern geography as Capo\r\nSpartivento.\r\n\r\n[2151] The Promontorium Iapygium, or Sallentinum, as it was sometimes\r\ncalled, formed a remarkable feature in the figure of Italy, while the\r\nart of navigation was in its infancy. It was a conspicuous landmark to\r\nmariners bound from the ports of Greece to Sicily. The fleets of Athens,\r\nafter having circumnavigated the Peloponnesus, usually made for Corcyra,\r\nwhence they steered straight across to the promontory, and then coasted\r\nalong the south of Italy. It seems from Thucydides (vi. 44) that there\r\nwas a haven here which afforded a shelter to vessels in tempestuous\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[2152] Now Capo di Bruzzano.\r\n\r\n[2153] The one 710, the other 734 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2154] The opinion of Ephorus seems to be supported by many other\r\nwriters, and is generally preferred by modern critics.\r\n\r\n[2155] Monte Esope.\r\n\r\n[2156] This wicked prince, having been expelled from Syracuse, had found\r\nrefuge among the Locrians from the storm which threatened his existence;\r\nbut, depraved as he was degraded, he repaid the kindness of the people,\r\nwho treated him as their kinsman because his mother Doris had been the\r\ndaughter of one of their principal citizens, with the basest treachery\r\nand ingratitude. He introduced into their city a number of miscreants,\r\nand having overpowered the inhabitants, gave loose to all the vicious\r\npropensities of his nature.\r\n\r\n[2157] Horrid as is the vengeance which the Locri took on these\r\nunfortunate victims of a husband’s and a father’s crimes, it serves to\r\nconfirm the accounts of the iniquity and barbarity of a prince, whose\r\nmean and imbecile conduct at other times sanctions the notion that his\r\nintellect was disordered.\r\n\r\n[2158] We could almost wish to read this passage—“rendered them more\r\nplausible, but impaired their utility.”\r\n\r\n[2159] The ancient Halex.\r\n\r\n[2160] Although Strabo ascribes Mamertium to the Bruttii, it is more\r\nprobable that it was a colony of Campanian mercenaries, deriving their\r\nname from Mamers, the Oscan Mars, who served under Agathocles, and other\r\nprinces of Sicily. The Mamertini were employed by the Romans against\r\nPyrrhus, whom they attacked in the woods and defiles about Rhegium.\r\nBarrio (lib. ii. c. 10) and Maraf. (lib. iii. c. 25, f. 222) have\r\nidentified the site of this ancient town with Martorano, but it seems\r\ntoo distant from Locri and Rhegium to accord with Strabo’s description.\r\nCluverius, D’Anville, and Romanelli place it at Oppido, a bishop’s see\r\nabove Reggio, and Gerace, where old coins are said to have been\r\ndiscovered. Cramer (vol. ii. p. 439) thinks that the Melæ mentioned by\r\nThucydides may have been identical with Mamertium. Several remains of\r\nantiquity exist on the site called Mela, in the vicinity of Oppido.\r\n\r\n[2161] The pix Bruttia is noticed by Pliny, Columella, Dioscorides, and\r\nother authorities mentioned by Bochart, Canaan, p. 595. Bochart looks\r\nupon the Bruttii as a people known to the Phœnicians at a very remote\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[2162] Geographers differ much as to the modern river which corresponds\r\nto this stream. Romanelli and Swinburne consider it to be the Alaro.\r\n\r\n[2163] During the war against Pyrrhus, whose cause was espoused by\r\nCaulonia, the city was pillaged by the Mamertini, the allies of the\r\nRomans. The town was subsequently occupied by the Bruttii, who defended\r\nit against the Romans in the second Punic war. Barrio and other\r\nCalabrian topographers have fixed its site at Castro Vetere, but Strabo\r\nplaced it on the left bank of the Sagras, which is inconsistent with\r\ntheir supposition, and it is still a subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\n[2164] Cluvier (Sicil. ant. lib. ii.) reckons this place was situated\r\nbetween Caltanis and Pietrapreccia.\r\n\r\n[2165] Now Squillace.\r\n\r\n[2166] Servius observes that these Athenians were returning from Africa,\r\nServ. Æn. iii. 552.\r\n\r\n[2167] Saumaise (Exercit. Plin. p. 47, 57) thinks the true reading\r\nshould be Scylaceium, or Virgil could not have made the penultimate\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n   ... Attollit se diva Lacinia contra\r\n   Caulonisque arces, et navifragum Scylaceum. Æn. iii. 652.\r\n\r\n[2168] About B. C. 389.\r\n\r\n[2169] Book vi. cap. i. § 4.\r\n\r\n[2170] Pliny seems to attribute to Dionysius the elder the project of\r\ncutting not walling off the isthmus: “Itaque Dionysius major intercisam\r\neo loco adjicere Siciliæ voluit.” Hist. Nat. lib. iii. § 15. Grimaldi\r\nalso is of opinion that the circumstance mentioned by Strabo should be\r\nreferred to the first years of Dionysius the younger, about B. C.\r\n366-359.\r\n\r\n[2171] By those who dwelt without, Strabo doubtless intended the\r\nCrotoniatæ, and their allies.\r\n\r\n[2172] These three capes are now called Capo delle Castella, Capo\r\nRizzuto, and Capo della Nave.\r\n\r\n[2173] Lacinium was about six miles from Crotona. The celebrated temple\r\nof Juno derived its name from the promontory. According to Diodorus\r\nSiculus, some ascribe its origin to Hercules. (Diod. Sic. iv. 24.) Its\r\nruins are in the early Doric style, with fluted pillars broader at the\r\nbase than at the capital. It measured about 132 yards in length, and 66\r\nin breadth. Its principal entrance opened to the west.\r\n\r\n[2174] Gosselin follows the opinion that Polybius wrote 1300 stadia.\r\n\r\n[2175] The Strait of Sicily.\r\n\r\n[2176] The modern names of Cape Lacinium, viz. Capo delle Colonne and\r\nCapo Nao, are derived from the remains of the temple, which is still\r\nvisible on its summit.\r\n\r\n[2177] The text is here evidently deficient. Groskurd says that Strabo\r\nmost probably wrote as follows, “As the chorographer says, Artemidorus\r\nreckons that [the journey would take 12 days for one travelling on\r\nfoot], with his girdle on; [but, to one sailing, the distance is 2000\r\nstadia:] leaving at the same time as many [for the mouth, as Polybius\r\nhas given] for the breadth of the mouth of the gulf.” The French\r\ntranslators, however, have attempted to read the text as follows, “The\r\nchorographer makes it 240 miles, and Artemidorus says that it is 380 for\r\na light traveller; a computation in which the breadth of the mouth is\r\nnot included;” but comment on it in several extensive notes.\r\n\r\n[2178] South-east.\r\n\r\n[2179] The ancient Æsar.\r\n\r\n[2180] Groskurd observes, Im Texte καὶ λιμὴν. Besser also, liest man mit\r\n_Cluv._ λίμνη, and translates it “a salt-marsh;” but Cramer, in his\r\ndescription of ancient Italy, observes that the mouth of the river Esaro\r\nformed a haven, which, however incommodious compared with those of\r\nTarentum and Brundusium, was long a source of great wealth to Crotona,\r\nas we are assured by Polybius, Frag. x. 1.\r\n\r\n[2181] Neæthus. This river was said to derive its name from the\r\ncircumstance of the captive Trojan women having there set fire to the\r\nGrecian fleet.\r\n\r\n[2182] Νέαιθος, from νῆας and αἰθεῖν, “to burn the ships.”\r\n\r\n[2183] There is much obscurity in this oracular response. The various\r\nmanuscripts offer many readings.\r\n\r\n[2184] A note in the French translation observes that the establishment\r\nof Myscellus at Crotona took place about 709 or 703 years B. C., and\r\nthat Syracuse was founded as early as 735 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2185] According to some traditions, Crotona was very ancient, and\r\nderived its name from the hero Croto. Thus Ovid:\r\n\r\n   “Vixque pererratis quæ spectant littora terris,\r\n   Invenit Æsarei fatalia fluminis ora:\r\n   Nec procul hinc tumulum, sub quo sacrata Crotonis\r\n   Ossa tegebat humus. Jussaque ibi mœnia terra\r\n   Condidit; et nomen tumulati traxit in urbem.”\r\n\r\n   Ovid. Metam. xv. 53.\r\n\r\n[2186] Milo is said to have carried off the prize for wrestling from the\r\n62nd Olympiad, B. C. 532, and also to have commanded the 100,000\r\nCrotoniatæ who engaged the hostile armies of Sybaris and destroyed their\r\ncity, about B. C. 509. Diod. Sic. xii. 9, &c.\r\n\r\n[2187] Sybaris was said to have been founded by the people of Trœzene\r\nnot long after the siege of Troy. Aristot. Politic. lib. v. cap. 3.\r\nSolin. viii. But these were subsequently joined by a more numerous\r\ncolony of Achæans, about B. C. 720. Euseb. Chron. ii.\r\n\r\n[2188] ὁ Κρᾶθις. There was a stream of the same name in Achaia, from\r\nwhence the Italian Crathis, now Crati, derived its name. The Crathis and\r\nSybaris now join about 14 miles from the sea.\r\n\r\n[2189] Now Cochile.\r\n\r\n[2190] Koray objected to the old reading, ὁ Ἰσελικεὺς, and proposed\r\ninstead Οἰς.... Ἑλικεὺς; Groskurd thought it better to translate it Ihr\r\nErbauer war Is ... aus Helike; and Kramer has adopted this latter\r\nview, which we have followed.\r\n\r\n[2191] Helice was mentioned, book i. chap. iii. § 18. Ovid, Metam. xv.\r\n293, also speaks of this city,\r\n\r\n   “Si quæras Helicen et Buram Achaïdas urbes,\r\n   Invenies sub aquis....”\r\n\r\n[2192] The Epitome gives nine days.\r\n\r\n[2193] The events which led to this catastrophe are thus related by\r\nDiodorus Siculus: “A democratical party, at the head of which was Telys,\r\nhaving gained the ascendency, expelled 500 of the principal citizens,\r\nwho sought refuge at Crotona. This city, upon receiving a summons to\r\ngive up the fugitives, or prepare for war, by the advice of Pythagoras\r\nchose the latter. The armies met near the river Triunti, in the\r\nterritory of Crotona, where the brave citizens gained a complete\r\nvictory.”\r\n\r\n[2194] At the instigation of Pericles, the Athenians sent out a colony\r\nunder the command of Lampon and Xenocritus, which arrived about 55 years\r\nafter the overthrow of Sybaris. Two celebrated characters are named\r\namong those who joined this expedition, which was collected from\r\ndifferent parts of Greece. These were Herodotus, and Lysias the orator.\r\n\r\n[2195] Compare Ælian. Hist. Anim. ii. 36.\r\n\r\n[2196] From B. C. 390 to 290.\r\n\r\n[2197] About B. C. 194.\r\n\r\n[2198] Cæsar however calls it Thurii, and designates it a municipal\r\ntown. Civ. Bell. iii. 22.\r\n\r\n[2199] Now La Nucara.\r\n\r\n[2200] It is not ascertained whether this leader were the architect of\r\nthe Horse of Troy.\r\n\r\n[2201] Antiquaries seem agreed in fixing the site of this town at\r\nPolicoro, about three miles from the mouth of the Agri, where\r\nconsiderable remains are still visible. The city is famous as the seat\r\nof the general council of the Greek states, and the celebrated bronze\r\ntables on which the learned Mazzocchi bestowed so much labour were\r\ndiscovered near its site. Its coins represent Hercules contending with\r\nthe lion, and bear the epigraph ΗΡΑ or HÊRAKLÊIÔN.\r\n\r\n[2202] Ἄκιρις.\r\n\r\n[2203] Σῖρις.\r\n\r\n[2204] This accords very well with the distance given in the Itinerary\r\nof Antoninus.\r\n\r\n[2205] About B. C. 580.\r\n\r\n[2206] Kramer reads χώνων in the text. We have followed the opinion of\r\nthe French translators, who have rendered it “possédée par des Troyens.”\r\nMSS. give various readings.\r\n\r\n[2207] Kramer reads ἐπὶ Τεύθραντος, but thinks with Groskurd that ἐπὶ\r\nτοῦ Τράεντος, the Traens or modern Trionto, is the true reading.\r\n\r\n[2208] About B. C. 444.\r\n\r\n[2209] About B. C. 433.\r\n\r\n[2210] In the time of Pausanias, this city was a heap of ruins, and\r\nnothing remained standing but the walls and theatre. Considerable\r\nvestiges, situated near the station called Torre di Mare, indicate the\r\nsite it anciently adorned.\r\n\r\n[2211] θέρος χρυσοῦν. Xylander and others have thought this was a statue\r\nrepresenting Summer; others have reckoned that golden sheaves were\r\nintended. The coins of Metapontium, which are greatly admired as works\r\nof art, have a head of Ceres, and on the reverse an ear of corn. A large\r\nsum of these might be justly called a golden harvest.\r\n\r\n[2212] Neleus had twelve sons, eleven of whom were slain by Hercules,\r\nwhile Nestor alone escaped; we must therefore infer from this passage,\r\nthat rites were celebrated at Metapontium in honour of his brothers.\r\n\r\n[2213] The Greek words might either mean that Metapontium was destroyed\r\nor that the sacrifices were abolished. From the succeeding sentence it\r\nwould be most natural to suppose that Strabo meant to say the city was\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\n[2214] These words are not in the Greek text, but seem to have been\r\naccidentally omitted by the transcriber.\r\n\r\n[2215] A city of Phocis, now Krisso.\r\n\r\n[2216] The ordinary reading is Trinacis, but Kramer found it given\r\nThrinacia in the Vatican Manuscript, No. 482, which seems to suit the\r\nrest of the sentence better. Dionysius Perieg. vers. 467, says,\r\n\r\n   Τρινακίη δ’ ἐπὶ τῇσιν, ὑπὲρ πέδον Αὐσονιήων\r\n   Ἐκτέταται.\r\n\r\nAnd Homer, Strabo’s great geographical authority, in book xi. of the\r\nOdyssey, line 106, terms it Θρινακίῃ νήσῳ. Virgil, Æn. iii. 440, says,\r\n\r\n   “Trinacria fines Italos mittere relicta.”\r\n\r\n[2217] Capo Passaro.\r\n\r\n[2218] Capo di Marsalla, or Capo Boeo.\r\n\r\n[2219] The south-west.\r\n\r\n[2220] Milazzo.\r\n\r\n[2221] S. Maria di Tindaro.\r\n\r\n[2222] The MSS. of Strabo read Agathyrsum, but the town is more commonly\r\ncalled Agathyrnum. Livy, book xxvi. cap. 40, and Silius Italicus, book\r\nxiv. ver. 260, call it Agathyrna. Cluverius considers it to have been\r\nsituated near S. Marco; others would place it nearer to Capo d’ Orlando;\r\nwhile D’Anville is in favour of Agati.\r\n\r\n[2223] I Bagni, or S. Maria de’ Palazzi. Groskurd gives it as Torre di\r\nPittineo by Tusa, or Torre di Tusa. Cicero writes the name without a\r\ndiphthong, “statim Messana litteras Halesam mittit.” Cic. in Verr. ii.\r\nc. 7. Diodorus spells it Ἄλεσα. Silius Italicus, lib. xiv. ver. 219,\r\nmakes the penultimate long:\r\n\r\n   “Venit ab amne trahens nomen Gela, venit Halæsa.”\r\n\r\nAnd the inscription in Gruter, p. 212, gives the name of the river near\r\nit, Αλαισος.\r\n\r\n[2224] Cefalù.\r\n\r\n[2225] Modern critics consider this to be the Fiume-Grande, which takes\r\nits rise near Polizzi and the Fiume Salso, the latter flows from a\r\nsource within a few miles of the Fiume-Grande, and after a course of\r\nabout 80 miles, falls into the sea near Alicata. The Fiume Salso was\r\nalso called Himera, and both rivers taken to be one.\r\n\r\n[2226] Palermo.\r\n\r\n[2227] Castel-à-Mare.\r\n\r\n[2228] Capo Boeo.\r\n\r\n[2229] Probably ruins at the embouchure of the Platani. Groskurd also\r\ngives for it Bissenza.\r\n\r\n[2230] At the mouth of the Fiume di Girgenti. Virgil calls Agrigentum by\r\nthe Greek name, Æn. iii. 703,\r\n\r\n   “Arduus inde Acragas ostentat maxima longe\r\n   Mœnia, magnanimûm quondam generator equorum.”\r\n\r\n[2231] As the distance from Agrigentum to Camarina greatly exceeds\r\nanother 20 miles, Kramer supposes that the words, “and to Gela, 20,”\r\nhave been omitted by the copyist.\r\n\r\n[2232] Torre di Camarana.\r\n\r\n[2233] The Paris MS. No. 1393, used by the French translators, has 33;\r\nthe Paris MS. 1396, and the Medici plut. 28, No. 5, give 20 miles.\r\n\r\n[2234] Taormina.\r\n\r\n[2235] Gosselin observes, that the distance from Messina to Cape\r\nPelorias, which would complete the circuit of Sicily, is about 9 miles.\r\n\r\n[2236] i. e. by land.\r\n\r\n[2237] Messina.\r\n\r\n[2238] An intelligent critic has imagined that this road may have been\r\ncommenced by M. Valerius Maximus Messala, consul in the year 263, and\r\ncensor in 253, before the Christian era. D’Orvill. Sic. c. ii. p. 12.\r\n\r\n[2239] We have followed Kramer, who inserts [διακόσια] before τριάκοντα\r\nπέντε.\r\n\r\n[2240] i. e. to give its parallels of latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\n[2241] i. e. wherein all three sides are unequal.\r\n\r\n[2242] i. e. Pelorias.\r\n\r\n[2243] Or, lies towards the east, with a northern inclination.\r\n\r\n[2244] South-east.\r\n\r\n[2245] A river of the Peloponnesus, now called Ruféa.\r\n\r\n[2246] Cape Matapan.\r\n\r\n[2247] The French translation gives 1160 stadia.\r\n\r\n[2248] Gossellin observes, that from Pachynus to Lilybæum the coast runs\r\nfrom the south to the north-west, and looks towards the south-west.\r\n\r\n[2249] This person, according to Varro, was named Strabo. See Varr. ap.\r\nPlin. Hist. Nat. lib. vii. § 21, page 386.\r\n\r\n[2250] This coast of Sicily rises very little as it advances towards the\r\neast, and looks almost continually towards the north, with the exception\r\nof a very short space near Lilybæum. The Æolian islands lie to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n[2251] Taormina.\r\n\r\n[2252] Naxos was not situated between Catana and Syracuse, but was most\r\nprobably built on the left bank of the Fiume Freddo, the ancient Asines,\r\nnear Taormina. It is possible that Strabo originally wrote, between\r\nMessina and Syracuse. Naxos was founded about 734 B. C., and destroyed\r\nby Dionysius the elder about the year 403. Naxos is thought by some to\r\nbe the modern Schisso.\r\n\r\n[2253] Megara was founded on the right of the Cantaro, the ancient\r\nAlabus. It was destroyed about 214 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2254] Reggio.\r\n\r\n[2255] Thucydides says ζάγκλιον is a Sicilian word.\r\n\r\n[2256] B. C. 289.\r\n\r\n[2257] B. C. 264 to 243.\r\n\r\n[2258] B. C. 44.\r\n\r\n[2259] B. C. 36.\r\n\r\n[2260] Now called Garafalo.\r\n\r\n[2261] Taormina.\r\n\r\n[2262] κοπρία.\r\n\r\n[2263] These wines, although grown in Sicily, were reckoned among the\r\nItalian wines. See Athen. Deipnos. lib. i. cap. 21, ed. Schweigh: tom.\r\ni. p. 102. And from the time of Julius Cæsar they were classed in the\r\nfourth division of the most esteemed wines. See Plin. Hist. Nat. lib.\r\nxiv. § 8, No. 4 and § 17.\r\n\r\n[2264] At the same time as Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[2265] A note in the French translation suggests that we should read\r\nSicilians of Hybla. τῶν ἐν Ὕβλῃ Σικελῶν instead of Ζαγκλαίων.\r\n\r\n[2266] Hiero in Greek was Ἱέρων. The line of Pindar in Kramer’s edition\r\nis,\r\n\r\n   ξύνες [ὅ] τοι λέγω, ζαθέων ἱερῶν ὁμώνυμε πάτερ,\r\n   κτίστορ Αἴτνας.\r\n\r\nThe words played on are Ἱέρων and ἱερῶν.\r\n\r\n[2267] This occurred in the year 468.\r\n\r\n[2268] About 461.\r\n\r\n[2269] Cluvier considers that the monastery of Saint Nicolas de Arenis,\r\nabout 12 modern miles from Catana, is situated about the place to which\r\nStrabo here alludes.\r\n\r\n[2270] τὴν Καταναίαν. The spelling of this name, like very many in the\r\npresent work, was by no means uniform in classic authors. Strabo has\r\ngenerally called it Catana (Κατάνη); Ptolemy, Κατάνη κολώνια; Pliny,\r\nlib. iii. cap. 8, Colonia Catina; Pomponius Mela, lib. ii. cap. 7,\r\nCatina; Cicero, Catina; and on ancient coins we find ΚΑΤΑΝΑΙΩΝ.\r\n\r\n[2271] This feat was recorded by divers works of art set up in different\r\nplaces: it must have taken place in one of the eruptions, 477, 453, or\r\n427, before the Christian era. The place where they lived was called\r\nCampus Piorum.\r\n\r\n[2272] δι’ ἡμερῶν τεσσάρων ἢ πέντε in Kramer’s text; in his notes he\r\nparticularizes the readings of the different manuscripts and editions,\r\nsome reading forty or fifty. He also records his sorrow at having\r\npreferred the reading of fifty days to thirty, in the passage relating\r\nto the fat beasts of Erythia, book iii. cap. 5, § 4, (page 255).\r\n\r\n[2273] Literally, changes into coagulation.\r\n\r\n[2274] About 758 or 735 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2275] Book vi. chap. 1, § 12.\r\n\r\n[2276] According to other authorities he was descended from Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2277] At present Corfu.\r\n\r\n[2278] Cape Bruzzano.\r\n\r\n[2279] Cicero’s Oratio Frumentaria supports this character of the\r\ncountry. Silius Italicus, lib. xiv. vers. 23, thus celebrates the\r\nrichness of the soil,\r\n\r\n   “Multa solo virtus: jam reddere fœnus aratris,\r\n   Jam montes umbrare olea, dare nomina Baccho;\r\n   Nectare Cecropias Hyblæo accendere ceras;”\r\n\r\nand Florus terms it Terra frugum ferax.\r\n\r\n[2280] Strabo makes a distinct mention of Siculi and Sicani, as if they\r\nwere different people. Philologists have been much divided as to whether\r\nthey were not different appellations of the same nation.\r\n\r\n[2281] Such as the Elymi, or Helymi, who occupied the districts\r\nbordering on the Belici in the western part of the island.\r\n\r\n[2282] It is probable that Morgantium was situated on the right bank of\r\nthe Giaretta, below its confluence with the Dattaino, but at some little\r\ndistance from the sea; at least such is the opinion of Cluverius, in\r\nopposition to the views of Sicilian topographers. Sic. Ant. book ii.\r\ncap. 7, pp. 325 and 335.\r\n\r\n[2283] The first settlement of the Carthaginians in Sicily was about 560\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n[2284] 212 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2285] 42 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2286] They were called Nesos, [the island Ortygia,] Achradina, Tycha,\r\nNeapolis, and Epipolæ. Ausonius applies the epithet fourfold,\r\n\r\n   “Quis Catinam sileat? quis quadruplices Syracusas?”\r\n\r\nDionysius however fortified Epipolæ with a wall, and joined it to the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[2287] Twenty-two miles four perches English. Swinburne spent two days\r\nin examining the extent of the ruins, and was satisfied as to the\r\naccuracy of Strabo’s statement.\r\n\r\n[2288] A river of Elis.\r\n\r\n[2289] Virgil thus deals with the subject:\r\n\r\n   “Sicanio prætenta sinu jacet insula contra\r\n   Plemmyrium undosum: nomen dixere priores\r\n   Ortygiam. Alpheum fama est huc, Elidis amnem,\r\n   Occultas egisse vias subter mare; qui nunc\r\n   Ore, Arethusa, tuo Siculis confunditur undis.”\r\n\r\n   Æn. iii. 692.\r\n\r\n[2290] The words of Pindar are,\r\n\r\n   ἄμπνευμα σεμνὸν Ἀλφεοῦ,\r\n   κλεινᾶν Συρακοσσᾶν θάλος, Ὀρτυγία.\r\n\r\nThe French translators have rendered them,\r\n\r\n   “Terme saint du tourment d’Alphée\r\n   Bel ornement, de Syracuse _Ortygia_!”\r\n\r\nAnd Groskurd,\r\n\r\n   “Ehrwürdige Ruhstatt Alpheos’.\r\n   Ruhmzweig Syrakossai’s, o Du Ortygia.”\r\n\r\nLiddell and Scott call ἀνάπνευμα a resting-place, referring to this\r\npassage, but I can see no reason for not allowing to it the\r\nsignification most suitable to the passage. ἀναπνέω is, “to breathe\r\nagain,” and, according to the supposition of the ancients, the Alpheus\r\nmight justly be said to breathe again on appearing at Arethusa, after\r\nits passage beneath the bed of the sea from Greece. ἀναπνοὴ also, means\r\n“a recovering of breath.”\r\n\r\n[2291] Pindar, Nem. Od. i. vers. 1. See also Bohn's Classic. Lib.\r\nPindar.\r\n\r\n[2292] Conf. Antig. Caryst. Hist. Mir. cap. 155.\r\n\r\n[2293] According to Strabo himself, book viii. chap. 3, § 12, the\r\nAlpheus flows through a subterraneous course before it comes to Olympia;\r\nthe objection therefore which he here takes, rests only on the\r\ncircumstance of the river pursuing a visible course all the way to the\r\nsea, from the point where the chalice had fallen into it.\r\n\r\n[2294] A river of Elis.\r\n\r\n[2295] The play from which this is quoted is not extant.\r\n\r\n[2296] A people of Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[2297] A people of Argos.\r\n\r\n[2298] Aspro-potamo.\r\n\r\n[2299] In the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n[2300] The Lao or the Pollina.\r\n\r\n[2301] Pollina.\r\n\r\n[2302] The Porto Maggiore of Syracuse is scarcely half so large.\r\n\r\n[2303] Centorbe, to the south-west of Ætna. Silius, lib. xiv., mentions\r\nit as “Centuripe, largoque virens Entella Lyæo.”\r\n\r\n[2304] The ancient Symæthus.\r\n\r\n[2305] Now Camarana: it was founded 600 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2306] Girgenti.\r\n\r\n[2307] “Apparet Camarina procul, campique Geloi.” Virg. Æn. iii. 701.\r\n\r\n[2308] Marsalla.\r\n\r\n[2309] I Bagni.\r\n\r\n[2310] S. Maria di Tindaro.\r\n\r\n[2311] Castel-à-Mare.\r\n\r\n[2312] Cefalù.\r\n\r\n[2313] Now ruins at Barbara.\r\n\r\n[2314] Also called Acestes.\r\n\r\n[2315] Castro-Ioanni.\r\n\r\n[2316] Ovid, in the fourth book of his Fasti, thus alludes to the\r\ntemple,\r\n\r\n   “Grata domus Cereri, multas ea possidet urbes,\r\n     In quibus est culto fertilis Enna solo.”\r\n\r\nFrom this place we have the adjective Enneus, and the Ennea virgo of\r\nSil., lib. xiv., for Proserpine,\r\n\r\n   “Tum rapta præceps Ennea virgine flexit.”\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus, lib. v. cap. 3, says that there was a fable about the\r\nseizure of the virgin [Proserpine] in the meadows near Enna. The\r\nlocality is very near the town, embellished with violets and all kinds\r\nof beautiful flowers. An ancient coin of the place described by Ezech.\r\nSpanheim, page 906, is inscribed with the letters MUN. HENNAE.\r\nPliny, lib. iii. cap. 8, writes, “Municipes Hennenses.”\r\n\r\n[2317] About 146 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2318] The sentence from “Eryx” to “notice,” placed between daggers,\r\nseems to have been transposed from the end of § 5; it should immediately\r\nsucceed the words Ægestus the Trojan.\r\n\r\n[2319] Diodorus Siculus, lib. iv. § 83, tom. i. p. 326, gives a\r\ndifferent account of the state of this place at this time.\r\n\r\n[2320] The Carthaginians had destroyed it about 409 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2321] Some colonists from Rhodes made a settlement here 45 years after\r\nthe foundation of Syracuse. It was overthrown about 279 years B. C.\r\n\r\n[2322] Milazzo.\r\n\r\n[2323] About 649 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2324] It is supposed that Callipolis anciently occupied the site of\r\nMascalis.\r\n\r\n[2325] Those who inhabited Hybla Minor.

C., and founded Leontini,\r\nnow Lentini.\r\n\r\n[2328] Eubœa was destroyed by the tyrant Gelon, who reigned from 491 to\r\n478 B. C. Eubali, Castellazzio, and a place near the little town of\r\nLicodia, not far from the source of the Drillo, have been supposed to be\r\nthe site of the ancient Eubœa. Siebenkees thinks that the words between\r\ndaggers at the end of § 7 should follow “Eubœa.”\r\n\r\n[2329] Lit. barbarians.\r\n\r\n[2330] About 134 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2331] Castro-Ioanni.\r\n\r\n[2332] Kramer and Siebenkees consider that the sentence between daggers,\r\nfrom “The” to “prosperity,” has been transferred from its proper place.\r\nSee note [2328], page 412.\r\n\r\n[2333] The French translators infer from this passage that Strabo had\r\nnever visited Sicily.\r\n\r\n[2334] Sicilian topographers vary exceedingly in defining the position\r\nof these mountains. Groskurd makes them Madonia.\r\n\r\n[2335] To the south-west.\r\n\r\n[2336] See Humboldt, Cosmos, i. 242.\r\n\r\n[2337] Book v. chap. iv. § 9.\r\n\r\n[2338] I Bagni di Sciacca.\r\n\r\n[2339] Now ruins at Barbara, in the valley of Mazzara.\r\n\r\n[2340] Girgenti.\r\n\r\n[2341] A modern traveller is of opinion that these correspond with\r\ncertain peculiar marshes near Girgenti, in the midst of the Macaluba\r\nmountains, supplied by a spring of salt water. The soil here is chalky,\r\nand the mountains abound in a grey and ductile clay. See Monsieur le\r\nCommandeur de Dolomieu, Voyage aux îles de Lipari, pp. 165 _et seqq._;\r\nalso Fazell. Decad. i. lib. i. cap. 5, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[2342] The place dedicated to these avengers of perjury is frequently\r\nlocated near Mineo and Palagonia; others, thinking to gain the support\r\nof Virgil’s testimony, place it near Paterno, much farther north,\r\nbetween Catana and Centorbi, and not far from the banks of the Giaretta,\r\nthe ancient Symæthus.\r\n\r\n[2343] Cluvier supposes this cavern must have been near Mazarum\r\n[Mazara]. The river named Mazarus by the ancients, runs through a rocky\r\ndistrict, abounding in stone quarries. It is possible that this river,\r\nmuch hemmed in throughout its course, might have anciently flowed\r\nbeneath some of these massive rocks.\r\n\r\n[2344] Orontes.\r\n\r\n[2345] According to Pliny, Hist. Nat. lib. vi. § 31, tom. i. p. 333, the\r\nTigris is ingulfed on reaching a branch of Mount Taurus, at a place\r\ncalled Zoroanda, which M. D’Anville identifies with the modern Hazour.\r\n\r\n[2346] Λιβύη in Strabo.\r\n\r\n[2347] Kramer here persists in reading πρὸ, and rejects ἀπὸ: we have\r\nendeavoured to translate it with Kramer, but the French translation of\r\n1809 renders it, a little below its sources.\r\n\r\n[2348] A river of Argolis: see book viii. Casaub. pp. 371 and 389.\r\n\r\n[2349] Argolis.\r\n\r\n[2350] This ancient city was found in ruins by Pausanias, who says\r\n(Arcadic. or book viii. cap. 44, p. 691) “that at less than 20 stadia\r\ndistant from the Athenæum are found the ruins of Asea, as well as the\r\nhill on which the citadel of the town was built, which was surrounded by\r\nwalls, the vestiges of which still remain. About 5 stadia from Asea, and\r\nnot far from the main road, is the source of the Alpheus, and, quite\r\nclose, even at the edge of the road, that of the Eurotas.... [At a short\r\ndistance] the two rivers unite and run as one for about 20 stadia; they\r\nthen both cast themselves into a chasm, and, continuing their\r\nunder-ground course, they afterwards reappear; one (the Eurotas) in\r\nLaconia, the other in the territory of Megalopolis.” Such is what\r\nPausanias relates in one place. But when, in this account, he fixes the\r\nsource of the Alpheus at about 5 stadia from Asea, we must understand\r\nhim to allude to a second source of the river; for further on (book\r\nviii. cap. 54, p. 709) he says distinctly that the main source of the\r\nAlpheus is seen near Phylace in Arcadia; then adds that that river, on\r\ncoming to the district of Tegea, is absorbed under the ground, to\r\nre-issue near Asea.\r\n\r\n[2351] See § 4 of this chapter, page 408.\r\n\r\n[2352] The ancient Timavus. See book v. chap. i. § 8, page 319.\r\n\r\n[2353] The French translation, “en divers endroits de l’Italie.” Some\r\nmanuscripts read Ἰταλίαν. We have followed Kramer and Groskurd.\r\n\r\n[2354] Founded about B. C. 580.\r\n\r\n[2355] Thermessa, at present called Vulcano, is doubtless the same\r\nmentioned in Pliny’s Nat. Hist. lib. iii. § 14, tom. i. p. 164, as\r\nTherasia, by the error of the copyist. Paulus Orosius, lib. iv. cap. 20,\r\nsays that it rose from the bed of the sea, B. C. 571. It is however\r\ncertain that it was in existence B. C. 427, confer. Thucyd. lib. iii. §\r\n88, and was for a considerable time called Hiera.\r\n\r\n[2356] See Pausan. Phoc. or lib. x. cap. 16, p. 835.\r\n\r\n[2357] See Pausan. Phoc. or lib. x. cap. 2, p. 824.\r\n\r\n[2358] M. le Comm. de Dolomieu, in his Voyage aux îles de Lipari, ed.\r\n1783, p. 75 _et seqq._, supports the character here given of the\r\nfertility of this island, and praises the abundance of delicious fruits\r\nit produces.\r\n\r\n[2359] M. le Comm. de Dolomieu considers it probable that the Liparæans\r\nobtained this alum by the lixiviation of earths exposed to the\r\nacido-sulphurous vapours of their volcanos, pp. 77, 78.\r\n\r\n[2360] These hot springs are not much frequented, although they still\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[2361] See Humboldt, Cosm. i. 242.\r\n\r\n[2362] This is 30 feet in the epitome.\r\n\r\n[2363] Odyss. lib. x. 21.\r\n\r\n[2364] Here follow some words which convey no intelligible meaning.—They\r\nare written in the margin of some of the manuscripts. Kramer inserts\r\nthem between asterisks as follows: *ἔστιν ἡ ἐπίστασις τῆς ἐναργείας\r\nλέγοιτ’ ἄν,... ἐπίσης τε γὰρ ἄμφω πάρεστι, καὶ διαθέσει καὶ τῇ\r\nἐναργείᾳ· ἥ γε ἡδονὴ κοινὸν ἀμφοτέρων* Groskurd thinks the passage\r\nmight be translated, “[Great, undoubtedly,] is the impression produced\r\nby animated energy, [of which] it may be asserted [that it excites in a\r\nmarked degree both admiration and pleasure]. For both arise equally from\r\ngraphic representation and animated description. Pleasure at least is\r\ncommon to both.” The following are Groskurd’s own words: Gross\r\nallerdings ist der Eindruck kräftiger Lebendigkeit, [von welcher] man\r\nbehaupten darf, [dass sie vorzüglich, sowohl Bewunderung als Vergnügen\r\ngewähre]. Denn Beide erfolgen gleichermassen, sowohl durch Darstellung\r\nals durch Lebendigkeit; das Vergnügen wenigstens ist Beiden gemein.\r\n\r\n[2365] Stromboli.\r\n\r\n[2366] στρογγύλος means “round.” M. Dolomieu, p. 113, says that the\r\nisland of Stromboli, seen from a distance, appears like a cone; when,\r\nhowever, it is more particularly examined, it looks like a mountain\r\nterminated by two peaks of different heights, and the sides appear\r\ndisturbed and torn by craters opened in various parts, and streams of\r\nlava which have flowed down. It might be about 12 miles in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n[2367] Most of the ancient authors agree in considering Lipari as the\r\nresidence of Æolus. See Cluver. Sic. Ant. lib. ii. cap. 14.\r\n\r\n[2368] δίδυμος, “double.” Cluverius identifies this with the island now\r\ncalled Salini. M. Dolomieu says that Didyma is situated to the west of\r\nLipari; it is nearly circular, and contains three mountains placed so as\r\nto form a triangle. Two of the mountains are connected at their bases,\r\nthe third is separated from them by a valley which runs right across the\r\nisland, so that while sailing at some distance in the sea on the south\r\nside it has the appearance of two islands, from which circumstance it\r\ntook its ancient name of Didyma: its present name, Salini, is derived\r\nfrom salt works there.\r\n\r\n[2369] Ericussa, now called Alicudi or Alicurim, is covered with trees,\r\nit is inhabited, but little cultivated. The pasturage is pretty good.\r\n\r\n[2370] Phœnicussa, now Felicudi or Filicurim, abounds in rich pastures;\r\nboth wheat and the vine are here cultivated.\r\n\r\n[2371] Cluverius, Sic. Ant. lib. ii. p. 414, identifies this island with\r\nLisca-Bianca, to the east of Lipari, but M. le commandeur Dolomieu,\r\nVoyage pittoresque de Naples et de Sicile, tom. iv. part ii. chap. 14,\r\nconsiders that it corresponded with the present Panaria, which is about\r\neight times the circumference of Lisca-Bianca. He says the neighbouring\r\nislets are but the detached portions of a vast crater now submerged; the\r\ndenomination, Formocoli or the Little Ants, is aptly illustrative of\r\ntheir minuteness and numbers. The most important are Datolo, Lisca-Nera,\r\nLisca-Bianca, and Basiluzzo. M. Gossellin very justly remarks that it is\r\nquite possible the volcanos, which continually burn in the islands of\r\nÆolus, may have formed some new one, and gives some good reasons for\r\nidentifying Didyma with Panaria.\r\n\r\n[2372] Rich. Pocock, Descr. de l’ Or., &c. vers. Fr. part iii. chap. 24,\r\ntom. vi. p. 327, considers that Strabo meant to say that Euonymus lies\r\nmost to the left hand as you sail from Sicily to the island of Lipari,\r\nand proposes Ustica, the westernmost of the Lipari Islands, as its\r\nmodern representative.\r\n\r\n[2373] See Humboldt, Cosmos ii. 557.\r\n\r\n[2374] A note in the French translation suggests that, notwithstanding\r\nthe accord of all manuscripts, we should, doubtless, understand Titus\r\nQuinctius Flaminius, prætor in A. U. C. 628, and B. C. 126.\r\n\r\n[2375] πρὸς ἄρκτον, in Kramer’s text. We have followed the example set\r\nby the French translators, and approved by Groskurd, who proposes to\r\nread πρὸς ἀρκτ[ικὸν ἄκρ]ον. Kramer however justly remarks, that many\r\nother things in this passage are exceedingly confused, and remain\r\nincapable of conjectural elucidation.\r\n\r\n[2376] From Ericodes, now Alicudi, to Phœnicodes, now Felicudi, the\r\ndistance given by the chorographer is the same as that set down by\r\nPtolemy, and by far too much for that which, according to our charts,\r\nseparates Felicudi from Salini, but tallies exactly with that to the\r\nisland Panaria, so that the evidence, both of the chorographer and\r\nPtolemy, seems to point to Panaria, not to Salini, as the ancient\r\nDidyma. Further, the 29 miles given in Strabo’s text as the distance\r\nfrom Didyma to Lipari, are reduced to 19 miles in the chart of Ptolemy,\r\nand even this last distance would be much too great for the interval\r\nwhich separates Salini from Lipari, but agrees with the distance from\r\nLipari to Panaria, and seems likewise to confirm the identity of Panaria\r\nand Didyma. The 19 miles, from Lipari to Sicily, agree with Ptolemy and\r\nour charts. Ptolemy gives the equivalent of 44 miles as the distance\r\nbetween Sicily and Strongyle, while our modern maps confirm his\r\ncomputation. M. Gossellin observes that the 16 miles of the existing\r\ntext of Strabo must be a transcriber’s error; but the construction of\r\nthe text might very well allow the distance to be from Didyma to\r\nStrongyle, which would be nearly correct.\r\n\r\n[2377] Malta.\r\n\r\n[2378] Towards Africa and the south.\r\n\r\n[2379] Μελιταῖα.\r\n\r\n[2380] All other classic authors, both Greek and Latin, give the name of\r\nGaulus to this island; it is the modern Gozzo.\r\n\r\n[2381] Pantelaria.\r\n\r\n[2382] This M. Gossellin very satisfactorily proves to be 88.\r\n\r\n[2383] A note in the French translation observes, that the Iapygia of\r\nStrabo was confined to the peninsula of Tarentum.\r\n\r\n[2384] The Sallentini, or Salentini, cannot be distinguished with\r\naccuracy from the Calabri, as the name is used by several writers in a\r\nvery extensive sense, and applied to the greater part of Iapygia.\r\n\r\n[2385] Capo di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[2386] The district occupied by the Calabri seems to have been that\r\nmaritime part of the Iapygian peninsula extending from the ancient\r\nBrundusium to the city of Hydruntum, answering nearly to what is now\r\ncalled Terra di Lecce.\r\n\r\n[2387] Dionysius of Halicarnassius derives the name of this people from\r\nPeucetius, son of Lycaon king of Arcadia, but they are generally spoken\r\nof in history as barbarians, differing in no essential respect from the\r\nDaunii, Iapyges, and other neighbouring nations.\r\n\r\n[2388] A note in the French translation remarks, that Strabo would have\r\ndone well to add, “_and also the Apuli properly so called_.” If we\r\nfollow Strabo’s testimony solely, we may almost describe the bounds of\r\nthe Peucetii by four lines, viz. 1. From Tarentum to Brindisi. 2. Along\r\nthe sea-shore from Brindisi to Bari. 3. From Bari to Garagnone or\r\nGorgoglione, the ancient Sylvium, if not even still nearer to Venosa. 4.\r\nFrom Garagnone to Tarentum, constituting what is called in modern\r\ngeography Terra di Bari—The following are the limits of the Daunii. 1.\r\nFrom Garagnone to Bari. 2. From Bari to Peschici or to Rodi. 3. Thence\r\nto Lucera; and, 4. from Lucera to Garagnone. Thus they occupied a great\r\npart of La Puglia, with a portion of the Terra di Bari. With regard to\r\nthose who, according to Strabo, were properly Apuli, they extended from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Lucera to Rodi or Peschici, thence to the mouth of\r\nthe river Fortore, thence to Civitate, (the ancient Teanum Apulum,)\r\nwhich was included, and from Civitate to Lucera; this district would\r\nanswer to the northern portion of La Puglia, which the Fortore separates\r\nfrom La Capitanata.\r\n\r\n[2389] The name of Pœdiculi was given to the inhabitants of that portion\r\nof Peucetia which was more particularly situated on the coast between\r\nthe Aufidus and the confines of the Calabri. Pliny (iii. 11) states that\r\nthis particular tribe derived their origin from Illyria.\r\n\r\n[2390] Brindisi.\r\n\r\n[2391] Capo di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[2392] We have followed Groskurd’s example in introducing this thousand.\r\nThe French translators thought it too hardy to venture, and Kramer was\r\nfearful to insert it in his text, but he approves of it in his notes.\r\n\r\n[2393] Manuscripts here have blanks.\r\n\r\n[2394] Ruins near Torre a Mare.\r\n\r\n[2395] Mare-piccolo.\r\n\r\n[2396] Or twelve miles and a half. This computation does not agree with\r\nmodern measurements, which reckon the circuit at sixteen miles. See\r\nSwinburne’s Travels, tom. i. sect. 32. Gagliardi, Topogr. di Taranto.\r\n\r\n[2397] In the year 213 or 212 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2398] B.

C.\r\n\r\n[2401] I have here translated τοῖς τοῦ δήμου and οἱ τοῦ δήμου by “free\r\ncitizens”. Several notes have been written on the exact meaning of the\r\nwords, but I am not satisfied that we understand it properly. It might\r\nperhaps mean those appointed to the chief rule of the state by the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n[2402] There is little doubt that this passage is corrupt.\r\n\r\n[2403] κυνέη, a leathern cap or hat, a helmet, &c. See also page 426.\r\n\r\n[2404] About eight miles to the east or south-east of Taranto, upon the\r\ncoast, we find a place named Saturo. In this place the country open to\r\nthe south presents the most agreeable aspect. Sheltered from the north\r\nwind, and watered by numerous running streams, it produces the choicest\r\nfruits, oranges, citrons, lemons, pomegranates, figs, and all manner of\r\ngarden produce, with which Taranto is abundantly supplied.

Ant. lib. ii. cap. 15, p.\r\n207, is of opinion that Camici occupied the site of Siculiana, on the\r\nFiume delle Canne. D’Anville, Géogr. Anc. tom. i. p. 219, and tom. iii.\r\np. 146, seems to locate Camici at Platanella, on the Fiume di Platani.\r\n\r\n[2407] There are various readings of this name.\r\n\r\n[2408] There is a tradition that Taras was born to Neptune by Satyræa,\r\ndaughter of Minos.\r\n\r\n[2409] About 745 B.

C.\r\n\r\n[2419] Cramer, in his Ancient Italy, has very justly remarked that the\r\nname of the small river Calandro, which discharges itself into the sea a\r\nlittle below Capo di Roseto, bears some affinity to the river Acalandrus\r\nmentioned by Strabo. However, some have thought it identical with the\r\nSalandrella and the Fiume di Roseto, while Cluverius was of opinion that\r\nwe should here read Κυλίσταρνος instead of Ἀκάλανδρος, and identify it\r\nwith the modern Racanello.\r\n\r\n[2420] 326 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2421] 209 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2422] 124 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2423] Some suspect this last sentence to be an interpolation; certain\r\nit is that there is great difficulty in finding a time to correspond\r\nwith all the circumstances contained in it. According to M. Heyne, this\r\nwar must have taken place 474 B. C., but then Heraclea was not founded\r\ntill 436 B. C. It seems too that the people of Iapygia had kings as late\r\nas 480 B.

The fleets of\r\nAthens, after passing the Peloponnesus, are represented on this passage\r\nas usually making for Corcyra, from whence they steered straight across\r\nto the promontory, and then coasted along the south of Italy for the\r\nremainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\n[2427] The south-east.\r\n\r\n[2428] The Acra Iapygia.\r\n\r\n[2429] See notes to page 393 of this translation.\r\n\r\n[2430] Cramer remarks that Veretum is still represented by the old\r\nchurch of S.

This place\r\nwas called Hydruntum by Pliny and other authors.\r\n\r\n[2434] Now Saseno, distant 35 minutes from Otranto.\r\n\r\n[2435] B.

Cramer, in his description of Ancient Italy,\r\nvol. ii. p. 316, says, Aletium is naturally supposed to have occupied\r\nthe site of the church of S. Maria della Lizza.—It was called Ἀλήτιον by\r\nPtolemy.\r\n\r\n[2437] We have followed Kramer’s reading; some MSS. have Θυρέαι, some\r\nΘυραῖαι, &c.\r\n\r\n[2438] lit. of a certain one of the nobles.\r\n\r\n[2439] Οὐρία, MSS., but a note in the French translation explains that\r\nStrabo was quoting Herodotus from memory.

Maria di Capua.\r\n\r\n[2457] Eustathius explains that those mountains were called Ceraunian\r\nfrom the frequent falling of thunderbolts upon them. Τὰ Κεραύνια ὄρη,\r\nοὕτω καλούμενα διὰ τὸ συχνοὺς ἐκεῖ πίπτειν κεραυνούς.\r\n\r\n[2458] Durazzo.\r\n\r\n[2459] It seems as if some words had been skipped in this place, for we\r\nshould expect to have the distance of the other passage to the Ceraunian\r\nMountains, but Strabo no where mentions it.\r\n\r\n[2460] M. Gossellin seems to think we should here read 800 and not 1800\r\nstadia; but Kramer reckons it improbable. Groskurd concurs essentially\r\nwith the opinion of M. Gossellin, and translates it something as\r\nfollows: “for it is 1000, while the former is 800 stadia across.”\r\n\r\n[2461] Now Torre d’ Agnazzo.\r\n\r\n[2462] Bari.\r\n\r\n[2463] Silvium was situated on the Appian Way. Holstenius and Pratilli\r\nagree in fixing its position at Garagnone, about 15 miles to the\r\nsouth-west of Venosa. Holsten. Adnot. p. 281. Pratilli, Via Appia, l.\r\niv. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2464] About 310 stadia.\r\n\r\n[2465] The Aufidus, celebrated by Horace, Od. iv. 9,\r\n\r\n   “Ne forte credas interitura, quæ\r\n   Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum,\r\n     Non ante vulgatas per artes\r\n       Verba loquor socianda chordis.”\r\n\r\n[2466] M. Gossellin considers this rather too much, and supposes 315\r\nstadia would be nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[2467] Ruins now called Salpi.\r\n\r\n[2468] Now Lucera.\r\n\r\n[2469] See book v. c. 1, § 9, p. 320. Ptolemy makes these five, which is\r\nthe number of the isles of Tremiti at present, if we include in the\r\ngroup three barren rocks, which scarce deserve the name of islands. One\r\nwas called Diomedea by Pliny, and Tremitus by Tacitus, who states that\r\nAugustus appointed it as the prison of his grand-daughter Julia; the\r\nsecond was called Teutria. The largest is at present called Isola San\r\nDomino, the other Isola San Nicolo.\r\n\r\n[2470] Book v. c. i. § 9, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[2471] Siponto, a place in ruins near Manfredonia.\r\n\r\n[2472] Sestini describes a gold coin belonging to this city, on which\r\nthe emblem of a cuttle fish in Greek, σηπία, is apparent. The legend is\r\nΣιπο. Sestini descrizione d’ una Med. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[2473] Lycophron calls this stream by the name of Althænus.\r\n\r\n[2474] Groskurd is of opinion that some words to the following effect\r\nhave been accidentally lost from this place, viz. “The coast of Daunia\r\nforms an extensive bay about these parts.”\r\n\r\n[2475] Now Punta di Viesti. Strabo seems to have considered the whole of\r\nthe extensive neck of land lying between the bay of Rodi and that of\r\nManfredonia, as the Garganum Promontorium. Lucan, v. 380, thus describes\r\nits prominence,\r\n\r\n   Apulus Hadriacas exit Garganus in undas.\r\n\r\n[2476] About 37 miles towards the east.\r\n\r\n[2477] Rodi.\r\n\r\n[2478] See book v. c. i. § 9, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[2479] Brindisi.\r\n\r\n[2480] M. Gossellin gives a long note to show that the chorographer and\r\nArtemidorus were both correct in the distances they gave, but asserts\r\nthat Strabo was mistaken as to the length of the stadium used by\r\nArtemidorus, and consequently thought he saw a discrepancy between their\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n[2481] The ancient Æsis.\r\n\r\n[2482] We think, with Kramer, that Sena Gallica, now Sinigaglia, was the\r\ncity Strabo intends.\r\n\r\n[2483] From the Capo della Linguetta, on the coast of Albania.\r\n\r\n[2484] The town of Aquileia.\r\n\r\n[2485] M. Gossellin suggests that Strabo omitted the coast of Istria in\r\nhis calculations, when he made this observation on the length of the\r\nIllyrian shore, and refers to what Strabo will himself state in book\r\nvii. chap. v. sections 3, 4, and 9, and to his estimate of 6150 stadia\r\nfrom the Ceraunian Mountains to Iapygia in book ii. chap. iv. § 3, p.\r\n159.\r\n\r\n[2486] Doubtless the bight between the shore, adjacent to Peschici, to\r\nthe north of Viesti, and the Punta d’ Asinella.\r\n\r\n[2487] A note in the French translation observes that the Apuli,\r\nproperly so called, could but have occupied the shore of half this bay,\r\nfor the Fortore falls into it just about the centre, which river was a\r\ncommon boundary between the Apuli and Frentani.\r\n\r\n[2488] B. C. 216.\r\n\r\n[2489] Cramer says, the lake which Strabo speaks of as being near\r\nTeanum, but without mentioning its name, is called by Pliny Lacus\r\nPontanus, (iii. 11,) now Lago di Lesina.\r\n\r\n[2490] The city of Teanum stood on the right bank of the Fortore, the\r\nancient Frento; its ruins are stated to exist on the site of Civitate,\r\nabout a mile from the right bank of the Fortore, and ten miles from the\r\nsea. Cramer, vol. ii. p. 273.\r\n\r\n[2491] Now Teano, six miles from Sessa, and fifteen from Capua.\r\n\r\n[2492] Pozzuolo.\r\n\r\n[2493] M. Gossellin observes that from the head of the bay of Naples to\r\nthe shores bordering the ancient Teanum, there are 80 minutes, or 933\r\nstadia of 700.\r\n\r\n[2494] Romanelli is of opinion that the ruins of Buca exist at the\r\npresent Penna.\r\n\r\n[2495] Book v. chap. iv. § 2, p. 359.\r\n\r\n[2496] In the year 747 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2497] In the year 594 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2498] The Latins were first subjected in 499 B. C., but not totally\r\nsubjugated; the Sabines were almost annihilated in the war which\r\nhappened about 450 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2499] See Polyb. Hist. book i. chap. vi. § 1, edit. Schweigh, tom. i.\r\np. 12.\r\n\r\n[2500] This battle was fought in the year 405 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2501] Concluded 387 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2502] About 338 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2503] About 310 B.

C. 19.\r\n\r\n[2519] About A. D. 17 or 18.\r\n\r\n[2520] From this expression we may gather that Strabo wrote this 6th\r\nBook of his Geography during the lifetime of Juba, and, as we shall\r\npresently see, about A. D. 18; while he did not compile the 17th Book\r\ntill after Juba’s death, which must have taken place before A. D. 21.\r\nSee M. l’Abbé Sevin, Rech. sur la Vie, &c., de Juba, _Ac. des Inscr. et\r\nBelles-Lettres_, vol. iv. _Mém._ p. 462.\r\n\r\n[2521] Attalus III., king of Pergamus, died 133 B. C., and constituted\r\nthe Roman people his heir.\r\n\r\n[2522] We may here observe that the Seleucidæ ceased to reign in Syria\r\nas early as 83 B. C., when that country, wearied of their sad\r\ndissensions, willingly submitted to Tigranes the king of Armenia, but\r\ntheir race was not extinct, and even in the year 64 B. C. when Pompey\r\nmade the kingdom a Roman province, there were two princes of the\r\nSeleucidæ, Antiochus Asiaticus and his brother Seleucus-Cybiosactes, who\r\nhad an hereditary right to the throne; the latter however died about 54\r\nB. C., and in him terminated the race of the Seleucidæ.\r\n\r\n[2523] The race of the kings of Paphlagonia became extinct about 7 B. C.\r\nSee M. l’Abbé Belley, Diss. sur l’ère de Germanicopolis, &c. _Ac. des\r\nInscr. et Belles-Lettres_, vol. xxx. _Mém._ p. 331.\r\n\r\n[2524] The royal race of Cappadocia failed about 91 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2525] The race of the Lagidæ terminated with Ptolemy Auletes, who died\r\n44 B. C., leaving two daughters, Cleopatra and Arsinoë. Ptolemy Apion\r\ndied 96 B. C.; he left Cyrene, whereof he was king, to the Roman people.\r\n\r\n[2526] Now the Fasz or Rion.\r\n\r\n[2527] The Forat, Ferat, or Frat.\r\n\r\n[2528] The ancient Ister.\r\n\r\n[2529] Strabo will relate in book vii. chap. iv. § 4, that after the\r\ndefeat of Mithridates Eupator they became subject to the Romans.\r\n\r\n[2530] See more as to these people in book vii. chap. iii. § 17.\r\n\r\n[2531] Inhabitants of tents.\r\n\r\n[2532] In the year 20 B. C. See book xvi. chap. i. § 28.\r\n\r\n[2533] Compare Tacitus, Annales, lib. ii. § 1.\r\n\r\n[2534] As Vonones, mentioned by Tacitus in his second book.\r\n\r\n[2535] Compare the words of Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. § 9, Non aliud\r\ndiscordantis patriæ remedium fuisse, quàm ut ab uno regeretur.\r\n\r\n[2536] Germanicus was appointed to take charge of the East in A. D. 17,\r\nin 18 he took possession of his government, and died in 19. Drusus was\r\nin command of the armies of Germany in A. D. 17. Thus we may safely\r\nconclude this 6th book of Strabo’s Geography to have been written in A.\r\nD. 18.\r\n\r\n[2537] The ancient Tanais.\r\n\r\n[2538] Palus Mæotis.\r\n\r\n[2539] The ancient Ister.\r\n\r\n[2540] The ancient Propontis.\r\n\r\n[2541] Strabo, in a subsequent passage, states that the distance from\r\nthe Danube to the city Trieste, at the head of the Adriatic, is about\r\n1200 stadia.\r\n\r\n[2542] The ancient Tyras.\r\n\r\n[2543] The Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2544] The Bastarnæ were a people occupying portions of the modern\r\nMoldavia, Podolia, and the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n[2545] The Tyregetæ, or the Getæ of the river Tyras, were a people\r\ndwelling on the Dniester, to the south of the Bastarnæ.\r\n\r\n[2546] The ancient geographers supposed that the Northern Ocean extended\r\nto the 56° of north latitude. Their notions of the existence of the\r\nBaltic were vague. They therefore confounded it with the Northern Ocean,\r\nthus making the continent of Europe to extend only to the 56° of north\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n[2547] See book iv. chap. iv. § 2, pp. 291, 292.\r\n\r\n[2548] Strabo’s words are, γνήσιοι γὰρ oἱ Γερμανοὶ κατὰ τὴν Ῥωμαίων\r\nδιάλεκτον. It is possible he may be endeavouring to explain that the γερ\r\nin Germani is equivalent to the Latin verus, “true,” the wahr of modern\r\nGerman, and that Germani signifies the true men of the country, the\r\nundoubted autochthones of Galatia or Gaul.\r\n\r\n[2549] The Marsi were a people dwelling on the banks of the Ems, near\r\nMunster.\r\n\r\n[2550] The Sicambri were located near the Menapii. See above, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[2551] The Albis.\r\n\r\n[2552] Amasias.\r\n\r\n[2553] The name of this tribe is written variously by different authors.\r\nThey are supposed to have occupied the lands between the Rhine, the Ems,\r\nand the Lippe, but their boundaries were very uncertain, on account of\r\ntheir continual wars.\r\n\r\n[2554] This refers to the chain of mountains which, running from the\r\nnorth of Switzerland, traverses Wurtemberg, Franconia, Bohemia, Moravia,\r\nand joins Mount Krapak.\r\n\r\n[2555] The Hercynian Wood, or Black Forest, was either one or a\r\nsuccession of continuous forests, extending from the banks of the Rhine\r\nto the confines of Persia and Bactriana.\r\n\r\n[2556] The Suevi occupied a considerable portion of Germany, to the\r\nnorth and east of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[2557] Coldui manuscripts. Kramer agrees with Cluverius in this\r\ninstance, and we have followed Kramer’s text.\r\n\r\n[2558] The Lugii of Tacitus.\r\n\r\n[2559] Zeus thinks these were the Burri of Dio Cassius, lxviii. 8. See\r\nZeus, Die Deutschen, &c., p. 126.\r\n\r\n[2560] Kramer has Γούτωνας, although the MSS. have Βούτωνας. He is led\r\nto this emendation by Cluverius and others. Cluv. Germ. Antiq. lib. iii.\r\nc. 34, page 625.\r\n\r\n[2561] The Gambrivii of Tacitus, Germ. cap. 2.\r\n\r\n[2562] Cluverius considers these were the Chamavi.\r\n\r\n[2563] We have followed Kramer’s text. MSS. read Bucteri.\r\n\r\n[2564] For Caulci, Campsiani, Cluverius would read Cathulci, Campsani. A\r\nlittle further on Strabo calls the Campsiani Ampsani.\r\n\r\n[2565] Amasias.\r\n\r\n[2566] Visurgis.\r\n\r\n[2567] Lupias.\r\n\r\n[2568] Salas.\r\n\r\n[2569] Borcum. Pliny calls this island Burchana, and adds, that the\r\nRomans gave it the name of Fabaria, on account of the beans (in Latin\r\nFaba) which grow there.\r\n\r\n[2570] Segimundus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. cap. 57.\r\n\r\n[2571] Ægimerus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. cap. 71.\r\n\r\n[2572] Acrumerus, according to the correction of Cluverius. He is\r\nActumerus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. xi. 16, 17.\r\n\r\n[2573] MSS. Batti, which Vossius reckons were the Batavi.\r\n\r\n[2574] Cluverius considers these were the Marsi of Tacitus, Annal. lib.\r\nii. cap. 25.\r\n\r\n[2575] Called Tubantes by the Roman writers.\r\n\r\n[2576] Schwartz Wald, or Black Forest.\r\n\r\n[2577] The Lake Constance.\r\n\r\n[2578] Strabo could hardly have intended 300, since the diameter of the\r\nlake is given at 200. Velser conjectures that 500 or 600 would be the\r\nproper reading. Its exact circumference is about 550 stadia.\r\n\r\n[2579] Gossellin considers that by Keltica we are to understand\r\nCisalpine Gaul, and the neighbourhood of Milan and Mantua.\r\n\r\n[2580] Gossellin says that the sources of the Danube are about 14\r\nleagues distant from the western extremity of the Lake Constance.\r\n\r\n[2581] The Rhæti possessed the countries of the Grisons and the Tyrol,\r\nextending to the eastern shores of the Lake Constance.\r\n\r\n[2582] The Helvetii, or Swiss, possessed the southern borders of the\r\nLake Constance.\r\n\r\n[2583] The Vindelici occupied the country on the northern borders of the\r\nlake, with the regions of Swabia and Bavaria south of the Danube, and\r\nreaching to the Inn. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[2584] It is evident that some words have been omitted in this place.\r\nThe words we have inserted are the conjecture of Cluverius and Groskurd.\r\n\r\n[2585] As far as we can make out from Strabo and Pliny, book iii. cap.\r\n27, the desert of the Boii stretched along the shores of the Danube from\r\nthe river Inn to the mountains a little west of Vienna, which were the\r\nboundary between the Norici and the Pannonians. This strip of land is\r\nnow called the Wiener-Wald, or Forest of Vienna. Doubtless it took its\r\nname of Desert of the Boii on account of its contiguity to the south of\r\nthe country occupied by those people, and which still bears the name of\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\n[2586] The Pannonians occupied the districts of Hungary west of the\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\n[2587] The Norici inhabited that part of Austria which lies between the\r\nDanube and the Alps.\r\n\r\n[2588] The Insubri occupied the Milanese.\r\n\r\n[2589] The Carni have left their name to Carniola.\r\n\r\n[2590] See also book ii. chap. 3, § 6. Festus relates that the Ambrones\r\nabandoned their country on account of this tide. The Ambrones were a\r\ntribe of the Helvetii, and more than once joined with the Cimbri.\r\n\r\n[2591] The French translation has happily paraphrased, not translated,\r\nthis passage as follows: “For although it is true that the ocean has\r\ntides of more or less height, still they occur periodically, and in an\r\norder constantly the same.”\r\n\r\n[2592] Aristotle, Ethics, Eudem. lib. iii. cap. 1, Nicolas of Damascus,\r\nand Ælian, Var. Histor. lib. xii. cap. 23, have attributed the like\r\nextravagant proceedings to the Kelts or Gauls. Nicolas of Damascus,\r\nReliq. pp. 272, 273, says that the Kelts resist the tides of the ocean\r\nwith their swords in their hands, till they perish in the waters, in\r\norder that they may not seem to fear death by taking the precaution to\r\nfly.\r\n\r\n[2593] It is probable that Clitarchus obtained his information from the\r\nGauls. As for the sudden influx of the tide, there are several other\r\nexamples of the kind, in which the troops surprised were not so\r\nsuccessful in getting off.\r\n\r\n[2594] Tacitus, De Morib. Germanor. cap. viii., says that these\r\npriestesses were held in great reputation, and mentions one Veleda as\r\n“diu apud plerosque numinis loco habitam.”\r\n\r\n[2595] Pliny, lib. xix. cap. 1, describes this carbasus as very fine\r\nflax, grown in the neighbourhood of Tarragona in Spain. The Père\r\nHardouin considers that the carbasus or fabric manufactured of this flax\r\nwas similar to the French _batiste_.—The flax and the fabric were alike\r\ncalled carbasus.\r\n\r\n[2596] The Sicambri, or Sugambri, dwelt to the south of the Lippe.\r\n\r\n[2597] The Cimbri occupied Jutland, the ancient Cimbrica Chersonesus.\r\n\r\n[2598] The shores of the Baltic.\r\n\r\n[2599] Gossellin places the Jazyges in the southern districts of the\r\nUkraine, between the Dniester and the Sea of Azoff.\r\n\r\n[2600] Gossellin considers that the name of Russia is derived from these\r\nRoxolani.\r\n\r\n[2601] The Bastarnæ and Tyregetæ, mentioned in chap. i. § 1, of this\r\nbook, to whom, in book ii. chap. v. § 30, Strabo adds also the\r\nSauromatæ.\r\n\r\n[2602] The Sauromatæ, or Sarmatians, living to the east of the Sea of\r\nAzoff and along the banks of the Don.\r\n\r\n[2603] The term Atlantic was applied with much more latitude by Strabo\r\nand Eratosthenes than by us.\r\n\r\n[2604] But he himself turned back his shining eyes apart, looking\r\ntowards the land of the equestrian Thracians and the close-fighting\r\nMysians. Iliad xiii. 3.\r\n\r\n[2605] The Strait of the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[2606] Milkers of mares.\r\n\r\n[2607] People who live on milk.\r\n\r\n[2608] Devoid of riches.\r\n\r\n[2609] Dwelling in waggons.\r\n\r\n[2610] Perhaps Teurisci.\r\n\r\n[2611] A note in the French translation suggests that Capnobatæ has some\r\nconnexion with the practice of intoxication by inhaling smoke, and of\r\nusing the vapour of linseed, burned upon red-hot stones, as a bath. See\r\nHerodot. book i. chap. 202; book iv. chap. 75.\r\n\r\n[2612] And the illustrious Hippemolgi, milk-nourished, simple in living\r\nand most just men. Iliad xiii. 5.\r\n\r\n[2613] δεκάτῳ, text: but there is no doubt it should be the thirteenth.\r\n\r\n[2614] People without life.\r\n\r\n[2615] The Greek is ἀνεστίους, literally “without hearths.”\r\n\r\n[2616] Strabo does not intend by the word κυνισμὸς, which he here uses,\r\nthe profession of a Cynic philosopher, which some of the Stoics affected\r\nin consequence of their not thoroughly understanding the dogmas of Zeno,\r\nthe founder of their sect. It was to these ultra-Stoics that the name of\r\nStoaces [Στόακες] was given by way of ridicule. Athenæus, book xiii.\r\nchap. 2, remarks that a like propensity to overdo the precept of the\r\nteacher led the disciples of Aristippus, who recommended rational\r\npleasures, to become mere libertines.\r\n\r\n[2617] Heraclides of Pontus, page 215, gives them even as many as thirty\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n[2618] Kramer reads δαπάναις, which we have rendered by “expenses,” but\r\nall manuscripts have ἀπάταις. The French translation gives a note with\r\nKoray’s conjecture of δαπάναις, which is supported by a very similar\r\npassage respecting Alcibiades, where Isocrates (P. I. page 354, ed.\r\nCoray) says, “He was so lavish in the sacrifices and other expenses for\r\nthe feast.” Both the French and German translations adopt the\r\nemendation.\r\n\r\n[2619] Ζάλμοξις is the reading of the Paris manuscript, No. 1393, and we\r\nshould have preferred it for the text, as more likely to be a Getæan\r\nname, but for the circumstance of his being generally written Zamolxis.\r\n\r\n[2620] D’Anville imagines that this is the modern mountain Kaszon, and\r\nthe little river of the same name on the confines of Transylvania and\r\nMoldavia.\r\n\r\n[2621] See Strabo’s former remarks on this identical subject, book i.\r\nchap. ii. § 3, page 25.\r\n\r\n[2622] εἰς τὸν Πόντον.\r\n\r\n[2623] Ister.\r\n\r\n[2624] Tanais.\r\n\r\n[2625] Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2626] Hypanis.\r\n\r\n[2627] Phasis.\r\n\r\n[2628] Thermodon.\r\n\r\n[2629] Halys.\r\n\r\n[2630] Gossellin observes, that these must have been the Scythians\r\ninhabiting the Taurica Chersonesus, now the Crimea. The people on the\r\nopposite or southern shore were less savage. The Ionians had made\r\nsettlements amongst these as early as the sixth century B.

Histor. book iii. chap. 18, says that Theopompus\r\nrelated an interview between Midas, king of Phrygia, and Silenus, in\r\nwhich Silenus reported the existence of an immense continent, larger\r\nthan Asia, Europe, and Africa taken together, and that amongst others a\r\nrace of men called Meropes occupied several extensive cities there.\r\n\r\n[2640] Ephorus speaks of the Cimmerii who dwelt round the Lake Avernus.\r\nSee Strabo, book v. chap. iv. § 5, page 263.\r\n\r\n[2641] See Strabo, book ii. chap. iv. § 2, page 158.\r\n\r\n[2642] A note in the French translation says that this place has not\r\nbeen identified in the works of Aristotle now remaining, and suggests\r\nthat there may be some error in the text.\r\n\r\n[2643] See what Strabo has said on this subject in book i. chap. ii. §\r\n37, pp. 70, 71.\r\n\r\n[2644] Strabo will speak further on the subject of Gerena in book viii.\r\nchap. iii. § 7, and § 29.\r\n\r\n[2645] Reference is here made to the epithet ἀκάκητα, which Homer\r\napplies to Mercury, Iliad xvi. 185. The grammarians explain it correctly\r\nas “free from evil,” or “who neither does nor suffers wrong.” However,\r\nthere were some who interpreted it differently. They maintain that\r\nMercury was so called from a cavern in Arcadia, called Acacesium, (see\r\nSchol. in Homer, edit. Villois. pag. 382,) which was situated near\r\nCyllene, a mountain of Arcadia, where he was born. See Apollodor.\r\nBiblioth. lib. iii. cap. x. § 2. Hesiod, however, applies the same\r\nepithet to Prometheus, (Theogon. verse 613,) who, according to the\r\nscholiast, was thus designated from Acacesium, a mountain, not a cavern,\r\nof Arcadia, where he was greatly revered.\r\n\r\n[2646] Homer, Iliad iii. verse 201, in speaking of Ulysses, says, Ὃς\r\nτράφη ἐν δήμῳ Ἰθάκης. Some writers affirmed that the Δῆμος was the name\r\nof a place in Ithaca, while others think it a word, and understand the\r\npassage “who was bred in the country of Ithaca.” On comparing this\r\npassage with others, Iliad xvi. vss. 437, 514, and with a parallel\r\nexpression of Hesiod Theogon. verse 971, one is greatly astonished at\r\nthe ignorance and eccentricity of those who sought to make a place Demus\r\nout of this passage of Homer.\r\n\r\n[2647] According to some, Pelethronium was a city of Thessaly; according\r\nto others, it was a mountain there, or even a part of Mount Pelion.\r\n\r\n[2648] There is no mention of any Glaucopium throughout the writings of\r\nHomer. Eustathius, on the Odyssey, book ii. page 1451, remarks that it\r\nwas from the epithet γλαυκῶπις, blue-eyed or fierce-eyed, which he so\r\noften gives to Minerva, that the citadel at Athens was called the\r\nGlaucopium, while Stephen of Byzantium, on Ἀλαλκομένιον, asserts that\r\nboth the epithet γλαυκῶπις and the name of the citadel Glaucopium comes\r\nfrom Glaucopus, the son of Alalcomeneus.\r\n\r\n[2649] And the close-fighting Mysians, and the illustrious Hippemolgi,\r\nmilk-nourished, _simple in living_, and most just of men. Iliad xiii. 5.\r\nThe word which Cowper renders “blest with length of days,” and Buckley\r\n“simple in living,” is ἄβιοι. Its signification is very uncertain. Some\r\npropose to derive it from α, privative, and βιὸς, a bow, or bowless;\r\nwhile others regard it as a proper name, Abii. In Lucian’s Dialogues of\r\nthe Dead, xv. 3, it means, without a living, poor, as derived from α,\r\nprivative, and βίος, a means of living, livelihood. Cowper’s meaning is\r\nmade up from α, intensive, and βίος, life.\r\n\r\n[2650] Pontus Axenus.\r\n\r\n[2651] This word is corrupt in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[2652] He was called Idanthyrsus. See Herodotus, book iv. chap. 127.\r\n\r\n[2653] Satyrus is supplied by Koray. See also chapter iv. of this book,\r\n§ 4, and book xi. chap. ii. § 7. Groskurd refers also to Diodorus, book\r\nxiv. 93, and says that Leuco was the son of Satyrus.\r\n\r\n[2654] The mountains in the north of Thrace still bear the name of\r\nEmineh-Dag, or Mount Emineh, at their eastern point; but the western\r\nportion is called the Balkan.\r\n\r\n[2655] Piezina, at the embouchure of the Danube, between Babadag and\r\nIsmail.\r\n\r\n[2656] A note in the French translation says, these were the Carni and\r\nthe Iapodes, who having followed Sigovesus, in the reign of the elder\r\nTarquin, had taken up their abode in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic;\r\nand refers to the Examen Critique des Anciens Historiens d’Alexandre, by\r\nM. de Sainte Croix, page 855.\r\n\r\n[2657] Diodorus Siculus, in Excerpt. Peiresc. pag. 257; Memnon apud\r\nPhotium, cod. 214, cap. 6; and Plutarch, in Demetrio, § 39 and 52,\r\nconfirm what Strabo says here of the manner in which Dromichætes treated\r\nLysimachus.\r\n\r\n[2658] This is not in Plato’s Republic, but in his fourth book of Laws.\r\n\r\n[2659] This passage, if it is the writing of Strabo, and not the\r\nmarginal note of some learned reader, should doubtless be transferred\r\nback to the end of § 7 of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[2660] Iliad xiii. 5. See note [2646] to page 460.\r\n\r\n[2661] Kramer quotes Nækius in proof that we should here read Xerxes\r\ninstead of Darius; and Groskurd refers to another passage in Strabo,\r\nbook xiii. chap. i. § 22.\r\n\r\n[2662] Casaubon observes that Diodorus Siculus attributes the invention\r\nof the potter’s wheel to Talus, a nephew of Dædalus, and that\r\nTheophrastus awards it to one Hyperbius of Corinth.\r\n\r\n[2663] Iliad xviii. 600. Posidonius chose to regard this passage as an\r\ninterpolation, and would not give the praise of the invention to any\r\nother than Anacharsis.\r\n\r\n[2664] ἀβίους.\r\n\r\n[2665] Iliad xiii. 5.\r\n\r\n[2666] See chap. iii. § 3, 4, of this book.\r\n\r\n[2667] ἄνδρα γόητα, one who used a kind of howling incantation while\r\nrepeating spells.\r\n\r\n[2668] See book vii. chap. iii. § 5, page 456.\r\n\r\n[2669] Gossellin observes that the Dacians did not extend to the sources\r\nof the Danube, but to Bohemia, near the middle of the course of the\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\n[2670] Gossellin seems to think that these Daæ are identical with the\r\ninhabitants of Daghistan. Davus is not found as the name of a slave\r\namongst the Greeks till after the conquests of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[2671] Hyrcania comprehended the Corcan and Daghistan.\r\n\r\n[2672] From Lydia and Syria.\r\n\r\n[2673] Μάρισος ποταμός.\r\n\r\n[2674] ὁ Δανούιος.\r\n\r\n[2675] ὁ Ἴστρος. Stephen of Byzantium says that the Ister was called\r\nΔάνουβις, and that in very ancient times it was called Matoas. According\r\nto Ptolemy the lower part of the Danube was called Ister from Axiopolis,\r\nnow Rassovat; according to Agathemerus, from Vienna.\r\n\r\n[2676] Σαυρομάται.\r\n\r\n[2677] The ancient Tyras.\r\n\r\n[2678] Bessarabia and the southern part of Moldavia.\r\n\r\n[2679] Peter the Great, at the beginning of the last century, incurred\r\nthe risk of falling into the hands of the Turks almost on the same spot\r\nwhere Darius and Lysimachus had been in distress.\r\n\r\n[2680] Now Piczina.\r\n\r\n[2681] Ammianus Marcellinus, book xxii. chap. 8, gives the names of\r\nthese mouths. He calls the Sacred Mouth by the name of the island Peuce.\r\n\r\n[2682] There has been much geographical change in this locality since\r\nStrabo wrote.\r\n\r\n[2683] The Tyras.\r\n\r\n[2684] Gossellin supports this distance.\r\n\r\n[2685] The Lake Ovidovo.\r\n\r\n[2686] Now Akkerman.\r\n\r\n[2687] Gossellin could not identify Niconia with any modern town.\r\nGroskurd marks it as destroyed.\r\n\r\n[2688] Groskurd identifies this with Palanka.\r\n\r\n[2689] Groskurd calls this Ilan-Adassi, or Schlangeninsel. Gossellin\r\nlikewise translates Ilan-Adassi as “Isle of Serpents.”\r\n\r\n[2690] The ancient Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2691] Gossellin considers that Strabo wrote 1600 stadia, for at that\r\ndistance from the sea there are cataracts which stop the ships that come\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\n[2692] Strabo’s word is Ὕπανις. Gossellin observes that we should look\r\nfor the Ὕπανις to the east of the Dnieper, while the Bog lies to the\r\nwest of that river.\r\n\r\n[2693] Gossellin identifies this island with the modern Berezan.\r\n\r\n[2694] Now the Dnieper.\r\n\r\n[2695] Olbia, or Olbiopolis, would, according to this measure, be about\r\nthe junction of the Bog and Dnieper.\r\n\r\n[2696] Mannert has attempted to read Γεωργοί, because Herodotus, book\r\niv. chap. 18, has so termed those Scythians who cultivated their fields.\r\nIs it not possible that the Latin Regii was the word Strabo had in his\r\nmind?\r\n\r\n[2697] Piczina.\r\n\r\n[2698] Some MSS. read this name Ῥωξανοί, others Ῥοξανοί, and others\r\nῬωξοανοί, but whether there is any distinction to be drawn between these\r\nand the Ῥωξαλανοί of book ii. chap. v. § 7, is not to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n[2699] The Tanais.\r\n\r\n[2700] The Sea of Zabache.\r\n\r\n[2701] The Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2702] The Gulf of Perecop, called also Olou-Degniz. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[2703] The Isthmus of Perecop, which connects the Peninsula of Crimea,\r\nthe ancient Taurica Chersonesus.\r\n\r\n[2704] The Strait of Zabache, or Iéni-Kalé.\r\n\r\n[2705] Panticapæum, now Kertsch or Wospor in Europe.\r\n\r\n[2706] Phanagoria was on the Asiatic coast of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\n[2707] We entirely agree with Kramer in favouring Coray’s emendation of\r\nπλοῦν for πηλόν, the reading of MSS.\r\n\r\n[2708] Herodotus, book iv. chap. 53, says this fishing was carried on in\r\nthe Dnieper. Ælian, de Natur. Animal. book xiv. chap. 26, refers it to\r\nthe Danube.\r\n\r\n[2709] Strabo has before alluded to this fact, book ii. chap. i. § 16,\r\np. 114.\r\n\r\n[2710] Lucian, in Macrob. § 10, spells his name Anteas, and relates that\r\nhe was killed in this war when upwards of 90 years of age.\r\n\r\n[2711] Father of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[2712] The Island of Berezan.\r\n\r\n[2713] M. Gossellin identifies this as Cape Czile.\r\n\r\n[2714] 190 toises.\r\n\r\n[2715] 63½ toises.\r\n\r\n[2716] The Dromos Achillis is pretty well laid down in D’Anville’s Orbis\r\nRomani Pars Orientalis, 1764, but at present it presents a very\r\ndifferent appearance.\r\n\r\n[2717] There is a note by Gossellin in the French translation to the\r\nfollowing effect. The western part of this strip of land is known as the\r\nIsland of Tendra, because it is separated by a cut. The eastern part of\r\nthe strip is called Djarilgatch. The entire length of the tongue of land\r\nis 800 Olympic stadia, the two extremities are a little farther from the\r\nmainland than Strabo says, and the isthmus is about 50 Olympic stadia\r\nbroad. D’Anville has run this isthmus through the tongue of land, and\r\njutting out into the sea, so as to form a cape, which he also calls\r\nTendra, and which would answer to the Tamyraca of Strabo. In the most\r\nrecent maps there is no trace of this cape, but we see the port of which\r\nStrabo speaks. As these tongues of land are composed of a shifting sand,\r\nthey may experience alterations of form and variations of extent.\r\n\r\n[2718] Gossellin observes that the direction of the Gulf Carcinites, or\r\nGulf of Perecop, is from west to east, with a slight inclination towards\r\nthe north, on arriving from the south. Its northern shore commences at\r\nthe isthmus of the Course of Achilles, and would measure about 1000\r\nOlympic stadia if we were to follow all the sinuosities.\r\n\r\n[2719] Perekop. The isthmus is about 5½ miles across, according to M.\r\nHuot’s map, which accompanies Prince Demidoff’s Travels in Russia.\r\n\r\n[2720] The Crimea.\r\n\r\n[2721] The Sivash, or Putrid Lake. It communicates at the present day,\r\nnot by a large opening, but by the narrow strait of Yenitche, or Tonka,\r\nwith the Sea of Azof, (the Palus Mæotis,) from which it is separated by\r\nthe Tonka, or Tongue of Arabat.\r\n\r\n[2722] ῥαπτοῖς πλοίοις. Boats probably composed of frame-work covered\r\nwith hides.\r\n\r\n[2723] Casaubon suggests, and Gossellin adopts, the reading καλὸς λιμὴν,\r\nFair Haven, for ἄλλος λιμὴν, another harbour. Whatever harbour was\r\nmeant, its situation is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[2724] Tereklias.\r\n\r\n[2725] The ancient Tyras.\r\n\r\n[2726] In speaking of the Virgin as “some goddess,” it may be doubted\r\nwhether Diana is here meant, or some Scythian or Eastern divinity.\r\nParthenium, a village, is mentioned, c. 4, 5. The scene of the Iphigenia\r\nin Tauris of Euripides is laid some where on these shores.\r\n\r\n[2727] The New Chersonesus, Cape Cherson, and the three small harbours\r\nnear Khut.\r\n\r\n[2728] The Heracleotic Chersonese was comprehended in the triangle\r\nformed by Ctenus, (Inkerman,) Parthenium, (Cape Cherson,) and Symbolon\r\nLimen (Baluklava). The Gulf of Ctenus is now the Gulf of Sebastopol, a\r\nname substituted for that of Akhtiar in the time of Catherine II. of\r\nRussia. On the first small bay to the west of the town of Sebastopol,\r\nwas situated the New city Chersonesus, flourishing in the time of\r\nStrabo; the Old Chersonesus, described as in ruins, was situated on the\r\nsmall peninsula, the extreme western point of which is Cape Cherson.\r\nBoth here and in various parts of the Crimea were very interesting\r\nremains of antiquity, but Dr. Clarke complains of their wanton\r\ndestruction. Ctenus is probably derived from κτενώδης, “like a comb,”\r\ndescriptive of the indented nature of the gulf. Both Gossellin and\r\nD’Anville have mistaken the true position of the Heracleotic Chersonese.\r\n\r\n[2729] So named after the wife or sister of Leucon. _C._ Now Kaffa.\r\n\r\n[2730] Cape Aia and Cape Keremp.\r\n\r\n[2731] The opposite coasts are not visible from the middle passage.\r\n\r\n[2732] The engraving in Pallas shows it to be, as the name implies, a\r\ntable mountain, now Tchadir-Dagh, or Tent Mountain.\r\n\r\n[2733] Trebizond.\r\n\r\n[2734] The name seems to be preserved in that of one of the districts\r\nnear the mountains, Eski-Krim. _G._ In Prince Demidoff’s map it is\r\ncalled Staröi-Krime.\r\n\r\n[2735] Kertch.\r\n\r\n[2736] The Sea of Azof.\r\n\r\n[2737] Caffa.\r\n\r\n[2738] i. e. from Kertch to Taman, or from Yeni-kaleh near Kertch to\r\nTaman. Prince Gleb, son of Vladimir, A. D. 1065, measured this latter\r\ndistance on the ice, and found it to be 30,057 Russian fathoms, or\r\nnearly 12 miles. Here the battle was fought on the ice. See chap. iii. §\r\n18.\r\n\r\n[2739] The Tanais.\r\n\r\n[2740] According to modern maps, the Don separates into two branches,\r\nand there again into several others, which form the mouths of the river.\r\nThe extreme branches are at a considerable distance from each other.\r\n\r\n[2741] Azof.\r\n\r\n[2742] Yeni-kaleh.\r\n\r\n[2743] Kazandib.\r\n\r\n[2744] The amount is enormous, if it refers to the quantity of corn\r\nshipped in a single year. Neither manuscripts nor translations afford\r\nany various reading. The abbreviator, however, instead of 2,100,000,\r\n(μυριάδας μεδίμνων διακοσίας καὶ δέκα,) gives 150,000 (μεδίμνους\r\nΜΥΡΙΑΔΑΣ ΙΕ). But instead of correcting Strabo by his abbreviator, it is\r\nmore probable that the text of the latter should be changed to\r\n2,100,000, or even to 2,150,000 (ΜΥΡΙΑΔΑΣ ΣΙΕ). Bréquigny, by an\r\noversight, or because he thought proper to change the ΜΥΡΙΑΔΑΣ of the\r\ntext to ΧΙΛΙΑΔΑΣ, translates 210,000 medimni. However it may be, we know\r\nfrom Demosthenes, that this same prince of the Bosporus mentioned by\r\nStrabo, sent annually to Athens 400,000 medimni of corn, a quantity far\r\nbelow that mentioned in the text. To reconcile these authors, Mr. Wolf\r\nsupposes that we ought to understand by 2,100,000 medimni of corn, the\r\nshipment made in the year of the great famine, which occurred in the\r\n105th Olympiad, (about 360 B. C.,) and of which Demosthenes speaks in a\r\nmanner to give us to understand, that the quantity sent that year by\r\nLeucon greatly exceeded that of former years. A very probable\r\nconjecture. _F. T._ The medimnus was about 1½ bushel.\r\n\r\n[2745] ὄψημα.\r\n\r\n[2746] ἀβίους.\r\n\r\n[2747] I have adopted the reading suggested by the F. T., Πύργους καθ’\r\nἕκαστα στάδια δέκα.

See chap. v. § 12.\r\n\r\n[2759] At the confluence of the Kulpa and the Save, afterwards Siscia,\r\nnow Sizsek.\r\n\r\n[2760] Occupied the coast of Morlacca from the Gulf of Quarnero to Zara.\r\n\r\n[2761] According to Pliny, the name of this place is derived from the\r\nfable of the ship Argo, which was brought up the Danube and the Save,\r\nand thence carried on men’s shoulders to the Adriatic. Now Porto Quieto.\r\n\r\n[2762] To the north of Trieste.\r\n\r\n[2763] Trieste.\r\n\r\n[2764] Carniola.\r\n\r\n[2765] The Czirknitz-See.\r\n\r\n[2766] The Kulpa.\r\n\r\n[2767] Gulf of Cataro.\r\n\r\n[2768] Now celebrated for the remains of a Roman amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[2769] Ancona.\r\n\r\n[2770] The Venetian territory.\r\n\r\n[2771] I am not acquainted with the sites of these places. _G._\r\n\r\n[2772] Ζειᾷ καὶ κέγχρῳ.\r\n\r\n[2773] Scardona.\r\n\r\n[2774] The Kerka.\r\n\r\n[2775] The modern names of these numerous islands must be matter of\r\nconjecture. Issa is Lissa.\r\n\r\n[2776] Salona.\r\n\r\n[2777] Inhabitants, probably, of the peninsula Sabioncello.\r\n\r\n[2778] Curzola.\r\n\r\n[2779] Varalii, MSS.; but manifestly wrong.\r\n\r\n[2780] Risano in the Gulf of Cataro.\r\n\r\n[2781] The river Drin.\r\n\r\n[2782] Kramer suggests the omission of these words, which render the\r\npassage obscure.\r\n\r\n[2783] Galabrii. The name of this people is unknown. Probably it should\r\nbe changed to Taulantii, an Illyrian tribe, or considered as a second\r\nname of the Taulantii, or that of a tribe belonging to them. The name\r\nGalabrus, or Galaurus, king of the Taulantii, has come down to us, which\r\ngives some probability to the second conjecture. _C._\r\n\r\n[2784] The Mædi occupied the mountains which separate Macedonia from\r\nThrace, between the river Strymon and Mount Rhodope. _G._\r\n\r\n[2785] The Gulf of Cataro.\r\n\r\n[2786] Alesso.\r\n\r\n[2787] A fortified rock near.\r\n\r\n[2788] Durazzo.\r\n\r\n[2789] Ergent, or Beratino.\r\n\r\n[2790] Lao, or Vousoutza.\r\n\r\n[2791] Polina. Thucydides calls Apollonia a colony of the Corinthians,\r\nand not of the Corinthians and Corcyræans. He states it, however, (b. i.\r\nc. 24,) to have been the practice for colonies which in their turn\r\nfounded other colonies, to unite with them, on these occasions, citizens\r\nof the mother city.\r\n\r\n[2792] One of the peaks of Pindus.\r\n\r\n[2793] Amphilochian Argos, now Filochia. _G._\r\n\r\n[2794] On the boundary of Cilicia and Syria.\r\n\r\n[2795] Appear to have been situated on the Gulf of Valona. _G._\r\n\r\n[2796] The name, Ionian Gulf, appears to have extended from the\r\nAcroceraunian mountains to the southern part of Dalmatia, near Lissus,\r\nnow Alessio, to the bottom of the Gulf of Drin. _G._\r\n\r\n[2797] The word Αδρίας is translated Adriatic.

The Triballi, at the time alluded to\r\nby Strabo, possessed nearly the whole of the country included between\r\nthe Adriatic and the Euxine. The Scordisci, who were at first confined\r\nto the territory situated between the Drave and the Save, in their turn\r\ntook possession of all this country. It is not possible, in consequence\r\nof the continual wars which existed amongst these people, to determine\r\nwith exactness the places which they successively occupied. _G._\r\n\r\n[2802] Probably the Save. _G._\r\n\r\n[2803] Mædi.\r\n\r\n[2804] Cities not identified.\r\n\r\n[2805] The Dobrudscha.\r\n\r\n[2806] Mangalia, Tomesvar, the place of Ovid’s exile, Kara-Herman.\r\n\r\n[2807] Istropolis or Kara-Herman.\r\n\r\n[2808] Tomesvar.\r\n\r\n[2809] Mangalia.\r\n\r\n[2810] Sizepoli.\r\n\r\n[2811] Baltchik, near Kavarna.\r\n\r\n[2812] Varna.\r\n\r\n[2813] Cape Emineh—in the English charts Emona, but there is no fixed\r\nsystem of spelling for names of places in this part of the world. Emineh\r\nis probably a corruption of Hæmus.\r\n\r\n[2814] Missemvria.\r\n\r\n[2815] Or Meneburgh, we should say. The Thracian was a language cognate\r\nwith that of the Getæ; see Strabo, book vii. chap. iii. § 10; and the\r\nGetæ were Gothic. We have the Liber Aureus in the Moeso Gothic language\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n[2816] Ahiolou.\r\n\r\n[2817] Places no longer known. _G._\r\n\r\n[2818] In the English charts Kyanees. They do not correspond to the\r\ndescription here given. The well-known poetical name is Symplegades.\r\n\r\n[2819] In Italian, Pelamide, or Palamide, well known in the\r\nMediterranean. It is not to be compared in size to the Thunny, but is\r\nmuch larger than the Mackerel, of a dark blue and streaked. Like the\r\nThunny, it is migratory. Aristotle erroneously conjectures the Pelamide\r\nto be the young of the Thunny.\r\n\r\n[2820] The ancient Byzantium, there are grounds for believing, was\r\nmarked by the present walls of the Seraglio. The enlarged city was\r\nfounded by the emperor Constantine, A. D. 328, who gave it his name, and\r\nmade it the rival of Rome itself. It was taken from the Greeks in 1204,\r\nby the Venetians under Dandolo; retaken by the Greeks in 1261 under the\r\nemperor Michael Palæologus, and conquered by the Turks in 1453. The\r\ncrescent found on some of the ancient Byzantine coins was adopted as a\r\nsymbol by the Turks.\r\n\r\n[2821] B. C. 1570. He was king of Argos.\r\n\r\n[2822] The Peloponnesus, which before the arrival of Pelops was called\r\nApia.\r\n\r\n[2823] Eumolpus took possession of Eleusis B. C. 1400. He is said to\r\nhave there instituted the mysteries of Ceres.\r\n\r\n[2824] Cadmus, son of Agenor, king of Tyre, arrived in Bœotia B. C.\r\n1550. The citadel of Thebes was named after him.\r\n\r\n[2825] Sues, Σύας, swine, in allusion to their ignorance.\r\n\r\n[2826] There were two kings of Athens named Cecrops. The first of this\r\nname, first king of Attica and Bœotia, came from Egypt. Cecrops II. was\r\nthe 7th, and Codrus the 17th and last king of Attica. Strabo informs us,\r\nb. x. c. i. § 3, that Œclus and Cothus were brothers of Ellops, who\r\nfounded Ellopia in Eubœa, and gave the name to the whole island.\r\n\r\n[2827] B. v. c. ii. § 4.\r\n\r\n[2828] The capture of Troy by Hercules. See Grote i. 388.\r\n\r\n[2829] B. C. 168.\r\n\r\n[2830] Ipsala.\r\n\r\n[2831] Maritza.\r\n\r\n[2832] D’Anville (Mesures Itineraires) conjectures the difference\r\nbetween Polybius and Strabo to arise from the Greek foot being less than\r\nthe Roman foot in the ratio of 24 to 25; or 24 Roman stadia = 25 Greek\r\nstadia containing the same number of feet.\r\n\r\n[2833] Polina.\r\n\r\n[2834] Durazzo.\r\n\r\n[2835] Lago d’ Ochrida.\r\n\r\n[2836] Vodina.\r\n\r\n[2837] The ruins of Pella are at a little distance on the east of the\r\nlake Tenidscheh.\r\n\r\n[2838] Salonica.\r\n\r\n[2839] Gulf of Arta.\r\n\r\n[2840] Iemboli.\r\n\r\n[2841] Balkan applies to the whole mountainous range of Hæmus; Emineh to\r\nthe part bordering on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n[2842] Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[2843] Gulf of Saros.\r\n\r\n[2844] Cape Colonna.\r\n\r\n[2845] Karasu, or Mesta.\r\n\r\n[2846] The site of Dodona is unknown.\r\n\r\n[2847] Panormo.\r\n\r\n[2848] Santi Quaranta.\r\n\r\n[2849] Corfu.\r\n\r\n[2850] Cassiopo.\r\n\r\n[2851] Brindisi.\r\n\r\n[2852] Butrinto.\r\n\r\n[2853] Syvota.\r\n\r\n[2854] C. Bianco.\r\n\r\n[2855] The Thyamus, or Thyamis, is now called Glycys, and the Acheron,\r\nCalamas.\r\n\r\n[2856] Sopoto.\r\n\r\n[2857] Porto Fanari.\r\n\r\n[2858] The ruins of Nicopolis are to the north of Prevesa.\r\n\r\n[2859] Cæsar Augustus (then Cæsar Octavianus) obtained the celebrated\r\nvictory of Actium over Marcus Antonius, B. C. 31. The latter, after his\r\ndefeat, fled into Egypt with Cleopatra. The battle would appear to have\r\ntaken place at the entrance into the Gulf of Arta, and therefore\r\nprobably off La Punta, opposite Prevesa, and not off the modern town of\r\nAzio.\r\n\r\n[2860] In the Austrian map a ground-plan of the ruins of Nicopolis are\r\ngiven, at about one mile to the north of Prevesa.\r\n\r\n[2861] The Gulf of Ambracia, and the rivers which flow into it, are much\r\ndistorted in D’Anville. According to more modern maps, the Arathus is\r\nthe most western of the streams which flow into the gulf, and the\r\nancient city was situated at about 15 miles from the mouth. The Lorn\r\n(the Arathus); the Mauro Potamo or Glykys (the Acheron); the Zagura (the\r\nSelleis?) which falls into it; and the Tercino, which falls into the\r\nKalamas, (the Thyamis or Thyamus,) all rise in the mountain ridge\r\nOlytkiza, about 10 miles to the west of Ianina.\r\n\r\n[2862] Livy xxxviii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2863] Virg. Æn. iii. 280.\r\n\r\n[2864] Descendants of the seven chiefs who fought and perished before\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\n[2865] These nations are mentioned by other authors; they were probably\r\nseparated by the numerous mountain ridges to the west of Pindus. See\r\nbelow, § 9. But compare D’Anville and the Austrian military map.\r\n\r\n[2866] Alcomenæ.\r\n\r\n[2867] Styberra, _Polyb._; Stubera, _Liv._; Stobera, _Suid._\r\n\r\n[2868] Iliad, book xvi. 233.\r\n\r\n[2869] ὑποφῆται.\r\n\r\n[2870] τομοῦροι.\r\n\r\n[2871] Odys. xvi. 403.\r\n\r\n[2872] τομούρους.\r\n\r\n[2873] θέμιστας.\r\n\r\n[2874] βουλαί.\r\n\r\n[2875] τομούρους.\r\n\r\n[2876] τομαρούρους.\r\n\r\n[2877] βουλὴν.\r\n\r\n[2878] ὑποφῆται.\r\n\r\n[2879] προφῆται.\r\n\r\n[2880] The Fragments are collected from the Palatine (EPIT.) and Vatican\r\n(E.) Epitomes; and, in the opinion of Kramer, much is not lost. By the\r\ndiligence and research of Kramer, the former length of these Fragments\r\nis more than doubled; but for a more particular account of his labours,\r\nthe reader is referred to his preface and notes.\r\n\r\n[2881] This proverb is quoted in Plutarch’s Life of Lycurgus.\r\n\r\n[2882] Indesche Karasu.\r\n\r\n[2883] Oxas.\r\n\r\n[2884] Ipsala.\r\n\r\n[2885] The Maritza.\r\n\r\n[2886] Schar-dagh.\r\n\r\n[2887] Egrisou-dagh.\r\n\r\n[2888] Despoto-dagh.\r\n\r\n[2889] Veliki-dagh.\r\n\r\n[2890] Above Agios-Mamas, in the Bay of Cassandra.\r\n\r\n[2891] The Gallico.\r\n\r\n[2892] Kramer quotes the following passage from Eustathius: “In the\r\npassage ἐπικίδναται αἴῃ, or αἶαν, (for there are two readings,) some\r\nhave understood αἶαv not to mean the earth, but a spring, as is evident\r\nfrom the words of the geographer, where he says that the Amydon of Homer\r\nwas afterwards called Abydos, but was razed. For there is a spring of\r\nclearest water near Amydon, called Æa, running into the Axius, which is\r\nitself turbid, in consequence of the numerous rivers which flow into it.\r\nThere is, therefore, he says, an error in the quotation, Ἀξίου κάλλιστον\r\nὕδωρ ἐπικίδναται αἴῃ, as it is clearly not the Axius which diffuses\r\nits water over the spring, but the contrary. The geographer rather\r\nintemperately finds fault with the supposition of αἶαν meaning the\r\nearth, and seems anxious to reject altogether this reading in the\r\nHomeric poem.”\r\n\r\n[2893] Buræus.\r\n\r\n[2894] Gulf of Salonica.\r\n\r\n[2895] Cape Pailuri.\r\n\r\n[2896] The ruins of Potidæa, or Cassandria, are near Pinako.\r\n\r\n[2897] Karafaja.\r\n\r\n[2898] Monte Santo.\r\n\r\n[2899] Gulf of Zeitun.\r\n\r\n[2900] G. of Volo.\r\n\r\n[2901] G. of Salonica.\r\n\r\n[2902] G. of Cassandra.\r\n\r\n[2903] G. of Monte Santo.\r\n\r\n[2904] G. of Orfano.\r\n\r\n[2905] Cape Stauros.\r\n\r\n[2906] C.
