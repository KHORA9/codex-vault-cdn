R. Wallace—“who has since acquired wide fame in\r\nconnection with the Darwinian theory of Natural Selection”—on a joint\r\nexpedition up the river Amazons, for the purpose of investigating the\r\nNatural History of the vast wood-region traversed by that mighty river\r\nand its numerous tributaries. Mr. Wallace returned to England after\r\nfour years’ stay, and was, we believe, unlucky enough to lose the\r\ngreater part of his collections by the shipwreck of the vessel in which\r\nhe had transmitted them to London. Mr. Bates prolonged his residence in\r\nthe Amazon valley seven years after Mr. Wallace’s departure, and did\r\nnot revisit his native country again until 1859. Mr. Bates was also\r\nmore fortunate than his companion in bringing his gathered treasures\r\nhome to England in safety. So great, indeed, was the mass of specimens\r\naccumulated by Mr. Bates during his eleven years’ researches, that upon\r\nthe working out of his collection, which has been accomplished (or is\r\nnow in course of being accomplished) by different scientific\r\nnaturalists in this country, it has been ascertained that\r\nrepresentatives of no less than 14,712 _species_ are amongst them, of\r\nwhich about 8000 were previously unknown to science. It may be remarked\r\nthat by far the greater portion of these species, namely, about 14,000,\r\nbelong to the class of Insects—to the study of which Mr. Bates\r\nprincipally devoted his attention—being, as is well known, himself\r\nrecognised as no mean authority as regards this class of organic\r\nbeings. In his present volume, however, Mr. Bates does not confine\r\nhimself to his entomological discoveries, nor to any other branch of\r\nNatural History, but supplies a general outline of his adventures\r\nduring his journeyings up and down the mighty river, and a variety of\r\ninformation concerning every object of interest, whether physical or\r\npolitical, that he met with by the way.\r\n\r\nMr. Bates landed at Pará in May, 1848. His first part is entirely taken\r\nup with an account of the Lower Amazons—that is, the river from its\r\nsources up to the city of Manaos or Barra do Rio Negro, where it is\r\njoined by the large northern confluent of that name—and with a\r\nnarrative of his residence at Pará and his various excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood of that city. The large collection made by Mr. Bates of\r\nthe animal productions of Pará enabled him to arrive at the following\r\nconclusions regarding the relations of the Fauna of the south side of\r\nthe Amazonian delta with those of other regions.\r\n\r\n“It is generally allowed that Guiana and Brazil, to the north and south\r\nof the Pará district, form two distinct provinces, as regards their\r\nanimal and vegetable inhabitants. By this it means that the two regions\r\nhave a very large number of forms peculiar to themselves, and which are\r\nsupposed not to have been derived from other quarters during modern\r\ngeological times. Each may be considered as a centre of distribution in\r\nthe latest process of dissemination of species over the surface of\r\ntropical America. Pará lies midway between the two centres, each of\r\nwhich has a nucleus of elevated table-land, whilst the intermediate\r\nriver-valley forms a wide extent of low-lying country. It is,\r\ntherefore, interesting to ascertain from which the latter received its\r\npopulation, or whether it contains so large a number of endemic species\r\nas would warrant the conclusion that it is itself an independent\r\nprovince. To assist in deciding such questions as these, we must\r\ncompare closely the species found in the district with those of the\r\nother contiguous regions, and endeavour to ascertain whether they are\r\nidentical, or only slightly modified, or whether they are highly\r\npeculiar.\r\n\r\n“Von Martius when he visited this part of Brazil forty years ago,\r\ncoming from the south, was much struck with the dissimilarity of the\r\nanimal and vegetable productions to those of other parts of Brazil. In\r\nfact the Fauna of Pará, and the lower part of the Amazons has no close\r\nrelationship with that of Brazil proper; but it has a very great\r\naffinity with that of the coast region of Guiana, from Cayenne to\r\nDemerara. If we may judge from the results afforded by the study of\r\ncertain families of insects, no peculiar Brazilian forms are found in\r\nthe Pará district; whilst more than one-half of the total number are\r\nessentially Guiana species, being found nowhere else but in Guiana and\r\nAmazonia. Many of them, however, are modified from the Guiana type, and\r\nabout one-seventh seem to be restricted to Pará. These endemic species\r\nare not highly peculiar, and they may yet be found over a great part of\r\nNorthern Brazil when the country is better explored. They do not\r\nwarrant us in concluding that the district forms an independent\r\nprovince, although they show that its Fauna is not wholly derivative,\r\nand that the land is probably not entirely a new formation. From all\r\nthese facts, I think we must conclude that the Pará district belongs to\r\nthe Guiana province and that, if it is newer land than Guiana, it must\r\nhave received the great bulk of its animal population from that region.\r\nI am informed by Dr. Sclater that similar results are derivable from\r\nthe comparison of the birds of these countries.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting excursions made by Mr. Bates from Pará was\r\nthe ascent of the river Tocantins—the mouth of which lies about 45\r\nmiles from the city of Pará. This was twice attempted. On the second\r\noccasion—our author being in company with Mr. Wallace—the travellers\r\npenetrated as far as the rapids of Arroyos, about 130 miles from its\r\nmouth. This district is one of the chief collecting-grounds of the\r\nwell-known Brazil-nut (_Bertholletia excelsa_), which is here very\r\nplentiful, grove after grove of these splendid trees being visible,\r\ntowering above their fellows, with the “woody fruits, large and round\r\nas cannon-balls, dotted over the branches.” The Hyacinthine Macaw (_Ara\r\nhyacinthina_) is another natural wonder, first met with here. This\r\nsplendid bird, which is occasionally brought alive to the Zoological\r\nGardens of Europe, “only occurs in the interior of Brazil, from 16°\r\nS.L. to the southern border of the Amazon valley.” Its enormous\r\nbeak—which must strike even the most unobservant with wonder—appears to\r\nbe adapted to enable it to feed on the nuts of the Mucuja Palm\r\n(_Acrocomia lasiospatha_). “These nuts, which are so hard as to be\r\ndifficult to break with a heavy hammer, are crushed to a pulp by the\r\npowerful beak of this Macaw.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bates’ later part is mainly devoted to his residence at Santarem,\r\nat the junction of the Rio Tapajos with the main stream, and to his\r\naccount of Upper Amazon, or Solimoens—the Fauna of which is, as we\r\nshall presently see, in many respects very different from that of the\r\nlower part of the river. At Santarem—“the most important and most\r\ncivilised settlement on the Amazon, between the Atlantic and Pará”—Mr.\r\nBates made his headquarters for three years and a half, during which\r\ntime several excursions up the little-known Tapajos were effected. Some\r\n70 miles up the stream, on its affluent, the Cuparí, a new Fauna, for\r\nthe most part very distinct from that of the lower part of the same\r\nstream, was entered upon. “At the same time a considerable proportion\r\nof the Cuparí species were identical with those of Ega, on the Upper\r\nAmazon, a district eight times further removed than the village just\r\nmentioned.” Mr. Bates was more successful here than on his excursion up\r\nthe Tocantins, and obtained twenty new species of fishes, and many new\r\nand conspicuous insects, apparently peculiar to this part of the\r\nAmazonian valley.\r\n\r\nIn a later chapter Mr. Bates commences his account of the Solimoens, or\r\nUpper Amazons, on the banks of which he passed four years and a half.\r\nThe country is a “magnificent wilderness, where civilised man has, as\r\nyet, scarcely obtained a footing—the cultivated ground, from the Rio\r\nNegro to the Andes, amounting only to a few score acres.” During the\r\nwhole of this time Mr. Bates’ headquarters were at Ega, on the Teffé, a\r\nconfluent of the great river from the south, whence excursions were\r\nmade sometimes for 300 or 400 miles into the interior. In the intervals\r\nMr. Bates followed his pursuit as a collecting naturalist in the same\r\n“peaceful, regular way,” as he might have done in a European village.\r\nOur author draws a most striking picture of the quiet, secluded life he\r\nled in this far-distant spot. The difficulty of getting news and the\r\nwant of intellectual society were the great drawbacks—“the latter\r\nincreasing until it became almost insupportable.” “I was obliged at\r\nlast,” Mr. Bates naively remarks, “to come to the conclusion that the\r\ncontemplation of Nature, alone is not sufficient to fill the human\r\nheart and mind.” Mr. Bates must indeed have been driven to great\r\nstraits as regards his mental food, when, as he tell us, he took to\r\nreading the _ Athenæum_ three times over, “the first time devouring the\r\nmore interesting articles—the second, the whole of the remainder—and\r\nthe third, reading all the advertisements from beginning to end.”\r\n\r\nEga was, indeed, as Mr. Bates remarks, a fine field for a Natural\r\nHistory collector, the only previous scientific visitants to that\r\nregion having been the German Naturalists, Spix and Martius, and the\r\nCount de Castelnau when he descended the Amazons from the Pacific. Mr.\r\nBates’ account of the monkeys of the genera _Brachyurus, Nyctipithecus_\r\nand _Midas_ met with in this region, and the whole of the very pregnant\r\nremarks which follow on the American forms of the Quadrumana, will be\r\nread with interest by every one, particularly by those who pay\r\nattention to the important subject of geographical distribution. We\r\nneed hardly say that Mr. Bates, after the attention he has bestowed\r\nupon this question, is a zealous advocate of the hypothesis of the\r\norigin of species by derivation from a common stock. After giving an\r\noutline of the general distribution of Monkeys, he clearly argues that\r\nunless the “common origin at least of the species of a family be\r\nadmitted, the problem of their distribution must remain an inexplicable\r\nmystery.” Mr. Bates evidently thoroughly understands the nature of this\r\ninteresting problem, and in another passage, in which the very singular\r\ndistribution of the Butterflies of the genus _Heliconius_ is enlarged\r\nupon, concludes with the following significant remarks upon this\r\nimportant subject:—\r\n\r\n“In the controversy which is being waged amongst Naturalists since the\r\npublication of the Darwinian theory of the origin of species, it has\r\nbeen rightly said that no proof at present existed of the production of\r\na physiological species, that is, a form which will not interbreed with\r\nthe one from which it was derived, although given ample opportunities\r\nof doing so, and does not exhibit signs of reverting to its parent form\r\nwhen placed under the same conditions with it. Morphological species,\r\nthat is, forms which differ to an amount that would justify their being\r\nconsidered good species, have been produced in plenty through selection\r\nby man out of variations arising under domestication or cultivation.\r\nThe facts just given are therefore of some scientific importance, for\r\nthey tend to show that a physiological species can be and is produced\r\nin nature out of the varieties of a pre-existing closely allied one.\r\nThis is not an isolated case, for I observed in the course of my\r\ntravels a number of similar instances. But in very few has it happened\r\nthat the species which clearly appears to be the parent, co-exists with\r\none that has been evidently derived from it. Generally the supposed\r\nparent also seems to have been modified, and then the demonstration is\r\nnot so clear, for some of the links in the chain of variation are\r\nwanting. The process of origination of a species in nature as it takes\r\nplace successively, must be ever, perhaps, beyond man’s power to trace,\r\non account of the great lapse of time it requires. But we can obtain a\r\nfair view of it by tracing a variable and far-spreading species over\r\nthe wide area of its present distribution; and a long observation of\r\nsuch will lead to the conclusion that new species must in all cases\r\nhave arisen out of variable and widely-disseminated forms. It sometimes\r\nhappens, as in the present instance, that we find in one locality a\r\nspecies under a certain form which is constant to all the individuals\r\nconcerned; in another exhibiting numerous varieties; and in a third\r\npresenting itself as a constant form quite distinct from the one we set\r\nout with. If we meet with any two of these modifications living side by\r\nside, and maintaining their distinctive characters under such\r\ncircumstances, the proof of the natural origination of a species is\r\ncomplete; it could not be much more so were we able to watch the\r\nprocess step by step. It might be objected that the difference between\r\nour two species is but slight, and that by classing them as varieties\r\nnothing further would be proved by them. But the differences between\r\nthem are such as obtain between allied species generally. Large genera\r\nare composed in great part of such species, and it is interesting to\r\nshow the great and beautiful diversity within a large genus as brought\r\nabout by the working of laws within our comprehension.”\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Zoological wonders of the Upper Amazon, birds,\r\ninsects, and butterflies are all spoken of by Mr. Bates in his chapter\r\non the natural features of the district, and it is evident that none of\r\nthese classes of beings escaped the observation of his watchful\r\nintelligence. The account of the foraging ants of the genus _Eciton_ is\r\ncertainly marvellous, and would, even of itself, be sufficient to stamp\r\nthe recorder of their habits as a man of no ordinary mark.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter of Mr. Bates’ work contains the account of his\r\nexcursions beyond Ega. Fonteboa, Tunantins—a small semi-Indian\r\nsettlement, 240 miles up the stream—and San Paulo de Olivenca, some\r\nmiles higher up, were the principal places visited, and new\r\nacquisitions were gathered at each of these localities. In the fourth\r\nmonth of Mr. Bates’ residence at the last-named place, a severe attack\r\nof ague led to the abandonment of the plans he had formed of proceeding\r\nto the Peruvian towns of Pebas and Moyobamba, and “so completing the\r\nexamination of the Natural History of the Amazonian plains up to the\r\nfoot of the Andes.” This attack, which seemed to be the culmination of\r\na gradual deterioration of health, caused by eleven years’ hard work\r\nunder the tropics, induced him to return to Ega, and finally to Pará,\r\nwhere he embarked, on the 2nd June 1859, for England. Naturally enough,\r\nMr. Bates tells us he was at first a little dismayed at leaving the\r\nequator, “where the well-balanced forces of Nature maintain a\r\nland-surface and a climate typical of mind, and order and beauty,” to\r\nsail towards the “crepuscular skies” of the cold north. But he consoles\r\nus by adding the remark that “three years’ renewed experience of\r\nEngland” have convinced him “how incomParábly superior is civilised\r\nlife to the spiritual sterility of half-savage existence, even if it\r\nwere passed in the Garden of Eden.”\r\n\r\n*   *   *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of H.

It will be new to most people, that\r\nthis noble stream has recently been navigated by steamers to a distance\r\nof 2200 geographical miles from its mouth at Pará, or double the\r\ndistance which vessels are able to reach on the Yang-tze-Kiang, the\r\nlargest river of the old world; the depth of water in the dry season\r\nbeing about seven fathoms up to this terminus of navigation. It is not,\r\nhowever, the length of the trunk stream, that has earned for the\r\nAmazons the appellation of the “Mediterranean of South America,” given\r\nit by the Brazilians of Pará; but the network of by-channels and lakes,\r\nwhich everywhere accompanies its course at a distance from the banks,\r\nand which adds many thousands of miles of easy inland navigation to the\r\ntotal presented by the main river and its tributaries. The Peruvians,\r\nespecially, if I may judge from letters received within the past few\r\nweeks, seem to be stirring themselves to grasp the advantages which the\r\npossession of the upper course of the river places within their reach.\r\nVessels of heavy tonnage have arrived in Pará, from England, with\r\nmaterials for the formation of shipbuilding establishments, at a point\r\nsituated two thousand miles from the mouth of the river. Peruvian\r\nsteamers have navigated from the Andes to the Atlantic, and a quantity\r\nof cotton (now exported for the first time), the product of the rich\r\nand healthy country bordering the Upper Amazons, has been conveyed by\r\nthis means, and shipped from Pará to Europe. The probability of general\r\ncuriosity in England being excited before long with regard to this\r\nhitherto neglected country, will be considered, of itself, a sufficient\r\nreason for placing an account of its natural features and present\r\ncondition within reach of all readers.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _January_, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nPARÁ\r\n\r\nArrival — Aspect of the Country — The Pará River — First Walk in the\r\nSuburbs of Pará — Birds, Lizards, and Insects of the Suburbs —\r\nLeaf-carrying Ant — Sketch of the Climate, History, and present\r\nCondition of Pará.\r\n\r\nI embarked at Liverpool, with Mr. Wallace, in a small trading vessel,\r\non the 26th of April, 1848; and, after a swift passage from the Irish\r\nChannel to the equator, arrived, on the 26th of May, off Salinas. This\r\nis the pilot-station for vessels bound to Pará, the only port of entry\r\nto the vast region watered by the Amazons. It is a small village,\r\nformerly a missionary settlement of the Jesuits, situated a few miles\r\nto the eastward of the Pará River. Here the ship anchored in the open\r\nsea at a distance of six miles from the shore, the shallowness of the\r\nwater far out around the mouth of the great river not permitting, in\r\nsafety, a nearer approach; and, the signal was hoisted for a pilot. It\r\nwas with deep interest that my companion and myself, both now about to\r\nsee and examine the beauties of a tropical country for the first time,\r\ngazed on the land where I, at least, eventually spent eleven of the\r\nbest years of my life. To the eastward the country was not remarkable\r\nin appearance, being slightly undulating, with bare sand-hills and\r\nscattered trees; but to the westward, stretching towards the mouth of\r\nthe river, we could see through the captain’s glass a long line of\r\nforest, rising apparently out of the water; a densely-packed mass of\r\ntall trees, broken into groups, and finally into single trees, as it\r\ndwindled away in the distance. This was the frontier, in this\r\ndirection, of the great primaeval forest characteristic of this region,\r\nwhich contains so many wonders in its recesses, and clothes the whole\r\nsurface of the country for two thousand miles from this point to the\r\nfoot of the Andes.\r\n\r\nOn the following day and night we sailed, with a light wind, partly\r\naided by the tide, up the Pará river. Towards evening we passed Vigia\r\nand Colares, two fishing villages, and saw many native canoes, which\r\nseemed like toys beneath the lofty walls of dark forest. The air was\r\nexcessively close, the sky overcast, and sheet lightning played almost\r\nincessantly around the horizon—an appropriate greeting on the threshold\r\nof a country lying close under the equator! The evening was calm, this\r\nbeing the season when the winds are not strong, so we glided along in a\r\nnoiseless manner, which contrasted pleasantly with the unceasing\r\nturmoil to which we had been lately accustomed on the Atlantic. The\r\nimmensity of the river struck us greatly, for although sailing\r\nsometimes at a distance of eight or nine miles from the eastern bank,\r\nthe opposite shore was at no time visible. Indeed, the Pará river is\r\nthirty-six miles in breadth at its mouth; and at the city of Pará,\r\nnearly seventy miles from the sea, it is twenty miles wide; but at that\r\npoint, a series of islands commences which contracts the riverview in\r\nfront of the port.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th of May, we arrived at our destination. The\r\nappearance of the city at sunrise was pleasing in the highest degree.\r\nIt is built on a low tract of land, having only one small rocky\r\nelevation at its southern extremity; it, therefore, affords no\r\namphitheatral view from the river; but the white buildings roofed with\r\nred tiles, the numerous towers and cupolas of churches and convents,\r\nthe crowns of palm-trees reared above the buildings, all sharply\r\ndefined against the clear blue sky, give an appearance of lightness and\r\ncheerfulness which is most exhilarating. The perpetual forest hems the\r\ncity in on all sides landwards; and towards the suburbs, picturesque\r\ncountry houses are seen scattered about, half buried in luxuriant\r\nfoliage. The port was full of native canoes and other vessels, large\r\nand small; and the ringing of bells and firing of rockets, announcing\r\nthe dawn of some Roman Catholic festival day, showed that the\r\npopulation was astir at that early hour.\r\n\r\nWe went ashore in due time, and were kindly received by Mr. Miller, the\r\nconsignee of the vessel, who invited us to make his house our home\r\nuntil we could obtain a suitable residence. On landing, the hot moist\r\nmouldy air, which seemed to strike from the ground and walls, reminded\r\nme of the atmosphere of tropical stoves at Kew. In the course of the\r\nafternoon a heavy shower fell, and in the evening, the atmosphere\r\nhaving been cooled by the rain, we walked about a mile out of town to\r\nthe residence of an American gentleman to whom our host wished to\r\nintroduce us.\r\n\r\nThe impressions received during this first walk can never wholly fade\r\nfrom my mind. After traversing the few streets of tall, gloomy,\r\nconvent-looking buildings near the port, inhabited chiefly by merchants\r\nand shopkeepers, along which idle soldiers, dressed in shabby uniforms\r\ncarrying their muskets carelessly over their arms, priests, negresses\r\nwith red water-jars on their heads, sad-looking Indian women carrying\r\ntheir naked children astride on their hips, and other samples of the\r\nmotley life of the place, we passed down a long narrow street leading\r\nto the suburbs. Beyond this, our road lay across a grassy common into a\r\npicturesque lane leading to the virgin forest. The long street was\r\ninhabited by the poorer class of the population. The houses were of one\r\nstory only, and had an irregular and mean appearance. The windows were\r\nwithout glass, having, instead, projecting lattice casements. The\r\nstreet was unpaved, and inches deep in loose sand. Groups of people\r\nwere cooling themselves outside their doors—people of all shades in\r\ncolour of skin, European, Negro and Indian, but chiefly an uncertain\r\nmixture of the three. Amongst them were several handsome women dressed\r\nin a slovenly manner, barefoot or shod in loose slippers, but wearing\r\nrichly-decorated earrings, and around their necks strings of very large\r\ngold beads. They had dark expressive eyes, and remarkably rich heads of\r\nhair. It was a mere fancy, but I thought the mingled squalor,\r\nluxuriance and beauty of these women were pointedly in harmony with the\r\nrest of the scene—so striking, in the view, was the mixture of natural\r\nriches and human poverty. The houses were mostly in a dilapidated\r\ncondition, and signs of indolence and neglect were visible everywhere.\r\nThe wooden palings which surrounded the weed-grown gardens were strewn\r\nabout and broken; hogs, goats, and ill-fed poultry wandered in and out\r\nthrough the gaps. But amidst all, and compensating every defect, rose\r\nthe overpowering beauty of the vegetation. The massive dark crowns of\r\nshady mangos were seen everywhere amongst the dwellings, amidst\r\nfragrant blossoming orange, lemon, and many other tropical fruit trees,\r\nsome in flower, others in fruit, at varying stages of ripeness. Here\r\nand there, shooting above the more dome-like and sombre trees, were the\r\nsmooth columnar stems of palms, bearing aloft their magnificent crowns\r\nof finely-cut fronds. Amongst the latter the slim assai-palm was\r\nespecially noticeable, growing in groups of four or five; its smooth,\r\ngently-curving stem, twenty to thirty feet high, terminating in a head\r\nof feathery foliage, inexpressibly light and elegant in outline. On the\r\nboughs of the taller and more ordinary-looking trees sat tufts of\r\ncuriously- leaved parasites. Slender, woody lianas hung in festoons\r\nfrom the branches, or were suspended in the form of cords and ribbons;\r\nwhilst luxuriant creeping plants overran alike tree-trunks, roofs and\r\nwalls, or toppled over palings in a copious profusion of foliage. The\r\nsuperb banana (Musa paradisiaca), of which I had always read as forming\r\none of the charms of tropical vegetation, grew here with great\r\nluxuriance—its glossy velvety-green leaves, twelve feet in length,\r\ncurving over the roofs of verandahs in the rear of every house. The\r\nshape of the leaves, the varying shades of green which they present\r\nwhen lightly moved by the wind, and especially the contrast they afford\r\nin colour and form to the more sombre hues and more rounded outline of\r\nthe other trees, are quite sufficient to account for the charm of this\r\nglorious tree. Strange forms of vegetation drew our attention at almost\r\nevery step. Amongst them were the different kinds of Bromelia, or\r\npine-apple plants, with their long, rigid, sword-shaped leaves, in some\r\nspecies jagged or toothed along their edges. Then there was the\r\nbread-fruit tree—an importation, it is true; but remarkable from its\r\nlarge, glossy, dark green, strongly digitated foliage, and its\r\ninteresting history. Many other trees and plants, curious in leaf,\r\nstem, or manner of growth, grew on the borders of the thickets along\r\nwhich lay our road; they were all attractive to newcomers, whose last\r\ncountry ramble of quite recent date was over the bleak moors of\r\nDerbyshire on a sleety morning in April.\r\n\r\nAs we continued our walk the brief twilight commenced, and the sounds\r\nof multifarious life came from the vegetation around. The whirring of\r\ncicadas; the shrill stridulation of a vast number and variety of field\r\ncrickets and grasshoppers, each species sounding its peculiar note; the\r\nplaintive hooting of tree frogs—all blended together in one continuous\r\nringing sound—the audible expression of the teeming profusion of\r\nNature. As night came on, many species of frogs and toads in the marshy\r\nplaces joined in the chorus—their croaking and drumming, far louder\r\nthan anything I had before heard in the same line, being added to the\r\nother noises, created an almost deafening din. This uproar of life, I\r\nafterwards found, never wholly ceased, night or day. In the course of\r\ntime I became, like other residents, accustomed to it. It is, however,\r\none of the peculiarities of a tropical—at least, a Brazilian—climate\r\nwhich is most likely to surprise a stranger. After my return to\r\nEngland, the deathlike stillness of summer days in the country appeared\r\nto me as strange as the ringing uproar did on my first arrival at Pará.\r\nThe object of our visit being accomplished, we returned to the city.\r\nThe fire-flies were then out in great numbers, flitting about the\r\nsombre woods, and even the frequented streets. We turned into our\r\nhammocks, well pleased with what we had seen, and full of anticipation\r\nwith regard to the wealth of natural objects we had come to explore.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days, we were employed in landing our baggage and\r\narranging our extensive apparatus. We then accepted the invitation of\r\nMr. Miller to make use of his rocinha, or country-house in the suburbs,\r\nuntil we finally decided on a residence. Upon this, we made our first\r\nessay in housekeeping. We bought cotton hammocks, the universal\r\nsubstitute for beds in this country, cooking utensils and crockery, and\r\nengaged a free negro, named Isidoro, as cook and servant-of-all-work.\r\nOur first walks were in the immediate suburbs of Pará. The city lies on\r\na corner of land formed by the junction of the river Guam&a with the\r\nPará. As I have said before, the forest, which covers the whole\r\ncountry, extends close up to the city streets; indeed, the town is\r\nbuilt on a tract of cleared land, and is kept free from the jungle only\r\nby the constant care of the Government. The surface, though everywhere\r\nlow, is slightly undulating, so that areas of dry land alternate\r\nthroughout with areas of swampy ground, the vegetation and animal\r\ntenants of the two being widely different. Our residence lay on the\r\nside of the city nearest the Guamá, on the borders of one of the low\r\nand swampy areas which here extends over a portion of the suburbs. The\r\ntract of land is intersected by well-macadamised suburban roads, the\r\nchief of which, the Estrada das Mongubeiras (the Monguba road), about a\r\nmile long, is a magnificent avenue of silk-cotton trees (Bombax monguba\r\nand B. ceiba), huge trees whose trunks taper rapidly from the ground\r\nupwards, and whose flowers before opening look like red balls studding\r\nthe branches. This fine road was constructed under the governorship of\r\nthe Count dos Arcos, about the year 1812. At right angles to it run a\r\nnumber of narrow green lanes, and the whole district is drained by a\r\nsystem of small canals or trenches through which the tide ebbs and\r\nflows, showing the lowness of the site. Before I left the country,\r\nother enterprising presidents had formed a number of avenues lined with\r\ncocoa-nut palms, almond and other trees, in continuation of the Monguba\r\nroad, over the more elevated and drier ground to the north-east of the\r\ncity. On the high ground the vegetation has an aspect quite different\r\nfrom that which it presents in the swampy parts. Indeed, with the\r\nexception of the palm-trees, the suburbs here have an aspect like that\r\nof a village green at home. The soil is sandy, and the open commons are\r\ncovered with a short grassy and shrubby vegetation. Beyond this, the\r\nland again descends to a marshy tract, where, at the bottom of the\r\nmoist hollows, the public wells are situated. Here all the linen of the\r\ncity is washed by hosts of noisy negresses, and here also the\r\nwater-carts are filled—painted hogsheads on wheels, drawn by bullocks.\r\nIn early morning, when the sun sometimes shines through a light mist,\r\nand everything is dripping with moisture, this part of the city is full\r\nof life; vociferous negroes and wrangling Gallegos,[1] the proprietors\r\nof the water-carts, are gathered about, jabbering continually, and\r\ntaking their morning drams in dirty wine-shops at the street corners.\r\n\r\n [1] Natives of Galicia, in Spain, who follow this occupation in Lisbon\r\n and Oporto, as well as at Pará.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong these beautiful roads we found much to interest us during the\r\nfirst few days. Suburbs of towns, and open, sunny cultivated places in\r\nBrazil, are tenanted by species of animals and plants which are mostly\r\ndifferent from those of the dense primaeval forests. I will, therefore,\r\ngive an account of what we observed of the animal world during our\r\nexplorations in the immediate neighbourhood of Pará.\r\n\r\nThe number and beauty of the birds and insects did not at first equal\r\nour expectations. The majority of the birds we saw were small and\r\nobscurely coloured; they were indeed similar, in general appearance, to\r\nsuch as are met with in country places in England. Occasionally a flock\r\nof small parroquets, green, with a patch of yellow on the forehead,\r\nwould come at early morning to the trees near the Estrada. They would\r\nfeed quietly, sometimes chattering in subdued tones, but setting up a\r\nharsh scream, and flying off, on being disturbed. Humming-birds we did\r\nnot see at this time, although I afterwards found them by hundreds when\r\ncertain trees were in flower. Vultures we only saw at a distance,\r\nsweeping round at a great height, over the public slaughter-houses.\r\nSeveral flycatchers, finches, ant-thrushes, a tribe of plainly-coloured\r\nbirds, intermediate in structure between flycatchers and thrushes, some\r\nof which startle the new-comer by their extraordinary notes emitted\r\nfrom their places of concealment in the dense thickets; and also\r\ntanagers, and other small birds, inhabited the neighbourhood. None of\r\nthese had a pleasing song, except a little brown wren (Troglodytes\r\nfurvus), whose voice and melody resemble those of our English robin. It\r\nis often seen hopping and climbing about the walls and roofs of houses\r\nand on trees in their vicinity. Its song is more frequently heard in\r\nthe rainy season, when the Monguba trees shed their leaves. At those\r\ntimes the Estrada das Mongubeiras has an appearance quite unusual in a\r\ntropical country. The tree is one of the few in the Amazon region which\r\nsheds all its foliage before any of the new leaf-buds expand. The naked\r\nbranches, the sodden ground matted with dead leaves, the grey mist\r\nveiling the surrounding vegetation, and the cool atmosphere soon after\r\nsunrise, all combine to remind one of autumnal mornings in England.\r\nWhilst loitering about at such times in a half-oblivious mood, thinking\r\nof home, the song of this bird would create for the moment a perfect\r\nillusion. Numbers of tanagers frequented the fruit and other trees in\r\nour garden. The two principal kinds which attracted our attention were\r\nthe Rhamphocoelus Jacapa and the Tanagra Episcopus. The females of both\r\nare dull in colour, but the male of Jacapa has a beautiful velvety\r\npurple and black plumage, the beak being partly white, whilst the same\r\nsex in Episcopus is of a pale blue colour, with white spots on the\r\nwings. In their habits they both resemble the common house- sparrow of\r\nEurope, which does not exist in South America, its place being in some\r\nmeasure filled by these familiar tanagers. They are just as lively,\r\nrestless, bold, and wary; their notes are very similar, chirping and\r\ninharmonious, and they seem to be almost as fond of the neighbourhood\r\nof man. They do not, however, build their nests on houses.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and common bird was the Japim, a species of\r\nCassicus (C. icteronotus). It belongs to the same family of birds as\r\nour starling, magpie, and rook—it has a rich yellow and black plumage,\r\nremarkably compact and velvety in texture. The shape of its head and\r\nits physiognomy are very similar to those of the magpie; it has light\r\ngrey eyes, which give it the same knowing expression. It is social in\r\nits habits, and builds its nest, like the English rook, on trees in the\r\nneighbourhood of habitations. But the nests are quite differently\r\nconstructed, being shaped like purses, two feet in length, and\r\nsuspended from the slender branches all around the tree, some of them\r\nvery near the ground. The entrance is on the side near the bottom of\r\nthe nest. The bird is a great favourite with the Brazilians of Pará—it\r\nis a noisy, stirring, babbling creature, passing constantly to and fro,\r\nchattering to its comrades, and is very ready at imitating other birds,\r\nespecially the domestic poultry of the vicinity. There was at one time\r\na weekly newspaper published at Pará, called _ The Japim_; the name\r\nbeing chosen, I suppose, on account of the babbling propensities of the\r\nbird. Its eggs are nearly round, and of a bluish-white colour, speckled\r\nwith brown.\r\n\r\nOf other vertebrate animals we saw very little, except of the lizards.\r\nThese are sure to attract the attention of the newcomer from Northern\r\nEurope, by reason of their strange appearance, great numbers, and\r\nvariety. The species which are seen crawling over the walls of\r\nbuildings in the city are different from those found in the forest or\r\nin the interior of houses. They are unpleasant- looking animals, with\r\ncolours assimilated to those of the dilapidated stone and mud walls on\r\nwhich they are seen. The house lizards belong to a peculiar family, the\r\nGeckos, and are found even in the best-kept chambers, most frequently\r\non the walls and ceilings, to which they cling motionless by day, being\r\nactive only at night. They are of speckled grey or ashy colours. The\r\nstructure of their feet is beautifully adapted for clinging to and\r\nrunning over smooth surfaces; the underside of their toes being\r\nexpanded into cushions, beneath which folds of skin form a series of\r\nflexible plates. By means of this apparatus they can walk or run across\r\na smooth ceiling with their backs downwards; the plated soles, by quick\r\nmuscular action, exhausting and admitting air alternately. The Geckos\r\nare very repulsive in appearance. The Brazilians give them the name of\r\nOsgas, and firmly believe them to be poisonous; they are, however,\r\nharmless creatures. Those found in houses are small; but I have seen\r\nothers of great size, in crevices of tree trunks in the forest.\r\nSometimes Geckos are found with forked tails; this results from the\r\nbudding of a rudimentary tail at the side, from an injury done to the\r\nmember. A slight rap will cause their tails to snap off; the loss being\r\nafterwards partially repaired by a new growth. The tails of lizards\r\nseem to be almost useless appendages to these animals. I used often to\r\namuse myself in the suburbs, whilst resting in the verandah of our\r\nhouse during the heat of mid-day, by watching the variegated green,\r\nbrown, and yellow ground-lizards. They would come nimbly forward, and\r\ncommence grubbing with their forefeet and snouts around the roots of\r\nherbage, searching for insect larvae. On the slightest alarm, they\r\nwould scamper off, their tails cocked up in the air as they waddled\r\nawkwardly away, evidently an incumbrance to them in their flight.\r\n\r\nNext to the birds and lizards, the insects of the suburbs of Pará\r\ndeserve a few remarks. The species observed in the weedy and open\r\nplaces, as already remarked, were generally different from those which\r\ndwell in the shades of the forest. In the gardens, numbers of fine\r\nshowy butterflies were seen. There were two swallow-tailed species,\r\nsimilar in colours to the English Papilio Machaon; a white Pieris (P.\r\nMonuste), and two or three species of brimstone and orange coloured\r\nbutterflies, which do not belong, however, to the same genus as our\r\nEnglish species. In weedy places a beautiful butterfly, with eye-like\r\nspots on its wings was common, the Junonia Lavinia, the only Amazonian\r\nspecies which is at all nearly related to our Vanessas, the Admiral and\r\nPeacock Butterflies. One day, we made our first acquaintance with two\r\nof the most beautiful productions of nature in this department—namely,\r\nthe Helicopis Cupido and Endymion. A little beyond our house, one of\r\nthe narrow green lanes which I have already mentioned diverged from the\r\nMonguba avenue, and led, between enclosures overrun with a profusion of\r\ncreeping plants and glorious flowers, down to a moist hollow, where\r\nthere was a public well in a picturesque nook, buried in a grove of\r\nMucajá palm-trees. On the tree trunks, walls, and palings, grew a great\r\nquantity of climbing Pothos plants, with large glossy heart-shaped\r\nleaves. These plants were the resort of these two exquisite species,\r\nand we captured a great number of specimens. They are of extremely\r\ndelicate texture. The wings are cream-coloured, the hind pair have\r\nseveral tail-like appendages, and are spangled beneath as if with\r\nsilver. Their flight is very slow and feeble; they seek the protected\r\nunder-surface of the leaves, and in repose close their wings over the\r\nback, so as to expose the brilliantly spotted under-surface.\r\n\r\nI will pass over the many other orders and families of insects, and\r\nproceed at once to the ants. These were in great numbers everywhere,\r\nbut I will mention here only two kinds. We were amazed at seeing ants\r\nan inch and a quarter in length, and stout in proportion, marching in\r\nsingle file through the thickets. These belonged to the species called\r\nDinoponera grandis. Its colonies consist of a small number of\r\nindividuals, and are established about the roots of slender trees. It\r\nis a stinging species, but the sting is not so severe as in many of the\r\nsmaller kinds. There was nothing peculiar or attractive in the habits\r\nof this giant amongst the ants. Another far more interesting species\r\nwas the Saüba (Œcodoma cephalotes). This ant is seen everywhere about\r\nthe suburbs, marching to and fro in broad columns. From its habit of\r\ndespoiling the most valuable cultivated trees of their foliage, it is a\r\ngreat scourge to the Brazilians. In some districts it is so abundant\r\nthat agriculture is almost impossible, and everywhere complaints are\r\nheard of the terrible pest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaüba or Leaf-carrying ant.—1. Worker-minor; 2. Worker-major; 3.\r\nSubterranean worker.\r\n\r\nThe workers of this species are of three orders, and vary in size from\r\ntwo to seven lines; some idea of them may be obtained from the\r\naccompanying woodcut. The true working-class of a colony is formed by\r\nthe small-sized order of workers, the worker-minors as they are called\r\n(Fig. 1). The two other kinds, whose functions, as we shall see, are\r\nnot yet properly understood, have enormously swollen and massive heads;\r\nin one (Fig. 2), the head is highly polished; in the other (Fig. 3), it\r\nis opaque and hairy. The worker-minors vary greatly in size, some being\r\ndouble the bulk of others. The entire body is of very solid\r\nconsistency, and of a pale reddish-brown colour. The thorax or middle\r\nsegment is armed with three pairs of sharp spines; the head, also, has\r\na pair of similar spines proceeding from the cheeks behind.\r\n\r\nIn our first walks we were puzzled to account for large mounds of\r\nearth, of a different colour from the surrounding soil, which were\r\nthrown up in the plantations and woods. Some of them were very\r\nextensive, being forty yards in circumference, but not more than two\r\nfeet in height. We soon ascertained that these were the work of the\r\nSaübas, being the outworks, or domes, which overlie and protect the\r\nentrances to their vast subterranean galleries. On close examination, I\r\nfound the earth of which they are composed to consist of very minute\r\ngranules, agglomerated without cement, and forming many rows of little\r\nridges and turrets. The difference in colour from the superficial soil\r\nof the vicinity is owing to their being formed of the undersoil,\r\nbrought up from a considerable depth. It is very rarely that the ants\r\nare seen at work on these mounds; the entrances seem to be generally\r\nclosed; only now and then, when some particular work is going on, are\r\nthe galleries opened. The entrances are small and numerous; in the\r\nlarger hillocks it would require a great amount of excavation to get at\r\nthe main galleries; but, I succeeded in removing portions of the dome\r\nin smaller hillocks, and then I found that the minor entrances\r\nconverged, at the depth of about two feet, into one broad,\r\nelaborately-worked gallery or mine, which was four or five inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThis habit of the Saüba ant, of clipping and carrying away immense\r\nquantities of leaves, has long been recorded in books on natural\r\nhistory. When employed on this work, their processions look like a\r\nmultitude of animated leaves on the march. In some places I found an\r\naccumulation of such leaves, all circular pieces, about the size of a\r\nsixpence, lying on the pathway, unattended by ants, and at some\r\ndistance from any colony. Such heaps are always found to be removed\r\nwhen the place is revisited the next day. In course of time I had\r\nplenty of opportunities of seeing them at work. They mount the tree in\r\nmultitudes, the individuals being all worker-minors. Each one places\r\nitself on the surface of a leaf, and cuts, with its sharp scissor-like\r\njaws, a nearly semicircular incision on the upper side; it then takes\r\nthe edge between its jaws, and by a sharp jerk detaches the piece.\r\nSometimes they let the leaf drop to the ground, where a little heap\r\naccumulates, until carried off by another relay of workers; but,\r\ngenerally, each marches off with the piece it has operated upon, and as\r\nall take the same road to their colony, the path they follow becomes in\r\na short time smooth and bare, looking like the impression of a\r\ncartwheel through the herbage.\r\n\r\nIt is a most interesting sight to see the vast host of busy diminutive\r\nlabourers occupied on this work. Unfortunately, they choose cultivated\r\ntrees for their purpose. This ant is quite peculiar to Tropical\r\nAmerica, as is the entire genus to which it belongs; it sometimes\r\ndespoils the young trees of species growing wild in its native forests,\r\nbut seems to prefer, when within reach, plants imported from other\r\ncountries, such as the coffee and orange trees. It has not hitherto\r\nbeen shown satisfactorily to what use it applies the leaves. I\r\ndiscovered this only after much time spent in investigation. The leaves\r\nare used to thatch the domes which cover the entrances to their\r\nsubterranean dwellings, thereby protecting from the deluging rains the\r\nyoung broods in the nests beneath. The larger mounds, already\r\ndescribed, are so extensive that few persons would attempt to remove\r\nthem for the purpose of examining their interior; but smaller hillocks,\r\ncovering other entrances to the same system of tunnels and chambers,\r\nmay be found in sheltered places, and these are always thatched with\r\nleaves, mingled with granules of earth. The heavily- laden workers,\r\neach carrying its segment of leaf vertically, the lower edge secured in\r\nits mandibles, troop up and cast their burdens on the hillock; another\r\nrelay of labourers place the leaves in position, covering them with a\r\nlayer of earthy granules, which are brought one by one from the soil\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nThe underground abodes of this wonderful ant are known to be very\r\nextensive. The Rev. Hamlet Clark has related that the Saüba of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, a species closely allied to ours, has excavated a tunnel under\r\nthe bed of the river Paráhyba, at a place where it is broad as the\r\nThames at London Bridge. At the Magoary Rice Mills, near Pará, these\r\nants once pierced the embankment of a large reservoir; the great body\r\nof water which it contained escaped before the damage could be\r\nrepaired. In the Botanic Gardens, at Pará, an enterprising French\r\ngardener tried all he could think of to extirpate the Saüba. With this\r\nobject, he made fires over some of the main entrances to their\r\ncolonies, and blew the fumes of sulphur down the galleries by means of\r\nbellows. I saw the smoke issue from a great number of outlets, one of\r\nwhich was seventy yards distant from the place where the bellows were\r\nused. This shows how extensively the underground galleries are\r\nramified.\r\n\r\nBesides injuring and destroying young trees by despoiling them of their\r\nfoliage, the Saüba ant is troublesome to the inhabitants from its habit\r\nof plundering the stores of provisions in houses at night, for it is\r\neven more active by night than in the day-time. At first I was inclined\r\nto discredit the stories of their entering habitations and carrying off\r\ngrain by grain the farinha or mandioca meal, the bread of the poorer\r\nclasses of Brazil. At length, whilst residing at an Indian village on\r\nthe Tapajos, I had ample proof of the fact. One night my servant woke\r\nme three or four hours before sunrise, by calling out that the rats\r\nwere robbing the farinha baskets—the article at that time being scarce\r\nand dear. I got up, listened, and found the noise was very unlike that\r\nmade by rats. So, I took the light and went into the store- room, which\r\nwas close to my sleeping-place. I there found a broad column of Sauba\r\nants, consisting of thousands of individuals, as busy as possible,\r\npassing to and fro between the door and my precious baskets. Most of\r\nthose passing outwards were laden each with a grain of farinha, which\r\nwas, in some cases, larger and many times heavier than the bodies of\r\nthe carriers. Farinha consists of grains of similar size and appearance\r\nto the tapioca of our shops; both are products of the same root,\r\ntapioca being the pure starch, and farinha the starch mixed with woody\r\nfibre, the latter ingredient giving it a yellowish colour. It was\r\namusing to see some of the dwarfs, the smallest members of their\r\nfamily, staggering along, completely hidden under their load. The\r\nbaskets, which were on a high table, were entirely covered with ants,\r\nmany hundreds of whom were employed in snipping the dry leaves which\r\nserved as lining. This produced the rustling sound which had at first\r\ndisturbed us. My servant told me that they would carry off the whole\r\ncontents of the two baskets (about two bushels) in the course of the\r\nnight, if they were not driven off; so we tried to exterminate them by\r\nkilling them with our wooden clogs. It was impossible, however, to\r\nprevent fresh hosts coming in as fast as we killed their companions.\r\nThey returned the next night; and I was then obliged to lay trains of\r\ngunpowder along their line, and blow them up. This, repeated many\r\ntimes, at last seemed to intimidate them, for we were free from their\r\nvisits during the remainder of my residence at the place. What they did\r\nwith the hard dry grains of mandioca I was never able to ascertain, and\r\ncannot even conjecture. The meal contains no gluten, and therefore\r\nwould be useless as cement. It contains only a small relative portion\r\nof starch, and, when mixed with water, it separates and falls away like\r\nso much earthy matter. It may serve as food for the subterranean\r\nworkers. But the young or larvae of ants are usually fed by juices\r\nsecreted by the worker nurses.\r\n\r\nAnts, it is scarcely necessary to observe, consist, in each species, of\r\nthree sets of individuals, or, as some express it, of three\r\nsexes—namely, males, females, and workers; the last- mentioned being\r\nundeveloped females. The perfect sexes are winged on their first\r\nattaining the adult state; they alone propagate their kind, flying\r\naway, previous to the act of reproduction, from the nest in which they\r\nhave been reared. This winged state of the perfect males and females,\r\nand the habit of flying abroad before pairing, are very important\r\npoints in the economy of ants; for they are thus enabled to intercross\r\nwith members of distant colonies which swarm at the same time, and\r\nthereby increase the vigour of the race, a proceeding essential to the\r\nprosperity of any species. In many ants, especially those of tropical\r\nclimates, the workers, again, are of two classes, whose structure and\r\nfunctions are widely different. In some species they are wonderfully\r\nunlike each other, and constitute two well-defined forms of workers. In\r\nothers, there is a gradation of individuals between the two extremes.\r\nThe curious differences in structure and habits between these two\r\nclasses form an interesting, but very difficult, study. It is one of\r\nthe great peculiarities of the Saüba ant to possess _three_ classes of\r\nworkers. My investigations regarding them were far from complete; I\r\nwill relate, however, what I have observed on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in leaf-cutting, plundering farinha, and other operations,\r\ntwo classes of workers are always seen (Figs. 1 and 2). They are not,\r\nit is true, very sharply defined in structure, for individuals of\r\nintermediate grades occur. All the work, however, is done by the\r\nindividuals which have small heads (Fig. 1), whilst those which have\r\nenormously large heads, the worker-majors (Fig. 2), are observed to be\r\nsimply walking about. I could never satisfy myself as to the function\r\nof these worker-majors. They are not the soldiers or defenders of the\r\nworking portion of the community, like the armed class in the termites,\r\nor white ants, for they never fight. The species has no sting, and does\r\nnot display active resistance when interfered with. I once imagined\r\nthey exercised a sort of superintendence over the others; but this\r\nfunction is entirely unnecessary in a community where all work with a\r\nprecision and regularity resembling the subordinate parts of a piece of\r\nmachinery. I came to the conclusion, at last, that they have no very\r\nprecisely defined function. They cannot, however, be entirely useless\r\nto the community, for the sustenance of an idle class of such bulky\r\nindividuals would be too heavy a charge for the species to sustain. I\r\nthink they serve, in some sort, as passive instruments of protection to\r\nthe real workers. Their enormously large, hard, and indestructible\r\nheads may be of use in protecting them against the attacks of\r\ninsectivorous animals. They would be, on this view, a kind of “pieces\r\nde resistance,” serving as a foil against onslaughts made on the main\r\nbody of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSauba Ant.—Female.\r\n\r\nThe third order of workers is the most curious of all. If the top of a\r\nsmall, fresh hillock, one in which the thatching process is going on,\r\nis taken off, a broad cylindrical shaft is disclosed at a depth of\r\nabout two feet from the surface. If this is probed with a stick, which\r\nmay be done to the extent of three or four feet without touching\r\nbottom, a small number of colossal fellows (Fig. 3) will slowly begin\r\nto make their way up the smooth sides of the mine. Their heads are of\r\nthe same size as those of the class Fig. 2, but the front is clothed\r\nwith hairs, instead of being polished, and they have in the middle of\r\nthe forehead a twin, ocellus, or simple eye, of quite different\r\nstructure from the ordinary compound eyes, on the sides of the head.\r\nThis frontal eye is totally wanting in the other workers, and is not\r\nknown in any other kind of ant. The apparition of these strange\r\ncreatures from the cavernous depths of the mine reminded me, when I\r\nfirst observed them, of the Cyclopes of Homeric fable. They were not\r\nvery pugnacious, as I feared they would be, and I had no difficulty in\r\nsecuring a few with my fingers. I never saw them under any other\r\ncircumstances than those here related, and what their special functions\r\nmay be I cannot divine.\r\n\r\nThe whole arrangement of a Formicarium, or ant-colony, and all the\r\nvaried activity of ant-life, are directed to one main purpose—the\r\nperpetuation and dissemination of the species. Most of the labour which\r\nwe see performed by the workers has for its end the sustenance and\r\nwelfare of the young brood, which are helpless grubs. The true females\r\nare incapable of attending to the wants of their offspring; and it is\r\non the poor sterile workers, who are denied all the other pleasures of\r\nmaternity, that the entire care devolves. The workers are also the\r\nchief agents in carrying out the different migrations of the colonies,\r\nwhich are of vast importance to the dispersal and consequent prosperity\r\nof the species. The successful _dé_ but of the winged males and females\r\ndepends likewise on the workers. It is amusing to see the activity and\r\nexcitement which reigns in an ant’s nest when the exodus of the winged\r\nindividuals is taking place. The workers clear the roads of exit, and\r\nshow the most lively interest in their departure, although it is highly\r\nimprobable that any of them will return to the same colony. The\r\nswarming or exodus of the winged males and females of the Saüba ant\r\ntakes place in January and February, that is, at the commencement of\r\nthe rainy season. They come out in the evening in vast numbers, causing\r\nquite a commotion in the streets and lanes. They are of very large\r\nsize, the female measuring no less than two-and-a-quarter inches in\r\nexpanse of wing; the male is not much more than half this size. They\r\nare so eagerly preyed upon by insectivorous animals that on the morning\r\nafter their flight not an individual is to be seen, a few impregnated\r\nfemales alone escaping the slaughter to found new colonies.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our arrival, Pará had not quite recovered from the\r\neffects of a series of revolutions, brought about by the hatred which\r\nexisted between the native Brazilians and the Portuguese; the former,\r\nin the end, calling to their aid the Indian and mixed coloured\r\npopulation. The number of inhabitants of the city had decreased, in\r\nconsequence of these disorders, from 24,500 in 1819, to 15,000 in 1848.\r\nAlthough the public peace had not been broken for twelve years before\r\nthe date of our visit, confidence was not yet completely restored, and\r\nthe Portuguese merchants and tradesmen would not trust themselves to\r\nlive at their beautiful country-houses or rocinhas, which lie embosomed\r\nin the luxuriant shady gardens around the city. No progress had been\r\nmade in clearing the second-growth forest which had grown over the once\r\ncultivated grounds, and now reached the end of all the suburban\r\nstreets. The place had the aspect of one which had seen better days;\r\nthe public buildings, including the palaces of the President and\r\nBishop, the cathedral, the principal churches and convents, all seemed\r\nconstructed on a scale of grandeur far beyond the present requirements\r\nof the city. Streets full of extensive private residences, built in the\r\nItalian style of architecture, were in a neglected condition, weeds and\r\nflourishing young trees growing from large cracks in the masonry. The\r\nlarge public squares were overgrown with weeds and impassable, on\r\naccount of the swampy places which occupied portions of their areas.\r\nCommerce, however, was now beginning to revive, and before I left the\r\ncountry I saw great improvements, as I shall have to relate towards the\r\nconclusion of this narrative.\r\n\r\nThe province of which Pará is the capital, was at the time I allude to,\r\nthe most extensive in the Brazilian empire, being about 1560 miles in\r\nlength from east to west, and about 600 in breadth. Since that\r\ndate—namely in 1853—it has been divided into two by the separation of\r\nthe Upper Amazons as a distinct province. It formerly constituted a\r\nsection, capitania, or governorship of the Portuguese colony.\r\nOriginally it was well peopled by Indians, varying much in social\r\ncondition according to their tribe, but all exhibiting the same general\r\nphysical characters, which are those of the American red man, somewhat\r\nmodified by long residence in an equatorial forest country. Most of the\r\ntribes are now extinct or forgotten, at least those which originally\r\npeopled the banks of the main river, their descendants having\r\namalgamated with the white and negro immigrants:[2] many still exist,\r\nhowever, in their original state on the Upper Amazons and most of the\r\nbranch rivers. On this account, Indians in this province are far more\r\nnumerous than elsewhere in Brazil, and the Indian element may be said\r\nto prevail in the mongrel population—the negro proportion being much\r\nsmaller than in South Brazil.\r\n\r\n [2] The mixed breeds which now form, probably, the greater part of the\r\n population, each have a distinguishing name. Mameluco denotes the\r\n offspring of White with Indian; Mulatto, that of White with Negro;\r\n Cafuzo, the mixture of the Indian and Negro; Curiboco, the cross\r\n between the Cafuzo and the Indian; Xibaro, that between the Cafuzo and\r\n Negro. These are seldom, however, well-demarcated, and all shades of\r\n colour exist; the names are generally applied only approximatively.\r\n The term Creole is confined to negroes born in the country. The\r\n civilised Indian is called Tapuyo or Caboclo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city is built on the best available site for a port of entry to the\r\nAmazons region, and must in time become a vast emporium; the northern\r\nshore of the main river, where alone a rival capital could be founded,\r\nis much more difficult of access to vessels, and is besides extremely\r\nunhealthy. Although lying so near the equator (1° 28′ S. lat.) the\r\nclimate is not excessively hot. The temperature during three years only\r\nonce reached 95° Fahrenheit. The greatest heat of the day, about 2\r\np.m., ranges generally between 89° and 94°; but on the other hand, the\r\nair is never cooler than 73°, so that a uniformly high temperature\r\nexists, and the mean of the year is 81°. North American residents say\r\nthat the heat is not so oppressive as it is in summer in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. The humidity is, of course, excessive, but the rains are\r\nnot so heavy and continuous in the wet season as in many other tropical\r\nclimates. The country had for a long time a reputation for extreme\r\nsalubrity. Since the small-pox in 1819, which attacked chiefly the\r\nIndians, no serious epidemic had visited the province. We were\r\nagreeably surprised to find no danger from exposure to the night air or\r\nresidence in the low swampy lands. A few English residents, who had\r\nbeen established here for twenty or thirty years, looked almost as\r\nfresh in colour as if they had never left their native country. The\r\nnative women, too, seemed to preserve their good looks and plump\r\ncondition until late in life. I nowhere observed that early decay of\r\nappearance in Brazilian ladies, which is said to be so general in the\r\nwomen of North America. Up to 1848 the salubrity of Pará was quite\r\nremarkable for a city lying in the delta of a great river, in the\r\nmiddle of the tropics and half surrounded by swamps. It did not much\r\nlonger enjoy its immunity from epidemics. In 1850 the yellow fever\r\nvisited the province for the first time, and carried off in a few weeks\r\nmore than four per cent of the population. One disease after another\r\nsucceeded, until in 1855 cholera swept through the country and caused\r\nfearful havoc. Since then, the healthfulness of the climate has been\r\ngradually restored, and it is now fast recovering its former good\r\nreputation. Pará is free from serious endemic disorders, and was once a\r\nresort of invalids from New York and Massachusetts. The equable\r\ntemperature, the perpetual verdure, the coolness of the dry season when\r\nthe sun’s heat is tempered by the strong sea- breezes and the\r\nmoderation of the periodical rains, make the climate one of the most\r\nenjoyable on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe province is governed, like all others in the empire, by a\r\nPresident, as chief civil authority. At the time of our arrival he also\r\nheld, exceptionally, the chief military command. This functionary,\r\ntogether with the head of the police administration and the judges, is\r\nnominated by the central Government at Rio Janeiro. The municipal and\r\ninternal affairs are managed by a provincial assembly elected by the\r\npeople. Every villa or borough throughout the province also possesses\r\nits municipal council, and in thinly-populated districts the\r\ninhabitants choose every four years a justice of the peace, who\r\nadjudicates in small disputes between neighbours. A system of popular\r\neducation exists, and every village has its school of first letters,\r\nthe master being paid by the government, the salary amounting to about\r\n£70, or the same sum as the priests receive. Besides common schools, a\r\nwell-endowed classical seminary is maintained at Pará, to which the\r\nsons of most of the planters and traders in the interior are sent to\r\ncomplete their education. The province returns its quota of members\r\nevery four years to the lower and upper houses of the imperial\r\nparliament. Every householder has a vote. Trial by jury has been\r\nestablished, the jurymen being selected from householders, no matter\r\nwhat their race or colour; and I have seen the white merchant, the\r\nnegro husbandman, the mameluco, the mulatto, and the Indian, all\r\nsitting side by side on the same bench. Altogether the constitution of\r\ngovernment in Brazil seems to combine happily the principles of local\r\nself-government and centralisation, and only requires a proper degree\r\nof virtue and intelligence in the people to lead the nation to great\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe province of Pará, or, as we may now say, the two provinces of Pará\r\nand the Amazons, contain an area of 800,000 square miles, the\r\npopulation of which is only about 230,000, or in the ratio of one\r\nperson to four square miles! The country is covered with forests, and\r\nthe soil is fertile in the extreme, even for a tropical country. It is\r\nintersected throughout by broad and deep navigable rivers. It is the\r\npride of the Paráenses to call the Amazons the Mediterranean of South\r\nAmerica. The colossal stream perhaps deserves the name, for not only\r\nhave the main river and its principal tributaries an immense expanse of\r\nwater bathing the shores of extensive and varied regions, but there is\r\nalso throughout a system of back channels, connected with the main\r\nrivers by narrow outlets and linking together a series of lakes, some\r\nof which are fifteen, twenty, and thirty miles in length. The whole\r\nAmazons valley is thus covered by a network of navigable waters,\r\nforming a vast inland freshwater sea with endless ramifications—rather\r\nthan a river.\r\n\r\nThe city of Pará was founded in 1615, and was a place of considerable\r\nimportance towards the latter half of the eighteenth century, under the\r\ngovernment of the brother of Pombal, the famous Portuguese statesman.\r\nThe province was the last in Brazil to declare its independence of the\r\nmother-country and acknowledge the authority of the first emperor, Don\r\nPedro. This was owing to the great numbers and influence of the\r\nPortuguese, and the rage of the native party was so great in\r\nconsequence, that immediately after independence was proclaimed in\r\n1823, a counter revolution broke out, during which many hundred lives\r\nwere lost and much hatred engendered. The antagonism continued for many\r\nyears, partial insurrections taking place when the populace thought\r\nthat the immigrants from Portugal were favoured by the governors sent\r\nfrom the capital of the empire. At length, in 1835, a serious revolt\r\ntook place which in a short time involved the entire province. It began\r\nby the assassination of the President and the leading members of the\r\ngovernment; the struggle was severe, and the native party in an evil\r\nhour called to their aid the ignorant and fanatic part of the mongrel\r\nand Indian population. The cry of death to the Portuguese was soon\r\nchanged to death to the freemasons, then a powerfully organised society\r\nembracing the greater part of the male white inhabitants. The\r\nvictorious native party endeavoured to establish a government of their\r\nown. After this state of things had endured six months, they accepted a\r\nnew President sent from Rio Janeiro, who, however, again irritated them\r\nby imprisoning their favourite leader, Vinagre. The revenge which\r\nfollowed was frightful. A vast host of half- savage coloured people\r\nassembled in the retired creeks behind Pará, and on a day fixed, after\r\nVinagre’s brother had sent a message three times to the President\r\ndemanding, in vain, the release of their leader, the whole body poured\r\ninto the city through the gloomy pathways of the forest which encircles\r\nit. A cruel battle, lasting nine days, was fought in the streets; an\r\nEnglish, French, and Portuguese man-of-war, from the side of the river,\r\nassisting the legal authorities. All the latter, however, together with\r\nevery friend of peace and order, were finally obliged to retire to an\r\nisland a few miles distant. The city and province were given up to\r\nanarchy; the coloured people, elated with victory, proclaimed the\r\nslaughter of all whites, except the English, French, and American\r\nresidents. The mistaken principals who had first aroused all this\r\nhatred of races were obliged now to make their escape. In the interior,\r\nthe supporters of lawful authority including, it must be stated, whole\r\ntribes of friendly Indians and numbers of the better disposed negroes\r\nand mulattos, concentrated themselves in certain strong positions and\r\ndefended themselves, until the reconquest of the capital and large\r\ntowns of the interior in 1836 by a force sent from Rio Janeiro—after\r\nten months of anarchy.\r\n\r\nYears of conciliatory government, the lesson learned by the native\r\nparty and the moderation of the Portuguese, aided by the indolence and\r\npassive goodness of the Paráenses of all classes and colours, were only\r\nbeginning to produce their good effects about the time I am speaking\r\nof. Life, however, was now and had been for some time quite safe\r\nthroughout the country. Some few of the worst characters had been\r\ntransported or imprisoned, and the remainder, after being pardoned,\r\nwere converted once more into quiet and peaceable citizens.\r\n\r\nI resided at Pará nearly a year and a half altogether, returning\r\nthither and making a stay of a few months after each of my shorter\r\nexcursions into the interior, until the 6th of November, 1851, when I\r\nstarted on my long voyage to the Tapajos and the Upper Amazons, which\r\noccupied me seven years and a half. I became during this time tolerably\r\nfamiliar with the capital of the Amazons region, and its inhabitants.\r\nCompared with other Brazilian seaport towns, I was always told, Pará\r\nshone to great advantage. It was cleaner, the suburbs were fresher,\r\nmore rural and much pleasanter on account of their verdure, shade, and\r\nmagnificent vegetation. The people were simpler, more peaceable and\r\nfriendly in their manners and dispositions; and assassinations, which\r\ngive the southern provinces so ill a reputation, were almost unknown.\r\nAt the same time the Pará people were much inferior to Southern\r\nBrazilians in energy and industry. Provisions and house rents being\r\ncheap and the wants of the people few—for they were content with food\r\nand lodging of a quality which would be spurned by paupers in\r\nEngland—they spent the greater part of their time in sensual\r\nindulgences and in amusements which the government and wealthier\r\ncitizens provided for them gratis. The trade, wholesale and retail, was\r\nin the hands of the Portuguese, of whom there were about 2500 in the\r\nplace. Many handicrafts were exercised by coloured people, mulattos,\r\nmamelucos, free negroes, and Indians. The better sort of Brazilians\r\ndislike the petty details of shop-keeping, and if they cannot be\r\nwholesale merchants, prefer the life of planters in the country,\r\nhowever small may be the estate and the gains. The negroes constituted\r\nthe class of field-labourers and porters; Indians were universally the\r\nwatermen, and formed the crews of the numberless canoes of all sizes\r\nand shapes which traded between Pará and the interior. The educated\r\nBrazilians, not many of whom are of pure Caucasian descent—for the\r\nimmigration of Portuguese, for many years, has been almost exclusively\r\nof the male sex—are courteous, lively, and intelligent people. They\r\nwere gradually weaning themselves of the ignorant, bigoted notions\r\nwhich they inherited from their Portuguese ancestors, especially those\r\nentertained with regard to the treatment of women. Formerly, the\r\nPortuguese would not allow their wives to go into society, or their\r\ndaughters to learn reading and writing. In 1848, Brazilian ladies were\r\nonly just beginning to emerge from this inferior position, and\r\nBrazilian fathers were opening their eyes to the advantages of\r\neducation for their daughters. Reforms of this kind are slow. It is,\r\nperhaps, in part owing to the degrading position always held by women,\r\nthat the relations between the sexes were, and are still, on so\r\nunsatisfactory a footing, and private morality at so low an ebb, in\r\nBrazil. In Pará, I believe that an improvement is now taking place, but\r\nformerly promiscuous intercourse seemed to be the general rule amongst\r\nall classes, and intrigues and love-making the serious business of the\r\ngreater part of the population. That this state of things is a\r\nnecessity depending on the climate and institutions I do not believe,\r\nas I have resided at small towns in the interior, where the habits, and\r\nthe general standard of morality of the inhabitants, were as pure as\r\nthey are in similar places in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nPARÁ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swampy Forests of Pará — A Portuguese Landed Proprietor — Country\r\nHouse at Nazareth — Life of a Naturalist under the Equator — The drier\r\nVirgin Forests —Magoary — Retired Creeks — Aborigines.\r\n\r\nAfter having resided about a fortnight at Mr. Miller’s rocinha, we\r\nheard of another similar country-house to be let, much better situated\r\nfor our purpose, in the village of Nazareth, a mile and a half from the\r\ncity and close to the forest. The owner was an old Portuguese gentleman\r\nnamed Danin, who lived at his tile manufactory at the mouth of the Una,\r\na small river lying two miles below Pará. We resolved to walk to his\r\nplace through the forest, a distance of three miles, although the road\r\nwas said to be scarcely passable at this season of the year, and the\r\nUna much more easily accessible by boat. We were glad, however, of this\r\nearly opportunity of traversing the rich swampy forest which we had\r\nadmired so much from the deck of the ship; so, about eleven o’clock one\r\nsunny morning, after procuring the necessary information about the\r\nroad, we set off in that direction. This part of the forest afterwards\r\nbecame one of my best hunting-grounds. I will narrate the incidents of\r\nthe walk, giving my first impressions and some remarks on the wonderful\r\nvegetation. The forest is very similar on most of the low lands, and\r\ntherefore, one description will do for all.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the town we walked along a straight, suburban road\r\nconstructed above the level of the surrounding land. It had low swampy\r\nground on each side, built upon, however, and containing several\r\nspacious rocinhas which were embowered in magnificent foliage. Leaving\r\nthe last of these, we arrived at a part where the lofty forest towered\r\nup like a wall five or six yards from the edge of the path to the\r\nheight of, probably, a hundred feet. The tree trunks were only seen\r\npartially here and there, nearly the whole frontage from ground to\r\nsummit being covered with a diversified drapery of creeping plants, all\r\nof the most vivid shades of green; scarcely a flower to be seen, except\r\nin some places a solitary scarlet passion-flower set in the green\r\nmantle like a star. The low ground on the borders between the forest\r\nwall and the road was encumbered with a tangled mass of bushy and\r\nshrubby vegetation, amongst which prickly mimosas were very numerous,\r\ncovering the other bushes in the same way as brambles do in England.\r\nOther dwarf mimosas trailed along the ground close to the edge of the\r\nroad, shrinking at the slightest touch of the feet as we passed by.\r\nCassia trees, with their elegant pinnate foliage and conspicuous yellow\r\nflowers, formed a great proportion of the lower trees, and arborescent\r\narums grew in groups around the swampy hollows. Over the whole\r\nfluttered a larger number of brilliantly-coloured butterflies than we\r\nhad yet seen; some wholly orange or yellow (Callidryas), others with\r\nexcessively elongated wings, sailing horizontally through the air,\r\ncoloured black, and varied with blue, red, and yellow (Heliconii). One\r\nmagnificent grassy-green species (Colænis Dido) especially attracted\r\nour attention. Near the ground hovered many other smaller species very\r\nsimilar in appearance to those found at home, attracted by the flowers\r\nof numerous leguminous and other shrubs. Besides butterflies, there\r\nwere few other insects except dragonflies, which were in great numbers,\r\nsimilar in shape to English species, but some of them looking\r\nconspicuously different on account of their fiery red colours.\r\n\r\nAfter stopping repeatedly to examine and admire, we at length walked\r\nonward. The road then ascended slightly, and the soil and vegetation\r\nbecame suddenly altered in character. The shrubs here were grasses, low\r\nsedges and other plants, smaller in foliage than those growing in moist\r\ngrounds. The forest was second growth, low, consisting of trees which\r\nhad the general aspect of laurels and other evergreens in our gardens\r\nat home—the leaves glossy and dark green. Some of them were elegantly\r\nveined and hairy (Melastomæ), whilst many, scattered amongst the rest,\r\nhad smaller foliage (Myrtles), but these were not sufficient to\r\nsubtract much from the general character of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe sun, now, for we had loitered long on the road, was exceedingly\r\npowerful. The day was most brilliant; the sky without a cloud. In fact,\r\nit was one of those glorious days which announce the commencement of\r\nthe dry season. The radiation of heat from the sandy ground was visible\r\nby the quivering motion of the air above it. We saw or heard no mammals\r\nor birds; a few cattle belonging to an estate down a shady lane were\r\ncongregated, panting, under a cluster of wide-spreading trees. The very\r\nsoil was hot to our feet, and we hastened onward to the shade of the\r\nforest which we could see not far ahead. At length, on entering it,\r\nwhat a relief! We found ourselves in a moderately broad pathway or\r\nalley, where the branches of the trees crossed overhead and produced a\r\ndelightful shade. The woods were at first of recent growth, dense, and\r\nutterly impenetrable; the ground, instead of being clothed with grass\r\nand shrubs as in the woods of Europe, was everywhere carpeted with\r\nLycopodiums (fern-shaped mosses). Gradually the scene became changed.\r\nWe descended slightly from an elevated, dry, and sandy area to a low\r\nand swampy one; a cool air breathed on our faces, and a mouldy smell of\r\nrotting vegetation greeted us. The trees were now taller, the underwood\r\nless dense, and we could obtain glimpses into the wilderness on all\r\nsides. The leafy crowns of the trees, scarcely two of which could be\r\nseen together of the same kind, were now far away above us, in another\r\nworld as it were. We could only see at times, where there was a break\r\nabove, the tracery of the foliage against the clear blue sky. Sometimes\r\nthe leaves were palmate, or of the shape of large outstretched hands;\r\nat others, finely cut or feathery, like the leaves of Mimosæ. Below,\r\nthe tree trunks were everywhere linked together by sipós; the woody,\r\nflexible stems of climbing and creeping trees, whose foliage is far\r\naway above, mingled with that of the taller independent trees. Some\r\nwere twisted in strands like cables, others had thick stems contorted\r\nin every variety of shape, entwining snake-like round the tree trunks,\r\nor forming gigantic loops and coils amongst the larger branches;\r\nothers, again, were of zigzag shape, or indented like the steps of a\r\nstaircase, sweeping from the ground to a giddy height.\r\n\r\nIt interested me much afterwards to find that these climbing trees do\r\nnot form any particular family. There is no distinct group of plants\r\nwhose special habit is to climb, but species of many and the most\r\ndiverse families, the bulk of whose members are not climbers, seem to\r\nhave been driven by circumstances to adopt this habit. There is even a\r\nclimbing genus of palms (Desmoncus), the species of which are called,\r\nin the Tupi language, Jacitára. These have slender, thickly-spined, and\r\nflexuous stems, which twine about the taller trees from one to the\r\nother, and grow to an incredible length. The leaves, which have the\r\nordinary pinnate shape characteristic of the family, are emitted from\r\nthe stems at long intervals, instead of being collected into a dense\r\ncrown, and have at their tips a number of long recurved spines. These\r\nstructures are excellent contrivances to enable the trees to secure\r\nthemselves by in climbing, but they are a great nuisance to the\r\ntraveller, for they sometimes hang over the pathway and catch the hat\r\nor clothes, dragging off the one or tearing the other as he passes. The\r\nnumber and variety of climbing trees in the Amazons forests are\r\ninteresting, taken in connection with the fact of the very general\r\ntendency of the animals, also, to become climbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimbing Palm (Desmoncus)\r\n\r\nAll the Amazonian, and in fact all South American, monkeys are\r\nclimbers. There is no group answering to the baboons of the Old World,\r\nwhich live on the ground. The Gallinaceous birds of the country, the\r\nrepresentatives of the fowls and pheasants of Asia and Africa, are all\r\nadapted by the position of the toes to perch on trees, and it is only\r\non trees, at a great height, that they are to be seen. A genus of\r\nPlantigrade Carnivora, allied to the bears (Cercoleptes), found only in\r\nthe Amazonian forests, is entirely arboreal, and has a long flexible\r\ntail like that of certain monkeys. Many other similar instances could\r\nbe enumerated, but I will mention only the Geodephaga, or carnivorous\r\nground beetles, a great proportion of whose genera and species in these\r\nforest regions are, by the structure of their feet, fitted to live\r\nexclusively on the branches and leaves of trees.\r\n\r\nMany of the woody lianas suspended from trees are not climbers, but the\r\nair-roots of epiphytous plants (Aroideæ), which sit on the stronger\r\nboughs of the trees above and hang down straight as plumb-lines. Some\r\nare suspended singly, others in clusters; some reach halfway to the\r\nground and others touch it, striking their rootlets into the earth. The\r\nunderwood in this part of the forest was composed partly of younger\r\ntrees of the same species as their taller neighbours, and partly of\r\npalms of many species, some of them twenty to thirty feet in height,\r\nothers small and delicate, with stems no thicker than a finger. These\r\nlatter (different kinds of Bactris) bore small bunches of fruit, red or\r\nblack, often containing a sweet, grape-like juice.\r\n\r\nFurther on, the ground became more swampy and we had some difficulty in\r\npicking our way. The wild banana (Urania Amazonica) here began to\r\nappear, and, as it grew in masses, imparted a new aspect to the scene.\r\nThe leaves of this beautiful plant are like broad-sword blades, eight\r\nfeet in length and a foot broad; they rise straight upwards,\r\nalternately, from the top of a stem five or six feet high. Numerous\r\nkinds of plants with leaves similar in shape to these but smaller\r\nclothed the ground. Amongst them were species of Marantaceæ, some of\r\nwhich had broad glossy leaves, with long leaf-stalks radiating from\r\njoints in a reed-like stem. The trunks of the trees were clothed with\r\nclimbing ferns, and Pothos plants with large, fleshy, heart-shaped\r\nleaves. Bamboos and other tall grass and reed-like plants arched over\r\nthe pathway. The appearance of this part of the forest was strange in\r\nthe extreme; description can convey no adequate idea of it. The reader\r\nwho has visited Kew may form some notion by conceiving a vegetation\r\nlike that in the great palm-house, spread over a large tract of swampy\r\nground, but he must fancy it mingled with large exogenous trees similar\r\nto our oaks and elms covered with creepers and parasites, and figure to\r\nhimself the ground encumbered with fallen and rotting trunks, branches,\r\nand leaves; the whole illuminated by a glowing vertical sun, and\r\nreeking with moisture.\r\n\r\nAt length we emerged from the forest, on the banks of the Una, near its\r\nmouth. It was here about one hundred yards wide. The residence of\r\nSenhor Danin stood on the opposite shore; a large building, whitewashed\r\nand red-tiled as usual, raised on wooden piles above the humid ground.\r\nThe second story was the part occupied by the family, and along it was\r\nan open verandah, where people, both male and female, were at work.\r\nBelow were several negroes employed carrying clay on their heads. We\r\ncalled out for a boat, and one of them crossed over to fetch us. Senhor\r\nDanin received us with the usual formal politeness of the Portuguese,\r\nhe spoke English very well, and after we had arranged our business, we\r\nremained conversing with him on various subjects connected with the\r\ncountry. Like all employers in this province, he was full of one\r\ntopic—the scarcity of hands. It appeared that he had made great\r\nexertions to introduce white labour, but had failed, after having\r\nbrought numbers of men from Portugal and other countries under\r\nengagement to work for him. They all left him one by one soon after\r\ntheir arrival. The abundance of unoccupied land, the liberty that\r\nexists, a state of things produced by the half-wild canoe-life of the\r\npeople, and the case with which a mere subsistence can be obtained with\r\nmoderate work, tempt even the best-disposed to quit regular labour as\r\nsoon as they can. He complained also of the dearness of slaves, owing\r\nto the prohibition of the African traffic, telling us that formerly a\r\nslave could be bought for 120 dollars, whereas they are now difficult\r\nto procure at 400 dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Danin told us that he had travelled in England and the United\r\nStates, and that he had now two sons completing their education in\r\nthose countries. I afterwards met with many enterprising persons of Mr.\r\nDanin’s order, both Brazilians and Portuguese; their great ambition is\r\nto make a voyage to Europe or North America, and to send their sons to\r\nbe educated there. The land on which his establishment is built, he\r\ntold us, was an artificial embankment on the swamp; the end of the\r\nhouse was built on a projecting point overlooking the river, so that a\r\ngood view was obtained, from the sitting-rooms, of the city and the\r\nshipping. We learned there was formerly a large and flourishing cattle\r\nestate on this spot, with an open grassy space like a park. On Sundays,\r\ngay parties of forty or fifty persons used to come by land and water,\r\nin carriages and gay galliotas, to spend the day with the hospitable\r\nowner. Since the political disorders which I have already mentioned,\r\ndecay had come upon this as on most other large establishments in the\r\ncountry. The cultivated grounds, and the roads leading to them, were\r\nnow entirely overgrown with dense forest. When we were ready to depart,\r\nSenhor Danin lent a canoe and two negroes to take us to the city, where\r\nwe arrived in the evening after a day rich in new experiences.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, we took possession of our new residence. The house\r\nwas a square building, consisting of four equal-sized rooms; the tiled\r\nroof projected all round, so as to form a broad verandah, cool and\r\npleasant to sit and work in. The cultivated ground, which appeared as\r\nif newly cleared from the forest, was planted with fruit trees and\r\nsmall plots of coffee and mandioca. The entrance to the grounds was by\r\nan iron-grille gateway from a grassy square, around which were built\r\nthe few houses and palm-thatched huts which then constituted the\r\nvillage. The most important building was the chapel of our Lady of\r\nNazareth, which stood opposite our place. The saint here enshrined was\r\na great favourite with all orthodox Paráenses, who attributed to her\r\nthe performance of many miracles. The image was to be seen on the\r\naltar, a handsome doll about four feet high, wearing a silver crown and\r\na garment of blue silk, studded with golden stars. In and about the\r\nchapel were the offerings that had been made to her, proofs of the\r\nmiracles which she had performed. There were models of legs, arms,\r\nbreasts, and so forth, which she had cured. But most curious of all was\r\na ship’s boat, deposited here by the crew of a Portuguese vessel which\r\nhad foundered, a year or two before our arrival, in a squall off\r\nCayenne; part of them having been saved in the boat, after invoking the\r\nprotection of the saint here enshrined. The annual festival in honour\r\nof our Lady of Nazareth is the greatest of the Pará holidays; many\r\npersons come to it from the neighbouring city of Maranham, 300 miles\r\ndistant. Once the President ordered the mail steamer to be delayed two\r\ndays at Pará for the convenience of these visitors. The popularity of\r\nthe festival is partly owing to the beautiful weather that prevails\r\nwhen it takes place, namely, in the middle of the fine season, on the\r\nten days preceding the full moon in October or November. Pará is then\r\nseen at its best. The weather is not too dry, for three weeks never\r\nfollow in succession without a shower; so that all the glory of verdure\r\nand flowers can be enjoyed with clear skies. The moonlit nights are\r\nthen especially beautiful, the atmosphere is transparently clear, and\r\nthe light sea-breeze produces an agreeable coolness.\r\n\r\nWe now settled ourselves for a few months’ regular work. We had the\r\nforest on three sides of us; it was the end of the wet season; most\r\nspecies of birds had finished moulting, and every day the insects\r\nincreased in number and variety. Behind the rocinha, after several\r\ndays’ exploration, I found a series of pathways through the woods,\r\nwhich led to the Una road; about half way was the house in which the\r\ncelebrated travellers Spix and Martius resided during their stay at\r\nPará, in 1819. It was now in a neglected condition, and the plantations\r\nwere overgrown with bushes. The paths hereabout were very productive of\r\ninsects, and being entirely under shade, were very pleasant for\r\nstrolling. Close to our doors began the main forest road. It was broad\r\nenough for two horsemen abreast, and branched off in three directions;\r\nthe main line going to the village of Ourem, a distance of fifty miles.\r\nThis road formerly extended to Maranham, but it had been long in disuse\r\nand was now grown up, being scarcely passable between Pará and Ourem.\r\n\r\nOur researches were made in various directions along these paths, and\r\nevery day produced us a number of new and interesting species.\r\nCollecting, preparing our specimens, and making notes, kept us well\r\noccupied. One day was so much like another, that a general description\r\nof the diurnal round of incidents, including the sequence of natural\r\nphenomena, will be sufficient to give an idea of how days pass to\r\nnaturalists under the equator.\r\n\r\nWe used to rise soon after dawn, when Isidoro would go down to the\r\ncity, after supplying us with a cup of coffee, to purchase the fresh\r\nprovisions for the day. The two hours before breakfast were devoted to\r\nornithology. At that early period of the day the sky was invariably\r\ncloudless (the thermometer marking 72° or 73° Fahr.); the heavy dew or\r\nthe previous night’s rain, which lay on the moist foliage, becoming\r\nquickly dissipated by the glowing sun, which rising straight out of the\r\neast, mounted rapidly towards the zenith. All nature was fresh, new\r\nleaf and flower-buds expanding rapidly. Some mornings a single tree\r\nwould appear in flower amidst what was the preceding evening a uniform\r\ngreen mass of forest—a dome of blossom suddenly created as if by magic.\r\nThe birds were all active; from the wild-fruit trees, not far off, we\r\noften heard the shrill yelping of the Toucans (Ramphastos vitellinus).\r\nSmall flocks of parrots flew over on most mornings, at a great height,\r\nappearing in distinct relief against the blue sky, always two-by-two\r\nchattering to each other, the pairs being separated by regular\r\nintervals; their bright colours, however, were not apparent at that\r\nheight. After breakfast we devoted the hours from 10 a.m. to 2 or 3\r\np.m. to entomology; the best time for insects in the forest being a\r\nlittle before the greatest heat of the day.\r\n\r\nThe heat increased rapidly towards two o’clock (92° and 93° Fahr.), by\r\nwhich time every voice of bird or mammal was hushed; only in the trees\r\nwas heard at intervals the harsh whirr of a cicada. The leaves, which\r\nwere so moist and fresh in early morning, now become lax and drooping;\r\nthe flowers shed their petals. Our neighbours, the Indian and Mulatto\r\ninhabitants of the open palm-thatched huts, as we returned home\r\nfatigued with our ramble, were either asleep in their hammocks or\r\nseated on mats in the shade, too languid even to talk. On most days in\r\nJune and July a heavy shower would fall some time in the afternoon,\r\nproducing a most welcome coolness. The approach of the rain-clouds was\r\nafter a uniform fashion very interesting to observe. First, the cool\r\nsea-breeze, which commenced to blow about ten o’clock, and which had\r\nincreased in force with the increasing power of the sun, would flag and\r\nfinally die away. The heat and electric tension of the atmosphere would\r\nthen become almost insupportable. Languor and uneasiness would seize on\r\nevery one, even the denizens of the forest, betraying it by their\r\nmotions. White clouds would appear in the cast and gather into cumuli,\r\nwith an increasing blackness along their lower portions. The whole\r\neastern horizon would become almost suddenly black, and this would\r\nspread upwards, the sun at length becoming obscured. Then the rush of a\r\nmighty wind is heard through the forest, swaying the tree-tops; a vivid\r\nflash of lightning bursts forth, then a crash of thunder, and down\r\nstreams the deluging rain. Such storms soon cease, leaving\r\nbluish-black, motionless clouds in the sky until night. Meantime all\r\nnature is refreshed; but heaps of flower-petals and fallen leaves are\r\nseen under the trees. Towards evening life revives again, and the\r\nringing uproar is resumed from bush and tree. The following morning the\r\nsun again rises in a cloudless sky, and so the cycle is completed;\r\nspring, summer, and autumn, as it were, in one tropical day. The days\r\nare more or less like this throughout the year in this country. A\r\nlittle difference exists between the dry and wet seasons; but\r\ngenerally, the dry season, which lasts from July to December, is varied\r\nwith showers, and the wet, from January to June, with sunny days. It\r\nresults from this, that the periodical phenomena of plants and animals\r\ndo not take place at about the same time in all species, or in the\r\nindividuals of any given species, as they do in temperate countries. Of\r\ncourse there is no hybernation; nor, as the dry season is not\r\nexcessive, is there any summer torpidity as in some tropical countries.\r\nPlants do not flower or shed their leaves, nor do birds moult, pair, or\r\nbreed simultaneously. In Europe, a woodland scene has its spring, its\r\nsummer, its autumn, and its winter aspects. In the equatorial forests\r\nthe aspect is the same or nearly so every day in the year: budding,\r\nflowering, fruiting, and leaf shedding are always going on in one\r\nspecies or other. The activity of birds and insects proceeds without\r\ninterruption, each species having its own separate times; the colonies\r\nof wasps, for instance, do not die off annually, leaving only the\r\nqueens, as in cold climates; but the succession of generations and\r\ncolonies goes on incessantly. It is never either spring, summer, or\r\nautumn, but each day is a combination of all three. With the day and\r\nnight always of equal length, the atmospheric disturbances of each day\r\nneutralising themselves before each succeeding morn; with the sun in\r\nits course proceeding midway across the sky, and the daily temperature\r\nthe same within two or three degrees throughout the year—how grand in\r\nits perfect equilibrium and simplicity is the march of Nature under the\r\nequator!\r\n\r\nOur evenings were generally fully employed preserving our collections,\r\nand making notes. We dined at four, and took tea about seven o’clock.\r\nSometimes we walked to the city to see Brazilian life or enjoy the\r\npleasures of European and American society. And so the time passed away\r\nfrom June 15th to August 26th. During this period we made two\r\nexcursions of greater length to the rice and saw-mills of Magoary, an\r\nestablishment owned by an American gentleman, Mr. Upton, situated on\r\nthe banks of a creek in the heart of the forest, about twelve miles\r\nfrom Pará. I will narrate some of the incidents of these excursions,\r\nand give an account of the more interesting observations made on the\r\nNatural History and inhabitants of these interior creeks and forests.\r\n\r\nOur first trip to the mills was by land. The creek on whose banks they\r\nstand, the Iritirí, communicates with the river Pará, through another\r\nlarger creek, the Magoary; so that there is a passage by water; but\r\nthis is about twenty miles round. We started at sunrise, taking Isidoro\r\nwith us. The road plunged at once into the forest after leaving\r\nNazareth, so that in a few minutes we were enveloped in shade. For some\r\ndistance the woods were of second growth, the original forest near the\r\ntown having been formerly cleared or thinned. They were dense and\r\nimpenetrable on account of the close growth of the young trees and the\r\nmass of thorny shrubs and creepers. These thickets swarmed with ants\r\nand ant-thrushes; they were also frequented by a species of\r\npuff-throated manikin, a little bird which flies occasionally across\r\nthe road, emitting a strange noise, made, I believe, with its wings,\r\nand resembling the clatter of a small wooden rattle.\r\n\r\nA mile or a mile and a half further on, the character of the woods\r\nbegan to change, and we then found ourselves in the primæval forest.\r\nThe appearance was greatly different from that of the swampy tract I\r\nhave already described. The land was rather more elevated and\r\nundulating; the many swamp plants with their long and broad leaves were\r\nwanting, and there was less underwood, although the trees were wider\r\napart. Through this wilderness the road continued for seven or eight\r\nmiles. The same unbroken forest extends all the way to Maranham and in\r\nother directions, as we were told, a distance of about 300 miles\r\nsouthward and eastward of Pará. In almost every hollow part the road\r\nwas crossed by a brook, whose cold, dark, leaf-stained waters were\r\nbridged over by tree trunks. The ground was carpeted, as usual, by\r\nLycopodiums, but it was also encumbered with masses of vegetable _\r\ndébris_ and a thick coating of dead leaves. Fruits of many kinds were\r\nscattered about, amongst which were many sorts of beans, some of the\r\npods a foot long, flat and leathery in texture, others hard as stone.\r\nIn one place there was a quantity of large empty wooden vessels, which\r\nIsidoro told us fell from the Sapucaya tree. They are called Monkey’s\r\ndrinking-cups (Cuyas de Macaco), and are the capsules which contain the\r\nnuts sold under the name just mentioned, in Covent Garden Market. At\r\nthe top of the vessel is a circular hole, in which a natural lid fits\r\nneatly. When the nuts are ripe this lid becomes loosened and the heavy\r\ncup falls with a crash, scattering the nuts over the ground. The tree\r\nwhich yields the nut (Lecythis ollaria), is of immense height. It is\r\nclosely allied to the Brazil-nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), whose\r\nseeds are also enclosed in large woody vessels; but these have no lid,\r\nand fall to the ground intact. This is the reason why the one kind of\r\nnut is so much dearer than the other. The Sapucaya is not less\r\nabundant, probably, than the Bertholletia, but its nuts in falling are\r\nscattered about and eaten by wild animals; whilst the full, whole\r\ncapsules of Brazil-nuts are collected by the natives.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted us chiefly were the colossal trees. The general run of\r\ntrees had not remarkably thick stems; the great and uniform height to\r\nwhich they grow without emitting a branch, was a much more noticeable\r\nfeature than their thickness; but at intervals of a furlong or so a\r\nveritable giant towered up. Only one of these monstrous trees can grow\r\nwithin a given space; it monopolises the domain, and none but\r\nindividuals of much inferior size can find a footing near it. The\r\ncylindrical trunks of these larger trees were generally about twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet in circumference. Von Martius mentions having measured\r\ntrees in the Pará district belonging to various species (Symphonia\r\ncoccinea, Lecythis sp. and Cratæva Tapia), which were fifty to sixty\r\nfeet in girth at the point where they become cylindrical. The height of\r\nthe vast column-like stems could not be less than 100 feet from the\r\nground to their lowest branch. Mr. Leavens, at the sawmills, told me\r\nthey frequently squared logs for sawing a hundred feet long, of the Pao\r\nd’Arco and the Massaranduba. The total height of these trees, stem and\r\ncrown together, may be estimated at from 180 to 200 feet; where one of\r\nthem stands, the vast dome of foliage rises above the other forest\r\ntrees as a domed cathedral does above the other buildings in a city.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable feature in these trees is the growth of\r\nbuttress-shaped projections around the lower part of their stems. The\r\nspaces between these buttresses, which are generally thin walls of\r\nwood, form spacious chambers, and may be compared to stalls in a\r\nstable; some of them are large enough to hold a half-dozen persons. The\r\npurpose of these structures is as obvious, at the first glance, as that\r\nof the similar props of brickwork which support a high wall. They are\r\nnot peculiar to one species, but are common to most of the larger\r\nforest trees. Their nature and manner of growth are explained when a\r\nseries of young trees of different ages is examined. It is then seen\r\nthat they are the roots which have raised themselves ridge-like out of\r\nthe earth; growing gradually upwards as the increasing height of the\r\ntree required augmented support. Thus, they are plainly intended to\r\nsustain the massive crown and trunk in these crowded forests, where\r\nlateral growth of the roots in the earth is rendered difficult by the\r\nmultitude of competitors.\r\n\r\nThe other grand forest trees whose native names we learned, were the\r\nMoira-tinga (the White or King-tree), probably the same as, or allied\r\nto, the Mora Excelsa, which Sir Robert Schomburgh discovered in British\r\nGuiana; the Samauma (Eriodendron Samauma) and the Massaranduba, or\r\nCow-tree. The last-mentioned is the most remarkable. We had already\r\nheard a good deal about this tree, and about its producing from its\r\nbark a copious supply of milk as pleasant to drink as that of the cow.\r\nWe had also eaten its fruit in Pará, where it is sold in the streets by\r\nnegro market women; and had heard a good deal of the durableness in\r\nwater of its timber. We were glad, therefore, to see this wonderful\r\ntree growing in its native wilds. It is one of the largest of the\r\nforest monarchs, and is peculiar in appearance on account of its\r\ndeeply-scored reddish and ragged bark. A decoction of the bark, I was\r\ntold, is used as a red dye for cloth. A few days afterwards we tasted\r\nits milk, which was drawn from dry logs that had been standing many\r\ndays in the hot sun, at the saw-mills. It was pleasant with coffee, but\r\nhad a slight rankness when drunk pure; it soon thickens to a glue,\r\nwhich is excessively tenacious, and is often used to cement broken\r\ncrockery. I was told that it was not safe to drink much of it, for a\r\nslave had recently nearly lost his life through taking it too freely.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the road ferns were conspicuous objects. But I\r\nafterwards found them much more numerous on the Maranham road,\r\nespecially in one place where the whole forest glade formed a vast\r\nfernery; the ground was covered with terrestrial species, and the tree\r\ntrunks clothed with climbing and epiphytous kinds. I saw no tree ferns\r\nin the Pará district; they belong to hilly regions; some occur,\r\nhowever, on the Upper Amazons.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal features in the vegetation of the wilderness;\r\nbut where were the flowers? To our great disappointment we saw none, or\r\nonly such as were insignificant in appearance. Orchids are very rare in\r\nthe dense forests of the low lands. I believe it is now tolerably well\r\nascertained that the majority of forest trees in equatorial Brazil have\r\nsmall and inconspicuous flowers. Flower-frequenting insects are also\r\nrare in the forest. Of course they would not be found where their\r\nfavourite food was wanting, but I always noticed that even where\r\nflowers occurred in the forest, few or no insects were seen upon them.\r\nIn the open country or campos of Santarem on the Lower Amazons,\r\nflowering trees and bushes are more abundant, and there a large number\r\nof floral insects are attracted. The forest bees of South America\r\nbelonging to the genera Melipona and Euglossa are more frequently seen\r\nfeeding on the sweet sap which exudes from the trees or on the\r\nexcrement of birds on leaves, rather than on flowers.\r\n\r\nWe were disappointed also in not meeting with any of the larger animals\r\nin the forest. There was no tumultuous movement, or sound of life. We\r\ndid not see or hear monkeys, and no tapir or jaguar crossed our path.\r\nBirds, also, appeared to be exceedingly scarce. We heard, however,\r\noccasionally, the long-drawn, wailing note of the Inambu, a kind of\r\npartridge (Crypturus cinereus?); and, also, in the hollows on the\r\nbanks, of the rivulets, the noisy notes of another bird, which seemed\r\nto go in pairs, amongst the tree-tops, calling to each other as they\r\nwent. These notes resounded through the wilderness. Another solitary\r\nbird had a most sweet and melancholy song; it consisted simply of a few\r\nnotes, uttered in a plaintive key, commencing high, and descending by\r\nharmonic intervals. It was probably a species of warbler of the genus\r\nTrichas. All these notes of birds are very striking and characteristic\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nI afterwards saw reason to modify my opinion, founded on these first\r\nimpressions, with regard to the amount and variety of animal life in\r\nthis and other parts of the Amazonian forests. There is, in fact, a\r\ngreat variety of mammals, birds, and reptiles, but they are widely\r\nscattered, and all excessively shy of man. The region is so extensive,\r\nand uniform in the forest clothing of its surface, that it is only at\r\nlong intervals that animals are seen in abundance when some particular\r\nspot is found which is more attractive than others. Brazil, moreover,\r\nis poor throughout in terrestrial mammals, and the species are of small\r\nsize; they do not, therefore, form a conspicuous feature in its\r\nforests. The huntsman would be disappointed who expected to find here\r\nflocks of animals similar to the buffalo herds of North America, or the\r\nswarms of antelopes and herds of ponderous pachyderms of Southern\r\nAfrica. The largest and most interesting portion of the Brazilian\r\nmammal fauna is arboreal in its habits; this feature of the animal\r\ndenizens of these forests I have already alluded to. The most\r\n_intensely_ arboreal animals in the world are the South American\r\nmonkeys of the family Cebidæ, many of which have a fifth hand for\r\nclimbing in their prehensile tails, adapted for this function by their\r\nstrong muscular development, and the naked palms under their tips. This\r\nseems to teach us that the South American fauna has been slowly adapted\r\nto a forest life, and, therefore, that extensive forests must have\r\nalways existed since the region was first peopled by mammalia. But to\r\nthis subject, and to the natural history of the monkeys, of which\r\nthirty-eight species inhabit the Amazon region, I shall have to return.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterior of Primæval Forest on the Amazons\r\n\r\nWe often read, in books of travels, of the silence and gloom of the\r\nBrazilian forests. They are realities, and the impression deepens on a\r\nlonger acquaintance. The few sounds of birds are of that pensive or\r\nmysterious character which intensifies the feeling of solitude rather\r\nthan imparts a sense of life and cheerfulness. Sometimes, in the midst\r\nof the stillness, a sudden yell or scream will startle one; this comes\r\nfrom some defenseless fruit-eating animal, which is pounced upon by a\r\ntiger-cat or stealthy boa-constrictor. Morning and evening the howling\r\nmonkeys make a most fearful and harrowing noise, under which it is\r\ndifficult to keep up one’s buoyancy of spirit. The feeling of\r\ninhospitable wildness, which the forest is calculated to inspire, is\r\nincreased tenfold under this fearful uproar. Often, even in the still\r\nhours of midday, a sudden crash will be heard resounding afar through\r\nthe wilderness, as some great bough or entire tree falls to the ground.\r\nThere are, besides, many sounds which it is impossible to account for.\r\nI found the natives generally as much at a loss in this respect as\r\nmyself. Sometimes a sound is heard like the clang of an iron bar\r\nagainst a hard, hollow tree, or a piercing cry rends the air; these are\r\nnot repeated, and the succeeding silence tends to heighten the\r\nunpleasant impression which they make on the mind. With the native it\r\nis always the Curupíra, the wild man or spirit of the forest, which\r\nproduces all noises they are unable to explain. For myths are the rude\r\ntheories which mankind, in the infancy of knowledge, invent to explain\r\nnatural phenomena. The Curupíra is a mysterious being, whose attributes\r\nare uncertain, for they vary according to locality. Sometimes he is\r\ndescribed as a kind of orang-otang, being covered with long, shaggy\r\nhair, and living in trees. At others, he is said to have cloven feet\r\nand a bright red face. He has a wife and children, and sometimes comes\r\ndown to the roças to steal the mandioca. At one time I had a Mameluco\r\nyouth in my service, whose head was full of the legends and\r\nsuperstitions of the country. He always went with me into the forest;\r\nin fact, I could not get him to go alone, and whenever we heard any of\r\nthe strange noises mentioned above, he used to tremble with fear. He\r\nwould crouch down behind me, and beg of me to turn back; his alarm\r\nceasing only after he had made a charm to protect us from the Curupíra.\r\nFor this purpose, he took a young palm leaf, plaited it, and formed it\r\ninto a ring, which he hung to a branch on our track.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a six hours’ walk, we arrived at our destination, the\r\nlast mile or two having been again through second-growth forest. The\r\nmills formed a large pile of buildings, pleasantly situated in a\r\ncleared tract of land, many acres in extent, and everywhere surrounded\r\nby the perpetual forest. We were received in the kindest manner by the\r\noverseer, Mr. Leavens, who showed us all that was interesting about the\r\nplace, and took us to the best spots in the neighbourhood for birds and\r\ninsects. The mills were built a long time ago by a wealthy Brazilian.\r\nThey had belonged to Mr. Upton for many years. I was told that when the\r\ndark-skinned revolutionists were preparing for their attack on Pará,\r\nthey occupied the place, but not the slightest injury was done to the\r\nmachinery or building, for the leaders said it was against the\r\nPortuguese and their party that they were at war, not against the other\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe creek Iritirí at the mills is only a few yards wide; it winds about\r\nbetween two lofty walls of forest for some distance, then becomes much\r\nbroader, and finally joins the Magoary. There are many other\r\nramifications, creeks or channels, which lead to retired hamlets and\r\nscattered houses, inhabited by people of mixed white, Indian, and negro\r\ndescent. Many of them did business with Mr. Leavens, bringing for sale\r\ntheir little harvests of rice, or a few logs of timber. It was\r\ninteresting to see them in their little, heavily-laden montarias.\r\nSometimes the boats were managed by handsome, healthy young lads,\r\nloosely clad in a straw hat, white shirt, and dark blue trousers,\r\nturned up to the knee. They steered, paddled, and managed the varejao\r\n(the boating pole), with much grace and dexterity.\r\n\r\nWe made many excursions down the Iritirí, and saw much of these creeks;\r\nbesides, our second visit to the mills was by water. The Magoary is a\r\nmagnificent channel; the different branches form quite a labyrinth, and\r\nthe land is everywhere of little elevation. All these smaller rivers,\r\nthroughout the Pará Estuary, are of the nature of creeks. The land is\r\nso level, that the short local rivers have no sources and downward\r\ncurrents like rivers as we generally understand them. They serve the\r\npurpose of draining the land, but instead of having a constant current\r\none way, they have a regular ebb and flow with the tide. The natives\r\ncall them, in the Tupí language, Igarapés, or canoe-paths. The igarapés\r\nand furos or channels, which are infinite in number in this great river\r\ndelta, are characteristic of the country. The land is everywhere\r\ncovered with impenetrable forests; the houses and villages are all on\r\nthe waterside, and nearly all communication is by water. This\r\nsemi-aquatic life of the people is one of the most interesting features\r\nof the country. For short excursions, and for fishing in still waters,\r\na small boat, called montaria, is universally used. It is made of five\r\nplanks; a broad one for the bottom, bent into the proper shape by the\r\naction of heat, two narrow ones for the sides, and two small triangular\r\npieces for stem and stern. It has no rudder; the paddle serves for both\r\nsteering and propelling. The montaria takes here the place of the\r\nhorse, mule, or camel of other regions. Besides one or more montarias,\r\nalmost every family has a larger canoe, called Igarité. This is fitted\r\nwith two masts, a rudder, and keel, and has an arched awning or cabin\r\nnear the stern, made of a framework of tough lianas thatched with palm\r\nleaves. In the igarité they will cross stormy rivers fifteen or twenty\r\nmiles broad. The natives are all boat-builders. It is often remarked,\r\nby white residents, that an Indian is a carpenter and shipwright by\r\nintuition. It is astonishing to see in what crazy vessels these people\r\nwill risk themselves. I have seen Indians cross rivers in a leaky\r\nmontaria, when it required the nicest equilibrium to keep the leak just\r\nabove water; a movement of a hair’s breadth would send all to the\r\nbottom, but they managed to cross in safety. They are especially\r\ncareful when they have strangers under their charge, and it is the\r\ncustom of Brazilian and Portuguese travellers to leave the whole\r\nmanagement to them. When they are alone they are more reckless, and\r\noften have to swim for their lives. If a squall overtakes them as they\r\nare crossing in a heavily-laden canoe, they all jump overboard and swim\r\nabout until the heavy sea subsides, then they re-embark.\r\n\r\nA few words on the aboriginal population of the Pará estuary will not\r\nbe out of place here. The banks of the Pará were originally inhabited\r\nby a number of distinct tribes, who, in their habits, resembled very\r\nmuch the natives of the sea-coast from Maranham to Bahia. It is related\r\nthat one large tribe, the Tupinambas, migrated from Pernambuco to the\r\nAmazons. One fact seems to be well-established, namely, that all the\r\ncoast tribes were far more advanced in civilisation, and milder in\r\ntheir manners, than the savages who inhabited the interior lands of\r\nBrazil. They were settled in villages, and addicted to agriculture.\r\nThey navigated the rivers in large canoes, called ubas, made of immense\r\nhollowed-out tree trunks; in these they used to go on war expeditions,\r\ncarrying in the prows their trophies and calabash rattles, whose\r\nclatter was meant to intimidate their enemies. They were gentle in\r\ndisposition, and received the early Portuguese settlers with great\r\nfriendliness. The inland savages, on the other hand, led a wandering\r\nlife, as they do at the present time, only coming down occasionally to\r\nrob the plantations of the coast tribes, who always entertained the\r\ngreatest enmity towards them.\r\n\r\nThe original Indian tribes of the district are now either civilised, or\r\nhave amalgamated with the white and negro immigrants. Their\r\ndistinguishing tribal names have long been forgotten, and the race\r\nbears now the general appellation of Tapuyo, which seems to have been\r\none of the names of the ancient Tupinambas. The Indians of the\r\ninterior, still remaining in the savage state, are called by the\r\nBrazilians Indios, or Gentios (Heathens). All the semi-civilised\r\nTapuyos of the villages, and in fact the inhabitants of retired places\r\ngenerally, speak the Lingoa geral, a language adapted by the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries from the original idiom of the Tupinambas. The language of\r\nthe Guaranis, a nation living on the banks of the Paráguay, is a\r\ndialect of it, and hence it is called by philologists the Tupi-Guarani\r\nlanguage; printed grammars of it are always on sale at the shops of the\r\nPará booksellers. The fact of one language having been spoken over so\r\nwide an extent of country as that from the Amazons to Paráguay, is\r\nquite an isolated one in this country, and points to considerable\r\nmigrations of the Indian tribes in former times. At present the\r\nlanguages spoken by neighbouring tribes on the banks of the interior\r\nrivers are totally distinct; on the Juruá, even scattered hordes\r\nbelonging to the same tribe are not able to understand each other.\r\n\r\nThe civilised Tapuyo of Pará differs in no essential point, in physical\r\nor moral qualities, from the Indian of the interior. He is more stoutly\r\nbuilt, being better fed than some of them; but in this respect there\r\nare great differences amongst the tribes themselves. He presents all\r\nthe chief characteristics of the American red man. The skin of a\r\ncoppery brown colour, the features of the face broad, and the hair\r\nblack, thick, and straight. He is generally about the middle height,\r\nthick-set, has a broad muscular chest, well-shaped but somewhat thick\r\nlegs and arms, and small hands and feet. The cheek bones are not\r\ngenerally prominent; the eyes are black, and seldom oblique like those\r\nof the Tartar races of Eastern Asia, which are supposed to have sprung\r\nfrom the same original stock as the American red man. The features\r\nexhibit scarcely any mobility of expression; this is connected with the\r\nexcessively apathetic and undemonstrative character of the race. They\r\nnever betray, in fact they do not feel keenly, the emotions of joy,\r\ngrief, wonder, fear, and so forth. They can never be excited to\r\nenthusiasm; but they have strong affections, especially those connected\r\nwith family. It is commonly stated by the whites and negroes that the\r\nTapuyo is ungrateful. Brazilian mistresses of households, who have much\r\nexperience of Indians, have always a long list of instances to relate\r\nto the stranger, showing their base ingratitude. They certainly do not\r\nappear to remember or think of repaying benefits, but this is probably\r\nbecause they did not require, and do not value such benefits as their\r\nwould-be masters confer upon them. I have known instances of attachment\r\nand fidelity on the part of Indians towards their masters, but these\r\nare exceptional cases. All the actions of the Indian show that his\r\nruling desire is to be let alone; he is attached to his home, his quiet\r\nmonotonous forest and river life; he likes to go to towns occasionally,\r\nto see the wonders introduced by the white man, but he has a great\r\nrepugnance to living in the midst of the crowd; he prefers handicraft\r\nto field labour, and especially dislikes binding himself to regular\r\nlabour for hire. He is shy and uneasy before strangers, but if they\r\nvisit his abode, he treats them well, for he has a rooted appreciation\r\nof the duty of hospitality; there is a pride about him, and being\r\nnaturally formal and polite, he acts the host with great dignity. He\r\nwithdraws from towns as soon as the stir of civilisation begins to make\r\nitself felt. When we first arrived at Pará many Indian families resided\r\nthere, for the mode of living at that time was more like that of a\r\nlarge village than a city; but as soon as river steamers and more\r\nbusiness activity were introduced, they all gradually took themselves\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of the Pará Indians are applicable, of course, to\r\nsome extent, to the Mamelucos, who now constitute a great proportion of\r\nthe population. The inflexibility of character of the Indian, and his\r\ntotal inability to accommodate himself to new arrangements, will\r\ninfallibly lead to his extinction, as immigrants, endowed with more\r\nsupple organisations, increase, and civilisation advances in the Amazon\r\nregion. But, as the different races amalgamate readily, and the\r\noffspring of white and Indian often become distinguished Brazilian\r\ncitizens, there is little reason to regret the fate of the race.\r\nFormerly the Indian was harshly treated, and even now he is so, in many\r\nparts of the interior. But, according to the laws of Brazil, he is a\r\nfree citizen, having equal privileges with the whites; and there are\r\nvery strong enactments providing against the enslaving and\r\nill-treatment of the Indians. The residents of the interior, who have\r\nno higher principles to counteract instinctive selfishness or antipathy\r\nof race, cannot comprehend why they are not allowed to compel Indians\r\nto work for them, seeing that they will not do it of their own accord.\r\nThe inevitable result of the conflict of interests between a European\r\nand a weaker indigenous race, when the two come in contact, is the\r\nsacrifice of the latter. In the Pará district, the Indians are no\r\nlonger enslaved, but they are deprived of their lands, and this they\r\nfeel bitterly, as one of them, an industrious and worthy man, related\r\nto me. Is not a similar state of things now exhibited in New Zealand,\r\nbetween the Maoris and the English colonists?\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to read of the bitter contests that were carried\r\non from the year 1570 to 1759, between the Portuguese immigrants in\r\nBrazil, and the Jesuit and other missionaries. They were similar to\r\nthose which have recently taken place in South Africa, between the\r\nBoers and the English missionaries, but they were on a much larger\r\nscale. The Jesuits, as far as I could glean from tradition and history,\r\nwere actuated by the same motives as our missionaries; and they seemed\r\nlike them to have been, in great measure, successful, in teaching the\r\npure and elevated Christian morality to the simple natives. But the\r\nattempt was vain to protect the weaker race from the inevitable ruin\r\nwhich awaited it in the natural struggle with the stronger one; in\r\n1759, the white colonists finally prevailed, the Jesuits were forced to\r\nleave the country, and the fifty-one happy mission villages went to\r\nruin. Since then, the aboriginal race has gone on decreasing in numbers\r\nunder the treatment which it has received; it is now, as I have already\r\nstated, protected by the laws of the central government.\r\n\r\nOn our second visit to the mills, we stayed ten days. There is a large\r\nreservoir and also a natural lake near the place, both containing\r\naquatic plants, whose leaves rest on the surface like our water lilies,\r\nbut they are not so elegant as our nymphæa, either in leaf or flower.\r\nOn the banks of these pools grow quantities of a species of fan-leaved\r\npalm tree, the Carana, whose stems are surrounded by whorls of strong\r\nspines. I sometimes took a montaria, and paddled myself alone down the\r\ncreek. One day I got upset, and had to land on a grassy slope leading\r\nto an old plantation, where I ran about naked whilst my clothes were\r\nbeing dried on a bush. The creek Iritirí is not so picturesque as many\r\nothers which I subsequently explored. Towards the Magoary, the banks at\r\nthe edge of the water are clothed with mangrove bushes, and beneath\r\nthem the muddy banks into which the long roots that hang down from the\r\nfruit before it leaves the branches strike their fibres, swarm with\r\ncrabs. On the lower branches the beautiful bird, Ardea helias, is\r\nfound. This is a small heron of exquisitely graceful shape and mien;\r\nits plumage is minutely variegated with bars and spots of many colours,\r\nlike the wings of certain kinds of moths. It is difficult to see the\r\nbird in the woods, on account of its sombre colours, and the shadiness\r\nof its dwelling-places; but its note, a soft long-drawn whistle, often\r\nbetrays its hiding place. I was told by the Indians that it builds in\r\ntrees, and that the nest, which is made of clay, is beautifully\r\nconstructed. It is a favourite pet-bird of the Brazilians, who call it\r\nPavao (pronounced Pavaong), or peacock. I often had opportunities to\r\nobserve its habits. It soon becomes tame, and walks about the floors of\r\nhouses picking up scraps of food or catching insects, which it secures\r\nby walking gently to the place where they settle, and spearing them\r\nwith its long, slender beak. It allows itself to be handled by\r\nchildren, and will answer to its name “Pavao! Pavao!” walking up with a\r\ndainty, circumspect gait, and taking a fly or beetle from the hand.\r\n\r\nDuring these rambles by land and water we increased our collections\r\nconsiderably. Before we left the mills, we arranged a joint excursion\r\nto the Tocantins. Mr. Leavens wished to ascend that river to ascertain\r\nif the reports were true, that cedar grew abundantly between the\r\nlowermost cataract and the mouth of the Araguava, and we agreed to\r\naccompany him.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were at the mills, a Portuguese trader arrived with a\r\nquantity of worm-eaten logs of this cedar, which he had gathered from\r\nthe floating timber in the current of the main Amazons. The tree\r\nproducing this wood, which is named cedar on account of the similarity\r\nof its aroma to that of the true cedars, is not, of course, a\r\nconiferous tree, as no member of that class is found in equatorial\r\nAmerica, at least in the Amazons region. It is, according to Von\r\nMartius, the Cedrela Odorata, an exogen belonging to the same order as\r\nthe mahogany tree. The wood is light, and the tree is therefore, on\r\nfalling into the water, floated down with the river currents. It must\r\ngrow in great quantities somewhere in the interior, to judge from the\r\nnumber of uprooted trees annually carried to the sea, and as the wood\r\nis much esteemed for cabinet work and canoe building, it is of some\r\nimportance to learn where a regular supply can be obtained. We were\r\nglad of course to arrange with Mr. Leavens, who was familiar with the\r\nlanguage, and an adept in river navigation—so we returned to Pará to\r\nship our collections for England, and prepare for the journey to a new\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nPARÁ\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious Holidays — Marmoset Monkeys — Serpents — Insects\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of Pará, where I resided, as already stated,\r\nin all eighteen months, it will be necessary to give a more detailed\r\naccount of several matters connected with the customs of the people and\r\nthe Natural History of the neighbourhood, which have hitherto been only\r\nbriefly mentioned. I reserve an account of the trade and improved\r\ncondition of Pará in 1859 for the end of this narrative.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few weeks of our stay, many of those religious\r\nfestivals took place, which occupied so large a share of the time and\r\nthoughts of the people. These were splendid affairs, wherein\r\nartistically-arranged processions through the streets, accompanied by\r\nthousands of people, military displays, the clatter of fireworks, and\r\nthe clang of military music, were super-added to pompous religious\r\nservices in the churches. To those who had witnessed similar ceremonies\r\nin the Southern countries of Europe, there would be nothing remarkable\r\nperhaps in these doings, except their taking place amidst the\r\nsplendours of tropical nature; but to me they were full of novelty, and\r\nwere besides interesting as exhibiting much that was peculiar in the\r\nmanners of the people. The festivals celebrate either the anniversaries\r\nof events concerning saints, or those of the more important\r\ntransactions in the life of Christ. To them have been added, since the\r\nIndependence, many gala days connected with the events in the Brazilian\r\nnational history; but these have all a semi-religious character. The\r\nholidays had become so numerous, and interfered so much with trade and\r\nindustry towards the year 1852, that the Brazilian Government was\r\nobliged to reduce them; obtaining the necessary permission from Rome to\r\nabolish several which were of minor importance. Many of those which\r\nhave been retained are declining in importance since the introduction\r\nof railways and steamboats, and the increased devotion of the people to\r\ncommerce; at the time of our arrival, however, they were in full glory.\r\nThe way they were managed was in this fashion. A general manager or\r\n“Juiz” for each festival was elected by lot every year in the vestry of\r\nthe church, and to him were handed over all the paraphernalia\r\npertaining to the particular festival which he was chosen to manage;\r\nthe image of the saint, the banners, silver crowns and so forth. He\r\nthen employed a number of people to go the round of the parish, and\r\ncollect alms towards defraying the expenses. It was considered that the\r\ngreater the amount of money spent in wax candles, fireworks, music and\r\nfeasting, the greater the honour done to the saint. If the Juiz was a\r\nrich man, he seldom sent out alms-gatherers, but celebrated the whole\r\naffair at his own expense, which was sometimes to the extent of several\r\nhundred pounds. Each festival lasted nine days (a _novena_), and in\r\nmany cases refreshments for the public were provided every evening. In\r\nthe smaller towns a ball took place two or three evenings during the\r\nnovena, and on the last day there was a grand dinner. The priest, of\r\ncourse, had to be paid very liberally, especially for the sermon\r\ndelivered on the Saint’s-day or termination of the festival, sermons\r\nbeing extra duty in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThere was much difference as to the accessories of these festivals\r\nbetween the interior towns and villages and the capital; but little or\r\nno work was done anywhere whilst they lasted, and they tended much to\r\ndemoralise the people. It was soon perceived that religion is rather\r\nthe amusement of the Paráenses, than their serious exercise. The ideas\r\nof the majority evidently do not reach beyond the belief that all the\r\nproceedings are, in each case, in honour of the particular wooden image\r\nenshrined at the church. The uneducated Portuguese immigrants seemed to\r\nme to have very degrading notions of religion. I have often travelled\r\nin the company of these shining examples of European enlightenment.\r\nThey generally carry with them, wherever they go, a small image of some\r\nfavourite saint in their trunks, and when a squall or any other danger\r\narises, their first impulse is to rush to the cabin, take out the image\r\nand clasp it to their lips, whilst uttering a prayer for protection.\r\nThe negroes and mulattos are similar in this respect to the low\r\nPortuguese, but I think they show a purer devotional feeling; and in\r\nconversation, I have always found them to be more rational in religious\r\nviews than the lower orders of Portuguese. As to the Indians; with the\r\nexception of the more civilised families residing near the large towns,\r\nthey exhibit no religious sentiment at all. They have their own patron\r\nsaint, St. Thomé, and celebrate his anniversary in the orthodox way,\r\nfor they are fond of observing all the formalities; but they think the\r\nfeasting to be of equal importance with the church ceremonies. At some\r\nof the festivals, masquerading forms a large part of the proceedings,\r\nand then the Indians really shine. They get up capital imitations of\r\nwild animals, dress themselves to represent the Caypor and other\r\nfabulous creatures of the forest, and act their parts throughout with\r\ngreat cleverness. When St. Thome’s festival takes place, every employer\r\nof Indians knows that all his men will get drunk. The Indian, generally\r\ntoo shy to ask directly for cashaca (rum), is then very bold; he asks\r\nfor a frasco at once (two-and-a-half bottles), and says, if\r\ninterrogated, that he is going to fuddle in honour of St. Thomé.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Pará, the provincial government assists to augment the\r\nsplendour of the religious holidays. The processions which traverse the\r\nprincipal streets consist, in the first place, of the image of the\r\nsaint, and those of several other subordinate ones belonging to the\r\nsame church; these are borne on the shoulders of respectable\r\nhouseholders, who volunteer for the purpose: sometimes you will see\r\nyour neighbour the grocer or the carpenter groaning under the load. The\r\npriest and his crowd of attendants precede the images, arrayed in\r\nembroidered robes, and protected by magnificent sunshades—no useless\r\nornament here, for the heat is very great when the sun is not obscured.\r\nOn each side of the long line the citizens walk, clad in crimson silk\r\ncloaks and holding each a large lighted wax candle. Behind follows a\r\nregiment or two of foot soldiers with their bands of music, and last of\r\nall the crowd: the coloured people being cleanly dressed and preserving\r\na grave demeanour. The women are always in great force, their luxuriant\r\nblack hair decorated with jasmines, white orchids and other tropical\r\nflowers. They are dressed in their usual holiday attire, gauze chemises\r\nand black silk petticoats; their necks are adorned with links of gold\r\nbeads, which when they are slaves are generally the property of their\r\nmistresses, who love thus to display their wealth.\r\n\r\nAt night, when festivals are going on in the grassy squares around the\r\nsuburban churches, there is really much to admire. A great deal that is\r\npeculiar in the land and the life of its inhabitants can be seen best\r\nat those times. The cheerful white church is brilliantly lighted up,\r\nand the music, not of a very solemn description, peals forth from the\r\nopen windows and doors. Numbers of young gaudily-dressed negresses line\r\nthe path to the church doors with stands of liqueurs, sweetmeats, and\r\ncigarettes, which they sell to the outsiders. A short distance off is\r\nheard the rattle of dice-boxes and roulette at the open-air\r\ngambling-stalls. When the festival happens on moonlit nights, the whole\r\nscene is very striking to a newcomer. Around the square are groups of\r\ntall palm trees, and beyond it, over the illuminated houses, appear the\r\nthick groves of mangoes near the suburban avenues, from which comes the\r\nperpetual ringing din of insect life. The soft tropical moonlight lends\r\na wonderful charm to the whole. The inhabitants are all out, dressed in\r\ntheir best. The upper classes, who come to enjoy the fine evening and\r\nthe general cheerfulness, are seated on chairs around the doors of\r\nfriendly houses. There is no boisterous conviviality, but a quiet\r\nenjoyment seems to be felt everywhere, and a gentle courtesy rules\r\namongst all classes and colours. I have seen a splendidly-dressed\r\ncolonel, from the President’s palace, walk up to a mulatto, and\r\npolitely ask his permission to take a light from his cigar. When the\r\nservice is over, the church bells are set ringing, a shower of rockets\r\nmounts upwards, the bands strike up, and parties of coloured people in\r\nthe booths begin their dances. About ten o’clock the Brazilian national\r\nair is played, and all disperse quietly and soberly to their homes.\r\n\r\nAt the festival of Corpus Christi, there was a very pretty arrangement.\r\nThe large green square of the Trinidade was lighted up all round with\r\nbonfires. On one side a fine pavilion was erected, the upright posts\r\nconsisting of real fan-leaved palm trees—the Mauritia flexuosa, which\r\nhad been brought from the forest, stems and heads entire, and fixed in\r\nthe ground. The booth was illuminated with coloured lamps, and lined\r\nwith red and white cloth. In it were seated the ladies, not all of pure\r\nCaucasian blood, but presenting a fine sample of Pará beauty and\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe grandest of all these festivals is that held in honour of Our Lady\r\nof Nazareth: it is, I believe, peculiar to Pará. As I have said before,\r\nit falls in the second quarter of the moon, about the middle of the dry\r\nseason—that is, in October or November—and lasts, like the others, nine\r\ndays. On the first day, a very extensive procession takes place,\r\nstarting from the Cathedral, whither the image of the saint had been\r\nconveyed some days previous, and terminating at the chapel or\r\nhermitage, as it is called, of the saint at Nazareth, a distance of\r\nmore than two miles. The whole population turns out on this occasion.\r\nAll the soldiers, both of the line and the National Guard, take part in\r\nit, each battalion accompanied by its band of music. The civil\r\nauthorities, also, with the President at their head, and the principal\r\ncitizens, including many of the foreign residents, join in the line.\r\nThe boat of the shipwrecked Portuguese vessel is carried after the\r\nsaint on the shoulders of officers or men of the Brazilian navy, and\r\nalong with it are borne the other symbols of the miracles which Our\r\nLady is supposed to have performed. The procession starts soon after\r\nthe sun’s heat begins to moderate—that is, about half-past four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon. When the image is deposited in the chapel the\r\nfestival is considered to be inaugurated, and the village every evening\r\nbecomes the resort of the pleasure-loving population, the holiday\r\nportion of the programme being preceded, of course, by a religious\r\nservice in the chapel. The aspect of the place is then that of a fair,\r\nwithout the humour and fun, but, at the same time, without the noise\r\nand coarseness of similar holidays in England. Large rooms are set\r\napart for panoramic and other exhibitions, to which the public is\r\nadmitted gratis. In the course of each evening, large displays of\r\nfireworks take place, all arranged according to a published programme\r\nof the festival.\r\n\r\nThe various ceremonies which take place during Lent seemed to me the\r\nmost impressive, and some of them were exceedingly well- arranged. The\r\npeople, both performers and spectators, conduct themselves with more\r\ngravity on these occasions, and there is no holiday-making.\r\nPerformances, representing the last events in the life of Christ, are\r\nenacted in the churches or streets in such a way as to remind one of\r\nthe old miracle plays or mysteries. A few days before Good Friday, a\r\ntorchlight procession takes place by night from one church to another,\r\nin which is carried a large wooden image of Christ bent under the\r\nweight of the cross. The chief members of the government assist, and\r\nthe whole slowly moves to the sound of muffled drums. A double\r\nprocession is managed a few days afterwards. The image of St. Mary is\r\ncarried in one direction, and that of the Saviour in another. The two\r\nimages meet in the middle of one of the most beautiful of the churches,\r\nwhich is previously filled to excess with the multitudes anxious to\r\nwitness the affecting meeting of mother and son a few days before the\r\ncrucifixion. The images are brought face to face in the middle of the\r\nchurch, the crowd falls prostrate, and a lachrymose sermon is delivered\r\nfrom the pulpit. The whole thing, as well as many other spectacles\r\narranged during the few succeeding days, is highly theatrical and well\r\ncalculated to excite the religious emotions of the people, although,\r\nperhaps, only temporarily. On Good Friday the bells do not ring, all\r\nmusical sounds are interdicted, and the hours, night and day, are\r\nannounced by the dismal noise of wooden clappers, wielded by negroes\r\nstationed near the different churches. A sermon is delivered in each\r\nchurch. In the middle of it, a scroll is suddenly unfolded from the\r\npulpit, upon which is an exaggerated picture of the bleeding Christ.\r\nThis act is accompanied by loud groans, which come from stout-lunged\r\nindividuals concealed in the vestry and engaged for the purpose. The\r\npriest becomes greatly excited, and actually sheds tears. On one of\r\nthese occasions I squeezed myself into the crowd, and watched the\r\neffect of the spectacle on the audience. Old Portuguese men and\r\nBrazilian women seemed very much affected—sobbing, beating their\r\nbreasts, and telling their beads. The negroes themselves behaved with\r\ngreat propriety, but seemed moved more particularly by the pomp, the\r\ngilding, the dresses, and the general display. Young Brazilians\r\nlaughed. Several aborigines were there, coolly looking on. One old\r\nIndian, who was standing near me, said, in a derisive manner, when the\r\nsermon was over: “It’s all very good; better it could not be” (Está\r\ntodo bom; melhor nao pude ser).\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Pará are very devout. They have built, by slow degrees,\r\nas I was told, a fine church by their own unaided exertions. It is\r\ncalled Nossa Senhora do Rosario, or Our Lady of the Rosary. During the\r\nfirst weeks of our residence at Pará, I frequently observed a line of\r\nnegroes and negresses, late at night, marching along the streets,\r\nsinging a chorus. Each carried on his or her head a quantity of\r\nbuilding materials—stones, bricks, mortar, or planks. I found they were\r\nchiefly slaves, who, after their hard day’s work, were contributing a\r\nlittle towards the construction of their church. The materials had all\r\nbeen purchased by their own savings. The interior was finished about a\r\nyear afterwards, and is decorated, I thought, quite as superbly as the\r\nother churches which were constructed, with far larger means, by the\r\nold religious orders more than a century ago. Annually, the negroes\r\ncelebrate the festival of Nossa Senhora do Rosario, and generally make\r\nit a complete success.\r\n\r\nI will now add a few more notes which I have accumulated on the subject\r\nof the natural history, and then we shall have done, for the present,\r\nwith Pará and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that monkeys were rare in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Pará. I met with only three species in the forest near the\r\ncity; they are shy animals, and avoid the neighbourhood of towns, where\r\nthey are subject to much persecution by the inhabitants, who kill them\r\nfor food. The only kind which I saw frequently was the little Midas\r\nursulus, one of the Marmosets, a family peculiar to tropical America,\r\nand differing in many essential points of structure and habits from all\r\nother apes. They are small in size, and more like squirrels than true\r\nmonkeys in their manner of climbing. The nails, except those of the\r\nhind thumbs, are long and claw-shaped like those of squirrels, and the\r\nthumbs of the fore extremities, or hands, are not opposable to the\r\nother fingers. I do not mean to imply that they have a near\r\nrelationship to squirrels, which belong to the Rodents, an inferior\r\norder of mammals; their resemblance to those animals is merely a\r\nsuperficial one. They have two molar teeth less in each jaw than the\r\nCebidæ, the other family of American monkeys; they agree with them,\r\nhowever, in the sideway position of the nostrils, a character which\r\ndistinguishes both from all the monkeys of the old world. The body is\r\nlong and slender, clothed with soft hairs, and the tail, which is\r\nnearly twice the length of the trunk, is not prehensile. The hind limbs\r\nare much larger in volume than the anterior pair. The Midas ursulus is\r\nnever seen in large flocks; three or four is the greatest number\r\nobserved together. It seems to be less afraid of the neighbourhood of\r\nman than any other monkey. I sometimes saw it in the woods which border\r\nthe suburban streets, and once I espied two individuals in a thicket\r\nbehind the English consul’s house at Nazareth. Its mode of progression\r\nalong the main boughs of the lofty trees is like that of the squirrel;\r\nit does not ascend to the slender branches, or take those wonderful\r\nflying leaps which the Cebidæ do, whose prehensile tails and flexible\r\nhands fit them for such headlong travelling. It confines itself to the\r\nlarger boughs and trunks of trees, the long nails being of great\r\nassistance to the creature, enabling it to cling securely to the bark,\r\nand it is often seen passing rapidly around the perpendicular\r\ncylindrical trunks. It is a quick, restless, timid little creature, and\r\nhas a great share of curiosity, for when a person passes by under the\r\ntrees along which a flock is running, they always stop for a few\r\nmoments to have a stare at the intruder. In Pará, Midas ursulus is\r\noften seen in a tame state in the houses of the inhabitants. When full\r\ngrown it is about nine inches long, independently of the tail, which\r\nmeasures fifteen inches. The fur is thick, and black in colour, with\r\nthe exception of a reddish-brown streak down the middle of the back.\r\nWhen first taken, or when kept tied up, it is very timid and irritable.\r\nIt will not allow itself to be approached, but keeps retreating\r\nbackwards when any one attempts to coax it. It is always in a querulous\r\nhumour, uttering a twittering, complaining noise; its dark, watchful\r\neyes are expressive of distrust, and observant of every movement which\r\ntakes place near it. When treated kindly, however, as it generally is\r\nin the houses of the natives, it becomes very tame and familiar. I once\r\nsaw one as playful as a kitten, running about the house after the negro\r\nchildren, who fondled it to their hearts’ content. It acted somewhat\r\ndifferently towards strangers, and seemed not to like them to sit in\r\nthe hammock which was slung in the room, leaping up, trying to bite,\r\nand otherwise annoying them. It is generally fed sweet fruits, such as\r\nthe banana; but it is also fond of insects, especially soft-bodied\r\nspiders and grasshoppers, which it will snap up with eagerness when\r\nwithin reach. The expression of countenance in these small monkeys is\r\nintelligent and pleasing. This is partly owing to the open facial\r\nangle, which is given as one of 60°; but the quick movements of the\r\nhead, and the way they have of inclining it to one side when their\r\ncuriosity is excited, contribute very much to give them a knowing\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nOn the Upper Amazons I once saw a tame individual of the Midas\r\nleoninus, a species first described by Humboldt, which was still more\r\nplayful and intelligent than the one just described. This rare and\r\nbeautiful little monkey is only seven inches in length, exclusive of\r\nthe tail. It is named leoninus on account of the long brown mane which\r\ndepends from the neck, and which gives it very much the appearance of a\r\ndiminutive lion. In the house where it was kept, it was familiar with\r\neveryone; its greatest pleasure seeming to be to climb about the bodies\r\nof different persons who entered. The first time I went in, it ran\r\nacross the room straightway to the chair on which I had sat down, and\r\nclimbed up to my shoulder; having arrived there, it turned round and\r\nlooked into my face, showing its little teeth and chattering, as though\r\nit would say, “Well, and how do _you_ do?” It showed more affection\r\ntowards its master than towards strangers, and would climb up to his\r\nhead a dozen times in the course of an hour, making a great show every\r\ntime of searching there for certain animalcula. Isidore Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire relates of a species of this genus, that it distinguished\r\nbetween different objects depicted on an engraving. M. Audouin showed\r\nit the portraits of a cat and a wasp; at these it became much\r\nterrified; whereas, at the sight of a figure of a grasshopper or\r\nbeetle, it precipitated itself on the picture, as if to seize the\r\nobjects there represented.\r\n\r\nAlthough monkeys are now rare in a wild state near Pará, a great number\r\nmay be seen semi-domesticated in the city. The Brazilians are fond of\r\npet animals. Monkeys, however, have not been known to breed in\r\ncaptivity in this country. I counted, in a short time, thirteen\r\ndifferent species, whilst walking about the Pará streets, either at the\r\ndoors or windows of houses, or in the native canoes. Two of them I did\r\nnot meet with afterwards in any other part of the country. One of these\r\nwas the well-known Hapale Jacchus, a little creature resembling a\r\nkitten, banded with black and grey all over the body and tail, and\r\nhaving a fringe of long white hairs surrounding the ears. It was seated\r\non the shoulder of a young mulatto girl, as she was walking along the\r\nstreet, and I was told had been captured in the island of Marajo. The\r\nother was a species of Cebus, with a remarkably large head. It had\r\nruddy-brown fur, paler on the face, but presenting a blackish tuft on\r\nthe top of the forehead.\r\n\r\nIn the wet season serpents are common in the neighbourhood of Pará. One\r\nmorning, in April, 1849, after a night of deluging rain, the\r\nlamplighter, on his rounds to extinguish the lamps, woke me up to show\r\nme a boa-constrictor he had just killed in the Rua St. Antonio, not far\r\nfrom my door. He had cut it nearly in two with a large knife, as it was\r\nmaking its way down the sandy street. Sometimes the native hunters\r\ncapture boa- constrictors alive in the forest near the city. We bought\r\none which had been taken in this way, and kept it for some time in a\r\nlarge box under our verandah. This is not, however, the largest or most\r\nformidable serpent found in the Amazons region. It is far inferior, in\r\nthese respects, to the hideous Sucurujú, or Water Boa (Eunectes\r\nmurinus), which sometimes attacks man; but of this I shall have to give\r\nan account in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happened, in passing through the thickets, that a snake\r\nwould fall from the boughs close to me. Once for a few moments I got\r\ncompletely entangled in the folds of one, a wonderfully slender kind,\r\nbeing nearly six feet in length, and not more than half an inch in\r\ndiameter at its broadest part. It was a species of Dryophis. The\r\nmajority of the snakes seen were innocuous. One day, however, I trod on\r\nthe tail of a young serpent belonging to a very poisonous kind, the\r\nJararaca (Craspedocephalus atrox). It turned round and bit my trousers;\r\nand a young Indian lad, who was behind me, dexterously cut it through\r\nwith his knife before it had time to free itself. In some seasons\r\nsnakes are very abundant, and it often struck me as strange that\r\naccidents did not occur more frequently than was the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmphisbæna.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most curious snakes found here were the Amphisbænæ, a genus\r\nallied to the slow-worm of Europe. Several species occur at Pará. Those\r\nbrought to me were generally not much more than a foot in length. They\r\nare of cylindrical shape, having, properly speaking, no neck, and the\r\nblunt tail which is only about an inch in length, is of the same shape\r\nas the head. This peculiar form, added to their habit of wriggling\r\nbackwards as well as forwards, has given rise to the fable that they\r\nhave two heads, one at each extremity. They are extremely sluggish in\r\ntheir motions, and are clothed with scales that have the form of small\r\nimbedded plates arranged in rings round the body. The eye is so small\r\nas to be scarcely perceptible. They live habitually in the subterranean\r\nchambers of the Saüba ant; only coming out of their abodes occasionally\r\nin the night time. The natives call the Amphisbæna the “Mai das\r\nSaübas,” or Mother of the Saübas, and believe it to be poisonous,\r\nalthough it is perfectly harmless. It is one of the many curious\r\nanimals which have become the subject of mythical stories with the\r\nnatives. They say the ants treat it with great affection, and that if\r\nthe snake be taken away from a nest, the Saübas will forsake the spot.\r\nI once took one quite whole out of the body of a young Jararaca, the\r\npoisonous species already alluded to, whose body was so distended with\r\nits contents that the skin was stretched out to a film over the\r\ncontained Amphisbæna. I was, unfortunately, not able to ascertain the\r\nexact relation which subsists between these curious snakes and the\r\nSaüba ants. I believe however, they feed upon the Saübas, for I once\r\nfound remains of ants in the stomach of one of them. Their motions are\r\nquite peculiar; the undilatable jaws, small eyes and curious plated\r\nintegument also distinguish them from other snakes. These properties\r\nhave evidently some relation to their residence in the subterranean\r\nabodes of ants. It is now well ascertained by naturalists, that some of\r\nthe most anomalous forms amongst Coleopterous insects are those which\r\nlive solely in the nests of ants, and it is curious that an abnormal\r\nform of snakes should also be found in the society of these insects.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Pará is rich in insects. I do not speak of the\r\nnumber of individuals, which is probably less than one meets with,\r\nexcepting ants and termites, in summer days in temperate latitudes; but\r\nthe variety, or in other words, the number of species, is very great.\r\nIt will convey some idea of the diversity of butterflies when I mention\r\nthat about 700 species of that tribe are found within an hour’s walk of\r\nthe town; whilst the total number found in the British Islands does not\r\nexceed 66, and the whole of Europe supports only 321. Some of the most\r\nshowy species, such as the swallow-tailed kinds, Papilio Polycaon,\r\nThoas, Torquatus, and others, are seen flying about the streets and\r\ngardens; sometimes they come through the open windows, attracted by\r\nflowers in the apartments. Those species of Papilio which are most\r\ncharacteristic of the country, so conspicuous in their velvety-black,\r\ngreen, and rose-coloured hues, which Linnæus, in pursuance of his\r\nelegant system of nomenclature—naming the different kinds after the\r\nheroes of Greek mythology—called Trojans, never leave the shades of the\r\nforest. The splendid metallic blue Morphos, some of which measure seven\r\ninches in expanse, are generally confined to the shady alleys of the\r\nforest. They sometimes come forth into the broad sunlight. When we\r\nfirst went to look at our new residence in Nazareth, a Morpho Menelaus,\r\none of the most beautiful kinds, was seen flapping its huge wings like\r\na bird along the verandah. This species, however, although much\r\nadmired, looks dull in colour by the side of its congener, the Morpho\r\nRhetenor, whose wings, on the upper face, are of quite a dazzling\r\nlustre. Rhetenor usually prefers the broad sunny roads in the forest,\r\nand is an almost unattainable prize, on account of its lofty flight,\r\nfor it very rarely descends nearer the ground than about twenty feet.\r\nWhen it comes sailing along, it occasionally flaps its wings, and then\r\nthe blue surface flashes in the sunlight, so that it is visible a\r\nquarter of a mile off. There is another species of this genus, of a\r\nsatiny-white hue, the Morpho Uraneis; this is equally difficult to\r\nobtain; the male only has the satiny lustre, the female being of a\r\npale-lavender colour. It is in the height of the dry season that the\r\ngreatest number and variety of butterflies are found in the woods;\r\nespecially when a shower falls at intervals of a few days. An infinite\r\nnumber of curious and rare species may then be taken, most diversified\r\nin habits, mode of flight, colours, and markings: some yellow, others\r\nbright red, green, purple, and blue, and many bordered or spangled with\r\nmetallic lines and spots of a silvery or golden lustre. Some have wings\r\ntransparent as glass; one of these clear wings is especially beautiful,\r\nnamely, the Hetaira Esmeralda. It has one spot only of opaque colouring\r\non its wings, which is of a violet and rose hue; this is the only part\r\nvisible when the insect is flying low over dead leaves in the gloomy\r\nshades where alone it is found, and it then looks like a wandering\r\npetal of a flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcrosoma arcuatum.\r\n\r\nBees and wasps are not especially numerous near Pará, and I will\r\nreserve an account of their habits for a future chapter. Many species\r\nof Mygale, those monstrous hairy spiders, half a foot in expanse, which\r\nattract the attention so much in museums, are found in sandy places at\r\nNazareth. The different kinds have the most diversified habits. Some\r\nconstruct, amongst the tiles or thatch of houses, dens of closely-woven\r\nweb, which, in its texture, very much resembles fine muslin; these are\r\noften seen crawling over the walls of apartments. Others build similar\r\nnests in trees, and are known to attack birds. One very robust fellow,\r\nthe Mygale Blondii, burrows into the earth, forming a broad, slanting\r\ngallery, about two feet long, the sides of which he lines beautifully\r\nwith silk. He is nocturnal in his habits. Just before sunset he may be\r\nseen keeping watch within the mouth of his tunnel, disappearing\r\nsuddenly when he hears a heavy foot-tread near his hiding place. The\r\nnumber of spiders ornamented with showy colours was somewhat\r\nremarkable. Some double themselves up at the base of leaf-stalks, so as\r\nto resemble flower-buds, and thus deceive the insects on which they\r\nprey. The most extraordinary-looking spider was a species of Acrosoma,\r\nwhich had two curved bronze-coloured spines, an inch and a half in\r\nlength, proceeding from the tip of its abdomen. It spins a large web,\r\nthe monstrous appendages being apparently no impediment to it in its\r\nwork; but what their use can be I am unable to divine.\r\n\r\nColeoptera, or beetles, at first seemed to be very scarce. This\r\napparent scarcity has been noticed in other equatorial countries, and\r\narises, probably, from the great heat of the sun not permitting them to\r\nexist in exposed situations, where they form such conspicuous objects\r\nin Europe. Many hundred species of the different families can be found\r\nwhen they are patiently searched for in the shady places to which they\r\nare confined. It is vain to look for the Geodephaga, or carnivorous\r\nbeetles, under stones, or anywhere, indeed, in open, sunny places. The\r\nterrestrial forms of this interesting family, which abound in England\r\nand temperate countries generally, are scarce in the neighbourhood of\r\nPará; in fact, I met with only four or five species; on the other hand,\r\nthe purely arboreal kinds were rather numerous. The contrary of this\r\nhappens in northern latitudes, where the great majority of the species\r\nand genera are exclusively terrestrial. The arboreal forms are\r\ndistinguished by the structure of the feet, which have broad spongy\r\nsoles and toothed claws, enabling them to climb over and cling to\r\nbranches and leaves. The remarkable scarcity of ground beetles is,\r\ndoubtless, attributable to the number of ants and Termites which people\r\nevery inch of surface in all shady places, and which would most likely\r\ndestroy the larvæ of Coleoptera. Moreover, these active creatures have\r\nthe same functions as Coleoptera, and thus render their existence\r\nunnecessary. The large proportion of climbing forms of carnivorous\r\nbeetles is an interesting fact, because it affords another instance of\r\nthe arboreal character which animal forms tend to assume in equinoctial\r\nAmerica, a circumstance which points to the slow adaptation of the\r\nfauna to a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of\r\ngeological time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\nTHE TOCANTINS AND CAMETÁ\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparations for the journey — The Bay of Goajará — Grove of fan-leaved\r\nPalms — The lower Tocantins — Sketch of the River — Vista alegre —\r\nBaiao — Rapids — Boat journey to the Guariba Falls — Native Life on the\r\nTocantins — Second Journey to Cameta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 26th, 1848_—Mr. Wallace and I started today on the excursion\r\nwhich I have already mentioned as having been planned with Mr. Leavens,\r\nup the river Tocantins, whose mouth lies about forty-five miles in a\r\nstraight line, but eighty miles following the bends of the river\r\nchannels to the southwest of Pará. This river, as before stated, has a\r\ncourse of 1600 miles, and stands third in rank amongst the streams\r\nwhich form the Amazons system. The preparations for the journey took a\r\ngreat deal of time and trouble. We had first to hire a proper vessel, a\r\ntwo-masted _ vigilinga_ twenty-seven feet long, with a flat prow and\r\ngreat breadth of beam and fitted to live in heavy seas; for, although\r\nour voyage was only a river trip, there were vast sea-like expanses of\r\nwater to traverse. It was not decked over, but had two arched awnings\r\nformed of strong wickerwork, and thatched with palm leaves. We then had\r\nto store it with provisions for three months, the time we at first\r\nintended to be away; procure the necessary passports; and, lastly,\r\nengage a crew. Mr. Leavens, having had much experience in the country,\r\nmanaged all these matters. He brought two Indians from the rice-mills,\r\nand these induced another to enrol himself. We, on our parts, took our\r\ncook Isidoro, and a young Indian lad, named Antonio, who had attached\r\nhimself to us in the course of our residence at Nazareth. Our principal\r\nman was Alexandro, one of Mr. Leavens’s Indians. He was an intelligent\r\nand well-disposed young Tapuyo, an expert sailor, and an indefatigable\r\nhunter. To his fidelity we were indebted for being enabled to carry out\r\nany of the objects of our voyage. Being a native of a district near the\r\ncapital, Alexandro was a civilised Tapuyo, a citizen as free as his\r\nwhite neighbours. He spoke only Portuguese. He was a spare-built man,\r\nrather under the middle height, with fine regular features, and, what\r\nwas unusual in Indians, the upper lip decorated with a moustache. Three\r\nyears afterwards I saw him at Pará in the uniform of the National\r\nGuard, and he called on me often to talk about old times. I esteemed\r\nhim as a quiet, sensible, manly young fellow.\r\n\r\nWe set sail in the evening, after waiting several hours in vain for one\r\nof our crew. It was soon dark, the wind blew stiffly, and the tide\r\nrushed along with great rapidity, carrying us swiftly past the crowd of\r\nvessels which were anchored in the port. The canoe rolled a good deal.\r\nAfter we had made five or six miles of way, the tide turned and we were\r\nobliged to cast anchor. Not long after, we lay ourselves down, all\r\nthree together, on the mat which was spread over the floor of our\r\ncabin, and soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nOn awaking at sunrise the next morning, we found ourselves gliding\r\nupwards with the tide, along the Bahia or Bay, as it is called, of\r\nGoajará. This is a broad channel lying between the mainland and a line\r\nof islands which extends some distance beyond the city. Into it three\r\nlarge rivers discharge their waters, namely, the Guamá, the Acará, and\r\nthe Mojú; so that it forms a kind of sub-estuary within the grand\r\nestuary of Pará. It is nearly four miles broad. The left bank, along\r\nwhich we were now sailing, was beautiful in the extreme; not an inch of\r\nsoil was to be seen; the water frontage presented a compact wall of\r\nrich and varied forest, resting on the surface of the stream. It seemed\r\nto form a finished border to the water scene, where the dome-like,\r\nrounded shapes of exogenous trees which constituted the mass formed the\r\ngroundwork, and the endless diversity of broad-leaved Heliconiæ and\r\nPalms—each kind differing in stem, crown, and fronds—the rich\r\nembroidery. The morning was calm and cloudless; and the slanting beams\r\nof the early sun, striking full on the front of the forest, lighted up\r\nthe whole most gloriously. The only sound of life which reached us was\r\nthe call of the Serracúra (Gallinula Cayennensis), a kind of wild-fowl;\r\nall else was so still that the voices of boatmen could be plainly heard\r\nfrom canoes passing a mile or two distant from us. The sun soon gains\r\ngreat power on the water, but with it the sea-breeze increases in\r\nstrength, moderating the heat which would otherwise be almost\r\ninsupportable. We reached the end of the Goajará about midday, and then\r\nentered the narrower channel of the Mojú. Up this we travelled, partly\r\nrowing and partly sailing between the same unbroken walls of forest,\r\nuntil the morning of the 28th.\r\n\r\n_August 29th._—The Mojú, a stream slightly inferior to the Thames in\r\nsize, is connected about twenty miles from its mouth by means of a\r\nshort, artificial canal with a small stream, the Igarapé-mirim, which\r\nflows the opposite way into the water-system of the Tocantins. Small\r\nvessels like ours take this route in preference to the stormy passage\r\nby way of the main river, although the distance is considerably\r\ngreater. We passed through the canal yesterday, and today have been\r\nthreading our way through a labyrinth of narrow channels, their banks\r\nall clothed with the same magnificent forest, but agreeably varied by\r\nhouses of planters and settlers. We passed many quite large\r\nestablishments, besides one pretty little village called Santa Anna.\r\nAll these channels are washed through by the tides—the ebb, contrary to\r\nwhat takes place in the short canal, setting towards the Tocantins. The\r\nwater is almost tepid (77° Fahr.), and the rank vegetation all around\r\nseems reeking with moisture. The country however, as we were told, is\r\nperfectly healthy. Some of the houses are built on wooden piles driven\r\ninto the mud of the swamp.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we reached the end of the last channel, called the\r\nMurutipucú, which runs for several miles between two unbroken lines of\r\nfan-leaved palms, forming colossal palisades with their straight stems.\r\nOn rounding a point of land, we came in full view of the Tocantins. The\r\nevent was announced by one of our Indians, who was on the lookout at\r\nthe prow, shouting: “La está o Paraná-uassú!” “Behold, the great\r\nriver!” It was a grand sight—a broad expanse of dark waters dancing\r\nmerrily to the breeze; the opposite shore, a narrow blue line, miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWe went ashore on an island covered with palm-trees, to make a fire and\r\nboil our kettle for tea. I wandered a short way inland, and was\r\nastounded at the prospect. The land lay below the upper level of the\r\ndaily tides, so that there was no underwood, and the ground was bare.\r\nThe trees were almost all of one species of Palm, the gigantic\r\nfan-leaved Mauritia flexuosa; only on the borders was there a small\r\nnumber of a second kind, the equally remarkable Ubussú palm, Manicaria\r\nsaccifera. The Ubussú has erect, uncut leaves, twenty-five feet long,\r\nand six feet wide, all arranged round the top of a four-foot high stem,\r\nso as to form a figure like that of a colossal shuttlecock. The\r\nfan-leaved palms, which clothed nearly the entire islet, had huge\r\ncylindrical smooth stems, three feet in diameter, and about a hundred\r\nfeet high. The crowns were formed of enormous clusters of fan-shaped\r\nleaves, the stalks alone of which measured seven to ten feet in length.\r\nNothing in the vegetable world could be more imposing than this grove\r\nof palms. There was no underwood to obstruct the view of the long\r\nperspective of towering columns. The crowns, which were densely packed\r\ntogether at an immense height overhead, shut out the rays of the sun;\r\nand the gloomy solitude beneath, through which the sound of our voices\r\nseemed to reverberate, could be compared to nothing so well as a solemn\r\ntemple. The fruits of the two palms were scattered over the ground;\r\nthose of the Ubussu adhere together by twos and threes, and have a\r\nrough, brown-coloured shell; the fruit of the Mauritia, on the\r\ncontrary, is of a bright red hue, and the skin is impressed with\r\ndeep-crossing lines, which give it a resemblance to a quilted\r\ncricket-ball.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, the tide being favourable and the breeze strong, we\r\ncrossed the river, taking it in a slanting direction, a distance of\r\nsixteen miles, and arrived at eight o’clock the following morning at\r\nCametá. This is a town of some importance, pleasantly situated on the\r\nsomewhat high terra firma of the left bank of the Tocantins. I will\r\ndefer giving an account of the place till the end of this narrative of\r\nour Tocantins voyage. We lost here another of our men, who got drinking\r\nwith some old companions ashore, and were obliged to start on the\r\ndifficult journey up the river with two hands only, and they in a very\r\ndissatisfied humour with the prospect.\r\n\r\nThe river view from Cametá is magnificent. The town is situated, as\r\nalready mentioned, on a high bank, which forms quite a considerable\r\nelevation for this flat country, and the broad expanse of dark-green\r\nwaters is studded with low, palm-clad islands, the prospect down river,\r\nhowever, being clear, or bounded only by a sea-like horizon of water\r\nand sky. The shores are washed by the breeze-tossed waters into little\r\nbays and creeks, fringed with sandy beaches. The Tocantins has been\r\nlikened, by Prince Adalbert of Prussia, who crossed its mouth in 1846,\r\nto the Ganges. It is upwards of ten miles in breadth at its mouth;\r\nopposite Cametá it is five miles broad. Mr. Burchell, the well-known\r\nEnglish traveller, descended the river from the mining provinces of\r\ninterior Brazil some years before our visit. Unfortunately, the utility\r\nof this fine stream is impaired by the numerous obstructions to its\r\nnavigation in the shape of cataracts and rapids, which commence, in\r\nascending, at about 120 miles above Cametá, as will be seen in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n_August 30th._—Arrived, in company with Senhor Laroque, an intelligent\r\nPortuguese merchant, at Vista Alegre, fifteen miles above Cametá. This\r\nwas the residence of Senhor Antonio Ferreira Gomez, and was a fair\r\nsample of a Brazilian planter’s establishment in this part of the\r\ncountry. The buildings covered a wide space, the dwelling-house being\r\nseParáted from the place of business, and as both were built on low,\r\nflooded ground, the communication between the two was by means of a\r\nlong wooden bridge. From the office and visitors’ apartments a wooden\r\npier extended into the river. The whole was raised on piles above the\r\nhigh-water mark. There was a rude mill for grinding sugar-cane, worked\r\nby bullocks; but cashaça, or rum, was the only article manufactured\r\nfrom the juice. Behind the buildings was a small piece of ground\r\ncleared from the forest, and planted with fruit trees, orange, lemon,\r\ngenipapa, goyava, and others; and beyond this, a broad path through a\r\nneglected plantation of coffee and cacao, led to several large sheds,\r\nwhere the farinha, or mandioca meal, was manufactured. The plantations\r\nof mandioca are always scattered about in the forest, some of them\r\nbeing on islands in the middle of the river. Land being plentiful, and\r\nthe plough, as well as, indeed, nearly all other agricultural\r\nimplements, unknown, the same ground is not planted three years\r\ntogether; but a new piece of forest is cleared every alternate year,\r\nand the old clearing suffered to relapse into jungle.\r\n\r\nWe stayed here two days, sleeping ashore in the apartment devoted to\r\nstrangers. As usual in Brazilian houses of the middle class, we were\r\nnot introduced to the female members of the family, and, indeed, saw\r\nnothing of them except at a distance. In the forest and thickets about\r\nthe place we were tolerably successful in collecting, finding a number\r\nof birds and insects which do not occur at Pará. I saw here, for the\r\nfirst time, the sky-blue Chatterer (Ampelis cotinga). It was on the\r\ntopmost bough of a very lofty tree, and completely out of the reach of\r\nan ordinary fowling-piece. The beautiful light-blue colour of its\r\nplumage was plainly discernible at that distance. It is a dull, quiet\r\nbird. A much commoner species was the Cigana or Gipsy (Opisthocomus\r\ncristatus), a bird belonging to the same order (Gallinacea) as our\r\ndomestic fowl. It is about the size of a pheasant; the plumage is dark\r\nbrown, varied with reddish, and the head is adorned with a crest of\r\nlong feathers. It is a remarkable bird in many respects. The hind toe\r\nis not placed high above the level of the other toes, as it is in the\r\nfowl order generally, but lies on the same plane with them; the shape\r\nof the foot becomes thus suited to the purely arboreal habits of the\r\nbird, enabling it to grasp firmly the branches of trees. This is a\r\ndistinguishing character of all the birds in equinoctial America which\r\nrepresents the fowl and pheasant tribes of the old world, and affords\r\nanother proof of the adaptation of the fauna to a forest region. The\r\nCigana lives in considerable flocks on the lower trees and bushes\r\nbordering the streams and lagoons, and feeds on various wild fruits,\r\nespecially the sour Goyava (Psidium sp.). The natives say it devours\r\nthe fruit of arborescent Arums (Caladium arborescens), which grow in\r\ncrowded masses around the swampy banks of lagoons. Its voice is a\r\nharsh, grating hiss; it makes the noise when alarmed or when disturbed\r\nby passing canoes, all the individuals sibilating as they fly heavily\r\naway from tree to tree. It is polygamous, like other members of the\r\nsame order. It is never, however, by any chance, seen on the ground,\r\nand is nowhere domesticated. The flesh has an unpleasant odour of musk\r\ncombined with wet hides—a smell called by the Brazilians catinga; it\r\nis, therefore, uneatable. If it be as unpalatable to carnivorous\r\nanimals as it is to man, the immunity from persecution which it would\r\nthereby enjoy would account for its existing in such great numbers\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nWe lost another of our crew here; and thus, at the commencement of our\r\nvoyage, had before us the prospect of being forced to return, from\r\nsheer want of hands, to manage the canoe. Senhor Gomez, to whom we had\r\nbrought letters of introduction from Senhor Joao Augusto Correia, a\r\nBrazilian gentlemen of high standing at Pará, tried what he could do to\r\ninduce the canoe-men of his neighbourhood to engage with us, but it was\r\na vain endeavour. The people of these parts seemed to be above working\r\nfor wages. They are naturally indolent, and besides, have all some\r\nlittle business or plantation of their own, which gives them a\r\nlivelihood with independence. It is difficult to obtain hands under any\r\ncircumstances, but it was particularly so in our case, from being\r\nforeigners, and suspected, as was natural amongst ignorant people, of\r\nbeing strange in our habits. At length, our host lent us two of his\r\nslaves to help us on another stage, namely, to the village of Baiao,\r\nwhere we had great hopes of having this, our urgent want, supplied by\r\nthe military commandant of the district.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssai Palm (Euterpe oleracea).\r\n\r\n_September 2nd._—The distance from Vista Alegre to Baiao is about\r\ntwenty-five miles. We had but little wind, and our men were therefore\r\nobliged to row the greater part of the way. The oars used in such\r\ncanoes as ours are made by tying a stout paddle to the end of a long\r\npole by means of woody lianas. The men take their stand on a raised\r\ndeck, formed by a few rough planks placed over the arched covering in\r\nthe fore part of the vessel, and pull with their backs to the stern. We\r\nstarted at six a.m., and about sunset reached a point where the west\r\nchannel of the river, along which we had been travelling since we left\r\nCametá, joined a broader middle one, and formed with it a great expanse\r\nof water. The islands here seem to form two pretty regular lines,\r\ndividing the great river into three channels. As we progressed slowly,\r\nwe took the montaria, and went ashore, from time to time, to the\r\nhouses, which were numerous on the river banks as well as on the larger\r\nislands. In low situations they had a very unfinished appearance, being\r\nmere frameworks raised high on wooden piles, and thatched with the\r\nleaves of the Ubussú palm. In their construction another palm tree is\r\nmade much use of, viz., the Assai (Euterpe oleracea). The outer part of\r\nthe stem of this species is hard and tough as horn; it is split into\r\nnarrow planks, and these form a great portion of the walls and\r\nflooring. The residents told us that the western channel becomes nearly\r\ndry in the middle of the fine season, but that at high water, in April\r\nand May, the river rises to the level of the house floors. The river\r\nbottom is everywhere sandy, and the country perfectly healthy. The\r\npeople seemed to all be contented and happy, but idleness and poverty\r\nwere exhibited by many unmistakeable signs. As to the flooding of their\r\nisland abodes, they did not seem to care about that at all. They seem\r\nto be almost amphibious, or as much at home on the water as on land. It\r\nwas really quite alarming to see men and women and children, in little\r\nleaky canoes laden to the water-level with bag and baggage, crossing\r\nbroad reaches of river. Most of them have houses also on the terra\r\nfirma, and reside in the cool palm swamps of the Ygapó islands, as they\r\nare called, only in the hot and dry season. They live chiefly on fish,\r\nshellfish (amongst which were large Ampullariæ, whose flesh I found, on\r\ntrial, to be a very tough morsel), the never failing farinha, and the\r\nfruits of the forest. Amongst the latter, the fruits of palm trees\r\noccupied the chief place. The Assai is the most in use, but this forms\r\na universal article of diet in all parts of the country. The fruit,\r\nwhich is perfectly round, and about the size of a cherry, contains but\r\na small portion of pulp lying between the skin and the hard kernel.\r\nThis is made, with the addition of water, into a thick, violet-coloured\r\nbeverage, which stains the lips like blackberries. The fruit of the\r\nMirití is also a common article of food, although the pulp is sour and\r\nunpalatable, at least to European tastes. It is boiled, and then eaten\r\nwith farinha. The Tucumá (Astrocaryum tucuma), and the Mucujá\r\n(Acrocomia lasiospatha), grow only on the mainland. Their fruits yield\r\na yellowish, fibrous pulp, which the natives eat in the same way as the\r\nMirití. They contain so much fatty matter, that vultures and dogs\r\ndevour them greedily.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of September 3rd we reached the right or eastern\r\nbank, which is forty to sixty feet high at this point. The houses were\r\nmore substantially built than those we had hitherto seen. We succeeded\r\nin buying a small turtle; most of the inhabitants had a few of these\r\nanimals, which they kept in little enclosures made with stakes. The\r\npeople were of the same class everywhere, Mamelucos. They were very\r\ncivil; we were not able, however, to purchase much fresh food from\r\nthem. I think this was owing to their really not having more than was\r\nabsolutely required to satisfy their own needs. In these districts,\r\nwhere the people depend solely on fishing for animal food, there is a\r\nperiod of the year when they suffer hunger, so that they are disposed\r\nto highly prize a small stock when they have it. They generally\r\nanswered in the negative when we asked, money in hand, whether they had\r\nfowls, turtles, or eggs to sell. “Nao ha, sinto que nao posso lhe ser\r\nbom;” or, “Nao ha, men coracao.” “We have none; I am sorry I cannot\r\noblige you;” or, “There is none, my heart.”\r\n\r\n_Sept. 3rd to 7th._—At half-past eight a.m. we arrived at Baiao, which\r\nis built on a very high bank, and contains about 400 inhabitants. We\r\nhad to climb to the village up a ladder, which is fixed against the\r\nbank, and, on arriving at the top, took possession of a room, which\r\nSenhor Seixas had given orders to be prepared for us. He himself was\r\naway at his sitio, and would not be here until the next day. We were\r\nnow quite dependent upon him for men to enable us to continue our\r\nvoyage, and so had no remedy but to wait his leisure. The situation of\r\nthe place, and the nature of the woods around it, promised well for\r\nnovelties in birds and insects; so we had no reason to be vexed at the\r\ndelay, but brought our apparatus and store-boxes up from the canoe, and\r\nset to work.\r\n\r\nThe easy, lounging life of the people amused us very much. I afterwards\r\nhad plenty of time to become used to tropical village life. There is a\r\nfree, familiar, pro bono publico style of living in these small places,\r\nwhich requires some time for a European to fall into. No sooner were we\r\nestablished in our rooms, than a number of lazy young fellows came to\r\nlook on and make remarks, and we had to answer all sorts of questions.\r\nThe houses have their doors and windows open to the street, and people\r\nwalk in and out as they please; there is always, however, a more\r\nsecluded apartment, where the female members of the families reside. In\r\ntheir familiarity there is nothing intentionally offensive, and it is\r\npractised simply in the desire to be civil and sociable. A young\r\nMameluco, named Soares, an Escrivao, or public clerk, took me into his\r\nhouse to show me his library. I was rather surprised to see a number of\r\nwell-thumbed Latin classics: Virgil, Terence, Cicero’s Epistles, and\r\nLivy. I was not familiar enough, at this early period of my residence\r\nin the country, with Portuguese to converse freely with Senhor Soares,\r\nor ascertain what use he made of these books; it was an unexpected\r\nsight, a classical library in a mud-plastered and palm-thatched hut on\r\nthe banks of the Tocantins.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from the village was magnificent, over the green wooded\r\nislands, far away to the grey line of forest on the opposite shore of\r\nthe Tocantins. We were now well out of the low alluvial country of the\r\nAmazons proper, and the climate was evidently much drier than it is\r\nnear Pará. They had had no rain here for many weeks, and the atmosphere\r\nwas hazy around the horizon; so much so that the sun, before setting,\r\nglared like a blood-red globe. At Pará this never happens; the stars\r\nand sun are as clear and sharply defined when they peep above the\r\ndistant treetops as they are at the zenith. This beautiful transparency\r\nof the air arises, doubtless, from the equal distribution through it of\r\ninvisible vapour. I shall ever remember, in one of my voyages along the\r\nPará river, the grand spectacle that was once presented at sunrise. Our\r\nvessel was a large schooner, and we were bounding along before a\r\nspanking breeze, which tossed the waters into foam as the day dawned.\r\nSo clear was the air, that the lower rim of the full moon remained\r\nsharply defined until it touched the western horizon, whilst at the\r\nsame time, the sun rose in the east. The two great orbs were visible at\r\nthe same time, and the passage from the moonlit night to day was so\r\ngentle that it seemed to be only the brightening of dull weather. The\r\nwoods around Baiao were of second growth, the ground having been\r\nformerly cultivated. A great number of coffee and cotton trees grew\r\namongst the thickets. A fine woodland pathway extends for miles over\r\nthe high, undulating bank, leading from one house to another along the\r\nedge of the cliff. I went into several of them, and talked to their\r\ninmates. They were all poor people. The men were out fishing, some far\r\naway, a distance of many days journey; the women plant mandioca, make\r\nthe farinha, spin and weave cotton, manufacture soap of burnt cacao\r\nshells and andiroba oil, and follow various other domestic employments.\r\nI asked why they allowed their plantations to run to waste. They said\r\nthat it was useless trying to plant anything hereabout; the Sauba ant\r\ndevoured the young coffee trees, and everyone who attempted to contend\r\nagainst this universal ravager was sure to be defeated. The country,\r\nfor many miles along the banks of the river, seemed to be well peopled.\r\nThe inhabitants were nearly all of the tawny-white Mameluco class. I\r\nsaw a good many mulattos, but very few negroes and Indians, and none\r\nthat could be called pure whites.\r\n\r\nWhen Senhor Seixas arrived, he acted very kindly. He provided us at\r\nonce with two men, killed an ox in our honour, and treated us\r\naltogether with great consideration. We were not, however, introduced\r\nto his family. I caught a glimpse once of his wife, a pretty little\r\nMameluco woman, as she was tripping with a young girl, whom I supposed\r\nto be her daughter, across the backyard. Both wore long dressing-gowns\r\nmade of bright-coloured calico print, and had long wooden tobacco-pipes\r\nin their mouths. The room in which we slept and worked had formerly\r\nserved as a storeroom for cacao, and at night I was kept awake for\r\nhours by rats and cockroaches, which swarm in all such places. The\r\nlatter were running about all over the walls; now and then one would\r\ncome suddenly with a whirr full at my face, and get under my shirt if I\r\nattempted to jerk it off. As to the rats, they were chasing one another\r\nby the dozens all night long over the floor, up and down the edges of\r\nthe doors, and along the rafters of the open roof.\r\n\r\n_September 7th._—We started from Baiao at an early hour. One of our new\r\nmen was a good-humoured, willing young mulatto named José; the other\r\nwas a sulky Indian called Manoel, who seemed to have been pressed into\r\nour service against his will. Senhor Seixas, on parting, sent a\r\nquantity of fresh provisions on board. A few miles above Baiao the\r\nchannel became very shallow; we ran aground several times, and the men\r\nhad to disembark and shove the vessel off. Alexandro shot several fine\r\nfish here, with bow and arrow. It was the first time I had seen fish\r\ncaptured in this way. The arrow is a reed, with a steel barbed point,\r\nwhich is fixed in a hole at the end, and secured by fine twine made\r\nfrom the fibres of pineapple leaves. It is only in the clearest water\r\nthat fish can be thus shot: and the only skill required is to make, in\r\ntaking aim, the proper allowance for refraction.\r\n\r\nThe next day before sunrise a fine breeze sprang up, and the men awoke\r\nand set the sails. We glided all day through channels between islands\r\nwith long, white, sandy beaches, over which, now and then, aquatic and\r\nwading birds were seen running. The forest was low, and had a harsh,\r\ndry aspect. Several palm trees grew here which we had not before seen.\r\nOn low bushes, near the water, pretty, red-headed tanagers (Tanagra\r\ngularis) were numerous, flitting about and chirping like sparrows.\r\nAbout half-past four p.m., we brought to at the mouth of a creek or\r\nchannel, where there was a great extent of sandy beach. The sand had\r\nbeen blown by the wind into ridges and undulations, and over the more\r\nmoist parts, large flocks of sandpipers were running about. Alexandro\r\nand I had a long ramble over the rolling plain, which came as an\r\nagreeable change after the monotonous forest scenery amid which we had\r\nbeen so long travelling. He pointed out to me the tracks of a huge\r\njaguar on the sand. We found here, also, our first turtle’s nest, and\r\nobtained 120 eggs from it, which were laid at a depth of nearly two\r\nfeet from the surface, the mother first excavating a hole, and\r\nafterwards covering it up with sand. The place is discoverable only by\r\nfollowing the tracks of the turtle from the water. I saw here an\r\nalligator for the first time, which reared its head and shoulders above\r\nthe water just after I had taken a bath near the spot. The night was\r\ncalm and cloudless, and we employed the hours before bedtime in angling\r\nby moonlight.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, we reached a small settlement called Patos, consisting of\r\nabout a dozen houses, and built on a high, rocky bank, on the eastern\r\nshore. The rock is the same nodular conglomerate which is found at so\r\nmany places, from the seacoast to a distance of 600 miles up the\r\nAmazons. Mr. Leavens made a last attempt here to engage men to\r\naccompany us to the Araguaya, but it was in vain; not a soul could be\r\ninduced by any amount of wages to go on such an expedition. The reports\r\nas to the existence of cedar were very vague. All said that the tree\r\nwas plentiful somewhere, but no one could fix on the precise locality.\r\nI believe that the cedar grows, like all other forest trees, in a\r\nscattered way, and not in masses anywhere. The fact of its being the\r\nprincipal tree observed floating down with the current of the Amazons\r\nis to be explained by its wood being much lighter than that of the\r\nmajority of trees. When the banks are washed away by currents, trees of\r\nall species fall into the river; but the heavier ones, which are the\r\nmost numerous, sink, and the lighter, such as the cedar, alone float\r\ndown to the sea.\r\n\r\nMr. Leavens was told that there were cedar trees at Trocará, on the\r\nopposite side of the river, near some fine rounded hills covered with\r\nforest, visible from Patos; so there we went. We found here several\r\nfamilies encamped in a delightful spot. The shore sloped gradually down\r\nto the water, and was shaded by a few wide-spreading trees. There was\r\nno underwood. A great number of hammocks were seen slung between the\r\ntree trunks, and the litter of a numerous household lay scattered\r\nabout. Women, old and young, some of the latter very good-looking, and\r\na large number of children, besides pet animals, enlivened the\r\nencampment. They were all half-breeds, simple, well-disposed people,\r\nand explained to us that they were inhabitants of Cametá, who had come\r\nthus far, eighty miles, to spend the summer months. The only motive\r\nthey could give for coming was that: “it was so hot in the town in the\r\nverao (summer), and they were all so fond of fresh fish.” Thus, these\r\nsimple folks think nothing of leaving home and business to come on a\r\nthree months’ picnic. It is the annual custom of this class of people\r\nthroughout the province to spend a few months of the fine season in the\r\nwilder parts of the country. They carry with them all the farinha they\r\ncan scrape together, this being the only article of food necessary to\r\nprovide. The men hunt and fish for the day’s wants, and sometimes\r\ncollect a little India-rubber, salsaparilla, or copaiba oil, to sell to\r\ntraders on their return; the women assist in paddling the canoes, do\r\nthe cooking, and sometimes fish with rod and line. The weather is\r\nenjoyable the whole time, and so days and weeks pass happily away.\r\n\r\nOne of the men volunteered to walk with us into the forest, and show us\r\na few cedar trees. We passed through a mile or two of spiny thickets,\r\nand at length came upon the banks of the rivulet Trocará, which flows\r\nover a stony bed, and, about a mile above its mouth, falls over a ledge\r\nof rocks, thus forming a very pretty cascade. In the neighbourhood, we\r\nfound a number of specimens of a curious land-shell, a large flat\r\nHelix, with a labyrinthine mouth (Anastoma). We learned afterwards that\r\nit was a species which had been discovered a few years previously by\r\nDr. Gardner, the botanist, on the upper part of the Tocantins.\r\n\r\nWe saw here, for the first time, the splendid Hyacinthine macaw\r\n(Macrocercus hyacinthinus, Lath., the Araruna of the natives), one of\r\nthe finest and rarest species of the Parrot family. It only occurs in\r\nthe interior of Brazil, from 16° S. lat. to the southern border of the\r\nAmazons valley. It is three feet long from the beak to the tip of the\r\ntail, and is entirely of a soft hyacinthine blue colour, except round\r\nthe eyes, where the skin is naked and white. It flies in pairs, and\r\nfeeds on the hard nuts of several palms, but especially of the Mucujá\r\n(Acrocomia lasiospatha). These nuts, which are so hard as to be\r\ndifficult to break with a heavy hammer, are crushed to a pulp by the\r\npowerful beak of this macaw.\r\n\r\nMr. Leavens was thoroughly disgusted with the people of Patos. Two men\r\nhad come from below with the intention, I believe, of engaging with us,\r\nbut they now declined. The inspector, constable, or governor of the\r\nplace appeared to be a very slippery customer, and I fancy discouraged\r\nthe men from going, whilst making a great show of forwarding our views.\r\nThese outlying settlements are the resort of a number of idle,\r\nworthless characters. There was a kind of festival going on, and the\r\npeople fuddled themselves with cashiri, an intoxicating drink invented\r\nby the Indians. It is made by soaking mandioca cakes in water until\r\nfermentation takes place, and tastes like new beer.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to obtain men, Mr. Leavens now gave up his project of\r\nascending the river as far as the Araguaya. He assented to our request,\r\nhowever, to ascend to the cataracts near Arroyos. We started,\r\ntherefore, from Patos with a more definite aim before us than we had\r\nhitherto. The river became more picturesque as we advanced. The water\r\nwas very low, it being now the height of the dry reason; the islands\r\nwere smaller than those further down, and some of them were high and\r\nrocky. Bold wooded bluffs projected into the stream, and all the shores\r\nwere fringed with beaches of glistening white sand. On one side of the\r\nriver there was an extensive grassy plain or campo with isolated\r\npatches of trees scattered over it. On the 14th and following day we\r\nstopped several times to ramble ashore. Our longest excursion was to a\r\nlarge shallow lagoon, choked up with aquatic plants, which lay about\r\ntwo miles across the campo. At a place called Juquerapuá, we engaged a\r\npilot to conduct us to Arroyos, and a few miles above the pilot’s\r\nhouse, arrived at a point where it was not possible to advance further\r\nin our large canoe on account of the rapids.\r\n\r\n_September 16th._—Embarked at six a.m. in a large montaria which had\r\nbeen lent to us for this part of our voyage by Senhor Seixas, leaving\r\nthe vigilinga anchored close to a rocky islet, named Santa Anna, to\r\nawait our return. Isidoro was left in charge, and we were sorry to be\r\nobliged to leave behind also our mulatto José, who had fallen ill since\r\nleaving Baiao. We had then remaining only Alexandro, Manoel, and the\r\npilot, a sturdy Tapuyo named Joaquim; scarcely a sufficient crew to\r\npaddle against the strong currents. At ten a.m. we arrived at the first\r\nrapids, which are called Tapaiunaquára. The river, which was here about\r\na mile wide, was choked up with rocks, a broken ridge passing\r\ncompletely across it. Between these confused piles of stone the\r\ncurrents were fearfully strong, and formed numerous eddies and\r\nwhirlpools. We were obliged to get out occasionally and walk from rock\r\nto rock, whilst the men dragged the canoe over the obstacles. Beyond\r\nTapaiunaquára, the stream became again broad and deep, and the river\r\nscenery was beautiful in the extreme. The water was clear and of a\r\nbluish-green colour. On both sides of the stream stretched ranges of\r\nwooded hills, and in the middle picturesque islets rested on the smooth\r\nwater, whose brilliant green woods fringed with palms formed charming\r\nbits of foreground to the perspective of sombre hills fading into grey\r\nin the distance. Joaquim pointed out to us grove after grove of Brazil\r\nnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) on the mainland. This is one of the\r\nchief collecting grounds for this nut. The tree is one of the loftiest\r\nin the forest, towering far above its fellows; we could see the woody\r\nfruits, large and round as cannon-balls, dotted over the branches. The\r\ncurrents were very strong in some places, so that during the greater\r\npart of the way the men preferred to travel near the shore, and propel\r\nthe boat by means of long poles.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Arroyos about four o’clock in the afternoon, after ten\r\nhours’ hard pull. The place consists simply of a few houses built on a\r\nhigh bank, and forms a station where canoemen from the mining countries\r\nof the interior of Brazil stop to rest themselves before or after\r\nsurmounting the dreaded falls and rapids of Guaribas, situated a couple\r\nof miles further up. We dined ashore, and in the evening again embarked\r\nto visit the falls. The vigorous and successful way in which our men\r\nbattled with the terrific currents excited our astonishment. The bed of\r\nthe river, here about a mile wide, is strewn with blocks of various\r\nsizes, which lie in the most irregular manner, and between them rush\r\ncurrents of more or less rapidity. With an accurate knowledge of the\r\nplace and skilful management, the falls can be approached in small\r\ncanoes by threading the less dangerous channels. The main fall is about\r\na quarter of a mile wide; we climbed to an elevation overlooking it,\r\nand had a good view of the cataract. A body of water rushes with\r\nterrific force down a steep slope, and boils up with deafening roar\r\naround the boulders which obstruct its course. The wildness of the\r\nwhole scene was very impressive. As far as the eye could see, stretched\r\nrange after range of wooded hills and scores of miles of beautiful\r\nwilderness, inhabited only by scanty tribes of wild Indians. In the\r\nmidst of such a solitude, the roar of the cataract seemed fitting\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n_September 17th._—We commenced early in the morning our downward\r\nvoyage. Arroyos is situated in about 4° 10′ S. lat.; and lies,\r\ntherefore, about 130 miles from the mouth of the Tocantins. Fifteen\r\nmiles above Guaribas, another similar cataract called Tabocas lies\r\nacross the river. We were told that there were in all fifteen of these\r\nobstructions to navigate, between Arroyos and the mouth of the\r\nAraguaya. The worst was the Inferno, the Guaribas standing second to it\r\nin evil reputation. Many canoes and lives have been lost here, most of\r\nthe accidents arising through the vessels being hurled against an\r\nenormous cubical mass of rock called the Guaribinha, which we, on our\r\ntrip to the falls in the small canoe, passed round with the greatest\r\nease about a quarter of a mile below the main falls. This, however, was\r\nthe dry season; in the time of full waters, a tremendous current sets\r\nagainst it. We descended the river rapidly, and found it excellent fun\r\nshooting the rapids. The men seemed to delight in choosing the swiftest\r\nparts of the current; they sang and yelled in the greatest excitement,\r\nworking the paddles with great force, and throwing clouds of spray\r\nabove us as we bounded downwards. We stopped to rest at the mouth of a\r\nrivulet named Caganxa. The pilot told us that gold had been found in\r\nthe bed of this brook; so we had the curiosity to wade several hundred\r\nyards through the icy cold waters in search of it. Mr. Leavens seemed\r\nvery much interested in the matter. He picked up all the shining stones\r\nhe could espy in the pebbly bottom, in hopes of finding diamonds also.\r\nThere is, in fact, no reason why both gold and diamonds should not be\r\nfound here, the hills being a continuation of those of the mining\r\ncountries of interior Brazil, and the brooks flowing through the narrow\r\nvalleys between them.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the place where we had left our canoe, we found poor\r\nJosé the mulatto much worse, so we hastened on to Juquerapuá to procure\r\naid. An old half-caste woman took charge of him; she made poultices of\r\nthe pulp of a wild fruit, administered cooling draughts made from herbs\r\nwhich grew near the house, and in fact, acted the part of nurse\r\nadmirably. We stayed at this place all night and part of the following\r\nday, and I had a stroll along a delightful pathway, which led over hill\r\nand dale, two or three miles through the forest. I was surprised at the\r\nnumber and variety of brilliantly-coloured butterflies; they were all\r\nof small size and started forth from the low bushes, which bordered the\r\nroad, at every step I took. I first heard here the notes of a trogon;\r\nit was seated alone on a branch, at no great elevation; a beautiful\r\nbird, with glossy-green back and rose-coloured breast (probably Trogon\r\nmelanurus). At intervals it uttered, in a complaining tone, a sound\r\nresembling the words “quá, quá.” It is a dull inactive bird, and not\r\nvery ready to take flight when approached. In this respect, however,\r\nthe trogons are not equal to the jacamars, whose stupidity in remaining\r\nat their posts, seated on low branches in the gloomiest shades of the\r\nforest, is somewhat remarkable in a country where all other birds are\r\nexceedingly wary. One species of jacamar was not uncommon here (Galbula\r\nviridis); I sometimes saw two or three together seated on a slender\r\nbranch, silent and motionless with the exception of a slight movement\r\nof the head; when an insect flew past within a short distance, one of\r\nthe birds would dart off, seize it, and return again to its\r\nsitting-place. The trogons are found in the tropics of both\r\nhemispheres. The jacamars, which are clothed in plumage of the most\r\nbeautiful golden-bronze and steel colours, are peculiar to tropical\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAt night I slept ashore as a change from the confinement of the canoe,\r\nhaving obtained permission from Senhor Joaquim to sling my hammock\r\nunder his roof. The house, like all others in these out-of-the-way\r\nparts of the country, was a large open, palm-thatched shed, having one\r\nend enclosed by means of partitions also made of palm-leaves, so as to\r\nform a private apartment. Under the shed were placed all the household\r\nutensils; earthenware jars, pots, and kettles, hunting and fishing\r\nimplements, paddles, bows and arrows, harpoons, and so forth. One or\r\ntwo common wooden chests serve to contain the holiday clothing of the\r\nfemales. There is no other furniture except a few stools and the\r\nhammock, which answers the purposes of chair and sofa. When a visitor\r\nenters, he is asked to sit down in a hammock; persons who are on\r\nintimate terms with each other recline together in the same hammock,\r\none at each end. This is a very convenient arrangement for friendly\r\nconversation. There are neither tables nor chairs; the cloth for meals\r\nis spread on a mat, and the guests squat round in any position they\r\nchoose. There is no cordiality of manners, but the treatment of the\r\nguests shows a keen sense of the duties of hospitality on the part of\r\nthe host. There is a good deal of formality in the intercourse of these\r\nhalf-wild mamelucos, which, I believe, has been chiefly derived from\r\ntheir Indian forefathers, although a little of it may have been copied\r\nfrom the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nA little distance from the house were the open sheds under which the\r\nfarinha for the use of the establishment was manufactured. In the\r\ncentre of each shed stood the shallow pans, made of clay and built over\r\novens, where the meal is roasted. A long flexible cylinder made of the\r\npeel of a marantaceous plant, plaited into the proper form, hung\r\nsuspended from a beam; it is in this that the pulp of the mandioca is\r\npressed, and from it the juice, which is of a highly poisonous nature,\r\nalthough the pulp is wholesome food, runs into pans placed beneath to\r\nreceive it. A wooden trough, such as is used in all these places for\r\nreceiving the pulp before the poisonous matter is extracted, stood on\r\nthe ground, and from the posts hung the long wicker-work baskets, or\r\naturas, in which the women carry the roots from the roça or clearing; a\r\nbroad ribbon made from the inner bark of the monguba tree is attached\r\nto the rims of the baskets, and is passed round the forehead of the\r\ncarriers, to relieve their backs in supporting the heavy load. Around\r\nthe shed were planted a number of banana and other fruit trees; amongst\r\nthem were the never-failing capsicum-pepper bushes, brilliant as\r\nholly-trees at Christmas time with their fiery-red fruit, and lemon\r\ntrees; the one supplying the pungent, the other the acid, for sauce to\r\nthe perpetual meal of fish. There is never in such places any\r\nappearance of careful cultivation—no garden or orchard. The useful\r\ntrees are surrounded by weeds and bushes, and close behind rises the\r\neverlasting forest.\r\n\r\nThere were other strangers under Senhor Joaquim’s roof besides\r\nmyself—mulattos, mamelucos, and Indian,—so we formed altogether a large\r\nparty. Houses occur at rare intervals in this wild country, and\r\nhospitality is freely given to the few passing travellers. After a\r\nfrugal supper, a large wood fire was lighted in the middle of the shed,\r\nand all turned in to their hammocks, and began to converse. A few of\r\nthe party soon dropped asleep; others, however, kept awake until a very\r\nlate hour telling stories. Some related adventures which had happened\r\nto them whilst hunting or fishing; others recounted myths about the\r\nCurupíra, and other demons or spirits of the forest. They were all very\r\nappropriate to the time and place, for now and then a yell or a shriek\r\nresounded through the gloomy wilderness around the shed. One old\r\nparchment-faced fellow, with a skin the colour of mahogany, seemed to\r\nbe a capital story-teller; but I was sorry I did not know enough of the\r\nlanguage to follow him in all the details which he gave. Amongst other\r\nthings, he related an adventure he had once had with a jaguar. He got\r\nup from his hammock in the course of the narrative to give it the\r\ngreater effect by means of gestures; he seized a bow and a large\r\ntaquará arrow to show how he slew the beast, imitated its hoarse growl,\r\nand danced about the fire like a demon.\r\n\r\nIn descending the river we landed frequently, and Mr. Wallace and I\r\nlost no chance of adding to our collections, so that before the end of\r\nour journey, we had got together a very considerable number of birds,\r\ninsects, and shells, chiefly taken, however, in the low country.\r\nLeaving Baiao, we took our last farewell of the limpid waters and\r\nvaried scenery of the upper river, and found ourselves again in the\r\nhumid flat region of the Amazons valley. We sailed down this lower part\r\nof the river by a different channel from the one we travelled along in\r\nascending, and frequently went ashore on the low islands in mid-river.\r\nAs already stated, these are covered with water in the wet season; but\r\nat this time, there having been three months of fine weather, they were\r\ndry throughout, and by the subsidence of the waters, placed four or\r\nfive feet above the level of the river. They are covered with a most\r\nluxuriant forest, comprising a large number of india-rubber trees. We\r\nfound several people encamped here, who were engaged in collecting and\r\npreparing the rubber, and thus had an opportunity of observing the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe tree which yields this valuable sap is the Siphonia elastica, a\r\nmember of the Euphorbiaceous order; it belongs, therefore, to a group\r\nof plants quite different from that which furnishes the caoutchouc of\r\nthe East Indies and Africa. This latter is the product of different\r\nspecies of Ficus, and is considered, I believe, in commerce, an\r\ninferior article to the India-rubber of Pará. The Siphonia elastica\r\ngrows only on the lowlands in the Amazons region; hitherto, the rubber\r\nhas been collected chiefly in the islands and swampy parts of the\r\nmainland within a distance of fifty to a hundred miles to the west of\r\nPará; but there are plenty of untapped trees still growing in the wilds\r\nof the Tapajos, Madeira, Juruá, and Jauarí, as far as 1800 miles from\r\nthe Atlantic coast. The tree is not remarkable in appearance; in bark\r\nand foliage it is not unlike the European ash. But the trunk, like that\r\nof all forest trees, shoots up to an immense height before throwing off\r\nbranches. The trees seem to be no man’s property hereabout. The people\r\nwe met with told us they came every year to collect rubber on these\r\nislands as soon as the waters had subsided, namely in August, and\r\nremained until January or February. The process is very simple. Every\r\nmorning each person, man or woman, to whom is allotted a certain number\r\nof trees, goes the round of the whole and collects in a large vessel\r\nthe milky sap which trickles from gashes made in the bark on the\r\npreceding evening, and which is received in little clay cups, or in\r\nampullaria shells stuck beneath the wounds. The sap, which at first is\r\nof the consistence of cream, soon thickens; the collectors are provided\r\nwith a great number of wooden moulds of the shape in which the rubber\r\nis wanted, and when they return to the camp, they dip them into the\r\nliquid, laying on, in the course of several days, one coat after\r\nanother. When this is done, the substance is white and hard; the proper\r\ncolour and consistency are given by passing it repeatedly through a\r\nthick black smoke obtained by burning the nuts of certain palm trees,\r\nafter which process the article is ready for sale. India-rubber is\r\nknown throughout the province only by the name of seringa, the\r\nPortuguese word for syringe; it owes this appellation to the\r\ncircumstance that it was only in this form that the first Portuguese\r\nsettlers noticed it to be employed by the aborigines. It is said that\r\nthe Indians were first taught to make syringes of rubber by seeing\r\nnatural tubes formed by it when the spontaneously-flowing sap gathered\r\nround projecting twigs. Brazilians of all classes still use it\r\nextensively in the form of syringes, for injections form a great\r\nfeature in the popular system of cures; the rubber for this purpose is\r\nmade into a pear- shaped bottle, and a quill fixed in the long neck.\r\n\r\n_September 24th._—Opposite Cametá, the islands are all planted with\r\ncacao, the tree which yields the chocolate nut. The forest is not\r\ncleared for the purpose, but the cacao plants are stuck in here and\r\nthere almost at random amongst the trees. There are many houses on the\r\nbanks of the river, all elevated above the swampy soil on wooden piles,\r\nand furnished with broad ladders by which to mount to the ground floor.\r\nAs we passed by in our canoe, we could see the people at their\r\noccupations in the open verandas, and in one place saw a ball going on\r\nin broad daylight; there were fiddles and guitars hard at work, and a\r\nnumber of lads in white shirts and trousers dancing with brown damsels\r\nclad in showy print dresses. The cacao tree produces a curious\r\nimpression on account of the flowers and fruit growing directly out of\r\nthe trunk and branches. There is a whole group of wild fruit trees\r\nwhich have the same habit in this country. In the wildernesses where\r\nthe cacao is planted, the collecting of the fruit is dangerous due to\r\nthe number of poisonous snakes which inhabit the places. One day, when\r\nwe were running our montaria to a landing-place, we saw a large serpent\r\non the trees overhead as we were about to brush past; the boat was\r\nstopped just in the nick of time, and Mr. Leavens brought the reptile\r\ndown with a charge of shot.\r\n\r\n_September 26th._—At length we got clear of the islands, and saw once\r\nmore before us the sea-like expanse of waters which forms the mouth of\r\nthe Tocantins. The river had now sunk to its lowest point, and numbers\r\nof fresh-water dolphins were rolling about in shoaly places. There are\r\nhere two species, one of which was new to science when I sent specimens\r\nto England; it is called the Tucuxí (Steno tucuxi of Gray). When it\r\ncomes to the surface to breathe, it rises horizontally, showing first\r\nits back fin, then draws an inspiration, and dives gently down, head\r\nforemost. This mode of proceeding distinguishes the Tucuxí at once from\r\nthe other species, which is called Bouto or porpoise by the natives\r\n(Inia Geoffroyi of Desmarest). When this rises the top of the head is\r\nthe part first seen; it then blows, and immediately afterwards dips\r\nhead downwards, its back curving over, exposing successively the whole\r\ndorsal ridge with its fin. It seems thus to pitch heels over head, but\r\ndoes not show the tail fin. Besides this peculiar motion, it is\r\ndistinguished from the Tucuxí by its habit of generally going in pairs.\r\nBoth species are exceedingly numerous throughout the Amazons and its\r\nlarger tributaries, but they are nowhere more plentiful than in the\r\nshoaly water at the mouth of the Tocantins, especially in the dry\r\nseason. In the Upper Amazons a third pale flesh-coloured species is\r\nalso abundant (the Delphinus pallidus of Gervais). With the exception\r\nof a species found in the Ganges, all other varieties of dolphin\r\ninhabit the sea exclusively. In the broader parts of the Amazons, from\r\nits mouth to a distance of fifteen hundred miles in the interior, one\r\nor other of the three kinds here mentioned are always heard rolling,\r\nblowing, and snorting, especially at night, and these noises contribute\r\nmuch to the impression of sea-wide vastness and desolation which haunts\r\nthe traveller. Besides dolphins in the water, frigate birds in the air\r\nare characteristic of this lower part of the Tocantins. Flocks of them\r\nwere seen the last two or three days of our journey, hovering above at\r\nan immense height. Towards night, we were obliged to cast anchor over a\r\nshoal in the middle of the river to await the ebb tide. The wind blew\r\nvery strongly, and this, together with the incoming flow, caused such a\r\nheavy sea that it was impossible to sleep. The vessel rolled and\r\npitched until every bone in our bodies ached with the bumps we\r\nreceived, and we were all more or less sea-sick. On the following day\r\nwe entered the Anapú, and on the 30th September, after threading again\r\nthe labyrinth of channels communicating between the Tocantins and the\r\nMoju, arrived at Pará.\r\n\r\nI will now give a short account of Cametá, the principal town on the\r\nbanks of the Tocantins, which I visited for the second time, in June,\r\n1849; Mr. Wallace, in the same month, departed from Pará to explore the\r\nrivers Guamá and Capim. I embarked as passenger in a Cametá trading\r\nvessel, the _St. John_, a small schooner of thirty tons burthen. I had\r\nlearnt by this time that the only way to attain the objects for which I\r\nhad come to this country was to accustom myself to the ways of life of\r\nthe humbler classes of the inhabitants. A traveller on the Amazons\r\ngains little by being furnished with letters of recommendation to\r\npersons of note, for in the great interior wildernesses of forest and\r\nriver the canoe-men have pretty much their own way; the authorities\r\ncannot force them to grant passages or to hire themselves to\r\ntravellers, and therefore, a stranger is obliged to ingratiate himself\r\nwith them in order to get conveyed from place to place. I thoroughly\r\nenjoyed the journey to Cametá; the weather was again beautiful in the\r\nextreme. We started from Pará at sunrise on the 8th of June, and on the\r\n10th emerged from the narrow channels of the Anapu into the broad\r\nTocantins. The vessel was so full of cargo that there was no room to\r\nsleep in the cabin; so we passed the nights on deck. The captain or\r\nsupercargo, called in Portuguese _cabo_, was a mameluco, named Manoel,\r\na quiet, good-humoured person, who treated me with the most unaffected\r\ncivility during the three days’ journey. The pilot was also a mameluco,\r\nnamed John Mendez, a handsome young fellow, full of life and spirit. He\r\nhad on board a wire guitar or viola, as it is here called; and in the\r\nbright moonlight nights, as we lay at anchor hour after hour waiting\r\nfor the tide, he enlivened us all with songs and music. He was on the\r\nbest of terms with the cabo, both sleeping in the same hammock slung\r\nbetween the masts. I passed the nights wrapped in an old sail outside\r\nthe roof of the cabin. The crew, five in number, were Indians and\r\nhalf-breeds, all of whom treated their two superiors with the most\r\namusing familiarity, yet I never sailed in a better managed vessel than\r\nthe _St. John._\r\n\r\nIn crossing to Cametá we had to await the flood-tide in a channel\r\ncalled Entre-as-Ilhas, which lies between two islands in mid- river,\r\nand John Mendez, being in good tune, gave us an extempore song,\r\nconsisting of a great number of verses. The crew lay about the deck\r\nlistening, and all joined in the chorus. Some stanzas related to me,\r\ntelling how I had come all the way from “Inglaterra,” to skin monkeys\r\nand birds and catch insects; the last-mentioned employment of course\r\ngiving ample scope for fun. He passed from this to the subject of\r\npolitical parties in Cametá; and then, as all the hearers were\r\nCametaenses and understood the hits, there were roars of laughter, some\r\nof them rolling over and over on the deck, so much were they tickled.\r\nParty spirit runs high at Cametá, not merely in connection with local\r\npolitics, but in relation to affairs of general concern, such as the\r\nelection of members to the Imperial Parliament, and so forth. This\r\npolitical strife is partly attributable to the circumstance that a\r\nnative of Cametá, Dr. Angelo Custodio Correia, had been in almost every\r\nelection, one of the candidates for the representation of the province.\r\nI fancied these shrewd but unsophisticated canoe-men saw through the\r\nabsurdities attending these local contests, and hence their inclination\r\nto satirise them; they were, however, evidently partisans of Dr.\r\nAngelo. The brother of Dr. Angelo, Joao Augusto Correia, a\r\ndistinguished merchant, was an active canvasser. The party of the\r\nCorreias was the Liberal, or, as it is called throughout Brazil, the\r\nSanta Luzia faction; the opposite side, at the head of which was one\r\nPedro Moraes, was the Conservative, or Saquarema party. I preserved one\r\nof the stanzas of the song, which, however, does not contain much\r\npoint; it ran thus:—\r\n\r\nOra paná, tana paná!, pana taná,\r\nJoao Augusto hé bonito e homem pimpao,\r\nMas Pedro hé feio e hum grande ladrao,\r\n(Chorus) Ora paná, etc.\r\n\r\nJohn Augustus is handsome and as a man ought to be,\r\nBut Peter is ugly and a great thief.\r\n(Chorus) Ora paná, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canoe-men of the Amazons have many songs and choruses, with which\r\nthey are in the habit of relieving the monotony of their slow voyages,\r\nand which are known all over the interior. The choruses consist of a\r\nsimple strain, repeated almost to weariness, and sung generally in\r\nunison, but sometimes with an attempt at harmony. There is a wildness\r\nand sadness about the tunes which harmonise well with, and in fact are\r\nborn of, the circumstances of the canoe-man’s life: the echoing\r\nchannels, the endless gloomy forests, the solemn nights, and the\r\ndesolate scenes of broad and stormy waters and falling banks. Whether\r\nthey were invented by the Indians or introduced by the Portuguese it is\r\nhard to decide, as many of the customs of the lower classes of\r\nPortuguese are so similar to those of the Indians that they have become\r\nblended with them. One of the commonest songs is very wild and pretty.\r\nIt has for refrain the words “Mai, Mai” (“Mother, Mother”), with a long\r\ndrawl on the second word. The stanzas are quite variable; the best wit\r\non board starts the verse, improvising as he goes on, and the others\r\njoin in the chorus. They all relate to the lonely river life and the\r\nevents of the voyage—the shoals, the wind, how far they shall go before\r\nthey stop to sleep, and so forth. The sonorous native names of places,\r\nGoajará, Tucumandúba, etc., add greatly to the charm of the wild music.\r\nSometimes they bring in the stars thus:—\r\n\r\nA lua está sahindo,\r\nMai, Mai!\r\nA lua está sahindo,\r\nMai, Mai!\r\nAs sete estrellas estao chorando,\r\nMai, Mai!\r\nPor s’acharem desamparados,\r\nMai, Mai!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon is rising,\r\nMother, Mother!\r\nThe moon is rising,\r\nMother, Mother!\r\nThe seven stars (Pleiades) are weeping,\r\nMother, Mother!\r\nTo find themselves forsaken,\r\nMother, mother!\r\n\r\n\r\nI fell asleep about ten o’clock, but at four in the morning John Mendez\r\nwoke me to enjoy the sight of the little schooner tearing through the\r\nwaves before a spanking breeze. The night was transparently clear and\r\nalmost cold, the moon appeared sharply defined against the dark blue\r\nsky, and a ridge of foam marked where the prow of the vessel was\r\ncleaving its way through the water. The men had made a fire in the\r\ngalley to make tea of an acid herb, called _erva cidreira_, a quantity\r\nof which they had gathered at the last landing-place, and the flames\r\nsparkled cheerily upwards. It is at such times as these that Amazon\r\ntravelling is enjoyable, and one no longer wonders at the love which\r\nmany, both natives and strangers, have for this wandering life. The\r\nlittle schooner sped rapidly on with booms bent and sails stretched to\r\nthe utmost; just as day dawned, we ran with scarcely slackened speed\r\ninto the port of Cameta, and cast anchor.\r\n\r\nI stayed at Cametá until the 16th of July, and made a considerable\r\ncollection of the natural productions of the neighbourhood. The town in\r\n1849 was estimated to contain about 5000 inhabitants, but the municipal\r\ndistrict of which Cametá is the capital numbered 20,000; this, however,\r\ncomprised the whole of the lower part of the Tocantins, which is the\r\nmost thickly populated part of the province of Pará. The productions of\r\nthe district are cacao, india-rubber, and Brazil nuts. The most\r\nremarkable feature in the social aspect of the place is the hybrid\r\nnature of the whole population, the amalgamation of the white and\r\nIndian races being here complete. The aborigines were originally very\r\nnumerous on the western bank of the Tocantins, the principal tribe\r\nhaving been the Camútas, from which the city takes its name. They were\r\na superior nation, settled, and attached to agriculture, and received\r\nwith open arms the white immigrants who were attracted to the district\r\nby its fertility, natural beauty, and the healthfulness of the climate.\r\nThe Portuguese settlers were nearly all males, the Indian women were\r\ngood-looking, and made excellent wives; so the natural result has been,\r\nin the course of two centuries, a complete blending of the two races.\r\nThere is now, however, a considerable infusion of negro blood in the\r\nmixture, several hundred African slaves having been introduced during\r\nthe last seventy years. The few whites are chiefly Portuguese, but\r\nthere are also two or three Brazilian families of pure European\r\ndescent. The town consists of three long streets, running parallel to\r\nthe river, with a few shorter ones crossing them at right angles. The\r\nhouses are very plain, being built, as usual in this country, simply of\r\na strong framework, filled up with mud, and coated with white plaster.\r\nA few of them are of two or three stories. There are three churches,\r\nand also a small theatre, where a company of native actors at the time\r\nof my visit were representing light Portuguese plays with considerable\r\ntaste and ability. The people have a reputation all over the province\r\nfor energy and perseverance; and it is often said that they are as keen\r\nin trade as the Portuguese. The lower classes are as indolent and\r\nsensual here as in other parts of the province, a moral condition not\r\nto be wondered at in a country where perpetual summer reigns, and where\r\nthe necessities of life are so easily obtained. But they are\r\nlight-hearted, quick-witted, communicative, and hospitable. I found\r\nhere a native poet, who had written some pretty verses, showing an\r\nappreciation of the natural beauties of the country, and was told that\r\nthe Archbishop of Bahia, the primate of Brazil, was a native of Cametá.\r\nIt is interesting to find the mamelucos displaying talent and\r\nenterprise, for it shows that degeneracy does not necessarily result\r\nfrom the mixture of white and Indian blood. The Cametaenses boast, as\r\nthey have a right to do, of theirs being the only large town which\r\nresisted successfully the anarchists in the great rebellion of 1835-6.\r\nWhilst the whites of Pará were submitting to the rule of half-savage\r\nrevolutionists, the mamelucos of Cametá placed themselves under the\r\nleadership of a courageous priest, named Prudencio; they armed\r\nthemselves, fortified the place, and repulsed the large forces which\r\nthe insurgents of Pará sent to attack the place. The town not only\r\nbecame the refuge for all loyal subjects, but was a centre whence large\r\nparties of volunteers sallied forth repeatedly to attack the anarchists\r\nin their various strongholds.\r\n\r\nThe forest behind Cametá is traversed by several broad roads, which\r\nlead over undulating ground many miles into the interior. They pass\r\ngenerally under shade, and part of the way through groves of coffee and\r\norange trees, fragrant plantations of cacao, and tracts of\r\nsecond-growth woods. The narrow brook-watered valleys, with which the\r\nland is intersected, alone have remained clothed with primæval forest,\r\nat least near the town. The houses along these beautiful roads belong\r\nchiefly to Mameluco, mulatto, and Indian families, each of which has\r\nits own small plantation. There are only a few planters with larger\r\nestablishments, and these have seldom more than a dozen slaves. Besides\r\nthe main roads, there are endless bye-paths which thread the forest and\r\ncommunicate with isolated houses. Along these the traveller may wander\r\nday after day without leaving the shade, and everywhere meet with\r\ncheerful, simple, and hospitable people.\r\n\r\nSoon after landing, I was introduced to the most distinguished citizen\r\nof the place, Dr. Angelo Custodio Correia, whom I have already\r\nmentioned. This excellent man was a favourable specimen of the highest\r\nclass of native Brazilians. He had been educated in Europe, was now a\r\nmember of the Brazilian Parliament, and had been twice president of his\r\nnative province. His manners were less formal, and his goodness more\r\nthoroughly genuine, perhaps, than is the rule generally with\r\nBrazilians. He was admired and loved, as I had ample opportunity of\r\nobserving, throughout all Amazonia. He sacrificed his life in 1855, for\r\nthe good of his fellow- townsmen, when Cameta was devastated by the\r\ncholera; having stayed behind with a few heroic spirits to succour\r\ninvalids and direct the burying of the dead, when nearly all the chief\r\ncitizens had fled from the place. After he had done what he could, he\r\nembarked for Pará but was himself then attacked with cholera, and died\r\non board the steamer before he reached the capital. Dr. Angelo received\r\nme with the usual kindness which he showed to all strangers. He\r\nprocured me, unsolicited, a charming country house, free of rent, hired\r\na mulatto servant for me, and thus relieved me of the many annoyances\r\nand delays attendant on a first arrival in a country town where even\r\nthe name of an inn is unknown. The rocinha, thus given up for my\r\nresidence, belonged to a friend of his, Senhor José Raimundo Furtado, a\r\nstout florid-complexioned gentleman, such a one as might be met with\r\nany day in a country town in England. To him also I was indebted for\r\nmany acts of kindness.\r\n\r\nThe rocinha was situated near a broad grassy road bordered by lofty\r\nwoods, which leads from Cametá to the Aldeia, a village two miles\r\ndistant. My first walks were along this road. From it branches another\r\nsimilar but still more picturesque road, which runs to Curimá and\r\nPacajá, two small settlements, several miles distant, in the heart of\r\nthe forest. The Curimá road is beautiful in the extreme. About half a\r\nmile from the house where I lived, it crosses a brook flowing through a\r\ndeep dell by means of a long rustic wooden bridge. The virgin forest is\r\nhere left untouched; numerous groups of slender palms, mingled with\r\nlofty trees overrun with creepers and Parásites, fill the shady glen\r\nand arch over the bridge, forming one of the most picturesque scenes\r\nimaginable. A little beyond the bridge there was an extensive grove of\r\norange and other trees, which yielded me a rich harvest. The Aldeia\r\nroad runs parallel to the river, the land from the border of the road\r\nto the indented shore of the Tocantins forming a long slope which was\r\nalso richly wooded; this slope was threaded by numerous shady paths,\r\nand abounded in beautiful insects and birds. At the opposite or\r\nsouthern end of the town, there was a broad road called the Estrada da\r\nVacaria; this ran along the banks of the Tocantins at some distance\r\nfrom the river, and continued over hill and dale, through bamboo\r\nthickets and palm swamps, for about fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nAt Cametá I chanced to verify a fact relating to the habits of a large\r\nhairy spider of the genus Mygale, in a manner worth recording. The\r\nspecies was M. avicularia, or one very closely allied to it; the\r\nindividual was nearly two inches in length of body, but the legs\r\nexpanded seven inches, and the entire body and legs were covered with\r\ncoarse grey and reddish hairs. I was attracted by a movement of the\r\nmonster on a tree-trunk; it was close beneath a deep crevice in the\r\ntree, across which was stretched a dense white web. The lower part of\r\nthe web was broken, and two small birds, finches, were entangled in the\r\npieces; they were about the size of the English siskin, and I judged\r\nthe two to be male and female. One of them was quite dead, the other\r\nlay under the body of the spider, not quite dead, and was smeared with\r\nthe filthy liquor or saliva exuded by the monster. I drove away the\r\nspider and took the birds, but the second one soon died. The fact of\r\nspecies of Mygale sallying forth at night, mounting trees, and sucking\r\nthe eggs and young of humming-birds, has been recorded long ago by\r\nMadame Merian and Palisot de Beauvois; but, in the absence of any\r\nconfirmation, it has come to be discredited. From the way the fact has\r\nbeen related, it would appear that it had been merely derived from the\r\nreport of natives, and had not been witnessed by the narrators. Count\r\nLangsdorff, in his _Expedition into the Interior of Brazil_, states\r\nthat he totally disbelieved the story. I found the circumstance to be\r\nquite a novelty to the residents hereabout. The Mygales are quite\r\ncommon insects: some species make their cells under stones, others form\r\nartistical tunnels in the earth, and some build their dens in the\r\nthatch of houses. The natives call them Aranhas carangueijeiras, or\r\ncrab-spiders. The hairs with which they are clothed come off when\r\ntouched, and cause a peculiar and almost maddening irritation. The\r\nfirst specimen that I killed and prepared was handled incautiously, and\r\nI suffered terribly for three days afterwards. I think this is not\r\nowing to any poisonous quality residing in the hairs, but to their\r\nbeing short and hard, and thus getting into the fine creases of the\r\nskin. Some Mygales are of immense size. One day I saw the children\r\nbelonging to an Indian family, who collected for me with one of these\r\nmonsters secured by a cord round its waist, by which they were leading\r\nit about the house as they would a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nBird-killing spider (Mygale avicularia) attacking finches.\r\n\r\nThe only monkeys I observed at Cameta were the Couxio (Pithecia\r\nSatanas)—a large species, clothed with long brownish-black hair—and the\r\ntiny Midas argentatus. The Couxio has a thick bushy tail, and the hair\r\nof the head, which looks as if it had been carefully combed, sits on it\r\nlike a wig. It inhabits only the most retired parts of the forest, on\r\nthe terra firma, and I observed nothing of its habits. The little Midas\r\nargentatus is one of the rarest of the American monkeys; indeed, I have\r\nnot heard of its being found anywhere except near Cametá, where I once\r\nsaw three individuals, looking like so many white kittens, running\r\nalong a branch in a cacao grove; in their motions, they resembled\r\nprecisely the Midas ursulus already described. I saw afterwards a pet\r\nanimal of this species, and heard that there were many so kept, and\r\nthat they were esteemed as great treasures. The one mentioned was\r\nfull-grown, although it measured only seven inches in length of body.\r\nIt was covered with long, white, silky hairs, the tail being blackish,\r\nand the face nearly naked and flesh-coloured. It was a most timid and\r\nsensitive little thing. The woman who owned it carried it constantly in\r\nher bosom, and no money would induce her to part with her pet. She\r\ncalled it Mico. It fed from her mouth and allowed her to fondle it\r\nfreely, but the nervous little creature would not permit strangers to\r\ntouch it. If any one attempted to do so, it shrank back, the whole body\r\ntrembling with fear, and its teeth chattered whilst it uttered its\r\ntremulous, frightened tones. The expression of its features was like\r\nthat of its more robust brother, Midas ursulus; the eyes, which were\r\nblack, were full of curiosity and mistrust, and were always kept fixed\r\nupon the person who attempted to advance towards it.\r\n\r\nIn the orange groves and other parts, humming-birds were plentiful, but\r\nI did not notice more than three species. I saw one day a little pigmy\r\nbelonging to the genus Phæthornis in the act of washing itself in a\r\nbrook; perched on a thin branch, one end of which was under water. It\r\ndipped itself, then fluttered its wings and pruned its feathers, and\r\nseemed thoroughly to enjoy itself alone in the shady nook which it had\r\nchosen—a place overshadowed by broad leaves of ferns and Heliconiæ. I\r\nthought, as I watched it, that there was no need for poets to invent\r\nelves and gnomes whilst Nature furnishes us with such marvellous little\r\nsprites ready at hand.\r\n\r\nMy return-journey to Pará afforded many incidents characteristic of\r\nAmazonian travelling. I left Cametá on the 16th of July. My luggage was\r\nembarked in the morning in the _ Santa Rosa_, a vessel of the kind\r\ncalled cuberta, or covered canoe. The cuberta is very much used on\r\nthese rivers. It is not decked, but the sides forward are raised and\r\narched over so as to admit of cargo being piled high above the\r\nwater-line. At the stern is a neat square cabin, also raised, and\r\nbetween the cabin and covered forepart is a narrow piece decked over,\r\non which are placed the cooking arrangements. This is called the\r\ntombadilha or quarterdeck, and when the canoe is heavily laden, it goes\r\nunderwater as the vessel heels over to the wind. There are two masts,\r\nrigged with fore and aft sails. The foremast has often besides a main\r\nand top sail. The forepart is planked over at the top, and on this\r\nraised deck the crew work the vessel, pulling it along, when there is\r\nno wind, by means of the long oars already described.\r\n\r\nAs I have just said, my luggage was embarked in the morning. I was\r\ninformed that we should start with the ebb-tide in the afternoon; so I\r\nthought I should have time to pay my respects to Dr. Angelo and other\r\nfriends, whose extreme courtesy and goodness had made my residence at\r\nCametá so agreeable. After dinner the guests, according to custom at\r\nthe house of the Correias, walked into the cool verandah which\r\noverlooks the river; and there we saw the _Santa Rosa_, a mere speck in\r\nthe offing miles away, tacking down river with a fine breeze. I was now\r\nin a fix, for it would be useless attempting to overtake the cuberta,\r\nand besides the sea ran too high for any montaria. I was then told that\r\nI ought to have been aboard hours before the time fixed for starting,\r\nbecause when a breeze springs up, vessels start before the tide turns;\r\nthe last hour of the flood not being very strong. All my precious\r\ncollections, my clothes, and other necessaries were on board, and it\r\nwas indispensable that I should be at Pará when the things were\r\ndisembarked. I tried to hire a montaria and men, but was told that it\r\nwould be madness to cross the river in a small boat with this breeze.\r\nOn going to Senhor Laroque, another of my Cametá friends, I was\r\nrelieved of my embarrassment, for I found there an English gentleman,\r\nMr. Patchett of Pernambuco, who was visiting Pará and its neighbourhood\r\non his way to England, and who, as he was going back to Pará in a small\r\nboat with four paddles, which would start at midnight, kindly offered\r\nme a passage. The evening from seven to ten o’clock was very stormy.\r\nAbout seven, the night became intensely dark, and a terrific squall of\r\nwind burst forth, which made the loose tiles fly over the housetops; to\r\nthis succeeded lightning and stupendous claps of thunder, both nearly\r\nsimultaneous. We had had several of these short and sharp storms during\r\nthe past month. At midnight, when we embarked, all was as calm as\r\nthough a ruffle had never disturbed air, forest, or river. The boat\r\nsped along like an arrow to the rhythmic paddling of the four stout\r\nyouths we had with us, who enlivened the passage with their wild songs.\r\nMr. Patchett and I tried to get a little sleep, but the cabin was so\r\nsmall and encumbered with boxes placed at all sorts of angles, that we\r\nfound sleep impossible. I was just dozing when the day dawned, and, on\r\nawakening, the first object I saw was the _Santa Rosa_, at anchor under\r\na green island in mid-river. I preferred to make the remainder of the\r\nvoyage in company of my collections, so bade Mr. Patchett good-day. The\r\nowner of the _Santa Rosa_, Senhor Jacinto Machado, whom I had not seen\r\nbefore, received me aboard, and apologised for having started without\r\nme. He was a white man, a planter, and was now taking his year’s\r\nproduction of cacao, about twenty tons, to Pará. The canoe was very\r\nheavily laden, and I was rather alarmed to see that it was leaking at\r\nall points. The crew were all in the water diving about to feel for the\r\nholes, which they stopped with pieces of ray and clay, and an old negro\r\nwas baling the water out of the hold. This was a pleasant prospect for\r\na three-day voyage! Senhor Machado treated it as the most ordinary\r\nincident possible: “It was always likely to leak, for it was an old\r\nvessel that had been left as worthless high and dry on the beach, and\r\nhe had bought it very cheap.”\r\n\r\nWhen the leaks were stopped, we proceeded on our journey and at night\r\nreached the mouth of the Anapú. I wrapped myself in an old sail, and\r\nfell asleep on the raised deck. The next day, we threaded the\r\nIgarapé-mirim, and on the 19th descended the Mojú. Senhor Machado and I\r\nby this time had become very good friends. At every interesting spot on\r\nthe banks of the Mojú, he manned the small boat and took me ashore.\r\nThere are many large houses on this river belonging to what were\r\nformerly large and flourishing plantations, but which, since the\r\nRevolution of 1835-6, had been suffered to go to decay. Two of the\r\nlargest buildings were constructed by the Jesuits in the early part of\r\nthe last century. We were told that there were formerly eleven large\r\nsugar mills on the banks of the Mojú, whilst now there are only three.\r\nAt Burujúba, there is a large monastery in a state of ruin; part of the\r\nedifice, however, was still inhabited by a Brazilian family. The walls\r\nare four feet in thickness. The long dark corridors and gloomy\r\ncloisters struck me as very inappropriate in the midst of this young\r\nand radiant nature. They would be better if placed on some barren moor\r\nin Northern Europe than here in the midst of perpetual summer. The next\r\nturn in the river below Burujúba brought the city of Pará into view.\r\nThe wind was now against us, and we were obliged to tack about. Towards\r\nevening, it began to blow stiffly, the vessel heeled over very much,\r\nand Senhor Machado, for the first time, trembled for the safety of his\r\ncargo; the leaks burst out afresh when we were yet two miles from the\r\nshore. He ordered another sail to be hoisted in order to run more\r\nquickly into port, but soon afterwards an extra puff of wind came, and\r\nthe old boat lurched alarmingly, the rigging gave way, and down fell\r\nboom and sail with a crash, encumbering us with the wreck. We were then\r\nobliged to have recourse to oars; and as soon as we were near the land,\r\nfearing that the crazy vessel would sink before reaching port, I begged\r\nSenhor Machado to send me ashore in the boat with the more precious\r\nportion of my collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\nCARAPÍ AND THE BAY OF MARAJÓ\r\n\r\n\r\nRiver Pará and Bay of Marajó — Journey to Caripí — Negro Observance of\r\nChristmas — A German Family — Bats — Ant-eaters — Humming-birds —\r\nExcursion to the Murucupí — Domestic Life of the Inhabitants — Hunting\r\nExcursion with Indians — White Ants.\r\n\r\nThat part of the Pará river which lies in front of the city, as I have\r\nalready explained, forms a narrow channel, being separated from the\r\nmain waters of the estuary by a cluster of islands. This channel is\r\nabout two miles broad, and constitutes part of the minor estuary of\r\nGoajará, into which the three rivers Guamá, Mojú, and Acará discharge\r\ntheir waters. The main channel of the Pará lies ten miles away from the\r\ncity, directly across the river; at that point, after getting clear of\r\nthe islands, a great expanse of water is beheld, ten to twelve miles in\r\nwidth; on the opposite shore the island of Marajó, being visible only\r\nin clear weather as a line of tree-tops dotting the horizon. A little\r\nfurther upwards, that is to the southwest, the mainland on the right or\r\neastern shore appears, this is called Carnapijó; it is rocky, covered\r\nwith the never-ending forest, and the coast, which is fringed with\r\nbroad sandy beaches, describes a gentle curve inwards. The broad reach\r\nof the Pará in front of this coast is called the Bahia, or Bay of\r\nMarajó. The coast and the interior of the land are peopled by civilised\r\nIndians and Mamelucos, with a mixture of free negroes and mulattos.\r\nThey are poor, for the waters are not abundant in fish, and they are\r\ndependent for a livelihood solely on their small plantations, and the\r\nscant supply of game found in the woods. The district was originally\r\npeopled by various tribes of Indians, of whom the principal were the\r\nTupinambás and Nhengahíbas. Like all the coast tribes, whether\r\ninhabiting the banks of the Amazons or the seashore between Pará and\r\nBahia, they were far more advanced in civilisation than the hordes\r\nscattered through the interior of the country, some of which still\r\nremain in the wild state, between the Amazons and the Plata. There are\r\nthree villages on the coast of Carnapijó, and several planters’ houses,\r\nformerly the centres of flourishing estates, which have now relapsed\r\ninto forest in consequence of the scarcity of labour and diminished\r\nenterprise. One of the largest of these establishments is called\r\nCaripí. At the time of which I am speaking, it belonged to a Scotch\r\ngentleman, Mr. Campbell, who had married the daughter of a large\r\nBrazilian proprietor. Most of the occasional English and American\r\nvisitors to Pará had made some stay at Caripí, and it had obtained\r\nquite a reputation for the number and beauty of the birds and insects\r\nfound there; I therefore applied for, and obtained permission, to spend\r\ntwo or three months at the place. The distance from Pará was about\r\ntwenty-three miles, round by the northern end of the Ilha das oncas\r\n(Isle of Tigers), which faces the city. I bargained for a passage\r\nthither with the cabo of a small trading-vessel, which was going past\r\nthe place, and started on the 7th of December, 1848.\r\n\r\nWe were thirteen persons aboard: the cabo, his pretty mulatto mistress,\r\nthe pilot and five Indian canoemen, three young mamelucos\r\n(tailor-apprentices who were taking a holiday trip to Cametá), a\r\nheavily chained runaway slave, and myself. The young mamelucos were\r\npleasant, gentle fellows; they could read and write, and amused\r\nthemselves on the voyage with a book containing descriptions and\r\nstatistics of foreign countries, in which they seemed to take great\r\ninterest—one reading whilst the others listened. At Uirapiranga, a\r\nsmall island behind the Ilha das oncas, we had to stop a short time to\r\nembark several pipes of cashaça at a sugar estate. The cabo took the\r\nmontaria and two men; the pipes were rolled into the water and floated\r\nto the canoe, the men passing cables round and towing them through a\r\nrough sea. Here we slept, and the following morning, continuing our\r\nvoyage, entered a narrow channel which intersects the land of\r\nCarnapijó. At 2 p.m. we emerged from this channel, which is called the\r\nAititúba, or Arrozal, into the broad Bahia, and then saw, two or three\r\nmiles away to the left, the red-tiled mansion of Caripí, embosomed in\r\nwoods on the shores of a charming little bay.\r\n\r\nThe water is very shallow near the shore, and when the wind blows there\r\nis a heavy ground swell. A few years previously, an English gentleman,\r\nMr. Graham, an amateur naturalist, was capsized here and drowned with\r\nhis wife and child, whilst passing in a heavily-laden montaria to his\r\nlarge canoe. Remembering their fate, I was rather alarmed to see that I\r\nshould be obliged to take all my luggage ashore in one trip in a leaky\r\nlittle boat. The pile of chests with two Indians and myself sank the\r\nmontaria almost to the level of the water. I was kept busy bailing all\r\nthe way. The Indians manage canoes in this condition with admirable\r\nskill. They preserve the nicest equilibrium, and paddle so gently that\r\nnot the slightest oscillation is perceptible. On landing, an old\r\nnegress named Florinda, the feitora or manageress of the establishment\r\n(which was kept only as a poultry-farm and hospital for sick slaves),\r\ngave me the keys, and I forthwith took possession of the rooms I\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nI remained here nine weeks, or until the 12th of February, 1849. The\r\nhouse was very large and most substantially built, but consisted of\r\nonly one story. I was told it was built by the Jesuits more than a\r\ncentury ago. The front had no veranda, the doors opening upon a\r\nslightly elevated terrace about a hundred yards distant from the broad\r\nsandy beach. Around the residence the ground had been cleared to the\r\nextent of two or three acres, and was planted with fruit trees.\r\nWell-trodden pathways through the forest led to little colonies of the\r\nnatives on the banks of retired creeks and rivulets in the interior. I\r\nled here a solitary but not unpleasant life; for there was a great\r\ncharm in the loneliness of the place. The swell of the river beating on\r\nthe sloping beach caused an unceasing murmur, which lulled me to sleep\r\nat night, and seemed appropriate music in those midday hours when all\r\nnature was pausing breathless under the rays of a vertical sun. Here I\r\nspent my first Christmas Day in a foreign land. The festival was\r\ncelebrated by the negroes of their own free will and in a very pleasing\r\nmanner. The room next to the one I had chosen was the capella, or\r\nchapel. It had a little altar which was neatly arranged, and the room\r\nwas furnished with a magnificent brass chandelier. Men, women, and\r\nchildren were busy in the chapel all day on the 24th of December\r\ndecorating the altar with flowers and strewing the floor with\r\norange-leaves. They invited some of their neighbours to the evening\r\nprayers, and when the simple ceremony began an hour before midnight,\r\nthe chapel was crowded. They were obliged to dispense with the mass,\r\nfor they had no priest; the service therefore consisted merely of a\r\nlong litany and a few hymns. There was placed on the altar a small\r\nimage of the infant Christ, the “Menino Deos” as they called it, or the\r\nchild-god, which had a long ribbon depending from its waist. An old\r\nwhite-haired negro led off the litany, and the rest of the people\r\njoined in the responses. After the service was over they all went up to\r\nthe altar, one by one, and kissed the end of the ribbon. The gravity\r\nand earnestness shown throughout the proceedings were remarkable. Some\r\nof the hymns were very simple and beautiful, especially one beginning\r\n“Virgem soberana,” a trace of whose melody springs to my recollection\r\nwhenever I think on the dreamy solitude of Caripí.\r\n\r\nThe next day after I arrived, two blue-eyed and red-haired boys came up\r\nand spoke to me in English, and presently their father made his\r\nappearance. They proved to be a German family named Petzell, who were\r\nliving in the woods, Indian fashion, about a mile from Caripí. Petzell\r\nexplained to me how he came here. He said that thirteen years ago he\r\ncame to Brazil with a number of other Germans under engagement to serve\r\nin the Brazilian army. When his time had expired he came to Pará to see\r\nthe country, but after a few months’ rambling left the place to\r\nestablish himself in the United States. There he married, went to\r\nIllinois, and settled as farmer near St. Louis. He remained on his farm\r\nseven or eight years, and had a family of five children. He could never\r\nforget, however, the free river-life and perpetual summer of the banks\r\nof the Amazons; so, he persuaded his wife to consent to break up their\r\nhome in North America, and migrate to Pará. No one can imagine the\r\ndifficulties the poor fellow had to go through before reaching the land\r\nof his choice. He first descended the Mississippi, feeling sure that a\r\npassage to Pará could be got at New Orleans. He was there told that the\r\nonly port in North America he could start from was New York, so away he\r\nsailed for New York; but there was no chance of a vessel sailing thence\r\nto Pará, so he took a passage to Demerara, as bringing him, at any\r\nrate, near to the desired land. There is no communication whatever\r\nbetween Demerara and Pará, and he was forced to remain here with his\r\nfamily four or five months, during which they all caught the yellow\r\nfever, and one of his children died. At length, he heard of a small\r\ncoasting vessel going to Cayenne, so he embarked, and thereby got\r\nanother stage nearer the end of his journey. A short time after\r\nreaching Cayenne, he shipped in a schooner that was going to Pará, or\r\nrather the island of Marajó, for a cargo of cattle. He had now fixed\r\nhimself, after all his wanderings, in a healthy and fertile little nook\r\non the banks of a rivulet near Caripí, built himself a log-hut, and\r\nplanted a large patch of mandioca and Indian corn. He seemed to be\r\nquite happy, but his wife complained much of the want of wholesome\r\nfood, meat, and wheaten bread. I asked the children whether they liked\r\nthe country; they shook their heads, and said they would rather be in\r\nIllinois. Petzell told me that his Indian neighbours treated him very\r\nkindly; one or other of them called almost every day to see how he was\r\ngetting on, and they had helped him in many ways. He had a high opinion\r\nof the Tapuyos, and said, “If you treat them well, they will go through\r\nfire to serve you.”\r\n\r\nPetzell and his family were expert insect-collectors, so I employed\r\nthem at this work during my stay at Caripí. The daily occurrences here\r\nwere after a uniform fashion. I rose with the dawn, took a cup of\r\ncoffee, and then sallied forth after birds. At ten I breakfasted, and\r\ndevoted the hours from ten until three to entomology. The evening was\r\noccupied in preserving and storing my captures. Petzell and I sometimes\r\nundertook long excursions, occupying the whole day. Our neighbours used\r\nto bring me all the quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and shells they met\r\nwith, and so altogether I was enabled to acquire a good collection of\r\nthe productions of the district.\r\n\r\nThe first few nights I was much troubled by bats. The room where I\r\nslept had not been used for many months, and the roof was open to the\r\ntiles and rafters. The first night I slept soundly and did not perceive\r\nanything unusual, but on the next I was aroused about midnight by the\r\nrushing noise made by vast hosts of bats sweeping about the room. The\r\nair was alive with them; they had put out the lamp, and when I\r\nrelighted it the place appeared blackened with the impish multitudes\r\nthat were whirling round and round. After I had laid about well with a\r\nstick for a few minutes, they disappeared amongst the tiles, but when\r\nall was still again they returned, and once more extinguished the\r\nlight. I took no further notice of them, and went to sleep. The next\r\nnight several got into my hammock; I seized them as they were crawling\r\nover me, and dashed them against the wall. The next morning I found a\r\nwound, evidently caused by a bat, on my hip. This was rather\r\nunpleasant, so I set to work with the negroes, and tried to exterminate\r\nthem. I shot a great many as they hung from the rafters, and the\r\nnegroes having mounted with ladders to the roof outside, routed out\r\nfrom beneath the caves many hundreds of them, including young broods.\r\nThere were altogether four species—two belonging to the genus Dysopes,\r\none to Phyllostoma, and the fourth to Glossophaga. By far the greater\r\nnumber belonged to the Dysopes perotis, a species having very large\r\nears, and measuring two feet from tip to tip of the wings. The\r\nPhyllostoma was a small kind, of a dark-grey colour, streaked with\r\nwhite down the back, and having a leaf-shaped fleshy expansion on the\r\ntip of the nose. I was never attacked by bats except on this occasion.\r\nThe fact of their sucking the blood of persons sleeping, from wounds\r\nwhich they make in the toes, is now well established; but it is only a\r\nfew persons who are subject to this blood-letting. According to the\r\nnegroes, the Phyllostoma is the only kind which attacks man. Those\r\nwhich I caught crawling over me were Dysopes, and I am inclined to\r\nthink many different kinds of bats have this propensity.\r\n\r\nOne day I was occupied searching for insects in the bark of a fallen\r\ntree, when I saw a large cat-like animal advancing towards the spot. It\r\ncame within a dozen yards before perceiving me. I had no weapon with me\r\nbut an old chisel, and was getting ready to defend myself if it should\r\nmake a spring, when it turned around hastily and trotted off. I did not\r\nobtain a very distinct view of it, but I could see its colour was that\r\nof the Puma, or American Lion, although it was rather too small for\r\nthat species. The Puma is not a common animal in the Amazons forests. I\r\ndid not see altogether more than a dozen skins, in the possession of\r\nthe natives. The fur is of a fawn colour. On account of its hue\r\nresembling that of a deer common in the forests, the natives call it\r\nthe Sassú-arána,[1] or the false deer; that is, an animal which\r\ndeceives one at first sight by its superficial resemblance to a deer.\r\nThe hunters are not at all afraid of it, and speak always in\r\ndisparaging terms of its courage. Of the Jaguar, they give a very\r\ndifferent account.\r\n\r\n [1] The old zoologist Marcgrave called the Puma the Cuguacuarana,\r\n probably (the c’s being soft) a misspelling of Sassú-arána; hence, the\r\n name Cougouar employed by French zoologists, and copied in most works\r\n on natural history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only species of monkey I met with at Caripí was the same\r\ndark-coloured little Midas already mentioned as found near Pará. The\r\ngreat Ant-eater, Tamandua of the natives (Myrmecophaga jubata), was not\r\nuncommon here. After the first few weeks of residence, I ran short of\r\nfresh provisions. The people of the neighbourhood had sold me all the\r\nfowls they could spare; I had not yet learned to eat the stale and\r\nstringy salt-fish which is the staple food in these places, and for\r\nseveral days I had lived on rice-porridge, roasted bananas, and\r\nfarinha. Florinda asked me whether I could eat Tamanduá. I told her\r\nalmost anything in the shape of flesh would be acceptable; so the same\r\nday she went with an old negro named Antonio and the dogs, and in the\r\nevening brought one of the animals. The meat was stewed and turned out\r\nvery good, something like goose in flavour. The people at Caripí would\r\nnot touch a morsel, saying it was not considered fit to eat in these\r\nparts; I had read, however, that it was an article of food in other\r\ncountries of South America. During the next two or three weeks,\r\nwhenever we were short of fresh meat, Antonio was always ready, for a\r\nsmall reward, to get me a Tamanduá. But one day he came to me in great\r\ndistress, with the news that his favourite dog, Atrevido, had been\r\ncaught in the grip of an ant-eater, and was killed. We hastened to the\r\nplace, and found the dog was not dead, but severely torn by the claws\r\nof the animal, which itself was mortally wounded, and was now relaxing\r\nits grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnt-eater grappling with dog.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Myrmecophaga jubata are now pretty well known. It is\r\nnot uncommon in the drier forests of the Amazons valley, but is not\r\nfound, I believe, in the Ygapó, or flooded lands. The Brazilians call\r\nthe species the Tamanduá bandeira, or the Banner Ant-eater, the term\r\nbanner being applied in allusion to the curious colouration of the\r\nanimal, each side of the body having a broad oblique stripe, half grey\r\nand half black, which gives it some resemblance to a heraldic banner.\r\nIt has an excessively long slender muzzle, and a wormlike extensile\r\ntongue. Its jaws are destitute of teeth. The claws are much elongated,\r\nand its gait is very awkward. It lives on the ground, and feeds on\r\ntermites, or white ants; the long claws being employed to pull in\r\npieces the solid hillocks made by the insects, and the long flexible\r\ntongue to lick them up from the crevices. All the other species of this\r\nsingular genus are arboreal. I met with four species altogether. One\r\nwas the Myrmecophaga tetradactyla; the two others, more curious and\r\nless known, were very small kinds, called Tamanduá-i. Both are similar\r\nin size—ten inches in length, exclusive of the tail—and in the number\r\nof the claws, having two of unequal length to the anterior feet, and\r\nfour to the hind feet. One species is clothed with greyish-yellow silky\r\nhair; this is of rare occurrence. The other has a fur of a dingy brown\r\ncolour, without silky lustre. One was brought to me alive at Caripí,\r\nhaving been caught by an Indian, clinging motionless inside a hollow\r\ntree. I kept it in the house about twenty-four hours. It had a\r\nmoderately long snout, curved downwards, and extremely small eyes. It\r\nremained nearly all the time without motion except when irritated, in\r\nwhich case it reared itself on its hind legs from the back of a chair\r\nto which it clung, and clawed out with its forepaws like a cat. Its\r\nmanner of clinging with its claws, and the sluggishness of its motions,\r\ngave it a great resemblance to a sloth. It uttered no sound, and\r\nremained all night on the spot where I had placed it in the morning.\r\nThe next day, I put it on a tree in the open air, and at night it\r\nescaped. These small Tamanduás are nocturnal in their habits, and feed\r\non those species of termites which construct earthy nests that look\r\nlike ugly excrescences on the trunks and branches of trees. The\r\ndifferent kinds of ant-eaters are thus adapted to various modes of\r\nlife, terrestrial and arboreal. Those which live on trees are again\r\neither diurnal or nocturnal, for Myrmecophaga tetradactyla is seen\r\nmoving along the main branches in the daytime. The allied group of the\r\nSloths, which are still more exclusively South American forms than\r\nant-eaters are, at the present time furnish arboreal species only, but\r\nformerly terrestrial forms of sloths also existed, as the Megatherium,\r\nwhose mode of life was a puzzle, seeing that it was of too colossal a\r\nsize to live on trees, until Owen showed how it might have obtained its\r\nfood from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nHumming-bird and Humming-bird Hawk-moth.\r\n\r\nIn January the orange-trees became covered with blossom—at least to a\r\ngreater extent than usual, for they flower more or less in this country\r\nall the year round—and attracting a great number of humming-birds.\r\nEvery day, in the cooler hours of the morning, and in the evening from\r\nfour o’clock until six, they were to be seen whirring about the trees\r\nby scores. Their motions are unlike those of all other birds. They dart\r\nto and fro so swiftly that the eye can scarcely follow them, and when\r\nthey stop before a flower, it is only for a few moments. They poise\r\nthemselves in an unsteady manner, their wings moving with inconceivable\r\nrapidity, probe the flower, and then shoot off to another part of the\r\ntree. They do not proceed in that methodical manner which bees follow,\r\ntaking the flowers seriatim, but skip about from one part of the tree\r\nto another in the most capricious way. Sometimes two males close with\r\neach other and fight, mounting upwards in the struggle, as insects are\r\noften seen to do when similarly engaged, and then separating hastily\r\nand darting back to their work. Now and then they stop to rest,\r\nperching on leafless twigs, where they may be sometimes seen probing,\r\nfrom the places where they sit, the flowers within their reach. The\r\nbrilliant colours with which they are adorned cannot be seen whilst\r\nthey are fluttering about, nor can the different species be\r\ndistinguished unless they have a deal of white hue in their plumage,\r\nsuch as Heliothrix auritus, which is wholly white underneath, although\r\nof a glittering green colour above, and the white-tailed Florisuga\r\nmellivora. There is not a great variety of humming-birds in the Amazons\r\nregion, the number of species being far smaller in these uniform forest\r\nplains than in the diversified valleys of the Andes, under the same\r\nparallels of latitude. The family is divisible into two groups,\r\ncontrasted in form and habits: one containing species which live\r\nentirely in the shade of the forest, and the other comprising those\r\nwhich prefer open sunny places. The forest species (Phaethorninæ) are\r\nseldom seen at flowers, flowers being, in the shady places where they\r\nabide, of rare occurrence; but they search for insects on leaves,\r\nthreading the bushes and passing above and beneath each leaf with\r\nwonderful rapidity. The other group (Trochilinæ) are not quite confined\r\nto cleared places, as they come into the forest wherever a tree is in\r\nblossom, and descend into sunny openings where flowers are to be found.\r\nBut it is only where the woods are less dense than usual that this is\r\nthe case; in the lofty forests and twilight shades of the lowlands and\r\nislands, they are scarcely ever seen. I searched well at Caripí,\r\nexpecting to find the Lophornis Gouldii, which I was told had been\r\nobtained in the locality. This is one of the most beautiful of all\r\nhumming-birds, having round the neck a frill of long white feathers\r\ntipped with golden green. I was not, however, so fortunate as to meet\r\nwith it. Several times I shot by mistake a humming-bird hawk-moth\r\ninstead of a bird. This moth (Macroglossa Titan) is somewhat smaller\r\nthan humming-birds generally are; but its manner of flight, and the way\r\nit poises itself before a flower whilst probing it with its proboscis,\r\nare precisely like the same actions of humming-birds. It was only after\r\nmany days’ experience that I learned to distinguish one from the other\r\nwhen on the wing. This resemblance has attracted the notice of the\r\nnatives, all of whom, even educated whites, firmly believe that one is\r\ntransmutable into the other. They have observed the metamorphosis of\r\ncaterpillars into butterflies, and think it not at all more wonderful\r\nthat a moth should change into a humming-bird. The resemblance between\r\nthis hawk-moth and a humming-bird is certainly very curious, and\r\nstrikes one even when both are examined in the hand. Holding them\r\nsideways, the shape of the head and position of the eyes in the moth\r\nare seen to be nearly the same as in the bird, the extended proboscis\r\nrepresenting the long beak. At the tip of the moth’s body there is a\r\nbrush of long hair-scales resembling feathers, which, being expanded,\r\nlooks very much like a bird’s tail. But, of course, all these points of\r\nresemblance are merely superficial. The negroes and Indians tried to\r\nconvince me that the two were of the same species. “Look at their\r\nfeathers,” they said; “their eyes are the same, and so are their\r\ntails.” This belief is so deeply rooted that it was useless to reason\r\nwith them on the subject. The Macroglossa moths are found in most\r\ncountries, and have everywhere the same habits; one well-known species\r\nis found in England. Mr. Gould relates that he once had a stormy\r\naltercation with an English gentleman, who affirmed that humming-birds\r\nwere found in England, for he had seen one flying in Devonshire,\r\nmeaning thereby the moth Macroglossa stellatarum. The analogy between\r\nthe two creatures has been brought about, probably, by the similarity\r\nof their habits, there being no indication of the one having been\r\nadapted in outward appearance with reference to the other.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that humming-birds are unlike other birds in their\r\nmental qualities, resembling in this respect insects rather than\r\nwarm-blooded vertebrate animals. The want of expression in their eyes,\r\nthe small degree of versatility in their actions, the quickness and\r\nprecision of their movements, are all so many points of resemblance\r\nbetween them and insects. In walking along the alleys of the forest, a\r\nPhaethornis frequently crosses one’s path, often stopping suddenly and\r\nremaining poised in mid-air, a few feet distant from the face of the\r\nintruder. The Phaethorninæ are certainly more numerous in the Amazons\r\nregion than the Trochilinæ. They build their nests, which are made of\r\nfine vegetable fibres and lichens; densely woven together and thickly\r\nlined with silk-cotton from the fruit of the samaüma tree (Eriodendron\r\nsamauma); and on the inner sides lined with of the tips of palm-fronds.\r\nThey are long and purse-shaped. The young when first hatched have very\r\nmuch shorter bills than their parents. The only species of Trochilinæ\r\nwhich I found at Caripí were the little brassy-green Polytmus\r\nviridissimus, the sapphire and emerald (Thalurania furcata), and the\r\nlarge falcate-winged Campylopterus obscurus.\r\n\r\nSnakes were very numerous at Caripí; many harmless species were found\r\nnear the house, and these sometimes came into the rooms. I was\r\nwandering one day amongst the green bushes of Guajará, a tree which\r\nyields a grape-like berry (Chrysobalanus Icaco) and grows along all\r\nthese sandy shores, when I was startled by what appeared to be the\r\nflexuous stem of a creeping plant endowed with life and threading its\r\nway amongst the leaves and branches. This animated liana turned out to\r\nbe a pale-green snake, the Dryophis fulgida. Its whole body is of the\r\nsame green hue, and it is thus rendered undistinguishable amidst the\r\nfoliage of the Guajará bushes, where it prowls in search of its prey,\r\ntree-frogs and lizards. The forepart of its head is prolonged into a\r\nslender pointed beak, and the total length of the reptile was six feet.\r\nThere was another kind found amongst bushes on the borders of the\r\nforest closely allied to this, but much more slender, viz., the\r\nDryophis acuminata. This grows to a length of four feet eight inches,\r\nthe tail alone being twenty-two inches; but the diameter of the\r\nthickest part of the body is little more than a quarter of an inch. It\r\nis of light-brown colour, with iridescent shades variegated with\r\nobscurer markings, and looks like a piece of whipcord. One individual\r\nwhich I caught of this species had a protuberance near the middle of\r\nthe body. Upon opening it, I found a half-digested lizard which was\r\nmuch more bulky than the snake itself. Another kind of serpent found\r\nhere, a species of Helicops, was amphibious in its habits. I saw\r\nseveral of this in wet weather on the beach, which, on being\r\napproached, always made straightway for the water, where they swam with\r\nmuch grace and dexterity. Florinda one day caught a Helicops whilst\r\nangling for fish, it having swallowed the fishhook with the bait. She\r\nand others told me these water-snakes lived on small fishes, but I did\r\nnot meet with any proof of the statement. In the woods, snakes were\r\nconstantly occurring; it was not often, however, that I saw poisonous\r\nspecies. There were many arboreal kinds besides the two just mentioned;\r\nand it was rather alarming, in entomologising about the trunks of\r\ntrees, to suddenly encounter, on turning round, as sometimes happened,\r\na pair of glittering eyes and a forked tongue within a few inches of\r\none’s head. The last kind I shall mention is the Coral-snake, which is\r\na most beautiful object when seen coiled up on black soil in the woods.\r\nThe one I saw here was banded with black and vermilion, the black bands\r\nhaving each two clear white rings. The state of specimens preserved in\r\nspirits can give no idea of the brilliant colours which adorn the\r\nCoral-snake in life.\r\n\r\nPetzell and I, as already mentioned, made many excursions of long\r\nextent in the neighbouring forest. We sometimes went to Murucupí, a\r\ncreek which passes through the forest, about four miles behind Caripí,\r\nthe banks of which are inhabited by Indians and half-breeds who have\r\nlived there for many generations in perfect seclusion from the rest of\r\nthe world, the place being little known or frequented. A path from\r\nCaripí leads to it through a gloomy tract of virgin forest, where the\r\ntrees are so closely packed together that the ground beneath is thrown\r\ninto the deepest shade, under which nothing but fetid fungi and rotting\r\nvegetable debris is to be seen. On emerging from this unfriendly\r\nsolitude near the banks of the Murucupí, a charming contrast is\r\npresented. A glorious vegetation, piled up to an immense height,\r\nclothes the banks of the creek, which traverses a broad tract of\r\nsemi-cultivated ground, and the varied masses of greenery are lighted\r\nup with the sunny glow. Open palm-thatched huts peep forth here and\r\nthere from amidst groves of banana, mango, cotton, and papaw trees and\r\npalms. On our first excursion, we struck the banks of the river in\r\nfront of a house of somewhat more substantial architecture than the\r\nrest, having finished mud walls that were plastered and whitewashed,\r\nand had a covering of red tiles. It seemed to be full of children, and\r\nthe aspect of the household was improved by a number of good-looking\r\nmameluco women, who were busily employed washing, spinning, and making\r\nfarinha. Two of them, seated on a mat in the open verandah, were\r\nengaged sewing dresses, for a festival was going to take place a few\r\ndays hence at Balcarem, a village eight miles distant from Murucupí,\r\nand they intended to be present to hear mass and show their finery. One\r\nof the children, a naked boy about seven years of age, crossed over\r\nwith the montaria to fetch us. We were made welcome at once, and asked\r\nto stay for dinner. On our accepting the invitation, a couple of fowls\r\nwere killed, and a wholesome stew of seasoned rice and fowls soon put\r\ninto preparation. It is not often that the female members of a family\r\nin these retired places are familiar with strangers; but, these people\r\nhad lived a long time in the capital, and therefore, were more\r\ncivilised than their neighbours. Their father had been a prosperous\r\ntradesman, and had given them the best education the place afforded.\r\nAfter his death the widow with several daughters, married and\r\nunmarried, retired to this secluded spot, which had been their sitio,\r\nfarm or country-house, for many years. One of the daughters was married\r\nto a handsome young mulatto, who was present, and sang us some pretty\r\nsongs, accompanying himself on the guitar.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I expressed a wish to see more of the creek; so a lively\r\nand polite old man, whom I took to be one of the neighbours,\r\nvolunteered as guide. We embarked in a little montaria, and paddled\r\nsome three or four miles up and down the stream. Although I had now\r\nbecome familiarised with beautiful vegetation, all the glow of fresh\r\nadmiration came again to me in this place. The creek was about a\r\nhundred yards wide, but narrower in some places. Both banks were masked\r\nby lofty walls of green drapery, here and there a break occurring,\r\nthrough which, under overarching trees, glimpses were obtained of the\r\npalm-thatched huts of settlers. The projecting boughs of lofty trees,\r\nwhich in some places stretched half-way across the creek, were hung\r\nwith natural garlands and festoons, and an endless variety of creeping\r\nplants clothed the water-frontage, some of which, especially the\r\nBignonias, were ornamented with large gaily-coloured flowers. Art could\r\nnot have assorted together beautiful vegetable forms so harmoniously as\r\nwas here done by Nature. Palms, as usual, formed a large proportion of\r\nthe lower trees; some of them, however, shot up their slim stems to a\r\nheight of sixty feet or more, and waved their bunches of nodding plumes\r\nbetween us and the sky. One kind of palm, the Pashiúba (Iriartea\r\nexorhiza), which grows here in greater abundance than elsewhere, was\r\nespecially attractive. It is not one of the tallest kinds, for when\r\nfull-grown its height is not more, perhaps, than forty feet; the leaves\r\nare somewhat less drooping, and the leaflets much broader than in other\r\nspecies, so that they have not that feathery appearance which those of\r\nsome palms have, but still they possess their own peculiar beauty. My\r\nguide put me ashore in one place to show me the roots of the Pashiúba.\r\nThese grow above ground, radiating from the trunk many feet above the\r\nsurface, so that the tree looks as if supported on stilts; and a person\r\ncan, in old trees, stand upright amongst the roots with the\r\nperpendicular stem wholly above his head. It adds to the singularity of\r\ntheir appearance that these roots, which have the form of straight\r\nrods, are studded with stout thorns, whilst the trunk of the tree is\r\nquite smooth. The purpose of this curious arrangement is, perhaps,\r\nsimilar to that of the buttress roots already described—namely, to\r\nrecompense the tree by root-growth above the soil for its inability, in\r\nconsequence of the competition of neighbouring roots, to extend it\r\nunderground. The great amount of moisture and nutriment contained in\r\nthe atmosphere may also favour these growths.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the house, I found Petzell had been well occupied\r\nduring the hot hours of the day collecting insects in a neighbouring\r\nclearing. Our kind hosts gave us a cup of coffee about five o’clock,\r\nand we then started for home. The last mile of our walk was performed\r\nin the dark. The forest in this part is obscure even in broad daylight,\r\nbut I was scarcely prepared for the intense opacity of darkness which\r\nreigned here on this night, and which prevented us from seeing each\r\nother whilst walking side by side. Nothing occurred of a nature to\r\nalarm us, except that now and then a sudden rush was heard amongst the\r\ntrees, and once a dismal shriek startled us. Petzell tripped at one\r\nplace and fell all his length into the thicket. With this exception, we\r\nkept well to the pathway, and in due time arrived safely at Caripí.\r\n\r\nOne of my neighbours at Murucupí was a hunter of reputation in these\r\nparts. He was a civilised Indian, married and settled, named Raimundo,\r\nwhose habit was to sally forth at intervals to certain productive\r\nhunting-grounds, the situation of which he kept secret, and procure\r\nfresh provisions for his family. I had found out by this time that\r\nanimal food was as much a necessary of life in this exhausting climate\r\nas it is in the North of Europe. An attempt which I made to live on\r\nvegetable food was quite a failure, and I could not eat the execrable\r\nsalt-fish which Brazilians use. I had been many days without meat of\r\nany kind, and nothing more was to be found near Caripí, so I asked as a\r\nfavour of Senhor Raimundo permission to accompany him on one of his\r\nhunting-trips, and shoot a little game for my own use. He consented,\r\nand appointed a day on which I was to come over to his house to sleep,\r\nso as to be ready for starting with the ebb-tide shortly after\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nThe locality we were to visit was situated near the extreme point of\r\nthe land of Carnapijó, where it projects northwardly into the middle of\r\nthe Pará estuary, and is broken into a number of islands. On the\r\nafternoon of January 11th, 1849, I walked through the woods to\r\nRaimundo’s house, taking nothing with me but a double-barrelled gun, a\r\nsupply of ammunition, and a box for the reception of any insects I\r\nmight capture. Raimundo was a carpenter, and seemed to be a very\r\nindustrious, man; he had two apprentices, Indians like himself—one a\r\nyoung lad, and the other apparently about twenty years of age. His wife\r\nwas of the same race. The Indian women are not always of a taciturn\r\ndisposition like their husbands. Senhora Dominga was very talkative;\r\nthere was another old squaw at the house on a visit, and the tongues of\r\nthe two were going at a great rate the whole evening, using only the\r\nTupí language. Raimundo and his apprentices were employed building a\r\ncanoe. Notwithstanding his industry, he seemed to be very poor, and\r\nthis was the condition of most of the residents on the banks of the\r\nMurucupí. They have, nevertheless, considerable plantations of mandioca\r\nand Indian corn, besides small plots of cotton, coffee, and sugarcane;\r\nthe soil is very fertile, they have no rent to pay, and no direct\r\ntaxes. There is, moreover, always a market in Pará, twenty miles\r\ndistant, for their surplus produce, and a ready communication with it\r\nby water.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had more visitors. The sounds of pipe and tabor were\r\nheard, and presently a procession of villagers emerged from a pathway\r\nthrough the mandioca fields. They were on a begging expedition for St.\r\nThomé, the patron saint of Indians and Mamelucos. One carried a banner,\r\non which was crudely painted the figure of St. Thomé with a glory round\r\nhis head. The pipe and tabor were of the simplest description. The pipe\r\nwas a reed pierced with four holes, by means of which a few unmusical\r\nnotes were produced, and the tabor was a broad hoop with a skin\r\nstretched over each end. A deformed young man played both the\r\ninstruments. Senhor Raimundo received them with the quiet politeness\r\nwhich comes so naturally to the Indian when occupying the position of\r\nhost. The visitors, who had come from the Villa de Condé, five miles\r\nthrough the forest, were invited to rest. Raimundo then took the image\r\nof St. Thomé from one of the party, and placed it by the side of Nossa\r\nSenhora in his own oratorio, a little decorated box in which every\r\nfamily keeps its household gods, finally lighting a couple of wax\r\ncandles before it. Shortly afterwards a cloth was laid on a mat, and\r\nall the guests were invited to supper. The fare was very scanty; a\r\nboiled fowl with rice, a slice of roasted pirarucú, farinha, and\r\nbananas. Each one partook very sparingly, some of the young men\r\ncontenting themselves with a plateful of rice. One of the apprentices\r\nstood behind with a bowl of water and a towel, with which each guest\r\nwashed his fingers and rinsed his mouth after the meal. They stayed all\r\nnight: the large open shed was filled with hammocks, which were slung\r\nfrom pole to pole; and upon retiring, Raimundo gave orders for their\r\nbreakfast in the morning.\r\n\r\nRaimundo called me at two o’clock, when we embarked (he, his older\r\napprentice Joaquim, and myself) in a shady place where it was so dark\r\nthat I could see neither canoe nor water, taking with us five dogs. We\r\nglided down a winding creek where huge trunks of trees slanted across\r\nclose overhead, and presently emerged into the Murucupí. A few yards\r\nfurther on we entered the broader channel of the Aititúba. This we\r\ncrossed, and entered another narrow creek on the opposite side. Here\r\nthe ebb-tide was against us, and we had great difficulty in making\r\nprogress. After we had struggled against the powerful current a\r\ndistance of two miles, we came to a part where the ebb-tide ran in the\r\nopposite direction, showing that we had crossed the watershed. The tide\r\nflows into this channel or creek at both ends simultaneously, and meets\r\nin the middle, although there is apparently no difference of level, and\r\nthe breadth of the water is the same. The tides are extremely intricate\r\nthroughout all the infinite channels and creeks which intersect the\r\nlands of the Amazons delta. The moon now broke forth and lighted up the\r\ntrunks of colossal trees, the leaves of monstrous Jupatí palms which\r\narched over the creek, and revealed groups of arborescent arums\r\nstanding like rows of spectres on its banks. We had a glimpse now and\r\nthen into the black depths of the forest, where all was silent except\r\nthe shrill stridulation of wood-crickets. Now and then a sudden plunge\r\nin the water ahead would startle us, caused by heavy fruit or some\r\nnocturnal animal dropping from the trees. The two Indians here rested\r\non their paddles and allowed the canoe to drift with the tide. A\r\npleasant perfume came from the forest, which Raimundo said proceeded\r\nfrom a cane-field. He told me that all this land was owned by large\r\nproprietors at Pará, who had received grants from time to time from the\r\nGovernment for political services. Raimundo was quite in a talkative\r\nhumour; he related to me many incidents of the time of the “Cabanagem,”\r\nas the revolutionary days of 1835-6 are popularly called. He said he\r\nhad been much suspected himself of being a rebel, but declared that the\r\nsuspicion was unfounded. The only complaint he had to make against the\r\nwhite man was that he monopolised the land without having any intention\r\nor prospect of cultivating it. He had been turned out of one place\r\nwhere he had squatted and cleared a large piece of forest. I believe\r\nthe law of Brazil at this time was that the new lands should become the\r\nproperty of those who cleared and cultivated them, if their right was\r\nnot disputed within a given term of years by some one who claimed the\r\nproprietorship. This land-law has since been repealed, and a new one\r\nadopted founded on that of the United States. Raimundo spoke of his\r\nrace as the redskins, “pelle vermelho;” they meant well to the whites,\r\nand only begged to be let alone. “God,” he said, “had given room enough\r\nfor us all.” It was pleasant to hear the shrewd good-natured fellow\r\ntalk in this strain. Our companion, Joaquim, had fallen asleep; the\r\nnight air was cool, and the moonlight lit up the features of Raimundo,\r\nrevealing a more animated expression than is usually observable in\r\nIndian countenances. I always noticed that Indians were more cheerful\r\non a voyage, especially in the cool hours of night and morning, than\r\nwhen ashore. There is something in their constitution of body which\r\nmakes them feel excessively depressed in the hot hours of the day,\r\nespecially inside their houses. Their skin is always hot to the touch.\r\nThey certainly do not endure the heat of their own climate so well as\r\nthe whites. The negroes are totally different in this respect; the heat\r\nof midday has very little effect on them, and they dislike the cold\r\nnights on the river.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at our hunting-ground about half-past four. The channel was\r\nbroader here and presented several ramifications. It yet wanted an hour\r\nand a half to daybreak, so Raimundo recommended me to have a nap. We\r\nboth stretched ourselves on the benches of the canoe and fell asleep,\r\nletting the boat drift with the tide, which was now slack. I slept well\r\nconsidering the hardness of our bed, and when I awoke in the middle of\r\na dream about home-scenes, the day was beginning to dawn. My clothes\r\nwere quite wet with the dew. The birds were astir, the cicadas had\r\nbegun their music, and the Urania Leilus, a strange and beautiful\r\ntailed and gilded moth, whose habits are those of a butterfly,\r\ncommenced to fly in flocks over the tree-tops. Raimundo exclaimed\r\n“Clareia o dia!”—“The day brightens!” The change was rapid: the sky in\r\nthe east assumed suddenly the loveliest azure colour, across which\r\nstreaks of thin white clouds were painted. It is at such moments as\r\nthis when one feels how beautiful our earth truly is! The channel on\r\nwhose waters our little boat was floating was about two hundred yards\r\nwide; others branched off right and left, surrounding the group of\r\nlonely islands which terminate the land of Carnapijó. The forest on all\r\nsides formed a lofty hedge without a break; below, it was fringed with\r\nmangrove bushes, whose small foliage contrasted with the large glossy\r\nleaves of the taller trees, or the feather and fan-shaped fronds of\r\npalms.\r\n\r\nBeing now arrived at our destination, Raimundo turned up his trousers\r\nand shirt-sleeves, took his long hunting-knife, and leapt ashore with\r\nthe dogs. He had to cut a gap in order to enter the forest. We expected\r\nto find Pacas and Cutías; and the method adopted to secure them was\r\nthis: at the present early hour they would be seen feeding on fallen\r\nfruits, but would quickly, on hearing a noise, betake themselves to\r\ntheir burrows; Raimundo was then to turn them out by means of the dogs,\r\nand Joaquim and I were to remain in the boat with our guns, ready to\r\nshoot all that came to the edge of the stream—the habits of both\r\nanimals, when hard-pressed, being to take to the water. We had not long\r\nto wait. The first arrival was a Paca, a reddish, nearly tail-less\r\nrodent, spotted with white on the sides, and intermediate in size and\r\nappearance between a hog and a hare. My first shot did not take effect;\r\nthe animal dived into the water and did not reappear. A second was\r\nbrought down by my companion as it was rambling about under the\r\nmangrove bushes. A Cutía next appeared: this is also a rodent, about\r\none-third the size of the Paca; it swims, but does not dive, and I was\r\nfortunate enough to shoot it. We obtained in this way two more Pacas\r\nand another Cutía. All the time the dogs were yelping in the forest.\r\nShortly afterwards Raimundo made his appearance, and told us to paddle\r\nto the other side of the island. Arrived there, we landed and prepared\r\nfor breakfast. It was a pretty spot—a clean, white, sandy beach beneath\r\nthe shade of wide-spreading trees. Joaquim made a fire. He first\r\nscraped fine shavings from the midrib of a Bacaba palm-leaf; these he\r\npiled into a little heap in a dry place, and then struck a light in his\r\nbamboo tinderbox with a piece of an old file and a flint, the tinder\r\nbeing a felt-like substance manufactured by an ant (Polyrhachis\r\nbispinosus). By gentle blowing, the shavings ignited, dry sticks were\r\npiled on them, and a good fire soon resulted. He then singed and\r\nprepared the cutía, finishing by running a spit through the body and\r\nfixing one end in the ground in a slanting position over the fire. We\r\nhad brought with us a bag of farinha and a cup containing a lemon, a\r\ndozen or two of fiery red peppers, and a few spoonsful of salt. We\r\nbreakfasted heartily when our cutía was roasted, and washed the meal\r\ndown with a calabash full of the pure water of the river.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the dogs found another cutia, which was hidden in its\r\nburrow two or three feet beneath the roots of a large tree, and it took\r\nRaimundo nearly an hour to disinter it. Soon afterwards we left this\r\nplace, crossed the channel, and, paddling past two islands, obtained a\r\nglimpse of the broad river between them, with a long sandy spit, on\r\nwhich stood several scarlet ibises and snow-white egrets. One of the\r\nislands was low and sandy, and half of it was covered with gigantic\r\narum-trees, the often-mentioned Caladium arborescens, which presented a\r\nstrange sight. Most people are acquainted with the little British\r\nspecies, Arum maculatum, which grows in hedge-bottoms, and many,\r\ndoubtless, have admired the larger kinds grown in hothouses; they can\r\ntherefore form some idea of a forest of arums. On this islet the woody\r\nstems of the plants near the bottom were eight to ten inches in\r\ndiameter, and the trees were twelve to fifteen feet high; all growing\r\ntogether in such a manner that there was just room for a man to walk\r\nfreely between them. There was a canoe inshore, with a man and a woman:\r\nthe man, who was hooting with all his might, told us in passing that\r\nhis son was lost in the “aningal” (arum-grove). He had strayed whilst\r\nwalking ashore, and the father had now been an hour waiting for him in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nAbout one o’clock we again stopped at the mouth of a little creek. It\r\nwas now intensely hot. Raimundo said deer were found here; so he\r\nborrowed my gun, as being a more effective weapon than the wretched\r\narms called Lazarinos, which he, in common with all the native hunters,\r\nused, and which sell at Pará for seven or eight shillings apiece.\r\nRaimundo and Joaquim now stripped themselves quite naked, and started\r\noff in different directions through the forest, going naked in order to\r\nmove with less noise over the carpet of dead leaves, amongst which they\r\nstepped so stealthily that not the slightest rustle could be heard. The\r\ndogs remained in the canoe, in the neighbourhood of which I employed\r\nmyself two hours entomologising. At the end of that time my two\r\ncompanions returned, having met with no game whatever.\r\n\r\nWe now embarked on our return voyage. Raimundo cut two slender poles,\r\none for a mast and the other for a sprit: to these he rigged a sail we\r\nhad brought in the boat, for we were to return by the open river, and\r\nexpected a good wind to carry us to Caripí. As soon as we got out of\r\nthe channel we began to feel the wind—the sea-breeze, which here makes\r\na clean sweep from the Atlantic. Our boat was very small and heavily\r\nladen; and when, after rounding a point, I saw the great breadth we had\r\nto traverse (seven miles), I thought the attempt to cross in such a\r\nslight vessel foolhardy in the extreme. The waves ran very high, there\r\nwas no rudder, Raimundo steered with a paddle, and all we had to rely\r\nupon to save us from falling into the trough of the sea and being\r\ninstantly swamped were his nerve and skill. There was just room in the\r\nboat for our three selves, the dogs, and the game we had killed, and\r\nwhen between the swelling ridges of waves in so frail a shell, our\r\ndestruction seemed inevitable; as it was, we shipped a little water now\r\nand then. Joaquim assisted with his paddle to steady the boat: my time\r\nwas fully occupied in bailing out the water and watching the dogs,\r\nwhich were crowded together in the prow, yelling with fear; one or\r\nother of them occasionally falling over the side and causing great\r\ncommotion in scrambling in again. Off the point was a ridge of rocks,\r\nover which the surge raged furiously. Raimundo sat at the stern, rigid\r\nand silent, his eye steadily watching the prow of the boat. It was\r\nalmost worth the risk and discomfort of the passage to witness the\r\nseamanlike ability displayed by Indians on the water. The little boat\r\nrode beautifully, rising well with each wave, and in the course of an\r\nhour and a half we arrived at Caripí, thoroughly tired and wet through\r\nto the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n1-8. Soldiers of different species of White Ants.—9. Ordinary shape of\r\nworker.—10. Winged class.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, the dry season came abruptly to an end. The\r\nsea-breezes, which had been increasing in force for some days, suddenly\r\nceased, and the atmosphere became misty; at length heavy clouds\r\ncollected where a uniform blue sky had for many weeks prevailed, and\r\ndown came a succession of heavy showers, the first of which lasted a\r\nwhole day and night. This seemed to give a new stimulus to animal life.\r\nOn the first night there was a tremendous uproar—tree-frogs, crickets,\r\ngoat-suckers, and owls all joining to perform a deafening concert. One\r\nkind of goat-sucker kept repeating at intervals throughout the night a\r\nphrase similar to the Portuguese words, “Joao corta pao,”—“John, cut\r\nwood”—a phrase which forms the Brazilian name of the bird. An owl in\r\none of the Genipapa trees muttered now and then a succession of\r\nsyllables resembling the word “Murucututú.” Sometimes the croaking and\r\nhooting of frogs and toads were so loud that we could not hear one\r\nanother’s voices within doors. Swarms of dragonflies appeared in the\r\ndaytime about the pools of water created by the rain, and ants and\r\ntermites came forth in the winged state in vast numbers. I noticed that\r\nthe winged termites, or white ants, which came by hundreds to the lamps\r\nat night, when alighting on the table, often jerked off their wings by\r\na voluntary movement. On examination I found that the wings were not\r\nshed by the roots, for a small portion of the stumps remained attached\r\nto the thorax. The edge of the fracture was in all cases straight, not\r\nruptured; there is, in fact, a natural seam crossing the member towards\r\nits root, and at this point the long wing naturally drops or is jerked\r\noff when the insect has no further use for it. The white ant is endowed\r\nwith wings simply for the purpose of flying away from the colony\r\npeopled by its wingless companions, to pair with individuals of the\r\nsame or other colonies, and thus propagate and disseminate its kind.\r\nThe winged individuals are males and females, whilst the great bulk of\r\ntheir wingless fraternity are of no sex, but are of two castes,\r\nsoldiers and workers, which are restricted to the functions of building\r\nthe nests, nursing, and defending the young brood. The two sexes mate\r\nwhilst on the ground, after the wings are shed; and then the married\r\ncouples, if they escape the numerous enemies which lie in wait for\r\nthem, proceed to the task of founding new colonies. Ants and white ants\r\nhave much that is analogous in their modes of life: they belong,\r\nhowever, to two widely different orders of insects, strongly contrasted\r\nin their structure and manner of growth.\r\n\r\nI amassed at Caripí a very large collection of beautiful and curious\r\ninsects, amounting altogether to about twelve hundred species. The\r\nnumber of Coleoptera was remarkable, seeing that this order is so\r\npoorly represented near Pará. I attributed their abundance to the\r\nnumber of new clearings made in the virgin forest by the native\r\nsettlers. The felled timber attracts lignivorous insects, and these\r\ndraw in their train the predaceous species of various families. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the species were smaller and much less brilliant in\r\ncolours than those of Mexico and South Brazil. The species too,\r\nalthough numerous, were not represented by great numbers of\r\nindividuals; they were also extremely nimble, and therefore much less\r\neasy of capture than insects of the same order in temperate climates.\r\nThe carnivorous beetles at Caripí were, like those of Pará, chiefly\r\narboreal. Most of them exhibited a beautiful contrivance for enabling\r\nthem to cling to and run over smooth or flexible surfaces, such as\r\nleaves. Their tarsi or feet are broad, and furnished beneath with a\r\nbrush of short stiff hairs; whilst their claws are toothed in the form\r\nof a comb, adapting them for clinging to the smooth edges of leaves,\r\nthe joint of the foot which precedes the claw being cleft so as to\r\nallow free play to the claw in grasping. The common dung-beetles at\r\nCaripí, which flew about in the evening like the Geotrupes, the\r\nfamiliar “shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hum” of our English lanes,\r\nwere of colossal size and beautiful colours. One kind had a long\r\nspear-shaped horn projecting from the crown of its head (Phanæus\r\nlancifer). A blow from this fellow, as he came heavily flying along,\r\nwas never very pleasant. All the tribes of beetles which feed on\r\nvegetable substances, fresh or decayed, were very numerous. The most\r\nbeautiful of these, but not the most common, were the Longicornes; very\r\ngraceful insects, having slender bodies and long antennæ, often\r\nornamented with fringes and tufts of hair. They were found on flowers,\r\non trunks of trees, or flying about the new clearings. One small\r\nspecies (Coremia hirtipes) has a tuft of hairs on its hind legs, whilst\r\nmany of its sister species have a similar ornament on the antennæ. It\r\nsuggests curious reflections when we see an ornament like the feather\r\nof a grenadier’s cap situated on one part of the body in one species,\r\nand in a totally different part in nearly allied ones. I tried in vain\r\nto discover the use of these curious brush-like decorations. On the\r\ntrunk of a living leguminous tree, Petzell found a number of a very\r\nrare and handsome species, the Platysternus hebræus, which is of a\r\nbroad shape, coloured ochreous, but spotted and striped with black, so\r\nas to resemble a domino. On the felled trunks of trees, swarms of\r\ngilded-green Longicornes occurred, of small size (Chrysoprasis), which\r\nlooked like miniature musk-beetles, and, indeed, are closely allied to\r\nthose well-known European insects.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 12th of February, I left Caripí, my Negro and Indian\r\nneighbours bidding me a warm “adios.” I had passed a delightful time,\r\nnotwithstanding the many privations undergone in the way of food. The\r\nwet season had now set in; the lowlands and islands would soon become\r\nflooded daily at high water, and the difficulty of obtaining fresh\r\nprovisions would increase. I intended, therefore, to spend the next\r\nthree months at Pará, in the neighbourhood of which there was still\r\nmuch to be done in the intervals of fine weather, and then start off on\r\nanother excursion into the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\nTHE LOWER AMAZONS—PARÁ TO OBYDOS\r\n\r\n\r\nModes of Travelling on the Amazons — Historical Sketch of the Early\r\nExplorations of the River — Preparations for Voyage — Life on Board a\r\nLarge Trading Vessel — The narrow channels joining the Pará to the\r\nAmazons — First Sight of the Great River — Gurupa — The Great Shoal —\r\nFlat-topped Mountains — Santarem — Obydos\r\n\r\nAt the time of my first voyage up the Amazons—namely, in 1849—nearly\r\nall communication with the interior was by means of small\r\nsailing-vessels, owned by traders residing in the remote towns and\r\nvillages, who seldom came to Pará themselves, but entrusted vessels and\r\ncargoes to the care of half-breeds or Portuguese cabos. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, they risked all in the hands of the Indian crew, making the\r\npilot, who was also steersman, do duty as supercargo. Now and then,\r\nPortuguese and Brazilian merchants at Pará furnished young Portuguese\r\nwith merchandise, and dispatched them to the interior to exchange the\r\ngoods for produce amongst the scattered population. The means of\r\ncommunication, in fact, with the upper parts of the Amazons had been on\r\nthe decline for some time, on account of the augmented difficulty of\r\nobtaining hands to navigate vessels. Formerly, when the Government\r\nwished to send any important functionary, such as a judge or a military\r\ncommandant, into the interior, they equipped a swift-sailing galliota\r\nmanned with ten or a dozen Indians. These could travel, on the average,\r\nin one day farther than the ordinary sailing craft could in three.\r\nIndian paddlers were now, however, almost impossible to be obtained,\r\nand Government officers were obliged to travel as passengers in\r\ntrading-vessels. The voyage made in this way was tedious in the\r\nextreme. When the regular east-wind blew—the “vento geral,” or\r\ntrade-wind of the Amazons—sailing-vessels could get along very well;\r\nbut when this failed, they were obliged to remain, sometimes many days\r\ntogether, anchored near the shore, or progress laboriously by means of\r\nthe “espia.” The latter mode of travelling was as follows. The\r\nmontaria, with twenty or thirty fathoms of cable, one end of which was\r\nattached to the foremast, was sent ahead with a couple of hands, who\r\nsecured the other end of the rope to some strong bough or tree-trunk;\r\nthe crew then hauled the vessel up to the point, after which the men in\r\nthe boat re-embarked the cable, and paddled forwards to repeat the\r\nprocess. In the dry season, from August to December, when the\r\ntrade-wind is strong and the currents slack, a schooner could reach the\r\nmouth of the Rio Negro, a thousand miles from Pará, in about forty\r\ndays; but in the wet season, from January to July, when the east-wind\r\nno longer blows and the Amazons pours forth its full volume of water,\r\nflooding the banks and producing a tearing current, it took three\r\nmonths to travel the same distance. It was a great blessing to the\r\ninhabitants when, in 1853, a line of steamers was established, and this\r\nsame journey could be accomplished with ease and comfort, at all\r\nseasons, in eight days!\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not generally known that the Portuguese, as early as\r\n1710, had a fair knowledge of the Amazons; but the information gathered\r\nby their Government, from various expeditions undertaken on a grand\r\nscale, was long withheld from the rest of the world, through the\r\njealous policy which ruled in their colonial affairs. From the\r\nfoundation of Pará by Caldeira, in 1615, to the settlement of the\r\nboundary line between the Spanish and Portuguese possessions, Peru and\r\nBrazil, in 1781-91, numbers of these expeditions were undertaken in\r\nsuccession. The largest was the one commanded by Pedro Texeira in\r\n1637-9, who ascended the river to Quito by way of the Napo, a distance\r\nof about 2800 miles, with 45 canoes and 900 men, and returned to Pará\r\nwithout any great misadventure by the same route. The success of this\r\nremarkable undertaking amply proved, at that early date, the facility\r\nof the river navigation, the practicability of the country, and the\r\ngood disposition of the aboriginal inhabitants. The river, however, was\r\nfirst discovered by the Spaniards, the mouth having been visited by\r\nPinzon in 1500, and nearly the whole course of the river navigated by\r\nOrellana in 1541-2. The voyage of the latter was one of the most\r\nremarkable on record. Orellana was a lieutenant of Gonzalo Pizarro,\r\nGovernor of Quito, and accompanied the latter in an adventurous journey\r\nwhich he undertook across the easternmost chain of the Andes, down into\r\nthe sweltering valley of the Napo, in search of the land of El Dorado,\r\nor the Gilded King. They started with 300 soldiers and 4000 Indian\r\nporters; but, arrived on the banks of one of the tributaries of the\r\nNapo, their followers were so greatly decreased in number by disease\r\nand hunger, and the remainder so much weakened, that Pizarro was\r\nobliged to despatch Orellana with fifty men, in a vessel they had\r\nbuilt, to the Napo, in search of provisions. It can be imagined by\r\nthose acquainted with the Amazons country how fruitless this errand\r\nwould be in the wilderness of forest where Orellana and his followers\r\nfound themselves when they reached the Napo, and how strong their\r\ndisinclination would be to return against the currents and rapids which\r\nthey had descended. The idea then seized them to commit themselves to\r\nthe chances of the stream, although ignorant whither it would lead. So\r\nonward they went. From the Napo they emerged into the main Amazons,\r\nand, after many and various adventures with the Indians on its banks,\r\nreached the Atlantic— eight months from the date of their entering the\r\ngreat river.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] It was during this voyage that the nation of female warriors was\r\n said to have been met with; a report which gave rise to the Portuguese\r\n name of the river, Amazonas. It is now pretty well known that this is\r\n a mere fable, originating in the love of the marvellous which\r\n distinguished the early Spanish adventurers, and impaired the\r\n credibility of their narratives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable voyage was accomplished, in a similar manner, by a\r\nSpaniard named Lopez d’Aguirre, from Cusco, in Peru, down the Ucayali,\r\na branch of the Amazons flowing from the south, and therefore, from an\r\nopposite direction to that of the Napo. An account of this journey was\r\nsent by D’Aguirre, in a letter to the King of Spain, from which\r\nHumboldt has given an extract in his narrative. As it is a good\r\nspecimen of the quaintness of style and looseness of statement\r\nexhibited by these early narrators of adventures in South America, I\r\nwill give a translation of it: “We constructed rafts, and, leaving\r\nbehind our horses and baggage, sailed down the river (the Ucayali) with\r\ngreat risk, until we found ourselves in a gulf of fresh water. In this\r\nriver Maranon we continued more than ten months and a half, down to its\r\nmouth, where it falls into the sea. We made one hundred days’ journey,\r\nand travelled 1500 leagues. It is a great and fearful stream, has 80\r\nleagues of fresh water at its mouth, vast shoals, and 800 leagues of\r\nwilderness without any kind of inhabitants,[2] as your Majesty will see\r\nfrom the true and correct narrative of the journey which we have made.\r\nIt has more than 6000 islands. God knows how we came out of this\r\nfearful sea!” Many expeditions were undertaken in the course of the\r\neighteenth century; in fact, the crossing of the continent from the\r\nPacific to the Atlantic, by way of the Amazons, seems to have become by\r\nthis time a common occurrence. The only voyage, however, which yielded\r\nmuch scientific information to the European public was that of the\r\nFrench astronomer, La Condamine, in 1743-4. The most complete account\r\nyet published of the river is that given by Von Martius in the third\r\nvolume of Spix and Martius’ Travels. These most accomplished travellers\r\nwere eleven months in the country—namely, from July, 1819, to June,\r\n1820—and ascended the river to the frontiers of the Brazilian\r\nterritory. The accounts they have given of the geography, ethnology,\r\nbotany, history, and statistics of the Amazons region are the most\r\ncomplete that have ever been given to the world. Their narrative was\r\nnot published until 1831, and was unfortunately inaccessible to me\r\nduring the time I travelled in the same country.\r\n\r\n [2] This account disagrees with that of Acunna, the historiographer of\r\n Texeira’s expedition, who accompanied him, in 1639, on his return\r\n voyage from Quito. Acunna speaks of a very numerous population on the\r\n banks of the Amazons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst preparing for my voyage it happened, fortunately, that the\r\nhalf-brother of Dr. Angelo Custodio, a young mestizo named Joao da\r\nCunha Correia, was about to start for the Amazons on a trading\r\nexpedition in his own vessel, a schooner of about forty tons’ burthen.\r\nA passage for me was soon arranged with him through the intervention of\r\nDr. Angelo, and we started on the 5th of September, 1849. I intended to\r\nstop at some village on the northern shore of the Lower Amazons, where\r\nit would be interesting to make collections, in order to show the\r\nrelations of the fauna to those of Pará and the coast region of Guiana.\r\nAs I should have to hire a house or hut wherever I stayed, I took all\r\nthe materials for housekeeping—cooking utensils, crockery, and so\r\nforth. To these were added a stock of such provisions as it would be\r\ndifficult to obtain in the interior; also ammunition, chests,\r\nstore-boxes, a small library of natural history books, and a\r\nhundredweight of copper money. I engaged, after some trouble, a\r\nMameluco youth to accompany me as servant—a short, fat, yellow-faced\r\nboy named Luco, whom I had already employed at Pará in collecting. We\r\nweighed anchor at night, and on the following day found ourselves\r\ngliding along the dark-brown waters of the Mojú.\r\n\r\nJoao da Cunha, like most of his fellow countrymen, took matters very\r\neasily. He was going to be absent in the interior several years, and\r\ntherefore, intended to diverge from his route to visit his native\r\nplace, Cametá, and spend a few days with his friends. It seemed not to\r\nmatter to him that he had a cargo of merchandise, vessel, and crew of\r\ntwelve persons, which required an economical use of time; “pleasure\r\nfirst and business afterwards” appeared to be his maxim. We stayed at\r\nCametá twelve days. The chief motive for prolonging the stay to this\r\nextent was a festival at the Aldeia, two miles below Cametá, which was\r\nto commence on the 21st, and which my friend wished to take part in. On\r\nthe day of the festival the schooner was sent down to anchor off the\r\nAldeia, and master and men gave themselves up to revelry. In the\r\nevening a strong breeze sprang up, and orders were given to embark. We\r\nscrambled down in the dark through the thickets of cacao, orange, and\r\ncoffee trees which clothed the high bank, and, after running great risk\r\nof being swamped by the heavy sea in the crowded montaria, got all\r\naboard by nine o’clock. We made all sail amidst the “adios” shouted to\r\nus by Indian and mulatto sweethearts from the top of the bank, and,\r\ntide and wind being favourable, were soon miles away.\r\n\r\nOur crew consisted, as already mentioned, of twelve persons. One was a\r\nyoung Portuguese from the province of Traz os Montes, a pretty sample\r\nof the kind of emigrants which Portugal sends to Brazil. He was two or\r\nthree and twenty years of age, and had been about two years in the\r\ncountry, dressing and living like the Indians, to whom he was certainly\r\ninferior in manners. He could not read or write, whereas one at least\r\nof our Tapuyos had both accomplishments. He had a little wooden image\r\nof Nossa Senhora in his rough wooden clothes-chest, and to this he\r\nalways had recourse when any squall arose, or when we ran aground on a\r\nshoal. Another of our sailors was a tawny white of Cametá; the rest\r\nwere Indians, except the cook, who was a Cafuzo, or half-breed between\r\nthe Indian and negro. It is often said that this class of mestizos is\r\nthe most evilly-disposed of all the numerous crosses between the races\r\ninhabiting Brazil; but Luiz was a simple, good-hearted fellow, always\r\nready to do one a service. The pilot was an old Tapuyo of Pará, with\r\nregular oval face and well-shaped features. I was astonished at his\r\nendurance. He never quitted the helm night or day, except for two or\r\nthree hours in the morning. The other Indians used to bring him his\r\ncoffee and meals, and after breakfast one of them relieved him for a\r\ntime, when he used to lie down on the quarterdeck and get his two\r\nhours’ nap. The Indians forward had things pretty much their own way.\r\nNo system of watches was followed; when any one was so disposed, he lay\r\ndown on the deck and went to sleep; but a feeling of good fellowship\r\nseemed always to exist amongst them. One of them was a fine specimen of\r\nthe Indian race—a man just short of six feet high, with remarkable\r\nbreadth of shoulder and full muscular chest. His comrades called him\r\nthe commandant, on account of his having been one of the rebel leaders\r\nwhen the Indians and others took Santarem in 1835. They related of him\r\nthat, when the legal authorities arrived with an armed flotilla to\r\nrecapture the town, he was one of the last to quit, remaining in the\r\nlittle fortress which commands the place to make a show of loading the\r\nguns, although the ammunition had given out long ago. Such were our\r\ntravelling companions. We lived almost the same as on board ship. Our\r\nmeals were cooked in the galley; but, where practicable, and during our\r\nnumerous stoppages, the men went in the montaria to fish near the\r\nshore, so that our breakfasts and dinners of salt pirarucu were\r\nsometimes varied with fresh food.\r\n\r\n_September 24th._—We passed Entre-as-Ilhas with the morning tide\r\nyesterday, and then made across to the eastern shore—the starting-point\r\nfor all canoes which have to traverse the broad mouth of the Tocantins\r\ngoing west. Early this morning we commenced the passage. The navigation\r\nis attended with danger on account of the extensive shoals in the\r\nmiddle of the river, which are covered only by a small depth of water\r\nat this season of the year. The wind was fresh, and the schooner rolled\r\nand pitched like a ship at sea. The distance was about fifteen miles.\r\nIn the middle, the river-view was very imposing. Towards the northeast\r\nthere was a long sweep of horizon clear of land, and on the southwest\r\nstretched a similar boundless expanse, but varied with islets clothed\r\nwith fan-leaved palms, which, however, were visible only as isolated\r\ngroups of columns, tufted at the top, rising here and there amidst the\r\nwaste of waters. In the afternoon we rounded the westernmost point; the\r\nland, which is not terra firma, but simply a group of large islands\r\nforming a portion of the Tocantins delta, was then about three miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nOn the following day (25th) we sailed towards the west, along the upper\r\nportion of the Pará estuary, which extends seventy miles beyond the\r\nmouth of the Tocantins. It varies in width from three to five miles,\r\nbut broadens rapidly near its termination, where it is eight or nine\r\nmiles wide. The northern shore is formed by the island of Marajó, and\r\nis slightly elevated and rocky in some parts. A series of islands\r\nconceals the southern shore from view most of the way. The whole\r\ncountry, mainland and islands, is covered with forest. We had a good\r\nwind all day, and about 7 p.m. entered the narrow river of Breves,\r\nwhich commences abruptly the extensive labyrinth of channels that\r\nconnects the Pará with the Amazons. The sudden termination of the Pará\r\nat a point where it expands to so great a breadth is remarkable; the\r\nwater, however, is very shallow over the greater portion of the\r\nexpanse. I noticed both on this and on the three subsequent occasions\r\nof passing this place in ascending and descending the river, that the\r\nflow of the tide from the east along the estuary, as well as up the\r\nBreves, was very strong. This seems sufficient to prove that no\r\nconsiderable volume of water passes by this medium from the Amazons to\r\nthe Pará, and that the opinion of those geographers is an incorrect\r\none, who believe the Pará to be one of the mouths of the great river.\r\nThere is, however, another channel connecting the two rivers, which\r\nenters the Pará six miles to the south of the Breves. The lower part of\r\nits course for eighteen miles is formed by the Uanapú, a large and\r\nindependent river flowing from the south. The tidal flow is said by the\r\nnatives to produce little or no current up this river—a fact which\r\nseems to afford a little support to the view just stated.\r\n\r\nWe passed the village of Breves at 3 p.m. on the 26th. It consists of\r\nabout forty houses, most of which are occupied by Portuguese\r\nshopkeepers. A few Indian families reside here, who occupy themselves\r\nwith the manufacture of ornamental pottery and painted cuyas, which\r\nthey sell to traders or passing travellers. The cuyas—drinking-cups\r\nmade from gourds—are sometimes very tastefully painted. The rich black\r\nground-colour is produced by a dye made from the bark of a tree called\r\nComateu, the gummy nature of which imparts a fine polish. The yellow\r\ntints are made with the Tabatinga clay; the red with the seeds of the\r\nUrucu, or anatto plant; and the blue with indigo, which is planted\r\nround the huts. The art is indigenous with the Amazonian Indians, but\r\nit is only the settled agricultural tribes belonging to the Tupí stock\r\nwho practise it.\r\n\r\n_September 27th-30th._—After passing Breves, we continued our way\r\nslowly along a channel, or series of channels, of variable width. On\r\nthe morning of the 27th we had a fair wind, the breadth of the stream\r\nvarying from about 150 to 400 yards. About midday we passed, on the\r\nwestern side, the mouth of the Aturiazal, through which, on account of\r\nits swifter current, vessels pass in descending from the Amazons to\r\nPará. Shortly afterwards we entered the narrow channel of the Jaburú,\r\nwhich lies twenty miles above the mouth of the Breves. Here commences\r\nthe peculiar scenery of this remarkable region. We found ourselves in a\r\nnarrow and nearly straight canal, not more than eighty to a hundred\r\nyards in width, and hemmed in by two walls of forest, which rose quite\r\nperpendicularly from the water to a height of seventy or eighty feet.\r\nThe water was of great and uniform depth, even close to the banks. We\r\nseemed to be in a deep gorge, and the strange impression the place\r\nproduced was augmented by the dull echoes wakened by the voices of our\r\nIndians and the splash of their paddles. The forest was excessively\r\nvaried. Some of the trees, the dome-topped giants of the Leguminous and\r\nBombaceous orders, reared their heads far above the average height of\r\nthe green walls. The fan-leaved Mirití palm was scattered in some\r\nnumbers amidst the rest, a few solitary specimens shooting up their\r\nsmooth columns above the other trees. The graceful Assai palm grew in\r\nlittle groups, forming feathery pictures set in the rounder foliage of\r\nthe mass. The Ubussú, lower in height, showed only its shuttlecock\r\nshaped crowns of huge undivided fronds, which, being of a vivid\r\npale-green, contrasted forcibly against the sombre hues of the\r\nsurrounding foliage. The Ubussú grew here in great numbers; the equally\r\nremarkable Jupati palm (Rhaphia taedigera), which, like the Ubussú, is\r\npeculiar to this district, occurred more sparsely, throwing its long\r\nshaggy leaves, forty to fifty feet in length, in broad arches over the\r\ncanal. An infinite diversity of smaller-sized palms decorated the\r\nwater’s edge, such as the Marajá-i (Bactris, many species), the Ubim\r\n(Geonoma), and a few stately Bacábas (Œnocarpus Bacaba). The shape of\r\nthis last is exceedingly elegant, the size of the crown being in proper\r\nproportion to the straight smooth stem. The leaves, down even to the\r\nbases of the glossy petioles, are of a rich dark-green colour, and free\r\nfrom spines. “The forest wall”—I am extracting from my journal—“under\r\nwhich we are now moving, consists, besides palms, of a great variety of\r\nordinary forest trees. From the highest branches of these down to the\r\nwater sweep ribbons of climbing plants of the most diverse and\r\nornamental foliage possible. Creeping convolvuli and others have made\r\nuse of the slender lianas and hanging air roots as ladders to climb by.\r\nNow and then appears a Mimosa or other tree having similar fine pinnate\r\nfoliage, and thick masses of Ingá border the water, from whose branches\r\nhang long bean-pods, of different shape and size according to the\r\nspecies, some of them a yard in length. Flowers there are very few. I\r\nsee, now and then, a gorgeous crimson blossom on long spikes\r\nornamenting the sombre foliage towards the summits of the forest. I\r\nsuppose it to belong to a climber of the Combretaceous order. There are\r\nalso a few yellow and violet Trumpet-flowers (Bignoniæ). The blossoms\r\nof the Ingás, although not conspicuous, are delicately beautiful. The\r\nforest all along offers so dense a front that one never obtains a\r\nglimpse into the interior of the wilderness.”\r\n\r\nThe length of the Jaburú channel is about thirty-five miles, allowing\r\nfor the numerous abrupt bends which occur between the middle and the\r\nnorthern end of its course. We were three days and a half accomplishing\r\nthe passage. The banks on each side seemed to be composed of hard\r\nriver-mud with a thick covering of vegetable mold, so that I should\r\nimagine this whole district originated in a gradual accumulation of\r\nalluvium, through which the endless labyrinths of channels have worked\r\ntheir deep and narrow beds. The flood-tide as we travelled northward\r\nbecame gradually of less assistance to us, as it caused only a feeble\r\ncurrent upwards. The pressure of the waters from the Amazons here makes\r\nitself felt: as this is not the case lower down, I suppose the currents\r\nare diverted through some of the numerous channels which we passed on\r\nour right, and which traverse, in their course towards the sea, the\r\nnorth-western part of Maraj&o†. In the evening of the 29th we arrived\r\nat a point where another channel joins the Jaburú from the north-east.\r\nUp this the tide was flowing; we turned westward, and thus met the\r\nflood coming from the Amazons. This point is the object of a strange\r\nsuperstitious observance on the part of the canoemen. It is said to be\r\nhaunted by a Pajé, or Indian wizard, whom it is necessary to propitiate\r\nby depositing some article on the spot, if the voyager wishes to secure\r\na safe return from the “sertaô,” as the interior of the country is\r\ncalled. The trees were all hung with rags, shirts, straw hats, bunches\r\nof fruit, and so forth. Although the superstition doubtless originated\r\nwith the aborigines, I observed in both my voyages, that it was only\r\nthe Portuguese and uneducated Brazilians who deposited anything. The\r\npure Indians gave nothing, and treated the whole affair as a humbug;\r\nbut they were all civilised Tapuyos.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, at 9 p.m., we reached a broad channel called Macaco, and\r\nnow left the dark, echoing Jaburú. The Macaco sends off branches\r\ntowards the north-west coast of Marajó. It is merely a passage amongst\r\na cluster of islands, between which a glimpse is occasionally obtained\r\nof the broad waters of the main Amazons. A brisk wind carried us\r\nrapidly past its monotonous scenery, and early in the morning of the\r\n1st of October we reached the entrance of the Uituquara, or the\r\nWind-hole, which is fifteen miles distant from the end of the Jaburú.\r\nThis is also a winding channel, thirty-five miles in length, threading\r\na group of islands, but it is much narrower than the Macaco.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcari Fish (Loricaria duodecimalis).\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the Uituquára on the 2nd, we all went ashore—the men\r\nto fish in a small creek; Joao da Cunha and I to shoot birds. We saw a\r\nflock of scarlet and blue macaws (Macrocercus Macao) feeding on the\r\nfruits of a Bacába palm, and looking like a cluster of flaunting\r\nbanners beneath its dark-green crown. We landed about fifty yards from\r\nthe place, and crept cautiously through the forest, but before we\r\nreached them they flew off with loud harsh screams. At a wild fruit\r\ntree we were more successful, as my companion shot an anacá (Derotypus\r\ncoronatus), one of the most beautiful of the parrot family. It is of a\r\ngreen colour, and has a hood of feathers, red bordered with blue, at\r\nthe back of its head, which it can elevate or depress at pleasure. The\r\nanacá is the only new-world parrot which nearly resembles the cockatoo\r\nof Australia. It is found in all the lowlands throughout the Amazons\r\nregion, but is not a common bird anywhere. Few persons succeed in\r\ntaming it, and I never saw one that had been taught to speak. The\r\nnatives are very fond of the bird nevertheless, and keep it in their\r\nhouses for the sake of seeing the irascible creature expand its\r\nbeautiful frill of feathers, which it readily does when excited. The\r\nmen returned with a large quantity of fish. I was surprised at the\r\ngreat variety of species; the prevailing kind was a species of\r\nLoricaria, a foot in length, and wholly encased in bony armour. It\r\nabounds at certain seasons in shallow water. The flesh is dry, but very\r\npalatable. They brought also a small alligator, which they called\r\nJacare curua, and said it was a kind found only in shallow creeks. It\r\nwas not more than two feet in length, although full-grown according to\r\nthe statement of the Indians, who said it was a “mai d’ovos,” or mother\r\nof eggs, as they had pillaged the nest, which they had found near the\r\nedge of the water. The eggs were rather larger than a hen’s, and\r\nregularly oval in shape, presenting a rough hard surface of shell.\r\nUnfortunately, the alligator was cut up ready for cooking when we\r\nreturned to the schooner, and I could not therefore make a note of its\r\npeculiarities. The pieces were skewered and roasted over the fire, each\r\nman being his own cook. I never saw this species of alligator\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n_October 3rd._—About midnight the wind, for which we had long been\r\nwaiting, sprang up; the men weighed anchor, and we were soon fairly\r\nembarked on the Amazons. I rose long before sunrise to see the great\r\nriver by moonlight. There was a spanking breeze, and the vessel was\r\nbounding gaily over the waters. The channel along which we were sailing\r\nwas only a narrow arm of the river, about two miles in width: the total\r\nbreadth at this point is more than twenty miles, but the stream is\r\ndivided into three parts by a series of large islands. The river,\r\nnotwithstanding this limitation of its breadth, had a most majestic\r\nappearance. It did not present that lake-like aspect which the waters\r\nof the Pará and Tocantins affect, but had all the swing, so to speak,\r\nof a vast flowing stream. The ochre-coloured turbid waters offered also\r\na great contrast to the rivers belonging to the Pará system. The\r\nchannel formed a splendid reach, sweeping from south-west to\r\nnorth-east, with a horizon of water and sky both upstream and down. At\r\n11 a.m. we arrived at Gurupá, a small village situated on a rocky bank\r\nthirty or forty feet high. Here we landed, and I had an opportunity of\r\nrambling in the neighbouring woods, which are intersected by numerous\r\npathways, and carpeted with Lycopodia growing to a height of eight or\r\nten inches, and enlivened by numbers of glossy blue butterflies of the\r\nTheclidæ or hairstreak family. At 5 p.m. we were again under way. Soon\r\nafter sunset, as we were crossing the mouth of the Xingú, the first of\r\nthe great tributaries of the Amazons, 1200 miles in length, a black\r\ncloud arose suddenly in the northeast. Joao da Cunha ordered all sails\r\nto be taken in, and immediately afterwards a furious squall burst\r\nforth, tearing the waters into foam, and producing a frightful uproar\r\nin the neighbouring forests. A drenching rain followed, but in half an\r\nhour all was again calm and the full moon appeared sailing in a\r\ncloudless sky.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Xingú the route followed by vessels leads\r\nstraight across the river, here ten miles broad. Towards midnight the\r\nwind failed us, when we were close to a large shoal called the Baixo\r\nGrande. We lay here becalmed in the sickening heat for two days, and\r\nwhen the trade-wind recommenced with the rising moon at 10 p.m. on the\r\n6th, we found ourselves on a lee-shore. Notwithstanding all the efforts\r\nof our pilot to avoid it, we ran aground. Fortunately the bottom\r\nconsisted only of soft mud, so that by casting anchor to windward, and\r\nhauling in with the whole strength of crew and passengers, we got off\r\nafter spending an uncomfortable night. We rounded the point of the\r\nshoal in two fathoms’ water; the head of the vessel was then put\r\nwestward, and by sunrise we were bounding forward before a steady\r\nbreeze, all sail set and everybody in good humour.\r\n\r\nThe weather was now delightful for several days in succession, the air\r\ntransparently clear, and the breeze cool and invigorating. At daylight,\r\non the 6th, a chain of blue hills, the Serra de Almeyrim, appeared in\r\nthe distance on the north bank of the river. The sight was most\r\nexhilarating after so long a sojourn in a flat country. We kept to the\r\nsouthern shore, passing in the course of the day the mouths of the\r\nUrucuricáya and the Aquiquí, two channels which communicate with the\r\nXingú. The whole of this southern coast hence to near Santarem, a\r\ndistance of 130 miles, is lowland and quite uninhabited. It is\r\nintersected by short arms or back waters of the Amazons, which are\r\ncalled in the Tupi language Parána-mirims, or little rivers. By keeping\r\nto these, small canoes can travel a great part of the distance without\r\nbeing much exposed to the heavy seas of the main river. The coast\r\nthroughout has a most desolate aspect; the forest is not so varied as\r\non the higher land; and the water-frontage, which is destitute of the\r\ngreen mantle of climbing plants that form so rich a decoration in other\r\nparts, is encumbered at every step with piles of fallen trees; and\r\npeopled by white egrets, ghostly storks, and solitary herons. In the\r\nevening we passed Almeyrim. The hills, according to Von Martius, who\r\nlanded here, are about 800 feet above the level of the river, and are\r\nthickly wooded to the summit. They commence on the east by a few low\r\nisolated and rounded elevations; but towards the west of the village,\r\nthey assume the appearance of elongated ridges which seem as if they\r\nhad been planed down to a uniform height by some external force. The\r\nnext day we passed in succession a series of similar flat-topped hills,\r\nsome isolated and of a truncated-pyramidal shape, others prolonged to a\r\nlength of several miles. There is an interval of low country between\r\nthese and the Almeyrim range, which has a total length of about\r\ntwenty-five miles; then commences abruptly the Serra de Marauaqua,\r\nwhich is succeeded in a similar way by the Velha Pobre range, the\r\nSerras de Tapaiuna-quára, and Parauá-quára. All these form a striking\r\ncontrast to the Serra de Almeyrim in being quite destitute of trees.\r\nThey have steep rugged sides, apparently clothed with short herbage,\r\nbut here and there exposing bare white patches. Their total length is\r\nabout forty miles. In the rear, towards the interior, they are\r\nsucceeded by other ranges of hills communicating with the central\r\nmountain-chain of Guiana, which divides Brazil from Cayenne.\r\n\r\nAs we sailed along the southern shore, during the 6th and two following\r\ndays, the table-topped hills on the opposite side occupied most of our\r\nattention. The river is from four to five miles broad, and in some\r\nplaces long, low wooded islands intervene in mid-stream, whose\r\nlight-green, vivid verdure formed a strangely beautiful foreground to\r\nthe glorious landscape of broad stream and grey mountain. Ninety miles\r\nbeyond Almeyrim stands the village of Monte Alegre, which is built near\r\nthe summit of the last hill visible of this chain. At this point the\r\nriver bends a little towards the south, and the hilly country recedes\r\nfrom its shores to re-appear at Obydos, greatly decreased in height,\r\nabout a hundred miles further west.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlat-topped mountains of Paraua-quara, lower Amazons.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river three times between Monte Alegre and the next\r\ntown, Santarem. In the middle the waves ran very high, and the vessel\r\nlurched fearfully, hurling everything that was not well secured from\r\none side of the deck to the other. On the morning of the 9th of\r\nOctober, a gentle wind carried us along a “remanso,” or still water,\r\nunder the southern shore. These tracts of quiet water are frequent on\r\nthe irregular sides of the stream, and are the effect of counter\r\nmovements caused by the rapid current of its central parts. At 9 a.m.\r\nwe passed the mouth of a Paraná-mirim, called Mahicá, and then found a\r\nsudden change in the colour of the water and aspect of the banks.\r\nInstead of the low and swampy water-frontage which had prevailed from\r\nthe mouth of the Xingú, we saw before us a broad sloping beach of white\r\nsand. The forest, instead of being an entangled mass of irregular and\r\nrank vegetation as hitherto, presented a rounded outline, and created\r\nan impresssion of repose that was very pleasing. We now approached, in\r\nfact, the mouth of the Tapajos, whose clear olive-green waters here\r\nreplaced the muddy current against which we had so long been sailing.\r\nAlthough this is a river of great extent—1000 miles in length, and, for\r\nthe last eighty miles of its course, four to ten in breadth—its\r\ncontribution to the Amazons is not perceptible in the middle of the\r\nstream. The white turbid current of the main river flows disdainfully\r\nby, occupying nearly the whole breadth of the channel, whilst the\r\ndarker water of its tributary seems to creep along the shore, and is no\r\nlonger distinguishable four or five miles from its mouth.\r\n\r\nWe reached Santarem at 11 a.m. The town has a clean and cheerful\r\nappearance from the river. It consists of three long streets, with a\r\nfew short ones crossing them at right angles, and contains about 2500\r\ninhabitants. It lies just within the mouth of Tapajos, and is divided\r\ninto two parts, the town and the aldeia or village. The houses of the\r\nwhite and trading classes are substantially built, many being of two\r\nand three stories, and all white-washed and tiled. The aldeia, which\r\ncontains the Indian portion of the population, or did so formerly,\r\nconsists mostly of mud huts, thatched with palm leaves. The situation\r\nof the town is very beautiful. The land, although but slightly\r\nelevated, does not form, strictly speaking, a portion of the alluvial\r\nriver plains of the Amazons, but is rather a northern prolongation of\r\nthe Brazilian continental land. It is scantily wooded, and towards the\r\ninterior consists of undulating campos, which are connected with a\r\nseries of hills extending southward as far as the eye can reach. I\r\nsubsequently made this place my head-quarters for three years; an\r\naccount of its neighbourhood is therefore, reserved for another\r\nchapter. At the first sight of Santarem, one cannot help being struck\r\nwith the advantages of its situation. Although 400 miles from the sea,\r\nit is accessible to vessels of heavy tonnage coming straight from the\r\nAtlantic. The river has only two slight bends between this port and the\r\nsea, and for five or six months in the year the Amazonian trade wind\r\nblows with very little interruption, so that sailing ships coming from\r\nforeign countries could reach the place with little difficulty. We\r\nourselves had accomplished 200 miles, or about half the distance from\r\nthe sea, in an ill-rigged vessel, in three days and a half. Although\r\nthe land in the immediate neighbourhood is perhaps ill adapted for\r\nagriculture, an immense tract of rich soil, with forest and meadowland,\r\nlies on the opposite banks of the river, and the Tapajos leads into the\r\nheart of the mining provinces of interior Brazil. But where is the\r\npopulation to come from to develop the resources of this fine country?\r\nAt present, the district within a radius of twenty-five miles contains\r\nbarely 6500 inhabitants; behind the town, towards the interior, the\r\ncountry is uninhabited, and jaguars roam nightly, at least in the rainy\r\nseason, close up to the ends of the suburban streets.\r\n\r\nFrom information obtained here, I fixed upon the next town, Obydos, as\r\nthe best place to stay for a few weeks, in order to investigate the\r\nnatural productions of the north side of the Lower Amazons. We started\r\nat sunrise on the 10th, and being still favoured by wind and weather,\r\nmade a pleasant passage, reaching Obydos, which is nearly fifty miles\r\ndistant from Santarem, by midnight. We sailed all day close to the\r\nsouthern shore, and found the banks here and there dotted with houses\r\nof settlers, each surrounded by its plantation of cacao, which is the\r\nstaple product of the district. This coast has an evil reputation for\r\nstorms and mosquitoes, but we fortunately escaped both. It was\r\nremarkable that we had been troubled by mosquitoes only on one night,\r\nand then to a small degree, during the whole of our voyage.\r\n\r\nI landed at Obydos the next morning, and then bid adieu to my kind\r\nfriend Joao da Cunha, who, after landing my baggage, got up his anchor\r\nand continued on his way. The town contains about 1200 inhabitants, and\r\nis airily situated on a high bluff, ninety or a hundred feet above the\r\nlevel of the river. The coast is precipitous for two or three miles\r\nhence to the west. The cliffs consist of the parti-coloured clay, or\r\nTabatinga, which occurs so frequently throughout the Amazons region;\r\nthe strong current of the river sets full against them in the season of\r\nhigh water, and annually carries away large portions. The clay in\r\nplaces is stratified alternately pink and yellow, the pink beds being\r\nthe thickest and of much harder texture than the others. When I\r\ndescended the river in 1859, a German Major of Engineers, in the employ\r\nof the Government, told me that he had found calcareous layers, thickly\r\nstudded with marine shells interstratified with the clay. On the top of\r\nthe Tabatinga lies a bed of sand, in some places several feet thick,\r\nand the whole formation rests on strata of sandstone, which are exposed\r\nonly when the river reaches its lowest level. Behind the town rises a\r\nfine rounded hill, and a range of similar elevations extends six miles\r\nwestward, terminating at the mouth of the Trombetas, a large river\r\nflowing through the interior of Guiana. Hills and lowlands alike are\r\ncovered with a sombre rolling forest. The river here is contracted to a\r\nbreadth of rather less than a mile (1738 yards), and the entire volume\r\nof its waters, the collective product of a score of mighty streams, is\r\npoured through the strait with tremendous velocity. It must be\r\nremarked, however, that the river valley itself is not contracted to\r\nthis breadth, the opposite shore not being continental land, but a low\r\nalluvial tract, subject to inundation more or less in the rainy season.\r\nBehind it lies an extensive lake, called the Lago Grande da Villa\r\nFranca, which communicates with the Amazons, both above and below\r\nObydos, and has therefore the appearance of a by-water or an old\r\nchannel of the river. This lake is about thirty-five miles in length,\r\nand from four to ten in width; but its waters are of little depth, and\r\nin the dry season its dimensions are much lessened. It has no\r\nperceptible current, and does not therefore now divert any portion of\r\nthe waters of the Amazons from their main course past Obydos.\r\n\r\nI remained at Obydos from the 11th of October to the 19th of November.\r\nI spent three weeks here, also, in 1859, when the place was much\r\nchanged through the influx of Portuguese immigrants and the building of\r\na fortress on the top of the bluff. It is one of the pleasantest towns\r\non the river. The houses are all roofed with tiles, and are mostly of\r\nsubstantial architecture. The inhabitants, at least at the time of my\r\nfirst visit, were naive in their ways, kind and sociable. Scarcely any\r\npalm-thatched huts are to be seen, for very few Indians now reside\r\nhere. It was one of the early settlements of the Portuguese, and the\r\nbetter class of the population consists of old-established white\r\nfamilies, who exhibit however, in some cases, traces of cross with the\r\nIndian and negro. Obydos and Santarem have received, during the last\r\neighty years, considerable importations of negro slaves; before that\r\ntime, a cruel traffic was carried on in Indians for the same purpose of\r\nforced servitude, but their numbers have gradually dwindled away, and\r\nIndians now form an insignificant element in the population of the\r\ndistrict. Most of the Obydos townsfolk are owners of cacao plantations,\r\nwhich are situated on the low lands in the vicinity. Some are large\r\ncattle proprietors, and possess estates of many square leagues’ extent\r\nin the campo, or grass-land districts, which border the Lago Grande,\r\nand other similar inland lakes, near the villages of Faro and Alemquer.\r\nThese campos bear a crop of nutritious grass; but in certain seasons,\r\nwhen the rising of the Amazons exceeds the average, they are apt to be\r\nflooded, and then the large herds of half wild cattle suffer great\r\nmortality from drowning, hunger, and alligators. Neither in\r\ncattle-keeping nor cacao-growing are any but the laziest and most\r\nprimitive methods followed, and the consequence is that the proprietors\r\nare generally poor. A few, however, have become rich by applying a\r\nmoderate amount of industry and skill to the management of their\r\nestates. People spoke of several heiresses in the neighbourhood whose\r\nwealth was reckoned in oxen and slaves; a dozen slaves and a few\r\nhundred head of cattle being considered a great fortune. Some of them I\r\nsaw had already been appropriated by enterprising young men, who had\r\ncome from Pará and Maranham to seek their fortunes in this quarter.\r\n\r\nThe few weeks I spent here passed away pleasantly. I generally spent\r\nthe evenings in the society of the townspeople, who associated together\r\n(contrary to Brazilian custom) in European fashion; the different\r\nfamilies meeting at one another’s houses for social amusement, bachelor\r\nfriends not being excluded, and the whole company, married and single,\r\njoining in simple games. The meetings used to take place in the\r\nsitting-rooms, and not in the open verandahs—a fashion almost\r\ncompulsory on account of the mosquitoes; but the evenings here are very\r\ncool, and the closeness of a room is not so much felt as it is in Pará.\r\nSunday was strictly observed at Obydos—at least all the shops were\r\nclosed, and almost the whole population went to church. The Vicar,\r\nPadre Raimundo do Sanchez Brito, was an excellent old man, and I fancy\r\nthe friendly manners of the people, and the general purity of morals at\r\nObydos, were owing in great part to the good example he set to his\r\nparishioners.\r\n\r\nThe forest at Obydos seemed to abound in monkeys, for I rarely passed a\r\nday without seeing several. I noticed four species: the Coaitá (Ateles\r\npaniscus), the Chrysothrix sciureus, the Callithrix torquatus, and our\r\nold Pará friend, Midas ursulus. The Coaitá is a large black monkey,\r\ncovered with coarse hair, and having the prominent parts of the face of\r\na tawny flesh-coloured hue. It is the largest of the Amazonian monkeys\r\nin stature, but is excelled in bulk by the “Barrigudo” (Lagothrix\r\nHumboldtii) of the Upper Amazons. It occurs throughout the lowlands of\r\nthe Lower and Upper Amazons, but does not range to the south beyond the\r\nlimits of the river plains. At that point an allied species, the\r\nWhite-whiskered Coaitá (Ateles marginatus) takes its place. The Coaitás\r\nare called by zoologists spider monkeys, on account of the length and\r\nslenderness of their body and limbs. In these apes the tail, as a\r\nprehensile organ, reaches its highest degree of perfection; and on this\r\naccount it would, perhaps, be correct to consider the Coaitás as the\r\nextreme development of the American type of apes. As far as we know,\r\nfrom living and fossil species, the New World has progressed no farther\r\nthan the Coaitá towards the production of a higher form of the\r\nQuadrumanous order. The tendency of Nature here has been, to all\r\nappearance, simply to perfect those organs which adapt the species more\r\nand more completely to a purely arboreal life; and no nearer approach\r\nhas been made towards the more advanced forms of anthropoid apes, which\r\nare the products of the Old World solely. The flesh of this monkey is\r\nmuch esteemed by the natives in this part of the country, and the\r\nMilitary Commandant of Obydos, Major Gama, every week sent a negro\r\nhunter to shoot one for his table. One day I went on a Coaitá hunt,\r\nborrowing a negro slave of a friend to show me the way. When in the\r\ndeepest part of a ravine we heard a rustling sound in the trees\r\noverhead, and Manoel soon pointed out a Coaitá to me. There was\r\nsomething human-like in its appearance, as the lean, dark, shaggy\r\ncreature moved deliberately amongst the branches at a great height. I\r\nfired, but unfortunately only wounded it in the belly. It fell with a\r\ncrash headlong about twenty or thirty feet, and then caught a bough\r\nwith its tail, which grasped it instantaneously, and then the animal\r\nremained suspended in mid-air. Before I could reload, it recovered\r\nitself and mounted nimbly to the topmost branches out of the reach of a\r\nfowling-piece, where we could perceive the poor thing apparently\r\nprobing the wound with its fingers. Coaitás are more frequently kept in\r\na tame state than any other kind of monkey. The Indians are very fond\r\nof them as pets, and the women often suckle them when young at their\r\nbreasts. They become attached to their masters, and will sometimes\r\nfollow them on the ground to considerable distances. I once saw a most\r\nridiculously tame Coaitá. It was an old female which accompanied its\r\nowner, a trader on the river, in all his voyages. By way of giving me a\r\nspecimen of its intelligence and feeling, its master set to and rated\r\nit soundly, calling it scamp, heathen, thief, and so forth, all through\r\nthe copious Portuguese vocabulary of vituperation. The poor monkey,\r\nquietly seated on the ground, seemed to be in sore trouble at this\r\ndisplay of anger. It began by looking earnestly at him, then it whined,\r\nand lastly rocked its body to and fro with emotion, crying piteously,\r\nand passing its long gaunt arms continually over its forehead; for this\r\nwas its habit when excited, and the front of the head was worn quite\r\nbald in consequence. At length its master altered his tone. “It’s all a\r\nlie, my old woman; you’re an angel, a flower, a good affectionate old\r\ncreature,” and so forth. Immediately the poor monkey ceased its\r\nwailing, and soon after came over to where the man sat. The disposition\r\nof the Coaitá is mild in the extreme: it has none of the painful,\r\nrestless vivacity of its kindred, the Cebi, and no trace of the surly,\r\nuntameable temper of its still nearer relatives, the Mycetes, or\r\nhowling monkeys. It is, however, an arrant thief, and shows\r\nconsiderable cunning in pilfering small articles of clothing, which it\r\nconceals in its sleeping place. The natives of the Upper Amazons\r\nprocure the Coaitá, when full grown, by shooting it with the blowpipe\r\nand poisoned darts, and restoring life by putting a little salt (the\r\nantidote to the Urarí poison with which the darts are tipped) in its\r\nmouth. The animals thus caught become tame forthwith. Two females were\r\nonce kept at the Jardin des Plantes of Paris, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nrelates of them that they rarely quitted each other, remaining most of\r\nthe time in close embrace, folding their tails around one another’s\r\nbodies. They took their meals together; and it was remarked on such\r\noccasions, when the friendship of animals is put to a hard test, that\r\nthey never quarrelled or disputed the possession of a favourite fruit\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeliconius Thelxiope and Heliconius Melpomene.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Obydos was rich also in insects. In the broad\r\nalleys of the forest a magnificent butterfly of the genus Morpho, six\r\nto eight inches in expanse, the Morpho Hecuba, was seen daily gliding\r\nalong at a height of twenty feet or more from the ground. Amongst the\r\nlower trees and bushes numerous kinds of Heliconii, a group of\r\nbutterflies peculiar to tropical America, having long narrow wings,\r\nwere very abundant. The prevailing ground colour of the wings of these\r\ninsects is a deep black, and on this are depicted spots and streaks of\r\ncrimson, white, and bright yellow, in different patterns according to\r\nthe species. Their elegant shape, showy colours, and slow, sailing mode\r\nof flight, make them very attractive objects, and their numbers are so\r\ngreat that they form quite a feature in the physiognomy of the forest,\r\ncompensating for the scarcity of flowers. Next to the Heliconii, the\r\nCatagrammas (C. astarte and C. peristera) were the most conspicuous.\r\nThese have a very rapid and short flight, settling frequently and\r\nremaining stationary for a long time on the trunks of trees. The\r\ncolours of their wings are vermilion and black, the surface having a\r\nrich velvety appearance. The genus owes its Greek name Catagramma\r\n(signifying “a letter beneath”) to the curious markings of the\r\nunderside of the wings, resembling Arabic numerals. The species and\r\nvarieties are of almost endless diversity, but the majority inhabit the\r\nhot valleys of the eastern parts of the Andes. Another butterfly nearly\r\nallied to these, Callithea Leprieurii, was also very abundant here at\r\nthe marshy head of the pool before mentioned. The wings are of a rich\r\ndark-blue colour, with a broad border of silvery green. These two\r\ngroups of Callithea and Catagramma are found only in tropical America,\r\nchiefly near the equator, and are certainly amongst the most beautiful\r\nproductions of a region where the animals and plants seem to have been\r\nfashioned in nature’s choicest moulds. A great variety of other\r\nbeautiful and curious insects adorned these pleasant woods. Others were\r\nseen only in the sunshine in open places. As the waters retreated from\r\nthe beach, vast numbers of sulphur-yellow and orange coloured\r\nbutterflies congregated on the moist sand. The greater portion of them\r\nbelonged to the genus Callidryas. They assembled in densely-packed\r\nmasses, sometimes two or three yards in circumference, their wings all\r\nheld in an upright position, so that the beach looked as though\r\nvariegated with beds of crocuses. These Callidryades seem to be\r\nmigratory insects, and have large powers of dissemination. During the\r\nlast two days of our voyage, the great numbers constantly passing over\r\nthe river attracted the attention of every one on board. They all\r\ncrossed in one direction, namely, from north to south, and the\r\nprocessions were uninterrupted from an early hour in the morning until\r\nsunset. All the individuals which resort to the margins of sandy\r\nbeaches are of the male sex. The females are much more rare, and are\r\nseen only on the borders of the forest, wandering from tree to tree,\r\nand depositing their eggs on low mimosas which grow in the shade. The\r\nmigrating hordes, as far as I could ascertain, are composed only of\r\nmales, and on this account I believe their wanderings do not extend\r\nvery far.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusical Cricket (Chloorocoelus Tanana). a. b. Lobes of wing-cases\r\ntransformed into a musical instrument.\r\n\r\nA strange kind of wood-cricket is found in this neighbourhood, the\r\nmales of which produce a very loud and not unmusical noise by rubbing\r\ntogether the overlapping edges of their wing-cases. The notes are\r\ncertainly the loudest and most extraordinary that I ever heard produced\r\nby an orthopterous insect. The natives call it the Tananá, in allusion\r\nto its music, which is a sharp, resonant stridulation resembling the\r\nsyllables ta-na-ná, ta-na-ná, succeeding each other with little\r\nintermission. It seems to be rare in the neighbourhood. When the\r\nnatives capture one, they keep it in a wicker-work cage for the sake of\r\nhearing it sing. A friend of mine kept one six days. It was lively only\r\nfor two or three, and then its loud note could be heard from one end of\r\nthe village to the other. When it died he gave me the specimen, the\r\nonly one I was able to procure. It is a member of the family Locustidæ,\r\na group intermediate between the Cricket (Achetidæ) and the\r\nGrasshoppers (Acridiidæ). The total length of the body is two inches\r\nand a quarter; when the wings are closed the insect has an inflated\r\nvesicular or bladder-like shape, owing to the great convexity of the\r\nthin but firm parchmenty wing-cases, and the colour is wholly\r\npale-green. The instrument by which the Tanana produces its music is\r\ncuriously contrived out of the ordinary nervures of the wing-cases. In\r\neach wing-case the inner edge, near its origin, has a horny expansion\r\nor lobe; on one wing (_b_) this lobe has sharp raised margins; on the\r\nother (_a_), the strong nervure which traverses the lobe on the under\r\nside is crossed by a number of fine sharp furrows like those of a file.\r\nWhen the insect rapidly moves its wings, the file of the one lobe is\r\nscraped sharply across the horny margin of the other, thus producing\r\nthe sounds; the parchmenty wing-cases and the hollow drum-like space\r\nwhich they enclose assist in giving resonance to the tones. The\r\nprojecting portions of both wing-cases are traversed by a similar\r\nstrong nervure, but this is scored like a file only in one of them, in\r\nthe other remaining perfectly smooth. Other species of the family to\r\nwhich the Tananá belongs have similar stridulating organs, but in none\r\nare these so highly developed as in this insect; they exist always in\r\nthe males only, the other sex having the edges of the wing-cases quite\r\nstraight and simple. The mode of producing the sounds and their object\r\nhave been investigated by several authors with regard to certain\r\nEuropean species. They are the call-notes of the males. In the common\r\nfield-cricket of Europe the male has been observed to place itself, in\r\nthe evening, at the entrance of its burrow, and stridulate until a\r\nfemale approaches, when the louder notes are succeeded by a more\r\nsubdued tone, whilst the successful musician caresses with his antennæ\r\nthe mate he has won. Anyone who will take the trouble may observe a\r\nsimilar proceeding in the common house-cricket. The nature and object\r\nof this insect music are more uniform than the structure and situation\r\nof the instrument by which it is produced. This differs in each of the\r\nthree allied families above mentioned. In the crickets the wing-cases\r\nare symmetrical; both have straight edges and sharply-scored nervures\r\nadapted to produce the stridulation. A distinct portion of their edges\r\nis not, therefore, set apart for the elaboration of a sound-producing\r\ninstrument. In this family the wing-cases lie flat on the back of the\r\ninsect, and overlap each other for a considerable portion of their\r\nextent. In the Locustidæ the same members have a sloping position on\r\neach side of the body, and do not overlap, except to a small extent\r\nnear their bases; it is out of this small portion that the stridulating\r\norgan is contrived. Greater resonance is given in most species by a\r\nthin transparent plate, covered by a membrane, in the centre of the\r\noverlapping lobes. In the Grasshoppers (Acridiidæ) the wing-cases meet\r\nin a straight suture, and the friction of portions of their edges is no\r\nlonger possible. But Nature exhibits the same fertility of resource\r\nhere as elsewhere; and in contriving other methods of supplying the\r\nmales with an instrument for the production of call-notes indicates the\r\ngreat importance which she attaches to this function. The music in the\r\nmales of the Acridiidæ is produced by the scraping of the long hind\r\nthighs against the horny nervures of the outer edges of the wing-cases;\r\na drum-shaped organ placed in a cavity near the insertion of the thighs\r\nbeing adapted to give resonance to the tones.\r\n\r\nI obtained very few birds at Obydos. There was no scarcity of birds,\r\nbut they were mostly common Cayenne species. In early morning, the\r\nwoods near my house were quite animated with their songs—an unusual\r\nthing in this country. I heard here for the first time the pleasing\r\nwild notes of the Carashue, a species of thrush, probably the Mimus\r\nlividus of ornithologists. I found it afterwards to be a common bird in\r\nthe scattered woods of the campo district near Santarem. It is a much\r\nsmaller and plainer-coloured bird than our thrush, and its song is not\r\nso loud, varied, or so long sustained; but the tone is of a sweet and\r\nplaintive quality, which harmonises well with the wild and silent\r\nwoodlands, where alone it is heard in the mornings and evenings of\r\nsultry tropical days. In course of time the song of this humble thrush\r\nstirred up pleasing associations in my mind, in the same way as those\r\nof its more highly endowed sisters formerly did at home. There are\r\nseveral allied species in Brazil; in the southern provinces they are\r\ncalled Sabiahs. The Brazilians are not insensible to the charms of this\r\ntheir best songster, for I often heard some pretty verses in praise of\r\nthe Sabiah sung by young people to the accompaniment of the guitar. I\r\nfound several times the nest of the Carashué, which is built of dried\r\ngrass and slender twigs, and lined with mud; the eggs are coloured and\r\nspotted like those of our blackbird, but they are considerably smaller.\r\nI was much pleased with a brilliant little red-headed mannikin, which I\r\nshot here (Pipra cornuta). There were three males seated on a low\r\nbranch, and hopping slowly backwards and forwards, near to one another,\r\nas though engaged in a kind of dance. In the pleasant airy woods\r\nsurrounding the sandy shores of the pool behind the town, the\r\nyellow-bellied Trogon (T. viridis) was very common. Its back is of a\r\nbrilliant metallic-green colour, and the breast steel blue. The natives\r\ncall it the Suruquá do Ygapó, or Trogon of the flooded lands, in\r\ncontradistinction to the red-breasted species, which are named\r\nSurtiquás da terra firma. I often saw small companies of half a dozen\r\nindividuals quietly seated on the lower branches of trees. They\r\nremained almost motionless for an hour or two at a time, simply moving\r\ntheir heads, on the watch for passing insects; or, as seemed more\r\ngenerally to be the case, scanning the neighbouring trees for fruit,\r\nwhich they darted off now and then, at long intervals, to secure,\r\nreturning always to the same perch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\nTHE LOWER AMAZONS—OBYDOS TO MANAOS, OR THE BARRA OF THE RIO NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nDeparture from Obydos — River Banks and By-channels — Cacao Planters —\r\nDaily Life on Board Our Vessel — Great Storm — Sand-island and its\r\nBirds — Hill of Parentins — Negro Trader and Mauhés Indians — Villa\r\nNova, its Inhabitants, Forest, and Animal Productions — Cararaucú — A\r\nrustic Festival — Lake of Cararaucú — Motúca Flies — Serpa — Christmas\r\nHolidays — River Madeira — A Mameluco Farmer — Múra Indians — Rio Negro\r\n— Description of Barra — Descent to Pará — Yellow Fever.\r\n\r\nA trader of Obydos, named Penna, was proceeding about in a cuberta\r\nladen with merchandise to the Rio Negro, intending to stop frequently\r\non the road, so I bargained with him for a passage. He gave up a part\r\nof the toldo, or fore-cabin as it may be called, and here I slung my\r\nhammock and arranged my boxes so as to be able to work as we went\r\nalong. The stoppages I thought would be an advantage, as I could\r\ncollect in the woods whilst he traded, and thus acquire a knowledge of\r\nthe productions of many places on the river which on a direct voyage\r\nwould be impossible to do. I provided a stock of groceries for two\r\nmonths’ consumption; and, after the usual amount of unnecessary fuss\r\nand delay on the part of the owner, we started on the 19th of November.\r\nPenna took his family with him: this comprised a smart, lively mameluco\r\nwoman, named Catarina, whom we called Senhora Katita, and two children.\r\nThe crew consisted of three men: one a sturdy Indian, another a Cafuzo,\r\ngodson of Penna, and the third, our best hand, a steady, good-natured\r\nmulatto, named Joaquim. My boy Luco was to assist in rowing and so\r\nforth. Penna was a timid middle-aged man, a white with a slight cross\r\nof Indian; when he was surly and obstinate, he used to ask me to excuse\r\nhim on account of the Tapuyo blood in his veins. He tried to make me as\r\ncomfortable as the circumstances admitted, and provided a large stock\r\nof eatables and drinkables; so that altogether the voyage promised to\r\nbe a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the port of Obydos, we crossed over to the right bank and\r\nsailed with a light wind all day, passing numerous houses, each\r\nsurrounded by its grove of cacao trees. On the 20th we made slow\r\nprogress. After passing the high land at the mouth of the Trombetas,\r\nthe banks were low, clayey, or earthy on both sides. The breadth of the\r\nriver varies hereabout from two and a half to three miles, but neither\r\ncoast is the true terra firma. On the northern side a by-channel runs\r\nfor a long distance inland, communicating with the extensive lake of\r\nFaro; on the south, three channels lead to the similar fresh-water sea\r\nof Villa Franca; these are in part arms of the river, so that the land\r\nthey surround consists, properly speaking, of islands. When this\r\ndescription of land is not formed wholly of river deposit, as sometimes\r\nhappens, or is raised above the level of the highest floods, it is\r\ncalled _Ygapó alto_, and is distinguished by the natives from the true\r\nislands of mid-river, as well as from the terra firma. We landed at one\r\nof the cacao plantations. The house was substantially built; the walls\r\nformed of strong upright posts, lathed across, plastered with mud and\r\nwhitewashed, and the roof tiled. The family were mamelucos, and seemed\r\nto be an average sample of the poorer class of cacao growers. All were\r\nloosely dressed and bare-footed. A broad verandah extended along one\r\nside of the house, the floor of which was simply the well-trodden\r\nearth; and here hammocks were slung between the bare upright supports,\r\na large rush mat being spread on the ground, upon which the stout\r\nmatron-like mistress, with a tame parrot perched upon her shoulder, sat\r\nsewing with two pretty little mulatto girls. The master, coolly clad in\r\nshirt and drawers, the former loose about the neck, lay in his hammock\r\nsmoking a long gaudily-painted wooden pipe. The household utensils,\r\nearthenware jars, water-pots and saucepans lay at one end, near which\r\nwas a wood fire, with the ever-ready coffee-pot simmering on the top of\r\na clay tripod. A large shed stood a short distance off, embowered in a\r\ngrove of banana, papaw, and mango trees; and under it were the ovens,\r\ntroughs, sieves, and all other apparatus for the preparation of\r\nmandioca. The cleared space around the house was only a few yards in\r\nextent; beyond it lay the cacao plantations, which stretched on each\r\nside parallel to the banks of the river. There was a path through the\r\nforest which led to the mandioca fields, and several miles beyond to\r\nother houses on the banks of an interior channel. We were kindly\r\nreceived, as is always the case when a stranger visits these\r\nout-of-the-way habitations; the people being invariably civil and\r\nhospitable. We had a long chat, took coffee, and upon departing, one of\r\nthe daughters sent a basket full of oranges for our use down to the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a cacao plantation in the Obydos district is after the rate\r\nof 240 reis or sixpence per tree, which is much higher than at Cametá,\r\nwhere I believe the yield is not so great. The forest here is cleared\r\nbefore planting, and the trees are grown in rows. The smaller\r\ncultivators are all very poor. Labour is scarce; one family generally\r\nmanages its own small plantation of 10,000 to 15,000 trees, but at the\r\nharvest time neighbours assist each other. It appeared to me to be an\r\neasy, pleasant life; the work is all done under shade, and occupies\r\nonly a few weeks in the year. The incorrigible nonchalance and laziness\r\nof the people alone prevent them from surrounding themselves with all\r\nthe luxuries of a tropical country. They might plant orchards of the\r\nchoicest fruit trees around their houses, grow Indian corn, and rear\r\ncattle and hogs, as intelligent settlers from Europe would certainly\r\ndo, instead of indolently relying solely on the produce of their small\r\nplantations, and living on a meagre diet of fish and farinha. In\r\npreparing the cacao they have not devised any means of separating the\r\nseeds well from the pulp, or drying it in a systematic way; the\r\nconsequence is that, although naturally of good quality, it molds\r\nbefore reaching the merchants’ stores, and does not fetch more than\r\nhalf the price of the same article grown in other parts of tropical\r\nAmerica. The Amazons region is the original home of the principal\r\nspecies of chocolate tree, the Theobroma cacao; and it grows in\r\nabundance in the forests of the upper river. The cultivated crop\r\nappears to be a precarious one; little or no care, however, is bestowed\r\non the trees, and even weeding is done very inefficiently. The\r\nplantations are generally old, and have been made on the low ground\r\nnear the river, which renders them liable to inundation when this rises\r\na few inches more than the average. There is plenty of higher land\r\nquite suitable to the tree, but it is uncleared, and the want of labour\r\nand enterprise prevents the establishment of new plantations.\r\n\r\nWe passed the last houses in the Obydos district on the 20th, and the\r\nriver scenery then resumed its usual wild and solitary character, which\r\nthe scattered human habitations relieved, although in a small degree.\r\nWe soon fell into a regular mode of life on board our little ark. Penna\r\nwould not travel by night; indeed, our small crew, wearied by the day’s\r\nlabour, required rest, and we very rarely had wind in the night. We\r\nused to moor the vessel to a tree, giving out plenty of cable, so as to\r\nsleep at a distance from the banks and free of mosquitoes, which\r\nalthough swarming in the forest, rarely came many yards out into the\r\nriver at this season of the year. The strong current at a distance of\r\nthirty or forty yards from the coast steadied the cuberta head to\r\nstream, and kept us from drifting ashore. We all slept in the open air,\r\nas the heat of the cabins was stifling in the early part of the night.\r\nPenna, Senhora Katita, and I slung our hammocks in triangle between the\r\nmainmast and two stout poles fixed in the raised deck. A sheet was the\r\nonly covering required, besides our regular clothing, for the decrease\r\nof temperature at night on the Amazons is never so great as to be felt\r\notherwise than as a delightful coolness after the sweltering heat of\r\nthe afternoons. We used to rise when the first gleam of dawn showed\r\nitself above the long, dark line of forest. Our clothes and hammocks\r\nwere then generally soaked with dew, but this was not felt to be an\r\ninconvenience. The Indian Manoel used to revive himself by a plunge in\r\nthe river, under the bows of the vessel. It is the habit of all\r\nIndians, male and female, to bathe early in the morning; they do it\r\nsometimes for warmth’s sake, the temperature of the water being often\r\nconsiderably higher than that of the air. Penna and I lolled in our\r\nhammocks, whilst Katita prepared the indispensable cup of strong\r\ncoffee, which she did with wonderful celerity, smoking meanwhile her\r\nearly morning pipe of tobacco. Liberal owners of river craft allow a\r\ncup of coffee sweetened with molasses, or a ration of cashaca, to each\r\nman of their crews; Penna gave them coffee. When all were served, the\r\nday’s work began. There was seldom any wind at this early hour, so if\r\nthere was still water along the shore, the men rowed, if not, there was\r\nno way of progressing but by espia. In some places the currents ran\r\nwith great force close to the banks, especially where these receded to\r\nform long bays or _ enseadas_, as they are called, and then we made\r\nvery little headway. In such places the banks consist of loose earth, a\r\nrich crumbly vegetable mold supporting a growth of most luxuriant\r\nforest, of which the currents almost daily carry away large portions,\r\nso that the stream for several yards out is encumbered with fallen\r\ntrees whose branches quiver in the current. When projecting points of\r\nland were encountered, it was impossible, with our weak crew, to pull\r\nthe cuberta against the whirling torrents which set round them; and in\r\nsuch cases we had to cross the river, drifting often with the current,\r\na mile or two lower down on the opposite shore. There generally sprung\r\na light wind as the day advanced, and then we took down our hammocks,\r\nhoisted all sail, and bowled away merrily. Penna generally preferred to\r\ncook the dinner ashore, when there was little or no wind. About midday\r\non these calm days, we used to look out for a nice shady nook in the\r\nforest with cleared space sufficient to make a fire upon. I then had an\r\nhour’s hunting in the neighbouring wilderness, and was always rewarded\r\nby the discovery of some new species. During the greater part of our\r\nvoyage, however, we stopped at the house of some settler, and made our\r\nfire in the port. Just before dinner it was our habit to take a bath in\r\nthe river, and then, according to the universal custom on the Amazons,\r\nwhere it seems to be suitable on account of the weak fish diet, we each\r\ntook half a tea-cup full of neat cashaça, the “abre” or “opening,” as\r\nit is called, and set to on our mess of stewed pirarucú, beans, and\r\nbacon. Once or twice a week we had fowls and rice; at supper, after\r\nsunset, we often had fresh fish caught by our men in the evening. The\r\nmornings were cool and pleasant until towards midday; but in the\r\nafternoons, the heat became almost intolerable, especially in gleamy,\r\nsqually weather, such as generally prevailed. We then crouched in the\r\nshade of the sails, or went down to our hammocks in the cabin, choosing\r\nto be half stifled rather than expose ourselves on deck to the\r\nsickening heat of the sun. We generally ceased travelling about nine\r\no’clock, fixing upon a safe spot wherein to secure the vessel for the\r\nnight. The cool evening hours were delicious; flocks of whistling ducks\r\n(Anas autumnalis), parrots, and hoarsely-screaming macaws, pair by\r\npair, flew over from their feeding to their resting places, as the\r\nglowing sun plunged abruptly beneath the horizon. The brief evening\r\nchorus of animals then began, the chief performers being the howling\r\nmonkeys, whose frightful unearthly roar deepened the feeling of\r\nsolitude which crept up as darkness closed around us. Soon after, the\r\nfireflies in great diversity of species came forth and flitted about\r\nthe trees. As night advanced, all became silent in the forest, save the\r\noccasional hooting of tree-frogs, or the monotonous chirping of\r\nwood-crickets and grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nWe made but little progress on the 20th and two following days, on\r\naccount of the unsteadiness of the wind. The dry season had been of\r\nvery brief duration this year; it generally lasts in this part of the\r\nAmazons from July to January, with a short interval of showery weather\r\nin November. The river ought to sink thirty or thirty-five feet below\r\nits highest point; this year it had declined only about twenty-five\r\nfeet, and the November rains threatened to be continuous. The drier the\r\nweather the stronger blows the east wind; it now failed us altogether,\r\nor blew gently for a few hours merely in the afternoons. I had hitherto\r\nseen the great river only in its sunniest aspect; I was now about to\r\nwitness what it could furnish in the way of storms.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 22nd the moon appeared with a misty halo. As we\r\nwent to rest, a fresh watery wind was blowing, and a dark pile of\r\nclouds gathered up river in a direction opposite to that of the wind. I\r\nthought this betokened nothing more than a heavy rain which would send\r\nus all in a hurry to our cabins. The men moored the vessel to a tree\r\nalongside a hard clayey bank, and after supper, all were soon fast\r\nasleep, scattered about the raised deck. About eleven o’clock I was\r\nawakened by a horrible uproar, as a hurricane of wind suddenly swept\r\nover from the opposite shore. The cuberta was hurled with force against\r\nthe clayey bank; Penna shouted out, as he started to his legs, that a\r\ntrovoada de cima, or a squall from up-river, was upon us. We took down\r\nour hammocks, and then all hands were required to save the vessel from\r\nbeing dashed to pieces. The moon set, and a black pall of clouds spread\r\nitself over the dark forests and river; a frightful crack of thunder\r\nnow burst over our heads, and down fell the drenching rain. Joaquim\r\nleapt ashore through the drowning spray with a strong pole, and tried\r\nto pass the cuberta round a small projecting point, whilst we on deck\r\naided in keeping her off and lengthened the cable. We succeeded in\r\ngetting free, and the stout-built boat fell off into the strong current\r\nfarther away from the shore, Joaquim swinging himself dexterously\r\naboard by the bowsprit as it passed the point. It was fortunate for us\r\nthat he happened to be on a sloping clayey bank where there was no fear\r\nof falling trees; a few yards farther on, where the shore was\r\nperpendicular and formed of crumbly earth, large portions of loose\r\nsoil, with all their superincumbent mass of forest, were being washed\r\naway; the uproar thus occasioned adding to the horrors of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the wind abated in the course of an hour, but the\r\ndeluge of rain continued until about three o’clock in the morning; the\r\nsky was lighted up by almost incessant flashes of pallid lightning, and\r\nthe thunder pealing from side to side without interruption. Our\r\nclothing, hammocks, and goods were thoroughly soaked by the streams of\r\nwater which trickled through between the planks. In the morning all was\r\nquiet, but an opaque, leaden mass of clouds overspread the sky,\r\nthrowing a gloom over the wild landscape that had a most dispiriting\r\neffect. These squalls from the west are always expected about the time\r\nof the breaking up of the dry season in these central parts of the\r\nLower Amazons. They generally take place about the beginning of\r\nFebruary, so that this year they had commenced much earlier than usual.\r\nThe soil and climate are much drier in this part of the country than in\r\nthe region lying farther to the west, where the denser forests and more\r\nclayey, humid soil produce a considerably cooler atmosphere. The storms\r\nmay be, therefore, attributed to the rush of cold moist air from up\r\nriver, when the regular trade-wind coming from the sea has slackened or\r\nceased to blow.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th we arrived at a large sand bank connected with an island in\r\nmid-river, in front of an inlet called Maracá-uassú. Here we anchored\r\nand spent half a day ashore. Penna’s object in stopping was simply to\r\nenjoy a ramble on the sands with the children, and give Senhora Katita\r\nan opportunity to wash the linen. The sandbank was now fast going under\r\nwater with the rise of the river; in the middle of the dry season it is\r\nabout a mile long and half a mile in width. The canoe-men delight in\r\nthese open spaces, which are a great relief to the monotony of the\r\nforest that clothes the land in every other part of the river. Farther\r\nwestward they are much more frequent, and of larger extent. They lie\r\ngenerally at the upper end of islands; in fact, the latter originate in\r\naccretions of vegetable matter formed by plants and trees growing on a\r\nshoal. The island was wooded chiefly with the trumpet tree (Cecropia\r\npeltata), which has a hollow stem and smooth pale bark. The leaves are\r\nsimilar in shape to those of the horse-chestnut, but immensely larger;\r\nbeneath they are white, and when the welcome trade-wind blows they show\r\ntheir silvery undersides,—a pleasant signal to the weary canoe\r\ntraveller. The mode of growth of this tree is curious: the branches are\r\nemitted at nearly right angles with the stem, the branchlets in minor\r\nwhorls around these, and so forth, the leaves growing at their\r\nextremities, so that the total appearance is that of a huge\r\ncandelabrum. Cecropiæ of different species are characteristic of\r\nBrazilian forest scenery; the kind of which I am speaking grows in\r\ngreat numbers everywhere on the banks of the Amazons where the land is\r\nlow. In the same places the curious Monguba tree (Bombax ceiba) is also\r\nplentiful; the dark green bark of its huge tapering trunk, scored with\r\ngrey, forming a conspicuous object. The principal palm tree on the\r\nlowlands is the Jauarí (Astryocaryum Jauarí), whose stem, surrounded by\r\nwhorls of spines, shoots up to a great height. On the borders of the\r\nisland were large tracts of arrow-grass (Gynerium saccharoides), which\r\nbears elegant plumes of flowers, like those of the reed, and grows to a\r\nheight of twenty feet, the leaves arranged in a fan-shaped figure near\r\nthe middle of the stem. I was surprised to find on the higher parts of\r\nthe sandbank the familiar foliage of a willow (Salix Humboldtiana). It\r\nis a dwarf species, and grows in patches resembling beds of osiers; as\r\nin the English willows, the leaves were peopled by small\r\nchrysomelideous beetles. In wandering about, many features reminded me\r\nof the seashore. Flocks of white gulls were flying overhead, uttering\r\ntheir well-known cry, and sandpipers coursed along the edge of the\r\nwater. Here and there lonely wading-birds were stalking about; one of\r\nthese, the Curicáca (Ibis melanopis), flew up with a low cackling\r\nnoise, and was soon joined by a unicorn bird (Palamedea cornuta), which\r\nI startled up from amidst the bushes, whose harsh screams, resembling\r\nthe bray of a jackass, but shriller, disturbed unpleasantly the\r\nsolitude of the place. Amongst the willow bushes were flocks of a\r\nhandsome bird belonging to the Icteridæ or troupial family, adorned\r\nwith a rich plumage of black and saffron-yellow. I spent some time\r\nwatching an assemblage of a species of bird called by the natives\r\nTumburí-pará, on the Cecropia trees. It is the Monasa nigrifrons of\r\nornithologists, and has a plain slate-coloured plumage with the beak of\r\nan orange hue. It belongs to the family of Barbets, most of whose\r\nmembers are remarkable for their dull, inactive temperament. Those\r\nspecies which are arranged by ornithologists under the genus Bucco are\r\ncalled by the Indians, in the Tupí language, Tai-assú uirá, or\r\npig-birds. They remain seated sometimes for hours together on low\r\nbranches in the shade, and are stimulated to exertion only when\r\nattracted by passing insects. This flock of Tamburí-pará were the\r\nreverse of dull; they were gambolling and chasing each other amongst\r\nthe branches. As they sported about, each emitted a few short tuneful\r\nnotes, which altogether produced a ringing, musical chorus that quite\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th we reached an elevated wooded promontory, called Parentins,\r\nwhich now forms the boundary between the provinces of Pará and the\r\nAmazons. Here we met a small canoe descending to Santarem. The owner\r\nwas a free negro named Lima, who, with his wife, was going down the\r\nriver to exchange his year’s crop of tobacco for European merchandise.\r\nThe long shallow canoe was laden nearly to the water level. He resided\r\non the banks of the Abacaxí, a river which discharges its waters into\r\nthe Canomá, a broad interior channel which extends from the river\r\nMadeira to the Parentins, a distance of 180 miles. Penna offered him\r\nadvantageous terms, so a bargain was struck, and the man saved his long\r\njourney. The negro seemed a frank, straightforward fellow; he was a\r\nnative of Pernambuco, but had settled many years ago in this part of\r\nthe country. He had with him a little Indian girl belonging to the\r\nMauhés tribe, whose native seat is the district of country lying in the\r\nrear of the Canomá, between the Madeira and the Tapajos. The Mauhés are\r\nconsidered, I think with truth, to be a branch of the great Mundurucú\r\nnation, having segregated from them at a remote period, and by long\r\nisolation acquired different customs and a totally different language,\r\nin a manner which seems to have been general with the Brazilian\r\naborigines. The Mundurucús seem to have retained more of the general\r\ncharacteristics of the original Tupí stock than the Mauhés. Senhor Lima\r\ntold me, what I afterwards found to be correct, that there were\r\nscarcely two words alike in the languages of the two peoples, although\r\nthere are words closely allied to Tupí in both. The little girl had not\r\nthe slightest trace of the savage in her appearance. Her features were\r\nfinely shaped, the cheek-bones not at all prominent, the lips thin, and\r\nthe expression of her countenance frank and smiling. She had been\r\nbrought only a few weeks previously from a remote settlement of her\r\ntribe on the banks of the Abacaxí, and did not yet know five words of\r\nPortuguese. The Indians, as a general rule, are very manageable when\r\nthey are young, but it is a general complaint that when they reach the\r\nage of puberty they become restless and discontented. The rooted\r\nimpatience of all restraint then shows itself, and the kindest\r\ntreatment will not prevent them running away from their masters; they\r\ndo not return to the malocas of their tribes, but join parties who go\r\nout to collect the produce of the forests and rivers, and lead a\r\nwandering semi-savage kind of life.\r\n\r\nWe remained under the Serra dos Parentins all night. Early the next\r\nmorning a light mist hung about the tree-tops, and the forest resounded\r\nwith the yelping of Whaiápu-sai monkeys. I went ashore with my gun and\r\ngot a glimpse of the flock, but did not succeed in obtaining a\r\nspecimen. They were of small size and covered with long fur of a\r\nuniform grey colour. I think the species was the Callithrix\r\ndonacophilus. The rock composing the elevated ridge of the Parentins is\r\nthe same coarse iron-cemented conglomerate which I have often spoken of\r\nas occurring near Pará and in several other places. Many loose blocks\r\nwere scattered about. The forest was extremely varied, and inextricable\r\ncoils of woody climbers stretched from tree to tree. Thongs of cacti\r\nwere spread over the rocks and tree-trunks. The variety of small,\r\nbeautifully-shaped ferns, lichens, and boleti, made the place quite a\r\nmuseum of cryptogamic plants. I found here two exquisite species of\r\nLongicorn beetles, and a large kind of grasshopper (Pterochroza) whose\r\nbroad fore-wings resembled the leaf of a plant, providing the insect\r\nwith a perfect disguise when they were closed; whilst the hind wings\r\nwere decorated with gaily-coloured eye-like spots.\r\n\r\nThe negro left us and turned up a narrow channel, the Paraná-mirim dos\r\nRamos (the little river of the branches, _i.e._, having many\r\nramifications), on the road to his home, 130 miles distant. We then\r\ncontinued our voyage, and in the evening arrived at Villa Nova, a\r\nstraggling village containing about seventy houses, many of which\r\nscarcely deserve the name, being mere mud-huts roofed with palm-leaves.\r\nWe stayed here four days. The village is built on a rocky bank,\r\ncomposed of the same coarse conglomerate as that already so often\r\nmentioned. In some places a bed of Tabatinga clay rests on the\r\nconglomerate. The soil in the neighbourhood is sandy, and the forest,\r\nmost of which appears to be of second growth, is traversed by broad\r\nalleys which terminate to the south and east on the banks of pools and\r\nlakes, a chain of which extends through the interior of the land. As\r\nsoon as we anchored I set off with Luco to explore the district. We\r\nwalked about a mile along the marly shore, on which was a thick carpet\r\nof flowering shrubs, enlivened by a great variety of lovely little\r\nbutterflies, and then entered the forest by a dry watercourse. About a\r\nfurlong inland this opened on a broad placid pool, whose banks, clothed\r\nwith grass of the softest green hue, sloped gently from the water’s\r\nedge to the compact wall of forest which encompassed the whole. The\r\npool swarmed with water-fowl; snowy egrets, dark-coloured striped\r\nherons, and storks of various species standing in rows around its\r\nmargins. Small flocks of macaws were stirring about the topmost\r\nbranches of the trees. Long-legged piosócas (Perra Jacana) stalked over\r\nthe water plants on the surface of the pool, and in the bushes on its\r\nmargin were great numbers of a kind of canary (Sycalis brasiliensis) of\r\na greenish-yellow colour, which has a short and not very melodious\r\nsong. We had advanced but a few steps when we startled a pair of the\r\nJaburú-moleque (Mycteria americana), a powerful bird of the stork\r\nfamily, four and a half feet in height, which flew up and alarmed the\r\nrest, so that I got only one bird out of the tumultuous flocks which\r\npassed over our heads. Passing towards the farther end of the pool I\r\nsaw, resting on the surface of the water, a number of large round\r\nleaves turned up at their edges; they belonged to the Victoria\r\nwater-lily. The leaves were just beginning to expand (December 3rd),\r\nsome were still under water, and the largest of those which had reached\r\nthe surface measured not quite three feet in diameter. We found a\r\nmontaria with a paddle in it, drawn up on the bank, which I took leave\r\nto borrow of the unknown owner, and Luco paddled me amongst the noble\r\nplants to search for flowers, meeting, however, with no success. I\r\nlearned afterwards that the plant is common in nearly all the lakes of\r\nthis neighbourhood. The natives call it the furno do Piosoca, or oven\r\nof the Jacana, the shape of the leaves being like that of the ovens on\r\nwhich Mandioca meal is roasted. We saw many kinds of hawks and eagles,\r\none of which, a black species, the Caracára-í (Milvago nudicollis), sat\r\non the top of a tall naked stump, uttering its hypocritical whining\r\nnotes. This eagle is considered a bird of ill omen by the Indians: it\r\noften perches on the tops of trees in the neighbourhood of their huts,\r\nand is then said to bring a warning of death to some member of the\r\nhousehold. Others say that its whining cry is intended to attract other\r\ndefenceless birds within its reach. The little courageous flycatcher\r\nBem-ti-vi (Saurophagus sulphuratus) assembles in companies of four or\r\nfive, and attacks it boldly, driving it from the perch where it would\r\notherwise sit for hours. I shot three hawks of as many different\r\nspecies; and these, with a Magoary stork, two beautiful gilded-green\r\njacamars (Galbula chalcocephala), and half-a-dozen leaves of the\r\nwater-lily, made a heavy load, with which we trudged off back to the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nA few years after this visit, namely, in 1854-5, I passed eight months\r\nat Villa Nova. The district of which it is the chief town is very\r\nextensive, for it has about forty miles of linear extent along the\r\nbanks of the river; but, the whole does not contain more than 4000\r\ninhabitants. More than half of these are pure-blood Indians who live in\r\na semi-civilised condition on the banks of the numerous channels and\r\nlakes. The trade of the place is chiefly in India-rubber, balsam of\r\nCopaiba (which are collected on the banks of the Madeira and the\r\nnumerous rivers that enter the Canomá channel), and salt fish, prepared\r\nin the dry season, nearer home. These articles are sent to Pará in\r\nexchange for European goods. The few Indian and half-breed families who\r\nreside in the town are many shades inferior in personal qualities and\r\nsocial condition to those I lived amongst near Pará and Cametá. They\r\nlive in wretched dilapidated mud-hovels; the women cultivate small\r\npatches of mandioca; the men spend most of their time in fishing,\r\nselling what they do not require themselves and getting drunk with the\r\nmost exemplary regularity on cashaca, purchased with the proceeds.\r\n\r\nI made, in this second visit to Villa Nova, an extensive collection of\r\nthe natural productions of the neighbourhood. A few remarks on some of\r\nthe more interesting of these must suffice. The forests are very\r\ndifferent in their general character from those of Pará, and in fact\r\nthose of humid districts generally throughout the Amazons. The same\r\nscarcity of large-leaved Musaceous and Marantaceous plants was\r\nnoticeable here as at Obydos. The low-lying areas of forest or Ygapós,\r\nwhich alternate everywhere with the more elevated districts, did not\r\nfurnish the same luxuriant vegetation as they do in the Delta region of\r\nthe Amazons. They are flooded during three or four months in the year,\r\nand when the waters retire, the soil—to which the very thin coating of\r\nalluvial deposit imparts little fertility—remains bare, or covered with\r\na matted bed of dead leaves until the next flood season. These tracts\r\nhave then a barren appearance; the trunks and lower branches of the\r\ntrees are coated with dried slime, and disfigured by rounded masses of\r\nfresh-water sponges, whose long horny spiculæ and dingy colours give\r\nthem the appearance of hedgehogs. Dense bushes of a harsh, cutting\r\ngrass, called Tiriríca, form almost the only fresh vegetation in the\r\ndry season. Perhaps the dense shade, the long period during which the\r\nland remains under water, and the excessively rapid desiccation when\r\nthe waters retire, all contribute to the barrenness of these Ygapós.\r\nThe higher and drier land is everywhere sandy, and tall coarse grasses\r\nline the borders of the broad alleys which have been cut through the\r\nsecond-growth woods. These places swarm with carapatos, ugly ticks\r\nbelonging to the genus Ixodes, which mount to the tips of blades of\r\ngrass, and attach themselves to the clothes of passers-by. They are a\r\ngreat annoyance. It occupied me a full hour daily to pick them off my\r\nflesh after my diurnal ramble. There are two species; both are much\r\nflattened in shape, have four pairs of legs, a thick short proboscis\r\nand a horny integument. Their habit is to attach themselves to the skin\r\nby plunging their proboscides into it, and then suck the blood until\r\ntheir flat bodies are distended into a globular form. The whole\r\nproceeding, however, is very slow, and it takes them several days to\r\npump their fill. No pain or itching is felt, but serious sores are\r\ncaused if care is not taken in removing them, as the proboscis is\r\nliable to break off and remain in the wound. A little tobacco juice is\r\ngenerally applied to make them loosen their hold. They do not cling\r\nfirmly to the skin by their legs, although each of these has a pair of\r\nsharp and fine claws connected with the tips of the member by means of\r\na flexible pedicle. When they mount to the summits of slender blades of\r\ngrass, or the tips of leaves, they hold on by their forelegs only, the\r\nother three pairs being stretched out so as to fasten onto any animal\r\nwhich comes their way. The smaller of the two species is of a yellowish\r\ncolour; it is the most abundant, and sometimes falls upon one by\r\nscores. When distended, it is about the size of a No. 8 shot; the\r\nlarger kind, which fortunately comes only singly to the work, swells to\r\nthe size of a pea.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the interior, the soil is composed of very coarse sand\r\nand small fragments of quartz; in these places no trees grow. I\r\nvisited, in company with the priest, Padre Torquato, one of these\r\ntreeless spaces or campos, as they are called, situated five miles from\r\nthe village. The road thither led through a varied and beautiful\r\nforest, containing many gigantic trees. I missed the Assai, Mirtí,\r\nPaxiúba, and other palms which are all found only on rich moist soils,\r\nbut the noble Bacába was not uncommon, and there was a great diversity\r\nof dwarf species of Marajá palms (Bactris), one of which, called the\r\nPeuriríma, was very elegant, growing to a height of twelve or fifteen\r\nfeet, with a stem no thicker than a man’s finger. On arriving at the\r\ncampo, all this beautiful forest abruptly ceased, and we saw before us\r\nan oval tract of land three or four miles in circumference, destitute\r\neven of the smallest bush. The only vegetation was a crop of coarse\r\nhairy grass growing in patches. The forest formed a hedge all round the\r\nisolated field, and its borders were composed in great part of trees\r\nwhich do not grow in the dense virgin forest, such as a great variety\r\nof bushy Melastomas, low Byrsomina trees, myrtles, and Lacre-trees,\r\nwhose berries exude globules of wax resembling gamboge. On the margins\r\nof the campo wild pine-apples also grew in great quantity. The fruit\r\nwas of the same shape as our cultivated kind, but much smaller, the\r\nsize being that of a moderately large apple. We gathered several quite\r\nripe ones; they were pleasant to the taste, of the true pine-apple\r\nflavour, but had an abundance of fully developed seeds, and only a\r\nsmall quantity of eatable pulp. There was no path beyond this campo; in\r\nfact, all beyond is terra incognita to the inhabitants of Villa Nova.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeuririma Palm (Bactris).\r\n\r\nThe only interesting Mammalian animal which I saw at Villa Nova was a\r\nmonkey of a species new to me; it was not, however, a native of the\r\ndistrict, having been brought by a trader from the river Madeira, a few\r\nmiles above Borba. It was a howler, probably the Mycetes stramineus of\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire. The howlers are the only kinds of monkey which\r\nthe natives have not succeeded in taming. They are often caught, but\r\nthey do not survive captivity many weeks. The one of which I am\r\nspeaking was not quite full grown. It measured sixteen inches in\r\nlength, exclusive of the tail; the whole body was covered with rather\r\nlong and shining dingy-white hair, the whiskers and beard only being of\r\na tawny hue. It was kept in a house, together with a Coaitá and a\r\nCaiarára monkey (Cebus albifrons). Both these lively members of the\r\nmonkey order seemed rather to court attention, but the Mycetes slunk\r\naway when anyone approached it. When it first arrived, it occasionally\r\nmade a gruff subdued howling noise early in the morning. The deep\r\nvolume of sound in the voice of the howling monkeys, as is well known,\r\nis produced by a drum-shaped expansion of the larynx. It was curious to\r\nwatch the animal whilst venting its hollow cavernous roar, and observe\r\nhow small was the muscular exertion employed. When howlers are seen in\r\nthe forest, there are generally three or four of them mounted on the\r\ntopmost branches of a tree. It does not appear that their harrowing\r\nroar is emitted from sudden alarm; at least, it was not so in captive\r\nindividuals. It is probable, however, that the noise serves to\r\nintimidate their enemies. I did not meet with the Mycetes stramineus in\r\nany other part of the Amazons region; in the neighbourhood of Pará a\r\nreddish-coloured species prevails (M. Belzebuth); in the narrow\r\nchannels near Breves I shot a large, entirely black kind; another\r\nyellow-handed species, according to the report of the natives, inhabits\r\nthe island of Macajó, which is probably the M. flavimanus of Kuhl; some\r\ndistance up the Tapajos the only howler found is a brownish-black\r\nspecies; and on the Upper Amazons, the sole species seen was the\r\nMycetes ursinus, whose fur is of a shining yellowish-red colour.\r\n\r\nIn the dry forests of Villa Nova I saw a rattlesnake for the first\r\ntime. I was returning home one day through a narrow alley, when I heard\r\na pattering noise close to me. Hard by was a tall palm tree, whose head\r\nwas heavily weighted with parasitic plants, and I thought the noise was\r\na warning that it was about to fall. The wind lulled for a few moments,\r\nand then there was no doubt that the noise proceeded from the ground.\r\nOn turning my head in that direction, a sudden plunge startled me, and\r\na heavy gliding motion betrayed a large serpent making off almost from\r\nbeneath my feet. The ground is always so encumbered with rotting leaves\r\nand branches that one only discovers snakes when they are in the act of\r\nmoving away. The residents of Villa Nova would not believe that I had\r\nseen a rattlesnake in their neighbourhood; in fact, it is not known to\r\noccur in the forests at all, its place being the open campos, where,\r\nnear Santarem, I killed several. On my second visit to Villa Nova I saw\r\nanother. I had then a favourite little dog, named Diamante, who used to\r\naccompany me in my rambles. One day he rushed into the thicket, and\r\nmade a dead set at a large snake, whose head I saw raised above the\r\nherbage. The foolish little brute approached quite close, and then the\r\nserpent reared its tail slightly in a horizontal position and shook its\r\nterrible rattle. It was many minutes before I could get the dog away;\r\nand this incident, as well as the one already related, shows how slow\r\nthe reptile is to make the fatal spring.\r\n\r\nI was much annoyed, and at the same time amused, with the Urubú\r\nvultures. The Portuguese call them corvos or crows; in colour and\r\ngeneral appearance they somewhat resemble rooks, but they are much\r\nlarger, and have naked, black, wrinkled skin about their face and\r\nthroat. They assemble in great numbers in the villages about the end of\r\nthe wet season, and are then ravenous with hunger. My cook could not\r\nleave the kitchen open at the back of the house for a moment whilst the\r\ndinner was cooking, on account of their thievish propensities. Some of\r\nthem were always loitering about, watching their opportunity, and the\r\ninstant the kitchen was left unguarded, the bold marauders marched in\r\nand lifted the lids off the saucepans with their beaks to rob them of\r\ntheir contents. The boys of the village lie in wait, and shoot them\r\nwith bow and arrow; and vultures have consequently acquired such a\r\ndread of these weapons, that they may be often kept off by hanging a\r\nbow from the rafters of the kitchen. As the dry season advances, the\r\nhosts of Urubús follow the fishermen to the lakes, where they gorge\r\nthemselves with the offal of the fisheries. Towards February, they\r\nreturn to the villages, and are then not nearly so ravenous as before\r\ntheir summer trips.\r\n\r\nThe insects of Villa Nova are, to a great extent, the same as those of\r\nSantarem and the Tapajos. A few species of all orders, however, are\r\nfound here, which occurred nowhere else on the Amazons, besides several\r\nothers which are properly considered local varieties or races of others\r\nfound at Pará, on the Northern shore of the Amazons, or in other parts\r\nof Tropical America. The Hymenoptera were especially numerous, as they\r\nalways are in districts which possess a sandy soil: but the many\r\ninteresting facts which I gleaned relative to their habits will be more\r\nconveniently introduced when I treat of the same or similar species\r\nfound in the localities above-named. In the broad alleys of the forest\r\nseveral species of Morpho were common. One of these is a sister form to\r\nthe Morpho Hecuba, which I have mentioned as occurring at Obydos. The\r\nVilla Nova kind differs from Hecuba sufficiently to be considered a\r\ndistinct species, and has been described under the name of M. Cisseis;\r\nbut it is clearly only a local variety of it, the range of the two\r\nbeing limited by the barrier of the broad Amazons. It is a grand sight\r\nto see these colossal butterflies by twos and threes floating at a\r\ngreat height in the still air of a tropical morning. They flap their\r\nwings only at long intervals, for I have noticed them to sail a very\r\nconsiderable distance without a stroke. Their wing-muscles and the\r\nthorax to which they are attached are very feeble in comparison with\r\nthe wide extent and weight of the wings; but the large expanse of these\r\nmembers doubtless assists the insects in maintaining their aerial\r\ncourse. Morphos are amongst the most conspicuous of the insect denizens\r\nof Tropical American forests, and the broad glades of the Villa Nova\r\nwoods seemed especially suited to them, for I noticed here six species.\r\nThe largest specimens of Morpho Cisseis measure seven inches and a half\r\nin expanse. Another smaller kind, which I could not capture, was of a\r\npale silvery-blue colour, and the polished surface of its wings flashed\r\nlike a silver speculum as the insect flapped its wings at a great\r\nelevation in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nTo resume our voyage. We left Villa Nova on the 4th of December. A\r\nlight wind on the 5th carried us across to the opposite shore and past\r\nthe mouth of the Paraná-mirím do arco, or the little river of the bow,\r\nso-called on account of its being a short arm of the main river, of a\r\ncurved shape, and rejoining the Amazons a little below Villa Nova. On\r\nthe 6th, after passing a large island in mid-river, we arrived at a\r\nplace where a line of perpendicular clay cliffs, called the Barreiros\r\nde Cararaucú, diverts slightly the course of the main stream, as at\r\nObydos. A little below these cliffs were a few settlers’ houses; here\r\nPenna remained ten days to trade, a delay which I turned to good\r\naccount in augmenting very considerably my collections.\r\n\r\nAt the first house a festival was going forward. We anchored at some\r\ndistance from the shore, on account of the water being shoaly, and\r\nearly in the morning three canoes put off, laden with salt fish, oil of\r\nmanatee, fowls and bananas, wares which the owners wished to exchange\r\nfor different articles required for the festa. Soon after I went\r\nashore. The head man was a tall, well- made, civilised Tapuyo, named\r\nMarcellino, who, with his wife, a thin, active, wiry old squaw, did the\r\nhonours of their house, I thought, admirably. The company consisted of\r\nfifty or sixty Indians and Mamelucos; some of them knew Portuguese, but\r\nthe Tupí language was the only one used amongst themselves. The\r\nfestival was in honour of our Lady of Conception; and, when the people\r\nlearnt that Penna had on board an image of the saint handsomer than\r\ntheir own, they put off in their canoes to borrow it; Marcellino taking\r\ncharge of the doll, covering it carefully with a neatly-bordered white\r\ntowel. On landing with the image, a procession was formed from the port\r\nto the house, and salutes fired from a couple of lazarino guns, the\r\nsaint being afterwards carefully deposited in the family oratorio.\r\nAfter a litany and hymn were sung in the evening, all assembled to\r\nsupper around a large mat spread on a smooth terrace-like space in\r\nfront of the house. The meal consisted of a large boiled Pirarucú,\r\nwhich had been harpooned for the purpose in the morning, stewed and\r\nroasted turtle, piles of mandioca-meal and bananas. The old lady, with\r\ntwo young girls, showed the greatest activity in waiting on the guests,\r\nMarcellino standing gravely by, observing what was wanted and giving\r\nthe necessary orders to his wife. When all was done, hard drinking\r\nbegan, and soon after there was a dance, to which Penna and I were\r\ninvited. The liquor served was chiefly a spirit distilled by the people\r\nthemselves from mandioca cakes. The dances were all of the same class,\r\nnamely, different varieties of the “Landum,” an erotic dance similar to\r\nthe fandango, originally learned from the Portuguese. The music was\r\nsupplied by a couple of wire-stringed guitars, played alternately by\r\nthe young men. All passed off very quietly considering the amount of\r\nstrong liquor drunk, and the ball was kept up until sunrise the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWe visited all the houses one after the other. One of them was situated\r\nin a charming spot, with a broad sandy beach before it, at the entrance\r\nto the Paraná-mirím do Mucambo, a channel leading to an interior lake,\r\npeopled by savages of the Múra tribe. This seemed to be the abode of an\r\nindustrious family, but all the men were absent, salting Pirarucú on\r\nthe lakes. The house, like its neighbours, was simply a framework of\r\npoles thatched with palm-leaves, the walls roughly latticed and\r\nplastered with mud; but it was larger, and much cleaner inside than the\r\nothers. It was full of women and children, who were busy all day with\r\ntheir various employments; some weaving hammocks in a large clumsy\r\nframe, which held the warp whilst the shuttle was passed by the hand\r\nslowly across the six foot breadth of web; others were spinning cotton,\r\nand others again scraping, pressing, and roasting mandioca. The family\r\nhad cleared and cultivated a large piece of ground; the soil was of\r\nextraordinary richness, the perpendicular banks of the river, near the\r\nhouse, revealing a depth of many feet of crumbling vegetable mould.\r\nThere was a large plantation of tobacco, besides the usual patches of\r\nIndian-corn, sugar-cane, and mandioca; and a grove of cotton, cacao,\r\ncoffee, and fruit-trees surrounded the house. We passed two nights at\r\nanchor in shoaly water off the beach. The weather was most beautiful,\r\nand scores of Dolphins rolled and snorted about the canoe all night.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river at this point, and entered a narrow channel which\r\npenetrates the interior of the island of Tupinambarána, and leads to a\r\nchain of lakes called the Lagos de Cararaucu. A furious current swept\r\nalong the coast, eating into the crumbling earthy banks, and strewing\r\nthe river with debris of the forest. The mouth of the channel lies\r\nabout twenty-five miles from Villa Nova; the entrance is only about\r\nforty yards broad, but it expands, a short distance inland, into a\r\nlarge sheet of water. We suffered terribly from insect pests during the\r\ntwenty-four hours we remained here. At night it was quite impossible to\r\nsleep for mosquitoes; they fell upon us by myriads, and without much\r\npiping came straight at our faces as thick as raindrops in a shower.\r\nThe men crowded into the cabins, and then tried to expel the pests by\r\nthe smoke from burnt rags, but it was of little avail, although we were\r\nhalf suffocated during the operation. In the daytime, the Motúca, a\r\nmuch larger and more formidable fly than the mosquito, insisted upon\r\nlevying his tax of blood. We had been tormented by it for many days\r\npast, but this place seemed to be its metropolis. The species has been\r\ndescribed by Perty, the author of the Entomological portion of Spix,\r\nand Martius’ travels, under the name of Hadrus lepidotus. It is a\r\nmember of the Tabanidæ family, and indeed is closely related to the\r\nHæmatopota pluvialis, a brown fly which haunts the borders of woods in\r\nsummer time in England. The Motuca is of a bronzed-black colour; its\r\nproboscis is formed of a bundle of horny lancets, which are shorter and\r\nbroader than is usually the case in the family to which it belongs. Its\r\npuncture does not produce much pain, but it makes such a large gash in\r\nthe flesh that the blood trickles forth in little streams. Many scores\r\nof them were flying about the canoe all day, and sometimes eight or ten\r\nwould settle on one’s ankles at the same time. It is sluggish in its\r\nmotions, and may be easily killed with the fingers when it settles.\r\nPenna went forward in the montaria to the Pirarucu fishing stations, on\r\na lake lying further inland; but he did not succeed in reaching them on\r\naccount of the length and intricacy of the channels; so after wasting a\r\nday, during which, however, I had a profitable ramble in the forest, we\r\nagain crossed the river, and on the 16th continued our voyage along the\r\nnorthern shore.\r\n\r\nThe clay cliffs of Cararaucú are several miles in length. The hard\r\npink-and-red-coloured beds are here extremely thick, and in some places\r\npresent a compact, stony texture. The total height of the cliff is from\r\nthirty to sixty feet above the mean level of the river, and the clay\r\nrests on strata of the same coarse iron- cemented conglomerate which\r\nhas already been so often mentioned. Large blocks of this latter have\r\nbeen detached and rolled by the force of currents up parts of the cliff\r\nwhere they are seen resting on terraces of the clay. On the top of all\r\nlies a bed of sand and vegetable mold, which supports a lofty forest,\r\ngrowing up to the very brink of the precipice. After passing these\r\nbarreiros we continued our way along a low uninhabited coast, clothed,\r\nwherever it was elevated above high-water mark, with the usual\r\nvividly-coloured forests of the higher Ygapó lands, to which the broad\r\nand regular fronds of the Murumurú palm, here extremely abundant,\r\nserved as a great decoration. Wherever the land was lower than the\r\nflood height of the Amazons, Cecropia trees prevailed, sometimes\r\nscattered over meadows of tall broad-leaved grasses, which surrounded\r\nshallow pools swarming with water-fowl. Alligators were common on most\r\nparts of the coast; in some places we also saw small herds of Capybaras\r\n(a large Rodent animal, like a colossal Guinea-pig) amongst the rank\r\nherbage on muddy banks, and now and then flocks of the graceful\r\nsquirrel monkey (Chrysothrix sciureus), whilst the vivacious Caiarára\r\n(Cebus albifrons) were seen taking flying leaps from tree to tree. On\r\nthe 22nd, we passed the mouth of the most easterly of the numerous\r\nchannels which lead to the large interior lake of Saracá, and on the\r\n23rd threaded a series of passages between islands, where we again saw\r\nhuman habitations, ninety miles distant from the last house at\r\nCararaucú. On the 24th we arrived at Serpa.\r\n\r\nSerpa is a small village, consisting of about eighty houses, built on a\r\nbank elevated twenty-five feet above the level of the river. The beds\r\nof Tabatínga clay, which are here intermingled with scoria-looking\r\nconglomerate, are in some parts of the declivity prettily variegated in\r\ncolour; the name of the town in the Tupí language, Ita-coatiára, takes\r\nits origin from this circumstance, signifying striped or painted rock.\r\nIt is an old settlement, and was once the seat of the district\r\ngovernment, which had authority over the Barra of the Rio Negro. It was\r\nin 1849 a wretched-looking village, but it has since revived, on\r\naccount of having been chosen by the Steamboat Company of the Amazons\r\nas a station for steam saw-mills and tile manufactories. We arrived on\r\nChristmas Eve, when the village presented an animated appearance from\r\nthe number of people congregated for the holidays. The port was full of\r\ncanoes, large and small—from the montaria, with its arched awning of\r\nwoven lianas and Maranta leaves, to the two-masted cuberta of the\r\npeddling trader, who had resorted to the place in the hope of\r\ntrafficking with settlers coming from remote sitios to attend the\r\nfestival. We anchored close to an igarité, whose owner was an old Jurí\r\nIndian, disfigured by a large black tatooed patch in the middle of his\r\nface, and by his hair being close cropped, except a fringe in front of\r\nthe head. In the afternoon we went ashore. The population seemed to\r\nconsist chiefly of semi-civilised Indians, living as usual in\r\nhalf-finished mud hovels. The streets were irregularly laid out, and\r\noverrun with weeds and bushes swarming with “mocuim,” a very minute\r\nscarlet acarus, which sweeps off to one’s clothes in passing, and\r\nattaching itself in great numbers to the skin causes a most\r\ndisagreeable itching. The few whites and better class of mameluco\r\nresidents live in more substantial dwellings, white-washed and tiled.\r\nAll, both men and women, seemed to me much more cordial, and at the\r\nsame time more brusque in their manners, than any Brazilians I had yet\r\nmet with. One of them, Captain Manoel Joaquim, I knew for a long time\r\nafterwards; a lively, intelligent, and thoroughly good-hearted man, who\r\nhad quite a reputation throughout the interior of the country for\r\ngenerosity, and for being a firm friend of foreign residents and stray\r\ntravellers. Some of these excellent people were men of substance, being\r\nowners of trading vessels, slaves, and extensive plantations of cacao\r\nand tobacco.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at Serpa five days. Some of the ceremonies observed at\r\nChristmas were interesting, inasmuch as they were the same, with little\r\nmodification, as those taught by the Jesuit missionaries more than a\r\ncentury ago to the aboriginal tribes whom they had induced to settle on\r\nthis spot. In the morning, all the women and girls, dressed in white\r\ngauze chemises and showy calico print petticoats, went in procession to\r\nchurch, first going the round of the town to take up the different\r\n“mordomos,” or stewards, whose office is to assist the Juiz of the\r\nfesta. These stewards carried each a long white reed, decorated with\r\ncoloured ribbons; several children also accompanied, grotesquely decked\r\nwith finery. Three old squaws went in front, holding the “sairé,” a\r\nlarge semi-circular frame, clothed with cotton and studded with\r\nornaments, bits of looking-glass, and so forth. This they danced up and\r\ndown, singing all the time a monotonous whining hymn in the Tupí\r\nlanguage, and at frequent intervals turning round to face the\r\nfollowers, who then all stopped for a few moments. I was told that this\r\nsaire was a device adopted by the Jesuits to attract the savages to\r\nchurch, for these everywhere followed the mirrors, in which they saw as\r\nit were magically reflected their own persons. In the evening\r\ngood-humoured revelry prevailed on all sides. The negroes, who had a\r\nsaint of their own colour—St. Benedito—had their holiday apart from the\r\nrest, and spent the whole night singing and dancing to the music of a\r\nlong drum (gambá) and the caracashá. The drum was a hollow log, having\r\none end covered with skin, and was played by the performer sitting\r\nastride upon it, and drumming with his knuckles. The caracasha is a\r\nnotched bamboo tube, which produces a harsh rattling noise by passing a\r\nhard stick over the notches. Nothing could exceed in dreary monotony\r\nthis music and the singing and dancing, which were kept up with\r\nunflagging vigour all night long. The Indians did not get up a dance;\r\nfor the whites and mamelucos had monopolised all the pretty coloured\r\ngirls for their own ball, and the older squaws preferred looking on to\r\ntaking a part themselves. Some of their husbands joined the negroes,\r\nand got drunk very quickly. It was amusing to notice how voluble the\r\nusually taciturn redskins became under the influence of liquor. The\r\nnegroes and Indians excused their own intemperance by saying the whites\r\nwere getting drunk at the other end of the town, which was quite true.\r\n\r\nWe left Serpa on the 29th of December, in company of an old planter\r\nnamed Senhor Joao (John) Trinidade, at whose sitio, situated opposite\r\nthe mouth of the Madeira, Penna intended to spend a few days. Our\r\ncourse on the 29th and 30th lay through narrow channels between\r\nislands. On the 31st we passed the last of these, and then beheld to\r\nthe south a sea-like expanse of water, where the Madeira, the greatest\r\ntributary of the Amazons, after 2000 miles of course, blends its waters\r\nwith those of the king of rivers. I was hardly prepared for a junction\r\nof waters on so vast a scale as this, now nearly 900 miles from the\r\nsea. Whilst travelling week after week along the somewhat monotonous\r\nstream, often hemmed in between islands, and becoming thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with it, my sense of the magnitude of this vast water system\r\nhad become gradually deadened; but this noble sight renewed the first\r\nfeelings of wonder. One is inclined, in such places as these, to think\r\nthe Paraenses do not exaggerate much when they call the Amazons the\r\nMediterranean of South America. Beyond the mouth of the Madeira, the\r\nAmazons sweeps down in a majestic reach, to all appearance not a whit\r\nless in breadth before than after this enormous addition to its waters.\r\nThe Madeira does not ebb and flow simultaneously with the Amazons; it\r\nrises and sinks about two months earlier, so that it was now fuller\r\nthan the main river. Its current therefore, poured forth freely from\r\nits mouth, carrying with it a long line of floating trees and patches\r\nof grass which had been torn from its crumbly banks in the lower part\r\nof its course. The current, however, did not reach the middle of the\r\nmain stream, but swept along nearer to the southern shore.\r\n\r\nA few items of information which I gleaned relative to this river may\r\nfind a place here. The Madeira is navigable for about 480 miles from\r\nits mouth; a series of cataracts and rapids then commences, which\r\nextends, with some intervals of quiet water, about 160 miles, beyond\r\nwhich is another long stretch of navigable stream. Canoes sometimes\r\ndescend from Villa Bella, in the interior province of Matto Grosso, but\r\nnot so frequently as formerly, and I could hear of very few persons who\r\nhad attempted of late years to ascend the river to that point. It was\r\nexplored by the Portuguese in the early part of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe chief and now the only town on its banks, Borba, 150 miles from its\r\nmouth, being founded in 1756. Up to the year 1853, the lower part of\r\nthe river, as far as about a hundred miles beyond Borba, was regularly\r\nvisited by traders from Villa Nova, Serpa, and Barra, to collect\r\nsarsaparilla, copauba balsam, turtle-oil, and to trade with the\r\nIndians, with whom their relations were generally on a friendly\r\nfooting. In that year many India-rubber collectors resorted to this\r\nregion, stimulated by the high price (2s. 6d. a pound) which the\r\narticle was at that time fetching at Pará; and then the Araras, a\r\nfierce and intractable tribe of Indians, began to be troublesome. They\r\nattacked several canoes and massacred everyone on board, the Indian\r\ncrews as well as the white traders. Their plan was to lurk in ambush\r\nnear the sandy beaches where canoes stop for the night, and then fall\r\nupon the people whilst asleep. Sometimes they came under pretence of\r\nwishing to trade, and then as soon as they could get the trader at a\r\ndisadvantage, shot him and his crew from behind trees. Their arms were\r\nclubs, bows, and Taquára arrows, the latter a formidable weapon tipped\r\nwith a piece of flinty bamboo shaped like a spear-head; they could\r\npropel it with such force as to pierce a man completely through the\r\nbody. The whites of Borba made reprisals, inducing the warlike\r\nMundurucús, who had an old feud with the Aráras, to assist them. This\r\nstate of things lasted two or three years, and made a journey up the\r\nMadeira a risky undertaking, as the savages attacked all comers.\r\nBesides the Aráras and the Mundurucús, the latter a tribe friendly to\r\nthe whites, attached to agriculture, and inhabiting the interior of the\r\ncountry from the Madeira to beyond the Tapajos, two other tribes of\r\nIndians now inhabit the lower Madeira, namely, the Parentintins and the\r\nMúras. Of the former I did not hear much; the Múras lead a lazy quiet\r\nlife on the banks of the labyrinths of lakes and channels which\r\nintersect the low country on both sides of the river below Borba. The\r\nAráras are one of those tribes which do not plant mandioca; and indeed\r\nhave no settled habitations. They are very similar in stature and other\r\nphysical features to the Mundurucús, although differing from them so\r\nwidely in habits and social condition. They paint their chins red with\r\nUrucú (Anatto), and have usually a black tattooed streak on each side\r\nof the face, running from the corner of the mouth to the temple. They\r\nhave not yet learned the use of firearms, have no canoes, and spend\r\ntheir lives roaming over the interior of the country, living on game\r\nand wild fruits. When they wish to cross a river, they make a temporary\r\ncanoe with the thick bark of trees, which they secure in the required\r\nshape of a boat by means of lianas. I heard it stated by a trader of\r\nSantarem, who narrowly escaped being butchered by them in 1854, that\r\nthe Araras numbered 2000 fighting men. The number I think must be\r\nexaggerated, as it generally is with regard to Brazilian tribes. When\r\nthe Indians show a hostile disposition to the whites, I believe it is\r\nmost frequently owing to some provocation they have received at their\r\nhands; for the first impulse of the Brazilian red-man is to respect\r\nEuropeans; they have a strong dislike to be forced into their service,\r\nbut if strangers visit them with a friendly intention they are well\r\ntreated. It is related, however, that the Indians of the Madeira were\r\nhostile to the Portuguese from the first; it was then the tribes of\r\nMúras and Torazes who attacked travellers. In 1855 I met with an\r\nAmerican, an odd character named Kemp, who had lived for many years\r\namongst the Indians on the Madeira, near the abandoned settlement of\r\nCrato. He told me his neighbours were a kindly-disposed and cheerful\r\npeople, and that the onslaught of the Araras was provoked by a trader\r\nfrom Bara, who wantonly fired into a family of them, killing the\r\nparents, and carrying off their children to be employed as domestic\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nWe remained nine days at the sitio of Senhor John Trinidade. It is\r\nsituated on a tract of high Ygapó land, which is raised, however, only\r\na few inches above high-water mark. This skirts the northern shore for\r\na long distance; the soil consisting of alluvium and rich vegetable\r\nmould, and exhibiting the most exuberant fertility. Such districts are\r\nthe first to be settled on in this country, and the whole coast for\r\nmany miles was dotted with pleasant-looking sitios like that of our\r\nfriend. The establishment was a large one, the house and out-buildings\r\ncovering a large space of ground. The industrious proprietor seemed to\r\nbe Jack-of-all-trades; he was planter, trader, fisherman, and\r\ncanoe-builder, and a large igarité was now on the stocks under a large\r\nshed. There was great pleasure in contemplating this prosperous farm,\r\nfrom its being worked almost entirely by free labour; in fact, by one\r\nfamily, and its dependents. John Trinidade had only one female slave;\r\nhis other workpeople were a brother and sister-in-law, two godsons, a\r\nfree negro, one or two Indians, and a family of Múras. Both he and his\r\nwife were mamelucos; the negro children called them always father and\r\nmother. The order, abundance, and comfort about the place showed what\r\nindustry and good management could effect in this country without\r\nslave-labour. But the surplus produce of such small plantations is very\r\ntrifling. All we saw had been done since the disorders of 1835-6,\r\nduring which John Trinidade was a great sufferer; he was obliged to\r\nfly, and the Múra Indians destroyed his house and plantations. There\r\nwas a large, well-weeded grove of cacao along the banks of the river,\r\ncomprising about 8000 trees, and further inland considerable\r\nplantations of tobacco, mandioca, Indian corn, fields of rice, melons,\r\nand watermelons. Near the house was a kitchen garden, in which grew\r\ncabbages and onions, introduced from Europe, besides a wonderful\r\nvariety of tropical vegetables. It must not be supposed that these\r\nplantations and gardens were enclosed or neatly kept, such is never the\r\ncase in this country where labour is so scarce; but it was an unusual\r\nthing to see vegetables grown at all, and the ground tolerably well\r\nweeded. The space around the house was plentifully planted with\r\nfruit-trees, some, belonging to the Anonaceous order, yielding\r\ndelicious fruits large as a child’s head, and full of custardy pulp\r\nwhich it is necessary to eat with a spoon; besides oranges, lemons,\r\nguavas, alligator pears, Abíus (Achras cainito), Genipapas, and\r\nbananas. In the shade of these, coffee trees grew in great luxuriance.\r\nThe table was always well supplied with fish, which the Múra who was\r\nattached to the household as fisherman caught every morning a few\r\nhundred yards from the port. The chief kinds were the Surubim,\r\nPira-peëua, and Piramutába, three species of Siluridæ, belonging to the\r\ngenus Pimelodus. To these we used a sauce in the form of a yellow\r\npaste, quite new to me, called Arubé, which is made of the poisonous\r\njuice of the mandioca root, boiled down before the starch or tapioca is\r\nprecipitated, and seasoned with capsicum peppers. It is kept in stone\r\nbottles several weeks before using, and is a most appetising relish to\r\nfish. Tucupí, another sauce made also from mandioca juice, is much more\r\ncommon in the interior of the country than Arubé. This is made by\r\nboiling or heating the pure liquid, after the tapioca has been\r\nseparated, daily for several days in succession, and seasoning it with\r\npeppers and small fishes; when old, it has the taste of essence of\r\nanchovies. It is generally made as a liquid, but the Jurí and Miranha\r\ntribes on the Japurá make it up in the form of a black paste by a mode\r\nof preparation I could not learn; it is then called Tucupí-pixúna, or\r\nblack Tucupí. I have seen the Indians on the Tapajos, where fish is\r\nscarce, season Tucupí with Saüba ants. It is there used chiefly as a\r\nsauce to Tacacá, another preparation from mandioca, consisting of the\r\nstarch beaten up in boiling water.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the nine days we spent at this place. Our host and\r\nhostess took an interest in my pursuit; one of the best chambers in the\r\nhouse was given up to me, and the young men took me on long rambles in\r\nthe neighbouring forests. I saw very little hard work going forward.\r\nEveryone rose with the dawn, and went down to the river to bathe; then\r\ncame the never-failing cup of rich and strong coffee, after which all\r\nproceeded to their avocations. At this time, nothing was being done at\r\nthe plantations; the cacao and tobacco crops were not ripe; weeding\r\ntime was over; and the only work on foot was the preparation of a\r\nlittle farinha by the women. The men dawdled about; went shooting and\r\nfishing, or did trifling jobs about the house. The only laborious work\r\ndone during the year in these establishments is the felling of timber\r\nfor new clearings; this happens at the beginning of the dry season,\r\nnamely, from July to September. Whatever employment the people were\r\nengaged in, they did not intermit it during the hot hours of the day.\r\nThose who went into the woods took their dinners with them—a small bag\r\nof farinha, and a slice of salt fish. About sunset all returned to the\r\nhouse; they then had their frugal suppers, and towards eight o’clock,\r\nafter coming to ask a blessing of the patriarchal head of the\r\nhousehold, went off to their hammocks to sleep.\r\n\r\nThere was another visitor besides ourselves, a negro, whom John\r\nTrinidade introduced to me as his oldest and dearest friend, who had\r\nsaved his life during the revolt of 1835. I have, unfortunately,\r\nforgotten his name; he was a freeman, and had a sitio of his own\r\nsituated about a day’s journey from this. There was the same manly\r\nbearing about him that I had noticed with pleasure in many other free\r\nnegroes; but his quiet, earnest manner, and the thoughtful and\r\nbenevolent expression of his countenance, showed him to be a superior\r\nman of his class. He told me he had been intimate with our host for\r\nthirty years, and that a wry word had never passed between them. At the\r\ncommencement of the disorders of 1835, he got into the secret of a plot\r\nfor assassinating his friend, hatched by some villains whose only cause\r\nof enmity was their owing him money and envying his prosperity. It was\r\nsuch as these who aroused the stupid and brutal animosity of the Múras\r\nagainst the whites. The negro, on obtaining this news, set off alone in\r\na montaria on a six hours’ journey in the dead of night to warn his\r\n“compadre” of the fate in store for him, and thus gave him time to fly.\r\nIt was a pleasing sight to notice the cordiality of feeling and respect\r\nfor each other shown by these two old men; for they used to spend hours\r\ntogether enjoying the cool breeze, seated under a shed which overlooked\r\nthe broad river, and talking of old times.\r\n\r\nJohn Trinidade was famous for his tobacco and cigarettes, as he took\r\ngreat pains in preparing the Tauarí, or envelope, which is formed of\r\nthe inner bark of a tree, separated into thin papery layers. Many trees\r\nyield it, amongst them the Courataria Guianensis and the Sapucaya\r\nnut-tree, both belonging to the same natural order. The bark is cut\r\ninto long strips, of a breadth suitable for folding the tobacco; the\r\ninner portion is then separated, boiled, hammered with a wooden mallet,\r\nand exposed to the air for a few hours. Some kinds have a reddish\r\ncolour and an astringent taste, but the sort prepared by our host was\r\nof a beautiful satiny-white hue, and perfectly tasteless. He obtained\r\nsixty, eighty, and sometimes a hundred layers from the same strip of\r\nbark. The best tobacco in Brazil is grown in the neighbourhood of\r\nBorba, on the Madeira, where the soil is a rich black loam; but tobacco\r\nof very good quality was grown by John Trinidade and his neighbours\r\nalong this coast, on similar soil. It is made up into slender rolls, an\r\ninch and a half in diameter and six feet in length, tapering at each\r\nend. When the leaves are gathered and partially dried, layers of them,\r\nafter the mid-ribs are plucked out, are placed on a mat and rolled up\r\ninto the required shape. This is done by the women and children, who\r\nalso manage the planting, weeding, and gathering of the tobacco. The\r\nprocess of tightening the rolls is a long and heavy task, and can be\r\ndone only by men. The cords used for this purpose are of very great\r\nstrength. They are made of the inner bark of a peculiar light-wooded\r\nand slender tree, called Uaissíma, which yields, when beaten out, a\r\ngreat quantity of most beautiful silky fibre, many feet in length. I\r\nthink this might be turned to some use by English manufacturers, if\r\nthey could obtain it in large quantity. The tree is abundant on light\r\nsoils on the southern side of the Lower Amazons, and grows very\r\nrapidly. When the rolls are sufficiently well pressed, they are bound\r\nround with narrow thongs of remarkable toughness, cut from the bark of\r\nthe climbing Jacitára palm tree (Desmoncus macracanthus), and are then\r\nready for sale or use.\r\n\r\nIt was very pleasant to roam in our host’s cacaoal. The ground was\r\nclear of underwood, the trees were about thirty feet in height, and\r\nformed a dense shade. Two species of monkey frequented the trees, and I\r\nwas told committed great depredations when the fruit was ripe. One of\r\nthese, the macaco prego (Cebus cirrhifer?), is a most impudent thief;\r\nit destroys more than it eats by its random, hasty way of plucking and\r\nbreaking the fruits, and when about to return to the forest, carries\r\naway all it can in its hands or under its arms. The other species, the\r\npretty little Chrysothrix sciureus, contents itself with devouring what\r\nit can on the spot. A variety of beautiful insects basked on the\r\nfoliage where stray gleams of sunlight glanced through the canopy of\r\nbroad soft-green leaves, and numbers of an elegant, long-legged\r\ntiger-beetle (Odontocheila egregia) ran and flew about over the\r\nherbage.\r\n\r\nWe left this place on the 8th of January, and on the afternoon of the\r\n9th, arrived at Matari, a miserable little settlement of Múra Indians.\r\nHere we again anchored and went ashore. The place consisted of about\r\ntwenty slightly-built mud-hovels, and had a most forlorn appearance,\r\nnotwithstanding the luxuriant forest in its rear. A horde of these\r\nIndians settled here many years ago, on the site of an abandoned\r\nmissionary station; and the government had lately placed a resident\r\ndirector over them, with the intention of bringing the hitherto\r\nintractable savages under authority. This, however, seemed to promise\r\nno other result than that of driving them to their old solitary haunts\r\non the banks of the interior waters, for many families had already\r\nwithdrawn themselves. The absence of the usual cultivated trees and\r\nplants gave the place a naked and poverty-stricken aspect. I entered\r\none of the hovels where several women were employed cooking a meal.\r\nPortions of a large fish were roasting over a fire made in the middle\r\nof the low chamber, and the entrails were scattered about the floor, on\r\nwhich the women with their children were squatted. These had a timid,\r\ndistrustful expression of countenance, and their bodies were begrimed\r\nwith black mud, which is smeared over the skin as a protection against\r\nmosquitoes. The children were naked, the women wore petticoats of\r\ncoarse cloth, ragged round the edges, and stained in blotches with\r\nmurixí, a dye made from the bark of a tree. One of them wore a necklace\r\nof monkey’s teeth. There were scarcely any household utensils; the\r\nplace was bare with the exception of two dirty grass hammocks hung in\r\nthe corners. I missed the usual mandioca sheds behind the house, with\r\ntheir surrounding cotton, cacao, coffee, and lemon trees. Two or three\r\nyoung men of the tribe were lounging about the low open doorway. They\r\nwere stoutly-built fellows, but less well-proportioned than the\r\nsemi-civilised Indians of the Lower Amazons generally are. Their\r\nbreadth of chest was remarkable, and their arms were wonderfully thick\r\nand muscular. The legs appeared short in proportion to the trunk; the\r\nexpression of their countenances was unmistakably more sullen and\r\nbrutal, and the skin of a darker hue than is common in the Brazilian\r\nred man. Before we left the hut, an old couple came in; the husband\r\ncarrying his paddle, bow, arrows, and harpoon, the woman bent beneath\r\nthe weight of a large basket filled with palm fruits. The man was of\r\nlow stature and had a wild appearance from the long coarse hair which\r\nhung over his forehead. Both his lips were pierced with holes, as is\r\nusual with the older Múras seen on the river. They used formerly to\r\nwear tusks of the wild hog in these holes whenever they went out to\r\nencounter strangers or their enemies in war. The gloomy savagery,\r\nfilth, and poverty of the people in this place made me feel quite\r\nmelancholy, and I was glad to return to the canoe. They offered us no\r\ncivilities; they did not even pass the ordinary salutes, which all the\r\nsemi-civilised and many savage Indians proffer on a first meeting. The\r\nmen persecuted Penna for cashaça, which they seemed to consider the\r\nonly good thing the white man brings with him. As they had nothing\r\nwhatever to give in exchange, Penna declined to supply them. They\r\nfollowed us as we descended to the port, becoming very troublesome when\r\nabout a dozen had collected together. They brought their empty bottles\r\nwith them and promised fish and turtle, if we would only trust them\r\nfirst with the coveted aguardente, or cau-im, as they called it. Penna\r\nwas inexorable; he ordered the crew to weigh anchor, and the\r\ndisappointed savages remained hooting after us with all their might\r\nfrom the top of the bank as we glided away.\r\n\r\nThe Múras have a bad reputation all over this part of the Amazons, the\r\nsemi-civilised Indians being quite as severe upon them as the white\r\nsettlers. Everyone spoke of them as lazy, thievish, untrustworthy, and\r\ncruel. They have a greater repugnance than any other class of Indians\r\nto settled habits, regular labour, and the service of the whites; their\r\ndistaste, in fact, to any approximation towards civilised life is\r\ninvincible. Yet most of these faults are only an exaggeration of the\r\nfundamental defects of character in the Brazilian red man. There is\r\nnothing, I think, to show that the Múras had a different origin from\r\nthe nobler agricultural tribes belonging to the Tupí nation, to some of\r\nwhom they are close neighbours, although the very striking contrast in\r\ntheir characters and habits would suggest the conclusion that their\r\norigin had been different, in the same way as the Semangs of Malacca,\r\nfor instance, with regard to the Malays. They are merely an offshoot\r\nfrom them, a number of segregated hordes becoming degraded by a\r\nresidence most likely of very many centuries in Ygapó lands, confined\r\nto a fish diet, and obliged to wander constantly in search of food.\r\nThose tribes which are supposed to be more nearly related to the Tupís\r\nare distinguished by their settled agricultural habits, their living in\r\nwell-constructed houses, their practice of many arts, such as the\r\nmanufacture of painted earthenware, weaving, and their general custom\r\nof tattooing, social organisation, obedience to chiefs, and so forth.\r\nThe Múras have become a nation of nomade fishermen, ignorant of\r\nagriculture and all other arts practised by their neighbours. They do\r\nnot build substantial and fixed dwellings, but live in separate\r\nfamilies or small hordes, wandering from place to place along the\r\nmargins of those rivers and lakes which most abound in fish and turtle.\r\nAt each resting-place they construct temporary huts at the edge of the\r\nstream, shifting them higher or lower on the banks, as the waters\r\nadvance or recede. Their canoes originally were made simply of the\r\nthick bark of trees, bound up into a semi-cylindrical shape by means of\r\nwoody lianas; these are now rarely seen, as most families possess\r\nmontarias, which they have contrived to steal from the settlers from\r\ntime to time. Their food is chiefly fish and turtle, which they are\r\nvery expert in capturing. It is said by their neighbours that they dive\r\nafter turtles, and succeed in catching them by the legs, which I\r\nbelieve is true in the shallow lakes where turtles are imprisoned in\r\nthe dry season. They shoot fish with bow and arrow, and have no notion\r\nof any other method of cooking it than by roasting. It is not quite\r\nclear whether the whole tribe were originally quite ignorant of\r\nagriculture; as some families on the banks of the streams behind Villa\r\nNova, who could scarcely have acquired the art in recent times, plant\r\nmandioca, but, as a general rule, the only vegetable food used by the\r\nMúras is bananas and wild fruits. The original home of this tribe was\r\nthe banks of the Lower Madeira. It appears they were hostile to the\r\nEuropean settlers from the beginning; plundering their sitios,\r\nwaylaying their canoes, and massacring all who fell into their power.\r\nAbout fifty years ago, the Portuguese succeeded in turning the warlike\r\npropensities of the Mundurucús against them and these, in the course of\r\nmany years’ persecution, greatly weakened the power of the tribe, and\r\ndrove a great part of them from their seats on the banks of the\r\nMadeira. The Múras are now scattered in single hordes and families over\r\na wide extent of country bordering the main river from Villa Nova to\r\nCatuá, near Ega, a distance of 800 miles. Since the disorders of\r\n1835-6, when they committed great havoc amongst the peaceable\r\nsettlements from Santarem to the Rio Negro, and were pursued and\r\nslaughtered in great numbers by the Mundurucús in alliance with the\r\nBrazilians, they have given no serious trouble.\r\n\r\nThere is one curious custom of the Múras which requires noticing before\r\nconcluding this digression; this is the practice of snuff-taking with\r\npeculiar ceremonies. The snuff is called Paricá, and is a highly\r\nstimulating powder made from the seeds of a species of Inga, belonging\r\nto the Leguminous order of plants. The seeds are dried in the sun,\r\npounded in wooden mortars, and kept in bamboo tubes. When they are\r\nripe, and the snuff-making season sets in, they have a fuddling-bout,\r\nlasting many days, which the Brazilians call a _Quarentena_, and which\r\nforms a kind of festival of a semi-religious character. They begin by\r\ndrinking large quantities of caysúma and cashirí, fermented drinks made\r\nof various fruits and mandioca, but they prefer cashaça, or rum, when\r\nthey can get it. In a short time they drink themselves into a soddened\r\nsemi-intoxicated state, and then commence taking the Paricá. For this\r\npurpose they pair off, and each of the partners, taking a reed\r\ncontaining a quantity of the snuff, after going through a deal of\r\nunintelligible mummery, blows the contents with all his force into the\r\nnostrils of his companion. The effect on the usually dull and taciturn\r\nsavages is wonderful; they become exceedingly talkative, sing, shout,\r\nand leap about in the wildest excitement. A reaction soon follows; more\r\ndrinking is then necessary to rouse them from their stupor, and thus\r\nthey carry on for many days in succession. The Mauhés also use the\r\nParicá, although it is not known amongst their neighbours the\r\nMundurucús. Their manner of taking it is very different from that of\r\nthe swinish Múras, it being kept in the form of a paste, and employed\r\nchiefly as a preventive against ague in the months between the dry and\r\nwet seasons, when the disease prevails. When a dose is required, a\r\nsmall quantity of the paste is dried and pulverised on a flat shell,\r\nand the powder then drawn up into both nostrils at once through two\r\nvulture quills secured together by cotton thread. The use of Paricá was\r\nfound by the early travellers amongst the Omaguas, a section of the\r\nTupís who formerly lived on the Upper Amazons, a thousand miles distant\r\nfrom the homes of the Mauhés and Múras. This community of habits is one\r\nof those facts which support the view of the common origin and near\r\nrelationship of the Amazonian Indians.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Matari, we continued our voyage along the northern shore.\r\nThe banks of the river were of moderate elevation during several days’\r\njourney; the terra firma lying far in the interior, and the coast being\r\neither lowland or masked with islands of alluvial formation. On the\r\n14th we passed the upper mouth of the Parana-mirim de Eva, an arm of\r\nthe river of small breadth, formed by a straggling island some ten\r\nmiles in length, lying parallel to the northern bank. On passing the\r\nwestern end of this, the main land again appeared; a rather high rocky\r\ncoast, clothed with a magnificent forest of rounded outline, which\r\ncontinues hence for twenty miles to the mouth of the Rio Negro, and\r\nforms the eastern shore of that river. Many houses of settlers, built\r\nat a considerable elevation on the wooded heights, now enlivened the\r\nriverbanks. One of the first objects which greeted us here was a\r\nbeautiful bird we had not hitherto met with, namely, the scarlet and\r\nblack tanager (Ramphoccelus nigrogularis), flocks of which were seen\r\nsporting about the trees on the edge of the water, their flame-coloured\r\nliveries lighting up the masses of dark-green foliage.\r\n\r\nThe weather, from the 14th to the i8th, was wretched; it rained\r\nsometimes for twelve hours in succession, not heavily, but in a steady\r\ndrizzle, such as we are familiar with in our English climate. We landed\r\nat several places on the coast, Penna to trade as usual, and I to\r\nramble in the forest in search of birds and insects. In one spot the\r\nwooded slope enclosed a very picturesque scene: a brook, flowing\r\nthrough a ravine in the high bank, fell in many little cascades to the\r\nbroad river beneath, its margins decked out with an infinite variety of\r\nbeautiful plants. Wild bananas arched over the watercourse, and the\r\ntrunks of the trees in its vicinity were clothed with ferns,\r\nlarge-leaved species belonging to the genus Lygodium, which, like\r\nOsmunda, have their spore-cases collected together on contracted\r\nleaves. On the 18th, we arrived at a large fazenda (plantation and\r\ncattle farm), called Jatuarana. A rocky point here projects into the\r\nstream, and as we found it impossible to stem the strong current which\r\nwhirled around it, we crossed over to the southern shore. Canoes, in\r\napproaching the Rio Negro, generally prefer the southern side on\r\naccount of the slackness of the current near the banks. Our progress,\r\nhowever, was most tediously slow, for the regular east wind had now\r\nentirely ceased, and the vento de cima or wind from up river, having\r\ntaken its place, blew daily for a few hours dead against us. The\r\nweather was oppressively close, and every afternoon a squall arose,\r\nwhich, however, as it came from the right quarter and blew for an hour\r\nor two, was very welcome. We made acquaintance on this coast with a new\r\ninsect pest, the Piúm, a minute fly, two thirds of a line in length,\r\nwhich here commences its reign, and continues henceforward as a\r\nterrible scourge along the upper river, or Solimoens, to the end of the\r\nnavigation on the Amazons. It comes forth only by day, relieving the\r\nmosquito at sunrise with the greatest punctuality, and occurs only near\r\nthe muddy shores of the stream, not one ever being found in the shade\r\nof the forest. In places where it is abundant, it accompanies canoes in\r\nsuch dense swarms as to resemble thin clouds of smoke. It made its\r\nappearance in this way the first day after we crossed the river. Before\r\nI was aware of the presence of flies, I felt a slight itching on my\r\nneck, wrist, and ankles, and, on looking for the cause, saw a number of\r\ntiny objects having a disgusting resemblance to lice, adhering to the\r\nskin. This was my introduction to the much-talked-of Piúm. On close\r\nexamination, they are seen to be minute two-winged insects, with\r\ndark-coloured body and pale legs and wings, the latter closed\r\nlengthwise over the back. They alight imperceptibly, and squatting\r\nclose, fall at once to work; stretching forward their long front legs,\r\nwhich are in constant motion and seem to act as feelers, and then\r\napplying their short, broad snouts to the skin. Their abdomens soon\r\nbecome distended and red with blood, and then, their thirst satisfied,\r\nthey slowly move off, sometimes so stupefied with their potations that\r\nthey can scarcely fly. No pain is felt whilst they are at work, but\r\nthey each leave a small circular raised spot on the skin and a\r\ndisagreeable irritation. The latter may be avoided in great measure by\r\npressing out the blood which remains in the spot; but this is a\r\ntroublesome task when one has several hundred punctures in the course\r\nof a day. I took the trouble to dissect specimens to ascertain the way\r\nin which the little pests operate. The mouth consists of a pair of\r\nthick fleshy lips, and two triangular horny lancets, answering to the\r\nupper lip and tongue of other insects. This is applied closely to the\r\nskin, a puncture is made with the lancets, and the blood then sucked\r\nthrough between these into the oesophagus, the circular spot which\r\nresults coinciding with the shape of the lips. In the course of a few\r\ndays the red spots dry up, and the skin in time becomes blackened with\r\nthe endless number of discoloured punctures that are crowded together.\r\nThe irritation they produce is more acutely felt by some persons than\r\nothers. I once travelled with a middle-aged Portuguese, who was laid up\r\nfor three weeks from the attacks of Piúm; his legs being swelled to an\r\nenormous size, and the punctures aggravated into spreading sores.\r\n\r\nA brisk wind from the east sprang tip early in the morning of the 22nd:\r\nwe then hoisted all sail, and made for the mouth of the Rio Negro. This\r\nnoble stream at its junction with the Amazons, seems, from its\r\nposition, to be a direct continuation of the main river, whilst the\r\nSolimoens which joins at an angle and is somewhat narrower than its\r\ntributary, appears to be a branch instead of the main trunk of the vast\r\nwater system. One sees therefore at once, how the early explorers came\r\nto give a separate name to this upper part of the Amazons. The\r\nBrazilians have lately taken to applying the convenient term Alto\r\nAmazonas (High or Upper Amazons) to the Solimoens, and it is probable\r\nthat this will gradually prevail over the old name. The Rio Negro\r\nbroadens considerably from its mouth upwards, and presents the\r\nappearance of a great lake; its black-dyed waters having no current,\r\nand seeming to be dammed up by the impetuous flow of the yellow, turbid\r\nSolimoens, which here belches forth a continuous line of uprooted trees\r\nand patches of grass, and forms a striking contrast with its tributary.\r\nIn crossing, we passed the line, a little more than halfway over, where\r\nthe waters of the two rivers meet and are sharply demarcated from each\r\nother. On reaching the opposite shore, we found a remarkable change.\r\nAll our insect pests had disappeared, as if by magic, even from the\r\nhold of the canoe; the turmoil of an agitated, swiftly flowing river,\r\nand its torn, perpendicular, earthy banks, had given place to tranquil\r\nwater and a coast indented with snug little bays fringed with sloping,\r\nsandy beaches. The low shore and vivid light-green, endlessly-varied\r\nfoliage, which prevailed on the south side of the Amazons, were\r\nexchanged for a hilly country, clothed with a sombre, rounded, and\r\nmonotonous forest. Our tedious voyage now approached its termination; a\r\nlight wind carried us gently along the coast to the city of Barra,\r\nwhich lies about seven or eight miles within the mouth of the river. We\r\nstopped for an hour in a clean little bay, to bathe and dress, before\r\nshowing ourselves again amongst civilised people. The bottom was\r\nvisible at a depth of six feet, the white sand taking a brownish tinge\r\nfrom the stained but clear water. In the evening I went ashore, and was\r\nkindly received by Senhor Henriques Antony, a warm-hearted Italian,\r\nestablished here in a high position as merchant, who was the\r\nnever-failing friend of stray travellers. He placed a couple of rooms\r\nat my disposal, and in a few hours I was comfortably settled in my new\r\nquarters, sixty-four days after leaving Obydos.\r\n\r\nThe town of Barra is built on a tract of elevated, but very uneven\r\nland, on the left bank of the Rio Negro, and contained, in 1850, about\r\n3000 inhabitants. There was originally a small fort here, erected by\r\nthe Portuguese, to protect their slave-hunting expeditions amongst the\r\nnumerous tribes of Indians which peopled the banks of the river. The\r\nmost distinguished and warlike of these were the Manáos, who were\r\ncontinually at war with the neighbouring tribes, and had the custom of\r\nenslaving the prisoners made during their predatory expeditions. The\r\nPortuguese disguised their slave-dealing motives under the pretext of\r\nransoming (_resgatando_) these captives; indeed, the term _ resgatar_\r\n(to ransom) is still applied by the traders on the Upper Amazons to the\r\nvery general, but illegal, practice of purchasing Indian children of\r\nthe wild tribes. The older inhabitants of the place remember the time\r\nwhen many hundreds of these captives were brought down by a single\r\nexpedition. In 1809, Barra became the chief town of the Rio Negro\r\ndistrict; many Portuguese and Brazilians from other provinces then\r\nsettled here; spacious houses were built, and it grew, in the course of\r\nthirty or forty years, to be, next to Santarem, the principal\r\nsettlement on the banks of the Amazons. At the time of my visit it was\r\non the decline, in consequence of the growing distrust, or increased\r\ncunning, of the Indians, who once formed a numerous and the sole\r\nlabouring class, but having got to know that the laws protected them\r\nagainst forced servitude, were rapidly withdrawing themselves from the\r\nplace. When the new province of the Amazons was established, in 1852,\r\nBarra was chosen as the capital, and was then invested with the\r\nappropriate name of the city of Manáos.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the town has many advantages; the climate is healthy;\r\nthere are no insect pests; the soil is fertile and capable of growing\r\nall kinds of tropical produce (the coffee of the Rio Negro, especially,\r\nbeing of very superior quality), and it is near the fork of two great\r\nnavigable rivers. The imagination becomes excited when one reflects on\r\nthe possible future of this place, situated near the centre of the\r\nequatorial part of South America, in the midst of a region almost as\r\nlarge as Europe, every inch of whose soil is of the most exuberant\r\nfertility, and having water communication on one side with the\r\nAtlantic, and on the other with the Spanish republics of Venezuela, New\r\nGranada, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Barra is now the principal station\r\nfor the lines of steamers which were established in 1853, and\r\npassengers and goods are transhipped here for the Solimoens and Peru. A\r\nsteamer runs once a fortnight between Pará and Barra, and a bi-monthly\r\none plies between this place and Nauta in the Peruvian territory. The\r\nsteam-boat company is supported by a large annual grant, about £50,000\r\nsterling, from the imperial government. Barra was formerly a pleasant\r\nplace of residence, but it is now in a most wretched plight, suffering\r\nfrom a chronic scarcity of the most necessary articles of food. The\r\nattention of the settlers was formerly devoted almost entirely to the\r\ncollection of the spontaneous produce of the forests and rivers;\r\nagriculture was consequently neglected, and now the neighbourhood does\r\nnot produce even mandioca-meal sufficient for its own consumption. Many\r\nof the most necessary articles of food, besides all luxuries, come from\r\nPortugal, England, and North America. A few bullocks are brought now\r\nand then from Obydos, 500 miles off, the nearest place where cattle are\r\nreared in any numbers, and these furnish at long intervals a supply of\r\nfresh beef, but this is generally monopolised by the families of\r\ngovernment officials. Fowls, eggs, fresh fish, turtles, vegetables, and\r\nfruit were excessively scarce and dear in 1859, when I again visited\r\nthe place; for instance, six or seven shillings were asked for a poor\r\nlean fowl, and eggs were twopence-halfpenny a piece. In fact, the\r\nneighbourhood produces scarcely anything; the provincial government is\r\nsupplied with the greater part of its funds from the treasury of Pará;\r\nits revenue, which amounts to about fifty contos of reis (£5600),\r\nderived from export taxes on the produce of the entire province, not\r\nsufficing for more than about one-fifth of its expenditure. The\r\npopulation of the province of the Amazons, according to a census taken\r\nin 1858, is 55,000 souls; the municipal district of Barra, which\r\ncomprises a large area around the capital, containing only 4500\r\ninhabitants. For the government, however, of this small number of\r\npeople, an immense staff of officials is gathered together in the\r\ncapital, and, notwithstanding the endless number of trivial formalities\r\nwhich Brazilians employ in every small detail of administration, these\r\nhave nothing to do the greater part of their time. None of the people\r\nwho flocked to Barra on the establishment of the new government seemed\r\nto care about the cultivation of the soil and the raising of food,\r\nalthough these would have been most profitable speculations. The class\r\nof Portuguese who emigrate to Brazil seem to prefer petty trading to\r\nthe honourable pursuit of agriculture. If the English are a nation of\r\nshopkeepers, what are we to say of the Portuguese? I counted in Barra\r\none store for every five dwelling-houses. These stores, or _tavernas_,\r\nhave often not more than fifty pounds’ worth of goods for their whole\r\nstock, and the Portuguese owners, big lusty fellows, stand all day\r\nbehind their dirty counters for the sake of selling a few coppers’\r\nworth of liquors, or small wares. These men all give the same excuse\r\nfor not applying themselves to agriculture, namely, that no hands can\r\nbe obtained to work on the soil. Nothing can be done with Indians;\r\nindeed, they are fast leaving the neighbourhood altogether, and the\r\nimportation of negro slaves, in the present praiseworthy temper of the\r\nBrazilian mind, is out of the question. The problem, how to obtain a\r\nlabouring class for a new and tropical country, without slavery, has to\r\nbe solved before this glorious region can become what its delightful\r\nclimate and exuberant fertility fit it for—the abode of a numerous,\r\ncivilised, and happy people.\r\n\r\nI found at Barra my companion, Mr. Wallace, who, since our joint\r\nTocantins expedition, had been exploring, partly with his brother,\r\nlately arrived from England, the northeastern coast of Marajó, the\r\nriver Capim (a branch of the Guamá, near Pará), Monte Alegre, and\r\nSantarem. He had passed us by night below Serpa, on his way to Barra,\r\nand so had arrived about three weeks before me. Besides ourselves,\r\nthere were half-a-dozen other foreigners here congregated,—Englishmen,\r\nGermans, and Americans; one of them a Natural History collector, the\r\nrest traders on the rivers. In the pleasant society of these, and of\r\nthe family of Senhor Henriques, we passed a delightful time; the\r\nmiseries of our long river voyages were soon forgotten, and in two or\r\nthree weeks we began to talk of further explorations. Meantime we had\r\nalmost daily rambles in the neighbouring forest. The whole surface of\r\nthe land down to the water’s edge is covered by the uniform dark-green\r\nrolling forest, the _caá-apoam_ (convex woods) of the Indians,\r\ncharacteristic of the Rio Negro. This clothes also the extensive areas\r\nof lowland, which are flooded by the river in the rainy season. The\r\nolive-brown tinge of the water seems to be derived from the saturation\r\nin it of the dark green foliage during these annual inundations. The\r\ngreat contrast in form and colour between the forest of the Rio Negro\r\nand those of the Amazons arises from the predominance in each of\r\ndifferent families of plants. On the main river, palms of twenty or\r\nthirty different species form a great proportion of the mass of trees,\r\nwhilst on the Rio Negro, they play a very subordinate part. The\r\ncharacteristic kind in the latter region is the Jará (Leopoldinia\r\npulchra), a species not found on the margins of the Amazons, which has\r\na scanty head of fronds with narrow leaflets of the same dark green hue\r\nas the rest of the forest. The stem is smooth, and about two inches in\r\ndiameter; its height is not more than twelve to fifteen feet; it does\r\nnot, therefore, rise amongst the masses of foliage of the exogenous\r\ntrees, so as to form a feature in the landscape, like the broad-leaved\r\nMurumurú and Urucurí, the slender Assaí, the tall Jauarí, and the\r\nfan-leaved Murití of the banks of the Amazons. On the shores of the\r\nmain river the mass of the forest is composed, besides palms, of\r\nLeguminosæ, or trees of the bean family, in endless variety as to\r\nheight, shape of foliage, flowers, and fruit; of silk-cotton trees,\r\ncolossal nut-trees (Lecythideæ), and Cecropiæ; the underwood and\r\nwater-frontage consisting in great part of broad-leaved Musaceæ,\r\nMarantaceæ, and succulent grasses: all of which are of light shades of\r\ngreen. The forests of the Rio Negro are almost destitute of these\r\nlarge-leaved plants and grasses, which give so rich an appearance to\r\nthe vegetation wherever they grow; the margins of the stream being\r\nclothed with bushes or low trees, having the same gloomy monotonous\r\naspect as the mangroves of the shores of creeks near the Atlantic. The\r\nuniformly small but elegantly-leaved exogenous trees, which constitute\r\nthe mass of the forest, consist in great part of members of the Laurel,\r\nMyrtle, Bignoniaceous, and Rubiaceous orders. The soil is generally a\r\nstiff loam, whose chief component part is the Tabatinga clay, which\r\nalso forms low cliffs on the coast in some places, where it overlies\r\nstrata of coarse sandstone. This kind of soil and the same geological\r\nformation prevail, as we have seen, in many places on the banks of the\r\nAmazons, so that the great contrast in the forest-clothing of the two\r\nrivers cannot arise from this cause.\r\n\r\nThe forest was very pleasant for rambling. In some directions broad\r\npathways led down gentle slopes, through what one might fancy were\r\ninterminable shrubberies of evergreens, to moist hollows where springs\r\nof water bubbled up, or shallow brooks ran over their beds of clean\r\nwhite sand. But the most beautiful road was one that ran through the\r\nheart of the forest to a waterfall, which the citizens of Barra\r\nconsider as the chief natural curiosity of their neighbourhood. The\r\nwaters of one of the larger rivulets which traverse the gloomy\r\nwilderness, here fall over a ledge of rock about ten feet high. It is\r\nnot the cascade itself, but the noiseless solitude, and the marvellous\r\ndiversity and richness of trees, foliage, and flowers encircling the\r\nwater basin that form the attraction of the place. Families make picnic\r\nexcursions to this spot; and the gentlemen—it is said the ladies\r\nalso—spend the sultry hours of midday bathing in the cold and bracing\r\nwaters. The place is classic ground to the Naturalist from having been\r\na favourite spot with the celebrated travellers Spix and Martius,\r\nduring their stay at Barra in 1820. Von Martins was so much impressed\r\nby its magical beauty that he commemorated the visit by making a sketch\r\nof the scenery serve as background in one of the plates of his great\r\nwork on the palms.\r\n\r\nBirds and insects, however, were scarce amidst these charming sylvan\r\nscenes. I have often traversed the whole distance from Barra to the\r\nwaterfall, about two miles by the forest road, without seeing or\r\nhearing a bird, or meeting with so many as a score of Lepidopterous and\r\nColeopterous insects. In the thinner woods near the borders of the\r\nforest many pretty little blue and green creepers of the Dacnidæ group,\r\nwere daily seen feeding on berries; and a few very handsome birds\r\noccurred in the forest. But the latter were so rare that we could\r\nobtain them only by employing a native hunter, who used to spend a\r\nwhole day, and go a great distance to obtain two or three specimens. In\r\nthis way I obtained, amongst others, specimens of the Trogon pavoninus\r\n(the Suruquá grande of the natives), a most beautiful creature, having\r\nsoft golden green plumage, red breast, and an orange-coloured beak;\r\nalso the Ampelis Pompadoura, a rich glossy-purple chatterer with wings\r\nof a snowy-white hue.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rested some weeks in Barra, we arranged our plans for\r\nfurther explorations in the interior of the country. Mr. Wallace chose\r\nthe Rio Negro for his next trip, and I agreed to take the Solimoens. My\r\ncolleague has already given to the world an account of his journey on\r\nthe Rio Negro, and his adventurous ascent of its great tributary the\r\nUapés. I left Barra for Ega, the first town of any importance on the\r\nSolimoens, on the 26th of March, 1850. The distance is nearly 400\r\nmiles, which we accomplished in a small cuberta, manned by ten stout\r\nCucama Indians, in thirty-five days. On this occasion, I spent twelve\r\nmonths in the upper region of the Amazons; circumstances then compelled\r\nme to return to Pará. I revisited the same country in 1855, and devoted\r\nthree years and a half to a fuller exploration of its natural\r\nproductions. The results of both journeys will be given together in\r\nsubsequent chapters of this work; in the meantime, I will proceed to\r\ngive an account of Santarem and the river Tapajos, whose neighbourhoods\r\nI investigated in the years 1851-4.\r\n\r\nA few words on my visit to Pará in 1851 may be here introduced. I\r\ndescended the river from Ega, to the capital, a distance of 1400 miles,\r\nin a heavily-laden schooner belonging to a trader of the former place.\r\nThe voyage occupied no less than twenty-nine days, although we were\r\nfavoured by the powerful currents of the rainy season. The hold of the\r\nvessel was filled with turtle oil contained in large jars, the cabin\r\nwas crammed with Brazil nuts, and a great pile of sarsaparilla, covered\r\nwith a thatch of palm leaves, occupied the middle of the deck. We had,\r\ntherefore, (the master and two passengers) but rough accommodation,\r\nhaving to sleep on deck, exposed to the wet and stormy weather, under\r\nlittle toldos or arched shelters, arranged with mats of woven lianas\r\nand maranta leaves. I awoke many a morning with clothes and bedding\r\nsoaked through with the rain. With the exception, however, of a slight\r\ncold at the commencement, I never enjoyed better health than during\r\nthis journey. When the wind blew from up river or off the land, we sped\r\naway at a great rate; but it was often squally from those quarters, and\r\nthen it was not safe to hoist the sails. The weather was generally\r\ncalm, a motionless mass of leaden clouds covering the sky, and the\r\nbroad expanse of waters flowing smoothly down with no other motion than\r\nthe ripple of the current. When the wind came from below, we tacked\r\ndown the stream; sometimes it blew very strong, and then the schooner,\r\nhaving the wind abeam, laboured through the waves, shipping often heavy\r\nseas which washed everything that was loose from one side of the deck\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Pará, I found the once cheerful and healthy city\r\ndesolated by two terrible epidemics. The yellow fever, which visited\r\nthe place the previous year (1850) for the first time since the\r\ndiscovery of the country, still lingered after having carried off\r\nnearly 5 per cent of the population. The number of persons who were\r\nattacked, namely, three-fourths of the entire population, showed how\r\ngeneral the onslaught is of an epidemic on its first appearance in a\r\nplace. At the heels of this plague came the smallpox. The yellow fever\r\nhad fallen most severely on the whites and mamelucos, the negroes\r\nwholly escaping; but the smallpox attacked more especially the Indians,\r\nnegroes, and people of mixed colour, sparing the whites almost\r\nentirely, and taking off about a twentieth part of the population in\r\nthe course of the four months of its stay. I heard many strange\r\naccounts of the yellow fever. I believe Pará was the second port in\r\nBrazil attacked by it. The news of its ravages in Bahia, where the\r\nepidemic first appeared, arrived some few days before the disease broke\r\nout. The government took all the sanitary precautions that could be\r\nthought of; amongst the rest was the singular one of firing cannon at\r\nthe street corners, to purify the air. Mr. Norris, the American consul,\r\ntold me the first cases of fever occurred near the port and that it\r\nspread rapidly and regularly from house to house, along the streets\r\nwhich run from the waterside to the suburbs, taking about twenty-four\r\nhours to reach the end. Some persons related that for several\r\nsuccessive evenings before the fever broke out the atmosphere was\r\nthick, and that a body of murky vapour, accompanied by a strong stench,\r\ntravelled from street to street. This moving vapour was called the “Maî\r\nda peste” (“the mother or spirit of the plague”); and it was useless to\r\nattempt to reason them out of the belief that this was the forerunner\r\nof the pestilence. The progress of the disease was very rapid. It\r\ncommenced in April, in the middle of the wet season. In a few days,\r\nthousands of persons lay sick, dying or dead. The state of the city\r\nduring the time the fever lasted may be easily imagined. Towards the\r\nend of June it abated, and very few cases occurred during the dry\r\nseason from July to December.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the yellow fever still lingered in the place when I\r\narrived from the interior in April. I was in hopes I should escape it,\r\nbut was not so fortunate; it seemed to spare no newcomer. At the time I\r\nfell ill, every medical man in the place was worked to the utmost in\r\nattending the victims of the other epidemic; it was quite useless to\r\nthink of obtaining their aid, so I was obliged to be my own doctor, as\r\nI had been in many former smart attacks of fever. I was seized with\r\nshivering and vomit at nine o’clock in the morning. Whilst the people\r\nof the house went down to the town for the medicines I ordered, I\r\nwrapped myself in a blanket and walked sharply to and fro along the\r\nveranda, drinking at intervals a cup of warm tea, made of a bitter herb\r\nin use amongst the natives, called Pajémarióba, a leguminous plant\r\ngrowing in all waste places. About an hour afterwards, I took a good\r\ndraught of a decoction of elder blossoms as a sudorific, and soon after\r\nfell insensible into my hammock. Mr. Philipps, an English resident with\r\nwhom I was then lodging, came home in the afternoon and found me sound\r\nasleep and perspiring famously. I did not wake until almost midnight,\r\nwhen I felt very weak and aching in every bone of my body. I then took\r\nas a purgative, a small dose of Epsom salts and manna. In forty-eight\r\nhours the fever left me, and in eight days from the first attack, I was\r\nable to get about my work. Little else happened during my stay, which\r\nneed be recorded here. I shipped off all my collections to England, and\r\nreceived thence a fresh supply of funds. It took me several weeks to\r\nprepare for my second and longest journey into the interior. My plan\r\nnow was first to make Santarem headquarters for some time, and ascend\r\nfrom that place the river Tapajos as far as practicable. Afterwards I\r\nintended to revisit the marvellous country of the Upper Amazons, and\r\nwork well its natural history at various stations I had fixed upon,\r\nfrom Ega to the foot of the Andes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\nSANTAREM\r\n\r\n\r\nSituation of Santarem — Manners and Customs of the Inhabitants —\r\nClimate — Grassy Campos and Woods — Excursions to Mapirí, Mahicá, and\r\nIrurá, with Sketches of their Natural History; Palms, Wild Fruit Trees,\r\nMining Wasps, Mason Wasps, Bees, and Sloths\r\n\r\nI have already given a short account of the size, situation, and\r\ngeneral appearance of Santarem. Although containing not more than 2500\r\ninhabitants, it is the most civilised and important settlement on the\r\nbanks of the main river from Peru to the Atlantic. The pretty little\r\ntown, or city as it is called, with its rows of tolerably uniform,\r\nwhite-washed and red-tiled houses surrounded by green gardens and\r\nwoods, stands on gently sloping ground on the eastern side of the\r\nTapajos, close to its point of junction with the Amazons. A small\r\neminence on which a fort has been erected, but which is now in a\r\ndilapidated condition, overlooks the streets, and forms the eastern\r\nlimit of the mouth of the tributary. The Tapajos at Santarem is\r\ncontracted to a breadth of about a mile and a half by an accretion of\r\nlow alluvial land, which forms a kind of delta on the western side;\r\nfifteen miles further up the river is seen at its full width of from\r\nten to a dozen miles, and the magnificent hilly country, through which\r\nit flows from the south, is then visible on both shores. This high\r\nland, which appears to be a continuation of the central table-lands of\r\nBrazil, stretches almost without interruption on the eastern side of\r\nthe river down to its mouth at Santarem. The scenery as well as the\r\nsoil, vegetation, and animal tenants of this region, are widely\r\ndifferent from those of the flat and uniform country which borders the\r\nAmazons along most part of its course. After travelling week after week\r\non the main river, the aspect of Santarem with its broad white sandy\r\nbeach, limpid dark-green waters, and line of picturesque hills rising\r\nbehind over the fringe of green forest, affords an agreeable surprise.\r\nOn the main Amazons, the prospect is monotonous unless the vessel runs\r\nnear the shore, when the wonderful diversity and beauty of the\r\nvegetation afford constant entertainment. Otherwise, the unvaried,\r\nbroad yellow stream, and the long low line of forest, which dwindles\r\naway in a broken line of trees on the sea-like horizon and is renewed,\r\nreach after reach, as the voyages advances, weary by their uniformity.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Santarem on my second journey into the interior, in\r\nNovember, 1851, and made it my head-quarters for a period, as it turned\r\nout, of three years and a half. During this time I made, in pursuance\r\nof the plan I had framed, many excursions up the Tapajos, and to other\r\nplaces of interest in the surrounding region. On landing, I found no\r\ndifficulty in hiring a suitable house on the outskirts of the place. It\r\nwas pleasantly situated near the beach, going towards the aldeia or\r\nIndian part of the town. The ground sloped from the back premises down\r\nto the waterside and my little raised veranda overlooked a beautiful\r\nflower-garden, a great rarity in this country, which belonged to the\r\nneighbours. The house contained only three rooms, one with brick and\r\ntwo with boarded floors. It was substantially built, like all the\r\nbetter sort of houses in Santarem, and had a stuccoed front. The\r\nkitchen, as is usual, formed an outhouse placed a few yards distant\r\nfrom the other rooms. The rent was 12,000 reis, or about twenty-seven\r\nshillings a month. In this country, a tenant has no extra payments to\r\nmake; the owners of house property pay a dizimo or tithe, to the\r\n“collectoria geral,” or general treasury, but with this the occupier of\r\ncourse has nothing to do. In engaging servants, I had the good fortune\r\nto meet with a free mulatto, an industrious and trustworthy young\r\nfellow, named José, willing to arrange with me; the people of his\r\nfamily cooked for us, whilst he assisted me in collecting; he proved of\r\nthe greatest service in the different excursions we subsequently made.\r\nServants of any kind were almost impossible to be obtained at Santarem,\r\nfree people being too proud to hire themselves, and slaves too few and\r\nvaluable to their masters to be let out to others. These matters\r\narranged, the house put in order, and a rude table, with a few chairs,\r\nbought or borrowed to furnish the house with, I was ready in three or\r\nfour days to commence my Natural History explorations in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI found Santarem quite a different sort of place from the other\r\nsettlements on the Amazons. At Cametá, the lively, good-humoured, and\r\nplain-living Mamelucos formed the bulk of the population, the white\r\nimmigrants there, as on the Rio Negro and Upper Amazons, seeming to\r\nhave fraternised well with the aborigines. In the neighbourhood of\r\nSantarem the Indians, I believe, were originally hostile to the\r\nPortuguese; at any rate, the blending of the two races has not been\r\nhere on a large scale. I did not find the inhabitants the pleasant,\r\neasy-going, and blunt-spoken country folk that are met with in other\r\nsmall towns of the interior. The whites, Portuguese and Brazilians, are\r\na relatively more numerous class here than in other settlements, and\r\nmake great pretensions to civilisation; they are the merchants and\r\nshopkeepers of the place; owners of slaves, cattle estates, and cacao\r\nplantations. Amongst the principal residents must also be mentioned the\r\ncivil and military authorities, who are generally well-bred and\r\nintelligent people from other provinces. Few Indians live in the place;\r\nit is too civilised for them, and the lower class is made up (besides\r\nthe few slaves) of half-breeds, in whose composition negro blood\r\npredominates. Coloured people also exercise the different handicrafts;\r\nthe town supports two goldsmiths, who are mulattoes, and have each\r\nseveral apprentices; the blacksmiths are chiefly Indians, as is the\r\ncase generally throughout the province. The manners of the upper class\r\n(copied from those of Pará) are very stiff and formal, and the absence\r\nof the hearty hospitality met with in other places, produces a\r\ndisagreeable impression at first. Much ceremony is observed in the\r\nintercourse of the principal people with each other, and with\r\nstrangers. The best room in each house is set apart for receptions, and\r\nvisitors are expected to present themselves in black dress coats,\r\nregardless of the furious heat which rages in the sandy streets of\r\nSantarem towards mid-day, the hour when visits are generally made. In\r\nthe room a cane-bottomed sofa and chairs, all lacquered and gilded, are\r\narranged in quadrangular form, and here the visitors are invited to\r\nseat themselves, whilst the compliments are passed, or the business\r\narranged. In taking leave, the host backs out his guests with repeated\r\nbows, finishing at the front door. Smoking is not in vogue amongst this\r\nclass, but snuff-taking is largely indulged in, and great luxury is\r\ndisplayed in gold and silver snuff-boxes. All the gentlemen, and indeed\r\nmost of the ladies also, wear gold watches and guard chains. Social\r\nparties are not very frequent; the principal men being fully occupied\r\nwith their business and families, and the rest spending their leisure\r\nin billiard and gambling rooms, leaving wives and daughters shut up at\r\nhome. Occasionally, however, one of the principal citizens gives a\r\nball. In the first that I attended, the gentlemen were seated all the\r\nevening on one side of the room, and the ladies on the other, and\r\npartners were allotted by means of numbered cards, distributed by a\r\nmaster of the ceremonies. But the customs changed rapidly in these\r\nmatters after steamers began to run on the Amazons (in 1853), bringing\r\na flood of new ideas and fashions into the country. The old, bigoted,\r\nPortuguese system of treating women, which stifled social intercourse\r\nand wrought endless evils in the private life of the Brazilians, is now\r\nbeing gradually, although slowly, abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe religious festivals were not so numerous here as in other towns,\r\nand when they did take place, were very poor and ill attended. There is\r\na handsome church, but the vicar showed remarkably little zeal for\r\nreligion, except for a few days now and then when the Bishop came from\r\nPará on his rounds through the diocese. The people are as fond of\r\nholiday-making here as in other parts of the province; but it seemed to\r\nbe a growing fashion to substitute rational amusements for the\r\nprocessions and mummeries of the saints’ days. The young folks are very\r\nmusical, the principal instruments in use being the flute, violin,\r\nSpanish guitar, and a small four-stringed viola, called cavaquinho.\r\nDuring the early part of my stay at Santarem, a little party of\r\ninstrumentalists, led by a tall, thin, ragged mulatto, who was quite an\r\nenthusiast in his art, used frequently to serenade their friends in the\r\ncool and brilliant moonlit evenings of the dry season, playing French\r\nand Italian marches and dance music with very good effect. The guitar\r\nwas the favourite instrument with both sexes, as at Pará; the piano,\r\nhowever, is now fast superseding it. The ballads sung to the\r\naccompaniment of the guitar were not learned from written or printed\r\nmusic, but communicated orally from one friend to another. They were\r\nnever spoken of as songs, but _modinhas_, or “little fashions,” each of\r\nwhich had its day, giving way to the next favourite brought by some\r\nyoung fellow from the capital. At festival times there was a great deal\r\nof masquerading, in which all the people, old and young, white, negro,\r\nand Indian, took great delight. The best things of this kind used to\r\ncome off during the Carnival, in Easter week, and on St. John’s Eve;\r\nthe negroes having a grand semi-dramatic display in the streets at\r\nChristmas time. The more select affairs were got up by the young\r\nwhites, and coloured men associating with whites. A party of thirty or\r\nforty of these used to dress themselves in uniform style, and in very\r\ngood taste, as cavaliers and dames, each disguised with a peculiar kind\r\nof light gauze mask. The troop, with a party of musicians, went the\r\nround of their friends’ houses in the evening, and treated the large\r\nand gaily-dressed companies which were there assembled to a variety of\r\ndances. The principal citizens, in the large rooms of whose houses\r\nthese entertainments were given, seemed quite to enjoy them; great\r\npreparations were made at each place; and, after the dance, guests and\r\nmasqueraders were regaled with pale ale and sweetmeats. Once a year the\r\nIndians, with whom masked dances and acting are indigenous, had their\r\nturn, and on one occasion they gave us a great treat. They assembled\r\nfrom different parts of the neighbourhood at night, on the outskirts of\r\nthe town, and then marched through the streets by torchlight towards\r\nthe quarter inhabited by the whites, to perform their hunting and devil\r\ndances before the doors of the principal inhabitants. There were about\r\na hundred men, women, and children in the procession. Many of the men\r\nwere dressed in the magnificent feather crowns, tunics, and belts,\r\nmanufactured by the Mundurucús, and worn by them on festive occasions,\r\nbut the women were naked to the waist, and the children quite naked,\r\nand all were painted and smeared red with anatto. The ringleader\r\nenacted the part of the Tushaua, or chief, and carried a sceptre,\r\nrichly decorated with the orange, red, and green feathers of toucans\r\nand parrots. The pajé or medicine-man came along, puffing at a long\r\ntauarí cigar, the instrument by which he professes to make his\r\nwonderful cures. Others blew harsh, jarring blasts with the turé, a\r\nhorn made of long and thick bamboo, with a split reed in the\r\nmouthpiece. This is the war trumpet of many tribes of Indians, with\r\nwhich the sentinels of predatory hordes, mounted on a lofty tree, gave\r\nthe signal for attack to their comrades. Those Brazilians who are old\r\nenough to remember the times of warfare between Indians and settlers,\r\nretain a great horror of the turé, its loud, harsh note heard in the\r\ndead of the night having been often the prelude to an onslaught of\r\nbloodthirsty Múras on the outlying settlements. The rest of the men in\r\nthe procession carried bows and arrows, bunches of javelins, clubs, and\r\npaddles. The older children brought with them the household pets; some\r\nhad monkeys or coatis on their shoulders, and others bore tortoises on\r\ntheir heads. The squaws carried their babies in aturas, or large\r\nbaskets, slung on their backs, and secured with a broad belt of bast\r\nover their foreheads. The whole thing was accurate in its\r\nrepresentation of Indian life, and showed more ingenuity than some\r\npeople give the Brazilian red man credit for. It was got up\r\nspontaneously by the Indians, and simply to amuse the people of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe people seem to be thoroughly alive to the advantages of education\r\nfor their children. Besides the usual primary schools, one for girls,\r\nand another for boys, there is a third of a higher class, where Latin\r\nand French, amongst other accomplishments, are taught by professors,\r\nwho, like the common schoolmasters, are paid by the provincial\r\ngovernment. This is used as a preparatory school to the Lyceum and\r\nBishop’s seminary, well-endowed institutions at Pará, whither it is the\r\nambition of traders and planters to send their sons to finish their\r\nstudies. The rudiments of education only are taught in the primary\r\nschools, and it is surprising how quickly and well the little lads,\r\nboth coloured and white, learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. But\r\nthe simplicity of the Portuguese language, which is written as it is\r\npronounced, or according to unvarying rules, and the use of the decimal\r\nsystem of accounts, make these acquirements much easier than they are\r\nwith us. Students in the superior school have to pass an examination\r\nbefore they can be admitted at the colleges in Pará, and the managers\r\nonce did me the honour to make me one of the examiners for the year.\r\nThe performances of the youths, most of whom were under fourteen years\r\nof age, were very creditable, especially in grammar; there was a\r\nquickness of apprehension displayed which would have gladdened the\r\nheart of a northern schoolmaster. The course of study followed at the\r\ncolleges of Pará must be very deficient; for it is rare to meet with an\r\neducated Paraense who has the slightest knowledge of the physical\r\nsciences, or even of geography, if he has not travelled out of the\r\nprovince. The young men all become smart rhetoricians and lawyers; any\r\nof them is ready to plead in a law case at an hour’s notice; they are\r\nalso great at statistics, for the gratification of which taste there is\r\nample field in Brazil, where every public officer has to furnish\r\nvolumes of dry reports annually to the government; but they are\r\nwoefully ignorant on most other subjects. I do not recollect seeing a\r\nmap of any kind at Santarem. The quick-witted people have a suspicion\r\nof their deficiencies in this respect, and it is difficult to draw them\r\nout on geography; but one day a man holding an important office\r\nbetrayed himself by asking me, “On what side of the river was Paris\r\nsituated?” This question did not arise, as might be supposed, from a\r\ndesire for accurate topographical knowledge of the Seine, but from the\r\nidea, that all the world was a great river, and that the different\r\nplaces he had heard of must lie on one shore or the other. The fact of\r\nthe Amazons being a limited stream, having its origin in narrow\r\nrivulets, its beginning and its ending, has never entered the heads of\r\nmost of the people who have passed their whole lives on its banks.\r\n\r\nSantarem is a pleasant place to live in, irrespective of its society.\r\nThere are no insect pests, mosquito, pium, sand-fly, or motuca. The\r\nclimate is glorious; during six months of the year, from August to\r\nFebruary, very little rain falls, and the sky is cloudless for weeks\r\ntogether, the fresh breezes from the sea, nearly 400 miles distant,\r\nmoderating the great heat of the sun. The wind is sometimes so strong\r\nfor days together, that it is difficult to make way against it in\r\nwalking along the streets, and it enters the open windows and doors of\r\nhouses, scattering loose clothing and papers in all directions. The\r\nplace is considered healthy; but at the changes of season, severe colds\r\nand ophthalmia are prevalent. I found three Englishmen living here, who\r\nhad resided many years in the town or its neighbourhood, and who still\r\nretained their florid complexions; the plump and fresh appearance of\r\nmany of the middle-aged Santarem ladies also bore testimony to the\r\nhealthfulness of the climate. The streets are always clean and dry,\r\neven in the height of the wet season; good order is always kept, and\r\nthe place pretty well supplied with provisions. None but those who have\r\nsuffered from the difficulty of obtaining the necessities of life at\r\nany price in most of the interior settlements of South America, can\r\nappreciate the advantages of Santarem in this respect. Everything,\r\nhowever, except meat, was dear, and becoming every year more so. Sugar,\r\ncoffee, and rice, which ought to be produced in surplus in the\r\nneighbourhood, are imported from other provinces, and are high in\r\nprice; sugar, indeed, is a little dearer here than in England. There\r\nwere two or three butchers’ shops, where excellent beef could be had\r\ndaily at twopence or twopence-halfpenny per pound. The cattle have not\r\nto be brought from a long distance as at Pará, being bred on the\r\ncampos, which border the Lago Grande, only one or two days’ journey\r\nfrom the town. Fresh fish could be bought in the port on most evenings,\r\nbut as the supply did not equal the demand, there was always a race\r\namongst purchasers to the waterside when the canoe of a fisherman hove\r\nin sight. Very good bread was hawked round the town every morning, with\r\nmilk, and a great variety of fruits and vegetables. Amongst the fruits,\r\nthere was a kind called atta, which I did not see in any other part of\r\nthe country. It belongs to the Anonaceous order, and the tree which\r\nproduces it grows apparently wild in the neighbourhood of Santarem. It\r\nis a little larger than a good-sized orange, and the rind, which\r\nencloses a mass of rich custardy pulp, is scaled like the pineapple,\r\nbut green when ripe, and encrusted on the inside with sugar. To finish\r\nthis account of the advantages of Santarem, the delicious bathing in\r\nthe clear waters of the Tapajos may be mentioned. There is here no fear\r\nof alligators; when the east wind blows, a long swell rolls in on the\r\nclean sandy beach, and the bath is most exhilarating.\r\n\r\nThe country around Santarem is not clothed with dense and lofty forest\r\nlike the rest of the great humid river plain of the Amazons. It is a\r\ncampo region; a slightly elevated and undulating tract of land, wooded\r\nonly in patches, or with single scattered trees. A good deal of the\r\ncountry on the borders of the Tapajos, which flows from the great campo\r\narea of interior Brazil, is of this description. It is on this account\r\nthat I consider the eastern side of the river, towards its mouth, to be\r\na northern prolongation of the continental land, and not a portion of\r\nthe alluvial flats of the Amazons. The soil is a coarse gritty sand;\r\nthe substratum, which is visible in some places, consisting of\r\nsandstone conglomerate probably of the same formation as that which\r\nunderlies the Tabatinga clay in other parts of the river valley. The\r\nsurface is carpeted with slender hairy grasses, unfit for pasture,\r\ngrowing to a uniform height of about a foot. The patches of wood look\r\nlike copses in the middle of green meadows; they are called by the\r\nnatives “ilhas de mato,” or islands of jungle; the name being, no\r\ndoubt, suggested by their compactness of outline, neatly demarcated in\r\ninsular form from the smooth carpet of grass, around them. They are\r\ncomposed of a great variety of trees loaded with succulent parasites,\r\nand lashed together by woody climbers like the forest in other parts. A\r\nnarrow belt of dense wood, similar in character to these ilhas, and\r\nlike them sharply limited along its borders, runs everywhere parallel\r\nand close to the river. In crossing the campo, the path from the town\r\nascends a little for a mile or two, passing through this marginal strip\r\nof wood; the grassy land then slopes gradually to a broad valley,\r\nwatered by rivulets, whose banks are clothed with lofty and luxuriant\r\nforest. Beyond this, a range of hills extends as far as the eye can\r\nreach towards the yet untrodden interior. Some of these hills are long\r\nridges, wooded or bare; others are isolated conical peaks, rising\r\nabruptly from the valley. The highest are probably not more than a\r\nthousand feet above the level of the river. One remarkable hill, the\r\nSerra de Muruarú, about fifteen miles from Santarem, which terminates\r\nthe prospect to the south, is of the same truncated pyramidal form as\r\nthe range of hills near Almeyrim. Complete solitude reigns over the\r\nwhole of this stretch of beautiful country. The inhabitants of Santarem\r\nknow nothing of the interior, and seem to feel little curiosity\r\nconcerning it. A few tracks from the town across the campo lead to some\r\nsmall clearings four or five miles off, belonging to the poorer\r\ninhabitants of the place; but, excepting these, there are no roads, or\r\nsigns of the proximity of a civilised settlement.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the campos changes very much according to the season.\r\nThere is not that grand uniformity of aspect throughout the year which\r\nis observed in the virgin forest, and which makes a deeper impression\r\non the naturalist the longer he remains in this country. The seasons in\r\nthis part of the Amazons region are sharply contrasted, but the\r\ndifference is not so great as in some tropical countries, where, during\r\nthe dry monsoon, insects and reptiles go into a summer sleep, and the\r\ntrees simultaneously shed their leaves. As the dry season advances\r\n(August, September), the grass on the campos withers, and the shrubby\r\nvegetation near the town becomes a mass of parched yellow stubble. The\r\nperiod, however, is not one of general torpidity or repose for animal\r\nor vegetable life. Birds certainly are not so numerous as in the wet\r\nseason, but some kinds remain and lay their eggs at this time—for\r\ninstance, the ground doves (Chamæpelia). The trees retain their verdure\r\nthroughout, and many of them flower in the dry months. Lizards do not\r\nbecome torpid, and insects are seen both in the larva and the perfect\r\nstates, showing that the aridity of the climate has not a general\r\ninfluence on the development of the species. Some kinds of butterflies,\r\nespecially the little hairstreaks (Theclæ), whose caterpillars feed on\r\nthe trees, make their appearance only when the dry season is at its\r\nheight. The land molluscs of the district are the only animals which\r\næstivate; they are found in clusters, Bulimi and Helices, concealed in\r\nhollow trees, the mouths of their shells closed by a film of mucus. The\r\nfine weather breaks up often with great suddenness about the beginning\r\nof February. Violent squalls from the west or the opposite direction to\r\nthe trade-wind then occur. They give very little warning, and the first\r\ngenerally catches the people unprepared. They fall in the night, and\r\nblowing directly into the harbour, with the first gust sweep all\r\nvessels from their anchorage; in a few minutes a mass of canoes, large\r\nand small, including schooners of fifty tons burthen, are clashing\r\ntogether, pell-mell, on the beach. I have reason to remember these\r\nstorms, for I was once caught in one myself, whilst crossing the river\r\nin an undecked boat about a day’s journey from Santarem. They are\r\naccompanied with terrific electric explosions, the sharp claps of\r\nthunder falling almost simultaneously with the blinding flashes of\r\nlightning. Torrents of rain follow the first outbreak; the wind then\r\ngradually abates, and the rain subsides into a steady drizzle, which\r\ncontinues often for the greater part of the succeeding day. After a\r\nweek or two of showery weather, the aspect of the country is completely\r\nchanged. The parched ground in the neighbourhood of Santarem breaks\r\nout, so to speak, in a rash of greenery; the dusty, languishing trees\r\ngain, without having shed their old leaves, a new clothing of tender\r\ngreen foliage; a wonderful variety of quick-growing leguminous plants\r\nsprings up; and leafy creepers overrun the ground, the bushes, and the\r\ntrunks of trees. One is reminded of the sudden advent of spring after a\r\nfew warm showers in northern climates; I was the more struck by it as\r\nnothing similar is witnessed in the virgin forests amongst which I had\r\npassed the four years previous to my stay in this part. The grass on\r\nthe campos is renewed, and many of the campo trees, especially the\r\nmyrtles, which grow abundantly in one portion of the district, begin to\r\nflower, attracting by the fragrance of their blossoms a great number\r\nand variety of insects, more particularly Coleoptera. Many kinds of\r\nbirds; parrots, toucans, and barbets, which live habitually in the\r\nforest, then visit the open places. A few weeks of comparatively dry\r\nweather generally intervene in March, after a month or two of rain. The\r\nheaviest rains fall in April, May, and June; they come in a succession\r\nof showers, with sunny, gleamy weather in the intervals. June and July\r\nare the months when the leafy luxuriance of the campos, and the\r\nactivity of life, are at their highest. Most birds have then completed\r\ntheir moulting, which extends over the period from February to May. The\r\nflowering shrubs are then mostly in bloom, and numberless kinds of\r\nDipterous and Hymenopterous insects appear simultaneously with the\r\nflowers. This season might be considered the equivalent of summer in\r\ntemperate climates, as the bursting forth of the foliage in February\r\nrepresents the spring; but under the equator there is not that\r\nsimultaneous march in the annual life of animals and plants, which we\r\nsee in high latitudes; some species, it is true, are dependent upon\r\nothers in their periodical acts of life, and go hand-in-hand with them,\r\nbut they are not all simultaneously and similarly affected by the\r\nphysical changes of the seasons.\r\n\r\nI will now give an account of some of my favourite collecting places in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Santarem, incorporating with the description a few\r\nof the more interesting observations made on the Natural History of the\r\nlocalities. To the west of the town there was a pleasant path along the\r\nbeach to a little bay, called Mapirí, about five miles within the mouth\r\nof the Tapajos. The road was practicable only in the dry season. The\r\nriver at Santarem rises on the average about thirty feet, varying in\r\ndifferent years about ten feet, so that in the four months from April\r\nto July, the water comes up to the edge of the marginal belt of wood\r\nalready spoken of. This Mapiri excursion was most pleasant and\r\nprofitable in the months from January to March, before the rains became\r\ntoo continuous. The sandy beach beyond the town is very irregular, in\r\nsome places forming long spits on which, when the east wind is blowing,\r\nthe waves break in a line of foam; at others, receding to shape out\r\nquiet little bays and pools. On the outskirts of the town a few\r\nscattered huts of Indians and coloured people are passed, prettily\r\nsituated on the margin of the white beach, with a background of\r\nglorious foliage; the cabin of the pure-blood Indian being\r\ndistinguished from the mud hovels of the free negroes and mulattoes by\r\nits light construction, half of it being an open shed where the dusky\r\ntenants are seen at all hours of the day lounging in their open-meshed\r\ngrass hammocks. About two miles on the road we come to a series of\r\nshallow pools, called the Laguinhos, which are connected with the river\r\nin the wet season, but separated from it by a high bank of sand topped\r\nwith bushes at other times. There is a break here in the fringe of\r\nwood, and a glimpse is obtained of the grassy campo. When the waters\r\nhave risen to the level of the pools, this place is frequented by many\r\nkinds of wading-birds. Snow-white egrets of two species stand about the\r\nmargins of the water, and dusky-striped herons may be seen half hidden\r\nunder the shade of the bushes. The pools are covered with a small kind\r\nof water-lily, and surrounded by a dense thicket. Amongst the birds\r\nwhich inhabit this spot is the rosy-breasted Troupial (Trupialis\r\nGulanensis), a bird resembling our starling in size and habits, and not\r\nunlike it in colour, with the exception of the rich rosy vest. The\r\nwater at this time of the year overflows a large level tract of campo\r\nbordering the pools, and the Troupials come to feed on the larvæ of\r\ninsects which then abound in the moist soil.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Laguinhos there succeeds a tract of level beach covered with\r\ntrees which form a beautiful grove. About the month of April, when the\r\nwater rises to this level, the trees are covered with blossom, and a\r\nhandsome orchid, an Epidendron with large white flowers, which clothes\r\nthickly the trunks, is profusely in bloom. Several kinds of kingfisher\r\nresort to the place. Four species may be seen within a small space: the\r\nlargest as big as a crow, of a mottled-grey hue, and with an enormous\r\nbeak; the smallest not larger than a sparrow. The large one makes its\r\nnest in clay cliffs, three or four miles distant from this place. None\r\nof the kingfishers are so brilliant in colour as our English species.\r\nThe blossoms on the trees attract two or three species of hummingbirds,\r\nthe most conspicuous of which is a large swallow-tailed kind\r\n(Eupetomena macroura), with a brilliant livery of emerald green and\r\nsteel blue. I noticed that it did not remain so long poised in the air\r\nbefore the flowers as the other smaller species; it perched more\r\nfrequently, and sometimes darted after small insects on the wing.\r\nEmerging from the grove there is a long stretch of sandy beach; the\r\nland is high and rocky, and the belt of wood which skirts the river\r\nbanks is much broader than it is elsewhere. At length, after rounding a\r\nprojecting bluff, the bay at Mapirí is reached. The river view is\r\ncharacteristic of the Tapajos; the shores are wooded, and on the\r\nopposite side is a line of clay cliffs with hills in the background\r\nclothed with a rolling forest. A long spit of sand extends into\r\nmid-river, beyond which is an immense expanse of dark water, the\r\nfurther shore of the Tapajos being barely visible as a thin grey line\r\nof trees on the horizon. The transparency of air and water in the dry\r\nseason when the brisk east wind is blowing, and the sharpness of\r\noutline of hills, woods, and sandy beaches, give a great charm to this\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nWhilst resting in the shade during the great heat of the early hours of\r\nafternoon, I used to find amusement in watching the proceedings of the\r\nsand wasps. A small pale green kind of Bembex (Bembex ciliata), was\r\nplentiful near the bay of Mapirí. When they are at work, a number of\r\nlittle jets of sand are seen shooting over the surface of the sloping\r\nbank. The little miners excavate with their forefeet, which are\r\nstrongly built and furnished with a fringe of stiff bristles; they work\r\nwith wonderful rapidity, and the sand thrown out beneath their bodies\r\nissues in continuous streams. They are solitary wasps, each female\r\nworking on her own account. After making a gallery two or three inches\r\nin length in a slanting direction from the surface, the owner backs out\r\nand takes a few turns round the orifice apparently to see whether it is\r\nwell made, but in reality, I believe, to take note of the locality,\r\nthat she may find it again. This done, the busy workwoman flies away;\r\nbut returns, after an absence varying in different cases from a few\r\nminutes to an hour or more, with a fly in her grasp, with which she\r\nre-enters her mine. On again emerging, the entrance is carefully closed\r\nwith sand. During this interval she has laid an egg on the body of the\r\nfly which she had previously benumbed with her sting, and which is to\r\nserve as food for the soft, footless grub soon to be hatched from the\r\negg. From what I could make out, the Bembex makes a fresh excavation\r\nfor every egg to be deposited; at least in two or three of the\r\ngalleries which I opened there was only one fly enclosed.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Bembex on leaving her mine took note of the\r\nlocality; this seemed to be the explanation of the short delay previous\r\nto her taking flight; on rising in the air also the insects generally\r\nflew round over the place before making straight off. Another nearly\r\nallied but much larger species, the Monedula signata, whose habits I\r\nobserved on the banks of the Upper Amazons, sometimes excavates its\r\nmine solitarily on sand-banks recently laid bare in the middle of the\r\nriver, and closes the orifice before going in search of prey. In these\r\ncases the insect has to make a journey of at least half a mile to\r\nprocure the kind of fly, the Motúca (Hadrus lepidotus), with which it\r\nprovisions its cell. I often noticed it to take a few turns in the air\r\nround the place before starting; on its return it made without\r\nhesitation straight for the closed mouth of the mine. I was convinced\r\nthat the insects noted the bearings of their nests and the direction\r\nthey took in flying from them. The proceeding in this and similar cases\r\n(I have read of something analogous having been noticed in hive bees)\r\nseems to be a mental act of the same nature as that which takes place\r\nin ourselves when recognising a locality. The senses, however, must be\r\nimmeasurably more keen and the mental operation much more certain in\r\nthem than it is in man, for to my eye there was absolutely no landmark\r\non the even surface of sand which could serve as guide, and the borders\r\nof the forest were not nearer than half a mile. The action of the wasp\r\nwould be said to be instinctive; but it seems plain that the instinct\r\nis no mysterious and unintelligible agent, but a mental process in each\r\nindividual, differing from the same in man only by its unerring\r\ncertainty. The mind of the insect appears to be so constituted that the\r\nimpression of external objects or the want felt, causes it to act with\r\na precision which seems to us like that of a machine constructed to\r\nmove in a certain given way. I have noticed in Indian boys a sense of\r\nlocality almost as keen as that possessed by the sand-wasp. An old\r\nPortuguese and myself, accompanied by a young lad about ten years of\r\nage, were once lost in the forest in a most solitary place on the banks\r\nof the main river. Our case seemed hopeless, and it did not for some\r\ntime occur to us to consult our little companion, who had been playing\r\nwith his bow and arrow all the way whilst we were hunting, apparently\r\ntaking no note of the route. When asked, however, he pointed out, in a\r\nmoment, the right direction of our canoe. He could not explain how he\r\nknew; I believe he had noted the course we had taken almost\r\nunconsciously; the sense of locality in his case seemed instinctive.\r\n\r\nThe Monedula signata is a good friend to travellers in those parts of\r\nthe Amazons which are infested by the blood-thirsty Motúca. I first\r\nnoticed its habit of preying on this fly one day when we landed to make\r\nour fire and dine on the borders of the forest adjoining a sand-bank.\r\nThe insect is as large as a hornet, and has a most waspish appearance.\r\nI was rather startled when one out of the flock which was hovering\r\nabout us flew straight at my face: it had espied a Motuca on my neck\r\nand was thus pouncing upon it. It seizes the fly not with its jaws, but\r\nwith its fore and middle feet, and carries it off tightly held to its\r\nbreast. Wherever the traveller lands on the Upper Amazons in the\r\nneighbourhood of a sand-bank he is sure to be attended by one or more\r\nof these useful vermin-killers.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Mapirí was the limit of my day excursions by the river-side\r\nto the west of Santarem. A person may travel, however, on foot, as\r\nIndians frequently do, in the dry season for fifty or sixty miles along\r\nthe broad clean sandy beaches of the Tapajos. The only obstacles are\r\nthe rivulets, most of which are fordable when the waters are low. To\r\nthe east my rambles extended to the banks of the Mahicá inlet. This\r\nenters the Amazons about three miles below Santarem, where the clear\r\nstream of the Tapajos begins to be discoloured by the turbid waters of\r\nthe main river. The Mahicá has a broad margin of rich level pasture,\r\nlimited on each side by the straight, tall hedge of forest. On the\r\nSantarem side it is skirted by high wooded ridges. A landscape of this\r\ndescription always produced in me an impression of sadness and\r\nloneliness which the luxuriant virgin forests that closely hedge in\r\nmost of the by-waters of the Amazons never created. The pastures are\r\ndestitute of flowers, and also of animal life, with the exception of a\r\nfew small plain-coloured birds and solitary Caracára eagles whining\r\nfrom the topmost branches of dead trees on the forest borders. A few\r\nsettlers have built their palm- thatched and mud-walled huts on the\r\nbanks of the Mahicá, and occupy themselves chiefly in tending small\r\nherds of cattle. They seemed to be all wretchedly poor. The oxen\r\nhowever, though small, were sleek and fat, and the district most\r\npromising for agricultural and pastoral employments. In the wet season\r\nthe waters gradually rise and cover the meadows, but there is plenty of\r\nroom for the removal of the cattle to higher ground. The lazy and\r\nignorant people seem totally unable to profit by these advantages. The\r\nhouses have no gardens or plantations near them. I was told it was\r\nuseless to plant anything, because the cattle devoured the young\r\nshoots. In this country, grazing and planting are very rarely carried\r\non together, for the people seem to have no notion of enclosing patches\r\nof ground for cultivation. They say it is too much trouble to make\r\nenclosures. The construction of a durable fence is certainly a\r\ndifficult matter, for it is only two or three kinds of tree which will\r\nserve the purpose in being free from the attacks of insects, and these\r\nare scattered far and wide through the woods.\r\n\r\nAlthough the meadows were unproductive ground to a naturalist, the\r\nwoods on their borders teemed with life; the number and variety of\r\ncurious insects of all orders which occurred here was quite wonderful.\r\nThe belt of forest was intersected by numerous pathways leading from\r\none settler’s house to another. The ground was moist, but the trees\r\nwere not so lofty or their crowns so densely packed together as in\r\nother parts; the sun’s light and heat, therefore, had freer access to\r\nthe soil, and the underwood was much more diversified than in the\r\nvirgin forest. I never saw so many kinds of dwarf palms together as\r\nhere; pretty miniature species; some not more than five feet high, and\r\nbearing little clusters of round fruit not larger than a good bunch of\r\ncurrants. A few of the forest trees had the size and strongly-branched\r\nfigures of our oaks, and a similar bark. One noble palm grew here in\r\ngreat abundance, and gave a distinctive character to the district. This\r\nwas the Œnocarpus distichus, one of the kinds called Bacába by the\r\nnatives. It grows to a height of forty to fifty feet. The crown is of a\r\nlustrous dark-green colour, and of a singularly flattened or compressed\r\nshape, the leaves being arranged on each side in nearly the same plane.\r\nWhen I first saw this tree on the campos, where the east wind blows\r\nwith great force night and day for several months, I thought the shape\r\nof the crown was due to the leaves being prevented from radiating\r\nequally by the constant action of the breezes. But the plane of growth\r\nis not always in the direction of the wind, and the crown has the same\r\nshape when the tree grows in the sheltered woods. The fruit of this\r\nfine palm ripens towards the end of the year, and is much esteemed by\r\nthe natives, who manufacture a pleasant drink from it similar to the\r\nassai described in a former chapter, by rubbing off the coat of pulp\r\nfrom the nuts, and mixing it with water. A bunch of fruit weighs thirty\r\nor forty pounds. The beverage has a milky appearance, and an agreeable\r\nnutty flavour. The tree is very difficult to climb, on account of the\r\nsmoothness of its stem; consequently the natives, whenever they want a\r\nbunch of fruit for a bowl of Bacába, cut down and thus destroy a tree\r\nwhich has taken a score or two of years to grow, in order to get at it.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the Mahicá woods, towards the river, there is a\r\nbed of stiff white clay, which supplies the people of Santarem with\r\nmaterial for the manufacture of coarse pottery and cooking utensils:\r\nall the kettles, saucepans, mandioca ovens, coffee-pots,\r\nwashing-vessels, and so forth, of the poorer classes, throughout the\r\ncountry, are made of this same plastic clay, which occurs at short\r\nintervals over the whole surface of the Amazons valley, from the\r\nneighbourhood of Pará to within the Peruvian borders, and forms part of\r\nthe great Tabatinga marl deposit. To enable the vessels to stand the\r\nfire, the bark of a certain tree, called Caraipé, is burned and mixed\r\nwith the clay, which gives tenacity to the ware. Caraipé is an article\r\nof commerce, being sold, packed in baskets, at the shops in most of the\r\ntowns. The shallow pits, excavated in the marly soil at Mahicá, were\r\nvery attractive to many kinds of mason bees and wasps, who made use of\r\nthe clay to build their nests with. So we have here another example of\r\nthe curious analogy that exists between the arts of insects and those\r\nof man. I spent many an hour watching their proceedings; a short\r\naccount of the habits of some of these busy creatures may be\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPelopæus Wasp building nest.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous was a large yellow and black wasp, with a\r\nremarkably long and narrow waist, the Pelopæus fistularis. This species\r\ncollected the clay in little round pellets, which it carried off, after\r\nrolling them into a convenient shape, in its mouth. It came straight to\r\nthe pit with a loud hum, and, on alighting, lost not a moment in\r\nbeginning to work; finishing the kneading of its little load in two or\r\nthree minutes. The nest of this wasp is shaped like a pouch, two inches\r\nin length, and is attached to a branch or other projecting object. One\r\nof these restless artificers once began to build on the handle of a\r\nchest in the cabin of my canoe, when we were stationary at a place for\r\nseveral days. It was so intent on its work that it allowed me to\r\ninspect the movements of its mouth with a lens whilst it was laying on\r\nthe mortar. Every fresh pellet was brought in with a triumphant song,\r\nwhich changed to a cheerful busy hum when it alighted and began to\r\nwork. The little ball of moist clay was laid on the edge of the cell,\r\nand then spread out around the circular rim by means of the lower lip\r\nguided by the mandibles. The insect placed itself astride over the rim\r\nto work, and, on finishing each addition to the structure, took a turn\r\nround, patting the sides with its feet inside and out before flying off\r\nto gather a fresh pellet. It worked only in sunny weather, and the\r\nprevious layer was sometimes not quite dry when the new coating was\r\nadded. The whole structure takes about a week to complete. I left the\r\nplace before the gay little builder had quite finished her task; she\r\ndid not accompany the canoe, although we moved along the bank of the\r\nriver very slowly. On opening closed nests of this species, which are\r\ncommon in the neighbourhood of Mahicá, I always found them to be\r\nstocked with small spiders of the genus Gastracantha, in the usual\r\nhalf-dead state to which the mother wasps reduce the insects which are\r\nto serve as food for their progeny.\r\n\r\n\r\nCells of Trypoxylon aurifrons.\r\n\r\nBesides the Pelopæus, there were three or four kinds of Trypoxylon, a\r\ngenus also found in Europe, and which some naturalists have supposed to\r\nbe parasitic, because the legs are not furnished with the usual row of\r\nstrong bristles for digging, characteristic of the family to which it\r\nbelongs. The species of Trypoxylon, however, are all building wasps;\r\ntwo of them which I observed (T. albitarse and an undescribed species)\r\nprovision their nests with spiders, a third (T. aurifrons) with small\r\ncaterpillars. Their habits are similar to those of the Pelopæus;\r\nnamely, they carry off the clay in their mandibles, and have a\r\ndifferent song when they hasten away with the burden to that which they\r\nsing whilst at work. Trypoxylon albitarse, which is a large black kind,\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in length, makes a tremendous fuss whilst\r\nbuilding its cell. It often chooses the walls or doors of chambers for\r\nthis purpose, and when two or three are at work in the same place,\r\ntheir loud humming keeps the house in an uproar. The cell is a tubular\r\nstructure about three inches in length. T. aurifrons, a much smaller\r\nspecies, makes a neat little nest shaped like a carafe, building rows\r\nof them together in the corners of verandahs.\r\n\r\nBut the most numerous and interesting of the clay artificers are the\r\nworkers of a species of social bee, the Melipona fasciculata. The\r\nMeliponæ in tropical America take the place of the true Apides, to\r\nwhich the European hive-bee belongs, and which are here unknown; they\r\nare generally much smaller insects than the hive-bees and have no\r\nsting. The M. fasciculata is about a third shorter than the Apis\r\nmellifica: its colonies are composed of an immense number of\r\nindividuals; the workers are generally seen collecting pollen in the\r\nsame way as other bees, but great numbers are employed gathering clay.\r\nThe rapidity and precision of their movements whilst thus engaged are\r\nwonderful. They first scrape the clay with their jaws; the small\r\nportions gathered are then cleared by the anterior paws and passed to\r\nthe second pair of feet, which, in their turn, convey them to the large\r\nfoliated expansions of the hind shanks which are adapted normally in\r\nbees, as every one knows, for the collection of pollen. The middle feet\r\npat the growing pellets of mortar on the hind legs to keep them in a\r\ncompact shape as the particles are successively added. The little\r\nhodsmen soon have as much as they can carry, and they then fly off. I\r\nwas for some time puzzled to know what the bees did with the clay; but\r\nI had afterwards plenty of opportunity for ascertaining. They construct\r\ntheir combs in any suitable crevice in trunks of trees or perpendicular\r\nbanks, and the clay is required to build up a wall so as to close the\r\ngap, with the exception of a small orifice for their own entrance and\r\nexit. Most kinds of Meliponæ are in this way masons as well as workers\r\nin wax, and pollen-gatherers. One little species (undescribed) not more\r\nthan two lines long, builds a neat tubular gallery of clay, kneaded\r\nwith some viscid substance, outside the entrance to its hive, besides\r\nblocking up the crevice in the tree within which it is situated. The\r\nmouth of the tube is trumpet-shaped, and at the entrance a number of\r\npigmy bees are always stationed, apparently acting as the sentinels.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelipona Bees gathering clay.\r\n\r\nA hive of the Melipona fasciculata, which I saw opened, contained about\r\ntwo quarts of pleasant-tasting liquid honey. The bees, as already\r\nremarked, have no sting, but they bite furiously when their colonies\r\nare disturbed. The Indian who plundered the hive was completely covered\r\nby them; they took a particular fancy to the hair of his head, and\r\nfastened on it by hundreds. I found forty-five species of these bees in\r\ndifferent parts of the country; the largest was half an inch in length;\r\nthe smallest were extremely minute, some kinds being not more than\r\none-twelfth of an inch in size. These tiny fellows are often very\r\ntroublesome in the woods, on account of their familiarity, for they\r\nsettle on one’s face and hands, and, in crawling about, get into the\r\neyes and mouth, or up the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe broad expansion of the hind shanks of bees is applied in some\r\nspecies to other uses besides the conveyance of clay and pollen. The\r\nfemale of the handsome golden and black Euglossa Surinamensis has this\r\npalette of very large size. This species builds its solitary nest also\r\nin crevices of walls or trees; but it closes up the chink with\r\nfragments of dried leaves and sticks cemented together, instead of\r\nclay. It visits the caju trees, and gathers with its hind legs a small\r\nquantity of the gum which exudes from their trunks. To this it adds the\r\nother materials required from the neighbouring bushes, and when laden\r\nflies off to its nest.\r\n\r\nTo the south my rambles never extended further than the banks of the\r\nIrurá, a stream which rises amongst the hills already spoken of, and\r\nrunning through a broad valley, wooded along the margins of the\r\nwater-courses, falls into the Tapajos, at the head of the bay of\r\nMapirí. All beyond, as before remarked, is terra incognita to the\r\ninhabitants of Santarem. The Brazilian settlers on the banks of the\r\nAmazons seem to have no taste for explorations by land, and I could\r\nfind no person willing to accompany me on an excursion further towards\r\nthe interior. Such a journey would be exceedingly difficult in this\r\ncountry, even if men could be obtained willing to undertake it.\r\nBesides, there were reports of a settlement of fierce runaway negroes\r\non the Serra de Mururarú, and it was considered unsafe to go far in\r\nthat direction, except with a large armed party.\r\n\r\nI visited the banks of the Irurá and the rich woods accompanying it,\r\nand two other streams in the same neighbourhood, one called the Panéma,\r\nand the other the Urumarí, once or twice a week during the whole time\r\nof my residence in Santarem, and made large collections of their\r\nnatural productions. These forest brooks, with their clear, cold waters\r\nbrawling over their sandy or pebbly beds through wild tropical glens,\r\nalways had a great charm for me. The beauty of the moist, cool, and\r\nluxuriant glades was heightened by the contrast they afforded to the\r\nsterile country around them. The bare or scantily wooded hills which\r\nsurround the valley are parched by the rays of the vertical sun. One of\r\nthem, the Pico do Irura, forms a nearly perfect cone, rising from a\r\nsmall grassy plain to a height of 500 or 600 feet, and its ascent is\r\nexcessively fatiguing after the long walk from Santarem over the\r\ncampos. I tried it one day, but did not reach the summit. A dense\r\ngrowth of coarse grasses clothed the steep sides of the hill, with here\r\nand there a stunted tree of kinds found in the plain beneath. In bared\r\nplaces, a red crumbly soil is exposed; and in one part a mass of rock,\r\nwhich appeared to me, from its compact texture and the absence of\r\nstratification, to be porphyritic; but I am not geologically sufficient\r\nto pronounce on such questions. Mr. Wallace states that he found\r\nfragments of scoriæ, and believes the hill to be a volcanic cone. To\r\nthe south and east of this isolated peak, the elongated ridges or\r\ntable-topped hills attain a somewhat greater elevation.\r\n\r\nThe forest in the valley is limited to a tract a few hundred yards in\r\nwidth on each side the different streams; in places where these run\r\nalong the bases of the hills, the hill-sides facing the water are also\r\nrichly wooded, although their opposite declivities are bare or nearly\r\nso. The trees are lofty and of great variety; amongst them are colossal\r\nexamples of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), and the Pikiá.\r\nThis latter bears a large eatable fruit, curious in having a hollow\r\nchamber between the pulp and the kernel, beset with hard spines which\r\nproduce serious wounds if they enter the skin. The eatable part\r\nappeared to me not much more palatable than a raw potato; but the\r\ninhabitants of Santarem are very fond of it, and undertake the most\r\ntoilsome journeys on foot to gather a basketful. The tree which yields\r\nthe tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata), used in Europe for scenting snuff,\r\nis also of frequent occurrence here. It grows to an immense height, and\r\nthe fruit, which, although a legume, is of a rounded shape, and has but\r\none seed, can be gathered only when it falls to the ground. A\r\nconsiderable quantity (from 1000 to 3000 pounds) is exported annually\r\nfrom Santarem, the produce of the whole region of the Tapajos. An\r\nendless diversity of trees and shrubs, some beautiful in flower and\r\nfoliage, others bearing curious fruits, grow in this matted wilderness.\r\nIt would be tedious to enumerate many of them. I was much struck with\r\nthe variety of trees with large and diversely-shaped fruits growing out\r\nof the trunk and branches, some within a few inches of the ground, like\r\nthe cacao. Most of them are called by the natives Cupú, and the trees\r\nare of inconsiderable height. One of them called Cupú-aï bears a fruit\r\nof elliptical shape and of a dingy earthen colour six or seven inches\r\nlong, the shell of which is woody and thin, and contains a small number\r\nof seeds loosely enveloped in a juicy pulp of very pleasant flavour.\r\nThe fruits hang like clayey ants’-nests from the branches. Another kind\r\nmore nearly resembles the cacao; this is shaped something like the\r\ncucumber, and has a green ribbed husk. It bears the name of Cacao de\r\nmacaco, or monkey’s chocolate, but the seeds are smaller than those of\r\nthe common cacao. I tried once or twice to make chocolate from them.\r\nThey contain plenty of oil of similar fragrance to that of the ordinary\r\ncacao-nut, and make up very well into paste; but the beverage has a\r\nrepulsive clayey colour and an inferior flavour.\r\n\r\nMy excursions to the Irurá had always a picnic character. A few rude\r\nhuts are scattered through the valley, but they are tenanted only for a\r\nfew days in the year, when their owners come to gather and roast the\r\nmandioca of their small clearings. We used generally to take with us\r\ntwo boys—one negro, the other Indian—to carry our provisions for the\r\nday; a few pounds of beef or dried fish, farinha and bananas, with\r\nplates, and a kettle for cooking. José carried the guns, ammunition and\r\ngame-bags, and I the apparatus for entomologising—the insect net, a\r\nlarge leathern bag with compartments for corked boxes, phials, glass\r\ntubes, and so forth. It was our custom to start soon after sunrise,\r\nwhen the walk over the campos was cool and pleasant, the sky without a\r\ncloud, and the grass wet with dew. The paths are mere faint tracks; in\r\nour early excursions it was difficult to avoid missing our way. We were\r\nonce completely lost, and wandered about for several hours over the\r\nscorching soil without recovering the road. A fine view is obtained of\r\nthe country from the rising ground about half way across the waste.\r\nThence to the bottom of the valley is a long, gentle, grassy slope,\r\nbare of trees. The strangely-shaped hills; the forest at their feet,\r\nrichly varied with palms; the bay of Mapirí on the right, with the dark\r\nwaters of the Tapajos and its white glistening shores, are all spread\r\nout before one, as if depicted on canvas. The extreme transparency of\r\nthe atmosphere gives to all parts of the landscape such clearness of\r\noutline that the idea of distance is destroyed, and one fancies the\r\nwhole to be almost within reach of the hand. Descending into the\r\nvalley, a small brook has to be crossed, and then half a mile of sandy\r\nplain, whose vegetation wears a peculiar aspect, owing to the\r\npredominance of a stemless palm, the Curuá (Attalea spectabilis), whose\r\nlarge, beautifully pinnated, rigid leaves rise directly from the soil.\r\nThe fruit of this species is similar to the coco-nut, containing milk\r\nin the interior of the kernel, but it is much inferior to it in size.\r\nHere, and indeed all along the road, we saw, on most days in the wet\r\nseason, tracks of the jaguar. We never, however, met with the animal,\r\nalthough we sometimes heard his loud “hough” in the night whilst lying\r\nin our hammocks at home, in Santarem, and knew he must he lurking\r\nsomewhere near us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jacuaru (Teius teguexim).\r\n\r\nMy best hunting ground was a part of the valley sheltered on one side\r\nby a steep hill whose declivity, like the swampy valley beneath, was\r\nclothed with magnificent forest. We used to make our halt in a small\r\ncleared place, tolerably free from ants and close to the water. Here we\r\nassembled after our toilsome morning’s hunt in different directions\r\nthrough the woods, took our well-earned meal on the ground—two broad\r\nleaves of the wild banana serving us for a tablecloth—and rested for a\r\ncouple of hours during the great heat of the afternoon. The diversity\r\nof animal productions was as wonderful as that of the vegetable forms\r\nin this rich locality. It was pleasant to lie down during the hottest\r\npart of the day, when my people lay asleep, and watch the movements of\r\nanimals. Sometimes a troop of Anús (Crotophaga), a glossy\r\nblack-plumaged bird, which lives in small societies in grassy places,\r\nwould come in from the campos, one by one, calling to each other as\r\nthey moved from tree to tree. Or a Toucan (Rhamphastos ariel) silently\r\nhopped or ran along and up the branches, peeping into chinks and\r\ncrevices. Notes of solitary birds resounded from a distance through the\r\nwilderness. Occasionally a sulky Trogon would be seen, with its\r\nbrilliant green back and rose-coloured breast, perched for an hour\r\nwithout moving on a low branch. A number of large, fat lizards two feet\r\nlong, of a kind called by the natives Jacuarú (Teius teguexim) were\r\nalways observed in the still hours of midday scampering with great\r\nclatter over the dead leaves, apparently in chase of each other. The\r\nfat of this bulky lizard is much prized by the natives, who apply it as\r\na poultice to draw palm spines or even grains of shot from the flesh.\r\nOther lizards of repulsive aspect, about three feet in length when full\r\ngrown, splashed about and swam in the water, sometimes emerging to\r\ncrawl into hollow trees on the banks of the stream, where I once found\r\na female and a nest of eggs. The lazy flapping flight of large blue and\r\nblack morpho butterflies high in the air, the hum of insects, and many\r\ninanimate sounds, contributed their share to the total impression this\r\nstrange solitude produced. Heavy fruits from the crowns of trees which\r\nwere mingled together at a giddy height overhead, fell now and then\r\nwith a startling “plop” into the water. The breeze, not felt below,\r\nstirred in the topmost branches, setting the twisted and looped sipós\r\nin motion, which creaked and groaned in a great variety of notes. To\r\nthese noises were added the monotonous ripple of the brook, which had\r\nits little cascade at every score or two yards of its course.\r\n\r\nWe frequently fell in with an old Indian woman, named Cecilia, who had\r\na small clearing in the woods. She had the reputation of being a witch\r\n(feiticeira), and I found, on talking with her, that she prided herself\r\non her knowledge of the black art. Her slightly curled hair showed that\r\nshe was not a pure-blood Indian: I was told her father was a dark\r\nmulatto. She was always very civil to our party, showing us the best\r\npaths, explaining the virtues and uses of different plants, and so\r\nforth. I was much amused at the accounts she gave of the place. Her\r\nsolitary life and the gloom of the woods seemed to have filled her with\r\nsuperstitious fancies. She said gold was contained in the bed of the\r\nbrook, and that the murmur of the water over the little cascades was\r\nthe voice of the “water-mother” revealing the hidden treasure. A narrow\r\npass between two hillsides was the portao or gate, and all within,\r\nalong the wooded banks of the stream, was enchanted ground. The hill\r\nunderneath which we were encamped was the enchanter’s abode, and she\r\ngravely told us she often had long conversations with him. These myths\r\nwere of her own invention, and in the same way an endless number of\r\nother similar ones have originated in the childish imaginations of the\r\npoor Indian and half-breed inhabitants of different parts of the\r\ncountry. It is to be remarked, however, that the Indian men all become\r\nsceptics after a little intercourse with the whites. The witchcraft of\r\npoor Cecilia was of a very weak quality. It consisted of throwing\r\npinches of powdered bark of a certain tree, and other substances, into\r\nthe fire whilst muttering a spell—a prayer repeated backwards—and\r\nadding the name of the person on whom she wished the incantation to\r\noperate. Some of the feiticeiras, however, play more dangerous tricks\r\nthan this harmless mummery. They are acquainted with many poisonous\r\nplants, and although they seldom have the courage to administer a fatal\r\ndose, sometimes contrive to convey to their victim sufficient to cause\r\nserious illness. The motive by which they are actuated is usually\r\njealousy of other women in love matters. Whilst I resided in Santarem,\r\na case of what was called witchcraft was tried by the sub-delegado, in\r\nwhich a highly respectable white lady was the complainant. It appeared\r\nthat some feiticeira had sprinkled a quantity of the acrid juice of a\r\nlarge arum on her linen as it was hanging out to dry, and it was\r\nthought this had caused a serious eruption under which the lady\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nI seldom met with any of the larger animals in these excursions. We\r\nnever saw a mammal of any kind on the campos; but tracks of three\r\nspecies were seen occasionally besides those of the jaguar; these\r\nbelonged to a small tiger cat, a deer, and an opossum, all of which\r\nanimals must have been very rare, and probably nocturnal in their\r\nhabits, with the exception of the deer. I saw in the woods, on one\r\noccasion, a small flock of monkeys, and once had an opportunity of\r\nwatching the movements of a sloth. The latter was of the kind called by\r\nCuvier Bradypus tridactylus, which is clothed with shaggy grey hair.\r\nThe natives call it, in the Tupí language, Aï ybyreté (in Portuguese,\r\nPreguiça da terra firme), or sloth of the mainland, to distinguish it\r\nfrom the Bradypus infuscatus, which has a long, black and tawny stripe\r\nbetween the shoulders, and is called Aï Ygapó (Preguiça das vargens),\r\nor sloth of the flooded lands. Some travellers in South America have\r\ndescribed the sloth as very nimble in its native woods, and have\r\ndisputed the justness of the name which has been bestowed upon it. The\r\ninhabitants of the Amazons region, however, both Indians and\r\ndescendants of the Portuguese, hold to the common opinion, and consider\r\nthe sloth as the type of laziness. It is very common for one native to\r\ncall another, in reproaching him for idleness, “bicho do Embaüba”\r\n(beast of the Cecropia tree); the leaves of the Cecropia being the food\r\nof the sloth. It is a strange sight to watch the uncouth creature, fit\r\nproduction of these silent shades, lazily moving from branch to branch.\r\nEvery movement betrays, not indolence exactly, but extreme caution. He\r\nnever looses his hold from one branch without first securing himself to\r\nthe next, and when he does not immediately find a bough to grasp with\r\nthe rigid hooks into which his paws are so curiously transformed, he\r\nraises his body, supported on his hind legs, and claws around in search\r\nof a fresh foothold. After watching the animal for about half an hour I\r\ngave him a charge of shot. He fell with a terrific crash, but caught a\r\nbough, in his descent, with his powerful claws, and remained suspended.\r\nOur Indian lad tried to climb the tree, but was driven back by swarms\r\nof stinging ants; the poor little fellow slid down in a sad\r\npredicament, and plunged into the brook to free himself. Two days\r\nafterwards I found the body of the sloth on the ground, the animal\r\nhaving dropped on the relaxation of the muscles a few hours after\r\ndeath. In one of our voyages, Mr. Wallace and I saw a sloth (B.\r\ninfuscatus) swimming across a river, at a place where it was probably\r\n300 yards broad. I believe it is not generally known that this animal\r\ntakes to the water. Our men caught the beast, cooked, and ate him.\r\n\r\nIn returning from these trips we were sometimes benighted on the\r\ncampos. We did not care for this on moonlit nights, when there was no\r\ndanger of losing the path. The great heat felt in the middle hours of\r\nthe day is much mitigated by four o’clock in the afternoon; a few birds\r\nthen make their appearance; small flocks of ground doves run about the\r\nstony hillocks parrots pass over and sometimes settle in the ilhas;\r\npretty little finches of several species, especially one kind, streaked\r\nwith olive-brown and yellow, and somewhat resembling our yellow-hammer,\r\nbut I believe not belonging to the same genus, hop about the grass,\r\nenlivening the place with a few musical notes. The Carashué (Mimus)\r\nalso then resumes its mellow, blackbird-like song; and two or three\r\nspecies of humming-bird, none of which, however, are peculiar to the\r\ndistrict, flit about from tree to tree. On the other hand, the little\r\nblue and yellow-striped lizards, which abound amongst the herbage\r\nduring the scorching heats of midday, retreat towards this hour to\r\ntheir hiding-places, together with the day-flying insects and the\r\nnumerous campo butterflies. Some of these latter resemble greatly our\r\nEnglish species found in heathy places, namely, a fritillary, Argynnis\r\n(Euptoieta) Hegesia, and two smaller kinds, which are deceptively like\r\nthe little Nemeobius Lucina. After sunset, the air becomes delightfully\r\ncool and fragrant with the aroma of fruits and flowers. The nocturnal\r\nanimals then come forth. A monstrous hairy spider, five inches in\r\nexpanse, of a brown colour with yellowish lines along its stout\r\nlegs—which is very common here, inhabiting broad tubular galleries\r\nsmoothly lined with silken web—may be then caught on the watch at the\r\nmouth of its burrow. It is only seen at night, and I think does not\r\nwander far from its den; the gallery is about two inches in diameter\r\nand runs in a slanting direction, about two feet from the surface of\r\nthe soil. As soon as it is night, swarms of goat-suckers suddenly make\r\ntheir appearance, wheeling about in a noiseless, ghostly manner, in\r\nchase of night-flying insects. They sometimes descend and settle on a\r\nlow branch, or even on the pathway close to where one is walking, and\r\nthen squatting down on their heels, are difficult to distinguish from\r\nthe surrounding soil. One kind has a long forked tail. In the daytime\r\nthey are concealed in the wooded ilhas, where I very often saw them\r\ncrouched and sleeping on the ground in the dense shade. They make no\r\nnest, but lay their eggs on the bare ground. Their breeding time is in\r\nthe rainy season, and fresh eggs are found from December to June. Later\r\nin the evening, the singular notes of the goat-suckers are heard, one\r\nspecies crying Quao, Quao, another Chuck-cococao; and these are\r\nrepeated at intervals far into the night in the most monotonous manner.\r\nA great number of toads are seen on the bare sandy pathways soon after\r\nsunset. One of them was quite a colossus, about seven inches in length\r\nand three in height. This big fellow would never move out of the way\r\nuntil we were close to him. If we jerked him out of the path with a\r\nstick, he would slowly recover himself, and then turn round to have a\r\ngood impudent stare. I have counted as many as thirty of these monsters\r\nwithin a distance of half a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\nVOYAGE UP THE TAPAJOS\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparations for Voyage — First Day’s Sail — Loss of Boat — Altar de\r\nChao — Modes of Obtaining Fish — Difficulties with Crew — Arrival at\r\nAveyros — Excursions in the Neighbourhood — White Cebus, and Habits and\r\nDispositions of Cebi Monkeys — Tame Parrot — Missionary Settlement —\r\nEntering the River Cuparí — Adventure with Anaconda — Smoke-dried\r\nMonkey — Boa-constrictor — Village of Mundurucú Indians, and Incursion\r\nof a Wild Tribe — Falls of the Cuparí — Hyacinthine Macaw — Re-emerge\r\ninto the broad Tapajos — Descent of River to Santarem.\r\n\r\n_June, 1852._—I will now proceed to relate the incidents of my\r\nprincipal excursion up the Tapajos, which I began to prepare for, after\r\nresiding about six months at Santarem.\r\n\r\nI was obliged, this time, to travel in a vessel of my own; partly\r\nbecause trading canoes large enough to accommodate a Naturalist very\r\nseldom pass between Santarem and the thinly-peopled settlements on the\r\nriver, and partly because I wished to explore districts at my ease, far\r\nout of the ordinary track of traders. I soon found a suitable canoe; a\r\ntwo-masted cuberta, of about six tons’ burthen, strongly built of\r\nItauba or stonewood, a timber of which all the best vessels in the\r\nAmazons country are constructed, and said to be more durable than teak.\r\nThis I hired of a merchant at the cheap rate of 500 reis, or about one\r\nshilling and twopence per day. I fitted up the cabin, which, as usual\r\nin canoes of this class, was a square structure with its floor above\r\nthe waterline, as my sleeping and working apartment. My chests, filled\r\nwith store-boxes and trays for specimens, were arranged on each side,\r\nand above them were shelves and pegs to hold my little stock of useful\r\nbooks, guns, and game bags, boards and materials for skinning and\r\npreserving animals, botanical press and papers, drying cages for\r\ninsects. and birds and so forth. A rush mat was spread on the floor,\r\nand my rolled-up hammock, to be used only when sleeping ashore, served\r\nfor a pillow. The arched covering over the hold in the fore part of the\r\nvessel contained, besides a sleeping place for the crew, my heavy\r\nchests, stock of salt provisions and groceries, and an assortment of\r\ngoods wherewith to pay my way amongst the half-civilised or savage\r\ninhabitants of the interior. The goods consisted of cashaca, powder and\r\nshot, a few pieces of coarse, checked cotton cloth and prints,\r\nfish-hooks, axes, large knives, harpoons, arrowheads, looking-glasses,\r\nbeads, and other small wares. José and myself were busy for many days\r\narranging these matters. We had to salt the meat and grind a supply of\r\ncoffee ourselves. Cooking utensils, crockery, water-jars, a set of\r\nuseful carpenter’s tools, and many other things had to be provided. We\r\nput all the groceries and other perishable articles in tin canisters\r\nand boxes, having found that this was the only way of preserving them\r\nfrom dampness and insects in this climate. When all was done, our canoe\r\nlooked like a little floating workshop.\r\n\r\nI could get little information about the river, except vague accounts\r\nof the difficulty of the navigation, and the famito or hunger which\r\nreigned on its banks. As I have before mentioned, it is about 1000\r\nmiles in length, and flows from south to north; in magnitude it stands\r\nthe sixth amongst the tributaries of the Amazons. It is navigable,\r\nhowever, by sailing vessels only for about 160 miles above Santarem.\r\nThe hiring of men to navigate the vessel was our greatest trouble. José\r\nwas to be my helmsman, and we thought three other hands would be the\r\nfewest with which we could venture. But all our endeavours to procure\r\nthese were fruitless. Santarem is worse provided with Indian canoemen\r\nthan any other town on the river. I found on applying to the tradesmen\r\nto whom I had brought letters of introduction and to the Brazilian\r\nauthorities, that almost any favour would be sooner granted than the\r\nloan of hands. A stranger, however, is obliged to depend on them; for\r\nit is impossible to find an Indian or half-caste whom someone or other\r\nof the head-men do not claim as owing him money or labour. I was afraid\r\nat one time I should have been forced to abandon my project on this\r\naccount. At length, after many rebuffs and disappointments, José\r\ncontrived to engage one man, a mulatto, named Pinto, a native of the\r\nmining country of Interior Brazil, who knew the river well; and with\r\nthese two I resolved to start, hoping to meet with others at the first\r\nvillage on the road.\r\n\r\nWe left Santarem on the 8th of June. The waters were then at their\r\nhighest point, and my canoe had been anchored close to the back door of\r\nour house. The morning was cool and a brisk wind blew, with which we\r\nsped rapidly past the white-washed houses and thatched Indian huts of\r\nthe suburbs. The charming little bay of Mapirí was soon left behind; we\r\nthen doubled Point Maria Josepha, a headland formed of high cliffs of\r\nTabatinga clay, capped with forest. This forms the limit of the river\r\nview from Santarem, and here we had our last glimpse, at a distance of\r\nseven or eight miles, of the city, a bright line of tiny white\r\nbuildings resting on the dark water. A stretch of wild, rocky,\r\nuninhabited coast was before us, and we were fairly within the Tapajos.\r\n\r\nOur course lay due west for about twenty miles. The wind increased as\r\nwe neared Point Cururú, where the river bends from its northern course.\r\nA vast expanse of water here stretches to the west and south, and the\r\nwaves, with a strong breeze, run very high. As we were doubling the\r\nPoint, the cable which held our montaria in tow astern, parted, and in\r\nendeavouring to recover the boat, without which we knew it would be\r\ndifficult to get ashore on many parts of the coast, we were very near\r\ncapsizing. We tried to tack down the river; a vain attempt with a\r\nstrong breeze and no current. Our ropes snapped, the sails flew to\r\nrags, and the vessel, which we now found was deficient in ballast,\r\nheeled over frightfully. Contrary to José’s advice, I ran the cuberta\r\ninto a little bay, thinking to cast anchor there and wait for the boat\r\ncoming up with the wind; but the anchor dragged on the smooth sandy\r\nbottom, and the vessel went broadside on to the rocky beach. With a\r\nlittle dexterous management, but not until after we had sustained some\r\nsevere bumps, we managed to get out of this difficulty, clearing the\r\nrocky point at a close shave with our jib-sail. Soon after, we drifted\r\ninto the smooth water of a sheltered bay which leads to the charmingly\r\nsituated village of Altar do Chao; and we were obliged to give up our\r\nattempt to recover the montaria.\r\n\r\nThe little settlement, Altar de Chao (altar of the ground, or Earth\r\naltar), owes its singular name to the existence at the entrance to the\r\nharbour of one of those strange flat-topped hills which are so common\r\nin this part of the Amazons country, shaped like the high altar in\r\nRoman Catholic churches. It is an isolated one, and much lower in\r\nheight than the similarly truncated hills and ridges near Almeyrim,\r\nbeing elevated probably not more than 300 feet above the level of the\r\nriver. It is bare of trees, but covered in places with a species of\r\nfern. At the head of the bay is an inner harbour, which communicates by\r\na channel with a series of lakes lying in the valleys between hills,\r\nand stretching far into the interior of the land. The village is\r\npeopled almost entirely by semi-civilised Indians, to the number of\r\nsixty or seventy families; and the scattered houses are arranged in\r\nbroad streets on a strip of greensward, at the foot of a high,\r\ngloriously-wooded ridge.\r\n\r\nI was so much pleased with the situation of this settlement, and the\r\nnumber of rare birds and insects which tenanted the forest, that I\r\nrevisited it in the following year, and spent four months making\r\ncollections. The village itself is a neglected, poverty- stricken\r\nplace: the governor (Captain of Trabalhadores, or Indian workmen) being\r\nan old, apathetic, half-breed, who had spent all his life here. The\r\npriest was a most profligate character; I seldom saw him sober; he was\r\na white, however, and a man of good ability. I may as well mention\r\nhere, that a moral and zealous priest is a great rarity in this\r\nprovince: the only ministers of religion in the whole country who\r\nappeared sincere in their calling being the Bishop of Para and the\r\nVicars of Ega on the Upper Amazons and Obydos. The houses in the\r\nvillage swarmed with vermin; bats in the thatch, fire-ants (formiga de\r\nfogo) under the floors; cockroaches and spiders on the walls. Very few\r\nof them had wooden doors and locks. Altar de Chao was originally a\r\nsettlement of the aborigines, and was called Burarí. The Indians were\r\nalways hostile to the Portuguese, and during the disorders of 1835-6\r\njoined the rebels in their attack on Santarem. Few of them escaped the\r\nsubsequent slaughter, and for this reason there is now scarcely an old\r\nor middle-aged man in the place. As in all the semi-civilised villages,\r\nwhere the original orderly and industrious habits of the Indian have\r\nbeen lost without anything being learned from the whites to make\r\namends, the inhabitants live in the greatest poverty. The scarcity of\r\nfish in the clear waters and rocky bays of the neighbourhood is no\r\ndoubt partly the cause of the poverty and perennial hunger which reign\r\nhere. When we arrived in the port, our canoe was crowded with the\r\nhalf-naked villagers—men, women, and children, who came to beg each a\r\npiece of salt pirarucu “for the love of God.” They are not quite so\r\nbadly off in the dry season. The shallow lakes and bays then contain\r\nplenty of fish, and the boys and women go out at night to spear them by\r\ntorchlight; the torches being made of thin strips of green bark from\r\nthe leaf-stalks of palms, tied in bundles. Many excellent kinds of fish\r\nare thus obtained; amongst them the Pescada, whose white and flaky\r\nflesh, when boiled, has the appearance and flavour of cod-fish; and the\r\nTucunaré (Cichla temensis), a handsome species, with a large\r\nprettily-coloured, eye-like spot on its tail. Many small Salmonidæ are\r\nalso met with, and a kind of sole, called Aramassá, which moves along\r\nthe clear sandy bottom of the bay. At these times a species of\r\nsting-ray is common on the sloping beach, and bathers are frequently\r\nstung most severely by it. The weapon of this fish is a strong blade\r\nwith jagged edges, about three inches long, growing from the side of\r\nthe long fleshy tail. I once saw a woman wounded by it whilst bathing;\r\nshe shrieked frightfully, and was obliged to be carried to her hammock,\r\nwhere she lay for a week in great pain; I have known strong men to be\r\nlamed for many months by the sting.\r\n\r\nThere was a mode of taking fish here which I had not before seen\r\nemployed, but found afterwards to be very common on the Tapajos. This\r\nis by using a poisonous liana called Timbó (Paullinia pinnata). It will\r\nact only in the still waters of creeks and pools. A few rods, a yard in\r\nlength, are mashed and soaked in the water, which quickly becomes\r\ndiscoloured with the milky deleterious juice of the plant. In about\r\nhalf an hour all the smaller fishes over a rather wide space around the\r\nspot, rise to the surface floating on their sides, and with the gills\r\nwide open. The poison acts evidently by suffocating the fishes; it\r\nspreads slowly in the water, and a very slight mixture seems sufficient\r\nto stupefy them. I was surprised, upon beating the water in places\r\nwhere no fishes were visible in the clear depths for many yards round,\r\nto find, sooner or later, sometimes twenty-four hours afterwards, a\r\nconsiderable number floating dead on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe people occupy themselves the greater part of the year with their\r\nsmall plantations of mandioca. All the heavy work, such as felling and\r\nburning the timber, planting and weeding, is done in the plantation of\r\neach family by a congregation of neighbours, which they call a\r\n“pucherum:”—a similar custom to the “bee” in the backwood settlements\r\nof North America. They make quite a holiday of each pucherum. When the\r\ninvitation is issued, the family prepares a great quantity of fermented\r\ndrink, called in this part Tarobá, made from soaked mandioca cakes, and\r\nporridge of Manicueira. This latter is a kind of sweet mandioca, very\r\ndifferent from the Yuca of the Peruvians and Macasheira of the\r\nBrazilians (Manihot Aypi), having oblong juicy roots, which become very\r\nsweet a few days after they are gathered. With these simple provisions\r\nthey regale their helpers. The work is certainly done, but after a very\r\nrude fashion; all become soddened with Tarobá, and the day finishes\r\noften in a drunken brawl.\r\n\r\nThe climate is rather more humid than that of Santarem. I suppose this\r\nis to be attributed to the neighbouring country being densely wooded\r\ninstead of an open campo. In no part of the country did I enjoy more\r\nthe moonlit nights than here, in the dry season. After the day’s work\r\nwas done, I used to go down to the shores of the bay, and lie at full\r\nlength on the cool sand for two or three hours before bedtime. The soft\r\npale light, resting on broad sandy beaches and palm-thatched huts,\r\nreproduced the effect of a mid-winter scene in the cold north when a\r\ncoating of snow lies on the landscape. A heavy shower falls about once\r\na week, and the shrubby vegetation never becomes parched as at\r\nSantarem. Between the rains, the heat and dryness increase from day to\r\nday: the weather on the first day after the rain is gleamy, with\r\nintervals of melting sunshine and passing clouds; the next day is\r\nrather drier, and the east wind begins to blow; then follow days of\r\ncloudless sky, with gradually increasing strength of breeze. When this\r\nhas continued about a week, a light mistiness begins to gather about\r\nthe horizon; clouds are formed; grumbling thunder is heard; and then,\r\ngenerally in the night-time, down falls the refreshing rain. The sudden\r\nchill caused by the rains produces colds, which are accompanied by the\r\nsame symptoms as in our own climate; with this exception, the place is\r\nvery healthy.\r\n\r\n_June 17th._—The two young men returned without meeting with my\r\nmontaria, and I found it impossible here to buy a new one. Captain\r\nThomás could find me only one hand. This was a blunt- spoken but\r\nwilling young Indian, named Manoel. He came on board this morning at\r\neight o’clock, and we then got up our anchor and resumed our voyage.\r\n\r\nThe wind was light and variable all day, and we made only about fifteen\r\nmiles by seven o’clock in the evening. The coast formed a succession of\r\nlong, shallow bays with sandy beaches, upon which the waves broke in a\r\nlong line of surf. Ten miles above Altar de Chao is a conspicuous\r\nheadland, called Point Cajetúba. During a lull of the wind, towards\r\nmidday, we ran the cuberta aground in shallow water and waded ashore;\r\nbut the woods were scarcely penetrable, and not a bird was to be seen.\r\nThe only thing observed worthy of note was the quantity of drowned\r\nwinged ants along the beach; they were all of one species, the terrible\r\nformiga de fogo (Myrmica sævissima); the dead, or half-dead bodies of\r\nwhich were heaped up in a line an inch or two in height and breadth,\r\nthe line continuing without interruption for miles at the edge of the\r\nwater. The countless thousands had been doubtless cast into the river\r\nwhilst flying during a sudden squall the night before, and afterwards,\r\ncast ashore by the waves. We found ourselves at seven o’clock near the\r\nmouth of a creek leading to a small lake, called Aramána-í, and the\r\nwind having died away, we anchored, guided by the lights ashore, near\r\nthe house of a settler named Jeronymo, whom I knew, and who, soon\r\nafter, showed us a snug little harbour where we could remain in safety\r\nfor the night. The river here cannot be less than ten miles broad; it\r\nis quite clear of islands and free from shoals at this season of the\r\nyear. The opposite coast appeared in the daytime as a long thin line of\r\nforest, with dim grey hills in the background.\r\n\r\nTo-day (19th) we had a good wind, which carried us to the mouth of a\r\ncreek, culled Paquiatúba, where the “inspector” of the district lived,\r\nSenhor Cypriano, for whom I had brought an order from Captain Thomás to\r\nsupply me with another hand. We had great difficulty in finding a place\r\nto land. The coast in this part was a tract of level, densely-wooded\r\ncountry, through which flowed the winding rivulet, or creek, which\r\ngives its name to a small scattered settlement hidden in the\r\nwilderness; the hills here receding two or three miles towards the\r\ninterior. A large portion of the forest was flooded, the trunks of the\r\nvery high trees near the mouth of the creek standing eighteen feet deep\r\nin water. We lost two hours working our way with poles through the\r\ninundated woods in search of the port. Every inlet we tried ended in a\r\nlabyrinth choked up with bushes, but we were at length guided to the\r\nright place by the crowing of cocks. On shouting for a montaria, an\r\nIndian boy made his appearance, guiding one through the gloomy\r\nthickets; but he was so alarmed, I suppose at the apparition of a\r\nstrange-looking white man in spectacles bawling from the brow of the\r\nvessel, that he shot back quickly into the bushes. He returned when\r\nManoel spoke, and we went ashore: the montaria winding along a gloomy\r\novershadowed water-path made by cutting away the lower branches and\r\nunderwood. The foot-road to the houses was a narrow, sandy alley,\r\nbordered by trees of stupendous height, overrun with creepers, and\r\nhaving an unusual number of long air-roots dangling from the epiphytes\r\non their branches.\r\n\r\nAfter passing one low smoky little hut half-buried in foliage, the path\r\nbranched off in various directions, and the boy having left us, we took\r\nthe wrong turn. We were brought to a stand soon after by the barking of\r\ndogs; and on shouting, as is customary on approaching a dwelling, “O da\r\ncasa!” (Oh of the house!) a dark- skinned native, a Cafuzo, with a most\r\nunpleasant expression of countenance, came forth through the tangled\r\nmaze of bushes, armed with a long knife, with which he pretended to be\r\nwhittling a stick. He directed us to the house of Cypriano, which was\r\nabout a mile distant along another forest road. The circumstance of the\r\nCafuzo coming out armed to receive visitors very much astonished my\r\ncompanions, who talked it over at every place we visited for several\r\ndays afterwards, the freest and most unsuspecting welcome in these\r\nretired places being always counted upon by strangers. But, as Manoel\r\nremarked, the fellow may have been one of the unpardoned rebel leaders\r\nwho had settled here after the recapture of Santarem in 1836, and lived\r\nin fear of being inquired for by the authorities of Santarem. After all\r\nour troubles we found Cypriano absent from home. His house was a large\r\none, and full of people, old and young, women and children, all of whom\r\nwere Indians or mamelucos. Several smaller huts surrounded the large\r\ndwelling, besides extensive open sheds containing mandioca ovens and\r\nrude wooden mills for grinding sugar-cane to make molasses. All the\r\nbuildings were embosomed in trees: it would be scarcely possible to\r\nfind a more retired nook, and an air of contentment was spread over the\r\nwhole establishment. Cypriano’s wife, a good- looking mameluco girl,\r\nwas superintending the packing of farina. Two or three old women,\r\nseated on mats, were making baskets with narrow strips of bark from the\r\nleaf-stalks of palms, whilst others were occupied lining them with the\r\nbroad leaves of a species of maranta, and filling them afterwards with\r\nfarina, which was previously measured in a rude square vessel. It\r\nappeared that Senhor Cypriano was a large producer of the article,\r\nselling 300 baskets (sixty pounds’ weight each) annually to Santarem\r\ntraders. I was sorry we were unable to see him, but it was useless\r\nwaiting, as we were told all the men were at present occupied in\r\n“pucherums,” and he would be unable to give me the assistance I\r\nrequired. We returned to the canoe in the evening, and, after moving\r\nout into the river, anchored and slept.\r\n\r\n_June 20th._—We had a light, baffling wind off shore all day on the\r\n20th, and made but fourteen or fifteen miles by six p.m.; when, the\r\nwind failing us, we anchored at the mouth of a narrow channel, called\r\nTapaiúna, which runs between a large island and the mainland. About\r\nthree o’clock we passed in front of Boim, a village on the opposite\r\n(western) coast. The breadth of the river here is six or seven miles: a\r\nconfused patch of white on the high land opposite was all we saw of the\r\nvillage, the separate houses being undistinguishable on account of the\r\ndistance. The coast along which we sailed today is a continuation of\r\nthe low and flooded land of Paquiatúba.\r\n\r\n_June 21st._—The next morning we sailed along the Tapaiúna channel,\r\nwhich is from 400 to 600 yards in breadth. We advanced but slowly, as\r\nthe wind was generally dead against us, and stopped frequently to\r\nramble ashore. Wherever the landing-place was sandy, it was impossible\r\nto walk about on account of the swarms of the terrible fire-ant, whose\r\nsting is likened by the Brazilians to the puncture of a red-hot needle.\r\nThere was scarcely a square inch of ground free from them. About three\r\np.m. we glided into a quiet, shady creek, on whose banks an industrious\r\nwhite settler had located himself. I resolved to pass the rest of the\r\nday and night here, and endeavour to obtain a fresh supply of\r\nprovisions, our stock of salt beef being now nearly exhausted. The\r\nsituation of the house was beautiful; the little harbour being gay with\r\nwater plants, Pontederiæ, now full of purple blossom, from which flocks\r\nof stilt-legged water-fowl started up screaming as we entered. The\r\nowner sent a boy with my men to show them the best place for fish up\r\nthe creek, and in the course of the evening sold me a number of fowls,\r\nbesides baskets of beans and farina. The result of the fishing was a\r\ngood supply of Jandiá, a handsome spotted Siluride fish, and Piránha, a\r\nkind of Salmon. Piránhas are of several kinds, many of which abound in\r\nthe waters of the Tapajos. They are caught with almost any kind of\r\nbait, for their taste is indiscriminate and their appetite most\r\nravenous. They often attack the legs of bathers near the shore,\r\ninflicting severe wounds with their strong triangular teeth. At\r\nPaquiatúba and this place, I added about twenty species of small fishes\r\nto my collection; caught by hook and line, or with the hand in shallow\r\npools under the shade of the forest.\r\n\r\nMy men slept ashore, and upon the coming aboard in the morning, Pinto\r\nwas drunk and insolent. According to José, who had kept himself sober,\r\nand was alarmed at the other’s violent conduct, the owner of the house\r\nand Pinto had spent the greater part of the night together, drinking\r\naguardente de beijú,—a spirit distilled from the mandioca root. We knew\r\nnothing of the antecedents of this man, who was a tall, strong,\r\nself-willed fellow, and it began to dawn on us that this was not a very\r\nsafe travelling companion in a wild country like this. I thought it\r\nbetter now to make the best of our way to the next settlement, Aveyros,\r\nand get rid of him. Our course to-day lay along a high rocky coast,\r\nwhich extended without a break for about eight miles. The height of the\r\nperpendicular rocks was from 100 to 150 feet; ferns and flowering\r\nshrubs grew in the crevices, and the summit supported a luxuriant\r\ngrowth of forest, like the rest of the river banks. The waves beat with\r\na loud roar at the foot of these inhospitable barriers. At two p.m. we\r\npassed the mouth of a small picturesque harbour, formed by a gap in the\r\nprecipitous coast. Several families have here settled; the place is\r\ncalled Itá-puáma, or “standing rock,” from a remarkable isolated cliff,\r\nwhich stands erect at the entrance to the little haven. A short\r\ndistance beyond Itá-puáma we found ourselves opposite to the village of\r\nPinhel, which is perched, like Boim, on high ground, on the western\r\nside of the river. The stream is here from six to seven miles wide. A\r\nline of low islets extends in front of Pinhel, and a little further to\r\nthe south is a larger island, called Capitarí, which lies nearly in the\r\nmiddle of the river.\r\n\r\n_June 23rd._—The wind freshened at ten o’clock in the morning of the\r\n23rd. A thick black cloud then began to spread itself over the sky a\r\nlong way down the river; the storm which it portended, however, did not\r\nreach us, as the dark threatening mass crossed from east to west, and\r\nthe only effect it had was to impel a column of cold air up river,\r\ncreating a breeze with which we bounded rapidly forward. The wind in\r\nthe afternoon strengthened to a gale; we carried on with one foresail\r\nonly, two of the men holding on to the boom to prevent the whole thing\r\nfrom flying to pieces. The rocky coast continued for about twelve miles\r\nabove Itá-puáma, then succeeded a tract of low marshy land, which had\r\nevidently been once an island whose channel of separation from the\r\nmainland had become silted up. The island of Capitarí and another group\r\nof islets succeeding it, called Jacaré, on the opposite side, helped\r\nalso to contract at this point the breadth of the river, which was now\r\nnot more than about three miles. The little cuberta almost flew along\r\nthis coast, there being no perceptible current, past extensive swamps,\r\nmargined with thick floating grasses. At length, on rounding a low\r\npoint, higher land again appeared on the right bank of the river, and\r\nthe village of Aveyros hove in sight, in the port of which we cast\r\nanchor late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAveyros is a small settlement, containing only fourteen or fifteen\r\nhouses besides the church; but it is the place of residence of the\r\nauthorities of a large district; the priest, Juiz de Paz, the\r\nsubdelegado of police, and the Captain of the Trabalhadores. The\r\ndistrict includes Pinhel, which we passed about twenty miles lower down\r\non the left bank of the river. Five miles beyond Aveyros, and also on\r\nthe left bank, is the missionary village of Santa Cruz, comprising\r\nthirty or forty families of baptised Mundurucú Indians, who are at\r\npresent under the management of a Capuchin Friar, and are independent\r\nof the Captain of Trabalhadores of Aveyros. The river view from this\r\npoint towards the south was very grand; the stream is from two to three\r\nmiles broad, with green islets resting on its surface, and on each side\r\na chain of hills stretches away in long perspective. I resolved to stay\r\nhere for a few weeks to make collections. On landing, my first care was\r\nto obtain a house or room, that I might live ashore. This was soon\r\narranged; the head man of the place, Captain Antonio, having received\r\nnotice of my coming, so that before night all the chests and apparatus\r\nI required were housed and put in order for working.\r\n\r\nI here dismissed Pinto, who again got drunk and quarrelsome a few hours\r\nafter he came ashore. He left the next day, to my great relief, in a\r\nsmall trading canoe that touched at the place on its way to Santarem.\r\nThe Indian Manoel took his leave at the same time, having engaged to\r\naccompany me only as far as Aveyros; I was then dependent on Captain\r\nAntonio for fresh hands. The captains of Trabalhadores are appointed by\r\nthe Brazilian Government to embody the scattered Indian labourers and\r\ncanoe-men of their respective districts, to the end that they may\r\nsupply passing travellers with men when required. A semi-military\r\norganisation is given to the bodies; some of the steadiest amongst the\r\nIndians themselves being nominated as sergeants, and all the members\r\nmustered at the principal village of their district twice a-year. The\r\ncaptains, however, universally abuse their authority, monopolising the\r\nservice of the men for their own purposes, so that it is only by favour\r\nthat the loan of a canoe-hand can be wrung from them. I was treated by\r\nCaptain Antonio with great consideration, and promised two good Indians\r\nwhen I should be ready to continue my voyage.\r\n\r\nLittle happened worth narrating during my forty days’ stay at Aveyros.\r\nThe time was spent in the quiet, regular pursuit of Natural History:\r\nevery morning I had my long ramble in the forest, which extended to the\r\nback-doors of the houses, and the afternoons were occupied in\r\npreserving and studying the objects collected. The priest was a lively\r\nold man, but rather a bore from being able to talk of scarcely anything\r\nexcept homoeopathy, having been smitten with the mania during a recent\r\nvisit to Santarem. He had a Portuguese Homoeopathic Dictionary, and a\r\nlittle leather case containing glass tubes filled with globules, with\r\nwhich he was doctoring the whole village. A bitter enmity seemed to\r\nexist between the female members of the priest’s family, and those of\r\nthe captain’s; the only white women in the settlement. It was amusing\r\nto notice how they flaunted past each other, when going to church on\r\nSundays, in their starched muslin dresses. I found an intelligent young\r\nman living here, a native of the province of Goyaz, who was exploring\r\nthe neighbourhood for gold and diamonds. He had made one journey up a\r\nbranch river, and declared to me that he had found one diamond, but was\r\nunable to continue his researches, because the Indians who accompanied\r\nhim refused to remain any longer; he was now waiting for Captain\r\nAntonio to assist him with fresh men, having offered him in return a\r\nshare in the results of the enterprise. There appeared to be no doubt\r\nthat gold is occasionally found within two or three days’ journey of\r\nAveyros; but all lengthened search is made impossible by the scarcity\r\nof food and the impatience of the Indians, who see no value in the\r\nprecious metal, and abhor the tediousness of the gold-searcher’s\r\noccupation. It is impossible to do without them, as they are required\r\nto paddle the canoes.\r\n\r\nThe weather, during the month of July, was uninterruptedly fine; not a\r\ndrop of rain fell, and the river sank rapidly. The mornings, for two\r\nhours after sunrise, were very cold; we were glad to wrap ourselves in\r\nblankets on turning out of our hammocks, and walk about at a quick pace\r\nin the early sunshine. But in the afternoons, the heat was sickening,\r\nfor the glowing sun then shone full on the front of the row of\r\nwhitewashed houses, and there was seldom any wind to moderate its\r\neffects. I began now to understand why the branch rivers of the Amazons\r\nwere so unhealthy, whilst the main stream was pretty nearly free from\r\ndiseases arising from malaria. The cause lies, without doubt, in the\r\nslack currents of the tributaries in the dry season, and the absence of\r\nthe cooling Amazonian trade-wind, which purifies the air along the\r\nbanks of the main river. The trade-wind does not deviate from its\r\nnearly straight westerly course, so that the branch streams, which run\r\ngenerally at right angles to the Amazons, and, have a slack current for\r\na long distance from their mouths, are left to the horrors of nearly\r\nstagnant air and water.\r\n\r\nAveyros may be called the head-quarters of the fire-ant, which might be\r\nfittingly termed the scourge of this fine river. The Tapajos is nearly\r\nfree from the insect pests of other parts, mosquitoes, sand-flies,\r\nMotúcas and piums; but the formiga de fogo is perhaps a greater plague\r\nthan all the others put together. It is found only on sandy soils in\r\nopen places, and seems to thrive most in the neighbourhood of houses\r\nand weedy villages, such as Aveyros; it does not occur at all in the\r\nshades of the forest. I noticed it in most places on the banks of the\r\nAmazons but the species is not very common on the main river, and its\r\npresence is there scarcely noticed, because it does not attack man, and\r\nthe sting is not so virulent as it is in the same species on the banks\r\nof the Tapajos. Aveyros was deserted a few years before my visit on\r\naccount of this little tormentor, and the inhabitants had only recently\r\nreturned to their houses, thinking its numbers had decreased. It is a\r\nsmall species, of a shining reddish colour not greatly differing from\r\nthe common red stinging ant of our own country (Myrmica rubra), except\r\nthat the pain and irritation caused by its sting are much greater. The\r\nsoil of the whole village is undermined by it; the ground is perforated\r\nwith the entrances to their subterranean galleries, and a little sandy\r\ndome occurs here and there, where the insects bring their young to\r\nreceive warmth near the surface. The houses are overrun with them; they\r\ndispute every fragment of food with the inhabitants, and destroy\r\nclothing for the sake of the starch. All eatables are obliged to be\r\nsuspended in baskets from the rafters, and the cords well soaked with\r\ncopauba balsam, which is the only means known of preventing them from\r\nclimbing. They seem to attack persons out of sheer malice; if we stood\r\nfor a few moments in the street, even at a distance from their nests,\r\nwe were sure to be overrun and severely punished, for the moment an ant\r\ntouched the flesh, he secured himself with his jaws, doubled in his\r\ntail, and stung with all his might. When we were seated on chairs in\r\nthe evenings in front of the house to enjoy a chat with our neighbours,\r\nwe had stools to support our feet, the legs of which, as well as those\r\nof the chairs, were well anointed with the balsam. The cords of\r\nhammocks are obliged to be smeared in the same way to prevent the ants\r\nfrom paying sleepers a visit.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants declare that the fire-ant was unknown on the Tapajos\r\nbefore the disorders of 1835-6, and believe that the hosts sprang up\r\nfrom the blood of the slaughtered Cabanas or rebels. They have\r\ndoubtless increased since that time, but the cause lies in the\r\ndepopulation of the villages and the rank growth of weeds in the\r\npreviously cleared, well-kept spaces. I have already described the line\r\nof sediment formed on the sandy shores lower down the river by the dead\r\nbodies of the winged individuals of this species. The exodus from their\r\nnests of the males and females takes place at the end of the rainy\r\nseason (June), when the swarms are blown into the river by squalls of\r\nwind, and subsequently cast ashore by the waves; I was told that this\r\nwholesale destruction of ant-life takes place annually, and that the\r\nsame compact heap of dead bodies which I saw only in part, extends\r\nalong the banks of the river for twelve or fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe forest behind Aveyros yielded me little except insects, but in\r\nthese it was very rich. It is not too dense, and broad sunny paths\r\nskirted by luxuriant beds of Lycopodiums, which form attractive\r\nsporting places for insects, extend from the village to a swampy hollow\r\nor ygapó, which lies about a mile inland. Of butterflies alone I\r\nenumerated fully 300 species, captured or seen in the course of forty\r\ndays within a half-hour’s walk of the village. This is a greater number\r\nthan is found in the whole of Europe. The only monkey I observed was\r\nthe Callithrix moloch—one of the kinds called by the Indians\r\n“Whaiápu-saí”. It is a moderate-sized species, clothed with long brown\r\nhair, and having hands of a whitish hue. Although nearly allied to the\r\nCebi, it has none of their restless vivacity, but is a dull listless\r\nanimal. It goes in small flocks of five or six individuals, running\r\nalong the main boughs of the trees. One of the specimens which I\r\nobtained here was caught on a low fruit-tree at the back of our house\r\nat sunrise one morning. This was the only instance of a monkey being\r\ncaptured in such a position that I ever heard of. As the tree was\r\nisolated, it must have descended to the ground from the neighbouring\r\nforest and walked some distance to get at it. The species is sometimes\r\nkept in a tame state by the natives: it does not make a very amusing\r\npet, and survives captivity only a short time.\r\n\r\nI heard that the white Cebus, the Caiarára branca, a kind of monkey I\r\nhad not yet seen, and wished very much to obtain, inhabited the forests\r\non the opposite side of the river; so one day, on an opportunity being\r\nafforded by our host going over in a large boat, I crossed to go in\r\nsearch of it. We were about twenty persons in all, and the boat was an\r\nold rickety affair with the gaping seams rudely stuffed with tow and\r\npitch. In addition to the human freight we took three sheep with us,\r\nwhich Captain Antonio had just received from Santarem and was going to\r\nadd to his new cattle farm on the other side. Ten Indian paddlers\r\ncarried us quickly across. The breadth of the river could not be less\r\nthan three miles, and the current was scarcely perceptible. When a boat\r\nhas to cross the main Amazons, it is obliged to ascend along the banks\r\nfor half a mile or more to allow for drifting by the current; in this\r\nlower part of the Tapajos this is not necessary. When about halfway,\r\nthe sheep, in moving about, kicked a hole in the bottom of the boat.\r\nThe passengers took the matter very coolly, although the water spouted\r\nup alarmingly, and I thought we should inevitably be swamped. Captain\r\nAntonio took off his socks to stop the leak, inviting me and the Juiz\r\nde Paz, who was one of the party, to do the same, whilst two Indians\r\nbaled out the water with large cuyas. We thus managed to keep afloat\r\nuntil we reached our destination, when the men patched up the leak for\r\nour return journey.\r\n\r\nThe landing-place lay a short distance within the mouth of a shady\r\ninlet, on whose banks, hidden amongst the dense woods, were the houses\r\nof a few Indian and mameluco settlers. The path to the cattle farm led\r\nfirst through a tract of swampy forest; it then ascended a slope and\r\nemerged on a fine sweep of prairie, varied with patches of timber. The\r\nwooded portion occupied the hollows where the soil was of a rich\r\nchocolate-brown colour, and of a peaty nature. The higher grassy,\r\nundulating parts of the campo had a lighter and more sandy soil.\r\nLeaving our friends, José and I took our guns and dived into the woods\r\nin search of the monkeys. As we walked rapidly along I was very near\r\ntreading on a rattlesnake, which lay stretched out nearly in a straight\r\nline on the bare sandy pathway. It made no movement to get out of the\r\nway, and I escaped the danger by a timely and sudden leap, being unable\r\nto check my steps in the hurried walk. We tried to excite the sluggish\r\nreptile by throwing handsfull of sand and sticks at it, but the only\r\nnotice it took was to raise its ugly horny tail and shake its rattle.\r\nAt length it began to move rather nimbly, when we despatched it by a\r\nblow on the head with a pole, not wishing to fire on account of\r\nalarming our game.\r\n\r\nWe saw nothing of the white Caiarára; we met, however, with a flock of\r\nthe common light-brown allied species (Cebus albifrons?), and killed\r\none as a specimen. A resident on this side of the river told us that\r\nthe white kind was found further to the south, beyond Santa Cruz. The\r\nlight-brown Caiarára is pretty generally distributed over the forests\r\nof the level country. I saw it very frequently on the banks of the\r\nUpper Amazons, where it was always a treat to watch a flock leaping\r\namongst the trees, for it is the most wonderful performer in this line\r\nof the whole tribe. The troops consist of thirty or more individuals,\r\nwhich travel in single file. When the foremost of the flock reaches the\r\noutermost branch of an unusually lofty tree, he springs forth into the\r\nair without a moment’s hesitation and alights on the dome of yielding\r\nfoliage belonging to the neighbouring tree, maybe fifty feet beneath;\r\nall the rest following the example. They grasp, upon falling, with\r\nhands and tail, right themselves in a moment, and then away they go\r\nalong branch and bough to the next tree. The Caiarára owes its name in\r\nthe Tupí language, macaw or large-headed (Acain, head, and Arára\r\nmacaw), to the disproportionate size of the head compared with the rest\r\nof the body. It is very frequently kept as a pet in houses of natives.\r\nI kept one myself for about a year, which accompanied me in my voyages\r\nand became very familiar, coming to me always on wet nights to share my\r\nblanket. It is a most restless creature, but is not playful like most\r\nof the American monkeys; the restlessness of its disposition seeming to\r\narise from great nervous irritability and discontent. The anxious,\r\npainful, and changeable expression of its countenance, and the want of\r\npurpose in its movements, betray this. Its actions are like those of a\r\nwayward child; it does not seem happy even when it has plenty of its\r\nfavourite food, bananas; but will leave its own meal to snatch the\r\nmorsels out of the hands of its companions. It differs in these mental\r\ntraits from its nearest kindred, for another common Cebus, found in the\r\nsame parts of the forest, the Prego monkey (Cebus cirrhifer?), is a\r\nmuch quieter and better-tempered animal; it is full of tricks, but\r\nthese are generally of a playful character.\r\n\r\nThe Caiarára keeps the house in a perpetual uproar where it is kept:\r\nwhen alarmed, or hungry, or excited by envy, it screams piteously; it\r\nis always, however, making some noise or other, often screwing up its\r\nmouth and uttering a succession of loud notes resembling a whistle. My\r\nlittle pet, when loose, used to run after me, supporting itself for\r\nsome distance on its hind legs, without, however, having been taught to\r\ndo it. He offended me greatly one day, by killing, in one of his\r\njealous fits, another and much choicer pet—the nocturnal owl-faced\r\nmonkey (Nyctipithecus trivirgatus). Someone had given this a fruit,\r\nwhich the other coveted, so the two got to quarrelling. The\r\nNyctipithecus fought only with its paws, clawing out and hissing like a\r\ncat; the other soon obtained the mastery, and before I could interfere,\r\nfinished his rival by cracking its skull with his teeth. Upon this, I\r\ngot rid of him.\r\n\r\nOn recrossing the river to Aveyros in the evening, a pretty little\r\nparrot fell from a great height headlong into the water near the boat,\r\nhaving dropped from a flock which seemed to be fighting in the air. One\r\nof the Indians secured it for me, and I was surprised to find the bird\r\nuninjured. There had probably been a quarrel about mates, resulting in\r\nour little stranger being temporarily stunned by a blow on the head\r\nfrom the beak of a jealous comrade. The species was the Conurus\r\nguianensis, called by the natives Maracaná; the plumage green, with a\r\npatch of scarlet under the wings. I wished to keep the bird alive and\r\ntame it, but all our efforts to reconcile it to captivity were vain; it\r\nrefused food, bit everyone who went near it, and damaged its plumage in\r\nits exertions to free itself. My friends in Aveyros said that this kind\r\nof parrot never became domesticated. After trying nearly a week I was\r\nrecommended to lend the intractable creature to an old Indian woman,\r\nliving in the village, who was said to be a skilful bird-tamer. In two\r\ndays she brought it back almost as tame as the familiar love-birds of\r\nour aviaries. I kept my little pet for upwards of two years; it learned\r\nto talk pretty well, and was considered quite a wonder as being a bird\r\nusually so difficult of domestication. I do not know what arts the old\r\nwoman used: Captain Antonio said she fed it with her saliva. The chief\r\nreason why almost all animals become so wonderfully tame in the houses\r\nof the natives is, I believe, their being treated with uniform\r\ngentleness, and allowed to run at large about the rooms. Our Maracaná\r\nused to accompany us sometimes in our rambles, one of the lads carrying\r\nit on his head. One day, in the middle of a long forest road, it was\r\nmissed, having clung probably to an overhanging bough and escaped into\r\nthe thicket without the boy perceiving it. Three hours afterwards, on\r\nour return by the same path, a voice greeted using a colloquial tone as\r\nwe passed “Maracaná!” We looked about for some time, but could not see\r\nanything, until the word was repeated with emphasis “Maracaná-á!” When\r\nwe espied the little truant half concealed in the foliage of a tree, he\r\ncame down and delivered himself up, evidently as much rejoiced at the\r\nmeeting as we were.\r\n\r\nAfter I had obtained the two men promised, stout young Indians,\r\nseventeen or eighteen years of age, one named Ricardo and the other\r\nAlberto, I paid a second visit to the western side of the river in my\r\nown canoe; being determined, if possible, to obtain specimens of the\r\nWhite Cebus. We crossed over first to the mission village, Santa Cruz,\r\nwhich consists of thirty or forty wretched-looking mud huts, closely\r\nbuilt together in three straight ugly rows on a high gravelly bank. The\r\nplace was deserted, with the exception of two or three old men and\r\nwomen and a few children. A narrow belt of wood runs behind the\r\nvillage; beyond this is an elevated, barren campo with a clayey and\r\ngravelly soil. To the south, the coast country is of a similar\r\ndescription; a succession of scantily-wooded hills, bare grassy spaces,\r\nand richly-timbered hollows. We traversed forest and campo in various\r\ndirections during three days without meeting with monkeys, or indeed\r\nwith anything that repaid us the time and trouble. The soil of the\r\ndistrict appeared too dry; at this season of the year I had noticed, in\r\nother parts of the country, that mammals and birds resorted to the more\r\nhumid areas of forest; we therefore proceeded to explore carefully the\r\nlow and partly swampy tract along the coast to the north of Santa Cruz.\r\nWe spent two days in this way landing at many places, and penetrating a\r\ngood distance in the interior. Although unsuccessful with regard to the\r\nWhite Cebus, the time was not wholly lost, as I added several small\r\nbirds of species new to my collection. On the second evening we\r\nsurprised a large flock, composed of about fifty individuals, of a\r\ncurious eagle with a very long and slender hooked beak, the Rostrhamus\r\nhamatus. They were perched on the bushes which surrounded a shallow\r\nlagoon, separated from the river by a belt of floating grass; my men\r\nsaid they fed on toads and lizards found at the margins of pools. They\r\nformed a beautiful sight as they flew up and wheeled about at a great\r\nheight in the air. We obtained only one specimen.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Aveyros, we paid another visit to the Jacaré inlet,\r\nleading to Captain Antonio’s cattle farm, for the sake of securing\r\nfurther specimens of the many rare and handsome insects found there;\r\nlanding at the port of one of the settlers. The owner of the house was\r\nnot at home, and the wife, a buxom young woman, a dark mameluca, with\r\nclear though dark complexion and fine rosy cheeks, was preparing, in\r\ncompany with another stout-built Amazon, her rod and lines to go out\r\nfishing for the day’s dinner. It was now the season for Tucunarés, and\r\nSenora Joaquina showed us the fly baits used to take this kind of fish,\r\nwhich she had made with her own hands of parrots’ feathers. The rods\r\nused are slender bamboos, and the lines made from the fibres of\r\npine-apple leaves. It is not very common for the Indian and half-caste\r\nwomen to provide for themselves in the way these spirited dames were\r\ndoing, although they are all expert paddlers, and very frequently cross\r\nwide rivers in their frail boats without the aid of men. It is possible\r\nthat parties of Indian women, seen travelling alone in this manner, may\r\nhave given rise to the fable of a nation of Amazons, invented by the\r\nfirst Spanish explorers of the country. Senhora Joaquina invited me and\r\nJosé to a Tucunaré dinner for the afternoon, and then shouldering their\r\npaddles and tucking up their skirts, the two dusky fisherwomen marched\r\ndown to their canoe. We sent the two Indians into the woods to cut\r\npalm-leaves to mend the thatch of our cuberta, whilst José and I\r\nrambled through the woods which skirted the campo. On our return, we\r\nfound a most bountiful spread in the house of our hostess. A spotless\r\nwhite cloth was laid on the mat, with a plate for each guest and a pile\r\nof fragrant, newly-made farinha by the side of it. The boiled Tucunarés\r\nwere soon taken from the kettles and set before us. I thought the men\r\nmust be happy husbands who owned such wives as these. The Indian and\r\nmameluco women certainly do make excellent managers; they are more\r\nindustrious than the men, and most of them manufacture farinha for sale\r\non their own account, their credit always standing higher with the\r\ntraders on the river than that of their male connections. I was quite\r\nsurprised at the quantity of fish they had taken; there being\r\nsufficient for the whole party, including several children, two old men\r\nfrom a neighbouring hut, and my Indians. I made our good-natured\r\nentertainers a small present of needles and sewing-cotton, articles\r\nvery much prized, and soon after we re-embarked, and again crossed the\r\nriver to Aveyros.\r\n\r\n_August 2nd._—Left Aveyros; having resolved to ascend a branch river,\r\nthe Cuparí, which enters the Tapajos about eight miles above this\r\nvillage, instead of going forward along the main stream. I should have\r\nliked to visit the settlements of the Mundurucú tribe which lie beyond\r\nthe first cataract of the Tapajos, if it had been compatible with the\r\nother objects I had in view. But to perform this journey a lighter\r\ncanoe than mine would have been necessary, and six or eight Indian\r\npaddlers, which in my case it was utterly impossible to obtain. There\r\nwould be, however, an opportunity of seeing this fine race of people on\r\nthe Cuparí, as a horde was located towards the head waters of this\r\nstream. The distance from Aveyros to the last civilised settlement on\r\nthe Tapajos, Itaituba, is about forty miles. The falls commence a short\r\ndistance beyond this place. Ten formidable cataracts or rapids then\r\nsucceed each other at intervals of a few miles, the chief of which are\r\nthe Coaitá, the Buburé, the Salto Grande (about thirty feet high), and\r\nthe Montanha. The canoes of Cuyabá tradesmen which descend annually to\r\nSantarem are obliged to be unloaded at each of these, and the cargoes\r\ncarried by land on the backs of Indians, whilst the empty vessels are\r\ndragged by ropes over the obstruction. The Cuparí was described to me\r\nas flowing through a rich, moist clayey valley covered with forests and\r\nabounding in game; whilst the banks of the Tapajos beyond Aveyros were\r\nbarren sandy campos, with ranges of naked or scantily-wooded hills,\r\nforming a kind of country which I had always found very unproductive in\r\nNatural History objects in the dry season, which had now set in.\r\n\r\nWe entered the mouth of the Cuparí on the evening of the following day\r\n(August 3rd). It was not more than a hundred yards wide, but very deep:\r\nwe found no bottom in the middle with a line of eight fathoms. The\r\nbanks were gloriously wooded, the familiar foliage of the cacao growing\r\nabundantly amongst the mass of other trees, reminding me of the forests\r\nof the main Amazons. We rowed for five or six miles, generally in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, although the river had many abrupt bends, and\r\nstopped for the night at a settler’s house, situated on a high bank,\r\naccessible only by a flight of rude wooden steps fixed in the clayey\r\nslope. The owners were two brothers, half-breeds, who, with their\r\nfamilies, shared the large roomy dwelling; one of them was a\r\nblacksmith, and we found him working with two Indian lads at his forge\r\nin an open shed under the shade of mango trees. They were the sons of a\r\nPortuguese immigrant who had settled here forty years previously, and\r\nmarried a Mundurucú woman. He must have been a far more industrious man\r\nthan the majority of his countrymen who emigrate to Brazil nowadays,\r\nfor there were signs of former extensive cultivation at the back of the\r\nhouse in groves of orange, lemon, and coffee trees, and a large\r\nplantation of cacao occupied the lower grounds.\r\n\r\nThe next morning one of the brothers brought me a beautiful opossum,\r\nwhich had been caught in the fowl-house a little before sunrise. It was\r\nnot so large as a rat, and had soft brown fur, paler beneath and on the\r\nface, with a black stripe on each cheek. This made the third species of\r\nmarsupial rat I had so far obtained: but the number of these animals is\r\nvery considerable in Brazil, where they take the place of the shrews of\r\nEurope; shrew mice and, indeed, the whole of the insectivorous order of\r\nmammals, being entirely absent from Tropical America. One kind of these\r\nrat-like opossums is aquatic, and has webbed feet. The terrestrial\r\nspecies are nocturnal in their habits, sleeping during the day in\r\nhollow trees, and coming forth at night to prey on birds in their\r\nroosting places. It is very difficult to rear poultry in this country\r\non account of these small opossums, scarcely a night passing, in some\r\nparts, in which the fowls are not attacked by them.\r\n\r\n_August 5th._—The river reminds me of some parts of the Jaburú channel,\r\nbeing hemmed in by two walls of forest rising to the height of at least\r\na hundred feet, and the outlines of the trees being concealed\r\nthroughout by a dense curtain of leafy creepers. The impression of\r\nvegetable profusion and overwhelming luxuriance increases at every\r\nstep. The deep and narrow valley of the Cuparí has a moister climate\r\nthan the banks of the Tapajos. We have now frequent showers, whereas we\r\nleft everything parched up by the sun at Aveyros.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the last sitio we advanced about eight miles, and then\r\nstopped at the house of Senhor Antonio Malagueita, a mameluco settler,\r\nwhom we had been recommended to visit. His house and outbuildings were\r\nextensive, the grounds well weeded, and the whole wore an air of\r\ncomfort and well-being which is very uncommon in this country. A bank\r\nof indurated white clay sloped gently up from the tree-shaded port to\r\nthe house, and beds of kitchen-herbs extended on each side, with (rare\r\nsight!) rose and jasmine trees in full bloom. Senhor Antonio, a rather\r\ntall middle-aged man, with a countenance beaming with good nature, came\r\ndown to the port as soon as we anchored. I was quite a stranger to him,\r\nbut he had heard of my coming, and seemed to have made preparations. I\r\nnever met with a heartier welcome. On entering the house, the wife, who\r\nhad more of the Indian tint and features than her husband, was equally\r\nwarm and frank in her greeting. Senhor Antonio had spent his younger\r\ndays at Pará, and had acquired a profound respect for Englishmen. I\r\nstayed here two days. My host accompanied me in my excursions; in fact,\r\nhis attentions, with those of his wife, and the host of relatives of\r\nall degrees who constituted his household, were quite troublesome, as\r\nthey left me not a moment’s privacy from morning till night.\r\n\r\nWe had, together, several long and successful rambles along a narrow\r\npathway which extended several miles into the forest. I here met with a\r\nnew insect pest, one which the natives may be thankful is not spread\r\nmore widely over the country: it was a large brown fly of the Tabanidæ\r\nfamily (genus Pangonia), with a proboscis half an inch long and sharper\r\nthan the finest needle. It settled on our backs by twos and threes at a\r\ntime, and pricked us through our thick cotton shirts, making us start\r\nand cry out with the sudden pain. I secured a dozen or two as\r\nspecimens. As an instance of the extremely confined ranges of certain\r\nspecies, it may be mentioned that I did not find this insect in any\r\nother part of the country except along half a mile or so of this gloomy\r\nforest road.\r\n\r\nWe were amused at the excessive and almost absurd tameness of a fine\r\nMutum or Curassow turkey, that ran about the house. It was a large\r\nglossy-black species (the Mitu tuberosa), having an orange- coloured\r\nbeak, surmounted by a bean-shaped excrescence of the same hue. It\r\nseemed to consider itself as one of the family: attended all the meals,\r\npassing from one person to another round the mat to be fed, and rubbing\r\nthe sides of its head in a coaxing way against their cheeks or\r\nshoulders. At night it went to roost on a chest in a sleeping-room\r\nbeside the hammock of one of the little girls to whom it seemed\r\nparticularly attached, regularly following her wherever she went about\r\nthe grounds. I found this kind of Curassow bird was very common in the\r\nforest of the Cuparí; but it is rare on the Upper Amazons, where an\r\nallied species, which has a round instead of a bean-shaped waxen\r\nexcrescence on the beak (Crax globicera), is the prevailing kind. These\r\nbirds in their natural state never descend from the tops of the\r\nloftiest trees, where they live in small flocks and build their nests.\r\nThe Mitu tuberosa lays two rough-shelled, white eggs; it is fully as\r\nlarge a bird as the common turkey, but the flesh when cooked is drier\r\nand not so well flavoured. It is difficult to find the reason why these\r\nsuperb birds have not been reduced to domestication by the Indians,\r\nseeing that they so readily become tame. The obstacle offered by their\r\nnot breeding in confinement, which is probably owing to their arboreal\r\nhabits, might perhaps be overcome by repeated experiment; but for this\r\nthe Indians probably had not sufficient patience or intelligence. The\r\nreason cannot lie in their insensibility to the value of such birds,\r\nfor the common turkey, which has been introduced into the country, is\r\nmuch prized by them.\r\n\r\nWe had an unwelcome visitor whilst at anchor in the port of Antonio\r\nMalagueita. I was awakened a little after midnight, as I lay in my\r\nlittle cabin, by a heavy blow struck at the sides of the canoe close to\r\nmy head, which was succeeded by the sound of a weighty body plunging\r\ninto the water. I got up; but all was again quiet, except the cackle of\r\nfowls in our hen-coop, which hung over the side of the vessel about\r\nthree feet from the cabin door. I could find no explanation of the\r\ncircumstance, and, my men being all ashore, I turned in again and slept\r\nuntil morning. I then found my poultry loose about the canoe, and a\r\nlarge rent in the bottom of the hen-coop, which was about two feet from\r\nthe surface of the water: a couple of fowls were missing. Senhor\r\nAntonio said the depredator was a Sucurujú (the Indian name for the\r\nAnaconda, or great water serpent—Eunectes murinus), which had for\r\nmonths past been haunting this part of the river, and had carried off\r\nmany ducks and fowls from the ports of various houses. I was inclined\r\nto doubt the fact of a serpent striking at its prey from the water, and\r\nthought an alligator more likely to be the culprit, although we had not\r\nyet met with alligators in the river. Some days afterwards, the young\r\nmen belonging to the different sitios agreed together to go in search\r\nof the serpent. They began in a systematic manner, forming two parties,\r\neach embarked in three or four canoes, and starting from points several\r\nmiles apart, whence they gradually approximated, searching all the\r\nlittle inlets on both sides the river. The reptile was found at last,\r\nsunning itself on a log at the mouth of a muddy rivulet, and despatched\r\nwith harpoons. I saw it the day after it was killed; it was not a very\r\nlarge specimen, measuring only eighteen feet nine inches in length, and\r\nsixteen inches in circumference at the widest part of the body. I\r\nmeasured skins of the Anaconda afterwards, twenty-one feet in length\r\nand two feet in girth. The reptile has a most hideous appearance, owing\r\nto its being very broad in the middle and tapering abruptly at both\r\nends. It is very abundant in some parts of the country; nowhere more so\r\nthan in the Lago Grande, near Santarem, where it is often seen coiled\r\nup in the corners of farm-yards, and is detested for its habit of\r\ncarrying off poultry, young calves, or whatever animal it can get\r\nwithin reach of.\r\n\r\nAt Ega, a large Anaconda was once near making a meal of a young lad\r\nabout ten years of age, belonging to one of my neighbours. The father\r\nand his son went, as was their custom, a few miles up the Teffé to\r\ngather wild fruit, landing on a sloping sandy shore, where the boy was\r\nleft to mind the canoe whilst the man entered the forest. The beaches\r\nof the Teffé form groves of wild guava and myrtle trees, and during\r\nmost months of the year are partly overflown by the river. Whilst the\r\nboy was playing in the water under the shade of these trees, a huge\r\nreptile of this species stealthily wound its coils around him,\r\nunperceived until it was too late to escape. His cries brought the\r\nfather quickly to the rescue, who rushed forward, and seizing the\r\nAnaconda boldly by the head, tore his jaws asunder. There appears to be\r\nno doubt that this formidable serpent grows to an enormous bulk, and\r\nlives to a great age, for I heard of specimens having been killed which\r\nmeasured forty-two feet in length, or double the size of the largest I\r\nhad an opportunity to examine. The natives of the Amazons country\r\nuniversally believe in the existence of a monster water-serpent, said\r\nto be many score fathoms in length and which appears successively in\r\ndifferent parts of the river. They call it the Mai d’agoa—the mother,\r\nor spirit, of the water. This fable, which was doubtless suggested by\r\nthe occasional appearance of Sucurujus of unusually large size, takes a\r\ngreat variety of forms, and the wild legends form the subject of\r\nconversation amongst old and young, over the wood fires in lonely\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n_August 6th and 7th._—On leaving the sitio of Antonio Malagueita we\r\ncontinued our way along the windings of the river, generally in a\r\nsouth-east and south-south-east direction, but sometimes due north, for\r\nabout fifteen miles, when we stopped at the house of one Paulo Christo,\r\na mameluco whose acquaintance I had made at Aveyros. Here we spent the\r\nnight and part of the next day, doing in the morning a good five hours’\r\nwork in the forest, accompanied by the owner of the place. In the\r\nafternoon of the 7th, we were again under way; the river makes a bend\r\nto the east-north-east for a short distance above Paulo Christo’s\r\nestablishment, and then turns abruptly to the south-west, running from\r\nthat direction about four miles. The hilly country of the interior then\r\ncommences, the first token of it being a magnificently-wooded bluff,\r\nrising nearly straight from the water to a height of about 250 feet.\r\nThe breadth of the stream hereabout was not more than sixty yards, and\r\nthe forest assumed a new appearance from the abundance of the Urucuri\r\npalm, a species which has a noble crown of broad fronds with\r\nsymmetrical rigid leaflets.\r\n\r\nWe reached, in the evening, the house of the last civilised settler on\r\nthe river, Senhor Joao (John) Aracú, a wiry, active fellow and capital\r\nhunter, whom I wished to make a friend of and persuade to accompany me\r\nto the Mundurucú village and the falls of the Cuparí, some forty miles\r\nfurther up the river.\r\n\r\nI stayed at the sitio of John Aracú until the 19th, and again, in\r\ndescending, spent fourteen days at the same place. The situation was\r\nmost favourable for collecting the natural products of the district.\r\nThe forest was not crowded with underwood, and pathways led through it\r\nfor many miles and in various directions. I could make no use here of\r\nour two men as hunters, so, to keep them employed whilst José and I\r\nworked daily in the woods, I set them to make a montaria under John\r\nAracú’s directions. The first day a suitable tree was found for the\r\nshell of the boat, of the kind called Itaüba amarello, the yellow\r\nvariety of the stonewood. They felled it, and shaped out of the trunk a\r\nlog nineteen feet in length; this they dragged from the forest, with\r\nthe help of my host’s men, over a road they had previously made with\r\ncylindrical pieces of wood acting as rollers. The distance was about\r\nhalf a mile, and the ropes used for drawing the heavy load were tough\r\nlianas cut from the surrounding trees. This part of the work occupied\r\nabout a week: the log had then to be hollowed out, which was done with\r\nstrong chisels through a slit made down the whole length. The heavy\r\nportion of the task being then completed, nothing remained but to widen\r\nthe opening, fit two planks for the sides and the same number of\r\nsemicircular boards for the ends, make the benches, and caulk the\r\nseams.\r\n\r\nThe expanding of the log thus hollowed out is a critical operation, and\r\nnot always successful, many a good shell being spoiled from splitting\r\nor expanding irregularly. It is first reared on tressels, with the slit\r\ndownwards, over a large fire, which is kept up for seven or eight\r\nhours, the process requiring unremitting attention to avoid cracks and\r\nmake the plank bend with the proper dip at the two ends. Wooden\r\nstraddlers, made by cleaving pieces of tough elastic wood and fixing\r\nthem with wedges, are inserted into the opening, their compass being\r\naltered gradually as the work goes on, but in different degrees\r\naccording to the part of the boat operated upon. Our casca turned out a\r\ngood one: it took a long time to cool, and was kept in shape whilst it\r\ndid so by means of wooden cross-pieces. When the boat was finished, it\r\nwas launched with great merriment by the men, who hoisted coloured\r\nhandkerchiefs for flags, and paddled it up and down the stream to try\r\nits capabilities. My people had suffered as much inconvenience from the\r\nwant of a montaria as myself, so this was a day of rejoicing to all of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI was very successful at this place with regard to the objects of my\r\njourney. About twenty new species of fishes and a considerable number\r\nof small reptiles were added to my collection; but very few birds were\r\nmet with worth preserving. A great number of the most conspicuous\r\ninsects of the locality were new to me, and turned out to be species\r\npeculiar to this part of the Amazons valley. The most interesting\r\nacquisition was a large and handsome monkey, of a species I had not\r\nbefore met with—the white-whiskered Coaitá, or spider-monkey (Ateles\r\nmarginatus). I saw a pair one day in the forest moving slowly along the\r\nbranches of a lofty tree, and shot one of them; the next day John Aracu\r\nbrought down another, possibly the companion. The species is of about\r\nthe same size as the common black kind, of which I have given an\r\naccount in a former chapter, and has a similar lean body, with limbs\r\nclothed with coarse black hair; but it differs in having the whiskers\r\nand a triangular patch on the crown of the head of a white colour. I\r\nthought the meat the best flavoured I had ever tasted. It resembled\r\nbeef, but had a richer and sweeter taste. During the time of our stay\r\nin this part of the Cuparí, we could get scarcely anything but fish to\r\neat, and as this diet disagreed with me, three successive days of it\r\nreducing me to a state of great weakness, I was obliged to make the\r\nmost of our Coaitá meat. We smoke-dried the joints instead of salting\r\nthem, placing them for several hours upon a framework of sticks\r\narranged over a fire, a plan adopted by the natives to preserve fish\r\nwhen they have no salt, and which they call “muquiar.” Meat putrefies\r\nin this climate in less than twenty-four hours, and salting is of no\r\nuse, unless the pieces are cut in thin slices and dried immediately in\r\nthe sun. My monkeys lasted me about a fortnight, the last joint being\r\nan arm with the clenched fist, which I used with great economy, hanging\r\nit in the intervals, between my frugal meals, on a nail in the cabin.\r\nNothing but the hardest necessity could have driven me so near to\r\ncannibalism as this, but we had the greatest difficulty in obtaining\r\nhere a sufficient supply of animal food. About every three days the\r\nwork on the montaria had to be suspended, and all hands turned out for\r\nthe day to hunt and fish, in which they were often unsuccessful, for\r\nalthough there was plenty of game in the forest, it was too widely\r\nscattered to be available. Ricardo, and Alberto occasionally brought in\r\na tortoise or ant-eater, which served us for one day’s consumption. We\r\nmade acquaintance here with many strange dishes, amongst them Iguana\r\neggs; these are of oblong form, about an inch in length, and covered\r\nwith a flexible shell. The lizard lays about two score of them in the\r\nhollows of trees. They have an oily taste; the men ate them raw, beaten\r\nup with farinha, mixing a pinch of salt in the mess; I could only do\r\nwith them when mixed with Tucupí sauce, of which we had a large jar\r\nfull always ready to temper unsavoury morsels.\r\n\r\nOne day as I was entomologising alone and unarmed, in a dry Ygapó,\r\nwhere the trees were rather wide apart and the ground coated to the\r\ndepth of eight or ten inches with dead leaves, I was near coming into\r\ncollision with a boa constrictor. I had just entered a little thicket\r\nto capture an insect, and whilst pinning it was rather startled by a\r\nrushing noise in the vicinity. I looked up to the sky, thinking a\r\nsquall was coming on, but not a breath of wind stirred in the\r\ntree-tops. On stepping out of the bushes I met face to face a huge\r\nserpent coming down a slope, making the dry twigs crack and fly with\r\nhis weight as he moved over them. I had very frequently met with a\r\nsmaller boa, the Cutim-boia, in a similar way, and knew from the habits\r\nof the family that there was no danger, so I stood my ground. On seeing\r\nme the reptile suddenly turned and glided at an accelerated pace down\r\nthe path. Wishing to take a note of his probable size and the colours\r\nand markings of his skin, I set off after him; but he increased his\r\nspeed, and I was unable to get near enough for the purpose. There was\r\nvery little of the serpentine movement in his course. The rapidly\r\nmoving and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing\r\nover the thick bed of fallen leaves, rather than a serpent with skin of\r\nvaried colours. He descended towards the lower and moister parts of the\r\nYgapó. The huge trunk of an uprooted tree here lay across the road;\r\nthis he glided over in his undeviating course and soon after penetrated\r\na dense swampy thicket, where of course I did not choose to follow him.\r\n\r\nI suffered terribly from heat and mosquitoes as the river sank with the\r\nincreasing dryness of the season, although I made an awning of the\r\nsails to work under, and slept at night in the open air with my hammock\r\nslung between the masts. But there was no rest in any part; the canoe\r\ndescended deeper and deeper into the gulley through which the river\r\nflows between high clayey banks; as the water subsided, and with the\r\nglowing sun overhead we felt at midday as if in a furnace. I could bear\r\nscarcely any clothes in the daytime between eleven in the morning and\r\nfive in the afternoon, wearing nothing but loose and thin cotton\r\ntrousers and a light straw hat, and could not be accommodated in John\r\nAracu’s house, as it was a small one and full of noisy children. One\r\nnight we had a terrific storm. The heat in the afternoon had been\r\ngreater than ever, and at sunset the sky had a brassy glare, the black\r\npatches of cloud which floated in it being lighted up now and then by\r\nflashes of sheet lightning. The mosquitoes at night were more than\r\nusually troublesome, and I had just sunk exhausted into a doze towards\r\nthe early hours of morning when the storm began; a complete deluge of\r\nrain, with incessant lightning and rattling explosions of thunder. It\r\nlasted for eight hours; the grey dawn opening amidst the crash of the\r\ntempest. The rain trickled through the seams of the cabin roof on to my\r\ncollections, the late hot weather having warped the boards, and it gave\r\nme immense trouble to secure them in the midst of the confusion.\r\nAltogether I had a bad night of it; but what with storms, heat,\r\nmosquitoes, hunger, and, towards the last, ill health, I seldom had a\r\ngood night’s rest on the Cuparí.\r\n\r\nA small creek traversed the forest behind John Aracu’s house, and\r\nentered the river a few yards from our anchoring place; I used to cross\r\nit twice a day, on going and returning from my hunting ground. One day\r\nearly in September, I noticed that the water was two or three inches\r\nhigher in the afternoon than it had been in the morning. This\r\nphenomenon was repeated the next day, and in fact daily, until the\r\ncreek became dry with the continued subsidence of the Cuparí, the time\r\nof rising shifting a little from day to day. I pointed out the\r\ncircumstance to John Aracú, who had not noticed it before (it was only\r\nhis second year of residence in the locality), but agreed with me that\r\nit must be the “maré”; yes, the tide! the throb of the great oceanic\r\npulse felt in this remote corner, 530 miles distant from the place\r\nwhere it first strikes the body of fresh water at the mouth of the\r\nAmazons. I hesitated at first at this conclusion, but in reflecting\r\nthat the tide was known to be perceptible at Obydos, more than 400\r\nmiles from the sea, that at high water in the dry season a large flood\r\nfrom the Amazons enters the mouth of the Tapajos, and that there is but\r\na very small difference of level between that point and the Cuparí, a\r\nfact shown by the absence of current in the dry season. I could have no\r\ndoubt that this conclusion was a correct one.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the tide being felt 530 miles up the Amazons, passing from\r\nthe main stream to one of its affluents 380 miles from its mouth, and\r\nthence to a branch in the third degree, is a proof of the extreme\r\nflatness of the land which forms the lower part of the Amazonian\r\nvalley. This uniformity of level is shown also in the broad lake-like\r\nexpanses of water formed near their mouths by the principal affluents\r\nwhich cross the valley to join the main river.\r\n\r\n_August 21st._—John Aracú consented to accompany me to the falls with\r\none of his men to hunt and fish for me. One of my objects was to obtain\r\nspecimens of the hyacinthine macaw, whose range commences on all the\r\nbranch rivers of the Amazons which flow from the south through the\r\ninterior of Brazil, with the first cataracts. We started on the 19th;\r\nour direction on that day being generally southwest. On the 20th, our\r\ncourse was southerly and southeasterly. This morning (August 21st) we\r\narrived at the Indian settlement, the first house of which lies about\r\nthirty-one miles above the sitio of John Aracú. The river at this place\r\nis from sixty to seventy yards wide, and runs in a zigzag course\r\nbetween steep clayey banks, twenty to fifty feet in height. The houses\r\nof the Mundurucús, to the number of about thirty, are scattered along\r\nthe banks for a distance of six or seven miles. The owners appear to\r\nhave chosen all the most picturesque sites—tracts of level ground at\r\nthe foot of wooded heights, or little havens with bits of white sandy\r\nbeach—as if they had an appreciation of natural beauty. Most of the\r\ndwellings are conical huts, with walls of framework filled in with mud\r\nand thatched with palm leaves, the broad eaves reaching halfway to the\r\nground. Some are quadrangular, and do not differ in structure from\r\nthose of the semi-civilised settlers in other parts; others are open\r\nsheds or ranchos. They seem generally to contain not more than one or\r\ntwo families each.\r\n\r\nAt the first house, we learnt that all the fighting men had this\r\nmorning returned from a two days’ pursuit of a wandering horde of\r\nsavages of the Parárauáte tribe, who had strayed this way from the\r\ninterior lands and robbed the plantations. A little further on we came\r\nto the house of the Tushaúa, or chief, situated on the top of a high\r\nbank, which we had to ascend by wooden steps. There were four other\r\nhouses in the neighbourhood, all filled with people. A fine old fellow,\r\nwith face, shoulders, and breast tattooed all over in a cross-bar\r\npattern, was the first strange object that caught my eye. Most of the\r\nmen lay lounging or sleeping in their hammocks. The women were employed\r\nin an adjoining shed making farinha, many of them being quite naked,\r\nand rushing off to the huts to slip on their petticoats when they\r\ncaught sight of us. Our entrance aroused the Tushaúa from a nap; after\r\nrubbing his eyes he came forward and bade us welcome with the most\r\nformal politeness, and in very good Portuguese. He was a tall,\r\nbroad-shouldered, well-made man, apparently about thirty years of age,\r\nwith handsome regular features, not tattooed, and a quiet good-humoured\r\nexpression of countenance. He had been several times to Santarem and\r\nonce to Pará, learning the Portuguese language during these journeys.\r\nHe was dressed in shirt and trousers made of blue-checked cotton cloth,\r\nand there was not the slightest trace of the savage in his appearance\r\nor demeanour. I was told that he had come into the chieftainship by\r\ninheritance, and that the Cuparí horde of Mundurucús, over which his\r\nfathers had ruled before him, was formerly much more numerous,\r\nfurnishing 300 bows in time of war. They could now scarcely muster\r\nforty; but the horde has no longer a close political connection with\r\nthe main body of the tribe, which inhabits the banks of the Tapajos,\r\nsix days’ journey from the Cuparí settlement.\r\n\r\nI spent the remainder of the day here, sending Aracú and the men to\r\nfish, whilst I amused myself with the Tushaúa and his people. A few\r\nwords served to explain my errand on the river; he comprehended at once\r\nwhy white men should admire and travel to collect the beautiful birds\r\nand animals of his country, and neither he nor his people spoke a\r\nsingle word about trading, or gave us any trouble by coveting the\r\nthings we had brought. He related to me the events of the preceding\r\nthree days. The Parárauátes were a tribe of intractable savages, with\r\nwhom the Mundurucús have been always at war. They had no fixed abode,\r\nand of course made no plantations, but passed their lives like the wild\r\nbeasts, roaming through the forest, guided by the sun; wherever they\r\nfound themselves at night-time there they slept, slinging their bast\r\nhammocks, which are carried by the women, to the trees. They cross the\r\nstreams which lie in their course in bark canoes, which they make on\r\nreaching the water, and cast away after landing on the opposite side.\r\nThe tribe is very numerous, but the different hordes obey only their\r\nown chieftains. The Mundurucús of the upper Tapajos have an expedition\r\non foot against them at the present time, and the Tushaúa supposed that\r\nthe horde which had just been chased from his maloca were fugitives\r\nfrom that direction. There were about a hundred of them—including men,\r\nwomen, and children. Before they were discovered, the hungry savages\r\nhad uprooted all the macasheira, sweet potatoes, and sugar cane, which\r\nthe industrious Mundurucús had planted for the season, on the east side\r\nof the river. As soon as they were seen they made off, but the Tashaúa\r\nquickly got together all the young men of the settlement, about thirty\r\nin number, who armed themselves with guns, bows and arrows, and\r\njavelins, and started in pursuit. They tracked them, as before related,\r\nfor two days through the forest, but lost their traces on the further\r\nbank of the Cuparitinga, a branch stream flowing from the northeast.\r\nThe pursuers thought, at one time, they were close upon them, having\r\nfound the inextinguished fire of their last encampment. The footmarks\r\nof the chief could be distinguished from the rest by their great size\r\nand the length of the stride. A small necklace made of scarlet beans\r\nwas the only trophy of the expedition, and this the Tashaúa gave to me.\r\n\r\nI saw very little of the other male Indians, as they were asleep in\r\ntheir huts all the afternoon. There were two other tattooed men lying\r\nunder an open shed, besides the old man already mentioned. One of them\r\npresented a strange appearance, having a semicircular black patch in\r\nthe middle of his face, covering the bottom of the nose and mouth,\r\ncrossed lines on his back and breast, and stripes down his arms and\r\nlegs. It is singular that the graceful curved patterns used by the\r\nSouth Sea Islanders are quite unknown amongst the Brazilian red men;\r\nthey being all tattooed either in simple lines or patches. The nearest\r\napproach to elegance of design which I saw was amongst the Tucunas of\r\nthe Upper Amazons, some of whom have a scroll-like mark on each cheek,\r\nproceeding from the corner of the mouth. The taste, as far as form is\r\nconcerned, of the American Indian, would seem to be far less refined\r\nthan that of the Tahitian and New Zealander.\r\n\r\nTo amuse the Tashaúa, I fetched from the canoe the two volumes of\r\nKnight’s Pictorial Museum of Animated Nature. The engravings quite took\r\nhis fancy, and he called his wives, of whom, as I afterwards learned\r\nfrom Aracú, he had three or four, to look at them; one of them was a\r\nhandsome girl, decorated with necklace and bracelets of blue beads. In\r\na short time, others left their work, and I then had a crowd of women\r\nand children around me, who all displayed unusual curiosity for\r\nIndians. It was no light task to go through the whole of the\r\nillustrations, but they would not allow me to miss a page, making me\r\nturn back when I tried to skip. The pictures of the elephant, camels,\r\norang-otangs, and tigers, seemed most to astonish them; but they were\r\ninterested in almost everything, down even to the shells and insects.\r\nThey recognised the portraits of the most striking birds and mammals\r\nwhich are found in their own country; the jaguar, howling monkeys,\r\nparrots, trogons, and toucans. The elephant was settled to be a large\r\nkind of Tapir; but they made but few remarks, and those in the\r\nMundurucú language, of which I understood only two or three words.\r\nTheir way of expressing surprise was a clicking sound made with the\r\nteeth, similar to the one we ourselves use, or a subdued exclamation,\r\nHm! hm! Before I finished, from fifty to sixty had assembled; there was\r\nno pushing or rudeness, the grown-up women letting the young girls and\r\nchildren stand before them, and all behaved in the most quiet and\r\norderly manner possible.\r\n\r\nThe Mundurucús are perhaps the most numerous and formidable tribe of\r\nIndians now surviving in the Amazons region. They inhabit the shores of\r\nthe Tapajos (chiefly the right bank), from 3° to 7° south latitude, and\r\nthe interior of the country between that part of the river and the\r\nMadeira. On the Tapajos alone they can muster, I was told, 2000\r\nfighting men; the total population of the tribe may be about 20,000.\r\nThey were not heard of until about ninety years ago, when they made war\r\non the Portuguese settlements, their hosts crossing the interior of the\r\ncountry eastward of the Tapajos, and attacking the establishments of\r\nthe whites in the province of Maranham. The Portuguese made peace with\r\nthem in the beginning of the present century, the event being brought\r\nabout by the common cause of quarrel entertained by the two peoples\r\nagainst the hated Múras. They have ever since been firm friends of the\r\nwhites. It is remarkable how faithfully this friendly feeling has been\r\nhanded down amongst the Mundurucús, and spread to the remotest of the\r\nscattered hordes. Wherever a white man meets a family, or even an\r\nindividual of the tribe, he is almost sure to be reminded of this\r\nalliance. They are the most warlike of the Brazilian tribes, and are\r\nconsidered also the most settled and industrious; they are not,\r\nhowever, superior in this latter respect to the Jurís and Passés on the\r\nUpper Amazons, or the Uapés Indians near the headwaters of the Rio\r\nNegro. They make very large plantations of mandioca, and sell the\r\nsurplus produce, which amounts to, on the Tapajos, from 3000 to 5000\r\nbaskets (60 lbs. each) annually, to traders who ascend the river from\r\nSantarem between the months of August and January. They also gather\r\nlarge quantities of sarsaparilla, India-rubber, and Tonka beans, in the\r\nforests. The traders, on their arrival at the Campinas (the scantily\r\nwooded region inhabited by the main body of Mundurucús beyond the\r\ncataracts) have first to distribute their wares—cheap cotton cloths,\r\niron hatchets, cutlery, small wares, and cashaça—amongst the minor\r\nchiefs, and then wait three or four months for repayment in produce.\r\n\r\nA rapid change is taking place in the habits of these Indians through\r\nfrequent intercourse with the whites, and those who dwell on the banks\r\nof the Tapajos now seldom tattoo their children. The principal Tashaúa\r\nof the whole tribe or nation, named Joaquim, was rewarded with a\r\ncommission in the Brazilian army, in acknowledgment of the assistance\r\nhe gave to the legal authorities during the rebellion of 1835-6. It\r\nwould be a misnomer to call the Mundurucús of the Cuparí and many parts\r\nof the Tapajos savages; their regular mode of life, agricultural\r\nhabits, loyalty to their chiefs, fidelity to treaties, and gentleness\r\nof demeanour, give them a right to a better title. Yet they show no\r\naptitude for the civilised life of towns, and, like the rest of the\r\nBrazilian tribes, seem incapable of any further advance in culture. In\r\ntheir former wars they exterminated two of the neighbouring peoples,\r\nthe Júmas and the Jacarés, and make now an annual expedition against\r\nthe Parárauátes, and one or two other similar wild tribes who inhabit\r\nthe interior of the land. Additionally they are sometimes driven by\r\nhunger towards the banks of the great rivers to rob the plantations of\r\nthe agricultural Indians. These campaigns begin in July, and last\r\nthroughout the dry months; the women generally accompanying the\r\nwarriors to carry their arrows and javelins. They had the diabolical\r\ncustom, in former days, of cutting off the heads of their slain\r\nenemies, and preserving them as trophies around their houses. I believe\r\nthis, together with other savage practices, has been relinquished in\r\nthose parts where they have had long intercourse with the Brazilians,\r\nfor I could neither see nor hear anything of these preserved heads.\r\nThey used to sever the head with knives made of broad bamboo, and then,\r\nafter taking out the brain and fleshy parts, soak it in bitter\r\nvegetable oil (andiroba), and expose it for several days over the smoke\r\nof a fire or in the sun. In the tract of country between the Tapajos\r\nand the Madeira, a deadly war has been for many years carried on\r\nbetween the Mundurucús and the Aráras. I was told by a Frenchman at\r\nSantarem, who had visited that part, that all the settlements there\r\nhave a military organisation. A separate shed is built outside each\r\nvillage, where the fighting men sleep at night, sentinels being\r\nstationed to give the alarm with blasts of the Turé on the approach of\r\nthe Aráras, who choose the night for their onslaughts.\r\n\r\nEach horde of Mundurucús has its pajé or medicine man, who is the\r\npriest and doctor; he fixes upon the time most propitious for attacking\r\nthe enemy; exorcises evil spirits, and professes to cure the sick. All\r\nillness whose origin is not very apparent is supposed to be caused by a\r\nworm in the part affected. This the pajé pretends to extract; he blows\r\non the seat of pain the smoke from a large cigar, made with an air of\r\ngreat mystery by rolling tobacco in folds of Tauarí, and then sucks the\r\nplace, drawing from his mouth, when he has finished, what he pretends\r\nto be the worm. It is a piece of very clumsy conjuring. One of these\r\npajés was sent for by a woman in John Aracu’s family, to operate on a\r\nchild who suffered much from pains in the head. Senhor John contrived\r\nto get possession of the supposed worm after the trick was performed in\r\nour presence, and it turned out to be a long white air-root of some\r\nplant. The pajé was with difficulty persuaded to operate whilst Senhor\r\nJohn and I were present. I cannot help thinking that he, as well as all\r\nothers of the same profession, are conscious impostors, handing down\r\nthe shallow secret of their divinations and tricks from generation to\r\ngeneration. The institution seems to be common to all tribes of\r\nIndians, and to be held to more tenaciously than any other.\r\n\r\nI bought of the Tashaúa two beautiful feather sceptres, with their\r\nbamboo cases. These are of cylindrical shape, about three feet in\r\nlength and three inches in diameter, and are made by gluing with wax\r\nthe fine white and yellow feathers from the breast of the toucan on\r\nstout rods, the tops being ornamented with long plumes from the tails\r\nof parrots, trogons, and other birds. The Mundurucús are considered to\r\nbe the most expert workers in feathers of all the South American\r\ntribes. It is very difficult, however, to get them to part with the\r\narticles, as they seem to have a sort of superstitious regard for them.\r\nThey manufacture head-dresses, sashes, and tunics, besides sceptres;\r\nthe feathers being assorted with a good eye to the proper contrast of\r\ncolours, and the quills worked into strong cotton webs, woven with\r\nknitting sticks in the required shape. The dresses are worn only during\r\ntheir festivals, which are celebrated, not at stated times, but\r\nwhenever the Tashaúa thinks fit. Dancing, singing, sports, and\r\ndrinking, appear to be the sole objects of these occasional holidays.\r\nWhen a day is fixed upon, the women prepare a great quantity of tarobá,\r\nand the monotonous jingle is kept up, with little intermission, night\r\nand day, until the stimulating beverage is finished.\r\n\r\nWe left the Tashaúa’s house early the next morning. The impression made\r\nupon me by the glimpse of Indian life in its natural state obtained\r\nhere, and at another cluster of houses visited higher up, was a\r\npleasant one, notwithstanding the disagreeable incident of the\r\nParárauáte visit. The Indians are here seen to the best advantage;\r\nhaving relinquished many of their most barbarous practices, without\r\nbeing corrupted by too close contact with the inferior whites and\r\nhalf-breeds of the civilised settlements. The manners are simpler, the\r\ndemeanour more gentle, cheerful, and frank, than amongst the Indians\r\nwho live near the towns. I could not help contrasting their well-fed\r\ncondition, and the signs of orderly, industrious habits, with the\r\npoverty and laziness of the semi-civilised people of Altar do Chao. I\r\ndo not think that the introduction of liquors has been the cause of\r\nmuch harm to the Brazilian Indian. He has his drinking bout now and\r\nthen, like the common working people of other countries. It was his\r\nhabit in his original state, before Europeans visited his country, but\r\nhe is always ashamed of it afterwards, and remains sober during the\r\npretty long intervals. The harsh, slave-driving practices of the\r\nPortuguese and their descendants have been the greatest curses to the\r\nIndians; the Mundurucús of the Cuparí, however, have been now for many\r\nyears protected against ill-treatment. This is one of the good services\r\nrendered by the missionaries, who take care that the Brazilian laws in\r\nfavour of the aborigines shall be respected by the brutal and\r\nunprincipled traders who go amongst them. I think no Indians could be\r\nin a happier position than these simple, peaceful, and friendly people\r\non the banks of the Cuparí. The members of each family live together,\r\nand seem to be much attached to each other; and the authority of the\r\nchief is exercised in the mildest manner. Perpetual summer reigns\r\naround them; the land is of the highest fertility, and a moderate\r\namount of light work produces them all the necessaries of their simple\r\nlife. It is difficult to get at their notions on subjects that require\r\na little abstract thought; but the mind of the Indian is in a very\r\nprimitive condition. I believe he thinks of nothing except the matters\r\nthat immediately concern his daily material wants. There is an almost\r\ntotal absence of curiosity in his mental disposition, consequently, he\r\ntroubles himself very little concerning the causes of the natural\r\nphenomena around him. He has no idea of a Supreme Being; but, at the\r\nsame time, he is free from revolting superstitions—his religious\r\nnotions going no farther than the belief in an evil spirit, regarded\r\nmerely as a kind of hobgoblin, who is at the bottom of all his little\r\nfailures, troubles in fishing, hunting, and so forth. With so little\r\nmental activity, and with feelings and passions slow of excitement, the\r\nlife of these people is naturally monotonous and dull, and their\r\nvirtues are, properly speaking, only negative; but the picture of\r\nharmless, homely contentment they exhibit is very pleasing, compared\r\nwith the state of savage races in many other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe men awoke me at four o’clock with the sound of their oars on\r\nleaving the port of the Tashaúa. I was surprised to find a dense fog\r\nveiling all surrounding objects, and the air quite cold. The lofty wall\r\nof forest, with the beautiful crowns of Assai palms standing out from\r\nit on their slender, arching stems, looked dim and strange through the\r\nmisty curtain. The sudden change a little after sunrise had quite a\r\nmagical effect, for the mist rose up like the gauze veil before the\r\ntransformation scene at a pantomime, and showed the glorious foliage in\r\nthe bright glow of morning, glittering with dew drops. We arrived at\r\nthe falls about ten o’clock. The river here is not more than forty\r\nyards broad, and falls over a low ledge of rock stretching in a nearly\r\nstraight line across.\r\n\r\nWe had now arrived at the end of the navigation for large vessels—a\r\ndistance from the mouth of the river, according to our rough\r\ncalculation, of a little over seventy miles. I found it the better\r\ncourse now to send José and one of the men forward in the montaria with\r\nJohn Aracú, and remain myself with the cuberta and our other man to\r\ncollect in the neighbouring forest. We stayed here four days, one of\r\nthe boats returning each evening from the upper river with the produce\r\nof the day’s chase of my huntsmen. I obtained six good specimens of the\r\nhyacinthine macaw, besides a number of smaller birds, a species new to\r\nme of Guaríba, or howling monkey, and two large lizards. The Guaríba\r\nwas an old male, with the hair much worn from his rump and breast, and\r\nhis body disfigured with large tumours made by the grubs of a gad-fly\r\n(Œstrus). The back and tail were of a ruddy-brown colour, the limbs,\r\nand underside of the body, black. The men ascended to the second falls,\r\nwhich form a cataract several feet in height, about fifteen miles\r\nbeyond our anchorage. The macaws were found feeding in small flocks on\r\nthe fruit of the Tucumá palm (Astryocaryum Tucumá), the excessively\r\nhard nut of which is crushed into pulp by the powerful beak of the\r\nbird. I found the craws of all the specimens filled with the sour paste\r\nto which the stone-like fruit had been reduced. Each bird took me three\r\nhours to skin, and I was occupied with these and my other specimens\r\nevery evening until midnight, after my own laborious day’s hunt;\r\nworking on the roof of my cabin by the light of a lamp.\r\n\r\nThe place where the cuberta was anchored formed a little rocky haven,\r\nwith a sandy beach sloping to the forest, within which were the ruins\r\nof an Indian Maloca, and a large weed-grown plantation. The port\r\nswarmed with fishes, whose movements it was amusing to watch in the\r\ndeep, clear water. The most abundant were the Piránhas. One species,\r\nwhich varied in length, according to age, from two to six inches, but\r\nwas recognisable by a black spot at the root of the tail, was always\r\nthe quickest to seize any fragment of meat thrown into the water. When\r\nnothing was being given to them, a few only were seen scattered about,\r\ntheir heads all turned one way in an attitude of expectation; but as\r\nsoon as any offal fell from the canoe, the water was blackened with the\r\nshoals that rushed instantaneously to the spot. Those who did not\r\nsucceed in securing a fragment, fought with those who had been more\r\nsuccessful, and many contrived to steal the coveted morsels from their\r\nmouths. When a bee or fly passed through the air near the water, they\r\nall simultaneously darted towards it as if roused by an electric shock.\r\nSometimes a larger fish approached, and then the host of Piránhas took\r\nthe alarm and flashed out of sight. The population of the water varied\r\nfrom day to day. Once a small shoal of a handsome black-banded fish,\r\ncalled by the natives Acará bandeira (Mesonauta insignis, of Günther),\r\ncame gliding through at a slow pace, forming a very pretty sight. At\r\nanother time, little troops of needle-fish, eel-like animals with\r\nexcessively long and slender toothed jaws, sailed through the field,\r\nscattering before them the hosts of smaller fry; and at the rear of the\r\nneedle-fishes, a strangely-shaped kind called Sarapó came wriggling\r\nalong, one by one, with a slow movement. We caught with hook and line,\r\nbaited with pieces of banana, several Curimatá (Anodus Amazonum), a\r\nmost delicious fish, which, next to the Tucunare and the Pescada, is\r\nmost esteemed by the natives. The Curimatá seemed to prefer the middle\r\nof the stream, where the waters were agitated beneath the little\r\ncascade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcará (Mesonauta insignis).\r\n\r\nThe weather was now settled and dry, and the river sank rapidly— six\r\ninches in twenty-four hours. In this remote and solitary spot I can say\r\nthat I heard for the first and almost the only time the uproar of life\r\nat sunset, which Humboldt describes as having witnessed towards the\r\nsources of the Orinoco, but which is unknown on the banks of the larger\r\nrivers. The noises of animals began just as the sun sank behind the\r\ntrees after a sweltering afternoon, leaving the sky above of the\r\nintensest shade of blue. Two flocks of howling monkeys, one close to\r\nour canoe, the other about a furlong distant, filled the echoing\r\nforests with their dismal roaring. Troops of parrots, including the\r\nhyacinthine macaw we were in search of, began then to pass over; the\r\ndifferent styles of cawing and screaming of the various species making\r\na terrible discord. Added to these noises were the songs of strange\r\nCicadas, one large kind perched high on the trees around our little\r\nhaven setting up a most piercing chirp; it began with the usual harsh\r\njarring tone of its tribe, but this gradually and rapidly became\r\nshriller, until it ended in a long and loud note resembling the\r\nsteam-whistle of a locomotive engine. Half-a-dozen of these wonderful\r\nperformers made a considerable item in the evening concert. I had heard\r\nthe same species before at Pará, but it was there very uncommon: we\r\nobtained one of them here for my collection by a lucky blow with a\r\nstone. The uproar of beasts, birds, and insects lasted but a short\r\ntime: the sky quickly lost its intense hue, and the night set in. Then\r\nbegan the tree-frogs—quack-quack, drum-drum, hoo-hoo; these,\r\naccompanied by a melancholy night-jar, kept up their monotonous cries\r\nuntil very late.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarapó (Carapus). Needle-fish (Hemaramphus).\r\n\r\nMy men encountered on the banks of the stream a Jaguar and a black\r\nTiger, and were very much afraid of falling in with the Parárauátes, so\r\nthat I could not, after their return on the fourth day, induce them to\r\nundertake another journey. We began our descent of the river in the\r\nevening of the 26th of August. At night forest and river were again\r\nenveloped in mist, and the air before sunrise was quite cold. There is\r\na considerable current from the falls to the house of John Aracú, and\r\nwe accomplished the distance, with its aid and by rowing, in seventeen\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_September 21st._—At five o’clock in the afternoon we emerged from the\r\nconfined and stifling gully through which the Cuparí flows, into the\r\nbroad Tapajos, and breathed freely again. How I enjoyed the extensive\r\nview after being so long pent up: the mountainous coasts, the grey\r\ndistance, the dark waters tossed by a refreshing breeze! Heat,\r\nmosquitoes, insufficient and bad food, hard work and anxiety, had\r\nbrought me to a very low state of health; and I was now anxious to make\r\nall speed back to Santarem.\r\n\r\nWe touched at Aveyros, to embark some chests I had left there and to\r\nsettle accounts with Captain Antonio, and found nearly all the people\r\nsick with fever and vomit, against which the Padre’s homoeopathic\r\nglobules were of no avail. The Tapajos had been pretty free from\r\nepidemics for some years past, although it was formerly a very\r\nunhealthy river. A sickly time appeared to be now returning; in fact,\r\nthe year following my visit (1853) was the most fatal one ever\r\nexperienced in this part of the country. A kind of putrid fever broke\r\nout, which attacked people of all races alike. The accounts we received\r\nat Santarem were most distressing: my Cuparí friends especially\r\nsuffered very severely. John Aracú and his family all fell victims,\r\nwith the exception of his wife; my kind friend Antonio Malagueita also\r\ndied, and a great number of people in the Mundurucú village.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the Tapajos in the height of the dry season, which was\r\nnow close at hand, is very hazardous on account of the strong winds,\r\nabsence of current, and shoaly water far away from the coasts. The\r\nriver towards the end of September is about thirty feet shallower than\r\nin June; and in many places, ledges of rock are laid bare, or covered\r\nwith only a small depth of water. I had been warned of these\r\ncircumstances by my Cuparí friends, but did not form an adequate idea\r\nof what we should have to undergo. Canoes, in descending, only travel\r\nat night, when the terral, or light land-breeze, blows off the eastern\r\nshore. In the day-time a strong wind rages from down river, against\r\nwhich it is impossible to contend as there is no current, and the swell\r\nraised by its sweeping over scores of miles of shallow water is\r\ndangerous to small vessels. The coast for the greater part of the\r\ndistance affords no shelter; there are, however, a number of little\r\nharbours, called _esperas_, which the canoemen calculate upon,\r\ncarefully arranging each night-voyage so as to reach one of them before\r\nthe wind begins the next morning.\r\n\r\nWe left Aveyros in the evening of the 21st, and sailed gently down with\r\nthe soft land-breeze, keeping about a mile from the eastern shore. It\r\nwas a brilliant moonlit night, and the men worked cheerfully at the\r\noars when the wind was slack, the terral wafting from the forest a\r\npleasant perfume like that of mignonette. At midnight we made a fire\r\nand got a cup of coffee, and at three o’clock in the morning reached\r\nthe sitio of Ricardo’s father, an Indian named André, where we anchored\r\nand slept.\r\n\r\n_September 22nd._—Old André with his squaw came aboard this morning.\r\nThey brought three Tracajás, a turtle, and a basketful of Tracajá eggs,\r\nto exchange with me for cotton cloth and cashaça. Ricardo, who had been\r\nfor some time very discontented, having now satisfied his longing to\r\nsee his parents, cheerfully agreed to accompany me to Santarem. The\r\nloss of a man at this juncture would have been very annoying, with\r\nCaptain Antonio ill at Aveyros, and not a hand to be had anywhere in\r\nthe neighbourhood; but, if we had not called at André’s sitio, we\r\nshould not have been able to have kept Ricardo from running away at the\r\nfirst landing-place. He was a lively, restless lad, and although\r\nimpudent and troublesome at first, had made a very good servant. His\r\ncompanion, Alberto, was of quite a different disposition, being\r\nextremely taciturn, and going through all his duties with the quietest\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nWe left at 11 a.m., and progressed a little before the wind began to\r\nblow from down river, when we were obliged again to cast anchor. The\r\nterral began at six o’clock in the evening, and we sailed with it past\r\nthe long line of rock-bound coast near Itapuáma. At ten o’clock a\r\nfurious blast of wind came from a cleft between the hills, catching us\r\nwith the sails close-hauled, and throwing the canoe nearly on its\r\nbeam-ends, when we were about a mile from the shore. José had the\r\npresence of mind to slacken the sheet of the mainsail, whilst I leapt\r\nforward and lowered the sprit of the foresail, the two Indians standing\r\nstupefied in the prow. It was what the canoe-men call a _trovoada\r\nsecca_ or white squall. The river in a few minutes became a sheet of\r\nfoam; the wind ceased in about half an hour, but the terral was over\r\nfor the night, so we pulled towards the shore to find an anchoring\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe reached Tapaiuna by midnight on the 23rd, and on the morning of the\r\n24th arrived at the Retiro, where we met a shrewd Santarem trader, whom\r\nI knew, Senhor Chico Honorio, who had a larger and much better provided\r\ncanoe than our own. The wind was strong from below all day, so we\r\nremained at this place in his company. He had his wife with him, and a\r\nnumber of Indians, male and female. We slung our hammocks under the\r\ntrees, and breakfasted and dined together, our cloth being spread on\r\nthe sandy beach in the shade after killing a large quantity of fish\r\nwith _timbó_, of which we had obtained a supply at Itapuáma. At night\r\nwe were again under way with the land breeze. The water was shoaly to a\r\ngreat distance off the coast, and our canoe having the lighter draught\r\nwent ahead, our leadsman crying out the soundings to our companion: the\r\ndepth was only one fathom, half a mile from the coast. We spent the\r\nnext day (25th) at the mouth of a creek called Pini, which is exactly\r\nopposite the village of Boim, and on the following night advanced about\r\ntwelve miles. Every point of land had a long spit of sand stretching\r\none or two miles towards the middle of the river, which it was\r\nnecessary to double by a wide circuit. The terral failed us at midnight\r\nwhen we were near an _ espera_, called Maraï, the mouth of a shallow\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\n_September 26th._—I did not like the prospect of spending the whole\r\ndreary day at Maraï, where it was impossible to ramble ashore, the\r\nforest being utterly impervious, and the land still partly under water.\r\nBesides, we had used up our last stick of firewood to boil our coffee\r\nat sunrise, and could not get a fresh supply at this place. So there\r\nbeing a dead calm on the river in the morning, I gave orders at ten\r\no’clock to move out of the harbour, and try with the oars to reach\r\nPaquiatúba, which was only five miles distant. We had doubled the\r\nshoaly point which stretches from the mouth of the creek, and were\r\nmaking way merrily across the bay, at the head of which was the port of\r\nthe little settlement, when we beheld to our dismay, a few miles down\r\nthe river, the signs of the violent day breeze coming down upon us—a\r\nlong, rapidly advancing line of foam with the darkened water behind it.\r\nOur men strove in vain to gain the harbour; the wind overtook us, and\r\nwe cast anchor in three fathoms, with two miles of shoaly water between\r\nus and the land on our lee. It came with the force of a squall: the\r\nheavy billows washing over the vessel and drenching us with the spray.\r\nI did not expect that our anchor would hold; I gave out, however,\r\nplenty of cable and watched the result at the prow, José placing\r\nhimself at the helm, and the men standing by the jib and foresail, so\r\nas to be ready if we dragged to attempt the passage of the Maraï spit,\r\nwhich was now almost dead to leeward. Our little bit of iron, however,\r\nheld its place; the bottom being fortunately not so sandy as in most\r\nother parts of the coast; but our weak cable then began to cause us\r\nanxiety. We remained in this position all day without food, for\r\neverything was tossing about in the hold; provision-chests, baskets,\r\nkettles, and crockery. The breeze increased in strength towards the\r\nevening, when the sun set fiery red behind the misty hills on the\r\nwestern shore, and the gloom of the scene was heightened by the strange\r\ncontrasts of colour; the inky water and the lurid gleam of the sky.\r\nHeavy seas beat now and then against the prow of our vessel with a\r\nforce that made her shiver. If we had gone ashore in this place, all my\r\nprecious collections would have been inevitably lost; but we ourselves\r\ncould have scrambled easily to land, and re-embarked with Senhor\r\nHonorio, who had remained behind in the Piní, and would pass in the\r\ncourse of two or three days. When night came I lay down exhausted with\r\nwatching and fatigue, and fell asleep, as my men had done sometime\r\nbefore. About nine o’clock, I was awakened by the montaria bumping\r\nagainst the sides of the vessel, which had veered suddenly round, and\r\nthe full moon, previously astern, then shone full in the cabin. The\r\nwind had abruptly ceased, giving place to light puffs from the eastern\r\nshore, and leaving a long swell rolling into the shoaly bay.\r\n\r\nAfter this I resolved not to move a step beyond Paquiatúba without an\r\nadditional man, and one who understood the navigation of the river at\r\nthis season. We reached the landing-place at ten o’clock, and anchored\r\nwithin the mouth of the creek. In the morning I walked through the\r\nbeautiful shady alleys of the forest, which were water-paths in June\r\nwhen we touched here in ascending the river to the house of Inspector\r\nCypriano. After an infinite deal of trouble, I succeeded in persuading\r\nhim to furnish me with another Indian. There are about thirty families\r\nestablished in this place, but the able-bodied men had been nearly all\r\ndrafted off within the last few weeks by the Government, to accompany a\r\nmilitary expedition against runaway negroes, settled in villages in the\r\ninterior. Senhor Cypriano was a pleasant-looking and extremely civil\r\nyoung Mameluco. He accompanied us, on the night of the 28th, five miles\r\ndown the river to Point Jaguararí, where the man lived whom he intended\r\nto send with me. I was glad to find my new hand a steady, middle-aged\r\nand married Indian; his name was of very good promise, Angelo Custodio\r\n(Guardian Angel).\r\n\r\nPoint Jaguararí forms at this season of the year a high sandbank, which\r\nis prolonged as a narrow spit, stretching about three miles towards the\r\nmiddle of the river. We rounded this with great difficulty on the night\r\nof the 29th, reaching before daylight a good shelter behind a similar\r\nsandbank at Point Acarátingari, a headland situated not more than five\r\nmiles in a straight line from our last anchoring place. We remained\r\nhere all day; the men beating _timbó_ in a quiet pool between the\r\nsandbank and the mainland, and obtaining a great quantity of fish, from\r\nwhich I selected six species new to my collection. We made rather\r\nbetter progress the two following nights, but the terral now always\r\nblew strongly from the north-north-east after midnight, and thus\r\nlimited the hours during which we could navigate, forcing us to seek\r\nthe nearest shelter to avoid being driven back faster than we came.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of October, we reached Point Cajetúba and had a pleasant day\r\nashore. The river scenery in this neighbourhood is of the greatest\r\nbeauty. A few houses of settlers are seen at the bottom of the broad\r\nbay of Aramána-í at the foot of a range of richly-timbered hills, the\r\nhigh beach of snow-white sand stretching in a bold curve from point to\r\npoint. The opposite shores of the river are ten or eleven miles\r\ndistant, but towards the north is a clear horizon of water and sky. The\r\ncountry near Point Cajetúba is similar to the neighbourhood of\r\nSantarem: namely, campos with scattered trees. We gathered a large\r\nquantity of wild fruit: Cajú, Umirí, and Aápiránga. The Umirí berry\r\n(Humirium floribundum) is a black drupe similar in appearance to the\r\nDamascene plum, and not greatly unlike it in taste. The Aápiránga is a\r\nbright vermilion-coloured berry, with a hard skin and a sweet viscid\r\npulp enclosing the seeds. Between the point and Altar do Chao was a\r\nlong stretch of sandy beach with moderately deep water; our men,\r\ntherefore, took a rope ashore and towed the cuberta at merry speed\r\nuntil we reached the village. A long, deeply laden canoe with miners\r\nfrom the interior provinces passed us here. It was manned by ten\r\nIndians, who propelled the boat by poles; the men, five on each side,\r\ntrotting one after the other along a plank arranged for the purpose\r\nfrom stem to stern.\r\n\r\nIt took us two nights to double Point Cururú, where, as already\r\nmentioned, the river bends from its northerly course beyond Altar do\r\nChao. A confused pile of rocks, on which many a vessel heavily laden\r\nwith farinha has been wrecked, extends at the season of low water from\r\nthe foot of a high bluff far into the stream. We were driven back on\r\nthe first night (October 3rd) by a squall. The light terral was\r\ncarrying us pleasantly round the spit, when a small black cloud which\r\nlay near the rising moon suddenly spread over the sky to the northward;\r\nthe land breeze then ceased, and furious blasts began to blow across\r\nthe river. We regained, with great difficulty, the shelter of the\r\npoint. It blew almost a hurricane for two hours, during the whole of\r\nwhich time the sky over our heads was beautifully clear and starlit.\r\nOur shelter at first was not very secure, for the wind blew away the\r\nlashings of our sails, and caused our anchor to drag. Angelo Custodio,\r\nhowever, seized a rope which was attached to the foremast, and leapt\r\nashore; had he not done so, we should probably have been driven many\r\nmiles backwards up the storm-tossed river. After the cloud had passed,\r\nthe regular east wind began to blow, and our further progress was\r\neffectually stopped for the night. The next day we all went ashore,\r\nafter securing well the canoe, and slept from eleven o’clock till five\r\nunder the shade of trees.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Point Cururú and Santarem was accomplished in\r\nthree days, against the same difficulties of contrary and furious\r\nwinds, shoaly water, and rocky coasts. I was thankful at length to be\r\nsafely housed, with the whole of my collections, made under so many\r\nprivations and perils, landed without the loss or damage of a specimen.\r\nThe men, after unloading the canoe and delivering it to its owner, came\r\nto receive their payment. They took part in goods and part in money,\r\nand after a good supper, on the night of the 7th October, shouldered\r\ntheir bundles and set off to walk by land some eighty miles to their\r\nhomes. I was rather surprised at the good feeling exhibited by these\r\npoor Indians at parting. Angelo Custodio said that whenever I should\r\nwish to make another voyage up the Tapajos, he would be always ready to\r\nserve me as pilot. Alberto was undemonstrative as usual; but Ricardo,\r\nwith whom I had had many sharp quarrels, actually shed tears when he\r\nshook hands and bid me the final “adios.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\nTHE UPPER AMAZONS—VOYAGE TO EGA\r\n\r\n\r\nDeparture from Barra — First Day and Night on the Upper Amazons —\r\nDesolate Appearance of River in the Flood Season — Cucáma Indians —\r\nMental Condition of Indians — Squalls — Manatee — Forest — Floating\r\nPumice Stones from the Andes — Falling Banks — Ega and its Inhabitants\r\n— Daily Life of a Naturalist at Ega — The Four Seasons of the Upper\r\nAmazons.\r\n\r\nI must now take the reader from the picturesque, hilly country of the\r\nTapajos, and its dark, streamless waters, to the boundless wooded\r\nplains, and yellow turbid current of the Upper Amazons or Solimoens. I\r\nwill resume the narrative of my first voyage up the river, which was\r\ninterrupted at the Barra of the Rio Negro in the seventh chapter, to\r\nmake way for the description of Santarem and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI embarked at Barra on the 26th of March, 1850, three years before\r\nsteamers were introduced on the upper river, in a cuberta which was\r\nreturning to Ega, the first and only town of any importance in the vast\r\nsolitudes of the Solimoens, from Santarem, whither it had been sent,\r\nwith a cargo of turtle oil in earthenware jars. The owner, an old\r\nwhite-haired Portuguese trader of Ega named Daniel Cardozo, was then at\r\nBarra attending the assizes as juryman, a public duty performed without\r\nremuneration, which took him six weeks away from his business. He was\r\nabout to leave Barra himself, in a small boat, and recommended me to\r\nsend forward my heavy baggage in the cuberta and make the journey with\r\nhim. He would reach Ega, 370 miles distant from Barra, in twelve or\r\nfourteen days; whilst the large vessel would be thirty or forty days on\r\nthe road. I preferred, however, to go in company with my luggage,\r\nlooking forward to the many opportunities I should have of landing and\r\nmaking collections on the banks of the river.\r\n\r\nI shipped the collections made between Pará and the Rio Negro in a\r\nlarge cutter which was about descending to the capital, and after a\r\nheavy day’s work got all my chests aboard the Ega canoe by eight\r\no’clock at night. The Indians were then all embarked, one of them being\r\nbrought dead drunk by his companions, and laid to sober himself all\r\nnight on the wet boards of the tombadilha. The cabo, a spirited young\r\nwhite, named Estulano Alves Carneiro, who has since risen to be a\r\ndistinguished citizen of the new province of the Upper Amazons, soon\r\nafter gave orders to get up the anchor. The men took to the oars, and\r\nin a few hours we crossed the broad mouth of the Rio Negro; the night\r\nbeing clear, calm, and starlit, and the surface of the inky waters\r\nsmooth as a lake.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the next morning, we were progressing by espia along the\r\nleft bank of the Solimoens. The rainy season had now set in over the\r\nregion through which the great river flows; the sand-banks and all the\r\nlower lands were already under water, and the tearing current, two or\r\nthree miles in breadth, bore along a continuous line of uprooted trees\r\nand islets of floating plants. The prospect was most melancholy; no\r\nsound was heard but the dull murmur of the waters; the coast along\r\nwhich we travelled all day was encumbered every step of the way with\r\nfallen trees, some of which quivered in the currents which set around\r\nprojecting points of land. Our old pest, the Motúca, began to torment\r\nus as soon as the sun gained power in the morning. White egrets were\r\nplentiful at the edge of the water, and humming-birds, in some places,\r\nwere whirring about the flowers overhead. The desolate appearance of\r\nthe landscape increased after sunset, when the moon rose in mist.\r\n\r\nThis upper river, the Alto-Amazonas, or Solimoens, is always spoken of\r\nby the Brazilians as a distinct stream. This is partly owing, as before\r\nremarked, to the direction it seems to take at the fork of the Rio\r\nNegro; the inhabitants of the country, from their partial knowledge,\r\nnot being able to comprehend the whole river system in one view. It\r\nhas, however, many peculiarities to distinguish it from the lower\r\ncourse of the river. The trade-wind, or sea-breeze, which reaches, in\r\nthe height of the dry season, as far as the mouth of the Rio Negro, 900\r\nor 1000 miles from the Atlantic, never blows on the upper river. The\r\natmosphere is therefore more stagnant and sultry, and the winds that do\r\nprevail are of irregular direction and short duration. A great part of\r\nthe land on the borders of the Lower Amazons is hilly; there are\r\nextensive campos, or open plains, and long stretches of sandy soil\r\nclothed with thinner forests. The climate, in consequence, is\r\ncomparatively dry many months in succession during the fine season\r\npassing without rain. All this is changed on the Solimoens. A fortnight\r\nof clear sunny weather is a rarity: the whole region through which the\r\nriver and its affluents flow, after leaving the easternmost ridges of\r\nthe Andes, which Pöppig describes as rising like a wall from the level\r\ncountry, 240 miles from the Pacific, is a vast plain, about 1000 miles\r\nin length, and 500 or 600 in breadth, covered with one uniform, lofty,\r\nimpervious, and humid forest. The soil is nowhere sandy, but always\r\neither a stiff clay, alluvium, or vegetable mold, which the latter, in\r\nmany places, is seen in water-worn sections of the river banks to be\r\ntwenty or thirty feet in depth. With such a soil and climate, the\r\nluxuriance of vegetation, and the abundance and beauty of animal forms\r\nwhich are already so great in the region nearer the Atlantic, increase\r\non the upper river. The fruits, both wild and cultivated, common to the\r\ntwo sections of the country, reach a progressively larger size in\r\nadvancing westward, and some trees, which blossom only once a year at\r\nPará and Santarem, yield flower and fruit all the year round at Ega.\r\nThe climate is healthy, although one lives here as in a permanent\r\nvapour bath. I must not, however, give here a lengthy description of\r\nthe region whilst we are yet on its threshold. I resided and travelled\r\non the Solimoens altogether for four years and a half. The country on\r\nits borders is a magnificent wilderness where civilised man, as yet,\r\nhas scarcely obtained a footing; the cultivated ground from the Rio\r\nNegro to the Andes amounting only to a few score acres. Man, indeed, in\r\nany condition, from his small numbers, makes but an insignificant\r\nfigure in these vast solitudes. It may be mentioned that the Solimoens\r\nis 2130 miles in length, if we reckon from the source of what is\r\nusually considered the main stream (Lake Lauricocha, near Lima); but\r\n2500 miles by the route of the Ucayali, the most considerable and\r\npracticable fork of the upper part of the river. It is navigable at all\r\nseasons by large steamers for upwards of 1400 miles from the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th we passed the mouth of Ariauü, a narrow inlet which\r\ncommunicates with the Rio Negro, emerging in front of Barra. Our vessel\r\nwas nearly drawn into this by the violent current which set from the\r\nSolimoens. The towing-cable was lashed to a strong tree about thirty\r\nyards ahead, and it took the whole strength of crew and passengers to\r\npull across. We passed the Guariba, a second channel connecting the two\r\nrivers, on the 30th, and on the 31st sailed past a straggling\r\nsettlement called Manacápurú, situated on a high, rocky bank. Many\r\ncitizens of Barra have _sitios_, or country-houses, in this place,\r\nalthough it is eighty miles distant from the town by the nearest road.\r\nBeyond Manacápurú all traces of high land cease; both shores of the\r\nriver, henceforward for many hundred miles, are flat, except in places\r\nwhere the Tabatinga formation appears in clayey elevations of from\r\ntwenty to forty feet above the line of highest water. The country is so\r\ncompletely destitute of rocky or gravelly beds that not a pebble is\r\nseen during many weeks’ journey. Our voyage was now very monotonous.\r\nAfter leaving the last house at Manacápurú, we travelled nineteen days\r\nwithout seeing a human habitation, the few settlers being located on\r\nthe banks of inlets or lakes some distance from the shores of the main\r\nriver. We met only one vessel during the whole of the time, and this\r\ndid not come within hail, as it was drifting down in the middle of the\r\ncurrent in a broad part of the river, two miles from the bank along\r\nwhich we were laboriously warping our course upwards.\r\n\r\nAfter the first two or three days we fell into a regular way of life on\r\nboard. Our crew was composed of ten Indians of the Cucáma nation, whose\r\nnative country is a portion of the borders of the upper river in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nauta, in Peru. The Cucámas speak the Tupí language,\r\nusing, however, a harsher accent than is common amongst the\r\nsemi-civilised Indians from Ega downwards. They are a shrewd,\r\nhard-working people, and are the only Indians who willingly, and in a\r\nbody, engage themselves to navigate the canoes of traders. The pilot, a\r\nsteady and faithful fellow named Vicente, told me that he and his\r\ncompanions had now been fifteen months absent from their wives and\r\nfamilies, and that on arriving at Ega they intended to take the first\r\nchance of a passage to Nauta. There was nothing in the appearance of\r\nthese men to distinguish them from canoemen in general. Some were tall\r\nand well built, others had squat figures with broad shoulders and\r\nexcessively thick arms and legs. No two of them were at all similar in\r\nthe shape of the head: Vicente had an oval visage, with fine regular\r\nfeatures, whilst a little dumpy fellow, the wag of the party, was quite\r\na Mongolian in breadth and prominence of cheek, spread of nostrils, and\r\nobliquity of eyes; but these two formed the extremes as to face and\r\nfigure. None of them were tattooed or disfigured in any way and they\r\nwere all quite destitute of beard. The Cucámas are notorious on the\r\nriver for their provident habits. The desire of acquiring property is\r\nso rare a trait in Indians, that the habits of these people are\r\nremarked on with surprise by the Brazilians. The first possession which\r\nthey strive to acquire on descending the river into Brazil, which all\r\nthe Peruvian Indians look upon as a richer country than their own, is a\r\nwooden trunk with lock and key; in this they stow away carefully all\r\ntheir earnings converted into clothing, hatchets, knives, harpoon\r\nheads, needles and thread, and so forth. Their wages are only fourpence\r\nor sixpence a day, which is often paid in goods charged one hundred per\r\ncent above Pará prices, so that it takes them a long time to fill their\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a better-behaved set of men in a voyage\r\nthan these poor Indians. During our thirty-five days’ journey they\r\nlived and worked together in the most perfect good fellowship. I never\r\nheard an angry word pass amongst them. Senhor Estulano let them\r\nnavigate the vessel in their own way, exerting his authority only now\r\nand then when they were inclined to be lazy. Vicente regulated the\r\nworking hours. These depended on the darkness of the nights. In the\r\nfirst and second quarters of the moon they kept it up with _espia_, or\r\noars, until almost midnight; in the third and fourth quarters they were\r\nallowed to go to sleep soon after sunset, and were aroused at three or\r\nfour o’clock in the morning to resume their work. On cool, rainy days\r\nwe all bore a hand at the _espia_, trotting with bare feet on the\r\nsloppy deck in Indian file to the tune of some wild boatman’s chorus.\r\nWe had a favorable wind for only two days out of the thirty-five, by\r\nwhich we made about forty miles, the rest of our long journey was\r\naccomplished literally by pulling our way from tree to tree. When we\r\nencountered a _remanso_ near the shore, we got along very pleasantly\r\nfor a few miles by rowing: but this was a rare occurrence. During\r\nleisure hours the Indians employed themselves in sewing. Vicente was a\r\ngood hand at cutting out shirts and trousers, and acted as master\r\ntailor to the whole party, each of whom had a thick steel thimble and a\r\nstock of needles and thread of his own. Vicente made for me a set of\r\nblue-check cotton shirts during the passage.\r\n\r\nThe goodness of these Indians, like that of most others amongst whom I\r\nlived, consisted perhaps more in the absence of active bad qualities,\r\nthan in the possession of good ones; in other words, it was negative\r\nrather than positive. Their phlegmatic, apathetic temperament, coldness\r\nof desire and deadness of feeling, want of curiosity and slowness of\r\nintellect, make the Amazonian Indians very uninteresting companions\r\nanywhere. Their imagination is of a dull, gloomy, quality and they\r\nseemed never to be stirred by the emotions:—love, pity, admiration,\r\nfear, wonder, joy, or enthusiasm. These are characteristics of the\r\nwhole race. The good fellowship of our Cucámas seemed to arise not from\r\nwarm sympathy, but simply from the absence of eager selfishness in\r\nsmall matters. On the morning when the favourable wind sprung up, one\r\nof the crew, a lad of about seventeen years of age, was absent ashore\r\nat the time of starting, having gone alone in one of the montarias to\r\ngather wild fruit. The sails were spread and we travelled for several\r\nhours at great speed, leaving the poor fellow to paddle after us\r\nagainst the strong current. Vicente, who might have waited a few\r\nminutes at starting, and the others, only laughed when the hardship of\r\ntheir companion was alluded to. He overtook us at night, having worked\r\nhis way with frightful labor the whole day without a morsel of food. He\r\ngrinned when he came on board, and not a dozen words were said on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nTheir want of curiosity is extreme. One day we had an unusually sharp\r\nthunder shower. The crew were lying about the deck, and after each\r\nexplosion all set up a loud laugh; the wag of the party exclaiming:\r\n“There’s my old uncle hunting again!” an expression showing the utter\r\nemptiness of mind of the spokesman. I asked Vicente what he thought was\r\nthe cause of lightning and thunder? He said, “Timaá ichoquá,”—I don’t\r\nknow. He had never given the subject a moment’s thought! It was the\r\nsame with other things. I asked him who made the sun, the stars, the\r\ntrees? He didn’t know, and had never heard the subject mentioned\r\namongst his tribe. The Tupí language, at least as taught by the old\r\nJesuits, has a word—Tupána—signifying God. Vicente sometimes used this\r\nword, but he showed by his expressions that he did not attach the idea\r\nof a Creator to it. He seemed to think it meant some deity or visible\r\nimage which the whites worshipped in the churches he had seen in the\r\nvillages. None of the Indian tribes on the Upper Amazons have an idea\r\nof a Supreme Being, and consequently have no word to express it in\r\ntheir own language. Vicente thought the river on which we were\r\ntravelling encircled the whole earth, and that the land was an island\r\nlike those seen in the stream, but larger. Here a gleam of curiosity\r\nand imagination in the Indian mind is revealed: the necessity of a\r\ntheory of the earth and water has been felt, and a theory has been\r\nsuggested. In all other matters not concerning the common wants of\r\nlife, the mind of Vicente was a blank and such I always found to be the\r\ncase with the Indian in his natural state. Would a community of any\r\nrace of men be otherwise, were they isolated for centuries in a\r\nwilderness like the Amazonian Indians, associated in small numbers\r\nwholly occupied in procuring a mere subsistence, and without a written\r\nlanguage, or a leisured class to hand down acquired knowledge from\r\ngeneration to generation?\r\n\r\nOne day a smart squall gave us a good lift onward; it came with a cold,\r\nfine, driving rain, which enveloped the desolate landscape as with a\r\nmist; the forest swayed and roared with the force of the gale, and\r\nflocks of birds were driven about in alarm over the tree tops. On\r\nanother occasion a similar squall came from an unfavourable quarter; it\r\nfell upon us quite unawares, when we had all our sails out to dry, and\r\nblew us broadside foremost on the shore. The vessel was fairly lifted\r\non to the tall bushes which lined the banks, but we sustained no injury\r\nbeyond the entanglement of our rigging in the branches. The days and\r\nnights usually passed in a dead calm, or with light intermittent winds\r\nfrom up river, and consequently full against us. We landed twice a day\r\nto give ourselves and the Indians a little rest and change, and to cook\r\nour two meals—breakfast and dinner. There was another passenger besides\r\nmyself—a cautious, middle-aged Portuguese, who was going to settle at\r\nEga, where he had a brother long since established. He was accommodated\r\nin the fore-cabin, or arched covering over the hold. I shared the\r\ncabin-proper with Senhores Estulano and Manoel, the latter a young\r\nhalf-caste, son-in-law to the owner of the vessel, under whose tuition\r\nI made good progress in learning the Tupí language during the voyage.\r\n\r\nOur men took it in turns, two at a time, to go out fishing; for which\r\npurpose we carried a spare montaria. The master had brought from Barra\r\nas provision, nothing but stale, salt pirarucú—half rotten fish, in\r\nlarge, thin, rusty slabs—farinha, coffee, and treacle. In these\r\nvoyages, passengers are expected to provide for themselves, as no\r\ncharge is made except for freight of the heavy luggage or cargo they\r\ntake with them. The Portuguese and myself had brought a few luxuries,\r\nsuch as beans, sugar, biscuits, tea, and so forth; but we found\r\nourselves almost obliged to share them with our two companions and the\r\npilot, so that before the voyage was one-third finished, the small\r\nstock of most of these articles was exhausted. In return, we shared in\r\nwhatever the men brought. Sometimes they were quite unsuccessful, for\r\nfish is extremely difficult to procure in the season of high water, on\r\naccount of the lower lands lying between the inlets and infinite chain\r\nof pools and lakes being flooded from the main river, thus increasing\r\ntenfold the area over which the finny population has to range. On most\r\ndays, however, they brought two or three fine fish, and once they\r\nharpooned a manatee, or Vacca marina. On this last-mentioned occasion\r\nwe made quite a holiday; the canoe was stopped for six or seven hours,\r\nand all turned out into the forest to help skin and cook the animal.\r\nThe meat was cut into cubical slabs, and each person skewered a dozen\r\nor so of these on a long stick. Fires were made, and the spits stuck in\r\nthe ground and slanted over the flames to roast. A drizzling rain fell\r\nall the time, and the ground around the fires swarmed with stinging\r\nants, attracted by the entrails and slime which were scattered about.\r\nThe meat has somewhat the taste of very coarse pork; but the fat, which\r\nlies in thick layers between the lean parts, is of a greenish colour,\r\nand of a disagreeable, fishy flavour. The animal was a large one,\r\nmeasuring nearly ten feet in length, and nine in girth at the broadest\r\npart. The manatee is one of the few objects which excite the dull\r\nwonder and curiosity of the Indians, notwithstanding its commonness.\r\nThe fact of its suckling its young at the breast, although an aquatic\r\nanimal resembling a fish, seems to strike them as something very\r\nstrange. The animal, as it lay on its back, with its broad rounded head\r\nand muzzle, tapering body, and smooth, thick, lead-coloured skin\r\nreminded me of those Egyptian tombs which are made of dark, smooth\r\nstone, and shaped to the human figure.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the hard fare, the confinement of the canoe, the trying\r\nweather,—frequent and drenching rains, with gleams of fiery\r\nsunshine,—and the woeful desolation of the river scenery, I enjoyed the\r\nvoyage on the whole. We were not much troubled by mosquitoes, and\r\ntherefore passed the nights very pleasantly, sleeping on deck wrapped\r\nin blankets or old sails. When the rains drove us below we were less\r\ncomfortable, as there was only just room in the small cabin for three\r\nof us to lie close together, and the confined air was stifling. I\r\nbecame inured to the Piums in the course of the first week; all the\r\nexposed parts of my body, by that time, being so closely covered with\r\nblack punctures that the little bloodsuckers could not very easily find\r\nan unoccupied place to operate upon. Poor Miguel, the Portuguese,\r\nsuffered horribly from these pests, his ankles and wrists being so much\r\ninflamed that he was confined to his hammock, slung in the hold, for\r\nweeks. At every landing place I had a ramble in the forest, whilst the\r\nredskins made the fire and cooked the meal. The result was a large\r\ndaily addition to my collection of insects, reptiles, and shells.\r\nSometimes the neighbourhood of our gipsy-like encampment was a tract of\r\ndry and spacious forest, pleasant to ramble in; but more frequently it\r\nwas a rank wilderness, into which it was impossible to penetrate many\r\nyards, on account of uprooted trees, entangled webs of monstrous woody\r\nclimbers, thickets of spiny bamboos, swamps, or obstacles of one kind\r\nor other. The drier lands were sometimes beautified to the highest\r\ndegree by groves of the Urucurí palm (Attalea excelsa), which grew by\r\nthe thousands under the crowns of the lofty, ordinary forest trees;\r\ntheir smooth columnar stems being all of nearly equal height (forty or\r\nfifty feet), and their broad, finely-pinnated leaves interlocking above\r\nto form arches and woven canopies of elegant and diversified shapes.\r\nThe fruit of this palm ripens on the upper river in April, and during\r\nour voyage I saw immense quantities of it strewn about under the trees\r\nin places where we encamped. It is similar in size and shape to the\r\ndate, and has a pleasantly-flavoured juicy pulp. The Indians would not\r\neat it; I was surprised at this, as they greedily devoured many other\r\nkinds of palm fruit whose sour and fibrous pulp was much less\r\npalatable. Vicente shook his head when he saw me one day eating a\r\nquantity of the Urucurí plums. I am not sure they were not the cause of\r\na severe indigestion under which I suffered for many days afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulging-stemmed Palm: Pashiúba barrigudo (Iriartea ventricosa).\r\n\r\nIn passing slowly along the interminable wooded banks week after week,\r\nI observed that there were three tolerably distinct kinds of coast and\r\ncorresponding forest constantly recurring on this upper river. First,\r\nthere were the low and most recent alluvial deposits,—a mixture of sand\r\nand mud, covered with tall, broad-leaved grasses, or with the\r\narrow-grass before described, whose feathery-topped flower-stem rises\r\nto a height of fourteen or fifteen feet. The only large trees which\r\ngrow in these places are the Cecropiæ. Many of the smaller and newer\r\nislands were of this description. Secondly, there were the moderately\r\nhigh banks, which are only partially overflowed when the flood season\r\nis at its height; these are wooded with a magnificent, varied forest,\r\nin which a great variety of palms and broad-leaved Marantaceæ form a\r\nvery large proportion of the vegetation. The general foliage is of a\r\nvivid light-green hue; the water frontage is sometimes covered with a\r\ndiversified mass of greenery; but where the current sets strongly\r\nagainst the friable, earthy banks, which at low water are twenty-five\r\nto thirty feet high, these are cut away, and expose a section of forest\r\nwhere the trunks of trees loaded with epiphytes appear in massy\r\ncolonnades. One might safely say that three-fourths of the land\r\nbordering the Upper Amazons, for a thousand miles, belong to this\r\nsecond class. The third description of coast is the higher, undulating,\r\nclayey land, which appears only at long intervals, but extends\r\nsometimes for many miles along the borders of the river. The coast at\r\nthese places is sloping, and composed of red or variegated clay. The\r\nforest is of a different character from that of the lower tracts: it is\r\nrounder in outline, more uniform in its general aspect; palms are much\r\nless numerous and of peculiar species—the strange bulging-stemmed\r\nspecies, Iriartea ventricosa, and the slender, glossy-leaved Bacába-í\r\n(Œnocarpus minor), being especially characteristic; and, in short,\r\nanimal life, which imparts some cheerfulness to the other parts of the\r\nriver, is seldom apparent. This “terra firme,” as it is called, and a\r\nlarge portion of the fertile lower land, seemed well adapted for\r\nsettlement; some parts were originally peopled by the aborigines, but\r\nthese have long since become extinct or amalgamated with the white\r\nimmigrants. I afterwards learned that there were not more than eighteen\r\nor twenty families settled throughout the whole country from Manacápurú\r\nto Quary, a distance of 240 miles; and these, as before observed, do\r\nnot live on the banks of the main stream, but on the shores of inlets\r\nand lakes.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen twice brought me small rounded pieces of very porous\r\npumice-stone, which they had picked up floating on the surface of the\r\nmain current of the river. They were to me objects of great curiosity\r\nas being messengers from the distant volcanoes of the Andes: Cotopaxi,\r\nLlanganete, or Sangay, which rear their peaks amongst the rivulets that\r\nfeed some of the early tributaries of the Amazons, such as the Macas,\r\nthe Pastaza, and the Napo. The stones must have already travelled a\r\ndistance of 1200 miles. I afterwards found them rather common; the\r\nBrazilians use them for cleaning rust from their guns, and firmly\r\nbelieve them to be solidified river foam. A friend once brought me,\r\nwhen I lived at Santarem, a large piece which had been found in the\r\nmiddle of the stream below Monte Alegre, about 900 miles further down\r\nthe river; having reached this distance, pumice-stones would be pretty\r\nsure of being carried out to sea, and floated thence with the\r\nnorth-westerly Atlantic current to shores many thousand miles distant\r\nfrom the volcanoes which ejected them. They are sometimes stranded on\r\nthe banks in different parts of the river. Reflecting on this\r\ncircumstance since I arrived in England, the probability of these\r\nporous fragments serving as vehicles for the transportation of seeds of\r\nplants, eggs of insects, spawn of fresh-water fish, and so forth, has\r\nsuggested itself to me. Their rounded, water-worn appearance showed\r\nthat they must have been rolled about for a long time in the shallow\r\nstreams near the sources of the rivers at the feet of the volcanoes,\r\nbefore they leapt the waterfalls and embarked on the currents which\r\nlead direct for the Amazons. They may have been originally cast on the\r\nland and afterwards carried to the rivers by freshets; in which case\r\nthe eggs and seeds of land insects and plants might be accidentally\r\nintroduced and safely enclosed with particles of earth in their\r\ncavities. As the speed of the current in the rainy season has been\r\nobserved to be from three to five miles an hour, they might travel an\r\nimmense distance before the eggs or seeds were destroyed. I am ashamed\r\nto say that I neglected the opportunity, whilst on the spot, of\r\nascertaining whether this was actually the case. The attention of\r\nNaturalists has only lately been turned to the important subject of\r\noccasional means of wide dissemination of species of animals and\r\nplants. Unless such be shown to exist, it is impossible to solve some\r\nof the most difficult problems connected with the distribution of\r\nplants and animals. Some species, with most limited powers of\r\nlocomotion, are found in opposite parts of the earth, without existing\r\nin the intermediate regions; unless it can be shown that these may have\r\nmigrated or been accidentally transported from one point to the other,\r\nwe shall have to come to the strange conclusion that the same species\r\nhad been created in two separate districts.\r\n\r\nCanoemen on the Upper Amazons live in constant dread of the “terras\r\ncahidas,” or landslips, which occasionally take place along the steep\r\nearthy banks, especially when the waters are rising. Large vessels are\r\nsometimes overwhelmed by these avalanches of earth and trees. I should\r\nhave thought the accounts of them exaggerated if I had not had an\r\nopportunity during this voyage of seeing one on a large scale. One\r\nmorning I was awakened before sunrise by an unusual sound resembling\r\nthe roar of artillery. I was lying alone on the top of the cabin; it\r\nwas very dark, and all my companions were asleep, so I lay listening.\r\nThe sounds came from a considerable distance, and the crash which had\r\naroused me was succeeded by others much less formidable. The first\r\nexplanation which occurred to me was that it was an earthquake; for,\r\nalthough the night was breathlessly calm, the broad river was much\r\nagitated and the vessel rolled heavily. Soon after, another loud\r\nexplosion took place, apparently much nearer than the former one; then\r\nfollowed others. The thundering peal rolled backwards and forwards, now\r\nseeming close at hand, now far off; the sudden crashes being often\r\nsucceeded by a pause or a long-continued dull rumbling. At the second\r\nexplosion, Vicente, who lay snoring by the helm, awoke and told me it\r\nwas a “terra cahida”; but I could scarcely believe him. The day dawned\r\nafter the uproar had lasted about an hour, and we then saw the work of\r\ndestruction going forward on the other side of the river, about three\r\nmiles off. Large masses of forest, including trees of colossal size,\r\nprobably 200 feet in height, were rocking to and fro, and falling\r\nheadlong one after the other into the water. After each avalanche the\r\nwave which it caused returned on the crumbly bank with tremendous\r\nforce, and caused the fall of other masses by undermining them. The\r\nline of coast over which the landslip extended, was a mile or two in\r\nlength; the end of it, however, was hidden from our view by an\r\nintervening island. It was a grand sight; each downfall created a cloud\r\nof spray; the concussion in one place causing other masses to give way\r\na long distance from it, and thus the crashes continued, swaying to and\r\nfro, with little prospect of a termination. When we glided out of\r\nsight, two hours after sunrise, the destruction was still going on.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd we threaded the Paraná-mirim of Arauána-í, one of the\r\nnumerous narrow bywaters which lie conveniently for canoes away from\r\nthe main river, and often save a considerable circuit around a\r\npromontory or island. We rowed for half a mile through a magnificent\r\nbed of Victoria waterlilies, the flower-buds of which were just\r\nbeginning to expand. Beyond the mouth of the Catuá, a channel leading\r\nto one of the great lakes so numerous in the plains of the Amazons,\r\nwhich we passed on the 25th, the river appeared greatly increased in\r\nbreadth. We travelled for three days along a broad reach which both up\r\nand down river presented a blank horizon of water and sky: this clear\r\nview was owing to the absence of islands, but it renewed one’s\r\nimpressions of the magnitude of the stream, which here, 1200 miles from\r\nits mouth, showed so little diminution of width. Further westward, a\r\nseries of large islands commences, which divides the river into two and\r\nsometimes three channels, each about a mile in breadth. We kept to the\r\nsouthernmost of these, travelling all day on the 30th of April along a\r\nhigh and rather sloping bank.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we arrived at a narrow opening, which would be taken by\r\na stranger navigating the main channel for the cutlet of some\r\ninsignificant stream: it was the mouth of the Teffé, on whose banks Ega\r\nis situated, the termination of our voyage. After having struggled for\r\nthirty-five days with the muddy currents and insect pests of the\r\nSolimoens, it was unspeakably refreshing to find one’s-self again in a\r\ndark-water river, smooth as a lake, and free from Pium and Motúca. The\r\nrounded outline, small foliage, and sombre-green of the woods, which\r\nseemed to rest on the glassy waters, made a pleasant contrast to the\r\ntumultuous piles of rank, glaring, light-green vegetation, and torn,\r\ntimber-strewn banks to which we had been so long accustomed on the main\r\nriver. The men rowed lazily until nightfall, when, having done a\r\nlaborious day’s work, they discontinued and went to sleep, intending to\r\nmake for Ega in the morning. It was not thought worthwhile to secure\r\nthe vessel to the trees or cast anchor, as there was no current. I sat\r\nup for two or three hours after my companions had gone to rest,\r\nenjoying the solemn calm of the night. Not a breath of air stirred; the\r\nsky was of a deep blue, and the stars seemed to stand forth in sharp\r\nrelief; there was no sound of life in the woods, except the occasional\r\nmelancholy note of some nocturnal bird. I reflected on my own wandering\r\nlife; I had now reached the end of the third stage of my journey, and\r\nwas now more than half way across the continent. It was necessary for\r\nme, on many accounts, to find a rich locality for Natural History\r\nexplorations, and settle myself in it for some months or years. Would\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ega turn out to be suitable, and should I, a\r\nsolitary stranger on a strange errand, find a welcome amongst its\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nOur Indians resumed their oars at sunrise the next morning (May 1st),\r\nand after an hour’s rowing along the narrow channel, which varies in\r\nbreadth from 100 to 500 yards, we doubled a low wooded point, and\r\nemerged suddenly on the so-called Lake of Ega: a magnificent sheet of\r\nwater, five miles broad, the expanded portion of the Teffé. It is quite\r\nclear of islands, and curves away to the west and south, so that its\r\nfull extent is not visible from this side. To the left, on a gentle\r\ngrassy slope at the point of junction of a broad tributary with the\r\nTeffé, lay the little settlement: a cluster of a hundred or so of\r\npalm-thatched cottages and white-washed red-tiled houses, each with its\r\nneatly-enclosed orchard of orange, lemon, banana, and guava trees.\r\nGroups of palms, with their tall slender shafts and feathery crowns,\r\novertopped the buildings and lower trees. A broad grass-carpeted street\r\nled from the narrow strip of white sandy beach to the rudely-built\r\nbarn-like church, with its wooden crucifix on the green before it, in\r\nthe centre of the town. Cattle were grazing before the houses, and a\r\nnumber of dark-skinned natives were taking their morning bath amongst\r\nthe canoes of various sizes, which were anchored or moored to stakes in\r\nthe port. We let off rockets and fired salutes, according to custom, in\r\ntoken of our safe arrival, and shortly afterwards went ashore.\r\n\r\nA few days’ experience of the people and the forests of the vicinity\r\nshowed me that I might lay myself out for a long, pleasant, and busy\r\nresidence at this place. An idea of the kind of people I had fallen\r\namongst may be conveyed by an account of my earliest acquaintances in\r\nthe place. On landing, the owner of the canoe killed an ox in honour of\r\nour arrival, and the next day took me round the town to introduce me to\r\nthe principal residents. We first went to the Delegado of police,\r\nSenhor Antonio Cardozo, of whom I shall have to make frequent mention\r\nby-and-by. He was a stout, broad-featured man, ranking as a white, but\r\nhaving a tinge of negro blood, his complexion, however, was ruddy, and\r\nscarcely betrayed the mixture. He received us in a very cordial,\r\nwinning manner; I had afterwards occasion to be astonished at the\r\nboundless good nature of this excellent fellow, whose greatest pleasure\r\nseemed to be to make sacrifices for his friends. He was a Paraense, and\r\ncame to Ega originally as a trader; but, not succeeding in this, he\r\nturned planter on a small scale and collector of the natural\r\ncommodities of the country, employing half-a-dozen Indians in the\r\nbusiness. We then visited the military commandant, an officer in the\r\nBrazilian army, named Praia. He was breakfasting with the Vicar, and we\r\nfound the two in dishabille (morning-gown, loose round the neck, and\r\nslippers), seated at a rude wooden table in an open mud-floored\r\nverandah, at the back of the house. Commander Praia was a little\r\ncurly-headed man (also somewhat of a mulatto), always merry and fond of\r\npractical jokes. His wife, Donna Anna, a dressy dame from Santarem, was\r\nthe leader of fashion in the settlement. The Vicar, Father Luiz\r\nGonsalvo Gomez, was a nearly pure-blood Indian, a native of one of the\r\nneighbouring villages, but educated at Maranham, a city on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. I afterwards saw a good deal of him, as he was an agreeable,\r\nsociable fellow, fond of reading and hearing about foreign countries,\r\nand quite free from the prejudices which might be expected in a man of\r\nhis profession. I found him, moreover, a thoroughly upright, sincere,\r\nand virtuous man. He supported his aged mother and unmarried sisters in\r\na very creditable way out of his small salary and emoluments. It is a\r\npleasure to be able to speak in these terms of a Brazilian priest, for\r\nthe opportunity occurs rarely enough.\r\n\r\nLeaving these agreeable new acquaintances to finish their breakfast, we\r\nnext called on the Director of the Indians of the Japura, Senhor José\r\nChrysostomo Monteiro, a thin wiry Mameluco, the most enterprising\r\nperson in the settlement. Each of the neighbouring rivers with its\r\nnumerous wild tribes is under the control of a Director, who is\r\nnominated by the Imperial Government. There are now no missions in the\r\nregions of the Upper Amazons; the “gentios” (heathens, or unbaptised\r\nIndians) being considered under the management and protection of these\r\ndespots, who, like the captains of Trabalhadores, before mentioned, use\r\nthe natives for their own private ends. Senhor Chrysostomo had, at this\r\ntime, 200 of the Japura Indians in his employ. He was half Indian\r\nhimself, but was a far worse master to the redskins than the whites\r\nusually are. We finished our rounds by paying our respects to a\r\nvenerable native merchant, Senhor Romao de Oliveira, a tall, corpulent,\r\nfine-looking old man, who received us with a naive courtesy quite\r\noriginal in its way. He had been an industrious, enterprising man in\r\nhis younger days, and had built a substantial range of houses and\r\nwarehouses. The shrewd and able old gentleman knew nothing of the world\r\nbeyond the wilderness of the Solimoens and its few thousands of\r\nisolated inhabitants, yet he could converse well and sensibly, making\r\nobservations on men and things as sagaciously as though he had drawn\r\nthem from long experience of life in a European capital. The\r\nsemi-civilised Indians respected old Romao, and he had, consequently, a\r\ngreat number in his employ in different parts of the river: his vessels\r\nwere always filled quicker with produce than those of his neighbours.\r\nOn our leaving, he placed his house and store at my disposal. This was\r\nnot a piece of empty politeness, for some time afterwards, when I\r\nwished to settle for the goods I had had of him, he refused to take any\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nI made Ega my headquarters during the whole of the time I remained on\r\nthe Upper Amazons (four years and a half). My excursions into the\r\nneighbouring region extended sometimes as far as 300 and 400 miles from\r\nthe place. An account of these excursions will be given in subsequent\r\nchapters; in the intervals between them I led a quiet, uneventful life\r\nin the settlement, following my pursuit in the same peaceful, regular\r\nway as a Naturalist might do in a European village. For many weeks in\r\nsuccession my journal records little more than the notes made on my\r\ndaily captures. I had a dry and specious cottage, the principal room of\r\nwhich was made a workshop and study; here a large table was placed, and\r\nmy little library of reference arranged on shelves in rough wooden\r\nboxes. Cages for drying specimens were suspended from the rafters by\r\ncords well anointed, to prevent ants from descending, with a bitter\r\nvegetable oil; rats and mice were kept from them by inverted _ cuyas_,\r\nplaced half way down the cords. I always kept on hand a large portion\r\nof my private collection, which contained a pair of each species and\r\nvariety, for the sake of comparing the old with the new acquisitions.\r\nMy cottage was whitewashed inside and out about once a year by the\r\nproprietor, a native trader; the floor was of earth; the ventilation\r\nwas perfect, for the outside air, and sometimes the rain as well,\r\nentered freely through gaps at the top of the walls under the eaves and\r\nthrough wide crevices in the doorways. Rude as the dwelling was, I look\r\nback with pleasure on the many happy months I spent in it. I rose\r\ngenerally with the sun, when the grassy streets were wet with dew, and\r\nwalked down to the river to bathe; five or six hours of every morning\r\nwere spent in collecting in the forest, whose borders lay only five\r\nminutes’ walk from my house; the hot hours of the afternoon, between\r\nthree and six o’clock, and the rainy days, were occupied in preparing\r\nand ticketing the specimens, making notes, dissecting, and drawing. I\r\nfrequently had short rambles by water in a small montaria, with an\r\nIndian lad to paddle. The neighbourhood yielded me, up to the last day\r\nof my residence, an uninterrupted succession of new and curious forms\r\nin the different classes of the animal kingdom, and especially insects.\r\n\r\nI lived, as may already have been seen, on the best of terms with the\r\ninhabitants of Ega. Refined society, of course, there was none; but the\r\nscore or so of decent quiet families which constituted the upper class\r\nof the place were very sociable; their manners offered a curious\r\nmixture of naive rusticity and formal politeness; the great desire to\r\nbe thought civilised leads the most ignorant of these people (and they\r\nare all very ignorant, although of quick intelligence) to be civil and\r\nkind to strangers from Europe. I was never troubled with that\r\nimpertinent curiosity on the part of the people in these interior\r\nplaces which some travellers complain of in other countries. The\r\nIndians and lower half-castes—at least such of them who gave any\r\nthought to the subject—seemed to think it natural that strangers should\r\ncollect and send abroad the beautiful birds and insects of their\r\ncountry. The butterflies they universally concluded to be wanted as\r\npatterns for bright-coloured calico-prints. As to the better sort of\r\npeople, I had no difficulty in making them understand that each\r\nEuropean capital had a public museum, in which were sought to be stored\r\nspecimens of all natural productions in the mineral, animal, and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. They could not comprehend how a man could study\r\nscience for its own sake; but I told them I was collecting for the\r\n“Museo de Londres,” and was paid for it; _ that_ was very intelligible.\r\nOne day, soon after my arrival, when I was explaining these things to a\r\nlistening circle seated on benches in the grassy street, one of the\r\naudience, a considerable tradesman, a Mameluco native of Ega, got\r\nsuddenly quite enthusiastic, and exclaimed, “How rich are these great\r\nnations of Europe! We half-civilised creatures know nothing. Let us\r\ntreat this stranger well, that he may stay amongst us and teach our\r\nchildren.” We very frequently had social parties, with dancing and so\r\nforth; of these relaxations I shall have more to say presently. The\r\nmanners of the Indian population also gave me some amusement for a long\r\ntime. During the latter part of my residence, three wandering\r\nFrenchmen, and two Italians, some of them men of good education, on\r\ntheir road one after the other from the Andes down the Amazons, became\r\nenamoured of this delightfully situated and tranquil spot, and made up\r\ntheir minds to settle here for the remainder of their lives. Three of\r\nthem ended by marrying native women. I found the society of these\r\nfriends a very agreeable change.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many drawbacks to the amenities of the place as\r\na residence for a European; but these were not of a nature that my\r\nreaders would perhaps imagine. There was scarcely any danger from wild\r\nanimals: it seems almost ridiculous to refute the idea of danger from\r\nthe natives in a country where even incivility to an unoffending\r\nstranger is a rarity. A jaguar, however, paid us a visit one night. It\r\nwas considered an extraordinary event, and so much uproar was made by\r\nthe men who turned out with guns and bows and arrows, that the animal\r\nscampered off and was heard of no more. Alligators were rather\r\ntroublesome in the dry season. During these months there was almost\r\nalways one or two lying in wait near the bathing place for anything\r\nthat might turn up at the edge of the water; dog, sheep, pig, child, or\r\ndrunken Indian. When this visitor was about every one took extra care\r\nwhilst bathing. I used to imitate the natives in not advancing far from\r\nthe bank, and in keeping my eye fixed on that of the monster, which\r\nstares with a disgusting leer along the surface of the water; the body\r\nbeing submerged to the level of the eyes, and the top of the head, with\r\npart of the dorsal crest the only portions visible. When a little\r\nmotion was perceived in the water behind the reptile’s tail, bathers\r\nwere obliged to beat a quick retreat. I was never threatened myself,\r\nbut I often saw the crowds of women and children scared whilst bathing\r\nby the beast making a movement towards them; a general scamper to the\r\nshore and peals of laughter were always the result in these cases. The\r\nmen can always destroy these alligators when they like to take the\r\ntrouble to set out with montarias and harpoons for the purpose; but\r\nthey never do it unless one of the monsters, bolder than usual, puts\r\nsome one’s life in danger. This arouses them, and they then track the\r\nenemy with the greatest pertinacity; when half-killed, they drag it\r\nashore and dispatch it amid loud execrations. Another, however, is sure\r\nto appear some days or weeks afterwards and take the vacant place on\r\nthe station. Besides alligators, the only animals to be feared are the\r\npoisonous serpents. These are certainly common enough in the forest,\r\nbut no fatal accident happened during the whole time of my residence.\r\n\r\nI suffered most inconvenience from the difficulty of getting news from\r\nthe civilised world down river, from the irregularity of receipt of\r\nletters, parcels of books and periodicals, and towards the latter part\r\nof my residence from ill health arising from bad and insufficient food.\r\nThe want of intellectual society, and of the varied excitement of\r\nEuropean life, was also felt most acutely, and this, instead of\r\nbecoming deadened by time, increased until it became almost\r\ninsupportable. I was obliged, at last, to come to the conclusion that\r\nthe contemplation of Nature alone is not sufficient to fill the human\r\nheart and mind. I got on pretty well when I received a parcel from\r\nEngland by the steamer, once in two or four months. I used to be very\r\neconomical with my stock of reading lest it should be finished before\r\nthe next arrival, and leave me utterly destitute. I went over the\r\nperiodicals, the _Athenæum_, for instance, with great deliberation,\r\ngoing through every number three times; the first time devouring the\r\nmore interesting articles; the second, the whole of the remainder; and\r\nthe third, reading all the advertisements from beginning to end. If\r\nfour months (two steamers) passed without a fresh parcel, I felt\r\ndiscouraged in the extreme. I was worst off in the first year, 1850,\r\nwhen twelve months elapsed without letters or remittances. Towards the\r\nend of this time my clothes had worn to rags; I was barefoot, a great\r\ninconvenience in tropical forests, notwithstanding statements to the\r\ncontrary that have been published by travellers; my servant ran away,\r\nand I was robbed of nearly all my copper money. I was obliged then to\r\ndescend to Pará, but returned, after finishing the examination of the\r\nmiddle part of the Lower Amazons and the Tapajos, in 1855, with my\r\nSantarem assistant and better provided for making collections on the\r\nupper river. This second visit was in pursuit of the plan before\r\nmentioned, of exploring in detail the whole valley of the Amazons,\r\nwhich I formed in Pará in the year 1851.\r\n\r\nDuring so long a residence I witnessed, of course, many changes in the\r\nplace. Some of the good friends who made me welcome on my first\r\narrival, died, and I followed their remains to their last resting-place\r\nin the little rustic cemetery on the borders of the surrounding forest.\r\nI lived there long enough, from first to last, to see the young people\r\ngrow up, attended their weddings, and the christenings of their\r\nchildren, and, before I left, saw them old married folks with numerous\r\nfamilies. In 1850 Ega was only a village, dependent on Pará 1400 miles\r\ndistant, as the capital of the then undivided province. In 1852, with\r\nthe creation of the new province of the Amazons, it became a city;\r\nreturned its members to the provincial parliament at Barra; had it\r\nassizes, its resident judges, and rose to be the chief town of the _\r\ncomarca_ or county. A year after this, namely, in 1853, steamers were\r\nintroduced on the Solimoens; and from 1855, one ran regularly every two\r\nmonths between the Rio Negro and Nauta in Peru, touching at all the\r\nvillages, and accomplishing the distance in ascending, about 1200\r\nmiles, in eighteen days. The trade and population, however, did not\r\nincrease with these changes. The people became more “civilised,” that\r\nis, they began to dress according to the latest Parisian fashions,\r\ninstead of going about in stockingless feet, wooden clogs, and shirt\r\nsleeves, acquired a taste for money-getting and office-holding; became\r\ndivided into parties, and lost part of their former simplicity of\r\nmanners. But the place remained, when I left it in 1859, pretty nearly\r\nwhat it was when I first arrived in 1850—a semi-Indian village, with\r\nmuch in the ways and notions of its people more like those of a small\r\ncountry town in Northern Europe than a South American settlement. The\r\nplace is healthy, and almost free from insect pests: perpetual verdure\r\nsurrounds it; the soil is of marvellous fertility, even for Brazil; the\r\nendless rivers and labyrinths of channels teem with fish and turtle, a\r\nfleet of steamers might anchor at any season of the year in the lake,\r\nwhich has uninterrupted water communication straight to the Atlantic.\r\nWhat a future is in store for the sleepy little tropical village!\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of Ega as a city, it will have a ludicrous effect to\r\nmention that the total number of its inhabitants is only about 1200. It\r\ncontains just 107 houses, about half of which are miserably built\r\nmud-walled cottages, thatched with palm-leaves. A fourth of the\r\npopulation are almost always absent, trading or collecting produce on\r\nthe rivers. The neighbourhood within a radius of thirty miles, and\r\nincluding two other small villages, contains probably 2000 more people.\r\nThe settlement is one of the oldest in the country, having been founded\r\nin 1688 by Father Samuel Fritz, a Bohemian Jesuit, who induced several\r\nof the docile tribes of Indians, then scattered over the neighbouring\r\nregion, to settle on the site. From 100 to 200 acres of sloping ground\r\naround the place were afterwards cleared of timber; but such is the\r\nencroaching vigour of vegetation in this country that the site would\r\nquickly relapse into jungle if the inhabitants neglected to pull up the\r\nyoung shoots as they arose. There is a stringent municipal law which\r\ncompels each resident to weed a given space around his dwelling. Every\r\nmonth, whilst I resided here, an inspector came round with his wand of\r\nauthority, and fined every one who had not complied with the\r\nregulation. The Indians of the surrounding country have never been\r\nhostile to the European settlers. The rebels of Pará and the Lower\r\nAmazons, in 1835-6, did not succeed in rousing the natives of the\r\nSolimoens against the whites. A party of forty of them ascended the\r\nriver for that purpose, but on arriving at Ega, instead of meeting with\r\nsympathisers as in other places, they were surrounded by a small body\r\nof armed residents, and shot down without mercy. The military\r\ncommandant at the time, who was the prime mover in this orderly\r\nresistance to anarchy, was a courageous and loyal negro, named José\r\nPatricio, an officer known throughout the Upper Amazons for his\r\nunflinching honesty and love of order, whose acquaintance I had the\r\npleasure of making at St. Paulo in 1858. Ega was the headquarters of\r\nthe great scientific commission, which met in the years from 1781 to\r\n1791 to settle the boundaries between the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nterritories in South America. The chief commissioner for Spain, Don\r\nFrancisco Requena, lived some time in the village with his family. I\r\nfound only one person at Ega, my old friend Romao de Oliveira, who\r\nrecollected, or had any knowledge of this important time, when a\r\nnumerous staff of astronomers, surveyors, and draughtsmen, explored\r\nmuch of the surrounding country with large bodies of soldiers and\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nMore than half the inhabitants of Ega are Mamelucos; there are not more\r\nthan forty or fifty pure whites; the number of negroes and mulattos is\r\nprobably a little less, and the rest of the population consists of pure\r\nblood Indians. Every householder, including Indians and free negroes,\r\nis entitled to a vote in the elections, municipal, provincial, and\r\nimperial, and is liable to be called on juries, and to serve in the\r\nnational guard. These privileges and duties of citizenship do not seem\r\nat present to be appreciated by the more ignorant coloured people.\r\nThere is, however, a gradual improvement taking place in this respect.\r\nBefore I left there was a rather sharp contest for the Presidency of\r\nthe Municipal Chamber, and most of the voters took a lively interest in\r\nit. There was also an election of members to represent the province in\r\nthe Imperial Parliament at Rio Janeiro, in which each party strove hard\r\nto return its candidate. On this occasion, an unscrupulous lawyer was\r\nsent by the government party from the capital to overawe the opposition\r\nto its nominee; many of the half-castes, headed by my old friend John\r\nda Cunha, who was then settled at Ega, fought hard, but with perfect\r\nlegality and good humour, against this powerful interest. They did not\r\nsucceed; and although the government agent committed many tyrannical\r\nand illegal acts, the losing party submitted quietly to their defeat.\r\nIn a larger town, I believe, the government would not have dared to\r\nattempt thus to control the elections. I think I saw enough to warrant\r\nthe conclusion that the machinery of constitutional government would,\r\nwith a little longer trial, work well amongst the mixed Indian, white,\r\nand negro population, even in this remote part of the Brazilian empire.\r\nI attended also, before I left, several assize meetings at Ega, and\r\nwitnessed the novel sight of negro, white, half-caste, and Indian,\r\nsitting gravely side by side on the jury bench.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the coloured races act under the conditions of free\r\ncitizenship is a very interesting subject. Brazilian statesmen seem to\r\nhave abandoned the idea, if they ever entertained it, of making this\r\ntropical empire a nation of whites with a slave labouring class. The\r\ngreatest difficulty on the Amazons is with the Indians. The general\r\ninflexibility of character of the race, and their abhorrence of the\r\nrestraints of civilised life, make them very intractable subjects. Some\r\nof them, however, who have learned to read and write, and whose dislike\r\nto live in towns has been overcome by some cause acting early in life,\r\nmake very good citizens. I have already mentioned the priest, who is a\r\ngood example of what early training can do. There can be no doubt that\r\nif the docile Amazonian Indians were kindly treated by their white\r\nfellow-citizens, and educated, they would not be so quick as they have\r\nhitherto shown themselves to be to leave the towns and return into\r\ntheir half wild condition on the advancing civilisation of the places.\r\nThe inflexibility of character, although probably organic, is seen to\r\nbe sometimes overcome. The principal blacksmith of Ega, Senhor Macedo,\r\nwas also an Indian, and a very sensible fellow. He sometimes filled\r\nminor offices in the government of the place. He used to come very\r\nfrequently to my house to chat, and was always striving to acquire\r\nsolid information about things. When Donati’s comet appeared, he took a\r\ngreat interest in it. We saw it at its best from the 3rd to the 10th of\r\nOctober (1858), between which dates it was visible near the western\r\nhorizon just after sunset, the tail extending in a broad curve towards\r\nthe north, and forming a sublime object. Macedo consulted all the old\r\nalmanacs in the place to ascertain whether it was the same comet as\r\nthat of 1811, which he said he well remembered. Before the Indians can\r\nbe reclaimed in large numbers, it is most likely they will become\r\nextinct as a race; but there is less difficulty with regard to the\r\nMamelucos, who, even when the proportion of white blood is small,\r\nsometimes become enterprising and versatile people.\r\n\r\nMany of the Ega Indians, including all the domestic servants, are\r\nsavages who have been brought from the neighbouring rivers; the Japurá,\r\nthe Issá, and the Solimoens. I saw here individuals of at least sixteen\r\ndifferent tribes, most of whom had been bought, when children, of the\r\nnative chiefs. This species of slave-dealing, although forbidden by the\r\nlaws of Brazil, is winked at by the authorities, because without it,\r\nthere would be no means of obtaining servants. They all become their\r\nown masters when they grow up, and never show the slightest inclination\r\nto return to utter savage life. But the boys generally run away and\r\nembark on the canoes of traders; and the girls are often badly treated\r\nby their mistresses; the jealous, passionate, and ill-educated\r\nBrazilian women. Nearly all the enmities which arise amongst residents\r\nat Ega and other place, are caused by disputes about Indian servants.\r\nNo one who has lived only in old settled countries, where service can\r\nbe readily bought, can imagine the difficulties and annoyances of a\r\nland where the servant class are ignorant of the value of money, and\r\nhands cannot be obtained except by coaxing them from the employ of\r\nother masters.\r\n\r\nGreat mortality takes place amongst the poor captive children on their\r\narrival at Ega. It is a singular circumstance that the Indians residing\r\non the Japura and other tributaries always fall ill on descending to\r\nthe Solimoens, whilst the reverse takes place with the inhabitants of\r\nthe banks of the main river, who never fail of taking intermittent\r\nfever when they first ascend these branch rivers, and of getting well\r\nwhen they return. The finest tribes of savages who inhabit the country\r\nnear Ega are the Jurís and Passés: these are now, however, nearly\r\nextinct, a few families only remaining on the banks of the retired\r\ncreeks connected with the Teffé, and on other branch rivers between the\r\nTeffé and the Jutahí. They are a peaceable, gentle, and industrious\r\npeople, devoted to agriculture and fishing, and have always been\r\nfriendly to the whites. I shall have occasion to speak again of the\r\nPassés, who are a slenderly-built and superior race of Indians,\r\ndistinguished by a large, square tattooed patch in the middle of their\r\nfaces. The principal cause of their decay in numbers seems to be a\r\ndisease which always appears amongst them when a village is visited by\r\npeople from the civilised settlements—a slow fever, accompanied by the\r\nsymptoms of a common cold, “defluxo,” as the Brazilians term it, ending\r\nprobably in consumption. The disorder has been known to break out when\r\nthe visitors were entirely free from it; the simple contact of\r\ncivilised men, in some mysterious way, being sufficient to create it.\r\nIt is generally fatal to the Jurís and Passés; the first question the\r\npoor, patient Indians now put to an advancing canoe is, “Do you bring\r\ndefluxo?”\r\n\r\nMy assistant, José, in the last year of our residence at Ega,\r\n“resgatou” (ransomed, the euphemism in use for purchased) two Indian\r\nchildren, a boy and a girl, through a Japurá trader. The boy was about\r\ntwelve years of age, and of an unusually dark colour of skin: he had,\r\nin fact, the tint of a Cafuzo, the offspring of Indian and negro. It\r\nwas thought he had belonged to some perfectly wild and houseless tribe,\r\nsimilar to the Parárauátes of the Tapajos, of which there are several\r\nin different parts of the interior of South America. His face was of\r\nregular, oval shape, but his glistening black eyes had a wary,\r\ndistrustful expression, like that of a wild animal; his hands and feet\r\nwere small and delicately formed. Soon after his arrival, finding that\r\nnone of the Indian boys and girls in the houses of our neighbours\r\nunderstood his language, he became sulky and reserved; not a word could\r\nbe got from him until many weeks afterwards, when he suddenly broke out\r\nwith complete phrases of Portuguese. He was ill of swollen liver and\r\nspleen, the result of intermittent fever, for a long time after coming\r\ninto our hands. We found it difficult to cure him, owing to his almost\r\ninvincible habit of eating earth, baked clay, pitch, wax, and other\r\nsimilar substances. Very many children on the upper parts of the\r\nAmazons have this strange habit; not only Indians, but negroes and\r\nwhites. It is not, therefore, peculiar to the famous Otomacs of the\r\nOrinoco, described by Humboldt, or to Indians at all, and seems to\r\noriginate in a morbid craving, the result of a meagre diet of fish,\r\nwild-fruits, and mandioca-meal. We gave our little savage the name of\r\nSebastian. The use of these Indian children is to fill water-jars from\r\nthe river, gather firewood in the forest, cook, assist in paddling the\r\nmontaria in excursions, and so forth. Sebastian was often my companion\r\nin the woods, where he was very useful in finding the small birds I\r\nshot, which sometimes fell in the thickets amongst confused masses of\r\nfallen branches and dead leaves. He was wonderfully expert at catching\r\nlizards with his hands, and at climbing. The smoothest stems of\r\npalm-trees offered little difficulty to him; he would gather a few\r\nlengths of tough, flexible lianas, tie them in a short, endless band to\r\nsupport his feet with, in embracing the slippery shaft, and then mount\r\nupwards by a succession of slight jerks. It was very amusing, during\r\nthe first few weeks, to witness the glee and pride with which he would\r\nbring to me the bunches of fruit he had gathered from almost\r\ninaccessible trees. He avoided the company of boys of his own race, and\r\nwas evidently proud of being the servant of a real white man. We\r\nbrought him down with us to Pará, but he showed no emotion at any of\r\nthe strange sights of the capital; the steam-vessels, large ships and\r\nhouses, horses and carriages, the pomp of church ceremonies, and so\r\nforth. In this he exhibited the usual dullness of feeling and poverty\r\nof thought of the Indian; he had, nevertheless, very keen perceptions,\r\nand was quick at learning any mechanical art. José, who had resumed,\r\nsome time before I left the country, his old trade of goldsmith, made\r\nhim his apprentice, and he made very rapid progress; for after about\r\nthree months’ teaching he came to me one day with radiant countenance\r\nand showed me a gold ring of his own making.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the little girl, who came with a second batch of children\r\nall ill of intermittent fever, a month or two after Sebastian, was very\r\ndifferent. She was brought to our house, after landing, one night in\r\nthe wet season, when the rain was pouring in torrents, thin and\r\nhaggard, drenched with wet and shivering with ague. An old Indian who\r\nbrought her to the door said briefly, “ecui encommenda” (here’s your\r\nlittle parcel, or order), and went away. There was very little of the\r\nsavage in her appearance, and she was of a much lighter colour than the\r\nboy. We found she was of the Miránha tribe, all of whom are\r\ndistinguished by a slit, cut in the middle of each wing of the nose, in\r\nwhich they wear on holiday occasions a large button made of pearly\r\nriver-shell. We took the greatest care of our little patient; had the\r\nbest nurses in the town, fomented her daily, gave her quinine and the\r\nmost nourishing food; but it was all of no avail, she sank rapidly; her\r\nliver was enormously swollen, and almost as hard to the touch as stone.\r\nThere was something uncommonly pleasing in her ways, and quite unlike\r\nanything I had yet seen in Indians. Instead of being dull and taciturn,\r\nshe was always smiling and full of talk. We had an old woman of the\r\nsame tribe to attend her, who explained what she said to us. She often\r\nbegged to be taken to the river to bathe; asked for fruit, or coveted\r\narticles she saw in the room for playthings. Her native name was Oria.\r\nThe last week or two she could not rise from the bed we had made for\r\nher in a dry corner of the room; when she wanted lifting, which, was\r\nvery often, she would allow no one to help her but me, calling me by\r\nthe name of “Caríwa” (white man), the only word of Tupí she seemed to\r\nknow. It was inexpressibly touching to hear her, as she lay, repeating\r\nby the hour the verses which she had been taught to recite with her\r\ncompanions in her native village: a few sentences repeated over and\r\nover again with a rhythmic accent, and relating to objects and\r\nincidents connected with the wild life of her tribe. We had her\r\nbaptised before she died, and when this latter event happened, in\r\nopposition to the wishes of the big people of Ega, I insisted on\r\nburying her with the same honours as a child of the whites; that is, as\r\nan “anjinho” (little angel), according to the pretty Roman Catholic\r\ncustom of the country. We had the corpse clothed in a robe of fine\r\ncalico, crossed her hands on her breast over a “palma” of flowers, and\r\nmade also a crown of flowers for her head. Scores of helpless children\r\nlike our poor Oria die at Ega, or on the road; but generally not the\r\nslightest care is taken of them during their illness. They are the\r\ncaptives made during the merciless raids of one section of the Miránha\r\ntribe on the territories of another, and sold to the Ega traders. The\r\nvillages of the attacked hordes are surprised, and the men and women\r\nkilled or driven into the thickets without having time to save their\r\nchildren. There appears to be no doubt that the Miránhas are cannibals,\r\nand, therefore, the purchase of these captives probably saves them from\r\na worse fate. The demand for them at Ega operates, however, as a direct\r\ncause of the supply, stimulating the unscrupulous chiefs, who receive\r\nall the profits, to undertake these murderous expeditions.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how quickly the savages of the various nations, which\r\neach have their own, to all appearance, widely different language,\r\nlearn Tupí on their arrival at Ega, where it is the common idiom. This\r\nperhaps may be attributed chiefly to the grammatical forms of all the\r\nIndian tongues being the same, although the words are different. As far\r\nas I could learn, the feature is common to all, of placing the\r\npreposition _after_ the noun, making it, in fact, a _post_-position,\r\nthus: “He is come the village _from_;” “Go him _ with_, the plantation\r\n_to_,” and so forth. The ideas to be expressed in their limited sphere\r\nof life and thought are few; consequently the stock of words is\r\nextremely small; besides, all Indians have the same way of thinking,\r\nand the same objects to talk about; these circumstances also contribute\r\nto the case with which they learn each other’s language. Hordes of the\r\nsame tribe living on the same branch rivers, speak mutually\r\nunintelligible languages; this happens with the Miránhas on the Japurá,\r\nand with the Collínas on the Jurúa; whilst Tupí is spoken with little\r\ncorruption along the banks of the main Amazons for a distance Of 2500\r\nmiles. The purity of Tupí is kept up by frequent communication amongst\r\nthe natives, from one end to the other of the main river; how complete\r\nand long-continued must be the isolation in which the small groups of\r\nsavages have lived in other parts, to have caused so complete a\r\nsegregation of dialects! It is probable that the strange inflexibility\r\nof the Indian organisation, both bodily and mental, is owing to the\r\nisolation in which each small tribe has lived, and to the narrow round\r\nof life and thought, and close intermarriages for countless generations\r\nwhich are the necessary results. Their fecundity is of a low degree,\r\nfor it is very rare to find an Indian family having so many as four\r\nchildren, and we have seen how great is their liability to sickness and\r\ndeath on removal from place to place.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked on the different way in which the climate of\r\nthis equatorial region affects Indians and negroes. No one could live\r\nlong amongst the Indians of the Upper Amazons without being struck with\r\ntheir constitutional dislike to the heat. Europeans certainly withstand\r\nthe high temperature better than the original inhabitants of the\r\ncountry; I always found I could myself bear exposure to the sun or\r\nunusually hot weather quite as well as the Indians, although not\r\nwell-fitted by nature for a hot climate. Their skin is always hot to\r\nthe touch, and they perspire little. No Indian resident of Ega can be\r\ninduced to stay in the village (where the heat is felt more than in the\r\nforest or on the river), for many days together. They bathe many times\r\na day, but do not plunge in the water, taking merely a _sitz-bath_, as\r\ndogs may be seen doing in hot climates, to cool the lower parts of the\r\nbody. The women and children, who often remain at home, whilst the men\r\nare out for many days together fishing, generally find some excuse for\r\ntrooping off to the shades of the forest in the hot hours of the\r\nafternoons. They are restless and discontented in fine dry weather, but\r\ncheerful in cool days, when the rain is pouring down on their naked\r\nbacks. When suffering under fever, nothing but strict watching can\r\nprevent them from going down to bathe in the river, or eating\r\nimmoderate quantities of juicy fruits, although these indulgences are\r\nfrequently the cause of death. They are very subject to disorders of\r\nthe liver, dysentery, and other diseases of hot climates, and when any\r\nepidemic is about, they fall ill quicker, and suffer more than negroes\r\nor even whites. How different all this is with the negro, the true\r\nchild of tropical climes! The impression gradually forced itself on my\r\nmind that the red Indian lives as a stranger, or immigrant in these hot\r\nregions, and that his constitution was not originally adapted, and has\r\nnot since become perfectly adapted, to the climate.\r\n\r\nThe Indian element is very prominent in the amusements of the Ega\r\npeople. All the Roman Catholic holidays are kept up with great spirit;\r\nrude Indian sports being mingled with the ceremonies introduced by the\r\nPortuguese. Besides these, the aborigines celebrate their own ruder\r\nfestivals; the people of different tribes combining; for, in most of\r\ntheir features, the merry-makings were originally alike in all the\r\ntribes. The Indian idea of a holiday is bonfires, processions,\r\nmasquerading, especially the mimicry of different kinds of animals,\r\nplenty of confused drumming and fifing, monotonous dancing, kept up\r\nhour after hour without intermission, and, the most important point of\r\nall, getting gradually and completely drunk. But he attaches a kind of\r\nsuperstitious significance to these acts, and thinks that the\r\namusements appended to the Roman Catholic holidays as celebrated by the\r\ndescendants of the Portuguese, are also an essential part of the\r\nreligious ceremonies. But in this respect, the uneducated whites and\r\nhalf-breeds are not a bit more enlightened than the poor, dull-souled\r\nIndian. All look upon a religious holiday as an amusement, in which the\r\npriest takes the part of director or chief actor.\r\n\r\nAlmost every unusual event, independent of saints’ days, is made the\r\noccasion of a holiday by the sociable, easy-going people of the white\r\nand Mameluco classes; funerals, christenings, weddings, the arrival of\r\nstrangers, and so forth. The custom of “waking” the dead is also kept\r\nup. A few days after I arrived, I was awoke in the middle of a dark\r\nmoist night by Cardozo, to sit up with a neighbour whose wife had just\r\ndied. I found the body laid out on a table, with crucifix and lighted\r\nwax-candles at the head, and the room full of women and girls squatted\r\non stools or on their haunches. The men were seated round the open\r\ndoor, smoking, drinking coffee, and telling stories, the bereaved\r\nhusband exerting himself much to keep the people merry during the\r\nremainder of the night. The Ega people seem to like an excuse for\r\nturning night into day; it is so cool and pleasant, and they can sit\r\nabout during these hours in the open air, clad as usual in simple shirt\r\nand trousers, without streaming with perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe patron saint is Santa Theresa, the festival at whose anniversary\r\nlasts, like most of the others, ten days. It begins very quietly with\r\nevening litanies sung in the church, which are attended by the greater\r\npart of the population, all clean and gaily dressed in calicos and\r\nmuslins; the girls wearing jasmines and other natural flowers in their\r\nhair, no other headdress being worn by females of any class. The\r\nevenings pass pleasantly; the church is lighted up with wax candles,\r\nand illuminated on the outside by a great number of little oil\r\nlamps—rude clay cups, or halves of the thick rind of the bitter orange,\r\nwhich are fixed all over the front. The congregation seem very\r\nattentive, and the responses to the litany of Our Lady, sung by a\r\ncouple of hundred fresh female voices, ring agreeably through the still\r\nvillage. Towards the end of the festival the fun commences. The\r\nmanagers of the feast keep open houses, and dancing, drumming, tinkling\r\nof wire guitars, and unbridled drinking by both sexes, old and young,\r\nare kept up for a couple of days and a night with little intermission.\r\nThe ways of the people at these merry-makings, of which there are many\r\nin the course of the year, always struck me as being not greatly\r\ndifferent from those seen at an old-fashioned village wake in retired\r\nparts of England. The old folks look on and get very talkative over\r\ntheir cups; the children are allowed a little extra indulgence in\r\nsitting up; the dull, reserved fellows become loquacious, shake one\r\nanother by the hand or slap each other on the back, discovering, all at\r\nonce, what capital friends they are. The cantankerous individual gets\r\nquarrelsome, and the amorous unusually loving. The Indian, ordinarily\r\nso taciturn, finds the use of his tongue, and gives the minutest\r\ndetails of some little dispute which he had with his master years ago,\r\nand which everyone else had forgotten; just as I have known lumpish\r\nlabouring men in England do, when half-fuddled. One cannot help\r\nreflecting, when witnessing these traits of manners, on the similarity\r\nof human nature everywhere, when classes are compared whose state of\r\nculture and conditions of life are pretty nearly the same.\r\n\r\nThe Indians play a conspicuous part in the amusements at St. John’s\r\neve, and at one or two other holidays which happen about that time of\r\nthe year—the end of June. In some of the sports the Portuguese element\r\nis visible, in others the Indian, but it must be recollected that\r\nmasquerading, recitative singing, and so forth, are common originally\r\nto both peoples. A large number of men and boys disguise themselves to\r\nrepresent different grotesque figures, animals, or persons. Two or\r\nthree dress themselves up as giants, with the help of a tall framework.\r\nOne enacts the part of the Caypór, a kind of sylvan deity similar to\r\nthe Curupíra which I have before mentioned. The belief in this being\r\nseems to be common to all the tribes of the Tupí stock. According to\r\nthe figure they dressed up at Ega, he is a bulky, misshapen monster,\r\nwith red skin and long shaggy red hair hanging half way down his back.\r\nThey believe that he has subterranean campos and hunting grounds in the\r\nforest, well stocked with pacas and deer. He is not at all an object of\r\nworship nor of fear, except to children, being considered merely as a\r\nkind of hobgoblin. Most of the masquers make themselves up as\r\nanimals—bulls, deer, magoary storks, jaguars, and so forth, with the\r\naid of light frameworks, covered with old cloth dyed or painted and\r\nshaped according to the object represented. Some of the imitations\r\nwhich I saw were capital. One ingenious fellow arranged an old piece of\r\ncanvas in the form of a tapir, placed himself under it, and crawled\r\nabout on all fours. He constructed an elastic nose to resemble that of\r\nthe tapir, and made, before the doors of the principal residents, such\r\na good imitation of the beast grazing, that peals of laughter greeted\r\nhim wherever he went. Another man walked about solitarily, masked as a\r\njabiru crane (a large animal standing about four feet high), and\r\nmimicked the gait and habits of the bird uncommonly well. One year an\r\nIndian lad imitated me, to the infinite amusement of the townsfolk. He\r\ncame the previous day to borrow of me an old blouse and straw hat. I\r\nfelt rather taken in when I saw him, on the night of the performance,\r\nrigged out as an entomologist, with an insect net, hunting bag, and\r\npincushion. To make the imitation complete, he had borrowed the frame\r\nof an old pair of spectacles, and went about with it straddled over his\r\nnose. The jaguar now and then made a raid amongst the crowd of boys who\r\nwere dressed as deer, goats, and so forth. The masquers kept generally\r\ntogether, moving from house to house, and the performances were\r\ndirected by an old musician, who sang the orders and explained to the\r\nspectators what was going forward in a kind of recitative, accompanying\r\nhimself on a wire guitar. The mixture of Portuguese and Indian customs\r\nis partly owing to the European immigrants in these parts having been\r\nuneducated men, who, instead of introducing European civilisation, have\r\ndescended almost to the level of the Indians, and adopted some of their\r\npractices. The performances take place in the evening, and occupy five\r\nor six hours; bonfires are lighted along the grassy streets, and the\r\nfamilies of the better class are seated at their doors, enjoying the\r\nwild but good-humoured fun.\r\n\r\nWe lived at Ega, during most part of the year, on turtle. The great\r\nfresh-water turtle of the Amazons grows on the upper river to an\r\nimmense size, a full-grown one measuring nearly three feet in length by\r\ntwo in breadth, and is a load for the strongest Indian. Every house has\r\na little pond, called a curral (pen), in the backyard to hold a stock\r\nof the animals through the season of dearth—the wet months; those who\r\nhave a number of Indians in their employ send them out for a month when\r\nthe waters are low, to collect a stock, and those who have not,\r\npurchasing their supply; with some difficulty, however, as they are\r\nrarely offered for sale. The price of turtles, like that of all other\r\narticles of food, has risen greatly with the introduction of\r\nsteam-vessels. When I arrived in 1850, a middle-sized one could be\r\nbought pretty readily for ninepence, but when I left in 1859, they were\r\nwith difficulty obtained at eight and nine shillings each. The\r\nabundance of turtles, or rather the facility with which they can be\r\nfound and caught, varies with the amount of annual subsidence of the\r\nwaters. When the river sinks less than the average, they are scarce;\r\nbut when more, they can be caught in plenty, the bays and shallow\r\nlagoons in the forest having then only a small depth of water. The\r\nflesh is very tender, palatable, and wholesome; but it is very cloying:\r\nevery one ends, sooner or later, by becoming thoroughly surfeited. I\r\nbecame so sick of turtle in the course of two years that I could not\r\nbear the smell of it, although at the same time nothing else was to be\r\nhad, and I was suffering actual hunger. The native women cook it in\r\nvarious ways. The entrails are chopped up and made into a delicious\r\nsoup called _sarapatel_, which is generally boiled in the concave upper\r\nshell of the animal used as a kettle. The tender flesh of the breast is\r\npartially minced with farinha, and the breast shell then roasted over\r\nthe fire, making a very pleasant dish. Steaks cut from the breast and\r\ncooked with the fat form another palatable dish. Large sausages are\r\nmade of the thick-coated stomach, which is filled with minced meat and\r\nboiled. The quarters cooked in a kettle of Tucupí sauce form another\r\nvariety of food. When surfeited with turtle in all other shapes, pieces\r\nof the lean part roasted on a spit and moistened only with vinegar make\r\nan agreeable change. The smaller kind of turtle, the tracaja, which\r\nmakes its appearance in the main river, and lays its eggs a month\r\nearlier than the large species, is of less utility to the inhabitants\r\nalthough its flesh is superior, on account of the difficulty of keeping\r\nit alive; it survives captivity but a very few days, although placed in\r\nthe same ponds in which the large turtle keeps well for two or three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThose who cannot hunt and fish for themselves, and whose stomachs\r\nrefuse turtle, are in a poor way at Ega. Fish, including many kinds of\r\nlarge and delicious salmonidæ, is abundant in the fine season; but each\r\nfamily fishes only for itself, and has no surplus for sale. An Indian\r\nfisherman remains out just long enough to draw what he thinks\r\nsufficient for a couple of days’ consumption. Vacca marina is a great\r\nresource in the wet season. It is caught by harpooning, which requires\r\nmuch skill, or by strong nets made of very thick hammock twine, and\r\nplaced across narrow inlets. Very few Europeans are able to eat the\r\nmeat of this animal. Although there is a large quantity of cattle in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the town, and pasture is abundant all the year\r\nround, beef can be had only when a beast is killed by accident. The\r\nmost frequent cause of death is poisoning by drinking raw Tucupí, the\r\njuice of the mandioca root. Bowls of this are placed on the ground in\r\nthe sheds where the women prepare farinha; it is generally done\r\ncarelessly, but sometimes intentionally through spite when stray oxen\r\ndevastate the plantations of the poorer people. The juice is almost\r\ncertain to be drunk if cattle stray near the place, and death is the\r\ncertain result. The owners kill a beast which shows symptoms of having\r\nbeen poisoned, and retail the beef in the town. Although every one\r\nknows it cannot be wholesome, such is the scarcity of meat and the\r\nuncontrollable desire to eat beef, that it is eagerly bought, at least\r\nby those residents who come from other provinces where beef is the\r\nstaple article of food. Game of all kinds is scarce in the forest near\r\nthe town, except in the months of June and July, when immense numbers\r\nof a large and handsome bird, Cuvier’s toucan (Ramphastos Cuvieri) make\r\ntheir appearance. They come in well-fed condition, and are shot in such\r\nquantities that every family has the strange treat of stewed and\r\nroasted toucans daily for many weeks. Curassow birds are plentiful on\r\nthe banks of the Solimoens, but to get a brace or two requires the\r\nsacrifice of several days for the trip. A tapir, of which the meat is\r\nmost delicious and nourishing, is sometimes killed by a fortunate\r\nhunter. I have still a lively recollection of the pleasant effects\r\nwhich I once experienced from a diet of fresh tapir meat for a few\r\ndays, after having been brought to a painful state of bodily and mental\r\ndepression by a month’s scanty rations of fish and farinha.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes had fresh bread at Ega made from American flour brought\r\nfrom Pará, but it was sold at ninepence a pound. I was once two years\r\nwithout tasting wheaten bread, and attribute partly to this the gradual\r\ndeterioration of health which I suffered on the Upper Amazons. Mandioca\r\nmeal is a poor, weak substitute for bread; it is deficient in gluten,\r\nand consequently cannot be formed into a leavened mass or loaf, but is\r\nobliged to be roasted in hard grains in order to keep any length of\r\ntime. Cakes are made of the half-roasted meal, but they become sour in\r\na very few hours. A superior kind of meal is manufactured at Ega of the\r\nsweet mandioca (Manihot Aypi); it is generally made with a mixture of\r\nthe starch of the root and is therefore a much more wholesome article\r\nof food than the ordinary sort which, on the Amazons, is made of the\r\npulp after the starch has been extracted by soaking in water. When we\r\ncould get neither bread nor biscuit, I found tapioca soaked in coffee\r\nthe best native substitute. We were seldom without butter, as every\r\ncanoe brought one or two casks on each return voyage from Pará, where\r\nit is imported in considerable quantity from Liverpool. We obtained tea\r\nin the same way; it being served as a fashionable luxury at wedding and\r\nchristening parties; the people were at first strangers to this\r\narticle, for they used to stew it in a saucepan, mixing it up with\r\ncoarse raw sugar, and stirring it with a spoon. Sometimes we had milk,\r\nbut this was only when a cow calved; the yield from each cow was very\r\nsmall, and lasted only for a few weeks in each case, although the\r\npasture is good, and the animals are sleek and fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nUikí Fruit.\r\n\r\nFruit of the ordinary tropical sorts could generally be had. I was\r\nquite surprised at the variety of the wild kinds, and of the delicious\r\nflavour of some of them. Many of these are utterly unknown in the\r\nregions nearer the Atlantic, being the peculiar productions of this\r\nhighly favoured, and little known, interior country. Some have been\r\nplanted by the natives in their clearings. The best was the\r\n_Jabutí-púhe_, or tortoise-foot; a scaled fruit probably of the\r\nAnonaceous order. It is about the size of an ordinary apple; when ripe\r\nthe rind is moderately thin, and encloses, with the seeds, a quantity\r\nof custardy pulp of a very rich flavour. Next to this stands the Cumá\r\n(Collophora sp.) of which there are two species, not unlike in\r\nappearance, small round pears; but the rind is rather hard, and\r\ncontains a gummy milk, and the pulpy part is almost as delicious as\r\nthat of the Jabutí-púhe. The Cumá tree is of moderate height, and grows\r\nrather plentifully in the more elevated and drier situations. A third\r\nkind is the Pamá, which is a stone fruit, similar in colour and\r\nappearance to the cherry but of oblong shape. The tree is one of the\r\nloftiest in the forest, and has never, I believe, been selected for\r\ncultivation. To get at the fruit the natives are obliged to climb to\r\nthe height of about a hundred feet, and cut off the heavily laden\r\nbranches. I have already mentioned the Umarí and the Wishí: both these\r\nare now cultivated. The fatty, bitter pulp which surrounds the large\r\nstony seeds of these fruits is eaten mixed with farinha, and is very\r\nnourishing. Another cultivated fruit is the Purumá (Puruma\r\ncecropiæfolia, Martius), a round juicy berry, growing in large bunches\r\nand resembling grapes in taste. Another smaller kind, called Purumá-i,\r\ngrows wild in the forest close to Ega, and has not yet been planted.\r\nThe most singular of all these fruits is the Uikí, which is of oblong\r\nshape, and grows apparently crosswise on the end of its stalk. When\r\nripe, the thick green rind opens by a natural cleft across the middle,\r\nand discloses an oval seed the size of a damascene plum, but of a vivid\r\ncrimson colour. This bright hue belongs to a thin coating of pulp\r\nwhich, when the seeds are mixed in a plate of stewed bananas, gives to\r\nthe mess a pleasant rosy tint, and a rich creamy taste and consistence.\r\n_ Mingua_ (porridge) of bananas flavoured and coloured with Uikí is a\r\nfavourite dish at Ega. The fruit, like most of the others here\r\nmentioned, ripens in January. Many smaller fruits such as Wajurú\r\n(probably a species of Achras), the size of a gooseberry, which grows\r\nsingly and contains a sweet gelatinous pulp, enclosing two large,\r\nshining black seeds; Cashipári-arapaá, an oblong scarlet berry; two\r\nkinds of Bacurí, the Bacurí-siúma and the B. curúa, sour fruits of a\r\nbright lemon colour when ripe, and a great number of others, are of\r\nless importance as articles of food.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated “Peach palm,” _Pupunha_ of the Tupí nations (Guilielma\r\nspeciosa), is a common tree at Ega. The name, I suppose, is in allusion\r\nto the colour of the fruit, and not to its flavour, for it is dry and\r\nmealy, and in taste may be compared to a mixture of chestnuts and\r\ncheese. Vultures devour it eagerly, and come in quarrelsome flocks to\r\nthe trees when it is ripe. Dogs will also eat it: I do not recollect\r\nseeing cats do the same, although they go voluntarily to the woods to\r\neat Tucumá, another kind of palm fruit. The tree, as it grows in\r\nclusters beside the palm-thatched huts, is a noble ornament, being,\r\nwhen full grown, from fifty to sixty feet in height and often as\r\nstraight as a scaffold-pole. A bunch of fruit when ripe is a load for a\r\nstrong man, and each tree bears several of them. The Pupunha grows wild\r\nnowhere on the Amazons. It is one of those few vegetable productions\r\n(including three kinds of mandioca and the American species of banana)\r\nwhich the Indians have cultivated from time immemorial, and brought\r\nwith them in their original migration to Brazil. It is only, however,\r\nthe more advanced tribes who have kept up the cultivation. The\r\nsuperiority of the fruit on the Solimoens to that grown on the Lower\r\nAmazons and in the neighbourhood of Pará is very striking. At Ega it is\r\ngenerally as large as a full-sized peach, and when boiled, almost as\r\nmealy as a potato; whilst at Pará it is no bigger than a walnut, and\r\nthe pulp is fibrous. Bunches of sterile or seedless fruits sometimes\r\noccur in both districts. It is one of the principal articles of food at\r\nEga when in season, and is boiled and eaten with treacle or salt. A\r\ndozen of the seedless fruits makes a good nourishing meal for a\r\ngrown-up person. It is the general belief that there is more nutriment\r\nin Pupunha than in fish or Vacca marina.\r\n\r\n\r\nPupunha Palm.\r\n\r\nThe seasons in the Upper Amazons region offer some points of difference\r\nfrom those of the lower river and the district of Pará, which two\r\nsections of the country we have already seen also differ considerably.\r\nThe year at Ega is divided according to the rises and falls of the\r\nriver, with which coincide the wet and dry periods. All the principal\r\ntransactions of life of the inhabitants are regulated by these yearly\r\nrecurring phenomena. The peculiarity of this upper region consists in\r\nthere being two rises and two falls within the year. The great annual\r\nrise commences about the end of February and continues to the middle of\r\nJune, during which the rivers and lakes, confined during the dry\r\nperiods to their ordinary beds, gradually swell and overflow all the\r\nlower lands. The inundation progresses gently inch by inch, and is felt\r\neverywhere, even in the interior of the forests of the higher lands,\r\nmiles away from the river; as these are traversed by numerous gullies,\r\nforming in the fine season dry, spacious dells, which become gradually\r\ntransformed by the pressure of the flood into broad creeks navigable by\r\nsmall boats under the shade of trees. All the countless swarms of\r\nturtle of various species then leave the main river for the inland\r\npools; the sand-banks go under water, and the flocks of wading birds\r\nmigrate north to the upper waters of the tributaries which flow from\r\nthat direction, or to the Orinoco; which streams during the wet period\r\nof the Amazons are enjoying the cloudless skies of their dry season.\r\nThe families of fishermen who have been employed during the previous\r\nfour or five months in harpooning and salting pirarucu and shooting\r\nturtle in the great lakes, now return to the towns and villages; their\r\ntemporarily constructed fishing establishments becoming gradually\r\nsubmerged with the sand islets or beaches on which they were situated.\r\nThis is the season, however, in which the Brazil nut and wild cacao\r\nripen, and many persons go out to gather these harvests, remaining\r\nabsent generally throughout the months of March and April. The rains\r\nduring this time are not continuous; they fall very heavily at times,\r\nbut rarely last so long at a stretch as twenty-four hours, and many\r\ndays intervene of pleasant, sunny weather. The sky, however, is\r\ngenerally overcast and gloomy, and sometimes a drizzling rain falls.\r\n\r\nAbout the first week in June the flood is at its highest; the water\r\nbeing then about forty-five feet above its lowest point; but it varies\r\nin different years to the extent of about fifteen feet. The “enchente,”\r\nor flow, as it is called by the natives, who believe this great annual\r\nmovement of the waters to be of the same nature as the tide towards the\r\nmouth of the Amazons, is then completed, and all begin to look forward\r\nto the “vasante,” or ebb. The provision made for the dearth of the wet\r\nseason is by this time pretty nearly exhausted; fish is difficult to\r\nprocure and many of the less provident inhabitants have become reduced\r\nto a diet of fruits and farinha porridge.\r\n\r\nThe fine season begins with a few days of brilliant weather—furious,\r\nhot sun, with passing clouds. Idle men and women, tired of the dullness\r\nand confinement of the flood season, begin to report, on returning from\r\ntheir morning bath, the cessation of the flow: _as agoas estao\r\nparadas_, “the waters have stopped.” The muddy streets, in a few days,\r\ndry up; groups of young fellows are now seen seated on the shady sides\r\nof the cottages making arrows and knitting fishing-nets with tucum\r\ntwine; others are busy patching up and caulking their canoes, large and\r\nsmall; in fact, preparations are made on all sides for the much\r\nlonged-for “verao,” or summer, and the “migration,” as it is called, of\r\nfish and turtle; that is, their descent from the inaccessible pools in\r\nthe forest to the main river. Towards the middle of July, the\r\nsand-banks begin to reappear above the surface of the waters, and with\r\nthis change come flocks of sandpipers and gulls, which latter make\r\nknown the advent of the fine season, as the cuckoo does of the European\r\nspring; uttering almost incessantly their plaintive cries as they fly\r\nabout over the shallow waters of sandy shores. Most of the\r\ngaily-plumaged birds have now finished moulting, and begin to be more\r\nactive in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe fall continues to the middle of October, with the interruption of a\r\npartial rise called “repiquet” of a few inches in the midst of very dry\r\nweather in September, caused by the swollen contribution of some large\r\naffluent higher up the river. The amount of subsidence also varies\r\nconsiderably, but it is never so great as to interrupt navigation by\r\nlarge vessels. The greater it is the more abundant is the season.\r\nEveryone is prosperous when the waters are low; the shallow bays and\r\npools being then crowded with the concentrated population of fish and\r\nturtle. All the people, men, women, and children, leave the villages\r\nand spend the few weeks of glorious weather rambling over the vast\r\nundulating expanses of sand in the middle of the Solimoens, fishing,\r\nhunting, collecting eggs of turtle and plovers and thoroughly enjoying\r\nthemselves. The inhabitants pray always for a “vasante grande,” or\r\ngreat ebb.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of October to the beginning of January, the second wet\r\nseason prevails. The rise is sometimes not more than about fifteen\r\nfeet, but it is, in some years, much more extensive, laying the large\r\nsand islands under water before the turtle eggs are hatched. In one\r\nyear, whilst I resided at Ega, this second annual inundation reached to\r\nwithin ten feet of the highest water point as marked by the stains on\r\nthe trunks of trees by the river side.\r\n\r\nThe second dry season comes on in January, and lasts throughout\r\nFebruary. The river sinks sometimes to the extent of a few feet only,\r\nbut one year (1856) I saw it ebb to within about five feet of its\r\nlowest point in September. This is called the summer of the Umarí,\r\n“Veraó do Umarí,” after the fruit of this name already described, which\r\nripens at this season. When the fall is great, this is the best time to\r\ncatch turtles. In the year above mentioned, nearly all the residents\r\nwho had a canoe, and could work a paddle, went out after them in the\r\nmonth of February, and about 2000 were caught in the course of a few\r\ndays. It appears that they had been arrested in their migration towards\r\nthe interior pools of the forest by the sudden drying up of the\r\nwater-courses, and so had become easy prey.\r\n\r\nThus the Ega year is divided into four seasons; two of dry weather and\r\nfalling waters, and two of the reverse. Besides this variety, there is,\r\nin the month of May, a short season of very cold weather, a most\r\nsurprising circumstance in this otherwise uniformly sweltering climate.\r\nThis is caused by the continuance of a cold wind, which blows from the\r\nsouth over the humid forests that extend without interruption from\r\nnorth of the equator to the eighteenth parallel of latitude in Bolivia.\r\nI had, unfortunately, no thermometer with me at Ega; the only one I\r\nbrought with me from England having been lost at Pará. The temperature\r\nis so much lowered that fishes die in the river Teffe, and are cast in\r\nconsiderable quantities on its shores. The wind is not strong, but it\r\nbrings cloudy weather, and lasts from three to five or six days in each\r\nyear. The inhabitants all suffer much from the cold, many of them\r\nwrapping themselves up with the warmest clothing they can get (blankets\r\nare here unknown), and shutting themselves indoors with a charcoal fire\r\nlighted. I found, myself, the change of temperature most delightful,\r\nand did not require extra clothing. It was a bad time, however, for my\r\npursuit, as birds and insects all betook themselves to places of\r\nconcealment, and remained inactive. The period during which this wind\r\nprevails is called the “tempo da friagem,” or the season of coldness.\r\nThe phenomenon, I presume, is to be accounted for by the fact that in\r\nMay it is winter in the southern temperate zone, and that the cool\r\ncurrents of air travelling thence northwards towards the equator become\r\nonly moderately heated in their course, owing to the intermediate\r\ncountry being a vast, partially-flooded plain covered with humid\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\nEXCURSIONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EGA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe River Teffé — Rambles through Groves on the Beach — Excursion to\r\nthe House of a Passé Chieftain — Character and Customs of the Passé\r\nTribe — First Excursion to the Sand Islands of the Solimoens — Habits\r\nof Great River-turtle — Second Excursion — Turtle-fishing in the Inland\r\nPools — Third Excursion — Hunting-rambles with Natives in the Forest —\r\nReturn to Ega.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to give some account of the more interesting of my\r\nshorter excursions in the neighbourhood of Ega. The incidents of the\r\nlonger voyages, which occupied each several months, will be narrated in\r\na separate chapter.\r\n\r\nThe settlement, as before described, is built on a small tract of\r\ncleared land at the lower or eastern end of the lake, six or seven\r\nmiles from the main Amazons, with which the lake communicates by a\r\nnarrow channel. On the opposite shore of the broad expanse stands a\r\nsmall village, called Nogueira, the houses of which are not visible\r\nfrom Ega, except on very clear days; the coast on the Nogueira side is\r\nhigh, and stretches away into the grey distance towards the southwest.\r\nThe upper part of the river Teffé is not visited by the Ega people, on\r\naccount of its extreme unhealthiness, and its barrenness in\r\nsarsaparilla and other wares. To Europeans it would seem a most\r\nsurprising thing that the people of a civilised settlement, a hundred\r\nand seventy years old, should still be ignorant of the course of the\r\nriver on whose banks their native place, for which they proudly claim\r\nthe title of city, is situated. It would be very difficult for a\r\nprivate individual to explore it, as the necessary number of Indian\r\npaddlers could not be obtained. I knew only one person who had ascended\r\nthe Teffé to any considerable distance, and he was not able to give me\r\na distinct account of the river. The only tribe known to live on its\r\nbanks are the Catauishís, a people who perforate their lips all round,\r\nand wear rows of slender sticks in the holes: their territory lies\r\nbetween the Purús and the Juruá, embracing both shores of the Teffé. A\r\nlarge, navigable stream, the Bararuá, enters the lake from the west,\r\nabout thirty miles above Ega; the breadth of the lake is much\r\ncontracted a little below the mouth of this tributary, but it again\r\nexpands further south, and terminates abruptly where the Teffé proper,\r\na narrow river with a strong current, forms its head water.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the country for hundreds of miles is covered with\r\npicturesque but pathless forests, and there are only two roads along\r\nwhich excursions can be made by land from Ega. One is a narrow hunter’s\r\ntrack, about two miles in length, which traverses the forest in the\r\nrear of the settlement. The other is an extremely pleasant path along\r\nthe beach to the west of the town. This is practicable only in the dry\r\nseason, when a flat strip of white sandy beach is exposed at the foot\r\nof the high wooded banks of the lake, covered with trees, which, as\r\nthere is no underwood, form a spacious shady grove. I rambled daily,\r\nduring many weeks of each successive dry season, along this delightful\r\nroad. The trees, many of which are myrtles and wild Guavas, with smooth\r\nyellow stems, were in flower at this time; and the rippling waters of\r\nthe lake, under the cool shade, everywhere bordered the path. The place\r\nwas the resort of kingfishers, green and blue tree-creepers,\r\npurple-headed tanagers, and hummingbirds. Birds generally, however,\r\nwere not numerous. Every tree was tenanted by Cicadas, the reedy notes\r\nof which produced that loud, jarring, insect music which is the general\r\naccompaniment of a woodland ramble in a hot climate. One species was\r\nvery handsome, having wings adorned with patches of bright green and\r\nscarlet. It was very common; sometimes three or four tenanting a single\r\ntree, clinging as usual to the branches. On approaching a tree thus\r\npeopled, a number of little jets of a clear liquid would be seen\r\nsquirted from aloft. I have often received the well-directed discharge\r\nfull on my face; but the liquid is harmless, having a sweetish taste,\r\nand is ejected by the insect from the anus, probably in self-defence,\r\nor from fear. The number and variety of gaily-tinted butterflies,\r\nsporting about in this grove on sunny days, were so great that the\r\nbright moving flakes of colour gave quite a character to the\r\nphysiognomy of the place. It was impossible to walk far without\r\ndisturbing flocks of them from the damp sand at the edge of the water,\r\nwhere they congregated to imbibe the moisture. They were of almost all\r\ncolours, sizes, and shapes: I noticed here altogether eighty species,\r\nbelonging to twenty-two different genera. It is a singular fact that,\r\nwith very few exceptions, all the individuals of these various species\r\nthus sporting in sunny places were of the male sex; their partners,\r\nwhich are much more soberly dressed and immensely less numerous than\r\nthe males, being confined to the shades of the woods. Every afternoon,\r\nas the sun was getting low, I used to notice these gaudy\r\nsunshine-loving swains trooping off to the forest, where I suppose they\r\nwould find their sweethearts and wives. The most abundant, next to the\r\nvery common sulphur-yellow and orange-coloured kinds, were about a\r\ndozen species of Eunica, which are of large size, and are conspicuous\r\nfrom their liveries of glossy dark-blue and purple. A superbly-adorned\r\ncreature, the Callithea Markii, having wings of a thick texture,\r\ncoloured sapphire-blue and orange, was only an occasional visitor. On\r\ncertain days, when the weather was very calm, two small gilded-green\r\nspecies (Symmachia Trochilus and Colubris) literally swarmed on the\r\nsands, their glittering wings lying wide open on the flat surface. The\r\nbeach terminates, eight miles beyond Ega, at the mouth of a rivulet;\r\nthe character of the coast then changes, the river banks being masked\r\nby a line of low islets amid a labyrinth of channels.\r\n\r\nIn all other directions my very numerous excursions were by water; the\r\nmost interesting of those made in the immediate neighbourhood were to\r\nthe houses of Indians on the banks of retired creeks; an account of one\r\nof these trips will suffice.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of May, 1850, I visited, in company with Antonio Cardozo,\r\nthe Delegado, a family of the Passé tribe, who live near the head\r\nwaters of the Igarapé, which flows from the south into the Teffé,\r\nentering it at Ega. The creek is more than a quarter of a mile broad\r\nnear the town, but a few miles inland it gradually contracts, until it\r\nbecomes a mere rivulet flowing through a broad dell in the forest. When\r\nthe river rises it fills this dell; the trunks of the lofty trees then\r\nstand many feet deep in the water, and small canoes are able to travel\r\nthe distance of a day’s journey under the shade, regular paths or\r\nalleys being cut through the branches and lower trees. This is the\r\ngeneral character of the country of the Upper Amazons; a land of small\r\nelevation and abruptly undulated, the hollows forming narrow valleys in\r\nthe dry months, and deep navigable creeks in the wet months. In retired\r\nnooks on the margins of these shady rivulets, a few families or small\r\nhordes of aborigines still linger in nearly their primitive state, the\r\nrelicts of their once numerous tribes. The family we intended to visit\r\non this trip was that of Pedro-uassú (Peter the Great, or Tall Peter),\r\nan old chieftain or Tushaúa of the Passés.\r\n\r\nWe set out at sunrise, in a small igarité, manned by six young Indian\r\npaddlers. After travelling about three miles along the broad portion of\r\nthe creek—which, being surrounded by woods, had the appearance of a\r\nlarge pool—we came to a part where our course seemed to be stopped by\r\nan impenetrable hedge of trees and bushes. We were some time before\r\nfinding the entrance, but when fairly within the shades, a remarkable\r\nscene presented itself. It was my first introduction to these singular\r\nwater-paths. A narrow and tolerably straight alley stretched away for a\r\nlong distance before us; on each side were the tops of bushes and young\r\ntrees, forming a kind of border to the path, and the trunks of the tall\r\nforest trees rose at irregular intervals from the water, their crowns\r\ninterlocking far over our heads, and forming a thick shade. Slender air\r\nroots hung down in clusters, and looping sipós dangled from the lower\r\nbranches; bunches of grass, tillandsiæ, and ferns sat in the forks of\r\nthe larger boughs, and the trunks of trees near the water had adhering\r\nto them round dried masses of freshwater sponges. There was no current\r\nperceptible, and the water was stained of a dark olive-brown hue, but\r\nthe submerged stems could be seen through it to a great depth. We\r\ntravelled at good speed for three hours along this shady road; the\r\ndistance of Pedro’s house from Ega being about twenty miles. When the\r\npaddlers rested for a time, the stillness and gloom of the place became\r\nalmost painful: our voices waked dull echoes as we conversed, and the\r\nnoise made by fishes occasionally whipping the surface of the water was\r\nquite startling. A cool, moist, clammy air pervaded the sunless shade.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the wooded valley, at the commencement, is probably more\r\nthan half a mile, and there is a tolerably clear view for a\r\nconsiderable distance on each side of the water-path through the\r\nirregular colonnade of trees; other paths also, in this part, branch\r\noff right and left from the principal road, leading to the scattered\r\nhouses of Indians on the mainland. The dell contracts gradually towards\r\nthe head of the rivulet, and the forest then becomes denser; the\r\nwater-path also diminishes in width, and becomes more winding, on\r\naccount of the closer growth of the trees. The boughs of some are\r\nstretched forth at no great height over one’s head, and are seen to be\r\nloaded with epiphytes; one orchid I noticed particularly, on account of\r\nits bright yellow flowers growing at the end of flower-stems several\r\nfeet long. Some of the trunks, especially those of palms, close beneath\r\ntheir crowns, were clothed with a thick mass of glossy shield-shaped\r\nPothos plants, mingled with ferns. Arrived at this part we were, in\r\nfact, in the heart of the virgin forest. We heard no noises of animals\r\nin the trees, and saw only one bird, the sky-blue chatterer, sitting\r\nalone on a high branch. For some distance the lower vegetation was so\r\ndense that the road runs under an arcade of foliage, the branches\r\nhaving been cut away only sufficiently to admit of the passage of a\r\nsmall canoe. These thickets are formed chiefly of bamboos, whose\r\nslender foliage and curving stems arrange themselves in elegant,\r\nfeathery bowers; but other social plants,—slender green climbers with\r\ntendrils so eager in aspiring to grasp the higher boughs that they seem\r\nto be endowed almost with animal energy, and certain low trees having\r\nlarge elegantly-veined leaves, contribute also to the jungly masses.\r\nOccasionally we came upon an uprooted tree lying across the path, its\r\nvoluminous crown still held up by thick cables of sipó, connecting it\r\nwith standing trees; a wide circuit had to be made in these cases, and\r\nit was sometimes difficult to find the right path again.\r\n\r\nAt length we arrived at our journey’s end. We were then in a very dense\r\nand gloomy part of the forest: we could see, however, the dry land on\r\nboth sides of the creek, and to our right a small sunny opening\r\nappeared, the landing place to the native dwellings. The water was deep\r\nclose to the bank, and a clean pathway ascended from the shady port to\r\nthe buildings, which were about a furlong distant. My friend Cardozo\r\nwas godfather to a grandchild of Pedro-uassú, whose daughter had\r\nmarried an Indian settled in Ega. He had sent word to the old man that\r\nhe intended to visit him: we were therefore expected.\r\n\r\nAs we landed, Pedro-uassú himself came down to the port to receive us,\r\nour arrival having been announced by the barking of dogs. He was a tall\r\nand thin old man, with a serious, but benignant expression of\r\ncountenance, and a manner much freer from shyness and distrust than is\r\nusual with Indians. He was clad in a shirt of coarse cotton cloth, dyed\r\nwith murishi, and trousers of the same material turned up to the knee.\r\nHis features were sharply delineated—more so than in any Indian face I\r\nhad yet seen; the lips thin and the nose rather high and compressed. A\r\nlarge, square, blue-black tattooed patch occupied the middle of his\r\nface, which, as well as the other exposed parts of his body, was of a\r\nlight reddish-tan colour, instead of the usual coppery-brown hue. He\r\nwalked with an upright, slow gait, and on reaching us saluted Cardozo\r\nwith the air of a man who wished it to be understood that he was\r\ndealing with an equal. My friend introduced me, and I was welcomed in\r\nthe same grave, ceremonious manner. He seemed to have many questions to\r\nask, but they were chiefly about Senhora Felippa, Cardozo’s Indian\r\nhousekeeper at Ega, and were purely complimentary. This studied\r\npoliteness is quite natural to Indians of the advanced agricultural\r\ntribes. The language used was Tupi: I heard no other spoken all the\r\nday. It must be borne in mind that Pedro-uassú had never had much\r\nintercourse with whites; he was, although baptised, a primitive Indian\r\nwho had always lived in retirement, the ceremony of baptism having been\r\ngone through, as it generally is by the aborigines, simply from a wish\r\nto stand well with the whites.\r\n\r\nArrived at the house, we were welcomed by Pedro’s wife: a thin,\r\nwrinkled, active old squaw, tattooed in precisely the same way as her\r\nhusband. She also had sharp features, but her manner was more cordial\r\nand quicker than that of her husband: she talked much, and with great\r\ninflection of voice; whilst the tones of the old man were rather\r\ndrawling and querulous. Her clothing was a long petticoat of thick\r\ncotton cloth, and a very short chemise, not reaching to her waist. I\r\nwas rather surprised to find the grounds around the establishment in\r\nneater order than in any sitio, even of civilised people, I had yet\r\nseen on the Upper Amazons; the stock of utensils and household goods of\r\nall sorts was larger, and the evidences of regular industry and plenty\r\nmore numerous than one usually perceives in the farms of civilised\r\nIndians and whites. The buildings were of the same construction as\r\nthose of the humbler settlers in all other parts of the country. The\r\nfamily lived in a large, oblong, open shed built under the shade of\r\ntrees. Two smaller buildings, detached from the shed and having\r\nmud-walls with low doorways, contained apparently the sleeping\r\napartments of different members of the large household. A small mill\r\nfor grinding sugar-cane, having two cylinders of hard notched wood,\r\nwooden troughs, and kettles for boiling the _guarápa_ (cane juice) to\r\nmake treacle, stood under a separate shed, and near it was a large\r\nenclosed mud-house for poultry. There was another hut and shed a short\r\ndistance off, inhabited by a family dependent on Pedro, and a narrow\r\npathway through the luxuriant woods led to more dwellings of the same\r\nkind. There was an abundance of fruit trees around the place, including\r\nthe never-failing banana, with its long, broad, soft green leaf-blades,\r\nand groups of full-grown Pupúnhas, or peach palms. There was also a\r\nlarge number of cotton and coffee trees. Amongst the utensils I noticed\r\nbaskets of different shapes, made of flattened maranta stalks, and dyed\r\nvarious colours. The making of these is an original art of the Passés,\r\nbut I believe it is also practised by other tribes, for I saw several\r\nin the houses of semi-civilised Indians on the Tapajos.\r\n\r\nThere were only three persons in the house besides the old couple, the\r\nrest of the people being absent; several came in, however, in the\r\ncourse of the day. One was a daughter of Pedro’s, who had an oval\r\ntattooed spot over her mouth; the second was a young grandson; and the\r\nthird the son-in-law from Ega, Cardozo’s _compadre._ The old woman was\r\noccupied, when we entered, in distilling spirits from cará, an edible\r\nroot similar to the potato, by means of a clay still, which had been\r\nmanufactured by herself. The liquor had a reddish tint, but not a very\r\nagreeable flavour. A cup of it, warm from the still, however, was\r\nwelcome after our long journey. Cardozo liked it, emptied his cup, and\r\nreplenished it in a very short time. The old lady was very talkative,\r\nand almost fussy in her desire to please her visitors. We sat in tucúm\r\nhammocks, suspended between the upright posts of the shed. The young\r\nwoman with the blue mouth—who, although married, was as shy as any\r\nyoung maiden of her race—soon became employed in scalding and plucking\r\nfowls for the dinner near the fire on the ground at the other end of\r\nthe dwelling. The son-in-law, Pedro-uassú, and Cardozo now began a long\r\nconversation on the subject of their deceased wife, daughter, and\r\n_comadre._[1] It appeared she had died of consumption—“tisica,” as they\r\ncalled it, a word adopted by the Indians from the Portuguese. The\r\nwidower repeated over and over again, in nearly the same words, his\r\naccount of her illness, Pedro chiming in like a chorus, and Cardozo\r\nmoralising and condoling. I thought the _cauím_ (grog) had a good deal\r\nto do with the flow of talk and warmth of feeling of all three; the\r\nwidower drank and wailed until he became maundering, and finally fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n [1] Co-mother; the term expressing the relationship of a mother to the\r\n godfather of her child.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlow-gun, quiver, and arrow.\r\n\r\nI left them talking, and took a long ramble into the forest, Pedro\r\nsending his grandson, a smiling well-behaved lad of about fourteen\r\nyears of age, to show me the paths, my companion taking with him his\r\n_Zarabatana_, or blow-gun. This instrument is used by all the Indian\r\ntribes on the Upper Amazons. It is generally nine or ten feet long, and\r\nis made of two separate lengths of wood, each scooped out so as to form\r\none-half of the tube. To do this with the necessary accuracy requires\r\nan enormous amount of patient labour, and considerable mechanical\r\nability, the tools used being simply the incisor teeth of the Páca and\r\nCutía. The two half tubes, when finished, are secured together by a\r\nvery close and tight spirally-wound strapping, consisting of long flat\r\nstrips of Jacitára, or the wood of the climbing palm-tree; and the\r\nwhole is smeared afterwards with black wax, the production of a\r\nMelipona bee. The pipe tapers towards the muzzle, and a cup-shaped\r\nmouthpiece, made of wood, is fitted in the broad end. A full-sized\r\n_Zarabatana_ is heavy, and can only be used by an adult Indian who has\r\nhad great practice. The young lads learn to shoot with smaller and\r\nlighter tubes. When Mr. Wallace and I had lessons at Barra in the use\r\nof the blow-gun, of Julio, a Jurí Indian, then in the employ of Mr.\r\nHauxwell, an English bird-collector, we found it very difficult to hold\r\nsteadily the long tubes. The arrows are made from the hard rind of the\r\nleaf-stalks of certain palms, thin strips being cut, and rendered as\r\nsharp as needles by scraping the ends with a knife or the tooth of an\r\nanimal. They are winged with a little oval mass of samaüma silk (from\r\nthe seed-vessels of the silk-cotton tree, Eriodendron samauma), cotton\r\nbeing too heavy. The ball of samauma should fit to a nicety the bore of\r\nthe blowgun; when it does so, the arrow can be propelled with such\r\nforce by the breath that it makes a noise almost as loud as a pop-gun\r\non flying from the muzzle. My little companion was armed with a quiver\r\nfull of these little missiles, a small number of which, sufficient for\r\nthe day’s sport, were tipped with the fatal Urarí poison. The quiver\r\nwas an ornamental affair, the broad rim being made of highly-polished\r\nwood of a rich cherry-red colour (the Moira-piránga, or redwood of the\r\nJapurá). The body was formed of neatly-plaited strips of Maranta\r\nstalks, and the belt by which it was suspended from the shoulder was\r\ndecorated with cotton fringes and tassels.\r\n\r\nWe walked about two miles along a well-trodden pathway, through high\r\ncaapoeira (second-growth forest). A large proportion of the trees were\r\nMelastomas, which bore a hairy yellow fruit, nearly as large and as\r\nwell flavoured as our gooseberry. The season, however, was nearly over\r\nfor them. The road was bordered every inch of the way by a thick bed of\r\nelegant Lycopodiums. An artificial arrangement of trees and bushes\r\ncould scarcely have been made to wear so finished an appearance as this\r\nnaturally decorated avenue. The path at length terminated at a\r\nplantation of mandioca, the largest I had yet seen since I left the\r\nneighbourhood of Pará. There were probably ten acres of cleared land,\r\nand part of the ground was planted with Indian corn, water-melons, and\r\nsugar-cane. Beyond this field there was only a faint hunter’s track,\r\nleading towards the untrodden interior. My companion told me he had\r\nnever heard of there being any inhabitants in that direction (the\r\nsouth). We crossed the forest from this place to another smaller\r\nclearing, and then walked, on our road home, through about two miles of\r\ncaäpoeira of various ages, the sites of old plantations. The only\r\nfruits of our ramble were a few rare insects and a Japú (Cassicus\r\ncristatus), a handsome bird with chestnut and saffron-coloured plumage,\r\nwhich wanders through the tree-tops in large flocks. My little\r\ncompanion brought this down from a height which I calculated at thirty\r\nyards. The blow-gun, however, in the hands of an expert adult Indian,\r\ncan be made to propel arrows so as to kill at a distance of fifty and\r\nsixty yards. The aim is most certain when the tube is held vertically,\r\nor nearly so. It is a far more useful weapon in the forest than a gun,\r\nfor the report of a firearm alarms the whole flock of birds or monkeys\r\nfeeding on a tree, whilst the silent poisoned dart brings the animals\r\ndown one by one until the sportsman has a heap of slain by his side.\r\nNone but the stealthy Indian can use it effectively. The poison, which\r\nmust be fresh to kill speedily, is obtained only of the Indians who\r\nlive beyond the cataracts of the rivers flowing from the north,\r\nespecially the Rio Negro and the Japurá. Its principal ingredient is\r\nthe wood of the Strychnos toxifera, a tree which does not grow in the\r\nhumid forests of the river plains. A most graphic account of the Urarí,\r\nand of an expedition undertaken in search of the tree in Guiana, has\r\nbeen given by Sir Robert Schomburgk.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] _Annals and Magazine of Natural History,_ vol. vii. p. 411.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the house after mid-day, Cardozo was still sipping\r\ncauim, and now looked exceedingly merry. It was fearfully hot; the good\r\nfellow sat in his hammock with a cuya full of grog in his hands; his\r\nbroad honest face all of a glow, and the perspiration streaming down\r\nhis uncovered breast, the unbuttoned shirt having slipped half-way over\r\nhis broad shoulders. Pedro-uassú had not drunk much; he was noted, as I\r\nafterwards learned, for his temperance. But he was standing up as I had\r\nleft him two hours previous, talking to Cardozo in the same monotonous\r\ntones, the conversation apparently not having flagged all the time. I\r\nhad never heard so much talking amongst Indians. The widower was\r\nasleep; the stirring, managing old lady with her daughter were\r\npreparing dinner. This, which was ready soon after I entered, consisted\r\nof boiled fowls and rice, seasoned with large green peppers and lemon\r\njuice, and piles of new, fragrant farinha and raw bananas. It was\r\nserved on plates of English manufacture on a tupé, or large plaited\r\nrush mat, such as is made by the natives pretty generally on the\r\nAmazons. Three or four other Indians, men and women of middle age, now\r\nmade their appearance, and joined in the meal. We all sat round on the\r\nfloor: the women, according to custom, not eating until after the men\r\nhad done. Before sitting down, our host apologised in his usual quiet,\r\ncourteous manner for not having knives and forks; Cardozo and I ate by\r\nthe aid of wooden spoons, the Indians using their fingers. The old man\r\nwaited until we were all served before he himself commenced. At the end\r\nof the meal, one of the women brought us water in a painted clay basin\r\nof Indian manufacture, and a clean coarse cotton napkin, that we might\r\nwash our hands.\r\n\r\nThe horde of Passés of which Pedro-uassú was Tushaúa or chieftain, was\r\nat this time reduced to a very small number of individuals. The disease\r\nmentioned in the last chapter had for several generations made great\r\nhavoc amongst them; many had also entered the service of whites at Ega,\r\nand, of late years, intermarriages with whites, half-castes, and\r\ncivilised Indians had been frequent. The old man bewailed the fate of\r\nhis race to Cardozo with tears in his eyes. “The people of my nation,”\r\nhe said, “have always been good friends to the Caríwas (whites), but\r\nbefore my grandchildren are old like me the name of Passé will be\r\nforgotten.” In so far as the Passés have amalgamated with European\r\nimmigrants or their descendants, and become civilised Brazilian\r\ncitizens, there can scarcely be ground for lamenting their extinction\r\nas a nation; but it fills one with regret to learn how many die\r\nprematurely of a disease which seems to arise on their simply breathing\r\nthe same air as the whites. The original territory of the tribe must\r\nhave been of large extent, for Passés are said to have been found by\r\nthe early Portuguese colonists on the Rio Negro; an ancient settlement\r\non that river, Barcellos, having been peopled by them when it was first\r\nestablished; and they formed also part of the original population of\r\nFonte-boa on the Solimoens. Their hordes were therefore, spread over a\r\nregion 400 miles in length from cast to west. It is probable, however,\r\nthat they have been confounded by the colonists with other neighbouring\r\ntribes who tattoo their faces in a similar manner. The extinct tribe of\r\nYurimaúas, or Sorimóas, from which the river Solimoens derives its\r\nname, according to traditions extant at Ega, resembled the Passés in\r\ntheir slender figures and friendly disposition. These tribes (with\r\nothers lying between them) peopled the banks of the main river and its\r\nby-streams from the mouth of the Rio Negro to Peru. True Passés existed\r\nin their primitive state on the banks of the Issá, 240 miles to the\r\nwest of Ega, within the memory of living persons. The only large body\r\nof them now extant are located on the Japurá, at a place distant about\r\n150 miles from Ega: the population of this horde, however, does not\r\nexceed, from what I could learn, 300 or 400 persons. I think it\r\nprobable that the lower part of the Japurá and its extensive delta\r\nlands formed the original home of this gentle tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Passés are always spoken of in this country as the most advanced of\r\nall the Indian nations in the Amazons region. Under what influences\r\nthis tribe has become so strongly modified in mental, social, and\r\nbodily features it is hard to divine. The industrious habits, fidelity,\r\nand mildness of disposition of the Passés, their docility and, it may\r\nbe added, their personal beauty, especially of the children and women,\r\nmade them from the first very attractive to the Portuguese colonists.\r\nThey were, consequently, enticed in great number from their villages\r\nand brought to Barra and other settlements of the whites. The wives of\r\ngovernors and military officers from Europe were always eager to obtain\r\nchildren for domestic servants; the girls being taught to sew, cook,\r\nweave hammocks, manufacture pillow-lace, and so forth. They have been\r\ngenerally treated with kindness, especially by the educated families in\r\nthe settlements. It is pleasant to have to record that I never heard of\r\na deed of violence perpetrated, on the one side or the other, in the\r\ndealings between European settlers and this noble tribe of savages.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the original customs of the Passés. The mode of\r\nlife of our host Pedro-uassú did not differ much from that of the\r\ncivilised Mamelucos; but he and his people showed a greater industry,\r\nand were more open, cheerful, and generous in their dealings than many\r\nhalf-castes. The authority of Pedro, like that of the Tushaúas,\r\ngenerally was exercised in a mild manner. These chieftains appear able\r\nto command the services of their subjects, since they furnish men to\r\nthe Brazilian authorities when requested; but none of them, even those\r\nof the most advanced tribes, appear to make use of this authority for\r\nthe accumulation of property; the service being exacted chiefly in time\r\nof war. Had the ambition of the chiefs of some of these industrious\r\ntribes been turned to the acquisition of wealth, probably we should\r\nhave seen indigenous civilised nations in the heart of South America\r\nsimilar to those found on the Andes of Peru and Mexico. It is very\r\nprobable that the Passés adopted from the first to some extent the\r\nmanners of the whites. Ribeiro, a Portuguese official who travelled in\r\nthese regions in 1774-5, and wrote an account of his journey, relates\r\nthat they buried their dead in large earthenware vessels (a custom\r\nstill observed amongst other tribes on the Upper Amazons), and that, as\r\nto their marriages, the young men earned their brides by valiant deeds\r\nin war. He also states that they possessed a cosmogony in which the\r\nbelief that the sun was a fixed body, with the earth revolving around\r\nit, was a prominent feature. He says, moreover, that they believed in a\r\nCreator of all things; a future state of rewards and punishments, and\r\nso forth. These notions are so far in advance of the ideas of all other\r\ntribes of Indians, and so little likely to have been conceived and\r\nperfected by a people having no written language or leisured class,\r\nthat we must suppose them to have been derived by the docile Passés\r\nfrom some early missionary or traveller. I never found that the Passés\r\nhad more curiosity or activity of intellect than other Indians. No\r\ntrace of a belief in a future state exists amongst Indians who have not\r\nhad much intercourse with the civilised settlers, and even amongst\r\nthose who have it is only a few of the more gifted individuals who show\r\nany curiosity on the subject. Their sluggish minds seem unable to\r\nconceive or feel the want of a theory of the soul, and of the relations\r\nof man to the rest of Nature or to the Creator. But is it not so with\r\ntotally uneducated and isolated people even in the most highly\r\ncivilised parts of the world? The good qualities of the Passés belong\r\nto the moral part of the character: they lead a contented, unambitious,\r\nand friendly life, a quiet, domestic, orderly existence, varied by\r\noccasional drinking bouts and summer excursions. They are not so\r\nshrewd, energetic, and masterful as the Mundurucús, but they are more\r\neasily taught, because their disposition is more yielding than that of\r\nthe Mundurucús or any other tribe.\r\n\r\nWe started on our return to Ega at half-past four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. Our generous entertainers loaded us with presents. There was\r\nscarcely room for us to sit in the canoe, as they had sent down ten\r\nlarge bundles of sugar-cane, four baskets of farinha, three cedar\r\nplanks, a small hamper of coffee, and two heavy bunches of bananas.\r\nAfter we were embarked, the old lady came with a parting gift for me—a\r\nhuge bowl of smoking hot banana porridge. I was to eat it on the road\r\n“to keep my stomach warm.” Both stood on the bank as we pushed off, and\r\ngave us their adios: “Ikuána Tupána eirúm” (Go with God): a form of\r\nsalutation taught by the old Jesuit missionaries. We had a most\r\nuncomfortable passage, for Cardozo was quite tipsy, and had not\r\nattended to the loading of the boat. The cargo had been placed too far\r\nforward, and to make matters worse, my heavy friend obstinately\r\ninsisted on sitting astride on the top of the pile, instead of taking\r\nhis place near the stern, singing from his perch a most indecent\r\nlove-song, and disregarding the inconvenience of having to bend down\r\nalmost every minute to pass under the boughs of hanging sipós as we\r\nsped rapidly along. The canoe leaked, but not, at first, alarmingly.\r\nLong before sunset, darkness began to close in under those gloomy\r\nshades, and our steersman could not avoid now and then running the boat\r\ninto the thicket. The first time this happened a piece was broken off\r\nthe square prow (rodella); the second time we got squeezed between two\r\ntrees. A short time after this latter accident, being seated near the\r\nstern with my feet on the bottom of the boat, I felt rather suddenly\r\nthe cold water above my ankles. A few minutes more and we should have\r\nsunk, for a seam had been opened forward under the pile of sugar-cane.\r\nTwo of us began to bale, and by the most strenuous efforts managed to\r\nkeep afloat without throwing overboard our cargo. The Indians were\r\nobliged to paddle with extreme slowness to avoid shipping water, as the\r\nedge of our prow was nearly level with the surface; but Cardozo was now\r\npersuaded to change his seat. The sun set, the quick twilight passed,\r\nand the moon soon after began to glimmer through the thick canopy of\r\nfoliage. The prospect of being swamped in this hideous solitude was by\r\nno means pleasant, although I calculated on the chance of swimming to a\r\ntree and finding a nice snug place in the fork of some large bough\r\nwherein to pass the night. At length, after four hours’ tedious\r\nprogress, we suddenly emerged on the open stream where the moonlight\r\nglittered in broad sheets on the gently rippling waters. A little extra\r\ncare was now required in paddling. The Indians plied their strokes with\r\nthe greatest nicety; the lights of Ega (the oil lamps in the houses)\r\nsoon appeared beyond the black wall of forest, and in a short time we\r\nleapt safely ashore.\r\n\r\nA few months after the excursion just narrated, I accompanied Cardozo\r\nin many wanderings on the Solimoens, during which he visited the praias\r\n(sand-islands), the turtle pools in the forests, and the by-streams and\r\nlakes of the great desert river. His object was mainly to superintend\r\nthe business of digging up turtle eggs on the sandbanks, having been\r\nelected commandante for the year by the municipal council of Ega, of\r\nthe “praia real” (royal sand-island) of Shimuní, the one lying nearest\r\nto Ega. There are four of these royal praias within the Ega district (a\r\ndistance of 150 miles from the town), all of which are visited annually\r\nby the Ega people for the purpose of collecting eggs and extracting oil\r\nfrom their yolks. Each has its commander, whose business is to make\r\narrangements for securing to every inhabitant an equal chance in the\r\negg harvest by placing sentinels to protect the turtles whilst laying,\r\nand so forth. The pregnant turtles descend from the interior pools to\r\nthe main river in July and August, before the outlets dry up, and then\r\nseek in countless swarms their favourite sand islands; for it is only a\r\nfew praias that are selected by them out of the great number existing.\r\nThe young animals remain in the pools throughout the dry season. These\r\nbreeding places of turtles then lie twenty to thirty or more feet above\r\nthe level of the river, and are accessible only by cutting roads\r\nthrough the dense forest.\r\n\r\nWe left Ega on our first trip to visit the sentinels whilst the turtles\r\nwere yet laying, on the 26th of September. Our canoe was a stoutly\r\nbuilt igarité, arranged for ten paddlers, and having a large arched\r\ntoldo at the stern under which three persons could sleep pretty\r\ncomfortably. Emerging from the Teffé we descended rapidly on the swift\r\ncurrent of the Solimoens to the south-eastern or lower end of the large\r\nwooded island of Bariá, which here divides the river into two great\r\nchannels. We then paddled across to Shimuní, which lies in the middle\r\nof the north-easterly channel, reaching the commencement of the praia\r\nan hour before sunset. The island proper is about three miles long and\r\nhalf a mile broad: the forest with which it is covered rises to an\r\nimmense and uniform height, and presents all round a compact,\r\nimpervious front. Here and there a singular tree, called Pao mulatto\r\n(mulatto wood), with polished dark-green trunk, rose conspicuously\r\namongst the mass of vegetation. The sandbank, which lies at the upper\r\nend of the island, extends several miles and presents an irregular, and\r\nin some parts, strongly-waved surface, with deep hollows and ridges.\r\nWhen upon it, one feels as though treading an almost boundless field of\r\nsand, for towards the south-east, where no forest line terminates the\r\nview, the white, rolling plain stretches away to the horizon. The\r\nnorth-easterly channel of the river lying between the sands and the\r\nfurther shore of the river is at least two miles in breadth; the middle\r\none, between the two islands, Shimuní and Bariá, is not much less than\r\na mile.\r\n\r\nWe found the two sentinels lodged in a corner of the praia, where it\r\ncommences at the foot of the towering forest wall of the island, having\r\nbuilt for themselves a little rancho with poles and palm-leaves. Great\r\nprecautions are obliged to be taken to avoid disturbing the sensitive\r\nturtles, who, previous to crawling ashore to lay, assemble in great\r\nshoals off the sandbank. The men, during this time, take care not to\r\nshow themselves and warn off any fishermen who wishes to pass near the\r\nplace. Their fires are made in a deep hollow near the borders of the\r\nforest, so that the smoke may not be visible. The passage of a boat\r\nthrough the shallow waters where the animals are congregated, or the\r\nsight of a man or a fire on the sandbank, would prevent the turtles\r\nfrom leaving the water that night to lay their eggs, and if the causes\r\nof alarm were repeated once or twice, they would forsake the praia for\r\nsome other quieter place. Soon after we arrived, our men were sent with\r\nthe net to catch a supply of fish for supper. In half an hour, four or\r\nfive large basketsful of Acari were brought in. The sun set soon after\r\nour meal was cooked; we were then obliged to extinguish the fire and\r\nremove our supper materials to the sleeping ground, a spit of sand\r\nabout a mile off; this course being necessary on account of the\r\nmosquitoes which swarm at night on the borders of the forest.\r\n\r\nOne of the sentinels was a taciturn, morose-looking, but sober and\r\nhonest Indian, named Daniel; the other was a noted character of Ega, a\r\nlittle wiry Mameluco, named Carepíra (Fish-hawk); known for his\r\nwaggery, propensity for strong drink, and indebtedness to Ega traders.\r\nBoth were intrepid canoemen and huntsmen, and both perfectly at home\r\nanywhere in these fearful wastes of forest and water. Carepíra had his\r\nson with him, a quiet little lad of about nine years of age. These men\r\nin a few minutes constructed a small shed with four upright poles and\r\nleaves of the arrow-grass, under which Cardozo and I slung our\r\nhammocks. We did not go to sleep, however, until after midnight: for\r\nwhen supper was over, we lay about on the sand with a flask of rum in\r\nour midst, and whiled away the still hours in listening to Carepíra’s\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nI rose from my hammock by daylight, shivering with cold; a praia, on\r\naccount of the great radiation of heat in the night from the sand,\r\nbeing towards the dawn the coldest place that can be found in this\r\nclimate. Cardozo and the men were already up watching the turtles. The\r\nsentinels had erected for this purpose a stage about fifty feet high,\r\non a tall tree near their station, the ascent to which was by a\r\nroughly-made ladder of woody lianas. They are enabled, by observing the\r\nturtles from this watch-tower, to ascertain the date of successive\r\ndeposits of eggs, and thus guide the commandante in fixing the time for\r\nthe general invitation to the Ega people. The turtles lay their eggs by\r\nnight, leaving the water when nothing disturbs them, in vast crowds,\r\nand crawling to the central and highest part of the praia. These places\r\nare, of course, the last to go under water when, in unusually wet\r\nseasons, the river rises before the eggs are hatched by the heat of the\r\nsand. One could almost believe from this that the animals used\r\nforethought in choosing a place; but it is simply one of those many\r\ninstances in animals where unconscious habit has the same result as\r\nconscious prevision. The hours between midnight and dawn are the\r\nbusiest. The turtles excavate with their broad, webbed paws, deep holes\r\nin the fine sand: the first corner, in each case, making a pit about\r\nthree feet deep, laying its eggs (about 120 in number) and covering\r\nthem with sand; the next making its deposit at the top of that of its\r\npredecessor, and so on until every pit is full. The whole body of\r\nturtles frequenting a praia does not finish laying in less than\r\nfourteen or fifteen days, even when there is no interruption. When all\r\nhave done, the area (called by the Brazilians _taboleiro_) over which\r\nthey have excavated is distinguishable from the rest of the praia only\r\nby signs of the sand having been a little disturbed.\r\n\r\nOn rising, I went to join my friends. Few recollections of my Amazonian\r\nrambles are more vivid and agreeable than that of my walk over the\r\nwhite sea of sand on this cool morning. The sky was cloudless; the\r\njust-risen sun was hidden behind the dark mass of woods on Shimuní, but\r\nthe long line of forest to the west, on Bariá, with its plumy\r\ndecorations of palms, was lighted up with his yellow, horizontal rays.\r\nA faint chorus of singing birds reached the ears from across the water,\r\nand flocks of gulls and plovers were drying plaintively over the\r\nswelling banks of the praia, where their eggs lay in nests made in\r\nlittle hollows of the sand. Tracks of stray turtles were visible on the\r\nsmooth white surface of the praia. The animals which thus wander from\r\nthe main body are lawful prizes of the sentinels; they had caught in\r\nthis way two before sunrise, one of which we had for dinner. In my walk\r\nI disturbed several pairs of the chocolate and drab-coloured wild-goose\r\n(Anser jubatus) which set off to run along the edge of the water. The\r\nenjoyment one feels in rambling over these free, open spaces, is no\r\ndoubt enhanced by the novelty of the scene, the change being very great\r\nfrom the monotonous landscape of forest which everywhere else presents\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the edge of the forest I mounted the sentinel’s stage,\r\njust in time to see the turtles retreating to the water on the opposite\r\nside of the sand-bank, after having laid their eggs. The sight was well\r\nworth the trouble of ascending the shaky ladder. They were about a mile\r\noff, but the surface of the sands was blackened with the multitudes\r\nwhich were waddling towards the river; the margin of the praia was\r\nrather steep, and they all seemed to tumble head first down the\r\ndeclivity into the water.\r\n\r\nI spent the morning of the 27th collecting insects in the woods of\r\nShimuní; and assisted my friend in the afternoon to beat a large pool\r\nfor Tracajás, Cardozo wishing to obtain a supply for his table at home.\r\nThe pool was nearly a mile long, and lay on one side of the island\r\nbetween the forest and the sand-bank. The sands are heaped up very\r\ncuriously around the margins of these isolated sheets of water; in the\r\npresent case they formed a steeply-inclined bank, from five to eight\r\nfeet in height. What may be the cause of this formation I cannot\r\nimagine. The pools always contain a quantity of imprisoned fish,\r\nturtles, Tracajás, and Aiyussás.[3] The turtles and Aiyussás crawl out\r\nvoluntarily in the course of a few days, and escape to the main river,\r\nbut the Tracajás remain and become an easy prey to the natives. The\r\nordinary mode of obtaining them is to whip the water in every part with\r\nrods for several hours during the day; this treatment having the effect\r\nof driving the animals out. They wait, however, until the night\r\nfollowing the beating before making their exit. Our Indians were\r\noccupied for many hours in this work, and when night came they and the\r\nsentinels were placed at intervals along the edge of the water to be\r\nready to capture the runaways. Cardozo and I, after supper, went and\r\ntook our station at one end of the pool.\r\n\r\n [3] Specimens of this species of turtle are named in the British\r\n Museum collection, _Podocnemis expansa._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not succeed, after all our trouble, in getting many Tracajás.\r\nThis was partly owing to the intense darkness of the night, and partly,\r\ndoubtless, to the sentinels having already nearly exhausted the pool,\r\nnotwithstanding their declarations to the contrary. In waiting for the\r\nanimals, it was necessary to keep silence: not a pleasant way of\r\npassing the night; speaking only in whispers, and being without fire in\r\na place liable to be visited by a prowling jaguar. Cardozo and I sat on\r\na sandy slope with our loaded guns by our side, but it was so dark we\r\ncould scarcely see each other. Towards midnight a storm began to gather\r\naround us. The faint wind which had breathed from over the water since\r\nthe sun went down, ceased; thick clouds piled themselves up, until\r\nevery star was obscured, and gleams of watery lightning began to play\r\nin the midst of the black masses. I hinted to Cardozo that I thought we\r\nhad now had enough of watching, and suggested a cigarette. Just then a\r\nquick pattering movement was heard on the sands, and grasping our guns,\r\nwe both started to our feet. Whatever it might have been it seemed to\r\npass by, and a few moments afterwards a dark body appeared to be moving\r\nin another direction on the opposite slope of the sandy ravine where we\r\nlay. We prepared to fire, but luckily took the precaution of first\r\nshouting “Quem vai lá?” (Who goes there?) It turned out to be the\r\ntaciturn sentinel, Daniel, who asked us mildly whether we had heard a\r\n“raposa” pass our way. The raposa is a kind of wild dog, with very long\r\ntapering muzzle, and black and white speckled hair. Daniel could\r\ndistinguish all kinds of animals in the dark by their footsteps. It now\r\nbegan to thunder, and our position was getting very uncomfortable.\r\nDaniel had not seen anything of the other Indians, and thought it was\r\nuseless waiting any longer for Tracajás; we therefore sent him to call\r\nin the whole party, and made off ourselves, as quickly as we could, for\r\nthe canoe. The rest of the night was passed most miserably; as indeed\r\nwere very many of my nights on the Solimoens. A furious squall burst\r\nupon us; the wind blew away the cloths and mats we had fixed up at the\r\nends of the arched awning of the canoe to shelter ourselves, and the\r\nrain beat right through our sleeping-place. There we lay, Cardozo and\r\nI, huddled together, and wet through, waiting for the morning.\r\n\r\nA cup of strong and hot coffee put us to rights at sunrise, but the\r\nrain was still coming down, having changed to a steady drizzle. Our men\r\nwere all returned from the pool, having taken only four Tracajás. The\r\nbusiness which had brought Cardozo hither being now finished, we set\r\nout to return to Ega, leaving the sentinels once more to their solitude\r\non the sands. Our return route was by the rarely frequented\r\nnorth-easterly channel of the Solimoens, through which flows part of\r\nthe waters of its great tributary stream, the Japurá. We travelled for\r\nfive hours along the desolate, broken, timber-strewn shore of Bariá.\r\nThe channel is of immense breadth, the opposite coast being visible\r\nonly as a long, low line of forest. At three o’clock in the afternoon\r\nwe doubled the upper end of the island, and then crossed towards the\r\nmouth of the Teffé by a broad transverse channel running between Bariá\r\nand another island called Quanarú. There is a small sand-bank at the\r\nnorth-westerly point of Bariá, called Jacaré; we stayed here to dine\r\nand afterwards fished with the net. A fine rain was still falling, and\r\nwe had capital sport, in three hauls taking more fish than our canoe\r\nwould conveniently hold. They were of two kinds only, the Surubim and\r\nthe Piraepiéüa (species of Pimelodus), very handsome fishes, four feet\r\nin length, with flat spoon-shaped heads, and prettily-spotted and\r\nstriped skins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurubin (Pimelodus tigrinus.)\r\n\r\nOn our way from Jacaré to the mouth of the Teffé we had a little\r\nadventure with a black tiger or jaguar. We were paddling rapidly past a\r\nlong beach of dried mud, when the Indians became suddenly excited,\r\nshouting “Ecuí Jauareté; Jauarípixúna!” (Behold the jaguar, the black\r\njaguar!) Looking ahead we saw the animal quietly drinking at the\r\nwater’s edge. Cardozo ordered the steersman at once to put us ashore.\r\nBy the time we were landed the tiger had seen us, and was retracing his\r\nsteps towards the forest. On the spur of the moment, and without\r\nthinking of what we were doing, we took our guns (mine was a\r\ndouble-barrel, with one charge of BB and one of dust-shot) and gave\r\nchase. The animal increased his speed, and reaching the forest border,\r\ndived into the dense mass of broad-leaved grass which formed its\r\nfrontage. We peeped through the gap he had made, but, our courage being\r\nby this time cooled, we did not think it wise to go into the thicket\r\nafter him. The black tiger appears to be more abundant than the spotted\r\nform of jaguar in the neighbourhood of Ega. The most certain method of\r\nfinding it is to hunt assisted by a string of Indians shouting and\r\ndriving the game before them in the narrow _restingas_ or strips of dry\r\nland in the forest, which are isolated by the flooding of their\r\nneighbourhood in the wet season. We reached Ega by eight o’clock that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October we left Ega on a second excursion; the principal\r\nobject of Cardozo being, this time, to search certain pools in the\r\nforest for young turtles. The exact situation of these hidden sheets of\r\nwater is known only to a few practised huntsmen; we took one of these\r\nmen with us from Ega, a Mameluco named Pedro, and on our way called at\r\nShimuní for Daniel to serve as an additional guide. We started from the\r\npraia at sunrise on the 7th in two canoes containing twenty-three\r\npersons, nineteen of whom were Indians. The morning was cloudy and\r\ncool, and a fresh wind blew from down river, against which we had to\r\nstruggle with all the force of our paddles, aided by the current; the\r\nboats were tossed about most disagreeably, and shipped a great deal of\r\nwater. On passing the lower end of Shimuní, a long reach of the river\r\nwas before us, undivided by islands; a magnificent expanse of water\r\nstretching away to the south-east. The country on the left bank is not,\r\nhowever, terra firma, but a portion of the alluvial land which forms\r\nthe extensive and complex delta region of the Japurá. It is flooded\r\nevery year at the time of high water, and is traversed by many narrow\r\nand deep channels which serve as outlets to the Japurá, or at least,\r\nare connected with that river by means of the interior water-system of\r\nthe Cupiyó. This inhospitable tract of country extends for several\r\nhundred miles, and contains in its midst an endless number of pools and\r\nlakes tenanted by multitudes of turtles, fishes, alligators, and water\r\nserpents. Our destination was a point on this coast situated about\r\ntwenty miles below Shimuní, and a short distance from the mouth of the\r\nAnaná, one of the channels just alluded to as connected with the\r\nJapurá. After travelling for three hours in midstream we steered for\r\nthe land, and brought to under a steeply-inclined bank of crumbly\r\nearth, shaped into a succession of steps or terraces, marking the\r\nvarious halts which the waters of the river make in the course of\r\nsubsidence. The coast line was nearly straight for many miles, and the\r\nbank averaged about thirty feet in height above the present level of\r\nthe river: at the top rose the unbroken hedge of forest. No one could\r\nhave divined that pools of water existed on that elevated land. A\r\nnarrow level space extended at the foot of the bank. On landing the\r\nfirst business was to get breakfast. Whilst a couple of Indian lads\r\nwere employed in making the fire, roasting the fish, and boiling the\r\ncoffee, the rest of the party mounted the bank, and with their long\r\nhunting knives commenced cutting a path through the forest; the pool,\r\ncalled the Aningal, being about half a mile distant. After breakfast, a\r\ngreat number of short poles were cut and were laid crosswise on the\r\npath, and then three light montarias which we had brought with us were\r\ndragged up the bank by lianas, and rolled away to be embarked on the\r\npool. A large net, seventy yards in length, was then disembarked and\r\ncarried to the place. The work was done very speedily, and when Cardozo\r\nand I went to the spot at eleven o’clock, we found some of the older\r\nIndians, including Pedro and Daniel, had begun their sport. They were\r\nmounted on little stages called moutas, made of poles and cross-pieces\r\nof wood secured with lianas, and were shooting the turtles as they came\r\nnear the surface, with bows and arrows. The Indians seemed to think\r\nthat netting the animals, as Cardozo proposed doing, was not lawful\r\nsport, and wished first to have an hour or two’s old-fashioned practice\r\nwith their weapons.\r\n\r\nThe pool covered an area of about four or five acres, and was closely\r\nhemmed in by the forest, which in picturesque variety and grouping of\r\ntrees and foliage exceeded almost everything I had yet witnessed. The\r\nmargins for some distance were swampy, and covered with large tufts of\r\na fine grass called Matupá. These tufts in many places were overrun\r\nwith ferns, and exterior to them a crowded row of arborescent arums,\r\ngrowing to a height of fifteen or twenty feet, formed a green palisade.\r\nAround the whole stood the taller forest trees; palmate-leaved Cecropiæ\r\nslender Assai palms, thirty feet high, with their thin feathery heads\r\ncrowning the gently-curving, smooth stems; small fan-leaved palms; and\r\nas a background to all these airy shapes, lay the voluminous masses of\r\nordinary forest trees, with garlands, festoons, and streamers of leafy\r\nclimbers hanging from their branches. The pool was nowhere more than\r\nfive feet deep, one foot of which was not water, but extremely fine and\r\nsoft mud.\r\n\r\nCardozo and I spent an hour paddling about. I was astonished at the\r\nskill which the Indians display in shooting turtles. They did not wait\r\nfor their coming to the surface to breathe, but watched for the slight\r\nmovements in the water, which revealed their presence underneath. These\r\nlittle tracks on the water are called the Sirirí; the instant one was\r\nperceived an arrow flew from the bow of the nearest man, and never\r\nfailed to pierce the shell of the submerged animal. When the turtle was\r\nvery distant, of course the aim had to be taken at a considerable\r\nelevation, but the marksmen preferred a longish range, because the\r\narrow then fell more perpendicularly on the shell and entered it more\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrow used in turtle shooting.\r\n\r\nThe arrow used in turtle shooting has a strong lancet-shaped steel\r\npoint, fitted into a peg which enters the tip of the shaft. The peg is\r\nsecured to the shaft by twine made of the fibres of pineapple leaves,\r\nthe twine being some thirty or forty yards in length, and neatly wound\r\nround the body of the arrow. When the missile enters the shell, the peg\r\ndrops out, and the pierced animal descends with it towards the bottom,\r\nleaving the shaft floating on the surface. This being done, the\r\nsportsman paddles in his montaria to the place, and gently draws the\r\nanimal by the twine, humouring it by giving it the rein when it\r\nplunges, until it is brought again near the surface, when he strikes it\r\nwith a second arrow. With the increased hold given by the two cords he\r\nhas then no difficulty in landing his game.\r\n\r\nBy mid-day the men had shot about a score of nearly full-grown turtles.\r\nCardozo then gave orders to spread the net. The spongy, swampy nature\r\nof the banks made it impossible to work the net so as to draw the booty\r\nashore; another method was therefore adopted. The net was taken by two\r\nIndians and extended in a curve at one extremity of the oval-shaped\r\npool, holding it when they had done so by the perpendicular rods fixed\r\nat each end; its breadth was about equal to the depth of the water, its\r\nshotted side therefore rested on the bottom, whilst the floats buoyed\r\nit up on the surface, so that the whole, when the ends were brought\r\ntogether, would form a complete trap. The rest of the party then spread\r\nthemselves around the swamp at the opposite end of the pool and began\r\nto beat, with stout poles, the thick tufts of Matupá, in order to drive\r\nthe turtles towards the middle. This was continued for an hour or more,\r\nthe beaters gradually drawing nearer to each other, and driving the\r\nhost of animals before them; the number of little snouts constantly\r\npopping above the surface of the water showing that all was going on\r\nwell. When they neared the net the men moved more quickly, shouting and\r\nbeating with great vigour. The ends of the net were then seized by\r\nseveral strong hands and dragged suddenly forwards, bringing them at\r\nthe same time together, so as to enclose all the booty in a circle.\r\nEvery man now leapt into the enclosure, the boats were brought up, and\r\nthe turtles easily captured by the hand and tossed into them. I jumped\r\nin along with the rest, although I had just before made the discovery\r\nthat the pool abounded in ugly, red, four-angled leeches, having seen\r\nseveral of these delectable animals, which sometimes fasten on the legs\r\nof fishermen, although they, did not, on this day, trouble us, working\r\ntheir way through cracks in the bottom of our montaria. Cardozo, who\r\nremained with the boats, could not turn the animals on their backs fast\r\nenough, so that a great many clambered out and got free again. However,\r\nthree boat-loads, or about eighty, were secured in about twenty\r\nminutes. They were then taken ashore, and each one secured by the men\r\ntying the legs with thongs of bast.\r\n\r\nWhen the canoes had been twice filled, we desisted, after a very hard\r\nday’s work. Nearly all the animals were young ones, chiefly, according\r\nto the statement of Pedro, from three to ten years of age; they varied\r\nfrom six to eighteen inches in length, and were very fat. Cardozo and I\r\nlived almost exclusively on them for several months afterwards. Roasted\r\nin the shell they form a most appetising dish. These younger turtles\r\nnever migrate with their elders on the sinking of the waters, but\r\nremain in the tepid pools, fattening on fallen fruits, and, according\r\nto the natives, on the fine nutritious mud. We captured a few\r\nfull-grown mother-turtles, which were known at once by the horny skin\r\nof their breast-plates being worn, telling of their having crawled on\r\nthe sands to lay eggs the previous year. They had evidently made a\r\nmistake in not leaving the pool at the proper time, for they were full\r\nof eggs, which, we were told, they would, before the season was over,\r\nscatter in despair over the swamp. We also found several male turtles,\r\nor Capitarí0s, as they are called by the natives. These are immensely\r\nless numerous than the females, and are distinguishable by their much\r\nsmaller size, more circular shape, and the greater length and thickness\r\nof their tails. Their flesh is considered unwholesome, especially to\r\nsick people having external signs of inflammation. All diseases in\r\nthese parts, as well as their remedies and all articles of food, are\r\nclassed by the inhabitants as “hot” and “cold,” and the meat of the\r\nCapitarí is settled by unanimous consent as belonging to the “hot”\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nWe dined on the banks of the river a little before sunset. The\r\nmosquitoes then began to be troublesome, and finding it would be\r\nimpossible to sleep here, we all embarked and crossed the river to a\r\nsand-bank, about three miles distant, where we passed the night.\r\nCardozo and I slept in our hammocks slung between upright poles, the\r\nrest stretching themselves on the sand round a large fire. We lay awake\r\nconversing until past midnight. It was a real pleasure to listen to the\r\nstories told by one of the older men, they were given with so much\r\nspirit. The tales always related to struggles with some intractable\r\nanimal—jaguar, manatee, or alligator. Many interjections and expressive\r\ngestures were used, and at the end came a sudden “Pa! terra!” when the\r\nanimal was vanquished by a shot or a blow. Many mysterious tales were\r\nrecounted about the Bouto, as the large Dolphin of the Amazons is\r\ncalled. One of them was to the effect that a Bouto once had the habit\r\nof assuming the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to\r\nher heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice\r\nthe young men down to the water. If any one was so much smitten as to\r\nfollow her to the waterside, she grasped her victim round the waist and\r\nplunged beneath the waves with a triumphant cry. No animal in the\r\nAmazons region is the subject of so many fables as the Bouto; but it is\r\nprobable these did not originate with the Indians, but with the\r\nPortuguese colonists. It was several years before I could induce a\r\nfisherman to harpoon Dolphins for me as specimens, for no one ever\r\nkills these animals voluntarily, although their fat is known to yield\r\nan excellent oil for lamps. The superstitious people believe that\r\nblindness would result from the use of this oil in lamps. I succeeded\r\nat length with Carepira, by offering him a high reward when his\r\nfinances were at a very low point, but he repented of his deed ever\r\nafterwards, declaring that his luck had forsaken him from that day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we again beat the pool. Although we had proof of there\r\nbeing a great number of turtles yet remaining, we had very poor\r\nsuccess. The old Indians told us it would be so, for the turtles were\r\n“ladino” (cunning), and would take no notice of the beating a second\r\nday. When the net was formed into a circle, and the men had jumped in,\r\nan alligator was found to be inclosed. No one was alarmed, the only\r\nfear expressed being that the imprisoned beast would tear the net.\r\nFirst one shouted, “I have touched his head;” then another, “he has\r\nscratched my leg;” one of the men, a lanky Miránha, was thrown off his\r\nbalance, and then there was no end to the laughter and shouting. At\r\nlast a youth of about fourteen years of age, on my calling to him from\r\nthe bank to do so, seized the reptile by the tail, and held him tightly\r\nuntil, a little resistance being overcome, he was able to bring it\r\nashore. The net was opened, and the boy slowly dragged the dangerous\r\nbut cowardly beast to land through the muddy water, a distance of about\r\na hundred yards. Meantime, I had cut a strong pole from a tree, and as\r\nsoon as the alligator was drawn to solid ground, gave him a smart rap\r\nwith it on the crown of his head, which killed him instantly. It was a\r\ngood-sized individual, the jaws being considerably more than a foot\r\nlong, and fully capable of snapping a man’s leg in twain. The species\r\nwas the large cayman, the Jacaré-uassú of the Amazonian Indians (Jacare\r\nnigra).\r\n\r\nOn the third day, we sent our men in the boats to net turtles in a\r\nlarger pool about five miles further down the river, and on the fourth,\r\nreturned to Ega.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to mention here a few circumstances relative to the\r\nlarge Cayman, which, with the incident just narrated, afford\r\nillustrations of the cunning, cowardice, and ferocity of this reptile.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto had but few occasions of mentioning alligators,\r\nalthough they exist by myriads in the waters of the Upper Amazons. Many\r\ndifferent species are spoken of by the natives. I saw only three, and\r\nof these two only are common: one, the Jacaré-tinga, a small kind (five\r\nfeet long when full grown), having a long slender muzzle and a\r\nblack-banded tail; the other, the Jacaré-uassú, to which these remarks\r\nmore especially relate and the third the Jacaré-curúa, mentioned in a\r\nformer chapter. The Jacaré-uassú, or large Cayman, grows to a length of\r\neighteen or twenty feet, and attains an enormous bulk. Like the\r\nturtles, the alligator has its annual migrations, for it retreats to\r\nthe interior pools and flooded forests in the wet season, and descends\r\nto the main river in the dry season. During the months of high water,\r\ntherefore, scarcely a single individual is to be seen in the main\r\nriver. In the middle part of the Lower Amazons, about Obydos and Villa\r\nNova, where many of the lakes with their channels of communication with\r\nthe trunk stream dry up in the fine months, the alligator buries itself\r\nin the mud and becomes dormant, sleeping till the rainy season returns.\r\nOn the Upper Amazons, where the dry season is never excessive, it has\r\nnot this habit, but is lively all the year round. It is scarcely\r\nexaggerating to say that the waters of the Solimoens are as well\r\nstocked with large alligators in the dry season, as a ditch in England\r\nis in summer with tadpoles. During a journey of five days which I once\r\nmade in the Upper Amazons steamer, in November, alligators were seen\r\nalong the coast almost every step of the way, and the passengers amused\r\nthemselves, from morning till night, by firing at them with rifle and\r\nball. They were very numerous in the still bays, where the huddled\r\ncrowds jostled together, to the great rattling of their coats of mail,\r\nas the steamer passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurtle fishing and adventure with alligator.\r\n\r\nThe natives at once despise and fear the great cayman. I once spent a\r\nmonth at Caiçara, a small village of semi-civilised Indians, about\r\ntwenty miles to the west of Ega. My entertainer, the only white in the\r\nplace, and one of my best and most constant friends, Senhor Innocencio\r\nAlves Faria, one day proposed a half-day’s fishing with net in the\r\nlake,—the expanded bed of the small river on which the village is\r\nsituated. We set out in an open boat with six Indians and two of\r\nInnocencio’s children. The water had sunk so low that the net had to be\r\ntaken out into the middle by the Indians, whence at the first draught,\r\ntwo medium-sized alligators were brought to land. They were disengaged\r\nfrom the net and allowed, with the coolest unconcern, to return to the\r\nwater, although the two children were playing in it not many yards off.\r\nWe continued fishing, Innocencio and I lending a helping hand, and each\r\ntime drew a number of the reptiles of different ages and sizes, some of\r\nthem Jacaré-tingas; the lake, in fact, swarmed with alligators. After\r\ntaking a very large quantity of fish, we prepared to return, and the\r\nIndians, at my suggestion, secured one of the alligators with the view\r\nof letting it loose amongst the swarms of dogs in the village. An\r\nindividual was selected about eight feet long: one man holding his head\r\nand another his tail, whilst a third took a few lengths of a flexible\r\nliana, and deliberately bound the jaws and the legs. Thus secured, the\r\nbeast was laid across the benches of the boat on which we sat during\r\nthe hour and a half’s journey to the settlement. We were rather\r\ncrowded, but our amiable passenger gave us no trouble during the\r\ntransit. On reaching the village, we took the animal into the middle of\r\nthe green, in front of the church, where the dogs were congregated, and\r\nthere gave him his liberty, two of us arming ourselves with long poles\r\nto intercept him if he should make for the water, and the others\r\nexciting the dogs. The alligator showed great terror, although the dogs\r\ncould not be made to advance, and made off at the top of its speed for\r\nthe water, waddling like a duck. We tried to keep him back with the\r\npoles, but he became enraged, and seizing the end of the one I held in\r\nhis jaws, nearly wrenched it from my grasp. We were obliged, at length,\r\nto kill him to prevent his escape.\r\n\r\nThese little incidents show the timidity or cowardice of the alligator.\r\nHe never attacks man when his intended victim is on his guard; but he\r\nis cunning enough to know when this may be done with impunity: of this\r\nwe had proof at Caiçara, a few days afterwards. The river had sunk to a\r\nvery low point, so that the port and bathing-place of the village now\r\nlay at the foot of a long sloping bank, and a large cayman made his\r\nappearance in the shallow and muddy water. We were all obliged to be\r\nvery careful in taking our bath; most of the people simply using a\r\ncalabash, pouring the water over themselves whilst standing on the\r\nbrink. A large trading canoe, belonging to a Barra merchant named\r\nSoares, arrived at this time, and the Indian crew, as usual, spent the\r\nfirst day or two after their coming into port in drunkenness and\r\ndebauchery ashore. One of the men, during the greatest heat of the day,\r\nwhen almost everyone was enjoying his afternoon’s nap, took it into his\r\nhead whilst in a tipsy state to go down alone to bathe. He was seen\r\nonly by the Juiz de Paz, a feeble old man who was lying in his hammock\r\nin the open verandah at the rear of his house on the top of the bank,\r\nand who shouted to the besotted Indian to beware of the alligator.\r\nBefore he could repeat his warning, the man stumbled, and a pair of\r\ngaping jaws, appearing suddenly above the surface, seized him round the\r\nwaist and drew him under the water. A cry of agony “Ai Jesús!” was the\r\nlast sign made by the wretched victim. The village was aroused: the\r\nyoung men with praiseworthy readiness seized their harpoons and hurried\r\ndown to the bank; but, of course it was too late, a winding track of\r\nblood on the surface of the water was all that could be seen. They\r\nembarked, however, in montarias, determined upon vengeance; the monster\r\nwas traced, and when, after a short lapse of time, he came up to\r\nbreathe—one leg of the man sticking out from his jaws—was despatched\r\nwith bitter curses.\r\n\r\nThe last of these minor excursions which I shall narrate, was made\r\n(again in company of Senhor Cardozo, with the addition of his\r\nhousekeeper Senhora Felippa) in the season when all the population of\r\nthe villages turns out to dig up turtle eggs, and revel on the praias.\r\nPlacards were posted on the church doors at Ega, announcing that the\r\nexcavation on Shimuní would commence on the 17th of October, and on\r\nCatuá, sixty miles below Shimuní, on the 25th. We set out on the 16th,\r\nand passed on the road, in our well-manned igarité, a large number of\r\npeople, men, women, and children in canoes of all sizes, wending their\r\nway as if to a great holiday gathering. By the morning of the 17th,\r\nsome 400 persons were assembled on the borders of the sand-bank; each\r\nfamily having erected a rude temporary shed of poles and palm leaves to\r\nprotect themselves from the sun and rain. Large copper kettles to\r\nprepare the oil, and hundreds of red earthenware jars, were scattered\r\nabout on the sand.\r\n\r\nThe excavation of the taboleiro, collecting the eggs and purifying the\r\noil, occupied four days. All was done on a system established by the\r\nold Portuguese governors, probably more than a century ago. The\r\ncommandante first took down the names of all the masters of households,\r\nwith the number of persons each intended to employ in digging; he then\r\nexacted a payment of 140 reis (about fourpence) a head, towards\r\ndefraying the expense of sentinels. The whole were then allowed to go\r\nto the taboleiro. They arranged themselves around the circle, each\r\nperson armed with a paddle to be used as a spade, and then all began\r\nsimultaneously to dig on a signal being given—the roll of drums—by\r\norder of the commandante. It was an animating sight to behold the wide\r\ncircle of rival diggers throwing up clouds of sand in their energetic\r\nlabours, and working gradually towards the centre of the ring. A little\r\nrest was taken during the great heat of midday, and in the evening the\r\neggs were carried to the huts in baskets. By the end of the second day,\r\nthe taboleiro was exhausted; large mounds of eggs, some of them four to\r\nfive feet in height, were then seen by the side of each hut, the\r\nproduce of the labours of the family.\r\n\r\nIn the hurry of digging, some of the deeper nests are passed over; to\r\nfind these out, the people go about provided with a long steel or\r\nwooden probe, the presence of the eggs being discoverable by the ease\r\nwith which the spit enters the sand. When no more eggs are to be found,\r\nthe mashing process begins. The egg, it may be mentioned, has a\r\nflexible or leathery shell; it is quite round, and somewhat larger than\r\na hen’s egg. The whole heap is thrown into an empty canoe and mashed\r\nwith wooden prongs; but sometimes naked Indians and children jump into\r\nthe mass and tread it down, besmearing themselves with yolk and making\r\nabout as filthy a scene as can well be imagined. This being finished,\r\nwater is poured into the canoe, and the fatty mess then left for a few\r\nhours to be heated by the sun, on which the oil separates and rises to\r\nthe surface. The floating oil is afterwards skimmed off with long\r\nspoons, made by tying large mussel-shells to the end of rods, and\r\npurified over the fire in copper kettles.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of turtle eggs every year by these proceedings is\r\nenormous. At least 6000 jars, holding each three gallons of the oil,\r\nare exported annually from the Upper Amazons and the Madeira to Pará,\r\nwhere it is used for lighting, frying fish, and other purposes. It may\r\nbe fairly estimated that 2000 more jars-full are consumed by the\r\ninhabitants of the villages on the river. Now, it takes at least twelve\r\nbasketsful of eggs, or about 6000 by the wasteful process followed, to\r\nmake one jar of oil. The total number of eggs annually destroyed\r\namounts, therefore, to 48,000,000. As each turtle lays about 120, it\r\nfollows that the yearly offspring of 400,000 turtles is thus\r\nannihilated. A vast number, nevertheless, remain undetected; and these\r\nwould probably be sufficient to keep the turtle population of these\r\nrivers up to the mark, if the people did not follow the wasteful\r\npractice of lying in wait for the newly-hatched young, and collecting\r\nthem by thousands for eating; their tender flesh and the remains of\r\nyolk in their entrails being considered a great delicacy. The chief\r\nnatural enemies of the turtle are vultures and alligators, which devour\r\nthe newly-hatched young as they descend in shoals to the water. These\r\nmust have destroyed an immensely greater number before the European\r\nsettlers began to appropriate the eggs than they do now. It is almost\r\ndoubtful if this natural persecution did not act as effectively in\r\nchecking the increase of the turtle as the artificial destruction now\r\ndoes. If we are to believe the tradition of the Indians, however, it\r\nhad not this result; for they say that formerly the waters teemed as\r\nthickly with turtles as the air now does with mosquitoes. The universal\r\nopinion of the settlers on the Upper Amazons is, that the turtle has\r\nvery greatly decreased in numbers, and is still annually decreasing.\r\n\r\nWe left Shimuní on the 20th with quite a flotilla of canoes, and\r\ndescended the river to Catuá, an eleven hours’ journey by paddle and\r\ncurrent. Catuá is about six miles long, and almost entirely encircled\r\nby its praia. The turtles had selected for their egg-laying a part of\r\nthe sand-bank which was elevated at least twenty feet above the present\r\nlevel of the river; the animals, to reach the place, must have crawled\r\nup a slope. As we approached the island, numbers of the animals were\r\nseen coming to the surface to breathe, in a small shoaly bay. Those who\r\nhad light montarias sped forward with bows and arrows to shoot them.\r\nCarepíra was foremost, having borrowed a small and very unsteady boat,\r\nof Cardozo, and embarked in it with his little son. After bagging a\r\ncouple of turtles, and whilst hauling in a third, he overbalanced\r\nhimself; the canoe went over, and he with his child had to swim for\r\ntheir lives in the midst of numerous alligators, about a mile from the\r\nland. The old man had to sustain a heavy fire of jokes from his\r\ncompanions for several days after this mishap. Such accidents are only\r\nlaughed at by this almost amphibious people.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons congregated on Catuá was much greater than on\r\nShimuní, as the population of the banks of several neighbouring lakes\r\nwere here added. The line of huts and sheds extended half a mile, and\r\nseveral large sailing vessels were anchored at the place. The\r\ncommandante was Senhor Macedo, the Indian blacksmith of Ega before\r\nmentioned, who maintained excellent order during the fourteen days the\r\nprocess of excavation and oil manufacture lasted. There were also many\r\nprimitive Indians here from the neighbouring rivers, amongst them a\r\nfamily of Shumánas, good-tempered, harmless people from the Lower\r\nJapurá. All of them were tattooed around the mouth, the bluish tint\r\nforming a border to the lips, and extending in a line on the cheeks\r\ntowards the ear on each side. They were not quite so slender in figure\r\nas the Passés of Perdo-uassú’s family; but their features deviated\r\nquite as much as those of the Passés from the ordinary Indian type.\r\nThis was seen chiefly in the comparatively small mouth, pointed chin,\r\nthin lips, and narrow, high nose. One of the daughters, a young girl of\r\nabout seventeen years of age, was a real beauty. The colour of her skin\r\napproached the light tanned shade of the Mameluco women; her figure was\r\nalmost faultless, and the blue mouth, instead of being a disfigurement,\r\ngave quite a captivating finish to her appearance. Her neck, wrists,\r\nand ankles were adorned with strings of blue beads. She was, however,\r\nextremely bashful, never venturing to look strangers in the face, and\r\nnever quitting, for many minutes together, the side of her father and\r\nmother. The family had been shamefully swindled by some rascally trader\r\non another praia; and, on our arrival, came to lay their case before\r\nSenhor Cardozo, as the delegado of police of the district. The mild way\r\nin which the old man, without a trace of anger, stated his complaint in\r\nimperfect Tupi quite enlisted our sympathies in his favour. But Cardozo\r\ncould give him no redress; he invited the family, however, to make\r\ntheir rancho near to ours, and in the end gave them the highest price\r\nfor the surplus oil which they manufactured.\r\n\r\nIt was not all work at Catuá; indeed there was rather more play than\r\nwork going on. The people make a kind of holiday of these occasions.\r\nEvery fine night parties of the younger people assembled on the sands,\r\nand dancing and games were carried on for hours together. But the\r\nrequisite liveliness for these sports was never got up without a good\r\ndeal of preliminary rum-drinking. The girls were so coy that the young\r\nmen could not get sufficient partners for the dances without first\r\nsubscribing for a few flagons of the needful cashaca. The coldness of\r\nthe shy Indian and Mameluco maidens never failed to give way after a\r\nlittle of this strong drink, but it was astonishing what an immense\r\ndeal they could take of it in the course of an evening. Coyness is not\r\nalways a sign of innocence in these people, for most of the half-caste\r\nwomen on the Upper Amazons lead a little career of looseness before\r\nthey marry and settle down for life; and it is rather remarkable that\r\nthe men do not seem to object much to their brides having had a child\r\nor two by various fathers before marriage. The women do not lose\r\nreputation unless they become utterly depraved, but in that case they\r\nare condemned pretty strongly by public opinion. Depravity is, however,\r\nrare, for all require more or less to be wooed before they are won. I\r\ndid not see (although I mixed pretty freely with the young people) any\r\nbreach of propriety on the praias. The merry-makings were carried on\r\nnear the ranchos, where the more staid citizens of Ega, husbands with\r\ntheir wives and young daughters, all smoking gravely out of long pipes,\r\nsat in their hammocks and enjoyed the fun. Towards midnight we often\r\nheard, in the intervals between jokes and laughter, the hoarse roar of\r\njaguars prowling about the jungle in the middle of the praia. There\r\nwere several guitar-players amongst the young men, and one most\r\npersevering fiddler, so there was no lack of music.\r\n\r\nThe favourite sport was the Pira-purasséya, or fish-dance, one of the\r\noriginal games of the Indians, though now probably a little modified.\r\nThe young men and women, mingling together, formed a ring, leaving one\r\nof their number in the middle, who represented the fish. They then all\r\nmarched round, Indian file, the musicians mixed up with the rest,\r\nsinging a monotonous but rather pretty chorus, the words of which were\r\ninvented (under a certain form) by one of the party who acted as\r\nleader. This finished, all joined hands, and questions were put to the\r\none in the middle, asking what kind of fish he or she might be. To\r\nthese the individual has to reply. The end of it all is that he makes a\r\nrush at the ring, and if he succeeds in escaping, the person who\r\nallowed him to do so has to take his place; the march and chorus then\r\nrecommences, and so the game goes on hour after hour. Tupí was the\r\nlanguage mostly used, but sometimes Portuguese was sung and spoken. The\r\ndetails of the dance were often varied. Instead of the names of fishes\r\nbeing called over by the person in the middle, the name of some animal,\r\nflower, or other object was given to every fresh occupier of the place.\r\nThere was then good scope for wit in the invention of nicknames, and\r\npeals of laughter would often salute some particularly good hit. Thus a\r\nvery lanky young man was called the Magoary, or the grey stork; a moist\r\ngrey-eyed man with a profile comically suggestive of a fish was\r\nchristened Jarakí (a kind of fish), which was considered quite a witty\r\nsally; a little Mameluco girl, with light-coloured eyes and brown hair,\r\ngot the gallant name of Rosa Blanca, or the white rose; a young fellow\r\nwho had recently singed his eyebrows by the explosion of fireworks, was\r\ndubbed Pedro queimado (burnt Peter); in short every one got a nickname,\r\nand each time the cognomen was introduced into the chorus as the circle\r\nmarched round.\r\n\r\nOur rancho was a large one, and was erected in a line with the others\r\nnear the edge of the sand-bank which sloped rather abruptly to the\r\nwater. During the first week the people were all, more or less,\r\ntroubled by alligators. Some half-dozen full-grown ones were in\r\nattendance off the praia, floating about on the lazily-flowing, muddy\r\nwater. The dryness of the weather had increased since we had left\r\nShimuní, the currents had slackened, and the heat in the middle part of\r\nthe day was almost insupportable. But no one could descend to bathe\r\nwithout being advanced upon by one or other of these hungry monsters.\r\nThere was much offal cast into the river, and this, of course,\r\nattracted them to the place. One day I amused myself by taking a\r\nbasketful of fragments of meat beyond the line of ranchos, and drawing\r\nthe alligators towards me by feeding them. They behaved pretty much as\r\ndogs do when fed; catching the bones I threw them in their huge jaws,\r\nand coming nearer and showing increased eagerness after every morsel.\r\nThe enormous gape of their mouths, with their blood-red lining and long\r\nfringes of teeth, and the uncouth shapes of their bodies, made a\r\npicture of unsurpassable ugliness. I once or twice fired a heavy charge\r\nof shot at them, aiming at the vulnerable part of their bodies, which\r\nis a small space situated behind the eyes, but this had no other effect\r\nthan to make them give a hoarse grunt and shake themselves; they\r\nimmediately afterwards turned to receive another bone which I threw to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight adventure with alligator.\r\n\r\nEvery day these visitors became bolder; at length they reached a pitch\r\nof impudence that was quite intolerable. Cardozo had a poodle dog named\r\nCarlito, which some grateful traveller whom he had befriended had sent\r\nhim from Rio Janeiro. He took great pride in this dog, keeping it well\r\nsheared, and preserving his coat as white as soap and water could make\r\nit. We slept in our rancho in hammocks slung between the outer posts; a\r\nlarge wood fire (fed with a kind of wood abundant on the banks of the\r\nriver, which keeps alight all night) being made in the middle, by the\r\nside of which slept Carlito on a little mat. Well, one night I was\r\nawoke by a great uproar. It was caused by Cardozo hurling burning\r\nfirewood with loud curses at a huge cayman which had crawled up the\r\nbank and passed beneath my hammock (being nearest the water) towards\r\nthe place where Carlito lay. The dog had raised the alarm in time; the\r\nreptile backed out and tumbled down the bank to the water, the sparks\r\nfrom the brands hurled at him flying from his bony hide. To our great\r\nsurprise the animal (we supposed it to be the same individual) repeated\r\nhis visit the very next night, this time passing round to the other\r\nside of our shed. Cardozo was awake, and threw a harpoon at him, but\r\nwithout doing him any harm. After this it was thought necessary to make\r\nan effort to check the alligators; a number of men were therefore\r\npersuaded to sally forth in their montarias and devote a day to killing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe young men made several hunting excursions during the fourteen days\r\nof our stay on Catuá, and I, being associated with them in all their\r\npleasures, made generally one of the party. These were, besides, the\r\nsole occasions on which I could add to my collections, whilst on these\r\nbarren sands. Only two of these trips afforded incidents worth\r\nrelating.\r\n\r\nThe first, which was made to the interior of the wooded island of\r\nCatuá, was not a very successful one. We were twelve in number, all\r\narmed with guns and long hunting-knives. Long before sunrise, my\r\nfriends woke me up from my hammock, where I lay, as usual, in the\r\nclothes worn during the day; and after taking each a cup-full of\r\ncashaça and ginger (a very general practice in early morning on the\r\nsand-banks), we commenced our walk. The waning moon still lingered in\r\nthe clear sky, and a profound stillness pervaded sleeping camp, forest,\r\nand stream. Along the line of ranchos glimmered the fires made by each\r\nparty to dry turtle-eggs for food, the eggs being spread on little\r\nwooden stages over the smoke. The distance to the forest from our place\r\nof starting was about two miles, being nearly the whole length of the\r\nsand-bank, which was also a very broad one; the highest part, where it\r\nwas covered with a thicket of dwarf willows, mimosas, and arrow grass,\r\nlying near the ranchos. We loitered much on the way, and the day dawned\r\nwhilst we were yet on the road, the sand at this early hour feeling\r\nquite cold to the naked feet. As soon as we were able to distinguish\r\nthings, the surface of the praia was seen to be dotted with small black\r\nobjects. These were newly-hatched Aiyussa turtles, which were making\r\ntheir way in an undeviating line to the water, at least a mile distant.\r\nThe young animal of this species is distinguishable from that of the\r\nlarge turtle and the Tracaja, by the edges of the breast-plate being\r\nraised on each side, so that in crawling it scores two parallel lines\r\non the sand. The mouths of these little creatures were full of sand, a\r\ncircumstance arising from their having to bite their way through many\r\ninches of superincumbent sand to reach the surface on emerging from the\r\nburied eggs. It was amusing to observe how constantly they turned again\r\nin the direction of the distant river, after being handled and set down\r\non the sand with their heads facing the opposite quarter. We saw also\r\nseveral skeletons of the large cayman (some with the horny and bony\r\nhide of the animal nearly perfect) embedded in the sand; they reminded\r\nme of the remains of Ichthyosauri fossilised in beds of lias, with the\r\ndifference of being buried in fine sand instead of in blue mud. I\r\nmarked the place of one which had a well-preserved skull, and the next\r\nday returned to secure it. The specimen is now in the British Museum\r\ncollection. There were also many footmarks of jaguars on the sand.\r\n\r\nWe entered the forest, as the sun peeped over the tree-tops far away\r\ndown river. The party soon after divided, I keeping with a section\r\nwhich was led by Bento, the Ega carpenter, a capital woodsman. After a\r\nshort walk we struck the banks of a beautiful little lake, having\r\ngrassy margins and clear dark water, on the surface of which floated\r\nthick beds of water-lilies. We then crossed a muddy creek or\r\nwatercourse that entered the lake, and then found ourselves on a\r\n_restinga_, or tongue of land between two waters. By keeping in sight\r\nof one or the other of these, there was no danger of our losing our\r\nway: all other precautions were therefore unnecessary. The forest was\r\ntolerably clear of underwood, and consequently, easy to walk through.\r\nWe had not gone far before a soft, long-drawn whistle was heard aloft\r\nin the trees, betraying the presence of Mutums (Curassow birds). The\r\ncrowns of the trees, a hundred feet or more over our heads, were so\r\nclosely interwoven that it was difficult to distinguish the birds: the\r\npractised eye of Bento, however, made them out, and a fine male was\r\nshot from the flock, the rest flying away and alighting at no great\r\ndistance. The species was the one of which the male has a round red\r\nball on its beak (Crax globicera). The pursuit of the others led us a\r\ngreat distance, straight towards the interior of the island, in which\r\ndirection we marched for three hours, having the lake always on our\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\nUmbrella Bird.\r\n\r\nArriving at length at the head of the lake, Bento struck off to the\r\nleft across the restinga, and we then soon came upon a treeless space\r\nchoked up with tall grass, which appeared to be the dried-up bed of\r\nanother lake. Our leader was obliged to climb a tree to ascertain our\r\nposition, and found that the clear space was part of the creek, whose\r\nmouth we had crossed lower down. The banks were clothed with low trees,\r\nnearly all of one species, a kind of araca (Psidium), and the ground\r\nwas carpeted with a slender delicate grass, now in flower. A great\r\nnumber of crimson and vermilion-coloured butterflies (Catagramma\r\nPeristera, male and female) were settled on the smooth, white trunks of\r\nthese trees. I had also here the great pleasure of seeing for the first\r\ntime, the rare and curious Umbrella Bird (Cephalopterus ornatus), a\r\nspecies which resembles in size, colour, and appearance our common\r\ncrow, but is decorated with a crest of long, curved, hairy feathers\r\nhaving long bare quills, which, when raised, spread themselves out in\r\nthe form of a fringed sunshade over the head. A strange ornament, like\r\na pelerine, is also suspended from the neck, formed by a thick pad of\r\nglossy steel-blue feathers, which grow on a long fleshy lobe or\r\nexcrescence. This lobe is connected (as I found on skinning specimens)\r\nwith an unusual development of the trachea and vocal organs, to which\r\nthe bird doubtless owes its singularly deep, loud, and long-sustained\r\nfluty note. The Indian name of this strange creature is Uirá-mimbéu, or\r\nfife-bird,[4] in allusion to the tone of its voice. We had the good\r\nluck, after remaining quiet a short time, to hear its performance. It\r\ndrew itself up on its perch, spread widely the umbrella-formed crest,\r\ndilated and waved its glossy breast-lappet, and then, in giving vent to\r\nits loud piping note, bowed its head slowly forwards. We obtained a\r\npair, male and female; the female has only the rudiments of the crest\r\nand lappet, and is duller-coloured altogether than the male. The range\r\nof this bird appears to be quite confined to the plains of the Upper\r\nAmazons (especially the Ygapó forests), not having been found to the\r\neast of the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\n [4] Mimbéu is the Indian name for a rude kind of pan-pipes used by the\r\n Caishânas and other tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBento and our other friends being disappointed in finding no more\r\nCurassows, or indeed any other species of game, now resolved to turn\r\nback. On reaching the edge of the forest, we sat down and ate our\r\ndinners under the shade; each man having brought a little bag\r\ncontaining a few handsfull of farinha, and a piece of fried fish or\r\nroast turtle. We expected our companions of the other division to join\r\nus at midday, but after waiting till past one o’clock without seeing\r\nanything of them (in fact, they had returned to the huts an hour or two\r\npreviously), we struck off across the praia towards the encampment. An\r\nobstacle here presented itself on which we had not counted. The sun had\r\nshone all day through a cloudless sky untempered by a breath of wind,\r\nand the sands had become heated by it to a degree that rendered walking\r\nover them with our bare feet impossible. The most hardened footsoles of\r\nthe party could not endure the burning soil. We made several attempts;\r\nwe tried running, having wrapped the cool leaves of Heliconiæ round our\r\nfeet, but in no way could we step forward many yards. There was no\r\nmeans of getting back to our friends before night, except going round\r\nthe praia, a circuit of about four miles, and walking through the water\r\nor on the moist sand. To get to the waterside from the place where we\r\nthen stood was not difficult, as a thick bed of a flowering shrub,\r\ncalled tintarána, an infusion of the leaves of which is used to dye\r\nblack, lay on that side of the sand-bank. Footsore and wearied,\r\nburthened with our guns, and walking for miles through the tepid\r\nshallow water under the brain-scorching vertical sun, we had, as may be\r\nimagined, anything but a pleasant time of it. I did not, however, feel\r\nany inconvenience afterwards. Everyone enjoys the most lusty health\r\nwhilst living this free and wild life on the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe other hunting trip which I have alluded to was undertaken in\r\ncompany with three friendly young half-castes. Two of them were\r\nbrothers, namely, Joao (John) and Zephyrino Jabutí: Jabutí, or\r\ntortoise, being a nickname which their father had earned for his slow\r\ngait, and which, as is usual in this country, had descended as the\r\nsurname of the family. The other was José Frazao, a nephew of Senhor\r\nChrysostomo, of Ega, an active, clever, and manly young fellow, whom I\r\nmuch esteemed. He was almost a white, his father being a Portuguese and\r\nhis mother a Mameluca. We were accompanied by an Indian named Lino, and\r\na Mulatto boy, whose office was to carry our game.\r\n\r\nOur proposed hunting-ground on this occasion lay across the water,\r\nabout fifteen miles distant. We set out in a small montaria, at four\r\no’clock in the morning, again leaving the encampment asleep, and\r\ntravelled at a good pace up the northern channel of the Solimoens, or\r\nthat lying between the island Catuá and the left bank of the river. The\r\nnorthern shore of the island had a broad sandy beach reaching to its\r\nwestern extremity. We gained our destination a little after daybreak;\r\nthis was the banks of the Carapanatúba,[5] a channel some 150 yards in\r\nwidth, which, like the Ananá already mentioned, communicates with the\r\nCupiyó. To reach this we had to cross the river, here nearly two miles\r\nwide. Just as day dawned we saw a Cayman seize a large fish, a Tambakí,\r\nnear the surface; the reptile seemed to have a difficulty in securing\r\nits prey, for it reared itself above the water, tossing the fish in its\r\njaws and making a tremendous commotion. I was much struck also by the\r\nsingular appearance presented by certain diving birds having very long\r\nand snaky necks (the Plotus Anhinga). Occasionally a long serpentine\r\nform would suddenly wriggle itself to a height of a foot and a half\r\nabove the glassy surface of the water, producing such a deceptive\r\nimitation of a snake that at first I had some difficulty in believing\r\nit to be the neck of a bird; it did not remain long in view, but soon\r\nplunged again beneath the stream.\r\n\r\n [5] Meaning, in Tupí, the river of many mosquitoes: from carapaná,\r\n mosquito, and itúba, many.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ran ashore in a most lonely and gloomy place, on a low sand-bank\r\ncovered with bushes, secured the montaria to a tree, and then, after\r\nmaking a very sparing breakfast on fried fish and mandioca meal, rolled\r\nup our trousers and plunged into the thick forest, which here, as\r\neverywhere else, rose like a lofty wall of foliage from the narrow\r\nstrip of beach. We made straight for the heart of the land, John Jabutí\r\nleading, and breaking off at every few steps a branch of the lower\r\ntrees, so that we might recognise the path on our return. The district\r\nwas quite new to all my companions, and being on a coast almost totally\r\nuninhabited by human beings for some 300 miles, to lose our way would\r\nhave been to perish helplessly. I did not think at the time of the risk\r\nwe ran of having our canoe stolen by passing Indians, unguarded\r\nmontarias being never safe even in the ports of the villages, Indians\r\napparently considering them common property, and stealing them without\r\nany compunction. No misgivings clouded the lightness of heart with\r\nwhich we trod forward in warm anticipation of a good day’s sport.\r\n\r\nThe tract of forest through which we passed was Ygapó, but the higher\r\nparts of the land formed areas which went only a very few inches under\r\nwater in the flood season. It consisted of a most bewildering diversity\r\nof grand and beautiful trees, draped, festooned, corded, matted, and\r\nribboned with climbing plants, woody and succulent, in endless variety.\r\nThe most prevalent palm was the tall Astryocaryum Jauarí, whose fallen\r\nspines made it necessary to pick our way carefully over the ground, as\r\nwe were all barefooted. There was not much green underwood, except in\r\nplaces where Bamboos grew; these formed impenetrable thickets of plumy\r\nfoliage and thorny, jointed stems, which always compelled us to make a\r\ncircuit to avoid them. The earth elsewhere was encumbered with rotting\r\nfruits, gigantic bean-pods, leaves, limbs, and trunks of trees; fixing\r\nthe impression of its being the cemetery as well as the birthplace of\r\nthe great world of vegetation overhead. Some of the trees were of\r\nprodigious height. We passed many specimens of the Moratinga, whose\r\ncylindrical trunks, I dare not say how many feet in circumference,\r\ntowered up and were lost amidst the crowns of the lower trees, their\r\nlower branches, in some cases, being hidden from our view. Another very\r\nlarge and remarkable tree was the Assacú (Sapium aucuparium). A\r\ntraveller on the Amazons, mingling with the people, is sure to hear\r\nmuch of the poisonous qualities of the juices of this tree. Its bark\r\nexudes, when hacked with a knife, a milky sap, which is not only a\r\nfatal poison when taken internally, but is said to cause incurable\r\nsores if simply sprinkled on the skin. My companions always gave the\r\nAssacú a wide berth when we passed one. The tree looks ugly enough to\r\nmerit a bad name, for the bark is of a dingy olive colour, and is\r\nstudded with short and sharp, venomous-looking spines.\r\n\r\nAfter walking about half a mile we came upon a dry watercourse, where\r\nwe observed, first, the old footmarks of a tapir, and, soon after, on\r\nthe margin of a curious circular hole full of muddy water, the fresh\r\ntracks of a Jaguar. This latter discovery was hardly made when a rush\r\nwas heard amidst the bushes on the top of a sloping bank on the\r\nopposite side of the dried creek. We bounded forward; it was, however,\r\ntoo late, for the animal had sped in a few minutes far out of our\r\nreach. It was clear we had disturbed, on our approach, the Jaguar,\r\nwhilst quenching his thirst at the water-hole. A few steps further on\r\nwe saw the mangled remains of an alligator (the Jacarétinga). The head,\r\nfore-quarters, and bony shell were the only parts which remained; but\r\nthe meat was quite fresh, and there were many footmarks of the Jaguar\r\naround the carcase; so that there was no doubt this had formed the\r\nsolid part of the animal’s breakfast. My companions now began to search\r\nfor the alligator’s nest, the presence of the reptile so far from the\r\nriver being accountable for on no other ground than its maternal\r\nsolicitude for its eggs. We found, in fact, the nest at the distance of\r\na few yards from the place. It was a conical pile of dead leaves, in\r\nthe middle of which twenty eggs were buried. These were of elliptical\r\nshape, considerably larger than those of a duck, and having a hard\r\nshell of the texture of porcelain, but very rough on the outside. They\r\nmake a loud sound when rubbed together, and it is said that it is easy\r\nto find a mother alligator in the Ygapó forests by rubbing together two\r\neggs in this way, she being never far off, and attracted by the sounds.\r\n\r\nI put half-a-dozen of the alligator’s eggs in my game-bag for\r\nspecimens, and we then continued on our way. Lino, who was now first,\r\npresently made a start backwards, calling out “Jararáca!” This is the\r\nname of a poisonous snake (genus Craspedocephalus), which is far more\r\ndreaded by the natives than Jaguar or Alligator. The individual seen by\r\nLino lay coiled up at the foot of a tree, and was scarcely\r\ndistinguishable, on account of the colours of its body being\r\nassimilated to those of the fallen leaves. Its hideous, flat triangular\r\nhead, connected with the body by a thin neck, was reared and turned\r\ntowards us: Frazao killed it with a charge of shot, shattering it\r\ncompletely, and destroying, to my regret, its value as a specimen. In\r\nconversing on the subject of Jararácas as we walked onwards, every one\r\nof the party was ready to swear that this snake attacks man without\r\nprovocation, leaping towards him from a considerable distance when he\r\napproaches. I met, in the course of my daily rambles in the woods, many\r\nJararácas, and once or twice narrowly very escaped treading on them,\r\nbut never saw them attempt to spring. On some subjects the testimony of\r\nthe natives of a wild country is utterly worthless. The bite of the\r\nJararácas is generally fatal. I knew of four or five instances of death\r\nfrom it, and only of one clear case of recovery after being bitten; but\r\nin that case the person was lamed for life.\r\n\r\nWe walked over moderately elevated and dry ground for about a mile, and\r\nthen descended (three or four feet only) to the dry bed of another\r\ncreek. This was pierced in the same way as the former water-course,\r\nwith round holes full of muddy water. They occurred at intervals of a\r\nfew yards, and had the appearance of having been made by the hand of\r\nman. The smallest were about two feet, the largest seven or eight feet\r\nin diameter. As we approached the most extensive of the larger ones, I\r\nwas startled at seeing a number of large serpent-like heads bobbing\r\nabout the surface. They proved to be those of electric eels, and it now\r\noccurred to me that the round holes were made by these animals working\r\nconstantly round and round in the moist, muddy soil. Their depth (some\r\nof them were at least eight feet deep) was doubtless due also to the\r\nmovements of the eels in the soft soil, and accounted for their not\r\ndrying up, in the fine season, with the rest of the creek. Thus, whilst\r\nalligators and turtles in this great inundated forest region retire to\r\nthe larger pools during the dry season, the electric eels make for\r\nthemselves little ponds in which to pass the season of drought.\r\n\r\nMy companions now cut each a stout pole, and proceeded to eject the\r\neels in order to get at the other fishes, with which they had\r\ndiscovered the ponds to abound. I amused them all very much by showing\r\nhow the electric shock from the eels could pass from one person to\r\nanother. We joined hands in a line whilst I touched the biggest and\r\nfreshest of the animals on the head with the point of my hunting-knife.\r\nWe found that this experiment did not succeed more than three times\r\nwith the same eel when out of the water; for, the fourth time the shock\r\nwas scarcely perceptible. All the fishes found in the holes (besides\r\nthe eels) belonged to one species, a small kind of Acari, or Loricaria,\r\na group whose members have a complete bony integument. Lino and the boy\r\nstrung them together through the gills with slender sipós, and hung\r\nthem on the trees to await our return later in the day.\r\n\r\nLeaving the bed of the creek, we marched onwards, always towards the\r\ncentre of the land, guided by the sun, which now glimmered through the\r\nthick foliage overhead. About eleven o’clock we saw a break in the\r\nforest before us, and presently emerged on the banks of a rather large\r\nsheet of water. This was one of the interior pools of which there are\r\nso many in this district. The margins were elevated some few feet, and\r\nsloped down to the water, the ground being hard and dry to the water’s\r\nedge, and covered with shrubby vegetation. We passed completely round\r\nthis pool, finding the crowns of the trees on its borders tenanted by\r\ncurassow birds, whose presence was betrayed as usual by the peculiar\r\nnote which they emit. My companions shot two of them. At the further\r\nend of the lake lay a deep watercourse, which we traced for about half\r\na mile, and found to communicate with another and smaller pool. This\r\nsecond one evidently swarmed with turtles, as we saw the snouts of many\r\npeering above the surface of the water: the same had not been seen in\r\nthe larger lake, probably because we had made too much noise in hailing\r\nour discovery on approaching its banks. My friends made an arrangement\r\non the spot for returning to this pool, after the termination of the\r\negg harvest on Catuá.\r\n\r\nIn recrossing the space between the two pools, we heard the crash of\r\nmonkeys in the crowns of trees overhead. The chase of these occupied us\r\na considerable time. José fired at length at one of the laggards of the\r\ntroop, and wounded him. He climbed pretty nimbly towards a denser part\r\nof the tree, and a second and third discharge failed to bring him down.\r\nThe poor maimed creature then trailed his limbs to one of the topmost\r\nbranches, where we descried him soon after, seated and picking the\r\nentrails from a wound in his abdomen; a most heart-rending sight. The\r\nheight from the ground to the bough on which he was perched could not\r\nhave been less than 150 feet, and we could get a glimpse of him only by\r\nstanding directly underneath, and straining our eyes upwards. We killed\r\nhim at last by loading our best gun with a careful charge, and resting\r\nthe barrel against the tree-trunk to steady the aim. A few shots\r\nentered his chin, and he then fell heels over head screaming to the\r\nground. Although it was I who gave the final shot, this animal did not\r\nfall to my lot in dividing the spoils at the end of the day. I regret\r\nnow not having preserved the skin, as it belonged to a very large\r\nspecies of Cebus, and one which I never met with afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was about one o’clock in the afternoon when we again reached the\r\nspot where we had first struck the banks of the larger pool. We\r\nhitherto had but poor sport, so after dining on the remains of our\r\nfried fish and farinha, and smoking our cigarettes, the apparatus for\r\nmaking which, including bamboo tinder-box and steel and flint for\r\nstriking a light, being carried by every one always on these\r\nexpeditions, we made off in another (westerly) direction through the\r\nforest to try to find better hunting-ground. We quenched our thirst\r\nwith water from the pool, which I was rather surprised to find quite\r\npure. These pools are, of course, sometimes fouled for a time by the\r\nmovements of alligators and other tenants in the fine mud which settles\r\nat the bottom, but I never observed a scum of confervæ or traces of oil\r\nrevealing animal decomposition on the surface of these waters, nor was\r\nthere ever any foul smell perceptible. The whole of this level land,\r\ninstead of being covered with unwholesome swamps emitting malaria,\r\nforms in the dry season (and in the wet also) a most healthy country.\r\nHow elaborate must be the natural processes of self-purification in\r\nthese teeming waters!\r\n\r\nOn our fresh route we were obliged to cut our way through a long belt\r\nof bamboo underwood, and not being so careful of my steps as my\r\ncompanions, I trod repeatedly on the flinty thorns which had fallen\r\nfrom the bushes, finishing by becoming completely lame, one thorn\r\nhaving entered deeply the sole of my foot. I was obliged to be left\r\nbehind; Lino, the Indian, remaining with me. The careful fellow cleaned\r\nmy wounds with his saliva, placed pieces of isca (the felt-like\r\nsubstance manufactured by ants) on them to staunch the blood, and bound\r\nmy feet with tough bast to serve as shoes, which he cut from the bark\r\nof a Mongúba tree. He went about his work in a very gentle way and with\r\nmuch skill, but was so sparing of speech that I could scarcely get\r\nanswers to the questions I put to him. When he had done I was able to\r\nlimp about pretty nimbly. An Indian when he performs a service of this\r\nkind never thinks of a reward. I did not find so much disinterestedness\r\nin negro slaves or half-castes. We had to wait two hours for the return\r\nof our companions; during part of this time I was left quite alone,\r\nLino having started off into the jungle after a peccary (a kind of wild\r\nhog) which had come near to where we sat, but on seeing us had given a\r\ngrunt and bounded off into the thickets. At length our friends hove in\r\nsight, loaded with game; having shot twelve curassows and two cujubims\r\n(Penelope Pipile), a handsome black fowl with a white head, which is\r\narboreal in its habits like the rest of this group of Gallinaceous\r\nbirds inhabiting the South American forests. They had discovered a\r\nthird pool containing plenty of turtles. Lino rejoined us at the same\r\ntime, having missed the peccary, but in compensation shot a Quandú, or\r\nporcupine. The mulatto boy had caught alive in the pool a most charming\r\nlittle water-fowl, a species of grebe. It was somewhat smaller than a\r\npigeon, and had a pointed beak; its feet were furnished with many\r\nintricate folds or frills of skin instead of webs, and resembled very\r\nmuch those of the gecko lizards. The bird was kept as a pet in Jabutí’s\r\nhouse at Ega for a long time afterwards, where it became accustomed to\r\nswim about in a common hand-basin full of water, and was a great\r\nfavourite with everybody.\r\n\r\nWe now retraced our steps towards the water-side, a weary walk of five\r\nor six miles, reaching our canoe by half-past five o’clock, or a little\r\nbefore sunset. It was considered by everyone at Catuá that we had had\r\nan unusually good day’s sport. I never knew any small party to take so\r\nmuch game in one day in these forests, over which animals are\r\neverywhere so widely and sparingly scattered. My companions were\r\ngreatly elated, and on approaching the encampment at Catuá, made a\r\ngreat commotion with their paddles to announce their successful return,\r\nsinging in their loudest key one of the wild choruses of the Amazonian\r\nboatmen.\r\n\r\nThe excavation of eggs and preparation of the oil being finished, we\r\nleft Catuá on the 3rd of November. Carepíra, who was now attached to\r\nCardozo’s party, had discovered another lake rich in turtles, about\r\ntwelve miles distant, in one of his fishing rambles, and my friend\r\nresolved, before returning to Ega, to go there with his nets and drag\r\nit as we had formerly done the Aningal. Several Mameluco families of\r\nEga begged to accompany us to share the labours and booty; the Shumána\r\nfamily also joined the party; we therefore, formed a large body,\r\nnumbering in all eight canoes and fifty persons.\r\n\r\nThe summer season was now breaking up; the river was rising; the sky\r\nwas almost constantly clouded, and we had frequent rains. The\r\nmosquitoes also, which we had not felt whilst encamped on the\r\nsand-banks, now became troublesome. We paddled up the north-westerly\r\nchannel, and arrived at a point near the upper end of Catuá at ten\r\no’clock p.m. There was here a very broad beach of untrodden white sand,\r\nwhich extended quite into the forest, where it formed rounded hills and\r\nhollows like sand dunes, covered with a peculiar vegetation: harsh,\r\nreedy grasses, and low trees matted together with lianas, and varied\r\nwith dwarf spiny palms of the genus Bactris. We encamped for the night\r\non the sands, finding the place luckily free from mosquitoes. The\r\ndifferent portions of the party made arched coverings with the toldos\r\nor maranta-leaf awnings of their canoes to sleep under, fixing the\r\nedges in the sand. No one, however, seemed inclined to go to sleep, so\r\nafter supper we all sat or lay around the large fires and amused\r\nourselves. We had the fiddler with us, and in the intervals between the\r\nwretched tunes which he played, the usual amusement of story-telling\r\nbeguiled the time: tales of hair-breadth escapes from jaguar,\r\nalligator, and so forth. There were amongst us a father and son who had\r\nbeen the actors, the previous year, in an alligator adventure on the\r\nedge of the praia we had just left. The son, whilst bathing, was seized\r\nby the thigh and carried under water: a cry was raised, and the father,\r\nrushing down the bank, plunged after the rapacious beast, which was\r\ndiving away with his victim. It seems almost incredible that a man\r\ncould overtake and master the large cayman in his own element; but such\r\nwas the case in this instance, for the animal was reached and forced to\r\nrelease his booty by the man’s thrusting his thumb into his eye. The\r\nlad showed us the marks of the alligator’s teeth on his thigh. We sat\r\nup until past midnight listening to these stories and assisting the\r\nflow of talk by frequent potations of burnt rum. A large, shallow dish\r\nwas filled with the liquor and fired; when it had burned for a few\r\nminutes, the flame was extinguished and each one helped himself by\r\ndipping a tea-cup into the vessel.\r\n\r\nOne by one the people dropped asleep, and then the quiet murmur of talk\r\nof the few who remained awake was interrupted by the roar of jaguars in\r\nthe jungle about a furlong distant. There was not one only, but several\r\nof the animals. The older men showed considerable alarm and proceeded\r\nto light fresh fires around the outside of our encampment. I had read\r\nin books of travel of tigers coming to warm themselves by the fires of\r\na bivouac, and thought my strong wish to witness the same sight would\r\nhave been gratified to-night. I had not, however, such good fortune,\r\nalthough I was the last to go to sleep, and my bed was the bare sand\r\nunder a little arched covering open at both ends. The jaguars,\r\nnevertheless, must have come very near during the night, for their\r\nfresh footmarks were numerous within a score yards of the place where\r\nwe slept. In the morning I had a ramble along the borders of the\r\njungle, and found the tracks very numerous and close together on the\r\nsandy soil.\r\n\r\nWe remained in this neighbourhood four days, and succeeded in obtaining\r\nmany hundred turtles, but we were obliged to sleep two nights within\r\nthe Carapanatúba channel. The first night passed rather pleasantly, for\r\nthe weather was fine, and we encamped in the forest, making large fires\r\nand slinging our hammocks between the trees. The second was one of the\r\nmost miserable nights I ever spent. The air was close, and a drizzling\r\nrain began to fall about midnight, lasting until morning. We tried at\r\nfirst to brave it out under the trees. Several very large fires were\r\nmade, lighting up with ruddy gleams the magnificent foliage in the\r\nblack shades around our encampment. The heat and smoke had the desired\r\neffect of keeping off pretty well the mosquitoes, but the rain\r\ncontinued until at length everything was soaked, and we had no help for\r\nit but to bundle off to the canoes with drenched hammocks and garments.\r\nThere was not nearly room enough in the flotilla to accommodate so\r\nlarge a number of persons lying at full length; moreover the night was\r\npitch dark, and it was quite impossible in the gloom and confusion to\r\nget at a change of clothing. So there we lay, huddled together in the\r\nbest way we could arrange ourselves, exhausted with fatigue and\r\nirritated beyond all conception by clouds of mosquitoes. I slept on a\r\nbench with a sail over me, my wet clothes clinging to my body, and to\r\nincrease my discomfort, close beside me lay an Indian girl, one of\r\nCardozo’s domestics, who had a skin disfigured with black diseased\r\npatches, and whose thick clothing, not having been washed during the\r\nwhole time we had been out (eighteen days), gave forth a most vile\r\neffluvium.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night of the 7th of November pleasantly on the smooth\r\nsands, where the jaguars again serenaded us, and on the succeeding\r\nmorning we commenced our return voyage to Ega. We first doubled the\r\nupper end of the island of Catuá, and then struck off for the right\r\nbank of the Solimoens. The river was here of immense width, and the\r\ncurrent was so strong in the middle that it required the most strenuous\r\nexertions on the part of our paddlers to prevent us from being carried\r\nmiles away down the stream. At night we reached the Juteca, a small\r\nriver which enters the Solimoens by a channel so narrow that a man\r\nmight almost jump across it, but a furlong inwards expands into a very\r\npretty lake several miles in circumference. We slept again in the\r\nforest, and again were annoyed by rain and mosquitoes; but this time\r\nCardozo and I preferred remaining where we were to mingling with the\r\nreeking crowd in the boats. When the grey dawn arose a steady rain was\r\nstill falling, and the whole sky had a settled, leaden appearance, but\r\nit was delightfully cool. We took our net into the lake and gleaned a\r\ngood supply of delicious fish for breakfast. I saw at the upper end of\r\nthis lake the native rice of this country growing wild.\r\n\r\nThe weather cleared up at ten o’clock a.m. At three p.m. we arrived at\r\nthe mouth of the Cayambé, another tributary stream much larger than the\r\nJuteca. The channel of exit to the Solimoens was here also very narrow,\r\nbut the expanded river inside is of vast dimensions: it forms a lake (I\r\nmay safely venture to say), several score miles in circumference.\r\nAlthough prepared for these surprises, I was quite taken aback in this\r\ncase. We had been paddling all day along a monotonous shore, with the\r\ndreary Solimoens before us, here three to four miles broad, heavily\r\nrolling onward its muddy waters. We come to a little gap in the earthy\r\nbanks, and find a dark, narrow inlet with a wall of forest\r\novershadowing it on each side; we enter it, and at a distance of two or\r\nthree hundred yards a glorious sheet of water bursts upon the view. The\r\nscenery of Cayambé is very picturesque. The land, on the two sides\r\nvisible of the lake, is high, and clothed with sombre woods, varied\r\nhere and there with a white-washed house, in the middle of a green\r\npatch of clearing, belonging to settlers. In striking contrast to these\r\ndark, rolling forests, is the vivid, light green and cheerful foliage\r\nof the woods on the numerous islets which rest like water-gardens on\r\nthe surface of the lake. Flocks of ducks, storks, and snow-white herons\r\ninhabit these islets, and a noise of parrots with the tingling chorus\r\nof Tamburí-parás was heard from them as we passed. This has a cheering\r\neffect after the depressing stillness and absence of life in the woods\r\non the margins of the main river.\r\n\r\nCardozo and I took a small boat and crossed the lake to visit one of\r\nthe settlers, and on our return to our canoe, whilst in the middle of\r\nthe lake, a squall suddenly arose in the direction towards which we\r\nwere going, so that for a whole hour we were in great danger of being\r\nswamped. The wind blew away the awning and mats, and lashed the waters\r\ninto foam, the waves rising to a great height. Our boat, fortunately,\r\nwas excellently constructed, rising well towards the prow, so that with\r\ngood steering we managed to head the billows as they arose, and escaped\r\nwithout shipping much water. We reached our igarité at sunset, and then\r\nmade all speed to Curubarú, fifteen miles distant, to encamp for the\r\nnight on the sands. We reached the praia at ten o’clock. The waters\r\nwere now mounting fast upon the sloping beach, and we found on dragging\r\nthe net next morning that fish was beginning to be scarce. Cardozo and\r\nhis friends talked quite gloomily at breakfast time over the departure\r\nof the joyous _verao_, and the setting in of the dull, hungry winter\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock in the morning of the 10th of November a light wind\r\nfrom down river sprang up, and all who had sails hoisted them. It was\r\nthe first time during our trip that we had had occasion to use our\r\nsails: so continual is the calm on this upper river. We bowled along\r\nmerrily, and soon entered the broad channel lying between Bariá and the\r\nmainland on the south bank. The wind carried us right into the mouth of\r\nthe Teffé and at four o’clock p.m. we cast anchor in the port of Ega.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\nANIMALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EGA\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlet-faced Monkeys — Parauacú Monkey — Owl-faced Night-apes —\r\nMarmosets — Jupurá — Bats — Birds — Cuvier’s Toucan — Curl-crested\r\nToucan — Insects — Pendulous Cocoons — Foraging Ants — Blind Ants.\r\n\r\nAs may have been gathered from the remarks already made, the\r\nneighbourhood of Ega was a fine field for a Natural History collector.\r\nWith the exception of what could be learned from the few specimens\r\nbrought home, after transient visits by Spix and Martius and the Count\r\nde Castelnau, whose acquisitions have been deposited in the public\r\nmuseums of Munich and Paris, very little was known in Europe of the\r\nanimal tenants of this region; the collections that I had the\r\nopportunity of making and sending home attracted, therefore,\r\nconsiderable attention. Indeed, the name of my favourite village has\r\nbecome quite a household word amongst a numerous class of Naturalists,\r\nnot only in England but abroad, in consequence of the very large number\r\nof new species (upwards of 3000) which they have had to describe, with\r\nthe locality “Ega” attached to them. The discovery of new species,\r\nhowever, forms but a small item in the interest belonging to the study\r\nof the living creation. The structure, habits, instincts, and\r\ngeographical distribution of some of the oldest-known forms supply\r\ninexhaustible materials for reflection. The few remarks I have to make\r\non the animals of Ega will relate to the mammals, birds, and insects,\r\nand will sometimes apply to the productions of the whole Upper Amazons\r\nregion. We will begin with the monkeys, the most interesting, next to\r\nman, of all animals.\r\n\r\n_Scarlet-faced Monkeys._—Early one sunny morning, in the year 1855, I\r\nsaw in the streets of Ega a number of Indians, carrying on their\r\nshoulders down to the port, to be embarked on the Upper Amazons\r\nsteamer, a large cage made of strong lianas, some twelve feet in length\r\nand five in height, containing a dozen monkeys of the most grotesque\r\nappearance. Their bodies (about eighteen inches in height, exclusive of\r\nlimbs) were clothed from neck to tail with very long, straight, and\r\nshining whitish hair; their heads were nearly bald, owing to the very\r\nshort crop of thin grey hairs, and their faces glowed with the most\r\nvivid scarlet hue. As a finish to their striking physiognomy, they had\r\nbushy whiskers of a sandy colour, meeting under the chin, and\r\nreddish-yellow eyes. These red-faced apes belonged to a species called\r\nby the Indians Uakarí, which is peculiar to the Ega district, and the\r\ncage with its contents was being sent as a present by Senhor\r\nChrysostomo, the Director of Indians of the Japura, to one of the\r\nGovernment officials at Rio Janeiro, in acknowledgment of having been\r\nmade colonel of the new National Guard. They had been obtained with\r\ngreat difficulty in the forests which cover the lowlands near the\r\nprincipal mouth of the Japura, about thirty miles from Ega. It was the\r\nfirst time I had seen this most curious of all the South American\r\nmonkeys, and one that appears to have escaped the notice of Spix and\r\nMartius. I afterwards made a journey to the district inhabited by it,\r\nbut did not then succeed in obtaining specimens; before leaving the\r\ncountry, however, I acquired two individuals, one of which lived in my\r\nhouse for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlet-faced and Parauacú Monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet-faced monkey belongs, in all essential points of structure,\r\nto the same family (Cebidæ) as the rest of the large-sized American\r\nspecies; but it differs from all its relatives in having only the\r\nrudiment of a tail, a member which reaches in some allied kinds the\r\nhighest grade of development known in the order. It was so unusual to\r\nsee a nearly tailless monkey from America, that naturalists thought,\r\nwhen the first specimens arrived in Europe, that the member had been\r\nshortened artificially. Nevertheless, the Uakarí is not quite isolated\r\nfrom its related species of the same family, several other kinds, also\r\nfound on the Amazons, forming a graduated passage between the extreme\r\nforms as regards the tail. The appendage reaches its perfection in\r\nthose genera (the Howlers, the Lagothrix and the Spider monkeys) in\r\nwhich it presents on its under-surface near the tip a naked palm, which\r\nmakes it sensitive and useful as a fifth hand in climbing. In the rest\r\nof the genera of Cebidæ (seven in number, containing thirty-eight\r\nspecies), the tail is weaker in structure, entirely covered with hair,\r\nand of little or no service in climbing, a few species nearly related\r\nto our Uakarí having it much shorter than usual. All the Cebidæ, both\r\nlong-tailed and short-tailed, are equally dwellers in trees. The\r\nscarlet-faced monkey lives in forests, which are inundated during great\r\npart of the year, and is never known to descend to the ground; the\r\nshortness of its tail is, therefore, no sign of terrestrial habits, as\r\nit is in the Macaques and Baboons of the Old World. It differs a little\r\nfrom the typical Cebidæ in its teeth, the incisors being oblique and,\r\nin the upper jaw, converging, so as to leave a gap between the\r\noutermost and the canine teeth. Like all the rest of its family, it\r\ndiffers from the monkeys of the Old World, and from man, in having an\r\nadditional grinding-tooth (premolar) in each side of both jaws, making\r\nthe complete set thirty-six instead of thirty-two in number.\r\n\r\nThe white Uakarí (Brachyurus calvus), seems to be found in no other\r\npart of America than the district just mentioned, namely, the banks of\r\nthe Japura, near its principal mouth; and even there it is confined, as\r\nfar I could learn, to the western side of the river. It lives in small\r\ntroops amongst the crowns of the lofty trees, subsisting on fruits of\r\nvarious kinds. Hunters say it is pretty nimble in its motions, but is\r\nnot much given to leaping, preferring to run up and down the larger\r\nboughs in travelling from tree to tree. The mother, as in other species\r\nof the monkey order, carries her young on her back. Individuals are\r\nobtained alive by shooting them with the blow-pipe and arrows tipped\r\nwith diluted Urarí poison. They run a considerable distance after being\r\npierced, and it requires an experienced hunter to track them. He is\r\nconsidered the most expert who can keep pace with a wounded one, and\r\ncatch it in his arms when it falls exhausted. A pinch of salt, the\r\nantidote to the poison, is then put in its mouth, and the creature\r\nrevives. The species is rare, even in the limited district which it\r\ninhabits. Senhor Chrysostomo sent six of his most skilful Indians, who\r\nwere absent three weeks before they obtained the twelve specimens which\r\nformed his unique and princely gift. When an independent hunter obtains\r\none, a very high price (thirty to forty milreis[1]) is asked, these\r\nmonkeys being in great demand for presents to persons of influence down\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n [1] Three pounds seven shillings to four pounds thirteen shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdult Uakarís, caught in the way just described, very rarely become\r\ntame. They are peevish and sulky, resisting all attempts to coax them,\r\nand biting anyone who ventures within reach. They have no particular\r\ncry, even when in their native woods; in captivity they are quite\r\nsilent. In the course of a few days or weeks, if not very carefully\r\nattended to, they fall into a listless condition, refuse food, and die.\r\nMany of them succumb to a disease which I suppose from the symptoms to\r\nbe inflammation of the chest or lungs. The one which I kept as a pet\r\ndied of this disorder after I had had it about three weeks. It lost its\r\nappetite in a very few days, although kept in an airy verandah; its\r\ncoat, which was originally long, smooth, and glossy, became dingy and\r\nragged like that of the specimens seen in museums, and the bright\r\nscarlet colour of its face changed to a duller hue. This colour, in\r\nhealth, is spread over the features up to the roots of the hair on the\r\nforehead and temples, and down to the neck, including the flabby cheeks\r\nwhich hang down below the jaws. The animal, in this condition, looks at\r\na short distance as though some one had laid a thick coat of red paint\r\non its countenance. The death of my pet was slow; during the last\r\ntwenty-four hours it lay prostrate, breathing quickly, its chest\r\nstrongly heaving; the colour of its face became gradually paler, but\r\nwas still red when it expired. As the hue did not quite disappear until\r\ntwo or three hours after the animal was quite dead, I judged that it\r\nwas not exclusively due to the blood, but partly to a pigment beneath\r\nthe skin which would probably retain its colour a short time after the\r\ncirculation had ceased.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing much of the morose disposition of the Uakarí, I was not a\r\nlittle surprised one day at a friend’s house to find an extremely\r\nlively and familiar individual of this species. It ran from an inner\r\nchamber straight towards me after I had sat down on a chair, climbed my\r\nlegs and nestled in my lap, turning round and looking up with the usual\r\nmonkey’s grin, after it had made itself comfortable. It was a young\r\nanimal which had been taken when its mother was shot with a poisoned\r\narrow; its teeth were incomplete, and the face was pale and mottled,\r\nthe glowing scarlet hue not supervening in these animals before mature\r\nage; it had also a few long black hairs on the eyebrows and lips. The\r\nfrisky little fellow had been reared in the house amongst the children,\r\nand allowed to run about freely, and take its meals with the rest of\r\nthe household. There are few animals which the Brazilians of these\r\nvillages have not succeeded in taming. I have even seen young jaguars\r\nrunning loose about a house, and treated as pets. The animals that I\r\nhad rarely became familiar, however long they might remain in my\r\npossession, a circumstance due no doubt to their being kept always tied\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe Uakarí is one of the many species of animals which are classified\r\nby the Brazilians as “mortál,” or of delicate constitution, in\r\ncontradistinction to those which are “duro,” or hardy. A large\r\nproportion of the specimens sent from Ega die before arriving at Pará,\r\nand scarcely one in a dozen succeeds in reaching Rio Janeiro alive. The\r\ndifficulty it has of accommodating itself to changed conditions\r\nprobably has some connection with the very limited range or confined\r\nsphere of life of the species in its natural state, its native home\r\nbeing an area of swampy woods, not more than about sixty square miles\r\nin extent, although no permanent barrier exists to check its dispersal,\r\nexcept towards the south, over a much wider space. When I descended the\r\nriver in 1859, we had with us a tame adult Uakarí, which was allowed to\r\nramble about the vessel, a large schooner. When we reached the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Negro, we had to wait four days whilst the custom-house\r\nofficials at Barra, ten miles distant, made out the passports for our\r\ncrew, and during this time the schooner lay close to the shore, with\r\nits bowsprit secured to the trees on the bank. Well, one morning,\r\nscarlet-face was missing, having made his escape into the forest. Two\r\nmen were sent in search of him, but returned after several hours’\r\nabsence without having caught sight of the runaway. We gave up the\r\nmonkey for lost, until the following day, when he re-appeared on the\r\nskirts of the forest, and marched quietly down the bowsprit to his\r\nusual place on deck. He had evidently found the forests of the Rio\r\nNegro very different from those of the delta lands of the Japura, and\r\npreferred captivity to freedom in a place that was so uncongenial to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_The Parauacú Monkey._—Another Ega monkey, nearly related to the\r\nUakarís, is the Parauacú (Pithecia hirsuta), a timid inoffensive\r\ncreature with a long bear-like coat of harsh speckled-grey hair. The\r\nlong fur hangs over the head, half concealing the pleasing diminutive\r\nface, and clothes also the tail to the tip, which member is well\r\ndeveloped, being eighteen inches in length, or longer than the body.\r\nThe Parauacú is found on the “terra firma” lands of the north shore of\r\nthe Solimoens from Tunantins to Peru. It exists also on the south side\r\nof the river, namely, on the banks of the Teffé, but there under a\r\nchanged form, which differs a little from its type in colours. This\r\nform has been described by Dr. Gray as a distinct species, under the\r\nname of Pithecia albicans. The Parauacú is also a very delicate animal,\r\nrarely living many weeks in captivity; but any one who succeeds in\r\nkeeping it alive for a month or two, gains by it a most affectionate\r\npet. One of the specimens of Pithecia albicans now in the British\r\nMuseum was, when living, the property of a young Frenchman, a neighbour\r\nof mine at Ega. It became so tame in the course of a few weeks that it\r\nfollowed him about the streets like a dog. My friend was a tailor, and\r\nthe little pet used to spend the greater part of the day seated on his\r\nshoulder, whilst he was at work on his board. Nevertheless, it showed\r\ngreat dislike to strangers, and was not on good terms with any other\r\nmember of my friend’s household than himself. I saw no monkey that\r\nshowed so strong a personal attachment as this gentle, timid, silent,\r\nlittle creature. The eager and passionate Cebi seem to take the lead of\r\nall the South American monkeys in intelligence and docility, and the\r\nCoaitá has perhaps the most gentle and impressible disposition; but the\r\nParauacú, although a dull, cheerless animal, excels all in this quality\r\nof capability of attachment to individuals of our own species. It is\r\nnot wanting, however, in intelligence as well as moral goodness, proof\r\nof which was furnished one day by an act of our little pet. My\r\nneighbour had quitted his house in the morning without taking Parauacú\r\nwith him, and the little creature having missed its friend, and\r\nconcluded, as it seemed, that he would be sure to come to me, both\r\nbeing in the habit of paying me a daily visit together, came straight\r\nto my dwelling, taking a short cut over gardens, trees, and thickets,\r\ninstead of going the roundabout way of the street. It had never done\r\nthis before, and we knew the route it had taken only from a neighbour\r\nhaving watched its movements. On arriving at my house and not finding\r\nits master, it climbed to the top of my table, and sat with an air of\r\nquiet resignation waiting for him. Shortly afterwards my friend\r\nentered, and the gladdened pet then jumped to its usual perch on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n_Owl-faced Night Apes._—A third interesting genus of monkeys found near\r\nEga, are the Nyctipitheci, or night apes, called Ei-á by the Indians.\r\nOf these I found two species, closely related to each other but\r\nnevertheless quite distinct, as both inhabit the same forests, namely,\r\nthose of the higher and drier lands, without mingling with each other\r\nor intercrossing. They sleep all day long in hollow trees, and come\r\nforth to prey on insects and eat fruits only in the night. They are of\r\nsmall size, the body being about a foot long, and the tail fourteen\r\ninches, and are thickly clothed with soft grey and brown fur, similar\r\nin substance to that of the rabbit. Their physiognomy reminds one of an\r\nowl, or tiger-cat: the face is round and encircled by a ruff of whitish\r\nfur; the muzzle is not at all prominent; the mouth and chin are small;\r\nthe ears are very short, scarcely appearing above the hair of the head;\r\nand the eyes are large and yellowish in colour, imparting the staring\r\nexpression of nocturnal animals of prey. The forehead is whitish, and\r\ndecorated with three black stripes, which in one of the species\r\n(Nyctipithecus trivirgatus) continue to the crown; and in the other (N.\r\nfelinus), meet on the top of the forehead. N. trivirgatus was first\r\ndescribed by Humboldt, who discovered it on the banks of the\r\nCassiquiare, near the head waters of the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nI kept a pet animal of the N. trivirgatus for many months, a young one\r\nhaving been given to me by an Indian _compadre_, as a present from my\r\nnewly-baptised godson. These monkeys, although sleeping by day, are\r\naroused by the least noise; so that, when a person passes by a tree in\r\nwhich a number of them are concealed, he is startled by the sudden\r\napparition of a group of little striped faces crowding a hole in the\r\ntrunk. It was in this way that my compadre discovered the colony from\r\nwhich the one given to me was taken. I was obliged to keep my pet\r\nchained up; it therefore, never became thoroughly familiar. I once saw,\r\nhowever, an individual of the other species (N. felinus) which was most\r\namusingly tame. It was as lively and nimble as the Cebi, but not so\r\nmischievous and far more confiding in its disposition, delighting to be\r\ncaressed by all persons who came into the house. But its owner, the\r\nMunicipal Judge of Ega, Dr. Carlos Mariana, had treated it for many\r\nweeks with the greatest kindness, allowing it to sleep with him at\r\nnight in his hammock, and to nestle in his bosom half the day as he lay\r\nreading. It was a great favourite with everyone, from the cleanliness\r\nof its habits to the prettiness of its features and ways. My own pet\r\nwas kept in a box, in which was placed a broad-mouthed glass jar; into\r\nthis it would dive, head foremost, when any one entered the room,\r\nturning round inside, and thrusting forth its inquisitive face an\r\ninstant afterwards to stare at the intruder. It was very active at\r\nnight, venting at frequent intervals a hoarse cry, like the suppressed\r\nbarking of a dog, and scampering about the room, to the length of its\r\ntether, after cockroaches and spiders. In climbing between the box and\r\nthe wall, it straddled the space, resting its hands on the palms and\r\ntips of the out-stretched fingers with the knuckles bent at an acute\r\nangle, and thus mounted to the top with the greatest facility. Although\r\nseeming to prefer insects, it ate all kinds of fruit, but would not\r\ntouch raw or cooked meat, and was very seldom thirsty. I was told by\r\npersons who had kept these monkeys loose about the house, that they\r\ncleared the chambers of bats as well as insect vermin. When approached\r\ngently my Ei-á allowed itself to be caressed; but when handled roughly,\r\nit always took alarm, biting severely, striking out its little hands,\r\nand making a hissing noise like a cat. As already related, my pet was\r\nkilled by a jealous Caiarára monkey, which was kept in the house at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n_Barrigudo Monkeys._—Ten other species of monkeys were found, in\r\naddition to those already mentioned, in the forests of the Upper\r\nAmazons. All were strictly arboreal and diurnal in their habits, and\r\nlived in flocks, travelling from tree to tree, the mothers with their\r\nchildren on their backs; leading, in fact, a life similar to that of\r\nthe Parárauáte Indians, and, like them, occasionally plundering the\r\nplantations which lie near their line of march. Some of them were found\r\nalso on the Lower Amazons, and have been noticed in former chapters of\r\nthis narrative. Of the remainder, the most remarkable is the Macaco\r\nbarrigudo, or bag-bellied monkey of the Portuguese colonists, a species\r\nof Lagothrix. The genus is closely allied to the Coaitás, or spider\r\nmonkeys, having, like them, exceedingly strong and flexible tails,\r\nwhich are furnished underneath with a naked palm like a hand, for\r\ngrasping. The Barrigudos, however, are very bulky animals, whilst the\r\nspider monkeys are remarkable for the slenderness of their bodies and\r\nlimbs. I obtained specimens of what have been considered two species,\r\none (L. olivaceus of Spix?) having the head clothed with grey, the\r\nother (L. Humboldtii) with black fur. They both live together in the\r\nsame places, and are probably only differently-coloured individuals of\r\none and the same species. I sent home a very large male of one of these\r\nkinds, which measured twenty-seven inches in length of trunk, the tail\r\nbeing twenty-six inches long; it was the largest monkey I saw in\r\nAmerica, with the exception of a black Howler, whose body was\r\ntwenty-eight inches in height. The skin of the face in the Barrigudo is\r\nblack and wrinkled, the forehead is low, with the eyebrows projecting,\r\nand, in short, the features altogether resemble in a striking manner\r\nthose of an old negro. In the forests, the Barrigudo is not a very\r\nactive animal; it lives exclusively on fruits, and is much persecuted\r\nby the Indians, on account of the excellence of its flesh as food. From\r\ninformation given me by a collector of birds and mammals, whom I\r\nemployed, and who resided a long time amongst the Tucuna Indians near\r\nTabatinga, I calculated that one horde of this tribe, 200 in number,\r\ndestroyed 1200 of these monkeys annually for food. The species is very\r\nnumerous in the forests of the higher lands, but, owing to long\r\npersecution, it is now seldom seen in the neighbourhood of the larger\r\nvillages. It is not found at all on the Lower Amazons. Its manners in\r\ncaptivity are grave, and its temper mild and confiding, like that of\r\nthe Coaitás. Owing to these traits, the Barrigudo is much sought after\r\nfor pets; but it is not hardy like the Coaitás, and seldom survives a\r\npassage down the river to Pará.\r\n\r\n_Marmosets._—It now only remains to notice the Marmosets, which form\r\nthe second family of American monkeys. Our old friend Midas ursulus, of\r\nPará and the Lower Amazons, is not found on the Upper river, but in its\r\nstead a closely-allied species presents itself, which appears to be the\r\nMidas rufoniger of Gervais, whose mouth is bordered with longish white\r\nhairs. The habits of this species are the same as those of the M.\r\nursulus, indeed it seems probable that it is a form or race of the same\r\nstock, modified to suit the altered local conditions under which it\r\nlives. One day, whilst walking along a forest pathway, I saw one of\r\nthese lively little fellows miss his grasp as he was passing from one\r\ntree to another along with his troop. He fell head foremost, from a\r\nheight of at least fifty feet, but managed cleverly to alight on his\r\nlegs in the pathway, quickly turning around, gave me a good stare for a\r\nfew moments, and then bounded off gaily to climb another tree. At\r\nTunantins, I shot a pair of a very handsome species of Marmoset, the M.\r\nrufiventer, I believe, of zoologists. Its coat was very glossy and\r\nsmooth, the back deep brown, and the underside of the body of rich\r\nblack and reddish hues. A third species (found at Tabatinga, 200 miles\r\nfurther west) is of a deep black colour, with the exception of a patch\r\nof white hair around its mouth. The little animal, at a short distance,\r\nlooks as though it held a ball of snow-white cotton in its teeth. The\r\nlast I shall mention is the Hapale pygmæus, one of the most diminutive\r\nforms of the monkey order, three full-grown specimens of which,\r\nmeasuring only seven inches in length of body, I obtained near St.\r\nPaulo. The pretty Lilliputian face is furnished with long brown\r\nwhiskers, which are naturally brushed back over the ears. The general\r\ncolour of the animal is brownish-tawny, but the tail is elegantly\r\nbarred with black. I was surprised, on my return to England, to learn\r\nfrom specimens in the British Museum, that the pigmy Marmoset was found\r\nalso in Mexico, no other Amazonian monkey being known to wander far\r\nfrom the great river plain. Thus, the smallest and apparently the\r\nfeeblest, species of the whole order, is one which has, by some means,\r\nbecome the most widely dispersed.\r\n\r\n_The Jupurá._—A curious animal, known to naturalists as the Kinkajou,\r\nbut called Jupurá by the Indians of the Amazons, and considered by them\r\nas a kind of monkey, may be mentioned in this place. It is the\r\nCercoleptes caudivolvus of zoologists, and has been considered by some\r\nauthors as an intermediate form between the Lemur family of apes and\r\nthe plantigrade Carnivora, or Bear family. It has decidedly no close\r\nrelationship to either of the groups of American monkeys, having six\r\ncutting teeth to each jaw, and long claws instead of nails, with\r\nextremities of the usual shape of paws instead of hands. Its muzzle is\r\nconical and pointed, like that of many Lemurs of Madagascar; the\r\nexpression of its countenance, and its habits and actions, are also\r\nvery similar to those of Lemurs. Its tail is very flexible towards the\r\ntip, and is used to twine round branches in climbing. I did not see or\r\nhear anything of this animal whilst residing on the Lower Amazons, but\r\non the banks of the Upper river, from the Teffé to Peru, it appeared to\r\nbe rather common. It is nocturnal in its habits, like the owl-faced\r\nmonkeys, although, unlike them, it has a bright, dark eye. I once saw\r\nit in considerable numbers, when on an excursion with an Indian\r\ncompanion along the low Ygapó shores of the Teffé, about twenty miles\r\nabove Ega. We slept one night at the house of a native family living in\r\nthe thick of the forest where a festival was going on and, there being\r\nno room to hang our hammocks under shelter, on account of the number of\r\nvisitors, we lay down on a mat in the open air, near a shed which stood\r\nin the midst of a grove of fruit-trees and pupunha palms. Past\r\nmidnight, when all became still, after the uproar of holiday-making, as\r\nI was listening to the dull, fanning sound made by the wings of impish\r\nhosts of vampire bats crowding round the Cajú trees, a rustle commenced\r\nfrom the side of the woods, and a troop of slender, long-tailed animals\r\nwere seen against the clear moonlit sky, taking flying leaps from\r\nbranch to branch through the grove. Many of them stopped at the pupunha\r\ntrees, and the hustling, twittering, and screaming, with sounds of\r\nfalling fruits, showed how they were employed. I thought, at first,\r\nthey were Nyctipitheci, but they proved to be Jupurás, for the owner of\r\nthe house early next morning caught a young one, and gave it to me. I\r\nkept this as a pet animal for several weeks, feeding it on bananas and\r\nmandioca-meal mixed with treacle. It became tame in a very short time,\r\nallowing itself to be caressed, but making a distinction in the degree\r\nof confidence it showed between myself and strangers. My pet was\r\nunfortunately killed by a neighbour’s dog, which entered the room where\r\nit was kept. The animal is so difficult to obtain alive, its place of\r\nretreat in the daytime not being known to the natives, that I was\r\nunable to procure a second living specimen.\r\n\r\n_Bats._—The only other mammals that I shall mention are the bats, which\r\nexist in very considerable numbers and variety in the forest, as well\r\nas in the buildings of the villages. Many small and curious species,\r\nliving in the woods, conceal themselves by day under the broad\r\nleaf-blades of Heliconiæ and other plants which grow in shady places;\r\nothers cling to the trunks of trees. Whilst walking through the forest\r\nin the daytime, especially along gloomy ravines, one is almost sure to\r\nstartle bats from their sleeping-places; and at night they are often\r\nseen in great numbers flitting about the trees on the shady margins of\r\nnarrow channels. I captured altogether, without giving especial\r\nattention to bats, sixteen different species at Ega.\r\n\r\n_The Vampire Bat._—The little grey blood-sucking Phyllostoma, mentioned\r\nin a former chapter as found in my chamber at Caripí, was not uncommon\r\nat Ega, where everyone believes it to visit sleepers and bleed them in\r\nthe night. But the vampire was here by far the most abundant of the\r\nfamily of leaf-nosed bats. It is the largest of all the South American\r\nspecies, measuring twenty-eight inches in expanse of wing. Nothing in\r\nanimal physiognomy can be more hideous than the countenance of this\r\ncreature when viewed from the front; the large, leathery ears standing\r\nout from the sides and top of the head, the erect spear-shaped\r\nappendage on the tip of the nose, the grin and the glistening black\r\neye, all combining to make up a figure that reminds one of some mocking\r\nimp of fable. No wonder that imaginative people have inferred\r\ndiabolical instincts on the part of so ugly an animal. The vampire,\r\nhowever, is the most harmless of all bats, and its inoffensive\r\ncharacter is well known to residents on the banks of the Amazons. I\r\nfound two distinct species of it, one having the fur of a blackish\r\ncolour, the other of a ruddy hue, and ascertained that both feed\r\nchiefly on fruits. The church at Ega was the headquarters of both\r\nkinds, I used to see them, as I sat at my door during the short evening\r\ntwilights, trooping forth by scores from a large open window at the\r\nback of the altar, twittering cheerfully as they sped off to the\r\nborders of the forest. They sometimes enter houses; the first time I\r\nsaw one in my chamber, wheeling heavily round and round, I mistook it\r\nfor a pigeon, thinking that a tame one had escaped from the premises of\r\none of my neighbours. I opened the stomachs of several of these bats,\r\nand found them to contain a mass of pulp and seeds of fruits, mingled\r\nwith a few remains of insects. The natives say they devour ripe cajús\r\nand guavas on trees in the gardens, but on comparing the seeds taken\r\nfrom their stomachs with those of all cultivated trees at Ega, I found\r\nthey were unlike any of them; it is therefore probable that they\r\ngenerally resort to the forest to feed, coming to the village in the\r\nmorning to sleep, because they find it more secure from animals of prey\r\nthan their natural abides in the woods.\r\n\r\n_Birds._—I have already had occasion to mention several of the more\r\ninteresting birds found in the Ega district. The first thing that would\r\nstrike a newcomer in the forests of the Upper Amazons would be the\r\ngeneral scarcity of birds; indeed, it often happened that I did not\r\nmeet with a single bird during a whole day’s ramble in the richest and\r\nmost varied parts of the woods. Yet the country is tenanted by many\r\nhundred species, many of which are, in reality, abundant, and some of\r\nthem conspicuous from their brilliant plumage. The cause of their\r\napparent rarity is to be sought in the sameness and density of the\r\nthousand miles of forest which constitute their dwelling-place. The\r\nbirds of the country are gregarious, at least during the season when\r\nthey are most readily found; but the frugivorous kinds are to be met\r\nwith only when certain wild fruits are ripe, and to know the exact\r\nlocalities of the trees requires months of experience. It would not be\r\nsupposed that the insectivorous birds are also gregarious; but they are\r\nso; numbers of distinct species, belonging to many different families,\r\njoining together in the chase or search of food. The proceedings of\r\nthese associated bands of insect-hunters are not a little curious, and\r\nmerit a few remarks.\r\n\r\nWhilst hunting along the narrow pathways that are made through the\r\nforest in the neighbourhood of houses and villages, one may pass\r\nseveral days without seeing many birds; but now and then the\r\nsurrounding bushes and trees appear suddenly to swarm with them. There\r\nare scores, probably hundreds of birds, all moving about with the\r\ngreatest activity—woodpeckers and Dendrocolaptidæ (from species no\r\nlarger than a sparrow to others the size of a crow) running up the tree\r\ntrunks; tanagers, ant-thrushes, humming-birds, fly-catchers, and\r\nbarbets flitting about the leaves and lower branches. The bustling\r\ncrowd loses no time, and although moving in concert, each bird is\r\noccupied, on its own account, in searching bark or leaf or twig; the\r\nbarbets visit every clayey nest of termites on the trees which lie in\r\nthe line of march. In a few minutes the host is gone, and the forest\r\npath remains deserted and silent as before. I became, in course of\r\ntime, so accustomed to this habit of birds in the woods near Ega, that\r\nI could generally find the flock of associated marauders whenever I\r\nwanted it. There appeared to be only one of these flocks in each small\r\ndistrict; and, as it traversed chiefly a limited tract of woods of\r\nsecond growth, I used to try different paths until I came up with it.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have noticed these miscellaneous hunting parties of birds,\r\nbut appear not to have observed that they are occupied in searching for\r\ninsects. They have supplied their want of knowledge, in the usual way\r\nof half-civilised people, by a theory which has degenerated into a\r\nmyth, to the effect that the onward moving bands are led by a little\r\ngrey bird, called the Uirá-pará, which fascinates all the rest, and\r\nleads them a weary dance through the thickets. There is certainly some\r\nappearance of truth in this explanation, for sometimes stray birds\r\nencountered in the line of march, are seen to be drawn into the throng,\r\nand purely frugivorous birds are now and then found mixed up with the\r\nrest, as though led away by some will-o’-the-wisp. The native women,\r\neven the white and half-caste inhabitants of the towns, attach a\r\nsuperstitious value to the skin and feathers of the Uirá-pará,\r\nbelieving that if they keep them in their clothes’ chest, the relics\r\nwill have the effect of attracting for the happy possessors a train of\r\nlovers and followers. These birds are consequently in great demand in\r\nsome places, the hunters selling them at a high price to the foolish\r\ngirls, who preserve the bodies by drying flesh and feathers together in\r\nthe sun. I could never get a sight of this famous little bird in the\r\nforest. I once employed Indians to obtain specimens for me; but, after\r\nthe same man (who was a noted woodsman) brought me, at different times,\r\nthree distinct species of birds as the Uirá-pará, I gave up the story\r\nas a piece of humbug. The simplest explanation appears to be this: the\r\nbirds associate in flocks from the instinct of self-preservation in\r\norder to be a less easy prey to hawks, snakes, and other enemies than\r\nthey would be if feeding alone.\r\n\r\n_Toucans.—Cuvier’s Toucan._—Of this family of birds, so conspicuous\r\nfrom the great size and light structure of their beaks, and so\r\ncharacteristic of tropical American forests, five species inhabit the\r\nwoods of Ega. The commonest is Cuvier’s Toucan, a large bird,\r\ndistinguished from its nearest relatives by the feathers at the bottom\r\nof the back being of a saffron hue instead of red. It is found more or\r\nless numerously throughout the year, as it breeds in the neighbourhood,\r\nlaying its eggs in holes of trees, at a great height from the ground.\r\nDuring most months of the year, it is met with in single individuals or\r\nsmall flocks, and the birds are then very wary. Sometimes one of these\r\nlittle bands of four or five is seen perched, for hours together,\r\namongst the topmost branches of high trees, giving vent to their\r\nremarkably loud, shrill, yelping cries, one bird, mounted higher than\r\nthe rest, acting, apparently, as leader of the inharmonious chorus; but\r\ntwo of them are often heard yelping alternately, and in different\r\nnotes. These cries have a vague resemblance to the syllables Tocáno,\r\nTocáno, and hence, the Indian name of this genus of birds. At these\r\ntimes it is difficult to get a shot at Toucans, for their senses are so\r\nsharpened that they descry the hunter before he gets near the tree on\r\nwhich they are perched, although he may be half-concealed amongst the\r\nunderwood, 150 feet below them. They stretch their necks downwards to\r\nlook beneath, and on espying the least movement amongst the foliage,\r\nfly off to the more inaccessible parts of the forest. Solitary Toucans\r\nare sometimes met with at the same season, hopping silently up and down\r\nthe larger boughs, and peering into crevices of the tree-trunks. They\r\nmoult in the months from March to June, some individuals earlier,\r\nothers later. This season of enforced quiet being passed, they make\r\ntheir appearance suddenly in the dry forest, near Ega, in large flocks,\r\nprobably assemblages of birds gathered together from the neighbouring\r\nYgapó forests, which are then flooded and cold. The birds have now\r\nbecome exceedingly tame, and the troops travel with heavy laborious\r\nflight from bough to bough amongst the lower trees. They thus become an\r\neasy prey to hunters, and everyone at Ega who can get a gun of any sort\r\nand a few charges of powder and shot, or a blow-pipe, goes daily to the\r\nwoods to kill a few brace for dinner; for, as already observed, the\r\npeople of Ega live almost exclusively on stewed and roasted Toucans\r\nduring the months of June and July, the birds being then very fat and\r\nthe meat exceedingly sweet and tender.\r\n\r\nNo one, on seeing a Toucan, can help asking what is the use of the\r\nenormous bill, which, in some species, attains a length of seven\r\ninches, and a width of more than two inches. A few remarks on this\r\nsubject may be here introduced. The early naturalists, having seen only\r\nthe bill of a Toucan, which was esteemed as a marvellous production by\r\nthe _virtuosi_ of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, concluded\r\nthat the bird must have belonged to the aquatic and web-footed order,\r\nas this contains so many species of remarkable development of beak,\r\nadapted for seizing fish. Some travellers also related fabulous stories\r\nof Toucans resorting to the banks of rivers to feed on fish, and these\r\naccounts also encouraged the erroneous views of the habits of the birds\r\nwhich for a long time prevailed. Toucans, however, are now well known\r\nto be eminently arboreal birds, and to belong to a group (including\r\ntrogons, parrots, and barbets[2]), all of whose members are\r\nfruit-eaters. On the Amazons, where these birds are very common, no one\r\npretends ever to have seen a Toucan walking on the ground in its\r\nnatural state, much less acting the part of a swimming or wading bird.\r\nProfessor Owen found, on dissection, that the gizzard in Toucans is not\r\nso well adapted for the trituration of food as it is in other vegetable\r\nfeeders, and concluded, therefore, as Broderip had observed the habit\r\nof chewing the cud in a tame bird, that the great toothed bill was\r\nuseful in holding and remasticating the food. The bill can scarcely be\r\nsaid to be a very good contrivance for seizing and crushing small\r\nbirds, or taking them from their nests in crevices of trees, habits\r\nwhich have been imputed to Toucans by some writers. The hollow,\r\ncellular structure of the interior of the bill, its curved and clumsy\r\nshape, and the deficiency of force and precision when it is used to\r\nseize objects, suggest a want of fitness, if this be the function of\r\nthe member. But fruit is undoubtedly the chief food of Toucans, and it\r\nis in reference to their mode of obtaining it that the use of their\r\nuncouth bills is to be sought.\r\n\r\n [2] _Capitoninæ_, G. R. Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlowers and fruit on the crowns of the large trees of South American\r\nforests grow, principally, towards the end of slender twigs, which will\r\nnot bear any considerable weight; all animals, therefore, which feed\r\nupon fruit, or on insects contained in flowers, must, of course, have\r\nsome means of reaching the ends of the stalks from a distance. Monkeys\r\nobtain their food by stretching forth their long arms and, in some\r\ninstances, their tails, to bring the fruit near to their mouths.\r\nHumming-birds are endowed with highly perfected organs of flight with\r\ncorresponding muscular development by which they are enabled to sustain\r\nthemselves on the wing before blossoms whilst rifling them of their\r\ncontents. These strong-flying creatures, however, will, whenever they\r\ncan get near enough, remain on their perches whilst probing\r\nneighbouring flowers for insects. Trogons have feeble wings, and a\r\ndull, inactive temperament. Their mode of obtaining food is to station\r\nthemselves quietly on low branches in the gloomy shades of the forest,\r\nand eye the fruits on the surrounding trees, darting off, as if with an\r\neffort, every time they wish to seize a mouthful, and returning to the\r\nsame perch. Barbets (Capitoninæ) seem to have no especial endowment,\r\neither of habits or structure, to enable them to seize fruits; and in\r\nthis respect they are similar to the Toucans, if we leave the bill out\r\nof question, both tribes having heavy bodies, with feeble organs of\r\nflight, so that they are disabled from taking their food on the wing.\r\nThe purpose of the enormous bill here becomes evident; it is to enable\r\nthe Toucan to reach and devour fruit whilst remaining seated, and thus\r\nto counterbalance the disadvantage which its heavy body and gluttonous\r\nappetite would otherwise give it in the competition with allied groups\r\nof birds. The relation between the extraordinarily lengthened bill of\r\nthe Toucan and its mode of obtaining food, is therefore precisely\r\nsimilar to that between the long neck and lips of the Giraffe and the\r\nmode of browsing of the animal. The bill of the Toucan can scarcely be\r\nconsidered a very perfectly-formed instrument for the end to which it\r\nis applied, as here explained; but nature appears not to invent organs\r\nat once for the functions to which they are now adapted, but avails\r\nherself, here of one already-existing structure or instinct, there of\r\nanother, according as they are handy when need for their further\r\nmodification arises.\r\n\r\nOne day, whilst walking along the principal pathway in the woods near\r\nEga, I saw one of these Toucans seated gravely on a low branch close to\r\nthe road, and had no difficulty in seizing it with my hand. It turned\r\nout to be a runaway pet bird; no one, however, came to own it, although\r\nI kept it in my house for several months. The bird was in a\r\nhalf-starved and sickly condition, but after a few days of good living\r\nit recovered health and spirits, and became one of the most amusing\r\npets imaginable. Many excellent accounts of the habits of tame Toucans\r\nhave been published, and therefore, I need not describe them in detail,\r\nbut I do not recollect to have seen any notice of their intelligence\r\nand confiding disposition under domestication, in which qualities my\r\npet seemed to be almost equal to parrots. I allowed Tocáno to go free\r\nabout the house, contrary to my usual practice with pet animals, he\r\nnever, however, mounted my working-table after a smart correction which\r\nhe received the first time he did it. He used to sleep on the top of a\r\nbox in a corner of the room, in the usual position of these birds,\r\nnamely, with the long tail laid right over on the back, and the beak\r\nthrust underneath the wing. He ate of everything that we eat; beef,\r\nturtle, fish, farinha, fruit, and was a constant attendant at our\r\ntable—a cloth spread on a mat. His appetite was most ravenous, and his\r\npowers of digestion quite wonderful. He got to know the meal hours to a\r\nnicety, and we found it very difficult, after the first week or two, to\r\nkeep him away from the dining-room, where he had become very impudent\r\nand troublesome. We tried to shut him out by enclosing him in the\r\nbackyard, which was separated by a high fence from the street on which\r\nour front door opened, but he used to climb the fence and hop round by\r\na long circuit to the dining-room, making his appearance with the\r\ngreatest punctuality as the meal was placed on the table. He acquired\r\nthe habit, afterwards, of rambling about the street near our house, and\r\none day he was stolen, so we gave him up for lost. But two days\r\nafterwards he stepped through the open doorway at dinner hour, with his\r\nold gait, and sly magpie-like expression, having escaped from the house\r\nwhere he had been guarded by the person who had stolen him, and which\r\nwas situated at the further end of the village.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurl-crested Toucan.\r\n\r\n_The Curl-crested Toucan (Pteroglossus Beauharnaisii)._—Of the four\r\nsmaller Toucans, or Arassaris, found near Ega, the Pteroglossus\r\nflavirostris is perhaps the most beautiful in colours, its breast being\r\nadorned with broad belts of rich crimson and black; but the most\r\ncurious species, by far, is the Curl-crested, or Beauharnais Toucan.\r\nThe feathers on the head of this singular bird are transformed into\r\nthin, horny plates, of a lustrous black colour, curled up at the ends,\r\nand resembling shavings of steel or ebony-wood: the curly crest being\r\narranged on the crown in the form of a wig. Mr. Wallace and I first met\r\nwith this species, on ascending the Amazons, at the mouth of the\r\nSolimoens; from that point it continues as a rather common bird on the\r\nterra firma, at least on the south side of the river as far as Fonte\r\nBoa, but I did not hear of its being found further to the west. It\r\nappears in large flocks in the forests near Ega in May and June, when\r\nit has completed its moult. I did not find these bands congregated at\r\nfruit-trees, but always wandering through the forest, hopping from\r\nbranch to branch amongst the lower trees, and partly concealed amongst\r\nthe foliage. None of the Arassarís, to my knowledge, make a yelping\r\nnoise like that uttered by the larger Toucans (Ramphastos); the notes\r\nof the curl-crested species are very singular, resembling the croaking\r\nof frogs. I had an amusing adventure one day with these birds. I had\r\nshot one from a rather high tree in a dark glen in the forest, and\r\nentered the thicket where the bird had fallen to secure my booty. It\r\nwas only wounded, and on my attempting to seize it, set up a loud\r\nscream. In an instant, as if by magic, the shady nook seemed alive with\r\nthese birds, although there was certainly none visible when I entered\r\nthe jungle. They descended towards me, hopping from bough to bough,\r\nsome of them swinging on the loops and cables of woody lianas, and all\r\ncroaking and fluttering their wings like so many furies. If I had had a\r\nlong stick in my hand I could have knocked several of them over. After\r\nkilling the wounded one, I began to prepare for obtaining more\r\nspecimens and punishing the viragos for their boldness; but the\r\nscreaming of their companion having ceased, they remounted the trees,\r\nand before I could reload, every one of them had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventure with Curl-crested Toucans.\r\n\r\n_Insects._—Upwards of 7000 species of insects were found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ega. I must confine myself in this place to a few\r\nremarks on the order Lepidoptera, and on the ants, several kinds of\r\nwhich, found chiefly on the Upper Amazons, exhibit the most\r\nextraordinary instincts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuspended cocoon of Moth.\r\n\r\nI found about 550 distinct species of butterflies at Ega. Those who\r\nknow a little of Entomology will be able to form some idea of the\r\nriches of the place in this department, when I mention that eighteen\r\nspecies of true Papilio (the swallow-tail genus) were found within ten\r\nminutes’ walk of my house. No fact could speak more plainly for the\r\nsurpassing exuberance of the vegetation, the varied nature of the land,\r\nthe perennial warmth and humidity of the climate. But no description\r\ncan convey an adequate notion of the beauty and diversity in form and\r\ncolour of this class of insects in the neighbourhood of Ega. I paid\r\nspecial attention to them, having found that this tribe was better\r\nadapted than almost any other group of animals or plants to furnish\r\nfacts in illustration of the modifications which all species undergo in\r\nnature, under changed local conditions. This accidental superiority is\r\nowing partly to the simplicity and distinctness of the specific\r\ncharacter of the insects, and partly to the facility with which very\r\ncopious series of specimens can be collected and placed side by side\r\nfor comparison. The distinctness of the specific characters is due\r\nprobably to the fact that all the superficial signs of change in the\r\norganisation are exaggerated, and made unusually plain by affecting the\r\nframework, shape, and colour of the wings, which, as many anatomists\r\nbelieve, are magnified extensions of the skin around the breathing\r\norifices of the thorax of the insects. These expansions are clothed\r\nwith minute feathers or scales, coloured in regular patterns, which\r\nvary in accordance with the slightest change in the conditions to which\r\nthe species are exposed. It may be said, therefore, that on these\r\nexpanded membranes Nature writes, as on a tablet, the story of the\r\nmodifications of species, so truly do all changes of the organisation\r\nregister themselves thereon. Moreover, the same colour-patterns of the\r\nwings generally show, with great regularity, the degrees of\r\nblood-relationship of the species. As the laws of Nature must be the\r\nsame for all beings, the conclusions furnished by this group of insects\r\nmust be applicable to the whole organic world; therefore, the study of\r\nbutterflies—creatures selected as the types of airiness and\r\nfrivolity—instead of being despised, will some day be valued as one of\r\nthe most important branches of Biological science.\r\n\r\n\r\nSack-bearing Caterpillar (Saccophora).\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the ants, a few remarks may be made on\r\nthe singular cases and cocoons woven by the caterpillars of certain\r\nmoths found at Ega. The first that may be mentioned is one of the most\r\nbeautiful examples of insect workmanship I ever saw. It is a cocoon,\r\nabout the size of a sparrow’s egg, woven by a caterpillar in broad\r\nmeshes of either buff or rose-coloured silk, and is frequently seen in\r\nthe narrow alleys of the forest, suspended from the extreme tip of an\r\noutstanding leaf by a strong silken thread five or six inches in\r\nlength. It forms a very conspicuous object, hanging thus in mid-air.\r\nThe glossy threads with which it is knitted are stout, and the\r\nstructure is therefore not liable to be torn by the beaks of\r\ninsectivorous birds, whilst its pendulous position makes it doubly\r\nsecure against their attacks, the apparatus giving way when they peck\r\nat it. There is a small orifice at each end of the egg-shaped bag, to\r\nadmit of the escape of the moth when it changes from the little\r\nchrysalis which sleeps tranquilly in its airy cage. The moth is of a\r\ndull slatey colour, and belongs to the Lithosiide group of the\r\nsilk-worm family (Bombycidæ). When the caterpillar begins its work, it\r\nlets itself down from the tip of the leaf which it has chosen by\r\nspinning a thread of silk, the thickness of which it slowly increases\r\nas it descends. Having given the proper length to the cord, it proceeds\r\nto weave its elegant bag, placing itself in the centre and spinning\r\nrings of silk at regular intervals, connecting them at the same time by\r\nmeans of cross threads; so that the whole, when finished, forms a loose\r\nweb, with quadrangular meshes of nearly equal size throughout. The task\r\noccupies about four days: when finished, the enclosed caterpillar\r\nbecomes sluggish, its skin shrivels and cracks, and there then remains\r\na motionless chrysalis of narrow shape, leaning against the sides of\r\nits silken cage.\r\n\r\nMany other kinds are found at Ega belonging to the same cocoon-weaving\r\nfamily, some of which differ from the rest in their caterpillars\r\npossessing the art of fabricating cases with fragments of wood or\r\nleaves, in which they live secure from all enemies whilst they are\r\nfeeding and growing. I saw many species of these; some of them knitted\r\ntogether, with fine silken threads, small bits of stick, and so made\r\ntubes similar to those of caddice-worms; others (Saccophora) chose\r\nleaves for the same purpose, forming with them an elongated bag open at\r\nboth ends, and having the inside lined with a thick web. The tubes of\r\nfull-grown caterpillars of Saccophora are two inches in length, and it\r\nis at this stage of growth that I have generally seen them. They feed\r\non the leaves of Melastoniæ, and as in crawling, the weight of so large\r\na dwelling would be greater than the contained caterpillar could\r\nsustain, the insect attaches the case by one or more threads to the\r\nleaves or twigs near which it is feeding.\r\n\r\n_Foraging Ants._—Many confused statements have been published in books\r\nof travel, and copied in Natural History works, regarding these ants,\r\nwhich appear to have been confounded with the Saüba, a sketch of whose\r\nhabits has been given in the first chapter of this work. The Saüba is a\r\nvegetable feeder, and does not attack other animals; the accounts that\r\nhave been published regarding carnivorous ants which hunt in vast\r\narmies, exciting terror wherever they go, apply only to the Ecitons, or\r\nforaging ants, a totally different group of this tribe of insects. The\r\nEcitons are called Tauóca by the Indians, who are always on the\r\nlook-out for their armies when they traverse the forest, so as to avoid\r\nbeing attacked. I met with ten distinct species of them, nearly all of\r\nwhich have a different system of marching; eight were new to science\r\nwhen I sent them to England. Some are found commonly in every part of\r\nthe country, and one is peculiar to the open campos of Santarem; but,\r\nas nearly all the species are found together at Ega, where the forest\r\nswarmed with their armies, I have left an account of the habits of the\r\nwhole genus for this part of my narrative. The Ecitons resemble, in\r\ntheir habits, the Driver ants of Tropical Africa; but they have no\r\nclose relationship with them in structure, and indeed belong to quite\r\nanother sub-group of the ant-tribe.\r\n\r\nLike many other ants, the communities of Ecitons are composed, besides\r\nmales and females, of two classes of workers, a large-headed\r\n(worker-major) and a small-headed (worker-minor) class; the large-heads\r\nhave, in some species, greatly lengthened jaws, the small-heads have\r\njaws always of the ordinary shape; but the two classes are not\r\nsharply-defined in structure and function, except in two of the\r\nspecies. There is in all of them a little difference amongst the\r\nworkers regarding the size of the head; but in some species this is not\r\nsufficient to cause a separation into classes, with division of labour;\r\nin others, the jaws are so monstrously lengthened in the worker-majors,\r\nthat they are incapacitated from taking part in the labours which the\r\nworker-minors perform; and again, in others the difference is so great\r\nthat the distinction of classes becomes complete, one acting the part\r\nof soldiers, and the other that of workers. The peculiar feature in the\r\nhabits of the Eciton genus is their hunting for prey in regular bodies,\r\nor armies. It is this which chiefly distinguishes them from the genus\r\nof common red stinging-ants, several species of which inhabit England,\r\nwhose habit is to search for food in the usual irregular manner. All\r\nthe Ecitons hunt in large organised bodies; but almost every species\r\nhas its own special manner of hunting.\r\n\r\n_Eciton rapax._—One of the foragers, Eciton rapax, the giant of its\r\ngenus, whose worker-majors are half-an-inch in length, hunts in single\r\nfile through the forest. There is no division into classes amongst its\r\nworkers, although the difference in size is very great, some being\r\nscarcely one-half the length of others. The head and jaws, however, are\r\nalways of the same shape, and a gradation in size is presented from the\r\nlargest to the smallest, so that all are able to take part in the\r\ncommon labours of the colony. The chief employment of the species seems\r\nto be plundering the nests of a large and defenseless ant of another\r\ngenus (Formica), whose mangled bodies I have often seen in their\r\npossession as they were marching away. The armies of Eciton rapax are\r\nnever very numerous.\r\n\r\n_Eciton legionis._—Another species, E. legionis, agrees with E. rapax\r\nin having workers not rigidly divisible into two classes; but it is\r\nmuch smaller in size, not differing greatly, in this respect, from our\r\ncommon English red ant (Myrmica rubra), which it also resembles in\r\ncolour. The Eciton legionis lives in open places, and was seen only on\r\nthe sandy campos of Santarem. The movement of its hosts were,\r\ntherefore, much more easy to observe than those of all other kinds,\r\nwhich inhabit solely the densest thickets; its sting and bite, also,\r\nwere less formidable than those of other species. The armies of E.\r\nlegionis consist of many thousands of individuals, and move in rather\r\nbroad columns. They are just as quick to break line, on being\r\ndisturbed, and attack hurriedly and furiously any intruding object, as\r\nthe other Ecitons. The species is not a common one, and I seldom had\r\ngood opportunities to watch its habits. The first time I saw an army\r\nwas one evening near sunset. The column consisted of two trains of\r\nants, moving in opposite directions; one train empty-handed, the other\r\nladen with the mangled remains of insects, chiefly larvæ and pupæ of\r\nother ants. I had no difficulty in tracing the line to the spot from\r\nwhich they were conveying their booty: this was a low thicket; the\r\nEcitons were moving rapidly about a heap of dead leaves; but as the\r\nshort tropical twilight was deepening rapidly, and I had no wish to be\r\nbenighted on the lonely campos, I deferred further examination until\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, no trace of ants could be found near the\r\nplace where I had seen them the preceding day, nor were there signs of\r\ninsects of any description in the thicket, but at the distance of\r\neighty or one hundred yards, I came upon the same army, engaged,\r\nevidently, on a razzia of a similar kind to that of the previous\r\nevening, but requiring other resources of their instinct, owing to the\r\nnature of the ground. They were eagerly occupied on the face of an\r\ninclined bank of light earth, in excavating mines, whence, from a depth\r\nof eight or ten inches, they were extracting the bodies of a bulky\r\nspecies of ant, of the genus Formica. It was curious to see them\r\ncrowding around the orifices of the mines, some assisting their\r\ncomrades to lift out the bodies of the Formicæ, and others tearing them\r\nin pieces, on account of their weight being too great for a single\r\nEciton; a number of carriers seizing each a fragment, and carrying it\r\noff down the slope. On digging into the earth with a small trowel near\r\nthe entrances of the mines, I found the nests of the Formicæ, with\r\ngrubs and cocoons, which the Ecitons were thus invading, at a depth of\r\nabout eight inches from the surface. The eager freebooters rushed in as\r\nfast as I excavated, and seized the ants in my fingers as I picked them\r\nout, so that I had some difficulty in rescuing a few intact for\r\nspecimens. In digging the numerous mines to get at their prey, the\r\nlittle Ecitons seemed to be divided into parties, one set excavating,\r\nand another set carrying away the grains of earth. When the shafts\r\nbecame rather deep, the mining parties had to climb up the sides each\r\ntime they wished to cast out a pellet of earth; but their work was\r\nlightened for them by comrades, who stationed themselves at the mouth\r\nof the shaft, and relieved them of their burthens, carrying the\r\nparticles, with an appearance of foresight which quite staggered me, a\r\nsufficient distance from the edge of the hole to prevent them from\r\nrolling in again. All the work seemed thus to be performed by\r\nintelligent co-operation amongst the host of eager little creatures,\r\nbut still there was not a rigid division of labour, for some of them,\r\nwhose proceedings I watched, acted at one time as carriers of pellets,\r\nand at another as miners, and all shortly afterwards assumed the office\r\nof conveyors of the spoil.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours, all the nests of Formicæ were rifled, though not\r\ncompletely, of their contents, and I turned towards the army of\r\nEcitons, which were carrying away the mutilated remains. For some\r\ndistance there were many separate lines of them moving along the slope\r\nof the bank; but a short distance off, these all converged, and then\r\nformed one close and broad column, which continued for some sixty or\r\nseventy yards, and terminated at one of those large termitariums or\r\nhillocks of white ants which are constructed of cemented material as\r\nhard as stone. The broad and compact column of ants moved up the steep\r\nsides of the hillock in a continued stream; many, which had hitherto\r\ntrotted along empty-handed, now turned to assist their comrades with\r\ntheir heavy loads, and the whole descended into a spacious gallery or\r\nmine, opening on the top of the termitarium. I did not try to reach the\r\nnest, which I supposed to lie at the bottom of the broad mine, and\r\ntherefore, in the middle of the base of the stony hillock.\r\n\r\n_Eciton drepanophora._—The commonest species of foraging ants are the\r\nEciton hamata and E. drepanophora, two kinds which resemble each other\r\nso closely that it requires attentive examination to distinguish them;\r\nyet their armies never intermingle, although moving in the same woods\r\nand often crossing each other’s tracks. The two classes of workers\r\nlook, at first sight, quite distinct, on account of the wonderful\r\namount of difference between the largest individuals of the one, and\r\nthe smallest of the other. There are dwarfs not more than one-fifth of\r\nan inch in length, with small heads and jaws, and giants half an inch\r\nin length with monstrously enlarged head and jaws, all belonging to the\r\nsame brood. There is not, however, a distinct separation of classes,\r\nindividuals existing which connect together the two extremes. These\r\nEcitons are seen in the pathways of the forest at all places on the\r\nbanks of the Amazons, travelling in dense columns of countless\r\nthousands. One or other of them is sure to be met with in a woodland\r\nramble, and it is to them, probably, that the stories we read in books\r\non South America apply, of ants clearing houses of vermin, although I\r\nheard of no instance of their entering houses, their ravages being\r\nconfined to the thickest parts of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nForaging ants (Eciton drepanophora).\r\n\r\nWhen the pedestrian falls in with a train of these ants, the first\r\nsignal given him is a twittering and restless movement of small flocks\r\nof plain-coloured birds (ant-thrushes) in the jungle. If this be\r\ndisregarded until he advances a few steps farther, he is sure to fall\r\ninto trouble, and find himself suddenly attacked by numbers of the\r\nferocious little creatures. They swarm up his legs with incredible\r\nrapidity, each one driving his pincer-like jaws into his skin, and with\r\nthe purchase thus obtained, doubling in its tail, and stinging with all\r\nits might. There is no course left but to run for it; if he is\r\naccompanied by natives they will be sure to give the alarm, crying\r\n“Tauóca!” and scampering at full speed to the other end of the column\r\nof ants. The tenacious insects who have secured themselves to his legs\r\nthen have to be plucked off one by one, a task which is generally not\r\naccomplished without pulling them in twain, and leaving heads and jaws\r\nsticking in the wounds.\r\n\r\nThe errand of the vast ant-armies is plunder, as in the case of Eciton\r\nlegionis; but from their moving always amongst dense thickets, their\r\nproceedings are not so easy to observe as in that species. Wherever\r\nthey move, the whole animal world is set in commotion, and every\r\ncreature tries to get out of their way. But it is especially the\r\nvarious tribes of wingless insects that have cause for fear, such as\r\nheavy-bodied spiders, ants of other species, maggots, caterpillars,\r\nlarvæ of cockroaches and so forth, all of which live under fallen\r\nleaves, or in decaying wood. The Ecitons do not mount very high on\r\ntrees, and therefore the nestlings of birds are not much incommoded by\r\nthem. The mode of operation of these armies, which I ascertained only\r\nafter long-continued observation, is as follows: the main column, from\r\nfour to six deep, moves forward in a given direction, clearing the\r\nground of all animal matter dead or alive, and throwing off here and\r\nthere a thinner column to forage for a short time on the flanks of the\r\nmain army, and re-enter it again after their task is accomplished. If\r\nsome very rich place be encountered anywhere near the line of march,\r\nfor example, a mass of rotten wood abounding in insect larvæ, a delay\r\ntakes place, and a very strong force of ants is concentrated upon it.\r\nThe excited creatures search every cranny and tear in pieces all the\r\nlarge grubs they drag to light. It is curious to see them attack wasps’\r\nnests, which are sometimes built on low shrubs. They gnaw away the\r\npapery covering to get at the larvæ, pupæ, and newly-hatched wasps, and\r\ncut everything to tatters, regardless of the infuriated owners which\r\nare flying about them. In bearing off their spoil in fragments, the\r\npieces are apportioned to the carriers with some degree of regard to\r\nfairness of load: the dwarfs taking the smallest pieces, and the\r\nstrongest fellows with small heads the heaviest portions. Sometimes two\r\nants join together in carrying one piece, but the worker-majors, with\r\ntheir unwieldy and distorted jaws, are incapacitated from taking any\r\npart in the labour. The armies never march far on a beaten path, but\r\nseem to prefer the entangled thickets where it is seldom possible to\r\nfollow them. I have traced an army sometimes for half a mile or more,\r\nbut was never able to find one that had finished its day’s course and\r\nreturned to its hive. Indeed, I never met with a hive; whenever the\r\nEcitons were seen, they were always on the march.\r\n\r\nI thought one day, at Villa Nova, that I had come upon a migratory\r\nhorde of this indefatigable ant. The place was a tract of open ground\r\nnear the river side, just outside the edge of the forest, and\r\nsurrounded by rocks and shrubbery. A dense column of Ecitons was seen\r\nextending from the rocks on one side of the little haven, traversing\r\nthe open space, and ascending the opposite declivity. The length of the\r\nprocession was from sixty to seventy yards, and yet neither van nor\r\nrear was visible. All were moving in one and the same direction, except\r\na few individuals on the outside of the column, which were running\r\nrearward, trotting along for a short distance, and then turning again\r\nto follow the same course as the main body. But these rearward\r\nmovements were going on continually from one end to the other of the\r\nline, and there was every appearance of there being a means of keeping\r\nup a common understanding amongst all the members of the army, for the\r\nretrograding ants stopped very often for a moment to touch one or other\r\nof their onward-moving comrades with their antennæ; a proceeding which\r\nhas been noticed in other ants, and supposed to be their mode of\r\nconveying intelligence. When I interfered with the column or abstracted\r\nan individual from it, news of the disturbance was very quickly\r\ncommunicated to a distance of several yards towards the rear, and the\r\ncolumn at that point commenced retreating. All the small-headed workers\r\ncarried in their jaws a little cluster of white maggots, which I\r\nthought at the time, might be young larvæ of their own colony, but\r\nafterwards found reason to conclude were the grubs of some other\r\nspecies whose nests they had been plundering, the procession being most\r\nlikely not a migration, but a column on a marauding expedition.\r\n\r\nThe position of the large-headed individuals in the marching column was\r\nrather curious. There was one of these extraordinary fellows to about a\r\nscore of the smaller class. None of them carried anything in their\r\nmouths, but all trotted along empty-handed and outside the column, at\r\npretty regular intervals from each other, like subaltern officers in a\r\nmarching regiment of soldiers. It was easy to be tolerably exact in\r\nthis observation, for their shining white heads made them very\r\nconspicuous amongst the rest, bobbing up and down as the column passed\r\nover the inequalities of the road. I did not see them change their\r\nposition, or take any notice of their small-headed comrades marching in\r\nthe column, and when I disturbed the line, they did not prance forth or\r\nshow fight so eagerly as the others. These large-headed members of the\r\ncommunity have been considered by some authors as a soldier class, like\r\nthe similarly-armed caste in Termites; but I found no proof of this, at\r\nleast in the present species, as they always seemed to be rather less\r\npugnacious than the worker-minors, and their distorted jaws disabled\r\nthem from fastening on a plane surface like the skin of an attacking\r\nanimal. I am inclined, however, to think that they may act, in a less\r\ndirect way, as protectors of the community, namely, as indigestible\r\nmorsels to the flocks of ant-thrushes which follow the marching columns\r\nof these Ecitons, and are the most formidable enemies of the species.\r\nIt is possible that the hooked and twisted jaws of the large-headed\r\nclass may be effective weapons of annoyance when in the gizzards or\r\nstomachs of these birds, but I unfortunately omitted to ascertain\r\nwhether this was really the fact.\r\n\r\nThe life of these Ecitons is not all work, for I frequently saw them\r\nvery leisurely employed in a way that looked like recreation. When this\r\nhappened, the place was always a sunny nook in the forest. The main\r\ncolumn of the army and the branch columns, at these times, were in\r\ntheir ordinary relative positions; but, instead of pressing forward\r\neagerly, and plundering right and left, they seemed to have been all\r\nsmitten with a sudden fit of laziness. Some were walking slowly about,\r\nothers were brushing their antennæ with their forefeet; but the\r\ndrollest sight was their cleaning one another. Here and there an ant\r\nwas seen stretching forth first one leg and then another, to be brushed\r\nor washed by one or more of its comrades, who performed the task by\r\npassing the limb between the jaws and the tongue, and finishing by\r\ngiving the antennæ a friendly wipe. It was a curious spectacle, and one\r\nwell calculated to increase one’s amazement at the similarity between\r\nthe instinctive actions of ants and the acts of rational beings, a\r\nsimilarity which must have been brought about by two different\r\nprocesses of development of the primary qualities of mind. The actions\r\nof these ants looked like simple indulgence in idle amusement. Have\r\nthese little creatures, then, an excess of energy beyond what is\r\nrequired for labours absolutely necessary to the welfare of their\r\nspecies, and do they thus expend it in mere sportiveness, like young\r\nlambs or kittens, or in idle whims like rational beings? It is probable\r\nthat these hours of relaxation and cleaning may be indispensable to the\r\neffective performance of their harder labours, but whilst looking at\r\nthem, the conclusion that the ants were engaged merely in play was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\n_Eciton prædator._—This is a small dark-reddish species, very similar\r\nto the common red stinging-ant of England. It differs from all other\r\nEcitons in its habit of hunting, not in columns, but in dense phalanxes\r\nconsisting of myriads of individuals, and was first met with at Ega,\r\nwhere it is very common. Nothing in insect movements is more striking\r\nthan the rapid march of these large and compact bodies. Wherever they\r\npass all the rest of the animal world is thrown into a state of alarm.\r\nThey stream along the ground and climb to the summits of all the lower\r\ntrees, searching every leaf to its apex, and whenever they encounter a\r\nmass of decaying vegetable matter, where booty is plentiful, they\r\nconcentrate, like other Ecitons, all their forces upon it, the dense\r\nphalanx of shining and quickly-moving bodies, as it spreads over the\r\nsurface, looking like a flood of dark-red liquid. They soon penetrate\r\nevery part of the confused heap, and then, gathering together again in\r\nmarching order, onward they move. All soft-bodied and inactive insects\r\nfall an easy prey to them, and, like other Ecitons, they tear their\r\nvictims in pieces for facility of carriage. A phalanx of this species,\r\nwhen passing over a tract of smooth ground, occupies a space of from\r\nfour to six square yards; on examining the ants closely they are seen\r\nto move, not altogether in one straightforward direction, but in\r\nvariously spreading contiguous columns, now separating a little from\r\nthe general mass, now re-uniting with it. The margins of the phalanx\r\nspread out at times like a cloud of skirmishers from the flanks of an\r\narmy. I was never able to find the hive of this species.\r\n\r\n_Blind Ecitons._—I will now give a short account of the blind species\r\nof Eciton. None of the foregoing kinds have eyes of the facetted or\r\ncompound structure such as are usual in insects, and which ordinary\r\nants (Formica) are furnished with, but all are provided with organs of\r\nvision composed each of a single lens. Connecting them with the utterly\r\nblind species of the genus, is a very stout-limbed Eciton, the E.\r\ncrassicornis, whose eyes are sunk in rather deep sockets. This ant goes\r\non foraging expeditions like the rest of its tribe, and attacks even\r\nthe nests of other stinging species (Myrmica), but it avoids the light,\r\nmoving always in concealment under leaves and fallen branches. When its\r\ncolumns have to cross a cleared space, the ants construct a temporary\r\ncovered way with granules of earth, arched over, and holding together\r\nmechanically; under this, the procession passes in secret, the\r\nindefatigable creatures repairing their arcade as fast as breaches are\r\nmade in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nForaging ants (Eciton erratica) constructing a covered road—Soldiers\r\nsallying out on being disturbed.\r\n\r\nNext in order comes the Eciton vastator, which has no eyes, although\r\nthe collapsed sockets are plainly visible; and, lastly, the Eciton\r\nerratica, in which both sockets and eyes have disappeared, leaving only\r\na faint ring to mark the place where they are usually situated. The\r\narmies of E. vastator and E. erratica move, as far as I could learn,\r\nwholly under covered roads, the ants constructing them gradually but\r\nrapidly as they advance. The column of foragers pushes forward step by\r\nstep under the protection of these covered passages, through the\r\nthickets, and upon reaching a rotting log, or other promising\r\nhunting-ground, pour into the crevices in search of booty. I have\r\ntraced their arcades, occasionally, for a distance of one or two\r\nhundred yards; the grains of earth are taken from the soil over which\r\nthe column is passing, and are fitted together without cement. It is\r\nthis last-mentioned feature that distinguishes them from the similar\r\ncovered roads made by Termites, who use their glutinous saliva to\r\ncement the grains together. The blind Ecitons, working in numbers,\r\nbuild up simultaneously the sides of their convex arcades, and\r\ncontrive, in a surprising manner, to approximate them and fit in the\r\nkey-stones without letting the loose uncemented structure fall to\r\npieces. There was a very clear division of labour between the two\r\nclasses of neuters in these blind species. The large-headed class,\r\nalthough not possessing monstrously-lengthened jaws like the\r\nworker-majors in E. hamata and E. drepanophora, are rigidly defined in\r\nstructure from the small-headed class, and act as soldiers, defending\r\nthe working community (like soldier Termites) against all comers.\r\nWhenever I made a breach in one of their covered ways, all the ants\r\nunderneath were set in commotion, but the worker-minors remained behind\r\nto repair the damage, whilst the large-heads issued forth in a most\r\nmenacing manner, rearing their heads and snapping their jaws with an\r\nexpression of the fiercest rage and defiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\nEXCURSIONS BEYOND EGA\r\n\r\n\r\nSteamboat Travelling on the Amazons — Passengers — Tunantins — Caishána\r\nIndians — The Jutahí — The Sapó — Marauá Indians — Fonte Boa — Journey\r\nto St. Paulo — Tucúna Indians — Illness — Descent to Pará — Changes at\r\nPará — Departure for England\r\n\r\n_November 7th, 1856._—Embarked on the Upper Amazons steamer, the\r\n_Tabatinga_, for an excursion to Tunantins, a small semi-Indian\r\nsettlement, lying 240 miles beyond Ega. The _Tabatinga_ is an iron boat\r\nof about 170 tons burthen, built at Rio de Janeiro, and fitted with\r\nengines of fifty horse-power. The saloon, with berths on each side for\r\ntwenty passengers, is above deck, and open at both ends to admit a free\r\ncurrent of air. The captain or “commandante,” was a lieutenant in the\r\nBrazilian navy, a man of polished, sailor-like address, and a rigid\r\ndisciplinarian; his name, Senhor Nunes Mello Cardozo. I was obliged, as\r\nusual, to take with me a stock of all articles of food, except meat and\r\nfish, for the time I intended to be absent (three months); and the\r\nluggage, including hammocks, cooking utensils, crockery, and so forth,\r\nformed fifteen large packages. One bundle consisted of a mosquito tent,\r\nan article I had not yet had occasion to use on the river, but which\r\nwas indispensable in all excursions beyond Ega, every person, man,\r\nwoman and child, requiring one, as without it existence would be\r\nscarcely possible. My tent was about eight feet long and five feet\r\nbroad, and was made of coarse calico in an oblong shape, with sleeves\r\nat each end through which to pass the cords of a hammock. Under this\r\nshelter, which is fixed up every evening before sundown, one can read\r\nand write, or swing in one’s hammock during the long hours which\r\nintervene before bedtime, and feel one’s sense of comfort increased by\r\nhaving cheated the thirsty swarms of mosquitoes which fill the chamber.\r\n\r\nWe were four days on the road. The pilot, a Mameluco of Ega, whom I\r\nknew very well, exhibited a knowledge of the river and powers of\r\nendurance which were quite remarkable. He stood all this time at his\r\npost, with the exception of three or four hours in the middle of each\r\nday, when he was relieved by a young man who served as apprentice, and\r\nhe knew the breadth and windings of the channel, and the extent of all\r\nthe yearly-shifting shoals from the Rio Negro to Loreto, a distance of\r\nmore than a thousand miles. There was no slackening of speed at night,\r\nexcept during the brief but violent storms which occasionally broke\r\nupon us, and then the engines were stopped by the command of Lieutenant\r\nNunes, sometimes against the wish of the pilot. The nights were often\r\nso dark that we passengers on the poop deck could not discern the hardy\r\nfellow on the bridge, but the steamer drove on at full speed, men being\r\nstationed on the look-out at the prow, to watch for floating logs, and\r\none man placed to pass orders to the helmsman; the keel scraped against\r\na sand-bank only once during the passage.\r\n\r\nThe passengers were chiefly Peruvians, mostly thin, anxious,\r\nYankee-looking men, who were returning home to the cities of Moyobamba\r\nand Chachapoyas, on the Andes, after a trading trip to the Brazilian\r\ntowns on the Atlantic seaboard, whither they had gone six months\r\npreviously, with cargoes of Panama hats to exchange for European wares.\r\nThese hats are made of the young leaflets of a palm tree, by the\r\nIndians and half-caste people who inhabit the eastern parts of Peru.\r\nThey form almost the only article of export from Peru by way of the\r\nAmazons, but the money value is very great compared with the bulk of\r\nthe goods, as the hats are generally of very fine quality, and cost\r\nfrom twelve shillings to six pounds sterling each; some traders bring\r\ndown two or three thousand pounds’ worth, folded into small compass in\r\ntheir trunks. The return cargoes consist of hardware, crockery, glass,\r\nand other bulky or heavy goods, but not of cloth, which, being of light\r\nweight, can be carried across the Andes from the ports on the Pacific\r\nto the eastern parts of Peru. All kinds of European cloth can be\r\nobtained at a much cheaper rate by this route than by the more direct\r\nway of the Amazons, the import duties of Peru being, as I was told,\r\nlower than those of Brazil, and the difference not being\r\ncounter-balanced by increased expense of transit, on account of weight,\r\nover the passes of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThere was a great lack of amusement on board. The table was very well\r\nserved, professed cooks being employed in these Amazonian steamers, and\r\nfresh meat insured by keeping on deck a supply of live bullocks and\r\nfowls, which are purchased whenever there is an opportunity on the\r\nroad. The river scenery was similar to that already described as\r\npresented between the Rio Negro and Ega: long reaches of similar\r\naspect, with two long, low lines of forest, varied sometimes with\r\ncliffs of red clay, appearing one after the other; an horizon of water\r\nand sky on some days limiting the view both up stream and down. We\r\ntravelled, however, always near the bank, and, for my part, I was never\r\nweary of admiring the picturesque grouping and variety of trees, and\r\nthe varied mantles of creeping plants which clothed the green wall of\r\nforest every step of the way. With the exception of a small village\r\ncalled Fonte Boa, retired from the main river, where we stopped to take\r\nin firewood, and which I shall have to speak of presently, we saw no\r\nhuman habitation the whole of the distance. The mornings were\r\ndelightfully cool; coffee was served at sunrise, and a bountiful\r\nbreakfast at ten o’clock; after that hour the heat rapidly increased\r\nuntil it became almost unbearable. How the engine-drivers and firemen\r\nstood it without exhaustion I cannot tell; it diminished after four\r\no’clock in the afternoon, about which time dinner-bell rung, and the\r\nevenings were always pleasant.\r\n\r\n_November 11th to 30th._—The Tunantins is a sluggish black-water\r\nstream, about sixty miles in length, and towards its mouth from 100 to\r\n200 yards in breadth. The vegetation on its banks has a similar aspect\r\nto that of the Rio Negro, the trees having small foliage of a sombre\r\nhue, and the dark piles of greenery resting on the surface of the inky\r\nwater. The village is situated on the left bank, about a mile from the\r\nmouth of the river, and contains twenty habitations, nearly all of\r\nwhich are merely hovels, built of lath-work and mud. The short streets,\r\nafter rain, are almost impassable on account of the many puddles, and\r\nare choked up with weeds—leguminous shrubs, and scarlet-flowered\r\nasclepias. The atmosphere in such a place, hedged in as it is by the\r\nlofty forest, and surrounded by swamps, is always close, warm, and\r\nreeking; and the hum and chirp of insects and birds cause a continual\r\ndin. The small patch of weedy ground around the village swarms with\r\nplovers, sandpipers, striped herons, and scissor-tailed fly-catchers;\r\nand alligators are always seen floating lazily on the surface of the\r\nriver in front of the houses.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I presented myself to Senhor Paulo Bitancourt, a\r\ngood-natured half-caste, director of Indians of the neighbouring river\r\nIssá, who quickly ordered a small house to be cleared for me. This\r\nexhilarating abode contained only one room, the walls of which were\r\ndisfigured by large and ugly patches of mud, the work of white ants.\r\nThe floor was the bare earth, dirty and damp, the wretched chamber was\r\ndarkened by a sheet of calico being stretched over the windows, a plan\r\nadopted here to keep out the Pium-flies, which float about in all shady\r\nplaces like thin clouds of smoke, rendering all repose impossible in\r\nthe daytime wherever they can effect an entrance. My baggage was soon\r\nlanded, and before the steamer departed I had taken gun, insect-net,\r\nand game-bag, to make a preliminary exploration of my new locality.\r\n\r\nI remained here nineteen days, and, considering the shortness of the\r\ntime, made a very good collection of monkeys, birds, and insects. A\r\nconsiderable number of the species (especially of insects) were\r\ndifferent from those of the four other stations, which I examined on\r\nthe south side of the Solimoens, and as many of these were\r\n“representative forms”[1] of others found on the opposite banks of the\r\nbroad river, I concluded that there could have been no land connection\r\nbetween the two shores during, at least, the recent geological period.\r\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the case of the Uakarí monkeys,\r\ndescribed in the last chapter. All these strongly modified local races\r\nof insects confined to one side of the Solimoens (like the Uakarís),\r\nare such as have not been able to cross a wide treeless space such as a\r\nriver. The acquisition which pleased me most, in this place, was a new\r\nspecies of butterfly (a Catagramma), which has since been named C.\r\nexcelsior, owing to its surpassing in size and beauty all the\r\npreviously-known species of its singularly beautiful genus. The upper\r\nsurface of the wings is of the richest blue, varying in shade with the\r\nplay of light, and on each side is a broad curved stripe of an orange\r\ncolour. It is a bold flyer, and is not confined, as I afterwards found,\r\nto the northern side of the river, for I once saw a specimen amidst a\r\nnumber of richly-coloured butterflies, flying about the deck of the\r\nsteamer when we were anchored off Fonte Boa, 200 miles, lower down the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n [1] Species or races which take the place of other allied species or\r\n races.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of three Mameluco families and a stray Portuguese\r\ntrader, all the inhabitants of the village and neighbourhood are\r\nsemi-civilised Indians of the Shumána and Passé tribes. The forests of\r\nthe Tunantins, however, are inhabited by a tribe of wild Indians called\r\nCaishánas, who resemble much, in their social condition and manners,\r\nthe debased Murás of the Lower Amazons, and have, like them, shown no\r\naptitude for civilised life in any shape. Their huts commence at the\r\ndistance of an hour’s walk from the village, along gloomy and narrow\r\nforest paths. My first and only visit to a Caishána dwelling was\r\naccidental. One day, having extended my walk further than usual, and\r\nfollowed one of the forest-roads until it became a mere _picada_, or\r\nhunters’ track, I came suddenly upon a well-trodden pathway, bordered\r\non each side with Lycopodia of the most elegant shapes, the tips of the\r\nfronds stretching almost like tendrils down the little earthy slopes\r\nwhich formed the edge of the path. The road, though smooth, was narrow\r\nand dark, and in many places blocked up by trunks of felled trees,\r\nwhich had been apparently thrown across by the timid Indians on purpose\r\nto obstruct the way to their habitations. Half-a-mile of this shady\r\nroad brought me to a small open space on the banks of a brook or creek,\r\non the skirts of which stood a conical hut with a very low doorway.\r\nThere was also an open shed, with stages made of split palm-stems, and\r\na number of large wooden troughs. Two or three dark-skinned children,\r\nwith a man and woman, were in the shed; but, immediately on espying me,\r\nall of them ran to the hut, bolting through the little doorway like so\r\nmany wild animals scared into their burrows. A few moments after, the\r\nman put his head out with a look of great distrust; but, on my making\r\nthe most friendly gestures I could think of, he came forth with the\r\nchildren. They were all smeared with black mud and paint; the only\r\nclothing of the elders was a kind of apron made of the inner bark of\r\nthe sapucaya-tree, and the savage aspect of the man was heightened by\r\nhis hair hanging over his forehead to the eyes. I stayed about two\r\nhours in the neighbourhood, the children gaining sufficient confidence\r\nto come and help me to search for insects. The only weapon used by the\r\nCaishánas is the blow-gun, and this is employed only in shooting\r\nanimals for food. They are not a warlike people, like most of the\r\nneighbouring tribes on the Japurá and Issá.\r\n\r\nThe whole tribe of Caishánas does not exceed 400 souls in number. None\r\nof them are baptised Indians, and they do not dwell in villages, like\r\nthe more advanced sections of the Tupi stock; but each family has its\r\nown solitary hut. They are quite harmless, do not practise tattooing,\r\nor perforate their ears and noses in any way. Their social condition is\r\nof a low type, very little removed, indeed, from that of the brutes\r\nliving in the same forests. They do not appear to obey any common\r\nchief, and I could not make out that they had Pajés, or medicine-men,\r\nthose rudest beginnings of a priest class. Symbolical or masked dances,\r\nand ceremonies in honour of the Juruparí, or demon, customs which\r\nprevail amongst all the surrounding tribes, are unknown to the\r\nCaishánas. There is among them a trace of festival keeping; but the\r\nonly ceremony used is the drinking of cashiri beer, and fermented\r\nliquors made of Indian-corn, bananas, and so forth. These affairs,\r\nhowever, are conducted in a degenerate style, for they do not drink to\r\nintoxication, or sustain the orgies for several days and nights in\r\nsuccession, like the Jurís Passés, and Tucúnas. The men play a musical\r\ninstrument, made of pieces of stem of the arrow-grass cut in different\r\nlengths and arranged like Pan-pipes. With this they wile away whole\r\nhours, lolling in ragged, bast hammocks slung in their dark, smoky\r\nhuts. The Tunantins people say that the Caishánas have persecuted the\r\nwild animals and birds to such an extent near their settlements that\r\nthere is now quite a scarcity of animal food. If they kill a Toucan, it\r\nis considered an important event, and the bird is made to serve as a\r\nmeal for a score or more persons. They boil the meat in earthenware\r\nkettles filled with Tucupi sauce, and eat it with beiju, or\r\nmandioca-cakes. The women are not allowed to taste of the meat, but\r\nforced to content themselves with sopping pieces of cake in the liquor.\r\n\r\n_November 30th._—I left Tunantins in a trading schooner of eighty tons\r\nburthen belonging to Senhor Batalha, a tradesman of Ega, which had been\r\nout all the summer collecting produce, and was commanded by a friend of\r\nmine, a young Paraense, named Francisco Raiol. We arrived, on the 3rd\r\nof December, at the mouth of the Jutahí, a considerable stream about\r\nhalf a mile broad, and flowing with a very sluggish current. This is\r\none of the series of six rivers, from 400 to 1000 miles in length,\r\nwhich flow from the south-west through unknown lands lying between\r\nBolivia and the Upper Amazons, and enter this latter river between the\r\nMadeira and the Ucayáli. We remained at anchor four days within the\r\nmouth of the Sapó, a small tributary of the Jutahí flowing from the\r\nsouth-east; Senhor Raiol having to send an igarité to the Cupatána, a\r\nlarge tributary some few miles farther up the river, to fetch a cargo\r\nof salt-fish. During this time we made several excursions in the\r\nmontaria to various places in the neighbourhood. Our longest trip was\r\nto some Indian houses, a distance of fifteen or eighteen miles up the\r\nSapó, a journey made with one Indian paddler, and occupying a whole\r\nday. The stream is not more than forty or fifty yards broad; its waters\r\nare darker in colour than those of the Jutahí, and flow, as in all\r\nthese small rivers, partly under shade between two lofty walls of\r\nforest. We passed, in ascending, seven habitations, most of them hidden\r\nin the luxuriant foliage of the banks; their sites being known only by\r\nsmall openings in the compact wall of forest, and the presence of a\r\ncanoe or two tied up in little shady ports. The inhabitants are chiefly\r\nIndians of the Marauá tribe, whose original territory comprised all the\r\nsmall by-streams lying between the Jutahí and the Juruá, near the\r\nmouths of both these great tributaries. They live in separate families\r\nor small hordes, have no common chief, and are considered as a tribe\r\nlittle disposed to adopt civilised customs or be friendly with the\r\nwhites. One of the houses belonged to a Jurí family, and we saw the\r\nowner, an erect, noble-looking old fellow, tattooed, as customary with\r\nhis tribe, in a large patch over the middle of his face, fishing under\r\nthe shade of a colossal tree in his port with hook and line. He saluted\r\nus in the usual grave and courteous manner of the better sort of\r\nIndians as we passed by.\r\n\r\nWe reached the last house, or rather two houses, about ten o’clock, and\r\nspent several hours there during the great heat of midday. The houses,\r\nwhich stood on a high clayey bank, were of quadrangular shape, partly\r\nopen like sheds, and partly enclosed with rude mud-walls, forming one\r\nor more chambers. The inhabitants, a few families of Marauás,\r\ncomprising about thirty persons, received us in a frank, smiling\r\nmanner: a reception which may have been due to Senhor Raiol being an\r\nold acquaintance and somewhat of a favourite. None of them were\r\ntattooed; but the men had great holes pierced in their ear-lobes, in\r\nwhich they insert plugs of wood, and their lips were drilled with\r\nsmaller holes. One of the younger men, a fine strapping fellow nearly\r\nsix feet high, with a large aquiline nose, who seemed to wish to be\r\nparticularly friendly with me, showed me the use of these lip-holes, by\r\nfixing a number of little white sticks in them, and then twisting his\r\nmouth about and going through a pantomime to represent defiance in the\r\npresence of an enemy. Nearly all the people were disfigured by dark\r\nblotches on the skin, the effect of a cutaneous disease very prevalent\r\nin this part of the country. The face of one old man was completely\r\nblackened, and looked as though it had been smeared with black lead,\r\nthe blotches having coalesced to form one large patch. Others were\r\nsimply mottled; the black spots were hard and rough, but not scaly, and\r\nwere margined with rings of a colour paler than the natural hue of the\r\nskin. I had seen many Indians and a few half-castes at Tunantins, and\r\nafterwards saw others at Fonte Boa, blotched in the same way. The\r\ndisease would seem to be contagious, for I was told that a Portuguese\r\ntrader became disfigured with it after cohabiting some years with an\r\nIndian woman. It is curious that, although prevalent in many places on\r\nthe Solimoens, no resident of Ega exhibited signs of the disease: the\r\nearly explorers of the country, on noticing spotted skins to be very\r\nfrequent in certain localities, thought they were peculiar to a few\r\ntribes of Indians. The younger children in these houses on the Sapó\r\nwere free from spots; but two or three of them, about ten years of age,\r\nshowed signs of their commencement in rounded yellowish patches on the\r\nskin, and these appeared languid and sickly, although the blotched\r\nadults seemed not to be affected in their general health. A middle-aged\r\nhalf-caste at Fonte Boa told me he had cured himself of the disorder by\r\nstrong doses of sarsaparilla; the black patches had caused the hair of\r\nhis beard and eyebrows to fall off, but it had grown again since his\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nWhen my tall friend saw me, after dinner, collecting insects along the\r\npaths near the houses, he approached, and, taking me by the arm, led me\r\nto a mandioca shed, making signs, as he could speak very little Tupi,\r\nthat he had something to show. I was not a little surprised when,\r\nhaving mounted the girao, or stage of split palm-stems, and taken down\r\nan object transfixed to a post, he exhibited, with an air of great\r\nmystery, a large chrysalis suspended from a leaf, which he placed\r\ncarefully in my hands, saying, “Pána-paná curí” (Tupí: butterfly\r\nby-and-by). Thus I found that the metamorphoses of insects were known\r\nto these savages; but being unable to talk with my new friend, I could\r\nnot ascertain what ideas such a phenomenon had given rise to in his\r\nmind. The good fellow did not leave my side during the remainder of our\r\nstay; but, thinking apparently that I had come here for information, he\r\nput himself to considerable trouble to give me all he could. He made a\r\nquantity of Hypadú or Coca powder that I might see the process; going\r\nabout the task with much action and ceremony, as though he were a\r\nconjuror performing some wonderful trick.\r\n\r\nWe left these friendly people about four o’clock in the afternoon, and\r\nin descending the umbrageous river, stopped, about half-way down, at\r\nanother house, built in one of the most charming situations I had yet\r\nseen in this country. A clean, narrow, sandy pathway led from the shady\r\nport to the house, through a tract of forest of indescribable\r\nluxuriance. The buildings stood on an eminence in the middle of a level\r\ncleared space; the firm sandy soil, smooth as a floor, forming a broad\r\nterrace around them. The owner was a semi-civilised Indian, named\r\nManoel; a dull, taciturn fellow, who, together with his wife and\r\nchildren, seemed by no means pleased at being intruded on in their\r\nsolitude. The family must have been very industrious, for the\r\nplantations were very extensive, and included a little of almost all\r\nkinds of cultivated tropical productions: fruit trees, vegetables, and\r\neven flowers for ornament. The silent old man had surely a fine\r\nappreciation of the beauties of nature, for the site he had chosen\r\ncommanded a view of surprising magnificence over the summits of the\r\nforest; and, to give finish to the prospect, he had planted a large\r\nquantity of banana trees in the foreground, thus concealing the charred\r\nand dead stumps which would otherwise have marred the effect of the\r\nrolling sea of greenery. The only information I could get out of Manoel\r\nwas, that large flocks of richly-coloured birds came down in the fruit\r\nseason and despoiled his trees. The sun set over the tree-tops before\r\nwe left this little Eden, and the remainder of our journey was made\r\nslowly and pleasantly, under the chequered shades of the river banks,\r\nby the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n_December 7th._—Arrived at Fonte Boa; a wretched, muddy, and\r\ndilapidated village situated two or three miles within the mouth of a\r\nnarrow by-stream called the Cayhiar-hy, which runs almost as straight\r\nas an artificial canal between the village and the main Amazons. The\r\ncharacter of the vegetation and soil here was different from that of\r\nall other localities I had hitherto examined; I had planned, therefore,\r\nto devote six weeks to the place. Having written beforehand to one of\r\nthe principal inhabitants, Senhor Venancio, a house was ready for me on\r\nlanding. The only recommendation of the dwelling was its coolness. It\r\nwas, in fact, rather damp; the plastered walls bore a crop of green\r\nmold, and a slimy moisture oozed through the black, dirty floor; the\r\nrooms were large, but lighted by miserable little holes in place of\r\nwindows. The village is built on a clayey plateau, and the ruinous\r\nhouses are arranged round a large square, which is so choked up with\r\ntangled bushes that it is quite impassable, the lazy inhabitants having\r\nallowed the fine open space to relapse into jungle. The stiff clayey\r\neminence is worn into deep gullies which slope towards the river, and\r\nthe ascent from the port in rainy weather is so slippery that one is\r\nobliged to crawl up to the streets on all fours. A large tract of\r\nground behind the place is clear of forest, but this, as well as the\r\nstreets and gardens, is covered with a dense, tough carpet of shrubs,\r\nhaving the same wiry nature as our common heath. Beneath its deceitful\r\ncovering the soil is always moist and soft, and in the wet season the\r\nwhole is converted into a glutinous mud swamp. There is a very pretty\r\nchurch in one corner of the square, but in the rainy months of the year\r\n(nine out of twelve) the place of worship is almost inaccessible to the\r\ninhabitants on account of the mud, the only means of getting to it\r\nbeing by hugging closely the walls and palings, and so advancing\r\nsideways step by step.\r\n\r\nI remained in this delectable place until the 25th of January, 1857.\r\nFonte Boa, in addition to its other amenities, has the reputation\r\nthroughout the country of being the headquarters of mosquitoes, and it\r\nfully deserves the title. They are more annoying in the houses by day\r\nthan by night, for they swarm in the dark and damp rooms, keeping, in\r\nthe daytime, near the floor, and settling by half-dozens together on\r\nthe legs. At night the calico tent is a sufficient protection; but this\r\nis obliged to be folded every morning, and in letting it down before\r\nsunset, great care is required to prevent even one or two of the\r\ntormentors from stealing in beneath, their insatiable thirst for blood,\r\nand pungent sting, making these enough to spoil all comfort. In the\r\nforest the plague is much worse; but the forest-mosquito belongs to a\r\ndifferent species from that of the town, being much larger, and having\r\ntransparent wings; it is a little cloud that one carries about one’s\r\nperson every step on a woodland ramble, and their hum is so loud that\r\nit prevents one hearing well the notes of birds. The town-mosquito has\r\nopaque speckled wings, a less severe sting, and a silent way of going\r\nto work; the inhabitants ought to be thankful the big, noisy fellows\r\nnever come out of the forest. In compensation for the abundance of\r\nmosquitoes, Fonte Boa has no piums; there was, therefore, some comfort\r\noutside one’s door in the daytime; the comfort, however, was lessened\r\nby their being scarcely any room in front of the house to sit down or\r\nwalk about, for, on our side of the square, the causeway was only two\r\nfeet broad, and to step over the boundary, formed by a line of slippery\r\nstems of palms, was to sink up to the knees in a sticky swamp.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding damp and mosquitoes, I had capital health, and enjoyed\r\nmyself much at Fonte Boa; swampy and weedy places being generally more\r\nhealthy than dry ones in the Amazons, probably owing to the absence of\r\ngreat radiation of heat from the ground. The forest was extremely rich\r\nand picturesque, although the soil was everywhere clayey and cold, and\r\nbroad pathways threaded it for many a mile over hill and dale. In every\r\nhollow flowed a sparkling brook, with perennial and crystal waters. The\r\nmargins of these streams were paradises of leafiness and verdure; the\r\nmost striking feature being the variety of ferns, with immense leaves,\r\nsome terrestrial, others climbing over trees, and two, at least,\r\narborescent. I saw here some of the largest trees I had yet seen; there\r\nwas one especially, a cedar, whose colossal trunk towered up for more\r\nthan a hundred feet, straight as an arrow; I never saw its crown, which\r\nwas lost to view, from below, beyond the crowd of lesser trees which\r\nsurrounded it. Birds and monkeys in this glorious forest were very\r\nabundant; the bear-like Pithecia hirsuta being the most remarkable of\r\nthe monkeys, and the Umbrella Chatterer and Curl-crested Toucans\r\namongst the most beautiful of the birds. The Indians and half-castes of\r\nthe village have made their little plantations, and built huts for\r\nsummer residence on the banks of the rivulets, and my rambles generally\r\nterminated at one or other of these places. The people were always\r\ncheerful and friendly, and seemed to be glad when I proposed to join\r\nthem at their meals, contributing the contents of my provision-bag to\r\nthe dinner, and squatting down amongst them on the mat.\r\n\r\nThe village was formerly a place of more importance than it now is, a\r\ngreat number of Indians belonging to the most industrious tribes,\r\nShumánas, Passés, and Cambévas, having settled on the site and adopted\r\ncivilised habits, their industry being directed by a few whites, who\r\nseem to have been men of humane views as well as enterprising traders.\r\nOne of these old employers, Senhor Guerreiro, a well-educated Paraense,\r\nwas still trading on the Amazons when I left the country in 1859: he\r\ntold me that forty years previously Fonte Boa was a delightful place to\r\nlive in. The neighbourhood was then well cleared, and almost free from\r\nmosquitoes, and the Indians were orderly, industrious, and happy. What\r\nled to the ruin of the settlement was the arrival of several Portuguese\r\nand Brazilian traders of a low class, who in their eagerness for\r\nbusiness taught the easy-going Indians all kinds of trickery and\r\nimmorality. They enticed the men and women away from their old\r\nemployers, and thus broke up the large establishments, compelling the\r\nprincipals to take their capital to other places. At the time of my\r\nvisit there were few pure-blood Indians at Fonte Boa, and no true\r\nwhites. The inhabitants seemed to be nearly all Mamelucos, and were a\r\nloose-living, rustic, plain-spoken and ignorant set of people. There\r\nwas no priest or schoolmaster within 150 miles, and had not been any\r\nfor many years: the people seemed to be almost without government of\r\nany kind, and yet crime and deeds of violence appeared to be of very\r\nrare occurrence. The principal man of the village, one Senhor Justo,\r\nwas a big, coarse, energetic fellow, sub-delegado of police, and the\r\nonly tradesman who owned a large vessel running directly between Fonte\r\nBoa and Pará. He had recently built a large house, in the style of\r\nmiddle-class dwellings of towns, namely, with brick floors and tiled\r\nroof, the bricks and tiles having been brought from Pará, 1500 miles\r\ndistant, the nearest place where they are manufactured in surplus. When\r\nSenhor Justo visited me he was much struck with the engravings in a\r\nfile of _Illustrated London News_, which lay on my table. It was\r\nimpossible to resist his urgent entreaties to let him have some of\r\nthem, “to look at,” so one day he carried off a portion of the papers\r\non loan. A fortnight afterwards, on going to request him to return\r\nthem, I found the engravings had been cut out, and stuck all over the\r\nnewly whitewashed walls of his chamber, many of them upside down. He\r\nthought a room thus decorated with foreign views would increase his\r\nimportance amongst his neighbours, and when I yielded to his wish to\r\nkeep them, was boundless in demonstrations of gratitude, ending by\r\nshipping a boat-load of turtles for my use at Ega.\r\n\r\nThese neglected and rude villagers still retained many religious\r\npractices which former missionaries or priests had taught them. The\r\nceremony which they observed at Christmas, like that described as\r\npractised by negroes in a former chapter, was very pleasing for its\r\nsimplicity, and for the heartiness with which it was conducted. The\r\nchurch was opened, dried, and swept clean a few days before Christmas\r\nEve, and on the morning all the women and children of the village were\r\nbusy decorating it with festoons of leaves and wild flowers. Towards\r\nmidnight it was illuminated inside and out with little oil lamps, made\r\nof clay, and the image of the “menino Deus,” or Child-God, in its\r\ncradle, was placed below the altar, which was lighted up with rows of\r\nwax candles, very lean ones, but the best the poor people could afford.\r\nAll the villagers assembled soon afterwards, dressed in their best, the\r\nwomen with flowers in their hair, and a few simple hymns, totally\r\nirrelevant to the occasion, but probably the only ones known by them,\r\nwere sung kneeling; an old half-caste, with black-spotted face, leading\r\noff the tunes. This finished, the congregation rose, and then marched\r\nin single file up one side of the church and down the other, singing\r\ntogether a very pretty marching chorus, and each one, on reaching the\r\nlittle image, stooping to kiss the end of a ribbon which was tied round\r\nits waist. Considering that the ceremony was got up of their own free\r\nwill, and at considerable expense, I thought it spoke well for the good\r\nintentions and simplicity of heart of these poor, neglected villagers.\r\n\r\nI left Fonte Boa, for Ega, on the 25th of January, making the passage\r\nby steamer, down the middle of the current, in sixteen hours. The sight\r\nof the clean and neat little town, with its open spaces, close-cropped\r\ngrass, broad lake, and white sandy shores, had a most exhilarating\r\neffect, after my trip into the wilder parts of the country. The\r\ndistrict between Ega and Loreto, the first Peruvian village on the\r\nriver, is, indeed, the most remote, thinly-peopled, and barbarous of\r\nthe whole line of the Amazons, from ocean to ocean. Beyond Loreto,\r\nsigns of civilisation, from the side of the Pacific, begin to be\r\nnumerous, and, from Ega downwards, the improvement is felt from the\r\nside of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n_September 5th, 1857._—Again embarked on the _ Tabatinga_, this time\r\nfor a longer excursion than the last, namely to St. Paulo de Olivença,\r\na village higher up than any I had yet visited, being 260 miles\r\ndistant, in a straight line, from Ega, or about 400 miles following the\r\nbends of the river.\r\n\r\nThe waters were now nearly at their lowest point; but this made no\r\ndifference to the rate of travelling, night or day. Several of the\r\nParaná mirims, or by-channels, which the steamer threads in the season\r\nof full-water, to save a long circuit, were now dried up, their empty\r\nbeds looking like deep sandy ravines in the midst of the thick forest.\r\nThe large sand-islands, and miles of sandy beach, were also uncovered,\r\nand these, with the swarms of large aquatic birds; storks, herons,\r\nducks, waders, and spoon-bills, which lined their margins in certain\r\nplaces, made the river view much more varied and animated than it is in\r\nthe season of the flood. Alligators of large size were common near the\r\nshores, lazily floating, and heedless of the passing steamer. The\r\npassengers amused themselves by shooting at them from the deck with a\r\ndouble-barrelled rifle we had on board. The sign of a mortal hit was\r\nthe monster turning suddenly over, and remaining floating, with its\r\nwhite belly upwards. Lieutenant Nunes wished to have one of the dead\r\nanimals on board, for the purpose of opening the abdomen, and, if a\r\nmale, extracting a part which is held in great estimation amongst\r\nBrazilians as a “remedio,” charm or medicine. The steamer was stopped,\r\nand a boat sent, with four strong men, to embark the beast; the body,\r\nhowever, was found too heavy to be lifted into the boat; so a rope was\r\npassed round it, and the hideous creature towed alongside, and hoisted\r\non deck by means of the crane, which was rigged for the purpose. It had\r\nstill some sparks of life, and when the knife was applied, lashed its\r\ntail, and opened its enormous jaws, sending the crowd of bystanders\r\nflying in all directions. A blow with a hatchet on the crown of the\r\nhead gave him his quietus at last. The length of the animal was fifteen\r\nfeet; but this statement can give but an imperfect idea of its immense\r\nbulk and weight. The numbers of turtles which were seen swimming in\r\nquiet shoaly bays passed on the road, also gave us much amusement. They\r\nwere seen by dozens ahead, with their snouts peering above the surface\r\nof the water; and, on the steamer approaching, turning round to stare,\r\nbut not losing confidence till the vessel had nearly passed, when they\r\nappeared to be suddenly smitten with distrust, diving like ducks under\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nWe had on board, amongst our deck-passengers, a middle-aged Indian, of\r\nthe Jurí tribe; a short, thickset man, with features resembling much\r\nthose of the late Daniel O’Connell. His name was Caracára-í (Black\r\nEagle), and his countenance seemed permanently twisted into a grim\r\nsmile, the effect of which was heightened by the tattooed marks—a blue\r\nrim to the mouth, with a diagonal pointed streak from each corner\r\ntowards the ear. He was dressed in European-style—black hat, coat, and\r\ntrousers—looking very uncomfortable in the dreadful heat which, it is\r\nunnecessary to say, exists on board a steamer, under a vertical sun,\r\nduring mid-day hours. This Indian was a man of steady resolution,\r\nambitious and enterprising; very rare qualities in the race to which he\r\nbelonged, weakness of resolution being one of the fundamental defects\r\nin the Indian character. He was now on his return home to the banks of\r\nthe Issá from Pará, whither he had been to sell a large quantity of\r\nsarsaparilla that he had collected, with the help of a number of\r\nIndians, whom he induces, or forces, to work for him. One naturally\r\nfeels inclined to know what ideas such a favourable specimen of the\r\nIndian race may have acquired after so much experience amongst\r\ncivilised scenes. On conversing with our fellow-passenger, I was\r\ngreatly disappointed in him; he had seen nothing, and thought of\r\nnothing, beyond what concerned his little trading speculation, his mind\r\nbeing, evidently, what it had been before, with regard to all higher\r\nsubjects or general ideas, a blank. The dull, mean, practical way of\r\nthinking of the Amazonian Indians, and the absence of curiosity and\r\nspeculative thought which seems to be organic or confirmed in their\r\ncharacter, although they are improvable to a certain extent, make them,\r\nlike commonplace people everywhere, most uninteresting companions.\r\nCaracá-í disembarked at Tunantins with his cargo, which consisted of a\r\nconsiderable number of packages of European wares.\r\n\r\nThe river scenery about the mouth of the Japurá is extremely grand, and\r\nwas the subject of remark amongst the passengers. Lieutenant Nunes gave\r\nit as his opinion, that there was no diminution of width or grandeur in\r\nthe mighty stream up to this point, a distance of 1500 miles from the\r\nAtlantic; and yet we did not here see the two shores of the river on\r\nboth sides at once; lines of islands, or tracts of alluvial land,\r\nhaving by-channels in the rear, intercepting the view of the northern\r\nmainland, and sometimes also of the southern. Beyond the Issá, however,\r\nthe river becomes evidently narrower, being reduced to an average width\r\nof about a mile; there were then no longer those magnificent reaches,\r\nwith blank horizons, which occur lower down. We had a dark and rainy\r\nnight after passing Tunantins, and the passengers were all very uneasy\r\non account of the speed at which we were travelling, twelve miles an\r\nhour, with every plank vibrating with the force of the engines. Many of\r\nthem could not sleep, myself amongst the number. At length, a little\r\nafter midnight, a sudden shout startled us: “Back her!” (English terms\r\nbeing used in matters relating to steam-engines). The pilot instantly\r\nsprung to the helm, and in a few moments we felt our paddle-box\r\nbrushing against the wall of forest into which we had nearly driven\r\nheadlong. Fortunately, the water was deep close up to the bank. Early\r\nin the morning of the 10th of September we anchored in the port of St.\r\nPaulo, after five days’ quick travelling from Ega.\r\n\r\nSt. Paulo is built on a high hill, on the southern bank of the river.\r\nThe hill is formed of the same Tabatinga clay, which occurs at\r\nintervals over the whole valley of the Amazons, but nowhere rises to so\r\ngreat an elevation as here, the height being about 100 feet above the\r\nmean level of the river. The ascent from the port is steep and\r\nslippery; steps and resting-places have been made to lighten the\r\nfatigue of mounting, otherwise the village would be almost\r\ninaccessible, especially to porters of luggage and cargo, for there are\r\nno means of making a circuitous road of more moderate slope, the hill\r\nbeing steep on all sides, and surrounded by dense forests and swamps.\r\nThe place contains about 500 inhabitants, chiefly half-castes and\r\nIndians of the Tucúna and Collína tribes, who are very little improved\r\nfrom their primitive state. The streets are narrow, and in rainy\r\nweather inches deep in mud; many houses are of substantial structure,\r\nbut in a ruinous condition, and the place altogether presents the\r\nappearance, like Fonte Boa, of having seen better days. Signs of\r\ncommerce, such as meet the eye at Ega, could scarcely be expected in\r\nthis remote spot, situate 1800 miles, or seven months’ round voyage by\r\nsailing-vessels, from Pará, the nearest market for produce. A very\r\nshort experience showed that the inhabitants were utterly debased, the\r\nfew Portuguese and other immigrants having, instead of promoting\r\nindustry, adopted the lazy mode of life of the Indians, spiced with the\r\npractice of a few strong vices of their own introduction.\r\n\r\nThe head-man of the village, Senhor Antonio Ribeiro, half-white\r\nhalf-Tucúna, prepared a house for me on landing, and introduced me to\r\nthe principal people. The summit of the hill is grassy table-land, of\r\ntwo or three hundred acres in extent. The soil is not wholly clay, but\r\npartly sand and gravel; the village itself, however, stands chiefly on\r\nclay, and the streets therefore after heavy rains, become filled with\r\nmuddy puddles. On damp nights the chorus of frogs and toads which swarm\r\nin weedy back-yards creates such a bewildering uproar that it is\r\nimpossible to carry on a conversation indoors except by shouting. My\r\nhouse was damper even than the one I occupied at Fonte Boa, and this\r\nmade it extremely difficult to keep my collections from being spoilt by\r\nmould. But the general humidity of the atmosphere in this part of the\r\nriver was evidently much greater than it is lower down; it appears to\r\nincrease gradually in ascending from the Atlantic to the Andes. It was\r\nimpossible at St. Paulo to keep salt for many days in a solid state,\r\nwhich was not the case at Ega, when the baskets in which it is\r\ncontained were well wrapped in leaves. Six degrees further westward,\r\nnamely, at the foot of the Andes, the dampness of the climate of the\r\nAmazonian forest region appears to reach its acme, for Poeppig found at\r\nChinchao that the most refined sugar, in a few days, dissolved into\r\nsyrup, and the best gunpowder became liquid, even when enclosed in\r\ncanisters. At St. Paulo refined sugar kept pretty well in tin boxes,\r\nand I had no difficulty in keeping my gunpowder dry in canisters,\r\nalthough a gun loaded overnight could very seldom be fired off in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe principal residents at St. Paulo were the priest, a white from\r\nPará, who spent his days and most of his nights in gambling and\r\nrum-drinking, corrupting the young fellows and setting the vilest\r\nexample to the Indians; the sub-delegado, an upright, open-hearted, and\r\nloyal negro, whom I have before mentioned, Senhor José Patricio; the\r\nJuiz de Paz, a half-caste named Geraldo, and lastly, Senhor Antonio\r\nRibeiro, who was Director of the Indians. Geraldo and Ribeiro were my\r\nnear neighbours, but they took offence at me after the first few days,\r\nbecause I would not join them in their drinking bouts, which took place\r\nabout every third day. They used to begin early in the morning with\r\nCashaça mixed with grated ginger, a powerful drink, which used to\r\nexcite them almost to madness. Neighbour Geraldo, after these morning\r\npotations, used to station himself opposite my house and rave about\r\nforeigners, gesticulating in a threatening manner towards me by the\r\nhour. After becoming sober in the evening, he usually came to offer me\r\nthe humblest apologies, driven to it, I believe, by his wife, he\r\nhimself being quite unconscious of this breach of good manners. The\r\nwives of the St. Paulo worthies, however, were generally as bad as\r\ntheir husbands; nearly all the women being hard drinkers, and corrupt\r\nto the last degree. Wife-beating naturally flourished under such a\r\nstate of things. I found it always best to lock myself indoors after\r\nsunset, and take no notice of the thumps and screams which used to\r\nrouse the village in different quarters throughout the night,\r\nespecially at festival times.\r\n\r\nThe only companionable man I found in the place, except José Patricio,\r\nwho was absent most part of the time, was the negro tailor of the\r\nvillage, a tall, thin, grave young man, named Mestre Chico (Master\r\nFrank), whose acquaintance I had made at Pará several years previously.\r\nHe was a free negro by birth, but had had the advantage of kind\r\ntreatment in his younger days, having been brought up by a humane and\r\nsensible man, one Captain Basilio, of Pernambuco, his padrinho, or\r\ngodfather. He neither drank, smoked, nor gambled, and was thoroughly\r\ndisgusted at the depravity of all classes in this wretched little\r\nsettlement, which he intended to quit as soon as possible. When he\r\nvisited me at night he used to knock at my shutters in a manner we had\r\nagreed on, it being necessary to guard against admitting drunken\r\nneighbours, and we then spent the long evenings most pleasantly,\r\nworking and conversing. His manners were courteous, and his talk well\r\nworth listening to, for the shrewdness and good sense of his remarks. I\r\nfirst met Mestre Chico at the house of an old negress of Pará, Tia\r\nRufina (Aunt Rufina), who used to take charge of my goods when I was\r\nabsent on a voyage, and this affords me an opportunity of giving a few\r\nfurther instances of the excellent qualities of free negroes in a\r\ncountry where they are not wholly condemned to a degrading position by\r\nthe pride or selfishness of the white race. This old woman was born a\r\nslave, but, like many others in the large towns of Brazil, she had been\r\nallowed to trade on her own account, as market-woman, paying a fixed\r\nsum daily to her owner, and keeping for herself all her surplus gains.\r\nIn a few years she had saved sufficient money to purchase her freedom,\r\nand that of her grown-up son. This done, the old lady continued to\r\nstrive until she had earned enough to buy the house in which she lived,\r\na considerable property situated in one of the principal streets. When\r\nI returned from the interior, after seven years’ absence from Pará, I\r\nfound she was still advancing in prosperity, entirely through her own\r\nexertions (being a widow) and those of her son, who continued, with the\r\nmost regular industry, his trade as blacksmith, and was now building a\r\nnumber of small houses on a piece of unoccupied land attached to her\r\nproperty. I found these and many other free negroes most trustworthy\r\npeople, and admired the constancy of their friendships and the\r\ngentleness and cheerfulness of their manners towards each other. They\r\nshowed great disinterestedness in their dealings with me, doing me many\r\na piece of service without a hint at remuneration; but this may have\r\nbeen partly due to the name of Englishman, the knowledge of our\r\nnational generosity towards the African race being spread far and wide\r\namongst the Brazilian negroes.\r\n\r\nI remained at St. Paulo five months; five years would not have been\r\nsufficient to exhaust the treasures of its neighbourhood in Zoology and\r\nBotany. Although now a forest-rambler of ten years’ experience, the\r\nbeautiful forest which surrounds this settlement gave me as much\r\nenjoyment as if I had only just landed for the first time in a tropical\r\ncountry. The plateau on which the village is built extends on one side\r\nnearly a mile into the forest, but on the other side the descent into\r\nthe lowland begins close to the streets; the hill sloping abruptly\r\ntowards a boggy meadow surrounded by woods, through which a narrow\r\nwinding path continues the slope down to a cool shady glen, with a\r\nbrook of icy-cold water flowing at the bottom. At mid-day the vertical\r\nsun penetrates into the gloomy depths of this romantic spot, lighting\r\nup the leafy banks of the rivulet and its clean sandy margins, where\r\nnumbers of scarlet, green, and black tanagers and brightly-coloured\r\nbutterflies sport about in the stray beams. Sparkling brooks, large and\r\nsmall, traverse the glorious forest in almost every direction, and one\r\nis constantly meeting, whilst rambling through the thickets, with\r\ntrickling rills and bubbling springs, so well-provided is the country\r\nwith moisture. Some of the rivulets flow over a sandy and pebbly bed,\r\nand the banks of all are clothed with the most magnificent vegetation\r\nconceivable. I had the almost daily habit, in my solitary walks, of\r\nresting on the clean banks of these swift-flowing streams, and bathing\r\nfor an hour at a time in their bracing waters; hours which now remain\r\namongst my most pleasant memories. The broad forest roads continue, as\r\nI was told, a distance of several days’ journey into the interior,\r\nwhich is peopled by Tucúnas and other Indians, living in scattered\r\nhouses and villages nearly in their primitive state, the nearest\r\nvillage lying about six miles from St. Paulo. The banks of all the\r\nstreams are dotted with palm-thatched dwellings of Tucúnas, all\r\nhalf-buried in the leafy wilderness, the scattered families having\r\nchosen the coolest and shadiest nooks for their abodes.\r\n\r\nI frequently heard in the neighbourhood of these huts, the “realejo” or\r\norgan bird (Cyphorhinus cantans), the most remarkable songster, by far,\r\nof the Amazonian forests. When its singular notes strike the ear for\r\nthe first time, the impression cannot be resisted that they are\r\nproduced by a human voice. Some musical boy must be gathering fruit in\r\nthe thickets, and is singing a few notes to cheer himself. The tones\r\nbecome more fluty and plaintive; they are now those of a flageolet, and\r\nnotwithstanding the utter impossibility of the thing, one is for the\r\nmoment convinced that somebody is playing that instrument. No bird is\r\nto be seen, however closely the surrounding trees and bushes may be\r\nscanned, and yet the voice seems to come from the thicket close to\r\none’s ears. The ending of the song is rather disappointing. It begins\r\nwith a few very slow and mellow notes, following each other like the\r\ncommencement of an air; one listens expecting to hear a complete\r\nstrain, but an abrupt pause occurs, and then the song breaks down,\r\nfinishing with a number of clicking unmusical sounds like a piping\r\nbarrel organ out of wind and tune. I never heard the bird on the Lower\r\nAmazon, and very rarely heard it even at Ega; it is the only songster\r\nwhich makes an impression on the natives, who sometimes rest their\r\npaddles whilst travelling in their small canoes, along the shady\r\nby-streams, as if struck by the mysterious sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Tucúna Indians are a tribe resembling much the Shumánas, Passés,\r\nJurís, and Mauhés in their physical appearance and customs. They lead,\r\nlike those tribes, a settled agricultural life, each horde obeying a\r\nchief of more or less influence, according to his energy and ambition,\r\nand possessing its pajé or medicine-man who fosters its superstitions;\r\nbut, they are much more idle and debauched than other Indians belonging\r\nto the superior tribes. They are not so warlike and loyal as the\r\nMundurucús, although resembling them in many respects, nor have they\r\nthe slender figures, dignified mien, and gentle disposition of the\r\nPassés; there are, however, no trenchant points of difference to\r\ndistinguish them from these highest of all the tribes. Both men and\r\nwomen are tattooed, the pattern being sometimes a scroll on each cheek,\r\nbut generally rows of short straight lines on the face. Most of the\r\nolder people wear bracelets, anklets, and garters of tapir-hide or\r\ntough bark; in their homes they wear no other dress except on festival\r\ndays, when they ornament themselves with feathers or masked cloaks made\r\nof the inner bark of a tree. They were very shy when I made my first\r\nvisits to their habitations in the forest, all scampering off to the\r\nthicket when I approached, but on subsequent days they became more\r\nfamiliar, and I found them a harmless, good-natured people.\r\n\r\nA great part of the horde living at the first Maloca or village dwell\r\nin a common habitation, a large oblong hut built and arranged inside\r\nwith such a disregard of all symmetry that it appeared as though\r\nconstructed by a number of hands, each working independently,\r\nstretching a rafter or fitting in a piece of thatch, without reference\r\nto what his fellow-labourers were doing. The walls as well as the roof\r\nare covered with thatch of palm leaves; each piece consisting of\r\nleaflets plaited and attached in a row to a lath many feet in length.\r\nStrong upright posts support the roof, hammocks being slung between\r\nthem, leaving a free space for passage and for fires in the middle, and\r\non one side is an elevated stage (_girao_) overhead, formed of split\r\npalm-stems. The Tucúnas excel over most of the other tribes in the\r\nmanufacture of pottery. They make broad-mouthed jars for Tucupi sauce,\r\ncaysúma or mandioca beer, capable of holding twenty or more gallons,\r\nornamenting them outside with crossed diagonal streaks of various\r\ncolours. These jars, with cooking-pots, smaller jars for holding water,\r\nblow-guns, quivers, matiri bags[2] full of small articles, baskets,\r\nskins of animals, and so forth, form the principal part of the\r\nfurniture of their huts both large and small. The dead bodies of their\r\nchiefs are interred, the knees doubled up, in large jars under the\r\nfloors of their huts.\r\n\r\n [2] These bags are formed of remarkably neat twine made of Bromelia\r\n fibres elaborately knitted, all in one piece, with sticks; a belt of\r\n the same material, but more closely woven, being attached to the top\r\n to suspend them by. They afford good examples of the mechanical\r\n ability of these Indians. The Tucúnas also possess the art of skinning\r\n and stuffing birds, the handsome kinds of which they sell in great\r\n numbers to passing travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe semi-religious dances and drinking bouts usual amongst the settled\r\ntribes of Amazonian Indians are indulged in to greater excess by the\r\nTucúnas than they are by most other tribes. The Juruparí or Demon is\r\nthe only superior being they have any conception of, and his name is\r\nmixed up with all their ceremonies, but it is difficult to ascertain\r\nwhat they consider to be his attributes. He seems to be believed in\r\nsimply as a mischievous imp, who is at the bottom of all those mishaps\r\nof their daily life, the causes of which are not very immediate or\r\nobvious to their dull understandings. It is vain to try to get\r\ninformation out of a Tucúna on this subject; they affect great mystery\r\nwhen the name is mentioned, and give very confused answers to\r\nquestions: it was clear, however, that the idea of a spirit as a\r\nbeneficent God or Creator had not entered the minds of these Indians.\r\nThere is great similarity in all their ceremonies and mummeries,\r\nwhether the object is a wedding, the celebration of the feast of\r\nfruits, the plucking of the hair from the heads of their children, or a\r\nholiday got up simply out of a love of dissipation. Some of the tribe\r\non these occasions deck themselves with the bright-coloured feathers of\r\nparrots and macaws. The chief wears a headdress or cap made by fixing\r\nthe breast-feathers of the Toucan on a web of Bromelia twine, with\r\nerect tail plumes of macaws rising from the crown. The cinctures of the\r\narms and legs are also then ornamented with bunches of feathers. Others\r\nwear masked dresses; these are long cloaks reaching below the knee, and\r\nmade of the thick whitish-coloured inner bark of a tree, the fibres of\r\nwhich are interlaced in so regular a manner that the material looks\r\nlike artificial cloth. The cloak covers the head; two holes are cut out\r\nfor the eyes, a large round piece of the cloth stretched on a rim of\r\nflexible wood is stitched on each side to represent ears, and the\r\nfeatures are painted in exaggerated style with yellow, red, and black\r\nstreaks. The dresses are sewn into the proper shapes with thread made\r\nof the inner bark of the Uaissíma tree. Sometimes grotesque\r\nhead-dresses, representing monkeys’ busts or heads of other animals,\r\nmade by stretching cloth or skin over a basketwork frame, are worn at\r\nthese holidays. The biggest and ugliest mask represents the Juruparí.\r\nIn these festival habiliments the Tucúnas go through their monotonous\r\nsee-saw and stamping dances accompanied by singing and drumming, and\r\nkeep up the sport often for three or four days and nights in\r\nsuccession, drinking enormous quantities of caysuma, smoking tobacco,\r\nand snuffing paricá powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nMasked-dance and wedding-feast of Tucúna Indians.\r\n\r\nI could not learn that there was any deep symbolical meaning in these\r\nmasked dances, or that they commemorated any past event in the history\r\nof the tribe. Some of them seem vaguely intended as a propitiation of\r\nthe Juruparí, but the masker who represents the demon sometimes gets\r\ndrunk along with the rest, and is not treated with any reverence. From\r\nall I could make out, these Indians preserve no memory of events going\r\nbeyond the times of their fathers or grandfathers. Almost every joyful\r\nevent is made the occasion of a festiva: weddings amongst the best. A\r\nyoung man who wishes to wed a Tucúna girl has to demand her hand of her\r\nparents, who arrange the rest of the affair, and fix a day for the\r\nmarriage ceremony. A wedding which took place in the Christmas week\r\nwhilst I was at St. Paulo was kept up with great spirit for three or\r\nfour days, flagging during the heats of mid-day, but renewing itself\r\nwith increased vigour every evening. During the whole time the bride,\r\ndecked out with feather ornaments, was under the charge of the older\r\nsquaws whose business seemed to be, sedulously, to keep the bridegroom\r\nat a safe distance until the end of the dreary period of dancing and\r\nboosing. The Tucúnas have the singular custom, in common with the\r\nCollínas and Mauhés, of treating their young girls, on their showing\r\nthe first signs of womanhood, as if they had committed some crime. They\r\nare sent up to the girao under the smoky and filthy roof, and kept\r\nthere on very meagre diet, sometimes for a whole month. I heard of one\r\npoor girl dying under this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe only other tribe of this neighbourhood concerning which I obtained\r\nany information were the Majerónas, whose territory embraces several\r\nhundred miles of the western bank of the river Jauarí, an affluent of\r\nthe Solimoens, 120 miles beyond St. Paulo. These are a fierce,\r\nindomitable, and hostile people, like the Aráras of the river Madeira;\r\nthey are also cannibals. The navigation of the Jauaarí is rendered\r\nimpossible on account of the Majerónas lying in wait on its banks to\r\nintercept and murder all travellers, especially whites.\r\n\r\nFour months before my arrival at St. Paulo, two young half-castes\r\n(nearly white) of the village went to trade on the Jauaarí the\r\nMajerónas having shown signs of abating their hostility for a year or\r\ntwo previously. They had not been long gone, when their canoe returned\r\nwith the news that the two young fellows had been shot with arrows,\r\nroasted, and eaten by the savages. Jose Patricio, with his usual\r\nactivity in the cause of law and order, despatched a party of armed men\r\nof the National Guard to the place to make inquiries, and, if the\r\nmurder should appear to be unprovoked, to retaliate. When they reached\r\nthe settlement of the horde who had eaten the two men, it was found\r\nevacuated, with the exception of one girl, who had been in the woods\r\nwhen the rest of her people had taken flight, and whom the guards\r\nbrought with them to St. Paulo. It was gathered from her, and from\r\nother Indians on the Jauaarí, that the young men had brought their fate\r\non themselves through improper conduct towards the Majeróna women. The\r\ngirl, on arriving at St. Paulo, was taken care of by Senhor José\r\nPatricio, baptised under the name of Maria, and taught Portuguese. I\r\nsaw a good deal of her, for my friend sent her daily to my house to\r\nfill the water-jars, make the fire, and so forth. I also gained her\r\ngoodwill by extracting the grub of an Œstrus fly from her back, and\r\nthus cured her of a painful tumour. She was decidedly the best-humoured\r\nand, to all appearance, the kindest-hearted specimen of her race I had\r\nyet seen. She was tall and very stout; in colour much lighter than the\r\nordinary Indian tint, and her ways altogether were more like those of a\r\ncareless, laughing country wench, such as might be met with any day\r\namongst the labouring class in villages in our own country, than a\r\ncannibal. I heard this artless maiden relate, in the coolest manner\r\npossible, how she ate a portion of the bodies of the young men whom her\r\ntribe had roasted. But what increased greatly the incongruity of this\r\nbusiness, the young widow of one of the victims, a neighbour of mine,\r\nhappened to be present during the narrative, and showed her interest in\r\nit by laughing at the broken Portuguese in which the girl related the\r\nhorrible story.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth month of my sojourn at St. Paulo I had a serious illness,\r\nan attack of the “sizoens,” or ague of the country, which, as it left\r\nme with shattered health and damped enthusiasm, led to my abandoning\r\nthe plan I had formed of proceeding to the Peruvian towns of Pebas and\r\nMoyobamba, 250 and 600 miles further west, and so completing the\r\nexamination of the Natural History of the Amazonian plains up to the\r\nfoot of the Andes. I made a very large collection at St. Paulo, and\r\nemployed a collector at Tabatinga and on the banks of the Jauaarí for\r\nseveral months, so that I acquired a very fair knowledge altogether of\r\nthe productions of the country bordering the Amazons to the end of the\r\nBrazilian territory, a distance of 1900 miles from the Atlantic at the\r\nmouth of the Pará; but beyond the Peruvian boundary I found now I\r\nshould be unable to go. My ague seemed to be the culmination of a\r\ngradual deterioration of health, which had been going on for several\r\nyears. I had exposed myself too much in the sun, working to the utmost\r\nof my strength six days a week, and had suffered much, besides, from\r\nbad and insufficient food. The ague did not exist at St. Paulo but the\r\nfoul and humid state of the village was, perhaps, sufficient to produce\r\nague in a person much weakened from other causes. The country bordering\r\nthe shores of the Solimoens is healthy throughout; some endemic\r\ndiseases certainly exist, but these are not of a fatal nature, and the\r\nepidemics which desolated the Lower Amazons from Pará to the Rio Negro,\r\nbetween the years 1850 and 1856, had never reached this favoured land.\r\nAgue is known only on the banks of those tributary streams which have\r\ndark-coloured water.\r\n\r\nI always carried a stock of medicines with me; and a small phial of\r\nquinine, which I had bought at Pará in 1851, but never yet had use for,\r\nnow came in very useful. I took for each dose as much as would lie on\r\nthe tip of a penknife-blade, mixing it with warm camomile tea. The\r\nfirst few days after my first attack I could not stir, and was\r\ndelirious during the paroxysms of fever; but the worst being over, I\r\nmade an effort to rouse myself, knowing that incurable disorders of the\r\nliver and spleen follow ague in this country if the feeling of\r\nlassitude is too much indulged. So every morning I shouldered my gun or\r\ninsect-net, and went my usual walk in the forest. The fit of shivering\r\nvery often seized me before I got home, and I then used to stand still\r\nand brave it out. When the steamer ascended in January, 1858,\r\nLieutenant Nunes was shocked to see me so much shattered, and\r\nrecommended me strongly to return at once to Ega. I took his advice,\r\nand embarked with him, when he touched at St. Paulo on his downward\r\nvoyage, on the 2nd of February. I still hoped to be able to turn my\r\nface westward again, to gather the yet unseen treasures of the\r\nmarvellous countries lying between Tabatinga and the slopes of the\r\nAndes; but although, after a short rest in Ega, the ague left me, my\r\ngeneral health remained in a state too weak to justify the undertaking\r\nof further journeys. At length I left Ega, on the 3rd of February,\r\n1859, _en route_ for England.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Pará on the 17th of March, after an absence in the\r\ninterior of seven years and a half. My old friends, English, American,\r\nand Brazilian, scarcely knew me again, but all gave me a very warm\r\nwelcome, especially Mr. G. R. Brocklehurst (of the firm of R.\r\nSinglehurst and Co., the chief foreign merchants, who had been my\r\ncorrespondents), who received me into his house, and treated me with\r\nthe utmost kindness. I was rather surprised at the warm appreciation\r\nshown by many of the principal people of my labours; but, in fact, the\r\ninterior of the country is still the “sertao” (wilderness)—a _terra\r\nincognita_ to most residents of the seaport—and a man who had spent\r\nseven years and a half in exploring it solely with scientific aims was\r\nsomewhat of a curiosity. I found Pará greatly changed and improved. It\r\nwas no longer the weedy, ruinous, village-looking place that it\r\nappeared to be when I first knew it in 1848. The population had been\r\nincreased to 20,000 by an influx of Portuguese, Madeiran, and German\r\nimmigrants, and for many years past the provincial government had spent\r\ntheir considerable surplus revenue in beautifying the city. The\r\nstreets, formerly unpaved or strewn with loose stones and sand, were\r\nnow laid with concrete in a most complete manner, all the projecting\r\nmasonry of the irregularly-built houses had been cleared away, and the\r\nbuildings made more uniform. Most of the dilapidated houses were\r\nreplaced by handsome new edifices, having long and elegant balconies\r\nfronting the first floors, at an elevation of several feet above the\r\nroadway. The large, swampy squares had been drained, weeded, and\r\nplanted with rows of almond and casuarina trees, so that they were now\r\na great ornament to the city, instead of an eyesore as they formerly\r\nwere. My old favourite road, the Monguba avenue, had been renovated and\r\njoined to many other magnificent rides lined with trees, which in a\r\nvery few years had grown to a height sufficient to afford agreeable\r\nshade; one of these, the Estrada de Sao José, had been planted with\r\ncocoa-nut palms. Sixty public vehicles, light cabriolets (some of them\r\nbuilt in Pará), now plied in the streets, increasing much the animation\r\nof the beautified squares, streets, and avenues.\r\n\r\nI found also the habits of the people considerably changed. Many of the\r\nold religious holidays had declined in importance, and given way to\r\nsecular amusements; social parties, balls, music, billiards, and so\r\nforth. There was quite as much pleasure seeking as formerly, but it was\r\nturned in a more rational direction, and the Paraenses seemed now to\r\ncopy rather the customs of the northern nations of Europe than those of\r\nthe mother country, Portugal. I was glad to see several new\r\nbooksellers’ shops, and also a fine edifice devoted to a reading-room\r\nsupplied with periodicals, globes, and maps, and a circulating library.\r\nThere were now many printing-offices, and four daily newspapers. The\r\nhealth of the place had greatly improved since 1850, the year of the\r\nyellow fever, and Pará was now considered no longer dangerous to\r\nnewcomers.\r\n\r\nSo much for the improvements visible in the place, and now for the dark\r\nside of the picture. The expenses of living had increased about\r\nfourfold, a natural consequence of the demand for labour and for native\r\nproducts of all kinds having augmented in greater ratio than the\r\nsupply, through large arrivals of non-productive residents, and\r\nconsiderable importations of money on account of the steamboat company\r\nand foreign merchants. Pará, in 1848, was one of the cheapest places of\r\nresidence on the American continent; it was now one of the dearest.\r\nImported articles of food, clothing, and furniture were mostly cheaper,\r\nalthough charged with duties varying from 18 to 80 per cent, besides\r\nhigh freights and large profits, than those produced in the\r\nneighbourhood. Salt codfish was twopence per pound cheaper than the\r\nvile salt pirarucu of the country. Oranges, which could formerly be had\r\nalmost gratis, were now sold in the streets at the rate of three for a\r\npenny; large bananas were a penny each; tomatoes were from two to three\r\npence each, and all other fruits in this fruit-producing country had\r\nadvanced in like proportion. Mandioca-meal, the bread of the country,\r\nhad become so scarce and dear and bad that the poorer classes of\r\nnatives suffered famine, and all who could afford it were obliged to\r\neat wheaten bread at fourpence to fivepence per pound, made from\r\nAmerican flour, 1200 barrels of which were consumed monthly; this was\r\nnow, therefore, a very serious item of daily expense to all but the\r\nmost wealthy. House rent was most exorbitant; a miserable little place\r\nof two rooms, without fixtures or conveniences of any kind, having\r\nsimply blank walls’ cost at the rate of £18 sterling a year. Lastly,\r\nthe hire of servants was beyond the means of all persons in moderate\r\ncircumstances; a lazy cook or porter could not be had for less than\r\nthree or four shillings a day, besides his board and what he could\r\nsteal. It cost me half-a-crown for the hire of a small boat and one man\r\nto disembark from the steamer, a distance of 100 yards.\r\n\r\nIn rambling over my old ground in the forests of the neighbourhood, I\r\nfound great changes had taken place—to me, changes for the worse. The\r\nmantle of shrubs, bushes, and creeping plants which formerly, when the\r\nsuburbs were undisturbed by axe or spade, had been left free to arrange\r\nitself in rich, full, and smooth sheets and masses over the forest\r\nborders, had been nearly all cut away, and troops of labourers were\r\nstill employed cutting ugly muddy roads for carts and cattle, through\r\nthe once clean and lonely woods. Houses and mills had been erected on\r\nthe borders of these new roads. The noble forest-trees had been cut\r\ndown, and their naked, half-burnt stems remained in the midst of ashes,\r\nmuddy puddles, and heaps of broken branches. I was obliged to hire a\r\nnegro boy to show me the way to my favourite path near Una, which I\r\nhave described in the second chapter of this narrative; the new\r\nclearings having quite obliterated the old forest roads. Only a few\r\nacres of the glorious forest near Una now remained in their natural\r\nstate. On the other side of the city, near the old road to the rice\r\nmills, several scores of woodsmen were employed under Government, in\r\ncutting a broad carriage-road through the forest to Maranham, the\r\ncapital of the neighbouring province, distant 250 miles from Pará, and\r\nthis had entirely destroyed the solitude of the grand old forest path.\r\nIn the course of a few years, however, a new growth of creepers will\r\ncover the naked tree-trunks on the borders of this new road, and\r\nluxuriant shrubs form a green fringe to the path: it will then become\r\nas beautiful a woodland road as the old one was. A naturalist will\r\nhave, henceforward, to go farther from the city to find the glorious\r\nforest scenery which lay so near in 1848, and work much more\r\nlaboriously than was formerly needed to make the large collections\r\nwhich Mr. Wallace and I succeeded in doing in the neighbourhood of\r\nPará.\r\n\r\n_June 2, 1859._—At length, on the 2nd of June, I left Pará, probably\r\nforever; embarking in a North American trading-vessel, the _Frederick\r\nDemming_, for New York, the United States route being the quickest as\r\nwell as the pleasantest way of reaching England. My extensive private\r\ncollections were divided into three portions and sent by three separate\r\nships, to lessen the risk of loss of the whole. On the evening of the\r\n3rd of June, I took a last view of the glorious forest for which I had\r\nso much love, and to explore which I had devoted so many years. The\r\nsaddest hours I ever recollect to have spent were those of the\r\nsucceeding night when, the Mameluco pilot having left us free of the\r\nshoals and out of sight of land though within the mouth of the river at\r\nanchor waiting for the wind, I felt that the last link which connected\r\nme with the land of so many pleasing recollections was broken. The\r\nParaenses, who are fully aware of the attractiveness of their country,\r\nhave an alliterative proverb, “Quem vai para (o) Pará para,” “He who\r\ngoes to Pará stops there,” and I had often thought I should myself have\r\nbeen added to the list of examples. The desire, however, of seeing\r\nagain my parents and enjoying once more the rich pleasures of\r\nintellectual society, had succeeded in overcoming the attractions of a\r\nregion which may be fittingly called a Naturalist’s Paradise. During\r\nthis last night on the Pará river, a crowd of unusual thoughts occupied\r\nmy mind. Recollections of English climate, scenery, and modes of life\r\ncame to me with a vividness I had never before experienced, during the\r\neleven years of my absence. Pictures of startling clearness rose up of\r\nthe gloomy winters, the long grey twilights, murky atmosphere,\r\nelongated shadows, chilly springs, and sloppy summers; of factory\r\nchimneys and crowds of grimy operatives, rung to work in early morning\r\nby factory bells; of union workhouses, confined rooms, artificial\r\ncares, and slavish conventionalities. To live again amidst these dull\r\nscenes, I was quitting a country of perpetual summer, where my life had\r\nbeen spent like that of three-fourths of the people in gipsy fashion,\r\non the endless streams or in the boundless forests. I was leaving the\r\nequator, where the well-balanced forces of Nature maintained a\r\nland-surface and climate that seemed to be typical of mundane order and\r\nbeauty, to sail towards the North Pole, where lay my home under\r\ncrepuscular skies somewhere about fifty-two degrees of latitude. It was\r\nnatural to feel a little dismayed at the prospect of so great a change;\r\nbut now, after three years of renewed experience of England, I find how\r\nincomparably superior is civilised life, where feelings, tastes, and\r\nintellect find abundant nourishment, to the spiritual sterility of\r\nhalf-savage existence, even though it be passed in the garden of Eden.\r\nWhat has struck me powerfully is the immeasurably greater diversity and\r\ninterest of human character and social conditions in a single civilised\r\nnation, than in equatorial South America, where three distinct races of\r\nman live together. The superiority of the bleak north to tropical\r\nregions, however, is only in their social aspect, for I hold to the\r\nopinion that, although humanity can reach an advanced state of culture\r\nonly by battling with the inclemencies of nature in high latitudes, it\r\nis under the equator alone that the perfect race of the future will\r\nattain to complete fruition of man’s beautiful heritage, the earth.\r\n\r\nThe following day, having no wind, we drifted out of the mouth of the\r\nPará with the current of fresh water that is poured from the mouth of\r\nthe river, and in twenty-four hours advanced in this way seventy miles\r\non our road. On the 6th of June, when in 7° 55′ N. lat. and 52° 30′ W.\r\nlong., and therefore about 400 miles from the mouth of the main\r\nAmazons, we passed numerous patches of floating grass mingled with\r\ntree-trunks and withered foliage. Amongst these masses I espied many\r\nfruits of that peculiarly Amazonian tree the Ubussú palm; this was the\r\nlast I saw of the Great River.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water system of the Amazons]",
